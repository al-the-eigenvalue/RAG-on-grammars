"3.1. WordClassesThere are five word classes in Nakkara. Verbs and nominals constitute the two major, open
classes of words. Spatio-temporal qualifiers, particles and interjections are smaller closed
sets. These word-classes have the following functional properties:
Verbsrefer to actions, events, activities and some states and function as the nucleus of averbal predicate. A verb-root occurs as the nucleus of a verb-complex. (See 5.1. to 5.1.3.
for details). Because major grammatical relations are coded within the verb-complex, it can
occur in isolation as a sentential unit. In other circumstances the verb-complex is supported
by a range of independent word-forms.
Nominals refer to persons, places and things and to attributes of these referents. Many
nominal forms can occur as predicate nuclei; and generally, nominals can function as noun
phrase heads, modifiers or predicates. Within a given clause, nominals can function as
core, outer-core or peripheral elements. The terms ‘core' and ‘peripheral’ are used in the
sense of Dixon (1980:294): ‘Those NPs that must be included in a sentence if it is to have a
complete sense are said to be in core function - these are intransitive subject, transitive
subject and transitive object’. The term ‘outer-core' is borrowed from Morphy (1983:81).
In Nakkaraouter-corefunctionsincludebeneficiary,purposive,associative,andsource/goal orientation (see 3.3.4.3. below). Peripheral NPs are circumstantial elements
and provide the spatio-temporal setting for a sentence.",[102]

"We do not hear */nunbawana/.
A second reduction process within the prefix extending across the stem/root morphemeboundary involves /ba/ and root/stem-initial /w/. The semivowel /w/ assimilates to the
bilabial stop of preceding /ba/ and the intervening vowel is deleted. This process is more
easily formulated in two parts:
YM-2: Labial Assimilation
- consonantal@Af->@/#P-b__(+)fi >BG|#P-b+_+|+sonorant
+peripheralThis shortening and assimilation process can be seen in the following examples:(2)(a)/Qirbatwaga-na/‘we all spoke’YM-2(a)— /Nirbt+waga-na/YM-2(b)— /Nirb+aga-na/(b)/Qurbat+worggaya-na/‘we wandered around’YM-2(a)— /Nurb+worggaya-na/YM-2(b)> /Qurbt+orggaya-na/
‘we gave it to them’/qinbat+wu-na/(c)YM-2(a) > /Qinb+wu-na/
YM-2(b) ~> /Ninb+u-na/(d)= foa-wu-na/
YM-2(a)‘they gave it to them’
> /b+wu-na/YM-2(b) — /o+u-na/
Note that YM-2 (a) and (b) do not apply to prefixes ending with the vowel /i/; the latter areirrealis; prefixes, as discussed in Palatal Adjustment Rules in 2.6.3.1 above. The irrealisy
form /irbit+waga-@ 'we will speak’, does not become /nirbaga/. The reason for this isclearly that inclusion of /i/-final forms in the rule would eliminate the formal distinction
between realis and irrealis; forms; /Nirbaga/ means ‘we speak (C/T)’.
Another morphophonemic adjustment occurring at the prefix boundary in Yurrbukka
Nakkara speech involves shortening due to palatal assimilation. As with YM-2 the wholeprocess is described with two ordered rules, YM-3(a) and YM-3(b).
YM-3: Palatal Assimilation(a){i}+»@/{#@)n-#_+y(b)fyi>@[#@yn-F4+_Relevant examples of this process are:
(3)(a)/nun-Fityu- fa/YM-3(a)‘you (2UA) will lie down'> /nun-F+yu-Na/YM-3(b) —> /nun-F+u- fa/(b)/f-Fatyinami-ya/
YM-3(a)‘you will do it’> /\-F+yinami-ya/YM-3(b) — /f)-F+inami-ya/
2.6.5. RuleOrderingOrdering of the phonological and morphophonemic rules is quite straightforward given the
arrangement and ordering above. All general M-Rules operate before the P-Rules in given
-sequence and the M-Rules of the Yurrbukka dialect apply after normal P-Rules.

PhonotacticsandWordSructureAnalysing the syllable structure of words in Nakkara highlights the effects that wordinternal morpheme boundaries have on distributional constraints; a dichotomy emerges
between the word as a sequence of morphemes and a word as a morpheme in isolation.
This distinction has some bearing on syllable structure constituency.
In the discussion following, constituent structure of the various syllable types in Nakkara is
described with reference to both mono-morphemic and multi-morphemic word structures.
An additional and equally pervasive problem is the organisation of morpheme boundaries
vis-a-vis syllable boundaries. As in other languages, the two do not always coincide. In
Nakkara this is most apparent at the morpheme boundaries where long stops are created
word-medially.
Halle and Clements (1983:15) have introduced this kind of problem to their discussion of
autosegmental phonology. Their schema for resolving this problem is equally useful for
illustratingapparent inconsistenciesin Nakkara.representations as three dimensional objects. First,It involves

"Similarly, in (108)and (109)we see verbal complementsthat in otherlanguages usually require some degree of embedding or reduction.
Partial coreferentiality has most scope where one or both of the verbs invoived in the nexus
is transitive. In these circumstances the transitive object of one verb may be coreferential
with the subject of another and it is no longer just subject coreferentiality at issue. Withintransitive-intransitve constructions a different kind of partial coreferentiality emerges.
Although the core participants are not coreferential, the set of participants involved in thetwo actions can be identical, as in the following example where the subject of the first
clause is ‘she and I' (1UAf) and the subject plus Oblique of the second clause form thesame set. (IUAf = 1M + 3Mf).",[439]

intransitive verbs a single core participant is identified in the PP as the intransitive subject(S). Outer-core and peripheral functions associated with an intransitive verb are never
coded within the structure of the VC; they occur independently as NPs or Oblique
pronouns.
A transitive verb generally has a more complex PP form which codes two arguments. The
two associated core participants of transitive verbs are the transitive subject (A) and the
transitive object (O). In Nakkara the inclusion and ordering of (A) and (O) marking in the
PP is the subject of intricate morphologicalanalysis, discussed in detail in 5.3,Identification of Core Participants.
With ditransitive verbs, only two of the three participants involved are coded pronominally
within the VC. The subject (A) and the ‘implicated’ (cf. McKay (1975:253)) or secondparticipant (coded as (O)) are identified as core participants. The middle object or theme
(the thing, person or information transferred) is coded outside the VC as an independent
nominal or by the Cardinal (core) pronoun, and never by an Oblique pronoun. The example
following shows a typical ditransitive verb in context.","[183, 184]"

"There are some interesting points to note about about transitive Imperative prefix forms.
First, the object of a transitive Imperative construction is never distinguished for gender;
example (25) below can mean ‘Follow him!"" or ‘Follow her!'. Where gender specification
is required a Cardinal pronoun occurs, following the Imperative verb complex, as in
example (27). Second, the subject of a transitive Imperative is distinguished for gender
only where (A) is Unit-Augmented and (O) is Minimal. Finally, as with transitive indicative
PP forms, number and person specification breaks down where four or more participantsare involved. The two forms /nginba/ and /banba/ cover a range of PP combinations. The
prefix /nginba/ indicates any non-Minimal subject called to act on any first person non-Minimal object and similarly, /banba/ indicates any non-Minimal subject called to act on any
third person non-Minimal object (see gloss, example (29)). This situation of under-specification is even more widespread in the transitive Hortative prefix forms tabled at
5.4.2.2.b. below.","[228, 229]"
"Core constituents can be fully coreferential, non-coreferential or partially coreferential. All
cosubordinate nexes have fully coreferential core constituents, but not all fully coreferential
core constituents exhibit cosubordinate nexus. At this point in the analysis of complex
clauses in Nakkara, there appear to be just two types of clause juncture:the CoreCosubordinate type and the Peripheral Coordinate type. The latter type includes all
combinations of core constituents; that is,.they can have fully coreferential, partiallycoreferentialand non-coreferentialcore constituents. Nevertheless,396the partiallycoreferential constructions (e.g. where the object of one junct is coreferential
with the
subject of the other) display some interesting syntactic devices like purposive and
cause and
effect relations, which are usually coded by nominal case in other language
types. In the
final analysis, the partially coreferential constructions may constitute a separate
subcategory on the non-core level.
The combinations of core constituents tabled below all occur in Nakkara texts. All

"Themajority of affixes arepronominal in form and represent inflectional categories.
Pronominal affixes are characteristic of Nakkara and other prefixing non-Pama Nyungan
languages. Principal grammatical functions are not coded as nominal case affixes, as we
find in the bulk of Australian languages, but as bound pronominal affixes (usually prefixes)
onto a verbal predicate referred to as the verb-complex. Many nominals (a word class
including nouns, adjectives, pronouns and demonstratives) can also be used predicativelyand then occur with pronominal affixes. There are a handful of non-pronominal affixes,
some of which are inflectional and some derivational. They never code grammatical
functions, but add semantic specification, usually locational (see 4.7.).

"Although a transitive verb involves two core participants, (A) and (O), only one is coded
- overtly for some participant combinations. Other combinations identify both (A) and (O)
stems in the prefix. This coding variation depends largely on specific person and numberhierarchies operating in Nakkara. A partial explanation of the operation of hierarchies in
prefix formation is provided by the statement of Ordering Conventions tabled in 5.2.2.above A complete analysis follows
§.3.2.1. (A) ParticipantComponentsin the PPThe simplest transitive PP forms are those involving a participant combination where the
object (O) is third person Minimal non-feminine. This particular component (3M(O)) isrepresented by a zero-morpheme which means that only the (A) participant is overtly coded
in the PP slot. Therefore the paradigm showing the PP forms where (O)= 3M (5.3.2.1.
below) provides a preliminary sketch of (A) stem forms. In that paradigm I have indicated
the stem (in upper case) and affix forms isolated by analysis following.
Notice that in Table 5.3.2.1.a. below, the Minimal PP forms (where overtly coded) are
monosyllabic. These represent all the Minimal (A) stems, although for some Minimal PPcombinations additional explanation is required, see 5.3.2.4. below.",[196]
"LinguisticLANGUAGEAND1ITS SPEAKERSTypeNakkara is the language spoken by the Nakkara people of the central Arnhem Land coast.
Their traditional lands lie between the Liverpool and Blyth Rivers east of the present-day
government settlement of Maningrida. The word ‘nakkara' means ‘this way’ or ‘with/using
this one’, referring to use of the demonstrative pronoun kara ‘this-here’.
Nakkara is a non-Pama Nyungan prefixing language with extensive pronominal crossreferencing coded on verbs and nominals. Nominals are not marked for grammatical case.
This is the first detailed study of the Nakkara language. Bernard Schebeck recorded some
field-notes in the late 1970's and several researchers appear to have collected or referred to
Nakkara words for lexographic research including Capell (1962), (1963), O'Grady,
Voegelinand Voegelin(1966), Oates and Oates (1970)and Wurm(1972). Wurm(1972:114) and Oates and Oates (1970:10) refer to a Nagaran family, with Nakkara
(Nakara)as its only member.",[22]

’ In examples and (34) (a) and (b) above, both Core arguments (1M(A) and 3UA(O)) wouldnot normally occur as independent pronouns outside the VC. The sentences above are both
grammaticalbut (a) in particular is a good example of participant overspecification. Corearguments can precede or follow the VC. Typical independent specification of Core
arguments in simple transitive clauses is either (A) or (O) preceding the VC. The most
commonlyoccurring structure in texts is simply a transitive VC preceded by a non-pronominal (O) NP, as in njonja ngaddjarra (=""fish 1-it-ate"") 'I ate fish’.
Ditransitive verbs are so named because their complementation comprises two elements, a
direct and an indirect object. That is, with the transitive subject included, ditransitive verbsallow three complements and because of this are sometimes termed ""trivalent"" (cf.
Matthews (1981:114). I have recorded only three ditransitive verbs in Nakkara. They arewu 'give', kurakibba ‘take from, deprive' and kuramiya ‘show, point out.
In all ditransitive clause constructions only two of the three arguments are cross-referenced
on the VC. The two participants coded in the VC are the transitive subject as the (A)
element and the indirect object as the (O) element. The direct object or semantic ‘theme’,that is, the object or entity involved in the transfer, is coded outside the VC, either by a
Cardinal pronoun (normally reserved for Core functions) or by a NP. Thus, theoretically, a
ditransitive verb could occur with three Cardinal pronouns in the Core layer of the clause as
in the following example:383(35)Ngarabba ngiyakabba njawuna njeyabba.
ngarabba_ngiyakabba_nja(agent)(theme)2M(O)IMCARD3MfCARD1IM(A)+wu+give-na-PC/Tnjeyabba2M CARD
(recipient/goal)I gave her to you.
In ordinary transitive clauses the goal/recipient would be coded in the outer-core layer of
the clause by an Oblique pronoun. Use of the Oblique pronoun in place of the Cardinal
njeyabba in the example above is unacceptable.

"TransitiveImperativeandHortativeFormsFormation of transitive Imperatives and Hortatives in Nakkara is fairly straightforward,
given the Pronominal Participant Hierarchy applicable to transitive verbs as discussed in
5.2.2. and 5.3.2. There are of course a larger number of transitive prefix combinations,
because a transitive Imperative or Hortative can involve an object as well as a subject, as in
""Wait for me!"", ‘Chase them!', ‘Let's follow her !'.",[227]
"In the remainingexamples,primarystress occurssingle rooton the second rootmorpheme. It is not entirely clear why there should be differing stress patterns at this level.
Nevertheless, it seems likely that in such cases there is a different type of morphologicalrelationship between the compound constituents or perhaps a different word-internal
syntactic structure where the boundaries have become passé. This difference can be
indicated clearly by positing a different type of morpheme boundary and indicating this
with an orthographic convention.
In compounds with three or more root morpheme constituents it is usual for primary word
stress to occur on the second morpheme root in the construction. In some examples,however, primary stress occurs on the first root morpheme.

"242The affix rda-, on the other hand, indicates that the subject participant's motion is directedaway from here (where I am) or away from this place (I speak of).
The affix na- is the more specific of the two orientation specifiers. Like demonstrative
forms nguya(bba) ‘here’ and +kara ‘this one here' the locational aspect of na- is specific
because of reference to a specific entity, namely the speaker. The non-specific locational
nature of ‘there’ (not near speaker) is lexicalized in Nakkara,where four differentdemonstratives stems can answer the question “But where there?"" (see 3.3.3.). Similarly,
direction of motion away from the speaker, coded by rda-, provides less specific
information about the location of the referent. This generality of reference leads, oddly
enough, to restrictions on the occurrence of the affix rda- (outlined below). NPs outside the
verb-complex can always be used to clarify a goal of motion or location of participants.
With intransitive verbs of motion the participant (S) is always the source of a motionaction. Some motion verbs are atelic in the sense that there is potential for the action to be
on-going; the goal need not be specified explicitly, as with verbs like:ya‘go, move, go along’(y)ba‘go, walk, go about'kawaya‘run'karama‘get up and/in order to move’With other verbs of motion there is a supposed end-point or goal somewhere in theof the verb, so they could be termed telic.:

"IVABSTRACT
Chapter 1: In the first chapter I present a brief overview of the Nakkara language and its
speakers. We look firstly at the linguistic type and point out that Nakkara belongs to the
Non-Pama Nyungan family of Australian languages. Some of the salient features of the
language are pointed out and comparisons drawn with other languages in the area.
Alternative names used to refer to this language are listed, followed by descriptions of thetraditional land estates of Nakkara speakers. The remainder of the chapter provides a
backdrop for the language description by outlining relations with traditional neighbours,
involvementwith ceremony,arts and crafts, recent historyand the languageand its. speakers today.
Chapter 2: This chapter describes the phonology of Nakkara and includes phonemic
analysis, stress patterns, phonotactics and word structure, phonological and morphological
rules and orthographic representation. The most detailed area of analysis in this chapter is
the interpretation of an audible stop contrast in the language. Stop length is introduced as asignificant phonetic factor in the phonemic interpetation of Nakkara sounds.
Chapter 3: This chapter is entitled Morphological Preliminaries. It gives a typological
profile of the language and introduces most of the technical terms used in the morphological
analysis of Nakkara. The parts of speech (or word classes) used in this description are alsointroduced here, as well as the morpho-syntactic notions of core, outer-core and peripheral
levels.
Chapter4: The morphology of Nakkara is extensive and is therefore divided into ‘three
separate chapters. In this chapter we examine nominal morphology in general, looking
firstly at independent pronounmorphologythen at pronominalaffixes. Lastlythemorphological functions of non-pronominal affixes and postpositions are introduced.
Chapter 5: This and the following chapter deal with the morphology of verbal structures in
the language. In chapter five the verb-complex (VC) is defined and the morphological
components of the verbal pronominal prefix are analysed extensively. This introduces thenotions of verb transitivity and valency, pronominal participant identification, themorphology of tense, status and polarity distinctions as well as Imperative and Hortative
constuctions.
Chapter 6: This chapter deals with verb-stem morphology in Nakkara. We examine and
categorise verb conjugations and look at the idiosyncrasies of monosyllabic verbs in this
language. Other verb-stem components introduced are the orientation afffixes as well as the
teflexive, reciprocal and inchoative affixes.","[9, 10, 11]"

"1 McKay (1984:119) suggests that a relationship of some equivalence exists between Nakkara, Ndjébbana
and Burarra languages. I agree with him that Nakkara, Ndjébbana
and Burarra might be linked
more distantly
with a Gunwinyguan language family, but suggest that Nakkara and Ndjébbana have some important
features in common (see details in discussion above) that set them apart from Burarra and Gunartpa,
Gungarragoni, Gunbarlang, Rembarmga and Kunwinjku, which may well be the other members of a

"I do suspect that in Nakkara, and perhaps in the other languages spoken in what is now the
Maningrida area, the occurrence of long and short stops was at one time entirely
predictable, much as it is in Maung today. (Maung is the language spoken on Goulburn
Island, just north-west of Maningrida.) Diffusion of different features in mainland
languages has most certainly played a large part in extending and upsetting what may oncehave been a finely balanced combination of phonotactic and perhaps prosodic allophony. Iinclude here the considerable influence of the ""Maccassan"" languages in coastal areas of
Arnhem Land.(See Walker & Zorc (1981)). Maccassarese with its phonemic contrast of
voiced and voiceless stops and its characteristically different stress patterning has, I
suspect, played no small part in muddying the contrast. For these non-synchronic reasons I
lean towards any interpretation that has a single series of stop phonemes as its foundation.
2.4, StopLengthat MorphemeBoundariesIn Nakkara there are significant generalisations to be made about the length of stops at
morpheme boundaries. Firstly, a large percentage of long stops occur at word-internal
morpheme boundaries. Considering the polysynthetic nature of Nakkara words this is an
important point. In fact,a quick count of long stops (excluding those in syllable-finalposition) in a conversational text has shown that in the first two hundred sentences, a
staggering 70% of long stops occurred at morpheme boundaries; only the remaining 30%
were morpheme-medial long stops. In other words, given an understanding of morphemeboundaries in Nakkara, there is a significant degree of predictability of stop length. Indeed,
it is possible to make. three far-reaching generalisations about stop length at morpheme
boundaries.
1. Root-initial stops in word-medial post-vocalic position will always be
long.","[48, 49]"
"The Oblique pronoun occurs most frequently as an ""indirect object"" with verbs (see 8.2.
below). It can, however occur as a benefactive pronoun following nominals, and in thisfunction is similar to the possessive constructions exemplified above in that it forms a
verbless predicate/comment, as in the two examples following:(28)| Nkarabba nawaka ngorlawa.n+karabbanawakangorlawa3M_+this-here

"StressIn Nakkara, stress is not contrastive, and therefore not phonemic. Nevertheless there are
interesting patterns of stress in the language for which it will be necessary to formulate
tules of stress placement in this analysis.
In simple word-forms, the domain of stress in Nakkara is not the word as such but the
morpheme, usually the root morpheme. It makes sense in a language with such a vast array
of prefixes, to distinguish the root of a word with primary stress placement. Verbal and
nominal prefixes and suffixes, although morphemes in their own right are not assigned
primary stress. (Monosyllabic verb-complexes are somewhat of an exception in this regard.
See discussion in 6.2.)
Morphemes are made up of anything from one to seven syllables in data collected so far.
Word-formscollected have up to thirteen syllables, consisting of one or more rootmorphemes plus various affixes. For most words, including morphologically complexwords that have just one root morpheme, it is normal for primary stress to be assigned to
the first syllable of the root morpheme, and accompanying primary stress is noticeablelengthening of the vowel. This generalisation of primary stress assignment applies to over
95% of the data.
Secondary stress normally falls on the penultimate syllable and then on altemating syllables
on the
preceding the penultimate (i.e. in a right-to-left direction), but does not occur
syllable immediately following the one that is assigned primary stress.",[56]
