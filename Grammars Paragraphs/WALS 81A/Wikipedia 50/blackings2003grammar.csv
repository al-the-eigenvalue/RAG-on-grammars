"15paeatIn the differentiation of inflected and uninflected verbs, the 'Burulo
dialect differs in many ways from the Lokai and Ugandan dialects of
Ma'di; for example, in 'Burulo there is no object-verb order difference.
We discuss the inflected, uninflected and directive verbs in separate
chapters. Using the classification proposed by Heine (1976), the Lokai
Madi type of word order is Type B: partly SVO, partly SOV; the 'Burulo
type of word order is type A: SVO.",[31]

"[Lokai]9.7. The form which we call 'directive' is called 'subjunctive' by
Tucker
Tucker (1940: 226) calls what we are calling 'directive' the 'subjunctive'.
He says that it is used in sentences expressing 'permission, compulsion
or doubt'. He comments that it very often follows the auxiliary verbs 6a,
εΒε, de (meaning 'make, let'), and in Ma'di it can follow Ιε ('want').
Tucker comments on the fact that the word order does not seem to match
the pronoun paradigm: the paradigm, including ka in the third person is
like the paradigm for inflected verbs, but the word order is like the word
order for uninflected verbs.
Tucker further suggests that the subjunctive (directive) is used in the
dialect he calls Pandikeri (our 'Burulo) in a narrative to express a
sequence of actions. As evidence he cites a translation of two verses from
the New Testament. W e think this is not correct for the dialect he is
discussing, and arises in his examples as a stylistic use of the directive to
give an effect of high formality in the Biblical translation.",[205]

There is a prefix i- which takes a foreign verb not independently attested
as a loanword in Ma'di and makes a Ma'di verb from it with M*L tone.
Examples include 1mlsì 'miss' from English 'miss', loda 'order' from
English 'order', lätäki 'attack' from English 'attack', and Igâdà 'to have
lunch' from Juba Arabic gâdà 'lunch'. This is quite a productive
process.","[84, 85]"
"Tucker on wàTucker says that wà is attached to the verb in Lokai and separated in
Panderiki (ie. the 'Burulo dialect). We have found no evidence for
attachment to the verb in any dialect. It may be that Tucker is
reinterpreting the fact that Lokai differs from 'Burulo in that it can have
object-verb order, where the verb is capable of being followed
immediately by wà.",[481]

The stem tone is raised in 'Burulo. Thus for example uninflectedpä 'ate'

The low tone prefix on the inflected verb is missing in 'Burulo not
only in these structures but also on subordinate verbs (10.7.1). This
might suggest that there is some similarity between the low tone prefix in
a matrix verb and in an embedded suffixed verb. Subordinate verbs have
no special tonal morphology in the 'Burulo dialect (and have exactly the
same subordinating suffixes as in the Lokai dialect).

"FOC17.4. Negation: ku (nonpast) and küru (past)
'Descriptive negation' with ku or küru is the basic kind of negation,
where the sentence states that something did not happen, is not happening,
or will not happen. Descriptive negation is achieved by placing ku or küru
at the end of the sentence. The negation particles also have focus-related
behaviour, discussed in the focus chapter: icü can be used to contrastively
negate a constituent of the sentence (19.10.2); both kü and küru combine
with η to form freely placed adverbials (19.11). Phonologically kü fits a
general pattern in Nilo-Saharan where a negative word often has the
phonological structure [k]+vowel (Bender 2000: 65).
17.4.1. Negation and tense
In descriptive negation, the verb is always uninflected, never inflected. The
uninflected vs. inflected distinction normally expresses tense on the verb;
in descriptive negation, the tense is expressed instead by the negation
particle. Djuruni (1983: 91) proposes a functional explanation of why
descriptive negation in Logbara takes the 'past tense' syntax, which is
that the past is like negation in that they both involve 'non-presence'.
Some descriptions of Central Sudanic languages propose, in our view
incorrectly, that the distinction between kü and küru or cognates is one of
aspect rather than tense, parallel to a claim made in these descriptions that
object-verb order distinguishes aspect rather than tense (8.4.2.4).
17.4.1.1.ku : nonpast¿¿»combines with an uninflected verb, and expresses nonpast (present or
future) tense. The combination of the uninflected verb with ku appears to
be equivalent to the inflected verb in that it expresses nonpast, eitherNegation: ku(nonpast) and kûrù (past)467habitual, progressive or future.

A deleted pronominal is always interpreted as third person. Thus in order

lPL(EXC)7.2.1.3. The choice between 'short' and 'long' pronominals
The two pronominal paradigms are optional alternatives for one another;
either can be used in uninflected structures. Most speakers seem to agree
that there are no clear functional differences between them; some suggest
that the 'long' pronominal makes the person of the subject more clear, or
emphasizes it, but not all speakers agree. The only systematic exception to
the principle of free variation between them is when the verb begins136The uninflected verblexically with a vowel, where first and second person meanings require the
long subject, as indicated above. The difference can also be seen as
largely a dialectal difference, with Ugandan Ma'di preferring the short
subject (cf. Tucker 1940: 141, 142), and the Lokai Ma'di preferring the
long subject. The terms 'short pronouns'and 'long pronouns' are used
by Tucker and Crazzarola.
7.2.1.4. The derivation of 'long' pronominals
We suggest that 'long' pronominals are derived from the 'short'
pronominals by a syntactic process, along the following lines. All third
person pronouns which are subjects of verbs can optionally be preceded
by lexical subjects, which we refer to as adjoined subjects and which are
coreferential with the subject pronominal; thus àpi is the adjoined subject
in the following sentence, coreferential with the U-paradigm subject
pronominal δ-.
(8)Spiö-sld3¿dìmOpi

The other subject pronominal paradigms show the same possibility of
combination; (9, 10) show this for the I-paradigm subject pronominal

"Inflected, uninflected and directive verbsRoot sentences show distinct kinds of structures, depending on the verb,
which is inflected (1,2), uninflected (3,4) or directive (5,6). The three types
of verb are differentiated by taking different subject pronominals; the
inflected verb is prefixed by a low tone which can appear on the preceding
word's vowel, and is glossed as N-. The inflected verb is used in nonpast
sentences, and the uninflected verb in past sentences. However, if the verb
is negated, only the uninflected verb is used and the choice of negation
particle codes past or nonpast (7,8). The inflected verb is preceded by its
object or takes an object clitic. The uninflected verb (or directive verb) is
followed by its object and the object can be omitted.

Sentences with nonverbal predicates
In this chapter we look at sentences without verbs where the predicate is a
noun phrase, adjective phrase or postposition phrase. Definite and
indefinite noun phrases have different syntactic structures in predication.
We argue that nonverbal predication, like verbal predication involves both
a pronominal subject and optionally also an adjoined subject. We look at
the tense of sentences with nonverbal predication, and conclude with an
examination of the grammatical word drìi.","[233, 234, 235]"

The pronominal subject of an inflected verb is capable of being an

"The subject as the patient of a transitive predicateA transitive verb characteristically assigns its subject the thematic role of
agent and its object the thematic role of patient. It is possible for the
subject instead to be assigned the patient thematic role. The effect is
similar to passive in English, though achieved by different syntactic
means.
5.3.1. Detransitivization (and hence subject interpreted as patient)
All transitive verbs characteristically have objects. If the object is not
realized explicitly as a noun phrase or pronoun, there are two optionsThe subject as the patient of a transitive predicate89depending on the verb. If the verb is uninflected or directive the object can
be covert, while if the transitive verb is inflected the object can only be
realized as ?a and cannot be omitted.
(77)ko-dt-?ara3-N-cook-OBJ AFF
(a) 'It will certainly cook it.' (describing a cooking utensil)
(b) 'She will certainly cook it.'
If a verb which would normally have an object is inflected and ?a is
omitted, this means that the verb is not a transitive verb, which means that
its subject must be interpreted as the patient rather than the agent.
(78)ko-di
3-N-COokra'
AFF'It will certainly get cooked'
(79)ko-di3-N-cook
'It is getting cooked'
If the verb is uninflected, it is in principle ambiguous between a
transitive form with covert object and an intransitive form with no object
and a patient subject, readings (a) and (b) respectively in (80).

Detransitivization is possible for some verbs and not others. Transitive
verbs for which detransitivization is possible include di 'cook' and emi
'boil'. Some verbs appear only in an intransitive form with a patient
subject; these include äka 'melt'. Transitive verbs for which this is not
possible and which therefore always have agent subjects include ρ à 'eat',
mvü 'drink' and djè 'wash'. Causative verbs with the i- prefix cannot be
detransitivized:90(82)VerbsirádìIkóbeerthisfinishra

We say that a post-verbal constituent can 'terminate' the verb if the
sequence of uninflected verb + constituent can constitute the end of a
clause.
The verb's object can terminate the verb. If the object is an indefinite
noun phrase it can be final. Otherwise, the object must be embedded
under focus.",[163]

"543Focus
Focus on subject or objectSubject or object can be focused, using one of four strategies:
the ao strategy
the null strategy
the ?f strategy
the m strategy
The strategies differentiate among arguments by:
(a) Grammatical function: aü and the null strategy are found only with
objects.
(b) Person: ni focuses third person subjects while ?1 focuses first and
second person subjects.
(c) Definiteness: the null strategy is used for final bare indefinites and
the ?ï-strategy for other kinds of final noun phrase.
(d) Wh- vs. non-wh-: ni will normally not focus an object, but will
focus a wh-object in certain circumstances.
(e) Type of verb: the null strategy can be used to focus a final bare
indefinite object of an uninflected verb but not the final bare
indefinite object of a directive verb.
A pronominal argument can be focused. A null object can be focused. A
left-dislocated object (which leaves a pronominal copy behind) can be
focused. A subject or object which is a wh-phrase must be focused, and
can in addition optionally be left-dislocated.

"8.3.2.2. Distribution
The object pronoun ?ä is attached as a postclitic to the inflected verb, and
is often combined with the preceding verb as a single word, with the
glottal stop lost, thus taking the form -a.
The object pronoun ?a is used only in a tensed sentence, and only
when the verb is inflected.

Some subordinate clauses have exactly the syntax of root clauses.

the syntax of root clauses (eg. root verbal morphology) but lack a subject.
(41)opi 5-dntipadìOpi 3-then[foodN-cook](a) 'Opi then cooked food.'
(b) 'Opi will then cook food.'
The function played by subordinating conjunctions in some languages is
played in Ma'di by freely placed adverbials within the subordinate clause;
such adverbials can usually also be found in a root clause, suggesting that
there is no true class of 'subordinating conjunctions'.
Other subordinate clauses have a suffixed verb. The suffixed verb
always has a low tone prefix which is homophonous with the inflected
verb's prefix and may be the same prefix. We assume that it is the same
prefix, and hence gloss it as N-. It is often hidden by phonological
processes. There are several verbal suffixes. One suffix -kä appears to
make the clause into a constituent which has the syntactic distribution of a
noun phrase, and thus prefix perhaps nominalizes the verb.

"8.4.2.4. Inflection as a coding of tense rather than aspect
We treat aspect as secondary, correlating with tense interpretation and not
having any direct morphological manifestation. In this we disagree with
the tradition of analyzing Ma'di (along with other Central Sudanic
languages) as primarily grammaticalizing aspect rather than tense. This
tradition is most influentially stated in Tucker (1940: 71). Tucker notes
that there are two distinct syntaxes for verbs, involving different choices
of subject paradigm and different positions for the object (he does notInterpretation173observe the presence of the low tone inflectional prefix). What we identify
as the uninflected form is described by Tucker as expressing 'complete,
perfect, definite' and what we identify as the inflected form is described
by Tucker as expressing 'incomplete, imperfect, progressive, indefinite'.
Most - perhaps all - subsequent writers on all Central Sudanic languages
accept Tucker's position that the distinction is basically a
grammaticalization of aspect and not a grammaticalization of tense. For
Ma'di, this seems to us to be incorrect; the inflected form is sometimes
imperfective (when present) and sometimes perfective (when future).
Fundamentally what the inflection and correlating aspects of the syntax
codify is that the verb is nonpast. (Progressive past and future are
expressed by other means, as described above.) To some extent this
disagreement relates to how one interprets the relation in principle
between aspect and tense in general linguistic terms, and whether for
example one assumes that as a universal the future is inherently
imperfective, as Lojenga (1994: 246) apparently does in her discussion of
Ngiti.","[188, 189]"
"Options for realization of the subjectIn our view, every root clause whether verbal or nonverbal always has a
pronominal subject. The pronominal subject can optionally be preceded
by a 'subject' noun phrase, which we call the 'adjoined subject' because
it is in a sense 'adjoined' to the true pronominal subject. In the
pronominal paradigm for the uninflected verb (the U-paradigm), the first
or second person pronominal subject can either be 'short', consisting of a
vowel prefix only, or 'long', consisting of the vowel prefix to which a full
independent pronoun is adjoined. There does not appear to be any
significant difference in information structure between the short and long
pronominals. The difference, if anything, is associated with dialectal
tendencies, with some speakers preferring one and some the other form,
though we note that some speakers who use both long and short forms
think the long pronoun is (in their words) more 'emphasized'.
