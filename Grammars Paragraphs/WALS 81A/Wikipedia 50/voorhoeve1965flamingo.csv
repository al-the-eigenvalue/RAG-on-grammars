peripheral part can be deduced by comparing the different forms and from
the discussion on the formal characteristics of the categories which will
be given immediately after the paradigms;

"+WORD-CLASSESThe morphological structure of the coreOnly provisional observations can be made here about the structure
of the core. The reason for this is that the main point of research, as
regards the verb, was an investigation into the verbal categories. An
insight into the structure of the verbal system proved to' be a prerequisite if I were to understand and to speak the Asmat language.
The relative independence of the core made it possible, temporarily
to leave its structure outside consideration. Since, however, research
into the verbal categories took most of the available time, there was
none left for a systematic examination of the cores. This remains one
of the most important tasks for future research.
Consequently, the paragraphs on co-re-structure, as well as the paragraphs on core-morphology, represent only a preliminary reconnaissance
in the field. The picture of the core-structure given here is for the
main part based on indirect information, i.e. information obtained from
an analysis of a specific corpus of verbal cores of which only a small
part was elicited from the informants with this analysis in view. This
corpus of verbal cores consists of 2 3,000 cores, of which Â±1.200
occur in the texts to be appended to this grammatical description.","[54, 55]"
"THE ASMAT LANGUAGEto Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.
8 The terrain, the people, the concept of their worldThe area in which the Kiimoro, Skmpan and Asrnat languages are
spoken consists mainly of a marshy, low-lying, thickly wooded plain,
intersected by countless rivers and streams of which a noteworthy
feature is the ebb and flow of the tide far into the hinterland. The
climate of the region is very humid and the rainfall abundant approximately 225 inches a year. The terrain is very heavy going on
foot, so the canoe is the usual means of transport. I t is used extensively.
One can go everywhere along the natural network of waterways by
canoe and people can thus move about easily and can cover great
distances.
The Asmat people dwell in villages situated along the rivers. The

less than 100. The total Asmat population is estimated to be 40,000
persons. The people of the central Asmat region call themselves &mat
ow.which probably means 'tree peoplej.4
According to the Asrnat people, the territory they inhabit, the b a t
capmmi, is enclosed within, and lies at the bottom of, a gigantic
coconut: their world is not convex but concave.5 The boundaries of
their world correspond roughly to those of their language-area between the Casuarinen Coast and the Mimika Coast (where Kimoro
is spoken). And one can do' the 'journey round the world' by setting
out from the Casuarinen Coast, crossing the stretch of water between
it and the Mimika Coast, landing there, and then returning to the
Casuarinen Coast. Through the middle of this world flows the great
River Sirkc, rising far away, somewhere at the top of the coconut,
close to the holy entrance to the upper world (the outside world).
From this opening, in prehistoric times, the heavenly beings descended
to earth, in order to populate the world with their descendants.

"INTRODUCTION7where the investigation was later to be carried on. Mifekpic had even
spent part of his childhood there.
My relationship to the two boys developed from the outset on the
'anak piara' 12 pattern: they called me their 'father' and were regarded
as my 'children'. They were paid in cash for their assistance. They
were given a meal every day, and now and then some clothes and
tobacco. With their wages they could buy clothes, tobacco, and the
highly prized axes and chopping knives at the shop in Agats. The
relationship with these informants was a very good and personal one
throughout the whole undertaking. They worked with enthusiasm and
pleasure, apart from some unavoidable lapses.
Because the boys were still rather young, their knowledge of their
mother tongue, of tradition and of mythology was sometimes inadequate
for the translating of the folk tales I collected. The help of an older
man was then enlisted for the interpretation of mythological matters
and special usage. In addition, all the Asinat people with whom I conversed acted as informants. The information received from them was
always checked again with the regular informants.
The reason I chose two of the latter was primarily to enable me to
control the information given by the one by that provided by the other
and vice versa. Another reason was that the boys' capacity for work
was rather small, especially in the beginning - an hour at a stretch
was more than enough for them. Later, when they had been properly
trained, they could sustain a session of two hours or longer without
difficulty. No fixed scheme of questioning was followed at these
sessions. The discussion began on a particular subject and developed
as it went along, depending upon the mood of the informant. The boys
were never prevented from giving information spontaneously, even if
it were not relevant, but sometimes they had to be guided along a fresh
track back to the original subiect. If it became apparent that an answer
to a question about a particular matter was not forthcoming readily,
either because the boy did not understand me, or because he had had
enough, then it was put on one side. Later, a casual return to it often
produced good results. If one of them gave information on a subject
and it differed from that which the other had furnished, then these
variations were discussed in the presence of both of them. And sometimes it then became clear that they held differing opinions regarding
the pronunciation of particular wolrds, or their meaning.
12 The Indonesian word for foster-child,THE ASMAT LANGUAGE7 Tape recordingA portable tape recorder was used extensively for the collecting
of the language data and the music. Thus texts and music could always
be got without difficulty. Only once was I requested not to record
a sacred song. The Asmat people were delighted to hear their own
music reproduced. Western music meant nothing to them. They were
not much interested in the texts, though this did not alter the fact that
the audience always listened critically and expressed their disapproval
in a very positive fashion of any deviations from the version they knew.
The analysis of the texts collected appeared to be of great value for
an understanding of the language and it was through these that I came
upon the track of the special forms of the Asmat verb which express
varying moods.
The language of the folk tales would not appear to differ from
common usage. Asmat songs, however, have their own vocabulary
which is known only to the older people, particularly the singers.
These latter were, however, less inclined to be con~municativeabout
it to strangers.
8 Research in Ag-ats and JepemI began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Government and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight asINTRODUCTION9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"

238I shall now deal with a number of words that have no rnorpho'logical
valence and which cannot yet be classified into a definite word-class
because the material is insufficient for this purpose. That I have,
nevertheless, divided them into negations and postpositions is due to
the fact that the negations, at least, have a feature common to them,
one which is not found in the postpositions : only specific forms of the
verb can occur before negations. The feature characteristic of the
postpositions is that they always occur at or within the end of a
word-group.43
The syntactical valence of the negations and postpositions, like that
of the interrogatives, is still not fully known to me. In so far as I have
been able to determine it with certainty will it be mentioned, and
examples will be given.
In additioln, cases will also be given of the occurrence of negations and
postpositions in sentences of which the syntactical structure has not
yet been determined.
The negations and postpositions will be dealt with in the following
order :11. The postpositions: on the basis of their function, these can be
divided into :
1. emphasizing words : arhÂ¥wnat, man
2. conjunctions : am, win, enerim/edm,
44
3. question markers : en/an, open/pen, am1
4. the dubitative marker : ew
5. the irrealis marker : a j
The only exception to this is en$rIwl/e~/ti~
which is always placed between
proper names.
44 There are still three other conjunctions : rn~.vi~zcrimfwiasnerim/maserittz/
mi.sZrtnz/masnim then; w&
again; mariw,/mar&w/Â¥~nart/ntar
- at last,
finally. These link word-groups with word-groups. These words will not be
discussed here because this is not possible without a previous investigation
into the syntax.","[175, 176]"
"The following terms are used:singular ; plural.
subject, = verbal subject; object, = verbal object.
aquatic, lying, sitting, standing, above eye level: these terms refer to
the five polsition-classes as discussed in 5 71, note. Aquatic and above
eye level are preferred here to swin1ning and flying. Thus e.g, 'aquatic
subject' means : the subject of the verb belongs to the aquatic class
of things.",[304]
"43WORD-CLASSES6. the subjectivity marker: uw
7. the quotative marker : in/w/n.
Lastly, I will discuss three elements of which the function is still not
clear to me: m/un/un/d, am3, and aw.
NegationsOnly the following forms of the verb can precede negations :
1. the m-/mV- and the m-/mV-@ forms :
2. the tense and tense-aspect categories of verbs of which the core
contains the formative por == to wish, to try to. These verbal forms
only occur in combination with @k/pak, opO~s.l/powand @nakdw/
pZnakhw. These negations then express a contrariness which can be
translated by : but no, but in vain.opdk/paknot, withoutufidk and pak alternate freely, except after verbs with the formative
for, where opik always occurs. pak was usually found after the m-/mVand the m-/wtV-dji forms of the verb; in other cases op6k was usually
found.opdk/pak can form groups with :
the m-fmV- forms of the verb: m@or pdk embf

""manic"" ajipor opdk eat it, he said, but in vain.
/eat it / he said/ notopow/pownot, withoutThe distribution of o
m and pow is parallel to that of opdk and pak.
I could not find a distinct difference in meaning between o$hk/pak and
o p h / p o w . I got the impression from the examples to hand that the
relationship between opdk/pak and opow/pow is parallel to that
between the non-mood and the mood forms of the verb. opow/pow
was only found in direct speech, in sentences in which the speaker
gives expression to varying moods.
op6w/pow was found linked to :
the m-/mV- forms of the verb:

"I t was only in the recent past that the Asrnat region was brought
tinder control - the area was notorious for head-hunting-. Only in 1954
did the Government finally s'et up its seat there, at Agats, though the
Roman Catholic Mission had opened its first Mission station there
in, 1953. It was also at Agats that the Protestant Mission (The
Evangelical Alliance Mission, TEAM for short) began its activities
in this region in 1955.6
I t is my opinion that, from the diachronical point of view, the word bsmat,
or h o t , is possibly a compound formed with the word for 'tree', now os,
and a generic element, now amof, m o t , which is found in compounds like
ser-amot - ser fish (species of), and probably also in the word setmot, set
bird (species of), the name of one of the ceremonial houses (Jew) of Surh.
The name Asmat would then be consistent with a tradition that the people
sprang from trees,
I have to thank D. E. Eyde for this information which he came upon by
chance. It is noteworthy, that a concept of the world common to all the
Asmat people, which is not sacred and is spoken of openly, has for so long
escaped the attention of European investigators.

with the outside world, and olf the establishment of Government, the Roman
Catholic Mission and the Protestant Mission in these regions in: V. F. P. M.

the Asrnat people, as in so many regions in New Guinea, was first
undertaken by the Roman Catholic and Protestant Missions. The
Dutch Missionary, P. Drabbe, who lived in Agats from 1957 to 1959,
made a study of the dialect of the village of Ajam, 20 miles further
upstream. I n addition, he collected material on various other dialects.
His grammar of the Ajkm dialect, with a vocabulary, as well as a
comparative study of three Asmat dialects, have been published.7

and Mrs. Dresser, the wife of the TEAM doctor at Pirimaphn, Cook
Bay is making an initial study of the Asmat of the Casuarinen Coast.
To date, their work has not been published.
4 Present research, choice of dialectThe following description of the language is the result of an investigation into the coastal dialect around Flamingo Bay which was
carried out from November, 1960, to September, 1962, under the
auspices of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea
(W.O.N.G.).s
The aim of this research was the collecting of material for a description of one of the Asmat dialects. Outside Mission circles in New
Guinea, almost nothing was known about Asmat. Drabbe's grammar
of the Ajkm dialect had been published, though this fact was not
known to me until I arrived in the area, and found that the Mission
disposed over a few copies of it. The only thing on Asmat I had had
at my disposal was a short vocabulary at the end of Drabbe's KAmoro
grammar. Thus a preliminary orientation into the language was not
possible. The investigation had to be started from scratch,

a r h always occurs before the postpositions a d e n , in/un/n, and man.
ard
always occurs before the negation pak, and before new ($ 255).
ar145 always occurs before the postposition am2.
ardw/ard/ar' can be used to make a statement about an existing

"WORD-MORPHOLOGYIntroductionIn this section the verbal forms which can be formed from the core
by the addition of prefixes and suffixes will be dealt with. These verbal
forms, together with the affixless cores, make up the system of verbal
categories. This system consists of 24 main categories 17 of which each
consist of a system of sub-categories. A survey of these 24 main
categories is given in the scheme on p. 68; the sub-categories are
here omitted.
The form of the scheme is determined by the following considerations :1. that the verbal cores are distinguished from all other verbal forms
by the absence of a categorial element of form. They can be saidWORD-CLASSES69to form a non-characterised category as opposed to1 to all other
categories, which are characterised.
I n the scheme: I and 11.
2. that the characterized categories fall into :
1. categories in which there are no sub-categories.
2. one in which there is a division into a number of object-categories; the verbal forms belonging to this category differ from
each other in the suffix indicating the object, e.g.,mo-por-c.&
look at me !
mo-por-c.aw@ look at us!3. one in which there is a division into a number of subjectcategories; the verbal forms belonging to this category differ from
each other in the suffix indicating the subject, e.g.,d-por-c.Ow
&por-c.ow&jdo1 look ! (sing.)
do look ! (plur.)4. a number of categories in which there is a division into a
number of subject categories and a number of object categories;
the forms belonging to these categories differ from each other in
the suffix indicating the subject and the suffix indicating- the
object, e.g.,~-p-m.i I see him
a-por-m.4~ yotu see him
6-por-tn.2n.k you see me (Cat. 14)In the scheme: 11, 1, 2, 3, 4.
Cutting across the preceding"" division of four groups of characterized
categories, there is a division of a totally different kind, i.e., the
division of the characterized categories into :
A. A number of categories that occur with all cores.
B. A number of categories that do not occur with cores ending in
time-of -day formatives, i .e., itum/ntum, es3 it/ut, or the durative
formative, aw&/awdr/ewir/a.
C. One category that occurs only with cores ending in the durative
formative, a-wdr/awh-/ewir/a.

"THE ASMAT LANGUAGE3 The -a category109When -a is suffixed to cores, a category is formed with a semantic
element of repetition. In most cases the suffix -a was found to' be
accented.

in meaning was found between the forms with and without a-:i so bkom-d, ~ r u m d cam taw-&,/imm cowdk, / in&cowdk/e song /to start repeatedly/ lament also /to sing repeatedly / and so on/

The forms of this category can be linked with forms of the verb e/j

4 The m'/mV- category
110m- is prefixed to cores beginning with a vowel ;
mV- is prefixed to cores with initial consonant. The vowel of the
prefix is identical to the first vowel of the core, but it can also be a
irrespective of the following vowel. A definite regularity could not be
found here ; sometimes both possibilities were found alongside each
other, sometimes only one of them, for instance, I noted:
from f o r 'to see' : xa6-por and md-for;
from fis 'to come inside' : always mi-fis ;
from ni 'to return home7: always md-n-i.

is translatable with :1. to wish to, in order to, to intend to :WORD-CLASSESno amds m - a w h I am going to scrape out sago.

126Modal suffixes : -c ; -er/-Zr/zero.15
-c occurs with the formal forms.
The following occur with the informal forms :
-er before C
-Zr before V ; after the core-final r, zero always occurs.
Object suffixes ; peculiarities :
111. in forms 6/8 zero occurs instead of -aw.
Subject suffixes ; peculiarities :
3rd. pers. s. in forms 6 / 8 : -aw occurs instead of zero.
3rd. pers. pi.: a feature occurs here which is also found in the
following categories: when combined with the subject suffix -ex of the
3rd. pers. pi., the object suffix -en only relates to the speaker and the
person spoken to:
tetdm-chh if they give me, you (sing.).
If the object-suffix relates to1 the persons spoken to, then the subject
suffix of the 3rd. pers. pi. is zero and the form is like that of form Not, 7 :
fetch-cen a. if he gives it to me, you, you (pi.)
b. if they give it to youPrefixes
A. zero, a-:
a- was only found before cores having one vowel and beginning with
a consonant. An exception is the core fewer to take, of which forms
were found with and without prefix a-.
15For reasons unknown to me the informants always used the informal forms
with cores ending in es, it and awir, and the formal forms with cores ending
in ifdm :kdrtu at& Lit-Zri, i.es-Eri, b.awer-i, e.it&m-ci

upriver scraped out sago all night long. And also Taweric - Atiripic

"INTRODUCTION5the lingua f m c a of West New Guinea. I t was therefore obvious that
the thing to do in this situation was to use Malay as the contact
language and to make use of bilingual informants - Asrnat Papuans
who had acquired a reasonable knowledge of Malay in school.
On arrival in the area, it became clear that the number of Asrnat
Papuans with such a knowledge of Malay was meagre. These potential
informants belonged almost entirely to the younger generation children who had attended the three-year lower school of the Mission
at the Government Station at Agats, or who had left it. Only a few
of the ollder men knew some Malay. The children who went to school
in Agats came from the neighbouring village of Sur~?,and from Ajkrn.
The language of the village of Ajirn, already examined by Drabbe,
belonged to a dialect different from that of the coastal villages, one
of which was Surh, in the environs of Agats, and I therefore decided
to make the dialect spoken at Surh the object of the investigation.
5 The Flamingo Bay dialect: area, historyThe Flamingo Bay dialect is spoken by about 2,600 people who
live in five villages, Ewer, Surii, Jepkm, Per and Uwhs,9 situated in
the immediate vicinity of flamingo^ Bay. In the literature on Asniat,
this group of villages is also called BismAni, but the people themselves
apply this name only to the villages of Ewer and Surt?, of which the
inhabitants formerly lived together.
The oral historical tradition of these villages goes back about a
century. About the middle of the 19th century, Ewer, Sure, Uwhs,
and the village of Majit, stood together on the River Mow: Uwus
is still there (see map). Jepkm and Per, situated on the Jom6t and
the M a d , respectively, were then on the upper reaches of these small
streams, with, at that time, the village of Kajk standing beside Per.
Later on, Majit affiliated with Surii, while Kajk ceased to exist,
According to the data furnished by the Medical Service for 1961, published
in V. F. P. M. van Amelsvoort's thesis (see note 9, p. 192, the population of
these villages at that time was :

verb was only found with, forms of
the categories 10, 12-17 inclusive, 20, 21, 22 and 24 ;
4. only the forms of categories 4 and 5 (m-/mV-; m-/mV- -diji) can

"48THE ASMAT LANGUAGEThe difference in meaning between roots with and without this
formative seems to be that the roots without em/om- mean: 'to be'
or 'to move5, of a subject which belongs to the 'lying', 'standing',
'flying' or 'swimming' class of things,l whereas the roots with
em/um- denote the actual action of lying, sitting, etc.
The roots with em/om- have, moreover, an inchoative element of
meaning : they can mean : to lie down, to sit down, etc.

In general, it can be said that anything that is tall and slender 'stands' (e.g.
trees, upright poles, and men) ; anything that is about as high as it is broad
'sits' (e.g. houses, carrying bags, and also women) : anything that is much
broader than it is high, or is low to the ground, 'lies' (fallen trees, smallanimals, reptiles, the just-risen sun or moon). The fourth class contains
anything in or on the water (e.g. canoes, fishes, and also rivers) ; the fifth
class contains anything that is above eye-level (e.g. flying animals, hanging
objects, objects stored away on the rafters of the house).","[59, 60]"
"54THE ASMAT LANGUAGE85In addition, there are a number of cases in which the value of this
formative is not clear to me; such as in:
&.ta.m, having apparently the same meaning as the underlying
form ni.taj 'to return and reach', in:

a word belonging to another word-class is transposed to the word-class
of the verb. These cases are :

"B. Processes occurring exceptionally :
5. infixation : was only found to occur instead of prefixation within
the core of the verb in three cases (8 76).
6. infixation, simultaneous with suffixation: was only found to
occur instead of suffixation within the core of the verb in three
cases ($ 82).
7. modification : was only found instead of prefixation in one
case ($ 76).
8. multiplication: only two cases were noted : one of triplication
of an adjective ($ 200) and one of quadruplication of a verbal
root ($ 79).
II T H E VERBIntroduction
63From the preceding survey of the morphological processes, it is42THE ASMAT LANGUAGEclear that the word-class of the verb is distinguished from the other
word-classes by the fact that all these processes occur within it, whereas
outside the word-class of the verb only suffixation and composition
occur.
Of the morphological processes which occur only within the wordclass of the verb, only prefixation can occur with all verbs, and
therefore, is characteristic of the verb as a whole: an Asmat verb could
be defined as a word which is, or can be, prefixed.
The mo~rphologicalstructure of the verb which is often very complicated, in comparison to the structure of non-verbs, makes it necessary to divide the description of the verb into three parts:1. a general survey of the morphological structure of verbal forms
and of the relation between the core-morphology and the wordmorphology of the verb ;
2. the core-morphology ;3. the word-morphology.
General survey of the structure of verbal formsCore and peripheral part
64Within the verb, two parts can be distinbuished which are to a certain
degree independent of each other, namely :1. a central part, which will be termed the core of the verb ;
2. a peripheral part.
The verbal core can be monomorphematic or polymqhematic. The
peripheral part consists of prefixes and/or suffixes added to the core.
The mutual independence of the core and the peripheral part shows
itself in a difference in internal organization which makes a separate
description of the two parts necessary.
Their mutual dependence shows itself in the fact that: a. a verb
consists either of a core, or of a core
peripheral part, but never of
a peripheral part alone; and b. there are a number of verbal categories
that do not occur with cores ending with the morphemes iturn, es, it
or u w e ~(see 5s 91-94).","[53, 54]"

"PART IINTRODUCTION1 The Asmat language: area, adjacent languages, dialectsThe language of the Asmat Papuans, Asmat,l is one of a number
of related Papuan languages which are spoken over an extensive area
of the coastal plain of South-West New Guinea (Irian Barat). These
languages extend along the coast from the River Opa in the nolrth-west
to the mouth of the River Digul in the south-east.2
The Asmat region is generally considered to be the coastal strip
and the adjacent hinterland between the Rivers Momkc (Le Cocq
d'Armandville) and Ewtii. In addition to his region, however, Asmat
is also spoken in a small area to the east of the confluence of the Rivers
Sirkc (Eilanden) and Wildeman; on the coastal strip between the
Ewtk and Cook Bay (the Casuarinen Coast) ; and in a few villages
on the coast between Cook Bay and the mouth of the River Digul.
I t is still not known with certainty how far inland the Asmat
language-area extends. I t was only recently that this coastal area was
brought under Government control and that part of the low-lying
plain abutting onto the mountainous country in the centre is still
practically terra incognita. Up to now, Asmat villages have been
encountered inland to a distance of more than 70 miles.
To the north-west of the Asmat language-area, two languages related
