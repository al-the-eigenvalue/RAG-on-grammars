Most lexemes have low semantic density. In terms of exponence, typically
only one or two categories are encoded in a single morpheme. Subject or
object are always combined with number. The multipart progressive (§7.4.2)
includes a deictic distinction in the realis form (§7.4.2). As part of the
progressive, and other constructions, nominalisation and subject marking
are fused into portmanteau morphs (§16.5.1.1). On nominals, the genitive is
combined with number (4.8.5).
Like many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea, the basic word
order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V (Dryer, 2007b, 2011) or simply
verb-final (Foley, 1986, p10). In Momu, all participants in a clause typically
occur before the verb and observe a fixed ordering (§8.1.3).35 Nominal heads
are post-modified (§5.1) excepting nouns modifying other nouns (§14.1.2),
adpositions are postpositive (§3.5.1, §9.1) and relational and adnominal case
marking is post-positive, upon dependents (§4.8.1). This is in line with
the general expectation for S(O)V languages. Possession is variably marked
(§4.8.5): small closed nominal classes include genitive- (pronouns, §3.5.2) or
possessive-marking (possessed kin, §4.6.2). Genitive phrases can freely occur
before or after the head that they modify (§4.8.5.2). Inalienable possession
(relating to body parts and houses) can be unmarked (§14.1.2.4), and is often
externally possessed (§10.2.1).
In “tight” verb or verb phrase coordination (i.e., serial verb constructions,
§13), the final verb is usually the prominent host of inflectional categories.
In looser coordinative structures, each predicating verb may host inflectional
categories. Manner is most commonly indicated by serial verbs (§13.2.1), but
small sets of adverbial forms also occur in a similar (preverbal) position in
the clause (§9.4, §9.3.1, §9.3.1).
All adverbial subordinators occur on the right edge of the clause (§15),
some both pre-modify and post-modify main clauses (often with a diﬀerence in meaning), while others are fixed on one or the other order. Nominal
modifying subordinate clauses occur in the same position as other lexical
modifiers, after the head (§15.1, §15.8). Complementisers also occur after
the dependent clause (§16.2). Depending on the complement-taking predic35Verb-final order is not strictly so, like in languages like Ku Waru (Merlan and Rumsey,
1991). There is a (seemingly increasingly common) pattern of postposing a single nonsubject participant after the verb which should not be considered topical afterthought
(§8.1.3). Certainly though, the dominant word order is clearly S(O)V.","[55, 56]"

"4.8.2Oblique =mAny or all object and oblique arguments can be marked by the oblique.
The marking indicates that the NP functions as a non-subject argument.
Oblique-marking may be required, optional, or impossible according to the
situation. A combination of word order, oblique-marking and predicate type
is used to define both objects (§8.2.2) and obliques (§8.2.3). Adjuncts cannot
be marked oblique.28 The oblique can also mark sentential complements to
a variety of complement-taking predicates (§16).
A secondary function of the oblique by way of its optionality is as a
marker of new information. Non-subject arguments in a clause that are
clearly active in the discourse are often expressed by zero anaphora. Referents whose role in the clause is understood from context may be expressed
by an NP, unmarked for the oblique, as a case of topical reactivation (Lambrecht, 1996). Referents new to the discourse or unrecoverable from context,
or those for whom the speaker deems to be of an unclear role must be marked
oblique.
So, for instance, both the question word and the answer that fills the
same slot in a question-answer pair in (4.18) are necessarily marked with
the oblique. In the question and answer, oblique-marking is required. The
constituent question form is, by definition, a request for an unknown referent.
The response is a new referent (or role for that referent) to the hearer.
Admittedly, this could also be driven by dialogic parallelism that creates the
expectation that the response form should structurally mirror the question
(Evans, 2012).

"32710.1.1Monovalent clausesNearly all intransitive predicates have a subject and a predicate. Subjects
do not take oblique marking, and they occur clause-initially (§8.2.1).
Non-verbally predicated clauses include proper-inclusion (§11.2.1), similarity (§11.2.2), attribution (§11.3, §11.5), possession (§11.4, §11.5), location
(§11.6), and some further minor types (§11.7, §11.8). Amongst these predicates are single lexical items, phrases, and predicates that include predicate
complements. Further details are given in §11, including a consideration
of the non-verbal and verbal coding of some semantic types of predicate in
§11.12. Otherwise, this section is mainly concerned with verbal predication.
Some basic monovalent clauses are given in (10.1). Note that the state
(§7.5.1.1) and achievement (§7.5.1.3) verbs in (a) and (b) are fixed on a third
person singular subject form of the verb, but the nominal can be plural. A
subset of state (§7.5.1.1) and achievement/accomplishment (§7.5.1.3) verbs
have this restriction in subject marking (§3.1.1.2, §3.1.1.3, §8.2.1). Subjects
are otherwise also cross-referenced on the verb. (c) is an example of a monovalent activity verb (with subject marking).

predicate or an oblique with an intransitive predicate. Also possible are
some predicates which take predicate complements.2 The negative possessive
2Predicates that take predicate complements include: the similarity predicate sukw
‘be similar to’ (§11.2.2), or its inchoative verbal form sukta, and copulative uses of the
existential verbs ai ‘be (animate)’ and wu ‘be (inanimate).’ For these predicates, the
predicate complement cannot be expressed by zero anaphora. Note also that the copulas328predicate momu (§11.10) is the only non-verbal transitive predicate. The
remaining predicates are verbs, which is the focus of this section.
Some basic examples of intransitive bivalent clauses are given in (10.2).
All include subjects (8.2.1), obliques (§8.2.3) and verbal predicates, in that
order. Obliques are marked by either the oblique (a), directional (b), or
comitative relational cases (c), or by spatial postpositions (d).

and (c) object cross-referencing (§6.2.2). Note also that the oblique case is
used for both objects and obliques.

"3.2NominalsNominals in Momu head noun phrases (§5) but also sometimes clauses (§11).
The bulk of the class is occupied by the large open subclass of nouns, with
criteria given below. Amongst nominal subclasses are forms that can additionally modify nominal heads (§3.3). For instance, Momu is a language
where adjectives (§3.3.1) function both as modifiers of nominals and as heads
(both phrasal (§5.2) and clausal (§11.3)).
Nominals can function as the head of NPs (§5), and as such may be modified by one of several modifiers (§3.3), for instance in (3.15a) an adjective,
in (b) a demonstrative (§3.5.4) or in (c) a relative clause (§15.1). As shown
in (3.15), modifiers follow the nominal head.

Almost all nominal modifiers can in turn function as the head of an NP
(§5.2), and these, in turn, can be modified by a subset of modifiers. There
is a preferential hierarchy of modifiers such that the lower the head in the
hierarchy, the fewer the choices in modification (§3.3).

As shown above in (c) and (d), nominals can also function as predicates
(§11).
Non-subject arguments can be inflected for oblique case (§4.8.2). Marking is phrase-final (Bickel and Nichols, 2007). Noun phrases are head-initial,
and so this is a dependent marking language (Nichols, 1986).

Similarly case marking with the comitative =b combines with word order to
indicate a coordinated subject (§4.8.3.1, §14.2.2), or instrumental obliques
(§4.8.3.2).17 The focus marker =ne (§4.8.9) indicates that an argument is
extra-clausal (contrastively focussed).

Comitative-marking does not occur with objects (§8.2.2). Additionally, comitativemarking occurs on temporal adverbials (§4.8.3.3).","[127, 128]"
"3.1VerbsPredicate heads to a clause in Momu can be either verbal (§10) or non-verbal
(§11). These predicates license one, two or three arguments.1 As the clausal
head, the “neutral” word order typically places the head in the clause-final
position, setting aside factors like discourse pragmatic restructuring of a
clause (Dryer, 2007b).

identified by their ability to inflect for a range of categories including subject

modify a head noun, marking it as possessed.

an improper kin noun, in (b) an abstract noun, in (c) a body part and in (d)
a location. Although some possessive constructions are restricted to certain
nominal word classes, genitive pronouns can modify all nominals (§5.6).

it is preceded by an adjective. In (c) it is preceded by a representative

order of elements is mostly the same as that defined in the basic noun phrase
template (§5.1) but the further to the right that the modifier occurs in the
template, the fewer the modifying possibilities. Phrase structure rules expressing modifier-nominal headed NPs are given in (5.17). Note in particular
that in noun-headed phrases the order of numerals and quantifiers is strict,
but for NPs headed by numerals or quantifiers, each can modify the other.

NP ! QUANT (NUM) (DET)Given their role in restricting reference (Andrews, 2007, p207), a relative
clause cannot be embedded in this modifier-nominal NP type. A “headless”
relative clause can itself stand alone as an NP, however (§15.1.1).
Some examples of modifier-nominal headed NPs are given below in (5.18)
through (5.20). In all these examples, the relevant NP is in bold.
In (5.18) there are examples of NPs headed by an adjective. In (a) the

"25glides. Mid-high vowels are pulled higher by a neighbouring glide (§2.1.4.2),
resulting in a diphthong or phonetic long high vowel. There are no noncomplex high vowels in Momu.
The glides are fragile. In the absence of an adjacent vowel, they are either
devoiced or deleted. Glides aﬀect the surface realisation of both consonants
and vowels (§2.1.3) by palatalising or labialising consonants and raising or
rounding vowels. Glides occupy a special position in the phonotactics of
Momu as well. The ideal basic syllable (§2.4) has a preferred linear ordering of consonant-glide-vowel. In some combinations of morphology where a
final glide meets an initial consonant, this preference triggers metathesis to
generate the preferred ordering of segments (§2.5.1.1). More generally, nonmeaningful metathesis of consonants is a reasonably common occurrence in
Momu, so much so that it initially obscured a genetic aﬃliation with Baibai
(§1.1.1).
Momu is somewhat analytic, with concatenative morphology mostly occurring in the domain of verbs (§6).29 There is a single nonlinear formative
indicating third person singular subjects via ablaut: a rounding operation
of the right edge of a stem (§2.5.1.3). This leads to phonologically driven
syncretism when there is no suitable candidate for rounding,30 as first person singular subjects are the unmarked form of verbs (i.e., zero-marked).
Multiple morphological processes form verbs (§6.3). Diﬀerent sets contain
diﬀerent patterns of syncretism (§6.4). Some transitive verb-forming sets incorporate object marking (§6.3.3.1) and some form transitive verbs without
object marking (§6.3.3.2, §6.3.3.3). Although verb formation is common,
there are also many monomorphemic verbs (i.e., free roots).
Word forming strategies create verbs with selectional properties that pattern on an absolutive basis (i.e., the aﬀected participant). Reasonably common amongst verbs is a pattern of stem alternation such that two diﬀerent
verbs select for the number of an argument along absolutive lines (i.e., verbal
number, §6.6).31 In fact, the ratio of verbal number pairs to other verbs in
29The average verb is very commonly unmarked (usually indicating first singular subject
and perfective categories), but most commonly will be marked for subject cross-reference,
aspectual and or modal categories via a single morpheme in a single slot for each of these
three.
30
Syncretism of first and third person singular subjects is essentially driven by the lack
of a rounding candidate on consonant-final roots. In glossing, these are readily identifiable
in examples throughout this thesis as they have an inferred gloss of “either first or third
person singular subject” ([1|3sgS]).
31
In grammar writing, this pattern is very commonly referred to as “suppletive number”26Momu exists at the upper end of what is typologically evident at this point
in time (Corbett, 2000). As such, most commonly the stems are regularly
derived (§6.5, §6.6.2.3), while a minority are represented by completely diﬀerent (§6.6.2.1) or partially recognisable forms (§6.6.2.1). Some word-forming
“aspectual suﬃxes” (§7.5.2) also pattern on an absolutive basis. A directional
suﬃx indicates the location or path of an aﬀected participant (§7.5.2.1), and
the incompletive suﬃx indicates the state of completeness of the aﬀected
participant (§7.5.2.4).32
Momu has large open classes of verbs and nominals, with small closed
subclasses within them. Nominals have minimal inflectional categories, mostly
of the dependent marking kind (§4.8), outside of small closed classes like
pronouns (§3.5.2), or possessed kin terms (§4.6.2). The verbs are really the
powerhouse of the language, especially in the context of extremely common
elision of topical referents. As such, it is not uncommon for clauses to almost
entirely consist of sequences of verbs (§13).
Momu has a nominative-accusative system of agreement. A basic relational case system diﬀerentiates subjects from non-subject arguments via
an oblique case marker, which also marks most other kinds of non-subject
(§4.8.2, §8.1.2). Subjects are nearly always cross-indexed on verbs (§6.2.1,
§8.2.1), objects less so (§8.2.2).33 Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal,
with many intransitive predicates coded by non-verbal forms (§11). Transitive predicates are almost exclusively coded by verbs. There is a single pair
of ditransitive verbs: no/tu ‘give one/many’ (§3.1.2.3). Momu employs existential verbs as copulas (§11.12.3) and only in this very restricted case does
one find irregular word orders, and a diﬀerently coded subject (§8.2.1).34
Considering the other inflectional categories of verbs, Momu possesses a
classic viewpoint aspect system of the kind where perfectives are unmarked
(§7.2) and imperfectives are marked (§7.3). Modal categories are suﬃxed on
verbs (§12.1.1), and there also exists a small set of “modal predicates”, the
majority of which concern epistemic stance (§12.1.2). Negation is marked on
clauses via a final particle (§12.2.1) or typologically uncommon complementor “number suppletion”. For the reasons I lay out in §6.6, I will not be continuing this
tradition here.
32
Aspectual suﬃxes are primarily concerned with the internal structure of the event.
33
Variation in the treatment of objects is both common and clear enough in Momu to
be treated as a split (8.2.2).
34
The split in the coding of subjects is not significant enough to justify labelling it as a
“split subject”, however.","[53, 54, 55]"

"6.2Cross-indexationHaspelmath (2013) has proposed a well-ordered set of terminologies to describe bound person forms. He is motivated by the lack of precision in traditional labels such as “agreement”, which carry with them analytical assumptions that I too wish to avoid. Haspelmath makes a three-way distinction
by combining variation of bound person markers (“indexes”) and optional,
absent or obligatory co-referential nominals (“conominals”). Indexes in combination with optional conominals are “cross-indexes”; indexes with obligatory conominals are “gramm-indexes”; and indexes without conominals are
“pro-indexes”. The most common type cross-linguistically are cross-indexes.
182In Haspelmath’s terms, Momu is a language with subject and object
cross-indexation of conominals. Within the framework, the term “crossindex” implies that conominals are optional.1 A simplified version of Momu
cross-indexes is given in Table 6.1, to plot the necessary distinctions. Object
cross-indexation in this table is abstractly represented, as the full form of
the verb-forming suﬃxes are not shown (§6.2.2.1, §6.3.3.1).

Subject cross-indexes (§6.2.1) make finer distinctions in number than object cross-indexes (§6.2.2.1). Subjects are cross-indexed for singular, dual
and plural number. Objects distinguish singular and plural number. Comparing Momu with Baibai (§1.1.1, §D.1), dual distinctions appear to be a
recent innovation not present in Baibai.
Distinctions in person between subject and object cross-indexes are uneven as well. Subject cross-indexes distinguish first, second and third person
across all number values. Object cross-indexes distinguish local and third
person.
I use “local person” as a shorthand for the combination of grammatical
first and second person in a single form.2
A secondary system of object cross-indexation is available in the form of
1
Naturally there are cases where the conominal is not “optional”. Haspelmath (2013)
anticipates this in his paper. In Momu, conominal interrogative pronouns are a necessary
part of forming constituent questions (§10.3.2), and conominal comitative pronouns are a
necessary part of reflexive constructions (§10.2.3).
2
The distinction is problematic but well recognised in the literature, albeit with differing labels. For instance Silverstein (1976) breaks down the diﬀerence with a binary
feature +/- participant. Dahl (2000) diﬀerentiates egophoric and allophoric reference (or
later non-allophoric and allophoric (Dahl, 2008)). Haspelmath (2013) (building upon Dahl
(2000)) diﬀerentiates locuphoric reference from allophoric. I follow Aissen (1999b, inter
alia) in giving the combination of first and second persons the label “local person”.","[210, 211]"

ma-frog-story13.2.3Cause-eﬀectIn cause-eﬀect type serialisation, an event decomposes into two (or more)
sub-events, where some agent-driven activity results in some kind of eﬀect
upon an undergoer. A prototypical (or perhaps, just typical (following Durie,
1997, pp331–333)) cause-eﬀect SVC involves a transitive cause, and intransitive eﬀect. The object of the cause verb aligns with the subject or single
argument of the eﬀect verb. This is quite a departure from other SVC types
in that the subject “switches”, rather than being maintained.
In some languages, cause-eﬀect SVCs are strictly (or strictly defined by)
switch-function (e.g. François, 2006; Hajek, 2006), or “pivot SVC” (e.g. Jarkey, 2010, p118), but cause-eﬀect SVCs can occur outside this strict formal
criterion (Durie, 1997). Momu is a language with considerable variation in
the form of cause-eﬀect SVCs. Multiple combinations of valence are possible,
and the alignment of arguments between V1 and V2 is variable as well.
For instance, in (13.17a) the subject of the transitive uw ‘bite’ acts upon
the object, which in turn aligns with the single argument to the final intransitive nasuknu ‘feel pain.’ While the same pattern of transitivity holds
in (b), the alignment of V1 object to V2 subject does not. It is instead the
subject argument of the transitive cause V1 sista ‘worry about’ that aligns
with the sole argument of the eﬀect V2 petyin ‘run away’.

‘He ran away due to fear of an animal.’ferdi-tumbunaIt is not just alignments of arguments that can diﬀer in cause-eﬀect serialisation: so too do combinations of transitivity. In the above examples the
combination is transitive V1 with intransitive V2 . Two transitive verbs are
also possible, as are two intransitive verbs.
The examples in (13.18) serialise (a) two transitive verbs and (b) two
transitive verbs and one ditransitive verb. These show cause-eﬀect SVCs
of the kind where there is “on-going control over subsequent sub-events”
(Durie, 1997, p332). That is, preceding events must have occurred in order
for subsequent events to be possible. Note, however, that such examples are
not usually analysed as cause-eﬀect. These may alternatively be considered
sequenced actions per Aikhenvald (2006, p26). In these examples the object
(which happens to be kuwu ‘food’ in both examples) is shared between all
verbs in serialisation (and as the theme/patient object of the give verb in
(b)).

(13.19) involves two intransitive verbs in a cause-eﬀect SVC. So far, I am
only aware of this being possible with causes relating to intransitive motion
verbs. In (a) falling tuw is the cause for the branch being broken kaanu.
The order of the verbs can be reversed, as in (b). In this decomposition of
the event the cause is breaking, not striking, and this results in the eﬀect of
falling down. (c) is a common utterance to young children climbing trees.
Again, the cause is falling, and the eﬀect is death.","[457, 458, 459]"
"5.6An overview of possession in noun phrasesMultiple markers and constructions relating to possession are introduced
in the previous chapter and in this one, and further strategies in the form
of compounds are given in §14.1.2. In this section I compare possession
strategies that are coded in the form of an NP. I consider the locus of
marking, the order of possessor and possessed components, animacy, and
alienability. Predicative possession is considered in §11.4 and lack of possession in §11.10.
177The possible strategies for possession include genitive NPs (§4.8.5.1), genitive pronouns (§4.1.2) and possessed kin compounds (§14.1.2.5). There are
additionally possessive-attributive strategies which code possession-like relationships including proprietive NPs (§4.8.6), body part (or house) possessive
compounds (§14.1.2.4) and whole-part compounds (§14.1.2.2).
The relative order of possessor and possessed elements, the host of marking, and the intended referent of the construction are all plotted in Tables 5.4,
5.5, and 5.6.
First, considering the order of possessed and possessor elements, there is
a basic split between possessed-possessor and possessor-possessed strategies,
shown in Table 5.4. This split is represented on both sides by genitive NPs
in that either order is available (§4.8.5.2).

"1936.3.1Intransitive verb-forming suﬃx -ta(i)The intransitive verb-forming suﬃx -tai is identical in form to the verb tai
‘do’.
The same form is used in many aspectual constructions expressing an
imperfective sense (§7.5.3, §7.6, §7.4.3). In these grammaticalised cases the
form is not the host of subject inflection.10
-Ta(i) functions both as verb-forming suﬃx to bound roots and as a
derivational suﬃx to a variety of free root forms. In some cases the form of
the root determines the word class of the verb formed.
(6.10) shows some basic examples of intransitive verbs formed with -tai.
Kafok- in (a) is a bound root11 that combines with -tai ‘do’ or with transitive verb-forming suﬃxes (§6.3.3.1). In (b) and (c), the relationships between
the nominal forms bufo ‘thought’ and ofu ‘beads’ and their verbalised counterparts are clearer. Tai is very clearly used to verbalise nouns.

Unlike the transitive verb-forming suﬃxes (§6.3.3.1) that combine with many
bound roots and some free roots, the intransitive suﬃx can be seen as a
mostly derivational suﬃx applicable to free roots. As such it appears relatively productive in verbalisation of nominals.
The suﬃx derives an intransitive verb from members of a broad range
of word classes such as nouns, adjectives, numerals, demonstrative adverbs,
and quantifiers.
10Admittedly, grammaticalised aspectual uses of -ta do sometimes host subject inflection. The variability appears to be driven in part by whether a verb root distinguishes
first from third person singular subjects. It may be that -tai fills that gap in order to
maximise identity.
11
I have noticed in existing Western Momu data that the bound form kafok- is a noun
kafoku ‘fear.’ It is unclear whether the noun preceded the bound form or not. I never
encountered the nominal form in my own work. Kafok- was always a bound root used to
form intransitive and transitive verbs.","[221, 222]"
"32910.1.3Trivalent clausesAll trivalent clauses include three arguments: a subject plus either: two
objects, or two obliques, or an object and an oblique. As elsewhere, the
subject cannot be oblique-marked, and is cross-referenced on the verb. The
general preference in everyday Momu is to limit clauses to one or two (overt)
participants. Clauses which can be expressed as a single trivalent clause tend
instead to be broken apart into separate (serialised) clauses that introduce
participants individually (§13.3.3). As such, full clauses with three overt
arguments are actually quite rare in Momu.
The verb pair no/tu ‘give one/many’ is the only case where two objects
occur. These verbs alternate for the number of the theme (T) and crossreference the recipient (G) in the form of the verb. There is no general
preference for ordering of the two objects in the clause. The alternate positioning of the common theme wasim ‘pawpaw(s)’ and variable recipients
shown for both the singular (10.4) and plural (10.5) verbs are grammatical.

All other trivalent clauses combine a subject with an object and oblique (in
that order), or with two obliques.3
Below are some basic examples of trivalent clauses with a transitive predicate. Arguments for diﬀerentiating objects and obliques are given in 8.2.2.
3There are no examples in my corpus of two obliques occurring together in the one
clause. Admittedly, I did not confirm or refute this in elicitation. While it is likely
possible, further probing is necessary to confirm this.","[357, 358]"
"454graphically as such with a hyphen between forms.314.1.1Co-compoundsIn Momu, co-compounds (or coordinative compounds) are uncommon and
are certainly not productive like many sub-compounds. The forms are all
single phonological words. This is evident from a number of phonological
conditioning eﬀects. Most notably, lengthening of the vowel in any open
final syllable (§2.1.1) is limited to the second lexeme.
Almost all of the coordinative compounds discovered so far relate to
pairs or groups of people. Note that the order of nouns in these compounds
is fixed. For instance, (14.1a) gives the proper ordering of nouns, while the
reverse ordering in (b) is unattested.
(14.1) (a) mu-yime
women-men
‘people’
(b) * yime-mu
The above compound demonstrates phonological integration in two ways.
First, as an open mono-syllabic form, mu ‘woman’ would ordinarily be obligatorily lengthened (§2.4.1), but it remains shortened in the compound
form. The vowel in mu is also raised (§2.5.4), by coming into contact with
the initial glide in yime ‘man’.
The most common co-compounds involve possessed kin nouns, all of
which are listed at the end of §4.6.2. These co-compounds refer to pairs
in some form of special, and possibly reciprocal relationship. As such, few
combinations are possible. (14.2a) mufo-yefu ‘married couple’ is an obvious pairing, while (b) sifu-abfu ‘same sex sibling pair’ is perhaps less so.
It is, however, an important pairing in the context of reciprocal marriage
exchange.

Outside this chapter, those compounds that are especially exocentric may be written
as a single word (i.e., without hyphenation) with a single gloss. This leaves several degrees
of variation (and representation): at one end fully lexicalised forms which are given a single
gloss and no indication of their etymology, at the other separate lexical items with the
same glosses as they would have had they occurred alone. The nature of the compound
is reflected in the free translation.","[482, 483]"

is already topically active, having been previously introduced, and is thus
elided (§13.3.3).
Momu also has a range of case markers and postpositions that contribute
to the identification of oblique arguments (§8.2.3).
Non-subject participants marked with the comitative (§4.8.3) are instrumental oblique arguments (§8.2.3) as in (8.2a). However, instrumental oblique arguments can also be marked with the oblique =m, as in (b). The
comitative is also used to mark temporal adverbial adjuncts, as in (c).6 Finally, subjects alone can be coordinated with the comitative (§14.2.2) as in
(d), but not objects, which are instead either explicitly coordinated with the
comitative verb bar (§13.2.6) as in (e), or simply coordinated asyndetically
(§14.2.1.1).

"73will metathesise to create CG(V) sequences, where possible. CC sequences
created by inflectional morphology trigger deletion or epenthesis rules.
More generally, the addition of subject marking morphology can create
sequences that are not otherwise seen in mono-morphemic forms. The phonetic aﬀricate [tS] arises as the surface realisation of the sequence ts which
only occurs on verbs roots with a final t or ty and are inflected for the third
plural subject -si.
In the following sections I will review the morphophonological processes
of metathesis (§2.5.1.1), deletion (§2.5.1.2) and rounding (§2.5.1.3) that arise
from subject marking.
2.5.1.1GC metathesisThe general preference in Momu is for CG ordering over GC in both onsets
and word-finally (§2.3, §2.4). Where a verb root ends in a glide, the addition
of a subject marker triggers metathesis of root-final glide and inflectioninitial consonant. GC metatheses on morphological boundaries are found in
languages such as Yagua and Zoque, where they are similarly motivated by
phonotactic or timing preference resolutions to morphology (Hume, 2002;
Semiloﬀ-Zelasko, 1973).
In (2.57), the addition of a single-consonant inflectional morph triggers
metathesis of the final glide on the verb root. In these examples, the root
ends with a CG sequence, and the addition of a C triggers the G to move to
the right edge.
(2.57) (a) taty ‘shoot many’ + -f ‘2sgS’→ tatfy
(b) woky ‘go down’ + -r ‘1plS’ → wokry
(c) wory ‘come down’ + -m ‘2plS’ → wormy
If the inflection is of the form CV(V), epenthesis is less common but still possible between consonants in C1 C2 G sequences created by metathesis. Given
the vowel nucleus in the inflection, syllabification of C2 will not happen in
this scenario. In (2.58a) (and (2.60b) below) the metathesised glide creates
a heavy syllable. Note also that in (2.58a), metathesis brings about the
sequence tr not otherwise found in mono-morphemic words.55
55Considering other possible CG-final verb roots, the complex onsets kry, nry [n.drj]
and fry all become possible word-medially.","[101, 102]"
"48715.1Relative clausesRelative clauses are subordinate clauses that function as nominal modifiers
(Thompson, Longacre and Hwang, 2007). These clauses can function to restrict the reference of the nominal that they modify (Andrews, 2007; Keenan
and Comrie, 1977), but can also function to supplement a clause with detail
that extends beyond reference. Both types are considered here.2
The basic components of a relative clause in Momu are a head noun, a
reduced, sentence-like clause (§16.6), and a relativiser—in that order. The
distal demonstrative eru and sometimes the proximal form anu, and their
reduced counterparts3 e and a are used as relativisers in Momu. The relative clause is positioned after the noun that it modifies. Specific alternate
constructions exist for obliques (§15.1.2) and genitives (§15.1.3).
The overall NP containing the relative clause may be case-marked to
indicate its relation to the main clause. Because additional modifiers are
limited and uncommon, the case marker is generally applied to the relative
clause on the right edge. The noun being modified by the relative clause
is unmarked for its role within the subordinate clause. There is no relative
pronoun within the relative clause.4 In the absence of overt marking, the
role of the relativised head within the relative clause is often inferred from
context.
(15.1) shows examples of relative clauses where the head noun’s role
within the relative clause is (a) subject, (b) object, (c) location-oblique,
(d) instrument-oblique, (e) theme-oblique, and (f) genitive. Relative clauses
are marked in bold. These roles attract relational-case marking (except
subjects) in main clause positions (§4.8.1, §8.2.2, §8.2.3), but case is not in
any way marked on the head noun in the subordinate clause. The role of
the relativised noun in the relative clause is generally inferred from context.
That context includes the absence of an NP in the relevant position in the
relative clause, but then it is also very common for other elements (including
2
Not considered here: relative clauses in Momu are a major and common type of
insubordination (Heine, Kaltenböck and Kuteva, 2016). A casual glance over the example
texts (§A) will reveal many instances of insubordinate uses of the demonstratives anu and
eru. Unfortunately, for reasons of space, this topic will not be treated in this thesis.
3
The reduced relativisers e and a are clitics. Most commonly they form a phonological
word with a case marker, or they are enclitic to the predicate of the relative clause. The
combination of the relativiser anu with the directional marker =ti often reduces to anti.

Relative pronouns are not used generally, except in a subset of cases where a genitive
is relativised (§15.1.3).","[515, 516]"
"8.1.3Ordering of participantsThe typical, pragmatically unmarked ordering of participants relative to the
predicate in a clause is given by the following scale:
(8.4) Subject > Object(s) > Oblique(s) > Adjunct(s) (> Predicate)
A clause can have at most one subject,8 two objects, and multiple oblique
arguments and adjuncts, all preceding the predicate. There is no preferred
ordering of participants of the same category. Objects to a ditransitive verb
can occur in either order, but are preceded by the subject. Where multiple
oblique arguments occur, I am unaware of a preferred ordering between them,
but together they follow core arguments.
Generally speaking, all participants occur before the final predicate.
However, the final participant can sometimes occur immediately after the
verb. Such a positioning retains the linear ordering of participants relative
to the scale in (8.4). This post-predicate position can be diﬀerentiated from
extra-clausal “afterthought” style clarifications in that there is no pause.
Topical afterthought or right-dislocation (Lambrecht, 1996) can break
the above ordering of elements in that an argument higher in the scale can
occur after a lower one in a clarifying role in an afterthought. Topical afterthoughts are further diﬀerentiated from standard post-predicate position by
intonation. The post-predicate position typically occurs within the falling
terminal contour, while, for topical afterthoughts, that terminal contour falls
on the predicate, and the afterthought has a flat or rising intonation. Both
patterns of post-predicative positioning (including the combination of both)
are demonstrated below.

I argue that external possessors are placed within a topic slot preceding the subject.
In some cases this kind of construction has been argued to be a “double subject”. See

indicator that these objects are aﬀorded the same status of object by the
syntax. In combination with verbal number, such a coding of arguments for
a ‘give’ verb is not common in Papua New Guinea (Reesink, 2013),23 nor
around the world (Comrie, 2003).
Ditransitive verbs have two objects in a trivalent clause. Trivalent clauses
are otherwise predicated by a transitive verb containing an object and oblique
argument. The invariance of ordering (i.e., objects before oblique arguments,
§8.1.3) and, sometimes, case marking indicates the diﬀerence between objects
and oblique arguments for these clause types.
Consider three transitive verbs with similar meanings to ‘give’ when including an oblique: the high-transitive as ‘show/teach’ (8.18a), and the verb
pair naf(w)as/tyef(w)as ‘reveal/show one/many’ (8.18b). As ‘show/teach’
is a high-transitive verb,24 cross-referencing the G, and T is oblique. The
verb pair nafwas/tyefwas ‘reveal one/many’ code the number of the T by
stem alternation, and G is an oblique argument. A first or second person G
is not marked by object prefixes (just as it is not for ‘give’ either).
20Paradigms for the pair ‘give one/many’ are given in Table 6.11 on page 211.
See §8.1.4.1 for arguments that these verbs are ditransitive.
22
The ‘give’ verb can be used with a human T, but if first or second person, it is not
object prefixed.

Despite their similar semantics, these verbs map T and G diﬀerently onto
grammatical relations. Both verbs are confirmed as transitive via the features laid out in §8.1.4.1. Additionally, the object or oblique status of nonsubject arguments is confirmed by their fixed ordering (while the objects of
a ditransitive could occur in either order). The choice in alignment above
demonstrates the split in behaviour for coding objects such that {O=G} and
{O=T}. Transitive verbs essentially fall into these two categories.
The above trivalent clauses are concerned with a human recipient-G.
Many other trivalent constructions dis-prefer or disallow a human G. This
is the case for verbs of placement, or caused location. For instance, the G of
the verb etyinu cannot be a human referent. Instead a body part (formally
treated as inanimate) is given as G.

and the directional-marked mamoti ‘on the other side’ (b). However, G can
still be an oblique-marked NP as in kwo afam ‘to another tree’ in (b), or obim
‘in the pot’ in (c). Oblique argument status is confirmed by the transitive
status of the verbs in (a) and (b) on the basis of verbal number patterning
(§8.1.4.1), and also the fixed ordering of object and oblique arguments. For
(c) nukiy ‘load’ only the fixed ordering of T before G confirms that the T is
an object and G an oblique argument. For this verb, G cannot be marked
with directional case or a spatial postposition.

that the verb selects for the number of the object for both.","[328, 329, 330, 331]"

not appeal to the concept of a rhyme in order to describe syllabification in Momu.

use G for a glide, C for a consonant that is not a glide, and K for a consonant inclusive of

"629C.3Diachronic aside on the polysemy of na-In some cases there is a limited degree of polysemy between a plural intransitive form (e.g., napwen ‘many come’) and a singular transitivised form
(e.g., napwen ‘bring one’). It is interesting that the same morpheme derives
alternate forms that express diﬀerent number values, but it is possible to
hypothesise why such a development may have occurred.
The singular transitivising na- and the plural intransitive na- most likely
have grammaticalised from a single serial verb construction using the verb
*na ‘get’ (prior to the development of verbal number).13 A get verb is
a source of valence increasing morphology or constructions in many serial
verb languages (Aikhenvald, 2006, p13), and indeed is a common source for
causatives, instruments and patients (Heine and Kuteva, 2002, pp286–290).
While the likely source of the singular transitivising form na- is clear, the
plural form tye- is at present unclear. The plural correspondent of (pa)na
‘get one’ has the two forms pun ‘get many’ and popra(i) ‘get many’, neither
of which can be related to tye-.
How the same form came to be grammaticalised as a singular distinction
in the case of the transitivising prefix and a plural distinction in the case
of the intransitive plural can be explained by a semantic division in their
application and how this was integrated into the clause. First I assume that
GET had two uses in serialisation: to gather a person in order for them to
participate in an activity, and to gather an object in order to perform an
activity upon it. In both cases, the serial verb construction that preceded the
grammaticalisation was likely of the form get X (and) do-Y. I propose that a
human referent X combined with the (intransitive) motion-based activities,
and that a non-human referent X combined with transitive activity verbs
centrally concerned with altering X (e.g., transport, cut, process and
so on).
In the case of an intransitive do-Y, the human referent of X came to be
incorporated into the set of referents for the subject of do-Y. Most likely
this started with motion verbs and then generalised to the other intransitive
verbs (e.g., ‘I get them and go’ > ‘we go’). This construction still exists syn13Na means ‘marry’ in my main field site of Mori village, where they use the separate
lexical form pana to mean ‘get one’. Older and/or more conservative speakers in Savamui
and Mumuru villages use na for both ‘marry’ and ‘get one’, but recognise pana as a form
younger speakers have adopted.","[657, 658]"

13.3.4.2Scope of verbal numberFrequent topical elision of NP arguments often means that identifying the
role of participants in an SVC can be diﬃcult. Verbal number, not being
bound by grammatical constraints, can contribute to the identification of
referents in some specific combinations in SVCs. In this section, I focus on
the verb nukiy to demonstrate this.
Nukiy ‘load’ is a verb of containment which can be considered number
sensitive in that the speaker can make a choice between making a reference
to a contained plural entity, or reduce it to a singular one by referring to
the container (of course singular contained entities and plural containers
are possible—but not together). Nukiy ‘load’, like in English, has two case
frames diﬀerentiated by word order where either the contained or container is
coded as an object, and the other as an oblique. Nukiy does not code verbal
number, but within other SVC types such as a preparative (§13.2.3.1), the
verb following it can select for the number of either the container or contained
entities.
451Most commonly, both the contained and container NPs are topically
elided. In combination with the context of the utterance, the verbal number value of the following verb helps to diﬀerentiate which is being referred
to—either (a) the contained entities, or (b) the container.

Coordination is the combining of multiple units (coordinands) of the same
type (or similar type) such that combined they still fulfil the same role as a
single occurrence of that unit. In Momu, lexemes, phrases, and clauses can
all be coordinated. The means of marking the coordination varies depending
on the relationship between coordinands, and the type of the coordinands
(Haspelmath, 2007a).
Variation in length of coordinated elements, in the marking of coordination, and in the semantic features of the coordination such as overlap and
symmetry, all combine to indicate what Wälchli (2005) calls the “tightness”
of a given coordination. The tightest coordinations tend towards compounds.
Coordination is marked quite variably in the area. Imonda uses special clitics for coordination of phrasal units but juxtaposes clauses without
marking (Seiler, 1985). Kwomtari is similar to Momu, in mainly using juxtaposition, but also uses the comitative as a coordinator (Honsberger et al.,
2008). Waris has a rich array of coordinators including a marker of alternatives (disjunctive) not deriving from tp o (Brown, 1990). Barupu has a
conjunctive coordinator and an adversative coordinator (Corris, 2008).
In this chapter, I discuss mainly nominal compounds (§14.1) before moving on to coordination. Coordinative types considered include conjunctive
(§14.2), disjunctive (§14.3), and adversative coordination (§14.4). There are
a few diﬀerent means of expressing conditional constructions in Momu, and
the form linked with the restrictive marker =s is ambiguous with respect to
its subordinate or coordinate status (§15.6). For now, it is grouped alongside
other subordinate conditional types (§15.10.2.6).
45314.1Compounds and nominal sequencesThere is a spectrum of nominal-nominal sequences in Momu which range
from compounds to juxtaposition. At one end some compounds are more
fixed and lexical. At the other, there are productive patterns of combinations
of lexemes. Beyond this, straightforward juxtaposition becomes coordination
in Momu (§14).
There is no hard boundary between compounds and nominal sequences
in Momu, as there is some inter-speaker variation in form. I take phonological integration, including loss of segments, and semantic opaqueness as
indicators of compounding, and productivity as an indicator of sequencing.
Many combinations discussed here show both phonological integration and
productivity. The primary indicator of phonological integration is the lack
of lengthening (§2.4) on word-final vowels for the first form in a compound.
The most lexicalised of compounds in Momu are co-compounds1 (Wälchli,
2005). There are a handful of these in Momu, most of which are kin compounds expressing natural pairings (§4.6.2). In co-compounds, the two components contribute equally to produce a new unitary concept, such that
neither element alone expresses a degree of the same meaning. For this
reason, these co-compounds are exocentric (Aikhenvald, 2007).
“Sub-compounds” 2 are compounds where the relationship between components is uneven, and possibly hierarchical. One nominal in some way
determines the reference of the other. In Momu a range of diﬀerent types
of relationships between nouns is expressed by sub-compounds. These different types of relationship are determined partially by the word-class of the
nouns forming the compound, and partially by the semantics of the individual nouns. As sub-compounds tend to be more productive constructions,
phonological integration drops away, and these are better considered nominal
sequences rather than compounds.
In this section, I begin with the most restricted combinations of nouns
(which result in the most phonologically integrated words) and proceed to
the most productive combinations (which are clearly sequences of separate
phonological words). Integrated phonological words are represented ortho1Co-compounds are also known as dvandva compounds, pair words, or copulative compounds (Wälchli, 2005).

refers to the recipient of the information.
In all cases here, if one considers the speech complement as filling an
argument position, then the utterance complement is oblique according to
the criteria laid out in §8. For reported speech, the argument status or even
embedded status of such a complement is often disputed (De Roeck, 1994;
Thompson, 2002).
In order to be consistently interpreted as utterance predicates, the complement to these verbs usually follows the verb. Unlike many other complement clause types in this chapter, there is no complementiser.2 The form
of the complement is sentence-like (§16.6), and shows no restriction on the
marking of categories on the complement. The utterance is often accompanied by voice quality and intonation consistent with an independent clause.
All of these factors combined indicate that in Momu utterance complements
are the least syntactically integrated of all complement clauses, to the extent
that it is questionable whether they are subordinate at all.
Other strategies exist for conveying reported speech. A reference to the
source via an NP, followed immediately by the complement, or even just
a shift in voice quality in the absence of an utterance CTP can indicate a
shift in footing such that the hearer understands that the speech of another
person is being conveyed.

Some, but not all verbs in this subclass can inflect for non-third-person objects via object prefixes (§6.2.2.2). Unlike with high-transitive verbs, however, object prefixes are obligatory when there is a first or second person
referent.
A relatively common pattern in Momu is for verbs to pair, such that they
alternate for the number of an argument on an absolutive basis (§6.6), as we
have already seen for intransitive verbs (§3.1.1). Again, these vary from free
forms (e.g., (3.13a), §6.6.2.1) through to (most commonly) (b) forms derived
from a common intransitive base (§6.6.2.3), with some values in between
(§6.6.2.2). The majority of these verbs select for a non-human or inanimate
object, but in cases where their meaning has expanded to take in human
referents, they also employ object prefixes for speech-act participants. In
this case, each verb in the pair has a defective paradigm in line with the
number of the object.

verb. The two objects have no preferential order apart from both occurring
after the subject (§8.2.2). Both objects are oblique-marked.

Examples of various attested combinations are given in (2.27) through (2.34).
K is the most common segment in forming medial consonant clusters,
especially in combination with f or s. Epenthetic vowels are often and variably inserted between these clusters. Those forms with k and f clusters
are especially prone to random metathesis. More generally this metathesis
is a feature of many stop-fricative sequences in Momu. To my knowledge,
this type of metathesis is unmotivated by higher level considerations (for
instance, discourse pragmatics).35 A similar sporadic metathesis occurs in
Hua (Haiman, 1980, p25).
34Baron (p.c.) has found that this particular example resolves in Western Momu as
kwefita, with the glide moving to the left to preserve CGV ordering. I have heard similar
transformations, but it is less common in Eastern Momu.

relationship between an argument and predicate, in the tradition of macroroles (Foley and Van Valin Jr, 1984) or proto-roles (Dowty, 1991). The single
letter terms clearly come from existing well-recognised terminology but are
not intended to be abbreviations of them (e.g., S is not subject) (Dixon,
1979). They stand instead simply as defined.
Predicates are paired with arguments and roles are assigned accordingly.
Clauses are compared on the basis of valence. Combining arguments with
predicates via these relational mappings, we see below that common properties of arguments (via case marking, §8.1.2, argument indexing §8.1.4, and
relative order or position, §8.1.3) across predicate classes (§8.1.4) collapse
certain roles across clauses of diﬀering valence.","[312, 313]"

1.1The Momu language and its speakersThe Bewani Ranges are in the north-western corner of Papua New Guinea, in
Sandaun Province. They stretch from the border with West Papua eastward
to the Torricelli Ranges. At the eastern end of the Bewani ranges, there are
two strings of villages—one each on the northern and southern slopes. Momu
is spoken in these villages. An intricate web of tributaries flowing from the
ranges has created vast deltas on either side. Some maps indicate that the
language spreads north to the coast, but this is not the case. The villages are
spread out over a large area, with as little as an hour’s walk, but sometimes
up to two day’s walk between them. With so much distance, intermarriage
or other direct contact between the eastern-most and western-most villages
is unheard of.","[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"264Concerning the order of suﬃxation, it is clear that directional distinctions
(§7.5.2.1) are the inner-most. They are the most common, most phonologically integrated, and the most subject to lexicalisation.
Following directionals are “inner operators”: extended aspect (§7.5.2.2)
and exhaustive aspect (§7.5.2.3). These are more verb-like in that they host
subject marking. Between inner and outer is the transitional incompletive
(§7.5.2.4).
Finally, there are the “outer operators”: the distributive (§7.5.2.5), the
“until sunrise” aspect (§7.5.2.6). These are less verb-like, in that they do not
host subject inflection. Examples of the “lose-completive” -keyta (§7.5.2.7)
are too scarce to classify at the present stage of analysis.
7.5.2.1DirectionalsA distinction common in Papuan languages is optional marking for spatial
components called directionals or elevationals (Foley, 1986, pp148–152). The
verbs that are drawn upon to achieve this in Momu are most commonly the
spatial motion verbs (§3.6.2.1), but the basic motion verbs (§3.6.2.2) can also
be used in this way.
In Momu, the spatial motion verbs include directionals and elevationals.
These describe a path of motion with a (terminal) position of the most
aﬀected (i.e., absolutive) argument of the clause. By adding a telic feature,
this eﬀectively renders an activity as an achievement or accomplishment.
Basic motion verbs, on the other hand, are only directional, and project
a vector toward or away from the deictic centre. The riverine spatial motion
verbs in particular, when used in context, have an implied origin or terminal
point, but this is not the case with basic motion verbs. Hence the diﬀerence
in meaning as directionals.
The placement verb pair oton/bun ‘put one/many’ very commonly inflects for directionals. Some basic examples are given in (7.27).
(7.27) (a) oton/bun ‘put one/many’ + won ‘go up(river)’ →
otonon/bunon ‘put one/many up’
(b) oton/bun ‘put one/many’ + woky ‘go down(river)’ →
otonoky/bunoky ‘put one/many down’
(c) oton/bun ‘put one/many’ + woy ‘go across’ → otonoy/bunoy265‘put one/many across’15
As described so far, directionals in Momu could be considered a type of serial
verb construction (§13, or specifically a cause-eﬀect type: §13.2.3), however,
there is some evidence that grammaticalisation has proceeded further than
this. Directionals are the inner most operator for all aspectual operators in
Momu. As such they can occur within the progressive (§7.4).
Many serial verb constructions optionally mark the same subject on all
verbs. In the example below, it is clear that with separate subject marking,
this is a simple case of coordination. Note also, that for coordinated clauses,
the shared subject is the undergoer of the motion, not the object of the
transitive verb.16
(7.28) Ni bun-si,
won-si.
3pl put.many-3plS go.upriver-3plS
‘They put them and went upriver.’
The basic motion verbs code verbal number, but only the singular subject
forms17 are used as directional markers. For instance, the verb on ‘see’,
when combined with a directional marker, becomes a postural verb. In the
example below, the singular form pwen is used in onyipwen ‘face toward’,
despite multiple referents.
(7.29) Ne onyipwe=y-a-koy-nin-fi-u
eru.
and face.toward=d-impf-see.many-3plO-3duS-nzr that
‘And they are looking, facing toward them.’
ma-frog-story
Finally, the directional marking often tends towards lexicalisation. For instance, (7.27c) otonoy/bunoy ‘put one/many across’ has also lexicalised to
mean ‘lean one/many’.
15i.e., “put one/many inside” is the gloss of (7.27c) if the deictic centre is outside, or
“put one/many outside” is the gloss if the deictic centre is inside. Otonoy/bunoy has
also lexicalised as a postural verb meaning ‘lean one/many’, for standing an object up by
leaning it against something else.
16
When the motion of the object is together with the subject, a transitivised form of
the motion verb is employed (§13.2.3.2). Thus there are three types of transitive construction: independent motion of subject (coordination, as in (7.28)); independent motion of
object (directional marking); and co-ordinated motion (serial verb construction involving
a transitivised motion verb (§13.2.3.2)).

For pwen ‘one comes’ the singular form is the unmarked form. The plural verb is
derived: napwen ‘many come’. For ‘go’ the stems are dissimilar: pin ‘one goes’ versus ina
‘many go’.","[292, 293, 294]"
"13.1Identifying SVCsRelevant diagnostic and classificatory criteria for SVCs in Momu include
(1) concordant or shared subject marking and TAM marking; (2) the absence of marking of coordination or subordination, and the absence of sequence marking particles or expressions; (3) lexemic status; (4) the absence
of participants (especially non-subject participants); and (5) the ordering of
participants such that they precede verbs that do not license them.
Shared subject marking on the final verb indicates that the verbs or verb
phrases are not coordinated. This criterion is shared with compound forms,
and so is necessary but not suﬃcient. The primary indicators of coordination
or subordination in Momu are clause-level uses of relational case (§14.2, §15)
and nominalisation (§16.5). However, Momu is a language which includes
418intonational coordination (§14.2.1) as a coordinative strategy. That is, there
is no overt marking of coordination in some cases. However, combined with
subject marking, these two features serve to identify many SVCs in Momu.
At the more integrated end of the spectrum, I take loss of semantic
content in lexemes in a multi-verb construction as an indicator of grammaticalisation. This is not a clear cut category, rather a gradable one. The more
productive and semantically opaque a verb is within one of these constructions, the more likely I treat it not as an SVC, but rather something else.
For instance, the order in which the aspectual suﬃxes are presented in §7.5.2
is analogous to the degree to which I consider them grammaticalised. Forms
like pan ‘do until sunrise’ (§7.5.2.6) or ketyai ‘incompletive’ (§7.5.2.7) could
reasonably be considered an SVC that has more recently begun the path to
grammaticalisation.
There is a general restriction on the number of overt participants that can
be included within, or accompany an SVC. Multiple participants preceding
a verb is an indicator that the verb is not in serialisation with the verbs that
follow it. Restriction or absence of relational-case marking on participants is
indicative of serialisation (§13.3.3). In some cases, a participant is separated
from the verb that licenses it, and the verbs in serialisation form a contiguous
unit (per Aikhenvald, 2006). Momu has both contiguous and non-contiguous
SVCs. Where an argument is separated from the verb that licenses it by a
prior verb or verbs in a contiguous collection of verbs, I take this as a strong
indicator that this is in fact an SVC.
In (13.1), (13.2) and (13.3) below are some basic examples of SVCs in
Momu, which demonstrate all of these defining criteria.
In (13.1a) we see a marginal type of cause-eﬀect SVC (§13.2.3). The
two verbs in serialisation are kaani ‘cook’ and kiy ‘consume’. The verbs
are tightly bound together as a single phonological word. The subject is
marked once, on the final verb. There is no marking to indicate that the
material preceding kisyi is subordinate to the the final verb. Compare this
to the adverbial clause (§15.3) in (13.1b), where the subordinate relationship
is indicated by the comitative.1 TAM marking, where present, only occurs
on the final verb in a SVC. The presence of TAM marking on both verbs in
1Subordinate clauses are always overtly marked in Momu, but note that coordinate
clauses are not. See §14.2.1.3 for more detail on intonational coordination of clauses. So,
while the presence of subordinate marking diﬀerentiates subordination from SVCs, the
absence of marking alone does not diﬀerentiate coordinated clauses from SVCs.","[446, 447]"
"66For word-final CG sequences, the glide typically surfaces as devoiced (§2.1.3).

˚˚Complex word-final clusters
arising from suﬃxingIn §2.3.2.2 I demonstrate word-final CC(G) and GC sequences. Here I discuss
the syllabification of these sequences.
Beginning with C1 C2 #, these syllabify diﬀerently depending on the natural class of C2 (t, b, r, f, s, m).46 C2 sonorants (m, b, and r ) become syllabic
in this position, and C1 is then assigned as the onset of this syllable.
(2.41) (a) pupm [pŬ.pm] ‘bush knife + oblique’
""
(b) arm [P5.rm] ‘you pl. + oblique’
""
(c) kosm [kŎ.sm] ‘road + oblique’
""
(2.42) (a) atb [P5.tà] ‘when we were (there)’
""
(b) panb [pa.nà] ‘when the sun rose’
""
(c) tukb [tŬ.kà] ‘with urine’
""
The first plural subject marker -t/-r has two forms that occur mostly in free
variation. The morpheme usually surfaces as t in word-final Ct when C is
more sonorous. A syllabic r is used when preceded by a stop (2.43d).
45The order of these final CG sequences matches that of an onset. In a limited set
of circumstances, the morphophonemic rules of Momu even provides a mechanism for
preserving this ordering in the context of suﬃxing morphology (§2.5.1.1). Given that
these word-final sequences have the appearances of an onset, an approach such as Harris
and Gussmann (2002) where the word-final coda is instead taken to be the onset of an
abstract empty syllable, may be applicable to Momu.
46
Prior to syllabification, many forms given here are subject to morphophonological
processes which move or delete glides (§2.5). Only the resolved forms are shown here.","[94, 95]"

‘He’s repeatedly throwing his fist at her jaw.’
picture-task-part27.5.2Dynamic (“suﬃxing”) aspectsThe suﬃxing aspects are all concerned with deriving situation aspect. The
forms considered here (the “suﬃxing aspects”) are all concerned with various
features related to events. The stativiser, while also suﬃxing, is considered
separately (§7.5.3).
All suﬃxing aspects can be related to synchronic full verbs. All probably
arose from grammaticalisation of serial verb constructions. Many relate to
cause-eﬀect type serialisation (§13.2.3). Cause-eﬀect serialisations are otherwise not all that common in Momu.
I treat suﬃxing aspects here as verb marking rather than serialisation for
several reasons. First, the suﬃxes generally combine with a verb as a single
phonological word. They variably show some sign of grammaticalisation,
ranging from phonological reduction to loss of semantic detail, or loss of
inflectional categories. Some suﬃxes host subject marking, while others
do not, but generally speaking if both host subject marking then they are
interpreted as serial or coordinated verbs.13 A major test is progressivisation.
Suﬃxed forms can be progressivised, while in serial verb constructions, only
the final verb can be progressivised.
Verbs marked by any of the suﬃxes in this section are events, and as
such are perfective in the absence of further marking.14 These marked forms
can be rendered imperfective with the addition of the imperfective marker
a(i)-.
The forms discussed here show varying degrees of grammaticalisation,
analogous to the relative order in which they apply to a verb stem, with
those forms closest to the stem being the most grammaticalised. I break
them down into three rough categories, as indicated below:
(7.26) VERB ROOT -(DIRECTION) -(INNER) -(OUTER)
13In very specific cases, a suﬃxing aspect may not generally host subject inflection, but
becomes the host of inflection when the verb root is unable to distinguish some values due
to phonologically conditioned syncretism (§6.2.1).
14
The only suﬃxing form that has an imperfective reading is the stativiser -ta(i) (§7.5.3).","[291, 292]"
"15.10.2Adverbial clausesAdverbial clauses are a clause type conveying detail relevant to the main
clause as a whole.
15.10.2.1TimeTime adverbial clauses concern the temporal sequencing of events. In Momu,
this is achieved by several diﬀerent construction types including comitative,
completive and clause linking adverbial constructions (§15.3, §15.4, §15.9).
Backgrounding (§15.5) and absolutive (§15.7) adverbial clauses, while not
primarily about temporal sequencing, can describe events that follow each
other.
Very “tight” sequences (in the sense of Wälchli (2005)) tend to be expressed as serial verb constructions in Momu (§13). Looser temporal sequences can be expressed by unmarked coordination (§14), and the tem521poral nature of that sequencing can be augmented by certain adverbs (§9.5),
usually occurring in the second of a pair of coordinated clauses.
For temporal sequencing in adverbial clauses, a perfective viewpoint is
used for both main clause and subordinate clause. Completive adverbial
clauses signal nearly co-temporal events (§15.10.2.5). The completive-marked
event is the initiating boundary for the main clause event. As such, the temporal sequencing is close. Comitative adverbial clauses, on the other hand,
signal temporal sequencing that need not be close. Events related by a backgrounding clause are loosely temporally sequenced (§15.5), but in addition
to this, the background clause is usually relevant to the main clause in some
way (e.g., as a cause). Preliminary analysis of the clause linker =bus is that
it is similarly loose, but what additional meaning it adds is unclear at this
point.
For completive temporal sequences, it is possible for perfective completive
clauses to temporally precede an imperfective main clause as well. The
equivalent viewpoint aspect for comitative clauses indicates overlap.
While temporal sequencing of coordination is iconic (i.e., the order of
clauses reflects the order of events), adverbial clauses need not be so. For
both comitative and completive adverbials, when they occur after the main
clause, their sequence is non-iconic.
15.10.2.2LocationMomu lacks a dedicated location adverbial construction. Such information
is usually coded by a relative clause (§15.1), including special relative clause
forms (§15.2). It is particularly common for a headless relative clause to fill
this role.15
15.10.2.3MannerManner is not expressed by adverbial clauses in Momu.16 Otherwise, manner is expressed by dedicated serial verb constructions (§13.2.1), or more
15For some headless relative clauses, it is not always clear that they are filling a location
role for the main clause. Instead, the relative clauses appear to function as contextualising
comments, and that the most easily identifiable role for these clauses is to locate the event.
16
There is a single example of a manner adverbial clause amongst overwhelmingly temporal uses of the comitative (§15.3). The clause uftab ‘do firmly/strongly’ in (15.23a) on
page 501 appears to be a genuine manner adverbial.","[549, 550]"
"122The comitative marker on nominals has diﬀerent functions to the pronominal
marker. It functions as a coordinator of subject NPs (§4.8.3.1, §14.2.2) and
marks instrumental obliques (§4.8.3.2, §8.2.3). Temporal adverbs are marked
with the comitative (§4.8.3.3). The comitative also marks temporal adverbial
clauses (§15.3).
Comitative pronouns are a necessary component of reflexive clauses (§10.2.3.1).3
However, comitative pronouns are employed in clauses without a reflexive
meaning. At the present stage of analysis, I believe such uses are emphatic,
however further work is necessary to fully understand it.44.1.2Genitive pronounsThe sub-paradigm for genitive pronouns exhibits some irregularities. First,
there exist two diﬀerent genitive markers diﬀerentiated by the number of the
possessor. The majority of the plural forms of genitive pronouns are formed
with the singular genitive -u. Only the third person plural form uses the
plural genitive -nu. The combination of the genitive with the first singular
form te results in the form to. The second person plural form is syncretic
with the second plural person comitative-genitive form arebu.5

The genitive forms have a diﬀerent distribution to genitive NPs. With a
genitive NP, the possessed and possessor can commute (§11.4). This is not
the case for genitive pronouns, where the order is fixed. (4.2) shows the two
3Interestingly, in Imonda a similar “emphatic pronoun” is formed by a (possibly cognate) suﬃx -f and these are used for reflexive constructions (Seiler, 1985).
4
One possible interpretation is that the comitative pronouns contrast with noncomitative forms by coding a sense of associativity analogous to the associative function
of the comitative case marked on nominals. This doesn’t fit the sense conveyed by the
singular comitative pronouns. But with plural forms the sense conveyed is perhaps an
indication of an expanded set of referents.
5
Although I give a unique form for the first person plural genitive, this form was only
found in elicitation. As with the syncretic arebu, I suspect the comitative-genitive form
yerebu is more commonly used in place of yeru. This is possibly influenced by the collision
of the form yeru with a common pattern of resyllabification of the final y in forms like
kosy ‘road’ onto a following demonstrative eru producing a homophonous yeru. Thus,
kosy eru ‘that road’ and kosy yeru ‘our road’ are homophonous.","[150, 151]"
"297Subjects of transitive verbs are identical: they are the first argument in the
clause and are cross-referenced on the verb in the same manner. Again, the
{S=A} subject cannot be oblique-marked.
(8.13) (a) Slupi bekubeku=m nepru.
Slupi things=obl trans>one:go\3sgS
‘Slupi took the things.’
(b) Slupi yime=m

‘Slupi shot the man dead.’
A subset of state verbs which select for non-human subjects only have a
third person singular subject form available. (8.14a) is an example of the
(inchoative) verbal counterpart to the adjective motu ‘black’ which can also
function as a predicate, as in (8.15a). A human subject is not possible for
these verbs. An alternate coding strategy of external possession is used
(§10.2.1), where the human possessor is expressed as a topic. This is the
case in (b) where the initial pronoun is an extra-clausal topical possessor.
(8.14) (a) Wune muti-ta.

‘A stone / stones is/are blackened.’
(b) Te ebsi titi-ta.
1sg leg painful-inch
‘My leg(s) hurt.’
(c) Kwo feku
kaanu.
tree branch be.broken
‘The branch(es) is(/are) broken.’
There are also many non-verbal predicates (§11). Clause-initial position
indicates the subject for all of these constructions. Amongst non-verbal
predicates are various nominal predicates. For instance, attributives are
expressed by adjectival predicates, as in (8.15a), and proprietive predicates
298are expressed by proprietive-marked NPs, as in (8.15b). (8.15c) demonstrates
the only two place non-verbal predicate that I am aware of at this stage in
the analysis. Many non-verbal predicates select for an inanimate subject. In
some cases external possession is used with these predicates as well.
(8.15) (a) Wune motu.
stone black
‘The stone is black.’
(b) Te nwu=bu.
1sg mustard.flower=prop
‘I have mustard flowers.’
(c) Te nwu
momu.
1sg mustard.flower neg
‘I don’t have mustard flowers.’
There is a set of attributive constructions that show an alternate coding of
subject. These constructions describe a human referent as being in an experiential state (happy, sad, sick etc.). These have a basic adjectival predicate
form, like that shown in (8.15a), and alternate coding where the experiencer
and experiential state are linked by a verbal copula. With the animate existential functioning as a copula, the normal order of subject and predicate
complement are maintained. With the inanimate existential functioning as
a copula, the order of subject and predicate complement is reversed. Thus
the choice of copula determines where the subject is expressed.18
In (8.16a) the experience emsum ‘good/happy’ is the predicate complement. By switching the animate existential verb to the inanimate counterpart in (b), the experiential source then sits in what is otherwise the {S=A}
subject position. This alternate construction has a subtly diﬀerent meaning
whereby the experiencer lacks volitionality over the experience.
(8.16)2008.210(a) Te emsu=m
n-a-ya.
1sg good=obl px-[impf]anim:there.be-1sgS:nzr
‘I am happy.’
(b) Emsu te=m
n-o-wo.
good 1sg=obl px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
‘I am lucky.’
18
Put another way, the choice of copula could be seen as promoting or demoting the
subject.","[325, 326, 327]"
"11.12.3CopulasBoth the animate existential ai ‘be / there is’ and the inanimate existential
wu are used as copulas with attributional predicates. In these constructions,
the copula is more verb-like in that the subject is cross-referenced on the
382animate form of the existential verb. Limited modal and aspectual inflection
is available as well.
Two possible codings are available when the existential verbs are used
as copulas. The two verbs select for the animacy of their subject. The
attributive adjective can then be positioned in the initial “subject” slot, as in
(11.52b). The realis progressive form of the copula is used to indicate that
the state of aﬀairs currently holds but does not imply that it will be ongoing
(or has previously been the case).
(11.52)2008.210(a) Te emsu=m

‘I am good/happy.’
(b) Emsu te=m
n-o-wo.
good 1sg=obl px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
‘I am good/lucky.’
When both subject and predicate are inanimate, argument order cannot be
altered. The subject fills the subject position.
(11.53) Fyi
meka=m y-o-wo.
water cold=obl d-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
‘The water is cold.’2008.437The above examples are imperfective, but a perfective copula is possible.
Both examples in (11.54) use the perfective form to indicate that the attributive state previously held, and does not necessarily hold anymore.

use of these forms appears to be in decline.15 Of these, I encountered only
two which were used predicatively: kamefe/kamey ‘know(ledge)’ and kwobo
‘ignorance’. These experiential nouns can also be used with a copula.
In (11.55a), kamefe ‘know(ledge)’ is used as a predicate. In (c), in combination with a copula, it is coded as the subject of the clause.

2008.210
Similarly, in (11.56) ‘sickness’ can be coded by a verbal strategy as in (11.56a)
(here efeke ‘sick’ is an optional dummy object), but a nominal strategy employing the copula is possible as well as in (b). As in (11.55c), the experiencer
is coded as the object in (11.56b).
(11.56)2008.210(a) Te efeke a-sukni.

(b) Efeke te=m

sick
1sg=obl px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
‘I am sick. (lit. sickness is to/with me)’
The experiencer (te ‘me’ in (11.56b)) is often topicalised (fronted) as in
(11.57). Note, however, that efeke cannot be oblique-marked, and that the
verb is a form selecting for an inanimate subject.
(11.57) Te efeke
y-o-wo.
1sg sickness d-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
‘I am sick.’
152008.210I am aware from Baron’s discussions of these experiential nouns (Baron, 1979, 1983a,b,
1984) that the nominal forms sisu ‘worry’ and kafoku ‘fear’ were or are in use in Western
Momu. While Eastern Momu speakers recognise the forms when prompted, I only ever
encountered these as verbs: sista ‘be worried’, kafokta ‘be afraid’ and kafokyer ‘afraid of’.","[410, 411, 412]"

verbs (§3.1.1.2), without displaying the adjective-inchoative alternation. Instead, all appear to be formed with an alternative intransitive verbaliser -nu
(§6.3.2), and no underived adjectival equivalent exists. These verbs both
pre-modify verbs in serialisation to express manner serialisations (§13.2.1),
and many also modify nouns, in the same fashion as adjectives (§3.3.1).
Almost all of these forms select for an inanimate subject, and do not
select for or agree with the number of the subject, as per inchoative verbs
above. As such, these forms typically have a fixed form, which carries the
appearance of a third person singular subject. By this, I mean that the final
segment in the form is u, consistent with the rounding process that marks
the third singular (§2.5.1.3).10 Additional inflectional possibilities such as
TAM categories are restricted, in line with these verbs expressing states.
(3.9) (a) fwafnu ‘lie balled up (of dog)’
(b) uyenu ‘be hot’
(c) fufnu ‘be swollen (of body part)’
(d) sayinu ‘be ripe/red (of fruit)’
(e) pwinu ‘be filled (of container)’
(f)mwikinu ‘be grimacing (of mouth)’The semantic spread of these verbs includes both property and locational
predicates meanings within the typology of intransitive predicates given by
Stassen (1997). Such predicates are more commonly coded by nominal forms
in Momu, but these forms sit somewhere between verbal and nominal coding
(§11.12). Some terms here are reminiscent of Nen positional verbs which
show far more irregular morphology compared to other verbs, and are a
morphological indicator of state-hood (Evans, 2014). Momu however has
separate postural verbs which do not fall into this class, especially those
that apply to human or animate subjects.11
10The final u segment could be interpreted as a remnant of the nominaliser -u, as these
forms do not have underived counterparts. The closed class of adjectives also have a
similar rounded final segment (§2.5.2), but unlike adjectives, these forms do not have
special verbalised counterparts. Hence, they are considered less prototypical (intransitive)
verbs. These forms most commonly end with the segments nu, which I hypothesise was a
formerly productive verbaliser or verb-forming suﬃx (§6.3.2).
11
Note the stative -nu verbs exhibit a similar patterning to the inchoative verbs. Al-953.1.2Transitive VerbsTransitive verbs take all of the inflectional possibilities of intransitive verbs.
In addition to licensing a subject argument (§8.2.1), mono-transitive verbs
license one of two object types (§8.2.2). These object types are diﬀerentiated
only by verb class, not by case marking or word order.12
In this thesis I occasionally refer to mono-transitive verbs as high- (§3.1.2.1)
and low-transitive (§3.1.2.2) subtypes. The distinction is minor but has some
ramifications in serial verb constructions (§13.3.3).13 For the purposes of
identifying word classes, the two types have diﬀering additional criteria for
identification.
3.1.2.1High-transitive verbsMembers of this word class are straightforwardly identifiable as verbs formed
with object cross-indexing verb-forming suﬃxes (§6.3.3.1).14 These verbs
express meanings where the undergoer is typically human, such as bakyer
‘ridicule’, ekyen ‘help’, or the speech verb yeyen ‘say to’. A minority of
these verbs equally target human or non-human referents such as on ‘see
(one)’, or kafokyer ‘fear’. Some even appear to more commonly apply to
non-human referents (e.g., ien ‘pull’).15
though some of the states described here are of human referents, the target is usually an
inanimate body part. Also similar to the inchoative verbs, a description of the position of
a body part is often the means employed to describe an emotional state, or the manner
in which an activity is performed (§13.2.1).
12
It is a bit of a stretch to refer to the two objects types as a “split object” in the
sense of Dryer (1986). The features of alignment are consistently accusative in Momu
(with exceptions noted below in §3.1.2.2). They do not vary in the fashion of, say, Taba
(Bowden, 2001, 2011), where the split is between accusative and absolutive strategies for
both subjects and objects. The division is in the constructional sense as employed by Bickel
(2010). The bearing that the split has on the syntax is minimal: objects are frequently
shared between transitive verbs in serial verb constructions, but not between the two
object types. I am not aware of the division aﬀecting any other syntactic constructions.
13
While the terms are most notably associated with pragmatic or discourse use per Hopper and Thompson (1980), the binary distinction made in this thesis actually has gradable
realisation, morphologically, as considered in §8.1.4, when diﬀerentiating predicates types
for the purposes of identifying grammatical relations. The intention here is to provide a
short label that roughly aligns with the semantics of the division between these classes
of transitive verbs. The morpho-syntactic realisation does not perfectly align with the
semantic or pragmatic notion of transitivity, however.
14
See also §6.4.3, for examples of verbs with full object cross-referencing where the
values are fused into the form of the verb. This is also the case for the ditransitive verb
pair no/tu ‘give one/many’.
15
At the end of the spectrum of human to non-human selectional preferences amongst
these verbs are verbs that ambiguously sit on the border between the two transitive verb96Verb-forming suﬃxes diﬀerentiate the person and number of the object.
A third person is diﬀerentiated from non-third-persons and singular number
from non-singular. There are two sets of verb-forming suﬃxes which I differentiate on the basis of their contrasting final segments: n-set and r-set
forms (§6.2.2.1).
Each possible object person-number combination is shown in the example
below.
‘fear’
(3.10)SGPL1|2kafokwarkafokmar3kafokyenkafoknintaMembers of this class frequently and redundantly mark the object with a
prefix. The prefix is entirely optional, however, and only distinguishes nonthird-person values.
(3.11) Ay te=m
wa-pupw-a-f.
2sg 1sg=obl 1|2sgO-beat-1|2sgO:vtr-2sgS
‘You beat me up.’
3.1.2.2Low-Transitive verbsLow-transitive verbs are simply defined as the inverse to the high-transitive
verbs. While high-transitive verbs exhibit full object cross-indexation via
verb-forming suﬃxes, low-transitive verbs exhibit a gradient from close to
high-transitive, through to lower transitivity. Prototypically this subclass
includes verbs that select for non-human objects. Some verbs in this subclass
select for the number of the object (§6.6).
Verbs in this subclass include free forms (3.12a), or bound forms combining with verb-forming suﬃxes (b)-(d). The bound forms draw upon sets of
verb-forming morphology (some of which overlap with other sets, including
those that form high-transitive verbs). There is a general mono-transitive
verb-forming suﬃx -ar (cf. ar ‘do to’) used as a verbaliser or (b) to incorporate transitive loanwords (§6.3.4), or sometimes evident in forms without
an identifiable bound root (c). The first singular and third plural object
suﬃxes from the n-final set of verb-forming morphology are sometimes used
to form verbs which select for the number of the object.16
sub-classes (§8.1.4).
16
Note that what is elsewhere a suﬃx cross-referencing a first singular object (-an) is
used in (d) for a singular object regardless of person.","[122, 123, 124, 125]"

‘I don’t eat this.’5.5ferdi-tumbunaNumerals and numeral sequencesThe numbers one and two are expressed by the lexemes fasni/faskaney ‘one’
and (tye)nebem ‘two.’ Some speakers express ‘three’ as (tye)nebem ef ‘two
and another.’ As a modifier to a nominal, this is the extent of ordinary uses
of numeral sequences. As ascending counting forms, there are extended uses,
however.6
Occasionally speakers use gestures to hands and/or feet to indicate numbers roughly around 5, 10, 15 and 20. These larger numbers are often approximations.
The lexemes fasni/faskaney ‘one’ and (tye)nebem ‘two’ have diﬀerent
distributions, and do not constitute a word class on their own (§3.3.2).
Fasni/faskaney ‘one’ always stands separate to the expression of numeral
sequences. (Tye)nebem ‘two’ combines with itself, or with ef ‘and another’7
to produce larger numbers. Some basic phrase structure rules are given in
(5.41).
(5.41) (a) NUM.SEQ ! fasni/faskaney | (tye)nebem (ef )* | NUM.SEQ’
(b) NUM.SEQ’ ! (tye)nebem (ef ) (NUM.SEQ’)A numeral sequence may be made up of either the single lexemes fasni/faskaney
‘one’ or (tye)nebem ‘two’, or the lexeme (tye)nebem followed by any number
of the lexeme ef ‘and another’, or a complex sequence repeating by factors
of two or three.
Sequences representing the possible ways of expressing numbers up to 6
are given in Table 5.3. Speakers used one of four strategies for expressing

The task can be self-directed, as a memory or calculation aid. It is usually the end result

Through verbal and non-verbal tests designed to measure aspects of numeracy, I witnessed a handful of older speakers (amongst 30 test subjects)
who could utilise methods (1) or (2) to perform basic addition and subtraction tasks for quantities up to 10.8 Almost all younger speakers were unable
to use Momu numerals for addition and subtraction tasks. All strategies lead
to decreasing accuracy with higher order counts (up to 10), but strategy (3)
more so than (1) or (2). The ability to count backwards in Momu or Tok
Pisin was usually predictive of a degree of numeracy in the tasks.9 The
tasks were designed to identify counts of objects (and manipulation of their
number) with verbal and non-verbal prompts and responses.10
In his field notes, Laycock (n.d.[d], p249) records numbers up to four
(nebem afa nebem ‘two and another two’) and kwobo ‘many’ for speakers
from Mumuru village (and other undisclosed locations) versus numbers of
up to two (nebem) for a speaker from Mori village before getting responses
in Tok Pisin (Laycock, n.d.[d], p191).11 Given the heterogeneity of responses,
8With 10 subjects, I ran tests similar to those described in Frank et al. (2008). The
tests were nonverbal matching tasks, verbally directed “nuts in a can” tasks, ascending and
descending elicitation/translation tasks (verbally and nonverbally prompted), and verbal
and nonverbal assessment of numbers under addition and subtraction conditions.
9
By “numeracy” I mean here not the ability to identify and name quantity, but rather
addition and subtraction.
10
Note that Momu does not have a question word for querying quantities. For verbal
requests for number I used the tp haumas(pela) ‘how many.’
11
This is assumed to be a sample size of two across the two villages listed (Mori and
Mumuru), but it is possible that elicitation was undertaken with a group. I recorded a
greater degree of variability in both Mori and Mumuru.","[201, 202, 203]"
"3.5Minor word classes3.5.1Spatial postpositionsPostpositions in Momu are limited to a pair of spatial terms (§3.5.1). At the
clause level these postpositions signal that the overall phrasal unit is functioning as a locative oblique (§8.2.3). Postpositional phrases can function
adnominally in locative NPs.
The spatial postpositions are niny ‘above/on’ and tin ‘inside’ (3.28).
These postpositions occur in complementary distribution with relational
markers such as the oblique and directional cases, (3.29). Additional spatial
distinctions are otherwise made by spatial nominals (§4.4) or verbs (§3.6.2).

first, second and third persons (§4.1).23 In addition to this, personal pronouns can be marked with the comitative (§4.1.1), genitive (§4.1.2), or both
(§4.1.3). There are additionally special emphatic forms that are fused with
the reciprocal-emphatic adverb ak (§4.1.4). Finally, there is a unique and
rare third singular form wotine ‘s/he, for his part’ (§4.1.5).
Momu does not generally employ a relative pronoun unless a possessor of
an alienable referent is relativised. In this case, a genitive-marked pronoun
is used as a relative pronoun (§15.1.3). There is a single indefinite pronoun bekubeku ‘(some)thing(s)’. This is a reduplicated form of the question
word beku ‘what’—a common source of indefinites in the world’s languages
(Haspelmath, 1997, p179). The demonstratives also function pronominally
(§5.4.5).
23
The dimensions of the personal pronouns diﬀer from argument cross-reference in lacking a dual distinction (§6.2.1). Conversely, there are several syncretic patterns in both
subject and object cross-reference (§6.4).","[134, 135]"
"462.1.4.1/Ve/ diphthongsThe three vowel-vowel diphthongs, /ae/, /Oe/ and /oe/ are perceptually close
to the vowel-glide diphthongs /aj/, /Oj/ and /oj/. Minimal pairs diﬀerentiating them are given below.
The starting points in the diphthongs /aj/ and /ae/ are quite noticeably
diﬀerent. The diphthong /ae/ sometimes drops the final vowel, especially
in heavier syllables, but because the fronted [æ] is still present, it is clearly
distinguished.
(2.10)/aj/:/aj/[P5j]‘you (sg.)’/ae/:/ae/[Pæe]‘be (anim.)’In /Oj/ and /Oe/ the starting point is the same [O], but the end point is
slightly diﬀerent.
(2.11)/Oj/:/sOj/[sOj]‘type of eagle’/Oe/:/sOe/[sOe]‘I exchange it’The starting point for the diphthong /oj/ is higher than /oe/, as it is pulled
higher by the glide (§2.1.4.2). In the next section I discuss diﬀerentiating
/oj/ and /we/ further.
(2.12)/we/:/jEsawe/[jĔsawi]‘sago palm sp.’/oj/:/moj/[mŨj]‘cassowary’/oe/:/foe/[foe]‘I open it’The VV and VG diphthongs can be further diﬀerentiated from each other
by their very diﬀerent interaction with suﬃxing morphology (§2.5).
2.1.4.2Mid-high vowel and glide diphthongsThe combinations of mid-high vowels (/e/ and /o/) with glides are a special
case. Although glides aﬀect the non-mid-high vowels only minimally, in the
neighbourhood of glides, mid-high vowels are realised as higher. In the most
extreme case—/je/ and /wo/—they surface as monophthongal long pure
high vowels (§2.1.4.3).
The combinations /jo/, /oj/ and /we/ are high ([ji], [uj], [wi]) or near
high ([jI], [Uj], [wI]) vowel diphthongs. /ew/ is unattested.
(2.13) /jo/: /Esjo/ [PĔsj ju] ‘dog’, /junje/ [jundi] ‘sun’
47(2.14) /oj/: /moj/ [mŨj] ‘cassowary’, /ojmo/ [PUjmõ] ‘I will cut it’
(2.15) /we/: /mwe/ [mbw wi] ‘cassowary’, /wenase/ [wIn˘ã se] ‘they swing’
The choice between the phonemicisation /oj/ and /we/ can be a little diﬃcult
to determine. While they contrast word-initially, elsewhere they are noncontrastive (and subject to variation). Take /mwe/ or /moj/ for “cassowary”.
Some speakers make a noticeable denasalisation of the initial nasal ([mbw wi]),
while others do not. Transcribing as /mwe/ with the glide next to the nasal
would be one way of indicating this denasalisation. Only a subset of the
consonants vary when followed by a glide, so, in this case, it is probably
safer to opt for the more generally preferred ordering of GV. VG ordering
only occurs word-finally in mono-morphemic words.
The sequences /ej/ and /ow/ arise only in a limited set of lexemes. Firstly
they only occur in the verbs /kej/ ‘eat’, /sej/ ‘urinate’, /nej/ ‘shoot one’,
/mOàkej/ ‘lay out’, /nafOfkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’ and /nokej/ ‘fill up’. These
verbs then have corresponding rounded third person singular subject forms
/kow/, /sow/, /now/ and /nokow/. Speakers refer to this as TP nek hevi
‘heavy voice’. The starting point of the diphthong varies a little from speaker
to speaker, with surface realisations of [Ij ⇠ @j ⇠ 1j] attested with corresponding back variants [Uw ⇠ @w ⇠ 0w].19For a subset of these forms in Eastern Momu, the possibility of the diph-thong arising via a linker vowel remains an open question (§2.4.5). This is
not an uncommon question amongst papuan languages (Blevins and Pawley,
2010; Jendraschek, 2012), and is made all the more problematic by phonemicisation choices of glides or high vowels, as demonstrated for Iatmul and
Kalam by Foley (1986, pp51–52).
19Baron (p.c.) gives several more forms in Western Momu (transcribed in the orthography used here): /fej/ ‘breast(milk)’, /aeEànej/ ‘talk secretly’, /àoànej/ ‘break up’,
/Esfej/ ‘leg’, /fEsnej/ ‘one’, /nafkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’. Many of these (non-verbal)
forms I record as long high vowels (/je/ or /wo/) rather than /ej/ or /ow/. This may
be a side eﬀect of the general flattening of the vowel space (§2.6.2). Some forms have
other diﬀerences in Eastern Momu (/Esfej/ : /Eàsje/, /nafkej/ : /nafOfkej/). Almost all
forms are verbs, and this means that the underlying form is confirmed by glide-consonant
metathesis which results in root-final glides being moved from a coda position to the onset
of a suﬃx, and separated from the diphthong (§2.5.1.1). It may be this morphophonological feature that has helped preserve this unusual diphthong in Eastern Momu in higher
frequency verbs.","[74, 75, 76]"
"201from as ‘show to’ in serialisation.
Almost all high-transitive verbs are formed by verb-forming suﬃxes that
include object cross-indexation. One notable exception is the verb as ‘show
to’.16 This verb uses prefixes to show all object person and number distinctions. However, the form of the object prefixes diﬀer from the regular object
prefixes (§6.2.2.2) in that third person singular and plural objects are crossindexed. In this section, I argue that this verb (or rather some earlier form) is
the likely genesis of object cross-indexing in Momu via a grammaticalisation
pathway that started with verb serialisation.17
Synchronically, this verb can serialise as the second verb in a trivalent
serial verb construction. In this construction, the (usually inanimate) themeobject is introduced by a ‘get’, ‘bring’ or ‘take’ verb (§13.3.3), and the
experiencer-object is introduced by as ‘show’, as in (6.27). This ordering
is compatible with the grammaticalisation of this verb as a verb-forming suffix.18 A synchronic patterning involving as ‘show’ as an initial verb is not
currently attested.
(6.27) Man pana=nis.
bag get.one=show:3plO[1|3sgS]
‘She showed the bag to them.’
There is a second related verbal number pair nafas/tyefas ‘show/reveal
one/many’. While as ‘show to’ takes a recipient object, this second verb
takes a theme object whose number is indicated by alternations in form.
This second verb clearly shows the na-/tye- transitivising prefixes (§6.6.2.2,
§6.6.2.3, §6.5.2) fused into its form. Excluding the transitivising prefixes,
*fas is not a standalone verb, but it is possible that as is a common root to
both ‘show’ verbs.
Table 6.6 compares the third person singular subject forms of the ‘show
to’ paradigm with the object prefixes (§6.2.2.2). Table 6.7 compares these
same forms for ‘show to’ with the the object cross-indexing verb-forming suffixes (§6.3.3.1). There is a striking similarity between was ‘show to me/you’
16The recipient is the cross-referenced object for as ‘show to’. The theme is oblique.
Grammaticalisation via verb serialisation is extremely common in the area. See,
for instance, the interesting case of classifiers developing from serial verbs in the nearby
Imonda language (Seiler, 1985).
18
Nominal incorporation applies here as well. The bound root combined with this verbforming suﬃx is also occasionally nominal in origin. For instance, for on/koynin ‘see
one/many’, koy ‘eye’ is clearly the nominal origin of the plural form.
17202and mas ‘show to us/you’ and the corresponding object prefixes in Table 6.6.
Similarly, compare those same forms to the corresponding verb-forming suffixes, and nis ‘show to them’ to the plural third person forms of the transitive
verb-forming suﬃxes in Table 6.7.

There are some problems that must be overcome before linking as ‘show
to’ to the object prefixes, not the least of which is that I am at present
unaware of any other languages grammaticalising ‘show’ as a means of object
marking. The source of the final segment or segments in the verb-forming
suﬃxes need to be motivated, and the loss of the final s for both the prefixes
and suﬃxes also needs to be motivated.
The deletion of s for the prefixing forms is easiest to motivate. There
is elsewhere some synchronic evidence of stem-final consonant deletion in
the context of tight serialisation (§2.5.3). Motivating the final consonant
(n or r ) in the verb-forming suﬃxes is more diﬃcult. As the source of the
object marking prefixes or as verb-forming suﬃxes, the loss of the final s
must be motivated. Instead, I appeal to more general processes applying to
compounding. The final segment may have been lost for the prefixing forms
through compounding with other verbs. Ar is a synchronic full verb ‘do to’.
This is the likely source of the r -set. As noted in §6.3.3.3, several verbs have
an as their stem-final segments. From this, I assume that there was once a
verb an. Compounding with these verbs possibly produced the verb-forming
suﬃxes.
Finally, most diﬃcult to motivate, is the overt marking of third person
203for both singular and plural number in the verb-forming suﬃxes but the lack
of overt marking for the third person in the prefixing forms. This hypothesis
requires motivating a serialisation pattern that has applied to local persons
(i.e., first and second persons) but not to third persons.
First, it must be noted that object prefixing applies variably to diﬀerent
classes of verbs. Verbs formed via an object cross-indexing verb-forming
suﬃx optionally (and redundantly) use object prefixing. Otherwise, the
prefixes are obligatory for transitive verbs but determined on a lexical basis.
These verbs all encode verbal number, which coincidentally aligns in
Momu with the preferential selection of an inanimate object—a preference
that would not require local person distinctions. Many of the verbs that take
an obligatory object prefix appear to have undergone a shift in semantics
from that which previously did not allow animate or human (and, therefore,
local) objects, to a sense that allows human referents.
The grammaticalisation pathway for the object prefixes that I propose is
therefore as follows:
1. A verbal form that selects inanimate objects expands to include human
objects
2. In order to introduce local objects, as ‘show’ was used in serialisation
as V1 with these verbs. Third person objects were acceptable, however,
and remained unmarked
3. Over time, the form reduced, with compounding reducing the form by
removing the final consonant
4. In recognising paradigmatic parallelism of the prefixes, the prefixes
came to apply optionally to verbs formed by a separate but parallel
development of verb-forming suﬃxes6.4Transitive paradigmsHaving established the various forms of argument indexation (§6.2) and the
various ways in which verbs are formed (§6.3), this section briefly exemplifies
what patterns of syncretism look like in full transitive paradigms, beginning
with typical paradigms for high- and low-transitive verbs (§6.4.1, §6.4.2).","[229, 230, 231, 232]"

"85vowels i and u are raised and merged with the long high vowels yi and wu.
Length also appears to be becoming less distinctive. This then more closely
matches the almost cardinal 5 vowel system of Tok Pisin (Smith, 2008).
This is a feature of younger speakers of Momu in Mori—particularly those
approximately 30 years old or younger.
Table 2.26 gives some examples of diﬀerences in form by my two most
conservative speakers—Yarin and Ferdi. Yarin is from Savamui village and
Ferdi is from Nebeki. Nebeki is the most centrally located of all Momu
speaking villages. Ferdi had also spent time as a young man at Amanab
station, which is further to the west and so he was well aware of Western
diﬀerences and has had contact with Momu speaking people from many
areas. I compare these to standard representations with Momu speakers
from Mori. For younger people in Savamui village, some of these forms are
the norm.

ebs(j)i [PĔàsj i ⇠ PĔàse]Table 2.26: Phonological diﬀerences between speakers
One of the most immediately notable diﬀerences is a trend away from
bilabial trills to fricatives. Older and especially male speakers consistently
trilled, while everyone else produced a fricative most of the time. Labialisation is a frequent and marked feature of Western Momu (Baron p.c.) and
is present to a degree in the speech of older speakers. In some cases, it
appears that this labialisation is an accompanying feature of some consonants—especially bilabial trills—but it is not limited to these segments.
Many of the eﬀects of the glides on neighbouring segments are lost in the
speech of younger speakers. Denasalisation, palatalisation, and labialisation
on neighbouring consonants are generally lost, and devoiced glides are lost
altogether (as in pup ‘bush knife’ in Table 2.26). Word-final glides that
“resurface” when reattaching to a following vowel-initial word are generally
lost as well for the youngest speakers but are preserved for Eastern Momu
86speakers. Observant readers may notice that forms are sometimes written
with or without glides in the remaining chapters of this thesis. This variation
in spelling is representative of speaker variation.
A handful of pairs of distinct verbs collapse with the flattening of the
vowel space. What has developed in its place is a tendency for these verbs to
be accompanied by a dummy object to preserve the diﬀerence. For instance,
consider ki ‘sleep’ and kiy ‘eat’. For those that flatten the vowel space,
these forms are homophonous. In order to diﬀerentiate them, they are nearly
always accompanied by a kind of dummy object like tyako ‘a nap’ or cognate
object like kuwu ‘food’ respectively. To contrast si ‘smell’ and siy ‘urinate’,
both are accompanied by dummy objects abka ‘sweet smell’ or fwa ‘bad
smell’ and tuk ‘bladder’ respectively.","[113, 114, 115]"
"416Chapter 13Serial Verb Constructions
Serial verb constructions (SVCs) are a commonly identified feature of many
Papuan languages (Foley, 1986; Senft, 2008), but have also been identified
in many languages all over the world (Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2006; Durie,
1997). The precise definition of an SVC varies upon consideration of the
finer details, but is generally characterised as two or more verbs occurring in
a single clause, which together describe a ‘single event’ (Aikhenvald, 2006).
Consider a gradual process of grammaticalisation that begins with the
coordination of several clauses predicated by a relatively open set of verbs.
Frequently repeated combinations of clauses, perhaps involving restricted
classes of verbs, gradually reduce in form over time. In a sequence of clauses
where the subject is held constant, subsequent clauses with zero anaphora
tend towards being just a verb, or object and verb (or verb phrase, if one
prefers). In verb-final languages like Momu, this reduction produces a stack
of verbs at the right edge of the clause with a minimal amount of material
occurring between verbs. The extreme form of this reduction is a tight
and possibly synchronically inseparable complex of verb-like morphs that
comprise a single lexeme. Existing accounts of SVCs include examples of
apparent loose coordination through to tight compounding, making this a
somewhat diﬀuse topic at times.
Momu is a language with many construction types represented across
the spectrum described above, but I do not refer to all of these constructions
as SVCs. In particular, see §7.5.2 for an example of grammaticalised or
partly grammaticalised aspectual inflections of the kind that have elsewhere
been described as SVCs. See also §14 for a more general consideration of
417compounding and coordination, which I consider outside of SVCs in Momu.
A common approach in the analysis of SVCs is to consider the overall
valence of the construction. SVCs are often analysed as cumulatively adding
participants to an event’s frame, with multiple participants taken to attain
argument-like status (e.g. Aikhenvald, 2006; Durie, 1997). However, I follow
others (e.g. Ameka, 2009; Hellwig, 2006), in considering SVCs in Momu to
be the expression of separate case frames. For discussion of participants in
SVCs see §13.3.3.
After laying out the basics to identify SVCs in Momu in §13.1, I look
at specific SVC types in §13.2. Having identified many of the SVC types, I
look more broadly at both features that are common to all SVCs in Momu,
as well as themes that run through subsets (§13.3).
All examples of SVCs throughout this chapter are in bold. Many SVCs
show final-segment deletion (§2.5.3) consistent with integration as a single
phonological word. These will be marked as proclitic, with an equals sign
(=). Because this can result in dense morphological detail, I will at times
break these apart with a space. But to be clear, this is not an indicator of a
pause or break. At other times SVCs in Momu show fewer signs of integration
as a single phonological word, but are nevertheless delivered rapidly and
without pause. I have no medial orthographic categories for marking this,
and so these are written as separate forms, and the bolding of SVCs indicate
that these are what I consider to be SVCs.","[444, 445, 446]"

The diphthongs iy and uw are a special case.26 These diphthongs occur
on only a handful of verbs, and only word-finally (outside of suﬃxing). The

Finally, there are VV diphthongs (§2.1.4), examples of which are given
in Table 2.24. The diphthong ai is broadly distributed, but the others are
less so. To my knowledge, medial oi and ui only arise due to suﬃxing.27

25Depending on the boundary and morphology applied, glides resolve in diﬀerent ways.
Deletion (§2.5.7) or metathesis (§2.5.1.1) of the glide are possible, with both strategies
functioning to preserve the more general ordering preference of CGV.
26
Recall that yi and wu are phonetically monophthongal (§2.1.4.3) while iy and uw are
diphthongs with starting points roughly around a mid to high central vowel (varying from
speaker to speaker) (§2.1.4.2).
27
Admittedly, the diﬀerence between these VV diphthongs, and the similar VG variants
is at times diﬃcult to hear, and so the distribution may be broader than I have concluded.","[82, 83]"
