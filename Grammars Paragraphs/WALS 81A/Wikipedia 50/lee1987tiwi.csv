Often where the re is a change o f theme , particularly whe re the re i s s ome

3 . 3 . 2 . 2 , p . 1 0 7 ) , of ten with a more specif i c refe rence f o l l owing l a t e r in t he

Thi s often occurs whe re the action of the verb is the same as in the

' pass ive ' par t icipant becomes an 'active ' one , i . e . an obj e c t becomes a

TT ) , when the subj e c t is marked on the ve rb . When there is an ove rt subj e c t in
the clause , the unmarked order is SP , though this order may be reversed . The
reason f o r revers ing the order has not been s tudied in detail but it would seem
in gene ral that the subj e c t fol lowing the ve rb is e i the r new info rma t i on or old
informa t ion re-introduced ( see 6 . 8 . 2 , p . 2 9 3 for further d i scus s i on ) . When
there is no bound subj ect on the verb , an ove r t subj ect is required , except
und e r certain cond i t ions for de let ion of the subj ect , such as in a purpose
clause ( see 6 . 9 . 6 , p . 30 2 ) , and the o rder always seems to be rigidly SP .
The o p t i onal a rguments (non-core ) , which may occur in intran s i t ive clauses
in MT are : Bene f a c t ive / Purpose ( B/Pur ) , Accompaniment (Accomp ) , Vehi cle ( Veh ) ,
Ind i r e c t Obj e c t ( 10 ) and Ins trument ( In ) . The occur rence of some of the se
depeRd s . �pon. the seman t i c s of the verb .

( indicat ing mo t ion ' t o ' or mot i on ' f rom' with verbs of mo t i on ) , may a l so occur
( see 6 . 2 . 3 , p . 2 6 0 ) .
The locat ive lateral con s t i tuent and the non-core arguments norma l l y
f o l low t h e verb , b u t t h e o r d e r may vary . When t h e order i s SP the subj e ct and
predicate are no t normally separated except by a nega t i ve ( see 6 . 6 , p . 28 7 ) or a
manne r word ( see 6 . 2 . 3 . 3 , p . 2 63 ) . There are normally no more than two

A semi-t ransi t ive clause i s one wi th a ve rb requiring two nominal
arguments , the S and SO ( Secondary Obj e ct ) but the SO is not marked on the
ver b , except pe rhaps by an incorporated f o rm ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 2 ) , p . 1 60 ) ( i . e . i t
is not marked b y a personal pre f ix ) . Mos t verb s tems take gene ral
subj e c t -tense pref ixes but a small class o f verb s tems occurring in
semi-trans i t i ve verbs take the feminine subj ec t -tense prefixe s , as in example
6-4 8 ( a ) ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 1 ) , p . 1 5 7 , and Table 4 . 5 , p . 1 7 3 ) .
The d i s cuss ion regarding the order of the arguments in re l a t i on to the

If the SO i s

The SO i s normal ly inanimate , while the S is animat e , often having the

are ind i cated .
In TT , they are defined by cross -re fe rencing ( o r the lack of
i t ) to verbal a f f ixes , whi l e in MT, they a re mainly defined syntact ically by
word order and /or by the marking of the NP in the clause by a prepos i t ion ( o r
t h e lack o f s u c h marking ) .
In MT , the unmarked NPs a re d i s t inguished
synt a c t ically and seman t i c a l l y .
In more formal MT , the subj ect may be
d e t e rmined as in TT , i . e . by cross-refe rence with the subj e ct-tense prefix in
the verb .
In Casual MT , it is mainly d i s t inguished by pos i t ion and
semant i c a l l y ( see a l s o 6 . 8 , p . 29 1 , re word order in the clause ) .
The re i s no one -to-one correspondence between the con s t i tuents o f the
clause in TT and MT . The correspondences be tween the two a re shown in Table

'we should cause them to bathe'The order of the morphemes re tained in the speech of young people , though
with changed f orms in some cases , i s given in Table 4 . 4 ( cf . Table 4 . 3 ) . Some
o f the se morpheme s , part icularly those given in parenthese s , do not occur very
often in the MT data and when they do occur it i s usually in fairly formal
speech ( such as e l i c i tation ) . For this reason many of the forms can probably
be regarded as a style closer to trad i t i onal Tiwi ( i . e . a LTT style ) . The only
a f fixes which occur with any regularity in MT are the subj ect-tense prefixes ,
the durat ive aspe c t , the emphat i c prefix and the conne c t i ve s . As has been
pointed out e a r l ie r , a basic charact e r i s t i c of MT i s the use of the verbal
complex con s t ruction rather than the independent inf lected verb and so the use
o f verb s tems ( o the r than the auxi liary verb s tem
see 4 . 3 . 2 . 2 , p . 2 l 3 ) is
also ind i c a t ive of an LTT style rather than MT .-mi ,In the fol lowing sub-sect ions the morphemes are not d i s cussed in the order
of the i r occurrence in the verb but in the i r grammat i cal categorie s . The
nucleus of the verb is d i scussed f i r s t , then the subj ect-tense prefixe s , d i re ct
and ind i re c t obj e c t prefixes , locat ive and stance prefixes , temporal prefixe s ,
the emphatic pre f i x , voice suf fixes , aspect affixes and mood prefixes .
In each
case , the forms occurring in TT are di scussed fol lowed by the changes apparent
in MT .","[162, 163, 164]"

phrase or clause , or by a group noun. 4 There may be other types of phrases and
clauses which may occur in thi s posit ion ( such as tempora l ) but which are not
apparent in my dat a . There are no examples of manner clauses occurring in this
pos i t ion in MT .
The head is given as opt ional , in that it need no t be present in the

they modi f y or refer to ( see 3 . 2 . 1 , p . 7S ) , except f o r the manner and locat ive
phrases and clauses , and Engl ish loan nouns used as adj ect ives , as in example
5- 1 ( d ) . Re lat ive clauses are normally int roduced by relative pronouns which
agree in gender or numb e r with the noun to which they re f e r ( see 3 . 3 . 3 ) . The re
are some cases whe re there are clauses which behave as relative clause s , in
that they are closely associated with a head noun , modifying i t , but which do
not have any relat ive pronoun , as in example 5- 1 ( j ) .","[229, 230]"

analogy .
( 4 ) The regular i s a ti on of the three sets of subj ect -tense prefixe s of TT to the
one of MT is typical of the regularisa tion which occurs in normal language
change .
Other changes have to be more directly att ributed to extensive contact
with Engl ish and / o r Pidgin English ( to direct borrowing f rom them or to
analogical mod e l l ing on s t ructures within them ) .
The se change s , although given under the separate headings of Phonol ogy ,
Word classes , Clauses e tc . , are not discrete changes occurring independently of
each othe r . Change in the lexi con , through borrowing , introduces new phones or
phonemes into the language , leading to an expans ion in the phoneme inventor y .
There i s a corre sponding reduc t ion in the phoneme inventory through the loss of
some TT phonemes ( see 2 . 7 ) .
The se changes appear to be going on simultaneous ly. With the change in
culture , children and young people have had less exposure to the 'pure ' f o rm of
the language and so hear fewer occurrences of the sounds which are being
changed . Many young people seem to be aware of the ' prope r ' pronunc i a t i ons and
some t imes use them in the i r more formal speech or in writ ing . However , the i r
casual speech doe s not seem to b e affected by this awareness and many who a re
able to wri t e have d i f f i culty in spell ing words with post -alveolar consonants
In material wri t ten by young people there are a
and the ve lar f r i ca tive .
numbe r of examples of hype rcorre c t i o n , in which words are spe lt with
pos t -alveolar consonants whe re they do not occur in TT .
On the surface , it is not clear whe ther the int roduction of Engl ish loan
free form verbs has led to the loss of TT verb stems or vice ve rsa , or whe ther
the l o s s o f the TT ve rbal inf l e c t i ons has led to more grammat i cal r e l a t i ons
being ind i cated by nouns or preposi t ional phrases and to tense , mood and aspect
being s hown by separate words , or the o ther way around , or whe ther the changes
have been simu lt aneous .
The re seems to be a 'vicious circle ' ope rat ing . As more Eng l i s h loan
verbs are int roduced mo re verb stems a re los t , and as more verb stems a re l o s t
more Eng l i s h loan ve rbs a r e int roduce d .
Similarl y , a s the verb inf lection is
l o s t , the more rigid become s the word order as grammat i cal relati ons a re shown
by noun or prepos i t ional phrases . Also as more prepos i t i ons are int roduced or
the functions of exi s t ing p repq s i t i ons are expanded the more inf l e c t i on is l o s t
f rom t h e ve r b .
Both the l o s s o f some TT verb stems and the use o f Engl ish loan verbs are
Simi l a rly ,
apparent in the speech of middle-aged ( and even some olde r ) people .
some loss of verbal inf lect ion and the extension of the meanings of TT locat ive
prepos i t i ons have also been noted in the i r speech . The extent of these t r a i t s
has no t been s tudied i n detail .
MT is characte rised by the almost complete loss of TT verb stems and
verbal inf l e c t ions and by much l anguage 'mixing ' , wi th e lements derived from
both TT and Engl ish ( and /or Pidgin Engl i sh ) . MT seems to be an amalgamation of
TT and Eng l i s h . 5323
The que s t ion arises whe the r MT has developed f r om the speech of
middle-aged people through a process of language 'deat h ' , with the change s
being carried to a n ext reme and thus ne c e s s i t a t ing extensive borrowing , o r
whe the r i t has developed i n another way ( i . e . whe ther MT is a reduced or
s i mpl i f ied form of TT through gradual loss and repl acement by English , or
whe ther i t i s in fact an emerging new code deve loped from an ang l i c i s e d baby

"4.2THE IBFLECTED VERBThere are a numbe r of gramma t i c a l relat ions and concepts expre ssed in the
TT inflected ve r b . The basic ones are : subj ect pe rson , d i re c t or ind i re c t
obj ect person , tense , aspe c t , mood , voice , time of day , empha s i s , pos i t i on ( in
space of t ime ) /d i re c t i on . Throughout this s e c ti on the d i s cus s i on deals wi th
the inf lected verb in general , both the independent and the auxi l i ary forms .
The analys i s of the TT verb fairly closely f o l lows that of Osborne
( 1 9 7 4 : Chapter 3 ) , but with some mod i f i c a t i ons and changes in te rminol ogy .
All verbs are minima l ly marked for subj e c t person and number ( and gender
for third person singula r ) and for tense or mood . Tran s i t ive verbs are also
marked f o r d i r e c t obj e c t person and number ( and gender for thi rd person
s ingula r ) .
All othe r categories in the TT verb occur as they are required by the
semant i c s or context . The d i scus sion of the various categories and relat ions

requi red in the transit ive clause A and 0 , whe re A is the trans i t ive subj ect
and 0 i s the trans i t ive obj ect . 4 In TT , S and A fall togethe r and are denoted
by S . Ne i ther have case-marking and they cannot be d i s t inguished by word order
d i f f e rences ( see 6 . 8 , p . 29 1 ) . Moreove r , they are normally encoded on the verb
by the same set o f prefixes ( see 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 , p . 1 7 2 ) . Thi s i s another feature in
which Tiwi differs f rom mos t Aus tral ian language s , particularly Pama-Nyungan
languages ( Dixon 1 980 : 28 6 ) . The term S refers to the nominal a rgument required
in a l l verbal clauses and which i s encoded in the ve rb by the f i rs t and se cond
pref ixes ( see Table 4 . 3 , p . 1 5 2 ) . Thi s app l i e s to those clauses whi ch require
j us t one nominal a rugment ( v i z . act ive int rans i t ive clauses and s t a t ive verbal

In the l a t t e r case the same verbal subj e c t pref ixes are used
as in act ive clauses (see 6 . 4 . 1 , p . 2 83 , and also 6 . 5 . 1 , p . 28 5 ) . The re seems no
reason to call this nominal argument by another term.
In the non-verbal clauses the subj e c t may be manif e s ted by an expanded NP ,

The 1 0 i s the nominal argument to whi ch the 10 pref i xes on the ve rb re f e r
( 4 . 2 . 3 , p . 1 7 9 ) . 5 Although ' indirect obj e c t ' i s used here , the sense s in which
it is used in TT are much wider than those normally covered by the term. The
10 may encode bene fact ive (as in example 6-5 ( a » , purpose (as in example
6-5 ( b » , the addressee with certain verbs of speech ( 6- 5 ( c » , the patient
( 6- 5 ( d ) and ( e » , or the person talked about ( 6-5 ( f » .
The 10 in TT appears to cover a similar range of funct ions as both the

languages the se are separate but in others they fall together ( Dixon
1 9 7 2 : 1 4 6- 1 4 7 ; 1 980 : 2 9 7 f f ; McKay 1 9 7 5 ; Cape ll 1 9 5 6 : 7 7 f ; Hudson 1 9 7 8 : 24f ) .
The 1 0 prefix i s often the only ind i cat ion of the presence of an 1 0 in the
clause , but there may be an ove rt express ion of the 10 in the clause as we l l
and /or a n incorporated form i n the nucleus o f the verb ( see 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 2 ) , p . 1 60 ) .
Al though bene fac tive and purpose are not normally arguments of the ve rb
( cf . Dixon 1 9 80 : 29 7 f ) , they are cons idered as such in TT , since , when they are
present in a clause they are cross-referenced to the ve rb , with the 10 prefix
ind i cat ing person and number ( and , in the case of third s ingular pe rson ,
gende r , see Table 4 . 8 , p . 1 80 ) . Here 'benefactive ' and ' purpos e ' are semantic
te rms and '10' i s the syntactic term. The beginning of a change is d i s cussed

"5. 1HOUR PHRASESNPs in Tiwi are not as close kni t as English NP s , in tha t the order of the
cons t i tuents may vary and may even be di scont inuous , i . e . with elements of the
phrase being separated by othe r clause e lement s .
The reason for the reorde ring
of element s has not been s tudied in de tai l , but it would seem that elements
which are in focus are often f ronted in the phrase ( see also 6 . 8 , p . 29 l ) . 35. 1 . 1AlTRIBUTlVE HOUR PHRASESThe s t ructure of the a t t r ibutive NP i s ba s i cally the same in all styles
and code s o f Tiwi , but with some var i a t i ons as to what can occur in each s l o t .
The basic s t ructure and orde ring of the a t t r i butive NP is given in Table 5 . 1 .
The a t t r i butive NP cons i s t s o f an opt i onal head noun and norma lly no mo re

the most common orde r ) are : Limi ter (Lim ) , mani f e s t e d by the limi t ing

"2and ind i re c t obj ect , tense , aspec t , mood , t ime of day and location . There may
also be incorporated f orms in the verb which may be e i the r nominal or ve rbal in
char ac t e r . The se forms are different f rom the corre sponding free form nouns
and verbs . ( See also Cape l l 1 9 6 7 : 43 . )

In the i r speech mos t
of the verbal inflect ion i s lost , with periphras t i c , analy t i c ve rb fo rms
replacing the complex inf lec ted verbs . The language has become mainly
i s o l a t ing . Non-ve rbal concepts which are expressed in the verb in the

by a free form word (a noun , pronoun , adverb , locative or time word ) . Thi s is

In example ( 1-2 ) , the word s , japinari 'morning '

I t would seem that the mascul ine d e f ini tive has been reduced in order to

WORD CLA S S E S3. 1IRTRODUCTIONTradit ional Tiwi has a number of word classes or parts of speech , some of
which may be divided into sub-clas ses . The way in which the se a re classi f i ed
and named differs f rom Osbo rne in some cases ( 1 9 7 4 : 58-5 9 ) and bas i c a l l y follows
Dixo n ' s categories for mos t Aus tral ian languages ( Dixon 1 9 80 : 2 7 1 ) . The two
maj o r word classes are nomina l s , subdivided into nouns , kin nouns , adj e c t i ves
and numerals , and verbals subdivided into inflected verbs and free form verbs .
Othe r full word classes are predicatives , loca t i ves , tempora l s , adverbs ,
p a r t i c l e s and interj e c t i ons . The function word classes a re pronominals ,
prepos i t ions , sentence int roduce rs and conjunc t ions .
The classes and sub-classes are d e t e rmined on syntac t i c , morphological and
seman t i c ground s . Verbal construct ions in both MT and TT are de scribed .
Prepo s i t ions are d i s cussed briefly in Chapte r 4 and Chapte r 5 ( Clauses ) .
Conj unc t ions and sent ence int roducers are not d i s cussed in the work .
The catego r i e s for Modern Tiwi are , in gene ra l , the same as tho se for
Trad i t ional Tiwi , the main d i fferences be ing within the classes or sub-classe s .
Some classe s , such a s inf lected verbs , are much reduced i n s i z e , while othe r
classe s , such as free ve rbs , are expanded .","[84, 85]"

forming more complex sentences .
There are a numbe r o f cases o f subordinate
clause s in TT expres sing d i f ferent re lationships . The subordina t ing s t rategy
used in Tiwi i s that of a subordinat ing conj unc t ion and a clause with a f ini te
ve rb . Glass has found tha t this seems to be the mos t common s t rategy in
Aus t ral ian prefixing languages (Glass 1 980 : 8 ) . The bas i c subordinate
conj unc t i ons i n TT are karri 'when' , expre s s ing a temporal relationship ( 6 . 9 . 3 ,
p . 29 9 ) , pili 'be caus e ' express ing reason ( 6 . 9 . 5 , p . 30 l ) , pili ngini ' in order
to ' , expre s s ing purpose ( 6 . 9 . 6 , p . 30 2 ) and ngini which i s a general subordinate
conj unct ion and complemen t i s e r ( COMPR) ( see 6 . 9 . 7 , p . 304 ) . As wel l as the se ,
the re l a t ive pronouns ( 3 . 3 . 3 , p . 1 1 3 ) and prepo s i t ions ( d is cussed in 5 . 2 , p . 2 3 5 )
may b e used a s subordinate conj unct ions ( see 6 . 9 . 1 ; 6 . 9 . 3 , p . 299 and 6 . 9 . 4 ,
p . 3 00 ) .
Some of the claus es d i s cussed below could be called 'adj o ined relat ive
clause s ' ( pa r t i cularly those with the complementiser ngini ) s ince the i r surface
pos i t i ons with respe c t to the main clause s are marginal rather than embedded
( Ha l e 1 9 7 6 : 7 8 ) . Howeve r , othe r s , such as the re l a t ive clauses (which do have
d i s tinct relat ive pronouns , see 6 . 9 . 1 . 1 ) are embedded within other clause s and
so are d e f ini t e l y subordina t e . Al s o , s ince none of the c lauses d iscus sed be low
can s t and alone as a main clause they a re called ' subordina te ' .
In MT , some o f the se conj unc t i ons are used , but in gene ral the re i s l e s s

complexity of the TT inf lected ver b , the meanings expre ssed by the l o s t verbal
aff ixes need to be conveyed in s ome o ther way . The meanings expressed b y s ome
mood and aspect affixe s are given by aspect words borrowed from Eng l i sh ( or
perhaps from Pidgin Engl i sh ) .
Two words which commonly occur are : sat/stat ' s tart to ' , replac ing the TT
incept ive prefix ( see 4 . 2 . 8 . 1 , p . 1 90 ) and tra/tray ' try to ' , replacing the TT
f rus t rative prefix ( see 4 . 2 . 9 . 1 , p . 1 95 ) .
These words occur before an inf lected
independent verb o r before the free f o rm verb ( e i ther alone or in a verbal
complex ) . 7 5

'He looked around in vain for those other men .
( RJ 1 2 )Another aspect o r tense word , pin 'past , ' occurs only before a free form
verb without an auxi l i a r y , s ince tense is marked on the auxiliary.
Thi s is
used qui te commonly in Chi l d ren ' s Tiwi and in casual Modern Tiwi . 7 7

The se aspe c t words ( and othe r s ) are used in creole languages in Aus t ralia .
In Kriol they appear to be used in the same way , i . e . preced ing the verb

There are one or two tag que s t ions which e i ther do not occur in TT or
whi ch seem to have a dif fe rent meaning . One such tag is wayana? (waya ' now' +
-ana Q? ) , whi c h Godfrey says occurs in TT as meaning 'Do you now understand ? ' .
I t may have this meaning in some o f the ins tances in the MT data , but often i t
j us t seems to b e used much as the t a g que s t i on i s u s e d in English , to evoke a

i n the clause in T T and the o r d e r is rel a tively f re e . The unmarked orde r i s
S P O whe re 0 refers t o e i the r the d i r e ct or se condary obj e c t ( see the d i scussion
in Osbo rne 1 9 7 4 : 62 f ) . Var i a t i ons from this order are due to d i s course
considerat ions , a full d i scussion of which i s outside the scope of this work .
In gene ra l , the ordering can be looked at in te rms of ' theme ' meaning roughly
' the thing be ing talked about ' , as sugge sted by Osbo rne ( 1 9 7 4 : 62 ) . Osbo rne
says that the ' t heme always comes f i r s t in a sentence , regard l e s s of i ts292
synt a c t i c func t ion' ( 62 ) . Thi s , in gene ra l , would s e e m to b e true b u t the
s i tuation i s a l i t tle more complex than this statement imp l ie s . Of ten when a
topic is being int roduced for the f i r s t t ime it occurs in the theme pos i t ion ,
as in example 6- 1 0 1 though normally new informa t i on is not ini t i a l in the
clause or sentence . 4 7

we : would : make : camp' (We would walk in the morning when everyone else was a s leep ) then at
Pipiyanyumi l i , there we would make camp . '
New info rmat ion norma l l y occurs fina l l y , o r near final l y , in the clause
and this new info rmat ion can then become the theme of the next clause . 48

1 9 7 9 : 65-67 ) .
54 . Although inte raction with ( s lightly olde r ) pee r s has been shown to be an
i mportant factor in child language ( Baron 1 9 7 7 : 38 ) , there must be a l ink to
the adult model somewhere along the l ine , since , in mos t normal language
l e arning s i tua t i ons , chi ldren ' s speech does come to approximate adul t
speech. Though there may b e s l ight changes from gene ration to generation.
55. There would probably have been a baby talk version of Tiwi which has

where chi ldren have only been exposed to the i r own or another language by
watching TV they do not pick i t up . For ins tance , Snow ( 1 9 7 6 ) and he r
colleagues , found that Dutch children cons tantly watching Ge rman televis ion

5 7 . See Chapter 1 , note 19 ( p . 1 8 ) .
5 8 . Some of these features shared with Pidgin English and creoles are :

Some verbs wi th -im

cf . MT : kipim 'give ' with Kr iol : gibit

'give ' , gibim 'kee p ' ( Sandefur and Sandefur 1 9 7 9 ) . Also kreshim ' crash
( t r ) ' i s a recent word .
( i i ) Some words in MT are obvious ly borrowed from Pidgin Engl ish e . g .
or sapi 'know ' , kiyemin ' l i e , dece ive , pretend ' .japi ,365
( i i i ) The suffix -pal a on the end of s ome adj ectives seems to be a
borrowing from Pidgin Engl ish e . g . panupala ' funny ' . However in these
cases the whole word appears to be borrowed ( not many examp le s ) and new
words are re plac ing the m , of ten with the suf f i x -wan , e . g . faniwan ' funny ' .
( iv ) The use of the aspect wo rds pin 'pas t ' , sat/stat ' s tar t ' , tra/tray
' t ry ' . The f i r s t of the se is clearly borrowed from Pidgin Eng l i sh and also
occurs in TE .
I am not sure about the l a t t e r two .
They appear to have
arisen independently of Pidgin English inf luence .
Other aspect words or
auxi liary verbs which are used in Kriol and o ther creole languages a re not
used in MT ( su ch as , gona 'will ' ; labda mas 'mus t ' , yusda 'used t o ' ; cf .
Sande fur 1 9 7 9 : 1 2 6 ) .
( v ) There are also some features of the 'bas i le c t ' of TE in common with
Pidgin Eng l i sh , par t i cularly as i t i s used by older people , v i z . the use of
the gene ral prepo s i t ion long( a ) and the posse s s ive prepo s i t i on play/pla

I have not s tudied TE in suf f i cient detail to dete rmine the
ove rall relation of the 'bas i le c t a l ' form wi th Pidgin Eng l i s h .

important and wish it to be taught in the schoo l .
The se older people are proud
o f the i r ident i ty as Tiwi . Michael Sims ( a p r i e s t who spent some years at
Ngu i u ) says ( 19 7 8 : 1 6 7 ) :
The Tiwi people have always shown themse lves a s t rong
v i r i l e people , proud of the trad i t ions of the i r ances tors .
Today the i r sel f-rel iance is becoming evident as they
address themse lve s t o advanced policies in Aboriginal
mat te r s , dictated by governmental demand s . The i r s trength
i s shown in wanting to decide the ir own future a f t e r

are unwi l l i ng to lose the i r t rue iden t i ty as a Tiwi people .
Mos t young people wish to retain the Tiwi language but not the ' hard '

The re are
seems to be a r e f l e c t i on o f the i r d e s i re to be identi f i e d as Tiwi .
some young people who would like to be able to und e r s t and and speak 'hard ' Tiwi
and make an e f f o r t t o do so but this is not a gene ral trend .
The maintenance of the Tiwi language and othe r Abor i g inal languages has
been encouraged in recent years by the change in government policy towards
them, as in the int roduction of bil ingual educa tion in some school s and the
t rans lat ion of some government pamphle t s . The effect of the bil ingual
p rogramme a t Nguiu on the Tiwi language and i t s maintenance is unclear at
present .
S ince many of those involved in the programme (both European and
Tiwi ) ins i s t upon 'puri ty' , particularly in the writ ten form, this may tend to
s t i f le the deve lopment of the language , as anything less pure may be seen to be
a corrupt form. Mos t of the Tiwi teache r s and a i des in the school a re not
t radi t i onal speakers thems e lves and s o the s tyle actually used in mo s t of
l i t e rature is a simpli f i e d TT , without incorporated forms in the ve rb or the
mo re complex mood and aspect aff ixes ( as mo s t of the material is narrative ) .
The use of loan words for which the re i s no Tiwi equivalent i s cons ide red
acceptable but not the Engl ish loans in MT verbal complexe s . The programme
onl y goes so far and it would seem that children are then expected to deve lop
the more complex verbal aff ixe s and forms as be s t they can , out of school or
when they leave school .
I be l i eve that a standardised verbal sys tem mode lled along the l ines of TT
i s an unre a l i s t i c goal to be aimed at by the teaching of a t radi ti onal language
or a simp l i f i e d version of i t , that the speech of young people wil l move
further away f rom TT because this is seen as una ttainabl e . Howeve r , if t he MT
verbal system is all owed to develop naturally and is accepted , I be l ieve that
the language may s t ab i l i s e , pa r t i cularly with emphas i s in the l i terature and
teaching on the use of other TT par t s of speech which are not una t tainable and
which wi l l help to prese rve the ident i ty of the language as Tiwi .
At thi s s tage i t is unclear what dire c t ion Tiwi wi l l take , whe the r MT wi l l
stabi l i se , w i t h pe rhaps a formal style of M T moving c l o s e r to T T o r to
simp li f ied TT , because of the inf luence of the bilingual programme in the
s choo l , or whe the r MT and TE wi l l converge completely or pe rhaps be mo re
s t rongly inf l uenced by a mainland creole language . Thi s l a t t e r may occur as
there i s mo re and more contact with mainland Abori gines and i f the need to be360identif ied as Abo riginal , rathe r than Tiwi , emerges ( through the na t ional
Aboriginal movement ) .
It may be that in the three separate commun i t i e s of
Nguiu , Pu1arumpi and Mi1ikapi t i , diffe rent s i tuations may deve lop . Only t ime
wi l l t e l l whe the r Tiwi wi l l die out completely or remain as a living l anguage ,

( 1 ) Dorian has discussed some ways i n which the speech o f semi-speake rs o f
Suthe rland Gae l i c (ESG) i s aber rant f rom that of fluent speake r s , such a s :
( i ) some loss of gender dis tincti ons ( Dorian 1 9 7 6 , 1 98 1 a : 1 24- 1 2 9 ,
147-148 ) ;
( i i ) some loss of case marking but with the semantic not ions being shown
in othe r ways , such as by prepositi onal phrases 3 9 ( Dorian 1 9 7 3 : 426-4 3 5 ,
1 98 1 a : 1 2 9-1 3 6 , 1 48 ) ;
( ii i ) reduc ti on of the tense system with no tendency to subst i tute
adverbial t ime marke rs ( Do rian 1 98 1 a : 1 38-14 1 , 1 50- 1 5 1 ) ;
( iv ) lo s s of on'e type o f pas s i ve ( Dorian 1 9 7 3 : 42 1 -4 2 6 ; 1 98 1 a : 1 42 - 1 44 ) ;
( v ) reduct i on of the lexi con , though a considerable number of ESG words
are re ta ined even by those who are unable to use them in a Gae l i c sentence
( Dorian 1 98 1 a : 1 4 5 - 1 4 6 ) . 40345She says
( 2 ) Do rian has said l i t tle about the interference of Eng l i sh on ESG.
( 1 980c : 25 ) that she has been surprised by how l i t t le s t ructural inte rfe rence
f rom Eng l i s h there is in the speech of semi -speakers . There i s a considerable
amount of lexical inte rfe rence but in this the more common s t rategy i s for
Engl ish l oans to be adapted t o Gae l i c morphology and morphophonol ogy ( Do rian
1 9 8 1 a : l 00 ) . Even in casual speech in which there i s a gre a t e r use of loan
wo rds , this is the case ( 1 9 8 1 a : l 0 l ) .
The use of loan words seems to vary from case to case in language deat h .
I n s ome cases there seem t o b e few loan words used , a s i n Nez Perce ( Aoki
1 9 7 1 ) ; and Kil iwa (Mixco 1 9 7 7 ) .
In other cases the use of loans i s ve r y common
and is seen as be ing tied up with the death of the language , as in We l sh
dialects ( B rea tnach 1 9 64 ) ; Tlaxclan Nahua t l (Hill and H i l l 1 9 7 7 ) ; Shoshoni
(Mi l l e r 1 9 7 1 ) ; Ormuri and Paraci (Ki e f f e r 1 9 7 7 ) and Arvanit ika ( Trud g i l l 1 9 7 7 ) .
Dorian ( 1 980c : 2 5 ) has noted that many accounts of languages that a re
facing extinction do s t r e s s the inf luence of the dominant language on the dying
language ( f o r ins tance , Cos t e l l o ' s ( 1 9 7 8 ) account of Pennsylvanian German ) .
( 3 ) Dre s s le r ( 1 9 7 2 ) , on studying the phonological change in Bre ton in a part of
Lowe r-Bri t t any , concluded tha t :
( i ) An optional rule in the speech of an older gene ration is l o s t in the
d i sintegrat ing speech of a younger gene ra t ion ( 1 9 7 2 : 4 5 2 ) .
( i i ) The gradual l o s s of words ( ' lexical fading ' ) in which a phonological
rule occurs results in the eventual loss of the rule i t s e l f ( 1 9 7 2 : 45 2 ) .
( i i i ) 'Uncer tainty in the competence of one language does not nece s s a r i l y

( 4 ) H i l l ( 1 9 7 3 , 1 9 7 8 ) has found in he r study of the Cupeno and Lui seno
languages of Cal i fornia that a l i ngui s t i c feature accompanying the reduct i on in

She
c i t e s various l ingu i s t s who have f ound this phenomenon in o ther cases involving
reduction of funct ion or language death (Hill 1 9 7 3 : 46-7 ) . 4 1
( 5 ) Trudgil l ( 1 9 7 7 ) has l ooked a t the types of proce s s e s involved i n the
changes in Arvani tika , an Albanian dialect in Greece , which appears to be a
dying language . He has l ooked at the changes in re l a t i on to t he proce s s e s
involved in othe r mixed languages , particularly creo le s . H e has label led wha t
i s happening in Arvani t ika as 'creolisat i on in reve r se ' , t he sociol inguis t i c
j us t i f i ca t ion f o r this being that the si tuation dea l t with involves the ' lo s s
o f i t s native speake r s , b y a language ' whe reas creol i s a t i on involves the
'acqui s i t i on of nat ive speakers by a language ' ( Trud gi l l 1 9 7 7 : 33 ) ( c f . Sankoff
and Laberge 1 9 7 4 ) . He considers a number of types of grammatical changes in
the language to dete rmine whe ther 'creolisat ion in reve r se ' is an appropr iate346
t e rm lingui s t i cally as wel l . MUhlhHus ler ( 1 9 7 4 ) has shown that the four
feature s : reduc tion ( o r impove rishment ) , simp l i f i cat ion , s tabil i ty and
uninte l l i g i b i l i ty 42 can be used in the typological clas s i f i ca t ion of vari ous
kinds o f mixed languages . He says ( 1 980 : 2 1 ) :
Reduction in s tructure or impoverishment comprises those
proce s s e s that lead to a decrease in the referential or
non-re f e rential potential of a language .
Simp l i f i ca t i on
means that a language i s made e i ther more regular or l e s s
marked .
Using the se features , a creole is characterised by simpl i f icat ion ,
s tabi l i t y and unint e l l i gi bi l i t y . Trudg i l l ' s initial hypothe s i s is that
Arvan i t ika will display reduction but no t the othe r three . He says ( 1 9 7 7 : 35 )
that Arvan i t ika :
is uns table in that it is in a state of considerable flux ,
with no real norms f o r usage
[ and )
i t remains to a
certain extent mutually inte l l igible wi�h Albanian .
• • •• • •Howeve r , he has shown that , al though the re are some clear examp l es of
reduction ( the loss of re l a t i onal words and the loss of the impe rfec t ) , other
changes involve simp l i f i cation in one component of the language with
compensa t i on elsewhe re (which he cal l s ' si mp l i f i ca t ion with cost ' ) . The se are
cases of the replacement o f synthe t i c forms by analyt i c forms . There are a l so
cases of overall simp l i f i cation viz . cases of the loss of syntagmatic
redundancy , such as the loss of the definite connect ing part i c le s . Howeve r , he
notes ( 1 9 7 7 : 4 7 ) tha t :
there are no examples of the los s of paradigma t i c
In Arvani t ika the three
redundancy commonplace in pidgins .
genders remain d i s t inct , 43 as do the separate declens ions
and conj uga t i ons .
Irregular verbs and plural forma t i ons
also remain ir regular .
I am not convinced that all the changes which Trudgi l l d i s cusses are due
to language 'death ' . As Dorian pointed out , the types of changes she found are
s imi l a r to those in 'healthy ' languages . Trudg i l l compares present-day
Arvan i t ika with modern Albanian .
It seems tha t Arvanit ika is spoken by
des cendent s of Albanians who immigrated to Greece mainly in the 1 1 th and 1 5 th
centuri e s . Many of the changes Trudg i l l di scusses could have occurred as
It
normal language changes throughout a long period of s table b i l ingua l i s m .
seems that a more rapid shi f t i s taking place now as olde r speaker s tend to use
Arvan i t ika for mos t purposes , while as Trudgi l l says ( 1 9 7 7 : 38 ) :
middle-aged speake rs and younger adul t s indulge in a
cons ide rable amount of switching accord ing to factors such
as formality , locati on , subj ect-ma t te r , the pre sence of
outsiders and the lingu i s t i c abi l ity of interlocutors .
He may have obtained d i f f e rent resu l t s if he had compared the speech of
younger people wi th that of older ones , as Dori an did .
( 6 ) Aus t i n ( 1 98 1 ) describes briefly the changes in three Eas t e rn Aus t ralian
language s . In two of these , Gami laraay and Dharawa l , the re are no l onger
f luent speakers , knowledge of the language con s i s t ing of some word s and a few347
set expre s s i ons or sentences .
In Gamilaraay basi c a l l y only certain fixed forms
of words are remembered and as it ' i s presently spoken has no syntac t i c
features which diffe rentiate it f rom Engl i s h ' ( ib id : 25 ) . Ngiyambaa i s more
actively controlled with a small speech communi tv rangin� from fluent speakers
to those who know only some word s . 4 4 In the Ngiyambaa of younger speakers , some
case inf lect ions and inf lected ve rbs are retained , though the re is a collaps ing
and reanalys i s of some case suffixe s and ve rb conj uga t ions . A phonological
change common to Gamilaraay and Ngiyambaa i s the loss of distinction be tween
the two rho t i c s r and rr , inf luenced by Engl ish .
In Gami laraay the re i s a
re tention of the lamino-dental stop , which is also noted in other languages .
One syntac t i c change no ted by Donaldson for Ngiyambaa ' il l u s t ra t e s replacement
of a synthe t i c , morphologically complex construct ion by a simpler anal ytical
one ' (Aus t in 1980 : 26 ) . 45
( 7 ) In summari s ing the changes in language death Dre s s le r and Wodak-Leodol t e r
( 1 9 7 7 : 8 7 ) say :
Language death the ref ore can be looked at as a sort of
pidgini sat ion : obligatory rules change to variable one s ;
the polys t y l i sm o f a normal language moves t o monostylism.
Howeve r , Dorian ( 1 9 7 8a : 60 6 ) has found tha t the changes in ESG are rio t
ind i cative of pidgini s a t i o n .
Radical morphological simp l i f i cat ion as found in many
pidgins i s not charac t e r i s t i c of E S G , even among the mos t
hal ting speakers , even ve ry ne ar the point of extincti o n .
From mos t o f the se s tudi e s o n l anguage death i t seems , as Dorian
( 1 98 1 a : 1 5 1 ) concluded , that there is basically no d i f fe rence be tween the types
of change in 'dying ' languages and those found in 'healthy ' language s . The
d i f f e rence is probably more in the amount of change ( in a relat ively short time
span ) . 468.2.3.2CllABGES III TIWI III llELATIOH TO LANGUAGE DumSome of the changes in Tiwi can be seen to be simi lar to those desc ribed
for various language death si tua tions and , as already menti oned , are therefore
no d i f f e rent f rom normal language change ( see Chap ter 7 for a summary of the
change s ) .
( 1 ) Phono logical change s
As in Ngiyambaa and Gamilaraay ( Austin 1 98 1 ) , the d i s t inction be tween the
two rho t i c s of TT appears to be col lapsing , due to the infl uence of Eng l i sh
( see 2 . 3 . 8 , p . 43 ) . A similar phenomenon is found in the fal l ing toge the r of
the post- and apico-alveolar consonants ( see 2 . 3 . 1 , p . 34 ) . The se changes could
be due to lexical fading , whe re words containing the less common ( but more
marke d ) consonants , the post-alveolar one s , are gradually being l o s t f rom the
language , so that the d i s t inct ion be tween the two types is blurred and
eventually l o s t ( cf . point ( ii ) of Dre s s le r ' s conclus i ons given on p . 34 5 of3488 . 2 . 3 . 1 ) . These changes can be regarded as cases of ove rall simp l i f ication .
In TT , there are very few minimal pairs ( if any ) with post- and api co-alveolar
consonants in contrast and so there i s very l i t t le loss of seman t i c
d i s tinction .
As Dre s s s le r found in dying Bre ton , the re is much variation in the
phone t i c s and phono logy , influenced by the sound system of the dominant
language ( point ( i i i ) on p . 34 5 ) .
Although I know of no opt ional rules in TT whi ch have been lost in MT ( cf .
point ( i ) on p . 34 5 ) , a phonemic alternation , between non-nasali sed and
prenasal ised stops , in TT has been lost in MT . The prenasalisation has been
dropped comp l e t e ly by some young speake rs and is used optionally in some words
by othe r s ( see 2 . 3 . 3 , p . 37 ) .
S ince dif fe rent TT speech s tyles have not been s tudied , particularly
before extensive contact with Engl ish , i t cannot be determined whe ther the re
has been much ' s tyli s t i c shrinkage ' ( see point ( iv ) , p . 345 ) . 4 7 Even i f the re
has been some ' s t yl i s t i c shrinkage ' there has also been ' s tyl i s t i c expans i on ' ,
in which a LTT style has become a very formal style for some young people , with
a l e s s formal s tyle being MT (with inflected auxi l iarie s ) and an even l e s s
f ormal s t y l e being casual MT (with n o inf lec ted auxi liarie s ) ( see Table 8 . 1 ,
p . 330) .
In the i r more formal styles MT speake rs tend to use phonological
variat ions whi ch are closer to the TT phonology , such as the use of an ini tial
/ 8/ on p ronouns .
I t would seem then tha t the Tiwi s i tua tion does not exactly para l l e l that
o f cases o f dying languages as far as the phonologi cal changes are conce rned .
( 2 ) Lexicon
In MT , as in Tlaxclan Nahuat l and Arvani t ika , there i s considerable
relexi f i c a t ion , through the use of English loans ( see 7 . 2 . 1 , p . 3 1 7 ) . Trudg i l l
( 1 9 7 7 : 39 ) que s t ions whe ther the l o s s of Albanian words in Arvanit ika i s a case
of reduc tion s ince the Arvani tika speake rs know and use Greek loan e quivalents
in the i r Arvan i t ika . Thi s applies in the MT si tuation to a certain extent with
re spect to Eng l i sh loans . Howeve r , there i s clearly reduct i on as many of the
TT words l o s t have no equivalent in MT , such as the names of d i f f e rent species
o f bush honey ( see 3 . 2 . 3 , p . 9 1 , and Appendix 1 » . On the o ther hand , the
lexicon is expanded as word s are borrowed for new items and concepts ; such as
purrupuli ' f ootbal l ' . In TT the term i s yilogha which has been extended to
cover thi s from the trad i ti onal meaning of ' bladde r ' .
The reduc ti on and expansion in the lexicon can be seen to be due to the
need to mee t the demands of a changing cul ture and is the same type of change
which occurs in normal language change when the culture is also changing
( though pe rhaps more s lowly ) .
The vas t reduction of the class of verb s tems and the corresponding
expansion o f the class o f f ree form ve rbs could be seen as relexi f i c a t i on .
Howeve r , the process involves more than that and i s part o f the gene ral change
f rom the use of synthe t i c to analyt i c forms ( see ( 5 ) below) .","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356]"
"7.3VERBAL CONSTRUCTIONS(see Chapter 4 )I t i s in the ve rbal cons t ruct ion that the greatest changes have taken
place . The se changes seem to have inf luenced the maj or changes in the
s t ructure of the language .
The changes are :

( i i ) The complex inf lections of the TT verb have been greatly reduced
( no rma l ly with compensat ion el sewhere see Chapte r 6 and cf . Table 4 . 3 , p . 1 52 ,
and Table 4 . 4 , p . 1 5 4 ) , Thi s has involved the loss of virtually all incorporated
fo rms and the loss of mos t a f f ixes except the subj ect -tense pref ixes and s ome
aspect a f f i xes .
( i i i ) There is the generalisation of the subj ect -tense pre f ixe s from three
sets ( t rans i t ive , feminine and gene ral ) to one set ( cf . 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 , p . 1 7 2 , and
4.2.2.2, p. 176).
( iv ) The set o f free form verbs i s expanded in MT to include , as wel l as
some TT-derived forms , loan ve rbs f rom Engl ish or Pidgin Eng l i sh (most

"354Some cre o l i s t s hold this view, that a language i s created anew by each
gene r a t i on , as being par t i cularly evident in the forma ti on of creole s .
Bicker ton ( 1 9 7 5 : 6 ) says tha t 'creoles are , qui te l i terall y , invented or
re invented each t ime they appear ' . He cl aims ( 1 9 7 7 : 64 ) that a pidg i n , by i t s
very na ture , i s inadequate a s a model f o r chi ld ren t o use a s a primary language
be ing ' too impove ri shed and uns table a medium to se rve all the communicat ive
ne eds of an ind ividual . '
Chi ldren must then draw upon the i r innate knowledge to expand the language
to enable it to function adequat e l y .
S lobin ( 1 9 7 7 ) looks a t the cognit ive and communi cat ive dete rminants of the
nature of language and how the se apply in relat i on to language change ,
comparing the change apparent in language acqui s i t i on , historical change and
change in contact s i tua tions . He presents four basic 'ground rule s ' to which a
communicative system must adhere i f it is to func t ion as a 'full-f ledged human
language ' ( S lobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 8 6 ) . These f our ' charge s ' are :
( i ) Be clear ( s ta ted previously as one of Slobin's ope rating principles of
chi ld language : 'Underlying semantic relations should be marked ove r t l y and
clearly' ( Slobin 1 9 7 3 » .
( i i ) Be humanly proce s sible in ongoing time , meaning that ' language must
conform to s t rategie s of speech percept ion and production' ( Slobin 1 9 7 7 : 1 86 ) .
( ii i ) Be quick and easy , relating to the human propens i ty to ' cut corne r s
( 197 7 : 187 ) .
( iv ) Be expres s ive , in�luding two important aspect s : seman t i c and
rhe t orical . A fully expres sive language needs to be able to encode a wide
range of seman t i c no t i ons and must also be able to be used for more than j us t
conveying l ogical propo s i t i ons and referential informat ion.
It needs t o
provide speakers w i t h means of engaging a he are r ' s attention , of conveying
speci f i c a t t i tude s , of expressing social relat i onships e t c .
S lobin sees the se four principles a s i n conf l i c t , the f i r s t two tending t o
s impl i f y language and the latter two tending to e laborate and expand i t .
Pidgin languages and early chi ld languages are seen a s being inf l uenced mo s t by
the f i r s t two principles and creo l e s and adult language ( or older chi ld
language ) need to at tend more to the last two charge s .
Whi l e Slobin's the ory is not fully deve loped ( a t the time when the study
for thi s present work was done ) and there may be some problems in it ( s ee
Sankoff 1 9 7 7b and S chles inge r 1 9 7 7 ) , it does seem to go a long way in
explaining the nature of language change and the relat ionships between language
change and language acqui s i tion.
It exp lains the s imi larity in s t ructure and
func tion between the Tiwi and Eng l i s h spoken by young children and pidgin
language s ( i . e . very l i t t l e inf l e c t i on and with the inf lect i on which i s present
being regularised or generalised , s t r i c t SVO orde r , l i t t le marking of tense or

spoken by older children and young adu l t s and creole languages ( wi th more
inflec tion , marking o f tense and aspect and more use of subordinate
s t ructure s ) .
S ince Slobin ' s principles app ly to chi ld and adult language in gene ral
(not just in a contact s i t uation) in relation to pidgins and creoles , they do
not explain other simi l a r i t i e s ( such as lexical ) between MT ( and TE ) and the
northern Aus t ra lian creoles ( see note 58 ) . Nor do they explain the d i f fe rence355
between the MT spoken by adu l t s (young and old ) and the i r LTT s tyles . The re
appear to be add i t i onal reasons concerning the language acqui s i t ion his t o r i e s
of M T speake r s . The acqui s i t ion hi s t o r i e s of the Tiwi young people appear t o
b e different from those of the semi-speakers of Eas t Sutherland Gae l i c .
The semi-speake r s of E SG had various Gae l i c acqui s i t i on histori e s .
Dori an says ( 1 9 8 1 a : 1 4 8 ) :As[ Some ] were fluent child-speakers , dominant in Gae l i c , at
the time they entered schoo l .
[ Some ] also had
childhood pro f iciency great e r than the i r current
proficiency , but they we re neve r completely fluent and
neve r Gae l i c-dominant ;
others learned more active
ski l l s as they grew old e r , through having an interest in
the language .
• • •The se semi-speaker s had the i r primary socialisat i on in Eng l i sh or Engl ish
be came the i r primary language after entering school . 62
In the Tiwi s i tua t i o n , it i s my be l i e f that mos t of the young people ,
whose f i r s t language is MT , have never had the i r primary socialisat ion in TT ,
so tha t by the time they entered school they were not fluent TT speake r s .
By
the same token the primary socialisation has no t been in Eng l i s h either ( though
nowadays chi ldren are addre ssed in both Tiwi and Eng l i sh , see Table 8 . 1 ,
p . 33 6 ) .
As I have mentioned el sewhe re , the se days adults and olde r children tend
to speak to young children in a 'baby talk' ve r s i on of Tiwi ( BT ) ( as we ll as a
simple vers ion of TE ) . Thi s BT is basically a casual MT ( i . e . with no
TT-derived i nf l e c ted verbs or auxi l i a r ie s ) but with s ome phonological
d i f f e rences { su ch as /y/ for / r / and api co-alveolars for retrof lex
consonants ) . 6 3 The use of baby talk seems to be a common feature in Aus t ral ian
Abo riginal languages ( see Chapter 7 , note 1 , p . 3 2 3 ) as i t is in languages all
ove r the world ( Brown 1 9 7 7 : 20 ; Ferguson 1 9 7 7 ) . 64
It seems highly probable ( because of the complexi ty of the TT mo rphology )
that even before contact the re exi s ted a BT style .
One feature of this whi ch
seems t o have survived into the present BT , and hence into MT ( in addit ion to
the phonological d i f f e rence s ) , is the use of the singular impe rative as a free
form verb ( see 7 . 3 , p . 3 1 8 , and 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 , p . 20 5 ) . There mus t have been a point in
time when adults started us ing more Eng l i sh loans , including verbs , in the i r
BT .
It is not clear if this occur red because older children were already
speaking a ve r s i on o f Tiwi which contained a greater number of ve rbal complexes
( compared to inf lected independent ve rbs ) and using English loan ve rbs as the
f ree form verbs in these ve rbal complexe s , due to the gradual bre akdown and
re lexif i c a t i on of the language .
Thi s may have been the case . Howeve r , there is ano ther possible
explanat ion which seems to correlate with the age div i s ion be tween MT and LTT
speakers . During the t ime of Father Gse l l ( 1 9 1 1 - 1 9 3 8 ) communi cation with the
olde r people was in Pidgin English ( see 8 . 2 . 1 , p . 3 2 7 ) . Father McGrath , who
took over from Father Gse l l , apparently had a very good command of Tiwi and
the re was l i t t l e need for the older people to speak F.ngli s h , 65 though it was
s t i l l t aught to the child ren in school . When Father McGrath l e f t in 1 948 ,356the re would probably have been a break in communication with the older people .
I t is my be l i e f tha t , rathe r than reve rt ing to us ing a form of pidgin Eng l i s h 66
in which t o communicate to the older people , the remaining staff ( only a few) ,
in emulat ing Father McGrath , spoke Tiwi to them.
( Most mi ss ion staff have
a lways se emed to pick up and use s ome Tiwi , mainly common words ) . Howeve r ,
because of the lack of con t rol of the language by mos t of them this would have
been a very much reduced form , with perhaps the use of Engli sh verbs rather
than the complex Tiwi one s . I n turn , the older Tiwi may have used a ' f ore igner
talk' Tiwi to the mis si on staff , again with some Engl ish verbs . Thi s may have
come to form the basis of a BT form , which adu l t s may have begun using with
chi ldren , possibly to make the i r entry into school easier or perhaps j us t to
make i t e a s i e r to communicate with the children who had been inf luenced by
Eng l i s h . The ' f o r e i gner talk' Tiwi may have been based upon a pre-exi s t ing BT
form.
However the BT developed , i t seems to me that an angl i c i sed BT is the
'pidgin' or simplif ied hybrid upon which MT has been bui l t and expanded .
Fe rguson and de Bose ( 1 9 7 7 ) point out the simi l a r i t i e s between ' s i mpl i f ied '
regi s t e r s ( such as broken language , fo re igne r talk and baby talk) and pidgins .
MUhlhHus ler ( 1 980 : 48 ) says that simp l i f i ed registers of this type
appear to be mos t influential r ight a t the beginning of t he
pidgin-creole life-cycle
[ but ]
l i t t le is known
about the i r role s
in the form of 'mothere se ' , in the
gradual trans i ti on from a second to a f i r s t language .
• • •• • •• • •In the Tiwi s i tuation thi s BT has not developed into a s table pidgin .
However as MUhlhHusler ( 1 98D : 32 ) points out :
Creol i zat i on seems to be able to take place at any s t age o f
a developmental continuum .
Fur the r Bicke r ton ( 1 9 7 7 : 5 7 ) says :
[ The ] period at which this step takes place will be
decide d , not by any inte rnal deve lopment in the pidgin , but
by the communicational needs of chi ldren .
Although the role of baby talk in a chi l d ' s language acqui s i t ion is not
clearly unde rs t ood as yet ,
the s t ructure of the input is proving more and more to be a
crucial factor
in the sense of utte rances d i re cted at
the chi l d .
( Traugot t 1 9 7 7 : 83 ) 67
• • •Nobody deve lops a language in a vacuum, so to this
knowledge [ i . e . innate knowledge di scussed by Bicke r ton ] 68
we must add chi ldre n ' s refe rence to perceptual s t rategies
that analyze the input provided both by the pidgin , however
inadequate , and the nat ive languages heard though not
ne cessarily wel l unders tood by the chi ld .
( Traugot t
1977 : 8 7 )
I t would seem then , that the basis o f young Tiwi children ' s speech has
been an angl i c i sed BT . Trad i t iona l l y , chi ldren would probably have been
expected t o stop us ing CT by a certain age , possibly five or s i x , as is the357
present c a s e w i t h Anindi lyakwa ( Leeding 1 9 7 7 ) . Howeve r , w i t h the introduc t i on
of an ang l i c i sed BT thi s expe c t a ti on may have been waived and children were
perhaps not correc ted . Olde r children also we re possibly addressed in an
anglici sed Tiwi and they in turn add ressed younger chi ldren in angl ici sed BT .
Al though MT cannot be regarded as a creole in the s t r i c t e s t sense of the
term, it does appe ar to be a creolised form of an angli cised BT . BT is not the
f i r s t language of anyone but it i s in a sense a 'contac t ' l anguage ( cf . Giv6n
1979 : 5 ) .
In the development of MT , children ( and adult s to a ce rtain extent )
have drawn upon Tiwi , Engl i sh and Pidgin Eng l i sh to produce a hybrid or
amalgam.
An expanded form of this ang l i cised BT i s also used by older adul t s as a
se cond ' language ' 69 in speaking to olde r children and young adul t s ( see Table
8 . 1 , p . 33 6 ) . Although I have not s tudied the d i f f e rences be tween the MT spoken
as a f i r s t l anguage by young people and that spoken as a se cond ' l anguage ' by
olde r adul t s , there do appe ar to be d i f f e rence s . 70 The phono logy of the MT of
older adul t s is closer to TT phonology ( the Eng l i sh loans a re normally more
Tiwiised as wel l ) . Olde r adul t s use more TT inf lect ions in the auxil i a r y ve rb
(when they use one ) and do not normally use the aspect words tra ' t ry ' or sat
' s t a r t ' , though they do use pin 'pas t ' in the i r casual MT ( see no te 58 , p . 364 ) .
I am not sure when adu l t s started to speak to chi ldren in s imple TE in
add i t ion to BT .
I t i s pos s ibly a fairly recent step . However , even before
that , children we re coming into contact with Engl ish , at least when they
reached school and possibly even earlier .
As has been pointed out before , Chi ldren ' s Tiwi and the i r Tiwi-Engl i sh
converge ( 1 . 7 , p . l l ) . From studies done by Vol terra and Taes chner ( 1 9 7 7 : 3 1 1 ) ,
i t seems that children who grow up learning two languages go through three
stage s :
( i ) the chi ld has one lexical system which includes words f rom both
languages .
( i i ) the chi ld d i s tingui shes two dif ferent lexicons but app l i e s the same
synt a c t i c rule s .
( ii i ) the child has two l ingui s t i c codes dif f e rentiated both in lexi con
and syntax , but each language is exclusive ly associa ted with the pe rson using
that language .
With Tiwi children the second s tage seems to last conside rably longer
( un t i l about six or seven years old ) than in a s table b i l i ngual s i tuat i o n .
Thi s i s po s s i bly because the same person speaks b o t h languages to the chi ld .
However , Tiwi chi l d ren do seem to eventually develop and sort out the i r Eng l i s h
and the i r Tiwi . A s children grow o l d e r they deve lop a more formal MT s tyle
which more closely app roaches TT than the i r casual style does ( i . e . with the
use of inf lected TT-derived auxi l iaries , the use of more TT-derived words and
Tiwiised Engl ish loans , 7 1 and with a syntax more like TT ) . They also develop a
s tyle of Eng l i s h which i s closer to SAE and which they use with Europeans ,
whi l e retaining a more casual s tyle of TE which they use in code-swi t ching in
the i r speech with the i r pee r s ( see 8 . 2 . 2 . 3 , p . 344 ) .","[361, 362, 363, 364, 365]"

1.2HISTORICAL BACKGROUIID OF THE TIWIBefore the early 20th Century the re was l i t tle contact between the Tiwi
i s l ands and the ma inland , which was regarded by the Tiwi as the home of the
dead .
'They regarded the inhabited world as composed of the i r own two is land s
and on those i s lands they l ived a self-contained exclus ive exis tence' (Hart and
P i l l ing 1 9 60 : 9 ) . Thi s lack of contact can be seen in both the i r culture and
language . No other Aus tral ian language has be en demonstrated to be closely
related t o Tiwi , a l though i t shares s ome fea ture s , such as a simi l a r sound
system, with other Aus tralian language s . Tiwi is typologically more similar to
the languages of the north-we s t of Aus t r a l ia , in that i t has a simi l a r type of
p ronoun system and shows some simi l a r i t i e s in the type of ve rbal inf lect ion .
Like o the r Aus t r a li an Aborigina l g roups , the Tiwi were t r a d i ti onally
nomadi c hun t e r s and gathe rers . Howeve r , the culture of the Tiwi , though
fundamentally that of mainland Aborigines , has some features which a re
d i s tinct .
Male ini t ia t ion ce remonies on the mainland focus upon
c i r cumci s i on or subinci s ion or both; ne i ther custom was
prac t i sed by the Tiwi , who ins tead included in the i r
ini t i a t ion r i tual the forcible plucking o u t o f the pubi c
hai r of the novice .
The degree of plural mar r i ages
achieved under the i r ma r r i age rules was f a r greater than
anything reported f o r the mainland ; the absolute

I t seems tha t , in gene ra l , contact with out siders such as Malays was
hos t i l e , though Malay inf luence can be seen in the ma t e r i al culture , as in the
use o f dugout canoe s . Throughout the 1 9 th Century the Tiwi increas ingly came
into contact with other people , par t i cularly Europeans , through exped i t ions to
the i slands and through shipwrecks . The a t tempt by the mili t i a , in 1 8 2 4 , to

In order to communicate with the Tiwi to prevent them spea ring pe r s onnel and

"6. 2 . 1ARGUMKHTS OF THE CLAUSE IH TKADITIOHAL TIWIIn TT , the clause may cons i s t o f j us t a ve r b , s ince mo s t of the arguments
of the verb may be indicated in the verb in some way ( or , whe re they are no t ,
they may be clear f rom the context ) , o r there may be refe rences to t he
argument s of the verb externa l l y to the verb .
Some of these nominal a rguments are encoded in the verb by a p r e f ix
ind icat ing the pe rson and numbe r ( and in the case of third per son singul a r ,
a l s o gende r ) . The se are : subj e ct ( S ) , di rect obj e c t ( nO ) and ind i re ct obj e ct
( 10 ) .
The se argument s are re f e r red to as core argument s . Other arguments ,
r e f e r red to as non-core argument s , are e i the r :248
( i ) requi red or implied by the semantics of the verb but are not encoded
on the verb by a personal pref i x , viz secondary obj ect ( SO ) and ins t rument
( In ) ,
( i i ) signalled within the verb by the pre sence of the ' concomi tat ive
'
marke r , thus showing they are requi red by this par t i cular f o rm o f the verb ,
v i z . concomitat ive ( Con ) ( c f . 4 . 2 . 1 . 1 ( 3 ) , p . 1 6 5 ) .
Al l these nominal arguments of the verb may occur exte rna lly to the ve rb
as an unmarked noun phrase ( 5 . 1 , p . 22 1 ) , a personal o r impe rsonal pronoun
( 3 . 3 . 1 -3 , p . 1 00ff ) , a defini tive o r demonstra t ive ( 3 . 3 . 5 , p . 1 1 7 ) , a pronominal
phrase or a combinat ion of some of these as an appos i t ional NP ( 5 . 1 . 4 , p . 23 3 ) .

1 7 . The s e are d i s cussed mo re fully in Chapt e r 6 in relation to clause s , but
brie f l y , a secondary obj e c t is defined as a nominal argument required by
the seman t i c s of the verb stem, but which is not marked on the verb , except
some t ime s as an incorporated form , as in the se example s .
1 8 . Wi th some verbs the reci pient and addre ssee are marked by t he d i r e ct o bj e ct

d i f f i cu l t to dete rmine how the l a s t two meanings have been derived from the

2 1 . There are some cases in God f r e y ' s data whe re the nominal argument refe rred

verb s te m , though this does not seem usual .
2 2 . I can find no clear examples whe re Ci (ngi ) - is used meaning ' tree , log ,
canoe ' , wi thout a prece ding ma - .
2 3 . The only other example I have o f this form used in thi s way i s i n the
f rozen verbal form ampirikuluwurri which is used to mean ' ( mo t o r ) vehicle '
( see example 4-27 ( d » . Osborne gives kili - as meaning 'eye ' and this has
poss ibly been extended to mean 'car ' , or 'vehicle ' , perhaps re f e r ring to

LEXICAL AND smwrnc CHANGESThroughout the work , some lexical and semantic changes have been mentioned
whe re re levant . A brief d i s cussi on of some of the se are given he re , and also a
comparat ive word l i s t showing some of the change s . There a re three main ways
in whi ch the lexicon is changing :
( i ) Coining of words for int roduced i tems and concept s . Thi s is norma l l y done
by means of a verbal con s t ruc t i on , which may become f rozen , such as
ampiripunguluwurri 'car' ( l i t : ' s he goes fas t ( ? ) ' ) . For other examp l e s see
3 . 2 . 1 , p . 83 , and Osbo rne 1 9 7 4 : 1 1 7 .
It may be done by the add i t ion of suff ixes
to exi s t ing wo rds , such as milamporama ' t racto r ' (milampora ' f o o t ' + -(aw)ama
' intens i ty ( f ) ' ) , and milamporakimi ' shoe ' (milampora + -kimi ' f o r the purpose
of ' )
•( i i ) Extension of meaning . Meanings of words are extended to cover new i tems
and conce pts , such as , yilogha ' bladde r ' > ' footbal l ' , yimata 'inte s t i ne s ' >
' sausage s ' , yimanka 'shadow , r e f l e c t i on ' > ' f i lm , movi e ' .
( i i i ) Borrowing of loan word s . Thi s is by far the mos t common means in MT ,
be ing extended to cover i tems which are not bor rowed ( see 3 . 2 . 2 , p . 84 ) and to
verbs ( see 4 . 3 . 1 . 2 , p . 20S ) . The phonology of the loans vari e s f rom close to TT
to close to Eng l i s h ( see 2 . 4 , p . 49 ) .
The word l i s t given he re is not exhau s t i ve and TT words for whi ch I have
no MT equivalent are not l i sted ( see a l s o Osborne 1 9 7 4 : 1 1 7 ff and Ng Ng ) .
Similarly , a numbe r o f MT words are not l i s ted . Where there are corre sponding
mas culine , feminine and /or plural forms , the stem is given with the suff i xe s in
that o rde r . The classes of the verb stems are not given , but this can be
de termined by the form given : class 1 s tems having an ini tial consonant , class
2 s tems having an ini t ial C ( variable consonant ) , and class 3 s t ems having an
ini t ial vowel , some t imes with an opt ional /w/ .
The subj ect -tense pref ixes
taken by each stem are indicate d , v i z . gene ral ( gen ) , t rans i t ive ( t r ) , or
feminine ( fem) ( see Table 4 . S , p . 1 7 3 ) . The aux i l i ary s tem i s given with f ree
form verbs .
In the MT column the dichotomy is no t s t rict ly between f ormal
versus casual or f o rmal versus chi ldre n ' s Tiwi but ra ther showing the forms
closest to the TT form on the left and the form furthe s t from the TT form on
the right . The f orms which cont ain an alternation be tween j and th are not
pronounced d i f f e rently but rathe r show a d i f f e rence in the phonemic analys i s
( see 2 . 3 . 7 , p . 4 1 . The verbal complexes are shown centred and wri t ten in the
following way . V . C (+-mi ) In a more formal style of MT an auxiliary with verb
stem -mi is normally used but in more casual MT ( and CT ) there is no rma lly no
auxi liary.","[374, 375]"
