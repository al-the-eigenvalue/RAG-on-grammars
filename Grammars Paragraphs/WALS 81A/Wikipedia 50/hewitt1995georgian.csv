iiiVersion Vowels serve to indicate certain kinds of relationship between
subject and object, or between the direct and indirect objects. We have,
according to the standard view: Neutral Version (in Ø-/a-); Subjective
Version (in i-); Objective Version (in i-/u-); locative Version (in a-); plus
what we have styled the Indirect Object Version (in e-). Where the
Objective Version is an obligatory part of the marking of the verb's subject
in the Perfect of Transitive and Medial verbs, or where the Indirect Object
Version is obligatory for the marking of the subject in the Pluperfect and
III rd Subjunctive of Transitives and Medials, they are devoid of any true
versional šense.
Roots sometimes change shape to a certain extent in (part of) Series II
and in the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive. The relevant pattern of
change may be determined by such features as: (a) whether or not the root528GEORGIANGRAMMARcontains a vowel, and (b) the nature of the root-final consonant. Total
change of the root (suppletion) is also found, determined by such features
as: (a) tense, (b) plurality of direct object (or intransitive subject), (c)
animacy of direct object (or intransitive subject).
The various patterns of verbal morphology are most conveniently
explained under the heading of which Thematic Suffix is taken by a given
root. Where no such suffix is found, we call the verb a Root (or Athematic)
Verb.
These Thematic Suffixes for Transitive verbs are prešent
throughout Series I and, apart from -i, tend to occur in the Perfect too.
The Causative marker is usually the simple -in-, sometimes the complex
-ev-in-. Causatives then belong to the class of verbs with Thematic
Suffix -eb, though most causatives will also have the verb's usual Thematic
Suffix standing BEFORE the causative-marker as well.
The subjunctive vowels are: -e, and, depending on the variety of
Aorist, -o/-a.
Depending on the tense, the indicative vowels are: -i/-e
and, for 3rd person singular, -o/-a.
Verbs (usually!) produce a verbal noun (called the 'Masdar') plus four
verbal adjectives (participles): Active, Future, Privative and Past. The
IIIrd Series of monopersonal Intransitives and Statives is built around the
Past Participle, whilst the Masdar is the base for the formation of bivalent
Intransitives (including Indirect Verbs) in Series III.
5.1 The Simple Clause (mart'iv-i c'ina+da+d+eb+a)
šentential word-order, as is to be expected for a language where nounfunctions are indicated by c a š m a r k i n g and, in part, by verb-agreement
also, is fairly free, the neutral orderings being SOV and SVO. Arguments
can be put in focus by being placed first or last in the clause. For a
detailed discussion of word-order see Apridonidze (1986).
5.1.1CašfunctionsN.B. detailed exemplification for the c a š m a r k i n g (and verbal crossreferencing) patterns for the main arguments of the different classes of
verb in the different screeve-Series will be prešented below under 5.1.7.
5.1.1.1 Nominative (saxel+ob+it-i)
The Nominative is (a) the citation-form; it also serves under appropriate
circumstances as both
(b) subject-marker and
(c) direct object-marker;SYNTAX529(d) the Nominative of nouns with consonant-final stems can be governed by
the postposition -vit 'like' (e.g. kal-i-vit 'like a woman');
(e) alternating with the Dative, the Nominative can convey temporal
duration as well as locate an event as regularly occurring in expressions of
the form 'every X', of which some have been lexicalised so as to form a
compound adverb with the underlying adjective minus its ending -i and
written with a hyphen between adjective and noun, e.g.
a+k
did-i
xan-i
ar
da-(Ø-)rč-e
here
great-AGR time-NOM not PREV-(you-)stay-AOR.SuBJ
'Don't stay here a long time'
mtel-i
game
t'k'bil-ad
m-e-)in-a
whole-AGR night(NOM) sweet-ADV I -IOV-sleep-3rd.PER(AOR)
'I slept sweetly the whole night'
q'ovel=dge 'every day', q'ovel=tve 'every month', q'ovel=k f vira 'every
week', q ' o v e l = g a m ( e ) 'every night'.
Parallel expressions, not so
lexicalised, have the adjective functioning normally and are written as
separate words (e.g. q'ovel-i saat-i 'every/each hour').
5.1.1.2 Vocative (c'od+eb+it-i)
This marginal case is used for addressing the interlocutor. However, for
personal names it is already obsolete—where the final -i of a name is part
of the root, the Vocative does not exist or, alternatively, is identical to the
Nominative (e.g. (bat'on-o) ak'ak'i (Mr-VOC) Ak'ak'i = 'Ak'ak'i');
consonant-final names use just the bare stem (e.g. (bat'on-o) zurab
'Zurab'); vowel-final names again ignore the old ending -v (e.g.
(kal+bat'on-o) k'lara (Madam-VOC) Klara = 'K'lara'). Note how the 2nd
person pronouns lose their final -n in Vocative sequences like: še k'arg-o
k'ac-o, šena 'you good man, you', which in the plural/polite form would
be: tkve k'arg-o k'ac-o, tkvena.
5.1.1.3 Genitive (na+tes+a+ob+it-i)
The Genitive (a) manifests the same range of adnominal functions that are
typically associated with this case in languages where it exists, chiefly the
function of possession;
(b) it is used to shew age (e.g. samri c'l-is xe 3-AGR year-GEN tree = 'a
3-year-old tree'; rva c'1-isa-a 8 year-GEN-is = 'X is 8 years old'), and
similarly in such expressions as:53ØGEORGIANGRAMMARert-i
k'vir-is
jvar+da+c'er+il-n-i
one-AGR week-GEN married-Pl-NOM
'they have been married one week'a+r-i-an
be-PRES-they(c) it is governed by those postpositions that require the Genitive;
(d) a few verbs take what appears to be a direct object in the Genitive,
which is often in its long form, e.g.
i+k
mo-cd-is
m-rcxven-od-a

40GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
The natural order in English is of course here to have hither- followed by thitherorientation.
For the Dative in this quote from Vazha Pshavela cf. 5.1.1.5 (g).
The 3rd person subject-affix for this verb-form (sc. with any preverb) is actually zero
as a result of the historical accident which saw the disappearance of material from
the original end of the word, which was in Old Georgian da-val-s , where -s was the
subject-suffix.
Note the plural verb-form though the subject is inanimate in this example from KEGL
Quoted by the Dictionary of Morphemes as da-h-mger-i-s .
The 1953 edition is not accessible to me.
Forms such as (a-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (gada-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (ga-)(0-0-0-)at'an, (mo-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an (for which see the final paragraph of 4.4.4) are basically
Locative Versional forms, for which see also 4.4.4. Note also the difference in the
formation of the Perfect for the Subjective vs Locative Versional forms of this root
(e.g. a-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you (have) apparently endured X/them' vs a-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a
'you (have) apparently gone up and reached').
Cf. the Indo-European so-called Dative of Interest seen in this Latin example from
Livy: militanti in Hispania pater eimoritur 'while he was serving [sc. Historic Present]
in Spain, his father died', though, unlike Georgian, Latin verbs agree only with the
subject argument.
This is the Georgian translation (Danelia and Tsanava, 1991.47) of the Mingrelian
osur-i giti-o-bs-әn-d- ә il ndem-c from one of the texts originally published by
Q'ipshidze (1914).
KEGL does not quote the Subjective Versional form of this verb for the allomorph
with an r root-finally.
N.B. (Ø-)g-i-sm-en-t 'I am listening to you (sc. to what you have to say)' with
Objective Version, which is the standard opening gambit (a) when answering the
phone or (b) for a waiter coming to take a customer's order.
The use of this verb with 'head' as direct object in the colloquial sense of 'cause
shame to' necessitates the absence of versioniser (e.g. b i č - m a ojax-sa-c tav-i
mo-(0-)s-č'r-a da čven-s sopel-sa-c
'the lad brought shame both to the family
and to our village').
Note how this passive idea is conveyed by an active verb with non-referential 3rd
person plural subject.
In verbs of this type the 'prescriptive' periphrasis that would change a 1st or 2nd
person direct object into the 3rd person phrase 'my/our/your head' in the presence
of a 3rd person indirect object tends to be ignored.
There is also (mi-)(0-0-)i-p , at , iz'-eb .
Two Modern Georgian versions shew here the root - p ' q ' r - 'turn, direct' with
Locative Version outranking the Subjective because of the (actual or implied)
presence of an appropriate indirect object (viz. zeca-d ag-(0-?0-)a-p'q'r-o tvaln-i vs ca-s rni-(0-0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-eb-i).
Seen also in an ancient participle a+dg+il-i, now nominalised as 'place'.
Prescriptive grammar suggests that when the direct object is plural the root becomes
-xoc-, as in (Ø-Ø-)xoc-av 'you kill them'.
In a number of compounds such as this the noun jvar-i does not syncopate (cf.
me+jvar+e 'wedding-witness'), but when used in isolation it does syncopate (cf. the
Genitive jvr-is ).
The element -n(i) here is the Mingrelian equivalent of the Georgian subordinator
rom. If we transpose the Mingrelian system completely here into Georgian, an
imperfective Conditional will be achieved simply by putting the auxiliary into its
Conditional form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-a), whilst an imperfective Future Subjunctive will
result if the auxiliary is placed in its Future Subjunctive form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-e-s).","[526, 527]"

The Aorist SUBJunctive is not, however, unusual after a past-tense
introductory verb, as in this 18th century example from David the Rector's

The non-finite strategy can be used regardless of the tense of the
introductory verb, as long as the purpose is positive (i.e. non-negative) andSYNTAX577most naturally if the SUBJect of the subordinate verb is co-referential with
either the SUBJect or object of the main verb. The subordinate verb stands
in the Adverbial case of the Future Participle. If the verb is Transitive, its
direct object will surface as an objective Genitive, e.g.
ga-mo-(Ø-)i-q'(+)en-a
lenin-ma e + s k'alam-i
lenin-ERG this
pen-NOM

mag
c'er+il-is
da-sa-c'er-ad
that(by.you) letter-GEN
PREV-FuT.PTC-write-ADV
'lenin used this pen to write that letter'
In the following example it is the indirect object of the main verb who
will perform the action of the Future Participle:
maj-eb-i
ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-švir-e
bork'il-eb-is
wrist-Pl-NOM PREV-I -(3rd.PER-X-)OV-extend-AOR
cuff-Pl-GEN
da-sa-d-eb-ad
PREV-FuT.PTC-put-TS-ADV
'I held my wrists to X (sc. for X) to put on the handcuffs'
On page 123 of the 1981 second edition of the complete works of D.
K'ldiashvili there is an example where both the notional direct and indirect
objects end up side by side in the Genitive with such a Future Participle
(viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-is tav-is da-sa-g+c'-ev-ad deaf-ADV beingGEN head-GEN PREV-FuT.PTC-avoid-TS-ADV
'to avoid being deaf).
However, quoting this very example KEGl put the indirect object into a
postpositional phrase (viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-isa-gan tav-is da-sa-g+c'e v a d ) — i s the 1981 edition defective, or is the double Genitive a
legitimate treatment paralleling the example quoted in 5.1.5 (namely:
p'at'ar+jal-s sam cT-a-mde ojax-is u+pr+o+s-eb-is xm-is ga-cem-a (Ø-)e-k'rjal-eb-a 'the bride is forbidden to give voice to the
elders of the family for upto three years')? The postpositional treatment of
the indirect object is seen in: k'oncert'-ze da-sa-sc'r-eb-ad č a - m o vid-a 'X came to attend the concert' (cf. k'oncert'-s da-(Ø-)e-sc'r-o 'X
attended the concert'). On the other hand, the Genitive is used in:
vepx+is+t'q'a+osn-is k'val-is mi-sa-gn-eb-ad 'in order to locate the
track of The Man in the Panther's Skin' (cf. k'val-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-o 'X
located the track', which is one of the anomalous Transitive verbs with
indirect object but no obvious direct object) and in:578GEORGIANGRAMMARbrošs

postpositional phrase, viz. sa-k-eb-i brjen-ta mier, from which the word

An alternative non-finite strategy that makes the Genitive of the
Masdar dependent on m i z n - i t , the Instrumental of m i z a n - i 'aim', is
condemned by purists as a calque on the Russian construction s cel'ju (+
Gen) 'with the aim of...'. However, if one allows it, the relevant section of
the example 'lenin used this pen to write that letter' would be m a g
c'er+l-is da-c'er-is mizn-it.
5.2.2.1.2 Result
The main clause contains an appropriate correlative (e.g. the equivalent of
'so', 'such a', 'to such an extent', 'so many', etc.), and the following
subordinate clause will begin with the conjunction rom 'that' in combination
with a verb in the indicative mood, e.g.
i+k
i+s+e+t-i
mgl-eb-i
da
t'ur-eb-i

še-g-č'am-en
be-PRES-they
that
PREV-you-devour-they(FuT)SYNTAX579There are such wolves and jackals there that they will devour you'
By changing from 3rd to 1st person deictic marking on the correlative
adverb and by placing it immediately before the rom, we can start a
šentence which, though no longer subordinate, is stIII resultative, e.g.
axal+ga+zrč+oba-ši garda-i-cval-a.
a+s + e

hope-NOM

PREV-(it-)us-OV-reališhe(AOR)
'He died in youth. And so (The result was that) he could not realise our
hopes'
Esšentially the same construction as IIIustrated above for the basic
clause of result is employed as equivalent for English structures of the
form 'without V-ing', wherein the subordinate clause will of course contain
a negative, e.g.
i+s
mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme i+s + e, rom
that parasite(NOM) travel-TS-he
usually so
that
bilet-s
ar
(Ø-)q'id+ul-ob-s
ticket-DAT not
(it-)buy-TS-he
That parasite usually travels without buying a ticket'
Note how the ordering of correlative and subordinate clause can invert,
and how then the clitic r o m avoids c l a u š i n i t i a l position: i + s
mukta+xora m+gza+vr-ob-s xolme, bilet-s rom ar (Ø-)q'id(+)ulob-s, i+s+e.
Where the verb has a Privative Participle, it is often possible to
produce an alternative non-finite expression for the meaning 'without
VERBing' by placing the Privative Participle in the Adverbial case, any
direct object of a transitive participle going into the Genitive, e.g.

It is sometimes difficult to draw a clear dividing line between purpose and
result. Such cases have a typical resultative correlative in the main
clause, and yet the subordinate verb is SUBJunctive rather than indicative
in mood, e.g.

5.2.2.1.3 Cause
A range of conjunctions exists to mark causal clauses. Of those that
specifically indicate a reason the most colloquial is ra(+)k'i, the least
colloquial is vina+i+dan, whilst ra+d+gan(a+c) holds a middle position.
The mood of the verb will be indicative, and the ordering of main vs
subordinate clause is irrelevant, e.g.

it is likely that such expressions can be traced back to full phrases where
the Ergative will be seen to be performing its basic role; the former
example, for instance, comes from gmert-man (Ø-)i-c-i-s God-ERG
(3rd.PER-)SV-know-PRES.INDIC-he 'God knows'.
5.1.1.5 Dative (mi+c+em+it-i)
This case proto-typically marks (a) indirect objects but can also mark
(b) some direct objects as well as
(c) some logical subjects;
(d) a number of postpositions govern the Dative; (e) it parallels the
Nominative in temporal expressions of duration and regularity (e.g. q'ovel
dge-s/tve-s/k'vira-s/game-s/c'el-s 'every day/month/week/night/
year');
(f) stating the day and, if the month is mentioned, dates requires the Dative
(e.g. šabat-s 'on Saturday', p'irvel mais-s first May-DAT = 'on 1st May',
or noember-s 2 November-DAT = 'on 2nd November—N.B. the cardinal
is used for numbers not involving the element 'first'), whereas the
postposition -Si is used if only the number is given (e.g. p'irvel-ši 'on the
1st', or-ši 'on the 2nd')—other specific time-points include: dila-s 'in the
morning', sa(+)gam(+)o-s 'in the evening', na + sadil + e v - s 'in the
afternoon', dge-s 'today', šua-dge-s 'at mid-day' (cf. the GEN-DAT ending
in the synonymous šua-dg-isa-s, and note that for 'at mid-night' only this
complex ending šua-gam-isa-s is offered in the dictionaries),
na+šua+gam+ev-s 'in the early hours';
(g) today the postpositions -šl 'in, at' and -ze 'on, at' are usually employed
where OldGEORGIANcould happily have used just the Dative, and there are
at least three nouns where the simple Dative (albeit with an unusual avowel before the Dative-suffix -s) are stIII as common as the postpositional
equivalents (viz. a+m a+dg+il-as/a+dg+il-ze 'at this place', a+m c'ut-532GEORGIANGRAMMARa s / c ' u t - š i '(at) this minute', (na+)p'ir-as 'on the edge' = ( n a + ) p ' i r z e / k ' i d e - z e as in č'-is p'ir-as 'on the edge of the well', m i n d v r - i s
na+p'ir-as 'on the edge of the meadow');
(h) The verb 'to prefer' is an Indirect Verb with logical subject in the
Dative and logical object in the Nominative. Nevertheless, the entity to
which the logical object is preferred, when expressed, also stands in the
Dative, e.g.
m-i-rč(+)ev(+)n-i-a
p'ur-i
gorn-s
I -OV-prefer-PRES-it
bread-NOM grits-DAT
'I prefer bread to grits'
kal-s
v-(Ø-)u-rč(+)ev(+)n-i-v-a+r
šen-s
woman-DAT I-(she-)OV-prefer-PRES-I-COP
your-AGR
'the woman prefers me to you'tav-s
head-DATIn the related Mingrelian language the postposition -s'a must attach to
the entity preferred (e.g. respectively for these same meanings m-i-sxunu kobal-i gum-ša and osur-s v-(Ø-)u-sxun-u-k skan+i dud+i-ša);
(i) See 5.1.3 and 5.2.2.2.3 for the Dative with participles, and 5.1.5 for the
Dative accompanying the Masdar.
5.1.1.6 Instrumental (mo+km+ed+eb+it-i)
This basically signifies (a) the instrument or means by which an action is
accomplished (e.g. sxv-is-i xel-it ga-k'et-eb-ul-i sa(+)km(+)e otherGEN-AGR hand-INST PREV-make-TS-RPTC-AGR
deed(NOM) = 'a deed
done at another's hand');
(b) the postposition -urt (from cardinal ert-i '1') governs the Instrumental
and shews accompaniment (e.g. col=šv(+)il-it-urt 'with wife and child',
with which is synonymous the Adverbial of an adjective in -Ian-:
c o l = š v ( + ) i l - i a n - a d , which in turn is paralleled by the comitative
postposition - t a n followed by the Adverbial of the cardinal T :
col=šv(+)il-tan ert-ad);
(c) the Instrumental has certain temporal functions: when a non-continuous
activity has an effect that lasts for some time, that period is marked by the
Instrumental, e.g.
a+k
hereča-mo-[v-jved-i
PREV-PREV-[I-jcome-AOR.INDIC(//čem-i

ekvs-i tv-it
PREV-PREY-I-(him-)NV-šend-AOR.INDIC
6-AGR month-INST
'I have come here (//šent my student here) for 6 months'If the Dative alone can refer to a specific point in time, one can take
season- and week-names (plus a few others) and add to them the abstractnoun formant -oba in the Instrumental to indicate, in most cases,
habituality, expressions which are synonymous with combinations of the
type 'q'ovel + DAT' (e.g. o r + š a b a t - o b - i t 'on Mondays', z a m t r - o b - i t
'(regularly) in the winter', sa(+)gam(+)o-ob-it 'of an evening', though here
the plain Instrumental sa(+)gam(+)o-ti (= q'ovel sa(+)gam(+)o-s)
suffices; cT-ob-it, however, means rather 'over a period of years', as seen
in:
cT-ob-it
šjen-il-s
(Ø-)k'arg-av-s
year-ABST-INST PREV-acquire-P.PTC-DAT
(it-)lošTS-X
c'am-ita
second-INST
'What X has acquired over a period of years X loses in a second'
The expression 'in a second', however, is usually Dative c ' a m - s or
postpositional c'am-ši, but dil-it 'in the morning' is used like the Dative
dila-s especially in such phrases as dil-it adre//adr+ian(+ad) 'early in
the morning');
(d) the verb 'take advantage of' governs an object in the Instrumental, e.g.
v-(?Ø-)i-sa+rg+eb+l-eb
I -(?3rd.PER-)SV-take.advantage.of-TS(FuT)
'I shall take advantage of this occasion'a+m še+mtxv+ev-it

Instrumental, the second in the Nominative, e.g.score stands in themo-(Ø-)i-g-es

meeting(NOM) draw-ADV PREV-end-PASS-it(AOR)
The meeting ended in a draw'
(f) compass-points in expressions such as 'to the north (of X)' utilise the
Instrumental (e.g. (zugdid-is)
(5rdilo+et-it/sa+mxr+et-it/da+sa+
vl+et-it/ag+mo+sa+vl+et-it Zugdidi-GEN
north-INST/south-INST/
west-INST/east/-INST
'to the north/south/west/east (of Zugdidi)');
(g) some expressions stand in the Instrumental (e.g. čem-i(s) azr-it 'in my
opinion', i+m mi+mart+ul+eb-it 'in that direction', ded-it svan-i-a
mother-INST Svan-NOM-is 'X's a Svan on his/her mother's side', londonis dro-it 'by london-time');
(h) by adding the abstract-noun formant -oba in the Instrumental case to a
cardinal root one produces the expression for 'in NuMBERs', e.g.
jar+is+k'ac-eb-i
as-ob-it
soldier-Pl-NOM
100-ABST-INST
'the soldiers are standing in hundreds'dg-a-n-an
stand-PRES-3rd.PER.Pl-theyThis form, always invariant, can act as a sort of adjective in expressions of
the type 'NuMBERs of NOuNs', e.g.

self-DAT
'hundreds and thousands of workers are congregating under one roof'
5.1.1.7 Adverbial (vitar+eb+it-i)
Basically the case serves (a) to make a predication, e.g.
k'ac-is k'vl-a
cod+v+a-d
i-tvl-eb-a
man-GEN kIII-MASD(NOM) sin-ADV
PASS-count-TS-it

gvel-i
kva-d

snake-NOM stone-ADV
(PREV-)PASS-turn.into-it(AOR)
'the snake turned into stone'
(b) adding the Adverbial ending to adjectives produces the equivalent535SYNTAXadverb, though some adverbs lack the final -d (e.g. lamaz-ad 'beautifully',
k'arg-ad 'well', čkar-a 'quickly', nel-a 'slowly');
(c) the Future Participle in the Adverbial is a non-finite way of expressing
a purpošclause and will be exemplified below (5.2.2.1.1);
(d) governed by the postposition -mde (older form -mdis) 'upto' the case's
final -d is dropped in ModernGEORGIAN(e.g. kalak-a-mde 'as far as the
town'). The postposition may be reinforced by vi+d+re, especially, it
seems, when dates are given (e.g. vi+d+re 1917 cT-a-mde upto 1917
year-ADV-upto 'upto the year 1917'1);
(e) prices are expressed by the Adverbial, e.g.
e + s beč'ed-i
v-(Ø-)i-q'id-e
this ring-NOM
I-(it-)SV-buy-AOR.INDIC
'I bought this ring for 1,ØØØ pounds'at-as
1Ø-1ØØgirvank-ad
pound-ADV(f) the Adverbial (or the postposition -ze) renders the phrase 'in language
X', e.g.
kart+ul-ad / / kart+ul( ena)-ze
gada+targmn+il-i-a
GEORGIAN-ADVGEORGIAN(language)-on translated-NOM-is
'It is translated intoGEORGIAN'
5.1.1.8 Ablative (da+čor+eb+it-i) = Instrumental+-gan (see 3.4.3)
This simply indicates spatial or temporal source (e.g. mindvr-i(+)dan 'from
the meadow', dge-i(+)dan 'from today', i+m dg-i(+)dan 'from that day').
N.B. the middle vowel in a+k-e+dan 'from here'.
5.1.2 The Adnominal Genitive (cf. 3.1.1)
In ModernGEORGIANadnominal Genitives usually precede their head-nouns
(e.g. saxl-is k'edel-i houšGEN
wall-NOM 'the wall of the house', rtul-i
st'rukt'ur-is zmna complex-AGR structure-GEN verb(NOM) 'a verb of
complex structure'). In OldGEORGIANthis order was reversed, and the
older sequence is not unknown even today, most naturally when the headnoun stands in the Nominative or Dative. In such cases the Genitive takes
its long form (e.g. k'edel-i saxl-isa). The reason for this is that in the
ancient language the c a š e n d i n g of the head was repeated at the end of
the NP (giving in this particular example k'edel-i saxl-isa-y). Because
the palatal semi-vowel has disappeared, the nature of this structure is536GEORGIANGRAMMARobscured, but when the head-noun is Dative, the Dative ending can stIII be
repeated on the following Genitive (e.g. k'edel-s saxl-isa(-s)). Though
the modern examples of such reduplication are not unknown when the
head-noun is Vocative, Ergative and Adverbial, they have a distinctly
archaic flavour. However, there is one circumstance where this possibility
of double c a š m a r k i n g is fully utilised today, regardless of which c a š
marker follows the Genitive, and this is where the head-noun is gapped, e.g.
čem-i
my-AGRvaž+i+šv(+)il-is
son-GENkc+ev+a-m
behaviour-ERGga-m-a-oc-a,
PREV-me-NV-amazeit(AOR)kal+i+šv(+)il-isa-m
k'i
ara
daughter-GEN-ERG
however not
'My son's behaviour amazed me, but not that of my daughter'
The end-sequence -GEN-DAT (-isa-s) when associated with a verbal
noun (theGEORGIANMasdar—cf. 5.1.5) functions as a reduced temporal
clause 'at the time of VERBing', being a short-hand version of the Masdar
in the Genitive dependent upon dro-s time-DAT 'at the time (sc. of
VERBing)' (e.g. ezo-ši š e - s v l - i s a - s / / š s v l - i s dro-s yard-into PREVenter(MASD)-GEN-DAT//PREV-enter(MASD)-GEN
time-DAT 'at the
moment of entering the yard'). This same construction is found with
ordinary nouns which, while not formally masdars, have a sort of verbal
force (e.g. masal-is analiz-isa-s material-GEN analysis-GEN-DAT 'while
analysing the material').
5.1.3 The Attributive Adjective (cf. 3.2.1)
ModernGEORGIAN,unlike its older variant, places adjectives in front of
their heads. Vowel-final adjectives shew no agreement at all with their
heads, whilst the literary language has settled on the following pattern of
agreement (cf. 3.2.1 and 5.Ø.1) for consonant-finals, where mc'vane =
'green', lamaz-i = 'beautiful', and čit'-i = 'bird':NOMINATIVE

noun in the relevant c a š f o r m stands before the conjunction da 'and'. If
adjectives are conjoined with an NP, the adjective preceding da can be
treated as if it were a noun and given the long desinence appropriate to
the noun it qualifies; this phenomenon is most often seen for Genitive and
Dative NPs, e.g.

An oddity was noted in literary Georgia (ll-XI-88, p. 13): as we have
seen, adjectives meaning 'possessed of N' may be freely formed by using
the derivational suffix -ian-i, so that 'a mother with a child' will be
bavšv-ian-i deda. The noun-base of such adjectives is itself qualifiable
by an adjective, and the example in question reads: ak'van-ši m+q'+op-i
bavšv-ian-i deda-c 'and a mother with a child (being) in a cradle'. A
native speaker, when prešented with this example for comment, reacted
somewhat negatively to the prešence on the epithet of the final vocalic
agreement-affix. If such compounds as m+k'vet+r+na+k'vt+eb-ian-i
'sharp-featured' (<= m+k'vet+r-i plus na+k'vt-eb-i), naz+bumbul-ian-i
'soft-downed' and lamaz+q'd-ian-i 'with beautiful covers (of books)'
reprešent the norm, then the bare stem for the adjective (namely m+q'+op)
would indeed be anticipated here. Note also the almost exact parallel to
the oddity above in Vazha Pshavela's ga+šav+eb+ul sa+rkv+el-ian-ad
'blackened cover and all', where the qualifying participle is without any
ending.
When the kinship-terms m a m a 'father', deda 'mother', bija 'uncle',
p'ap'a/babua 'grandfather', di+deda/bebia 'grandmother', m a m + i + d a
'father's sister', and de+i+da 'mother's sister' are coupled with a possessive
adjective, the possessive is placed after the noun and written with a
hyphen to indicate that the sequence is viewed as a single word, such that
only the possessive changes for case.
Quantifiers prescriptively require the singular form of the noun, though538GEORGIANGRAMMARcolloquially the plural is also heard (e.g. or-i, ra+m(o+)den+i+me,
mraval-i cxvar-i '2/some/several sheep').
In an example like '3 Xs of Y(s)'GEORGIANtreats 'Y' as the head of the
expression, whilst the rest functions as a complex quantifier, as exemplified
by three c a š f o r m s for the expression '3 baskets of apples', where sam-i
= '3', godor-i = 'basket', and vašl-i = 'apple':

jointly can then similarly function as a complex quantifier (e.g.

Quantifiers of the form 'cardinal and a half Xs' place na+x+ev+ar-i
after the noun in conjunction with which it functions as a single complex
unit (noun or adjective, as the case may be), e.g.

'I am giving you 5 and a half kilos of carrots'Participles behave just like simple adjectives. Those that reprešent
reduced relative clauses may be accompanied by arguments from that
clause. If the head-noun has attributes of its own, in order not to overload
the pre-nominal slot, the adjective phrase can follow the head. With active
participles of transitive verbs the underlying direct object becomes an
objective Genitive, e.g.","[549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557]"
"2GEORGI AN GRAMMARTable 1: Family-tree of the Kartvelian LanguagesWithin Georgia itself, as indicated on the accompanying map, Svan is
spoken in the high mountain-valleys of the rivers Enguri and Cxenis-c'q'ali
in the north-western region of Svaneti(a), east of Abxazia. Mingrelian is
located in Mingrelia, the lowland area of West Georgia that is bounded by
Abxazia, Svaneti(a), Imereti and Guria. As for Georgian, its many and
diverse dialects are: Ač'aran, Gurian, Imeretian in the west, Lečxumian,
Rač'an in the north-west, Mtiulur-Gudamaq'rulian, Moxevian in the north,
Xevsurian, Pshavian and Tush in the north-east, K'ax(et)ian in the east,
Mesxian, Dzhavaxian in the south(-west), and Kartlian in the centre. The
literary dialect, which is described below, is based on the speech of the
province of Kartli, in which the capital Tbilisi is situated.
It might be appropriate to observe at this point that, although the
Georgians on the whole profess (Orthodox) Christianity, as a result of
Turkish influence the natives of Ač'ara adopted Islam. The interplay of
religion and ethnicity is also relevant with regard to the S.W. province of
Mesxeti. On 15th November 1944 144,000 (according to the figure most
regularly quoted) residents of the area and adherents of Islam were exiled
to Soviet Central Asia, a fate that was suffered by a number of Soviet
peoples around the time of World War 11 (Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans,
and from the N. Caucasus Balkars, Karachays, Chechens and Ingush).
Though acknowledged under Khrushchëv to have been guilty of no crimes
(such as treason), these Mesx(et)ians have not yet secured permission to
return to their homeland, principally because of opposition from the
government of Georgia, and many had to be hurriedly evacuated from
Uzbekistan following the inter-ethnic conflict that flared up in the
Ferghana Valley in 1989. These people are usually referred to as
«Mesx(et)ian Turks», and it has been suggested that they were removed
from the border-area because of their pro-Turkish sympathies in advanceINTRODUCTION3of a possible Soviet incursion into Turkey. The precise ethnic allegiance
of the possibly 300,000 who wish to return to Georgia is a matter of
dispute: are they turkified Georgians or ethnic Turks, descended from
those who settled in an area regarded by Georgians as primaeval Georgian
land when it became the border between Georgia and Ottoman Turkey?
The arguments put forward in support of Georgia's refusal to allow their
resettlement are that: (a) the region has been repopulated, (b) there is no
room elsewhere in Georgia either, (c) Christian Georgians have always
been, and still are being, threatened by adherents of Islam*, so that to
accept the influx of so many muslims, especially along their border with
Turkey, would be to invite trouble. The most that has been offered is
resettlement somewhere within Georgia of those who (a) vow allegiance to
Georgia, (b) know, or will learn, Georgian, (c) have, or will adopt, Georgian
surnames, and (d) convert to Christianity.
1.1 The Languages of the Caucasus
The Caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the multiplicity of
languages spoken there. In the 10th century the Arab al-Mas'udi named it
«the mountain of tongues» (Catford 1977). A variety of language-families
are represented there, such as Indo-European (Ossetic, Armenian, Russian)
and Turkic (Azeri, Kumyx), but apart from these there are at least three,
possibly four, autochthonous families. In addition to Kartvelian the others
are: North West Caucasian (Abxaz-Abaza, Circassian, Ubyx), North Central
Caucasian (Chechen, Ingush, Bats), North East Caucasian (Avar, Andi,
Botlix, Ghodoberi, K'arat'a, Axvax, Bagval, T'indi, C'amalal, Dido, Xvarsh,
Hinux, Bezhti, Hunzib, Lak', Dargwa, Lezgi(an), Tabassaran, Arči, Aghul,
Rutul, Ts'axur, Budux, Xinalugh, Udi, K'ryts'. North Central and North East
Caucasian are treated by most as a single family. In fact, all the northern
families may be genetically related. From the above-list Abxaz and Bats
are spoken not in the geographical north Caucasus but within the republic
of Georgia (cf. §1.6 below).
All these indigenous languages are characterised by the presence of an
ejective series of consonants, and all apart from modern Mingrelian have
normally been accepted as manifesting to a greater or lesser degree the
phenomenon of ergativity, though this issue with respect to Georgian
continues to foster much lively debate (see Hewitt 1983, 1987a, 1989 and
1995 for the details). If North West Caucasian as a family can be thought
of as being marked by large consonantal inventories with correspondingly
minimal vowel-systems and also by polysynthetic verb-forms with
correspondingly simple morphology within the nominal system, elsewhere in4GEORGIAN GRAMMARthe north Caucasus one tends to find complex vowel-systems and rich
morphology for the noun, balanced by relatively straightforward verbs.
Kartvelian occupies a middle position by virtue of having (a) a reasonable
proportion of consonants to vowels (even if, as shewn later, there is a
surprising tolerance of consonant-complexes), and (b) a comparative
complexity within both nominal and verbal morphology.
1.2 The Georgian Scripts
Georgian is unique amongst not only the Kartvelian languages but also the
38 or so autochthonous languages of the Caucasus as a whole in possessing
an unbroken literary tradition of some 15 centuries; though some attempts
were made in the 19th century to establish scripts for other indigenous
languages in the region, those that today have literary status in the former
USSR really only gained this in any meaningful sense following the
establishment of Soviet power. Two legends are associated with the
creation of the Georgian script—(a) that it was devised by King Parnavaz
in the 4th/3rd centuries B.C., (b) that Armenian Bishop Mesrop Mashtots
invented it c.400 A.D. along with the Armenian script and that of the «lost»
Caucasian Albanians. Most, however, would concur that it was probably
created some time in the 4th century (Ts'ereteli 1960), on the model of
contemporary Greek (Gamq'relidze 1989), in order to facilitate the spread
of Christianity, introduced in the 330s. The earliest inscription dates from
C.430 at the Georgian church founded by Peter the Iberian in the Judaean
desert near Bethlehem; within Georgia the oldest inscription hails from 494
at the Bolnisi Sion (60 kilometres to the south from Tbilisi).
During its history Georgian has had three scripts, all written from left
to right and lacking the distinction between upper and lower cases: (a) from
the 5th to the 9th century mrg(v)lovani
'rounded' (otherwise called
asomtavruli
'majiscule') was used; (b) from this developed
k'utxovani
'angular' (or nusxuri 'miniscule'), which, having made its first appearance in
the testament appended to the Sinai Polycephalon of 864, continued to be
used for most manuscripts written in the 10th/11th centuries—within such
manuscripts the earlier script was employed in the function of capitals; (c)
the modern mxedruli 'military, secular' script evolved from its predecessor
in the 11th century. However, the Church continued to use the older scripts
for sacred texts, such that the generic term xucuri 'ecclesiastical' came to
be adopted jointly to distinguish them from their mutual descendant. The
modern script has 33 characters and is fully phonemic; Old Georgian used
5 additional characters, which are bracketed in their mxedruli-forms in the
table that follows:INTRODUCTION5Table 2: The Three Scripts of Georgian

1.3 The History of Georgian Philology
The earliest known work in Georgian to deal with philological issues in the
language, namely A Treatise on Articles, was discovered by Mzekala
Shanidze (1984) as part of the 11th-12th century manuscript No.6 from the
collection of the I veron Monastery on Mt. Athos, a work she tentatively
attributes to the scholar Eprem Mtsire. Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725)
produced the first native dictionary in 1716, whilst the first grammar of the6GEORGI AN GRAMMARlanguage written in Georgian belongs to Zurab Shanshovani (1737), followed
in 1753 and 1767 by versions of a more comprehensive description by
Patriarch Ant'on I (1720-1788). A number of grammatical works appeared
through the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was essentially in the
writings of T h e Father of Modern Georgian Philology', Ak'ak'i Shanidze
(February 1887-March 1987), that Georgian grammar finally came of age.
His monumental Fundamentals of the Georgian Language, most recently re­
printed in 1980, will long remain the ultimate reference for all students of
Georgian morphology once they have gained a reading-knowledge of the
language. The Georgian Academy published the 8-volume Explanatory
Dictionary of the Georgian Language (KEGL, in abbreviation of its native
title, viz. kart+ul-i en-is gan+mart'+eb+it-i leksik'on-i) between
1950 and 1964 under the general editorship of Arnold Cikobava, who
contributed his own grammatical sketch in volume 1. I ndeed, it has to be
said that the preparation of this grammar was greatly facilitated by the
invaluable information provided by this magnificent work, for apart from
using the volumes to check the existence and morphology of many of the
verb-forms quoted, I made lavish use of the illustrations included in the
various articles consulted, many of which are quoted as presented, though
in other cases I reduced the content for concentration on the feature in
question. Working so intimately with these volumes over the months, I
came to appreciate even more than I had before just how indispensable
they are for any serious student of Georgian. I know that this dictionary
has been the target of a good deal of criticism over the years, but I am
happy to speak strongly in its defence here. It has the unparalleled
advantage over any other dictionary of Georgian in its inclusion of so much
illustrative material from attested usage. One of the great desiderata in
Kartvelology is for a really good bilingual dictionary including illustrative
material of just this kind, and the first step in any such project would
surely be to render the Georgian definitions in KEGL into some appropriate
second language (like English!) and then to publish the result in a single
volume with a greatly reduced size of font on good quality thin paper, after
the fashion of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. If such a project
could be financed, at least two observations should be borne in mind: (i) the
long quotes from the published works of Stalin that rather burden volumes
1-4 could usefully be pruned or replaced, and (ii) since citations are with
3rd person subject (and object(s)), it is not always possible to predict the
form of a verbal root in some paradigms when the subject (or direct object)
is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. given ga-(Ø-)č'r-a 'X cut Y/them', it is not
possible to predict that 'I cut X/them' is ga-v-(Ø-)č'er-i with root
expanded by -e-), so that this information should either be given as part ofINTRODUCTION7the citation for relevant verbs, or appropriate examples should be included
in the illustrative materials, which goal KEGL does not always achieve—
see the suggestions along these lines I made in Hewitt (1991a). Without
KEGL whatever value the present volume may have would have been
considerably diminished. Useful articles will also be found in the ongoing
series Questions on the Culture of Georgian Speech, whose 9th volume
appeared in 1989. Numerous dialectal words are contained in the various
volumes of Materials on the History of Georgia's Domestic Industry and
Craftsmanship (in Georgian), which began publication in 1976.
Foreign investigation of Georgian began in the 17th century with the
work of Italian missionaries—for the history of the study of Caucasian
languages in general see (the Mingrelian) Arnold Chikobava (1965). In 1629
there were published in Rome the Alphabetum Ihericum, sive Georgianum,
cum Oratione Dominicali and S. Paolini's Georgian-Italian Dictionary. In
1643 M. Maggio followed these with his Georgian Grammar. Facsimiles of
these three bibliographical rarities were published in Tbilisi in 1983 under
the title First Printed Books in Georgian (Xelovneba). F. Bopp, M. Brosset
and H. Schuchardt dealt with aspects of Georgian in the 19th century, and
in 1904 A. Dirr produced his short Theoretisch-praktische Grammatik der
modernen georgischen [grusinischen] Sprache (Leipzig). More recent works
that may be consulted with profit are: G. Deeters Das
kharthwelische
Verbum (Leipzig, 1930), K. Tschenkéli Einführung in die georgische Sprache
Georgisch-Deutsches
(Zürich, 1958) in two volumes, as well as his
Wörterbuch in three volumes (1965-1974), which is easily the most
outstanding of any of the bilingual dictionaries currently available, H. Vogt
Grammaire de la langue géorgienne (Paris, 1971), H. Aronson Georgian—A
Reading Grammar (Chicago, 1982 & 1990)2, H. Fähnrich Kurze Grammatik
der georgischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1986), whilst for Old Georgian there is
this same scholar's 1982 German translation of A. Shanidze's short Grammar
of the Old Georgian Language (both the original (1976) and the translation
published in Tbilisi) as well as in his own right a grammatical sketch of
1991 and now the monograph Grammatik der altgeorgischen
Sprache
(Hamburg, 1994). My own Georgian: A Learner's Grammar (Routledge,
1995b) is now available as a self-tutor for English-speaking readers.
Standing at the intersection of Europe and Asia and occupying an
important strategic position in the Transcaucasus, Georgia has been
regarded as an attractive prize by more powerful peoples since time
immemorial. Græco-Roman, Persian, Arabic, Turkish and, latterly, Russian
influences have all left their traces on the language, especially in respect
of the lexicon. The Academy Dictionary (KEGL) states the provenance of
many foreign lexemes, and in 1964 M. C'abashvili published a dictionary of8GEORGI AN GRAMMARforeign words. The standard reference for Georgian-Iranian linguistic
contacts is the 1966 monograph by Mzia Andronik'ashvili. For ArmenoKartvelian contacts see Vogt (1938 & 1988).
1.4 The Development of the Georgian Literary Language
The natural dynamics of language-change have rendered Modern Georgian
somewhat different from its earliest attested predecessor. Given the
existence of 15 centuries of material, the urge to periodise is strong, and
the standard divisions are: 5th-11th centuries for Old Georgian, 12th-18th
centuries for Mediaeval Georgian, 19th century for the start of Modern
Georgian. However, Sardzhveladze (1984.253-275) counsels caution over
too ready an acceptance of even the basic assumption that clearly defined
breaks can be imposed on what is rather a continuum. He points out that
the period commonly thought of as representing Old Georgian is not itself
linguistically uniform, so that recognition of a certain set of changes would
justify the establishment of at least the two sub-periods (a) 5th-8th and (b)
9th-11th centuries (ibid.269ff.). The problem thereafter is that the extant
texts begin to cover other areas than the purely ecclesiastical, such that
linguistic style is to a degree determined by subject-matter, with ancient
norms prevailing but starting to be rivalled by features from the spoken
language. The Church continued to regard the classical language as the
only appropriate medium for worship and literature, with the result that, as
time passed, the language was being written according to norms that were
becoming ever more out of date and less understood. The move to rid the
literary language of this artificiality and to re-invigorate it by aligning it
with the type of Georgian people actually spoke was part of the general
movement for Georgia's national revival in the latter half of the 19th
century—for the most recent account of this period see Suny (1989.113­
MS; reprinted 1994). The most prominent supporter of modernisation was
the writer and political activist, Prince Ilia C'avc'avadze (1837-1907), who
is now universally regarded as the 'Father of the modern Georgian nation'
and who was canonised by the Georgian Church on the 150th anniversary
of his birth.
1.5 Georgian Literature
The first native work of Georgian literature (i.e. other than translations)
was Iak'ob Tsurt'aveli's Martyrdom of St. Shushanik (šušanik'is c'ameba),
which, though written between the years 476 and 483, has come down to us
in manuscripts that date from no earlier than the 10th century—aINTRODUCTION9monumental 7-language edition was published in Tbilisi in 1983 (Xelovneba).
The oldest dated manuscript thus far discovered is the Sinai Polycephalon
of 864. The oldest dated manuscript of any part of the Bible is that of the
Adysh Gospels, named after the small Svanetian village in which it was
discovered in the 19th century; its date is 897, and it was copied in the
Shat'berd monastery, one of the most important cultural centres in
Mediaeval Georgia's south-western province of K'lardzheti (present-day E.
Turkey). The most famous work of the mediaeval period is, of course, Shota
Rust(a)veli's great epic The Man in the Panther's Skin (in Georgian
vepxist'q'aosani), composed c.1200 A.D. in Georgia's Golden Age under
Queen Tamar (1184-1213). It consists of 1598 quatrains, end-rhyming for
the final two or three syllables, the best English translation of which is
undoubtedly that by Marjory Wardrop (1912 & 1966). Mention should also
be made of the chronicles known as kartlis cxovreba 'History of Georgia'
(literally 'Life of Kartli'), an English translation of part of which is now
available (Vivian 1991). The three most important literary figures of the
late 19th, early 20th century were Ilia C'avč'avadze, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli
(1840-1915), and Vazha Pshavela, pseudonym of Luk'a Razik'ashvili (18611915), all perhaps best loved for their poetical works and affectionately
known in Georgia by merely their Christian names. The finest prose-writer
of this century is deemed by many to be the Mingrelian K'onst'ant'ine
Gamsaxurdia (1891-1975), who, like Pasternak, spoke out against, and yet
somehow survived, the purges of the 'thirties—others would perhaps award
this accolade to Mixeil Dzhavaxishvili, who did not survive the purges. For
a summary of Georgian history, both political and cultural, see Salia (1975),
whilst Rayfield (1994) provides an encyclopaedic reference-guide to
Georgian literature.
1.6 Demography
According to the 1989 Soviet census there were 3,983,115 «Georgians» in
the USSR, of whom 3,787,393 resided in Georgia, where they comprised
70.1%of the republic's population. However, this total is misleading. In the
1926 census 242,990 citizens declared Mingrelian nationality, and 13,218
Svan nationality. Sometime thereafter, probably around 1930, it seems to
have been decided that these peoples were to be reclassified as
«Georgians», with the result that these minor nationalities simply
disappeared from subsequent censuses. Although in 1989 individuals again
had the right to describe themselves as belonging to the nationality they,
rather than officialdom, deemed appropriate, very few chose (for whatever
reason) to deviate from the post-1926 orthodoxy. One consequence of this10GEORGI AN GRAMMARis that there are no accurate figures for the Svan, Mingrelian and Laz
populations of Georgia, though 40,000 plus is usually quoted for Svans, and
up to one million for Mingrelians. More serious for the linguist is the
absence of data on the strength of native-speaker knowledge of all four
Kartvelian languages within Georgia. During the Soviet period all Svans as
well as the vast majority of Mingrelians and Georgians (proper) have been
educated through the medium of Georgian. The status of Georgian as the
local literary lingua franca together with the facts that (a) Georgian,
Mingrelian, Laz and Svan clearly derive from a common source, and (b)
their speakers generally share a long Christian tradition within the
Georgian Orthodox Church appears to be the main argument in defence of
viewing these peoples as one «Georgian» race. The origin of this confused
thinking is perhaps to be sought in the Georgian language itself. A
Georgian calls himself kart-v-el-i
(cf. sa-kart-v-el-o 'Georgia'),
whereas anything non-human but Georgian is kart-ul-i. The Georgian
expression for 'Kartvelian languages' is kart-v-el-ur-i
en-eb-i.
Regrettably, the language lacks the equivalent epithet for humans (*kartv-el-el-i ), with the result that kart-v-el-i 'Georgian' remains the (as
yet!) only available description. Since in English both 'Kartvelian' and
'Georgian' exist, there is no reason to overload the latter with an illogical
ambiguity.
Any attempt to argue for the non-Georgian status of
Mingrelians and Svans regularly excites a ferocious response in Georgia
(for details see Hewitt 1995a). Could this be the result of an exaggerated
desire to present their nation as more numerous (and thus stronger) than it
actually is? How else does one explain the fact that even the few thousand
North Central Caucasian Bats (Ts'ova-Tush) people, who reside exclusively
in the K'ax(et)ian village of Zemo Alvani and whose mother-tongue is in no
way related to Georgian, are equally fiercely portrayed as «Georgians» (cf.
Itonishvili 1990)? For a recent etymology of the ethnonym-root kart-v-,
which derives it from the more familiar ethnonym 'Parthian', see Shanidze
(1978).
Though united as a great feudal power from the time of David IV
(nicknamed 'The Builder', 1089-1125) through the «Golden Age» under
Queen Tamar (1184-1213) to the appearance of the Mongols in the second
quarter of the 13th century, the concept of Georgia as a single socio­
political unit did not really exist again until the birth of the revivalistmovement in the latter half of the 19th century, alluded to above. Thus,
despite its long and distinguished literary tradition, one could argue that
Georgia is quite a young nation. Despite frequent inter-regional feuding in
the past the one thing that the Georgians have always had in common is
their language, and a plausible case could be made for saying that theirINTRODUCTION11pride in, and loyalty towards, their language have contributed greatly in
helping to ensure the survival of the nation in the face of all the perils
thrown up by history. At the same time, though, such devotion can be
taken to extremes. The belief is widespread that the language suffered
repression from Russia in favour of Russian throughout the Soviet period
(1921-1991), whereas, in contradistinction to the treatment meted out to
Georgian through much of the period of Tsarist rule in the 19th century,
more objective observers would surely conclude that Georgian was given
the opportunity actually to flourish during those 70 Soviet years when it
benefited from enjoying the constitutional status as the state-language of
one of the USSR's constituent republics (Hewitt 1985, 1989a), with universal
publishing of both newspapers and books, radio- and televisionbroadcasting, and the possibility of completing the educational process
from kindergarten through university in the mother-tongue. When in 1978
the first draft for the Brezhnevite constitution made no specific mention of
Georgian being the main republican language, demonstrations forced the
then 1st Secretary, Eduard Shevardnadze, to remedy the omission, as one
may see by consulting Article 75. However, not everyone in Georgia
speaks Georgian, even as a 2nd (or 3rd) language. Consider the 1989
census-data:

the main means of communication is Russian, followed by Mingrelian, since
the vast majority of the 239,872 Kartvelians resident here at the time were
in fact Mingrelians. I n those areas where Mingrelians were found
(predominantly in the southern half of the autonomous republic) the nonKartvelian locals have traditionally had 2nd or 3rd language command of it.
Since Georgian was little heard here, only those who attended Georgianlanguage schools (viz. the Kartvelians) could naturally be expected to have
had a good knowledge of it. In the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast'
(Region) Georgians were in a clear minority, as shewn by the 1989 censusdata:

1.01.7 The Language-issue
Just as the position of the Georgian language played an important role in
the 19th century revivalist movement, so it soon surfaced again at the time
of nationalist stirrings in the wake of the weakening of authoritarian
controls from Moscow in the late 1980s. The first draft of T h e State
Programme for the Georgian Language', published in November 1988,INTRODUCTION13contained three crucial clauses proposing:
(13) The creation in all institutions and enterprises of favourable conditions
for citizens of non-Georgian nationality living in the republic to master the
Georgian language;
(111 10) The working out of proposals concerning the possibility of
introducing in the republic's non-Georgian (Russian, Armenian,
Azerbaydzhani, Abxazian and Ossetic) schools Georgian-language teaching
according to obligatory rule;
(111 16) The introduction of theoretical and practical courses in the
Georgian language at Georgia's higher educational establishments in the
faculties of Russian language and literature, Abxazian language and
literature, Ossetic language and literature, Armenian language and
literature, and Azeri language and literature.
In the final draft, ratified by the Georgian government in August 1989,
these three clauses were altered to read as follows:
(16) The creation in all institutions and enterprises (with financial and
teaching-methodological safeguards) of favourable conditions for citizens
living within the republic who have no knowledge of the Georgian language
to master the Georgian language;
(11113) The working out of concrete proposals concerning the introduction
of the obligatory teaching of the Georgian language in the republic's nonGeorgian schools;
(11114) The introduction of an oral test in Georgian language and literature
prior to entrance-exams for prospective students of non-Georgian sectors
at the higher educational establishments of the Georgian SSR;
(111 15) The introduction of courses in the practical stylistics of the
Georgian language and the history of Georgian language and literature in
the non-Georgian sectors of the philology faculty at the higher educational
establishments of the Georgian SSR.
The director of the Linguistics Institute of the Georgian Academy of
Sciences at the time said as an apparent after-thought at the end of a
television-discussion to celebrate The Programme's promulgation that the14GEORGI AN GRAMMARnon-Kartvelian population should in no way feel threatened by these
proposals, which, he claimed, were only designed to facilitate their learning
of Georgian. It is clear, however, that, whether an individual nonKartvelian felt he needed it or not for his daily life and work, he was going
to be forced to learn Georgian at the school of his choice and would have
to achieve a certain proficiency in it if he wished to receive higher
education in what has always been a multi-ethnic republic. If these
requirements are considered in conjunction with populist suggestions at the
time that knowledge of Georgian should be one of the pre-requisities for
obtaining citizenship in an independent Georgia, one will perhaps judge the
post-1988 apprehensions among many of the non-Kartvelians (especially
Abxazians 5 , Ossetes, Armenians and Azerbaydzhanis) in Georgia to be fully
justified. Hitherto Georgian language had been merely an optional subject
in the republic's Russian, Armenian, Azerbaydzhani, Ossetic and Abxazian
schools (for details see Hewitt 1989a).
If the proposition advanced above is correct, namely that the troubles
that began in 1989 sprang at least in part from the nationalists' forced
promotion of Georgian through The State Programme, then one could
conclude that a wiser step would have been to draw up a detailed
statement as to how all of the languages of this small, cosmopolitan land
would be safeguarded in a sovereign Georgia. In this way respect for
language could have become a source of unity rather than a factor in the
discord which led to the ferocious war in South Ossetia under the
Gamsaxurdia regime and the even bloodier conflict in Abxazia (August
1992-September 1993), as a result of which both these provinces are today
(1995) de facto independent of a disintegrating Georgia. As it is, the
continuing welfare of Georgian can hardly be doubted, though the same
cannot be said for its sister-languages Svan, Mingrelian and Laz, whose
only mention in The State Programme is in connection with their meriting
the same rights of study as Georgian's dialects proper. However, at the
time of writing it is not the continued viability of these languages that is at
issue but the very viability of the Republic of Georgia itself!
1.8 Scope of the present work
Though the general linguist will, I trust, find in the following pages
whatever he may desire to know about the workings of the Georgian
language, as it now stands this book represents my attempt to consign to
paper in the form of a fully-fledged reference grammar all the knowledge
of (as well as, I hope, the odd insight into) this challenging language that I
have acquired over the last twenty years of close study. Because of theINTRODUCTION15structure of the language it is no accident that the largest chapter below is
that devoted to the morphology of the verb. However, I have endeavoured
to give the fullest possible information also about the language's syntax,
since this is an area that is often cursorily treated, especially by native
linguists in the Caucasus.
The chapter on syntax begins with a
recapitulation of the essentials of the overall properties of the language
discussed in chapters 3 and 4, so that those primarily interested in
questions of syntax might be able to derive some benefit from the syntactic
descriptions presented in chapter 5 without necessarily having to master
all of the complex morphology that precedes them.
With the publication of my course-book for Georgian in twenty lessons
for Routledge (1995b) and the imminent appearance of my Georgian Reader
(SOAS), I now draw this chapter in my linguistic endeavours to a close,
leaving it to others to work on this language in the certainty that its future
is fully secure; henceforth I shall concentrate on at least two of the
languages in the Caucasus about whose future the same happy prediction
can sadly not be made, namely Abxaz and Mingrelian—the irony is, one
could argue, that it is in the very success of Georgian that the threat to
these languages and cultures lies.
1.9 Principles of Citation
All words are divided into constituent morphemes. Morpheme-boundaries
are indicated either by the hyphen or a plus-sign, the latter (+) being used
either when the identity of each morpheme is not important to the
particular phenomenon being explained (and thus they are not individually
glossed in those instances where morpheme-analyses are provided) or when
it is suspected that a morpheme-boudary is present but the precise analysis
might be unclear. For example, we could gloss each component of the Past
Participle 'baked' thus:
ga-mo-m-cxv-ar-i
Preverb-Preverb-Past.Participle.Prefix-bake-Past.Participle.SuffixAgreement.Marker
but it would normally be important only to know that this word is a verbal
adjective meaning 'baked', and it would therefore usually be presented
simply as:
ga+mo+m+cxv+ar-i
baked-AGR
'baked'
To illustrate the second case let us take the verbal noun (Masdar) of
the copula, q'+op+n-a, where the Masdar-formant is the final -a.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

Combinations of real protasis with unreal apodosis (or vice versa) are
normally regarded as solœcisms, such as, for example, the English '(?) If

GEORGIAN,however, are quite common. The protasis consists of rom +
Aorist SUBJunctive, whilst the apodosis contains the Future Indicative, e.g.

This coupling of the conditional markers, always in this order, is not
unknown. In the first two of the following examples it is the tu which
determines the (real) nature of the conditional, whilst in the third it is rom

522.1.4.4 'On condition that'
The main clause contains the words i+m p'ir+ob-it that
condition-INST
'on condition', whilst the subordinate clause begins with the complementiser588GEORGIANGRAMMARrom 'that' accompanied by the Future Indicative for future reference or
the Pluperfect for past reference, e.g.

For reference to the future the main verb here would be da-tan+xmd-eb-i-an 'they will agree', whilst the subordinate verb would become
mo-(Ø-)u-va 'it will come to him'.
5.2.2.1.5 Concession
Esšentially there are two conjunctions that mark concession: tu+mc(a)
'although' is found with non-SUBJunctive verbs, whilst tu+nd(+a(+c)) 'even
if' is principally used in association with the Prešent SUBJunctive for
prešent concessions, with the Aorist SUBJunctive for future concessions, or
with the Pluperfect Indicative for past concessions. The latter conjunction
is analysable as tu 'if', the modal particle u+nd+a 'it is necessary', and -c
'even', which element occurs on a number of subordinating conjunctions and
pronouns to distinguish them from their interrogative variants—sometimes
this clitic attaches to some other word within the clause rather than to the
concessive conjunction itself. In addition to tu, the former conjunction
contains the now obsolete formant -mc(a), whose role in OldGEORGIANwas
to lend a šense of non-factuality to the indicative with which it was
construed. Examples:
tu+nd xvale
mo-m-k'1-a-n,
even.if tomorrow PREV-me-kIII-AOR.SUBJ-theya r m-e-nagvl-eb-a

A non-finite reprešentation employs the adposition mi+u+xed+av+ad
'disregarding, despite', which is the Adverbial case of the Privative
Participle of the verb mi+xed+v+a 'behold, look thither, look to', in
association with the Genitive of the 3rd person deictic demonstrative
pronoun acting as cataphor to a noun-clause introduced by rom, e.g.
mi+u+xed+av+ad i+m-isa, rom gare + t civ-a,

ga-v-di-v-a+r

'Despite the fact that it is cold outside, I am stIII going out'
5.2.2.1.6 Manner
The simplest construction has ro+gor+c 'as' (cf. interrogative ro+gor?
'how?') introducing an indicative verb, the order of the two clauses being
irrelevant, e.g.
ro+gor+c
šen
g-e-p'rian-eb-a,
as
you(DAT) you-IOV-appeal-TS-it
mo-(Ø-)i-kec-i
PREV-(you-)PASS-act-AOR.INDIC(=I MPER)
'Act as the fancy takes you'i+s + e
soIf the correlative is i + m + gvar + ad(-ve) 'in (just) that way', the
manner-clause will be introduced by ro+gor+ada+c, whilst a parallel
correlative-conjunctional coupling is i+m+nair+ad(-ve)...ra+nair+ada+c.
If the above reprešent factual clauses of manner, the situation is
somewhat different in the case of hypothetical manner-clauses. The
subordinating conjunction is t+i+tk+o(+s) 'as if, as though', which derives
from tu i+tkv+a 'if it was/is said' or tu i+tkv+a+s 'if it transpires that it
is said'. The conjunction permits three constructions: (a) the verb will be in
that tense of the indicative which is appropriate to the demands of the
main verb; (b) the Prešent SUBJunctive may replace the Prešent Indicative if59ØGEORGIANGRAMMARthe main verb is non-past, whilst the III rd SUBJunctive may replace an
Aorist Indicative or Perfect that would have occurred in the putative
original direct speech, regardless of the tense of the main verb; (c) given
the prešence of a form of the verb 'say' within the conjunction, the clause
may reflect the reporting of original speech (or thought) by coupling the
speech-particle -o with the words originally spoken (or thought), e.g.
sax-is
ga+mo+me+t'q'v+el+eb+a i+s+e+t-i

5.2.2.1.7 Time
5.2.2.1.7.1'when'
The basic temporal conjunctions are the fully interchangeable
r(+)o+de+sa+c and r(+)o+ca 'when' (cf. interrogative r( + )o + di+s?
'when?'), either of which will stand at the start of a clause containing an
indicative verb, e.g.
r(+)o+de+sa+c / / r(+)o+ca mo-x-val,
šen-i
when
PREV-you-come(FuT) your-AGR
da-c
mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e
sister(NOM)-too PREV-(you-her-)SV-bring-AOR.INDIC(=IMPER)
'When you come, bring your sister too'
Examples may also be found of causal ra+k'i and manner ro+gor
appearing in contexts where it seems more appropriate to translate them
as 'when'.
The general subordinator rom is frequently used, especially in speech,
in a temporal šense, so that the subordinate clause in the above-example
could be replaced by:
šen / /
you(NOM)a+k
hererom

5.1.8.1.3 Di transí ti ve Verbs
When a ditransitive verb is made causative, the subject of the embedded
ditransitive becomes indirect object of the matrix causative, the embedded
indirect object becomes an oblique object governed by the usual
postposition -tvis Tor', whilst the embedded direct object remains in the
direct object role, e.g.
mo+c'ap+e-m
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s
vaäl-i
pupil-ERGA
teacher-DATB
apple-NOMB
mi-(Ø-)s-c-a

T h e parents made the pupil give an/the apple to the/a teacher'
When a verb such as this last occurs in a Series III screeve, two of
the array of arguments have to be dependent on the postposition -tvis:
m+š+ob+l-eb-s
mo+c'ap-is-tvis
vaäl-i

In both instances we note that the causee precedes the similarly
marked embedded indirect object in terms of word-order.
5.1.8.2 Analytic Causatives
If the verb i(+)jul-eb-a 'causing' fulfils the function of matrix causative
verb, then the embedded verb will normally stand either in the Aorist
Subjunctive (sc. after a non-past main verb) or in the Pluperfect (sc. after
a past main verb), e.g.
xalx-ma
me+p+e
(Ø-)a-i(+)jul-a

The people forced the king (a) to flee, (b) to abandon the queen, (c) to

N.B. In OldGEORGIANthe Transitive verb i(+)jul-eb-a was construed
with a subject, indirect object for the causee and an 'infinitive' (viz. the
Masdar in the Adverbial case) with its own arguments to reprešent the
embedded clause, e.g.
(Ø-Ø-)a-i(+)jul-es

Noun- and adjective-complements of the copula stand in the Nominative
case, the copula usually following or, if 3rd person singular, attached to
the predicate in its reduced form, e.g.
čem-i
mezobel-i (a) mgvdel-i
a+r-i-s
(/mgvdel-i-a)
my-AGR neighbour-NOM priest-NOM
be-PRES-3rd.PER
(b) tav+xed-i
a+r-i-s
(/tav+xed-i-a)
arrogant-NOM
'My neighbour is (a) a priest (b) arrogant'
The same is true of ga-xd-om-a 'becoming', e.g.
q'vela-s-gan
all-GEN-fromtit-it
finger-INSTsa+šven+eb+el-i
ga-xd-eb-i-an
to.be.pointed.out-NOM PREV-become-TSINDIC(FuT)-they

verb:
ga-(Ø-)xd-i-t
PREV-(you-)become-AOR.INDIC(=lMPER)-Pl
m+sax+ur-ad
servant-ADV
'Become a true servant of the nation!'er-is
č'ešmarit'
nation-GEN trueIn a colloquialism meaning 'be able to' in explicitly or implicitly negative
šentences it is the Dative that forms the complement of this verb, e.g.
ra-s
what-DATga-xd-eb-od-a? —
PREV-become-TS-I MPERF(=CONDI T)-Xvera(+per)-s
nothing(POT)DAT(sc. ga-xd-eb-od-a)
'What would X have been able to do?—(sc. X could have done) nothing'
Cf. 5.1.7 above for other Intransitive verbs coupled with unusual Dative
arguments and see 5.1.13.2 below for a possible explanation.
If the Future Participle combines with an adjective like advil-i 'easy'562GEORGIANGRAMMARas part of the complement, it may either remain as part of the Nominative
predicate, e.g.
sxv-is
gul-5i

FuT.PTC-findFuT.PTC-NOMar

be-PRES-it

or it may be placed in the Adverbial case, leaving the adjective advil-i
alone to function as the immediate complement of the copula, e.g.
...advil-i ar a+r-i-s sa-p'ov+n-el-ad
A similar phenomenon occurs when this participle is construed with the
verbs q'+ol-a 'having (someone)' and k+on-a 'having (something)', e.g.
sad-me
g-a-kv-s
c'a-sa-svl-el-i/

5.1.9.1 Apposition
Straightforward noun- and adjective-complements might be viewed as a
type of apposition. When standing in clear apposition to some noun, the
relevant adjective will take on the same cašending as that noun, e.g.

verb:

bow=arrow-GEN victim-ADV
PREV-you-make-TS(lst.PER.
FuT)
'I shall make you a victim of my bow and arrow'5.1.1Ø Reflexives
In the abšence of a distinct reflexive pronoun, the noun tav-i 'head'
(always in the singular) serves as surrogate, preceded, should emphasis be
required, by the possessive pronoun that is coreferential with the
controlling subject. For Indirect Verbs the control is the 'logical' subject in
the Dative, just as it is the Dative noun in Series III of Transitive and
Medial Verbs, e.g.
(šen-s)
tav-s
mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'l-av?
your-AGR head-DAT PREV-(you-it-)SV-kIII-TS(FuT)
'will you kIII yourself?'
(me)
(dem-i) tav-i
m-i-q'var-s
I(DATB) my-AGR head-NOMA IB-OV-love-itA
'I love myself
The form of the possessive adjective in the case of 3rd person
reflexives will be the adjective built on the Genitive case of t a v - i
'head/self, namely tav+is-i 'his/her/its own', if the singular is required,
otherwise tav+ian+t-i 'their own' in the plural (though even in the plural
tav+is-i is not unknown), e.g.
sark'e-ši (tav+ian+t) tav-s
da-(Ø-)i-nax-av-en
mirror-in their.own
head-DAT PREV-(it-)SV-notice-TS(FuT)-they
They will notice themselves in the mirror'
It is not only subjects that may act as the control for the use of these
reflexive possessives, e.g.","[577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582]"

"217VERBAl MORPHOlOGY4.7Screeve-formationSeries I, II and III screeves will now be described in this order for each
of the five verb-classes (Transitive, Intransitive, Medial, Indirect, Stative).
Series III Intransitive, Indirect and Stative screeves incorporate either
the Masdar or Past Participle of the relevant root—the formation of
Masdars is explained in 4.9.1, that of Past Participles in 4.9.5.
4.7.1 Transitive Class (garda+ma+val-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
The Transitive Class includes some verbs which are not today construed
with any external direct object (e.g. bavšv-ma mo-(?0-)šard-a 'the baby
urinated', mo+lar+e-m a-(?0-)i-xed-a 'the cashier looked up'). At some
stage in the history of the language these verbs will have been associated
with a direct object, which over time was dropped because of its
predictability; indeed, for the second verb illustrated above we have a
virtual synonym in OldGEORGIANshewing that the direct object will have
been 'eyes', thereby accounting for the prešence in the verb of the
Subjective Version (viz. John 17.1:
iesuag-(Ø-)i-xil-n-aJesus(ERG) PREV-(3rd.PER-)SV-look-Pl-he(AOR)tual-n-i
eye-Pl-NOMtu+is-n-i
zeca-d 3 6
own-Pl-NOM heaven-ADV
'Jesus look up = raised his eyes heavenwards'),
whilst for the first verb above one can assume some sort of internal object
as äard-l//ps+el-i 'urine'. No finiteGEORGIANverb-form exists without
the prešence of at least a Set A agreement-affix. In Series III the agent
of Transitive Verbs stands in the Dative and is taken up in the verb-form
by a Set B affix. This leaves the remaining Set A affix clearly pointing to
the (notional and/or historical) prešence of the direct object now missing
with these seemingly Intransitive verbs, e.g.
mo+lar+e-s a-(Ø-)u-xed-av-s
cahier-DAT PREV-(she-)OV-look.up-?3rd.PER(PERF)
'the cashier (has) apparently looked up'
It is because of such verbal morphology and because of the Ergative
subject-marking for these verbs in Series 11 that they are defined as
Transitive. The same applies to those verbs which, despite lacking a direct218GEORGIANGRAMMARobject, nevertheless take an indirect object, e.g.
mela-m
čit'-is
bude-s
mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-o
fox-ERG bird-GEN nest-DAT PREV-(?3rd.PER-it-)lV-locate-it(AOR)
'the fox located the bird's nest'
=> Perfect:
mela-s
čit'-is
bud-is-tvis
mi-(Ø-)u-gn-i-?a
fox-DAT bird-GEN nest-GEN-for PREV-(it-)OV-locate-PERF?3rd.PER
'the fox (has) apparently located the bird's nest'
cf. ga+m+svl+el-eb-ma gad-mo-(?0-)m-xed-es 'the passers-by looked
over at me' vs ga+m+svl+el-eb-s gad-mo-(Ø-)u-xed-av-t čem-tvis
'the passers-by apparently (have) looked over at me').
1st and IInd Series screeves will be prešented in their simplest
Versional form, which will usually, of course, be the Neutral Version. Other
Versions will be prešented and commented upon only where some particular
point needs to be made.
4.7.1.1 Series I (p'irvel-i seria)
The subject stands in the Nominative and correlates in the verb-form with
a Set A agreement-affix. Both the direct and indirect objects stand in the
Dative and correlate in the verb-form with a Set B agreement-affix.
4.7.1.1.1 Prešent Sub-Series
Preverbs are typically abšent from the three screeves of this sub-series.
However, there are instances when a preverb will be found.
4.7.1.1.1.1 Prešent Indicative (ac'+m+q'+o)
This screeve of the indicative mood (txr+ob+it-i k'ilo), which is used as
equivalent to English 'X VERBs' or 'X is VERBing' and sometimes 'X is going
to VERB', is formed by adding the appropriate agreement-affixes to a base
consisting of Version Vowel (which will be zero for some verbs in Neutral
Version) plus Root plus Thematic Suffix (sc. other than in the case of Root
Verbs). The 3rd person singular subject-marker is universally -s, which
changes to -en in the plural, except for verbs with Thematic Suffix -i,
which require 3rd person plural subjects to be marked by the allomorph
-an. Basic paradigms are set out according to the so-called 'subjectconjugation', which means that the direct object is kept constant in the 3rdVERBAl MORPHOlOGY219person (with its zero-marking on the verb), whilst the subject varies for
person and number in the canonical fashion for inflecting Indo-European
languages.
Thematic Suffix -eb
This is the commonest of the Thematic Suffixes, and most verbs of this
sub-type have Neutral Version marked by a-. Most verbs formed on nounor adjective-roots belong here, and indeed this pattern of verb-formation
remains productive, all such denominšis taking Neutral Version in a-.
Examples: garib-i 'poor' => (Ø-Ø-)a-garib-eb 'you impoverish X/them',
g m e r t - i 'god' => (Ø-Ø-)a-gmert-eb 'you deify X/them'; if the root
syncopates, it will tend to do so, though gmert- clearly does not reduce to
gvt- (e.g. c'itei-i 'red' => (Ø-Ø-)a-c'itl-eb 'you redden X/them'). If a
root ends in -a or -o, a - v - intervenes between this and any suffixal
vowel in the verb (e.g. b r m a 'blind' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-brma-v-eb 'you
(will) blind X/them', parto 'broad' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-parto-v-eb 'you (will)
broaden X/them'); if the root ends in -e, it drops (e.g. m c V a n e 'green' =>
(a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mc'van-eb 'you (will) make X/them green', m e + p + e
'sovereign' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-me+p-eb 'you (will) make X/them sovereign').
Some distinctions will later be made depending upon whether the root has a
vowel or is vowelless, as in (Ø-Ø-)d-eb 'you put X/them', (Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb
'you open X/them'.

"128GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.1 Pronominalagreement-affixesThe two sets of agreement-affixes, with the hyphen shewing their position
relative to the stem, are now prešented. The affixes are pronominal in
function and are prešent whether or not the NPs, possibly consisting of just
a personal pronoun, with which they correlate appear within the clause as
external arguments. As an absolute minimum aGEORGIANverb-form must
contain at least one Set A affix in addition to the root:
Affixai Agreement-Set A

0 ( / s / h ) - (-t)7The affixes of Set A are used to mark the subject with Intransitive verbs
in all screeves, whilst for Transitives and Medišis they mark the subject
for the various screeves of Series I and 11 —what happens in Series 111 for
Transitives and Medišis and with Indirect verbs in general will be
described later. l e t us take as model of an Intransitive verb the passive
stem -i-k'vl-eb- 'be killed' (consisting of the Subjective Version vowel in
its role as passive-marker followed by the root followed by a Thematic
Suffix) and illustrate subject-marking in the Prešent, Future and Aorist
Indicatives:
Prešent
v-i-k'vl-eb-i
'I am being killed'Future
mo-v-i-k'vl-eb-i
'I shall be killed'Aorist

'I was killed'We see that with no preverb, as in the Prešent, the subject pronominal
affix of the 1st person stands first in the complex, preceding any preradical vowel that may be used, whereas it follows any preverb(s) that may
be prešent. If the subject is plural, then the pluralising exponent -t is
added at the end of the complex, to give:129VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

'you were killed'Which of the various allomorphs for marking 3rd person subjects is
actually selected depends on the screeve and/or type of verb involved, as
will be explained as each type is described in detail below. The 3rd person
equivalents to the above are:

'they were killed'If we take the root 'kill' but this time as part of a transitive stem, we
can demonstrate subject-marking for a Transitive verb—the prešence of
the zero-morph from the Set B affixal set in the following verb-forms points
to the prešence of a 3rd person direct object (singular or plural):

- e n is selected in the Prešent and Future vs - e s in the Aorist.
Prescriptively, only a 3rd person human plural noun will impose its plurality
on the verb, other 3rd person plurals selecting the 3rd person singular
agreement-suffix, e.g.

let us now turn to the Set B affixes. First we note that to mark 3rd
person direct objects the zero-allomorph alone is used and that
prescriptively the plurality of such 3rd person direct objects is never
indicated, though in practice one does come across such examples as:
e+s

(3rd.PER-)NV-interest-TS-Plin place of the prescriptively 'correct' e+s (ma-t) (Ø-)a-int'erese b - s 1 2 . let us keep constant the 3rd person singular subject and see how
the object is indicated for 'kill' in the Prešent, Future and Aorist:
Prešent
m-k'l-av-s
'X kills me'
g-k'1-av-s
'X kills you'
(Ø-)k'l-av-s
'X kills Y'

'X killed Y'
mo-gv-k'1-a
'X killed us'
mo-g-k'1-a-t
'X killed you Pl'
mo-(Ø-)k'l-a
'X killed them'The affixes are seen to occupy the same positions relative to the other
exponents as do the affixes of Set A. Where both the 3rd person singular
subject-suffix and the direct object pluraliser are prešent, they occur in
this order (as in the sequence -a-t here from the Aorist). But where the
expected sequence is -s-t (as in earlier forms ofGEORGIANwe would here
have had (mo-)g-k'l-av-s-t 'X kills (will kill) you PI.'), the Set A subjectsuffix is deleted. As to the number of the 3rd person object, it is left to
the context to determine whether forms like (Ø-)k'l-av-s etc.. are
construed with a singular or plural direct object.
We now have to consider how this picture is complicated when
combinations other than with 3rd person singular subject occur. Assuming
that a subject-prefix would indeed precede a direct object-prefix, the
sequence of v - g - anticipated for a meaning like 'I kill you' is never
realised because the subject-affix is dropped before the object-marker
-g-, viz.","[146, 147, 148, 149, 150]"
"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY
55Ø7This desiderative is not actually quoted as an existing form in the Academy
Dictionary (KEGL), which is why I have prefaced it with a question-mark for this
particular sense — the form may convey any of the meanings 'it is being written
for/to/on me' without difficulty, though in these instances it is classified as a bivalent
I ntransitive.
6
Always assuming that Georgian is correctly described as having such an aspectual
system — for doubts see Rayfield (1994a).
7
For information on the pluraliser - q ' e found in some dialects see the relevant
sections of Tuite (1991) or Tuite (1989).
8
The final i-vowel in these forms is a marker of the indicative mood.
9
Some might prefer suppletion to v-i-xoc-eb-i-t
when the underlying patient is
plural.
10 The only screeves today retaining the voiceless back fricative, which was once the
universal 2nd person subject indicator, are: the Present of the copula = x-a+r(-t)
'you (you Pl..) are', and, for the verb of motion, which is here shewn with the preverb
mo-, the Future Indicative = mo-x-val(-t) 'you (vou Pl.) will come', the Conditional =
mo-x-vid-od-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) would (have) come', the Future Subjunctive ro(m)
mo-x-vid-od-e(-t) 'if you (you(PU) were to come', the Aorist Indicative = m o - x ved-i(-t) 'you (you Pl.) came', and the Aorist Subjunctive = ro(m) mo-x-vid-e(-t)
'in order that you (you Pl.) may come'. ,
11. Changes to the root will be explained at the appropriate time.
12 The following examples come from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo

13 This h- used also to be found before - b , and it sometimes still occurs in this context.
Volume 8 of KEGL, for instance, gives the entry-form é a - h - b a r - d - e b - a PREV3rd.PER-be.entrusted-PASS-TS-X(FUT)
X will be entrused to Y'. The Dictionary of
Morphemes and Modal Elements, published in 1988, also quotes such forms as da-hbzu-i-s 'X buzzes over Y', whereas KEGL volume III, published in 1953, cites this
latter verb without the h - .
14 These two zero-morphs represent respectively 2nd person subject and 3rd person
direct object. I arbitrarily assume throughout this work that the affixal ordering is
subject-direct object-indirect object.
15 The switch in preverb is dealt with below (4.3).
16 In Old Georgian plurals in -n- always imposed their plurality on the verb.
17 There is a homonymous Indirect Verb usually used in conjunction with a negative to
mean 'have' (e.g. ara+per-i ar m-e-bad-eb-a
nothing-NOM not I-I OV-have-TSit(FUT) 'I shall have nothing', which in the Present I ndicative would be m - a - b a d - i a), but in the present instance we are dealing with the dynamic bipersonal passive of
the root -bad- 'give birth'.
18 Masdars are usually construed with the relevant preverb.
19 Both variant-masdars (abstract-nouns) are employed by KEGL in the explanation
offered of the entry-form i-rb-en-s 'X will run', namely: si-rb-il-it i-vl-i-s, r b en-it c'a-va=c'a-mo-va 'X will move about running, X will go and come away
running'.
20 The presence of a 1st or 2nd person direct object with a root that is construed with
mi- does not of course occasion any such substitution (e.g. gvino t'k'b+il-ad mim-a-jin-eb-s 'wine will sweetly lull me to sleep').","[525, 526]"

Is the juxtaposing of these two Genitives facilitated here because the
phrase xm-is ga-c-em-a is regarded as a tight-knit verbal phrase
meaning 'speaking to'?
If a finite verb-form governs the Instrumental, this case remains in use
alongside the relevant Masdar, e.g.

then the first Genitive reprešents the intransitive subject and the second

In the following two examples the first shews an objective Genitive with
c d - a 'attempt', the second a subjective Genitive with this same

Apart from the clitic - c 3 and the adverb a+gr+e+t+ve, both meaning 'too,

prefixal passives, particularly in the Prešent, often inherently convey
the concept of potentiality. When they are so used, prescriptive grammar
requires they be negated not by the (now pleonastic) potential ver but by
the unmarked ar, e.g.
gvino
ar (Ø-)e-sm-ev-a
wine(NOM) not (X-)IOV-drink-TS-it
'X cannot drink wine'
though in practice ver is not unknown.5.1.14.3 unmarked
The neutral marker of negation is ar. Two points not already mentioned
need to be stressed about the function of this element. Past statements
which would be expressed by a verb in the Aorist Indicative if positive
switch to the Perfect when negated by ar, e.g.
šen-s
dge-ši ar ša-mo-(Ø-)m-rč-en-i-x-a+r
your-AGR day-in not PREV-PREV-(you-)me-lag.behind-TS-PERFyou-be
brj-ol-a-ši
battle-TS-MASD-in
'In your day you did not fall short of me in battle'
This does not mean that the Aorist Indicative is never found with ar;
this coupling, however, conveys the nuance that the subject had no wish to
carry out the past action and in fact declined to carry it out, e.g.
p'olit'ik'+ur-i mizez-it
ar mi-(Ø-)i-g-es
political-AGR
reason-INST not PREV-(X-)SV-receive-they(AOR)
'For political reasons they refused to accept X'
5.1.15 Commands
As stated in Chapter 4 (4.7.1.2.1), for all verbs apart from the verb of
motion, which has its own special imperative form, the imperative is
formally identical with the 2nd person (singular or plural) of the Aorist572GEORGIANGRAMMARIndicative. 1st person exhortations and 3rd person jussives are expressed
by means of the (Prešent or Aorist) Subjunctive in the appropriate person.
For those verbs which have no Aorist Indicative, commands are expressed
by use of the Prešent Subjunctive in the 2nd person, e.g.
torem, (Ø-Ø-)i-c-od-e,
cocxal-i
ver
otherwise (you-it-)SV-know-IMPERF-SuBJ(PRES) alive-NOM not(POT)
c'a-m-i-x-val! 7
PREV-me-OV-you-go(FuT)
'Otherwise, know that you shall not get away from me alive!'
In the šense of 'only just VERB' the particle ogond (with variants
ogond k'i, ogonda-c) is used with the Imperative (see next section for its
use in wishes), e.g.
ogond ga-mo-(Ø-)di
mand-e+dan,
just
PREV-PREV-(you-)come.out(I MPER) there-from
q'vela+per-i
rig-ze
i-kn-eb-a
everything-NOM order-on
PASS-be-TS-it(FuT)da
and'Only just come out of there, and everything will be in order'
5.1.16 Wishes
The subjunctive (Prešent, Aorist, or sometimes, as an alternative to the
latter, the Future) is used, depending on aspect, sometimes accompanied by
the particles dae and net'av 'would that' (cf. 3.6.7); the old, generally
defunct optative particle -mc(a), which originally accompanied an
indicative verb, is also sometimes found with such subjunctives (cf. 3.6.14).
The IIIrd Subjunctive also occurs in wishes, particularly on formal
occasions, such as in toasts, e.g.
q'vel+gan m+sopl+i+o-ši
everywhere world-inda-mq'ar-eb-ul-i-q'-o-s
PREV-become.firm-TS-P.PTC-SV-beAOR.SuBJ-it(IIIrd.SUBJ)mšvid+oba!

where the Aorist Subjunctive da-mq'ar-d-e-s is also possible. The IIIrd

wishing, e.g.","[589, 590, 591]"

707PREFACEThis work began with the aim, consistent with the general goal of the
Benjamin-SOAS series of which it is a part, of presenting the essential
structural characteristics of Georgian for the benefit of general linguists.
As it progressed, however, it turned into something more than this. It had
been my aim to write a reference grammar of Georgian after a further ten
years or so of study, but the request from the Series' editors, Professor
Thea Bynon and Professor Matt Shibatani, to contribute a description of
Georgian happened to coincide with an unforeseen rift in my relations with
Georgia which is unlikely to be repaired. And so, rather than continue to
study this language, to which I was introduced seriously in 1975 when I
travelled to Tbilisi as a Cambridge post-graduate student for a year of
intensive learning on a British Council exchange, as, now of necessity for
me, a virtual dead language, I decided that it was time to kill three birds
with one stone. In marshalling here the sum total of the knowledge that I
have acquired over the last twenty years I hope (a) to have satisfied the
faith placed in my ability by Professors Bynon and Shibatani to write a
grammar of use for the general linguist, (b) to have produced a worthwhile
reference-grammar (the first in English) that it had always been my desire
to compose, and (c) to end thereby the period when Georgian has
represented the main focus of my study and research. If I succeed in
easing even a few people's passage through the waiting mysteries, I shall
conclude the last 20 years to have been well spent.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY3394.7.3 Medial Verb Class (sa+ču+aH gvar-is zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
These are a group of verbs which in origin existed only in the Prešent SubSeries; the group includes a whole range of verbs depicting movement, light
and noise (the so-called 'expressives'), as well as weather-terms. The
majority of such verbs are never construed with a direct object, and
indeed in the case of weather-terms like c'vim-s 'it is raining' it may at
first glance seem problematic to identify the referent of even the
obligatory Set A agreement-affix (here -s), though an example such as the
following (with the lexical verb in the Pluperfect and thus manifesting the
typically transitive phenomenon of 'inversion' with its Dative subject) shews
that ca 'sky' can be easily supplied, viz.
gana ca-s
a+m+den-i
u+nd+a (Ø-)e-c'vim-a?
really sky-DAT so.much-NOM should
(it-)IOV-rain-it(PlUP)
'is it really the case that the sky should have rained so much as this?'
Some members of the class may appear with a direct object (e.g.
(Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are playing' vs čog+burt-s (Ø-Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are
playing tennis'). However, in ModernGEORGIANthese verbs have acquired
a full set of screeves across the three Series by virtue of borrowing from
variant-forms of their root, specifically, in the words of Shanidze
(1973.§418), they 'turn to the subjective versional form of the active voice
of their very own root in order to fill in their missing forms: cxovrobs,
cxovrobda, cxovrobdes [Prešent and Imperfect Indicatives plus Prešent
Subjunctive of the verb 'live'—BGHÎ but i-cxovrebs, i-cxovra [Future and
Aorist Indicatives of the same verb—BGH]. Today we understand these as
forms of one and the same verb ... but in origin they were different verbs:
i-cxovrebs is the subjective version which has as its neutral version aCXOVrebS ['X makes Y live'—BGH1. But this form of the subjective version isdrained of any versional content by virtue of the fact that it has been
deprived of its direct object and, as a verb that has been left objectless,
has become intransitive. Despite this, it has retained two markers of a
transitive verb, the one syntactic, the other morphological: (a) with IInd
Series forms it takes its subject in the Narrative case ..., (b) forms of the
III rd Series are produced through inversion and, linked to this, its subject
stands in the Dative ... The verb acxovra has both subject and direct
object: k'ot'em k'argad acxovra col-švili ['K'ot'e gave wife and child a good
life'—BGH]. By the way, as direct object the reflexive pronoun tavi is also
possible with it [tavs saca unda vacxovreb ['I shall settle myself down
wherever it proves necessary'—BGH] (Vazha Pshavela, V,6,ll). But what34ØGEORGI AN GRAMMARon earth is the direct object with the subjective versional icxovra man?
['What' did it 'make live'?—seemingly tavi ['itself'—BGH], which was lostt
since it was the one and only [possible object—BGH] and thus easily
understood. Because of the loss of its object the verb lost its transitivity
and thus came to match the Medial and took upon itself the function of
filling the Medial's missing forms. Only its syntactic force in the IInd and
IIIrd Series and the morphological indicator in the III rd Series (inversion)
remind us of its active [sc. voice—BGH] formation'.
This lengthy quote introduces a number of important features that are
characteristic of the Medial Verbs: the Future Indicative (sc. of Medišis
which have no indirect object associated with them; such 'relative' Medišis
will be discussed separately below) is produced by resorting to the
formant-combination i-...-eb, which is taken by Holisky (1981.1)80 as the
defining phenomenon of the Class81, so that the Future Indicatives 'it will
rain' and 'you will play (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s and (šog+burt-s)
(Ø-Ø-)i-tamaš-eb; in origin these are active voiced Transitive Verbforms in Subjective Version with an understood reflexive tav-i 'head; self'
as direct object 82 , and as such the Conditional and Future Subjunctive are
formed as would one anticipate for any Transitive Verb with Thematic
Suffix -eb; Series 11 and 111 are then formed from such Transitive Verbforms (almost!) as one would expect, viz. being characterised by, with one
exception, a Weak Aorist Indicative and in all cases an Aorist Subjunctive
in -o, coupled with Ergative subject throughout Series II, and by Inversion
coupled with Dative subject (and, where applicable, Nominative direct
object) in Series III, so that the Aorist Indicatives 'it rained' and 'you
played (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-a and (čog+burt-i) (Ø-Ø-)i-tamaa-e,
whilst the Perfects are (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a and (čog+burt-i) g-i-tamaš(n-)i-a; though not stated explicitly, it is clear from the quoted forms that
the Medials do not employ preverbs in the perfective screeves, a fact
which is ascribed by Holisky to their esšentially atelic aspect, which is
incompatible with the basically perfectivising function of the preverbs. I
part company with Shanidze only insofar as he assumes that, once these
forms have been borrowed, they take on the intransitivity of the verbforms to which they act as paradigm-fillers. Writing a traditional grammar
in an age when it would have been highly unusual to operate with more
than a single level of description (for his Fundamentals of the Grammar of
theGEORGIANlanguage first appeared as such in 1953 and even then was
based on a number of revisions dating back to a slimmer 214-page volume
of 193Ø), it was not open to Shanidze to posit the prešence underlyingly of
the original direct object tav-i that he clearly regarded as the motivation
for the Subjective Version in the screeves of the Future Sub-Series and ofVERBAl MORPHOlOGY341Series II (as well as, of course, for the prešence of Inversion in Series III).
We are not today so restricted, and, as I have argued in a number of
places (1983, 1987a, 1989, 1995), it is by taking for granted the esšential
(underlying) transitivity of Medial Verb-forms outside the Prešent SubSeries that one arrives at the most convincing account of the morphosyntax of Medišis and related phenomena. Where we have such forms as
(?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' or (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a 'it apparently rained',
I place a question-mark before the 3rd person morph to shew that there is
no argument external to the verb correlating with it, even though
according to the analysis just advanced I assume that the relevant
argument is prešent underlyingly but obligatorily deleted once the verb's
transitivity has been established and the agreement-markers have been
assigned accordingly.
In addition to not taking preverbs where one would otherwise have
expected them to occur, the other morphological oddity of Medišis resides
in the fact that, even though almost all of them behave like Transitive
Verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb in the Future Sub-Series and Series II, no
Thematic Suffix appears in the Perfect (or in either of the other two
screeves of Series III), but a strange element -n- may optionally be used 83
immediately after the root in all three Series III screeves for those
Medišis whose root-structure does not make the addition of such a nasal
difficult to pronounce. We have already met such a formant, as with the
Transitive root -t'ac-, where the Perfect may be formed normally or with
the aid of this nasal, e.g.
okro-s
kurd-s
ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-eb
gold-DAT thief-DAT PREV-PREV-(you-it-)him-snatch-TS(FUT)
xel-i+dan
hand-from
'you will snatch the gold from the hand of the thief'
=> Aorist okro kurd-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-e xel-i+dan => Perfect
okro kurd-is-tvis
ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-n-i-a/ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-eb-i-a
xel-i+dan. I have suggested elsewhere (1987b) that this nasal may be the
remnant of an earlier formant -in-, just as in Mingrelian one finds exactly
this sequence sometimes turning up in Series 111 of Medials (e.g. Aorist tik (?Ø-)i-ngar-u =GEORGIANman (?Ø-)i-t'ir-a 'X cried' vs Perfect
ti-s
(Ø-)u-ngar-(in-)?u
=GEORGIANm a - s
(Ø-)u-t'ir-(n-)i-?a
'X
apparently cried'), which I related to the Causative formant, arguing that
the Causative may have been employed to reinforce the Transitive status
of the verb-forms in question, just as today one can point to a number of342GEORGI AN GRAMMARcases where the morphological Causative (see 4.8) does not differ in
meaning from the corresponding non-Causative but Transitive form (e.g.
(Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en = (Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to run').
The reason why the Thematic Suffix -eb- itself cannot be used is that its
prešence would entirely alter the meaning. The reason for this is as
follows: outside the Prešent Sub-Series, as we have stated, Medišis borrow
the Subjective Version variant of a form of their root which otherwise is
produced by means of the a-versioniser in combination with the Thematic
Suffix -eb. We, thus, have such pairs as: (Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' vs (Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to speak'. The
former has the Perfect g - i - l a p ' a r a k ' - ( n - ) i - ? a vs Pluperfect g - e lap'arak'-(n-)?a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-(n-)o-?s, whereas
the latter has the Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-eb-i-a vs Pluperfect g - e lap'arak'-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-eb-in-o-s. And
so, we see that with the Thematic Suffix -eb prešent the verb-form
actually has the meaning of the (pseudo-)Causative from which the Medial
(outside the Prešent Sub-Series) is itself derived.
The one Medial which does not have the Weak conjugation in its Aorist
Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel/perceive X/them'. Additionally, this
Medial is one of the exceptions in terms of its Future Sub-Series formation,
for its Future Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-ob. Its Series II screeves
conjugate thus:
Aorist Indicative
v-[Ø-)i-grjen-i
(Ø-Ø-)i-grjen-i
(Ø-)i-grjn-o
v-(Ø-)i-grjen-i-t
(Ø-Ø-)i-grjen-i-t
(Ø-)i-grjn-esAorist Subjunctive
v-(Ø-)i-grjn-o
(Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-o
(Ø-)i-grjn-o-s
v-(Ø-)i-grjn-o-t
(Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-o-t
(Ø-)i-grjn-o-nSeries III is then: Perfect g-i-grjvn-i-a (N.B. the root-expansion),
Pluperfect g-e-grjn-o, III rd Subjunctive g-e-grjn-o-s. Medišis only
ever occur with a 3rd person direct object, and since all Medišis apart
from 'feel' have a Weak Aorist Indicative conjugation ending in -a for a
3rd person singular subject, and since the Pluperfect is formally akin to the
Aorist Indicative, all Medišis apart from 'feel' have Pluperfect ending in -a
(and, of course, III rd Subjunctive in -o-s). To illustrate the full Series II
and 111 paradigms of a 'regular' Medial let us take the verb for 'play (X)':VERBAl MORPHOlOGYAorist Indicative

(Ø-)e-tamaš-(n-)o-tIn the Prešent Sub-Series Medials manifest a number of different
Thematic Suffixes. Given the Prešent Indicative, the Imperfect Indicative
and Prešent Subjunctive are formed as one would expect, except that
where the Prešent Indicative appears to shew the Thematic Suffix -i (as in
(Ø-)t'ir-i 'you cry'), the Imperfect Indicative and Prešent Subjunctive
incorporate -od- and not -d- alone (e.g. (Ø-)t'ir-od-i 'you were crying',
(Ø-)t'ir-od-e 'may you be crying'); indeed, in the Prešent Indicative some
speakers add the Prešent Indicative of the copula when a Medial in -i has
a 1st or 2nd person subject, so that 'cry' conjugates thus:
Present Indicative
v-t'ir-i(-v-a+r)
(Ø-)t'ir-i(-x-a+r)
t'ir-i-s
v-t'ir-i(-v-a+r)-t

(Ø-)t'ir-od-e
t'ir-od-e-s
v-t'ir-od-e-t
(Ø-)t'ir-od-e-t
t'ir-od-nenThe Future Indicative is (Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-e =>
Perfect g-i-t f ir-(n-)i-a => Pluperfect g-e-t'ir-(n-)a. With direct object,
this root usually means 'mourn = weep for' (e.g. tkven g-t'ir-od-nen 'they
were mourning/weeping for you(Pl.)'), though in the following example we
seem to have more of an internal object (viz. čven-s sa+t'ir+al-s
kart+ul-ad v-(Ø-)t'ir-i-t 'we cry our weeping-ceremony 84 inGEORGIAN');
sometimes the verb is written with an agreement-prefix s- in such cases344GEORGI AN GRAMMAR(e.g. s-t'ir-i-an k'onpederaci-is da+šl+a-s 'they mourn/weep over the
break-up of the confederation'). The pattern of agreement incorporating
1st and 2nd person of the copula as suffix is, however, obligatory in the
Prešent Indicative for the root -c'ux- 'be unhappy, upset' (Future = (Ø?Ø-)i-c'ux-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-c'ux-eb => Perfect g-i-c'ux-(n-)i-?a),

A handful of Medišis have a prefixal passive form in the Prešent SubSeries only (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)varaud-ob 'you suppose X/them' => i-varaud-eba 'it is/may be supposed'86; (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel X/them' => i-grjnob-a 'X is/may be perceived' 87 ; (Ø-Ø-)gul+is+xm-ob 'you mean X/them'
=> i-gul+is+xm-eb-a 'it is meant' 88 ).
In the case of (Ø-)galob 'you hymn, sing' the ob-element is evidently
part of the root, giving Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-galob-eb, Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)igalob-e, Perfect g-i-galob-(n-)i-?a.","[357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364]"
"192GEORGI AN GRAMMAR4.4.6 Interplay of Versions and the Marking of Arguments
Performing actions such as the following to parts of the subject's own body
naturally motivates the appearance of the Subjective Version: p'ir-s da(Ø-Ø-)i-ban 'you will wash your face', tma-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'reč' 'you will
cut your hear', cxvir-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xoc-av 'you will wipe your nose'. It
might be thought that performing these actions for another person would
result in a switch to the Objective Version, whereas in fact the indirect
object is indicated without recourse to any of the versionisers, as may be
seen in: p'ir-s da-(Ø-Ø-)m-ban 'you will wash my face', tma-s mo(Ø-)g-k'reč' 'I will cut your hear', deda cxvir-eb-s mo-(Ø-)gv-xocav-s 'mother will wipe our noses'. The same interplay is seen in the case
of taking off one's own vs another's item of clothing, viz. p'alt'o-s ga-(00-)i-xd-i 'you will take off your coat' vs p'alt'o-s ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-xd-i 'you
will remove my coat'; c'ind-eb-s ga-v-(Ø-)i-xd-i 'I shall take off my
socks/stockings' vs c'ind-eb-s bavšv-s ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)-xd-i 'I shall
remove the child's socks/stockings'; mama kud-s mo-(Ø-)i-xd-i-s 'father
will take off his hat' vs mama šv+il-s kud-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)-xd-i-s 'father
will remove the hat from his child's head'.
When it comes to putting clothing on, the Subjective Version alternates
with the locative (e.g. maisur-s ča-(Ø-Ø-)i-cv-am 'you will put on your
vest' vs maisur-s bavàv-s ča-(0-0-0-)a-cv-am 'you will put the vest
on the baby', mc'q'ems-i nabad-s mo-(Ø-)i-sx-am-s 'the shepherd will
don his felt-cloak' vs mc'q'ems-i st'umar-s nabad-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-sxam-s 'the shepherd will put his felt-cloak on the guest', kud-s da-v(Ø-)i-xur-av 'I shall put on my hat' vs inglis+el-s svan+ur kud-s dav-(Ø-Ø-)a-xur-av 'I shall put a Svan hat on the Englishman's head'—note
the three roots for putting on clothing depend on whether the item involves
a part of the body being inserted into it vs whether the item folds around
the body vs whether the items rests on the head. For the Future SubSeries and Series II of the root -sc'avl- the versional opposition just
illustrated causes a shift in meaning (viz. ucxo+el-i kart+ul-s (Ø-)is c ' a v l - i - s 'the foreigner will learnGEORGIAN'vs šukia ucxo+el-s
kart+ul-s (Ø-Ø-)a-sc'avl-i-s 'Shukia is teaching/will teach the
foreignerGEORGIAN').Cf.

'I '11 lend my friend the money'
vs pul-s v-(Ø-)i-sesx-eb Tll borrow the money'.
The Objective Version appears in the verb for the expression 'apologise
to X', viz.
šina+ber+a-s bodiš-s
mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-xd-i-an
spinster-DAT
apology-DAT
PREV-(it-her-)OV-pay-TS(FUT)-they
'they will apologise to the spinster'
whereas, if no recipient of the apology is indicated, the verb contains the
Subjective Version (viz. bodiš-s mo-(Ø-)i-xd-i-an 'they will apologise').

with an alternative root for 'charge' it is the locative Version that is used,

Subjective Versional (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-gira+v-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'indeb mean 'you (will) take X/them as surety' (though tav-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-)igira+v-eb means 'you (will) mortgage all you have'), whereas Objective
Versional (da-)(0-0-0-)u-gira+v-eb = (da-)(0-0-0-)u-c'ind(r)-eb
mean 'you (will) give X/them to Y/them as surety', for which a Neutral
Versional variant with postposition -tan would be the following: ma-s-tan
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-gira+v-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c'ind(r)-eb 30
A similar
opposition between - t a n with Neutral Version vs Objective Version is
illustrated by:

Clark-Kerr'
At least three roots (namely -g- 'understand', -jer- 'believe', and - s m 'listen to') exemplify an interesting alternation between Subjective and
Objective Versions whereby the former is used in the prešence of only the
direct object reprešenting what is listened to/understood/believed, whereas
the latter is required in the prešence of the indirect object reprešenting
the person listened to/understood/believed regardless of whether the
direct object slot is externally filled or not, e.g.

vs vi-s gada-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-g-eb (surat-s)? 'whom will you photograph?'.
With other roots the use of the Subjective Version when the verb has
no indirect object contrasts with the abšence of any versioniser in the
prešence of an indirect object. Examples: p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)i-txov 'you will
ask for bread' vs mezobel-s p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)s-txov 'you will ask the
neighbour for bread', p'olici+el-eb-ma
mo-(?Ø-)i-xed-es 'the
policemen looked in this direction' vs p'olici+el-eb-ma hulign-eb-s
m o - ( ? Ø - ) g v - x e d - e s 'the policemen looked (in this direction) at us
hooligans', (Ø-Ø-)i-k'itx-e xalx-ši 'you enquired (sc. about something)
among the people' vs xalx-s (Ø-Ø-)h-k'itx-e 'you asked the people (sc.
about something)'. With the final opposition from the previous paragraph
compare the somewhat archaic expression seen in:196GEORGIANGRAMMAR
i+m-is
tav+xed+oba-s
that-GEN arrogance-DATšen
ar
you(DAT) notmo-(Ø-)g-k'itx-av
PREV-(it-)you-seek.
answer-TS(FUT)
'I shall not ask you to answer for that person's arrogance'
Note also what happens with the root -q'id- in the Future Sub-Series
and Series II: Subjective Versional saxl-s v-(Ø-)i-q'id-i 'I'll buy a/the
house' vs saxl-s mo-(Ø-)g-q'id-i 'I'll sell the house to you' or saxl-s
mi-(Ø-Ø-)h-q'id-i kal-s 'you will sell the house to the woman' (vs the
Neutral Versional saxl-s ga-v-(Ø-)q'id-i 'I'll sell the house').
Since the Subjective Version does not always appear when one would
logically expect it, it is perhaps hardly surprising that one can adduce
examples where the locative Version wins out when either the Subjective
or the locative Version could logically be employed, e.g.
kal-ma

No Subjective Version is possible when the root requires the indirect
object to be marked without versioniser, e.g.

tav+is mam+ul-s

'the hero sacrificed his own life to his own country'
In a colloquial expression for 'gathering X together', the direct object
tav-i does not belong to the verb's subject and so would never motivate
the Subjective Version, e.g.

Note the prešence of the preverb m o - in these examples, which
replaces each root's normal preverb to emphasise the fact that the action
does not apply to the whole of the indirect object. This is seen clearly in
the KEGl definition for mo-(Ø-)s-c'v-av-s, which is:

is linked to less concrete cases of 'placement', e.g.

It is also possible to point to an interplay between Objective Version
and lack of versioniser with some intransitive verb-forms. An indirect
object can be associated with the basic verb of motion. I n the Future SubSeries and in Series 11 this indirect object has to be indicated by the201VERBAl MORPHOlOGYObjective Version—for mo-svl-a 'coming' this gives examples like ra mog-i-va-t? 'what will come over you(Pl)?', ra mo-gv-i-vid-od-a? 'what
would come/would have come over us?', ra mo-(Ø-)u-vid-a-t? 'what
came over them?', etc... In the Prešent Sub-Series the lack of versioniser
seems more common, for this coupling of preverb and root at any rate (e.g.
ra mo-s-di-t? 'what comes over them?'). This verb-form can also mean
with either marking of the indirect object 'receive, gain, acquire', though in
the expression 'liquid flows from' (as in:
t'an-i+dan sisxl-i
mo-s-di-od-a
body-from
blood-NOM PREV-X-flow-I MPERF-it
'blood was flowing from X's body')
it seems from KEGl's illustrations that the Objective Version is not used.
For the motion-root in association with other preverbs it will sometimes be
the case that in the Prešent Sub-Series some šense(s) may be conveyed by
either marking of the indirect object, whereas others may be particular to
one method or the other, e.g.

However, if we take the example: cxen-s pex-i mo-s-t'q'd-a 'the
horse got its leg broken', we cannot convert this verb-form into one where
Objective Version - u - substitutes for the - s - and end up with a
synonymous expression, for such a substitution would imply a structure of
the form:
cxen-s
pex-i
mo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-t'q'd-a
h o r š D A T leg-NOM PREV-(?it-3rd.PER-)OV-break-it
'X's horse got its leg broken'ma-s
X-DATThe 'horse' remains the indirect object possessing the broken leg (and
presumably marked by the first notional zero-morph), whilst the horse's
owner is added as second indirect object, dependent upon the Objective
Version vowel. Similar analyses are called for in the case of some of those
remarkable 'Intransitive' Verbs which yet can be associated with two
arguments, e.g.

4.4.7 indirect Object Version iser
This version-vowel, if indeed it can be properly so called, basically serves
as substitute for the most widespread passive/intransitive-marker for
screeves in Series I and II, namely i-, when an indirect object is
associated with such a passive/intransitive verb. I f we take the verb-form
(i+s) i-c'er-eb-a as a monovalent passive 'X is being written', a Dative
indirect object can be associated with this verb-form simply by placing the
relevant (pro)noun in the Dative and switching the initial vowel, thus:
(ma-s) (Ø-)e-c'er-eb-a. Out of context this verb-phrase can mean: 1.
'X is being written for Y', which correlates with the active voice in
Objective Version ((vin+me vin+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-Ø-)u-c'er-s
'someone writes something for someone'); 2. 'X is being written on Y', which
correlates with the active voice in locative Version ((vin+me vin+mes/ra+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-c'er-s 'someone writes something on
someone/something'), 3. 'X is being written to Y', which correlates with the
active voice marking its indirect object without versioniser ((vin+me
vin+me-s ra+me-s) (Ø-)s-c'er-s 'someone writes something to
someone'). In other words, a passive/intransitive in e- can have as many
meanings as the equivalent active voice can have different types of
semantic nuances for its range of differently marked indirect objects.
Where a range of preverbs characterises the active voice, the same range
will apply to the passive, and, since the active voice verb-forms quoted
above do not employ just one preverb outside the Prešent Sub-Series, the
same distinctions will be made for the bivalent passive, giving the following
Prešent-Future, active-passive correlations:205VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

with the immediately preceding one:

'who's this darned person that's fastened onto me?'
Just as the postposition -ze often reinforces (and thereby strictly
renders superfluous) the Locative Version for active voice verbs, so the
Dative nominal with these bipersonal Intransitives sometimes gives way to
a postpositional phrase (thereby rendering them monovalent), as in:2Ø6GEORGIANGRAMMARsp'ilo

body-INST
'the elephant flopped to the ground with its whole body'
vs pr+in+v+el-i mic'a-ze ga-(?Ø-)e-rtx-a 'the bird flopped down on
the ground'. With a number of such verbs clear preference is given to the
postpositional variant, e.g.
me+om+ar-i brj+ol+a-ši
ča-(?Ø-)e-b-a
warrior-NOM fight-in
PREV-(?it-)IOV-get.stuck.into-he(AOR)
'the warrior got stuck into the battle'
On other occasions such verbs may be used with an indirect object or
simply without one, as appropriate, e.g.
mo-(Ø-)m-e-šv-i
PREV-(you-)me-IOV-leave.alone-AOR.INDIC(=I MPER)

Often such verb-forms, whether construed with a second external
nominal (albeit postpositional) or not, seem to have an air of a reflexive

the usual ga-(mo-), such that the derivation of the šense may be: 'be šent

The e-versioniser may mark the 'logical' subject for certain so-called
'Indirect Verbs' (such as with the root - s m - 'hear, understand, detect a
smell':VERBAl MORPHOlOGY

sound(NOM)m-e-sm-i-s i+s sun-i 'I smell that smell', m-e-sm-i-s i+s, ra-sa-c
(Ø-Ø-) amb-ob 'I understand that which you say'). Indeed, this is the
normal way of expressing such 'logical' subjects in Future Sub-Series
screeves, e.g.

money-NOM I -IOV-have-TS(FUT)-it
'I shall have the money tomorrow'xval
tomorrowIndirect Verbs have no Series II, unless one counts the somewhat
anomalous (Ø-)e-q'+ol-a, which, as stated by KEGl, is sometimes used for
the Future (Ø-)e-q'+ol-eb-a 'X will have animate Y/them'. Similarly the
e-versioniser is employed automatically in the Future Sub-Series and in
Series 11 for Stative Verbs, whether or not there exists an external
argument in the Dative, e.g.
c'er+il-i

For ( š ) g - e - b r a l - e b - a 'you (will) pity X/them' there is a synonym
(š)g-bral-d-eb-a.
Two special sub-types of Indirect Verbs which have their logical
subject indicated by the e-versioniser are: (a) those that express a desire
on the part of the logical subject. Such verbs only exist in the Prešent
Sub-Series, and there is no external referent for their obligatory Set A
agreement-affix (e.g. gogo-s (Ø-)e-mger-eb-a 'the girl has a hankering
to sing', gogo-s (Ø-)e-t'ir-eb-a 'the girl has a hankering to cry', gogo-s

andSimilar formations often indicate that the action occurs without the
intention of the Dative nominal concerned; these formations are not limited
to the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. ga-m-e-cin-a 'I burst out laughing', gagv-e-gim-eb-a 'we shall break out in smiles'). (b) Indirect Verbs with the
e-versioniser and with additional Series 11 forms (but minus any preverb)
can be formed from adjectives to express the idea 'X judges Y/them to be
ADJECTIVE' (e.g. advil-i 'easy' => g-e-advil-eb-a/g-e-advil-a 'you
deem/deemed X/them to be easy', u+xerx+ul-i 'embarrassing' => g-eu + xerx + u l - e b - a / g - e - u + xerx + ul-a 'you deem/deemed X/them

the syntactic configuration in Series 11 is different, the former verb-form
taking a Nominative subject and Dative object, the latter an Ergative
subject and Nominative object).
For the role of the e-versioniser as obligatory component in the
marking of the verb's Dative subject in the Pluperfect and 111 rd
Subjunctive of Transitive and Medial Verbs see 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3. Apart
from the e-versioniser's role as part-marker of subjects for Transitive and
Medial Verbs in the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive, it is surprisingly
found with two related roots in their transitive Series I and 11 screeves,
and this despite the fact that their second argument is a direct rather than
indirect object (viz. (Ø-Ø-)e-j+eb 'you (will) seek X/them': (Ø-Ø-)e-j+

(k'ac-t(a))As regards the actual shape of the modern case-markers, little needs to
be said other than that four of them clearly exist in two forms, possessing
both short and long variants. In essence the long form is a positionally
determined variant of the short form, required, for example, in sequences
before monosyllables such as da 'and', e.g.
k'ac-sa da kal-s
man-DAT and woman-DAT
'to the man and the woman'
tbilis-isa
da kutais-is

pipe-INST and cigarette-INST
'with/by pipe and cigarette'
briq'v-ada da maimun-ad
idiot-ADV
and monkey-ADV
'as an idiot and monkey'
If, for stylistic reasons, an adnominal Genitive is placed after its headnoun, as was the normal order in Old Georgian, the long form is again
employed (e.g. kutais-is si+lamaz+e vs si+lamaz+e kutais-isa 'the
beauty of Kutaisi')—cf. 5.I.2.
According to the pattern set out above the case-desinences are merely
added to the stem, and this pattern is followed by all consonant-stem nouns
with two exceptions: (i) the Vocative of proper-names is simply the bare
stem itself (e.g. zurab! 'Zurab!', elizabed! 'Elizabeth!'); (ii) some nouns
(including some vowel-stems—see 2.2.4.2) undergo vowel-syncope within the
root. Syncope primarily applies to the vowels -a- and -e- in the Genitive,
Instrumental and Adverbial cases of the singular plus all the cases in the
modern plural. The examples are of gutan-i 'plough' and c'el-i 'year':35NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY

(c'el-t(a))Whilst one can state certain tendencies regarding the likelihood of
syncope operating, hard and fast rules are elusive—for example, tval-i
'eye' does not syncopate (= Genitive tval-is(a)), whereas for the meaning
'precious stone' it does syncopate (= Genitive tvl-is(a)). One can do no
better than quote Vogt (1971:2Iff.), who gives the following observations
(abbreviated here): The phonemic structure of the stem does not permit
one to see whether the stem is stable or syncopating. The stem of kal-i
'woman' is stable, that of bal-i 'cherry' syncopating. Some stable stems
become syncopating as second term of a compound. The stem of kal-i
remains stable (e.g. sepe+kal-i 'princess', Genitive sepe+kal-is(a)), but
the stem of k'ar-i 'door', which is stable (Genitive k'ar-is(a)), undergoes
vocalic alterations in compounds (e.g. c+is+k'ar-i 'dawn', Genitive
c+is+k'r-isia))... In certain instances one may suppose that the absence
of syncope is due to phonemic [phonotactic?—BGH] factors... m-k'vd-ar-i
'dead person' has the Genitive m-k'vd-r-is(a), but... m-tvr-a1-i 'drunk
person' has the Genitive m-tvr-al-is(a). The form *m-tvr-l-is(a) would
be tolerable only with difficulty in the system...
'Alternance a / 0 . In monosyllabic stems vocalic syncope is exceptional
if the beginning of the stem is a simple consonant... Monosyllables which in
anlaut have a consonantal group are in general syncopated, unless
factors of phonemic structure are against it... We thus have... mt'k'var-i36GEORGI AN GRAMMAR'(Tbilisi's river) Kura' [Genitive mt'k'vr-isia)]... As exceptions one can
mention... k'val-i 'track, trace' [Genitive k'val-is(a)], svan-i 'Svan person'
[Genitive svan-is(a)]... In polysyllabic stems (Georgian or of foreign
origin, especially Arabo-Persian), even in recent borrowings from IndoEuropean languages, syncope is the rule if the final consonant of the stem
is a sonant. With final -an we have for example ak'van-i 'cradle'
(Genitive ak'vn-is(a)), bat'k'an-i 'lamb' (Genitive bat'k'n-is(a))... With
final -am for example at'am-i 'peach' (Genitive at'm-is(a))..., katam-i
'chicken' [Genitive katm-is(a)]. With final -al for example dedal-i
'female (of animal)' (Genitive dedl-is(a))... With final ~ar for example
bazar-i 'market' (Genitive bazr-is(a))... With final -av for example
k'arav-i 'tent' (Genitive k'arv-is(a))... In participle[-derived] stems in -av
the stem is generally stable (e.g. sa-nax-av-i 'something to be seen',
Genitive sa-nax-av-is(a), u-nax-av-i 'something unseen', Genitive u nax-av-is(a)). Stems whose final consonant is other than a sonant are
generally stable, but syncope is probably the rule in araq'-i 'vodka'
[Genitive arq'-is(a)], nabad-i 'shepherd's felt-cloak' [Genitive n a b d is(a)]...
'Alternance e / 0 . The conditions of syncope are in the main the same
as in the preceding instances. Monosyllabic words with consonant-initial
do not syncopate... with the exception of c'el-i 'year', Genitive c'l-is(a).
Words with initial consonantal group may have syncope (e.g. mgel-i 'wolf',
Genitive mgl-is(a), equally... mgvdel-i 'priest' [Genitive mgvdl-is(a)],...
c'ven-i 'juice' [Genitive c'vn-is(a)]), but without syncope [are] gvel-i
'snake' [Genitive gvel-is(a)], mc'er-i 'insect' [Genitive mc'er-is(a)],
sxven-i 'attic' [Genitive sxven-is(a)].... The words ber-i 'monk' and peri 'colour' are with stable stem according to rule, but syncope is the rule in
the derivative beber-i 'old woman' [Genitive bebr-is(a)]... and in the
numerous compounds like... q'vela+per-i 'everything' [Genitive q'vela+pris(a)].
'In polysyllabic stems with sonant final syncope is the rule with
restrictions of a phonemic order signalled (e.g... ševarden-i 'falcon'
[Genitive ševardn-is(a)], mzitev-i 'dowry' [Genitive mzitv-is(a)]. The
numerous participial derivatives in m(a)- -el-i, sa—el-i, and u- -el-i
in general have syncope, but syncope does not take place if the suffix is
preceded by the sonant -v- (final of the present stem). Family-names with
-el-i in general are syncopated (e.g.. c'eretel-i [Genitive c'eretl-is(a)]),
but for nouns designating origin there is much fluctuation. One has imerel-i'Imeretian (person), Genitive imer-l-is(a), beside k'ax-el-i 'Kaxetian
(person)', Genitive k'ax-el-isia), kart+v-el-i 'Georgian (person)',
Genitive kart+v-el-is(a). Nouns introduced more recently are in general37NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYwithout syncope (e.g... inglis-el-i 'English (person)', Genitive inglis-elis(a)). With final consonant other than a sonant syncope is met only in the
words beč'ed-i 'ring' [Genitive beč'd-is(a)], somex-i 'Armenian (person)'
[Genitive somx-is(a)].'
In addition there are the straightforward irregularities like ambav-i
'news, report', which has Genitive amb-is(a) (cf. Nominative plural ambeb-i), and gmert-i 'god', which has Genitive gvt-is(a), although the
regular gmert-is(a) is also found.
The vowel -o- in polysyllabic stems is also susceptible to syncope,
though this vowel does not disappear altogether, unless it follows a labial
consonant or the preceding syllable contains the vowel -o-, but rather
reduces to -v-. The first illustration is of the noun mac'on-i 'yoghurt':

(zġva-t(a))The stem's final a-vowel drops in those same instances where syncope
occurs with some consonant-final stems (viz. throughout the modern plural
and in the Genitive, Instrumental and Adverbial singular, though in this last
case one could, of course, choose to segment as follows: zġva-d(a)). The
Vocative singular for such monosyllabic words as the one presented could
retain the full syllabic desinence, though for polysyllabic a-stems this
would reduce to -v (e.g. deda-v 'mother!'). The Ergative normally ends in
just -m, the long form occurring before, for example, monosyllabic da 'and'
or the clitic -c 'also'.
Proper names ending in the a-vowel behave slightly differently, e.g.

ADVERBIALSingular
šota
šota
šotas (a)
šota-m(a)
šotas(a)
sota-ti
šota-d(a)This time the pre-consonantal vocalic element of the ending in the last
three cases is missing. The first consequence of this is that the Genitive
now falls together with the Dative (e.g. sota-sa da mariam-is jma
'Shota's and Mariam's brother', or šota-sa da mariam-is(a)-tvis 'for (=
-tvis) Shota and Mariam'). Note that the Instrumental is in -ti. When the
nouns mama 'father' and deda 'mother' are used in references to the
speaker's parents, they function rather like proper names and will decline
a c c o r d i n g l y — c o m p a r e the variants deda-s
na+m+cxv+ar-i
'Mother's/Mum's cake' vs ded-is na+m+cxv+ar-i 'the/a mother's cake'.
Some common nouns in -a also follow this paradigm, though in the
plural this -a disappears (e.g. c+i+sa+rt'q'+el+a 'rainbow', which has
respectively Genitive, Instrumental and Nominative plural c+i+sa+rt'q'+39NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYel+a-s(a), c+i+sa+rt'q'+el+a-ti, c+i+sa+rt'q'+el-eb-i; mela 'fox' has
Genitive in mela-s(a) but its variant melia has meli-is(a)). Derivatives
in -a described in 3.9.1 also belong here. Typically Mingrelian surnames in
-ia, -ua, -ava follow this pattern too (e.g. t'ogo gudava-s m+egr+ul-i
gramat'ik'a 'T'ogo Gudava's Mingrelian grammar', gudav-eb-i 'the
Gudavas').
An example of a noun in -a undergoing syncopation of the root-vowel
is kveq'ana 'world, country' whose Genitive, Instrumental, Adverbial
Singular and Nominative Plural are respectively: kveq'n-is(a), kveq'nit(a), kveq'n-ad(a), kveq'n-eb-i.

In the modern plural formation the radical e-ending is retained, as in the
Adverbial singular, though it is lost in the Genitive and Instrumental
singular. The Vocative singular ending of polysyllabic e-stems loses its
syllabic value (e.g. me+rje+v+e-v 'milkman!').
Again proper nouns in -e are slightly different, though Georgian
surnames ending in -je (a noun meaning 'son', earlier 'heir') are treated liket'q'e:

3.1.4 Postposed Adnominal Genitives and Double Declension
In modern Georgian adnominal Genitives almost always precede their heads
and do not alter in any way as the head declines in either the singular or
plural. Old Georgian, however, placed adnominal Genitives after their
heads, and the head's case-ending was repeated in full (except for the
Adverbial) after the Genitive desinence. The following example, based on
Shanidze (1976:44), is for the phrase 'house of timber':

of the older pattern, and Shanidze gives (part of) the following declension,
where xe is 'tree, timber', as a modern equivalent of the same Old
Georgian phrase:43NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYCase

saxl-eb-o x-isa-v
saxl-eb-s x-isa-s
saxl-eb-ma x-isa-m
saxl-eb-ad x-isa-dModern Georgian has no palatal glide, and so the head noun's
Nominative ending cannot be repeated; this also no doubt explains the
absence from the paradigm of such sequences when the head is either
Genitive or Instrumental, for here too the initial i-vowel of the
reduplicated endings should have been reduced to this same glide.
Differently from Old Georgian, when the head is Vocative, Ergative or
Adverbial, the form of the reduplicated case-ending is exactly what is
required for these cases by a-stem nouns. However, in my experience
such postposed adnominal Genitives are really only found today when the
head-noun is either Nominative or Dative. And so, most of the paradigm
just set out is somewhat artificial. However, it provides an analogue for
the creation of Georgian's so-called 'double declension'.
In examples where we find a noun repeated with two (or more) different
adnominal Genitives, as in 'Zurab's father took the book, but Zviad's father
returned it', the word 'father' need not actually appear twice in either
English or Georgian. Whilst English merely drops it (to give 'Zurab's father
took the book, but Zviad's—returned it', where the dash marks the gapped
nominal), Georgian adds the case-marker appropriate to the gapped noun
onto the surviving adnominal Genitive. This example in Georgian would be:
zurab-is

It looks here for all the world as though the final word were simply the
long form of the Genitive of this proper name. But this is not so—
underlyingly it is a sequence of GENITIVE-NOMINATIVE, where the
latter morpheme is realised by a zero morph. All nouns whose Genitive
singular ends in -is(a) will shew -isa in such contexts. But of course not all
nouns have a Genitive singular in -is(a)—some vowel-stems have their
Genitive singular, as detailed above, in -s(a), and all such will in the
context we are describing end in -s-i, where the final -i is nothing other
than the Nominative desinence of the gapped Nominative nominal (e.g. vis-i c'ign-i c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e? šota-s-i/giorgi-s-i/uča-s-i/vano-si / e l e n e - s - i 'Whose book did you take? (Lit. The one of)

3.2.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"
"IntroductionThe very esšence of theGEORGIANlanguage (as well as the source of much
of its difficulty) resides in its verbal system. And it is advisable to spend a
while on an overview of the system before entering into detailed
description.
The following are the morphemes that may occur in aGEORGIANverbform, though not necessarily simultaneously: 1. Preverb(s), 2. Pronominal
Agreement-Prefix, 3. Version-Vowel, 4. Root, 5. Causative suffix(es), 6.
Inceptive/Passive Marker, 7. Thematic Suffix, 8. Perfect/Stative Marker,
9. Imperfect Marker, 10. Mood-Vowel, 11. Pronominal AgreementSuffix(es). The Prešent, Past and Aorist Subjunctive of the copula are
incorporated by some verbs into part of their conjugational paradigms. In
OldGEORGIANa further suffixal morpheme that is no longer attested in the
literary language was an element whose prešence was triggered by some
plural Nominative nouns, e.g.
c'ign-i
da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e
book-NOM
PREV-I -(it-)write-I NDI C(AOR)
'I wrote the/a book'
vs
c'ign-n-i
book-Pl-NOM
I wrote books'1da-v-(Ø-)c'er-en
PREV-I -(3rd.PER-)write-Pl(i NDI C.AOR)which latter today would be: c'ign-eb-i (/c'ign-n-i) da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e.
Detailed information is offered later in the chapter for each of the
above-morphological elements. In the meantime, preverbs can be thought
of as somewhat akin to the adverbial components of English phrasal verbs.
Version-vowels indicate certain types of relationships holding between the
verbal arguments (e.g. between subject and direct or indirect object, or118GEORGI AN GRAMMARbetween direct and indirect objects); traditionally there exist Neutral,
Subjective, Objective and locative Versions. Thematic Suffix is the term I
have chošen to describe the set of morphemes according to which the
formation of the tense-mood-aspect paradigms of the language's Transitive
and Intransitive verbs is sub-divided; other terms that have been used for
these morphemes are Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers.
A few examples of the above-verbal morphemes in concrete and regular
verbal complexes may help to give an idea of their behaviour, even if a full
understanding will only be possible once each individual morpheme has
been described in the appropriate section below—the sub-script number
relates to the morpheme-slot from the list prešented above:

Some more complex examples of the system at work are now prešented.
Verbs agree not only with just the subject, e.g.
v-k'vd-eb-iVERBAl MORPHOlOGY119I-die-TS-INDIC(PRES)
'I am dying'
mo-vid-a
PREV-come-X(AOR)
'X came'
but with both subject and direct object, e.g.
g-xed-av-en
you-see-TS-they(PRES)
'they see you'
and also with subject, direct object and indirect object, e.g.
mo-(0-0-)m-e-c-i-t
PREV-(you-X-)me-I OV-give-I NDIC(AOR)-Pl
'you (Pl) gave X/them to me'
m-i-k'vd-eb-a
me-OV-die-TS-X(PRES)
'X is dying for me/my X is dying'
mo-gv-i-vid-a
PREV-us-OV-come-X(AOR)
'X came upon us/we received X'
A verb associated with four external arguments is rare and pushes the
system to its absolute limits, but such forms manifestly cause no difficulty
to the decoder, e.g.
col-ma me
q'ur+ad+g+eb+a
wife-ERG me(DAT) attention(NOM)mi-(0-?0-)m-a-kc-ev-in-a

PREV-(it-?to.it-)me-lV-tie-TS-CAUS-X(AOR)
alone-DAT
'X couldn't make me all by myself tie a bell to the cat'120GEORGI AN GRAMMARSome verbs that are transitive by virtue of their morphology today lack
an external direct object, no doubt by virtue of loss of the relevant but
predictable noun over time, e.g.
man
mo-(?0-)ps-a
X(ERG)
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)urinate-X(AOR)
'X urinated (sc. urine = šard-i/ps+el-i)'
Some such verbs have a non-subject external argument that is actually
the indirect object, e.g.
deda-m
šv+il-s
mother-ERG child-DAT
'the mother hit the child'(?0-)s-cem-a
(?3rd.PER-)it-hit-she(AOR)what she used to hit him being the understood direct object—cf.
bi<5'-i

zurg-ši tovl-is

lad-NOM sister-DAT back-in
snow-GEN ball-DAT
(Ø-)s-druz-av-s
(it-)her-strike-TS(FUT)-he
'the lad will strike his sister in the back a heavy blow with a snowball'
The verb just illustrated for the meaning 'hit' is in the process of
becoming a regular transitive, such that today one often hears in place of
the prescriptively correct construction given above the non-standard
deda-m šv+il-i (Ø-)(s2 -)cem-a; another Transitive verb with missing
direct object and thus an indirect object as second argument is:
(mi-/mo-)(0-?0-0-)a-gn-eb
(PREV-)(you-?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)lV-locate-TS
'you (will) locate X/them'
and yet the autobiography of Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli contains an example with
the second argument in the Nominative alongside the Aorist Subjunctive,
viz.
ro ve+gar
that no.longer(POT)
tav+is-i
own-AGRmi-(?0-0-)a-gn-o-s
PREV-(?3rd.PER-it-)NV-locate-AOR.SUBJ-itšxam-i
venom-NOMVERBAl MORPHOlOGY121'..that it [the snake] may no longer be able to locate its own venom'
where, since there no longer seems to be an indirect object governed by
the locative Version, I have glossed the - a - as the Neutral Version (see
below 4.4.1). In the case of a third verb of this type, as seen in the
šentence p'rogres-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-g+c'-i-es 'they attained progress',
one hears constructions like p'rogres-i i-q'+o mi+g+c+e+ul-i 'progress
was made', where the underlying/original indirect object has been raised to
become subject of this analytical passive (in other words, it is treated like
a regular direct object). Ivane Imnaishvili (1971.331-335) lists 23 verbs
which in OldGEORGIANwere Transitives with just external subject and
indirect object but which today have been realigned as normal Transitives,
taking external subject and direct object in the modern language3. The
verb 'call to/summon' conforms to the prescriptive construction for 'hit', viz.
šen šen-s
you(ERG) your-AGRda-s
da-(0-?0-0-)u-jax-e!
sister-DAT PREV-(you-?3rd.PER-her-)OV-callINDIC(AOR-IMPER)
'call to/summon your sister!'
If one can think of this verb as being at least notionally tri-valent, then
the following quotation from Dolidze's opera Keto and K'ot'e is a further
example of a quadri-valent verb-form:
da-(Ø-?Ø-?Ø-)m-i-jax-e
PREV-(you-?3rd.PER-?her-)me-OV-call-I NDI C(AOR=I MPER)
barbale-s!
Barbale-DAT
'Summon Barbale for me!'.
The indirect object agreement-affix is sometimes attached immediately
before the root, e.g.
kmar-ma
pul-i
mo-(Ø-)m-c-a
husband-ERG money-NOM PREV-(it-)me-give-he(AOR)
'(my) husband gave me (the) money'
whereas a so-called 'Version'-vowel sometimes intervenes between the two,
for example with locative Version:
kmar-i
pul-s
(Ø-)m-a-jl-ev-s
husband-NOM money-DAT (it-)me-lV-give-TS-he(PRES)
'(my) husband gives me (the) money'122GEORGI AN GRAMMARvs with the e-vowel that I call here 'Indirect Object Version':
šen
me
pul-i
mo-(0-0-)m-e-c-i
you(ERG) me(DAT) money-NOM PREV-(you-it-)me-I OV-giveINDIC(AOR)
'you gave (the) money to me'
vs with Objective Version:
me
ma-s
ra-s
I (NOM) X-DAT what?-DAT
'what shall I do to/with X?'v-(0-0-)u-zam?
I-(it-X-)OV-do(FUT)Given two sets of pronominal agreement-affixes, the subject usually
selects its marker from Set A, whilst the object is shewn by a Set B affix
(e.g. m-nax-av-s meB-see-TS-XA(FUT) 'X will see me'), whereas in part of
a transitive verb's set of paradigms and for certain verbs throughout their
conjugation the subject selects its marker from Set B, whilst the object is
indicated by a Set A affix (e.g. ar m-i-nax-av-s not I B - O V - s e e TS(PERF)-XA
'I have not seen X', m-q'+av-x-a + r 4
IB-have-youAbe(PRES) 'I have you').
Any individual verb-form will be classifiable as (i) Transitive, (ii)
Intransitive (passive), (iii) Medial, (iv) Indirect, (v) Stative. Whilst a single
root does not normally manifest all five types, let us take the root e'er in
an attempt to illustrate each of them: (i) (Ø-Ø-)c'er (you-X-)write(PRES)
'you write X/them', (ii) i-c'er-eb-a PASS-write-TS-X(PRES)
'X is being
written', (iii) (Ø-)c'er-a-ob which is quoted from Holisky (1981.75) as the
slang expression 'you screw around', (iv) (?)m-e-c'er-eb-a
I-IOV-writeTS-X(PRES)'\ feel like writing' 5 , (v) s-c'er-i-a ?-write-STAT(PRES)-X 'X is
(sc. in a state of having been) written'.
GEORGIAN'scomplement of tense-mood-aspect forms (generically
referred to by Kartvelologists as 'screeves' from theGEORGIANword
mc'k'riv-i 'row') are divided into three 'Series': Series I consists of Prešent
Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive, Imperfect Indicative [together constituting
the Prešent Sub-Series], Future Indicative, Future Subjunctive and
Conditional [collectively constituting the Future Sub-Series]; Series 11
incorporates just the Aorist Indicative (or Simple Past) and Aorist
Subjunctive (called by some 'Optative'); Series 111 contains the Perfect
(which screeve, when used without a negative, often implies that the
speaker is drawing an inference from some prešent evidence that some
event must have preceded or that he is reporting hearsay about anVERBAl MORPHOlOGY123unwitnessed occurrence, rather than describing an event actually
witnessed such that he can vouchsafe for the truth of what he is saying),
Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive. This three-way division is not merely
fundamental for the tripartite distinction in the morpho-syntactic marking
of subject and object of Transitive (and Medial) verbs discussed
morphologically in 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3 as well as syntactically in 5.1.7, but also
facilitates the description of the morphological patterning of the various
sub-types of verb.
Roots are normally associated with one or more preverbs, which
typically appear(s) in aspectually perfective forms 6 (which in gross terms
may be taken to mean screeves other than those of the Prešent Sub-Series,
though there are exceptions predominantly with preverbless Series 11
formations). A problem is that, apart from with verbs of motion, it is almost
always impossible to predict which preverb(s) a given root will select. Also
the lexical meaning to be assigned to a particular verb-form is often a
function not just of the root but of the union of root with this or that
preverb (some other concomitant changes, such as to the Thematic Suffix
or Version vowel, may also occur). Examples: out of the basic root c'er we
can produce such Future Indicatives as: (i) da-(Ø-)c'er-s PREV-(Y-)writeX'X will write (Y)', (ii) mi-(Ø-)s-c'er-s PREV-(Y-)Z-write.to-X 'X will write
(Y) to Z', (iii) mo-(Ø-)g-c'er-s PREV-(Y-)you-write.to-X 'X will write (Y) to

"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY4974.10.3 Variable Actant Marking
The root -)in-, construed with either da- or c'a- as preverb, can be used
in two ways to convey the concept of 'going to sleep': the verb can be
formally Transitive, as in bavšv-ma t'k'b+il-ad ča-(?Ø-)i-)in-a 'the
child fell sweetly to sleep' (=> Perfect bavšv-s ča-(Ø-)u-)in-i-a), or
alternatively the root may take the shape of an Indirect Verb, as in
baväv-s t'k'b+il-ad ča-(Ø-)e-)in-a 'the child fell sweetly to sleep' (=>
Perfect bavšv-s ča-s-)in-eb-i-a). Similarly the antonym -gvij-, with
either ga- or ga-mo- as preverb, can be construed either Transitively or
as an Indirect Verb in the meaning 'wake up/sober up' (e.g. b a v š v - m a
xma+ur+oba-ze ga-(mo-)(?Ø-)i-gvij-a 'the child woke at the noise' (=>
Perfect baväv-s ga-(mo-)(Ø-)u-gvij-(n-)i-a) = bavšv-s xma+ur+oba-ze ga-(mo-)(Ø-)e-gvij-a (=> Perfect baväv-s ga-(mo-)(Ø-)
gvij-eb-i-a).
In the case of the root -tvlem- 'snooze, slumber', although the c a š
marking of the snoozer varies in the same way as in the previous two
example-roots, the actual shape of the verb itself only varies between
Transitive and Indirect in Series III. Transitively we have: mo+x+u+c-i
(ča-)tvlem-s 'the old man is snoozing/will fall into a snooze' vs Aorist
mo+x+u+c-ma ča-(?Ø-)tvlim-a vs Perfect mo+x+u+c-s ša-(Ø-)utvlem-i-a; the alternative paradigm is: mo+x+u+c-s (ča-)(s-)tvlem-s
'the old man is snoozing/will fall into a snooze' vs Aorist mo+x+u+c-s ča(s-)tvlim-a vs Perfect mo+x+u+c-s ča-(s-)tvlem-i-a. It is difficult to
detect any difference in meaning between the three pairs from the
examples given in KEGl. However, in the case of some other verbs
describing bodily functions, it is perhaps possible to point to a semantic
distinction.
In the example cocxal-i adam+ian-i an cxvir-s da-(?Ø-?Ø-?Ø)ac-em-in-eb-s 2 7 9
an da-(?Ø-)a-mtknar-eb-s da an a-mo-(?Ø-)aslok'in-eb-s 'a living person either will sneeze or yawn or again produce
a hiccup' 28Ø .
All three verbs are formally Transitive with the
sneezer/yawner/hiccuper in the Nominative case as subject of a Transitive
Verb in the Future Indicative. If these verbs were in a Series II screeve,
the subject would be Ergative, but this is not so in the following example:
p'ap'a-s sc'ore+d a+m dro-s cxvir-s da-(?Ø-?Ø-)a-c-em-in-a 'it
was precisely at this time that the priest sneezed', where the sneezer is in
the Dative. Perhaps the context is hinting that the sneeze came at an
embarrassing moment for the priest, so that to underline the non-deliberate
nature of the act, the sneezer is made indirect object, leaving the subject
(Nature, God, Providence?) and direct object, though cross-referenced in498GEORGIANGRAMMARthe verb, actually undefined. It would follow from this that the normal
subject-marking for Transitive Verbs assigned to the noun 'person' in the
first example is to suggest that these are deliberate acts that one might
expect from 'the living person'. We can also have indirect-object marking
for yawners and hiccupers (e.g. tu jil-i mo-g-e-r-ev-a, albat da(?Ø-)g-a-mtknar-eb-?s 'if sleep gets the better of you, you will probably
yawn' vs without preverb bavSv-s mtel-i sa+gam+o (?Ø-Ø-)a-mtknar?a 'the baby had a fit of yawning the whole evening'; p'armen-s (?ØØ-)a-slok'in-?a mtel-i dge 'P'armen had an attack of the hiccups the
whole day'). Similarly for 'coughing' we have both the Transitive ekim-is
txov+n-it bavšv-ma da-(?Ø-)a-xvel-a 'at the request of the doctor
the child coughed' vs the alternative inglis+el-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)a-xvel-a,
roca araq'-ma q'el-i da-(Ø-)s-c'v-a 'the Englishman coughed when the
vodka burnt his throat'. For 'belching' it seems that only the Indirect
method is possible, as in m+s+m+el-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)a-boq'in-a 'the drinker
belched'. According to the dictionaries [KEGl and Tschenkčli), in Series
III the verbs prešented for 'sneezing', 'yawning', 'hiccuping', 'coughing' and
'belching' permit only the Transitive forms, so that the Perfects are
respectively: (da-)(Ø-)u-c-em-in-eb-i-a, (da-)(Ø-)u-mtknar-eb-i-a,
(a-mo-)(Ø-)u-slok'in-eb-i-a, d a - ( Ø - ) u - x v e l - e b - i - a , d a - ( Ø - ) u boq'in-eb-i-a. An alternative root for 'sneeze', -cxik'v-, is Transitive
throughout (viz. (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)a-cxik , v-eb 'you (will) sneeze' => Aorist
(da-)(Ø-?Ø-)a-cxik'v-e => Perfect ( d a - ) g - i - c x i k ' v - e b - i - a ) . For
'snoring' we have the Medial Verb (Ø-)xvrin-av 'you snore' => Future (Ø?Ø-)i-xvrin-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xvrin-e => Perfect g-i-xvrin-i-a.
For 'spitting' the verb is a normal Transitive, as seen in the proverb a-v(?Ø-)a-purtx-e—ulvaš-s mo-(Ø-)xvd-a, da-v-(?Ø-)a-purtx-e—
c ' v e r - e b - s a - o 'I spat upwards—it caught (my) moustache, I spat
downwards—(it caught my) beard, they say'; similarly for 'urinating'
((mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)šard-av or (mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)ps-am) and 'defalcating'
((mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)jv-am).
We have fluctuation between the direct and indirect construction with
the formally bivalent Intransitive Verb 'be worthy of', as seen in the
contrasting syntax of: ro+di+s (Ø-)e-gir+s-eb-od-nen i+s+i+n-i a+m
si+k'et+e-s, rom ar q'+op-il-i-q'+o m+c'er+al-ta k'avšir-i? 'when
would theyNOM have been worthy of this kindnessDAT. if there had not
been a union of Writers?', which construction is seen again in this quote
from Vazha Pshavela: k'ide+v v-(Ø-)e-gir+s-e ga+zapxul-s 'I again
was worthy (of seeing) the spring', but in the next quote from
C'avč'avadze the c a š m a r k i n g of the arguments is reversed: c'minda-a
i+gi, vi-sa-c (Ø-)e-gir+s-a mam+ul-is-tvis tav-is da+d+eb+a 'pureVERBAl MORPHOlOGY499is he for whomDAT the laying downNOM of his life was a worthy thing to
do*.
Another kind of fluctuation has been examined by Tuite (1987; 1993).
He points out the subtle difference between such verbal usages as: deda
bavšv-eb-s (Ø-)a-int'eres-eb-s zgap'r-eb-it 'the mother is keeping
the children interested with fairty-tales' (the plurality of the direct object
is not marked on the verb) vs bavšv-eb-s (Ø-)a-int'eres-eb-t zgap'reb-i 'the children are interested in fairy-tales' (where, he argues, the
morphological direct object is treated as the syntactic subject and thus
now does have its plurality marked on the verb). We then have in contrast
to the latter an inceptive formation: bavšv-eb-i int'eres-d-eb-i-an
zgap'r-eb-it 'the children are getting interested in fairy-tales'. In Series
III both the latter constructions are permissible for this verb, giving in the
Perfect: zgap'r-eb-s da-(Ø-)u-int'eres-eb-i-a bavšv-eb-i 'fairy-tales
have interested the children' vs bavšv-eb-i
da-int'eres-eb-ul-an
zgap'r-eb-it 'the children have become interested in fairy-tales'.
Consider now such verbs as: (da-)(Ø-)a-elm-eb-s 'X makes/will make
Y/them cross-eyed', (da-i-(Ø-)a-k'ut'-eb-s = (da-)(Ø-)a-sap'q'r-eb-s 'X
makes/will make Y/them crippled', (ga-)(Ø-)a-p'ir+kuš-eb-s 'X puts/will
put Y/them in a bad mood', (ga-)(Ø-)a-rind-eb-s 'X makes/will make
Y/them mute', (ag-)(Ø-)a-t'q'in-eb-s 'X makes/will make Y/them ecstatic',
(da-)(Ø-)a-pikr+ian-eb-s 'X makes/will make Y/them pensive', (ag-)(Ø-)
a-prt+ovan-eb-s 'X thrIIIs/will thrIII Y/them', (a-)(Ø-)a-caxcax-eb-s
'X makes/will make Y/them tremble', (mo-)(Ø-)tent-av-s 'X relaxes/will
relax Y/them'. These verbs are paralleled by Intransitive forms like: (da-)
(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i 'you (will) become cross-eyed', (da-)(Ø-)k'ut'-d-eb-i =
(da-)(Ø-)sap'q'r-d-eb-i 'you (will) become crippled', (mo-)(Ø-)i-tenteb-i 'you are being/will be relaxed' etc... Whilst one would expect both
Transitive and Intransitive paradigms to be complete across the three
screeve-series, it seems from Tuite's work that, in his words: 'speakers
appear not to regard these parallel forms as composing two separate
paradigms, but rather as elements of a single paradigm with a degree of
morphological and syntactic variability in it' (1993.6). Though speakerjudgments differ somewhat among themselves and for different verbs, Tuite
found that for the verb 'make/become cross-eyed', the Transitive
construction was preferred in the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. g-a-elm-eb-s
'X (say, watching TV) makes you cross-eyed' is better than
(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i 'you go cross-eyed (from watching TV)', with - g a n
expressing the cause), whereas in the Future Sub-Series the preference
shifted to the Intransitive variant (viz. Future da-(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i) though
the Transitive ( d a - g - a - e l m - e b - s ) is stIII acceptable; in Series II5ØØGEORGIANGRAMMARpreference for the Intransitive (Aorist da-(Ø-)elm-d-i) was so strong as
to make the Transitive (da-g-a-elm-a) questionable, whilst in Series III
only the Intransitive (Perfect da-(Ø-)elm-eb-ul-x-a+r vs Transitive da(Ø-Ø-)u-elm-eb-i-x-a+r) seemed permissible at all.
4.10.4 Similarities across the sub-types of verb
We have already seen examples where a Transitive verb (e.g. man ča(?Ø-)i-)in-a ' X E R G fell asleep') is hardly, if at all, distinguishable in šense
from an Indirect Verb (viz. ma-s ča-(Ø-)e-)in-?a ' X D A T fell asleep').
Equally there are examples where a Transitive Verb stands very close in
meaning to an Intransitive Verb (e.g. kal-ma tval-eb-i kmar-s mi-(ØØ-)a-št'er-a 'the womanERG fixed her eyes on [= stared atj (her) husband'
vs kal-i tval-eb-it mi-(Ø-)a-št'er-d-a munj-s 'the womanNOM stared
with (her) eyes at the dumb one'; mxar-s da-(Ø-)g-i-čer 'I'll support you
(lit. grip your shoulder)' vs mo-g-e-mxr-ob-i 'I'll side with you'; glexeb-ma bat'on-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)u-čok-es 'the peasantsERG knelt before the
master' vs šen mt'er-s ar c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-čok-e 'youNOM refused to
kneel before the foe'; kal-ma c'arb-eb-i še-(Ø-)i-č'mux(v)n-a 'the
w o m a n E R G knitted her eyebrows' vs kal-i
še-i-č'mux(v)n-a
'the
womanNOM frowned'; kurd-ma tav-i še-(Ø-Ø-)a-par-a bosel-s (or
tav-i če-(Ø-?Ø-)a-par-a bosel-ši) vs kurd-i bosel-s
še-(Ø-)exizn-a/še-(Ø-)e-k'edl-a 'the thief took refuge in the barn'). And one
can also point to cases where an Intransitive Verb seems little different in
šense from a Medial (e.g. i+s ma-s mi-(Ø-)e-švel-a ' X N O M went to
help/helped YDAT' vs man ma-s (?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-a 'XERG aided Y D A T ' ) .","[515, 516, 517, 518, 519]"

5.22.3.1.6 Indirect Questions
As long as it is clear from the context to whom the question refers, one
always has the choice of repeating the original question with the
appropriate speech-particle. Yes/No-questions are treated like alternative
questions containing the words tu ara 'or not', and both end up with these
same words in the indirect question, which shews appropriate changes of
person and tense, e.g.
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-i (?0-)gv-e-k'itx-eb-od-a,

WH-questions continue to place the WH-word (or the phrase containing

especially where there is other material in the clause preceding the WHword, the indirect question may be introduced by the particle tu, e.g.

5.22.3.1.7 Fearing Clauses
There is a great variety of strategies available to convey a fear. Perhaps
the simplest way to express a positive fear is to use the appropriate tense
of the indicative, preferably accompanied by the speech-particle and also
by either vai-tu 'woe if' or xom ar 'surely not?', e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a,
vai-tu rus-eb-i
I-IOV-fear-PRES-it
Russian-Pl-NOM
šmo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an(=me+tk+i)

PRES
AOR
'I am afraid that the Russians will attack us // may be attacking us //
may have attacked us'which may be alternatively expressed by replacing vai-tu by xom ar
placed after the SUBJect rus-eb-i. These two variants, which are based
on direct quotation, sit happily alongside any tense in the introductory
verb, so that replacing m-e-šin-i-a above by the past m-e-šin-od-a
would give the equivalents of 'I was afraid the Russians would attack us //
were attacking us // had attacked us'.
An alternative is to turn the fearing clause into a negative wish (sc.
that something may not happen or may not be happening), which joins the
negative particle ar to the appropriate SUBJunctive (viz. Aorist for an
event in the future vs Prešent for one contemporaneous with the fear).
Such expressions may optionally be introduced by the complementiser rom
and optionally accompanied by the relevant speech-particle. The aboveexample in this variation would be:
m-e-šin-i-a,
(rom)
rus-eb-i

your(Pl.)-AGRNote that this strategy is not available if the feared event precedes the
moment the fear itself is being expressed. In the case of a simple fear for
the future after a non-past main verb the Future Indicative, with or
without rom, is possible, e.g.
m-e-šin-i-a, (rom) rus-eb-i še-mo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an

After a past tense introductory verb a fear relating to the future
relative to the expression of that fear may be expressed by ar 'not'
accompanying the Pluperfect Indicative without any speech-particle; the
complementiser rom is optional, e.g.

The above-examples of fearing clauses have exemplified howGEORGIAN
conveys a fear that something may happen / / may be happening // may
have happened. If the fear itself is that something may not happen // be
happening / / have happened, then the complementiser rom is preferably
retained with the negative ar and a non-SUBJunctive verb in the
appropriate tense (apart from the Pluperfect), e.g.","[637, 638, 639, 640]"

3.8I nterjections(áoris+d+eb+ul-eb-i)In Otar Gachechiladze's 1979 monograph on interjections no fewer than 86
pages (138 to 224) are devoted to an alphabetical list of the language's
interjections with examples from literature. Clearly in this section no more
than a short selection can be offered.
A large number are used for encouraging or warding off various kinds
of animals, as one might expect from a still largely rural country.
Examples: aga-gag-aa or azgamo (to frighten dogs), agamuči or briekssie or čiee or nt'rieee (to drive sheep), atpri or haam(o(o)) (to
hurry bulls), at' or čpveooo (sign of wrath to cattle), akša or kšiii (to
alarm birds), ači ači or ace (to get a donkey moving), aču (to get a horse
started), acxa (to shoo away a cat), bela(h) (to drive sheep or goats),
diido (to settle a cow), einc' einc' einc' (to attract a pig), tbpe [sic!] or
pšvie e e (to attract cattle), tokš toká (to stop a donkey), tp tp tp (to
attract a horse), tpee oho or ogečo (to shew anger to cattle), m a a m o h
(to shew affection to cattle), mc'a (to quieten a dog), nja nja or nc'a
nc'a (to shew anger to dogs), ot'p'u or ot'pru (to hurry water-buffalo),
rru rru rruo or ǰiôi ǰiôi or ǰu ǰu ǰu ǰuk'r (to attract poultry), sih sih
sih or ssi ssi or ps or kss kss or haha(a) (to quieten dogs), tpeo ho
(to halt a bull or buffalo), čiš (to halt or drive a donkey), cicu=cicu (to
attract cats), cxa=cxa (to frighten mice or to shoo off cats), xi(i) (to get
bulls or buffalo to alter direction), hae(e) (to encourage bulls), hop't'u (to
drive water-buffalo), hohoo (to bring bulls to a halt).
Some have quite specific meanings, others may have a variety of often
contradictory senses determined by the context. Examples: aba (da) ha
or aba he lends encouragement (e.g. aba he xel-i da-(Ø-Ø-)gv-a-banin-e-t 'well O.K. then, allow us to wash our hands!'), alo (on answering the
phone), arika(t) 'careful!', apsus = maxlas 'what a pity!', agu (mothers100GEORGIANGRAMMARmimic this imitation of a baby's first utterance to soothe the child), a(a)h
may indicate emotion, prohibition, approval, a wish, regret, greeting,
surprise, sadness, fear e t c . , barakala 'well done!', bis 'encore!', bravo =
q'očag 'bravo!', gan+i 'break! (in dancing/wrestling)', deda (deda) literally
'mother!' with first syllable rise and second syllable fall is used for regret
or suprise, e(e) shews censure, grief, regret, impossibility, encouragement,
threat, surprise, fear, warning, sigh, displeasure e t c . , e(e)x indicates
wrath, grief, sadness, sighing, regret, e(e)h shews complaint, depression,
satisfaction, dissatisfaction, wrath, wishing, censure, agreement, mockery,
offence, sadness, regret, e t c . , vai(me) (cf. vah(me)) is common in
complaints and expressions of depression, weakness, torment, cursing,
anger, pleading e t c . , vax (vax) shews regret, censure, sadness, praise
and pride, mc' or m n c ' u or mc'u or nc'u doubles for ara 'no', nc'u nc'u
n c ' u 'deary me', o(o)x or o(o)h can shew sadness, anger, loathing,
wishing, pleasure, threat, pity, greeting, emotion, gratitude, satisfaction
e t c . , s + dek = st'op' 'halt!', su(s) or ssu 'shh', bst' bst' or t's(s) 'pst',
u(u) or (uu)ui or uime or uh or he(e) can convey almost anything, u(u)x
expresses a strong wish or praise, pi or pu(i) or puuu or puh s h e w
displeasure or loathing, še+s+dek 'halt! (to an opponent)', čup , ri=čup , ar
encourages a dancer, č it'a 'gotcha! (in hide-and-seek)', xabarda 'make
way!', haida(=haa) 'away!', hait' shews anger, h(h)u mainly signifies
anger, sadness, dissatisfaction.
3.8.1 Pseudo-interjections
Three terms of endearment/affection, used especially by older to younger
people or, in the case of the first two, by lovers are: šen-i č ir-i-me, ge-na+cva(l-e), and g-e-taq'va(n-e). The last (in its full guise) is an
Aorist verb-form meaning 'I worshipped you', the second an Aorist meaning
'I substituted for you', and the first comes from a full expression of the
type:
šen-i
č
ir-i
me
še-m-e-q'ar-o-s
your-AGR woe-NOM me(DAT) PREV-me-IOV-t:ast.upon-AOR.SUBJ-it
'may your woe be cast upon me'
(sc. 'may I take over your suffering and relieve you of it', which, of course,
is the basic šentiment of g-e-na+cva(l-e) too <= na+cval-i 'substitute').
Similar also is the verb-form še-mo-g-e-vl-e (literally) 'I encircled/went
round you', referring either to actual movement round the person or to a
symbolic circling movement of the hand over the person's chest, bothNON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY101rituals performed in order to transfer the target's troubles onto the
performer of this action7.
3.9 DerivationalMorphologyGEORGIANmakes extensive use of both suffixation and circumfixation.
Individual words suggest the prešence of prefixes alone, but such prefixes
are not productive (sc. other, perhaps, than in combination with some
suffixal element as part-constituent of a circumfix).
Examples:
mo-/me-: as in mo-isar-i/me-isar-i 'archer' <= isar-i 'arrow';
n a - : in addition to being a formant of often substantivised past
participles (cf. 4.9.5 for examples like na-rg-av=na-tes-i 'what has been
planted and sown' <= (da-)rg-v-a 'planting' + (da-)tes-v-a 'sowing') it is
found in such nouns as na-p'ir-i 'bank (sc. of river)' <= p'ir-i 'face, mouth';
ne-: as in ne-rg-i 'young plant' <= (da-)rg-v-a 'planting';
sa-dg-om-i 'place to stay' <= dg-om-a 'standing'; sa-šiš-i 'dangerous'
<= šiš-i 'fear';
si-je 'son-/brother-in-law' <= je 'son';
u-rč-i 'disobedient' (cf. mo-rč-il-i 'obedient').
3.9.1 Noun-derivation
-a: this suffix seems very common in the names of plants, often built on
adjective-noun, noun-adjective or Genitive-noun combinations (e.g. cxrat'q'av-a 'Iberian honeysuckle' <= cxra t'q'av-i '9 skins', cocx-magar-a
'Lythrum virgatum' <= cocx-i magar-i 'brush firm = firm brush', cxen-isk'b+il-a 'Leucojum æstivum' <= cxen-is k'b+il-i 'horse's tooth', ded-isert-a 'only child' <= ded-is 'a mother's' + ert-i T). From lurj-i 'blue' is
formed lurj-a 'blue-one, Bluey', which is often used as the proper name of
an appropriately coloured horse; c'itel-a 'measles' <= c'itel-i 'red',
papxur-a 'boaster' <= papxur-i 'shewing off'.
Note the combination of
suffixes in the diminutive tag-un-a (= tag-un-ia) 'little mouse'. All such
formations have Genitive singular in -a-s(a); on the other hand, masdars
formed by -a (see 4.9.1) have their Genitives in -is(a);
-ak'-i: this is a diminutive suffix (e.g. potol-ak'-i 'little leaf; sepal' <=
potol-i 'leaf'; gil-ak'-i 'button (= switch)' <= gil-i '(clothes') button');
-eba: this widely used abstract-noun formant is to be distinguished
from the ending -eb-a, which, as discussed in 4.9.1, is the Masdar ending102GEORGI AN GRAMMARfor verbs whose Thematic Suffix is -eb-, though Masdars are sometimes
used with what is tantamount to abstract-meaning—the Genitive singular of
both is -eb-is(a) (e.g. val+d+eb+ul-eba 'obligation' <= val+d+eb+ul-i
'obliged', čv+e+ul-eba 'habit' <= čv+e+ul-i 'usual', ert + g u l - e b a
'faithfulness' <= ert+gul-i 'faithful', da+mo+k'id+eb+ul-eba 'dependence'
<= da+mo+k'id+eb+ul-i 'dependent');
-ed-i: not a common suffix (e.g. gan-ed-i 'latitude' <= gan-i 'width',
g r j - e d - i 'longitude' <= g r j + e l - i 'long', t a n a - v a r s k ' v l a v - e d - i
'constellation' <= varsk'vlav-i 'star', q'vavil-ed-i 'mass of flowers on
stem' <= q'vavil-i 'flower', otx-k'utx-ed-i 'rectangle, quadrilateral' <=
otx-i '4' + k'utxe 'angle, corner', sam-k'utx-ed-i 'triangle', at-c'1-ed-i
'a 10-grade middle-school' <= at-i '10' + c'el-i 'year');
-et-i: this shews the place designated for the nominal stem (e.g. svanet-i 'Svaneti(a)' <= svan-i 'Svan (person)', os-et-i 'Ossetia' <= os-i 'Ossete',
somx-et-i 'Armenia' <= somex-i 'Armenian (person)', m+k'vd+r-et-i
'place of the dead/old graveyard' <= m+k'vd+ar-i 'dead person');
-ia: this is an affectionate diminutive with Genitive singular in -ia-s(a)
(e.g. bij-ia 'dear uncle' <= bija 'uncle'). It may be combined in the suffixal
sequence -un-ia (e.g. pis-un-ia 'little puss' <= piso 'puss');
+ial-i: a number of verbs of movement or sound-production contain this
element, which presumably was once a suffix (bod+ial-i 'aimless talking', it
also means 'aimless wandering' in which šense it has the synonyms
bor+ial-i and xet'+ial-i);
-ik'o: this is another affectionate diminutive (e.g. ded-ik'o 'mother
dear', da-ik'o 'dear sister', beb-ik'o = beb-o 'dear granma');
-il+o: this affectionate diminutive is only found in the Vocative, i.e. as a
form of address (e.g. ded-il+o! 'mum!', beb-il+o! 'gran!'). Also only found
in the Vocative is jal-o 'auntie!', affectionate diminutive of bi+col+a =
bij-is col-i 'aunt' = 'uncle's wife';
-nar- (-nal-i, if there is an - r - in the root): this is used to shew a
plantation or collection of types of tree (e.g. mux-nar-i 'oak-plantation' <=
muxa 'oak', arq'-nar-i/arq'-nal-i 'birch-plantation' <= arq'i 'birch', ipn[n]ar-i 'ash-grove' <= ip(a)n-i 'ash', bu<?k-nar-i 'bush-thicket' <= bučk-i
'bush'—cf. kviá-nar-i 'sandy place' <= kviša 'sand');
-ob-i: not a common suffix (e.g. maġa-ob-i 'high ground' <= maġal-i
'high, tall', kvišr-ob-i 'sandy place' <= kviáa 'sand');
-oba: this extremely common suffix is to be distinguished from -ob-a,
the Masdar ending for verbs with Thematic Suffix -ob- though Masdars
are sometimes used with what is tantamount to abstract-meaning—the
Genitive singular of both is -ob-is(a) (e.g. kal+1+áv+il-oba 'maidenhood,
virginity' <= kal+i+šv+il-i 'maiden, daughter', u+gvt+o-oba 'godlessness'NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY103<= u + g v t + o 'godless', da+mo+u + k'id + eb + 1-oba
'independence' <=
da+mo+u+k'id+eb+el-i 'independent', mo+u+tm+en+1-oba 'impatience'
<= mo+u+tm+en+el-i 'impatient');
-ua: this is an infrequent diminutive with Genitive singular in -ua-s(a)
(e.g. bič'-ua 'laddie', jal-ua 'auntie (uncle's wife)');
-uk'-i/-uk'a: sparsely used diminutive suffixes (e.g. bušt-uk'-i
'bladder', bebr-uk'a 'little old lady', which has the synonyms bebr-ucuna/bebr-ux-ana, all three with Genitives in -a-s(a));
-ula: another infrequent diminutive with Genitive singular in -ula-s(a)
(e.g. burt-ula 'little ball' <= burt-i 'ball');
+un: this element, like +ial-i above, must once have been a suffix that
has become solidified to the root of a number of verbs indicating soundproduction (e.g. brax+un-i 'stamping, knocking' cf. brax+a=brux-i 'noise,
rumpus', žgar+un-i 'tinkling', čxap'+un-i 'splashing' <= čxap , +a=čxup , -i
'splashing about', t ' q ' a p ' + u n - i 'beating, slapping'). Note the suffixal
sequences in 'little chap', dat-un-ia 'little bear' (Genitive dat-un-ias(a)) ;
-ura: this seems to be prešent in bad-ura 'netting' <= bade 'net', k'exura 'an apple-variety' named after the Kartlian village of K'exvi—Genitive
singular is in -ura-s(a); whether this suffix is prešent or not in begura
'sparrow', the Genitive is begur-is(a);
m - -ar-i: dissimilated to -al-i if the stem contains an -r-. This is
esšentially a Prešent Participle formant, but the resulting forms are largely
substantivised (e.g. m-k'vl+ev-ar-i 'researcher', m-c'er-al-i 'writer');
m—el-i: esšentially a Prešent Participle formant, often substantivised
(e.g. m - s m + e n - e l - i 'listener', m - s m - e l - i 'drinker', m-šen+eb-el-i
'builder');
ma- -el-i: esšentially a Prešent Participle formant, often substantivised
(e.g. ma-t'ar + eb-el-i 'train (lit. conveyor)', d a - m a - a + r + s + e b - e l - i
'founder', ma-sc'avl+eb-el-i 'teacher', ma-q'ur+eb-el-i 'viewer');
me—ar-i: this is found in me-om-ar-i 'warrior' <= om-i 'war';
me—e: this extremely common circumfix forms agent-nouns around
nominal roots (e.g. m e - v e n a x - e 'viticulturist' <= venax-i 'vine', m e gvin-e 'wine-producer' <= gvino 'wine', me-bag-e 'gardener' <= bag-i
'garden', m e - c x v a r - e 'shepherd' <= cxvar-i 'sheep', m e - a p t i a k - e
'chemist' <= aptiak-i 'pharmacy')—see 3.2.3.2 and 3.9.2 for this circumfix's
role as marker of ordinals;
me—e+d-i: this circumfix derives from the Adverbial case of ordinals,
which stem is then turned into a noun to form fractions, though 'half' has
the separate na+x+ev+ar-i (e.g. me-sam-e+d-i 'one third', me-at-e+d-i
'one tenth');104GEORGIANGRAMMARme- -ier-i: this is seen in me-cn-ier-i 'scientist, scholar';
me- -ur-i dissimilated to -ul-i if there is an -r- in the root (e.g. m e z g v a - u r - i 'sailor' <= zgva 'sea', m e - b a r g - u l - i 'porter' <= b a r g - i
'luggage');
mo- -ar-i dissimilated to -al-i if there is an - r - in the root. This
again is basically a Prešent Participle formant whose results are often
substantivised (e.g. mo-mger-al-i 'singer' <= (Ø-)mger-i 'you sing', m o čiv-ar-i 'complainant' <= (Ø-)čiv-i 'you complain');
mo- -e: another participle formant whose results are sometimes
substantivised (e.g. mo-nadir-e 'hunter' <= (Ø-)nadir-ob 'you hunt', m o c'ap-e 'pupil' <= (Ø-)e-c'ap-eb-i 'you apply yourself diligently to X', m o cek'v+av-e 'dancer' <= (Ø-)cek'v-av 'you dance');
na- -al-i: this is an archaic formant for fractions (e.g. na-sam-al-i
'one third');
na- -ar-i dissimilated to -al-i if there is an - r - in the root. This
indicates the site where the noun constituting the root once was (e.g. nasaxl-ar-i 'site of an old house', n a - m o n a s t ' r - a l - i 'site of former
monastery')—cf. na-bol-ar-a (Genitive in -a-s(a)) 'last born', which may
also be used adjectivally (e.g. na-bol-ar-a goč'-i 'last born piglet = runt');
na- ev-i: this is synonymous with the previous exponent (e.g. n a kalak-ev-i 'site of former town', na-sadil-ev-i 'afternoon' <= sadil-i
'lunch', or-na-kmr-ev-i 'woman who has had two husbands' <= or-i '2' +
kmar-i 'husband');
sa- -ar-i dissimilated to -al-i if there is an - r - in the root. This
circumfix basically forms some Future Participles (see 4.9.3), some of which
are substantivised (e.g. sa-pikr-al-i 'object for thought' <= (Ø-)pikr-ob
'you think', sa-c'ov-ar-i 'teat, nipple' (cf. sa-c'ov-ar-a 'dummy', whose
Genitive is in -a-s(a)) <= (Ø-Ø-)c'ov 'you suck X', sa-čiv-ar-i 'complaint'
<= (Ø-)čiv-i 'you complain');
sa- -e: this very common formant shews the thing designed to hold the
root (e.g. sa-maril-e 'salt-cellar' <= maril-i 'salt', sa-katm-e 'chickencoop' <= k a t a m - i 'chicken', sa-gor-e 'pigsty' <= gor-i 'pig', sa-perpl-e
'ash-tray' <= perpl-i 'ash', sa-burnut-e 'snuff-box' <= burnut-i 'snuff);
sa- -et-i: this is synonymous with -et-i plus an extra prefix (e.g. saprang-et-i 'France', sa-berjn-et-i 'Greece');
sa- -el-i: this is the main formant for Future Participles, some of
which have been substantivised (e.g. sa-s+m-el-i 'drink, beverage' <= ( 0 0-)sv-am 'you drink (X)', sa-č'm-el-i 'food' <= (0-0-)č'am 'you eat (X)').
Occasionally the suffix is of the form -el-a (Genitive in -a-s(a)) (e.g. saprtx + o b - e l - a 'scarecrow' <= (Ø-Ø-)a-prtx-ob 'you alarm X', s a xrč+ob-el-a 'scaffold' <= (Ø-Ø-)a-xrč-ob 'you hang X');NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY105sa- -is-i: this is a rare coupling (e.g. sa-s+m-is-i 'drinking vessel',
sa-dg-is-i 'awl', sa-c'q'-is-i 'infinitive' cf. da-sa-c'q'-is-i 'beginning' <=
(Ø-)i-c'q'-eb 'you begin (X)');
sa—o: this is used, somewhat like -et-i, to mark the place designated
for the root (e.g. sa-kart+v+el-o 'Georgia' = 'place designed for the
GEORGIANs(kart+v+el-eb-i)', sa-st'umr-o 'hotel' <= st'umar-i 'guest',
sa-bat'on-o 'dominion of the master' <= bat'on-i 'master' cf. sa-me+p-o
'kingdom' <= me+p+e 'king' and sa-up+1-o 'dominion of a lord' <= up+al-i
'lord'). With kinship-terms it derives the form for 'future RELATION' (e.g.
kmar-i 'husband' => sa-kmr-o 'fiancé', rjal-i 'daughter-/sister-in-law' =>
sa-rjl-o 'future daughter-/sister-in-law', si+mam+r-i 'father-in-law (for
males)' => sa-si+mam+r-o 'future father-in-law (for males)', deda+mt+iH
'mother-in-law (for females)' => sa-deda+mt+il-o 'future mother-in-law
(for females)'—N.B. col-i 'wife' => sa-col-e 'fiancée');
sa—ur-i dissimilated to -ul-i if there is an -r- in the root. It is not
a common coupling (e.g. sa-dg-ur-i 'station' <= dg-om-a 'standing', sapex-ur-i 'step, rung' <= pex-i 'foot', sa-rt-ul-i 'storey' <= še-rt-v-a
'joining', sa-tb-ur-i 'greenhouse' <= tb-il-i 'warm');
se- -a: is this an old circumfix seen today in se+p+a 'marquee' and
se+t'q'v+a 'hail'?
se—e: this is seen only in se-p-e = sa-me+p-o 'kingdom';
si—a: this is an old Masdar formant seen in some substantivised forms
(e.g. si-t'q'v-a 'word' cf. (Ø-Ø-)i-t'q'v-i 'you will say (X)', si-mger-a
'song' <= (Ø-)mger-i 'you sing');
si- -ar-i: this is only seen in si-zm-ar-i 'dream' cf. z m - a n - e b - a
'dream';
si—e: this common formant produces nouns from adjectives (e.g. simartl-e 'truth' <= martal-i 'true', si-cocxl-e 'life' <= cocxal-i 'alive', sicx-e 'heat, temperature' <= cx-el-i 'hot', si-mok'l-e 'shortness' <= mok'le
'short', si-mk'vircxl-e 'nimbleness' <= mk'vircxal-i 'nimble', si-mq'ral-e
'stink' <= mq'ral-i 'fetid');
si- -ed-i: si-gan-ed-i and si-grj-ed-i are synonyms for gan-ed-i
'latitude' and grj-ed-i 'longitude' respectively;
si- —il—i: this is another old Masdar formant found still in some
substantivised forms (e.g. si-k'vd-il-i 'death' cf. k'vd-om-a 'dying', sir c x v - i l - i 'shame' cf. g - r c x v - e n - i - a 'you are ashamed', s i - r b - i l - i
'running' cf. mi-rb-i-x-a+r 'you are running (thither)';
si- -ul-i: this is another old Masdar formant found still in some
substantivised forms (e.g. si-q'var-ul-i 'love' cf. m-i-qvar-x-a+r 'I love
you', si-jul+v-il-i 'hatred' cf. m-jul-x-a+r 'I hate you');
si- -o: this again forms abstract nouns from adjectives but is less106GEORGIANGRAMMARcommon than s i — e (e.g. si-t'k'b-o 'sweetness' <= t'k'b-il-i 'sweet', sitb-o 'warmth' <= tb-il-i 'warm', si-(m)sx-o 'thickness' <= m s x v - i l - i
'thick'—N.B. how all three adjectives lose the suffix -il- when the noun is
formed).
Nouns are sometimes formed by simply adding the appropriate caseending to some other part of speech. The postposition -gan governing a
plural noun (usually with the old plural ending -ta) or, as very commonly, a
plural personal pronoun regularly undergoes this derivational process, e.g.
q'vela tkven-gan-ma
all
you(PL)-from-ERGčox-eb-i
cherkesska-PL-NOMa-(Ø-)i-k'valt-o-s
PREV-(3rd.PER-)SVhitch.up-AOR.SUBJ-X'all of you are to hitch up your cherkesska(s)'
By incorporating the cardinal ert-i T into this type of expression one
is able to say 'one of X', e.g.
mt'er-i
tav-s
da-(Ø-)e-sx-a
enemy-NOM head-DAT PREV-(X-)IOV-assault-he(AOR)
ma-t-gan-s/kalak-ta-gan-s
them-GEN-from-DAT/town-GEN.PL-from-DAT
'the enemy attacked one of them/the towns'ert
onean alternative is to use ert = ert-i 'one of' as a simple adjective (e.g.
ert=ert-i u-m+nišvn+el+ovan-es-i
amocana 'one of the most
important problems').
muxl+ta+šoris-i 'inter-nodal part of a plant-stem' <= muxl-i 'knee;
leaf-node' + -ta- Genitive/Dative plural + šoris 'among, between'. This is
basically a substantivised adjective.
a+r+s-i 'creature, esšence' is simply the OldGEORGIAN3rd person
singular of the copula 'X is', which today would be a+r-i(-s), plus the
Nominative case-ending.
The same source is at the base of
a+r+s+eb+ob-a 'existence', which is Masdar of (Ø-)a+r+s+eb-ob 'you
exist'. The finite verb-form v-(Ø-)i-c-i 'I know (X)' gave rise to the
privative adjective u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant', which then became source for the
abstract noun u+v + i + c-oba 'ignorance'. We have already met the
conjunctional phrase vin+i+c+oba+a 'in case', which is the abstract noun
in—oba of the šentence vin (Ø-)i-c-i-s? 'who knows?'. The Old
GEORGIAN3rd person singular of the Prešent Indicative Passive of the verb
'read' was i-k'itx-v-i-s (today the more normal form would be i-k'itx-veb-a); this old form gives rise to the noun i+k'itx+v+i+s-i '(grammatical)NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY107reading, lectio. In OldGEORGIANthe 3rd person singular Prešent i-jvr-i-s
'X moves'8 formed the basis for the noun i-jvr-i-s-i 'snake, lizzard, reptile'
(= ModernGEORGIANkve-c'ar-ma-val-i lit. 'that which moves forward
down below', a euphemistic circumlocution for semi-taboo words like gveli 'snake').
Reduplication of roots with a change of vowel or consonant-adaptation
is a non-productive part of word-formation (e.g. abda=ubda 'nonšense',
are=mare 'surroundings').
3.9.2 Adjective-formation
Adjectives, as we have seen, may be used nominally (reduced relative
clauses), and some of the formations below may have nominal functions.
-a: added to nouns or adjective-noun phrases this indicates possession
of the relevant nominal characteristic (e.g. cal-pex-a 'one-legged' <= cal-1
'one (of two)' + pex-i 'leg' + -a, xit=xit-a 'chuckling (ADJ)' <= xit=xit-i
'chuckling (NOUN)')—if the forms appear as nouns, the Genitive is in - a s(a);
-ad-i: this suffix is simply an adjective based on the Adverbial caseending. When attached to a Masdar-base, it is the equivalent of our '-able'
(e.g. (ara-)drek'-ad-i '(un)bendable' <= drek'-a 'bending', cval+eb-ad-i
'changeable' <= cval-eb-a 'changing', žang+v-ad-i 'liable to rust' <=
žang-v-a 'rusting', gul-ad-i 'intrepid' <= gul-i 'heart'). The formation of
fractions (c'il+ob+it-i ricxv+it-i saxel-eb-i) was described in 3.9.1, but
the word for 'fraction' is c'il-ad-i <= (na+)c'il-i 'part, portion'. This word
seems to be used only as a noun, whereas at-c'il-ad-i 'decimal (fraction)'
is used either nominally (at-c'il-ad-eb-i 'decimaK fraction)s') or
adjectivally (at-c'il-ad-i ricxv-eb-i 'decimal numbers');
-ebr-i: this is simply an adjective based on adverbs formed by the
postposition -ebr suffixed to the Genitive (e.g. t'alg-is-ebr-i 'wave-like'
<= t'alga 'wave'). This is a basically adjectival suffix whose forms are used
nominally; they seem particularly common in definitions of plants (consider
the Academy Dictionary definition for c'erc'a 'Caucasian honeysuckle' =
sa+äua+1+o
averaget'an-is
bučk-i
body-GEN bush-NOMcxra+t'q'av+a-s-ebr-ta
I berian.honeysuckle-GEN-likePL.GENojax-isa
family-GEN
'an average-sized bush of the family of those like the Iberian
honeysuckle'108GEORGIANGRAMMAR-ebr-iv-i: this looks like an adjective based on an adverb in -iv, itself
attached to the postposition -ebr, but there is a problem in that no
Genitive desinence precedes the -ebr in such formations. Indeed, these
derivatives are built on forms ending in -eba, which suggests that the
correct segmentation may be -eb-r(-)iv-i, but in this case what is the
- r - ? . Examples: bun-eb(-)r(-)iv-i 'natural' <= bun(?-)eba 'nature',
sa + zog + ad+o-eb(-)r(-)iv-i 'societal' <= sa + zog + ad+o-eba 'society'.
Note also the parallel -ob(-)r(-)iv-i, though in this instance there is no
derivative in -oba to act as base (e.g. a+dg+il-ob(-)r(-)iv-i 'local' <=
a+dg+il-i 'place', na+c'il-ob(-)r(-)iv-i 'partial' <= na+c'il-i 'part', skesob(-)r(-)iv-i 'sexual' <= skes-i 'sex');
-eb-ur-i: this adjective means 'like' and is attached to a Genitive stem.
Is this the origin by syncope of the postposition -ebr 'like', or is the
development the other way with anaptyctic -u-? Examples: tav-is-ebur-i 'peculiar (= like unto itself)', which is very common in the Adverbial
tav-is-eb-ur-ad 'in X's own way' (cf. tav-is-eb-ur-eba 'peculiarity') <=
tav-i 'head; self', jač'v-is-eb-ur-i 'chain-like' <= jač'v-i 'chain', rk-iseb-ur-i 'horn-like' <= rka 'horn', cix-is-eb-ur-i 'fort-like' <= cixe 'fort',
nagm-is-eb-ur-i 'mine-like' <= nagm-i '(exploding) mine', čem-eb-ur-i
'of mine', cf. the common Adverbial of such pronominal-based forms čemeb-ur-ad 'in my way');
-el-i: a very common suffix for human ethnonyms; it is frequently used
nominally (e.g. inglis-el-i mo+mger+al-i 'English singer' vs inglis-el-i
'Englishman', kart+v-el-i 'GEORGIAN(human)', m+egr-el-i 'Mingrelian
(human)', amerik'-el-i 'American (human)'; N.B. tx-el-i 'thin' vs si-tx-e
'fluid'). Not all human ethnonyms are so formed (e.g. rus-i 'Russian
(human)', svan-i 'Svan (human)', apxaz-i 'Abxazian (human)', prang-i
'French (human)', berjen-i 'Greek (human)', somex-i 'Armenian (human)');
-eul-i: built on possessive pronominal stems or the Genitive of proper
names (including 'mother' and 'father'), the resulting adjective is often little
more than the Genitive of the (pro)nominal root. It may be thought of as
meaning 'having belonged to/deriving (sometimes inherited) from ROOT', e.g.
jm-eb-s
mam-is-eul-i
kon+eba
brother-PL-DAT father-GEN-inherited.from-AGR
property(NOM)
ga-(Ø-)u-q'v-i-a-t
PREV-(3rd.PER-)OV-divide-PERF-it-PL
'the brothers apparently divided the propery inherited from their father'
tkven-eul-i
teps'-i
ga-m-i-t'q'd-a
your(PL)-AGR plate-NOM PREV-me-OV-break-it(AOR)
'the plate you owned broke on me'NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY109Attached directly to stems it signifies 'made of' and often forms
(collective) nouns (e.g. sp'ilenj-eul-i 'made of copper' <= sp'ilenj-i
'copper', p'ur-eul-i 'grain, cereals' <= p'ur-i 'wheat; bread', marcvl-eul-i
'grain (collective)' <= marcval-i '(individual) grain'; N.B. ert-eul-i 'unit' <=
ert-i T; with other cardinals it means 'group of NUMBER' as in švid-euli 'group of 7'; there is even gir+s-eul-i 'worthy' <= gir-s 'it is worth', i.e. a
verb-form);
-ian-i: this is a very productive suffix meaning 'possessing ROOT' (e.g.
xml-ian-i 'armed with sword' <= xmal-i 'sword', or-sa+rt+ul-ian-i '2storeyed' <= or-i '2' + sa+rt+ul-i 'storey', rj-ian-i 'milky' <= rje 'milk', orc'l-ian-i 'of 2 years' <= or-i '2' + c'el-i 'year', boč'k'o-ian-i 'fibrous' <=
boč'k'o 'fibre'). Note the noun adam+ian-i 'human being';
-ier-i dissimilates to -iel-i if there is an -r- in the root. Again the
meaning of the derivative is 'possessed of ROOT' (e.g. s i n d i s - i e r - i
'honourable' <= sindis-i 'conscience', na+q'op-ier-i 'fruitful, productive' <=
na+q'op-i 'fruit, product', xorc-iel-i 'corporeal' <= xorc-i 'flesh, meat').
N.B. mšven+ier-i 'beautiful' => mšven+ivr-ad 'beautifully' (cf. sindisier-ad 'honourably'), bed+n-ier-i 'lucky' <= bed-i 'fate', gem+r-iel-i
'tasty' <= gemo 'taste';
-iv-i: this is another case of an adjective derived from an adverb, this
time in -iv (e.g. xan+grj+1-iv-i 'long-lasting' <= xan-i 'time' + grj+el-i
'long', mudm-lv-i 'permanent');
- i t - i : in this instance we have an adjective derived from the
Instrumental case in -it. All the names of the grammatical cases are so
formed inGEORGIAN,as are a number of other grammatical terms (e.g.
saxel+ob-it-i 'Nominative' <= saxel-i 'name', mi+c+em-it-i 'Dative' <=
m i - c - e m - a 'giving', na + tes + a + o b - i t - i 'Genitive' <= na + t e s + a v - i
'relation', k'itx+v-it-i 'interrogative' <= k'itx-v-a 'asking', c'ar+mat'+ebit-i 'successful' <= c'ar+mat'+eb-a 'success');
—il—i: this suffix is most widely attested as a formant for Past Participles
(4.9.5), but it is also attested in some ordinary adjectives (e.g. tb-il-i 'warm'
=> tb-il-is-i 'Tbilisi = the place of something warm', t'k'b-il-i 'sweet
(ADJ)' => t'k'b-il-eul-i 'sweet (NOUN)');
-(n)del-i/-andel-i/indel-i: these variants form adjectives from
expressions of time (e.g. šaršan-del-i 'of last year' <= šaršan 'last year',
exla-ndel-i 'of now' <= exla 'now', i+m+dro-indeH 'of that time' <= i+m
dro-s 'at that time', c'1+ev-andel-i 'of this year' <= (a+m) c'el-s/c'leul-s 'this year');
-i+ur-i: this is an adjective in -ur-i preceded by -iv (e.g. c'l-i+ur-i
'yearly' <= c'el-i 'year', c-i+ur-i 'of the sky/heaven' <= ca 'sky/heaven',
tv-i+ur-i 'monthly; (menstrual) period' <= tve 'month');110GEORGIANGRAMMAR-oden-i/-oden+a
(Genitive - o d e n + a-s(a)): this produces an
adjective attached to a Genitive-base meaning 'the size of BASE' (e.g. iot'is-oden-i gan+sxva+v+eba 'an iota's/iota-size difference', n e m s - i s oden+a č'uč'rut'ana 'a crack the size of a needle');
- o v a n - i : this is another suffix producing derivatives meaning
'possessed of ROOT' (e.g. k'ld-ovan-i 'rocky' <= k'lde 'rock', k'utx-ovani 'angular' <= k'utxe 'corner, angle', mcire+c'l-ovan-i 'of tender years' <=
mcire 'slight' + c'el-i 'year'). Note the noun xel+ovan-i 'artist' <= xel-i
'hand';
-osan-i: yet another variant for saying 'possessed of ROOT' (e.g.
p'at'i-osan-i 'honourable, respectable' <= p'at'iv-i 'honour, respect'). A
number of derivatives are used nominally (e.g. xel-osan-i 'artisan' <= xel-i
'hand', ǰvar-osan-i 'crusader' <= ǰvar-i 'cross', and of course the title of
the national epic vepx+is+t'q'a-osan-i 'he who is possessed of the skin
of a panther = The Man in the Panther-skin' <= vepx(v)-i 'panther' +
t'q'av-i 'skin, pelt');
-u: usually this privative formant is the prefixai part of a circumfix (see
below in this section), but in q'r-u 'deaf it seems to be used suffixally and
alone (cf. q'ur-i 'ear');
-ur-i dissimilates to -ul-i if there is an -r in the root. This is the
non-human equivalent for ethnonyms, but it has a wider function than this
(e.g. inglis-ur-i (jagl-i) 'English (dog)', kart-ul-i 'GEORGIAN(thing)',
amerik'-ul-i 'American (thing)', prang-ul-i 'French (thing)', berjn-ul-i
'Greek (thing)', somx-ur-i 'Armenian (thing)', bazr-ul-i 'market-' <=
bazar-i 'market', jagl-ur-i 'doggish' <= jagl-i 'dog', mama-k'ac-ur-i
'manly' <= mama 'father' + k'ac-i 'man'). We seem to have the suffix in
some nouns (e.g. určx+ul-i 'dragon');
a- —il—I: this perhaps one-time circumfix is fossilised in a few words
like the adjective a+dv+il-i 'easy', apparently built on the root -dv- 'put',
though, as this division is no longer felt, it is not always signalled
elsewhere in this book, and the noun a+dg + il-i 'place', built on the
common root -dg- 'stand';
m - -an-i: this appears to be another fossil, seen in m+suk+an-i 'fat'
(cf. ga-suk-eb-a 'fatten');
m - -ar-i dissimilates to -al-i if there is an -r- in the root. We have
already seen this as a Prešent Participle formant whose products are
substantivised as agent-nouns. It also forms regular adjectives (e.g. m did-ar-i 'rich' <= did-i 'big', m-tav-ar-i 'main' <= tav-i 'head');
me—e: in addition to forming agent-nouns from nominal roots, this is
the circumfix, as we know from 3.2.3.2, for forming ordinal numerals.
mo- -o: this is equivalent to English '-ish'. It is especially common withNON-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY111colour-terms. Note the changes in the stem in some of the examples (e.g.
mo-lurj-o 'bluish' <= lurj-i 'blue', mo-mc'van-o 'greenish' <= mc'vane
'green', mo-c'ital-o 'reddish' <= c'itel-i 'red', mo-q'vital-o 'yellowish' <=
q'vitel-i 'yellow', mo-vard+is+pr-o 'pinkish' <= vard+ts+per-i 'pink (=
rose-coloured)', m o - m c r - o 'smallish' <= m c i r e 'slight', m o - t ' k ' b - o
'sweetish' <= tVb+il-i 'sweet', mo-grj-o 'longish' <= grj+el-i 'long');
sa- -e: this suffix was prešented above as marking the place
designated for the nominal root. Such derivatives may also have adjectival
function, as when English would utilise the hyphen to mark a noun
functioning adjectivally (e.g. rje 'milk' => sa-rje+v-e k'b+il-i/jirk'val-i
'milk-tooth/gland', navt-i 'oil' => sa-navt-e 'oil-container' vs sa-navt-e
č'a 'oil-well', muraba 'jam' => sa-murab-e kila 'jam-jar', nagm-i 'mine' =>
sa-nagm-e vel-i 'mine-field'; še-vs-eb-a 'filling' => sa-vs-e 'full');
sa- -o: this is virtually synonymous with the previous circumfix in
terms of its adjective-forming function (e.g. r a z m - i 'regiment' => s a razm-o 'regimental', imed-i 'hope' => sa-imed-o 'hopeful', m+xed+ar-i
'cavalier, soldier' => s a - m + x e d + r - o 'military', xipat-i 'danger' => s a xipat-o 'dangerous', m + g l o v + iare 'mourner' => s a - m + glov + iar-o
'mourning (ADJ)', me+cn+ier-i 'scientist, scholar' => sa-me+cn + ier-o
'scientific, scholarly');
u- -o: this is the exceedingly common privative circumfix (e.g. pex-i
'leg, foot' => u-pex-o 'legless', xel-i 'hand' => u-xel-o 'handless', cf. u xel-pex-o 'without hands or legs', mze 'sun' => u-mze-o 'sunless', mank'
-i 'stain, defect' => u-mank'-o 'innocent, stainfree', xma 'voice' => u-xm-o
'voiceless', kmar-i 'husband' => u-kmr-o 'husbandless', mizez-i 'cause' =>
u-mizez-o 'without cause', bral-i 'fault' => u-bral-o 'ordinary'; N.B. the
substantivised u+dab+n+o 'wilderness' <= daba 'hamlet'); N.B. u - k m - e
'work-free, rest-', for which we also have u-km-i, though this latter more
often means 'useless, lazy';
u- -ur-i dissimilates to -ul-i if there is an -r- in the root. This is a
less frequent privative circumfix (e.g. gun+eba 'mood, disposition' => u gun-ur-i 'stupid', sa+km+e 'business, work, job' => u - s a + k m - u r - i 'idle',
g e m o 'taste' => u - g e m - u r - i 'tasteless', per-i 'colour' => u - p e r - u l - i
'colourless').
By suffixing the noun per-i 'colour' to the Genitive of an appropriate
noun one produces an adjective signifying 'NOUN-coloured' (e.g. portoxali 'orange (NOUN)' => portoxl-ls-per-i 'orange(-coloured)', ca 'sky' => cis-per-i 'azure, sky-coloured').
By suffixing either -nair-i or gvar-i to roots one produces adjectives
meaning 'ROOT-like' (e.g. mraval-nair-i/mraval-gvar-i 'multiform' <=
mraval-i 'several', sxva-nair-i/sxva-gvar-i 'different (= other-like)' <=112GEORGIANGRAMMARsxva 'other', r a - n a i r - i / r a - g v a r - i ? 'of what sort?', e r t - n a i r - i / e r t gvar-i 'alike' <= ert-i T, or-nair-i/or-gvar-i 'of 2 types' <= or-i '2',
nair=nair-i 'of varied types'). With pronouns -nair-i may be used with
possessive stems (e.g. čfem-nair-i 'like me', a+m-nair-i 'like this, such',
mag-nair-i 'like that', i+m-nair-i 'like that (yonder)'). In fact, this suffix
is today freely attached to Genitives with the expected meaning (e.g. bibliis-nair-i = bibli-is m+s+g+av+s-i 'Bible-like'). An adjective again
meaning 'ROOT-like' is produced by attaching -tan+a 9 ; it is more
restricted than the previous suffix, being used especially with pronominal
stems, which, unlike the previous case, end in the Genitival -is- (e.g. čemis-tan+a 'like me', a+m-is-tan+a 'like this', m-is-tan+a 'like X, suchlike',
tkven-is-tan+a 'like you(Pl)').
Adjectives are sometimes built on postpositional phrases (e.g. ujredšoris-i 'intercellular' <= ujred-i 'cell' + šoris 'between, among', sa+rt+ulšoris-i 'inter-storey' <= sa + rt + ul-i 'storey'; c e n t ' r - i s - k ' e n - u l - i
'centripetal' <= cent'r-i 'centre' + -k'en 'towards' + -ul-i, cent'r-i+danul-i 'centrifugal' with -i + dan 'from', c x v i r - i s - m i e r - i 'nasal (e.g.
consonant)' <= cxvir-i 'nose' + mier 'by'), šua-tan+a 'medium, average' is
simply produced by combining postposition with suffix.
There are cases where finite verb-forms have given rise to adjectives
(e.g. g+i+a 'open', which is an old stative form from the verbal root seen in
the Masdar ga-g-eb-a 'opening'; u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant' comes from v (Ø-)-i-c-i 'I know (it)' with privative prefix).
Reduplication also has a role to play.
We have already met
nair=nair-i 'of different types', and others can be formed to convey the
notion 'very/quite ADJ' (e.g. msxvil=msxvil-i 'very/quite thick'). Another
way of emphasising the extent to which a quality applies is to repeat the
positive form of the adjective, the first having -ze 'on; than' suffixed to it
(e.g. cxad-ze cxad-i(-a) '(it is) as plain as can be/totally manifest' <=
cxad-i 'clear, plain'). By reduplicating cardinals one produces distributive
numerals (e.g. or=or-i '2 each', as = as-i '100 each'). By combining
consecutive cardinals one produces the equivalent of 'x or x+1' (e.g. sami=otx-i '3 or 4'). Note mavan-i da mavan-i 'this and that' 10 (as in:

If i+m+it'om is followed by the emphatic particle k'i 'indeed' and the

5.2.2.1.4 Conditional
The regular distinction between real (or vivid, or immediate, or open) and
unreal (or vague, or remote, or closed) conditions can be drawn. They are
distinguished both by the conjunction in the protasis (viz. tu 'if' for the
former vs r o m 'if' for the latter) and by the screeves that can be
associated with these conjunctions.
5.2.2.1.4.1 Real Conditionals
The conjunction tu 'if' usually occupies the first position in the protasis,
although it may also stand after the clause's first constituent. The
appropriate non-SUBJunctive screeve is used in both protasis and apodosis,
and the order of main vs subordinate clause is free, e.g.
tu kux-s,
a+g+re+t+ve
el(+)av-s
if
thunder(PRES)i-t also
lighten(PRES)-it
'If it is thundering, it is also lightening'
tu (?Ø-)i-kux-eb-s,

if (?it-)SV-thunder-TS(FuT)-it also
(?it-)SV-lightenTS(FuT)-it
'If it thunders, it will also lighten'
A peculiarity of real future conditions is that the protasis may contain
not the anticipated Future Indicative but the Aorist Indicative, so that an
alternative to the above would be:
tu (?Ø-)i-kux-a,
a+g+re+t+ve
(?Ø-)i-el(+)v-eb-s
if (?it-)SV-thunder-it(AOR) also

However, if the Conditional is used in both protasis and apodosis, then
the equivalent of an unreal conditional is produced, even though the
conjunction remains tu, e.g.
tu (?Ø-)i-kux-eb-d-a,

unexpectedly, tu may combine with the SUBJunctive mood. This
combination does not produce an unreal condition but rather conveys the
force of 'if it transpires that...' and is often found associated with oaths
when the speaker is asserting his honesty. The Prešent SUBJunctive is used
for progressive activities in the prešent, the Aorist SUBJunctive for future
events, and the IIIrd SUBJunctive for reference to the past, e.g.

unreal conditionals are marked by the conjunction rom, which avoids first

(Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's Autobiography)148GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.3 Preverbs(zmn+is+c'in+eb+i)In origin the preverbs were independently standing adverbial elements
which indicated directionality and/or orientation (sc. movement towards or
away from the speaker). Comparison of a case like postposition -gan 'from'
vs preverb ga(n)- 'out of' reveals a clear bifurcation in the development of
one such hypothesised adverbial as it solidified in the former instance with
a noun and in the latter instance with a verb (cf. postposition -Si 'in(to)' and
preverb še- 'in(to)'). Further evidence for the original independent status
of these elements comes both from the frequent examples of so-called
tmesis in OldGEORGIANtexts and from the behaviour of some of the
preverbs in modern Svan.
The original directional-orientational force of the preverbs is
preserved when they are combined with roots expressing motion. Starting
with the two preverbs of orientation, mi- and mo-, the prešent-day list of
preverbs is as follows:
Simplex
mimoa(g)ga(n)šečaga(r)dac'a(r)da-thither
hither
up
out
in
down into
across, through
away
downComplex
mi-moa(g)-moga-moše-moča-moga(r)d-mo
c'a(r)-mo[da-mo-]N.B. the older alternative forms with bracketed material are not in free
variation with their shorter variants, and their use will be described
separately below.
We can start by illustrating their usage in association with the basic
root of motion for the Prešent Indicative—for the conjugation of this verb
see 4.10. The forms below are given with 3rd person singular subject:

X goes regularly; X goes downToday mi- indicates 'thither', which is interpreted as orientation away
from either speaker or hearer (hence the translation 'go'), whereas m o indicates 'hither', which is orientation towards either speaker or hearer (or
towards a 3rd person who is in the vicinity of speaker or hearer—hence
'come'). In OldGEORGIANmo- was associated exclusively with the speaker,
so that, whereas today one can only say šen-tan mo-di-s 'X is coming to
your place', the equivalent in OldGEORGIANwould have been šen-tan midi-s. Where a verbal root implies movement, if that root has as its
preverb mi- when the movement is towards a 3rd person indirect object,
then the preverbal slot will be taken by mo- for movement towards 1st or
2nd person (e.g. mi-v-(Ø-Ø-)e-c-i 'I gave X/them to Y/them' vs m o (Ø-)g-e-c-i = OldGEORGIANmi-(Ø-)g-e-c-i 'I gave X/them to you' vs
mo-(Ø-Ø-)gv-e-c-i 'you gave X/them to us'; mi-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)mart-e 'you
addressed yourself to X/them' vs mo-(?Ø-)g-mart-es 'they addressed
themselves to you/you(PD' vs mo-(Ø-?Ø-)m-mart-e-t 'you(Pl) addressed
yourselves to me'2Ø).
Association of the two orientational preverbs in the order given
indicates movement in both directions (i.e. 'to and fro', 'back and forth').
An example would be mi-mo-di-s tav+is otax-ši 'X is pacing back and
forth/up and down in his/her own room'. Such a coupling can often be
alternatively expressed by a special reduplication consisting of m i - plus
relevant components of the verbal complex upto (usually) the end of the
root followed by (and hyphenated if written) the same sequence but with
mo- plus all appropriate inflexional material after the root (e.g. mi-mo-ixed-av-s = mi-i-xed=mo-i-xed-av-s 'X will look this way and that' 21 ;

few examples quoted in KEGl, in the case of the basic verb of motion
reduplication with these two orientational preverbs may imply movement
over a greater distance than is achievable in a single room, e.g.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

'I kill/shall kill/killed you Pl.', where the pluraliser is part of the 2nd person
exponent from Set B, or (ii) 'we kill/shall kill/killed you', where the
pluraliser is part of the 1st person exponent from Set A, or (iii) 'we
kill/shall kill/killed you Pl"", where an expected final sequence of -t-t has
been simplified by loss of one of the dentals but it is unclear which one—in
the Prešent and Future the forms here may have as a fourth reading the
one given earlier, namely 'X kills/will kill you Pl', which arises out of the
loss of - s - from Set A when followed by -t.
There are no problems with combinations of 2nd person subject and 1st

person plural allomorphs -(a/e)n/es/nen of Set A, the forms in the last133VERBAl MORPHOlOGYrow quoted are ambiguous as the 2nd person direct object could be either
singular or plural.
This brings us to the marking of indirect objects. The Set B affixes are
again employed, except that now the alternative allomorphs for the 3rd
person come into play according to the rule prešented in 2.2.7, namely: the
base- (=historically oldest) morph h- assimilates to s- when immediately
followed by any of -c, -c', - j , -č, -č', - j , -t, -t', -d, being retained as
h - before -k, -k', -g, -q', - p ' 1 3 ; before other consonants or a vowel the
zero-allophone is used. However, if until around the 2nd World War the
allophones s-, h- were still possible between 1st person subject-marker vand the root-initial consonant (e.g. mi-v-s-c'er 'I shall write to X/them',
v-h-q'v-eb-i 'I follow X/them'), today this is in general no longer true, so
that these examples would now be rendered respectively as: mi-v-c'er,
v-q'v-eb-i. Examples are from the Future Indicative forms of the
Transitive verb 'write to' and of the Intransitive verb 'follow':

We have not yet discussed the bracketed 3rd person pluraliser from
Set B or what happens with transitive verbs when both direct and indirect
object would require a non-zero pronominal prefix within the verbal
complex, a couplingGEORGIANseems to prefer to avoid. As regards the
pluraliser, prescriptive rules require that Transitive Verbs simply never
mark the plurality of a 3rd person indirect object, which is why all forms
given above for 'write to' with 3rd person indirect object were glossed as
'to X/them'. I have come across only two examples where the plurality of a
3rd person indirect object is marked with this -t on a transitive verb; the
first is from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo (29 March 1991, p.2):

PREV-PREV-(it-)portray-AOR.SUBJ-they
wish-NOM
'the voices too to which age does not give the means to express their
wish...'
where one would have expected (Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev-s. The second is from
Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's lord of Rach'a. The verb is one of those which are
Transitive but lack a direct object, their second argument being the
indirect object, viz.
m+sm+en+el-eb-s
listener-Pl-DATžriant'el-ma
shudder-ERGda-(?Ø-Ø-)u-ar-a-t
PREV-(?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)OV-run.
through-it(AOR)-Pl'a shudder ran through the audience'
However, if the verb is a bipersonal intransitive, it is indeed possible to
mark the plurality of the 3rd person indirect object as long as the subject
of the verb is 3rd person singular, so that 'X will follow them' could be
either mi-h-q'v-eb-a or mi-h-q'v-eb-a-t. An attested example of this
feature with this very root, though with a different preverb, comes from
the text of Ivane Imnaishvili's 1971 Historical Chrestomathy of the
GEORGIANlanguage (vol 1. part 2) (p.344):VERBAl MORPHOlOGY135zog+jer

'From their own root only the Prešent Indicative (etc..) are formed for

pluraliser, a consideration of these examples reveals that it cannot simply
be the prešence vs abšence of the plural indirect object in the clause, or
whether the plural indirect object precedes or follows its verb.
More will be said when describing the formation of Series 111 for
Transitive and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general about the use
with them of the two sets of pronominal affixes, but it is appropriate to
note at this point that, since with these forms the Dative nominal functions
as subject and the Nominative as direct object, the Set B affixes reprešent
the subject, whilst the Set A affixes correlate with the direct object. As
plural 3rd person human subjects impose their plurality on the verb, in
these instances the plurality of the Dative nominal will always be marked
on the verb by the suffixal -t if the Dative noun is human and if the direct
object is 3rd person (N.B. the plurality of the Nominative nominal is just
ignored as far as verbal agreement is concerned), e.g.

child-Pl-NOMThis suggests that during the course of its historyGEORGIANhas shifted
subject-status from the Nominative to the Dative nominal for these verbforms. There are two interesting illustrations in KEGl of what is
manifestly a bivalent Intransitive verb, namely 'be born to'. The first
comes from the great 19th century writer Ilia t'avč'avadze:
si+t'q'v+a-n-i
gul-ši
m-e-bad-eb-i-an
word-Pl-NOM
heart-in
me-I OV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-Pl
'Words/Speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'
where the old plural of the (non-human) subject imposes its plurality on the
verb 16 . This contrasts with the following from Ch'avch'avadze's equally
great contemporary, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli:
šv+il-eb-i
child-Pl-NOM(Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
(3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-Srd.PER-PlVERBAl MORPHOlOGY139'Children are born to them'
where the human Nominative subject imposes no plurality on the verb,
being indicated by the Set A singular suffix -a-, whilst the Dative indirect
object has its plurality shewn by -t, just as if this were an Indirect verb,
which it palpably is not 17 . Thus, one cannot take the mere prešence of this
pluraliser with a 3rd person entity as an indicator that the 3rd person
entity in question is viewed as the subject of the verb-form.
As already stated, this pluraliser for a 3rd person Dative nominal
should, according to prescriptivists, be found only when the Nominative
nominal is itself 3rd person. Once again, however, one does come across
instances where the pluraliser appears with 1st or 2nd person Nominative
nominals. Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography furnishes the examples:

How, then, doesGEORGIANavoid having two non-zero Set B affixes
within a single verbal complex, as one would expect in the translation of
clauses like 'they give you to me'?GEORGIANavoids the difficulty by
paraphrasing one of the nominals as a 3rd person NP, which, of course,
takes a zero as its coreferential affix in the verb. The phrase in question
consists of the appropriate case of the noun tav-i 'head; self' preceded by
the possessive adjective of the paraphrased pronoun. This periphrasis then
substitutes for the direct object pronoun, e.g.
šen-i
m+s'+ob+l-eb-i

This periphrasis will even be used where the indirect object is 3rd
person, asGEORGIANseems to have a preference for interpreting a 1st or
2nd person pronominal prefix on a trivalent verb as the marker of indirect
rather than direct objecthood, e.g.
čem-i
m+š+ob+l-eb-i čem-s tav-s

(Ø-Ø-)a-bar-eb-en
(3rd.PER-her-)lV-entrust-TS-they(PRES)
'my parents are entrusting me/handing me over to the teacher'
However, where the context makes it clear which nominal is the direct
and which the indirect object, this rule may be ignored—for instance, if I
am the child, it is unlikely that my parents would be entrusting the teacher
to me, and so one might hear in place of the above čem-i m+š+ob+1-eb-i
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en, even if prescriptively this
sequence should be interpreted as though the verb were to be analysed
(Ø-)m-a-bar-eb-en with the šense 'they are entrusting X/them to me'.
KEGl provides an example of the verb 'introduce X to Y' with the
periphrastic rule observed, viz.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"

as intermediary, arbiter'; (Ø-)šiv-i 'you complain'; (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i 'you
laugh'; (Ø-)cocxl-ob 'you are alive'; (Ø-)cxovr-ob 'you live'; jov-s 'X
grazes'; c'ar+mo-eb-s 'X happens, is in progress, pursues some activity';
( Ø - ) c ' v a l - o b 'you experience real difficulty doing something';
(Ø-Ø-)c'ina + s + c'ar + me+t'q'v + e l - e b 'you prophesy X/them'. A
peculiarity of a+r+s+eb-ob-s/(+?Ø-)i-a+r+s+eb-eb-s 'X exists (will
exist)' is that Series III may be regular for the Medial type (e.g. inverted
Perfect (ma-s) (Ø-)u-a + r + s + e b - ( n - ) i - ? a ) or non-inverted of the
Intransitive Verb type with, of course, Nominative subject (e.g. with Perfect
(i+s) a+r+s+eb-ul-a).
4.7.3.1 Inceptive Forms of Medial Roots
This is a process limited by Holisky to non-derived Medials whereby a
suffixal Intransitive Verb is formed from a Medial Verb in order to signify
the start of the relevant activity. The preverb is a-, and these verb-forms
behave entirely as one would expect morpho-syntactically for an
Intransitive Verb with Nominative subject in all Series, with Series III
screeves based on the Past Participle in -eb-ul- (the usual ending for
verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb), and with the possible use of Objective
Version where appropriate. The radical stem for the inceptive is in almost
all cases precisely that taken by the Medial outside the Prešent Sub-Series.
And so, from sub-group 4 (the first of the non-derived Medial groups) the
root - s i s + i n - 'hiss' does not alter across the Series, which gives the
inceptive: (Ø-)sis+in-d-eb-i 'you start hissing' => Future a-(Ø-)sis+in-deb-i => Aorist a-(Ø-)sis+in-d-i => Aorist Subjunctive a-(Ø-)sis+in-d-e
=> Perfect a-(Ø-)sis+in-eb-ul-x-a+r => Pluperfect a-(Ø-)sis+in-eb-ul(Ø-)i-q'av-i. But the root - ž g i v - 'twitter' does alter with Prešent
(Ø-)žgiv-i and Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-žgiv+l-eb, and from this latter the
inceptive is (a-)(Ø-žgiv+l-d-eb-i 'you (will) start twittering'. Similarly weVERBAl MORPHOlOGY351have z m u - i - s 'X moos' => Future (?Ø-)i-zmu + v l - e b - s => inceptive
(a-)zmu+vl-d-eb-a. Holisky gave three roots of this sub-class where the
inceptive diverges slightly from the Future stem insofar as the inceptive
stem is taken from the Masdar (namely: (?Ø-)i-bzu+vl-eb-s 'X will buzz'
=> inceptive (a-)bzu+il-d-eb-a; (?Ø-)i-š-xu+vl-eb-s 'X will rustle' =>
inceptive ( a - ) š x u + i l - d - e b - a ; ( ? Ø - ) i - c ' u + v l - e b - s 'X will buzz' =>
inceptive (a-)c'u+il-d-eb-a).
From sub-group 5 formations are entirely regular (e.g. p'r+ial-eb-s 'X
gleams' => Future (?Ø-)i-p'r+ial-eb-s => inceptive (a-)p'r+ial-d-eb-a;
k'rt-i-s 'X shimmers' => Future ( ? Ø - ) i - k ' r t + o l - e b - s => inceptive
(a-)k'rt+ol-d-eb-a).
From sub-group 6 we have such examples as: (Ø-)k'ank'al-eb 'you
quiver' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'ank'al-eb => inceptive (a-)(Ø-)k'ank'al-deb-i (with Objective Version tval-eb-i a-g-i-k'ank'al-d-a 'your eyes
started fluttering'); (Ø-)trt-i 'you tremble' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-trt+ol-eb
=> inceptive (a-)(Ø-)trt+ol-d-eb-i). Occasionally a different preverb will
be found, as in t ' i v t ' i v - e b - s 'X floats, bobs about' => Future (?Ø-)it'ivt'iv-eb-s => inceptive (a-mo-)t'ivt'iv-d-eb-a.
In the case of sub-group 7, since these verbs indicate change of
locality by some means of movement, the inceptives occur with a variety of
preverbs, determined by the direction of the movement. Also the meaning
is not necessarily 'start to...' (e.g. gor-av-s 'X rolls' => Future (?Ø-)i-goreb-s => 'inceptive' gor-d-eb-a 'X changes location by rolling' => ga-gord-eb-a 'X will roll out' vs äe-mo-gor-d-eb-a 'X will come rolling in' vs
gada-gor-d-eb-a 'X will roll across' etc.).
For the weather-verbs of sub-group 8 Holisky quotes the inceptives: agrux + u n - d - e b - a (not in KEGl) and a - k u x - d - e b - a 'it will start
thundering', ga-tov-d-eb-a 'it will start snowing', ga-rižraž-d-eb-a
'day will break', ga-c'vim-d-eb-a 'it will start raining'.
From the residual sub-group 9 some roots form inceptives but not
always with a-, whilst others do not. Examples: dug-s 'it boils' => Future
(?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s => inceptive (a-)dug-d-eb-a; (Ø-(Ø-))pikr-ob 'you
think (something)' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-pikr-eb => inceptive (da-)(Ø-)pikrd-eb-i; (Ø-)c'ux-[x-]a+r 'you are unhappy' 92 => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-c'uxeb => inceptive (s-e-)(Ø-)c'ux-d-eb-i (N.B. the common expression,
usually with s-prefix, nu še-(Ø-)s-c'ux-d-eb-i 'don't put yourself to any
trouble (sc. over it)!').
In the case of the first two sub-groups of Medials, derived from nouns
and adjectives, Holisky argues that any inceptive formation such as
(ga-)(Ø-)me+p-d-eb-i 'you (will) become king' (cf. m e + p + e 'king',
(Ø-)me+p-ob 'you reign'), (da-)(Ø-)o]ax-d-eb-i 'you (will) start a family'352GEORGIANGRAMMAR(cf. ojax-i 'family', (Ø-)ojax-ob 'you are a family-man'), etc... are based
not on the Medial but are derived straight from the relevant root. She
points out that the preverb in such cases is usually ga- or da- (as against
a-) and that a number of such formations exist where there is no Medial
counterpart (e.g. (ga-)(Ø-)c'itl-d-eb-i 'you (will) blush' <= c'itel-i 'red',
for which there is no *(Ø-)c'itl-ob).
4.7.3.2 Semelfactives from Medial Roots
With Medials of sub-group 4 (and 9) it is often possible to employ a
preverb (predominantly da-) in the typically perfective screeves to
indicate that the action is a one-off, punctual occurrence (sometimes
virtually inceptive). No other changes to the structure of the basic Medial
form usually occur, though in the case of some verb-forms, such as da-(ØØ-)i-šipčip-eb 'you will say something with a lisp', KEGl gives the
Perfect with Thematic Suffix -eb-, as in da-g-i-čipčip-eb-i-a (rather
than the otherwise expected da-g-i-čipčip-(n-)i-a); further examples
are mo-g-i-bodiš-eb-i-a 'you have said sorry' vs g-i-bodiš-n-i-a 'you
have offered apologies', and the (usually negated) verb ar ga-(Ø-?Ø-)ič'ač'an-eb 'you will not put in an appearance somewhere' from the Medial
ara+vin č'ač'an-eb-s 'there is no-one' (as in this example from the
fairytale irm+isa:

č'ianč'vela-s
and
root-DAT
ant-DAT
'in my domain through fear of me no bird has been able to put in an
appearance in the sky and down below no ant'),
though for this verb KEGl also allows Series III for this verb-form to be
formed without the Thematic Suffix. Examples: da-(?Ø-)i-q'ep-eb-s 'X
will give a bark'; da-(?Ø-)i-q'rant'al-eb-s '(eagle) will let out a screech';
da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-čurčul-eb 'you will say something in a whisper'; da-(?Ø-)ičxav+1-eb-s '(cat/jay) will let out a caw'; da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-gr+ial-eb 'you
will let out a roar'; da-(?Ø-)i-q'iv+l-eb-s '(cock) will give a crow'; da(Ø-Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will utter something, start speaking'; da-(Ø?Ø-)i-kvit+in-eb 'you will give a sob'; da-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you will shed
a tear over X/them', from which the passive (da-)(Ø-)i-t'ir-eb-i 'you areVERBAl MORPHOlOGY353(will be) wept over' is derived (Aorist da-(Ø-)i-t'ir-e, Perfect da-t'ir-ebul-x-a+r); ca da-(?Ø-)i-kux-eb-s 'the sky will issue a clap of thunder'.
From Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography we have two examples on the
same page which make it difficult to explain why one occurrence should
have the preverbal semelfactive, whilst the other has merely the basic
Medial. Consider: 'da-(ø-)gv-i-xšen-i-t a+m jagl-eb-isa-gan-o,' da(Ø-)i-q'vir-a bat'on-ma ""Save us from these dogs,' yelled the master' vs
ert-ma azna+ur-ma (Ø-)i-q'vir-a: 'vai+me, c'viv-i, c'viv-i mo-(ØØ-)m-t'ex-e!' 'one nobleman yelled: 'Oh dear, my shin, you've broken my
shin!'.'
Occasionally some other preverb is used in this function, especially with
verbs of sub-group 7, where it is the change of location that is underlined.
Examples: a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-gmin-eb 'you will give a deep sigh'; ša-(Ø?Ø-)i-seirn-eb 'you will take a walk down' vs čem-tan še-mo-(Ø?Ø-)i-seirn-eb 'you will take a walk (and call) in on me'; gada-(?Ø-)igr+ial-eb-s 'X will rumble across'; š(?Ø-)i-navard-eb-s 'X will romp
in'; ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-sr+ial-eb 'you will slip out'; ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-kr+ol-eb 'you
will fly out'.
From sub-group 9 we have: gada-(Ø-?Ø-)i-pikr-eb 'you will change
your mind/have a re-think'; mo-(?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb-en = mo-(?Ø-)isa+ub+r-eb-en = mo-(?Ø-)i-tatbir-eb-en 'they will have negotiations';
ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-tamaš-eb may mean 'you will start playing' as a synonym for
a-(Ø-)tamaš-d-eb-i, but with the structure ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-tamas'-eb it
means 'you will take X/them along playing' (e.g. ga-(Ø-)i-tamaš-es cxeneb-i 'they took the horses along in play') => Perfect ga-g-i-tamaš-eb-ia/ga-g-i-tamaš-(n-)i-a; gada-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will speak
loud enough to make yourself heard' (the Perfect is given by KEGl as
gada-g-i-lap'arak'-n-i-a) vs ča-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will speak
softly' (with the Perfect given as ča-g-i-lap'arak'-(eb-)i-a).
From Vazha Pshavela's The Roe-Deer Fawn's Tale' we have gada(?Ø-)i-kux-a 'the thunder passed over = ceased' (cf. c'vim+a-m gada(?Ø-)i-g-o 'the rain passed over = ceased').
A few Medials can form perfective screeves as if they were simple
Transitive Verbs, which is to say by the addition of a preverb to the basic
Medial form of the Prešent Indicative. It is important to note that such
verb-forms are treated transitively by virtue of taking an Ergative subject
in Series II and undergoing inversion in Series III. Examples: jagl-i da(?Ø-)q'ep-s 'the dog will give a bark' => Aorist jagl-ma da-(?Ø-)q'ep-a
=> Perfect jagl-s da-(Ø-)u-q'ep-i-?a; m o - t o v - s 'there will be a fall of
snow'; mo-c'vim-s 'there will be a fall of rain'.
Particularly interesting here are a number of verb-forms quoted in354GEORGI AN GRAMMARKEGl with a variety of preverbs, added to the basic Medial in the Future.
With še- as an example, the citation-forms (always with 3rd person
subject) shew the Future and Aorist Indicatives containing a 3rd person
indirect object prefix, even though there seems to be no necessity of there
being an indirect object external to the verb and the gloss relates them
always to the non-relative type of semelfactive with which we began this
sub-section; the Perfect is just like the basic Medial with preverb. But in
addition these verb-forms stand alongside cognates where š is added to
the Prešent of the basic Medial. This does not perfectivise the Medial but
is a way of associating an indirect object with it, meaning 'address some
comment to someone using a particular voice-quality'. The Future SubSeries and Series 11 screeves are then homonymous with the semelfactives
just described, but in Series 111 the forms with indirect object incorporate
the Thematic Suffix -eb. For example, semelfactive še-(Ø-)h-bgav+leb-s 'X will bleat something out/start bleating' is glossed as da-(?Ø-)ibgav+1-eb-s and has the Aorist š ( Ø - ) h - b g a v + l - a and Perfect š e (Ø-)u-bgav+l-i-a (e.g. 'datv-i-o!' a+m da+q'vir+eb+a-ze datv-rna-c
še-(Ø-)h-bgav+l-a
'vai+me-o!' 'at this cry of 'bear!' the bear too
bleated out 'gracious!""), but alongside it we find: Prešent še-(?Ø-)h-bgavi-s 'X bleats out (Y) at Z/them' => Future š ( Ø - ) h - b g a v + l - e b - s => Aorist
še-(Ø-)h-bgav+l-a => Perfect še-(Ø-)u-bgav+l-eb-i-a -tvis. Similar
pairings are: š ( Ø - Ø - ) h - q ' v i r - e b 'you will yell out something/start
yelling' (Perfect še-g-i-q'vir-(?n-)i-a) vs š(Ø-?Ø-)h-q'vir-i 'you yell
out (X) to Y/them' (Perfect še-g-i-q'vir-eb-i-a -tvis); še-(Ø-Ø-)s-)axeb 'you will shout something out/start shouting' (Perfect š g - i - ) a x (?n-)i-a) vs še-(Ø-?Ø-)s-)ax-i 'you shout out (X) to Y/them' (Perfect šeg-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis); še-(?Ø-)h-q'mu+vl-eb-s 'X will start howling'
(Perfect še-(Ø-)u-q'mu+vl-i-?a) vs še-(Ø-)h-q'mu-i-s 'X howls out (Y)
to Z/them' (Perfect š(Ø-)u-q'mu+vl-eb-i-a); še-(?Ø-)h-q'iv+l-eb-s
'X will start crowing' (Perfect še-(Ø-)u-q'iv+l-i-?a) vs še-(Ø-)h-q'iv-i-s
'X crows out (Y) to Z/them' (Perfect še-(Ø-)u-q'iv+l-eb-i-a); še-(?Ø-)hbzu+vl-eb-s 'X will start buzzing' (Perfect še-(Ø-)u-bzu+vl-i-?a) vs še(Ø-)h-bzu-i-s 'X buzzes out (Y) to Z/them' (Perfect š(Ø-)u-bzu+vl-ebi-a). In the case of the stem -čiv+1- 'complain', although both paradigms
are prešented, there seems no difference in meaning, viz. še-(Ø-Ø-)s-čivi 'you share your sorrow X with Y/them' => Future še-(Ø-Ø-)s-čiv+l-eb
=> Aorist še-(Ø-Ø-)s-čiv+l-e => Perfect 3e-g-i-čiv+l-(?n-)i-a/še-g-ičiv+1-eb-i-a -tvis. For še-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ir-i (Perfect še-g-i-t'ir-eb-i-a
-tvis) the only meaning given is 'confide sorrow X in Y/them tearfully'.
For še-(Ø-Ø-)s-čurčul-eb it is stated that the form only exists in the
Prešent Sub-Series with the meaning 'whisper something to someone' and isVERBAl MORPHOlOGY355thus synonymous with (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-čurčul-eb 'you (will) whisper X/them to
Y/them', which has a full paradigm of screeves (Perfect g - i - š u r š u l (?n-)i-a -tvis). And for š ( ? Ø - ) h - q ' e p - s (Perfect še-(Ø-)u-q'ep(?n-)i-?a) the only meanings offered are 'give a bark' and 'start barking at
someone'. KEGl quotes related examples for other preverbs such as
gada-, gad-mo-, še-mo-, though without the thoroughgoing prešentation
of minimal pairs in terms of either meaning or diversity in the formation of
Series III—for example, 'X will yell out over yonder to someone' is given
as gada-(?Ø-)h-q'vir-eb-s with (bracketed!) Perfect gada-(Ø-)u-q'virn-i-a m-is-tvis, whilst the same verb-form but with hither-orientation is
given as gad-mo-(?Ø-)h-q'vir-eb-s with (unbracketed!) Perfect gadmo-(Ø-)u-q'vir-eb-i-a, whereas 'shout a caw over in this direction' is
given as gad-mo-(?Ø-)s-čxav+l-eb-s with alternative Perfects gadmo-(Ø-)u-čxav+l-(eb-)i-a!
For other means of associating indirect objects with Medials see 4.7.3.5.
4.7.3.3 Medials with Preverbs in the Prešent Sub-Series
For Medials of sub-group 7 it is possible to add any of the three preverbs
mo- vs mi- vs da- to specify that the motion is taking place, respectively,
'hither (i.e. towards speaker/addressee)', 'thither' or 'around'.
Most
commentators also allow such associations with members of sub-group 4,
though Holisky queries this freedom—there are also examples for roots of
the Residual class. Examples: mo-k'unt'ruš-eb-s 'X comes frolicking' vs
mi-k'unt'ruš-eb-s 'X goes frolicking' vs da-k'unt'ruš-eb-s 'X frolics
around'; mo-cuncul-eb-s 'X comes scuttling' vs mi-cuncul-eb-s 'X goes
scuttling' vs da-cuncul-eb-s 'X scuttles around'; mo-grut'+un-eb-s 'X
comes grunting' vs mi-grut'+un-eb-s 'X goes grunting' vs da-grut'+uneb-s 'X goes around grunting'; mo-q'rant'al-eb-s 'it flies hither cawing'
vs mi-q'rant'al-eb-s 'it flies thither cawing' vs da-q'rant'al-eb-s 'it
flies around cawing'; da-čurčul-eb-s 'X goes around whispering'; dagr+ial-eb-s 'X goes around roaring'; mo-xox-av-s 'X comes crawling';
da-cur-av-s 'X swims around' 93 ; da-tamaš-ob-s 'X goes around playing';
da-gor-av-s 'X rolls around'; mo-t'ir-i-s 'X comes crying' vs mi-t'ir-i-s
'X goes crying'; da-laslas-eb-s 'X shuffles around'; da-lac'lac'-eb-s 'X
wanders around hungry'; da-laq'+un-eb-s = da-xet'+ial-eb-s 9 4 ' X
aimlessly goes around'; da-t'r+ial-eb-s 'X rushes around'. In addition to
these three preverbs we find such examples as the following: (čančker-i)
gada-kux-s '(waterfall) passes over thunderingly'; (c'q'aro) gad-mošxu-i-s = gad-mo-čkep-s '(spring) comes bubbling through'.
It is often possible, especially with roots indicating a sound, to
associate indirect objects with these verb-forms; in these cases da- seems356GEORGIANGRAMMARregularly to have its original force of 'down (over)'. Examples: d a (Ø-)grut'+un-eb-s/da-(Ø-)gru(5+un-eb-s
(deda goč'-eb-s) '(the
mother) grunts down over (the piglets)'; da-h-gr+ial-eb-s 'X roars down
over Y/them'; da-h-kvit+in-eb-s 'X sobs over Y/them'; mo-s-t'ir-i-s 'X
comes following Y/them crying' vs mi-s-t'ir-i-s 'X goes following Y/them
crying' vs da-s-t'ir-i-s 9 5 'X stands crying over Y/them'; da-s-čurčuleb-s 'X whispers over Y/them'; da-(Ø-)el + v+ar-eb-s 'it lightens over
X/them'; da-s-t'r+ial-eb-s 'X rushes around over Y/them'; da-s-tamašeb-s 'X plays around/over Y/them' 9 6 . Note too g a d - m o - s - č k e p - s 'X
comes bubbling out over X/them'. In some cases the association of the
indirect object in this manner is not restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series
(e.g. an eagle screeching down over someone is indicated by PrešentFuture da-(?Ø-)h-q'rant'al-eb-s => Aorist da-(?Ø-)h-q'rant'al-a =>
Perfect da-(Ø-)u-q'rant'al-(?n-)i-a -ze; (da-)(?Ø-)h-q'ep-s/(da-)
(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'ep-s 'X starts (will start) 97 barking (Y) at Z/them' => Aorist
da-(?Ø-)h-q'ep-a/da-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'ep-a => Perfect da-(Ø-)u-q'ep-(?n-)
i-?a -tvis; da-(?Ø-)h-q'iv-i-s 'X crows (Y) at Z/them' => Future da(?Ø-)h-q'iv+l-eb-s => Aorist da-(?Ø-)h-q'iv+l-a=> Perfect da-(Ø-)uq'iv+l-(?n-)i-?a -tvis; da-(?Ø-)s-čxav-i-s 'X caws (Y) at Z/them' =>
Future da-(?Ø-)s-šxav+l-eb-s => Aorist da-(?Ø-)s-čxav+l-a=> Perfect
da-(Ø-)u-čxav+l-(?n-)i-?a -tvis).
4.7.3.4 Preverbal Medials marking the moderate application of the verbal
activity
The addition of c'a- to basic Mediais in perfective screeves indicates that
the action is carried out to a small degree only. By my reckoning, KEGl
quotes circa 6Ø such verb-forms 98 . It prešents a further 5Ø or so verbforms where the preverb c'a-mo- is coupled to a basic Medial in the
perfective screeves; some of these are glossed in the same way as for
c'a-, namely 'X will VERB a little', but the majority seem to indicate a swift,
sudden (perhaps somewhat rude?) action on the part of the subject. For
c'a- we have examples like: c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-varjiš-eb 'you will take a bit
of exercise'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-gund-av-eb 'you will have a bit of a snowball
fight'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-vaxšm-eb 'you will have a light dinner'; c'a-(Ø?Ø-)i-zarmac-eb 'you will be a little lazy'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-tamaš-eb 'you
will play for a bit'; c'a/c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will mutter to
yourself'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-brdgv-en 'you will roar a bit'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)ime+cad+in-eb 'you will do a bit of studying'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-muSa-v-eb
'you will do a bit of work'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-mger-eb 'you will sing for a
while'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-mo+tk+m-eb 'you will do a spot of lamenting'; c'a(Ø-?Ø-)i-p'ur+maril-eb = c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-keip-eb 'you will have a bit ofVERBAl MORPHOlOGY357a feast'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you will have a little cry'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)it'rabax-eb 'you will boast a bit'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-pšut'+un-eb = c'a-(Ø?Ø-)i-kš-en 'you will give out a little whistling gasp'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)ičipčip-eb 'you will utter something with a bit of a lisp'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)ičurčul-eb 'you will utter something in a bit of a whisper'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)ixlič+in-eb 'you will utter something a bit hoarsely'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xumreb 'you will have a bit of a joke'.
With indirect object we have formally prefixal bipersonal Intransitive
Verbs, such as: c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you will play with X/them a
little' (Perfect c'a-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r); c'a-g-e-mat'-eb-a 'a
little will be added to you' (Perfect c'a-g-mat'-eb-i-a); c'a-(Ø-Ø-)exumr-eb-i 'you will joke a little with X/them' (Perfect c'a-(Ø-Ø-)xumreb-i-x-a+r); c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you will start talking to
X/them who are close to you'.
One then finds such colloquialisms in the Prešent Sub-Series only as:
c'a-(?Ø-)i-boršč-eb-s 'it somewhat resembles borshch', c'a-(?Ø-)ik'oč'l-eb-s = mo-(?Ø-)i-k'oč""l-eb-s 'X limps a bit'; c'a-(?Ø-)itav+xed-eb-s 'X is somewhat arrogant'.
For c'a-mo- we have examples like: c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you
will start to cry/have a little cry'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-bod-eb 'you will
mumble something incoherently in your sleep'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-gmin-eb
'you will suddenly moan something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-zmu+vl-eb 'you will
suddenly howl something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-k'nav+l-eb 'you will suddenly
mew/utter mewingly'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'rut'+un-eb 'you will suddenly
utter something with a purr'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'ik't'ik'-eb 'you will
suddenly blurt something out'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-(p)s'mu+vl-eb 'you will
suddenly gasp something out'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'bed-eb = c'a-mo-(ØØ-)roš-av = c ' a - m o - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - q ' r a n t ' a l - e b 'you will suddenly

When c'a-mo- replaces the normal preverbs (da-/mo-/mi-) for the

light rain', but for 'raining' either a parallel form is possibe, viz. c'a-moc'vim-s 'there will be a drop of rain', or both versioniser and Thematic

"16GEORGI AN GRAMMARComparing this non-finite form with the finite v-i-q'av-i 'I was' vs i-q'+o
<= earlier i-q'v-a 'X was', we see that the root is -q'((a)v)- (with v marking 1st person subject, (-)i- an old passive marker 6 , -i an Indicative
exponent for the Aorist tense, and -a/+o the indicator of a 3rd person
singular subject). Readers will see that I have glossed the old passive
marker with such (Series 11 ) forms of the copula as the Subjective Version
vowel, even though, rather arbitrarily, I have glossed what in origin was
the same i-vowel in the Future Sub-Series forms of the copula, which
derive from an old passive of another root meaning 'do, make' (namely
-k(m)n-), as the Passive marker. What then in the Masdar are the
components - o p - and - n - ? An equals-sign (=) is used either where the
script would itself employ a hyphen or to indicate reduplication. A
question-mark applied to a whole word raises doubts as the
acceptability/existence of that word; when applied to an agreement-affix
within a verb, it questions either the presence of that (zero-)affix or
uncertainty as to the implied referent.
The provenance of some examples is stated, but mostly no such source
is quoted. A large number of citations are taken from the illustrative
material in KEGL; most of the rest have been noted by me over the years
from my general reading of, and/or listening to, Georgian; occasionally
simple sentences were made up by myself.
Readers cannot fail to notice the imbalance in the length of the
chapters, with Chapter 4 on verbal morphology representing more than all
the other chapters put together. This is a natural consequence of the fact
that the chief difficulty (and, to the linguist, greatest attraction) of
Georgian resides in the wonderful complexity of the verbal system. I have
endeavoured to give too much rather than too little information on the
various conjugational patterns (to such an extent that I suspect some may
accuse me of unnecessary spoon-feeding). However, as the verb is the
essence of this language, I felt it was important that readers new to the
language should be able to turn up immediately any particular 'screeve' (=
tense-, mood- or aspect-paradigm) and see how any individual sub-class of
verb conjugates therein. I have also tried to give as much guidance as I
could to help readers see and understand the many highways and byways
traversed by individual verb-roots.","[34, 35]"
"3Non-verbal Morphology3.0 Structure of the chapter
The non-verbal parts of speech will be described in the following order:
Nouns, Adjectives (including numerals), Adverbs, Postpositions, Pronouns,
Particles, Conjunctions, Interjections, Derivational Morphology, and
Acronyms.
3.1 Nouns (a+r+s+eb+it-isaxel-eb-i)Essentially only one declensional pattern, distinguishing seven cases, exists
for all nouns in Georgian, but there are slight variations depending on
whether the noun-stem ends in a consonant or a vowel—for the use of the
cases see 5.1.1. And so, this natural division is followed in the following
presentation. As regards the plural-formation, the normal strategy is to
employ the pluralising suffix -eb-, to which the same case-endings are
then attached as are found in the singular. However, the usual formation
for the plural in Old Georgian was different: distinct markers existed for
the Nominative and Vocative cases, whilst representation of the remaining
(oblique) cases was subsumed under a single portmanteau morph. This
older pattern is still found in higher, archaising styles as well as in some
set-expressions today, and it was indeed quite common in literature until
well into the 20th century. Naturally, both formations are signalled below.
3.1.1 Consonant-final noun-stems
The declension of a typical consonant-final noun k'ac-i 'man' is set out,
followed by necessary comments.
The thorough-going agglutination of the modern declensional pattern
was matched only in the Nominative and Vocative of Old Georgian, where,
however, the plural morpheme had a different morphic exponent; in the
oblique cases Old Georgian employed only the synthetic -t(a), which is but
rarely attested, if at all, in the Instrumental and Adverbial cases.","[50, 51, 52]"

'when my friend introduced us to each other..'.
A subtle interplay between affixal marking and preverb sometimes
becomes relevant in such cases. In the non-Prešent Sub-Series the verb
'entrust' can take either mo- or mi-, the former when the verbal activity is
directed towards either 1st or 2nd person (or, more rarely, a 3rd person if
that 3rd person is in the vicinity of either speaker or addressee), whilst the
latter implies an action aimed away from speaker or addressee. This
means that, when prešented with a form like mimabareben, the listener
knows that the 1st person agreement-affix cannot be signalling an indirect
object, as motion towards 1st person would necessitate the preverb mo-.
Hence, this verb-form will be analysed as mi-m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en 'they
will entrust me to X/them', making the periphrasis unnecessary. On the
other hand, momabareben can only be analysed as mo-(Ø-)m-a-bareb-en 'they will entrust X/them to me'.
The esšentials of cross-referencing within the verb of upto three
external arguments have now been explained. More will be said at the
appropriate places about the specifics of Series 111 forms for Transitive
and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general. This section closes
with some further examples of agreement-patterns for different types of
Transitive and Intransitive verb-forms in Series I and II—try to spot just

commentators as Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers, are
elements, consisting in all cases but one of the structure VC, which attach
directly to a root (or root + Causative-marker, or root + passive/inceptive
marker -d-) for all screeves in Series I. Since the Perfect of Transitives
is formed on the Prešent stem, most Transitives keep their Thematic Suffix
also in the Perfect. The verbal noun (Masdar) and participles for most
verbs also incorporate the relevant Thematic Suffix (in some cases in a
reduced guise), and, since Series III for monopersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Past Participle whilst that for bipersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Masdar, Thematic Suffixes are widely attested in Series
III for Intransitive (including Indirect and Stative) verbs. Two of the
Thematic Suffixes (with exceptions) even occur in Series 11. For these
reasons I judge the alternative names given above for these formants too
restrictive.
The Thematic Suffixes in use today with Transitive Verbs are: -eb,
-ob, -av, -am, -ev, -en, and -i. Those in this list are widely used; in
addition one can point to: (a) -em, found in parts of the paradigm for the
root 'give' (viz. Future mi-(0-0-)s-c-em PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)3rd.PERgive-TS(FUT) 'you will give X/them to Y/them' vs the equivalent Aorist mi(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i PREV-(you-3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)IOV-give-AORJNDIC
'you
gave X/them to Y/them'); (b) -op, found with the root for 'divide' (viz. ga(Ø-Ø-)q'-op PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)divide-TS(FUT) 'you will divide X/them'
vs Aorist ga-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i 'you divided X/them')—this suffix also turns up
in part of the paradigm of the copula (e.g. the past participle q'-op-il-i
'having been, ex-' and the masdar q'-op-n-a 'being').
Whilst theGEORGIANmasdar does not normally distinguish active
(transitive) from passive (intransitive), there are a number of roots which
do possess their own passive/intransitive masdars. In these masdars one
finds the element -om occupying the slot normally taken by the Thematic
Suffix (i.e. between root and masdar-exponent -a). Consider the following:
(a-)(Ø-)dg-eb-i 'you (will) stand up' => vs a-dg-om-a 'standing up' (cf.
dg-om-a 'standing'), (mo-)(Ø-)k'vd-eb-i 'you (will) die' => (mo-)k'vd-oma 'dying'18, (Ø-)xt'-i 'you jump' => xt'-om-a 'jumping', (ga-)t'q'd-eb-a 'X
(will) break(s)' => (ga-)t'q'd-om-a 'breaking (intrans.)' vs (ga-)(0-0-)t'ex
'you (will) break X/them' => (ga-)t'ex-a 'breaking (trans.)', (mo-)(0-0-)axd-en 'you (will) effect X/them' => (mo-)xd-en-a 'effecting' vs (mo-)xdeb-a 'it (will) happen(s)' => (mo-)xd-om-a 'happening'. With this last it is
interesting to compare the verb-form ( g a - ) ( 0 - 0 - 0 - ) x d - i (N.B. the144GEORGIANGRAMMARdifferent Thematic Suffix as well as the structural analysis) (Prev-)(you3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)strip-TS 'you (will) remove article(s) of clothing X from
Y/them', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-a 'undressing', whereas we have
the intransitive form (ga-)(Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you (will) become X; you (will)
grow thin', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-om-a. However, for the
former meaning of this verb-form there exists the transitive (ga-)(00 - ) x d - i 'you (will) render X/them Y' (e.g. u+en+o-s
ga-g-xd-i-s
speechless-DAT PREV-you-render-X(FUT) 'X will render you speechless').
Yet it would seem that in this instance the Masdar in -om is also used
transitively—KEGl quotes this example for C'avč'avadze:
še+i+jl+eb+a st'umar-i jm-ad
mi-(Ø-)i-tvis-o-s

'It's possible for a man to accept a guest as a brother, but, as for
making him (his) master, he will die and (still) not deign to do this'
In the case of šr-om-a the word is viewed today more as an abstractnoun 'work(ing)' than as the Masdar of (Ø-Ø-)š'vr-eb-i 'you do X'.
There are a few verbs that employ in places the seeming Thematic
Suffix -ol (e.g. kar-i kr-i-s 'the wind blows' => kr-ol-a 'blowing' and cf.
the Future kar-i i-kr-ol-eb-s 'the wind will blow'; g-q'+av-s 'you have
animate X/them' => q'-ol-a 'having (something animate)' and cf. the Future
g-e-q'-ol-eb-a 'you will have animate X/them'; (Ø-Ø-)i-svr-i 'you hurl
X/them' => sr-ol-a 'throwing' and cf. the Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sr-ol-eb 'you
will hurl X/them'; (da-)(Ø-)c'v-eb-i 'you (will) lie down' => da-c'-ol-a
'lying down' (cf. c'-ol-a 'lying')).
Another suffix that might be regarded as (at least akin to) a Thematic
Suffix is -il, but this too today has more of the force of an abstract-noun
formant—it is particularly common with Stative verbs, and sometimes it
combines with the prefix si- (e.g. tav-i g-t'k'iv-a head-NOM you-pain-it
'your head aches' => t'k'iv-il-i '(being in) pain', (Ø-)dum-x-a+r yoube.silent-you-be 'you are silent' => dum-il-i '(being in) silence', (Ø-)k'vdeb-i 'you die' => si-k'vd-il-i 'death', (Ø-)i-rb-en 'you will run' => either
si-rb-il-i or rb-en-a 1 9 , g-ši-a 'you are hungry' => ši-mš-il-i <= *si-msil-i, for the bilabial nasal cf. mš-ier-i 'hungry' and (Ø-Ø-)a-mš-ev 'youVERBAl MORPHOlOGY145make X/them hungry'). In a few verbs the suffix -il seems to correlate
with -in in other parts of the paradigm (e.g. j(-)il-i 'sleep' vs g-j(-)inav-s 'you are asleep', korc'(-)il-i 'wedding-feast' vs da-korc'(-)in-dnen 'they got married' and gan-korc'(-)in-d-nen 'they got divorced').
The Thematic Suffix -i is clearly the exception in terms of its
structure, as well as being the one which is not carried over into the
Perfect. However, at first glance it may seem that this latter statement is
not correct (cf. ga-g-zrd-i-s PREV-you-rear-TS-X
'X will rear you',
which gives the Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-zrd-i-x-a+r 'X apparently (has) reared
you', where we still have an i-vowel immediately after the root. However,
this is no longer the Thematic Suffix but a Perfect-exponent, as we see if
we take any Transitive Perfect formed from roots coupled either with no
Thematic Suffix or any Thematic Suffix other than -av or -am in Series I
(e.g. for the Root Verb (da-)(0-0-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' we have
the Perfect da-g-i-c'er-i-a 'you apparently wrote/have written X/them',
whilst for (ga-)(0-0-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' we have the
Perfect ga-g-i-k'et-eb-i-a 'you apparently (have) made X/them').
Of the Thematic Suffixes listed above -eb, or, more restrictedly, -ob
and -ev are also found in Series I screeves as part of the morphology of
Intransitive verbs—as indeed is the bilabial element of -am and the labio­
dental for some verbs in -av.
As to the original function of the Thematic Suffixes, the best
explanation so far advanced is that of Aronson (1979). To anticipate what
is made explicit in Chapter 5, a comparison of the syntax of Transitive and
Intransitive verbal classes for Series I screeves reveals that we are
dealing with a Nominative-Accusative configuration (the Nominative case
marks the subject of both Transitive and Intransitive Verbs, whilst the
direct object is marked differently, viz. by the Dative case). In Series II,
however, we have an Ergative-Absolutive alignment (transitive subjects
standing in the Ergative case, whilst intransitive subjects and direct objects
stand in the Nominative(-Absolutive)). The Dative case is, of course, also
used to mark the indirect object with the majority of finite verb-forms, and
the at first glance surprising fact that the Dative also marks the direct
object for Transitive Verbs in Series I screeves could be straightforwardly
explained, if in origin the relevant argument functioned as an indirect
object of what at the time would have been a bivalent intransitive verbform. Aronson illustrated an instance in OldGEORGIANwhere what today
would be regarded as a simple Dative direct object was evidently
interpreted as an indirect object thereby occasioning the Set B agreementprefix s- in the verb-form (namely:146GEORGI AN GRAMMARs-cv-i-d-es
3rd.PER-defend-3rd.PER-I MPERF-they
'they were defending the gates')i+gi-n-i
that-Pl-NOMbč'e-ta
gate-Pl(DAT)Taking, as commentators generally do, Series 11 with its ergativealignment to be basic in the language, Aronson suggested that what today
are clearly independently existing Series I transitive screeves with their
own restructured tense, and aspectual (sc. imperfective vs perfective)
oppositions (not to mention the active-passive dichotomy) were in origin all
derived intransitive, imperfective forms produced from the fundamental,
ergatively aligned Series 11 base-forms by an anti-passive transformation,
whose morphological markers were none other than today's Thematic
Suffixes. Series I direct objects were, thus, in origin indirect objects and
were naturally marked by the Dative; this case has simply continued to
mark the relevant entity, now reinterpreted as a direct object.
A given root will normally be used for a given meaning always with the
same Thematic Suffix, even though it sometimes happens that dialects
employ for a given root a Thematic Suffix different from the one generally
in use, and Root Verbs are sometimes assigned a Thematic Suffix, often
-av (e.g. for (Ø-Ø-)t'ex 'you break X/them' one may meet (Ø-Ø-)t'exav). However, we have already given one example where the suffix -av
was replaced by -eb when an indirect object governed by the locative
Versional vowel a- was associated with the root in question. Two parallel
examples would be (še-)(0-0-)k'er-av (PREV-)(you-3rd.PER-)sew-TS 'you

"496GEORGIANGRAMMAR'Speak' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root -brjan- when used transitively (again without preverb) means
'speak' or 'issue an instruction'. Examples: ra-s (Ø-Ø-)brjan-eb-t? 'what
are you saying?', (Ø-Ø-)brjan-e, äen-i xmal-i da čem-i k'iser-il
literally 'Speak, your sword and my neck' = 'Say what you want, I am yours
to command', sardal-ma (Ø-Ø-)brjan-a še+t'+ev+a-ze gada-svl-a
'the general ordered the going over to the attack'. When endowed with the
Objective Version, we get (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-brjan-eb 'you (will) give X/them
command Y',
'Say to'
Regardless of subject the usual verb for 'say to' can give way for reasons
of politeness to mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xs+en-eb 'you (will) say X/them to
Y/them'278 (e.g. mag-is še+sa+x+eb vera+per-s mo-(Ø-)g-a-xs+eneb-t for (Ø-)g-e-t'q'v-i-t 'I shall be unable to tell you anything about
that', did madl+oba-s mo-(Ø-)g-a-xs+en-eb-t for (mo-i-(Ø-)g-i-xdi-t 'I (shall) give you great thanks'). The Masdar mo-xs+en-eb-a may be
used as '(academic) talk, paper', with the Active Participle m o - m - x s + e n eb-el-i (with syncopating suffixal vowel) '(academic) speaker'. Without
preverb (Ø-Ø-)a-xs+en-eb is 'you (will) mention X/them' (Past Participle =
xs+en-eb-ul-i/na-xs+en-eb-i).
'Know' (2nd person subject)
In place of the direct statement tkven (Ø-Ø-)i-c-i-t 'you ERG(Pl.) know
something' we have the more polite Indirect Verb tkven mo-g-e-xs+eneb-a-t, where tkven is notionally Dative.
'Want' (2nd person subject)
In place of the direct g-i-nd-a-t 'you want X/them' (an Indirect Verb) we
regularly find the root -neb- especially in such expressions as ra g-nebav-t? 'what do you want?', ro+gor+c g-neb-av-t 'as you wish' (again
Indirect). The Transitive form of the root ((Ø-Ø-)i-neb-eb 'you (will)
conceive a desire for X/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-neb-e, Perfect g-i-nebeb-i-a) is itself a polite alternative to (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-nd + o m - e b =
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-sur+v-eb; it is especially common as the translationequivalent of 'please help yourself/yourselves' when offering a guest food
or drink, namely (Ø-Ø-)i-neb-e-t, with its own polite synonym in mi-(ØØ-)i-rtv-i-t—cf. (mi-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rtm-ev 'you (will) hand X/them to

As stated earlier, the usual formation of the passive/intransitive form
for verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb and containing a vowel in the root is to
employ the suffix -d-. However, when a passive/intransitive is produced
from a causative, the formation is of the prefixal type. Some monopersonal
intransitives produced from Causatives, which are restricted to the Prešent
Sub-Series, may be bivalent (i.e. deponents) (e.g. xel-eb-s (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'vrev + i n - e b - i 'you flail (your) arms around', which is more or less
synonymous with the passive/intransitive Causatives (Ø-)i-rt'q'-m-ev+ineb-i and (Ø-)i-cem-in-eb-i 'you hit out'). Where the prefixal formation
is bipersonal, the meaning is regularly (sc. insofar as these forms can be
considered regular) 'get oneself VERBed by XI O'. where one could, of
course, use the equivalent active voice Transitive in association with the
appropriate reflexive. Consider the following examples (from Shanidze
1973.362): mgel-s (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)e-t'ac-eb-in-eb-i = mgel-s (ga-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-t'ac-eb-in-eb (àen-s) tavs 'you (will) have yourself snatched
away by the wolf' => Aorist mgel-s (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)e-t'ac-eb-in-e = mgel-s
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'ac-eb-in-e (äen-i) tavl => Perfect mgel-s (ga-)

(šen-s) tav-s 'you (will) allow X/them to hit you' (see under Root Verbs
below); (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)e-kVl-ev+in-eb-i = (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'vl-ev+ineb (šen-s) tav-s 'you (will) allow X/them to kill you'; (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-trev-in-eb-i = (mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-tr-ev-in-eb (šen-s) tav-s 'you (will)

'you (will) allow X/them to curse you'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)e-šv-eb-in-eb-i =
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-šv-eb-in-eb (šen-s) tav-s 'you (will) get X/them toVERBAl MORPHOlOGY411release you'.
In the case of uc'in čven a+m+den-i ar gv-e-xd-ev+in-eb-od-a
'in the past we were not made to pay so much as this' we have the true
passive of uc'in čven a+m+den-s ar
(Ø-)gv-a-xd-ev+in-eb-d-nen
'previously they used not to make us pay so much as this'.
Thematic Suffix -eb
The Thematic Suffix is retained, to which is suffixed -in-, as in: (ga-)(ØØ-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb-ineb 'you (will) get X/them to do/make Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-šv-eb
'you (will) release X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-šv-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to release Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb 'you (will) learn/understand
something' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
learn/understand something'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c , q , -eb 'you (will) begin
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'q'-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to begin
Y/them'; N.B. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-vic , q , -eb 'you (will) put X/them out of your
mind' => (da-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-vic'q'-eb(-in-eb) 'you (will) get X/them to
forget Y/them'; N.B. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-ma+xs+ov+r-eb 'you (will) recall
X/them to mind' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-ma+xs+ov+r-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to recall Y/them to mind'.
The verb for 'locating' (viz. (mi-/mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-eb 'you (will)
locate X/them') is a verb with Thematic Suffix -eb but (prescriptively at
least) with the peculiarity that it is construed with a subject and indirect
object of the entity located. We have seen, however, that there are
examples where the construction is regularised to conform with that of a
normal Transitive Verb with subject and direct object of the entity located.
Morphologically the Causative is entirely regular, producing (mi-/mo-)(ØØ-Ø-)a-gn-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to locate Y/them'. However,
syntactically this Causative seems to behave as though its b a š v e r b were
just like any normal Transitive Verb (ignoring, in other words, the
prescriptive construction for the bašverb)—for the syntax of Causatives
see 5.1.8. Consider the strange example in KEGl from the 19th century
writer C'avč'avadze: zog+ad mizez-s mi-(?Ø-?Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a
i+m gare+mo+eba-m 'that circumstance permitted us to find the general
cause', where we expect either the prescriptive zog+ad-i mizez-is-tvis
mi-(?Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a or the 'regularised' zog+ad-i mizez-i mi(Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a.
Root Verbs
The suffix -in- is attached directly to the root, which never alters shape,
as in: (da-)(Ø-Ø-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'er-412GEORGIANGRAMMARin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to write Y/them'; (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-)s-c,er
'you (will) write X/them to Y/them' => (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c,er-in-eb (tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to write Y/them (to Z/them)'; (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)zel
'you (will) knead X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-zel-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to knead Y/them'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-č'er 'you (will) catch X/them' =>
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'er-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to catch Y/them'; gag-a-kv-s/ga-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an 'you (will) take inanimate X/them out' =>
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'an-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to take inanimate
Y/them out';
še-mo-g-q,+av-s/s'e-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q,van
'you (will) bring
animate X/them in' => (šmo-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'van-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to bring animate Y/them in'.
I n the case of (Ø-Ø-)č' 'you (will) eat X/them' we have the old suffix
-ev retained to give (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'm-ev 'you (will) get X/them to eat
Y/them = feed Y/them to X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'am-e, Perfect g-ič'm-ev-i-a -tvis). This can itself be causativised to give (Ø-Ø-Ø-)ač'm-ev-in-eb (-tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to feed Y/them (to Z/them)'.
The verb for 'hitting' (viz. (Ø-?Ø-)s-cem 'you (will) hit X/them') is a Root
Verb of which the same can be said as for (mi-/mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-eb
'you (will) locate X/them' above. Morphologically the Causative is entirely
regular, producing (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to hit
Y/them'. However, syntactically this Causative seems to behave as though
its b a š v e r b were just like any normal Transitive Verb (ignoring, in other
words, the prescriptive construction for the b a š v e r b ) . Consider the
examples in KEGl: the first is again from C'avč'avadze: i+k-a-mdisa mi(Ø-?Ø-?Ø-)u-šv-i mt'er-i, rom (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-e mama beber-i
'you gave the enemy his head to such a pitch that you allowed him to strike
the old father' (where the prescriptive construction would strictly require
...(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-e ma-s mam-is-tvis); the second is from Kiačeli:
tav-i ro+gor v-(Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-o? 'how should I allow X/them to hit
me?' (instead of the prescriptive tav-is-tvis ro+gor v-(?Ø-Ø-)a-cemin-o ma-s/ma-t?). The Causative of this verb is also used in the
following, difficult-to-analyse expression cxvir-s (?Ø-?Ø-)g-a-cem-ineb-s 'you sneeze' (e.g. p'et're burnut-s (Ø-)?s-c'-ev-s da p'avle-s
cxvir-s (?Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-cem-in-eb-s 'Peter inhales snuff and Paul
sneezes').
Thematic Suffix -en
The Thematic Suffix is retained unchanged, to which -in- is suffixed, as in:
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-rč-en 'you (will) heal X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rč-enin-eb 'you (will) help X/them to heal Y/them'; (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)(a-)p-en
'you (will) exhibit X/them' => (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-p-en-in-eb 'you (will)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY413get X/them to exhibit Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-cd-en 'you (will) miss [= fail
to attendj X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-cd-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them
to miss [= fail to attendj Y/them'; (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-sm-en 'you (will) listen to
inanimate X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sm-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them
to listen to inanimate Y/them'.
Thematic Suffix -ev
The Thematic Suffix is retained unchanged, to which -in- is suffixed, as in:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-ngr-ev 'you (will) ruin X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-ngrev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to ruin Y/them'; da-(Ø-Ø-)l-ev 'you will
drink X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
drink Y/them'; ( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) a - n j g r - e v 'you (will) shake X/them' =>
(še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-njgr-ev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to shake Y/them';
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-rc'-ev 'you (will) rock X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rc'-evin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to rock Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)?s-c'-ev 'you
(will) pull/move along/draw/drag X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'-ev-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to pull/move along/draw/drag Y/them'; ( m i - / š ) ( Ø Ø-Ø-)a-šv-ev 'you (will) accustom X/them to Y/them' => (mi-/še-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-čv-ev-in-eb (-tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to accustom Y/them (to
Z/them)' (for an example of this verb in a Series III screeve see 5.1.8.1.3).
The verb for 'giving' in the Prešent Sub-Series is of this type, and from (ØØ-Ø-)a-)l-ev 'you give X/them to Y/them' we form the entirely regular
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)l-ev-in-eb (-tvis) 'you get X/them to give Y/them (to
Z/them)'163. Though KEGl quotes Series 11 and 111 forms for this verbform (just, indeed, as it quotes for the b a š v e r b an Aorist Indicative (ØØ-Ø-)jl-i-e and Perfect g-i-)l-ev-i-a (-tvis)), outside the Prešent SubSeries it is normal to base the Causative on the suppletive root seen in the
Future (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-)s-c-em 'you will give X/them to Y/them' to
produce the entirely regular (mi-/mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c-em-in-eb (-tvis)
'you will get X/them give Y/them (to Z/them)'.
Thematic Suffix -av
The Thematic Suffix reduces to -v-, tucking itself inside the root, if the
root ends in one of the sonants -1/n/r, if the root ends in -v, one of the
two now contiguous labio-dentals disappears. If the root contains a vowel,
only the suffix - i n - is attached, whereas the longer -ev+in- is used for
roots lacking a vowel, as in: (da-)(Ø-Ø-)mal-av 'you (will) hide X/them' =>
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-mal-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to hide Y/them';
(ga-)(Ø-Ø-)č'im-av 'you (will) stretch X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'imv-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to stretch Y/them'; (gada-)(Ø-Ø-)q'lap'av 'you (will) swallow X/them' => (gada-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'lap'-v-in-eb 'you414GEORGIANGRAMMAR(will) get X/them to swallow Y/them'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)k'arg-av 'you (will) lose
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'arg-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to lose
Y/them' [N.B. sometimes the Objective Version of the non-Causative is used
as an alternative to the Causative, as in: javr-i ra+m i+s+e (Ø-)a-c'uxeb-s, rom mada da-(Ø-Ø-)u-k'arg-o-s 'some annoyance is making X
so unhappy as to cause X to lose appetite' = ...mada da-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'argv - i n - o - s ; a+m
ambav-ma
sruli+ad
da-(Ø-)m-i-k'arg-a
mo+tm+in+eba 'this news made me lose patience completely' = ...da(Ø-)m-a-k'arg-v-in-aj; (da-i-(Ø-Ø-)rg-av 'you (will) plant X/them' =>
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rg-v-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to plant Y/them';
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)c'v-av 'you (will) burn X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to burn Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)sxl-av 'you
(will) prune X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sxvl-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to prune Y/them'; (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)xn-av 'you (will) plough X/them' =>
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvn-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to plough Y/them';
(da-)(Ø-Ø-?Ø-)u-k'r-av 'you (will) play instrument X' => (da-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-kVr-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to play instrument X'.
For the notion 'cause to see, shew' the Causative is based on the
perfective root -nax-, and there is a choice between the anticipated
(da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nax-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to see/notice
Y/them' (cf. (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nax-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
preserve/keep Y/them') and (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nax-v-eb 'you (will) get X/them
to see Y/them'. Note the bipersonal Intransitive derivative of this latter:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-nax-v-eb-i 'you (will) shew yourself to X/them' (=> Aorist
da-(Ø-Ø-)e-nax-v-e => Perfect da-(Ø-Ø-)nax-v-(eb-)i-x-a+r), as, for
example, in the colloquialisms: u+k'et+es-i k'ac-is tval-s ara (Ø-)enax-v-eb-a ra 'nothing better can be seen by the eye of man', and, in the
Prešent Sub-Series only: tb+il+is-i g-e-nax-v-eb-a-t 'you(Pl.) will have
seen Tbilisi'.
Thematic Suffix -i
The Thematic Suffix is lost. If there is a vowel in the root, only -in- is
suffixed, whereas -ev+in- is used where there is no vowel in the root, as
in: ( g a - ( m o - ) ) ( Ø - Ø - ) ( a - ) g z a v n - i 'you (will) šend X/them' => (ga(mo-))(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-gzavn-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to šend Y/them';
(gada-)(Ø-Ø-)targmn-i 'you (will) translate X/them' => (gada-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-targmn-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to translate Y/them'; (ga-)(ØØ-)zrd-i 'you (will) rear X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-zrd-ev+in-eb 'you
(will) get X/them to rear Y/them'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)gl-i 'you (will) exhaust
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-gl-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to exhaust
Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)č'r-i 'you (will) cut X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-čr-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY415ev+in-eb 'you (WILL)GETX/them to cut Y/them'.
Though the verb for 'selling' has Thematic Suffix -i (viz. (ga-)(ØØ-)q'id-i 'you (will) sell X/them'), its Masdar takes a v-element as though
the Thematic Suffix were -av. This same element appears in the Causative
to give (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'id-v-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to sell
Y/them'—cf. (mo-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-q'id-v-in-eb (čem-tvis) 'you (will) get
X/them to sell Y/them (to me)' and (mi-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'id-v-in-eb (m-istvis) 'you (will) get X/them to sell Y/them (to Z)'. Without preverb the
meaning is 'you (will) get X/them to buy Y/them' from (Ø-Ø-)q'id-ulobAØ-Ø-)i-q'id-i 'you (will) buy X/them'.
Thematic Suffix -ob
The Thematic Suffix is retained, and - i n - alone is suffixed to it, as in:
(da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-xrc--ob 'you (will) asphyxiate X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)axrč-ob-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to asphyxiate Y/them'; (mo-)(ØØ-)sp'-ob 'you (will) destroy X/them' => (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sp'-ob-in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to destroy Y/them'; (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-)r-ob 'you (will)
dislodge X/them (upwards)' => (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)r-ob-in-eb 'you (will)
get X/them to dislodge Y/them (upwards)', e.g.
e + s xmal-i
this sword-NOMa-mo-(Ø-Ø-)m-a-)r-ob-in-e
PREV-PREV-(you-it-)me-lV-move-TS-CAuSA O R . I N D I C ( = I MPER)kv-i+dan
stone-from
'allow me to dislodge this sword from the stone'
For the root cf. jr+av+a 'engine', (da-)(Ø-Ø-)(?s-)jr-av 'you (will) set
X/them in motion', which is virtually synonymous with the Inceptive
Causative (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mo+jr+av-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start
moving' based on the Inceptive (a-)mo+jr+av-d-eb-i 'you (will) start
moving' from the simple Medial
(Ø-)mo+jr+a-ob/(Ø-?Ø-)i-mo+jr+av-eb
'you (will) move' from the adjective mo+jr+av-i (k'ibe)
'moving
(stairway)'.
Thematic Suffix -am
The Thematic Suffix reduces to -m (thereby causing any root-final -v to
be lost); the suffix -ev+in- is then added, as in: (da-)(Ø-Ø-(?Ø-))a-b-am
'you (will) bind X/them (?to Y/them)' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-b-m-ev+in-eb
'you (will) get X/them to bind Y/them'; (ča-XØ-Ø-)i-cv-am 'you (will) don
X/them' (Perfect ča-g-i-cv-am-s) => (ča-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c-m-ev+in-eb416GEORGIANGRAMMAR'you (will) get X/them to don Y/them' 164 ; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)sv-am 'you (will) seat
X' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)s-m-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to seat Y' vs
(da-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-sx-am 'you (will) seat them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sx-mev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to seat them'.
We also have (Ø-Ø-)sv-am in the šense of 'you drink X'. Whilst the
Causative 'getting X to drink' is usually based on the perfective root of
'drink' (viz. - 1 - plus Thematic Suffix -ev), this non-perfective may also
provide the base for an old Causative derivation still in possible use to give
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev 'you (will) get X/them to drink Y/them' (=> Aorist (ØØ-Ø-)a-sv-i, Perfect g-i-s-m-ev-i-a -tvis); KEGl also quotes a
preverbal form in še- with the meaning 'get someone to swallow a liquid;
make someone drink something'. According to Tschenkčli (1958.I.338) the
Causative in -ev may itself be causativised to give (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-evin-eb (-tvis) 'you (will) get X/them to give Y/them as a drink (to Z/them)',
but KEGl quotes such a verb-form only as (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev-ineb 'you (will) get X/them to put stamp/frank/brand Y somewhere (= -ze)'
(Causative of (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sv-am 'you (will) put stamp X on Y') or as
(c'a-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to smear X/them
(on Y/them = -ze)' (Causative of (c'a-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-sv-am 'you (will)
smear/rub X/them on Y/them'). For 'slurping = drinking noisily' we have the
Root Verbs (še-)(Ø-Ø-)xvrep' = (še-)(Ø-Ø-)xvret', and for these the
Causative is simply (and irregularly) (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvrep' = (še-)(Ø-ØØ-)a-xvret',
N.B. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-tk-m-ev+in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to say Y/them'
(with preverb gada- the meaning would be 'gainsay'; with ga-mo- it is
'make express'; with c'ar-mo- it would be 'make declare').
Thematic Suffix -opThe Thematic Suffix is retained, and -in- alone is suffixed, as in: (ga-)(ØØ-)q'-op 'you (will) split X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'-op-in-eb 'you
(will) get X/them to split Y/them'.
Consideration of the above-forms in comparison with the formation of
Masdars (see 4.9.1) reveals that the stem for the Causative is what is left of
the Masdar after removal of the final -a Masdar-exponent.
4.8.1 An Old Causative Formant?
The regular Causative marker in Svan is -un-/-wn-, and there are a few
verbs containing such an element inGEORGIAN,which are best explained by
assigning the relevant morph an original causative-function. Consider:
(šXØ-Ø-la-)rc'-un-eb 'you (will) make X/them shudder' vs (še-)(Ø-)VERBAl MORPHOlOGY417jrc'-un-d-eb-i 'you (will) start to shudder' from (Ø-)jrc'-i 'you shudder'
(Imperfect (Ø-)jrc'-od-i), which is limited to the Prešent Sub-Series and
has the Masdar jrc'-ol-a or j r c ' - u n - v - a ; tav-s
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)im+k'vd+ar-un-eb 'you (will) pretend to be dead' from m+k'vd+ar-i
'dead'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-tb-un-eb 'you (will) cover all round and thus keep
X/them warm' from (ga-)(Ø-)tb-eb-i 'you (will) get warm'; (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)acx-un-eb 'you (will) give out heat' from (ga-)cx+el-d-eb-a 'it gets (will
get) hot'; (da-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-rc'm-un-eb 'you (will) convince X/them (of Y =
-ši)' from g-(r)c'am-s 'you believe X/them'. From the root seen in (Ø-)
xt'-i 'you are jumping' and (Ø-)xt'-eb-i 'you jump (in some direction)' we
have two Medial near-synonyms of (Ø-)xt'-i, namely (Ø-)xt'-un-av 'you
jump on the spot' (=> Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'-un-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'un-e, Perfect g-i-xt'-un-i-a) and (Ø-)xt'-un+a-ob 'you jump around' (=>
Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'-un-av-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xt'-un-av-e =>
Perfect g-i-xt'-un-av-i-a). In turn we have the Causatives meaning 'you
(will) get X/them to jump about': (Ø-Ø-)a-xt'-un-eb (=> Aorist (Ø-Ø-)axt'-un-e => Perfect g-i-xt'-un-eb-i-a) and (Ø-Ø-)a-xt'-un-av-eb (=>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)a-xt'-un-av-e => Perfect g-i-xt'-un-av-eb-i-a).
4.8.2 The Causative for Medial Verbs
The Causative of Medials is simply the b a š f o r m with a-versioniser which
in its Subjective Version provides the Medial with its Future Sub-Series and
Series 11 screeves (Series 111 then being formed, as one would expect from
these, esšentially Transitive Verb-forms, by inversion and other
appropriate adaptations). Such (pseudo-)Causatives share with the Medial
the feature that even in the normally perfective screeves no preverb is
used. And so, we have such correspondence-sets as the following:
(Ø-)cek'v-av 'you dance' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-cek , v-eb vs (Ø-Ø-)acek'v-eb 'you (will) get X/them to dance'; (Ø-)t'ir-i 'you cry' => Future

Future (?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s vs (rje-s) (Ø-Ø-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) boil (the418GEORGIANGRAMMARmilk)'. In Series III, whilst the Medials incorporate no Thematic Suffix -eb
but often do insert the element -n-, the corresponding (pseudo-)Causatives
do incorporate the Thematic Suffix -eb and form the three screeves of
this Series as one would expect—for example: Perfect cecxl-i g-iguzguz-eb-i-a 'you apparently made the fire crackle/roar' vs Pluperfect
cecxl-i g-e-guzguz-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive cecxl-i g-eguzguz-eb-in-o-s. Note how screeves differ for the verbs 'learn' and
'teach': (Ø-(Ø-))sc'avl-ob 'you learn (X/them)' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avli165 => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl-i-a => Pluperfect ge - s c ' a v l - a => III rd Subjunctive g - e - s c ' a v l - o - s vs ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a sc'avl-i 'you (will) teach X/them to Y/them' 1 6 6 => Aorist ( Ø - Ø Ø-)a-sc'avl-e => Perfect g-i-sc'avl-eb-i-a -tvis => Pluperfect g - e sc'avl-eb-in-a -tvis => III rd Subjunctive g-e-sc'avl-eb-in-o-s -tvis;
in the perfective screeves of both 'learn' and 'teach' either of the preverbs
š e - / d a - may in fact be used, presumably when the nuance is of a full
acquisition of knowledge.
From (Ø-Ø-)xmar-ob 'you use X/them' (Future (Ø-Ø-)i-xmar-eb; cf.
(da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xmar-eb-i 'you (will) help X/them' 1 6 7 ) we have
(da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xmar(-eb) 'you (will) use X/themDO for the
benefit of/to assist Y/themI O', where we note the optionality of employing
the Thematic Suffix -eb in Series I (cf. the synonyms (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø(Ø-Ø-)švel-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i
'you (will) aid
Ø-)a-švel-eb from
X/them' and (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-s'vel-eb-i 'you (will) come/go to the
assistance of X/them'). Cf. (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-švel+i-eb = (da-)(Ø-Ø-)ixmar-eb 'you (will) bring in X/them in aid; make advantageous use of
X/them'.
There are, however, some exceptions to this, as shewn by the following:
(Ø-Ø-)varaud-ob 'you suppose X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-varaud-eb vs
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-varaud-eb-in-eb 'you (will) cause X/them to suppose

without direct object see 5.1.8.1.2.
4.8.2.1 The Causative of Inceptives Derived from Medials
Inceptive derivatives from Medials, which are formally suffixal Intransitive
Verbs, utilise a preverb (often a-) in the perfective screeves. By adding
this (or the relevant) preverb to a Medial's (pseudo-)Causative we produce
the Inceptive Causative, as in: (Ø-)tamaš--ob/(Ø-?Ø-)i-tamaš-eb 'you
(will) play' => (Ø-Ø-)a-tamaš-eb 'you (will) get X/them to play' vs
(še-i-(Ø-)tamaš'-d-eb-i 'you (will) start to play' => (še-i-(Ø-Ø-)a-tamas'-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY421eb 'you (will) get X/them to start to play'; (Ø-)t'ir-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you

X/them to start to cry'; (Ø-)mger-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-mger-eb 'you (will) sing' =>
(Ø-Ø-)a-mger-eb 'you (will) get X/them to sing' vs (a-)(Ø-)mger-deb-i 'you (will) start to sing' => (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-mger-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to start to sing'; dug-s/(?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s 'X boils/will boil' => (ØØ-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) boil X/them' vs (a-)dug-d-eb-a 'X starts (will
start) to boil' => (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-dug-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start to boil'.
4.8.2.2 The Causative of Semelfactives Derived from Medials
The use of a preverb in the perfective screeves with a basically Medial
verb-form indicates a one-off, semelfactive occurrence of the verbal
action. By using that preverb with the Medial's (pseudo-)Causative we
causativise the semelfactive, as in:
(Ø-)q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-q,vir-eb
'you
(will) yell' => (Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you (will) get X/them to yell' vs da-(Ø-?
Ø-)i-q'vir-eb 'you will let out a yell' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you (will)
get X/them to let out a yell'.
(Ø-)suntk-av/(Ø-?Ø-)i-suntk-eb
'you
(will) breathe' => (Ø-Ø-)a-suntk-eb 'you (will) get X/them to breath' vs (am o - ) ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - s u n t k - e b 'you (will) breathe out' => (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)as u n t k - e b 'you (will) get X/them to breathe out', for which the full
Causative (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-suntk-eb-in-eb (or even (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)asuntk-v-in-eb) may serve as synonym, ara+vin
č'aš'an-eb-s/(?Ø-)ič ' a č ' a n - e b - s 'no-one is/will be somewhere' => ara+vi-s
(Ø-Ø-)aš'ač'an-eb 'you (will) allow no-one to be somewhere' vs ara+vin ga(?Ø-)i-č""ač'an-eb-s 'no-one will put in an appearance somewhere' =>
ara+vi-s ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-č'ač'an-eb 'you (will) allow no-one to put in an
appearance somewhere'.
These examples are not easy to find, for with a number of verbs there
seems to be no great difference between the expected semelfactive
meaning resulting from coupling a preverb with the Medial verb-form and
an inceptive šense. For example, there is no formal inceptive cognate for
(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you (will) laugh', but the preverbal ga(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb is glossed by KEGl as 'you will start to laugh', and so
the corresponding (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-cin-eb is glossed as 'you will cause
X/them to laugh, bring laughter to X/them, get X/them to burst out
laughing' (vs (Ø-Ø-)a-cin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to laugh'). In the case
of ( Ø - ( Ø - ) ) l a p , a r a k , - o b / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - l a p , a r a k , - e b 'you (will) speak
(something)' we do have a formal inceptive (namely (a-)(Ø-)lap'arak'-deb-i 'you (will) start to speak') to which the Causative is (a-)(Ø-Ø-)alap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start speaking'. In contrast we422GEORGIANGRAMMARhave the formal semelfactive da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap , arak'-eb, but this is
glossed in virtually the same way as a-(Ø-)lap'arak'-d-eb-i, namely
'begin speaking, give voice, say something, start into speech'. However, the
formally equivalent Causative is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb, which is
glossed as: 'you (will) give someone the opportunity to speak, get someone
to give voice, allow someone to speak with someone' (e.g. ar-c k'i da(Ø-)a-lap'arak'-a 'X didn't even allow Y/them to speak', which, however,
is possibly better interpreted semelfactively as 'didn't allow the saying of
even a word' than inceptively as 'didn't allow to start speaking'). Similarly
for one of the examples in KEGl, namely:
ro+gor ga-(?Ø-)i-xar-eb-d-a,
rom

PREV-(?3rd.PER-)SV-speak-TS-IMPERF-FuT.SuBJ-he
'how X would rejoice if the sick person were to become conscious, were
to speak'
where 'speak' does not necessarily mean 'start to speak' but rather 'say just
a little (sc. in order to shew that the power of speech has returned)', but
perhaps we are here being overly precious in trying to detect semantic
subtleties.
4.9 Non-finite Forms of the Verb (zmn-is ara=pinit , +ur-i pormeb-i)
The non-finite forms we shall be examining are: (i) the verbal noun (or
Masdar), (ii) the Active (sometimes called Prešent) Participle, (iii) the Future
Participle, (iv) the Privative Participle, (v) the Past Participle. Not every
root will necessarily possess each of these forms. Version (with one
possible exception) has no role to play in non-finite forms, and no
agreement-markers occur here either. The non-finite forms of Irregular
Verbs are given together with all the other information about them in 4.1Ø.
The general description of, and relevant comments about, the four
participles will be prešented in sub-sections 4.9.2-4.9.5, which last sub­
section will then include particular details as they relate to the different
sub-types of verb and exemplification for all four participles of the
selected verbal roots, each selection beginning with the Masdar.","[428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441]"

"NON-VERBALMORPHOLOGY813.5.4 Negative (uar+q'+op+it-i) Pronouns
Depending on whether one wants the neutral, potential or prohibitional
pronouns one has a respective choice of ara-vin, vera-vin, nura-vin
for 'no-one', or again for 'no longer anybody' the choice is a-gara-vin,
ve-gara-vin, nu-gara-vin; the declensions follow that of vin? above.
The parallel choices for 'nothing'/'no longer anything' are ara-per-i/agara-per-i, vera-per-i/ve-gara-per-i, nura-per-i/nu-gara-per-i
respectively; these decline like any syncopating consonant-final noun.
An older alternative to ara-per-i is ara-ra, or just ara. An example
of this last would be: ara-s (= ara-per-s (ar)) v-i-t'q'v-i 'I shall say
nothing'. The longer of the alternatives is today usually only found when
its constituent parts are split by the verb, as in the traditional start to
fairy-tales (viz. i-q'+o da ara i-q'+o ra 'there was and there was
nothing' = 'once upon a time'). For the potential equivalent vera in the
phrase vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you won't be able to achieve
anything' cf. mag kad+il-it vera-s ga-(Ø-?Ø-)xd-eb-i-t, bič'-eb-o
'with that impudence you won't manage to achieve anything, lads'.
3.5.5 Indefinite (gan+u+sa+zgv+r+el+ob+it-i) Pronouns
Indefinite pronouns exist with the suffixes - m e for non-specific
indefiniteness and -ga+c for specific indefiniteness; they are based on the
human and non-human interrogative pronouns. The basic (and easiest)
declension-pattern fuses the particle to the root and then adds the casedesinence, but alternatives are available. We start with vin-me 'anyone':

3.5.6 Relative (mi+mart+eb+it-i) Pronouns
The relative pronouns are produced by suffixing -c to the appropriate
interrogative pronoun with the relevant case-endings. The relative
pronouns are: v i n - c 'who', r a - c 'which', r o m e l - i - c 'who, which',
ra+m+den-i-c 'as many as', ro+gor-i-c/ra+nair-i-c/ra+gvar-i-c 'of
which type'. Any clitic postposition will precede the suffix (e.g. v - i s tvisa-c 'for whom'); when the postposition is -ze, it may expand to -zeda
(e.g. romel-ze(da)-c 'on which'); when it is -ši, it may expand to -ái(d)a
(e.g. ra-ái((d)a)-c 'in which'). When the relative pronoun is accompanied84GEORGI AN GRAMMARby a free-standing postposition or, if Genitive, by a head-noun, the suffix
will either attach to the final word of the phrase in which the relative
pronoun stands or will be absent, e.g.

The noun tav-i 'head' serves as reflexive pronoun. It is either used by
itself, e.g.

3.5.8 Emphatic (xaz+ga+sm+it-i) Pronouns
The indeclinable emphatic pronoun is t(v)+it+on 'self'; variants are the
shorter tv+it (in origin a syncopated variant of the Instrumental of tav-i
'head; self) or tav+ad (the Adverbial of tav-i 'head; self). Standing quite
alone the emphatic pronoun may function as either aNOMINATIVEor
Ergative case; otherwise it stands alongside the case-form of the word it
emphasises (e.g. t(v)+it+on/tv+it/tav+ad c'a-vid-a 'X(NOm) went

3.5.9 Reciprocal (urt+i+ert+ob+it-i) Pronouns
The two pronouns are ert+man+et-i and ert+i+me+or+e 'each other,
one another'. Although the analysis of both is transparent, the first
containing the cardinal '1' in the Ergative case (= -man-) followed by an
abbreviated form of itself, the second containing theNOMINATIVEform of
the same cardinal followed by the ordinal '2nd', the pronouns behave like
unanalysable wholes and serve as objects, changing for case accordingly
like normal consonant-final and vowel-final nouns respectively, e.g.

3.5.10 Possessive (k'utvn+il+eb+it-i) Pronouns
Essentially there is a unified pattern that is followed in the formation of
every type of possessive pronoun: take the Genitive of the relevant
pronoun, treat this as the stem for the possessive, and simply add the
appropriate case-ending to this new stem to suit the context—in the
NOMINATIVE such forms are ambiguous, being either the possessive pronoun
or the equivalent possessive adjective. The Dative, however, usually ends
in -a-s (often used in the sense of 'at so-&-so's place'). According to
Tschenkéli, there is no Genitive case, but I give what would surely be such
a Genitive below in the conviction that, if one needed to make one of these
pronouns the object of the Genitive-taking verb 'fear', one could have
recourse to just such forms. Let us take as the starting illustration the
reflexive possessive tav-is-i 'one's own' vs tav+ian-t-i 'their own'—N.B.

3.6. Particles'each(na+c'il+ak'-eb-i)3.6.1 Interrogative Particles
Though OldGEORGIANformed 'Yes-No' questions by means of the clitic
particles -a and -me, the modern literary language does not (cf. 5.1.13.1),
though some mountain-dialects still employ -a.
Leading questions expecting the answer 'yes' contain xom, those
expecting the answer 'no' contain xom ar/ver (cf. 5.1.13.4).
An element of surprise is introduced into a question by means of either
of the particles gana or nu+tu (cf. 5.1.13.5).
We have seen the particle -ga used with interrogative pronouns to
lend them the nuance of 'pray, on earth' (cf. 3.5.3). Less restrictedly such a
nuance can be provided by such particles as gana,
nu+tu,
vi+to+m/mitam, net'a(v(i)), e.g.
gana ra

net'a vin i-q'+o i+s gogo?
'Who pray was that girl?'
For the conjunctional role of vi+to+m see 5.2.2.3.2.
3.6.2 Conjoining Particles
The clitic particle -c(a) 'too, also' is used; when attached to a word ending
in a consonant, it must be preceded by the vowel -a-, e.g.
mankana-c
ga-v-(Ø-)t'ex-e
car(NOM)-too PREV-I -(it-)smash-AOR
'I smashed the car too'89NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYWhen used in the way just illustrated, it can be substituted by
a+g+re+t+ve 'also' (e.g. a+g+re+t+ve mankana ga-v-(Ø-)t'ex-e). In a
series of conjuncts, the clitic may be attached to each (functioning as
equivalent to 'both...and') and accompanied by the conjunction da 'and', e.g.
p'arask'ev-sa-c tov-d-a
da k'vira-sa-c
Friday-DAT-too
snow-I mPERF-it and Sunday-DAT-too
'it snowed on both Friday and Sunday'
The sequence -c k'i is the equivalent of 'even', e.g.
u+bral+o

3.6.3 Indefinite Particles
The use of the non-specific -me and the specific indefinite -ga+c in the
formation of indefinite pronouns was described in 3.5.5.
3.6.4 Speech Particles
The analysis and function of the three particles -me+tk+i, -tko/-tkv-a,
-o are presented in 5.2.2.3.1.2.
3.6.5 Response Particles
Affirmative replies are indicated by diax, k'i, ho 'yes' (most formal,
neutral, least formal respectively). Negative responses are shewn by ara
'no' or vera 'no (Potential)'.
3.6.6 Relative Particle
-c(a) added to interrogative adjectives, pronouns and
produces the equivalent relative forms, as described earlier.adverbs90GEORGI AN GRAMMAR3.6.7 Emphatic Particles
We have already met -ve combined with some demonstratives. Attached
to the numeral '2' it gives or-i-ve 'both'. In association with other
numerals it means 'all NUmERAL' (e.g. otx-i-ve (ǰar+is+k'ac-i) 'all 4
(soldiers)'). In general its attachment adds the nuance of 'the very same,
just, precisely', e.g.

'So what is interfering with you? (sc. nothing is)'
ak'i is something akin to English 'look' (e.g. ak'i (Ø-)g-i-txar-i! 'look,
I have told you!').
Suffixed to the conditional conjunction tu the particle k'i gives us the
form tu-k'i meaning 'if indeed'.
The element tu, possibly functioning alone as a sort of abbreviated
condition, can add the sense of 'if at all' to an expression, e.g.
bodiš-i
jnel-ad
tu mo-(0-)a-rč-en-s
apology-NOM difficult-ADV if
PREV-(it-)NV-heal-TS-it(FUT)
mo+grex+il k'iser-s

neck-DAT
'an apology will only with difficulty (sc. if at all) heal a twisted neck (sc.
one who is destroyed/defeated)'
tu is also found in the negative phrases ara tu, which is synonymous
with ara mxolo+d 'not only' (cf. 5.2.1), and tu ara da, which is
synonymous with both t o r e m 'otherwise' and the full expression
c'ina+ag+m+deg še+mtxv+ev+a-ši 'in the opposite circumstance', e.g.
cocxal-i

alive-NOM PREV-[I -]come(FUT)tu ara da mo-v-kVd-eb-i
otherwise
PREV-I-die-TSFUT.INDIC
'I shall come (back) alive, otherwise I shall die'
We have met -ga in the sense of 'pray'. It can also mean 'only', in
which role it equals mxolo+d (e.g. gušin-c'in-ga (= mxolo+d gušinc'in) mo-k'vd-a 'X died only the day before yesterday').
dae/de(e) (which derives from the imperative d a - ( 0 - 0 - ) e - x s e n
'leave off it/let it be!') is used to strengthen commands, e.g.
dae,

da 'and' is used to conjoin individual words, phrases and also clauses (e.g.
šen da me 'you(SG) and I'; deda da mama 'mother and father';
u+pr+o+s-i jma da u+mcr+o+s-i da 'older brother and younger sister').
When the cases in which the conjoined nouns stand have long and short
forms, the conjunct that stands immediately before the da will take the
long form (e.g. (kart+v+el-eb-is,) m+egr+el-eb-isa da svan-eb-is
si+amaq'+e (GEORGIAN-Pl-GEN)Mingrelian-Pl-GEN and Svan-Pl-GEN
pride(NOM) 'the pride of (GEORGIANs,)Mingrelians and Svans'). Where
more than one noun is dependent on a postposition, the postposition usually
occurs just once at the end of the sequence, the first of a pair of such
conjoined dependent nouns standing in the long form of the relevant case
(e.g. sa+prang+et-sa da inglis-s šua France-DAT and England-DAT
between 'between France and England'). Where two adjectives are
conjoined, the first might take on the (long) case marking of its head-noun
rather than shew the simple concord-relation (e.g. k'bil+is+mier-isa da
nun+is+mier-i tan+xm+ovn-eb-is c'in dental-GEN and palatal-AGR
consonant-Pl-GEN before 'in front of dental and palatal consonants').
5.1.6.2 Disjunction
The simple equivalent of '(either...) or' is (an...) an, and this is true for
disjunctive conjunction of words, phrases or clauses (e.g. an si+k'vd+il-i
an ga+marjv+eb+a 'either death or victory'). When an is translateable
by 'or', it may take the ancient form anu (e.g. cocxal-i anu m+k'vd+ar-i
'alive or dead'), which latter is often found when in English we would have
'or rather/or, if you prefer/or, as some say, etc.', e.g.

5.1.7 The Verb Phrase
The interplay of case-marking and pronominal cross-referencing on the
verb is now illustrated for the different classes of verb. The two sets of
agreement-affixes presented in Chapter 4 and 5.Ø.1 are repeated below:549SYNTAXSet AAgreement-affixes1st person

agreement) if the relevant screeve belongs to Series I; (b) their subjects to
stand in the Ergative (with Set A agreement), their direct objects to stand

Some Transitive verbs have lost their original direct objects and are
thus construed with only one external NP (viz. the subject). Despite this,55ØGEORGIANGRAMMARthat subject requires the same c a š m a r k i n g and verb-agreement as a
'normal' transitive subject, e.g.
k'at'a-m
mo-(?Ø-)šard-a
cat-ERGA PREV-(?itB-)urinate-itA(AOR)
'the cat urinated'

Other Transitive verbs, though having lost their original direct object,
are stIII bivalent by virtue of taking an indirect object; 'hit' falls into this
category, e.g.

'the trainer hit the lion'(?Ø-)s-cem-a
(?itB-)itB-hit-heA(AOR)However, colloquially there is a tendency to normalise this verb by
treating the indirect object as the direct object and to c a š m a r k it
accordingly (viz. m+c'vrtn+el-ma lom-i (Ø-)?s-cem-a). A number of
what today are regular transitive verbs with subject and direct object were
in OldGEORGIANof the unregularised 'hit'-type (see Footnote 3 of Chapter

However, the verb ga-šv-eb-a 'let go' is unusual insofar as it always
incorporates the Objective Version in the first two screeve-Series, and yet
the entity which determines the person and shape of the object-agreement
plus version-vowel within the verb is now interpreted as the direct object,
as may be seen from the Nominative case of this argument in Series II, e.g.
q'araul-ma t'usag-i
ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-šv-a

Exactly the same pattern of c a š m a r k i n g and verb-agreement as is
found with Transitive verbs is also manifested by the so-called Medial
verbs, which usually occur with only one external NP (viz. the subject), e.g.
m+tvr+al-i
(nard-s)
(Ø-)i-tamaš-eb-s

(backgammon-DATB) (itB-)SV-play-TS-heA(FuT)

To IIIustrate a Medial with indirect object (but without a direct object
external to the verb) we take the verb 'guard', e.g.

Intransitive verbs take Nominative subjects (with Set A agreement) and
Dative indirect objects (with Set B agreement) in all three screeve-Series,
e.g.
xunj-eb-s
ra
da-(Ø-)e-mart-eb-a-t

IIIogical as it may seem, a few Intransitive verbs can be construed with
two indirect objects, both of which remain in the Dative across the three
Series, e.g.

In speech the syntax of such verbs is often remodelled, for obvious
reasons, by analogy with that of Transitives, especially in Series II, so that
instead of the prescriptively 'correct':
ost'at'-i
s-egird-s
mo+xmar+eba-s
master-NOMA
trainee-DATB
help-DATB
še-(?Ø-)h-p'ir-d-a

one may well hear:

mo+xmar+eb+a
master-ERGA trainee-DATB help(NOMB)
š(Ø-)h-p'ir-d-a
PREV-(itB-)himB-promišPASS-heA(AOR)
which makes the analysis of the d-exponent in the verb rather problematic!
Straightforward bivalent Intransitives are sometimes treated transitively by
virtue of being assigned an Ergative subject for their Series II screeves,
e.g.
rus+et-ma om-is
ga+mo+u+cxad+eb+1+iv t a v - s / /

In the Prešent Sub-Series the verb for 'tell/say X to Y' is
morphologically Intransitive and yet is construed with two Dative NPs, e.g.
deda
bavšv-s
t'q'u+il-s
mother(NOM) child-DAT lie-DAT
The mother is telling the child a lie'(Ø-Ø-)e-ubn-eb-a
(it-him-)IOV-tell-TS-she(PRES)554GEORGIANGRAMMARThough the root of this verb is suppletive in the Future Sub-Series, the
same applies, e.g.
deda bavšv-s t'q'u+il-s(Ø-Ø-)e-rq'v-i-s
tell-PASS-she(FuT)However, suppletion again occurs in both Series II and Series III, but
in both instances a transitive root is employed, so that it becomes clear
from c a š m a r k i n g that here we are dealing with fully-fledged direct vs
indirect objects, e.g.
deda-m
mother-ERGbavšv-s
child-DATt'q'u+il-i
lie-NOM(Ø-Ø-)u-txr-a
(it-him-)OV-tell-she(AOR)where (Ø-Ø-)u-txr-a is morphologically the Aorist of the Prešent
(Ø-Ø-)u-txr-ob-s 'X relates Y to Z'. Cf. the finite forms of mo-q'+ol-a
'relating', which are either bivalent or trivalent in all Series:

A few Intransitive verbs with a second argument are only found in
Series I, e.g.
i+ssopl-is
surat-s

'X gives a picture of the vIIIage'X(NOMA)(?Ø-)i-)l-ev-a

explanation.
An opposite type of IIIogicality is where the morphology of an
Intransitive verb points to the prešence of a Dative indirect object, and
yet the second NP in the clause is governed by a postposition and thus
cannot be dependent on the verb. This syntactic monovalence is often
given morphological recognition in III rd Series' forms, which are monopersonal rather than bi-personal in structure, e.g.

The magpie would regularly mix in with the chickens'xolme

The above-prešentation reprešents a verbal description and IIIustration

Stative Verbs in all Series, on the one hand, and Series I forms of
Transitive and Medial Verbs, on the other, whilst Pattern (iii) is shared

5.1.8 Causatives
5.1.8.1 Synthetic Causatives
5.1.8.1.1 Intransitive Verbs
When an intransitive verb is made causative, the subject of the embedded
Intransitive Verb becomes direct object of the matrix causative. To shew
this clearly all examples will be given in the Aorist tense, e.g.
av+ad+m+q'+op-i
da-c'v-a

Equally, a bivalent Intransitive Verb becomes a ditransitive verb under
causativisation, e.g.

5.1.8.1.2 Transitive Verbs
When a Transitive Verb is made causative, the subject of the embedded
Transitive Verb becomes indirect object of the matrix causative, whilst the
embedded direct object remains unchanged, e.g.","[565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576]"
"5Syntax5.Ø General Syntax
OnceGEORGIANverbal morphology has been mastered, the syntax of the
language is reasonably straightforward. Its subordinate clauses, unlike
those of North Caucasian languages, do not differ markedly from the
familiar structures of typical Indo-European languages with their use of
conjunctions plus interplay of indicative and subjunctive finite verb-forms.
However, so that those interested in syntax can approach this chapter
without necessarily having to work through all the detail prešented in the
preceding chapters (especially Chapter 4), I now include a short resumé of
the non-syntactic component ofGEORGIANgrammar.
5.0.1 Grammatical Resumč

by -Ø, and V stands for 'vowel'):NOMINATIVE

'mountains'Adjectives
When used as nouns, they decline according to the noun-pattern prešented
above. When qualifying a noun, the adjective stands first. As the noun
declines, a vowel-final adjective remains unchanged in both singular and
plural, whereas a consonant-final adjective manifests the following
agreement-pattern:NOMINATIVE
VOCATIVE
DATIVE
ERGATIVE
GENITIVE
INSTRuMENTAl
ADVERBIAlSingular/Plural
-i
-o
-Ø
-ma
-i
-i
-ØIn some older texts variations may be found: for example, a consonantfinal adjective may end in -is when coupled with either a Genitive or
Instrumental noun, and in -s with a Dative noun; alternatively such an
adjective may lack an ending altogether with a Genitive noun.
Numerals
The system from '11' to '19' is analysable as '10-UNIT-more'. From '2Ø' to
'99' the system is based on units of twenty (i.e. it is vigesimal), so that, for
example, '55' is literally '2-times-2Ø-and-(1Ø-5-more)', Any adjective that
states a quantity, such as a cardinal numeral, is prescriptively conjoined
with the singular form of the noun.
Pronouns
1st and 2nd person pronouns remain unchanged for the cases used to
encode the verb's main arguments (viz. Nominative, Dative, Ergative). The
3rd person pronoun reflects some older features, with its Ergative Singular525SYNTAX
in -n and a reduced plural, e.g.","[541, 542, 543, 544]"
"9/1Ø. In order to give a flavour of the difference between Old and Modern
GEORGIANI have chošen a text that exists in both, namely the Bible—
specifically chapter 1Ø verses 17-22 & 25 from the Gospel according to St.
Mark. The OldGEORGIANversion is taken from the oldest dated manuscript
for theGEORGIANGospels, namely the Adysh Codex (manuscript C), which is
dated 897 and takes its name from the small vIIIage in Svanetia where the
manuscript was discovered. The manuscript was published in 1945 by
Ak'ak'i Shanidze. The modern translation below was published in 1982 by
the Institute for Bible Translation in Stockholm.

1. When he was coming out onto the road, a certain rich man rushed out
towards him, knelt down in front of him and said to him entreatingly: «Good684GEORGIANGRAMMARMaster, what should I do in order that I might inherit eternal life?» 2.
And Jesus said to him: «Why do you call me 'good'. 3. No-one is good
apart from one alone—God. 4. You know the commandments: do not
commit adultery, do not kIII, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not
lie, honour your father and mother.» 5. He replied to him: «Master, all of
these have I done from my youth.» 6. Jesus looked at him, felt love for
him and said to him: «You lack one thing: go, sell what you possess and give
it to the poor, and you will have reward in heaven; [OldGEORGIAN= take up
the cross andj come and follow me.» 7. But he became dispirited at these
words and went away sorrowful, since he had many possessions... 8. It is
easier for a camel [OldGEORGIAN= ropej to pass through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.","[697, 698, 699, 700, 701, 702, 703]"

The language distinguishes not only in the basic negative particles but also
in all parts of speech (pronouns, adverbs, adjectives) that may be derived
therefrom the three types of negation: (a) simple ('X does not VERB'), (b)
potential ('X cannot VERB'), (c) prohibition ('Do not VERB!').
Verbs
Structurally aGEORGIANverb may incorporate such elements (morphemes)
as the following:
(1) Preverb(s) - (2) Agreement Prefix - (3) Version Vowel - (4) ROOT - (5)
Causative Suffix(es) - (6) Passive Formant [-d-j - (7) Thematic Suffix - (8)
Perfect/Stative Marker - (9) Past Marker [-(o)d-j - (1Ø) Tense/Mood Vowel
- (11) Agreement Suffix/Pluraliser
Preverbs originally indicated direction, a function they retain with
verbs of motion, but today they largely serve to denote perfective aspect
(i.e. the carrying of a verbal activity through to its conclusion) and tend to
occur everywhere outside the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. Prešent Indicative,
Imperfect Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive) with Transitive and Intransitive
verbs.
Verbs can agree not only with their subject (as is the norm for the
Indo-European language-family) but with both direct and indirect objects.
Agreement is achieved by means of items (2) and (11) from the above-list.
There are two sets of agreement-affixes.

between affixal group and cašmarking, three patterns exist, as depicted

"364GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.4 Indirect Verb Class (inversi+ul-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)
However they were originally conceived, Indirect Verbs today are those
whose (logical) subject, no matter what the Series, stands in the Dative
case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by means of an agreementaffix of Set B, whilst the (logical) direct object, no matter what the Series,
stands in the Nominative case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by
means of an agreement-affix of Set A—allGEORGIANverbs must carry at
the very least a Set A affix, but for some Indirect Verbs there may be no
Nominative nominal external to the verb to provide a concrete referent for
the relevant affix. Since the Dative nominal is today perceived to be the
subject, an appropriate 3rd person plural Dative will have its plurality
marked on the verb but only in the prešence of a 3rd person direct object,
whilst the plurality of a 3rd person Nominative will, of course, never be
marked on the verb today, because this is viewed as the direct object, and
direct objects do not (prescriptively at any rate) have their plurality
signalled in the verb. This gives us, for example, mk'vidr-eb-s s-)ul-t
m o + m + x d + u r - i / m o + m + x d + u r - e b - i 'the natives hate the incomer/
incomers', which is a reversal of the older pattern of agreement, whereby
the plurality of the 3rd person Dative was ignored, whilst that of the 3rd
person Nominative was indeed marked on the verb, giving as the older
part-equivalent to the above: mk'vidr-s/mk'vidr-eb-s
s-)ul-an
mo+m+xd+ur-eb-i 'the native/natives hate(s) the incomers'. This devel­
opment in the pattern of agreement suggests that originally it was the
Nominative nominal which was interpreted as the subject, whereas the
Dative nominal will at that time have been the indirect object of a normal
bivalent Intransitive Verb; such agreement is common in traditional folk­
tales and is found in the works of the late 19th to the early 2Øth century
writer Vazha Pshavela.
It is sometimes difficult, especially with verbs containing the Indirect
Object Versioniser, to tell whether we are dealing with a bivalent
Intransitive Verb or an Indirect Verb. In 4.1 we mentioned the different
agreement-patterns for the verb 'be born to' as attested in the two
examples from the 19th century writers Ilia C'avč'avadze and Ak'ak'i
Ts'ereteli respectively, namely:
si+t'q'v+a-n-i gul-ši
m-e-bad-eb-i-an

heart-in me-IOV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-PL

(Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t
child-Pl-NOM (3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-3rd.PER-Pl
'children are born to themDAT'
Does this feature alone mean that the former verb-form is to be
interpreted as a bivalent Intransitive, whilst the latter is to be viewed as
an Indirect Verb? Similarly, if we translate the example p'at'ar+jal-i gve-čven-o-s, p'at'ar+jal-i! 'let the bride shew herself to us, the bride!',
we would judge it to be a bivalent Intransitive, whereas if we translate the
example cot'a maril+ian-i m-e-čven-a sa+č'm+el-i 'I deemed the
food a little salty', we might be tempted to regard the verb as Indirect
(because the 1st person Dative argument is rendered in English as the
subject of the verb), whereas the translation 'the food seemed to me a little
salty' would perhaps favour a bivalent Intransitive interpretation (with 'to
me' equating to the Dative argument of theGEORGIAN).Personally, however,
I would argue that both these verbs in all the usages illustrated above are
to be interpreted as bivalent Intransitives.
In the Prešent Sub-Series the Dative subject is sometimes marked by
means of the agreement-affix alone; alternatively some verb-forms require
the prešence of the Objective Version, others the prešence of the locative
Version, and yet others the prešence of the Indirect Object Version. In
the Future Sub-Series, on the other hand, many Indirect Verbs take the
form of a prefixal Intransitive with obligatory e-versioniser.
Indirect
Verbs proper possess no Series II screeves, and so the Imperfect and
Prešent Subjunctive will take the place of the anticipated Aorist Indicative
and Aorist Subjunctive respectively. The Imperfect Indicative (and Prešent
Subjunctive) will take either -d- or -od- as post-radical marker according
to the requirements of the verb-form in question. In Series III Indirect
Verbs have the basic morphology of bivalent Intransitives, which is to say
that the stem is the Masdar, though it is of course necessary to know the
correct form of the Masdar, which in some cases might not be a
straightforward matter.
In the Prešent Indicative a 1st or 2nd person direct object is indicated
by attaching to the stem the appropriate form of the Prešent tense of the
copula, whilst a 3rd person Nominative nominal is indicated by either -s or
-a, as required by the verb in question. Since it is verb-forms rather than
roots which are classified for conjugational type, readers will by now have
come to expect that the root of any given Indirect Verb is likely to have
cognate verb-forms of other conjugational types; these will be pointed out
as we go along.","[382, 383, 384]"

2.2.3.1.4 Semi-indirect Quotation
This strategy employs rom accompanied by appropriate changes of person,
though the tense of the quoted verb remains what it was at the moment of
speech/thought, e.g.

Regardless of the construction employed, the use of deictic and spatiotemporal markers seems to be quite free, either that which was appropriate
at the moment of speech/thought or that appropriate at the moment of
citation being permitted, as long as the precise reference is clear from the
context.
For a fuller discussion of speech-reporting inGEORGIAN(and other
Caucasian languages) see Hewitt and Crisp (1986). For a separate study of
the particle - t k o / - t k v - a see Hewitt (1982) or, in English and with
corrections to the earlier German translation, (1984). On parataxis in
Caucasian languages and the relevance thereto of direct quotation see
Hewitt (1984a) or, in German translation, (1984b). For a peculiarity of
speech-reporting in the related Svan language see Hewitt (1982a).
5.2.2.3.1.5 Indirect Commands
An indirect command can, of course, be conveyed by direct quotation with
appropriate speech-particle. Otherwise the finite reprešentation will
conform to the rules given earlier for purpošclauses, namely either the618GEORGIANGRAMMARAorist SUBJunctive or Pluperfect Indicative will be used.
Masdar is possible as the non-finite variant, e.g.","[633, 634, 635, 636, 637]"

Even an indirect object of the finite form of the verb in question can
surface in the Genitive, e.g.

With past (passive) participles of Transitive Verbs the underlying agent,
if a noun or 3rd person pronoun, stands in the Genitive governed by mier
'by' (occasionally by -gan 'from', or even in the Genitive alone), e.g.

'the cheešbread mother made'
lst/2nd person pronouns when governed by free-standing postpositions
that usually require the Genitive case may add a final -s, which has more
the look of a Dative about it than a Genitive (e.g. čven(-s) mier da-tvlil-i us(GEN)(-?DAT) by PREV-count-RPTC-NOM
'that which has been
counted by us' vs čem-gan ga-mo-gzavn-il-i me(GEN)-by PREV-PREV-54ØGEORGIANGRAMMARsend-P.PTC-NOM'the one šent (hither) by me').
The bare stem of the intransitive subject or transitive direct object can
be incorporated within past participles, just as similar concatenations can
occur with ordinary adjectives, e.g.

cf. gon+eb+a-maxvil-i mind-sharp-AGR 'sharp-minded'.
The basic verb's indirect object will usually be governed by the
appropriate postposition (most commonly -tvis 'for') when it stands
alongside the participle, though the simple Dative is not uncommon with
past participles, e.g.
bavšv-is-tvis pul-is
mi-m-c-em-i

5.1.4 Adpositions
GEORGIANis a postpositional language. The most frequently governed cases
are the Genitive and Dative, though only the Vocative and Ergative are
totally excluded from postpositional governance. Some postpositions stand
as separate words, whilst others fuse with their (pro-)nouns and were thus
described by Vogt as 'secondary cases'. The formal parallelism between
certain postpositions and verbal preverbs (e.g. -gan 'from' as in šen-gan
'from you' vs its preverbal role in a verb like gan-(Ø-)a-iarag-es PREV(X-)NV-disarm-they(AOR.INDIC) 'they disarmed X', or -Si 'in' as in q'ut-ši
'in the/a box' vs its preverbal role in a verb like š ( Ø - ) a - i a r a g - e s
PREV-(X-)NV-arm-they(AORJNDIC) 'they armed X') suggests an adverbial
origin, which in some instances is stIII actually manifested in OldGEORGIAN.
Some postpositions such as garda 'apart from' sometimes stand before
their noun, in which case the long form of the Genitive is obligatory (e.g.
si+amaq'-is garda/garda si+amaq'-isa 'apart from pride'). Another
common example is mi+u+xed+av+ad 'despite', which is the Adverbial
c a š f o r m of the privative participle of mi-xed-v-a 'looking to'.
Note the position of the postpositional phrase in theGEORGIAN
translation of phrases like 'the problem of Great Britain's relationship with
the other countries of Europe' (i.e. between the adnominal Genitive and the
head-noun), viz.","[557, 558, 559, 560]"
"358GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.3.5 Medial Verbs with Indirect Object (Relative Medials)
Indirect objects with Medials are marked in a variety of ways.
In some cases the Objective Version may be used in the expected way
to create an indirect object for the verb. For some verbs this is only
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. Examples: sisxl-i g-i-dug-s 'your
blood is boiling'; mgel-s k'b+il-eb-i cecxl-i-vit
(Ø-)u-el-av-s/(Ø-)uel+v+ar-eb-s 'the wolfs teeth flash like fire'; mtel-i sxeul-i m-i-špotav-s, m-i-trt-i-s = m-i-trt+ol-av-s = m-i-k'ank'al-eb-s = m - i caxcax-eb-s = m-i-)agjag-eb-s 'my whole body is roused, is shaking',
or with a different šense si+garib+e-s ar v-(Ø-)u-trt-i(-v-a+r) 'I do
not quake before poverty' (cf. jar-i ar (Ø-)u-prtx-i-s 99
si+cx+e-s 'the
army is not afraid of the heat'). Where the Thematic Suffix is -eb in both
Prešent and Future Sub-Series, such forms in Objective Version may be
ambiguous between Prešent of the basic Medial and Future of the
(pseudo-)Causative. And so, if we take the Future of trt-i-s, we get
(?Ø-)i-trt+ol-eb, which gives the (pseudo-)Causative
(Ø-)a-trt+ol-eb-s
'X makes (will make) Y/them tremble', which in Objective Version is (ØØ-)u-trt+ol-eb-s 'X (will) make Y/them tremble for Z/them', and this is
given in KEGl with the glosses
(Ø-Ø-)u-caxcax-eb-s/(Ø-Ø-)uk'ank'al-eb-s (and we could add (Ø-Ø-)u-)agjag-eb-s)), even though
surprisingly these verb-forms under their own entries are only glossed in
KEGl itself as though they were restricted to functioning as synonyms of
(Ø-)u-trt-i-s.
However, for other verbs the Objective Version is
acceptable throughout Series I and 11 (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)uq'vir-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-e/g-i-q'vir-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you shout/
will shout/ shouted/ have shouted at X';
(Ø-Ø-)u-mger(-i)/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)umger-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-mger-e/g-i-mger-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you sing/
will sing/sang/have sung to X'; ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-rb-i-x-a+r/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)
u-rb-en/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-rb-in-e/ga-g-i-rb-en-i-a m-is-gan 'you
run/will run/ran/have run away from X').
Sometimes the indirect object along with its agreement-prefix is simply
added to the basic Medial in the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. (Ø-)p'asux-ob
'you give an answer' vs (Ø-)h-p'asux-ob 'you answer X/them' 1 Ø Ø ;
(Ø-)q'araul-ob = (Ø-)daraj-ob = q'araul-ada x-a+r 'you are on guard'
vs (Ø-)h-q'araul-ob = (Ø-)s-daraj-ob 'you guard X/them'). However, in
the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11 the Objective Version has to be
used when the indirect object is prešent (e.g. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-eb/(Ø?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-e 'you will answer/ answered X/them'; (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)uq'araul-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'araul-e = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-daraj-eb/(Ø-?ØØ-)u-daraj-e 'you will guard/guarded X/them'); (Ø-Ø-)h-k'arnaxo b / ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) u - k ' a r n a x - e b ) 'you (will) direct X/themI O in theVERBAl MORPHOlOGY359writing/thinking of Y/themDO' behaves the same way. In Series III the
basic Medial formation is used and the underlying indirect object surfaces
as the postpositional object of - t v i s (e.g. sa+gare+o
sa+km+e-ta
minist'r-s (Ø-)u-p'asux-(n-)i-?a šen-tvis 'the Foreign Minister has
answered you').
In the case of (Ø-Ø-)švel-i 'you aid X/them' (Imperfect (Ø-Ø-)švelod-i) the verb cannot be used without an indirect object, and although in
the Future Sub-Series and Series 11 the Objective Version is employed, the
usual Thematic Suffix -eb does not substitute for -i, giving the Future (Ø?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i 'you will help X/them' (for which Vogt quotes the
Conditional (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-Svel-i-d-i)—N.B. 'help!' is (Ø-?Ø-)m-i-švel-el.
For 'offer' the Future does substitute -eb but additionally takes the
preverb š ( m o - ) (viz. (Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-ob 'you offer X/them to Y/them' =>
Future še-(mo-}(Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-eb); in the Perfect this Thematic Suffix is
retained, giving še-(mo-)g-i-tavaz-eb-i-a
-tvis, Pluperfect š e (mo-)g-e-tavaz-eb-in-a -tvis.
For 'laugh at, mock' the endings in all Series are the same as for the
basic Medial (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i 'you laugh' (Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb =>
Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-e => Perfect g-i-cin-i-?a), but in the Future SubSeries and in Series 11 the indirect object prefix takes the place of the iversioniser and in addition the preverb da- is always prešent, giving da(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-i/da-(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb 'you (will) mock X/them'. This
contrasts with the Objective Version coupled to the basic Medial (Ø-Ø-)ucin-i/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you (will) look at X/them and laugh' 1Ø1
(Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis), which has the synonym še-(mo-)(Ø-)scin-i/še-(mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb (Perfect še-(mo-)g-i-cin-eb-i-?a
-tvis); cf. the semelfactives ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will break into a
laugh' (Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a), ča-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will laugh
quietly to yourself' vs ča-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you will laugh quietly to
X/them' (Perfect ša-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis). The formally bipersonal (but
monovalent) prefixal Intransitive Verb-form (ga-)g-e-cin-eb-?a is, of
course, an Indirect Verb (see 4.7.4) with the 2nd person addressee here the
(unintentional) laugher as the verb-form means 'you (will) break out into a
laugh' (=> Aorist ga-g-e-cin-?a => Perfect ga-g-cin-eb-i-?a).
[It might be thought that 'smile' would behave the same way as 'laugh',
but this is not so. KEGl recognises no verb-form of the type *(Ø-)gimi / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - g i m - e b , quoting g i m - i as an alternative to the
Masdar/abstract-noun gim+il-i; and Tschenkčli's Dictionary quotes such a
Prešent Indicative as (Ø-)gim-i only as a theoretical construct on the
basis of the form (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i with Objective Version, given below.
(ga-)(Ø-)i-gim-eb-i is a normal Intransitive Verb 'you (will) smile' (Aorist36ØGEORGIANGRAMMARga-(Ø-)i-gim-e => Perfect ga-(Ø-)gim-eb-ul-x-a+r, though there is an
alternative inverted Series III set of screeves with Perfect ga-g-i-gim-i?a, which does give the verb some affinity with the Medial class). For 'you
smile at X/them' we have a choice of (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i 102 (Imperfect (ØØ-)u-gim-od-i) or (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-gim-eb => the Future ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)ugim-eb => Aorist ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-gim-e => Perfect ga-g-i-gim-i-?a
-tvis. Note the alternative semantic relationship between the arguments
for (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i in the Prešent Sub-Series only as seen in čfem-s
m+š+ob+1-eb-s p'ir-i (Ø-)u-gim-i-t 'my parents' face(s) break into a
little smile'; cf. g-e-gim-eb-?a 'you break into a reluctant smile', which
form is regular for a prefixal bipersonal Intransitive in terms of its
morpho-syntax with Future ga-g-e-gim-eb-?a => Aorist ga-g-e-gim-?a
=> Perfect ga-g-g im-eb-i-a. The form da-(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look
smilingly down upon X/them' is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series and
should be compared with a group of similar verb-forms prešented under
'see' in 4.1Ø. However, the parallels še-(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look
thither (hither) smilingly at X/them' have a full set of screeves across the
paradigms with Future še-(mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)gim-eb => Aorist še-(mo-)(Ø?Ø-Ø-)gim-e => Perfect še-(mo-)g-i-gim-eb-i-?a -tvis.]
The verb for 'shout' is (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-di/(Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-od-i) => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-e => Perfect g-i-)ax-(n-)i?a, which also serves for the abšent Future Sub-Series, for the anticipated
Medial Future (Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-eb is actually the formal Prešent 'you
summon/call out X/them', used with a variety of preverbs but especially
ga-mo-, as in the expression ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-eb 'you will
call out the doctor' (Aorist ekim-i ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-i
ga-mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a/ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a), which does not differ
in meaning from ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb (Aorist ekim-s gamo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-is-tvis ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-?a).
With Objective Version attached to the basic Medial we have (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)ujax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-d-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-od-i), which
means either 'you (will) shout to X/them' or analysed as (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-i
'you (will) give the name X to Y/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e => Perfect
g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis), in which latter šense (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-c'od-eb 1 0 3
is a
synonym; in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-i (Imperfect
(Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-(o)d-i) is also a synonym for both usages. As a
semelfactive in the perfective screeves there is da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-eb 'you
will shout out (something)' (Perfect da-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a) and in Objective
Version da-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb 'you will shout out (something) to X/them'
(Perfect da-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis). da-(Ø-(Ø-))s-]ax-i is limited to the
Prešent Sub-Series and means 'shout down (something) to X/them'. še-(Ø-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY361(Ø-))s-]ax-i means 'you shout (something) at X/them' with the Future še(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis), though KEGl also
quotes, interestingly without any indirect object affix indicated, š ( Ø ?Ø-)jax-eb 'you will shout out in excitement' (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-(n-)i?a). With preverb š e - m o - only še-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb is quoted in
KEGl but with two meanings and two partly differentiated paradigms: in
the šense 'you will start to sing out song X' the Perfect is še-mo-g-i-)ax(n-)i-a, whilst in the šense of 'you will address (some words) loudly to a
by-stander Y' the Perfect is š m o - g - i - ) a x - e b - i - a -tvis). For ča-(ØØ-)s-]ax-i/ša-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you (will shout something down into at
X/them' the Perfect is given as ča-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis, whereas for a(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you will shout something up to X/them' only non-Prešent
Sub-Series forms are given (Perfect a-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis). mo-(Ø?Ø-)s-)ax-i is glossed as 'you sound a reply to X/them' or 'you follow
someone coming in this direction shouting at them' whilst mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)axeb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis) is said to be a synonym for the
locative Versional mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a
-tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud verbal message hither at X/them' 104;
and mi-(Ø-?Ø-)s-)ax-i is 'you follow someone going somewhere else
shouting at them', with mi-(Ø-Ø-)s-]ax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a
-tvis) said to be a synonym for the locative Versional mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)ajax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud
verbal message thither at X/them'105.
The pattern just illustrated with preverbs m o - / m i - combining with the
locative Version is found with a number of other verbs to indicate
suddenly shouting at someone with the particular voice-quality of the
verbal root. Examples: mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you will suddenly
yell something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'vir-eb-i-a -tvis); m o /mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'iv+l-eb 'you will suddenly crow something at X/them'
(Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'iv+l-eb-i-a -tvis); mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb
'you will suddenly tearfully shout something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-gi-t'ir-eb-i-a -tvis);mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-čxav+l-eb1Ø6
'you will suddenly
screech/mew something at X/them' (Perfect mi-g-i-čxav+1-eb-i-a
-tvis). For the corresponding forms of 'bark' KEGl quotes only mi-(?ØØ-)a-q'ep-s '(dog) will bark at X/them' as a synonym for da-/še-(?ØØ-)u-q'ep-s; the form also differs structurally from those just listed
insofar as it has the Perfect mi-(Ø-)u-q'ep-(?n-)i-?a -tvis.
Sometimes the e-versioniser is employed, and the verb-form has the
morpho-syntactic patterning in Series 1 and 11 of a bipersonal prefixal
Intransitive (which is to say that the subject in Series II stands in the
Nominative); in these cases there is often no formal difference between362GEORGl AN GRAMMARPrešent and Future Sub-Series. When there is no preverb associated with
this formation, Series 111 departs from the morpho-syntax of an
Intransitive Verbs and simply takes the basic Medial (inverted) verb-form,
making the indirect object dependent on a suitable postposition. With two
such verbs there is a formal difference between Prešent and Future SubSeries: from
(Ø-)i-brjv-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-brj+ol-eb
'you (will) fight' we have
(Ø-Ø-)e-brjv-i 'you fight X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-eb-i =>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-e => Perfect g-i-brj+ol-(n-)i-?a -tan; but from
(Ø-(Ø-))i-svr-i/(Ø-Ø-)i-sr+ol-eb 'you (will) shoot (X/them)' we have (Ø(Ø-)Ø-)e-svr-i 'you (will) shoot (X/them) at Y/them', which then gives the
Aorist (Ø-(Ø-)Ø-)e-sr+ol-e, which, though formally the expected shape,
is treated as a Transitive Verb with Ergative subject and 3rd person plural
marked by -es (rather than the anticipated -nen); the Perfect is g-i-svri-a/g-i-sr+ol-(?n-)i-a -tvis. Further examples: (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-eb-i
'you (will) whisper/talk in whispers to X/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-e
=> Perfect g-i-čurčul-(n-)i-a -tvis-, (Ø-Ø-)e-(5ipc?ip-eb-i 'you (will)
talk with a lisp to X/them' (no Series III); (Ø-Ø-)e-k'amat-eb-i 'you (will)
argue with X/them' => Perfect g-i-k'amat-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-čxubeb-i => Perfect g-i-čxub-(?n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you
(will) speak with X/them' => Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (ØØ-)e-musaip-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-maslaat-eb-i
= (Ø-Ø-)e-baas-eb-i 'you (will) converse with X/them' => Perfect g-imusaip-(n-)i-?a (etc..) -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you (will) play with
X/them' => g-i-tamaš-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you (will) flirt
with X/them' => g-i-aräiq'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you (will)
joke with X/them' => Perfect g-i-xumr-(?n-)i-?a -tan.
Some of these bipersonal Intransitive derivatives may also permit a
preverb to be used in the perfective screeves, the meaning of which seems
to be little more than an inceptive (plus an indirect object). The morphosyntax of these forms is entirely regular across the three Series, such that
in Series III they remain faithful to the bipersonal Intransitive paradigm
taking their subject in the Nominative and forming the screeves on a
notional Masdar-stem that incorporates the Thematic Suffix -eb (as noted
in Hewitt 1987a.335-336; and as discussed by Tuite 1993). Examples: da(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i
= ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i = g a - m o (Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i
'you will engage X/them in conversation' =>
Perfect da-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-eb-i-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-ebi-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)sa+ub+r-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i
'you will start to play with X/them' => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-ix+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you will start to flirt with X/them' =>
Perfect ga-(Ø-Ø-)aršiq'-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you willVERBAl MORPHOlOGY363say something jokingly to X/them; you will start to joke with X/them' =>
Perfect ga(Ø-Ø-)xumr-eb-i-x-a+r; š(Ø-Ø-)e-k'amat-eb-i 'you will
take issue with X/them' => Perfect še-lØ-)h-k'amat-eb-i-x-a+r.
Occasionally the preverbal form changes from an Intransitive to
Transitive Verb-form with indirect object, so that if a person will start a
conversation with someone at his side, this may be expressed literally,
using one of the Intransitive Verb-forms just prešented, as: gverd-it
m+q'+op-s ga-mo-(Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-a; alternatively the Transitive
form (i+s) gada-(?Ø-Ø-}u-lap'arak'-eb-s (Aorist (man) gada-(?ØØ-)u-lap'arak'-a, Perfect (ma-s) gada-(Ø-)u-lap'arak'-eb-i-?a 107
ma-s-tan) encapsulates this notion entirely within itself; if the speaking to
one's neighbour is soft, then (5a-(?Ø-Ø-)u-lap,arak,-eb-s is used, which,
according to KEGl, contrasts with the bipersonal Intransitive with this
preverb, namely ča-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i, for which the meaning is
'you will talk down to X/them' (e.g. of a person to a dog). Another such
Transitive is ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-tamaš-eb 'you will skirt X/them playing;
you will start to play with X/them' (Perfect ga-g-i-tamaš-eb-i-?a -tan),
where, however, we have an alternative Intransitive, but this time it is the
inceptive suffixal Intransitive in Objective Version (viz. ga-(Ø-Ø-)utamaš-d-eb-i => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r)!","[376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382]"

Where the temporal šense is indisputably 'before' (i.e. when the main verb

is accompanied by the Future SUBJunctive in the subordinate clause (though
the Future Indicative is also feasible when reference is to a specific
event), whilst a past tense main verb is partnered by the Conditional in the
dependent clause (though the Aorist Indicative is possible when there is no

where the negated Aorist SUBJunctive of the subordinate clause is

ar da-(Ø-)i-jer-eb-s).
As far as non-finite reprešentations are concerned, again the notions
'until' and 'before' merge in the use of the postposition -mde (older -mdis)

5.2.2.2 Adjectival (Relative) Clauses
5.2.22.1 Construction with full relative pronoun and preposed head
For a full discussion see Hewitt (1985, and 1987 chapter 8); Aronson (1975)
also looks at relative clauses.
When the relative pronouns vin-c 'who', ra-c 'which', romel-i-c 'who,
which' are used, they stand first in the clause (or as part of the first
constituent) and take the case appropriate to their function within the
subordinate clause. The first two do not require the prešence of a head,
e.g.
vin-c
who(NOM)-RElšmo-vid-a,
PREV-PREV-enter-he(AOR)ga-(?Ø-Ø-)u-marj-o-s
PREV-[?it-him-)OVwelcome-AOR.SUBJ-X(?God)'Welcome to (the one) who has entered!'
Where a head is prešent, if it consists of a full lexical noun, then the
third pronoun will be more likely to be used, e.g.
avt'or-i,
ro+ml-is
c'ign-s(a-c)
author-NOM who-GEN
book-DAT(-REl)
'the author whose book they are burning...'(Ø-)c'v-av-en,..
(them-)burn-TS-they6Ø1SYNTAXWhere the head-constituent consists of just a demonstrative pronoun or
such non-specific elements as q'vela 'all', q'vela+per-i 'everything' etc.,
then either vin-c or ra-c will be used, e.g.
i+s,
ra-c

'What you have is no good'

'Everyone who follows nationalism will betray his country'There is no strict adherence to-number-agreement between head and

formally singular but semantically plural head may be construed with a
plural form of romel-i-c, e.g.

For purposes of emphasis the co-referential NP inside the subordinate
clause may be retained alongside the head-noun in the main clause. In
such cases the co-referential NP will be accompanied by romel-i (or ra)
in adjectival function, the relative particle -c attaching to the coreferential NP, e.g.
i+s

In an expression such as 'If you take that money, (an act) which I do
not advise, you will be punished', where the inserted clause refers not to a
specific head but rather to the whole conditional clause,GEORGIANwould

No example was offered above for the preverbs c ' a - / c ' a - m o - , c'abasically indicating 'forward' (cf. c'in 'in front, before, ahead'), in the
Prešent of the verb of motion. This is because such couplings are not
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. However, elsewhere in the paradigm
these preverbs do come into play, and the question arises as to how one
differentiates between, say, the Futures c'a-va and rni-va, both signifying
'X will go'. The answer is that c'a- emphasises the departure and
journeying, whilst mi- implies reaching the destination (e.g. bič'-i c'a-va
sk'ola-ši 'the lad will go to school' vs bič'-i mi-va buxar-tan 'the lad
will go upto the stove'). The same interplay is observed with the verb for
'take'—in the Prešent Sub-Series only mi- is possible, e.g.
eg c'ign-i
sad
mi-g-a-kv-s?
that book-NOM where? PREV-you-lV-take-it
'Where are you taking that book?'
whereas elsewhere the same nuances as just described attach to the
preverbs mi- and c'a-, e.g.

The difference between mo- and c'a-mo- is that the former indicatesVERBAl MORPHOlOGY153simple motion towards speaker or hearer, whereas the latter implies motion
'away' towards or with speaker or hearer (e.g. mo-(Ø-)di a+k! 'come
here!' vs c'a-mo-(Ø-)i, ert+ad c'a-vid-e-t! 'Come on away/along, let's
go together!', or:
mo-(Ø-)i-ca,
čven-c
PREV-(you-)SV-wait(I MPER) we(NOM)-tooc'a-mo-val-t
PREV-PREVcome(lst.PER)-Pl'Hold on, we'll come along too')
From their original role as markers of directionality/orientation the
preverbs took on the function of marking perfective aspect with the result
that today for the bulk of verbs in the Transitive and Intransitive classes
the relevant preverb will usually be prešent in screeves other than those
of the Prešent Sub-Series. The addition of the appropriate (and usually
unpredictable) preverb to the Prešent Indicative of most Transitive or
Intransitive verbs produces the Future Indicative (e.g. (Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s
'X does/makes Y/them' => ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s 'X will do/make Y/them').
In OldGEORGIANthere was no independent Future Indicative screeve, the
Prešent or Aorist Subjunctive as appropriate (sc. according to aspect)
making up the deficiency. The association of root with preverb can then
come to play a lexical role, for by altering the preverb from ga- to šewith the root -k'et- we produce a verb-form with the lexical meaning
'repair' (e.g. ro+di+s še-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-en a+m t'elevizor-s? 'When
will they repair this television?'), the preverbless Prešent (Sub-Series) forms
being ambiguous out of context for the meanings 'do/make' vs 'repair'.
Another example would be the verb 'kill' which normally takes the preverb
m o - (e.g. bič'-ma baq'aq'-i mo-(Ø-)k'l-a 'the lad killed the frog'), but if
the killing is with a knife (typically of an animal slaughtered in ritualistic
sacrifice or for preparation as food), then the preverb da- takes over, e.g.
dia+saxl+is-ma katam-i
da-(Ø-)k'l-a
da
housewife-ERG
chicken-NOM PREV-(it-)kill-she(AOR) and
(Ø-)gv-a-č'am-a
(it-)us-lV-feed-she(AOR)
'the housewife killed the chicken (sc. by slitting its throat) and fed it to
us'
These couplings do not exhaust the possibilities for the root 'kill', and
the range of couplings well illustrates the way the inter-dependencies of
root and preverb (as well as Version) complicate the lexical structure of154GEORGI AN GRAMMARthe language. Consider:

Also consider (da-)(Ø-Ø-)loc-av 'you (will) bless X/them' vs (äe-/gamo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-loc-av 'you (will) mouth a healing mantra over X/them'.
The reason for the choice of preverb in most of the examples in the
previous paragraph is, I think, opaque—synonymous roots can be found
which, despite their parallel semantics, take different preverbs (e.g. da-scin-eb = ga-kird-av 'you will mock X'). Sometimes, the change can be
explained in terms of the original directional force of the preverb and the
basic lexical meaning of the root is little altered. The normal preverb for
-ngr- 'ruin' is da-, e.g.
revolucia-m

'we always imagined there to be loaves in the chest if a harvestless

Intransitives it is usual for a preverb to be prešent in the verbal complex.
In Series II, however, and less commonly perhaps in Series III, one may
find finite Transitive (very rarely Intransitive) verbs without the expected
preverb. The nuance attaching to such forms is that an action, expressed
as aspectually non-durative (hence the use of Series II), nevertheless does
not reach its natural conclusion, which would motivate the prešence of the
preverb as marker of perfective aspect. Consider the contrast between
preverbless and preverbal forms in the proverb:

'this is not an affair that is easily to be accomplished, but it is
demanded of you that we do it' (Literary Georgia, 18 Jan 1991, p.7)At first glance this would appear to refer to a quite specific affair and
therefore to require the preverb ga-. However, the previous šentence
reads: 'It is our duty to purify the path for the national movement of all
sorts of falsehood and overpower on this road the enemy's tricks,
deceptions and illusions'. In other words, the sa + km + e in question
involves a whole series of individual actions, the fulfilment of each one of
which will not necessarily result in the completion of the series overall,
hence the lack of the preverb.
Just as in the Future Participle of the last example, the non-finite
verbal noun (Masdar) may be used without the anticipated preverb. The
following examples from a single article in the paper droni Times' (11 Oct
1991, p.7) shew how difficult it can be to distinguish between preverbal and
preverbless forms, for in both instances we have the same verbal root
dependent upon the main verb 'begin', and yet one occurrence has the
preverb, whilst the other lacks it, viz.
p'at'imr-eb-ma

from the outside'
One might argue from a logical perspective that talk of the beginning of
any action cannot be the appropriate moment to emphasise perfective
aspect for the relevant activity. However, it is clearly the case that
masdars dependent on this verb more often than not will indeed carry their
preverb (cf. from the self-same article:

If, as we have seen, it is often not possible to predict which preverb
will be employed for a given root or why a switch to another preverb
should result in the precise change of meaning that on this or that occasion
will occur, it is nevertheless true that some preverbs have come to be
associated with a particular nuance which they introduce into the
semantics of a verb-form when they replace the root's normal preverb. It
is now time to look at these interesting nuances.
In addition to the example given in the introductory section of this
chapter for Se- marking the application of the verbal action to only a
slight degree, theGEORGIANDictionary of Morphemes quotes: še-ten-d-a
'dawn broke somewhat' vs ga-ten-d-a 'dawn broke', še-šr-a 'X dried a
little' vs ga-šT-a 'X dried', še-xm-a 'X dried up a little' vs ga-xm-a 'X
dried up', še-c'itl-d-a 'X turned slightly red' vs ga-c'itl-d-a 'X turned
red', še-tvr-a 'X got a bit drunk' vs da-tvr-a 'X got drunk'.
Further examples of the parallel nuance introduced this time by m o from the same Dictionary are: mo-rbil-d-a (= še-rbil-d-a) 'X softened a
bit' vs da-rbil-d-a 'X softened', mo-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned a little bitter'VERBAl MORPHOlOGY163vs ga-mc'ar-d-a 'X turned bitter', mo-mšav-d-a 'X turned a little sour'
vs da-mžav-d-a 'X turned sour'. Also given under the same rubric are
three more denominal verbs, but this time the preverb is followed by the
Subjective Version vowel and the forms in question are restricted (at least
for the relevant meanings) to the Prešent Sub-Series, a restriction that
does not apply to the earlier examples: mo-i-junc'-eb-s 'X is somewhat
mean', mo-i-sust'-eb-s 'X is somewhat weak', mo-i-did-eb-s 'X is
somewhat big', to which can be added mo-i-k'oč'l-eb-s 'X is somewhat
lame'. Note the same initial sequence of morphemes in the (Serially
unrestricted) verbs of the following expressions: tav-s mo-i-k'at , (?+)uneb-s 'X makes him/herself out to be innocent', a synonym of which is
tav-s mo-i-sa+c'q+1-eb-s <= sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched, miserable'; cf.
tav-s mo-i-m+]in+ar-eb-s 'X pretends to be asleep' <= m + jin + are
'sleeping', tav-s mo-i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb-s 'X pretends to be dead' <=
m+k'vd+ar-i 'dead'. Keeping this same initial sequence, one can use as
the verbal root the name of a town to produce a verb-form meaning
'find/enjoy TOWN'; such verbs are often used in the past and in questions
of the type: ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-soxum-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on
in Sukhum?', ro+gor mo-(Ø-)i-tbilis-e? 'How did you find/enjoy/get on in
Tbilisi?'.
With some Medial verbs mo- has a special function. Medišis typically
take no preverb in any Series, but the addition of mo- to any of the three
Prešent Sub-Series screeves of the relevant Medišis produces expressions
meaning 'come VERBing' (e.g. (i-)mger-i-s 'X sings' => mo-i-mger-i-s 'X
comes singing', t a m a š - o b - s 'X plays' => m o - t a m a š - o b - s 'X comes
playing', t'ir-i-s 'X cries' => mo-t'ir-i-s 'X comes crying', xox-av-s 'X
crawls' => mo-xox-av-s 'X comes crawling', Ht'v-i-s 'X seeks refuge' =>
mo-i-lt'v-i-s 'X comes seeking refuge'). One can sometimes additionally
indicate the prešence of an indirect object recipient of the verbal activity
(usually the emission of some sort of sound) simply adding a Set B affix (e.g.
q'vir-i-s 'X shouts' => mo-q'vir-i-s 'X comes shouting' => mo-h-q'vir-i-s
'X comes after/follows Y shouting (sc. at Y)', q'iv-i-s 'X crows' => moq'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing' => mo-h-q'iv-i-s 'X comes crowing at Y').
For the root -bed- 'dare' the usual preverb is ga- (as in i+s ro+gor
ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e/ga-(Ø-Ø-)m-i-bed-e? 'how did you dare that/dare (do)
that to me?'). If we change the preverb to mo-, we produce a short-hand
way of saying 'dare to come here' (e.g. ro+gor mo-(0-?0-)bed-e? =
mo+svl+a ro+gor ga-(Ø-Ø-)bed-e? 'how did you dare to come here?').
By using še- we produce a short-hand for 'dare to go in', though with an
indirect object attached, the verb means 'dare/deign to do/say something
to someone' (as in:164GEORGIANGRAMMAR

'the woman could not deign to ask anyone to let her spend the night (sc.

'you (will) dare/deign to do/say X/them to Y/them' (cf. the common
expression ro+gor g-e-k'adr-eb-a-t?! 'how can you say/even think of
(saying) such a thing?!').
The preverb mi- is similarly employed with the Prešent Sub-Series
screeves of some Medišis to indicate the opposite orientation (e.g. m i tamaš-ob-s 'X goes playing', mi-k'iv-i-s 'X goes screaming', mi-h-k'ivi-s 'X goes after/follows Y screaming (at Y)').
Consideration of the special functions of da- can begin with the
observation that, where a Medial's activity in the Prešent Sub-Series takes
place not hither or thither but 'all around', then da- is attached (e.g. datamaš-ob-s 'X moves around playing', but in this case when an indirect
object is prešent, the Thematic Suffix alters to give da-s-tama š-eb-s 'X
plays around Y', da-seirn-ob-s 'X walks around', da-k'unt'ruš-ob-s 'X
capers about', da-laklak-ob-s 'X goes around prattling', da-(5'or+aob-s 'X goes around spreading rumours', da-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins around,
works at speed'). When this preverb is used, there is often a hint of its
original directional force 'down' (e.g. da-s-t'rial-eb-s 'X spins/fusses
around/over Y', da-s-t'rp-i-s = da-s-t'rp+ial-eb-s 'X behaves lovingly
over/towards Y', da-h-q'iv-i-s 'X crows down at Y', da-s-t'ir-i-s 'X
looks down and cries over Y', da-gručun-eb-s 'X goes around grunting/X
grunts down over Y', da-h-q'ašq'aš-eb-s 'X (eagle, etc..) barks down at
Y', da-h-q'mu-i-s 'X moos over Y', da-mger-i-s 25 'X sings over Y', which
as a verb with a full paradigm means 'sing to the accompaniment of an
instrument', as shewn by:

da-(?0-)mger-a
PREV-(?3rd.PER-)sing-X(AOR)
'X played the pipe and sang to its accompaniment')
da- may be used in a parallel way with the Prešent Sub-SeriesVERBAl MORPHOlOGY165screeves of non-Medials too (e.g. da-e-tr-ev-a = da-e-xet'-eb-a 'X
wanders aimlessly about', da-a-č'en-eb-s 'X gallops Y (horse) around',
da-a-tr-ev-s 'X drags Y around', da-a-č'rial-eb-s 'X conveys Y (cart)
around creaking', da-a-t'ar-eb-s 'X conveys Y about', da-s-cker-i-s =
da-h-q'ur-eb-s = da-mzer-s 'X looks down upon/over Y', da-i-p'areb-a 'X lurks around like a thief', with which may be compared m o - i p'ar-eb-a 'X comes thieflike' and mi-i-p'ar-eb-a 'X goes thieflike',
though KEGl also quotes a full paradigm for this latter in the šense of
'sneak somewhere').
Perhaps the above-usages of da- might just be subsumed under the
general heading of intensification of the verbal activity, which is often
conveyed by this preverb—an action carried on in more than one direction
might be regarded as an intensification or pluralising of that action.
However, the property of intensification/pluralisation is most clearly seen
when da- substitutes for the normal preverb to underline the plurality of a
Transitive Verb's direct object or an Intransitive Verb's subject. Schmidt
devoted an early article (1957) to this very topic, styling it a South
Caucasian 'Aktionsart'. He quoted a whole list of cases, either elicited or
from KEGl, of da- substituting for other preverbs in cases of plurality
(including instances where the nuance is translateable as 'VERBing to and
from/around' and noting where plurality occasions suppletion of the verbal
root itself), observing that most often da- seems to replace ga- in
Transitive Verbs (e.g. ga-gzavn-i 'you will šend one X' vs da-gzavn-i
'you will šend them', ga-jarcv-av 'you will rob one X' vs da-jarcv-av
'you will rob them', ga-rand-av 'you will plane one X' vs da-rand-av
'you will plane them', ga-bt'q'vn-i 'you will pluck one X' vs da-bt'q'vn-i
'you will pluck them'). Prešented separately were other alternations,
including those for Intransitives (e.g. gada-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow
one X' vs da-q'lap'-av 'you will swallow them', mo-lok'-av = ga-lok'-av
'you will lick one X clean' vs da-lok'-av 'you will lick them clean', m o - h p'ar-av 'you will steal one X from Y' vs da-h-p'ar-av 'you will steal
them from X', mo-k'1-av 'you will kill one X' vs (with change of root!) daxoc-av 'you will kill them', ga-ǰavr-d-eb-a 'X will grow angry' vs daǰavr-d-eb-i-an 'they will grow angry'). Schmidt observed that in addition
to marking the plurality of a direct object, the prešence of da- might
indicate that the verbal activity is applied more than once to the single
object or that the single object ends up in many pieces (e.g. ga-xetk 'you
will split one X' vs da-xetk 'you will split them/one X many times', ga-t'ex
'you will break one X' vs da-t'ex 'you will break them/one X into many
pieces').
gada- may replace a root's normal preverb to indicate that the verbal166GEORGI AN GRAMMARaction is carried out thoroughly or to excess or for a second time, in which
last instance it equates to 're-' (e.g. da-xarǰ-av 'you will spend X/them' =>
gada-xarǰ-av 'you will overspend X/them', da-gl-i 'you will tire X/them'
=> gada-gl-i 'you will overtire X/them', da-a-mlaš-eb 'you will make
X/them (over-)salty' => g a d a - a - m l a š - e b 'you will make X/them
excessively salty/will overstep the mark', da-c'v-av 'you will burn X/them'
=> gada-c'v-av 'you will burn X/them to a cinder', ga-sinǰ-av 'you will
examine X/them' => gada-sinǰ-av 'you will examine thoroughly/re-examine
X/them', mo-xn-av 'you will plough X/them' => gada-xn-av 'you plough
thoroughly/re-plough X/them', da-a-muša-v-eb 'you will work X/them
over' => gada-a-muša-v-eb 'you will re-work X/them', d a - a - r k m - e v
'you will give a name to X/them' => gada-a-rkm-ev 'you will re-name
X/them', i-t'q'v-i 'you will say X/them' => g a d a - t k v - a m 'you will
renounce what you said', i-pikr-eb 'you will think' => gada-i-pikr-eb
'you will change your mind', i-angariš-eb 'you will work out a sum' =>
gada-i-angariå-eb 'you will re-do a sum).
gada- may also indicate the superficiality of the verbal action (e.g
xel-s da-i-ban 'you will wash your hands' => xel-s gada-i-ban 'you will
give your hands a cat-lick', da-a-tval+ier-eb 'you will look over/examine
X/them' => gada-a-tval+ier-eb = tval-s gada-a-vl-eb 'you will give
X/them a cursory inspection').
While not lending any special nuance, the preverb a- is especially
common, though not unique, as the perfectivising exponent for Intransitive
inceptive verbs formed from Medial roots (e.g. i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' => a-lap'arak'-d-eb-i 'you will begin to speak', i-mger-eb 'you
will sing' => a-mger-d-eb-i 'you will start to sing', i-t'ir-eb 'you will cry'
=> a-t'ir-d-eb-i 'you will start to cry').
The preverb c'a- in combination with the Subjective Version vowel is
especially common with Medial roots to indicate the marginal
accomplishment of the verbal action and will be re-prešented at greater
length in the description of the Medials (e.g. with the Medial i-sauzm-eb
'you will have breakfast' => c'a-i-sauzm-eb 'you will snatch a bit of
breakfast' compare the non-Medial č'am 'you (will) eat X/them' => c'a-ič'am 'you snatch a bite to eat').
c'a- may also serve to indicate that the activity affects the end or
edge of something (e.g. mo-s-č'r-i = mo-a-č'r-i 'you will cut X off Y' =>
c'a-a-č'r-i = c'a-s-č'r-i 'you will cut a small piece X off the end of Y',
mo-s-č'am = mo-a-č'am 'you will eat X off Y' => c'a-s-č'am 'you will eat
top/bottom X off Y', mi-a-b-am 'you will tie X to Y' => c'a-a-b-am 'you
will tie X onto the end of Y thereby extending Y', mi-a-c'eb-eb 'you will
glue X onto Y' => c'a-a-c'eb-eb 'you will glue X onto the end of Y therebyVERBAl MORPHOlOGY167extending Y').
There seems to be a roughness or something uncomplimentary involved
when c'a- replaces ga-mo- in the case of ga-mo-a-rtm-ev 'you will
take X off Y' vs c'a-a-rtm-ev 'you will snatch X off Y'.
The preverb c'a-mo- can also indicate the restricted nature of the
verbal activity (e.g. i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' => c'a-mo-c'vim-s 'there
will be a short rainfall', ga-i-zrd-eb-a 'X will grow' => c'a-mo-i-zrd-eba 'X will grow a bit', k'b+il-i a-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to
ache' => k'b+il-i c'a-mo-g-t'k'iv-d-eb-a 'your tooth will start to give
you a little pain'). Note, however, c'a-mo-d'arxl-d-eb-i 'you will turn
beetroot red' <= č'arxal-i 'beetroot'.
c'a-mo- is often found with the Subjective Version vowel, especially
with basically Medial roots, indicating the sudden and swift nature of the
activity (e.g. c'a-mo-i-jax-eb 'you will suddenly shout out', i-q'ep-eb-s
'X will bark' => da-i-q'ep-eb-s 'X will give a bark' => c ' a - m o - i - q ' e p eb-s 'X will suddenly let out a bark'). But this nuance is not limited to
Medial derivatives (e.g. da-i-c'q'-eb 'you will begin X/them' vs c'a-moi-c'q'-eb 'you will suddenly begin X/them', a-i-nt-eb-a 'X will light up' vs
c'a-mo-i-nt-eb-a 'X will suddenly light up').
Perhaps the most interesting case of a special nuance attaching to a
preverb concerns š e - m o - (sometimes just še-). This preverb shews that
the verbal action is committed by an unwilling agent (see Potsxishvili 1969;
Dzhorbenadze 1983:96-97), and not only does še-mo- replace the verb's
normal preverb but the active Transitive Verb is made Intransitive
(passive) and the unwilling agent is reprešented as indirect object of this
Intransitive verb-form, sometimes in association with the e-versioniser and
in other cases with the locative Version-vowel depending on the
intransitive morphology characteristic of that root, as will be explained
later in this chapter (e.g. mo-v-k'1-av 'I shall kill X' => š e - m o - m - a k'vd-eb-a 'I shall unwittingly kill X', which Intransitive is based on m o k'vd-eb-a 'X will die' rather than on mo-i-k'vl-eb-a 'X will be killed';
ga-cvet 'you will wear out X/them' => še-mo-g-a-cvd-eb-a = še-mog-e-plit-eb-a = š e - m o - g - e - x - e v - a = š e - m o - g - e - p x r i c ' - e b - a 'you
will unwittingly wear/tear X/them to rags'; da-a-mt'vr-ev 'you will
shatter X/them' => š m o - g - e - m t ' v r - e v - a = še-mo-g-e-msxvr-ev-a =
še-mo-g-e-pšvn-eb-a 'you will unwittingly shatter X/them'; da-xarǰ-av
'you will spend X/them' => še-mo-g-e-xarǰ-eb-a = še-mo-g-e-č'ameb-a 'you will unwittingly spend X/them'; ga-tl-i 'you will whittle X/them'
=> še-mo-g-e-tl-eb-a 'you will unwittingly whittle X/them'; da-č""r-i 'you
will wound X/them' => še-mo-g-e-č'r-eb-a 'you will unwittingly wound X';
ga-lanjg-av 'you will insult X/them' => še-mo-g-e-lanjg-eb-a 'you will168GEORGI AN GRAMMARunwittingly insult X'; ga-t'ex 'you will break X/them' => še-(mo-)g-at'q'd-eb-a 'you will unwittingly break X/them'; ga-lax-av 'you will beat
up X/them' => še-mo-g-e-lax-eb-a 'you will beat X up without meaning
to'; ga-a-kr-ob 'you will extinguish a light' => åe-mo-g-a-kr-eb-a 'you
will unwittingly extinguish a light').
No mention has yet been made of the alternative forms of some of the
preverbs from the earlier list. In general the variants, each with a
bracketed extra letter, reprešent the older forms of the relevant preverbs.
Occasionally the older form is retained with certain verb-forms, sometimes
both the older and the newer forms will be in use, though there will either
be a difference in meaning or the older form will lend an archaic flavour or
higher style to the form in question.
For ag- we can note that ag+dg+om+a is retained in the šense of
'Easter' whereas the Masdar for 'standing up' today is a-dg-om-a; agk'vec-a indicates 'blessing into the priesthood', whilst a-k'vec-a is today
'shortening (e.g. someone's hair)'; ag+c'er+il+oba is the only word for
'description'. Often forms with the older variant are possible even in the
Prešent Sub-Series (a) for roots never found without this preverb, or (b)
where ag- in the Prešent Sub-Series contrasts with a- elsewhere (e.g. agnišn-av-s 'it means X', ag-ricx-av-s = ag-nusx-av-s 'X enumerates
Y/them', ag-beč'd-av-s 'X leaves behind an imprint of Y', ag-a-gzneb-s = ag-a-nt-eb-s 'X fires/rouses Y/them' vs a-a-gzn-eb-s = a-ant-eb-s 'X will fire/rouse Y/them'). According to the Dictionary of
Morphemes, because of confusion about word-divisions as the older form
was shifting to the newer, the back fricative became attached as part of
the root in a number of cases (such as mi-a-g(+)c'-ev 'you will reach
X/them'—the writer D. K'ldiashvili, who died as late as 1931, used the
original form of the root, as in ra+t'om mi-a-c'-i-a a+m dge-mde?
'why did X survive upto this day?'; in olderGEORGIAN'I confess/
acknowledge' was ag-v-i-a+r-eb, whereas today it is v-a-g(+)i(+)a(+)reb—KEGl has for its entry of 3rd person singular Prešent-Future, Aorist
and Perfect forms: agiarebs, agiara, aguarebia, with the added note in
brackets [and not: agviarebs, ... ugiarebial; V. Topuria and I.
Gigineishvili's 1968 Orthographic Dictionary, on the other hand, gives the
Perfect as: u g i a r e b i a , which can only be analysed as:
(Ø-)ug(+)i(+)a(+)r-eb-i-a, in harmony with the re-interpreted Prešent-Future
form given above).
Similar observations and examples are possible in the case of gan- (e.g.
'hermit' may only be gan+deg+il-i; 'persecution' is gan+d+ev+n+a-, one
way of saying 'X traversed a path' is to say gza ga-(Ø-)i-a+r-a, but with
the alternative root the preverb must be gan-, namely gza gan-(Ø-)vl-o).","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187]"

Thematic Suffix -en
The suffix is not lost but changes to -in for all verbs throughout Series 11.
The conjugation is Weak with 3rd person singular in -a. The exampleverb is 'save':

Thematic Suffix -ev
Apart from the roots -rkm- and -rtm-, verbs in -ev do not totally lose
this suffix but reduce it to -i throughout Series II for their active voice

for the illustrated verb 'destroy':

3.4 Postpositions(tan+d+eb+ul-eb-i)Adpositions inGEORGIANare almost always postpositional. They either
stand as separate words, in which case some of those governing the
Genitive may for stylistic reasons be placed before the noun or
demonstrative pronoun (both in the long form of the Genitive) they govern,
or are attached to their governed (pro)noun; such clitic postpositions are
written here with a hyphen. Postpositions govern a specific case, the most
commonly governed cases being the Genitive and Dative. When an
association with certain elements produces a commonly used adverb, as
seen in some examples from section 3.3, no case-marker appears (e.g.
gušin-c'in 'the day before yesterday'). However, if we wish to build on
this adverb to form the expression for '3 days ago', the Genitive ending is
used before the second occurrence of the postposition (e.g. gušin-c'in-is
c'in).
3.4.1 Postpositions with theNOMINATIVE(saxel+ob+it-i)
The only postposition that can take theNOMINATIVEis -vit 'like, as', and
then this is only possible for consonant-final stems (e.g. xar-i-vit 'like a
bull'), where theNOMINATIVEis an alternative to the Dative, which case
must be used for vowel-final stems.
Nouns can be used in apposition to other nouns or pronouns preceded
by ro+gor+c 'as, like'. Clearly the appositional case will often be the
NOMINATIVE e.g.
č ven
v-šr+om-ob-t
ugl-is
kve+š
we(NOm) lst.PER-toil-TS-PL(PRES) yoke-GEN under
xar-i
bull-NOm
'we toil beneath the yoke like a bull'ro+gor + c
like3.4.2 Postpositions with the Genitive (na+tes+a+ob+it-i)
Clitic postpositions are suffixed to either the short or long form of the
Genitive. Free-standing postpositions take the short form of the Genitive,
though the long form will be used when those than can stand
prepositionally are so placed. In association with personal pronouns, the
interrogative pronouns vin? 'who?' and ra? 'what?' or with demonstrative
pronouns in the plural, the pronominal stem seen in the relevant possessive
adjective is used alone with clitic postpositions, whilst a final -s is today
regularly added when these pronouns are governed by a free-standing70GEORGIANGRAmmARpostposition (e.g. čem-tvis 'for me' vs čem(-s) ga(+)mo 'because of me' <=
čem-i 'my').
- t v i s 'for' (e.g. kal-is(a)-tvis 'for the woman', u č a - s ( a ) - t v i s 'for
Ucha', i-eb-is(a)-tvis 'for the violets', a+m-is(a)-tvis 'for this one', m is-tvis 'for him/her/it', m a - t - t v i s 'for them', i+ma-t-tvis 'for those
(ones)'). See 5.1.5 for its role as a marker of indirect objects.
-gan means 'from' in the sense of:
(a) physical separation from people, e.g.
čven-gan šor+s nu
us-from
far
not(PROH)
'don't go far from us'c'a-x-val
PREV-you-go(FUT)(b) material from which something is made (e.g. x-is(a)-gan 'from/of
wood', r k ' i n - i s ( a ) - g a n 'from/of iron'); (c) source (e.g. šiš-is(a)-gan
'from/out of fear', si+rcxv+il-is(a)-gan 'from/out of shame'). It is the
standard postposition with the verb 'consist of', e.g.
sa+kon+el-i
še-dg-eb-od-a
ert-i
tx-isa-gan
livestock-NOm PREV-consist.of-TS-IMPERF-it
1-AGR goat-GEN-from
da or-i
jrox-isa-gan
and 2-AGR cow-GEN-from
'the livestock consisted of one goat and two cows'
It may also mark the agent with passive verbs, Privative Participles or
masdars (e.g. šen-gan da+u+t'ir+eb+el-i 'unwept for by you', t k v e n - i
ga+mo+gzavn+a me+p-is(a)-gan 'your sending (= being sent) here by
the king').
ga(+)mo, which may not be preposed, states a reason (e.g. s e n - i s
ga(+)mo 'because of disease', i+m-is ga(+)mo 'because of that', m - i s
ga(+)mo 'because of him/her/it').
še+deg+ad, the Adverbial case of the noun še+deg-i 'result', gives us
the pseudo-postposition meaning 'as a result' (e.g. av+ad+m+q'op+ob-is
še+deg+ad 'as a result of illness').
mi+mart (but mo+mart when governing a 1st person pronoun), which
may not be preposed, means '(directed) towards' usually in a non-spatial,
metaphorical sense, e.g.
ara+vitar-i
no-AGRmt'r+ul-i
grjn+ob+a
ara
hostile-AGR feeling(NOm) notm-a-kv-s
I-LV-have-it(PRES)NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY71tkven(-s)/mezobl-is
mi+mart
you.PL(-GEN3 )/neighbour-GEN towards
'I have no hostile feeling towards you/the neighbour'
Synonymous with the preceding postposition is -da+mi, which is the
form used with the personal pronouns (e.g. int'eres-i/si+q'var+ul-i
č e m - d a + m i / š e n - d a + m i / m - i s - d a + m i / m a - t - d a + m i 'interest in/love
towards me/you/X/them'). With ordinary nouns or demonstrative pronouns
the form used is -ad + mi (e.g. int'eres-i/si+jul+v+il-i
kal-eb-isad+mi/a+m-is-ad+mi 'interest in/hatred towards women/this one'). In
OldGEORGIAN-da plus Genitive fulfilled the same role as -tvis, as it still
does in some dialects and as parallel formations regularly do in the other
Kartvelian languages. It is this -da we have in such expressions as
tkven-da sa+u+bed+uro-d 'unfortunately for you', seen in 3.2.5.
garda means 'apart from' (e.g. a+m q'ut-eb-is garda 'apart from
these boxes'). It is often preposed in the phrase garda i+m-isa (= i+mis garda), rom 'apart from that (sc. the fact) that'. It is sometimes found
with the Dative (e.g. a+ma-s garda 'apart from this').
- k ' e n means 'towards' in a spatial, directional sense (e.g.
da+sa+vl+et-is(a)-k'en 'westwards', čven(-s)-k'en 'towards us', m - i s k'en 'towards X').
mier, which may not be preposed, marks the agent with passives (e.g.
v-is mier da-i-c'er-a? 'by whom was it written?', vova-s mier mo-k'lul-i 'killed by Vova').
áe+sa+x+eb, which may not be preposed, means 'about, concerning'
(e.g. r-is áe+sa+x+eb? 'concerning what?', p'olit'ik'-is še+sa+x+eb
'about politics'). Cf. -ze in 3.4.2.
-tana+ve is used with masdars and means 'as soon as' (cf. 5.2.2.1.7.2).
irgvl+iv or gar+še+mo, which may not be preposed, mean 'around'
(e.g. jir-eb-is irgvl+iv/gar+áe+mo 'around the roots').
gare+t, which may not be preposed, means 'outside' (kalak-is gare+t
'outside the town').
gare+še, which is not absolutely excluded from being preposed, means
'without' (e.g. xumr+ob-is gare+še 'without joking', šen(-s) gare+še
'without you' = u-šen-o-d, which is the Adverbial case of the privative
adjective; pul-is gare+še - u-pul-o-d 'without money'). It may also be
used as a synonym for gare+t (e.g. ezo-s gare+áe 'outside the yard').
c'in, which is not preposable, means 'before' either temporally or
spatially (e.g. gada+c+em-is c'in 'before the programme', k'las-is c'in
'in front of the class'—N.B. the lack of any Genitive marker in the common
phrases tval-c'in 'before (one's) eye(s)' and cxvir-c'in 'in front of (one's)72GEORGIANGRAmmARnose'). The variant c'ina+t is restricted to a temporal sense (e.g. xut-i
c'l-is c'in(a+t) '5 years before/ago')—N.B. the expression with the Dative
a+ma-s c'ina+t 'just now, recently'. The variant c'ina+áe is used only in
the spatial sense of 'before' = 'in front' (e.g. k'reb-is c'in(a+Se) 'in front
of the meeting').
uk'an, which is not preposable, means 'behind' (e.g. čem(-s) uk'an
'behind me', sa+tb+ur-is uk'an 'behind the greenhouse'). It is sometimes
used like še+m+deg 'after' (e.g. cot'a xn-is uk'an 'after a little while').
i+k+it, less commonly mi+gma, neither of which is preposable, means
'on that side, beyond'; the former is also used with the Dative (e.g. t'q'is/t'q'e-s i+k+it 'beyond the wood', ok'ean-is mi+gma 'beyond the
ocean').
ga+gma/gada+gma, neither of which may be preposed, also mean
'beyond, on the far side' and are usually used with nouns signifying natural
barriers, like 'river/road/mountain/gorge', not that the two preceding
postpositions are prohibited from appearing with such nouns (e.g. tergis/mt-is
ga(da)+gma/i+k+it/mi+gma
'on the far side of the
Terek/mountain').
a+k+et, less commonly mo+gma, neither of which is preposable, means
'on this side; after, since (temporally)'; the former is also used with the
Dative (e.g. t'q'-is/t'q'e-s a+k+et 'on this side of the wood', ok'ean-is
mo+gma 'on this side of the ocean', m-is-i si+k'vd+il-is a+k+et = m-is
si+k'vd+il-s a+k+et 'after/since X's death').
ga+mo+gma/gad+mo+gma, neither of which may be preposed, also
mean 'on this side of' and are usually used with nouns signifying natural
barriers, though the preceding two postpositions are also permitted in this
context (e.g. terg-is/mt-is
ga+mo+gma/gad+mo+gma/a+k+et/mo+
gma 'on this side of the Terek/mountain').
šfe+m+deg, which is not preposable, means 'after' (e.g. v a x š m - i s
áe+m+deg 'after dinner').
mi+xed+v+it, which is not preposable, means 'according to' (e.g.
mi+g+eb+ul-i azr-is mi+xed+v+it 'according to the received opinion').
When used with the demonstrative pronouns, the pronoun's Genitive ending
is often reinforced by -da (e.g. a+m-is(-da) mi+xed+v+it 'according to
this').
mi + u+xed + av + ad, which is the Adverbial case of the Privative
Participle of the verb meaning 'look to', whose masdar in the Instrumental
case provided the preceding postposition, means 'in spite of'. Governed
personal and demonstrative pronouns are often reinforced by -da (e.g.
mraval-i p'roblem-is mi+u+xed+av+ad = mi+u+xed+av+ad
mraval-i p'roblem-isa 'despite several problems', šen(-s)/šen-da73NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGYm i + u + x e d + a v + a d 'in spite of you', i + m a - t ( - s ) / i + m a - t - d a
mi+u+xed+av+ad 'in spite of those').
gverd+it/gverd+ze, neither of which is preposable, mean 'beside' (e.g.
čven(-s) gverd+it/gverd+ze 'beside us', bič'-is gverd+it/gverd+ze
'beside the boy').
kve+sVkve+v+it, neither of which is preposable, mean 'under­
neath/below'; they are also found with the Dative (e.g. sa + c' + o l is/sa+c'+ol-s kve+á 'underneath the bed', panǰr-is kve+v+it 'below
the window', c'arb-s kve+v+it 'below the eyebrow').
ze+v+it, which is not preposable, means 'above'; it is also found with
the Dative (e.g. panǰr-is ze+v+it 'above the window', c'arb-s ze+v+it
'above the eyebrow').
ga+sc'vr+iv, which is not preposable, means 'along' (e.g. m+din+ar-is
ga+sc'vr+iv 'along the river').
p'ir + da + p'ir, which is not preposable, means 'straight in front,
opposite' (e.g. buxr-is p'ir+da+p'ir 'straight in front of/opposite the
fireplace').
mag+ier(+ad)/mag+ivr+ad/na+cvl+ad, none of which is preposable,
mean 'instead' (e.g. me+p-is
mag+ier(+ad)/mag+ivr+ad/na+cvl+ad
'instead of the king').
c'ina+ag+m+deg, which is not preposable, means 'against' (tkven(-s)
c'ina+ag+m+deg 'against you', t'alg-is c'ina+ag+m+deg cur+v+a
'swimming against the tide').
axlo+s, which is not preposable, means 'near' (e.g. i-is axlo+s 'near
the violet').
It is also used in association with the Dative-taking
postposition -tan (e.g. kal-tan a+s+e axlo+s 'so close (as this) to the
woman').
amara, which is not preposable, means 'possessing/provided only
with/wearing only' (e.g. mart'o+k'a áarvl-is amara 'alone with only (his)
trousers', mo+di+od+a xanǰl-is amara 'X was coming possessed of only
a dagger',
gam-is
p'erang-is amara
še-mo-i-čr-a
night-GEN shirt-GEN
wearing PREV-PREV-PASS-rush.in-X(AOR)
'X rushed in wearing only a night-shirt').
a+na+bar+a 'abandoned to', which looks to be related to (ča-)bareb-a 'entrust(ing), deposit(ing)', e.g.
keto-s
Keto-DATmama
mo-(Ø-)u-k'vd-a,

in the phrase 'abandoned to God', a final -s may be added (viz. gvt-is
a+na+bar+a(+s)).
sa+šua+1+eb+it/me+áv+e+ob+it/me+ox+eb+it/da+xmar+eb+it/
àe+m+c'+e+ob+it/c'q'al+ob+it 'by means of' (e.g. gvt-is sa+šua+l+eb+
it/me+áv+e+ob+it/me+ox+eb+it/da+xmar+eb+it/áe+m+c'+e+ob+it/
c'q'al+ob+it 'by means/ with the help of God'). None is preposable.
mizn+it, which is not preposable, is used with masdars as a non-finite
representation of purpose. Some commentators condemn this usage as a
calque on Russian expressions of purpose with s ceVju (e.g. q'vela-s
mo+t'q'u+eb-is mizn+it 'for the purpose of deceiving everybody').
sc'or+s, which may not be preposed, is used to express the notion 'a
week from' with certain expressions of time (e.g. dge-is sc'or+s 'a week
from today', xval-is sc'or+s 'a week from tomorrow', otx+šabat-is
sc'or+s 'a week from Wednesday').
-(m)ebr is an archaic synonym for -vit. It is still found regularly in
the expression čv+e+ul+eb-isa-mebr 'as is the/X's custom; customarily'.
Cf. čem-ebr 'like me' (= čem-sa-vit, dem-nair-ad, dem-eb+ur-ad,
see 3.9.2 for the last two formations).
3.4.3 Postpositions with the Dative (mi+c+em+it-i)-ši means 'in'. The Dative desinence -s actually disappears before this
postposition for all nouns, for the demonstrative pronouns, and for the
interrogative pronoun ra? 'what?', but it is retained for the 3rd person
singular personal pronoun and in the interrogative vin? 'who?'; for 1st and
2nd person pronouns and for the plural of both the 3rd person personal
pronoun and the demonstrative pronouns the stem of the relevant
possessive adjective is used (e.g. saxl-ši 'in the house', m c x e t a - š i 'in
mtsxeta', a+ma-ši 'in this', maġa-ši 'in that (by you)', i+ma-Si 'in that',
ra-ši? 'in what?', ma-s-ái 'in X', vi-s-äi? 'in whom?', dven-ši 'in/among
us', ma-t-ši 'in/among them', a+ma-t-ši 'in/among these'). When -c 'and,
also, even' is added, the sequence may take the form -ši(+(d)a)-c.
-ze means 'on'. In expressions of comparison it is translated as 'than';
it can also be used as a synonym for še+sa+x+eb 'concerning, about'.
The Dative desinence is present or absent in exactly the same
circumstances as just described for -ši (e.g. sa+xur+av-ze 'on the roof',NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY75mcxeta-ze ra-s amb-ob? 'what are you saying about mtsxeta?', m a - s ze ara+per-s v-amb-ob 'I am saying nothing about it', a+ma-ze 4 didi/u-did-es-i 'bigger than this'). When -c 'and, also, even' is added, the
sequence may take the form -ze(+da)-c.
-tan means 'by, with, at' in the sense of German bei, French chez.
The Dative desinence is lost for consonant-final nouns, but is kept with
vowel-final nouns and the singular of both the 3rd person personal and the
demonstrative pronouns. For 1st and 2nd person pronouns and the plural
of both the 3rd person personal and the demonstrative pronouns the stem
of the possessive adjective is used (e.g. zurab-tan 'by Zurab/at Zurab's',
vova-s-tan 'by Vova/at Vova's', ma-s-tan 'by X/at X's', maġa-s-tan 'by
that one/at that one's place', Sen-tan 'by you/at your place', ma-t-tan 'by
them/at their place', i+ma-t-tan 'by them/at their place'), tana+c is used
adverbially to mean 'at the same time, additionally', and tan alone means
'along, together with', e.g.
cign-i
tan
c'a-(Ø-)i-g-o
book-NOm along PREV-(it-)SV-take-X(AOR)
'X took the book along with him/her/it'
šoris which is not preposable, preferably means 'among' and
secondarily 'between'. 1st and 2nd person pronouns usually end in -s (e.g.
megobr-eb-s šoris 'among/between friends', čven-s šoris 'among/
between us', šen-sa da čem-s áoris 'between you and me', mcxeta-sa
da gor-s Soris 'between mtsxeta and Gori'). The Genitive may also be
used, and Vogt quotes some conjoined phrases in which one conjunct is
Dative, the other Genitive (e.g. k'ap'it'alizm-sa da socializm-is áoris
'between capitalism and socialism').
Sua, which is not preposable, preferably means 'between' and
secondarily 'among', though today this and the previous postposition can be
regarded as interchangeable. 1st and 2nd person pronouns usually end in
-s, and again the Genitive may also be used (e.g. alazan-sa da ior-s Sua
'between the Alazani and I ori (sc. rivers)', jm-is col-sa da tav-is Sua
'between (his) brother's wife(=DAT) and himself(=GEN)\ tkven-s Sua
'between you', ma-t Sua 'between them', maġa-t Sua 'between those (by
you)').
-vit 'like, as' takes the Dative as an alternative to theNOMINATIVEfor
consonant-final nouns and obligatorily in all other cases. In all instances
the Dative is shewn by the long form -sa (e.g. xar-sa-vit 'like a bull',
bavšv-sa-vit 'like a child', xbo-sa-vit 'like a calf', čem-sa-vit 'like me',
ma-sa-vit 'like X', ma-t-sa-vit [sic] 'like them', i+ma-sa-vit 'like that').","[87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"
"NON-VERBAl MORPHOlOGY115Notes
1Historically the -s was the Genitive singular added to a stem ending in -e. For the
analysis see Mač'avariani (1959).
2 It has been suggested that this is an importation from Old Armenian, where the ending
is normal for the Instrumental case of i-stem nouns (e.g. ban-iw 'by/with/through
word'). This hypothesis perhaps accounts for the šense in which the ending -iv is
used inGEORGIAN,but it fails to explain why this borrowing should have capitalised on
the Instrumental desinence only for Armenian i-stem nouns when no such borrowing
seems to have taken place from the more common Armenian a-stems (e.g. a m - a w
'by/with/through year'; Yisous ašakert-aw-k h -n iwr-ov-k h gnac h Jesus(NOM)
disciple-INST-Pl-the
his-INST-Pl
he.departed 'Jesus left with his disciples'), unless
k'vla+v 'again' is to be so analysed. The only alternative explanation I have seen
supposes that originally the particle -ve was suffixed to the citation-form of the
adjective or participle and that in time the word-final e-vowel was lost by apocope.
This proposal, however, as far as I can see, completely fails to account for the
meaning of the forms in -iv.
3 Or Dative perhaps?
4 vidre (cf. 5.2.3.1) may also be used with the object of comparison, which in such
instances stands in the same case as the entity with which it is being compared (e.g.
i+s upro did-i-a vidre e+s that(NOM) more big-NOM-is than this(NOM 'that one is
bigger than this one').
5 Discussing a parallel phenomenon in Mingrelian, namely net'e go-m-o-k'et-eb-apu-ni =GEORGIANnet'avi (rom (- -ni)) ga-m-a-k'et-eb-in-a 'Would that X
made/were to make me do it', K'iziria (1982:89) comments: 'the trivalent verb has
become bivalent; as subject is the noun placed in the Dative.' In other words, he
views the pronominal element - m - , which correlates with a notionally Dative 1st
person singular pronoun outside the verb (here unexpressed), as the subject. I find
this a rather extreme analysis in view of the fact that surely we may simply add to the
Mingrelian g o r o n t - k (and I suspect g m e r t - m a to theGEORGIAN)'God-ERG'
(historically speaking at least this is the Ergative case in Mingrelian) to make explicit
the true subject that is left understood in most cases, cf. the followingGEORGIAN
phrase with this subject actually prešent alongside the Aorist Indicative gmert-ma
î?0-)g-i-švel-a, which expresses the wish 'May God help you!'. Tuite (1991.150)
accepts K'iziria's view in his discussion of theGEORGIANphenomenon.
6 Cf. the use of -u plus an indicative verb in Svan today. See also 5.2.2.1.1.
7 An exact parallel exists in Mingrelian g-a-lu-ap-u-k =GEORGIANg-e-vl-eb-i, from
which the Adverbial case of the Past Participle is g o - l u - a p - i r - o , as in the
expression skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o čkim-i dud-i 'may my head be your encircled',
so that skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o is used much likeGEORGIANg-e-na+cva(l-e), cf. also
kә-go-r-lu-ap-e-d-a-k! =GEORGIANäe-mo-g-vl-eb-od-e! 'may I encircle you!'.
In Abkhaz we s-wә-k'ә+x+әa-x[a]-aa+yt' 'may I encircle you(MASC)' or 5-wәk'ә+x+sa-w+p' 'I am your(MASC) encircler = darling', cf. yә-wә-x-sa s-a-g[a]ša+yt' 'let what may befall you(MASC) carry me off!': if one were to address these
expressions to a woman, the - w ә - would be replaced by - b ә - . N.B. the underlined
sibilant reprešents retroflex articulation.
8 Aorist i-jr-a, Perfect Jr-ul-a. Cf. mic'+is-jvr+a 'earthquake'.
9 Presumably the suffix is analysable as the posposition -tan, here though governing the
Genitive, plus the adjective-formant -a; when used nominally the Genitive is in -a-s.
10 As a general term of address we have the Vocative, as in: s'en, m a v a n - o ,
m+k'itx+a+oba m-i-čuk-eb-i-a šen-tvis you(VOC) man-VOC

"VERBAl MORPHOlOGY4234.9.1 Masdar (masdar-i)
This Arabic term is generally used to describe the verbal noun in
preference to Infinitive (sa+c'q'+is-i), as syntactically the formation
behaves like a noun rather than a verb, such that the object of a
Transitive Verb surfaces in the Genitive (just like any adnominal Genitive
qualifier of another noun)—one might equally well use the term 'gerund'.
OldGEORGIANdid possess an infinitive, which could use either of the direct
object cases (viz. the Nominative and Dative) to mark a Transitive Verb's
direct object (see Hewitt 1983b), and formally it was the Adverbial c a š
form of the Masdar.
The formation of the Masdar for Transitive and Intransitive Verbs is
largely straightforward. Where a root exists in both a Transitive and an
Intransitive guise, there is usually only one shared Masdar, so that dabrun-eb-a is the Masdar for both Transitive (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-brun-eb 'you
(will) return X/them' and Intransitive (da-)(Ø-)brun-d-eb-i 'you (will)
return', e.g.
c'ign-is
da+brun+eb-isa-s
k'ar-ze xma+magl-a
book-GEN returning(MASD)-GEN-DAT door-on loud-ADV
da-(Ø-?Ø-)a-k'ak'+un-e
PREV-(you-?3rd.PER-)lV/NV-knock-AOR.INDI C(=I MPER)
'when returning the book knock loudly on the door'
vs da+brun+eb-isa-s cot'a me-c
(Ø-Ø-)m-i-c'il+ad-e
'when
returning set aside a bit [sc. u+k'vd+av+eb-is c'q'al-i = water of
immortalityj for me too'). A few Intransitives, however, have a separate,
special formation. Where a root normally combines with a preverb in the
perfective screeves, it is usually the case that the Masdar may be formed
with or without the relevant preverb depending on the aspect required (viz.
imperfective without preverb vs perfective with it), though it is not
uncommon to come across a sequence of Masdars dependent upon one and
the same verb where some are with preverb whilst others are preverbless,
which suggests that for some preverb-root combinations at least there
might be a reluctance to drop the preverb, and in general one has the
impression that preverbless Masdars are less common, unless they have
been grammaticalised to function as a kind of abstract noun. Indeed, even
preverbal Masdars may function in this way too (consider variations on the
root-Thematic Suffix stem -c-em- for the verb 'give' such as: mi-c-em-a
'giving' => a-g-eb=mi-c-em-a 'commerce, trade (lit. taking up=giving)',
gada-c-em-a 'handing over; broadcast', g a - m o - c - e m - a 'publishing;424GEORGIANGRAMMARpublication', da-c-em-a 'falling down; decline'). Is it accidental that two
of the formants for abstract nouns inGEORGIAN,namely -eba and -oba,
are also found (albeit analysed as -eb-a/-ob-a) in the Masdars of verbs
in -eb and -ob respectively? These formants are also frequently found
building abstract nouns from the Past Participle (e.g. (5a-c-m-ul-oba
'dress', g a - m o - s a x - u l - e b a = g a - m o - x a t ' - u l - e b a
'expression,
reprešentation', cvl-il-eba 'change'). As examples of preverbless vs
preverbal Masdars consider (da-)c'er-a 'writing' in the following: ar v(Ø-)i-c-i leks-eb-is c'er-a 'I don't know how to write verses' vs:

'we should teach children reading and writing in such a way that they
be able both to understand what they have read and to write what they
have been told'.
The Masdar of Transitive and Intransitive Verbs ends in -a, and the
Masdar then declines like any regular a-final noun (the Genitive being in
-is). The general structure of such Masdars is: (Preverb+)ROOT+(Thematic
Suffix+)-a, one Thematic Suffix being lost, namely -i; Causatives retain
either the simplex - i n - or the complex -ev+in- (plus any complete, or
remnant of, Thematic Suffix that stands between root and Causativeformant in finite forms) before the Thematic Suffix -eb. For changes
affecting any sub-type (such as the occasional appearance of an intrusive
- n - immediately before the Masdar-formant) see below, and for the
Indirect Verbs, where it is often impossible to point to a verbal noun other
than the associated abstract noun, see 4.7.4.
Sometimes a verb and its direct object are viewed as forming such a
close bond that the stem of the direct object is found fused with the
Masdar (e.g. from mxar-s (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-č'er 1 6 9
'you (will) support
X/them (lit. grip the shoulder for X/them)' we have mxar-da-č'er-a
'support' as in lenin's slogan ara+vit+ar-i mxar-da-č'er-a dro+eb+it
m+tav+r+oba-s 'no support to the provisional government'; from xaz-sVERBAl MORPHOlOGY425(ga-XØ-Ø-Ø-)u-sv-am 'you (will) stress (lit. place a line along) X/them'
we have xaz-ga-s-m-a 'stress, emphasis' 17Ø ); indeed, this fusion is also
found in other non-finite forms (e.g. mxar-da-m-č'er-i 1 7 1
the Active
Participle 'supporter' and x a z - g a - s - m - u l - i the Past Participle
'emphasised'. These forms are not to be equated with those compounds
incorporating the Masdar -q'-op-a of the old root -q'(av)- 'do, make'
such as u+gul+eb+el-q'-op-a 'neglecting, ignore, rejecting', for in such
compounds the nominal component is always so written, even in finite
forms, functioning structurally almost like a permanent preverb (e.g. brjeni me+p+e
xalx-is
ga+mo+cd+il+eba-s
ar
u+gul+eb+el(Ø-)q'-op-s 'a wise sovereign does not ignore the experience of the
people' => Aorist brjen-ma me+p+e-m xalx-is ga+mo+cd+il+eba ar
u+gul+eb+el-(Ø-)q'+o).
Thematic Suffix -eb
(ga-)k'et-eb-a 'making/doing, being made/done', (ga-)k'et-eb-in-eb-a
'getting someone to do something, getting something done', (ga-)tetr-eb-a
'whitening, turning white', da-sc'r-eb-a 'making attend, attending,
managing to do something before someone', ga-g-eb-a 'opening' (N.B. p'iris g-eb-in-eb-a 'vomiting'), mo-gvar-eb-a 'arranging', ( m o - ) x e r x eb-a 'managing', p'asux-is g-eb-a 'taking responsibility' <= p'asux-s (ØØ-)a-g-eb 'do (will) you take responsibility', (a-)šen-eb-a 'building, being
built' (cf. šen-oba 'building (as an object)'), da-maxinj-eb-a 'distorting,
distortion', ga-marjv-eb-a 'being victorious, victory' vs ga+marj+oba
(-t)l 'Hello!' (with the response ga-(Ø-)g-i-marj-o-s/t!, which literally
means 'may X [Godj grant you victory!'), garda-cval-eb-a 'passing away'
is used even though the verb garda-i-cvl-eb-a 'X will pass away' is the
Intransitive of a Transitive with Thematic Suffix -i, which would be
expected to produce garda-cvl-a, which is normally used with the
meaning 'changing, being changed' as a synonym for š c v l - a , though in
the Pshav dialect it may indeed mean 'passing away';
Root Verbs
The masdar-formant is added directly to the root of Root Verbs, which
never alter any radical -e—, there are at least two Root Verbs, however,
which both change the root and then have a markerless Intransitive
structure, keeping this altered root for their Intransitive
Masdar and
adding between root and masdar-formant the special Thematic Suffix
- o m - , which in fact appears with a number of roots whose
Intransitive/passive is of the markerless variety, as we shall see.
Examples: (ga-)c'mend-a 'writing', (mo-)zel-a 'kneading', (da-)č'er-a426GEORGIANGRAMMAR'catching, arresting', (mo-)ksov-a 'knitting', (ga-)pxek'-a 'scraping',

(Intrans.)'—N.B. garda-t'ex-a 'break(ing) through', (ga-)cvet-a 'wearing

(gada-)(Ø-Ø-)c'q'vet' 'you (will) decide X/them' and (gada-)c'q'd-eb-a
'it is being/will be decided';
Thematic Suffix -en
da-dg-en-a 'promulgating/passing (law), establishing (text), appointing' <=

The vowel is lost from the Thematic Suffix. Roots ending in one of the
sonants -1/n/r which slot the remaining labio-dental inside the root in the
Intransitive screeves of Series I do so in the Masdar; if the root should
end in -v, one of the now contiguous labio-dentals is dropped (e.g.

'trusting, trust', (da-/mo-/mi-)nd-ob-a 'entrusting';
Thematic Suffix -am
The vocalic component of the Thematic Suffix is lost causing any root-final
-v to be lost (e.g. (da-)b-m-a 'tying', s-m-a 'drinking', ( d a - ) s - m - a
'seating (singularity), putting (Pl.)nctuation-mark)', (da-)sx-m-a 'pouring;

ga-q'-op-a 'splitting'.
Intransitive Verbs with no Transitive Counterparts
Here again we find the Thematic Suffix - o m - being used; on the other
hand, some roots take the Thematic Suffix -ol-. From (mo-)(Ø-)k'vd-ebi 'you (will) die' we have (mo-)k'vd-om-a 'dying' (cf. si-k'vd-il-i 'death');
from (mi-)(Ø-)h-qV-eb-i 'you (will) follow X/them thither' we have mi-q'ol-a (with a variety of preverbs for different directionality, though mo-q'ol-a might also means 'relating (story)'); from (ga-)(Ø-)jvr-eb-i 'you (will)
squeeze/sneak out' we have (ga-)jr-om-a (with a variety of preverbs
possible); from (ga-)(Ø-)jg-eb-i 'you (will) eat to satiety' we have
(ga-)jg-om-a, which is not to be confused with (ga-)jg-ol-a 'leading the
way, supervising' from (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)u-)g-eb-i 'you (will) lead the way for
X/them'; from (ga-)(Ø-)sxlt'-eb-i 'you (will) shoot/spring off' we have
(ga-)sxlt'-om-a; from (ga-)(Ø-)sk'd-eb-i 'you (will) burst' we have
(ga-)sk'd-om-a 'bursting'; from (Ø-)i-lt'v-i (older (Ø-)i-vlt'-i) 'you take
flight, seek refuge' we have lt'-ol-v-a (cf. lt'-ol-v-il-i 'exile, refugee').
Verbs in -ul-ob
A number of these verbs shew the intrusive - n - in their Masdars, from
which the elements -ul-ob are (usually) missing. Examples:
For 'asking/reading' we have k'itx-v-a, with äe-k'itx-v-a possible for
'asking' and c'a-k'itx-v-a possible for 'reading' (cf. c , er-a=k , itx-v-a
'reading and writing'); also there is mo-k'itx-v-a 'regards, greetings', amo-k'itx-v-a 'deciphering', gan-k'itx-v-a 'judgment, pitying, tolerance',
da-k'itx-v-a 'interrogating, interrogation';
For 'buying' there is q'id-v-a vs ga-q'id-v-a 'selling';
sesx-eb-a is used both in the šense of 'borrowing' and 'lending';
For 'asking for, requesting' we have txov-(n-)a, which regularly
contains the nasal; mo-txov-n-a is 'demand(ing)'; for 'sacking' there is datxov-n-a; the only meaning given by KEGl for txov-eb-a is 'lending'
(correlating with (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-txov-eb 'you (will) lend X/them to Y/them
temporarily', leaving the nominal equivalent of (Ø-Ø-)i-txov-eb 'you (will)
borrow X/them for a while' in some doubt); ga-txov-eb-a is 'marrying off
(woman), getting wed (for a woman)'; and ga-mo-txov-eb-a is 'getting
someone to take leave of/taking leave of';VERBAl MORPHOlOGY429For 'finding, acquiring (by search)' we have šov-n-a-,
For 'finding, acquiring (by accident)' we have p'ov-n-a;
For 'increasing in size' there is mat'-eb-a;
For 'decreasing' there is k'l-eb-a;
From (Ø-Ø-)k'adr-ul-ob 'you do/say something unworthy' we have a
Masdar retaining the final sequence of morphemes, namely k'adr-ul-ob-a,
whilst from (Ø-Ø-)h-k'adr-eb 'you will do/say something unworthy to
X/them' there is k'adr-eb-a;
For 'praying, prayer' we have loc-v-a.
Medial Verbs
There is considerable fluctuation, and the formation is straightforward for
only the first three sub-groups, which are the derived Medials: the Masdar
for Medials of sub-group 1 and for most of sub-group 2 is in -ob-a, whilst
that for verbs in sub-group 3 is in -a-ob-a (e.g. c e l k - o b - a 'being
naughty', sadil-ob-a 'lunching', gor-a-ob-a 'rolling around'). Elsewhere a
number of different patterns come into play. 'Expressives' with the
Thematic Suffix -eb in the Prešent Sub-Series lose this suffix and have
their Masdars in -i (e.g. zanzar-i 'rattling', bzr+ial-i 'buzzing', bub+un-i
'bellowing', k'ank'al-i 'shaking'); indeed, verbs containing the formant
+ial- in general have their Masdar in +ial-i (e.g. sr+ial-i 'slipping');
'expressives' in -av form their Masdars normally for verbs with this
Thematic Suffix (e.g. bod-v-a 'talking deleriously', gmin-v-a 'moaning');
those in -i in the Prešent Sub-Series either have Masdars in —il—i (e.g.
bzu-il-i 'buzzing', c'k'mu-il-i 'whining', bgav-il-i 'bleating', k'iv-il-i
'screeching', živ-il-i 'twittering', zmu-il-i 'mooing', k'nav-il-i 'mewing') or
employ either -ol-a or -om-a (e.g. trt-ol-a 'shuddering', k'rt-om-a
'shivering'); from gr-en-s 'it growls' we have gr-en-a 'growling' (other
Mediais in -en- also behave normally for verbs of this type, such as st'ven-a 'whistling', pr-en-a 'flying'). Most Mediais in sub-group 7 are in -eb
or -av; the latter behave normally for verbs of this type (e.g. bobg-v-a
'crawling', cur-v-a 'swimming'), whilst those in -eb lose this suffix and use
just -i (e.g. b a r b a c - i 'reeling', č a n č a l - i 'dawdling', g o g m a n - i
'pattering')—additionally there are such forms as xt'-om-a 'jumping', k r ol-a 'flying', r b - e n - a / s i - r b - i l - i 'running', seirn-ob-a 'going for a
walk/stroll' (vs si-ar-ul-i 'walking'). For the weather-expressions of sub-43ØGEORGIANGRAMMARgroup 8 we have: k u x - i l - i = g r g v i n - v - a = grux + u n - i = č'ek-a
'thunder(ing)', el-v-a 'lightning', tov-a 'snowing' (vs tov-l-i 'snow'),
rižraž-i 'dawn', kr-ol-a = da-ber-v-a 'blowing', šxap'+un-i 'splash(ing)',
c'vim-a 'rain(ing)', q'in-v-a 'freezing', tkor-v-a = cr-a = žinžgvl-a
'light rain(ing)'. For the residuals of sub-group 9 there are certain
tendencies: verbs in -eb- tend to keep this suffix and behave normally (e.g.
mo+km+ed-eb-a 'functioning', kadag-eb-a 'preaching', BuT zozin-i
'working slowly', t'r+ial-i 'spinning'); those in -(a-)ob- tend to keep the
suffix and add the typical -a, but occasionally the -ob becomes -eb (e.g.
muäa-ob-a 'working, work', bobokr-ob-a 'behaving restlessly/excitedly',
kan-a-ob-a 'swinging', tamaš-ob-a 'playing; game' vs tamaä-i 'game',
nadir-ob-a 'hunting' vs nadir-i 'prey', xma+ur-ob-a 'making noise;
noise' vs xma+ur-i 'noise', BuT xmar-eb-a 'using', cxovr-eb-a 'living,
life', c'val-eb-a 'being in torment; trial, torture', and pikr-i 'thinking,
thought'); Root Verbs tends to be normal (e.g. žger-a 'sounding', q'ep-a
'barking', BuT dug-il-i 'boiling', c'ux-il-i 'being unhappy; unhappiness');
roots in -i tend to use —il—i (e.g. t'ir-il-i 'crying', t'q'u-il-i 'lying, lie', puil-i '(dough-)rising', čiv-il-i 'complaining' vs sa-čiv-ar-i 'complaint', BuT
mger-a 'singing', though alongside Prešent (Ø-)mger-i there is (Ø-?Ø-)imger 'you sing', vs si-mger-a 'song');
(Ø-)i-brjv-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-brj-ol-eb
'you (will) fight' has brj-ol-a 'fight(ing)', and
(Ø-)i-svr-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-sr-oleb 'you (will) shoot' has sr-ol-a 'shooting, shot'
4.9.2 Active Participle
The obligatory exponent of this participle is the prefix m - , which
immediately precedes the root, following any preverb(s) that may be
prešent—for the role of this prefix in derivational morphology see 3.9.13.9.2. It is often accompanied by the suffix -el (occasionally -al). Many
Medials employ a variety of other suffixes, and regularly also place a
vowel after the nasal prefix—special attention should be paid to whether
or not the vowel in any suffixal component, particularly -el, syncopates in
this or any other type of participle (the prešence of the preverb perhaps
causing syncope); a syncopating vowel is indicated below by a macron
under the relevant component (e.g. m-c'mend-(el-)i vs ga-m-c'mend(el-)i from (ga-)c'mend-a 'cleaning'). The vowel - a - is a common
accompaniment to the nasal prefix, even with some non-Medial Verbs with
Thematic Suffix -eb; if one recalls that most verbs in -eb normally take
the a-versioniser, one cannot help wondering whether there might not be
some connection between versioniser and the a-vowel in this participial
prefix m a - , which suspicion is supported by the following interestingVERBAl MORPHOlOGY431example (from literary Georgia 1st June 199Ø p.5):

'to the sound-system reprešented in the lending alphabet they contrast

where m(?+)a-sesx-eb-el-i 'lending' relates to the finite form with aversioniser (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sesx-eb 'you (will) lend X/them to Y/them',
whereas m - s e s x - e b - e l - i 'borrowing' relates to the finite form with
Subjective Version (Ø-Ø-)i-sesx-eb 'you will borrow X/them'.
The Active Participle indicates the performer of the verbal action and
is not limited to any particular tense, which is why the title 'Prešent
Participle' is somewhat inappropriate (e.g. (Ø-)i-p'ov-a tav+is-i ga-mzrd-el-i k'oč'l-i irem-i 'he found the lame deer that had reared him (lit.
his own tav+is-i rearing ga-m-zrd-el-i)'; šen-i mo-m-rjul-eb-el-i-c
g a - m o - č n - d - e b - a 'there will also appear someone who will set you on
the right path' 175 ; e+s g-a-xl-av-t čem-1 ojax-is m-rš-en-el-i/marč-en-al/e_l-i 'this is the person who sustains my family', m - g o r - a v
kva-s xavs-i ar mo-(Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a 'a rolling stone gathers no moss').
Some preverbless Active Participles are rather used to indicate a person's
profession as against the full participial force of their preverbal
counterparts (e.g. panjr-is m-c'mend-(el-)i 'window-cleaner', m - k ' e r av-i 'seamstress' vs pex+sa+c+m+1-is še-m-k'er-av-i sa+amkr+oeb-i 'footwear-stitching associations/guilds'), and in many cases they are
used in nominal function (e.g. m - s - m - e l - i 'drinker', m - s m - e n - e l - i
'listener' vs ( m o - ) m - s m - e n - i 'listening', ( t ' e l e - ) m a - q ' u r - e b - e l - i
'(tele-)viewer'). Where a root has both Transitive and Intransitive
paradigms, the Active Participle has only a Transitive šense—in the case
of (ga-)zrd-a 'rearing, growing up' there exists alongside the Active gam-zrd-el-i, seen above, the special m-zard-i which correlates with the
Intransitive paradigm (e.g. m-zard-i k'adr-eb-i 'growing/increasing
cadres', or from Stalin: cxovr+eba-ši m u d a m a+r+s+eb-ob-s m zard-i da mo-ma-k'vd-av-i 'in life there ever exist those who are
growing and those who are dying', a clear example of singular for plural).
Abstract nouns in -oba based on this participle are common (e.g. p'asuxis-m-g-eb-1-oba 'responsibility').","[441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450]"

78GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
One meets the occasional example (and not infrequently in the works of Vazha
Pshavela) where, in place of the regular expansion in -od- plus Imperfect Indicative
or Prešent Subjunctive endings, the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive of bipersonal
Intransitives are formed after the pattern of monopersonal Intransitives, i.e. by the
addition of the Aorist Indicative or Aorist Subjunctive respectively of the copula.
For example, take the Indirect Verb (and Indirect Verbs are formally identical to
bipersonal Intransitives in Series III) in romel-sa-c še+u+jl+eb+el-i-a e+s
si+t'q'v-eb-i da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-i-q'+o 'who it is impossible to have forgotten these
words' (instead of da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-od-a ); instead of ar m-a-xs+ov-s vin+me
gverd-ze mo-m-jd-om-od-e-s
'I don't recall anyone sitting down beside me' one
may hear the III rd Subjunctive formed as m o - m - j d - o m - i - q ' - o - s . An example is
even available of a monopersonal Perfect replacing the expected bipersonal form: it
is from the now defunct Paris-basedGEORGIANjournal 'šentinel' (No. 29, 1992, p.6Ø):
kart+ul-i p'resa a+m gir+s+še+sa+nišn+av mo+vl+en+a-s ar g a - m o x m a + u r - e b - u l - a 'theGEORGIANpress has not responded to this significant
phenomenon' (in place of the 'correct' ga-mo-(Ø-)xma+ur-eb-i-a ).
KEGl quotes an alternative ending, namely -ev-i(-t) , when the subject is 1st or 2nd
person.
Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would respectively be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-vi-v-a+r-t, da-(Ø-Ø-)xoc-v-i-x-a+r-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-v-i-an
Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(ØØ-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen
This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)bad-eb-od-e-t
'may
you(Pl.) be born to X/them'.
This phonetic form may also mean 'may I/we be born to you(Pl.)' or 'may we be born
to you'.
This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)mal-od-e-t
'may you(Pl.)
hide from X/them'.
This form may also mean 'may I /we stick to you(Pl.)' or 'may we stick to you'.
Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-e-t,
da-(ØØ-)xoc-od-e-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen.
This is short for magalit-ad 'for example', and I simply give here a possible fIIIer
just to offer a flavour of the construction.
Though this is 'regular' insofar as the form is bipersonal, since the Masdar is g a xir-v-a , one would have expected this bipersonal form to be ga-g-xir-v-i-a,
seemingly unattested according to both KEGl and Tschenkčli's dictionary.
N.B. Tschenkčli offers a choice for the participial base of such forms by prešenting a
bracketed element, viz. ga-(Ø-)xir-(eb-)ul-x-a+r .
E.g. ar-c c'in c'a-(?Ø-)e-čr-eb-a, ar-c uk'an ča-mo-dg-eb-a
'X will neither
push himself forward nor step back'.
As in this example: i+ma-s ver v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i, rom šuxart-i srul+i+ad gark'v-e-ul-i-q'-o-s
xan-is (resp.
haes) p'repiks-eb-ad
xmar+eb-is
sa+k'itx-Si 'I shan't be able to say that Schuchardt gained a complete understanding
of the question of the use as prefixes of xan (or hae)'.
As in: čv+e+ul+eba-d m-a-kv-s mo+u+mzad+eb+1-ad ar-sad c'a-v-(?Ø-)ečxir-o 'I have the practice of not getting involved anywhere unprepared'.
An interesting example of the use of such a structurally unmotivated -eb to create a
formal distinction in Series III not found elsewhere in the paradigms is seen in the
case of š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' - e b - i - x - a + r
'you apparently went in exile to place X and
took refuge there', which has Prešent-Future (s'e-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xvec , -eb-i
and Aorist
( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e . These Series I and II forms are also used in the šense of
'you (will) beseech X/them', which verb then has the Perfect š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' + n - i - x a+r; this is based on the Masdar ( š ) x v e c ' + n - a 'beseeching; taking refuge', which
would be expected to underlie Series III for the latter of its šenses too. In the caseVERBAl MORPHOlOGY7980

96511of (áe-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xizn-eb-i 'you (will) take refuge in X' (Masdar še-xizvn-a) KEGL
gives the Perfect as še-(Ø-Ø-)xizvn-i-x-a+r , and yet in the illustrations appended
to the relevant entry we find an example of the Pluperfect from Tedo Razik'ashvili
shewing the unmotivated -eb again, viz. bosl-eb-sa da sa+bj+1-eb-s še-(Ø-)
x i z n - e b - o d - n e n 'they had taken refuge in the animal- and grain-barns'.
There can be no doubt about this: KEGL gives as one synonym for (da-)(Ø-)i-c'okeb-a the (transitive) verb-phrase muxl-s (mo-)(Ø-)i-q'r-i-s , where muxl-i = 'knee'
and the verb means 'bend'. Thus, the example arčil-i giorg-is login-tan dačok-il-i-q'+o 'Archil had knelt down at the bed of Giorgi' could be paraphrased as
arčil-s...muxl-i mo-(Ø-)e-q'ar-a. In voluntary buckling of the knees is expressed
by the bipersonal intransitive verb seen in: vin-me-s muxl-i (mo-)(Ø-)e-č'r-eba/Amo-)(Ø-)e-k'vet-eb-a, literally 'the knee is/will be cut//sliced for someone'.
For my review see Hewitt (1983a).
There are two types of exception: (i) Medials which have no Future Sub-Series but
which would have employed this combination of affixes to form the non-existent
screeves, had they existed, and (ii) a small number of irregular Medials which use
only the prefix i- to form the Future Sub-Series.
Taking an example like the following from Literary Georgia (18 Nov 1988, p. 15): c ' a val da šv+il-eb-sa-c da-v-(Ø-)xoc-av, tav-s ar v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb
'I shall go
and kill (my) children; I shall not allow myself to live', we assume tav-s v-(Ø-)icocxl-eb 'I shall allow myself to live' became v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb 'I shall be/remain
alive'.
There are a number of examples where a Series 111 screeve of some Medial is
presented (sc. other than in actual citations from literature) at different places in the
8-volume KEGL, now with the nasal, now without it.
This is the ceremony when, during the lying-in-state at home in the days before the
funeral, visitors come to pay their respects by ritualistic weeping over the corpse.
Some Medials in -av produce their Perfects like normal Transitive Verbs in -av (e.g.
(Ø-)bobg-av = (Ø-)bordg-av = (Ø-)xox-av 'you crawl' have Perfects g - i - b o b g a v - s = g-i-bordg-av-s = g-i-xox-av-s, and yet (Ø-)čoč-av 'you crawl' has the
Perfect g-i-čoč-(?n-)-a!
Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: varaud-ad a+r-i-s 'it is as a supposition'
or s a - v a r a u d - o - a 'it is a matter for supposition'.
Cf. the synonym based on a cognate form: sa-grjn-ob-i-a 'it is perceptible'.
Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: na-gul+is+xm-ev-i-a 'it is meant' or s a gul+is+xm-eb-el-i-a 'it is to be meant'.
Wherever this o-vowel is absent in the paradigm, the labio-dental is restored, as in
the Future (?Ø-)i-gor-av-eb-s 'X will roll around'.
This sort of verb, discussed under 2.5 with reference to sound-symbolism, is a typical
member of the Medial class.
There is also (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'X brings (will bring) rain' (e.g. k a r - i guria-ši
xšir-ad (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'the wind often brings rain to Guria').
With Objective Version we have ši+mš+il-it gul-i m-i-c'ux-s 'my heart is heavy
through hunger', or, from the inceptive, kal-s gul-i (Ø-)u-c'ux-d-eb-od-a
'the
woman's heart was turning sad'.
For both m o - c u r - a v - s and m i - c u r - a v - s there is a full set of paradigms, so that
the meanings respectively are 'X swims (will swim) over here' and 'X swims (will swim)
over there' (=> Aorist m o - / m i - c u r - a => Perfect mo-/mi-(Ø-)u-cur-av-s ).
Note a cognate synonym formed as a bipersonal (but monovalent) Intransitive Verb,
viz. da-(?Ø-)e-xet'-eb-a.
Only the form with indirect object is quoted by KEGL when the preverb is da-.
Note the shift of Thematic Suffix from -ob without indirect object to -eb here. The
verb may be used as in the expression av+ad+m+q'+op-is t'uč-eb-s gim+il-i da-512GEORGI AN GRAMMARs-tamaS-eb-d-a = ga-mo-h-k'rt-od-a 'a smile was playing around the lips of the
sick person'.
97 Note that the preverb here is not in the Prešent Sub-Series.
98 Such formations are not limited to Medials. Consider: c ' a - ( Ø - Ø - ) i - č ' 'you will
have a bite of something to eat'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-loc-av 'you will say a little prayer';
c'a-i-t'rus-eb-a 'X will get a bit scorched'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)in-eb 'vou will snatch a
bit of sleep'; c'a-i-nam-eb-a 'X will get a bit wet with dew'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xemseb = š ( Ø - ) n a q ' r - d - e b - i 'you will snatch a bite of food'.
99 Cf. the unmarked Intransitive Verb (da-)prtx-eb-i 'you (will) take fright' <= (da-)(ØØ-)a-prtx-ob 'you (will) alarm X/them' or, with ga- as an alternative preverb, 'you
(will) frighten and put to flight'. With this compare (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-prtx+il-eb 'you
(will) warn X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)u-prtx+il-d-eb-i 'you (will) be wary of X/them'
or 'you (will) treat X/them with care'.
100 E.g. delegat'-eb-i si+am+ovn+eb-it (Ø-)p'asux-ob-en q'ovel+gvar t'q'u+ilsa da mo+čven+eb+it še+k'itx+v-eb-s 'the delegates provide answers with
pleasure to every kind of lie and specious question'.
101 Also the indirect object may be the possessor of the subject (e.g. luarsab-s saxe
mudam (Ø-)u-cin-od-a 'luarsab's face was always laughing').
102 Cf. bed-i g-i-gim-i-s 'fate smiles on you' (vs bed-i (?Ø-)g-i-muxtl-eb-s 'fate lets
(will let) you down').
103 Cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-c , od-eb
-tan 'you (will) issue a call/summons to X/them
to Y', not to be confused with (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-eb
'you (will) hand X/them
to Y/them', produced by back-formation from the Aorist mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-e
which originally had the (stIII extant) Prešent-Future (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vd-i
with the Intransitive (Ø-)s-c'vd-eb-l 'you reach out and attain/touch X/them'; any
appropriate preverb is used (as indeed for the corresponding Transitive) to produce
the perfective screeves (e.g. Future m o - / m i - / a - 7 g a - / ( 5 a - ( Ø - ) s - c , v d - e b - i =>
Aorist mo-/mi-/a-/ga-/ča-(Ø-)s-c'vd-i
=> Perfect m o - / m i - / a - / g a - / š a - ( Ø - ) s c'vd-om-i-x-a+r).
1Ø4 Note that there is no preverbless Prešent to this Future, for (Ø-Ø)a-)ax-eb is the
(pseudo-)Causative 'you (will) make X/them shout' (Perfect g-i-)ax-eb-i-a ).
1° 5 For mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb cf. Transitive (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xl-i 'you (will)
bring X/them crashing against Y/them; you (will) shoot X/them at Y/them; you (will)
hurl verbal X at Y/them'.
1Ø6 NO form with mo- is quoted.
1Ø7 Note the prešence of the Thematic Suffix -eb, which means that this is not simply
the basic Medial plus preverb.
1Ø8 This example using either of the transitive synonyms would inGEORGIANbe: (i)
Prešent-Future pot-a-mde or dge-s (mo-)v-(Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb
= (še-)v(Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev
si+a+r+ul-s, (ii) Aorist pot-a-mde or-i dge mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)and+om-e = še-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-l-i-e si+a+r+ul-s , (iii) Perfect pot-a-mde or-i dge
mo-m-i-nd+om-eb-1-a = še-m-i-1-ev-i-a si+a+r+ul-is-tvis
109 Presumably a second Dative (such as game-s 'night' or p'eriod-s 'period') is
understood.
110. E.g. č'+a k+on-eb-a-ze h-k'id-i-a 'eating hangs on having' = 'how one eats
depends on what one has'.
111 For which c'ign-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in either
the prešent or the future.
112
One of the two labio-dentals in such collocations may be omitted.
113 For which malmun-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in
either the prešent or the future.
114 The archaic mo-m-e-sm-i-s (etc..) is also sometimes stIII found.
115 For the preverbal form KEGl quotes the Perfect as mo-m-sm-i-a.","[528, 529, 530, 531]"
