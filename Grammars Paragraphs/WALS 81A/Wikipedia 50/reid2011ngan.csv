"Other than the 10 simple verbs then, all Ngan‘gityemerri verbs are of
the complex type, consisting of the two major units, the auxiliary and the
complex verb stem. The complex verb constitutes a single phonological
word (having only a single primary word stress, cf. 2.5.3) and’ is typically
ordered with the verb stem following the auxiliary, as in 3-2 and 3-4. There
are however two subclasses of verbs that are ordered inversely with the verb
root preceding the auxiliary. These subclasses are:1The verb 'to want/like’' formed with the 'Hands' auxiliary, e.g.
3-5derrigidi- wurrmum-ngi
want- 3plHands-1sgSU Pres
DO
They want/like me.
All complex verbs formed with the ‘Say’ auxiliary, e.g.
3-6~=perrety-meny

-3sgSaySU Perf
He died.",[129]
"- For complex verbs though, I find that stress is neither syllable-timed,
nor morpheme-timed, but falls on the initial syllables of the auxiliary and
the CVS, regardless of their syllabic or morphemic constituency.
Put
another way, stress patterns in the Ngan'gityemerri verb have the
synchronic function of signalling the boundary between the auxiliary and
the CVS. In a fixed-ordered, synthetic/agglutinative verbal structure, why
shouid there be this higher-level grouping of a string of morphemes into
“two ‘halves', and why should this have such saliency for the application of
stress rules? The Ngan'gimerri data collected by Laves (1931) provides a
historical viewpoint that suggests an explanation. A detailed comparison of
the verbal structures exemplified in Laves' Ngan'gimerri data and my own
data on contemporary Ngan'giwumirri, can be found in Reid (to appear).
Just a brief suminary is given here.
The 1931 Ngan'gimerri data suggests that the. precursor to the
contemporary Ngan'gityemerri verb structure, was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a ‘finite verb’, and a freeform ‘participle’ (that shared at least
some features of nominals). These two major elements of the phrasal verb
appear to have formed separate phonological words. They could be ordered
variably with respect to each other, and verbal enclitics could be copied ontoboth elements of the phrasal verb. Compare Laves' example below where
the first word corresponds to the contemporary auxiliary, and the second
word to the contemporary CVS.

"SU PimpThe identity of an actor can require clarification where any of three
pragmatically determined conditions hold. Firstly, where the subject and
object of a verb are both 3rd person singular, or both 3rd person plural, the
bound pronominal morphology on the verb does not suffice to adequately
track participant identity. This is especially true where there are switches in
the identity of subject/object roles and freeform nouns or pronouns in
either role are free to appear in any order with respect to the verb. In 6-3
below the object of the first clause wa-wunu 'that man’, is the agent of the
transitive verb in the second clause and this switch in role is disambiguated
through the attachment of -ninggi.

"immediate environment of peripheral
consonants.
The majority of examples of this front vowel
lowering result from the partial operation of the
Vowel Harmony rule (see 2.4.4). When the
‘animal’ class-marker a- prefixes a nominal root
of which V; is /e/, this rule operates to
harmonise /a/ with /e/. In many instances /a/is
fronted to (z], but fails to be fully raised to the
target articulation of [e).
a-werrmisya-saltwater crocodile [(ewermtfa]a-perrperr-Burdekin duck[zperper]Elsewhere /e/ is consistently realised as {e].
engete- forest kingfisher[enete]egeningge-magpie goose_[egenunge]merrepen- Sand palm[merepen]From these observations on vocalic realisation, it is apparent that theconditioned allophony of /e/ is quite different to that of the other three
vowel phonemes. /i/, /u/ and /a/ all have as their major allophones a pair
of tense and lax realisations, which are essentially conditioned by the feature
't word-final'. In contrast, the only allophonic variant of /e/ appears to be
triggered by the rather obscure condition that it be stressed and in the
immediate environment of a peripheral non-nasal consonant.
2.1.2Diphthongs
Of the four Ngan'gityemerri vowels, e,a and u are subject to
diphthongisation in certain environments. The environment that triggers
this process varies for each vowel, and none of the resultant diphthongs are
phenemic. The following discussion of diphthongs as conditioned
allophones rightly belongs then, in the previous section 2.1.1. They are
treated separately here purely for clarity.
As is common in Australian languages, phonetic diphthongisation
primarily affects back vowels. In Ngan'gityemerri these three vowels can be
ranked in terms of the frequency of, and the number of environments in
which, they diphthongise, in the order a>u>e. The low front vowel is only
minimally diphthongised, and in only a single narrowly defined
environment.
The high front vowel is not audibly subject todiphthongisation at all. As all diphthongisation is triggered by articulatory
preparation for laminal tongue configuration in the following consonant,
this ranking accords with our expectations, in the sense that it is ordered
inversely to the qualities of tongue height and frontedness that are
associated with the quality ‘laminal'’.
In Ngan'gityemerri we find the diphthongs [at] and [ot] occurring
word-finally.
Patterning these diphthongs with the behaviour of back
vowels occurring before the laminal consonants ty, sy and ny, we analyse
them as sequences of /at+ty/ and /uty/ respectively.
/af—[at]-before any syllable-final laminal.","[60, 61, 62]"
"Where tyagani asks ‘what ?' pre-supposing no knowledge about the
entity in question (except that it is inanimate), in contrast, ‘tyen+noun class
generic’ seeks clarification of the species within the genus designated by the
noun class marker/classifier. Tyen- is discussed in more detail in 5.4.
Yityi!- differs in word class status from the other interrogatives in
being a verb root. Yityi- forms a complex verb in combination with only the
‘say/do' auxiliary (recall that complex verbs employing this auxiliary have
their verb root ordered before the auxiliary). Where tyagani asks ‘what ?' of
entities, yityi- 'say/do' enquires about 'what was done or said ?’.

"Secondly, the compounding of nominal roots, and the attachment of
enclitics to nominal roots, can potentially result in the ordering of
contiguous vowels. Such occurrences are rare within noun phrases and
impossible within the verbal complex because Ngan’gityemerri morphologyis generally constructed of CV(C) syllables. Wherever two nominal rootsforming a single phonological word, be it through compounding (as in 2-79aa) or encliticisation (as in 2-79 b), end and begin with i and a respectively,
then i is deleted. Consider the examples below.
2-79 a)
kuri - apukek
-—
kur-apukek
water-under
underwater
b)__ kinyi-ambirrikiny-ambirri
this - firstbefore now
Given the limited distribution of morpheme-initial vowels in
Negan'gityemerri, note that ita is the only possible ordering of contiguous
vowels within a single phonological word.
2.4.3.2rV Deletion
An examination of the Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr
auxiliary verb paradigms (see appendices A and B), shows evidence of a
general aversion to the occurrence in contiguous syllables of the apical stop
/d/ and continuant /r/. Where these are ordered in consecutive syllables,
the syllable containing the continuant will be deleted. e.g. -dVrV- — -dV-.
By way of example, the underlying and surface forms of the Ist, 2nd and 3rd
singular and Ist dl inc, present tense forms of the ‘sit’ auxiliary are given
below.

"Foley and Van Valin (1984::210) claim that aspect is anuclear operator while tense is a peripheral one. They argue that this
difference in scope is reflected in ordering constraints in those languages
that mark tense and aspect as separate inflectional categories. Quotingexamples from Kewa (Franklin 1971) and Tiwi (Osbourne 1974) they note
that aspect is always marked closer to the verb nuclei than tense, and add
that 'they know of no cases of the inverse ordering in which tense is closer
to the stem than aspect'(Foley and Van Valin 1984:210). In contradistinction
to this claim Ngan'gityemerri clearly marks tense closer to the verb nucleus
than imperfective aspect. This is demonstrated in 3-228 below, where the
Past tense enclitic -tye immediately follows the verb root, and is in turn
followed by the serialised 'Sit' auxiliary.

In many examples though, the relationship between the elements of a
lexical compound verb is compositional and implicit, and not amenable to
description in terms of syntactic rules. Sapir makes similar observations on
noun incorporation in American languages;
""it is often just as difficult, at least in some American languages, to draw
the line between the objective and non-objective use of an incorporated nounas it is to determine the precise syntactic value of the qualifying member of
a compound...In both cases the grammatical expression of a logical relation,
in other words a syntactic process, is sacrificed to a compositional process in
which the logical relation is only implied.”","[224, 225]"

Note also that where the 'animal' bound class generic is copied onto
modifiers of class members, it functions as a proclitic, not a prefix (cf. 5.5). As
a proclitic it remains phonologically independent of its host, and is
therefore unaffected by the vowel harmony process. This is demonstratedin 2-84 below.

(i.e. a-melpe > e-melpe, but a-yeyi — “e-yeyi)We can therefore conclude, assuming a dynamic model for morphology,
that vowel harmony is ordered after prefixation but before procliticisation.
Having established that a subset of bound classmarkers have been decliticised and function as prefixes, and having noted the implications of this
function for the process of vowel harmony, I will return to the implications
of this same opposition for the process of diphthongisation. This discussionhas been deferred from 2.1.2.
The examples in 2-85 are ‘animal’ class member terms. On the
nominal roots, each beginning with 'ye-', the ‘animal’ classmarker afunctions as a prefix (as established above). The examples in 2-86 are
modifiers of ‘animal’ class members (also beginning with ‘ye-') and
therefore copy the classmarker as a proclitic not a prefix.

where it functions as a prefix, but is blocked from this process where it

discussed in 5.5.
We can conclude then, that the process of
diphthongisation, like vowel harmony,

"Within a dynamic morphological model we could thereby order these
operations in the following way.prefixing > stress placement > clitic attachment > clitic copying
2.5.3Word Stress on VerbsThe structure of the Ngan‘gityemerri verb is described in detail in
chapter 3 and has been briefly sketched out in 2.4.4.2. Readers are referred
to either of these sections for definitions of ‘auxiliary’ and 'complex verbstem’, and for descriptions of the constituency of these elements of the verb.
The discussion below looks firstly at the stress placement rules on
‘simple verbs ', then ‘complex verbs’, and concludes with some comme:sabout the function of stress marking patterns within the synchronic verb

"Note that the bound generics in 5-127 and 5-128 are unusual in two
respects. Firstly in all the other patterns of their occurrence (discussed
throughout this chapter) bound generics function as either proclitics, or in
some cases as prefixes (see 5.5). In combination with tyen- and minbehowever, they appear to function as suffixes. Secondly, as a suffix the
‘animal’ class bound generic has the form -ga, whereas as a proclitic/ prefix it
has the form a-.
5.5Phonological Status of Bound Class Generics
All the freeform generics listed in Table I function as independent
phonological words. Here I am more concerned with the phonological
status of the bound generics which are split between prefix and proclitic.
This distinction is based on the ordering of phonological processes inNgan'gityemerri and results in different levels of phonological dependency
operating between the host nominal and the bound class generic.
Cliticisation is a late-ordered process in the sense that clitic
attachment to a nominal root takes place after all other phonological
processes - stress assignment, assimilation, vowel harmony etc. Procliticswoh5-130 minbe-yenggi-wurru

"2.4.2Apical Assimilation_Where morphological processes order the apical stops /t/ and /d/, or
the apical nasal /n/, after the apical flap /rr/, this process assimilates the flap
to the manner of the following segment. Assimilation of this kind produces
stop and nasal geminates that are contrastive with single stops and nasals
(see also the discussion of gemination in 2.2.2.2). This process does not
apply to every /rr/ + /apical stop~nasal/ cluster that results from
morphological processes, but applies in only two specific environments. Its
most frequent application is within the verbal morphology, at the juncture
between the subject number marker and the auxiliary root. Within
nominal morphology this process can be seen to operate at the juncture
between the ‘tree/thing’ classmarking prefix and its host. Each of these
environments is examined below.
2.4.2.1Subject Number Marker - Auxiliary Root
As described fully in 3.2, the auxiliary root bears obligatory bound
pronominal subject person, and subject number prefixes.

"In Laves' data bound object pronouns are suffixes to the ‘finite verb’,whereas in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri they are suffixes to the auxiliary.
Likewise in Laves' data, the applicative prefixes fi- and mi- are incorporatedbodypartsattachedtothe‘participle’,whereasincontemporaryNgan'gityemerri they are prefixes to the verb root. In Reid (to appear) I
suggest that within the last few generations the Ngan'gityemerri verb has
undergone radical change. The ‘finite verb’ and ‘participle’ found in Laves'
data, which functioned as separate phonological words, developed a fixed
ordering and were ‘glomped' together into a single phonological word.
Verbal enclitics can no longer be copied onto both elements, as in 2-125
above, but are now attached to the complex verb unit.
If we accept that the ‘finite verb’ and ‘participle’ of the phrasal verb
were separate phonological words, we can further presume that each of
these two words would have borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In
the contemporary Ngan'gityemerri verb, where these two ‘halves' have
been collapsed into a single phonological word, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial syllables
of the auxiliary and CVS respectively. In conclusion then, the ‘salience’ of
the boundary between the auxiliary and the CVS for the application of stress
rules in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri can be accounted for in terms of the
structural developments that the verb has (only recently) undergone.","[126, 127]"
"|$Having made this claim that speakers of incorporating languages remember
all combinations of 'incorporated noun + verb’ as a lexicalised unit, Mithun
uses this as a basis to draw a distinction between noun incorporation and
other truly . syntactic processes. Speakers of non-incorporating languages,
she argues, do not remember all possible combinations of verb and object.",[223]
"Given that these verbs are monovalent, and that the person and
number of the single argument is unambiguously encoded in the bound
subject marker, the occurrence of indirect object pronouns in the final
position of the auxiliary in reflexive/reciprocal verbs is essentially
redundant. It generally carries no new information (although note that -ngein 3-99 does include gender information whereas the subject pronoun does
not), and can be included or omitted with no significant difference to the
meaning of the verb. The inclusion of bound indirect object pronouns indetransitivised auxiliaries, may be largely governed by practical
considerations, such as distinguishing between those ‘transitive’ and
‘detransitivised'auxiliariesthat are similarin form,like 'Bash'and‘BashDtr' in 3-100 and 3-101, which are distinguished only by the quality of
the auxiliary root vowel. Within the context of the harmonic processes that
regressively influence vowel quality in the verb complex (cf. 2.4.4.2), the
inclusion of the indirect object pronoun in 3-101 does serve to draw
attention to the ‘detransitivised’ (and therefore reciprocal) status of the
auxiliary.

Noun ClassificationNgan'gityemerri speakers employ a system of nominal classification
that divides the nominal world into fifteen categories.
Section 5.1
examines the manner in which membership within these categories is
signalled, and section 5.2 deals with the semantics of these categories. 5.3
looks at the types of modifying element that can be classmarked. 5.4 details
the suffixation of class generics to minbe ‘negative’ and tyen ‘what'. Finally
section 5.5 examines the phonological status of the set of bound class
generics, which varies between proclitics and prefixes.

Table 5-15.1
5.1.1Morphology of Nominal Classification
Descriptive Preliminaries
The classification of nouns in Ngan'gityemerri into fifteen separatecategories is signalled through the use of both freeform and bound generics.
While most nouns can be assigned to at least one class, there are some
nouns, mostly terms for natural objects such as sun, rocks, ground, stars,
tdclouds etc. that belong to no overtly marked class. I have chosen to analyse
these as belonging to no class rather than to a sixteenth O-marked class; a
decision that carries no significant consequences.
On the whole,
this system of noun classification is neither
homogenous nor internally consistent. Of the fifteen classes, six are denoted
by only freeform generics, five by only bound generics, and four employboth bound and freeform generics. Furthermore, among the class categories
having bound generics, there is considerable diversity regarding the
phonological status of those generics (see 5.5), and the types of modifiers to
which they may be attached (see 5.3).
Another important feature of the Ngan'gityemerri noun classificatory
system that will be treated here, concerns the grammatical status of the
mechanisms that signal class categories. As this has implications for the
terminology used in this section, I will begin with a review of Dixon's (1982)
comparison of the noun classification phenomena in Yidiny and Dyirbal.
Dixon (1982: chpt 5-8) compares the different systems in Yidiny and
Dyirbal that have the semantic function of classifying nouns, and contrasts
the grammatical status of these two systems. He provides criteria for
determining whether a language has a system of noun classes (like Dyirbal)on the one hand, or noun classifiers (like Yidiny) on the other.
""In summary, noun classes constitute a closed grammatical system, with a _
finite (usually fairly small) and determinable number of choices involved;each noun belongs to one class and few (or none) will correspond to more than
one class. Noun class is shown by morphological processes which can apply to
the noun itself and must apply to some other constituent; they sometimes
combine information about noun class and number, case or definiteness. The
morphological process most often involves adding an affix or clitic to
constituents of a number of specified grammatical types. Classifiers comprise a
largish (often semi-open) set, whose members may not be exhaustively
listable; each classifier is either a free form or else a root, to which a numeralaffix or clitic may be added. Not every noun may take a classifier; many nouns
may occur with one of a number of different classifiers, sometimes with a
be used in different ways in different speech styles within a language.""ayDixon goes on to speculate about the origins of these different
mechanisms in Yidiny and Dyirbal, suggesting both may have developedreBape(Dixon 1982:217-8)coatdifference in meaning and sometimes not. Classifiers, but not noun classes, mayfrom a small set of about half a dozen classifiers.","[312, 313, 314]"
"-Complex nominals, such as reduplications and compounds, have a
morpheme-timed stress marking pattern.
We also noted that as ‘simple
verbs' became increasingly complex (i.e. as direct and indirect object bound
pronouns were suffixed to the ‘subject-auxiliary root’ sequence), then
secondary stress began falling on the initial syllable of the pronoun, rather
than the third syllable (see 2-99). I noted that for morphologically complex
words there seems to be a preference for allocating stress marking in a way
that reflects morphemic constituency.","[125, 126]"

inherently gender-specific, as in 5-36 and 5-37.

be understood to imply that nouns of the classes ‘male’ and ‘female’ are, in
contrast, singular in number. All the examples given in 5-35 to 5-37 are
numerically unspecified, and equally amenable of plural interpretation.

"In 3.2.3.1 above we have seen how object suffixes fill the final
auxiliary position immediately following the auxiliary root. In section
3.2.1.2.2 we saw that subject duality is encoded primarily by the suffix -gV,
also in this same position. That is, both morpheme types compete for access
to the same verbal slot.
The dual subject marker -gV can only appear when this position is
otherwise empty of overt object morphology. This condition is met where
either a verb is intransitive and has no object argument, as in 3-84 a), or is
transitive but has a 3rd sg direct object, which is cross-referenced by - ©, as in3-84 b).

This thesis is a study of Ngan'gityemerri, a language spoken
primarily in and around the two communities of Nauiyu Nambiyu and
Peppimenarti in the Northern Territory.
Chapter One provides an introduction to the names by which
speakers of this language have been referred to, comments on the
relationship between the two dialects, and establishes my use of the term
Ngan'gityemerri as a language name. Also included in this chapter is a brief
account of the history of these people since European invasion of their
country began late last century, some comments on social organisation,
cultural affiliations, Wangga and Lirrga songstyles, and a description of their
country. The current status of the language is reviewed, and the language
variety presented in this work is clearly identified. A survey of previous
work on Ngan'gityemerri, and a description of my fieldwork methodology
are additionally included.
Chapter Two presents the segmental phonology, phonotactics, stress
patterns and morphophonological processes. Particular attention, in the
form of a detailed acoustic study, is given to the mechanism by which the
contrast between two series of stops is maintained.
Chapter Three presents an overview of ‘simple’ and 'complex' verb
structures, then identifies the morphological make-up of the verbal
_elements labelled ‘auxiliary’ and ‘complex verb stem’. The mechanisms
that interact to mark categories of tense, aspect and mood, namely auxiliary
root inflection, verbal enclitics, verb root reduplication and the serialisation
of posture/motion auxiliaries, are all addressed in this chapter. The
incorporation into the verb of bodypart noun roots is also investigated here.
A distinction between ‘lexical’ and ‘syntactic’ incorporation is invoked, and
the differences in the effect of both these types of incorporation is dealt with.
A list of incorporable terms is presented, and their literal and classificatory
semantics explored.
Chapter Four investigates the semantic contribution that the
auxiliary makes to the meaning of a full verb. The 31 auxiliaries are broken
down into six groups on the basis of their functional roles, which are
described in detail.
Chapter Five deals with the role played by both freeform and bound
generics in classifying the Ngan'gityemerri nominal world. The
morphology of these generics is surveyed with regard to the typological
distinction drawn between ‘noun class’ systems on the one hand, and‘classifier’ systems on the other. The semantics of noun class categories are
also examined here.
Chapter Six examines the set of enclitics, some of which have scope
over NPs and others over clausal propositions. The semantic functions of
this clitic set vary widely, some marking such case-like roles as 'agent' or
‘instrument’, others encoding the kinds of meanings, like speaker attitude,
that are commonly attributed to free particles. The class of free particles is
treated in Chapter Seven.
Chapter Eight provides a brief presentation of space, time and
number expression, and Chapter Nine deals with the freeform pronominal
system, demonstratives and interrogatives.
Appendices to this grammar include the full subject-auxiliary
sequence paradigms for both Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as
well as four texts. Cassette tapes of the textual material included in the
appendices have been submitted with this thesis, and copies of these will
gladly be made available by the author to any interested readers.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"The range of bodypart terms found in lexical compounds is
significantly smaller than those which incorporate syntactically. Whereas
any member of the bodypart noun class can be syntactically incorporated, itis only those major bodypart terms listed in Table 3-8 that can compound
with verb roots to derive new verb roots.
What then of the grammatical relations allowed to hold between the
bodypart and verb root members of a lexical compound ? The majority of

Examples are structured as four lines. The first line is the
Ngan'gityemerri sentence/word in bold script. Loanwords are treated in
one of two ways. English loans which essentially retain their English
phonemicisation and meaning are given in the first line of examples in
plain rather than bold script, to denote their status as loan words (or in some
cases, code-switching). Loans from English which have been phonemicised
into Ngan'gityemerri, or have acquired new or extended meanings as
loanwords are given in bold script and provided with an interlinear gloss on
lines two and three (i.e. in accordance with Ngan'gityemerri speakers’
perception of such words, I have treated them as ‘proper NgK or NgW’).
The second and third lines of examples, in italic script, provide an
interlinear gloss. I've found the use of two lines necessary simply because of
the morphological density of the verb in particular. Lines 2 and 3 are meant
to be read jointly from left to right, rather than sequentially. For instance,
the gloss to the example given below should be read as;
wuddumbuny-ngerr -mi -wul
-nime-pagu
3pl Shove
-dl/1sg-Val-return- tr | -HITHSeSU Perf
Su/DO
su
They (three) brought me back here.
""third plural subject, ‘shove’ auxiliary in perfective inflection, portmanteau
dual subject and first singular direct object, valence increaser, return (verb
root), trial subject, hither directional”
As evident in the above example, I use a slash / between the glossed
elements of a portmanteau morpheme.
Another minor convention is the
inclusion, below the verb root, of the meaning of the verb. This is given
only in those verbs whose meaning is unpredictable from the combination
of the auxiliary and verb root semantics.
Auxiliary roots are glossed by name (e.g. 'Shove' in the example
above). The semantic nature of auxiliary verbs is discussed in detail in
chapter 5, and readers seeking explanation of auxiliary root glosses are
referred to this section. The 31 auxiliary names are listed below.

translation. I've been fairly free with translations, attempting, in addition to
an accurate rendition, to convey something of the speech style. To this end,
in a few cases I have translated using expressions that are characteristic of
the English of Ngan'gityemerri speakers, but which may be less well known
in standard Australian English.
The use of brackets ( ) in the fourth line of examples either provides
contextual information which is missing from the given example, but
established within the wider discourse, or clarifies implications of the
example. e.g. I brought it for her (to give to her), (on her behalf), (at her
request) etc. A bracketed sentence below the line-4 translation is an
alternative translation.
Example numbers are of the form 3-56, where 3 denotes the chapter
number, and 56 denotes the example number within that chapter. Examples
in each chapter are renumbered from 1. Ngan'gikurunggurr examples are
marked by 'NgK’ below the example number. All examples not designated
as NgK should be understood to be Ngan'giwumirri, unless specified in the
text as some other language.","[22, 23, 24]"

"The combination of auxiliaries and verb stems is, in the main, aproductive process. The extent of this productivity is an issue that we will
return to throughout this section. The point to be made here though, is that
auxiliaries do not form 31 rigid, mutually exclusive verb classes to which
verb stems belong. This view of auxiliaries, as found for instance in Tryon
(1974), implies some sort of logical linkage between the semantics of each
auxiliary and the semantic properties inherent in those CVSs which select
them. However it is not the case that each CVS selects a single auxiliary, or
can be said to belong to a single auxiliary class. The productivity of auxiliary
- CVS combination varies widely. While some auxiliaries are in fact only
found in combination with a single CVS, others select a wide number of
CVSs. It will become apparent from the discussion of each auxiliary later in
this section, that independent semantic characteristics can be attributed to
both auxiliaries and CVSs, and that the productive manipulation of thesecharacteristics supports the view that both auxiliaries and CVSs are separate
entities, each maintaining its own semantic integrity and having somesort of psychological reality in the minds of Ngan‘gityemerri speakers.
In order to present the Ngan'gityemerri auxiliary system in the
clearest possible way, we can divide the 31 auxiliaries up in terms of several
criteria. We have already divided the 10 simple auxiliaries from the 21
complex auxiliaries. They can be further divided in terms of whether they
are predominantly transitive or intransitive, and in terms of the degree of
productivity they bring to CVS combination. As a preliminary to this
investigation of the semantics of the Ngan'‘gityemerri auxiliaries, these two
issues, the transitivity of both auxiliary verbs and CVSs, and their degree ofproductivity, are addressed in the following two subsections.
42TransitivityIn addition to the semantic characteristics attributable to auxiliaries
and CVSs, both can be assigned associated transitivity values. That is, on the
basis of the majority of verbs formed with each auxiliary, and the number of
core arguments those verbs are able to cross-reference, auxiliaries and
particular CVSs can be labelled essentially ‘transitive’ or essentially‘intransitive.",[244]

Verbs involving the manipulation by a subject of his own bodyparts,
are formed with ‘detransitivised' auxiliaries (cf. 4.5.2). While verbs formedwith ‘detransitivised’ auxiliaries are formally intransitive, being unable to
cross-reference the undergoer bodypart with bound object pronouns, they do
pattern with transitive verbs in having object-like arguments that can be
included as freeform nominals. Compare formally intransitive 3-278 a)with transitive 3-278 b) below.

"Syntactically incorporated bodyparts are always optional, they can beomitted from the verb and instead be paraphrased by an external nominal.
Bodyparts can be syntactically incorporated into any semantically compatible
verb, whereas lexically incorporated bodyparts cannot be predicted, and
require specification within the lexicon.
The main types of grammatical relations that are permissive of the
syntactic incorporation of bodypart terms are where their possessors are the
objects and locatives of transitive verbs, or the subjects of verbs formed withthe 'detransitivised' and 'Say' auxiliaries. Each of these are discussed below.

Or where the object can sustain a whole/part relationship, the object is

In section 3.2.1.2.2 we saw that four auxiliaries marked subject duality, not by
-gV in the final auxiliary position, but suppletively by a change in thequality of the vowel of the auxiliary root. For these few auxiliaries there is
no competition between dual subject marking and non-singular object
marking for access to the post-auxiliary root position. So verbs selecting
these auxiliaries can encode both their subject duality and the person and
number of their object.

3.2.3.3-Nime as Non-Subject Marker
We have seen how -nime in the post-verb root position marks both
the subject number categories ‘1st inclusive plural’ (cf. 3.2.1.2.1) and ‘Istexclusive, 2nd and 3rd person trial’ (cf. 3.2.1.2.2).","[156, 157]"
"Dual subject number is marked by (in addition to the plural -rr-) -gV
in the fourth position within the auxiliary, ie. immediately following the
auxiliary root. Note that this same slot within the auxiliary can also be filled
by non-subject bound pronouns which outrank -gV for access. Dual subject
-gV is therefore generally restricted to occurrence in intransitive verbs, ortransitive verbs with 3rd singular @ object pronouns. There is however a set
of portmanteau bound pronouns that encode subject duality in addition to
object person and number. These are discussed in more detail in 3.2.3.2.
Trial subjects further augment the dual form with -nime in the
position immediately following the auxiliary unit in the case of simpleverbs, or immediately following the verb root in the case of complex verbs.
Note then that while the addition of the suffix -nime derives plural from
dual 1st-inclusive forms, in the case of non-1st-inclusive subjects, the samesuffix form derives specifically trial forms. The formation of these three
non-singular number categories is demonstrated in 3-51.

suAs can be seen from these examples, morphological markedness
parallels semantic markedness. That is, increasingly restricted and specific
number categories are increasingly morphologically complex. The trial
number category, being so highly marked in both senses, tends not to be
exploited where such high markedness is pragmatically unwarranted. So
Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr speakers, in a discourse involving
three subject persons, would tend to employ plural subject marking, unless
the subjects’ 'threesomeness' is perceived to be significant.","[144, 145]"

"I will now turn my attention to the complex function of the
remaining minor simple auxiliaries, ‘Say’, ‘Arrive’, 'See' and 'Take'.
As noted in 3.1.1 the complex function of the ‘say' auxiliary is quite
anomalous in having the auxiliary ordered after the verbroot, rather than
in the regular verb-initial position. This irregular ordering is exemplified
in 4-106 and 4-107. Further, the CVS no longer operates as a single
functional unit; incorporated bodyparts, for instance, do not shift to the preauxiliary position along with the verb root, but remain in the post-auxiliary
position, as shown in 4-108 and 4-109.

In 2.3.2 we noted that 63% of all words are vowel final. From the

observations. The apical trill at 12.6%, and the apical nasal /n/ at 8.3%
account for over half of all word-final consonants. The pattern suggested by
these figures, that word finally non-peripherals are more common than
peripherals, is not borne out by the stops. The dorsal /k/ is the most
frequent final stop (3.6%), followed by the non-peripherals /t/ (2.3%) and
/ty/ (1.3%) Bilabial /p/, the least frequent (0.6%), appears finally in
nominals, only in the C2C3 cluster /rrp/, eg: ngurrp ‘emu’ and ferrp ‘often’,
and in a couple of verb roots, eg: wap 'sit', pap ‘climb’ etc, which in the
absence of verbal enclitics, can be word final.
The continuant /r/ has only been recorded word finally in a single
Ngan'gikurunggurr word, and three Ngan'giwumirri words, adigar (W/K)
‘Australian pratincole', amugar (W) ‘bony bream' and awugur (W) ‘small
fish sp. used for livebait'. However it is found more commonly syllable
finally on a number of bound prefixes wur- ‘female’, ngur- ‘penis’ etc.
The labiodorsal semivowel /w/ has only been recorded finally in a
single word, the exclamation (ka)kaw ‘come here!’. The possible elision of
a final vowel, or some other form of phonological aberration, would not be
particularly unexpected in a member of the imperative/ejaculatory
wordclass, however in this instance its occurrence is contrastive with a
vowel final word.

"Note though that reflexives and reciprocals can additionally be more
explicitly encoded with indirect object pronominal forms in the final
position of the auxiliary. In this function they differ from the other ‘goallike’ functions of the Indirect Objects in that they encode the
reflexive/reciprocal relationship for both higher and lower animates. That
is, the animacy restrictions that determine the eligibility of goal argumentsfor cross-referencing within the verb (cf. 3.2.3.1), do not apply to reciprocals
and reflexives. Thus the lower animate subject of the reflexive verb formed
with the 'detransitivised' ‘Poke’ auxiliary in 3-98 takes Indirect Objectpronoun -ne.

indirect object forms are also available, though as demonstrated in 3-99,
their selection constitutes a marked claim about the gender of the lower
animate(s).",[159]
"Indirect Object forms cross-reference higher animates that are: the
implied locatives of intransitive motion verbs (3-76); the goals of speech actverbs (3-77); the targets of cognitive and perceptual verbs® like ‘forget’ (3-78),
‘remember’, ‘recognise’, ‘listen’, ‘hear’; and entities that are the less affected‘objects’, beneficiaries or goals of transitive verbs (3-79).
Direct Object forms, on the other hand, cross-reference those non-controlling patient-like participants that are acted upon by a transitive agent,
including the recipient of ‘give’ (3-80 to 3-83).
It is the semantic nature of Ngan'gityemerri verbs that determines
whether they cross-reference participants with DO or IO forms. Although we
can make the general observation that DOs are highly affected patients, and
10s are less affected targets and goals, participants in a given verb cannot be
variously coded with either set of forms. That is, the difference between DO
and IO marking does not constitute a grammatical device that can be
manipulated to allow for different degrees of patient affectivity.",[151]

¥-napa‘JUST’, -nawa‘INSTEAD’,and-wurru'UNSATISfactory',areexamined in 6.2.
Several members of the set of enclitics belong to more than one type.
For instance, as a verbal enclitic, -gumu has the function of marking
temporal subordinate clauses, whereas as a propositional enclitic it indicates
that one entity/event reSEMBLes another.
6.1NominalEnclitics6.1.1-ninggi
AGENT
As established in 3.2 above, core case relations are obligatorily andexplicitly cross-referenced within the verb. Consequently the specification of
these relations through case inflections on NP’s filling these case functions
is not required to clarify the identity of core case roles. Indeed verbal crossreferencing facilitates the widespread omission of contextually established
NP's in core roles. No case suffix is available for those NP's that are crossreferenced within the verb as direct objects. NP's cross-referenced as ‘goals'
can be functioning in peripheral purposive case roles, in which case they can
take the purposive enclitic -ne/-ngini(K), or as reflexives, or the goals of
predicates (like ‘tell’, 'give'), in which core roles they can bear no case
inflection.
The subject of a verb is the only core syntactic role for which case
inflection is available. These can be subjects of either high-transitive verbs
or those low-transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument (cf. 4.2).
The agentive enclitic -ninggi is not universally applied to transitive subject
NP's, but is reserved for those which are semantically or pragmatically
‘marked'. NP's can be semantically marked in the sense that their identity
in the agentive role contravenes culturally determined expectations
regarding actor identity in specific types of activity. In 6-1 below, for
instance, markedness results from the low likelihood of an inanimate entityfilling the role of a ‘controlling agent’.

The ‘unsatisfactory’ evaluation of a proposition (or, more especially,
an individual's role in a proposition), that is convey by -wurru, can interact
with the semantics of the verb and the general context of the discourse in a
way that leads to the interpretation of the speech act as an expression of
compassion or an expression of criticism. For instance, a -wurru marked NP
that is portrayed as the victim of some verb of adverse effect, as in 6-122, is
understood to be the object of the speaker's compassion. On the other hand,
a-wurru marked NP that is portrayed as the perpetrator of some adverse
proposition (or even potentially adverse proposition), is understood to be
the object of the speaker's criticism, as in 6-123.

ParticlesParticles differ from enclitics in being independent freeform
phonological words, and generally occurring clause-initially. Otherwise they
share broadly similar semantic functions to the enclitics discussed in the
preceding chapter. Wilkins (1989:347) has drawn attention to the ‘significant
degree of agreement between the stocks of meanings encoded through the
particle/clitic grouping’ in Australian languages generally. Most of the
particles discussed here have scope over an entire clausal proposition. The
three forms examined in 7.10 have the function of conjoining nouns and
clauses under certain, fairly limited, conditions. Particles cannot take any
form of inflection. 7.11 lists the class of interjections, which differ from
particles in constituting complete utterances on their own.

Tyepe indicates that some proposition is the only thing within the

Initially -ywFigure 2-6C; cannot be either of the rhotics /r/18 or /rr/, nor can it be the apical
fricative /s/. In view of the rhotacised quality attributed to /s/ in 2.1.3.2, this
shared failure to appear initially may suggest re-analysis of the fricative as a
rhotic. Such an analysis is however ultimately unfruitful as /s/ fails to
form a natural class with the two rhotics in all other occurrence positions.
As is typical for Australian languages, initial stops and nasals are far
more likely to be peripheral than non-peripheral. Initial /t/ and /n/ each
account for less than 1% of the lexicon, and initial /ny/ is attested in two
words only - nyinyi ‘you sg.', and nyurrng ‘sniff,snort'. The voiced apical
stop /d/ has a far higher percentage of occurrence than we would predict for
a non-peripheral stop. This results from its initial occurrence on the
bodypart and 3sg subject prefixes, both of which have a high functional load.
Generally though, voiced stops are far less common word initially than
voiceless stops.","[96, 97]"

In addition to the encoding of imperfective aspect, the serialisation of
the ‘go’ and ‘go” auxiliaries achieves a variety of different meanings, again
parallel to the range of meanings brought about by substitution of the 'go'
and ‘go* main auxiliaries. Primarily, in contrast to the postural auxiliaries,
serialisation of the ‘go’ auxiliaries classifies an activity as aspectually
imperfective, with the subject in motion. Indeed the ‘extended over time'
perspective can be seen to result logically from the fact that the activity is
performed while the subject is in motion.

Additionally, and as noted by Green (1989:181) probably extending
from the general sense of motion from place to place, serialisation of the
'go' auxiliaries
can categorise verbs within several subtypes of the
imperfective aspect; repetitive, progressive and habitual, i.e. 'to keep doing
X, to do X again and again, to always do X'. For repetitive and progressive
aspect, as noted in the discussion above on literal motion, 'go*’ (in 3-248)
tends to differ from ‘go' in implying more motivated activity directed
towards a specific goal.
