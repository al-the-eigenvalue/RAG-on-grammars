Note that any recording that contains at least some moments of interview-format
conversation is entitled “Interview” in Table 1. This does not imply that these
recordings only contain interview-format conversation. Most of them, in fact, contain moments that qualify as several of the categories of speech performances just
listed. The capital letters <A, B, C...> in the fourth column of Table 1 identify specific recordings in cases where my corpus contains several recordings by the same
speaker (see conventions for “Speaker and utterance references” on p.23). A sample
of excerpts from the recordings in Table 1 are available online at the following address: <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafhTQ1bTrPt6vohQgjEcAw>. An
extensive, fully-interlinearized transcription of the recording C by lar (“Myth
of Ngutapa”) is additionally provided in Appendix A of the present work.
The main shortcoming of my corpus in terms of variety of included discourse
genres is its lack of texts representing non-staged conversation. Despite considerable and repeated efforts, I was not able to record non-staged conversations with
a sufficient level of audio quality as to allow for their posterior transcription. The
steady ground noise in the environment, especially after dawn (insects, in particular) when speakers sit and relax after their day of work, is high in sma. Because
I only had a single head worn microphone at my disposal, at least one speaker
in a conversational setting had to be recorded with another type of microphone,
but it turned out that even recordings of conversations between no more than two
speakers with one of them being recorded with a shotgun (i.e. a highly directional)
microphone proved insufficiently audible to allow for an accurate and extensive
transcription of at least some parts of it. A cultural circumstance that further complicates the recording of conversations in smat is the fact that speakers engaged
in relaxed conversations with few participants have a strong tendency to talk in
a significantly lower voice than in e.g. Western European cultures. Exploitable
recordings of spontaneous or half-staged conversations in smat will require the
use of as many head worn microphones as conversation participants.
Of the 10 hours that make my corpus, note that only about 5 have been entirely transcribed and freely translated into Spanish with the systematic help
of one or several speakers. The transcription and translation of these 5 hours can
therefore be considered as highly reliable. The remaining 5 hours have not benefitted from such a systematic process of interpretation. For part of them, I only have a
systematically verified transcription, but no systematically verified translation, or
the other way around. I have been able to verify neither the transcription nor the
translation of another part of these remaining 5 hours, which I pre-transcribed by

myself over the course of the research project waiting for an opportunity to verify
them. A vast majority of the examples presented in this grammatical description
stem from the part of my corpus that I have been able to fully verify with
smat speakers. I only resorted to non-fully verified examples, or exceptionally to
unverified examples, in cases where a non-fully verified or unverified example provided a clear and uncontroversial instance of a phenomenon widely attested in the
verified part of the corpus. The main two reasons why I was not able to complete
the systematic verification of the whole corpus were 1) the irregular availability of
speakers, which did not allow me to work as much as I would have liked, and 2)
the complexity of the language’s tonological system, which for months could make
the correct transcription of a single syllable into a long and painful process.
Elicitation and systematic transcription and translation have been mostly conducted with dsg, ear, jgs, jsg, and lar, which undoubtedly entails unintentional
biases in this grammatical description towards the subdialectal variants employed by these speakers.11
The recordings that constitute my corpus were made for the most part using a
Zoom Q8 audio-video recorder and a Shure BETA 53 head worn microphone,
which proved an optimum combination of recording quality, ease of use, volume,
and weight. Using a head worn microphone, i.e. an admittedly relatively invasive
device, considerably improved the recording quality (by contrast with any device—
including highly directional microphones—placed at a greater distance from the
speaker’s mouth) without posing cultural issues at any point in the context of sma.
The recordings included a video whenever possible, which significantly enriched
their posterior analysis. Note that given the tonological complexity of the language,
The mother of dsg and jsg, two brothers who grew up in sma, was from the area of the Agua
Blanca river, a tributary of the upper Amacayacu river; their father was from the area of the Cotuhé
river, a minor tributary of the Putumayo river. ear and lar, two sisters, have lived most of their
lives in sma; their mother, gra, grew up mostly in Caballococha and the upper Loretoyacu river,
a minor tributary of the Amazon upriver from the mouth of the Amacayacu; I do not know the
geographic origins of their late father, Marcelino Ángel. jgs, finally, grew up mostly in Buenos
Aires and Caña Brava, two communities settled on the Cotuhé river, and definitively settled in sma
at the age of 16; I do not have clear data regarding the geographic origins of either of his parents.
Note, in any case, that the geographic origins of these speakers and their parents, although they
certainly account for most of the linguistic variation that occurs among them, obviously do not
account for all the characteristics of their idiolects. ear and lar, for instance, two sisters who have
lived most of their lives in the same area, diverge on the subdialectal variant of the conjunction náʼa
∼ ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ ‘conj’ they use, with ear using the former variant and lar the latter variant.
11441. Introduction
boring morphemes in order to be realized (excepting cases involving the consonant
/ʔ/). The correspondence between the shape of morphemes and their function (i.e.,
from the practical perspective of the analyst, the identification of morphemes) is
relatively straightforward in most domains of the morphological system of the language, except in the complex inflectional morphology of the finite predicative
phrase, due to extensive fusion, syncretism, and homophony between unrelated
morphemes in this domain.
smat nouns are morphologically distributed in independent nouns (stressed
free forms) and bound nouns (unstressed bound forms). The language features five
nominal classes. Agreement for nominal class, which manifests itself throughout
the nominal phrase and in the indexation of participants within the predicative
phrase, is obligatory. The assignment of participants to a given nominal class in
discourse, however, is flexible even within a single speech event and depends in
complex ways on lexical, semantic, and pragmatic criteria. Nominal phrases in
subject and object syntactic function are left unmarked (i.e. occur in the zerocase). By contrast, non-core syntactic functions are encoded, in most cases, by
means of a rich system of case-marking suffixes and relational nouns that are
attached to the nominal phrase. This tendency to dependent-marking coexists with
an opposite tendency to head-marking in cases where a nominal phrase comes after
(instead of before) the predicative phrase, in which case its syntactic function is
preferably marked through indexation within the predicative phrase (in cases where
indexes are available for participants in the corresponding syntactic function) and
the nominal phrase itself is left unmarked for syntactic function.
smat completely lacks a class of adjectives. Modification of nominal phrases
typically realized by means of adjectives in other languages is regularly realized
in smat by the subject relativization of stative predicative phrases. The language
does possess, by contrast, a reduced class of adverbs, whose single function is to
directly modify the predicative phrase.
Predicative phrases in smat can be verbal (i.e. based on a typically monosyllabic verb root) or non-verbal. Verb roots, which may receive inflectional
morphology of the finite predicative phrase as they stand, have access to a rich
paradigm of derivational suffixes most of which encode the nature of the spatial relation that holds between a figure (the subject or object participant) and a ground
at the culminating phase of the process. They also frequently incorporate nominal
constituents. Both verbal and non-verbal predicative phrases may additionally receive one or several of a number of derivational suffixes encoding categories such
as Aktionsart, aspect, mood, intensity, or number, among others. The intricate
501.5. Typological profile of San Martín de Amacayacu Tikuna
inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase provides slots for the
indexation of subject and object arguments, as well as that of participants in the
accusative (a syntactic function distinct from that of (core) object), benefactive,
locative, and partitive object syntactic functions. The inflection of the predicative
phrase additionally encodes predicative class (an ultimately lexical feature of predicative phrases, which are distributed in five predicative classes) and, optionally,
associated motion (i.e. the occurrence of a backgrounded motion event prior to
the main process). The encoding of tense is completely absent from the domain
of the predicative phrase. Tense is encoded instead within the nominal phrase
(“nominal tense”) or by means of clause-level enclitics.
smat can be broadly characterized as a nominative-accusative language. The
unique argument of intransitive predicative phrases (U) can indeed be said to align
with the agent argument of transitive predicative phrases (A, as opposed to its patient argument P) as far as the encoding of their syntactic function is concerned
(although this alignment can really only be observed in the indexation of these arguments within the predicative phrase, but not if these arguments are expressed
as syntactically free nominal phrases, in which case nothing allows to tell how U,
A, and P—which are all left unmarked—align). Note, however, that the effect of
certain derivational suffixes of the verb root or the predicative phrase follows an
ergative-absolutive alignment (e.g. the plural allomorph of some of these suffixes
encodes the plurality of U or P, but never A).
It is unclear whether an unmarked order of main constituents (or Basic Word
Order) can be detected in smat from a pragmatic perspective. Only the relative
ordering of the subject (S) and the object (O) is constrained in (rare) cases where
both of them are expressed as nominal phrases and occur before the predicative
phrase (V) (✓ SOV, not *OSV). Apart from *OSV, however, all possible orders occur
in apparently any type of clause (in slightly varying morphosyntactic structures)
without, in most cases, one of them being clearly identifiable as less marked than
the others pragmatically. From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, however,
the order S(O)V can be considered as the least marked insofar as it is the one that
requires the least morphosyntactic material.
A rich system of particles and clause-level enclitics encode notions of tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality, and polarity, among others.
Aspects of smat grammar that might currently be of particular interest to
typologists are the language’s rich tonological system (see Sections 2.4, 2.6.2,
and 2.7.3), its system of nominal classes characterized by obligatory agreement but
511.6. Organization of this grammatical description
coding of predicative—or “conjugation”—class; note that none of these functions
relates to tense, aspect, or mood). The functional distribution of the three Inflectional Types (Indicative, Imperative, and Subjunctive Inflectional Types), which
constitute the three values of the last inflectional category of the smat PP, is described next. The encoding of Inflectional Type does not possess a specific locus
within the inflectional template of the PP, but is expressed instead through the use
of one or the other of the three slightly different paradigms of morphemes that
are available in certain slots of the template. The chapter proceeds to give a detailed formal account of the inflectional morphology of the slots of the template
whose paradigms vary as a function of Inflectional Type, followed by an account
of the morphology of the slots whose paradigms remain identical across the three
Inflectional Types. It closes with functional discussions of two of the grammatical categories encoded in the inflection of the PP in smat (associated motion and
predicative class), and a discussion of the various strategies—inflectional or not—
by which the language may encode the number feature of participants from within
the PP.
Chapter 6 deals with the morphology and the functional distribution of the
smat deictic verb, whose meaning can be roughly glossed as ‘to do thus’. The deictic verb, although it inflects for the exact same categories as regular PPs, features
a unique, completely irregular inflectional paradigm, which is the main reason why
it is treated in a separate chapter.
Finally, Chapter 7 explores at length one aspect of the morphosyntax of the
clause in smat, specifically the expression of negative polarity.
This grammatical description additionally features three appendices.
Appendix A contains the contextualized and fully-interlinearized transcription
of a 22-minute long recording of episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa
and his children as told in smat by Loida Ángel Ruiz. The main chapters of this
work regularly refer to segments of this text, where grammatical phenomena under
discussion can be observed in a fully explicit discursive context.
Appendix B provides for reference an exhaustive glossary of the lexical morphemes mentioned anywhere in this grammatical description.
Finally, Appendix C summarizes in French the main findings of this study.
Note that an exhaustive index of the grammatical morphemes mentioned anywhere in this work is featured at the end of the volume.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"6.1Semantics and syntaxThe verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ is semantically vague and may in principle refer
to virtually any kind of process. It will consequently be found with such diverse
translations as ‘do (like that), move (like that), say (like that), ask (like that), call
(like that), sound (like that), think (like that), decide (like that), etc.’.285 Its one and,
most of the time, stable semantic (and pragmatic) feature is its deictic function.
This deictic component may essentially target (or one might say “point at”) two
different kinds of objects, some of a linguistic (or minimally vocalic) nature, others
of an extra-linguistic nature. Note that the elements targeted by the deictic verb
are marked out by square brackets in all the examples presented throughout this
chapter.
In the first case, the ‘doing thus’ targets a piece of linguistic discourse as such
(i.e. primarily as a signifier in the Saussurean sense), or occasionally a non-linguistic
vocalic production (e.g. a melody), just produced or soon to be produced by the
speaker. The deictic verb can then be said to fulfill an endophoric function.286
This is not to say that the deictic verb is a filler, i.e. a semantically-empty verb whose only
function is to fill in the morphosyntactic position of a predicative phrase in cases where a speaker
finds him or herself unable to—or does not want to—use a semantically-determined predicative
phrase. This predicative-phrase-filler function is carried out by the interrogative-indefinite word åkǘ
‘what?.ns’ (or its extended variant /åkǘ-ʼǘ̃/ ‘what?.ns\sbjv?-rel.ns’), as in the following example:
285̃́ ǘkùchí.

ǘ-kùchí
put.sg-in.sg‘[...] and I, uh... [lit. ‘and I somethinged ...’] I put a rubber band around it.’ [rca F42–43]
From Lyons’ perspective, this kind of deictic reference would possibly be analyzed as “pure
textual deixis” (like the kind of deictic reference involved by it in e.g. That’s a rhinoceros. – A what?

me.’].’ [jgs 730–734]
According to the nature of the endophoric target, which may be a mere name, a
complete utterance, a non-uttered cognitive content, an onomatopoeia, etc., the
deictic verb will be respectively translatable as ‘call target’ (as in example (581)),
‘say target’ (582), ‘think target’ (580), ‘make target’ (583), etc. The deictic
verb is especially pervasive in its use as a device introducing direct speech,
although direct speech does not obligatorily require its presence.

The target of the deictic component of the deictic verb may be, on the other
hand, a strictly extra-linguistic process. This is typically a gesture performed by
the speaker while they are uttering the deictic verb, but it may also be any physical
process being achieved by some other entity present in the utterance situation and
5026.1. Semantics and syntax
‘[...] when [the jaguar] took a step, it made “Flau!” [as its movements
cause some air to be ejected through a flute that was thrust into its anus].
It took another step and went “Flau! Flau!”’ [lar D166–168]
In this construction, the deictic verb functions as a semantically-empty auxiliary
verb whose only morphosyntactic function is to bear the encoding of the inflectional
values of the whole predicative phrase it forms together with the verbal lexeme that
constitutes its core object. Parallel examples by other speakers are needed, however, to confirm the status of this syntactic strategy as a genuine, grammaticalized
construction.
Interestingly, whether the target of the deictic verb is a piece of discourse, a gesture, an anaphoric, or a non-finite verb, its exact syntactic function cannot be established with certainty. As a corollary, whether the deictic verb is morphosyntactically intransitive or transitive appears to be an unanswerable question.
From a strictly morphosyntactic perspective, nothing definitively precludes from
analyzing the deictic verb’s target as a core object, since core objects in smat are
in the zero-case, i.e. are left morphologically unmarked for their syntactic function.
Thus, there is the possibility that the anaphoric ngēmà ‘that’ in example (585),
which stands in the zero-case, is indeed to be interpreted as the core object argument of the deictic verb. On the other hand, no language internal facts seem
to offer positive evidence for the analysis of the deictic verb’s target as its object.
Regular predicative phrases can be unequivocally told to be transitive or intransitive depending on whether or not they require the indexation of a core object in
contexts where, all other things being equal, they are not preceded by any syntactic NP (in the zero-case) that might function as their core object (thus fè ‘to
shoot’ in /kŏwǘ ná=fè/ [deer 3m/n/ns.sbj=shoot] ‘she/he shot the deer’ can be
definitively identified as a transitive verb because */ná=fè/ is not acceptable as
is with the meaning ‘he shot (it)’, which can only be conveyed by /ná=nā=fè/
[3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot], i.e. with the inclusion of an object index).
The inflectional paradigm of the deictic verb does not seem to display any marking
for object indexes, but this cannot be taken as definitive evidence for the verb’s
intransitive nature due to its morphological uniqueness in the language (see Section 6.2). In principle, it might simply be that the deictic verb, although transitive,
has the unique morphological ability to occur without an object index in contexts
where it lacks an object NP preceding it. These considerations leave open the
question of the syntactic relationship, if any, that holds between the deictic
verb and its target in smat. This is why I have opted for labeling the target with
a syntactically neuter term, instead of referring to as e.g. a complement.
5056. The deictic verb
The subject of the deictic verb is typically an animate referent, as in most
examples in this section, or less frequently a concrete, inanimate referent. But
it may also occasionally be an abstract entity, such as a speech, a story, a call,
a song, a thought, a person’s mind, etc. In such cases, the deictic verb does not,
strictly speaking, refer to a process (‘do thus’) being carried out by the subject. It can
rather be considered in practice as the equivalent of an equative verb, and functions
more specifically as a deictic equative verb (‘be thus’). Its specialized use is then
to introduce a linguistic, cognitive, or vocalic object that is being equated with
the subject. This is illustrated in example (618), where the ‘speaking’ (déʼà) that
is taking place is equated with, or defined as, the question enclosed in quotation
marks (see also example (594) below):

were their words [lit. ‘... thus did their speaking.’].’ [lar C404–405]
In addition to a subject argument, the deictic verb may optionally take an argument marked for the accusative case (to be distinguished from a core object,
which does not bear any syntactic-function marking, as mentioned above) in cases
where it specifically refers to an uttering-process (i.e. a piece of linguistic discourse
actually spoken). The referent of that argument is the addressee of the utteringprocess mentioned by the speaker. This is illustrated at the end of example (582)
above. Note that such accusative arguments may only consist of explicit nps as they
cannot be indexed on the deictic verb.
When used endophorically, the deictic verb is virtually always immediately
adjacent to the piece of linguistic discourse (or non-linguistic vocalic production) it points at. As a consequence, its arguments—whether a subject or a
complement in accusative—normally precede the deictic verb when the latter itself
5066.1. Semantics and syntax
precedes its target ((sbj) (acc) deictic.verb “target”). This is illustrated in the
following example (see also the beginning of example (582) above):289
(589)[...] tüʼ̂ ü̃̄ ãʼ̄ a gá ñâʼü:̃́ “Kū-chòʼpḛʼe mā níì-ĩ ̊ kùmà!” ñâʼü̃́ [...]

136]
Conversely, the arguments of the deictic verb normally follow the latter when it
itself follows its target (“target” deictic.verb (lk=sbj) (acc), or “target” deictic.verb (acc) (lk=sbj)).290 This is illustrated in the following example (see
also the end of example (582) above).

[jsg B264–265]
This strong ordering tendency, combined with the fact that the deictic verb cannot
bear indexes for syntactic functions other than subject, regularly leads to the otherwise relatively unusual presence of main constituents bearing case-marking (in this
See example (268), however, for an utterance in which the deictic verb (which precedes its
target) is exceptionally separated from it by its subject argument.
289Note that the linker regularly introduces such postposed subjects, as they have necessarily
already been referred to within the clause through the encoding of the subject argument included
in the inflected deictic verb. By contrast, complements in the accusative post-posed to the deictic
verb are usually not introduced by the linker, as they are then being referred to for the first time
within the clause (they cannot have been already referred to through indexation on the inflected
deictic verb, in particular). On the syntactic distribution of the linker, see Section 3.5.
2905076. The deictic verb
case, accusative case-marking) after an inflected predicative phrase. In other contexts, when a main nominal constituent occurs after an inflected predicative phrase,
dependent-marking on that constituent is typically avoided in favor of other strategies such as head-marking on the inflected predicative phrase (see Section 3.6.1).
As was noted above, the deictic verb is by far the most favored device resorted
to for introducing direct speech. Semantically more specific utterance verbs rarely
fulfill this function by themselves. It is therefore not rare for the deictic verb to
co-occur with a semantically more specific verb in what can be analyzed as
a unique case of serial-verb construction in the language. This construction
facilitates the use of semantically specific utterance verbs as (co-)introducers of
direct speech. In this construction, two finite predicative phrases featuring the
same subject and referring to the same event follow each other with no intonational
break. One of the two finite predicative phrases is the deictic verb (always inflected
in sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/). It is preceded by its endophoric target (e.g. a complete utterance in
direct speech), or occasionally followed by it, in cases where it occurs second of the
two finite predicative phrases. The other finite predicative phrase (which is, for
its part, freely inflected in any of the three Inflectional Types) refers lexically to a
specific type of uttering process (‘to say’, ‘to ask’, ‘to answer’, ‘to call’, ‘to rebuke’,
etc.). In most cases, the two predicative phrases involved in this construction are
arranged in the order just suggested:
[target] deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP1 specific.uttering.processPP2
although the opposite ordering also occurs:
specific.uttering.processPP1 deictic.verb.sbjv-ʼü̃́PP2 [target]
Examples (591) and (592) feature typical instances of this construction. Note that
the two finite predicative phrases in the construction under discussion may be separated by enclitics (such as /=ãʼ̄ a/ ‘quot’, which may occur between all sorts of
constituents in the language, and /=gá/ ‘pst’, which usually behaves as a secondposition clitic, in (591)) or by complements of the one that refers to a specific
uttering process (such as /tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ [3s-acc] ‘him’ in (592)).

Example (593) displays a variant of this construction in which the finite predicative
phrase that refers to a specific uttering process takes an expletive non-salientive
comitative complement /ná-máʼa/ (3n/ns-com), lit. ‘with it’. This complement
is anaphorically coreferential with the target and redundantly refers to the piece
of direct speech “with which” (i.e. uttering which) the specific uttering process is
performed.291

For what is likely an instance of the construction under discussion displaying the
rarer of its two ordering variants mentioned above (with the deictic verb occurring after, instead of before, the predicative phrase referring to a specific uttering
process), see example (596) below.
Note that the comitative relational noun /-máʼa/ is similarly used to mark e.g. the name argument of the verb ū (pcØ) ‘to call someone or something (Core obj) something (com)’. This morphosyntactic observation regarding a semantically comparable kind of predicative phrase supports
the analysis I propose for the complement námáʼa ‘with it’ optionally occurring in the construction
under discussion in the present section.
2915096. The deictic verb
Of all the interrogative-indefinite words, only ñùʼ(u), which I gloss as ‘what
activity?’, may occupy the syntactic position of target of the deictic verb. Åkǘ
‘what?.ns’ and ñùʼãk̀ ǜ ‘how?’, in particular, are not available in this position. Conversely, ñùʼ(u) may only occur as the target of the deictic verb, for which it serves as
a specialized interrogative-indefinite.292 In practice, ñùʼ(u) is most of the time realized in its shortened variant ñùʼ, especially by younger speakers (on this phonologically exceptional form featuring a glottal stop that surfaces in word-final position
without being followed by an epenthetic vowel, see Section 2.1.3.1). It always
immediately precedes the deictic verb. The following example features an instance
of ñùʼ(u) in its interrogative function:
(594)̄
̃́
?”
“Ñùʼù ñâʼü̃́ i ̀ kúãʼ̋ è, nágù kùrǖ-ĩnǜʼü
ñùʼùñâ-ʼü̃́i ̀=kú-ãʼ̋ èná-gùwhat.activity? do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-sub lk.ns=2sg-mind 3n/ns-ploc̄

your mind do like, [what does] what you’re thinking about [do like]?’]”’
[igs 227–228]
Although it is undoubtedly derived from the deictic verb, the invariable vagueness marker ñâʼü̃́ ‘about, something like’ is better treated as distinct from it from
a strictly synchronic perspective. This marker occurs at the end of an NP whose
literal meaning it qualifies as being only an indicative approximation used for establishing a vague referent. In most cases, this NP is a Spanish phrase inserted by
code-mixing, as in the following example:
(595)Nárǖ-ngǜgǘ, eh... hasta las cinco de la tarde ñâʼü.̃́
ná=rǖ=ngǜ-gǘhasta las cinco de la tarde ñâʼü̃́3m/n/ns.sbj=pcrǖ=rest-pl until.five.p.m.something.like‘[In a typical day, tourists do this and that. Then they come back.] They
rest, uh... like until five p.m.’ [jgs 158–159]
Although ñùʼ(u) is also present etymologically in the synchronically unanalyzable interrogativè ǜ/ ‘man’), ñùʼgù ‘when?’
indefinite words ñùʼãk̀ ǜ ‘how?’ (etymologically composed of ñùʼ(u) and /-ãk
(from ñùʼ(u) and /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’ or /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’), and ñùʼré ‘how much? how many?’ (from ñùʼ(u) and
a bound morpheme */-ʼré/ ‘amount?’, on which see note 218).
2925106.2. Inflectional morphology
This marker ñâʼü̃́ likely arose through the grammaticalization of the sequence ‘target’ /ñâ-ʼǘ̃/ (“target’ do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-rel.ns’), lit. ‘what they call
‘target”.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516]"
"3394. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase4.3.4NP+bound noun: ‘to have one’s Y that has X’The combination of an entire NP with in principle any bound noun may
occasionally be employed as an intransitive non-verbal PP indicating that the
referent corresponding to the bound noun (which has a semantic role of possessee
with respect to the subject referent) possesses or features the referent corresponding
to the NP. In other words, these morphosyntactically and semantically intricate
non-verbal PPs can be generally glossed in English as ‘to have one’s Y that has X’,
involving a relation of possession embedded within another relation of possession.
The non-verbal PPs formed in this way may usually be analyzed as possessive
non-verbal PPs in /-ã/̰ ‘poss’ (on which see the previous section) that additionally feature possessee incorporation involving a bound noun having the semantic role of the subject (on possessee incorporation, see Section 4.2.5.2, p.323).
Thus, the meaning of /tá=ná-ya̋e ̄-pǜtà/ (3s.sbj=3n/ns-hair-tooth) ‘he had his
teeth that had hairs’ in example (366) could probably be equivalently expressed
as ? /tü̂-mà-pǜtà ná=ná-ya̋e-̄ ã/̰ (3s-anaph-tooth 3m/n/ns.sbj=3n/ns-hair-poss)
‘his teeth had hairs’, i.e. rephrased using possessive predication in /-ã/̰ ‘poss’ with
the initially incorporated bound noun /-pǜtà/ ‘tooth’ moved to the syntactic position of subject.240

deontic modality, with a first person subject and a fourth person subject respectively (see (477) and (467) above for instances of deontic sbjv-ʼü̃́ involving a second

(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. Apart from main clauses, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is found in
two major kinds of dependent clauses:
– it is obligatory in adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ (‘it being the case
that …’), /…-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’ (‘in order to …’), and ēka̰/ka̰ … ‘so that …’ (or
‘while …’);
– it is obligatory in complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’.
4225.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
The frequent and semantically vague adverbial clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ are roughly comparable to English gerundive clauses, hence the possibility of generally glossing them as ‘it being the case that …’. They may take a wide
array of circumstantial meanings and are often ambiguous. Their exact interpretation relies heavily on the linguistic and extra-linguistic context. Common possible
translations of these adverbial clauses in English include ‘when …, once …, while
…, as …, because …, although …’. These clauses may also occasionally bear no
clear semantic or discursive relation to their context (as in e.g. (T155)). The use
of the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ to introduce them is not optional. The following two examples illustrate this type of adverbial clauses featuring predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́:
(489)Wâʼí náʼa consorciowa̋ chà-pūrāküʼ̋ ü̃́ rǜ mārǖ i ̋chā-ṹʼü̃̀ náwa̋.

Purpose adverbial clauses (‘in order to …’) involve a predicative phrase in
sbjv-ʼü̃́ to which the relational noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘cause’ is attached. This is shown in
example (491). These clauses are often—but not obligatorily—introduced by the
̃́
conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’. Note that in rare occasions, clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
may be used to express reason (‘because …’) rather than purpose.

Among younger speakers (e.g. jsg, igv), such clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
are also
frequently used as mere complement clauses of predicates involving volitive
modality (i.e. predicates with meanings such as ‘to want to …’, ‘to invite to …’, ‘to
tell to …’, ‘to ask to …’, etc.), as shown in example (492).

In this context, however, clauses in sbjv-ʼü-ka̰
seem to be an emerging and still
rarer alternative for the regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ discussed
further in this section (or, in specific cases, for the command complement clauses
in rǜ … ‘and’, on which see Section 5.2.5 above).
Sbjv-ʼü̃́ is also of systematic use in the semantically vague adverbial clauses
in ēka̰/ka̰ … ‘so that …, while …’, as illustrated in the following example:
(493)̃́
“Pà mā, pà mā, kū-tṵ̈kǘ ka̰ kūī-déʼàèchāʼü?”

Regular complement clauses consist in a clause that is introduced by the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ and includes a predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́ (on rare
4245.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
complement clauses including a predicative phrase in bare sbjv, see Section 5.2.5;
on complement clauses of volitive predicates optionally marked with the relational
noun /-ʼka̰/ ‘caus’, see above in the present section). Such complement clauses
may function syntactically as either subjects (as in example (494)), (core) objects,
or any non-core participant required by the valency of the predicative phrase (as
in (495)).

The exact syntactic role of regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ is
sometimes unclear, as in (496), where a complement clause functions as a syntactically indeterminate complement of the intransitive phasal verb ũĉ hi ̀gǜ ‘continue’

Regular complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may also be topicalized and thus
occur in extra-syntactic position. In this specific case, the conjunction náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ …
‘conj’ is frequently dropped, as in the following example:

As shown in examples (494–496), complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’
that are syntactically integrated in a matrix clause regularly follow the predicative
phrase of that matrix clause. Most of the time, an expletive cataphoric third
person non-salientive pronominal form (whether a free pronominal form, or
an index occurring within the predicative phrase as in (494–495)) precedes, or
is included in, the predicative phrase of the matrix clause and fills the syntactic
position of the complement clause (compare English ‘it is true that …’, ‘it is hard
to ...’).
Complement clauses in náʼa/ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ … ‘conj’ may complement an extremely diverse range of predicative phrases involving notions such as utterance (‘say that …,
ask what …, etc.’), cognition (‘know that …, think that …, etc.’), perception (‘see
that …, hear that …, etc.’), emotion (‘be afraid to …, enjoy doing, etc.’), volitive
modality (‘want to …, order to …, etc.’), or phasal aspect (‘continue to …, finish
doing, etc.’), among others.
(iii) Uses not related to clause type. Clauses in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are involved as
components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing
constituents other than subject and (core) object arguments (on the strategy applied for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments, see Section 5.2.5 above).
Constituents with any syntactic function (e.g. comitative in example (498), punctual locative in (499), manner in (491) above) and of any syntactic complexity
(whether a simplex or complex NP as in (498–499) or a full dependent clause as in
(500), repeated from (426 above)) may be focalized via this strategy.

This focalization strategy, apart from its regular and expected use for information structure management, is involved in a non-optional, essentially grammaticalized way in the second person prohibitive construction, which probably comes
historically from a focalization construction exerting focus on the negative particle
tãů ‘neg’. This construction is illustrated in the following example:

shown in (498–500) above. On the second person prohibitive construction, see
Section 7.7.
As was mentioned at the end of Section 5.2.5 above, the focalization of interrogative constituents in any syntactic function is optional but frequent in content
interrogative utterances, as shown in example (502) (see also (485) above). In
practice, interrogative utterances featuring such focalization of the interrogative
constituent do not seem to contrast in any significant way from corresponding utterances that do not feature focalization, as in (459) above.

(ind; slots 4–8)This and the next two sections give a detailed account of the inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase by Inflectional Type, starting with ind
(Section 5.3), then going on to imp (5.4), and finishing with sbjv (5.5).","[426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433]"
"Table 42. Set of “basic” morphemes available in slots 4 to 7 of the inflectional template
of the predicative phrase in indAn important definitional property of ind is that it requires slot 4 to be filled
(slots 5–7, on the other hand, may be left empty). In other words, a predicative
phrase inflected in ind must minimally contain a subject index in order to be grammatical. This property is to be contrasted with the obligatory absence of subject
index in imp, and the possible absence of subject index in sbjv under specific conditions.
Table 42 further manifests the following contrasts between the inflectional morphology of ind and that of sbjv:
– indexes for third person masculine/neuter/non-salientive, third person feminine, and fourth person subjects are available in slot 4 in ind, while no corresponding indexes are available in slot 4 in sbjv (the encoding of such subject
indexes therefore has to rely on less straightforward morphological strategies
in sbjv; see Section 5.5, p.442);
– the indexation of a third person salientive subject and that of a fourth person
subject are formally identical in ind, while they are distinguished in sbjv;
– the only morpheme available in slot 7 in ind (as well as in imp) always encodes a third person (masculine/neuter/non-salientive) object index, while
in sbjv the morphemes available in slot 7 may index either a third person
(masculine/neuter/non-salientive/feminine) subject index or a third person
(masculine/neuter/non-salientive) object index;
– slot 8 is not available in the inflectional template of ind (as well as in that of
imp), while it is available in that of sbjv.
4295. Inflection of the predicative phrase
Part of the morphemes in Table 42 may be combined in a simple, concatenative fashion. Thus, the combination of the inflectional morphemes /chā=/
‘1sg.sbj’ + /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ straightforwardly yields the phonological form /chā=
rǖ=/, as in /chā=rǖ=ngǜ/ ‘I rest’. Likewise, the combination of /kū=/ ‘2sg.sbj’
+ /yà=/ ‘am’ + /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ straightforwardly yields /kū=yà=rǖ=/, as in
/kū=yà=rǖ=ngǜ/ ‘you (sg.) go and rest’. These fully predictable, concatenative
morphological combinations require no further comment.
However, an important number of potential combinations of the morphemes
featured in Table 42 are strongly dispreferred or plainly ungrammatical, with synchronically unanalyzable, fusional morphemes being used in their stead. These
fusional morphemes are dealt with in Sections 5.3.2 through 5.3.4.
Also, the encoding of associated motion within a predicative phrase initially
belonging to the predicative classes pci ̄ or pci ̀ has the unpredictable effect of reassigning these predicative phrases to pcrǖ. The same observation could be expressed differently by saying that the combination of the associated motion marker
/yà=/ with the predicative class markers /i ̄=/ and /i ̀=/ is morphologically ungrammatical, with different, unpredictable combinations of morphemes being used
instead of the expected combinations. This issue is discussed in Section 5.3.5.

in ind, see Charts A–D in Section 5.6, pp.449–450.","[434, 435]"

383Introduction to the structure of the smat
predicative phraseA general outline of the structure of the smat predicative phrase (PP) is provided in Figure 22. This chapter essentially discusses all the morphological phenomena that operate within the structural level delimited by the red box in this
figure. Specifically, it introduces the major types of PPs occurring in the language,
i.e. the verbal PP and the non-verbal PP. It further describes both the derivational morphology specific to the verbal PP (which includes derivation proper
as well as incorporation of nominal constituents) and the derivational morphology shared by verbal and non-verbal PPs. The morphological phenomena that
operate at the structural level delimited by the black dashed-line box in Figure 22
correspond to the inflectional morphology of the finite PP. They are treated separately in Chapter 5.
As was just mentioned, PPs are distributed in two major types, the verbal PP and
the non-verbal PP (corresponding to the two innermost black boxes in Figure 22).
Verbal PPs may consist of a verb root alone, as in example (274):
(274)chā=ná=chi ́1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=bite‘it bit me’They may alternatively consist of a morphologically complex verb stem, i.e. a verb
root attached with one (and only one) derivational suffix of the verb root.
Thus, the PP in (275) is a verb stem composed of the same verb root as the PP in
2834.1. Introduction to the predicative phrase
such a PP, involving an NP attached with the possessive suffix /-ã/̰ specifically, is
provided in (277):
(277)ná=kūchi ̀-ã̰3m/n/ns.sbj=pork-poss‘she/he has a pork/porks’
Both of these verbal and non-verbal “basic” PPs (blue box in Figure 22) may
be further attached with one or several derivational suffixes of the PP, resulting
in “extended” PPs (red box in Figure 22). For instance, as shown in (278a–278e),
any of the basic PPs in (274–277) above may take the plural derivational suffix of
the predicative phrase /-gǘ/:
(278)a. chā=ná=chi ́-gǘ1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=bite-pl‘they bit me’b. chā=ná=chi ́-à-gǘ1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=bite-plloc-pl‘they bit me in different parts [of my body]’
c. chā=ná=chi ́-kùtü-̄ gǘ
1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=bite-foot-pl‘they bit me in the foot/feet’
d. chā=ná=chi ́-à-kútü-̄ gǘ1sg.acc=3m/n/ns.sbj=bite-plloc-foot-pl‘they bit me in different parts of my foot/feet’
e. ná=kūchi ̀-ã-̰ gǘ
3m/n/ns.sbj=pork-poss-pl‘they have a pork/porks’Although the ordering “verbal derivation + incorporation + derivation of the
PP” within the verbal PP is indeed the one observed in an overwhelming majority
of cases, note that it may exceptionally occur for an incorporated bound noun
to precede verbal derivation, as in (279) (where the bound noun /-gà/ ‘sound’
precedes what appears to be the pluractional derivational suffix of the verb root
/-gǜ/), or to follow PP derivation, as in (476) (where the bound noun /-e̋gà/
‘name’ follows what appears to be the plural derivational suffix of the predicative
phrase /-gǘ/):

[lit. ‘until they were finished that he made them names that way’] [...].’
[lar C418]
A possible—although not definitive—way to account for the ordering observed in
(279–476), considering that the two PPs under scrutiny are attested elsewhere in
my data and cannot be discarded as accidental hapaxes, is to hypothesize that the
historically complex forms /ã(̄ -)gà/ ‘to make a sound’ and /ü̆(-)gǘ/ ‘to make (pl.)’
might have been lexicalized to the point of being optionally treated as morphologically simplex verb roots in today’s language.
I have not investigated in a systematic fashion the relative ordering of the suffixes indiscriminately analyzed here as belonging to the derivational morphology
of the PP. This morphological domain clearly features some ordering variation,
especially as far as the relative position of the plural suffix /-gǘ/ is concerned (see
e.g. the attested orderings /-èchà-gǘ/∼/-gǘ-èchà/ and /-chi ̀gǜ-gǘ/∼/-gǘ-chi ̀gǜ/ in
cases where /-gǘ/ co-occurs with the persistive /-èchà/ and the singular distributive
/-chi ̀gǜ/, respectively). Strong ordering tendencies can also be observed, however, including regarding the relative position of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’. For instance, /-gǘ/
virtually always comes after the intransitive plural suffix /-ē/ when both co-occur
within the same PP, yielding in most cases the immediate sequence /-ē-gǘ/. It is
likely that a thorough examination of all cases of co-occurrences of derivational
suffixes of the PP in a smat corpus would uncover more ordering tendencies or
constraints of the kind just mentioned. Certain ordering variations might also be
revealed to be regularly meaningful. In any case, note, importantly, that in Section 4.4, where these morphemes are dealt with, they are grouped according to
2864.1. Introduction to the predicative phrase
general semantic criteria rather than following a hypothetical morphological
template that might underlie their organization. The presentational order of Section 4.4 should therefore not be interpreted as corresponding to any underlying
morphological organization of the suffixes under discussion.
Before passing to the description of the various types of smat PPs and their
derivational morphology, a brief definitional notice is in order. Although the description of the inflectional morphology of the finite PP is deferred to the next
chapter, note, crucially, that it is what provides an operational criterion for defining what I simply refer to as a PP throughout the present chapter. I generally
define as a PP any phrase that may directly (i.e. without any morphological
modification) receive inflectional morphology of the finite PP.
Example (281) is intended to briefly illustrate how I put this definition to use
in practice. In this example, the speaker is telling how his wife and his daughter,
after prepaying for a bed, go pick it up from the store’s depository:
(281)Ngēmàka̰ tá-tåʼēgǘ rǜ nge̋mà méʼe ná-ĩ ̂ rǜ nā-üt̆ ànǜãʼ̀ ü̃́ chírḛ.
ngē-mà-ka̰tá=[tåʼē-gǘ]ná=[ĩ ̂]rǜrǜnge̋-mà=méʼemed.ns-anaph-cause 3s.sbj=trade-pl and med.aloc-anaph=dub3m/n/ns.sbj=go.pl andnā=[ü-̆ tànǜ]-ã-̀ ʼü̃́=chírḛ3f.sbj.sbjv=make-compensation-3m/n/ns.obj\sbjv-sub=aprf‘They bought that [i.e. the bed] and I guess they went there, and she had
already payed for it.’ [jsg B451–452]
This example contains three PPs, which are individually enclosed in square brackets. The left boundaries of all three are straightforwardly delimited by the inflectional proclitics /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj’, /ná=/ ‘3m/n/ns.sbj’,228 and /nā=/ ‘3f.sbj.sbjv’,
respectively. Because a PP minimally consists of one syllable, the location of the
right boundary of the second PP, i ̃̂, is obvious. The right boundary of the third PP,
/ü̆-tànǜ/, is, like its left boundary, clearly manifested by inflectional morphology, in
this case by the inflectional suffix /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’. Importantly, this leaves out
of that PP the last morpheme in the utterance, /=chi ́rḛ/ ‘aprf’. In such a context,
In fact, /tá=i/̃̂ ‘they went’, with the same proclitic /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj’ as in /tá=tåʼē-gǘ/ ‘they
bought’, would have been expected in example (281) if, as is most likely the case, the subjects of
both of these finite PPs share the same referent.
2282874. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
this /=chi ́rḛ/ can be unequivocally distinguished from the homonymous derivational suffix of the PP /-chi ́rḛ/ ‘admittedly’, which would have been positioned to
the left of /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’. Finally, the right boundary of the first PP, /tåʼē-gǘ/,
cannot be established from (281) alone, but simple morphosyntactic tests show it to
correspond to the right edge of the phonological word it belongs to. For instance,
when the context of this finite PP is manipulated so as to cause it to shift from the
Indicative Inflectional Type to the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, it is its last syllable
that is affected by the morphotonological alternations triggered by the Subjunctive
Inflectional Type (on the notion of Inflectional Type, see Section 5.2.1; on the
morphotonological alternations triggered by the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, see
Section 2.6.2.1). This syllable can therefore be deduced to be the last of the PP.
As shown in example (282), the exact same PP precisely happens to be produced by
the same speaker immediately before the utterance in (281) in a context where it
occurs in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, allowing the diagnostics just mentioned
to be applied to identify the right boundary of the PP /tåʼē-gǘ/ in (281):
(282)Tôʼrī camaka̰ tà-tåʼēgüʼ̋ ü,̃́ tâʼü,̃́ familiar.
tô-ʼrīcama-ka̰ tà=[tåʼē-gü̋ ]-ʼü̃́tâ-ʼü̃́familiar1pl-gen bed-cause 3s.sbj\sbjv=trade-pl\sbjv-sub be.big\sbjv-rel.ns familial‘They bought a bed for us, a big one, a double bed.’ [jsg B449–450]
Importantly, note that applying the definition of the PP just discussed in a systematic way leads me to include among the derivational suffixes of the PP
three morphemes that are homonymous with enclitics, specifically /-chi ̀gǜ/
‘distr.sg’ (compare /=chi ̀gǜ/ ‘distr.sg’), /-mārē/ ‘just’ (compare /=mārē/ ‘just’),
and /-chi ́rḛ/ ‘admittedly’ (compare /=chi ́rḛ/ ‘aprf’). In fact, although the meaning of these suffixes is largely similar to that of their homonymous enclitics (with
which these suffixes are obviously cognate), they do not exactly overlap, which
further suggests to analyze these three suffixes and their corresponding enclitics as
distinct morphemes. Thus, if the last PP in (281) had contained the suffix /-chi ́rḛ/
‘admittedly’ instead of being followed by the enclitic /=chi ́rḛ/, the meaning of the
corresponding clause would have been ‘although she payed for it, ...’ instead of ‘she
had already payed for it’.
This chapter is organized as follows. Verbal PPs, i.e. verb roots, most of their
specific derivational morphology, and the incorporation of nominal constituents
into verbal PPs, are the topics of Section 4.2. The various subtypes of nonverbal PPs are discussed in Section 4.3. The derivational morphology of the
PP, i.e. the derivational suffixes that may generally be attached to both verbal and
2884.2. Verbal predicative phrases
non-verbal PPs, is dealt with in Section 4.4 for the most part. Finally, the derivational morphemes that operate on PPs’ valency (i.e. two derivational suffixes
of the verb root and two derivational suffixes of the PP) are treated separately
in Section 4.5, together with two valency-manipulating constructions lacking
specialized morphological marking.","[288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294]"
"However, in the speech of most speakers, sbjv-ʼü̃́ is regularly used in declarative main clauses to present a process as constituting a new, salient step within
a temporal sequence of processes. sbjv-ʼü̃́ is then resorted to as a discursive device that allows the speaker to explicitly construct a clear temporal axis along which
major steps are grammatically signaled as such as they are being mentioned. Such
uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses could be roughly glossed by ‘at that
point, …’, as was done in the translation of example (448d) above. By contrast,
non-sequential processes, or minor sequential processes that the speaker does
not want to present as sequenced, are referred to with predicative phrases in ind.
In other words, predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ essentially correspond to those that
involve what I call advancement of narrative time ([+ant]), while predicative phrases in ind essentially correspond to those that do not involve advancement of narrative time ([-ant]). An important consequence is that predicative
phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses may not be uttered in a different
order without typically implying a different sequence for the processes referred to,
i.e. the ordering of [+ant] forms conditions the semantic interpretation of the
processes referred to. By contrast, predicative phrases in ind in declarative main
clauses may be uttered in a different order with no direct implication as to the sequence of the processes referred to, i.e. the ordering of [-ant] forms has no effect
on the semantic interpretation of the processes referred to. Note that the ordering of [-ant] forms does, by contrast, condition the discursive—more specifically,
the rhetorical—interpretation of utterances, as it obviously has direct effects on
the order in which the information is delivered and construed and the way it is
rhetorically organized.259Thus in example (451) below, which contains three main clauses in ind, the enacted speaker
chooses to first make a more generic announcement (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) and then proceeds to make a more specific elaboration on it in the next two utterances (‘I’ll shoot some brown
woolly monkeys. I’ll go woolly-monkey-hunting.’). With the exact same semantic meaning, the
first utterance (‘I’m going to go hunting!’) could presumably have been uttered last, but then that
semantically more generic utterance would have been construed as a summary restatement of the
more specific announcement made in the previous two utterances, yielding a different rhetorical
structure from the one actually at play in (451). Likewise, in (450) below, the ordering of the three
clauses in ind in the answer (‘I’ve shot a beautiful tére̋ parrot, it has fallen down here but I can’t
find it.’) could in principle be altered (as in e.g. ‘A beautiful tére̋ parrot has fallen down here, but
I can’t find it, [in fact] I’ve shot it.’) with no consequences as to their semantic interpretation, but
2594005.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
Typical discourse genres where the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is exploited are
narratives (whether set in a remote past and unrelated to the discourse participants—myths, legends, tales, etc.—or set in a relatively recent past and related to
the discourse participants—life stories, anecdotes, etc.) and procedural discourse
(cooking recipes, descriptions of craft techniques, chronologically-ordered descriptions of the typical activities carried out in a given period of time, etc.). In these
discourse genres, while predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ are used to orderly unroll the
series of major events (or steps to be conducted), predicative phrases in ind are generally employed with one or several of the following six main discursive functions
(the simple illustrative contexts of use in parentheses are made up examples that
parallel actual occurrences in my corpus; actual examples are provided below):260
– locating a major event in space or time (e.g. ‘The next day came.ind. Then
he went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ into the jungle.’);
– mentioning preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a
monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);
– recapitulating a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came down.sbjv-ʼü̃́.
So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);261
such alterations would affect the rhetorical relations that bind them into a small discourse unit.
In practice, in (450), the rhetorical principle that guides the ordering of the clauses in ind under
scrutiny is temporal iconicity, but the use of ind in these clauses indicates that establishing a clear
temporal axis is not essential to the purposes of the enacted speaker at that moment.
Interestingly, when they fulfill one of the first three functions in this list, main declarative
clauses containing a predicative phrase in ind are often explicitly topicalized by means of a topic
marker (/=i ̀/ ‘contr.top’ in non-past contexts or /=gá/ ‘pst’ in past contexts) attached at their
right edge (as in examples (454a) and (455e) below). This clause-level topicalization process could
in fact be argued to turn these clauses into near-dependent clauses (as opposed to genuinely independent main clauses). Note further that all of the six functions in this list are somehow related to
topical (i.e. already known or backgrounded) information, as opposed to the more focal (i.e. unknown or foregrounded) information typically conveyed by declarative main clauses containing a
predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́.
260The use of such recapitulating clauses for discourse cohesion is frequent in narratives and procedural discourse in smat. These recapitulating clauses are of two major formal and functional types.
Some include the predicative phrase of the recapitulated clause more or less verbatim (“recapitulating linkage” proper in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These verbatim (or specific) recapitulating
clauses typically provide linkage from one sentence to the next within a single paragraph and often
imply that the two main processes referred to are temporally close to each other (see e.g. examples (454a–454b) below). Other much more formulaic recapitulating clauses feature an anaphoric
word referring to the processes to be recapitulated (/ngē-mà/ ‘med.ns-anaph’ in past or non-past
2614015. Inflection of the predicative phrase
– initiating a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a man went.ind
into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’);
– elaborating on specific aspects of a major event occurring at the same reference time (e.g. ‘And then they had.sbjv-ʼü̃́ dinner. They chatted.ind, they
drank.ind [i.e. while eating]. Then they went.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to bed.);
– describing participants of a major event (e.g. ‘The canoe was large.ind.’).","[405, 406, 407]"
"4.2.5.1Formal typesFrom a strictly morphological perspective, incorporation in smat corresponds
to two different constructions, bound noun incorporation and NP incorporation.
(i) Bound noun incorporation Bound noun incorporation, a very frequent construction, allows a bound noun (alone, i.e. without the stressed morpheme or stem to which it would necessarily have been attached to occur as a free
syntactic constituent of the main clause in discourse) to be directly attached to
the right edge of a verb root or a verb stem. Because bound nouns are (invariably) unstressed forms in smat, the resulting incorporating verb stem constitutes a
single phonological word.
Illustrations of bound noun incorporation are given in example (328) (on the
identification of the syntactico-semantic types of incorporation provided in parentheses, see next section). Note that certain bound nouns belong to a lexical class of
bound morphemes that cause the morphotonological alternations /43 /→/31 / and

.............................-ãr̀ ǖ .....-ã̰
verb.root/stem-gen NP-poss
In NP incorporation, the incorporated nominal constituent (which, as a well-formed
NP, necessarily bears a stress on its first syllable) retains its stress and consequently constitutes its own phonological word (or several phonological words,
in exceptional cases where the incorporated NP is syntactically complex) together
with the unstressed possessive suffix /-ã/̰ that it bears at its right edge.
Instances of the NP incorporation construction are provided in examples (329–
330) (see also (327) above; these three examples all involve incorporation of the
possessee incorporation functional type, on which see next section). Note that the
suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/ gen belongs to the lexical class of bound morphemes that trigger
the Pattern 2 morphotonological alternations mentioned in the preceding paragraph (hence the forms /mê-ãr̀ ǖ/ [be.good-gen], from mé ‘be good’, in (329) and
/i ̋-ãr̀ ǖ/ [be.small-gen], from i ̰ ‘be small’, in (330)).

The NP incorporation construction is the only one in smat to derive PPs made
of two or more phonological words. It is mostly attested in a single one of the
three syntactico-semantic types of incorporation identified in the following section,
specifically the one I call possessee incorporation.
3204.2. Verbal predicative phrases4.2.5.2Functional typesFrom a syntactic and semantic perspective, I distinguish three major types of
incorporation in smat: core argument incorporation, possessee incorporation,
and non-core participant incorporation.
(i) Core argument incorporation In core argument incorporation, the
semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to the semantic role of
the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object of a transitive verb
root/stem. The subject syntactic position of the intransitive verb root/stem, or the
object syntactic position of the transitive verb root/stem, is “absorbed” by the incorporated constituent. Core argument incorporation consequently decreases the
valency of the verb root/stem: an intransitive one becomes avalent (rare), a transitive one becomes intransitive. Core argument incorporation mostly incorporates
bound nouns (instead of entire NPs, but see (335)).
Only the bound noun /-ànè/ ‘space (i.e. land or sky)’ is attested in my data
to occur as an incorporated bound noun absorbing the subject position of an
intransitive verb root/stem (subject-absorbing incorporation is not attested at all
with an NP as the incorporated constituent). The resulting impersonal incorporating verb stem takes an expletive third person (non-salientive?) subject234 and
denotes a terrain condition (as in (331); see also (T30)), a weather condition (as in
(T105)), or a sky condition corresponding to a specific moment of day or night (as
in (332)235 ).

impersonal verb stem incorporating a subject-absorbing /-ànè/, seems to take ãē̄ màkǖ ‘lightning’ as
its subject.
234Although synchronically unanalyzable, the impersonal verb stem yâànè ‘be twilight’ in (332)
clearly features a fully-lexicalized instance of subject-absorbing incorporation of /-ànè/‘space’.

back to the village.] We arrive at twilight, at the very end of the afternoon
[lit. ‘... really when the sky is green.’?].’ [jgs 72]
Incidentally, the only cases in my data where (genuine) incorporation is applied twice within a single verb stem involve, as a second step, subject-absorbing
incorporation of /-ànè/ ‘space’ (for a case of a verb stem displaying both possessive pseudo-incorporation and possessee incorporation, see example (345)). Thus,
/nà=tá-chi ̋kà-ànē-ʼǘ̃/ (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=be.big-room-space\sbjv-sub) ‘there
was a lot of room’ in (333) can be analyzed as featuring, first, a case of possessee
incorporation (‘[the room]POSSESSEE of the space is big’>‘the space is [room]-big’; on
possessee incorporation, see below) followed by a case of core argument incorporation absorbing a subject syntactic position (‘[the space]SBJ is room-big’>‘itEXPLETIVE
is [space]-room-big’).

nets,] they slept in hammocks and that’s why there [had to] be a lot of room
in a maloca [i.e. so that all would fit in it at night?].”’ [jgs 428–429]
With bound nouns or NPs absorbing the object position of a transitive verb
root/stem, core argument incorporation usually produces verb stems/phrases that
denote relatively well-identified activities regularly practiced in Tikuna culture, as
in example (334) (see also (325) above, and tà-ãʼ̆ pàèʼü̃́ ‘they twisted chambira fiber’
in (T82) and ti ̄-düĝ ùnègüʼ̋ ü̃́ ‘they sharpened darts’ in (T83)).

Example (335) features a rare instance of object-absorbing core argument incorporation involving the incorporation of an NP (instead of a bound noun):

creatures were playing in a river.] The hunter silently leaned his blowgun
against [a tree] and watched them.’ [gsg 1’37”–1’44”]
(ii) Possessee incorporation In possessee incorporation, the semantic role
of the incorporated constituent corresponds, like in core argument incorporation, to
the semantic role of the subject of an intransitive verb root/stem or the object
of a transitive verb root/stem. Possessee incorporation may also occasionally occur in cases where the semantic role of the incorporated constituent corresponds to
that of the complement in the accusative of an intransitive verb root/stem. However, unlike in core argument incorporation, no valency decrease occurs. The
subject, object, or accusative complement syntactic position—respectively—is not
absorbed by the incorporated constituent, but is instead occupied by a participant
that corresponds semantically to the possessor of the incorporated constituent.
3234. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
Thus, in possessee incorporation, the syntactic valency of the verb root/stem remains unchanged, but the mapping of its syntactic valency onto semantic roles is
reorganized. In the case of a transitive verb root/stem, for instance, the presence
of possessee incorporation implies that the participant in object position is not the
patient, but the possessor of the patient, which is itself expressed as the incorporated constituent. Possessee incorporation allows a semantic possessor to be
promoted to the syntactic position of its possessee and, as a result, to benefit
from an increase in discursive salience, in particular over its possessee. Like core
argument incorporation, possessee incorporation may yield relatively lexicalized
incorporating verb stems (involving an incorporated bound noun) denoting wellidentified concepts in the Tikuna culture, but it is generally much more flexible
and productive than core argument incorporation.
Instances of possessee incorporation involving an incorporated constituent whose
possessor occupies the subject position of an intransitive verb root/stem are
provided in examples (336) (bound noun incorporation; see also (328a) above, and
/yŭ-nátǖ/ [die-father] ‘to lose one’s father’ [lit. ‘to father-die’] in (472)) and (337)
(NP incorporation; see also (329) and (330) above).

participant (/chō=/ ‘1sg.acc’), is encoded as a participant in the accusative as
an effect of differential object marking for non-third person masculine/neuter/nonsalientive participants. For an instance of the same functional type of incorporation
involving NP incorporation, see (327) above.

3254. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
(iii) Non-core participant incorporation Finally, in non-core participant incorporation, the semantic role of the incorporated constituent does
not correspond to that of either of the possible core arguments of the verb
root/stem. The interpretation of that semantic role is mostly left to context and
may be delicate to establish with certainty. In most cases, the referent identified
by the incorporated constituent can be broadly interpreted as having the semantic
role of a ground (portion of space proper, as in example (341); container, as in
(342); or vehicle, as in (328b) above) or as characterizing the state reached by
the object of a transitive verb denoting a transformation process (as in (343); see
also (169)). The valency of the verb root/stem and its mapping of syntactic positions with semantic roles are left unaltered. Non-core participant incorporation
virtually always involves the incorporation of bound nouns (not entire NPs). Like
possessee incorporation, non-core participant incorporation may yield relatively
lexicalized incorporating verb stems, although it is generally more flexible and
productive than core argument incorporation.

[jsg B258]4.2.5.3Pseudo-incorporation in possessive predicationPossessive predication of participants expressed as bound nouns exclusively operates through a construction that is formally identical with bound noun incorporation and appears to incorporate the bound noun to the verb roots ã̄ ‘to
have’ (positive possessive predication) or g̃e-̊ ‘not have’ (negative possessive—
or privative—predication, on which see Section 7.2.3). Possessive predication of
participants expressed as NPs may similarly operate through a construction that is
formally identical with NP incorporation and involves the same two verb roots,
although in the case of participants expressed as NPs an alternative construction
involving non-verbal predication is available, and apparently preferred over NP incorporation to ã̄ or g̃e-̊ (on this alternative construction, see Section 4.3.3.6). Note,
however, that the incorporation-like constructions employed for possessive predication are not, strictly speaking, genuine incorporation given that their possessee
participant cannot be extracted from ã̄ or g̃e-̊ so as to be expressed as a separate,
syntactically independent nominal constituent. Furthermore, from a syntacticosemantic perspective, these incorporation-like constructions do not quite fit with
any of the three functional types identified in the previous section. For these reasons, I consider them as cases of pseudo-incorporation, rather than incorporation
proper.
Instances of possessive pseudo-incorporation of a bound noun are provided
in examples (344) and (345).

Note that /kù=ã-̄ ya̋e-̄ pǜtā/ (2sg.sbj\sbjv=have-hair-tooth\sbjv) ‘he [lit.
‘you ...’] had hairs in the teeth’ in (345) can be analyzed as featuring both possessive pseudo-incorporation (‘his teeth have hairs’ literally encoded as ‘his teeth
hair-have’) followed by possessee incorporation (‘his teeth hair-have’>‘he teethhair-has’; on the stylistically-marked use of second person singular marking with
reference to a third person participant to convey a notion of surprise, see Section 3.3.6, p.206).
An instance of possessive pseudo-incorporation of an NP is provided in the
following example:

For instances of pseudo-incorporation employed in privative predication,
see example (347) (the only case of formal incorporation where the (pseudo-)incorporated constituent is a syntactically complex NP in my corpus) and the examples in
Section 7.2.3.

Interestingly, the possessee participant of a positive possessive pseudo-incorporation construction,236 minimally in cases where it is an NP (as opposed to a bound
noun, for which I do not have spontaneous data), may be relativized using a kind
of gapping strategy. The pseudo-incorporated constituent is then dropped and the
possessive suffix /-ã/̰ gets directly attached to the verb stem after the genitive suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/ (as in e.g. /chā=ã-̄ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã̰/ [1sg.sbj=have-gen dog-poss] ‘I have
a dog’ > /(âirű yà=)chà=ã-̄ ãr̀ ǖ-ã̋-ʼè/ [(dog lk.n/s=)1sg.sbj\sbjv=have-genposs\sbjv-rel.s] ‘(the dog) that I have’). Note that gapping is otherwise only resorted to for relativizing participants with a syntactic function of subject or (core)
object in smat, while relativizing participants with any other syntactic function
regularly involves the use of a resumptive pronominal form standing for the pivot
within the relative clause. An instance of relativization of the NP possessee participant of a positive pseudo-incorporation construction is provided in the following

2363294. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
San Martín is [jungle] that is exploited by man [lit. ‘... is [a jungle] that
[people] have worked in already.’]’ [jgs 220–221]4.3Non-verbal predicative phrasesSeveral types of non-verbal predicative phrases are attested in smat. These are
listed in Table 37. They involve the combination of a nominal constituent (a
circumstantial independent noun, a—non-circumstantial—independent noun, or an
entire NP) or an onomatopoeia together with a bound morpheme, which may be
either a suffix (/-ʼü̽̃/ ‘temp.pred’, /-ē/ ‘event.pred’, or /-ã/̰ ‘poss’), a predicative
relational noun (/-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, /-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘like’, /-ʼpḛʼe/ ‘equal’, /-ʼchàʼǜ̃/ ‘vol’, or
/-ʼwa̰e/̄ ‘apprec’ or one of its subdialectal variants), or a bound noun.
From a semantic perspective, the resulting PPs serve for the expression of a
varied array of predication types. The meaning of each formal type of nonverbal predication identified in Table 37 is roughly glossed in the column ‘Resulting
PP’ (with ‘X’ standing for the respective nominal constituent to which the bound
morpheme in the leftmost column of the table is attached in the respective formal
type of non-verbal predication).
Note that, as indicated by plus signs <+> in Table 37, certain of the bound
morphemes that turn a nominal constituent into a non-verbal PP trigger the morphotonological alternation /43 /→/31 / when they are immediately attached to
the Allomorph 1 of a pronominal root featuring a lexical toneme /43 / (a process
that represents an instance of Pattern 2 morphotonological alternation, on which
see Section 2.6.2.2; on the definition of the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots,
see Section 3.3.1). Thus, the combination of the pronominal root /ná-/ ‘3n/ns’
with the predicative relational noun /-ʼchàʼü̃̀/ ‘vol’, for instance, yields the form
/nâ-ʼchàʼǜ̃/, with the lexical toneme /43 / of /ná-/ turning into /31 / (/nâ-/). Note
that, by definition, only bound nouns and relational nouns can be directly attached
to the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots. Suffixes, by contrast with bound nouns
and relational nouns, are defined as bound morphemes that cannot be attached to
the Allomorph 1 of pronominal roots. That is why the bound morphemes in Table 37 that are suffixes, as opposed to bound nouns and relational nouns, feature
the mention ‘n/a’ (for ‘not applicable’) in the column ‘MA trigger’ (for ‘Pattern 2
Morphotonological Alternation trigger’).
The various types of non-verbal predication listed in Table 37 are discussed
and exemplified individually in the next sections (see the corresponding section
3304.3. Non-verbal predicative phrasesC.i.n.+...","[323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"On the other hand, the ind vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast is typically deactivated in
ordinary conversation with reference to recent past, present, or future processes,
i.e. any time the processes referred to are tightly related to the utterance situation
and their temporal order is deemed irrelevant or contextually obvious. Predicative
phrases in declarative main clauses then tend to all be inflected in ind. Ind is
also virtually systematic in non-temporally-ordered descriptions of events, e.g. in a
description of the various activities one carries out or may carry out (in any order)
on a given occasion or more generally in one’s daily life. Crucially, ind is also the
default Inflectional Type for predicative phrases in declarative main clauses
elicited from speakers out of context.
Examples (449–453) illustrate uses of ind in contexts where it does not contrast with sbjv-ʼü̃́. Examples (449–451), firstly, exemplify the default use of ind
in daily conversation strongly anchored in the utterance situation (for a good
understanding of the examples in this section, recall that the glosses of predicative
phrases in ind do not comprise the explicit mention ‘ind’, by contrast with those
of predicative phrases in sbjv(-ʼü̃́), which comprise the mention ‘sbjv’):

‘This was, and ...’; “summary linkage” in Aikhenvald (2019)’s terminology). These formulaic (or
generic) recapitulating clauses often—but not always—provide linkage not between sentences, but
between entire paragraphs of discourse and not infrequently involve a temporal gap between the
two (sequences of) processes referred to (see e.g. (T7) and (T38)). Occasionally, both a formulaic
and a verbatim recapitulating clauses occur consecutively (as in e.g. (T136), where it could be that a
paragraph break is implied by the formulaic recapitulating clause, while actual temporal contiguity
between the preceding and the new paragraph is highlighted by the verbatim recapitulating clause).
For typological discussions and case studies of the use of specific or generic recapitulation clauses
for discursive purposes—a strategy referred to as “tail-head linkage” or “bridge linkage”, among
others—see Guillaume (2011) and Aikhenvald (2019).",[407]

function), in which case it makes no distinction of nominal class, or it may stand
for a partitive object participant, in which case it differs whether it stands for a participant in the masculine, neuter, or non-salientive nominal class (partitive objects
in the feminine or salientive nominal class can never, for their part, be indexed on
the predicative phrase). The third person index in slot 7, which may stand for a
subject or an object argument depending on the context, may only take the values masculine/neuter/non-salientive (m/n/ns) or feminine (f). Incidentally, this
implies that salientive (s) third person subject or object arguments can never be
indexed in slot 7 and that their indexation, in contexts where they would be indexed in slot 7 if they belonged to another nominal class, therefore has to occur in
other slots (specifically in slot 4 in cases where they stand for a subject argument,
and—by a phenomenon of differential object marking—in slot 2 in cases where they
stand for an object argument, in which case they are encoded morphologically as
an accusative participant). The third person (masculine, neuter, or non-salientive)
object index in slot 8 is simply either present or absent. Likewise, the feature of
associated motion encoded in slot 5 is simply either present or absent. Finally, the
values encoded in slot 6 straightforwardly correspond to each of the five predicative classes of the language (note that pcØ, by contrast with the other predicative
classes, is morphologically unmarked in most cases, and that in such cases I do not,
accordingly, state its presence explicitly in glosses).
The following examples (repeated from (446) and (447) above) provide the
mapping of actual occurrences of inflected predicative phrases with the templatic analysis just put forward (the first row of these examples is repeated from
the first row of the figure provided above at the beginning of this section):

(as ‘.imp’, ‘.sbjv’, or ‘\sbjv’—the latter when the phonological exponent of ‘sbjv’ is
tonological). By contrast, where inflectional morphological material of ind is used,
no Inflectional Type gloss is featured (compare the glosses in examples (448a) and
(448c) below, for instance).
Imp is essentially identical to ind, except that it further lacks a slot 4.
Sbjv, by contrast with both ind and imp, does feature a slot 8, and does feature the value f in slot 7. In slot 4, however, sbjv does not feature the values
3m/n/ns, 3f, and 4. Subjects in these person & nominal class combinations are indexed in slot 7 instead. The morphemes used as explicit exponents of sbjv in slots
4 to 7 typically—but not systematically—involve a tonological deviation from
their default shape used in ind, namely a shift to toneme /1 / (as in e.g. /chā=/
‘1sg.sbj(.ind)’ featuring toneme /3 / vs /chà=/ ‘1sg.sbj\sbjv’, with /1 /; or /tá=/
‘3s.sbj(.ind)’ with /4 / vs /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’ with /1 /; but contrast these indexes,
whose toneme shifts to /1 / in sbjv, with the index /pē=/ ‘2pl.sbj(.ind)’, whose
toneme remains identical in sbjv, /pē=/ ‘2pl.sbj(.sbjv)’).
The specific inflectional morphology of each of the three Inflectional Types is
described at length in Sections 5.3–5.5.
Examples (448a–448d) illustrate the kind of morphological distinctions that
obtain between ind, imp, and sbjv. They are also intended to briefly exemplify the
kind of functional contrasts that obtain between ind (448a), imp (448b), sbjv
(448c), and the latter’s frequent combination sbjv-ʼü̃́ (448d), here comparing their
uses in main clauses (note that out of context, the translations provided in (448a–
448d) are no more than indicative translations among several other possibilities;
the function exemplified by each example is indicated in parentheses in the terms
of the functional distribution of the Inflectional Types outlined below in Table 41).

tà=rü=3s.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest\sbjv-sub‘[At that point,] she rests/she rested [specifically in a series of sequenced
processes].’
Note that the imp predicative phrase in (448b) only differs from the ind predicative phrase in (448a) by lacking a subject index in slot 4 (this informative absence
of marking is exceptionally materialized and glossed in this example as /(Ø=)/
‘(imp)’). On the other hand, the bare sbjv predicative phrase in (448c) only differs
from the ind predicative phrase in (448a) at the tonological level. The default subject morpheme /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj(.ind)’ in (448a) is replaced by /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’
in (448c). Note also that the lexical form of the verb ngǜ ‘to rest’ (with a lexical
toneme /21 /) in (448a) undergoes a morphotonological alternation process operating as a further exponent of sbjv and becomes ngʼü̆ (with a derived toneme /CM /) in
(448c). Importantly, the encoding of sbjv at a tonological level only occurs once
among the inflectional proclitics of the predicative phrase. This is why the predicative class morpheme /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ in (448c) remains identical as in (448a), as
sbjv in (448c) is already encoded tonologically on /tà=/ ‘3s.sbj\sbjv’. Finally, as
is self-evident, the sbjv-ʼü̃́ predicative phrase in (448d) further differs from (448a)
by the addition of the subordinator suffix /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’ to the sbjv predicative phrase
as it stands in (448c).
The general functional distribution of the three Inflectional Types proper
and sbjv-ʼü̃́ is summarized in Table 41 ([±ant] in the first rows of this table
stands for presence or absence of advancement of narrative time; on these notions,
see next section). In this table, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions are
listed together. As this table shows, only imp has a single, easily identifiable function. Ind, sbjv, and sbjv-ʼü̃́ occur in a variety of contexts with a variety of functions and display some functional overlap in main clauses. All of these functions
are extensively exemplified and commented upon in the following five sections
(5.2.2–5.2.6).

As a caveat, let me make clear that the terms Indicative, Imperative, and Subjunctive used to refer to the three Inflectional Types are to be understood as little
more than practical, mnemonic labels. Although they are borrowed from the
terminological tradition related to the grammatical category of mood, these labels
are by no means intended to suggest that the categories referred to here as
Inflectional Types can be, beyond a first approximation, identified and adequately described as moods. The functional distribution of ind, imp, and sbjv,
however, is vaguely reminiscent of that of the categories traditionally labeled as indicative, imperative, and subjunctive “moods” in the Romance languages. Because
many readers will presumably be familiar with that somewhat arbitrary terminological tradition, I have opted for applying it to smat’s Inflectional Types (rather
than arbitrarily labeling them as e.g. Inflectional Type 1, Inflectional Type 2, etc.)
with the practical purpose of making it easier for these readers to recognize and
distinguish them.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"
"3.3PronounsThis section deals with the pronominal roots and the different types of nominal
words in the formation of which they may enter. All of the pronominal roots
are monosyllabic morphemes (except for one allomorph of one of them, /yi ̀ʼè-/
‘4’; see below). None of them may occur on its own in discourse, but they are
among the few dependent morphemes to belong to the category of stressed
morphemes (see Section 2.2; note, however, that the pronominal roots are in
many cases optionally left unstressed). Being stressed morphemes, they always
1933. The nominal phrase
occur as the first syllable of independent words.
Section 3.3.1 introduces the general morphological organization of the smat
pronominal system and shows, in particular, that the pronominal roots exist under four major series of morphologically-conditioned allomorphs (labeled Allomorph 1 to Allomorph 4).
The next four sections successively present the types of morphological formations that involve each of these four series of allomorphs. Section 3.3.2 discusses
the morphological formations in which a pronominal root is immediately attached
with a bound noun (yielding a pronominally possessed bound noun) or a relational noun (independent pronoun in the syntactic function encoded by the corresponding relational noun; on the relational nouns, which are one of the two types of
morphemes—along with case-marking suffixes—that contribute encoding of syntactic functions, see Section 3.6.2). In these two cases, the Allomorph 1 series of the
pronominal roots is employed. Section 3.3.3 discusses the cases where a pronominal root is suffixed with /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’ (independent pronoun in the zero-case), /gǜ/ ‘refl’ (reflexive independent pronoun in the zero-case), or one of the “focal”
suffixes, which select for the Allomorph 2 series (on the notion of zero-case form
of nominal constituents, i.e. the default form of nominal constituents when they are
unmarked for syntactic function, see Section 3.6.1). Section 3.3.4 discusses the
cases where a pronominal root is suffixed with /-ʼǖ̃/ ‘acc’, /-ʼnà/ ‘dat’, and /-ʼü̋̃/
‘ben’ (independent pronoun in the accusative, dative, or benefactive respectively),
which select for the Allomorph 3 series. Finally, Section 3.3.5 discusses the case
where a pronominal root is suffixed with /-ʼrǖ ∼ -ʼri ̄/ ‘gen’ (independent pronoun
in the genitive), which is the only morpheme that selects for the Allomorph 4 series (on the accusative, dative, benefactive, and genitive case-marking suffixes, see
Section 3.6.2).
Finally, Section 3.3.6 focuses on specific semantic aspects of the language’s
pronominal system. It discusses, in particular, the semantics of the smat “fourth
person”, a value of the language’s paradigm of grammatical persons that may either
function as a first person plural inclusive, refer to a vaguely-defined social group
with which the speaker identifies, or represent a generic, non-referential human
participant.
Note that the morphology of the subject, (core) object, accusative, benefactive,
and partitive object pronominal indexes belonging to the inflectional morphology
of the predicative phrase are dealt with separately in Chapter 5. What is said of
the semantic organization of the smat pronominal system in the present section,
1943.3. Pronouns
however, equally applies to the pronominal roots and to the pronominal indexes.","[198, 199, 200]"
"4475. Inflection of the predicative phrase
the predicative phrase it is attached to.275
Importantly, the fact that only intransitive predicative phrases (‘sleep, speak,
jump, rest’) are used here to illustrate the inflectional morphology of predicative
phrases that do not comprise a third person masculine/neuter/non-salientive (core)
object index (i.e. [+3m/n/ns.obj] forms) should not be misunderstood. This convenient selection should not be erroneously taken to mean that only intransitive
predicative phrases can be inflected as [-3m/n/ns.obj] forms. Indeed, transitive
predicative phrases will be inflected just like intransitive predicative phrases any
time their object is not integrated within them as a third person masculine/neuter/
non-salientive object index. Thus, the intransitive predicative phrase /chā=pé/
‘I sleep’ (Chart A, column pcØ), for instance, is inflectionally distinct from the
transitive one /chā=nā=ngo̰/ ‘I eat it’ (Chart B, column pcØ), but it is no different from the transitive one /chóʼni ̋ chā=ngo̰/ ‘I eat fish’, where the object, a
NP in the non-salientive nominal class, is not indexed on the predicative phrase,
in this case because it is a syntactically independent NP that precedes the inflected
predicative phrase. Although intransitive predicative phrases may only inflect as
[-3m/n/ns.obj] forms by definition, transitive predicative phrases may, for
their part, inflect as both [-3m/n/ns.obj] and [+3m/n/ns.obj] forms depending on their morphosyntactic context.
A general gloss is provided for each chart in order to give a quick and rough
indication of the meaning of the forms it contains.","[452, 453]"
"3.5LinkerThe linker makes a specific part of speech of its own. It is a monosyllabic
proclitic that inflects for both nominal class and nominal tense. It is among
the morphemes that occur with the highest frequency in discourse.
The essential and most frequent function of the linker can be viewed as that
of introducing any NP that constitutes a syntactic expansion of a participant
already referred to within the clause, whether that participant was previously
referred to by means of a NP or by means of a pronominal index procliticized to
a finite predicative phrase. A straightforward illustration of the former case, i.e.
an instance of expansion of a participant previously referred to by means of
a NP, is given in example (223), where the noun nâi ‘tree’ is expanded by two
immediately subsequent relative clauses (each enclosed in square brackets). These
relative clauses, because they follow the first mention of the participant they are
elaborating on, must both be introduced by the linker (in its neuter inflectional
form specifically, given that the speaker is here assigning nâi ‘tree’ to the neuter
nominal class):
(223)̋ èwa̋
wíʼá nâi yà táʼüc̋ hi ̄nè yà wôchi ̋nèmáʼa nà-ūgünwíʼá nâi [yà=tá-ʼüc̋ hi ̄-nè][yà=wôchi ̋nè-máʼaindf tree lk.n/s=be.big-genuinely\sbjv-rel.n lk.n/s=ceiba.tree-comnà=ū-gü-̋ nè]-wa̋3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=say-pl\sbjv-rel.n-aloc‘to a huge tree they call ceiba tree’ [jgs 123–124]2503.5. Linker
Example (224) features a slightly less straightforward illustration of the same type
of expansion (the expansion is again enclosed in brackets). In this example, by
contrast with the order featured in (223), the more head-like NP (i ̀ kōri ̋gǘ ‘White
people’) follows—instead of preceding—the more dependent-like NP (tògǘ ‘others’).
(224)ngēmà tògǘ i ̀ kōri ̋gǘ
ngē-màtò-gǘ[i ̀=kōri ̋-gǘ]med.ns-anaph other.ns-pl lk.ns=White.person-pl‘the other White people’ [jgs 300]
Because the corresponding participant is first referred to by tògǘ, this word does
not bear the linker. The NP i ̀ kōri ̋gǘ ‘White people’, by contrast, since it refers to
a participant already mentioned within the clause by tògǘ, functions as an expansion and must consequently include the linker. In other words, of several NPs
corresponding to a single participant within a single clause, it is always the
non-first ones that bear the linker, regardless of whether these non-first NPs are
more head- or more dependent-like relative to the NP that represents the first mention of the participant within the clause. Note, thus, that the notion of expansion
as I define it here does not equal that of dependent or modifier. Note, additionally,
that certain modifiers, such as the indefinite determiner wi ́ʼá (as in (223)) and the
non-locative demonstratives (such as ngēmà in (224)), as well as genitive phrases
in general (i.e. NPs attached with the genitive case-marking suffix /-ãr̀ ǖ/), are directly preposed to the NP they modify, that is, they do not admit the presence
of the linker in front of that modified NP.223
Example (225) displays an occurrence of a NP (enclosed in brackets) functioning
as a syntactic expansion of a pronominal index. The NP yà tògūʼè ‘the other one’,
which makes it explicit whom the subject index /tá=/ ‘3s.sbj’ is referring to, must
include the linker, in this case in its salientive inflectional form (which in the speech
of many speakers happens to be homonymous with its neuter form):
(225)Mārǖ tá-yŭ yà tògūʼè.mārǖ tái =yŭ
prf[yà=tògūʼè]i3s.sbj=die lk.n/s=other.sWi ́ʼá ‘indf’ does in fact require the presence of the linker in front of the NP it modifies in the
speech of older speakers, and allows it, optionally, in the speech of younger speakers such as jgs
(who is the speaker who uttered example (224)).
2232513. The nominal phrase
‘The other one already died.’ [igs 448]
Note, importantly, that in this example the NP yà tògūʼè ‘the other one’ occurs
after the finite predicative phrase, which is why it is treated as an expansion of
the pronominal index. If it had been placed before the predicative phrase, it would
have represented itself the first mention of the referent within the clause and would
therefore not have been procliticized with the linker.
Besides its essentially syntactic function just discussed, the linker may additionally be said to fulfill an important semantic function, inasmuch as it is the locus
most frequently employed in discourse for the encoding of nominal tense,
which indirectly informs the tense value of the whole utterance.
The details of the syntactic distribution of the linker may prove relatively complex in practice, as is shown further below, but for the most part they result from
the general syntactic function just described. A particular circumstance that may
significantly contribute to obscure this syntactic distribution to the non-native analyst, however, is the existence in the language of a number of morphemes that
are homonymous with certain inflectional forms of the linker and may occur
in similar or identical positions as the linker in the speech flow. The three
morphemes with the highest potential for confusion are discussed in the following section. Importantly, however, these homonyms are either invariable or, for
those of them that can be inflected, they also feature inflectional forms that are not
homonymous with any of the forms of the linker. In most cases, these morphosyntactic properties allow to detect them with certainty in elicitation with adequate
transformation tests.
Section 3.5.1 exposes the morphological paradigm of the linker. Its syntactic
distribution is described and exemplified at length in Section 3.5.2.","[255, 256, 257]"
"2.8.1/ʨ/<*/ɕ/, /ʥ/<*/j/In today’s smat, the phoneme /ʥ/—usually pronounced [ʥ]—is occasionally
realized [j] by some older speakers, and /ʨ/—normally [ʨ]—may exceptionally
be realized [ɕ] by the oldest speakers (see Section 2.1.1). The written historical
records on Tikuna suggest that these realizations [j] and [ɕ] are conservative (as
opposed to their innovative variants [ʥ] and [ʨ]) and reflect the former regular
realizations of their corresponding phonemes.
The likely or explicit realizations of the reflexes of today’s smat /ʨ/ and /ʥ/
recorded in all the existing pre-linguistic records of Tikuna and in the major linguistic works on Tikuna are plotted in chronological order in Figures 19 and
20.164 The data in these figures lead me to hypothesize that a long-term process
Each name in Figures 19, 20, and 21 below is that of an individual who collected first-hand
data on a Tikuna variety. The names are placed at the approximate time of data collection (as opposed to the time of publication of the data; for more on the diagrammatic organization of these
figures, see Section 1.4). Below each name of individuals who produced linguistically-informed
records (i.e. after 1953) is a transcription in IPA of the phonetic realization reported or explicitly
described by the corresponding individual for a given phoneme. Below each name of individuals
who produced non-linguistically-informed records (i.e. before 1953) is an approximate transcription in IPA of the phonetic realization(s) that the corresponding individual likely witnessed for a
given phoneme. My interpretation of these realizations is based on the transcription habits of each
individual, taking into account the orthographic tradition of his native language at the time of data
collection as well as his transcription habits for other languages of which he has left written records.
As shown in Figure 19, for instance, the identifiable reflexes of today’s smat /ʨ/ occurring in
Tikuna words collected between 1817 and 1820 by the German biologist Johann Baptist Ritter von
Spix (1781–1826) and published in Martius (1867:159–161, 413–486) can be interpreted as *[ɕ]
or a coronal fricative phone close to it. In an overwhelming majority of cases, these reflexes are
indeed transcribed <s> (up to 37 occurrences) or <sch> (up to 12 occurrences). The grapheme
<s> in Spix’ use most likely stands for [s] (compare his transcriptions for a Quechuan variety he
witnessed in Peruvian Amazonia: <uâsy> ‘house’ most likely for [ˈwasi], <ghosa> ‘husband’ for

weakly articulated onset at the time of borrowing, and to have developed an initial
[ŋ] at a later stage. Note, however, that most loanwords of comparatively old date
(e.g. loanwords from Old Omagua) whose source form lacks an initial onset do not
display an initial [ŋ] in today’s smat, but a /ʔ/ (see, e.g., (117a), (119f), and (121b)
above). It remains unclear why some loans from onsetless sources yielded Tikuna
forms with an initial phone that would later develop into [ŋ], while others yielded
Tikuna forms with an initial /ʔ/.
The likely or explicit realizations of the reflexes of today’s smat [ŋ] recorded
in all the existing pre-linguistic records of Tikuna and in the major linguistic
works on Tikuna are plotted in chronological order in Figure 21.174 Note that in
this figure [ɦ ] stands for its International Phonetic Alphabet value or more broadly
for a weak voiced articulation close to it, or possibly even [Ø]. I interpret the data in
Figure 21 as supporting the [Ø]∼[ɦ ]>[ŋ] hypothesis. This evolution could have
taken place over the course of the first half of the 19th century.
The [Ø]∼[ɦ ]>[ŋ] hypothesis might explain why [ŋ] occurs in both nonnasal and nasal syllables in today’s smat, i.e. why its distribution does not
pattern like that of the other nasal consonant phones with regard to nasality, but
rather like that of /ʔ/ (see Section 2.3). This modern distribution would not appear problematic if all cases of [ŋ], whether in non-nasal or nasal syllable, arose
independently of nasality from [Ø] or a weak glottal articulation that, like /ʔ/,
would probably have been transparent to nasality.
In this [Ø]∼[ɦ ]>[ŋ] scenario, the rare and optional epenthesis of onset [ŋ]’s
in unstressed onsetless syllables in today’s smat (see end of Section 2.1.1) could
be interpreted as an optional overapplication in synchrony of the diachronic
process that allowed the initial boundary of stressed syllables with an onset

verb stem meaning ‘to return’ (sg. /ta̋-ègù/ ‘drop.sg-inv’, pl. /wò-ègù/ ‘drop.plinv’), for its part, can be considered to have, to a certain degree, non-compositional

This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between the

In (565–566), the same principle is shown to apply to the distribution of the allomorphs ta̰ and wò of the transitive verb meaning ‘to drop’. Note, however, that it
is now the number of the object argument (as opposed to the subject argument as
in the preceding two examples) that determines the use of the singular or plural
allomorph of the verb:

The fact that it is the number of the object argument, rather than that of the subject argument, that determines the selection of the singular or plural allomorph of
transitive verb roots inflecting for number is made even clearer by (567–568). In
(567), although the subject is explicitly marked as plural (by the presence of the
suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ within the predicative phrase), the singular allomorph gå of the
verb meaning ‘to lead’ is selected in accordance with the singular number of the
4915. Inflection of the predicative phrase
object argument. Conversely, in (568), although the subject is explicitly singular
(as indicated by /chà=/ ‘1sg.sbj\sbjv’), the plural allomorph nâ of the same verb
is selected in accordance with the plural number of the object argument.

(iv) Addition of /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’. The plural (or collective) value of the number
feature of the subject argument of certain verbal intransitive predicative phrases
is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through the addition
of the suffix /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ to these predicative phrases. It is unclear why certain
verbal intransitive predicative phrases may receive this suffix (e.g. pé ‘to sleep’,
tåʼu ‘to be absent’, or chi ́bǜ ‘to eat’), while others never do (e.g. ó ‘to disappear’,
déʼà ‘to speak’, or dău ‘to see’, the latter being an intransitive verb root that takes a
complement in the accusative), and still others display some inter-speaker variation
with respect to whether or not they may take this suffix (e.g. ngǜ ‘to rest’).
The verb pūrākǘ ‘to work’ belongs to the lexical class of predicative phrases that
regularly take /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ when their subject is plural (or collective). Contrast
example (569), where pūrākǘ is not suffixed with /-ē/ as its subject corresponds
referentially to a single man, with (570), where pūrākǘ is suffixed with /-ē/ as its
subject now corresponds to a group of men.

(v) Selection of figure-ground configuration suffix allomorph. The
singular vs plural (or collective) value of the number feature of the subject argument of most verbal intransitive predicative phrases that contain any of the
derivational suffixes encoding the figure-ground configurations ‘in’, ‘out’, and ‘off’,
and that of the object argument of most verbal transitive predicative phrases that
contain these same suffixes, is regularly—although not entirely systematically—
encoded through the selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of
these suffixes (e.g. /-ku̽chi ́/ ‘in.sg’ vs /-ku̽/ ‘in.pl’). On these suffixes, see Sections 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.2, and 4.2.3.5.
This strategy for number encoding is illustrated by the contrast between examples (571) and (572) (the latter being repeated from (455b) above). These largely
parallel examples differ in the selection of the form of the figure-ground configuration suffix featured in their essentially synonymous main predicative phrases. In
(571), the singular allomorph /-ē/ of the figure-ground configuration suffix meaning ‘off’ is selected for, while it is its plural allomorph /-ǜ̃/ that is used in (572). Because the predicative phrases in question are transitive, the selection of /-ē/ ‘off.sg’
in (571) indicates that the object argument is singular (in this case, a mash), while
the selection of /-ǜ̃/ ‘off.pl’ in (572) indicates that the object argument is plural (in
this case, plantains).

Note, however, than in a few lexicalized predicative phrases, the plural allomorph of a figure-ground configuration suffix is used in practice with a singular value, as in the singular intransitive predicative phrases /ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sgin.pl) ‘to enter (sg.)’ and /ṹ-ʼǜ̃/ (go.sg-out.pl) ‘to exit (sg.)’, in particular.
(vi) Distributive suffix allomorph selection.
The non-plural (i.e. singular or collective) vs plural value of the number feature of the subject, object, or
accusative argument of predicative phrases that contain the derivational distributive suffix is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through the
selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of this suffix (specifically
/-chi ̀gǜ/ ‘distr.sg’ vs /-ètānǜ/ ‘distr.pl’). In a clause that contains several arguments that could be specified by the plural form of the distributive suffix (e.g. both
the subject and object arguments of a transitive predicative phrase), which of them
is being specified by it as plural is left to context.
This strategy for number encoding in illustrated by the contrast between examples (573) and (574). These examples both feature a predicative phrase that
includes the plural form of the intransitive verb meaning ‘to go’ (i ̃̂). These predicative phrases necessarily have a non-singular (i.e. collective or plural) subject. The
one in (573) is suffixed with the non-plural form of the distributive suffix (/-chi ̀gǜ/),
which indicates that its subject (in this case, the jungle fauna) is to be viewed as a
collective entity rather than as a collection of individuals. In such a context, distributivity is accordingly interpreted as indicating that the process occurs little by
little or step by step.

[ano2 7:29–7:34]
By contrast, the predicative phrase containing i ̃̂ ‘to go (pl.)’ in (574) is suffixed with
the plural form of the distributive suffix (/-ètānǜ/), which indicates that its subject
(in this case, students) is to be viewed as a collection of individuals rather than as
a collective entity. In such a context, distributivity is accordingly interpreted as
indicating that each of these individuals is involved in a specific sub-occurrence of
the process (in this case, each individual student comes from a community that is
different from that of all or part of the other students).

[jgs 713–716]
(vii) Addition of /-gǘ/ ‘pl’. Finally, the plural value of the number feature of
either the subject, object, or accusative argument of apparently any predicative
phrase may be optionally made explicit by the addition of the suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ to
that predicative phrase. In a clause that contains several arguments that could be
specified by /-gǘ/ ‘pl’ (e.g. both the subject and object arguments of a transitive
4955. Inflection of the predicative phrase
predicative phrase), which of them is being specified by it as plural is left to
context. Note that this suffix, by contrast with /-ē/ ‘intr.pl’ (see paragraph (iv)
above), is transcategorial, i.e. it may be attached to words belonging to several
parts of speech, including nominal constituents and predicative phrases.
Examples (575) and (576) both feature the verb déʼà occurring with a third person non-salientive subject. The number of the subject argument of déʼà in (575)
is left unspecified (in this case, the subject—a single man—is contextually singular). In (576), by contrast, déʼà bears the suffix /-gǘ/ ‘pl’, which in this case may
only indicate that its subject is plural since no other potentially plural argument is
present in the clause.

Although in this section I treat on the same level the seven identified strategies
for specifying the number feature of arguments within a predicative phrase, note
that not all of them can be equally said to be inflectional in nature. The encoding of number through index selection (see paragraph (i)) and predicative class
reassignment (see paragraph (ii)) may only operate in finite predicative phrases as it
4965.10. Strategies for participants number encoding
relies on strictly inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase. The remaining
five strategies (see paragraphs (iii–vii)), by contrast, rely on morphology that can
be considered as derivational in nature inasmuch as it may occur in non-finite
predicative phrases. For instance, the use of the plural allomorph of a verb root inflecting for number (strategy discussed in paragraph (iii)) and that of the suffix /-ē/
‘intr.pl’ (strategy discussed in paragraph (iv)) in zero-derived nominalizations are
illustrated in examples (577) and (578) respectively.

Note, however, that in spontaneous speech the plural (or collective) marking
morphological devices employed by these remaining five strategies rarely occur in
non-finite predicative phrases. In such contexts, their singular counterparts may
be generalized with, in practice, no indication of singular number implied.
Thus, in example (579), the singular allomorph of the verb meaning ‘to kill’ (ma̰)
is used in a non-finite nominalization while its “object” argument, which is syntactically treated as a genitive complement (/dùa-̰̃ ãr̀ ǖ/ ‘human-gen’), is referentially
plural (the noun dùã̰ ‘human’ virtually always has a plural referent, which the context indicates is also the case in this example).

Note, also, that the five strategies discussed in paragraphs (iii–vii), although
their application does not systematically correlate with the number features of arguments, are applied consistently in a majority of cases in spontaneous speech
(the strategy of predicative class reassignment described in (ii), in comparison, is
only resorted to occasionally).
For these reasons, while one cannot talk of a grammatical system of agreement
for number beyond the encoding of first and second person participants in smat (in
the way that one can talk of an elaborate smat grammatical system of agreement
for nominal class, in particular), number in the language may still be considered
to a certain extent as an inflectional category, even outside of first and second
person participants.","[495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503]"
"5.7.1Indexes for benefactive-malefactive and
accusative participants (slots 1–2)The benefactive(-malefactive) and accusative indexes in slots 1 and 2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase (see Table 39, p.393) stand pronominally for participants which, if they were expressed as full NPs, would bear
the benefactive and accusative case-marking suffixes /-(ã)̀ ʼü̃̋/ and /-ʼü̃̄/, respectively. Compare, for instance, example (506), where the participant referring
to the recipient of a payment, being expressed as a NP, receives the benefactive
suffix /-ʼü̃̋/ (/maestro-ʼü̃̋/ [expert-ben] ‘to a professional’), with (507), where the
recipient participant is encoded as a mere pronominal index procliticized to the
predicative phrase (/cha̋=/ ‘1sg.ben’):

Restoring an independent pronoun instead of a benefactive or accusative index
may occur as a strategy allowing for the insertion of an enclitic (especially
one that typically behaves as a second-position clitic) between the pronoun and
the predicative phrase. In the following example, the future enclitic /=tá/, which
usually behaves as a second-position clitic, is inserted right after the expression of a
second person singular accusative participant by means of an independent pronoun
(/kû-ʼü̃̄/ ‘2sg-acc’), and in front of the predicative phrase:
(509)̆ güʼ̋ ü!”

However, the restoration of an independent pronoun is not obligatory for enclitic insertion, and in practice remains infrequent (although it might have been
obligatory at a former stage of the language when independent pronouns in the
benefactive and the accusative were just starting to evolve into proclitics). Contrast example (509) above, where /=tá/ ‘fut’ intervenes between the expression
of the accusative participant and the predicative phrase, with the following example, where the same enclitic comes after the whole predicative phrase regardless of
the fact that the latter bears an accusative index (/nǖ=/ ‘3m/n/ns.acc’):

Using an independent pronoun in the accusative instead of an accusative index
seems to be obligatory in a single context, specifically when the corresponding
participant is a complement of the deictic verb. This morphologically irregular
verb is never procliticized with the accusative indexes (see Section 6.2.1). Thus,
the third person salientive independent pronoun in the accusative (/tü̂-ʼü̃̄/ ‘3s-acc’)
in the following example cannot be replaced by its corresponding index (a form
such as */tǖ=ñâ-ʼü̃́/ [3s.acc=do.thus.3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv-sub] for ‘he told him’ is
unattested in my data and in all likelihood ungrammatical):

him: [...]’ [jsg 134–135]
In cases where both a benefactive participant and an accusative participant
are to be referred to pronominally within the same clause, only the accusative
one may be encoded as an index procliticized to the predicative phrase. The benefactive one is then obligatorily expressed as an independent pronoun (for instances
of this situation, see examples (153), (T69), and (T70)). In other words, slots 1 and
2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase cannot be filled simultaneously. I treat them as separate slots, instead of considering that they belong to
a single paradigm of which only one element can be present within a given inflected
predicative phrase, because the benefactive and accusative series of indexes are not
interchangeable in the situation just discussed. That is, when both a benefactive
and an accusative participants are referred to pronominally within a single clause,
it is not possible to express first the accusative one as an independent pronoun and
next the benefactive one as an index. Benefactive and accusative pronominal markers have to occur in this order, with the consequence that only the benefactive one,
being more peripheral than the accusative one relative to the predicative phrase,
can be “expelled” out of the inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase when
needed.
The first person singular benefactive and accusative indexes display two interspeaker variants each, specifically /cha̋=∼chő=/ (ben) and /chā=∼chō=/
(acc). The /a/-variants /cha̋=/ and /chā=/ are logically (given the origin of the
benefactive and accusative indexes as phonological reductions of the independent
4575. Inflection of the predicative phrase
pronouns in the benefactive and the accusative) used by those speakers who use the
/a/-variant of the first person singular pronominal root in cases where it bears the
benefactive or accusative suffixes (/châ-ʼü̋̃/ ‘1sg-ben’, /châ-ʼǖ̃/ ‘1sg-acc’). Conversely, the /o/-variants /chő=/ and /chō=/ are used by those speakers who use
the /o/-variant of the first person singular pronominal root in combination with the
benefactive or accusative suffixes (/chô-ʼü̋̃/ ‘1sg-ben’, /chô-ʼǖ̃/ ‘1sg-acc’). On the
/a/ and /o/ variants of the first person singular pronominal root in combination
with the benefactive and accusative suffixes, see Section 3.3.4.
Note that morphological sequences involving an accusative index followed by
the areal locative index /i ̋=/ (on which see next section) are occasionally realized by some speakers exactly like the benefactive index in the corresponding
person, which can prove confusing to the analyst. Thus, the morphemes /kű=/
and /tü̋=/, in examples (512) and (513) respectively, do not encode a second person singular benefactive and a third person salientive benefactive participants (although they are homonymous with the corresponding benefactive indexes /kű=/
‘2sg.ben’ and /tü̋=/ ‘3s.ben’), but the sequence of a second person singular accusative and a third person salientive accusative participants followed by the areal
locative index /i ̋=/:

4585.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types5.7.2Third person indexes for locative and
partitive object participants (slot 3)Third person participants with a locative syntactic function may be indexed
on the predicative phrase by means of the proclitics /i ̋=/ (areal locative participant), /ne̋=/nű=/ (areal locative participant corresponding to the source of a
centripetal motion), and /i ̀=/ (punctual locative participant?) in slot 3 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase. These morphemes are discussed in
Section 5.7.2.1.
The encoding of third person (core) object participants that are only partitively affected by the process denoted by a transitive predicative phrase involve,
under certain conditions, the use of the proclitics /tà=/ (masculine partitive object), /ne̋=(/nű=?)/ (neuter partitive object), and /nè=/ (non-salientive partitive
object) in what I hypothesize to be the same morphosyntactic slot. These morphemes are the topic of Section 5.7.2.2.
The reasons why I tentatively analyze these two subsystems of locative participant indexation and partitive object participant indexation as belonging to the same
morphosyntactic slot are because 1) they never co-occur within the same inflected
predicative phrase in my data (negative evidence) and 2) they appear to share
one morpheme, specifically /ne̋=/ (and possibly its subdialectal variant /nű=/),
which is featured in both subsystems although with different functions (positive
but uncertain evidence). This question could probably be easily settled by further
research.","[459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"

Glossary of lexemes
This glossary lists in alphabetical order all the more lexical-like smat morphemes
mentioned in this work together with their variants. Each entry provides the morpheme class of the corresponding lexeme as well as the gloss (or glosses) that it
receives in this work, and occasionally a short comment. Bound morphemes whose
first syllable features a toneme /4 /, /3 /, or /C / are further characterized as being
either triggers ([+tr.]) or non-triggers ([-tr.]) of the Pattern 2 tonological alternations (see Section 2.6.2.2). Lexemes that refer to particular living species are
additionally provided—on an indicative basis—with the binomial name of that (or
occasionally those) species (the mention “unidentified” appears in cases where I am
unable to provide a binomial identification).349 Note the following abbreviations:

The general syntactic rules stated above do not always apply, however. Causee
arguments in causative constructions based on initially intransitive predicative
phrases may be treated as oblique arguments in the accusative—instead of
core objects, as expected—when specific syntactic and semantic conditions are met,
namely 1) when such causee arguments are represented by a full NP preceding
the predicative phrase and 2) when the corresponding referent is animate. This is
shown in example (427). This additional rule, while optional in most cases, seems
to be obligatory, at least for certain speakers, in the specific case where the causee
argument belongs to the salientive nominal class: contrast the ungrammatical sentence in example (428a) to its corrected form—with the salientive causee argument
in the accusative—in example (428b).

‘I cause the child to eat.’ [jsg elic.]
Occurrences of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ in my corpus are rather frequent on initially intransitive predicative phrases, while they are rare on initially transitive predicative phrases. In the latter cases, a causee referent is always morphosyntactically
present, whether as a syntactically explicit NP or as an index procliticized to the
predicative phrase. My data do not allow me to tell whether the causee referent
(which is in this case an oblique complement in the accusative) may be left out from
a causative construction derived from an initially transitive predicative phrase.
The suffix /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ does not alter the predicative class of the predicative
phrases it attaches to. The causative constructions featured in examples (423–
428) above are all based on predicative phrases that initially belong to pcØ and
thus all display derived predicative phrases inflecting in pcØ. The causative constructions in (429) and (430) are based on predicative phrases that initially belong
to pcrǖ and pci ̀, respectively, and therefore display derived predicative phrases
inflecting in these same predicative classes.

The ordering of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ relative to other non-inflectional morphological
components of the predicative phrase seems to generally entail scope effects, with
morphemes preceding /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ usually falling under its scope and morphemes following /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ usually extending their scope over it. This hypothesis requires further
3754. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
research, however, as in many cases such scope effects cannot be easily tested. On
the other hand, the scope relationship between /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ and the feature of associated motion—an inflectional feature in smat, only available in finite forms of
predicative phrases (see Section 5.8)—is grammatically unspecified and its interpretation relies on context. In other words, whether a predicative phrase simultaneously featuring /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ and associated motion is to be interpreted as meaning
‘[cause to [go/come and ...]]’ (involving motion of the causee) or ‘[go/come
and [cause to ...]]’ (involving motion of the causer) is context-dependent.
The following example may thus be interpreted as involving motion of either the
causee or the causer, or even motion of both participants:
(431)Chāyà-péʼẽʼ́ e.chā=yà=pé-ʼẽʼ́ e1sg.sbj=am.3m/n/ns.obj=sleep-caus‘I cause him to go and sleep [e.g. I tell my son to go to bed without moving

baby to sleep.].’
‘I go with him and cause him to sleep [e.g. I walk my drunk husband back
home after a party and put him to bed.].’ [jsg elic.]
My data do not allow me to tell whether the stacking of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’, i.e. the
suffixation of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ to a predicative phrase that already contains an occurrence
of it, is grammatical. Interestingly, however, the antipassivization of a causative
construction in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ by suffixing it with /-tàe/̄ ‘antip3’ is attested, as shown in
the following example:

3764.5. Valency operations
The semantics of causative constructions derived with /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ cover a
very wide array of causation situations.255 Depending on the context, causative
constructions in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ may thus be varyingly translated in English as e.g. ‘cause to
do’ or ‘induce to be’, ‘make do, order to do, force to do’ or ‘allow to do, let do, put
in conditions to do’, etc. In particular, the occurrence of /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ is not restricted
to predicative phrases with specific semantic characteristics (e.g. only stative
or only dynamic predicative phrases). Its occurrence does not specify—or is not
constrained by—whether the causee is animate or inanimate (contrast (427) and
(429) respectively), whether it has or does not have control (contrast (426) and
(433)), or whether it is willing or unwilling (contrast (434) and (430)).

As for the causer argument, it may be acting both directly or indirectly (contrast
(427) and (426)). A spontaneous example such as (435), where the causer and
the causee (a reflexive pronoun) are coreferential, as well as the third translation

2553774. Non-inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase
option for the elicited utterance in example (431), suggest that the causer may be
itself physically involved in the process carried out by the causee, although in most
cases it is not. My data do not, however, allow me to tell whether the causer may
be inanimate (as opposed to animate, which it always is in my data) or whether the
causer’s action may be accidental (as opposed to intentional, which it always is in
may data).

B93]
In one example in my corpus, a causative construction with coreferential causer
and causee arguments (with the latter represented by a reflexive pronoun) is used
to express that the process is artificially simulated (with lit. ‘to cause oneself
to ...’ conveying the meaning of ‘to pretend to ...’). The jaguar who killed the
mythical hero Ngutapa pretends he cannot speak at the moment so as to elude
questions by Ngutapa’s sons:

toothache [...].’ [lar C502]
The /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of the verb root ngǜ ‘rest’—/ngǜ-ʼẽʼ́ e,/ lit. ‘to cause
someone to rest’—has the lexicalized meaning ‘to help (someone)’. The synchronically unanalyzable verb stem g̃ʼŭʼẽʼ́ e ‘to wait for someone’ was most likely historically derived as the /-ʼẽʼ́ e/-causative form of a former verb root *g̃ʼŭ no longer
existing in today’s smat.

3784.5. Valency operations4.5.3Valency operations with no dedicated4.5.3.1Passive constructionexponenceIn smat, the more patient-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically
represented as a core object in the transitive construction) may by no means be
omitted from an utterance without the simultaneous addition of dedicated derivational morphology to the predicative phrase (on the antipassive suffixes /-ètà/, /-ē/
and /-tàe/̄ , which allow such an omission, see Section 4.5.1). By contrast, the more
agent-like argument of a transitive predicate (syntactically represented as a subject
in the transitive construction) may be omitted from an utterance without the addition of any specific derivational morphology to the predicative phrase. When this
occurs, the predicate merely becomes intransitive and the more patient-like
argument is promoted to the syntactic function of subject, i.e. the only core
argument position left in the resulting utterance. I call “passive construction” this
intransitive use of typically transitive predicative phrases with no derivational morphology involved. Contrast the ordinary transitive construction in example (437a),
where both agent and patient referents are overtly mentioned, with the passive
construction in (437b), where only the patient referent is retained:

Examples (438a) and (438b) illustrate the exact same contrast in spontaneous textual examples:

Examples (439) and (440) feature both a passive construction and an ordinary transitive construction involving the same verb, specifically the verb root wü̏ ‘to scratch,

The passive construction in smat does not seem to allow for the overt expression of an agent participant (e.g. as an oblique equivalent to English ‘by ...’).
The passive construction does not affect the predicative class of the predicative phrase it is applied to. In examples (438a) and (438b) above, for instance,
the predicative phrase /g̃ü̊-ègù/ (slant?-inv) ‘to flip over’ is inflected in the predicative class pcØ in both its ordinary transitive and its passive uses. Similarly, in
the following example, /då-yé/ (chop-in.the.middle) ‘to cut in halves’ is inflected in
pci ̄ in a passive construction, in the same way as when it occurs in a transitive construction256 (compare also the two occurrences of the verb root yĕ ‘to chop down’
in (440), which both feature pci ̄ inflection):

Although the passive construction gets a stative-resultative reading in most
of its uses, this Aktionsart feature is only implied as a tendency rather than being
intrinsic to that construction. The following example displays a case of passive
construction with a telic reading, which is evidenced by the presence of an adjunct
providing a punctual temporal reference for the event referred to:257

intransitively and transitively derives from a specific lexical property of that predicative phrase, namely its lability, and 2) that there is no directionality of any kind
between the intransitive uses and the transitive uses of such predicative phrases,
which tend to indiscriminately occur in both intransitive and transitive constructions. However, although the passive construction is in practice relatively rare in
discourse, it seems that at least a vast majority of transitive predicative phrases may
be submitted to it. Its high productivity inclines me to treat it as a morphosyntactic construction typically available to any transitive predicative phrase, rather than
as an alternative use of particular predicative phrases allowed by specific properties
of the latter. On the other hand, predicative phrases that may occur in the passive construction are in practice used transitively in the vast majority of their
occurrences in discourse. This significant differential in frequency between transitive (frequent) and passive (rare) uses of these predicative phrases suggests some
sort of directionality between the two uses, with transitive uses being more primary and passive uses being more secondary. This is why I have opted for treating
the passive construction as a morphosyntactic operation that derives intransitive
constructions from predicative phrases that are intrinsically transitive.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388]"

487This chapter describes the inflectional morphology of the finite predicative
phrase. Nearly all of the morphemes under study here are proclitics that immediately precede the predicative phrase. The only exception to this generalization is a suffix that is immediately attached to the right edge of the predicative
phrase. The function of many of these morphemes is to index participants with
various syntactic functions: subjects, objects, accusative participants (which are
morphosyntactically and, to a certain extent, semantically distinct from (core) objects), benefactive(-malefactive) participants, locative participants, and partitive
object participants. Other morphemes are markers of the predicative class (or
“conjugation class”, so to say) of the predicative phrase they precede. Still others encode that the predicative phrase features associated motion. A number of
these morphemes are portmanteau morphemes that realize several of these functions simultaneously. These contribute to make the predominantly agglutinative
morphology of smat fusional to a certain extent. Finally, one specific inflectional
value (the Subjunctive Inflectional Type) involves tonological alternations among
its phonological exponents and thus constitutes a case of partially suprasegmental
morphology.
Crucially, note that the inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase does
not directly encode any notions of tense, aspect, mood, or evidentiality (to
the exception—arguably—of the progressive aspect, on which see Section 5.7.2.1,
p.462). Such notions are mostly encoded by means of derivational suffixes of the
predicative phrase (see Section 4.4), clause-level enclitics and particles, or, in the
388case of tense specifically, within nominal constituents via the inflection of certain
word classes for nominal tense.
The following two examples illustrate part of these introductory observations about the formal and functional properties of the inflectional morphology of
the predicative phrase in smat:

Example (446) displays a predicative phrase inflected in the Indicative Inflectional
Type. The Indicative Inflectional Type can be considered, from a morphological
perspective, as the unmarked Inflectional Type (by contrast with the other two Inflectional Types of the language, specifically the Subjunctive Inflectional Type and,
to a certain extent, the Imperative Inflectional Type). That is why this feature is not
included in the example’s gloss. The inflectional proclitics in this example, whose
sequence represents a typical case of agglutinative morphology, successively index
a participant in the accusative (/tǖ=/ ‘3s.acc’) and a subject participant (/ná=/
‘3m/n/ns.sbj’), and encode the predicative class (or “conjugation class”) of the
predicative phrase (/rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’). This predicative class is in this case inherited by
the predicative phrase /chó-ʼẽʼ́ e/ (be.there.pl-caus) ‘to cause to be somewhere (pl.)’
from the lexical predicative class of the verb root chó ‘be there (pl.)’ from which it
is derived. Example (447) displays a predicative phrase inflected in the Subjunctive
Inflectional Type. This manifests itself suprasegmentally on one of the inflectional
proclitics (in this case, the third person subject index /nà=/ ‘3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv’,
whose toneme /1 / can be interpreted as an exponent of the Subjunctive Inflectional
Type) as well as—in principle—on the last syllable of the predicative phrase itself
(in this case, the third person object index /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’, i.e. the unique inflectional suffix of the predicative phrase, which happens not to shift toneme under
the effect of the morphotonological alternations that regularly affect the last syllable
of predicative phrases in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, hence the parentheses
3895. Inflection of the predicative phrase
in its gloss ‘3m/n/ns.obj(\sbjv)’). Note, importantly, that in glosses features with
an exclusively suprasegmental exponent are preceded by a backslash <\>. Finally,
the inflectional proclitic /yà=/ ‘am’ in (447) indicates that the main process (‘he
plucked it’) is preceded by an associated motion event (‘he went and plucked it’).
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.1 gives a general overview
of the entire inflectional template of the finite predicative phrase and of the
various morphosyntactic categories that its 8 morphological slots allow to encode.
Section 5.2 introduces, from both a formal perspective and a functional perspective, the major distinction that obtains between what I label the three Inflectional
Types (or “moods”, as a very first approximation) of the language, specifically
the Indicative Inflectional Type (ind), the Imperative Inflectional Type (imp), and
the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (sbjv). Although the morphology of all three
Inflectional Types roughly operates within the same inflectional template, their
specific paradigms differ within slots 4 to 8 of that template. Sections 5.3, 5.4,
and 5.5 successively describe the specific inflectional morphology of ind, imp,
and sbjv occurring in these slots. Section 5.6 displays a series of inflectional
charts that summarize the detailed descriptions given in Sections 5.3–5.5. Section 5.7 proceeds to describe the inflectional morphology that occurs in slots 1
to 3 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase, which remains identical across the three Inflectional Types. Sections 5.3 through 5.7 thus provide a
complete description (slots 1 through 8)—but to a large extent a formal one—of
the morphological material that contributes the encoding of inflectional features of
the predicative phrase in smat. Sections 5.8 and 5.9 respectively focus, from a
chiefly functional perspective, on two of the grammatical categories that are encoded by this morphological material, specifically associated motion (encoded in
slot 5) and predicative class (encoded in slot 6). Finally, Section 5.10 discusses
the various morphological strategies available in the language for the encoding of
the number feature of participants within the predicative phrase itself, whether
these strategies involve strictly inflectional morphological material from slots 1–8
or other morphological material.","[393, 394, 395]"

This index lists in alphabetical order all the more grammatical-like smat morphemes mentioned in this work together with all their allomorphs and lectal variants, if any. The numbers under each entry are references to all the pages where the
corresponding morpheme is mentioned, whether within a grammatical discussion
in the main text, within an elicited or extrapolated numbered example, within a
spontaneous numbered example, or within the spontaneous interlinearized text in
Appendix A.
This index is intended to serve three main purposes:
– provide a general list of the morphemes of the language;
– allow readers to easily use this grammatical description as a corpus of
textual data for the study of these morphemes (and, in particular, for the
study of those morphemes that are not explicitly described in this work);
– and give a rough indication of the frequency of these morphemes in my
elicited and spontaneous data (beware, however, that the number of page
references under a given entry does not directly reflect the number of textual occurrences of the corresponding morpheme in this work, as these page
references also include main-text discussions of the morphemes as well as a
handful of occurrences of the morphemes in extrapolated examples).

515The manner deictic verb284 /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/, which I broadly gloss as ‘do
thus’, is one of the most frequent verbs of the language in discourse, particularly
in narratives. It deserves special attention from both a functional and a formal
perspective. The differences that set it apart from any other kind of predicative phrases in the language, and from regular verb roots in particular, are indeed
equally remarkable from these two perspectives.
Note in particular its unique bipartite morphological nature (hence its bipartite labeling as /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/). In most—although not all—of its inflectional
forms, the deictic verb displays double exponence. In these forms, a first morpheme
/ña̋-/ñâ-/ and a second morpheme /-gǜ/-rǖgǜ/, which together fulfill a single unanalyzable function, are separated by a subject person index (e.g. /ña̋-chā-rǖgǜ/
[‘do.thus-1sg.sbj-do.thus’] ‘I do thus’; the morphological distribution of the alloOr ‘manner demonstrative verb’, following the terminology put forward in Guérin (2015)’s

to subject index and Inflectional Type).
The deictic verb’s semantic and syntactic peculiarities are discussed in Section 6.1, its unique inflectional morphology in Section 6.2, and its limited derivational morphology in Section 6.3.","[504, 505]"
"5.9Predicative class assignment (slot 6)This section discusses the fairly complex lexical, semantic, and morphosyntactic bases for the assignment of predicative phrases to one of the five predicative classes of the language, specifically the unmarked predicative class (pcØ)
and the predicative classes in /i ̄=/ (pci ̄), in /i ̀=/ (pci ̀), in /rǖ=/ (pcrǖ), and in
/nà=/ (pcnà). For a detailed description of the morphological encoding of the
predicative classes, see Sections 5.3–5.5, as well as the charts at the end of Section 5.6. Their respective labels are derived from what can be shown to be their
basic morphological exponent, i.e. their only exponent that does not simultaneously
encode features unrelated to predicative class (portmanteau morpheme) but only
encodes predicative class in a straightforward manner. These basic morphological
exponents can be directly observed, in particular, in cases where the subject of a
predicative phrase inflected in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type is a syntactic NP
(as opposed to a pronominal index) that precedes that predicative phrase (see row
“Explicit NP” at bottom of Chart J, p.452).
The smat predicative classes are, as a first approximation, comparable to the
categories commonly referred to as “conjugations” or “verb groups” in the traditional grammar of the Romance languages (see the four conjugations of Classical
Latin or the three verb groups of French). They are ultimately a lexical feature
of each predicative phrase (and, among them, of verbs) that is exposed morphologically through the selection of a specific inflectional paradigm. As a
consequence, learners of the language essentially have to memorize the predicative
class of each predicative phrase as they first encounter it. Contrast, for instance,
the pairs of semantically comparable verbs in the following examples:
(549)

chā=pé1sg.sbj=sleep‘I slept’1sg.sbj=pci ̀.3m/n/ns.obj=kill.sg1sg.sbj=pcrǖ=rest‘I rested’Recall, importantly, that I do not normally include explicitly the grammatical feature pcØ in glosses (hence its absence in the glosses of the left-side forms in (549)),
as I analyze it as the default predicative class of the language. There is no obvious
morphosyntactic or semantic reason why a verb meaning ‘to eat’ should be lexically assigned to pcØ while one meaning ‘to drink’ is assigned to pci ̄ (as shown in
example (549a)), or why a verb meaning ‘to sleep’ should be lexically assigned to
pcØ while one meaning ‘to rest’ is assigned to pcrǖ (as shown in (549c)). It seems
even more arbitrary and unpredictable that the two suppletive forms of the verb
meaning ‘to kill’, one of them taking a singular object and the other one taking a
plural object, should be lexically assigned to two different predicative classes (pci ̀
for the former, pcØ for the latter, as shown in (549b)).
Certain verb morphemes may enter the formation of several lexicalized predicative phrases with different syntactic and semantic role structures and obviously
related but different meanings (contrast, for instance, /âirű-ʼü̃̄ chā=dău/ (dog-acc
1sg.sbj=see) ‘I see the dog’ vs /âirű-ka̰ chā=dău/ (dog-cause 1sg.sbj=see) ‘I
look for the dog’, where the same verb dău governs different types of complements
and takes on slightly different meanings). Often, such pairs (or larger sets) of predicative phrases based on the same verb morpheme are additionally assigned
lexically to different predicative classes. There is no apparent motivation, however, for these differences in predicative class assignment, and for why the members
of such pairs of predicative phrases are respectively assigned to this or that specific
predicative class. Contrast, for instance, the pairs of predicative phrases in the
following examples:

̃̄ ̄John-ploc 1sg.sbj=pcrǖ=think‘I thought about John’However, the fact that the lexical assignment of predicative phrases to predicative classes is to be analyzed as ultimately arbitrary and unpredictable on morphosyntactic or semantic grounds does not mean that no regularities at all may
be detected in that assignment.
pcØ is clearly the default predicative class, from a morphological point of
view (what characterizes its inflectional paradigm is in many cases the absence of
morpheme in the slot where the inflectional paradigms of the other predicative
classes display a specific predicative class marker) as well as from the point of view
of the lexical distribution of predicative phrases in predicative classes. Predicative
classes with all sorts of meanings and morphosyntactic properties (whether verbal or non-verbal and intransitive or transitive, in particular) are lexically assigned
to pcØ, which likely makes it the most frequent predicative class both in the
language’s lexicon and in discourse. Spanish morphemes that are borrowed or inserted by code-mixing and used predicatively in smat (e.g. gánà ‘win’, from Sp.
gana ‘she/he wins’; sérò ‘be absent’, from Sp. cero ‘zero’; Sp. importante ‘important’,
used in smat as a verb meaning ‘be important’), are systematically assigned to pcØ,
which manifests its nature of open class.
pci ̄ is the second-largest predicative class in terms of the number of predicative phrases that are lexically assigned to it, but note that it is a closed lexical
class, by contrast with pcØ, and one with a relatively reduced number of members
compared with pcØ. All predicative phrases lexically belonging to pcØ seem to be
verbal. They may be either intransitive or transitive, and do not appear to feature clear defining semantic properties (e.g. dür̊ á ‘be unkind (intr.)’, déʼà ‘to speak
(intr.)’, â ‘to burn oneself (intr.)’, yâʼu ‘to seize (tr.)’, gû ‘to roast (tr.)’).
Few predicative phrases are lexically assigned to pcrǖ (about 20–25 different
pcrǖ predicative phrases are attested in my corpus). All of them are verbal, and
4805.9. Predicative class assignment (slot 6)
more specifically consist in or are derived from intransitive verbs. Most of them
denote processes affecting the referent corresponding to the subject but on which
̆ ā ‘to forget’,
the latter has no control or a limited control (e.g. chàu ‘be bored’, g̃üm
yù ‘to wake up’, ngǜ ‘to rest’, châ ‘to swell’, ó ‘to disappear’). But note, on the one
hand, that not all predicative phrases denoting such processes are lexically assigned
to pcrǖ (e.g. múü̃̀ ‘be afraid’ belongs lexically to pcØ and dʼăwè ‘be sick’ to pci ̄),
and, on the other hand, that a few lexical pcrǖ verbs do involve full control of the
subject (e.g. mōʼè ‘to say hello or goodbye’).
Predicative phrases assigned to pci ̀ and pcnà are, in practice, not easily detectable for phonological and morphological reasons. In particular, the inflectional
forms corresponding to these two predicative classes are in many cases identical or
extremely similar to those of the much more frequent predicative classes pci ̄ and
pcØ, respectively. What is clear, in any case, is that pci ̀ and pcnà are very limited classes in terms of the number of predicative phrases that are lexically
assigned to them. They are likely to be, in addition, obsolescent classes in the
process of merging into other predicative classes.
About 5–10 different predicative phrases that can be relatively confidently analyzed as lexically attributed to pci ̀ are attested in my corpus. All of them are
verbal. They display widely diverging meanings and may be either intransitive
or transitive, which suggests that they do not feature any defining semantic or
morphosyntactic properties (e.g. kà ‘to shout (intr.)’, nâi ‘to fart (intr.)’, dău ‘to
bother (intr., with the bothered argument marked with the relational noun /-gu̽/
‘ploc’)’, ma̰ ‘to kill (sg.; tr.)’). The copula verb i ̃̊ ‘to be’ is by far the pci ̀ predicative
phrase with the highest frequency in discourse. It is probable that the distinction
between the inflectional paradigms of pci ̄ and pci ̀ is gradually getting blurred
in today’s smat, with the result that pci ̀ predicative phrases (with the exception
of i ̃̊ ‘to be’) may optionally be inflected like pci ̄ predicative phrases without any
detectable consequence, especially in the speech of younger speakers.
Only two verbal predicative phrases that can be confidently analyzed as belonging lexically to pcnà are attested in my corpus: pù ‘to rob’ and dēyù ‘to cause to
feel cold’. Additionally, non-verbal predicative phrases formed by the predicative
relational noun /-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘like’ also belong to pcnà (e.g. /âirű-ràʼǜ̃/ ‘to resemble a
dog’). In the speech of younger smat speakers, however, the inflectional paradigm
of pcnà, although it is still identified as such passively, is being reinterpreted
in active uses of the language as the inflectional paradigm of pcØ involving
associated motion (for the inflectional paradigm of pcØ involving associated motion, see first columns of Charts C–D, G–H, and L–M, pp.449–453; on associated

deliberately vague way, out of self-effacement (in which case tãů is often followed
by a more precise answer) or in order to elude a question (‘Well, nothing special,
(it’s just that …)’), as in the following example (repeated from (450)):312

This pragmatic use of tãů ‘neg’ is likely related to the fact that tãů probably comes from tåʼúʼü̃́

Rhetorical questions are often used to convey an emphatic negative exclamative meaning. In this discursive strategy, the referent asked about is implicitly
meant not to exist, or in other words an interrogative word is used instead of its
corresponding negative existential indefinite (as in e.g. ‘What did he do…?’ =
‘He did (absolutely) nothing!’). This is illustrated in examples (657–658) (see also
(T56)). Compare (657) with (622) for a parallel utterance featuring the corresponding explicitly negative construction. In (658), the corresponding negative sentence
is uttered immediately after the rhetorical question, yielding a binary discursive
structure interrogative.sentence+negative.sentence of relatively common
use in the language:

Interlinearized text: episodes from
the myth of Ngutapa as told by Loida
Ángel Ruiz
This appendix provides a fully interlinearized transcription of about two thirds of
a recording of the first few episodes of the mythological cycle of Ngutapa and
his children as told by Loida Ángel Ruiz (lar, ♀, 49 y.o.). The corresponding
recording (recording C by lar in Table 1) was made on November 5, 2016 in
lar’s house in sma. This recording is 35’17” long altogether, of which the first
21’55” are transcribed in what follows. This entirely monological text is generally
representative of traditional Tikuna mythological storytelling. Note, however, that
I was the only hearer present during most of the performance, which is a highly
unusual speech setting for this kind of Tikuna verbal art.
The cycle of Ngutapa, his two sons Yoi (often called /tă-nátǖ/ (4-father) “our
father” by the Tikunas) and Ipi, and his two daughters is by all accounts (whether
endogenous or exogenous) the most important one in today’s Tikuna mythological repertoire, minimally among the Tikunas of Colombia. It contains, among
many other mythological accounts of elements characteristic of today’s world, an
account of the creation of human beings. For versions of the cycle of Ngutapa in
Western languages, see in particular Nimuendajú (1952:121–137; partly condensed
English version) and Goulard & Montes (2016; extensive Tikuna-Spanish version).
For a discussion of linguistic features typical of Tikuna mythological discourse, see
Gómez-Pulgarín (2012).
For parallel—although often divergent—versions of the episodes transcribed
below, see more specifically Nimuendajú (1952:121–123, 133–134) and Goulard
545& Montes (2016, episodes I–III). Note, importantly, that lar, the speaker of the
recording transcribed below, was part of the transcription and translation committee for Goulard & Montes (2016), which mostly consists in a written version of a
recording of the cycle of Ngutapa told in 1985 and 1988 by Humberto Chetanükü,
a renowned Tikuna storyteller from the upper Loretoyacu river. lar’s version of
the episodes below is therefore heavily influenced by Chetanükü’s version reported
in Goulard & Montes (2016).
An English summary of the episodes transcribed in this appendix is given first in
Section A.1. The fully interlinearized transcription of these episodes is provided
in Section A.2.

"3.6.1Absence of marking on the nominal phrase
(zero-case)I call “zero-case” form the form that NPs feature when they occur extra-syntactically (i.e. their citation form) or the form they typically feature in topicalizing
left-dislocations where they are followed by the enclitic =rǜ ‘top’ (e.g. chàue̋gà
‘my name’ in example (261)). In their zero-case form, NPs can be said to be completely unmarked for syntactic function. All NPs in the zero-case in the examples
displayed in this section are highlighted in bold.

A1]
NPs in the syntactic function of subject (whether subjects of intransitive or
transitive predicative phrases) always occur in the zero-case. Likewise, NPs that
2713. The nominal phrase
correspond to a third person participant assigned to the masculine, neuter, or
non-salientive nominal class always occur in the zero-case in the syntactic
function of object (but not NPs that correspond to first, second, fourth, or third
person feminine or salientive participants in object function; such NPs, by a phenomenon of differential object marking, are typically—but not always—marked
with the accusative case-marking suffix, on which see next section). Depending on
the situation, the syntactic function of such NPs may be encoded either by their
position only (e.g. gűʼü̃́ ‘everything’ in (262), which only its position right before
a transitive predicative phrase indicates to be an object), by indexation only (e.g.
kŏwǘ ‘the deer’ in (263), which only its coreferential index /nā=/ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’
indicates to be an object), or by both their position and indexation (e.g. pêʼrǖpāpa̋ ‘your father’ in (264), which both its position right before an intransitive
predicative phrase and its coreferential index /ná=/ ‘3m/n/ns.sbj’ indicate to be
a subject).

Participants in the accusative and benefactive(-malefactive) syntactic functions are regularly marked with the corresponding case-marking suffixes when they
2723.6. Syntactic functions of nominal phrases
precede the predicative phrase, as in example (265) (on the case-marking suffixes,
see next section). When they follow the predicative phrase, by contrast, they
virtually always occur in the zero-case and get indexed on the predicative
phrase, as in (266) (accusative complements of the deictic verb, however, do retain their dependent-marking when they occur after the deictic verb, which results
from the fact that the inflectional morphology of the deictic verb does not allow for
the indexation of such complements; see Section 6.1, p.507).

The complement of the copular verb root i ̃̊ ‘to be’ is always in the zero-case
(see e.g. the proper noun ‘Javier Sánchez’ in (261), which is morphologically unmarked for syntactic function). Its syntactic function is only encoded by its position
immediately before the copular verb.
NPs in the punctual locative syntactic function are ordinarily marked with
the relational noun /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’. This relational noun is occasionally dropped,
however, with apparently no resulting effect of any sort. This seems to be possible only in cases where the NP in that syntactic function precedes the predicative
phrase. See, for instance, the NP náʼma̋rṵ̈ʼü ‘(in) its anus’ in the following example,
whose punctual locative syntactic function is morphologically covert:
(267)[...] wíʼámḛʼemáʼa gá nôʼtáã ́ ãʼ̄ a náʼma̋rṵ̈ʼü ãʼ̄ a tàyā-we̋ʼü̃́ ãʼ̄ a gà gûmà quena

thrust the flute into its [i.e. the jaguar’s] anus.’ [lar D159–160]
For additional instances of ellipsis of /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, see tüĝ üʼ̀ étǜ ‘(on) their own eyes’
̀ üt̄ ānǜ lit. ‘(in) a group of companions of mine’ in
in example (467) and chòmük
(574).
Finally, certain adjuncts, such as the circumstantial independent nouns (a
subclass of independent nouns referring to positions in time or space) or the complements of duration (as in e.g. I worked there for three years), are never marked
for syntactic function. Their position in the clause does not seem to be able to
provide any indication as to their syntactic function either. In other words, the func̃́
tion of such NPs is entirely covert. Contrast the temporal adjunct wíʼá gá g̃ùnēʼügù
́ á ‘(in)
‘one day’ in (268) with the temporal adjuncts ñṵmá ‘nowadays’ and nůʼkümthe past’ in (262) above. All three NPs can reasonably be considered to feature
the same semantic role. However, while the former is marked with the punctual
́ á ‘in the past’, two cirlocative relational noun /-gu̽/, ñṵmá ‘nowadays’ and nůʼküm
cumstantial independent nouns, do not display any syntactic function marking.

"5.10Strategies for encoding the number ofparticipantsNumber may be analyzed, to a certain extent, as an inflectional category of the
smat predicative phrase. Its encoding cannot be attributed to a single, relatively
straightforwardly identifiable locus, however, in the way that e.g. associated motion or predicative class can be. In practice, no less than seven different strategies
can be identified as contributing to the encoding within the finite predicative
phrase of the value of the number feature of arguments.
From a morphological perspective, these seven strategies variously rely on:
– the selection of particular inflectional indexes (e.g. /chā=/ ‘1sg.sbj’ vs
/tā=/ ‘1pl.sbj’), particular allomorphs of certain verb roots (e.g. ṹ ‘go.sg’
vs i ̃̂ ‘go.pl’), or particular allomorphs or certain derivational suffixes when
present (e.g. /-ē/ ‘off.sg’ vs /-ü̃̀/ ‘off.pl’);
– the addition of particular suffixes to the predicative phrase (/-ē/ ‘intr.pl’
and/or /-gǘ/ ‘pl’);
– or the reassignment of the predicative phrase to a predicative class that departs from its lexical one (pcØ>pci ̄ in specific circumstances).
From a semantic perspective, they may variously encode either the singular, plural, or collective value (or a value that is a combination of these) of the number feature of either a subject, object, accusative, or benefactive argument.
Only one of them is of strictly obligatory application, specifically the one that operates through inflectional index selection. Note that it is frequent for several of
them (from two to at least four) to be simultaneously—and often redundantly—
applied within the same predicative phrase (see for instance example (574) below, which features a predicative phrase within which the plurality of the sub̂
ject argument is encoded via three different strategies: /nű=ĩ-gǘ-è
tānǖ-ʼü̃́/ (ctrpet.3aloc=go.pl-pl-distr.pl\sbjv-rel.ns) ‘[who] came, each of them, from
4875. Inflection of the predicative phrase
[another community]’).
These strategies are dealt with one by one in the following paragraphs following an arrangement that roughly goes from the one that is encoded in the leftmost locus to the one that is encoded in the rightmost locus within the inflected
predicative phrase. The section closes with a brief discussion of the inflectional
character of number encoding in smat.
(i) Index selection. The singular vs plural (or collective) value of the number
feature of first and second person benefactive, accusative, and subject arguments is obligatorily encoded through the selection of the corresponding singular
or plural indexes in slots 1, 2, and 4—respectively—of the inflectional template of
the predicative phrase, whenever such indexes are present. Note, importantly, that
third and fourth person indexes in any of these slots are, by contrast, always unspecified for number. On these indexes, see Section 5.1, and in particular Tables 39
and 40, p.393.
This typologically unsurprising strategy for number encoding is illustrated
by the contrast between examples (559) and (560) (repeated from (459) above).
These nearly parallel examples mainly differ in the selection of the subject indexes
featured in their predicative phrases, namely a second person singular subject index
in (559) as opposed to a second person plural subject index in (560).

(ii) Predicative class reassignment. The collective value of the number
feature of the subject argument of stative intransitive predicative phrases lexically
belonging to pcØ may be optionally made explicit by the reassignment of such
predicative phrases to pci ̄. On this phenomenon, see Section 5.9, 482.
4885.10. Strategies for participants number encoding
This strategy is illustrated by the contrast between examples (561) and (562).
The same predicative phrase, i ̏ʼrà ‘be small’, is employed in both examples. In
the former, this predicative phrase is inflected in its lexical predicative class, pcØ,
leaving the number of its subject argument unspecified (in this case, the subject—
the city of Leticia—is contextually singular). In the latter example, by contrast, the
same predicative phrase is inflected in the predicative class pci ̄, which explicitly
indicates that its subject argument is a collective entity (in this case, the trees of a
patch of jungle).

223]
(iii) Verb allomorph selection. The singular vs plural (or collective) value
of the number feature of the subject argument of certain verbal intransitive predicative phrases, and that of the object argument of certain verbal transitive predicative phrases, is regularly—although not entirely systematically—encoded through
the selection of one or the other of the two suppletive forms of the verb root on
which these predicative phrases are based.
The verb roots that inflect for number as per the phenomenon just described are
listed in Table 47. Note, incidentally, that almost all of them denote localization or motion processes, to the exception of the verb meaning ‘to kill’. Verbal
predicative phrases derived from any of these verb roots select for their singular
or plural allomorphs following the same principle as these verb roots themselves
(e.g. sg. /ǘ-pétǜ/, pl. /chó-pétǜ/ ‘to pass’, derived from ü/́ chó ‘to find oneself
(sg./pl.)’ through the addition of the suffix /-pétǜ/ ‘across’). Three fully lexicalized
and, to a certain extent, irregular verb stems based on the verb roots inflecting for
number are included in this table, however. The singular forms of two of them,

Note that in this last example, the speaker is outlining the array of possible activities
he may carry out in any relative order in a given situation. He is not describing
a schedule with a planned temporal order, in which case predicative phrases in
sbjv-ʼü̃́ would have been expected where this example features predicative phrases
in ind.
By contrast with the examples just discussed (which illustrate the default use of
ind in contexts where it does not contrast with sbjv-ʼü̃́), the following two pieces
of sustained speech provide good illustrations of the typical contrastive uses of
ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́, specifically in narrative discourse (454) and in procedural discourse (455). The respective discursive functions (as identified above on p.401) of
predicative phrases in ind in these examples are indicated in the translation line.
Note that these examples include two occurrences (in (454c) and (455d), specifically) of predicative phrases in ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses that
can apparently not be properly accounted for by the distributional interpretation
of ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́ provided in the present section.

A relatively obvious but important remark regarding the notion of advancement
of narrative time encoded by predicative forms in sbjv-ʼü̃́ is in order. The new reference time established by a given [+ant] predicative phrase does not systematically follow the reference time of the last [+ant] predicative phrase uttered by
the speaker. As is to be expected, [+ant] predicative forms are not necessarily
organized in linear and single-leveled chains, although they often are (as in a
piece of discourse such as ‘An event A occurred. After A, an event B occurred. After
B, an event C occurred. After C, an event D occurred, etc.’). As a consequence, the
reference time of the process encoded by a given [+ant] predicative form may in
practice coincide with, be included within, or even precede, the reference time of
the process encoded by the last [+ant] predicative form uttered by the speaker.
In example (456), for instance, the processes encoded by two [+ant] predicative forms uttered consecutively by the speaker (labelled processes B and C in the
translation line) occur in practice at a single reference time rt2, because both are to
be interpreted as advancing narrative time relative to the reference time rt1 of the
process encoded by the first uttered [+ant] predicative form (labelled process A).
To put it more simply, the tourists’ resting and the speaker’s resting, which are in
practice two parallel events that roughly coincide temporally (occurring at rt2),
are both encoded with [+ant] predicative phrases because they are conceived of
as two distinct processes each of which occurs as a next step relative to the eating
(which occurred at rt1).

33–35]
Mere repetition (as in (455h–455i)) and reformulation (as in (454h–454i))
are frequent and simpler cases in which the processes encoded by two consecutive
[+ant] predicative phrases occur in practice at the exact same reference time.
When a speaker repeats or reformulates an utterance containing a [+ant] predicative phrase, they do not intend to refer to two distinct and temporally consecutive
processes. In fact, they are referring twice to the same process, and the two [+ant]
predicative phrases referring to that single process equally signal that the process
takes place at a reference time that follows the reference time of a previously mentioned process.
The reference times of the processes encoded by [+ant] predicative phrases
uttered consecutively within a given piece of discourse may thus relate with one
another in all kinds of complex discursive structures. These will not be studied in
detail here however, as they do not directly relate to the language’s morphosyntax,
but rather to its discourse pragmatics.
In relation to the intricacies of the notion of advancement of narrative time, note
also that sbjv-ʼü̃́ occasionally replaces ind in the latter’s regular use to initiate
a series of major events (on this use of ind, see (455a) above). In this particular
case, a predicative phrase in sbjv-ʼü̃́ does not—strictly speaking—advance narrative
time relative to a previously established reference time (no such reference time
having been established yet), but merely signals the start of a sequence involving
narrative time, as in the following example, which occurs at the very beginning of
a story:

The tentative interpretation put forward in this section to account for the functional contrast that occurs between ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses is
admittedly framed in the terms of a typologically non-familiar contrast between
non-advancement vs advancement of narrative time. An alternative framing in
terms of imperfective or unbounded aspect (ind) vs perfective or bounded
aspect (sbjv-ʼü̃́) would certainly give a more familiar look to this grammatical
contrast from the perspective of most linguists.
However, note that processes that would typically be expected to be encoded
with perfective or bounded aspect in other languages are regularly inflected
in ind in smat, most noticeably in the following contexts (repeated from the list
on p.401):
– when the speaker mentions preliminary minor events (e.g. ‘He eventually
spotted.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a monkey. He came closer.ind and he shot.sbjv-ʼü̃́ it.’);
– when the speaker recapitulates a previous major event (e.g. ‘And then he came
down.sbjv-ʼü̃́. So, he came down.ind, and then he started.sbjv-ʼü̃́ to speak.’);
– when the speaker initiates a series of major events (e.g. ‘Once upon a time, a
man went.ind into the jungle. There he found.sbjv-ʼü̃́ a deer.’).
Conversely, processes that would typically be expected to be encoded with
imperfective or unbounded aspect in other languages are occasionally—although rarely—inflected in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in smat (as in (455d)). In view of these
observations, I believe that a typologically more familiar interpretation of the ind
vs sbjv-ʼü̃́ contrast in smat declarative main clauses in terms of imperfective vs perfective aspects would in practice unduly obliterate a significant part of the specifics
of that grammatical contrast.","[408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416]"

The index /i ̋=/ ‘3aloc’ may also stand for a dative participant referring to
the animate ground of a motion event (lit. ‘to/from her/him/them’), although
such occurrences are relatively rare. This mostly occurs in association with the verb
kà (pcØ), which in the absence of a dative participant means ‘to call (over)’ (i.e. to
request attention or a physical spontaneous motion on the part of an addressee
conceived of as a figure themselves), but in the presence of such a participant
means ‘to ask for (an information or an object)’ (i.e. to request the—metaphorical
or physical—caused motion of a figure away from an addressee conceived of as a
ground). Indexing a dative participant on this verb, in cases where it is intended
to mean ‘to ask for’ but where that dative participant is not expressed as a NP preceding the predicative phrase, is therefore crucial for its correct interpretation. The
4605.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types
dative participant in example (517a) is expressed as a NP that precedes the predicative phrase (in this case, an independent pronoun, /nü̂-ʼnà/ [3n/ns-dat] ‘from
him’). Consequently, the predicative phrase /tà=kă-ʼǘ̃/ (3s.sbj\sbjv=ask\sbjvsub) ‘he asked’ does not bear any indexation of a dative participant. In (517b), by
contrast, which immediately follows the utterance in (517a), the dative participant
is further backgrounded by no longer being expressed as a separate NP. As a consequence, the predicative phrase /i ̋=tá=kà/ (3aloc=3s.sbj=ask) ‘he asked’ must
index a dative participant by means of /i ̋=/. In the absence of any marking for a
dative participant, the utterance would be interpreted as ‘he called luck over (i.e.
to come to him)’ (for an instance of a construction involving kà in its meaning ‘to
call (over)’, see (234)).

The areal locative index /i ̋=/ ‘3aloc’ may further stand for a duration complement (lit. ‘for it’), although note that such complements, when expressed as
NPs, are not usually marked with the areal locative relational noun /-wa̋/ but left in
the zero-case instead (but see (T44) for an instance of such a complement—in this
case a relative clause—marked with /-wa̋/). In example (518), /i ̋=/ in the relative clause /nű-à i ̋=chī=pūrākü̋-ʼü̃́/ (prox.aloc-exo 3aloc=1sg.sbj.pci ̄.sbjv=
work\sbjv-sub), lit. ‘[the time] that I’ve been working here for it’, is a resumptive
index standing for the pivot, which serves as a duration complement within the
relative clause:
(518)“[...] ñåà níì-ĩ ̊ ì tiempo i ̀ nűà i ̋chī-pūrāküʼ̋ ü̃́ [...].”

“My name is such and such,] I’ve been working here for this long [lit. ‘this

Apart from its function as an index, /i ̋=/ also frequently serves as a mere progressive aspect marker (expressing an aspectual notion comparable to the one
encoded by the English be+-ing construction). This function of /i ̋=/ is very likely
to be derived from its function as an index for a duration complement just discussed.
Possibly the only difference between contexts where /i ̋=/ serves as an index for
a duration complement and contexts where it functions as a progressive marker
is that an explicit duration referent is present in the former (e.g. tiempo ‘time’ in
(518)) while no such referent is explicitly identified in the latter. This is why I use
the same gloss for /i ̋=/ whether it functions as an index or as an aspect marker. Instances of /i ̋=/ in its function as a progressive marker are featured in the following
two examples ((520) is repeated from (324) for convenience; see also (T104)):

they founded this community], Agua Blanca [i.e. a river a couple of hours
upriver of San Martín].’ [jsg A355–357]
Note that the index /ne̋=/nű=/ is employed even when the ground participant it indexes is already expressed as a NP in front of the predicative phrase
(which is virtually always the case in practice), as long as that participant is to be
interpreted as the source of a centripetal motion, as in examples (522) and (523).
Participants with most other syntactic functions are normally not indexed on the
predicative phrase when they are syntactically present as a NP preceding it.

provisions, the food, for them [i.e. the elders] [...].’ [jsg A200]
In other words, the presence of the index /ne̋=/nű=/ is what signals that the motion is centripetal, which is why it must remain on the predicative phrase whether
it functions as an ordinary index (in the absence of a coreferential NP preceding the
predicative phrase) or as a kind of agreement marker (in the presence of a coreferential NP preceding the predicative phrase). In the absence of /ne̋=/nű=/, the
same areal locative participant would be interpreted as the goal of a non-centripetal
motion ((522), for instance, would then be interpreted as ‘The tourists go everywhere.’).
Note that although (521–523) refer to centripetal motions oriented towards the
speaker themselves, as is frequently the case, this need not always be the case. Centripetal motions can be conceived of as motions whose path is oriented towards the
most activated ground topic, which indeed often, but not always, coincides with
the location of the speaker (see (574) for an occurrence of /ne̋=/nű=/ contributing to the encoding of a centripetal motion not oriented towards the speaker).
The distribution between the variants /ne̋=/ and /nű=/ is a subdialectal
one, with most speakers using the former (lar, jsg, igv, among others) and only
a few speakers using the latter (among whom jgs and gsg).
(iii) /i ̀=/ ‘3ploc’. Although its exact distribution remains unclear, the morpheme /i ̀=/ seems to function essentially as an index standing for a third person
punctual locative (ploc) participant, as in the following example:
(524)̃́
“Chòmà rǜ tá, kóyàʼü̃̀ tá níì-ĩ ̊ i ̀ chàgǜ {?} tá ìchà-üʼ̂ ü.”

surroundings] under the shape of a caiman.”’ [lar T153]
4645.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types
In this example, /i ̀=/ is most likely added to the predicative phrase because the
speaker feels that the verb ǘ ‘to put (sg.)’, being a motion verb, and more specifically
a non-durative one (on the distinction between durative vs non-durative motion
verb roots, see Section 4.2.3), semantically requires a locative complement, and
more specifically a ploc one, although there is no need for mentioning any specific
locative complement in the context. Note, however, that /i ̀=/ is optional in this
utterance (as was confirmed to me by ear, with the help of whom I transcribed the
utterance in (524)) and does not contribute any referential meaning. In most of its
occurrences, the index /i ̀=/ thus seems to serve, like in (524), as a mere optional
filler for a semantically called for but morphosyntactically optional complement position. In my data, such occurrences of /i ̀=/ are especially frequent in
association with the verbs tó ‘to plant’ and g̃û/yi ̀ ‘to fall (sg./pl.)’.
For unclear reasons, inflected occurrences of the verb gṵ (pcØ/pci ̄) ‘to finish’
especially frequently include /i ̀=/ when that verb specifically means ‘to reach its
end (at a certain point in space or in a discourse performance)’. In co-occurrence
with this verb, /i ̀=/ typically remains even in the presence of a ploc NP preceding the predicative phrase (which is not the case with the verbs just mentioned
above). This is shown in the following example (contrast, however, example (164),
an essentially parallel example that does not involve the co-occurrence of /i ̀=/
with gṵ ‘to reach its end’):
(525)Ngĕʼmá níì-ĩ ̊ i ̀ ngēmà ìnà-gűʼü̃́ ērǘ ná-nûʼu.
ngĕʼ-máníì=ĩ ̊i ̀=ngē-màmed.ploc-anaph 3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀=be lk.ns=med.ns-anaphì=nà=gű-ʼü̃́3ploc=3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=finish\sbjv-subērǘ ná=nûʼu‘[At the end of a second story shorter than the first:] This one ends here
because it’s a short one.’ [igs 288]
It could be that the presence of /i ̀=/ in finite forms of certain predicative phrases
has lexicalized to the point of tending to become obligatory in any context.277
The morpheme /i ̀=/ is homonymous with a handful of other morphemes
in the language, in particular /i ̀=/ ‘pcø.sbjv’, /i ̀=/ ‘pci ̄\sbjv’, /i ̀=/ ‘pci ̀’, /i ̀=/
‘pci ̀.sbjv’, and /i ̀=/ ‘lk.ns’. This often seriously complicates its identification,
Compare the French lexicalized phrase y aller ‘to leave’ (lit. ‘to go to it’) as in Je vais devoir y
aller ‘I should probably get going’, which likewise involves a non-referential spatial index y.
2774655. Inflection of the predicative phrase
not only to the foreign analyst but possibly also to speakers themselves. This might
explain why some speakers occasionally use /i ̋=/ where /i ̀=/ could have been expected, thereby generalizing the use of /i ̋=/ to the indexation of both aloc and
ploc participants. Thus, while the locative complement that the verb ãu
̰ ‘to stay’
̂
̋ -ʼü̃́/
takes is normally a ploc complement, the relative clause /nü-mà i ̋=nà=ãu
(3n/ns-anaph 3aloc=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=stay\sbjv-rel.ns) ‘where he is’
in example (526), which precisely relativizes a complement of that verb, does not
feature the ploc index /i ̀=/ to resumptively stand for the pivot, but the aloc index
/i ̋=/ instead:

be the same slot as the third person locative participant indexes (for why I hypothesize these two types of indexes to belong to the same slot, see introduction to
Section 5.7.2 above). These partitive object indexes are part of an intricate system of encoding of partitively affected third person objects. This grammatical
system is of relatively unfrequent use in discourse. Note that due to the limited
number of unequivocal instances of its use in my corpus, the analysis of it I present
here relies for a large part on elicited utterances and must therefore be considered
as tentative.
Masculine partitive objects are indexed on the predicative phrase by means
of a proclitic /nè=/, neuter ones by means of /ne̋=/ (which possibly displays a
subdialectal variant /nű=/), and non-salientive ones by means of /tà=/ (whose
identification may be complicated by the fact that it is homonymous with several
other morphemes in the language, in particular /=tà/ ‘add’). As discussed below,
feminine and salientive partitive objects, which do not have dedicated indexes,
can only be referred to pronominally by means of independent pronouns in the
partitive case. Instances of use of /ne̋=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ and /tà=/ ‘3ns.part.obj’
4665.7. Indexes common to the three Inflectional Types
as ordinary indexes (i.e. elements referring to the participant in the absence of a
NP referring to it in front of the predicative phrase) are provided in examples (527)
and (528), respectively. The nominal class of the indexed partitive objects in these
two examples (n and ns, respectively) is clear from the context.
(527)Ne̋chà-ngőʼü.̃́ne̋=chà=ngő-ʼü̃́3n.part.obj=1sg.sbj\sbjv=eat\sbjv-sub‘[I climbed a tree to pick some guavas(.n).] I ate some.’ [igv 380]

who keep injuring my animals(.ns)?] If that’s what you want, kill some
properly!”’ [gra 276]
The partitive object indexes remain, however, in the presence of a NP that is coreferential with them and precedes the predicative phrase, as shown in example (529).
This is most likely because they are the only way to indicate that the object is partitively, and not totally, affected in the process (see Section 5.7.2.1, paragraph
(ii) above for the similar case of the index /ne̋=/nű=/ ‘ctrpet.3aloc’ remaining
in the presence, in front of the predicative phrase, of a NP coreferential with the
participant it indexes).

these, uh... guavas.”’ [igv 382]
As shown in examples (530) and (531), the encoding of masculine partitive
objects is highly anomalous in that it involves the obligatory indexation of the
participant on the predicative phrase not only as the index /nè=/ ‘3m.part.obj’,
but also, simultaneously, as an ordinary core object index (represented by /nā=/
in (530) and /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’ in (531)). This intriguing feature was confirmed
during elicitation sessions to be regular.

The encoding of feminine and salientive partitive objects involves the use of
the independent pronouns bearing the partitive suffix -ʼnè, i.e. /ngi ̂-ʼnè/ (3fpart) and /tü̂-ʼnè/ (3s-part). Note that the partitive suffix -ʼnè is only attested
in these morphological compounds in my corpus. The partitive object pronouns
ngi ̂ʼnè and tüʼ̂ nè, similarly to the partitive object indexes discussed above, may serve
either as ordinary pronouns, as in (532), or as a kind of resumptive pronoun that
is coreferential with a NP that precedes the predicative phrase, as in (533). In the
latter case, the partitive object pronoun is likely maintained because it is the only
available strategy for encoding grammatically the fact that the object is partitively,
not totally, affected in the process.

The neuter partitive object index /ne̋=/ is relatively well attested in a specific
kind of intransitive construction where it cannot, by definition, function as an index
for a partitive object, but functions instead as what could be characterized as an index for a partitive areal locative participant. In this construction, which always
features an areal locative participant referring to a static location or a goal ground
(in practice, nű [prox.aloc] ‘all around here’ or /gű-ʼü̃́-wa̋/ [finish\sbjv-rel.nsaloc] ‘everywhere’), /ne̋=/ explicitly indicates that the process only occurs in or
towards most—but not all—subparts of the ground, which is not to be conceived
of as an indivisible whole but rather as a set of potentially involved “sub-grounds”.
Note that in this specific use, the partitive index /ne̋=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ is also attested under a subdialectal variant /nű=/ (compare the variants /ne̋=/nű=/ of
the areal locative index discussed in Section 5.7.2.1, paragraph (ii) above).
Thus, in example (534), the presence of /nű=/ explicitly indicates that the
speaker did not literally go everywhere in the region, but to most places in the
region, in a spontaneous and cumulative fashion, rather than in an organized and
systematic way:

770]
Likewise, in (535), the presence of /nű=/ indicates that Peta-Peta did not literally
examine all the parts of the body of the Tikuna man, but most of its parts:278
278The subtle shade of meaning contributed by /ne̋=/nű=/ ‘3n.part.obj’ in this construction is4695.8. Associated motion (slot 5)
that this grammatical category is particularly common in the languages of the western half of the Amazonian basin, among which it is highly likely to have spread by
contact (2016). Associated motion in smat is a semantically fairly simple category
that essentially contributes meanings such as ‘go/come (i.e. undergo a motion
unspecified for path) and perform the main process denoted by the lexical
component of the predicative phrase’, as shown in the following example:
(536)“Ngü,̂ chā-pūrākǘã̰ níì-ĩ ̊ rǜ kǘ chārǖ finca pēyàrǖ-chĕʼgü!̋ ” ñâʼü.̃́ Nge̋mà gá,

go (pl.) clear my farm [i.e. from unwanted vegetation with a machete]!”
he said. And then there was a fifteen-day vacation period and we went and
worked there.’ [jgs 694–698]
Note that associated motion is relatively rare in smat discourse, with motion of
subject arguments being much more frequently expressed by lexical means, i.e. by
means of specialized verbs of motion.
Associated motion in smat belongs to the grammatical categories that are encoded through the inflectional morphology of the finite predicative phrase (it
occupies a morphological slot of its own—slot 5—within the inflectional template of
the predicative phrase, although its encoding is in practice often merged into portmanteau morphemes together with the encoding of categories belonging in neighboring slots; see Section 5.1). It may consequently only occur in finite predicative phrases. This clearly distinguishes it from the semantically close but separate
smat category of “direction” (grammatical encoding of the “path” of a location or
a motion), which is encoded by means of derivational suffixes (see Section 4.2.3).
The exponent of associated motion is a proclitic morpheme /yà=/, which either encodes associated motion alone, as in example (536), or is a portmanteau
morpheme that simultaneously serves as an exponent for associated motion and a
third person index and/or the Subjunctive Inflectional Type, as in (541) (on /yà=/

The encoding of a round-trip or circular path281 within a single predicative phrase
(as in e.g. ‘go and come back’, whether taking the same route or different routes),
in particular, is apparently regularly obtained by the combination of associated
motion with a motion verb suffixed with the figure-ground configuration morpheme
/-ègù/ ‘inv’ (yielding complex predicative phrases with literal meanings such as ‘go
and [perform the lexically-encoded motion event back to the initial point]’). The
following two examples feature instances of such a combination:

... -3m/n/ns.objThe first row in the figure assigns a specific number to each of the eight morphological slots in the template, from 1 to 8 (PP stands for “predicative phrase”).
This numeration will be kept throughout this chapter. The paradigms of morphemes
available in slots 4 to 8 display slight variations depending on which of the three
Inflectional Types (or “moods”, so to say) the predicative phrase is inflected in.
Those in slots 1 to 3, by contrast, are identical across the three Inflectional Types.
All the morphemes that belong in slots 1 to 7 are proclitics that immediately precede the predicative phrase. By contrast, the one and only morpheme available in
slot 8 is a suffix that is immediately attached to the right edge of the predicative
phrase. Note that in a number of cases, within the domain of slots 4 to 7, a single
fusional (or portmanteau) morpheme simultaneously fills two of the slots, or, in
other words, encodes the combination of the features belonging functionally to two
distinct slots.
The second row in the figure above is roughly devised like a gloss. To each
slot corresponds an abbreviation that refers to the main function fulfilled by that
slot. These abbreviations are to be understood as follows:
– ben: indexation of a benefactive participant;
– acc: indexation of an accusative participant;
– loc/part: indexation of a locative or partitive object participant;
– sbj: indexation of the subject argument;
– am: encoding of associated motion;
– pc: encoding of the predicative class (or “conjugation class”);
– 3: indexation of a third person (masculine, neuter, non-salientive, or feminine) subject or (core) object argument;
– 3m/n/ns.obj: indexation of a third person (masculine, neuter, or nonsalientive) (core) object argument.
Importantly, recall that, as this list suggests, the inflectional template of the predicative phrase in smat does not directly encode any notions of tense, aspect, mood,
3915. Inflection of the predicative phrase
or evidentiality (see the introduction to this chapter for a brief discussion of this
point).
Note that the figure above is meant to be no more than a practical summary. As such, it assembles within a single template morphological slots that
may rarely, or never, co-occur within a single inflected predicative phrase.
In fact, the eight slots in this figure can never be filled simultaneously, although
all of them can be argued to constitute separate slots. In practice, inflected predicative phrases with more than four of these slots filled are rarely to be found in
spontaneous speech, and under certain conditions it may even happen that a given
inflected predicative phrase has none of these slots filled. Note also, importantly,
that in the figure above the major distinction between the three Inflectional Types
of the language is ignored. This is because the category of Inflectional Type is not
straightforwardly encoded by a particular slot within the inflectional template of
the predicative phrase, but by a complex combination of factors that may operate
in one or several of slots 4 to 8, and/or in the predicative phrase itself. The formal
and functional characteristics of the three Inflectional Types are introduced in the
next section.
Tables 39 and 40 provide the detailed set of the values that can be encoded
in each of slots 1 to 3 (Table 39) and slots 4 to 8 (Table 40) of the inflectional
template of the predicative phrase. Note that Table 40 puts together all of the values that are found across the three Inflectional Types. In fact, none of the Inflectional Types allows to encode that complete set of values, although each does
allow to encode most of them. By contrast, all of the values listed in Table 39 can
be encoded in all three Inflectional Types. Note also that the morpheme shapes
listed in Table 40 for each value are only indicative. In fact, only one of them
(/-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’) stands in a strict bijective relation with respect to the value
that corresponds to it in Table 40. But the rest of these morpheme shapes can be
said to be “basic” inasmuch as they are relatively frequent exponents of their corresponding values and can be argued to be the etymological building blocks of all
of the other existing exponents of these values described in detail in Sections 5.3
through 5.5. By contrast, all of the morpheme shapes listed in Table 39 stand
in an essentially bijective relation with their corresponding values.
As shown in these tables, the values that can be encoded by the benefactive
participant index (slot 1), the accusative participant index (slot 2), and the subject
index (slot 4) are identical sets of combinations of person & number features or
person & nominal class features. The third person index in slot 3 may either stand
for a locative participant (in the areal locative or in the punctual locative syntactic

"6.2Inflectional morphology6.2.1Synchronic descriptionThe deictic verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ is inflectionally extremely irregular. Its complete paradigm is shown in Table 48 (contrast it with the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases shown in Charts A–M, pp. 449–
453).
Two forms, with a syllable in parentheses in Table 48, have alternative realizations in apparent free variation: /ngi ́-rǖgǜ/ ∼ /ngi ́-rǖrǖgǜ/ and /ña̋-tà[-ʼü̃́]/ (rare)
∼ /ña̋-tà-gǜ[-ʼǘ̃]/ (frequent). The latter pair of forms are occasionally truncated to
their first syllable, yielding ña̋, as in the following example:

[ano1 9–10]
The verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ only rarely occurs in ind and imp in
my data. The vast majority of its occurrences in my corpus are in sbjv/-ʼü̃́/,
presumably because it is mostly found in narratives with the typical sequencing
(i.e. [+ant]) effect of sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ (see Section 5.2.2). Occurrences of /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ in bare sbjv are rare, and all of them co-occur with a relativizer or the
clause-level inflectional morpheme /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’. This is why sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ forms (with
/-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ set apart in square brackets) are reported in Table 48 instead of bare
sbjv forms. There is no reason to believe, however, that standalone bare sbjv

required (see Section 5.2.5). Such standalone forms could of course turn out to be
slightly different from the ones tentatively suggested in Table 48 by the bracketing
out of /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’ from the sbjv/-ʼǘ̃/ forms.
Especially noteworthy is the fact that the subject indexes of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+
-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’, when present, are for the most part encoded by means of suffixes (/-chā/ ‘1sg.sbj’, /-kū/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which follow the stressed syllable of the
phonological word they belong to) instead of the functionally equivalent proclitics featured by the inflectional paradigm of regular predicative phrases (/chā=/
‘1sg.sbj’, /kū=/ ‘2sg.sbj’, etc., which precede the stressed syllable of the phonological word they belong to). Two inflectional forms of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ are even more exceptional: in /ngi ́-(rǖ)rǖgǜ/ ‘she does thus’ (ind) and /ngi ́[ʼǘ̃]/ ‘(that) she does thus’ (sbjv[/-ʼǘ̃/]), the exponent of the third person feminine
subject index, /ngi ́-/, is identical to the Allomorph 1 of the (stressed) pronominal
root /ngi ́-/ ‘3f’ (on the morphology of the pronominal roots, see Section 3.3.1).
Nowhere else in the inflectional paradigms of smat predicative phrases is the exponent of a subject index a stressed syllable, nor more specifically a personal root.293
Moreover, unlike regular predicative phrases, the deictic verb does not allow for
These two highly unexpected forms are unfortunately hard to interpret from a diachronic perspective. They could be analyzed as either inflectional fossils or late innovations.
2935126.2. Inflectional morphology
the indexation of arguments with any syntactic functions other than subject. It cannot receive the proclitics indexing arguments in accusative, in particular (on
these morphemes, see Section 5.7), although its valency does provide a position
for a syntactically explicit complement in accusative (see Section 6.1).
Another noteworthy morphological peculiarity of the verb /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/
‘do thus’, as discussed at the beginning of Section 6, is that it is best treated, from
a synchronic perspective, as a unique case of bipartite morpheme. This results
from the fact that its two separable morphological components, /ña̋-/ñâ-/ on the
one hand and /-((rǖ)gǜ)/ on the other—the latter being absent from certain inflectional forms—cannot be attributed separate functional contributions in today’s
smat and must consequently be considered to constitute a single functional unit.
Smat does not feature any other such bipartite morphemes.
Because the inflectional paradigm of /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’ is formally
so different from that of regular predicative phrases (and, among them, regular
verbs), the deictic “verb” could in strict logic be treated and labelled as a separate part of speech of its own, rather than as a verb. Note, however, that it inflects for the exact same categories as a regular predicative phrase (for Inflectional
Type in particular), and that it may receive at least a few derivational suffixes of
the (regular) predicative phrase (see Section 6.3). I call /ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do
thus’ a “verb”, in the broad sense, insofar as only verbs, among the regular predicative phrases with which it patterns, similarly consist in a functionally unanalyzable
lexical form.
The manner deictic word ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in this manner’, which occurs with both endophoric and exophoric uses (on these notions, see Section 6.1), is very likely to
have resulted historically from the combination of a bare sbjv form *ñâ ‘do.thus.
̀ ǜ/ ‘man’, with
3m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv’ and the clause-level inflectional morpheme /-ãk
the literal meaning ‘in the manner of him/her/it doing like this’. Note however that
ñâak̃̀ ǜ has become unanalyzable and invariable in today’s smat, as shown in ex̀ ǜ/ (‘do.thus-1sg.sbj\sbjvample (597).294 In this example, a form like ? /ña̋-chà-ãk
man’) lit. ‘in the manner of me doing like this’ would have been expected otherwise, given that the subject of the main verb is a first person singular:This comment also applies to ñâak̃̀ ǜ in its frequent occurrences in association with the interrogative word ñùʼ(u) ‘what activity?’ yielding the invariable phrase ñùʼ(u) ñâak̃̀ ǜ ‘in what manner?
how?’ (on the interrogative word ñùʼ(u), see end of Section 6.1).

"3.5.1Morphological paradigmThe morphological paradigm of the linker is displayed in Table 34 in its three
subdialectal variants classified by degree of conservativeness or innovativeness.
The inflectional forms of the linker unspecified for nominal tense, which are in
practice mostly used in non-past ([-pst]) contexts, are laid out in the first row of
each subdialectal variant of the paradigm. Its specifically past inflectional forms
([+pst]) are laid out in the second row of each variant.

Table 34. Morphological paradigm of the smat linker (including subdialectal variants)The only forms concerned by the subdialectal variation featured by the inflectional paradigm of the linker are the neuter and the salientive forms (the forms
highlighted in bold in the intermediary and innovative variants of the paradigm
in Table 34 are the ones that differ from their equivalent forms in the conservative variant of the paradigm). This variation is only of a tonological (i.e. not a
segmental) nature. Note, importantly, that this subdialectal variation is the reason
for the apparent inconsistency in the way the forms of the linker are glossed in the
examples throughout this grammatical description. Apparently identical forms of
the linker are necessarily glossed differently across speakers whose speeches make
use of distinct variants of the inflectional paradigm of the linker.
In the conservative variant of the paradigm (first two rows in Table 34), both
the neuter and the salientive forms of the linker (whether its forms unspecified for
nominal tense or its specifically [+pst] forms) exhibit a toneme /1 /. The reason I
identify this variant as comparatively conservative is because it is the one employed
by all the oldest speakers (i.e. those above age 60, approximately) who have collaborated in my research, regardless of their geographical origins (igs, hga, osp,
and gra in particular; certain younger speakers also use this variant, such as jgs).
In the intermediary variant of the inflectional paradigm of the linker (third
and fourth rows in Table 34), the neuter forms likewise exhibit a toneme /1 /, but
the salientive forms, for their part, exhibit a toneme /4 / (thereby aligning with the
masculine forms of all three variants of the paradigm of the linker). Only lar,
among the speakers who collaborated in my research, employs this variant. She
also uses, on rare occasions, the conservative variant (i.e. she occasionally uses
2533. The nominal phrase
the toneme /4 / variants of the salientive forms of the linker). The intermediary
variant can minimally be characterized as such from a structural point of view,
with respect to the conservative variant on the one hand and the innovative one on
the other. I tentatively hypothesize that it is also, diachronically, the bridge variant
that allowed the conservative variant to evolve into the innovative variant.
Finally, in the innovative variant of the inflectional paradigm of the linker
(last two rows in Table 34), both the neuter and the salientive forms exhibit a
toneme /4 / (thereby aligning with the masculine forms). This variant is the one
that displays most syncretism. The non-past form /yá=/ is indiscriminately used
in the masculine, neuter, and salientive nominal classes. The past form /gá=/, for
its part, can be said to no longer agree for nominal class, given that it is used in
all of them. I identify this variant of the paradigm of the linker as innovative both
because it is mostly used by younger speakers (e.g. jsg and igv), and because it
allows to encode less grammatical distinctions than the other two variants (i.e. it
most likely represents a simplification of one of the other two paradigms, which
must therefore have been prior in time).
Note that there is the possibility that more forms of the linker exist besides
those listed in Table 34. Attested in my data are a rare feminine form /á=/,
an occurrence of which is displayed in example (226), and a substantially more
frequent non-salientive form /ā=/ (for occurrences of which see (T76), (T144),
and (T154)), which I both identify—tentatively—as inflectional forms of the linker
in view of their syntactic distribution and their apparent function.

that of the non-locative demonstrative roots or the non-locative endophoric
demonstratives (on which see introduction to Section 3.4 and Section 3.4.3, respectively). More specifically, the inflectional forms of the linker unspecified for
nominal tense are likely to be cognate with the medial non-locative demonstrative roots or non-locative endophorics (compare e.g. /yá=/ ‘lk.m’ in the conservative variant of the paradigm of the linker with the medial non-locative demonstrative root /yi ̆-/ ‘med.m’ or the medial non-locative endophoric /yi ̆-má/ ‘med.manaph’; compare, likewise, /yà=/ ‘lk.n/s’ in the conservative variant of the paradigm of the linker with /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ and yi ̂ʼè ‘med.s’ or /yi ̂-mà/ ‘med.n-anaph’
2543. The nominal phrase
‘I go to Lake Tarapoto with them.’ [jgs 106]
The linker in (231) introduces a slightly different type of close apposition of very
common use in smat discourse. In this appositional construction, a NP features as
its first element an independent pronoun that is followed by a nominal constituent
(introduced by the linker) that makes explicit the referent of that pronoun.
(231)̂ à ì ngēmà kōri ̋gǘ.
Nge̋mà, expresogú i ̋nà-g̃ūgüʼ̋ ü̃́ ì nüm

preparing my boat. Then I go to the mouth of the Amacayacu river.] Then
the tourists arrive in express boat.’ [jgs 12]
In many cases, this appositional construction is essentially equivalent, from a semantic and pragmatic perspective, to just mentioning the nominal constituent without its preceding pronoun and, consequently, without the linker (e.g. /[ná-máʼa]
[i ̀=pōʼi ̋]/ [3n/ns-com lk.ns=plantain] = /pōʼi ̋-máʼa/ [plantain-com] ‘with plantains’). When the pronoun in the kind of appositional construction under discussion
is an independent pronoun in the zero-case (i.e. a pronoun in /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’; see
Section 3.3.3), however, expressing a participant via the appositional construction contrasts with mentioning it plainly in that employing the appositional construction explicitly signals that the mention of the participant involves a change
of topic (e.g. /[tü̂-mà] [yá=chô-ʼrǖ pāpa̋]/ [3s-anaph lk.m/s=1sg-gen dad] ‘(as
for) my father’ contrasts with /chô-ʼrǖ pāpa̋/ [1sg-gen dad] ‘my dad’). This is why
the speaker in (231) mentions the tourists—which in the context entail a change
of topic—via the appositional construction (involving the independent pronoun in
the zero-case /nü̂-mà/ [3n/ns-anaph]).
Examples (232–236) essentially illustrate the same use of the linker as (228–231)
above. In (232–236), however, the two parts of the complex NP between which
the linker is establishing an overt link are not syntactically adjacent, but separated by constituents that are not part of that complex NP. I call “scattered
NPs” such NPs interrupted by constituents that do not belong to them syntactically. The linker in (232) introduces a relative clause, just like in (228) above,
2583.5. Linker
except that the NP integrated by the linker in (232) is scattered on both sides of the
predicative phrase.

Example (233) is likewise parallel to (229) above, with a linker also introducing
the head of a NP, except that the NP in (233) is scattered on both sides of the
predicative phrase:

Example (234) features a linker introducing a close apposition in a NP scattered
on both sides of the NP (contrast with (231) above):

Examples (235–236) feature instances of scattered NPs that are not interrupted by a predicative phrase, but by a nominal constituent (note that chîʼè ‘be
bad’ in (235) and pūrākǘ ‘to work’ in (236), although they happen to be verb roots,
occur in these examples as zero-derived nominalizations, which is why they can
be analyzed as nominal constituents). The linker in these two examples introduces
close appositions in constructions of the type pronoun lk=nominal.constituent presented above in the discussion of example (231).

A11]3.5.2.2Linking a nominal constituent to a coreferential indexthat precedes itExamples (237–240) illustrate a function of the linker that is relatively different from the one discussed in the preceding section. In (237–240), the linker does
not link two parts of a complex NP, but a pronominal index that is part of the
inflectional morphology of the predicative phrase, on the one hand, and a
nominal constituent that is coreferential with that index and occurs after the
predicative phrase, on the other hand (this function of the linker was introduced
in the discussion of (225) above). This use of the linker is functionally comparable to its use in the pronoun lk=nominal.constituent close appositional

longer a free form as above, but an index. In (237), two distinct (i.e. non coreferential) nominal constituents occur after the predicative phrase, with each of them
making referentially explicit one of the two pronominal indexes procliticized to the
predicative phrase:
(237)Cha̋ná-g̃ṵ i ̀ chòmà i ̀ gűʼü.̃́
cha̋i =náj =g̃ṵ[i ̀=chò-mà]i[i ̀=gű-ʼü̃́]j1sg.ben=3m/n/ns.sbj=hurt lk.ns=1sg-anaph lk.ns=finish\sbjv-rel.ns‘I regret all of it [lit. ‘It all hurts for me.’].’ [ano1 163]
Example (238) illustrates the same phenomenon (in the second of the two clauses it
comprises), but additionally shows (in its first clause) that the linker is not required
to introduce a nominal constituent that precedes the predicative phrase (in that
case, the nominal constituent is not indexed on the predicative phrase):
(238)Kōpīwāràmàchī tíī-gû. Táyā-gû i ̀ kōpi ̄wāràmàchi ̄.

lk.ns=capybara-meat‘She roasted the capybara meat. She roasted the capybara meat.’ [jsg C146–
147]
Example (239) displays a case where the predicative phrase is a non-verbal one
(on non-verbal predicative phrases in /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, see Section 4.3.3.1) and the
pronominal form it comprises is not an index, but in fact a free pronoun. The
nominal constituent that follows the predicative phrase and makes this free pronoun
referentially explicit bears, as expected, the linker.

In (240), the presence of a linker introducing the nominal constituent can be interpreted as representative of the same function of the linker as a marker establishing
an overt link between a nominal constituent and an index that precedes it. This utterance lacks a predicative phrase altogether, however, and consequently lacks any
2613. The nominal phrase
index that could stand in a relation of coreferentiality with the nominal constituent
that bears the linker. This is because an inflected form of the copular verb i ̃̊ ‘to
be’ (in this case, /ni ́i ̀i =i/̃̊ [3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀=be] ‘it is’), although ellipsed (as is
often the case with this verb root), is virtually present in the utterance. In a
way, in such a configuration, it is the linker that signals where the ellipsed form
of the copular verb (which would necessarily have occurred before the linker) is to
be virtually inserted (in the absence of the linker highlighted in bold in (240), the
whole utterance would be interpreted as an NP meaning ‘that work of mine’).

The linker that introduces the second half of the cleft constructions that
serve for focalization can be interpreted as representing, again, the same use of
the linker as a marker establishing an overt link between a nominal constituent
and an index that precedes it. Instances of such constructions are provided in examples (241–243). In (241), the focalized constituent (/pĕ-nátǖ/ [2pl-father]
‘your father’) has the semantic role of the subject of the predicative phrase
/ü̆-ʼchi ̋rù/ (make-clothes) ‘to clothe’. At a strictly syntactic level, however, that
focalized constituent functions as the complement of the copular verb /ni ́i ̀=i/̃̊
(3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀=be) ‘it is’. What functions as the syntactic subject of the copula is the relative clause chā-üʼ̆ chi ̋rūkǖ tá i ̀ ñṵmá ‘who will clothe me from now
on’. Because that relative clause is coreferential with the subject index /ni ́i ̀=/
‘3m/n/ns.sbj.pci ̀’ in ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ ‘it is’ and occurs after the main predicative phrase, it
has to bear the linker (on focalization implemented by means of cleft constructions
involving relative clauses, see Section 5.2.5, p.420).

In (242–243), because the focalized constituent does not have the semantic role
of the subject or object of the embedded predicative phrase, the second half of
2623.5. Linker
the cleft construction is not a relative clause but a subordinate clause in /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’
(on focalization implemented by means of cleft constructions involving subordinate
clauses in /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’, see Section 5.2.6, p.426). Because that subordinate clause
functions syntactically as the subject of the copular verb and follows it, it bears,
again, the linker.

Note that, just like in (240) above, the copular verb may be ellipsed from focalization constructions. The constituent that virtually occurs “after” the copular
verb, however, retains its linker, although no coreferential index preceding it is in
practice present (see (342) for a case of ellipsis of the copular verb from a focalization construction).","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268]"
"5.2.6Subjunctive Inflectional Type+-ʼü̃́ ‘sub’
(sbjv-ʼü̃́) out of declarative main clausesThis section deals with a particular use of sbjv, namely its extremely frequent
use in association with the subordinator /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’. Unsurprisingly, the combination sbjv-ʼü̃́ occurs in complement and adverbial dependent clauses, and is
involved in cleft constructions that allow for the focalization of constituents that
are neither subjects nor (core) object arguments. More surprisingly, sbjv-ʼü̃́ also
occurs in main clauses as a result of a phenomenon of insubordination.
The function of predicative phrases in sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main clauses is
dealt with in Section 5.2.2 above. All other uses of sbjv-ʼü̃́ are discussed in the
present section.(i) Uses in non-declarative main clauses. In non-declarative main clauses,
sbjv-ʼü̃́ may be used with one of two different functions:

– it is regularly found in utterances involving deontic modality.",[426]

168This chapter deals with smat phonetics and phonology. The language’s segmental underlying units and their realizations are described in Section 2.1. They
compose a relatively small inventory of 11 consonant phonemes (among which
no nasal nor liquid consonants) and 6 vowel phonemes. Only one consonant, the
glottal stop, may occur in coda position, in which case moderately complex rules
determine its surface realization.
Smat’s suprasegmental underlying units are discussed next. Stress, whose occurrence and position are fixed on the first syllable of certain types of morphemes
(verb roots and independent nouns in particular), and whose function can consequently be said not to be contrastive but demarcative, is the topic of Section 2.2.
Nasality, a feature anchored at the level of the syllable, is the topic of Section 2.3.
Smat’s unusually rich toneme inventory, one of the language’s most intriguing
aspects, is dealt with at some length in Section 2.4, from a descriptive perspective
as well as from a cross-linguistic and an areal perspective.
642.1. Segmental inventory
Section 2.5 is dedicated to smat phonotactics, i.e. to the way the underlying units presented in Sections 2.1–2.4 may—or may not—be combined into
syllables.
Section 2.6 describes the major morphophonological phenomena that occur
in the language. Such phenomena obtain both at the segmental and tonological levels in smat. The language’s complex patterns of morphosyntactically-conditioned
tonological alternations, in particular, are covered in detail in this section.
Section 2.7 discusses aspects of smat segmental and suprasegmental phonology that relate to contact situations the language has experienced or is still experiencing with other languages spoken in the Western Amazonian region. This section
explains in particular how tonemes are attributed to borrowed words, and even to
words inserted in a smat context by code-mixing with Spanish, so that such words,
like native smat words, should feature one toneme per underlying syllable.
Section 2.8 briefly explores a few topics in the diachrony of smat’s phonological system.
Finally, Section 2.9 introduces the practical orthography that I employ in the
following chapters of this study for transcribing smat.","[69, 70]"
"5.2.2Indicative Inflectional Type (ind) and
Subjunctive Inflectional Type+-ʼü̃́ ‘sub’
(sbjv-ʼü̃́) in declarative main clausesIn declarative main clauses, ind contrasts with sbjv-ʼü̃́ in a way that is fairly
subtle and hard to capture. The interpretation provided here of the functional distribution of ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́ in this context should be seen as tentative and could
without doubt be improved. Unfortunately, although this interpretation does account for a great majority of their occurrences, it also leaves unexplained a
number of instances of predicative phrases in ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́ in declarative main
clauses in my corpus. Note, additionally, that because this interpretation heavily
relies on discursive factors, it cannot be straightforwardly tested.
As shown in Table 41 above, both ind and sbjv-ʼü̃́ occur in declarative main
clauses. ind can be said to be the default, unmarked Inflectional Type in this
context. Its use is general in any declarative context where the processes referred
to are not felt to require explicit temporal sequencing in order to be correctly interpreted. This implies that ind is found in main clauses in a wide and largely
heterogeneous array of declarative contexts, which will be exemplified below.
In fact, in the speech of some speakers (e.g. igs), ind is pervasive in declarative
main clauses—regardless of the (ir)relevance of explicit temporal sequencing for
their interpretation—and only rarely contrasts with sbjv-ʼü̃́. For these speakers,
3995. Inflection of the predicative phrase
the discussion that follows is mostly irrelevant, and as far as they are concerned
ind can be simply said to be the regular Inflectional Type found in declarative
main clauses of any kind.","[404, 405]"

ti ̀=Table 46. Fusional morphemes encoding both subject index (in slot 4) and predicative
class pci ̄ or pci ̀ in sbjv, contrasted with their expected (but rarely attested or unattested)
concatenative formsnations that affect the last syllable of the predicative phrase remain as unambiguous
phonological exponents of the predicative phrase’s Inflectional Type. Contrast, for
instance, the ind predicative phrase /tā=nā=fè/ (1pl.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=shoot)
‘we shot it’ with its corresponding sbjv form /tā=nā=fʼĕ/ (1pl.sbj(.sbjv)=
3m/n/ns.obj=shoot\sbjv) ‘we killed it’. In practice, the latter only differs from
the former by the effect of sbjv’s morphotonological alternations affecting the last
(and in this case, single) syllable of the predicative phrase (in this case, fè with /21 /
in ind turns into fʼĕ with /CM / in sbjv).
Note that, in sbjv just like in ind (see Section 5.3.2), in cases where a subject
index in slot 4 should immediately precede (i.e. with no intervening morpheme
/yà=/ ‘am’ in slot 5) the predicative class markers /i ̄=/ ‘pci ̄’ or /i ̀=/ ‘pci ̀’ from
slot 6, a phonological reduction of the vowel of the subject index regularly occurs
(see columns pci ̄ and pci ̀ in Chart J on p.452). Because in most cases the resulting
morphemes arise from the fusion of a morpheme in slot 4 that features sbjv’s imposed toneme /1 /, instead of featuring its lexical toneme as in ind, these resulting
morphemes are slightly different from the 4+6 fusional morphemes occurring in
ind. Table 46 provides a list of the 4+6 fusional morphemes as they occur in
sbjv (this table is to be contrasted with Table 43 above, on which it is modeled).
Simpler case 2: a third person subject is expressed as a NP (last row
in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). An additional, easily described complication
occurs in sbjv in cases where a third person subject argument is expressed as a
clause-internal syntactically independent NP that precedes the predicative phrase.
In such contexts, a predicative phrase inflected in ind maintains its indexation of
4405.5. Inflection in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (slots 4–8)
the subject argument in slot 4.270 By contrast, a predicative phrase inflected in
sbjv does not, in such contexts, feature any indexation of the subject argument in slot 4. As a consequence, the toneme /1 / characteristic of sbjv cannot
be imposed to a proclitic belonging in slot 4 (in the absence of any such morpheme). In this situation, sbjv’s toneme /1 / is simply not realized, and the
combinations of proclitics that obtain are identical to those found in ind, except
that they lack any material in slot 4 (note that in practice, this makes the combinations of proclitics that occur in sbjv in this specific situation identical for the
most part to those found in imp, which are likewise mostly identical to those found
in ind except that they lack any material in slot 4; see the preceding section).
The morphotonological alternations that affect the last syllable of the predicative
phrase in sbjv maintain, for their part, their usual effect. Contrast, for instance, the
clause in ind /Juan ná=pé/ (John 3m/n/ns.sbj=sleep) ‘John slept’ with the corresponding clause in sbjv /Juan pê/ (John sleep\sbjv) ‘(that) John slept’. While
the predicative phrase in the former clause obligatorily indexes the subject argument already expressed as a NP preceding it, no such indexation occurs within the
predicative phrase of the latter clause. The predicative phrase in sbjv additionally features the effect of sbjv’s morphotonological alternations (with pé in ind
→ pê in sbjv). Contrast, likewise, the clause in ind /Juan ná=yà=ma̰/ (John
3m/n/ns.sbj=pci ̀.3m/n/ns.obj=kill.sg) ‘John killed it’ with the corresponding
clause in sbjv /Juan yà=ma̋/ (John pci ̀.3m/n/ns.obj=kill.sg\sbjv) ‘(that) John
killed it’.
Much more intricate complications occur in sbjv in cases where a third
person feminine/masculine/neuter/non-salientive (f/m/n/ns) subject argument (not expressed within the clause as a NP preceding the predicative phrase)
or a fourth person argument are to be indexed on the predicative phrase. These
complications arise from the fact that slot 4 in sbjv does not feature indexes
for such subjects (while it does feature indexes for them in ind). The indexation
of such subjects therefore has to operate via other strategies than straightforward
encoding in slot 4.271
This process of “indexation” could in fact be better characterized as a case of agreement for
subject argument, given that it indexes a participant already expressed syntactically in the clause.
270Interestingly, certain speakers (e.g. jgs, lar, igv) occasionally produce analogical forms in
sbjv with a third person f/m/n/ns subject index that aligns with the straightforward cases of encoding of subject indexes in slot 4 in sbjv discussed in the preceding paragraphs, e.g. /nà4 =rǖ6 =ngǜgü̋-ʼǘ̃/ (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest-pl\sbjv-sub) ‘they rested’ (on the model of the straightforward /tà4 =rǖ6 =ngǜ-gü̋-ʼü̃́/ [3s.sbj\sbjv=pcrǖ=rest-pl\sbjv-sub] ‘they rested’) instead of the
2714415. Inflection of the predicative phrase
The strategies employed for indexing a third person f/m/n/ns subject in sbjv
differ from those employed for encoding a fourth person subject.
Complex case 1: indexation of a third person subject in slot 7 (fifth
and sixth rows in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). Third person f/m/n/ns
subjects in sbjv are encoded in slot 7, i.e. in the slot dedicated to the encoding of
third person m/n/ns (core) objects in ind, and their exponents are segmentally
(but not always tonologically) identical to those that encode third person
m/n/ns objects in ind.272 In other words, the morphological material occurring
in slot 7 in ind, although it happens to only serve for the encoding of third person m/n/ns object indexes in ind (given that subjects are always indexed in slot 4
in ind),273 essentially encodes a third person f/m/n/ns index, whether subject or
object, which is why the exact same material is found to occur in sbjv for the encoding of third person f/m/n/ns subject indexes. Portmanteau proclitics in sbjv
that simultaneously encode a third person f/m/n/ns subject index in slot 7 together
with features from slots 5 (associated motion) or 6 (predicative class) are likewise
segmentally (but not always tonologically) identical to those that simultaneously
encode in ind a third person m/n/ns object index in slot 7 together with features
from slots 5 or 6. The reason why all these morphemes encoding a f/m/n/ns subregular but more opaque /nà6+7 =ngǜ-gü̋-ʼü̃́/ [pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=rest-pl\sbjv-sub] ‘they
rested’ (subscript numbers in these forms correspond to the slots filled by the respective morphemes;
for an instance of this phenomenon in context, see (T109)). I take such analogical forms as an indication that the system of encoding of third person f/m/n/ns subject indexes in sbjv proves opaque
to speakers themselves, to the point of prompting unconscious “repairs” from them.
This formal identity suffers a single exception. While the morpheme that simultaneously encodes pci ̀ and a third person m/n/ns object index in ind has the phonological form /yà=/, the
one that simultaneously encodes pci ̀ and a third person f/m/n/ns subject index in sbjv virtually
always takes the phonological form /yi ̀=/ (or even /yi ̰=/, instead of the expected /yà=/) in the
specific case where it is combined with the high-frequency verb root i ̃̊ ‘to be’ (yielding the predicative phrase /yi ̀=i/̃̀ [pci ̀.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv=be\sbjv] ‘(that) he/she/it is’). For a similar case of
assimilation for vowel quality of an /a/ with the nucleus /i/ of i ̃̊ ‘to be’, see the case of the irregular
realization /i ̄yi ̀=/ of the proclitic /i ̄yà=/ ‘3f.sbj.pci ̀’ in Section 5.3.2.
272Note, additionally, that the reason why the morphemes that fill slot 7 in ind never stand for
a third person f object but only for third person m/n/ns objects (while the same morphemes in
ind may stand for both third person m/n/ns and f subjects) is because third person f participants
in (core) object syntactic position are in practice always encoded, via a phenomenon of differential
object marking, as participants in the accusative. Such participants, when indexed on the predicative
phrase, systematically occupy slot 2 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase, and never
slot 7.
2734425.5. Inflection in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (slots 4–8)
ject index in slot 7 (potentially along with other features from slots 5 or 6) in sbjv
are not always tonologically identical (although they are segmentally) with those
that encode a m/n/ns object index in slot 7 (again, potentially along with other
features) in ind, is that they undergo the imposition of sbjv’s characteristic
toneme /1 / in cases where the third person subject index being encoded corresponds to a m/n/ns participant (by contrast with a f participant). However,
sbjv’s toneme /1 / is not imposed to these morphemes in cases where the third person subject index being encoded corresponds to a f participant, which is how a third
person m/n/ns subject index may be distinguished from a third person f subject
index.
Examples (503–505) illustrate what was just said in the preceding paragraph
(the subscript numbers to the right of the morphemes in these examples correspond
to the slots of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase that the respective
morphemes fill). Example (503) shows that the same form /nā=/ in slot 7 that
serves for the encoding of a third person m/n/ns object in ind (as in (503a), where
it is glossed as ‘3m/n/ns.obj’) may serve in sbjv for the encoding of a third person
f subject, with no tonological modification (as in (503b), where it is glossed as
‘3f.sbj.sbjv’). The same morpheme, if affected by sbjv’s toneme imposition of
/1 /, may serve in sbjv for the encoding of a third person m/n/ns subject (as in
(503c), where it is glossed as ‘3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv’).
(503)a. chā4 =nā7 =ngo̰1sg.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=bite‘I bit it’b. nā7 =pê3f.sbj.sbjv=sleep\sbjv‘(that) she slept’c. nà7 =pê3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=sleep\sbjv‘(that) he slept’Example (504) similarly shows that the same form /yà=/ in slots 5+7 that contributes the encoding of a third person m/n/ns object in ind (as in (504a), where it
is glossed as ‘am.3m/n/ns.obj’) may contribute in sbjv the encoding of a third person f/m/n/ns subject (as in (504b), where it is glossed as ‘am.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv’).
Note that in this case, by contrast with the case just discussed in the preceding example, because the form /yà=/ already features a lexical toneme /1 /, the encodings
of a third person f vs a third person m/n/ns subject index cannot be distinguished
4435. Inflection of the predicative phrase
by the imposition of sbjv’s toneme /1 / for the encoding of the latter.
(504)a. chā4 =yà5+7 =ngo̰1sg.sbj=am.3m/n/ns.obj=bite‘I went and bit it’b. yà5+7 =pêam.3f/m/n/ns.sbj.sbjv=sleep\sbjv‘(that) she/he slept’Example (505) shows an additional case of the same phenomenon. The form /nā=/
in slots 6+7, which contributes the encoding of a third person m/n/ns object in
ind (as in (505a)), may contribute in sbjv the encoding of a third person f subject
index (as in (505b), where the form’s toneme is left unchanged) or a third person
m/n/ns subject index (as in (505c), where the form is imposed sbjv’s toneme /1 /).
(505)a. chā4 =yà5 =nā6+7 =ngǜ-ʼẽʼ́ e1sg.sbj=am=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.obj=rest-caus‘I went and made him rest’
b. yà5 =nā6+7 =ngʼü̆am=pcrǖ.3f.sbj.sbjv=rest\sbjv‘(that) she went and rested’
c. yà5 =nà6+7 =ngʼü̆am=pcrǖ.3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=rest\sbjv‘(that) he went and rested’Incidentally, the indexation of a f/m/n/ns subject in sbjv, because it occupies
slot 7, forces the indexation of third person m/n/ns objects (when present)
out of slot 7 (see fifth and sixth rows in Charts K and M on pp.452–453). From a
functional perspective, this can be said to be the reason why the inflectional template of the predicative phrase in sbjv features an extra slot 8 (at the right edge
of the predicative phrase) compared to the inflectional templates of the predicative
phrase in ind or imp. The only function of this extra slot 8 is to encode a third person m/n/ns object index (by means of a suffix /-ã/̀ ‘3m/n/ns.obj’) in cases where
slot 7 is already filled by the encoding of a third person f/m/n/ns subject (note that
whenever slot 7 is available, however, the indexation of a third person m/n/ns object in sbjv operates, by default, in slot 7). Contrast, for instance, the ind predicative phrase /ná4 =nā7 =ngo̰/ (3m/n/ns.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=bite) ‘he ate it’ with
its corresponding sbjv predicative phrase /nà7 =ngő-ã̀8 / (3m/n/ns.sbj\sbjv=
bite\sbjv-3m/n/ns.obj) ‘(that) he ate it’. Because in the sbjv predicative phrase
4445.5. Inflection in the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (slots 4–8)
slot 7 is occupied by the indexation of a third person m/n/ns subject, the third person m/n/ns object index encoded in slot 7 in the ind predicative phrase is forced
out of it into slot 8 in the sbjv predicative phrase.
Complex case 2: “negative indexation” of a fourth person subject
(second-to-last row in Charts J–M on pp.452–453). Fourth person subjects in sbjv can be said to be encoded negatively. It is the absence of any subject
marking in slots 4 or 7, combined with the absence of any NP in subject position preceding the predicative phrase, that is interpreted as implying that the predicative
phrase has a fourth person subject. Fourth person subjects in sbjv are represented morphologically—so to say—as an absence of subject. When “indexation” of a fourth person subject occurs in sbjv, the last of the proclitics that
precede the predicative phrase is systematically imposed sbjv’s toneme /1 /
(which may, as in other cases discussed in this section, result in no change if the
last proclitic’s lexical toneme, i.e. the one it features in ind, is already /1 /).
Contrast the predicative phrase in ind /ti ́i ̄=déʼà-gǘ/ (4sbj.pci ̄=speak-pl) ‘we
(incl.) spoke’ (with /ti ́i ̄=/ < /tá=i ̄=/ ‘4sbj=pci ̄=’; see Table 43) with the
corresponding predicative phrase in sbjv /i ̀=déʼà-gü̋/ (pci ̄\sbjv=speak-pl\sbjv)
‘(that) we (incl.) spoke’. The latter differs from the former in that it completely
lacks—from a formal perspective—a subject, and in that its last (and only) proclitic
(/i ̀=/ ‘pci ̄\sbjv’) features sbjv’s imposed toneme /1 / (by contrast with /i ̄=/ ‘pci ̄’
in the ind predicative phrase, which features its lexical toneme /3 /). Contrast, likewise, the predicative phrase in ind /tá=yà=rǖ=ngǜ-gǘ/ (4sbj=am=pcrǖ=restpl) ‘we (incl.) went and rested’ with the corresponding predicative phrase in sbjv
/yà=rǜ=ngǜ-gü̋/ (am=pcrǖ\sbjv=rest-pl\sbjv) ‘(that) we (incl.) went and
rested’. Again, the latter differs from the former in that it completely lacks a subject,
and in that the last morpheme in its chain of proclitics (/rǜ=/ ‘pcrǖ\sbjv’) features
sbjv’s imposed toneme /1 / (by contrast with /rǖ=/ ‘pcrǖ’ in the ind predicative
phrase, which features its lexical toneme /3 /). Finally, contrast in the same way
the predicative phrase in ind /tá=yà=pé-gǘ/ (4sbj=am=sleep-pl) ‘we (incl.)
went and slept’ with the corresponding predicative phrase in sbjv /yà=pé-gü̋/
(am.sbjv=sleep-pl\sbjv) ‘(that) we (incl.) went and slept’. Note, in this last example, that the form /yà=/, which already features a lexical toneme /1 /, remains
tonologically unchanged from the ind predicative phrase to the sbjv predicative
phrase.
Note, finally, an exception that occurs in pcØ predicative phrases in sbjv with a
fourth person subject, in cases where neither associated motion nor a third person

m/n/ns object index are encoded within the predicative phrase (see second-to-last
row of the first column of Chart J on p.452). Given an ind predicative phrase
/tá=pé-gǘ/ (4sbj=sleep-pl) ‘we (incl.) slept’, one might expect its corresponding
sbjv predicative phrase to be */pé-gü̋/, i.e. to lack any proclitic, as per the principles put forward in the preceding paragraph. In this specific situation, however,
and probably so as to avoid the complete lack of inflectional marking in the predicative phrase, an ad hoc pcØ marker /i ̀=/ ‘pcø.sbjv’ “fills” the lack of proclitics, yielding in this case a sbjv predicative phrase /i ̀=pé-gü̋/ (pcø.sbjv=sleeppl\sbjv) ‘(that) we (incl.) slept’ (for a similar case of “filler” pcØ marker occurring
in the inflectional morphology of imp, see the discussion of /nà=/ ‘pcø.imp’ in
Section 5.4). The form of this morpheme might indicate that it represents historically an extension of the regular predicative class markers /i ̄=/ and /i ̀=/ of pci ̄
and pci ̀ respectively (which both acquire the form /i ̀=/ under the effect of sbjv’s
toneme /1 / imposition) into the inflectional morphology of pcØ.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451]"
"4115. Inflection of the predicative phrase5.2.3Indicative Inflectional Type (ind) out of
declarative main clauses(i) Uses in non-declarative main clauses. In non-declarative main
clauses, ind may be used with one of three different functions (on ind in declarative
main clauses, see the preceding section):
– it is found in polar interrogative utterances (in apparent free variation with
sbjv-ʼü̃́, see Section 5.2.6 below);
– it is regularly found in content interrogative utterances;
– it is commonly found in constructional association with ngi ̏ʼā ‘let’s go’ in (positive) exhortative utterances with a 4th person subject (bare sbjv is also
occasionally found in this context, see Section 5.2.5 below).
As shown in examples (458) and (459), ind occurs in interrogative utterances,
whether polar questions (as in (458)) or content questions (as in (459)). I have
not been able to detect any significant semantic or pragmatic distribution between
the use of ind and the equally frequent use of sbjv-ʼü̃́ in polar interrogative utterances.

‘“Let’s sing!”’ [jsg B332]
(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. The use of ind is systematic in explicative
dependent clauses in ērǘ ‘because’ or ye̊rǘ ‘because.pst’. This use is illustrated
in the following example:

in main clauses for the expression of second person singular positive imperatives, as in the following two examples (see also (448b) above):

different functions:
– encoding of a general positive directive meaning;
4135. Inflection of the predicative phrase
– expression of assertion (in combination with the morphemes /=na̋/ ‘assert’
or ta̋ ‘assert.expl’).
The directive meaning of bare sbjv in main clauses is compatible with any
person value of the subject. It is found with first and fourth person subjects with
an exhortative meaning (as in examples (464–465)), with second person subjects
with an imperative meaning (as in (466)), and with third person subjects with a
jussive meaning (as in (467)).

4145.2. Functional distribution of the Inflectional Types
Of these associations, the one involving bare sbjv and second person plural
subjects (as in (466)) is probably the most common, given that it is apparently
the regular way to express a second person plural positive imperative. Bare sbjv
in main clauses seems to be much less likely to occur with subjects in other personnumber-nominal class combinations (as in (464–465) and (467)), at least in younger
speakers, who in such contexts typically replace bare sbjv with ind (case of a fourth
person subject, see Section 5.2.3 above) or with sbjv-ʼü̃́ in its deontic function
(case of a first or third person subject, see Section 5.2.6 below; see example (467)
for a case of vacillation between the use of bare sbjv and sbjv-ʼü̃́ for the expression
of a jussive meaning).
A rare use of bare sbjv in main clauses, which is likely derived from its general
directive meaning, is found in the expression of wishes and curses, as in examples
(468–469). These interpretations of bare sbjv likely rely on the constructional cooccurrence of other markers associated to them, such as ñȍʼkǜ ‘soon; if only …’ (in
wishes) or /tá=tà/ ‘fut?=add?’ (in curses).

Bare sbjv is also used in the expression of assertion, i.e. the expression of information that the speaker thinks does not, or may not, match with the assumptions
of the addressee or a third party (‘you know, …’, ‘this might not be what you/they
think, but …’). With this function, bare sbjv obligatorily co-occurs with the second position clitic /=na̋/ ‘assert’, as in example (470),263 or the utterance-initial
particle ta̋ ‘assert.expl’, as in (471). These two assertion markers have slightly

different meanings, with /=na̋/ being of more general use and ta̋ typically being
associated with the assertion of an explanation provided to account for some other
information present in the context.

23]
(ii) Uses in dependent clauses. Apart from main clauses, bare sbjv is found
in two major kinds of dependent clauses:
– it is regularly found in circumstantial adverbial clauses in /...-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’
(‘when/if ...’), /...-ya̽ne̋/ ‘simult.circ’ (‘while ...’), rǜ … ‘and’ (‘while ...’),264

¡Cómetelo tú! que a mí no me gusta.). These normally feature a predicative phrase in ind, not sbjv,
as in the following example:
264(i) “Áh, mêà rǜ chāpē-chîʼèwē!”
chā=pē=chîʼè-wē

̀ ǜ/ ‘man’ (‘in this
/ñṵmá=tà …/ ‘present.time=add’ (‘until ...’), and /...-ãk
or that manner’);
– it is found in the rare polar interrogative complement clauses in na̋ …
‘assert’ or rǜ … ‘and’ (‘whether …’) and command complement clauses in
rǜ … ‘and’ (‘(tell) to …’).
The various uses of bare sbjv in circumstantial adverbial clauses are illustrated in examples (472–477). The use of bare sbjv in association with /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’
in its temporal meaning ‘when ...’ is exemplified in example (472). Its use with
/-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’ in its hypothetical meaning ‘if ...’ is exemplified in (473). Its use with
/-ya̽ne̋/ ‘simult.circ’ (‘while ...’) is exemplified in (474). Its use with rǜ … ‘and’
(‘while ...’) is exemplified in (475). Its use with /ñṵmá=tà/ ‘present.time=add’
̀ ǜ/ ‘man’ (‘in this or
(‘until ...’) is exemplified in (476). Finally, its use with /-ãk
that manner’) is exemplified in (477).

exemplified regularly require the constructional co-occurrence of other markers for
their correct interpretation, the following example from my corpus features a case
of bare sbjv circumstantial adverbial clause with no other marking than the
use of bare sbjv itself:

ear, with whom I transcribed the text from which this utterance was extracted,
confirmed to me that it was perfectly acceptable as it stands, although the same
meaning could have been alternatively expressed with a rǜ + bare sbjv (‘while
…’) dependent clause. It thus seems that bare sbjv can function on its own as an
Inflectional Type specialized in the expression of circumstantial adverbial clauses.
Examples (479) and (480) illustrate the use of bare sbjv in polar interrogative and command complement clauses respectively. These two examples were
elicited. My corpus does not contain any instances of these rare, but apparently
natural-sounding, constructions.

(iii) Uses not related to clause type. The use of bare sbjv is obligatory in
relative clauses. The predicative phrase in bare sbjv then bears the relativizer suffix, which agrees in nominal class with the pivot (featuring the forms /-kǖ/ ‘rel.f’,
/-kǖ/ ‘rel.m’, /-(ʼǘ̃)nè/ ‘rel.n’, /-ʼè/ ‘rel.s’, and /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘rel.ns’), as illustrated in
the following examples:

Relative clauses are involved as components of the cleft sentences that constitute the strategy used for focalizing subject and (core) object arguments (on
the strategy employed for focalizing other constituents, see Section 5.2.6 below).
Example (484), in which the subject âi ‘wild felid’ is focalized, is to be compared
with the semantically equivalent plain sentence /Âi pē=tàʼkú-ē-ʼẽʼ́ e./ (wild.felid
2pl.acc=be.an.orphan-intr.pl-caus) ‘A jaguar has orphaned you.’.

Focalization of interrogative constituents in any syntactic function is optional
but frequent in content interrogative utterances, as shown in example (485) (see
also (502) and end of Section 5.2.6 below). In practice, interrogative utterances
featuring such focalization of the interrogative constituent do not seem to contrast
in any significant way from corresponding utterances featuring no focalization, as
in e.g. (459) above.

subordinate clauses in /-ʼǘ̃/ are extremely frequent and occur in a wide array of

declarative main clauses) and in the next section (other uses).","[416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426]"

[jsg C46–47]3.5.2.6Linker used as a type of definite determinerAnother case where the linker’s function is not to link the nominal constituent to
which it is procliticized to any preceding coreferential nominal constituent or index
is when it serves as a particular type of definite determiner used to signal that a
nominal constituent is intended to allow for the identification of a particular
referent within a set of referents already established as a main topic (implying
a contrast between that particular referent and the other referents in the set of
referents in question). This function of the linker is extremely reminiscent of the
use of the non-locative endophorics as a type of definite determiners (on which see
Section 3.4.3, p.225). In this function, the linker often marks a headless relative
clause, as in (254–255), or minimally a NP modified by a relative clause. It may
also mark a NP that does not contain any relative clause, as in (256).

tentatively analyze as the linker in its past non-salientive inflectional form.
This morpheme is procliticized to apparently any type of subordinate clauses
to indicate that they refer to past processes. Example (257) shows this morpheme /gá=/ procliticized to a circumstantial adverbial clause in /-ʼgu̽/ ‘circ’.
Examples (258–259) show it procliticized to complement clauses introduced by the
conjunction náʼa ∼ ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ (náʼa and ni ́i ̀-i ̃̊ are two subdialectal variants of the same
conjunction; note that intriguingly, although these two variants generally have the2683.5. Linker
exact same distribution, they do not occur in the same order relative to the morpheme /gá=/ under discussion in this section, yielding /gá=náʼa .../ but /ni ́i ̀.i ̃̊

Importantly, the non-past non-salientive inflectional form of the linker
(/i ̀=/) never occurs in front of subordinate clauses that do not refer to past
processes (or, minimally, that are not explicitly marked as referring to past processes).225 Such subordinate clauses, regardless of whether they are coreferential
Except in cases where a subordinate clause in /-ʼü̃́/ ‘sub’ occurs in a cleft construction serving
for focalization, as in example (242) above. In this specific case, the subordinate clause does indeed
bear the form /i ̀=/ ‘lk.ns’ of the linker if the main clause refers to non-past (or not explicitly past)
processes.
2252693. The nominal phrase
or not with a preceding nominal constituent or index, regularly occur with no morpheme of any sort filling the syntactic position that would be occupied by /gá=/ if
they were to be marked as referring to past processes. This observation is illustrated
in the following example:
(260)Mā nǖkù-fa̋ʼü̃́ náʼa åkǘ nà-trataʼü̃́ i ̀ ñåà?

this is about, now?’ [jsg C168]
This observation questions whether the morpheme /gá=/ that marks subordinate clauses referring to past processes actually is to be analyzed as a
form of the linker. Analyzing it that way implies considering that the linker exhibits a defective distribution in its occurrences on subordinate clauses. Such an
analysis further implies to consider a syntactic constituent such as chà-bûʼgù ‘when I
was young’ in (257) as the syntactic equivalent of a nominal constituent, given that
the linker, in all of its other uses, can only be procliticized to nominal constituents.
Although the marker /gá=/ of subordinate clauses referring to past processes is
most likely cognate with the linker, it might in fact be better analyzed, from a synchronic perspective, as a separate morpheme rather than as an inflectional form of
the linker.","[271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"

As is to be expected, an example such as (154) shows that not just any social
group with which the speaker identifies may be referred to as a fourth person
participant, but only culturally highly relevant ones, i.e. ones that best define one’s
identity, and in particular ethnicity and race as in the preceding examples. In this
example and the stretches of discourse that precede and follow it, the speaker is
comparing the working conditions of tourist guides, being one himself, with those
of other members of the community who work at a construction site. The two social
groups thus defined by the speaker are certainly not relevant and stable enough for
him to refer to the one he belongs to as an in-groups fourth person participant
(contrast (154) with (152) above, where in comparing two ethnic or racial groups
the speaker refers to the one she identifies with as a fourth person participant).

Importantly, I was the only hearer present when (150–152) were uttered. The
fact that I am neither a Tikuna nor an Indigenous South American shows that the
in-groups fourth person does not have to include the hearer among its referents, which makes it significantly distinct semantically from first person plural
inclusive uses of the fourth person. Note also that in examples (150) through (153),
uses of the fourth person, however vague, are referential inasmuch as they do
point to identifiable individuals in the real world. This, in its turn, makes the ingroups use of the fourth person significantly distinct semantically from its generic
use exemplified next.
2103.4. Non-locative demonstratives
Examples (155–156) illustrate the generic use of the fourth person (see also
(T116–T119)). This use largely overlaps functionally with the generic use of the
second person singular (compare (144) above). Note that in the free English translations provided for these examples, the fourth person, which could be more literally
translated as ‘one’, is rendered as a second person singular (‘you’).

3.4.1Non-locative demonstratives
Introduction to the demonstratives in smatsmat features two major classes of nominal demonstratives, which I call nonlocative demonstratives and locative demonstratives, respectively (the roots
on which these are based are displayed in Tables 30 and 31 and commented upon
below).
2113. The nominal phrase
The non-locative demonstrative roots are displayed in Table 30 with all of their
basic inflectional forms (where two allomorphs are listed, the second one occurs
specifically when suffixed with /-ma̽/ ‘anaph’; items in parentheses are only marginally attested). The two series of locative demonstrative roots are listed in Table 31 for reference. The morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the
words that may be derived from the non-locative demonstrative roots are discussed
individually in the following sections. Note that the uses of the locative demonstrative roots and the words that may be derived from them are not covered in this
grammatical description. The following paragraphs introduce a few preliminary
observations as to the general organization of the system of smat demonstratives.
As suggested in Tables 30 and 31, the demonstratives, whether non-locative
or locative, are organized along an axis of three grammatical degrees of “distance” that I label “proximal” (prox), “medial” (med), and “distal” (dist). Both
the non-locative and the locative demonstrative roots may enter in the formation of
demonstrative words with exophoric as well as endophoric reference. Endophoric
demonstratives essentially refer to elements that are part of the linguistic context
of a speech act (as in examples (158) and (161) above), while exophoric demonstratives refer to elements that are part of the non-linguistic context, e.g. real-world
entities that are part of the physical environment where the speech act occurs (as in
(157) and (159) above). In cases where the demonstrative roots are employed for
exophoric reference (i.e., in most cases, when they are suffixed with /-à/ ‘exo’),
the three degrees of distance generally correspond, rather straightforwardly, to
three ranges of physical distance. They are specifically used to convey—broadly
speaking—that the referent is within reach (prox; this and here), out of reach but at
a short distance (med; that and there), or out of reach and at a longer distance (dist;
that over there and over there) relative to the deictic center (which, in a majority of
cases, corresponds to the speaker).
The respective functions of the three degrees of distance are less straightforward
in cases where the demonstrative roots are employed for endophoric reference
(i.e., in most cases, when they are suffixed with /-ma̽/ ‘exo’). Briefly, the medial demonstratives can be characterized as the default forms for anaphoric
(and possibly cataphoric) reference, whether the referent is a participant or a
propositional content. For anaphoric reference in pre-hodiernal past contexts (i.e.
contexts referring to a past that precedes today), older speakers usually—but not
obligatorily—use the distal demonstratives instead of the medial demonstratives.
Younger speakers, however, tend to generalize the medial demonstratives regard2143.4. Non-locative demonstratives
less of the temporal setting (pre-hodiernal past or non-pre-hodiernal-past) of the
processes referred to. In most of their occurrences, the proximal demonstratives
roots, when used in the same morphosyntactic contexts where the medial and distal
demonstrative roots fulfill endophoric functions, do not involve endophoric reference strictly speaking, but point symbolically at temporal or spatial referents that
partially coincide with the temporal or spatial setting of the utterance act itself (in
phrases with meanings such as ‘this year [in which you and me are talking]’, ‘this
house [where you and me are right now]’, or ‘here [where you and me are right
now]’). Occurrences of the proximal demonstrative roots in such contexts are in
practice rare in spontaneous speech. The widely diverging semantic and pragmatic
uses of the three-fold distance dimension of the paradigms of demonstrative roots,
depending on whether they are employed for exophoric or endophoric reference,
are discussed and exemplified in the following sections.
Note, additionally, that the non-locative demonstrative roots are among the
forms that inflect for nominal class (simultaneously involving within a single
paradigm cases of tonological inflection, as in /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ vs /yi ̆-/ ‘med.m’, suppletive inflection, as in /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ vs /ngē-/ ‘med.ns’, and inflection through
the addition of segmental material, as in /yi ̂-/ ‘med.n’ vs /yi ̂ʼè/ ‘med.s’205 ). They
obligatorily agree with the participant they relate to, whether the latter is syntactically present (as a head in cases where a demonstrative is used as a modifier; see
example (159)) or not (cases where a demonstrative constitutes a complete NP on
its own and the participant it relates to is to be understood contextually; see (160)).
Interestingly, alongside a default salientive form unspecified for number (column s
in Table 30), the non-locative demonstratives feature an (infrequently occurring)
specific inflectional form employed to refer to explicitly plural referents assigned to
the salientive nominal class (column s.pl). Such specifically plural non-salientive
forms are almost unattested in the paradigms of other forms inflecting for nominal
class in the language. Most forms of the non-locative demonstrative roots (with the
exception of the default salientive forms) cannot stand on their own in discourse
and only occur with additional morphology.
The syllables /-ʼè/ and /-ã/̰ or /-ã/̀ in the default salientive and specifically plural salientive
forms of the non-locative demonstrative roots (columns s and s.pl in Table 30) are most likely
cognate with the homonymous default salientive and specifically plural salientive forms of the relativizer. Although best considered as unanalyzable from a synchronic perspective, the salientive
forms of the demonstrative roots, by contrast to their other inflectional forms, thus seem to be relatively easily analyzable from a diachronic perspective as the agglutinative association of a demonstrative morpheme with a morpheme encoding (perhaps alongside other features) nominal class.
2052153. The nominal phrase
The locative demonstratives, for their part, exist in two series. These mostly
correspond to forms that may directly commute (i.e. without additional marking)
with a NP bearing the areal locative relational noun /-wa̋/ on the one hand (such
as the first demonstrative in example (158)), and forms that may commute with a
NP bearing the punctual locative relational noun /-gu̽/ on the other (such as the
second demonstrative in (158)). On the functions of the relational nouns /-wa̋/
‘aloc’ and /-gu̽/ ‘ploc’, see Section 3.6.2.
The non-locative demonstratives and a few other forms morphologically related to them are discussed and exemplified at length in the following sections. Note
that smat additionally features a demonstrative verb, the irregular bipartite verb
/ña̋-/ñâ-+-((rǖ)gǜ)/ ‘do thus’, whose first morphological component /ña̋-/ñâ-/ is
likely cognate with the non-salientive and feminine allomorphs (/ñå-/ and /ñá-/
respectively) of the proximal demonstrative root. The demonstrative verb is dealt
with separately in Chapter 6.
For a fine-grained semantic and pragmatic study of the non-locative and
locative demonstratives in the Cushillococha variety of Tikuna, and of the exact
values of the three grammatical degrees of distance mentioned above in particular,

"5.6Summary: charts of combinations found in
slots 4–8 of the inflectional template of the
predicative phraseBelow (Charts A–M, pp. 449–453) are exhaustive charts of the morphological combinations found in slots 4–8 of the inflectional template of the
predicative phrase. Although these charts should be essentially predictable by
application of the morphological rules exposed in Sections 5.3 through 5.5 above,
they should usefully provide a fully explicit exposition of the outcomes of these
relatively complex morphological rules. Note that slots 1–3 of the inflectional template of the predicative phrase are not considered here as they present no particular
morphological difficulties in their combinations both between themselves and with
morphemes from slots 4–8 (for a list of the morphemes occurring in slots 1–3, see
Table 39, p.393).
The charts in this section are arranged, at a first level, by Inflectional Type.
The Indicative Inflectional Type (ind) is exposed in Charts A–D, the Imperative Inflectional Type (imp) in Charts E–H, and the Subjunctive Inflectional Type (sbjv)
in Charts J–M.274

Within each of these three sections, the charts are, at a second level, arranged
according to the combination they correspond to among the four possible combinations of the following two parameters:
– absence vs presence of encoding of associated motion (slot 5) in the inflected predicative phrase ([-am] vs [+am]);
– absence vs presence of indexation of a third person masculine/neuter/
non-salientive (core) object argument (slots 7 or 8) in the inflected predicative phrase ([-3m/n/ns.obj] vs [+3m/n/ns.obj]).
Within each particular chart, forms are arranged horizontally according to the
predicative class whose inflectional morphological combinations they illustrate
(pcØ, pci ̄, pci ̀, pcrǖ; forms belonging to the poorly attested pcnà are not included).
Forms are further arranged vertically according to the particular personnumber-nominal class combination that is encoded by their subject index.
The subject person-number-nominal class combinations 2sg.sbj in imp and 4sbj in
sbjv are not—strictly speaking—indexed, which is why they are in parentheses in
the corresponding charts. In these two particular cases, it is in fact the absence of a
subject exponent in the inflected predicative phrase that guides the interpretation
of the person of the subject. The bottom row labeled ‘Explicit NP’ in Charts J–M
refers to the specific situation, only occurring in sbjv, where no subject is indexed
in the inflected predicative phrase because the subject is expressed within the clause
as an explicit syntactic NP preceding the inflected predicative phrase.
Seven of the eight predicative phrases used here for illustration (in light grey
in the charts) are verb roots. These are the intransitive verb roots pé ‘to sleep’
(lexically a pcØ verb root), déʼà ‘to speak’ (lexically pci ̄), yûʼu ‘to jump’ (a verb
root often encountered inflected in pci ̀, although it belongs lexically to pcØ), and
ngǜ ‘to rest’ (lexically pcrǖ), and the transitive verb roots ngo̰ ‘to eat’ (lexically
pcØ), yâʼu ‘to seize’ (lexically pci ̄), and ma̰ ‘to kill (sg.)’ (lexically pci ̀). The eighth
predicative phrase used in the charts, the transitive predicative phrase /ngǜ-ʼẽʼ́ e/
‘to make rest’ (lexically pcrǖ), is derived from ngǜ ‘to rest’ (lexically pcrǖ) by means
of the causative suffix /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’, which has no effect on the predicative class of
Charts E–H correspond to forms in bare sbjv—i.e. not sbjv-ʼü̃́—that are further not associated

of the predicative phrases themselves may be different in sbjv forms associated with relativizers,

"4.2.4.2/-tā/ ‘closed’The derivational suffix of the verb root /-tā/ ‘closed’ only occurs on transitive
verb roots in my data and is poorly attested in my corpus. Its semantic contribution is to indicate that the process denoted by the verb root and performed on the
object referent (which at the initial phase of the process does not feature continuous boundaries) causes that referent to come to feature continuous boundaries
tightly separating a portion of space. In other words, in indicates that the process
results in the object referent becoming closed (three-dimensional entity), no longer
perforated (two-dimensional entity, such as a wall), or fastened (linear entity, such
as a belt). This suffix, which could be said to denote a [+sealed] feature, is the
positive counterpart of /-na̽/ ‘open’ (on which see next section). Illustrations of the
use of this suffix are provided in examples (316) and (317).

(i) /-té/ ‘apart’. This suffix, which is only attested on transitive verb roots in my
data, indicates that the process results in the splitting into parts of the referent
corresponding to the object:
(321)a. tô-téb. wài-téfetch-apart
cut-apart‘to partition’‘to cut in halves’This suffix is homonymous with the bound noun -té ‘husband’, with which it
might have—very hypothetically—a semantically non-straightforward cognacy relationship (based, perhaps, on the conception that somebody’s husband is a portion
of them).
(ii) /-né/ ‘repeatedly?’. The meaning of this suffix is possibly related to the notion of repetition. In most cases, it co-occurs with the suffix /-kǘʼü/ ‘intens.iter’,
as in (322a–322b) (on /-kǘʼü/, see Section 4.4.2.7).
(322)a. g̃ȕʼ-né-küʼ́ ü
b. ũ-́ né-küʼ́ ü
c. pe̋-né-ànèbark-repeatedly?-intens.iter‘to bark’clap-repeatedly?-space‘be thunderclaps
all around’go.sg-repeatedly?-intens.iter‘to take steps’(iii) /-ēnǖ/ ‘?’. The meaning of this morpheme is unclear. It might bear some
relation with the notion of horizontality.
(323)a. ba̋iʼ-ēnǖ
b. dḛ-ēnǖ
c. wi ̄-ēnǖilluminate-?‘illuminate (with a flash light)’be.straight-?‘to aim (a projectile weapon)’stick.one’s.tongue.out-? ‘to stick one’s tongue out’The synchronically unanalyzable verb dăwēnǖ ‘to watch’ might have been historically derived from dău ‘to see’ by means of the suffix /-ēnǖ/.
(iv) Possible additional suffixes. Other possible derivational suffixes of the
verb root with unclear meanings include /-chà/ (as in /gûʼ(-?)chà/ ‘be difficult’,
based on the verb root gûʼu ‘be detrimental’), /-kà/ (as in /ngi ̂ʼ(-?)kà/ ‘to till (a patch
of land)’, based on the synonymous verb root ngi ̂ʼi), /-ʼna̰ʼü̃́/ (as in /kú(-?)ʼna̰ʼü̃́/ ‘to
laugh’, based on the synonymous verb root kú), and /-nǜ/ (as in /dău(-?)nǜ/ ‘to

watch’, based on the verb root dău ‘to see’). Because these hypothetical morphemes—if they can be rightly isolated at all—are most likely not synchronically
productive, verb stems potentially containing one of them are treated as unanalyzable lexical items of their own in this grammatical description.","[317, 318, 319, 320, 321]"
"4.5.3.2Factitive constructionAlthough of much more limited use than the passive construction, a converse
phenomenon also occurs, whereby predicative phrases usually employed intransitively are occasionally used transitively with no derivational morphology involved.
I call “factitive construction” the transitive use of a predicative phrase more typically used intransitively. The meaning of this construction can be roughly glossed as
‘to cause or induce something to be in the state denoted by the predicative phrase’.
Only intransitive predicative phrases with a stative Aktionsart may be submitted to
it. When this occurs, the single argument of the intransitive construction takes
on the syntactic function of core object in the resulting construction, but retains it semantic role of theme. The subject position of the resulting construction is occupied by an extra argument whose referent is semantically the agent
that causes the object argument to be the theme of the predicate. Contrast the
ordinary intransitive construction in example (443a) with the factitive construction
in (443b), both involving the predicative phrase /g̃e-̊ nátǖ/ (not.have-father) ‘not to
have a father’:
(443)a. Intransitive construction:

Contrast, in the same way, examples (444a) and (444b), which likewise feature the
same verb root tàʼkú ‘be an ophan’ used in an intransitive and a factitive construction, respectively:
(444)a. “[...] mārǖ pē-tàʼkúē.”

C486–490]3844.5. Valency operations
Likewise, non-verbal possessive predicative phrases in /-ã/̰ , although they
are mostly used intransitively (with the meaning ‘to have X’, as in e.g. /chā=di ̄ẽr̄ ùã/̰ [1sg.sbj=money-poss] ‘I have a dog/dogs’), may regularly be used transitively
with no morphological modification (with the meaning ‘to give X, to provide with
X’, as in e.g. /chā=nā=di ̄ẽr̄ ù-ã/̰ [1sg.sbj=3m/n/ns.obj=money-poss] ‘I gave
her/him money’). On the non-verbal predicative phrases in /-ã/̰ ‘poss’, see Section 4.3.3.6.
Just like the passive construction, the factitive construction does not affect the
predicative class of the predicative phrase it is applied to.
The factitive construction seems to stand in functional overlap with the causative construction in /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ in cases where the latter is derived from an
initially intransitive predicative phrase with a stative Aktionsart (on /-ʼẽʼ́ e/
‘caus’, see Section 4.5.2). Thus, for instance, the meaning of the intransitive verb
root tàʼkú ‘be an orphan’ used transitively in a factitive construction as in example
(444a) above (‘to cause or induce to be an orphan’) is essentially identical to the
meaning of the same intransitive verb root when it is used in a causative construction derived with /-ʼẽʼ́ e/ ‘caus’ (‘to cause to be an orphan’), as in the following
example:
(445)“Âi níì-ĩ ̊ yá pē-tàʼkúēʼẽʼ́ èkǖ.”

An instance of use of /-ku̽chi ́, -ku̽/ as a FGC suffix characterizing the spatial
relation of the figure relative to itself as it stands at the initial phase of the
process (i.e. in a case where the ground coincides with the figure itself) is provided
in the following example (see also (T88)):

down without moving from where you’re standing right now, as opposed
to moving and sitting down at a different spot than where you’re standing
right now]!’ [igs 290]2984.2. Verbal predicative phrases
For instances of use of /-ku̽chi ́, -ku̽/ apparently encoding a topological relation
of tight contact rather than one of containment, and where the ground is a subpart of the figure itself, see the verb stem /w̃ èʼ-kù/ (bind-in.pl) ‘to bind (a figure
to a ground)’ in predicates meaning ‘to bind hairs to one another’ in (T145–T149).
Grounds conceived of as featuring an inside, apart from the prototypical case of
physical envelopes enclosing a hollow space (such as a house, as in (285), or a bag,
as in (286–287)), may be any extended portion of space (whether hollow or not,
whether it possesses well-defined boundaries or not) that is considered to be physically or metaphorically homogeneous in all of its parts but heterogeneous
relative to its immediate surroundings (e.g. a forest relative to a clearing, as in
(289), or the other way around, as in (290) below; a solid underground relative
to the hollow space above its surface; a rounded-off volume extrapolated around
a body and considered as being occupied by it relative to the space that is not
comprised in that volume, as in (288) and (292) and (291) below; etc.).
The lexicalized verb stem /ǘ-kù/ (be.there.sg-in.pl) is irregular in that, although it is the singular allomorph of a PP meaning ‘to enter’ (which has a regular
plural allomorph /chó-kù/ [be.there.pl-in.pl]) and although its FGC suffix consequently characterizes the spatial relation of a singular entity (in this case, a singular
subject referent), it features the plural—instead of singular—allomorph of that FGC.
The following example shows an occurrence of this verb stem in discourse:
(289)̄ a̋ chi ̄-ük
́ ù!”
“Nāiʼnēküwnāiʼnēkü-̄ wa̋ chi ̄=ü-́ kù
jungle-aloc1sg.sbj.pci ̄.sbjv=be.there.sg-in.pl‘“I’m going into the jungle!”’ [igs 101]
The synchronically hardly analyzable verb root /po̊ʼkú/ ‘to punish (a singular or plural object)’ most likely lexicalized from a former verb stem ? /po̊ʼ-kú/
(block?-in.pl) meaning ‘to imprison (a plural object)’ (lit. ‘to block several entities
inside a ground’), potentially suggesting that imprisonment may be considered (or
have been considered) as the prototypical form of punishment in Tikuna culture.","[302, 303, 304]"

The chapter closes with a brief introduction to the encoding of the syntactic
functions of NPs (Section 3.6).","[184, 185, 186, 187]"
"3.1.2Introduction to the inflectional category of
nominal classTwo major grammatical categories are expressed in the inflectional paradigms of
several of the elements of the NP listed above, specifically nominal class and nominal tense. The category of nominal class comprises five different values, which I
call the feminine (f), the masculine (m), the neuter (n), the salientive (s), and
the non-salientive (ns) nominal classes, respectively. Agreement for nominal
class is obligatory at the clausal level, i.e. any morpheme within a NP that can
inflect for nominal class obligatorily occurs in its inflectional form corresponding to
the nominal class of the participant referred to by the NP. Morphemes that inflect
for nominal class (i.e. targets of agreement for nominal class) essentially include a
few independent nouns (tò ‘other’, åkǘ ‘what? who?’, åküʼ́ ü̃́ ‘thingy (filler word)’,
g̃eʼ̀ ü̃́ ‘which?’, mentioned here—by convention—in their non-salientive form), the
third person pronominal roots, the non-locative demonstrative roots, the relativizer suffix, and the linker. The inflectional paradigms of most of these morphemes are described at length in the remainder of this chapter. The forms of tò,
åkǘ, åküʼ́ ü̃́, g̃eʼ̀ ü̃́, and the relativizer, which are not discussed in this grammatical
description, are displayed in Table 23 for reference (the neuter allomorph of the
relativizer has a default shape /-ʼnè/, but takes the disyllabic shape /-ʼü̃́nè/ when
attached to a monosyllabic verb root). Note that the morphological shape of independent nouns and bound nouns, for their part, does not bear—in most cases—any
relation with the nominal class to which participants expressed by means of these
nouns are assigned in discourse. Third person indexes on the predicative phrase
also obligatorily agree for nominal class with the participant they represent. These
indexes are described in Chapter 5.

[...], my father, my mother [...], and other people who live here.’ [igv 32–
37]
Although three of the labels I use to refer to the nominal classes of smat (‘feminine, masculine, neuter’) are borrowed from the terminology of the grammatical
category of gender (as it is attested in e.g. Romance or Germanic languages), it is
important to note that smat’s nominal classes differ significantly from what is
traditionally labeled genders in that the assignment of participants to nominal
classes in smat is comparatively much more flexible. This assignment relies not
only on lexical properties of nouns, but also, to a large extent, on semantic
and pragmatic criteria. In example (133) above, for instance, the deer is assigned
to the non-salientive nominal class despite the fact that the independent noun kŏwǘ
‘deer’ shows a lexical “preference” for the masculine nominal class. This assignment
of the deer to the non-salientive nominal class occurs for pragmatic reasons. In the
context of the utterance, the deer appears as a despicable being who is having a
bad influence on a woman. In accordance with the evaluative perspective of the
speaker, the deer is “demoted” from its lexical nominal class to the non-salientive
nominal class. This marked assignment (since it does not match the noun’s preferred nominal class) activates the evaluative value of the non-salientive nominal
class, which connotes that the referent does not deserve particular respect.195
On the complex principles that govern nominal class assignment in smat,
which are not covered in this grammatical description, see Bertet (to appear).
This kind of pragmatic effect of nominal class assignment in smat related to notions such as
familiarity or respect vs lack thereof is remotely comparable to the effect, in English, that arises
from referring to a boat with a feminine pronoun vs with a neuter pronoun, or to an animal with an
animate pronoun vs with a neuter pronoun.
1951873. The nominal phrase3.1.3Introduction to the inflectional category of
nominal tenseNominal tense is a grammatical category that is expressed in the inflectional
paradigms of the non-locative and locative endophoric demonstrative words
(see Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.3), the ngē-/ye̊- words (a small class of words that are
historically derived from the non-locative demonstrative roots; see Section 3.4.8),
and the linker (see Section 3.5.1). The category of nominal tense in smat has two
values, which can be labeled as [-past/unspecified] and [+past], respectively.
A distinction has to be made between older and younger speakers as to how these
two values are put to use.
In the speech of most older speakers (e.g. gra, lar), these two values are
essentially—although not always strictly—mutually exclusive ([±past] system).
Within clauses which refer to processes that took place in a pre-hodiernal past (i.e.
at a time that precedes the day of utterance time), the [+past] forms of the endophoric demonstratives, the ngē-/ye̊- words, and the linker are regularly used. By
contrast, within clauses which refer to processes that did not take place in a prehodiernal past (e.g. processes that occurred earlier today or that are presently occurring, prospective or future processes, generic processes, etc.), the [-past] forms
are used instead.
Contrast example (135), which refers to non-pre-hodiernal events, with (136),
an excerpt from a traditional story that refers to pre-hodiernal past events (in this
case, events situated in the remote past of traditional narratives). Both were uttered
by the same speaker, whose speech is representative of that of older speakers.

someone’s eyes’ sounds approximately like Õ̊nátǘ] the ones who had had
their eyes gouged out.’ [lar A74]
In the clause in (135), the ngē-/ye̊- word meaning ‘because’ occurs in its [-past]
form (ērǘ), while it takes its [+past] form (ye̊rǘ) in (136). Likewise, the linker
in (135) occurs in [-past] forms, including in its two occurrences in false starts
where the speaker inflects it in the wrong nominal class (<i ̀...> <yà...> yá). In
(136), by contrast, the linker occurs in [+past] forms (gá, twice). Finally, the nonlocative endophoric in (135) occurs in its [-past] form (yi ̂ʼèmá), while the locative
endophoric (ye̋mà) and the non-locative endophoric (gûʼèmá) that occur in (136)
feature [+past] forms (note that the [+past] forms of endophorics are based on the
distal demonstrative roots, by contrast with their [-past] forms, which are based on
the medial demonstrative roots; on the analogy between distance in space and distance in time that operates in the use of the demonstrative roots, see Section 3.4.1).
Younger speakers (e.g. jgs, jsg), for their part, have generalized the use of
the [-past] forms of the endophoric demonstratives and the ngē-/ye̊- words in
all contexts, whether non-pre-hodiernal past or pre-hodiernal past. In the grammatical system that underlies their speech, the [-past] forms of these words can be said
to be in practice unspecified for nominal tense, rather than [-past]. These speakers interpret the [+past] forms of these words, which they almost never use
themselves, as mere optional variants of the [-past] forms available in specifically
pre-hodiernal past contexts ([unspecified] vs [+past] system). However, younger
speakers do maintain a use of the forms of the linker that relatively consistently
expresses explicitly [-past] vs [+past] values. That is, although the category of
nominal tense has become obsolete in the endophoric demonstratives and the
ngē-/ye̊- words as used by these speakers, that category remains essentially
valid in their use of the linker.
1893. The nominal phrase
Contrast example (137) with (136) above. The utterance in (137), an excerpt
from a story told in the pre-hodiernal past, was produced by jsg, whose speech is
representative of that of younger speakers.
(137)[...] ērǘ tá-tâiyà gá yîʼèmá.
ērǘtá=tâiyàgá=yîʼè-mábecause(.[-pst]) 3s.sbj=be.hungry lk.pst=med.s(.[-pst])-anaph‘[Somebody brought them ripe plantains for them to cook for the monkey]
because it was hungry.’ [jsg C115]
Although the events being referred to are (fictitiously) situated in a pre-hodiernal
past, the speaker uses the [-past] (i.e., in practice for him, the [unspecified]) form
of the ngē-/ye̊- word meaning ‘because’ (ērǘ) and a [-past] form of the endophoric
demonstrative (yi ̂ʼèmá). In accordance with the temporal setting of the events, the
speaker does employ, however, a [+past] form of the linker (gá).
Nominal tense often gives rise to agreement-like phenomena (as in (135–136),
for instance, where entire clauses, and in particular entire NPs, feature only [-past]
or only [+past] forms). Although it is by nature expressed within the NP,196 nominal tense does not seem to be, however, a feature of NPs but a feature of
clauses. In this respect, it is not comparable with nominal class, in particular (on
which see the preceding section).
I have not delved into the semantics of nominal tense for this research. Note,
in any case, that it makes no doubt that nominal tense in smat is not an aspectual category (i.e. one that involves the encoding of a temporal relation that holds
between an event time and a reference time) but a tense category (i.e. one that
involves the encoding of a temporal relation that holds between a reference time
and utterance time). The [+past] forms of the words that inflect for nominal tense
in smat can never be used in contexts that refer to future events (i.e. that are posterior to utterance time), for instance. If nominal tense in smat were an aspectual
category, i.e. one that in principle bears no direct relation to utterance time, this
restriction would not be expected.
The grammatical category of tense in smat, apart from operating within NPs
through nominal tense, can also be encoded at the clausal level by means of the
Except, arguably, in the case of the ngē-/ye̊- words. Although all of them can be hypothesized to
have originated diachronically from nominal words, some of them, such as the discourse connector
ērü/́ ye̊rǘ ‘because’, are no longer nominal in today’s smat.

morphology of the predicative phrase, by contrast, does not provide any means for
the encoding of tense.","[190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196]"
"7.2.3Privative negationAnother context in which the mere adjunction of tãů ‘neg’ is not normally available as a strategy to convert a positive clause into its corresponding negative clause
is when possessive predication is involved (on positive possessive predication, see
Sections 4.2.5.3 and 4.3.3.6). In other words, a clause that predicates possession
by means of the possessive predicative suffix /-ã/̰ and/or the possessive verb ã̄ ‘to
have’ in its positive polarity (e.g. /chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I have a dog’ or /chā=ã-̄ pátā/
̊
‘I have a house’) can normally not be negated by means of tãů ‘neg’ (e.g. ? /tãu
̊ chā=ã-̄ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a house’).
chā=âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or ? /tãu
A dedicated privative (i.e. negative possessive) verb root /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’

is regularly used instead and no other marker of negation appears in the clause
(e.g. /chā=g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ âirű-ã/̰ ‘I don’t have a dog’ or /chā=g̃e-̊ pátā/ ‘I don’t have a
house’).298
As is regularly the case when incorporation of a nominal constituent into the
predicative phrase occurs (on incorporation, see Section 4.2.5), if the referent
whose being possessed is negated is referred to with a bound noun, then the privative predicative word takes on the form /g̃e-̊ /bound.noun (not.have-bound.noun),
as in examples (617–618). By contrast, if that referent is referred to with a full NP
(and with an independent noun in particular), then the privative predicative phrase
takes on the structure /g̃e-̊ ãr̀ ǖ NP-ã/̰ (not.have-gen NP-poss), as in (619).

"7.6Pro-sentential negationThere is no morpheme specialized in pro-sentential negation in smat. Negative
pro-sentences result from the mere ellipsis of any other constituent than the
negative word from what their equivalent full negative clause would be (although
that negative word’s clitics and/or mārǖ ‘prf’ often remain, if present, as in the
first half of example (644)). Thus, (644) can be interpreted as being based on a full
̊ ʼǘ̃=mā=nü̂wa̋/ [/maloca-wa̋ tā=måʼ-ē-gǘ gá nůʼkǘmá./] ‘[We]
clause such as /Tãu

based on a full clause such as Tãů ʼü̃́ [/chā=/ti ́mido.] ‘[I’m] not [tímido.]’. Example
(646) starts with the realization of a full clause, and then proceeds to “repeating”
that same clause by means of tågù ‘never’ used as a pro-sentential negation marker.

However, where a specialized negative word (e.g. tåʼu ‘be absent’, /g̃e-̊ / ‘not
have’, tåʼúgù ‘never’, etc.) would be regularly expected in a full negative clause,
̊ ‘neg’ (or its variant tãu
̊ ʼü̃́) can work as a universal pro-sentential negation
tãu
marker, much like English ‘no!’. Thus, in example (647) (repeated from (635)
above, although with a more literal translation), while in fact privative negation
is involved (which could have triggered the use of the specialized privative verb
/g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ in the pro-sentential part of the speaker’s answer), the less specific
negation marker tãů ‘neg’ is used instead of /g̃e-̊ / ‘not have’ (here under its irregular
̊ =mā/ ‘neg-precisely’; see Section 7.5 above):
combinatorial variant tåmā, for /tãu

Note that when the remaining negative word is tãů ‘neg’, it may indeed be re̊ ʼü̃́
alized as tãů , but it also frequently occurs under its conservative variant tãu
(while this variant is marginal in full clauses; see Section 7.2.1 above), as in examples (644–645). By contrast, it does not seem to be able to occur under its innovative
denasalized variant tåu. This phonological conservatism of the pro-sentential use
5377. Negation
of tãů ‘neg’, as compared to its ordinary clausal use, is likely due to the fact that tãů
‘neg’ is normally left unstressed in the latter use, while it obligatorily bears stress
in the former.
In answers to interro-negative questions (e.g. ‘Don’t you like it?’), pro-sentential negation is pragmatically used for confirmation by the speaker of the assumption of the addressee (‘No, [I don’t like it indeed.]’), as shown in the following example:
(648)[Tãů tàã̄ k[i ̄]-pà?]—Tãů ʼü!̃́
tãů =tàã̄̊ ʼü̃́
tãuk[i ̄]=pàneg=itself 2sg.sbj.pci ̄=be.tired neg‘[(Denis Bertet:) Aren’t you tired yet?]—No [I’m not]!’ [jsg A403]7.7Negative imperativeNegation cannot co-occur with a predicative phrase in the Imperative Inflectional Type (on which see Section 5.4). The negative imperative construction used
to express prohibitives, whether with a singular or a plural second person subject,
seems to be based on the negation focus construction described in Section 7.5
above (focalized.negative.word (inflected.copula) (lk=)clause.in.sbjvsub). By contrast to the negation focus construction, however, the prohibitive construction does not seem to ever involve the use of the inflected copula, and it often—
although not obligatorily—includes an additional specialized prohibitive second
position enclitic /=tā/ ‘proh’ (focalized.negative.word=proh (lk=)
clause.in.sbjv-sub).309 My corpus and elicitation notes only contain cases of prohibitives involving the negative word tãů ‘neg’, such as the following:
(649)Tãů (tā) (i ̀) “nôʼe̋” ña̋kùʼü̃́ tüʼ̂ ü!̃̄
̊ (=tā)
tãu(i ̀=)nôʼe̋ña̋-kù-ʼü̃́tü-̂ ʼü̃̄neg=proh lk.ns=old.woman do.thus-2sg.sbj\sbjv-sub 3s-acc‘Don’t call her “grandma”!’ [ear elic.]
(650)Tãů tā ì pē-chókùgüʼ̋ ü!̃́According to ear, using the (optional) linker in the prohibitive construction imparts extra
directive strength to the prohibition and may make it sound more threatening.

However, it is possible that the prohibitive construction may also take existential
negative indefinites (see Section 7.3 above) in its position for focalized negative
words (with meanings such as ‘Don’t touch anything!’ or ‘Never tell them about
it!’).3107.8Negation and coordinationNegative polarity and coordination do not display any specific interaction.
Negation and coordination in the expression of groups such as ‘X and not Y’, ‘not
X and Y’, or ‘not X and not/nor Y’ (with X and Y being either arguments or whole
clauses) are thus encoded separately by their ordinary dedicated markers. The
following example illustrates the coordination of two negative clauses (of the type
‘not X and not/nor Y’), which is ordinarily done by means of the general coordination marker rǜ ‘and’:

"4.5Valency operations applied to the verb root and
the predicative phraseSmat features three antipassive suffixes, i.e. valency-decreasing suffixes associated with the loss of an object argument position corresponding to the deletion
or demotion of a referent with a patient-like semantic role. These are discussed in
Section 4.5.1.
Section 4.5.2 discusses the causative suffix /-ʼẽʼ́ e/, a valency-manipulating
morpheme whose main effect is that of allowing for the additional expression of a
causer referent in the syntactic position of a subject.
The passive and factitive constructions are two valency-manipulating constructions that do not involve the use of any dedicated derivational morphology.
The former allows for the deletion of the agent referent from transitive predicates.
The occurrence of the latter is restricted to stative intransitive predicative phrases
and—similarly to the causative suffix /-ʼẽʼ́ e/—allows for the additional expression

541OverviewThis chapter deals with the morphemes and constructions that are resorted
to for setting a clause’s polarity to negative. The major functions related to
negative polarity and the morphosyntactic strategies applied to execute them are
briefly summarized in Table 49. These aspects, and a few more, are discussed in
detail in the next sections (the corresponding sections are referred to by numbers
in parentheses in Table 49). For a typological discussion of most of the functions
identified in Table 49, see van der Auwera & Krasnoukhova (2020). The structure of this entire chapter is inspired by Miestamo (2017) and van der Auwera &

Tãů ‘neg’, in its function of general marker encoding the negative polarity of a
clause without affecting in any way its morphosyntactic structure, can be used in a
large variety of contexts. In particular, tãů ‘neg’ occurs:
– with most types of predicative phrases, whether verbal (as in examples (601–
604) and (608–609)) or non-verbal (as in (605–607));
– in both main clauses (as in (601), (603–606), and (609)) and subordinate
clauses (as in (607–608));
– with both the Indicative Inflectional Type (as in (602) and (604–606)) and
the Subjunctive (and Subjunctive + /-ʼǘ̃/ ‘sub’) Inflectional Type (as in (601),
(603), and (607–610));
– and in declarative utterances (as in (601) and (603–606)), interrogative utterances (as in (609)), and exclamative utterances (as in (606)).

However, as will be shown in the following sections, tãu

– in the negation of clauses that would feature existential indefinite arguments in the positive polarity (7.3);

– in association with the Imperative Inflectional Type (7.7).
Tãů ‘neg’, a phonologically anomalous word in that its only syllable combines
an oral onset together with a nasal nucleus, is likely to have arisen etymologically
from a phonetic reduction of /tåʼú-ʼü̃́/ ‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ (lit. ‘(a/the)
non-existing’), i.e. the regular subject participant relativization in the non-salientive nominal class of the negative existential verb tåʼu ‘be absent’. /Tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/ ‘be.
absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ is in fact still used in its unreduced form to express meanings
such as ‘no X, none, nothing, nobody’ (see Section 7.3 below). It is unclear, however, through what kind of grammaticalization path a relativization like /tåʼú-ʼǘ̃/
‘be.absent\sbjv-rel.ns’ may have ended up functioning as the most general negative marker in smat.","[522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527]"
