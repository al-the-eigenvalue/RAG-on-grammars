"6.1 Basic constituent order
The basic constituent order in a clause in Makalero is SOV. This overall order holds
for both kinds of verb-phrase-internal arguments. Thus, O has to be understood here
as a cover term for both object and complement arguments as introduced in § 5.2THE CLAUSE387(p. 319). For illustration, (12) shows a clause with a semantically intransitive verb
with SV order, and (13) one with a transitive verb, with SOV order.
(12)[Uru-uatu ere]SUBJ [tafi hau pere]PRED…
moon-sun1DEMtrueallbig.SG‘The lord is truly great…’
(13)... [asi-pada(33-33)Timor]SUBJ [ani]OBJ [pase]PRED...1s:POSS-friend T.1sbeat‘… my fellow Timorese beat me…’(101-037)With very limited morphology to clarify a given NP’s function in the sentence and
its relation to the verb, word order is the main device to indicate the grammatical
role of an NP. While such word order changes as dislocation of a constituent into the
left-detached position are possible (see § 9.2.1, p. 495), they are in fact rarely used,
overall.","[411, 412]"
"4.3.5.7 The relative sentence head in the matrix clause
The relative sentence’s head can function either as the subject or as non-subject
argument (i.e. object or complement) in the matrix clause. (135), showing the
appropriate bracketing, is a sentence in which the head functions as the subject. The
constituent order in this sentence as a whole conforms to the basic SOV word order.
(135)[Surat=ua ei=ua haka ere] SUBJ [aramari]COMPL-[mutu’]V.
book=REL2s=REL search 1DEMcupboard-inside‘The book that you are looking for is inside the wardrobe.’(elic444)In the case where the relative sentence’s head is a non-subject argument of the
matrix clause, there are two options: in the first of these, the non-subject argument
stands in situ, that is, preceding the verb and following the subject argument. (136)
gives such an example, again with the main constituents bracketed.",[336]
"24CHAPTER 11.6.6 The clause
The unmarked word order in the clause is SOV. The subject argument generally has
little repercussion on the rest of the clause. With a number of verbs which inflect for
subject number, the number of the subject (whether overtly marked or not)
determines the form of the verb. Apart from this, the use of the reflexive pronoun ni
marks coreferentiality with the subject. Furthermore, the NP clitic =ini, analysed in
§ 9.2.3.1 (p. 501) as a contrastive marker, appears to be developing into a subject
marker, which is used whenever a speaker considers word order alone not to be
enough to clarify the subject referent. This may be the case in sentences with noncanonical word order, or if the subject argument is considerably lower on the topicworthiness hierarchy than the second argument.
As mentioned in § 5.2 (p. 319), the non-subject argument can syntactically be
realised in two ways, namely either as an object or as a complement. Either of these
is a possible filler of the verb’s syntactic argument position. Any additional
arguments need to be expressed in a separate clause. Such multi-clause units are
termed ‘sentences’ and discussed in § 7 (p. 401).
Operators (as defined by Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 40) that work on clause-level
in Makalero are aspect, negation and status.","[48, 49]"
"9.2.1 Non-canonical word orders
Non-canonical word orders are overall relatively rare; the overwhelming majority of
clauses found in natural discourse conform to the unmarked SOV word order.
In sentences with non-canonical word orders, a constituent is generally leftdislocated. The syntactic position involved in left-dislocation is the LDP, discussed
in detail in § 7.6.1 (p. 427). Note that this position is on sentence-level, rather than
clause-level; as such, left-dislocated constituents can be separated from the clause
they belong to by an intervening adverbial or other clause.",[520]

complexesTable 1.5: Makalero and Papuan languages compared: syntax
In the domain of syntax, Makalero shows the largest degree of agreement with the
Papuan language type, conforming to it with respect to general phrase headedness,
word order, as well as the place of the determiner and the modifier with a noun.
Makalero agrees with Foley’s 22 characteristic Papuan features 10 as reproduced in
Tables 1.3. through 1.5, in only 8 instances, most of which are found in syntax.
Apart from the vocabulary, syntax thus provides the strongest argument for its
classification as Papuan.11
Foley (1998: 506f.) contrasts this Papuan language type with an ‘Austronesian
language type’. The characteristics he lists for this language type may perhaps
adequately represent the Austronesian languages in the New Guinea area but cannot
be said to be characteristic of the Austronesian family as a whole and are thus not
reproduced here. Notably, however, Makalero agrees with Foley’s Austronesian
language type to more or less the same degree (i.e. number of features) as it does
with the Papuan language type. With respect to other features, it does not group
clearly with either of the two contrasting language types. Over very similar results,
Schapper (2009: 31) concludes that Papuan Bunak displays “a particular ‘insular
eastern Indonesian’ linguistic type which cross-cuts the distinction between Papuan
and Austronesian.” This conclusion clearly also holds for Makalero.
Interestingly, Klamer, Reesink and Staden (2008) propose an East Nusantara
linguistic area, in which Austronesian and Papuan languages coexist and share a
number of features which are partly of Papuan, partly of Austronesian origin. It must
be noted, however, that this linguistic area is based on only five relatively broad
features, of which only two are clearly manifested in Makalero (i.e. possessorpossessum order in adnominal possession and the presence of an inclusive /
10The total of 22 counts the syntactic features in Table 1.5 each separately, despite the fact that most of
them are concomitants of SOV.
11
Note, however, that word order is not a sound basis for language classification, since languages may
change their basic word order (see Heine 2008: 34f. for some contact-induced examples of this process).","[39, 40]"

‘it is her’ if seen as the nominal predicate in a minimal clause of its own. This is
followed by the predicate tu ‘go first’; the clause combination of kiloo=ni tu would
thus translate as ‘it was her (and she) went first’. Similarly, ani (1s) in the second
sentence as a nominal predicate translates as ‘it is me’. It is followed by the
predicate sofit ‘go behind’, and the two combine as something like ‘it is me (and I)DISCOURSE STRUCTURE503went behind’. Note how these literal translations resemble English cleft
constructions.
It has been elaborated in § 6.2.1 (p. 389) that =ini appears to be evolving into a
subject marker. As such, it is found frequently in sentences with non-canonical word
order. Particularly in cases where the object is left-dislocated and the grammatical
roles are not clarified by other criteria (such as world knowledge or the topicworthiness hierarchy, see § 6.2.1, p. 389), it is important to mark the subject
participant as such, since both an SOV sentence as well as a sentence with OSV
order look superficially identical, namely NP – NP – V. In such cases, it is the
marker =ini which ensures the correct interpretation of the sentence. Examples
where the object precedes a subject marked as such by =ini are given in (34) and
(35).

kiloo so’ot.many.HUM=CTR 3swant‘Not many people like him.’(elic1569a)In both of these sentences, a prototypical human agent in the guise of the third
person singular pronoun kiloo is being acted upon by a less topic-worthy entity; in
(23), this is a dog, and in (24), an unspecified group of actors, expressed by the NP
amulafu nomo rial ‘not many people’. The use of the canonical SOV word order is
apparently not perceived to be sufficient to clarify the grammatical roles in these
particular sentences, and the subject is additionally marked with =ini. Examples as
(25) below, where a third person nominal agent acts upon a first person singular
patient, show that not only non-human referents and indefinite expressions are
understood to be unlikely agents, but, given the right context, also a human agent
such as asi-upa ‘my father’. Obviously, the first person singular pronoun, which
expresses the undergoer in (25), is an even better agent than an NP with a human
referent for Makalero speakers; consequently, the latter has to be marked to show
that it acts on the first person pronoun rather than vice versa.
(25)... asi-upa=niani mei ira teuh...1s:POSS-father=CTR 1stake water buy‘… my father used me to buy water with…’(89-14)390CHAPTER 6On the basis of the usage of the subject marker =ini, the topic-worthiness hierarchy
shown in (26) can be deduced.
(26)Personal pronouns > Nouns (specific) > Nouns (indefinite)
1>2>3[+HUM] > [-HUM]In other words, personal pronouns are more likely to be interpreted as agents or
topics than nouns, and nouns with a specific referent are in turn more likely agents
than nouns with indefinite referents. Within the domain of personal pronouns, the
speech-act participants are better subjects than the third person pronouns, and a first
person pronoun is higher in the hierarchy than a second person pronoun. With
specific nouns, human referents are preferred as agents and topics over non-human
referents. As such, the Makalero agentivity hierarchy conforms neatly to the general
topic-worthiness hierarchy as shown e.g. in Payne (1997: 150).
Note, however, that this hierarchy is not grammaticalised. In other words, whether
or not to mark a low-ranking topic as such is up to the speaker in Makalero, and in
an appropriate context, which helps clarifying the grammatical roles, untypical
constellations may be unmarked. Hence sentences as (27), with an unmarked
nominal agent and a pronominal patient, are found alongside such examples as (25)
above.
(27)Asi-meestriani nomo pase...1s:POSS-teacher 1sNEGbeat‘My teacher didn’t beat me…’(elic093)Another group of cases where the subject is commonly marked with =ini consists of
very long and complex subject NPs. In these cases, =ini could be said to function as
a boundary marker showing the right end of the subject NP to facilitate the
processing of the sentence by the hearer. Examples with such complex subject NPs
are given in (28) and (29), where square brackets indicate the extent of the NPs in
question. In (28), the subject’s head noun mataniki ‘children’ is accompanied by a
lengthy verbal modifier tafi-tafi hau rial ‘really very many’; similarly, in (29), the
head noko ‘younger sibling’ stands with a verbal modifier. This particular case is
complicated by the fact that the nominal predicate of this modifier is actually
identical to the head noun itself. The processing of both of these sentences is
significantly facilitated through the presence of the subject marker =ini.

which deviate from the usual SOV constituent order, as in (30). § 9.2.1 (p. 495)
gives a more detailed discussion of non-canonical word orders.

The term ‘non-subject argument’ is used as a cover term subsuming both objects and
complements; see § 5.2 (p. 319) for a detailed discussion of these two types of
verbal arguments. A typical non-subject argument is an NP headed by either a noun
or pronoun, or alternatively by a verb phrase or full clause. Examples of either
structure are given in (31), where ni-mata ‘her child’ is a prototypical undergoer,
and (32), where the argument to k-asu ‘for’ is a whole clause, respectively.

face-cover-move=INT3:UND-for‘We work hard for the development (lit. the going-forward) of our nation.’
(elic1258)
NPs can be constructed both as objects and as complements (§ 5.2.1, p. 319, and
§ 5.2.2.1, p. 321).
Another possible type of non-subject argument is a dependent VP. Such VPs can
only be constructed as complements. § 5.2.2.4 (p. 337) argues that syntactically,
such VP arguments in complement-verb complexes are treated in the same way as
nominal arguments in that either fill the predicate’s syntactic non-subject argument
postion. An example of this is given in (33), where rau ‘good’ fills the complement
position of the transitive verb pase ‘beat’, causing the semantic undergoer of the
beating action, ani (1s), to be expressed in a separate clause with mei ‘take’.
(33)... papauere ani tafi mei=niIndonesian 2DEM 1s[rau]COMP-pase.true take=LNK1 good-beat‘… the Indonesian beat me thoroughly.’(101-270)This shows that the nature of the syntactic second argument to the verb is
unspecified, and it need not be a participant of the action expressed by the predicate
in question. Rather, it can also be a dependent VP giving circumstantial information392CHAPTER 6of various kinds (in (33), this is manner). Thus, what would correspond to arguments
and adjuncts in English are not distinct in status in Makalero, but are treated equally
as non-subject arguments. These arguments can be mapped onto the clause template
in a variety of ways (see § 7.1, p. 402, for a more detailed discussion).
A nominal non-subject argument is preferably lower on the topic-worthiness
hierarchy than the subject. If the reverse is the case, and there are no contextual
clues to help the hearer interpret the clause correctly, the subject is generally marked
as such with the subject marker =ini (see § 6.2.1, p. 389 above). However, there is
no way to specifically mark an object as such.
Just like subjects, objects can be left-dislocated into the left-detached position in the
sentence for pragmatic purposes. For a more in-depth discussion, see § 9.2.1 (p. 495)
on non-canonical word orders.","[414, 415, 416, 417]"
"1.6.9 Discourse structure
Since Makalero has no case marking and no verbal agreement, and allows for the
left-dislocation of participants, the correct interpretation of grammatical roles is
potentially problematic. However, there are several devices aiding the hearer in this
respect. An important indicator helping reference tracking across the text are the
clause linkers =ini and =isi. As noted in § 8.1.1 (p. 457), the former is commonly
associated with topic (or subject) continuity, while the use of the latter normally
coincides with a topic change. Another grammatical item that contributes to
reference tracking is the reflexive pronoun ni, which, both as an NP on its own as
well as in adnominal use, denotes coreference with the subject participant. As such,
any NP containing this pronoun is necessarily a non-subject. Furthermore, the
contrastive marker =ini appears to be developing into a subject marker that is used to
clarify subject reference in sentences with non-canonical word order or cases where
the subject argument is much lower on the topic-worthiness hierarchy than the
second argument. Also, the NP clitic =haka, which serves to mark the contradiction
to a presupposition, occurs on subject arguments only. As such, it has a secondary
subject-marking function.
The majority of sentences in Makalero follows the unmarked SOV word order.
However, either argument may be placed in the left-detached position. These leftdislocated arguments may be both topics and foci. Most foci in the LDP are
relatively long and may be taken up in situ by a pronoun. As such, § 9.2.1.2 (p. 498)
concludes that the issue in those cases is the length of the constituent in question
rather than its focality. Consequently, the main function of the LDP is to hold topics.
§ 9.2.2 (p. 500) discusses an explicit focus construction in which a clause with an
empty position is followed by the same or a very similar clause with that position
filled. This focus construction quite nicely implements the common definition of
focus as the part of a proposition by which the assertion differs from the
presupposition.
Makalero disposes of a number of clitic or adverbial markers which have to do with
information structure. The most important of these is the contrastive clitic =ini. ThisINTRODUCTION27is found on both topical and focal participants. It is likely an extension of the clause
linker =ini and appears to separate the contrastive argument from the rest of the
clause. As such, these constructions display a high degree of similarity to cleft
constructions. The clitic =haka marks the contradiction of a presupposition. Na’amuni, which is predicative in status, equivalent to avalent adverbial predicates,
appears to mark the beginning of a new scene or event. The clitic =oo ‘too’ is a
frequently used concessive linker. However, it also occurs in a variety of cases,
often in pairs, where this translation does not make sense. As such, it appears to
have some information structuring use, which requires further research.
On a higher level of text organisation, it is noticeable that narratives are normally
introduced by a sentence stating the content of the text. These sentences are very
frequently associated with a particular word order. Texts are normally concluded by
a closing sentence, which states that the speaker is finished.
A conspicuous feature of Makalero narratives is the use of tail-head linkage. A
feature characteristic of ritual speech, lexical parallelism, has in some expressions
also found its way into everyday speech.","[51, 52]"

(lit. I don’t know these two different words).know(elic1233)It appears that an important factor determining whether or not a left-dislocated
object NP is recapitulated in situ through a resumptive pronoun is the agentworthiness hierarchy, which states that personal pronouns and nouns denoting
human referents are prototypical actors (e.g. Payne 1997: 150). That is, a personal
pronoun is normally understood to be the agent, even if the unmarked order of
subject and object is inverted. Note that in both (138) and (139), the agent is a
personal pronoun; hence it is not absolutely necessary for the preposed object to
reappear in the guise of a pronoun in situ to ensure the correct interpretation of
syntactic roles in the sentence in question. In (137), on the other hand, the leftdislocated object argument is a pronominal form (see § 3.3.1.1.2, p. 221), and thus aTHE NOUN PHRASE313prototypical agent. To ensure the correct reading of the sentence, it is thus necessary
to take up the left-dislocated constituent as a resumptive pronoun in situ.
In (140), both participants are full NPs. However, an animate, human entity such as
denoted by amuni namiraa ‘male person’ is a far more likely agent-subject than tali
‘rope’, and the sentence is correctly interpreted despite the main arguments’ inverted
order.168

"DISCOURSE STRUCTURE4959.2 Information structure
The terminology used in the present short discussion of information structure
follows Lambrecht (1996) in most respects. In that work, information structure is
defined as “that component of sentence grammar in which propositions as
conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical
structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret
these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts” (ibid: 5). A
referent is interpreted as the topic of a proposition “if in a given situation the
proposition is construed as being about this referent, i.e. as expressing information
which is relevant to and which increases the addressee’s knowledge of this referent”
(Lambrecht 1996: 131). Focus, on the other hand, is defined as “[t]he semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs
from the presupposition” (Lambrecht 1996: 213). In discourse, the correlation
between subject and topic is generally very strong. In a typical clause, the predicate
asserts new information about this topic; it is thus the focus. This neatly describes
the unmarked case, in which the subject is the topic and the object part of the focus,
in Makalero. However, other constellations of topic and focus structure and the
grammatical expression of a sentence are possible. These are discussed below in so
far as they find grammatical expression in discourse. § 9.2.1 (p. 495) gives some
observations on non-canonical word orders, § 9.2.2 (p. 500) treats a specific focus
construction, and § 9.2.3 (p. 500) discusses some particles related to the structuring
of information.","[519, 520]"

(101-304)
Quite apart from these cases, where participants are left unexpressed, a variety of
temporal verbs such as aire’ ‘now’, and soohe’ ‘yesterday’, which are commonly
used to indicate adverbial information in the form of a separate clause, have a
syntactic valency of zero. As such, they are not compatible with the expression of
any argument and always form clause cores of their own (see § 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141).
Since either verbal argument can be left unexpressed, the interpretation of the
grammatical role of an overt NP is not trivial. The problem, as well as some
disambiguating strategies, are discussed in § 9.1 (p. 491).
In the remainder of this section, basic constituent order is explained in § 6.1
(p. 386), followed by a description of the constituent parts of the clause. Starting in
§ 6.2 (p. 387), subject arguments are discussed; § 6.3 (p. 391) briefly treats the nonsubject argument, § 6.4 (p. 392) the predicate, and § 6.5 (p. 393) the clause
periphery. § 6.6 (p. 393) discusses operators functioning at clause level or below.

The use of the classifiers is rather restricted and is associated most strongly with
actual counting, such as in (62). The classifier and the numeral stand in the modifier
position of the noun phrase (§ 4.3, p. 279), with the numeral following the classifier.
Note that classifiers are nominal, while numerals are analysed as a subtype of verbs
(§ 3.2.3.8, p. 171); the relative ordering of classifiers and numerals in Makalero thus

The pronouns in Table 3.43 are free forms used as NP heads. There are special
possessive forms for use as possessive modifiers in the NP (§ 3.3.1.1.3, p. 225).
Unlike Fataluku and Bunak (see e.g. Hull 2004: 80f), Makalero does not make a
distinction between subject and object pronouns. The third person pronouns are, in
this and other respects, somewhat exceptional (see § 3.3.1.1.2, p. 221). Makalero
pronouns are invariable and are used in both subject and object function, as shown
in (350) and (351), where the correct interpretation of grammatical relations relies
solely on the word order.
(350)Ani ei pase.
1s2s beat‘I beat you.’
(351)Eiani pase.2s1s(elic013)beat‘You beat me.’(elic014)The first person singular pronoun ani and its plural counterpart ini (the first person
plural exclusive), as well as the second person singular pronoun ei and its plural
counterpart i seem morphologically related, with the plural forms associated with
vowel-fronting and vowel-raising. Such a relation between singular and plural (or
non-singular) forms is, in fact, a characteristic feature of the pronominal systems of
the Trans-New Guinea family, according to Wurm (1982: 78).120
In the first person plural, Makalero distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive
forms. Since Trans-New Guinea languages commonly lack such a distinction
(Wurm 1982: 60), its presence has been speculated to be due to Austronesian
influence (Klamer et al. 2008: 95). The first person plural exclusive is related
through vowel raising to the first person pronoun throughout the Timor-Alor-Pantar
group, e.g. in Fataluku (Campagnolo 1975: 136), Bunak (Schapper 2009: 91), Teiwa
(Klamer 2010: 77) and Abui (Kratochvil 2007: 77). Also, all of these languages
evidence a form related to fi (afiru in Fataluku and pi in both Teiwa and Abui 121) for

"NSITumu] ain.

alternatives with those verbs that have been found with the complementiser =ee
(§ 3.2.3.10.1.1, p. 187).
Note that the verb fatar ‘force’ in (265) has both a preverbal non-subject argument
(presumably an object) as well as a complement clause extension following the verb,
while leu ‘call’ in (266) has a preverbal complement as well as a complement clause
extension. In fact, most of the verbs in Table 3.31 are found in such constructions,
where the complement clause extension follows a complete clause with two
arguments. This seems to contradict the strictly divalent nature of most verbs in
Makalero, which allows for only one argument other than the subject (see
§ 3.2.3.1.2, p. 143, and § 6, p. 383). Complement clause extensions are thus not
syntactic arguments of these verbs: If they functioned as arguments, they would be
expected to fill the verb’s argument position. As a consequence of this, the nonsubject argument and the verbal complement in such sentences as (265) and (266)
would have to be expressed in separate clauses with another verb. The fact that thisLEXICAL CATEGORIES191is not the case suggests a historical scenario in which such clausal complements
originated as arguments to another verb (§ 3.6.2, p. 265); a likely reflex of such a
construction is the quotative marker ain (§ 3.2.3.12.3, p. 205). (267) shows such a
sentence and gives the analysis.

(101-297)
With der ‘answer’, neok ‘lie’, ofarana ‘dream’, leu ‘call’, aka’ ‘scared’ and,
probably, fana ‘teach’ coreference of any participant of the complement clause
extension with the non-subject argument is not necessary. The subject of the
complement clause extensions to fatar ‘force’, pada ‘order’ and huma ‘order’, on
the other hand, is generally coreferent with the main verb’s non-subject argument.
An example is (265) above with fatar ‘force’. This coreferent participant is not
generally repeated in the complement clause extension, such that it usually takes the
form of a VP rather than a complete clause including a subject argument. In the case
of the remaining verbs, mot ‘dare’ and fuin ‘dare’, the subject of the complement
clause is generally coreferent with the subject of the main verb. Again, the
coreferent participant is not repeated, resulting in the complement clause taking the
form of a VP.","[215, 216]"
"5. The verb phrase
The verb phrase consists of a predicate and other constituents syntactically related to
it. It excludes the subject, about which it provides information. The term predicate is
used to refer only to the predicating element, or the head of the VP, following Van
Valin and LaPolla (1997: 26). (1) shows the structure of a verb phrase as found with
avalent verbs (§ 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141), while (2) and (3) schematically represent the two
distinct forms that a verb phrase headed by a divalent verb (§ 3.2.3.1.2, p. 143) can
take.
(1)VP
(ASP)(ADV)* HEAD(2)VP
(OBJ)(ASP)(ADV)* (NEG)(3)(ADV)* HEADVP
(ASP)(ADV)* (NEG)(ADV)* (COMPL)-HEADIn all cases, the verb phrase is strictly head-final, with all modifiers preceding it. The
only obligatory part of the VP is its head, the predicate. An avalent verb is
compatible only with aspect marking and adverbial modifiers, but does not take any
arguments. The modifiers of a verb phrase headed by divalent verbs, on the other
hand, include aspect marking, verb-phrase-internal adverbials and negation. There
are two positions for adverbials, one preceding and the other following the negation,
allowing for the expression of scope differences. Each of these adverbial positions
can hold one or more adverbial verbs of the group discussed in § 3.2.3.3.1 (p. 159).
The only difference between the two variant schemes for VPs headed by divalent
verbs in (2) and (3) is the position of the non-subject argument, which is VP-initial
in (2), standing to the left of all modifiers, but immediately preverbal in (3), where it
is preceded by all these modifiers. An immediately preverbal non-subject argument
as in (2) forms a morphosyntactic unit with the following predicate, as indicated in
the scheme by the use of the hyphen. In order to distinguish these two argument
positions, the VP-initial position as depicted in (2) is called object position, while
the immediately preverbal position as depicted in (3) is termed complement position.
Both of these positions can hold several coordinated arguments. The schematic
representations in (2) and (3) show that the two positions are mutually exclusive; a318CHAPTER 5VP with an object argument does not additionally provide a complement position
and vice versa. The issue of the two distinct argument positions within the VP is
discussed in detail in § 5.2 (p. 319).
(4) and (5) illustrate concrete instantiations of a VP with an object and a VP with a
complement, respectively, where the majority of available positions are filled.

the schemes in (2) and (3). Starting with the obligatory head, the predicate, in § 5.1
(p. 318), § 5.2 (p. 319) goes on to discuss the non-subject argument and its position
and status as either an object or a complement. Finally, § 5.3.1 (p. 361) through
§ 5.3.3 (p. 367) elaborate on aspect marking, negation and adverbials.","[341, 342, 343]"
"NSIT takecome‘I brought (the thing) you once talked about.’(elic999)The NPs in (7) and (8) consist only of determiners, namely the demonstrative uere

someNEGalong:RED-know‘Some didn’t understand…’(101-033)The overall order as shown in (1) must be maintained in all circumstances. Hence,
such NPs as (7) and (8) cannot under any circumstances appear with a modifier.
Not only nouns, but also verbs can function as NP heads. This property of Makalero
is a major reason for the difficulty to classify lexemes into such lexical categories as
nouns and verbs, as discussed in § 3 (p. 97). (9) shows an example of a prototypical
verb heading an NP: the function of the complement-verb complex isi-ne’et ‘think
(of)’ as a noun phrase head is unmistakable through the fact that it is preceded by the
first person possessive pronoun asi- (§ 3.3.1.1.3, p. 225); a possessive is necessarily
the first element of an NP. For comparison, (10) shows isi-ne’et ‘think (of)’ in its
prototypical verbal function.

"3. Lexical categories
According to most basic textbooks, a distinction between at least two lexical
categories, namely nouns and verbs, is a universal trait in languages (e.g. Payne
1997: 32). That is, they posit a basic distinction between the expression of objects
and actions, or reference and predication. There is, however, no consensus over this
seemingly basic fact: specific theories may define other sets of basic word classes.
For instance, Croft (2001: 63) argues for three universal basic word classes, namely
nouns, verbs and adjectives, with the chief functions of denoting objects, actions and
properties, respectively. Yet another approach argues that word class distinctions
must be considered a matter of degree (see e.g. Sasse 1993).
Evidence challenging traditional word class theory has, among others, been adduced
from Austronesian languages. Specifically, many individual Austronesian languages
have been analysed as lacking a noun/verb distinction. This may be illustrated by
such examples as (1) and (2) from Tongan (Broschart 1997: 134, examples (15) and
(16)).
(1)na’e lele e
PAST runkaufefinéSPEC PL:HUM woman.DEF‘The women were running.’
(2)na’e fefine kotoa e
PAST woman allkauleléSPEC PL:HUM run.DEF‘The ones running were all female.’
These sentences show how the word form fefine ‘woman’ can appear as both an
argument and a predicate, without any overt derivation. The same holds for lele
‘run’, which can be used both as a predicate as well as as an argument. These word
forms appear to be unspecified for lexical category, and it is only their function
within a given clause (i.e. whether they are used in the nominal slot, on the right
edge of the clause in the above examples, or in the verbal slot clause-initially) that
determines their translational equivalents as either arguments or predicates. In fact,
Broschart (1997: 128) arrives at the conclusion that Tongan is a language which
completely lacks a noun/verb distinction. Such characteristics are not restricted to
Tongan, but are fairly widespread in Austronesian languages. These languages are
approximations of Gilʼs (2000: 194, 202) language type with only one single but
open syntactic category. In this language type, “all words and phrases exhibit the
same syntactic behaviour”. A good overview of the issue is given in Himmelmann
(2005).
Makalero, even though no member of the Austronesian family genetically, is spoken
in a larger area dominated by Austronesian languages, and it is similar to these
languages in several respects. Among those is the fact that the translational
equivalents of verbs and nouns can quite freely be used in both argument and
predicate positions, respectively. This characteristic is not commonly associated
with Papuan languages (see § 1.5, p. 12).","[120, 121, 122]"
"LEXICAL CATEGORIES(8)mini (v)
mini (n)‘follow’
‘nose’(9)lu’a (v)
lu’a (n)‘not get’
‘monkey’99Furthermore, there are some class-changing derivational morphological processes
associated with nouns and verbs, respectively. A particularly clear example is the
deictic paradigm (§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180 and § 3.3.2.1, p. 232), which includes nominal
and verbal forms. However, most of these processes are of limited productivity, and
there is a large number of content words which are never used with any derivation.
A working definition of the main lexical categories based on other than
morphological criteria, which can capture these, is thus needed in order to make
generalisations over lexemes belonging to these classes possible.
Haspelmath (2001: 16543) points out that, despite the above-mentioned problems, it
is generally possible to categorise word forms into nouns and verbs in individual
languages. As an example, he gives the word fōma’i ‘doctor’ in Samoan (ibid.),
which can be translated both as ‘doctor’ and ‘being a doctor’. This contrasts with
alu, which translates as ‘go’ and the ‘fact of going’, rather than ‘person who goes’
(ibid.). The former would be categorised as a noun, while the latter is a verb. Such
semantic correspondences can be used in the determination of word classes,
alongside morphological processes, if present, as well as syntactic characteristics.
In the following, I will use a combination of such semantic features as used by
Haspelmath (2001) as well as specific morphological alternations and derivations for
the purpose of distinguishing lexical categories in Makalero. Content words are
classified as belonging to one of the open lexical classes of nouns or verbs. § 3.1
(p. 99) discusses nouns, giving a tentative definition and distinguishing a number of
subgroups based on phonological, morphological and syntactic criteria. § 3.2
(p. 125) proceeds analogously with verbs. Most function words are particles or
affixes that are associated with either the noun phrase or the verb phrase, or clitics
attached on phrase-level. These closed-category items contrast with the open
categories noun and verb in that they do not participate in the functional flexibility
exhibited by those classes. § 3.3 (p. 217) treats closed categories associated with the
noun phrase, while those discussed in § 3.4 (p. 241) are associated with the verb
phrase. § 3.5 (p. 243) introduces a variety of phrase-level clitic. Finally, § 3.6
(p. 264) elaborates on some unclear cases.","[123, 124]"

"4.2 The possessive phrase
The schematic representation of the NP in (1) above shows that the possessive
phrase is the only dependent within the noun phrase to precede the head. Though
this appears to be at odds with the otherwise head-initial structure of the NP, it does
conform to one of the features identified as Papuan in Klamer et al.’s (2008: 95)
East Nusantara linguistic area, namely “possessor-possessum order in adnominal
possession”.",[302]

Note that in the above sentences, either one or the other non-subject participant of a
ditransitive verb is expressed, but not both at the same time. In such a case, the nonsubject participant can be mapped onto the object position, irrespective of its
semantic role. If, on the other hand, all three participants in a ditransitive state of
affairs are to be expressed, the one highest on the animacy hierarchy is generally
realised as the non-subject argument of the main verb, while the other stands in a
clause with mei ‘take’. (10) gives a typical example.
(10)Meestri uere matematika mei=ni
teacher2DEM mathematicsani fana.take=LNK1 1steach‘That teacher teaches me maths.’(chat 112)A reversal of this order is taken to be significant. That is, (11) cannot be understood
to be a variant expression of (10). Instead, the animated participant, if expressed in a
separate clause with mei ‘take’, is in this case understood to function as a peripheral
participant.
(11)Meestri uere ani mei=ni
teacher2DEM 1smatematika fana.take=LNK1 mathematics‘That teacher uses me to teach maths.’
* ‘That teacher teaches me maths.’teach(chat 112a)Usually, the subject slot does not participate in this semantic-to-syntax-mapping
flexibility. There are, however, rare instances where a participant that would
otherwise have to be expressed in a separate clause can stand in an unoccupied
subject position. The pair in (12) and (13) exemplifies such a case. In the more
normal construction in (12), the verbal complement nama- ‘upwards (RED)’ fills the
verb’s syntactic argument position; as a consequence, the theme participant is
expressed as an object in a separate clause with mei ‘take’ (see § 3.2.3.12.1, p. 203).
In (13), the theme participant of the same complement-verb complex is expressed as
the clause subject. This is visible from the fact that the light verb mei is absent from

"For others, such as isarami ‘brother’ and atanana ‘first’ in (40) above, I have no
indication whatsoever of a separate meaning assignable to any part of the word.
As discussed in § 2.2.3.4 (p. 65), several trisyllabic morphemes contain a long vowel
– one example is puulata ‘head’ in (39) – suggesting that they might be old
compounds with one monosyllabic component. The nucleus of the latter would be
lengthened in order for it to conform to the bimoraicity requirement.
Items longer than two syllables per se meet the bimoraicity requirement.
Grammatical morphemes differ from lexical ones in form: Only lexical, not
grammatical monosyllabic items are required to conform to the bimoraicity
constraint. The majority of grammatical items are either monosyllabic, such as ni
(REFL), hai (NSIT) or =oo ‘too’, or disyllabic, e.g. ani (1s), =ini (LNK1), ere
(1DEM). The former can be both monomoraic, such as ni (REFL), and bimoraic,
such as hai (NSIT). Thus the bimoraicity requirement is a sufficient, but not
necessary, condition for identification of a given morpheme as lexical. In other
words, a lexical morpheme must be bimoraic, but a bimoraic monosyllabic item is
not necessarily a lexical morpheme.
In the domain of lexical morphemes, there seem to be no special correlations
between form and word class. There are nouns, verbs and other word classes among
monosyllabic morphemes; the same holds for disyllabics as well as trisyllabics and
quadrisyllabics (if we choose to accept them as a class in their own right; see the
examples given in (38) through (40) above).",[102]

The term ‘text’ is used in the present thesis to refer to a self-contained stretch of
speech larger than the utterance. The present corpus of recordings mostly consists of
monologues in the form of narratives or procedural texts (see § 1.8, p. 28), hence the
following discussion covers only a limited set of text types and registers. A large
part of the texts in the corpus can be stylistically defined through the presence of an
opening sentence and / or a closing sentence. In an opening sentence, such as (1), the
speaker announces the topic of his narrative (often using a non-canonical word
order, see § 9.2.1, p. 495), while he marks its end with a closing sentence such as
(2).

The non-subjects that are found as in-situ heads of relative sentences are all objects,
rather than complements (§ 5.2, p. 319). No clear instances of multi-clause relative
sentences on in-situ objects have been found. These constructions are much more
clearly distinguishable from their counterparts with left-dislocated heads than those
on subjects, where the distinction is dependent on the presence of an adverbial in a
multi-clause construction. With relative sentences on in-situ objects, the head of the
relative sentence stands in the unmarked object position within its clause, preceded
by its subject and followed by its verb. This structure, as well as the contrasting
structure with a left-dislocated head, are schematically represented in Table 4.3.

not expressed. In fact, (75) is the answer to the question in (76). As such, (75) could
be seen as an elliptical sentence, where a clause expressing the consequence as given
in the question is left unexpressed after uai=konai. A complete version of the
answer, with expression of the consequence clause, would presumably look like
(77).
(76)Ei sa’a-fani’=konai=niei hai muni ma’u?2s what:BD-be.like=CSQ=LNK1 2s NSIT return come‘Why did you come back already?’
(77)Asi-ina=ni(elic1147)hai sopen=isi uai=konai ani hai muni ma’u.1s:POSS-eye=CTR NSIT sleepy=LNK2 CLS=CSQ1sNSIT return come‘I was already sleepy, that is why I came back already.’
Another – though very small – set of rather curious instances is where the normal
time-iconic order of reason and consequence, as found in all previous examples,
does not seem to be maintained. An example is given in (78).
(78)… amuni ki=rial=ee
persontone’uari ma’u (…) fi-lolo-iniATTR=many.HUM=DEF perhaps stillcome1pi-say-NMLMakalero haka=konai iraku-laa (…) so’ot=ini lolo-ini taure’ uari
M.search=CSQ3s-PLwant=LNK1 say-NML whichoko.na ma’en iraku-laa so’ot=ini uere’
not.yetknow3s-PLstillaprende=na’a…want=LNK1 2DEM.V learn=INT‘… many people will perhaps come to look for our Makalero language,
because they (…) want to learn a language that they do not know yet…’
(98-53)
Even though the translation into English using ‘because’ in (78) appears to be in line
with translations for =konai as given so far, this sentence does not tie in with the
meaning proposed here for =konai, which links a first clause, expressing a cause,474CHAPTER 8and a second clause, expressing a consequence of the first clause. In (78), however,
the fact that people might come and look for the Makalero language is not the cause
of them wanting to learn a new language. Rather, the reverse order would be logical,
namely that people’s desire to learn a new language causes them to come and look
for Makalero. To date, only three such ‘reversed’ examples have been found. As
such, this phenomenon can be considered marginal for the time being, though future
research might shed more light on it.","[497, 498, 499]"
"3:UND-hand NSIT ill=LNK2 REFL-hand NSIT lick‘Then the dog’s paw hurts, so he licks it.’(102-107)Thirdly and lastly, =isi is frequently found with clauses giving adverbial
(circumstantial) information. Note that in (26), this adverbial clause is actually
embedded within the constituent parts of the main clause, between its subject kiloo
(3s) and the VP muni ma’u ‘come back’, showing that they form a sentence. While
such adverbial clauses may be said to pertain to the same event as the clause they
modify, they generally conform to the different subject connotation of =isi – in (26),
the subject of the adverbial clause is mu’a ‘ground’ (§ 3.2.3.5, p. 164), while the
third person pronoun kiloo is the agent of the modified clause.
(26)Kiloo mu’a oko nomo kamu=isi muni ma’u.
3sground stillNEGnight=LNK2 return come‘He came home before nightfall.’(elic632)Whereas most cases of clauses linked with =isi are time-iconic, there is a small
number of instances which suggest that the reverse order is possible. This possibility
is also found with the consequence marker =konai (§ 8.1.6, p. 471). (27) is an
example, with (28) showing the more frequent time-iconic way of expression. It is
not quite clear how to account for a case such as (27).
(27)Ani hai
1stafi hau lepuh, aftane’ kamuamuNSIT trueallhungryPTnomo nua-ini=si.early.morning NEGeat-do:BD=LNK2‘I am very hungry because I didn’t eat earlier in the morning.’
(elic1545)

1sPTnomo nua-ini=si hai tafi hau lepuh.early.morning NEGeat-do=LNK2 NSIT true allhungry‘I didn’t eat earlier in the morning, so I am very hungry.’8.1.2 Adversative clause linkage
An adversative relationship between two clauses, in which the second clause is in
some way contrary to the expectation based on the state of affairs expressed in the
first clause, is most often expressed with =po, which is one of the most frequent
clause linkers. (29) gives a typical example.",[486]

but also the arguments of complement VPs (§ 5.2.2.2, p. 326). In (15), for instance,
asi-upa Swiss isi’ ‘my father in Switzerland’ is an argument of the nese- ‘aim at

aim.at:RED-think‘… so my father in Switzerland, I keep thinking about you...’ (106-12)
The fact that the clause’s object is topicalised does not mean, however, that the
subject automatically becomes the focus. Rather, a sentence like (14) contains
multiple topics; the first person narrator is the topic of the whole of the narration,
while lapizeira ‘ballpoint pen’ is the topic under discussion in this specific part of
the narration. Lambrecht (1996: 146ff.) allows for sentences with multiple topics,
claiming that what they assert is the relation between these multiple topics. This
claim seems to apply to such Makalero sentences as (14). The topic-status of the
object is atypical, hence it is made explicit by its position in the LDP. The subject,DISCOURSE STRUCTURE497on the other hand, is in its normal position, clause-initially, as well as in its normal
function, i.e. as a topic.
Lambrecht (1996: 176) introduces a number of topic promotion strategies, which are
“pragmatically motivated structural devices whose basic function is to PROMOTE
referents on the Topic Acceptability Scale from non-active (i.e. brand-new, unused,
or accessible (sic)) to active state in the discourse and hence from lexical to
unaccented pronominal coding in the sentence (…) [The] grammatical function [of
such topic promotion strategies, JH] is to match the requirements of syntactic
structure and information structure in cases where the two do not naturally
coincide.” Typical examples of topic promotion strategies in Makalero are often
seen in text-initial sentences as in (16), where the existence of the topic of the
discourse, the village of Ailebere, is predicated in the very first clause to make it
discourse-active. In the following sentence, it stands as a topic in the LDP.
(16)Ereasi-suku,[suku Ailebere] TOP kuandu uainhira lafu’ aira1DEM 1s:POSS-sucosucorihundouh ru fitu resi-douh=ini lafu’…urasaA.thousand one hundred sixwhenten seven rest-six=LNK1whenliveyearlive‘This is my suco, when the suco of Ailebere was founded in 1676…’
(35-01)
In other cases, the brand-new topic may be directly placed in the LDP, without an
activating clause. An example of this is (17).
(17)Asi-nokoJulieta ki-upa1s:POSS-younger.sibling J.obrigadu roual
thanksuere’=iniani k-asu3:POSS-father 2DEM.V=CTR 1smei=ni3:UND-forkini…many.NONHUM take=LNK1 give.to.3‘My sister Julieta’s father, I thank him much…’(105-001)Whether or not they include an activating clause, text-initial clauses, which
introduce a brand-new referent as a topic to the discourse, are pragmatically very
marked and conspicuously often involve non-canonical word order in Makalero.
A special, quite frequent subtype of topics in the left-detached position are nonargument topics, which play no grammatical role in the sentence that follows them,
but can be said to set a frame for the validity of said sentence. An example is given
in (18).
(18)Ini ki-nuaki-ke’tepana’an.1pe 3:POSS-eat 3:POSS-drink constant NEG.EX‘We had no food or drink.’(101-104)498CHAPTER 99.2.1.2 Foci in the LDP
In (19) and (20), the LDP appears to hold constituents which are part of the focus
(i.e. that part of the proposition by which the assertion differs from the
presupposition, see Lambrecht 1996: 213), rather than topics. Note that in both
cases, the left-dislocated constituent is quite long and complicated. Also, in both
sentences, it is taken up again in the clause it is left-dislocated from in the form of
the resumptives uere or uere’ (§ 3.3.2.1, p. 232, and § 3.2.3.9.1, p. 183).

(81-02, 81-03)510CHAPTER 99.3.2 Lexical parallelism
Lexical parallelism is a phenomenon “widely attested in the oral poetry and elevated
speech of a variety of peoples in the world” (Fox 1988: 1). It involves “a pair of
parallel words, one in each section of the text” (Aronoff and Rees-Miller 2003: 463)
and is commonly supported by syntactic parallelism. Generally, the lexical pairs are
made up of synonyms or words with related meanings and form an ordered,
conventional set. According to Fox (1988: 1), the phenomenon is particularly
prominent in Eastern Indonesia. East Timor and Makalero present no exception to
this. However, lexical parallelism is very much connected to high and / or ritual
registers of speech, and most of the Makalero corpus that forms the basis of the
present study consists of everyday speech. Nevertheless, some instances of lexical
parallels have found their way into everyday speech; other texts, such as clan
histories or accounts of wedding customs, draw heavily on ritualised speech. As
such, the present corpus does allow some insight on lexical parallelism in Makalero.
Lexical parallels in Makalero involve both nouns and verbs; also, full parallel VPs
are found. Parallel pairs of these categories are exemplified in (52), (53) and (54),
respectively, where // is used to indicate the parallel.
(52)omar // lopu‘house’stilt.house // househala // funu‘war’war // war(53)na’an // lesa‘poor’NEG.EX // NEG.havelasi // teri‘cut’cut, chop with a machete // cut with a knife(54)ira pure // ama paun‘work in the field, plantation’work in the paddy // weed the gardenhi’a loke // setur hasa‘clear a way’open a road // demolish a fenceFurthermore, characters and toponyms in ritual stories commonly have parallel
names (see e.g. Engelenhoven 1997). The personal name exemplified in (55) is the
person from whose name the language name Makalero is said to derive, while the
place name comes from an account of the migration route of the Loorasa clan. The
meaning of the majority of the elements found in those names is unclear. Note,
however, that in every case, there appears to be a recurring element, i.e. lero in
Ililero // Laualero and ira in Pusira // Panaira.","[534, 535]"
"402CHAPTER 77.1 Semantics / syntax mismatch
The most important reason to expess an event in the form of a multi-clausal sentence
is a mismatch between the semantic participant structure of the predicate involved
and the rigid syntactic frame dictated by the clause structure. Such cases include, on
the one hand, all states-of-affairs with more than two participants. (1) gives such an
instance: the verb fana ‘teach’ logically involves an agent, a recipient or undergoer,
and a theme. The clause structure as discussed in § 6 (p. 383), however, allows for
the expression of two participants at most. The first argument position is reserved
for the agent-subject. In the case of (1), this is the pronoun ini (1pe).181 The nonsubject argument position of the verb fana ‘teach’ in (1) is occupied by the recipient
ni-mata ere ‘our children’.182 There is no possibility to additionally fit the theme
uere (DEM.DIST) into the clause headed by fana ‘teach’; both its argument
positions are accounted or. Consequently, a separate clause is needed in order for the
theme to be expressed. For this purpose, the verb mei ‘take’ is used. Its sole function
in such clauses as (1) is to provide an open argument position in which to express
the supernumerary participant to the main verb fana ‘teach’. Mei could thus be
called a light verb (see also § 3.2.3.12.1, p. 203). The two clauses share the same
subject.
(1)… ini tone’ uere mei=nini’isini-mataerefana.1pe perhaps 2DEM take=LNK1 simultaneous REFL-child 1DEM teach‘… we will perhaps teach that to our children.’(106-11)The two clauses in (1) are conjoined using the clause linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.2,
p. 249). (2), however, shows that this is optional. In fact, sentence units are among
the few contexts where unmarked clause linking can be found.

"9.1 The determination of grammatical roles
In discourse, the expression of both subject and object participants is in principle
optional (see § 6, p. 383). Either may be omitted if the speaker assumes the hearer
can infer the intended referent from the linguistic or the extra-linguistic context. It
follows that in a sequence of an NP and a transitive verb, it is not necessarily clear
which function the NP has within the clause: since both the subject and the nonsubject arguments are preverbal, an NP preceding a transitive verb could
theoretically be either its subject, with an unexpressed object as in (3), or an object
or complement argument with its verb (or, in other words, a full VP) as in (4). In
either case, Ø marks the locus of the omitted constituent.

as well as some strategies which help with the correct interpretation of grammatical
roles. Note, however, that these are strong tendencies rather than absolute rules.
In a sequence of clauses in running text, the default organising principle is subject or
topic continuity; the subject referent is most commonly the same over a chain of
clauses and is left unexpressed. A change of subject, being a departure from this
rule, requires explicit mention. As such, an NP preceding a transitive verb is
generally interpreted as the verb’s object. This principle is illustrated in the sequence
in (5), where a constant subject referent is left unexpressed after the initial clause.
The following clauses are invariably of the form OV; the position of the
unexpressed subject is marked by Ø in those clauses.

"7.7.3.2.1 Hai rau ‘it is good’
Hai rau literally translates as ‘it is good / okay’. It is sometimes found preceding the
actual imperative VP. Note that where it cooccurs with an overtly expressed
addressee, it follows that addressee. Its function appears to be the softening of a
direct order. Examples are given in (132) and (133).",[472]
"7.7.3.3 Imperative particles
Two clausal clitics, =uai and =elo, have been found to mark imperatives. They are
discussed in § 7.7.3.3.1 (p. 449) and § 7.7.3.3.2 (p. 450), respectively. Again, these
constructions appear very rarely in the recorded corpus, for which reason I dispense
with intonation curves.7.7.3.3.1 =uai on imperatives
=uai on imperatives appears to be the same element that marks questions (§ 7.7.2.1,
p. 438) and is used by some speakers on declaratives as well (see § 7.7.1, p. 435). It
is thus a very multifunctional device. If cliticised to the right end of an imperative, it
serves to make the imperative more polite; in fact, one speaker characterised (140)
as closer to a request than an order.

=elo, too, is found cliticised to the right end of an imperative sentence. Again, it
considerably softens the order. One speaker suggested its use was more typical with
the younger generations. Note that after the verb pane ‘wash’ in (142), the final
vowel of which is identical to the initial vowel of the clitic, =elo loses its initial
vowel. It is not quite clear if the same happens when =elo is cliticised to elements
ending in vowels other than /e/.

No other marking combinations have been found so far.

"81Its Makasae cognate is -kini, with the same syllables in reversed order. This might suggest that the form
is a compound of two elements, ki and ni. Another possible cognate is kina, the prenominal plural marker
for the noun moko ‘child’ in Fataluku. However, it is difficult to account for its prenominal position as
compared to the postnominal position of its putative Makalero and Makasae cognates.
82
In Makasae, the possible cognate -kai appears to be used with personal names, too. There is no such
example in my Makalero database, although it was not specifically tested.",[143]
"304CHAPTER 4As shown to be the case in the above sections (§ 4.3.5.1.1, p. 297, and § 4.3.5.1.2,
p. 299), it is an option to have not only the subject of the relative sentence, but also
its left-most element, the adverbial predicate, marked by the =ua-marker. Precisely
this is the case too with in-situ subjects preceded by adverbials: the clitic =ua can be
attached to both the adverbial as well as the subject. In cases like (116) and (117),
thus, the first =ua on the adverbial predicate shows it to stand within the relative
modifier. The subject, which is the head of the construction, follows this adverbial
and is marked by another =ua.

"LEXICAL CATEGORIES2473.5.2.3 =o(u) ‘or’
=o(u) ‘or’ is a Portuguese-based conjunction found in the coordination of clauses
and of NPs. It is identical in meaning to the native Makalero clitic =uai (§ 3.5.2.2,
p. 246) and is relatively rare. Its realisation fluctuates between that of a free element
and a clitic, with some speakers preferring one and others the other realisation. (435)
shows a use of =o(u) as a clitic, while in (436), it is a free element. In this latter use,
o(u) ‘or’ probably groups with the other Portuguese-based conjunctions, which are
likely verbal, as discussed in § 3.6.5.1 (p. 269).

=hi’a ‘only’ is most commonly cliticised to NPs, as illustrated in (437), but can also
be used on clauses, as shown in (438).

(115-049)3.5.2.5 The linker =ini
=ini is the single most common phrase-level clitic. It is found both on NPs and on
clauses, though it is functionally quite different, depending on the phrase level it is
used on. § 3.5.2.5.1 (p. 248) briefly describes =ini on NP-level, while § 3.5.2.5.2
(p. 249) treats the clitic on clause level. In either case, if cliticised to a vowel-final248CHAPTER 3element, =ini commonly loses its first vowel, being realised as =ni (see e.g. (439)
below). In rapid speech, the final vowel may be elided as well, as a result of which
the clitic may be realised only as [n].3.5.2.5.1 =ini on NP-level
The principle function of the clitic =ini on an NP is the marking of that NP’s
referent as contrasting with another possible referent. A typical example is given in
(439).
(439)… amuni ki=rial=ee
personso’ot=ini dame=na’a=po ini=niATTR=many.HUM=DEF want=LNK1 peace=INT=ADVR 1pe=CTRnomo so’ot...
NEGwant‘… many people want to make peace, but we don’t want that…’ (81-12)
A more detailed description of =ini’s use as a contrastive marker follows in
§ 9.2.3.1 (p. 501).
From a contrastive marker which can be found on NPs in both subject and object
function, =ini appears to be evolving into a subject marker. Concretely, it is found
as a subject marker in three types of context; the first involves long NPs which may
be considered hard to process. In such a case, =ini marks the end of the subject NP
and indicates that the verb phrase follows. (440) gives such an example. In the
second instance, =ini is used when the order of subject and object is reversed, as in
(441). In such a sentence, =ini is vital for a correct understanding of grammatical
roles. Finally, =ini marks untypical subjects (i.e. subjects that are low on the topicworthiness hierarchy) such as the indefinite NP in (442). See § 6.2.1 (p. 389) for
more details.

"NSIT good move‘… go!’(120-071)7.7.3.2.2 =te’e ‘after’
=te’e is actually a clause linker expressing completion of the action of the first
clause before the onset of the action of the following clause (§ 3.5.3.1.1.3, p. 252).
With imperatives, it attaches to a simple sentence (with no follow-up, as would be
expected of a clause linker). However, it can be read as implying a following action,
along the lines of ‘do x first, before you…’. The effect of the use of =te’e is similar
to that of hai rau, in that it softens the order and makes it more polite.

In a few cases, an element kini is found with imperatives. Notably, all of the
sentences in question involve an overt second person singular addressee. Kini, the
exact nature of which is hard to determine due to the scarcity of examples, is
homophonous with the indirect information marker =kini (§ 3.5.3.1.2.2, p. 258) as
well as with the verb kini ‘do’. It always follows the second person singular pronoun
ei, as shown in (136) and (137).

First person plural cohortatives, equivalent to English ‘let’s’, are generally formed
with the movement verb ma’u ‘come’. Two examples are given below.
(138)Ma’u fi duka!
come 1pi play.cards‘Let’s play cards!’
(139)(elic285)Ma’u fi Makalero lolo!
come 1pi M.say‘Let’s speak Makalero!’(Pinto 2007, title)Such structures are only found in elicitated sentences (as (138)), or in the unnatural
setting of a written grammar sketch, as (139). Hence it is quite possible that this
structure is actually a calque on one of the contact languages used. In the latter case,
this would be an identical structure in Tetum (with mai ‘come’, see Hull and Eccles
2001: 129), and for the former mari in the contact language Indonesian (see
Sneddon 1996: 332).","[473, 474]"
"NSIT take come‘… (I) bought two metres of cloth, and then he brought it here.’
(73-31)
The comparison with such examples as (62) and (64) in § 3.1.3.5 (p. 120) above
shows that there is no grammatical difference between the construction of count
nouns with classifiers and that of mass nouns with units of measurement. There is
thus little evidence for a separate class of mass nouns; they behave very much like
those nouns that are compatible with classifiers. Together, they contrast with the
nouns denoting larger animals and objects for which there are no classifiers.
Rijkhoff (2002: 50) defines four language-specific types of nouns on the basis of
their behaviour in combination with numerals. One of these is the singular object
noun, which stands in a direct construction with a numeral. This type of noun is
found in many European languages. It appears that Makalero nouns denoting larger
objects, for which there are no classifiers, might be counted among such singular
object nouns. Another of Rijkhoff’s (2002: 50) noun types is the sort noun, with
which the numeral combines with a sortal classifier. Though the use of classifiers is
not obligatory in Makalero, nouns denoting smaller objects, and possibly mass
nouns, seem to conform to the definition of sort nouns.
The distinction in Makalero between two classes of nouns, one which can be
individuated directly, and one which needs a classifier-like element for the purpose,
is similar to the distinction between count nouns and mass nouns found in many
European languages. The classification of nouns into either of these two classes
follows clearly different principles.",[148]
"REFL-child take good-beat‘… (he) beat up his child thoroughly.’(52-12)It is thus grammatical for a VP to contain either an object or a complement. Despite
their distinct positions within the VP and the different degrees of fusion they
undergo with the verb, either of these fill the non-subject argument position
associated with the verb. All contexts which involve either more than one participant
next to the agent, or both an undergoer and such adverbial information as normally
expressed by verbal complements, must be constructed as multi-clause units, or
sentences (§ 7, p. 401).
Interestingly, a large part of verbal complements express adverbial notions of
location or manner. Being in most cases non-obligatory specifications to an action
(but see § 3.2.3.1.2.1, p. 145, for cases where they are obligatory), they would most
commonly be classified as adjuncts rather than as arguments. It is a rather unusual
trait for adjuncts to exhibit a degree of fusion with the verb not encountered with
prototypical arguments (i.e. objects), as is the case in Makalero. Consequently, the
reality of a distinction between arguments and adjuncts is dubitable.
Objects arguments are only found with a specific class of verbs the semantic
participant frame of which includes an undergoer (i.e. transitive verbs). For
illustration, (86) shows a prototypical undergoer object.
(86)… na’u tepa
just[afi-seur]OBJ nua.constant fish-meateat‘… (we) kept eating fish.’(101-258)Similarly, not every verb is compatible with a nominal complement (see, for
instance, § 3.2.3.13, p. 210, on movement verbs). Whether or not it can appear with
a nominal complement appears to be a lexical property of a given verb. (87) shows a
typical example of a movement verb which expresses the goal as a nominal
complement.
(87)Ini meih
1pe[mu’a] COMPL-isa...two.HUM ground-go.down‘We got down to the ground...’(113-07)Verbal complements, on the other hand, can appear with any type of verb, including
both those that are compatible with object arguments (i.e. semantically transitive
verbs) and those that are not. The example in (88) shows two stative verbs, kel
‘hard’ and maka’ ‘firm’, both of which do not have an inherent locative component.
Nevertheless, both stand with a deictic verbal complement ue-, the reduced form of
the addressee-related deictic verb ue’ (§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180). Til ‘noon’ in (89), on the
other hand, is one of a group of time of day and weather verbs with fixed subjects
(§ 3.2.3.5, p. 164). The example shows that, even though these verbs occur only in a
very restricted sort of structure, they can nevertheless take VP complements.",[363]
"3.1.2.2 Reduplication
Reduplication is one of the few truly productive morphological processes in
Makalero. In several cases, nouns are derived from other nouns or verbs by means of
reduplication. In all instances, the stem is fully reduplicated. Note, however, that the
final consonant of a morpheme ending in a closed syllable is omitted in the
reduplicant. An example is sera-seran ‘things, stuff’, which is a reduplication of
seran ‘stuff’. § 2.3.1 (p. 70) proposes that coda consonants are extrasyllabic in order
to account for this behaviour.
The verb-to-noun derivations in (28) and (29) are thematically grouped. The verbs in
(28) denote actions associated with specific instruments. In these cases, the derived
noun refers to that instrument. The examples in (29), on the other hand, denote an
abstract notion derived from a verb (with the exception of nua-nua ‘food’, a
concrete noun).",[131]
"306CHAPTER 44.3.5.3 Relative sentences with unexpressed subjects
Some speakers like to leave third person pronominal subjects unexpressed, both in
main clauses as well as in clausal modifiers. Obviously, in cases where such a
subject is unexpressed, the most common relative sentence marking strategy of
cliticising =ua to the relative sentence subject is not available. (121) and (122) show
such sentences, where, in the absence of an overt subject NP, only the object, which
is the head of the modifier clause, takes the =ua marker.
(121)[Mu’u=ua [teuh]MOD ere] NP hai ki=popo.
banana=REL buy1DEMNSIT ATTR=rotten‘The bananas (he) bought are already rotten.’
(122)(elic317)[Osan=ua [soohe’ ani-asu manin]MOD ere]NP hai hau hai’.
money=REL yesterday 1s-forgive.to.me1DEMNSIT allfinished‘The money that (he) gave me yesterday is already finished.’ (elic096)
Such sentences structurally look like as the relative sentences in (96) and (97) above,
which relativise on the subject argument of a semantically intransitive verb; (97) is
repeated here as (123).
(123)… lolo-ini ki=raumei (…) [noko-raa=[uasay-NML ATTR=good takeaite’lafu’]MODyounger.sibling-PL=REL REC.PT liveere]NP ki-e-isi-lolo.
1DEM3:POSS-chest-at:RED-say‘… advise our younger siblings who were just born well.’ (lit. speak good
words to the hearts of our siblings…’
(98-24)
Compare also the relative sentences in (99) and (100), where the head is a transitive
verb’s subject. Relative sentences such as in (121) differ from constructions such as
in (123) through the fact that their verb is compatible with an undergoer participant,
and from such clauses as (99) and (100), in which both the subject and the object
arguments are overt, through the absence of an object NP.
The constructions in (121) and (122) contradict the general rule that =ua-marking is
centred on the subject, i.e. that a single =ua is attached to the subject of the relative
sentence. As such, their interpretation appears potentially problematic. I assume it is
mainly the semantics which make the interpretation clear; denoting inanimate
objects, these relative clause heads are unlikely to carry out actions such as buying
in (121) or giving in (122), but make good undergoers.","[330, 331]"

The combination of the clause linkers =po (ADVR) and =konai(=ni) (CSQ=LNK1)

"76CHAPTER 22.5.1 Bimoraicity
The minimum lexical morpheme must be at least bimoraic. The vast majority of
morphemes are disyllabic, consisting of two light syllables. Each of these syllables
weighs one mora; the total weight of the morpheme is, consequently, two morae.
Some examples of such morphemes are given in (37).
(37)hu.ri
ua.li
da.kar
ru.kit‘release’
‘ear’
‘step’
‘curly (hair)’The form of the prototypical Makalero morpheme is CVCV(C). The CVCV pattern
is a pervasive feature in the languages of Eastern Indonesia (see Klamer 2002: 5).
As such, the presence of words of the form CVCVC seems remarkable; § 2.5.4
(p. 80) on echo vowels, however, shows that in practice, closed syllables are
relatively rare and generally avoided.
The bimoraicity requirement also applies for monosyllabic lexical items; it has been
stated above (§ 2.2.3.2, p. 64) that such morphemes must be made up of a heavy
syllable with a complex nucleus. A morpheme with a diphthong nucleus conforms to
the bimoraicity requirement since its nucleus is complex and consists of two
elements, the vowel and the glide. Each of these components is assigned its own
mora. § 2.2.3 (p. 62) argues that long vowels are in most instances allophones of
short vowels rather than phonemes in their own right, on the ground of their
predictable occurrence. Hence it can be assumed that such morphemes as [du:r]
‘wake up’ and and [ni:] ‘mother’ are actually, on the phonemic level, /dur/ and /ni/.
On the phonetic level, in contrast, their nuclei are lengthened in order for them to
meet the bimoraicity requirement, as illustrated below.
(38)μμμμ→
/d
u
‘wake up’
μr/[d
u:
‘ibid.’μμr]
μ→
/n
i/
‘mother’[n
i:]
‘ibid.’The bimoraicity requirement is strictly on the morpheme level and is not affected if
the morphemes in question are part of a larger phonological phrase. Thus, even with
suffixes and clitics, such lexical items as dur ‘wake up’ and ni ‘mother’ retain the
long vowel nucleus.
Apart from mono- and disyllabic items, there is also a number of trisyllabic lexical
morphemes, as exemplified in (39).","[100, 101]"
