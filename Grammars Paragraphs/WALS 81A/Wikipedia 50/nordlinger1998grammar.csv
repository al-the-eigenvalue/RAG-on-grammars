iniliAuxiliaries with objects contain the same subject bound pronouns and tense suffixes as in
the charts above (Wambaya is the only member of the Eastern Group that has a different
system of tense marking in these auxiliaries than in auxiliaries without objects; see §5.2.1).
In all languages/dialects third person object is not overtly expressed in the auxiliary and object
bound pronouns register person only. The object bound pronouns in all languages/ dialects
are: ng(V) `first person object' and ny(V) `second person object'.
The only significant difference among auxiliaries with objects in the Eastern Group
languages is in the ordering of object bound pronouns and tense suffixes. The usual order is

"CHAPTER 7SYNTAX OF SIMPLE SENTENCESWambaya has two basic clause types (divided according to their predicators): verbal and
nominal (or verbless). A verbal clause has a finite verb as predicate and, except for under
certain discourse conditions (see §5.4), always requires the presence of the auxiliary.
Nominal clauses, on the other hand, have either nominal predicates or predicates consisting
of a purposive non-finite subordinate clause and cannot contain an auxiliary. A simple
sentence consists of a single clause of either type. I will begin with a discussion of verbless
clauses — those with nominal predicates — and will then discuss verbal clauses in §7.2. Nonfinite subordinate clauses are discussed in §8.1.
7.1 VERBLESS CLAUSES
For the purposes of this study I will assume verbless clauses to consist of a subject and a
(usually nominal) predicate.' Note that `subject' in this context, in which it is opposed to
`predicate', is used differently than in verbal clauses, in which it is opposed to `object'.
Verbless clauses do not contain an auxiliary, and therefore do not indicate tense. The tense
of these clauses is usually taken to be the same tense as the rest of the discourse or, if uttered
in isolation, present tense. If it is necessary for a verbless clause to be marked for past or
future tense, it can be made into a verbal clause with the use of mina `sit, be' and thereby
contain an auxiliary. The use of mina as a type of `copula' verb is discussed in §7.1.7.
As with other types of sentences, word order in verbless clauses is relatively free; the
subject can precede (example (7-1)) or follow (7-5) the predicate, or can be discontinuous (74). The subjects of these clauses are often modified (or represented) by a demonstrative that
can mark definiteness and therefore emphasise the subject. In all verbless clauses, the subject
must be in the nominative case. In ascriptive and having/lacking verbless clauses, the
predicate must also be in the nominative case and agree with the subject in both gender and
number.
7.1.1 ASCRIPTTVE CLAUSES
The predicate of an ascriptive clause attributes a certain property to the subject. The
predicate can be an adjective (examples (7-1) and (7-2)); a full noun phrase (7-3); a nominal
inflected with an adnominal suffix, such as the `origin' suffix (7-4); or a nominal derived
with the agentive or pri vative suffixes ((7-5) and (7-6)). Both subject and predicate must
agree in case (nominative), gender and number.","[190, 191]"
"12Chapter Ilanguages which are not prefixing in at least the verbal domain a re the Tangkic languages,
such as Kayardild and Lardil.3
The four genders in Wambaya are masculine (Class I), feminine (Class II), vegetable
(Class III) and neuter (Class Iv). Class membership is primarily semantically based. There are
two series of gender suffixes: those which occur in the nominative and accusative cases
(absolutive) and those which occur in all other cases (non-absolutive).4 Gender is marked on
nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and some indefinite/interrogatives.
Wambaya is a `split-ergative' language: nominals (excluding free pronouns) have an
ergative-absolutive pattern of inflection while the free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
declension. Following Goddard (1982), the class of nominals as a whole is analysed as
having a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative and accusative (see §4.4).
A second position auxiliary, obligatorily present in most Wambaya clauses, contains
bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause. This auxiliary
also contains most of the tense, aspect and mood information for the clause, and can contain
directional affixes indicating movement towards or away from the speaker. Unusually, the
auxiliary has no root.
Some further unusual aspects of Wambaya grammar include: a subjective/objective
distinction that is made by some adjectives (see §3.1), a suffix found with kinship nominals
which appears to have a reflexive possessive function (see §4.5.1.2) and some verbs which
alternate in transitivity without changing their form (see §7.2.7).
As is common for Australian languages, Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and
the word order is relatively free.
1.1.1 THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGES
The West Barkly language family consists of 5 languages/dialects: Jingili, Ngarnga (or
Ngarnji), Wambaya, Gudanji and Binbinka. The structure of this family can be represented
as in Table 1.1 (following Chadwick 1978:2).

5Although the Tangkic languages were originally classified by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) as
Pama-Nyungan, recent discussions (namely Evans (1985, 1988, 1995a) and Blake (1988, 1990)) have
shown them to be clearly non-Pama-Nyungan.
These gender suffixes are then followed by the appropriate case suffix.
The terms 'Eastern Group' and 'McArthur' are taken from Chadwick (e.g. 1978).","[19, 20]"
"23 Note that the corresponding Yukulta term has the same form: yaka narri (McConvell (1985:29) citing
Sharp).
24 I am not completely sure about the order of these two choices; they may go the other way around.",[30]
"Parts of speech and other preliminaries533.1.2.2 PARTICLES
There are only a few particles in Wambaya. Particles have grammatical functions, such as
marking yes/no interrogative clauses, marking negation in declarative and imperative clauses,
and linking two finite clauses into a single complex clause. They are formally distinguished
from adverbs as they have strict positional restrictions: particles almost always occur in initial
position. Particles are discussed in §7.7.2.
3.1.2.3 arms
Clitics can be distinguished from other non-inflecting word classes as they are bound
forms; they can not stand alone as words.10 There are three clitics in the corpus: =miji, =nima
and =minyi. Miji (glossed INFER') expresses epistemic mood; it indicates that the speaker
considers the proposition to be probable or possible, but does not know for sure whether or
not it is actual. It is an unrestricted clitic and is always encliticised to the initial word of the
clause. Nîma (glossed `NST') can usually be translated by English words such as `just',
`only' and `still', although in some examples it seems to have an emphatic function. It is a
restricted clitic which usually occurs with nominals, although it can also occur with verbs and
other word classes. The other clitic, =minyi (glossed `AGAIN'), is used only with verbs. It is
encliticised to the verb over which it has scope. These three clitics are discussed and
exemplified in §7.7.1.
3.1.2.4 INTERJECTIONS
There are only a small number of interjections in Wambaya. Interjections can constitute a
complete utterance on their own and are therefore distinguished from word classes such as
adverbs and particles. Examples of interjections in Wambaya include gunku `I/we don't
know', guyala `no, nothing' and alima `OK, goodbye'.
Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
`Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
§7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.","[70, 71]"

NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PRI suspect that the basic use of wayî is in yes/no questions when the speaker is anticipating
a negative reply, and that examples such as (7-145) and (7-146) could probably have been
explained in this way in the contexts in which they were given. The information question
associated with (7-143) could arise for pragmatic reasons: if the speaker asks the question
Aren't you listening? then it might be expected that he/she is also looking for an explanation
why. However, further research is required in order to test this hypothesis and more
accurately determine the meaning of this particle and the contexts of its use.
7.5.2 INFORMATION QUESTIONS
These questions involve the use of an indefinite/interrogative, usually initial in the clause,
that indicates the nature of the information being sought. As in many Australian languages,
indefinite/interrogatives in Wambaya can be used either in interrogative function (e.g. `who',
`what') or as indefinite pronouns (e.g. `someone', `something'). They contain one of five
basic roots: gayinî- `what, who'; inja- `where, which'; yangula `when'; yangulanji `how
19 Based on the forms of the auxiliaries and the negative particles he recorded, as well as some of the lexical
items.",[216]
"54Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of subcategorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically nontransparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
(1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
(usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The subcategorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
indicating the source or the direction of the motion).","[71, 72]"

7.2.2.4 NGARLWI `TALK (LANGUAGE) (TO IO)'
Ngarlwi is unique in that it subcategorises for a nominative subject NP and two optional
object arguments: an accusative object referring to the language spoken (usually called a
cognate object, e.g. Austin 1982) and a dative indirect object. It can, therefore, appear in four
different case frames, the most of any verb in the corpus: simple intransitive (example (7-184Chapter 758)), intransitive with cognate object (7-59), semitransitive (7-60), and semitransitive with
cognate object (7-61).11

"3.2.2 DEFINING SUBJECT, OBJECT AND INDIRECT OBJECT
Following are the properties by which subjects, objects and indirect objects can be
characterised and identified in Wambaya.
SUBJECT I7(i)Subject NPs take either the ergative case (A) or the nominative case (S).(ii)In a main verbal clause or a finite subordinate clause, the subject is represented by a
bound pronoun in the first position in the auxiliary.(iii)In a non-finite subordinate clause the subject is the pivot and is obligatorily omitted,
being identical to a core argument of the main clause (see §8.1).(iv)In a simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
nominal suffix -nî, the main-clause subject is that which is co-referential with the
(omitted) subordinate-clause subject.(v)In a reduced adjoined clause the subject is the pivot and is omitted, being coreferential with the subject of the preceding clause (see §8.2).1816 I have not tested the limits of these combinations. For example, what is the limit on the number of noncore functions that can occur within a clause? And is it possible to have the complete set of dative
functions within the one clause? Consider, for example, 'I talked to the woman (indirect object) about
language (complement) for money (adjunct)'.
17 Note that this discussion does not help to identify or define the properties of a subject in a verbless
clause. There are often difficulties with formally identifying the subject in such clauses (e.g. see Morphy
(1983) on Djapu). Verbless clauses are discussed in §7.I.
18 In a non-reduced adjoined clause, the subject can be identified from the auxiliary by (ii).",[74]

In the above examples the subordinate clause follows the main clause. When the
subordinate clause describes an event which immediately precedes and causes that described
by the main clause, the temporal adjunct often precedes the main clause. In these
constructions, the subordinate clause is marked with a fall—rise intonation and is separated
from the main clause by a pause:

to be distinguished on the basis of such things as tense/mood sequences and differences in word order.
More Wambaya data is needed before it can be determined whether such things are also significant in
these clauses in Wambaya.
15 Note that the auxiliary of the second clause has been omitted here. This is . reasonably common,
especially with coordinate clauses; see §8.2.2 below.",[236]
"While there are other other verbs that occur with cognate objects (see §7.2.5.2), ngarlwi is
unique in that in clauses with the cognate object, the subject remains nominative and is
registered by an `intransitive subject' bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Other verbs taking
cognate objects, such as nijbi `sing (a song)' take ergative subjects which are registered by
`transitive subject' bound pronouns, when they occur in that case frame.
7.2.2.5 INTRANSITIVE VERBS IN NOUN + VERB IDIOMS
Two intransitive verbs belong to idioms in which they are combined with a nominative
noun which has an adverbial-type function. The two such noun + verb idioms found in the
corpus are:

"Nijbi can also be used intransitively; see §7.2.7.
Other verbs in the corpus also take cognate objects. These include ngarlwî `speak
(language)'; which differs from ngarlu and nijbi in taking a nominative subject despite the
presence of the object (see §7.2.2.4), and didima `tell O (story) to I0' which is exemplified in
the discussion of ditransitive verbs below.",[207]
"3.1.1.3 AUXILIARY
The auxiliary is a fundamental constituent of Wambaya grammar. Its presence is
obligatory in every main verbal clause9 and most finite subordinate clauses. The auxiliary
contains most of the important grammatical information for the clause. It contains bound
pronouns which represent the core arguments of the clause and affixes which indicate tense,
aspect and mood. Although limited tense information is marked on the verb, that contained in
the auxiliary is usually more detailed and informative. Furthermore, there is some information
(such as habitual aspect and hypothetical mood) which is only ever marked on the auxiliary,
never on the verb. The auxiliary can also contain directional suffixes which indicate whether
the action described by the verb occurs in a direction away from or towards the speaker. The
auxiliary almost always occurs in second position in the clause. A detailed discussion of the
auxiliary and its component parts is found in Chapter 5.
Phonologically, the auxiliary has some unusual characteristics. It is the only grammatical
word in Wambaya which can be monosyllabic, and the only word which can have a final
consonant. For the purposes of stress, a polysyllabic auxiliary constitutes a separate stress
domain, while a monosyllabic auxiliary cliticises to the preceding word and does not bear
stress (see §2.2.4).",[70]
"180Chapter 7constructions, in which case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary
with the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun (see §5.1.1 and below).
Table 7.1 shows the possible basic argument structures for verbs in Wambaya. Discussion
and examples of the different types follow the table. The finite clause complements of verbs
such as dîdîma `tell O that SCOMP', ngajbi `see that SCOMP', tunga `hear, remember that
SCOMP' are discussed in §8.2.1.3. Adjuncts and semantically restricted complements were
covered in the discussion of case marking in §4.4.

Impersonal verbs in Wambaya are characterised by the fact that they cannot co-occur with
an overt subject NP although a (third person singular) subject bound pronoun is always
present in the auxiliary. There are three impersonal verbs in the corpus. Two of these, ngajirri
`be cold' and ngarrangarra `be hot', are impersonal only when they are used with reference to
the weather. They have another use as simple intransitive verbs, in which case they take a
nominative subject NP and are not impersonal. An example of their impersonal use is:89Subject and object arguments are always registered in the auxiliary, and thus the argument NPS are often
omitted (especially if first or second person). Other arguments can also be ellipsed under certain discourse
conditions, although these conditions are not yet well understood.
This is a purposive non-finite subordinate clause. It usually consists of just a verb inflected with the
dative case, but can also contain NP arguments (see example (7-50)). A few verbs in the corpus can
optionally take a purposive complement instead of a nominal argument (see below).","[197, 198]"

Although these two reduplication patterns account for most of the reduplicated forms in
Wambaya, there are a few other forms which are reduplicated in slightly different ways. In a
couple of examples the reduplicated form is derived by copying the last two syllables of the
word to the right:
ya.rru.bu.rdu
garr.ga.lyiwalk around > ya.rru.bu.rdu-bu.rdu

iligirra river > ililirriboys
riversCHAPTER 3PARTS OF SPEECH AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES3.1 PARTS OF SPEECH
There are seven parts of speech (or `word classes') in Wambaya, determined by the
inflectional and distributional characteristics of each word. These classes are mutually
exclusive:1 each root belongs to only one word class, although with the use of derivational
suffixes, it is possible for a root to move its membership from one word class to another.
These derivational suffixes are discussed in §4.5.2 (verb to nominal) and §6.2.2 (nominal to
verb). The seven parts of speech in Wambaya are:
(1)NOMINALS(i) nouns
(ii) adjectives
(iii) free pronouns
(iv) demonstratives
(v) locational nominals
(vi) temporal nominals
(vii) indefinite/interrogatives

CLITICS
INTERJECTIONSOf these seven word classes, the two largest and most important are the open classes of
verbs and nominals. These two classes have quite distinct morphological and syntactic
characteristics. Nominals generally inflect for gender, number and case and usually function
as the arguments of the clause.2 Verbs on the other hand are inflected for tense, co-occur with
the auxiliary and typically function as the predicate of the clause. Both classes also have
different derivational possibilities. Although word-class membership is determined primarily
on grammatical and functional grounds such as these, it is also possible to characterise the
difference between these two word classes on semantic grounds: verbs typically describe
states, actions and events, and nominals usually denote entities, objects and attributes.3
In the following discussion I divide the word classes into `inflecting' (nominals, verbs and
the auxiliary) and `non-inflecting' (adverbs, particles, clitics and interjections).","[63, 64]"
"7.2 VERBAL CLAUSES: BASIC ARGUMENT STRUCTURES
In this section I discuss basic verbal clauses in terms of their main verb and the core
arguments that it subcategorises for: subject, (direct and second) object, indirect object and
subject complements. In §3.2 I outlined the criteria by which these different argument types
can be identified in Wambaya. Some aspects of this discussion, namely the distinctions
between the different types of objects,. are worth reviewing here.
(i) Direct objects are distinguished from second objects and indirect objects as they are
registered on the auxiliary with an object bound pronoun.
(ii) Second objects are found with a very small set of ditransitive verbs which also take a
direct object (see §7.2.1.5). Like direct objects, second objects are always marked with
accusative case and are thereby distinguished from indirect objects. Unlike direct
objects, second objects can never be registered in the auxiliary.
(iii) Indirect objects are not registered with an object bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Nor
are they marked with accusative case. In fact, indirect objects are almost always marked
with the dative case, the one exception being the allative indirect object of yardi 'put'.
Like other core functions, indirect objects are semantically unrestricted: their
interpretation depends on the verb with which they occur. Furthermore, unlike other
complements and adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal
As has been pointed out to me by Bill McGregor and Lesley Stirling (pers comm.). it is not surprising
that a verbless clause will have an objective meaning and a verbal clause a subjective meaning. In
verbless clauses the speaker is imputing a quality upon the subject (i.e. 'objective') and in verbal clauses
the speaker is describing a situation, event or state (such as that of 'feeling').",[197]
"More work is needed in order to properly determine the meaning an d function of this
suffix. For the purposes of this work I will refer to it as a progressive marker (and gloss it
`PROG'), although this may not turn out to be the best characterisation of its meaning and
function.
5.2.4 IRREALIS MOOD
There are three suffixes that are used in the auxiliary to encode different types of irrealis
mood. The `non-actual' suffixes are used to express irrealis events in the past and present
tenses and are discussed in §5.2.4.1. The `hypothetical' suffix marks hypothetical future
tense constructions; events that are conceivable or possible, but not cert ain. This suffix is
discussed in §5.2.4.2.

investigation is required.",[166]
"CHAPTER 5THE AUXILIARYThe auxiliary in Wambaya contains bound pronouns that represent the subject and object
(if present) of the clause, as well as affixes that provide tense, aspect, mood and directional
information. The auxiliary occurs in second position an d is usually obligatory in every main
verbal clause; it can be omitted only under highly restricted conditions (see §5.4). The basic
structure of the auxiliary is as follows:
Subject + (Object) + Tense/aspect/mood/directional
A maximum of two arguments can be registered in the auxiliary: the subject and the direct
object.' With ditransitive verbs it is the recipient which is registered. In all examples in the
corpus, this argument is animate while the other argument that is not registered is inanimate.2
Some examples are:
(5-1)marranya.
Didima ngiyi-ng-a
3SG.NM.A-IO-NF yarn.IV(ACC)
tell
She told me a yarn.","[154, 155]"
"The ablative case suffix -nnga is used in prior clauses (examples (8-7), (8-8)) (the few
examples of this type of clause in the corpus all have co-referential subjects). These canDench and Evans (1988:30) argue that the use of what appears to be the locative case suffix to mark
same subject occurs only in languages in which this suffix also marks ergative case and can therefore be
seen to have arisen through a system of antecedant agreement with a main clause ergative subject, rather
than being related to a locative function. Thus initially it would have appeared only in subordinate
clauses controlled by main clause ergative subjects, and would then have extended to all subjectcontrolled subordinate clauses. While this may explain the development of this pattern of marking in
languages such as Wambaya, in which ergative and locative functions are marked with one case suffix, it
does not explain the use of the locative suffix to mark same subject in languages such as Jingili
(Chadwick 1975) and Bilinara (Nordlinger 1990), in which ergative case and locative case are marked with
separate suffixes.
In this chapter I will use square brackets to identify the subordinate clause.
An alternative analysis of these clauses with perception verbs is to treat them as object complements,
analogous to the subject complements of certain intransitive verbs discussed in §7.2.2.",[231]
"The auxiliary139Appendix C gives the forms of the auxiliaries in the other Eastern Group languages (from
Chadwick 1978)_
5.1 BOUND PRONOUNS
Every auxiliary (except for some directional imperative auxiliaries — see §5.3) must contain
a bound pronoun that registers the subject of the clause, and if there is a first or second
person object, then the auxiliary must also contain a bound pronoun registering the object of
the clause. (Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. This is discussed in more
detail in §5.2.1.) The presence of bound pronouns in the auxiliary means that it is possible,
and indeed usual, to omit the overt NP if all the necessary information is included in the
bound pronoun itself, or if it is evident from context or previous discourse.
The bound pronoun system as a whole makes a three-way distinction between transitive
subject (A), intransitive subject (S) and transitive object (0) (Table 5.1), although it is only in.
the third person singular that all three core functions are formally distinguished; all other
bound pronouns have homophonous A and S forms. While the subject bound pronouns
register person and number, object bound pronouns register person only. When the object is
non-singular, the appropriate accusative free pronoun is used to indicate the number of the
object (see below).

These examples appear to have the intonational contour of single clauses and thus, are not
analysable as coordinate clauses along the lines of those discussed in §8.2.2. However, at
this stage of the investigation, such a distinction is based on purely impressionistic grounds
and needs to be confirmed by structural and semantic evidence that these examples contain a
single clause while those in §8.2.2 do not. For example, future tense examples are needed in
order to find out which verb (if not both) is inflected with the verbal future tense suffix. If
only one verb can be inflected, this would be strong evidence that the two belong to a single
clause; conversely if both verbs are inflected, this may suggest that they are in separate
clauses. Further research is also needed into the semantics of these constructions. For
example, if it is discovered that there a re semantic restrictions on the verbs which can appear
in these constructions, this may be evidence that there is only one clause involved, since we
would be less likely to expect co-occurrence restrictions to exist across clause boundaries.
Furthermore, if these constructions do involve only a single clause, it remains to be
determined what the semantic difference is between these clauses and coordinate clauses,
such as the following.
(7-125) Gayinini-ni gin-awurrudbanyi îrra,what.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-PST pullginganj-ardi.",[213]
"Depending on the context in which it is uttered, example (8-25) could have a reading in
which the first clause provides temporal information about the main clause (i.e. Hale's (1976)
T-relative use); or one in which the two clauses are simply coordinate, each describing one of
a sequence of events.' 2
Adjoined clauses, irrespective of their function, can never be embedded: those with
subordinate function can appear either before or after the main clause; and coordinate clauses
usually occur in the same order as the events described. These complex clauses can be
separated by a brief pause, but are bound intonationally. Usually falling intonation spans both
clauses; however, when a clause with subordinate function (usually a temporal adjunct)
precedes the main clause, it is marked with a fall—rise intonation. Thus, on prosodic bases
such as these, complex clauses can be distinguished from a sequence of two simple clauses,
which form two separate intonation units and are generally separated by a slightly longer
pause.
This adjoined construction type in Wambaya thus serves a number of different functions,
both subordinate and coordinate. For clarity of exposition, in the following discussion I will
cover each of these types separately. Subordinate functions are discussed in §8.2.1, followed
by a discussion of coordinate clauses in §8.2.2. It should be remembered that, for the most
part, this distinction is made on a semantic/functional basis rather than a syntactic basis, and
thus may not always be clear cut.
8.2.1 SUBORDINATE FUNCTIONS
Adjoined clauses can have one of three subordinate functions: (i) they can function as
adjuncts to the main clause, supplying temporal or causal information (§8.2.1.1); (ii) they can
function adnominally, modifying a matrix NP (§8.2.1.2) and; (iii) they can function as
arguments for certain speech and perception verbs (§8.2.1.3). The former two functions are
referred to by Hale (1976) as `T-relative' 13 and `NP-relative' respectively. As mentioned12 Although there can be some slight differences in intonation — see below.
13 In fact, Hale's 'T-relative' function is only when the two clauses make identical time reference (p.79), so
does not cover the causal function. Hale discusses this function separately (p.81).",[235]

He let me go swimming. (lit. He sent me to swim.)7.2.7 VERBS WITH ALTERNATIONS IN TRANSITIVITY
As is clear in the above discussion, it is not uncommon for verbs in Wambaya to have
both transitive and intransitive case frames, without the existence of formal marking
distinguishing the two. Such a situation has been claimed to be unusual among Australian
languages (e.g. Dixon 1980:378), although more recent work has shown it to be less unusual
than first thought. Evans (1995a:344) shows that a large number of Kayardild verbs may
appear in either transitive or intransitive case frames, pointing out that this is true also for
other accusative Australian languages such as Lardil and Martuthunira. Transitivity
alternations are also common among verbs in the non-Pama-Nyungan (ergative) languages of
the Kimberley (Bill McGregor, pers.comm). Thus, strict transitivity appears to be a property
of Pama-Nyungan ergative languages (e.g. Dyirbal (Dixon 1972), Diyari (Austin 1981a),
Ngiyambaa (Donaldson 1980)) rather than holding of Australian languages more generally.
Two Wambaya verbs which show such transitivity alternations clearly are najbi `burn/
burn 0', and barndanyî `swear/swear at 0'. Najbi is a verb having what has been called a
`cognate subject' (Wilkins 1989), in that the semantics of the verb greatly restricts its possible
subjects. Such verbs constitute one restricted class of exceptions to the tendency for fixed
transitivity in many ergative (Pama-Nyungan) Australian languages (Evans 1995a: 344-345).
Examples of these verbs in each case frame follow. Note that the transitivity of the verb is
shown both by the case marking of the subject NP (when present) and by the form of the third
person singular subject bound pronoun: gi- registers intransitive subjects and gini-/ngiyî- are
used with transitive subjects.

"7.3.1 REFLEXIVE/RECIPROCAL CONSTRUCTIONS
These clauses have the same characteristics as the inherently reflexive verbs discussed in
§7.23 above: they require a nominative subject and the reflexive object bound pronoun in the
auxiliary. Reflexive and reciprocal clauses are semantically alike as in each case there is some
sort of identity between the agent and the patient: in reflexive clauses the two have the same
referent, and in reciprocal clauses (which necessarily have non-singular subjects) each
participant is both the agent and the patient.

As
derive an intransitive verb, from a transiti ve one; the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun
replaces the transitive object, and the form of the verb remains unchanged. That the verb is
intransitive in (7-111b) is demonstrated by the fact that the subject NP is in the nominative
case, rather than in the ergative/locative as in (7-111a), and that it is not possible to have an
overt object NP:

children.I(ACC) 3PL.A-RR-NF hit
The childreni are hitting the childreni.
More generally, the reflexive/reciprocal construction reduces the valency of a verb by one,
deriving intransitive verbs from, semitransitives and transitives (examples (7-113) and (7-114)
respectively), and transitive verbs from ditransitives (7-115). Irrespective of the valency of
the derived verb, however, the subject must be registered in the auxiliary with a transitive
subject bound pronoun.16 The reflexive/reciprocal pronoun replaces the direct object of
transitive and ditransitive verbs and the indirect object of semitransitive verbs. Examples
include:

16There are no examples in the corpus of reflexivised ditransitive verbs (such as jivznru in example (7-I 15))
co-occuring with an overt subject NP. Since such reflexive clauses are actually transitive we may expect
the subject NP to appear in the ergative/locative case, unlike all other reflexive constructions, in which it
must be in the nominative. This needs to be checked in the field.",[211]
"This is the only situation in which there is a mismatch between transitive subject bound
pronouns and ergative/locative case marking. In all other types of constructions, a NP
represented by a transitive subject bound pronoun must have ergative/locative case marking.
While indirect objects of verbs such as ayanî `look (for)' and yandu `wait (for)' are not
cross-referenced in the auxiliary with ordinary object bound pronouns (see example (5-3)
above), they can be cross-referenced by the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun.

"CHAPTER 8SYNTAX OF COMPLEX SENTENCESA complex sentence contains more than one simple clause and can be divided into two
types: those in which one of the clauses is non-finite and subordinate to the other clause, and
those in which both clauses are finite. In_ the latter type, the finite clauses are simply
juxtaposed and there is no evidence that one is syntactically subordinate to the other. I will
refer to these clauses as `adjoined clauses' (in the sense of Hale 1976) and discuss them in
detail in §8.2.
8.1 NON-FINITE SUBORDINATE CLAUSES
Non-finite subordinate clauses are reduced clauses. They are reduced in four ways: (i)
they do not contain an auxiliary; (ii) they provide no information concerning tense, aspect and
mood; (iii) they are marked as subordinate with either the infinitive suffix or one of three
nominal case suffixes (see below); and (iv) their subject is obligatorily deleted under coreference with a main clause subject or object argument.
There are three types of non-finite subordinate clauses in Wambaya: prior (the subordinate
clause situation precedes that of the main clause), simultaneous (the subordinate clause
situation is concurrent with that of the main clause) and purposive (the situation described by
the subordinate clause follows, and is the purpose of, that of the main clause). A system of
switch-reference operates when the two clauses are simultaneous. There is no switchreference in purposive subordinate clauses, and there is not sufficient data to determine the
situation for prior subordinate clauses.
Table 8.1 shows the inflections that appear on verbs in non-finite subordinate clauses,
where SS (Same Subject) means that the (omitted) subject of the subordinate clause is coreferential with that of the main clause and DS (Different Subject) means that the subject of the
subordinate clause is co-referential with the direct object of the main clause) For a discussion
of the form of these suffixes as verbal inflections see §6.1.

with a main clause NP other than subject or direct object (as it can in Warlpiri, for example (Hale 1976)).

subordinate clause. In this example, (7-80), it functions as an argument of the verb ganjimi `finish

"7.2.3.1 SIMPLE REFLEXIVE VERBS
Reflexive verbs subcategorise for a nominative subject NP and the reflexive object bound
pronoun in the auxiliary. Although the subject of such verbs is in the nominative case, the
auxiliary must contain a transitive subject bound pronoun. This is the only situation in which
a transitive subject bound pronoun does not represent an ergative NP. The simple inherently
reflexive verbs found in the corpus are gurda `be sick' and jagina `lie with one leg resting on

The different uses of =nima are related by the fact that they all se rve to modify

highlighting deviation from a presupposition that something more or different would be
expected. In example (7-192), for instance, =nima denies the presupposition that the speaker
would have been given both meat and bread; in (7-195), it denies an expectation that the
travellers would have arrived at their destination already; and in (7-199) the function of =nima
is to deny the presupposition that the speaker went anywhere else. The 'counter-expectation'
meaning of (7-198) is not so obvious. However, this utterance was given in a context in

As can be seen in the examples above, =minyî can be used with either of the two senses
that McConvell (1983) identi fies for English `again': (i) repetition of an action or situation
and (ii) return to a former position or state. In example (7-200) =minyi indicates repetition of
the full situation: it is true that the event of raining will be repeated. In (7-201) and (7-202) on
the other hand, =minyi indicates only a return to a former state or position, rather than a
repetition of the whole event. Thus (7-202), for example, means that `he' was asleep before
and that he is crying in order to return to that former state of sleeping. It does not mean that
the event of his crying has happened before and is now being repeated. Similarly, (7-201)
describes the situation in which `she' was here and will return to this former position. It does
not refer to a repetition of the event of returning.","[223, 224, 225]"

There are two alternative constructions available for negating an indicative clause, each
containing a different negative particle (glossed NEG). Although speakers claim that the two
constructions have the same meaning, the distribution of each construction in the corpus
suggests that there is in fact a difference in usage between the two I will discuss this
difference below, but first I will explain and exemplify the structural characteristics of the
constructions.","[216, 217]"
"Parts of speech and other preliminaries57OBJECT
(i) Object NPs take the accusative case.
(ii) First and second person objects are represented by a bound pronoun in the second
position in the auxiliary. ('Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary; see
§5.2).
The main-clause object is that which is co-referential with the (omitted) subject of a
simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
infinitive suffix -barda (see §8.1).
Some ditransitive verbs subcategorise for two accusative objects, only one of which is
registered in the auxiliary (see §7.2). I thus make a distinction between direct objects, to
which the above three generalisations apply, and second objects, which are characterised by
(i), but not (ii) and (iii).
INDIRECT OBJECT
The evidence for indirect object is considerably weaker than that for subject and object.
Indirect objects are marked with the dative case and are never represented in the auxiliary and
are thereby distinguished from subjects and objects. Indirect objects can be distinguished
from dative adjuncts and complements in that they are subcategorisable and semantically
unrestricted, and are thereby core functions. In addition, unlike other complements and
adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal constructions, in which
case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary with the reflexive/reciprocal
pronoun (see examples (3-29) and (3-30)). As shown in (3-31) to (3-34), this is not possible

Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and longterm interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.xiACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"Verbs159An alternative analysis for the verbs of the J Class would be to consider the /j/ as in fact
belonging to the verb root, rather than being thematic. Under this analysis the non-future
suffix would still be -0, but the final consonant of the root would be dropped according to
the general phonotactic constraint that words in Wambaya be vowel-final (see §2.2).
However, if the roots of J Class verbs contain a final /j/, then there is no obvious explanation
as to why these verbs belong to a different class than other verbs, such as ngaj- `see', which
also have fj/-final roots. Under the `thematic /jr analysis however, this inconsistency is
avoided as the roots of these two verbs are different: one (daguma-) is vowel-final and the
other (ngaj-) is consonant-final.
There is some evidence, however, to suggest that /j/ may once have been part of the verbal
root, or even part of the non-future inflection, -bi. For example, many of the verbs of the J
Class have cognates in other languages/dialects of the Eastern. Group that have final

One of the particularly interesting things about the Wambaya verbal inflections is their
striking similarity to some of the verbal inflections in Garrwa, a language which borders
Wambaya but appears otherwise unrelated to it. According to the analysis of Garrwa verbs
proposed by Belfrage (1992:46), Garrwa has five verbal conjugation classes. Of these five
there are two which show substantial similarity to the two Wambaya classes and are also
referred to by Belfrage as the J conjugation class and the 0 conjugation class. Table 6.3 gives
the forms of the inflections for these two Garrwa verbal conjugation classes.

so distinctive to verbs in Wambaya. Furthermore, the unmarked inflections of these two
classes in Garrwa are identical to the future tense inflections that occur in the respective
Wambaya classes. And the Wambaya non-future inflection, -bi, turns up (optionally) before

"The dative case suffix -nka is used in purposive clauses (examples (8-9) and (8-10)).
These are usually adjuncts (8-10), but may also be verbal complements of certain verbs like
dirndirrimî `teach' (8-12). Purposive subordinate clauses differ from those mentioned above
in that an object NP does not simply appear in the same case that it would in a main clause,
but must be marked with dative case, like the verb ((8-9), (8-10)). The dative suffix -nka is
used in any purposive clause, regardless of whether the subordinate subject is co-referential
with the subject or object NP in the matrix clause. Thus, there is no switch-reference in
purposive clauses.

Some verbs subcategorise for . `subject complements' — secondary predicates subcategorised for by the verb and agreeing in case, number and gender with the subject. An
example of this is the verb manku in its sense 'to feel', which subcategorises for a reflexive
object and a subject complement denoting the state of affairs of the subject:

Like complements, adjuncts have consistent meanings which remain unaffected by the
nature of the verb with which they occur. However; unlike complements, adjuncts are not
selected by verbs and can potentially co-occur with any type of verb in a clause. Typical
examples of adjuncts include locative phrases (example (3-22)), temporal phrases (3-23),
benefactive dative phrases (3-24) and secondary predicates (3-25).

"112Chapter 4(iii) There are two forms in which the order of the `number' and the `distance'
suffixes are reversed: inuwuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class I'
and nanawuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class II'.
The different forms for each of these categories are as follows:
Gender prefixes (ABS; NABS)
Class I: {i-; ni-}
Class II: {na-; nga-}
Class III: {ma-; ?}
Class Iv: {ya-; ?}
Stem
Nominative, Accusative:
Ergative/Locative:
Dative:{ -ni- (I); -na- (II, Iv); -ma- (III) }45
{ -nki- (I, II), -nka- (II) }46
{-naga-When the remote suffix -yaga is added to the stem, the final low vowel of the stem
becomes high. Thus, -na- becomes -ni-yaga; -naga- becomes -nagî-yaga, and so forth.
Evans (1990) discusses the tendency in Australian languages for demonstratives to derive
from verbs of stance (i.e. `sit', `stand' or `lie') or verbs of perception (i.e. `see, look').
Thus, it is possible that the nominative and accusative demonstrative stems in Wambaya, if
their underlying form is taken to be -na- (see footnote 45), may have developed from the
common non-Pama-Nyungan verb na meaning `see, look' (Evans 1990:144).
The dative stem -naga- appears to be made up of the nominative/accusative stem -nafollowed by the suffix -ga which occurs with all non-singular object and oblique free
pronouns in Ngarnga and Gudanji (Chadwick 1978:51), and appears in Wambaya nonsingular oblique pronouns with the addition of the comitative suffix; for example, mirndigayîlî `1DU.INC.OBL-COMIT'.
Distance
Proximate: {-0}
Remote:
{-yaga/-ya; -ma)
The remote suffix -yaga is reduced to -ya when it is followed by either the dual or the
plural suffix. The remote suffix -ma is found only in the singular nominative/accusative
forms.
There are a couple of examples in the corpus in which both remote suffixes are used:45The variation in the form of the stem can probably be explained in terms of vowel harmony and analogic
nasal assimilation. Thus, if the underlying form is taken to be -na-, then the Class i form (-ni-) could be
explained in terms of vowel harmony triggered by the preceding high vowel in the prefix, and the Class
tit form (-ma-) as assimilation of the alveolar nasal in the stem to the bilabial nasal of the prefix. There
is no evidence that these assimilation processes are productive synchronically (most vowel harmony is
regressive (see §2.3.4.3) and there are no other known instances of such nasal assimilation). However,
the presence of the alveolar nasal in the stem of the two Class iii Binbinka demonstratives ntaniga
`remote singular nominative/accusative Class w' and manigula `remote dual nominative/accusative Class
Ill' adds support to the theory that the Wambaya Class Ili stem may have derived from one containing an
alveolar nasal.
46 Note that this stem becomes -nka- in Class ti proximate non-singular forms, but elsewhere remains -nki.","[129, 130]"
"Syntax of simple sentences1877.2.5 TRANSITIVE VERBS
Transitive verbs are characterised by the fact that they subcategorise for an ergative subject
argument and only one other obligatory object argument (in this respect they differ from
ditransitive verbs which require two object-type arguments).
7.2.5.1 SIMPLE TRANSITIVE VERBS
Most of the transitive verbs are of this type; they subcategorise for an ergative subject NP
and an accusative object NP. It is very difficult to generalise about the semantic characteristics
of simple transitive verbs as they are great in number and varied in meaning. Some examples
are verbs of (i) physical impact or effect (whether desirable or undesirable), such as daguma
'hit O', anmurru `cuddle o',: burlurlandu `blow o away, blow O about', dudiyarri `spear 0',
jarungbî 'kiss O', angbardî 'build O', wugbardi `cook O' mujumi 'gather O'; (ii) perception,.
such as bujanga 'perceive smell of O', ngajbi 'see O, look at O', manku 'hear o, listen to o,
remember O'; (iii) transport, as in didija `carry O on hip', nyanyuwa `collect 0'; (iv)
movement, in which the verb describes the relationship between the movement of two
referents, such as nyurrunyurru `chase O', bardganyî 'follow O', jarrgi 'track O', dunkala
'chase O away', lurrgbanyi 'grab O'; and others such as yabu 'take O, have O', jiyanggi
`know O', gamijanga laugh at', janyî `answer O' and gurdumî 'be too noisy for O'.

This alternation of ngajbi may be of the type that has been reported for languages such as
Warlpiri (e.g. Hale 1982) in which there is a productive pattern of replacing the direct object
of many transitive verbs with a dative indirect object, denoting a failed object or a goal. This
use of ngajbî is the only example in the corpus of this type of alternation in Wambaya; further
investigation is required.
7.2.5.2 TRANSITIVE VERBS WITH COGNATE OBJECTS
The transitive verbs nijbi `sing o' and ngarlu `dance O' can occur only with a single type
of object: namely one referring to a song and a dance, respectively. Such objects are usually
referred to as cognate objects (e.g. Austin 1982).

"7.2.2.3 INTRANSITIVE VERBS WITH SUBJECT COMPLEMENTS
Subject complements are second predicates on the subject that are subcategorised for by a
verb. Most second predicates are adjuncts: those of manner, for example, can combine with
almost any type of verb (see §7.4.2 below). A very small number of verbs, however,
actually subcategorise for a second predicate, in which case it is considered a subject
complement.
The only intransitive verb in the corpus that subcategorises for a subject complement is
mirra in its meaning of `be, become'. In this use, mîrra links an entity (the subject), with a
property (the subject complement). The subject complement must agree with the subject in
gender, number and case (nominative).

3PL.ACCAs indicated in Table 5.1, third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. While a
more typical analysis of the data would be to analyse the third person object morpheme to be
zero, a common situation in both Australian languages and other languages of the world, the
behaviour of auxiliaries of clauses with third person objects with respect to tense marking
indicates that they are best analysed as containing no object bound pronoun at all. The
arguments for this are given in Nordlinger (1993b) and in the discussion of tense marking in
§5.2.1.
There are a few examples in which a plural bound pronoun is used with dual reference,
with no obvious difference in meaning. The following extract is taken from Text 1 (Appendix

"8.2.1.2 ADJOINED CLAUSES AS NP MODIFIERS
Adjoined clauses can also function adnominally, modifying a main clause NP. In this
function the modifying clause follows the NP which it modifies. In the examples in the
corpus, the adjoined clause modifies either the direct object (examples (8-39), (8-40)), an
oblique object (8-41) or one of the NPs of a verbless clause (8-38). There are no examples in
which the subject of a verbal clause is modified by a finite clause. The modified NP can have
either subject function ((8-39), (8-40), (8-41)) or object function (8-38) in the relative
clause.16
16 This adnominal function can often be perfomed by a verb inflected with either the agentive or the
privative suffix (both of which can derive a nominal from a verb). The difference between this type of
relative clause and that which is expressed with a finite clause is that in this type the relative clause
expresses a general characteristic rather than a specific action or event: 'he who is a fighter', rather than
'he who is fighting'. A couple of examples are:

"4.9 NP STRUCTURE
A Wambaya noun phrase consists of a head and one or more modifiers, all of which are
optional (the head can be ellipsed when it is recoverable from previous discourse; see below).
All members of the NP must agree in terms of gender, number and case (where
morphologically possible). As is common to several Australian languages, elements of NPs in
Wambaya need not be contiguous in the clause. This possibility of discontinuous NP
constituents has led researchers working on some Australian languages (e.g. Heath 1986 on
Nunggubuyu, Blake 1983 on Kalkatungu) to suggest that these languages may not have NPNominals131constituents, and that apparent NPS can just be treated as apposed nominals. I will not review
the arguments for this analysis here, but assume that the following two pieces of evidence
argue for the existence of a NP constituent in Wambaya, at least in those cases in which the
elements are contiguous (see below for more discussion of discontinuous NPs):
(i) Usually the auxiliary must follow the initial word of a clause. However, it is possible
for the auxiliary to follow a complex NP, thereby providing evidence for its existence
as a constituent_ The position of the auxiliary can then be described as being after the
initial constituent of a clause.
(ii) In possessive phrases in which the possessor is marked with either genitive or dative
case, relational case marking is found only on the head of the NP. As relational case
marking is not found on the possessor nominal in this situation, the case marking
found on the head nominal also refers to the modifying nominal, thereby providing
evidence that the two nominals in such phrases form a single NP constituent.
The structure of a Wambaya NP is as follows.78 Note that any one of the modifers listed in
the position before the head can be postposed to follow the head.79
(MODIFIERS)(HEAD) (MODIFIER)(Dem)(POSS)(Num)(Adj) Nom
Dem = Demonstrative
POSS = Possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or possessive NPNum = Numeral
Adj = Adjective
Nom = Nominal
The head is usually filled by a noun, but can in principle be any type of nominal. An
example from Text 1 in Appendix A in which a numeral functions as the head is:
(4-301) Garnguji=mijiin-i-nmirra.many.I(NOM~INFER 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sitThere must be a big group (of people).
The fact that this example occurs at the beginning of the text (i.e. the second line) before
there has been any mention of people, suggests that the numeral is functioning as the head,
rather than simply modifying an ellipsed head. However, there are a small number of
examples in which it may be argued that the head has been ellipsed. Consider the following
sequence (lines 62-64) from the same text:S0787980This is the same structure as in Kayardild (Evans 1995a) and is very similar to the Gooniyandi structure
(McGregor 19%).
In his detailed discussion of Gooniyandi noun phrases, McGregor (1990) makes a distinction between
reference modification and referent modification, and shows that this distinction correlates with a contrast
in function between pre-head and post-head modifiers. Thus, an element which precedes the head modifies
the reference of the head nominal, it selects a subset of the potential referents denoted by the nominal. In
contrast. a post-head constituent modifies the head's referent, indicating a quality of property of the thing
itself, which may be independent of the nominal denoting the entity (p. 26711). Further research is needed
to determine whether there is likewise a semantic difference between pre- and post- head modifiers in
Wambaya.
This discussion has benefited greatly from McGregor's (1990) discussion of NPs in Gooniyandi,132Chapter4daguma juwarramba.

many.i(ACC) 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit
They'd been killing a lot of them.
In this example, in contrast to that given in (4-301), garnguji in the final line appears to be
modifying the ellipsed head juwarramba which is mentioned in the preceding two clauses.
Thus, this is one example in which an NP has no overt constituent corresponding to its head.
A NP can also be made up of a pronoun. A (non-possessive) pronoun is always the head
of a phrase, and usually occurs alone (although see below for some possible exceptions to
this).
Some example NPs are:
Dem + Noun + POSS

"46Parts of speech and other preliminaries473.1.1 INFLECTING WORD CLASSES
3.1.1.1 NOMINALS
(i) and (ii) Nouns and Adjectives
For the most part, adjectives and nouns in Wambaya can be considered the same. In this
respect, Wambaya is typical of Australian languages, in which there is generally little formal
distinction between nouns and adjectives (Dixon 1980:272). Both nouns and adjectives are
inflected for case, number and gender, can function as the head of a noun phrase or as a
modifier qualifying the head; and can function as the predicate of a verbless clause (see §7.1).
However, there are differences between nouns and adjectives that support the treatment of
them as two different subclasses even though they are both contained within the larger
superordinate class of nominals. These differences are semantic, morphological and
syntactic.
Semantically, nouns typically denote objects and entities while adjectives typically denote
attributes. Furthermore, while nouns inherently belong to only one gender (or at most two, in
the case of some animate and plant nouns), an adjective has no inherent gender, but
potentially can be marked for any of the four genders in agreement with the noun that it
modifies (or in the case of an adjective functioning as the head of the phrase, in agreement
with the referent). For example:
bugayî
alaji
bugayirna bayigina
buguwama jigama
buguwa
darranggubig boy (I)
big bag (II)
big yam (III)
big stick (IV)Morphologically, most of the inflectional suffixes are identical for both nouns and
adjectives. However there is at least one difference, again concerning gender: while Class IV
(the neuter gender) is generally not marked on nouns, it is marked on some adjectives by
either -a, -ga or -ja:4
Nouns:
balamurru
wunba
barrawuspear (1V)
wind (IV)
house (1v)Adjectives:
gurijb-a
good-Iv
murrgun-ga three-IV
bagi-ga
bad-Iv
garngu-ja
many-IV
Note that this is simply a difference in the form of the marking, not in the number of
gender possibilities for nouns and adjectives, which is exactly the same.
The difference between the semantics of nouns and adjectives also leads to different
derivational possibilities. For example, the derivational suffix -mî, which can be attached to a
nominal X to derive a factitive verb with the meaning `cause to be X, make X' is found only4However with most adjectives, as with nouns, Class iv is not overtly marked (see §4.2.2).","[64, 65]"

The phonemes for Wambaya are given in Table 2.1 below. The orthographic symbol for
each phoneme is given in parentheses following the IPA symbol. Note that, as voicing is not
distinctive in Wambaya, the decision to use the voiced IPA stop symbols in Table 2.1 is
arbitrary, although it reflects the Wambaya community's choice of orthography. For the rest
of this chapter I will use the orthographic symbol to represent the phoneme (e.g. In not /.V).
Long vowels are given below in parentheses to indicate their rarity. There are only a handful
of words with long vowels in the corpus; these are discussed in §2.1.4.
