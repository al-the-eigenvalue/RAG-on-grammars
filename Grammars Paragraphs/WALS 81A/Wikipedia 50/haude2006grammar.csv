"2567Clause and sentence structureIn this chapter, the most important aspects of simple and complex sentences in Movima are
described. Before going into details in the following sections, I want to point out some crucial
properties of Movima clause structure.
First of all, Movima has a hierarchical alignment system. There is no case marking and no
agreement indicating grammatical relations. Word order is fixed, but it is semantically
determined: in a transitive clause, the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded
as the first core argument (ARG1) and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the
second core argument (ARG2). The semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or
inverse voice marking on the verb, as described in 7.5. An effect of this system is an
ergativity split, since the alignment of grammatical relations and semantic roles is switched by
the voice markers (cf. 7.5.3).
The fact that due to the hierarchical alignment system, grammatical relations are not
distinguished by case marking, agreement, or word order, makes it difficult to attach labels
such as “subject” and “object” to the syntactic positions. J. Judy (1965) uses these terms,
labelling the first argument in a transitive clause “subject” and the second argument “object”.
This, however, is a problem in inverse clauses, where, as Judy also points out, the second
argument encodes the agent.
Moreover, it can be shown that if anything can be analysed as the subject in Movima, this is
not the first, but the second core argument, which represents the undergoer in a direct
transitive clause. This becomes apparent from the structure of relative clauses, described in
7.11. In addition, the second, but not the first core argument can be deleted in coordination,
which is also a criterion for subjecthood (cf. Keenan 1976). However, it may be misleading to
use the term “subject” for the second transitive argument, since it has some untypical
properties. In the direct construction, which can be seen as pragmatically less marked since it
indicates that the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy acts on the participant lower on
the hierarchy, the second argument encodes the undergoer. Also, this argument is not
obligatorily realized. To avoid confusion, I use the neutral terms ARGintr for the intransitive
argument, ARG1 for the first transitive argument, and ARG2 for the second transitive
argument. ARGintr and ARG2 are furthermore subsumed under the term “absolutive
argument”.
Note, furthermore, that ARG1, the first argument in a transitive clause, is encoded in the
same way as the possessor (cf. 6.1).134
This chapter is organized as follows. Sections 7.1–7.8 discuss constituent order, argument
encoding, and the assignment of semantic roles in affirmative main clauses. In Sections 7.9–
7.10, I describe affirmative main clauses with nonverbal predicates, as well as arguments that
contain a verb. In Section 7.11, relative clauses are described. Section 7.12 presents the main
134The peculiarities of the Movima system outlined here may arise from the possibility that, at least historically,
all clauses are basically equational. Under this view, ARG1 represents a possessor, and the absolutive argument
represents the intransitive subject everywhere. This means that the proposition ‘I hit the dog’ would in Movima
be expressed as ‘my hitten one is the dog’. The term “subject” would be uncontroversial then. For an analysis of
other languages along these lines, see Sasse 1991.","[279, 280]"
"1.9. Structural characteristics of Movima
Movima has many characteristics typical of Amazonian languages. I will compare it to the
features listed as typically Amazonian in Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999: 8f.).
(a)8polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
Movima is agglutinating, i.e., most morphemes have only one meaning, and displays a
limited degree of fusion. It is head-marking in that one transitive argument as well aspossession are marked on the predicate or possessed noun, respectively. It is
problematic to classify the language as polysynthetic, however. Polysynthetic features
of Movima are that a clause can consist of the predicate alone, and that there is
productive noun incorporation. However, while voice/valency and applicative
categories are encoded by verbal morphology, tense, location, and direction (typical
features of polysynthesis in Amazonian languages, cf. Payne 1990: 214) are not
morphologically expressed on the verb, and person only to a limited degree.
Moreover, Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), a feature
untypical of polysynthetic languages.
(b)/ / in the vowel inventory, contrastive nasalization of vowels
Neither the central unrounded vowel [ ], nor contrastive nasalization of vowels exist in
Movima. The five vowel phonemes are i, e, a, o, u.(c)Extensive classifier and/or semantically based gender systems
Movima has a semantically-based gender system, marked on the referential elements
(articles, pronouns, demonstratives). This system is independent of the classifier
system, which seems to have arisen through compounding and incorporation.(d)Only few oblique cases
Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the
referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is
absent.(e)Possession marked on the possessed noun, not on the possessor; most widespread
word order is ‘possessor possessed’
Possession is marked on the possessed noun. Since the possessed noun is marked by
an enclitic encoding the possessor, however, the word order is ‘possessed possessor’.(f)Just one core argument cross-referenced on the verb
This is true for Movima: the only core argument that is obligatorily cross-referenced is
the transitive argument encoding the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy.(g)‘Split-ergative’ systems arise due to complex rules determining which core argument
is cross-referenced on the verb
A split-ergative pattern can indeed be observed in Movima, arising from the
hierarchical alignment system: the transitive argument lower on the animacy hierarchy
(in subordinate and negative clause, the argument higher on the hierarchy) is encoded
like the intransitive argument, regardless of whether it is A or O.(h)The bound pronominal forms marking a possessor within an NP are the same as one
of the bound pronominal paradigms for marking core arguments of a clause
This is indeed the case. The possessor is encoded in the same way as the first
argument of a transitive clause, which is the only argument obligatorily encoded.","[31, 32]"

"9(i)Most languages have prefixes, and there are fewer prefix than suffix positions
There is only one “real” prefix in Movima, the oblique case marker n-. Other prefixes
are reduplicated elements. Otherwise, Movima is mainly suffixing.(j)(On typical order of prefixes)
Does not apply: only one prefix (n- or a reduplicated element) can occur at a time.(k)Most verbal categories (e.g. tense, aspect, modality, direction) are expressed through
optional suffixes
All these categories are expressed not by suffixes, but by optional particles in
Movima, whose distribution in the clause is relatively free. Tense is, in addition, a
nominal category, expressed by referential elements.(l)Subordinate clauses typically involve nominalized verbs, the type of subordination
being marked on the verb
Indeed, subordination (as well as main-clause negation) always involves
nominalization of the predicate. The type of subordination, however, is either not
overtly indicated, or indicated by a particle preceding the subordinate clause.(m)If there is noun incorporation, typically only those nouns which are obligatorily
possessed can be incorporated, and they typically precede the verb root
There are different types of productive noun incorporation, involving unpossessed
nouns or body-part-terms. Apart form body-part terms, obligatorily possessed nouns
cannot be incorporated. The incorporated nominal element follows the root.(n)In many languages adverbs and adpositions may be incorporated into the verb
This does not seem to be the case in Movima.(o)There is generally only a small class of lexical numbers
Indeed, there are only four number terms, from 1 to 4, and the terms for 1 and 4 seem
to be morphologically complex (“no other” and “several times two,” respectively).","[32, 33]"

are subject to voice alternations (cf. 8.4). In this chapter, the different kinds of complex bases
are presented.
The first part of this chapter deals with the two types of noun incorporation, argument
incorporation (cf. 9.1) and modifying incorporation (cf. 9.2). Argument incorporation, already
introduced in 7.7, is different from all other derivational processes described in this chapter,
since the resulting verb is automatically monovalent and does not participate in voice
alternations. It is described here in order to contrast it with modifying incorporation.
Modifying incorporation, like the processes described later in this chapter, creates a complex
base which undergoes voice and valency alternations (as characterized in Ch. 8).
The other processes which create a complex base can be subsumed under the cover term of
applicatives. These morphemes allow a verb to take an additional bivalent voice marker or to
take a new participant as a core argument. The most straightforward morphemes of this type
are the causative suffix -poj (cf. 9.3) and the benefactive and malefactive suffixes -kwa and
-bij (cf. 9.4). The suffix -kwi or -pi ‘LOC’, which only occurs on semantically bivalent bases,
is clearly an applicative morpheme since it introduces a location as an additional undergoer.
Other applicative suffixes are more difficult to describe, since their function can vary
according to the base they are attached to. Section 9.6 presents the not very productive
applicative suffix -pa. Sections 9.7 and 9.8 deal with the applicative suffixes - e ‘coparticipant’ and -e ‘applicative’, which seem to be very similar in form and function, but
have clearly distinct functional and distributional properties. In 9.8, the agentive voice marker
-e e (cf. 8.1.3), phonologically also very similar to these applicative markers, will be brought
up again. An overview of the main properties of these three phonologically similar
morphemes is provided in Section 9.9.
Other verbal morphemes, which do not interact directly with the voice and valency
properties of the verb and which generally have an aspectual or a modal function, are
described in Ch. 10.","[387, 388, 389, 390]"
"As can be seen, Movima only deviates in minor points from the typical Amazonian patterns
observed by Dixon and Aikhenvald, while the similarities are striking. In the following
paragraphs, I will point out some other features of Movima, not mentioned in connection with
the list above.
Lexical tone, a feature found in a number of Amazonian languages, is not present in
Movima. Instead, there is contrastive vowel length. A consonant which deserves special
mention, since it does not seem to be common in the area, is the voiceless lateral fricative / /.
The syllable structure is simple: either CV or CVC.
Morphological features which deserve special mention include the existence of an infix,
inserted according to metric criteria. Different types of reduplication are not only frequent, but
also serve a wide range of functions which are noteworthy from a cross-linguistic perspective.
These include, among other things, voice marking, the marking of inalienable possession, the
expression of predicative possession, and nominalization. Furthermore, Movima uses10different cliticization processes to distinguish grammatical relations.
The major parts of speech, distinguished by their morphological properties, are verbs,
nouns, and particles. Adjectives form a subclass of nouns. Referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) constitute a category of their own, but display nounlike rather than
verblike properties. The class of particles is heterogeneous, the defining feature being that
particles are not productively combined with other morphemes. There are no ideophones.
The fine-grained system of reference and deixis, expressed by referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) is highly complicated, something which is not uncommon for
Amazonian languages. Gender, number, presence, absence, visibility, position, and motion
form the main parameters of deictic reference. The system also marks temporal categories on
nominal constituents, differentiating between actual or future existence and ceased existence
of the referent.
Compounding and incorporation occur frequently. The different degrees of lexicalization of
words created by these processes make the morphological description of Movima difficult.
The morphological entities that can form part of a compound or can be incorporated into a
verb are nouns, noun roots, truncated nominal elements, and other bound elements with
lexical content. Many of these morphemes have a classificatory function, indicating shape and
consistency of an entity. All this is typical for Amazonian languages (cf. Payne 1990).
Demonstratives and other pronouns are not combined with nominal elements.
Inalienable possession is an important criterion for the semantic classification of nouns.
Relational (inalienably possessed) nouns have to be overtly marked when denoting an
unpossessed or inalienably possessed entity; conversely, non-relational nouns are overtly
marked when denoting an inalienably possessed entity.
A clause can have maximally two core arguments, depending on the valency of the verb.
The valency of a verb is generally overtly indicated by voice markers, which also specify the
semantic role(s) of the argument(s). The productivity and function of voice markers depend
on semantic properties of the base. Grammatical relations are distinguished by the way in
which the argument is cliticized to the base. It seems that Movima displays syntactic
ergativity, most clearly in relative clauses.
As mentioned above, only the transitive argument higher on the animacy hierarchy is
obligatorily encoded. Strikingly, there is no obligatory marker for the first person singular, so
that this person is implicit on a bivalent predicate unmarked for person. This is untypical for
Amazonian languages (Dan Everett, p.c.). It has to do with the fact that, while all persons,
except the first, are encoded by enclitics, first and second person are (also) encoded by
optional bound pronouns preceding the predicate. The first person is not encoded by an
enclitic, but by the optional preverbal form only.
There is no copula. Instead, in equational or possessive clauses, nouns function as
predicates. Morphological verbs can occur in NPs, their voice marker specifying the referent.
Serial verb constructions only exist to a very limited degree, and always involve verbs of
directed motion.","[33, 34]"
"2476.5.3. Retention and reduplication of -kwa
Instead of dropping the suffix -kwa, as described in the previous section, the nouns ending in
-kwa (cf. (59)) can undergo infixing reduplication when denoting an inalienably possessed
entity. This is the same process as with any other non-relational noun (cf. 6.4.1). As will be
shown in 6.6.3, for body-part terms ending in -kwa, this is the only option for possessive
marking. Since the suffix -kwa is the final element of these nouns, this is the syllable that is
reduplicated:
(74)as
lora-n-<kwa~>kwa=as
ART.n BR.leaf-LN-<INAL~>ABS=ART.n
‘the mango leaf’(75)as
mosi-<kwa:~>kwa
ART.n BR.lower_back-<INAL~>ABS
‘my lower back’manka
mangoAt least synchronically, there does not seem to be a semantic difference between this
mechanism and the one described above, which involves the omission of -kwa. Both can be
used when the referent is physically attached to its possessor as well as when it is detached
from it. This is shown by (76)a and b which both equally express inalienable possession:
(76)a. i’ko
PRO.pllora-n-a=as
manka
BR.leaf-LN-LV-ART.n mango~b. i’ko
lora-n<kwa~>-kwa=as
PRO.pl
BR.leaf-LN<INAL~>-ABS=ART.n
‘They are mango leaves.’manka
mango
{EA 13, 135c}However, in elicitation, speakers do employ the different constructions in order to
differentiate between the two types of inalienable possession (attachment and detachment).
This can be seen in the following examples. In both, variant a. is used to refer to an entity that
is still part of a whole, and b. is used for a detached entity:
(77)a. is
di~di-n-a=as
ko’
ART.pl
RED~BR.grain-LN-LV=ART.n tree
‘the seeds of the tree [still on the tree]’
b. is

‘the seeds of the tree [on the ground]’(78)248a. as

a~ a<kwa~>-kwa=os
ART.n RED~BR.seam<INAL~>-ABS=ART.n.p
‘the [loose] seam of my ex-dress’do’we
clothes
{EA 13, 291c}It can be assumed that historically, the two types of marking inalienable possession with
nouns ending in -kwa had the function of differentiating between attached vs. detached
inalienable possession. This is because speakers still use this resource, although
inconsistently. However, at the present stage of the language, a specific inalienable relation is
not connected to a specific possessive form: both are used interchangeably, as was shown in
(76). Finally, note that on body-part terms with the ending -kwa, this ending is always
reduplicated and not dropped. This will be described in the following section.","[270, 271, 272]"
"174in determiner function, i.e. with the cliticized determining element (cf. 4.4), usually the long
form is used:
(158)i:ri=s
kwe ris
DM.spk.pl=DET sujo
‘This sujo [type of reed].’{EA 6, 119}The long form is probably used here because the short form together with the determining
element (here, i:=s) would in some cases be phonologically similar to the presential article (is
‘ART.pl’). The short form of the speaker-oriented neuter demonstrative, in contrast, is often
found in article position, since it is sufficiently distinct from it. Here, it is interchangeable
with the long form:
(159)a. ay=s
do’we
~
DM.spk.n=DET clothes
‘these clothes (I’m wearing)’b. ayru=s
do’we
DM.spk.n=DET clothes
{EA 7, 084}Very often, the long and the short form cooccur, in this order. This is a phenomenon which
does not occur with any of the other referential elements, and further research is needed to
explain it.86 The following example illustrates it:
(160)jayna
ayru
ay
loy-’i
DSC
DM.spk.n DM.spk.n make_ready-D
‘This is made ready now.’{EA 7, 037b}In the case of the feminine forms, which do not have a long and a short variant, the form is
simply repeated:
(161)kilni

de:-che n-as
mo<si~>si=n,

NEG see-DR=2--f
‘She is there behind you, don’t you see her?’
{EA, DEM 031}The proximate demonstratives are prototypically used to refer to entities that are within reach
of either the speaker or the addressee. This includes the body parts of the respective person
(cf. (162)), entities in direct contact with the body (in (163), the speaker is holding the object),
and entities that are within reach of either speaker or adressee (cf. (161) above and (164)
below). In contrast to the other presential demonstratives (cf. 4.9.2 below), the proximate
demonstratives do not require that the speaker actually looks at the referent (as shown by
(164)).","[197, 198]"
"1.7. History of linguistic description
The first materials of the Movima language are lists of words and phrases (Hervás y Panduro
1787, D’Orbigny 1838, Heath 1883, Cardús 1886, Chamberlain 1910, Créqui-Montfort &
Rivet 1914, del Castillo 1929). Of these older lists, the one produced by the missionary
Cardús (1886) is most reproduced in the literature. In the 1960s, Movima was studied
extensively by Robert and Judith Judy of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The results
include a word list with a grammatical sketch (1962a), an outline of the phoneme inventory
(1962b), two articles on specific topics (J. Judy 1965 and R. Judy 1965), and a tagmemic
grammar (1965 and 1967).
A government-financed alphabetization campaign led by Colette Grinevald in 1995 raised
new interest in the language. An alphabet was created by the speakers, mainly based on the
orthography used by Judy and Judy, but with some changes (most importantly, c and qu were
replaced by k). The workshops, furthermore, resulted in the publication of a collection of
stories in Movima (Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Planificación 1998) and in a course
book introducing the alphabet (Ministerio de Educación et al. 2003). Also, Colette Grinevald
published an article on Movima noun classifiers (Grinevald 2002). Of the several unpublished
materials inspired by the workshops, an extensive word list by Eligardo Chirimani (1998)
deserves special mention. It needs to be said that without those workshops, the present
grammar may not have been written: it is because of the interest expressed by the Movima
participants that Movima was proposed to me as a language of research.
The present research project is part of the Spinoza project “Lexicon and Syntax” directed by
Pieter Muysken, which aims at describing as many of the language isolates in Amazonian
Bolivia and Brazil as possible. It is hoped that it will serve as a basis for the production of
materials that will help the Movimas to teach and learn their ancestral language.",[29]
"Apart from a bound pronoun, a possessor can additionally be encoded by a free pronoun or an
NP. The most productive way to encode the possessor by a free form is the addition of a
relative clause containing an oblique-marked pronoun, as in (2).

DM.n.p ART.n.p horse=1pl
REL obl-PRO.1pl
‘We had a horse of our own.’ [lit.: “There was our horse, which was of us.”]
{EA, Cbba 059}The free pronoun or NP can also occur directly after the possessed noun. This is similar to a
free pronoun encoding an argument of a clause, to be described in 7.3. The pronoun or NP can
either be unmarked, or it can be marked as oblique. It is not clear what the conditions are for
alternative marking, but the choice is not arbitrary. First of all, there are nouns on which the
possessor can only be expressed by the oblique pronoun, marked by the prefix n- (cf. 4.6), as
in (3)a. The use of an unmarked pronoun is ungrammatical, as shown by (3)b.
(3)228a. as

‘the house of yours’n-ulkwan
obl-PRO.2sgb. * as
ART.nulkwan
PRO.2sgroya=n
house=2{EC 16, 404a}With other nouns, it is only possible to express the possessor by the unmarked pronoun, as in
(4)a, but not by an oblique pronoun. The oblique pronoun can only occur in the relative
clause, as in (4)b:
(4)a. is
e: -a=n
ulkwan
ART.pl BR.name-LV=2 PRO.2sg
‘the name of yours’
b. is
e: -a=n
ART.pl BR.name-LV=2
‘the names of yours’di’ n-ulkwan
REL obl-PRO.2sg
{EA, 19, 266a}Judging from these examples, it seems that the distinction is conditioned by inherent
properties of the noun (cf. 6.2): a non-relational noun such as ro:ya ‘house’ in (3) can only be
combined with an oblique-marked possessive pronoun, whereas a relational noun such as e
‘BR.name’ is combined with an unmarked pronoun.115
However, the data are contradictory. For instance, the noun iwaniwansi ‘my way of
speaking’, a relational noun, is often found with the oblique pronoun, but cannot be combined
with the unmarked pronoun (cf. (5)).116 In contrast, some non-relational nouns, such as ju:ve
‘dugout’, can be combined neither with the unmarked nor, as would be expected, with the
oblique pronoun (cf. (6)). And finally, there are nouns which, despite being non-relational,
can be combined with the unmarked pronoun (cf. (7)).

All deverbal instrument nouns are relational, as will be shown in 11.1.6.
117
As will be shown in 6.2, the encoding of the first person is not obligatory with relational nouns. In (5),
therefore, the marker of the first person is omitted, only leaving the second-person marker =n to encode the first
person inclusive on the noun (cf. 4.1.2).
116229In all these examples, the version with the relative clause is preferred over the version with
the oblique pronoun only. Compare the following three examples with (3), (5), and (6),
respectively, above:
(8)(9)(10)as

REL{EC 16, 406a}{HR, TX 114}n-in a

{EA 19, 088}The form with the relative clause is always judged as “the best” by the speakers. The form
with the oblique-marked pronoun, which is used, but not preferred in elicitation, may,
therefore, be an elliptic version of the relative clause. In order to find out whether this is the
case, more nouns have to be tested for their relational status (cf. 6.2). Subsequently, the
different constructions in which possessed nouns can occur have to be systematized and tested
with all these nouns.","[251, 252, 253]"
"470While all predicate nominals can be reduplicated in order to function as the predicate of a
negative or subordinate clause, the suffix - e has a more limited distribution. First of all, the
form with - e occurs more often in negative than in subordinate clauses. The following
example illustrates this. In (16)a, the adjective tochi’ ‘small’ occurs in a negative clause with
the suffix - e. In (16)b, it is shown that in a subordinate clause, this suffix cannot be used.
Rather, the reduplicated form has to be used, as shown by (16)c (cf. also (8) above).

prototypical nouns are only rarely found with this suffix (cf. 3.10.4.3). The only text example
of a noun with the suffix - e in a negative clause is given in (17):
(17)jayna kas
don-’i- e=os
chi:~chi
DSC NEG blood-D-NMZ.N=n.p MD~go_out
‘It wasn’t blood anymore what came out.’{EA, Cbba 159}The reason why in (17), the predicate nominal don’i ‘blood’ is marked by - e and not by
reduplication, may be that when reduplicated, the word would be homophonous with the
inalienably possessed form. Recall from 3.7.5 and 6.4.1 that like action nominalization,
inalienable possession is marked by infixing reduplication. This is illustrated in (18) for the
same word as in (17) above. The sentence in (18) is the one which follows (17) in the
narration.

‘I had lost all my blood.’ [lit: “My blood was finished.”] {EA, Cbba 160}In this particular context, it is possible that the suffix - e is used in (17) in order to distinguish
the negated predicate nominal from the inalienably possessed noun in (18). However, it can
still be concluded that adjectives are more often combined with the suffix - e than nouns,
especially in negative clauses, so that the tendency to use - e on adjectives can be seen as a
distinction between the two word classes.
Before concluding the present section, I will briefly discuss verbs that contain the ending
-wa, but where this element does not have a nominalizing function. Examples include471tivijni:wa ‘feel pain’ (cf. (19)) and chajani:wa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)):

{EA, Tolkosya I 028}When these verbs are nominalized, the nominalizing suffix -wa is attached. This shows that
-wa in (19) and (20) above is not the nominalizing suffix, but part of the verbal base.

{HR, TX 088}While the verb chajaniwa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)) always occurs with the ending -wa, there is
also a verb tivijni ‘hurt’, derived from the noun ti:vij ‘pain’, which does not contain the
ending -wa. Here, a difference in meaning can be observed: the argument of the verb tivijni
‘hurt’ expresses the body part which hurts, whereas the argument of the verb tivijni:wa ‘feel
pain’ expresses the person or animal that feels pain. Compare (24) below, which contains the
nominalized form of the verb tivijni ‘hurt’, with (19) above, which contains the verb tivijni:wa
‘feel pain’. Apart from the difference in meaning, ‘hurt’ versus ‘feel pain’, the form in (24) is
a relational noun, while the one in (19) above is a monovalent verb.

to be productive, since only these two examples were found.","[493, 494, 495]"

nominalization, cf. 11.1), the words of the type shown in (87) usually undergo infixing

"9.2.5. Incorporated elements denoting an instrument
Occasionally, incorporated modifiers are found denoting an entity which is involved in the
event, but which is neither a part of the undergoer nor the Ground with respect to which the
event takes place. Since it denotes an entity that is involved, but not affected by the event, it
can be labelled “instrument”. As is the case with incorporated elements denoting the Ground
(cf. 9.2.4), the verb receives the applicative marker -e . The following examples illustrate this:384(66)jayna nis-na=is

Often, modifying incorporation involves the incorporation of a classificatory bound nominal
element (cf. 5.3.2, 5.3.4) that indicates a physical shape in which an action is carried out or
the shape of the product in which the action results. This process can have a similar function
as depictive predicates in languages like English. The incorporated bound root ew ‘BR.tail’
in the verb damoy ewna ‘braid’ in (70), for example, indicates that hair is twisted in a such a
way that it resembles a tail. And the incorporated bound root ba ‘BR.round’ in (71) indicates
that the action of chewing results in a round object.

chew-DR-BR.round=n.a ART.n.p again clothes
‘It [the cow] chewed my dress into a ball.’{EA, Cbba 089}This type of modifying incorporation resembles argument incorporation. The incorporated
elements are usually the same as those that can be incorporated as arguments, and in argument
incorporation, the type of undergoer is characterized inside the verb. However, like the other
types of modifying incorporation, the process discussed here creates verbs that are subject to
voice alternations.
Moreover, in difference to argument incorporation, the clause can usually not contain a
coreferential noun phrase, since the meaning of the incorporated element is often385metaphorically extended. For example, it would not be possible to replace the incorporated
element - ew in (70) by the noun e~ ew-kwa ‘tail’ (RED~BR.tail-ABS), since the undergoer
of the event is not a tail, but hair. Likewise, the verb danaba ‘chew into a ball’ in (71) does
not refer to an action affecting a round object, but to an action that results in a round object.
Argument incorporation is different in this respect, even though it can also have
classificatory features. In (72), the incorporated element classifies the patient as a roundshaped object, whose identity is specified by an external NP.

{EA, Basket 003}Examples (73) and (74) illustrate more cases of classificatory incorporation involving the
incorporated element -ba. Here, it also seems to be the case that the result of the action is a
round-shaped object, similar to (71) above.

{GB, Ganado 009}Example (75) is interesting in that it oscillates between classificatory incorporation and the
incorporation of a Ground-denoting element (cf. 9.2.4). On the one hand, the incorporated
element denotes the Ground with respect to which the action is carried out (‘to sit on an
animal’). This is also signalled by the applicative suffix -e (cf. 9.8.3). On the other hand, the
incorporated element does not denote the undergoer, but rather specifies the way in which the
action is carried out (‘as if sitting down on an animal’). Therefore, this is also a case of
classificatory incorporation.

keep apart. Furthermore, not only between the types of modifying incorporation, but also
between argument incorporation and classificatory incorporation, there seem to be quite a few
borderline cases. The fact that classificatory bound elements can not only represent386incorporated arguments, but are also productively used as modifiers, may be responsible for
the apparent lability or irregular valency properties of some incorporating verbs described in
9.1.3 above (in particular, (34)–(36)). It is possible that these cases represent a transition from
valency-reducing argument incorporation towards valency-retaining classificatory
incorporation, of the kind described by Mithun (1984).","[407, 408, 409, 410]"

{EA, Cbba 213}In all these cases, the form kwey clearly represents the focus marker (kaw), since its use as a
past-tense marker is ruled out by the context.
In order to focus on an argument and to indicate immediate past tense in the same clause,
kaw and kwey can cooccur. This is shown in (214) and (215) below. In (214), the particles can
be distinguished by their position. The clause-initial particle is the one that indicates past
tense, while the particle following the free pronoun is the focus marker kaw, in accordance
with the analysis of (206) and (207) above:

are often homophonous.
However, there are also cases in which the distinction between the two particles is difficult
to draw, and where a more detailed analysis is needed. This is especially the case when kwey
occurs inside a noun phrase that contains a verb, as in (217):

‘There was no one left who would look for (it).’sal-na
search-DR
{GC 18, 396}541In this example, the particle inside the NP can be identified as the focus particle kaw. This is
because the referent of the NP that contains a direct transitive verb, salna ‘search’, is not the
undergoer, as would be predicted from the voice marker -na (cf. 8.1.1, 8.2), but the actor. This
is the typical effect of the focus particle kaw, which demotes the former ARG2 from the
clausal core (cf. 7.8). If the focus particle were absent, or if the form kwey were the tense
marker, then the NP in (217) would denote the undergoer of the event, and the translation of
the clause would be ‘the (thing) I looked for was not there anymore’.
Example (218) is similar to (217) above. Here, the fact that the particle inside the NP is
realized as kaw serves as evidence that it is the focus marker and not the tense particle:

{GC 18, 394a}In other cases, where the exchangeability with /kaw/ was not tested, the element kwey within
an NP rather seems to be the tense particle. For example, in (219) below, the referent of the
NP containing a direct bivalent verb is the undergoer. The presence of the element kwey does
not have the effect of demoting the argument denoting the undergoer, as it does in (217) and
(218) above. Therefore, it probably represents the past-tense particle kwey.

"1.4. The situation of the language
It is conspiuous that despite the early loss of native indigenous culture, the Movima language
has been preserved until today. This can, in part, be attributed to the fact that the Jesuits
recognized the native languages and stimulated their use (cf. Crevels 2002: 13).8 However,
Movima has been maintained for at least two generations longer than many of its
neighbouring languages which were also spoken in Jesuit missions, such as the now possibly
extinct languages Canichana and Cayuvava.
This may have to do with the fact that Movima speakers are proud of their language. This
is, for example, reflected in their awareness of linguistic purity. I have never observed codeswitching in a conversation between native speakers. When I was involved in a conversation,
some passages were explicitly translated into Spanish for me. Mixing of Spanish and Movima
is disliked. Many people who do not have a full command of Movima prefer not to speak it.
While there are many Spanish loans in Movima, this is predominantly the case for nouns
denoting cultural items introduced by the Europeans. In at least one case, however, a Movima
noun has been replaced by the corresponding Spanish term because of its derogatory
connotation in Spanish. This is the Movima noun ku:lo ‘top’: since it is homophonous with
the familiar Spanish word ‘backside’, it has been replaced by the loan ari:wa, from Spanish
arriba ‘on top’ (Chirimani, p.c.).
Despite the long preservation of the language, Movima is seriously endangered today (cf.
Crevels 2002: 21): there are no more children learning the language, and most fluent speakers
are over fifty years olds. This sudden change, despite the maintenance of the language
throughout the process of acculturation and the contact with white people for 300 years, is
6This is a general phenomenon found in the Moxos region (cf. Crevels 2002: 21f.)
However, I use the term “Movima” here for the ethnic group only.

However, there are no written materials from the Jesuit times (cf. Montaño Aragón 1987: 241).
74probably due to the educational reform of 1955 (cf. Crevels 2002: 19). At that time, country
schools came into existence, where children were educated in Spanish and punished for using
their native language (Julia Malale p.c.). Most people from that generation, who are now 50
and older, did not pass the language on to their children. Therefore, most people of indigenous
origin between the age of 20 and 40 understand the language, but cannot speak it and are not
very interested in doing so. Some older people try to pass their knowledge on to their
grandchildren, but due to the Spanish-speaking surroundings, this has not been very
successful.
Since the last educational reform of 1992, Bolivian children are to learn the language of
their ancestors at school. However, this is not easily put into practice. One problem is the lack
of course materials for the smaller indigenous languages like Movima. Another problem is
that, ironically, many teachers who are assigned the task of teaching Movima do not speak the
language themselves. While the latter problem is largely bureaucratic in nature, it is hoped
that in the future, Spanish primers containing the most important grammatical features of
Movima, complemented by workshops, may help the teachers to understand the structure of
the language and to create school materials.9 The speakers and school teachers are very much
interested in this.","[27, 28]"

detached body part (cf. 6.6.3 below). Furthermore, in a possessive construction, some nouns
can undergo reduplication without there being a semantic difference with the unmarked form
(cf. 6.6.2 below).
132The suffix -kwi is very rare. It seems to be a variant of -kwa ‘ABS’.","[273, 274]"
"121.11. Presentation of the data
The presentation of the Movima data as well as the English translation given deserve some
explanation.
When a bivalent predicate in Movima is not combined with a cliticized referential element,
this automatically implies that the first argument is the first person singular. All bivalent
verbs, furthermore, have an implicit second argument, even though it is not obligatorily
overtly realized. Therefore, a simple bivalent verb without person marking is translated into
English as a full clause with a first person singular subject; the implied second argument is
always represented as “X”:
(1)sal-na‘I look for X.’Temporal categories are often not overtly indicated in Movima, but inferred from the context.
Hence, a clause unmarked for tense can imply any temporal category (past, present, future),
and example (1) can mean ‘I (have) looked for X,’ ‘I will look for X,’ etc. This is a problem
for the English translation, which I have solved as follows: examples where no context exists
(in particular, elicitation examples) are translated into the English simple present, even when
this does not sound like good English. Examples where a temporal context exists, even when
this cannot be seen in the example itself, are translated in a way which fits into this context
(e.g., ‘I looked for X’ in (1)). In many examples, the translation fits with the Movima data,
since tense is often reflected in the article.
An area where Movima displays finer differentiations than English is spatial deixis: articles,
pronouns and demonstratives always indicate whether a referent is present, absent, in
existence or out of existence. Unless relevant for the discussion, I do not reflect these
categories in the English translation:
(2)a. i’nes kwe:ya
b. kinos
kwe:ya
c.
ART.f woman
ART.f.a woman
‘the/a woman (present)’
‘the/a woman (absent)’
‘the/a woman’
‘the/a woman’isnos
kwe:ya
ART.f.p woman
‘the/a woman (deceased)’
‘the/a woman’Occasionally, I use the indices i and j when it is necessary to indicate whether two are
coreferential or not:
(3)di’ joy-sicha’kwa=‘ne joy-che --i’ne, jankwa=sne
HYP go-DES=f
go-R/R--f
say=f.a
‘If she i wants to go, she i goes, shej said.’In the English translations, I use round brackets (as in (2)a and b) for relevant information
implicit in the Movima example. Contextual information, which cannot be inferred from the
example, is given in square brackets:
(4)sal-na‘I look for [her].’Many particles indicating tense, aspect, and mood (henceforth TAM) and discourse particles13are hard to translate. For example, it is not clear how the particle rey in (5), which occurs in
almost every sentence, should be translated:
(5)bo
rey
ban-cho
os
ben‘i
REAS
again bare-BR.inside ART.n.p grassland
‘Because the savannah was flat (you know/of course?).’{EA, Cbba 164}Therefore, I often do not translate these particles.
Square brackets with dots […] in the Movima example mean that a part of the text has been
omitted.
It was necessary to employ special symbols representing different morphological processes.
Most are taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules of 2003, like those given in (6).13 Others,
shown in (7), are specifically introduced for the purpose of the present description.

--(internal) cliticization
external cliticizationAs suggested by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, I sometimes use a colon ( : ) in the glosses when
it is not practical to segment the Movima word. For example, when a morphologically
complex noun is incorporated into a verb, this process can be represented more adequately
when the different morphemes of the noun are not set apart. In (8), an example is given of a
complex noun (cf. (8)a) that is incorporated into a verb (cf. (8)b). From the glosses in (8)b, it
can be seen that the noun consists of several morphemes. In (8)c, the morphemes are
separated; here, it is not directly clear from the representation whether the suffix - e modifies
the verb or, as is actually the case, belongs to the noun.

‘And [the agouti] could be heard in its cave.’{EA, Jaguar 040}A question that might be asked is what would happen if the entities denoted by these nouns
had a first-person inalienable possessor (given an appropriate context), which would not be
encoded by an enclitic and which, therefore, would not trigger the linking vowel. The answer
is that even if it were possible for these nouns to denote a part of a human, i.e., a body part,
they would not be marked for possession in this way, but by reduplication of -kwa. This
process is described in 6.5.3, and the marking of body-part terms is described in 6.6.
When the suffix -kwa is omitted from a noun whose base has the structure CVCV, as is the
case with the nouns in (59)c., the base has to be augmented in a different manner. Due to the
vocalic ending of these bases, no linking vowel is attached which could create a base with
three moras. In order to achieve the required structure, these bases undergo infixing
reduplication. The reduplication creates a base of three syllables to which the enclitic is
attached:
(72)lo.si.si=is
lo<si~>si=is
resin<RED~>=pl.a
‘their resin (of the trees)’{EA 14, 083}This process is also applied to bases that already contain prefixing reduplication, as is the case
for some of the nouns listed under (59)c., e.g. ba~ba:-kwa ‘fruit’. When the suffix -kwa is
dropped here to create a possessive base, the remaining base ba~ba has to be additionally
reduplicated before the possessor is cliticized. This is illustrated by (73):

lok-a:- e

DSC
fall-DR-CO ART.pl RED~<RED~>BR.round=ART.n tree
‘I made the fruits fall off the tree.’
{JM 16, 372b}Note that, even though these nouns denote inalienably possessed entities, I analyse the
infixing reduplication here as a purely phonological process, not as the marker of inalienable
possession described in 6.4.1. This is because, with regard to nouns ending in -kwa, the
reduplication is only found on bases with the form CVCV. If it were a semantically relevant
derivation, the infixing reduplication would be found on the other bases, too.
Other bound roots that denote parts of wholes and display the same behaviour were given in
5.3.2.1. In difference to the bases described here, however, those roots do not normally occur
with the suffix -kwa.","[269, 270]"
"The name of the languageThe term Movima, pronounced [mo’ ima] in Spanish, originally refers to the ethnic group
that speaks this language. The native term is mowi:maj, pronounced [m 'wi:mah].
The Movima language is referred to by Spanish-speaking locals as el idioma (‘the
language’) or el dialecto (‘the dialect’). In Movima, it is called chonsine (‘native language’,
literally ‘right sound’), a term also used to refer to other native languages. More specifically,
the language is referred to as chonsine di’ mowi:maj (‘native language Movima’).
Movima is the only name known for the language. Only minor spelling differences are
encountered in the literature. In the first written record, from 1621 (cf. 1.3 below), it is
referred to as “moyma” or “moima”. Créqui-Montfort & Rivet (1914) spell it “mobima”. All
these spellings are more or less faithful to the pronunciation of the word (<v> and <b> in the
Spanish spelling represent the phoneme / /). However, Métraux (1942) confusingly spells it
as Móvima, with an accent on the o. Since stress is on the penultimate syllable, this must be a
misspelling.
Dialectal varieties of the language have not yet been discovered.",[24]

This book is a description of Movima, a genetically unclassified language spoken in the
Amazon area of Bolivia. This book is intended for linguists from different backgrounds, and
is not based on any particular theoretical framework.
In the present chapter, I will give general information on Movima and its speakers. This
includes the historic, geographic and sociolinguistic background, previous research on the
language, and information on the fieldwork and data on which the present study is based. In
addition, I will give an overview of the main characteristics of Movima by comparing them to
characteristic features of other Amazonian languages. The final two sections give an outline
of the structure of the book and of the way in which the data are presented.","[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"7.6. Oblique arguments
The only case distinction in Movima is made between structural and oblique case. Structural
case is unmarked and identifies core arguments. Oblique case is indicated by the prefix n- on
the referential element (cf. 4.6). Consider the pair of examples in (98), which illustrates the
difference between an unmarked (a.) and an oblique-marked (b.) NP:
(98)a. usko
bay-a-cho=us
PRO.m.a knock-DR-BR.inside=m.a
‘He broke the glass.’as

PRO.m.a knock-DR-BR.inside=m.a
‘He broke X inside the glass.’n-as
wa:so
obl-ART.n glass{EA 6, 162b}{EA 6, 162b}The interpretation of the oblique argument depends on the construction, on the semantic
properties of the predicate and the argument, and on the context. To illustrate the variable
interpretation of the oblique argument, four clauses are presented in (99) which each contain
the same verb, chi:chi ‘go out’, and an oblique argument. The oblique argument encodes a
goal in (99)a, a source in b, a temporal adjunct in c, and a purpose in d:

{EA, Tolkosya I 033}281The examples in (100) show the same phenomenon with the oblique argument of the
monovalent verb kaykay ‘eat’. In (100)a, the oblique argument is the patient, in b, it is an
accompanier, in c., it is a source, and in d., it is a temporal adjunct.

clauses with an oblique argument. In (101), the oblique NP refers to a location and in (102), to
an instrument.

{EA, Antojos II 003}{EA, Parabas 036}Since a clause in Movima can maximally have two core arguments, as was shown in (1)
above, one of the arguments of a verb denoting an event with three participants has to be
oblique. Here, it becomes apparent that Movima is a primary-object language (cf. Dryer
1986), since the agent and the recipient are core arguments, while the theme is marked as
oblique. This can be seen in (103) and (104):
(103)os

‘Then shei showed me herj dress – full of mud!’282Oblique-marked NPs and pronouns can form ascriptive predicates (cf. 7.9.3) and adverbial
clauses (cf. 7.12.3).
Note that in my definition, “oblique arguments” contrast with “core arguments” in Movima.
This terminology is not intended as a theoretical statement. It contrasts with Van Valin &
LaPolla (1997:29), who make it clear that oblique arguments also belong to the core, so that
these terms should not be mutually exclusive. Further research is necessary to show which
oblique-marked NPs or pronouns belong to the core in Movima clauses, and which ones are
peripheral constituents. A distinction would then have to be made between direct core
arguments, oblique core arguments, and peripheral constituents. However, I will not go into
this problem here.","[304, 305, 306]"
"Morphologically conditioned long vowelsIn 2.8.2, the basic rule for prosodic vowel lengthening was presented: in prinicple, the
penultimate open syllable of a word is lengthened, unless the word ends in a simple glottal
stop, while all other syllables of the word are short. There are, however, deviations from this
rule, in part predictable. They occur in the following order:
1. When an internal clitic is attached, the penultimate syllable is short.
2. The penultimate syllable is long when it belongs to a loan or when it is a
monosyllabic root.
The first rule was illustrated in 2.9.1 above. The case of loans was shown in 2.8.3. Here, I will
argue that other deviant cases are often due to the fact that the irregularly long syllable is the
root of the word.
A monosyllabic root always consists of a heavy syllable, i.e. either a closed or a long open
syllable. Neither its position in the word nor the presence or absence of an internal clitic
influence syllable length in this case. In (211), this is illustrated with respect to the root /de:/
‘lie’. The examples in (211)a show the retention of vowel length before an internal clitic,
(211)b the retention of vowel length in initial position of longer words, and (211)c its
retention in word-final position.33
33Historically, the morpheme /de:/ ‘lie’ probably had the form /deje/ or /daj/; it is pronounced as [ j ] by some
speakers when it forms part of demonstratives, e.g. [k ' :] ~ [k 'd j ] ‘that (nonstanding). The form / aj/ is
found before a bound element, as in /daj+' aba / ‘to lie on the ground’, and in the durative nonstanding aspect56(211)a. /'de:na/

‘her bed’:wawan' a:ni] ‘bedstead’
:'t ihni]
‘to sleep together’[k ' :]
[n s' :]‘that (nonstanding)’
‘over there’(DM.nst.n)Other examples of semantically clearly identifiable monosyllabic roots are /ba:/ ‘finish,
complete’ (cf. (212)) and /ku:/ ‘long’ (cf. (213)), shown in longer words:
(212)/ba:'lo:mah/
[ a:'l :mah]
‘to finish’
/ba:'lo:si/
[ a:'l :si]
‘its resin is finished’
/ba:pu'laj /
[ a:pu'laj i]
‘to finish sweeping’
/ba:tihkarim'kaka / [ a:tihka im'kaka ] ‘to finish working’(213)/ku:'ri:di/
/ku:' a:ri/
/ku:'tek/[ku:' i: i]
[ku:' a: i]
[ku:'t ]‘long stick’
‘long leg’
‘long breath’Some monosyllabic roots can occur in a closed syllable. Only in this case is their vowel
shortened. Cases in point are /e / ‘BR.name’, which has a final consonant, and /kwa/ ‘mouth’,
which is followed by the linking nasal when a suffix is attached (cf. 2.9.3). The examples in
(214)a and (215)a show that when an internal clitic is attached, the vowel of these roots is
long, as is the case with the roots in (211)–(213). This is due to their root status and to the
position of the vowel in an open syllable. The examples in (214)b and (215)b show that when
the vowel appears in a closed syllable, however, it is short.
(214)a. /e:' asne/

mouth:LN:D
['kwan i]
‘my mouth’Compare these roots to the phonologically similar bases /e a/ ‘comb’ (cf. (216)) and /kana/
‘food’ (cf. (217)), respectively. These roots are disyllabic and therefore obey to the normal
marker /da'jak/. Similar historical connections could explain the constant retention of vowel length in other
monosyllabic roots.","[79, 80]"
"412cases, the possessor of the affected entity is encoded as ARG2. The example contains a
sequence of five transitive clauses. The predicate of the first clause is a simple bivalent verb
( ap-u’-na ‘I wash X well’), followed by three bivalent verbs with an incorporated modifier.
The predicate of the last clause is a verb with an incorporated argument and the applicative
suffix -e .

‘I bathe them all well, I rub them (their skin), I soap them (their heads), then I wash
them (their heads), I change them (their clothes).’
{EA, Nietos 002}I will now turn to the comparison between the suffixes -e ‘APPL’ described here and - e
‘CO’ described in 9.7 above. These suffixes are similar in that they both have and applicative
function and can be attached to verbs containing an incorporated argument. However, there is
a crucial difference. First of all, observe the different structures of bases containing these
suffixes, represented in (199):
(199)a. VR + -a + incorporated argument + -e
(described here)
b. VR + -a + incorporated argument + - e + -na (cf. 9.7.1 above, (164)–(166))The two structures are illustrated in (200) and (201). In (200), which corresponds to the
pattern in (199)a, the verbal base is put in square brackets in order to illustrate the point that
will be discussed below.

‘I’ll wash my husband’s clothes.’{EA, 14, 216}us

ART.m spouse
{EA 14, 132}In both constructions, a monovalent base that contain an incorporated argument undergoes a
valency increase. However, the suffix - e ‘CO’ is attached to a complex verb with an
incorporated argument in the same way as to any other monovalent base, as indicated by the
square brackets in (200). The direct marker -na is then added to create a semantically bivalent
verb, so that the newly introduced co-participant can be encoded as ARG2. The suffix -e
‘APPL’, in contrast, does not take an additional bivalent voice marker. Rather, it demotes the
grammatical function of the incorporated element from that of an argument to that of a
modifier (cf. 9.2 above). Therefore, on the resulting verb, it is the original bivalent voice
marker, obligatory for argument incorporation, that marks the verb as semantically bivalent.
However, note that here, this marker cannot be dropped to create a monovalent verb,
something which is possible with modifier incorporation.","[435, 436]"

Many people have helped me get this work done. First and foremost, my gratitude goes to
Pieter Muysken, who has made this project possible by hosting it within his Spinoza
programme “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Not only did I
benefit from his insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript, which were always
to the point and opened new lines of thought for me. He also gave me the feeling that
whatever problem there would be on the way, he would try to help out. Whenever I
approached him for linguistic or non-linguistic advice, I got an open ear, no matter whether it
was the right moment or not. His confidence in this project and his constant encouragement
were an enormous support.
I was also very lucky in that during the entire project, I had Rik van Gijn as my office mate.
This meant lots of fun, discussions, and the possibility to exchange experiences on life in the
linguistic world. My work has benefited greatly from Rik’s insights and from his talent to
present things systematically.
Hein van der Voort, occasional office mate, advised me in many ways. In particular, I am
very grateful for his extremely detailed, critical and helpful comments on the entire
manuscript.
I owe many thanks to Mily Crevels, who has helped me a lot especially at the beginning of
this project. In particular, Mily accompanied me to Santa Ana in 2001, and through her I got
acquainted with the people who became my closest friends there. With respect to field work
and dealing with practical matters in the Beni, Mily gave me the most valuable advice.
Outside the Spinoza group, I want to thank the following linguists for commenting on
earlier drafts of specific chapters of this book, for discussing the data with me, and/or for
advising me on particular topics: Willem Adelaar, Martin Böhler, Werner Drossard, Dan
Everett, Mats Exter, Ad Foolen, Colette Grinevald, Carlos Gussenhoven, Birgit Hellwig,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, Helen de Hoop, Haike Jacobs, Leonid Kulikov, Geraldine Legendre,
Andrej Malchukov, Maarten Mous, Doris Payne, Hans-Jürgen Sasse, René Schiering, Anna
Siewierska, Leon Stassen, and Fernando Zúñiga. I am especially grateful to Werner Drossard,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, and Hans-Jürgen Sasse for the long and inspiring discussions on the
Movima voice and valency system, whose essence I would probably never have understood
otherwise. My particular gratitude also goes to Willem Adelaar and Carlos Gussenhoven for
discussing earlier versions of the phonology chapter with me, and for their patience in
answering my numerous questions on the topic. In addition, I am deeply indebted to Willem
Adelaar for his valuable comments on the entire manuscript. And Maarten Mous is especially
thanked for sitting with me for hours when I was desperate and did not know how this work
could ever come to an end.
Pilar Valenzuela is acknowledged for pointing out Movima to me as a possible language of
research.
I furthermore want to thank the participants of the Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen for
their comments on my talks, in particular Jürgen Bohnemeyer, Swintha Danielsen, Martina
Faller, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Girón, Katja Hanss, Roland Hemmauer, Sergio Meira,
Loretta O’Connor, and Frank Seifart. And without the critical questions from the participants
of my “Strukturkurs Movima” at the Linguistics Department in Cologne, some problems and
contradictions in my analyses would hardly ever have become apparent to me.iWhile it was not possible to integrate into the present work all the comments I got, they
highly increased my insight into the Movima grammar.
My research has also benefited greatly from the open and friendly atmosphere at the
Linguistics Department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. My thanks go particularly to
Helen de Hoop, Monique Lamers, Peter de Swart, Andrej Malchukov, Joost Zwarts, Wilske
Driessen, Janine van der Zijl, Else Havik, Margot van den Berg, and Marleen van de Vate.
It is hard to express my gratitude adequately to the Movima speakers who contributed the
data on which this grammar is based. Their hospitality and their willingness to teach me their
language were overwhelming.
First of all, I want to thank Esaltación Amblo Ovales, who took upon herself the task of
teaching me Movima. She is the best teacher I could have imagined, with her clarity of
pronunciation, her great memory, and her readiness to talk to me in Movima about all kinds of
topics. I am also grateful to her sister Etelvina and her cousin Modesta for receiving me in
their house with so much friendliness.
My thanks go furthermore to Julia Malale Humasa, my principal teacher during my first and
my last stay. Good-humoured and funny, yet serious when it came to analysing her language,
she is a delightful instructor.
I owe many thanks to Eligardo Chirimani Malue for working with me every day right from
the beginning. Without his linguistic insight and his careful judgment, it would never have
been possible to create such a large and useful text database. Apart from that, it is mainly due
to the fact that he and Melvin Rossel Yoqui took so much interest in maintaining their native
language that this research was carried out at all. The other members of the Subcentral
Indígena Movima are also acknowledged for supporting this project throughout.
I am furthermore grateful to Griselda Cáumol, Balvina Almaquio, Herlan Rojas, Ela Rossel,
Nelly Gualusna, Peregrina Cayú, Dora Vargas, Delmira Masaro, Nataniel Cáumol, Eleuterio
Mole, Alejandro Yónima, Juan Hualima, Bernarda Gualusna, María Esaltación Sepi, and Luis
Yalauma for teaching me their language.
Most of my teachers I would never have met without the help of Janeth Cayalo. She took
me with her on her motorbike every day during the beginning of my field work to find
consultants. I am deeply grateful to her.
This leads me to other friends in Santa Ana without whom my stays there would have been
much less effective and pleasant. Elsita Asbún, Esperanza Cayalo, Sonia Rivero, and Graciela
Rodríguez helped me in all aspects of daily life and became dear friends. Olga Arteaga and
her family provided a home for me for most the time, and their parrot was my most faithful
companion and probably the only one who learned words from me. I am also indebted to
Milton Villavicencio and his wife Loida for their great hospitality.
Outside Santa Ana, I especially want to thank Dr. Carlos Patiño Kühn in Santa Cruz for
taking my health worries off my back. Gudrun Birk is thanked for digging with me in the
APCOB library.
Last but not least, I want to thank my parents for their strong support at all times. My
friends in Cologne took up with my unusual lifestyle with much understanding. And my
deepest gratitude is with Harald Stoffels, who accompanied me towards and throughout this
entire project, and who is the main responsible for the fact that the years of thesis writing
were very happy years.iiContents

"2356.3.3. The overt marking of non-relational nouns
Some morphemes overtly mark a noun as non-relational. The most common marker is the
suffix -kwa. As was already shown in 5.3.2, when occurring on a body-part term, this marker
indicates detachment and nonpossession:123
(25)a. di:noj
cho:ra
kwinto
woro’‘my upper leg’
‘my eye’
‘my cheek’
‘my throat’b. dinoj-kwa
‘detached leg’
chora-n-kwa ‘detached eye’
kwinto:-kwa ‘detached cheek’
woro’-kwa ‘detached throat, neck’As could already be seen in 5.3.2 with respect to bound roots, the suffix -kwa occurs on many
bases which otherwise cannot occur independently. I will come back to these nouns in 6.5
below.
Another suffix which derives non-relational from relational nouns is the complex
instrumental suffix -wanra or -wanrani (cf. 11.4).124 With some nouns, this suffix is necessary
in order to encode a nonpossessed entity:
(26)do’we-wanra:-ni
my.clothes-INSTR:BE.ntr-PRC
‘clothes (of someone, not mine)’(27)de-wa-wanra:-ni
lie-?-INSTR:BE.ntr-PRC
‘bed, bedstead (not mine)’(28)e -wanra
BR.name-INSTR:BE.ntr
‘name’Consider also the following example, in which the speaker refers to the drawing of a finger
with a ring on it:
(29)kowa
da’
as
dimpa-n-wanra:-ni
DM.el.n
DUR.nst ART.n finger-LN-INSTR:BE.ntr-PRC
che as
sortija=a
and ART.n ring=n
‘There is a finger and its ring.’{EA12, 285}Another complex suffix, -wawankwa, has the function of converting kinship terms into more
general terms. The resulting noun denotes the status of a person as a parent, grandparent etc.,
without relating that person to another one.125123Nonpossession is relevant here. As a speaker pointed out to me, the noun dimpa-n-kwa ‘detached finger’, for
example, can only be used when referring to a cut-off finger which is not one’s own.
124
Note, however, that nouns containing the suffix -wanra are relational when derived from a verb (cf. 11.1.6).","[258, 259]"
"5.3.2. Bound roots
Bound roots are noun roots which cannot occur independently. Usually, this is due to the fact
that they are monosyllabic. These roots either occur in combination with other roots (in
compounding or incorporation), or they are otherwise augmented. There are three types of
augmentation which enable a bound root to occur as a morphological head: reduplicated, the
combination with the dummy element -‘i, and the combination with the absolute-state suffix
-kwa. These types of augmentation are of limited productivity and mainly depend on the root.
I will describe the three processes in turn.
5.3.2.1.Reduplication of relational noun roots
Some noun roots, all of which denote inalienably possessed entities, can only occur as
independent nouns when reduplicated. These are the following:
(56)cho
duk
loba
loto
lowe
mosi‘BR.inside’
‘BR.back’
‘BR.body’
‘BR.ear’
‘BR.colour’
‘BR.lower back’Examples (57)–(59) illustrate the occurrence of these roots attached to a lexical base:
(57)(58)mere’
rey son-lo:ba
big
again other-BR.body
‘a big heap of their clothes’di’ do’we=is
REL clothes=pl.aos
tochi’ salon
ban-duk-a=y’ i
ART.n.p small gun
put-BR.back-LV=1pl
‘The small gun, we had put it on our backs.’{PM, Empleada 030}{BA, TX 225}205(59)jayna
chak-a:-cho
buka’
kis
DSC
pierce-DR-BR.inside DUR.mov ART.pl.a
‘Then you go making holes.’si -kwa
BR.hole-ABS
{EA, Chaco I 045}In order to occur as independent nouns, the relational bound roots undergo reduplication. For
the disyllabic roots, this is a single infixing reduplication:
(60)as
lo<ba:~>ba
ART.n body<RED~>
‘my body’(61)is
lo<to:~>to
ART.pl ear<RED~>
‘my ears’(62)as
lo<we~>we=a
ART.n colour<RED~>=n
‘its colour’The monosyllabic bound roots, -duk ‘back’ (cf. (63)) and -cho ‘inside’ (cf. (64)) undergo a
second reduplication when occurring independently. Since I do not assume that two
reduplicative prefixes can cooccur (cf. 3.7.1), my analysis of these forms is that prefixing
reduplication comes first, and that the resulting form undergoes infixing reduplication.
(63)as
du~<du:~>du’
ART.n RED~back<RED~>
‘my back’(64)as
cho~<cho~>cho=as
ART.n RED~inside<RED~>=ART.n
‘the underside of the table’me:sa
tableSome nouns encoding inalienably possessed entities can be recognized as historically
consisting of a bound root which has been reduplicated in this way. A case in point is the term
for ‘waist’, the root of which has not been found outside this word. The only form in which it
occurs is with two reduplications, as in (65).
(65)as
kwi~<kwi~>kwi=u
ART.n RED~<RED~>waist=m
‘his waist’As far as the root -duk ‘BR.back’ is concerned (the only root in this group which consists of a
closed syllable), the double reduplication only occurs with the first-person singular possessor,
in which case the noun is not combined with an enclitic (cf. 4.1; see also (63) above). When it
is combined with an enclitic, which triggers the appearance of the linking vowel -a, only one206reduplicated element remains. Since I postulate prefixing reduplication as the earlier process,
it is this one which remains:
(66)as
du~duk-a=n
ART.n RED~back-LV=2
‘your back’5.3.2.2.Bound roots with -‘i
Some simple nouns consist of a monosyllabic root and the dummy element -‘i. The following
are the cases found so far:97
(67)ris-’i
kwa-n-’i
chaj-’i
don-’i
nun-’i
maw-’i
dam-’i
rum-’i
kwa’-’i
baw-’i
paj-’i
ben-’i‘my ankle’
‘my mouth’ (-n ‘LN’)
‘my breast(s)’
‘blood’
‘bone’
‘hunger’
‘louse’
‘parasite’
‘night heron’
‘night jar’
‘dolphin’
‘countryside, grassland’ (-ben ‘BR.flat, flexible’)The fact that the element -‘i is not an integral part of these words, but only serves the purpose
of creating a phonologically acceptable independent noun, can be seen when these words
form part of a compound (cf. 5.2) or are incorporated (cf. 9.1, 9.2). In this case, usually only
the roots remain:
(68)(69)(70)punta:-nun
tip-BR.bone
‘the bone from the tip [of the rib cage]’
oy-baw
two-BR.night_jar
‘two night jars’
kayni:-maw
die-BR.hunger
‘to die of hunger’{EA, Huesos 013}{JM 18, 109}{AH, Dial. EA&AH 131}97All nouns ending in -‘i, including those whose root is not found in other environments, are listed in Appendix
A.I.","[228, 229, 230]"
"486construction with -ti’ in (91)b has a far more specific meaning: it denotes the construction of a
wheel only.
(91)a. jisa:-na
kos
kare:ta
make-DR ART.n.a oxcart
‘I build the/an oxcart.’b. kareta:-ti’
oxcart-VBZ
‘to make an oxcart-wheel’As could be seen from the examples above, the suffix -ti’ is extremely productive. However,
it cannot be attached to certain nouns that denote entities which cannot be produced or
modified in any way:
(92)* benra-n-ti’
sky-LN-VBZ
(‘to make a sky’)However, the noun lu’lu’ ‘rain’, which may be considered as belonging to the same category,
is always verbalized by -ti’. Possibly, this is because there exists an event that is typically
associated with rain:
(93)lu’-ti’ ‘to rain, to be raining’ (rain-VBZ)When a noun denotes an entity that cannot be produced, the suffix -ti’ indicates that an object
similar to that encoded by the noun is produced:
(94)champa:-ti’
stone-VBZ
‘to make something like a stone’ (e.g., a grinding stone of wood)Nounlike adjectives (cf. 3.10.4) cannot be verbalized by the suffix -ti’, as shown by the
ungrammaticality of (95). Adjectives can be verbalized by the bivalent direct voice marker
-na (cf. 11.8 and 8.1.1).
(95)*mere’-ti’(‘to make a big one’?)(big-VBZ)From the morphological point of view, there are only few restrictions on the kinds of nominal
bases to which the suffix -ti’ can be attached. In (96), the suffix is attached to an instrumental
noun (cf. 11.4):
(96)kuynana’-wampoy-ti’
play-INSTR:BR.animal-VBZ
‘to play with the bulls at the corral’ [lit.: “to do something with play-animals”]
{EA, Visita 002}When -ti’ is attached to a noun that contains the absolute-state suffix -kwa, the suffix -kwa is
either omitted or retained. This depends on the possessive relationship between the actor and487the entity denoted by that noun. When the relation is that of inalienable possession, the suffix
is replaced by the verbalizer, as in (97):
(97)mori-n-ti’
jo -ti’
ba~ba -ti’‘to blossom [a plant]’
(BR.blossom-LV-VBZ)
‘to lay eggs [a hen]’
(BR.egg-VBZ)
‘to build the nest [a bird]’ (RED~BR.cover-VBZ)Note here that the verbalizing suffix is not attached to the noun root, but to the base from
which the suffix -kwa is omitted. Otherwise, the last word in this list would have the form
ba -ti’ instead of ba~ba -ti’.262
When there is no relationship of inalienable possession, the absolute-state suffix -kwa is
retained on these bases:
(98)mo~mo -kwa:-ti’
RED~BR.shell-ABS-VBZ
‘to make shells (i.e., to peel eggs or something similar in order to obtain shells)’(99)jo -kwa-n-ti’
BR.egg-ABS-LN-VBZ
‘to make an egg’The denominal verb formed by the attachment of -ti’ behaves like a monovalent verb. This
means that before further suffixes, the ending -ti’ is dropped (cf. 8.7). The meaning of the
base is that of the denominal verb, not that of the noun alone (cf. also 3.10.2).263 In (100)–
(102), this is shown for nominalized forms (cf. also (39) above):(100)(101)(102)a. jo -ti’
egg-VBZ
‘to lay eggs’b. n-as

jema’a
jaguar-VBZ
jaguar-AG
also
‘to hunt jaguars’
‘[They] (were) jaguar-hunters, too.’{BA, TX 270}Example (103) shows a verbalized noun with the applicative suffix - e (cf. 9.7):
262This is the same process as that found in possessor encoding on these bases (cf. 6.4.2).
Since the meaning of the verbalizing suffix -ti’ is retained in these words, while the suffix itself is not overtly
present, these cases may be analysed as containing a zero allomorph -ti’. Before postulating a zero allomorph
here, however, it needs to be investigated whether this is also possible for the other monovalent verbal
morphemes that are dropped before further suffixation (cf. 8.7.1).
263488(103)a. juve-n-ti’
b. loy i juve- e:-na
dugout-VBZ
ITN 1 dugout-APPL-DR
‘to build a dugout’
‘I’ll help X build a dugout.’{EA 14, 213}More examples of denominal verbs derived through -ti’ which are subsequently combined
with verbal morphemes were given in 3.10.2.
Even though the suffix -ti’ is dropped before further suffixes are attached, forms like those
in (100)–(103) are not semantically ambiguous. This is because all other verbalizing suffixes
are retained before another suffix is added, as will be shown in the following sections.
Furthermore, a nominalized predicative noun is never nominalized through the attachment of
the suffix -wa, but by reduplication (cf. 11.1.1 above). Therefore, the form in (100) cannot
mean something like “when it is an egg”.
Attaching the nominalizer -wa to the verbalizing suffix is ungrammatical:
(104)* ko’o-ti’-wa
tree-VBZ-NMZ
‘making firewood’As with monovalent verb roots, the attachment of the direct voice marker -na to a verbalized
noun creates a bivalent verb that denotes an action whose undergoer is a location, not a
patient. This can be seen in (105)–(107):
(105)n-a
chon ko’o:-na
obl-ART.n.1 HAB tree-DR
‘at the (place where) I always make my firewood’{EA 6, 235}(106)n-as

‘at their (place of) making pots’(107)asko
chammo=is

bay im-na=y’ i
PRO.n.a bush=pl.a
ART.n.p field-DR=1pl
‘It (was) their forest, the (place where) we made our field.’ {EA, Vida chaco 018}Note that these forms, in contrast to the forms nominalized by -wa (cf. (100), (101)), can be
ambiguous, since nouns can also be verbalized by the direct voice marker (cf. 11.8 below).
Here, it is the context which identifies the status of the word.","[509, 510, 511, 512]"

{Dial. EA&EG}
Context information:
The following is a spontaneous conversation between two sisters, EG and EA, during an
elicitation session with EA. Occasionally, I am involved in the conversation as well (KH).
EG earns some money sweeping the church. The conversation starts when she has just
arrived at home after sweeping. The priest had promised to pay the sweeping women that day,
and she has been waiting for him for quite a while, but he hasn’t come down from his room in
the parish building.
This is annoying for EG for several reasons: instead of waiting, she would have preferred to
go to the corral, where the rodeo took place during the fiesta, to see if it is being torn down;
when one helps tearing it down, one receives some beams and planks in turn. And she would
also have liked to come home earlier, because there had been visitors. The now adult daughter
of a relative had come for the first time, and everyone had been very curious to meet. EA tells
EG about the visit, not without pointing out that EG should have tried to come earlier.
The problem of the corral is discussed in 001–022 and 085–106. The middle part, 023–068,
is about the visit.","[584, 585, 586, 587, 588, 589, 590]"
"9.1.2. Properties of the incorporated element
While the previous section described verbal bases that incorporate an argument, the present
section discusses the types of elements that can be incorporated in the process of argument
incorporation.
At the beginning of this section, examples were given that show that argument
incorporation can involve a full noun, such as saniya ‘melon’ in (1), rulrullo ‘jaguar milk’ in
(3), or jo’me ‘bird’ in (4). It can also involve a bound nominal element, i.e. a bound root, such
as mova ‘BR.litter’ in (2), a truncated form, such as -do ‘TRC.plate’ in (5), or an unanalysable
bound element, such as -ra ‘firewood’ in (6). The reasons for the choice of either a full noun
or a bound form are not entirely clear. I will outline some basic criteria.
First of all, for some nouns, there exists no corresponding short form, such as a bound root,
truncated element, or other. These nouns can only be incorporated in their independent form,
as in the following examples:
(15)n-os
chon pul-a-lolos-wa=y’ i
obl-ART.n.p HAB sweep-DR-yard-NMZ=1pl
‘always when we swept the yard …’(16)loy in
nis-a-wenta:na
ITN 1intr wipe_clean-DR-window
‘I’ll wipe the window clean.’n-os
lo:los
obl-ART.n.p yard
{EA, Aros II 032}{EA 13, 163}Nouns for which there is a corresponding bound form (cf. 5.3) can either be incorporated in
their bound or in their independent form. There is no categorial restriction on this: the free
noun and the bound element can be semantically equivalent, such as is the case, for example,
with po~poy-kwa ‘animal’ and poy ‘BR.animal’ (cf. (17) below), to:mi ‘water’ and -mi
‘TRC.water’, china a ‘manioc’ and -pa ‘BE.manioc’. The independent noun can also belong
to a taxonomic class which can be represented by a bound element; examples of these are371rulrul ‘jaguar’, which can be replaced by poy ‘BR.animal’, or jo’me ‘bird’, which can be
replaced by mo ‘BE.bird’.
In (17), a case where there is a semantically equivalent bound and free form (poy and
popoykwa, respectively), both these forms can be incorporated. The only overt difference
between the two constructions is that when the bound form is incorporated, the independent
NP can be added as an oblique argument (cf. (17)a). When the independent noun is
incorporated, the additional oblique NP is considered awkward (cf. (17)b).

RED~BR.animal-ABSni-kis
obl-ART.pl.apo~poy-kwa
RED~BR.animal-ABS
{EA 9, 045}The following is an example of both these constructions within one sentence, which occurred
in spontaneous discourse. The first part contains a (nominalized) verb with an incorporated
bound root (bun ‘BR.mud’) and the additional oblique NP nis bubunkwa. Here, the speaker
hesitates, not finishing the noun bubunkwa ‘mud’. She replaces the entire subordinate clause
by a clause whose predicate contains the full incorporated noun (bubunkwa ‘mud’).

‘They like to eat mu-, to eat mud.’ [a joke, speaking about dark chivé mass; lit.:
“They like the mud-eating of mu-, the mud-eating.”]
{JA, Tuncho 022}One motivation for the incorporation of a full noun instead of the corresponding bound form
may be the frequent homophony of bound elements (cf. 5.3.5). So, for example, the bound
element do can be used to refer to a plate (truncated from cha:do ‘plate’) as well to a large
round object (related to do~do:-kwa ‘big seed’). Accordingly, the verb in (19)a is more
specific than the one in (19)b, which can be made specific by adding a full NP:
(19)a. loy
in
loj-a-cha:do
ITN
1intr wash-DR-plate
‘I’ll wash the dishes.’
b. loy
in
loj-a:-do
(n-is
ITN
1intr wash-DR-TRC.plate obl-ART.pl
‘I’ll wash the dishes.’cha:do)
plate
{HR 15, 143}In some cases, there is a difference in meaning, depending on whether the full noun or the
bound element is incorporated; consider the following example, which suggests some372lexicalization when the bound element is incorporated:
(20)a. sal-a-to:mi
search-DR-water
‘to look for water (for drinking)’
b. sal-a:-mi
search-DR-TRC.water
‘to search for water underground (in order to dig a well)’ {GC 10, 155}The possibility of incorporating a full noun instead of a bound element into a verb may also
depend on the textual frequency of a verb with a particular bound element. This may be
related to the degree of institutionalization of the denoted action. For example, the complex
verbs in (21) and (22) are very frequent, and they denote institutionalized activities:
(21)a. il-a:-’oj
b. loj-a:-’oj
b. sit-a:-’oj‘to hang up clothes’
‘to do the washing’
‘to tailor’(spread-DR-BE.clothes)
(wash-DR-BE.clothes)
(sew-DR-BE.clothes)(22)a. ra -a:-pa
b. bo -a:-pa
c. ji -a:-pa‘to pull out (harvest) manioc roots’ (tear-DR-BE.manioc)
‘to scrape manioc’
(scrape-DR-BE.manioc)
‘to grate manioc’
(grate-DR-BE.manioc)In contrast, it seems that the full noun is often incorporated when the action denoted by the
verb is less closely connected to a specific type of undergoer. For example, the verb root duk
‘grind’ is freely combined with bound elements referring to entities that can be ground. The
incorporation of the full noun contrasts these different types of object.
(23)duk-a-china a
duk-a-kwajta’
duk-a-pe:re
duk-a-ro:so
etc.‘to grind manioc’
‘to grind maize’
‘to grind plantains’
‘to grind rice’(grind-DR-manioc)
(grind-DR-maize)
(grind-DR-plantain)
(grind-DR-TRC.rice)Grinding, however, the action denoted by verb root duk-, is most commonly associated with
cereals, e.g. rice. Therefore, it occurs most frequently with the incorporated bound element di
‘BR.grain’:
(24)duk-a:-di‘to grind cereals’Consequently, the less an action is associated with one particular type of undergoer, the more
productive full noun incorporation is with the verb denoting this action. Verbs with the root
sal- ‘search’ form a good example. The words in (25) are from texts, and elicitation has also373shown that all kinds of nouns can be inserted into a base formed with sal- ‘search’:214

{EG, Cazando 025}
‘to look for a path’
(to:wa ‘path’)
{DM, Dawjes 014}
‘to look for firewood’ (ko’o ‘tree, firewood’) {EA, Patrona 031}Certain nouns, however, cannot be incorporated. These are nouns with specific reference, like
proper names, kinship terms, or relational nouns (Ch. 6). In (26) and (27), the
ungrammaticality of verbs with an incorporated relational noun is shown:
(26)(27)* yey-a-bay im
want-DR-field
(‘to want/like one’s field’){EA 13, 112c}* il-a-do’we
spread-DR-clothes
(‘to spread one’s clothes’){JM 18, 052}Part of whole terms can only be incorporated as modifiers (cf. 9.2).
To sum up, argument incorporation has the following defining characteristics:
–
–
–It only occurs on semantically bivalent bases (containing -a/-na ‘DR’ or -cha ‘DR2’).
It creates a monovalent verb.
It is very productive with both full nouns and bound nominal elements.","[394, 395, 396, 397]"
"3.10.8. Referential elements
Referential elements, i.e., pronouns, articles, and demonstratives, described in Chapter 4,
form a morphological class of their own. These elements are unique in that they take the
oblique-marking prefix n- (cf. 4.6 and 7.6). No other word class can receive the oblique
prefix. As an illustration, this prefix is attached to a free pronoun in (267), to a demonstrative
in (268), and to an article in (269).

{JA, TX 129}The independent referential elements (free pronouns and demonstratives) are morphologically
more nounlike than verblike: they can be nominalized, for example when forming a
subordinate predicate, as in (270), or when negated, as in (271) and (272). In order to be
nominalized, however, they are first verbalized by the verbalizing suffix -ni (cf. 11.9). The
following examples illustrate nominalization of free pronouns:

‘I have a truck.’{JM 16, 349}The difference between the possessive construction with a demonstrative and the construction
with reduplication rather seems to lie in the discourse-pragmatic domain. It seems that the
construction with the reduplicated noun is used to focus on the possessum. An indication of
this is that in spontaneous use, the reduplicative construction is found most often in relative
clauses (cf. 7.11), as in (165) above and in (168), (169) below:

‘bones that have meat’{EA 12, 174c}Definite possession is either expressed by a relative clause (cf. 7.11) or by the predicateless
construction with an oblique constituent (cf. 7.9.3). In the latter construction, the possessum is
expressed by a free pronoun in topic position and the possessor by the oblique constituent, as
in (170) and (171):

free pronoun as well:

{EA, Escape 009}{EA, Mangas 007}297The construction with the possessor encoded by an oblique constituent, as in (170)–(173), is
generally restricted to cases in which the possessum is alienably possessed and is not
combined with an internal clitic (cf. 6.1). In addition to expressing a possessive relation, this
construction also puts focus on the possessor (“they are theirs”).
Possessive relative clauses are described in 7.11 below.","[319, 320, 321]"

{EA, Chaco III 021}The conditions for the occurrence or omission of the NP in a clause containing argument
incorporation require further investigation. In elicitation, speakers usually prefer the clause
with the oblique NP, considering it “more explicit”. It can be expected that the more generic
or semantically ambiguous the incorporated element is (cf. 5.3), the more likely it is for the
free NP to occur, while with an incorporated full noun (as in (112)), this is not the case (cf.
also 9.1). However, there are also examples such as (111), where the free NP cooccurs with a
full incorporated noun. This, in turn, may be due to the fact that the story was told to me and
not to a native speaker, so that the narrator sought to be as explicit as possible. Future
research on the cooccurrence of the incorporated noun and the independent NP will, therefore,
have to involve text counts of discourse data which were produced involving native speakers
only.
The following examples present further illustration of the use of argument incorporation.
Examples (112)–(115) are cases of occurrence of the same noun as incorporated element and
as an independent NP in adjacent clauses. In (113), the same verb root (wul-) occurs first with
an incorporated argument in an intransitive clause, and then with ARG2 as an independent NP
in a transitive clause. Note the different encoding of the second person: in the first clause, in
which the verbs contain incorporated arguments, it is encoded as ARGintr, i.e. by the proclitic
of Set 2. In the second clause, in which the arguments are not incorporated, the second person
is encoded as ARG1, i.e. by the enclitic of Set 1. From this, the first clause can be identified as
intransitive and the second as transitive.

{JA, TX 082}285The incorporated nominal element cannot be modified by a relative clause (cf. 7.11 below), as
shown by (116). In order to achieve modification or quantification of the incorporated
nominal element, an oblique NP has to be added, as in (117).

{EA 13, 260e}In modifier incorporation, the incorporation of the noun or nominal element does not
influence the valency of a verb. This is to say, a verb with an incorporated noun or bound
element can undergo voice alternations (cf. 9.2). This type of incorporation typically has a
limitative function (cf. Mithun & Corbett 1999): in the most typical case, the incorporated
element denotes the affected part of the undergoer, as in (118). In (118), it can also be seen
that a verb containing the direct voice marker remains bivalent (shown by the proclitic of Set
1 encoding the first person in (118)a); using a pronoun representing ARGintr, as in (118)b (the
proclitic of Set 2) is ungrammatical. A verb with an incorporated modifier is usually not
combined with a coreferential NP.

monovalent:

"4.9.2.2. On ground vs. elevated (Sets 1, 2 vs. Set 3)
While the demonstratives of Set 1 and Set 2 refer to objects located on the ground, the
demonstratives of Set 3 are used when the referent is located not on the ground, but at a
higher level. These demonstratives do not indicate the position of the referent. This can be
specified by a verb, as in (190)a and b:
(190)a. kowa
en-che
as
bote:liya n-as
si:ya
DM.el.n
stand-R/R ART.n bottle
obl-ART.n chair
‘The bottle is standing on the chair.’
{EA, DEM 040}181b. kowa
de:-che as
bote:liya n-as
si:ya
DM.el.n
lie-R/R ART.n bottle
obl-ART.n chair
‘The bottle is lying on the chair.’{EA, DEM 040a}The Set 3 demonstratives are used when the referent is located in such a way that there is no
contact with the ground. Ideally, the space between the ground and the referent (or the object
on which the referent is placed) can be seen. In (191)a and b, different demonstratives are
used according to the fact that in (191)a, the speaker can see the space between the referent
and the ground and therefore uses the Set 3 demonstrative, and in (191)b, she looks at the
referent from above and cannot see that space, and hence uses the Set 2 demonstrative:
(191)a. kowa
as
mi:chi
n-as

DM.nst.n ART.n cat

‘The cat is lying on the bench.’ [seen from above]{NG, DEM 227}{NG, DEM 227a}An object which is floating or swimming in the water is also referred to by the Set 3
demonstrative, since it is not in contact with the ground:

bi:law n-is
DM.el.n=DET
fish
obl- ART.pl
‘That fish is in the water.’to:mi
water
{EA, DEM 122}In contrast, when the object is on the bottom of the water, it is referred to by a demonstrative
of Set 1 or Set 2, as would be expected:
(194)kode:=s
champa n-is
DM.nst.n=DET stone
obl-ART.pl
‘The stone is in the water.’to:mi
water
{EA, DEM 123}When the object on which the referent is located is in contact with or attached to the ground,
the speaker can choose between a demonstrative of Set 1 or 2 (cf. (195)a) and a demonstrative
of Set 3 (cf. (195)b):182(195)a. as
china a kode:

ART.n manioc DM.nst.n put-BR.mouth:CO
n-as
bakwa-n- e:-kwa
obl-ART.n head-LN-CO-ABS
‘The manioc root is put on top of the stump.’{GC ph 023}{GC ph 023}When the referent is located in or on an object which is itself moveable (it can be called
“reference object”), the demonstrative is chosen according to the position of this object. This
was already illustrated by (186) and (187) above with respect to the encoding of mass entities.
The following is an example of a mass entity in a container:
(196)kilwa=s
to:mi nosde: kilwa
kwajles
DM.el.d.pl=DET water there DM.el.d.pl hot
‘That water [in a pot on a chair] over there is hot.’{EA, DEM 078}The following example shows that the location of the reference object is relevant also when
the referent itself is not visible:
(197)kowa=s
bote:liya da’
DM.el.n=DET
bottle
DUR.nst
‘The bottle is over there in your bag.’nokode:
n-as
bolso=n
over_there obl-ART.n bag=2
{EA, DEM 133}Thus, the choice between the Set 1/2 or Set 3 demonstrative depends on the location of the
reference object. When the reference object is itself located on the ground, the choice of either
the Set 1 or the Set 2 demonstrative depends on the orientation of the referent. This can be
seen in the following example:
(198)kode:
am-cho
as
bote:liya
DM.nst.n enter-BR.inside ART.n bottle
n-as
kanasta di’ en- a:ba
obl-ART.n basket
REL stand-BE.earth
‘The bottle is lying in the basket standing on the ground.’{ER, ph 022}88When forming part of a compound or when incorporated into a verbal base, I do usually not represent the
internal structure of complex nouns. The incorporated complex noun kwan e ‘top’ in (195)a and b can be split up
into kwa-n- e (BR.mouth-LN-CO). While it looks similar to the noun bakwa-n- e:-kwa ‘stump’, there is
probably no morphological relation. The complex noun bakwa-n- e:-kwa ‘stump’ (literally: “detached head of
something”), in turn, may be highly lexicalized; it was not found with any other meaning.","[204, 205, 206]"

{EA 9, 018a}The element jan- also occurs in the words jankwa ‘say’ and jampa ‘do’ (cf. 8.5.2), whose
final elements, -kwa and -pa, can be interpreted as the bound noun root ‘BR.mouth’ and as the
truncated form of the word cho:pa ‘hand’, respectively. To illustrated this, in (241) and (242),
these words are segmented in this way:

‘That’s how I do it.’{JM 16, 115}As can be argued for jankwa and jampa (cf. 8.5.2), the question words based on jan- can be
seen as morphological nouns. They are different from adjectives and verbs composed of a
root and an obligatory bound element (cf. 3.10.5) in that they receive person marking by an
internal clitic. Evidence for this is the fact that the second person is encoded by =n, as in
(238) and (240) above, a morpheme which only occurs in the set of internal clitics (cf. 4.1).
Also, the clitics are preceded by the linking vowel -a when the word ends in a consonant, as
in (238) and (239) above.58 In contrast, for verbs and adjectives, person marking by an
internal clitic is only possible when they contain a bivalent voice marker (cf. 8.1). Thus,
formally, words with the root jan- can be classed as relational nouns (cf. 6.3).
While words with the root jan- typically introduce a question, they can also occur in a
declarative clause (distinguished from questions by intonation, cf. 2.8.5). The words jankwa
and jampa, usually not used as question words (cf. (241), (242)), provide examples of this. In
(243), another example of a word with jan- in a declarative clause is given:57The function of the suffix -kwi in this context requires further research.
Stress does not help to identify the type of cliticization here, since interrogative sentences have a special stress
pattern.

in a particular type of question. This morpheme requires further research.
The root e - is used to mark questions which ask for the identity of a person or object. Like
jan-, it is obligatorily combined with a bound nominal element. However, it seems to be less
productive in this respect, and it is never combined with the semantically empty bound
element -ra. By default, it is combined with the bound root e ‘BR.name’:

illustrate this for the incorporated elements o:ra ‘hour’ (cf. (250)), poy ‘BR.animal’ (cf.

The question word e -e -, with the bound root e ‘BR.name’ (cf. (244), (245) above) seems
to be more lexicalized than the ones containing other bound elements. This is why, outside the
present chapter, I represent it as an unanalysable word. For example, the bound root e
‘BR.name’ is not preceded by a glottal stop, in contrast to its occurrence in other
constructions. Compare the pronunciation of the question in (253)a with the noun containing
the same bound root in (253)b:
(253)a. é -e -a=a
b. kem-’e -a=‘ne['
a a]
[k m ' a n ]‘What is it?’
‘her surname’Also, the question word e e - does not necessarily ask for a name. It can be used to ask for
more general information, as in (254) and (255):

‘What might have been wrong with them?’{HR, TX 190}The question marker e - can not only be combined with a bound nominal element, but also
with the subordinating particle jan ‘consequently’ (not related to the interrogative root jandescribed above). In a declarative utterance, this particle introduces an adverbial clause the
content of which was explained by the preceding discourse (cf. 7.12.6). The predicate of the
subordinate clause introduced by jan is nominalized by the suffix -na (cf. 11.1.3):

‘That’s why she came.’{EA, Visita 090}When jan is attached to the question root e -, as in (260) and (261) below, the syntactic
construction is the same as in the declarative clause (cf. (259)), and different from that of
questions introduced by e - in combination with a bound nominal element: the word is not
followed by an internal clitic, but by an oblique NP (underlined). The root e - in this
construction indicates that the speaker does not know the reason for the circumstance
described by the subordinate clause.

{HR, TX 314}To conclude, Movima does not have a clearly defined category of question words. The
elements which typically occur in questions have quite heterogeneous properties, and more
research is required as to their exact morphological and syntactic status. Probably the central
device for marking an interrogative utterance in Movima is intonation (cf. 2.8.5).","[145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150]"

"61.8. Field work, consultants, and data
While it has benefited from earlier publications, the present study is based entirely on my own
elicitation and text data. These were collected during four field trips to Santa Ana del Yacuma
between 2001–2004, amounting to approximately nine months in total. The initial contact was
with the Subcentral Indígena Movima. The speakers I mainly worked with were Esaltación
Amblo Ovales, Eligardo Chirimani Malue, and Julia Malale Humasa. Apart from Eligardo
Chirimani, the secretary of education of the Subcentral Indígena in 2001, I met my
consultants through private contacts.
I will briefly sketch the linguistic background of my three main consultants. Esaltación
Amblo was raised monolingually in Movima by her grandparents, who did not speak Spanish,
and learned Spanish as a teenager. Her knowlegde of Movima is renowned in the speaker
community. She permanently lives with relatives of the same age or older (mother, aunt,
sister, and several cousins), all of whom are native speakers, so that Movima is the principal
language spoken in the compound. Spanish is spoken only with the children and
grandchildren, who are not always at home. Julia Malale also has Movima as her first
language. She lives with her children and grandchildren, and it seems that Spanish is the
principal language spoken at home. Eligardo Chirimani grew up bilingually. He does not
speak Movima fluently, but understands and pronounces it perfectly and has excellent
judgement about the language. With him, I translated and analysed all the texts I transcribed.
Most elicitation was carried out with Esaltación Amblo in 2002 and 2003, who also
provided more than half of the texts on which this grammar is based. Julia Malale was my
main consultant during my first and my last stay. Other speakers with whom I had several
elicitation sessions were Griselda Cáumol, Herlan Rojas, Balvina Almaquio, and Ela Rossel.
In this way, I was able to check all my findings with at least two speakers. With a number of
other speakers I worked only sporadically. In Table 1, the contributors to this grammar are
listed. I generally paid per hour, a wage similar to that of a local teacher.11
I carried out the elicitation in Spanish, but did not use questionnaires or ask for translations
from Spanish. The technique I mainly used and which worked very well was setting up
(imagined) contexts. This was facilitated by the fact that the elicitation was carried out at the
speakers’ homes. For certain topics, I used elicitation stimuli developed by the Max PlanckInsitute for Psycholinguistics Nijmegen.1211Since for several reasons, payment in fieldwork is often a matter of debate, I have to stress that in my
particular field situation it proved to be a very good basis for working together. Also people who did not work
with me appreciated the fact that I paid my consultants. Paying in goods, as I did at the beginning when I was not
yet sure how to handle the issue, in contrast, gave me an awkward, patronizing feeling.

The absential and past demonstratives are used when the referent is not seen or otherwise
perceived by the speaker at the moment of speaking. Their forms are given in Table 18.

Since they are used for referents which are out of reach and not seen or perceived, these
demonstratives are the only ones that can be negated:189(227)(228)kas

{EA, Abuelo 017}The absential demonstratives are used when the speaker is not looking at or perceiving the
referent at the moment of speaking. As my consultants often explained, the use of the
absential demonstrative implies that the speaker knows that the described situation holds, e.g.
that the referent is at the indicated place (cf. (229), (230)) or that it participates in the event
encoded by the verb (cf. (231), (232)).

{EA, DEM 089}A referent that cannot be seen, but otherwise perceived (cf. 4.9.2.4), can also be referred to by
an absential demonstrative. This indicates usually that the sound (or smell, sensation) is not
perceived anymore. Consider the following example:

toje -wa
DM.a.n

‘I heard it when I just walked by.’{EA, DEM 199}The same is the case when an object moving in the air is concerned. This kind of object is also
referred to by a distal form of Set 3 when the speaker is looking at it. In contrast, when the
object is already out of sight, the absential demonstrative is used, as in (236).

‘The red macaw is flying by.’ [we don’t see it anymore]{EA, DEM 068}When the situation is not continuing during the moment of speech or when the speaker does
not know if it is continuing or not, the past demonstrative is used. So, for example, the
consultant’s comment to (237) was that the object was definitely gone:

{EA, In between 088}Congruence in semantic and pragmatic categoriesAll referential elements with the same referent have to be congruent in the semantic and
pragmatic features they express. With respect to gender and number, this is straightforward,
since all types of referential elements make the same distinctions in these categories.
However, the pragmatic categories are not represented equally in the different types of
referential elements. The personal pronouns only differentiate between two categories,
presence and absence. The article, in addition to these categories, can furthermore encode
ceased existence of the referent. The demonstratives, finally, distinguish presence, absence
and ceased existence according to different criteria than both the article and the pronouns,
probably because they do not only refer to an entity, but also to the motion or position event
in which the entity is involved.
If the clause contains a demonstrative, the other referential elements agree with it. That is to
say, their selection follows the criteria for the use of the demonstratives. The following
examples may serve as an illustration:

{JA, Tuncho 025}In (240), the absential demonstrative is used because the speaker cannot see the anaconda,
even though it is not far away. The absential article is probably used in agreement with the
demonstrative. The speaker in (241) suggests what I might be telling people when I would be
back home; she did not imply that the old woman would be dead at that occasion. Thus, the
article, like the demonstrative, temporally locates the situation, not the existence of the person
referred to.
