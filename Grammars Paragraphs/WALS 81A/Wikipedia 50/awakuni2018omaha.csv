"What is the order of words in a
postpositional phrase in English?",[239]
"C. The instructor reads the Omaha
names aloud, noting their meanings.
The students repeat the names aloud
as a class. The instructor then goes
through the names randomly, asking• A series of verbs can sometimes be
chained together. When this occurs,
one verb is the head verb. The head verb
applies to the subject immediately. Other
verbs modify the head verb by describing
or limiting the domain of its action.
• In English the head verb comes first, and
any modifying verbs follow it in a chain.
In Omaha, the order is reversed. The
head verb comes last, and any modifying
verbs precede it in the reverse of the
order they would appear in an English
sentence.
• In English the modifying verbs in the
chain are usually introduced by the littleExpressions and Word Orderword “to,” as in “to walk,” “to hear,” and
so forth. In Omaha, there is no “to” word.
The basic verbs are simply placed one
after another.","[391, 392]"
"Demands and AblautHow to Construct an English SentenceHow to Construct an Omaha SentenceThe English method relies on permutations of
classes of concept words and is extremely complicated. The Omaha method is to use a special word for each type of demand and is quite
simple.
Note that in Omaha, verbs always come after
their nouns, whether these are subject or object.
This is entirely different than in English, where
object nouns normally come after their verb.
Thus in English [The cat (subject noun)] [caught
(transitive verb)] [the mouse (object noun)], but
in Omaha [The cat (subject noun)] [the mouse
(object noun)] [caught (transitive verb)].","[407, 408]"
"7. She may order him to speak
English.",[405]
"• The possessive prefix gi-­before a
transitive verb implies that the verb
affects an object that is the possession of
the subject. Thus the subject is acting on
his or her own thing or relative.",[574]
"7. She may order him to speak English:
Wāx̌ e īe tʰe ié āgazhi tte.",[595]
"8. Since I have become an old
man, I’m going to put my affairs in
order.
9. I don’t like that boy because
he’s boastful.",[579]
"299and these take a definite order. Only two
consonants can be in a cluster. A fricative
comes before a stop, n, or a ledh. A stop
comes before a ledh.",[370]
"8. Since I have become an old man, I’m
going to put my affairs in order: Iⁿshˀáge
ahí tʰe egóⁿ, agígthiwagazu tta miⁿkʰe.",[646]
"• A word that tells what someone is doing
is called a verb.
• In Omaha a verb can stand alone as a
complete sentence, without needing a
subject in front of it as in English. The
subject is implied. This is the Omaha
way of saying that he, she or it is doing
something.",[375]
"• Sentence: a directed series of words that
conveys a concept along with the demand
• Concept: the part of the sentence that tells
the listener what the speaker is talking
about; this includes most nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and other words and phrases
that reference things in the real world• Demand: the part of the sentence that
signals what the speaker wants the
listener to do with the concept; a demand
might be a command, a statement, or
a question, but a concept without a
demand is not a complete sentence. To
signal demand, English makes some
basic postulates about a sentence:
It has a subject, to which the rest of the
sentence relates as a predicate. The
subject is a noun phrase.
It has a head verb, which links the
predicate to the subject.",[407]
"• An object is someone or something
that is on the receiving end of the verb’s
action. If “Arabelle kicked the rock,” then
the rock is the direct object of Arabelle’s
kicking action. If “Madelyn sees the tree
frog,” then the tree frog is the object of
Madelyn’s action.
• Omaha object pronouns are affixed to
the front of the verb, just as the subject
pronouns are. For Omaha, we call the
direct object pronouns the patient
pronouns.",[425]

"How to Play
Students should already be familiar with basic
action verb commands in order to play Natural
Body Action/Total Physical Response. Separate
students into teams of two. Give one command
to the pair. The first to perform appropriate
action remains in game play. The other moves
to the back of their line. Go through the different body action phrases to continue game play.

"D. The instructor has each student
command some other student to do
something, using the verb āgazhi.
Example:Ttígax̣ e
The students count from 1 to no more than 10
in Omaha. (If there are more than 10 students
in the class, the class is subdivided into two or
more groups as necessary.) This will be the order
in which they take their turns. The instructor
then puts the class in ttígax̣ e mode, in which
no English may be spoken, by saying: Ttígax̣ e
oⁿgátha tta! Then the students take turns, in
order of their numbers, giving each other commands. The person commanded should do as
instructed. If, for any reason, someone cannot
execute or does not understand the command,
the student may demur by saying: Bthíˀa (“I can’t
do it”). At the end of the period, the instructor
takes the class out of ttígax̣ e mode by announcing: Ttígax̣ e shóⁿ ppāx̣ e! (“I put an end to
ttígax̣ e!”).

forward and write a word on the board,
using the verb bax̣ ú. Example:

"• The third person singular patient, like
the subject, takes no affixed pronoun.
The default meaning of a plain transitive
verb is: s/he [verb]s/ed him/her.
• The patient affixed pronouns include

“us”; just as the subject affixed pronounsVerb Conjugationinclude forms for “I,” “you,” and “we.”
In addition, we have a patient affixed
pronoun wa-­, which means animate
“them.” This type of “them” is used only
for people and animals. We do not use
an affixed pronoun when referring to
multiple inanimate objects.","[425, 426]"
"Verb Conjugation• The order of combination seems to follow
two rules: (1) If one affixed pronoun begins
with a vowel and the other does not, then
the one beginning with a vowel comes
first. (2) Otherwise, the patient pronoun
comes first, before the agent pronoun.
• The combinations “I do it to us” and “We
do it to me” do not make much sense
semantically, and there seems to be no
known way of saying these things.

C. The instructor goes around the class,
challenging each student with a base
verb. The student responds by giving505the possessive gi-­form, along with a
gesture of crossing arms with each hand
grasping the opposite upper arm, as if
hugging a relative. Example:

[makes gi-­gesture]D. The instructor goes around the class
again, challenging each student with
a base verb and one or two emphatic
pronouns. If there are two, the first
pronoun is the object pronoun, and the
second is the subject pronoun. A third
person subject will be é. A third person
plural animate object, “them,” will be é
ama. The student should respond with
the gi-­form of the word, appropriately
conjugated, along with the possessive
gi-­gesture. Again, “wí” and “thí” will be
reversed in the interaction.",[576]
"352 Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNL• We thus have about five person-­number
combinations in modern Omaha for the
subject: I; you-­singular; you-­plural; we;
and the third person (he, she, it, they).

and you-­plural holds only for -­e verbs.
For all other verbs, there is only I, you,
we, and third person.","[422, 423]"
"461Locative Prefixes and wa-­18. 1 The wa-­ PrefixDetransitivizing wa-­• In English, a transitive verb (vt) requires
the object to be stated explicitly, either
the noun it acts upon or a pronoun, like
“him,” “her,” “it,” or “them.” If no object is
mentioned, then the verb is intransitive.
Thus if “I ate pie,” the verb “ate” is
transitive, but if “I already ate,” the verb is
intransitive, because no object is stated.
Omaha works differently. In Omaha a
simple transitive verb implies a discrete
object, whether or not the object is
mentioned. If no object is mentioned, the
object is assumed to be “him,” “her,” “it,”
or “them.” Thus, “Kkóⁿde thatʰá” means
“He ate plums,” but if we simply say
“Thatʰa,́” it means “He ate it,” not “He ate.”
• To turn a transitive verb into an
intransitive verb in Omaha, we need to18
add the prefix wa-­in front of it (vg, verb
generalizer or detransitivized form of
the verb). To say “He ate” in Omaha,
we would say “Wathátʰa.” In this case,
wa-­may serve as a generic noun used to
reference an indefinite thing or things
that we don’t need to mention.","[532, 533, 534]"
"In order to learn the Umóⁿhoⁿ language, our ears
must “be tickled” time and time again for us to

common phrases repeatedly as well as having

require modeling for the appropriate physical
response. When the lesson is introduced, first
call upon another teacher or student to model
the desired action.

"Ttígax̣ e: Twenty Questions
A number of known objects are laid out around
the room. One student is “it,” and the rest close
their eyes. The one who is “it” wanders freely
around the room and chooses an item. The other
students take turns guessing what the item is, or
asking questions or giving commands to the one
who is “it,” to narrow down the range of possibilities. They can ask any question but what the
item is. Positionals should be used. When someone guesses correctly, that person is the next to
be “it.” Otherwise, if no one guesses correctly
within twenty tries, the person who is “it” must
tell what it is (using a positional), and the next
person in order becomes “it.” Example:366Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNLCari (“it”): Wôⁿgithe ishtá thipˀíⁿza i a!
(“Everyone close their eyes!”)[Everyone else closes their eyes. Cari picks
the red apple.]Cari: Edādoⁿ ebthégoⁿ tʰe uthá ígaskoⁿtha i
a! (“Try to tell what I’m thinking of!”)
Ron: Snēde a?","[436, 437]"
"• Detransitivized wa-­verbs are not
necessarily intransitive, however,
because they may be repurposed for a
different type of object. Thus sṇāthe is
a transitive verb that means to smear
something, such as wax. If we add
detransitivizing wa-­, we get wasṇāthe,
which means to smear generally,
whether wax, grease, paint, or whatever.
But if we want to wax the car, then we
use this same word, detransitivized with
respect to the substance smeared, yet
transitive with respect to the object the
substance is smeared upon.
• Further, verbs can be used as nouns
to discuss their action. In this case
a wa-­prefix verb will indicate the
general activity implied by the verb.
Thus, if thawá means “count (them)”,
then watháwa means the activity of
counting. If thix̣ ú means to draw or
paint something, then wathíx̣ u means
the activity of drawing or painting.
Similarly, wathízha could mean the
activity of washing or doing the laundry
as well as the verb meaning to wash a463464Lessons from Omaha Language Class at UNLvariety of things, and wathátʰe could
mean the activity of eating. In contrast,
if thatʰé were used as a noun, it would
refer to a single discrete action of eating
something.","[534, 535]"

Postpositional Phrase, Noun vs. Verb
In English we have prepositions—­words like in

Umóⁿhoⁿ Íye has a similar set of words, but they
come after nouns, so they are called postpositions. Consider the following phrase:
wéuzhi-­tʰedi: in the container
Wéuzhi “container” is the noun in this phrase.
As we have learned, -­tʰe is the article “the.” So
what is the -­di left on the end? What kind of
word is it, and what is its meaning? It is a postposition, and it means “in.”

"• Although the causative-­proper verb that
is being conjugated starts with a ledh,
/th/, it does not merge in front with the

some other initial sound, possibly an
initial /h/, that has since dropped away.
Thus, the causative conjugation is
perfectly regular.
• Omaha recognizes four possible
subjects, or agents: “I,” “you,” “we,”
and third person (he, she, it, and they).
It recognizes five possible objects, or
patients: “me,” “you,” “us,” animate
“them,” and third person (him, her, it,
and inanimate them). This means that
twenty combinations are theoretically
possible for a transitive verb. Some of
these do not usually make much sense,
such as “you do it to you,” “I do it to us,”
“I do it to me,” “we do it to me,” and “we

be used for a single subject that is not
present, and has not been seen for a
while, so that the speaker does not know
quite where that subject is. In a story,
amá suggests that the subject has been
out of sight of the narrator and listener,
who have been following their own
perspective on the story.
• The positional amá is felt by many
modern speakers to indicate that the
subject is plural. However, either amá
or akʰá can refer to a plural subject. If
we use akʰá, we mean a clearly defined,
manifest set, with all members known,
accounted for, and acting together asPronouns and Positionals367a unit. We call this concept collective
plurality. We use amá to indicate
distributive plurality, by which we mean
various individuals of no fixed number,
all going their own way.","[437, 438]"
"• The base word of the dative causative
should be an active verb. The meaning
is that one person allows or makes it
possible for another person do the verb,
so that they do it. So if the base word is to
“hear it,” then the dative causative means
that someone lets someone else hear it.",[496]

"• Omaha uses instrumental prefixes to turn
words indicating a condition into verbs of
action. In the preceding table, stative verbs
(adjectives) are turned into transitive verbs
by adding the instrumental prefix thi-­.
This is functionally comparable to what
the basic causative introduced in 16.6 does.",[504]

C. The instructor goes around the class,
challenging each student with a dativegī-­verb and an emphatic pronoun.
The student should respond with the
appropriate conjugation form. Note that
“wí” and “thí” will be reversed in the
interaction. Example:
Wagōⁿze: Gīkʰu. Oⁿgú. (“Invite him/
her. We.”)
Jessica: Oⁿgīkʰu. (“We invited him/
her.”)
Wagōⁿze: Gīshi. Thí. (“Ask to do
something. You.”)Rick: Ēshi. (“I asked him/her to do it.”)
Wagōⁿze: Uīkkoⁿ. Wí. (“Help him/her.
I.”)
John: Uthēkkoⁿ. (“You helped him/
her.”)D. The instructor goes around the class
again, challenging each student with a
dative í-­verb and one or two emphatic
pronouns. If there are two, the first
pronoun is the object pronoun, and the
second is the subject pronoun. A third
person subject will be é. A third person
plural animate object, “them,” will be é
ama. A verb that takes no personal object
will be presented with only one emphatic
pronoun. The student should respond
with the appropriate conjugated form.
Again, “wí” and “thí” will be reversed in
the interaction.
E. The students form groups of about
four to six, with a deck of cards, and play
this as a game using gī-­verbs, according
to the rules described in part E in 18.4
and 18.6.",[591]
"You can vary this (e.g., do it once slowly,
once fast).
Play a Sound Game using the Umóⁿhoⁿ Sound
Guide board and pointer.
Divide the students into two groups, the
Earth and Sky. They should stand in
two lines. Wagóⁿze points to a vowel on
the sound guide board. The student to
pronounce it correctly wins one point
for that side. This should be played until
oral observation shows the students
understand Umóⁿhoⁿ vowel sounds.
Walkie-­Talkie ExerciseDivide the students into two groups. Give each
group its list of sets ordered for reading into
the walkie-­talkie. The students separate. The
first (odd) group will read the words in their set
in Umóⁿhoⁿ only. The group hearing the word
will try to figure out which word it is and tell the
English meaning. If they guess right, the group
gets 1 point. If they guess wrong, the group read-Summering the word gets 1 point. Elders can help the
students practice pronouncing before they talk
into the mic. The sets are to be done in order (1,
2, 3, 4 . . .).

Method and OrderHave the teacher work with an assistant, Elder,
or other teacher to model this exchange—­in
both directions. Wait until another day before
advancing.
On the day that you plan to have students
participate for the first time (day 1), simplify
by dropping Ebé bthíⁿ-­tʰe uwíbtha-­tamiⁿkʰe

phrase from previous exposure).
Day 1: Model again with assistant, Elder,

students you believe will be able to
answer.
Day 2: Prompt the same students as
yesterday, then go round-­robin,
prompting each student.","[165, 166]"
"C. The instructor goes around the class,
challenging the students with a base
verb. The students respond by giving the
reflexive kki-­form, along with a gesture
of lightly slapping themselves on the
upper chest to indicate that the action is
done to or for themselves. Example:

two, the first pronoun is the object
pronoun, and the second is the subject

é. A third person plural animate object,
