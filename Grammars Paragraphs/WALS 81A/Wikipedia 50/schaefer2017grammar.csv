"Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 7gbé áwà [gbáwà]
kill dogdé óràn
buy wood[dóràn]Verbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representations diverge.
sén áwà [sánwà]
stab dogtón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vowels (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.
kóó ébè [kóébè]
read bookkó
émà [kémà]
plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.
sá óì [sáóì]
fetch itgbé óì [gbéóì]
kill itOrthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide formation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identification of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency relative to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.
àòó ‘thought’
èkpà ‘vomit’oo ‘to think’
kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.
òzètò
[ò-ze-étò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hairòdènyò
[ò-da-ényò]
‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.
ákèvà
[á-ken-èvá]
‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-twoókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]
‘upward’
prefix-be.next.to-topIn compounds, non-nasal vowels elide and are not rendered orthographically. In
noun-noun compounds, orthographic practice and broad phonetic rendering align,
except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.
ákòísí' [àkò
òísí']
‘holster’ sheath gunákùhàì [àkò
ùhàì]
‘quiver’ sheath arrowElision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms referring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.
ésèsé
[ésè-ésè]
‘direct center of’
ésè
‘center of’èdèdé
[édè-édè]
‘moments ago’
édè
‘day’Pronunciation of phrasal compounds also reflects glide formation. The final
close vowels of augmentative údù and diminutive úvbì, when preceding a vowel,
assume a glide shape. Orthographic practice retains the corresponding vowel.
údú émà [údwémà]
AUG yam
‘big yam’úvbì àfàn [úvbyàfàn]
DIM harp
‘small harp’Basic sentence types and pitch register | 91.5 Basic sentence types and pitch register
Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).
(1) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.
(2) è ólí émàè.
eat the food
‘Eat the food.’
Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.
(3) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè.
the man PRP.eat the food
‘The man has eaten the food.’
However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.
(4) ólí ómòhè é
ólí émàè?
the man PRP.eat the food
‘Has the man eaten the food?’
Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).
(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
the man SC C eat the food
‘The man is eating the food, is he?’10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by presence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full account of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be undertaken.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

Emai is a terraced-level tone language showing high, low, and down-stepped high.
For some word classes, inherent tone values distinguish words that in all other aspects of sound shape are identical. Nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs in
citation form express lexical meanings through tonal contrasts. Citation forms of
verbs, auxiliaries, and adverbial preverbs generally exhibit no tonal contrast, as
with other Edoid languages (Elugbe 1989). Emai verbs, auxiliaries, and preverbs are
assigned tone values reflecting grammatical properties of their constructions. In
large part these values correlate with the categories indicative and subjunctive
mood. More specifically, major patterns of tonal contrast derive from aspect (perfect, imperfect and prospective), modality (deontic and epistemic) and sentence
complement type.
For Emai words composed of identical segments, predominantly nouns and adverbs, tone values play a distinguishing role. Emai's high (H), down-stepped high
(!H) and low (L) tones combine in various ways within otherwise identical lexical
nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs. In orthographic practice, high tone isSyllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 5represented by an acute accent, low tone by a grave accent, and down-stepped high
by an acute accent immediately followed by a single quote. The last of these tones is
one pitch step lower than an immediately preceding high tone.

‘shadow’íkèké [ H L H ]
‘bicycle’1.4 Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography
Major word classes tend to reflect contrasting syllable structures, although no absolute relation exists between category type and syllable character. All parts of speech
are vowel final. Nouns are uniformly vowel-initial. Verbs tend to be consonant initial, with a few being vowel initial. Adjectives are usually consonant initial, whereas
adverbs are either vowel- or consonant initial. Of the minor categories, some are
predominantly consonant initial with a few vowel initial forms (preverbs, postverbal
particles, complements). Other minor categories are vowel initial (determiners) with
a few consonant initial forms (intensifiers). The preposition class is consonant initial. Concord expression is vowel only with fixed tone patterns.
In pronunciation, the syllabic character of word classes in phrasal or clausal
constructions is normally adjusted by one or another phonological process: vowel6 | Orthography and grammatical overviewelision or glide formation. These processes lead to a divergence between the orthographic practice of employing citation forms and normal-rate pronunciation rendered phonetically. Regardless of phonetic transformation through glide formation
or vowel elision, orthographic practice retains vowel segments in all word classes.
Glide formation affects the close vowels [i] and [u] when they precede non-close
vowels within a lexical or syntactic constituent. These vowels alternate with the
glides [y] and [w], respectively, as illustrated by the verbs fi and ku when followed
by a noun phrase.
fí
ópìà [fyópìà]
throw cutlasskú
àmè [kwàmè]
throw waterUnder specific grammatical conditions, the vowel elision process omits a morpheme-final vowel. Elision differentially affects word classes, revealing complex
interactions between phonological and syntactic parameters. Vowel elision application is restricted across major syntactic constituents like subject/predicate and predicate/adverb. In normal pronunciation of the sentence below, neither the final vowel of the subject noun ókpósó ‘woman’ nor the initial vowel of the verb éhén
‘prepare’ elide. Similarly, neither the final vowel of the direct object ákhé ‘pot’ nor
the initial vowel of the adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ elide. However, the final vowel of the
predeterminer ólì ‘the’ elides, as does the final vowel of the verb éhén.

Vowels juxtaposed due to discourse repositioning of constituents are not elided. The
final vowel of noun áwà ‘dog,’ when in clause-initial topic position, is not omitted
relative to the initial vowel of following élì ‘the.’

Vowel elision in pronunciation reflects three phonetic patterns that become
transparent most easily with transitive verb phrases. When a lexical direct object
immediately follows a consonant initial verb with a single vowel, the final vowel of
the verb is omitted, while the initial vowel of the direct object is retained. Orthographic representation shows both vowels nonetheless, as shown by comparing
orthographic representations to square bracketed broad phonetic representations.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"
"Cultural and Linguistic Background
Emai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilometers on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, OjavunNew-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the related Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for committing murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyaibi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-OldSite. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent OraPreface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list supporting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader classificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, BendorSamuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is extremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encompassing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished dissertation “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonology and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic grammatical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant language of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An extensive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papersx | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Egbokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home language in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.","[8, 9, 10]"

The interrogative form ékà frames lexical and phrasal questions of Cost. Lexical cost
questions relate to subject and direct object positions. ékà Cost questions occur
when the matrix clause shows a verb whose direct object is subcategorized for cost,
e.g. hae ‘pay.’ Direct questions of Cost with these verbs show ékà in question position, while indirect questions show ékà as head of a li/ni marked relative clause.

question of Cost formed with Equational Identity.","[415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422]"

Another complex clause construction found in narrative discourse expresses desiderative concessive. It is framed by bíì khi and disjunct dà ‘or.’ This construction construes one event as an ultimate wish or desire, given possible occurrence of a second event. It is translated ‘at least, provided that.’ The desiderative concessive
clause requires auxiliaries kha and rere, while the accompanying clause requires
complementizer complex dà bíì khi. Constructions of this type appear most natural
with second person subjects in both clauses.

Desiderative concessive clauses are strictly ordered. kha rere must precede dà bíì

clauses are often ellipted, leaving only the dà bíì khi clause.","[923, 924, 925]"

11Addition of Punctual ghe to matrix rather than subordinate clause leads to a different temporal
relation that reduces the temporal interval between matrix event and utterance reference time.

14One might interpret these ghe constructions (as well as that of some other temporal relations) as
simply juxtaposition of two clauses with no grammatical marking of subordination. Such an analysis, however, fails to recognize the dual functionality of preverbs like ghe, which have temporal
significance, and the seemingly parallel dual functionality of relative tense auxiliaries ke and kpe.
Each has a common sense that adjusts for matrix or subordinate clause status.

"14.3.2.1 Temporal coincidence ke / kpe and continuous aspect
A subordinate clause showing Continuous aspect and relative tense ke or kpe signals overlap of a temporal interval between distinct events. Coincidence at onset or
endpoint occurs with addition of aspectualizer ghe. Construction events are constrained as to linear order and subject coreference.
Subordinate clauses with Continuous aspect and Anterior ke link to matrix
clauses in Past perfect. The matrix clause rejects Present perfect and both imperfects. The construction codes a temporal overlap between events.

Concessive relations are marked as subordinate in multi-clause constructions. For
one construction class, a single epistemic auxiliary or a combination of epistemic
auxiliaries express concessiveness. Concessive relations occur as perfect, prospective and counter-to-fact types. A second, less robust class relies on a complex complementizer. Linked concessive clauses constrain aspect, modality, linear order, and
subject coreference.
Concessive constructions rely on the presumed truth of one proposition as the
basis for judging the truth value of another. The proposition to which truth is conceded is marked in Emai by epistemic modality form Concessive rere.8 Its matrix
clause is framed by various auxiliary forms. Concessives are identifiable in three
construction types: perfect, prospective and counterfactual, as illustrated below.

the sense ‘even, supposedly.’

Perfect concessive constructions express the unexpectedness of one event while
conceding the truth of another. The concession, framed as a subordinate clause
marked by rere, is linked to a matrix clause. Perfect concessives restrict occurrence
of aspect, relative tense, linear order of their clauses, and subject coreference across
matrix and subordinate clause. They have no corresponding direct question.

Counter-to-fact concessive constructions concede that occurrence of one event,
which failed to transpire, would not have impacted occurrence of a second. Truth
about one event's nonoccurrence fails to impact truth of another. The concession,
framed as subordinate by Hypothetical kha and rere in that order, links to a matrix

A purposive relation between events is signaled by relational nominal ògùì ‘activity
of’ (Chapter 4, 4.2). It occurs in noun phrases subcategorized for place, either by a
verb or by preposition vbi. Phrases with ògùì follow verbs of motion, although not all
directional motion verbs accept ògùì phrases. In particular, motion verbs that entail
a relation of achievement or arrival (e.g. o ‘enter’) relative to place reject ògùì.

Circumstantial extent clauses show ébé'/ébí'...i and verb se ‘reach, be sufficient’ in
series. Subordinate extent specifies information assumed to be true and causally
related to a result articulated in the matrix clause. Each element of the extent frame
is necessary for circumstantial extent. Neither ébé'/ébí' and Manner i, ébé'/ébí' and
se, nor i and se is sufficient to render an extent interpretation.20

Circumstantial ébé'/ébí'…i…se constructions restrict aspect, relative tense and

Counterfactual condition constructions establish an event that is contrary to fact as
a condition for realizing a second event that has failed to transpire. Emai shows two
types of contrary-to-fact conditions: possible and impossible. The possible type
presents a counterfactual condition potentially reversible in the real world. The
impossible does not entertain reversibility. Subordinate clauses of both types are
framed by kha. Their linked matrix clauses show kha for possible conditions and
Predictive ló for impossible conditions.

Countrary-to-fact possible condition constructions restrict aspect, relative tense,

coreference. Subordinate and matrix clauses in possible condition counterfactuals
require aspect agreement. Both clauses inflect for Past perfect (right edge high tone
subject). They reject Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, possible condition counterfactuals do not accept relative tense Anterior ke or Subsequent kpe, either in subordinate and matrix clause, or in subordinate clause alone.

"3.2.8 Preverb order and emphatic constructions
Additional support for order relations among preverb classes is discernable in emphatic constructions, which characterize narrative discourse. Aspectualizer gbo and
manner-demonstrative ìyó frame an order schema. Preverb distribution in these
constructions reflects a scale. One end has the more event-directed classes aspectualizer (ASP), evaluative (EVAL) and temporal (TEMP); the other end has the participant-directed quantity (Q) class. Between are subject attributive (SA) and mannerdemonstrative (MD). Using this scale, preverbs more event-directed, e.g. aspectualizers, precede those more participant-directed, e.g. quantity.
ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q3.2.8.1 Preverb repetition
Two Emai preverbs frame one emphatic type. In nonemphatic constructions, either
Additive gbo ‘also/too’ or distal manner-demonstrative ìyó ‘that way’ precede an
otherwise unmodified verb, or a subject attributive or quantity class preverb. In
emphatic frames, gbo or ìyó precedes not only the preverb but also the verb. Emphatic iteration never extends to the more event-directed preverb classes aspectualizer and evaluative. In complex emphatic structures, gbo tends to precede the verb
and each preverb in the preverbal sequence, or it precedes only selected preverbs.",[186]
"3.2 Preverb categories
Preverb exponents follow auxiliaries in positions preceding the initial verb of a
clause. Unlike auxiliaries, preverbs tend to appear in imperative constructions. They
reflect six closed classes: aspectualizer (ASP), evaluative (EVA), temporal (TEM),
manner-demonstrative (MD) subject attributive (SA), and quantity (Q). Each exhibits
between two and eight forms.
Evaluative (EVAL)
duu ‘for no reason, in fact’
woo ‘instead’
kuku ‘after all’
Quantity (Q)
dobo ‘by PRO self’
gba ‘together’
zemi ‘very / very much’
zeze ‘a bit, not quite’
Subject Attributive (SA)

miti ‘be able’

totóbo ‘intensely’
kakégbe ‘by persevering’ya ‘almost started’ / ‘used to’
mo ‘almost done’ / ‘at one time’
a ‘whenever’Preverb classes are ordered relative to one another and their verb. Order relations become evident in multi-preverb phrases as well as preverb iteration or emphatic repetition constructions, where selected preverbs occur with emphatic effect
in narrative discourse. Preverb order reflects a scale, at one end of which are the
more event-directed classes, aspectualizer (ASP), evaluative (EVAL) and temporal
(TEMP), compared to the more participant-directed quantity (Q) class. In between
occur subject attributives (SA) and manner-demonstrative (MD).
ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q3.2.1 Aspectualizer preverbs
Aspectualizer preverbs classify events according to event-internal phases, profiling
the internal time frame of an event as to subphase or terminal boundaries onset or
endpoint. There are seven aspectualizer forms, four phasal and three boundary.
Phasal forms and their functions construe an event as uniform or intermittent over
an expanse of time. They include Repetitive che, Additive gbo, Durative se, and
Punctual ghe. Boundary forms bring into perspective the temporal onset or endpoint
of an event under realis or irrealis conditions. They include Conative òó, Ingressive
ya and Egressive mo. The latter two also manifest Past Absolute functions that bring
into perspective an event as one phase of a distal past interval of time. Aspectualizer
subclasses differentially constrain aspect, polarity, mood, and other preverbs.
Order relations exist within and across aspectualizer subclasses. Among phasal
forms, Durative precedes but never follows Repetitive, Additive or Punctual: DUR
REP/ADD/PCT. Boundary aspectualizers, with one exception, are mututally exclusive. Conative precedes Ingressive, but it is incompatible with Egressive and Past
Absolute functions: CON IG. Across subclasses, Ingressive and Past Absolute ya
precede phasal preverbs, whereas Conative and Egressive follow phasal forms. Past
Absolute mo does not combine with any phasal preverb.","[142, 143]"

Direct and indirect information questions consist of two constituents: question (or
focus) position and a matrix clause. Interrogative pronouns in question position
correspond to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause.
Matrix clauses across direct and indirect questions limit aspect. They inflect for
Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective, each of which exhibits a
right edge high tone subject phrase. Question constructions reject Present perfect,
Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective, each of which manifests a right
edge low tone subject.

the unacceptability of epistemic Certaintive ma (*émí ósò máà ù ólí ómòhè [thing

evaluative preverb kuku (*émí ósò kúkù ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRP.POEV happen.to the man] ‘Something after all happened to the man’).
Transitive ‘happen’ constructions confine the shape of their initial noun phrase.
They require noun émì ‘thing’ modified by existential quantifier ósò. No other postdeterminer is acceptable, i.e. demonstrative, numeral or kindred. As well, transitive
‘happen’ rejects noun émì when modified by an associative phrase, attributive
phrase or relative clause.
(120) émí ósò
í ì
ù
ólí ómòhè.

Morever, three additional negative properties characterize transitive u’s initial noun
phrase. This position does not accept nominative pronouns. Neither first person
singular/plural (í/má) nor third person (ó, íyàìn) is acceptable. It is therefore primarily word order that identifies subject position in transitive ‘happen’ constructions.

In addition, the initial nominal position with transitive u does not admit any impersonal pronouns. One does not find, for instance, demonstrative óáìn or kindred élìyó
(*óáìn / élìyó í ì ù ólí ómòhè [that.one that.kind SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘That one

As for the nominal position following transitive u ‘happen,’ it is not as restricted
as initial position. It permits a range of NPs and requires their syntactic elaboration.
Post-u noun phrase position accepts accusative pronouns across person and number categories, and it permits human proper nouns.

As direct object, post-u position allows human (óvbèkhàn) and nonhuman animate

disallows inanimate nouns (ópìà). Bare common noun direct objects, regardless of

e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá as well as kindred forms, deictic élìyó and
contrastive ódàn.
Transitive u direct object position allows most impersonal pronouns: demonstratives ònà, óáìn and ónóì, universal quantifiers, collective èrèmé and distributive

object position are numerals such as cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá and kindred
forms, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.

Constructions framed by si receive a purposive interpretation when their matrix
clause expresses deontic modality, e.g. Hortative í, or the subordinate clause conveys prospective aspect, e.g. Anticipative ló. Purposive si constructions reflect additional constraints regarding aspect, relative tense, linear order of clauses and cross
clause subject coreference.
Purposive si constructions restrict aspect and relative tense. Subordinate si
clauses inflect for Present perfect or Anticipative aspect. They disallow Past perfect,
imperfect Continuous or Habitual, and prospective Predictive.

Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sentence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construction also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct constructions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.

Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this construction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its following matrix clause conveys shared information.
Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For example, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.
(2) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ló

‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló
shèn ákhò.
the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phonological shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constituent (ólí ómóhé).
(3) ólí émà ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.

Focus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause position corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs.
Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix subject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus position noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374]"
"14.1 Conditional relations
Relations of logical or temporal condition (henceforth “conditional relations”) are
marked as subordinate in multi-clause constructions. They show an auxiliary in one
class of constructions and a complementizer in another. Among conditional relations are several semantic types. Linked subordinate and matrix clauses constrain
aspect and modality, their linear order, and subject coreference.
Hypothetical form kha participates in four conditional types: perfect, imperfect,
prospective, and counter-to-fact, respectively illustrated below.
(1) a. ólí ómòhè khà
káàwó óvbí óì, ò gbé

ó
vbì ìwè.
the man PAP.HYP see Ohi he PAP.HYP enter LOC house
‘If the man had seen Ohi, he would have entered the house.’
Independent of these constructions, kha serves as an epistemic auxiliary. In that
function it assumes the existence of an unspecified hypothetical condition that
controls event realization and asserts that had this condition been fulfilled, an event
would have occurred. Epistemic kha shows low tone and appears with a marked
melody subject phrase (right edge high tone).

‘The man would have killed the rat.’876 | Multi-clause constructionsb. élí ímóhé khà
yá é ófè.
the men PAP.HYP IG eat rats
‘The men would have started eating rats (were it required).’
A second marker of conditional subordination is complementizer si. It occurs in
circumstantial and purposive condition constructions.

he HOR try p ot
inspect COND soup PRP.remain arrive
‘He should examine the pot to determine if soup remained.’
In other constructions, si marks an embedded S-complement. It contrasts with indicative khi and subjunctive li. It specifies speaker judgment that the grammatical
subject is committed only conditionally to the truth value of information in the embedded clause.
(4) ólì òkpòsò ò ó mìàá sí
ólí óvbèkhàn é

clauses are framed by kha and an intention bearing verb.1
(5) ò khà
káàwó óvbí óì, ò gbé
évìè á.
he PRP.HYP look.at child his he PRP.break tears CS
‘When he looked at his child, he burst into tears.’
Clauses in perfect condition constructions constrain aspect, relative tense, linear order of subordinate and matrix clauses as well as subject coreference. Their
subordinate clauses limit aspect and relative tense. They inflect for Present perfect
(right edge low tone subject phrase and left edge high tone verb phrase) and show
low tone kha. Subordinate kha clauses reject Past perfect, imperfect and prospective
aspect.","[901, 902]"
"458 | Be, do, happen and havePAR subject position partially restricts impersonal pronouns.16 It allows pronouns for deictic demonstrative ònà and óáìn (ònà / óáìn ríì vbì ò [this.one that.one
PRP.be LOC them] ‘This / that one is among them’), cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá (èvá

èvèvá).
Noun phrase positions in PAR constructions respond asymmetrically to repositioning in discourse. ri and e constructions behave dissimilarly as well. With ri, PAR
subject corresponds to a constituent designated as positive focus li/ni, negative
focus ki, or topic. PAR subject fails to correspond to an interrogative pronoun. In e
constructions, PAR subject never corresponds to a constituent in focus, topic or
question word position. Similarly restricted are vbi complements, which fail to correspond to any discourse position: focus, topic or question word.

Verb phrase properties pertain to polarity and mood, verb suffixes, inflection, auxiliary categories, preverb categories and postverbal particles.
Noun phrase properties include NP type, animacy, syntactic shape and correspondence to discourse defined positions. This same u form, in collocation with particular
nouns, also expresses a range of meanings translated as ‘act, behave, execute,
achieve, perform’ (Chapter 8, 8.4).","[483, 484, 485]"

An event of circumstance is marked as subordinate by complementizers in construction with a preverb or a preverb plus verb in series. Relations of circumstance affect
temporal and causal dimensions. Clauses conveying relations of causal circumstance and circumstantial extent each employ complementizer ébé'/ébí' or
élàbé/élàbí and Manner preverb i/e. It is verb se ‘reach’ in series that distinguishes
circumstantial extent from causal circumstance.

Complementizer ébé'/ébí' and preverb i/e framing circumstantial constructions are
also utilized in information questions. Questions of manner employ these two constituents (Chapter 7, 7.5.2.2), while questions of extent utilize ébé'/ébí', preverb i/e
and verb se in series (Chapter 7, 7.5.2.3).

Causal circumstance constructions specify one event as causal information assumed
to be true about circumstances that led to a second event. The assumed causal information occupies a subordinate clause with ébé'/ébí' and Manner preverb i. The
result event is conveyed by a matrix clause.

as he PAP.MAN drink wine he H do senseless
‘As / Since he drank wine, he was senseless.’
Causal circumstance constructions constrain aspect, relative tense and order of
constituent clauses, but they do not limit subject coreference. Subordinate causal
circumstance clauses restrict aspect and relative tense. They inflect for Past perfect
and imperfect Habitual. They reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous and prospective aspect.

Information in causal circumstance constructions corresponds to distinct constituents in émé'/émí'…ze ‘why’ questions. émé'/émí'…ze corresponds to subordinate
clause information, while an indicative khi complement expresses matrix clause
proposition. Responses derive from the erstwhile subordinate clause. Acceptable
responses show a subordinate clause with ébé'/ébí' and Manner i/e.

Constructions of causal circumstance are also framed by élàbé/élàbí in construction
with Manner preverb i/e. Phonological and tonal similarity suggest that élàbé/élàbí
is a likely historical precursor to ébé'/ébí'.
(190) élàbé òhí ó ò í

simile constructions.
(191) óvbékhán élàbí mè í khà

‘A youth like me (of same status) will not treat me that way.’

The grammatical properties of élàbé/élàbí causal circumstance mirror those of

Circumstantial clauses framed by ébé'/ébí'...i/e and Punctual aspectualizer ghe

A relation of temporal coincidence or overlap between events and their terminal
points is indicated by three distinct construction types. They involve either Continuous aspect in construction with ke, kpe or ghe, or clause initial complementizer bi in
construction with Concessive re. For each, coincidence is defined by either onset of
matrix and end point of subordinate or some other interval when matrix and subordinate event overlap.","[930, 931, 932]"

A condition of temporal anticipation or expectation is marked as subordinate by
nominal ètíní as relative clause head followed by a relative clause with verb re ‘take’

be syntactically omitted.

Anticipative ètíní constructions severely constrain aspect, relative tense, order
of constituent clauses and cross clause subject coreference. There is no direct question corresponding to Anticipative ètíní constructions.

A relation of temporal extent for one event relative to another occurs in frames involving the verb se ‘move as far as, reach’ or de ‘reach.’ Each requires an accompanying matrix clause with a temporally unbounded verb.","[940, 941, 942, 943]"

Relative clauses co-occur with demonstrative modifiers, although distinct order

Emai postdeterminer types display order relations relative to one another and to a
head noun (N). Six categories are evident: genitive (GEN), adjectival (ADJ), kindred
(KIND), number (NUM), relative clause (RC) and demonstrative (DEM). Relative to
one another, they most often exhibit behavior consistent with Schema A:
NGEN ADJ KIND NUM RC DEMA single NP headed by noun íkpùn ‘cloths’ illustrates this schema.

èvá lí ónwímé shén-í'
áìn
cloths ASS Oje R dark that.kind two R farmer PAP.sell-F those
‘those two dark cloths of Oje's of that kind that the farmer sold’
Less extended nominal phrases further support relations within Schema A. Regarding modifier types most often identified in the literature (Greenberg’s 1966, Universal #20), the corresponding Emai categories show ADJ NUM DEM. Adjective, marked
by relator particle li, precedes cardinal numeral èvá ‘two’ and demonstrative áìn
‘that.’ Reversing the order is unacceptable.
éwé lí óbín' èvá áìn

marked by associative preposition ísì.
éwé ísì òí lí óbín'
goats ASS his R dark
‘his dark goats’
Number, e.g. èvá ‘two,’ precedes relative clause (lí ónwímé shén'-ì), which is marked
by relator particle li.
éwé èvá lí ónwímé shén'-ì
goats two R farmer PAP.sell-F

Deictic demonstrative (e.g. áìn), in contrast, follows li and relative clause.
éwé lí ónwímé shén-í'
áìn
goats R farmer PAP.sell-F those
‘those goats the farmer sold’
The remaining postnominal category, kindred (e.g. élìyó ‘that kind’), is positioned
between adjective and number. It follows li-coded adjective, but it precedes number.

éwé ísì ójé élìyó
lí ónwímé dé-ló'-ì
goats ASS Oje that.kind R farmer PAP.buy-DS-F

With regard to Schema A’s broader character, relative clause and deictic demonstrative assume their respective positions on the right. The slot preceding relative clause
and following the head noun can be occupied by genitive, adjective, kindred or
number exponents. Reversing the order, e.g. deictic demonstrative preceding genitive or any of the others, is unacceptable.30232 | Noun modifierséwé ísì òí lí ónwímé shén-í'

precedes it in a complex classifying nominal phrase (úgógó úvbí ákhè [remains.of DIM pot] ‘broken
remains of a small pot’ but not *úvbí úgógó ákhè [DIM remnant.of pot]). The úgógó úvbí combination
never accepts a following expletive pronoun (*úgógó úvbí óì [remains.of DIM it] ‘broken remains of
it’) but it follows definite article ólí (ólí úgógó úvbí ákhè [the remains.of DIM pot] ‘the broken remains
of a small pot’). No other classifier combines with úvbì in this way.

khuun ‘to bundle’ (ólì òkpòsò khúún élí éràn [the woman PRP.bundle the wood] ‘The woman bundled
the wood’).
6A possible lexical source for ésèmì is the inherently plural noun èsèsèmì ‘condition of being in
pieces’ (ó dé ésèsèmì [it PRP.reach fragments] ‘It fragmented / is in a fragmented state / is wornEndnotes | 233out’), which in turn may be a gerundive form derived from the verb se ‘split’ (òjè sé òsé lágáá ímè
[Oje PRP.split path move.around farm] ‘Oje split a path around his farm’).
7There is no lexical source for úgógò, but oral narratives identify a mythic location úgò ‘Ugo.’8There is also a temporal predeterminer exclusively for temporal nouns (Chapter 6, 6.1.1).","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259]"
"422 | Noncanonical constructions25Identity í in partitive constructions manifests an obligatory high tone. It never co-occurs with a
preceding noun phrase as lexical subject (*ólì òkpòsò í yì ólí áwà? [the woman ID identify the dog]
‘Did the woman identify the dog?’).
26Interrogatives with verb yi never occur without Identity pronoun í (*yì ólí ényò [identify the wine]
‘Identify the wine’). In declaratives, the verb yi ‘identify, declare’ occurs with a cognate object (ólì
òjè yí íyì [the chief PRP.declare decree] ‘The chief set forth / made a decree’).
27yi complements disallow existential quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*í yì ómóhé ósò / óvbèé? [ID identify man certain another] ‘Which one is some / another man?’) and kindred forms élìyó and ódàn (*í yì
úkpún élìyó / ódàn? [ID identify cloth that.kind different.kind] ‘Which one is that kind of / a different
kind of cloth?’). Since these forms identify class rather than membership within a class, they cannot
denote definiteness of a member.
28Lexically headed relative clauses as yi complements do not require the definite article (í yì ómóhé
lí ólí ókpósó róó' émà ní? [ID identify man R the woman PAP.pick.out yam APP] ‘Which one is the
man that the woman gave yam to?’).
29Complements of yi never accept ékà indirect question frames of Cost (*í yì éká lí ólí ómóhé háé'-ì?

30SA subjects also allow human noun óìà ‘human being, person,’ but only when marked as known
by, for example, the definite article (érí' ólí óìà / *óìà ó vbì ìwè [SA the person person PRP.enter LOC
house] ‘Indeed, the person entered the house’).
31SA constructions incorporate generic Habitual statements with bare noun subjects (érí' ívbékhán ó
ò tò vbí émà [SA youths SC H fond.of LOC yam] ‘Indeed, youths are fond of yam’).
32SN ki construction subjects disallow nominal óìà ‘human being, person,’ even when modified by
the definite article (*kí ólí óíá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the person PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case the person entered the house’).
33Even when head of a partitive vbi phrase, cardinal numerals are unacceptable (*kí èvá vbí ó ó' vbì
ìwè ò [SN two LOC it two PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that two of them entered
the house’).
34As a final note, SN ki precedes matrix clauses linked to a subordinate clause so long as the matrix
clause maintains sentence initial position (kí ólí ómóhé shén' úkpùn lí ó kpè míé éghó' rè dè émà? [SN

"18As well, human nouns that express generic reference such as óìà/éèà ‘human being, person’ fail to
take a li complement: *óíá lì kéré [person R younger] ‘younger human being,’ *ééá lì kéré [persons R

19Additional human propensity adjectives are: ómóhé lì bùmèbúmé [man R haggard.and.worn out]
‘haggard man,’ óvbékhán lì tùzètúzé [youth R underweight.and.dirty] ‘an unkempt youth,’ and
ómóhé lì sènèséné [man R repulsive / very.ugly] ‘an ugly man.’
Not all human propensity adjectives appear as attributive phrases; the form húré ‘pompous’ requires
a relative clause.

22Never serving as li complement is the abstract noun àtà ‘truth’: *émí lì àtà [thing R true] ‘true

Age attributives fail with common noun heads that are human. Instead, analytic compounds
consisting of a human noun followed by an age noun refer to adult (not nonadult) standing in society rather than age relative to the immediate moment.*ómóhé lí ódíòn

condition, meaning of the phrase and tone on the head noun (spread of high tone) are identical:
ímóhé (lì) ògbèré [men R plentiful] ‘a lot of men,’ ékén (lì) ògbèré [sand R plentiful] ‘a lot of sand.’
25Collective and distributive numeral complements follow third person plural pronouns: íyáín lì èvá
[they R two] ‘both of them / group of two,’ and ìyàìn èvá [they two] ‘two of them.’26As a final comment, instances where phrases with collective and attribution interpretations might
be expected to co-occur, each marked by Relator li with a place or human noun in head position, fail
to do so: *íwé lì èvá lì kéré [house R two R small.size] ‘group of two small-sized houses’; *íwé lì kéré lì
èvá [house R small.size R two] ‘group of two small-sized houses’;*ímóhé lì èélè lì kéré [men R four R

28Pronominally headed relative clauses also occur in Emai. They fail to show Relator li, and they are
headed by a relative pronoun denoting either an animate (ólí), inanimate (émé') or place (ébé')236 | Noun modifiersreferent (Chapter 5, 5.8). Relative pronouns uniformly show high tone or high tone followed by high

30As a further note, ambiguity as to phrase head can occur in constructions with genitive phrase
and relative clause. In (i) relative clause head preceding Relator li could be possessum úríáí or possessor óvbéé; either could serve as direct object of shen ‘sell’ and thus as head of the relative clause.

Emai pronouns express relations relative to linguistic or situational context. They
reflect five basic types: personal, bound (anaphoric), interrogative, locative and
impersonal. Exponents of these types can reflect case, person, number, gender,
and/or definiteness. In characterizing Emai grammatical structure, both overt pronoun and zero (gapped) pronoun prove useful.
Zero pronoun is illustrated by the syntactic position following the transitive
verb nwu ‘take.’ This verb is subcategorized for a direct object. nwu takes a pronoun
(e.g. óì ‘it’) in the absence of a lexical noun. In series with another verb (e.g. hian
‘cut’), as well as in other structural patterns, nwu also takes a zero pronoun.
(1) a. ólí ókpósó ló
nwú óì ní émè.
the woman PRED take it APP me
‘The woman will give it to me.’
b. ólí ókpósó ló
hìàn éànmì nwú ní émè.
the woman PRED cut meat take APP me
‘The woman will cut meat in order to give it to me.’5.1 Definite personal pronouns
Definite personal pronouns reflect person (first, second or third), number (singular
and plural), case (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and discourse status
(emphatic).

ìyáínA single sentence reveals the position of various pronouns. Tone on subject
pronouns varies according to aspect, mood, or polarity features of the clause (Chapter 3, 3.1.1). Tone can also vary on other pronouns as grammatical features interact
throughout a clause.

óì ní émé vbí íwé

they PF they PAP.take it APP me LOC house ASS your

Restrained by case, number and person, personal pronouns refer to participants in
the situational or linguistic context. Third person subject forms (ó ‘she’) can co-refer
to a noun phrase in a preceding sentence.
(3) ólì òkpòsò míé
òhí. ó ó
vbì ìwè.
the woman PRP.see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
‘The woman1 saw Ohi. She1 entered the house.’
In complex sentences containing two or more clauses, nominative pronouns (ó)
express co-reference to a lexical antecedent (áléké) in a preceding clause. They tend
not to co-refer to a noun phrase in a following clause. This condition obtains regardless of whether the pronoun occurs in the main or subordinate clause of a complex
sentence.

míé òhí.
she PAP.enter LOC house as Aleke PAP.CONC see Ohi
‘Shei entered the house, when Alekei saw Ohi.’
For third person plural subject, e and yan exponents occur in complementary
distribution. Plural e tends not to co-refer to a noun phrase across a sentence
boundary; instead, it co-refers within a clause. In contrast, plural yan co-refers to a
noun phrase within or across sentences.
(5) a. élí ívbèkhàn yé

the youths
PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’
In addition, distribution of third person plural subject forms yan and e is controlled
by matrix clause aspect and structural position. Plural e is restricted to perfect aspect. It never occurs in clauses inflected for imperfect, as yan does. Plural third person e is limited to subject position relative to an antecedent in the same clause or
sentence; yan is not. When a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus,
antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix
clause inflects for perfect aspect, e or yan appears as subject.

imperfect aspect, yan occupies subject position. e never does, as topic and focus
li/ni constructions suggest.

‘As for youths, they kill rats.’
b. ívbèkhàn lí yán à / *é è gbè ófè.

When the third person plural emphatic pronoun appears in focus or topic position
linked to a matrix clause inflected for perfect aspect, subject position accepts only
yan, not e.

Within S-complements (marked by Indicative khi for example, Chapter 13, 13.2.1),
subject position under perfect aspect accepts yan or e, with yan showing ambiguity
between personal (disjoint reference vis-à-vis subject élí ímóhé) and logophoric
(conjoint reference vis-à-vis élí ímóhé) interpretations. In contrast, e offers only a
disjoint interpretation.

Of the personal pronouns, only emphatic forms appear with postdeterminer
modifiers. Emphatic pronouns for each person occur with emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone.’ No emphatic pronoun, however, co-occurs with the definite predeterminer
(*élì ìyàìn ‘the they’).

person plural allow postdeterminers from quantity, demonstrative and attributive
classes. The third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts the greatest range of
modifiers. It is found with cardinal or collective numeral modifiers but not distributive or ordinal numeral modifiers.

édàn [they different.kind] ‘they of a different kind’).
Relative to postnominal modifier types designated by a grammatical morpheme,
the third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts Relator li attributive phrases but
not relative clauses (*íyáín lí ójé shén' lí ókpósó [they R Oje PAP.sell APP woman]
‘they that Oje sold to the woman’) or Associative ísì phrases (*íyáín ísì òjè [they ASS

Emai subject position shows both an expletive and an indefinite pronoun. Expletive
o occurs in relation to an extraposed complement clause. Although an embedded Scomplement can serve as logical subject, it is obligatorily extraposed to clause final
position. Its grammatical subject position is held by expletive pronoun o.
(10) a. ò hùnmé

it PRP.be.fortuitous IND Oje PRP.kill the snake
‘It is fortuitous that Oje killed the snake.’
b. *khì òjè gbé
ólí ényè húnmé.
IND Oje PRP.kill the snake PRP.be.fortuitous
‘That Oje killed the snake is fortuitous.’
Subject position also shows indefinite pronoun a ‘one.’ If not translated by the
English passive, it is rendered with indefinite plural ‘they’ or ‘one’ in active voice.

Indefinite a is limited to subject positions subcategorized for human noun agentives
or experiencers, as grammatical gbe above illustrates. It is not licensed by stative
verbs (ri, da) or motion verbs (o, ye), which otherwise allow a human noun subject.

èhèèn) bears a direct object relation (*úèmí ísì èhèèn zé mé èmìànmì [eating ASS fish
cause me illness] ‘The eating of fish made me ill’). When gerundive forms follow
Associative ísì, the phrase shows a purposive ‘for’ interpretation.
(39) ò gbá-ló
émí ísì úgbèmí.
he PRP.tie-DS thing ASS dancing
‘He put on his costume for the purpose of dancing.’
Noun phrase arguments of transitive gerundives do not accept nominal modifiers. For instance, gerundive constructions take neither definite predeterminer ólí
(*ólí émá úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì [the yam eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘The yam eating made me ill’) nor kindred postdeterminer élìyó (*émá élìyó úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì
[yam that.kind eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘Eating yam of that kind made me ill’).
Complement position preceding a gerundive form is limited to direct object arguments. Even when framed by Locative vbi or Associative ísì, gerundive complement position rejects a locative adjunct: íwé or vbì ìwè in (*íwé úgbèmí / úgbèmí vbì
ìwè zé ókpósó ghònghòn [house dancing / dancing LOC house PRP.allow woman
be.happy] ‘Dancing in the house made the woman happy’) or subjects, òjè or ísì òjè

PRP.allow village be.happy] ‘The chief's drinking made the village happy’).
Gerundive phrases are not restricted to core grammatical relations subject and
direct object. They appear as objects of locative preposition vbi.

exhibit an optional split structure for a limited number of verbs. Intransitive verb
mianme ‘be difficult’ accepts an argument gerundive noun phrase as grammatical
subject. It also shows a split gerundive in which the argument precedes mianme and
the gerundive follows in direct object position. The argument requires obligatory
modification (definite predeterminer ólí). Reversing constituent order is unacceptable; the gerundive never precedes mianme and its argument never follows (*úhìànmí

Nominalization forms morphologically complex lexemes. It adjoins a single prefix to
multiple verb roots that otherwise occur as serial verb sequences or to verb stems
that incorporate a suffix. These lexemes reflect four semantic classes: conditions,
entities, instruments and places.","[75, 76, 77]"

That possessum possessor order derives from event condition, not simply verb condition, is revealed by constrasting construal of an inalienable possession relation.
As a simple predicate, hian ‘cut’ normally construes not only a body-part possessum
as attached to possessor but also a possessor as affected. Under these normal conditions possessor precedes possessum.

The verb hian and a body part direct object also occur as one element of a complex
predicate that incorporates Change of State particle a, which confirms a telic end
state. As a consequence, there is no further cutting of the body part. Since this end
state assumes the existence of a disjoint relation between possessor and possessum,
possessum precedes possessor with ísì interposed.

Specification of a point of temporal overlap between events is introduced by Punctual aspectualizer ghe (Chapter 3, 3.2.1.1). In one construction type, ghe and Continuous aspect combine in a subordinate clause.14 Construction reference is to overlap
of subordinate event onset and matrix onset. In these constructions, matrix clause
inflection is Past perfect, not Present perfect or either imperfect. A subordinate
clause that fails to show Continuous but retains aspectualizer ghe, inflecting for
Present perfect for instance, does not express temporal overlap.

A still more complex pattern of emphatic iteration occurs in constructions featuring

position. Again, temporal and evaluative do not factor in nonemphatic complex
multi-preverb constructions.
Evaluative and temporal aside, complex emphatic frames show one or more

consists of an object manipulation verb such as nwu ‘take hold,’ fi ‘throw,’ ku ‘cast’
or ze ‘scoop.’ Direct object referents of each verb are brought into contact and intermingle to form a composite. Predication sense is ‘add to, mix up with.’ Locative

Complex predicates specify a temporal rate relation with fuen re and its obligatory
complement égbè ‘body’ in series as V1.4 No other verb noun collocation exhibits
similar behavior. V2 consists of nonstative transitive or intransitive verbs. Predication sense is ‘slowly, gradually.’

The noun phrase position between fuen and re is restricted. It is confined to the
body-part noun égbè; no other body-part term is acceptable. In addition, NP2 égbè
allows no syntactic elaboration by pre- or post-determiners and no substitution by
an accusative pronoun (e.g. óì).5

V1 fuen re appears with NP1 as subject and NP2 égbè as direct object but only in imperfect Habitual. fuen égbè re fails in perfect aspect. As a simple verb, fuen does not
occur synchronically without re, regardless of aspect.

"3 Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs
Emai inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories follow the grammatical subject
phrase and precede the initial verb of the predicate phrase. Inflection consists of
affirmative and negative aspect categories. They precede the auxiliary categories of
modality and relative tense, in that order. Preverbs follow auxiliaries.
ASPECT MODALITY RELATIVE-TENSE PREVERB3.1 Inflectional and auxiliary categories
Segmental morphemes that convey affirmative and negative inflection, modality
(deontic and epistemic) and relative tense are the following:
Affirmative Aspect

kpe SubsequentInflection, specifically affirmative and negative aspect, along with subject
phrase tone is the cornerstone of Emai tonal structure within a clause. Affirmative
polarity shows perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect. No segmental forms convey perfect aspect; instead, perfect aspect is signaled by subject phrase tone and
predicate phrase tone. Segmental forms that are mutually exclusive express imperfect and prospective aspect. Imperfect, when realized by a lexical rather than pronominal subject, requires subject concord. In the expression of perfect and prospective aspect, concord is rarely exploited. Distinctions within perfect and prospective
are conveyed by a contrast in subject phrase tone. Negative polarity consists of Perfect, Prospective, and Past Absolute categories. When realized by a lexical rather
than pronominal subject, negation requires subject concord.","[124, 125]"

"6Adverbial adjunctsPostverbal adverbial adjuncts in Emai fall into classes based on their notional semantic character and corresponding information question. Within and across classes, adjuncts are restricted by aspect, polarity, mood and positioning as topic or
focus. In addition, members of some classes are morphosyntactically simple or
complex. Regardless of shape or properties, adverbial adjuncts induce high tone
spread at the right edge of any immediately preceding nominal constituent.
For each of eight adverb classes, there exists a corresponding information question frame. One class, Temporal Deixis, shows two corresponding question frames.
For a ninth class that refers to event rate or sound, there is no corresponding information question.

ØAdverbs from these classes, with the exception of reason and rate, co-occur and
exhibit order relations in a clause. Manner (MA) adverbs are nearer the verb and
Temporal Deixis (TD) farther away. Between are ordered Extent (EX), Mannerdemonstrative (MD), Frequency (FQ), Quantity (QU) and Place (PL). Some adverbs
are mutually exclusive: Manner-demonstrative, Frequency, Quantity and Place.
V6.1MA EX MD / FQ / QU / PL TDOverview of temporal adverbialsTemporal deictic adverbials consist of morphosyntactically simple and complex
forms. They correspond to either or both of the question frames éghè re and í yi. One
class of simple temporal lexemes specifies day units or day subinterval units relative
to moment of utterance. Another class segments the time line into larger-than-day
units.","[313, 314]"
"2.6.1 Stem reduplication
Stem reduplication exhibits five structural classes. It affects noun, adverbial noun,
pronoun and postdeterminer combinations. The classes vary in their effacement of84 | MorphologyNS-1 final vowel or the portion of NS-2 reduplicated. The resulting reduplicated
forms within the five classes serve primarily as functional rather than lexical items.
For one class of reduplicated forms, the entire stem is repeated. The final vowel
or its tone in NS-1 is thus retained. Members denote relational nouns, temporal adverbials, property nouns, abstract nouns and an item in nature. For some, the semantic effect of reduplication maintains the stem referent while maximally extending a key dimension of referent meaning. For others, reduplication generates a
distinct referent. In one case, the stem referent cannot be synchronically identified.
Relational Noun:
óvbíóvbì ‘grandchild’: óvbì ‘offspring of’
égbéègbé ‘very edge of’: égbè ‘side of’
Temporal Adverbial:
éghèéghè ‘all the time, always’: éghè ‘time’
édèédè ‘daily, everyday’: édè ‘day’
èjéèjé ‘quickly, hastily’: èjé ‘quickly’
Property Noun:
ògbónògbón ‘extremely raw’: ògbòn ‘fresh, new’
Abstract Noun:
áèènáèén ‘social intrigues’: áèèn ‘symbol’
àtáàtà ‘truly, sincerely’: àtà ‘truth’
Bird:
ógbé'nógbé'n ‘crested helmet shrike’: ógbé'n (unknown)
A second class of reduplicated forms shows only partial reduplication. The final
vowel of NS-1 is replaced by a copy of the initial vowel of NS-2, the two showing a
high low tone sequence. Members of this class serve as relational nouns, property
nouns, temporal adverbials and postdeterminers. Since lexemes in this class derive
from noun stems that perform similar syntactic functions, the semantic effect of
reduplication is primarily emphatic.
Relational Noun:
éhéèhón ‘extreme edge of’: éhòn ‘ear, edge’
ágbáàgbán ‘very edge of’: àgbàn ‘chin, edge’
ógbòógbàn ‘absolutely diagonal to’: ógbàn ‘at a diagonal’
ékéèkéín ‘extreme bottom’: ékéìn ‘belly, middle of’
égéègén ‘base of, beneath’: ègèìn ‘crotch, underside’
ògùóògúé ‘systematicity’: ògùè ‘skill’
Property Noun:
òhóòhán ‘wrong, incorrect way’: òhàn ‘wrong way’
èkéèkén ‘sandy’: èkèn ‘sand’Reduplication | 85èréèréé ‘bloody’: èrèè ‘blood’
Temporal Adverbial:
ènyéènyáà ‘just now, right now’: ènyáà ‘just now’
ásàásòn ‘every night, nightly’: ásòn ‘night’
úkpùúkpè ‘every year, yearly’: úkpè ‘year’
Postdeterminer:
ódòódàn ‘very different kind’: ódàn ‘different kind of singleton’
édèédàn ‘very different kind of’: édàn ‘different kind of plurality’
èvéèvá ‘two-two each’: èvá ‘two’ (and other cardinal numerals)
Reduplicated forms of a third class show effacement of NS-1 final vowel and its
tone. Lexemes in this class denote kin terms, relational nouns, temporal adverbials
as well as pre- and post-determiners. Since members derive from noun stems performing similar functions, the semantic effect of reduplication denotes an emphatic
quality or a related but distinct referent.
Kin Term:
ínyìnyò ‘maternal grandmother’: ìnyò ‘mother’
érèrà ‘paternal grandfather’: èrà ‘father’
Relational Noun:
ésèsé ‘midst, exact middle’: ésè ‘center’
ìdàmìdámí ‘distant horizon’: ídámà ‘middle’
Temporal Adverbial:
èdèdé ‘moments ago, earlier’: édè ‘day’
ìsòkpísòkpá ‘immediately, at once’: ìsòkpá ‘once’
Predeterminer / Postdeterminer:
élèlà ‘the time unit we discussed’: élà ‘the time unit we discussed’
èvèvá ‘all two, both’: èvá ‘two’ (other cardinal numerals as well)
ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’: ìgbé ‘ten’
A fourth class of reduplicated forms reveals a distinct pattern of vowel effacement. The initial vowel of NS-2 is omitted. Members of this class derive from pronouns for proximal deictic demonstrative relations and result in pronouns. The
semantic effect of reduplication casts an emphatic quality.
Demonstrative Pronoun:
ónánà ‘this very one’: ònà ‘this one’
énánà ‘these very ones’: ènà ‘these ones’
Reduplicated forms in class five manifest still another pattern of effacement.
The final consonant and vowel (CV) of NS-1 elide. Members of this class are the par-86 | Morphologytitive existential pronoun and a lexical noun of Emai’s socio-cultural vocabulary.
The semantic effect of reduplication is emphatic for the pronoun; for the social role
term, it is relative diminution in status.
Pronoun:
óósò ‘someone’: ósò ‘certain one, some one’
Social Role:
òòbà ‘crown prince’: óbá' ‘Oba’2.6.2 Root reduplication and nominalization
Reduplication of verb roots occurs in the nominalization of verbs from nouns. A
stem is formed by reduplicating a verb root and adjoining it to a vowel prefix. Vowel
prefix types link with reduplicated roots in no obvious pattern, although half open
vowels [o] and [e] fail to appear in these reduplicated forms. For some lexemes, the
root is still synchronically available; for others, it remains opaque. Members of this
class denote physical entities, insects as well as social and climatic conditions.
Physical Entity:
ágbúlúgbùlù ‘cart, vehicle’: gbulu ‘to roll’
ígbúlúgbùlù ‘toys of tin or wood’: gbulu ‘to roll’
íkhùìkhúí ‘yam and plantain mash’: khui (khuikhui ‘to crumble’)
Insect:
ìkhúkhù ‘tiny black insect’: khu ‘to chase’
Social Condition:
ìfùnòfúnó ‘unsteadiness, instability’: funo a ‘to extinguish, flicker’
ìtàlòtáló ‘trash talk’: ta-lo ‘to speak repeatedly’
Climatic Condition:
òkhùàkhùà ‘harmattan wind’: khua (khuakhua ‘to be stiff’)
For another class of lexemes, the verb root undergoing reduplication is often
not synchronically available. Lexeme referents denote food, fish, domestic animals,
celestial bodies, landscape, illness, property and flora of the natural environment.
Since there are no synchronic noun stem forms related to these reduplication lexemes, there is no basis for expecting these forms to involve noun stem reduplication. Wherever possible we have thus posited potential verb roots.

Emai exhibits lexical items that reflect contact with various ethnic groups and their
languages in the relatively recent past. As well, some of these lexemes might reflect
a common historical past. For the moment, we do not pursue this historical matter.
Borrowed lexemes derive from English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, among other languages. Most borrowed forms are nouns for concrete or highly abstract objects.
Verbs tend not to be borrowed.
Lexemes that appear borrowed from English denote artifacts, food, locations
and abstractions. Many refer to referents from an English colonial era that persisted
from the 1890s to the 1960s.

Numeral expressions encapsulate within a single semantic domain the range of
Emai morphological types. Analytic compounds, synthetic compounds, derivation
and reduplication are found, as are monomorphemic stem forms. Progressive arithmetic processes of addition and multiplication underlie these lexeme types.
Numbers less than forty are expressed by a root or an analytic compound reflecting addition. Beyond twenty, multiples of twenty are expressed by multiplication, whereas non-multiples of twenty that are still multiples of ten are expressed by
multiplication and addition.
The cardinal numerals for 1-10 are expressed by monomorphemic roots.
òkpá ‘one’
èéà ‘three’
ìíhìèn ‘five’
ìhíón ‘seven’
ìsín ‘nine’èvá ‘two’
èélè ‘four’
èéhàn ‘six’
èén ‘eight’
ìgbé ‘ten’90 | MorphologyNumeral expressions for 11-19 are framed as analytic compounds. Each consists of
the stem ìgbé ‘ten’ followed by a stem selected from 1-9. These analytic compounds
consistently reflect an arithmetic process of addition: ìgbéèvà ‘twelve’ <ìgbé ‘ten’ +
èvà ‘two’>. The only exception is eleven (ìgbóó ‘eleven’ <ìgbé ‘ten’ + óó unknown but
possibly, ‘one’>), whose composition is synchronically opaque.
ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ìgbèéà ‘thirteen’
ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
ìgbìhíón ‘seventeen’
ìgbìsín ‘nineteen’ìgbéèvà ‘twelve’
ìgbèélè ‘fourteen’
ìgbèéhàn ‘sixteen’
ìgbèén ‘eighteen’Numeral expressions between twenty and forty show a different pattern. Multiples of 10 at 20 and 30 consist of monomorphemic stems.
ùúè ‘twenty’ógbàn ‘thirty’Numeral expressions in the twenties and thirties are framed as syntactic phrases
with Comitative conjunct bíì. The phrases consist of ùúè ‘twenty’ or ógbàn ‘thirty’
followed by bíì and a cardinal numeral root less than 10. Lexemes of this type reflect
an addition process.
ùúè bíì ìíhìèn ‘twenty-five’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ùúè bíì òkpá ‘twenty-one’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ùúè bíì ìsín ‘twenty-nine’: ùúè ‘twenty,’ bíì, ìsín ‘nine’
ógbàn bíì ìíhìèn ‘thirty-five’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’
ógbàn bíì òkpá ‘thirty-one’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ógbàn bíì ìsín ‘thirty-nine’: ógbàn ‘thirty,’ bíì, ìsín ‘nine’
Between 40 and 100, multiples of 10 reflect two patterns anchored to whether
they are also multiples of 20. Those with the values 40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and 1600,
for example, are formed by morphological derivation. They are framed by prefix
ègbòò- ‘twenty, score’; it attaches to cardinal root forms. The resulting derivations
reflect a process of multiplication.
ègbòèvá ‘forty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èvá ‘two’
ègbòèéà ‘sixty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èéà ‘three’
ègbòèélè ‘eighty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èélè ‘four’
ègbòìíhìèn ‘one hundred’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ ìíhìèn ‘five’
égbèén ‘one hundred sixty’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ èén ‘eight’
ègbòìgbé ‘two hundred’: ègbòò- ‘twenty/score,’ ìgbé ‘ten’Numeral lexemes and phrases | 91Bimorphemic derived forms act as a base for constructing syntactic phrases 41-49,
61-69, 81-89, 101-109, for example, each framed by Comitative bíì. The resulting
phrases consist of a multiple of 20 followed by bíì and a cardinal stem from 1-9.
ègbòèvá bíì òkpá ‘forty-one’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, òkpá ‘one’
ègbòèvá bíì ìíhìèn ‘forty-five’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìíhìèn ‘five’

Multiples of 10 that are not multiples of 20, i.e. the values 50, 70 and 90, are
framed as syntactic phrases grounded to morphologically derived lexemes. They
consist of the immediately preceding multiple of 20, expressed in its bimorphemic
affixal form, followed by Comitative bíì and the noun for cardinal 10. Multiplication
and addition underlie these numeral expressions.
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbé ‘fifty’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
ègbòèéà bíì ìgbé ‘seventy’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
ègbòèélè bíì ìgbé ‘ninety’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìgbé ‘ten’
There are two morphosyntactic strategies for expressing numbers expanding each of
the above values to cover 51-59, 71-79, and 91-99. In one, multiples of 20 frame complex syntactic phrases involving a single instance of the Comitative conjunct. Resulting numerals consist of a multiple of 20, bíì and a cardinal stem from 11-19.
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbóó ‘fifty-one’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèvá bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifty-five’: ègbòèvá ‘forty,’ bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
ègbòèéà bíì igbóó ‘seventy-one’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèéà bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘seventy-five’: ègbòèéà ‘sixty,’ bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen
ègbòèélè bíì igbóó ‘ninety-one’: ègbòèélè ‘eighty,’ bíì, ìgbóó ‘eleven’
ègbòèélè bíì ìgbìíhìèn ‘ninety-five’: ègbòèélè eighty, bíì, ìgbìíhìèn ‘fifteen’
In an alternative strategy, numerals for 50, 70 and 90 show complex phrases
exhibiting more than one instance of the Comitative. Resulting numerals consist,
respectively, of a multiple of 20 followed by bíì, the cardinal root for 10, another
copy of bíì and a cardinal root selected from 1-9.","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117]"

Temporal relations in multi-clause constructions are designated as subordinate by
several grammatical strategies, namely aspect and relative tense auxiliary (ke, kpe)
or aspectualizer preverb (ghe); complementizer (bi) and Concessive auxiliary (re);
bare noun relative clause head in construction with verb re ‘take’ in series; or verb
in series (se, de) with following embedded complement or bare noun relative clause
head. Temporal relations coded include succession, concidence, condition, extent
and anticipation. Linked subordinate and matrix clauses constrain linear order,
aspect and modality, as well as subject coreference.","[925, 926]"

A temporal relation of immediate succession between events is brought into
perspective by addition of Punctual aspectualizer ghe to a ke marked subordinateTemporal relations | 903clause. ghe signals temporal immediacy between the endpoint of a ke event and the
onset of its matrix event. For immediate succession, ghe is obligatory in the subordinate clause but optional in the matrix. Only ke event endpoint and matrix onset
come into perspective.11

Immediate succession ghe also occurs when a ke clause shows Anticipative aspect.
A relation of temporal immediacy is then defined by a prospective time point for the
ke event relative to onset of matrix event. Although ke event endpoint comes into
perspective through Anticipative ló, onset of the ke event shifts into perspective
when Ingressive ya follows Anticipative ló.

"7.4.3 Matrix clause properties
RD limits construction polarity and mood as well as matrix clause inflection and
acceptance of auxiliaries and preverbs. RD constructions constrain mood and polarity. They take the form of polar questions (ólí ómóhé shén' óì, í khì ólí émà? [the man
PAP.sell it ID be the yam] ‘Did the man sell it, that is the yam?’) and negative statements (ó ì gbè ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè [he NEG kill rat ID be the man] ‘He did not kill a
rat, that is the man’). Never do they appear as prohibitives or imperatives.
RD minimally constrains matrix clause inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. RD
matrix clauses inflect for perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.15

‘The man is about to sell it, that is the yam.’
RD matrix clauses do not restrict modality. They allow deontic Hortative í (ólí
ómòhè í shèn óì, í khì ólí émà [the man HOR sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man should
sell it, that is the yam’). All epistemic judgment types are found: rational Deductive
za (ólí ómòhè záà shén óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PRP.DED sell it ID be the yam] ‘The
man must have sold it, that is the yam’), Resultative za, speculative Certaintive ma,
Dubitatives bia and vba (ólí ómóhé vbá' shén óì, í khì ólí émà? [the man PAP.DUB sell

man PAP.HYP sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man would have sold it, that is the yam’).
Matrix clauses in RD constructions permit each relative tense auxiliary. Anterior
ke and Subsequent kpe occur, with kpe serving to illustrate their behavior (ólí ómóhé
kpé' shén óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PAP.SUB sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man still sold
it, that is the yam’).
In RD matrix clauses, preverbs are not limited. Each aspectualizer form appears,
namely phasal Repetitive che, Additive gbo, Durative se, and Punctual ghe, as well
as boundary forms Conative òó, Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Past Absolutes ya
and mo. Class behavior is suggested by Durative se (ólí ómòhè séè shén óì, í khì ólí
émà [the man PRP.DUR sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man still sold it, that is the yam’)
and Conative òó (ólí ómòhè ó ó' shèn óì, í khì ólí émà [the man SC CON sell it ID be the
yam] ‘The man went to sell it, that is the yam’).
RD matrix clauses allow temporal and evaluative preverbs. They show kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ and tua ‘hurriedly,’ as indicated by kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò
tón óì, í khì ólí ófè [the man PAP.earlier roast it ID be the rat] ‘The man roasted it
earlier on, that is the rat’). Only kuku ‘after all’ among evaluative preverbs is precluded in RD matrix clauses, (*ò kúkù é ólí émàè léé, ì khì ólí ómóhé nà [he PRP.POEV
eat the food TEMP ID be the man this] ‘After all, he finished eating the food, that is
the man’). Remaining evaluatives, woo ‘instead’ and duu ‘for no reason,’ are acceptable (ò dúù gbé ólí ófè, í khì ólí ómóhé nà [he PRP.EVAL kill the rat ID be the man
this] ‘He killed the rat for no reason, that is this man’).
Uniformly grammatical in RD matrix clauses are subject attributive preverbs.
Among them are dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’376 | Noncanonical constructionsgbúdu ‘courageously,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ totóbo ‘intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly.’ Illustrating their acceptability are forms dábo (ó dá'bò fí ólì èkpà fí à, í khì ólí
ómóhé nà [he PAP.deliberately threw the bag project CS ID be the man this] ‘He
deliberately threw the bag away, that is this man’) and dóbo (ò dóbò é ólì émàè, í khì
ólí ómóhé nà [he PRP.mistakenly eat the food ID be the man this] ‘He mistakenly ate
the food, that is this man’).
RD allows quantity preverbs in its matrix clause. One finds both Collective gba
(é gbá' é ólí émà, í khì élí ímòhè [they PAP.COL eat the yam ID be the men] ‘They ate
the yam together, that is the men’) and Emphatic Reflexive dobo (ó dóbó' óì é ólí
émà, í khì ólí ómòhè [he PAP.REFL him eat the yam ID be the man] ‘He himself ate
the yam, that is the man’). However, dobo only appears when its subject corresponds to RD position (*ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì é óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PAP.REFL him
eat it ID be the yam] ‘The man himself ate it, that is the food’).16 RD matrix clauses
also allow quantity preverbs of intensification, namely zemi (ólí ómóhé zé'mì é óì, í
khì ólí émàè [the man PAP.ABSI eat it ID be the food] ‘The man ate a lot of it, that is
the food’) and zeze (ólí ómóhé zé'zè é vbì ò, í khì ólí émàè [the man PAP.NABI eat LOC
it ID be the food] ‘The man ate a bit of it, that is the food’).
RD matrix clauses permit the final class of preverbs. Manner-demonstratives in
RD constructions are grammatical, as shown by ìná (ólí ómóhé íná' dín óì, í khì ólí
éwè [the man PAP.PMD tie it ID be the goat] ‘The man tied it this way, that is the
goat’) and ìyó (ólí ómóhé íyó' é óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PAP.DMD eat it ID be the
yam] ‘The man ate it that way, that is the yam’).
Additional constraints affect Right Dislocation in subordinate clauses. RD constructions never appear in indicative khi, conditional si, or subjunctive li complements, as khi illustrates.

‘He went to Oke, that is Oje, in order to play ayo.’7.5 Information questions
Information questions are shaped by interrogative pronouns or by pronouns in construction with other grammatical or lexical forms. Interrogative pronouns in most
circumstances occur in clause initial question position. Structural shape of information questions varies along several dimensions. Some interrogative pronouns
require a matrix clause auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle or verb in series. One
question type shows no interrogative pronoun.
For three interrogative pronouns their sound shape varies according to phonological environment. In echo questions where each occurs in situ, interrogative pronouns exhibit a final vowel sequence èé with low high tone: óèé ‘who,’ émèé ‘what’
and ébèé ‘where.’ In direct and indirect questions, where they are clause initial,
phonological realization of these pronouns is controlled by an adjacent segment.
When the following segment is a vowel, the e is retained with high downstep tone
(óé', émé', ébé', respectively). When the following segment is a consonant, the [e] is
realized as [i] and retains a high downstep tone (óí', émí', ébí', respectively).
Interrogative pronouns are fundamental to information questions. Each assumes a basic or derived shape. Four reflect the semantic categories Space (‘where’),
Person (‘who’), Object (‘what’) and Quantity/Cost (‘how many/how much’).
ébé' / ébí' ‘where’
émé' / émí' ‘what’óé' / óí' ~ éé' / éí' ‘who’
ékà ‘how much / how many’Three interrogative pronouns formulate a question constituent with a head noun (N)
to articulate another four information question types: Possession (‘whose’), Kindred
(‘what kind’), Quantity (‘how many’) and Cost (‘how much’).
N ísi óé' / óí' ~ éé' / éí' ‘whose’
N émé' / émí' ‘what kind’N ékà ‘how many’
N ísì ékà ‘how much’Two interrogative pronouns show complexity of a different sort. One combines with
an obligatory preverb i/e, or with preverb i/e and verb in series se to convey Manner
(‘how’) and Extent/Frequency (‘to what extent’), respectively. Another combines
with verb ze or postverbal particle li/ni to express Cause/Purpose (‘why’) and Conditional Purpose (‘what for’).","[400, 401, 402, 403]"

Topic constructions provide an equally mixed impression with other subordinate
clause types. Topic constituents are acceptable with subordinate temporal clauses
marked by Anterior ke. However, they are not permissible within purposive clauses
marked by subjunctive li (*òjè yé òkè lí ìyòìn, ó mìè éhé rè fí ísè [Oje move.to Oke

Right dislocation (RD) or antitopic constructions consist of two major constituents, a
matrix clause with a falling intonation contour followed by a constituent wherein a
noun phrase is preceded by Equational Identity copula khi and its obligatory Identity subject pronoun í. A right dislocated constituent functions to identify the referent
of a matrix clause grammatical relation assumed by the speaker to be unclear.

RD constructions constrain syntactic shape of the right dislocated constituent and
restrict matrix clause inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. RD occurrence in embedded or subordinate clauses is also limited. As for RD position itself, it corresponds to
grammatical relations subject, monotransitive direct object and locative argument,
with additional restrictions imposed on those relations.","[394, 395]"

Anticipative ló or any other aspect. Subordinate clauses in prospective condition

intensifier preverb in simple preverb phrases or in Specifier copula óò constructions.

Alternative forms articulate direct and indirect questions of Person. An interrogative
pronoun with the number shapes singular óe'/ói' and plural éé'/éí' frame Person
direct questions. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular o, plural e) occurs in matrix
subject position. For indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni, a zero
pronoun corresponds to the interrogative pronoun for person.

Indirect questions of Person rely on the relative pronoun ólì/élì with its singular/plural forms. Question position in indirect interrogatives never accepts pronoun
óé'/óí' ~ éé' /éí'. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular ó, plural é) occupies subject
position. When the question word corresponds to indirect object marked by Applicative li/ni, the matrix clause exhibits a zero pronoun.

Responses to Person direct questions consist of semantically relevant noun phrases
in focus position, in simple syntactic noun phrases or in Specifier copula óò constructions. Disfavored are relevant noun phrases in situ.

Direct and indirect questions of Possessor are framed by Person interrogative pronouns and relative pronouns. However, question shape varies according to direct or
indirect status. Direct questions utilize interrogative pronoun óé'/óí'~éé'/éí' as complement of an Associative ísì phrase, the entire phrase being in question position.
(83) a. éwé ísì óé' ólí ómóhé nwú'

b. éwé ísì éé' ólí ómóhé nwú'
lí
ònwìmè?
goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’
Indirect questions of Possessor assume either of two shapes. When the question
position constituent corresponds to a matrix relation other than subject, the relative
pronoun ólì appears in question position and a personal pronoun (òí) occupies the
corresponding matrix clause position.17
(84) a. ì één

c. *ì één
éwé ísì ólí ójé nwú'
lí
ònwìmè.
I PRP.know goat ASS one Oje PAP.take APP farmer
‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’
When the question constituent in an indirect question with Possessor corefers to
matrix clause subject, an entire Associative ísì phrase (éwé ísì ólí) occurs in embedded clause initial position. The relative pronoun ólí serves as Possessor. Subject in
the matrix clause then requires a personal pronoun (e.g. ó).

As responses, direct questions of Possessor accept headless Associative ísì phrases
in focus position, headless associative phrases in Specifier copula óò constructions,
headless associative phrases or Possessor noun phrases. Unacceptable are simple
noun phrases in Specifier copula constructions, or full associative phrases in situ.

Direct and indirect questions of Time show éghè ‘time’ in question position and verb
re ‘take’ in series in the matrix clause. Direct questions show an optional positive
focus particle after éghè.
(87) a. éghè ólí ómóhé ré'

The interrogative pronoun émé'/émí' frames direct and indirect Object questions.
Direct questions show émé'/émí' in question position. Indirect questions also show
émé'/émí' in clause initial position under the verb een, as head of an unmarked
relative clause.19

Direct and indirect Cause questions are framed by émé'/émí' in question position,
the verb ze ‘cause/allow’ and an embedded S-complement, either indicative khi or
purposive result li re.20

Direct questions of Cause reveal responses correlating with embedded complement
type. When the question employs indicative khi, responses show a clause headed by
òhíó ‘cause’ with a following khi clause. Disfavored are S-complements without òhíó
and khi. Also unacceptable are responses with èrìmí or èmìdí, whose meanings
closely relate to òhíó.

headed by òhíó followed by khi and a prospective aspect or a purposive clause containing an embedded clause with Resultative preverb za. Unacceptable are prospective aspect clauses lacking an S-complement or responses shaped by èrìmí or èmìdí.","[407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415]"
