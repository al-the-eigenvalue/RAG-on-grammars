"Basic word orderThe most frequent word order in terms of the core constituents is
subject-object-verb, which is illustrated by most of the examples
in this grammar. However, the word order, in particular in finite
clauses, is rather flexible and is more appropriately described by
the following “discourse-oriented” scheme:(619) Topic—Focus—verb-(After-Topic)
Since the Focus is grammaticalized, this scheme imposes two strict
constraints on the word order variation: the Focus cannot followthe verb (see £4.2.2.3), and the A constituent cannot intervene
between the O Focus and the finite verb. As shown in 1.1.1, the
latter rule can play a major role in distinguishing the participants
of a clause.",[361]
"323Chapter 9
Syntax of the clauseThis chapter discusses the case marking of the core participantsin finite (1.1) and non-finite (1.2) clauses. The most remarkable feature of case marking in Yukaghir is the extensive employment of the well-known affinities between the core participant rolesand pragmatic (or information-packaging) properties of NPs (1.3).
Section 1.4 provides summaries of syntactic properties which may
serve to identify the grammatical relations of subject, direct object
and indirect object.
The most frequent word order is verb-final, yet the relative
order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles(1.5).
Verb valence patterns are described in section 2.
provides an overview of clausal adjuncts.","[343, 344, 345]"
"Note that a logically possible variant of dealing with such a situation
would be to put the Focus O constituent in the clause-initial position,
before the A constituent (which would have been then included into
the scope of assertion). Yet this variant is prohibited by the word-order
rules, i.e., this constituent order is not allowed in the Focus construction;
see 9.1.5.1.",[610]
"In most instances these word order options cannot be distinguished (just
because the subject is very often omitted).
For examples of questions to the $/O constituent, see 12.3.1.1.",[610]
"342Chapter9. Syntax of the clauseThere are two types of deviations from the SOVorder:rightdislocation (1.5.2) and clause-initial objects (1.5.3). NP discontinuity is possible but rather infrequent (1.5.4).
1.5.2. Right dislocation
The subject NP can be post-posed; in most cases, this order involves highly predictable (recoverable) subjects, i.e., it occurs under discourse conditions typical for so-called afterthought topicalization in other languages.","[361, 362]"

and it is preferred in main clauses. However, in the latter case,
other word orders are possible.
NPs are easily dropped whenever recoverable from the discourse
context and/or speech situation.
There is virtually no coordination, either between NPs or between clauses. The main strategy of NP conjunction is comitative
marking, and the main strategy of clause conjunction is clause
chaining.","[28, 29]"

"2.3.1. Case marking and grammatical Focus
Case marking patterns in main clauses are dominated by the Focus
system, Grammatical Focus is marked by means of the Predicativecase and an appropriate verb form (see Table 3). This marking
works on an ergative basis, that is, it can be applied to intransitive
subjects and direct objects, as shown in (7):(7)a. tattouke-lekjedej-lCAdog-PREDappear-SF‘Then a/the dog appeared.’ |K3]
b. loéil-ek — ta-ta
fire-PRED here-therepiecet-nu-l’el-mele
kindle-[PFV-INFR-OF:3SG‘(She) made campfires here and there.’ [K3]
The major function of the grammatical Focus is to delimit the
scope of assertion from the preceding material (cither within oroutside the given clause), whereby the NP marked for Focus is
conceived as the left-most (i.e., the first in the linear order) constituent within the scope of assertion.
If a clause is marked for grammatical Focus, no other case marking of core participants is needed. Similarly, if the subject is first
or second person, and the direct object is third person, both occur10Chapter i. Introductionin the Nominative (unmarked) case (8a). Otherwise, the casemarking pattern is nominative-accusative (8b)--(8c).

kill-TR:38GExamples (8)-{9) show that Yukaghir lacks a uniform dircct object encoding; the choice of marking depends on placement of the
Focus, person of the subject, and the referential properties of the
NP itself.","[29, 30]"
"To sum up, despite (or rather independently of) the grammatical
Focus system, Yukaghir appears to be a highly subject-prominent
and role-dominated language, where the primary participant role(A/S) serves as a major syntactic function (which can be identified
as “subject”).
1.4.2. Direct object properties (O participant)
The direct object (O participant) can be distinguished from other
objects by the following properties:
e The O participant can receive the grammatical Focus (Predicative) marking, which is impossible for other objects.
e The O participant can take the Nominative case form (under
the conditions described in 1.1.1, 1.2.2).e TheO participantcan be promotedto the S position bymeans of the Resultative (6.3.5.6.2).
e The coreference of the O participant with the A participantis marked by the Reflexive marking on the verb (see 6.4.5.3,14.1.1.1).e The O participant can be relativized (see 11.3 for details).
e The O participant can control scalar quantifier floating (see8.3).",[360]

"The ethnic groups of Nelemnoye are Yukaghirs (~ 54%), Yakuts(~ 22%), Russians (~ 19%), and Evens (~ 4%);° the languages
spoken, in order of prevalence, are Russian, Yakut, Yukaghir, and
Even. Of the 133 Yukaghirs, only nine named Yukaghir as their
first language; for about 50 it is the mother tongue, i.e., it was
acquired in childhood from parents (Vakhtin 1992:53, his Table
6). The oldest segment of the population is multilingual, so that
Yukaghir is spoken by some Evens and Yakuts as well.",[40]
"Nominalpredicatesand grammaticalFocus2.2. Focus as a clause-internal phenomenon:summaryThe grammatical Focus in Yukaghir exhibits a number of syntactic
features which identify it as a clause-internal phenomenon:
« The word order in the Focus construction not only maintains
the regularities attested in other clause types, but even adheres to them more strictly, that is to say, the Focus NP is not
split off from the remainder of the clause. In particular, the
A constituent cannot intervene between the Focus and theverb form (see 9.1.5.1). This linearization rule can be viewed
as grammaticalization of the information-packaging function
of Focus marking, which implies that the presupposed mate-rial (in particular, the topic) should precede the Focus (see
Section 3). On the other hand, it is in obvious contradiction with a cleft-like analysis, which would suggest that the
A constituent belongs to a free relative clause.e Theaccessibility constraintsstrongerthanon Focusthose on relativization;markingare muchin particular,the Aconstituent is accessible for relativization (11.3.1.1), but not
for the Focus marking (9.1.1.1). The Focus marking is organized in such a way as to ensure the unique identification of
the clause-internal role of the NP: it can be applied only to
one participant role per clause type.
e The Focus S constituent maintains the syntactic propertiesassociated with the subjects (9.1.4.1, 2.4}.
e The SF and OF forms of the verb, in contrast with the similar forms used for relativization, have the full range of finitemorphology (see 6.1.2.1, 6.1.3.2).
These properties suggest that the Focus in Yukaghir is grammaticalized as a clause-internal phenomenon: the strong syntactic constraints on Focus marking are not motivated by the constraints on
relativization, nor by the Focus semantics per se. Rather, they
are targeted at integrating the Focus into the clause-internal syntax, so that the Focus marking unambiguously assigns the NP toa clause-internal function (participant role).",[472]
"Thus, Yukaghir appears to show a special (“Focus-oriented”) case of split intransitivity:> the S participant takes either Nominative marking {associated with the A participant in a328Chapter 9. Syntaz of the clausetransitive clause) or Predicative marking (associated with the O
participant in a transitive clause).
These marking properties naturally give rise to the followingquestion: Which grammatical units (if any) can be associated with
syntactic functions (or grammatical relations), such as subject,
direct object, etc.; in other words, do the participant roles identify
the syntactic functions, or are these functions identifiable only for
a given packaging variant? To put the question straightforwardly,is it only the Nominative (non-Focus) primary participant (A/S)
that can be identified as the subject of a clause, or is subjecthoodmaintained for the Predicative (Focus) S as well?
The former analysis might appear more plausible not only on
morphological grounds, but also on the basis of functional considerations, inasmuch as some sort of topichood is generally associated with subjects. It appears, however, that Yukaghir grammar assigns the subject properties to the primary participant role(A/S), be it the Focus or not, rather than to the Nominative (nonFocus) A/S. That is to say, the syntactic generalizations of the
type cross-linguistically associated with “subjects” are to be stated
over the participant roles, without regard for the Focus marking.
Various syntactic constructions that substantiate this claim are described in different parts of this grammar; see 1.4 for a summary
of this evidence.
1.2. Non-finite clauses
The case marking of the core participants in non-finite clause differs from that outlined above for finite clauses:
e Focus marking is impossible in non-finite clauses.
e The primary participants of Nominal and Attributive relativeclauses are encoded as Possessive modifiers (see 1.2.1).
e Neutral O marking in non-finite clause is compatible with the
third person A participant, under pragmatic conditions which
can be formulated in terms of oppositions between global andlocal participants (1.2.2).","[347, 348]"

The suffix is productive, that is, it can be applied whenever
the verb signifies an action which can be carried out intentionally
(of course, except for the verbs of motion), yet it is being rapidly
replaced by constructions with a verb of motion plus the Supine
(supported by the similar Russian pattern), see 17.4.4.",[229]
"For instance, all non-finite clauses in (694a) signify situations prior
to the finite clause situation, while their relative temporal order
remains unspecified.
2.3. Backgrounding
Clause chaining involves a backgrounding/foregrounding semantic effect; the primary prominence is accorded to the finite-clause
situation. This semantic effect plays a major role in two sorts of
phenomena:1. The switch-reference clause (in contrast to the finite clause)
can represent only presupposed (or given) information presupposition; such a clause serves as a linking device (2.3.1)and/or as a temporal setting (2.3.2).
2. In simultaneous ordinary chaining, the structural derankingis not determined by the temporal order of events (in contrast to the consecutive ordinary chaining, see 2.2); hence,
the choice of the finite clause signals the relative prominence
of the propositions (2.4.2).
2.3.1. Non-finite clauses as a linking device
A chain-initial clause can refer back to the foregoing finite clause;
such a clause simply recapitulates the preceding finite clause, but
in a switch-reference form and with omitted nominal constituents.",[404]
"PreluminariesAs a first approximation, the morphological means of aspect marking can be described by the following scheme, which reflects the
linear order of various aspectual suffixes within a verb form:(348) [[[ROOT-INTERNAL ASPECT]-RESULTATIVE/INGRESSIVE]IMPERFECTIVE/ HABITUAL]
The basic opposition between Perfective and Imperfective comprises two morphological “layers”: the Internal Aspect marking,
on the one hand, and the regular Imperfective (3.2) and Habitual(3.4) marking, on the other.",[202]
"The Syntaz is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less traditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinctions expressedin Yukaghir,that is, the constructions are classi-fied according to functional considerations, which helps to high-light the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplifyvarious constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the onehand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of information on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the “boundaries” set. by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contradictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant fragments of fhe grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the grammar (c.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the16Chapter1. Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977} and Language Typology and Syntactic Description (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describethe language “in its own terms”.
3.3. Data for this study and exemplification
This grammar is based on two types of data: authentic texts in
contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir and linguistic interviews with its
native speakers (see Acknowledgmenis). My text database comprises texts published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1989 and texts writtendown by Nikolay Vakhtin (1987) and myself (1987, 1992);* some
of the latter are published in (Maslova 2001), and some are included in this grammar {sce Appendix 3); in order to increase thereliability of data, al] controversial and/or questionable sentences
of these texts have been double-checked with native speakers.?
As discussed in Chapter 2, Kolyma Yukaghir has been under
strong pressure from Russian for at least several decades. This,
in combination with the well-known methodological drawbacks of
interviews, makes this sort of data far less reliable than those
elicited from authentic texts. That is why I tried to use only
text examples for illustrative purposes. As a result, some of these
examples might seem too long and complex for the point they are
intended to illustrate. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
an authentic sentence “simplified” by a linguist for some didactic
purposes is not a reliable cxample anymore. In the case of such
languages as Yukaghir, the “unnecessary” complexity of examples
is the price to be paid for reliability of data. Even if I had a
simpler and, in some sense, “clearer” example in my field notes,
I always chose in favor of a text example.° In some cases, whereAboutthis grammar17this seemed to be inevitable, I did “shorten” illustrative sentences;
note that all such omissions are shown by <...>; such examples
should not be taken as “complete sentences”.
There is, of course, a range of pheuomena which cannot be
appropriately described in this fashion because they are absent or
rare in the texts, but are readily produced by my informants in an
interview. ‘These phenomena are described in the grammar on the
basis of my field notes, but with explicit reservations concerning
the source of the data. If an example elicited in an interviewis included in the grammar (in order to avoid loss of significant
information), the source is indicated by the letter “I” after the
idiomatic translation.
8.4.","[35, 36, 37]"
"Compulsory Focus markingThere are a few easily identifiable environments which always trigger Focus marking, that is, discourse or clause-internal contexts
in which Focus marking is compulsory. This class comprises environments where the situation being described is taken to constitute the presupposed or implied information (i.e., the finite verb
belongs to the pragmatic presupposition of the clause; see 3.1.1-3.1.2) and the contexts of explicit contrast associated with the
S/O constituent (3.1.3).
Note that these environments are defined for both S/O constituents as a whole and for modifiers within such NPs, i.e., the
Focus-marking system generally does not distinguish between theSemantics of grammatical Focus459Focus on the whole constituent and on one of its subconstituents
(see, however, 5.4.1.3, for the effect of this distinction on the choiceof the Predicative marker on NP).
3.1.1. Question words
If the 8/O constituent is represented by an interrogative pronoun
or contains a question word, it has to be marked as the Focus(796).","[478, 479]"
"Furthermore, it can be ratedas “corrupted” not only by the previous generation, but by the
speakers themselves. Yet, to some extent, this strategy of “survival
through modification” is approved by the oldest speakers, that is,the speakers of the “purest” existing variety: they themselves do
use a special simplified Yukaghir-based jargon when addressing
younger people, just in order to be understood, yet to maintain
communication in their mother tongue.
Now, it is clear that this strategy has been applied at least
since the end of the 19% century, which means that the current
group of “best speakers” used to represent a “corrupted” version
a couple of dozens years ago. Some of them are aware of the
differences between their own language and the language their
parents used to speak(occasionally, myquestions were answeredlike “I would say it this way, but my father would have said it
differently”). Even more so, they are aware of “mistakes” in the
language spoken by their fellow-citizens, hence low ratings of their
language competence.",[44]

The order of clauses in such a chain is iconic, i.e. it reflects the temporal order of events; thus, the temporal interpretation of clause
chains does not differ from the “default” interpretation of sequences
of finite clauses. The deranking is also uniquely determined by thetemporal order (the finite clause always describes the last event),
hence, the backgrounding effect is not signiftcant. Finally, the semantic cohesion amounts to the temporal adjacency of events andsome sort of discourse coherence (or thematic unity). In sum, the
chaining is employed simply as a discourse structuring device and
involves a minimum of semantic implications.
The following sections demonstrate that each of the properties
outlined above can have a more significant impact on the interpretation of a clause chain. This semantic variation correlates withthe degree of structural cohesion: the “loose” chains as in (692) exhibit the linear structure, while a higher degree of backgroundingor semantic cohesion may involve the nesting or merged structure
(1.3). Besides, the degree of semantic cohesion may determine the
choice of the Perfective vs. Imperfective SS form in a consecutivechain (see 2.4.1). However, no strict grammatical distinctions can
be drawn between various semantic subtypes of ordinary chains.

3. RelativeclausesThere are two types of constructions involving a non-finite clause
as a noun modifier, Nominal relative construction and Attributive
relative construction. In the Nominal relative clause the subject
of the relative clause is construed as the grammatical Possessor of
a nominal verb form. In the Attributive relative clause, this is not
the case; on the contrary, the subject of the relative clause can be
construed as the grammatical Possessor of the relativized NP (see9.1.2.1 for examples).
Nomina! relative clauses are formed by the Action Nominal
form or by the Result Nominal form. Attributive relative clausesare formed by means of the dedicated Attributive forms (6.1.2)
or the Action Nominal form. Thus, the Action Nominal is used
in both relativization strategies. These constructions are formally
distinguished by the placement of the Possessive marker crossreferencing the subject of the relative clause: in the AttributiveRelative clauses417relative construction, it is placed on the head noun, in the Nominal
relative construction, on the verb form itself.
The Attributive relative clause is the primary relativizationstrategy, i.e., this strategy is used for subject relativization (3.1).
The Nominal relative clause plays a rather marginal role and isemployed primarily for relativization of spatial and temporal adverbials (3.2).
3.1.","[436, 437]"
"Correlative relative clausesCorrelative relative clauses are madeup as finite indirect ques-tions, with the demonstrative pronoun tamun ‘that’ (889a)-(889b)
or a full NP (890) serving as the correlate in the main clause; in one
instance, the correlate in the main clause is the universal quantifier(889c),
This pattern can be used for the same types of relativization asthe Attributive relative clauses (12.3.1): for relativization of the
subject (889a), of the direct object (889b)-(889c), of the Possessor
(890a), of the temporal (890b) and spatial (890c) adverbial. The
spatial relative clause (890c) can combine a question word with the
Result Nominal form (cf. the similar effect in correlative adverbial
clauses constructed according to the same pattern).",[530]

If the relativized participant is the direct object, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the O participant of the relative
clause situation. Thus, the O participant is represented by thesubject NP (this constituent is shown in boldface in (772)). This
structure clearly distinguishes such constructions from their simpleClauseswith nominal predicates443transitive counterparts:(772)adugnsoromothis

‘This is a thing the rich did in order to deceive

those in (772)) can be also involved in the Periphrastic past forms,
which entails reanalysis of the construction as a simple clause,
hence, the Accusative marking of the O constituent (see examplesin 6.2.9.2.2).89
1.1.4. Result Nominal clauses as nominal predicatesThe Result Nominal clause (6.1.3.4) can function as a nominal

"In the most general terms,the effect of Russian contact onKolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from origi-nal Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obligative modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construction with a Russian predicative loanword nado ‘is-necessary’ and anominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:(16)a. tamunmin-ginadothat
take-POSS necessary
‘It is necessary to take it.’
b. tamunthatmin-mozetake-PRSP{TR:1SG)‘It, is necessary /inevitable to take it, I should take it.’KolymaandTundraYukaghir27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out’ Yukaghir synthetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yukaghir has a verbal suffix -7- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
cither in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b}. Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to that found in many European languages (including Russian),eg, (17c):

‘He went to look at this.’b. ans t-ga-t

‘He went to look for it.’
c. ans’i-din
kewe-s’
search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
‘He went to look for it.’
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the pat-terns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yukaghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).
5. Kolymaand TundraYukaghirThe Kolyma aud Tundra Yukaghir languages used to be described
as dialects. which seems to be misleading in view of the significant28Chapter 2. KolymaYukaghir and its speakersdistinctions in lexicon, grammar, and phonology. Presumably due
to the extensive language contacts, the lexical distinctions cven
within the basic vocabulary are so great that glottochronological
counts give ca. 2000 years of divergence (Nikolaeva and Helimsky
1997:155-156). The grammatical divergent features seem to have
been underestimated in previous studies of Yukaghir, probably
because neither of the grammars was known well enough. That
is why both existing monographs on Yukaghir (Krejnovich 1938;
1982) treat the two languages together, although some divergent
features are mentioned. The present grammar deviates from this
tradition and treats Kolyma Yukaghir as a distinct language to bedescribed in its own right.","[46, 47, 48]"
"Attributive relative clausesThe instances of Attributive relativization fall into four classes
according to the syntactic role of the relativized constituent: thesubject (3.1.1), the direct object (3.1.2), the spatial or temporal
Locative (3.1.3), and the Possessor of the (intransitive) subject
(3.1.4).
This distribution seems to be typologically remarkable, if not
exceptional, since the primary relativization strategy appears to
be applied for relativization of the highest and the lowest ranksin the Noun Accessibility Hierarchy (Keenan and Comrie 1977).
Two major factors may have determined the attested distribution:
e The accessibility of spatial and temporal adverbials is supported by the existence of the minor Nominal relativizationstrategy (see 3.2), which can use the same morphological resources (Action Nominal form).
e Possessor relativization seems to be related to topicalization
by means of Possessive marking (see 8.2.2.2), i.e., it may be
accounted for in terms of Topic relativization.
Generally, the verb forms do not mark the case role of the relativized constituent. However, they show some sort of (not fully
grammaticalized) orientation toward various types of constituents:
e The Passive Attributive form cannot be applied for relativization of the subject and the Possessor.

"Thetic clausesSF marking is employed in order to impose the so-called thetic,

is, to present a state of affairs (an event together with the entities involved in this event} as a unitary whole, without analysis
into two “packaging” units corresponding to the notions of sub-ject (topic) and predicate (comment).",[484]
"NP4, NPconjunction313conjunctionFollowing Stassen (forthcoming), the concept of NP conjunction
is taken to cover all cases where one type of participation in the
event is ascribed to two (or more) separate entities (represented
by different lexical items). Yukaghir has three different strategiesfor NP conjunction, which make use of the Comitative case (4.1),
asyndeton (4.2) and the connective adverb tahile (4.3).
4.1, Comitative strategy
The Comitative strategyrepresentsa sort of intermediate casebetween the coordination of NPs (and-like) and the comitative
adjunct (with-like), a situation which seems to be fairly typical for
languages without a separate morpheme for “and” (Mithun 1988;Stassen forthcoming).
The Comitative marker -n’e (5.4.3.2.1) can be employed to con-join two (and only two) NPs representing the subject (590) or the
object (591) participants (it is not applied to more marginal participants). This construction is also possible with the alternative
Comitative form in -n’it ~ -n’ut; see 5.4.2.3.2 for examples.","[332, 333]"

"Chapter13Sentence types and negationThis chapter deals with grammatical manifestation of illocutionarydistinctions (Sections 1-3) and negation (Section 4). Yukaghir
distinguishes Declarative sentences (which are not discussed as
such), Imperative sentences (Section 1), polar (2.1) and questionword questions (2.2), and two minor types: Exclamations (3.1)
and Optative sentences (3.2).
The verb forms used in major sentence types are described in
6.1.1; this chapter is concerned with syntactic properties associated with distinct types, in particular, their characteristic particles(2.1.2, 2.1.3, 3.2).
Section 5 describes the syntactic strategies of reporting the contents of a speech act, including the attested peripheral uses of these
strategies.
1. ImperativesentencesThe imperative sentence type is distinguished by means of verb
morphology, that is, by use of the Imperative verb forms (see
6.1.1). Therefore, this sentence type is described and exemplified
in 6.2.8; this section contains only some marginal notes.
In order to propose a common action (i.e., instead of the 1PL
Imperative), the main (Indicative) 1PL form can be used, with or,
less frequently, without the Future marker (see also 6.2.3).","[492, 493]"

The second type of information structure is likely to occur if the

opposed to the conditional setting (roughly, it can be conceived
of as an answer to a question like ‘What will happen if...’). In
this situation, the most significant information-structuring bound-Semantics of grammatical Focus467ary lies between the conditional clause and the main clause, rather

Parts of speech and inflectional
paradigmsThis chapter introduces a classification into parts of speech which
forms the basis for the further morphological description. Since
major classes of lexical items are distinguished morphologically,
the chapter also introduces major inflectional patterns, nominaland verbal (Section 1), and a minor locative pattern (2.2) which
is characteristic of spatial adverbs and postpositions.
The most typologically important feature of the Yukaghir partof-speech system is the absence of adjectives (Krejnovich 1982:97-112). This issue is discussed in Section 3.
Closed word classes and their inflectional features are outlined
in Section 4.
1. Nounsvs.verbsThere are two major inflectional paradigms, nominal (1.1) and
verbal (1.2). Thus, nouns and verbs are easily distinguished morphologically (1.3).
1.1. Nomenal paradigm
The nominal inflection comprises a Plural marker, Possessive
markers, and Case markers, ordered according to the followingscheme (the derivational size markers follow the Plural marker):
(101) Nominal inflection: X-NUMBER-(SIZE)~POSSESSIVE-CASE

Generally, incorporation-like phenomena are not characteristic of
Yukaghir, and the status of these cases within its grammar remains
unclear. It should be noted that neither a verb like *pgme+aysi‘lice-search’ nor one like *azu } medi- ‘language-understand’ exists
in Yukaghir independently; these combinations are possible only
in the context of the reciprocal. The form n’e-pgme-ans’i-jejl’i ‘we

a text written down by myself in 1992, but I have not managedtoelicit any other instances of this phenomenon during my field work.
It thus remains unclear whether there are strong lexical restrictions
on this phenomenon, or if it is a rare (perhaps marginal), butfree (with respect to the Icxical items involved) type of reciprocal

Lexicalization.
Some combinations of the reciprocal
marker and verb stem are apparently lexicalized, e.g., n’e-mejnu-‘to get married, to join’ (from mejnu- ‘to take something’),
ne-lej-nu-l-ben ‘predator’ (RECP-eat-IPFV-ATTR-RELNR), lit. ‘one
who eats cach other’.

1,4. Detached nominal complements
In a few examples, the complement co-occurs with an ordinary
NP filling the same valence slot of the complement-taking verb.
In such constructions, the complement takes the postverbal linear
position, while the more common preverbal position is occupied bythe ordinary NP. The sentences in (724) illustrate the case where
the O slot is filled by an ordinary NP and the clause is followed
by the complement with the subject referentially identical to thatNP. Note that this is the only (and extremely rare) construction
type that allows the reflexive possessive pronoun representing the
subject of a Nominal clause to be controlled by the direct. object(and not by the subject) of the matrix clause (724a):Nominal(724)a. margil’

On the other hand, examples (725) show that this referential identity is not a necessary condition for such a construction; (725a)
illustrates the detached complement semantically associated with
the O slot, (725b), with the S slot. Unfortunately, such examples
are too rare for any detailed description.","[428, 429]"
"It is shown that thesubject properties in Yukaghir are associated with the primary
participant, independently of the Focus marking. On the contrary,
there are no behavioral properties which would be associated withthe Nominative A/Sparticipant alone (in contrast to the Focus $participant and other types of constituents, see 1.1.2). On the basis of this evidence, it can be assumed that the syntactic functions
have to be identified on the level of participants, without regardto Focus marking.
Sections 1.4.2-1.4.3 summarize the syntactic properties which
may distinguish the syntactic functions of direct object (O participant of transitive clause} and indirect object (Dative participantof ditransitive clause).
All relevant constructions are described elsewhere in the grammar. This section can serve as an index to the respective parts of
the grammar.",[358]

The Locative form of this demonstrative has a function which cannot be derived from the meanings of the constituent morphemes:
it is regularly used in order to indicate that the situation described
by the given clause is a reaction to the actions of another participant, most often, to utterances or requests:(910)a. ibel’e-t

The situation just described can also be resumed in the next clauseby the combination of the connective adverb tat (see 7.1.2.2.4) and
the verb 1’e- ‘be’ (911a)-(911b) or, less frequently, @- ‘make’ (911c)or kude- ‘become’ (912).!0?",[546]
