6.3.1 Verb Final
As we have seen in preceeding sections, in Iau the verb with its associated particles always
occurs clause final as is re-illustrated in the following example.
A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷
se⁵.
1s book see-TOT.INC Inten
I am going to look at books.
In the Iau clause above, the verb follows the two nouns. The intention particle “se⁵” is part of the
verb phrase and functions as part of the clause periphery.
6.3.2 Nouns Ordered by Topicality
Nouns in Iau clauses are not ordered according to their grammatical function. That is, they can
occur in the order subject followed by object, or in the order object followed by subject. It is in
fact difficult in Iau to find criteria for labeling a noun as subject or object. The rule of thumb for
the ordering of nouns is as follows: if a noun is the topic of the clause, then it is placed at the
beginning of the clause to the left of other nouns. Other nouns are positioned from left to right in
order of topicality. The following set of sentences illustrate this.
1.A⁹ bv⁸ku⁷ doe⁷
e⁸
da⁹ki⁶ y⁴.
I book see-TOT.INC Nomin good
Info-SNC.NA.NDT
It would be good if I could look at books.
2.Bv⁸ku⁷ bv⁶ doe⁷
e⁸
da⁹ki⁶
y⁴.
book
1s see-TOT.INC Nomin good Info-SNC.NA.NDT
It would be good if I could look at the books.
In the first sentence the pronoun a⁹ `I' is topic of the clause and is also the fronted NP. In
example 2 books the undergoer is the topic of the clause
When three or more nouns occur in a clause, they are ordered on a sliding scale of topicality and
definiteness. The topical nouns are placed to the left of nontopical nouns. Definite nouns preceed
indefinite nouns. The question and answer set illustrate this.
1.Te⁸du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸
be⁸
da⁷ bv⁸ da⁸ tv³?
what
Benjamin Cause dog for carry leave- TOT.DUR
What was it that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for?
2.Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Be⁸a⁸bi⁸ be⁸ bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ tv⁹
cassowary that Benjamin
for dog carry leave-TOT.PUN
It was a cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
In each of the sentences above there are three participants involved in the action-Benjamin, the dog, and the animal being hunted. In the examples above, the ordering of
the particle bv⁸ and the noun da⁷ `dog' is reversed. In (1) bv⁸ ‘goal’ occurs after the noun
da⁷ and in (2) it occurs before `da⁷' dog.
The first sentence is a question which asks for the identity of the animal being hunted. The
particle `bv⁸' `for (it)' refers to some unknown animal. The noun `da⁷' on the other hand refers to
a specific animal known to the speaker and hearer. Since the noun da⁷ `dog' is definite and the
animal referred to by the particle bv `for (it)' is indefinite, the speaker places the indefinite
particle bv⁸ to the right of the more definite noun da⁷.
In sentence (2) however the identity of the animal hunted is specified as a cassowary. In (2), the
particle bv⁸ now refers to a definite noun, dai³ `cassowary', which is also the sentence topic as
indicated by its position to the far left of the sentence. Because bv⁸ refers to a noun that is both
definite and topical it must preceed the noun da⁷ which is definite but not topical.
The following sentence is another example of a topical noun preceeding a less topical noun.
Y⁸ da⁶ se⁸ko⁸da⁷ o⁷
da⁸dv⁹

we work-TOT.INC 1P-Imp
When we have finished school today, and when we have gone out (ie when school is
over) let's all go to work in the school teacher's garden.","[91, 92]"
"92The topic of this portion of the conversation is the teacher's garden. The speaker wants the
hearers to work on it after school. The sentence above consists of three clauses. The first two
clauses have only one participant, Y⁸ `we'. The final clause in the sentence has two participants
y⁸ `we' and a⁵ ku⁸du⁸ be⁸sy⁹ `the teacher's garden'. Since the noun phrase `the teachers garden' is
what the sentence is about, it must preceed the pronoun y⁸ `we'.
6.3.3 Order in focus- presupposition clauses.
As we have also seen above, focus presupposition clauses in the form of cleft constructions are
also common in Iau (It was the dog that…). In these kinds of sentences, the word order is
reversed. The new predicated information is placed on the left side of the clause, the already
given /known /topical information is placed to the right as shown below.
New Predicated Info
Topic/Given/Known
IO
Subj
Obj IO
Verb
Dai³ du⁷be⁷ Benyamin be-8 da⁷ bv⁸
da⁸ tv
-9?
cassowary it was that Benjamin PredInfo -Ag dog for carry go away -Tot.Punc
It was cassowary that Benjamin took the dog to hunt for.
In the example above the given known topical information is that someone took a dog out
hunting. The statement above identifies what they were hunting, the main new information and
who was the agent. The topical information is placed on the right, the new information is placed
on the left. The identity of the agent is known but important to be specified so it is placed in the
middle position, partially predicated but also known information.
6.5 Clauses, The Building Blocks Of Sentences.
Clauses are primarily the building blocks that form sentences. They can be embedded within
other clauses in noun slots as nominalized clauses in order to describe or identify participants in
terms of events. They can also form complex sentences by being embedded in temporal
adverbial slots in the form of dependent clauses. Or as independent with no embedded temporal
adverbial clauses, clauses can combine with each other in additive relationships to form
compound sentences. (See the section on sentence types below)
So, clauses in Iau can be classified into 4 types according how they are used in other sentences
and clauses. These four types are independent clauses, medial clauses, subordinate and
nominalized clauses. The following section of a narrative text consisting of one long sentence
(which is very common in Iau narrative) illustrates all four types of Iau clauses. In the example
below, nominalized clauses are on the far left margin, independent clauses next, medial verbs
next and subordinate clauses the most indented.

This happened once in the past when I was at (the place called) Fibefui. One evening I
was begging my mother for some sago. I was crying in front of her, but when my mother
didn’t give me any, I slept. (/I went to sleep without her giving me any). And then in the
night I woke up and then I secretly got up to get mother’s sago……
These four Iau clause types contrast in their distribution within sentences, permitted verb stem
tones, and in types of conjunctions. Each of these clause types will be illustrated and discussed
below.
6.3.1 Independent Clauses
Iau independent clauses are characterized by the following structural features. They allow the
full range of aspect tone morphemes on the verb and the full range of postverbal particles,
including the illocutionary force marking particles. Independent clauses in Iau are not marked by
an obligatory conjunction or clause marker. The following sentences illustrate these features.
A⁹ y⁷
bv⁸ i⁷
1 water for go-Tot.Inc
I am going to get water.a⁹
MUbd-FACTy⁹.
StatemtUi⁸
fi⁸
fe⁷be⁴ da⁸dv⁹
y⁸ bi⁸ sa³.
house
thatch bad
MVClCj
we rain eat-Tot.Dur
The roof thatch was bad and so, we got wet from the rain.
The first example above illustrates an independent clause with a clause final illocutionary force
statement marker ‘y’ and a preceeding status marker ‘a’. The sentence stress falls on the clause
final illocutionary force marker. The second example consists of two clauses. The second clause
in bold is the independent clause. The tone 3 aspect morpheme on the verb sa³ does not occur on
medial verb clauses but is allowed on verbs in independent clauses. Sentence stress is located on
the verb sa³ in the final independent clause.
The first example above also illustrates another factor which distinguishes independent clauses
from the other clause types in Iau. Independent clauses have a distinct grammatical function
from the other clause types. Independent clauses function as the nuclear components of
sentences. That is, an independent clause in itself can also be a simple sentence. The other clause
types by themselves do not form complete sentences but must occur in combination with an
independent clause.
6.3.2 Medial Verb Clauses
Medial verbs are a class of verbs characteristic of the non Austronesian languages of Papua,
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Medial verbs in these languages do not carry the full tense,
aspect, and mood information marked on independent verbs. They are frequently used to form
sentences with long strings of dependent clauses ending in a final independent clause. Many
languages with medial verbs are also characterized by switch reference marking systems in
which a marker on the medial verb indicates whether its subject is the same subject or a different
subject than the subject of the main clause or a subsequent clause. No evidence of this kind of
system has been found in Iau.
Medial verb clauses in Iau are also characterized by an obligatory 2 syllable clitic conjunction
which occurs clause final and marks dependent relationships such as temporal sequence, reason,
grounds, adversative, temporal margins, prerequisite events and chains of events as illustrated
below.","[92, 93, 94]"

Iau3 is a Papuan language spoken by over 1500 speakers who live along the Van Daalan River, a
southern branch of the Tariku /Rouffaer River in the Western Lakes Plains area. They are located
in the District of Fawi, Puncak Jaya Regency, Papua, Indonesia. (Ethnologue). GPS coordinates
for the main village of Fawi are: 03 13.86S 137 43.56EThe Lakes Plains Languages were originally grouped with the Tor languages to the northeast as
part of the Trans New Guinea Languages (Wurm 1982, Voorhoeve 1975), but more recently with
the Geelvink/Cenderawasih Bay Languages such as Bauzi, Tunggare, and Burate (Clouse,
1997), And by some as an independent family (Ross 2005, Usher ) (See also Wikipedia).
The Iau dialect trio of Iau, Turu, and Foi along with Edopi are classified by Usher (2018) as
West Tariku4 languages as opposed to the Wapoga River, Central and Duvle-East languages.
The Glottologue makes the Tariku (River) languages into a broader grouping, which includes
East Tariku, Central Tariku, Duvle and West Tariku. In this classification Iau and the other 2
dialecs are classed as Central Tariku. Iau is also classified as a Central Tariku lanugage in
Clouse’s classification of Tariku (1997) which consists of six families—Tause, West Tariku,
Central Tariku. East Tariku, Duvle and West Lakes Plains.","[1, 2, 3]"

The topic of the conversation above is the marital status of various individuals. Speaker 2's
statement marked by tone 4 is a reaction /response to the information in Speaker 1's statement.
However, Speaker 2's statement does not assert information about the discourse topic, ie the
marital status of a particular individual.
5.1.4 COMPOUND VERB PHRASES IN IAU
Iau has several subordinating particles which seem to be operating more on the phrase level than
the clause level. The particle se⁹ which is also a subordinate clause conjunction ‘since’ can also
be used to mark manner as illustrated below.

when used with a tone 7 also indicates an accompanying event which could also be marked as
purpose.

5.0 PHRASES
In this section we will look at verb phrases and noun phrases.
5.1 The Verb Phrase
For a more detailed discussion see Bateman, 1986 and Bateman, 1990 both in NUSA.
The verb occupies the nuclear /head slot in the verb phrase. Each verb and post-verbal particle
slot have an accompanying set of tone morphemes that can occur on the particles in that
grammatical slot. In Iau only the verb and its accomanying aspect tone are obligatory.
In the Iau verb phrase only the head /nuclear element, the verb, is obligatory. In narrative
discourse, post verbal particles are rare and highly marked. By contrast in dialogue, post verbal32particles marking epistemic, evidential and hearer-speaker dynamics are the norm. Each
discourse genre has it’s commonly occuring verb phrase forms. The pre-verbal constituents of
manner, directionals and locationals are found in all discourse types.
The following chart gives a list of slots in the verb phrase, the tone morpheme sets for each slot
and the required order for the slots.","[31, 32, 33]"
"The cassowary went up (the bank) again b. and Des shot him.
In example 1 above, the first pause is a secondary pause (ie a potential pause marked by a
slowing) and marks the following appositional noun phrase. The appositional noun phrase is
followed by the LPD1 primary pause.
In example 2 above, the temporal framework of the second clause is nominalized and placed in
the second LDP, making it contrastive to the temporal framework of the first clause. The
topicalization of a clause peripheral item may require the restatement of the first LPD topic
Example 3 occurs in the peak of a narrative eventline. One of the marking features of peak is the
use of pronouns for normally zeroed participants.

Zeroed Head Nouns With Descriptions In The Clause
When participants with full descriptive noun phrases are being activated in a discourse in the
LDP of a clause, the Head noun is placed in an LDP and NP is repeated as a clause constituent
with a zeroed head noun. This is illustrated in two examples below.
LPD
Dav²

And so, we have made the airstrip very long.
In the examples above, it looks like the descriptive adjectives and quantifiers modifying the LDP
Head are separated from it and placed in the clause core. But since Iau zeroes topic in subequent
sentences and clauses unless they are ambiguous, I think it is really a case of a full information
NP with a zeroed head that appears in the clause proper.
A Different Strategy For Additional Information About The Topic
Additional information about the noun in the LDP can also be stated in full noun phrases and as
appositional noun phrases within the LDP. The following are some examples.
LDP 1

We and someone from (a place) halfway to Turumo, (Ayhedi),
we ate breadfruit together.
In the example above LDP 1 is marked off by the usual spacer and topicalizes the narrator. The
next LDP (2) topicalizes a man who ate breadfruit with them. Eating and hunting are highly
emotive parts of a travelog. So this man is topicalized in an LDP. In order to give additional
information about his identity, the speaker by pauses and the use of the identity particle by⁷
blocks off a third LDP. The fourth LDP is used to bring the narrative back to the highest
topicalized participant and what the narrator wants to say about him, that they ate breadfruit
together.

This sentences is from the middle of the story, not the setting. While his brother is working, the
younger brother is trying to entertain himself, looking for sago grubs, and then wanting to set his
own pig trap. But the older brother vetoes everything he wants to do. So LPD 1 in the sentence
above is the beginning of his attempt to rebel and set his own trap any way. The old pig trap is
the important prop that enabled him to succeed, the point of the whole story how he triumphed
over his older brother. So that prop is introduced in an LDP with additional info about it given in
a second LDP. After that the third LDP, a lower level importance is followed by the clause
content.","[81, 82, 83]"
"DUBd-URLZa⁴.
DUBd URLZIn both sentences the relationship between fish and nets is the same. Nets are the means by which
the undergoer,`fish', is affected. The first sentence answers the question `What is used for
catching fish?' The second sentence answers the question `What are nets used for?'
The tone 7 variant be⁷ is used to mark nouns in clauses in which some other noun is the
predicated new information or it is used to mark nouns which are already partially known or
highly expected in the context. The following are some examples.

kill-TOT.DURThe be noun markers will be discussed in more detail in a separate section below.
The first example above is taken from a portion of a text that is about catching a pig. The
narrator is telling which body part each of the participants grabbed in order to catch the pig. The63fact that the participants grabbed onto a body part of the pig is highly expected in the context.
The be⁷ marker with a tone 7 marks the specific identity of the body part as highly expected. The
second example illustrates the use of a tone 7 on the be particle to mark a noun which is not the
new or unknown noun in the context. In (2) above, the hearer already knows that the speaker is
the one who killed the animal.
The particle di⁷ is used in Iau to mark a body part which is used as an instrument. The following
is an example.
Bo⁸de⁷

a⁷se⁹
e⁸ -di⁷

following sentence is an example.
Ui⁸
e⁸` -fe⁷
davy⁷
dy³.

Build a house for me.
The noun marker bv⁸ is used to indicate that the noun is the goal toward which an entity is
moving. The following are some examples.
1. A⁹ ui⁸
bv⁸ i⁹.
I house to go-TOT.PUN
I am going to the house.
2. A⁹ du⁹
bv⁸ da⁷ da⁸ i⁹.
I wild pig for dog carry
go-TOT.PUN
I took my dog hunting for wild pigs.
In the first example, bv⁸ marks the location toward which the moving object is moving. In the
second example bv⁸ marks the goal of the action, ie what the hunter is going to get.
The particle bv⁸ occurs alone without an associated noun when it refers back to the sentence
topic. The following is an example where the particle bv⁸ refers back to du⁹ `wild pig', the
sentence topic.

The particle fi⁵ is used in Iau to mark a noun that was formerly the location or possessor of an
object, but another participant took it away from him. The particle fi⁵ marks an undergoer source.

below.
5.2.2 Specialized Noun Phrases

"85In Iau topic comment clauses, there is a special marking structure for discourse contexts in which
a noun rather than the verb becomes the primary information which is being asserted about the
topic as illustrated below.

In the example above, in the second sentence the dog is established as topic and the verb
‘killed’is the focus –the information being asserted/predicated about the dog. But in the
following sentences the new information being asserted shifts from the verb to the identity of the
agent. The clause structure however has not changed. The focus shift from verb to noun is
marked by the be particle on the noun indicating that it is focus head.
Topic-comment structure is the normal unmarked clause structure in Iau . Topical nouns are
placed to the left in order of degree of topicality.

As illustrated above, the modality post-verbal particles have intention, desiderative and
inabilitative meanings. The tones that occur on these particles, have status meanings. Status
deals with the reality or factuality of the situation. .

Nouns and obligation modals preceed the clause nucleus in Iau. Each will be discussed below.
Core Nouns.
The following are some examples of nouns in the Iau clause core. The nouns are in bold.

16. Au⁷
tv⁹ e⁹ ti⁴ to⁹.
he
sago me give CntraExpct
But he gave me sago! /or Contrary to what you think, he gave me
sago!
As illustrated above, Iau is an verb final language, The nouns in the clause core preceed the
clause nucleus. Examples 14 and 15 also show that ordering of nouns in the clause is not
determined by semantic role. In example 14 the order of the nouns is Agent followed by
Undergoer. In example 15, the order is Undergoer followed by agent. In example 14, the agent `I'
is also the clause topic, or what the clause is about (Dik 1978). But in example 15, the undergoer,
`sago' is the clause topic.
Examples 14 and 15 illustrate that ordering of nouns in Iau clauses is pragmatically determined.
Regarding the ordering of NP’s, the more topical nouns are placed to the left of less topical
nouns.
Examples 14 and 15 differ in another way. In 14, the unmarked pronoun form a⁹ for first person
singular is used. In 15, when 1st person singular agent is not clause topic, the marked pronoun
form bv⁶ is used. This illustrates that the unmarked expectation in an Iau clause is that agent will
also be topic. If not, and if the agent is first person singular pronoun, it must be marked as nontopical agent. None of the other pronouns have a separate form for non-topical agent.
As also illustrated above, Iau nouns and pronouns are normally unmarked for semantic role.
Under certain discourse conditions, nouns in Iau are marked for semantic case roles. This will be
discussed in Section *.
Iau is a pro-drop language with no verb agreement. The following portion of a procedural text
(See 3.7 for full text), illustrates the pro-drop phenomena in Iau. The clauses illustrating prodrop
are in bold in the text.

then, g. the canoe tree falls to the ground. When it has fallen to
the ground, h. the person goes over to it. When he has gets to it,
i. he cuts off the top of the tree. When he has cut off the top of
the tree, j. he goes home. He goes home and then, k. he eats.
Exceptions to this will be discussed in a section on participant reference.(Section not yet
written)
The Obligation Modals, Clause Core or Periphery?
The root modal, obligation, is listed by Van Valin (1993) as a core operator. The following are
some examples of what happens in Iau clause structure when the obligation modals are present.

ProbableWhen these modality markers occur in an Iau clause, they act as `spacers', separating the most
topical noun from the other nouns in the clause, and forming a left dislocated position (LDP).
Spacers are defined as `pause-like' elements whose position indicates discontinuity in the
information structure of the utterance. (Dooley 1990.477-478)
The position of pause relative to the LDP and the spacer in the Iau clause varies as is illustrated
below.

Multisyllabic words carry stress.
Stress on indigenous Iau dissyllabic words falls on the final syllable.

sa⁶i⁸ clothes (leaf-skin?)
i⁶su³ hair (head-hair)V-V
CV-V
V-CVAs stated above, most Iau two syllable words are morphologically complex. Shoes is actually
foot-skin. Shoes are viewed as a kind of skin covering. It is the pragmatically (in this case also
semantic) nuclear syllable meaning skin that get the stress. The modifier -foot, is unstressed. It is
the same for i⁶su³, head hair. The word su means fur, hair, or feathers. The hair on our heads is a
type of hair. The modifier ‘head’ describes which kind of hair is being referred to. The syllable
meaning ‘hair’ is stressed and the modifier unstressed.
Stress on loan words from Indonesian keep the stress pattern of Indonesian which have stress on
the next to last syllable.

Stress placement is not only pragmatically determined on the word level, but also on higher
levels eg, word, phrase, clause etc. Stress on lower levels (such as word or phrase) is placed on
the word or syllable that is the pragmatic nucleus of the phrase. The sentence below consisting
of a noun phrase and a verb phrase illustrates this. The words in bold are stressed and have at
least twice the lenth of the syllables in italic. The syllables in italic in turn have twice the length
of the syllables in regular type

carry-go ImperativeIn the case of higher level structures (such as clause or sentence) extra stress is placed on the
semantic unit that is focus /comment in the clause or sentence.
2.5 Words
Words are the smallest units of speech that can be spoken with meaning in isolation. They are
potentially bounded by pause, and can written bounded by a space. Words in Iau like other
languages are of 5 basic types, nouns (people, places, things, or names), verbs, adverbs,
adjectives, and free standing grammatical particles or markings indicating relationships of
grammatical units with each other.
2.5.1 Phonological Characteristics of Words
As noted at the beginning of this section, words in Iau are identified by potential pause
preceeding or following the word. Words in Iau are mostly monosyllabic with some two syllable
words and a few three syllable words.
Most monosyllablic words (V,VV. VVV. CV, CVV, CVVV, or CVC /VC) are indigenous Iau
words. As nouns, adjectives, adverbs they are single morphemes. But as verbs and sometimes
particles, they are morphemically complex as we shall see below.
2.5.2 Grammatical Characteristics of Words
Iau nouns are unmarked grammatically, or pragmatically.They occur in the beginning and middle
parts of the sentence. They are optionally marked for pragmatic and semantic roles by the be
particle.
Iau adjective are optionally marked for their pragmatic role in defining which item of several
options is being dicussed. They are also marked by the focus particle be⁷ with a tone 7.
Iau adverbs can be marked in some cases also by the particle be with a tone 492.5.3 Multisyllabic Words
Multisyllabic words are often loan words from Indonesian or morphemically complex.. These
two types differ in stress patterns. Indigenous Iau multi morpheme, multisyllable words have
word final stress. This is because stress is pragmatically determined. Stress marks the nuclear
component of the grammatical unit and is manifested by length.
3.0 MORPHEMES AND MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDS
In this section we will discuss morphologically complex words in Iau. We will mainly discuss
verb roots, stems and words as well as nouns and the clitics /affixes(?)
3.1 Verb Roots Stems And Words
3.1.1 Phonological Structure
Iau verbs, even the monosyllabic ones, are morphologically complex structures. A verb stem in
it’s most minimal form consists of a vowel and a tone, but most have a consonant onset. And the
vowel cluster can have up to three vowels. A verb stem may have a single tone or a cluster of
tones. The eight basic tone morphemes, each a composite of 2 different aspectual viewpoints, are
discussed in Bateman, 1986 ‘The tone morphemes and aspect in Iau.’ How the tone meanings
interact with the segmental roots and stems will be discussed in a separate section below. (See
Pawley 1987, 2006 for a non tonal language with complex predicates.)
The following are some examples of Iau verbs consisting only of a vowel root and a tone.

are allowed in complex nuclei in Iau.
3.1.2 Iau Segmental Verb Roots
In an article about Kalam, a Papuan language with a closed set of 90 verbs, Pawley (1987:336338) says these 90 verbs are composed of fewer than 30 verb roots, all having very broad or
abstract meanings. These verb roots are strung together in serial verb constructions to comprise
90% of all verbs occuring in Kalam texts. In Kalam, these strings of generic verbs are used to
indicate lexically complex events such as `hunt', `carry', `send to jail'. There are also many
ongoing studies in Southeast Asia concerning the phenomena7 of “complex verbs”, light or
vector verbs, serial verbs etc.
In Iau, monosyllabic segmental verb stems likewise seem to be composed of strings of consonant
and vowel root morphemes which combine to form stems with broad abstract meanings that are
furthur defined from context, from number of arguments for the predicate in the context, and also
by the aspect of the super-imposed aspect tone morphemes. This is illustrated by Iau verbs
formed with the consonant “b”below.
‘b’ Motion towards and reaching /acting on a goal /location
Some of the Iau verbs built from the root“b” +vowel
ba³ to come (process); to shoot, kill, throw at (a rock at someone)
ba⁹ come
be⁹ to paint
bi³ to arrive
baui³ to arrive at /reach
ba⁶ to come to
da⁸ba⁶ to bring to
bai⁶ beach /dock a canoe
bae⁵(sun /light) shine in on
bu⁵ burn down
bui⁵ cut down (tree)
bo⁵ act of moving to a sitting /squatting position on the ground
boe⁵to lower into a hole, to lower to the ground
Although the individual lexical definitions of these verbs beginning with the consonant ‘b’ vary
widely, note that they all share common spatial and directional motion orientation between the
participants and the action. All the “b” verbs listed above have to do with motion towards a goal
location which results in contact or action on/at that goal-location. The vowels mark various
viewpoints of this action.
For example, in the list above, the verbs be⁹ and ba⁹ /ba³ /ba⁶ all involve a locative relationship
between an object and a goal location, but the vowel ‘e’ has stative qualities. To paint something
involves permanently locating and coating the goal location with the paint. The vowel ‘a’ has a
more generic motion viewpoint, to locate at a place. Both “ba⁹’ and ‘ba³’ involve a moving
object moving towards a goal and locating there. The verb “bi³” is an action that stresses
accomplishment, the total completion of the motion. To have arrived focuses on the completion
of the action of moving towards a goal reaching it and being there. The verb “baui³” to reach a
location is used in travel logs to indicate an intermediate or endpoint goal achieved. The focus is
more on the process of struggle or motion ending in achievement of an intermediate goal to
come/get as far as that location, implying a goal beyond that one, or in some contexts a barely
achieved goal.
The verb ‘ba⁶’ marked with a resultative aspect tone 6 means ‘to have come to’. This is
illustrated more clearly in the compound verb ‘da⁸ba⁶’ to bring s. to a location. The addition of
the more effective action completive viewpoint vowel “i”, forming the verb bai⁶ in a context
where a person is travelling in a canoe, gives the meaning ‘to beach or dock a canoe’ meaning to
Note to myself --See the Rice University (Houston Tx) ‘Eleventh Biennial Symposium:
Intertheoretical Approaches to Complex Verb Constructions’ for many interesting papers on this
topic to apply to Iau at some later date and investigate this topic more thoroughly.)
711put it to shore and tie it up there or to run it aground on the beach. “Bai³ ba⁹” means the sun
comes up. But “Bai³ bae⁵” means the sunshine locates or comes onto something, that is, it shines
in on something.
The list above illustrates how the meaning of the consonants and the vowel(s) interact with the
context and the tone morphemes to indicate which specific meaning should be assigned to the
verb. For example, the verb ba³, ‘to move towards a goal and locate there’ in the context of
hunting or fighting with weapons, means to shoot at and hit something, to kill it. In other
contexts it can mean just to hit as in throwing a rock and hitting the target. However in a more
intransitive context with only a moving object and a location, ‘ba³’ can mean to come (durative
process) as opposed to “ba⁹” come (totality of action, punctual).
The verb ‘bu⁵’ means to burn down. It is a highly effective transitive action, with the agent
totally affecting the undergoer. With the addition of the completive action morpheme “i” and a
telic aspect tone 5, the verb bui⁵ means to cut down /fell a tree. That, is the tree is caused to fall
to the ground/move towards its inevitable and final action endpoint. This is a motion in which
the totally affected undergoer moves to and contacts the goal location, the ground.
The verb ‘bo⁵’ refers to the act of sitting down -usually on the ground or the floor or often in a
squatting position. The person lowers his backside to the floor. (The verb for being seated is a
different verb “b” verb bau⁴de⁹ –a stative verb.) The verb “boe⁵” means to lower something into
a hole, or down to the ground, or to hold out something for someone to see, to demonstrate.
The following charts show the general meanings of Iau consonant and vowel verb roots that
combine to form Iau verb stems.

The monosyllabic consonant and vowel verb roots listed above encode general spatial,
locational, directional and relational viewpoints, static vs dynamic viewpoints and transitivity
viewpoints. As indicated in the list above, most of the vowel roots occur in isolation as verbs.
But consonant roots, of course, do not occur in isolation.
3.1.2.3 Vowel Root Meanings Of The Second Or Third Vowels In The Verb StemWe have seen in section 2.3 on Iau syllable structure that Iau syllable muclei can consist of one,
two or three vowels (V, VV, VVV)
In verb stems with vowel clusters VV or VVV, the second or third vowel marks transitivity, that
is, the degree of effectiveness, the degree of completion of the action, or some limitation on the
action or affectedness of the undergoer
“e” =cause become, become;
“i” indicates totally do the action, effective action;
“y” has to do with a boundary or limitation at a location
“u” indicates action against the undergoer, down on the undergoer location

The verb roots combine to form segmental verb stems. As we have seen above, each verb stem
has a general abstract meaning which is a combination of the meanings of the consonant and
vowel roots of which it is composed. This is illustrated again by the chart below of some of the
“b” verb stems.

8.2.2 Tone Sequences
In addition to the eight basic levels and contours, there are 4 combinations of 2 tone sequences
that commonly occur on single syllables, The sequences ⁷⁻⁸ and ⁴⁻⁷ are the most common
sequences on verbs, adjectives and particles. The following are some examples.
da⁸⁻⁴ mountain.
sae⁶⁻⁴ machete
Baui⁷⁻⁸(be⁷) three (Note ⁷⁻⁸ is a tonal variant of ⁷⁻³.)
bui⁴⁻⁷ (se⁵) will cut down (intention marking particle)
The ⁴⁻⁷ sequence which occurs on telic verbs when combined with an intention indicating particle
is very common and easily elicited.
Au⁷ u⁸ bui⁴⁻⁷ se⁵
He is going/intending to cut down a tree
The ⁷⁻⁸ sequences occurs on particles, adjectives and verbs except in certain rare occurances on
some verbs, it can also be easily elicited.
Baui⁷⁻⁸(be⁷) three

later child boy give-birth-to
And so his wife later gave birth to a boy child.
Y⁸ su⁴ fe⁷⁻⁸
we die lest/might
We might die./Lest we die (contradesiderative)
There are other tone sequences that occasionally show up on verbs expressing aspectual nuances
that are extremely contextual and speaker perspective oriented. These occur in natural text but
are difficult to elicit.
Sui -3
to die (process change of state), Lit. enter into (the world of the dead). (⁹⁻⁸ ⁶⁻⁸
and ⁶⁻⁴ tone substitution morphemes in subordinate and linking clauses)
baui⁸⁻⁵ to finally reach ones destination. (⁸⁻⁴ tone substitution morpheme in linking
dependent clauses)
bv⁸ ba⁶⁻³ to come to/arrive at (⁶⁻⁸ and ⁶⁻⁴ tone substitution morphemes in subordinate and
linking clauses)72.3 Syllable Structure
Iau is basically a monosyllabic language. The syllable structure allows complex syllable nuclei
of up to 3 vowels. There are no consonant clusters and only one type of closed syllable ending in
an unreleased [p]with very limited distribution.

The eight Iau vowels a,i,i-,y,e,u,v,o are distributed in VV complex vowel nuclei as follows:
V1V²ai-iyeuvai-aiayaeauavuuivvyooeNote that in the first vowel slot of VV nuclei, only a, and one of the back vowels u, v and o
occur. In the second vowel slot i-, i, y, e occur. The back vowel u and v also occurThe vowels a
and o do not occur as V².
There are only two types of VVV nuclei allowed, the sequence aui and the sequence avy as
shown below.

Spkr 2: I'm going to use them to kill fish.
In the first example above, the speaker is refuting the basic underlying assumption that the
woman in question is married. The second example illustrates the use of the particle ‘to’ to
emphasize that Speaker 2's own experience in using goggles to catch fish is contrary to Speaker
1's who has never used them.
The particle ‘e’ is more rare than the other mood particles in conversational discourse. The ‘e’
particle is used on statements that the hearer is using to justify or explain his action. The
following segment of conversational discourse illustrates this.

The final sentence marked by the particle ‘e’ functions in the discourse context to give
information explaining why Speaker 1 came to Speaker 2 to ask him about corne.
Mood Particles Eliciting a Response from the Hearer.
There are 7 segmental mood particles which mark propositions which the speaker is using to
elicit a response from the hearer. They are listed below. Syllables with tone variants do not have
a tone on them in the list below
be/ba (Unstressed) Yes-No Question Marker (?Mkr)
asy Directs the hearer's attention to something (Attn)
bv Request permission /instruction /action (Rq)
dy Imperative (Imp)
dy⁴da Emphatic /Repeated Imperative (EImp)

The unstressed be/ba marker is used to mark yes-no questions in which the speaker is trying to
elicit certain information as a response from the hearer. The following is an example.
Fv⁷ da⁸su⁶
ba⁷
ba³?
plane tomorrow come-TOT.INC ?Mkr-RS.SA

The particle asy which occurs with several tone variations, is used to direct the speaker's
attention to something. The following sentence is an example.
Dai⁸dv⁹ doe⁷
a⁹sy⁹.
butterfly see-TOT.INC Attn-NRS.SA
Look at the butterflies!
The asy particle not only calls the speaker`s attention to something but also has the connotation
that the speaker anticipates it is highly relevant or of interest to the hearer.
The bv particle marks requests for permission and also requests for the hearer to instruct the
speaker on what the hearer wants the speaker to do. The bv particle is illustrated below.

The `where' question words illustrated above are the words used when the speaker wants the
hearer to inform him of the location of something.
The following sentences illustrate the use of the question word te⁸be⁷ `where' to ask for the
source location of something.
1.Di⁹ a⁵ te⁸be⁷ o⁸sy⁹ de⁷?
2s land where from Stat
Where do you come from?
2.Di⁹ te⁸be⁷ bi³?

The `where' question words te⁸ and te⁸be⁷ in Iau are not used in Iau in situations where the
speaker is using location to identify which of several objects is being discussed. These are
discussed in the following section on which question words.
9.1.4 Which Questions
`Which' questions are asked when the speaker has a choice of several items. The speaker uses a
`which' question word to get information about the identifying characteristics or the identifying
location of the item. `Which' questions in Iau are marked by the question words te⁸bai⁵,
tebai⁵de⁸dv⁷ or te⁸be⁸de⁷. The following are some examples of `which' questions in Iau.

Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³.

Who is it that has arrived?
The first question above is a yes-no question. A speaker asks a yes-no question to find out if the
information in the question is true or not. When the speaker asks a yes-no question, he wants the
hearer to confirm or deny the information in the question. In the example above, the speaker is
not sure whether the the plane is coming or not.
The second question above is an example of a content question. Content questions are who,
what, when, where, why, how questions. The speaker asks a content question when he doesn't
know some specific bit of information in the sentence. In the Iau content question in (2) above,
the speaker doesn't know the identity of the subject so he asks the hearer,""Who is it that arrived?""
The question word `who' is underlined in example (2) above. Each of the two kinds of questions
in Iau will be discussed in detail in the following sections.","[109, 110]"

9.2 Commands In Iau
Commands are one of a class of utterances used to get the hearer to do something for the
speaker. Requests, wishes, desires, suggestions, and prohibitions are examples of other kinds of
utterances that are used to express what the speaker wants the hearer to do in a less direct way
(mitigated commands). These utterances all differ in the degree of obligation that the speaker
places on the hearer. Iau has several different kinds of particles and tone morphemes that are
used to express varying degrees of obligation. Each of the different types of commands will be
discussed and illustrated individually below.
9.1 Simple Commands
A simple command in Iau is formed by adding the command particle dy³ following the verb and
by changing the verb stem tone. The following command is an example.
1.I⁷
dy³.
go-TOT.INC Imp-SA.RS
Go!
The verb i⁹ `to go' usually has a tone 9 on it. In commands, just like yes-no questions, the tone 9
is changed to a tone 7. Tone 7 means that the action is either incomplete or that it has not
happened yet. Tone 5 verbs change to a tone 4 and tone 3 verbs change to a tone 8. These tone
changes are illustrated in the commands below.
1.Au⁷ foi⁴

depending on the grammatical functions of the particles. This can be illustrated by the following
list of word types using the segmental “be”. All possible meanings of the monosyllable ‘be’, are
listed below. The particle ‘be’ is one of the most productive monosyllables in the language.

As illustrated above in the final sentence, the words davy⁷ ‘far away’ and foe⁴⁻⁷ ‘close up’ are
being contrasted as two different positions from which to shoot a pig. In the speakers opinion,
older and bigger people are less quick and nimble but also stronger, so it is safer and possible for
them to stay farther away and still have chance of shooting a wild pig. In this case the two
adverbs are the predicated information, that is what the speaker wishes to say about shooting
pigs.

The postpostition ta⁷ normally has a tone 7 on it and fills the postpostion slot noun phrase final.
However, when the noun phrase is part of a clause with a stative locative verb, the postpostion
ta⁷ changes to ta⁹. And ta⁹ becomes a clitic attached to a verb or adverb.

The first example above shows the postposition ta⁷ in it’s unmarked distribution. In the second
clause in the example above. The postposition ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is a clitic attached to the verb30and means ‘live in’ Note in the first clause above that the postpostion ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is
attached as a clitic to the directional adverb bi² and means ‘up inside’.

Tones Viewing The Propostion As Progressing Towards Realization (3,8,2)
Tone 3
Tone 3 views the proposition as progressing towards realization at some time. It can mean ‘has
been /has done’, ‘do, or be doing’.

The question above is not about the past but about who currently is in the habit of making mats,
or who is currently using the stick. Perhaps the speaker want to order one. The speaker receives
the answer that the Dani people have and still are making these mats.
The di particle refers to a definite punctual viewpoint event. The tone 3 morpheme means the
action has been realized. This is a commonly used stem to mean that an action has already been
done /completed.

Evidential particles in the Iau verb phrase evaluate the truth properties of the proposition they
mark and also the information source, marking what is commonly known or given information.

sentences. Da, bede, fi, da⁷by³, di⁷dv³,

Epistemic Tone Morphemes
The set of epistemic tone morphemes in Iau view the temporal and realis occurrence conditions
of the verbal situation and evaluate it according to degrees of factiveness or realization. They
also comment on the temporal characteristics of that reality, These same status morphemes occur
on stative, negative, modality, status and evidential particles.
T2 Meanings of Status Tone Morphemes on Iau .
Tones Establishing A Proposition As Fact (9,5,6)
Tones 9, 6 and 5 establish the proposition as fact.They vary in terms of when that proposition is
being viewed as fact. Tone 9 is by far the most common FACT establishing tone on the Iau postverbal particles. Tone 5 is next because it occurs so frequently on intention statements.
Tone 9
Tone 9 is inherently totality of the action /proposition and punctual viewpoint. So it views the
situation as a fact at some time (past, present, future, or hypothetical) in order to comment on it.
The following examples of tone 9 on the particles di, be and se illustrate the use of the epistemic45modality tone morphemes to assert or establish a proposition as a fact at some time in the
discourse.

making knives was in the past.
The following is an example of tone 9 on a negative:

The sentence about is a yes no question where the assumed answer is “No”. The negative
proposition “you do not eat corn” is viewed as fact by the speaker, as indicated by the tone 9
marking on the negative. The yes-no question particle gives the person the option of refuting or
clarifying the assumed fact.
Tone 9 can also occur on unbounded habitual or general truth statements

Case Marking Particles
The final particles in the Iau noun phrase are the optional particles which mark the case role of
the noun relative to discourse topic.The also mark the information in the noun phrase as
predicated information. For more information on predicated information see section 6.2 below
about pragmatic focus –presupposition and the Iau clause.
The following is a list of the focus/case marking particles in Iau.
be⁷ /be⁴ /be⁸marks noun phrase as predicated information about the case role of noun relative
to discourse topic
by⁷ same as be⁷ but refers to a specific item or individual known to the hearer
di⁷ body part as instrument
fe⁷ /fa⁷ benefactive
bv⁸ goal (for, to)
fi⁵ undergoer source (take away from)62The noun markers be and by are used to mark noun phrases when the noun phrase is part of the
new information that is being predicated about the topic. This is illustrated by the following
question and answer set.
Kaf⁷ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸

di³.
make-TOT.INC PBd-RLZIn the question and answer set above, the speaker and hearer are talking about a topic, a bow that
someone made. The new information that the questioner wants to know is: who made the bow. In
the example above the question word `who' and the name `Das' are both marked with the same
noun marker be⁸ to indicate that this noun and not the verb is the new information that is being
predicated about the topic, the bow.
The tone on these particles indicates the case role of the noun. The be and by noun markers have
three tone variants. The tone 8 variant be⁸ indicates that the marked noun is the causative agent
that acted on the topic noun. In the previous example Das was the one who acted on the bow and
made it. This is indicated by the tone 8 on the be⁸ case marker. The following sentence is an
another example.

Someone had already taken the news before (we got there) and so they had all already

The sentence above is answering the question `So you didn't actually kill any one on the raid?'
The answer is “No”. The reason is because of the news that had been carried to the people ahead
of time. The noun bi⁸ `news' is marked by the be⁸ particle as the cause of conversation topic, the
fact that they did not kill anyone.
When a tone 4 occurs on the topic case marker be⁴, it indicates that the noun is either acted on
by the topic or the noun is the instrument or means of acting on the topic. This is illustrated by
the following examples:

Iau was classified by Voorhoeve (1975) as a Papuan language in the New Guinea Phylum and
Tor-Lakes Plains Stock. It was later classfied by Duane Clouse (1997) as a member of the
Geelvink Bay Phylum, the Lakes Plains Superstock and the Western Tariku Family. See also
Wurm and Malcom Ross (2005). In Clouse’s classification of the Turu family there are three
dialects, Iau, Turu and Foi. The other member of this family is Edopi. The Western Tariku
languages are Fayu and Kiri-Kiri. He classifies Tause which is also spoken in the Western Lakes
Plains as a separate family.
1.2 Language Characteristics .
Iau is a tonal language. Tone is both lexical and morphemic. In the Iau phoneme inventory, there
are 6 consonants, 8 vowels and 8 phonemic tones. There are no phonemic nasals. But there are is
nasal allophone of the vowel /a/ and nasal allophones of some of the voiced stops. Iau, like other
Lakes Plain languages has a high front vowel that is fricativized and implosive voiced stops.
(Bateman, 1990)
Iau is a verb final language. It has a left dislocated positions for topics at both clause and
sentence level. It has an extensive system for marking non verbal items as predicated new
information in the clause. These are used to introduce or confirm, or give identifying
information concerning participants, locations, time and other setting type information. Like
other Papuan languages, a characterisic feature especially in narrative discourse structure is the
use of repeated linking clauses (Bateman, 2020)

Who questions are used when the normal focus item in the clause, the event, is known, but the
identity of the actor or agent for that event is unknown. The question word becomes the new
focus information about the topic, the rest of the clause.
There are two main `who' compound question words in Iau.
ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴
who? person identity marker
ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
who? agent as focus/new unknown information
The word ‘boe⁴’ (identity marker) used in the example below is in a topic as predicate focus
type sentence where the new predicated information is on the left side of the clause and marked
by ‘du⁷be⁷’.
Ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ du⁷be⁷ bi³?

who ID Mkr that w.pig-by bitten Epi Iden Mkr that w.pig-by bitten
It was Epi who was bitten by a wild pig.
The question word with the boe⁴ identity particle can also be used when the `who' question word
occurs in the normal predicate position as illustrated below.
Ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ boe⁴?
this who
ID mkr
Who is this?
A⁹ boe⁴ y³.
I Iden Mkr Statement Mkr
It's me.
As indicated above, the question word ty⁷⁻⁸boe⁴ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ `who' and the
identity marker boe⁴. The particle boe⁴ is used to mark statements of personal identity. The use of
the personal identity marker boe is also used to mark the identity information in the answers to
the questions in the illustrations above.
The question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸ consists of the question word ty⁷⁻⁸ and the noun marker be⁸. Be⁸
marks nouns or noun phrases within the clause when they are focus, predicated information. The
tone morpheme 8 marks them as causative agent The following is an example of the use of the
content question word ty⁷⁻⁸be⁸.
Da⁷ ba⁷bv⁹ ty⁷⁻⁸ be⁸
di³?
This dog, who NMkFocus/Ag killed (it)?
Who killed this dog?
In the question above the question word `who' uses the noun marker be⁸ because the person the
speaker wants to know about is also the one who brought about the action. That is the speaker
wants to know who acted on the dog and brought about his death.
9.1.2 What Questions
The four what question words in Iau are listed below.
te⁸de⁹ what? (predicate form)
te⁸du⁷ what thing?
/te⁸du⁷be⁷
te⁸be⁸de⁷ what kind of? (from where?,
which place?)
te⁸ (o⁷su⁹) de⁹ what kind of (leaf)?
te⁸ (bi⁸) du⁸ what kind of (news)? (Content)
The question te⁸de⁹ is the predicate form of the `what' question word in Iau. It consists of the
question word te⁸ `what' and the stative particle de⁹. The following question and answer set
illustrates the use of the question word te⁸de⁹.

viewpoints.

""The people now coming in a motor boat."" ""Which people is it that are coming back here?"" ""It's
the people that just recently went away to Do that are coming /arriving, of course.""
The punctual telic tone morpheme views the event of coming to a location as the completion of a
cycle so to speak. It can be glossed as come back/return, come back to one’s starting point. In
other contexts like the slow small oozing of blood from a wound, the blood comes out but stays
in that spot.
In the telic verb ‘come’ the endpoint location of the event come is fixed Also it is the same as the
beginning point. The telic durative aspect of come is glossed as attach to /adhere to.
The aspect tones illustrated above are made up of both lexical and grammatical aspect
parameters.The three aspectual viewpoints that heavily influence lexical meaning of the verb as
well as indicating degree of transitivity of the action represented by the verb stem are located
along the left side of the chart below.These are the totality of action, resultative, and telic
viewpoints. These will be discussed under lexical aspect below. The three grammatical aspectual
viewpoints in Iau are located across the top of the chart below. These are perfective/punctual,
imperfective /durative, and incompletive. The grammatical viewpoints will be discussed in
3.1.3.2 below.
PunctualDurativeIncompletiveTotality Of Action⁹³⁷Resultative⁶⁸Telic⁵²⁴3.1.3.1 Lexical Aspect And The Iau Tone Morphemes17Verbs are about events. There are inherently different types of events in the world. Some events
like boil /bring to a boil, or the rising and setting of the sun are inherent processes. Some like the
verb “run” inherently continue over time. Some events are processes with inherent endpoints,
like a tree falling to the ground. Some events like go, or come, are spoken of and viewed in their
totality, without focussing on any one part of the event. In many languages this information is
mostly implicit in the lexical meaning of the verb. In Iau, however, much of this type of
information is not indicated by the lexical form of the verb but by a combination of context and
tone morpheme aspect.
The chart below gives various examples of sets of verbs having the same segmental stem and
different lexical meanings..

In each of the examples above, the noun phrase or noun phrases in bold give additional
information about the identity of the noun in the first noun phrase.
5.2.3 Distribution of Iau noun phrases in the clause and sentence
The chart at the beginning of this sectio, laid out so neat and orderly, can be misleading. When I
first started studying Iau and encountered sentences like the one below, I starting thinking Iau
had “split” noun phrases.
Du⁹
a⁷se⁹
bo⁴be⁷ v³
fe⁶.
wild pig SeqMkr two-adj coming-to-ref. pt appeared
Wild pigs,( introduce ptrc/Mrk Chron Seq) two (of them) came into view/appeared.
The head noun and it’s descriptive quantifier are separated by what Dooley9 calls a “spacer
particle” This is a clause level particle that separates a left located topic slot from the clause
proper. What looks like a split noun phrase is the head noun, being marked as clause or sentence
topic. Then this head noun, having been already unambiguously mentioned as topic, is zeroed in
the clause proper. Only the modifying adjective occurs marking the noun phrase location in the
clause. The spacer particle slot will be discussed furthur in the section 6 on layered clauses and
is also pertinent to narrative discourse study because a⁷se⁹ marks participants as thematic and is
often used in narrative settings. It also functions to mark the events predicated in the clause as

5.2.4 Joining Nouns in Iau
Two or more nouns in Iau can be joined either directly by juxtaposition, or by use of one of the
three Iau noun conjunctions, bv⁸ke⁷ `also', be⁷⁻⁸de³ `and' (Complete list), and da⁸ba³ /da⁷ba³
`and' (Representative list). The following are some examples.
1.Fe⁸te⁸dus⁴ Kaui⁸be⁴sa³ ba⁷bv⁹

Example (1) above illustrates two nouns joined without a conjunction. Examples (2) through (4)
illustrate the use of each of the three noun conjunctions in Iau. The conjunctions follow the noun
they mark indicating that it is joined to another noun in the context. In the examples above, each
noun in the list of conjoined nouns is marked with a conjunction. However, it is not obligatory in
I don’t have any references available in my current location. Look up later. I got this through Northa Dakota SIL
one summer when Dooley was lecturing and also helping with my papers.

Some may be marked and others unmarked.
5.2.5 DISCOURSE: The Significance Of Noun Conjunctions In Iau Discourse
The choice of noun conjunction and the choice of whether a noun is marked by a conjunction at
all is determined by the relationships of the participants to the action and to each other in
performing the action. In general, nouns are simply juxtaposed and not marked by a conjunction,
when both nouns are participants that are major participants in the action and the discourse
context. The following example is the first sentence of an Iau short story which introduces the
participants as major participants using juxtaposed nouns. Note that since the speaker as
participant is obvious, being implicitly included in “we”, he does not mention himself again –
only the two other unintroduced participants.
Y⁸ baui⁷⁻⁸ A⁸de⁸a⁸ Ye⁷bi⁹ y⁸
we three
Adea Jimmy we
We three, Adea and Jimmy, we ...
Nouns that are all marked by conjunctions are usually not major participants or props in the
discourse and do not participate equally in the action. The following is an example.
Kaf⁷
bowbe⁷⁻⁸de³ si⁷
be⁷⁻⁸de³ da⁷ be⁷⁻⁸de³
and
net bag and
dog anda⁷se⁹
o⁹
Seq Mkr
take-TOT.PUN
He got his bow, string bag and dog.
The example above is from a portion of narrative in which the man is going to have to flee from
the village since he just murdered someone. The items marked by the conjunction be⁷⁻⁸de³ in the
example above have no major role in the narrative. They represent the usual things that a man
takes with him when he goes leaves the village for a jungle stay
When one noun is marked by a conjunction and the other is not, the unmarked noun has the
major role in the performance of the action or is the more topical participant in the narrative. The
following is an example.
A⁹ a⁷se⁹
Ti⁸bo⁸ti⁷vs³ bv⁸ke⁷ be³ta⁹ du³.
I SeqMkr Timotius
also
village walk -TOT.DUR
I was walking around the village with Timotius.
The example above is the opening line of an Iau short story. The story is about how the speaker
tricked Timotius as they were walking around the village. Timotius is marked by the noun
conjunction bv⁸ke⁷ as a less topical participant.
The noun conjunction bv⁸ke⁷ as illustrated in the previous example is used in Iau to mark
accompaniment and is best translated by the English glosses `with', `along with', or `also'. Nouns
marked by bv⁸ke⁷ usually have a minor role compared with unmarked nouns. In contrast, nouns
marked with the Iau noun conjunction be⁷⁻⁸de³ have a more topical role in the narrative. This is
illustrated by the following example.
Av⁸si⁷ be⁷⁻⁸de³ Ti⁸bo⁸ti⁷vs³ be⁷⁻⁸de³ a⁴
bv⁸ke⁷ tv⁹ bv⁸ i⁹.
Ausi
and
Timotius
and
father also
sago
for go-TOT.PUN
Ausi and Timotius along with father went to get sago.
The example above is taken from a narrative about how the speaker and his friend ambush Ausi
and Timotius as a joke while they are in the jungle getting sago. Ausi and Timotius are less
topical participants than the speaker and his friend so they are marked by the conjunction
be⁷⁻⁸de³. The speaker's father is the least topical participant since he being an adult was not69involved in ambush. The speaker's father is marked by the noun conjunction bv⁸ke⁷ to indicate
his nontopical role in the action.
The Iau noun conjunction da⁸ba³ /da⁷ba³ is used when the nouns in the list are a representative
listing, ie they represent the kinds of items or people who participated in the action but not
necessarily all the actual participants.
The following is an example.
Dy⁸ a⁴

go ahead and
come threaten-TEL.PUN
So then, any other fathers he has (ie father's brother's) come and threaten him. If he has any
uncles (ie mother's brothers), then they come over and threaten him.
The example above is taken from a scene in an Iau narrative in which a murderer has returned to
his village after a long absence. The relatives of the murdered boy confront him and threaten to
shoot him in retaliation. In the narrative above, the speaker is telling the hearer the kinds of
relatives that might threaten to kill the murderer if they happened to be present at the time the
murderer returned. He marks the noun phrase `other fathers' with the noun conjunction da⁸ba³ to
indicate that this is representative of the kind of relative that opposed the murderer when he
showed up again.
6.0 LAYERED CLAUSE STRUCTURE: NUCLEUS, CORE, PERIPHERY
Words and particles combine to form phrases. Words and phrases combine to form clauses.
Clauses like phrases have language specific structure.
Clauses in various languages are sometimes classified on the basis of verb types such as stative,
equative, intransitive, transitive and bitransitive. The classification of Iau clauses on the basis of
verb types, is not a very helpful classification, since Iau verb stems do not have inherent lexical
transitivity. The following are some examples of clauses varying in transitivity but using the
same verb.
BE =be in or on a place

In all the examples above, the nominalized clause fills a noun phrase slot in the clause.
Iau nominalized clauses can also be used in narrative settings in the left most sentence slot at the
beginning of a discourse to introduce global participants and , give temporal setting information
in narrative discourse as illustrted below.

The two nominalized clauses are ‘I, in the past’ and ‘when I was at Fibehui’.
6.3.5.2 Topicalized Clauses
Whole clauses can also be made topics as illustrated in the following example where the clause
“when we were just now coming here” is nominalized and topicalized by it’s fronted position.
"" Ty⁷da⁷y³ y⁸ da⁶ bi

-y⁹

In the following example a hypothetical situation is topicalized and then commented on.

If it was true that you you had not killed one of us, then you could have had me as your
wife. (A dead man's brother had just killed one of his brothers two wives and now wanted
to take the other for his own wife)
The example above with the status particle ‘di⁷’ ‘would have’ in the nominalized clause shows
that nominalized clauses can take postverbal status and evidential particles. However they do not
take the sentence final illocutionary force particles.
Another example of another Iau structure in which a clause is topicalized and commented on is
given below.

It’s the young boys that if they shoot the pigs from close up, it would be good, don’t you
think?
6.3.5.3 Descriptive Clauses
A third type of construction acts as a kind of descriptive relative clause. The statement could be a
response to an unidentified sound, a unidentified picture, or something the speaker and hearer
can both see.
Ba⁷bv⁹ te⁸ de⁹?

What is that/this? (response to a something seen or heard)
Ba⁷bv⁹ du³si⁷ du⁷be⁷ dae⁷
sa -3
This chicken that is by a dog bite -Tot.Dur
That is a chicken that is being bit by a dog.
6.6 Clause Conjunctions
Iau clause conjunctions are clitics that occur clause final. They are of two types. Medial verb
clause conjunctions are two syllable clitics that occur clause final on medial verb clauses as
illustrated below.
a⁶ty⁹ be⁸
a⁷se⁹
a⁹ fi⁵
o -7
da⁸dv⁹
mother PredInfoAg SeqMkr; me away_from, take -Tot.Inc and-then
my mother took it from me and then,101Subordinate clause conjunctions are one syllable clitics that occur clause final on subordinate
clauses as illustrated below.
A⁹ a⁶ty⁹ be⁸ tau⁶ fo⁴

Taking off the sling,
te³ da³ be⁷⁻⁸
di⁹ bv⁸ i⁹.

and putting me on the floor, mother went after (the rest of) the things.
The Iau clause conjunctions in addition to marking the type of clause as medial versus
subordinate also mark the semantic relationship between the medial or subordinate clause and
the subsequent clause. The following are some examples of relationships marked by medial verb
conjunctions.

"9.1.1 Yes-No Questions in Iau
Yes-no questions are formed in Iau by adding a yes-no question marker be or ba, which can be
used interchangeably, and by changing the tone on the verb stem according to the verb class
requirements.. In the example below, the first sentence is a simple statement. The second
sentence is a yes-no question formed from this statement.
1.Au⁷ du⁹
bv⁸ i⁹.
he wild pig for go
He went hunting. (Lit. He went to get a wild pig.)
2.Au⁷ du⁹
bv⁸ i⁷ ba³?
he wild pig for go ?-Uncertain
Did he go hunting?
The bolded words in the second sentence above illustrate the changes used in Iau to form a yesno question. The question marker ba³ is added to indicate that the speaker thinks it is true that the
man has gone hunting, but he is not sure. The example above also illustrates how the tone is
changed on tone 9 verbs in yes-no questions. A tone 9 (high level tone) is changed to a tone 7
(high rising tone). In the sentences above i⁹ becomes i⁷.
The following pairs of sentences show the tone changes for tone 3 verbs and tone 5 verbs. The
tone 3, low falling tone, is changed to a tone 8, low level tone. A tone 5 high low falling tone is
changed to a tone 4 high falling verb in the question form.
1. Tone 3 change to tone 8
Au⁷ fv⁷ da⁸ du³.
he plane carry go along
He flies the plane.
Au⁷ fv⁷
da⁸ du⁸
ba³?
he plane carry go along ?-Uncertain
Does he fly the plane?
2. Tone 5 change to tone 4
Au⁷ a⁷se⁹ ty⁷
foi⁵.
he SqMk person tell
He told them.
Au⁷ a⁷se⁹ ty⁷
foi⁴ ba³?
he SqMk person tell ?-Uncertain
Has he already told them?
The other tones on verbs, 6, 2, and 8 do not change when a yes-no question marker is added.
Different tones are used on the sentence final question marker to show different degrees of
uncertainty on the part of the speaker. There are three different tones that can occur on a be yesno question marker. A tone 3 indicates that the speaker thinks the information in the question is110correct but he is not sure. All the previous examples in this section have had a tone 3 on the
question marker.
A tone 9 on the question marker means the speaker thinks the information in the question is
correct and doesn't expect the hearer to correct him. However, he does want the hearer to answer
him. This kind of question can occur in an interview or a teaching situation where the speaker is
trying to get the hearer to give him a yes answer. The following question is an example.
Dy⁴be⁷ a⁴ a⁷se⁹
ui⁸ bv⁸ tv⁹
be⁹?
then father already house to go away ?-Certain
So then, father went home?
The speaker in the example above knows that father has gone home but he wants the hearer to
say it.
A tone 4 on the question marker means that the speaker is not at all sure that the information in
his question is correct. He thinks it is highly likely that the speker will correct him. The
following sentence is an example of tone 4 on a question marker.
Da⁹ a² tv⁹ be⁴?
you pl land-by go away ?-Vuncertain
I guess you traveled by land?
In the question above the speaker has never been to the place they are talking about so he is just
guessing. This is indicated by the tone 4 marker be⁴.

dialogues.

What was he doing when he got attacked by pig? (be⁸du⁷ interruption in expected flow of
event)? He was taking his dog out hunting when he was attacked by a pig.
Note that in the examples above, most of the information in the clause is already known /given.
The unknown item indicated by the question becomes the focus, that is the new predicated
information about the topicwhich is the given part of the clause.
The following is a list of content question words in Iau.

In general, te⁸ means `what' or `where', ty⁷⁻⁸ means `who' and to⁴ refers to questions about events
‘what happened?’. The other syllables on the end of the question words are various noun and
verb markers which identify the function of the word in the sentence as well as it’s focus status..
Each of the types of question words will be discussed below.","[110, 111]"
"2I began this research with a background in tagmemics learned at SIL N Carolina, Norman, Oklahoma and Dallas,
TX. Through field workshops especially an early workshop by Ivan Lowe in the early 1980’s, and our Indonesia
Branch library, I had exposure to a wide range of linguistic writings. I was exposed to the writings of Hopper,
Thompson and Li, Givon, Comrie, Longacre, Grimes, Foley, Van Valin, and others. Later at North Dakota SIL I
received consultant help by Tom Dooley, as well as exposure to Foley and Van Valin in more depth. (See
Bibliography.) All of these influences are reflected in this paper. I am grateful for consulting help and mentoring in
writing papers given by Ken Gregerson, a consultation session with Bernard Comrie at a workshop in Papua New
Guinea, consultant help on the tone and segmentals paper by Eunice Pike, and encouragement by Larry Jones
through general comments on a paper he looked at.

The information presented in this paper is a summary and in some cases an update of a number of published and
unpublished papers (See Bateman 1982-1989) In this paper basic information about Iau discourse grammar as well
as some semantic and pragmatic observations is made available for others working in related languages in Irian
Jaya.

The Tariku river is a western branch of the Mamberamo. This river is also known from Dutch days as the Rouffaer
River. It has a southern branch along the central mountain range, known in Dutch days as the van Dalaan. There is a

3.2 Nouns And Noun Morphology
There are no grammatical noun classes in Iau. Nouns form a single grammatical class. In general,
there is no inflection of nouns, ie no affixes marking for singular and plural, no marking for
gender, no case marking affixes (case marking takes place on the phrase level), or affixes
marking definiteness or indefiniteness. There are, however, a few locative nouns that undergo
tone changes or tone plus a vowel change in certain contexts. There are also a few agent
/instrument nouns that have tone and vowel changes that mark the noun as instrument or agent.
These are discussed along with tone changes on adverbs and noun phrases in a separate section
below (See 3.3 below)
3.2.1 Derived Nouns
Iau has many nouns that appear to be derivatives of the verb stem or formed from the same roots
as the verb stems, or related to part of the verb stem. The following are some examples.

6.1 Constituents Of Iau Clauses10
The layered clause structure presented in Van Valin (1993) is a helpful model for discussing
clause constituents and their ordering in Iau. In Van Valin's model, the clause constituents are
defined semantically rather than grammatically. The clause consists of three layers, nucleus, core
and periphery. Each layer is separated from the others by operators. The operators are particles
carrying grammatical categories such as aspect, modality, directionals, negation, evidentials and
mood . The operators are juxtaposed to the clause level constituents they modify or operate on.
For example nuclear operators are located at boundaries between nuclear and core constituents.
Likewise core operators are located at boundaries between core and peripheral constituents, and
peripheral operators are located at the clause periphery. Each of the three clause layers and their
operators will be discussed below.",[71]

3.1.3.2 Grammatical Aspect and the Iau Tone Morphemes
Grammatical aspect is used to show the relationship of actions and states to time and to the
other events in the context. Grammatical aspect signals the temporal viewpoint of the event such
as punctual/perfective (as single unit), durative/imperfective (occurs over extended period of
time, overlapping, repetitive, gnomic or generic truth statements and the like) as well as various19temporal aspects of the event like inceptive, incompletive /interrupted etc. Grammatical aspect
is governed by the grammatical context.
Punctual/PerfectiveDurative/ImperfectiveTotality Of
Action9Resultative68Telic52Incompletive
74Punctual aspect sees the action simply as something that happens or has happened. This is the
aspect used most often in chains of actions related by cause-effect or chronological sequence.
Each action is seen as a unit or point in time or on an eventline. It other kinds of discourse it is
used on statements of fact and assertions. The three punctual aspects are totality of action,
resultative events and telic events. Punctual-Totality of Action viewpoint aspect is often referred
to as PERFECTIVE aspect.
Durative aspect sees the event as a process or extended action occurring over time. The
linguistic terms progressive, continuative, durative, and repetitive /iterative all refer to actions
occuring over an extended period of time, often overlapping with other events and occuring
multiple times, but number and time of occurrence is indefinite. The three durative aspects are
totality of action, resultative events and telic processes and events. Durative aspect verbs are
often referred to as IMPERFECTIVE verbs.
Incompletive aspectual viewpoints view the action as incomplete in some way. Inceptive
viewpoints view the action as just beginning (began to, started to). Incompletive verbs can
include interrputed, or postponed actions. Or they can have no definite ending.
In Iau events that are planned, but not yet executed, about to begin but not yet, also have an
incompletive aspectual viewpoint as well as discussions of events as possible or probable. Using
incompletive aspect the Iau can discuss hypothetical events as well. These events are irrealis
(never happened) but are being viewed as if they had happened or will happen. There are only
two incompletive aspects in Iau, totality of action and telic action.
This is summarized in the following chart:

3.1.3.3 Tone Classes And Their Grammatical Variants
Sections 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2 dealt with the issues of semantic aspect viewpoints of an event
realized in the languages lexicon and grammatical aspect in Iau. As stated in the opening to
3.1.3.1, another way of looking at the Iau aspect tone morphemes is to use the tone morphemes
to divide Iau verbs into lexical classes. This would divide Iau verbs into tone classes.
In the tone aspect morpheme chart below, there are four of the basic aspects that often result in
different lexical meanings.","[19, 20]"
"52The iy particle indicates that the speaker is giving information on which he considers himself an
expert. He considers the hearer ignorant on the subject. The following is an example.

Spkr 2: No, (ours) wait now and then (later) they get married.
In the example above the speakers are discussing the marital status of a young girl. Speaker 2 as
an inside member of the culture is informing Speaker 1, an outsider, of the marriage customs in
the village. The particle iy indicates that he considrs himself knowledgable.
The by particle gives information that the speaker feels is highly likely to be true as illustrated in
the example below.
Di⁹ bai⁸si⁷
by³.
1S fall-TOT.INC Probable-SNC.ADT
You might fall.
The by particle frequently occurs on propostions that are the grounds for some command or
prohibition in the context. It also is used on recommendations for action and predictions.
The be/ba particle is used to indicate that the speaker is giving information that he is unsure of, ie
he is not sure that it is true. The following is an example.

The be/ba particles are interchangeable according to native speakers. In the sentences above the
speaker suspects that the hearer is lying but has no proof. He indicates his uncertainty by
marking the sentence with the particle ba.
The to particle is used to give information that the speaker is using to refute, contradict, or deny
previous information content, or the underlying assumptions of other speakers. The to particle
also marks statements where the speaker is emphasizing that his own beliefs, opinions, or
experiences are contrary to the hearer's. The following sentences are some examples.

Tone Class Resultative Verbs (6)The resultative punctual tone, forms the last class of Iau verbs. The resultative verbs focus on the
result of an action. They are inherently undergoer or experiencer focus, as illustrated by the
following examples:
di⁶ get /be startled
bai⁶ beach /put to shore (a canoe)
e⁶ to exclaim,cry out
(a⁵) tai⁶ touchdown!/has landed (plane)
bav⁶ wither and die (plant)
kavy⁶ wiggle/move (eg a rock)
These verbs do not have any other variant tone in their class. Whether in combination with
various epistemic and deontic modal particles, and negatives, and in medial verb clauses as well
as main clauses, their tone does not change. They view the action as punctual and resultative.

In the examples above there are several different choices of locations. The `which' question word
te⁸bai⁵ or tebai⁵de⁸dv⁷ is used in situations where the speaker has all of the specific choices in
front of him and wants the hearer to point out which of these choices he is referring to. The
`which' question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ is used when the speaker knows there are several possible
locations but does not know where they all are. For example in (3) above he can't see the place
where the path is and so he asks the hearer to point it out for him.
‘Which’ question words can also be used to ask about the source location of something, ie which
place it is from. The following are some examples.
1.Di⁹ a⁵ te⁸bai⁴de⁸de⁷?
2s land which from
Which place do you come from? /Where do you come from?
9.1.5 Why Questions
`Why' questions in Iau can mean either `for what reason?' or `for what purpose'. The following
are some examples.
1.Fv⁷ te⁷bv⁹ ba⁷ ae⁷ da³?

Why didn't the plane come, as it was supposed to?
2.Di⁹ te⁷bv⁹ ta⁸ dai⁷si⁹ da⁸ i⁹ a³?

The first example above illustrates a why question word te⁷bv⁹ to ask `for what reason?' The
second example above illustrates the use of the question word te⁷bv⁹ to ask `for what purpose?'.
In Iau `why' questions are frequently used as rhetorical questions to indicate that the speaker
feels that the situation never should have happened. The following is an example.
A⁹ te⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ bei⁷ ae⁷ da³?

5.1.3.2 Epistemic Modality:Status and Evidential Particles
Epistemic modality is a sub-type of linguistic modality that deals with a speaker's
evaluation/judgment of, degree of confidence in, or belief in the knowledge upon which a
proposition is based. In other words, epistemic modality refers to the way speakers communicate
their doubts, certainties, and guesses—their ""modes of knowing"".
Status

Temp Bound +T²
di,be,ay,a

In Iau following the negative slot in the verb phrase, there is a slot for status particles and after
that a slot for evidential particles. These particles comment on realis properties of the marked
event, the characteristics and degree of definiteness of it’s occurrence, mark the speakers
evaluation of its truth and relationship to common knowledge.
The following are some examples.

The `what' question word te⁸du⁷ consists of the question particle te⁸ and du⁷ a left dislocation as
focus info particle. Te⁸du⁷ is used to ask about the identity of a thing when it is new information
placed in a left dislocated topic position. Normally information in this position would be already
given, not new predicated information. This is in contrast to the previous form te⁸de⁹ which is
used as a predicate in the sentence, the normal location for new predicated information. The
following are some examples.
1.Bv⁷ te⁸du⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³?

What is this that is coming?
Bv⁷ da⁷ du⁷be⁷ ba³.

The question word te⁸be⁸de⁷ means `what kind of/from where' and is usually used in reference to
people to ask what group or race they belong to. It is a description question word. (See also the
section on `Where Questions.) The following question and answer set is an example.

Sentences are made up of clauses. The nuclear component of a sentence is always the
independent clause. In an Iau sentence the independent clause is always sentence final, preceded
by optional medial and subordinate clauses or in the case of a compound clause sentence, more
than one independent clause.
Medial Verb Clause

Iau sentences also have optional fronted elements. These optional fronted elements consist of
response particles, vocatives, paragraph or sentence cluster level conjunctions as shown below

There are three basic sentence types in Iau: simple sentences, compound, and complex.
7.1 Simple Sentences
Simple sentences consist of a single independent clause plus or minus any left dislocated topics.
The following is an illustration.
Ty⁷ a⁷se⁹
bi⁷si⁹ su⁵.

One person died. OR There was one person that died. (This would reflect a context where
the fact that people had died was known)

7.2 Compound Sentences
Compound sentences consist of two or more sentence types joined together by the sentence level
conjunctions dy⁴da⁸dv⁹ ‘and so (resultative)’ di⁴du⁷be⁷ but (adversative) dy⁴be⁹se⁹
(conclusion), or dy⁴be⁸du⁷ ‘when..’ (changed /interrupted by following event). See sections 6.6

7.3 Complex Sentences
Complex sentences consist of a combination of dependent clauses (either medial verb clauses,
adverbial subordinate clauses or a combination of the two) and a simple or compound sentence.
The following is an example of a complex sentence formed by a medial verb clause with an
independent clause nucleus.

from far away. It’s the small people (young (nimble) boys) who it’s alright to shoot them
from right next to them /close up.
In examples 1-4 above the postposition foe⁴ is marked with a tone 4. In example 5 the tone
changes from 4 to 4-7. This example is made up of two contrastive sentences. Full grown men
are contrasted with boys in the way it is advisable for them to shoot at pigs. Both contrastive
manners are marked with tone 7. The word for ‘far away’ davy⁷ is normally davy⁸. Davy⁷ di⁸
‘shooting from far away’is contrasted with foe⁴⁻⁷ di⁸ ‘shooting from close up.’ The function of
the tone 7 here is something like the function of the be particle which marks nouns as the new
information being predicated by the clause.
The postpostition ta⁷ normally has a tone 7 on it and fills the postpostion slot phrase final.
However, when the noun phrase is part of a clause with a stative locative verb, the postpostion
ta⁷ changes to ta⁹ and becomes a clitic attached to a verb or adverb.

Both wild pigs and whatever kind of bird there is, all of them were inside the fay⁵
bamboo.
The first example above shows the postposition ta⁷ in it’s unmarked distribution. In the second
clause in the example above. The postposition ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is a clitic attached to the verb
and means ‘live in’ Note in the first clause above that the postpostion ta⁷ becomes ta⁹ and is
attached as a clitic to the directional adverb bi² and means ‘up inside’.
There are two compound postpositionals, tai⁵ta⁹ ‘in/down in (eg the ground)’ and ta⁹bi² ‘be
inside /up inside’.

5.2.2.2 Possessive Noun Phrases
There are four different kind of possessive noun phrases in Iau. The first type of possessive noun
phrase consists of the item possessed followed by the possessor followed a possessive marker.
There are two alternative possesive markers in Iau. The following sentences are examples.

The possessive marker be⁸sy⁹ is more definite. It is used with named persons. The possessive
marker bv⁹ is used with generic class nouns and descriptive phrases.
In the second type of possessive phrase, a possessive pronoun is used to identify the possessor.
In these types of phrases, no possessive marker is used as illustrated below.
Da⁷ av⁷bv⁹
dog his

The third type of possessive noun phrase in Iau consists of the possessor followed by the item
possessed followed by a possessive marker as illustrated below.
Ty⁷

the owner of the dog
The fourth type of possessive noun phrase is used for body parts and consists of the possessor
followed by the body part followed by a possessive pronoun. The following is an example.

5.2.2.3 Appositional Noun Phrases in Iau
Appositional noun phrases are two noun phrases placed side by side in which the second noun
phrase identifies the participants in the first noun phrase. The following are some examples in
Iau.","[64, 65, 66, 67]"
"5.1.2 THE VERB PHRASE NUCLEUS

5.1.2.1 The Verb
As discussed above in the section on verb roots, stems and words, Iau verbs are morphemically
complex. The majority are single syllables. The verb/verb phrase is always clause final. Verbs
are not inherently bitransitive, transitive or intransitive. The number of arguments is contextually
determined which then influences which of the possible lexical choices is to be read in that given
context.
5.1.2.2 Stative Particle
Stative is an optional morpheme “de” attached to the verb stem with an accompanying tone
morpheme. Tones that occur on the “de” stative particle are 9,8, 7 depending on the grammatical
context and function of the verb.

Usually tones on nouns, adjective and adverbs do not change since they are a lexical part of the
word.
3.2.3 Tone Changes On Nouns
Some locative nouns change from their usual tone to a high rising tone (7) when they are
referring to an already known or highly expected location in the context. This is illustrated in the
following sentence taken from the introduction to a short narrative text.

dog SeqMkr bark-TOT.DUR
After getting out of school, we had gone in (to the house) and were sleeping there in the
house when a dog barked at something.
In the example above, the noun ui⁷ `house' is marked by a tone 7 instead of its usual tone 8. In
the context, the location `in the house' is implicit in the verb bai⁶, in that the lexical meaning of
this verb implies a building or someplace a person can enter. The house is the most likely place
one would enter after leaving school and so when it is explicitly mentioned it is marked as
highly expected by the change to a tone 7. One way this could be translated is: “After we had had
school we had gone in and we were sleeping there (in the place we entered, that is) in the house
when…
Tone changes also take place on a few common nonhuman agents when these agents are not the
topic of the sentence or clause. The following is an example of a tone change.
Da⁷ dai⁶
ka⁹ka⁶
di³.
dog cassowary-by wound-RES.PUN TDef-RLZ
The dog was wounded by the cassowary.
The Iau noun for `cassowary', dai³ normally has a tone 3 on it. When dai³ `cassowary' is a
nontopical agent (ie the one who acts on the topic noun da⁷ `dog'), then it is marked by a tone
change from tone 3 to tone 6.
3.3.2 Vowel And Consonant Changes On Nouns
Some common nouns show both tone and vowel changes.
The Iau noun for dog, da⁷, undergoes a vowel change to dae⁷ when it is nontopical agent.

The adverb davy⁸ ‘far away’ and the adverb foe⁴ ‘close up’ are examples of adverbs undergoing
a tone change to indicate the word is nonverbal predicated information.","[28, 29]"
"The punctual forms (9,6,5) along with the totality of action durative form (3) are used to assert
occurrence and assert as fact.
The durative and incompletive forms (7,4,8,2) are used in grammatical contexts that require
irrealis, completive, durative or resultative forms.
Tone Class Totality of Action Events (9.7)Totality of Action tone 9 verbs regularly substitute tone 7 in irrealis grammatical contexts like
imperatives, intentions and statements of probability or future predictions. The following are
some typical uses of tone 9 and tone 7 for this tone class.
A⁹ ba⁹ bi⁸fa⁹
I word speak-Tot.Punc
I speak words/ I spoke
Ba⁹ bi⁸fa⁷

irrealis.)
Ba⁹ bi⁸fa⁷
by³.
Word speak-Tot.Inc might, will
He will /might speak.
(Speaking has not yet happened, but is proposed/commanded so that requires a tone 7
irrealis.)
In this first set of examples, there is a realis statement with tone 9.The following examples with
tone 7 are all situations where the action is contemplated but has not actually happened.
The next example is a medial verb clause –and if or when clause, part of a conditional sentence..

bv⁸ dui⁸ da⁸
ae⁵.
I Word speak-Tot.Inc and-then peole not heart becz shake presupposed not-Emph21If I speak, no way people will be happy /will not be happy at all.
The tone class 9 event above is hypothetical, not realis and may never happen. So it is marked
by a tone 7 as such.
The following example is taken from a narrative sequence of events, linked by medial verb
repetitive clauses. The linking clauses signal the chain is not finished, another event follows.

This example illustrates the substitution of a tone 7 incomplete aspect in the repeated clause that
indicates the chain of events in not complete. There is more to follow. The main events of the
chain are all marked by Totality of Action view points as independent main clause verbs. I
spoke. I went home. I ate.
When events are irrealis in the sense of being unrealized, still in the future, tone 7 telic
incompletive is substituted for tone 9.

requests, prohibitions, and desires. The following are some examples.
I⁷
dy³.
go-TOT.INC Imp-RS.SA
Go!
Sy⁹ e⁸fe⁷
o⁷
bv³.
Obl 1s-Benef take-TOT.INC Rq-RS.SA
Would you get it for me, please? /Please get it for me.
The first example above illustrates a command in Iau. The Imperative particle dy is marked by
tone 3 to indicate that the speaker regards himself as authoritative and he expects the hearer to
respond to his command. The second example above illustrates a tone 3 particle on a request.
The speaker considers himself as authoritative, ie he has the right to tell the hearer what to do.
He also expects the hearer to respond. The request particle bv softens the directive to a request
made with authority.
The tone 8 morpheme is used on imperatives when the speaker wants the command to be
executed in the immediate speech context. Tone 8 particles are frequently used on commands
shouted long distance as is illustrated in the following example.
Ta⁸
da⁸
ba⁷
dy⁸.
knife carry-RES.DUR come-TOT.INC Imp-RS.SA.IO
Bring the knife!
The sentence above is taken from a narrative about catching an animal that had escaped down
inside a hollow tree stump. The speaker is shouting to another man some distance away to bring
the bush knife so they can kill the animal they have located.
Tone 5 is used on first person plural directives `Let's' as illustrated in the following example.
Y⁸ i⁷
ba⁵.
1P go-TOT.INC Imp-SRS.SNA
Let's go!
In the example above, as marked by tone 5, the speaker is suggesting an action to the hearer but
regards himself as nonauthoritative relative to the hearer, ie he doesn't have the authority to tell
the hearer what to do.
Tone 4 is used on directives when the speaker is indicating a wish or desire but he feels the
hearer will probably not be willing to comply. Tone 4 is also used on indirect commands when
the speaker feel he has no right to tell the hearer what to do. The following is an example.

The speaker making the request above is not commanding the hearer to give him the object in
question. He marks his request as indirect by using the statement mood particle y and a tone 4
morpheme which is nonauthoritative and persuades but does not command the hearer to respond.
The Tone Morphemes on Statement Mood Particles
Statements are used in conversational discourse to give information to the hearer(See Longacre
1976 for a fascinating discussion that has been helpful in analysis Iau dialogue). The tone
morphemes on statement mood markers in Iau indicate the relationship of the participants and
relation of the information content to discourse topic. The chart below displays the meanings of
the tone morphemes that occur on mood particles in statements. Tones 6, 5 and 2 do not occur on
statement mood particles in Iau.","[57, 58]"

9.1.6 How Questions
`How' questions are used to elicit procedures. The basic `how' question word in Iau is either
te⁸dau⁴ or te⁸fau⁴. These two question words appear to be interchangeable. The event question
word to⁴ can also be used in Iau to elicit either descriptions or demonstrations of the procedure
for using something. The following are some examples of `how' questions in Iau.

The examples above illustrate subordinate clauses as means, sequence, purpose and circumstance
clauses.
Iau adverbial subordinate clauses are characterized by the following structural features. They do
not take major sentence stress and are marked by an obligatory monosyllabic particles. The
examples above illustrate the use of the three most common subordinate adverbial clause
marking particles, be⁷, be⁷⁻⁸ , se⁹ and de⁹.
Iau adverbial subordinate clauses allow all of the aspect tone morphemes (including 3, 9, 5) to
occur on the verb, but do not take status, evidential or illocutionary force particles. The following
example illustrates the use of a tone 3 on the verb in an adverbial subordinate clause.
Au⁷ a⁷se⁹ ta⁸
vy³ be⁷
tv⁹.
he SeqMkr machete take ASC lMkr go away-Tot.Pun
Taking his machete, he left.
Adverbial subordinate clauses frequently are used to give information about factors which affect,
facilitate or characterize the performance of the verb they modify. The following sentences are
examples.

Like medial verb clauses, subordinate clauses can occur in narrative clauses in chains, but
usually with only two or three clauses in the sequence, as illustrated from the text above as well
as the following text below.

International, PO Box 1561 /JKS, Jakarta 12015 IndonesiaThere are two closely related dialects of Iau, Turu and Foi. (Early SIL Lakes Plains survey
reports, McAllister 1979, Clouse, 1993) The Turu dialect area is upstream, to the west of the Iau
dialect area. The Foi dialect area located to the north, midway on the nothern Tariku/Rouffaer
River. The Foi area is the “old country”. The great grandparents of both the current Turu and
current Iau generations pushed out the Duvle and moved into their current locations from the Foi
area current area in the distant memorable past5Map “Peta Bahasa Di Papua”, by SIL International ©2003 SIL International, PO Box 1561 /JKS,
Jakarta 12015 IndonesiaThe most closely related language to these three dialects is Edopi, located upstream on the
Rouffaer River and to the slightly to the northwest of the Turu area . There is no direct river
connection between the Edopi and the Turu, only over land and much of it swamp. The Turu
have the most contact with the Edopi area, as was also true in their originating location on
western upstream end of the Foi area. even before their move. The Iau settled to the south of the
Foi area and to the east of the Turu. Both took over territory from the Duvle who speak a another
Lakes Plains language. Duvle is classified as a isolate by some or with the languages spoken at
Dou and Kaiy with whom they intermarry.
Edopi is spoken at villages to the west of (/upstream from) the Foi dialect villages on the
Rouffaer River. Edopi is approximately 70 % cognate with Iau (I have lost the original
references –See Clouse? ) Turu seems to be the closest of the three Iau dialects to Edopi. Iau is
closer to the Foi dialect.","[3, 4]"
"NOTE: the following sections on clauses were for the most part researched at University of
North Dakota SIL under Dooley following the Foley and Van Valin model (Foley, William A and
Robert D. Van Valin, 1984).
10716.1.1 CLAUSE NUCLEUS
The clause nucleus consists of the verb, adverb, and the nuclear operators of aspect, stative and
directionals. Iau is a SOV language so the clause nucleus is clause final. So the clause nucleus is
the default unit of predication.
The following are some illustrations of the Iau clause nucleus. The nucleus is in bold.
1.","[71, 72]"
"1199.7 Third Party /Indirect Commands
In Iau there are two different ways that a command can be passed through a intermediary. The
following examples illustrate these two ways.
1. Au⁷ sy⁹ i⁷
bv³.
3s shld go-TOT.INC Request
He should go. /(Tell him) he should go, if he is willing.
2. Y⁸ boi⁸
bv⁸ i⁷
se³.
1p firewood for go-TOT.INC Inten
Ba⁷
dy³ di²⁻⁷
to⁴.
come-TOT.INC Imp shld happen RfHr-SNC.NA.NDT
We are going to get firewood. You are supposed to come /should be coming too./(She said)
you have to come too.
The first example above passes the command along in the form of a polite request. The bv³
particle in Iau is used to request permission or instruction from the hearer as to what he wants to
be done. The second example above uses the particle di²⁻⁷ to indicate that the speaker and the
originator of the command expect the hearer to comply but feel that the hearer may be resistant.
The verb is marked by the command particle dy.
9.8 Requests for Permission or Direction
The bv³ particle in Iau is also used to mark requests for permission to do something or requests
for the hearer to tell the speaker what the speaker should do. the following are some examples.
1.A⁹ i⁷
bv³?
1s go-TOT.INC Rqst
Shall I go? /May I go?
2.A⁹ te⁸bai⁵ ui⁷
bv³?
1s where stand-TOT.INC Rqst
Where shall I stand? /Where do you want me to stand?
In both of the examples above the speaker is giving the hearer the opportunity to tell him what
he, the hearer, wants the speaker to do.
9.9 Prohibitions
Prohibitions are negative commands. They command the hearer not to do something. In Iau
prohibitions are marked by two different particles that occur together, dy⁴sy⁷ meaning `shouldn't'
and day³ meaning `negative command'. The following prohibition is an example.
Di⁹ dy⁴sy⁷ i⁷
day³.
2s shldnt go-TOT.INC Prohib
Don't go! /You shouldn't go!
Iau also has statements which are used as indirect prohibitions. These statements are marked by a
contrary to desire particle fe in Iau. The negative obligation particle dy⁴sy⁷ `shouldn't' can also be
used in these statements. The following are some examples.
1.Si⁸a⁷da³ doe⁷
fe⁷⁻⁸.
Janet
see-TOT.INC CntrDesire
Janet might see it! /Lest Janet see it.
2.Ty⁷ dy⁴sy⁷ y⁸ di⁸
fe⁷⁻⁸.
person shldn't 1p kill-RES.DUR ContrDesire
They might kill us (and we don't want that to happen).
The examples above are used in contexts where the speaker is protesting against or rejecting a
proposed action because he foresees an undesirable consequence.
9.3 Statements
Statements in Iau that convey information to the speaker can be marked by a number of sentence
final particles that indicate the speaker's attitude toward the information content of the sentence.
The following is a list of the Iau statement marking particles.
y
iyan answer, opinion, observation, announcement
speaker is an expert, hearer is ignorant
120to
e
byinformation is being used to refute or contradict the hearer
information is being used to explain or justify another statement
information in the sentence is a prediction speculation or recommendation based
on knowledge or experience
ba /be
probable or possibly true information
The statement particle y is the most commonly occuring statement particle in Iau. The particle y
marks answers, opinions, observations, comments, announcements, and statements of wishes or
desires. The following are some examples.
1A. Di⁹ te⁷bv⁸ i⁹
a³?
2s what for go-TOT.PUN MUbd-RLZ
What are you going to get?
B. A⁹ y⁷
bv⁸ i⁹

2. Si⁶
au⁷sy⁹ av⁸be⁸day⁸ te⁷ fv²
a⁹
y³.
woman ours
quickly man tie to-TEL.DUR MUbd-FACT Info-SNC.ADT
Our women quickly get married (ie marry young).
The particle iy is used when the speaker feels that he has expert or `inside' knowledge in contrast
to the hearer who is ignorant on the subject. The following sentence is an example.
Ba⁶⁻³ da⁶ a⁷se⁹
bv⁸ bai⁴de⁷
da⁸dv⁹ te⁷
Well now SeqMkr for wait-Sta-HYP MVbCj man
te⁷
fv²
a⁹
be⁴
iy³.
Man tie to-TEL.DUR MUbd-FACT is-TEL.INC InfoU-SNC.ADT
Well, our (women) wait and then (later) they are married.
The example above is taken from the same conversation as the previous example. The first
speaker has given information about marriage customs in his culture. The following speaker
gives information about a contrastive custom and indicates that this is contrastive inside
knowledge as compared with what the hearer knows by using the particle iy.
The particle to in Iau is used to indicate that the speaker is using the information in the sentence
to contradict the hearer in some way or he is expressing surprise or shock. The following are
some examples.
1.Bv⁷ te⁷ ae⁶
to⁹.
this man Neg-FACT RHr-SC.ADT
She has no husband!
2.Ai⁶av²! Dy⁴ so⁶ av⁷bv⁹ bv⁸ fe⁷su⁷
to⁴.
Exclam then child his
for feel pity RHr-SNC.NA.NDT
That's too bad! I'm shocked and sorry for his children.
In the first example above, the speaker is contradicting the previous speaker's assumption that the
woman is married. The particle to indicates that she is not just informing the hearer that the
woman is not married but is also indicating that the previous speakers question is not relevant
because the assumption on which it was based is wrong. The second example illustrates the use
of the particle to to indicate that the speaker is shocked or surprised by the news he has heard.
The Iau particle e is used to indicate that the speaker is using the statement to justify or explain
his action. The following conversational excerpt illustrates the use of this particle.
A.Di⁹ to⁶ ba³tu³ sa⁸
