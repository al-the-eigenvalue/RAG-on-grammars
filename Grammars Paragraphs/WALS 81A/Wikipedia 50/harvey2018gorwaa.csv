The following subsection is concerned with words or word groupings which act as a
single unit within the structured hierarchy of the larger clause. Following the1712. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa
presentation of constituent order in main clauses, this subsection will treat verb
phrases, noun phrases, adpositional phrases, and comparatives.
2.5.1 Constituent order in main clauses
Basic constituent order in pragmatically neutral clauses is Subj. Obj. Sel V, where:
Subj. = Subject
Obj.= Object
P= Patient
Sel= Selector (glossed here as ProObj and =Imprf)
V= Verb

"Free Word Order
The first piece of evidence that most nouns are base-generated outside of the TP
is that they are not sensitive to the ordering restrictions imposed by the
Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (Baker 1988), which states that like
thematic relations between items are represented by like structural3997. The linker
relationships. For example, in §3.3 finches, as patient of the verb examine, will
always be generated as the internal argument of the verb, whereas Charles, the
agent of the verb examine, will always be generated as the external argument of
the verb. This results in a strict SVO word order in English. In Gorwaa, though
SOV word order is common enough to be considered canonical, Gorwaa nouns
may appear in any order relative to each other, and relative to the verb.

"8.4 Prospects
The most immediate step following from this thesis is further descriptive work.
Detailed examination of nominal morphosyntax has uncovered a plethora of
fascinating patterns, relevant for the writing of a Gorwaa grammar, as well as
lexicographic work. Doubtless, the same sort of attention to the morphosyntax of
the verb, or indeed larger phrasal domains will be equally fruitful and relevant.
It has been established in this work that nouns are typically not arguments to the
verb. In §7.3.3.1, free word order, syntactically discontinuous expressions, and
pervasive NP-dropping were shown to exist in Gorwaa -- each key characteristics of
a pronominal argument language (Jelinek 1984, Hale 2003).

4.3.5 Wordhood: summary
To summarize, four types of evidence were examined above in order to establish
the noun as a word: orthographic boundaries, pausa, word-internal phonological
operations, and indivisibility. Informal Gorwaa orthographies consistently place
boundaries between all lexical categories, but treat lexical categories with
enclitics as one orthographic word. Pausa occur following subject nouns, but not
obligatorily. Furthermore, no such pausa can be identified for object nouns.
Phonologically, the noun is reliably a metrical domain for syllabification and
stress-assignment. The segmental operation of epenthetic vowel insertion is a
consistent word-internal operation, but vowel coalescence, vowel assimilation,
and consonant cluster simplification may apply both within the word, as well
within elements larger than the word (e.g. the noun phrase). Most consistently,
noun-internal morphology cannot occur separate from the noun, whereas extranominal morphology may appear separate from the noun, attached to elements
such as demonstratives.","[223, 224]"

Prepositions are commonly combined with a special set of ‘locational nouns’ in
order to give more precise descriptions of space. Such preposition-locational noun
strings can run up to 3 elements long, and exhibit restrictions on ordering and cooccurrence. For more on locational nouns, see §2.3.1.3.
The lative ay is undoubtedly related to the adverbial suffix, -i. -i occurs consistently
in dative-shift constructions, in which a noun which may otherwise be expressed as
an adjunct is promoted to an object of the verb in a now double-object construction
(compare (2.238) (non-dative-shift) with (2.239) (dative-shift)). In this new dativeshift construction, -i encliticises to the end of the noun which would have served as
the direct object in the non-dative-shift construction.

"A similar line of argument may be used to establish that slee in (7.12)a) is not
within TP. Given that this noun occurs to the left of the selector, it is therefore
outside of the syntactic unit. This raises a more fundamental question: if nouns
such as slee in (7.12)a) are not part of the TP, then where, exactly, are they? I
argue that, with the exception of nouns such as those in (7.12)b) described
above, all overt nominal expressions in Gorwaa are base-generated outside of the
TP as adjuncts. Evidence for this claim will be provided in examining free word
order, syntactically discontinuous expressions, and pervasive NP-drop: all key
characteristics of non-configurationality (Jelinek 1984).",[399]

"3796. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
Furthermore, because the assignment of morphological case makes reference to the
syntactic structure (i.e. in assigning dative to the subject, and nominative to the
remaining caseless NP), it must occur after the syntax, but be sensitive to it. It is
argued that this post-syntactic stage is the morphology, which “takes a syntactic
structure as its input and incrementally alters that structure in order to produce a
phonological form” (296). Thus, quirky case and those phenomena similar to it are
called m-Case (m for morphological). Based on the argument that,
crosslinguistically, it is m-Case (and not any syntactic relation such as grammatical
function) which determines the accessibility of a given NP for controlling agreement
on the predicate, agreement must be a postsyntactic operation.","[379, 380]"

Within the larger architecture, this syntactic derivation represents one step in
the larger process. Following derivation, syntactic items are ‘spelled-out’, and
simultaneously transferred to the phonological component, where they receive
pronunciation (List 2), and to the semantic component, where they receive
meaning (List 3). Harley’s (2014) model, based Halle and Marantz (1993), is a
classic representation.leftmost element. This is the first time that such a configuration has been displayed, and
is essentially one of convenience, in that merging the elements in this way results in
finch-s, rather than -s finch and, therefore, eliminates the need for a Move operation.
Such a decision is not uncontroversial (see esp. Kayne 1994), but is licit under the rules
given up to this point (where the structure is sensitive to hierarchy, but not linear order).
This configuration will, in fact, suit the structure of the Gorwaa noun as well, and will be
employed throughout.","[208, 209]"

Minimalism employs four syntactic operations, each of which will be briefly
described and exemplified below. Note that the operations given below do not

Tense
Verbs inflect for tense, namely past and present8. Past tense is realized by rising
pitch accent (see Table 2.9). Present tense is zero-marked (see Table 2.6 above).
Because of extensive syncretism, the only time present and past tense may be
distinguished on the verb is when inflected for a 3rd person singular pronoun, or a
masculine noun, where there is level pitch accent for present and rising pitch accent
for past (2.94). All other present forms feature rising pitch accent as part of their
person/number agreement and are therefore identical to their past forms.

Mood includes indicative, subjunctive, and interrogative. All three are indicated
primarily by pitch-accent on the verb. Indicative is zero-marked (2.95). Subjunctive
is marked by level pitch accent (2.96), and by the suffix -i for pattern 1 verbs (see

adverbial case), it may be assumed that they are a form of highly inflected
auxiliary (cf. Anderson, 2011). Indeed, Mous (2005: 308) identifies the selector
as marking “the left hand edge of a syntactic unit”, a syntactic unit which I will
interpret as TP. As such, anything between the selector and the lexical V is
therefore within the TP and, furthermore, if located between the selector and the
lexical V, within a phonological phrase, hence the pronunciation of the linker on
nouns in this position.","[398, 399]"

sel < √ > ; NThis chapter addresses those patterns of Gorwaa suffixes which are ‘listed’:
requiring recourse to more detailed explanations of realization rules postSpellout (i.e. material from List 2 and List 3). Embick (2003) notes that “[a]ll
approaches to grammar must assume that some information is simply listed”
(144). Essentially, in English, the difference in grammaticality between two men
and *two man can be explained by recourse to the same sort of syntactic
structures as discussed in Chapter 5. However, the difference in grammaticality
between men and *mans is of a different nature. That is, it is not the expression3386. The suffix 2: the listed phenomena
of number value [plural] on the noun which is illicit (as men is a valid plural
form), but rather the manner in which it is expressed for this particular noun.
Whereas singular-plural pairs such as ban | bans, can | cans, fan | fans are licit,
man | mans is not. The man | mans error is not one of feature bundles being
manipulated by syntactic operations (ban | bans illustrates that such a
configuration is syntactically licit), rather, it is an error of how that structured set
of feature bundles comes to be realized for that particular form. In order to
recognize the ungrammaticality of man | *mans, and the grammaticality of man |
men, one must simply know that this is the way this particular word works.
Knowledge is not of the syntax, but of the particular lexical item: it is listed.
Embick goes on to state that “[h]ow this information is listed, and whether or not
listedness correlates with grammatical phenomena in a systematic fashion, is a
significant research question” (2003: 144).","[338, 339]"
"This general-singular-plural distinction translates into the minimalist framework by
positing three different features: [individuation], [singular], and [plural]. Following
the morphosyntactic feature geometry proposed by Harley and Ritter (2002), in
order for a form to bear the [singular] or [plural] feature, it must first bear the
[individuation] feature.",[321]

Object
Direct Object
The position of the direct object nouns is best analyzed in relation to the selector
-- a cluster of clitics which consistently occurs to the left of the lexical verb (see
§2.4.2). The direct object may occur: i) immediately before the selector (2.37);
ii) immediately after the selector, in which case the linker is pronounced (2.38);
and iii) immediately before (or as part of) the verb, in which case the linker is
never present (2.39). In the second case, the direct object is no longer indexed as
agreement on the selector (see §2.4.2.1). In the third case, the noun is probably
incorporated into the verb, and is never an argument (see §7.4.1.1).

"4.3.2 Pausa
In slow speech, subject nouns occur with distinguishable post-pause. Defining
pause as “any interval of the oscillographic trace where the amplitude is
indistinguishable from that of the background noise” (Duez 1982: 13) for a
period of 100ms or longer, the following pausa were identified and measured
using the Praat software programme (Boersma &Weenink, 2016).

ilaá (0.2) tám
eyes PAUSE three
“three eyes”However, pausa are not a particularly reliable criterion of wordhood in Gorwaa.
First, most nouns end in a vowel, which, even in slow speech, tend to eliminate
pausa by filling them with residual vocalic sound. Second, object nouns, even
when consonant-final, do not show significant pausa. In (4.12)a), this seems to
be due both to the object noun baahaa ‘hyaena’ being vowel-final, and to the
general tendency of the following selector to be uttered in very close succession
with the object noun. In (4.12)b), this seems to be due both to the object noun
/aaymár ‘food’ ending in a vocalic consonant, as well as the general tendency for
the encapsulated object noun and the following verb to be uttered in very close
succession.",[221]
"2.3.5 An excursus on ideophones
It must be noted that ideophones in Gorwaa do not form a lexical class per se.
Instead, they are distributed throughout the lexical categories of the language. As
such, they will be briefly be examined here as a conclusion to the subsection on
lexical categories.
Gorwaa makes extensive use of ideophones – that is, words which depict their
referent, rather than denote it. As an English example, the verb ‘call’ in the phrase
‘the birds are calling’ denotes the action undertaken by the birds, but the verb
1302. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa
‘tweet’ in the phrase ‘the birds are tweeting’ depicts the action undertaken by the
birds, in that it mimics the sound produced. Idiophones are, therefore, iconic in
nature, and give rise to different subtypes of ideophone according to the subtype of
iconicity: direct, Gestalt, and relative (Dingemanse 2018). Each is examined, with
examples, below.","[130, 131]"
"4.3.1 Orthographic boundaries
The first commonly-cited criterion for identifying a word are orthographic
boundaries. The assumption is that, Gorwaa-speakers who are acquainted with a
writing system which conventionally separates words with spaces (such as
Swahili and English) will generalize this spacing convention to Gorwaa, writing
what they perceive as words with a space before and after. The data used to test
this hypothesis are examples of the Gorwaa language as written by Gorwaaspeakers unacquainted with either formal linguistic analysis, or the standardized
Gorwaa writing system. Throughout the samples of informal Gorwaa
orthographies recorded in the corpus, nouns are consistently separated from2194. Fundamentals: nominal structure and noun stems
other lexical categories by spaces. Examples are provided in (4.9) below. Note
especially the object nouns (na/ay ‘child’ (written NAAY) in (a), and yiikwa
‘cattle’ (written HIKWA) in (b), both of which are realized as distinct
orthographic units.

the residents of the fields of Ayasanda in the process.
Dr. Kathryn Ranhorn helped me to look at Gorwaaland as part of a larger Rift Valley
area, and my work as part of a larger humanist picture.
At the University of Dar es Salaam, my thanks, as always, to my Masters-level
supervisor and current host Dr. Henry Muzale, as well as Dr. Josephat Rugemalira,
who first suggested I work on Gorwaa -- both formidable minds who never allowed
me to forget the primacy of the empirical data above the appeal of a convenient
theory.
At the school of Oriental and African Studies, my thanks to Dr. Martin Orwin and Dr.
Peter Austin, my second and third supervisors, respectively. As for Dr. Lutz Marten,
my first supervisor whose magnanimity, franchise, and patience (derived, it must be
remembered, from the Latin ‘to suffer’) I doubt I shall ever properly repay, I know of
few other people who would make a trip to Kilimanjaro to check in with how their
student is doing -- fewer still who could cut through the complexities of a language
like Gorwaa to determine those fundamental questions that I so badly needed to be
asked.
Thanks are due to the staff at the Endangered Languages Archive, who helped me
turn my data into information, available to virtually anyone, free of charge. The
ability of readers to resolve the Gorwaa material back to the original utterances is a
central feature of this dissertation, and simply would not have been possible7without their expertise in metadata, data management, and the vicissitudes of
technology.
Dr. Soung-U Kim, who read virtually the entire first draft and responded with deeply
useful comments, and Samantha Goodchild, who provided commentary on parts of
the introduction, gave vital alternate viewpoints on organization and content: a
resuscitating breath for an author in a post-draft stupor.
Dr. Hannah Gibson and Dr. Rozenn Guerois, life of the party that was Bantu group,
have been, in academic terms, the older sisters that I never had, and despite both of
their frenetic schedules, neither have ever found themselves too busy to offer
support or guidance. The friendship, hospitality, and help provided by the
remainder of the Bantu group and other hangers-on (as myself), including Dr. Peter
Edelsten, Chiku Lijongwa, Dr. Nancy Kula, Dr. Sheena Shah, and Elisabeth Kerr,
won’t soon be forgotten.
Sections of this dissertation have been presented in various forms at the Aldrich
Interdisciplinary Conference in St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, March 2014; the
SOAS Linguistics Student Research Conference in London, UK, June 2016; the CELC
Postgraduate Workshop, Cambridge, UK, July 2016; CALL 46 in Leiden, the
Netherlands, August 2016; NACAL 45 in Leiden, the Netherlands, June 2017; CALL
47 in Leiden, the Netherlands, August 2017; and the LAGB Meeting in Canterbury,
UK, September 2017. My thanks to the audience members and individuals who
provided detailed feedback. My thanks also to Dr. Jason Merchant, Dr. David Adger,8and Dr. Hagit Borer, each of whom took the time to provide some feedback on
specific parts of the formal analysis.
To Jan and the English countryside, the easy companionship of whom seems to
blend together, I owe many of the happiest memories of my time here.
My mother, father, and younger brother have always believed in the value of my
work, and in my ability to do it. During times when I questioned myself, this proved
the single most valuable kind of support. Thank you.
Needless to say, all errors found in this dissertation are mine, and mine alone.

1.1 Why Gorwaa? Why the noun? Why formalism? A note on motivations.
Gorwaa (ISO 639-3: gow), a South Cushitic language spoken in north-central
Tanzania, is an endangered language, about which very little is known or
available to linguists. Beginning in 2012 and extending to present, I have had the
privilege of spending long periods of time living with speakers of Gorwaa in and
around what may be construed as their traditional homeland of Babati district,
conducting audiovisual documentation of their language. This work is one early
output of that documentary and descriptive fieldwork.
While learning to speak the language (an ongoing feat, it must be admitted),
perhaps one of the most mind-boggling tasks (or group of tasks) was using
nouns correctly. Simply put, as a speaker of English (with some familiarity with
both French (fra) and Swahili (swa)), I found ‘getting the nouns right’ in Gorwaa
very difficult indeed. Four examples of this characteristic difficulty are outlined
below:
TONE: Nouns must be pronounced with the appropriate tone, otherwise they are
either misunderstood or deemed incorrect. The noun aalutumo ‘inheritor ♂’
must therefore be pronounced with low tone, and the noun tlaptumó ‘falcon’
must be pronounced with high tone. Several noun pairs exist whose meaning
differs solely in whether they are produced with low or high tone. Thus, the
word for ‘drum’ is niinga, and the word for ‘pigeon species’ is niingá. The word
for ‘night’ is amsi, versus the proper name Amsí (typically given to a boy or girl
born at night).","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

merged with an SFX2. Most nouns also contain a linker morpheme, but this is not
essential to the syntactic identity of the noun. As will be argued in Chapter 7, linkers
are not present in incorporation constructions, making them, to some degree, nonessential to the categorial identity of the noun. SFX2, however, must be present in
order for a noun to be a noun.",[325]

The first step in treating this suffix is a discussion of gender, building on the
introduction given in §2.3.1.2. Presentation of the data follows, focusing on the3877. The linker
contexts in which the linker occurs and those in which it does not. The
remainder of the chapter draws on this data, as well as some more challenging
cases in order to motivate a syntactic analysis of the linker as a determiner
obligatory on all nouns with reference, whose pronunciation is
morphophonologically conditioned.","[387, 388]"
"2.3.2.2 Verbal inflection
The Gorwaa verb may inflect for person, gender, and number, tense, and mood,
which will be examined below.
Person, gender, and number
It is important to distinguish pronominal subjects (for which verbs agree for person
and number) from nominal subjects (i.e. for which verbs agree for gender). We will
first examine verbal inflection for pronominal subjects, and then examine nominal
subjects.
Pronominal subjects
There are at least 6 verbal paradigms, which each inflect differently for person.

"Encapsulation and change in valency
Note also that when the object argument is located between the selector and the
verb (a configuration known as ‘encapsulation’ (e.g. Whiteley 1958, Kießling 2007)),
it is not marked on the selector. That is to say, a selector which otherwise would
have marked an A and a P for a transitive verb (2.156)a), will now only mark one
argument. This argument will be marked as if it were S, and therefore as if the1452. A grammatical sketch of Gorwaa
clause were intransitive (2.156)b).","[145, 146]"
"4287. The linker
It is difficult to see how Kramer’s proposal would work here (even by increasing
Kramer’s n heads to five in order to accommodate uninterpretable N gender).
The first step would be, inevitably, replacing individual gendered suffixes at n
with paradigms, within which the five gender values (n i[F] and n i[M], and n
u[F], n u[M], and n u[N]) would be realized post-Spellout. But even having
adopted this mechanism, the approach fails to capture the precise nature of how
semantic gender ‘overrides’ grammatical gender. As may be seen in (7.38),
semantic override is accomplished in Kramer’s analysis as a process by which an
entirely different suffix is merged with the root (one with interpretable gender,
rather than uninterpretable). In fact, the process is not one of ‘override’ at all, as
the structures involve entirely different formatives. The motivation for this
analysis is understandable: the majority of the proposed n morphemes in
Amharic are formally identical (-∅ in most cases, no matter the feature values).
In a language like Gorwaa, where a noun can retain its suffix’s (phonetic)
identity, but assume the biological sex of the referent (as in cases discussed in
§7.4.2.2), the argument that the head at n has been changed becomes, empirically
speaking, less sound.","[428, 429]"
"6.6.2 Summary
This subsection concludes two chapters which focus on the suffix. Where chapter
five treated the regular characteristics of the suffix, the current chapter treated the
listed characteristics. Based on a detailed analysis of the paradigmatic patterns of
Gorwaa, this work espouses the view that it is the paradigm itself which acts as a
grammatical formative, within which suffixes (grammatical primitives lacking in
syntactic features) are arranged. It is the structure of the paradigm itself which
dictates what meanings these suffixes will be realized with. Post-syntactically,
suffixes are realized with a diacritic gender feature -- in order for this gender feature
to affect morphosyntactic agreement operations, Agree must be a post-syntactic
operation.",[384]

3.2.2.2 Agree
Agree values unvalued inflectional features. In order for agree to apply, both
syntactic objects must be in a relationship of c-command. Using (3.5) as an
example, because vTRANS and VP examine finches are siblings, and both examine
and finches are descendants of VP examine finches, a relationship called ccommand exists between the vTRANS and finches: vTRANS c-commands finches, and
finches is c-commanded by vTRANS.

communities are in contact in extreme southern communities, such as Bereko.
Again, because the majority of Alagwa are Muslim, contemporary contact
between Gorwaa and Alagwa communities is not as extensive as that between
Gorwaa and Iraqw.
Evidence from the very recent past (perhaps only one or two generations) shows
that contact between Gorwaa speakers and speakers of the various Datooga
dialects was very strong. Indeed, in addition to the 3 Gorwaa consultants who
considered themselves fluent in Datooga, at least 13 Gorwaa consultants
reported that Datooga was either the first or second language of one or both of
their parents (see Appendix A). The Gorwaa still rely on Datooga traders for the
metalwork bracelets worn by many Gorwaa people following marriage, as well
as for soda harvested from the alkaline Lake Balangida.
Within Gorwaaland itself, speakers are (and historically have been) highly
mobile. Because of strict rules regarding intermarriage, it was very common for
women to marry into families in villages quite distant from their own. More
recently, the concentration of services in a handful of communities has resulted
in high levels of movement from one area to another: secondary-level students
may live in a different community from their families during term time, and
expecting mothers commonly travel from rural areas to Babati in order to give
birth in the larger hospitals. The recent improvements in roads and construction
of bridges will only further facilitate this tendency.","[47, 48]"

2.1 Introduction
Among other things, the previous chapter discussed some of the wider context
(historical, cultural, sociolinguistic) in which the Gorwaa language exists (see
§1.2), as well as the research methodology used during data collection (see §1.3).
What follows is a preliminary sketch of Gorwaa, written with two central
purposes in mind. First, the sketch provides descriptive material on the main
points of Gorwaa grammar: both the most cross-linguistically common features,
as well as those most peculiar to the language. As a language with no previous
description, this is meant as an empirical contribution to understanding the
language in general. Second, the sketch ought to ground the reader in a basic
understanding of the noun phrase and associated phenomena such as agreement
– the theoretical and analytical focus of the thesis.
The sketch begins with an overview of Gorwaa phonetics and phonology (§2.2).
It is followed by a presentation of the lexical categories of the language (nouns,
verbs, adjectives, adverbs), with an excursionary remark on ideophone (§2.3).
Next, the fuctional categories (determiners, selectors, and pronouns) are
examined (§2.4).","[72, 73]"
"411. Introduction
the economy to a capitalist model, which began in 1986. Today, while many
Gorwaa speaking children do attend school, education may be disrupted or not
completed depending on the economic fortunes of the family. Illiteracy among
young adults is not uncommon. Literate Gorwaa speakers will be literate in
Swahili (which employs the Roman alphabet), and possibly English.
In 1977, an Iraqw translation of the Old Testament was produced by the
Tanzania Bible Society which employed a writing system developed principally
by the Catholic mission at Tlawi. As an appendix, a glossary of Gorwaa terms
were included in order to make the book useable by the Gorwaa speaking
Christian community as well. Though the book (nor Gorwaa-language worship)
never became particularly widespread, it did establish the Iraqw writing system
as the standard for Gorwaa as well. With that said, a great diversity of nonstandard writing conventions are in use (e.g. [20150815m], [20150920n],
[20151001z], [20151127g], and [20151127h]), and the language is not very
commonly seen in written form.
In addition to the Gorwaa of everyday interaction, several specific genres of
Gorwaa also exist. Though these have not been given enough attention so as to
be discussed in any great detail, they will briefly mentioned below.
Riddles, a common way of passing the time following the evening meal and
before bed, are often based on guessing the identity of a cryptic description. A
teller will pose their riddle, and others will provide a guess. If nobody guesses
correctly, the riddle either goes unanswered, or may be ‘bought’ from the teller421. Introduction
by offering a village, town, or city (I once observed a particularly good riddle sell
in exchange for all of Canada).

[20130206b_20150720b.3-7]
My calabash is small,
It has two mouths,
And has much oil that never runs out.
[Answer: the nose]
Another speech genre is the firoo: a litany-like pronouncement, usually asking
for the intercession of the indigenous god Loo’aa. The contents of the firoo
seems relatively variable, and I have yet to observe the more formulaic slufay as
described for Iraqw (Thornton 1977, Wada 1978, Kamera 1987/1988, Beck &
Mous 2014).
As a genre, Gorwaa song represents a diverse array of material, often associated
with particular events or occasions. Wedding songs (e.g. [20160229n]), dancing
songs (e.g. [20160120h]), songs of praise and songs of victory (e.g. [20151004f]),
farming songs (e.g. [20150903f]), and circumcision songs (e.g. [20151202a]) are
all examples which have been recorded. Certain songs are typically only sung by
men, such as some of the Mandaa songs (e.g. [20160927c]), and certain songs are
typically only sung by women (e.g. [20160225t]).

may also be wholly different. Typical themes include highly poetic entreaties to
lovers, descriptions of parties and their attendees, as well as historical events.
Songs are often performed unaccompanied, but may also be sung along with431. Introduction
music from the seense (lute/guitar, see e.g. [20160127o], [20160217o],
[20160217zc]), irimba (mbira, thumb piano, see e.g. [20160210j], [20160217d],

[20161112d], [20161112e], [20161112w-z]), foori (flute, see e.g. [20160217j],
[20161113f], [20160217ze]), and the niinga (drum, see e.g. [20151004d],
[20151001w]). To date, over 250 recordings of Gorwaa songs have been made.
The mystical monologues (or perhaps dialogues) into which traditional doctors
enter during the performance of various rites represent another genre of speech.
Due to the secretive nature of this type of speech, the only recorded examples
are that of the diviner reading stones in order to determine a client’s prospects
(e.g. [20151003d-e], [20151211c-e]). Cursory examination shows these sessions
are highly structured, and feature specialized vocabulary.
1.2.3.3 Language attitudes
As with language use, no dedicated survey of language attitudes has been
undertaken for Gorwaa, and as such, the generalizations made here are tentative.
Overall, there appears to be a rather sharp divide in language attitudes,
particularly in terms of age, as well as identification with a rural versus urban
way of life. Typically, older Gorwaa speakers from rural areas tend to be most
enthusiastic about their language, seeing it as useful in the widest range of
domains, and valuable as a badge of a culture with which they strongly identify.
Younger Gorwaa speakers in more urban areas tend to view Gorwaa as being
less useful in day-to-day life, and, in some cases, tend to be somewhat
embarrassed to be heard speaking Gorwaa, especially when non-Gorwaa
speakers are present. A large proportion of younger speakers have gone so far441. Introduction
as to eliminate the concept of Gorwaa altogether, in favour of the exonym
‘Mbulu’. Mbulu, name of the largest Iraqw settlement, has recently emerged to
subsume both the Iraqw and the Gorwaa peoples, cultures, and languages, and is
perhaps the most common way for both Gorwaa and Iraqw youth to refer to
themselves. Resultantly, many young Gorwaa speakers typically refer to
themselves as of Mbulu ethnicity, and to the language which they speak as Mbulu
or Kimbulu. Superficially, this simply represents the adoption of a new title, as
the language which speakers use remains the same. In the longer-term this
perhaps represents a larger shift to Iraqw, as the Gorwaa are most certainly the
minority within this neo-ethnicity.
With that said, there has been considerable interest from Gorwaa speakers of all
ages in the work surrounding the current Gorwaa language documentation, with
the contribution of some (considerably elderly) consultants resulting in a large
body of data (such as songs, traditional justice, and uncommon or archaic
vocabulary) being collected in a relatively short period of time. Younger
speakers directly involved in the translation and transcription of the material
have become researchers in their own right, and are taking increasing ownership
of the project, and ultimately the documentation and description of their own
culture. Such energy would seem to suggest that those exposed to the full
richness of the language tend to approach it with new esteem, and may be a
route to explore should the speaker community ever desire to further valorize
Gorwaa.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"To handle cases of where biological sex affects morphological agreement, appeal
was made to the null referential pronoun R (Williams (1981), Higginbotham (1985),
and Grimshaw (1990)). Merged as external argument to nP, R may serve as an
intervener in agreement between D and (m-)gender features on n. As an
afterthought, it was briefly explained that, for Gorwaa, this approach seemed
preferable to that of Kramer (2014), but in order to decide whether an analysis like4518. Conclusion
this one could, in fact, handle Kramer’s Amharic data equally as well as Gorwaa,
more detailed examination of Amharic is necessary.","[451, 452]"
"3.4 Distributed Morphology
In the preceding two subsections, the syntax was introduced as the mechanism
which gives lexical elements structure. As such, from an inchoate numeration
such as (3.2) emerges a structured clause Charles examines finches on the
Galapagos. Our topic, of course, is the noun. What has been represented in the
examples thus far as a single lexical element, nouns are, in fact, considerably
more complex than this. Consider the noun finches: what was above represented
as a single lexical element may easily be subdivided into at least two identifiable
elements: finch, and the pluralizing element -s. Furthermore, such sub-word2073. The theoretical framework
elements exhibit restrictions on ordering: *es-finch is as meaningless a
correspondent to finch-es as *examines finches Charles on the Galapagos is to
Charles examines finches on the Galapagos. It is at this point that appeal will be
made to Distributed Morphology.","[207, 208]"

Mass nouns refer to uncountable entities of undifferentiated consistency. They
differ from count nouns in that they cannot be modified by numerals. Gorwaa
masses include mud (ba/i), water (maa’ay), and knowledge (qeeru) as well as
entities less commonly construed as mass, including ideas (hasloo), footprints
(kala/a), and flames (duru’i).
Some, but not all, mass nouns may be pluralized. The result is a new mass noun
with a distributive meaning (i.e. the substance of the mass in different places, or at
different instances of time).

Several singular nouns in Gorwaa do not have a plural form, including dawri ‘sky’,
hoomoo ‘full moon’, and serkaari ‘central government’. Several plural nouns do not
have a singular form, including moro’ó ‘menses’, and gwa/ateema’ ‘light’.
Locational nouns
Locational nouns serve a prepositional function. Typically derived from common
nouns (and very often body parts), they may occur postverbally as verb phrase
adjuncts, and, when used with the prepositions ay (lative) and wa (ablative), serve
to add locational precision. Some locational nouns are highly selective, and must
follow other specific locational nouns. Others may occur in any order. Table 2.5

Gorwaa is a South Cushitic language of Tanzania whose nouns are particularly
complex. Based on detailed documentation of the language (most of which is openly
accessible for consultation in an online archive (Harvey 2017)), this dissertation
provides a first description of Gorwaa grammar, with a particular focus on the
noun. Additionally, a grammatical analysis of Gorwaa nouns is developed using the
Distributed Morphology architecture and Minimalist syntax. This offers a different
perspective from the typically functional analyses available for South Cushitic
languages thus far.
Following a general sketch of Gorwaa grammar, as well as a brief introduction into
the theoretical framework, each subsequent chapter of the dissertation focuses on
one subpart of the noun and its morphosyntactic characteristics. Composed of
several identifiable subparts (e.g. the stem, the suffix, and the linker), each of which
in turn presents a rich array of variants, the Gorwaa noun is an ideal entry point for
inquiry into Gorwaa as a system, as adequate explanation of nouns in this language
touches on all the major modalities of grammar (phonology, morphosyntax,
semantics, and pragmatics).
Syntactically, the stem is formed of a root, whose characteristics (phonetic,
semantic, and categorial) are determined by the larger syntactic structure in which
it is found. Distinguished by two broad groups of morphosyntactic characteristics
(those which are regular and those which are listed), the suffix is formed of
(maximally) three syntactic heads: Cl (classifier), # (quantifier), and n (‘little n’). In
order to bear a number value (Sg or Pl), nouns must be classified and quantified.
Nouns unvalued for number (‘general’ number) are neither classified nor quantified.
The little n head is the site of the paradigm, itself established as a grammatical
formative realized as a specific suffix through instructions
post-Spellout. Grammatical gender is a diacritic feature, also realized post-Spellout,
making Agree a necessarily post-Spellout operation (cf. Bobaljik 2008). The linker is
agreement morphology on the syntactic head D. Cases of mismatch between the
form taken by the linker and the gender value of n represents the interpretable
(semantic) features of the referent of the noun (itself the external argument of n),
intervening in agreement relations between D and n. This mechanism is extended
to account for adjectival number agreement on nouns of general number.","[1, 2, 3]"
"In Icelandic (isl; Iceland), there exist a series of constructions in which the
morphological case assigned to the subject is not nominative. This is known in the
literature as quirky case. One such construction occurs with experiencer predicates,
in which the subject is assigned dative case.
(6.35) QUIRKY CASE IN ICELANDIC (FROM BOBALJIK (2008: 298)
a. Jóni
líkuðu þessir sokkar
Jon.DAT like.Pl these socks.NOM
“Jon likes these socks.”
(from Jónsson 1996: 143)
b. Það líkuðu einhverjum þessir sokkar
EXPL liked.Pl someone.DAT these socks.NOM
“Someone liked these socks.”
(from Jónsson 1996: 153)
It is shown that, though morphologically marked for dative case, these quirky
subjects are, by all criteria, grammatical subjects. Because of this, it is concluded
that the system responsible for assigning structural case (i.e. case according to
grammatical function), and that responsible for assigning morphological case are
different. In languages such as German and Russian, the system of morphological
case “tracks [case based on grammatical function] fairly neatly” (303). In the case of
Icelandic, the two systems do not coincide so neatly, hence the occurrence of quirky
case.",[379]
