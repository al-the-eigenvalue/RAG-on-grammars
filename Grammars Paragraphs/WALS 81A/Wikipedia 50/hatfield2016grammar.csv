"It is also possible for object noun phrases to follow the verb, as in (10) and (11), though
this order also seems to be very uncommon.

3SG.MAs noted above, both subject and object normally precede the verb and only rarely
does the object precede the subject. Sentences where both subject and object are
nominal (as opposed to pronominal) and where they are the same in number and
gender are considered unambiguous. For example, (14), where both subject and object
are masculine singular, is judged to allow only one interpretation, one where the first
noun phrase is subject and the second one object.

tell-PAST2-3SG.MOn the other hand, if there is little risk of ambiguity, the object will occasionally precede
the subject. For example, (15) is a text example employing OSV word order, where there
is little chance of ambiguity since it is not likely that the crab took the men.

Subject pronouns are optional, but are in fact often present. In the first thirty
sentences in the text given in story A.1 in Appendix A, there are twelve clauses with
248personal pronouns as subject, one clause with a demonstrative pronoun as subject and
twelve clauses where there is no overt noun phrase functioning as subject. However,
whether a pronoun occurs or not in these thirty sentences is almost entirely predictable
from whether the next verb is finite or not: in most of the examples where the verb is
finite (where the verb codes the person, number and gender of the subject), a subject
pronoun is not used, while in most of the sentences where the verb is nonfinite (the
verb does not bear a subject suffix), the pronoun is used. The examples in (16) and (17)
illustrate the two possibilities. In (16), the verb bears a 3DU subject suffix and there is no
subject pronoun, while in (17), the verb occurs with only the realis clitic and there is a
3DU subject pronoun fu.

The only exception to this pattern in these thirty sentences is given in (18), where both
clauses contain both subject pronouns and subject suffixes on the verb.

use of pronouns here, despite the subject suffix on the verb.","[263, 264, 265, 266]"
"70845.14 Noun Phrase Structure
The most frequent order of constituents within simple noun phrases is schematized
in (345).8
(345)Noun Phrase = (Det/Dem/Poss/Num/PossNP) + (noun) + (AdjP) + (Poss/Det)
+ (noun phrase clitic) + (Dem/[Num + noun phrase clitic])The formula in (345) does not include relative clauses (see ยง5.9), which always precede
the noun, or relational noun phrase modifiers of nouns, which either precede or follow
the noun (see below) or adnominal interrogative words; it is not clear how these are
ordered with respect to other modifiers of nouns. All of the constituents in (345) are
optional since one can have noun phrases consisting only of nouns and noun phrases
lacking nouns. Where possibilities are indicated as alternatives, namely with8The formula in (345) and the labels on examples below use the following abbreviation:
Det
determiner
Dem
demonstrative
Poss
possessive pronoun
PossNP nominal possessor plus optional possessive pronoun
Num
numeral
Adjp
adjective phrase200'(Det/Dem/Poss/Num/PossNP)', '(Dem/Num)' and '(Poss/Det)', it is not clear whether
there is a preferred order.
An example containing many of the constituents in a noun phrase is given in (346).
(346) Dem + Det + N + AdjP + Poss + noun phrase clitic

do-VNEGon
NEG 1SGDETsauwo samba ro-ko=r
work
big
3SG.M-POSS=M
ELICI didn't do this big job of his. I did this job.
Example (347) shows how postnominal demonstratives are different from
postnominal possessive pronouns, the latter illustrated above in (346): in (346), the
noun phrase clitic attaches to the possessive pronoun, while in (347), it attaches to the
adjective rather than the demonstrative.
(347) N + A + noun phrase clitic + Dem

back=LOCsiri-m-r
die-PAST2-3SG.Mtama welmbe=r ora
man true=M
DIST-M-EMPkara
6028
indeedSo he died again, that honest man.
Example (348) shows how numerals are like demonstratives and unlike possessive
pronouns in that the noun phrase clitic attaches to the word preceding the numeral.","[216, 217]"
"285A third type of serial verb construction involves a very tight connection between the
two verbs and does not allow individual verbs to combine with their own object or
adverb. In fact, these might be considered compound verbs. Examples are given in (157)
and (158).
(157) ru
ka
afa=r
3SG.M REAL father=M
He waits for [his] father.[rusu
[sit(158) num tawa=s
ka
[susu
1PL
woman=F REAL [stand
We are waiting for the woman.kuna]-ya-r
ELIC
wait]-PRES-3SG.Mkuna]-ya-num
wait]-PRES-1PLELICWith these compound verb serial verb constructions, it is less clear that the two verbs
denote separate subevents of a single event. Rather than denote different aspects of a
single event. For example, in (158), the standing and waiting are not really different
subevents, but rather two aspects of a single event.
Note that the order of the two verbs in these compound verb constructions is not
always fixed. Example (159) has the same meaning as (157) above, but with the verbs in
reverse order But again, the verbal inflections still occur only on the second verb.
(159) ru
ka
afa=r
3SG.M REAL father=M
He waits for [his] father.[kuna rusu]-ya-r

"A GRAMMAR OF MEHEK
by
Adam Hatfield
June 1, 2016A dissertation submitted to the
Faculty of the Graduate School of
the University at Buffalo, State University of New York
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
degree of
Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of LinguisticsAcknowledgements
The work in this dissertation was made possible by two grants from the National
Science Foundation (NSF). The first grant was under Matthew Dryer, my major
professor. The second grant was an NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant, BCS1263554,
designed to allow for additional data collection. Below are lists of the main consultants
who provided data, time, generosity and hospitality to me while learning Mehek. The
primary consultants are the ones who provided ongoing and/or daily time for long
periods. The secondary consultants provided large amounts of data over a fixed time
period, either hours or multiple times over several days. In addition to those listed
below, there were well over 50 different people who gave different kinds of language
data. Their time and assistance are graciously appreciated. I would also like to thank the
members of my dissertation committee (listed below), and the faculty, staff and
students of the Linguistics Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

Each glossed example used in this grammar is followed by a four digit number or
the letters โELICโ or โOVHโ. For numbers, the first digit represents which of the seven
notebooks the data are recorded in and the last three digits represent the page or story
number from that notebook. The letters โELICโ are short for โelicitationโ and represent
an example from direct elicitation. The letters โOVHโ are short for โoverheardโ and
represent an example heard in natural speech.
Proper names (including those for people, plants and animals) are glossed in English
with the same word used in Mehek where an English or Tok Pisin equivalent does not
exist.xvAbstract
This is a grammar which provides a detailed linguistic description of the phonology,
morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of the Mehek language
and its speakers. Mehek is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea by approximately
6300 people. It belongs to the Sepik language family, Tama branch. The theoretical
background employed is Basic Linguistic Theory. Mehek shares general features with
many non-Austronesian Papuan languages, including: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; agglutinative verbal morphology; and the
morphology of other word classes is relatively simple.xviChapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview
Mehek (ISO code nux) is a language of the Tama branch of the Sepik family spoken
in Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea. There are approximately 6300 speakers
(Gordon 2005) spread out over an area of roughly 65 square miles. The data for this
study were gathered in three field trips during the summers of 2010, 2012 and 2014.
The total length of the trips was nine months and time was spent in each of the Mehekspeaking villages, though the primary location was the village of Wilwil (see ยง2.1 below).
There is no prior published grammatical information on Mehek, though some
neighboring languages have had partial Bible translations done or a grammatical sketch
done.
The goal of the present grammar is to provide a detailed linguistic description of the
phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of Mehek
and its speakers. In the present chapter, information on the language and speakers is
given and the following areas will be discussed: linguistic scene and language vitality
(ยง1.1), genetic classification of Mehek (ยง1.2), previous research (ยง1.3), dialects (ยง1.4),
fieldwork (ยง1.5) and theoretical background (ยง1.6). Chapter 2 will discuss topics relevant
to culture and environment. After that, chapter 3 will provide a brief grammatical sketch
of the language and its primary features. Chapters 4-11 will discuss linguistic topics of
the language, specifically: phonology (chapter 4), word classes (chapter 5), nouns and1noun phrases (chapter 6), verbs and verb phrases (chapter 7), clause types (chapter 8),
clausal relations (chapter 9), discourse and paralanguage (chapter 10), and lexical fields
(chapter 11). Following these chapters are several appendices of additional information
and reference. These include sample texts (Appendix A); multi-lingual dictionaries:
Mehek-English-Tok Pisin (Appendix B), English-Mehek (Appendix C), and Tok PisinMehek (Appendix D); lists of animal and plant Species (Appendix E); thematic vocabulary
(Appendix F); personal name index (Appendix G); names, songs and whistles (Appendix
H); place and clan names (Appendix I); and garamut drum beats (Appendix J).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"1.1 The Linguistic Scene and Language Vitality
Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse country in the world (Gordon
2005). There are more than 800 languages spoken in the country, and more than 1000
spoken on the island of New Guinea. These languages are still not well documented and
language family groupings are often tenuous and disputed. The primary linguistic
grouping in Papua New Guinea is the โTrans-New Guineaโ language family, which
contains almost 500 languages. With more documentation, many smaller family
groupings have been established, though these are often uncertain as well. The Sepik
family to which Mehek belongs is one of these smaller families.
Languages of Papua New Guinea have some broad features in common, many of
which Mehek shares. These shared features include: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; complex, agglutinative verbal morphology2(though Mehek verbal morphology is not overly complex); and the morphology of other
word classes is usually simpler. Beyond these generalizations, it is difficult to otherwise
group all (or even most) languages of Papua New Guinea based on any specific criteria.
The origin of the name of the Mehek language is unknown, though it does follow
the naming pattern of many other languages in the immediate geographical area, up to
the Torricelli Mountain Range. This is a practice of the Lumi District administration
wherein languages are named after their word for 'no'. (Laycock 1968) The name is
sometimes pronounced without the /h/ or instead with a glottal stop [mษษk] or [mษษษk].
In careful speech, it is sometimes pronounced with both, [mษhษษษk]. The people, for the
most part, adhere to this practice and call their own language Mehek or Mehek Suma
'Mehek Language'. According to Ethnologue (Gordon 2005), it is also known as
Indinogosima, Driafleisuma and Nuku. The former two names have been attested from
some speakers. Suma is a word meaning 'voice' and the words indi numgo are a
demonstrative and possessive pronoun meaning 'our'. The term driaflei is an erroneous
rendition of dinafle, 'one'. Naming the language Nuku, after the most prominent village
where it is spoken, is another common naming practice in the area, though typical of
languages that are only spoken in one village (Laycock 1968). This is an exonym rather
than a term the speakers use for their own language.
The language is currently still used on a daily basis by most of the adult speakers.
Their attitudes towards the language are good, though it is only irregularly transmitted3to children. Despite this, most children primarily have a passive understanding of the
language and do not actively use it except in limited form with adults. Amongst each
other, children (roughly, those under the age of about 20), speak Tok Pisin almost
exclusively. See ยง2.4.3 for more information on intergenerational transmission.
Tok Pisin is a creole language spoken by most people within Papua New Guinea. Its
lexifier language is primarily English, though many core vocabulary items come from
nearby Melanesian languages (primarily Malay and Tolai) as well as German. Tok Pisin is
spoken by all but the most elderly and English is spoken only by those who have had
schooling beyond the sixth grade. Children (ages approximately <14) do not have as
great a command of Mehek as do adults, particularly in the lexical domain. They do not
speak it as often or as readily as adults, though they do understand it and can respond
to basic utterances. The use of Tok Pisin in the schools is likely the reason that children
use Tok Pisin in more situations than adults. Because children seem to be using Tok Pisin
more than Mehek, the youngest generation will likely speak Tok Pisin to their children
even more than their parents currently do. This may lead to the decline in the vitality of
Mehek in the coming generations. See ยง9.12 for more information on the influence of
Tok Pisin on Mehek.","[18, 19, 20]"

7.0 Introduction
This chapter discusses the fundamentals of clause structure. It begins with
discussion of subjects and objects (ยง7.1), and then discusses the mood particles (ยง7.2),
adjuncts and adverbs (ยง7.3), serial-verb constructions (ยง7.4), clauses with nonverbal
predicates (ยง7.5), passive clauses (ยง7.6), interrogative sentences (ยง7.7), negation (ยง7.8),
clauses with the word erka 'want' (ยง7.9), light verbs (ยง7.10), and repetition (ยง7.11). For
information on additional clause types which only occur in complex sentences, see
Chapter 8. The general structure of clauses is given in (1).
(1) Clause = subject + (mood particle) + (direct object) + (indirect object) + verb
An example sentence illustrating the formula in (1) is given in (2).

give-PAST2-3SG.MBefore discussing subjects and objects, it is necessary to briefly discuss the
terminology. Subjects are those constituents with which the main, finite verb shows
agreement (see ยง6.1 - ยง6.4). Objecst are those constituents which are (or could be)
represented by an object pronominal form (see ยง5.4.2). The terms direct object and
indirect object are used primarily as semantic labels; there are no clear grammatical
differences between the two types of object. I refer to the recipient-like constituents in245a ditransitive clause as indirect objects and I refer to objects that are not indirect objects
as direct objects.","[260, 261, 262]"
"Nominal subjects and objects are distinguished when both occur before the verb, in
that the subject normally comes first. While the default order is for the verb to occur at
the end of clauses, it is possible for various elements to follow the verb. Subjects
occasionally follow the verb as in (5) to (8), though this may be a type of afterthought
construction.

dependency status of the second clause to the first. (This is real-world, rather than
grammatical dependency.) The first type listed, conjunction, merely requires the
juxtaposition of the two clauses and no further ordering or dependency is implied
(though these may both be implied by context). Going down the list, the different clause
types impose restrictions, first on the temporal relationship, then on the dependency
status of the second clause. The final type listed, conditional, requires not only a
temporal sequence and a dependency relationship, but the further requirement that the
first clause itself may not actually occur.
The syntax for the clausal particles yombo 'simultaneous', yungu 'dependent', and
rokor 'causal' relationships is similar. Unlike the verbal aspectual particles (ยง7.2), these
particles are not affixes, but are instead separate words with their own stress and (in
some cases), capable of taking their own agreement markers. As for the syntax of the
clauses themselves, in the default, unmarked context, they each require the verb
immediately preceding to have no inflection and to end in the gerundial suffix โm (see
ยง8.3.3). It is also possible for the preceding verb to have no inflection when imperative,
as well as the conditional marker if the speaker wishes to emphasize that the action has
not yet happened. The syntax of the two clauses linked by a particle is the same in the
case of all three. These cases are summarized in Table 48 below. The abbreviations used
include V for verb and INFL for full verbal inflection.","[357, 358]"
"4046It is the lack of any verbal morphology and the lack of the obligatory mood particle
which distinguishes a command from a statement (see ยง7.2). Examples (47) and (48)
express a similar meaning, the former being a command and the latter being a
statement.

"41910.2 Colors
The most common color terms follow the hierarchy established by Berlin and Kay (1969). In
order to qualify as โbasic color termsโ, they must meet the following criteria: be monomorphemic, in common use, apply to many objects, and not be subsumed under another color.
There is a hierarchy proposed for color terms in which terms to the right of the hierarchy
will only be present in a language if all the terms to the left are present. Mehek has eight color
terms which are given in (1). There are no terms for 'pink', 'purple', or 'gray', though the term
solka can be applied to gray hair and certain shades of gray close to brown.
(1) [black, white] > [red] > [green, yellow] >
[kur, gamu] > [kasa] > [kulfo, okwe] >
[blue] > [brown] > [orange] pink
[gurmbo] > [solka] > [kwesu]; gai/ purple

describe the color blue without use of the word gurmbo.

Though less common (due to the ease of simply incorporating Tok Pisin words),
Mehek speakers often use Mehek words or expressions for meanings associated with
western culture and hence meanings not expressed in traditional Mehek, especially by
metaphorical extension of Mehek words. There are not many common examples, and
even those listed in Table 59 are often simply replaced with the Tok Pisin equivalent.

an appropriate Mehek equivalent for a Tok Pisin concept to avoid having too many Tok
Pisin words in their speech. This appears to be mainly because they are making a
conscious effort to preserve Mehek language and culture.
9.12.2 Code Switching
In addition to the single lexical items that frequently make their way into speech,
there are many instances where grammatical particles from Mehek make their way into
speech that is primarily Tok Pisin, or where Mehek verbs head phrases which are
otherwise completely Tok Pisin. Most of the time, a given conversation will take place
mostly in Mehek, with occasional Tok Pisin lexical items sprinkled throughout. The
reverse is less common, but does occur, particularly with cultural items or practices
which Tok Pisin does not have a word for or has a cumbersome phrase rather than a
single lexical item. Code switching, by distinction, is when grammatical elements from
one language interact with the other. This mostly happens with verbs and also
sometimes discourse particles, such as klei. In the case of verbs, if the utterance is
primarily Mehek, the Tok Pisin verb will occur at the end of the clause as required by
Mehek grammar, despite the fact that Tok Pisin constituent order is usually SVO.
However, the reverse does not hold. When an utterance is primarily Tok Pisin, the
Mehek verb, which will take the appropriate tense and person agreement for the clause,412still occurs at the end of the clause. In each of the overheard examples below, the Tok
Pisin word and its gloss are in bold, to simplify the distinction between the two
languages. Examples (48) to (53) are overheard utterances with this kind of code
switching.

Except in cases of complete reduplication (R), there can be a change of consonant
from the first word to the second (C) or of vowel (V and V*). In the case of a vowel
change, in most cases, the second word has a lower vowel than in the first word (V). In a
few instances, the second vowel has the same height, but is further back (V*). The
commonality between these is that the vowel which changes is always a high or midfront vowel in the first word and is either lowered or backed in the second. There are
also a few forms which have a common variant form which may have a different type of
change. These are listed in parenthesis.
Most of the parts of the following ideophonic adverbs do not occur outside these
combinations as independent morphemes; these only occur in the combinations listed
in Table 44. However, those marked with an asterisk have parts that can appear as
independent morphemes. When they do, they are nouns or verbs, but not adverbs.","[288, 289]"

Table 53: Mehek Deaf Signs403The basic word order of Mehek sign language follows that of spoken Mehek, i.e.
SOV. This must be obeyed as there are not any grammatical signs to connect each sign
to its grammatical role. Often, there is a preparatory clause which sets the stage for the
specific clause which is to follow. For example, to express the concept: โa man and
woman foughtโ, there would be an introductory clause showing the relative heights of
the participants. A flat hand parallel to the ground would be held low, then higher to
show the heights of the participants. This is a standardized way to indicate a woman and
a man. Following that, the signs for man, woman, and fight in that order would be given
to give the specifics of the encounter. The very same introductory clause could also
serve to precede โa child and her mother went to the gardenโ. In that case, the signs
that would follow would be: child, mother, garden, go. No sign for possession is used.","[418, 419, 420]"
"I.1 Place Names
The numbering system here corresponds to the maps in ยง2.1.2. The general
principal behind the numbering is ordering from north to south. The main villages are
listed in this order and the numbers within each village increase generally from north to
south. The physical layout of each village precludes a strictly north-to-south ordering;
however, when walking along a particular path, the villages will occur in the order listed.
These lists are accurate as of 2014, though due to the practice of abandoning some
tracts of land in favor of others, it may not reflect the exact layout at any given time in
the future. The micro-villages of Nuku are not numbered because the traditional village
of Nuku no longer exists. As it has developed into a larger area with government offices
and an airstrip, most of the traditional tracts of land have been lost to these common
areas. While there are many people continuing to live at Nuku near their traditional
lands, many of the residents are transplants from other areas. Because of this, the
traditional layout and naming scheme of the village is being lost. One consultant was
able to provide several names of micro-villages which had been occupied in the past.
These are listed in simple alphabetical order.",[621]

"2837.4 Serial-Verb Constructions
Mehek frequently uses serial verb constructions, with two or more verbs in what
appears to be a single clause. A complete serial-verb utterance itself stands as a single
macro-event while certain groups of verbs within the macro-event constitute subevents. They can be quite complex and often have far more than two verbs. Example
(153) contains nine verbs out of thirteen words, though serial constructions are not
usually nearly so complex.

go.back-PAST2-3DUWe two went up there to clear the garden, came down to cut
grass, started a fire, then went back down to go home.
All but the last verb in serial verb constructions is uninflected, though they can host
the realis clitic, as in wi=ka 'go.up=REAL' in (99). The tense/mood/aspect suffixes on the
last verb in the serial verb construction are interpreted as applying to all verbs in the
construction. What this means is that they will all share the same subject. They may,
however, each combine with other clausal constituents, like object noun phrases and
adverbs. For example, the verb talma 'start' in (153) is preceded by an object noun
phrase kiri 'fire', which is object of just this verb, no other verb in the serial verb
construction. When there is a sequence of events that have different subjects, however,284it is not possible to use a serial construction. Separate finite verbs must be used, as in
(154).

It is possible to distinguish different sorts of serial verb constructions in terms of
the tightness of the combination. As noted above, it is possible for the realis mood
particle ka to occur multiple times within a serial verb construction. However, when ka
occurs more than once, the connection between the units marked by ka seems looser,
as in (155), where the occurrence of =ka on rusu 'sit' seems to signal a looser connection
between the two verbs, due to the fact that both action are possible independent of
each other. That is, 'sitting' and 'talking' do not have to co-occur.

8.0 Introduction
This chapter discusses several types of complex sentences, ones containing more
than one clause. These are those types where two clauses have some relationship to
each other and have a syntactic means of indicating that relationship. Each of these
clause types is described in turn in sections ยง8.1 to ยง8.4. Additionally, there are three
clausal relationships discussed in ยง8.5 which do not impose these restrictions on the
relationship, but have different relationships altogether. These are: comparative
constructions (ยง8.5.1), perceptual complements (ยง8.5.2) and reported speech (ยง8.5.3).
There are six different types of sequential relationships that two clauses can have to
each other. These relationship types are summarized in Table 47, and are listed roughly
in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive in terms of the relationship the two
clauses must have with one another.","[356, 357]"
"ELIC8.5.2 Perception Complements
Perceptual complement statements consist of two clauses in juxtaposition, each
headed by a final, fully inflected verb. The verb of perception (typically ni 'see' or mesu
'hear') is in its own clause while the event or state that was perceived is in a separate
clause. The two clauses can occur in either order with no difference in meaning.",[390]

clitics, one on the numeral (or numeral phrase) and one on the word preceding the

clitics, one on the adjective samba 'big' and one on the numeral, or more accurately the
numeral phrase, since the clitic appears on the word nawe 'only' modifying the numeral.
Example (350) shows a demonstrative followed by a numeral, which is reduplicated (see

Whether this is the normal order if there is both a demonstrative and a numeral is not

"10.1 Kinship System
The kinship system in Mehek is somewhat complicated, as many terms are based
not only on the gender of the referent, but also on the gender of ego. Table 60 lists all
the kin terms in alphabetical order along with summaries of their meanings. Those
terms marked with an asterisk are not kin terms per se, but are commonly used to refer
to deceased relatives.",[430]
"6025139With pronouns, em is used with humans and bu with nonhumans while with adnominal
uses, biki is used with humans or nonhumans and bu with nonhumans. The word biki is
also used with the meaning 'how' and combines with other words to form a number of
other interrogative expressions (ยง7.7.4). The indefinite adnominal use with humans is
covered by the determiner di (ยง5.5).
The interrogative bu is often reduplicated with a plural noun phrase clitic, bu bum.

5.4.8 Reflexive kuna
The reflexive word kuna has two uses. The first use is the one most commonly

object.

In Table 15, only the vowels with allophones have a symbol listed in the 'Allophone'
column. Because the proposed writing system is phonemic, different allophones are not
rendered with different symbols. See ยง3.4 for more on the different environments for
allophones. In the 'Sample Word(s)' column, when multiple words are listed, words with
each allophone are listed in the order they are shown from left to right in their row.
For the vowels, the only convention of note is for the diphthong /ai/. When
sequences of /a/-/y/ occur, there is a neutralization of /a/ and /ai/. Therefore, whenever
/a/ precedes /y/, the pronunciation is [aj]. Examples (14) and (15) show this in the
differing pronunciations of the word na 'become'. In (14), the suffix โmr is added, while
in (15), the suffix โyar is added, altering the pronunciation of the /a/ to /ai/.","[89, 90]"

"7.6 Passive Clauses
The structure of what I analyze as passive clauses seems, initially, to violate the
rules of verbal agreement in the area of person/number/gender agreement (see ยง6.1).
In all other clauses, the verb agrees with the subject noun phrase. In the passive,
however, it appears either that it is the object which triggers agreement marking on the
verb. However, we can account for this if we analyze such clauses as passive clauses. To
describe the structure of passive clauses and how they differ from corresponding active296clauses, it is useful to use the labels 'A' and 'P' for the arguments that are subject and
object respectively in an active clause. A passive clause is constructed from the
corresponding active clause by three changes: (1) placing the P before the A; (2) using
the subject form for the A, which will always be a pronoun (See ยง5.4); and (3) changing
the agreement on the verb so that it agrees with the P. The difference between passive
and active clauses is schematized in Table 45.

V

fu-m-s
3SG.F pig(M) hit-PAST2-3SG.F

"Table 45: Passive Derivation from the Active Clause
There a number of peculiarities of the Mehek passive. One is that the P (the subject
of the passive) cannot be a pronoun. Another is that the A (which is not subject as far as
verb agreement is concerned) not only has to be a pronoun but occurs in subject form,
despite the fact that it does not control subject agreement on the verb. However, the
fact that the pronoun A occurs in what I have been calling subject form might be
because this form is actually the default form, occurring in all contexts where the
pronoun is not an object of the verb or a possessor. For example, as noted in ยง5.10.2,
the subject form is also used for โobjectsโ of relational nouns.",[313]
"3187.8 Negation
Negation is expressed in a number of different ways. The primary negative
morpheme is an invariant word iki.15 Most negative non-imperative clauses contain this
word, though it occasionally co-occurs with a suffix -nak on the verb or a clause-final
negative word mehek. There is a prohibitive word mana that is used in negative
imperative sentences (ยง7.8.3).
7.8.1 iki 'not' and the negative verbal suffix -nak
The default non-imperative negative clause involves just the negative word iki. It
always precedes the final (finite) verb, though not necessarily immediately before the
verb. It typically precedes material other than a subject that is not a pronoun. Example
(321) illustrates iki preceding the adverbial word anganambu 'fast'.

The next set of examples illustrate multiple modifiers preceding a noun. The part of
the formula in (345) that describes the prenominal modifiers as
'(Det/Dem/Poss/Num/PossNP)' is so formulated because I do not have much data on
which prenominal modifiers can co-coccur if they can, what their relative order is. The
only thing that is clear is that the determiner and possessive pronoun can co-occur and
when they do, the determiner precedes the possessive pronoun. Both (354) and (355)

That is, these are the names that speakers will repeat in the tone of the call that the
animal makes. There are likely other names which have onomatopoeic components
which are no longer consciously known to speakers (particularly reduplicative names
that consist of words that are otherwise not found as independent morphemes). The
only non-name words that are known to have an onomatopoeic element are yo 'a sound
made while calling another' and kra 'cry'.
Sound symbolism is also not a productive system, though there a few words where
one of the vowels can vary in relationship to the size of the object being described. In
these cases, the smaller size is associated with a high vowel and the larger size is
77associated with a (relatively) lower vowel. The known examples are given in examples

4.0 Introduction
The purpose of this short chapter is to provide a general overview of some aspects
of the grammatical system of Mehek. In ยง4.1, I summarize the morphology, primarily
the morphology of verbs, while in ยง4.2, I discuss one of the more unusual features of
Mehek, a set of noun phrase clitics that code the number and gender of noun phrases,
plus a similar set of predicate clitics which appear on nonverbal predicates.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"
"96Chapter 5: Nouns and Noun Phrases
5.0 Introduction
The primary defining feature of nouns in Mehek is that they possess inherent
gender (ยงsee 5.1). Although nouns frequently occur with noun phrase clitics (ยง4.2), this
is a feature of noun phrases, not nouns. There is no inflectional morphology on nouns.
Because nouns are not obligatory in noun phrases (see ยง5.14), the occurrence with noun
phrase clitics is not a defining characteristic for nouns. The words that are most like
nouns are adjectives. There are a couple of ways in which nouns are different from
adjectives. One is that nouns are associated with gender, while adjectives are not.
Adjectives can take noun phrase clitics, but only if they happen to be the last word in
the noun phrase. A second difference between nouns and adjectives is that if they cooccur in the noun phrase, the noun will always precede the adjective. This chapter does
not discuss noun phrase clitics; these are discussed in ยง4.2.
This chapter considers properties of nouns and the possible constituents of noun
phrases. Sections ยง5.1 to ยง5.3 discuss three variables associated with nouns and noun
phrases: ยง5.1 discusses gender, ยง5.2 discusses the diminutive, and ยง5.3 discusses
number. Most of the remaining sections discuss the various possible constituents of
noun phrases: ยง5.4 discusses the various types of pronouns; ยง5.5 discusses the
indefinite determiner di; ยง5.6 discusses adjectives and adjective phrases; ยง5.7 discusses
numerals; ยง5.8 discusses nominal possession (both pronominal and nominal
possessors); ยง5.9 discusses relative clauses; ยง5.10 discusses relational nouns and the
97locative/instrumental clitic; ยง5.11 discusses compound nouns; ยง5.12 discusses place
names; ยง5.13 discusses conjoined noun phrases; and ยง5.14 discusses the structure of
noun phrases, how the various types of constituents discussed in the preceding sections
combine with each other.","[112, 113, 114]"
"4.1. Overview of Morphology
Most of the morphology in Mehek occurs on verbs. Possessive and demonstrative
pronouns inflect (see ยง5.4.4 and ยง5.4.6), but nouns do not, although there are noun
phrase clitics that occur in noun phrases that vary for the number and gender of the
noun phrase (see chapter 5). In this section, I give a brief summary of the verbal
morphology. Chapter 6 discusses the verbal morphology in detail.
Verbs bear suffixes for the person, number, and gender of the subject, with an
additional possibility of diminutive inflection; they do not inflect for the object. There
are a variety of suffixes which precede the subject suffixes, coding tense, aspect, and

A third use of the infinitival form of verbs is in one of the negative constructions in
which the verb na 'be' bears the negative suffix -nak and functions as a type of auxiliary
verb while what is semantically the main verb occurs with the infinitival suffix, as in (97).

10.0 Introduction
The following sections group together various lexical domains within the language
that do not fall consistently under any other grammatical heading. This includes kinship
terms (ยง10.1), color terms (ยง10.2), lexical patterns, which includes two words for 'small'
and expressions for 'everybody' (ยง10.3), postural verbs (ยง10.4), and dialect variation
(ยง10.5).","[429, 430]"
"358It is similar in usage to the subordinate affix โk in that it indicates that there is a
connection between the clause containing rokor and the one or ones following. The
difference here, however, is that the subordinate clitic applies only to the verb of the
clause it attaches to and does not imply any syntactic connection to the following
clause(s). It only indicates that another action (often left unstated as it is often made
clear through context, implication, or speaker world knowledge) will follow or is
dependent on the clause it is in (see ยง8.2). The causal marker rokor, on the other hand,
has a syntactic requirement that another clause follow it (although the second clause
may be implicit, as in (54) to (56) above) and that there be some dependency
relationship between the two. The dependency requirement is that the following
clause(s) must occur after and as a result of the first clause. It may also indicate the
purpose of undertaking the succeeding action(s). That is, the rokor clause is a precursor
or prerequisite for the succeeding clause(s). Example (57) illustrates it being used
multiple times in a sequence of connected events that the subject is undertaking.

This alternation between diminutive and masculine or feminine can reflect a shifting
focus on the properties of the referent of the noun phrase as perceived by the speaker,
vis. the size or affection towards the object.
There are a few places in Mehek grammar where there is either no possibility of a
diminutive value or the diminutive form is rarely used, although coding of
person/number/gender is possible. One situation where there is no possibility of a
diminutive value is in the possessive pronouns (ยง5.4.4), where one must code the
possessor as masculine or feminine. A similar situation arises with the object form of
personal pronouns (ยง5.4.2). There is again no diminutive form, though curiously the
form of the feminine object pronoun is te, the form we would expect if there were a
diminutive object pronoun, rather than what would be the expected form se (which
does not exist). With the subject form of personal pronouns, there is a diminutive form
tu, but it is rarely used.
Within a text, it is possible for a given referent to be treated as masculine or
feminine part of the time but as diminutive part of the time. For example, the text in
Appendix 1 (Text A.1), there are two women, both wives of the male character in the105text. The first wife is treated as feminine in sentence (4) and continues as such until
sentence (28), where she is treated as diminutive, though this occurs in a direct
quotation by the husband. And in sentence (30), she is treated as feminine, though this
too occurs in a direct quotation, but by the second wife. In sentence (33), she is treated
as diminutive but although this is not a direct quotation, the sentence is saying that the
husband feels bad for her, so the choice of diminutive may reflect the husbandโs
feelings. In sentences (36) and (37) and subsequent sentences, she is again treated as
feminine. The second wife is initially treated as diminutive in sentence (5). However, in
subsequent sentences she is treated as feminine.
It is possible to have alternations between diminutive and feminine or masculine
gender or plural number for the same referent within the same sentence. In (15), the
subject aye barmbar has a coreferential feminine pronoun su following it, but the two
predicates of this clause, kandat 'thin' and kaiembot 'small' both bear diminutive
predicate clitics (and the verbs of the next two clauses, both suknat 'sleep', also bear
diminutive inflection). However, this could be attributed to the fact that the diminutive
subject pronoun tu is rarely used.

106A similar example is given in (16), where the mosquito is treated as diminutive in
the first clause, both by the noun phrase clitic on fit 'mosquito' and the predicate clitic
on ata 'very', while in the next clause the possessive form is sokom, which now treats
the mosquito as feminine. However, this can be explained by the lack of a possessive
pronoun indicating a diminutive possessor.

Another example of this is given in (17). The noun phrase naku walo 'walo sago' is the
possessor of kulka 'leaf' and the possessive pronoun sokot bears feminine inflection for
the possessor, while in the clause at the end, it is treated as diminutive, as illustrated by
the diminutive predicate clitic on kufet 'good'.

conjoined noun phrase, conjoining liki sokor 'its skin' with kulka sokom 'its feathers'. We
might expect the resulting noun phrase to be plural, but instead we get diminutive
predicate clitics on the three predicate adjectives.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"
"208Chapter 6: Verbs
6.0 Introduction
This section describes the verbs of Mehek. Verbs are the heads of their clauses and
can occur with a variety of marking, in groups, or singly. The various verb forms can be
divided into two general types, what I will call finite verbs and nonfinite verbs. The
defining feature of finite verbs is that they bear inflection for the person, number, and
gender of the subject. A finite verb has tense or mood, aspect, and person/number/
gender marking (though in this group, aspectual marking is infrequent and cannot cooccur with a mood suffix, though it can co-occur with tense). Nonfinite verbs come in a
variety of forms. Broadly speaking, these nonfinite forms include (1) bare verb stems,
without any inflection (though possibly with the realis clitic); (2) verb stems plus tense
or mood affixes that occur in finite verb forms, but without subject inflection; and (3)
verbs bearing suffixes that do not co-occur with other suffixes. Sub-sections ยง6.1 - ยง6.6
exemplify each of the different suffixes that can occupy the verbal slots.
The general schema of the verb morphology for finite verb forms is given in (1). 9
(1) Verb = stem + (aspect) + tense/mood + subject agreement
While (1) shows both tense/mood and subject agreement as obligatory, they are in fact
not. Since I define finite forms as those bearing subject suffixes, such suffixes are by9The formula in (1) does not capture the fact that one does not get aspect suffixes with mood suffixes,
only with tense suffixes.","[224, 225]"
"302In other words, it only appears on predicates. It seems that the predicate is always or
almost always last in questions; i.e. no other constituents of the sentence will follow the
predicate.
When the subject is second person singular, there is generally no overt marking of
the sentence as a question; I represent this in the examples by '=รธ', glossed '2SG.INT'.
This is illustrated in (245) to (250). Note that when this happens, the form of the verb is
still distinct from that in a corresponding declarative sentence in that there will be a
tense suffix but no subject suffix on the verb;. This contrasts with clauses with a subject
that it not second person singular, where we get both subject suffix and the clitic =ka.
For this reason, one might posit a zero interrogative clitic in these sentences with
second person singular subjects.

imperative pronouns. The forms are shown in Table 25.

amafunkumofomTable 25: Imperative Pronouns
The only unique imperative forms are those for first person. The third person forms
are identical to the third person demonstrative pronouns (see ยง5.4.6) while the forms
for second person are identical with the second person subject pronouns. Verbal
marking for imperative mood is accomplished by use of a bare verb stem, and the use of
an imperative pronoun together with the verb stem is otherwise the only way to
indicate a command. For second person commands, the dual and plural pronouns are116obligatory with the bare verb, while the second person singular pronoun is optional.

"5021As noted above, some of the relational nouns and some uses of other relational
nouns might be analyzed as postpositions. For one thing, they often signal a semantic
relationship between a noun phrase and a verb (or noun), like adpositions in other
languages, rather than denoting something the way noun phrases normally do. This is
especially true for some relational nouns, like kana 'with' and yungu 'like'.
Although relational nouns do not occur with noun phrase clitics when they are
functioning as adjuncts of the verb, they do occur with noun phrase clitics when they
function as part of a noun phrase. In (288), for example, the masculine noun phrase
clitic =r occurs on kana, but in this case lam kana 'with spines' is modifying the noun
kufu 'vine' and the noun phrase clitic occurs on kana only because kana is the last word
in the entire noun phrase kufu lam kana. That is, it is not marking the relational noun
phrase lam kana but rather the entire noun phrase kufu lam kana 'a vine with spines'.
(288) kufu lam kana=r
vine spine with=M

5.4.9 Use of Pronouns
The personal pronouns are used quite frequently in discourse. In a typical discourse,
a full noun phrase will be used only once when a primary character is introduced.
Occasionally, a full noun phrase will be used a second time if the story is quite long or
new characters come into play which might confuse the situation. Because of this,
pronouns do the lionโs share of reference in most traditional narratives. Even if there
are five characters interacting and they are all male, typically only pronouns will be used
to refer to them. Despite this potential for confusion (at least from the perspective of an
outsider), full noun phrases are often not used. The same holds true for spontaneous
speech as well. Names or kin terms are not frequently used unless the context does not
indicate who the referent might be. Often it will be known where an interlocutor has
just been, so stating the name of the person being discussed is not necessary to either
party. This makes the use of pronouns very important and common.","[157, 158, 159]"

7.8.4 Other Words with Negative Meaning
There are a few words that incorporate a negative meaning or are used in a
negative context. This includes the verbs nime 'not be able' and mana 'not want'. The327former is illustrated in examples (367) and (368), while the latter is illustrated in (369) to
(371).

The word timba is a negative word that expresses the meaning 'not have'. It occurs
in a construction with the possessor as subject and thing possessed a noun phrase
before the verb, possibly an object, as in (372) and (373). It behaves like an adjective in
that it occurs with person/number/gender clitics in predicate position, but apparently
does not occur with verb morphology.
