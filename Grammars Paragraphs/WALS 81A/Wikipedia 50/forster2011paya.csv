"2.4 Grammar
2.4.1 Word order (Ex. 29–30)
Most languages allow for some variation in the normal word order for specific reasons. In Kuna, the normal
word order is different from Spanish or English. Normal word order in the transitive sentence is subject, object,
predicate.
Example
Subject
Object
An
ogob
I
coconut
‗I want to eat coconut.‘Predicate
kumpi.
eat-want-toExercise 29. Word order -- object substitution drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the class repeats it. The teacher says Sentence 2 and the class repeats it, etc.
This exercise should be repeated several times.",[32]
"‗I do not know.‘7. Word order
The normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.
Example
Omedin we mol pakcha.
‗The woman bought that blouse.‘
―The woman‖ in the above example is not only the subject of the sentence, but also the topic of the conversation
as indicated by the topic-establishing suffix -din.
In another situation, it might be the blouse which is under discussion, and the speaker merely comments on the
fact that the woman bought it. In that case, the topic of conversation is the blouse and a Kuna speaker would
change the word order of the sentence by putting the topic (the blouse) first; i.e., topic (object) + subject +
predicate.
The topic is always first in a Kuna sentence (following any setting or conjunction), and usually occurs with a
topic-establishing suffix -din/-tin.
Example
‗That blouse was bought by the woman. (Lit.: As for
the blouse, the woman bought (it).)‘
In summary, it may be said that when the subject of the sentence is not the topic of conversation, the normal
word order is rearranged and the topic is positioned at the beginning of the main part of the sentence.
We moldin, ome pakcha.",[309]
"‗I would like you to be so kind as to help me.‘2) Additional information stated in the request
As stated above, a subject must be used when the word wis ‗a little‘ is used in the request command. The
subject precedes wis and the rest of the very polite command follows normal word order. Wis can be
repeated before the verb to make the request very polite: vocative + subject + wis + indirect object + direct
object + verb ( + -gwel/-kwel) ( + -o).
Example
Pedro, pe wis anka ina (wis) ukkwelo.",[213]
"‗Please give it to me.‘
‗Please come to me.‘2) Additional information in a polite command
Additional information, such as a phrase to clarify the purpose of an action or goal of a motion, is
mandatory90 in a polite command. Or, a polite command may include a direct object, indirect object, or
some other phrase. The subject is rarely stated. Word order of a polite command follows normal pattern;
that is to say, the additional information always precedes the verb.",[207]
"‗Tomorrow, I‘m going to plant rice. The day after
tomorrow (on the other hand), I‘m going to spear
fish.‘b) Time expressions used after the subject
If a time expression is used as an adverb to limit the scope of the action by stating when it took place (or
will take place), the time expression occurs after the subject of the sentence. This parallels the time
expression occurring after the verb in English, ―I will go at 3 o‘clock.‖
Example
Antin pan ne.
‗I am going tomorrow.‘
If there is more than one adverbial expression occurring after the subject, the time expression occurs
immediately following the subject. This word order is different from English word order.
ExampleAntin pan negzhe ne.",[160]
"‗Kunas eat fish.‘
‗I practice medicine.‘
‗I (always) buy blouses.‘
‗I (always) pull teeth.‘
‗My wife (always) sews blouses.‘Exercise 16. Habitual aspect drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student changes it to the habitual aspect form of the verb and adds the word
pane-pane ‗everyday‘.52
ExampleTeacher: Machi ua kucha.
Student: Machi pane-pane ua kun.
1. Machi ua kucha.
‗The boy ate the fish.‘
2. Tad ua chwas.
‗The elder caught fish.‘
3. Pun mol enukcha.
‗The girl washed the clothes.‘
4. Mu mol makne.
‗The old lady is going to sew a blouse.‘
5. Ome mas tus.
‗The woman cooked food.‘10.4.10 Adverbs (Ex. 17–18)
Adverbs in Kuna, as in English, modify the verb; but their position in the sentence is different from English
word order. In Kuna, they occur after the subject and before the indirect or direct object: subject + adverb +
indirect object + direct object + verb.
Subtle nuances of meaning are achieved by changing this basic word order and are discussed in later lessons.
Example
Pab pirkin machi pilal.",[139]
"‗Tomorrow I want to plant corn.‘
‗Day after tomorrow I want to weed corn.‘
‗Later I want to buy corn.‘
‗At noon I want to fetch corn.‘
‗Tomorrow I want to harvest corn.‘3.4.3 Intransitive sentence word order
In Kuna, the normal word order for an intransitive sentence is subject, then predicate. This is similar to the word
order in intransitive sentences in English.
Example
Subject
Predicate
An
abarmane.
I
run-going-to
‗I am going to run.‘
3.4.4 Long and short forms of words
Many (but not all) Kuna words have a short form and a long form. The short form of a word is made by
dropping the final vowel.",[43]
"‗Make the boy drink the medicine.‘19.4.7.3 Verb ima „to make‟ in causative command
If a verb is not intrinsically causative and has no causative form, the imperative form of the verb ima ‗to make‘
is used. The purpose suffix -gal/-kal is added to the verb which is to be carried out. The action verb plus
-gal/-kal is followed by the actor and subsequently by imako ‗make‘.
Example
(Pe) neg chobgal machi imako.
‗(You) make the boy build the house.‘
Note the difference in word order. In this example, machi, the one caused to do the action, precedes ―to make‖
while the object of building occurs in the normal order for a direct object. On the other hand, in the example for
Exercise 12, machi occurs in the normal order for an indirect object but without the suffix -ga/-ka.
19.4.7.4 Prevention of causative action
To prevent an action from being caused, the word melle ‗do not‘ is used to begin the causative command
sentence.
Examples
1. Melle machi palmidago.
2. Melle machi ina ogobo.
3. Melle neg chobgal machi imako.",[276]
"9.4 Grammar
Adjectives
Adjectives in Kuna, as in Spanish and English, are modifiers of a person or object and are used in conjunction
with the noun in order to describe it more fully. Most Kuna adjectives are part of a noun phrase and convey a
concept similar to the English/Spanish adjectival concept. Since some aspects of negation of adjectives and of
Kuna color are unique, they are described apart from the general discussion on adjectives. The formation of
attributive and existence sentences is also unique.
9.4.1 Word order of a noun phrase (Ex. 4–5)
A noun phrase may consist of a noun, adjective and suffix, or of a noun modifying another noun.
9.4.1.1 Position of adjective in noun phrase
In Kuna, unlike English, the adjective is placed after the noun.
ExampleKarpa tummad chi.",[117]
"302APPENDIX K: ORDERING OF STORY INTRODUCTIONS
In Kuna, the introduction to a story or the relating of an event is presented in a set order: topical information,
identificational information, descriptive information, evaluatory information and summary information. The
story introduction must be presented in the pre-determined order in order, to ensure that the listener will
understand the nature of the story.","[315, 316]"
"Exercise 4. Answer intonation drill
The teacher says Dialogue 3.1 and the student reads the dialogue, humming the intonation quietly as the teacher
reads aloud. Pay special attention to the intonation and pitch of the answers.
3.2.3.2 Intonation pattern of questions
A question has a different intonation pattern from a statement. The actual order of words in a question which requires
a yes/no answer is the same order as for a statement. Because the word order does not vary, it is important that you
learn the intonation patterns for questions versus statements in order to distinguish a question from an answer.
In Kuna, the pitch at which the question is said is higher than the pitch of a statement. The last word of a
question is even higher pitch than the rest of the question and then the pitch of that word falls off quickly.",[38]
"‗I bought yeast, for Mother to make bread for me.‘14.4.6.2 Purpose clause - event precipitated by action of independent sentence
Another type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be precipitated by the action in the
independent sentence. This clause begins with meke ‗in order that‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal is added
to the verb.
The purpose clause marked by meke ‗in order to‘ focusses more attention on the purpose than on the main
action. It expresses the desired outcome or result (as yet unfulfilled) of the main action. It is part of the mainline
information and advances the story/explanation/argument another step in the logical progression.
The meke form of a purpose clause almost always occurs in the postpredicate position. Even though the subject
may be the same in both clauses, it must be stated in both clauses.",[193]
"3.4 Grammar
3.4.1 Yes/No questions
As stated in 3.2.3.2, the order of words in a question requiring an eye ‗yes‘ or chuli ‗no‘ answer is the same as
the order of the words in a statement. In conversation, a question is distinguished from a statement by
intonation. In writing, a question is distinguished from a statement by punctuation (question marks).
Example¿Pe mas tune?",[41]
"‗(Hey) Boy, come!‘2) Additional information included in a strong command
In contrast to the polite command, a strong command is usually comprised of only a verb. It keeps
additional elements to a minimum. Additional information may be used to intensify the command or to
clarify a certain aspect of the command.
a) Intensification of strong command
When a speaker wishes to make a certain aspect of command more forceful, that aspect is added to the
command in the normal word order. That is to say, it precedes the verb. When the subject of the command
is made more forceful, the vocative92 form is used. It may be either the long or short form.
Examples
1. ¡Machi, tage!
2. Negzhe ne.
3. Machi, negzhe ne.",[210]
29See Appendix E for an explanation of the word order in these two examples.,[82]
"105It could be argued that locative and goal words and phrases are basic elements of sentences with motion or positional
verbs and that the indirect object is a basic element with a ditransitive verb. However, we have chosen to treat as peripheral
any nominal element in which a suffix indicates its function. By this criterion, only subject and object, and possibly
vocative, are basic nominal elements.",[245]
"‗The father loves the boy very much.‘Exercise 17. Adverbial word order frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc.",[139]
"Teacher: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
Student: Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
Sagla mani ukcha, ob pakegal.
‗The chief gave (me) money in order to buy corn.‘
An ne, immal pakegal.
‗I am going, in order to buy something.‘
Machimal ya kinai, ti ariogal.
‗The boys are digging a ditch, in order for the water to
flow (away).‘
An akan amine, tad ul chobgal.
‗I am going to look for an axe in order for grandfather
to make a canoe.‘
An kal palmis, nudagal.
‗I sent the radio, in order to repair it.‘Exercise 14. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal drill
The teacher reads the pair of sentences. The student makes the second sentence into a purpose clause by using
-gal/-kal.
ExampleTeacher: Machi kinki pakcha.
Teacher: Machi immal amine
Student: Machi kinki pakcha, immal aminegal.
1a. Machi kinki pakcha.
‗The young man bought a gun.‘
b. Machi immal amine.
‗The young man is going to go hunting.‘
2a. Ome mol makcha.
‗The woman sewed a blouse.‘
b. Ome mol ukne.
‗The woman is going to sell the blouse.‘
3a. Tad koe mecha.
‗The elder killed a deer.‘
b. Tad koe kunne.
‗The elder is going to eat the deer.‘
4a. Tule tagar chwas.
‗The people gathered thatch.‘
b. Tule neg makne.
‗The people are going to thatch a house.‘
5a. Machi nagwal chikcha.
‗The young man cut rushes.‘
b. Machi karpa chomne.
‗The young man is going to make a basket.‘182Social InteractionExercise 15. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal with meke or melle
The teacher says the sentence and then says either meke or melle. The student uses the frame to make a
sentence incorporating the sentence said by the teacher as a purpose clause.
ExampleTeacher: An ne.
Teacher: melle
Student: Pe anka chogo, melle an negal.
Frame Pe anka chogo: meke/melle ____-gal. ‗Please tell me so that I will/won‘t ____.‘
1. An ne.
‗I am going.‘
2. Machi e urpa pentas.
‗The boy helped his younger brother.‘
3. An pega mol ukcha.
‗I sold the blouse for you.‘
4. An mas kunne.
‗I am going to eat.‘
5. An machi odurtas.
‗I punished the boy.‘14.4.6.4 Noun of purpose (implement)
An implement or tool used in performing a certain task or action may be referred to by adding the suffix
-gal/-kal to the verb stem that describes the action itself.
Examples
1a. turwi
‗to sweep‘
b. turwigal
‗broom‘
2a. igmu
‗to burrow‘
b. igmugal
‗(type of) hoe (for burrowing in the earth) (Spanish: coa)‘
This device for naming implements cannot be used for all implements. Some forms are unacceptable, and some
are never used. It is very useful, however, in describing a tool foreign to the culture.
14.4.7 Accompaniment suffix -bak/-pak (Ex. 16–19)
In English, the preposition ―with‖ is used to refer to accompaniment. For example, ―I ate fish with
(accompanied by) my wife.‖ or ―I ate fish with (accompanied by) rice.‖ In Kuna, the concept of
accompaniment is rendered by the suffix -bak/-pak attached to the noun. The -bak/-pak form of a word occurs
in the same place in a sentence as an adverb.
Examples
1. An arozbak ua kucha.
‗I ate fish with rice.‘
2. An omebak ua kucha.
‗I ate fish with my wife.‘
If an adverb also occurs, one could say: subject + adverb + accompaniment + object + verb.
Example
An kueye-kueye arosbak ua kucha.
‗I quickly ate the fish with (my) rice.‘
However, because of information overload (see Section 17), the preferred construction is: subject + adverb +
object + verb + accompaniment.
Example
An kueye-kueye ua kucha, arosbak.
‗I quickly ate the fish with my rice.‘
-bak/-pak may also be used to associate the subject or object of the sentence with another person.
Examples
1. An saglabak ai nued.
2. Pablo saglabak aichulid.
3. Pedro saglabak istargad.","[194, 195]"
"APPENDIX F: FURTHER NOTES ON -BAL/-PAL
When the suffix - bal/-pal is used in conjunction with the desiderative suffix -bi/-pi, the order of the suffixes
varies according to the significance of the utterance. That is to say, the order of suffixes varies according to the
focus of the desire.","[309, 310]"
"1) Uni-directional verbs
Most Kuna motion verbs are uni-directional, i.e., they involve only one direction of movement. As
previously noted, in order to understand the use of specific motion verbs, it is necessary to consider both
the reference point of the motion and the scope.",[233]
"‗I bought some things: cloth, needles, and thread.‘8) Hesitation
When a person hesitates, in order to recall a forgotten word or name, the long form of the word is used
(see 17.4.1.3 and 17.4.2.4).
Example
Antin iwen takcha, iwenna ... Pedro.",[304]
"84Buying and Selling7.4.3.1 Melu „How much?‟
Melu ‗How much?‘ is a question word which is used in order to question the quantity of an item which is being
requested or spoken of. It is a general term and can be used with all classes of items.
Examples
1. ¿Melu pei?
2. ¿Nuzhade, melu napi?","[96, 97]"
"12.3 CULTURE
The Kuna culture has a highly developed democratic system. Any adult man or woman has the right to speak at
length on any subject in a town meeting. The protocol of town meetings is quite rigid and it is helpful for the
outsider to be aware of certain rules which Kunas observe in their meetings.
The order in which people speak is strictly adhered to. The order is: village leaders in order of status, older men
(tadgana), younger men (machimala), male outsiders, older women, younger women, female outsiders.
Before the meeting, you are expected to advise the chief, who calls the meeting, of any subject you wish to have
discussed. At that time, you must also discuss any questions the chief might have concerning the subject you
wish discussed.
Normally, the chief will call on you, the outsider, to speak when your item on the agenda is reached. Once you
have presented your case, it is not polite to interrupt another speaker who is speaking to your subject. If you feel
you need to answer a certain objection or correct a misunderstanding, you may ask the chief for permission to
speak again before further discussion takes place.
At the close of the discussion, the chief will announce to you the official acceptance or rejection of your
proposal/request. It is not proper for you, as an outsider, to speak on any subject which does not directly involve
you or the people you represent. Visiting Kunas from outside the community have the same rule imposed upon
them.
If you wish to be excused from a meeting which you are expected to attend, you must inform the chief or the
chowal ibed deputy. He is the person who officially notified you of the time and place of the meeting.",[155]

7.4.1 Numbers (Ex. 6–19)
In 5.4.1., basic number stems, the word order of the number phrase, and numeral prefixes from Group I (Shape
of object prefixes) and Group II (Complex number-building prefixes) are discussed. Prefixes from Group III
(Measurement-related prefixes) and Group IV (Time-related prefixes) are also in constant use in the Kuna
counting system.
Measurement-related prefixes and time-related prefixes are vital to your control of the numerical system in
Kuna.
7.4.1.1 Group III. Measurement-related prefixes
Measurement-related prefixes are used to describe collective nouns or quantitative measurements such as
pounds, bushels, herds. The measurement-related prefixes attach to any basic number stem as the shape of
object prefixes. There are several measurement-related prefixes.","[81, 82]"
"→→ visualize → words, but not:
An immal amine → I thing going to look for

And, thus, we have: words→‗I‘m going hunting.‘Appenxix N309B. Steps in Learning136
In order to really learn something in Kuna, you have to go through five steps in the learning process.
1. Awareness
First, you need to be made aware of the existence of a particular sound, word, grammatical construction or
intonation pattern and its meaning. Yon have to learn to ―hear‖ (recognize) it in a particular context. For
example, you find out (become aware) that toa means ―who‖ and start to ―hear‖ (recognize) it when it is used in
an amplificatory question (see Section 4.4.3.1).
Example¿Toa nade?","[321, 322]"
"‗Older brother, I am going.‘10.4.7 Indirect object (Ex. 14)
The indirect object in Kuna functions in approximately the same way that it does in English. For example, ―I
gave the ball to the boy‖ specifies the person to whom the ball was given as the boy (indirect object).
In Kuna, the indirect object usually occurs after the subject and before the direct object and verb in transitive
sentences, or before a verb of ―saying.‖ It is marked by the addition of the suffix -ga/-ka to the noun, proper
name or pronoun.
Examples
1. An pega mol ukcha.
‗I gave the blouse to you.‘
2. An machiga chogzha.
‗I said (it) to the boy.‘
If, however, the indirect object is in focus, it occurs after the verb.
Examples
1. An mol ukcha, pega.
2. An chogzha, machiga.",[138]
"Appenxix N3194. if wrong, form a new hypothesis and check again

6. learn the rule
7. use and practice the construction
5. Gathering and processing information
There are several books which adequately deal with this subject and it is beyond my purpose here to deal
extensively with this subject. However, there are two cardinal rules worth repeating:
a. Write it down
When you gather information (language data), write it down. Otherwise, you (in common with humankind) will
forget it.
b. Filing
The information written down must be filed in such a way as you can readily ―find‖ it.
c. Rate
Don’t gather information faster than you can digest (process) it, or it will drown you. For example, don‘t sit
down and gather 100 new words. Just take 5–10 new words, write them down, check their meaning, learn them
and use them. Then, and only then, gather another 5–10 new words or one grammatical device and assimilate
that.","[331, 332]"

A. Learning Outside the Classroom
The lessons in this grammar were designed mainly for classroom use. For the student who is learning the
language living among the people, or for those who wish extra or further study of the language, the questions
arise:
1. ―How do I learn outside of the classroom?‖
2. ―How do I go beyond the information in these lessons?‖ (The learner will inevitably find that he wants to
know much more on some topics.)
This appendix is an attempt to answer these questions.
1. Goal of language learning
The ultimate goal of language learning is to be completely bilingual; to be able to say anything you want to
express with all the nuances of meaning and shades of emotion with as much facility as you can in your first
language (mother tongue). Although few people really achieve this goal, it is something for which we should all
aim. However, for our encouragement along the way, there are various stages (levels) of achievement. The
following is one scheme:
Stage 1: When you are able to greet people and say goodbye.
Stage 2: When you are also able to exchange pleasantries.
Stage 3: When you are able to parrot fixed phrases, dealing with essential needs such as food, shelter, a guide,
directions, basic buying and selling.
Stage 4: When you are able to communicate effectively in the specialized areas where you have most contact
such as medical, trade, teaching or work projects.
Stage 5: When you are able to communicate, generally, in all common aspects of everyday life with a limited
number of verb aspects (tenses).
Stage 6: When you are able to control reasonably well most normal grammatical relationships such as
cause-effect, time, location, condition, purpose, ability, possibility and motion verbs.
Stage 7: When you are fluent in any non-abstract area up through Stage 6 and reasonably control focus and
emphasis.
Stage 8: When you are able to talk about the abstract, present an argument, use figures of speech, etc.
Stage 9: When you are able to discuss emotions, values ,and able to discuss life from the Kuna philosophical
viewpoint.
Goal: Absolute bilingualism.
2. Problem of adult language learning
A child will learn three or four languages without difficulty. Any new sound, word or grammatical construction
gets added to his repertoire. It will take him a while to separate out the systems of each language entirely. This
he will do provided he is exposed to environments where only one system is present. (Otherwise, he fails and
this leads to the formation of a Creole.)
By adulthood, however, the limited repertoire of sounds, words and grammatical systems of the mother tongue
has become so habitual (automatic) that they have formed almost a closed system. It takes will power,
determination and effort to learn new distinctions, new patterns, and new words. Adults do not enjoy repeating,
repeating and repeating things. But this is what it takes for the new sounds, words, and grammatical patterns to
become automatic. This is the only way to become fluent.
Now, there are ways of making the repetition more palatable, e.g., It is much better to ―become fluent‖ in a
prepared conversation by visiting a dozen homes and saying it in each home, than saying it to yourself twelve
times at your desk. (Besides, hopefully, the people you visit will correct you.)
307308Language Learning3. Speaking a language
In order to speak a language, you have to ―think‖ that language. You need to ―see‖ in that language and you
need to ―visualize‖ in that language. You should never translate into that language from the mother tongue or
bridge language. To illustrate this, when you see:
Figure 9.you think ulu, not ―canoe‖.
When you visualize:
Figure 10.you think An immal amine, not ―I‘m going to hunt.‖
You should never translate ―I‖ as ani, ―am going to‖ as -ne, or ―hunt‖ as ami, because often you will end up
with a mismatch, such as An (omitted) amine in which immal ‗thing, animal‘ has been omitted. It is also very
difficult to translate quickly enough.
4. Translation
Where you have to translate/interpret for someone else, then you proceed:
Figure 11.","[317, 318, 319, 320, 321]"
"14.4 Grammar181Examples
1. Antin pe pabga mani palmine, meke adin
‗I am going to send money to your father, in order
Panamaje taggal.
that he will come to Panama.‘
2. Antin immis mani amine, meke an pan
‗I am going to get money today, so that I can buy
nabir immal pakegal.
(some) things tomorrow.‘
In order to understand the change of focus given by the use of the word meke, contrast Example 1 above with
the following sentence, in which the purpose of sending money is explained, rather than focussing on the goal
of having your father come to Panama.
Example
‗I am going to send money to your father, to/for him
to come to Panama.‘Antin pe pabga mani palmine, adin
Panamaje taggal.","[193, 194]"
"189‗I told the boy.‘
‗I‘ll call you.‘
‗The boy is going to ask the chief.‘
‗The woman called the girl.‘
‗Mother talked with auntie.‘14.4.9.2 Subject matter of speaking verbs
When the subject matter of a speaking verb 85 involves a person or the things a person said, the specific or
general instrument suffixes are used.
The specific instrument suffix -gin/-kin is attached to the pronoun or name of the person being talked about and
around whom the conversation revolves.
Examples
1. Anmal pegin chunmas.
‗We talked about you.‘
2. Sagla nangin chunmas.
‗The chief talked about Mother.‘
3. María Silviagin chunmas.
‗Mary talked about Silvia.‘
The general instrument suffix -bal/-pal is used to refer to what a person talked about rather than talking about
the person. The suffix is attached to the name or pronominal reference to the person.
Example
Anmal pebal chunmas.
‗We talked about what you said.‘
Word order dictates that the subject matter of the conversation comes after the person spoken to and before the
verb.
Examples
1. An saglabak pegin chunmas.
‗I talked to the chief about you.‘
2. An tummadga pebal chogzha.
‗I told the leader what you had said.‘
Some further examples may help to clarify the use of a person as an indirect object, as the topic of conversation
or as the one who said something.
Examples
The speaker reports the person to the chief, probably for allegedly bad behavior:
1a. An saglaga pe chogzha.
‗I told the chief on you.‘
The speaker tells the chief details about a person or the details about an incident involving a person:
b. An saglaga pegin chogzha.
The speaker tells the chief what the person said:
c. An saglaga pebal chogzha.
2a. An saglaje pe ekichis.",[202]
"‗To here, is all I say.‘
‗I have nothing further to say.‘
‗That‘s it/thus it was, you hear/understand.‘
‗Oh! Mmmm. (floor is open for anyone to speak).‘11.4.6 Waiving the floor
Often a speaker is speaking to a group of people, but one of the people is the real object of his comments or the
listeners have a known order of rank which dictates who may take the floor first. If on the speaker‘s
yielding-the-floor, the main person spoken to or the status person wishes to leave the floor ―free,‖ he may do so
by using the the waiving-the-floor expression.",[148]

The purpose of this grammar is to help any interested person learn to speak and understand Paya Kuna ,
which is spoken by the people of Paya, Pucuru, and Capetí in the Darién province of the Republic of Panama
and in the Kuna settlements of Arquía and Kudi on the Colombian side of the border. This volume deals with
some of the most basic characteristics of Kuna pronunciation and grammar, and it provides appendices on
various topics and a fairly extensive Paya Kuna vocabulary. Many important characteristics are not discussed
in this volume, but hopefully, after mastering these first twenty lessons the student will be equipped to
continue self-directed language learning. The grammar was designed primarily for use in a classroom where
the teacher is a native speaker of Kuna, but it also lends itself to learning Kuna in the informal situation of a
Paya Kuna village. Each section is not meant to be covered in a single class period, but normally consists of a
dialogue, pronunciation notes, notes on cultural etiquette, grammar aspects and exercises, and vocabulary
items for memorization. Emphasis is put on learning by mimicking in chorus and alone until the speech
patterns become automatic, thus, using a conversational approach to learning a language. An attempt is made
throughout to not only explain and drill the forms discussed, but also to enable language students to know in
which situational contexts their use is appropriate. An effort was also made to show the inseparability of the
Kuna language from its socio-cultural context.ixTHE PAYA KUNA ALPHABET
To simplify reference, Paya Kuna will be referred to as ―Kuna.‖ For pedagogical purposes some modifications
of the official Kuna alphabet have been employed in the spelling of Kuna words in the body of the text. In the
vocabulary in Volume 3, if the official spelling differs from the practical one adopted for this grammar, it is
given in square brackets.

1.1 Dialogue
When you first encounter a Kuna speaker, it is important to establish rapport. The first step is the use of
greetings and leave-takings appropriate to the occasion. One of the common formats for greeting and
leave-taking is given in this Dialogue.
Upon arrival:
1.
2.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"‗The fish is small.‘
‗The fish is not small.‘
‗That fish is not small.‘Exercise 22. Chul ‗no‘ denial stimulus-response drill
The teacher selects a sentence and says it. The student replies denying the statement.
ExamplesTeacher: Uade, totó.
Student: Uadin, toto chul.
1. Uade, totó.
‗That fish is small.‘
2. Molde, muis.
‗That cloth is cheap.‘
3. Manide, unni.
‗That money is enough.‘
4. Akande, nued.
‗That axe is good.‘
5. Ulde, tummad.
‗That canoe is big.‘15.4.2.2 Basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhul(i)/-jul(i)
The basic negative suffix -chul(i)/-zhuli/-jul(i) may be added to certain words in order to negate the word itself
or it may be used to negate an entire sentence.
95This construction is the negation of the adjective and does not carry the antithetic connotation of the suffixed word (see
9.4.2.3).",[218]
"‗The big canoe arrived.‘
‗The young deer escaped.‘
‗The tall outsider left.‘
‗Many parrots ate the corn.‘
‗A big tree grows on the (river) bank.‘Exercise 16. Postpredicate position (subject expansion) drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student repeats it, expanding the subject by using one of the suggested
expansions below.
ExampleTeacher: Ul noni.
Student: Ul noni; ul tummad.
Expansion
1. tummad
‗big‘
2. arrad
‗blue‘
3. nued
‗good‘
Statement
1. Ul noni.
‗The canoe arrived.‘
2. Tud neg tikalbal nis.
‗The flower grew beside the house.‘
3. Kukualed aktes.
‗The plane landed.‘
4. Motor nakwis.
‗The outboard canoe went/came upriver.‘
5. Chikwi purkwis.
‗The bird died.‘
Similarly, the direct object may be stated in an unexpanded form in the simple sentence and in an
expanded form in the postpredicate position in order to highlight or clarify it. The adjective which
modifies the direct object and occurs in the postpredicate position may occur in its long or short form. If
two forms exist for that particular adjective, the long form is more descriptive.",[250]
"14.4.6.3 Purpose clause - event prevented by independent sentence action
This third type of purpose clause expresses the event which, it is hoped, will be averted/prevented by the action
in the independent sentence. This clause begins with the adverb melle ‗don‘t‘ and the purposive suffix -gal/-kal
is added to the verb. This parallels the English construction ―in order not to....‖
Example
Pe anka chogo, melle an igegal.",[194]

Listen to tapes of travel stories and track them, in order to thoroughly master the intonation patterns.",[226]
"‗Whose (is it)?‘
‗To what (does it belong?‘13.4.2.5 Extended use of -gad/-kad
-gad/-kad is used in the sense of ‗made of some type of material‘.

Student: Angadi.
Answers
1. an
‗I‘
2. mu
‗older respected lady‘64The variation in word order in which the possessive -gad/-kad form precedes the noun indicates that the focus is on the
possessive word. For example, Ankad ul cheles. ‗(It was) my canoe that was washed away.‘ but Ul ankad cheles. ‗My
canoe was washed away.‘162Communicating Community Togetherness3. pab

"1) Primary color names
The primary colors, in the order in which they are listed below, comprise the base and mid-points of the
Kuna color spectrum. They are all pure colors and, therefore, highly valued, but red is the most appealing
of all:
1. kinnid
2. kollogwad38
3. arrad‗red‘
‗yellow‘
‗blue‘2) Coined terms for color
Secondary colors between the base and mid-points on the spectrum, that is, those such as orange, green,
and violet, do not have specific names, and are often referred to by coined terms that may vary from one
speaker to another. The coined tem is derived from the name of a familiar object of similar color plus a
color suffix -gid.
Examples
1. kwili apchalgid
2. chapkalegid37‗the color of parakeet feathers (lime green)‘
‗the color of a leaf (green)‘A more-detailed discussion of Kuna color perspective is found in ―Spectral colors and intensity in Paya Kuna color
terminology‖, Wilma Forster, forthcoming.
38
Although kollogwad ‗yellow‘ is a coined term derived from kollo ‗ripe‘ plus -gwad, it usually occurs in this form, but
sometimes in a given context a yellow object may be referred to simply as kollo ‗yellow‘. All Kunas use this term for
―yellow‖ and treat it as a pure color. In phrases such as kollo chibugwad ‗whitened yellow‘ note that -gwad is attached to
the modifier rather than to kollo.",[121]
"5.4 Grammar
5.4.1 Numbers (Ex. 5–15)
The numeral system in Kuna is complex. The numbers themselves are not difficult, but the system of prefixes is
difficult to control.
5.4.3.3 Basic number stem
The basic number stems of Kuna are used in counting items in much the same way as items are counted in
Spanish and English. The stems, however, are never used by themselves; they always occur with a prefix (see
5.4.1.3). It is important to memorize the basic number stems.
1. -gwen(na)
2. -bo
3. -pá
4. -bake
5. -atal(e)
6. -nerkwa
7. -kugle
8. -pabak(e)‗one‘
‗two‘
‗three‘
‗four‘
‗five‘
‗six‘
‗seven‘
‗eight‘5.4 Grammar479. -bakebak(e)
10. -ambe
11. -tula-‗nine‘
‗ten‘
‗twenty‘5.4.1.2 Word order of the number phrase
Unlike English or Spanish, the numeral in Kuna is used after the noun: noun + (prefix + number stem).
Examplenuzha + (kwa- + -bake) = nuzha kwabake‗four eggs‘5.4.1.3 Numeral prefixes
In Kuna, you must use one of the many numeral prefixes with the number stem. These prefixes are divided into
four main groups according to how a Kuna perceives the item he is counting, or according to the complexity of
the number:
1. Group I
Shape of object prefixes
2. Group II
Complex number-building prefixes
3. Group III
Measurement-related prefixes
4. Group IV
Time-related prefixes
In this lesson, Group I and Group II prefixes are discussed; Group III and Group IV prefixes are discussed in
Lesson VII.","[59, 60]"
"‗The baby is sick again.‘Exercise 10. Repetitive action frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it.
This exercise should be repeated several times.
ExampleTeacher: An mas kunnebal.
Student: An mas kunnebal.
1. An mas kunnebal.
‗I am going to eat food again.‘
2. An ob tignebal.
‗I am going to plant corn again.‘

It is important to recognize that suffixes occur in a specific order following the verb stem. To make the order of
suffixes easier to remember, suffixes are grouped below and the groups are numbered in the order in which they
appear following the verb stem. Group I comes directly after the verb stem, Group II follows Group I, etc:48
verb + Group I49 + Group II + Group III + ...
Group I - immediate future suffix -ne (see 3.4.2 and 10.4.1), completive aspect suffix -che/-zhe/-je (see
4.4.1), present progressive (see 6.4.2) and desiderative -bi/-pi (see 2.4.2). (See also Appendix F for
alternate order of -bi/-pi.)
Group II - group marker suffix -mal (see 8.4.3.1)
Group III - -bal/-pal ‗again‘ (see 10.4.3 and 10.4.4)
Group IV - -mo ‗too‘ (see 10.4.2.1)
Group V - future suffix -o (see 10.4.1.1 and 10.4.1.2)
Examples
1. Verb + Group I + Group III
Ome mol pakchabal.
‗The woman bought cloth again.‘
2. Verb + Group III + Group IV
Juan nebalmo.
‗John is going to go again too.‘
3a. Verb + Group I + Group III + Group IV
An mol maknebalmo.
‗I am going to sew again too.‘
b. Pan an mas kunnebalmo.
‗Tomorrow I am going to eat plantains again too.‘
4. Verb + Group III + Group V
Machi tagbalo.
‗The boy will come again.‘
5. Verb + Group IV + Group V
An mas kunmoo.
‗I will eat again (sometime).‘
6. Verb + Group I + Group II + Group III
Machergandin yannu aminebalmal.
‗The men are (all) going to go hunting peccary again.‘
7. Verb + Group II + Group III + Group IV
Machimaldina nemalbalmo.
‗The boys are (all) going to go again too.‘Exercise 12. Grouping of suffixes
The most common grouping of suffixes is the grouping of Groups I, III, and IV. For that reason, we will drill
these groups in the following exercise.
The student says Sentence a.
Tad cho chikne.
‗The grandfather is going to cut firewood.‘
Add Sentence b saying that the participant b is also going to perform the action of Sentence a.
‗The grandfather is going to cut firewood. The boy is
going to cut firewood, too.‘
Construct Sentence c which says that participant b is going to repeat his action.
Tad cho chikne. Machi cho chiknemo.","[135, 136]"
"1. Desire to repeat an action
In order to express a desire to repeat an action, the suffix -bal/-pal precedes the desiderative -bi/-pi.
ExampleMachi mas kunpalbi.",[310]
"Exercise 3. Oral reading of folktales
Students should take turns reading the folktale consecutively in order to practice correct intonation and gestures.",[284]
"‗The girl sold the blouse herself (of her own volition).‘19.4.3 Futility
An event or action may be perceived as being done in vain. This concept of futility is expressed by the adverb
pinche ‗in vain/for nothing‘ which, in this usage, normally occurs at the beginning of the sentence.
Examples
1. Pinche an ti.
‗I went for nothing.‘
2. Pinche an ul chobzha.
‗I might as well have not made the canoe.‘
However, when used as an adverb of futility, pinche occasionally occurs in the adverbial position.
Example
Antin pinche mani amidi.
‗I went in vain for the money.‘
Pinche can also mean ‗just (for no reason/purpose)‘. Intonation, context and word order provide clues to which
meaning it has.
19.4.3.1 Intonation clue
A disclaimer intonation (see 6.2.2) indicates ―just (without real purpose)‖ whereas a frustrated intonation
indicates the sense of ―in vain‖.
19.4.3.2 Contextual clue
If the speaker has indicated that some purpose gave rise to the action, the word pinche would have an ―in vain‖
connotation. If you surmise from the context that the action had no specific purpose, the connotation of pinche
is ―just (for no reason/purpose)‖.
19.4.3.3 Word order clue
When pinche occurs at the beginning of a sentence, it invariably means ―in vain‖.
19.4.4 Ability (Ex. 7–9)
Expressions which deal with a person‘s ability to carry out an action parallel the English expression, ―to be able
to....‖ In Kuna, various words are used to describe innate ability, capacity to perform, and an acquired skill.
19.4.4.1 Ability in the five senses (innate ability)
The five basic senses are described in Kuna by two verbs: tak ‗to see‘ (atak ‗to look at‘) and ito ‗to
hear/feel/taste/smell‘. The ability to use the senses is expressed by the use of the verb mag ‗to be able to‘ which
usually precedes the verb of sense.
Examples
1. Machi toto mag take.
‗The little boy is able to see.‘
2. Machi mag atak.
‗The boy is able to look at (things).‘
3. Punadin mag ito.
‗The girl can hear/feel/smell/taste.‘
Conversely, innate inability to use the senses is expressed by aku ‗to be unable to‘.
Examples
1. Punadin aku immal tak.
2. Machidin aku ito.",[272]
"‗Where are/is (you/he) going?‘
‗What did (you/he) make?‘
‗What (how) do/does (you/he) say?‘
‗Who arrived?‘
‗When did (you/he) arrive?‘2) Form of amplificatory questions
To form an amplificatory question, the appropriate question word is used and the verb about which more
information is wanted is repeated. The subject is usually omitted.",[53]
"‗The fish won‘t bite, the sabalos.‘
‗The people have already left, the boys.‘
‗People have arrived, chiefs.‘Exercise 25. Postpredicate position (subject specific) substitution drill
The teacher says the sentence and the student selects an appropriate specific subject from the list below and puts
it in the postpredicate position of the sentence.
ExampleTeacher: Tule ormapukwa.
Student: Tule ormapukwa; macherganbi.
Subject
1. macherganbi
‗only the men‘
2. omegan
‗the women/girls‘
3. punamal
‗the young women/girls‘
4. nuskan
‗the children‘
Statement
1. Tule ormapukwa.
‗The people are discussing (in a meeting).‘
2. Tule neg turwinai.
‗The people are sweeping the town.‘
3. Tule mol enuknai.
‗The people are washing clothing.‘
4. Tule turtanai.
‗The people are learning.‘Exercise 26. Postpredicate position (subject generic) drill
The teacher gives the sentence and the student substitutes a generic subject in the main part of the sentence and
moves the specific subject to the postpredicate position.
ExampleTeacher: Chule noni.
Student: Immal noni; chule.
Subject
1. immal
‗things/animal‘
2. tule
‗person/people‘
3. iwen
‗what‘s-its-name‘
Statement
1. Chule noni.
‗The paca arrived.‘
2. Nuskan todonani.
‗The children are playing.‘
3. Machergan arpanani.
‗The men are working.‘
4. María mol enuknai.
‗Mary is washing clothes.‘
5. Chigli namanai.
‗The wild turkey is calling (singing).‘
6. Yannu nas.
‗The peccary passed by.‘
Similarly, a direct object may be highlighted by stating it in a generic term in the simple sentence and stating a
specific term in the postpredicate position. Such a generic term as immal ‗animal‘ may be used. The long or
short form of the specific noun may be used where applicable. The short form of the specific term refers to a
class of objects whereas the long form refers to an animal within the class.
In many cases, however, the specific form of the object is not withheld because of a desire to emphasize the
object, but rather the generic form accompanied by a verb may convey a single concept. One such phrase is
immal pak meaning ‗to shop‘ rather than ‗to buy something‘; similarly immal amine means ‗to hunt‘ rather
than ‗to look for something‘. In sentences using the generic term and accompanying verb to convey a single
concept, the purpose of the postpredicate position is clarification.",[255]
"17.4 Grammar
In this lesson, we discuss the postpredicate position in the sentence. In Kuna, information which is to be
highlighted or which is to be made more clear, is placed at the end of a sentence. Thus, a sentence can comprise
either a simple sentence or a simple sentence followed by a postpredicate element. Any one element of a given
sentence may appear in this position.
The postpredicate element is usually separated from the main part of the sentence by a semi-colon in writing; in
speaking, there is a slight pause before it. This element is said with a different intonation pattern than the pattern
used in the main sentence.
17.4.1 Uses of postpredicate position (Ex. 4)
The postpredicate position is used for highlighting or emphasis, for redistribution of information in order to
avoid information overload, or for clarifying.
17.4.1.1 Highlighting or emphasis
Information which the speaker feels needs further emphasis or highlighting may be placed in the postpredicate
position. For example, we will examine the following sentence.
Example
Machi nakwal chule amine, mutik.
‗The boy is going to hunt paca upriver tonight.‘
In English and Spanish, the speaker may emphasize one element of a sentence by putting a heavy stress on the
word to be emphasized as it is spoken. In Kuna, emphasis may be placed on any of the words in the sentence by
placing that word after the predicate. In the example, the word mutik ‗tonight‘ is emphasized.
17.4.1.2 Information overload
Kuna places a limit on the number of elements that can be placed in one sentence, including the number of
adjectives or adverbs modifying a given element. An item of information which exceeds the limit of pieces of
information permitted in a Kuna sentence, i.e., the information overload, may be placed in the postpredicate
position. If the information overload exceeds one item, the information should be distributed between two or
more sentences.
A chronic error made by people learning to speak Kuna is that of trying to place all the information relative to a
situation into one sentence. A similar situation arises in English and Spanish when a speaker strings many
clauses, adjectives, or adverbs together without pausing or changing emphasis. In either case, the listener
becomes confused and does not understand the sentence.",[243]
"‗I bought the female (of a pair).‘
‗Please give me the short machete.‘18.4.5 Postpredicate position of basic elements (Ex. 8–20)
In Lesson XVII, general guidelines for using the postpredicate position were discussed. In this lesson,
guidelines specific to the basic elements of the sentence -- subject, direct object, and predicate -- are discussed.
18.4.5.1 Subject may be omitted in the simple sentence and unexpanded in the postpredicate
position
If the subject is omitted in the main clause, a very rare occurrence, it is stated in the postpredicate position
accompanied by one of the topic marking suffixes: -de/-te or -din/-tin (see Appendix E, 1 and 4).",[262]
"‗You tell me, in order that I will not forget.‘Exercise 13. Purposive suffix -gal/-kal frame drill
The teacher says Sentence 1 and the student repeats it; the teacher says Sentence 2 and the student repeats it,
etc. This exercise should be repeated several times.

"15 COMMANDS
15.1 Dialogue
The giving of orders and commands is important in every culture. Each culture has ―acceptable‖ ways to give a
command, which may vary according to the situation or the relationship of the speaker to the listener.
‗Boy, come (here)!‘1. Chief:
¡Machi, tag!
The boy comes to the chief.
2.
3.","[205, 206]"
"11610.4 Grammar11710.3 Culture
A Kuna is expected to ask for permission from the chief, in order to go on a trip. Permission is usually
requested at a town meeting. If, however, the necessity for the trip is urgent, the permission may be given at any
time. In requesting permission for the trip, the person is expected to give the destination and purpose of the trip,
and the length of time he expects to be away from the village.
When there is a message to be sent, the chief asks someone to hand-carry the message. The chief may only
request, he cannot demand, that someone take the message.
A Kuna, generally, does not travel alone. He travels with one or more companions. This aspect of the culture is
an important one to you, especially if you are requesting that a job be done in another area, or if you are
requesting a guide. A Kuna guide expects a companion to go with him, in order that he does not need to return
from your destination alone. Both the guide and the companion are given wages.","[129, 130]"
