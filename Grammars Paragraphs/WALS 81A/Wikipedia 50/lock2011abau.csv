Ukarumpa, Papua New GuineaPapers in the series Data Papers on Papua New Guinea Languages express the
authors’ knowledge at the time of writing. They normally do not provide a
comprehensive treatment of the topic and may contain analyses which will be
modified at a later stage. However, given the large number of undescribed languages
in Papua New Guinea, SIL-PNG feels that it is appropriate to make these research
results available at this time.

One may exchange the positions of the subject and object to give a
more prominent role to the subject. In OSV order, the object NP is nearly
always topicalised and the subject NP is not, because the subject is treated200as new information as is shown in (38). (For more discussion, see
counterexample of a non-topicalised fronted object NP (19) in §8.4, and
also §6.5.1 and §8.6.)

Neutral order in Abau is SOV, but this order can readily be altered for
pragmatic reasons. Background or given information is placed at the
beginning of the sentence and topicalised accordingly. Foreground or
prominent information is placed preceding the verb phrase. The phrase
that immediately precedes the VP forms the comment of the utterance.

segments. In terms of the pragmatics of the communication situation it201means that given or background information is clearly distinguished from
new or foreground information. Constituents containing new information
are never topicalised and precede the verb phrase. Topicalised constituents
conveying given information are found clause-initially. A topicalised
constituent can only precede, not follow, a non-topicalised constituent
within the clause.","[213, 214, 215]"

1.1 Location and population
Abau is a language spoken by more than 7000 people in Sandaun
(formerly West Sepik) Province, Papua New Guinea (see map 1). The
language area consists of the villages to the immediate east and west of
the Green River Station, as well as the villages along the Sepik River and
its tributaries, starting at the border with Indonesian Papua (the Indonesian
province of Papua, formerly Irian Jaya) all the way down to the border
with the East Sepik. The area depends mainly on air transport for supplies,
since there are no roads to connect the Green River Area with the coast
and transport via the Sepik River has proven to be troublesome.
MAP 1: THE ABAU AREA WITHIN PNG121.2 Language name
The language name Abau means infertile land. It is any area of open
grassy land without trees that cannot be used for food gardens. The more
than 1 kilometre long Green River Airstrip was built on such land. The
local people continued to refer to the area as Abau, and consequently the
Green River Station Area with its airstrip became known as Abau. The
name eventually transferred to the people group and the language. (The
word Abau is also used adverbially to indicate barrenness in a woman.
When following the word makwey ‘head’ it means bald.)1.3 Affiliation and earlier studies
In Wurm’s classification system (Laycock 1973; Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975; Wurm 1982), Abau is classified as an isolate at the
lowest level within the Upper Sepik Stock, Upper Sepik Super-stock,
Sepik sub-phylum, Sepik-Ramu phylum.
More recent research by Foley (2005) and Ross (2005) regards Abau
as a member of the Sepik family, related to other languages of the upper
and middle Sepik river valley, and the Sepik hill country, but not to the
languages of the Lower Sepik or Ramu families.
There have been several previous attempts at describing the Abau
language, but little published research. Wordlists were collected by patrol
officers F.R. Cawley (1919) and N.J. Cavanagh (1961); Cawley published
his wordlists in several Papua Annual Reports between 1917 and the
1930s. Kay Liddle, who was the missionary at Green River in 1960-62 for
Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML), filled seven notebooks with
texts, typical constructions, a phonemic statement and the beginnings of a
dictionary. However this material has never been published. 1
Three linguistic surveys of the language have been published. Loving
and Bass (1964) conducted a survey on behalf of the Australian
administration; they refer to the language as “Green River”, and note that
if administrative officers at Green River station learned the language, they
would be able to communicate with 3/5 of their administrative area. The
second was conducted by Donald Laycock of Australian National
University, who published a brief wordlist (Laycock 1965a) and
1Information compiled from Loving and Bass (1964); Laycock (1973); Carrington (1996).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

When the object NP is no longer topicalised, a subject needs to be
expressed in order to create a grammatically correct sentence. In (51), a
subject (filled by hakwe ‘1S.SUB’) is required since the NP object hye
‘3S.M’ is not topic-marked.

In (53), the first two NPs are topicalised. Within the predication they
fill the semantic function of respectively agent and patient but they are not
syntactically marked for subject and object. The listener is able to assign
the roles of agent and patient based on the logics of the semantics rather
than word order. (It is possible to reverse the order of the two first NPs
with the same marking). The speaker suppresses in this way the
prominence of both NPs, enabling the time constituent preceding the VP
enekwei kamonaw (in one day) to be the most prominent constituent of the
sentence.","[339, 340]"
"6. Clause
6.1Clause typesAbau only manifests two basic clause types. The verbless clause and
the verbal clause. Both clause types can be divided in a topic part and a
comment part. The first clause type consists of a topic constituent with a
juxtaposed comment constituent without a verb phrase or only
accompanied by the existential-stative verb lwak. The verbless clause has
two basic constituents: an optional topic constituent (although it always
needs to be understood) and an obligatory comment constituent.
The verbal clause always has a verb phrase which is the nucleus of the
verbal clause (see §4.3). This clause type follows SOV order by default
and displays the syntactic marking of subject and object.
The verbless clauses are discussed first (see §6.2). Then constructions
with the stative verb lwak are examined (see §6.3). These constructions
are very similar to the verbless clauses. Lastly, verbal clauses are
discussed (see §6.4).","[201, 202]"

‘He planted his garden (like this) the way he had seen in his
uncle’s village.’8.6 Decreasing or increasing the prominence of
sentence constituents
Predications, nearly without exception, contain a topic and a comment
component. The speaker makes choices in what he marks as topic or
comment. The outcome of these choices determines the prominence of the
various sentence constituents. There are various ways to raise or lower the
prominence of the constituents.
The most common order within Abau is SOV, but this order can
easily be changed to OSV. The syntactic role of NPs is not determined by
their place within the sentence but by their NP marking. As stated before,
nearly all NPs are marked syntactically and/or pragmatically. A large
percentage of NPs is marked for either subject or object, and the speaker
might make use of SOV or OSV order depending on the prominence he
wants to assign to the NPs (see §8.6.1). NPs which are not marked for
subject or object are very often topicalised by general topic markers
(§3.6). In spite of this lack of syntactic marking, these NPs can still have
patient or agent function, which is mostly determined by the context.
Their marking, or lack of marking, also determines how NPs are given
more or less prominence (see §8.6.2).","[337, 338]"
"8.6.1 Changing prominence of subject
Normal order within Abau is SOV, but based on prominence choices
a speaker can change this order. In (47), the order is changed to OSV. The
object NP Keno se kokwe is obligatorily topicalised, because it has been
left-located and is therefore placed in the topic part of the sentence (see325§8.3). The topicalised object precedes the non-topicalised subject ur hiy
‘vine 3S.SUB’, and as a result the subject is part of the comment part of the
sentence (see §8.4). The subject NP becomes the most prominent NP at the
expense of the object NP, which would have been the most prominent
constituent in an SOV clause.

‘In regard to Keno, (it was) a vine (that) wrapped around him

In the example above the subject was given more prominence. It is
also possible to suppress the subject. A subject has to be expressed when
the object is not topicalised, but one can omit the subject if the object NP
is topicalised by -kwe. In examples (48) and (49) respectively, hmekwe
‘3PL.OBJ.TOP’ and hye kokwe ‘3S.M.OBJ.TOP’ are understood to undergo
the events encoded in the respective VPs. This construction is widely used
when there is no need or no desire to express the agent of the predication.

"6.5.4 Constituents that can follow a non-topicalised
object NP
The object NP in a transitive clause tends to be the new information
the speaker wants to convey, and as a result the speaker will move this NP
towards the VP. It is therefore most often the object NP that immediately
precedes the verb phrase. It is possible for the subject NP to immediately
precede the verb if the speaker want to give more prominence to the agent
than to the object NP. However, as we saw above, the OSV order requires
that the object NP becomes topicalised.
There are three constituents that can follow a non-topicalised object
NP and immediately precede the verb phrase. Since they follow a non-209topicalised NP, they cannot be topicalised as well. The three clause
constituents are:
1. Adverbial, demonstrative and interrogative modifiers
(§4.4, §4.4.2 and §7.5.3). Ex.(52) and (53);
2. Incorporated nouns (§3.11.1). Ex. (54) and (55);
3. Postpositional noun phrases (§3.9). Ex. (56), (57), (58)
and (59).
6.5.4.1 Adverbial modifier preceding the VP
In (52), the adverbial modifier puraw occurs between the NP object
and the VP:

6.5.4.2 Incorporated nouns preceding the VP
In (54) and (55), the incorporated nouns eheyr ‘crying’ and kar
‘gladness’ occur between the NP object and the VP. An incorporated noun
does not refer to a specific identifiable entity, but helps to define or
complete the meaning of the verb.","[222, 223]"
"3.4.1 Numerals and NP order
Numerals follow the head noun of a noun phrase, and agree in class
with the noun they modify. (The twelve noun classes are discussed in
section §3.4.3). The Abau number system is limited in its scope. English
and Tok Pisin numbers are used for numbers above twelve, and often even
for numbers lower than twelve. Traditionally, there was no easy way to
express quantities above 20 or even above 12. The use of higher numbers
has been mainly introduced through the formal school system which is in
English. Abau speakers will therefore use the English forms of the
numerals even if the pronunciation of the numerals is affected by their use
of Tok Pisin and Abau. The use of the loanword numeral apparently
triggers English and Tok Pisin grammatical ordering. When an Abau
numeral is used the numeral will follow the noun as in (41).

Abau numerals are in reasonably frequent use up to five. The numbers
six to twelve are used to a much lesser extent. Above that, the numeral for5520 is sometimes used. Table 18 indicates the various ways numbers from
4-12 as well as 20 can be expressed.

systems’. He says “the latter are used only for direct counting, or
‘mapping’ of a set of objects against some other measuring code. There
are no ‘numerals’ in a tally system, so that one may not receive a reply to56the question ‘how many?’, or find the points of the tally-system qualifying
nouns, as do true numerals. The typical tally-systems of languages of the
New Guinea area are the ‘body-parts’ counting systems.” (Laycock 1975:
219). Later, he mentions Abau as an example of a language which has
both a body-parts tally-system and a numeral system which is quinary (i.e.
has distinct numbers up to 5) (Laycock 1975: 222).
The numbers below have been observed in contexts where they
qualify nouns. This might not have been always the case. Abau speakers
have been observed to think for a short while before they can match
numbers above five with the corresponding Abau number expressions.
The attempt to use Abau number expressions to modify nouns might be
the result of education and numeracy in the English language. It has been
observed that many Abau speakers use English numerals for quantities
above five. Abau numerals are used as the following example from a
written story illustrates:

‘Fish got into (the net) to this degree, five pikes, one catfish
and ten weir fish.’3.4.3 Abau numerals one, two and three
Nouns can be divided into two groups on the basis of their gender
(masculine and feminine). They can also be divided into twelve groups on
the basis of what numeral they occur with. These numerals are in
Aikhenvald’s terminology numeral classifiers (Aikhenvald 2000: 17).
Whereas the gender of a noun is indicated through noun phrase
markers, the numeral class of a noun is determined by the set of numerals
used for 1, 2, and 3. These class concordances are only expressed by the57first three numbers. Numbers above four (see Table 18) can be used to
modify all countable nouns.
The order in which the twelve numeral classes are listed below
follows Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 745-746). The numeral classifiers
in class 1 to 7 mark relatively large groups of nouns, while the numeral
classifiers in class 8 to 12 can only be used with a small number of nouns.
This is in all likelihood caused by the fact that the numeral classifiers in
class 8 through 12 express many more specifics than only quantity. Not
only their number, but also their grouping (e.g. bundles), or their partition
(e.g. chopped-up parts) can be in focus. In English, grouping words like
flock, bunch, bundle, etc. only occur with a limited number of nouns.
Similarly, it can be assumed that Abau numeral classifiers that express
specifics about the form or compilation of the noun they modify have a
very limited distribution.
Criteria for the different classes are related to humanness, surface,
grouping, dimensionality, and extendedness. Countable nouns which
cannot be classified by their physical appearance are not restricted to one
class; they belong to classes 2, 3 or 4.
The distinction between human and non-human within the numeral
classifiers is observed by all speakers, but young people do not seem to be
aware of all the other distinctions. They tend to overuse class 2 as a
default for nearly all non-human nouns.

chapter, in spite of the fact that many of the NP markers which carry
information on the gender and number of a noun have not been discussed.
This order has nevertheless been chosen, since a treatment of the NP final
markers, numerals and adjectives cannot be done without a proper
understanding of the noun word.","[55, 56]"
"3.2.4 Exocentric noun compounds
At least two types of exocentric compound nouns have been observed
where the constituents making up the compound noun belong to different
word classes.
1. A juxtaposed verb and noun forming a compound noun, whereby
the verb modifies the noun for category. (30)
2. A juxtaposed modifier and noun forming a compound noun,
whereby the modifier modifies the noun category. (31)

system of numeral classifiers, as do the related languages Iwam,
Wogamusin and Chenapian (Laycock and Z’graggen 1975). This feature
is also characteristic of some Indic, Dravidian, Iranian and Arawak (South
America) languages (Aikhenvald 2000: 185). As stated before, number
and gender are not marked on the noun word itself but are indicated by
pronouns, demonstratives, numerals and other grammatical markers that
follow the noun. The relationship between gender and number classifiers
is discussed §3.4.6.",[60]
"1.7 Typological overview of Abau
Abau has nominative-accusative orientation in both its syntax and its
case marking. Default ordering of arguments is Subject Object Verb
(SOV). This ordering frequently varies for pragmatic reasons. Topic is
overtly marked on noun phrases, and is clearly distinguished from subject.
The presence or absence of topic marking on NPs divides every
predication into a left-located topic-marked component and a right-located
comment.",[22]

De Vries (2005: 367) makes the point that Papuan languages
generally give the noun phrase a low priority.
In the majority of Papuan languages the verb is the head
of the verbal clause, and the only obligatory constituent.
The nominals in the clause could be considered optional
modifiers of this head… Many Papuan languages avoid
nouns and anaphoric use of independent pronouns to an
extreme extent in referent tracking, especially in the
tracking of active or given subject and object referents.
Abau does not fit this particular categorization of Papuan languages.
Clauses in Abau without a noun phrase are extremely rare. Also noun
phrases which are not overtly marked for their specific role are relatively
rare. The vast majority of noun phrases are marked for their pragmatic,
semantic or syntactic function to such an extent that the unmarked noun
phrase stands out because of its relative rareness.
Abau has a rich inventory of markers which occur by themselves NP
finally and which contain much grammatical information. Himmelmann
(2001: 838-839) calls these syntactic noun phrase markers pronominal
articles and Tupper (2009) makes mention of the usage of similar
pronominal articles in the neighbouring Namia language.
The vast majority of Abau noun phrases occur with a terminal phrase
marker. They can be non-syntactic pragmatic markers (§3.6 and Table
23), syntactic markers (§3.7, §3.8 and Table 28), and semantic markers
indicated by postpositions (§3.9 and Table 29). The tables referred to give
exhaustive lists of the various categories. We have analysed all the
pronominal forms listed in §3.6 through §3.9 as NP markers rather than as
a pronominal copy NP.
Noun phrases with zero marking are relatively rare. Within a narrative
text less than 10% of the noun phrases have zero marking (see §3.11).
3334Pragmatic marking is realised with the help of the topic marker -kwe
which cannot occur by itself, but is always suffixed to a pronoun.
The NP final marking not only marks the NP for its syntactic, semantic
and/or pragmatic role, but in most cases also reflects the gender and/or
number of the head of the NP. Many of these markers are also affixed for
demonstrative force. These demonstratives need to be explained against
the background of their counterparts which do not have deictic force. For
that reason the demonstratives are not in one section but are discussed in
various sections. The manner demonstrative in §3.5.5, the non-syntactic
demonstrative in §3.6.2, the syntactic demonstrative in §3.8.
Summary overview of Chapter 3:
It basically describes the structure and function of nouns and noun
phrases. It includes sections on the form and use of personal pronouns
(§3.1); the form, use and gender of the noun (§3.2, §3.3); numerals (§3.4)
and adjectives (§3.5). An extensive overview of all pragmatic (§3.6),
syntactic (§3.7, §3.8) and semantic (§3.9) noun phrase markers. The
chapter concludes with a full discussion of the structure of the noun
phrase (§3.10) and the absence of NP marking (§3.11).","[45, 46, 47, 48]"
"6.5.1 Positioning of subject and object
Neutral or frequently observed order within the clause places the
subject before the object. The verb phrase occurs clause-finally. In (39),
the object kuey me ‘grubs PL-OBJ’ follows the subject hano sa ko orih
hiykwe ‘my wife’s father’.

The order of subject and object can be reversed, and that nearly
always results in the topicalisation of the object NP. As a result of the
reversal the subject will immediately precede the verb phrase and cannot
be topicalised any longer. In (41), kuey me ‘grubs PL-OBJ’ is marked by
the feminine topic marker kokwe and precedes the non-topicalised subject.
As a result the subject becomes more prominent and emphasised.",[215]

The prefix hiy- ‘CAUS’ implies a subject which controls or causes the
event or state expressed by the predicate. In (11), the prefix hiy- occurs
twice. In both instances it refers to the fact that the agent controls or
causes the dog to hunt. Ki ley ‘hunting’ (literally ‘ground go’) is expressed
as ki hiy-ey to convey the control of the hunters over the dog. The same is
true for hiy- in non-hiy-naw. The prefix hiy- implies the presence of a
constituent that is under the control of the agent. The constituent that is
under the control of the agent is always animate and frequently human, as133can been seen from other examples in this paper: e.g. (53), (12) in §5.2.1,
and (46) in §5.3.2.
The prefixes saw- ‘SPD’ and kor- ‘LIM’ assign to the verb increased
speed and limitation of involvement, respectively. Examples can be found
elsewhere: (15), (73) in §7.4.2, (53) in §8.6.2, and (62) in §10.2.3, and
Table 5: Deletion of verb-initial l when prefixed.
4.2.1.1 Preferred order of verbal prefixes
The preferred order of verbal prefixes observed in natural texts is
summarised in Table 35. The prefixes kor- ‘LIM’ and hiy- ‘CAUS’ have
been placed on separate levels of the table, since their ordering in relation
to the other prefixes could not be established. These two prefixes have not
been observed to co-occur with kiy- ‘ACT’, saw- ‘SPD’, non- ‘DU’ or with
each other.

prefixes in Table 35 is established, there are no examples of a complete
string of all possible combinations. Examples (13), (14) and (15)

relatively few examples of contrastive lexical tone pairs have been
discovered so far”. Laycock and Z’graggen (1975: 744-5) queried the
correctness of Bailey’s claim that Abau was tonal, since it countered a
previous statement by Laycock (1965b) that Abau, Iwam and Wogamusin
are not tonal. Foley cites Bailey’s observations (1986:64). We have found
no evidence of a system of lexical tone or for the tone distinctions on
nouns and verbs that were presented by Bailey (1975: 32-37). The
minimal pairs Bailey listed all proved to be incorrect interpretations, see
Lock (2007: 21-22).
The stress in Abau always occurs word initially. Bailey never
commented on stress. Laycock (1965b) states that stress occurs word
initially, or occurs on the second syllable when the word contains /ə/. As
stated before, the current analysis does not have this central vowel. Six of
the seven examples with /ə/ mentioned by Laycock (1965b:117) are
analysed currently as /o/. These words have the stress on the first syllable
(e.g. hohkwe ‘the two of them’). The phoneme /ə/ in the seventh word is
analysed as /ow/ (low ‘to defecate’).
In defining the syllable we will rely on a basic phonological
assumption, that the same sequential constraints which operate at the
beginning of a word are also operative at the beginning of a syllable, even
if this syllable does not occur word initially. Similarly, the same21sequential constraints which operate at the end of a word should be
operative at the end of a syllable.
The following word initial consonant clusters have been observed.
When they occur word medially, they are analysed as occurring syllable
initially.

long orthography conference was organised in Yabru village which was
attended by educated and influential Abau speakers. The goal was to
determine the orthography of the Abau language on the basis of long word
lists that focused on phonemes in various environments and on particular
contrasts and minimal pairs. It also exposed the conference participants to
the various ways Abau people had spelled in testing situations. See Lock
(1993) for more information on the procedures and the reasons behind this
orthography conference.
Based on the recommendations of this conference, the orthography
follows the phonemic analysis with two exceptions:
1. The phoneme /r/ is represented in the orthography by <r>,<l> and <d>.
The following spelling rules determine the available alternatives:
a. Word initial /r/ is written as <l>.
e.g. /reir/ ‘take out’ is spelled as: <leir>
b. /r/ is written as <d> preceding /n/
e.g. /yorney/ ‘finger’ is spelled as: <yodney>
c. /r/ is written as <r> elsewhere.
e.g. /hror/ ‘the two of us’ is spelled as: <hror>
2. Word initial clusters of a high vowel and a low vowel are written with
an extra word initial semi-vowel that will agree with the high vowel for
the feature [back]. Thus:
a. /#iV/ is written as <yi>V
e.g. /ia/ ‘fire’ is spelled as: <yia>
b. /#uV/ is written as <wu>V
e.g. /ueir/ ‘garden’ is spelled as: <wueir>2.5Word boundaries and stressThe phonological word is defined as a unit with one primary stress. In
Abau, primary stress is associated with the first syllable of the
phonological word. The syllable with primary stress is assigned higher
pitch and intensity than the other syllables. The lowest pitch occurs on the
last syllable.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"8.2Sentence structureDik’s language-independent pattern-schema can be applied to the
Abau sentence structure. His basic schema is: THEME, PREDICATION,
TAIL (Dik 1980: 15).
The same schema expressed with more detail (Dik 1980: 20)
P2, P1 (V) S (V) O (V), P3
This can be adopted for the Abau language to: P2 , P1 S O V , P3
The THEME is expressed by the left-dislocated P2 position and the
TAIL by the right-dislocated P3 position. The PREDICATION is everything293in between. In this schema, S and O stand for the neutral or unmarked
positions of Subject and Object. The V indicates the position of the verb
phrase. P1, P2, and P3 indicate special positions used for special purposes,
and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation. P1 is the clause
internal topic, the P2 position is used for elements which are leftdislocated, i.e. they are outside the intonational boundaries of the clause
(cf. Dooley and Levinsohn 2001: 67-69) and the P3 is the right-dislocated
constituent or tail.
Dik (1980: 16) defines THEME and TAIL as follows:
The theme specifies the universe of discourse with respect
to which the subsequent predication is presented as
relevant.
The tail is defined as an “afterthought” to the predication,
information meant to clarify or modify it.
Dik gives an English example that follows the schema THEME,
PREDICATION, TAIL.
(1) Theme (P2)
Predicate (P1 S O V)
Tail (P3)
As for my brother, he never saw her again, the poor child.
He adds that in certain languages, constructions like this may be
strongly marked or even at the fringe of grammaticality, whereas in other
languages, they may almost represent the usual way of constructing a
sentence. He also states that the theme will very often be some term
presented in “absolute” form, i.e. without any specified semantic or
syntactic function (1980:16).
As for the predication marked by P1 S O V, Dik (1980:20-21) states
the following:
The positions marked by S, V and O are called “pattern
positions” for Subj, Verb and Obj. These are the positions
where constituents of this type end up if they have not
been brought into P1 by the rules determining the use of
this special initial position.
Dik further comments about the P1 position that “either Topic or
Focus, or both will often favour the initial position in the clause, if this is
available.” In Abau, the P1 position is always a topicalised constituent and
never belongs to the comment part of the sentence.","[306, 307]"

As stated above, NPs consisting of a topicalised personal pronoun
could be analysed as having both syntactic and pragmatic marking, or as
having only pragmatic marking. Their position within the clause is the
determining factor. The personal pronoun NP needs to be followed by at
least one other topicalised constituent before it can be analysed as a
constituent that has lost its syntactic role.
The NP homkwe in (47) hosts the subject personal pronoun hom and
the topic marker -kwe. Since the topicalised NP immediately precedes a
phrase that is not topicalised (wayh seme ‘these yams’) one can conclude
that the topicalised NP homkwe ‘you’ functions as the subject of the
clause.

In ditransitive clauses the marking on the NP object and NP indirect
object is identical. The neutral or most frequently observed order of the
two arguments has the indirect object preceding the direct object, as in
(48). This feature of Abau syntax is consistent with the universal tendency
for indirect objects to precede direct objects, since indirect objects tend to
be higher on the animacy hierarchy (Hopper and Thompson2071980: 259-261). Usually indirect objects are [+human, +animate], in
contrast to direct objects, which are usually [-human, ranimate].

In (48), neither direct object nor indirect object is topicalised by -kwe.
They both mark information that the speaker treats as new. It is possible to
topicalise the indirect object and not the object. In (49), the topicalised
indirect object precedes the topicalised subject, while the object
immediately precedes the verb phrase without any topic marking. This
construction reduces the prominence of the recipient and raises the
prominence of the patient, since it is the only non-topicalised role within
the clause.

Although the indirect object usually precedes the direct object, the
speaker can move the indirect object closer to the verb phrase. The result
is that the prominence of the recipient is raised at the expense of the
prominence of the patient. In (50), the direct object (hno yeyk se kokwe) is
treated as given information, but the indirect object (hane) as new
information.","[219, 220, 221]"
"4.1.1 Determining the boundaries of the verb phrase
Verb phrase boundaries are defined with the help of three important
features. They are listed here in order of their usefulness in the
determination of verb phrase boundaries:
a. The beginning of the verb phrase is easily recognisable since it
always carries the most salient stress which is associated with the
highest pitch within the clause, see (1);
b. A number of markers which are not part of the verb phrase work
together to form negation and interrogative constructions that
enclose the entire verb phrase, see (2) and (3);
c. Phrases in Abau are frequently separated by distinct pauses. If
there is a pause, one can assume it marks the end of a phrase,
since a pause does not occur within a phrase. Not every phrase is
clearly separated by pauses, but there is often a distinct pause
between the last topicalised constituent within the clause and the
non-topicalised constituent following, see (4).
In (1), yaprue ‘good’ is not part of the VP since it does not carry the
most salient stress within the clause. The most prominent stress within the
clause is on lie ‘go.up’ and this signals the beginning of the VP. Therefore,
yaprue ‘good’ is analysed as a separate adverbial modifier modifying the
verb phrase.

yaprue 'lie.
aiai hiy ma saro so-mo-kwe
yaprue lie
food 3S.M RCM plant DDEM-GL.PL-TOP good
go.up
‘The food that he planted grew really well.’
Secondly, a number of constructions that mark negation or questions
make use of constituents that enclose the entire verb phrase.
In (2), the VP is embraced by two constituents that express negated
dynamic modality liy … ley ‘DYN … NEG’. The modal marker liy ‘DYN’ is
not part of the VP since it does not carry the highest pitch. The negation
word ley is not part of the verb phrase since it functions at sentence level.
The VP is underlined and the onset of the VP is marked by an apostrophe.",[138]

masculine, but NPs already marked for syntactic or semantic case are
always topicalised by the feminine topic marker.

As in (141) and (142), topicalised NPs which also host a semantic

NP with a semantic marker to occur more sentence initially, as is shown in
(143).

The subject demonstrative can occur in constructions with the
semantic case markers sok (exactness) and non (comitative) where the
demonstrative loses its subject force (compare §3.8.3). The construction
of a subject demonstrative followed by a topicalised semantic case marker
is rare and has only been observed for these temporal phrases. The bolded
NPs contain the subject demonstrative sohiy with the semantic markers sok
(144) and with non (145).

The standard NP occurs with an obligatory head, an optional pre-head
and potentially five optional post-head modifying constituents. The head
consists of a noun or a nominal compound. The highest pitch within the
noun phrase is on the first syllable of the head. The pre-head constituent is
a possessive modifier, realised by a genitive pronoun or by a genitive
prepositional phrase. The post-head modifying constituents describe the
nominal head, or its deictic position in the communication situation. The
constituents of the standard noun phrase are ordered in Table 30.
3.10.1.1 Pre-head constituents
The only phrase constituents able to appear before the head are
independent pronouns or phrases marked with the genitive suffix -o. In
(146), the first hano ‘my’ is an independent personal pronoun with
genitive marking, modifying the head noun sa ‘woman’. The second hano
is a genitive pronoun modifying kam ‘uncle’. The noun phrase hano kam
‘my uncle’ itself is modified by the genitive marker so. Together they
form a possessive phrase modifying the head noun ney ‘child’:

standard noun phrases are underlined and the head constituent is bolded.

3.10.1.3 Post-head constituents
Constituents following the head of the noun phrase include qualifiers,
numeral/quantifier, object/subject marker, semantic case role markers, and
topic markers.
The noun phrases in (146) and (149), as well as most of the NPs in
(150-153) have been analysed for constituent types in Table 31.","[117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122]"

It is possible to modify the head of a noun phrase with an embedded
clause that consists of an object complement clause plus the verb modified
by the complement clause. In order to demonstrate this a basic object
noun phrase is given in (37).

‘He saw a young woman.’
A noun phrase can be modified by an adjectival clause that marks
simultaneous or current action (§6.6.5). In (38), the underlined adjectival
clause hok le ‘3S.F come’ modifies the head of the noun phrase sa-sokruan
‘young woman’.

In (39), the object complement clause hu lows e is embedded within
the adjectival clause hok le. The complement clause modifies the
embedded clause for purpose. The noun phrase marker ke continues to
agree in gender and number with the head of the noun phrase sa-sokruan
‘woman-young’.","[375, 376, 377]"
"8.3.1NPs with a noun as headIn Table 52, topicalised noun phrases are divided into seven
categories based on the NP final marking:297

and peyr ‘firstly’ are zero markedZero marking7 NPs with zero marking but
followed by a distinctive pause,
separating the NP from the rest of
the predication (§3.11)Marked by distinctive pauseThe first five types of NPs are placed in a graded order for the degree
of background status. Noun phrases only marked for pragmatic role
(category 1 and 2) are likely to occur first within the topic slot of the
sentence. Topicalised noun phrases marked for syntactic or semantic case
(category 3, 4, and 5) will normally follow the NPs from the first two
categories. The last two categories mentioned (6 and 7) do no occur
frequently but are mentioned for the sake of completeness.
In general, the noun phrases in category 1 and 2 are higher in
background status than the noun phrases represented by category 3, 4 and
5. However, the decisive factor in determining the degree of background
status is not the marking but the position of the topicalised NP constituent
within the topic part of the sentence. The closer the constituent is near the
comment part of the sentence, the more it is removed from background298status. The last topic constituent of the topic part of the sentence is the
topicalised constituent that immediately precedes the comment part of the
sentence. This constituent is analysed as the P1 constituent in Dik’s
formula. In Abau, the P1 constituent is always topicalised, and so are all
the constituents preceding it, unless they are constituents belonging to
category 6 and 7. All constituents that precede this P1 constituent are
analysed as P2 constituents, although – as stated before – the Abau P2
seems to be too heavily marked to fit Dik’s definition of the P2 or Theme
constituent.
8.3.1.1 Category 1 to 5
As stated before, topicalised noun phrases marked for syntactic or
semantic case (category 3,4,5) normally follow NPs which are only
marked pragmatically (category 1 and 2).
In (2), the temporal NP, pokon kokwe, is only marked pragmatically
(category 1). It is followed by a NP that is both syntactically and
pragmatically marked (category 3). These two noun phrases together form
the topic slot of the sentence.

In (3), the expected order is observed: a topicalised NP only marked
pragmatically is placed before a NP marked pragmatically and
syntactically. The initial noun phrase is marked by the general masculine
topic marker, hokwe. The second NP is marked for subject and topic by
hiykwe.","[310, 311, 312]"
"6.6.1 Relative clauses preceding the head noun
Relative clauses preceding the head they modify are normally marked
by ma preceding the first verb. The relative clause follows SOV order and
it is important to note that the constituents of the relative clause cannot be
topicalised. The relative clause functions as a modifier for a head noun
that can be topicalised, but modifiers themselves (including the relative
clause as modifier) cannot be topicalised. In the examples below the
relative clauses are underlined, the head of the NP is bolded and if this NP
has a syntactic, semantic or pragmatic phrase marker it is bolded as well.
In (69) the head of the containing NP is yier. The relative clause
mango-now ma lorok precedes it. This construction, where the relative
clause precedes the head it modifies, occurs less frequently than the
construction where the relative clause follows the head it modifies.",[229]
"382Also the tail should not contain new information as the second clause in
the construction above clearly does.
Alternatively, analysing the first clause as a subordinate clause is also
problematic. This is because the first clause has no final clause marking
that is comparable to other subordinate clauses, but ends with a VP, like all
verbal main clauses.
In spite of their dependence on each other, it is deemed best to treat
both clauses as main clauses which together express the concept of ‘until’.
In (75), the first clause occurs with the restrictive manner adverb
senkinaw to express duration. This time the first clause is not marked by
the imperfective as in (74), but by the modal marker ey ‘INTN’ which often
has future reference. The second clause is marked for the perfective.
Together they express the concept of ‘until’.

10.1 General discourse features and
organisation
Common features of nearly all oral and written discourses include:
1. an introduction;
2. a plot or a theme with its supporting arguments;
3. a conclusion.
Many texts also have a final formulaic closing statement, which often
includes the restrictive manner adverb senkinaw ‘that is all’. For some
discourse genres the introduction and conclusion can be as short as one
sentence.
Discourses are organised either
a. iconically, mirroring the order of events in the real world; or
b. thematically around major topics and supporting points.
Iconically ordered narrative discourses and legends usually have a plot
(build-up, crisis, resolution) for the main body of the discourse. Other
discourse genres (descriptive, explanatory, hortatory) have a set of
supporting points or arguments centred around a macro-theme. Even
though either time-iconicity or thematicity is the primary organising
strategy, most discourses manifest elements of both strategies.","[395, 396, 397]"

"443.2.2 Compound nouns
There are many compound nouns in Abau. They are simply formed by
noun roots placed in juxtaposition. They can be distinguished from singlemorpheme nouns with the same number of syllables by their intonation
patterns. For example ompiy ‘skirt (grass)’ is a regular two syllable word,
but om-pi ‘village-ridge’ is a two syllable compound noun. The pitch
contrast between the two syllables within the first word is relatively small,
but very distinct in the compound noun. The second noun of a compound
noun sequence always carries a very distinct low pitch. This is further
exemplified by (22), where the pitch on the second noun yok ‘shoot’ is the
lowest within the utterance. This low pitch is marked with number 3 to
contrast with the last syllable of other two-syllable words that do not have
such a low pitch.

There are four types of semantic relationship encoded by endocentric
noun compounds in Abau. (The noun compound is called an endocentric
construction as both constituents are nouns and therefore belong to the
same word class.) Endocentric compounds encode four types of semantic
relationship, which are listed below.
1) Whole-part. The first noun modifies the second noun in a whole-part
relationship.
In (23) the compound noun omku-saw ‘banyan tree hole’ represents a
whole-part relationship.
(23) Homkwe hreme omkuw-saw
mon hiy-wayr.
hom-kwe hrom-e omkuw-saw
mon hiy-lwayr
2/3PL-TOP 1PL-OBJ banyan.tree-hole LOC CAUS-stay
‘They looked after us in a hole of the banyan tree.’
Other examples where the first noun modifies the second noun in a
whole-part relationship:45(24) now-ma
mango-i(lit. tree-leaf)‘leaf of a tree’(lit. mango-fruit)‘fruit of the mango tree’2) Specifier. The first noun modifies the second noun for category, e.g.
yeyk-yier ‘place to moor canoes’.
In (25), the initial noun of the compound noun yeyk-yier ‘place to
moor canoes’ specifies the category of the subsequent noun.
(25) Sawk omok yeyk-yier
mon hiy-ey.
sawk omok yeyk-yier
mon hiy-ley
CHD later
canoe-place LOC CAUS-go
‘Later they led us to the place where canoes are moored.’
Other examples where the first noun modifies the second noun for
category:
(26) mango-now (lit. mango-tree)
‘mango tree’
hoyow-wayh(lit. fun-friend)‘friend one jests with’3) Size. The second noun modifes the first noun for size, e.g. a-ney ‘small
house’.
Other examples:
(27) sa-ney
huok-waw(lit. woman-child) ‘girl’
(lit. pig-round)‘round sturdy pig’4) Generic category. Both nouns function equally in the compound to
express a generic category of entities e.g. uwr-sa ‘people’ (lit. manwoman) and ney-sa ‘family’ (lit. child-woman).
Other examples where two equal nouns combine to indicate a generic
category:
(28) yeik-ompow spear-arrow
‘weapons’
sune-ihaleg-hand‘body, or: body parts’In (29), two semantically different compound nouns are listed with
identical constituents in different order. Ney-sa is literally
‘child (or: small)-woman’
and
sa-ney
is
literally
‘womanchild (or: small)’. The meaning of each compound noun is determined by
its compound noun type.","[57, 58, 59]"

In (85), the embedded relative clause is negated. It is not possible for
the feminine topic marker kokwe to immediately follow an embedded
clause that has a negation marker. This is not surprising since the
imperfective negation marker pa is a clause marker, while the feminine
topic marker kokwe is a phrase marker. Based on the fact that the relative
clause marker ma occurs twice within the noun phrase, we need to
conclude that we have two embedded clauses within the noun phrase. The
first relative clause marker is part of the relative clause that modifies the
head of the noun phrase sa-nawp. ‘old woman’ The second relative clause
marker ma is part of the relative clause ma lwak, which has as its scope
the NP head plus the negated first relative clause. The feminine topic
marker kokwe terminates the NP and, as in the other two examples, agrees
in gender and number with the head of the NP sa-nawp ‘old woman’.

In (86), the underlined embedded phrase relativises an ellipted noun
which is understood as ‘the fact that’. It is possible to negate a relative
clause that modifies an ellipted noun as is demonstrated in (87). A relative
clause consisting of the relative clause marker ma and the stative verb
lwak follows the first embedded relative clause. The second relative
clause has as its scope the same head plus the first relative clause.

action
The adjectival clause discussed in this section is similar to the relative
clause in that the modifying clause appears between the head noun and the
NP marker which indicates the grammatical function of this head noun.
However, relative clauses are marked by the relative clause marker ma
and the adjectival clause discussed in the section does not make use of the224marker ma, which sets this modifying clause apart from the relative
clause.
The function of this modifying clause is not to identify a referent, but
to add extra information to an already identified referent. The verbal
action expressed in the adjectival clause takes place simultaneously with
the action of the clause it is embedded in.
In (88), the clause hyo wayh hiy kan ke lorok ho ‘his friend was
standing and making a rope’ is an embedded adjectival clause which is not
marked by the relative clause marker ma. The adjectival clause refers to
an action that is in progress simultaneously with the action of the main
clause as indicated by the verb phrase le ira ‘came look’. The object
marker se agrees in number and gender with the head of the noun phrase
wayh ‘friend’.

‘He came and saw his friend, who was standing and twisting a
ring rope (= used for climbing coconuts) at the base of a
papaya tree.’
In (89), the adjectival clause hiy naksaw ‘which was grunting’ is also
formed without the relative clause marker ma. The clause is therefore
analysed as indicating simultaneity in the actions of the main clause and
the adjectival clause.

(90).

constituent of a verbless clause
The comment constituent of a verbless clause can be modified with a
relative clause. It requires the use of the comitative postposition non
preceded by a syntactic NP marker. In order to understand this somewhat
complex construction, it is helpful to look at some examples that do not
contain relative clauses but that display a similar noun phrase marking.
As stated before most verbless clauses can be divided into a topic part
of often one, but possibly more topicalised constituents; and a comment
part which is basically a non-topicalised constituent which supplies a
comment on the most important topic constituent (See examples (1)-(4),
(6) and §6.2).
It is possible, though, to state only the comment, which means that the
verbless clause has no expressed topicalised constituent, but only a nontopicalised constituent. This often happens for titles of stories, or for short
headings that specify only the subject that will be discussed. The basic
construction of these type of clauses is as follows:
A noun word followed by a syntactic subject NP marker which is
marked by the comitative non. The syntactic marker loses it subject force
since it is marked by the postposition non.
In (91), the entire clause is analysed as the comment part. Therefore,
by definition, the NP marker hom ‘2/3PL’ is not topicalised. The NP marker
marks the head noun for number.","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239]"

3S.TOP*Topicalised NPs that have a subject personal pronoun as head will
always be given agent function within the sentence. However, a number307of examples have been observed in which the same personal pronoun
occurs twice within the sentence. It seems that the first occurrence of the
personal pronoun focuses on the topic function of the referred-to
participant, while the second occurrence of the same personal pronoun
focuses on the subject function of the referred-to participant.
In (16), the noun phrase hunkwe occurs twice. The first hunkwe occurs
before the topicalised noun phrase marked by mokwe. Although its
marking already sets the NP apart for agent function, it still seems that the
topic status rather than the agent function of the personal pronoun is in
focus. It is therefore marked as a P2 constituent. The second hunkwe is the
last topicalised constituent before the comment part of the sentence and is
therefore analysed as a P1 constituent. Its subject function is central here.

In (17), the NP preceding the temporal relative clause, hiykwe ‘he’ is
topic-marked, and is therefore a separate sentential constituent in the P2
position. The relative clause skul me ma lanio ira hokwe is also a P2
sentential constituent. The second hiykwe is a P1 constituent with subject
function within the main clause.

absence of the topic marker -kwe. The comment part is preceded by the
topic part of the sentence. The break between the topic component and the
comment component of the sentence is in nearly all cases marked by the
last constituent of the topic slot that hosts the constituent-final topic
marker -kwe.
Nearly all sentences occur with a topic and a comment part, but only
the latter is obligatory, as can be seen in (19). The example is taken from a
story in which a group of people cut trees in the forest until disaster hits.
Neither object NP nor the subject NP are topicalised; both belong to the
comment part of the sentence. It is very unusual to have a non-topicalised
NP object in a clause with OSV order. It is generally regarded as incorrect
grammar (see §6.5.1) but might be permitted here because it forms the309climax of the story. The speaker treats both noun phrases as new
information, and no topic markers are used.

prefix can co-occur with manner prefixes, as in (15), where the directional
prefix am- ‘near’ co-occurs with the modal prefixes saw- ‘SPD’ and nak‘ACC’.

distinct constituent categories. The only nuclear constituent is a minimum
of one verb from the first constituent category. Up to four verbs from this
category have been observed to co-occur within the verb phrase. The
second category consists of general qualifiers that qualify the verb for
quality or quantity. They cannot occur by themselves within the verb
phrase. The third category consists of a variety of modifiers that deal with
the three subcategories of participant interaction, time and appraisal of
process. The three subcategories can all be represented in a single verb
phrase and mostly in the order given, though exceptions to this ordering
have been observed.
As stated before, the perfective and imperfective are marked by
intonation contour. The basic contrast is the pitch over the final syllable of
the verb phrase. A large number of verb phrases only consist of members
of category one, but many verb phrases will also host members of
category two and three. The last constituent of the verb phrase is marked
for perfective or imperfective. This is not true when speech markers and
negation markers are added to the sentence. These markers are not part of
the verb phrase, but they (rather than the verb final constituent)
distinguish between perfective and imperfective (see §7.3 and §7.4).
Table 36 shows the three categories of constituent members along
with a number of examples. It should be noted that the lists of words
under the three subcategories of the third group are exhaustive. The
examples under the second category however, are part of a much larger
group with many members.
The three categories in Table 36 can be labeled as follows: category 1:
one or more verbs; category 2: qualifying adverbial modifiers; category 3:
reciprocal, temporal and evaluative modifiers.","[147, 148, 149]"
"6.6.2 Relative clauses following the head noun
In most cases the relative clause follows, rather than precedes, the NP
head it modifies. The relative clause comes between the head noun and
the NP marker or postposition which indicates the grammatical function of
the head.
The order of the relative clause and the head of the NP in example (69)
is reversed in (73) where the relative clause follows the head of the NP it
modifies. The relativiser in these constructions is also ma, and, as in all
relative clauses, none of the constituents of the relative clause can be
topicalised. The relative clause functions as an embedded modifier clause
within the NP, which has its own NP marking. In the examples below the
relative clause is underlined, the head of the NP is bolded and if this NP
has a syntactic, semantic or pragmatic phrase marker it is bolded as well.

The postposed relative clause functions as a constituent modifying a
NP. The NP can be topicalised, but as stated before, the relative clause that
functions as a modifier cannot. In (74), the modified NP is marked by the
NP final marker seme ‘DDEM.OBJ.PL’. This marker agrees in number with
the head of the NP now-i ‘tree fruit’ it modifies.",[231]

"3.6 Pragmatic NP markers with and without
demonstrative force
The next four sections will deal with all the NP final markers. They are
presented in order.
Section §3.6 deals with all the NP markers that occur NP finally which
are marked pragmatically but not syntactically. Table 23 gives an
overview of all possible non-syntactic pragmatic NP markers with and
without demonstrative force.
Sections §3.7 and §3.8 deal with all the NP markers that give the NP
syntactic function. For a summary overview of all syntactic NP markers
including syntactic demonstrative markers, see Table 28.
Section §3.9 deals with the markers for postpositional phrases. An
overview of all postpositions is found in Table 29.",[89]
"315In (30) above, the tail position is used for a participant that has been
introduced already and can be deduced from the context. The speaker
nevertheless adds the participant in the tail of the predication to rule out
any confusion.
Example (33) illustrates a similar point. One can delete the tail
without causing the sentence to be grammatically incorrect. The semantic
domain of the verb lwawk ‘step into’ anticipates an object that has sides.
This verb is frequently used with the noun yeyk ‘canoe’. In spite of the
fact that the listener can be expected to supply the location yeyk ‘canoe’,
the speaker still adds the information to rule out confusion.

In (34), a temporal NP occurs in the tail position. It is different from
example (33), where the information in the tail completes the thought
expressed in the main clause. In (34), the tail contains additional
information. Its absence would not lead to miscommunication, since the
main information preceding the P3 constituent is complete in itself. By
placing the additional information in the tail, the speaker keeps the central
information in the main clause concise and together.

It is relatively rare for the tail position not to be topicalised. The
pragmatic topic marker consigns background status to the topicalised316constituent. If the tail occurs without a topic marker, the status of the
constituent changes and it starts to have the capacity to mark new
information. Compare the following two examples:
Example (35) is part of a dialogue between two sisters. The tail could
have been deleted, as the listener only needed to keep track of two
participants.

In (36), the NP in tail position is not topic-marked and should
therefore not be treated as background information. Without the
information expressed in the tail, the listener could not have deduced with
certainty the identity of the recipient that kow ‘benefactive’ anticipated.

Although rare, a subordinate clause can be placed in tail position.
These clauses contain given information or information that can be easily317accessed by deduction. These clauses can be deleted without affecting the
grammatical correctness or intonation of the main clause.
The following two examples have been taken from the story “The two
brothers” (§11.1.1). In (37), a subordinate clause with ankin is placed in
tail position. As the context of the story is the shooting of over-flying
birds, the contents of the clause in P3 position can be deduced by the
listener.

‘Man, you should only shoot your very best, when a bird flies
near.’
A noun phrase that contains a relative clause can also occur in tail
position. In (38), the relative clause (bolded) modifies the head of the
noun phrase now ‘tree’.

garden middle LOC RCM stand 3S.M-OBJ
‘When they arrived in the garden, the younger brother
consequently showed the older brother - the large tree
standing in the middle of the garden.’318Examples (37) and (39) are taken from the same story about two bird
hunters. In (39), the NP in tail position ahney senkin senkin ‘all kinds of
birds’ is modified by the bolded relative clause. The P3 constituent (as all
P3 constituents) can be deleted without loss of grammatical correctness.
The object noun phrase in the P3 slot is not present in the main clause.
However, the referent ahney ‘birds’ is signalled in the main clause by
huon ‘OBJ moves to SUB’. The listener can deduce the arrival of the birds
from the context, but the added tail constituent completes the information
and rules out ambiguity.

their shelter), they saw (them) from far away, all kinds of
birds flying and coming towards them.’8.5.2 Tail constituents in clauses with transitive verbs
Instead of occurring as clauses embedded in the main clause, cause
and reason clauses are often extraposed from the main clause to P3, the
tail position in the sentence.
These cause and reason constructions are primarily encoded by
clauses that look like headless relative clauses (see §6.6.3). The tail
constituents are terminated by a demonstrative marked for either subject
or object. A subject demonstrative in final P3 position indicates cause, an
object demonstrative indicates reason. Both reason and cause P3
constructions are preceded by an adverbial causal demonstrative in the
main clause.
These reason and cause clauses in the tail position have the following
features:319a. The normal relative clause features: no internal topic marking on
any of the constituents; the use of the relativiser ma preceding the
verb phrase.
b. Tail final marking consists of a demonstrative marker that is
either marked for subject (cause) or object (reason).
c. The tail construction makes the goal or cause explicit that the
adverbial causal demonstrative (§4.4.3) in the main clause already
referred to.
In (40), the P3-final demonstrative marker sokwe signals object and
therefore the tail functions as a reason clause. The main clause contains the
adverbial causal demonstrative sokwe which expresses a causal relationship
between this main clause and what went before in the previous sentence, or
wider previous context. By adding the optional P3 constituent, the speaker
makes the reason for the laughter explicit.

‘So the crayfish laughed at the turtle, because she had rolled
into the water.’
The only difference between (40) and (41) is the final marking on the
P3 constituent. In (41), the clause-final demonstrative sohok signals
subject, and therefore the tail functions as a causal clause. The difference
is reflected in the alternative translation of these two examples. Like in
(40), the tail position is only added to avoid ambiguity, not to give totally
new information.","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333]"

3. Use of measurement and polar questions in verbless clausesVerbless clauses do differentiate between measurement and polar
questions in spite of the fact that verbless clauses do not differentiate
between perfective and imperfective aspect. When the interrogative
speech utterance marker is needed, only so, ko and mo are selected but
never o.
In (140), the interrogative pankaw occurs clause-finally in a verbless
clause. There is no co-occurring speech marker. The question is
understood as a polar question.

“Oo.”

7.5.3.4 Reason interrogative
The interrogative pro-word encoding reason consists of the nonhuman interrogative pay ‘what’ (derived from po-ay ‘Q-what’) followed
by the pronoun hokuaw ‘for what reason?’. Hokuaw ‘for what reason?’
has as constituents: the general topical marker ho- and -kuaw ‘for reason
of’. Hokuaw is used by itself at clause level. (See for further discussion
§6.7)288In (142) payhokuaw is used as an adverbial phrase.

In (144), payhokuaw functions as a conjunction. It is possible that this
use of the interrogative ‘why’ as ‘because’ had been influenced by Tok
Pisin, where the interrogatives bilong wanem ‘why’ and long wanem
‘because’ are used as a reason conjunction. Although the constituents of
payhokuaw ‘because/why’ correspond closely to the constituents of Tok
Pisin long wanem ‘why’, people believe that the usage of this word is true
Abau, pre-dating the advent of Tok Pisin in the area (§9.3.3).

7.5.3.5 Goal interrogative
The interrogative paneke ‘why’ is possibly derived from pay-nok e ‘in
order to do what’. The following sentence is correct in some dialects of
Abau.","[300, 301, 302]"
"294Dik clearly distinguishes between the pragmatic functions of TOPIC
and FOCUS, and comments that they can be only assigned to the
constituents of the predication proper. (1980:16)
The topic presents the entity “about” which the
predication predicates something in the given setting.
The focus presents what is relatively the most important
or salient information in the given setting.
Alternatively, and much more simply applied to Abau: topic is the
given entity the sentence is about and comment is the new information
stated about the topic. The concepts above are very helpful, since the
majority of constituents are clearly marked for topic or comment function.
The P3 (tail) position also features extensively. Furthermore, there is a
clear tendency that all constituents containing background information are
placed to the left.
However, the formulaic distinction between P2 and the rest of the
predication is too rigid and too absolute. Constituents that could
potentially be analysed as setting the theme for the predication are indeed
left-located, but these constituents are heavily marked for the pragmatic
function of TOPIC. This contradicts Dik’s assumption that these THEME
constituents are unmarked.
In Abau there is, however, a very sharp separation between the topic
part and the comment part of the sentence. The topic part contains
constituents that are nearly all without exception topicalised by some
marker that hosts the topic marker -kwe. In contrast, none of the
constituents within the comment part of the sentence can be topicalised.
The topic part of the sentence often contains more than one constituent
and one could make further distinctions between them in how they relate
to the rest of the clause. However, a distinction between a P2 (Theme)
constituent as different from a topic-marked P1 constituent would seem to
be artificial. It does more justice to the language to focus on the clear
dichotomy between the topic part and the comment part of the sentence.
In later discussions further distinctions between the constituents of the
topic part will be made, but not with the goal to distinguish between a P2
theme constituent and a topic-marked P1 constituent. In the examples
below constituents are labelled P2 and P1. This distinction is made on the
following basis: the last topicalised constituent within the topic part of the
clause is labelled P1; all topicalised constituents preceding P1 are labelled295P2. The topicalised P1 also frequently displays syntactic or semantic
marking. And even when not syntactically marked as subject or object, P1
has agent or patient function within the predication. A P2 constituent is
placed in the beginning of the clause and is overtly marked. Its relation to
the rest of the sentence seems to be more than just “specifying the
universe of discourse.” For our purposes it is best to divide the Abau
sentence in TOPIC, COMMENT, TAIL. The topic part generally consists of
P1 and P2 constituents and the comment part consists of only nontopicalised constituents. A predication nearly always consists of a topic
part and a comment part, although it is possible that the predication only
contains a comment part if the topic part is understood. The tail is not an
obligatory part of the predication. It mostly hosts only one constituent
which may occur with or without topic marking.
The Abau sentence can be divided into three parts: TOPIC, COMMENT,
TAIL as illustrated by Table 51.","[307, 308, 309]"
"9Abau appears to be an extreme example of the tendency to
“thematisation” described by de Vries (2005: 368). He notes that in a
number of Papuan languages thematic constituents are “a juxtaposed
series of thematic constituents that have pragmatic relations of relevance
to the clauses that follow but are syntactically and intonationally separate
units.” This pattern occurs often in Abau. However, whereas in many
Papuan languages this pattern is associated with the beginning of a text
and the number of noun phrases per verb declines drastically once the
story is under way (de Vries 2005: 369), in Abau topic-marked noun
phrases remain frequent throughout entire texts.
In the typology of head-marking and dependent-marking languages
introduced by Nichols (1986), Abau is an extreme example of a
dependent-marking grammar.2 Examples of this tendency are:
a. The high proportion of nouns to verbs already described.
b. A complex system of dependent noun phrase markers which
follow almost every noun, and establish its pragmatic, syntactic
and semantic role.
c. The existence of both a gender system (marked on the noun
phrase markers), and a cross-cutting system of numeral classifiers,
used with the numerals one, two and three.
d. Verbs do not inflect for tense, aspect, mood or person. Verb stems
are affixed only for direction and manner of action. The
distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect is
indicated by clause-final particles in the case of non-indicative
clauses, and by intonation over the verb phrase for indicative
clauses.","[22, 23]"
"6.4.1 Verbal clause consisting only of VP and modal
marker
A verbal clause can consist of just a VP often accompanied by a modal
marker in order to make a meaningful expression. In (24), the verb phrase
is preceded by the prohibitive peie followed by a speech marker. In (25),
the verb phrase is preceded by the hortative marker kwa.

The VP in a verbal clause can be modified by an adverb that precedes

Incorporated nouns, i.e. nouns that work in close corporation with a
verb to establish one single meaning will precede the verb phrase without
any syntactic or other marking. In (28), the noun kar ‘happiness’ occurs
without any marking. Incorporated nouns always precede the verb phrase
unless a modal marker like kwa ‘HOR’ intervenes. (See also §3.11.1)

constituents
A verbal clause can be further extended by topicalised constituents
that do not display any syntactic or semantic case marking. It was noted in
§6.2 that verbless clauses consist of a topic and a comment part. The topic
part of the verbless clause is mostly filled by a topicalised noun phrase
and the comment part is often filled by a non-topicalised modifier. This
internal clause division of a topicalised part and a comment part can be
found in verbal clauses as well. The topicalised part is nearly always197expressed, but if it is not (like in §6.4.1 and §6.4.2) it is always
understood. When the topicalised part is expressed, the topicalised
constituent(s) will host the topic marker -kwe. In (29), the topic part of the
clause is filled by the topicalised NP yeyk ohokwe ‘this canoe’. The rest of
the clause is the comment part of the clause (see §8.4).

It needs to be noted that topicalised nominal personal pronouns can be
analysed as either topicalised subjects (marked both syntactically and
pragmatically) or as personal pronouns that are only pragmatically marked
for topic and not for subject. See discussion in §6.5.2.
The topic part of a clause can be filled by more than one NP. In (31), a
topicalised temporal phrase (pokon kokwe) and a topicalised subject
phrase (hakwe) form together the topic part of the sentence.

Semantic case marking is realised by postpositional phrases. A
postpositional locative noun phrase can occur in the topic part of a clause,
as in (32). The postpositional phrase yier serey mon kokwe is marked for198location by mon and for topic by kokwe. The NP hiykwe is marked for
topic and subject.

A postpositional noun phrase is not always topicalised. Postpositional
noun phrases like the Accompaniment NP and the Comparative NP (see
§3.9.5 and §3.9.6) are often not, since their semantic meaning makes them
more candidates for the comment part of the clause.
The Accompaniment NP (hano aio se nion) and the Comparative NP
(aio se hieyn) are not topicalised; therefore, they are part of the comment
in (33) and (34) respectively.

Abau has three object NP markers without demonstrative force (se, ke
and me), and six object NP markers which have it (the latter group is
discussed in §3.8.2). All object NP markers display a final -e which signals
object. They are all differentiated for gender and/or number. They mark
the NP as a referential item or identifiable participant.
In (90), the NP yeyk se is marked for object by the NP marker se. This
marker also marks the noun for masculine singular. The NP aio hiykwe is
marked for subject and topic by the NP marker hiykwe.

The topicalisation of object NPs is not straightforward. The
topicalisation of object pronouns (§3.1.3) is slightly different from the
topicalisation that occurs on object NP markers. NPs marked for object that
have a noun as head of the NP are topicalised by the feminine topic marker
kokwe regardless of gender and number.
In (93), the bolded NP Keno se kokwe is marked syntactically for
object and pragmatically for topic. The gender and number of the head
noun is marked by the singular masculine object marker se and not by the
NP final topic marker kokwe which has feminine gender. The topic marker
kokwe takes into its scope the noun with its object marking.

In (94), the NP Kupe se kokwe is both topicalised and marked for
object. This double marking is in this example required, since the normal
syntax order SOV is changed to OSV. (For more discussion see §6.5.1.)84(94) Enekwei sohokwe

In (95), the object kuey me ‘grubs PL-OBJ’ is topicalised by the topic
marker kokwe. Again, the head of the noun phrase is marked for number
by the object marker me and not by the feminine singular topic marker
kokwe.

are not accepted by all.

The use of sekwe and even sokwe as a contraction of se kokwe has
been especially observed in the central dialect. This usage is considered
incorrect by other dialects since the usage of sekwe and sokwe, is similar
or identical to the distal demonstrative object marker sokwe (§3.8.2).
When editing texts, even speakers of the central dialect tend to change
sekwe to se kokwe. Similar contractions of ke kokwe and me kokwe into
shorter forms have not been observed.","[95, 96, 97, 98]"

‘Why did you come? (Lit. In order to do what did you
come?)’
The analysis above is given with some hesitation. The interrogative is
presently pronounced as paneke, while there seems to be no reason why
the first syllable was reduced from pay to pa. In light of the lack of
convincing evidence, the interrogative paneke will be simply labeled
‘why’ in the interlinear examples.
The interrogatives payhokuaw and paneke can be interchanged in
most contexts. But some speakers make a distinction. If the above analysis
on the semantic origin of both terms is correct it suggests a distinction
between reason and (mental) goal. The former (payhokuaw) might be
used when motives and explanations are asked for, the latter (paneke)
when intentions and objectives are sought after. It has been noted that
rhetorical questions tend to be constructed with paneke, although not all
the time. This is probably not surprising since a rhetorical question
sometimes focuses on the goal and sometimes on the reason of a certain
issue. The three examples with payhokuaw above all seem to fit the
definition here, since they can all be viewed as questions regarding
background and source motive.
Example (146) illustrates a rhetorical question. It is probably arbitrary
whether the question zooms in on the reason (for what reason) or the goal
(to what end).

sentence topic and comment
Constituents within the sentence are marked or positioned in such a
way that the sentence can be easily divided in a topic part and a comment
part. Some sentences also have a third part: a phrase or clause in tail
position. The division between the topic and comment part is a prominent
feature of the language and plays an important role in the creation of
comprehensible and logical communication.
The focal point of this chapter is to shed light on the distinctions in
relative prominence of the various phrase constituents within a sentence.
It starts with a discussion on the concept of topic (§8.1) and the overall
structure of an Abau sentence (§8.2). This is followed by a presentation of
the structure and the internal ordering of the constituents within both the
topic part (§8.3) and the comment part (§8.4) of the sentence. A
discussion about the tail position (§8.5) is also included. The chapter
concludes with discussions how constituents within the sentence can be
given less or more prominence (§8.6), how participants are tracked (§8.7),
and lastly, what features distinguish the backgrounding, foregrounding
and climax within a discourse (§8.8).","[302, 303, 304, 305]"
"48b. Abstract and non-material nouns are nearly always
feminine
Non-material and abstract nouns like ok ‘talk’, aw ‘fight’, weyn
‘behaviour’, yayh ‘song’, mey ‘work’, oksa ‘sound’, hay ‘magic’,
nonkway ‘knowledge’ are all feminine. One exception observed is the
word prawk ‘smell, scent’ which is masculine. It is possible that smell is
considered material rather than non-material.
c. Objects regarded as two-dimensional are feminine
No object is of course truly two-dimensional, but thin objects like
leaves, tablets and coins are feminine. Insects, possibly on the basis that
they are regarded as two-dimensional, are also feminine nouns. The
contrast between two-dimensionality (feminine) and three-dimensionality
(masculine) is essential in gender determination. Two other features,
however, play a role in determining the gender of objects for which it is
hard to determine whether they should be classified as two-dimensional or
as three-dimensional. Objects with regular three-dimensional features tend
to be masculine, except if they have a very flat surface (see c1) or if the
roundness of the object (not in a 3- but only in a 2-dimensional way) is a
very salient feature (see c2).
c1. Objects with a flat surface which are not too voluminous
are feminine
An object that has a flat surface and not too voluminous is regarded as
feminine. In the Abau world view, all fish are regarded as having a flat
surface and are therefore feminine. The feature of a flat surface is also
dominant in nouns like howk ‘lake’ and iwa ‘swamp’, but not in yawp
‘river’. The latter is masculine, because here the feature of extendedness is
predominant. Body parts that have a flat surface and which are not too
voluminous are regarded feminine, e.g. iha ‘hand’, sune ‘foot’, nweyk
‘ear’. Most other body parts are considered three-dimensional and are
assigned masculine gender. This includes makwey ‘head’, kasaw ‘nose’,
nene ‘eye’, and uron ‘heart’.
c2. Objects which are round from a two-dimensional
perspective are feminine
When objects have two dimensional roundness as the predominant
feature, they are classed as feminine. The generic word for ‘snake’ sok is49masculine. Apparently, its extendedness is in focus. However, a particular
green garden snake wondeis is referenced with feminine pronominal
markers. This snake is often coiled up in the form of a circle and this
feature might be in focus here. Also included in this set of twodimensional roundness are the nouns hne ‘bird’s nest’ and kan ‘a vine
woven into a circle’. However, the loan word bal ‘ball’ is masculine,
because the roundness is here three-dimensional.
d. Objects regarded as three-dimensional are masculine
When the feature three-dimensionality is regarded as predominant the
noun is marked masculine. This depends on the perception of the speaker,
which may vary as is illustrated in examples (32) and (33). Truly threedimensional entities are certain fruits: su ‘coconut’ am ‘breadfruit’. As
long as the three-dimensional feature is predominant the entity can be
small, e.g. nene ‘eye’. This set also includes all liquids, e.g. hu ‘water’,
nioh ‘blood’, sueyr ‘rain’.
The distinction between two-dimensional or three-dimensional
depends on the perception of the speaker. The choice is sometimes
arbitrary, e.g. the word mein ‘stone’ occurs in a wide variety of forms and
sizes. When features like flatness and roundness are in focus the noun
mein is regarded as feminine. When, however, the features of threedimensionality or large size are in focus the noun mein is regarded as
masculine.
The word a ‘house’ is masculine, in spite of the fact that the object
has a number of flat surfaces. The predominant features which are in
focus are its large size and its three-dimensionality.
e. Animal categories are distinguished according to size
Larger animals tend to be masculine, smaller animals tend to be
feminine. Large animals, like mu ‘crocodile’, pareis ‘wallaby’, nwoh
‘dog’ are masculine. Animals that have as the salient feature
extendedness, like sok ‘snake’ , mnow ‘eel’ and kie ‘lizard’, are all
masculine.
Larger birds, like worim ‘flying fox’, wayp ‘eagle’, and mowr
‘hornbill’ are masculine, but a moderate-sized bird like sokua ‘cockatoo’
is regarded as feminine and so are all birds that are smaller than the
cockatoo.","[61, 62, 63]"
"1.10 Acknowledgements
This current grammar write-up is based on research conducted by me
over a period of more than 20 years under the auspices of the Papua New
Guinea Branch of SIL International. My wife and I learned to speak the
language, collected stories and studied the local culture. We were able to
involve a large number of Abau speakers in the establishment of the
current orthography and in the development of a three year curriculum in
the vernacular for the 25 Abau speaking villages along the Sepik River.
The vast majority of the examples in this grammar paper have been taken
from a corpus of non-elicited texts of 85,000 words.
We want to thank the Yabru community for allowing us to live among
them since September 1982. We especially thank our friends and fellowworkers Obow Inaru and Alex Nomben, who, along with many others,
have helped us to gain many valuable insights into the language.
A special word of thanks goes to our colleagues within SIL whose
encouragement and input have been essential in gaining insights in the15structure of the Abau language. I want to thank Bob Conrad not only for
his assistance in producing the Abau Grammar essentials in 1985
(unpublished manuscript) but also for his willingness to be one of the
editors in the final stages of the current document. Secondly, I want to
thank the late Cindi Farr for her enthusiasm and keen insights into how
information is marked for relative prominence within Abau texts. A major
part of this paper was finished under her supervision in 1999.
In 2007, I was encouraged to make the research available to the wider
public. SIL colleague Ian Tupper probed me with many questions about
the wording of certain sections that needed further work. He also kindly
gave me many suggestions and editorial comments for the other sections. I
believe they have improved the overall clarity of this grammar. Thanks
are also due to Lisa Halverson who did a fine job in preparing the
manuscript for publication, John Carter who produced two of the maps,
several people in Ukarumpa who did the final proofreading and René van
den Berg who oversaw the whole process as series editor.
Lastly, I want to thank my wife Maija for her encouragement and
support. The current grammar write-up does not reflect sufficiently the
many warm and meaningful friendships she helped to develop with our
Abau friends.","[28, 29]"

texts
If an Abau speaker’s communicative goal is to narrate or list a series
of events, he or she will encode these events in sentences using temporal
phrases, which chain the sentences in a coherent temporally ordered
pattern. Changes in spatial and temporal settings and participants are
significant elements in these discourses and may indicate new segments
within a discourse.
Of these last three elements, the change in temporal setting is the most
important indicator of a discourse break in narrative texts. NPs that may
mark a discourse section break are temporal NPs that are modified by the
numeral one e.g. enekwei kamon ‘a certain day’, wik kamon ‘a certain
week’ etc. Other temporal changes include predications that place the
story line in a different time setting with a temporal constituent that is not
dependent for its meaning on the rest of the discourse, e.g. a reference to a
date or to a known time period, like childhood, the days of the ancestors,
the day someone died, etc. In procedural texts the logical order rather than
the temporal order is in focus, although they might overlap.
Examples (10) and (11) are consecutive sentences in a story. The
temporal phrase enekwei kamon hokwe ‘a certain time’ starts a new
section within the discourse in (10). The next sentence (11) is part of the
same paragraph, since it contains two references or links to the first
sentence. Firstly, the temporal clause marked by menkin ‘when’ gives
further detail to the time phrase already mentioned in (10). Secondly, the
adverbial demonstrative sehe anaphorically refers to the previous sentence
and establishes a logical connection between this sentence (10) and the
main clause it occurs in.

‘So when it was morning he went out to do timber cutting (for
the) house.’
A number of devices can be used to mark time within a text. These
time indications help to structure the text into a logical sequence of
events. Subordinate clauses with clause-final markers can mark time, e.g.
nok ‘SEQ’, menkin ‘when’, ankin ‘as/while’ (§9.5). Internal markers
within the verb phrase also mark time, e.g. nayr ‘night’, kok ‘day time’
etc. (§4.3.3.3). Temporal NPs like enekwei sohokwe ‘(at) that time’ or
postpositional phrases (§3.9) are also used to mark or sequence time
within a discourse.
Examples (12) through (14) are part of the same text. All constituents
that mark time have been bolded. In (12), the marker nok ‘SEQ’ places the
events in the first clause in sequential order: The Yabru man (lit. riverman) spoke after they all ate. The temporal adverb kok ‘day time’ places
the given command in a time frame.

‘After they had eaten, the fierce Yabru man, said in parting to

refers to the command given in the previous sentence. It has therefore
cohesive function and helps to keep track of the sequential order of the
various events. The temporal adverb kok ‘daytime’ and the temporal NP
enekwei sohokwe ‘that day’, supply the events of the sentence they occur
in with a time setting.

Procedural texts are often concerned with sequence rather than time,
although the two overlap. The sequential marker nok, or postpositional
phrases that indicate sequence, e.g. meyki mon ‘after’ are used very
frequently. The adverbial verb phrase modifier pie ‘firstly’ also helps to393sequence events. These sequence indicators are demonstrated in (15) and
(16) which are taken from a procedural text.

Thematically organised discourses and texts include descriptions,
expositions, hortatory discourses and letters. Rather than centring around
the activities of participants, they centre around a global theme supported
by local topics. Examples are listed below, including the appropriate
section of the appendix: a descriptive text about a certain type snake

Pyu (pop. 100) – only one village community, known as Biak 2 (Biak
1 is an Abau speaking village); located near the Indonesian Border and
along the Biak River, a tributary of the Sepik River (Laycock 1973;
Conrad and Dye 1975). Laycock (1973) suggested that Pyu is related to
Kwomtari, but Baron (1983) found no evidence for this.
According to some sources (e.g. Laycock 1973; Lewis 2009), Yetfa
(Biksi) also has speakers on the Papua New Guinean side of the border,
west from the Abau language area. This was based on survey word lists
from Biak 2 village, where the primary language is Pyu. The women
surveyed had married into Biak 2 from a Yetfa-speaking village on the
Indonesian side of the border, as documented in articles on the language
by Laycock (1972), and Conrad & Dye (1975). 3 My own travels and
surveys did not lend any support to the claim that there are mother-tongue
Yetfa speakers in Papua New Guinea apart from those who have settled in
Biak 2 as a result of marriage exchange.
Namia, located east from Green River, belongs the Sepik language
family but is too far away to be considered a geographic neighbour. The
same is true for the Suganga (West-Miamin), located in the south, since
none of their village communities is found close to any Abau speaking
communities.","[24, 25]"

for evaluative comments once the description of the procedure is finished.

Descriptive texts are similar to procedural texts in that they are
informative and non-emotive. Procedural and descriptive texts both make
extensive use of the imperfective, since these texts often prescribe or
describe general or habitual behaviour. This is in contrast with narrative
texts which make extensive use of the perfective to describe unique events
that in their totality took place in the past.
Whereas procedural texts are concerned with the correct manner to
perform a task, descriptive texts are concerned with the description of
observed behaviour or characteristics. Descriptive texts centre around a
global theme that is often a directly observable entity (e.g. animal, place,
custom, activity).
Descriptive texts make frequent use of verbless clauses: a topicalised
entity is supplied with a comment that either gives additional information
to that entity or supplies the entity with a certain identity. In (51), the first
topic NP is further defined for attributive characteristics, the second topic
NP is further identified for role.

Descriptive texts tend to have very few non-topicalised NPs that are
syntactically marked for subject or object. This in contrast to narrative
texts where non-topicalised NPs occur frequently. In (53-60), there is no
occurrence of a non-topicalised subject and only one example of a nontopicalised object.
Descriptive texts are also characterised by a high number of verbless
clauses or clauses formed with the stative verb lwak like e.g. (53) and411(54). The two topicalised NPs marked by mokwe occur in clauses that are
formed with the stative verb lwak. (Below in (53-60), all topic markers are
bolded.)

Non-topicalised NPs with syntactic marking are relatively rare in
descriptive texts. That is especially true for non-topicalised NPs marked
for subject and to a lesser extent for non-topicalised NPs marked for
object. The NP iwar me ‘people, human beings’ in (52) is an example of
such an occurrence.
The bolded NPs in (55) and (56) are respectively marked for object
and subject, but are topicalised as well.

Participants and props that are referred to in a descriptive text often do
not represent an individual, unique entity. This in contrast to narrative
texts, where participants and props have their own identity and often play
roles in specific, unique events. Many of the entities referred to in a
descriptive text are not uniquely identifiable entities, but often function as
representatives for their type or category. The marking on the NPs reflects
this. In (57), hmo pion mokwe ‘their meat’ has patient role, but it is not412marked for object. It is only marked by the general topic marker mokwe.
This is in line with the fact that the NP does not represent a single
identifiable entity, but represents the meat of all other wondeis-snakes as
well.

Descriptive texts can contain instructive sections that look very
similar to sections of a procedural text, e.g. the text “The snake” (§11.4)
moves from descriptive to instructive in the second part of the text. When
a descriptive text becomes instructive, an addressee is needed. Below, the413addressee is referred to by hwon ‘2S.SUB’ which functions as a universal
‘you’ taking into its scope all who hear or read this text.
In (61-63), possible scenarios are given in subordinate clauses marked
by ankin ‘if’ which are followed by a main clause expressing a command.
In (61), the command is marked by the prohibitive marker pese, and in
(63), the command is marked by the hortative marker kwa.

Hortatory discourse resembles expository discourse in that they are
both organised thematically and contain sentences that do not encode
events and are not ordered iconically. Both types of discourse want to414inform, defend a particular course of action, or express the speaker’s
viewpoint. The focus of an expository discourse is directed towards
building a sound argument, while the focus of a hortatory discourse is to
modify the addressee’s thinking or behaviour. Therefore, one will find
that a hortatory discourse is often punctuated at various intervals by valuejudgements, commands or suggestions using hortative forms and
assertions. An expository text deals with arguments and counter
arguments and the author can give a conclusion with or without
exhortation. For example, in the text on problems in childless marriages
(§11.5), the author only states his disapproval of men sending their wives
away in the final paragraph, after he has delineated arguments in favour
and against this behaviour.
Expository discourse deals with reasons, goals, contrasts,
comparisons, conditions linked to consequences, etc. The expression of
complicated ideas leads to the use of complex sentences with subordinate
clauses. An individual clause might be complex as well when e.g. a noun
is modified by embedded phrases or clauses, or when a subordinate clause
is placed in tail position when the speaker fears that the sentence might
not be fully understood.
In (64), the sentence contains a NP modified by a relative clause. It
also has an object clause in tail position. The modified NP is embedded at
two levels. The head of the NP uwr ‘man’ is marked for number by the
phrase final plural demonstrative somokwe. The NP head uwr is modified
by an embedded NP of which the head is sa ‘woman’. This head is
modified by the embedded relative clause ney lopa ma lwak. The
demonstrative seme that precedes the verb phrase establishes a logical
relationship between this clause and the previous one. The object clause in
tail position gives more detail to the idea expressed in the main clause.

‘As a result the men whose wives do not have children are
coming up with different ideas to send their wives away.’
Apart from the fact that the hortatory and the expository text differ in
focus, the discourse types have many similar features. Cohesive
connectives like seyr and sawk (§9.1) which are relatively rare in
descriptive and procedural texts often link or contrast arguments that
support the speaker’s main contentions. Conjunctions encoding reason
(payhokuaw §9.3.3), condition/circumstances (ankin §9.5.3), or logical
consequence (sehe, sokwe, seme §4.4.3) are used often.
In (65), the speaker makes use of reason and conditonal conjunctions
and links his argment to (66) by means of the contrastive connective sawk.
The speaker contrasts the group of men with children and the group of
men without children. All the conjunctions and cohesive markers in (6568) are bolded.

‘But those without children experience hardships, when they
have become old men.’
Subordinate clauses normally precede the main clause, but in (66) the
temporal clause is placed in tail position. As stated before, the tail position
is not used for new information. The speaker simply wants to avoid
ambiguity and adds the subordinate clause to make explicit what could
have been understood from the context already.
Quotes are introduced by the adverbial manner demonstrative senkin
(§4.4.2). The two consecutive arguments in (67-68) are linked by the
cohesive marker seyr ‘and, also’. The marker seyr links entities that are
similar to each other (§9.1.3). In this case it links two quotes that argue in
favour of the same point.

‘Paul’s letter states as follows, “In the present time the

A hortatory text is marked by frequent exhortations. The examples
below are taken from a speech by the local government member exhorting
the people to show up for the village work party the next Monday (§11.6).
The arguments used are a combination of veiled threats and appeals to
parental concern for the well-being of their children. The speaker portrays
himself both as the village leader they need to obey and as the concerned
father figure who looks after everyone’s well-being.
His discourse expresses three times a general command to look well
after the Aid Post. This can be done by an adhortative command (§7.1)
with the clause-final goal marker e as is done in (69).

questions that underline his arguments. Example (70) is a question which,
though answered, is rhetorical in nature. It emphasises the fact that no
alternatives for medical help are available. In (71), the speaker emphasises
this point by listing the potential difficulties the people are likely to
encounter if no action is taken.

It is very rare that the main point of a public hortatory speech is made
in the opening lines and then followed by supporting evidence. A speaker
prefers to pave the way for his main point by mentioning supporting419reasons and arguments first. He anticipates potential resistance to his
opinion or proposal and tries to answer these objections before he comes
to his main point.
The local parliament member in his speech about the Aid Post had as
goal to make the village people show up for community work on Monday.
This point is only made towards the end of the speech (73), after the
benefits of having the Aid Post have been mentioned and negative
scenarios of the village without an Aid Post have been stressed. Even
then, the speaker stays away from a direct command, but rather describes
what should happen when he asks the people to work on the Aid Post.

‘The story of the two brothers.’6.3Stative and existential verb lwak ‘to be’6.3.1 Stative verb relating comment to topic
The stative verb lwak ‘to be’ can be placed after comment constituents
with minimal semantic difference. Its presence basically changes an
utterance stated in absolute terms (13) into an utterance that is placed into
a time frame (14). (The verb lwak is marked for imperfective.)
(13) Wawp

wawp

(14) Wawp

wawp
mo-kwe
weyspey lwak
bird.sp GL.PL-TOP white
be. IPFTV
‘As for wawp birds, they are being white.’ (A present truth
that may or may not change.)
The presence of the existential verb lwak in (14) gives the comment a
time reference. Comrie (1976: 103-106) describes the difference in terms
of the distinction between contingent state and absolute state. In (14), the
existential verb lwak marks the whiteness of the birds as contingent. This
fact can potentially change whereas the absence of the stative verb lwak in193(13) gives the utterance an absolute timeless truth value. Compare also
(10) and (17) where (10), without lwak, states a timeless truth or state of
affairs. There is no indication that the state described was ever different.
Example (17) places the predicate in a time frame which suggests
uncertainty whether this state was different in the past or will be different
in the future.
Existential clauses encode temporary, contingent conditions. The
topic constituent is by definition topicalised. The verb lwak ‘to be’ relates
the comment to the topic in terms of characteristics.

Existential clauses having the verb lwak can occur with a topic marker
and be either marked or unmarked for subject. In (18), the topic
constituent is marked with the NP subject marker hom ‘2/3pl’ which is
suffixed with the topic marker -kwe. The verb lwak can be marked for the
imperfective (18) or perfective (19).

If lwak ‘to be’ relates the topic to the comment in terms of
characteristics, it can be deleted. See (13) and (14). If lwak ‘to be’ relates
the topic to the comment in terms of time or location, it cannot be deleted.
In (20), the verb lwak functions not as a stative verb that relates the topic
with characteristics, but as an intransitive verb that relates the topic with
location. The verb lwak relates the comment (the locative NP) to the topic
(a participant within the story). The motion verb lanio ‘walk’ in (21)
fulfils a similar function in regard to location.

The verb lwak ‘to be’ has the existential meaning ‘to live’ in contexts
that refer to time and location. This was already shown in (20) where a
topicalised participant was related to a comment that expressed location. It
is also possible to topicalise the location or temporal and relate this
constituent to a comment that signals the participant. If this is done, the
modifier senkin ‘DDEM-MAN’ is obligatorily present preceding lwak.
In (23) and (22) the topic constituents relate respectively to location
and time. In order to relate these topic constituents to a comment195constituent that signals an animate participant, the manner demonstrative
senkin needs to precede lwak.

the most nuclear part of the clause: the verb phrase. More phrase
constituents will be added to the verb phrase in the following sections,
starting with non-topicalised constituents that have no syntactic or
semantic case marking, working towards a fully developed verbal clause
that has constituents that display all variations of topic, syntactic and
semantic markings. In the examples below all the verb phrases are
underlined for easy recognition.","[205, 206, 207, 208, 209]"

The main point of hortatory and expository texts, and also letters, is
normally not revealed in the introduction, and not even early in the body
of the text. The main point of these three text types is often subjective and
might be controversial. The speaker tries to anticipate and overcome
potential resistance with introductory observations and statements. Only
after stating these presuppositions will the speaker make his main point.
(Examples are given in the sections dealing with hortatory and expository
texts, and letters.)
This is not the case with procedural and descriptive texts, since their
contents are mostly non-controversial and neutral. The theme of the text is
therefore often mentioned in the introduction. The topic of procedural
texts and descriptive texts can often be contained in a noun phrase or short
clause. See (3) and (5).
Example (5) is taken from a descriptive text (§11.4) which was
produced as a written text. The author gave it a title consisting of one nontopicalised NP that immediately relays the theme of the descriptive text.
The title is sufficient introduction, so the description of the topic starts
immediately in the next sentence. This is realised by a clause formed with
the stative verb lwak ‘be’.

The introduction to the content in time-iconic ordered texts often
takes the form of
a. a temporal (nearly always) or spatial setting, or
b. an introduction of the principal participants.
Example (6) is taken from a non-fiction narrative which was produced
as a written text. The time setting and the participants are introduced as
background information and are therefore topicalised. The first line
functions as an introduction to the story, but it also starts the story line.
The second sentence moves the story line further along, which is
exemplified by the fact that there is only one short topicalised constituent
in the topic part of the clause versus various constituents in the long
comment part of the sentence.

is framed with the stative verb lwak which is an indicator of background
information. Two topicalised NPs give the setting for the comment that is
expressed by the comment part of the first sentence. It is important to note
that in the second sentence the participant ohi-weys prueyn ‘a white
person’ is not introduced as background information. The second sentence
has no topicalised constituents and the newly introduced participant is
marked for subject. This is a clear indication that the story line has
changed from background to foreground and that this sentence points
towards a climactic event within the story line.

An introduction to the contents of a thematically oriented text is
usually done in the very beginning of the text with a clearly stated
reference to the global theme. In (8) and (9), the author introduces the
theme for the whole discourse in the opening sentence and then continues
to give details related to this theme.","[399, 400, 401, 402]"

‘But the hook of his friend Peni caught a big crayfish. And
consequently Jon now tried - unsuccessfully - to pull it in very

The cohesion marker sa indicates sequential cohesion between two
events. It encodes temporal succession. The sequencing sa expresses is
not related to contrast or change in focus or direction, but to the iconic
order of the events in the real world.
When sa occurs after a NP, it takes this NP into its scope and
highlights its importance as participant in the subsequent action. In (5),
the connective sa is placed after the NP homkwe ‘2/3PL.TOP’. The
connective takes this NP into its scope and marks its importance as a347participant in the event following. The connective itself sequences the two
events mentioned in the two sentences.

When sa occurs clause or sentence-initially, it encodes temporal

marks the event in the clause it is part of as subsequent to the event
mentioned in the previous clause.

‘(Context: Jon had already secretly gone to Kenu’s garden)
Kenu himself had also left for the garden. Then Jon tried unsuccessfully - to take away bananas. So then Kenu himself
came and saw the thief.’
It is worthwhile to compare the sequential cohesion marker sa with
the clause-final sequential marker nok (§9.5.4). Whereas the cohesion348marker sa can be used when there is a change of subject, the sequential
conjunction marker nok can only be used to describe a series of events
when there is no change of subject. The sequential marker sa is used in
two different clauses in (6) and both clauses host a subject that is different
from the previous clause. The sequential marker nok is used once to
connect two clauses which both have the same subject, though the subject
is only expressed in the first clause.
Example (7) illustrates the same point. The conjunction marker nok
connects two clauses with the same subject. The sequential cohesion
marker sa starts a clause which has a different subject than the preceding
clause.

Like sawk and sa, the cohesion marker seyr occurs clause-initially or
following a NP. It expresses added or extended information, and can often
be translated in English by ‘also’ or ‘as well’. The added information is
not time oriented. It supplies more information about an already
introduced participant. This information will never contradict what was
already known.
In (8), a town is described as having a large number of people. The
description of the town is extended. The cohesion marker seyr is followed
by the comment ki ko yeyk mokwe kraiar ‘a large number of cars’. This
does not contradict the information already given about the town, but is in
harmony with it.","[359, 360, 361, 362]"
