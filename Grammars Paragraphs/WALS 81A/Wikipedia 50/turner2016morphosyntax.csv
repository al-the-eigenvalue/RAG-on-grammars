"154Theoretical Analyses: Verb ExtensionsLike most contemporary syntactic theories, Dynamic Syntax is lexicalist – language
variation resides in the lexicon – and (8.7) shows an example of this. The lexical
actions in (8.6) reﬂect the fact that Katcha is a full pro-drop language by decorating
the argument nodes with metavariables, represented as U and V. Metavariables are
objects which act as placeholders for contentful Formula values. They do not constitute
expressions in the epsilon/lambda calculi and so must be replaced by such an expression,
this is marked formally by the requirement ?∃x.F o(x). In this way, they satisfy a type
requirement but replace it with a formula requirement. The formula requirement does
not have to be fulﬁlled through a linguistic source. One way it may be done is through
Substitution, a pragmatic process in which a suitable referent is chosen from context.
Thus (8.8) is a grammatical sentence. (In non-pro-drop languages the argument nodes
are decorated merely with a type requirement (?T y(e)), meaning that Substitution
is not a possibility and some lexical item is needed to provide the node with a value.)

After constructing and decorating the propositional template, the lexical actions of
the verb leave the pointer on the external argument node as in (8.7).3 The metavariable
on this node can be resolved by indentifying the unﬁxed node and the external argument
node. This is done by the computational action of Unification, which allows two typeidentical nodes with compatible addresses and content to be brought together. The
unﬁxed node has a deﬁned formula value but an underspeciﬁed tree node address, while
the external argument node has a deﬁned position in the tree but an underspeciﬁed
formula value. Both are type e, so they may be Unified (8.9).

"1.3. Theoretical Analyses7Chapter 8 presents a Dynamic Syntax analysis of valency-reducing verb extensions.
The diﬀerence between a transitive verb with object pro-drop on the one hand, and an
antipassive verb on the other, is that the transitive verb projects an object metavariable
allowing a referential argument whereas the antipassive saturates its object node with
a context-dependent epsilon term. Such a term picks out an arbitrary witness of some
predicate deﬁned as being dependent on the immediate context. The epsilon term
is thus a semantic object of minimal content, whose reference is both arbitrary and
entirely context-dependent. Heavily context-dependent objects of this kind allow a
straightforward analysis of reduced valency constructions such as ‘Drums are beaten
(by some arbitrary agent of drum beating)’.
Chapter 9 outlines a Dynamic Syntax approach to prepositional phrases which
construes them as adjuncts, constructing LINKed structure from whichever node of
the main propositional tree they modify. The analysis is developed by applying it not
only to prepositional phrases, but also to other relevant constructions in the Katcha
data. Prepositional phrases which have an intersective interpretation modify a term,
either an individual or an event. They are construed as building a LINKed propositional
tree that provides extra information about some argument in the matrix proposition.
As such they are similar to relative clauses, and use the same technical apparatus as
standard DS treatments of relatives. The formal details of the process are reﬁned
slightly in order to extend the analysis to handle the recursive locative prepositional
phrases common in Katcha. This reﬁnement makes use only of DS tools that have
been proposed independently for other constructions in other languages. Prepositional
phrases which have a subsective interpretation modify predicates. They are construed
as building a LINKed tree providing extra information about some predicate in the
matrix proposition. The analysis is then extended to locative adverbs, construing
them as modifying a predicate projected by the locative preposition, thus bringing
together the analyses of the two types of modiﬁcation. Lastly, the analysis is applied
to applicatives, arguing that these may be treated much like prepositions, the only real
diﬀerence being that the applicative morpheme does not form a syntactic constituent
with its complement. The chapter ﬁnishes by discussing the notion of case in the light
of the analysis presented for prepositional phrases and it is suggested that this may
shed light on indirect and applied objects, topicalised subjects and the form of personal
pronouns in Katcha.
Chapter 10 provides a Dynamic Syntax analysis of nominal modiﬁers, following
on from the arguments advanced in chapter 5 that nominal modiﬁers are appositional
demonstrative pronouns, or are phrases headed by them. The implementation begins
with an analysis of Katcha nouns, noting that lexical nouns cannot be modiﬁed internally and so must project a fully speciﬁed epsilon structure, and a discussion of the
process of LINK Apposition and its evaluation which are used to allow modiﬁcation.","[25, 26]"
"Chapter 9Adjuncts, Prepositions and Case
Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to outline a Dynamic Syntax approach to prepositional
phrases. To date, the only serious attempt at analysing prepositional phrases within
Dynamic Syntax is that of Marten (2002), who treats them as optional arguments of
the main predicate. This chapter proposes an alternative which construes prepositional
phrases as adjuncts, an approach which more closely reﬂects the observations of Lakoﬀ
and Ross (1976) that most prepositional phrases are adverbial and situated outside the
verb phrase. A prepositional phrase constructs semantic structure which is separate
from the main propositional tree but connected to the node it modiﬁes by means of
a LINK relation. The analysis is developed by applying it not only to prepositional
phrases, but also to other relevant constructions in the Katcha data.
Section 9.1 demonstrates how this approach applies to prepositional phrases which
have an intersective, or adjectival, interpretation. These are prepositional phrases which
modify a term. This term may be an individual but is more commonly an event (again,
this is in line with the observations of Lakoﬀ and Ross (1976)). The prepositional
phrases are construed as building a LINKed propositional tree that provides extra
information about some argument in the matrix proposition. As such they are similar
to relative clauses, and use the same technical apparatus as standard DS treatments
of relatives. The formal details of the process are reﬁned slightly in section 9.2 in
order to handle the recursive locative prepositional phrases described in section 6.4.
This reﬁnement makes use only of DS tools that have been proposed independently for
other constructions in other languages.
Given that the approach adopted here is to treat prepositional phrases as adjuncts, it
should apply equally as well to adverbs. This is taken up in section 9.3, with a discussion
of prepositional phrases which modify predicates and which therefore have a subsective,
or adverbial, interpretation. They are construed as building a LINKed tree providing181182Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Caseextra information about some predicate in the matrix proposition. Section 9.4 then
extends this to locative adverbs. These words have been described by some authors as
postpositions, but it was argued in section 6.4 that they are in fact adverbs. Locative
adverbs are easily dealt with under an analysis that construes them as modifying a
predicate projected by the locative preposition, thus bringing together the analyses of
the two types of modiﬁcation.
The ﬁnal two sections of the chapter apply the analysis to two constructions related
to prepositional phrases. Section 9.5 discusses applicatives, arguing that these may
be treated much like prepositions, the only real diﬀerence being that the applicative
morpheme does not form a syntactic constituent with its complement. Section 9.6 then
goes on to look at case. The DS construal of case as a ﬁlter on well-formed structure is
discussed with respect to the analysis of prepositional phrases developed here and it is
suggested that this may shed light on indirect and applied objects, topicalised subjects
and the form of personal pronouns in Katcha.","[198, 199, 200, 201]"
"1.4 Overall aims
This study is very much data-led. It does not set out with a speciﬁc hypothesis to be
tested (other than the very general hypothesis that Dynamic Syntax may be a suitable
framework for the analysis of phenomena found in Nilo-Saharan languages). Rather,
the goal has been to investigate the Katcha language with an open mind, ﬁnd out what
is interesting about it and then try to provide a Dynamic Syntax analysis for that.
The order in which the study is presented, with the morphosyntactic descriptions
in part II separate from the theoretical analyses in part III, reﬂects this process.
It also serves to make the study more accessible. In order to be of beneﬁt to the
widest possible range of readership, I have endeavoured to keep the descriptive analysis
as general and atheoretical as possible. It is hoped that those whose interest is in
questions of typology, the description of Nuba languages or the genetic aﬃliation of
Kadu, but who do not have a background in Dynamic Syntax or formal semantics,
may ﬁnd at least the ﬁrst two-thirds of the thesis to be of use and of interest. It is
hoped that the new data presented here will add to our knowledge and understanding
of Nuba Mountain languages. Furthermore, in describing and analysing some of the
typologically unsual features of Katcha’s nominal system, this thesis aims to challenge
some standard assumptions about these constructions and contribute to the debate
about the language’s genetic aﬃliation.
Of course, data is not described in a vacuum; the general theoretical assumptions
held by the researcher — any researcher — frame the questions he or she asks and
inﬂuence the descriptive analysis. Although I aim to present the morphosyntactic
descriptions in a relatively atheoretical way, the general assumptions underlying these
descriptions are those of Dynamic Syntax, taking incrementality and dynamic processes
seriously. It is to be hoped that adopting such assumptions will yield insights in the
morphosyntactic descriptions that might otherwise be missed.
The main aim of the theoretical analyses in part III is to test the suitability of1.4. Overall aims9Dynamic Syntax to model some of the key insights of the descriptive analysis, while
also extending and reﬁning the theory where necessary. In testing DS as a model,
the main criterion must be the extent to which the theoretical tools provided by DS
are suﬃcient to model the Katcha data. Where it is necessary to make adjustments
to those tools, the aim is to improve the theory and make it better suited to real-life
language.
The typological and theoretical ﬁndings which result from the application of a
theoretical framework to new language data naturally have implications for a wider
theory of language. Some brief comments on these are made at the end of the study in
chapter 11.","[27, 28]"
"158Theoretical Analyses: Verb ExtensionsTaking these assumptions into account, the antipassive suﬃx can be construed as
decorating the internal argument node with some contextually dependent epsilon term.
In the case of sentence (8.16), this will be the term given in (8.17), leading to the logical
form shown in (8.18):6
(8.17) ϵx , Laugh.at′ (x)(Kuku′ )(si )
(8.18)F o(Laugh.at′ (a)(Kuku′ )(si )), T y(t), ♢F o(si ), T y(es )F o(Laugh.at′ (a)(Kuku′ )),
T y(es → t)F o(Kuku′ ), T y(e)F o(Laugh.at′ (a)),
T y(e → (es → t))
F o(a),
T y(e)F o(Laugh.at′ ),
T y(e → (e → (es → t)))where a = ϵx , Laugh.at′ (x)(Kuku′ )(si )
As noted in section 8.1, an epsilon term ϵx , F (x) represents some arbitrary individual,
x, of which the property F holds. The epsilon term in (8.17), which forms the internal
argument of the proposition at the root node of (8.18) represents the object of Kuku’s
laughing: some arbitrary x such that, in situation si , Kuku′ laughs at x, in other words
‘whatever it is Kuku is laughing at in this instance’. Importantly (given the semantics
of the antipassive discussed in section 7.2.1), this term is completely dependent on the
immediate context of the tree in which it occurs, drawing its content from the formula
values of the other terminal nodes in the tree.
The lexical actions associated with the antipassive suﬃx (8.19) achieve this context
dependence by copying formula values from elsewhere in the partial tree. This lexical
entry states that the pointer must be at the logical subject node (that is, a type e node
whose mother is of type es → t) and that there must be some formula σ of type es
decorating the situation argument node and some formula ϕ of type e → (e → (es → t))
decorating the predicate node. If these conditions are met, the pointer moves to the
logical object node and decorates it with an epsilon term which incorporates the formula
value of the predicate (ϕ) as its restrictor and the values of the situation argument (σ)
and logical subject (α) as arguments:
6In order to declutter the tree diagrams, I suppress the λ-operators and their bound variables
when representing predicate formulae. Thus in (8.18) the formula Laugh.at′ should be taken as an
abbreviation for λx.λy.Laugh.at′ (x)(y). Functors always appear to the right of their arguments in the
tree, and semantic types are stated explicitly on each node, so this should not lead to any ambiguity.","[176, 177]"
"Neither areunambiguous. To give an example, the noun phrase kadu nyeꞌdꞌde... in (7.20) appearsto be a potential candidate for the agent of kussudene. The sentence would thenmean ‘God’s wisdom is known by all who accept God’s words’. However, we cannot
discount the possibility that this noun phrase plays a more oblique semantic role, such
as cause. That is, ‘God’s wisdom is known because of those who accept his words’,
with the knower(s) being an implied third party. Indeed, if the English translation and
the Katcha translation accurately paraphrase the same proposition, the latter is the
favoured reading.

‘God’s wisdom is shown to be true by all who accept it.’(LUKE 7:35)It seems then that the agent of a passive construction is made explicit very rarely, if at
all. If the agent of an event is important enough to the discourse to be made explicit,
the passive suﬃx is unlikely to be used. An analysis of discourse structure lies outwith
the scope of this study, but given that syntactic subjects can occur after the verb as
well as before, it is perhaps a plausible speculation that word order, rather than verbal
morphology, is the device used to signal the relative prominence of verbal arguments.
3
There are in fact 202 instances of words carrying the -tene passive suﬃx, but a number of these
are derived nominal forms, such as katalaadene, ‘disciples’ (from laala, ‘teach’, thus ‘people who are
taught’)7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes1357.2.3 Unaccusative (‘Impersonal Passive’)
Although the agent of a verb marked with Passive -tené is seldom stated explicitly, it
appears that its existence is nevertheless always implied. This contrasts with the other
passive-like suﬃx -nca, which is described by Stevenson as ‘Stative or Neuter-Passive’
(Stevenson 1956-57:57). It has no obvious agent and in this sense can be thought of as
an ‘impersonal’ type of passive. Perhaps the most useful term to use to describe this
form is ‘Unaccusative’.
Unaccusatives are deﬁned by Perlmutter, within the framework of Relational Grammar, as containing ‘a 2-arc but no 1-arc’ (Perlmutter 1978:160). That is to say, they
have an underlying direct object (usually the semantic Patient) which is ‘advanced’ to
the position of subject but, unlike passives, have no Agent argument to be ‘demoted’
to an oblique position. Expressing this in more theory-neutral terms, an Unaccusative
verb can be deﬁned as one whose syntactic subject is its Patient/Theme argument and
which has no Agent argument. This is exactly the situation which occurs with the
Katcha -nca suﬃx and so ‘Unaccusative’ would seem to be an appropriate name for
this suﬃx.
The contrast in meaning between Passive and Unaccusative forms can be seen in
(7.21-7.23). Stevenson (1941:113-114) suggests that ‘the general implication’ of a verb
marked with -nca ‘is ﬁnality, or state.’ Clearly, this does not mean that a verb marked
with -nca must carry a stative/generic meaning: whilst this does appear to be the case
for (7.23), examples (7.21-7.22) both refer to single events. Rather, it is a question of
how the event is viewed. In the passive (7.21a/b, 7.22a) the focus is on the event itself,
which is seen as an action and therefore has an implied agent. In the unaccusative
(7.21c, 7.22b) the focus is on the result of the event, which is seen as a process and
therefore has no implied agent. In both the passive and the unaccusative, the syntactic
subject is the semantic undergoer (i.e. the patient) of the event described by the verb.

‘the drum is being hit for wrestling’ (currently)
b. ambá m-abʊ-n akâtabeːnédrum 3f-hit-unacc loc wrestling
‘the drum is hit for wrestling’ (habitually)
The Unaccusative is frequently followed by a locative adverb5 , such as kʊ́ɓʊ́, ‘down’
in (7.21c) and (7.22b). This does not appear to be obligatory, and never appears when
there is some other complement of the verb (as in (7.23b)). However, where there is no
complement, it seems to be strongly preferred.
There is a connection between the Unaccusative and the Antipassive, which manifests in two ways. The ﬁrst is morphological. Stevenson states that the Unaccusative
suﬃx is ‘by preference attached to intransitive verbs’ (Stevenson 1941:114). An example
of this is shown in (7.22b). According to my data, the preference is not quite as strong
as Stevenson’s statement suggests; indeed, his own data includes as many verbs with-nca attached to a transitive stem as to an intransitive one. Stevenson’s examples of
verbs where -nca attaches to an Antipassive suﬃx largely concur with mine, suggesting
that this is perhaps a lexical preference. Nonetheless, there appear to be a reasonable
number of these, so it seems fair to say that there is at least some correlation between
these two forms of the verb.
The second way in which Unaccusative and Antipassive are connected is a semantic
one, seen in (7.23b). Like the Antipassive (see example 7.16), the Unaccusative can
be used to describe events with a general scope or of a habitual nature. Thus while
(7.23a) describes a present event, (7.23b) describes a habitual situation.

"11.3.1 Taking a dynamic approach
In any scientiﬁc enterprise, theory and data should be in a symbiotic relationship: the
theory should explain and make sense of the data, but the data should lead and shape
the theory. In research like that presented in the present study, whose main aim is the
application of a particular theoretical framework to novel data, the continual interaction
between theory and data must be a guiding principle.
The way in which the data acts to shape the theory is relatively obvious. Chapters
8–10 provide Dynamic Syntax analyses of various morphosyntactic phenomena found11.3. Concluding comments257in Katcha nominals. Some of these analyses are straightforward implementations of
Dynamic Syntax as it has previously been used in the analysis of various languages,
but others involve adjusting or extending the framework. Such extensions have been
noted in the course of presenting the analyses. A clear example is the discussion in
section 10.2, which extends the analysis of demonstrative pronouns from the projection
of a simple metavariable to a more complex set of actions projecting a partial epsilon
term including a nominal variable and epsilon binder in addition to the metavariable.
It was noted in that section that this construal of demonstrative pronouns entails a
reformulation of the notion of substitution, and that this may be a challenge to the
Dynamic Syntax formalism.
The way in which the theory acts on the data may be less blatant, but it is
important to make it as explicit as possible. From an epistemological point of view,
it is not possible to look at data in a completely objective, non-theoretical manner.
The very act of using metalinguistic notions such as ‘noun’ to describe some element
of the language being studied implies theoretical assumptions at some level. Indeed,
it would be impossible to discuss the data at all without engaging in such theoretical
abstraction. The whole point of theory is to provide a systematic framework for these
assumptions, allowing the researcher to explain and make sense of the data. As such,
I have tried throughout this thesis to maintain an awareness of how the descriptive
analyses presented may have been inﬂuenced by the theoretical approach adopted.
Maintaining a balance between data and theory has been a key objective throughout.
This objective may have been concealed somewhat by the order of presentation,
which purports to separate out the descriptions of the data in part II from the theoretical analyses in part III. This somewhat artiﬁcial separation was made for two reasons.
The ﬁrst is a practical one. In order to make the study accessible and of beneﬁt to
the widest possible range of readership, I have endeavoured to keep the descriptive
analysis as general and atheoretical as possible. It is hoped that those whose interest
is in questions of typology, the description of Nuba languages or the genetic aﬃliation
of Kadu, but who do not have a background in Dynamic Syntax or formal semantics,
may ﬁnd at least the ﬁrst two-thirds of the thesis to be of use and of interest.
The second reason for separating the presentation of the data from the theory is
that it reﬂects the fact that this research has been data-led. As noted at the beginning
of this chapter, the goal of this research project was not to test a speciﬁc hypothesis, but
to investigate the Katcha language with an open mind, ﬁnd out what was interesting
about it and then try to provide a Dynamic Syntax anlaysis for that. In this way,
separating the presentation of the descriptive analyses and theoretical analyses in this
study reﬂects the nature of the process as a whole.
The descriptive analyses in chapters 4–7 are thus presented with little or no explicit
reference to Dynamic Syntax.","[275, 276]"

fenceThere are two comments to make concerning these nouns. The ﬁrst is that both sand aɲ- are rare morphemes. Neither occur with any nouns other than those given in(4.10). Most notably, there are no (non-replacive) singulative nouns which take s- as
the singulative preﬁx, and no (non-replacive) plurative nouns which take aɲ- as theirplurative preﬁx. As discussed below, this is unusual.
Secondly, it would seem likely the s- and aɲ- preﬁxes are indeed in the process ofdisappearing from the language. Besides Stevenson’s comment that plural aɲ- is being
replaced by nV-, (4.10c) may be an indication that singulative s- is also disappearingand being replaced by ns-. Of course, this is speculation based on only one lexical item,
but it is certainly plausible.
Replacive marking using existing plurative/singulative preﬁxes
In the vast majority of cases, Katcha nouns with replacive number-marking use some
combination of the plurative and singulative aﬃxes seen in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. The
list in (4.11) gives some examples of replacive nouns. (This list is ordered by plurative
preﬁx.)46Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Number and Gender(4.11)

"9.5 Applicatives
Prototypical applicatives are valency increasing devices, which potentially constitutes
a challenge to Dynamic Syntax. DS takes a strictly monotonic incremental approach to
parsing. If the verb root and the applicative suﬃx are separate parsable morphemes,
they must be processed in linear order. This would entail parsing the verb root ﬁrst,
following the associated lexical actions and building a propositional structure with
either one or two argument nodes (for intransitive and transitive verbs respectively).
The question of how the applicative morpheme could then add an additional argument
node is non-trivial.
With this in mind, it is interesting to note that in chapter 7 applicative verb forms
were described as possibly being more lexicalised than other verb extensions. Whereas
the majority of verb extensions, with the possible exception of antipassive, appear
to be phonologically discrete morphemes which may be suﬃxed to any semantically
appropriate verb, the applicative has a number of forms, the choice of which is lexically
driven. Moreover, unlike most verb extensions, some forms of the applicative harmonise
with the vowels of the root suggesting a closer ‘connection’ between the root and the
aﬃx. Following Kaye’s (1989; 1995) hypothesis that the main purpose of phonological
phenomena is to facilitate parsing, these facts might be taken as evidence that the
applicative suﬃx is not stored as a separate lexical entry, but that applicative verb
forms are stored in the lexicon as a unit.
If this is so, it is straightforward to deﬁne a lexical entry (9.32) for an applicative
verb such as mʊnɪtá in (9.31) which constructs a partial tree with three argument nodes
as in (9.33).

appears to be obligatory, that is, pro-drop is not permitted for indirect objects.6 The
verb therefore decorates the indirect object node with a requirement for a formula
of type e rather than with a metavariable. Also, if a lexical analysis is the correct
approach, it implies that the dative a in this case is simply a case marker of the noun,
marking the fact that it decorates the lowest argument node (the indirect object) of
6I have not found any examples of an applicative verb with an implied indirect object, and given that

"4.3 Number marking and gender
It was demonstrated in section 4.2 that nominal agreement in Katcha is based on three
gender classes and that semantic number is not relevant to agreement. However, this
is only half the story. The nouns presented in (4.12)-(4.21), some semantically singular
and some semantically plural, and the uncountable nouns presented in (4.22) are all
morphologically unmarked for number. In such cases there is no apparent correlation
between number and gender; the gender of any given noun is indeed insensitive to
its number. However, when a noun carries morphological number marking, whether
singulative or plurative, the number-marking aﬃx determines its gender. This can be
demonstrated by looking at the gender properties of the nouns given in section 4.1
above. The data are presented in this section in the same groupings as in section 4.1,
i.e. by number aﬃx, and their gender class is noted. The gender of each noun was
established by checking the gender agreement markers (as noted in table 4.1) present
on possessors (such as those given in (4.12-4.21)), on demonstratives (4.23), or on verbs
(4.24).

Ordering nouns by number aﬃx in this way will demonstrate that for nouns with
a number-marking aﬃx, gender classiﬁcation is a property of the aﬃx and not the
root. In each of the following data lists (4.25-4.33) the gender of the marked form is
consistent for each aﬃx. This has the further consequence that the gender of a noun
in the plural may diﬀer from that used in the singular, in fact, this is usually the case.","[70, 71]"

shattering where neither the agent nor the patient are speciﬁed. This is exactly what
might be expected from a verb carrying both antipassive and unaccusative morphology,
but it does not appear to capture the fact that it was stones which shattered in the
situation being described. In fact, this is only an apparent problem. Epsilon terms
carry inherent existential force, meaning that the situation described in (8.47) involves
not only a shatterer and a shatteree, but also stones. This is most clearly seen when the
formula in (8.47) is translated into a formula of standard predicate logic. Algorithmic8.5. Middle Voice177rules for this conversion (‘Q-Evaluation Rules’) are deﬁned in Kempson et al. (2001:241243). Applying them to (8.47) results in (8.48).
(8.48) ∃x∃y∃z[Stones′ (x) ∧ Shatter′ (x)(y) ∧ Shatter′ (z)(y) ∧ Shatter′ (z)(y)]
The proposition in (8.48) is true just in case there are stones which shattered, while
the agent of the shattering is unspeciﬁed. From a truth conditional point of view, this
interpretation is exactly the same as the interpretation of the unaccusative. Given the
similarities between the middle voice and the unaccusative noted in table 8.1 and in
section 7.2.4, this is a welcome result. It is notable that the treating the verb as having
both an unaccusative and an antipassive morpheme still results in an unaccusative
interpretation. As may be clear from the derivation just outlined, this is because the
unaccusative suﬃx precedes the antipassive and is processed ﬁrst. It is therefore the
unaccusative which determines the tree position of the term projected by the sentential
subject (step (8.43) above). The incremental nature of the parsing process is therefore
crucial in providing the correct interpretation.11
The Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as having internal complexity is also key
to this explanation. The unaccusative suﬃx expresses the external argument of the
predicate (some arbitrary shatterer), while the antipassive suﬃx expresses the internal
argument of the predicate (some arbitrary shatteree). If the terms projected by these
morphemes did not have internal structure, there would be no room for a lexical argument in addition (i.e. the syntactic subject stones). But because terms are construed
as epsilon terms, it is possible for the term ϵx , Stones′ (x) to be incorporated into the
term projected by the unaccusative morpheme, and ultimately to surface in the ﬁnal
propositional formula as ∃x[Stones′ (x)]. The internal structure of arguments essentially
allows the three argument-projecting morphemes to instantiate two argument roles, and
to do so quite naturally.
The truth conditional interpretation of (8.48) is entirely expressed by the ﬁrst two
conjuncts. The third and fourth conjuncts are superﬂuous from a semantic point of
view. But as noted above, Stevenson (1941:112) claims that the antipassive suﬃxes
‘sometimes intensify the meaning of the parent verb.’ Stevenson’s presentation of the
data on this matter is somewhat opaque and not entirely convincing. Nevertheless, it
is notable that adding the antipassive suﬃx to an unaccusative verb causes the ﬁnal
11
In section 7.2.5 it was noted that for some verbs, the unaccusative suﬃx appears to attach to the
antipassive, rather than to the transitive verb stem (7.22b). This causes a problem for the current
analysis. Parsing the two morphemes in order would result in the inverse of the analysis just described
for middle voice; such verbs would be expected to have an antipassive interpretation. In fact, their
interpretation is unaccusative with the apparent antipassive morpheme seeming to make no semantic
contribution. It is not clear how these data might be integrated into the analysis as it currently stands,
other than it was noted in section 7.2.5 that there is some evidence that verbs with the antipassive are
(or may be becoming) more lexicalised than other VE forms. It may be that some of these ‘antipassive’
verbs are better treated as genuinely intransitive verbs.","[194, 195, 196]"

another but taken together they seem to describe the Katcha data. In Katcha, verbs
marked with -ncaːna express the notion that the subject is both ‘initiator’ and ‘endpoint’ to the extent that, in the draft Katcha New Testament, <njaana> is sometimes
written as a separate word and glossed as ‘one another’. However, the verb appears to
express a single event with a single participant, with the subject an aﬀected participant
rather than an agent. Examples are given in (7.24-7.26).6

(7.27), which is the active equivalent of (7.24), it can be seen that the morphologically
simple verb aɲala is transitive, taking an overt object tʊmːa ‘words/news’. In (7.24),where aɲalancaːna carries the Middle Voice suﬃx, there is no syntactic object andtʊmːa has become the syntactic subject.","[156, 157]"

characterisation precludes (9.43a), where the dative noun decorates the open ?T y(e)
node in an applicative construction. To incorporate this possibility, dative a requires
a disjoint lexical entry with a disjunct making reference to the fact that an applicative

it is an applied argument (that is, whether the current node is an argument of the
ben ′ predicate projected by the applicative morpheme). If so, no action need be taken
and parsing may proceed. To allow this formally a ‘dummy action’ is carried out
duplicating the type requirement which already decorates the node and thus adding no
further information to the tree. If the node under development is not the argument
of such a predicate, the actions decorate the node with modal requirements expressing
the fact that the current node cannot be either the logical subject (?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)) or
the logical object (?¬⟨↑0 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩⟨↑1 ⟩T y(t)).
The lexical entry in (9.44) illustrates two diﬀerent ways in which context dependence
may be formalised. The actions of the second disjunct reﬂect the usual DS construal
of case, deﬁning the context in which the formula value of the node must ultimately
be interpreted (in this case the fact that it cannot be subject or object). These actions

"2.4. Fieldwork and other data sources212.4 Fieldwork and other data sources
The current study is based on data from the sources discussed above, but also original
data collected through ﬁeldwork in Khartoum between November 2012 and May 2013.
During this time I worked with two members of the Katcha community in Khartoum.
Both were male, aged in their forties and speakers of the Tuna dialect of Katcha. Both
men were born and grew up in the language area, speaking Katcha as their mother
tongue and in most childhood contexts, though being educated in Arabic from the age
of eight. However both had moved to Khartoum at relatively young ages and had lived
in Khartoum for many years (24 years in one case, 36 years in the other). Within
Khartoum both are active within the expatriate Katcha community and continue to
speak Katcha at home and socially. One of the men works as a mechanic and therefore
speaks Arabic at work, but the other is employed as a mother tongue literacy worker
within the Katcha community and therefore teaches, reads and writes Katcha as well
as speaking it most of the time. In addition to Katcha, both men are ﬂuent in Sudanese
Arabic and have a reasonable level of English.
My contact with Katcha speakers was largely limited to formal language sessions
with my two main contacts. The community were wary of foreigners coming to their
neighbourhood due to security concerns, so language sessions were conducted at my
house and I did not get much contact with the wider community. Once a week, I sat in
on a translation checking session with the Katcha Bible translation team (a further two
native speakers) and a translation consultant, though those sessions were conducted in
English.
Language sessions, which happened once or twice per week, were a mixture of controlled elicitation and text elicitation. In order to make the most of potentially limited
ﬁeldwork time, my controlled elicitation concentrated on morphosyntactic features of
the language, eg. agreement paradigms, rather than collecting vocabulary.
The data presented in this study is representative of the morphosyntactic data
collected during ﬁeldwork. Audio recordings were made of the majority of it. A list
of about 130 nouns in both singular and plural forms was also collected. In addition,
three oral texts were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Fieldworks Language
Explorer (FLEx) to create a small database of lexical and functional morphemes.
A further resource is the text of the draft Katcha New Testament. The translation
group have kindly granted me online reader access to their unpublished draft. The
draft is currently under revision, which means it has a tendency to change, and it is
translated material so may not necessarily always be in traditional Katcha cultural or
literary style, but it nonetheless represents a substantial corpus of textual data and
has proven a very helpful source of syntactic examples. An associated resource is the
list of verbs found in the text which is maintined by the translation consultant. This22Preliminaries: Backgroundcurrently lists approximately 470 verbs.
It should be noted that of these various sources of Katcha data, the vast majority
are written only. In particular the two largest sources, Stevenson’s (1941) grammar and
the draft Katcha New Testament are written with no tone and with some inconsistency
with regard to the balance between phonetic detail and morphophonemic consistency.
(More details are given on these matters in chapter 3.) Throughout this thesis I have
therefore tried to use my own data where possible and use examples from the Bible or
Stevenson’s data only sparingly, or to provide extra discussion for speciﬁc hypotheses.","[39, 40, 41]"
"6.1.1 Pronoun Set 1 - ‘Core’ pronouns
The primary function of the ﬁrst set of pronouns is to express the core arguments of a
sentence: the subject and the direct object (i.e. argument roles S, A and P). For this
reason, this set may be referred to as the Core pronouns. However as will be seen in
section 6.2, these forms also appear with certain prepositions, so they do also express
some peripheral arguments.
There are eight forms of the core pronouns, listed in (6.1). The 1st and 2nd person
pronouns distinguish singular and plural, while in the case of 1st person plural there is
a further distinction according to the inclusion or exclusion of the addressee. There are
three 3rd person pronouns, distinguishing grammatical gender (Masculine, Feminine
and Plural gender).

1sga a1pl.excl
1pl.inclʊŋːɔaŋːa2sgɔ ɔ2plaːka3mɪ ɪ3peːke3fɔːkɔThe forms given in (6.1) are the citation forms. In everyday use, however, they are
often subject to shortening and/or lenition. The presence of the glottal stop in the 1sg,
2sg and 3m forms is notable as these are the only words in which the glottal stop is
attested as a consonant of the language. However, in non-emphatic contexts the glottal
stop is frequently dropped and the pronouns realised as /aː/, /ɔː/ and /ɪː/ (or even
shortened to /a/, etc). Similarly (though less frequently), the 2pl and 3p forms may
be realised as /a:/ or /e:/.1
The pronominal forms in (6.1) are listed without reference to tone. The tone pattern
of core pronouns varies and it appears that this variation may be due to the pronoun’s
function in the sentence. That is, pronouns seem to be marked tonally for case. Where
the pronoun is the subject of its clause, it has a Low-Low melody, as in the second
clause of (6.2); where the pronoun is not the subject of its clause, it is more likely to

"In the case of arelative clause, this allows any verb to construct and decorate the restrictor node freely.
However, the value of the logical subject is already ﬁxed, it is necessarily identiﬁed with
the head noun. Thus a verb can only decorate the restrictor node directly when its
subject is identiﬁed with the modiﬁed noun; only subjects can be relativised directly.
In this, Katcha obeys the generalisations of Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility
Hierarchy, which states that subjects are more easily accessible to relativisation than
other NP positions, that positions on the hierarchy lower than subject may require to
be relativised using constructions other than the language’s ‘primary Relative Clauseforming strategy’, and that the alternative strategies are more likely to include the
use of resumptive pronouns. Interestingly, while Keenan and Comrie (1977) suggest a10.4. Non-subject Relative Clauses247psychological motivation for the hierarchy, the analysis of demonstratives given here
predicts (at least some aspects of) this observation from a formal, syntactic perspective.
As noted above, the ﬁnal analysis of non-subject relatives is likely to rest on the
analysis of the dependent clause marker, ka. Furthermore, any such analysis will
have to take into consideration the fact that the verb of the relative clause cannot
decorate the predicate/restrictor node directly. One possible approach is hinted at
by the connection between relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, mentioned in
section 10.3. It was noted there that possessives may be considered a type of relative,
but the inverse may also be considered to be true. Indeed, the morphological similarity
between the Katcha possessive construction and the non-subject relative construction
is quite noticable, to the extent that Stevenson (1956-57:64) states that for the nonsubject relative, ‘a genitive construction (with genitive particle or possessive pronoun)
is used’. It was suggested in chapter 5 that given the non-ﬁnite nature of non-subject
relatives, and given their appositional nature, an appropriate paraphrase of the noun
phrase in sentences such as (10.29) is to use constructions along the lines of ‘the hen
of Kuku’s seeing her.’ This is a reasonable position to adopt reﬂecting as it does the
morphological link between the ‘possessive particle’ and the ‘relativiser’, as well as
reﬂecting the non-ﬁnite nature of the verb.
One possible strategy for the analysis of non-subject relatives, then, might be to
see the non-ﬁnite clause as a nominalisation. The entire clause would then provide an
argument for the predicate represented in section 10.3 as P OSSD. If the predicate is
merely a ‘relation whose value is constructed from some contextually provided value’
(Kempson et al. 2001:145), it may be too restrictive to think of it as possession. In that
case, there is no reason why the relation should not hold between the referent of the
head noun and some more abstract entity, such as an event of seeing. Such an approach
would lead to a ﬁnal epsilon-structure along the lines of that sketched in (10.31), where
the internal structure of ϵx , Hen′ (x) is suppressed, SEEING′ is shorthand for some event
of Kuku seeing some object, and P OSSD is the relation that holds between this event
and x.","[265, 266]"
"11.2.1 Verb extensions
Katcha verbs are inherently transitive. If it is semantically plausible for a verb to be
transitive, this is always the basic form. Katcha verb extensions decrease valency; their
function is to license the absence of a syntactic argument. Most of these VEs decrease
semantic valency in addition to syntactic valency, presenting the event described by the
verb as having only one participant (though this is not the case for the passive). Katcha
has a complete paradigm of valency decreasing verb extensions, allowing originally254Theoretical Analyses: Conclusionstransitive verbs to have either one or two arguments and for the subject to be either
agent or patient.
Verb extensions were analysed in chapter 8, making use of the Dynamic Syntax
construal of terms as expressions of the epsilon calculus. The inherent internal structure
of epsilon terms allows a straightforward way to incorporate context dependence into
the account. An epsilon term represents an arbitrary witness of some predicate and
we can straightforwardly deﬁne this predicate as being dependent on the immediate
context. Thus it is straightforward to deﬁne structures such as ‘Kuku is laughing (at
whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in this instance)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by
whatever it is that beats drums)’.
In terms of the Katcha data, the approach outlined here allows us to neatly capture
the diﬀerence between (for example) an antipassive verb and a transitive verb with no
overt object. A transitive verb decorates its logical object node with a metavariable: a
term whose content is underspeciﬁed and requires subsequent update. In the case of
a transitive verb without an overt object, this update will come from context. In the
case of the antipassive, the update comes from the suﬃx, which supplies a contextually
deﬁned epsilon term. The same is true for the other suﬃxes which reduce semantic
valency, unaccusative and middle voice. Although the denotational content of the
epsilon term is minimal, it decorates the object node and so prevents it from being
instantiated from context by something with more substantive content. Thus ‘Kuku
is laughing’ is semantically diﬀerent to ‘Kuku is laughing at something’, despite the
same inherently transitive verb and an equally indeterminate ‘object’ being used in
both cases. This analysis might be extendable to languages without morphological
antipassives such as for detransitivized verbs in English; there are clear semantic
diﬀerences between ‘Everyone was reading’ and ‘Everyone was reading something’.
The analysis given here for Katcha construes a ‘missing’ argument as being represented
by an arbitrary semantic object with properties dependent on context. It is quite
straightforward to deﬁne lexical actions which specify the properties of the restrictor
and thereby use this formalism to model highly context-dependent semantic objects.","[272, 273]"

passive suﬃx is parsed separately. The suﬃx then simply has the eﬀect of moving the
pointer from the external argument node to the internal argument node (8.31):

In this case the lexical actions associated with the passive suﬃx (8.31) check that
the pointer is on the logical subject node (⟨↑0 ⟩?T y(es → t)) and that it still requires
a formula value (?∃x.F o(x)). The latter condition prevents a successful parse of the
passive suﬃx where the logical subject node has already been decorated by the preverbal
syntactic subject. In other words, a verb marked with a passive suﬃx is incompatible
with the syntactic subject being interpreted as agent. If these conditions are met, the
lexical actions simply move the pointer on to the logical object node, and then the
parse proceeds as for transitive verbs. Thus in parsing (8.29), the subject and verb
are parsed, giving the tree in (8.32).9 The passive suﬃx is then parsed and its actions
move the pointer to the logical object node, where the metavariable may be resolved
by uniﬁcation with the unﬁxed node, as in (8.33).
The internal structure of the term projected by the syntactic subject, ϵx , Food′ (x)), is not relevant,
so it is suppressed for clarity. As usual lambda operators and their variables are also suppressed.

it remains decorated by a metavariable and a formula requirement. An appropriate
referent for the agent therefore has to be found, substituted from context if there is no
suitable linguistic referent. This characterisation of the passive therefore ensures that
there is always a referential argument reading for the agent, i.e. that there is always
a semantic agent, even if this is only implied. Once the agent node is decorated with
an appropriate agent the ﬁnal logical form is as in (8.34), which is of course truthconditionally equivalent to its active counterpart.","[184, 185, 186]"
"Only subjects can be directly relativised in Katcha. There is no subject agreement
marker on the verb in a relative clause, being replaced by the relative marker. Verb
stems always begin with a vowel, and the vowel of the (ﬁrst) relative marker in subject
relatives elides. At the end of the relative clause is the marker já/mɔ́/nɔ́. Both relative
markers display agreement with the gender of the head noun (5.18):

Non-subject relatives are formed in a similar, but slightly diﬀerent, way. As with
subject relatives, the subordinate clause is enclosed by relative markers which show
agreement with the head noun. However, the internal structure of the relative clause
is diﬀerent: a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked by the dependent clause marker ka
(and sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). A resumptive pronoun is also common; this
does not occur in the case of subject relatives. (5.19a-c) give examples of direct objects
being relativised for masculine, feminine and plural gender nouns respectively. (5.20)
demonstrates the relativisation of an indirect object and (5.21) gives an example of an
oblique argument being relativised. Note that in these examples the word following the
(intial) relative marker, the subject of the relative clause, begins with a consonant and
the relative marker is consequently realised as [já/má/ná], rather than the [j-/m-/n-]
seen in the subject relative examples.

Where the subject of the relative clause is a personal pronoun the oblique formof the pronoun is used. All pronouns begin with vowels; the vowel of the relative
marker assimilates to the vowel of the pronoun and the relative marker cliticises to
the pronoun. (5.22a-c) give examples of object relatives beginning with a pronoun
(for masculine, feminine and plural gender nouns respectively), while (5.23) gives an
example of an oblique relative clause beginning with a pronoun.

In Katcha adjectives do not form a separate grammatical category, but are a type of
verb. There is some evidence of a slight morphological distinction between adjectival
verbs and more prototypical verbs (an additional morpheme marking semantic plural
in the case of adjectives), but with regard to agreement, adjectives show normal verbal
morphology and behave in the same way as any other intransitve verb.
When used predicatively as in (5.28-5.30b), adjectives take the usual verbal subject
agreement preﬁxes (cf 5.28-5.30a).

When used attributively, adjectives occur in a (subject) relative clause, as would
any other intransitive verb:

‘The long spear is brown’
As with any other subject relative clause, when the modiﬁed noun is not a core
argument of the verb, this is marked by the addition of t- before the clause-initial
relative marker:
(5.34) a a n-afʊ́ŋŋɔ́ kátɪŋkéré [tá-n-áɓɔ́tɔ̂ɓɔtɔ1sg 1sg-sleep loc bed

Assuming attributive adjectives to be relative clauses, there are three kinds of nominal
modiﬁers in Katcha: demonstratives, possessive noun phrases and relative clauses.
These are indicated by the presence of the morphemes listed in table 5.2. Aside from
the medial and distal demonstratives, these three types of nominal modiﬁers are clearly
all related. All three are introduced by similar morphemes showing agreement with the
head noun. It is worth considering the nature of this relation in more detail and in
particular, the question of whether the proximal demonstrative, the possessive marker
and the relative marker are all the same morpheme and, if so, how this chould be
characterised.
Stevenson (1941) takes a conservative descriptive line, taking the common element
to be just the j-/m-/n- gender agreement preﬁxes, which then attach to diﬀerent
morphemes. Thus, in his view, these gender preﬁxes may attach to the demonstrative
stem -a/-ɔ (Stevenson 1941:58), to the ‘genitive particle’ -a (Stevenson 1941:47) and‘possessive pronouns’ eːte, etc. (Stevenson 1941:48), and to verbs (Stevenson 1941:68).
Although Stevenson does not explicitly state it as such, this approach essentially
analyses the j-/m-/n- preﬁxes as a general marker of nominal modiﬁers. However,whilst it seems correct to a large extent, such an analysis does not go far enough in
that it does not incorporate the medial and demonstrative pronouns, which agree in
gender with the head noun, yet do not carry these preﬁxes. This fact is signiﬁcant for
the hypothesis that j-/m-/n- are preﬁxes which mark modiﬁcation generally, because
whilst the existence of a ‘general modiﬁcation’ marker does not preclude the existence
of other constructions, it is surprising to ﬁnd that the possessives and relatives pattern
with the proximal demonstrative, while the medial and distal demonstratives do not.
The remainder of this chapter proposes an alternative analysis which uniﬁes the account
of the three types of nominal modiﬁer, ﬁts the overall patterns of Katcha morphosyntax,
and accounts for the medial and distal demonstratives. The proposed analysis is that
all nominal modiﬁers in Katcha are headed by an initial demonstrative pronoun.

Theoretical Analyses147Chapter 8Verb Extensions
Introduction
In chapter 7, it was noted that the majority of verb extensions in Katcha are detransitivising and that these valency-reducing VEs can be classiﬁed according to two features,
namely the thematic role played by the syntactic subject and the number of arguments
expressed. This classiﬁcation is summarised in table 7.1, repeated here as table 8.1.

(Process)Table 8.1: Valency-reducing verb extensions and their argument rolesThe distinction between active and antipassive, and between passive and unaccusative/middle voice, is an important one. Katcha is pro-drop, so any semantic
argument may be phonologically unrealised. However, the active (unmarked) form
and the passive form of the verb each take two semantic arguments. Note that while
passive may be deﬁned as reducing the verb’s syntactic valency by demoting the agent to
the status of a (usually implied) oblique argument, the semantic valency is unchanged:
there exists both an agent and a patient, even if the agent is only there by implication.
This contrasts with the other forms, the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice,
each of which take only one semantic argument.
Valency reduction is something of a challenge for standard formal semantics.1 A
1Proponents of ’radical dissociation’ do not have this problem, but Dynamic Syntax takes a classical149150Theoretical Analyses: Verb Extensionstransitive verb expresses a relation, which by deﬁnition requires two arguments, raising
the question of how a proposition with a ‘missing’ argument should be modelled. One
approach is to allow the ‘missing’ argument role to be taken by some object of minimal
semantic content, an object whose reference is both arbitrary and entirely contextdependent. Thus the agent of some unaccusative verb V in a given situation s is simply
‘the V er in s’. An unaccusative sentence like ‘Drums are beaten’ can be thought of
informally as meaning ‘Drums are beaten (by the agent of drum-beating)’ or ‘Drums are
beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’. This contrasts with passive verbs, which
have two semantic arguments, even if the agent happens to be phonologically unrealised.
A passive sentence like ‘Drums are being beaten’ can thought of informally as ‘Drums
are being beaten (by him/her/it)’ or ‘Drums are being beaten (by someone/something)’.
This chapter presents a Dynamic Syntax analysis of such constructions. Section
8.1 introduces the DS formalism and illustrates its use in a straightforward Katcha
sentence with an active, transitive verb. Section 8.2 introduces the concept of epsilon
terms. Dynamic Syntax construes all terms as terms of the epsilon calculus, and this
provides a straightforward way to model the kind of term described in the previous
paragraph . An epsilon term picks out an arbitrary witness of some predicate and this
predicate can be easily deﬁned as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus
the epsilon calculus allows us to deﬁne, with relative ease, structures such as ‘Kuku is
laughing (at some arbitrary object of Kuku’s laughter)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by some
arbitrary agent of drum beating)’ and section 8.2 presents an analysis of antipassive
verbs in Katcha in these terms. It is argued that the lexical actions associated with the
antipassive suﬃx build a context-dependent epsilon structure at the logical object node.
Section 8.3 discusses passives, the implementation of which is very straightforward: it
is simply a case of moving the pointer to ensure that the sentential subject decorates
the logical object node. This analysis highlights the fact that the passive has a more
referential interpretation for the agent, in contrast with the arbitrary interpretations
of the ‘missing’ arguments of the antipassive, unaccusative and middle voice. Section
8.4 discusses unaccusative, the analysis of which is straightforward, following directly
from the discussion in the previous two sections. Section 8.5 is slightly more speculative,
considering what the analysis of middle voice might look like if it were to be treated as a
sequence of unaccusative, followed by antipassive. Somewhat remarkably, under such an
analysis, middle voice turns out to be truth conditionally equivalent to unaccusative but
to carry extra information which might be interpreted as adding intensity, as suggested
by Stevenson (cf section 7.2.5).
view of predicate-argument relations.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"
"10.2. Subject Relatives233In (10.15′ ), the pointer is at the root node of the LINKed partial tree. However,
there is an oustanding ?T y(t) requirement at its argument daughter which must be
fulﬁlled. As noted above, one way of fulﬁlling this requirement is by Substitution
of the metavariable with an epsilon-term and abduction of the necessary structure
from that. However, all rules in DS are optional and in the case of the relative clause
Substitution does not apply; the pointer is therefore compelled to move to the node
with the unfulﬁlled requirement. With the pointer now at the ?T y(t) node, the verb of
the relative clause can be parsed in the usual way, followed by the object noun. It is
instructive to note that in a subject relative clause, the verb does not carry the subject
agreement marker which is obligatory in other ﬁnite environments. This is reﬂected
in the analysis given here, where the subject node has already been decorated by the
demonstrative pronoun. A full DS analysis of Katcha verbs falls outwith the scope of
the current study, but it is plausible to suppose that the obligatory subject agreement
marker in a ﬁnite clause may be an ‘incorporated pronoun’ which decorates the logical
subject node and that the verb projects the predicate and (where appropriate) object
nodes. In the case of a relative clause an alternative pronoun, the demonstrative,
decorates the subject node. Parsing the verb and object of the relative clause then
gives the tree in (10.20).","[251, 252]"
"9.7 Conclusion
The basic proposal advanced in this chapter is that prepositional phrases should be
treated as adjuncts. A prepositional phrase speciﬁes an additional property of some
expression of the matrix proposition. In other words, it provides a predicate which
takes such an expression as one of its arguments. That expression may be a term (an
individual or event) in the case of an adjectival PP, or a predicate in the case of an
adverbial PP. In Dynamic Syntax terms, prepositions induce structure which is LINKed
to the matrix propositional tree and which shares semantic content with some node in
the matrix tree.
The approach to prepositional phrases proposed here treats adjectival prepositions
somewhat diﬀerently to adverbial prepositions. Adjectival PPs are of type e → t while
adverbial prepositions are of type (e → t) → (e → t). This distinction, of course,
is reﬂective of the semantics. An adjectival PP has an intersective interpretation; it
predicates over some term of the matrix proposition to express an additional proposition
concerning that term. An adverbial PP has a subsective interpretation; it predicates
over some predicate of the matrix proposition to express an additional property of that
predicate. Nonetheless, both are prepositional phrases and it should be expected that
they will behave in largely parallel ways. And in fact they do. Despite the diﬀerent
semantic types, all prepositions project a predicate that expresses some relation between
their complement and the expression that they modify. This relation is not part of
the core structure of the matrix proposition, but rather semantically enriches some
expression within it. This can be modelled quite naturally as a separate structure
connected to the modiﬁed expression by means of a LINK.
The construal of prepositional phrases as LINKed structures, and prepositions as9.7. Conclusion217predicates, explicitly categorises them as modiﬁers. There are therefore substantial
parallels to be seen between prepositional phrases and other modiﬁers. The distinction
between intersective and subsective PPs, for example, parallels the same distinction
seen in the semantics of adjectives. Indeed, Cann (In prep.) suggests an analysis for
English adjectives which directly parallels the one given here: intersective adjectives
induce LINKed structure from the internal variable of an epsilon term (ie. a T y(e)
node), while subsective adjectives induce LINKed structure from the restrictor of an
epsilon term (i.e. a T y(e → t) node). Similarly, the treatment of prepositional phrases
oﬀered here draws explicit parallels between (adjectival) prepositional phrases and
relative clauses. Both prepositional phrases and relative clauses project propositions
which share an argument with the matrix proposition. It is therefore not surprising
that they should use the same basic technical apparatus. The diﬀerence between them
is that relatives include an anaphoric device (either a relative pronoun or a resumptive
pronoun), which introduces the shared argument into their sub-proposition. Like bare
relatives in English, prepositional phrases contain no such anaphoric device so the
shared argument must be introduced by the LINK-COPY Introduction rule.
Sections 9.5 and 9.6 demonstrated that this analysis is also relevant to constructions
other than prepositional phrases, and both applications have potential theoretical
implications. In section 9.5 it was argued that applicatives can be treated in just
the same way as prepositions, a stance which gains support from the fact that in many
languages the two constructions are related by both a semantic equivalence and by
a history of grammaticalization. The diﬀerence between the two constructions is one
of constituency: the complement of a preposition immediately follows it, whereas the
applied object (which is construed as the complement of the applicative morpheme)
does not necessarily follow immediately after the applicative marker. To state that
applicatives and adpositions are essentially equivalent is therefore something of a
challenge to the importance of the notion of constituency, which is central to most
theories of syntax.
It was noted in several places, both in chapter 6 and in the present chapter, that
case markers and adpositions represent two ends of a continuum and that there is
no great diﬀerence between them. However, in discussing the diﬀerences between the
Dynamic Syntax construal of case and the account of adpositions given here, section 9.6
laid out what appears to be a quite clear distinction between them. Case is considered
to be a ﬁlter on well-formed structure, specifying where a particular node may be
situated in a tree, but providing no semantic content. On the other hand, adpositions
induce a LINKed sub-tree, building semantic structure and contributing the Formula
value of its predicate. The account oﬀered here can therefore be argued to draw a
substantive theoretical distinction between case and adpositions; the two are quite
diﬀerent within the DS framework. This apparently goes against the general view that218Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casecase and adpositions are actually very similar. However, ‘similar’ is not the same
as ‘identical’. Payne oﬀers a ‘rule of thumb’ for distinguishing case markers from
adpositions which he suggests ‘probably works 90 percent of the time.’ This is the
notion that case marking is imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase
occurs, while adpositions may occur freely. By this deﬁnition, case may be ‘determined
by the grammatical requirements of the verb (or other case-governing element)… Adpositional phrases are usually (though not always) “optional” sentence constituents’
(Payne 1997:100-101). The discussion of case and adpositions in section 9.6 might be
thought of as something close to a DS-theoretic characterisation of this ‘rule of thumb’.
With case, the propositional structure and semantic content is projected by the ‘verb
(or other case-governing element)’; case markers simply decorate this structure with
requirements to ensure the correct interpretation of the noun phrase. Adpositions on
the other hand are ‘ “optional” sentence constituents’ because they construct a tree
structure and decorate it with semantic content; moreover, the structure they project
is an adjunct, a LINKed sub-tree. The two deﬁnitions of the diﬀerence between case
and adpositions have a slightly diﬀerent focus though and so they are not quite the
same. Payne’s ‘rule of thumb’ focuses on the obligatoriness of case compared with
the optionality of adpositional constructions; the Dynamic Syntax account oﬀered here
suggests that the diﬀerence is semantic: case morphemes are semantically null and build
no structure, while adpositions contribute semantic content and also induce semantic
structure. The observation that adpositions tend to be more optional is a reﬂection
of the fact that, as modifying adjuncts, the structure they build is outside the main
propositional tree.
The application of Dynamic Syntax to Katcha prepositional phrases uses only
standard DS rules which have been motivated in other contexts for other constructions
in other languages. Nonetheless, applying these rules to the Katcha data considered
here has implications for our understanding of applicatives and case, as well as for our
understanding of prepositional phrases. The key insight oﬀered here is that prepositional phrases are predicates expressing additional information about some element of
the core proposition of an utterance.","[235, 236, 237]"
"7.4 Reciprocal and Reﬂexive
In (7.7), repeated here as (7.36), -ceːné is given as a possible Reciprocal suﬃx.
(7.36) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪcɪ ́ɓɪ ́ːɓáláKuku 3m.wake boy
‘Kuku wakes the boy’
b. laːlá ɪcɪ-n ́boys 3m.wake-recip
‘the children wake each other’
Given the pattern that exists in Katcha of verb extensions marking information about
the arguments of the verb, it is natural to suppose that the Reciprocal marker should be
considered to belong to this group of suﬃxes. However, there is also evidence that casts
doubt on this analysis, suggesting that the Reciprocal marker should not be considered
a suﬃx which changes the verb’s argument structure, but a pronominal element which
is the object of the verb.10 There are two pieces of evidence which might support the
latter view.
The ﬁrst comes from the form of the morpheme: it seems clear that the Reciprocal
marker is derived from either the Accompaniment preposition nca or the verb cɔ ‘go’
(which may be used to indicate directionality; see section 6.3.1), plus the 3rd person
plural pronoun ené. Thus it is literally ‘with/to them’. Of course the fact that the
Reciprocal marker looks like a pronoun does not prove that it is synchronically a
pronoun, rather than historically derived from one, but it may be.
The second piece of evidence comes from the fact that Katcha reﬂexives (which are,
of course, conceptually very similar to reciprocals) are not expressed using a verbal
suﬃx, but using an idiomatic possessed noun phrase, sometimes using ɔ́ːna, ‘body’, as
10It is not one of the goals of this study to develop a theory of wordhood in Katcha. I have no strong
opinions on whether -ceːné should be considered a suﬃx, clitic or word. However, if it could be shown
that -ceːné should be analysed as a separate word, that would rule out the possibility of it being a verb
extension.",[163]
"Theformer generally have a shorter, more neutral vowel, which is often subject to vowel
elision and harmony, both of which are very common general processes in Katcha.
The tone of this vowel appears to be high but these morphemes are frequently run
together with the following word (often eliding the vowel) such that it can be hard
to establish tone accurately. The vowel also has a tendency to harmonise to some
degree with the following vowel. So although generally written as <ya ma na>,
pronunciation may vary according to the vowel that follows (eg. [jɪ ́ mɪ ́ nɪ ]́ or [jɔ́ mɔ́nɔ́]). The vowel harmony is not always as complete as in some other contexts (the vowel
harmony between noun stem and number preﬁx, for example), presumably due to the
word boundary: /má kʊ́kkʊ̂/ does often sound closer to [m ́ gʊ́kʊ̂] than to [mʊ́gʊ́kʊ̂] or[mɔ́gʊ́kʊ̂]. It can be diﬃcult to distinguish the exact vowel quality though, because the
vowel is often very short or, as noted above, elided altogether in the case of a following
vowel. This is in marked contrast with the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morphemes which have slightly
longer, more pronounced vowels. They are much less prone to elision before a vowel
and carry an exceptionally high tone.
Signiﬁcantly, the syntactic distribution of these forms is complementary within the
noun phrase: já/má/ná (possessive marker and clause-initial relative marker) occurs atthe beginning of a nominal modiﬁer; já/mɔ́/nɔ́ (demonstrative and clause-ﬁnal relative
marker) occurs only at the end. There is a strong argument therefore that the phonetic
diﬀerences are to do with phrasal intonation. The já/mɔ́/nɔ́ marker occurs at the end
of the noun phrase; importantly, it generally occurs before a pause. This, combined
with the extra-high tone, serves to give it a notable emphasis. In the case of the
demonstratives, there is naturally something contrastive about their semantics, and it
would seem to be this that is reﬂected in the intonation. Relative clauses are generally
parenthetical; again the intonation seems to reﬂect this with a higher than usual tone on
the clause-ﬁnal relative marker and a pause before continuing with the matrix clause. In
contrast, the já/má/ná marker occurs at the beginning of the modiﬁer and consequently
does not carry the same contrastive or parenthetical intonation. It behaves like most
short non-lexical Katcha words (eg. prepositions): undergoing vowel harmony, elision,
etc.
Evidence that the diﬀerence between já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is primarily intona-tional can be seen in example (5.35), where the demonstrative morpheme nɔ́ occurs at
the end of a left-dislocated object noun phrase a tʊ́mːá nɔ́, ‘these words’:5.4. A uniﬁed analysis for nominal modiﬁers
(5.35) atʊ́mːá nɔ́a a n-asáːsa79t-atɪrna áːkátop words dem.p 1sg 1sg-want inf-tell 2pl
‘I want to tell you these words’(TEACH:1.48)In this case, there is no contrastive intonation or pause and the vowel of the demonstrative is elided before the pronoun: [adʊ́mːánáː]. Thus this is an example of demonstrativenɔ́ being realised as n- before a vowel, exactly as the possessive/relative markers ná
would be, apparently due to the intonational properties of its position in the sentence.
Note that (5.35) is not an example of a relative marker: the subject pronoun is in
the wrong case (nominative rather than oblique), the verb is ﬁnite and there is no
corresponding clause-ﬁnal relative marker. All of these indicate that this sentence is
made up of a single main clause (in addition to the fact that there is no other candidate
for a matrix verb in this sentence). The analysis of this noun phrase as a left-dislocated
demonstrative phrase also concurs with the translation provided by Katcha speakers
and the spelling suggested by them (<no> rather than <na>).
Some additional evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are allomorphs comes from
the spelling conventions used in literature written by Katcha speakers (in particular,
the draft Katcha New Testament). When possessive and clause-inital relative markers
(já/má/ná) occur with the oblique argument marker t- they are consistently written as
<tiya tamo tano>3 even when preceding a vowel. When these markers occur without
the t- and precede a vowel, they are consistently written as a preﬁx <y-/m-/n->.
When they occur without the t- but precede a consonant, they are generally written
as <ya/ma/na>. Thus the same morpheme may be spelled three ways according to
context. Signiﬁcantly, spellings with <-o> and spellings with <-a> are both used
in diﬀerent contexts for what is clearly the same morpheme, despite the fact that
this spelling alternation does not reﬂect the phonetic realisation. Spelling habits
should certainly not be taken as conclusive (it may simply be that certain spellings
are becoming conventionalised in the vernacular literature), but they may be extra
evidence that Katcha speakers do not distinguish between these morphemes.

The team also sometimes write <tammo> and <tanno>, but I am not convinced the consonant is

"5.6 Conclusion
There are, phonetically, ﬁve sets of morphemes marking nominal modiﬁers in Katcha,
namely j-/m-/n-, já/má/ná, já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû. These serve various
functions, marking proximal, medial and distal demonstratives, possessives, subject
relative clauses and non-subject relative clauses. As implied by table 5.2, the correlation
between the surface phonetic form of the morpheme and its syntactic function is
not completely clear. To reduce this mix of forms and functions to something more
systematic is obviously desirable from the point of view of analytical elegance. However,
it is also desirable for data-driven reasons: with the exception of the medial and
distal demonstrative pronouns, there is considerable uniformity in the form of nominal
modiﬁers and an understanding of how they are related would shed considerable light
on the workings of the language.
With regard to the similarities of form, it was argued in section 5.4.1 that there
is in fact only one ‘j/m/n-style’ morpheme, with the variant pronunciations due tointonation-based allomorphy. This leaves three forms to give an analysis for: i ́nːi ̂/umːû,ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and já/mɔ́/nɔ́. The ﬁrst two of these are uncontroversial, being the distal
and medial demonstrative pronouns respectively. The third includes the proximal
demonstrative pronoun, but is also used in all other nominal modiﬁers. One possible
analysis of the syntactic function of this latter morpheme is that it simply marks
modiﬁcation generally. However, this does not account for the fact that the medial
and distal demonstratives do not exhibit this marking, whereas the proximal demonstrative, along with relative clauses and possessive noun phrases, does. In section
5.4.2 it was therefore argued that a better analysis is to assume that the three forms
já/mɔ́/nɔ́, ékê/ɔkɔ̂ and i ́nːi ̂/umːû represent the three demonstrative pronouns and that
other Katcha nominal modiﬁers are phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun. All
modiﬁers stand in a relationship of apposition to the modiﬁed noun. This approach
allows a uniﬁed treatment of the various types of modiﬁer, including the medial and
distal demonstratives. It is supported by the fact that there are no words in Katcha5.6. Conclusion93which can be unambiguously categorised as determiners or adjectives; lexical nouns
appear to form complete noun phrases which do not allow phrase-internal modiﬁcation.
Nominal modiﬁcation is therefore achieved by apposition of an external phrase.
Finally, as noted in section 5.5, the analysis adopted here can be placed in a wider
context within African linguistics. The demonstrative which heads the appositional
modiﬁer shows gender agreement with the head noun, thereby encoding the function
of ‘Attribution’ and connecting the modiﬁer with the head. In this way it acts as
a relative marker of the type found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages. A
prototypical relative marker is not a pronoun and indeed the demonstrative does not
show the subordinate clause case marking that would be expected of a relative pronoun.
Nonetheless, it was argued in section 5.4.2 that the demonstrative is best considered
to be a pronoun. So it is not a fully prototypical relative marker, though it may be
in process of being grammaticalized as such. Similarly, the possessive construction in
Katcha does not alter the form of the head noun and therefore is not quite an example
of the construct state found in many African languages, but it does represent the
kind of structure from which such a phenomenon could develop. Construing nominal
modiﬁers as appositional phrases headed by a demonstrative pronoun not only provides
a uniﬁed analysis of the Katcha data, but also gives an example of one way in which
two seemingly unrelated, typically African constructions might derive from a common
source.","[111, 112]"
"10.2. Subject Relatives231In order to fulﬁll the requirements of the ?T y(t) node, the partial epsilon-tree
projected by the demonstrative must be updated to a fully speciﬁed epsilon-tree. This
implies that the term which updates the metavariable through Substitution brings
with it a full epsilon-structure of functor and argument daughter nodes. When the root
node (the epsilon term) is substituted for the metavariable, some of these daughter
nodes will ‘overlay’ the existing nodes in the partial epsilon structure projected by the
demonstrative. However, none of this duplication is inconsistent and consequently the
nodes will collapse together harmlessly (10.19).

root node of the epsilon tree is updated by Substitution in the normal way. The
updates to the lower nodes are more reminiscent of the Unify action, in that two
(partially) decorated nodes are given the same tree node address and conﬂated. This
action is valid as long as there are no inconsistencies in the decorations on each node.
In the case of the binding operator node, the ι-operator is a more speciﬁc version of
the ϵ-operator, so there is no conﬂict here. In the case of the node decorated with the
nominal variable, this uniﬁcation is licit because the ‘two’ variables are by deﬁnition one
and the same. (‘Daisy’ can only refer to the same individual as ‘this one’.) In the case
of the intermediate node, the ?T y(t) requirement is resolved satisfactorily. Finally, the
restrictor is supplied in its entirety by the epsilon-term; there is no pre-existing node232Theoretical Analyses: Nominal Modiﬁersto cause any inconsistency.6
Assuming that the approach sketched above can be formalised within the DS system,
we now have a way of incorporating relative clauses into the account of demonstratives.
After parsing the demonstrative pronoun using the revised version of the lexical actions
(10.17), the tree is as shown in (10.15′ ), with the pointer at the node decorated by the

the case of a relative clause however, Substitution does not apply and the LINKed

This ﬁnal point, that the updating process includes the construction of the restrictor node, is
notable. The process described here is not merely one of Substitution of a Formula value as deﬁned
in Cann et al. (2005:72), but involves the abduction of structure. Formalising this process will require
to be done carefully, to ensure there is an appropriate trigger for the construction of structure, and
that monotonicity is retained; it is not clear that a free pragmatic process like substitution should
be allowed to build structure in an unconstrained manner. I leave this formality to one side for the
present.","[249, 250, 251]"

7.2.1 Antipassive
A verb suﬃxed with an Antipassive marker corresponds to Stevenson’s “Intransitive
Stem” (Stevenson 1941:110). There are two main Antipassive suﬃxes, the choice of
which appears to be lexically determined by the verb. Probably the more common is-VnV (7.8b-7.11b), while -VkV (7.12b-7.13b) is also attested. In both cases the quality
of the vowel in the suﬃx varies according to the vowel(s) in the verb root. The tone on
the suﬃx also varies but there does not seem to be any clear pattern to this variation.

A possible further example of an antipassive suﬃx is -rɪ as found in akʊ́rɪ ́ ‘eat (intrans)’(7.14b). This appears to be a unique suﬃx: no other examples of an antipassive -rɪ areattested in my data, and Stevenson also states that it it is ‘an unusual form’ (Stevenson
1941:110). In addition, there is no sign of the vowel harmony between suﬃx and root
which appears to exist for -VnV and -VkV. It may therefore be better to think of akʊ́rɪ ́
as a separate intransitive verb (though one clearly related to the transitive akʊ́).(7.14) a. kʊ́kkʊ́ akʊ́mɪ ́teeneKuku 3m.eat asida

This is rather striking in examples such as ‘wake’ (7.10a) and ‘laugh’ (7.11a). It is not
hard to conceive that a language might treat the intransitive ‘wake’ as the less complex
form, rendering the transitive with a causative or similar device. Similarly, it seems
intuitive that in English, intransitive ‘laugh’ is semantically more basic than transitive
‘laugh at’, a fact which is reﬂected in the morphosyntax. This is not the case in Katcha.
Morphologically at least, the transitive is always the simpler form, with the intransitive
being formed by the use of the Antipassive suﬃx.
Semantically, the Antipassive is used where the identity of the semantic theme or
patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. As a (relatively) fully
pro-drop language, a clause in which the patient is known or implied may be expressed
using an ordinary transitive verb. (7.15a) gives an example of a verb whose object,
being implied, is simply ‘dropped’. (For comparison, (7.15b) shows the same verb with
a full complement of overt object arguments.)
(7.15) a. n-aɗáŋŋá êːne

3f-givepl-yeark-áʈábbʊ́1pl.excl 3p-be.many‘she gives many years to us’(TEACH:1.60)Both the transitive and the antipassive forms of the verb, then, may occur with no
overt syntactic object. The key distinction between them is semantic: a transitive verb
with an implied semantic object is expressed using an unmarked transitive form; a
transitive verb with no object (implied or otherwise) is expressed using a verb with an
Antipassive suﬃx.
Stevenson (1956-57:58) states that the Antipassive suﬃx (which he calls ‘Qualitative’) may in fact be used with ‘indeﬁnite objects’, in which case it has a general or
habitual interpretation. He gives one example:
(7.16) bibala iyanaɓɪːɓala ɪja-ana
boyfɔeːfɔ3m.milk-antip cows‘The boy milks cows, (i.e. he cow-milks in general).’(Stevenson 1956-57:58)Although (7.16) has a syntactic object, it seems clear that the sentence does not
refer to an event in which any individual actually undergoes milking, i.e. the semantic
theme/patient has no denotation. To that extent, this construction is still in keeping7.2. Valency reducing suﬃxes133with the function of these suﬃxes. It is probably still appropriate to think of the suﬃx
as marking antipassive.27.2.2 Passive (‘Personal Passive’)
The suﬃx -tené marks a verb as passive. The subject agreement marker on the verb
agrees with the syntactic subject, which carries the thematic role of theme/patient:
(7.17) a. akkám-ʊnɪkʊ́rɪwoman 3f-cook food
‘a woman is cooking food’
b. kʊrɪ ʊnɪ-t n ́
food 3m.pfv-cook-pass
‘the food is being cooked’

manámbâ3m.hit drum‘the man is hitting a drum’
b. ambá m-abʊ-t n ́ kátábeːnedrum 3f-hit-pass loc wrestling
‘the drum is being hit for wrestling’
The -tené suﬃx is used where there is an implied agent and as such is described by
Stevenson as a “true passive” (Stevenson 1941:113). He states that ‘it often implies
that someone is implicated in the action, and may have a noun complement’ (Stevenson
1941:113), giving (7.19) as an example which includes an explicit agent introduced by
the dative preposition a or locative preposition ka:
(7.19) bibala abadh napupa thiyeniɓɪɓala abʊ-teneapʊppa tɪ-jaɪːnɪboyor ki
ka3m.hit-pass prep father non.core-3m.poss 3m‘The boy is beaten by his father’(Stevenson 1941:113)However, the presence of a noun phrase taking the role of agent, as in (7.19), does
not agree with my ﬁeldwork ﬁndings. In controlled elicitation sessions, I was unable
to elicit a passive sentence with an explicit agent, nor have I found any clearcut
2
This construction could perhaps be thought of as some kind of object incorporation, but I have no
examples of it in my own data, nor have I investigated compounding more generally.","[147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"
"9.4 Locative adverbs
(9.23) ak-oɗoak-atáɗák-étékɪ ́ʈáimp.pl-come imp.pl-stand.in.line loc-1sg in.front
‘come, line up in front of me’(THIEF:1.10)In chapter 6 it was noted that words such as kɪʈa in (9.23) are best described as locative
adverbs rather than as prepositional phrases headed by ka. It is now possible to expandupon this distinction. A prepositional phrase like kete in (9.1) modiﬁes a term (even
when that term is an event) and might therefore be described as adjectival. On the
other hand, a prepositional phrase like a kʊɓɓʊ in (9.15) modiﬁes a predicate and mighttherefore be described as adverbial. Analysing words such as kɪʈa as locative adverbs
suggests that they should be analysed in the same way as adverbial prepositional
phrases, that is, as type (e → t) → (e → t) predicates. It was also noted in chapter
6 that these adverbs add detail to the location provided by the locative prepositional198Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casephrase; in other words, they modify the prepositional phrase. Since the prepositional
phrase projects a proposition whose predicate is a locative relation, it is straightforward
to analyse the adverb as modifying this predicate.
Under this analysis, the processing of sentence (9.23) will proceed in the following
manner (ignoring the initial verb akoɗo for conciseness). As with all intransitive verbs,ataɗa , ‘stand’, projects a full propositional template, of type e → (es → t) including a
metavariable decorating the logical subject node and a term decorating the event node.
In the case of (9.23), the verb is in an imperative form. The imperative does two things:
ﬁrstly, it speciﬁes the addressee as the logical subject of the proposition; secondly, it
adds extra information marking the fact that the speaker desires the addressee to bring
about the event expressed by the proposition. Exactly how this is achieved formally is
not relevant to the current discussion, so I for now it is simply indicated by a +IMP
imperative marker on the propositional root node and the proposition is otherwise
treated as if it were declarative. I also assume that having parsed akataɗa, the logical
subject is correctly identiﬁed with the addressee (in this case, the group of boys):

can be parsed, decorating a LINKed propositional tree just as in sections 9.1-9.2 above.
The proposition projected by the prepositional phrase speciﬁes that the event to which
it is LINKed (si ) stands in a LOC ′ relation with the speaker (9.25).","[216, 217]"
"146Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Verb Extensionsnominals while (c-d) primarily aﬀect verbs. Katcha verb extensions are all of the
former type, licensing the presence or absence of arguments.
There are various morphemes related to argument structure which are potential
candidates for being classed as verb extensions. Of these, reﬂexives and reciprocals are
not encoded using verb extensions; Katcha uses a more analytic construction with a
noun or pronoun expressing the reﬂexive or reciprocal object.
The applicative is the only one of the Katcha verb extensions to increase valency.
This makes it something of a special case. However, it is also something of a special
case in that it is not typical of applicative constructions typologically. There is no alternative non-applicative construction with the same truth-conditional meaning. Also,
the additional argument it licenses is marked with the dative preposition a rather than
being a direct object, so in one sense this morpheme does not increase valency. Rather,
it introduces an oblique argument and so acts somewhat like a preposition. A Dynamic
Syntax theoretical analysis modelling applicatives from this point of view is given in
chapter 9.
If the ‘applicative’ does not in fact increase valency, then we can revise the statement
at the beginning of this section to say that all Katcha verb extensions decrease valency;
the function of all of them is to license the absence of a syntactic argument. This is
not surprising given that it was noted in section 7.2 that Katcha verbs are inherently
transitive. If it is semantically plausible for a verb to be transitive, this is always
the basic form. Most of these VEs decrease semantic valency in addition to syntactic
valency, presenting the event described by the verb as having only one participant
(though this is not the case for the passive). As shown in table 7.1, Katcha has a
complete paradigm of valency decreasing verb extensions. A theoretical analysis within
the framework of Dynamic Syntax is given for these verb extensions in chapter 8. This
range of VEs allows Katcha to use inherently transitive verbs to present an event as
involving either one or two participants, and to take either the semantic agent or the
semantic patient as subject, thereby providing alternative perspectives on the situation
expressed.","[164, 165]"
"8.2 Antipassive
(8.16) kʊ́kkʊ́ ɪ ́kɪ ́cé-éné
Kuku laugh.at-antip
‘Kuku is laughing’
As noted in section 7.2.1, the antipassive indicates that the identity of the semantic
theme/patient is unknown or unimportant to the point of non-existence. However, as
also noted there, the basic form of Katcha verbs is transitive; to analyse a verb like
ɪ ́kɪ ́céen
́ é as a simple one-place predicate would seem to go against the general pattern
of Katcha verbs.
The central insight in the analysis of a sentence like (8.16) therefore is that the
antipassive provides the semantic object for the verb and that this object is indeﬁnite,
arbitrary and completely dependent on the immediate context of the predicate and
its co-arguments in the given situation. In other words, the interpretation of (8.16)
is something like ‘Kuku is laughing (at whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in
this instance)’. Such an analysis is proposed within CCG by Steedman (2011) for
detransitivised verbs in English (such as ‘John is reading’), using dependent Skolem
terms to represent the indeﬁnite object. The Dynamic Syntax formalism, with its use
of the epsilon calculus to represent noun phrases, is well-suited to this type of analysis.
Furthermore, it is common within Dynamic Syntax to assume that propositions include
an additional argument which stands for the situation of evaluation (Gregoromichelaki
2006, 2011; Cann 2011). This situation argument is assumed to be of type es , that is
a subtype of type e. Cann (2011) argues that the semantic content of the situation
argument, like all other arguments of a proposition, should be modelled as an epsilon
term.5 For ease of exposition I ignore the internal content of the situation argument,
simply representing its formula value as an indexed variable, si . Where appropriate I
add informal restrictions, such as si,event(i) or si,state(i) . Incorporating this situation
argument into our account allows us to express the context-dependent nature of the
‘missing’ object quite naturally.
5This allows features such as tense to be construed as a restrictor on the temporal relation between
the event and the time of utterance or other reference point.",[176]

et al. (2001) describe it as a semantically relatively weak predicate, a ‘relation whose
value is constructed from some contextually provided value’ (Kempson et al. 2001:145).
The case they consider is the English genitive and so they consider the predicate to be
a binary relation with the possessor as its logical subject and the possessee as its logical
object. For simplicity, they represent the predicate as P OSS. In the Katcha case, the
logical subject of this possession relation is the variable representing the possessee which10.3. Possessive NPs245is projected by the demonstrative pronoun. The relation is therefore the inverse of that
suggested by Kempson et al. (2001), and for convenience is written here as P OSSD to
make the diﬀerence explicit. (It can be thought of as ‘x is possessed by y’.) At ﬁrst this
seems like a slightly clumsy approach — hypothesising an implict predicate which may
be construed one way in one language but exactly inversely in another — but there
are two points to be made in its defence. One is that if the value of the predicate is
contextually provided, it might well be expected to vary from language to language.
The second point is that this diﬀerence is not unmotivated, but in fact reﬂects the
morphology of the two languages rather neatly. English possessives are constructed
using a dependent-marking strategy, that is, with morphological marking (‘genitive
case’) on the modifying noun (the possessor). Contrastingly, Katcha possessives are
head-marking8 and are expressed using something much closer to a construct state,
as was noted in section 5.5.2. The Katcha ‘possessive marker’, ie. the demonstrative
pronoun, does not morphologically mark the head noun (the possessee), but it is
associated with it by agreement and anaphorically. So the apparent diﬀerence between
the two languages in the semantics of the possession predicate may in fact be exactly
what we should expect to see, given their contrasting marking strategies for possessives.
If so, far from being clumsy, this is a very nice result. The analysis of the demonstrative
pronoun given in section 10.2 is that it shares an argument variable with the noun it
modiﬁes. This analysis was motivated by the need to account for relative clauses. But
a side eﬀect of that analysis is that in the case of possessives the logical subject of the
possession predicate must be the shared variable, forcing the possession predicate to
be P OSSD rather than P OSS. This directly reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions, because Katcha uses (something close to) a head-marking construct
strategy rather than a dependant-marking genitive strategy.9
8Or at least, ‘head-aligned’, through agreement relations.
Although positing two alternative possession predicates reﬂects the morphology of possessive
constructions quite neatly, it is not obvious that such a distinction should exist in the semantics.
Assuming that the genitive construction in English and the possessive construction in Katcha express
the same semantic relation, it should perhaps be expected that there would be only one ‘P OSS-type’
relation. If so, the analysis given here forces this predicate to be expressed as the Katcha version with
the head, the possessee, as the external argument, rather than the inverse. Kempson et al. (2001)
make no strong claims for their assumed P OSS relation, describing it only as a relation whose value
is contextually provided, holding between the possessor and the possessee. Likewise, I do not wish to
make any strong claims about this predicate other than to suggest that if there is indeed only one such
relation, it is better to think of it as a property of the head noun, i.e. some relation holding between
the head noun and some modiﬁer.

Non-subject relatives are formed in the same way as subject relatives, the subordinate clause being introduced by a demonstrative pronoun and also being concluded
with one (probably to mark deﬁniteness). However, the internal structure of the relative
clause is diﬀerent – a non-ﬁnite verb is used, being marked with a dependent clause
marker (and sometimes an inﬁnitive). A resumptive pronoun marking the relativised
element is also common; this does not occur in the case of subject relatives.
A fully worked-out analysis of the internal structure of non-subject relative clauses
will be dependent on an analysis of the dependent clause marker ka and the discourse
properties of non-ﬁnite clauses, which is outwith the scope of the current study. However, it is possible to note a few points about how non-subject relative clauses may ﬁt
into the overall account of nominal modiﬁers.
On the basis of the analysis presented so far, it is obvious why non-subject positions
cannot be relativised. The lexical actions of the demonstrative pronoun, as deﬁned in
(10.17), construct the partial epsilon tree in (10.18), repeated here as (10.30).

"5.5.1 Relatives
Given the analysis of já/mɔ́/nɔ́ as a demonstrative pronoun, it might be assumed that
in a relative clause it would play the role of a relative pronoun. From a typological point
of view, this would be distinctly surprising. Cross-linguistically, relative pronouns are
an uncommon way of encoding relativization, and are largely non-existent in Africa.
Of the 166 languages whose subject-relativization strategies are surveyed in WALS
(Comrie and Kuteva 2013a), only 12 make use of relative pronouns. Of those, 11 are
European languages and the twelfth is North American. Furthermore, the majority of
relative pronouns are derived from interrogative morphemes; it is extremely rare for a
demonstrative to be the source of a relative pronoun. This contrasts with the case of
invariant relative complementizers, which often derive from demonstratives (de Vries
2002; Gisborne and Truswell 2016). A demonstrative pronoun acting as a relative
pronoun is therefore not something we would expect to ﬁnd in Katcha.
In fact, there are ways in which the demonstrative head of a relative clause in Katcha
does not act as a classic relative pronoun. The deﬁnition of the ‘relative pronoun
strategy’ used in WALS is that ‘the position relativized is indicated inside the relative
clause by means of a clause-initial pronominal element, and this pronominal element
is case-marked (by case or by an adposition) to indicate the role of the head noun
within the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). This is contrasted with the
‘gap strategy’ where ‘there is no overt case-marked reference to the head noun within
the relative clause’ (Comrie and Kuteva 2013a). Case-marking is therefore central to
Comrie and Kuteva’s deﬁnition. In section 6.6, it will be suggested that case on Katcha
pronouns may be indicated by tone. Since the tone on the demonstrative morpheme
appears to remain consistently high, this suggests that there is no case marking. So by
this deﬁnition, Katcha uses a ‘gap strategy’ for subject relatives, as would be expected
given its genetic and geographical location. Also, note that non-subject relative clauses
often utilise a resumptive pronoun (section 5.3). The internal syntax of non-subject
relatives is yet to be investigated (pending a study of dependent and non-ﬁnite clauses),
but a couple of implications can be drawn from this fact. Firstly, as with the gap
strategy for subject relatives, a resumptive strategy for non-subject relatives is not
out of place genetically or geographically (Comrie and Kuteva 2013b). Secondly, the5.5. Cross-linguistic connections89presence of a resumptive implies that it is this rather than the demonstrative which
encodes ‘the syntactic-semantic role of the head noun in the relative clause’ (Comrie and
Kuteva 2013c). By these deﬁnitions then, the demonstrative is not a relative pronoun
in the classic sense.
A better characterisation of the role of the demonstrative in Katcha relative clauses
is that it is a ‘relative marker’ (RM) in the sense described by de Vries (2002). Following
Lehman (1984), de Vries argues that there are three possible functions of a relative
element: Subordination, Attribution and Gap Construction (de Vries 2002:155), and
that an RM is a ‘type of relative particle that has just the Attribution function’ (de Vries
2002:170). That is, an RM encodes the fact that the relative clause is attributed to
the head. There are four distinctive characteristics of relative markers, all of which are
true for Katcha (de Vries 2002:174-176):
i) RMs are attested only in post-nominal relative clauses.
ii) RMs occupy the ﬁrst position in the relative clause.
iii) RMs show at least some overt evidence of agreement with the head noun.
iv) RMs are predominantly found in Afro-Asiatic and Niger-Congo languages.
When used in a relative clause, demonstrative já/mɔ́/nɔ́ is a relative marker encoding the function of Attribution, rather than a relative pronoun encoding Gap Construction. Gap Construction is concerned with the role of the relativised element within the
relative clause and is therefore marked by a pronoun (relative or resumptive) whose case
marks its role in the subordinate clause; Attribution is concerned with the relationship
of the relative clause to the head and is therefore ‘indicated by ϕ-feature agreement
with the head – i.e. person, number, gender, class (+ϕ, in short) – and placement at the
sentence border’ (de Vries 2002:157). To put this another way, relative pronouns of the
sort found in Europe are ‘dependant-focused’ and therefore exhibit the case required
by the dependant, whilst relative markers of the sort found in Africa are ‘head-focused’
and therefore agree with the head.","[107, 108]"
"6.6 Pronominal case
It has been argued throughout this chapter that the morphemes which specify oblique
argument roles in Katcha are better described as prepositions than as case markers.
This is on the basis that these oblique arguments do not generally have their form
assigned obligatorily by the verb. This is not the same for pronouns, the form of which
clearly is determined by some governing element, either the verb or a preposition. There
is therefore a strong argument for describing the forms of the pronouns as cases. This
is particularly true for the core pronouns where tone seems to play a role.
As noted in section 6.1.1, it may be that the case of the core pronouns is marked
by their tone melody. The use of tone to mark case is extremely rare in a global
perspective and arguably does not exist at all outwith Africa, but is common in eastern
Africa: ‘tone as a marker for case is the most salient feature of case behaviour in
Africa’ (König 2008:224). There are a couple of comments to be made regarding the
fact that Katcha may exhibit tonal case. One is a typological implication: the case
alignment is likely to be ‘marked-nominative’. Marked-nominative systems display the
same alignment as accusative case systems; that is, the subjects of both transitive
and intransitive clauses (the S and A arguments) are marked in the same way, while
the object of a transitive clause (the P argument) is treated diﬀerently. However, in
a prototypical marked-nominative language, the accusative form is functionally and
morphologically unmarked, acting as the default form, whilst the nominative form is
morphologically marked with its use restricted to the realisation of S and A arguments.
In that sense, marked-nominative systems are slightly reminiscent of ergative systems.
Like tonal case, marked-nominative systems are rare from a global perspective, but
‘constitute the most widespread type of case systems in Africa’ (König 2008:138). More
signiﬁcantly,
‘there is a connection between case expressed by tone and the existence of
a marked-nominative system… If case is expressed by tone then there is a
marked-nominative system.’ (König 2008:198,224)
Therefore it is to be expected that if Katcha has tonal case it will have a marked-124Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Pronouns and Prepositionsnominative alignment.9
A further interesting observation is that within tonal case systems it is particularly
common for low tone to be the marker of Nominative case, which appears to be the
case in Katcha. This tendency appears to be a universal feature of both the Cushitic
(Afro-Asiatic) and Nilotic (Nilo-Saharan) families. There are other language families
with tonal case which use other tone patterns to mark Nominative, but in Cushitic
and Nilotic, ‘the nominative is always expressed by loss of a high tone, triggering a
low tone’ (König (2008:223), citing Tosco (1994)). In the context of the ongoing debate
about the genetic aﬃliation of the Kadu family, this is notable because Katcha nominals
share characteristics with both of these families. The tripartite number marking system
described in chapter 4 as being common in Nilo-Saharan is particularly prevalent in
Nilotic, and this is also one of the few branches of Nilo-Saharan with a masculinefeminine gender system. Also in chapter 4, it was demonstrated that Katcha’s highly
unusual gender system is found in several Cushitic languages. So whether it is a genetic
or areal trait or a typological correlation, it seems that Katcha nominals do not only
share features of number and gender with Nilotic and Cushitic languages, but also case.
It is important at this point to state the caveat that there remains a great deal
that is unclear about the tonal system of Katcha, and a good percentage of my textual
data originally comes from written sources which do not mark tone at all. As such,
conclusions about tonal behaviour should be treated as tentative. It is plausible that
the diﬀerences in tone melody on pronouns which have been ascribed to case may in
fact be conditioned by other factors, such as intonation or position in the sentence.
Nonetheless, given its geographical location, it would not be surprising to ﬁnd case
marked by tone in Katcha.
If the tone variation on core pronouns is indeed a marker of the Nominative and
Accusative cases, it may be that the oblique form of the pronouns described in section
6.1.2 should also be thought of as a case, presumably ‘Oblique’ case. It is diﬀerent from
the tonal case exhibitied in core pronouns, however, in that it is not assigned by verbs
but by prepositions.
Pronominal case can be summarised as follows. The verb assigns tonal case, which
I tentatively take to be Nominative and Accusative, to the core arguments. Peripheral
arguments are not generally marked by case, but by prepositions (though see section
9.6 for discussion of the status of dative a). These prepositions also assign case, either
Accusative (section 6.2.1), Oblique (section 6.2.2) or a mixture of both (section 6.2.3).
9König (2008:198) suggests that this correlation is an absolute universal in the case of nouns, but
that with pronouns tonal marking may also be found in a few languages with accusative case alignment.
The question of whether Katcha nouns exhibit tonal case alternations remains open, pending a fuller
investigation of tone. It could be that case is only relevant to pronouns, in which case the possibility
exists that Katcha is one of the small number of exceptions with an accusative system realised by tone.","[142, 143]"

predicts the ungrammaticality of *akká mʊnɪtá kʊ́rɪ, because the applicative morpheme
is construed as projecting a (LINKed) requirement which entails parsing some additional lexical items to resolve it. The presence of the applicative morpheme entails
the presence of the benefactive argument. Nonetheless, the account as it stands is too
powerful. The lexical actions of the applicative marker duplicate those of LINK Introduction. Since LINK Introduction is an optional computational rule, there is no
need to also have a lexicalised version, rendering the analysis rather less elegant. More
importantly, it predicts that the benefactive noun phrase could occur grammatically
without the applicative morpheme being present, decorating a ?T y(t) node constructed
by LINK Introduction just like any other event-modifying preposition. Likewise,
this account predicts that any event-modifying preposition could follow the applicative
morpheme. The lexical actions of the applicative morpheme build a LINKed node
and decorate it with a ?T y(t) requirement; this is exactly the context for parsing a
preposition. Thus the current account incorrectly predicts that a sentence like *akkamʊnɪta kʊrɪ ka kʊkkʊ, with both an applicative verb and a locative phrase, should be
grammatical.
The problem with this account is that it ascribes the semantic content (ben ′ ) to
the ‘preposition’, leaving the applicative morpheme to undertake a purely structural
task (and one for which there is a pre-existing computational rule). Yet in prototypical
applicative constructions, the applicative morpheme clearly makes a semantic contri-210Theoretical Analyses: Adjuncts, Prepositions and Casebution (many languages have multiple applicative markers with diﬀerent meanings).
Likewise, in prototypical applicatives there is an alternation between semantically (if
not pragmatically) equivalent applicative and adpositional constructions. It should
therefore be expected that an applicative morpheme will in fact build the same semantic
structure as a preposition. A lexical entry for a prototypical applicative morpheme then
might look more like (9.40), which builds a LINK from an event node, but also builds
the LINKed propositional structure, decorating the nodes as appropriate (including a
Formula value for the predicate node), then moves the pointer back to the matrix tree.
These actions build the partial structure indicated in (9.41).

supported by the semantic equivalence that often exists between adpositions and applicatives and also by the fact that from the point of view of grammaticalization, adpositions are one of the primary sources for applicative morphemes (Peterson 2006:125129). Since there is a synchronic and diachronic connection between prepositions and
applicatives, it should not be surprising to ﬁnd that they are analysed in almost the
same way as one another. The major diﬀerence between the two constructions is that
the complement of an adposition is collocated with it in the string forming what would9.6. Case markers211in traditional grammar be termed a syntactic constituent, whereas the complement of
an applicative, the applied object, may be separated from it.
There are then two possible ways of analysing applicatives. The analytic approach
has a slight semantic advantage: it expresses the semantic role of the applied object by
projecting an additional predicate to related the applied object to the main proposition.
In Katcha there is only one possible role, benefactive, but other languages may have
more than one applicative morpheme assigning diﬀerent roles. The analytic analysis
as laid out here also captures the similarity in function between applicatives and
prepositions. The lexical approach has a slight empirical advantage: in Katcha there
are phonological indications that applicative verbs are more likely to be lexicalised than
verbs with other extensions.
It has been mentioned more than once that the Katcha applicative is somewhat
atypical. One of the ways this is true is the presence of the a marker before the
benefactive argument. If we adopt the analytic analysis of applicatives, where the
lexical actions of the applicative are essentially equivalent to those of an adposition,
the implication is that a is not a preposition. Rather its role is presumably simply
to mark which noun phrase is the applied object; in other words, it is a case marker.
Alternatively, if we adopt the lexical analysis, the benefactive argument is an argument
of the verb and so once again a must be a case marker. As noted above, the indirectobject of a ditransitive verb is also marked with a, which also supports the idea that ais a case marker that does not supply any substantive semantic content. A discussion
of case is the focus of the next section.","[227, 228, 229, 230]"

The lexical actions projected by the passive morphology therefore serve to ensure that

usual way, which means it will decorate the internal argument node.

two nodes are linked by the copy mechanism, so will end up being decorated with the
same Formula value. It just happens to be that the incremental nature of Dynamic
Syntax entails the lower node be instantiated ﬁrst. The tree can now be compiled as
normal, the pointer working its way up the tree compiling the epsilon term to decorate
the logical subject node of the propositional tree. The requirement for a formula value
on the propositional object node means that the pointer has to move down to that
node to update the metavariable there, which it will do using the value that has been
established for V during the process of constructing the epsilon term. The ﬁnal tree

‘the rocks split apart’(MATT 27.51)In section 7.2.4 it was suggested that although middles express the notion that
the subject is both ‘initiator’ and ‘endpoint’, they express a single event with a single
participant, in which the subject is primarily the patient. In this way, they are semantically similar to unaccusatives, a fact brought out in table 8.1. If table 8.1 represents an
accurate characterisation of the semantics of middles vis-a-vis unaccusatives, it seems
likely that the basic argument structure of the two forms will be the same. If the
primary diﬀerence between them is one of achievement vs process, this is a verbal
property that falls outwith the scope of the current study but will in all likelihood be
reﬂected in the properties of the situation argument.
In section 7.2.5, it was noted that the form of the middle suﬃx -ncaːna looks like aconcatenation of unaccusative -nca followed by antipassive -VnV, and it was also noted
that Stevenson (1941:112) claimed the -VnV suﬃx could mark intensiﬁcation. Bothof these possibilities were deemed less likely than an analysis of -ncaːna as a single
morpheme marking middle voice. Nonetheless, pursuing a compositional analysis of
the middle morpheme in which it is construed as being made up of unnaccusative-nca followed by antipassive -VnV provides some surprising results and turns out to be
worthwhile.
Ignoring for simplicity both the situation argument and the internal complexity of
the verb phrase in (8.40), the parse of a subject followed by a middle-marked verb
would begin by parsing the subject and verb stem in the normal manner (8.41).

"8.6 Conclusion
This chapter has outlined an analysis of valency-reducing verb extensions in Katcha,
making use of the Dynamic Syntax construal of terms as expressions of the epsilon
calculus. The inherent internal structure of epsilon terms allows a straightforward way
to incorporate context dependence into the account. An epsilon term represents an
arbitrary witness of some predicate and we can straightforwardly deﬁne this predicate
as being dependent on the immediate context. Thus it is straightforward to deﬁne
structures such as ‘Kuku is laughing (at whatever it is that Kuku is laughing at in this
instance)’ or ‘Drums are beaten (by whatever it is that beats drums)’.
In terms of the Katcha data, the approach outlined here allows us to neatly capture
the diﬀerence between (for example) an antipassive verb and a transitive verb with no
overt object. A transitive verb decorates its logical object node with a metavariable: a
term whose content is underspeciﬁed and requires subsequent update. In the case of
a transitive verb without an overt object, this update will come from context. In the
case of the antipassive, the update comes from the suﬃx, which supplies a contextually
deﬁned epsilon term. The same is true for the other suﬃxes which reduce semantic
valency, unaccusative and middle voice. Although the denotational content of the
epsilon term is minimal, it decorates the object node and so prevents it from being
instantiated from context by something with more substantive content. Thus ‘Kuku
is laughing’ is semantically diﬀerent to ‘Kuku is laughing at something’, despite the
same inherently transitive verb and an equally indeterminate ‘object’ being used in
both cases.12
The semantic diﬀerence between a transitive verb with an unspeciﬁed object and a
verb of reduced valency is not restricted to Katcha, nor to languages with morphological
antipassives. Fodor and Fodor (1980) note in regard to scope eﬀects that the same is
12The analysis as it currently stands has antipassives denoting some arbitrary patient, while the
pro-dropped object of a transitive verb must have a referential interpretation. It may be that this is
too strong. Intuitively, one might expect a transitive verb with no object to have the interpretation
I have ascribed to antipassives (there is some patient but we do not know or care what it is), and
for antipassives to be genuinely intransitive. Determining whether this is the case will require further
empirical study on the referentiality of pro-dropped arguments.",[197]
"9.5. Applicatives205the propositional structure. Since the indirect object of a ditransitive verb like aɗáŋŋá,
‘give’, is also marked with a, this is not an unreasonable conclusion. Case is discussedfurther in section 9.6.
A lexical analysis of applicative verbs is quite straightforward to implement in
Dynamic Syntax and in the case of Katcha there are possibly some morphophonological
arguments in favour of such an analysis. However, it is still worth considering whether
an analytic approach may be possible. Even if Katcha applicatives are lexical rather
than analytic, it is unlikely that applicatives are lexical in all languages, so a preliminary
sense of how applicative morphemes might contribute to the semantics of a proposition
is no bad thing. Indeed, considering any linguistic phenomenon from the point of view
of a novel theoretical framework might provide new insights that would otherwise be
missed.
One approach to providing an analytic characterisation of the applicative is that
presented by Marten (2002). Marten gives Swahili applicative verbs a lexical analysis
on the basis that ‘the applicative morpheme does not provide lexical access because it
does not constitute a phonological domain’ (Marten 2002:187), but he does give a sketch
of how an analytic construal of the applicative might proceed (Marten 2002:184-185).
His version of DS incorporates an underspeciﬁed semantic type e∗ . According to this
view, a verb projects a semantic predicate of the underspeciﬁed type e → (e∗ → t)),
allowing it to take any number of arguments. Furthermore, the predicate decorates an
unﬁxed node in the ﬁrst instance. The tree node address and the semantic type for
the verb are then resolved after all arguments have been processed. For ‘standard’ DS,
however, adding an additional argument after the verb has been parsed - if we assume
that this is the applicative’s function - would seem to constitute a major challenge to
the Dynamic Syntax framework.
An alternative approach would be to assume that the nominals licensed by applicatives should, on a semantic level, be analysed not as arguments of the verb but
as adjuncts. Languages with applicatives prototypically have semantically equivalent
non-applicative constructions where the peripheral arguments are marked as oblique
by means of, for example, adpositions. The alternation between the applicative construction and its adpositional equivalent generally conveys discourse-level or pragmatic
eﬀects (Peterson 2006:45-51; see also Marten 2002:192-198 for Swahili examples). As
such, in a framework like Dynamic Syntax where the only level of representation is
semantic, the parsing of an applicative construction and the equivalent adpositional
construction should ultimately derive the same logical form. The same analysis given
to prepositional phrases should also be given to applied objects.7
7In fact, this is exactly what Marten (2002) does, though from the other direction. Rather than
treating applicatives as adjuncts like prepositional phrases, prepositional phrases (and all ‘adjuncts’),
are treated as additional arguments.","[223, 224]"

others are more likely to agree with its semantic gender. He also notes that,

It seems that something like this is what is happening in (4.37). The subject agreement
marker in the same clause as the hybrid noun agrees with its syntactic gender (Masculine), while the subject agreement marker in the later clause agrees with its semantic
number (Plural).8
There is potential confusion in naming this gender class Plural and for practical
reasons it may be that an alternative name would ideally be found. Nonetheless,
thinking of this gender class as plural ﬁts the agreement facts of Katcha and is logical.
Assuming with Corbett (1991:8) that ‘there is always a semantic core to the assignment
system’, (in other words, gender classes always have a semantic basis), the ‘semantic
core’ of the third gender is clearly purality. To name this gender class Plural is merely
an extension of the same class-naming convention which grammarians have followed for
the last two millenia: there are three gender classes in Katcha; animate males generally
belong to the ﬁrst class so we may refer to it as Masculine; animate females generally
belong to the second class, so we may refer to it as Feminine; animate plurals generally
belong to the third class, so we may refer to it as Plural.
8It could be argued that masculinity is as salient a feature of a group of boys as plurality. I have
therefore stopped short of suggesting that in the case of laːlá, Plural is the word’s ‘semantic gender’,
though this would certainly ﬁt with Corbett’s hypothesis. It may be that the non-local agreement in
(4.37) is actually with number, rather than ‘semantic gender’. Nonetheless, it is clear that the local
agreement is with the word’s syntactic gender, while the more distant agreement is more semantically
based. In the case of i ́ːjá, ‘women’, whose syntactic gender is Plural, there is no such gender mis-match:
both local and non-local agreeing morphemes show plural agreement. It would be instructive to see
what happens in the case of a semantically singular noun with Plural syntactic gender, such as kanʈá,
‘spear’: local agreement is always with the syntactic gender (Plural) as expected, but I do not have
data on non-local agreement.","[80, 81]"
"9.6. Case markers213It always occurs at the left periphery of the clause, which often shows non-canonical
verbal morphology marking the verb either with inﬁnitive t- or, as here, the dependentclause marker ka. A detailed analysis of these sorts of discourse features is outwiththe scope of the current study, but whatever the analysis, it seems clear that nouns
marked with a are not treated by the syntax as canonical subjects. It may well be more
accurate to think of them as something like hanging topics.
The fact that this appears to be another case of a noun being marked by an a bringsup the intriguing possibility is that this subject-marking a and the dative a may in fact
be the same morpheme. That is, it may be possible to characterise the lexical actionsof dative a in a way that captures all three constructions in which a-marked nouns
occur. (9.43) sketches the immediate contexts of each of these with the relevant node
highlighted by the presence of the pointer: as the applied object of an applicative verb
(a), as the indirect object of a ditransitive verb (b), and preverbally as something like
a newly introduced topical subject (c).9

"9.1 Event-modifying prepositional phrases
(9.1) aːfʊ́ ʊ́rʊ́néːné k-etek-ɔːnaants 3m.crawl loc-1sg loc-body
‘ants are crawling on my body’
In a sentence like (9.1), it is not necessarily obvious whether the locative phrase ketekɔːna describes the location of the ants or the location of the event of their crawling. In
other words, this phrase might be thought of as modifying an individual or it might be
thought of as modiﬁying an event. From a formal point of view, this distinction does
not matter a great deal since both individuals and events project type e terms. A phrase
such as on my body can be thought of as supplying an additional proposition which is
‘intersective’ in that it shares an argument with the matrix proposition. Whether the
shared argument is an event term or an individual term does not make much diﬀerence
to the process of building the propositional tree.
In Dynamic Syntax, the formal tool used for modelling the connection between
propositions is the LINK relation. A LINK is the relation that holds between two
semantic trees which share some content. It is generally interpreted as a conjunction of
the values of the LINKed nodes. In the case of event-modifying prepositional phrases,
the LINK will hold between the situation argument of the matrix tree and the root
node of a LINKed tree that expresses an additional proposition about that situation.
This formal apparatus, a proposition LINKed to a term, is standardly used in DS
to model relative clauses. This is hardly surprising, given that a relative clause also
represents an additional proposition about some argument of the matrix proposition.
A PP adjunct modifying an argument is essentially a ‘small’ relative clause. To see how9.1. Event-modifying prepositional phrases183this might work, we can consider the process of parsing the sentence in (9.1), assuming
an interpretation where the prepositional phrase modiﬁes the event (though as noted
above, the implementation works in much the same way for an analysis in which the
PP modiﬁes the subject argument).
The processing of (9.1) begins with the parsing of the sentential subject and verb,
the lexical actions of the verb leaving the pointer on the situation argument node as in
(9.2).1,2

additional lexical material, the pointer would move to the logical subject node to resolve
the metavariable by unification with the unﬁxed node and the tree could compile
to give a fully speciﬁed proposition. But with the pointer at the event argument
node, there is nothing to stop this node being developed further. This can be done
using the computational action of LINK Introduction (Kempson et al. 2001:113;
Cann et al. 2005:88). This rule constructs a LINK relation from a type e node to
an open propositional node (a node with a requirement for type t). It also adds a
modal requirement ?⟨↓∗ ⟩(F o(si ), T y(es )), which requires that somewhere below (i.e. in
the LINKed tree) should be a copy of the node at the head of the LINK (9.3).
1The assumption that the lexical actions of the verb leave the pointer on the situation argument
node is an adjustment to the account given in chapter 8 where it was assumed that the lexical actions
of the verb left the pointer on the logical subject node. This does not aﬀect the analyses given there,
merely adding an additional step of pointer movement from the situation argument node to the logical
subject node.

Cann (In prep.) argues that, like other type e terms, event arguments should be construed as epsilon
terms. In the formulae given in this section the internal structure of terms, including event variables,
is suppressed for notational clarity. The interpretation of PP adjuncts given here is a non-restrictive
one and so does not need to make reference to the internal structure of the epsilon-term.","[201, 202]"
"Nonetheless it must be acknowledged that certain258Theoretical Analyses: Conclusionsinterpretations of the data come from approaching it with a dynamic mindset. Again,
the analysis of nominal modiﬁers is perhaps the clearest illustration of this.
In chapter 5 it is argued that the modiﬁers of nouns in Katcha are themselves
appositional nominals. This is an inherently dynamic view. Most traditional grammatical formalisms see syntax as a set of largely static relationships between words, and
therefore explain modiﬁcation in terms of hierarchical notions such as constituency.
In contrast, the analysis given here appeals not to a hierarchical relationship between
head and modiﬁer but to the incremental build-up of information during the parsing
process. One nominal (the ‘head’) is parsed, contributing semantic information to the
proposition under construction; a further nominal (the appositional ‘modiﬁer’) is then
parsed, contributing further semantic information.
The analysis of nominal modiﬁers also relies on a sharp distinction between lexical
NPs, which do not allow ‘internal’ modiﬁcation, and pronouns, which do allow such
modiﬁcation. Again, this distinction has its source in a dynamic approach. Central to
the dynamic perspective are the notions of underspeciﬁcation and subsequent update.
Anaphoric elements are seen as semantically underspeciﬁed, requiring some subsequent
update to make them interpretable. In contrast, lexical nouns have a fully speciﬁed
semantics and so provide signiﬁcantly less scope for any further speciﬁcation of their
interpretation. From this perspective, it is intuitive rather than surprising that there
should be a diﬀerence in the way pronouns and lexical NPs undergo modiﬁcation.
Approaching the data from a dynamic perspective thus opens up the possibility
of analysing modiﬁers as appositional nominals. This analysis provides what I believe
to be the best explanation of the facts of the Katcha data, incorporating the role of
the medial and distal demonstratives within the account of nominal modiﬁcation and
suggesting a connection between Katcha modiﬁers and the construct form found in
many African languages. These insights would in all likelihood have been missed if the
data had not been considered from a perspective whose underpinning presuppositions
are dynamic.
It has to be recognised then, that data is not described in a vacuum; the general
theoretical assumptions held by the researcher — any researcher — frame the questions
he or she asks and inﬂuence the descriptive analysis. In this study I have attempted
to present the morphosyntactic descriptions in a relatively atheoretical way but the
general assumptions underlying these descriptions come from a position which takes
incrementality and dynamic processes seriously. Adopting such assumptions brings a
particular perspective and yields particular insights in the morphosyntactic descriptions, which otherwise might be missed.","[276, 277]"
"7.3 Applicative
The applicative suﬃxes correspond to Stevenson’s ‘dative action’ (Stevenson 1941:112).
Stevenson gives only one suﬃx under this heading, -tV, and my data concurs with hisinsofar as the most common applicative suﬃx in my data is -tá (7.28b-7.29b). However,
some verbs take the suﬃx -nV̂, which appears to perform the same function (7.30b-7.31b). The distinction between -tá and -nV̂ would appear to be a lexical property of
the verb rather than any semantic property of the aﬃx.

object (where there is one). It is preceded by the dative preposition a, which marks
it as an oblique argument rather than a core argument of the verb. Assuming that
‘applicative’ is deﬁned as ‘a valence increasing operation that brings a peripheral participant onto center stage by making it into a direct object’ (Payne 1997:186, emphasis
mine), this means that the -tá/-nV̂ suﬃx does not strictly speaking mark applicative,
but dative. Its function is still to license the presence of an extra argument beyond
those required by the semantics of the verb (in contrast to ditransitive verbs such asanáŋːá ‘give’ which require no such suﬃx). But rather than licensing the presence of
a direct object, the suﬃx licenses the presence of a dative object. A further typical
feature of applicatives which is lacking in Katcha is an alternation between applicative
and non-applicative (eg adpositional) constructions. In Katcha there is no preposition
that can be used with non-applicative verbs to mark benefactive. The only way to
express a benefactive meaning is with the applicative construction. Languages do exist
where the use of applicative constructions are obligatory, but it is more prototypical
for applicatives to be optional (Peterson 2006:45-51). So this is another way in which
Katcha does not exhibit prototypical applicatives. Nonetheless, I retain the use of the
term ‘applicative’ for now since this is a widely used term for a morpheme on a verb
which licenses the presence of an extra argument. The diﬀerence in the Katcha case is
that the morpheme licenses an oblique, rather than core, argument.
The applicative form of a transitive verb does not appear to be aﬀected by the
presence or absence of an object. There is no diﬀerence between the morphology of the
verb in (7.31b), where the direct object is present and that in (7.32), where there is no
direct object.
(7.32) omuɗi uruɓú-nû
manakʊ́kkʊ3m.build-appl dat Kuku‘the man is building for Kuku’
One explanation of this is simply to note that as a ‘pro-drop’ language transitive
verbs in Katcha do not require an overt object. Thus it may be the form in (7.32)
is transitive, with an implied object; it would perhaps be better glossed as ‘the man
is building it/something for Kuku’. The existence of examples such as (7.32) does not
therefore preclude the existence of verbs which are both antipassive and applicative.
The fact there are no clearly attested examples may simply be a matter of frequency and
plausibility: the antipassive and the applicative are to some extent mutually exclusive.
The antipassive is used to express situations in which there is no theme or patient and
which are therefore quite general; the applicative is used to express situations in which
there is a goal or a beneﬁciary and which are therefore much more likely to involve
actions that are quite speciﬁc. It is not surprising that the two forms are seldom, if7.3. Applicative143ever, found together.
An alternative explanation is to note that there are two lexically-conditioned applicative suﬃxes, one of which displays vowel harmony with the root. As was speculated
for the antipassive, this may be an indication that applicative verbs are lexicalised. If
so, we would not expect to see an antipassive ‘suﬃx’ and an applicative ‘suﬃx’ on the
same verb: both form part of the stem and are in the same ‘slot’.
The idea that the applicative may be lexicalised is supported by the existence of
a couple of apparently irregular suﬃxes. The suﬃx -nVkV occurs with the verb ʊmʊ
‘hold’ (7.33).8 It is unclear whether this is an irregular applicative morpheme; it may be
a combination of Applicative -nV̂ with some additional morpheme. No other examples
of this suﬃx have been found.

b. omuɗi ʊmʊ-n k
mankanʈaakʊkkʊ3m.hold-appl k.o.spear ben Kuku‘the man is carrying a spear for Kuku’
Another apparently unique suﬃx is the -nɔta Applicative suﬃx which occurs only withthe verb ɪjɔ ‘wash’ (Tuna dialect) (7.34). In this case there is a plausible diachronicexplanation. In the larger ‘Katcha proper’ dialect, a diﬀerent verb is used: ɔkɔnɔ, whichtakes the regular -ta applicative suﬃx (7.35). It seems probable that the irregular suﬃx
in (7.34b) is a borrowing and reanalysis of the ﬁnal two syllables of the verb in (7.35b),
i.e. the ﬁnal syllable of the root used in the Katcha dialect area has been taken along
with the regular -tá suﬃx and reanalysed to create an irregular suﬃx.9

"80Morphosyntactic Descriptions: Nominal Modiﬁers5.4.2 Nominal modiﬁers as demonstrative pronouns — Morphosyntactic
evidence.
Having noted the evidence that já/má/ná and já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are phonologically conditioned
allomorphs, the question arises as to the nature of this morpheme. Based on the
morphosyntactic properties presented in sections 5.1-5.3, this section argues that it is
in fact the proximal demonstrative pronoun, acting as head of the modiﬁer phrase. A
possible alternative answer is that the já/mɔ́/nɔ́ morpheme is simply a general marker
of modiﬁcation. The latter suggestion does not ﬁt the Katcha data as well as the
analysis proposed here but it should be noted that the two analyses are related, and in
section 5.5.2 it is speculated that Katcha may be in the midst of a move from one to
the other.
It was demonstrated in sections 5.1-5.3 that demonstratives, possessive noun phrases
and relative clauses all display the same morphosyntactic properties with respect to
gender agreement, the modiﬁcation of peripheral arguments and pronominal use. Some
relevant examples are repeated below (5.36-5.44).4

The medial and distal demonstratives behave exactly like all other modiﬁers, except
that they do not take j-/m-/n- ‘preﬁxes’. This concurs with the evidence presentedin the preceding sections that j-/m-/n- are not preﬁxes which attach to modiﬁers,
but are themselves the modiﬁers. Moreover, the only nominal modiﬁers which arenot of the form já/mɔ́/nɔ́ are the medial and distal demonstratives. If the já/mɔ́/nɔ́
morpheme which introduces a possessive noun phrase or a relative clause is the proximal demonstrative, then there is a uniﬁed analysis which accounts for all examples:
nouns in Katcha may be modiﬁed only by demonstratives, or by phrases headed by
demonstratives.
As mentioned in section 5.1.2, there is evidence that demonstratives should be considered pronouns rather than determiners; in fact, there are no determiners in Katcha.
Since there are also no adjectives, Katcha has no modiﬁers that are unambiguously
internal to the noun phrase. This suggests that lexical nouns form complete noun
phrases and cannot be modiﬁed directly, from within the noun phrase. That is to say,
a noun phrase (in Minimalist terms, a DP) may be made up only of a noun. The
demonstrative is a pronoun which can be considered to stand in apposition with the
noun, taking its reference anaphorically. (5.2′ ) & (5.6c′ ) repeat some of the examples
given earlier, with an altered free translation which is more reﬂective of this analysis:

In the case of possessives and relative clauses, the same analysis can be put forward. The

pronoun (as suggested by Norton (2008b)), then this is entirely natural. One pronoun,
the demonstrative, has simply taken the place of another, the subject marker (5.18′ ):

Katcha using a construction parallel to that used for possessives. The relative clause
is non-ﬁnite or nominalised, as indicated by the dependent clause marker ka (and
also sometimes the inﬁnitive marker t-). Thus non-subject relatives can be seen asa ‘possessive’ relation holding between two ‘nominals’: the head noun, and the event
described by the relative clause. (5.21′ ) & (5.22b′ ) repeat examples given earlier, with
glosses and free translations more reﬂective of this analysis.

It should be noted that the morpheme at the end of a relative clause does not
quite ﬁt the analysis as explained here. It does not seem to be appositional to any
other nouns and does not take a t- preﬁx when within an oblique phrase. Both of
these facts follow from its position at the end of the clause in that it does not directly
follow the modiﬁed noun, and the t- preﬁx attaches to the clause-initial morpheme.
Note also that its status is somewhat unclear. Stevenson (1956-57:63-64) states that it
marks deﬁniteness, implying that it is optional. If this were true, the analysis should
be straightforward, conﬁrming the morpheme to be a demonstrative. On the other
hand, Gilley (2013:502) suggests that it is obligatory for masculine nouns, optional
for feminine, and unattested for plural, which would make the analysis somewhat
trickier. Neither of these descriptions quite match my data: the relative clause-ﬁnal
marker seems to be present fairly consistently. Interestingly though, in chapter 10
a Dynamic Syntax analysis of Katcha relative clauses is given which assumes the
clause-ﬁnal relative marker to be a demonstrative. On the basis of that assumption it
transpires that the role of the ﬁnal morpheme is to contribute deﬁniteness; in other
words, Stevenson is predicted to be correct.
The analysis that nominal modiﬁers comprise noun phrases in apposition, gets
some extra support from the wider tendencies of Katcha syntax, in that Katcha has a
tendency also to put verbs and clauses in apposition. Thus, while (5.49) is a perfectly
grammatical way of expressing the proposition ‘Kuku is a tall man’, (5.50) is equally
grammatical, and probably more common.","[98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]"

(9.32-9.33), an analytic approach would treat it as a two-place predicate with the
applicative morpheme signalling the presence of an adjunct (in DS terms, constructing
a LINKed tree).
The parsing of (9.31) under such an approach would begin with the parsing of the
subject and verb, leading to the tree in (9.34).

form, is not a grammatical utterance. The pointer therefore moves to the outstanding
node (9.37), requiring further lexical material to allow the parse to proceed.

"6.7. Conclusion1256.7 Conclusion
This chapter set out to describe the various forms of pronoun found in Katcha and to
explain the diﬀerences between them. Given the fact that the choice of pronominal
form is heavily dependent on the role it plays in the sentence and (in oblique cases)
which preposition it follows, an extended discussion of prepositions and similar morphemes was necessary before it was tentatively concluded that these diﬀerent forms
are realisations of case. Core cases (Nominative and Accusative) are assigned by verbs,
while prepositions assign Accusative or Oblique case to their pronominal complements.
The pronominal system once again reﬂects the importance in Katcha of the contrast
between the notions of ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’.10 There are two sets of pronouns, one of
which is used for the core arguments of subject and object while the other is used for
oblique arguments. For this reason, I have proposed referring to these sets of prononuns
as the core pronouns and the oblique pronouns respectively. Even if it is correct that
there is a distinction between the nominative and accusative cases, this still amounts
to a secondary diﬀerentiation within the category of core pronoun.
When we look at the interaction between the pronouns and prepositions it becomes
clear that these contrasting notions of core and non-core apply in other areas of the
language, and not just to argument structure. There are three types of prepositions:
those which take core pronouns as complements, those which take oblique pronouns as
complements and those which take a combination. The third group, which includes the
great majority of prepositions, is perhaps the most interesting because of the nature
of the combination of pronouns. The relevant factor in this case is whether or not
the preposition’s complement is a speech act participant. In 1st and 2nd person,
i.e. the core speech act participants, these prepositions take core pronouns as their
complements. In the 3rd person, i.e. non-speech act participants, the oblique pronouns
are used. In this way, there is a morphologically realised connection between the
notion of core arguments with regard to sentencial predicate-argument structure and
the notion of core participants with regard to speech act participation. The fact that
the pronouns used for subject and object (vis a vis oblique arguments) are also used for
speaker and hearer (vis a vis non-participants) gives further support to the idea that
the main diﬀerence between the two sets of pronouns is that of ‘core’ vs ‘peripheral’.","[143, 144]"

to be parsed is the proper noun Kuku the possessive set of lexical actions (the second
disjunct from the lexical entry in (10.26)) will be executed, constructing the ‘possessive’
predicate as well as the iota-structure as its object. Thus far the process is exactly as
for possessives, leading to the partial tree in (10.32).

indicates that the term currently under development does not make up the entirety of
the logical object, but is part of a larger entity. How the process unfolds to produce
a term representing ‘the event of Kuku seeing it’ is a matter of the internal structure10.5. Conclusion249of the relative clause so I leave it aside for the present, pending an analysis of clauses
with ka. For now it is suﬃcient to see how straightforwardly non-subject relatives may
be integrated into the overall analysis of nominal modiﬁers.1010.5 Conclusion
The analysis of Katcha nominal modiﬁers proposed in chapter 5 is that they are
uniformly ‘headed’ by demonstrative pronouns appositional to the noun phrase. This
is modelled in the Dynamic Syntax framework using a general computational rule
of Appositive LINK Introduction (10.4). This rule constructs a LINK relation
between two type e nodes which are decorated by epsilon terms projected by two noun
phrases, namely the modiﬁed NP (a lexical noun) and the modiﬁer ‘headed’ by a
demonstrative pronoun. The corresponding evaluation rule (10.9) merges the two into
a single epsilon term with a conjoined restrictor. Thus the properties projected by two
noun phrases in apposition can only be interpreted as holding of a single individual.
The analysis of demonstrative pronouns presented here extends the actions associated with them to include the construction of more semantic structure than is
standard in Dynamic Syntax. Pronouns are seen not only to be placeholders but also
to build partial epsilon structures. Speciﬁcally, they project an argument variable and
an epsilon binder, but no restrictor. The restrictor may be provided by substitution
of a referent from context, in which case the demonstrative has a deﬁnite, pronominal
interpretation (section 10.1). Alternatively, it may be provided by a verb, in which
case the demonstrative essentially acts as a relative pronoun (section 10.2). Another
possibility is that the restrictor’s value is constructed from some contextually provided
value expressing some relationship, such as possession, between the argument variable
and some other term (section 10.3). These possibilities directly model the analysis of
chapter 5 where it was argued that the interpretation of a demonstrative pronoun is
dependent on what follows in the rest of the modiﬁer phrase.
The fact that the demonstrative pronoun projects an internal argument node and
decorates it with a variable restricts how the metavariable can be updated by substitution and means that the analysis predicts certain correlations which do not necesarily
seem to be related at ﬁrst. For example, the analysis predicts correctly that only
subjects can be relativised directly. Similarly, the predicate of possession is forced to
have as its logical subject the possessee rather than the possessor, which reﬂects the
10An alternative approach would be to assume that the relative clause provides context to enrich
some semantically weak predicate (possibly a metavariable) which holds of the head noun. In this
case the dependent clause marker presumably marks the fact that the verb does not predicate over
the nominal variable but has some other relation to it. Again, a full analysis will need to wait until
the DCM has been studied more carefully. If this were the correct analysis, it would be likely to have
implications for the present account of the semantically weak predicate P OSSD.","[266, 267, 268]"

"4.1. Number37exactly how this is done. Where there is no evidence to the contrary, my default is to
assume a transparent analytic morphology for multimorphemic words on the basis that
this best satisﬁes Occam’s razor.2 For this reason the descriptive analyses in part II
largely focus on establishing the function of individual morphemes and the theoretical
analyses in part III on deﬁning their formal semantics. I assume that evidence in
favour of taking an alternative, more lexical position in any particular case will largely
come from morphophonology (Kaye 1989, 1995). Since this study has little to say
on phonology, I remain open minded about the best morphological analysis in any
given instance and in places I consider analyses based on an alternative morphological
characterisation.3,44.1 Number
Number is marked on Katcha nouns by plurative and singulative aﬃxes. Most of
these are preﬁxes, and they are relatively numerous. In some cases, singulative and
plurative preﬁxes occur in pairs, and in a subset of these, it is possible to see a semantic
connection between the nouns they inﬂect. In this way, Katcha nouns superﬁcially
resemble Kordofanian nouns with their noun-class preﬁxes and Stevenson (1941, 195657) frames his presentation of nouns in these terms. Stevenson does note two important
caveats: ﬁrstly, that the agreement system in Katcha is quite diﬀerent to those found
in the Kordofanian languages (this is discussed in section 4.2), and secondly, that ‘most
of the noun classes possess either a singular or a plural preﬁx, but not both’ (Stevenson
1941:26).
More recent work (Dimmendaal 2000; Gilley 2013) has argued that Katcha displays
a system more typical of Nilo-Saharan nouns: a tripartite system consisting of ‘singulative marking, plural marking, and a replacement pattern’ (Dimmendaal 2000:214).
That is to say, there are nouns whose plural form is unmarked and whose singular is
marked morphologically; there are nouns where the unmarked form is the singular and
it is the plural form which is morphologically marked; ﬁnally, there are nouns where
both singular and plural carry morphological inﬂection. Diverging from Dimmendaal’s
terminology slightly, I refer to morphology of the ﬁrst type as singulative, to the second
type as plurative and to the third type as replacive. To avoid ambiguity, when referring
to the number of the referent, I use the terms semantically singular or semantically
plural.
2We need a syntax to combine linguistic units anyway, so all things being equal we may as well use
it rather than have a separate set of morphological operations.
3
For example, see the discussion in section 9.5 of whether verbs carrying an applicative suﬃx should
be analysed as lexical items or analytically.
4
The approach to morphology summarized here is in line with the general assumptions of Dynamic
Syntax. DS takes linguistic formatives as projecting semantic instructions to the computation, but is
not exercised about whether those formatives are words or morphemes.","[55, 56]"

The lexical actions associated with the unaccusative directly correlate with those
of the antipassive. The diﬀerence of course, is that unaccusative constructions are
‘agentless’ rather than ‘patientless’, that is, the unaccusative decorates the logical
subject node rather than the logical object node with a value indicating an individual
which is indeﬁnite, arbitrary and context-dependent.
In processing a sentence such as (8.35), after parsing the subject and verb, we have
the partial tree in (8.36), with a type e term projected by the subject decorating an
unﬁxed node, and the pointer sitting on the logical subject node:8.4. Unaccusative169(8.36) Parsing ambá mabʊ
