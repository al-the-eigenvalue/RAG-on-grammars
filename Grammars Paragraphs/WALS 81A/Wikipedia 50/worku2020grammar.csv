Note that the semantics role of the post-verbal nɔ̀ŋ in (10.20a and b) are different, where
the free pronoun nɔ̀ŋ in (10.22a) is due to speaker’s occasional use when referring to
kinship nouns without optional modifying possessive pronouns. Or otherwise there may
be similar constructions with (b) ʤɔ̀ɔ̀nɛ̀-á n=ɛ̀nɛ̀ <mother-RSTR SG.PSD=3SG.PSR> ‘his
mother’ or simply a pertensive form ʤɔ̀ɔ̀nɛ̀. Such occurrence of free pronouns in the
expression of possession with kinship nouns seems to be common in languages that
have no grammatical gender. So nɔ̀ŋ in (a) is part of the indirect object/dative
construction, or it is within the role of the semantic recipient. On the other hand, nɔ̀ŋ in
(10.22b) is a direct object or it is a semantic theme.
The other interesting point seems to be regarding the coding of core arguments on
ditransitive verbs, in which ditransitive verbs themselves divide into two types. Mursi
ditransitive verbs are: áʤ ‘give’ jóg ‘tell’ and ɗól ‘show, announce’. Despite the fact
that languages employ different strategies for these verbs (cf. Dixon 1994: 120), all of
them have three core roles in Mursi. The ditransitive áʤ ‘give’. ― (i) The bound object
pronominal form of the recipient (if human recipient) is cross-referenced on the verb
and the gift as peripheral argument without being coded by postposition or case markers
(e.g. 10.19). (ii) The bound object pronominal form of the gift/theme (human
patient/affected) is cross-referenced on the verb following differential object marking
while the recipient is placed as peripheral argument coded by no overt postposition or
case marker (e.g. 10.20a-b). (iii) Only the subject in A function (the agent role) is cross467referenced on the verb while the gift is placed in O function and the recipient (if human)
is placed as peripheral argument by suffixing a motion towards marker (dative) on the
verb (e.g. 10.22a-b). The verb áʤ does not take a benefactive suffix like the other two
ditransitive verbs. Moreover, it undergoes a three term root suppletion for aspect while
jóg and ɗól do not alter their roots for aspectual distinction. When two semantic roles
of the O arguments follow this verb, free ordering is possible as long as the recipient is
human, as in (10.23a-b).

On the other hand, the ditransitive verbs jog (with core roles ‘message’ and

take both motion towards and benefactive suffixes to encode either or both O

With respect to the stability of mono-transitive and ditransitive clauses in the canonical

3.SBJV-go-3sg.SU10.2.2 Non-canonical OVA/VS
The non-canonical constituent order OVA/VS is the sole order that brings an overt case
marking scenario to the language, i.e. the marked-nominative. Cross-linguistically,
marked-nominative is a rare case system mainly found in African languages. König
(2008: 138) reported that marked-nominative case system are an almost unique African
469phenomenon, which is only attested in few languages outside Africa. A commonly
known scenario in a marked-nominative system is to treat/mark S and A the same way
and treating the O differently. Whatsoever is the constituent order it occurs in, the O is
in no way morphologically marked. The O always has the same form (citation/basic
form). Straighwardly, the marked-nominative case system of Mursi operates based on
an OVA/VS constituent order. Thus post-verbal subjects in this constituent order are
morphologically and formally marked by marked-nominative case suffixes.
Since this section is about the case system of the language, I prefer to mention two
terms from de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 567) who also outlined two basic functions
of case marking ― identifying function and distinguishing function. Accordingly, the
identifying function of case encodes internal properties of the arguments, whereas the
distinguishing function of case encodes and depends on the relation between the
arguments. The former is used more in case morphology to encode specific
semantic/pragmatic information about the nominal argument in question (p.567ff.). For
example, the noun with nominative case in (10.26) is an agent [+control, +volitional,
etc.].

man-NOMAs de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 568) put it: ‘‘the distinguishing strategy is a more
specific strategy that is used for distinguishing between the two core arguments of a
transitive clause, that is, the subject and the object’’. Example (10.26) above is a
transitive clause thus it has two core arguments. Therefore, case has marked one of the
arguments, the post-verbal subject is case-marked to avoid argument ambiguity. If the
two arguments are already cross-referenced on the verb, one may of course ask why is
the case marking in (10.26) important. The simplest answer is; what if the object470argument in (10.26) is a noun or third person pronoun? This is due to the fact that when
the object equals the subject in animacy and defineteness (as in (10.27), then the
nominative case becomes the only way to distinguish the actual subject.

10.1Grammatical RelationsIntroductionGrammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. According to
(König, 2006:657f.; Dixon 1994:63ff), Mursi is a multilayered language in that it
utilizes a constituent order AVO/SV (neither the A nor the S arguments can be
unmarked for nominative case) and the OVA/VS order in which post-verbal A and S
arguments are for marked-nominative case. However, case-marking is often employed
depending on the constituent order system of the language. Mursi is a nominativeaccusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is also a head-marking
language that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to indicate grammatical
relations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference markings on the verb
which predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This operates by indexing bound
pronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In clauses with ditransitive verbs,
argument indexing on the verb often operates according to referential prominence scale
hierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint principles.
There is no single rigid and imperative approach of analyzing the relations of
constituents within individual languages from multiple but plausible morphogical,
syntactic and semantic approaches. This is often possible, however, if and only if the
analysis make sense for a particular instance such as to indicate relation of constituents
within a clause. And above all, if the analysis conforms to the basic grammatical
properties of the language under description. While the treatement of case marking
strategy in Mursi largely depends on syntax, the discourse prominence of arguments
such as animacy and definiteness are indispensable tools that enable us to understand
the way in which pronouns and nouns function in clauses.
453For example, free pronouns in the S or A function of the canonical constituent order
SV/AVO will in no way be marked for case, nor will it trigger any morphological
markings which may indicate the relation of constituents in a clause, whereas in a noncanonical OVA/VS constituent order, pronouns in S/A are marked for nominative case,
thus now encode further pragmatic function, i.e. focus/topic. For example, in a copular
clause, the first person plural pronoun in CS function precedes the copula verb, as is
always the case in the canonical order ―àggè kánó ‘We (exc.) are’. Or to turn this into
a question clause, the copula verb should be moved to a clause initial position, i.e. kánó
àggè? ‘Are we?’. But, to put the focus on the CS, the same pronoun but in nominative
case form will be inserted between the copular verb and the unmarked form pronoun,
as in (10.1).
(10.1)k-án-ó
1SU-COP.IMPERV-1pl.EXC.SU
‘Who are we?’àggè-ò
1pl-NOMàggè?
1plSince the copula verb is now at clause initial position, the marked-nominative pronoun
is in line with the principle of ‘‘case after the verb’’, in contrast to ‘‘no case before the
verb’’.
For what appear to be due to the morphosyntactic and pragmatic interaction of
constituents in the non-canonical order, post-verbally Mursi nominals in markednominative case form can often function as either topical-S or topical-A.
In this chapter, among many, are two major topics which have been discussed in
detail, each of them are typologically rare and could perhaps be typical features of
Mursi. These are Noun Modification Construction and marked-nominative case. The
noun modification construction system of Mursi is the bearer of genitive case, whereas
the locus of marked-nominative case and other grammatical cases that mark both core
and non-core constituents is in the canonical and non-canonical constituent orders. Thus
454this chapter of grammatical relations shall present various morphosyntactic topics
which particularly deals with constituent order (§10.2), case marking (§10.3),
postpositions (§10.4), and verb-final suffix (§10.5).
10.2 Constituent order
Mursi has three types of constituent order: canonical AVO/SV, non-canonical OVA/VS
where the A/S is marked with morphological marked-nominative case suffixes, and
non-canonical OAV (a somewhat a strict constituent order of negation). With respect
to grammatical relations, each is dealt with in subsequent sub-sections below.","[475, 476, 477, 478]"

hózò‘hunger’Mursi nouns can be grouped into three types based on how they mark the nominative
case. The three types stated below are based on the way singular nouns behave in
relation to the nominative case. Nouns in the plural form take the invariable
nominative suffix -u.
(i)Type I ― nouns that take the nominative case suffix -o (singular) and -u
(plural),(ii)Type II ― nouns that take the nominative suffix -j (singular) and
-u (plural), and(iii) Type III ― nouns that mark/indicate nominative case by final segment reduction.
For instance, mɛ̀dɛ̀rɛ̀/mɛ̀dɛ́r ‘sheep/sheep.NOM’, rɔ̀sɔ̀/rɔ̀s ‘dog/dog.NOM’, tɔ̀ŋɔ̀/tɔŋ
‘goat/goat.NOM’, gùʃùrɔ́/gùʃùr ‘hyena/hyena.NOM’ and so on. The segment which
is often reduced from noun roots is the vowel -ɔ, in most cases from nouns that477end in this vowel. The case of -ɛ reduction from the animate noun mɛ̀dɛ̀rɛ̀ may be
taken as an exceptional case, if this is the only instance, but we can't be sure at
this stage. See the examples given below:

its argument would also being cross-referenced on the verb. In the non-canonical
constituent order (VS/OVA), also an order which enables both intransitive and
transitive subjects be topical/focal, constituents are marked by nominative case.
However, unlike human subjects, non-human post-verbal subjects are subject to
segment reduction, usually for nouns that end in -ɔ. Previous knowledge of the478language's constituent ordering system might help, otherwise it would be difficult to
distinguish the subject from the object in clauses such as (10.35a).

In (10.35a), it is the constituent word order that identifies the two arguments which
otherwise are almost identical and both arguments can equally share the same bound
pronominal suffix which is cross-referenced on the verb. In (10.35b), it is the
nominative case that identifies both arguments that come with strict ordering of the
post-verbal S/A argument.
Nouns that take nominative case morphology may also occur independent of the
strict ordering of post-verbal S/A. In this case, they may occur in NPs that are topical
as well as focal within a clause, as in (10.36).

Even non-animate nouns can behave like subjects as long as they are taking the
nominative case. As can be shown in (10.38), hózò ‘hunger’ is the agent while the first479person object pronominal suffix attached to the verb is the object. It can literally mean
‘I am hit by hunger’.

10.2.3 The non-canonical order (AOV)
The third and the strictest constituent order in the language is AOV. In an AOV order,
due to strict orders of constituents, where negated verbs need to be moved to a clause
final positions, arguments in A function are often forced to appear at clause-initial
position. Unless in few exceptional constructions, this applies to all negated verbs
regardless of the type of clauses or moods in which they belong.

As shown in above negative declarative clauses, both A and O arguments precede the
verbal predicate. Note that in the negative perfective aspect, the third person S/A
argument is marked on the verb as subjunctive marker in the same way as first person480subjects, i.e. k(V)-. The second persons are marked differently from first and third
person subjects, so they do not make use of the k(V)- prefix (as in (10.41)).

Furthermore, the position the O argument in AOV ordered clauses may vary when it is
a pronoun and when it is a simple or common noun. When the O argument is a pronoun,
it has been observed that there is a tendency for the O argument to follow the verb
regardless of the aspect and transitivity (transitive and ditransitive) value of the verb.

As it is shown in (10.42a-c), all arguments in O function are pronouns, for which at first
ORc2.glance it appears to be the case that this applies when the O argument is a pronoun. But,
the second option in (10.42c1) shows that the O argument can also be between the
perfective negative particle ŋànì and the negated verb. In other word, the O argument
now comes in its typical AOV order. From argument structuring point of view, the O
arguments can be optional constituents as long as they are indexed as pronominal forms
on the verb. Otherwise in clauses such as (10.42c2), they can be very ambiguous
especially when the A equals O both in person and number.","[499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504]"
"456Thus, apart from those mentioned in (i-iii), all bound pronominal suffixes that crossreference S/A and O arguments have a non-zero realizations.
In AVO constituent order, whenever the subject occurs before the verb (pre-verbal),
both the subject and the object that follows the verb are treated as an unmarked
nominative and unmarked accusative case. By an unmarked case, we mean
morphologically and functionally unmarked, as shown below in (10.3a-d).

In (10.3c), since oblique case does not mark core argument, it is easy to know the direct
object. The O NP in (10.3d) does not take any marking in relation to accusative case.
As a head-marking language, syntactic function of core arguments can be shown by
cross-referencing bound pronominal suffixes on the verb. As can be shown in (10.3ad), a bound pronominal suffix of one core argument is being cross-referenced on the
predicate, i.e. A. This is due to the fact that the referential status of the O NPs in (10.3ad) are common nouns. So when compared to first/second or even to third person
pronouns, it is natural to see common nouns in O function rather than in A (Dixon 1994:
85). Mursi is a language that has a strict rule of ‘no case before the verb’ (König
2008:247). Although core constituents occur in S, A or O syntactic function in SV/AVO
order, no change will occur with respect to case marking.","[479, 480]"

There is however a difference when first and second person free pronouns are used in
O function. First and second person singular free pronouns are more definite than third
person pronoun singular, which is also used as a dummy/impersonal pronoun. At the
same time, first and second person free pronouns have bound pronominal suffixes
which look like shortened forms of these free pronouns. Moreover, Dixon (1994: 95)
noted that there is a tendency for cross-referencing systems to be normally pronominal,
which have developed from free-form pronouns at some early stage of the language.
This seems to be true for Mursi, for which the first and second person singular bound
pronominal object suffixes -áɲ [-óɲ] <1sg.OBJ> and -iɲ <2sg.OBJ> appear to have
evolved from àɲè ‘I/me’ and ìɲè ‘you (sg.)’. Note that both the third person free
pronouns have no such bound pronominal morphological suffixes to cross-reference
third person O arguments on the verb.
When first and second person pronouns are in O function in AVO order, as can be
seen in the examples given below, bound pronominal O and A argument markers are
attached to the verb. When both subject and object bound pronominal suffixes occur in
a transitive clause, the object pronominal suffix always precedes the subject pronominal
suffix.

In (10.6a), only the perfective bound pronominal suffix -a for the third person A
argument is cross-referenced on the verb while no bound pronominal marking for the
third person O argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Since there is no
morphologically bound pronominal marking for the third arguments in O function, the
constituent order we see in (10.6b) could be unusual with respect to O slots in negated
clauses. Mursi has the non-canonical AOV/SV constituent order for negative clauses,
as it is shown in (10.7).

But, due to the absence of a bound pronominal O argument marking morphological

way as a clause in the AVO constituent order.
Furthermore, the fact is that most interrogative words in Mursi are pronominal (10.8a)
or pro-phrasal (10.8b). They often occur at clause final slot of the AVO canonical
order― in O function.","[480, 481, 482]"

As is shown in (1.5b), in an AOV order, due to strict orders of constituents, negated
verbs need to be moved to a clause final positions, and arguments in A/S function are
often forced to appear at clause-initial position. In (1.6a-b), the nominative case system
of Mursi operates based on an OVA/VS constituent order. Thus post-verbal subjects in
this constituent order are morphologically and formally marked by marked-nominative
case suffix -o, for a transitive post-verbal subject argument marker (A) (as in (1.6a-b)
Mursi marks both the head noun and the dependent form. There are morphological
markers for the head noun and for the dependent (modifier) called ‘restrictive and nonrestrictive modification’ form. As a head and dependent marking language, all
dependents or modifiers, except number words and quantifiers are required to indicate
their dependency relation with the head nouns they modify always by an overt
morphological inflection: -a (for restrictive) and -i [-ti] (for non-restrictive). This
dependency phenomenon between head nouns and dependents is widely known as
'Construct-Form' (CF) by some Semitists. In Semitic languages this phenomenon is also
known by a different term ― ‘construct state’. In fact, other terms are also used: ‘status
constructus’ (Tucker and Bryan 1966), ‘modified noun form’ (Reh 1996), and
‘construct form’ (Creissels 2006). In Mursi, both the head noun and the dependent can
be marked by the same dependency modification markers: HEAD.NOUN-a DEPENDENT
11(MODIFIER)-a (restrictive) or HEAD.NOUN-i [-ti] DEPENDENT (MODIFIER) (-i [-ti])
(nonrestrictive).
In Mursi, within NPs, head nouns are obligatorily marked by restrictive (as in (1.7))
and nonrestrictive (as in (1.8-1.9) forms because head nouns are required to fulfill the
role of head nouns on the basis of internal structure of NPs.

The underived adjective bú functions as an intensifier, not as a modifier. Thus the
(1.8)relationship of the head is directly with the quantifier, i.e. mɛ̀rì. However, within a
similar NP construction, if bu functions as quantifier, any other modifier following it
may not be marked by a nonrestrictive modification marker, as in (1.10).

In this grammar, as far as this marking is concerned, instead of the term constructform, I prefer to call it ‘modification marker’ (see details of it in Chapter 4).
The same noun modification markers apply in possessive constructions when
indicating possession/ownership in light of the head and/or possessed (D) and the12dependent and/or possessor (R) dependency relationship within the syntactic frame of
‘NP-internal possessive construction’. Accordingly, Mursi has five NP-internal
possessive construction types: one structure where R (the possessor) and D (the
possessed human/animate/inanimate item/object are simply juxtaposed within NP ―
and four other distinct structures where D is followed by R. A possessive relationship
that can be expressed by a juxtaposed possessor and possessed is very different from
all other possessive relationship construction types. Morphologically, both possessor
and possessed nouns do not take any markers. This means that, the possessed item is
not marked by ‘restrictive/nonrestrictive modification or ‘relator suffix -a. The same is
true for the possessor, which does not take any marker including the genitive case, for
example, híríR sáràD <man.SGname.PL> ‘The man’s name’. There is no marking oneither the possessor or the possessed. The noun sárá ‘name’ is an inherently plural noun
in Mursi and has no singular counterpart, but the meaning hasn't been affected and still
has a singular interpretation. The remaining four types of possessive constructions
within an NP involve POSSESSED(D)-a R{where the R is a POSSESSOR-GEN (as in (1.11)
or a POSSESSIVE PRONOUN (1.12) or a PERTENSIVE MARKER (1.13)).

As we can see in the examples shown above, the modification marker or the relator
suffix attached to D should always be identical. The fifth type of ‘NP-internal
possessive construction’ in Mursi is called ‘Noun modification construction’ (NMC).
It is normally the same as with the three NP construction types mentioned earlier, i.e. a
13structure where D is followed by R. Yet it stands apart from all previously mentioned
possessive construction types because it may involve a series of intermediate possessors
(Rs)/modifiers. Therefore the D and the intermediate R’s are marked by restrictive
modification marker/relator marker -a while the real possessor is marked by the
genitive case marker. The restrictive modification marker/relator marker -a is marked
on both NP constituents (the possessed/head noun and on the intermediate
possessors/modifiers) (see more in Chapter 4). Welmers (1973) used the term
‘associative construction’ in reference to nouns which express a wide range of semantic
relationships with other nouns occurring as modifiers within the same NP. See the
following examples.

How aspect is shown in Mursi has been mentioned earlier, so here I focus on mood
category. The mood category of Mursi includes imperative, hortative, jussive, reality,
and subjunctive. All are expressed by inflectional markings on the verbs. Only the
hortative and the jussive moods can be marked by an optional morphological particle
aj/aɲ. In Mursi, the imperative mood refers to a command given to an addressee (the
second person). The verb utilized in the positive imperative construction must always
occur in the perfective aspect. The negative imperative construction utilizes a verb in
the imperfective aspect. However, in both constructions number can be marked on the14verb. The plural suffix -V is marked on the verb to denote plural addressee while the
bare perfective verb root in its own indicates singular addressee. Person of the subject
is unmarked. Verb-final suffixes -a (for singular), -ɛ (for plural) and a variant of both,
-o can be added to a clause-finally occurring verbs of the imperative constructions.

Unlike the positive imperative, the negative imperative utilizes an imperfective verb
root and different number suffixes ― despite both being commands used to deliver a
speaker's intent that a certain course of action must be carried out within a specified
period of time. The negative imperative utilizes the imperfective negative proclitic ŋà=,
imperfective verb root, and two invariable number suffixes -i (for singular addressee)
and -o (for plural addressee). See the examples below.

The hortative and the jussive in Mursi are non-canonical imperative moods directed
to first and third persons and can be used to denote a mild command. Like the canonical
imperative, positive hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the perfective aspect
for positive whereas negative hortative and jussive moods utilize a verb in the
imperfective aspect. An interesting prosodic feature here is that a grammatical tone will
be used to distinguish between the hortative and the jussive form. The hortative mood15takes a low-toned prefix hortative k(V̀ )- and a low-toned verb root. It may optionally be
preceded by a free form high-toned hortative particle áj [áɲ] (as in (1.22).

The jussive mood refers to a command directed at the third person. The jussive mood
marker prefix k(V)- and the verb always carry a low-toned melody. Besides, the jussive
marker prefix (k(V)-) will not be marked when the negated form is used (as in (1.25c)).

Subjunctive is one of the three moods in Mursi which are expressed by the irrealis(1.25)morphological marker within the perfective aspect. Subjunctive, like the other two
irrealis moods (hortative and jussive), utilizes a prefix k(V)- and a perfective verb root.
(The details await us in Chapter 7.)
Adjectives are one of the three open word classes of Mursi. Adjectives are open
classes by derivation. Based on the morphological properties they display, Mursi
adjectives can be divided into two major categories: underived (tííní ‘small’ and bùì
‘big’) and derived (Type I― mainly from stative verbs; Type II ― derived from stative16verbs and from other word classes through productive and unproductive morphological
derivations). The two underived adjectives display sound iconicity. This phenomenon
is an association between sound and meaning. Dixon (2010:69) pointed out that a high
front vowel i is often naturally associated with a little/small object and a high back
vowel u with a big/large one. Adjectives always bear the general adjectiviser suffix -i,
regardless of each adjective's morphological property. Syntactically, adjectives can
modify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive predicate slot (as in (1.26)),
fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in comparative
constructions, and function as manner modifiers. The adjective class of Mursi covers
all semantic types that can be conveyed by adjectives.

Reduplication is the only way of marking number on underived adjectives (as in
(1.27 and 1.28)). Only the underived adjective can take degree of magnitude markers:
free form gòɗé (gèɗé) (diminutive ‘very small’) and the suffix -sís (augmentative ‘very
big’).

As Mursi is a free-constituent order language, the order among adjectives within NPs
and in sentences is relatively free. As to the ordering of adjectives within NPs,
throughout the adjective chapter and this grammar, no more than two adjectival
modifiers are available. The details of adjectives are the topic of Chapter 8.
Mursi has four valency decreasing and four valency increasing derivations. The
valency decreasing derivations are passive, antipassive, reciprocal, and reflexive.
17Benefactive, applicative/comitative, causative, and directional/motion increase the
number of core arguments. Each valency changing derivations may employ more than
one strategies, for example, the reciprocal derivation has four different possibilities
while reflexive derivation has at least two possibilities (these are topics that have been
discussed in detail in Chapter 9).
Grammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. However,
case-marking is often employed depending on constituent order system of the language.
Mursi is a nominative-accusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is
also a head-marking language that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to
indicate grammatical relations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference
markings on the verb which predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This
operates by indexing bound pronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In
ditransitive clause constructions, argument indexing on the verb often operates
according to referential prominence scale hierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint
principles (see more on grammatical relations in Chapter 10).
Mursi has sophisticated and elaborate comparative construction techniques.
Comparative constructions explicitly indicate participants being compared and
parameter of comparison (often adjectives). Index of comparison may be indicated by
attaching a benefactive/dative marker suffix to the element of the parameter of
comparison, i.e. ‘comparative-benefactive’. Mursi has a total of seven types of
comparative constructions: mono-clausal, phrasal plus mono-clausal, bi-clausal (are of
two type TYPE I and TYPE II), connector ɓá ‘place’, hɛ́kó…tɛ̀b ‘same…as’/hɛ́tɔ́…tɛ̀b
‘be.same…as’ (‘as…as’), and one additional strategy. (Chapter 11 offers more
interesting details on comparative constructions.)18Mursi has both question types: content questions and polar questions. Content
question words (mostly pronominals) usually occupy clause final argument slots. As a
language with an AVO canonical order of constituents, all Mursi question words occur
immediately following the verb, i.e. a syntactic position available for grammatical
objects. Moreover, sentence-final positions, syntactic slots for core and non-core
arguments, may typically function as focus-bearing positions when filled by question
words. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raising
the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing noninterrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement (see details in Chapter 12).
Typologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. In
Mursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbal
constituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories such
as aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect can
be negated by bound circumclitics whereas a verb in the perfective aspect is negated by
independent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus by
negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. Interestingly, negative
declarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV, constituent order, for which negated
verbs always occupy clause-final positions. This is a syntactic phenomenon that works
only for order of negated predicates in negative clauses, which is different from the
affirmative clauses in a canonical constituent order SV/AVO and from clauses having
a marked-nominative and case marked S/A subjects OVA (in a transitive clause) VS (in
an intransitive clause). Many more interesting features of the negation system are
discussed in Chapter 13.
Mursi has the following main clause types: conditional, temporal, speech report
clause, complement clause, copular clause, and obligation/deontic clause. Each clause19type may utilizes one or more varieties of clause combining/linking strategies. In Mursi,
clauses can be combined or linked by the following four major clause combining
techniques: subordination, complementization, relativisation, and coordination. For
instance, a speech report clause in Mursi is introduced by the quotative marker ké
<QUOT> ‘that’. It always precedes the speech verbs such as élí 'call' and sé 'say'; but it
may precede or follow the speech report. ké also functions as complementizer, so the
term ‘quotative-complementizer’ would best explains it.
In some circumstances, it is important to take into account that certain clause types
may follow strict subordination rules. Thus, for instance, a conditional clause
construction must contain the conditional particle hùllì ‘if, when’, which almost always
occurs at the beginning of the subordinate clause; whereas a constituent that occurs at
the subordinate clause-final position is being marked by the subordinate clause marker
enclitic =jè [=è] (as in (1.29)).

"10.2.1 Canonical order (AVO/SV)
In a canonical constituent order AVO/SV, A precedes the verb and O follows it.
AVO/SV is by far the most frequently found constituent order in Mursi clauses uttered
in isolation. Thus, non-case involving grammatical relations of the A and the O in
transitive clauses are marked by this constituent order. In canonical order, both
nominative and accusative cases are not marked morphologicaly and formally. The
subject position may be filled by any NP in citation form.

Interestingly, as can be shown in (10.2a), the verb-final suffix -ɔ̀ is the morphological
marker that shows the canonicity of this constituent order and is often added to an
intransitive verbs in the imperfective aspect. However, this suffix is absent when the
verb is in the perfective aspect or when manner modifiers and oblique arguments follow
the intransitive imperfective verb ― compare the examples given below (10.2c-e).

Mursi marks both S and A in the same way on the verb. Like the S of an intransitive
clause, any NP constituent can be in A position. The fact is that pronouns, proper nouns
or common nouns in both A and O functions normally occur in citation form in the
AVO constituent order. But, with regard to constituents that can fill the O position,
there are at least certain distinctions between pronouns and proper/common nouns.
But before we go into these details, there are three crucial points that we should take
into consideration when cross-referencing bound pronominal (A and O) arguments on
verbs.
(i)The first person plural inclusive and third person singular bound pronominal A
argument markers have zero suffix realizations on verbs in the imperfective
aspect.(ii)The third person singular and plural bound pronominal O argument markers have
always zero suffix realizations on verbs in imperfective and perfective aspects,(iii) When the bound pronominal of the A arguments from (i) and bound pronominal
of the O argument from (ii) co-occur on a verb, they are marked by no (two zero)
suffixes.
By giving these clarifying notes of the bound pronominal (A, O) argument markers, we
now shall see how arguments in the monotransitive clause of the AVO constituent order
are marked.","[478, 479]"

We recall that the syntactic position of negated verbs within negated clauses are clause
final. But in (9.51), the predicate, which is marked by the applicative comitative
derivational suffix -čo, has to occur in a canonical constituent order, i.e. preceeding the
applicative argument in O function (màìgùá gùj ‘your (pl.) husbands’). Likewise,
question clauses containing derived applicative arguments will always follow the
canonical constituent order, as in (9.51).

A prototypical derived applicative clause in Mursi involves a subject argument of a

and the original object argument of the underlying transitive clause (O).

"1.2Linguistic profile of MursiThe linguistic typological profile of Mursi is similar to a certain degree to the Surmic
group languages, particularly to the Suri language. The summaries given below concern
the phonological, morphological and syntactic typological features of the language.
With respect to phonology, Mursi is a language with a fair number of phonemic
distinctions; it has a total of twenty-nine phonemes: twenty-two consonants (see Table
2.3) and seven vowels (see Table 2.6). Mursi, to a certain extent, stands apart from the
rest of the Southeastern Surmic Group languages (particularly from its closely related
languages Chai and Tirmaga), because it does not have the following consonant
phonemes: voiceless bilabial stop /p/, the palatal implosive /ʄ/, and the velar implosive
/ɠ/. The occurrence of the glottal stop is limited in all positions in a word. Due to its
limited distribution, its phonemic status is questioned by some Nilo-Saharan scholars,
but particularly by people who worked on the Southeastern language groups.
However, especially at the level of a phonological word versus a grammatical word
identification, vowels are highly complex, because Mursi vowels undergo a number of
morphophonological processes; including extensive vowel coalescence, harmony,
copying, deletion, change, subtraction and so on. The vowel copying is one of the most
widely spread and recurring morphophonological phenomenon in the language, and it
can occur as a single, double, triple, and quadruple vowel copying term (see Chapter 2;
§2.5.6.5). Vowel height harmony and vowel fronting harmony may also create a high
degree of complexity in the analysis of the properties of vowels. One similarity between
consonants and vowels is that both could have lengthened segments, but length in both
7is phonetically triggered by certain prosodic and phonological processes such as:
lengthened consonants at syllable boundaries and historical intervocalic consonant
deletion.
The maximal syllable template is CVC. A great majority of Mursi verb roots have
monosyllabic CVC shapes. Mursi has also two register tones: High and Low. Both are
contrastive and play significant roles both at the lexical and grammatical levels. It is
worth to note that grammatical tone plays a significant contrastive role in certain
morphological categories such as number, person, and mood.
In terms of morphology, Mursi has three open word classes ― verbs, nouns and
adjectives; and twelve closed word classes: pronouns, adverbs, adpositions
(postpositions and prepositions), question words, number words, quantifiers,
connectors, discourse particles, interjections, ideophones, and expressives (discussed
in detail in Chapter 3).
Mursi is an agglutinating language with some degree of fusion; it is highly synthetic
(up to seven morphemes per word). Mursi is a predominantly suffixing language. Verbs
have up to fourteen slots for verbal grammatical categories. Only a maximum of three
pre-root slots can be available for both inflectional and derivational markers to be added
to the verbal roots at a time (usually a negation marker proclitic followed by suffixes
marking subject, causative, aspect, mood and so on). Generally, as in most members of
the Surmic group languages, Mursi has few slots for prefixes. A Mursi post-verbal root
slot can host a maximum of five suffixes or a combination of both suffixes and an
enclitic. For example, verbal affixes appear roughly in the following order:
(1.1)ŋà=kó-jóg-ón-óŋ-Ø=ó-ɔ̀
NEG.IMPERV=1SU-tell-MT-2pl.OBJ-1pl.INC.SU.IMPERV=NEG-VFS
‘We (inc.) will not tell (it) to you (pl.).’Except tense, which is marked by two relative time referring particles (wa ‘recent past’;
be ‘distant past’) and by other separate time words, bound pronominals S/A and O
8arguments, aspect, mood, motion, and most valency and voice changing devices are
marked on the verb by inflection and derivation.
Morphologically, nouns can be defined as words that obligatorily inflect for number,
case, definiteness, and can occur with deictic categories. Nouns could have up to ten
affixal slots for nominal grammatical categories. There is only one pre-root slot for
deictic category and nine other post-root slots, of which four are shown by enclitics.
Number on nouns can be shown in a number of ways and by two types of morphological
forms: suffixes and clitics.
As many Nilo-Saharan languages, Mursi has a complex number marking system.
Thus nouns are divided into four sets based on how they mark number: ‘replacive’,
‘marked plural’, ‘singulative’, and ‘suppletive’. Some nouns utilize a tripartite number
marking system; ‘river’ kíɗó (singular), kíɗóì (singulative) and kíɗɛ́n (plural). A few
other nouns may utilize more than one plural suffix: ‘silver bracelet’ érésí (singular),
érésíó (plural) and/or érésíɲá (plural). Interestingly, close kinship nouns stand apart
from the rest of noun types in that they can be marked by a special plural number
marking suffix -čo. A total of about 70 portmanteau number markers are found in the
language, and all are suffixes (see Chapter 6). Nominal morphological categories
usually display the following affix-clitic orderings.

‘Those (field) watchings (vigils)’There are four morphological categories that can be encoded through double marking:
two on verbal words and two on nominal words. Of the four, two are encoded through9circumclitics (negation on verbs in the imperfective aspect and demonstrative system
on nouns). The third grammatical category, which is shown by double marking is
causative. Thus, causative derivation in Mursi can be shown by morphological markers
circumfixed directly to the verb root. The fourth grammatical category to be shown
through double marking is genitive case. It is a very rare feature in that it is the only
grammatical category in the language to be indicated by an identical marker in a
successive manner, as in (1.4)

people-RSTR
big.PL-RSTR local-GEN-GEN
‘Village elders’ (Lit. big (pl) people of the local area’)Mursi utilizes a complex aspect marking system, and aspect falls broadly into two
categories: imperfective and perfective. Roughly, aspect can be shown on verbs in the
following ways: by bound pronominal subject marking suffixes and by a number of
different verb root alternations and a morphological phenomenon. The verb root
alternation is quite complex and roughly one-third of Mursi verbs have different root
forms for imperfective and perfective aspects. This includes full suppletion, partial
suppletion, final consonant reduction/deletion, final syllable reduction, and multiple
alternation. There is also one morphological phenomenon, i.e. prefixing t(V)- onto verb
roots in the imperfective aspect (see Chapter 7; §7.3.1.2).
Mursi is a nominative-accusative language and has a canonical constituent order
AVO (for a transitive clause) and/or SV (for an intransitive clause). Core-arguments in
this constituent order are functionally-unmarked. In addition to this, depending on
clause types and pragmatic context, two other constituent orders are also utilized: an
AOV order (in negated clauses) (as in (1.5b)), and an OVA in a transitive clause and
VS in an intransitive clause where post-verbal subjects (S and A) are marked for
nominative case (as in (1.6)).","[30, 31, 32, 33]"
"10.2.2.1 Nominative case marking on pronouns
Mursi personal pronouns exist in two forms: (i) in neutral forms when occuring as preverbal subject and post-verbal object, and (ii) in nominative forms when occurring as
post-verbal subjects. In the non-canonical constituent order VS/OVA, the verb agrees
in number with the post-verbal nominative form pronouns. The first person plural
nominative form pronouns do not distinguish inclusive and exclusive subjects. Even
though nominative form pronouns have similar positions within clauses with nouns in
marked-nominative case, one basic difference can be noticed between the two. See the
two examples given below.

"Moreover, sentence-final positions,syntactic slots for core and non-core arguments may typically function as focus-bearing
positions when filled by question words. By using Mursi content questions words, one
can question the referents of clause final argument slots (NPs), location, time, quantity,
and so on. On the other hand, a polar question in Mursi can be formed either by raising
the intonation of the lexical constituents that occur at end of a clause or by placing noninterrogative particles at the end of a declarative statement.
Besides, Mursi does not adhere to Greenberg’s Universal Hypothesis 12. Greenberg
predicted that VSO languages always have interrogative words sentence-initially. In
Mursi and in other Southeastern Surmic group languages (AVO), interrogative words
always occur sentence-finally. Syntactically, as long as the O argument a is sentencefinal constituent, the difference between VSO [VAO] and AVO is not significant in
interrogative constructions. Of all interrogative words, tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ ‘why’ deviates from the
sentence-final pattern. The interrogative word ‘why’ has two varieties, one of which,
tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ, can be placed at sentence-initial position when used in some rhetorical questions.
In the light of the two straightforward question construction formation types and other
less common strategies of interrogatives, this chapters presents a detailed discussion of
508the structure of questions of the language. Thus, in the subsequent sections, content
questions (§12.2), non-interrogative particles (§12.3), polar questions (§12.4), and
other questioning strategies (§12.5) in the language are discussed in detail.
12.2 Content questions
Content question words normally fill both core and non-core argument slots. Since
question words occur at clause-final argument slot within strict constituent order, the
original constituents at the clause-final slot can be placed at clause-initial position.
Moreover, content question words are ‘pro-phrasals’ therefore they may come with
marked case and modification forms (cf. Mütze 2014). Content question words are of
two types: question words and interrogative pronouns. This distinction is based on the
properties that question words often display whenever they fill the non-question words’
syntactic slots, because both types of question words can fill whatever position is
natural for the non-question words corresponding to the same slot.

§12.2.8One basic observation that can be made from the forms of question words in Table 12.1
is the reoccurrence of /n/ and /g/ to distinguish between singular and plural numbers.
Typologically, the n/g(k) singular versus plural alternation is one of the most common
areal features, not only in Surmic languages but also in most languages of Eastern
Sudanic. Besides, except the interrogative tɛ́nɛ̀ŋ that can occur only sentence-initially,
all the rest of the interrogative words always occur at sentence-final positions.
Regarding the morphological status of interrogatives, some appear to have
originated from one common form ɔ̀ŋ even if it is not easy at this stage to trace back
how they fused in such way. Especially, many of the question (interrogative) words
appear to have the formative ɔ̀ŋ or -ɔŋ, may be at some point in early stages of the
language. Yet it is possible to analyze some of them as separate forms or morphemes,
for which each segmentable unit will carry its own independent grammatical meaning.
For example, the interrogative word ɔ́nɔ́ŋɔ́ ‘with what?’ is derived from the non-human
A nominative form ɔ́nɔ́ŋ ‘what?’ and the oblique case marker suffix -ɔ. The
interrogative ɔ́nɔ́ŋ itself appears to be a derived form possibly from nɔ̀ŋ ‘3sg’ (or third
person impersonal pronoun) (see Table 12.1) and the nominative case marker -ɔ (as
prefix). As the forms themselves hint, a number of such plausible explanations could
be presented in order to trace back the origins of Mursi interrogative forms,―but they
may not consist of more than three formative.
Last and Lucassen (1998: 415) noted that the form */a-ŋa/ ‘what’ (with a copula)
have been attested in Proto-Nilotic. They also suggested that this could be one of the
oldest question word formation within the Eastern Sudanic language family. For
instance, present-day languages such as Luo (a-ŋɔ ‘what’) and Päri (a-ŋo ‘what’, a-ŋa
‘who’) have maintained the proto-forms.","[531, 532, 533]"

In the examples above, there are two options why the A argument is retained: (i) by the

independent pronouns shouldn’t be considered as optional constituents). Even if the
verb jóg ‘tell’ in (10.13c) is a ditransitive verb, it does not require a secondary object.

In addition to what we saw in simple mono-transitive clauses illustrated above, the
canonical constituent order AVO may have also various syntactic manifestations in
double object or ditransitive clause constructions and in other types of clauses. In order
to explain how syntactic relations of the direct and indirect object of a double object or
ditransitive clause constructions be recognized, there are certain key points to be taken
into account. For instance, in a double object construction, the indirect object or
secondary object may be placed at the first post-verbal slot and will have a semantic
role of recipient/beneficiary, or it can be moved to a clause-final position in the same
semantic role. This can be shown in two ways― (i) when the benefactive applicative
suffix -ɛ̀sɛ̀n is attached to the verb in its primary function (benefactive), and (ii) when
it is attached to the verb in its secondary function (dative).
The primacy of one object over another may be based upon person and non-person
forms. For example, when the double object construction makes use of the benefactive
suffix and if both the objects are non-person forms, the post-verbal adjacency priority
is given to the beneficiary, or to the indirect object, as in (10.17).

In example below (10.17c), nɔ̀ŋ is an impersonal pronoun functioning as direct object.
The benefactive function here looks more of a motion away (itive) marker than showing
benefactive reading. The impersonal pronoun nɔ̀ŋ will not be regarded as a person form
object, thus semantically it does not make any difference whether or not it appear in its
position.

However, the way syntactic Os can be coded in ditransitive clauses is different from
the way two object arguments are coded in double-object clauses. The syntactic position
of O arguments in ditransitive clauses may rely on the semantic roles and animacy
status of the respective objects. Mütze (2014) noticed that the object of a monotransitive verb is marked like a [+human] argument of the ditransitive verb for which
human arguments have semantic recipient roles. On the other hand, object and recipient
(R) behave in the same way as primary objects while the theme (T) is a secondary
object. Recall the object of monotransitive clauses given in the examples above and
compare with the following ditransitive clauses below.","[484, 485, 486, 487]"
"533Chapter 1313.1NegationIntroductionTypologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. In
Mursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbal
constituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories such
as aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect can
be negated by bound circumclitics while a verb in the perfective aspect is negated by
independent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus by
the negative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. For instance, a verb in the
imperfective aspect can be negated by bound circumclitics [ŋà=…=ó] ~
<ŋà=ROOT.IMPERV=ó>, while a perfective verb can be negated by independent
perfective negative form particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet’ and by the negative
enclitic attached to the root ~ <ŋànì k(V)-ROOT.PERV=ó>. So, when the negative is a
perfective verb, only the negator enclitic =ó will be utilized. A further interesting point
here is that in a negative imperative, only the negator proclitic ŋà= will be used thus
the enclitic =ó can be replaced by markers of other grammatical categories appropriate
to that slot such as number and verb-final suffix.
The grammatical function of the k(V)- prefix when negating a perfective verb is to
refer to first person subject. Besides, the subjunctive which often times applies to the
third person irrealis mood can be indicated by the same prefix. This prefix cannot occur
if the negated verb involves second person subject.
Furthermore, negative declarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV constituent
order, in which negated verbs always occur clause-finally. This is confined to the
negative clause constituent order, which is different from the affirmative canonical
534constituent SV/AVO order. The negation system that operates in the imperfective
aspect will have AO[Neg=V=Neg] while the perfective aspect have AO Neg.PART
[V=Neg].
Therefore, this chapter provides a detailed account of negators which occur in bound as
well as independent forms. Accordingly, bound negators are discussed in §13.2
followed by various independent negator words or particles in §13.3.","[556, 557, 558]"

(see Chapter 4)Another relevant deduction that can be made for sure from the discussions we saw in
the aforementioned sections is that the syntactic position of independent pronouns in
both AVO and OVA constituent orders can also be viewed from a pragmatically driven
point of view. In most cases, as long as the bound pronominal S, A and O argument
markers are cross-referenced on the verb, independent pronouns can be optional.
However, pragmatically, S/A referring independent pronouns in the SV/AVO order are
often topical constituents while in the VS/OVA order they can be seen as focused
constituents. Indeed, this requires further investigation.","[498, 499]"

"12.5 Polar questions
The term polar question is a more appropriate label than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ question (Dixon
2012: 377). As Dixon argues, some languages may lack words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in their
lexicon and Mursi is one of them. Instead Mursi utilizes default interjections, negative
particle word/particle or copula verbs ― see the examples given in (12.43a-c).

Like in interrogative words, in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takes
sentence-final position. In other words, it is the constituent with a raised intonation that
is expected to take the focus position and this could be by moving the constituent to the
right most slot of the clause ―for example kíɲáŋ in (12.43a). In polar questions, if the
sentence involves copula verb, obviously the copula complement will be a constituent
upon which a high pitch rests, as in (12.43c).

studentIn almost all cases, the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polar
questions are exactly the same. The English equivalents to the Mursi interjections in
above examples will be ɪmm ‘no’ and ɪɲɲ ‘yes’. It is quite common for interjections to
have a different phonology. For instance, both of these interjections contain a short
central vowel which is not part of the sound system of the language and may have a
monosyllabic VCG shape (where G stands for geminates).
When a intransitive clause is set to indicate a polar questions, it is on the intransitive
verb that the high pitch level can be shown, ― otherwise the verb remains high-toned
in most cases.

Positive declarative sentences are not the only syntactic structures that have identical
order of constituents with polar questions, negative declarative sentences have also
identical order. Thus in negative polar interrogative and negative declarative sentences,
the verb is placed in focus position at the end of the sentence, as in (12.45a-b).

"4.3.1 Introduction to head and dependent modification system
Cross-linguistically, it is not common to see languages that mark both the head and the
dependent with a special morphological marking. It is a rare phenomenon to find
languages that have obligatory head-modifier dependency relationship markers.
However, Mursi is among the few languages in the world that have an overt
morphological marking for head nouns and for the dependents. The term ‘dependent’
210here directly refers to any ‘modifier’. However, in order to convey the notion to be
discussed in this section, I find the term ‘dependent’ more appropriate. Thus, this
dependency phenomenon of head nouns and dependents is known as Construct-Form
(CF). In Semitic languages this phenomenon is known by a different term ― construct
state.
For years, a number of Semitic linguists have dealt with this topic. Some have also
proposed various terms for it. For instance, ‘status constructus’ (Turker and Bryan
1966), ‘antigenitive’ (Anderson 1988), ‘modified noun form’ (Reh 1996), and
‘construct form’ (Criessels 2006).
The terms given above by various linguists are purely morphological. They are caseoriented terms particularly focusing on the genitive case. In other words, terms such as
genitive and antigenitive are mostly morphological properties of dependents in NPs.
For example, in Mursi, case is entirely a property of dependents whereas construct form
is a property of head nouns. In Mursi, the construct form (a ‘modification marker’ from
now on) suffix is a kind of relator that indicates the dependency relationship between
the head and the dependent. Therefore, the modification marker on head nouns is a
syntactic property which provides information about the internal structure of NPs.
In Mursi, construct form is a particular instance of a head marking and a dependent
marking system. But there are also a few instances where we can get the modification
suffixes on modifiers. For example, when the modifier itself is a noun, or when two or
more heads/modifiers co-occur as relative clause modifier, in nominalized clause
modifiers, and embedded noun modification constructions. In this case, we get a series
of modification forms with embedded modifiers.
First, one has to understand whether the construct form phenomenon is an internal
structure of NPs or is controlled by other NP external related syntactic information. It211is possible to see what the head-modifier dependency relationship looks like. One finds
that there are two head-modifier dependency relationships: restrictive and nonrestrictive. As in some Western Nilotic languages which show this form of dependency
relationships in their NP internal structure, the choice between the two (restrictive/nonrestrictive) depends on the type of modifiers. Both restrictive and non-restrictive
markers attached to the head of a relative clause can also entail that the relative clause
modifier should appear right-adjoined to the NP.","[233, 234, 235]"

As can be shown in the examples stated above, post-verbal pronouns in the intransitive

Following the verb ker the nominative pronoun form is in the S function, and following
the copula verb there is an interrogative word ɛ̀nɛ̀ŋ, a form often used for the expression
of ‘will or wish’. Note that the occurrence of the conditional/temporal word húllí
‘if/when’ does not show that the clause is a conditional/subordinate clause. Conditional
clauses have their own specific formula ― always begin with húllí and always end with
a word marked by a subordinate marker suffix =jè (húllí (x) (y)…(z)=jè). In addition,
clauses that refer to speakers 'will/wish' have húllí at their clause-initial positions in the
same way as conditional clauses.
In passive construction, S is treated like O thus object pronominal suffixes of active
clauses are used to indicate the S. The underlying A argument (semantic agent) can in88The suffix -ʃa appears to function as a nominalizer and may have been derived from the ideophones
such as luʃ (describes a situation or the way of dying suddenly), ɓeʃ (describes something happening
abruply, all of a sudden) and so on. It may be analyzed as a sound-maker marker.","[494, 495, 496]"
"Clausal modifiersA clausal modifier of the NP is mainly the relative clause which involves finite verbs.
The verb in a relative clause modifier usually consists of full verbal inflections, and a
construct form suffix for a restrictive and sometimes for a nominalizing function. Given
that the canonical constituent order of Mursi is AVO, nominal subjects are always in
its preverbal position, preceding the relative clause. Table 4.4 below is a summary of
the structure of relative clauses modifying the NP.

One plausible reason for acquiring such a rich expression of syntactic construction of
possession is that it has both head and dependent marking system. As a head-dependent
marking language, both the head and the dependent are marked by appropriate
dependency relation marking morphological elements. As we recall from Chapter 4, the
head can be marked with two different morphologies ― modification markers
(restrictive/non-restrictive) and pertensive. When it is converted into possessive
construction, the head is always the possessed noun (D) and the dependent/modifier is
the possessor (R). In other words, taking the two distinct morphological markings to be
used on possessed nouns, and the various possessor types into account, it would be
logical to expect very diverse possessive construction types in the language. The
various syntactic constructions and possibilities of indicating possession/ownership
should follow the syntactic frame of ‘NP-internal possessive construction’.
Possession within an NP can be viewed as one of the realizations of a broader
concept of association or relationship between two nouns (Aikhenvald 2013:2).
Accordingly, five NP-internal possessive construction types have been identified in
Mursi: one structure where R and D are simply juxtaposed within an NP, and four other
distinct structures where D is followed by R.","[248, 249]"
"291Chapter 7 The verb and predicate structure7.1IntroductionThe verb is the second largest open word class in Mursi. The verb is a primary word
which functions as head of a predicate. Adjectives that function as heads of intransitive
predicates are those that are derived from stative verbs. This chapter offers an overview
of the phonological properties of the verb roots, and component grammatical elements
associated with the inflectional categories of the verb such as subject and object
agreement, aspect, and mood. Verbs and their component grammatical elements
constitute one of the most complex parts of Mursi morphology. Some verb roots can
undergo up to four time morphological alternations to indicate aspect. Others undergo
up to two or more than two-term verb root alternations in order to indicate grammatical
number and aspect.
Moreover, a number of most salient phonological and morphological properties of
verbs are discussed in this chapter. Based on the phonological properties they display,
verb roots have been classified into three major types, and a number of sub-types may
exist within each type (§7.2). The subsequent section (§7.3) will illustrate some of the
verbal inflections ― participant reference (§7.3.1.1), aspect (§7.3.1.2), mood
(§7.3.1.3), tense (§7.3.1.4) followed by the multiverbal constructions (§7.3.1.5). Also,
in two sub-sections, copula verbs in (§7.3.1.2.9) and auxiliary in (§7.3.1.2.10) are
discussed in detail respectively.
7.2Phonological properties of verb rootsThe segmental structure of roots is one of the most salient phonological features of the
verbs. Roughly 90 percent of Mursi verb roots start and end in consonants.","[314, 315]"
"3.2.3AdjectivesAdjectives comprise the third largest open word class in Mursi. Adjectives comprise an
open class just by derivation. Without their derived members, adjectives would have
formed a closed class consisting of just two members ― tííní ‘small’ and búí ‘big’. Due
to their phonological and morphosyntactic properties they display, I have labeled these149two adjectives as 'underived'. Thus the two form one of the smallest subclasses of
words in the language (see §8.2.1 & §8.3.1).
Adjectives share a number of grammatical properties with nouns and verbs. For
example, adjectives may be marked for number in the same way as nouns. When
modifying the head of an NP, they may take nominal grammatical categories such as
case and definite markers, as in (3.57).
(3.57)[ŋà=hír=á
DEM=man=NEAR
‘of the bad man’gɛ̀rs-í-ɲ=ŋà]NP

grammatical properties with verbs than nouns. Both adjectives and verbs share the
following categories: bound pronominal S/O arguments, passive-nominalizer,
comparative-benefactive (own term), negation and verb-final suffix. The following
examples clearly show the grammatical categories that both adjectives and verbs have
in common (repeated from §8.4.2)

‘I am sick.’In order to be considered an adjectives, all adjectives (underived and derived) must bear
the general adjectiviser suffix -i.
Syntactically, adjectives can modify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive
predicate slot, fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in
comparative constructions, and function as manner modifiers.
The adjective class of Mursi covers all semantic types that can be conveyed by
adjectives. A total of about 160 adjectives have been identified in this study (see
Chapter 8).
1503.3Closed word classesAs mentioned earlier in the introductory section, pronouns, adverbs, adpositions,
question words, number words and quantifiers, connectors, interjections, ideophones,
expressives, and discourse particles comprise the closed word class of the language.","[172, 173, 174]"
"However, we may find a notable sound pattern difference between a phonological
word and ideophones (plus interjections/expressives). For instance, consonant clusters
such as: *bs, *mk, *mɗ, *sɗ, gj, and *ŋt are found in ideophones while such clusters do
not exist in a phonologival word. In Mursi, non-phonemic consonants or vowels may
be found in ideophones and in interjections ―*p (voiceless bilabial stop) *ɪ (close
central vowel). Mursi expressives can a C1VC2 shapes (where C2 stands for voiceless
postalveolar fricative [ʃ]). There is no such syllable shape pattern in a phonological
word (§2.9).
2.7.2 A grammatical word
A grammatical word may contain a number of grammatical elements, mainly three are
crucial: (i) they always occur together (cohesiveness), (ii) they occur in a fixed order,
and (iii) they have a conventionalized coherence and meaning (Dixon and Aikhenvald
2003: 19). Even though few exceptional conditions exist, almost all grammatical words
107of Mursi can be governed by these three criteria. Thus, a grammatical word in Mursi
must consist of a root (nominal or verbal) and a minimum of one morpheme. A
grammatical word therefore can consist of from two up to seven grammatical elements
(morphemes) that occur together. See the examples given below:

‘We (inc.) will not tell (it) to you (pl).’In (2.82a), we see a minimal verbal word consisting of a root (the citation form) marked
by a zero morpheme third person singular subject marker on the imperfective aspect. In
(2.82b) is a maximal nominal word consisting of four grammatical elements ― a suffix
and three clitics. A minimal nominal word can be extracted out of (2.82b), i.e. múɲíɲ-í
‘star (sg.)’. Of these, the demonstrative system shown by the circumclitics
(ŋà=…=tùnù), is a good indication of grammatical elements cohesiveness in a
grammatical word. The order of these grammatical elements in no way changes. In
(2.82c), we find a typical example that shows the morphological nature of a word in
Mursi, i.e. agglutinating and predominantly suffixing. Like the circumclitics indicating
the demonstrative system on nominals (2.82b), negation on verbs is mainly indicated
by circumclitics (ŋà=…=ó). Both the circumclitics could then be taken as a perfect
proof that grammatical elements occur in a fixed order. As shown clearly, all the
grammatical words in (2.82a-c) have a conventionalized coherence and full-fledged
meaning.","[130, 131]"
"473no way be expressed after the passive verb has been omitted. Since Mursi has zero
realization of the third person O suffix, the third passive form attaches a vowel suffix V (usually by copying the vowel of a consonant-initial verb root).

Here, the canonical constituent order is SV-Obl (may reflects an underlying A) passive
construction, even though it is impossible to add an A argument after the passive verb
(unless as a peripheral argument with an oblique case), as is shown in (10.31a). Due to
the post-verbal marked-nominative principle in non-canonical OVA, the nominative
pronoun àggèù may reflect a semantic agent. As König (2008: 178) pointed out,
nominative can have function encoding agents in a passive-like clause. König listed
Maa and Dinka languages as having a system where agents are encoded by the
nominative in passive construction. As the example (10.31a) clearly shows, Mursi has
a similar encoding strategy where it uses post-verbal nominative pronoun forms as
agents in passive-like constructions. A plausible explanation may be the one provided
by König referring to Gerrit Dimmendaal's personal communication.
Accordingly, marked-nominative may have come into existence first as a marker of
peripheral A/S arguments in passive-like constructions (König (2008: 179).
Morphological devices such as instrumental and locative that are used to encode
peripheral participants can also be used to encode agents of passive-like clauses in some
languages. Although this is not the exact scenario for Mursi, there seems to be the case
where the markers of the post-verbal nominative subjects and markers of the agent-like
peripheral arguments that follow the passive verb are alike. Compare the nominative
case suffix -ɔ of (10.26) with the oblique (instrumental) -ɔ on the peripheral argument
of (10.28a). Compare the nominative marker suffix -ɔ [o] in (10.26) with the
instrumental marker suffix -ɔ on the peripheral argument below in (10.31b).

8.4.5 Adjectives functioning as manner modifiers
Adjectives and adverbs may have the same forms but they can only be distinguished
by the syntactic slots they occupy in clauses. When adjectives function as modifiers,
they often occur immediately after the verb they modify. When they occur in this
position, they most likely are marked by the suffix –o [-no].

Mursi is a free-constituent order language; the order among adjectives within NPs and
in sentences is relatively free. As to the ordering of adjectives within NPs, as has been
noted throughout this chapter, no more than two adjectival modifiers are available.

The size of the set of adjectives in each semantic type may vary, but Mursi adjectives
cover all semantic classes. All thirteen semantic classes of adjectives proposed by
Dixon (2004:3) have been attested in Mursi.
413A. DIMENSION ― this set is comprised of about ten adjectives. It is a unique set where
the two underived adjectives belong.

Mursi: čàgì ‘new’80, ɲàgàsi ‘old’, kíŋíɲí ‘ancient, antique’, and tɛ̀rì ‘young’.
D. COLOUR ―The Mursi utilize a most complex colour and colour pattern systems.
This is due to the complicated use of coat-colour of cattle for personal naming as well
as for names of cattle herds (see Chapter 1 §1.8). Colour adjectives in Mursi occur in
two different cognitive semantic categories: colours and patterns which can be used
alone or in combinations of colours and patterns. As is shown in Table 3 below, those
listed under colour category are basic colour terms in Mursi. The rest are patterns which
denote non-basic colour terms. There are also two other colour categories that exist
either in concrete terms or hetero-compound forms. The concrete terms are similes of
animals, trees, objects, etc., thus they are hetero-compounds composed of colour terms
and objects. The following examples illustrate how colours and patterns or colours and80/addisi/ is a derived adjective from Amharic ― addis ‘new, name a city’414concrete terms are combined together; and how they are used in the Mursi person
naming system (see §1.8).

"As was attempted to demonstrate in the examples above, the verb derivation technique
is a productive way to express reciprocal meanings in Mursi. One more common
strategy in many languages but that Mursi lacks, is a reciprocal construction containing
an inherently reciprocal verb.
The grammaticalized body part noun kɛ̀ŋɔ̀ ‘stomach/belly’ > ‘each other, among’
functions as a reciprocal marker grammatical word. Both transitive and intransitive
verbs can occur with the reciprocal marker kɛ̀ŋɔ̀ within one reciprocal construction.
In Chai, a closest relative to Mursi within the Southeast Surmic language group, kɛ̀ŋɔ̀
means ‘occurrences, times’. In a clause, kɛ̀ŋɔ̀ usually takes a clause final slot (occurs at
the end of a clause).

RECIPIn (9.17) and (9.18), the co-occurrence of the verbal derivation suffixes together with
the reciprocal marker kɛ̀ŋɔ̀ requires further investigation, but at this stage, seems to be
related to transitivity of the verb, i.e. specifically a transitive verb . The rest of the
reciprocal constructions (9.15, 9.16 and 9.19) have verbs that are not marked for the
reciprocal derivation marker suffix. An additional transitive verb example is presented
below.

The sociative marker kàrì ‘together’ can denote reciprocity in its own. It also
expresses joint actions or participants being in a ‘collectivity’. Similar to a reciprocal
construction that involves a transitive verb and the reciprocal marker kɛ̀ŋɔ̀, it occurs
together with a transitive verb marked for a reciprocal derivational suffix. See the
examples illustrated below.

The apposed participants (subjects) within the reciprocal construction represented by

The last strategy that could properly deliver a reciprocal meaning is reduplication.
Intransitive verbs may require a reduplicated adverb or number word. Thus, a
reduplicated adverb may show whether the action is performed simultaneously but not
sequentially (as in (9.23-9.24). In contrast, a reduplicated number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ >
ɗɔ́nɛ́ɗɔ́nɛ́ is an etymon for ‘one another’ (Lit. ‘one-one’), and has an additional meaning
to the reciprocity of the action, i.e. the action is performed sequentially (for example,
the sequentiality of the act of talking in (9.25)).

In fact, in (9.25) the grammaticalized reciprocal maker kɛ̀ŋɔ̀ appears to provide the real
reciprocal meaning, but its real function is to provide a distributive meaning (see
§6.11.4). Only one intransitive verb that I know of can be combined with reduplicated
adverbial form ― tɛ́l-i ʤáʤá <exist.PERV.PL-3pl.IRR near-near> ‘approach each

prefix i-forming.
9.2.4 Reflexive
Semantically, as suggested by Dixon (2012: 146), a prototypical reflexive construction
shows reflexive situations happen when two arguments of a single verb have identical
reference. Syntactically, in Mursi, a reflexive construction has two reflective elements
in O slot ― (i) a reflexive pronoun (it is normally an NP containing the grammaticalized
body part nouns sábá ‘head’ and ‘body’ rɛ̀ as its head nouns) and possessive pronouns
as modifiers, and (ii) an autoreflexive-like particle ɓíí ‘self, own, alone’ (an invariant
form for all persons and number of the A=O arguments). With regard to cross-linguistic
reflexive and reciprocal constructions, Dixon (2012: 151-6) suggested eight
generalizations. Accordingly, Mursi complies with GENERALIZATION D, where reflexive
and reciprocal pronouns may both be invariant or informative. However, as he suggests,
‘if only one is informative, then this is reflexive’. This is the first truth. There is the
second truth that perfectly reflects Mursi reflexive construction in general, ‘there are
languages with informative reflexive pronouns and an invariant reciprocal pronoun (not
the reverse)’ (p.154).
In Mursi, a reflexive meaning is conveyed in two ways:
i.[sábá ‘head’/rɛ̀ ‘body’+ POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS]REFLEXIVE.PRO:NP/O ―
‘informative’ii.[ɓii] AUTOREFLEXIVE:NP/O ― ‘invariant’9.2.4.1 sábá ‘head’/rɛ̀ ‘body’+ Possessive pronouns
A prototypical reflexive construction in Mursi can be formed from an A argument (also
known as ‘controller’/’antecedent’), a transitive verb, and from an O argument (the two433grammaticalized body part nouns plus possessive pronouns). The argument, which is
placed in O function is a reflexive pronoun/an NP [sábá-á/rɛ̀-a -Possessive pronouns],
sometimes referred to as ‘informative’ ― because it copies information about the
person and number of the controller (cf. Dixon 2012: 154). Examples are illustrated as
follows.

SG.PSD=2SG.PSRAs it is shown in these examples, the reflexive pronouns formed by the two human body
nouns and possessive pronouns fill the O argument slot. All (9.26-9.29) are transitive
clauses. The reflexive pronouns in Mursi are NPs in their own right ― two human body
nouns as NP heads marked with the restrictive dependency/relator marker –a and
possessive pronouns as modifiers. Any change of the head will result in an anaphoric
inequivalency with the subject. For example, when sábá ‘head’ of the reflexive pronoun
in (9.26) is changed into sɛnɔ ‘hand.PL’ (as in (9.30), it will result in A≠O.

‘S/he washed her/his own hands.’
The anaphoric reference in O function (9.30) is part of the subject but does not fully
specify the subject itself ― because it cannot function as a reflexive pronoun. The
434anaphoric reference in (9.30) is a simple possessive O NP. There is one possibility
where the pertensive form of rɛ̀ > rɛ̀ɛ̀ <body.PERT.SG.3.PSR> functions as O without the
possessive pronoun. Outside some close kinship nouns, this is the only noun that can
be possessed inalienably. But rɛ̀ɛ̀ can be placed in O argument slot if it has a 3rd person
singular controller ― with a meaning ‘his body’ (possessive NP) > ‘himself’
(reflexive), as in (9.31).

‘S/he went and hanged herself/himself.’ (Lit. ‘his body’)
An extended transitive (ditransitive) verb (as in (9.30)) can be re-adjusted and made a
transitive verb. This can easily be achieved by attaching the coreference of the E
argument to the ditransitive verb root. Thus the benefactive marker suffix -ɛsɛ indicates
the coreference of the E (ŋàbà(à) ~ ‘this world’), not of the A. The coreference of the
A argument (2nd person singular suffix) will be omitted. In this particular case, as also
noted by Dixon (2012: 160), the O argument for the English verb 'give', is either 'gift'
or 'recipient'. So, in the English reflexive construction, the preferred structure is to treat
the 'Gift' as O. As it is illustrated in (9.29) above, rɛ̀á nùnù is the O argument. However,
the reflexive construction in (9.29) is an exception. There are certain syntactic
constraints which could be regarded as exceptions of a Mursi reflexive construction,
for example, attaching the benefactive marker suffix in (9.29) to the transitive verb of
(9.27) is not allowed. If the benefactive marker suffix -ɛsɛ is attached to the verb root
mès, the meaning would become that of a benefactive applicative or dative referring to
'recipient'/'gift', as in (9.32).

SG.PSD=2SG.PSRTherefore, (9.32) is a benefactive construction which has an unspecified third person
singular constituent in its O argument.
9.2.4.2 The invariant reflexive particle ɓííí ‘self, own, alone’
The reflexive particle ɓíí has an invariant form for all persons. This lexicalized reflexive
marker can function as genuine reflexive and emphatic reflexive marker/autoreflexive.
An equivalent English form for ɓíí is ‘self’. As Dixon (2012: 167) described, in the
English, the reflexive form ‘self’ functions as the provider of an argument slot other
than the subject. In Mursi, ɓíí functions the same way as in English. When it functions
as a genuine reflexive marker, it takes the O argument slot following the predicate. In
order to get the genuine reflexive reading, a transitive verb is always preferred over an
intransitive one.

The second clause of (9.33) and (9.34a) are typical reflexive construction. But, in two
instances, its meaning may be changed into an emphatic reflexive one. The first is due
to a coreferential constraint where the invariant reflexive marker ɓíí is preceded by

9.3 Valency-increasing derivations
In the subsequent sections, valency increasing derivations are discussed in detail.
9.3.1 Benefactive-applicative
The benefactive-applicative (or one can call it ‘dative-applicative’) increases the
valency of either an intransitive or a transitive verb. The benefactive-applicative437derivation adds an O argument to an underlying intransitive clause and forms a derived
transitive clause.

In (9.38), in addition to the benefactive-applicative suffix -ɛsɛ, it takes the
applicative/comitative marker -ɛ, which is another verb valency increasing derivational
marker. The co-occurrence of the two valency increasing derivations on a single438intransitive verb may result in the structural meaning of ‘they worshipped on their own,
on the mountain’.

Most frequently, independent personal pronouns are optional as subjects and are usually
shown by the bound pronominal suffixes attached to the verb. In other words, subjects
of the intransitive clauses can be recoverable from the person/subject markers expressed
by bound pronominal suffixes on the verb. But when the A argument is an NP, it cannot
be an optional constituent. But, when the A argument is an NP instead of a pronoun, it
usually be specified fully.

‘two among the girls will come and go back to those the elders to whom we

In (9.43), we see benefactive markers being applied on both intransitive (jàg ‘return’)
and transitive (bír ‘collect’) verbs. Yet, as discussed below, we shall see how the
benefaction derivation applies to transitive verbs.
A benefactive applicative derivation can also raise the number of arguments of a
transitive verb by one more argument and can turn it into a ditransitive verb. In a
ditransitive benefactive construction, the beneficiary or recipient is one for whom the
action is being done. In other words, syntactically, in clauses containing benefactive-439driven ditransitive verb forms, a new O argument is will be introduced in addition to
the existing original O argument (Mütze 2014).

applies to an underlying transitive clause (Mursi's version ‘comitative/applicative’), in
Mursi the benefactive applicative derivation in a transitive clause seems to apply the
same way because the underlying A argument stays as is (cf. Dixon and Aikhenvald
2000: 14). The underlying O argument will be moved out from its primacy slot and be
placed in a secondary O (O2) slot following the new O (O1) argument. Thus, hùlè and
lúsì can be called the new direct objects while mà and búŋ́áì become the new indirect
objects.
When the benefactive suffix is used in a dative function, the direct object remain as is,
as in (9.47 and 9.48).

3sgSyntactically, in many instances, although it is not possible to increase the valency of
the verb without showing the newly added argument, in Mursi, it is possible to
increase valency in such a way as long as the benefactive marker suffix is attached to
the verb. For example, from the clauses in (9.47-9.48), one can easily understand or
imply that there are beneficiaries/recipients (the participants whom the actions are
being done for) even if the indirect objects are absent.","[453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"
"116Chapter 3 Word classes3.1IntroductionMursi has three open word classes and twelve closed word classes. The open word
classes are: nouns (§3.2.1), verbs (§3.2.2) and adjectives (§3.2.3). The set of closed
word classes include pronouns (§3.3.1), adverbs (§3.3.2), adpositions (§3.3.3)
(prepositions and postpositions), question words (3.3.4), number words and quantifiers
(§3.3.5), connectors and discourse particles (§3.3.6), interjections (§3.3.7), ideophones
(§3.3.8), and expressives (§3.3.9). Although each word class displays their own distinct
morphological, syntactic and semantic properties, establishing a straightforward
distinctions between word classes may not be always easy. For example, some members
of the adjective class share certain morphological categories with nouns ― such as
number, demonstrative and definite. Likewise, adjectives can also share morphological
categories with verbs ― such as person, mood, valency changing derivations and
negation.
As these morphological categories do not exclusively apply to each and every
members of a particular word class, extensive morphological and syntactic criteria must
be applied in order to distinguish one from the other before making either a
characterization statement or establishing exceptions. Moreover, as suggested in
Aikhenvald (2015: 81), morphological structure and categories on one hand, and
syntactic functional slots in a clause on the other hand are among the essential criteria
for distinguishing between word classes. Apart from the two productive criteria, one
phonological criterion has been found to be a salient segmental property of verb roots
for distinguishing verbs from the rest word classes, i.e. roughly 90 percent of Mursi
verb roots end in consonants. This will be discussed in §7.2, Chapter 7. In addition,
117interjections and expressives have also a peculiar phonology quite different from other
word classes (see the last two subsequent sections of chapter 2). Therefore, this chapter
presents a detailed account of morphological and syntactic features of word classes
based on the language’s internal structure. Before embarking onto the details of each

syntactic functions and functional slots.

√The syntactic functions and functional slots of the word classes listed in Table 3.1
above may be possible properties of a particular word class as a whole and only
represent general syntactic features of that particular class. However, some word classes
may have sub-classes with their own specific syntactic functions, for example, the noun
class has about five members, and each sub-classes may show some degree of
peculiarities of morphology and syntax in line with general feature of the class.
3.2 Open word classes
In the following sections, the morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of the
three open word classes of the language, nouns (§3.2.1), verbs (§3.2.2) and adjectives
(§3.2.3) are discussed.
1183.2.1 Nouns
A noun class generally includes: simple nouns, relator nouns, place names, kinship
nouns, proper names, and compound nouns. Apart from these, all other nouns can be
members of this class through various derivations mainly from verbs and adjectives.
The morphological categories that these noun types in general take (§3.2.1.1) and the
syntactic functional slots they fill in a clause (§3.2.1.2) will be discussed. Following
this, descriptions have been provided for each noun type (see §3.2.1.3). Mursi has no
grammatical gender, but a brief overview of natural gendered nouns is presented in
(§3.2.4).
3.2.1.1 Morphological categories of nouns
Morphologically, nouns can be defined as words that obligatorily inflect for number,
case, demonstrative, and definiteness. Number on nouns can be shown in a number of
ways and by two morphological forms: suffixes and clitics. There is only one pre-root
slot for deictic function and nine other post-root slots of which four are shown by
enclitics. Table 3.2 below is a schematic representation of the structure of a Mursi noun
and suffix-clitic ordering.

SLOT 11119Note that not all these morphological categories of nouns can be added to noun roots at
a time. At the same time, noun roots cannot have the same capacity in taking these
categories at once. For example, de-verbal nouns or nouns derived from verbs by the
nominalizer -a can take nominative and other case morphologies. This is not the case
for other de-verbal nouns.
Based on the morphological slots shown in Table 3.2, the morphological category
indicating the demonstrative function takes SLOT 1. The demonstrative system of Mursi
is always shown by circumclitics. That is, the demonstrative marker proclitic (SLOT 1)
always co-occurs with a two-way deictic contrast marker enclitic (SLOT 8) (see Chapter
4, §4.2.1). SLOT 2 is a noun root itself. The noun root refers to simple nouns and relator
nouns. Aside from these, the term de-verbal noun can be appropriate for all other
morphological form of nouns which co-occur with SLOT 5. On nouns that are derived
from verbs, number marking is applied after the nominalizer, as in (3.1).
(3.1)[ŋà=ɓɛ́g-á-ɲá-ìnù]NP
DEM=watch-NOMZ-PL=FAR
‘Those (field) watchings (vigils)’SLOT 3 is generally a slot for overt tripartite coding of number ― replacive, plural, and
singulative. About 70 portmanteau number marking suffixes fill this nominal slot (see
number system, Chapter 5). Apart from the noun class, some members of the adjective
class namely dimension and colour adjectives may take overt number marking (see §3.4
of this chapter, and Chapter 8).The case system which marks both core and non-core
constituents fills SLOT 4. The case marking system depends highly on constituent order.
In general, nouns can be marked for case suffixes of any type when occurring postverbally (see Chapter 10). SLOT 6 can be filled by the pertensive morphology. Only
kinship nouns take pertensive morphology.

brother=PERT.1PL.PSR-PL
PL.PSD=1PL.EXC.PRS/PL.PSD=1PL.INC.PRS
‘Our (exc./inc.) brothers’
Pertensive morphology on the kinship nouns indicates number of possessed,
possessor and person (as in (3.2b-c). The possessive pronouns can follow kinship
nouns marked by pertensive morphology usually when further grammatical
information (first person inclusive/exclusive distinction) is required, as in (3.2d).
This may also show kinship nouns that may be marked for the same category twice
― or literally on the basis of a recursive system (see Chapter 4). Furthermore, the
suffix -čo is a plural number marker that can occur only with few kinship nouns (see
Chapter 6 for a full list of-čo taking kinship nouns). As can be seen in (3.2d),
whenever a modifier follows the head within an NP, the head noun will then be
marked for modification/relator marker suffix: -a (restrictive) and -ti/-i (nonrestrictive). Therefore SLOT 7 will be filled by a modification/relator marker.
SLOTS 8-11 are clitics which will be marked on nouns occurring in NPs and clauses.","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

Interestingly, when S and O pronominal arguments attach to adjectival roots, their main
(8.47)meaning of the inflected adjectival root is causative and inchoative. In fact, inchoative
readings come in two ways: by bound pronominal in S function (8.48) and by the
perfective copula te (8.49).

‘S/he became thin by her/him not drinking milk.’In (8.48), the head noun which denotes a state of quality is a derived noun from the
adjective kɔ̀rɔ̀ì. It is an NP on its own (in S function) followed by an intransitive
predicate with an optional oblique argument. The multi-function particle ɓá ‘place, in
408place, by’ is a cause marker in reason clauses, and along with reason-applicative marker
-ɛ, may denote a substantival deverbal nominalization reading ‘for (by) not drinking’.
In this case, the adjective is a copula complement.
Unlike the O argument in (8.46), nɔ̀ŋ in (8.49) indicates the object of a causative.
Since grammatical relations in Mursi mostly depend on participant reference marking
on the verb, independent arguments are not required as such. When independent
arguments are present as in (8.46) above (ìggè), then they give additional emphasis to
the pronominal argument (be it focal or topical). In addition, the underived adjective in
(8.50) may behave like a stative impersonal verb when being made causative by adding
object marker.

indefinite place particle ɓo <place.INDEF> and indefinite number word (or indefinite

interrogative derived from the indefinite place particle ɓó <place.INDEF> and from the
interrogative pronoun in nominative case nój ‘who? (singular human subject)’.
Therefore, when one uses ɓónnój for asking questions, one needs to take into account
that one is asking something like ‘where-who’ type of questions, as in (8.50b) above.
409Besides, adjectives derived from stative verbs can be nominalized, and can not occupy
the predicate slot, as in (8.51).

In (11.1c), there is one only way which would help distinguish between comparee and
the standard which is the constituent order, even then it is not totally convincing. Recall
that the index of comparison -ɛ̀sɛ̀n has its own original function as a benefactive marker
‘for, to’. It can be realized as -sɛ̀n when it occurs following vowel-final adjectives, as
in (11.1d).

In (11.2), the index is added to the parameter jel ‘like, love’. Thus, syntactically
speaking, the standard is in peripheral function marked by the postposition ɓó. The fact
is that in Mursi both verbs and adjectives can function as predicate head. The scenario
in (11.2) can be further justified by the fact that in comparative constructions, only
adjectives can function as parameter of comparison. The other interesting comparative
construction of a mono-clausal type comes when comparing two items that are almost
equivalent in the parameter of comparison. In this case, two adjectives will be utilized,
― one to be used as a parameter of comparison and the other as a modifier of the
standard within an NP, as in (11.3).

Thus in (11.3) ɓó is a modifier of the standard, which is an NP in its own.
The most interesting of all mono-clausal comparative constructions is the acquisition
of a superlative reading when the standard is plural. Unlike other languages, for instance
497English where the superlative adjective modifies the head noun within an NP plus the
definite article the, Mursi never changes the syntax of comparative construction in order
to form a superlative construction.

Regarding superlative constructions, Dixon (2012: 364) noted that many languages
express the superlative by using a comparative construction where the standard may be
specified by quantifies such as ‘all’. Mursi adheres to this according to Dixon’s
statement, which means that syntactically both comparative and superlative
constructions remain the same except for minor adjustments on the standard (as in
(11.4a-c)). The sole difference between the two types of constructions is that the
standard in the superlative is being made plural instead of other forms. In (11.4d) below
it is a relative clause which consists of the parameter of comparison busɛn ‘bigger/est’
and the standard ŋaiggɛa ‘these’. It appears that the relative clause is a modifier of the
comparee ina. The copula complement jela ‘love’ refers to the compare ina ‘one, that’.

11.3 Phrasal plus mono-clausal construction
The main reason for the term ‘phrasal’ used here instead of just bi-clausal is that both
the COMPAREE and the STANDARD OF COMPARISION can be conjoined by the phrasal
coordinative conjunction particle kó, for they often form a phrase. Here, one important
point that we must take into account is that the conjoined elements labeled as comparee
and standard only refer to the participants, otherwise there is no means to distinguish
between the two participants, at least at this stage, unless one of them is re-mentioned
in the clause. There are two types of phrasal plus mono-clausal comparative
construction strategies: (i) one that contains no copula verb and which looks like a
single clause, and (ii) one that has a phrase and a copular clause. Both strategies do not
make use of the benefactive suffix -ɛ̀sɛ̀n as a comparative degree marker. Illustrations
of both types are presented as follows (Mütze 2014):

‘The leopard is faster than the elephant.’
(Lit. ‘from the elephant and the leopard, the leopard is fast.’
As seen in (11.5a), the comparee and the standard of comparison are conjoined by the
phrasal conjunction kó ‘with’, and both are topicalized elements. The parameter that
follows the phrase has lost its adjectivizer suffix -i because it is neither in a copula
complement position nor is it a full-fledged parameter. Since almost all Mursi
499adjectives are derived from stative verbs, it is not uncommon for adjectives to behave
like verbs. Two proofs for this assertion are, (i) the deletion of its adjectiviser suffix,
and (ii) the post-verbal marked-nominative case suffix on the comparee.
However, the suffix can also function as a focus marker. In (11.5a), the crucial point
seems to be the way the comparee is distinguished from the object. The first and
foremost answer to this will be a language-specific strategy. Individual languages may
have their own information structuring strategies and one of which is the strategy they
employ for comparative constructions. Besides, two genuine answers are presented, ―
one hypothetical but depending on the way the language tend to arrange constituents in
a clause, and the other depending on the structure in (11.5b). With regard to the first,
the participants are already mentioned first. Thus, due to this discourse context in place,
repeating the standard seems irrelevant and therefore it has been omitted. In addition to
this, had ŋɔ̀rɔ̀ been the comparee, it wouldn't be marked for nominative case. This is
due to the fact that nouns that have ɔ-final roots can be marked for nominative case by
reduction of the same vowel (/ɔ/). The second explanation is based on the principle of
'more adjacent' to the mono-clausal construction where the participants and other
constituents are syntactically placed (as in (11.5b). Accordingly, from the two
conjoined participants in the NP, čár is adjacent to the copular clause, so it is the one
being picked for copula subject position. Additional examples of the first type is given
below (Mütze 2014):
(11.6)PARTICIPANTSPARAMETERCOMPAREEa. [múwáj

hírí-ɔ́
woman
PCN man
big
man-NOM/FOC
‘The man is bigger than the woman.’
(Lit. ‘(from) the woman and the man, the man is the big one.’)
This is a more similar comparative construction to (11.5b) but containing a different
index hɛ́tɔ́ ‘same as, similar’. This applies if both comparee and the standard are
500equivalent in value. Indeed the example in (11.7) is one that shows comparison of
equality.

same
‘S/he is about my age.’ (Lit. ‘S/he and me, (our) years are the same.’)
As can be seen in (11.7), a statement of equivalence can be achieved in the same way
as a comparative construction with phrasal plus copula clause technique, i.e. by
conjoining comparee and standard participants as a single NP, and by incorporating
the parameter and the index in a copula clause.
11.4 Bi-clausal construction Type I
Bi-clausal comparative construction Type I can be expressed by using two copular
clauses for comparative constructions and three copular clauses for superlative
constructions. The fact is that the parameter of comparison remains the same in all
clauses but can be modified by one or more degree intensifiers. Type I bi-clausal
comparative constructions have the following templates:
(i){[STANDARD1]CS [PARAMETER1]CC}CLAUSE1
{[COMPAREE1]CS [PARAMETER1]CC INDEX1} CLAUSE2….comparative construction(ii){[STANDARD1]CS [PARAMETER1]CC}CLAUSE1

As it is shown in (11.7), the bi-copular clauses can indicate a comparative construction;
where the first clause only contains the standard and the parameter while the second
clause often contains the comparee, parameter and the index of comparison. The same
syntactic construction applies to a superlative construction, as we saw in (11.8). Two
major differences have been noted between the comparative in (11.7) and the
superlative (11.8), ― the superlative construction requires three copular clauses and
two index markers.
There is also another form of comparative construction that involves two copula
clauses but requires the use of two semantically opposing parameters (adjectives), as in
(11.9).

As Dixon (2012: 359) states, this type of comparative construction can be called a
‘comparative strategy. A language called Alamblak (a Sepik Hill family, Papua New
Guinea) has similar comparative construction to the one illustrated in (11.9) (p. 359).","[519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525]"
"Person cannot be indicated or marked on the verb in the imperative form whatsoever,
even when two coordinated imperative forms occur in one construction. Some
examples are illustrated below.

‘Go (pl.) see the cattle!ʼ
The most interesting point in (7.38b) is that it is not clear why the singular form of
root aib [w] ‘go/come’ is used instead of hóɗ ‘come (pl.)’.
Pronominal object suffixes can be cross-referenced on the imperative verb form but is
depending on the transitivity nature of the verb. If the verb in the imperative form is
transitive, an object pronominal can be marked on the verb directly. If the verb is
333ditransitive, there is no marking on the verb but just a free personal pronoun follows
the imperative verb form.

‘Kill (sg.) the man!’
Third person object marker is not marked on the imperative form of the verb, as can be
seen in (7.39a). No mention of third person as direct or indirect object not even by a
free pronoun, as shown below.

imperative form, as in (7.40c). In fact, (7.40c) would have a different form for a
reflexive or declarative sentence (7.58d).
c. áín-ɛ́

In order to make a command to an addressee that also involves a reflexive pronoun, an
intransitive verb is preferred over a transitive. The intransitive process verb ér ‘die’
will be used instead of the transitive action-process verb éʤ ‘kill, shoot’.","[356, 357]"

This is a grammar of Mursi (ethnologue code ISO 639-3 muz), a Surmic language which
belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family. This grammar is the first detailed
description of Mursi language written based on an immersion fieldwork in the villages
of the Mursi community between 2017 and 2019. Consequently, a considerable amount
of examples incorporated in this grammar came from the data collected during the two
years which mainly include an extensive corpus of texts from different genres. This
grammar is also based on a linguistic analysis theoretical framework called Basic
Linguistic Theory (BLT). Following BLT, this reference grammar has incorporated
fourteen chapters covering the phonology, morphology and syntax of the language. The
result is thus a full documentation for the speakers of this little-known language. It is
also a valuable source material for linguists and anthropologists who are interested in
ethnocultural documentations, and for typologists who are interested in the areas of
descriptive and comparative studies of the Surmic Group languages.vTable of Contents

numbering around 7,500 (Population Census Commission, 2007), who live in the
Lower Omo Valley (5° 20' N and 6° 14' N), Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples
Regional State (SNNPRS), Ethiopia. The Mursi are called by alternative names: Murzi,
Murzu, Murutu (see Map 2), Meritu, Dama, and Mùnɛ̀n. The Amhara (the so-called
highlanders or kúchúmbáj by the Mursi) call them Mursi and their language mursiɲa.
Their southern neighbors (the Nyangatom) call them ɲikalabɔŋ1 and their nearest
neighbours the Bodi (Me’en) call them Dama. However, the Mursi2 call themselves
mùn and their language mùnɛ̀n. They speak Mursi (Ethnologue code ISO 639-3 muz),
a Surmic language which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family. Their territory

Although (4.8) is a type noun modification construction which requires further marking
both on the head and the modifier, only the head is marked with a construct-form suffix.
The bound deictic circumclitics have restricted the noun from inflecting for further
grammatical roles. In (4.8), the modifier ŋamɔra is in its canonical place, and has a role
seemingly modifying the noun in construct-form/relator suffix, but, its role is just to
refer to a specific item or what body part of the calf is being referred to.
A head noun inflected for deictic elements can only be modified by a possessive
pronoun or by a possessive NP. See the following two examples.

referring to the quantity instead of the price. The difference between these two
meanings of the question word ísɔ̀ŋ ‘how many’/’how much’ requires further study. If
the question is presented as in (12.24b), the possible replies would involve a lexical

During my long corpus collection in the Mursi community, one important point that I
(12.25) a.learned from Mursi speakers is that their preference for specific types of grammatical
constructions out of many other types mostly depends on stylistic and ideolectal
differences. For instance, (12.25a1) is more preferred than (12.25a2). In addition to
‘how many’, using ísɔ̀ŋ, one can ask questions such as ‘how much’ and ‘how old’.

12.2.6 nɛ̀ŋ and nój ‘who’
The interrogative pronouns nɛ̀ŋ and nój refer to the identity of human referents. The
interrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ can occur in O function either following a main verb or a
copula verb. There are two main syntactic slots in which nɛ̀ŋ occurs: direct object of a
521transitive verb and extended argument of a ditransitive verb. nɛ̀ŋ may not be marked
for object case by an overt morphological form because it is inherently an object form
in its own right.

when it occurs in nominative form.

Mursi does not have an interrogative word dedicated for ‘which’. However, nój may
also be used to enquire ‘which’ type of questions. Dixon (2012: 411) noted that ‘who’
can only be used as head of an NP. It could replace ‘which’ as in ‘which X’ if ‘X’ is a
noun with human reference (as in (12.32)).

As it is shown in (12.32a), the number of the referents has been indicated by the verb
to be (also singular existential verb form). Besides, nój is not a modifier since there is
no noun to be modified. However, in (12.32b), the plural specific/relative pronoun is in
a modified form and the modifier could be any noun since the modification/relator
marker attached to it is non-restrictive. Further study is needed to see whether nój is
used to refer to non-human reference.The singular counterpart of (12.32b) is as follows.

Both interrogative pronouns with human referents were used in the above examples.
The function of the interrogative pronoun nɛ̀ŋ in both constructions is simply part of
the language's question construction strategy. Finally, nój may be used to ask about a
non-human referent, as in the example given below.

The suffix -e attached to the interrogative pronoun is unusual and/or has unclear

suffix is attached to the verb.
Note ―I mentioned earlier that Mursi lacks an interrogative word for ‘which’.
Although my position is still the same, two unusual forms that appear to have a
'which' reading have been attested in my data. They are inój ‘which.SG’ and gioj
‘which.PL’. As shown in the examples given below, both interrogative forms can refer
either to a human referent or a non-human referent.

In Turton and Bender (1976: 540), the two have been mentioned as ainoi (singular)
and agyoi (plural). They are alike with the forms in (12.35a-c) despite a slight
difference from Turton and Bender's suggestion. The segment a of the ainoi and agyoi
is a copula verb ― and the final segment is approximant rather than a high vowel.
Despite the fact that in Mursi there are some fused grammatical forms which require
further investigation, in fused form gìój in (12.35b), the form -ój is a nominative case
marker; since it follows the copula verb.
12.2.7 nì and gì ‘whose’
The interrogative pronouns nì and gi are singular and plural possessive forms of ‘who’.
Both nì ‘who.GEN.SG’ and gì ‘who.GEN.PL’ occur in modifier position within an NP.
Consequently, any noun that may replace these two possessive interrogative pronouns
is required to occur either in genitive case form or in possessive form. The head noun
form remains unchanged, ― it always occurs in modified/modification form.

In the examples above, each possessive interrogative pronouns contain two bound
number clitics (as proclitic as well as enclitic) ― in which they indicate only the
526grammatical number of referents (possessors) and the possessed items. They can be
segmented into separate pieces of morphemes. They can even be glossed in almost
equivalent way as possessive pronouns.
12.3 Non-interrogative particles
Non-interrogative particles have different grammatical functions in the language. In
interrogative sentences having non-interrogative particles, the particles (see below in
Table 12.2) can be in a particular discourse context, for instance if the information was
known and in circulation for some time in the past, and/or if the information is believed
to contain hidden facts in a way that creates an exclamative or a dubious situation.

farAs illustrated in (10.47a-b), locative case marking suffixes are attached to nouns
referring to both non-specified and specified/specific static places. The other rare as
well as controversial locative marker is morpheme -ni. At this stage I was unable to
make any assertion about its grammatical status ―whether it is a locative case or some
sort of locative suffix. Last and Lucassen (1998) have claimed that the suffix -ni in Chai
(a dialect of Tirmaga, a Southeast Surmic group language) is a locative particle.
However, Bryant (2007: 42) rejected the claim made by Last and Lucassen. Bryant has
noted that -ni is not a locative particle in Tirmaga rather it has a discourse function on
its own. As evidence for this, he presented -ni which can occur where there is no
anaphoric reference to a previously mentioned location. In addition to this, he also
added that anaphoric references to a previously mentioned locations are found in
Tirmaga without the locative suffix -ni.
Mursi and the two languages mentioned above together constitute a single dialect
continuum, and these languages in fact display almost identical grammatical structure
with Mursi. The evidence stated by Bryant about the suffix -ni as having a discourse
function is plausible, but it cannot prevent the suffix -ni from being a locative marker.
484However, what I have observed in my corpus is that the locative suffix -ni often occurs
on postpositions but it does not occur on simple nouns. See the examples below:

The genitive case in Mursi is a case which is marked on nouns or on any other categories
that modify heads of NPs. In particular, common nouns can be modified by other nouns
with a genitive case form. All the modifying nouns must occur in genitive case form
while the head noun must be marked with a modification form (see Chapter 4; §4.2.3).
The morpheme -ɲ is a general genitive case marker suffix and has a number of other
allomorphs.

Mursi postpositions are monomorphemic particles suffixed with case markers.
Phonologically, they can be made of two types: simple monomorphemic monosyllabic
roots (as shown in Table 10.4 below; from tójé to rɔɲɔ) and monomorphemic roots in
disyllabic CV1CV1C shapes. Note that the syllable shapes of both types were presented
without their respective case suffixes. Some members of Mursi postpositions are relator
nouns and often occur with an oblique case extensions. Postpositions normally occur
in two forms ―as particles and as particle plus suffixes.

negation of possessionMursi, as it is dominantly a postpositional language (except sábɔ̀ ‘front’ both
postposition and preposition; wùrɛ́ɔ́ ‘behind’ prepositions), it does not correlate with
Greenberg’s Universal principle II. Both sábɔ̀ and wùrɛ́ɔ́ are multifunctional words
such as postpositions (following nouns), as adverb or ordinal number (following some
selected verbs), and as preposition (when used as time words). Thus, in relation to noun
and verb modifier, they may occur in different syntactic positions in a clause.
Greenberg’s universal principle II states that in languages with postpositions, the
487genitive always precedes the governing noun (Greenberg 1966: 45). The fact is that
Mursi is a typical postpositional language but the genitive always follows the noun.
However, Greenberg‘s principle 27 highly correlates with Mursi, it says, ‘if a language
is exclusively suffixing, it is postpositional (p.57)’.
With regard to their morphological status, it is not easy to state whether these
postpositions (other than the grammaticalized body part nouns in the form of relator
nouns) were all once independent forms or bound to nouns as the genitive case markers
on dependents.

Furthermore, as shown in (10.52), postpositions may occur with oblique markers (as in
(10.52a-d) or without them (as in (10.52e-f). The co-occurrence of postpositions and
case markers is not always clear. In (10.53a) below, at first glance, the postpositional
particle bàì looks like a verbal word. The fact is that it is not a verbal word, but it may
488be used as a lexicalized verb form ‘to sit’. Even if this is the case, in some previous
linguistic works on Southeast Surmic languages, this particle is mentioned as an
independent verbal word. The verb ‘to sit’ in Mursi can be referred to by the existential
verb íh ‘to exist/(be) present’ with three term root suppletions /changes depending on
person and number. Postpositions can be moved to a clause-initial position when they
occur with negated verbs, as in (10.53a).

Even if the repetition of bai is not clear as in (10.53b), the relational concept of ‘under

expression of the possessive NP (‘your seats’) presents additional evidence to what was
already noted above that bai can serve as the verb (secondary) only when there is no
verb dedicated to the meaning 'sit/stay/exist' in the clause. Therefore, the literal meaning
of ɓáá kɛ̀lčàɲà is ≈ (‘a place for (the purpose of) sitting’) ― (10.53c).

Here, the verb ɛ́l (‘exist.IMPERV.PL’) is prefixed with a passive marker k(V)- and
suffixed with an instrumental nominalizer marker čaɲ. Tentatively, I regard the passive
prefix form k(V)- to be the domain of the emergence of the multifunctional particle
ké/kó (preposition, instrumental, coordinative conjunction, etc.). Note that -ča is a
comitative marker with additional meaning of reason-applicative or purpose. Thus then,489in (10.53c), bàì has a unique postposition function. See further elaborations of the

With regard to the different morphological forms and syntactic position possibilities of
postpositions such that additional spatial relation specification and respective meaning
variation of them appear to be of not much significance. In spite of this solid fact, minor
semantic variations may exist when oblique case marking suffixes are directly attached
to oblique arguments and when oblique case markers attach to normal postposition
particles. For example,

both constitute a single unit, call it a postpositional phrase. An extra spatial relation
meaning in (a) is, that it tells the specific place of the item. In (10.55b), the oblique case
is attached to the noun and appears in its general function. In this case, the oblique case
marker does not supply specific spatial relation information in relation to the exactness.
(10.56) has no oblique argument so the postposition follows the predicate as
complement. The postposition tójé can also mean ‘through/by’ (as in (10.56a-c).

10.5Verb-final suffixIn the attempt to understand how different grammatical constituents interact within
sentences or clauses, we shouldn't forget that some minor but important morphological491forms such as verb-final suffixes that might contribute certain pragmatic and semantic
roles in various types structures in which they occur. The verb-final suffix, an
obligatorysyntacticrequirementforaffirmativedeclarative,imperative,hortative/jussive, and negative clauses, is a morphological element that occurs often on
clause-final intransitive verbs.

relation to some other constituents in a clause, for obvious reasons, there will be no
constituent other than the verb which is to be made a focal element.

it is only the verb-final suffix (focus marker) which is always obligatory especially if
the verb is the sole constituent in a clause.

Comparative construction is a grammatical means of showing two or more items in
order to note similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2012: 343). In order to
make a comparison between two items, there must be at least one quality (essence)
which could be used as a parameter, and that the two items share in common. In other
words, comparing of two or more items involves quality association, an indispensable
approach which would help us to understand where the difference between the items
lies or to what extent/degree the difference between the items in comparison is viable.
One cannot compare two items unless there is at least a single difference in quality
between them, thus the difference comes by means of associating the two items.
As suggested by Dixon (2012: 344), a prototypical comparative construction has
three elements ― the comparison of participants (COMPAREE and STANDARD OF
COMPARISON), the property (PARAMETER of comparison), and the INDEX of comparison.","[506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518]"
"424On the other hand, agentless passive, which is the second type of passive clause
construction in the language, is identical to the prototypical passive type in many
respects, except: (i) the original A argument is not stated in any way, (ii) the form
utilizes bound object pronominal suffixes marking the new S argument, and (iii) the
form takes verb-final suffix. Even though both the A and the O arguments are crossreferenced on the verb in active transitive clauses, only O arguments will be crossreferenced on the verb (derived S arguments). Among Surmic languages, Tirmaga
(Bryan, 1999: 94), and Tenet (Randall 1998: 244), also have agentless passive
constructions. Syntactically, it is clear that it is impossible to express the original A
argument in this construction either overtly or covertly.

PASS-spit/bless.PERV-2pl.OBJ-VFS
‘You (pl.) are blessed.’
As can be shown in (9.4a-c), the bound pronominal suffixes marking O arguments in
c.active clauses are the same as those in passive clause constructions. The third person
has zero suffix realization for bound pronominal marking of the O argument, instead it
takes the suffix -V as O argument marker in agentless passive constructions.

PASS-spit/bless.PERV-3.SU.PASS-VFS
‘He was blessed.’b.kù-tùs-á
PASS-split/bless.PERV-3.SU.PASS
‘They got blessed.’
We can see from the examples illustrated in (9.4) and (9.5) that the first and second
persons utilize the verb-final suffix -ɔ whereas the third person utilizes a different verb425final suffix -ɛ. Rarely, the third person plural form of the agentless passive construction
may not take a verb-final suffix at all (as in (9.5b)).
The agentless passive construction in Mursi and Chai (Southeast Surmic group
language) is the same. Therefore, it is appropriate to cite here one major claim made by
two linguists who studied the Chai language. The following quote is about the agentless
passive construction type in Chai:
‘The logical object, which becomes the grammatical subject in passive
constructions in other languages, remains the grammatical object in Chai, as
the object agreement suffixes are similar to the object suffixes used in active
forms. The verb agrees with the agent in number and person. The agent
normally is not explicitly specified elsewhere in the sentence’ (Last and
Lucassen 1998: 387).
In Mursi, what the verb-final suffixes could indirectly denote is that syntactic elements
are not allowed to follow the agentless passive forms once the verb-final suffixes is
attached to the verb. Even adverbs, which are not part of core or peripheral arguments,
can follow the agentless passive verb form before the verb-final suffix is applied. See
the example given below.

fastAntipassive is another valency-decreasing derivation in which a transitive clause is detransitivized to an intransitive one by an antipassive derivation operation. Antipassive
applies to an underlying transitive clause and forms a derived intransitive (Dixon and
Aikhenvald, 2000:10). In particular in Mursi, a valency decreasing antipassive
derivation is normally used to downplay the core argument of a transitive verb by
omitting the underlying O argument. In this case, Mursi's antipassive construction426adheres to the prototypical patient-like antipassive criteria set by Dixon and Aikhenvald
(2000: 9). The criteria are:

"14.2.3.3 Indirect speech report markers
Indirect speech reports can be intoducded in three major ways: (i) by the quotative ké
(ii) by the subjunctive prefix k(V)-, and (iii) by the speech verb sén ‘say’ being used as
auxiliary verb. This is regardless of optional secondary speech verbs for indirect speech
reports that can be shown by the quotative (also complementizer) marker ké (see
(examples 14.53-14.56). On the other hand, subjunctive mood marker suffix k(V)- is a
default complementizer which is always attached to a perfective aspect verbs, as in
(14.60b).

indirect speech. Consequently as the deletion rule of the language it is only being
applied to some word-final obstruents, the alveolar plosive /t/ is deleted. Note that the
demonstrative that is not a complementizer (or complement clause) marker. The last
indirect speech report marker is the speech verb ‘say’ in which it turns into an auxiliary
verb for the purpose of secondary role as complementizer. Even if unproductive.

The verb ‘say’ in the imperfective aspect can also be used to expresses intention,
perception or curiosity but it may not fully express the state or activity of the clause as
a whole. As can be seen in (14.61b), it can be combined with the adverbial particle ɓòì
‘all, at all, completely’, which is also a marker of completed actions in most cases. The
indirect speech report shown by the auxilary verb complementizer se is the same as
direct speech complement clause. Therefore, the auxiliary verb in the indirect speech
above was used by the reporter to show the perception or intention of the author
(original speaker), (Lit. ‘want(ed) to know’).
14.2.4Complement clausesA complement clause is a type of clause which fills an argument slot in the structure of
another clause (Dixon 2012: 370). A typical complement clause is one that functions596as an argument of another clause ― mostly embedded within the matrix clause.
Complement clauses in Mursi can be shown in the following ways:
i. Complementizer ké §14.2.4.1 (also indirect speech marker, as illustrated in
§14.2.3.3)
ii. ɓá (reason/purposive) marker §14.2.4.2
iii. Apposition §14.2.4.3
iv. Complement-taking verbs §14.2.4.4
14.2.4.1 Complement marker ké
The particle ké is by far the most productive complement marker in the language. As
we have seen in the speech report section, the particle ké is also an indirect speech report
marker.

‘They were so afraid that they cried out.’
ké ɓòì is a temporal or adverbial subordinator marker ‘until’, and it can also indicate
reason ‘since’. Thus, I have interpreted it as reason clause complementizer, as in
(14.62). Accordingly, the consequence clause may come first and be linked to the causal
clause by the causal subordinator ‘since’: ‘They cried out since they were (so) afraid.’
However, a complement clause construction which involves the complementizer ké
could result in a complex construction since it shares certain syntactic similarities with
a relative clause. Compare the complement clause, in (12.63a), and the relative clause
construction, in (14.63b).

‘The man that told you (that) he would lend you money is who?
In (14.63a), the prefix ká which is attached to the verb badar- (a loan verb from
Amharic) carries a high-tone because it is a subjunctive marker. Note that the
subjunctive marker is a complementizer on its own even if it is not productive
(14.2.3.3). Had it been a low-toned prefix, it would then indicate first person subject
and it would result in another meaning (‘Who told you that I would lend you money?’).
In the relative clause construction shown in (14.63b), all constituents other than the
subject and interrogative word (copula complement) are within the relative clause that
operated by the gapping-strategy. In the absence of the relative clause, the construction
in (14.63b) would mean hírá á nɛ̀ŋ? (Lit. ‘The man is who?’). The complement clause
embedded within the relative clause may still be accessible whenever it is needed for
further purposes.

"5.7 Predicative possessive construction
A possessive relationship can be established within a clause, in the form of predicative
possession (Aikhenvald 2013: 27). Predicative possessive construction in Mursi can be
expressed by the verb lɔ̀m ‘have/hold/grab’ (§5.7.1), existential verb íh ‘exist’(§5.7.2),
and an invariable copula verb á <COP.3.IMPERV> (for both singular/plural) (§5.7.3).
5.7.1 With the verb lɔ̀m ‘have’
The verb lɔ̀m ‘have’ is a transitive verb, has no perfective form and can never be used
in command and passive constructions. A possessive construction produced with the
help of this verb may be translated as in English ― RA have/hold/grasp DO (cf. Dixon2422010: 299) (where subject of the transitive verb lɔ̀m (A) is the same as the possessor
(R); and the object (O) is the same as the possessed (D)). The possessed noun can be
any simple or derived noun or any possessable object in O slot.

5.7.2 With the existential verb ih ‘exist/present’
The verb of existence has four different roots, each of which comes carrying a
grammatical information such as person and aspect. What makes the existential verb
different from the verb ‘have’ is that the verb ‘exist’ is an intransitive verb used with D
in S function, and then the R becomes a peripheral NP often marked by the
preposition/comitative particle kó ‘with’ or oblique case marker -ɔ/-je attached to D. A
positive existential possessive predication will have the following schema: D exists
with R or D exists for R, as in (5.46-5.49).

These existential possessive predication constructions shown above can be expressed

5.7.3 Using a copula verb
Possessive relationships can be expressed with a copular construction (Dixon 2010:
302; Aikhenvald 2013: 29). The copula verb in Mursi inflects for person and number,
and alters its root form for aspect. However, a possessive relationship through a copula
construction can only be shown by one specific copula verb form, i.e. the third person
imperfective form á <COP.3SG/PL.IMPERV>. Accordingly, a possessive relationship
construction using this copula verb may yield the schema: D (copula subject) COPULA
VERB R (copula complement).","[265, 266, 267, 268]"

nouns3.2.2VerbsA verb in Mursi can make up a full-fledged complete sentence. Such a sentence can
have two objects when a ditransitive verb is being used. Verbs have up to fourteen slots
for verbal grammatical categories. Of these, three are prefixal slots while the rest are
suffixal. Mursi verbs obligatorily are inflected for bound pronominal S/A and O
arguments (participant reference), aspect, mood, motion/direction, valency-changing
derivations, and negation (see §7.3.1 of Chapter 7).
Valence and negation are discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 12 respectively. Except
for tense and reflexive action that are expressed by separate grammatical words, all the
other components of non-spatial and spatial setting in Mursi are expressed in the
inflectional system. Moreover, two verbal grammatical categories ― causative and146negation have double markings. The former may be shown by circumfixes while the
latter by circumclitics.
Interestingly, there are a few instances in which the size of the morphological
categories which a single verb root can take, and the syllable shape of the verb root
itself correlate. For example, monosyllabic verb roots usually take as many inflectional
categories as they can. Disyllabic verb roots take less inflections compared to
monosyllabic verb roots. There are a dozen trisyllabic verb roots which take fewer
morphological categories. Ideophone-like verbs may take just one, or sometimes may
not take any verbal morphological categories at all. They rather use auxilary verbs in
order to indicate grammatical information they carry.
However, as exceptions, there are a few monosyllabic and disyllabic verb roots
which take a prefix and just one or two suffixes at a maximum. Verbs such as élí ‘call’,
the auxiliary verb sé ‘say’, an existential verb íh ‘exist, present’, the verb lɔ̀m ‘have’
and polysyllabic ideophone-like verbs are among those that take few inflectional and
derivational categories (see §7.2 and §7.3 of Chapter 7). Although phonological
features cannot serve as criteria to distinguish the verb class from other word classes,
certain phonological features are confined to only verbals. For example, the majority of
Mursi verbs have monosyllabic CVC consonant-final roots. In addition, full suppletion
of roots for a particular grammatical category is a sole feature of the verb class (see
§7.3.1.2.2).
Mursi has also five inherently number-determined verb roots: áʤ ‘give’, kún ‘come,
bring’, ɔ́k ‘go’, íh ‘exist/present’, and ésé ‘sit’. Plural arguments involved in these verbs
are: O arguments for first verb while S arguments for the rest four verbs. All five of
these verbs distinguish aspect by multiple root alternations. That means that each of
these verbs undergo three to four root alternations (§7.3.1.2.7).","[168, 169, 170]"

Unlike in declarative sentences in which both subjects of intransitive and transitive
verbs are obligatory marked on the verb, imperative sentences always drop markers of
both subjects. In addition, in Mursi, both subject and the object of a transitive verb are
cross-referenced on the verb. Semantically, object of a transitive verb and the recipient/
beneficiary of a ditransitive verb are regarded as primary object, thus, they are crossreferenced on the verb. In the positive as well as negative imperatives, subject of any
337transitivity class is not required, only object arguments are obligatorily marked on the
verb.

There is also an interesting interaction between imperatives and adverbial words (time
and locative). Time words (adverbs) often occur at the beginning of a declarative
sentence.

"547With regard to these negative relative clause formations and the semantics which can
be associated with them, the following points need to be taken into account:
(i)Since Mursi is a language that has no grammatical gender, gender related
constructions can be substituted by appropriate nouns or natural gender
displaying words. Thus hírí ‘man’ in (13.25a) may refer to both genders but
it usually refers to a masculine ~<3sg.M>. The noun hòja ‘female’ in
(13.25b) displays feminine ~ <3sg.F>. In fact, hírí alone may be used to refer
to a male referent.
It can refer to a female referent when some natural gender referring nouns
are attached to it. The other justification may be the fact that personal
pronouns cannot be modified (maybe only if they are in relative pronoun
forms).(ii)In order to be modified, the head noun must occur in noun modification
form by carrying appropriate restrictive marker which signals that the
modifier should also have the same form. Thus, both the head and the
modifier relative clause must carry a restrictive modification marker suffix
-a. In a modifier relative clause, the restrictive marker suffix -a not only
functions as restrictive modification marker but also functions as verbal
nominalizer. As can be shown in the above examples, it always attaches to
the right edge position of the verb root.(iii)The restrictive modification plus nominalizer marker -a will always changes
the verb into participle form and the entire construction into nominal phrase.(iv)Subjunctive forms in Mursi always can come in the irrealis mood, therefore,
the verbs always have a perfective aspect. Besides, first and third persons in548the subjunctive forms are shown by k(V)- prefix. As usual singular number
is being shown on the verb itself, whereas plural number is marked by [t/ɗ].
(v)NP heads in demonstrative constructions can be modified but they do not
take a noun modification marker suffix -a, they are already in modification
form. Due to this, the restrictive modification/nominalizer cannot be
attached to the perfective negative verb root (as in (13.25c)).","[570, 571, 572]"
"In addition, the causative suffix -ísí has three allomorphs: -ísí following consonantfinal verb roots; -sí following vowel-final, fricative/liquid/nasal-final verb roots, and
-s for some verb classes to be identified.
Syntactic function of the causative application in Mursi is to derive a transitive
clause by applying morphological causative derivational markers to an underlying
intransitive clause. As Dixon (2012: 240) described it, the argument in underlying S
argument goes into O function in the causative. A new argument (also known as the
causer) is introduced in A function.

the S of (9.56a) can be either sátíní búsísíó ‘big box’ (9.56b) or éróá sábí gɛ̀rsà
‘students of bad character’ (9.56c). The S of (9.57a) and (9.58a) are érmì and hírí
consecutively. One important point that I noticed from the causative derivation
examples illustrated above is that it seems to be the case that the third person

spirit-OBLAs mentioned earlier (see morphophonemic rule(s) in Table 9.5), the complete vowel
assimilation rule often applies to verb roots whose first syllable carry /ɛ/ and /u/ vowels.
In fact, the morphophonemic (the complete vowel assimilation) rule is similar to vowel
height harmony. For example, the causative marker prefix í- assimilates to [ɛ] (9.60a)
and to [u] (9.61b).

b. súr

due to the formal morphological technique for deriving a causative construction, it is
plausible to imagine that such morphophonological process/rule (e.g. vowel height
harmony) could have contributed to the obsolete old causative prefix *ɪ-/í-.
Furthermore, as far as other Surmic group languages is concerned and my
understanding of the language I worked on for some years (Mursi), such
morphophonological process not only contributed to obsolescence or archaism of this
prefix but also to the emergence of many verbs whose underlying intransitive forms
(non-causative) later became V-initial verbs (with causative meanings).","[469, 470, 471, 472]"

"3077.3.1 Verbal inflection
Mursi verbs are mainly inflected for bound pronominal S/A and O arguments
(participant reference), aspect and mood (AM), motion/direction, valence, and
negation. Valence and negation are discussed in chapter 9 and chapter 12 respectively.
7.3.1.1 Participant reference
Participant referents are cross-referenced on the verb. In SCHEME II and throughout this
grammar, the term ‘participant reference (markers)’ and ‘bound pronominal (markers)’
have been used interchangeably. Thus, all the bound pronominals: S (subject of an
intransitive verb), A (subject of a transitive verb), and O argument markers are crossreferenced on the verb. The bound pronominal markers of the S/A arguments are
different for imperfective and perfective aspect. Even within the perfective aspect, they
display distinct suffixes on the basis of realis and irrealis moods.

viewed within one grammatical reality of an event ‘realis’ and both are marked by
distinct bound pronominal S/A argument suffixes. As Dixon (2012: 22) points out,
‘realis refers to something which has happened or is happening’. Thus, within the
framework of Dixon’s ‘realis’ as a reality bounded by time of an event, it is possible to
link the grammatical meaning of Mursi realis mood into: temporal perfective (as an
event happened), and simple perfective (in general has no reference to temporality).
Bryant (2013:60) has made similar S/A distinctions for Chai (Suri) language for what
he called the temporal perfective (usage in non-narrative) and simple perfective (usage
in narrative).

the temporal and simple perfective come from the first person plural inclusive and the
third person plural subject bound pronominal S/A argument suffixes. With regard to
simple perfective in Chai (Suri) language, Bryant (2013:61) noted that the first person
plural inclusive and the third person plural subject suffixes copy the vowel of the
preceding verb root. Vowel copying is not the case in Mursi, even if there is some sort
of segmental resemblance between the simple perfective subject suffixes and the vowel
of the verb roots. The subject suffix –Vɛ <1pl.INC., 3pl.> that occur only on the simple
perfective forms of verb seems to have phonologically motivated variants, as shown in
Table 7.23 and 7.24 below.

utilizes distinct bound pronominal S/A argument suffixes. Dixon (2012: 22) points out
that irrealis denotes two situations: ‘something which has not (yet) happened’ and
‘something which did not happen in the past, but might have’. See further discussion in
§7.3.1.3.4.
The fact is that both realis and irrealis operate within the aspect system of the
languages, which is independent of a tense system. The main reason I distinctly treated
the term subjunctive within the irrealis mood is that it has a separate lexical word in
addition to the subject markers that indicate a subjunctive construction.

"13.8 Tracing and linking negators
While different types of negators constitute the negation system of the language, it is
yet possible to trace the origin of the form which recurs in some of the negative
particles. Some of the negator forms are attested in a number of Surmic group languages
while few forms were also attested outside the group. In view of Mursi negators, there557is relatively compelling evidence in the negator proclitic ŋà= which in one way or
another is the origin for the rise of the following independent negative forms:
(i)/ŋàánó/ ~ [ŋà=Ɂán=ó] (see §13.9). The same morphological process, cliticization,
should have applied to Chai verbs because Chai has almost identical
morphological verbal negation process to Mursi. However, Last and Lucassen
(1998) didn't adequately describing the exact morphological process that has to
be employed in the negation system of the Southeasten Surmic languages. Due to
this, in their grammatical sketch of Chai language, the negator enclitic =ó has
been presented as being a final suffix -o.(ii)/ŋànì/ may well be reconstructed from the negator proclitic ŋà= and the
imperfective copula verb an <COP.IMPERV>. The morpheme i which occurs
following the copula could possibly be a singular number marker ― ~ [ŋà=án-i].
The existence of i possibly as a sole singular number marker suggests that the
particle has no self-standing form and cannot be inflected for further grammatical
categories including for plural number.(iii) The negative existential-locative imperfective verb /níŋɛ̀/ has the same forms for
third person singular and plural. It perhaps developed from the locative suffix ni
added to the negator proclitic ŋà= and the singular positive existential verb /íh/
<exist.SG.IMPERV> which always has [i] realization due to recurrent deletion of
glottal fricative /h/ word-finally ― /h/ ~ Ø.
Finally we will get a form níŋai [ni-ŋà=i] <LOC-NEG=exist.IMPERV:SG> which I
believe developed into a fully fledged verb form níŋɛ̀ ― ‘x’ at/in is not
present/exist’ or ‘x’ not at/in ‘y’ or ‘x’ without ‘y’. But what we cannot be certain
of is that it can inflect for person like any other regular verb. Contrary to the
claim made above, this suggest that níŋ could be a root form rather than a derived558form from different grammatical categories. An in-depth study is required in
order to identify its actual form. Last and Lucassen (1998: 420) claimed that níŋɛ̀
would perhaps be a negative copula. It is a hypothesis that makes sense until
disproved by new evidence.
(iv) The contrastive clause marker particle ŋànìjè looks like a derived form because
the form in itself gives a hint it may be from ŋànì and from the subordinate marker
enclitic =jè. Also, in most cases, the element that follows this contrastive
marker is the main clause.
Therefore, in all negator forms listed above, there is one constant form recurring, i.e.
/ŋa/ ~ [*ŋa/*ŋà=/*ŋ/. In fact negators have not been given proper place and attention
by some Surmic language investigators. Due to this, a number of inconsistent and
incoherent negator markers have been reported in different literatures.
For instance, the Mursi main negators ŋà= and =ó undoubtedly have clitic status while
in Chai (another Southeastern Surmic group language), ŋa has been reported as an
independent particle (Last and Lucassen 1998: 418). Last and Lucassen also reported
another independent negative particle ŋásò. However, such form has not been found in
my corpus so far, despite it being an acceptable morphological form in Mursi. If any
such form exist in Mursi, it is undoubtedly reconstructed from two clitics ― the negator
proclitic ŋà= and from floating emphatic enclitic =so.","[580, 581, 582]"

‘blessing’. It is the suffix -a, with an attributive function, that helps the nominalizer
provide a full-fledged meaning. Note that there is a distinction between (3.52b) and
(3.45a), even if both may convey a comparable semantics. In principle, the one in143(3.52b) can be changed into agent noun by a noun modification construction ― hírá

H. Zero-marked nominalization
The final de-verbal nominalization type involves zero derivation. In other words, the

deverbal nouns include modifier within NPs and complements in clauses.

1443.2.1.3.9 Summarizing the noun class
In a summary, three grammatical properties have been employed to define the various
subclasses of nouns: morphological, syntactic and semantic.
To sum up the discussion of the largest open word class in the language, it is also
important to rewind the three grammatical properties employed to define the class. As
can be shown in the summary Table 3.4 below, Mursi nouns were divided into eight
subclasses based on the semantic properties they display. In addition, although there
are up to twelve nominal morphological slots in general, the majority of them can take
three major morphological categories: number, case and demonstrative deictics. Not all
of them have the same morphological capacity with regard to taking certain inflectional
elements. For example, the subclass of compound nouns do not take any morphological
inflection except number. But on the other hand simple nouns can take up to four
inflections at a time. Similarly, the syntactic functions they may possess and the
functional slots they occupy within phrases and clauses vary according to their
subclasses. The noun subclasses and its syntactic functions and functional slots are
summarized in Table 3.4 below.","[165, 166, 167, 168]"
"6.10 Reduplication
Reduplication is not a productive morphological way to indicate grammatical number
in Mursi. However, reduplication may be a semi-productive way to indicate plural
number on the two underived adjectives. As it can be shown in the examples below,
plural forms of the two underived adjectives of Mursi is shown by reduplication.

The Mursi have a fully inflected verb toj ‘count’ which they often use to count heads
of cattle. This is related to decisions usually made by informants pertaining to the
distribution of bridewealth of counting at least 37 head of cattle. This will be undertaken
with a tally counting ―usually using small stones or pebbles.
Mursi has a ten- based number system, also known as ‘decimal system’. See §3.3.1.1
for a full list of Mursi number words. Unlike some Surmic languages, number words
one to ten are non-loan ones. In addition, unlike some Surmic languages, Mursi does
not form number words six to nine by combining the lower numerals and the quinary
form (five as the base). For number words higher than ten, a combining tɔ́mɔ́n ‘ten’,
hírkón ‘twenty’, etc and number words one to nine are used together (see §3.3.1.1 Table
3.12). The particle kó ‘and’ functions as a conjunction particle to connect two number
words and form a number word that is higher than them. The number word for ‘twenty’282hírkón is a compound word derived from two words: the noun hírí ‘man’ and the
indefinite number word kón ‘one’ (Lit. ‘One man/person’; referring to ten fingers and
ten toes of one man). Therefore, the number word ‘twenty’ and the multiples of 'twenty'
do not require the conjunction particle kó (see Table 6.4 below). The number word for
‘hundred’ has two forms ―the Mursi form zùwò háánán (Lit. ‘five people’) and the
Amharic form matto <mäto>.

There is a clear difference between the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j and kón ―not only in the
way they are combined with other number words but also in the way they modify nouns
within NPs. As we recall from Chapter 4, when nouns are modified by number words
higher than two, they do not take modification or dependency markers (restrictive
and/or non-restrictive), as in the following examples.

However, the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’ stands apart from the rest of number words
because it triggers the head to be marked with a non-restrictive modification marker.
In an NP where ɗɔ́nɛ́j is the modifier, regardless of the head's word class status, the
non-restrictive modification marker -i/-ti must be attached to the singular head (6.76ac).

From the example in (6.77), one can easily understand that there were some other men,
at least more than two.
On the other hand, the indefinite marker/word kón ‘one’ can function alone or be
combined with other nouns. When combined with nominals, it usually yields indefinite
pronouns (see §3.3.1.5, Table 3.7). Both ɗɔ́nɛ́j and kón may function as a modifier
within an NP. Interestingly, the head modified by kón does not take any modification
marking, however, kón itself as a modifier can take another modification marker (-a or
-o).

For example, ɗɔ́nɛ́j may occur in a reduplicated form and be used with the plural form
of ‘belly’ kɛ̀ŋì in order to create a distributive meaning. In contrast, kón cannot be
reduplicated but can take other morphology for example the restrictive modification
marker. In simple clauses, kón can function as S argument while ɗɔ́nɛ́j cannot.
Nevertheless, ɗɔ́nɛ́j has at least one role in clauses, a copula complement. In Table 6.6
below, a brief comparison between the number word ɗɔ́nɛ́j and the indefinite word kón
is presented as follows.

6.11.2 Deriving ordinal number words
With regard to the development of ordinal numbers, Dixon (2012: 74) stated that in
many cases they are derived from their cardinal congeners. Mursi has three ordinal
numbers. Of these, two of them are derived from lower cardinal ràmàn ‘two’ and sízzí
‘three’. Thus, the ordinal number ‘second’ and ‘third’ are formed by attaching the
morphological marker suffix -nè to them ― ràmàn-nè <two-ORD> and sízzì-nè
<three-ORD>. Examples were given in §3.3.5.1. Additional examples are presented as
follows.

‘And on the third day he shall rise.’a. nàIn order to create an innovative form of ordinal number higher than ten, one should
attach the ordinal number marker suffix -ne to the smaller cardinal number on the right
edge (cf. p179). However, at this stage, it only applies to one ordinal number form
higher than ten, i.e. ‘twelfth’, as in the following examples.

Copula verbs in Mursi share a number of morphosyntactic properties with regular verbs
and occupy the verbal position like any other verb in the canonical constituent order CS
COP CC. However, when copula verbs function as predicates in a copular clause, theybear a number of special semantics associated to their syntactic position. The
morphological property of copula verbs is discussed below. Copular clause is discussed
in Chapter 14. Except for third person, copula verbs are also inflected for person and
number like regular verbs.

form of the imperfective aspect while te ‘was, became’ is the base form of the perfective
aspect. We know that the third person singular subject suffix is not marked on verbs in
the imperfective aspect. In such cases, there may be a possibility of deletion of the
base's final segment (alveolar nasal) word-finally, i.e. /an/ ~ [a]. However, this only
makes sense for the third person singular form of the imperfective aspect. Interestingly,
when the third person form is negated the real form emerges. Compare the following
examples:

‘They are not’As we see (7.28b2), the negated form of the third person copula verb is the real form
and it occurs as ŋàánó [ŋàɁánó]. The glottal stop /Ɂ/ is often epenthesised between a
proclitic that ends with a vowel and a root that begins with the same vowel. Whereas in
(7.28c2), the copula form ŋàájó often occurs in free and lexicalized form and there is a
tendency to epenthesise the palatal approximant /j/ to block a sequence of three vowels
when segmenting is required. In fast speech, however, only ŋàjó is recognized and it327can be used as independent (free-form) negative copula word/particle denoting a
meaning ‘not, it is not, are not’7.3.1.2.10 Auxiliary verb
In a number of Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic languages of Ethiopia, the verb ‘say’ has
wider functions among which is that it can be used to derive verb idioms and can be
conjugated with other verbs as an auxiliary verb. Apparently, similar functions of the
verb ‘say’ are attested in some Nilo-Saharan languages of Ethiopia, at least in the
Southeast Surmic group ― Mursi and Suri (Chai-Tirmaga-Me’en). The verb sén ‘to
say’ appears to be the base form in the imperfective aspect. It is inflected for bound
pronominal S/A and O arguments but it doesn’t take full verbal inflections. For
example, it cannot be negated and used in imperative construction. When an imperative
form is needed, there is another verb which substitutes and is used to deliver a
command, i.e. ― jog ‘say, speak, tell’.

cases, they are often marked for person and number of the subject while the main verb
that follows can be fully marked for the necessary agreement inflections. The semantics
associated with auxiliary verbs include the expression of desire, intent, perception,
uncertainty and so on.

number by reduplication of the cardinal number ɗɔ́nɛ́j ‘one’. To produce a distributive

Within NPs, number agreement between heads and modifiers is obligatory. Modifiers
within NPs take an obligatory number agreement marker. In addition, obligatory
number agreement within NPs depends on the modifier of the head. If the head is289modified by bound demonstratives, the number is already an inherent part of the head
noun itself, as in (6.89a).

The noun bì ‘cow’ is used to refer to cattle in general of both genders. Thus it displays
