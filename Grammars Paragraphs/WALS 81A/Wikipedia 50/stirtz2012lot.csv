‘The Baggara (people group) were kidnapping young girls.’ (Minj2)As shown in (5), verb complements—objects and indirect objects—immediately
follow the verb, and adjuncts follow verb complements. Adverbs are least
connected with the verb and the most moveable of the adjuncts, sometimes being
fronted before the verb, although not usually before the subject. When more than
one kind of adverb is present, manner and directional adverbs normally precede
adverbs of place, time, and other adverbs. Negation markers can be analyzed as
adverbs, since they follow the verb and its adjuncts and have the same function as
adverbs. They are always sentence-final and cannot be fronted before the verb as
some adverbs can.

Verbal clauses with underived verbs can be transitive, intransitive or dative (threeargument). The intransitive clauses of (7) have the subjects as their only argument.
Intransitive verbs are not uncommon in Gaahmg.

a recipient or beneficiary in a clause requires the presence of an agent or experiencer
and patient or theme. In other words, a dative cannot be present without a subject
and object. The dative verbs attested are /gàf /‘give’, /bɛ̀ɛ ̀ / ‘tell, say’, /bàg/ ‘bring’.

Although there is no morphological distinction between transitive and intransitive
verbs, there are four valency-decreasing morphemes and one valency-increasing
morpheme attached to verbs. The functions of each are shown by the examples in
following sections.","[282, 283, 284]"
"5.1Person and number markersPronouns in Gaahmg, regardless of case or number, use vowel features to represent
the person referred to. Depending on the type of pronoun, the vowel may be either
[+ATR] or unspecified for [ATR], and the three persons coincide with the language's
three vowel harmony pairs as shown in (1): [+back, -round] vowels represent first
person, [+round] vowels represent second person, and [-back] vowels represent third
person. Pronouns are marked for plural number agreement with the velar geminate
segment -gg-.

3rd personThe abbreviations used for pronouns are as follows in order of appearance: 1, 2, or
3 refers to person; s or p refers to singular or plural person number; P, N, A, D, R, O
refers to possessive, subject (or nominative), object (or accusative), dative, reflexive,
or prepositional case (object of a preposition); and in possessive pronouns, final s or
p refers to singular or plural noun agreement. For example, the pronoun máà ə́əǹ (è)
‘my (1sPs) house’ indicates the first person singular possessive pronoun agreeing78A grammar of Gaahmgwith a singular noun, and the pronoun máàgg ə́nə̀gg(ə̀) ‘my (1sPp) houses’ indicates
the first person singular possessive pronoun agreeing with a plural noun. For
reference, the list of table 7 presents the most basic pronoun forms of this chapter.","[78, 79]"

The certainty of an action taking place is marked in the clause rather than on the
verb. There are two degrees of certainty or evidentiality for both completive and
incompletive verbs.
The normal completive form by itself is a statement of certainty. It states that it is
certain the action is completed. Uncertainty in the completive form is indicated by
the particle lā and optionally by the clause-final subordinate clitic =É. Both
degrees of certainty in the completive are shown in (59).

before the subject pronoun.
Similarly, the incompletive verb by itself is also a statement of certainty. It states
that it is certain the action is ongoing or for certain will be ongoing. Adding the
uncertainty particle lā before the incompletive verb or attaching the clause-final
subordinate clitic =É indicates uncertainty in the future. With either marker, the
other marker is optional.

14.9.1 Word order in the noun phrase
The noun phrase can be diagrammed in the order of (65). The head noun is followed
by an optional possessive pronoun (POS), and one or more optional adjectives. More
than one adjective in the same noun phrase is rare and no prescribed order in the
noun phrase can be determined. It is also possible for demonstratives (DEM) to
precede alienable possessive pronouns. The possessors of inalienable nouns—
kinship terms and body parts—precede the possessed noun, and the possessors of
alienable nouns follow the noun.
(65)Noun phrase word order
NP->(POSInalienable)N(POSAlienable)({DEM, NUM, ADJQuan, ADJQual})The adjectival clause of (66a) shows a noun phrase with three adjectives—a
demonstrative, numeral, and adjective of quality. The possessive pronoun ə́nə̀gg=ə̀
‘mine=COP’ is a noun phrase complement of the non-verbal adjectival clause and the
copula clitic is attached. In (b), the second singular possessive pronoun ɔ́ ‘your’
precedes the kinship term yáā ɲāā ‘aunt, younger mother (lit. mother girl)’—a
compound noun phrase, which is followed by a demonstrative.

(d), the third plural possessive pronoun ə́nə̀gg ‘my’ follows the plural alienable noun
bààlgā ‘instrument’. A demonstrative, possessive pronoun, and quantitative
adjective are all present in the same noun phrase, where the demonstrative precedes
the pronoun, possibly being fronted for emphasis.
Constructions with relative clauses are preferred above long noun phrases with
multiple adjectives. In (67), the relativisor nà begins three separate relative clauses.

Adjectives, possessive pronouns, and demonstratives agree with nouns in number.
Agreement is marked by the geminate velar segment gg or tone change. The plural
adjective suffix -gg is shown in (68a-b) and the possessive pronouns ə́nə̀gg and

There is morphological marking in subordinate and interrogative clauses, and a
discussion of sentence-level syntax is needed to understand these morphemes. In
this chapter, we discuss types of clauses in sentences (15.1), coordinating and
subordinating conjunctions (15.2), interrogative structures (15.3), as well as focus
(15.4).","[301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"

Focus is constructed by fronting the constituent which the speaker deems as the most
important bit of information for the clause. Both subjects and objects can be fronted
in focus.
Normally, prepositional phrases used as adjunct conjunctions such as ɛ̄ mūn náán ‘at
that time’ occur sentence-initially or following a conjunction.

(17). In this concluding sentence of a narrative where a fox and hyena try
throughout to capture and eat him, the devil creature is fronted in order to emphasize
him as being the victor.

most important, by fronting it. The noun subject Fə́nd̪ì-n which normally follows
the subordinate conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ is sentence-initial.

‘When Fandi fought with the government, . . ’ (Fand1)Objects are brought into focus by moving them to a pre-verbal position. The object
mii-n ‘chicken’ in (19) is out of its normal post-verbal position to emphasize that it
is the ‘chicken’ being thrown away and not the ‘goat’.

sentence. The meaning is ‘It is those kinds of women and not others whom God
blesses.’

passive clitic attached to the verb. The sentence of (21) is the concluding remark of
a personal story where a creature repeatedly tries to attack the narrator and other
participants. The construction emphasizes the outcome of the object ɟāām
‘someone’ (‘no one’ with negation).

Gaahmg is a morphologically rich language, employing many suffixes and clitics on
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. [ATR] quality and tone distinguish a significant
number of lexemes and grammatical functions. Several specific processes of
consonant weakening, vowel elision, [+ATR] spreading, [+round] spreading, and
morphological tone rules, account for the vast majority of alternations when
morphemes are combined.
Gaahmg suffixes differ in alternation and function from clitics, where the former are
mostly inflectional morphemes which attach to underlying root segments, whereas
the latter are mostly functional, derivational or clausal morphemes which attach to
surface stem segments.
All pronouns except interrogatives use vowel features to represent the person
referred to, the three persons coinciding with the language's three vowel harmony
pairs. Nouns may attach singular and plural suffixes, although plural suffixes are by
far more common, and have various segmental and tonal allomorphs which mostly
have no semantic correlation with the nouns to which they attach. Nouns and
adjectives attach one or more of seven clitics to the stem, each with segmental or
tonal allomorphs which depend on the stem-final segment.
The verb has five morpheme slots in addition to the root. Antipassive and causative
morphemes attach immediately following the root, followed by modal and aspect
morphemes which are also included in the stem. Derivational, pronominal, and
clausal clitics attach to the verb stem, many of which have various segmental or
tonal allomorphs depending on the subject person or inflectional verb form to which
they attach. Gaahmg has morphological marking for both perfect and imperfect
aspect, which can both attach to completive and incompletive verbs. Tone is added
to verb stems for subject person inflection, tone distinguishes past from non-past
tense in the continuous form, and tone replacement is used in the formation of
antipassives, causatives, and verbal nouns.
Prepositions, body part locatives, adverbs, and conjunctions are distinct lexical
categories. Body part locatives are similar in form and meaning to inherently
possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category in that they do not
refer to person and have different tone than body part nouns. Although they are
separate morphemes, some of these locatives undergo the same segmental and tonal
alternations as clitics, depending on the final segments of the preceding noun of
reference.
Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb forms are
syntactically and morphologically distinct and combine in nearly all possible ways.","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318]"

The negative particle wá always occurs clause-finally and modifies or negates the
preceding verb, verb predicate or clause. Since neither its position nor function
differs from adverbs, the negative particle can also be analyzed as an adverb. As in
(14a), the negative particle occurs as the last word of the verb phrase and may be
separated from the verb by verb complements or adjuncts. The negative particle
may also negate an adverb of manner as in (b) or a prepositional phrase functioning
as an adverb as in (c).

14.1IntroductionIn the previous chapters, various morphemes have been shown to be distinct in form.
We now present many of the same morphemes in their syntactic context to show
their function. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb
forms are shown to be syntactically distinct. In non-verbal clauses, copular clitics
are shown to take the place of separate copula particles, which are functionally
equivalent but different in form. Relative clauses are morphologically marked for
definiteness and grammatical function, and they receive the marking instead of the
head noun they modify.
In this chapter, we first discuss grammatical function of constituents in 14.2 and
word order in 14.3, then verbal clauses in 14.4 and verbal valency in 14.5, followed
by non-verbal clauses in 14.6, relative clauses in 14.7, evidentiality in 14.8, and
finally noun phrases in 14.9.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

10.10151IntroductionGaahmg (Gaam, enthologue code [tbi]) is a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language
spoken in the Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan, near the
Ethiopian border. For centuries, the Gaahmg people have fought off invaders
entering their hills. Even today, their culture and language have been less influenced
by outsiders than those of other ethnic groups in the Blue Nile Province. Although
Gaahmg speakers outnumber speakers of other languages in the area, little
documentation has been done of their language. This work presents a description of
Gaahmg grammar, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

somehowPronouns89When both the object and dative object are pronouns, the dative pronoun commonly
follows the object pronoun and can be separate or attached. When attached, the
dative pronoun can be attached directly as in (27b) or n can be inserted between then
as in (c). In (d), the object pronoun follows an attached dative pronoun, but the third
singular object pronoun has a different form [=ÉÉn (which becomes =íín through
[+ATR] spreading) instead of =E (3sA) or =EEggÀ (3pA)]. An object can also
follow a dative pronoun by having a prepositional prefix d̪- as will be shown in (31e)
of 5.7 and is then a prepositional pronoun instead of an object pronoun.

In (28), the full paradigm of suffixed dative pronouns is shown attached to a
completive verb. The completive verb without the dative pronoun and object are
shown in (a), and the paradigm with dative suffix, assuming the same noun object, is
given in (b). In (a), the root vowel surfaces as ɔ, but in (b) becomes u with the
attached [+ATR] dative suffixes {M3}. In such examples, the vowel of the
completive suffix does not surface, as suffix vowels are elided by the initial vowel of
following suffix, as stated by the verb elision rule of {M1} in 3.1. Other dative
pronoun paradigms on verb forms are shown in 10.8.

to the subject. In (29a, b), the reflexive indicates the object which is the same90A grammar of Gaahmgreferent as the subject. However in (c), the reflexive meaning is extended and the
reflexive is used as a repeated object for emphasis. Instead of referring back to the
subject, it refers back to the object. In (29c), the plural noun ɟɔ̄gg ‘people/officials’
and the third plural reflexive ììŋg are objects of the verb máð ‘refuse’. The noun
ɟɔ̄gg represents the government and is emphasized with the reflexive, possibly
because of previous bad encounters with them. Reflexives are not found to be used
as repeated subjects.

‘He refused (to give money to) the officials by fighting.’ (Fand4)Reflexive pronouns are based on the inherently possessed word for ‘body’, which is
VVŋ, where V is the person marker vowel. As discussed in 5.2.4, the word for body
and a few other nouns cannot occur without possession using one of the person
marker vowels. With such words the norm is for [-ATR] vowels to indicate singular
persons, and for [+ATR] vowels as well as the plural suffix -gg to indicate plural
persons. However, all reflexive pronouns are [+ATR], and the suffix -gg as well as
Low tone indicate plural agreement.

3pRPrepositional pronounsPrepositional pronouns are objects of prepositions, or for another reason are prefixed
by the preposition marker d̪-. The prepositional prefix takes the place of the general
preposition ɛ́, í (GP) as in (31a-b) when introducing prepositional pronoun objects
The second pronoun ɛ̄ ‘he’ in (c) is the only occurrence found of a post-verbal
subject pronoun. Perhaps it is repeated for emphasis or there is an implied unstated
verb ‘to give’ of which ɛ̄ ‘he’ is the subject pronoun.
21Pronouns91(see 11.4). However, the prepositional prefix is used in addition to an adverb
functioning as a directional preposition such as d̪ūmùùn ‘towards’ in (c). It is also
used in addition to the animate accompaniment preposition ɛ ‘with’ and
accompaniment clitic =E᷇ on the pronoun as shown in (d). The marker is also used to
introduce verb objects when separated from the verb by a bound dative pronoun as
in (e) or by other verbal suffixes.

‘in order to completely cut the people’Word structureBefore beginning morphology discussion on various word categories, it is important
to define how a word boundary is determined and how the terms ‘root’, ‘stem’ and
‘word’ are used in this thesis. The morphemes attached to roots and stems have
different functions, different morphophonological alternations, or in other ways are
treated as different kinds of morphemes in the language.
Word boundaries are determined by [+ATR] spreading. A word involves all bound
morphemes to which [+ATR] quality spreads; with the exception of a few
compounds (see footnote 8 in section 2.2.2.2), all vowels of a word have the same
[ATR] quality, all being either [+ATR] or all being [-ATR].
A root is the smallest lexical morpheme of a word and can be the entire word. A
stem is a root plus an optional suffix and can also be the entire word. A word
includes the stem and any optional clitics.
(27)Stem = root + (suffix)
Word = stem + (clitic) + (clitic)All suffixes of the language are a part of the stem and all clitics in the language are
outside of the stem, but inside the word. More than one clitic in the same word is
possible, but only one suffix is possible in a stem.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72]"

Second and third person object pronouns are clitics attached to verb stems, whereas
first person object pronouns are analyzed as separate morphemes since they do not
undergo changes in [ATR] quality. As presented in 5.4, the unmarked object
pronouns are relisted in (27). Several person object pronouns have tonal allomorphs
which are discussed in the following section on object pronoun tonal morphology.

3pAFirst person pronouns have back unrounded [-ATR] vowels which do not become
[+ATR] regardless of the root they follow. Thus they are analyzed as separate
morphemes. When first person object pronouns follow verb stems with suffixes
such as the completive forms cɔ̄r-sá ‘help-COMP’, cúr-sú ‘tie-COMP’ of (28), the
stem-final vowel is elided and the tone of the verb root spreads to the object
pronoun, just as if the first person object were a clitic as the other object pronouns.
In 12.1, it is shown that independent body part locatives sometimes have elided
vowels and tone changes similar to clitics. The first person object pronouns are no
more unusual in their alternations than these body part locatives.

grammatical agreement with the subordinate clause in which the noun referents are

genitive case which is marked by a tone change. In such clauses, the semantic
patient or theme (syntactic subject), encoded as a noun in (a) or pronoun as in (b), is
pre-verbal.

In each of the clauses of (32), a third singular subject is combined with a third

plural combinations of subjects and objects shown in the chart to follow. In (a), the
subject verb form has no object pronoun, in (b) the verb has an unmarked object

with their referent; the segment -gg- marks the plural object (bɛ̀l-d̪=ɛ̄ɛḡ gà
‘beat=3sN/3pA’, bɛ̄l-d̪=ɛ̄ɛg̀ gà ‘beat=3pN/3pA’). The different tonal allomorphs of
the objects predictably attach to different subject forms as further described in
10.4.2. In marked third object pronouns, the segment -gg- marks the plural object
(bīl-d̪=ììggə̀ ‘beat=3sN/3pAM’, bìl-d̪=íìggə̀ ‘beat=3pN/3pAM’) as well as a
singular object combined with a plural subject (bīld̪=īìggì ‘beat=3pN/3sAM’).
Again, the different tonal allomorphs of the objects predictably attach to different
subject forms. Syntactic pronoun subjects of agented passive clauses have the same
form as subjects of active clauses [ɛ̄(ɛ̄n) ‘he (3sN)’, ɛ̄ggà ‘they (3pN)’]. They are
independent and agree in number with the referent. For these pre-verbal patients or
themes, the agented passive verb clitic =E᷇ marks that a singular agent comes after
the verb and the suffix =ÉĒ marks that a plural agent comes after the verb.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"
"20A grammar of GaahmgIn chapter 9, the verb stem is discussed which is composed of the root and optional
slots for antipassive, causative, and modal or aspect morphemes. Aspect is marked
segmentally in the verb word—by completive and continuous suffixes. Past tense is
marked by tone on the verb stem—High tone on the non-past continuous suffix and
MH tone on the past continuous suffix. Infinitive, subjunctive and imperative forms
also add suffixes to the root. Deictic suffixes for each verb aspect and mode are also
attached to the root. Finite verb forms are inflected for subject person by tone added
to the stem-final syllable: High tone in third singular verbs, Low tone in third plural
verbs, and Mid tone in first and second person verbs. Chapter 10 discusses the
clitics of the verb word, including agented passive, passive, object and dative bound
pronouns, imperfect, perfect, subordinate, and relative clause definite marker clitics.
Clause-level syntax is presented in chapter 14 to show the functions of morphemes.
Agented passive, passive, antipassive, and causative morphemes are syntactically
distinguished in a section on verbal valency. Non-verbal clauses with two sets of
copulas are compared. Relative clauses, noun phrase agreement, and possession are
also discussed, among other grammatical aspects. Chapter 15 presents sentencelevel syntax, including coordinate and subordinate conjunctions, question clauses,
and subject and object focus. After some concluding remarks in chapter 16, ten
texts of various genres are presented in chapter 17 to verify the morphology and
syntax in the context of natural language.
All data represent both underlying and surface (phonetic) forms unless otherwise
marked. Where they differ, surface forms are written between brackets [ ], whereas
underlying forms are written between forward slashes / /. Many of the clause
examples are taken from the ten texts of chapter 17, which have reference codes.
Throughout the thesis, examples from these texts list the reference code and line
number in the free gloss from which the examples are taken. Pronouns, as in ūgg
ŋə̀lg ‘your (2pPp) necks,’ have a different set of gloss abbreviations than other word
categories (see the list of abbreviations and the discussion on possessive pronoun
abbreviations in 5.1).
Example numbers are indicated with parentheses such as (3), whereas rules are
indicated with braces such as {M3}. In 3.3, rule {M4} states that [+round] quality
spreads rightward from the root to all suffix vowels not underlying specified for the
feature [round]. However, roundness does not spread as specified in every word
with every speaker, but tends to vary from word to word and from speaker to
speaker. In this thesis, morphemes are transcribed as having the most possible

Nouns function as subjects, objects, indirect objects, or objects of prepositional
phrases. In (1), mɛ̀ɛn̄ ‘youth’ has the role of agent and functions as the subject of
the clause. The noun nāmsá ‘food’ has the role of a theme, functioning as an object,
whereas mə̄əð̄ ə́n ‘grandfather’ is the recipient and indirect object.

‘The youth leader bought the food for the grandfather.’Case marking does not occur on subject or object nouns, but dative nouns take the

root tends to be monosyllabic, with optional onset and coda. The verb stem is
composed of the root, and optional slots for antipassive (ANTIP), causative (CAUS),
and modal or aspect morphemes. The verb word is made up of the stem and
optional slots for agented passive (PAS.A), passive (PAS) or bound pronoun, and
imperfect (IPF), perfect (PF), subordinate (SBO1,2), or relative clause definite marker
clitics (RDM).
(1)Verb root = (C)V(C)(C)
Verb stem = [Verb root] + (ANTIP) + (CAUS) +
({INF, SBJV, IMP, COMP, INCP, CONT, IMP.D, COMP.D, CONT.D})
Verb word = [Verb stem] + ({PAS.A, PAS, PRON}) + ({IPF, PF, SBO, RDM})The verb word is further represented in table 32 by the order and options of each
position or ‘slot’, where each item in the column is an example option. The
morphemes are briefly explained following the table, after which, a few examples
are given in (3).

When a verb is marked as having no object, it attaches the antipassive suffix -An,
which precedes any other morphemes (9.10). Causative suffixes -s+A, -d̪+A have
[+ATR] quality which spreads in both directions in the verb word (9.11).","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174]"
"775PronounsThe pronoun system in Gaahmg distinguishes three persons, two numbers (singular
and plural), and six cases (possessive, subject, object, dative, reflexive,
prepositional). There is no dual, no gender distinction, no inclusive/exclusive
distinction, and no logophoric distinction. As expected in an SVO language, subject
pronouns are pre-verbal and object and dative pronouns are post-verbal. Possessive
pronouns are pre-nominal for inalienable nouns and post-nominal for alienable
nouns. Prepositional pronouns have the prepositional marker prefix d̪- and reflexive
pronouns make use of the possessed noun ‘body’.
There are two distinct ways that pronouns affect verbs through [ATR] quality:
second person subject morphemes require verb forms to have [+ATR] vowel quality
as discussed in 5.3, and dative suffixed pronouns spread [+ATR] vowel quality
leftward onto the verb root {M3}, as discussed in 5.5.
The six types of pronouns are each discussed in their own section, but first, an
explanation is needed for the vowel-person correspondence in all pronouns.
Interrogative pronouns are not discussed in this chapter, but in 15.3 in the chapter on
sentence level syntax.","[77, 78]"
"15.1 Clause combinations
Clauses may be nuclear (main, independent), pre-nuclear (dependent clause
preceding a nuclear clause), or post-nuclear (dependent clause following a nuclear
clause).
As in (1a), foregrounded nuclear clauses of narrative texts most commonly use
infinitive verbs. However, in non-fiction narratives, a completive verb is also
common, as shown in (b).

big.sizePre-nuclear clauses are introduced with subordinate conjunctions, the most common
of which is the conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ which often introduces tail-head linkage.
In the second line of (2), the subordinate clause refers to ‘an arrival at the well’
implied by the previous nuclear clause, before continuing with the next nuclear
clause in the third line. In this way, the subordinate clause links new information
with old information contained in the subordinate clause. The verbs of tail-head
linkage are most commonly completive verbs, but can also be incompletive or pastcontinuous.

the nuclear clause. A further subjunctive clause (ā mād̪ɛ ́ fɛ̄gg ‘to drink water’) is
found in the first two lines of (2). Clauses may also be embedded such as the clause

DEF15.2 Conjunctions
Conjunctions are a further lexical category, introducing either nuclear or non-nuclear
(subordinate) clauses. The coordinate conjunctions of (4) are found to introduce
nuclear clauses. Some references in texts from chapter 17 are listed for theSentence-level syntax309conjunctions. In addition, it is also possible to juxtapose nuclear clauses without any
conjunction.

The verbal clitic =E᷇, =ÉĒ indicates a third person agent (or experiencer) encoded
post-verbally in a prepositional phrase or in genitive case. The clitic agrees in
number with the encoded agent when in genitive case but not when in a
prepositional phrase. The clitic is called an ‘agented passive (PAS.A)’ marker in this
thesis. It is commonly used when patients or themes are in focus, being pre-verbal.
In agented passive clauses, an explicit agent is required and the encoding of the
agent is required to be post-verbal. Further, the agent is marked as a non-argument,Verb word morphology215demoted to a prepositional phrase as in (a) or in genitive case as in (b), and thus no
longer the syntactic subject. The clauses of (c-d) have singular and plural agents
encoded in post-verbal positions, where the clitics =E᷇, =ÉĒ agree in number with
the agent. However, the clitic =E᷇ of (4a) does not agree in number with the plural
agent káɛ́ggà ‘witchdoctor’ in the prepositional phrase.

‘The branch was broken by the

syntactic subject, evidenced by the pronoun taking the same form as the third person
subject pronoun (of active verbs) which can be short or long.

‘The cow was struck.’Only third person agents can be encoded post-verbally and clauses such as ‘*The
person gave me.’ with a first person pre-verbal pronoun are not possible. Thus,
there are only two agented passive markers. In addition, only third singular patients
or themes are possible in agented passive clauses and not clauses such as ‘*I am
needed by the hunter.’ Agented passive clitics are also discussed in the section on
verbal valency in 14.5.1.
Table 46: Agented passive clitic
Third singular subject =E᷇
Third plural subject
=ÉĒ10.2.1 Agented passive segmental morphology
Agented passive clitics are attached to verb stems. When the root is stem-final, such
as in incompletive forms, no segments are elided, even if the stem is vowel-final. In
this case, the clitic is juxtaposed to the stem (pāā.=ɛ᷇ ‘guard=PAS.A’) in accordance
with {M2} of 3.1. However, final vowels which are not part of the root, such as
suffix-final vowels in completive and subjunctive plural forms, are elided by the
initial vowel of agented passive clitics (cɔ̄r-sɔ́ ‘help-COMP.3sN’, cɔ᷄r-s=ɛ᷇ ‘helpCOMP=PAS.A’), in accordance with {M1} of 3.1.
In (7), third singular incompletive forms with agented passive clitic =E᷇ are shown
with various root-final segments. The clitic attaches to the surface-final segments of
the incompletive form rather than to the underlying form, as seen by the long vowels
in (c, h, o-p) when the clitic is juxtaposed to open syllables. In (b-c, l-m), the rootfinal segment can optionally surface as a vowel or an approximant.

The agented passive clitic =E᷇ has underlying HM tone. In (8), it is attached to third
singular completive and incompletive verbs, and in (9) it is attached to third singular
continuous past verbs. In completive and incompletive forms, the initial High tone
of the agented passive clitic becomes Mid following root-final Low tone {M9} as in
(c,d,f). For unknown reasons, completive and incompletive forms with Mid root
tone melody and agented passive clitic have MH tone on the root as in (8b), but not
in continuous past forms with Mid root tone melody as in (9b).

syllables of suffixes, Mid tone is inserted between them on the first of the two
syllables. Thus, Mid tone is added to the continuous past suffix in (9b,c) but not on
other forms where there is an initial Mid or Low tone preceding the High on the
continuous suffix.

In contrast with the agented passive of 10.2, which always has an explicit agent in
the clause, the passive of this section never encodes an agent. Passive and active
forms are compared in (12). In the normal SVO word order of active transitive
clauses such as (a-b, d), the noun preceding the verb is the subject and agent. In (b),
the L-M tone (with L-H becoming L-M by {M9}) of the completive form indicates
the third singular subject while L-L tone would indicate a third plural subject. In
passive clauses such as (c,e), the clitic =ĀnÁ indicates that an implied agent is
absent from the clause. In that case, the patient (syntactic subject) normally
precedes the verb as in (c) but may follow the verb as in (e) and in (13). The clitic
=ÁnÁ attaches to stems with vowel-final suffixes such as the completive forms of
(c,e) and the clitic =Á attaches to stems with consonant-final suffixes such as the
continuous past form of (13) and to suffix-less stems.","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"

In this thesis, the term ‘perfect’ discussed in 10.8 is used for verbs with a past or
present action that remains or results in the present or future. The imperfect is
simply the counterpart of such verbs. Namely, imperfect verbs indicate that a past
or present action does not remain or result in the present or future. It should not be
confused with imperfective aspect, which in other languages indicates an ongoing
process. In (54a), the subjunctive imperfect verb indicates that although the goat
will drink water, he will at some time become thirsty and need to drink again. In
(b), the continuous past imperfect verb indicates that at the time the narrative takes
place, the Baggara had horses, but may no longer have horses at the time the
narrative is told. There is similar meaning for the incompletive imperfect verbs of
(c-d). In the interrogative and declarative clauses in hortatory genre of (e), the
incompletive imperfect verbs are used as habituals.

The subordinate marking in the clause occurs along with these conjunctions as a
clitic on the verb, or clause finally, or both. It is more common for the conjunction
ār ‘if’ to be absent from the clause than to be present, although there is subordinate
marking regardless. As shown in 10.7, the verb-final subordinate clitic attached in
‘if’ clauses differs in tone from the clitic attached to verbs of other subordinate
clauses.
In (5c), the conjunction wàr ‘but’ occurs along with the verb-final subordinate clitic
=ī (SBO3). In (d), the conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ occurs along with the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) and the clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO). In

Questions are constructed using the question marker à or an interrogative pronoun.
Only the interrogative pronouns of (6b-e) agree in number with the noun phrase
which they replace. Some interrogative pronouns have a marked form when they
replace words which occur in an uncommon position in the clause, but are otherwise
unmarked. Other interrogative pronouns only have one form regardless of its
position in the clause. When any of the interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, the
clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) of 7.7 and 8.3.8 attaches sentence-finally.
When an interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) of 10.7 is attached to the verb.

and plural stated patients or theme (syntactic subjects). In passive clauses, only third
person patients or themes are possible; clauses such as ‘*I was struck’ are not
possible.
Third person dative or object pronouns can be attached to passive verbs. A dative
pronoun attached to a passive verb as in (14a) refers to a beneficiary or recipient 35,
whereas an object pronoun as in (b-d) refers to a patient or theme. The dative
pronoun alone can represent a recipient as in (a) and the object pronoun alone can
represent a patient, or the pronouns along with a noun reference can represent these
roles as in (b-c). In 5.3, it was mentioned that subjects of active clauses can include
both a noun and pronoun reference in the same clause, the pronoun added for
emphasis such as for switch reference from a different participant. Syntactic
subjects (recipients, patients) of passive clauses can also include both a noun and
pronoun reference for emphasis, such as for switch reference in (b) and salience in
(c). The kāsā-gg ‘boys’ of (c) is salient in that the theme of the hortatory text is
tying (or training) boys in the customs appropriate for manhood.

stem. First person object pronouns are analyzed as separate morphemes since they
remain [-ATR] regardless of the quality of the root to which they follow. Most
objects have more than one tonal allomorph for different subject person verbs to
which they attach. Tone of object pronouns is discussed further in 10.4.2.

3pAThere are two types of third person object pronouns, although the exact distinction
in function is not clear. For lack of better terms, they are called ‘marked (AM)’ and
‘unmarked (A)’ object pronouns in this thesis in accordance with their distinction in
vowel quality. The unmarked third person pronouns of (18) are unspecified for
[ATR], the same as first and second person object pronouns, and the marked third
person pronouns of (19) are [+ATR]. As with unmarked object pronouns, the
marked pronouns have more than one tonal allomorph for different subject person
verbs to which they attach. These are also further discussed in 10.4.2.

not all in the same order as in previous sections. The verb stem suffixes discussed to
this point have no underlying tone except for the past continuous suffix -A᷄n with
MH tone, the non-past continuous suffix -Án with High tone, and the imperative
suffix -Á with High tone which attaches to a few imperative verbs.

In all finite verb forms, Mid tone is assigned to the stem-final syllable of first and
second person forms, High tone is assigned to the stem-final syllable of third
singular verbs, and Low tone is assigned to the stem-final syllable of third plural
verbs. Thus, although many of the inflectional verb suffixes have no underlying194A grammar of Gaahmgtone, tone is assigned to the suffixes according to these tonal inflections for subject
person agreement.

singular forms becomes Low when following Low tone, as in (c,d,f). High tone
assigned to the suffix in third singular forms becomes Mid when following Low tone
in (c,d,f). These processes are in accordance with the tone lowering rule {M9} of
3.4.3. Low tone assigned to the suffix in third plural forms causes the root Low tone
melody of (c) to be come Mid, in accordance with the raising rule {M8} of 3.4.2. In
(e), the Mid tone of the HM root tone becomes Low in accordance with the lowering
rule {M7} of 3.4.2.

reasons. Suffix Mid tone in first singular and second plural forms assimilates to
root-final Low tone {M9}, as in (c,d,f). Suffix High tone in third singular forms

subordinate forms. First singular Mid tone assimilates to root-final Low tone {M9},
as in (c,d,f). Third singular High tone becomes Mid when following Low tone
{M9} in (c,f). Third plural Low tone causes the root Low tone melody of (c) to
become Mid {M8}, and in (e) the Mid tone of the HM root tone becomes Low
{M7}. For unknown reasons, final High tone in third singular forms with Mid root
tone melody as in (b) does not surface. However, when a vowel-initial clitic with
no underlying tone is attached such as the second person object pronoun =O, the
clitic surfaces with High tone (cɔ̄r=ɔ́ɔń ). When the third singular High tone is
added to incompletive forms with HL root tone melody, the combination HLH tone
surfaces as HMH tone in accordance with the combination rule {M10} in 3.4.4.

MH-MHMIn High-initial two tone root melodies such as (40d-e), the second tone of the
melody surfaces on the suffix, delinked from the root. However, in other root
melodies, the root tones remain assigned to the root. When three tones surface on
the past continuous suffix such as in (a,e,g), High tone is lowered to ‘half High’
pitch, being one of three tones on a mid weight syllable, similar to tone of the
accompaniment clitic =E᷇ described in 7.6.2.
In the third singular forms of (41), High tone is assigned to the end of the continuous
suffix -A᷄n (MH), which already has final High tone. In (c,d,f), the initial Mid tone
of the suffix -A᷄n assimilates to the preceding Low tone {M9}. In (d), the resulting
H-LH becomes H-MH {M10} when the third singular object =E᷇ with HM tone is
attached, and in (f), the underlying tone surfaces unchanged when the third singular
object is attached.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198]"

A Grammar of Gaahmg, a Nilo-Saharan Language of Sudan
door Timothy M. Stirtz
1. In Gaahmg, personal pronouns use vowel features to represent the person referred to,
the three persons coinciding with the language's three vowel harmony pairs.
2. Gaahmg has body part locatives which are similar in form and meaning to inherently
possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category. Unlike inherently
possessed body part nouns, they do not have person reference and differ in tone.
3. Gaahmg has morphological marking for both perfect and imperfect aspect, which can
both attach to completive and incompletive verbs.
4. In Gaahmg, tone replacement is used in the formation of genitives, antipassives,
causatives, and verbal nouns.
5. A fortis/lenis consonant contrast in word-initial and intervocalic position is common
in Southwest Surmic languages (De Jong 2004:145), but the word-initial contrast
does not exist in the Surmic language called Laarim (Narim) of Sudan.
6. There are five case suffixes in Laarim (Surmic) which have polar tone—opposite
tone from the stem-final tone.
7. Lumun, a Niger-Congo Kordofanian language of Sudan, uses pronouns and noun
concord reference to distinguish one participant as being more important than another.
8. In Lumun narratives with one participant being more important than all others, the
centers of orientation for direction words are locations that change according to the
movement of that participant.
9. It is ideal and possible to both analyze an African language and train speakers in the
grammar of their language at the same time.
10. Linguistic analysis of African languages opens new doors of amazing beauty which
inspires a person to look more outside himself at the world around him.","[352, 353]"

or vowel-approximant constructions which surface as vowel-vowel sequences. The
bilabial and palatal weakening rule of {P1b} states that the underlying plosives /b/,
/ɟ/ and approximants /w/, /y/ are weakened word-finally to vowels with the same
[ATR] quality as the preceding vowel. Unambiguous word-final vowel sequences
such as in būə̀ ‘tree type’ support this analysis, as does the fact that different
allomorphs of the accompaniment and definite clitics attach to stem-final vowels
rather than to stem-final consonants.
In (27), singular nouns and their accompaniment and definite forms are given.
Accompaniment singular nouns take the clitic =E᷇ for surface-final consonant stems
as in (a) and the clitic =nĒ for surface-final vowel stems as in (b-d). The language
treats (b-p) as having vowel-final stems and attaches the clitic =nĒ. Similarly, the
definite clitic =A for surface-final consonant stems attaches in (a), but definite
clitics having final n for surface-final vowel stems attach in (b-p).
There are no noun suffixes with initial consonant which attach to both underlyingfinal consonants and underlying-final vowels. Therefore, the root-final plosives /b/,
/ɟ/, and /g/ never surface as plosives as they do in verbs (/cág/, cáá ‘bathe.INCP.3sN’,
cág-gággā ‘bathe-COMP.D’). In nouns, there is no way to verify whether the rootfinal segments are underlyingly /w/ or /b/, /ɟ/ or /y/. However, although the definite

The suffix of (a) has no underlying tone, allowing the plural form to surface with
Low tone, the same as in the root. Whereas, the suffix of (b) has underlying Mid
tone and the suffix of (c) has underlying High tone. As will be shown in section
6.3.1, there are seven other noun plural suffixes with two or three tonal allomorphs,
most of which are not semantically or phonologically predictable with the root.

grammatical distinctions made only by tone in nouns and verbs. Grammatical tone
distinguishes bound morphemes with different grammar, or is a morpheme in itself,
either added to or replacing underlying stem tone.
Tone distinguishes bound morphemes, such as the copular and definite clitics of
(41). The copular singular clitic =Ā which takes the [ATR] value of the root has
underlying Mid tone, the copular plural clitic =À has underlying Low tone, and the
definite clitic =Á has underlying High tone.

10.7Where tone is a morpheme in itself, it can be added to segmental forms or can
replace the underlying tone of segmental forms. Tone is added to distinguish subject
persons of verb forms and to distinguish future and non-future subject pronouns.
Tone replacement is used for genitive case, plural person possession of body part
nouns, antipassives, causatives, and verbal nouns.
In verbs, tone marks subject person agreement by being added to the stem-final
syllable. As shown in (45), tone distinguishes third singular and third plural subject
verb forms from other person forms. The verb root of (45) has underlying High tone
and the completive suffix -sA has no underlying tone. In such verbs, high tone is
assigned to the stem-final syllable of third singular forms, Low tone is assigned to
the stem-final syllable of third plural forms, and Mid tone is assigned to the stemfinal syllable of first and second person forms.

(16). As in nouns, the adjective stem consists of the root and an optional plural
suffix. The adjective word consists of the stem and optional slots for copula,
definite, locative, dative, accompaniment, subordinate, and relative definite clause
marker clitics.
(16)Adjective stem = root + (PL marker)
Adjective word = [ADJ stem] + ({COP, DEF, LCM, DAT, ACM, SBO, RDM})Plural formation of qualitative adjectives is similar to that of nouns in that adjective
roots attach the segmental suffix -gg with more than one tonal allomorph.","[156, 157]"
"174A grammar of GaahmgThird singular and first, second, and third plural subjunctive (SBJV) forms are
distinguished from first and second person singular forms by the suffix -d̪A (9.3).
Imperatives (IMP, IMP.PL) addressed to more than one person are distinguished from
imperatives addressed to one person by the suffix -d̪+A (9.4).
Aspect is marked segmentally in the verb word—by the completive (COMP) suffix
-sA in (2a) and the continuous suffixes -Án/-A᷄n in (b-c). Past tense is marked by
tone on the verb stem—High tone on the non-past continuous (CONT.N) suffix -Án in
(b) and MH on the past continuous (CONT.P) suffix -A᷄n in (c). Future tense is
marked by tone outside the verb word on the subject pronoun—High tone on the
non-future subject pronoun á in (d) and HM on the future subject pronoun a᷇ in (e).

‘I will bury the egg.’Aspect is divided into completive and incompletive action. As mentioned,
completive verbs are marked by a morpheme (9.5). There is no incompletive (INCP)
morpheme, but in the absence of all aspect or mood morphemes, ‘incompletive’ is
the interpretation of the verb form (9.6). The incompletive can be specified as
continuous, thereby taking a past or non-past suffix (9.7). Deictic (D) suffixes such
as -CÁggĀ, -(CAg)gAn, -(CÁg)gĀ, -d̪úū indicating direction and distance also
attach to the root (9.9).
Agented passive (PAS.A) clitics =E᷇, =ÉĒ, often used in clauses with object focus to
indicate a post-verbal encoding of an agent (or experiencer), agree in number with
the agent (10.2). The passive (PAS) clitic =ĀnÁ attaches to stems with vowel-final
suffixes whereas =Á attaches to stems with consonant-final suffixes and suffix-less
stems (10.3). Object pronoun (ACC) (10.4), dative pronoun (DAT) (10.5), imperfect
(IPF) (10.6), and verb-final subordinate (SBO1,2) (10.7) clitics indicate person and
number. The relative clause definite marker (RDM) agrees in number with the
nominative person form (10.9). A perfect (PF) bound morpheme -CAr, =Ar, =r can
attach to nouns or verbs and can have various allomorphs for various verb forms.
Although the morpheme -CAr on imperative and incompletive verbs is analyzed as a
suffix and part of the stem, it is discussed along with the other perfect bound
morphemes in (10.8), which are clitics and outside the stem. Verbal noun (VN)
plural clitics =gg, =Agg attach to incompletive surface forms to nominalize the verb
(10.10). Adjectives used as verbs and suffixing verb inflectional suffixes are also
discussed (10.11).
In addition, there is evidence for a middle (MID) verb form which, in at least aVerb stem morphology175handful of verbs, is distinguished by [+ATR] vowels and tone change on the root.
However, since only a limited amount of data was collected on this form, the middle
is not presented in the verb morphology, but only in 14.5.2 on transitive verbs.
In (3), example verb forms are given with formulations with each of the five
morpheme slots. The symbol Ø indicates that the slot is not filled by any
morpheme.

morphology (clitics) is discussed in the next. The majority of verb suffixes are
inflectional morphemes, the exceptions being the antipassive and causative suffixes.
The majority of verb clitics are derivational or clausal morphemes, the exceptions
being the imperfect, and perfect clitics. Whereas some inflectional suffixes cannot
combine with other inflectional suffixes (*COMP-CONT), nearly all clitics can
combine with all inflectional suffixes.
As in nouns, a primary distinction between roots and stems in verbs is whether the
bound morpheme attaches to underlying-final segments or to surface-final segments.
Suffixes attaching to verb roots attach to underlying root-final segments, whereas
clitics attaching to verb stems attach to surface-final segments.
In (4a), the past continuous suffix -A᷄n attaches to the underlying short vowel in pā.án ‘guard.3sN-CONT.P’, whereas the third singular object clitic =E᷇ attaches to the
surface long vowel of the incompletive form (pāā.=ɛ᷇ ). In (4b-f), the object clitic
attaches to the surface vowels of the incompletive forms rather than to the
underlying plosives or approximants. However, in (b-c, e-f), the root-final segment
can optionally surface as an approximant, just as when copular and definite clitics
are attached to underlying approximant-final stems shown in (5) of 7.2.1
(káɔ̀/ká.ɔ̀=n, ká.w=àn ‘hyena=COP’; tā̪ ɛ̀/tā̪ .ɛ̀=n, tā̪ .y=àn ‘giraffe=COP’). The
verb of (g) with root-final consonant is given for comparison.","[174, 175, 176]"
"7.7Subordinate clause-final cliticIn subordinate clauses such as those beginning with the subordinate conjunction ɛ́
gārá ‘when’, the clitic =É attaches to the clause-final word. The marker =É
attaches to the subordinate clause of (47a), beginning with the conjunction ɛ́ gāráNoun word149‘when’, and to the subordinate clause ɔ̀ gàɔ̀-sā gùrūs=íí ‘and when a person gave

The subordinate clause-final clitic =É (SBO) should not be confused with the
subordinate verb-final clitics (SBO1, SBO2) of 10.7. In (47a), the clitic =i᷅ (SBO1)
attaches to the verb kə᷄s-s=i᷅ ‘struck=COMP =SBO1’ in addition to the clause-final
clitic =É (SBO) and is a different morpheme.
Subordinate clauses are further discussed in section 15.2 on conjunctions. In 15.3 it
will be shown that the subordinate clause-final clitic attaches to interrogative clauses
in which the interrogative pronoun is pre-verbal. As shown in (23) of 4.1.11,
subordinate clauses can contain relative clauses. In 14.7 the difference between
subordinate clauses and relative clauses is discussed.
The subordinate clause clitic =É attaches to singular and plural nouns with stemfinal consonants and the clitic =nÉ attaches to stem-final vowels.

nouns or verbs since they are not used in some of the syntactic constructions of
either nouns or verbs, and there are differences in the morphology from either
category. Adjectives are generally not attested (NA) in use as subjects, objects, or
objects of prepositions. As will be discussed in 8.3, there are three differences in the
stem morphology of nouns and adjectives with final consonants. In verb paradigms,
the long forms of subject pronouns precede the adjectival verb instead of short
subject pronouns as in true verbs. The plural adjective suffix -gg and copular clitic
=A attach to adjectival verbs of plural persons, whereas these bound morphemes
are not attached to any true verb forms. These and other details specifying the
difference between adjectives and nouns and verbs are found in 4.3.
Adjective types are discussed in 8.1, stem morphology of qualitative adjectives in
8.2, and word morphology of qualitative adjectives in 8.3.","[149, 150, 151, 152]"
"1.3The current researchThe current research was conducted beginning in 2003 with speakers living in
Khartoum. From April 2004-April 2008 the author continued field work in
Khartoum as a language research associate of the University of Khartoum, Institute
of African and Asian studies. The primary language resource persons for this period
were Hashim Orta Adaw Madal, Safadin Hamid Ateeb, and Annaim Karaka
Farajalla Yasin. All three are from the town of Soda, have spoken the Jog Tao
dialect from childhood, and continue to speak it whenever they are with other
speakers of the language. After April 2008, access to speakers was limited to two
three-week trips to Kurmuk in southern Blue Nile Province, near the home area.
The primary language resource person for this trip was Annaim Karaka Farajalla
Yasin.
The original data set of nouns and verbs were taken from word lists entered into
dictionary software by speakers of the language, which became the Gaahmg-English
Dictionary (Madal 2004). The singular and plural forms of nouns and subjunctive
and completive forms of verbs were written on cards and glossed in English and
Arabic. The cards were sorted numerous times to isolate segments and tone in the
same environments, and each time speakers read the words on the cards.
Texts were recorded on cassette, transcribed, and glossed by speakers of the
language, the recordings made from a variety of individuals in the home area.
Natural clauses were taken from the texts as frames for eliciting nouns and verbs
with various morphemes. The cards were again used to elicit multiple nouns, verbs,
and adjectives in the frames.
The data set on which the thesis is based contains 700 nouns, 150 verbs, 40
adjectives, and a handful of other parts of speech. There are 16 texts of about 30
interlinearized pages that have been collected. These consist of folk narratives,
historical narratives, personal narratives, persuasive texts, and poetic genres. Ten of
these texts are presented in chapter 17.",[19]

10.1 Introduction
At this point, the morphology of verb stems has been described. We now continue
with a morphological description of the verb word. Whereas verb inflectional
suffixes have been shown to attach to underlying-final segments, the verbal clitics of
this chapter attach to surface-final segments of inflectional suffixes or elide them.
When vowel-initial clitics are attached to vowel-final suffixes of stems such as
completive forms, the stem-final vowel is elided according to the rule {M1} in 3.1
When the agented passive clitic =E᷇ attaches to cɔ̄r-sɔ́ ‘help.3sN-COMP’, the suffixfinal vowel is elided (cɔ᷄r-s=ɛ᷇ ‘help.3sN-COMP=PAS.A’). In suffix-less stems, clitics
attach to surface-final segments. The verb nominalizer clitic =gg attaches to the
surface-final segments of the incompletive form bāā ‘throw’ rather than to the
underlying segments /ba/, and thus surfaces with a long vowel (bāā=gg
‘throw=PL’).
Verb word tonal morphology is similar to verb stem tonal morphology, but with
some differences. As shown in chapter 9 on stem morphology, subject person tone
is added to stem-final syllables: Mid tone on first and second person verbs, High
tone on third singular verbs, and Low tone on third plural verbs.

‘bury’In that verb stem tone assignment is the point of departure for verb word tone
assignment, subject person tone is commonly spread or delinked and reattached to
clitics with no underlying tone {M5-6}. However, when clitics with underlying tone
are added, subject person tone generally does not surface or cause alternations.
In (2), third singular =E, =E᷇ and second plural =OOggÓ, =ÓŌggÓ object clitics
are attached to first singular, third singular, and third plural subject completive
verbs. The tone of each clitic allomorph is different depending on the subject person
verb form to which it is attached. Thus, the clitic allomorphs are listed in
parentheses next to each form. The object clitics attached to first singular and third
plural verbs have no underlying tone on initial vowels. Thus, they are assigned the
subject person tone from the elided completive suffix vowel. The initial vowels of
the clitics are assigned first singular Mid tone in (a), and are assigned third plural
Low tone in (c). However, the clitics in (b) with underlying initial High tone are not
assigned subject person tone.","[211, 212, 213, 214]"
"10.4.1 Object pronoun segmental morphology
In (34), the third singular unmarked object clitic =E᷇ and marked clitic =ì are
attached to incompletive verbs with various root-final segments. The clitics attach
to the surface-final segments of the incompletive form rather than to the underlying
segments.

cɔ̄r-s=ɛ᷇ ‘help.3sN-COMP=3sA’. When a singular person object clitic vowel is the

pronouns follow third singular completive forms with various root vowels. The
segments in parentheses are optionally added to distinguish the object pronoun from
the completive suffix alone.

Underlying tone for object pronouns is shown in table 48. For several object
pronouns, there are different tonal allomorphs when attached to different subject
forms. Third singular =E,᷇ first plural áāggá and second plural =ÓŌggÓ objects
have underlying initial HM tone when attached to third singular verbs, but otherwise
have no tone on the first syllable. Third plural =ÉÈggÀ objects have underlying
initial HL tone when attached to third singular and third plural verbs, but otherwise
have no tone on the first syllable. First a and second =O singular objects have no
underlying tone regardless of the subject form to which they are attached. Third
marked objects have underlying initial Low tone =ì, =ììggə̀ when attached to third
singular verbs, and have underlying initial HL tone =íìggì, =íìggə̀ when attached to
third plural verbs, but otherwise have no tone on the first syllable.

Noun word = [Noun stem] + ({COP, DEF, LCM, DAT, ACM, SBO, RDM})Noun stem morphology (suffixes) is discussed in this chapter and noun word
morphology (clitics) is discussed in the next. All noun suffixes are inflectional
number markers that have referential meaning, whereas the noun clitics indicate the
role of the noun phrase within the syntactic context. Whereas inflectional suffixes
cannot combine with each other (*SG-PL), all noun clitics can combine with the
inflectional suffixes.
A primary distinction between suffixes and clitics is whether the element attaches to
underlying-final segments or to surface-final segments. Stem suffixes attaching to
noun roots attach to underlying-final segments, whereas word clitics attaching to
noun stems attach to surface-final segments. Vowel length of root-final vowels is
the primary indicator of whether the form is an underlying or surface representation.
In (2), the plural suffix -gg attaches to the underlying short vowel in t ̪ɔ́-gg ‘cow-PL’,
whereas the accompaniment clitic attaches to the surface long vowel of the singular
form (t ̪ɔ́ɔ=
́ nɛ̄).

However, the starting point for noun stem tone assignment is the root tone, whereas
the starting point of noun word tone assignment is the stem tone.
As discussed in 2.4.3, two-tone melodies on trisyllabic noun roots are assigned rightto-left. Thus, in the monomorphemic root mɔ́ggɔ́lɛ̀ɛ ̀ ‘maize’ of (3a), the Low tone
of the HL melody surfaces on the final syllable, and the High tone of the melody
surfaces on the first two syllables. Tone assignment for noun stems such as ɟílə̀bbə̀gg ‘water.spring-PL’ in (b) begins with the tone assigned to the root in the singular96A grammar of Gaahmgform ɟílə̀bb and spreads to the plural suffix -Agg having no underlying tone. If the
root tone were not the starting point, right-to-left tone assignment would render the
surface tone as *ɟílə́bb-ə̀gg instead of ɟílə̀bb-ə̀gg.

begins with the tone assigned to the stem in the plural form íl-ə̀əg̀ g and continues by
attaching the copular suffix =À with Low tone. The noun stem tone assignment ílə̀əg̀ g has the root tone îl as its point of departure where the second tone of the HL
root melody is delinked and reassigned to the tone-less suffix -AAgg {M2}. If the
stem tone were not the starting point, the word tone would be different. For
instance, if the root tone îl were the starting point, right-to-left tone assignment
would render the surface tone as *îl-ə̀əg̀ g=ə̀ instead of íl-ə̀əg̀ g=ə̀. Or, if the HL
underlying tones of the copular word form were assigned right-to-left, the surface
tone would be *íl-ə́əǵ g=ə̀ instead of íl-ə̀əg̀ g=ə̀.
In summary, we can say there are four criteria for determining which noun bound
morphemes are suffixes and thus a part of the stem, and which noun bound
morphemes are clitics and thus outside of the stem, but a part of the word. In
chapter 4, each of the morphemes listed in (4) below is shown to attach to more than
one word category. As will be shown in the respective sections of chapter 7, all
noun clitics attach to the inflectional suffixes. Also shown in the respective sections,
the clitics attach to the surface-final segments. Finally, the stem tone assignment is
the point of departure in tone assignment for the clitics. These criteria are not valid
for the inflectional number suffixes. Thus, the clitics are analyzed as being a
different kind of morpheme than the suffixes.

Stem tone assignment is the point of departureInflectional number marking with the suffix –gg occurs on both nouns and
adjectives and is one possible exception of a suffix attaching to more than one word
category, as do clitics. However, there are many other plural suffixes attaching toNoun stem97nouns which do not attach to adjectives. In contrast, all allophonic clitics (with
different forms and the same function) attach to each word category.
First, the segmental suffixes in plural formation are discussed in 6.2. Then the tonal
allomorphs of various suffixes and tone assignment are discussed in 6.3. Body
parts, a class of nouns which take special plural formation, are discussed in 6.4.
Finally, the genitive case, which only involves a tonal change, will be presented in

3pNThe adjectival verb kāyáār of (35) has subject tone inflection (final Mid for second
person, final High for third singular, and final Low for third plural) and [+ATR]
second person forms, as do true verbs. However, in some adjectives used as verbs,
person inflection is not as regular as the adjectival verb paradigm in (35). Second
plural forms of some adjectival verbs have Low final tone instead of Mid (kɔ́ɔf́ àr,
kúúfə̀r-g=ə̀ ‘thin.INCP-2pN=COP’) and second person forms of some adjectival
verbs have [-ATR] quality instead of [+ATR] (bánd̪āl, bánd̪āl-g=ā ‘weak.INCP2pN=COP’). These features mark adjectives as being different than true verbs.
Since adjectives have some differences in syntax and morphology compared to both
nouns and verbs, they are analyzed as a separate category. Adjective clitic
morphology similar to that of noun morphology is presented in 8.3, whereas76A grammar of Gaahmgadjective morphology similar to verb morphology is presented in 10.11.
In the following chapters, word categories are discussed one-by-one. For each, we
first discuss the function followed by the forms of morphemes attached to roots or
stems. Because possessive pronouns are important for the discussion on nouns and
verbs, pronouns in general are discussed first, followed by nouns, adjectives, verbs,
prepositions, locatives, and adverbs. Each of these is a lexical category, as are
conjunctions discussed in 15.2.","[75, 76, 77]"
"Introduction1.419Overview and notationsGaahmg is rich in morphology, particularly in nouns, adjectives, and verbs. To
correctly analyze the morphemes and their alternations, we also discuss their
phonological foundation and describe their syntactic environments.
The phonological description of chapter 2 includes distribution and contrasts of
phonemes, phonological rules, syllable structure, and a tonal description of roots.
Consonant weakening is common word-finally and intervocalically in roots and
across morpheme boundaries. A significant number of lexical distinctions as well as
distinctions in grammatical function are made exclusively by [ATR] harmony and
tone. Thus, the phonological analysis of these aspects is indispensable for the
morphological analysis.
Segmental and tonal morphophonological rules are presented in chapter 3. The vast
majority of the alternations when morphemes combine can be attributed to processes
described by these eleven rules. Clitics, having different alternations and functions
than suffixes, are shown in chapter 4 to attach to more than one word category. In
4.2, there are four other criteria discussed which can be used to distinguish suffixes
from clitics such as that suffixes attach to underlying forms of roots, whereas clitics
attach to surface forms of stems. In 4.3, we establish adjectives as a distinct lexical
category from nouns and verbs since they are not used in some of the syntactic
constructions of either nouns or verbs, and there are some differences in the
morphology when used as either category.
In chapters 5-13, word categories are presented. The morphology of nouns (chap. 67), adjectives (chap. 8), and verbs (chap. 9-10) are the heart of this thesis. Pronouns
(chap. 5), prepositions (chap. 11), body part locatives (chap. 12), and adverbs (chap
13) are the minor word categories described, which have little or no morphology.
In chapter 6, we see that nouns have singular and plural suffixes. Although the vast
majority of singular nouns do not have suffixes, plural marking is obligatory with
plural referents. There are several plural suffixes, each with different tonal
allomorphs, although most includes the segment gg. Most plural suffixes have no
semantic correlation with the nouns to which they attach, but the suffix attached
sometimes depends on the root-final segment.
As shown in chapter 7, noun stems may attach one or more of seven clitics: copular,
definite, locative copular, dative, accompaniment, subordinate, or relative clause
definite clitics. The clitics have different segmental or tonal allomorphs which
attach depending on the stem-final segment. In chapter 8, we show that adjectives
are similar to nouns in stem and word morphology. Most adjectives attach the plural
suffix -gg which is required on plural referents. The same seven clitics attaching to
nouns may also attach to adjectives.","[19, 20]"
"9.2InfinitiveInfinitives are the most common form used in foregrounded nuclear clauses of
narratives, i.e. sequences of events. As such, they often encode actions that can be
translated into English as past tense, such as in (11). Infinitives commonly occur
following the infinitive verb dɔ̄ɔs̀ ‘start’ as in (11a), but can follow various other
verb forms and can be the first verb of a clause or sentence.

outAs such, infinitives are used in finite sentences. As discussed in 9.3, subjunctive
verbs are commonly used in typical non-finite contexts such as ‘want to X’.
Infinitive forms differ from finite forms in that they do not change with subject
person, either in tone or [ATR] quality. Also, the subject pronouns preceding an
infinitive verb differ from those of other verb forms. Singular pronouns of such
verbs all have Mid tone and plural pronouns have Low tone. Also, second person
pronouns are not clitics prefixed to the infinitive verbs, evidenced by the fact that
they do not take the [ATR] quality of the verb. Because of these differences with
other verb forms which change according to the subject person, this form which
does not change with the subject is analyzed as the infinitive.

All root-final consonants-CInfinitive verbs generally surface the same as the root. Since plosives and
approximants are not weakened word-finally in accordance with {P1b} of 2.1.3, it is
posited that a copied final consonant is added to the underlying-final segment which
surfaces as a single segment. Roots with final n as in (13h) optionally surface
without the final consonant and then with a lengthened vowel, in accordance with
{P4} in 2.3.3. Vowel-final roots add the segment -d̪ as in (o) or do not add any
suffix as in (p). It is possible that the vowel-final verb of (o) used to have final d̪
and that the vowel-final verb of (p) used to have final n, since these segments
optionally surface in some forms of the verb as will be seen in following sections.

‘ . . (but) the goat I am giving to the old men to eat.’ (Jooj12)Regardless of what grammatical verb form the subjunctive follows, it has the same
segmental form. In (a) it follows a verb, in (b) an incompletive verb, and in (c) a
continuous form.
Subjunctive verbs add the suffix -d̪A to the root, except in first and second singular
person forms, where other suffixes can sometimes be added depending on the rootfinal segments. A subject pronoun with Mid tone introduces the subjunctive verb.
Plural pronouns before such verbs do not have the plural marker -gg, and second
person pronouns are optionally [+/- ATR] regardless of the [ATR] quality of the root
vowel. The subjunctive particle ā is an optional alternative for introducing third
person subjunctive verbs, as shown in (14b,c).

In (16), first and third singular subjunctive forms with each of the root-final

g attach the suffix -CA where C has the same features as the root-final consonant.
As in (f-g), first singular forms with root-final approximants w and y attach the
suffix -(n)(A) and the underlying approximant surfaces as a vowel, as will be
explained shortly. The suffix-initial -n is sometimes elided, and when this happens,
the approximant remains a vowel. As in (o), first singular subjunctives with rootfinal vowel add the same suffix as in third singular subjunctives -d̪(A), except that
the vowel is optional, or add the suffix -n(a) as in (p). First singular subjunctives

‘say’Third singular subjunctives have various alternations which are only attested in verb
morphology. Those of (16a-d) undergo a coronal assimilation process. The rootfinal coronal consonants d̪, s, n, ð take on all the features of the suffix-initial
coronal d̪. In 9.5, it will be seen how the same root-final segments assimilate to the
initial s of the completive suffix -sA.
The third singular subjunctive forms of (16d-f) also undergo an assimilation process.
The suffix-initial dental plosive assimilates to ð, r, and w. There are two forms for
plural subjunctives with root-final ð as in (d): the root-final consonant either
assimilates to the suffix consonant as in fɛ́d-̪ d̪ā ‘release’, or the suffix consonant
assimilates to the root-final consonant as in fɛ́ð-ðā ‘release’. In (g), the suffix-Verb stem morphology183initial plosive may also assimilate to the underlying approximant y (kɔ́y.-yá) which
weakens to the vowel ɛ after the suffix vowel a is elided (kɔ́ɛ.́ -ɛ́). This assimilation
process to the root-final ð, r, and w does not always apply for every word with every
speaker, but varies from word to word and from speaker to speaker.
Rule {P1b} in section 2.1.3 states that /b/, /ɟ/, /w/, /y/ are weakened word-finally to
vowels with the same [ATR] quality as the preceding vowel. The same weakening
process occurs syllable-finally before a consonant-initial suffix, provided that the
underlying root-final consonant is not the same as the suffix-initial consonant. In
the third singular subjunctive forms of (f-i), b becomes ɔ (àɔ̀-d̪ɔ̀ ‘sit’), ɟ becomes ɛ
(káɛ́-d̪ā ‘bring’), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ d̪ɔ ́ ‘cook’)
before the consonant-initial suffix -d̪A. The [+round] feature spread to the suffix
vowel as in ɲáɔ́-d̪ɔ ́ ‘request’ is further support of the root-final segment weakening
to a vowel. Similarly, in the first singular forms of (f-g), w becomes ɔ (ɲáɔ́-nɔ́
‘request’), and y becomes ɛ (kɔ́ɛ-́ nɔ́ ‘cook’) before the consonant-initial suffix -n(A).
However, b,ɟ do not become ɔ,ɛ in the first singular forms àb-bà ‘sit’, káɟ-ɟā ‘bring’
of (h-i), and w does not become ɔ in the third singular form ɲáw-wā ‘request’ of (f),
since the suffix-initial consonant has become the same as the underlying root-final
consonant.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

"ISBN 978-94-6093-078-2A grammar of Gaahmg,
A Nilo-Saharan Language of SudanGaahmg is morphologically rich, employing many suffixes and clitics on nouns,
adjectives, and verbs. Tone and [ATR] quality distinguish a significant number
of lexemes and grammatical functions. Several specific processes of consonant
weakening, vowel elision, [+ATR] spreading, [+round] spreading, and morphological tone rules, account for the vast majority of alternations when morphemes
are combined.",[1]

There are three differences in the stem morphology of nouns and adjectives with
final consonants. As shown in (32), singular nouns attach the copular clitic =Ā,
whereas singular adjectives do not attach any clitic. Plural nouns attach the definite
clitic =Á with High tone, whereas plural adjectives attach the definite clitic =À
with Low tone.

In addition, the definite clitic =Vn with no underlying tone attaches to
monosyllabic vowel-final nouns (máà, máá.=àn ‘house=DEF’), whereas the definite
clitic =V́n with High tone attaches to monosyllabic vowel-final adjectives (íì, íī.=ín
‘heavy=DEF’). The differences in syntactic function and the differences in
morphology, support the claim of there being both categorical nouns and adjectives.
A few adjectives may be derived from nouns with the suffix -i as seen from the data
of (33) taken from the Gaahmg-English Dictionary by Madal (2004). The
derivation from one category to the other also supports the claim of both categories.

"1.1Gaahmg languageAt the request of speakers, the name of the language is written orthographically with
the grapheme /aah/ for the long vowel [əə]. The language name is pronounced
[gə̀ə̀mg], meaning ‘people of the Gaam or Ingessana Hills’. Other names for the
language include Ingessana, Gaam, and Tabi. Ingessana is a name given by Arabs.
Gaam is the word for hill, and Tabi is a hill name in the home area (Bender 1980:4).
Gaahmg is classified as a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language. Greenberg was
the first to list Tabi (Gaahmg) as a separate branch of the Eastern Sudanic subfamily (1955:62). Bender proposed that Gaam belongs to an Eastern Jebel Family
including the languages Aka, Molo, Kelo, and Ben Sheko which all have a first
singular pronoun with the segment n and other similarities. He added that the total
number of speakers of Eastern Jebel languages other than Gaam speakers probably
does not exceed 2,000 (Bender 1998:39).
The Ethnologue states there are 67,200 Gaahmg speakers, who mainly live in the
Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province (Gordon 2005), bordering Ethiopia to the
east. There are four dialects: Jog Tao (Soda area), Buwag (southeast area), Kulag
(Bao area), and Jog Goor (northwest area). The first two are more closely related to
each other, and the last two to each other. Although the dialects are distinct enough
phonetically and lexically to identify a person as from the dialect area, they are
easily understood from one to another (Jedrej 1995: 32). The teachers, politicians
and other educated people mostly come from the Jog Tao dialect, which is analyzed
in this thesis.
There are three published linguistic works on the language that predate the research
of this author: Ethnographical Observations in Dar Fung by E. E. Evans-Pritchard
(1932), The Phonological Features of the Ingessana Language by W. J. Crewe
(1975), and Preliminary Gaam-English-Gaam Dictionary by M. L. Bender & Malik
Agaar Ayre (1980).",[16]

Relative clauses are introduced with the relativizer ná/nà ‘who, which, that’ which
agrees in number with the head noun it follows. Relative clauses have been attested
to modify noun subjects as in (48), objects as in (49), and copular complements as in
(50).

‘Those which we left behind . . ’ (Thng7)REL.PLRelative clauses differ from subordinate clauses in the conjunctions introducing the
clause, in the clause-final clitics, and in marking for definiteness. As will be
discussed in 15.2, the subordinate conjunctions ɛ́ gārá ‘when, while’, ɛ́ kɔ̄rá
‘because’, (ār) ‘if’, wàr ‘but’ introduce subordinate clauses instead of the relativizer
ná/nà. As shown in 7.7 and 8.3.8, the clause-final subordinate clitic is always =É
with High tone, whereas the relative clause clitic agrees in number with the head
noun =É/=È. Finally, subordinate clauses are not distinguished for definiteness,
but many relative clauses are.
Relative clauses can take the place of noun modifiers which are either marked or
unmarked for definiteness. Thus, relative clauses are also marked or unmarked for
definiteness. In (48-50), the relative clauses are definite, whereas in (51) the relative
clause is unmarked for definiteness. Most commonly the head noun is unmarked for
definiteness if the relative clause has a definite clitic. Singular definite clitics on
relative clauses have High tone and plural definite clitics have Low tone.
Table 59: Definite relative clause clitics
ShortSGPL=É=ÈIn noun phrases with dative, accompaniment, and subordinate clitics, there is no
marking for definiteness and the noun phrases are ambiguous for definiteness.
However, in relative clauses with such nouns, there is a definiteness distinction,
except with dative relative clauses which cannot attach a dative clitic to semantically
indefinite relative clauses. Some clitics such as the dative merge with the definite
relative clause clitic (=É=A᷇n becomes =ÉĒn), but other clitics such as the
accompaniment and subordinate follow the definite relative clause clitic (=É=nĒ
becomes =ÉÉ=nĒ, where =nĒ is the accompaniment clitic attaching to vowelfinal stems). This definite marking is shown in (52) where the same definite relative
clause clitics attach to clause-final nouns, adjectives and verbs—all consonant-final.
Dashes indicate there are no clitics on the clause-final word, whereas an x indicates
the word category cannot occur as definite.","[297, 298]"
"Verb word morphology239Second person forms are always [+ATR], as well as the clitics for most other person
forms of incompletive imperfect verbs, but clitics of first and third person forms in
completive, subjunctive, and continuous past verbs are [-ATR]. Singular person
clitics have short vowels and plural person clitics have long vowels.

In 4.1.10, 7.7, and 8.3.8, clause-final subordinate clitics were discussed. In this
section, verb-final subordinate clitics are discussed, which differ in form and
function from clause-final subordinate clitics. Whereas clause-final subordinate
clitics mark the end of subordinate clauses, verb-final subordinate clitics mark verbs
as being in a subordinate clause and in which type of subordinate clause. There are
three verb-final subordinate clitics which appear with different subordinating
conjunctions introducing the clause. Third person subordinate clitics are listed in
table 50 and are shown in example clauses which follow. The first verb-final
subordinate clitic listed is introduced by either the conjunctions ‘when’ or ‘because’.

verb-final subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) attaches in clauses introduced with the
conjunctions ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ or ɛ́ kɔ̄rá ‘because’. In (c), the verb-final subordinate
clitic =E᷇ (SBO2) attaches in the conditional ‘if’ clause, not introduced by any242A grammar of Gaahmgconjunction. In conditional ‘if’ clauses, the subject pronoun ɛ̄ ‘he’ is required
between the noun subject and verb. The verb wə́r=ì ‘take=3sAM’ in the result
clauses of (a-b) has incompletive aspect and the verb wár-s=ɛ̀ɛ̀ ‘take-COMP=3sA’ in
the result clause of (c) has completive aspect. In addition, the object pronoun
attached to the verbs in the result clause of (a-b) is the marked [+ATR] object clitic
=ì, whereas in (c) is the unmarked [-ATR] object clitic =È.

and clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) can both be attached to verbs when
clause-final in definite relative clauses. In 15.3, it will be shown that the clause-final
subordinate clitic =É (SBO) attaches in interrogative clauses when interrogative
pronouns are pre-verbal. In 15.3, it will also be shown that when an interrogativeVerb word morphology243pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1)
is attached to the verb.
The same distinctions are made by verb-final clitics when the subordinate clause is
sentence-final as when the subordinate clause is sentence-initial.

In antipassive clauses, the speaker indicates an implied, unknown object (patient,
theme, or experiencer). Such verb forms are marked by the antipassive suffix -An
which attaches to the verb root before inflectional suffixes are added. As in active
clauses, agents can also be post-verbal in antipassive clauses. In such clauses, verbs
are marked with the agented passive clitic =E᷇ /=ÉĒ as shown in (17).

Causative clauses are used to indicate the reason or initiative of the action being a
different argument than that which does the action. Causative verbs then add a
second argument to intransitive clauses and a third argument to transitive clauses.
They are marked by the vowel specified as [+ATR] and by the causative suffixesClause-level syntax287-s+A, -d̪+A.
In (19), the reason or initiative for breaking is from àggáár ‘hunter’, but the actual
breaking is done by ɟɛ̄n ‘person’. As shown in (20), causative clauses can also have
post-verbal agents, being marked by the agented passive clitic =E᷇.

Antipassive causative clauses indicate that one or more of the non-agent arguments
are unknown. The same verb form is used regardless of which of the non-agent
arguments or how many of them are unknown. Antipassive causative clauses with
post-verbal agents also have the same form regardless of which non-agent argument
or how many are unknown. In (22-23) the patient is unknown, in (24-25) the
experiencer is unknown, and in (26-27) the patient and experiencer are unknown.

"The syntax is equally interesting. Agentive passive, agentless passive, antipassive, and causative verb forms are syntactically and morphologically distinct
and combine in nearly all possible ways. All pronouns use vowel features to
represent the person referred to, the three persons coinciding with the language’s
three vowel harmony pairs. Body part locatives are similar in form and meaning to inherently possessed body part nouns, but are a distinct lexical category
in form and function.
These and other features make the description a valuable resource for NiloSaharan linguists as well as those interested in the typology of African languages.",[1]
