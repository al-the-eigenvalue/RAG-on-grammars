Although it is an incredibly rare case in practice – I have certainly never naturally
attested anything like this – one might conceivably encounter a case in which two
individuated but unidentifiable (and therefore, not case-marked) referents occur in the
same transitive clause, in conditions where it would be pragmatically unknowable which
was more likely to be understood as the relatively more active/agentive. 266 In such a case,
265Falthough any constituent order is possible, the initial noun phrase is almost always
understood by my consultants as more likely to register as agentive (864). This could
423Hconceivably be taken as weak evidence for a preferred Subject-Object-Verb order;
however, it would be difficult to clearly establish that the interpretation would not in fact
be due to some inferred pragmatic relations – i.e., that the initial noun phrase is more
topical – together with an inferred likelihood that the more topical participant would tend
to be more agentive.

Similarly, most types of hortatives and imperatives are sensitive to subject person;
for example, non-inclusive (unmarked) imperatives require a second person subject while
inclusive hortatives require a first person dual or plural subject (independent of object
type). For discussion and examples, see §9.5.2.
421H14.1.3.5. Evidence from pivots (cross-clause coreferentiality)
Although Galo does not robustly exhibit the strongly subject-oriented pivots and
switch-reference functions in its clause chains which are found in many other clause
chaining languages (§16.4.2.2.3), the sets of restrictions and possibilities which do exist
42Happear to always make reference either to S/A or to a syntactic non-subject.
For example, in an embedded temporal subordination (§16.4.3.2), an ellipsed
423Hsubject is obligatorily coreferential with the main clause subject (859).

Similarly, a clausal adverbial subordination in Stative imperfective aspect exhibitsa “disjunct” constraint against cross-clause subject coreference (§12.5.2.3, §16.5.4.3). In
425H426H(860), the ellipsed subordinated clause subject must be in a different person from the

(TR, FS 008)14.1.3.6. Evidence from constituent order
Unlike in some languages (such as English), constituent order is at best a weak
correlate of grammatical relations in Galo. Although the statistically most frequent Galo
constituent order is without question A O V, when the O argument is definite and
referential – meaning that it is obligatorily marked in the accusative – constituents may be
arranged in the most pragmatically useful order. Thus, there is a pragmatic difference
between (862)-(863) (in (863), O sounds more focal/contrastive), but there is no
4231H423H423Hgrammatical/semantic difference, nor any hint of potential confusion.

‘The male slave I gave (to someone)’ but not *‘The male slave to whom I gave

be underlyingly subcategorized for E arguments. For example, Goal arguments of motion

arguments of motion verbs are usually either unmarked for case, or are marked in the
locative (although accusative marking is possible in a limited, “experiential” sense; see
§14.3.2.3), while Theme arguments of transfer verbs are generally marked as topical
420Hinstruments (§14.2.2.1.2.1).
421HIn sum, E arguments align with O arguments in some respects (accessibility to
Accusative case-marking and Non-subject nominalization) but not in others (consistent
Accusative case-marking and accessibility to internally-headed relativization).
At the same time, E arguments are distinct from obliques, despite that their
syntactic marking may sometimes overlap. Consider the oblique temporal and mediative
noun phrases, which initiate and terminate the sentence in (869).

In (869), neither the temporal nor the instrumental noun phrase is required in order

Although not a strict syntactic requirement, they occur on the periphery of the clause
syntax, rather than within the clause syntactic core as E arguments tend to (see for694example (866)). Also, neither the temporal nor the viative noun phrase may be
42Hcoreferential with a non-subject nominalization in -nam.
Thus, the picture that emerges is one in which O and E arguments are consistently
opposed both to subject functions (S and A) and to oblique functions, but are neither
consistent in their alignment nor in their opposition to one another. This scenario is
schematized in Figure 14.3.

(but that this difference is sometimes elided, as in nominalization/relativisation). I leave
this question open for future research. 271
270F14.1.3.9. Additional lexical-semantic and syntactic properties of E arguments
In addition to the verb and clause types discussed in §14.1.3.8, certain types of
426Hcomplement clause might be analysed as an E argument. For example, the speech
reporting verb ә́m- ‘say (that)’ obligatorily subcategorizes for a direct speech report in271The “usual suspect” approaches would be to treat the O relation as “direct object” and the E relation as
“indirect object”, or else as “primary” and “secondary” objects respectively. I do not see how either
approach would be appropriate here. First, “primary” and “secondary” object as defined by Dryer (1986)
refers to the grammatical alignment of extended transitive Recipient and transitive Patient in opposition to
extended transitive Theme – that is clearly not in evidence here. Regarding “direct” and “indirect” objects –
which refers to the consistently different grammatical treatments of O and E, O standing as “direct” object
and E as “indirect” object (and in which E may be “promoted” in some constructions to the “direct” object
relation) – I hope I have shown that this too is not obviously in evidence (although I do not doubt that a
good case in favour of this analysis could be made).","[693, 694, 695]"
"Grammatical functions and grammatical relations
“Grammatical functions” may be understood quite generally to indicate thegrammatical role played by a particular noun phrase with respect to the argument
structure of the clause in which it occurs: namely, whether the noun phrase stands as a
core argument of that clause, or not, and if so, as what sort, etc. By contrast, the term
“grammatical relations” has come to be understood as referring to the grammaticalization
of particular “macro-alignments” of grammatical functions, as they are reflected in and/or
made use of in various and potentially quite diverse areas of the grammar (Andrews
1985). While there is nothing approaching widespread agreement concerning the
applicability of both concepts (in the same way or at all) to all languages, it seems to me
that their application in this way leads to a reasonable description of the grammar of Galo.
The following three subsections will present an overview.
14.1.1. Transitivity, argument structure and “macro-roles”
I take the terms transitivity and argument structure to indicate two semi-distinct
viewpoints on the same overall linguistic property, which is the number and status of
noun phrases which are required to be present in a clause if a particular sense of the
predicate is to properly obtain; “transitivity” seems to imply a more predicate-oriented
stance (i.e., one speaks of the “transitivity” of verbs), while “argument structure” seems to
imply a more noun phrase-oriented stance (i.e., we speak of the “number and status of
(noun phrase) arguments”), and that is all.
By macro-roles I intend the conventional assignment in Basic Linguistic Theory
(beginning with Dixon (1979)) of “syntactico-semantic” labels S, A, O and E to the
following argument types, according to the transitivity of the clauses in which they occur:682S
A
O
ESingle argument of an intransitive clause
More controlling/actor-like argument of a transitive clause
Less controlling/acted-on argument of a transitive clause
Extension to the core of an atransitive, intransitive or transitive clauseThese labels are first used in a lexical-semantic sense, to refer to the set of “core
arguments” for which a particular predicate word is specified (§5.2.4); so, for example, a
419Htransitive sense of də́m- ‘hit’ has two core arguments A and O as part of its lexical
specification, and this lexically-specified argument structure may or may not undergo a
subsequent set of restructuring derivations (i.e., “valence-changing” derivations; cf.
§11.2.5) prior to reaching the final projection of a predicate word when it is uttered in a
4192Hclause.
The labels are also employed with a clause-level, syntactic sense, to refer to the
realization of a predicate’s arguments by particular noun phrases in a clause (§9.2); so, for
4193Hexample, two noun phrases, each with a set of independently definable properties, occur
in any clause headed by transitive verb root də́m- ‘hit’.
Accordingly, the following set of core argument structures are established, in
which S, A, O and E refer both to the set of core arguments assigned to a predicate and to
their syntactic realization in a particular clause headed by that predicate, and (OBL) refers
to any number of oblique (a.k.a. “adjunct”, “peripheral” or “non-core” noun phrases).
Oblique noun phrases may provide some additional information regarding, but do not
directly support, the core sense of the predicate (Figure 14.1).

ordering here is arbitrary, and is not intended to reflect actual constituent order in Galo14.1.2. Relationship between semantic roles, argument types and syntactic
realizations
The literature abounds with proposals as to how the relationship between semantic
roles, argument types and syntactic realizations should be construed, both in universalgrammatical (or universal-cognitive) senses and in senses developed with respect to
683particular languages or types of languages, and assessment of even a small portion of
these proposals nowadays must lie well beyond the scope of a descriptive grammar. I
simply outline here the approach which I have found useful in the analysis of Galo
grammar, and readily concede that any number of more efficient or insightful proposals
may be adduced, either with respect to human language overall or with respect to Galo in
particular. 263
26FFirst, in some “underlying” sense, we can understand a verb to be
“subcategorized” for a set of zero or more arguments, as outlined in Figure 14.1. Next (in
4195Han analytical rather than procedural sense of “next”), we can understand these core
arguments to be underlyingly associated with a set of semantic types, in the sense of a
lexicon-internal “construction”. Potentially, a large set of verbs may assign a similar or
identical set of semantic types to the same basic set of arguments (for example, a large set
of “state change” verbs may assign Agent and Theme roles to A and O arguments
respectively); or, there may be a more detailed semantic specification of the type of
nominal which can stand in a particular argument position (for example, one existential
verb may subcategorize for an animate S while another may subcategorize for an
inanimate S). In principle, this assignment could be viewed as arbitrary, however in
practice, of course, more agentive semantic roles are generally assigned to the A
argument position and less agentive roles to the O argument position.
Then, we come to the syntactic realization of the arguments in a particular clause,
as they are “projected” by the predicate as a function of its head (usually, a verb, but
possibly also an adjective); at this point only, it becomes possible to talk of “grammatical
relations”, or higher-order alignments of certain argument types in opposition to others. In
Galo, we find good evidence for the grammaticalization of S/A alignment in opposition to
the “core remainder” O and/or E , and may therefore begin to speak of, for example, the
“subject” of a particular clause, as it may be identified in terms of a set of criteria to be
outlined in §14.1.3. The projected instantiations of underlying, verb-subcategorized A, O
4196Hand so on are thus recognized in terms of these identified mapping relations (A onto
“subject”, etc.).
Figure 14.2 roughly schematizes this conception:
4197H263My principle informing influences have been the construction-based grammar of Croft (2001), and the
inductive, typologically-oriented proposals of Basic Linguistic Theory, particularly as developed by Dixon
and colleagues (Dixon 1979; Dixon 1994; Dixon and Aikhenvald 2000).","[682, 683, 684]"

talk-APPL:MEET-REFL-IPFV
‘talking to one another’
In (17), Imperfective -dùu is suffixed to a bound verb root záp- ‘talk’. Neither zápnor -dùu can stand independently, nor can they stand in any other relative order. A single,
uninterruptible prosodic contour occurs over zabdù, with potential pauses at either edge,
with a single tone contour and constituting a single metrical foot. On the segmental level,
internal sandhi and boundary phenomena are observed (i.e. Regressive voicing
assimilation (§4.1.3.7) occurs at the word-internal syllable boundary and Final length
neutralization (§4.1.4.4) occurs at the right-edge word boundary). Native speakers readily
152attribute meaning to zabdù but are unable to easily describe the meaning or function of
either of its parts. In short, a diverse set of criteria converge to support the notion thatzabdù is a “word”.
Now, however, consider (18). Here again, grammatical criteria identify a single
word. No subset of the string can occur independently or in any other order, and although
native speakers can attribute meaning to the whole, they cannot easily assign meaning to
its parts. However, two distinct prosodic units can now be identified, in which two
primary stress slots are found. Assimilation sandhi occur at the border of záp- and -rɨ ́k but
not at the border of -rɨ ́k and -hí (word-internally, h surfaces [s] post-consonantally; cf.
§3.2.4). In short, phonological criteria suggest that this is not one but rather two words.
Following the generally-accepted framework summarized in Dixon and
Aikhenvald (2002), as set forth in numerous previous works by them and other scholars,
this disconnect will be described here in terms of a difference between two types of unit:
“grammatical word” and “phonological word”. 71 The following subsections review
criteria by which these units may be identified. Some of these criteria involve
exceptionless (or rarely violable) rules, while others consist of more probabilistic
tendencies. In some cases, the convergence among or contrast between grammatical and
phonological words is robust, as in (17)-(18) above. In other cases, the analysis hinges on
thin and contextually variable criteria. The resulting picture is complex, perhaps in some
ways unsatisfyingly so. However, it must be recalled that Galo has heretofore been an
instrument for oral, face-to-face communication, and has not been significantly shaped by
conventionalization for writing purposes. Many of the difficulties found (by linguists and
native speakers alike) in consistently segmenting utterances into “words” for the purpose
of writing the language (as we are doing here) are, when speaking, simply a non-issue. 72
71This sense of “grammatical word” is not to be confused with another, unrelated sense in which
“grammatical word” denotes words which have as their value a grammatical function as opposed to a
lexical meaning, i.e. (in English) words like “the”, “to”, and “and” as opposed to “boat” and “tree”. To
avoid confusion, in the present work we use the term “grammatical word” in the Dixon-Aikhenvald sense of
opposition to “phonological word” and the term “function word” to refer to words with grammaticalfunctional as opposed to lexical status.
72
It is also instructive to consider that the word for ‘word’ in Galo agóm (< PTs *gom ‘speech; voice’) also
has the related senses ‘speech’, ‘language’, ‘utterance’, and ‘matter/point’. Thus, it might be more accurate
to gloss agóm as something like ‘communicum’ in the sense of ‘unit and/or medium of communication’,
without regard to segmentation or length. According to this definition (and according to Galo speakers’
usual judgments), both phonological and grammatical words may qualify as agóm (even when these do not
coincide), but neither roots nor affixes do. One might note here a potential similarity with Tibetan (among
other languages), in which multiword utterances, rather than words per se, are separated by spaces when
writing (Sprigg 1955). Importantly, such types contrast with the traditional Chinese concept of the basic
unit of language, the zǐ, which has a lower-level denotation including roots and morphemes, but no unit1534.1.1. Grammatical word
As defined by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:§7), a grammatical word is
identifiable as a grammatical unit between morpheme and syntactic phrase, whose
constitutents are a head plus immediate (local) dependents, in a fixed, continuous order in
terms of a given semantic value. These identification criteria are probably universal, and
are expanded on only briefly here with reference to examples (17) and (18) above.
a) indivisibility. Independent words cannot generally interrupt the strings of
morphemes expressed in (17) and (18). 73
b) patterning as a unit. The strings in (17) and (18) can be moved and modified
within the syntax as wholes, but no subset can.
c) fixed order. The orders of elements in (17) and (18) are fixed. While certain
sequences of grammatically bound forms (for example, predicate derivations (§11)) are to
an extent variably-ordered in Galo, variation always results in a different meaning; i.e., a
different grammatical word.
d) status as a syntactic unit. The strings in (17) and (18), taken as wholes, each
realize a predicate (a unit referred to by various syntactic rules, which is a constituent of
various phrase types, etc). No subset of either string in (17) and (18) can qualify as such a
syntactic unit.
e) grammatical part-whole composition. The functional and structural descriptions
of the parts in (17) and (18) refer to the whole, and the functional and structural
description of the whole makes reference to the parts. No elemental subset of (17) or (18)
relates to another constituent at the same or a higher level.
f) native speaker awareness of meaning and independent status. Speaking very
generally, a speaker is more likely to feel comfortable uttering and assigning meaning to a
grammatical word in isolation than to one of its subparts. For example, most speakers
sense no difficulty in uttering and assigning meaning to zabdù in (17) out-of-context,
although the same cannot be said of hidù in (18). There are difficulties in applying this
criterion, since native speakers typically experience greater difficulties in assigning
meaning to function words than to lexemes (i.e., go in would go is more easily defined or
larger than a word (Chao 1968). Some modern, linguistically-inclined Galo have coined the term gomcɨ ̀r
(lit., ‘speech pellet’) to denote sub-lexical roots and morphemes; it remains to be seen whether this usage
will become widely-accepted or not.

It might be wondered whether the Generic-Specific patterning exemplified here
and below might not be more straightforwardly described in terms of “ModifierModified”, “Head-Modifier”, or “Head-Dependent” relations, concepts which are perhaps
more commonly employed in the analysis of linear ordering relations in language.
However, it would appear that the prefixes in (87)-(88) “modify” or “depend” on the
243H24Hfollowing root at the same time as the second, more adjectival or descriptive formatives in
(89)-(90) “modify” or “depend” on the first. Thus, the “order of modification” in Galo
245H246Hword-internal structure, to the extent that it exists, would appear mixed: there are both HMOD and MOD-H types.
An alternative view, and the view taken in this work, is that a general concept of
“modification” is basically inapplicable to Galo word-formation, and that the relevant
concept is in fact “classification” (in the sense of a Type-Exemplar/Quality or, as it has
been described here, a Generic-Specific type of patterning). A more complete discussion
of this phenomenon in the Tani languages will be found in (Post in preparation-a).
Symmetrical ordering is primarily found among two-term compounds such as in
(91)-(92). These are discussed in more detail below (§5.3.1.4.1).

A large number of basic nouns and adjectives in Galo have the internal structure
[PFX-ROOT]. Although such patterns are largely unproductive in modern Galo, due to a
probable earlier high productivity there are large numbers of exemplars in the lexicon, as
well as some vestiges of productivity in certain semantic domains. Prefixes have no status
as underlying TBUs in Galo, meaning that the surface tone of a noun or adjective
composed of a prefixed root will always be a direct reflex of the underlying tone of that
root (§4.1.4.2).
250H5.3.1.1.1. a- prefix
A very large percentage of basic nouns and adjectives have initial a- or a short
vowel of another quality Vα-, both of which may be traced to an earlier prefix PTs *a(ultimately probably < PTB non-pronominal *a- (Lehman 1975)). Vα- reflexes of *areflect harmonization with a root-nuclear vowel -Vα-, a sporadic and seemingly
unpredictable process which has had different outcomes among different Tani languages
(as in Galo ə-mə̀ and Milang a-mi (Tayeng 1976:36), both < PTs *a-mɨ ‘fire’; cf.
§2.4.3.1). Often, lexicalization of prefixal vowel harmony introduced a segmental contrast
251Hat the word level at the same time that root-internal sound changes had rendered two
terms otherwise segmentally homophonous, e.g. akíi ‘guts’ (< PTs *a- + *krí ‘guts’) andikìi ‘dog’ (< PTs *a- + *kwìi ‘dog’). 112
1FNot every word-initial a- or Vα- is a true reflex of *a-. For example, although ənə̀
‘(cattle) cow’ looks similar in form to əmə̀ ‘fire’, the second reflects a genuine earlier *aprefixation in PTs *a- + *mɨ ‘fire’ (again, cf. Milang ami) while the first is a compound of
the form ə́- ‘cattle’ + nə̀- ‘female’ (cf. əbó ‘(cattle) bull’ and hoə́ ‘cattle’).
Due to historical harmonization processes, it is sometimes extremely difficult to
discern the correct etymology. For example, does okò ‘broadleafed nonwoody shrub’112It may be that lexicalization of vowel harmony in some words but not others was in part motivated by
the need to preserve lexical contrasts in the face of ongoing syllable erosion, although this is difficult to
prove. No perfect predictor of the lexicalization of vowel harmony has yet been discovered, however it is
somewhat more frequently attested among terms denoting cultural artifacts and objects of the natural world,
in that order. Very little can be said beyond this for the present.","[260, 261, 262]"

Most types of nominal modifiers of a noun phrase head are directly pre-posed to it,
with no overt marker of dependency. As such, most modifying nominals are structurally
identical to compound elements, and may be analysed in the same context. For example, a
collocation such as amée-taalíi ‘brass.bridal.platter-plate(<Ind)’ ‘brass bridal platter’
could be viewed either as a syntactic MOD-H construction, or as a productively-formed
lexical compound. Such “two-term” N-N compounds are discussed in §5.3.1.4. Although
2374Hthere seems in principle to be no lexical restrictions on the types of nominal which can
stand in the modifying nominal position, in practice, deverbal participant nominalizations
are interpreted not as modifying nominals per se, but rather as relative clauses (§15.3.1.3).
2375HFurthermore, it is more likely that semantically more descriptive nouns occur in the
modifying nominal position, although this seems to be a matter of construal; for example,ɨlɨ ̀ɨ-aapùk ‘stone-heart’ ‘stubborn temperament’ (also zero-derived for use as an adjective
292‘obdurate’) represents a metaphorical construal of a decidedly concrete, in principle nondescriptive type of noun ‘stone’ in modifying nominal position.","[290, 291, 292, 293]"

Figure 9.2 – Elements of a predicative clauseIn practice, inasmuch as ordering preferences do exist, they would seem to
correspond to specific construction types and/or sets of specifiable pragmatic conditions;
for example, more topical and/or animate referents tend to occur early in the clause, a fact
which often determines the relative order of O and E in particular (in an extended
transitive clause). In addition, potential interactions of clause constituents can influence
ordering; for example, since adverbials may be recursively embedded, a clause containing
two predicate-modifying adverbials must be structured to ensure that they are nonadjacent (see §16.5). Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a full inventory of
291Hconstruction-specific ordering preferences and principles for variation as of this writing;
this problem will be addressed more comprehensively in future research.
9.2.1.1. Arguments
Argument NPs are projected by the transitivity specification (= caseframe,
subcategorization frame) of the predicate; this process is discussed in detail in §14.1.1 (cf.
29Halso §10.4).
293HArgument NPs are obligatory features of a Galo clause, and are represented
“underlyingly” whether or not they have overt syntactic realization. In (312), two
294Htransitive clauses occur in sequence. In the first clause, the O argument ŋoí ‘fish’ has been
discussed in previous clauses, and is ellipsed due to contextual predictability. In the
410second clause, the A argument ŋunù ‘1.PL’ is coreferential with the preceding clause A;
its ellipsis serves as a partial cue to this fact. 192

Oblique NPs are not projected by the predicate, but are rather “tacked on” to the
clause as an optional adjunct. They include a variety of types and preferred positions. In
(313), both of the NPs labelled OBL may be freely inserted into any type of predicative
295Hclause, subject to semantic compatability with the predicate. 193 Unlike argument NPs,
192Foblique NPs which do not occur overtly in the clause are not usually to be viewed as
“underlyingly” present or understood from context; they are simply not there.

Temporal noun phrases and temporally-subordinated clauses are not structurallyidentical, but they overlap to a significant degree in terms of semantics, marking and
distribution. Both types strongly tend to precede the core contents of a clause, although
this is not strictly obligatory. (314) illustrates a temporally-subordinated clause,
296Hexhibiting the same marking and clausal position as the temporal noun phrase in (313).

however it has a strong statistical preference. Ellipsis almost always reflects subject continuity. For further
discussion and examples, see §16.4.2.2.3.
193
For example, an adjectival predicate would be “semantically incompatible” with the oblique noun
phrases in (313), but note that this is not of the nature of a grammatical constraint. To take an example from
English, it is perhaps nonsensical to say I’ll be tall once or twice next month, but there is nothing
grammatically “wrong” in it.","[409, 410, 411]"
"2035. Word classes and word-formation processes
This chapter discusses properties of the Galo lexicon, focusing primarily on the
major open classes noun, adjective and verb. §5.1 presents a summary overview of word
structure, semantics, distribution, and morphological marking. §5.2 discusses word class
semantics and subclassification, focusing on nouns (§5.2.2) adjectives (§5.2.3) and verbs
(§5.2.4) in order. §5.3 turns to word structure and word-formation processes, and includes
subsections on nouns and adjectives §5.3.1, verbs (§5.3.2) and adverbs (§5.3.3). §5.4 and
§5.5 give brief overviews of word class-changing derivations and reduplication
respectively, and §5.6 presents a final summary.
5.1. Overview
The basic word classes in Galo are noun, adjective, and verb. Adverbs are not
well-defined as a lexical class; most words denoting prototypical adverbial concepts (such
as predicate manner and spatio-temporal modification) are either derived from and
possibly still analyzable as nouns, or else are adjective-derived adverbials. Table 5.1
summarizes the major structural and distributional properties and subtypes of Galo words.","[203, 204]"

Table 11.4 – Selected Manner and Result predicate derivations48811.2.1.1. Result derivations and two-part stems
A number of Galo verb roots are preferentially – possibly obligatorily, at least for
some speakers – followed by a result derivation of some kind. Some well-attested
examples are kə̀r- ‘chop (something large, as a tree)’, cíK- ‘operate a door’, zɨ ́ɨ- ‘sink’,tók- ‘move down’, and kùm- ‘stack (objects with length/extent)’, although it is possible
that others exist. In most such cases, the motivation appears to be that the sense of the
verb root is viewed as incomplete in absence of some specified result. For example,
although it is perhaps possible to imagine operating a door in the abstract, in practice one
cannot operate a door without either opening or closing it; hence, (445) is straightforward,
320Hbut (446) has been rejected by my consultants (note, incidentally, that there is no basic
321HEnglish lexeme with this sense either).
(445) cittúm toké!cíK-túm-tó=kée
operate.door-CLOSED.S/O-IPTV.ODIR=HORT.POL
‘Close (the door)!’ (MN, OL17:61)(446) *ŋó ərəpə́m cikká.ŋó əráp=əəm cíK-káa
1.SG door=ACC operate.door-PF
* ‘I operated the door.’
In a similar vein, the sense of kə̀r- ‘chop (something large, such as a tree)’ isincomplete without an appropriate result derivation such as -tùu ‘IN HALF’ (compare also
English ?I’m chopping the tree, which is odd in absence of a result complement such as
down, up or into bits), and the sense of zɨ ́ɨ- ‘sink’ is incomplete without a result derivation
such as -bùk ‘INTO SUBSTANCE’ (presumably since one cannot sink without being
submerged as a result).
However, some other verb roots which require a following result derivation, such
as tók- ‘move down’ (which seems to require following result derivation -ɨ ̀ɨ ‘LOW RESULT’)
seem less easily analyzable in this way, and may simply be that they are in the process of
lexicalizing as a two-part stem. In this case, in appears that tók- ‘move down’ may once
have functioned as a general motion verb with the sense ‘descend’ (in Mising, a probably
489cognate form tok- occurs as the general ‘descend’ verb), but that this function has
obsolesced in Galo in favor of the general ‘descend’ verb ìi-. 214
213F11.2.1.2. Purpose
In a few cases, purpose senses may be inferred from Manner or Result derivations.
For example, Manner derivation -ɲòk has the basic sense ‘PLACATINGLY’, as in bə́ə-ɲòk
‘carry/hold-PLACATINGLY’ ‘hug someone placatingly’; the latter sense could as easily be
translated ‘hug someone in order to placate them’, according to the speaker’s construal.
Similarly, the Result derivation in míK-dòr-tó ‘blow-INCREASE-PFV’ ‘blew on something
(such as a fire, thus) increasing it (as its strength)’ could be as easily construed as ‘blew
on the fire in order to increase its strength’. I have not yet attested a predicate derivation
which entailed a purpose sense to the exclusion of (or in preference to) a sense of manner
or result; however, it seems likely that at least some purposive senses are preferentially
expressed by Galo speakers via the use of manner and/or result derivations.
11.2.1.3. Attainment -pàa
Attainment -pàa ‘ATTN’ is in a sense a “generic” result derivation. It has a basic
sense of attainment of the state or condition denoted by the predicate; when marking a
state or activity verb, its sense is usually that the subject referent ‘manages’ to bring about
the predicated event/state, and/or that some state resulting from the predicated event/state
is successfully or fully reached (447).

nominalization)Genitive marking of subjects in a non-subject nominalization can create potential
ambiguities which are not generally found in other nominalized clause types. This is
because the syntactic position of the genitive-marked subject of a nominalized clause –
generally, at or close to the leftward periphery of the nominalized clause – is very close to
the syntactic position of a Genitive phrase constituent of the higher noun phrase. 294 This
293Fis schematized as in Figure 15.1, and exemplified in (1018).

A similar problem attends nominalization of extended transitive clauses. Although
the unmarked order of extended transitive clauses in Galo is A E O V (§9.2.2.4), this
4568Horder cannot operate effectively inside a non-subject nominalization. This is because the294This is not a problem in the case of subject nominalizations, because the subject is either ellipsed or an
unmarked “internal” head, nor in the case of event nominalizations, seemingly because events are not as
easily construed as possessed. The ambiguity may exist in locative/oblique nominalizations, although it has
not been robustly-attested due again to the difficulty of construing many locative/oblique semantic types as
possessed. The prominence of this potential ambiguity among non-subject nominalizations can perhaps then
be explained by the ready ability for non-subject nominalizations to denote concrete, possessible entitities.","[766, 767]"

This work is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of
Galo, a Tibeto-Burman language of the Tani branch spoken in central Arunachal Pradesh
State, in the North-East Indian Himalaya. It is based on primary data obtained from
original fieldwork conducted by the author in Galo towns and villages in Arunachal
Pradesh. In addition to description of the synchronic phonology and grammar of Lare
Galo, it contains a historical overview and preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Galo
segmental phonology, in addition to a glossary of approximately 1,300 lexical roots with
4,000 lexical exemplars and three fully analyzed texts.

In this ordered change, which is shared among Lare and Pugo, but not among
most other dialects, word-final short *-a and *-ɨ vowels weaken to ə post-consonantally.
Note that this change must be ordered after Rhotic-adjacent backing (§2.4.4.4), since
Rhotic-adjacent backing innovated -ɨ rhymes in Lare which were subject to Final
weakening (e.g. ‘wind’ in Table 2.24 above). Note also the importance of “word”, rather47In northerly Tani languages, this form generally denotes ‘wool’, while in the southern languages, the
sense is ‘cotton.’115than “syllable”, in this change, in that word-initial syllables such as the ‘snake’ root bɨ- inbɨrə́m ‘python’ are unaffected (Table 2.25).
In some dialects, including the variety of Lare under description here, a possibly
associated change is *u → o, which is often then reduced to ə (and from ə, sometimes to
Ø) via a synchronically active weakening/syncope rule (cf. §4.1.4.5). It may be possible
to view the entire set of changes as part of an overall chain of word-final vowel shifts and
reductions which may be more or less active at any given point in a given dialect’s history,
as u(> o)/o/a/ɨ > ə > Ø.","[115, 116]"

Predicate derivations are followed in the predicate complex by predicateinflections. No predicate inflection may precede a predicate derivation, nor can a
predicate derivation ever follow or stand as or in place of a predicate inflection (414).

*‘We wiped out lots of wild animals.’11.1.2. Basic functions
The basic function of a Galo predicate derivation is to modify the semantic core of
a predicate, in terms of one of the following seven dimensions:
1) Manner(§11.2.1)2) Result(§11.2.1)3) Motion/Direction(§11.2.2)4) Aspect/Aktionsart(§11.2.3)5) Class Change(§11.2.4)6) Argument-determining(§11.2.5)7) Modal(§11.2.6)3186H3187H318H3189H3190H319H3192HOften, the type of modification which a particular predicate derivation imparts to a
predicate stem involves such semantic complexity that the resulting term must be
translated into English using complex, sometimes multi-clausal, syntactic constructions
(415)-(416).

“Who’s going to bob their knees up and down (while standing on) this (stick),
such that it breaks?” (NyPB, LAT 138)Despite the complexity of the semantics involved, it must be clearly understood
that the Galo expression retains the structural status of a single grammatical predicate
word, and the semantic status of a single, simple, predicate-coded event or state.
Predicate derivations are thus both structurally and semantically quite distinct from
adverbial subordinations (§16.4.2), non-final constructions (§16.5) and clausal
3195H3196Hnominalizations (§15.3), all of which have the capacity to represent complex, multi3197Hlayered event-structures and indeed multiple events.
11.1.3. Morphological complexity and syllabicity
Galo predicate derivations are either simple or complex. While simple predicate
derivations are irreducible, complex predicate derivations are most often analysable either
as historical/lexicalized or synchronic/active collocations of two simple predicate
derivations, or as a reduplication or (more often) a partial reduplication of a single simple
predicate derivation. (417) and (418) illustrate use of the simple predicate
3198H319Hderivations -kèn ‘GOOD/EASY MANNER’ and -pàa ‘ATTN’, while (419) illustrates use of the
320Hcomplex predicate derivation -kèn...-pàa ‘EASY TO DO’. The latter derives from the
discontinuous collocation of simplex -kèn and -pàa; for further discussion of complex
predicate derivations, see §11.3; for the syntactic status of the resulting Multiword
3201Hpredicate in terms of the Galo predicate complex, see §10.5.

say-EASILY.1 say-EASILY.2-NEG
‘It’s not easy to say.’ (KN, OLB2:45)The majority of simple predicate derivations are monosyllabic, as -pàa ‘ATTN’.
Although complex predicate derivations such as -kèn...-pàa ‘EASY TO DO’, being
composed of two discontinuous simple, monosyllabic, predicate derivations, are thus by
definition disyllabic when viewed as a lexical entry, since they are discontinuous in
realization they are monosyllabic in terms of the phonological words in which they are
realized. True polysyllabic predicate derivations, in the sense of a derivation realized by a
continuous sequence of more than one syllable, are extremely rare and have apparently
arisen as a result of relatively recent fusions of earlier monosyllables. Examples of this
type are found in §11.3.3.
320H11.1.4. Concatenation of multiple predicate derivations in a single predicate stem
As discussed in §11.1.1, predicate derivations may be bound directly to an
3204Hadjective (412) or verb root (413). However they may also occur on a stem which has
3205H3206Halready been expanded by another predicate derivation; (412) is such an example, in
3207Hwhich the Causative Valence-changing derivation -mó ‘CAUS’ follows the Terminative
Aspect/aktionsart derivation -róo ‘TERM’. In (420), we find an example of three predicate
3208Hderivations occurring in direct sequence in the same predicate stem.

imbibe-EXH-FIRST-CAUS-IPTV.SDIR=HORT.POL
ROOTPDER PDER PDER INFLPCL‘Let him finish drinking first, will you?’ (MN, OL23:75)
Examples like (420) are relatively rare, and may be said to represent an extreme
3209Hcase of predicate derivation “stacking”. That is to say, although I have not seen a speaker
reject a sentence as being ungrammatical on the apparent basis that its predicate contained
too many predicate derivations, due to the often quite complex and particular semantic
content of most predicate derivations, it is often all but impossible to contrive a situation464in which more than two or three might be used; three is the largest number of
concatenated derivations I have attested naturally, as in (420).
3210H11.1.5. Positional variability, derivational scope, and subclassification
Given that multiple predicate derivations may occur within a single predicate stem
(§11.1.4), it follows that their order will be either 1) free 2) fixed or 3) meaningfully
321Hvariable. The possibility of free ordering may be immediately discarded, for reasons
which will become clear in passing. The possibility of meaningful variation can be clearly
substantiated, as will be shown below. However, the question of whether there is or is not
an underlying, more or less fixed structural template into which Galo predicate derivations
“naturally” fall, and in violation of which “marked” or ungrammatical utterances may be
said to occur, is less straightforward.
Generally speaking, all predicate dependents in Galo have leftward scope (§10.3);
321Haccordingly, only a predicate derivation which is semantically and/or functionally capable
of subsuming all leftward elements under its scope may occur on a predicate stem.
Consider the examples (416) and (422). In (416), reproduced for convenience as (421),
321H3214H3215H3216Hthe Result derivation -tɨ ́r ‘BREAK LENGTH’ precedes the Incipient Aspect/aktionsart
derivation -tà ‘INCP’; together with the root, the resulting sense is (roughly) ‘be about to
stand (on a stick, thus) breaking (it).’ The predicate derivations in this case cannot occur
in any other order, since leftward application of -tɨ ́r ‘BREAK LENGTH’ over the complexnùu-tà ‘bob.knees-INCP’ ‘be about to bob the knees’ would imply a breakage actually
resulting from an action which explicitly did not even reach inception, which is logically
nonsensical.

“Who’s going to bob their knees up and down (while standing) on this (stick),

3217H‘eat up everything’, with the overall concatenation giving the sense ‘able to eat up
everything’. Variation in the relative order of derivations here too is impossible; since the
Exhaustive derivation -ŋám ‘EXH’ explicitly references a diffuse, collectively (actually)
465affected O argument (when occurring on a transitive stem; see §11.2.5.10), it cannot have
3218Hscope over an expression denoting the potential of the A argument to bring about a
particular event. 206

whole.town-whole.world=TOP eat-EXH-ABIL-NEG-STAT=SJNC
‘It was as though everyone was unable to eat up everything.’ (NyR, MDS 068)
However, in felicitous semantic circumstances (which are admittedly rare), it ispossible to vary the order of derivations; in this case, there are clear semantic contrasts
which appear to be the outcome of scope effects. Consider (423), an example which was
3219Hconstructed on the model of the naturally-attested example (420).
320H(423) tɨɨcôo moŋâm lakè!tɨ ́ɨ-còo-mò-ŋám-là(a)=kée
imbibe-FIRST-CAUS-COLL-IPTV.SDIR=HORT.POL
‘Let us all drink first.’In (423), the Causative derivation -mò causes the underlying O argument to be
321Hunderstood as a nonvolitional Actor, i.e., a drinker. This in turn causes the Exhaustive
derivation -ŋám ‘EXH’ – which references a diffused O argument – reference a diffused
Actor. This is quite a different meaning from that of (420), in which the Causative
32Hderivation applies later in the string, and in which the Collective derivation thus has
immediate scope over the predicate root only. For more information on the valencealtering properties of the Causative derivation, see §11.2.5.3.
32HThe point to understand here is that order variation is possible under certain
circumstances, and that when it is possible, it will generally create differences in meaning
which appear principally to relate to derivational scope. For this reason, I have been
unable to date to determine any underlying structural template to which Galo predicate
derivations absolutely relate, nor have I been able to assign them to exceptionless
positional subclasses. In practice, the majority of examples in my data will agree with the
semantically-based positional template given in the first line of Figure 11.1; however, the
324Hfact of (albeit limited) variability in ordering suggests that more generalized semantic
206This difference is extremely difficult to capture in English translation, but might be understood quite
roughly as the difference between “He can eat everything” and ? “He can eat, such that everything was
affected”.","[461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466]"

A few nominal reduplications appear basically lexicalized, or at leastconventionalized in certain constructions; examples are joojòo ‘what sort’ (lit., ‘whatwhat’; cf. §7.3.5), aɨ ́i-aɨ ́ɨ ‘self-self’ ‘one another’ (§8.3), akèn-akèn ‘one-one’

2345H2346H2347HReduplication of verbs is not common. In the context of Multiword predicates, the
verbal host of a Discontinuous predicate derivation is repeated, as in rɨ ̀-nə́ rɨ ̀-bó ‘doMOVE.1 do-MOVE.2’ ‘move; budge’ (vice-versa, in the case of a Discontinuous compoundverb; the immediate verbal dependent is repeated); in such cases, however, the repetition
itself has no functional value, and thus cannot be described as reduplication in the strict
sense; see §10.5 for further discussion of Multiword predicates.
2348HRarely, a predicate derivation has been observed to undergo predicate-internal
reduplication, basically with an intensifying effect as dó-káa-lɨ ̀ɨ-lɨ ̀ɨ ‘eat-TENT-DESD-DESD’
‘really want to taste’. However, the number of predicate derivations which productively
undergo this process is extremely limited; in my data, the only attested forms are
Desiderative -lɨ ̀ɨ ‘DESD’ (§11.2.6.4), Comparative -jàa ‘COMP’ (§11.2.5.11), and
2349H2350HContinuous -bə́ə ‘DUR’ (§11.2.3.8); the process as such may represent an archaic holdover
2351Hfrom an earlier state of the language, but has little functionality and/or frequency in
modern Galo.
5.6. Word classes – summary
At the outset of this chapter (§5.1), we discussed the prototypical semantic
235Hcontents of open word classes cross-linguistically, as they have been described in several
well-known studies cited in that section. We also noted that the structural and
distributional expression of word classes, including that of various structurally and
distributionally-defined subclasses, tends to have semantic correlates. Following the
discussions of noun, adjective and verb structure and structural subtypes in §5.3, we are
235Hnow in a better position to give a preliminary statement of the grammatical expression of
288word classes in Galo, in relation to their semantic contents (Figure 5.11, to be compared
2354Hwith Figure 5.3 above).

This chapter discusses properties of Galo noun phrases (NP). §6.1 discusses NP
2356Hheadedness and constituency, and introduces the four major NP subtypes found in Galo –
common, pronominal, proper and oblique – discussing their different heads,
constituencies and syntactic functions. §6.2 discusses coordination, including NP-internal
2357Hconstituent-coordination and conjunctive and disjunctive coordination of NPs. §6.3 turns
2358Hto NP apposition, and includes discussion of the important appositional subtype referential
qualifying expressions.
6.1. Types of noun phrase, headedness, constituency and order
6.1.1. Overview
Four major types of NP are found in Galo. They differ in terms of head type,
internal constituency, and inherent referentiality. They may be defined in terms of their
respective heads (Table 6.1).
2359H1) common nominal 130
2) pronominal
3) proper name
4) temporal
129FTable 6.1 – Types of noun phraseIn terms of structure and internal constituencies, common nominal-headed NPs
offer the widest set of possibilities, while proper name-headed, pronominally-headed and
temporal NPs are in general more restricted.
In terms of referentiality, common and temporal NPs may be indefinitely or
definitely referential, according to subtype and marking. Proper and pronominal NPs are
always definitely referential. Proper name-headed NPs are uniquely referential to a known
individual in the world, while pronominally-headed NPs have shifting reference relative to
a deictic centre.","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"111towns – aalóo and daarɨ ̀ɨ – are generally known as Along and Daring respectively.
Although the Galo themselves believe this practice of “adding -ng” is due to influence
from the neighbouring Minyong (Lare Galo ɲiɲóo), it is not the case that Minyong
speakers themselves “add -ng” to open syllables; for example, the Pasigat Minyong reflex
for PTs *loŋ ‘bone’ is aloŋ, however PTs *lo ‘salt’ has the Pasigat Minyong reflex alo
(data from my field notes).
For this reason as well as for reasons which will be discussed shortly, it may be
wiser to assume that “Proto-Galo” – indeed, much like Proto-Tani – represented not one
punctual moment at which a single, uniform language was spoken, but rather a period of
relative stability, in which a group of closely related dialects (harbouring some variation
among them) had sharply diverged from other related dialects, but had not yet begun to
diverge sharply from amongst themselves.
2.4.3.5.1. Final coronal stop deletion (17)
This important ordered change affected reflexes of PTs *-t¹ and *-t²: *-t¹ was
restructured as an underspecified consonant -K, whose value is predictable according to
its environment in the word: word-finally and word-medially when preceding a vowel, it
surfaces [k]; word-medially when preceding a consonant, it fully assimilates to that
consonant (see §3.4.2). *-t² codas, on the other hand, simply dropped off. Informally, *-t¹
→ Ci / _ Ci ; → k / else. *-t² → Ø.
Note that Final coronal stop deletion must be ordered after Vowel fronting 1 and 2,
because it removes one conditioning environment for those changes (Table 2.20).

This ordered change, while perhaps unremarkable to a linguist, is the single most
important change in Galo historical phonology from the point of view of Galo speakers,
112insofar as it represents to them the most salient phonological feature distinguishing Galo
from the Eastern Tani languages. As mentioned in §2.4.3.5, Galo frequently refer to the
nearby Minyong and Mising as people who “add -ng” to words in which it should not
occur. Although some syllable-final engmas have been secondarily reintroduced into Galo
(particularly in the Pugo dialect) via word-internal assimilation processes, no wordfinal -ŋ codas have been observed among native Galo lexemes, and neither would there
seem to be any signs of secondary reintroduction word-finally.
In this change, syllable-final -ŋ was deleted, leaving a compensatorily lengthened
vowel in its stead; schematically: -Viŋ → -ViVi. Note that Final velar nasal deletion must
be ordered after əə/oo-shortening (§2.4.3.4.3), because it creates secondary [əə] sequences
which would have been subject to əə/oo-shortening, but were not (Table 2.21).","[111, 112, 113]"
"68514.1.3. Grammatical relations
In Galo, we find fairly robust evidence for the grammaticalization of “subject”, in
the standard sense of S/A alignment in opposition to other core argument roles. 265
264FIndependent evidence for the grammatical relation “object” is less robust, due mainly to
differences in the extent to which E arguments align with or are distinct from O
arguments when considered from various grammatical perspectives. The following
subsections §14.1.3.1-§14.1.3.7 review areas of Galo grammar in which the grammatical
4198H419Hrelation of subject is manifest and/or recognizable, as well as some in which grammatical
relations might perhaps be expected to be reflected, but seem not to be. In them, I
informally refer to O as constituting an “object” relation in opposition to “subject”.
§14.1.3.8 then discusses grammatical treatment of O and E arguments in more detail,
420Haddressing the question of whether one or more independently-identifiable “object”
relations may be said to exist in Galo, or not.
Before proceeding, it may have been noted that at various points in this grammar,
mention has been made of grammatical features which seemingly reference S and O, but
not A (as with certain Result predicate derivations; see §11.2), as well as O and obliques,
4201Hand sometimes S, but not A (as with predicate-collocated nominals and/or “incorporation”;
see §5.3.2.1 and §14.2.2.2). Such groupings seem not to be describable as “grammatical
420H4203Hrelations” (interesting though they are on their own terms), inasmuch as they do not
interact with basic techniques in the language for determining the relationship of main
clause arguments to a predicate; accordingly, such groupings will not be mentioned
further in what follows.
14.1.3.1. Evidence from main clause relational marking
In a prototypical Galo transitive clause, in which the predicate is headed by a
lexically transitive verb and in which both A and O argument noun phrases are definite,
referential and overtly represented, identification of noun phrase functions is a trivial
matter: O is obligatorily marked in the accusative, and A is unmarked (846)-(848).
420H2654205HI am aware that an older “standard” view held “subject” to refer to the noun phrase “outside of VP”
(Chomsky 1965) (or that “immediately dominated by IP” (Haegeman 1991), which says basically the same
thing) and “object” to refer to the noun phrase “dominated by VP” . That is not the sense intended here.","[685, 686]"
"581.2.10.2. Notable linguistic features
1.2.10.2.1. Disconnect between “grammatical” and “phonological” words
In Galo, it is not always possible to clearly or consistently correlate grammatical
and phonological criteria for “word”-hood. That is, although we can independently
develop clear and consistent grammatical and phonological criteria for recognizing a unit
“word”, these may, or may not, converge on identification of the same unit. Generally
speaking, grammatical word-hood is defined in terms of a composition of grammatical
head plus any immediate morphological (grammatical) dependents. Phonological wordhood is in turn defined in terms of a variety of phenomena, including prosodic
specifications (single metrical foot with single stress, single surface TBU with single
tonal value and contour…) segmental specifications (boundary effects, internal
assimilation sandhi, external phonotactics…) and so on. Following these definitions,
grammatical and phonological words may line up; for example, takèk ‘body dirt’ is “a
word” according to both grammatical and phonological criteria. Or, one grammatical
word may contain two (or more) phonological words: záp-làk-dùu-kú ‘talk-CAP-IPFVCMPL’ ‘starting to be able to talk’ is realized zablâk duukù (note the operation ofregressive voicing assimilation across the first, phonological-word-internal, suffix
boundary, but not the second, cross-phonological-word, suffix boundary). On the other
hand, one phonological word may contain two grammatical words. Two monosyllabic
postpositions, or a postposition plus a particle, which occur in immediate sequence and
which constitute a well-formed metrical foot may be realized as a single phonological
word, as bə́=cìn ‘DAT=ADD’, which may be realized bəcìn. For further discussion, see
§4.1.
1.2.10.2.2. “Double case” and “functor fusion”
As was mentioned in §1.2.10.1.6, it is common to find usually disyllabic
sequences in Galo which either reflect a sequence of case markers/postpositions which is
compositional/productive in modern Galo, or which (probably more often) reflects an
earlier compositionality which has since fused into an indivisible unit. An example of a
modern compositional case sequence is əəm=nè ‘ACC=NAGT’, a sequence which marks
both O argument NPs and Irrealis temporal phrases (i.e., ‘at lunchtime tomorrow’).
Compositionality is certain in this case since the Non-agentive marker is not obligatory,
59but adds a basically intensifying value to the expression. An example of a modern
disyllabic postposition which cannot be analysed as compositional in modern Galo (but
which almost certainly was compositional at an earlier stage) is lokə̀ ‘ABL; PART’.
Deriving almost certainly from the sequence *lo ‘LOC’ + *kə̀ ‘GEN’, *kə̀ no longer occurs
as a phrase-level genitive enclitic in Galo, having seemingly lenited to form the current
Genitive enclitic gə. An earlier Genitive *kə̀ is reflected in the Galo pronominal Genitive
suffix -kə̀ ‘GEN’, as in ŋó-kə̀ ‘1.SG-GEN’ ‘my’, as well as in the general Pagro Mising
(pronominal and noun phrasal) Genitive (k)kə.
However, it is also possible to find cases which are difficult to clearly identify as
compositional or fused. An example is lobə ‘LMT.RANGE’ which has the basic Dumessive
sense ‘until (a give point within a range)’, as in luuɲɨ ̀ɨ lobə ‘next.year LMT.RANGE’ ‘until
next year’. Clearly deriving from the simplex postpositions lo ‘LOC’ and bə́ ‘DAT’, and
deriving its semantic value directly from the semantic values of its formatives (lo ‘LOC’
can mark future/irrealis time nouns, and bə́ ‘DAT’ often marks Extensive noun phrases as
a limit in quantity, scope or range), there would appear to be a good argument for
continuing compositionality. Furthermore, the Dative postposition could be removed,
leaving luuɲɨ ̀ɨ=lo ‘next.year=LOC’ ‘(in) next year’, which would seemingly clinch the
argument. However, it is also possible to mark luuɲɨ ̀ɨ ‘next year’ in the Non-agentive nè
(in an irrealis punctual temporal marking sense). In this case, it is no longer possible to
subsequently mark the expression in lo ‘LOC’ *luuɲɨ ̀ɨ=nè=lo
‘next.year=IRR.TMP.PUNC=LOC’. However, it is possible to use the range-limiting
postposition: luuɲɨ ̀ɨ=nè=lobə ‘next.year=IRR.TMP.PUNC=LMT.RANGE’ ‘until exactly next
year’. Thus, it would seem that in at least some if not all functions, lobə ‘LMT.RANGE’
must be analysed as a fused unit; this and all similar phenomena must be approached and
tested on a case-by-case basis.lobə ‘LMT.RANGE’ illustrates a case of earlier postposition + postposition
composition. Additional examples of seeming “functor fusion” with different
compositional values include gobə ‘LMT.UNIT’ (< go ‘IND’ + bə́ ‘DAT’, article +
postposition), bolò ‘DST.LOC.DOWN’ (< bə̀ ‘DST.DOWN’ + lo ‘LOC’, demonstrative +
60postposition), bəree ‘CJEC’ (< bə́ ‘DAT’ + ree ‘PQ’, postposition + particle) and -gərə́
‘ACNC’ (< -gə́ ‘COMT’ (?) + -rə́ ‘IRR’ (predicate derivation + predicate inflection). Many
more such examples will be adduced in passing throughout this work.
1.2.10.2.3. Classification
Galo exploits the semantics of classification in an unusually wide range of
grammatical domains. In addition to a large system of numeral classifiers, which combine
with both numerals and certain types of adjective to form enumerative and adjectival
classifier expressions – Galo makes extensive use of a classificatory “generic-specific”
template in word- and phrase-formation. For example, in lɨɨpùm ‘stone pile fish trap’, the
initial formative root lɨ ̀ɨ- ‘stone’ denotes a class of entity – things to do with stones – andpùm- ‘pile’ narrows the denotation to a specific class member. Often, the second
formative may be repeated in a “root-pivotal” construction to form the classificatory head
of a second term, as lɨ ̀ɨ-pùm=pùm-ɲì ‘stone-pile=pile-two’ ‘two stone piles’. The
classificatory principle applies at two levels in such constructions. On the root level, lɨ ̀ɨ‘stone’ and pùm- ‘pile’ each stand as generic initial formatives within the grammatical
words lɨɨpùm ‘stone pile’ and pumɲì ‘two piles’, while pùm- ‘pile’ and ɲì- ‘two’ stand as
specific final formatives. On the word level, lɨɨpùm ‘stone pile fish trap’ stands as a
generic formative, denoting the concept of a type of entity in the world, while pumɲì ‘two
piles’ stands as a specific formative, fixing the overall reference in terms of a set of
individuals. In many such types of word- and phrase-formation in Galo, the semantic
concept of “classification” describes the underlying structure of linear arrangements more
insightfully than would a more generalized, semantically-vague concept of
“modification”
1.2.10.2.4. Use of noun phrase relational/case markers in clause-subordination
As in many other Tibeto-Burman languages, Galo makes use of noun phrase
relational/case markers in clause-subordination. In certain types of clause-subordination,
such as framing nominalizations (=tail-head linkages), the clause is quite clearly
nominalized, and bears a noun phrase Topic marker in conjunction with its occurrence in
61a pre-clausal “topic slot” in the syntax; such cases are perhaps unremarkable. In other
types of clause-subordination, such as temporal/episodic subordination (when John
arrived…), the clause is fully finite/inflected (in non-perfective aspects only), but is
marked by a subordinating posposition such as lo ‘LOC’, and occurs in the syntactic
position normally reserved for temporal or locative noun phrases. In most subtypes of
temporal/episodic subordination, the subject is obligatorily in the Genitive; however, the
predicate is not nominalized at the word-level, and there are no other indications of a
nominalization-like clause structure. In most cases of temporal/episodic clausesubordination, the semantic value of the subordinating postposition is identical, or at least
quite close, to its semantic value in oblique noun phrase-marking. The oblique noun
phrase-marking/clause-subordinating syncretism even extends to seemingly idiosyncratic
conventions which might not have been expected to necessarily occur in all available
environments. For example, as was also mentioned in §1.2.10.2.2, the “double case”
sequence əəm=nè ‘ACC=NAGT” marks an O argument under a more or less intensive
(highly affected as a participant, or well-individuated as a referent) construal. In temporal
noun phrase marking, the same sequence əəm=nè ‘ACC=NAGT’ marks an Irrealis time
nominal as highly precise in reference, as “in exactly next year (at no other time)”. Again,
the same sequence marks an Irrealis/Hypothetical clause-subordination, as nócàa-rə́=əəm=nè ‘2.SG ascend-IRR=ACC=NAGT’ ‘right when/if you go up…’. In all three
cases, use of the Non-agentive marker is optional, and serves to intensify the reference.
1.2.10.2.5. Predicate derivations
Galo has an extremely large and productive set (more than 320 members) of
predicate derivations, or bound predicate stem-expanding formatives. Possibly deriving
diachronically from proto-verb-serialization at the VP or sentence level, the modern
system of Galo predicate derivations is entirely predicate word-internal. Applying with
leftward scope over a predicate stem in an only partially-variable order (due to semantic
scope restrictions), predicate derivations perform a wide array of modifying functions,
listed in §1.2.10.1.4 above. The wide availability of predicate derivations has a profound
effect on the organization of Galo grammar. Many functions coded by auxiliary verbs or
serial verbs in other languages (such as modality, including concepts such as
want/need/must, or try to) are handled by predicate derivations in Galo. In addition, many
complex event-construals which are lexicalized as single words in other languages, such
62as kill (to cause someone to die) are handled compositionally in Galo, as mò-kə̀ ‘makeDEAD’ (reflecting the composition VROOT-PDER). Also many abstract concepts such astime or manner are not lexicalized in Galo, but instead are handled by nominalizing
predicate derivations, as mèn-kór ‘speak-NZR:MANNER’ ‘way of talking’. Accordingly, it
is not possible in Galo to form periphrastic expressions such as ‘their ways of talking’, in
which ‘way’ and ‘talk’ can be independently modified; rather, the composition is entirely
word-internal.
1.2.11. Number of speakers and degree of endangerment
By comparison with many languages, both in North-East India and elsewhere in
the world, Galo’s degree of endangerment is not high. Access to the Galo area, and
indeed most areas of Arunachal Pradesh, remains tightly restricted by the Government of
India; and since the Galo remain overwhelmingly dominant in their area, their language is
spoken daily and learned as a first language by a majority of children (though certainly
not by all). No reliable survey on the number of Galo speakers (as opposed to Galo
tribespeople, who do not always speak Galo) has to date been conducted. The 1981
Census of India put the number of “Adi Gallong” tribespeople at 8,999 (Hussain 1995).
However, the 1991 census puts the figure at a bursting 45,616! This increase is clearly not
solely due to population growth, but rather reflects the extreme difficulties of demarcating
tribal and linguistic categories in North-East India, and the absence of any effective or
commonly agreed-upon means for doing so. Depending on where lines are drawn, based
on the current population of the “scheduled tribes” of West Siang district, 84,922 (West
Siang District Economics and Statistics Deptartment 2004) – the number of Galo speakers
may be estimated at around 30,000-40,000 (or more, depending on where lines are drawn)
with at least half of them being speakers of some form of Lare. These are relatively
healthy-looking numbers when one considers that historically, the number of Galo
speakers must have been much lower.
However, changes in this comfortable status quo are already apparent. With
improvements in communication, economic opportunities, and the reach of regional,
national and even international media into Arunachal Pradesh, Galo are increasingly
relying on more widely spoken Indo-European languages – usually Hindi and Assamese,
but also English – when leaving their immediate home surroundings. Families who can
afford to invariably send their children away to boarding schools at an early age, since
good quality government schools are not found in most Arunachali localities. These often
63religiously-oriented boarding schools often actively discourage use of a child’s native
language (sometimes punishing those who speak their native language with their peers),
with the result that children attending such boarding schools end up spending the bulk of
their childhood speaking Hindi; naturally, such children will tend to control this language
better than their “native” language by the time they are young adults. Complex
technological or novel objects are invariably named in English or Hindi rather than in
Galo. In certain Assamese contact areas in the foothills, loanword use is often extreme, to
the point where native grammar has come to largely provide a partial shell for an almost
wholly borrowed lexicon.
While this is not an unusual phenomenon among the tribal languages of India (and
elsewhere), it is also perhaps not desirable from the point of view of the preservation of
North-East Indian cultural heritage, and the preservation and vibrancy of Galo culture in
particular. The structures of Galo and Indo-European grammars are vastly different, and
are in many important ways incompatible; often, to adopt a borrowed structure is not to
alternate with the native structure, but rather to replace it.
To take a simple example, it is practically impossible to integrate borrowed verb
roots into the Galo system of morphological verb stem expansions (i.e. predicate
derivations), due to differences in the semantic and functional ranges handled lexically
and derivationally in Galo and in Indo-European languages. English check (VT.) – a
frequently borrowed word – lexically incorporates the ‘Tentative’ aspect for which an
independent native form -káa ‘TENT’ exists in Galo (thus, English check is most closely
translated by the bi-morphemic Galo expression káa-káa- ‘look-TENT’ (§11.2.3.1)). With
aspect already lexically encoded by the loanword, native stem-expanding aspect markers
not only are not used, they cannot be used: *cék-káa- ‘check-TENT’ is unacceptable. In
this sense, use of a loaned verb does not simply substitute one word for another – a
relatively benign and common enough thing in any language – it actually precludes use of
an entire swathe of Galo grammar. To take a different sort of example, the relatively low
salience and variability of tones in Galo means that many young people with limited
exposure to their native language do not learn the tone system perfectly. Such speakers
have been observed to deliberately and consciously use loanwords to replace one or more
terms which are homophonous to them, but which in their parents’ speech are minimal
pairs on tone. The speech of some young Galo in high Indic contact areas may be
described as almost completely atonal and, in this as well as in other ways, partially
unintelligible unless loanwords are used.
64Historically, the Galo are now at a turning point. There is no shortage of expert
speakers in every Galo-dominated area, and given the relatively large number of Galo
people and tight integration of their communities, there is every hope that the Galo
language will continue to be spoken far into the future. However, making this hope a
reality will require attention and efforts which must begin to be made today. This
grammar, and the accompanying dictionary still in preparation, represent an initial step in
the development of materials which will aid in preservation and maintenance of the Galo
language. But to ensure the future of the language, we need writing conventions,
textbooks, literature, websites, audiovisual materials, and above all, a broad awareness
among young Galo of what is actually at stake – in the case of Galo, it is nothing less than
the survival and vibrancy of a unique and complex language and culture which dates back
hundreds if not thousands of years – and which could be substantially and irretrievably
altered, if not lost, at the mere drop of a historical hat.
1.3. Previous studies of the Galo and their language
As already noted, this is the first large-scale study of Galo grammar yet attempted.
In fact, very little serious linguistic or anthropological work of any scale has yet been
conducted in Arunachal Pradesh. A more complete review of the major works attempted
over the last 150 years on Tani languages more generally may be found in Sun
(1993:§1.4). Here we review only those works with direct reference to Galo.
An Introduction to the Gallong Language by Das Gupta (1963) appears to have
been written for the benefit of non-local Indian Government administrators who were
posted in the Galo area at that time. As a book explicitly written for “everyday use”, it has
proven to be of extremely limited value to linguists (to say nothing of the Galo people
themselves). This is due as much to the almost innumerable errors of transcription,
grammaticality, translation, and interpretation (often enough, all four) which are found in
nearly every sentence example presented as it is to the author’s consciously haphazard
admixture of at least three phonologically and grammatically divergent Galo dialects
throughout the work. In short, it is an almost completely unreliable work both from the
point of view of data and analysis, and has had no discernible impact on local
development of the Galo language. Nevertheless, it has a certain historical value as the
first ever published work (so far as I am aware) on Galo, and may for all I know have in
fact served the specific community and purpose for which it was designed well enough.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"

‘tongue’ in Table 2.13) had important consequences for the future development of Galo
dialects. Informally, *C → Ø / [-son] _.
Note that Initial cluster simplification 2 cannot be grouped with Initial cluster
simplification 1; unlike Initial cluster simplification 1, Initial cluster simplification 2 must
be ordered after Regressive palatalization, since it created PPG *Ci and *Ce sequences
which would have been subject to Regressive palatalization, but were not (such as

This fairly uniform-looking change probably actually involved a series of ordered
changes which occurred differently, over time, across many Tani languages. It affected
most vowels preceding coronals *-n and *-t1. The importance of Sun’s (1993b) *-t1/*-t2
distinction 41 becomes clear for the first time during this change, because *-t2 in most
(probably all) cases was not a conditioning environment.
The main patterns found are *a, *o → e / _ *n, *t1 and *ɨ, *u → i / _ *-t¹; however,
*ɨ → i / _ *n, only; *u was unaffected here (see ‘wound’ in Table 2.14). *ən and *ət
sequences are unattested and sparsely attested respectively; however, there is evidence
that insofar as they occurred, they followed the shift to e (see ‘lie down’ in Table 2.14).
It is necessary to order the changes in terms of the vowels affected, because of an
intermediate Raising change which affected some but not all of the conditions that would
have been available if the changes were uniform. In particular, *e sporadically raised to i
following labials, affecting, for example, both PTs *me sequences and PPG *me*-t1 and *-t2 indicate proto-forms with t reflexes in some languages, but with different reflexes in other
languages, and for which evidence is insufficient to reconstruct the precise nature of the proto-difference.
However, Sun (1993b) speculates, and I agree, that the most likely form for *-t1 is *-ɕ. For discussion of the
41unusual behaviour of the modern Lare Galo *-t1 reflex, see §3.4.2.","[107, 108]"
"94may have appeared in. Therefore, while phonological changes certainly introduced
contrasts among previously homophonous roots across two different languages or dialects
– increasing the diversity of the Tani languages as a whole – they did not, in general,
introduce much opacity among roots within a given language. This fact may help explain
why the at least potential cognitive reality of roots as combinatorial elements seems to
have lingered in Tani languages like Galo long after the lexicon overall had shifted
toward a larger basic lexical word shape: an overall persistence in phonological continuity
kept the patterns of root distribution available for analysis and creative exploitation.
At the same time, however, certain other types of changes began to occur, both at
pre-Proto-Galo and post-Proto-Galo stages, which operated on the level of the
polysyllabic word. This meant that phonological discontinuities began to be introduced
among iterations of certain roots in different word-positions. While these sorts of changes
were relatively few, they have potentially far-reaching implications for the extent to
which language learners (as well as linguists!) are able to analyse etymologically-related
forms as being synchronically related.
The following sections review these changes. A chronological approach is taken
as far as possible; however, not all of the changes observed provide evidence of ordering,
and indeed, certain of them seem to more closely resemble ongoing, cyclical processes
which recur time and time again. A more precise set of ordering hypotheses will only
become possible when more and better comparative Tani language data are made
available.
2.4.2. Pre-Proto-Tani
There is very little evidence available to shed light on the nature of any postProto-Tibeto-Burman, pre-Proto-Tani ancestor language(s). The nearest languages likely
to be relatable are the “Mishmi” languages Idu, Digaru and Miju (in that order); 36
certainly, there are strong lexical and morphological resemblances between Mishmi and
Tani languages, as well as close cultural resemblances and of course areal proximity to
consider. However, due largely to the ongoing lack of reliable Mishmi data it is not
currently possible to state whether these resemblances are more likely to be (or to be
primarily) owing to common ancestry, to substrate influence (on one side or the other), or
simply past and, in a few areas, ongoing contact.","[94, 95]"

Word-final weakening. Most prominent among them is Speaker-proximate Individuative

in a metrically weak position, but variation among [dɨ ~ də] is observed in metrically
strong positions. Finally, the lexeme goŋkù ‘classical language’ irregularly retains short
final -u, probably “iconically”, in some sense, reflecting the conservative function ofgoŋkù itself in Galo society (cf. §1.2.6).
2.4.4.6. Intervocalic glide deletion (23)
This ordered change is very well-attested in Pugo (cf. ‘pig’ in Table 2.24 above)
and found to a limited extent in Lare, but is not found in some other Galo dialects, such as
116the highly conservative taíi(podia) dialect of the Assam border area to the West of lɨɨkàa-balíi. In this change, a palatal glide is deleted inter-vocalically, when preceding a palatal
vowel i or e. Note that Intervocalic glide deletion must be ordered after Palatal fronting
and raising, since Palatal fronting and raising (both varieties) creates [ji] and [je]
sequences which are subject to Intervocalic glide deletion. Note also that Intervocalic
glide deletion occurs at the word level rather than at the syllable level (Table 2.26).

created numerous environments which qualified for Intervocalic glide deletion which
were not created in Lare. Among the affected forms identified to date are the Additive
concessive suffix (Lare -gərə́ ‘ACNC’, Pugo -gée ‘ACNC’) (§16.4.4.3), Conjectural particle
(§13.3.3.4) (Lare bəree ‘CJEC’, Pugo bee ‘CJEC’) and Dubitative particle (§13.3.3.2) (Larelaree ‘DUB’, Pugo lee ‘DUB’). Although the grammatical categories which these forms
mark remain, as far as I can see, basically identical, the phonological differences which
now exist sometimes create difficulties in cross-dialectal comprehension.","[116, 117]"
"69114.1.3.7. Non-occurrence of passive
By “passive”, I understand a marked morphosyntactic operation of
detransitivization, in which the object is “raised” to subject position, and in which the
notional subject (underlying A) is expressed, or is expressible, as an oblique (Dixon 1994:
146). The presence of a passive construction in a language is often taken as strong
evidence for grammaticalization of and/or functional use of the grammatical relations of
“subject” and “object”. In Galo, however, despite relatively robust evidence for subject as
outlined in above sections, there is no marked syntactic construction in which a notional
subject is expressed or expressible as a main-clause-level oblique noun phrase, hence no
morphosyntactic “passive” as such. There are derivational operations which appear to
operate at the word level on the argument structure of predicates and the semantic roles
which are assigned to them, enabling semantic interpretations which render them

26Foutlined above. 268
267F14.1.3.8. O and E arguments and the grammatical relation(s) of “object”
Above subsections reviewed evidence for the grammatical relation “subject” in
terms of intransitive and transitive clause types, using “object” as an informal label for the
syntactic realization of O. Turning to clause types with extended core argument structures,
however, the evidence for “object” becomes somewhat less categorical.
In an extended transitive clause headed by a predicate in zí- ‘give’ – or else
derived by the related Benefactive applicative -zí – both O and E arguments are typically
marked in the accusative (865).
4235HCf. especially the ‘Reversive’ suffix -kò (§11.2.5.8), which has the effect of causing the argument roles
of A and O to be reversed (schematically, I hit-ko him, in which ‘him’ is understood as Agent and ‘I’ as
Patient). However, predicate marking in -kò seems to have no syntactic consequences at all, hence is not a
“passivizing” morpheme.
268
I do not take the absence of a passive in Galo to argue against the relevance of passive constructions to
the description of grammatical relations in general. Rather, I would say that simply having the grammatical
relation “subject” does not in itself predict the presence of a passive. Inasmuch as a language may have one
or more other means of expressing a transitive non-actor in subject position, as is the case in Galo, there
may simply be no functional pressure to grammaticalize a true passive construction.

could represent a relatively recent innovation. That claim notwithstanding, accusative-marking of E
arguments in ‘give’ type clauses is overwhelmingly more frequent than dative-marking in my data, and
seems quite independent of speaker age or geographical background; of course, a larger and more diverse

Another way of interpreting these data would be to suggest that (868) is not an internally-headed
relativization at all, but rather represents a variety of incorporation of the O argument noun phrase into the
grammatical predicate. The fact remains that E does not appear to have access to this operation (cf.
§15.3.1.3.2).","[691, 692, 693]"

[là(a)-dùu]AUX]PRED
can-IPFVIn all syntactic theories of which I am aware, “auxiliary verb” is treated as a
syntactic word, whether viewed as a constituent of the predicate or verb (Chomsky 1971
[1957]), predicate/verb phrase (Chomsky 1965) or sentence (Haegeman 1991). It is never,
so far as I am aware, construed as a syntactic word in some cases and an internal
constituent of another word – i.e. an affix, which would no longer be referred-to by
syntactic rules – in other cases. Among functional characterizations, Givón (2001
[1984]:§7) identifies “auxiliary verbs” as a small subset of verbs (in most languages
which have them), occupying a particular position in a specific diachronic process of
grammaticalization, viz. MAIN VERB > AUXILIARY > TAM MARKER > TAM AFFIX, and
similar (though more detailed) characterizations are given by Heine (1993). Thus,
although there is expected to be a particular point in the process when the auxiliary has
shed most of its erstwhile verbal properties and begins to be subsumed under another
syntactic word (generally, though perhaps not necessarily, the main verb), by the time it
occurs as a bound local dependent it is no longer referred-to by the term “auxiliary”; i.e.,
it is now a “TAM affix”.
To summarize, I understand the category “auxiliary verb” to include syntactic
words which are diachronically derived from main verbs, which are undergoing specific
processes of grammaticalization, and which are (therefore, probably) expected to be few
in number. I do not understand it to indifferently include suffixes, bound formatives and
free words, nor to designate terms which have the capacity to surface sometimes as a
suffix, and sometimes as a word, and I would not expect there to be a large or
indeterminate number of auxiliary verbs in a language for which they are identified.
Recall, then, that within a Galo predicate complex, the predicate derivation -là(a)
‘ABIL’ may either occur as a phonologically and grammatically bound dependent of a verb,
as in (424), or as a phonologically unbound but, as I will maintain, grammatically bound
325Hdependent of the same verb as in (425)/(430). Even if one were to dispute the idea of -là(a)
325H3254H472being grammatically bound in (425)/(430), one could not, it seems to me, dispute it in the
325H3256Hcase of (424) (since it appears to license a term which is grammatically bound, and must
3257Htherefore presumably be grammatically bound itself). Thus, analysing -là(a) as an
auxiliary verb head in (425)/(430) would require us to state that Galo auxiliary verbs head
3258H3259Hgrammatically free terms in some cases, and are grammatical dependents of other terms
in other cases. This is not theoretically impossible, perhaps, but it would, in the specific
case of “auxiliary verbs”, amount to a radical re-conception of the meaning of this term
and of the type of syntactic object it could represent. Worse, it would necessitate
specifying that the motivation for the surfacing of -là(a) as a free word head as opposed to
a bound dependent is nothing more than the fact that another morpheme (in the case of
(425)/(430), the Result derivation -kák) happened to be occurring in its designated
3260H3261Hdependent slot. This would strike me as a syntactically sloppy and poorly-motivated
analysis.
Furthermore, adopting the second analysis illustrated in (430) would necessitate
326Hpositing an indefinitely large number of “auxiliary verb heads” in Galo, for the simple
reason that any bound dependent of the predicate occurring in the third syllable position
would then be subject to analysis as the head of an auxiliary verb. Consider the examples
in Table 11.1.

3264Hand the principal arguments against analyzing them in the first column as bound
dependents and in the second column as auxiliary verb heads are, I hope, by now clear.
Finally, we may note that it is never possible to extract forms such as ladù in
(425)/(430) or lɨɨdù or kendù in Table 11.1 from their position in the predicate complex
3265H326H3267H(fronting them before the verb, for example, as *ŋó ladù rɨkkák). Nor is it possible for
473most types of syntactic word or particle to intervene, e.g., between rɨkkák and lɨɨdù in
Table 11.1, or any similar arrangement (for an overview of important exceptions to this
3268Hgeneralization, see §13.5).

serialization” analysis
Some readers, while perhaps conceding an argument against analysis of predicate
derivations as auxiliary verb heads, might be unconvinced that they are not in fact serial
verbs. In this analysis, (425)/(430) might be reanalysed as in (431), with V1 standing as
3270H3271H327Hsemantic head of the predicate, but depending syntactically on V2. This closely recalls the
syntax of most Mainland South-East Asian languages, such as Standard Thai (432).

The changes in these stages are easily ordered with respect to other stages, but are
extremely difficult to order among themselves; it is possible that they were occurring
more or less simultaneously over a period of time, or among closely related dialects in
which some dialect mixing may have led to irregularities. However, most of the data
agree with the ordering represented here.
2.4.3.4.1. Initial cluster simplification 2 (10)
This ordered change occurred widely in the Tani area, affecting all the Eastern
languages, though not some Western languages such as Apatani. It removed the glide
position from all obstruent-initial syllables (such as ‘steal’ and ‘ginger’ in Table 2.13).
Since nasal-glide sequences had earlier reduced to PPG *ɲ- via palatalization rules (cf.
§2.4.3.3), this change effectively left PPG *rj- as the last remaining exemplar of the PPG
40The sequences **gi, **ŋe and **ŋj- are not attested in my data. Note also that the change PTs *mj- →PPG *ɲ- could also be understood as →*nj-, which would be formally simpler since it retains a cluster(which is later removed following obstruents, but not sonorants). This would introduce homophonous [nj]
and [ɲ] elements in the PPG segment inventory which, while not an absolute phonological absurdity
(though it would seem to be phonetically absurd), would require expanding the modern Lare syllable canon
by one position. It is simpler to assume a global condition, not presented here in the interest of brevity (and
since it is fairly self-evident), in which [nj] sequences automatically reduce to [ɲ].","[106, 107]"
"54two classes render them clearly distinct. Numerals, classifiers, relator nouns and
qualifying nouns all closely resemble lexical nouns in terms of structure and semantics,
and may be used as lexical NP-heads in certain conditions. However, all may also occur in
post-head modifying functions, which lexical nouns ordinarily cannot do; in terms of their
post-head modifying functions, they seem to constitute closed classes.
Articles and postpositions are closely related and are in complementary
distribution in many functions. Both articles and postpositions also bear resemblances to
certain types of demonstrative, with which they are sometimes paradigmatically related.
For example, the set of “demonstrative postpositions” includes true demonstratives which,
however, also accomplish postpositional functions; for example, aló ‘Distal locative
(same/unknown level)’. Despite these similarities, articles, demonstratives and
postpositions can all be clearly distinguished from one another in terms of their core
distributional properties.
Functional classes of the predicate complex include predicate derivations and
predicate inflections. Predicate derivations constitute a very large class of bound,
predicate stem-expanding formatives which handle a wide array of modifying functions,
including manner, result, purpose, direction, modality, aspect/aktionsart, class change,
and valence rearrangement/change. Predicate inflections are suffixes marking polarity,
aspect, modality, and (to a very limited extent) evidentiality, as well as (again, to a limited
extent) “conjunct/disjunct” subject person-agreement.
Functional classes of the clause include a wide array of particles, most of which
either occur clause-finally or noun-phrase-finally, but some of which may occur in a wide
range of syntactic positions, often with different scope effects. Noun-phrase-final
particles generally mark inter-clausal referential-continuity values, such as contrast, while
clause-final particles primarily mark epistemic status of propositions and illocutionary
force. Most types of particle have the ability to act as a “focus particle”, marking the focal
constituent of a cleft/focus construction. Additional functional classes at the clause level
include coordinating and hesitating particles – most of which derive from demonstratives
– as well as interjections.
1.2.10.1.5. Clause types and clause structure
Clauses are either main (independent) or dependent. Main clauses are predicative
or appositive. Dependent clause types are all based on predicative clauses. Appositive55clauses cannot be subordinated or otherwise made to depend on another clause, and do
not in general host dependent clauses within their structure.
A main predicative clause obligatorily consists of a predicate plus its arguments,
and may also include one or more oblique noun phrases, adverbials, and/or syntactically
embedded dependent clauses. Noun phrase arguments may be followed by “Referential
qualifying expressions”, which are appositive phrasal modifiers with the same argument
function as the modified NP (i.e., a Referential qualifying expression which follows an
Accusative-marked O NP will also be Accusative-marked). Predicate arguments may be
freely ellipsed if pragmatically recoverable, but are always logically/underlyingly present.
Transitivity is a robust feature of the Galo predicate, and is projected by the inherent,
lexically-specified transitivity of the verbal or adjectival predicate head, following any
alterations to basic transitivity made by one or more valence-rearranging/altering
predicate derivations. Most predicate arguments are noun phrases, although a small
number of clause complement-taking predicate types are also found, usually with nonprototypical constructional properties.
Appositive clauses are either verbless clauses, or copula clauses. Both types
structurally consist of an equative or attributive apposition of two core arguments; while
verbless clauses lack an obligatory predicating element, copula clauses are obligatorily
headed by one of two uninflecting, non-verbal copulas (imperfective and perfective). In
addition, while verbless clauses take only noun phrase arguments, in a copula clause the
focal argument (Copula Complement) may be headed either by a nominal or by an
adjectival.
Dependent clause types include non-final clauses (=medial, co-subordinate),
temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses, adverbially-subordinated clauses,
complement clauses, and nominalized clauses:
Non-final clauses form clause chains, and often consist of large numbers of nonrecursively-embedded, non-final-marked clauses, followed by a single final clause.
Normally, each clause of a clause chain denotes an independent event, with the overall
chain usually denoting a thematically-connected chain of events in a narrative or
procedural description. The final clause is obligatorily headed by a final (inflected)
predicate, while inflection of non-final clause heads is relatively limited. There is no
grammaticalized subject-continuity constraint in Galo clause-chains, although samesubject and switch-subject constructions are available for use in contexts of high
referential density. Complex predicates are formed using the same basic structure as a
clause chain, but exhibit more tightly-restricted constructional properties, and are (in
56some if not all cases clearly) monoclausal. Subjects of clause chains are zero-marked
(Nominative).
Temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses consist of final, inflected
predicative clauses in non-perfective aspects only (including irrealis), which are
individually (non-recursively, non-continuously) subordinated to a main predicative
clause via one of a variety of postpositions. Temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses
usually give contextual information (such as temporal or hypothetical content), and are
often marked by the same types of postposition that would mark a semantically-relatable
nominal (such as a time noun) in the same syntactic position. Subjects of most types of
temporally/episodically-subordinated clauses are Genitive.
Adverbially-subordinated clauses are recursively embedded in a main clause, and
consist of several subtypes with different types of head, different preferred syntactic
positions, and different subordinate/main clause coreferentiality constraints. Generally
speaking, subordinate clause subjects which are syntactically ellipsed tend strongly to be
coreferential with main clause subjects, particularly when the subordinate clause follows
the higher clause subject in the surface syntax (i.e., when it is “surface embedded”).
However, subordinate/main clause subject-coferentiality may be overridden either by
overt subject use (with subordinate clause subjects once again in the Genitive) or via
“disjunct” cross-clause coreference-constraining marking, or both.
Complement clauses are clearly identifiable as a structural type or types, but are
relatively less important than other dependent clause types in the overall organization of
Galo grammar. “Direct contents” complement clauses of cognition and locution are not
overtly marked for dependency, but are identifiable in terms of the structure of the overall
clause in which they appear. Modal complements of purpose and intention are marked by
a complementizing predicate suffix.
Nominalized clauses are rich in Galo as in most Tibeto-Burman languages, and
exhibit the usual TB nominalization-relativization syncretism. Four “primary”
nominalization/relativization types are found, some of which are polyfunctional: 1)
Subject 2) Realis event (action)/Non-subject 3) Irrealis event (action)/Non-subject 4)
Locative/Oblique. Each may occur in headless, externally-headed and internally-headed
relative clause types, although the internally-headed type exhibits certain structural
restrictions (on all four nominalization types). Relativization may be on any major main
clause constituent, including all core arguments and most types of oblique; relativization
on phrase-internal constituents (such as possessors) is not generally possible. In addition
to primary nominalizations/relativizations, a wide variety of “secondary” nominalizers
57exist which form nominalizations/relativizations on concepts such as “time when pred”,
“manner of pred” and “partner in pred”. Secondary nominalizations/relativizations
participate in most, though not all, of the constructions available to primary
nominalizations/relativizations. Nominalized clause subjects are always in the Genitive.
In addition to basic nominalizing/relativizing functions, primary nominalizations
(not secondary nominalizations) may also occur in clausal nominalizations. In clausal
nominalizations, which may be final, backgrounding, or framing (=recapitulative, headtail linking), the nominalization is not relativized from any constituent, but instead stands
alone in a main-clause-like structure and function, with an unmarked (Nominative)
subject, and with its predicate potentially inflected. Clausal nominalizations generally
convey a reified, fact-like information status value, and in some uses also interact with
“conjunct/disjunct” subject person-sensitive aspect-marking.
1.2.10.1.6. Relational and referential marking
Subject (S/A alignment) is a clearly identifiable grammatical relation. Object (O,
or O/E alignment) is a potentially supported grammatical relation, but is not as welldefined. Main clause subjects are unmarked (Nominative); dependent clause subjects are
usually Genitive (see §1.2.10.1.5). O arguments of both main and dependent clauses are
marked Accusative if definite, referential, and low in animacy. High animates, including
proper names and other definite NPs referring to known humans, are marked Non-agentive
when in O function. A wide variety of noun phrase types take Dative or Locative marking;
Dative/Locative marked noun phrases sometimes have core (E) argument status, and
other times seemingly have non-core oblique (non-core) status. The core or oblique status
of a noun phrase is most effectively tested via accessibility to non-subject core versus
oblique nominalization/relativization. Genitive, Accusative, Dative and Locative marking
is primarily accomplished via a set of simplex, monosyllabic phrasal
postpositions/enclitics. Additional oblique noun phrases realizing a wide variety of
semantic roles are marked via disyllabic, usually complex and/or fused postpositions
which are likely to have occurred at one time as sequences of case markers/postpositions
(for example, Ablative/Partitive lokə̀ from *lo ‘LOC’ + *kə̀ ‘GEN’). Common noun phrases
are marked for referential status by articles, including an individuator and topic marker
(roughly but not completely corresponding to indefinite and definite NP-marking
functions), as well as by demonstratives and by zero.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

1.1. Overview
The following work is a descriptive grammar of the Lare dialect of Galo, 1 a
language of the Tani branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family which is spoken in
central Arunachal Pradesh state, North-East India. It is the first ever attempt at a
comprehensive description of the grammar of Galo, or, for that matter, of any Tani
language. It is designed to serve three main purposes. First, it is designed to serve as a
partial historical record of the Galo language as it was spoken in the early 21st century.
For reasons that will be discussed, no extant document yet comes close to serving this
purpose. Second, it is designed to serve as a reference for linguists, anthropologists, and
other scholars engaged in comparative language typology, or with other interests in
languages and cultures of the region. Third, and perhaps most importantly, it is designed
to serve as a foundation from which further descriptive, documentary and pedagogical
materials may be developed to aid in the preservation and maintenance of the Galo
language, for the benefit of future generations of Galo people.
Although the primary focus in this work will fall consistently on the Lare dialect
of Galo, in light of the extreme paucity of documentary and descriptive materials for Tani
languages in general, references will be made to certain other Galo dialects and certain
other Tani languages where possible and relevant to the discussion; this is as much in aid
of situating Lare Galo in typological relation to its relatives and neighbours as it will be –
I hope – in aid of furthering broader linguistic studies in this extremely interesting and
very much neglected area of the linguistic world.
In this chapter, the following subsections provide a contextual overview of Galo
language and culture (§1.2), followed by a review of relevant works by other scholars
(§1.3), a discussion of the theoretical framework in terms of which this study is conducted
(§1.4) and a description of my fieldwork and analytical methodologies (§1.5). §1.6 and
§1.7 finally discuss conventions and the structure of this work in more detail.
1Except where relevant to address a particular point, I adopt the convention throughout this work of
referring to major tribal, language and dialect names in running text using the simplified romanizations
which are most likely to be encountered elsewhere in print, despite that these are often at odds with their
pronunciations in Lare Galo – the latter, for example, being pronounced larèe galòo by the Lare Galo
themselves. Most Galo proper names, clan names and village names are referred-to using the Lare Galo
pronunciation; where a particular village name may have a relatively well-known and dissimilar
romanization, this is given in parentheses, as daarɨ ̀ɨ (Daring) village of West Siang District. Where a nonLare pronunciation of a Galo word is referenced, the dialect is always identified; where a word is simply
identified as “Galo” (without mentioning a specific dialect), pronunciation may be assumed to be basically
the same across dialects, to the extent that I have been able to determine.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

This work is divided into seventeen major chapters, with 8 appendices. Following
this introductory chapter, §2 is a historical overview, and treats the evolution of Galo
morphology and (mainly) phonology from Proto-Tani, to Proto-Galo, to the present
dialects. §3 and §4 discuss aspects of modern Lare Galo synchronic phonology, from
segmental/syllabic and word/phrasal perspectives respectively. §5 turns to the Galo
lexicon, discussing the semantic and structural features of the major word classes. §6-§8
treat aspects of the noun phrase; §6 reviews noun phrase structure, and includes
description of noun phrase constituents and their behaviour, as well as phrasal functions
such as noun phrase coordination and apposition. §7 presents a more detailed overview of
pro-forms and (other) shifters, including personal, reflexive and interrogative pronouns,
and demonstratives. §8 reviews post-head nominal modifiers, including relator nouns,
numerals, classifiers and qualifying nouns.
§9 turns to the clause, and discusses clause types and their internal structure. §10§12 treat aspects of the predicate complex; §10 discusses possible predicate structures,
and §11 and §12 discuss predicate derivations and inflections respectively. §13 discusses
particles at the phrasal and clausal level, and rounds off the discussion of basic clause
structure and clause constituents. §14 turns to grammatical, semantic and pragmatic
functions of the noun phrase, including relational and pragmatic marking and marking
variations, and also reviews the evidence for grammaticalization of high-level syntactic
functions such as “subject” and “object” in Galo. §15 and §16 each discuss complex
constructions; while §15 focuses on nominalization-based constructions, including
nominalized/relative clauses and clausal nominalizations, §16 turns to multi-clause
constructions which are not based on synchronic nominalizations, including complex
predicates and clause chains, adverbial subordination and complementation. §17 is a
postscript regarding the future of the Galo language.
Appendix A contains a list of approximately 1,400 Galo roots, together with a set
of approximately 4,000 contexts (lexemes and other morphemes) in which they are
instantiated in modern Lare Galo, as well as Proto-Tani reconstructions (where available).
Appendix B contains a posited set of regular Proto-Tibeto-Burman – Proto-Tani – ProtoGalo – Lare and Pugo Galo segmental correspondences, centred around the Proto-Tani
reconstruction of Sun (1993b). Appendix C contains a change table proving the set of
rules posited in §2.4 to have occurred between Proto-Tani and modern Lare Galo, using a
sample set of 43 illustrative lexemes. Appendices D-G present a description of the text
80database used in this study, together with a sample set of 3 analyzed texts. Appendix H is
a bibliography of works cited herein.","[79, 80, 81]"

Very commonly, an irrealis/prospective clausal subordination is marked in ə́m-làa
‘say-NF’, in a weakly grammaticalized linking function of non-final ə́m- ‘say’ which
supports discrete establishment of a subordination relationship. For further discussion and
examples, see §16.7.

Subordinate clauses in -dùu ‘IPFV’, -dó(o) ‘STAT’, or, most often, -dàk ‘COS’,
which are subsequently marked in “Imperfective disjunct” suffix -ée ‘IPFV.DISJ’
(described more generally in §12.5.2) exhibit a “different subject” subordinate/main
485Hclause coreferentiality constraint. (1137) first demonstrates a clausal subordination
486Hin -dó(o), in which the lower clause subject is overt and the higher clause subject is829ellipsed; although it is not a grammatical requirement, the interpretation is
overwhelmingly likely to be conjunct (same-subject).317

The Isolative suffix -ráa ‘ISOL’ has the basic sense ‘as odd one out; not doing what others are doing’ and
in this clause contributes a sense of ‘do on someone’s behalf (what they are not doing themselves)’. It is
added to render the expression more semantically felicitous, but does not affect the argument structure.

16.5.4.4. Quasi-S complement of rɨ-̀ ‘do’
In a use seemingly limited to occurrence with two particular senses of S=A
ambitransitive verb rɨ ̀- ‘do’ – but with very high overall text-frequency and functional
value – a clausal subordination in bə́ occurs as a “quasi-complement” of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in S or E
function. The relevant senses of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ in this case are ‘happen; be the case’ (as in əmbə̀rɨ ̀-káa ‘ANAP.PADV do-PF’ ‘it happened like that’) and ‘do (in the British sense); be all
right/passable; be required’ (as in agóm=əə rɨ ̀-dùu ‘speech=TOP do-IPFV’ ‘the sentence is
(grammatically) correct/passable’). Clausal subordination in bə́ to rɨ ̀- ‘do’ is a “quasicomplement” in the sense that it is difficult to show that the subordinated clause is filling
a verb-subcategorized complement slot per se, and is not simply occurring as a nonsubcategorized adjunct. For example, in (1142), it is conceivable that ‘deer’ is in fact the
485Hsyntactic subject of ‘do’, with the clausal subordination occurring as an adjunct. Similarly,
in (1143) it is conceivable that the S of ‘do’ is something like a second person pronoun, or
4856Helse a noun ‘person’.","[828, 829, 830, 831]"

The following subsections discuss phonological changes from Proto-Tani to
Proto-Galo. In them, changes are described as “ordered” or “unordered”. “Ordered”, in
this sense, indicates changes for which either language-internal or cross-language
evidence for ordering exists. “Unordered” indicates changes for which no particular
ordering must be posited on language-internal grounds, and for which cross-language
evidence for ordering has not yet been adduced. It is of course possible and likely that
additional comparative Tani research will motivate an ordering which is different from
the more or less arbitrary order of presentation in which “unordered” changes are shown
here.
Following the title of each section, a numeral appears in (parentheses) which
refers to the numeral assigned to each change in the change table of Appendix C.
2.4.3.1. PPG Stage A: Prefixation and Root-nuclear harmonization (1)-(3)
It was argued in §2.1.3 that prefixation of lexical roots was probably productive at
the Proto-Tani stage. Interestingly, however, we find differences among prefixes as to
whether or not they were subjected to vowel shifts and/or Root-nuclear vowel
harmonization.
Among the most common Proto-Tani prefixes, Masculine and Feminine
diminutive prefixes *ta- and *ja- only very rarely exhibit nuclear vowel variation and/or
harmony with the root nucleus (cf. §5.3.1.1). *ɕa- ‘Higher animal prefix’ always has the
Lare reflex ho- (§5.3.1.1.5); PT short *a → Galo o is irregular in Lare, but is found
commonly (and possibly regularly in at least some environments) in northern dialects
such as Karko; it is possible that the modern Lare reflex is irregularly associated with this
process (cf. §5.3.1.1.5).
PTp *pV- ‘Bird/flying prefix’ (§5.3.1.1.4) tends strongly to exhibit irregular rootnuclear vowel harmony, as pokòk ‘blackbrowed tree pie (Dendrocitta frontalis)’ and pɨtɨ ́r
‘chicken coop’. When not nucleus-harmonized, it usually (certainly not always) has the
reflex pə-, as in pəbée ‘parrot (generic)’ and pətáa ‘bird (generic)’. PTs *a-, the most
frequent and important prefix by far (§5.3.1.1.1), very often exhibits root-nuclear vowel
harmony, as in ɨrɨ ́ɨ ‘ten’ (< PTs *a-rjiŋ ‘ten’) and opòo ‘liquor’ (< PTs *a-poŋ ‘liquor’).
102Although it is not a watertight criterion, the tendency is for formations which retain a
certain amount of synchronic activity/productivity to retain the proto-vocalism [a]; for
example, the citation forms of most Galo classifiers, all of which are prefixed in a- (with
an Individuating function), usually resist harmonization, as adáa ‘CLF:STICK’ and ahú
‘CLF:FOURS’ (§8.2.2).
Intuitively, then, it seems likely that relatively older formations, and/or those
which underwent lexicalization at an earlier stage, exhibit modern harmonized reflexes.
Relatively younger formations, and/or those which retained or may continue to retain
productivity, resisted harmonization. However, we must also accept the possibility that a
more predictive – but currently unknown – conditioning factor may eventually be found.
Among compounds, extremely little vowel harmonization has occurred in the
history of Galo, although occasional exceptions such as mɨkə̀ ‘smoke’ (< PTs *mə ‘fire’ +
*kɨ ‘smoke’) are found (§2.3.1). 39
Schematically, then, we can represent “Stage 1” as the initial prefixation and/or
lexicalization of those prefixed forms which eventually vowel-harmonized (i.e., it is a
morphological rather than phonological “stage” as such). “Stage 2” then describes the
eventual harmonization of prefixal vowels with the root nuclear vowel. “Stage 3” then
again describes the prefixation of roots and/or lexicalization of prefixed roots which did
not undergo vowel harmony. Ultimately, though, this is simply a shorthand for what
seems very likely to have been a sporadic and/or cyclical process, which applied at
several points in time and affected different areas of the lexicon differently.
Finally, we can note that root-nuclear harmonization has been noted by Donegan
and Stampe to be associated in various languages by the development of a trochaic
(falling) metrical foot (see Donegan and Stampe (1983; 2004), with particular reference to
the Mundan branch of Austro-Asiatic). Although we are not yet in a position to
reconstruct Tani historical prosody, it seems very plausible indeed that what is being
viewed here in diagnostic terms as a matter of prefixal lexicalization may in fact be better
represented as the rise of a trochaic metrical foot. Future research will most certainly
address this question.","[100, 101, 102, 103]"

word tone is a direct projection of that single TBU. Among nouns and adjectives, this
applies to most types of prefixed roots, such as those in a- ‘PFX’, ta- ‘MDIM’, ja- ‘FDIM’
and ho- ‘PFX:ANIMAL’; none of these prefixes are underlying TBUs. Among verbs, this
mainly applies to citation forms, since Realis event nominalizer -nam (quite helpfully!) is
not an underlying TBU. Table 4.9 presents a selection of disyllabic words consisting of
prefixed and suffixed roots, in which the resulting word tone is a direct projection of the
single tone-bearing morpheme.

Low/Tense words hɨɨnám ‘to urinate’ and hɨɨnàm ‘to plug/clamp’ (waveforms are
henceforth omitted in the interest of space). Note that the pitch contours of disyllabic
words are somewhat more detailed than are those of monosyllabic words. Specifically, in
the High/Plain word hɨɨnám ‘to urinate’ (Figure 4.9), there is a slight initial rise to a level
“plateau”, followed by a slight downstep or downdrift at the right edge (roughly, 34 43).
182The Low/Tense contour of hɨɨnàm ‘to plug/clamp’ (Figure 4.10) is more marked,
exhibiting an overall rising-falling form (roughly, 35 41. This rising-falling form is
particularly evident in relatively larger disyllabic Low/Tense phonological words (i.e.,
those with relatively heavier internal syllable structures). The important thing to bear in
mind here, however, is that despite perceptible phonetic differences between the pitch
contours of relatively smaller and relatively larger phonological words, the tonal
specification of the word as High/Plain or Low/Tense remains the same (also see
discussion in §4.2.2.3).

underlying TBU. When both constituents of a disyllabic word are underlying TBUs, the
183word tone contour must now be analysed as a product of their interaction. The general
principle followed at the word level is low trumps high; Table 4.10 illustrates the full set
of possible patterns for nouns/adjectives (first four) and verbs (second four); the same
basic derivation holds for lexeme-internal/lexicalized compositions and
actively/productively-formed compounds or root-suffix constructions alike.

the final syllables of the Low/Tense words illustrated in Figure 4.12-Figure 4.14 all drop

This section provides a very brief overview of some salient linguistic features of
Galo language; it is divided into two subsections: a grammatical sketch, which represents
an overall synopsis of this work, followed by an overview of some notable linguistic
features, basically comprising features which appear to be typologically unusual, of
potential theoretical interest, or which otherwise have seemed to me to be for various
reasons remarkable and/or especially worthy of general attention.
1.2.10.1. Grammatical sketch
1.2.10.1.1. Phonology
Galo has seventeen consonants and seven vowels. Consonants include bilabial,
alveolar, palatal and velar voiced and voiceless unaspirated stops and nasals (palatal stops
are affricated), lateral and rhotic liquids and alveolar and glottal fricatives. Vowels
include three high, three mid and one low. Galo exhibits a “root-to-word” tone system, in
which two tones (high/plain and low/tense) are lexically-assigned at the level of the
(usually bound and monosyllabic) morpheme/root, and realized on the surface as a
derived property of the (usually complex and polysyllabic) phonological word. Stress is
trochaic/initial/falling, feet are minimally bimoraic; words are minimally one foot.
1.2.10.1.2. Morphology
Galo is basically synthetic and agglutinating, although noun phrases and
predicates differ greatly in the number and status of dependents. Nouns exhibit a
maximum of one usually non-productive or semi-productive prefix, as ho-dúm
‘PFX:HIGH.ANIMAL-barking deer’ ‘barking deer’, but do not generally host suffixes.
Predicates host no prefixes, but may exhibit as many as five or six suffixes, in addition to
three or four additional particles/enclitics which fall outside the grammatical predicate
word, as in mò-ŋám-zí-kò-tó-kú=kée! ‘make-EXH-BEN-RVS-CMPL-IPTV.ODIR=HORT.POL’
‘please let him finish making it for you!’
Roots must be grammatically distinguished from words; roots are in general
bound, and usually require either to be prefixed, suffixed, or compounded in order to
stand as a grammatical word. A few seemingly simplex, monosyllabic lexemes are found;
53in some cases, such forms may represent reductions or simplifications of earlier complex
forms (for example, ìi ‘blood’ may reflect PTs *a-vii → *a-ii → *i-ii → ii; see §2.4.3.1).
Or, such forms may in some if not all cases be genuine exceptions. Suffixes must be
grammatically distinguished from clitics in Galo; suffixes are word-level dependents, and
can license a grammatical word through attachment to a grammatically bound root; for
example: ín-nam ‘go-NZR:RLS’ ‘to go’, from ín- ‘go’. Clitics are usually phrase-level
dependents, and cannot license a grammatical word by attaching to a bound root. Most
noun phrase operators are clitics, as namə́=lo ‘house=LOC’; most predicate operators are
suffixes (as -nam ‘NZR:RLS’).","[51, 52, 53, 54]"
"For example, a term in -báa is straightforwardly adverbialized in bə́ – a prototypically adjectival trait –
but cannot always occur as Copula Complement – another prototypically adjectival trait; for further
discussion and examples, see §11.2.4.2.
1042405.2.3.2. “Inner core” adjectives: Monosyllabic adjectival roots
Inner core adjectives form a very small and probably closed class of four to seven
members, according to what may amount to subdialectal variation. They are unlike any
other nouns or adjectives in being unable to stand as grammatical words. Instead, they
occur as bound, monosyllabic roots which must be compounded to a classifier root (an
“Adjectival classifier expression”) in order to function as a word; in absence of the
classifier roots shown in (66), the sentence is ungrammatical. For further discussion of
2183HClassifier expressions, see §8.2.2.4. Table 5.20 illustrates the set of monosyllabic
2184H2185Hadjectival roots attested in my corpus.","[240, 241]"

generally allowed in the Galo predicate complex (§10.1).
327H11.1.6.2.5. Native speaker intuition
Finally, we can revisit the question of native speaker intuition. Although speakers
are often comfortable assigning a “standalone” sense to sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] (§11.1.6.2.1), they are less comfortable assigning standalone senses to
3278Hsequences of the form [PDER-x] such as ladù in (425)/(430)/(431). None of my consultants
3279H3280H3281Hhave so far been able to assign a sense to a phonological word of the form [PDER-PDER],
as in (420), reproduced here and bolded for convenience (433).

To briefly summarize this section, we have considered evidence from native speaker
intuitions concerning the capacity for sub-predicate “words” to stand alone, and be
assigned a “standalone” meaning, concerning the capacity for sub-predicate “words” to
clearly pattern as words in the syntax, whether as terms of syntactic constituents other
than the predicate complex or as terms of movement within the predicate complex, and
concerning the morphological status of sub-predicate word “heads”, in terms of whether it
is sensible or not to analyse them sometimes as heads of free syntactic words, and
sometimes not. Overall, I conclude that while it is certain that sequences of the form
[VROOT-PDER] have grammatical “word” status in many cases, it is not possible to
generalize this status over an entire syntactic category which such sequences could be
said to realize in every case. The evidence for grammatical “word” status of sequences of
the form [PDER-x] is even weaker. Ultimately, it would appear that the only type of posthead syntactic “word” that could be identified within the predicate complex would be one
whose head can be either a predicate derivation or a predicate inflection, which is
homophonous with and functionally identical to bound morphological dependents, and
whose only raison d’être would appear to be the fact of occurrence in third syllable
position in the predicate complex (which is, of course, a phonological rather than a
grammatical fact).
I therefore conclude that the only complete sense in which sub-predicate words in
Galo are “words” is a phonological sense; grammatically, there is no great motivation for
considering Galo predicate derivations as anything other than bound predicate formatives.
Precisely what kind of bound formative they may be is the topic of the next
section.
11.1.7. Morphological status of predicate derivations – roots, suffixes or both?
In the preceding section §11.1.6 we reviewed the phonological and grammatical
3284Hstatuses of sub-predicate “words” in Galo, concluding that while data clearly support the
analysis of sub-predicate words in a phonological sense, data do not generally support an
analysis of sub-predicate words in a grammatical sense. Having concluded that Galo
predicate derivations constitute a category of bound predicate formatives, it remains to
consider their morphological status; i.e., whether they are best analysed as roots, suffixes,
or (in some sense) both. The ultimate question is whether to adopt the analysis
schematized in (434), in which predicate derivations, or some subset thereof, are analysed
3285H476as lexical roots – in some sense equivalent to verb roots – or that of (435), in which
3286Hpredicate derivations, or some subset thereof, are analysed as suffixes.

All predicate formatives in Galo would appear to have the same potential syllable
structure, segmental composition, and capacity for tonal assignment. This means that
there is no way of determining on a purely morphological basis whether a given predicate
formative has lexical (root) or functor (suffix) status. In addition, since there appears to be
no grammatical limitation on the type of predicate base to which a predicate derivation
may be bound, and no clear procedure yet identified for assigning predicate derivations to
a structurally-determined set of position-classes, nor to categorically-determined head or
dependent positions within sub-predicate words (see §11.1.6.2), we are left with a very
3287Hthin set of structural criteria indeed with which to determine the morphological status of
bound formatives of the predicate.
However, one possibility not yet addressed in detail is that of predicate derivations
themselves standing as a predicate head. Surely, if it were possible for a predicate
derivation to stand as the lexical head of a predicate, this would be strong evidence in
favour of its analysis as a bound lexical root rather than a suffix. And, in fact, there are
clear indications that large numbers of predicate derivations have homophonous,
semantically-relatable “counterpart” verb roots. Consider examples (436) through (440),
328H3289Hin which the first sentence has a bold verb root which is homophonous with and
semantically relatable to the bold predicate derivation in the second sentence. Note that477these are surface transcriptions, which therefore bear some formal differences, but that
underlyingly, the bolded morphemes are fully homophonous.

Dozens more such examples may be found, and some of my more reflective consultants
are explicitly aware of the formal and semantic relatedness, not to say identity, of forms
like cèn- ‘know’ and -cèn ‘KNOWING MANNER’ in (439). Predicate derivations with even
3290Hmore detailed semantic values exist, and often have clear correspondences to
homophonous verb roots; for example, consider húk- ‘of a blade, to separate from the
handle to which it is bound as a knife, machete or sword’ and -húk ‘DE-HANDLE RESULT’,
as in tú-húk ‘kick (a knife, machete or sword), with the result that the blade separates
from the handle’.
Even more significant, perhaps, is evidence that speakers are able to alternate their
expression of certain information between verb root and predicate derivational
instantiations. For example, consider the passage in (441), in which Speaker A’s
3291Hrestatement of the predicate in his second sentence could be construed as a case in which
the predicate derivation -càa ‘ASCEND’ is moved to predicate head position; potentially,
such decision would relate to the fact that càa- ‘ascend’ is more semantically general than
478gacàa ‘scale to top’. càa- ‘ascend’ would then be more appropriately deployed in a
sentence in which the focal information is contained in the noun phrase and the predicate
semantics are de-emphasized or backgrounded, as seems to be the case here.

A: ‘Saying “Aya! Abo Tani has come to know my secret!” she climbed back up
via the shining path.’ B: ‘Uh-huh.’ A: ‘She went back up via the rays of the sun,
you see.’ (NyPB/MN, LAT 323-325)
It seems evident that a patterned relationship exists between the predicate derivation -càa
‘ASCEND’ of Speaker A’s first sentence and the verb root càa- ‘ascend’ of his second
sentence. On this basis, we might go as far as to suggest that càa- and -càa in fact reflect a
single underlying form, which takes on different properties when differently employed
within the predicate morphology, but which has a single underlying cognitive value.
And yet, important as these strong correspondences between predicate derivations
and other types of morpheme may be, they do not apply to all or even the majority of
Galo predicate derivations. In fact, of the 321 predicate derivations currently attested for
Galo (not counting the multiple senses or functions of several of them), only 76, or 23.7%,
have clear verb root cognates. A further 32, or 10%, are potentially cognate with bound
nominal or adjectival roots, although it is less clear in many such cases whether or not an
active synchronic relationship can be said to exist. In any case, this still leaves 213
predicate derivations – almost two thirds of the available data – for which neither I nor
two of my consultants who worked through the entire list of 321 attested predicate
derivations with me in detail have been able to associate with any other root occurring in
the language.
Neither does it appear to be the case that presence or absence of a cognate verb
root (or any other type of root) in the language correlates in any way with what we might
call the depth of grammaticalization of a predicate derivation. That is to say, it appears
neither to be the case that the more functor-like predicate derivations attested in Galo lack
479a cognate verb root, nor that the more semantically particular or idiosyncratic-seeming
predicate derivations have verb root cognates, even as an overall tendency. For example,
the Comitative applicative derivation -gə́ and the Causative applicative derivation -mò are
two of the most abstractly functional of all predicate derivations, having both developed
clause-continuity functionality in addition to clause valence-altering functions (discussed
in §11.2.5.4 and §11.2.5.3 respectively). And yet, they have two of the most clearly
329H329Hrelatable verb root sources we can find: gə́- ‘carry/wear’ and mò- ‘make’. On the other
hand, -mèn ‘PLAYFUL MANNER’ and -kə̀ ‘DEAD RESULT’ (§11.2.1.1) seem so semantically
3294Hparticular that they (intuitively, perhaps) must be expressible as lexical heads – and yet,
they aren’t. 211
210FFurthermore, as was also discussed in more general terms in §2.3, it is almost
3295Hnever safe to analyse a predicate derivation in terms of direct importation of the semantics
of a putatively cognate root, even when they appear clearly relatable. For example,
although the verb root kák- ‘wash surface’ has a clear semantic restriction against
selection of human/animate or clothing O argument referents (for which the separate verb
roots hú- ‘wash a body’ and rɨ ́k- ‘wash clothes’ respectively exist), this restriction does
not apply to the Result derivation -kàk ‘CLEAN’, as shown in (435). Similarly, the
3296HBenefactive Applicative derivation -zí ‘BEN’ clearly relates to the verb root zí- ‘give’, and
a few of my consultants have drawn explicit links between these forms. And yet their
properties with respect to the organization of argument structure in a clause are quite
different. For details, see §11.2.5.2.
3297HFinally, although it is generally the case that predicate derivations are
homophonous with apparently cognate roots, it is not always. For example, PTs *len
‘exit’ has a regular Galo reflex in the Directional predicate derivation -lèn ‘OUT’; however,
its verb root counterpart exhibits a rare, irregular l- → n- / #_ change in nèn- ‘exit’. Such
211The apparent non-correspondence between persistence or decline of the lexical source form of a functor
in Galo and its depth or extent of grammaticalization is a perhaps surprising discovery given the plethora of
correlations between these facts which have been identified in the literature on grammaticalization in
Mainland South-East Asian languages. For example, obsolescence of the lexical source of a putatively
functional serialized verb is routinely employed as an argument in favour of its advanced reanalysis and
structural adjustment (Li and Thompson 1981). Post (2007) even went so far as to suggest that lexeme
obsolescence could have an implicitly causal relation to advanced structural adjustment of functor
morphemes in Chinese. Although the typologies of these languages largely differ with that of Galo – in
particular, the morphemes in question are usually syntactic words in Mainland South-East Asian languages,
whereas in Galo they are bound formatives, and presumably must be assumed to have different cognitive
statuses – the facts we have reviewed here at least suggest that the place of lexeme obsolescence in
grammaticalization theory may require some reconsideration; indeed, it may be of no relevance whatsoever.","[474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480]"
"1032.4.3.2. PPG Stage B: Segment losses and syllable erosion
Most of the phonological changes which took place in Stage B (changes 4-8)
involve losses and mergers of segments and consequent erosion and simplification of the
Proto-Tani syllable canon. They seem mainly to have affected Eastern Tani languages
such as Mising and Minyong, but not Western Tani languages like Apatani, Nyishi and
Bokar. Their prevalence in Galo would thus suggest an early Eastern Tani areal (if not
genetic) affinity.
2.4.3.2.1. Non-palatal fricative deletion (4)
In this well-attested unordered change, the PTs non-palatal fricatives *f, *v, *h
and *ɦ were lost. No evidence of secondary effects of the deletions has been found.
Informally: [+frx, -pal] → Ø.
In Table 2.7, and in all the ensuing illustrative tables, note that the “PTs” column
indicates the Proto-Tani form reconstructed by Sun (1993b). “PPG” indicates a pre-ProtoGalo form, in effect the PTs form post-change. “PG” indicates the Proto-Galo form, and
includes any prefixes and/or compound environments known to have lexicalized by that
stage; it is of course possible the same forms were prefixed or compounded at an earlier
stage, but at the current stage of knowledge very little can be proposed with confidence.
“Lare” indicates the modern Lare Galo form. In the Gloss column, “*” indicates that the
marked lexical iterm did not undergo the change, and is being provided for comparison
only.

In this ordered change, medial *-j-, if it existed, was deleted following *g- only.
Initial cluster *gj- is in fact poorly-attested in Tani, and is supported mainly by Apatanigrju sequences corresponding to gu sequences in other languages where, if the PT form in
fact contained an *-r- medial, the expected Bengni and Nyisu forms should contain a
medial *-j- reflex (but do not) (Sun 1999b:137). However, it is also possible that sporadic
palatalization in the environment of high vowels is exhibited in Apatani. In any case, if
the initial cluster *gj- existed, this change is required in order to remove these clusters

Regressive palatalization was a very important ordered change affecting a large
number of roots, which played out differently in different Tani languages and led to
salient phonological contrasts among them. The Tani language which we find to have
undergone Regressive palatalization changes which most closely resemble those reflected
in Galo is Bengni, a language of the Western branch (Sun 1993b). Hence, we may find
here evidence of a shift in areal affinity of a pre-Galo ancestral language.
In Regressive palatalization as it is reflected in modern Galo, we find that all
bilabials and velars became palatals before *-i, *-e, and *-j-, except bilabial stops before
*-e, which were unchanged. In addition, clusters consisting of bilabial and velar initials
and palatal medials became palatals before *-i and *-e, with the medial glide deleted.
Coronals were unaffected. Schematically, {+lab, +vel} → [+pal] / _ [+pal] (except b, p /
_e, and where e is marked as [+pal]). Since *gj- clusters (if they existed) were simplified
prior to this change (§2.4.3.2.5), they were not affected (Table 2.12).","[103, 104, 105, 106]"

preserved. Importantly, however, no syntactic reconfiguration is required in order for this

Translative sense (S/A become E); in (870), the (ellipsed) notional subject referent is an
4250Harea of land which has been cleared for cultivation. In absence of one or both of the
appositive phrases marked E, the sentence is borderline ungrammatical, and gives a sense
that the area is somehow being construed as an animate actor of ‘do’ (in the intransitive
sense) (871).

Translative E complements of rɨ ̀- ‘do’ may be replaced by adverbial pronounssuch as әmbә̀ ‘like that’, but are again not accusative-marked and cannot be referenced by696subject or object nominalizations, and so on. Thus, they do not qualify as S, A or O
arguments, despite being obligatorily present under this sense of the predicate.
Finally, we can note cases in which certain applicative derivations to a predicate
stem add an argument to a clause which, although semantically and syntactically
obligatory, is not treated as grammatical subject or object. The most frequently and
robustly-attested such case is that of directional applicatives such as -lɨ ̀k ‘INTO’. In (872),
425Hthe noun phrase marked E is licensed as a goal by the applicative derivation, and would
be understood as semantically entailed whether it overtly represented in the clause or not.

As far as I am aware, all arguments added to the clause via an applicativederivation may be referenced via Non-subject nominalization of the applicative-derived
predicate in -nam. For further discussion of applicative derivations, see §11.2.5.

This chapter discusses predicate inflections. §12.1 is an overview, and discusses
3675Hinflectional subclasses, obligatoriness, order and co-occurrence possibilities and
restrictions. Subsequent sections discuss the major functional classes of predicate
inflections in this order: negation (§12.2), aspect (§12.3) (comprising two subsections on
367H367Hprimary (§12.3.2) and secondary (§12.3.3) aspectual subtypes) and modality (§12.4). In

While the overlap is perhaps not complete, there is a very strong tendency in Galo
for a phonological word to consist of a single metrical foot, and for a metrical foot to
constitute a single phonological word (cf. §4.2.3.2). This generalization tends to hold
quite independently of the grammatical status of the elements in question. Thus in (21),
seven phonological words are realized, each consisting of a single metrical foot with the
initial syllable always stressed (marked `_). However, nammə́ and zaalâa are not
themselves grammatical words, but are rather portions of grammatical words, as
expressed in the interlinearization.","[156, 157]"

‘But me on the other hand, being a father, don’t kill me.’ (TB, OAM 298)12.4.2.3. Concessive imperative -gée
Concessive imperative -gée has the basic sense go ahead and (PRED). It is
generally used in cases when the speaker knows or believes that the addressee (occurring
obligatorily as a second person subject) wishes to perform the action denoted by the
predicate, or anticipates that the addressee may believe there to be some obstacle to
performing an action, and is reassuring him or her that in fact there is not (677)-(678). In
3841H3842H(678), note that -gée is subject to the irregular process of Initial gemination (§4.1.5.1).

The etymology of Concessive imperative -gée is unknown, but it may relatehistorically to Disjunct perfective -gée, described in §12.5.
3845H12.4.2.4. Motion modal -tà(a)
Motion modal -tà(a) ‘MOT’ usually forms a second person imperative with the
sense that the addressee must physically move from his or her current location in order to
perform the commanded event (679)-(680). Note in (680) that this does not entail
3846H3847H384H601movement away from the speech situation itself; rather, movement is simply from the
precise location where the addressee happens to be.

‘Mother, come on and sit here (moving from the place at which you currently

-tà(a) ‘MOT’ appears to be unique among imperative-forming inflections in alsooccurring with a first person subject, in non-imperative clauses only. In (681)-(682), the
3849H3850Hclause modality is controlled by the Proposal (§12.4.2.7) and Intentional (§12.4.2.8)
3851H3852Hinflections respectively, while the Motion modal simply indicates that the
proposed/intended activities involve movement on the part of the (first person) subject. In
(682), note also that -tà(a) ‘MOT’ is subject to irregular Initial gemination (§4.1.5.1).

‘Away’ imperative in -ée is attested as a suffix to motion predicates only. It entails
a proposal that the actor of the proposed motion event should go away from the place of
speaking in order to perform it (683).

Unlike most other imperative types, ‘Away’ imperative -ée seems to require a
following hortative particle of some kind. 238 In addition to second-person imperatives, -ée
237F‘IPTV.AWAY’ may also form a first person non-singular inclusive hortative in zù (684).

‘Let’s go (away from where we are and) take a look over there.’ (IR, FA 015)There are some indications that ‘Away’ imperative -ée may be cognate with the
‘Disjunct imperfective’ suffix -ée discussed in §12.5.2.
3857H12.4.2.6. Permissive -hòo
Permissive -hòo occurs with first person subjects only, and entails a request for
permission from the addressee to allow the speaker to perform the predicated action. In238It is not yet certain whether or not this is an absolute grammatical requirement; it may be, for example,
that in high-context situations, a hortative particle could be left off if the overall mood were understood (as
with the general imperative in -tó; see §12.4.2.1). However, consultants have not accepted such utterancesin elicitation, and due to the relative infrequency of ‘Away’ imperative -ée, no qualifying contexts have yet
been discovered in texts.","[600, 601, 602, 603]"

The present chapter discusses pro-forms, including pronouns, pro-adverbials, and
demonstratives. Many pro-forms have the ability to both stand alone as head of a noun
phase and to modify another noun phrase head. Others have the ability to stand as noun
phrase head only, lacking modifier capacity, and a few others – generally, when serving
in extended rather than basic functions – have the ability to stand as modifiers only,
lacking the ability to stand as a phrasal head. These properties will be discussed in
passing throughout the chapter.
All of the forms to be discussed herein have a common functional status in
forming a definitely referring expression in terms of, or in relation to, a shifting deictic
centre (usually, but not always, relatable to the speech situation). Many of the forms
discussed below also share common structural properties; in most cases, they may be
described in terms of relatively smaller sets of etymologically simplex (monosyllabic)
formatives which have combined historically with etymological postpositions and/or
suffixes to form synchronically non-compositional, usually disyllabic, forms; etymology
and compositionality will also be treated below, where possible. Many of the
demonstratives discussed below – usually, those which incorporate historical
postpositions – play a key role in noun phrase relational marking. Such functions will be
mentioned in passing below, but are treated more substantially in a language-general
context in §14.
253HThe remainder of the chapter discusses Personal (§7.1) and Reflexive (§7.2)
254H25Hpronouns, followed by Interrogative and Indefinite nouns and pronouns, which make use
of the same basic set of forms (§7.3). This is followed by a large section on various types
256Hof Demonstrative (§7.4), and finally Pro-adverbials are discussed in §7.5.
257H258H7.1. Personal pronouns
Lare Galo personal pronouns encode the person and number of an animate
referent. Persons are first (speaker), second (addressee) or third (person other than
speaker or addressee, whether male or female). Formally unmarked pronouns encode
singular number reference. Marked pronouns encode dual (two) or plural (more than two)
number reference (Table 7.1).

2531H253H7.2, we see that the principle difference is the irregular mutation of /b/ → /m/ in the third
person set found in Pugo (with attendant progressive nasal harmonization of the plural
formative in the third person plural form). In fact, it is also quite common to hear the third
person in mɨ ̀ɨ uttered by Lare speakers as well, even in the context of otherwise resolutely
Lare speech; consider example (151) – spoken by a lifelong resident of daarɨ ̀ɨ village, in
253Hthe heartland of the Lare area – in which the conservative and highly characteristic Lare
form of the Additive particle cìn (PG *cìn; cf. Pugo sìn) is juxtaposed against the
innovative third person singular pronoun form in mɨ ̀ɨ. This is a typical example, which
suggests the susceptibility of the pronoun set to change irregularly through areal diffusion
– not only in Galo, but, probably, in other Tani languages as well. In this grammar, the
third singular pronoun has been consistently identified as bɨ ̀ɨ, reflecting the conservative
Lare pronunciation, although mɨ ̀ɨ pronunciations are preserved in the surface transcription
line where attested. For further discussion, see §7.1.3.

‘(In order) that everybody might see what her father gave (her).’ (MK, TT 157)
First and second person singular pronouns ŋó and nó are among the very few
words in Galo with an underlyingly monomoraic structure. This fact is particularly
striking in view of their seeming history as bimoraic forms (see §7.1.3), as well as their
253Hparadigmatic opposition to a clearly bimoraic form in third person singular bɨ ̀ɨ. In
prosodic contexts which demand a bimoraic phonological word structure, ŋó and nó
exhibit regular rhyme lengthening (§4.1.3.5). Under C(V)-suffixation, ŋó and nó are
2536Hopposed to bɨ ̀ɨ in regularly recruiting the suffix-initial consonant to satisfy bimoraicity
requirements in a stressed prosodic context – thus confirming their status as underlyingly
monomoraic forms (§4.1.4.6). These facts are summarized in Table 7.3.

behaviour in different prosodic environments7.1.1. Animacy
Lare Galo personal pronouns prototypically refer to humans; however, they may
also refer to higher animals even in non-personified contexts. In such cases, the referredto animal will usually be under construal as relatively highly animate, as when a specific
individual features prominently in a narrative; example (152) is taken from a text
2539Hconcerning the hunting of a particular deer.","[318, 319, 320, 321, 322]"

Figure 14.2 – Schematization of the derivation from lexical entry to clausal projection, and its
interpretationTo be quite clear, I am claiming that in Galo, as (seemingly) opposed to a number
of nearby languages – particularly of Tibeto-Burman stock – direct marking of core
argument semantic roles vis a vis the predicate does not occur. 264 Instead, we must posit
263Flevels of structure both within the lexicon and within the clause syntax to account for the
behaviour of Galo noun phrases and their interpretation. This fact suggests to me, at least,
that Galo has undergone grammaticalization of, possibly, particular pragmaticorganizational processes (such as interclausal argument co-reference constraining
strategies) which other related languages of the area may not have, possibly as part of an
overall shift in its basic typology. In-depth exploration of this topic lies well outside the
scope of this work; however, I would suggest that much might be learned from a future
study of this nature.","[684, 685]"
"154described as a “word” than is would). Nonetheless, native speaker awareness of meaning
and independence may be employed as a supporting criterion.
Stated simply then, a grammatical word is identifiable in being treated as a unit
by the grammar at various levels. Characteristics of phonological words will be shortly
discussed; first, it will be useful to review some of the properties of affixes and clitics.
4.1.2. Affix and clitic
If “words” are, in general, both phonologically and grammatically independent,
both affixes and clitics are relatively dependent in both phonological and grammatical
senses. In a grammatical sense, words tend to head grammatical phrases while affixes and
clitics tend not to. In a phonological sense, words tend to head a phonological phrase,
hosting a primary-stressed syllable, while clitics and affixes tend not to (§4.1.4.1). In
addition, while words tend to exhibit a glottal stop onset prosody in Galo, clitics and
affixes tend not to (§4.1.3.3).
The affix/clitic distinction, however, is not phonological, but rather grammatical. 74
While clitics have the syntactic status of grammatical words, may phonologically depend
on a wide variety of constituent types, and usually have phrasal rather than local scope,
affixes do not have grammatical word status, but are rather word-level dependents –
usually, of a single type of grammatical word – and have word-level rather than phrasal
scope.
In Galo, some morpheme types may have affixal and clitic allomorphs, usually
with different segmental values. For example, the Galo Genitive and Accusative case
markers have suffixal and enclitic forms, with the suffixal forms operating on
pronominals and the enclitic forms operating on non-pronominally-headed noun phrases.
In the [bracketed] common noun-headed noun phrases in (19), we find that Accusativeəəm always occurs phrase-finally, prosodically depending on whatever noun phrase
constituent immediately precedes it (whether the head or a post-head functor). Note in
particular the occurrence of Accusative əəm after the Adverbial particle rûu ‘CERT’. Now
compare the [bracketed] pronominally-headed noun phrase in (20). Here, we see that the74In Galo at least, as in (I believe) most Tibeto-Burman languages; different characterizations of the
affix/clitic distinction may of course be viewed as more appropriate for other languages. For a fuller
discussion in the context of a cross-linguistic typology, see Aikhenvald (2002:43-57).","[154, 155]"
"Referentiality and pragmatic marking14.2.1. Canonical patterns
There are four basic possibilities for marking of the referential status of noun
phrases in Galo; all are mutually exclusive:
a) zero Ø (references type)b) individuator go (references individual as an instance of a type)c) Topic marker əə (references individual as contrastive with other
individuals)

By zero-marking, I mean here presentation of a noun phrase which is unmarked
for referential status. There are somewhat different implications for zero-marking of noun697phrases in different syntactic functions, with different phrasal heads, and in different
syntactic constructions/clause types.
Uniquely referential noun phrases (i.e., those headed by pronouns and proper
names) are almost always zero-marked in Galo when in subject function (effectively, in
Nominative case; see §6.1.2.2.8), although certain pronoun types may also be marked for
425Htopicality (§14.2.1.3; see also §6.1.3). Proper name-headed noun subject noun phrases are
425H4256Hobligatorily zero-marked for referentiality and/or are supported by a following
coreferential pronoun (873). Noun phrases definitely referring to known and/or highly
4257Hdiscourse topical individuals (such as ‘my father’) may be zero-marked, but may also be
marked for topicality when in subject function (§14.2.1.3).

Common nominal-headed subject noun phrases are zero-marked when nonreferential (and/or referring to a generic concept rather than a concrete individual) (874).
4259HZero-marking is particularly common of the subject of a non-specific existential
predication (875).

Temporal phrases headed by shifting/deictically-referring time nominals are zero-marked when establishing a realis (past-time) temporal context (§5.2.2.16.5).
4261HFinally, predicate-adjacent/incorporated, non-referential noun phrases are also
zero-marked. This phenomenon is discussed in detail in §14.2.2.2.
426H69814.2.1.2. Indefiniteness and individuation
Individuation of an entity is most often handled by noun phrase enclitic go.
Uniquely-referring expressions such as personal pronouns and proper names, inasmuch as
they refer a priori to well-individuated entities, are never marked for individuation ingo. 272
271FThe most common use of go is in marking common nominals in core argument
functions as ‘instances of a type’. As such, go often marks first mentions of discourse
referents (much like an indefinite article) (876).

Already-established referents whose type-construal is under focus (schematically,‘a [TYPE] one’ are also typically marked in go. In (877), the speaker has just been asked
426Hfor tamul go ‘betelnut(<Asm) IND’ ‘some betelnut’, and responds:

DECL=ETAG
‘One (which has already been) cut, right?’ (LN, OLB7:22)
Individuation in go may be of countable (876) or uncountable types of entity
4265H(878). Cases of seeming ambiguity may also emerge, depending on whether focus falls on
426Hthe individual or some mass from which it is drawn; for example, (877) could either be
4267Hunderstood as ‘an instance/exemplar (of betelnut) which has been cut’ or ‘some (portion
of the total mass of betelnut) which has been cut’. This is quite different from
indefinite/first mention reference to plural countables, which is differently marked in aTerms of address may be marked in a seeming reflex of go only in the context of a ‘Supplicative’
vocative expression, dicussed in §13.6.2; this is not, however, a synchronically individuating function.

Indefinite/interrogative pronouns of content jòo and quantity jadɨ ̀ are often markedin go when the existence of an individual is known, but some fact about it is not. Thus,
while pronoun of content jòo is best translated ‘what’ when used alone, and potentially
questions the nature of an abstract concept or type (as ‘what are you doing’), jòo=go
‘what=IND’ is best translated, with individual reference, as ‘which one’ or ‘what kind of
thing’. In (880), note also the use of Individuator go following the anaphorically-referring
4270HSemblative sense of demonstrative әkә̀. Use of go here is required in order to form a
properly-referring expression denoting ‘individual(s) of that kind’; without go, әkә̀ could
have conceptual reference only (i.e. ‘that sort of thing (without reference to an individual
exemplar)’). For further discussion of the properties of әkә̀, see §7.4.3.

Individuating properties such as those exhibited by go are generally the province
of classifiers – especially, generic classifiers – in Mainland South East Asian languages,
700and the highly-developed individuative functionality of go may at least in part explain the
usual lack of a generic classifier in Galo (§8.2.2.2.1). Individuation in go is also found in
427Hthe context of enumeration, in construction with numerals and, sometimes, classifiers
(881).

The individuative functionality of go is extended to denote a ‘unit’ sense on
temporal and episodic nominals, often with an adverb-like feel. On ordinal numbers, the
sense is of numbers of iterations of the event denoted by the predicate (882). On non427Hdeictic time nouns, the sense is of occurrence for one iteration of the denoted time
duration (883).

with a non-referential, adverb-like predicate-modifying sense, as aɲɲíi=go ‘bit=IND’ ‘a
little; a bit’ and azék=go ‘CLF:SLICE=IND’ ‘a smidgen; a dab’. Such forms also have nonmodifying uses as the deferential speech-qualifiers so common throughout Asian

The principal individuative functions of go are also handled by speaker- and
addressee-proximate Individuative demonstratives hɨgɨ ̀ and әgә̀, which apparently
represent fusions of go with simple Speaker- and Addressee-proximate simplex
demonstratives hì ‘SPRX’ and əə respectively. For additional discussion and examples, see
§7.4.4. A reflex of go may also be represented in speaker- and addressee-proximate
427HLocative/Temporal-episodic demonstratives hogò and ogò, although this is somewhat less
certain (see §7.4.5). Finally, there exists a possibility that go has given rise to the genitive
4278Henclitic gә, possibly via earlier functionality as a relator noun.
The etymology of go within Tibeto-Burman is currently unknown.","[697, 698, 699, 700, 701, 702]"
"705speaking, topic-marking of pronouns (when allowed) has a contrastive flavour, as ‘this
referent and no other’, and may occur when a speaker wishes to underscore the
uniqueness of a reference, as in (892), or when (re-)establishing a referent as a discourse
4286Htopic, as in (885) (where the second person dual pronoun re-establishes a set of two
4287Hparticipants as topic following a clause in which only one of them was mentioned as the
subject).

‘We wiped out lots of wild animals, we did.’ (NyR, MDS 067)In conditions of high topic-continuity, when same-subject resumptive pronouns alternate
only with coreferential zeros, topic-marking is almost never found.
Topic-marking of genitive pronouns is common, as ŋó-kə̀=əə ‘1.SG-GEN=TOP’;
however, this is structurally a type of headless noun phrase, hence is quite different from
the direct topic-marking of personal pronouns. Topic-marking of ablative demonstratives
is seemingly associated with a distinct function (discussed in §14.3.6.2); topic-marking of
428Hother demonstrative pronoun types does not occur.
In addition to marking clause-internal noun phrases, Topic marker әә very
frequently marks Backgrounding and Framing clausal nominalizations, which occur at
the clause periphery to provide information with reference to which, or in light of which,
the information contained in a clause is construed to occur (§15.3.2) (893). Other clause4289H4290Hmarking functions of the Topic marker include marking the presupposed (non-focal)
element of a cleft/focus construction, which obligatorily undergoes nominalization in
Galo (§9.4) (894).

Multiple non-object referents may bear topic marking in argument-internalappositive coordination, as in (891), as well as in double-topic constructions, discussed in
4293H§14.2.2.1. O arguments are never marked as topics, except to the extent that accusative429Hmarking in əəm can be related synchronically to topic-marking – a possible analysis
(discussed in §14.3.2.1) which is not, however, the analysis adopted in this work.
4295HTopic marker əə patterns as a phrasal enclitic. Following the rule of Triggered
foot-strengthening (§4.1.4.6), Topic marker əə fuses with preceding light-light ((C)V.CV)
4296Hphonological words, motivating compensatory medial gemination in the medial consonant
(cf. (893) above). Topic-marker əə is inaudible when cliticized to a phonological word of
4297HHeavy-Light syllable structure, whose final vowel is in -o or -ə (sometimes including -u).
For an illustrated summary of the phonetics and phonology of the Topic marker, see §4.3.
4298HEtymologically, Topic marker əə seems likely to derive from an anaphoric
demonstrative, which most probably also exhibits reflexes in Accusative case enclitic əəm
(§14.3.2.1), as well as in anaphorically-referring demonstratives such as Individuative əgə̀
429Hand Semblative/Genitive əkə̀ (§7.4.4, §7.4.3). However, that əə ‘TOP’ no longer occurs
430H4301Hwith full demonstrative functionality is demonstrated by its inability to “bracket” a noun
phrase; compare (895) with the unacceptable sentence in (896).

430HOther extended functions of Topic marker əə ‘TOP’ (or reflexes of an ancestral
form) include use as an imperfective copula (discussed in §9.3.2). Topic marker əə is by
4305Hfar the most frequently-attested morpheme in my corpus.
Topic-marking is also, although much less frequently, handled by proximate
demonstratives such as hì ‘PTOP’ and hɨgɨ ̀ ‘PTOP.IND’. Very generally speaking, they
function to mark a topic which a speaker wishes to place in some high immediate relief,
as one of particular importance to the current event-line. Proximate topic marking is
discussed in §7.4.2.3.
4306H14.2.1.4. Demonstratives
Simple demonstratives have the same basic definiteness-marking functionality as
Topic marker əə, but also exhibit additional deictic and other related referential properties.
Complex demonstratives combine these properties with additional functions such as
individuation and location. Demonstratives do not generally exhibit the nominalized
clause-marking functionality of Topic marker əə, however (or at least, not nearly to the
same extent).
The semantic and discourse-functional properties of demonstratives are discussed
in detail in §7.4.
4307H70814.2.2. Structural and functional extensions
The following subsections discuss structural and functional extensions to the
canonical patterns of Galo pragmatic marking discussed in §14.2.1.
4308H14.2.2.1. Double topic constructions
“Double topic constructions” are of two types. Type 1 employs a pre-core “topic”
slot (§9.2.1.5); in this type, the pre-core noun phrase is not an argument of the clause, but
4309Hinstead stands in some sort of implied relation to the clause or to its subject. In a Type 2
double topic construction, the second topic is itself an argument of the clause, and is
indistinguishable from the subject in terms of marking.

"2735.3.1.3.3. Negativity
A small number of nouns and adjectives include reflexes of the pan-Tani
‘Negative’ root PTs *maŋ ‘not (have)’, although again this does not in general reflect a
productive modern derivation (Table 5.39).

few Galo lexemes with generally emphatic values, such as maazí ‘very much’ and maazâa
‘very real/true’ (note here that the relative orders of the ‘Negative’ and ‘Intensifier’
morphemes are opposite). Although the correspondence is not certain, there are other
examples in Galo of forms with basically intensive or emphatic values apparently
deriving from negative forms; for example, see the set of ‘tag rejoinder’ particles
illustrated in §13.3.2.3.4.
280H5.3.1.4. Two-term compounds
Two-term compounds are usually quadrisyllabic constructions composed of two
disyllabic nouns or adjectives, with the overall prosodic status of a phonological phrase
(§4.1.4), and with the grammatical status of a single grammatical word (usually a noun).
281HAlthough many two-term compounds are not synchronically analyzable to speakers, the
patterns on which they are formed are in general productive in modern Galo.
Two-term compounds may be symmetrical (§5.3.1.4.1) or asymmetrical
28H(§5.3.1.4.2). Asymmetrical two-term compounds are further subdivided into common
283H(§5.3.1.4.2.1), root-pivotal (§5.3.1.4.2.2) and expressive (§5.3.1.4.2.3) subtypes.
284H285H286H2745.3.1.4.1. Symmetrical two-term compounds
Symmetrical two-term compounds (a.k.a. “coordinative compounds”) are
composed of two structurally and semantically parallel terms (usually nouns and
deverbal nominalizations, but sometimes also adjectives). In a symmetrical two-term
compound, each term denotes a prototypical exemplar, or a particularly salient or
inalienable feature of a natural class or type denoted by the whole. For example, inhodúm-horə́ ‘big game’, hodúm ‘barking deer’ and horə́ ‘boar’ are each among the most
commonly hunted ‘big game’ animals, and donám ‘eating’ and tɨɨnám ‘imbibing’ are the
most important aspects of a person’s donám-tɨɨnám ‘upkeep; sustenance’. Ordering
appears largely conventional, as opposed to semantically hierarchical; for example,
although anə̀ ‘mother’ certainly precedes ɲamə́ə ‘daughter-in-law’ in Galo social
hierarchy, and likewise precedes it in the compound anə̀-ɲamə́ə ‘mature women’ – the
reverse is the case for ací-abó ‘elder brother-father’ ‘mature men’ (Table 5.40).
