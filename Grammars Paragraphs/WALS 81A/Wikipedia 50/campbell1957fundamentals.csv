HOW TO USE A THAI DICTIONARY.
1. The use of a Thai Dictionary usually presents some difficulty at first because
of the fact previously mentioned that the vowels have no place in the alphabetical order of the consonants but form a separate series of their own.
The words are arranged firstly in order of consonants, then in order of vowels
and finally in order of tone marks.
A list of the consonants and vowels is given inside the front cover of
this book in the order in which they will be found in any standard dictionary
except that f| and €]""] come after 1, and f] and f]~| after fl.
2. To look up a word in a Thai dictionary proceed as follows.
2.1 Look up the first consonant of the word in its place in the alphabetical
order irrespective of whether or not it happens to be a silent consonant.
Do not take any notice of a vowel form which may precede the first consonant; that will be considered later.
■I

Look up under the letter H although in this case it is a silent consonant.

SUNG(FM) means “to order” both in the sense of “to order someone to
do something” and “to place an order”.
SEE-A (l?f fl) The basic meaning of SEE-A “to spoil” and it is used in a
variety of ways to indicate the general idea of spoiling, damaging or wasting.

Look up under H, then IH, then IHU, then IHU, and finally L14U014
2.5 The order of the tone marks, is, “No tone mark”, (—) (—) (—) and
(—) but there are no words where all the tone marks are used.
The arrangement of the words with reference to tone marks, which
it must be remembered is a tertiary arrangement after their arrangement
with reference to consonant order and vowel order is set out below with
specific examples.
— 403 —(i) $ 0 3 JORNG “to book”, “to reserve”.
(ii) Compound with $0-3 if any
(iii) $ 0 3 JORNG “shade”
!
(iv) Compounds with $ 0 3 if any
i>(v) $ 0 3 JORNG “to watch and wait”
vv(vi) Compounds with $ 0 3 such as $031$ “to look fixedly at”
(vii) $ 0 3 JORNG “lonely”

(viii) Compounds with $ 0 3 if any
(ix) Then on through the alphabetical order the next letter or vowel symbol

V
.
!
V
then $ 0 3 fl, etc. and then going onto $ 0 3 SU, $ 0 3 SU, $ 0 3 H, and
so on.
Although all these rules sound very complicated and confusing at first,
you will find that once you know the order of the consonants and vowels you
will soon pick up the procedure even if you have to search a little at the beginning.
3. The following hints may help you to find a word which at first sight may
not appear to be in the dictionary at all.
(a) The short “a”, the “o”, and the “or” sounds are often understood
and not written
tiuuTANON“road”MUPOP“meet”ufnNAKORN“city”(b) A number of words beginning with FIT "" and In £ are often spelled
with fl Si an
try the other.
(c) Some words starting with the “S” sound are spelled with 111 or
and a few words starting with the “J” sound are spelled $1.
— 404 —(d) The vowel (—) MYHUNAGAHT is often represented by 55
(e) A great many common words begin with the silent Ti .
If you forget about this and are not sure of the tone of the word
and look them up under their first sounded consonant you will
probably come to the conclusion that they are not in the dictionary
at all.
If you come across a word and can’t find it where you think it
ought to be the chances are that you will find it under H.

IDIOMATIC EXPRESSIONS.
We have given a number of the idiomatic usages of the words you
have learned in the various lessons but if you are going to progress with the
language you will have to know a great many more.
The expressions given below are all fairly common ones and have been
selected from the many hundreds that occur in ordinary conversation and
writing.
They are arranged in the order of the Thai dictionary and no transliteration is given as it is felt that anyone who gets as far as studying this appendix
will at least be able to read a simple Thai sentence.
Most idiomatic expressions can be used in a number of ways and an
exact translation is frequently impossible so it is well to be careful about using
them. When you meet them study the context in which they occurred, as an
idiom used out of context sounds strange to a native speaker of the language and
is not always understood.","[418, 419, 420, 421]"

There are a number of words in Thai which are usually translated as “Please”,
but which are mostly used in slightly different senses.
Certain other words which cannot readily be translated are also used when
it is desired to make an order or request sound a little more polite.

CONVERSATION.
20. A. 1. Double verbs.
Double verbs are very common in the Thai language and are used in
two different ways.
(a) Two verbs may be used together to denote two separate actions as in
English.
In this case each verb carries its own full meaning and the English translation
can generally be considered as having the word “and” understood between
the two verbs.
If there is an object it comes after the verbs in the normal manner.

PY_RUP JOTMAI JAHK
PRYSANEEGo and get the mail from
the post office.111fu DnHinuDinliliinim
MAH REE-AN NUNGSEU LEM N E E Come and studv this book.uiiiauviuiaomini
(b) A number of verbs in Thai can be used as adverbs to qualify or amplify
the meaning of the verbs.
In this case the two verbs are often called primary and secondary verbs, and
though this is a convenient nomenclature it is probably better in many cases to
think of the second verb as an adverb.
When two verbs are used in this manner, the object, if any, usually comes
between the primary and secondary or adverbial verb.
Some of the more common secondary verbs are set out below.
MAH “come” and PY “go”
These two words are frequently used as secondary verbs or adverbs
and you have had some examples of this usage already. They indicate that the
action specified by the primary verb takes place toward or away from the speaker
or sortie other designated or implied position.
For instance; if you ring up your soft drink suppliers you can say:
SONG SODAH KOO-AT YY_MAH
Send two dozen large soda
TEE BAHN POM SORNG LO
(come) to my house.","[255, 256]"

"26. A. 1. (b) Duplicated words.
Although as you have probably noticed it is very difficult to say exactly
what constitutes a single word in Thai, there are many cases where it is quite
■clear that two words are used together when it would appear that one of the
words alone would suffice.
— 346 —Once you realise the existence ot these double words they do not cause
you much trouble because in a great many cases they can be recognised bv the
fact that thev form an alliterative or euphonic combination.
An important thing to note is that the word order in these combinations is fixed and cannot be reversed.
These duplicated words fall broadly into two categories.
(i) Where both words have substantially the same meaning and either
at times may be used alone.","[361, 362]"

"In»HEN (Hill) means “to see with the eyes” and can also be used for “to think

used in the common English sense of “to meet”.
If you want to say “I saw him today” meaning “I met him today” you must
use POP “meet” and not HEN.

but not for “going to meet” someone, for which you must use another word
RUP (See Lesson 7. A.4.)
OW ( 101 ) means “to take” but it is not often used alone in this sense. It is
usually combined with MAH “to come” or PY “to go” to mean “bring” or
“take away”.
Double verbs of this nature are a common feature of the Thai language and
will be dealt with more fully in Lesson 20.
You should note however that where there is an object it is placed between
the two verbs. (Examples 3, 15.)
OW also means “want”. You will come across this meaning later.

13. A. 1. (a). The Continuous Tense.
The continuous tense in Thai is represented by putting the word
GUMLUNG “vigour” in front of the verb and the word YOO “to be located
at” after the verb and after the object if there is one.
Sometimes GUMLUNG is used alone and sometimes YOO is used
alone. There does not appear to be any very firm rule governing which word or
words should be used in any particular case except that YOO is not generally
used if the verb is one indicating physical movement from one place to another.

"— 9 —011LESSON 1. B:
THE ALPHABET AND SPELLING.
1. B. 1. General.
(a). The Thai alphabet consists of a series of consonants and another entirely
separate series of vowels, which latter are again divided into simple and
compound vowels.
The compound vowels are made up of combinations of a simple vowel with
certain consonants or of two or more simple vowels used together as one.
In addition to the consonants and vowels, there are four symbols which
represent combined consonant and vowel sounds. These however are not
very often met with.
There is no comprehensive alphabetical order which includes both
consonants and vowels as in European languages; each series has to be
learned separately in its own order.
In Thai writing there are no capital letters and no punctuaion and no
break is made between words although a break may be made between groups
of words at the writer’s discretion.
(b). When writing Thai consonants we always start with the little curl if any.
When pronouncing Thai consonants we always add the vowel sound
“OR” after them. (American sound “Aw”)
e.g.fl = G
= NGis pronouncedGORis pronouncedNGORMany consonants have a different sound depending on whether they
are used as initial consonants at the beginning of a syllable or as final consonants at the end of the syllable.
e.g.ftas an initial consonant at the beginning of a
syllable has the sound of the English S but as
a final consonant has the sound of T.(c). In the Thai alphabet there are many groups of consonants in which each
member of the group has exactly the same sound.
For instance ff, B and £1 all have the sound S and are all spokenas SOR.
Obviously it is necessary to have some method of distinguishing between
— 10 —these letters when referring to them verbally and this the Thai do by giving
each letter a name.
This name is usually a noun, the spelling of which incorporates the consonant concerned and is considered to be generally familiar to most literates.
In a few cases the name is descriptive referring to the appearance of the
consonant and its similarity to another consonant.","[24, 25, 26]"
"When we use SEE-A in the sense of “to spend money or time”, there is the
slight implication that the time or money has been wasted or spent to little
purpose, but this distinction is rather falling into disregard in normal conversation and you need not worry too much about it.
SEE-A is also used in another way at the end of a sentence to indicate completeness or finality. This usage is rather complicated and quite beyond the
scope of this book but it is mentioned here as you are sure to come across it
in conversation and reading and all you need to know is not to try and translate it.
MOT means “finished”, “used up” and is very often added after other words
to indicate “completeness”

ASYou may find it difficult at first to pronounce all the syllables of a
polysyllabic word in the correct tone but luckily there are very few words of
more than two syllables where the tonal values of the syllables vary, so that even
if the tone of one or more syllables is not quite correct the combination of
syllables alone will usually distinguish the word without ambiguity. The tone
of each word in the vocabularies is indicated as shown above and the same
system is used for all words in the extended vocabulary at the end of the book
but for clarity and simplicity of printing the tones are not shown in the romanized version of the examples throughout the text.
By far the best way to learn the tones at the beginning is the way a
Thai child does, i.e. by copying a natural Thai speaker, and as this book is
intended to be used with the help of a Thai teacher we recommend you just to
listen to your teacher and try to imitate the way he pronounces the words and
correlate this with the tone indications given in the vocabularies.
In Thai writing the tones are quite clearly indicated by the use of Tone
Marks coupled with a rather complicated set of rules but as the understanding
of these rules depends on a thorough knowledge of the Thai alphabet it is quite
meaningless to discuss them until you have first mastered the alphabet. The full
consideration of the tone rules has therefore been left until lessons 10 to 19.
1. A. 1. (b.) Grammar Notes.
The general arrangement of a simple Thai sentence is Subject-VerbObject as in English.
There are no Articles for use with nouns.
There is no inflection of nouns, pronouns or verbs ; case, gender, number, tense etc. being indicated where considered necessary by the addition of
other words.
Possession may be indicated by adding the word KORNG “of”
“belonging to” in front of the noun or pronoun but this is often omitted.
Plurality if not indicated by the text of the sentence may be indicated
by adding numeral words.
Inanimate objects have no gender and where it is necessary to indicate
gender in relation to animate objects this is usually done by the addition of
extra words.
Adjectives come after the noun they qualify.
— 3 —Affirmative and interrogative sentences are of the same form; the
interrogative sentence being indicated by the addition of an interrogative word,
usually at the end of the sentence.
The word MY expressed in a rising tone at the end of a sentence is probably
the most common interrogative word and denotes a question. Its use is analogous to that of the English word “NG?” as often used by Latin peoples at the
end of a sentence in English to donate a question.
“You will come tomorrow, No?”= Will you come tomorrow? When
an interrogative sentence contains words such as “who”, “why”, “when”,
“where” etc. no other interrogative word is needed.
In colloquial Thai and also to a lesser extent in writing it is customary
to leave out pronouns, prepositions and other words provided that the intention
of the sentence appears to be otherwise adequately expressed. On the other
hand words which have little or no meaning in the context in which they are
being used and are often quite incapable of translation are frequently inserted
in a sentence to make it sound more complete and euphonious.
Words which may be omitted are shown in brackets in the examples.","[17, 18, 19]"

CONVERSATION
10. A. 1 Classifiers or Designatory Particles.
Classifiers or Designatory Particles are words used mainly with concrete nouns to designate and specify the unit used in counting or referring to
them.
In English when we say “a head of cattle”, “a lump of ice”, “a bottle of beer”
the words “head”, “lump”, “bottle” are what would in Thai be called Classifiers.
The use of these classifiers is far more widespread in Thai than in English and
you cannot even begin to speak acceptable Thai until you have thoroughly
mastered their use.
Any one classifier generally applies to a group of nouns all of which
are considered as having some common feature though this is not always
apparent at first sight.
For instance ;
KONc.mi is the classifier for all persons.","[126, 127, 128]"

fairly common in writing.
It mostly occurs at the beginning of a sentence and although it cannot be translated in any consistent way it can be considered as similar to the conjunction

As will be seen from the following examples, any attempt to adhere to the Thai
word order or to translate the sentence word by word usually produces a very
clumsy result in English.

CONVERSATION2. A. 1. (a). Grammar Notes.
A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of
the verb or, in certain cases, after it. (See Lesson 7.)
When a negative word qualifies an adjective it is usually placed between
the noun and the adjective (Example 21.)
The future tense is indicated by putting the word JA “will”, “shall”
in front of the verb.
In most cases questions in the future tense can be answered in the
present tense.
The answer to a question is generally made as short as possible and in
many cases will consist only of a repetition of the verb in the case of an affirmative answer, or the verb preceded by a negative word in the case of a negative
answer.
The position of adverbs and adverbial clauses is variable. Generally the
adverb of time comes at the beginning of the sentence but we can add emphasis
to it by putting it at the end.
Other adverbs and adverbial clauses may go either at the beginning or end of
the sentence but the position of each particular one is usually fairly constant.
Adverbs or adverbial clauses seldom come in the middle of a sentence. For
instance;
“Go to the market and buy some eggs”
would be rendered in Thai as,
“Go buy some eggs at the market”
Interrogative adverbs and some adverbs of time such as “always”, “often”,
“soon” etc. are usually placed at the end of the sentence.","[30, 31]"
"UM1HAANG1PlacesoinONGcKings, queens, priests, princes.az
OUUNcMiscellaneous small objects.",[384]
"The Thai language is a “Tonal Language” which means that a word
may have two or more distinct and quite unrelated meanings depending on the
tone in which it is pronounced.
Altogether there are five tones but there is no single word which is
pronounced in all five although there are a number which may be pronounced
in two or three and carry a different meaning in each.
Most newcomers to the language are rather appalled at the apparent
difficulty of the tones but they are not as hard as is generally imagined even for
people with no musical ear.
A great many words in common use take only one tone and even where
a word has two or three tones, each with a different meaning, in most cases the
word you intend to use will be made clear by the context provided you get the
construction of the sentence right even though your tone may not be quite
correct.
The five tones are;
(i). The High Tone.
This, is a uniform tone pitched well above the level of the
speaker’s normal voice and is similar to the tone used in English to denote alarm.
e.g. “keep away”
It is indicated in the vocabularies by “h”
A birdNOKhTo loveRUKhSmallLEKhun
■fn
tan(ii). The Rising Tone.
This as the name implies has a rising inflection and is something
like the tone used in English to denote surprise or a question

EXTENDED ENGLISH-THAI VOCABULARY.
The Extended Vocabulary which follows contains all the words you
have had in the various sectional vocabularies as well as a large number of others
which are in fairly common use; about 2600 altogether.
Be a little careful about picking new words out of the vocabulary and
using them. If they are nouns y®u can’t go far wrong as in most cases any one
noun can be substituted for another but adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and
verbs are very often used in certain contexts only and if you use them wrongly
you will not be understood.
For instance; POP (Mil) means “to meet” but “to meet someone at the airport”
is RUP ( A l ) “to receive”.
Again “for rent” is HY CHOW ( I n i ' l l ) and you cannot use SUMRUP CHOW.
You are more likely to be understood if you get the construction right even
if some of the tones are wrong than if all your tones are faultless but you use
the wrong words and get the rhythm of the sentence wrong. If you want to try
new words, and you should, check up with your teacher or a Thai friend first
if possible.
Where a word has been dealt with specifically in a particular lesson
the number of the lesson is added after the word and this to some extent serves
as an index to the words with special usage. In most cases an example showing
the usage will be found in the lesson referred to or the following one.
In order to save space many of the more obvious compound words
have been omitted as you should now be able to make these up yourself.
e.g. TOOK “every” TOOK KON “everyone” TOOK WUN “everyday” etc.
Thai words and syllables in brackets are those which are often omitted
in conversation.
e.g. LORT FY (FAR) “electric light bulb”. Usually called LORT FY.
No significance attaches to the fact that the English approximation
of the Thai spelling is sometimes written as two or more words; this is merely
done for clarity and to help in separation of the syllables.
The tones of all words are shown by the small letters after the English
approximation using the following convention.
— 414 —c Common tone
r Rising tone
1 Low tone
d Dropped tone
h High tone.
No Thai-English vocabulary is given because any such list would be
either too bulk}7 or else very inadequate and if you are going to do any reading
outside this book you will have to get a Thai-English dictionary anyhow.
Of the Thai-English dictionaries available, McFarland, though a little out of
date and rather expensive, is well arranged and contains a vast amount of information not found elsewhere. It is a “must” for any serious student. “The
Student’s Thai-English Dictionary” by Mary Haas of the University of California published in 1964 is a most welcome addition to Thai lexicography, and
gives the pronunciation of every word in phonetic symbols.
It also gives a great number of examples of common idiomatic usage.
The Modern Standard Dictionary by Plang Phloyphrom is a well produced,
cheap and very comprehensive Thai-English Dictionary.
Of the English-Thai dictionaries, the “New Model English-Thai Dictionary”
by So Sethaputra is by far the best although it is compiled for Thai rather than
for students of Thai. It is therefore of real value only to advanced students who
can select the particular word they want from the large number of alternatives
given against each English word.

desirable for clarity and to avoid possible ambiguities in pronunciation. This syllabication has no other significance.","[428, 429, 430]"

20. B. IntroductionIf you have studied the Thai spelling of the words given in the previous
vocabularies and the Thai version of the examples in sections A. 5 of the lessons
up to date, you should now be able to pick out a fair number of Thai words
by their look without still having to spell them out and should be at a stage to
start reading some simple Thai passages.
In part B. of this and the following lessons we give short passages in
Thai to give you practice in separating the individual words and to show you
some of the characteristics of the written language which differs fairly considerably from colloquial Thai in the use of more formal words, rather long and complicated constructions and a considerable number of what appear to be redundant words.
These passages have been taken from Ministry of Education readers,
books, magazines and newspapers so as to cover a number of variations tn style
and, though Thai scholars may consider some of them not very good Thai, they
have all been written originally in Thai by Thai people for Thai readers and are
reproduced here exactly as written. We feel that they can be considered as quite
typical of modern Thai usage.
It has not been possible to select passages containing only words that
you have already had in the vocabularies but any new words are given below
each passage together with explanatory notes where considered necessary and
this should help to enlarge your vocabulary. For the tone of any word refer to
the extended vocabulary Appendix 10.
In the English translation following each passage we have endeavoured
to keep as closely as possible to the literal translation of the Thai so as to bring
out the peculiarities of the Thai phraseology even though in many cases this
results in rathet clumsy and laborious English. Paraphrasing into more suitable
English should present no difficulty.
We would recommend that you proceed as follows :
(a) Read through the whole passage once and try to separate the words
and get a general idea of what it is all about.
Look up in the list below each passage the words which are new
to you as you come to them.
— 253 —Do not take any notice of the spaces between words which occur
from time to time. They do not represent sentences and do not
even correspond very well with punctuation and are best neglected.
They do however enable you to tell where one word ends and the
next begins so just be thankful for them.
(b) Now read through the passage again and if necessary a third time
and see if you can write it down in English.
It is unlikely that you will be able to put it into good English
straight away but that does not matter; you can easily tidy it up
once you have worked out the meaning.
(c) If you get really stuck refer to the English translation below but
try not to do this except as a last resort if you cannot work out the
meaning yourself or if you want to check up your own version.
Translation is an art which only comes with practice and requires a
good vocabulary and a certain amount of mental agility but the following hints
may help you in the early stages.
(1) Do not hesitate to neglect any word which appears to be a mere
duplication or a word added to make the sentence more euphonious. You will find a considerable number of comparatively
redundant words used in almost all Thai writing.
(2) Do not hesitate to add a few extra words, particularly pronouns,
prepositions and conjunctions if they appear necessary to make
sense in English. All Thai writing leaves out a number of words
which would be considered essential in English.
(3) If the context appears to demand that a Thai word should have a
meaning different to that which you have been given in the vocabularies, use that meaning tentatively and see if the whole phrase
hangs together.
The meanings of words in any language depend to some extent
on the situations in which they are used and it is possible in vocabularies to give only the most common and general meanings.
— 254 —(4) If you come across a long word or group of words which you
cannot find in your dictionary try to analyse it into its component
words, put them together and see if you can find a roughly corresponding English phrase.
Thai writing is full of rather flowery expressions and idioms and
the translation of many of these requires a good deal of imagination.
flfUfhvi'NQTH'n KOON KAH TAHNG AH-HAHN
fltU “good”,“goodness”fll“value” ¥114 “away”,0THTJ “food”.
The above combination means “Good value in the way of food”.
(5) In reading newspapers particularly be prepared to find many of
the rules you have learned broken or disregarded and also a number
of misprints and unofficial abbreviations.
The editorial standard of most Thai newspapers is not very high
or very consistent.
(6) If at the end of your translation you are still not quite sure of the
exact meaning, do not get worried about this.
The Asian way of thought and expression is very different from
that of the West and as a rule the Asian deals more with general
ideas rather than with exact relationships.
But lest this lead you into the common error of thinking that Thai
is a very inadequate language in all respects, we would commend
for your consideration the words of that Thai scholar and fluent
English speaker M.L. Pin Malakul, sometime Minister of Education, who, in opening a conference of S.E. Asia Language experts
in Bangkok, said;
“Although we have always been grateful for the use of English
as means of communication with people of other nations, each
of us at some time or other must have found it inadequate as a
medium of expression when it comes to discussing elusive and
abstract subjects such as art, literature, refigion and philosophy.”
— 255 —20. B. 1.","[268, 269, 270, 271]"
"TEE NON ( 1)11414) “at that place over there”.
Note that the second word of these three compound words is always a pronoun and is pronounced in the dropped tone.
In conversation it is quite common to omit the first syllable of all these three
words and merely say NEE, NUN or NON for “here” “there” and “over
there” but you had better start and use the full words until you get more
familiarity with the language and know when to abbreviate and when not to.
TEENY (lllmi)
“where?” This is also often shortned to NY but it is
best to use the word in full.
Note that the second syllable is spelled quite differently in Thai to the word
NY meaning “in” given below in the vocabulary.
MY (111) is the most general word for “not” but you will come across
MI (pronounced with the “I” very short) and it is as well to be aware of it.
You need not use it yourself.
— 7 —BAHN (UTU) is pretty well the same as the English word “home” and is
the common word to use for “a house” or “dwelling place.”
I____91MOO BAHN (MUUTU) which literally means “a group of homes” is the
name for the smallest Thai village group. This is usually referred to by
writers in English as “a hamlet.”
DTUMBON. (fflTUcl) This is an administrative district containing a number of MOO BAHN.
The English word “village” is used rather indiscriminately in referring to
either a MOO BAHN or a DTUMBON but in Thai they are very different.","[22, 23]"
"(Woman speaking)As these two words are “Polite” words indicating respect, they are not
normally used when speaking to sahmlor boys, servants etc. though they should
and probably will be used by them when speaking to you in which case they are
somewhat equivalent to “Sir” or “Madame”.
Under certain circumstances these two words can be used alone and
are equivalent to “Yes” or “I understand” but nevertheless the limitations as to
which sex may use which word still remain. This usage will be dealt with in a
later lesson.
•
We have used these two words in appropriate places in the examples to
these lessons so that you will get used to seeing and hearing and using them,
but which word to use and whether they should be used at all in any
particular sentence depends on your sex and who you consider you are
speaking to.
— 17 —Finally mention should be made of a large group of special words and
phrases known as RAHCHAH SUP which are used by Thai people when referring to or speaking to Royalty and a further group of words used only in reference to or when talking to Buddhist Priests.
It is however beyond the scope of this book to deal further with these highly
complicated and specialized versions of the language.
