"Iu Mien is a verb medial language. The monosyllabic nature of the languagedemands that the word order plays an important role to determine grammaticalrelation. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the language has a strictly
grammaticalised Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern as a basic constituent order.",[39]
"He investigated the NP-internal word order (noun, numeral, classifier, possessor,attributive adjective, relative clause, demonstrative, plural marker) and the NPexternal word order (subject, object, verb, copula, particle, oblique phrase,adposition) in eleven Hmong-Mien languages based on publications authored inChinese. They are Hmong, Hmu, Xong, Iu Mien (of Thailand by Thanyalak Saeliao2012), Bunu, Biao Min, Baheng, Suang, Younuo, Jiongnai, and She. As to the NP-external word order he posits “SVO” (with Ratliff (2010:227-8) quoted in §2.3.1.7) as
follows:All languages in the sample are straightforwardly SVO in pragmatically
neutral clauses, although object-fronting (to either preverbal or clauseinitial position) for discourse-pragmatic purposes is common in all of them.
(As is standard in studies of word order typology, the term “subject” and
“object” are here used in a purely semantic sense, with the former referring
to the more agent-like argument of a transitive clause and the latter to the
more patient-like argument of such a clause) (Sposato 2014:111).
This is a good starting point to present our alternative view on the sacrosanct “SVO”
hypothesis as will be discussed in Chapter 4. It is true that the word order matters inIu Mien and it does show the ‘SVO’ order but the question is in what sense it does so.",[116]
"However, this fact does not nullify our claim that Iu Mien is not primarily an SVO
language but pragmatics plays more important role in the word-order choice. Note
the contrastive examples of Downer (1973:14-16), quoted above, between the
transitive clause (748) and the intransitive clause (749):(748)koigaenghคอยแก้งkʰɔi˦kɛŋ˧˩open(vt) door
‘open the door’
(Downer 1973:16)
(749)nqoibianghฆอยเปี้ ยงgɔi˦pʲaŋ˧˩open(vi) flower
‘to blossom’
(Downer 1973:16)
Why the reverse order biangh nqoi [flower open] is unacceptable must be discussed in
§11.4Another reminder that we do not abandon our stance that Iu Mien is notstrictly an SVO language comes from LaPolla’s (2002) argument as follows:[...] a language that has not grammaticalized the syntactic category of
subject will often have a relatively free word order based on pragmatics
(usually information structure and/or animacy); [...] Assuming agent is
equivalent to subject in all languages then is very problematic.
Most studies on word order take a sentence type with two full lexical
NP’s as the basic order order, and from this draw conclusions about the587entire grammar of the language, but it has been shown that in natural
discourse this type of sentence is relatively rare and marked (LaPolla
2002:206).","[623, 624]"
"4.2.6 Basic Constituent Order at the Sentence LevelThis section argues for the basicness of Topic-Focus word order. Contrary to acommon view that Iu Mien is an SVO language, such a word order in its bare form inisolation is rather rare. Though there are instances of SVO, they are just
epiphenomenal as the better explanation is with recourse to pragmatic principles
rather than to syntactic one. Pragmatically explained, Topic occurs preverbally and
Focus postverbally.",[260]
"Another implication of Principle 3, that is, the principle that the verb-medialword order does not mean the language is grammaticalised in the order SVO, is thesuccessful analysis of the seemingly post-verbal subject. The post-verbal NP is not the
subject nor an object. A new participant, which is not the established topic, isintroduced to the discourse by the entity-presentative verb maaih ‘there was a…’. In
such a construction, the non-topical NP occurs post-verbally, i.e., on the right side ofthe verb. Other than this, in the constructions of the meteorological happening, theunexpected emergence, the inexorability all occur post-verbally. When theseconstructions are preceded by a topic NP, the appearance is NP+VS. However, suchan understanding does not explain anything. These are the event-presentativeconstructions, in which the topic may occur pre-verbally, and the non-topical but
focal-NP occurs post-verbally. This is the principle of verb-medial order, not an SVO.
We have argued this issue in Chapter 11.",[860]
"4.2.6.1 An isolated SVO order is rareIf one asks whether Iu Mien is an SVO language or not, the answer found inthis section is negative. This typological feature is commonly referred to. For example,Blake (2001:15) summarises in terms of relation between the word order andgrammatical case: “The SVO ‘caseless’ languages are concentrated in western Europe
(e.g. English), southern Africa (e.g. Swahili) and east and southeast Asia (e.g. Chinese
and Vietnamese)”. In other words, Iu Mien, like Thai and Lao adding to those in theparentheses above, does not use case marking but the word order to indicategrammatical relations. Indeed, Clark (1989:178-9) argues for the SVO order in Hmong
and Thanyalak Saeliao (2012) likewise considers Iu Mien to be an SVO language.",[260]
"On the other hand, in the cases of post-pendent clauses, i.e., Purpose clause: [weic-CL2]SUB ‘in order that , so that’
 Reason clause: [weic.zuqc-CL2]SUB ‘because’ Simile clause: [hnangv-CL2-(wuov) nor]SUB ‘like, as if’,
the principle of iconicity (i.e. concrete information first, abstract information
afterward) is at work. The summary of these points are in Figure 68:770APrinciple of Topic-Focus (Rightward focus)Main ClausePre-pendent ClauseCause, concessive, temporal,

(Figure from Arisawa 2015, SEALS25)ComplementationNoonan (2007:52) defines a sentential complementation as “the syntacticsituation that arises when a notional sentence or predication is an argument of apredicate”. He further distinguishes “subject complements” (i.e. clauses which act as
sentential subject) and “object complements” (i.e. clauses which act as objects ofpredicates). In this section object complements are discussed. As for the complementsthat act as topics, they have been discussed in Chapter 10, where a clause is treated
as a topic in many cases.","[806, 807]"
"First, typologically Iu Mien is perceived as topic-prominent language, ratherthan an SVO language even though this word order does occur in it. This topicorientation feature is realised in the constituent order that topic-on-the-left and
comment-on-the-right in a sentence. The first part of this chapter lays out the mostcommon sentence structure of the language as a general framework of analyses, which
will steer the course of all discussions for the rest of this grammar.",[239]
"4.2.6.3 Topic occurs preverbally, focus postverballyFor the sake of easy reference to the surface structure, we will use thetraditional terms “subject” and “object” only in the very loose sense as Sposato (2014)
does as has been quoted in §2.3.1.10:As is standard in studies of word order typology, the term “subject” and
“object” are here used in a purely semantic sense, with the former referring
to the more agent-like argument of a transitive clause and the latter to the
more patient-like argument of such a clause (Sposato 2014:111).
But more importantly, what really is going on underneath the surface structurehas already been said about Chinese by LaPolla (1993, 1995, 2002, 2003), and we
shall adhere to the principle, which is true to the constituent order in the Iu Mien
sentence:topical or non-focal NPs occur preverbally and focal or non-topical NPs
occur post-verbally (LaPolla 1995:310). (italicised in the original)Several different terms have been coined, e.g., “adversive passive” (Givón 2008), “adversative
passive” (Ratliff (2010:8), Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_voice)), “adversity
passive” (Fuller 1985). Ratliff’s term for the areal feature including Hmong (adversative passives) is
used in this study due to the regional vicinity with Iu Mien.
102231Pragmatics Determines Semantic Roles of Argument NPsLaPolla’s (1995:310) statement quoted in the last section (§4.2.6.3) is almostaxiomatic when it comes to argument structures in Iu Mien. It is not a word order
(e.g. SVO) or syntax that determines which NP is treated as a core argument in relation
to a predicate verb in a sentence. It is neither semantic roles of NPs that account for
grammatical facts about core arguments. Rather, it is pragmatics that determinessemantic roles of argument NPs. This is summarised in the seventh principle, which
reads as follows:Principle 7. The argument structure in Iu Mien, or the relationship between
verbs and NPs in a sentence, is aligned by pragmatics, specifically by the
verb’s rich cultural semantic frame. That is, cultural knowledge around the
event or situation the verb designates determines what should be treated as
core arguments.
The following sections (§§4.3.1–4) offer the breakdowns of the overallstatement regarding NP roles in arguments: pragmatics, rather than syntax or
semantics, determines semantic roles of argument NPs based on a combination of
Principle 1 and Principle 2, and on a context of an utterance.","[267, 268]"
"Furthermore, to say that Iu Mien is an SVO language cannot explain a clauselike (153a) while Thai, a language spoken in the vicinity of Iu Mien, shows the
opposite word order as in (153b):(153a) duih mbiungciumตุย้บยูง่tui˧˩bʲuŋ˩fall rain
‘It is raining/it rains.’
It might be correct to say that Thai is an SV(O) language since we find the next
example (153b) to describe the same situation as (153a) in Iu Mien:229(153b) fǒntòkThaiตกฝนrain fall
‘It is raining/it rains.’
So then, how should we describe Iu Mien? LaPolla and Poa (2006) argue:
Each language is a unique set of language-specific conventions, and so each
language should be described in its own terms (LaPolla 2003). That is, when
describing a language, we should not assume that there are universal
categories of grammatical relations, and that word order in all languages
can be explained using them, for example making statements such as “X is
an SOV language”; we should describe for each language the principles that
determine the word order patterns found in that language (LaPolla and Poa
2006:270).
Furthermore, LaPolla and Poa argue for the same points regarding Chinese:
In fact given the pragmatic principle for determining word order in Chinese,
we would expect to find actors more frequently before the verb and patients
more frequently after the verb, as cross-linguistically actors are more often
topical, while patients are more often focal. It is the pragmatic nature of the
actor as topic that results in the NP referring to the actor often appearing in
clause-initial position, and the pragmatic nature of the patient as focal that
results in the NP referring the patient often appearing in post-verbal position
(LaPolla and Poa 2006:281).
This being plausibly applied to Iu Mien, what does it mean to say Iu Mien is a verb
medial language? Quoting LaPolla and Poa again for Chinese:[…] we should say that Chinese clauses are often (though not obligatorily)
verb medial, as NPs representing topical and non-focal referents appear
before the verb and focal and NPs representing non-topical referents appear
after the verb, with the position of any NPs appearing in the clause (none
are obligatory) before or after the verb being based on their nature as topical
or as part of the focus respectively (LaPolla and Poa 2006:281).
Therefore, what is the lesson learned? Drawing on insights from the analysesof other languages in Southeast Asia attracted by their similarity is helpful but itshould be done with a careful attention on the structure of Iu Mien in its own terms.
Yet, the insights from Chinese by Chao, LaPolla, LaPolla and Poa quoted above
buttressed with the recent research on information structure seem to be applicable toIu Mien. The issue of argument structure in conjunction with information structure in
sentences reflected in constituent order therein will be discussed in detail in Chapter
11.","[265, 266]"
"In a certain subgroup of clause (i.e. with the verbs of change of state or weatherverbs), the V–NP order (seemingly VS) order is observed, e.g., {fall} {rain}, as opposedto other single argument clauses which is realised in the NP-V order, e.g., {bird} {fly}.
Languages without morphological inflections often have versatile use of verbsand this tendency is obvious in Iu Mien. Besides regular lexical meaning of verbs, acertain class of verbs can function as words that indicate aspect, modality, and
directional movement. As a result, a sentence may contain a series of verbs, e.g.,
{modal verb} {main verb} {aspectual verb} {directional verb}. Tense is not indicatedin the verb but by adverbial phrases of time, typically placed after the topic and before
the main verb, e.g., {I} {tomorrow} {go} {to market}. Here again topicalisation of
time phrase is possible, e.g., {tomorrow} {I} {go} {to market}.",[40]
"Though it is apparent that the clause containing gau functions as a temporalsequential prependent clause, an attention may be drawn to the NP hnaangx ‘rice’,
which is seemingly dislocated or detached from the verb zouv ‘to cook’. This veryposition of gau again may be a piece of evidence that the constituent order “so-calledSVO” is not grammaticalised in Iu Mien. It should be recalled that this loose verbmedial order is an entailment of Principle 3: “Iu Mien is a verb-medial language inwhich the positions of Topic (possibly realised as AGENT) and Focus (possibly
containing THEME) are pragmatically assigned. Even though a sentence in which Topicis realised as A and Focus containing TH has an appearance “SVO”, the word order is
not necessarily grammaticalised” (§4.2.1).",[798]

"Interlace of the Seven Principles with Chapter 6 to 20In this grammar, we have argued for and established the following sevenoperational principles that are working in the structure of Iu Mien language in such a
manner that they are interlaced:(1) topic-focus orientation,
(2) multilayered focus structure with prominence on the sentence final position,
(3) verb-medial word order, not necessarily SVO,
(4) versatility of verbs used for aspect, modality, multi-verb constructions, etc.,
(5) sentence final particles as epistemic grounding elements,
(6) vague distinction across “parts-of-speech”,
(7) culturally affected argument structure, i.e. the relationship between verbs and
noun phrases in a sentence.
The gist of the seven, i.e., the crux of Chapter 4, is that Iu Mien is apragmatically configured verb-medial language and it is not an SVO language in thesense that the word order is strictly grammaticalised. In the overall bipartite sentencetemplate with the verb in the middle, the topic argument NP occurs pre-verbally; and
the focal argument NP and the event presentative NP occurs post-verbally. Althoughthis order may have a guise of an SVO order, the principle operates not only with the
verbal predicate but also with non-verbal predicate, i.e. equative particles (not verbs).
Thus, two major parts of the sentence are topic and focus, whether what comes823between them are verbs, verbal adjectives, copular verbs or equative particles, or
sentence medial topic markers. Given these facts, to say that Iu Mien is an SVOlanguage is to address only a small number of constructions that have such surface
appearance in the language.","[859, 860]"

"Firstly, a reverse order of NP1 and NP2 in a two-argument structure [NP1 VNP2] shows that NP1 is an A argument and NP2 an O/P argument, and that thus V is a
transitive verb, because the change of the order affects the meaning of the clause.",[620]

"The term “ground and figure” can be understood in other terms such as “themeand rheme”, “topic and focus”, “generic and particular”, “margin and nucleus” and“broad and specific” to borrow from various schools of linguistics. And at thisintroductory stage, it is roughly correct to say that majority of constituent order in IuMien follow the order of “from theme to rheme”, “from topic to focus”, “from general
to particular”, “from margin to nucleus” and “from broad to specific”. In other words,the construction that is in the state of ground, theme, topic, general, margin, broad,
occurs on the left side of a sentence, i.e., sentence-initially. On the other hand, the
construction that is in the state of figure, rheme, focus, particular, nucleus, specific,appears on the right side, i.e., sentence-finally. Schematically expressed in Figure 46:

understanding that majority of these theories and authors agree on a main point inregard to topic and focus. The first five rows of Figure 46 will be briefly presented in

of this stance will be explicated in Chapter 4.",[116]
"Typological CharacteristicsAwaiting Chapter 4 to present detailed typological characteristics, this sectiongives an overview. Many common areal (i.e. regional) features of languages in
Southeast Asia are observed in Iu Mien (Enfield and Comrie (eds.) 2015:7-9). That is,
Iu Mien is characterized by phonemic tone, a strong tendency toward monosyllabicity,isolating morphology and therefore the importance of word order. It is a discourse
dependent and topic-focus language. Versatility5 of lexical verbs being used as variousfunctional words manifests in aspect and modality markings, and multi-verb
constructions or serial verb constructions.",[38]
"Rather, the speaker’s attitude and perception, i.e., volitionality or non-volitionality,
determines the word order.",[647]
"Linguistic EnvironmentSoutheast Asia is a home to vast linguistic diversity, embracing five majorlinguistics phyla or families. According to Matisoff (2001:295-8) the following
families are recognised:The forward slash ‘/’ indicates the boundary between left-position element (i.e. topic) and the rest of
the clause following Enfield’s Lao grammar (2007:4). It should be noted that terms like “preposed” or
“dislocated” are not used in that the frequency of this constituent order is much higher than so-called
“SVO” order in Iu Mien.

"2254.2.6.2 Basicness of Topic-Focus orderWhile the SVO order does occur at the clause level in Iu Mien, the topic-focusorder is dominant in actual speech events and discourse. Li and Thompson (1976), intheir classic argument of distinguishing the subject (at clause/sentence level) and the
topic (at discourse level), characterize a topic language as follows:Perhaps the most striking difference between a Tp language and a non-Tp
language is the extent to which the topic-comment sentence can be
considered to be part of the repertoire of basic sentence types in the former
but not in the latter. (1976:471)
Similarly, what Chao (1968) says about Chinese is also true to Iu Mien. BothChinese and Iu Mien exhibit a sentence such as (147a) and (147b):(147a) Juvngaatc mienh.","[261, 262]"

"The purpose of this section is to respond to the following analyses by Sposato(2014) particularly concerning with the “VS order”:As the examples below show, all eleven Miao-Yao languages [Hmong,
Hmu, Xong, Iu Mien, Bunu, Biao Min, Baheng, Suang, Younuo, Jiongnai,
She] examined are predominantly SV. The opposite order, VS, does occur
in many of these languages as well, but it does so far less often. In most
cases VS order also seems to be restricted to particular verbs and/or
discourse-pragmatic environments, though these issues are rarely afforded
any explicit discussion by the authors196 of the sources used here (Sposato
2014:114).
Despite the scarcity of the discussion on the restricted choice of verbs that occur inthe “VS order” and its discourse-pragmatic-conditions by the authors he used, thefollowing delineations are presented from our data. To summarise them beforehand,
endorsing the argumentation for Chinese by LaPolla (1995) and LaPlla and Poa
(2006), it is analysed that so-called “VS order” in Iu Mien occurs in an “entity-centralpresentative” construction and an “event-central presentative” construction. In both

"Since the passive voice in languages in which Agent/Subject and Patient/Object are
morphologically marked and syntactically grammaticalised, it would be more
appropriate to say that Iu Mien does not have such a construction. Rather, it uses an
adversative (oradversity) 102 /malefactive coverb construction(i.e.zuqc‘[TOUCHADVERSATIVE]’) as in (i). This topic will be delineated in §§17.4–6 under the title
“benefactive and malefactive”.",[267]

The guise of Verb-Subject order (§11.4)4.2.5 Utterances, Sentences, and WordsThis section has to do with Principle 6: Sentence final particles (SFPs)semantically and pragmatically play multiple roles, and function as grounding
elements though optional. The gist of the section is that a sentence is optionallymarked by an SFP. That is, it is safe to consider that if a hearer recognises an SFP,
then the sentence is complete.","[256, 257]"
"Firstly, the use of the prepositive order of the Chinese-loan adjectives is clearlydistinguished from the use of the postpositive order in the native Iu Mien adjectivalverbs among the older speakers, who usually know Chinese. The evidence has beenamply shown in the previous sections: e.g., loz-hnoi ‘old days’ in (1-17), (4-1), (160-5) or
Loz-Zanh ‘the Old Zan clan’ in (161-1), where the Chinese-loan adjective loz- modifiesa noun prepositively with tone sandhi, i.e., [AdjTS·NHD], as opposed to, e.g., nyaam-hlo‘big (principal) daughter-in-law’ in (185) and ong-gox ‘an old grandpa’ in (275a),
where the postpositive order with tone sandhi, i.e., [NHDTS·VADJ], is employed.",[387]

The point is that behind the same word order, V-NP, there lies two differentstructures. To use the semantic role terminology ((A)GENT, (TH)eme) introduced in
§4.3.1, rather than the term “(S)VO”, two different structures can be shown as follows:

Ninh(A) cuotv qiex(TH)
Cuotv waac(TH)[3SG produce voice] (lit.) ‘He/she produces voice.’
[exit word]‘(There) emerged/occurred a problem.’To retrieve the deferred example (200c) nqaiv cuotv ‘faeces came out’, the verb cuotv
is intransitive (“SV” in terms of “SVO language”). Thus the third structure:
Nqaiv(TH) cuotv[faeces exit]‘Faeces came out.’Now, returning to the onomastics-derived grammar, cuotv as a performativenomination verb is of the first kind among the above three, i.e., (200a) [cuotv +
NP(TH)]. Hence the reading of cuotv mbuox is ‘to produce a name, issue a name’.",[355]

VERBS AND ARGUMENT STRUCTURE
IntroductionThe main theme of this chapter is the argument structure. Two importantsections are (i) the structures with one-, two-, and three-argument (§11.2), and (ii)the issue of the seemingly post-verbal subject, which has the order V-NP (§11.3 and
§11.4). Admittedly the former category needs further research (e.g. distinction
between obvious transitive verbs and ambitransitive verbs in two-argumentstructures, and change of ditransitive (three-argument) structures to coverbcontaining clauses), but a main purpose of this chapter is limited to present basicforms of each construction. The latter construction will be analysed in terms of theentity-presentative constructions (§11.3.1) and the event-presentative constructions
(§11.3.2). The construction [V-NP] encodes natural (meteorological) happening,unexpected emergence/appearance, and inexorability (§11.4). On the other hand, the
construction [NP-V] encodes volitional agent.","[610, 611]"
"To such variability of Chinese-loan adjectives we propose the followingrationale in terms of speaker’s age: namely, the older speakers who know Chineseorigin of particular adjectives, on the one hand, use the prepositive order and use the
native Iu Mien adjectival verbs postpositively. The younger speakers who areunfamiliar with Chinese, on the other hand, tend to use all adjectives (includingChinese-loan and native Iu Mien) in the postpositive order. Also, we suggest three
stages in which a certain group of Chinese-loan adjectives fully become Iu Mien
adjectival verbs. Evidence indicating them are presented as follows.",[387]
"There are two word orders in the spatial relator noun constructions. The oneis a postpositional relator noun construction, and the other, a prepositional relator
noun construction. To express the spatial relationship inside the house in English or
Thai we use the prepositional construction. Its counterpart in Iu Mien, however, usesthe opposite order, i.e., biaov ga’nyuuoz /pʲau˦˥˧ ka ɲuə˨˧˩/ [house inside]. In contrast,
the reverse order ga’nyuuoz biaov [inside house] means ‘around the general area ofinside toward the house’. Thus, the postpositional relator noun constructions and theprepositional relator noun constructions differ in semantics. Confusion about the
distinction among the young Iu Mien is due to the fact that the latter kind of use is
absent in Thai even though the structure {inside}{house} (ข้างในบ้าน) has the same
appearance with the Iu Mien ga’nyuoz biauv /ka ɲuə˨˧˩ pʲau˦˥˧/ [inside house]. This
problem will be solved at the end of this section.",[740]
"Therefore, the basic constituent order at the sentence level in Iu Mien is asfollows:St = ±Vocative +Topic ±SentenceMedial +FocusClause ±GroundingElement,
in which the Topic and Focus are obligatory (+) whereas the Sentence-initial
vocative, the Sentence-Medial Element (i.e. copula), and the Grounding Element are
optional (±).",[263]
"In his analysis, dorn is connected to the preceding “first-order compound” mbiauhyaangh [rice yellow] with a “double hyphen ‘=’” according to his way of hyphenation;
thus, mbiauh-yaangh=dorn ‘a late-growing kind of yellow rice’. His analysis of a“second-order compound” can be expressed with an underline and an arrow as (290):(290)mbiauhyaanghdornเบยี้ยวย่างตอนbʲau˧˩jaːŋ˧˩tɔn˦rice

(Court 1986:116)349Zanh Gueix-Fong, however, points out that dorn is related to Chinese zǐ ~ zi (子) ‘son, boy’, rather than an adjective. Furthermore, an evidence for dorn being a
noun is the possibility of inserting the subordinate-cum-possessive particle nyei
between the constituents yielding the meaning ‘son (child) of yellow rice’:(284) mbiauh yaangh dorn < mbiauh yaangh nyei dorn [rice.yellow SBCP son] ‘son ofyellow rice’ = ‘young yellow rice’(285) juv-dorn /cu˧˩ tɔn˦/ [dog SONDMNT] ‘puppy’ < juv nyei dorn [dog SBCP son] ‘son

adjectivesSome adjectives match only (i) and (iv) of the criteria listed in the previoussection (§6.5.2.1), going against (ii) and (iii). In other words, some adjectives occurboth prepositively and postpositively. As to the variable orders of [AdjTS·NHD] versus
[NHDTS·VADJ], Court states:The variability of adjective placement is just another example of the general
variability of modifier placement in Mien nominal compounds (Court
1986:128).
Having said that, Court himself recognises general rules about two classes ofadjectives: (a) “the prepositive-adjective pattern” (1986:127-8) is an established order
with regard to Chinese-derived adjectives and (b) “[t]he ‘aft-’ adjective is the norm”(1986:129), namely, the pattern [NHDTS·VADJ] is the usual order with regard to nonChinese derived adjectives, i.e., the native Iu Mien adjectival verbs.","[385, 386]"
