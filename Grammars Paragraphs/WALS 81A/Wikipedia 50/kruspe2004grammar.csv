"9 Grammatical relations, constituent
order and coding strategiesIn Chapter 9 the discussion centres around grammatical relations, constituent order
and coding strategies. In addition to the three grammatical relations A, S, O, a fourth
member, indirect object (10), is identified. The IO exhibits dual membership - it is
coded as an oblique in a prepositional phrase, but exhibits the syntactic behaviour
associated with a core role (§9.1.4).
The most frequently employed constituent order is verb initial, with either A and
O, or S placed after the verb. Various pragmatically determined permutations are
possible, and these are outlined in §9.2.
The coding of grammatical relations is dependent on the transitivity of the clause,
and it is in accordance with this distinction that they are discussed in §9.3.
The minimal clause in Semelai consists of just the predicate. The means of
representation of NPs in the clause and zero anaphora are discussed in §9.4.","[274, 275]"
"9.2 Constituent order
Constituent order in Semelai is neither fixed nor free, but fluid, allowing a range of
variations which are outlined below. Hence, constituent order alone does not encode
grammatical relations. In fact, a degree of ambiguity is frequently encountered and
semantic/pragmatic plausibility must be relied upon in order to determine
grammatical relations.
There is, then, no single basic order in Semelai. Constituent order is determined
by the transitivity of the clause and the internal temporal structure of the event, in
conjunction with factors motivated by discourse organisation, e.g. the tendency for
new information to precede old. In the case of intransitive clauses obtained through
direct elicitation, S precedes the verb, while in transitive clauses there is a tendency
for verb initial structures. This is not always reflected in spontaneous discourse.
The function of the variations in constituent order is to focus or foreground certain
constituents. An example is the role-marked pronominal S used post-verbally to
mark a change in direction in the discourse, or the end of a scene in a narrative. This
is illustrated in the following example where the woman has just given birth and
instructs the tiger to take the placenta and bury it. In the second line where the
woman has finished her statement, and in the final clause in the scene, the S follows
the predicate, rather than preceding it.

precedes new information which is contained in the predicate. The foregrounding of2569 Grammatical relations, constituent order and coding strategiesnew information places the predicate before the subject as in (50) above. For

distinction.

"38011 Complex clauses11.5 Connective clauses
This section deals with the concatenation of clauses where the interclausal semantic
relationship is overtly marked - one clause contains a connective explicitly
indicating the causal, temporal or conditional connection between the two clauses.
The concatenation is considered a single complex construct, i.e. a sentence. It should
be noted that some of these relationships, temporal, simultaneous and conditional,
may also be expressed without the use of a lexical morpheme. Lexically unspecified
concatenation is discussed in §11.4.
The same set of connectives is also used in interclausal relations as discourse
connectives. They provide textual cohesion, marking temporal relations between
consecutive independent clauses, for example marking back reference (§11.5.4).
In the following discussion, there is no classification of the connectives in terms
of coordination or subordination as there is no evidence which allows the distinction
to be convincingly substantiated. For example, the criteria for subordination
suggested in Thompson and Longacre (1985) are the presence of: a) a grammatical
morpheme, b) a special verb form and c) special word order. Semelai exhibits only
the first of these characteristics, the morpheme. What would appear to be reduced
verb forms are in fact simply standard cases of discourse-motivated elision as in the
first two clauses in (221), and there is no evidence of changes in constituent order in
the adverbial clause, as in (221)-(222). (Constituent order in basic clauses is
discussed in §9.2.)

mortarThompson and Longacre suggest that preference for ordering the adverbial clause in

simply reflects a more general ordering in terms of the logical structure of the
relationship. The clause containing the connective is dependent, but it is only
dependent semantically as the secondary clause. This point is taken up below.","[407, 408]"

Semelai has clearly distinguished word classes, both syntactically
and morphologically. The open classes are nominal, verb and expressive.
The nominal superclass includes nouns, as well as the following closed classes:
numerals, pronouns, demonstratives and ignoratives. Nominals function as the heads
of NPs, predicates in non-verbal clauses and nominal modifiers in associative
constructions.
Verbs function as predicates. The majority of verbs are clearly transitive or
intransitive; there is also a small number of ambitransitive verbs. The distinction
between stative and active verbs cuts across the transitive/intransitive division.
Intransitive verbs also distinguish an adjective class.
Expressives 3 are iconic utterances, which function to simultaneously provide
information about both the predicate and its arguments, in the form of a single lexical
item. They function as clausal adjuncts, or stand alone as minor clauses.
Members of this class express sensate imagery - aural, visual, oral, tactile - e.g.
torjboc 'short and fat (of people)'. Expressives frequently combine a cluster of
properties, e.g. the lexical item br?ol '(s.th.) large, dark and motionless lying
submerged in the water' combines dimension, colour and position. In addition, they
exhibit irregular phonology, irregular reduplication patterns and vowel alternation.
The closed classes are preposition, adverb, auxiliary, existential and ascriptive
predicators, negator, connective and interjection (§4).
Lexemes must undergo derivational procedures, either morphological or syntactic,
in order to function in a different word class.
D. Constituent order Semelai exhibits the characteristic head-dependent word
order of the languages of mainland Southeast Asia: the attributive follows the noun (1)
(§7.4); the possessor follows the possessee (2)-(3) (§7.5); the preposition precedes
the noun (3)-(4) (§8), and relative clauses follow the head (5) (§11.1). At the phrase
level, constituent order is fixed.

"In the transitive imperative clause the case of the core grammatical relations O and
IO (§§9.3.1.2-3) is not overtly coded, and it occurs, like the addressee, as a bare NP
(319). In (320) the IO is ?aji T and the O is md=bje? 'one piece'. Usually the IO of
a verb of transfer is coded by a locative preposition. Here, it resembles the
benefactive which is not overtly marked (§9.1.2.2).
(320)gi?=jia?djima=bje?!give=IMP2Ifone=CLFGive me one!

arguments, the addressee, and finally by any complements. The post-verbal NP in
the following example is ambiguous between an O and an addressee:
(321)domjrpk=cd?",[361]
"Example (115), like (114) above, illustrates clearly that the post-verbal NP is not
marking A, given that it is not co-referential with the proclitic on the verb. The postverbal NP is first person inclusive he '1&2', the proclitic is third person singular ki=

"9.2.1Core argumentsThe position of the arguments depends on the clause type. There are three basic
structures: (i) the universal clause, (ii) the perfective clause and (iii) intransitive and
non-verbal clauses.
i. The Universal Clause If the transitive clause is a universal or generic statement,
constituent order is A V O, neither A nor O is case-marked and the verb does not
host a cross-referencing proclitic (§9.3.1.1).

"While all complements, core and oblique, share the feature of being
subcategorised by the verb, one type of complement, the recipient, shares features of
the syntactic behaviour typical of core relations such as relativisation, fronting and
optionality of the case marker in certain contexts. The recipient is coded by a
locative preposition (§8.3.3), and is considered a fourth core grammatical relation
indirect object. Verbs which subcategorise for a recipient are verbs of transfer, e.g.
jon 'to give' and h?gi? 'to give'; and of verbs of oral communication, ?ur ?en 'to
instruct (s.o.)', paryeq ha? 'to inform (s.o.)'.
Recipients are similar to complements, in being semantically restricted, but also
share features typical of an oblique, most importantly the ability to make an
independent semantic contribution by encoding the spatial distinction contained in

"4.1 Introductory remarks
The majority of lexemes in Semelai can be assigned unproblematically to a
particular word class. Lexemes must undergo derivational procedures in order to
function in a different word class. Verbs generally require 'deverbalising' before
being able to function as a syntactic noun, either by morphological nominalisation:
yok —> nk-yok (NMZ-take) 'taking', or syntactic nominalisation hitam: 'to be black'
—»md=hitam (REL=be.black) 'the black one'.
Nouns undergo verbalising processes in order to function as verbs, e.g. bnih
'seed' —> b<h>nih (seed<lMPERF>) 'to sow rice seed'; baju? 'clothes' —> p-baju?
(EQUiP-clothes) 'to dress (s.o.)'. In other words, any non-prototypical function of a
lexeme will be either morphologically or syntactically marked (see Table 4.1). In
some cases there is more than one strategy available.

n?-go? 'felling'rmol 'to be male'
br-go? 'felled'go? 'to fell a tree'There is a small set of bound roots which exhibit idiosyncratic behaviour (§5.2.2).
They are associated primarily with verbal derivatives, e.g. Vyup (sleep covered)
yp-yup 'to sleep with a cover'. However, the root may also be used in conjunction
with a noun to form a nominal compound, without first being nominalised. This is
atypical for an associative phrase of this type (§7.5). Compare kayen yup (cloth
(sleep covered)) 'sleeping cover' with the compound for 'drinking water' dak
j<nh>?oh (water drink<NMZ>). Until further investigation is undertaken, it is4.1 Introductory remarks95difficult to ascertain whether these are indeed verbal roots, or if they have some sort
of precategorial status.
For the most part, the lexemes which present problems to the system in terms of
multifunctionality are loanwords from Malay, e.g. turjkDt 'stick', turjkDt 'to prop
up', where there appears to be a case of zero conversion operating between the word
classes of noun and verb. The treatment I give to such lexemes is to posit a case of
heterosemy.1 Not all loanwords behave in this manner, and many, like krja? 'to
work', need to undergo overt derivational change, e.g. krja? 'to work' —»k<n>rja?
'work, task'. In the domain of indigenous Semelai lexemes, zero conversion usually
only takes place within subclasses of a main class, e.g. transitivity shifts such as the
labile verb ph«l 'to come down, intr./to come down (s.th.), tr.', or shifts from main
verbs to supplemental verbs or adverbs, e.g. ?ayon 'to be slow' and adverbial
'slowly'.
We will now examine the general features of class membership in Semelai. The
major contrast is between open and closed word classes. Within this division, it may
be possible to further organise the membership into minor classes identifiable on the
basis of combinatorial possibilities. Not all distinctions at this level of minor
classification necessarily signal different word class membership.
An open class is distinguished by the following criteria:
a)
b)c)d)It will have a potentially unlimited number of members, and thus can be
freely added to.
It may have the potential to feed derivational processes which function
productively to augment the membership of the class to which the form
belongs, e.g. causative derivation of the verb ca 'to eat (s.th.)' —> pan-ca 'to
feed (s.th.) to (s.o.)' (§5.3.6).
It may contain subclasses which are themselves closed, e.g. the verb class
contains a subclass of eight dimension adjectives (§4.2.2). Classes which
exhibit finite membership are grouped within the open class on the basis of
primary criteria, e.g. the potential to function as the head of a verb phrase.
The members of an open class are generally free lexemes.","[122, 123]"
"11 Complex clausesIn this chapter, syntax at the level above the simple clause is examined, in other
words, sentences comprising combinations of simple clauses. Relative clauses,
where a clause modifies a noun, are discussed in §11.1. This is followed by a
discussion of complementation, where a complement clause fills a core argument
position, A, S or O, in a higher clause (§11.2). The discussion then turns to the three
constructions where a clause functions to modify a VP or a proposition: serial verb
constructions (§11.3), the concatenation of independent clauses (§11.4), and
connective clauses (§11.5).
An areal feature of South-east Asian languages is the general absence of formal
signalling to code the conjoining or embedding of clauses in complex constructions,
resulting in a low level of structural difference. For the most part, in Semelai the
various complex sentences simply consist of the unmarked paratactic and, to a lesser
extent, the hypotactic concatenation of two or more clauses. Note that although the
distinction can be difficult to establish in certain cases, there is in principle a
distinction between the simple concatenation of independent clauses (§11.4) and
serialised verb constructions (§11.3).
A note is in order on the analytic means of distinguishing the covertly combined
clauses. Decisions were made in accordance with the intuitions of the Semelai
speakers, phrase and clause level pauses, and intonation contours.","[366, 367]"

"11.5.1 General features of connectives
The clause containing the connective tends to be the initial clause. Concatenated
clauses containing connectives display one feature distinguishing them from the
concatenated clause type in §11.4 - the ability to interchange the order of clauses
where this is semantically plausible.
The connective is always the initial constituent in the clause. It is usually a single
word, although there is one phrasal temporal connective ?luc tarn (pass from)
'after'. In terms of etymology, only two categories are expressed by Semelai11.5 Connective clauses3 81morphemes: cause and condition; the majority of connectives are borrowed from
Malay.
The trend for connectives or conjunctions to be borrowed from the dominant
national language is noted for a number of languages in Thompson and Longacre
(1985: 204-5). It is not possible to comment why this is so for Semelai, other than to
note that in nearly all cases where there is a Malay form, there is no Semelai
equivalent. The absence of these overt markers is not remarkable in itself as it is an
expected areal feature. In most cases, this type of information is inferable, see §11.4.
In fact, many of the terms borrowed from Malay are in turn borrowings from other
languages, and many of these relationships can also be expressed in Malay without
the use of a conjunction, e.g. a conditional clause may be expressed either
paratactically - ada kereta dia pergi (be car he go) '(If) there is a car he will go', or
with a connective kalau ada kereta dia pergi (if be car he go) 4If there is a car he
will go'. It is also interesting to note that in the purposive clause (§11.4.1.2) for
instance, the Malay conjunctions have not been borrowed into Semelai.
There is not always a match between the form and function of the borrowed term.
There are instances where borrowings from Malay have semantic innovations in
Semelai, which as far as can be ascertained are not attested in Malay. Consider the
temporal kna? 'when' (§11.5.2.3). kena 'to affect (s.th.)' is a Malay verb, the use of
which is often associated with external imposition or adversity toward the thing
affected. The usage of kna? in (225) 4it happened that when' 7 as a connective is not
found in Malay. Likewise sampai 'until', a conjunction in Malay, functions also as a
discourse connective sampay 'so that; so, at that point' in Semelai (§11.5.3). Both
of the Malay usages of these words are attested in Semelai, kna? 'to affect (s.th.)'
(223), and sampay 'until' (224).

"9.3 Coding strategies
In this section two basic strategies for coding syntactic function will be examined in
relation to the core roles S, A, O and IO: a) cross-referencing, and b) NP-marking.
Table 9.1 summarises the marking patterns discussed in the following sections.
A, the subject of the transitive clause, is coded by the proclitic la= 'A' on all
pronouns and nouns, with the exception of inanimate nouns which are not eligible to
be an A. (Note that A is simultaneously cross-referenced on the verb; neither S nor
O are cross-referenced.) S, the subject of the intransitive clause, is unmarked except
for the third person pronominal forms, which have distinctive absolutive forms. O,
the object of a transitive clause, optionally hosts the proclitic hn= *O' across all NPs
including third person pronominals.

(§9.3.2) clause types.",[286]
"E. Morphosyntax
The syntactic typology of Semelai displays an intricate mix of
features based on a basic transitive/perfective-intransitive/imperfective contrast.
Semelai exhibits both head and dependent marking, e.g. the head-marking
pronominal proclitics on the transitive verb and the dependent-marking proclitics on
post-verbal arguments which are introduced below.
Core grammatical relations are marked by a system of clitic cross-referencing in the
transitive clause. The A is cross-referenced by a pronominal proclitic on the verb (6),
and proclitic la= 'A' on the optional post-verbal NP. A system of differential object
marking optionally encodes the object N P with proclitic h n = 'O'. The O is not
cross-referenced on the verb, see example (6).
In the intransitive clause, the subject NP does not exhibit role marking, with the
exception of the third person pronominal forms which have a fused enclitic hn 'S':
kehn '3S' (< keh=hn 3=S), dehn '3plS' (< deh=hn 3pl=S). As with O, S is not
cross-referenced on the verb, see example (9) above.
4Third person pronouns are not distinguished for gender. Rather than using the clumsy '(s)he' for
third person singular forms, they are translated throughout according to the context of the original
text.",[33]

"7.3 The quantifier phrase207the function of classifiers in Semelai is not only to individuate entities in order to
count them - this is in fact marginal given that not all entities are associated with
classifiers, and of those that are, flexibility obtains - but individuation is a means of
establishing referentiality, and providing anaphoric reference,4 see (3) and (22)
above. The numeral ma= 'one' co-occurs most frequently with the classifiers.
We will examine the borrowed classifiers first, followed by the indigenous terms.
Some examples of borrowed classifiers are listed below:
?ikur
bje?
bidarj
hlay
buku?
rntarj'animates: human, non-human'
'three dimensional objects: fruits, eggs, houses, hills, rivers'
'things that are spread out: mats, thatch'
'length of fabric, strand of hair'
'lump: earth, congealed rubber'
'oral narrative'The two most striking differences from Malay usage of these classifiers are the use
in Semelai of ?ikur to denote 'any animate entity, including people', see (26),
whereas in Malay ekor 'tail' is used only for 'animals', e.g. dog, monkey, bird, fish,
insect;5 secondly, the classifier bje? <— biji 'seed', the Malay classifier for small
round objects, is collapsed with the Malay classifer buah 'fruit*, used for objects of
indefinite size or shape, resulting in one basic classifier bje? for three dimensional
objects, see (17), (20) and (27).
In (26), the classifier follows the noun and the two numeral expressions function
anaphorically.
(26)kah,ki=khDmpon?ikur,dwa?kdor,dwa?rmolsdom3
3A=get four
CLF two
be.female two
be.male only
Him, he got four (of them), just two (who) were female, (and) two (who) were
male.
The fact that the classifiers are based on the semantics of shape allows them to be
used to express relative dimension as in the following example:
(27)ny-they
NMZ-be.big one=CLF house
(It was) the width (of) a house.","[234, 235]"
"By contrast, comparing the adjunct in the interrogative clause in (26) with (25b)

hereiv. Possessor marking Possessor marking on NPs codes the third person
possessive with the enclitic =hn '3POSS' (§7.5.1). Morphologically, only core roles
or NPs possessed by a core NP host the enclitic. The enclitic functions as an
alternative to the use of a free pronominal, and in this context occurs in free
variation with it. Possessor marking of core roles S, A, O and IO is shown in
examples (27M30).

Alternatively, the two meanings could be conflated as 'to (be) V to X's end'. This
SVC is always used in contexts where the referent is a set of individuated entities,
and is glossed here as 'exhaustively'. It is unclear whether kmorj should be treated as
a manner adverbial or an adverbial universal quantifier 'all'. In order to provide a
natural translation, it is translated as 'all', or 'every one'.

"2.2 The syllable452.2.3.2 Epenthesis
The epenthesis of vowels is best analysed as a response to violations of skeletal
structure. It is used to build acceptable syllables from degenerate or unsyllabified
sequences of consonants, which exist in the underlying representation, in accordance
with the minimality condition of syllable wellformedness. In particular, epenthesis
results from the need to meet wellformedness conditions and to build the syllable.
In order for the site of the epenthetic vowel to be correctly predicted, constraints
on the phonotactic and prosodic possibilities of the language are taken into account
(see §2.2.1 and §2.2.3). Realisation rules are not considered as separate rules, but as
an intrinsic component of a general syllabification process that holds in the
language. The domain of these rules is therefore the same as the domain of
syllabification: at the underlying level of word formation.
Sequences of consonants requiring epenthesis only occur at the left edge of a
word, where both codas and onsets can be syllabified within the sequence,
demonstrating that epenthesis is independent of the direction of syllabification.
Epenthetic vowels are defined as those which are entirely predictable and
therefore are of phonetic, not phonemic status, whereas phonemic vowels are not
predictable, and therefore must always be specified. The default vowel is [e],
however, in Semelai all oral vowels have equal access and equity to either status phonemic or phonetic (§2.3.3). A number of rules ensure the correct realisation of
the epenthetic vowels. These are stated in terms of the adjacent right-hand segment:
the non-final open syllable vowel is determined by the onset of the adjacent syllable,
and the vowel of the closed syllable is determined by the coda of the rhyme.
L The realisation of epenthetic vowels

"[CC]jx

?aq(8c) Vowels are not reduplicated in Semelai, so the empty vowel of the template is
filled according to the vowel realisation rules set out in §3.2.1.3: ?i]-?ar) 'to be
opening' is realised as [?erj-?ai)].
Although the above analysis has been chosen, alternatively, in order to illustrate the
parallel structure of the process in relation to disyllabic roots, association could take
place first in relation to the onset, given that onsets are obligatory. Infixation of the
coda would be into a structure resembling the disyllabic root, i.e. a word with a light
penultimate syllable. In fact, the ordering would not be of any significance, and
placing coda copy subsequent to onset copy would produce the same result.
Hi. Function The lack of phonological specification of coda copy is reflected in the
lack of semantic specification associated with the affix. The functions of this process
are varied, ranging from the derivation of verbs to the derivation of nouns, dependent
on the word class of the root. These are outlined below with cross-references to the
relevant sections:
a) Transitive verb to intransitive verb derivation (§5.3.1): chek 'to plant' —»
ck-chdk 'to be planting'.
b) Some verbs have a citation form which is the result of coda copy to a nonoccurring free root (§5.2.1.2): Vkhu? (vomit) -> k?-khu? 'to be vomiting';
*VkDl (rest head) —> klkol 'to lay o's head down, be lying with head resting
(on s.th.)'.
c) Noun to stative verb derivation (§5.4.1.1): tuh 'breast' —> th-tuh 'to have
breasts'.",[103]
"Semantically, each clause in this construction is an independent proposition. The
concatenated construction can convey the following range of semantic propositions:

•consecutive (§11.4.1.1)
purposive (§11.4.1.2)
conditional (§11.4.1.3)
simultaneous (§11.4.1.4)The independent clauses are simply juxtaposed in a fortuitous manner, and there is
no overt marking of the semantic relationship holding between the clauses. In the
absence of any overt markers of the relationship between the clauses, they are
ordered in relation to the logical sequence of events, i.e. chronologically - e.g. in the
conditional the antecedent must precede the consequent - and are not
interchangeable under any circumstances.
Understanding these clauses depends on pragmatic interpretation based on
knowledge of the discourse context, or specific cultural knowledge (§11.4.1).
