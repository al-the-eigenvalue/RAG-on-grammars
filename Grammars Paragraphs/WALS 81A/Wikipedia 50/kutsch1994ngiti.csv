"Zintransitive—reflexiveVERBAL MORPHOLOGYThe following are two sets of examples containing an intransitive, a transitive,
and a reflexive verb cach. First of all, they are presented in the Perfective
Present, which has SVO word order. In the second set, they are presented in
the Present Continuous, where the object precedes the nominalised verb stem,
and an auxiliary follows the subject: SAuxOV (NOM).",[244]

connected speech and in written texts, the numeral can both precede or follow
the noun it modifies, or even be found in clause-initial position, separated
from the noun altogether. The different word orders signal different degrees
of emphasis. Numeral-noun is the unmarked order with the least emphasis,

there are different processes by which nouns are derived from verbs (5.11.1).
Four morphological strategies are described, three of which are action-related.
The fourth strategy, tonally constrastive with one of the three action-related
strategies, marks the result of the action or an object related to the action,
Secondly, there is participant-noun formation (5.11.2). A distinction is madebetween participant nouns on the one hand, and agent nouns with expressed
abject. Two strategies of the former are described, and one of the latter,Finally, nominalisation processes take place in order to make the members of
a particular class of words take a nominal function in the sentence, In. thisway, modifiers, verbal modifiers, numerals, and postpositional phrases can benominalised. When nominalised, they may function in possessive constructions,
postpositional phrases, or as head of a subject or object noun phrase. All theseNounsconstituents undergo one and the same process of nominalisation, which is
described in’ 5.11.3.
§.11.1 VerbalThere are four strategies to derive non-participant nouns from verbs:

2, verb stems on a M.H tone pattern

"SinceonlythreetonalconfigurationsaretheA first division into four main classes is made on the basis of tone in themaximum differentiation found across the verb classes in the Infinitives or anyconjugated verb forms, neither Infinitive nor Imperative forms alone will
account for the division into four main classes. This means that in certainneeded.cases, two verb forms are needed to recognise the basic verb classes. The two
verb forms that most casily show the four main verb classes based on tone
are either Infinitive and Imperative singular, or Imperative singular and
Imperative plural. In this section, both are exemplified. Because verbs are
normally cited in their Infinitive form, any later reference to the determination
of verb classes will make use of the Infinitive, with the Imperative singular, ifVerb class 1 can be determined on the basis of Infinitives or Imperatives alone.
A combination of two verb forms is needed jn order to distinguish between
classes 2 and 3, which are tonally homophonous in their Infinitive and
Imperative plural forms, or between classes 3 and 4, which are tonally
homophonous in the Imperative singular.

"283Collective-and Distributive Plurality
Newman coined the term “pluractional” to refer to the set of verb stems
whose specific semantic component indicates plural action as opposed to
singular action for the base form. “Although pluractional verbs sometimes
relate to plurality of a nominal argument in the sentence (e.g subject, direct
object, even indirect object), the essential semantic characteristic of such verbs
is almost always plurality or multiplicity of the verb’s action” (Newman,
1990:53-4}.",[295]

to indicate ethnic groupings. When studying the word lists, though, it becomesevident that some of their spcech varieties are almost identical (e.g. Dja-dha’
and Ta-dha), whereas others are very distinct (Pi-dha from Dja-dha, and from
Ddra-dha and Njaw-dha), Dja-dha is the speech variety which is used for radiobroadcasts as well as for the written standard of the language. Rrkpa is
considered by the people as a subgroup of Pi, and probably points more to
an ethnic subdivision, since their speech forms are almost identical. [1 must
be said here that those Lendu speakers who have written about their own
language generally cite Bbaledha as having threc (main) dialects: Djadha,Pidha, and Tadha (Dhejju 1977:2, and Lotsove-Dirive 1981:1). Exception to
