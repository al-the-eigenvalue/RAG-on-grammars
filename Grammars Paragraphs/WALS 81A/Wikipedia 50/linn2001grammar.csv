"This section describes the basic word order for Euchee. Although the
noun phrase is free to move into many places, the word order in daily usage is
fairly constant. Changes in word order generally create a change in focus and or
for topicalization.'
The basic word order in a one-place declarative sentence is Actor (A) or
Patient (P), then Verb (V). In a two-place verb, the order is Actor (A) then
Patient (P), then Verb (V). These orders are illustrated below.
Since the participants are marked on the verb, they can be left out of
sentences.

PAST1Because the information on the participants is marked on the verbs, it also
allows the noun phrases to move. Speakers can still undenand who is doing
what to whom because that pronominal prefixes make it clear, even if the Agent
and/or Patient is not in their usual places. In the sentence below 'Sissy lovesSonny,' the pronominal agreement on the verb is sio-. This informs the hearer
that the actor is female, so 'Sissy' must be the actor (the person doing the loving,
not receiving the love). The possible word orders are shown in (2a-c). The basic
word order (APV)is given first. The examples in (2d-f) have an asterix (*)
because they are impossible word orders.

"The verb go2 is derived from k l 'to accompany' and the verbalizer z . ~' This order is a little odd for an A-P-V (SOV) language. One expects to find
the copula immediately following the verbal noun. This order is also inconsistent
with the rest of verbalization in the language. which is found after the verbalized
pan of speech.

in widespread usage.

As can be seen, The actor or patient can be behind the verb. This isususally done to emphasize the one that is remaining in front of the verb. An
example is in (3a) where the speaker was emphasizing that the man in the
pronominal pref x 'he' did not give up, rather than who he did not give up on. In
(3b), the speaker is focuing on whether or not William was visited, not that
Henry was the visiter. In (3c), the word order PAV is shown. That is because
the Yes/No question marker gives Henry a verbal reading and puts him in focus,
as seen in the gloss.

Even though noun phrases have the freedom to move when their
information is marked on the verb, Euchee is an APV word order language. This
order has far-reaching consequences on the rest of the language. One of the
consequences is that all the modifiers follow the phrase they modify (their head).
This is true of the noun phrase, where numbers and adjectives follow the noun,
as seeen in (4a-b). It is also true of the verb phrase, where mode and tense
follow the verb, as seen in (4c).

Some verbs require three participants. In three-place verbs, the patient is
not marked on the verb so it must be stated as a noun phrase, unless the hearer
already knows what the patient is. However, if they are, the order is Actor (A),
Patient (P), and the third participant Recipient (R) or Beneficiery (B), and then
the verb (V). Generally, all three participants are not stated. Again, this is
because the verb carries the information. Generally, the actor is known and not
state. The recipient/benefaciery is focused and placed before the patient. The
typical order is illustrated below.","[472, 473]"
"In addition, the affected participant can be at the end of the entire
sentence. In (74a) below, the basic word order with the affected participant in
[he effect clause is given again in order to compare it with the affectedparticipant at the end of the sentence in (74b). The causer can never be

Euchee can have discontinuous constituents. That is, a noun and its
demonstrative pronoun, as in 'this man' can be separated from each other. When
this happens, the demonstrative pronoun 'this, that, these, those' is placed after
the verb. The example in (8) gives the noun phrase constituents 'this cake'
together in (8a) and as discontinuous constituents in (8b).

"A third participant is present when the embedded effect verb requires a
patient. The word order is Causer [Aflected Patient V(Effect)] V(Cause). This
basic word order is shown in (73a). However, the embedded clause can act like
an independent clause in regards to word order. So, when the participants' rolesin the embedded clause are clear, as they are in (73b) with 'Amanda' and 'bread,'
the orders inside the embedded clause can be reversed.

When a speaker wishes or needs to make all three participants into nounphrases, the most common word orders are Actor-Patient-Recipientmeneficiary
and Actor-Recipient/Beneficiary-Patient. See Chapter 8, Section I , for possiblevariations in word order. (In 77a) below, the actor is clear because of the gender
on the actor pronominai prefix. In (77b), both the actor and recipient are female,
so the recipient noun phrase is made clear by the classifier. This is important

At first reference, or when the particpants are not otherwise known to thehearer, the speaker may state the participants in noun phrases instead just the
pronominal agreement on the verb. This is often necessary when both the actor
and the affected participant are 3d person. When both participants are given in
noun phrases, the word order is Causer [Affected V(Effect)] V(Cause). Thebrackets [ ] indicate the embedded clause. The surface order is the basic Actor
Patient order, but importantly the affected participant is in the embedded clause
with the effect verb. This is shown in (744, again with brackets [ ] around theembedded clause. The first noun phrase is always the actor, as seen in (72b).",[509]

"Speakers do not confuse the causer the affected participant because of the
ridgid clause order. The first pronominal participant is always interpreted as the
affected patient because the effect clause always comes first.
The example in (71a) below shows an effect on an inanimate object. The
effect verb daes not have 3d person inanimate agreement. In (7 1b). the
causative verb is reflexive.","[508, 509]"
"1995).
Nicklas (ca. 1995) posited a morpheme b- (admittedly a tentative form)
between the stem and the pronominal complex. This was a very promising leadin the extrication of the [+participant]prefix. However, he analyzed this
rnorphe~neas a prefix marking the beneficiary only, not a general valence
increasing prefix. Nicklas, too. placed the inanimate 3d person prefix hi- inside
the pronominal complex and not with the other 3d persons. In his analysis, the
beneficiary prefix b- contracted with the inanimate prefix hi-, creating ho-. This
form ho- is ultimately contracted with the other pronominal prefixes.
All of the previous researchers on Euchee pronouns used the structuralpositions of subject and object in their analysis. Thus. they were concerned with
structurally different types of verb: intransitive. transitive and ditransitive verbs.
Each of these verb types reflects a difference in valence, and many transitive
verbs can have intransitive readings (and vice-versa), but overall this structural
view of the language misses the fluid nature of valency in Euchee. Stuck in a
more rigid view of transitivity, the difference between the verbs (70) and (7 1 )
had escaped clear definitions.
A stative-active system does not focus on the structural positions ofsubject and object (transitive verbs). Instead, the inherent aspect defines thetype of verb (states and events) and therefore the roles of actors and patients.
Events can be activity. process, motion verbs. which only need one participant.
Or they can be events proper, whose actions are delimited by the patient.
Although these categories exist in a subject/object language, the change in
category is often accompanied by a change in verb. The [+participant]valence
prefix changes activities into event, and two-place events into three-place events.",[201]

This fully developed system of dependent marking is not regularly used
today. To speakers who do not use the small clause markers, dependency is
determined by a rigid word order. Then, the embedded complement clause
always precedes the main clause.",[517]

As mentioned above, the 3d penon prefixes are outside of the I"" and 2nd
prefixes, yet when the 3rdperson is a patient, the prefix order on the verb is not
affected. However, whenever there is a 3""1person actor, the linear prefix order
shows is affected. Instead of the Patient-Actor order, the 3d actor comes before
the Is' and 2"" patient prefixes, creating an Actor-Patient prefix order. The
difference in the linear order of the prefixes can be seen by comparing (35a) and
(35b) below. The example in (35a) shows a 3d person patient; it is the same as
(35c) above. The example in (3%) shows the 3d person actor: Since there is
only one place for the 31d person on the Euchee verb, there can never be two 3rd
person pronominal prefixes on any verb. When both the actor and the patient
are 3rdperson, it is always the actor prefix which is on the verb. as is shown in
(35~).","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

The basic order of the pronominal prefixes on the verb is Patient-ActorVerb Stem. or P-A-V. This means that the patient pronominal prefix is the first
prefix. and the actor pronominal prefix is inside, closer to the verb stem.
The 3rd person pronominals are structurally in a different place from the
1"" and lnd
person prefixes. They are located before the patient and actorsequence. S e e Section 5.3 below for discussion about the location of the 3""
person. However, this structural difference does not always affect the linear
order of the prefixes. So, when a 3rd person is the patient. and the actor is a I""or 2"" person, the placement of the 3d person outside of the rest is notnoticeable. The order of the pronominals is still P-A-V. This is seen in (29)

Ann Arbor, MI 48106-1346The Euchee language is an American Indian language isolate. It is the
language of the Euchee people, who originally lived in the North American
Southeast and now live in the state of Oklahoma. This is the first comprehensive
grammar of their language. It includes a description of the phonology, the
morphology. and the syntax. The data is presented so that it is immediately
accessible to linguists of any theoretical persuasion. The presentation should also
make the information accessible to lay readers, in particular to interested
members of the Euchee Tribe. It is written in the proposed Euchee orthography.
The data used for this grammar were gathered primarily through elicitation of-grammatical fonns and texts with native speakers.
Euchee has a large inventory of sounds. There are 38 consonants and I I
vowels. The consonants include a series of glottalized stops, fricatives, and
resonants. The vowels include nasal contrasts. The syllable structure is a fairly
rigid CV, but the phonology is distinguished by contraction of syllables. There
are two major dialects of Euchee today.
Euchee is largely a polysynthetic language. However, the morphemes are
not as bound as formerly thought. Instead, many affixes are independent
panicles which cliticize to their host in unstressed contexts. Euchee recognizes
four main parts of speech. the noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. However. the
formal criteria for ihese are difficultto establish. Euchee has basic SOV word
order and is head-marking, and so the morphology is largely made up of suffixes
and post-clitics. The exception is pronominal agreement. which are all prefixes
on noun and verbs. Particles, including postpositions, follow the head.","[6, 7]"

Wagner (1934:328-330) noted that some verbs could have pronominalagreement from either the di- actor sel or the do- actor set, He described the
difference between the di- two-place (transitive)verbs and the do- (transitive)
verbs in terms of specificity: The di- set by-and-large requires a general object
and the do- set by-and-large requires a specific object.
Ballard (Ballard 1978) 169-184 states that the di- actor set is generally
transitive ierbs and the do- actor set is generally transitive verbs and verbs
whose object is someone else's possession (p. 173). In his analysis, di- is derived
from Id/ fused with hi-,an inanimate, unpossessed object. Likewise. do- is
created from Id-/ and ho-, a benefative or possessed object (p. 182). (The
underlying /d/ differs from /dz/ in focus, where the /dl verbs focus on the object
and /dz/ verbs focus on the subject.) However, this analysis relies on the
morphemes /ti- and /lo- being between the actor prefixes and the verb stem. This
is contrary to the analysis in Section 4.3 above. where hi- and ho- are inanimate
and are in the same position as the other 3rdpersons, that is, outside of both the
actor and patient positions. Importantly, however, Ballard's analysis shifted thediscussion towards the benefactive, which was taken up by Nicklas (1994a; ca.","[199, 200, 201]"

Another type of equative relationship points out a person. In English, the

'Did he ask you?' (women's speech)The result is that the Euchee verb is not as synthetic as was previously
assumed. The verb stem has the pronominal and valence prefixes and only afew aspect suffixes. All other aspect, tense, and mode are independent particles
following the verb.
There are several problems in determining the linear order of tense,
global aspect and mode particles. First, they are at the end of utterances and
undergo phonological reductions. Some are dropped or are contracted with the
auxiliary stems; the vowels reduce to t'([A] or [a]) and voicing distinctions are
faint, causing distinctions between panicles to blur or be lost altogether without
more historical re-creation. Second, some of the panicles can be combined in
different orders to create subtle nuances in mood and aspect. Third. some mode
particles are resistant to placement tests (the Yes/ No question particle and the
past tense) due to their meanings. These are usually put with the other mode
particles until a more definitive placement is found. Finally, some of the
information is carried by mode in Euchee is elusive to speakers. They are best
understood in context, and so there needs to be more analysis of texts.","[291, 292]"
"These two distances are represented by three morphemes. Ne and 'a correspond
to the English 'this' and 'that' respectively. The third morpheme, -le, can be
interpreted as either 'this' or 'that'. Speakers of the Bigpond Dialect do not use
'a; instead, -le has the sole meaning Lhat'. Aii iinguisis who i~avt:wuriizd ors dielanguage record only two distances. Therefore, it is not likely that be
represented a third intermediate distance, or that 'a was a further distance such
as 'that, way over there,' in recent history.
Ne, 'a and -1e are must have the appropriate class post-clitic to refer to asingular noun or the appropriate plural post-clitic to refer to plural nouns. As the
definite suffixes on the noun often carry the same weight as the demonstratives.
the use of a demonstrative has a clear pointing out, pointing to its location, or
contrastive feeling. These same bound stems are used in the formation of place
deixis 'here, there.'
The demonstrative adjectives are placed before the noun they modify.
Euchee is basically a head-first language; that is, modification tends to be after
the noun. However, the demonstrative-noun word order appears to be an areal
feature of the Southeast, showing up in all the southeastern languages with the
exception of Choctaw and Chickasaw. The class or plural post-clitic on the
demonstrative adjectives must agree with the class assigned to the noun.

"4. MODEAUXILIARY VERBS: ABILITY, NECESSITY, AND PROBABIITY
Languages can mark mode. which has three main functions. Mode refers
to the speaker's attitudes towards the situation. Mode also show what we want
to do through language. Finally, mode can reflect the knowledge we have about
the situation. Euchee uses mode markers to express all of the functions.
Three modes--ability, necessity and probability--are expressed with
auxiliary verbs. An auxiliary verb follows the main verb. It is unlike a main
verb in that it does not have pronominal agreement. When there is no auxiliary
verb, the main verb stem carries the aspect suffix, and then past tense and
perfective (global) aspect may follow the verb. This can be seen in the order
given in (a) in Figure 5.1. However, if a mode auxiliary is used. then the
auxiliary nllrsr carry the aspect for the verb, as seen in (b) in Figure 5.1. The
tenselperfectivity panicles follow the mode auxiliaries.","[312, 313]"
"The orthography used here was developed in the mid-1990's by the
Euchee Language Class of Sapulpa. It is essentially phonemic, meaning there is
one symbol (or combination) for every distinctive sound. Because of this, it is
well-suited for representing the underlying forms and most surface forms.
Therefore, it is used throughout this work for all phonemic representations.
When surface phonetic forms are not available in the orthography, standard
Americanist phonetic symbols are used. In the phonetic forms, the nasal hook
(q) is used instead of the orthographic tilde (5) in order to use the space over thevowels for stress and pitch information. See Section 5 in Chapter 1 for a history
of this writing system, and Appendix I1 for a Pronunciation Guide based on
English equivalents.","[56, 57]"
"' The word for blujay ts'e is probably onomatopoeic.
The meaning 'human' is for the most part 'Euchee,' although the meaning has
expanded in recent times. Gatschet recorded it as explicitly Euchee, but
speakers today insist on gor'e being all humans, not just Euchees. The possessive
pronominal we- versus go- on body parts definitely divides Euchee body parts
from non-Euchee human body parts, and the pronorninals we- versus go- in
deverbal nouns also distinguish Euchee from non-Euchee human activities.
There is no word *wet2 meaning non-Euchee human, implying that hurnaness
was restricted to Euchees. This is not an uncommon separation in languages.
On the other hand, the human marker is used to describe non-Euchees for the
names of races and some other Tribes:

WP'~human-red

'African, African-Americans'
'Caucasians'
'Creek'This is the expected order in an APV (SOV)language. However, the head in
the left position runs contrary (Williams and DiSciullo 1987), who argued that
compound heads are universally the right stem. On a descriptive level, this is
not upheld with quick perusal of grammars of most Native (SOV)languages.
However. Williams and DiSciullo argue on theoretical grounds that the heads of
all words are the right-most element, including derivational suffixes. Thus, the
nominalizer (derivation) could be the head in Euchee. The nominalizer -ne is the
same as the habitual aspect -ne on verbs (inflection). Noun and verb stems, as
argued in the text, have little distinction. If they are indeed simply [+stem]
underlyingly, and not specified for noun or verb, then the -ne is for all stems.
The habitual suffix gives the verb a non-event reading, and non-events can be
used in the syntax a s norninals. Although the habitual is integrated more fully
into the noun stem (it gets the primary stress for the noun) than on the noun (it is
unstressed), it is still an inflectional affix. Thus, the heads in Euchee can still be
argued to be the left stem, contrary to the universal right-head hypothesis.

"'Help me!' ('Quickly, I'm in trouble!')

for a mother to express 'intend to' or be polite when getting her child out of bed.
Polite commands with intentive post-clitic -nb are used a t the Ceremonial
Grounds in the pre-dance Calls and during dances to encourage people to come
out and dance. They are also used in public gathering to call people to the table.
Some of these are given below in ( I I). The 1"" plural inclusive pronoun is used

"Gender-and AnimacyNicklas (1994a) gives an historical explanation for the 3rd person
pronominal prefixes being on the outer layer of the pronominal complex. He
states that they are 'relatively new based on their position.' There is reason to
believe that this can not explain the placement of the 3rd person. Irregular verb
forms are generally considered to be relics of older fonns in a language, and as
such they are often used in the recreation of historical forms. The irregular
pronominals in Euchee are given in Section 8 below, and the irregular stems in
Chapter 4, Section I .4. The irregular pronominal prefixes and the related
irregular stems give an indication of the 3d person prefix placement through
time. The irregularity in both sets is due to the pronominal prefixes having fused
with the stem. This irregularity is only found in the 1"" and 2"" singular forms. Ifthe 3rd person had been with the Is' and zndperson actor and patient agreement.
it is reasonable to assume that they would have contracted and eventually fused,too. The fact that they did not indicates that the 3rd person has been outside of
the other agreement for a long time, or at least as long as the irregular verbs.
Another explanation for the placement of the 3"" person pronomirnal
prefixes can be due to animacy requirements in the language. As shown above.
Euchee has a stative-active system of pronominal agreement. This differs from a
nominative-accusative system, where the roles (subject and object) are markedby their structural postion. However, in a stative-active system, the roles aredetermined by the inherent aspect of the verb. What is crucial here is that the
all active verbs--by far the majority of verbal expression in the language--require
an actor, and the prototypical actor must be able to initiate or control an action.
In other words, the actor must be animate. Animacy seems to be a motivating
feature in Euchee. For example, the actor pronominal prefix is closest to the
verb stem,"" and it is the role that is required on the verb when both the actor
and the patient are 3rdperson. In addition, the inanimate 3rdperson is not able to
initiate action and is thus barred from participating as an actor.
I"" and 2"" persons are clearly animate, immediate, and able to be actors.","[197, 198]"

"The 3rd person may also refer to a thing 'it.' The 1"" and 2"" persons are
participating directly in the conversation or speech act, but the 3' person is not.
and so is often a called the 'non-speech act participant.' When listing pronouns
and verb fonns. the I 51 , 7nd

II )Person1 di- '1'
2 be-'you'3 he-'he'

iIn addition to person, the pronouns mark for number. In Euchee. the
distinction is made between singutar (one). such as '1' and plural (two or more).
such as 'we.' When giving verbs and their pronominals, the plural is presentedacross from the singular.",[143]
"Instead, recipients and beneficiaries use a patient pronominal. In order to show
that they are not patients, but a third participant, recipients and beneficiaries are
marked with the [+participant], the dzo- patient [+participant] set of pronominals.
The patient is left unmarked on the verb. It is forced to appear as an
independent noun phrase. In (74a-b) below, the patient [+participant] d:o- is
used for the recipient and beneficiary. In (74c), the patient + participant case is
not shown because the recipients are the 3""' person, but it shows how the patient
object may be stated as a noun phrase or left out of the sentence.

"Location o f the 3'"" PersonThe order of the pronominal prefixes is described above. In rhe
description. the 3d person actor and patient pronominal prefixes are found
preceding the I"" and 2"" person pronominal prefixes. To put it another way, the
1"" and 2"" ppcnominals are closest to the verb, and they are organized by role:the Patient role precedes the Actor role.
The 3d person, both the 3rd actor and the 3d patient. is outside of
actor-patient asreement system. Clearly. the 3"" person Actor is outside of the I""
and 2"" person because of the shift in role order seen on the verb when the actor
is the 3N person. There is evidence t h i ~ tthe 3rd person patient is outside of the
actor-patient system as well. If the 3rd person patient is with the other patientprefixes, one would expect the 3d person to have the patient marker dze-, which
it does not. Therefore, it can be assumed that the 3rd person patient is where itcan not get the patient role marking.I9
There is still some question as to whether there are one or two 3rd person
positions (one postion for the 3d Actor and one for the 3* patient)."" Since there
can only be one 3"" penon pronominal on the verb at one time. one position is
descriptively accurate. This fact can not be easily explained with two positions.","[196, 197]"
""" Travis (1994), Rice (2000). and Bybee (1985) among others, have suggestedthat the functional phrases closest to the verb stem are the most immediate in the
interpretation of arguments.
?' The 3rd 'person' may in fact be unspecified for person features (Benveniste
1956; Noyer 1997; Ritter and Rosen to appear). Only I"" and 2"" persons have
features for [+person]and [+number]. As a non-person, 3rd can not be animate.
Euchee provides evidence for this proposal.
'3 The animacy hierarchy in Euchee also provides evidence for a separate gender
phrase. or a functional projection GenP (Linn 1998; Linn and Rosen, in progress).
This means that the traditionally accepted bundle of features in the Spec of AgrS
and AgrO would not include gender.
In addition, the contractions with the stem 4u confused the issue.
As in English, the sentence 'I bought it for him' in Euchee is ambiguous
between the two readings, 'the gift is for him' or 'I did the errand for him'
'""aker
(1996: 192-198) notes that in polysynthetic languages, the recipient or
bene faciary (his 'goal') of three-place verbs has patient (his 'theme') agreement.
However, in Mohawk, the patient is required to be inanimate ('neuter'). This is
not a requirement in Euchee. as can be seen in example (78) of the text, where
the patient is the baby.
"" This analysis is due to the fact that the location 'a reappears on the 3r* person
patients. These must be given as independent noun phrases. When the patient
of a three-place verb is a demonstrative noun, it is almost exclusively given with
'a plus the appropriate animate noun class instead of the more common -1r and
'to give'
noun class. The 'a demonstratives are seen in the example verb (go)\r*i
in the text. The -1e demonstratives are use with all to-place verbs. The location
'a is further away than -le, which makes sense as action of an three-place event
exends away to another person.
A possible explanation for this prefix order precedes from the analysis in
endnote 26. If it is true that the actors dropped off as in the 'aso- '112' irregular
pronouns, perhaps given in independent pronouns, then they may have been
reinsened at a later time. Instead of comin in between the fused recipient or
benefactive pronominal and the stem, they may have attached to the beginning
of the proniminal complex, creating the irreguiar order.
The verb hi 'take' can not be used for *canyT
or 'bring.' The verbs (golk'atltla
'to go with' or 'to cany' and (gojk'agd 'to come with' or 'to bring' are used instead.
Both contain the accompaniment prefix ka- 'with.' Therefore, the third
participant of h5 'take' is a source 'kom someone.' Apparently, the source
participant in hi 'take' is treated like a recipient or beneficiary and not like other
sources. which are clause construction (see example 93) in the text). This is
probably because the source may be human, and when it is human. the person is
highly affected. The same analysis holds for (go)& 'to receive (from).'","[234, 235]"

'Wagner (1934) did not state how he determined suffixes from clitics. Tense
and modes are suffixes (pp. 351-352, and pp. 353-355, respectively).
The consequence is that tense and mode are treated as separate from the verb
hrase in Euchee.
'It is probable that the future nasal is n contraction of the inchoative port-clitic
2 with the stem. This is normal contraction in Euchee (see Chapter 2, Section
4.1 Contraction). The immediate future fits semantically with the inchoative. In
addition, the tense particles are grammaticalized from auxiliary verbs of position
(Linn in prep). Sitting ci became the past imperfective j5. Standing fa became
the present, as in 'akeFB That's the way it is.' It is also used in the past
perfective jzfa. The lying 'e would fit nicely into this pattern of
grammaticalization, with '2 having the progressive and immediate future reading.

Crawford was treating ie as an aspect suffix 'duration' (rough notes). I reject
this on the grounds of stress. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of a stem.
So, for example, the habitual aspect suffix -ne gets primary stress on verbs, and
when it acts as the norninalizer for verbs, it still gets primary stress on the end of
the noun. If le were an aspect suffix like -ne, we would expect this same
behavior, but is the last syllable, it should have primary stress. But, as stated in
the text. it is not stressed.
In addition, the habitual -ne can be used on a11 verbs and verbal
structures. but as a verbalizer le can not be attached to existing verbs. Since
adjectives always have a verbalizer, it raises the question as to whether the
adjective is underlying a verb, and that le is durative aspect and T is progressive
aspect on the verb, However, without le or '2, adejctives can not function as a
verb. No such morphology is needed for other verbs (including stative verbs). In
addition. le cannot be added to active verbs in order to get a reading of say. 'She
lived for a iong rime.' or 'He smoked cigarettes d~tringhis liferime.' Therefore, le
is considered to be a cliticized verbalizer and not an aspect suffix.
The verbalizer -lc is possibly related to direction ciitic -kc, meaning
'movement along or down a long object'. Other location clitics are used as
aspect. For exampie, on nouns -1e (a homonym with -1e 'movement along or
down a long object') is the direction 'back to,' and on verbs it is the repeated
aspect. The distant location -ke indicates heard action verbs. The meaning of
*alongan object' could be interpreted as 'a long time, over a long period of time.'
However, this interpretation seems more likely under the 'duration' affix
hypothesis of le, This is because it is not clear why le would get a 'verbalize'
reading on some nouns but a 'direction' reading others. This can be explained if
adjectives are underlying different from nouns or verbs.","[344, 345, 346]"
"In the majority of nominalizations, the suffix -ne is accompanied by the
impersonal go- 'one' pronominal on the verb. Wagner gives go- as the infinitive
form of the verb and states nominalization in terms of the infinitive form.
However. this is not the infinitive, but an impersonal form (see Chapter 3.
Section 2). All verbs can use the impersonal 3""1 person pronominal go-, meaning
'one' and often translated as a generic 'you.' Additional evidence that
nominalization occurs on inflected verbs and not the infinitive is that deverbalnominals also occur with 3""' person pronouns other than go- and with no pronoun
in cases where the subject is inanimate. Therefore, any verb inflected in the 3d
person can be nominalized, although the majority of nominalizations occur with
the impersonal pronoun go-.
