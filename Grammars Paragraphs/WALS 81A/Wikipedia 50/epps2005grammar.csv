In the transitive clause, the basic order of nominal arguments (where these are
explicitly stated at all) is difficult to ascertain definitively. In cases where there are
absolutely no other clues to the identity of subject and object, Hup speakers prefer AOV
constituent order, which suggests that this order is in some sense the most basic:(9)a)m’Q‡hya/ám mQ¤h-Q¤ysnakejaguarkill-DYNM‘The snake kills the jaguar.’
b)ya/ám m’Q‡hmQ¤h-Q¤yjaguarkill-DYNMsnake‘The jaguar kills the snake.’ (EL)
It is, however, extremely rare for constituent order to be the only clue to the identity of
subject and object in a transitive clause, even in elicitation contexts. Grammatical objects
that are human entities, pronouns, and NPs involving demonstratives are obligatorily
marked with Object case in Hup (see §4.3.1.1), so their identity as subject or object is
always clear. On the other hand, inanimate entities in object function are not generally
object-marked; yet inanimate entities can hardly ever be interpreted as agents, hence
hardly ever as subjects, so this lack of object marking rarely leads to confusion. Cases of
potential ambiguity are therefore for the most part limited to interactions between two
animal entities, for which object marking is optional. Even in these cases, if context-910related clues to the identity of the participants are inadequate or lacking, speakers
prefer to use the optional case markers rather than simply to rely on constituent order.
Actual Hup discourse provides few clues to establishing one order of core
nominal arguments as more ‘basic’ than another, because clauses containing both a full
(non-pronominal) nominal subject and object are extremely rare. When these do occur,
the order of subject and object is flexible, and is subject to pragmatic considerations—in
general, newer or more focused information is fronted, while more topical constituents
tend to come later in the clause. However, a text count of such clauses does suggest that
AOV order is at least twice as common as OAV order, which supports the apparent
preference for AOV order found in elicitation contexts, as discussed above. A text
example of AOV order is given in (10); the alternative OAV order (in which the speaker
is focusing on the object, Curupira) in (11).","[925, 926, 927]"
"90517.3.1. Constituent order in the declarative clause
Constituent order in Hup is relatively free, but the formally least-marked pattern is clearly
verb-final. Defining the order of nominal arguments in the transitive clause is more
difficult, but the ‘basic’ constituent order can arguably be identified as AOV. The actual
order of all constituents appears to be determined primarily by pragmatics, with the most
important parameter being the fronting of new information. Other relevant factors that
correlate with word order are verbal tense and aspect, and the identity of nominal
constituents as pronouns or full lexical nouns. Both context and the existence of
morphological core case-marking (see §4.3.1), which corresponds to a consistently
nominative-accusative alignment system, help to disambiguate syntactic arguments.
The dropping of arguments is common in Hup when they can be recovered from
the discourse context; this is particularly true for objects (example 1). Subject dropping
also occurs (example 2), but is less frequent. In general, Hup speakers seem to prefer
clauses with only one full nominal (i.e. non-pronominal) argument, and will sometimes
even repeat the clause, dropping an argument each time, in order to conform to this
(example 3). In providing information in response to a question or related solicitation
from an interlocutor, an utterance may consist of only a verb (plus inflection), or only a
noun or adjective, but in most other discourse contexts a predicate with at least one
nominal argument (usually the subject) is the norm.","[921, 922]"

The order of constituents in ditransitive clauses follows similar guidelines to that
in transitive clauses. The dropping of one or even both objects from the clause is quite
common, since the participants can usually be recovered from the discourse context.
When both objects are present, their order is governed mainly by pragmatics. Their
respective identities are usually not in question, since recipients/beneficiaries are more
likely to be human or at least animate (and receive differential object marking), while
direct objects tend to be inanimate. However, even if both objects are human—leading to
potential ambiguity between object and recipient/beneficiary—their order is quite flexible
and is determined by pragmatics and context. For example, consultants interpret both of916the elicited options in (26) to mean ‘I show you the child’, since this is the more
pragmatically expected scenario:
(26) a) tˆh=dó/-a‡n /ám-a‡n /ãh bé-éyb) /ám-a‡n tˆh=dó/-a‡n /ãh bé-éy3sg=child-OBJ 2sg-OBJ 1sg show-DYNM2sg-OBJ 3sg=child-OBJ 1sg show-DYNM‘I show you the child’ (EL)
Where a ditransitive clause involves a causitivized transitive verb, there seems to be some
preference (in elicitation contexts) for the object of the main predicate to precede the
object of the embedded transitive, but consultants judge both interpretations to be
acceptable:(27)tã/ãêytˆh=dó/-a‡npáti-a‡nkey-yQ‚êh-Q‚êywoman3sg=child-OBJ Pattie-OBJ see-request-DYNM‘The woman tells the child to look at Pattie.’
(Or: ‘The woman tells Pattie to look at the child’) (EL)
In actual discourse, however—in these cases where both ditransitive objects are
actually present—their respective order is highly interchangeable. This is particularly
apparent in example (28), where the speaker switches the order of the object nominals
(‘drink’ and ‘him’) between repetitions of the same clause:(28)/´‡gtˆ¤h-a‡nt ˆhg’çp-çh,b’ç‡/po‡g-ót!drink3sg-OBJ3sgserve-DECLcuiabig-OBL‘She served drink to him, in a big cuia!

Further examples of the flexible ordering of ditransitive objects are given in (29-32); in
general, newer, more focused information precedes older, more topical information. In917(29-30), the recipient or indirect object precedes the direct object (as it also does in 31
below):(29)‘máy!teghç‚=/ãêy-a‡ndadánya /ˆnlet’s.go Non.Indian=FEM-OBJ orange1pldu-wQd-/áy-ay-áh

In (31-32), the direct object precedes the recipient or indirect object:
(31)/amˆ‡hkág’2sg.POSS forehead/a‡nbe-kQ‡m!1sg.OBJshow-IMP2‘Show me your forehead!’ (M.NS.65)
(32)yúp=mahyawa‡çthat.ITG=REPTiti.Monkey forehead=REP spirit-OBJkág’=mahba/tˆ‡b-a‡n tˆh bé-éh
3sgshow-DECL‘So he showed the monkey’s forehead to the spirit.’ (M.NS.66)
Note that pronominal subjects in these clauses tend to immediately precede the verb, just
as they do in mono-transitive clauses; non-pronominal subjects, on the other hand—while
infrequent—are more likely to be clause-initial (supporting the argument that basic
constituent order is AOV):(33)tˆh=tQ‚h/íntˆ¤h-a‡nwQ‡d3sg=child.mother 3sg-OBJ foodnç¤/-ay-áh
give-INCH-DECL‘His wife gave him food’ (P.CC.85)
Finally, objects of ditransitive clauses may be tacked on behind the predicate as
external arguments (example 34), just as in mono-transitive clauses. In the very rare
cases in which a clause has more than three explicitly stated arguments (i.e. a tritransitive
applicative construction), then at least one argument (usually the beneficiary of the
applicative) occurs in this external or clause-final position.","[932, 933, 934]"

The functional and historical motivations for this Verb-Subject constituent order
variant in the declarative clause may be several. Fronting the verb in relation to the
subject places focus on the event itself; this is consistent with the verb’s typical aspectual
value in such cases (usually Dynamic; i.e. action in progress or otherwise relevant to the
speech moment), and with the fact that the pronominal subject is relatively given
information. That this constituent order strategy reflects the information structure of the
clause is supported by the fact that subjects which are full nominals are more likely to be
clause-initial (example 6). Subject-final order also makes it possible both for the clause
to receive Declarative marking and for the verb to be marked with the Dynamic marker
or some other Boundary Suffix (which otherwise cannot co-occur with the Declarative on
the verb), such as Negative -nˆ¤h.",[924]
"(6)wç‡hpQcQ¤w=d’´h b’ˆ¤yˆ/river.indian youth=PLonlyní-íy
be-DYNM‘There are only River Indian boys.’ (B.Cv.131)908It is important to note that while this subject-final constituent order strategy is
typical in Hup discourse when expressing events in progress, it also has a parallel in the
general information-packaging conventions of Hup, whereby arguments are often
expressed (or re-stated) as external arguments to the main clause, following the predicate
in little appositional packages which are independently marked with the Declarative
suffix (while the preceding clausal material may also take the Declarative marker; see
below). The predicate-final subjects in examples such as (4-5) should probably not be
considered as external to the main clause, however; they are not co-referential with any
other subject nominal in the clause, and Declarative marking on the verbal predicate in
these cases is not grammatical, suggesting that the predicate is understood to be really
clause-internal.
Verb-final constituent order is the norm when clauses encode events that are not
currently in progress or otherwise concurrent with the temporal frame of reference.
These correspond to a range of discourse types; they are standard in past-tense narrative
and in descriptive and other time-neutral discourse, and are also common in clauses with
future or past tense reference generally. In these cases, the clause-final verb is very often
marked with the Declarative marker -Vêh (§17.3.2 below), but a variety of other Boundary
Suffixes also occur (e.g. Future -tég, Negative -nˆ¤h, etc.).
Declarative verb-final constituent order is illustrated in the intransitive clauses in
(7-8). As these examples show, intransitive (and also transitive) clauses are frequently
initiated by an adverbial word or clause (often denoting temporal sequence), followed by
the subject, and finally the verb.","[924, 925]"
"3616. The noun phrase: modification and definiteness
This chapter deals with issues relating to the noun phrase and its behavior within
the clause, with a particular focus on modification and definiteness. While chapter 5
dealt with the compound noun, an NP composed of two (or more) associated members of
the open class of nouns, this chapter examines the closed classes of nominal modifiers—
demonstratives, quantifiers, and adjectives—and their roles within the NP. In addition, it
addresses the ability of members of closed word classes to act as nominal heads in their
own right, occurring in lieu of a noun or noun phrase as the argument of a verb. A few
additional non-nominal functions (adverbial, determiner, etc.) of these closed word
classes (specifically interrogative pronouns and demonstratives) are briefly considered
here as well. In the final section of this chapter, I also briefly introduce NP coordination.
Locative postpositions, which typically combine with a noun to form an adverbial phrase
within the clause, are not discussed here but in §10.2.3.
A basic phrase structure template for the NP (in which the noun stem N may be
either compound or simple) is provided here. The order of the constituents is fairly rigid
within the NP itself; when numerals, demonstratives, or possessors follow the noun, they
are probably best interpreted as appositional NPs in their own right, or even as predicate
nominals.
NP Æ (Dem—POSS PN—Numeral) N (Adj)3626.1. Pronouns
While the form of the Hup personal pronouns and their inflected variants are covered in
§4.1.2 (and §5.2), the present discussion deals briefly with their syntax—that is, their
ability to represent NPs in the clause. A discussion of the differences in clausal
constituent order between pronouns and full NPs relative to the verb is given in §17.3.1.
The subject pronouns are here re-summarized in Table 6.1. As can be seen in the
more detailed paradigm given in Table 4.1, §4.1.2, Hup pronouns—like nouns in
general—take basic inflectional and derivational forms relating to case, number, and
possession, as well as various bound focus and discourse-marking forms (chapter 7).
With the exception of suppletive forms (formed via phonological reduction) for the first
person singular object (/a‡n) and possessive (nˆ‡) pronouns, inflected pronouns are
essentially regular.","[377, 378, 379]"

Constituent order in these examples is fairly free, as it is generally in Hup (see
§17.3.1), and the respective roles of participants would under normal circumstances be
largely recoverable from the discourse context. In elicitation, however, the general
pattern seems to be that the least prototypically ‘core’ participant is clause-final,
following the verb. This pattern can be avoided without ambiguity in (21), where the
directional verb form makes it clear that the speaker cannot be the recipient, but only the
beneficiary. The identity of the -a‡n-marked nominal as direct object vs. recipient seems
to be primarily dependent on pragmatics, rather than word order, with consultants
maintaining that the interpretation of ‘show the child to X’ was the same whether the
word order was Recipient-Object or vice versa, and preferring a more complex series of
clauses to communicate ‘show X to the child’.","[245, 246]"

While verb-final constituent order is basic in Hup, an alternative order, in which
the verb precedes the subject in the declarative clause, is also in use. This order is often
favored when the clause encodes an ongoing or currently relevant event, and particularly
when the subject is a pronoun; these clauses are therefore common in everyday
conversation, but quite infrequent in narrative and other types of discourse. In such
cases, the verb is usually marked with the Dynamic suffix -Vêy, but other Boundary
Suffixes are possible (e.g. Inchoative -ay, Negative -nˆ¤h, etc.).
A crucial feature of clause-final subjects in declarative clauses is their inability to
stand by themselves without additional morphology—a feature that sets apart this VS
constituent order as clearly more marked than the more neutral verb-final order (in
addition to the fact that the clause-final subject is frequently a pronoun). In this context,
subjects are obligatorily marked by an inflectional suffix, most often the Declarative -Vêh
(§17.3.2 below), but other markers are also possible. If an unmarked subject does occur
in clause-final position, the clause can only be interpreted as a polar interrogative (see
§17.4.2 below). Third person pronouns in post-verbal position are typically the907‘intangible’ demonstrative variants (yu), rather than the regular personal pronominal
forms (cf. §6.3).
Examples of this clause type are given in (4-5).","[922, 923, 924]"
"3Other features of Hup grammar include a basically verb-final constituent order;
this is best characterized as AOV, although the relative order of A and O is highly
flexible. In addition, Hup has developed a complex evidentiality system (with five
distinctions) and an incipient system of noun classification; these features also fit the
regional profile, and their development in Hup has probably been motivated by contact
with Tukano. Finally, an intriguing aspect of Hup grammar is the significant and even
exuberant polyfunctionality of many morphemes, which in most cases reflects traceable
historical processes of grammaticalization.
A number of aspects of Hup grammar are typologically unusual, as well as
intriguing from an areal perspective. These include the treatment of possessed body parts
(animal body parts are inalienably possessed, while human body parts are alienable; see
§5.4.5), word order inversion patterns in question formation (see §17.4), the
polyfunctionality of many morphemes (e.g. §3.3), and several unusual paths of
grammaticalization that create such unique historical links as between the noun ‘stick,
tree’ and a verbal future suffix (§13.1), and between an evidential and a nominal marker
indicating a deceased referent (§14.9.3). Other features, such as the heavy effects of areal
diffusion on Hup grammar (but much less on its lexicon) are also interesting from both a
cross-linguistic and a regional point of view. Hup is a good illustration of the value of
research on little-known and endangered languages, which can provide us with new ways
of thinking about languages in general.","[19, 20]"

This interrogative subtype solicits a yes/no answer, and is formally quite different
from the content questions. It does not involve a question word, and constituent order is
subject-final rather than verb-final; moreover, this clause-final subject can only be a
pronoun (a fact that is consistent with the de-focused subject in this interrogative clause
type). Also—presumably because there is no clause-final verb—the Interrogative
Boundary Suffix -V/ is not present in this type of question. Crucially, it is the obligatory
lack of the Declarative marker on the subject that defines the clause as an interrogative
rather than a subject-final declarative (see §17.3.1). The clause-medial verb must take a
Boundary Suffix other than Declarative -Vêh or Interrogative -V/, such as the Dynamic,
Future, Negative, or Inchoative. Direct objects usually occur clause-initially; other
objects may either precede the verb or follow it as a tacked-on external argument.
Intonation in polar questions tends to be relatively high throughout the clause
(compared to declarative and other Hup clause types); it is fairly level, but falls slightly at
the end of the clause (as does intonation on constituent questions). The fact that Hup
polar questions in general have a relatively higher intonation than declarative clauses is a
typologically common pattern; even the placement of the higher intonation at the
beginning of the clause rather than at the end is typologically not unusual (cf. Siemund
2001: 1013).","[961, 962]"

As is common in many languages, pronominal subjects in Hup (which tend to be
highly topical) almost always immediately precede the verb in the clause (examples 1415) (resulting in a default OAV order). Because pronominal objects are obligatorily
case-marked, ambiguity in the identity of core syntactic arguments is always avoided
when one argument is a pronoun. Probably as a result of this preference for pronominal
subjects to directly precede the verb, they have acquired some of the characteristics of
proclitics when in this position in the clause (i.e. lack of stress, and a tendency for the
third person singular pronoun tˆh to be phonologically dependent on the verb in the
Umari Norte dialect; see §3.4.2.1 and §6.1).",[928]

Perhaps the most frequent use of polar questions is the standard Hup greeting,
which involves asking a question about whatever the addressee is obviously engaged in at
the time. These questions are clearly not really requests for information—the formula
virtually requires the answer to be obvious—but are a conventionalized speech act for the
purpose of social interaction. The standard answer is an affirmative repetition of the verb
phrase (see §17.4.5 below). One of the most conventionalized of these questions is the
standard morning greeting (example 132). Other common greetings are provided in
(136-38); (133) is often said when entering a house where a number of people are948gathered, and (135) is conventionally used to greet a visitor from another community
on his/her arrival in one’s own village. As expected, addressing more than one person
requires the second person plural pronoun nˆ¤N in place of singular /ám, as in (133).

The word order inversion strategy used in these predicate-focused polar questions
is undoubtedly the most typologically striking feature of Hup. Such use of word order
inversion in polar questions is common in European languages, but it is relatively
uncommon elsewhere in the world. Moreover, the fact that it is the only interrogative
subtype in Hup to use a word order inversion strategy violates—at least marginally—949Greenberg’s (1966) universal 11, which states that inversion with polar interrogatives
only occurs in those languages which use inversion to mark constituent interrogatives.193
However, inversion in polar questions is restricted in Hup; it involves only pronominal
subjects, and does not occur in constituent-focused polar questions (see §17.4.3 below).","[963, 964, 965, 966]"
"17.1. Boundary Suffixes and clause type
Morphologically, Hup clauses in general are loosely defined by the Boundary
Suffixes, as discussed in §3.4.1.2. While a heterogeneous group, the Boundary Suffixes
(particularly the set of ‘simple’ suffixes) generally share the function of indicating a
clause’s type. Accordingly, they distinguish dependent or co-subordinate clauses of
various kinds (adverbial, relative, complement, sequential, conditional, etc.) and main
clauses having a particular illocutionary force (e.g. negative, interrogative, optative,
imperative, etc.).
Of the Boundary Suffixes, a subset of forms—which share a vowel-copying
profile (plus an unmarked ‘zero’ form)—can be defined functionally as maximally
‘basic’ in that they mark several of the most distinctive clause types and are otherwise
largely semantically neutral (Table 17.1; see also §3.4.1.2). Although these morphemes
are heterogeneous in their patterning inside the clause (and may in some cases co-occur
within the clause), when they occur on a clause-final verbal predicate they are mutually903exclusive186 and correspond consistently to clause type. These are by far the most
frequently occurring Boundary Suffixes in Hup, although they are often supplanted by
various other Boundary Suffixes (e.g. the Verbal Negative -nˆ¤h (§16.1), the forceful
Imperative -kQ‡m (§17.5.2), etc.). Where they relate to declarative, interrogative, and
imperative clauses, the functions and patterning of the various Boundary Suffixes
(including these maximally ‘basic’ forms) will be discussed in this chapter. The clausemarking functions of other Boundary Suffixes are treated in chapter 18 and other sections
of this grammar.

The relative order of subject and verb plays an important role in defining

option is available for a given clause type, but it is the interaction of syntax and clausefinal morphological marking that is crucial in distinguishing one from another.

to note that other Boundary Suffixes may appear in their place. For example, verb-final

instead of the Declarative or Dynamic markers, and imperative clauses may take the
strong imperative suffix -kQ‡m instead of the -Ø form and high tone.

marking crucially depends on the semantics of the nominal. In general, object marking is230obligatory for human nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives, optional for animals, and
ungrammatical for inanimates.
It is relatively common cross-linguistically for object marking to be sensitive to
animacy, specificness, and even topicality (cf. Silverstein 1976, Croft 1990: 112, Blake
2001: 119-20). This phenomenon, by which some objects are marked and others are not,
depending on their semantic features, has been termed ‘differential object marking’
(Aissen 2003, Bossong 1998; cf. Zuñiga 2004). Aissen (2003: 437) discusses two
dimensions along which prominence of objects can be assessed for the purposes of
object-marking: animacy and definiteness. With respect to animacy, she posits a crosslinguistically general ranking to be the following: Human > Animate > Inanimate, and
with respect to definiteness, the following: Personal pronoun > Proper name > Definite
NP > Indefinite specific NP > Non-specific NP. The higher an entity falls on these
hierarchies, the more cross-linguistically likely it is to be overtly object-marked.
Examples of other differential object-marking languages include Hindi, in which nouns
are marked only when the referent is both specific and animate (Blake 2001: 120);
Sinhalese, where optional object marking is limited to animate-referring objects; and
Hebrew, where object marking is obligatory but limited to definite objects (Aissen 2003:
436).
Aissen (2003) characterizes the degree to which differential object marking
extends across the class of nouns in different languages as being determined by the
tension between two factors, economy and iconicity. Economy pushes the language to
avoid unnecessary additional morphological material, whereas iconicity fosters the use of
morphological complexity to facilitate comprehension. In a slightly different231interpretation of differential object marking, Hopper and Thompson (1980) consider
the presence of object marking in such languages to register a high degree of Transitivity
in the clause, specifically vis-à-vis the degree of individuation of the nominal entity.
In Hup, differential object marking corresponds closely to the animacy and
definiteness hierarchies. When examined in more fine-grained detail, certain
idiosyncrasies in this pattern only serve to reinforce the conclusion that the phenomenon
has to do with the individuation of entities, as the examples and discussion below
illustrate.
Despite the fact that both subjects and some objects are unmarked and that
constituent order is fairly free in Hup (see §17.3.1), ambiguity is easily avoided. Given
that differential object marking reflects the fact that humans are more prototypical agents,
whereas inanimate objects are more prototypical patients, any potential ambiguity
between agents and patients in Hup discourse is mostly limited to cases of interaction
between animals. When such cases do come up, context and the optional application of
object marking are the primary means of differentiating agents from patients, but if no
other clues are available speakers interpret the clause according to SO constituent order
(see §17.3.1).","[246, 247, 248]"

within a single compound, and for the different stems to take different objects. In
example (14), the verbs ‘break’ and ‘eat’ cannot be understood as taking the same object,
since the activity involves breaking the heads off sauva ants in order to eat the rest of the
ant (while the head is not eaten). In (15), the stem ‘pull up’ has the object ‘manioc’,
while the ditransitive stem ‘give’, within the same compound, has the object ‘her’ (3sg):(15)tˆ¤h-a‡nkaya‡ktç¤/hˆd3sg-OBJmanioctuber 2plkç/-nç¤/-ç¤y

stems to take different objects (although this is common in certain causative compounds;
see §9.4.1.2 below). As noted in §9.3 above, an alternative is a serial-like construction
with the verb ni- ‘be’. The ungrammatical form in (16a) is contrasted with the
grammatical, non-compound construction in (16b) (repeated from (7) above):

Causative compounds are relatively low on the scale of conceptual integration of events,
although considerably less so than are those compounds that encode temporal succession.
In causative compounds, stems encode multiple events, and although the construction has
only one grammatical subject, the actions themselves necessarily have different
underlying actors. Thus while they are constructed like many compound verbs, involving
a transitive stem plus an intransitive stem, these stems have a particular valency
relationship whereby the object of one is the subject of the other. The constructions
usually involve a relationship between two verb stems (although more are possible), in
which one component encodes a causative action (often involving manner), and the other
encodes the resulting event—both units of verbal meaning as described by Talmy (1985:
62-64).","[510, 511]"

Not every post-predicative NP can easily be interpreted as external to the main
clause, however, especially when the NP is not co-referential with another NP stated
within the main clause (as opposed to cases like examples 20 and 23, where the external
subject and object reference pronouns in the main clause). Subjects, as noted above,
frequently appear post-verbally, and there often is little or no evidence that this is
anything more than a variation in clause-internal constituent order (although subjects
certainly can and often do appear as external arguments, as the examples above
illustrate). In many of these cases of Verb-Subject constituent order, Declarative -Vêh is
not acceptable on the preceding verb (which may take the Dynamic or some other
Boundary Suffix), suggesting that the verb is clause-medial (example 24; see also 4-5915above). Post-verbal objects are likewise not always clearly external to the main
clause, as in (24-25); again, this is the case when the clausal chunks are not distinguished
from each other by the Declarative marker (which tends to be optional on clause-final
objects, unlike clause-final subjects) and the object is not co-referential with another NP.
Nevertheless, the verb or predicate of the clause is often separated from its clause-final
argument (whether subject or object) by a slight pause (as is the case in 24-25),
suggesting a juncture. The actual status of these post-verbal arguments as inside or
outside the main clause will have to await future research.","[931, 932]"
"8.3. The verbal template
As noted in §8.1, the defining characteristic of verb stems in Hup is their inability to
appear ‘bare’—without affixes—as predicates of a clause. The only exceptions to this
rule occur in apprehensive mood (§14.6), imperative mode (§17.5; but note that the stem
receives high tone), and in certain (co-)subordinated clauses (§18.2.2). Otherwise, the
verb word is multimorphemic: minimally, it involves a root and a Boundary Suffix;
maximally, it may include a procliticized subject nominal, up to two prefixes, multiple
component stems, multiple Inner Suffixes, a Boundary Suffix, and a string of enclitics
and particles. These different types of formatives all are considered to be
morphosyntactically part of the verb word, although the particles are relatively
phonologically free (see the discussion in §3.4).
This section deals with the verbal template as a combination of stem + formatives.
Note, however, that the ‘stem’ may itself be made up of a string of stems forming a472compound, as discussed in detail in chapter 9. A basic template for the verb word is
the following (note that generally obligatory elements appear in boldface):(Proclitic) = Prefix(es) - Stem - Inner Suffix(es) - Boundary Suffix = Enclitic(s) Particle(s)In reality, this template is not quite as neat as it appears. First, the distinction
between component verb stems (in compounds) and Inner Suffixes is somewhat blurry in
Hup. This synchronic fuzziness has a diachronic explanation: Inner Suffixes typically
grammaticalize from verbs within compounds, and some forms are currently in a
transitional phase (see §9.4.3). Second, most enclitics and particles can appear in the
Inner Suffix slot when followed by clause-final Boundary Suffixes (most commonly the
Declarative marker -Vêh) as discussed in §3.5. A few suffixes (Inchoative -ay, Negative
-nˆ¤h, and Future -tég) can optionally appear as either Boundary Suffixes or Inner
Suffixes. Finally, two of Hup’s three prefixes—Reflexive hup- and Reciprocal /u)h—can
optionally disassociate from the verb when occurring in a ditransitive construction with
an explicit object; in this context, these precede the object nominal and are best
considered particles (see §11.1 and §11.2).
Each of the formative classes in the template above is itself divided into a series
of slots, corresponding to the relative order of individual formatives that co-occur.
Depending on the formative, there is some flexibility in this order. A general schema of
the slot series that makes up the verbal template is given below, in which the numbers
correspond to the order of formatives when moving from left to right in the verb word.","[488, 489]"

kill-TEL-DYNM‘John killed the titi monkey, the one I saw.’ (EL)
Other features of the relative clause in Hup apply regardless of nominalization
strategy or headedness. Constituent order is generally like that of the declarative clause,
but is consistently verb-final (whereas the declarative clause is more variable), with no
tacked-on arguments external to the main part of the clause permitted. The order of
subject and object in transitive relative clauses depends on their topicality, just as it does
in declarative clauses, and subjects are frequently dropped. Most Inner Suffixes can
occur in a relative clause (preceding the Dependent marker, plural morpheme, or case
marker), e.g. Future/purpose -teg- / -te-, Habitual -bˆg- / -bˆ-, and Ventive -/ay-.
In keeping with their nominal identity, relative clauses pattern like nouns within
NPs, as well as within the clause. A headless relative clause (here nominalized by -Vp)
can—like any noun—precede an adjective modifier to form an adjective NP:(72)[/ãh nç¤-çp]
1sg say-DEPpóg /ãh tç¤n-ç¤h
big1sg hold-DECL‘I have a lot to say’ (T.PN.23)
In daily discourse, relative clauses are very common. One useful function they
serve is to facilitate reference to nameless entities, or provide alternative ways to talk
about something. For example, some speakers use the term /ˆn cák-ap=teg (1pl climb200It is possible that the variant -ˆt is a hold-over from an earlier form of the Oblique marker, that has since1002
DEP=THING) ‘the thing we climb’ in reference to a ladder (in place of the borrowedPortuguese name), and a speaker who wants to keep a bag of candy secret from the
children might refer to it as g’´‡h náw-a)p=/uç (sweet good-DEP=sack) ‘the tasty sack’.
The remainder of this discussion presents examples of relative clauses according
to the role of the relativized noun within the relative clause—as subject, object, or
oblique. Because the different strategies for nominalizing the relative clause also depend
on its role within the main clause (again as subject, object, or oblique) these distinctions
will also be reflected in the presentation.","[1018, 1019]"

Despite the strong preference for subject pronouns to precede the verb, this is not
absolutely obligatory in the Hup clause (although this order appears to be more fixed in
the Umari Norte dialect, in keeping with the pronouns’ more clitic-like identity in that
dialect). Highly salient, emphasized pronominal subjects may precede objects (especially
where these are themselves pronominal), as in example (16)—where the subject receives
additional emphasis through its clause-final repetition as an external argument.",[928]

Note that the occurrence of the preform hup- as separated from the verb by a
stated direct object is acceptable with the passive interpretation, as in the more
prototypical reflexive case (see §11.1.1 above):
(27)hˆd=báb’ hup=yágw’ˆ¤t-ˆ¤y3pl=sibling RFLX=hammock tie.hammock-DYNM‘Their brother is having his hammock tied (by someone else).’ (EL)
As discussed above, the interpretation of hup as a prefixed verbal Reflexive or an
encliticized nominal Reflexive intensifier may be ambiguous. Where the subject
undergoer of the (passive) clause outranks the actor (agent of the corresponding active
clause; now an oblique argument) in terms of person or humanness, a passive reading is
typically the default interpretation of a clause with hup (regardless of word order, as in
example (23) above). On the other hand, in the case where the oblique actor outranks the
subject undergoer, the interpretation of hup can be sensitive to variation in word order.
This is illustrated in the elicited paradigm in example (28); the clause receives a
reflexive/passive reading in (28a-b), but when the morphologically unmarked (i.e.
nominative-case) participant immediately precedes the reflexive marker (28c-d), the
default interpretation of the clause is active, and hup is understood as the Reflexive
intensifier.","[603, 604]"
"9.4.2.2. Order of stems in compounds
Integrated compounds formed from the stems in the classes above are very common in
Hup. The order of combination of stems follows specific conventions based on their
class membership. Since these are semantically defined classes, it is possible to make a
semantic generalization about the stem-ordering conventions: the most time-stable
concept is the last in the string of stems. The members of the two closed classes,
motion/path and position, are relatively time-stable and tend to be last when they occur.
When members of closed or open classes co-occur, their order likewise depends on which
element is the more permanent or resultative. This stem-ordering principle for integrated509compounds is thus closely related to the principle of temporal succession that dictates
the formation of less integrated compounds.
That the final element in a compound is in some sense the ‘main’ verb is
supported semantically, since it provides a kind of matrix or context for the other events.
It is also supported formally, since Hup is a verb-final language; that is, being head-final
at clause level seems to be mirrored by being head-final at word level. Finally, as in the
case of causative compounds, a combination of a transitive and an intransitive stem
results in a transitive construction.
Below, I offer examples of the various possible combinations of these stem
classes. Note that the reverse order of stems is ungrammatical for virtually all; in the
very few cases (noted in the text) where it is grammatical, it usually results in a different
meaning.a. Manner/activity + Motion/path (open + closed class).
Examples of this type of compounding include nç-ham- (say-go) ‘go along
saying’, tac-[k´d-hi-] (kick-pass-descend) ‘go downstream fast, hitting against things’,
j’çm-ham- (bathe-go) ‘swim’, j’ç‚y-nQn- ‘slither along ground toward deictic center’ (i.e.
a snake), and k´k-w’ob-ham- (pull-set-go) ‘catch and set out (fish) while going along’.

"17.4.3. Polar questions with focus on constituent
This interrogative strategy is typically used in questions involving a focused constituent,
and is also very common for rhetorical purposes, such as when responding to a speaker
(i.e. a ‘backchanneling’ strategy akin to ‘really?’, ‘is that right?’, ‘uh-huh’, etc. in
English). Its formal organization is essentially like that of the constituent or ‘questionword’ question, but without the initial question word; however, like the predicate-focused
polar questions discussed above, it solicits a yes-no answer. Its constituent order is the
same as that of the typical declarative clause, from which it is formally distinguished by
the presence of the Interrogative Boundary Suffix -V/ (or the unreduced form of the
Future suffix -tég) on the clause-final verb, in place of the Declarative marker -Vêh.
Intonation in these interrogatives tends to peak clause-initially on the focused constituent
(usually a nominal or adverbial), and fall at the end of the clause.
While soliciting a yes-no answer, these questions front a non-predicative
constituent of the clause, which is understood (via this fronting strategy) to be the focus
of the question.194 In many cases, this results in a semi-rhetorical question—i.e. a193Note that word order inversion is attested in Hup constituent questions, but only those involving the
exceptional interrogative verb forms ‘say’ and ‘be like’ (§17.4.1).

generally, not just interrogatives (see §17.3.1).",[966]

In the case of more tightly integrated compounds (in which the final stem carries
aspectual, modal, or other information; cf. §9.4.2), on the other hand, negating the
assertion of the corresponding affirmative clause frequently does not require splitting up
the compound, even though the negation may be more directly relevant to one component
stem than another. Thus in example (17), the negative of ‘sing loudly’ or ‘make noise
singing’ remains a verb compound, even though consultants judge it to be neutral as to
whether the singing itself continues or not. Similarly, the negation in (18-19) has scope881over the entire compound (‘order/tell to do Verb’), regardless of whether the activity
took place or not.184(17)yam-hç‚h-nˆ¤h=yˆ/níh!sing-make.noise-NEG=TEL be.IMP‘Don’t sing loudly!’ (EL)

As noted above, the Negative suffix -nˆ¤h typically has scope only over the verb
phrase in which it appears. However, when clause coordination involves a string of
sequential activities (marked with the Sequential suffix -yó/, which is itself incompatible
with -nˆ¤h; see §16.1.5 below), the interpretation of negative scope appears to be more
flexible. Example (20) comes from a speech delivered to the community, and lists a
series of activities that women are expected to do to carry out the planting of manioc;
only the last verb carries the negation, but the utterance was interpreted to mean that
women do none of these things (without some involvement on the part of their husbands).
However—especially with a definite subject such as yúp=/ãêy ‘that woman’—the
interpretation that all the activities were carried out except the last, explicitly negative
one is also possible.","[897, 898]"

This prevalence of pronominal subjects, which appear to be marginally procliticized to
the verb, may represent an early step towards the historical development of a system of
pronominal clitics—a process which, when further developed, often gives rise to verbal
person agreement. Such systems of person-marking on the verb are fairly common in
Amazonian languages.
Other orders of predicates and arguments are possible in Hup, although they are
less clearly limited to the domain of a single clause. As mentioned briefly above, Hup
has a productive strategy of information packaging that involves the stringing along of
arguments after the predicate. These arguments appear as self-contained pieces of
information that relate to, but occur outside, the main clause, as external arguments or913antitopics. In many cases, the fact that these external arguments occur outside the
main clause proper is signaled by the ability of both the argument and the preceding
predicate to independently take the Declarative suffix -Vêh. Because the Declarative
suffix is not grammatical clause-internally, the -Vêh-marked predicate preceding the
external argument cannot be interpreted as clause-medial. Moreover, the main clause and
its external argument are typically separated from each other by a short pause and/or
intonation juncture.
This external argument strategy is common with objects, as illustrated in the
following examples. In (20) both subject and object are stated as pronouns in the main
clause, and then restated more explicitly in the string of arguments that follow.

This strategy of expressing arguments externally to the main clause also applies to
oblique constituents, as in (21), where the demonstrative ‘here’ of the main clause is
elaborated following the predicate.","[929, 930]"

In example (68), two nested compounds are linked together in temporal sequence:(68)[way-d’o/]-[nçh-d’a‡k]=d’´h,de‡hdadáp=d’´h[go.out-take]-[fall-stick.against]= PLwaterroach=PL‘The ones who had taken flight and hit against (the sky), the water-roaches…’
(LG.13)In a few cases, however, stems appear to follow the opposite order from that of
the temporal sequence of the events. This resembles the “inverse relationship” of stems
in Barasana and Tatuyo compounds, as described by Gómez-Imbert (1988: 103). In Hup,
these are all compounds whose stems have a relationship based on purpose, as we see in
(69-71). All the examples of this ‘inverse’ ordering type encountered have a motion/path
verb as the second stem.
(69)hˆd[yam]-[cak-g’et]-/é-h3pldance/sing-[raise.up-stand]-PERF-DECL‘They used to stand up in order to sing/dance.’ (T.int.5)
(70)/ayu‡p=/i‚h [key]-[wçn-hám]-ay-áh
one=MSCsee-[follow-go]-INCH-DECL‘A man followed after in order to see (where the spirit went).’ (P87)
(71)wç‡h=n’a‡n (…)d’o/-[hup-hipãh]-[nQn]-ní-hRiver.Indian=PL.OBJtake-[RFLX-know]-[come]-INFR2-DECL‘He made the River Indians come in order to be educated.’ (H)
(repeated from (95) above)518These examples are probably not as exceptional as they might appear at first
glance. First, since the compounded meaning is one of purpose, and the compound itself
is neutral as to whether or not the intended activity was actually carried out, the final verb
is actually more grounded in real time and real events, hence in a sense more ‘stable’.
Moreover, these compounds correspond to the formal ordering conventions based on the
semantic classes above, in which position and motion/path information tends to occur
last.
The causative compounds in §9.4.1.2b, in which the causative stem follows the
stem representing the caused event (V-bˆ/- [V-make] ‘make sick’ and V-yQ‚h- [V-compel]
‘compel, order to V’), represent a similar ‘inversion’ of the temporal order of events. In
these compounds, the causative component is final, even though (at least as a distinct
event) it is temporally prior and less resultative than the effect. However, the case of
yQ‚h- ‘compel, order, request’ is like the ‘purpose’ forms above in that it does not entail
that the activity be actually carried out (its uses range from straightforward requests to
actual causatives). A similar situation may be behind the causative bˆ/-, which
presumably entails only the act of the causer, and not necessarily the resulting effect.
A few other exceptional cases of stem ordering exist in my corpus, although these
are not common. They illustrate that—for certain compounds—the order of stems may
be relatively flexible, and probably depends largely on the speaker’s construal of the
event, particularly which aspect he/she considers more salient or more continuous. In
(72) (from the Origin Story), for example, the simultaneous events of exiting-while-519seated and crying are presented in an order opposite to that which their semantic
classes would predict—the activity/manner verb ‘cry’ would be expected to come first,
but is compound-final. Consultants judge the more expected variants /çt-way-pQm(cry-go.out-sit) and /çt-pQm-way- (cry-sit-go.out) to be grammatically and semantically
comparable; other combinations are considered to be more questionable.","[533, 534, 535, 536]"
"17.3.3.2. Adjectival predicates
As discussed in detail in §10.1 (and briefly in §3.1.3), adjectives are a distinct, closed
word class in Hup, with properties of both nouns and verbs; as predicates, they pattern
much like verbs—although unlike verbs, they do not require a Boundary Suffix.
Predicate adjective clauses do not take a copula (probably because predicate adjectives
already have a semi-verbal status); a copula is grammatical only if the adjective is
nominalized and appears as a predicate nominal, and the clause is marked with tenseaspect inflection.
Predicate adjective clauses—in which the adjectival predicate is unmarked with
any inflection—are illustrated in the following examples:(70)wowó=hinnáwpˆ¤d,hehé=hin náw pˆ¤dwowo.flute=alsogoodDISTpan-flutegood DIST‘The wowo flute is also nice; the pan-flute is also nice.’ (H.txt.23)
(71)de‡hpáy !water bad‘The rain is unpleasant!’ (OS)
Although predicate adjectives (unlike verbs) do not require a Boundary Suffix, a
Boundary Suffix may be present—such as the Dynamic (see §12.2), the Declarative (7273), or other forms. The Declarative suffix is required on a clause-final subject, as in any
other Hup clause (examples 74-75) (note that Predicate-Subject and Subject-Predicate
word order may be interchangeable, as in 73-74). Example (74) náw yúw-úh ‘that’s931good’ may be compared with its phonologically reduced, conventionalized variant
náw yúh ‘thank you’.","[947, 948]"

"5.1. Noun compounding
Noun compounding in Hup is a highly productive process. In general, it creates a
syntactic construction composed of two juxtaposed nominal forms, the second of which
counts as the head:N1
N2
[Modifier Head]
Semantically, the compound construction can indicate relationships of three types: a
possessor-possessed relationship, a whole-part relationship, or a property-entity
relationship. The use of compounding to indicate possessor-possessed or whole-part
(metonymic) relationships is reported to be common in South American languages;
examples include the compound laka lawe (chin hair) ‘beard’ in Pilagá, and pike lamo
(arm trunk) ‘upper arm’ in Toba (Klein 2000: 85-6).
In compounds expressing a possessor-possessed relationship, the two entities are
understood to be directly associated with each other, such that the N1 can be considered
in some sense the possessor or proprietor of the N2 (examples 1-2; NB: the order of

"5169.4.2.3. Complex compounds: ordering of multiple stems
These ordering principles interact with the temporal succession principle discussed above
to organize compounds that are made up of multiple stems. In (63), for example, the
manner/activity stem j’ˆp- ‘lash (tie) to’ precedes the posture stem m’Qc- ‘squeeze tight’,
which in turn precedes the position stem d’ak- ‘stick against, be against a vertical
surface’—an ordering that iconically mirrors the ordering of events:(63)tú/-úth ˆdj’ˆ‚p-m’Qc-d’ak-yˆ¤/-ay-áhhouse.pole-OBL3pllash-squeeze.tight-stick.against-TEL-INCH-DECL‘They tied (his basket) tightly against the house-pole.’ (P85)
More integrated compounds are often ‘nested’ inside larger, less-integrated
compounds. Thus the organizing principles discussed above can apply on several levels
within the same verb word, as the following examples illustrate.","[532, 533]"

Hup’s third strategy for creating a relative clause relies on nominalization via a
case marker (Object -a‡n or Oblique -Vêt). These relative clauses are fully headless, and
(like those nominalized by Plural =d’´h) they lack the Dependent marker -Vp. They are
nominalized by the addition of the case marker directly to the verb stem, with the Filler
syllable -Vw- (cf. §15.2.4) appearing obligatorily in the middle. Crucially, these relative
clauses must occupy the object or oblique position within the main clause in order to
receive the corresponding case marker. Headless relative clauses are extremely common
in object or oblique positions within the main clause (more common, in fact, than are
headed clauses in these positions), whereas they are very rare in subject position (where
they are nominalized by -Vp only, as discussed above).
A headless relative clause nominalized by the Object marker is given in example
(69). Significantly, the use of the Object marker in headless relative clauses is
irrespective of the animacy or number of the referent, whereas differential object marking
(whereby singular inanimate nouns are never Object-marked; see §4.3.1.2) applies tomost other nouns in Hup. Elsewhere in Hup, the Object marker -a‡n appears only as a1000case marker on nominals (but cf. the directional oblique form -an, used both for nominals
and in adverbial clauses; see §18.2.6.2).","[1016, 1017]"

appears strictly as a verbal preform in its manifestation as a valency-decreasing Reflexive
marker. As a Reflexive, hup- indicates generally that the grammatical subject is being
directly acted upon. Interpretations of the constructions in which it occurs can vary; the
use of hup- can result in a standard reflexive reading (i.e. the subject acts on him/herself
directly), a passive (some other participant acts on the subject), or—more marginally—a
reciprocal (coordinated subjects act on each other), depending on the semantics of the
verb and on the general context.
A correlation between passive, reflexive, and reciprocal constructions is not
uncommon cross-linguistically. Shibatani (1985: 826) observes that many languages
exhibit such a correlation, including Spanish, Russian, Quechua, and Yavapai, and he
offers the explanation that this similarity “arises largely from a semantic property of these
constructions: in all of them, surface subjects are affected” (1985: 840). In other words,
these constructions all involve a reduction in the Transitivity of the clause (in the sense of579Hopper and Thompson 1980), in that the grammatical subject is in some way also a
semantic patient.
Formally, the Reflexive form hup- displays the properties typical of Hup
preforms: it is unstressed, is not separated from its verbal host by pause phenomena, and
no other constituents can come between it and the verb (with the exception of an object of
a ditransitive verb; see below). Requirements for the use of Reflexive hup- include the
stipulation that it can occur only with a transitive or ditransitive verb; it is ungrammatical
with an intransitive verb, as illustrated in example (6a). In any case where the form hup
does occur in a clause with a subject nominal and an intransitive verb, it can only be
interpreted as a Reflexive intensifier, encliticized to the noun, as in (6b); it cannot act as
an impersonal subject, since a subject is already present.","[595, 596]"
"9.4.1. Low integration
These Hup compounds are much like the “iconic” serial verbs described by Durie (1997:
330), and the “symmetrical” serial verbs (where stems all come from a large open class)
that Aikhenvald (2003: 424) identifies for Tariana. They also resemble the class of
Barasana and Tatuyo (Eastern Tukanoan) compound verbs that encode a “direct
relationship” between stems (Gómez-Imbert 1988).
Compounds of this type represent a set of distinct sub-events (each indicated by a
component stem) that are conceptualized (often loosely) as a single, unified event. By
definition (and in contrast with the relatively more integrated compounds discussed in
§9.4.2 below), the events encoded by the stems are temporally distinct; that is, they are
not simultaneous. The order of verb stems reflects the chronological order of sub-events,
111Ospina (2002: 381) reports that in Yuhup, old peoples’ speech occasionally suggests traces of the basic
TAM suffix -i occurring between verb stems within compounds. She observes that this may reflect a prior492or a cause-effect relationship between them, and in many cases the compound can be
broken up into a series of multiple, coordinated predicates without changing the general
meaning of the utterance. The type of event that may be conceptualized as unitary varies
from language to language (Durie 1997: 326-9); for example, the chain of events
represented in the compound in (8) below could not be represented in a single serial verb
construction in some African languages, such as Fongbe (Claire Lefebvre, p.c.).","[508, 509]"
"62811.5.1. Derivation of causatives
As described in detail in §9.4.1.2, Hup makes productive use of verb compounding to
create expressions of complex valency. These compounds are formed via the
combination of transitive and intransitive stems, and result in a transitive verb. In
general, Hup is a ‘transitivizing language’ in the terminology of Nichols et al (2004); that
is, causatives are usually derived (either via verb compounding or Factitive hi-, as
discussed in §11.4 above).
The most commonly used causativizing stems in verb compounds are somewhat
grammaticalized, and contribute a semantics to causative constructions that is distinct
from their meanings as independent verbs. Among the most productive of these are the
compound-initial transitive stems d’o/- (literally) ‘take’ (causation with direct
involvement), as in d’o/-/ç‚h- (take-sleep) ‘put to sleep’ (i.e. a child); d’´h- ‘send’
(causation with less direct control over the event), as in tac-d’´h-ye- (kick-send-enter)
‘cause to go into (house, etc.) by kicking’; and g’et- ‘stand’ (oversee, bring about
another’s action), as in g’et-bˆ/- (stand-work) ‘lead/oversee in working’. Several
compound-final roots are also used productively to create causative verb compounds;
these include bˆ/- ‘work’ (bring about through effort), as in pe/-bˆ/- (sick-make) ‘make
(someone) sick’; and yQ‚h- ‘compel, request, order’ (force or request another’s action), as
in wQd-yQ‚h- (eat-order) ‘compel or order to eat’. Note that different causative verb roots
can sometimes also be substituted for each other, resulting in variations in meaning, suchas g’et-wQd- (stand-eat-) ‘feed, provide with food’, vs. wQd-yQ‚h- (eat-order/compel)629‘make, order to eat’.
The pattern for forming causative and non-causative variants of verbs varies
across lexical items.142 The majority of intransitive roots must participate in a causative
verb compound in order to have a causative interpretation, such as pQm- ‘sit’, wQd- ‘eat’,
and wçç- ‘boil’:
(112) a)de‡hwç¤ç-ç¤ywaterboil-DYNM‘The water is boiling.’
b)pe‡dde‡hd’o/-wç¤ç-ç¤yPed water take-boil-DYNM
‘Ped boils the water.’ (EL)In other cases (mostly involving stative verbs; cf. §8.2), the derived form of the causative
is optional, and the underived form may be used both as a causative and a non-causative,
without any apparent semantic difference:(113) a)hˆ‡/=tegt´h-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤ywrite=stick break-TEL-DYNM‘The pencil broke.’ (EL)
b)pe‡dhˆ‡/=teg (d’o/-)t´h-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤yPedwrite=stick (take-)break-TEL-DYNM‘Ped broke the pencil.’ (EL)
Occasionally, the causative form is basic, and the non-causative is derived via the
addition of the Reflexive prefix hup-:(114) a)pe‡dhup-y´¤d-´¤yPedRFLX-hide-DYNM630‘Ped hides.’ (EL)
b)mç‡tpe‡d-ány´¤d-´¤yMçtPed-OBJ hide-DYNM‘Mçt hides Ped.’ (EL)
In one or two cases both forms are derived, as in ‘turn over’, from the verb k´d- ‘pass’:
(115) a)cug’Q‡thup-k´¤d-´¤yleafRFLX-pass-DYNM‘The leaf turned over.’ (EL)
b)pedcug’Q‡t d’o/-(hup-)k´¤d-´¤yPedleaftake-(RFLX-)pass-DYNM‘Ped turned the leaf over.’ (EL)Finally, suppletive causative and non-causative pairs are rare in Hup, but there are a few
examples, such as na/- ‘die’ and mQh- ‘kill’; key- ‘see’ and be- ‘show’.
In some cases, more than one derivational option is available in creating a
causative form, with corresponding semantic distinctions. For example, the causative
form tuj-d’ak- ‘set alight’ is preferred as the counterpart of the non-causative hç‚- ‘burn’
(e.g. for a house, clothes, possessions, wood, etc.; example 116), but the root hç‚- may
also be used causatively in very particular circumstances where there is no normal setting
of a fire—e.g. by means of a bomb (example 117). The morphological causative form
d’o/-hç‚- can be used in reference to letting someone’s food burn while it is cooking
(example 118).","[644, 645, 646, 647]"
"INTERJ 3sg=black-FLR-DECLdarn it; (it was) a black one!’ (B.Cv.93)
In (127), the interrogative form hˆ‚-n’ˆh ‘what’ (a derived nominal) occurs in place of an
adjective (some unspecified color value), preserving the bound nominal construction.

Stress and tone (word-accent) patterns for adjectival NPs are not fully consistent
across speakers and speech events. The underlying lexical tone value for adjectives is
almost always high tone, with the primary exception of bˆÙg ‘old’ (it is possible that this
may be at least partially motivated by the contrast with bˆêg ‘tapir’). In general, a noun
phrase composed of [N Adj] is treated phonologically as a single lexical unit, with
primary stress on the second constituent. In the case of tˆh=Adj constructions, this stress
pattern is quite consistent: tone always falls on the adjective and is realized as rising
(except in the case of CV roots, which always have high tone). In NPs involving full
lexical nouns, on the other hand, tone on the adjective may vary. The pattern in less
careful speech tends to favor a pattern like that of the tˆh= form (including rising tone on
the adjective), but in more careful speech (especially in cases of potential ambiguity, such
as when the speaker is confronted with a minimal pair set contrasting by tone), the noun
may receive equal stress and take tone. In these cases, the following adjective assumes411its underlying tonal value (and so is usually high). In at least one case, this general
pattern gives rise to a minimal pair contrast:
(128) tˆh=po‡g
tˆh póg(3sg=big)
(lie big)‘big one’
‘liar’ (literally ‘big liar’, although tˆh by itself is not
generally used in this sense)Note that this pattern for tˆh= adjectival NPs is consistent with the most frequent wordaccent (stress/tone) pattern for bisyllabic (monomorphemic) lexical items in general (see
§2.3.2), and bound nouns with tˆh= are also always stressed on the N2.
The fact that adjective modifiers must take an explicit preceding nominal, for
which the default is the tˆh= preform, gives them a formal resemblance to bound (and
inalienably possessed) nouns in Hup (see §5.4). Compare, for example, the human noun
‘child’ and the adjective ‘big’ in the nominal constructions in (129):(129) a)tiyi‡/=dó/
tˆh=dó/‘male child’
‘child’b)tiyi/ po‡g
tˆh=po‡g‘big man’
‘big one’Functionally, too, there are parallels between the two constructions. The
prototypical bound noun construction signals an inherent relationship between two
entities, where the first possesses and/or defines the second (e.g. in a whole-part
relationship; see §5.5); likewise the adjective denotes a property that is inseparable from
the entity that ‘possesses’ it, and may be difficult or impossible to even conceptualize
without some kind of physical embodiment. Similarly, the association indicated by the
bound noun construction also helps to individuate the entity in question from other412entities like it (i.e. by restricting a set), just as the denotation of a property may have a
restrictive function, helping to pick out an individual referent from the set of possible
referents—although adjectives do not just restrict reference, but also enrich the semantics
of a known entity.
Given the formal and functional parallels between the adjectival NP and the
bound noun NP, could these actually be one and the same construction? If so, then the
relative order of modifier and head in the adjectival NP must be the opposite of what it
seems, as defined earlier in this section: [(Nom) Head + (Adj.) Modifier], where the
adjective is the modifier and the noun the head. As example (129a) above illustrates, the
bound noun construction involves the order [Modifier + Head]; is this actually the
structure of the adjectival NP as well? This does indeed seem to be the case for
adjectival NPs taking the dummy nominal tˆh—which is both semantically contentless
and phonetically unstressed, as in (129b) above (tˆh=po‡g ‘the big one’); here the
adjective (and final element of the NP) is a plausible head, at least semantically. This
type of adjectival NP really does appear to mirror the bound noun construction.
On the other hand, it seems much less plausible to assume that a noun-adjective
NP containing a full noun—such as tiyi/ po‡g (man big) in 129b—should have the order
of [(Nom) Modifier + (Adj) Head]; that is, that the adjective should be the head of the
construction. Yet could the adjectival NP in Hup be internally inconsistent, in that one
type has one order, and the other the opposite order?
It is difficult to resolve these questions definitively, since there are few syntactic
clues to headedness in Hup. However, to the extent that heads can be determined at all,413there is actually no reason to think that head-modifier order cannot vary within the
Hup NP; in fact, such syntactic inconsistency already exists among different subtypes of
the bound noun constructions. In §5.6, I argue that the semantic head of the bound-noun
NP may be ambiguous, and that for many NPs involving classifying bound nouns, this
ambiguity has fostered a switch of the syntactic head of the construction from N2 to N1.
Thus interpreting one type of adjectival NP as having head-modifier order while the other
has modifier-head order is not inconsistent with the facts of Hup more generally.
Given that significant differences between subtypes of bound-noun NPs and
adjectival NPs are possible in Hup, the question of whether the two constructions should
themselves be considered one and the same becomes less meaningful. Instead, it makes
more sense to consider them as distinct types of NP that simply share a number of
features. In fact, upon closer inspection, quite a few differences between them can be
identified.
First, were the parallel with the bound noun construction complete, we would
have to assume that the ‘adjective’ head of the adjectival NP is itself no more than a
bound noun; however, the set of bound nouns and the set of adjectives in Hup do not
actually pattern in the same way at all. Adjectives must be preceded by a nominal when
acting as the argument of a predicate, but appear alone (i.e. bare) as predicates
themselves; most bound nouns, on the other hand, can appear outside the bound
construction in contexts where semantic individuation is irrelevant, but otherwise can
only function as predicate (nominals) while bound. As the discussion in §3.1.3
illustrates, the identity of adjectives as a formal class of their own hinges on their
possession of both nominal and verbal qualities, and their ability to move freely between414argument and predicate constructions—usually retaining attributes of the one while
functioning as the other, and vice versa.
Other features of adjectival NPs that differentiate them from purely nominal NPs
include their stress pattern: while bound noun constructions with a full noun as N1
typically have primary stress either on the N1 only, or on both members of the compound
construction (e.g. tiyi‡/=dó/ (man=child) ‘male child’), stress in noun + adjective NPs
usually falls on the adjective (this difference can be seen in example 129 above). Yet
another difference involves the verbal negation strategy, which can be applied to
adjective modifiers within NPs (see 119 above); in the case of bound nouns, on the other
hand, the entire NP (and not simply the bound noun within it) must be negated by a
nominal negation strategy. Finally, another difference is the fact that unmodified
adjectives—unlike bound nouns—do not directly follow a numeral acting as N1
(although they can follow a demonstrative, see above). Instead, the adjective appears in
nominalized form with tˆh=, as in (130).
(130) ko/a‡p tˆh=po‡g tˆh tç¤n-ç¤h

The differences between the adnominal adjectives and the bound nouns are
summarized in Table 6.9.","[427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"
"488Hup has only one marginal process that could perhaps be considered a form of
verb serialization. In this construction, the verb ni- (see §8.4) is required as the final verb
in the series, and takes the Boundary Suffix and any other inflectional marking. The
preceding verbs are bare, lacking a Boundary Suffix or peripheral formatives (although
they may take certain Inner Suffixes). They are clearly distinct words; they take
independent stress, and are often preceded by nominal subject or object arguments. This
most common realization of this phenomenon involves the repetition of the same bare
verb to form a ‘reduplicative predicate’ (example 6); this phenomenon is discussed in
more detail in §18.2.2. However, the phenomenon can also involve different verbs, as in
example (7). This is rare, but it seems to be the preferred choice when expressing an
event that is perceived as relatively conceptually unitary, and using transitive verbs
having different objects to do so (these verbs are not usually expressed as a compound;
see §9.4.1.1, example (16) below).

Other than this phenomenon—which may be better described as cosubordination
or chaining on the predicative level, rather than on the nuclear level (cf. §18.2.2)—Hup
has no distinct process of verb serialization. However, because Hup compound verbs are489neither fully lexical, nor fully phrasal entities, they themselves have much in common
with other cross-linguistically defined processes of verb serialization.
The range of more or less conceptually unified events reflected in Hup compound
verbs resembles the ‘iconic’ and ‘non-iconic’ types of serial verbs defined by Durie
(1997: 330-1), and the ‘symmetric’ and ‘asymmetric’ classes of serial verbs that
Aikhenvald describes for Tariana (1999, 2000: 4-5). Like serial verbs, Hup compounds
often follow iconic principles, where verb order corresponds to temporal succession of
actions, including sub-events in a cause-effect relationship. Also like serial verbs, other
compounds in Hup do not follow temporal iconicity, but represent coincident motion,
posture, and manner (cf. Durie 1997: 336). Verb serialization, according to Durie (1997:
322), is “universally characterized by heavy lexicalization”, but this exists alongside
productivity of serialization “because many events can be typed in terms of certain
predictable internal structures and structural components”. Moreover, serial verb
constructions are subject to cross-linguistic constraints against duplicate participant roles,
such as two agents (Durie 1997: 343). These are all properties of Hup compound verbs.
Other features of Hup compound verbs are perhaps even more typical of
cosubordination processes such as serialization than they are of compounding generally.
These include the high productivity of Hup compounds and their tendency to encode
multiple events—even relatively distinct events—in temporal succession. They also
include compounds’ internal bracketing—i.e. the ‘nesting’ of compounds that are
themselves components of larger compounds, and the ability of certain prefixes to occur
together with the particular stems over which they have scope. Finally, the productive
verbal constructions on the ‘less-integrated’ side of the spectrum in Hup do not conform490to Payne’s (1997: 233) description of a compound as having ‘bleached’ semantics, i.e.
a distinct lexical meaning beyond that encoded in its parts.
It is worth noting that the serial verbs in neighboring Tariana resemble Hup
compounds closely in that they do not allow nominal constituents to come between stems
(Aikhenvald 2003: 424-25), unlike many serial constructions in African languages (cf.
Lefebvre 1991). Tariana does permit affixal material encoding person, number, tense,
and other information to occur between stems, but Hup has less material that could come
between its verb stems, since it does not mark person or number on verbs to begin with,
and marks tense more rarely than does Tariana.
Despite these similarities between the Hup verbal construction and the serial
verbs found in other languages, it is clear that the Hup verb is consistently a single word
both phonologically (as determined primarily by stress) and morphosyntactically (as
determined by the inability for other morphological material to break up component
stems, and by the assignment of a single Boundary Suffix to the end of the compound),
and is therefore best considered a compound. Nevertheless, as a class, the Hup verb
compounds do not fit neatly into either the lexicon or the grammar, and show other
characteristics that are more reminiscent of serial verb constructions. It is possible that
Hup has developed verb compounding from earlier processes of serialization, but this
question must be left for future research.1114919.4. The Hup compound and levels of sub-event integration
As a single-predicate, cosubordinate construction, a compound verb in Hup must encode
an event that has a degree of conceptual unity. When this unity is not judged to be
present, the events are necessarily represented by two predicates, linked by subordination
or coordination strategies. However, among compound verbs, the linked stems can
encode a variety of more or less conceptually integrated sub-events. These range from
the least integrated, in which the component stems of the compound represent a series of
distinct sub-events in temporal succession, to the most integrated, where some stems act
as auxiliaries to modify others.","[504, 505, 506, 507, 508]"

wire) to be more conceptually relevant than its supported position. (Note that this is

seated in the canoe throughout the journey, as the canoe traveled up and down river after
river. The relative time-stability of their sitting, as opposed to the more short-term event
of exiting a location, probably explains the order of the stems.","[529, 530]"

"Comparative Note
Verb compounding is an areal feature in the Vaupés region. It is a very
productive process in East Tukanoan languages, in which—as in Hup—verb compounds
make up a single phonological word, and roots tend to follow a fixed order, inseparable
by other morphemes (cf. Miller 1999: 88, Aikhenvald 2002b: 137). Tukanoan verb
compounds likewise often involve the combination of both a transitive and an intransitive
stem, resulting in a construction with complex valency—and like Hup, the Tukanoan483languages are verb-final. Verb compounding in East Tukanoan languages also
diachronically yields markers of aspect, valency-changing, and Aktionsart. Unlike Hup
compounds, on the other hand, compounds in Tukano normally have no more than two
co-occurring verbs (Ramirez 1997: 375, Aikhenvald 2000: 9). Both productive verb
serialization and limited verb compounding exist in Tariana (Aikhenvald 2002b: 136-7).
Some of the parallels between Hup verbal constructions and the compound verbs in the
Tukanoan languages, as described by Ramirez (1997: 375), Miller (1999) and GómezImbert (1988), as well as the serial and compound verbs in Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003),

While these forms do not in general require the adverbial form =yˆ/ when used as
adverbs, =yˆ/ does appear to be necessary when the adverb directly follows the subject
nominal, in order to distinguish it from an adjectival modifier within the NP. The
following examples can be compared with (16) above:
(17)a)tiyi‡/pˆ¤b=yˆ/way-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤ymanfast=TELgo.out-TEL-DYNM‘The man went out fast.’550b)[tiyi‡/pˆ¤b]manfast/strong go.out-TEL-DYNMway-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y‘The fast/strong man went out.’ (EL)
In contrast to ‘fast’, ‘well’, ‘badly’, etc., many other adjectives normally take
derivational =yˆ/ in order to act as adverbs in any context; these include ‘big’ and ‘small’
(examples 18-20). This tendency of adjectives to appear as adverbs with or without overt
derivational morphology is determined largely on a lexically specific basis.","[565, 566, 567]"

While ni- is the main copula verb in Hup, a few other verbs can serve a quasicopular function in certain contexts. In particular, the concept ‘become’ is expressed by
the verb hidoho-, and the verb ham- ‘go’ is also occasionally used in this sense, as with
the nominalized predicate adjective in example (94):(94)yˆ-d’´‡hyúptˆh=páy=d’´hthat.ITG-PL that.ITG 3sg=bad=PLham-ní-h

Hup has three main types of interrogative clause, which differ from each other both
formally and functionally. These are constituent or ‘question-word’ questions, polar
(yes-no) questions with emphasis on the predicate, and polar questions with emphasis on
a constituent (typically used in discursive backchanneling). The features that formally
define the interrogative clause vis-à-vis other clause types in Hup are constituent order,
the presence of a question word (interrogative pronoun, demonstrative, or adverbial), andthe presence of the Interrogative suffix -V/, although which of these are present938depends on the subtype of interrogative. Crucially, the Declarative suffix never occurs in
an interrogative clause. Two clause-final particles (ya‡ and ti‡ ) are also used primarily in
interrogatives as discourse tags (see §15.3), and are acceptable with all three subtypes of
interrogative clause. Most verbal inflectional forms are acceptable in interrogative
clauses, including evidentials (see §14.9).19117.4.1. Constituent (question-word) questions
The primary function of constituent or ‘question-word’ questions is to solicit specific
information. The formal organization of these clauses is quite distinct: the clause begins
with a question word (an interrogative pronoun, determiner, or adverbial), and—when a
verbal predicate is present—the clause ends with a verb inflected with the Interrogative
suffix -V/.
The Hup question words are discussed in detail in §6.3 (Table 6.2), and are
summarized in (95) below. With the exception of the interrogative pronoun used
specifically for human referents (/u‡y ‘who’), all of the question words are derived from
the interrogative particle hˆ‚. In addition to appearing as focused constituents in
interrogative predicates, the question words can all stand alone as independent
interrogative utterances.","[954, 955]"
"28them). People should not eat both meat and fish at the same time; if they do, cysts will
emerge on their bodies.
Verbal art is quite rich among the Hupd’´h, and includes a variety of traditional
stories and personal narratives, the kapiwaya and song styles mentioned above, and
spells. Speeches are impromptu and are not particularly stylized. Musical instruments
are mostly woodwind, and include the pan-flute, the long japurutu flutes, small cane and
deer-leg-bone flutes, and the Yurupari trumpets; occasionally one sees a small drum.
Gesture is fairly rich, and typically accompanies any narrative; both lip pointing and
index finger pointing are also common. Hup laughter is often shouted out as a loud ‘heyhey-hey!’ especially by women; I have also heard Tukano women do this, and it may be a
more widespread phenomenon.
Most Hupd’´h have several names, as is common among Vaupés Indians. The
first of these is the Hup name, the bi/íd hat ‘blessing name’ or ‘spell name’. This name
is determined by the person’s clan membership; each clan has a relatively small
repertoire of girls’ and boys’ names (amounting to less than a dozen of each) that are
typically applied in a rough order according to the birth order of the children. The Hup
‘spell names’ for the Toucan’s Beak, Jaguar’s Tail, and Hawk Clans are given in Table
1.2.1212Several of these names differ in intriguing ways from normal Hup vocabulary. A few have opposite tone
values (and therefore correspond to the same words in Yuhup), and the meanings of several others are not
known. In the case of the name mçhçy k´/, the word k´/ has no meaning in Hup, but means ‘bone’ in
Yuhup. It seems likely that some of these names preserve archaic features of the language, or perhaps
started out as Yuhup names and entered Hup through intermarriage.","[44, 45]"

Arguably, Hup grammar places a high priority—from a cross-linguistic
perspective—on the linguistic expression and creation of social relationships. The
reasons for this may lie in the Hup cultural and social context. Just as the highly
stratified societies in which Japanese and other East Asian languages are spoken have
given rise to the development of a large number of honorific particles in these languages861(which index relatively perduring social relationships), the cooperative, egalitarian
society of Hup speakers may well have contributed to the development of the
grammaticalized expression of relatively context-dependent social relationships, which
are created and maintained in the context of the activity and the speech event itself. In
Hup society, the Western concept of the individual as an autonomous agent is relatively
foreign; the individual is always conceptualized as part of a larger group. At the same
time, there is relatively little centralized authority within this group. Thus it is
noteworthy if someone is acting alone (~Exclusive -Vyˆ¤k); solicitation and discussion of
cooperation between individuals—especially involving the sharing of food or objects—is
common (~Cooperative -nˆ‡N; inclusive 1pl -Vêh; Applicative -/u‚h-); and individuals and
family units are expected to act on their own initiative in order to maintain their place in a
tightly knit and essentially communal larger group (~Contrastive n’u‡h; ‘Acting alone’
markers -ké/, -d’a‡h). On the other hand, while the structure of Hup society is consistent
with Hup’s grammatical encoding of social connectedness, it is not clear why this
language has developed these forms when so many other languages, spoken in similarly
egalitarian societies, apparently have not. More cross-linguistic work must be done to
establish how common such forms really are among the world’s languages, and what
exactly may motivate their development.","[876, 877, 878]"

Note that, interestingly, Purposive -teg may be grammatical in a negative
adverbial clause, unlike Future -teg (see above):

As a marker of purpose, adverbial -teg is not required to refer anaphorically to an
antecedent in the same sentence. Instead, it may simply refer back to the discourse
context in general; for example, (18) was uttered during a conversation about a kind of
flute that was made in the old days, in response to my question “why did they make the
flutes?”:(18)hˆdhicoco-tég!h ˆdp´‡/=waghˆdhicoco-tég!3plhappy-FUT/PURP3pldabacuri=day3plhappy-FUT/PURP‘In order to be happy! In order to be happy on dabacuri days!’ (H.txt)717‘Purposive’ -teg may also refer directly to the pragmatic speech context, and
often relates to a physical object that is at hand. For example, (19a) might be uttered in
reference to a particular hammock (compare (19b), which could only be interpreted as a
general statement of a future activity). Similarly, example (20) was uttered by my
consultant, who was examining a small plastic animal that I had brought as an elicitation
prop; since he was fully aware that the animal was going to stay in my possession, his
statement could not be interpreted as referring to a future event of playing, only to the
identity of the object.

child=PLplay-FUT/PURP‘(It’s) for kids to play with.’ (OS)
The function of -teg to express purpose is closely related to its use as a future
marker. For an event concurrent with the temporal reference point to have an expressed
purpose, that purpose necessarily involves another event that is anticipated, and which
will occur in the future relative to that reference point. When this temporal reference
point is not concurrent with the speech moment itself, then this ‘future’ is strictly relative,
rather than absolute; the event referred to with -teg may have already occurred prior to
the speech event itself, as in example (15) above, or it may be occurring at the moment of
the speech event, as in example (21), in which -teg expresses both relative future and
purpose/result. On the other hand, expression of purpose or future relative to a future718reference point (as opposed to a past or present reference point) can avoid ambiguity
by use of the Sequential marker -yó/ (see §18.2.6.3), as in example (3) above (i.e. “we’ll
do X; after having done X, we’ll do Y”).","[732, 733, 734, 735]"

Note that the different causative constructions are not usually interchangeable, but
differ in important ways, particularly according to the degree of control. For example,
only g’et- ‘stand’ is grammatical in an expression such as ‘feed a child’ (example 34a),
whereas d’o/- ‘take’ can only be interpreted literally in this context (34b):(34)a)/ãêh tˆh=dó/-a‡n

While the stems described above (d’o/- ‘take’, d’´h- ‘send’, and g’et- ‘stand’) are
by far the most productive in forming causative compounds, the class of causative stems500that can function in these constructions is essentially open. For example, the stem
hu‚h- ‘hold’ is often used in causative constructions involving babies, such as hu‚h-j’çm‘bathe an infant’ (i.e. holding the child in the water of the stream or river; does not entail
that the caregiver also bathes), and hu‚h-/ç‚h- ‘put child to sleep by holding it’ (i.e. by
lying with child in hammock).
Other causative combinations involve initial verbs that do not occur regularly in
causative constructions at all, but form causatives by virtue of their position in the verb
compound and the pragmatic interpretation. Such causative combinations include /eyway- (call-go.out) ‘cause to go out by calling’ (example 35), and b’´h-ham- (pour-go)
‘cause to go away by pouring out’ example (36). Various transitive stems can combine
with the intransitive verb na/- ‘die’ to yield a causative reading (‘cause to die’), such as
g’´ç-na/- ‘cause to die by biting’, hi-g’et-na/- ‘cause to die by stepping on’, as in
example (37), or even the hypothetical key-na/- ‘cause to die by looking at’.

Hup has an additional compounding strategy for forming causative constructions, in
which the intransitive stem describing the resulting event is the first element in the
compound, and is followed by the transitive causative stem. Note, in addition, that in
these compounds it is possible for both stems to be transitive—with two different
objects—as in (40).
Only two causative stems are used productively and regularly in these
constructions: -bˆ/- ‘make, work’ (example 38), and -yQ‚h- ‘order, request, compel’
(examples 39-40). These compounds resemble the relatively less ‘iconic’ constructions
described below in §9.4.2, in that the order of stems does not reflect the order of events.
Even though the causative force is usually initiated before the resulting state is attained,
the stems occur in the opposite order.","[516, 517, 518]"

On the other hand, certain tense, aspect, and mode specifications are not possible
within the negated verb word. Negative -nˆ¤h (itself having an ambiguous identity as
either Boundary or Inner Suffix, depending on what other formatives are present) cannot
co-occur with certain Boundary Suffixes. In particular, it is ungrammatical in
combination with Dynamic -Vêy and Declarative -Vêh (except in certain cases of clausecombining, see §18.1.2). It is likewise ungrammatical with Sequential -yó/ (a Boundary885Suffix), and an auxiliary construction with ni- ‘be’ is required in order to convey a
sequential negative event:
(30)wˆ/-nˆ¤hni-yó//ˆnb’ay-té-ay-áhhear-NEGbe-SEQ1plreturn-FUT-INCH-DECL‘Having understood nothing, we’d return.’ (B.Cv1.82)
Verbal negation is ungrammatical in the Apprehensive mood (see §14.6), and it also does
not co-occur with the Counterfactual marker -tQ‚/—presumably because the irrealis
nature of this morpheme gives it an inherently negative quality (see §14.2 and §16.4
below).
Finally, the Verbal Negative suffix -nˆ¤h is ungrammatical with the Future suffixes
-teg / -te- (although it can occur with -teg when this suffix acts as a purpose marker in a
dependent clause, as in example 13b above; see §13.1). This apparently idiosyncratic
aspect of Hup grammar probably has a historical explanation relating to the nominal
origin of these future suffixes, as discussed in the Historical Note in §13.1. In order to
express a negative future event, Hup relies on two alternative constructions. The most
common involves the Inchoative marker -ay, as in (31) (but note that this combination
can in some cases be used for a current, on-going event, so its future reading is implied
rather than entailed). The Future Contrast particle tán provides a second option for
expressing negative future, as in example (32).","[901, 902]"

In the noun phrase, numerals can occur both as nominal modifiers and as nominal
heads. As modifiers, they typically precede the noun, as do demonstratives (while
adjective modifiers follow the noun); in this case, the numeral is usually unstressed,
while the noun gets the primary stress of the NP, usually recognized as rising tone
(whatever the underlying tone of the noun)97. The alternative order (N-Numeral) is also
possible, but is much less common. The occurrence of numerals in the noun phrase is
illustrated in examples (80-83).","[410, 411]"

In general, all nominal constituents of the main clause can be questioned, whether
they are core or peripheral, as can heads within nouns phrases. For example, while (114)

boxQ-NMZcug’Q‡tní-i/paperbe-INT(Intended meaning: ‘Where in relation to the box is the book?’)
Questions in Hup can involve embedding. For instance, a question word can
occur in a subordinate clause, embedded within an interrogative main clause:
(117) hˆ‚ê-n’ˆ‡h
Q-NMZkéy-ep /am yé-e/ ?
see-DEP 2sgenter-INT‘What did you come in for?’ (lit. ‘what did you come in to see’) (OS)
Also, in quoted speech (see §18.2.1), an interrogative clause can itself be embedded
within a declarative main clause:

The speaker, a teenaged girl from Barreira, uses the verb g’ç‚h- ‘be’ here instead of ni-, in joking
imitation of the Vaupés dialect.
192944As discussed in §6.2, the interrogative particle hˆ‚ (like Hup’s demonstratives)
occurs as a quasi-free particle when followed by the verbs nç- ‘say’ and nˆh- ‘be like’
whereas in all other contexts it is obligatorily inflected. Interrogative clauses formed
with hˆ) plus ‘say’ or ‘be like’ are irregular syntactically, as well as morphologically—the
clause is subject-final, as is typical of the polar interrogative subtype (see below), despite
the fact that this is a content question (examples 119-20). This non-canonical constituent
order is probably due to the fact that hˆ) is essentially inflected by the verb itself and is
therefore morphosyntactically bound to it; although certain bound morphemes can come
between hˆ) and the verb stem ‘say’ or ‘be like’, the subject of the clause cannot and is
therefore unable to precede the verb in the clause.

Finally, Focus -áh occurs in one other context involving a clause-final affect
marker, but here its distribution is somewhat different from the cases described above. In
this construction, rather than marking a focused argument elsewhere in the clause, -áh
always immediately precedes a clause-final nominal argument that is marked as a topic
by the Dependent marker -Vp (cf. §7.1.5) (note -Vp also acts as a clausal subordinator;
see §18.2.4.1). The Focus marker -áh usually falls on the immediately preceding
predicate of the clause, and the resulting construction as a whole is relatively emphatic
(see §7.1.5). Note that in a more neutral affirmation, subject-final constituent order in the
clause typically requires the Declarative marker -Vêh instead of the Dependent marker,
and the preceding predicate has no special marking.

The so-called ‘Filler’ syllable -Vw- is perhaps the most neutral morpheme in Hup, in
terms of carrying a particular semantics. It appears in a number of distinct contexts: it
appears to play a role in clause linkage and subordination, as discussed in §18.1.2 and
§18.2.3 (see also below); in other contexts the main role of -Vw- appears to be one of
conveying emphasis, which corresponds to and is perhaps even iconically motivated by
the phonological weight the Filler syllable adds to the word. The connection between
these various uses, and the motivation for the Filler syllable in some of these contexts, is
not yet fully understood; however, certain other mechanisms used in signaling clausal
linkage—most notably the Dependent marker -Vp (see §7.1.5 and §18.2.4)—are also
used as discourse-markers on main clauses, so this dual-duty is not unique to the Filler
syllable. This section focuses on its use as an emphasis marker in main clauses.
Formally, Filler -Vw- is limited to contexts preceding a vowel-initial Boundary
Suffix, and is the only case in Hup of a vowel-initial form that is not itself a Boundary
Suffix. Its function is in many cases largely determined by that of the vowel-initial suffix
that follows it. Filler -Vw- tends to occur on a clause-final constituent, but can appear
both clause-internally and clause-finally in a single clause.
Filler -Vw- frequently occurs with clause-final nominal arguments (subjects or
objects), followed by Declarative -Vêh or the Dependent marker suffix -Vp (which here
serves an emphasis-related function), or (particularly in the case of demonstrative
pronouns) by a case-marker (Object -a‡n or Oblique -Vêt). In this context, -Vw—which is
purely optional—functions to place additional emphasis on the participant in question.","[846, 847, 848]"
