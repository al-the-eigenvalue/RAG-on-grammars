"2The Noun Phrase22310.3 ATTRIBUTES
10.3.1 Overview of the Structure of NPs with Attributes
Attributes are defined as modifying constituents within the noun phrase, except for
the determiner(s). Attributes can be classified as follows:
(1) Pre-head attributes:
(i) the restrictive adverb roki 'just'.
(ii) the restrictive adverb me eng 'exactly, right'.
(iii) local-directional (LD) nouns.
(iv) absolutive noun phrases which are the expansions of the 3rd person Possessors of non-reciprocal kinship terms, or nouns which are cross-referenced
by the bound demonstrative of reciprocal kinship terms.
(v) nouns, usually with the purposive suffix, which modify local nouns denoting
positions.
All the five types of pre-head attributes can potentially cooccur in this order (roki occurs
before the determiner, and all the others after the determiner).
(2) Post-head attributes:
(i) nouns/pronouns in juxtaposition to the heads.(ii) local noun phrases in ergative or ablative case.
(iii) adjectives and adjectival participles.
(iv) classifier constructions and numerals.
(v) relative clauses which require a 3rd person possessive pronoun as a relative
pronoun.
All the five types of post-head attributes can potentially cooccur. The order of (ii), (iii)
and (iv) are variable. Post-head relative clauses are usually placed after them.
(3) Attributes which can be placed in either position:
(i) the restrictive adverb nang 'only'.
(ii) the numeral noi 'one/some/any'.
(iii) the quantifier tu'ki 'all'.
(iv) Possessors and local nouns with gender suffixes.
(v) Possessor nouns/pronouns with the ergative suffix.
(vi) relative clauses without relative pronouns.
Classifier constructions, noi and tu 'ki cannot cooccur. Two Possessors or two relative224Chapter 10clauses cannot cooccur. The restrictive adverb nang does not occur with meeng but it
can occur with raki.
Motuna places NP attributes, either in pre-head or post-head positions, primarily
according to their pragmatic functions. Pre-head attributes are used to identify the
entities referred to by the heads; post-head attributes, on the other hand, describe their
characteristics. Schematically,
Diagram 10-2aMajor Functions of NP AttributesPre-head AttributesNP-------Head
Post-head Attributes<--Identification--><-- Description -->The relative order of pre-head attributes is fixed. Among them, those which give
more specific information for identification (such as possessive pronouns, Possessor
noun phrases or nouns, nouns which modify local nouns of positions, or pre-head
relative clauses), are placed closer to the heads, while those which give more general
information, such as LD nouns and restrictive adverbs, are placed farther away. 3

IDENTIFICATION<- general informationspecific information ->3 Seiler (1978: 309) summarises the sequential order of modifying elements in the noun phrase (whichhe calls ""determiners"") in High German as follows:
""The potential of a determiner D for singling out the object referred to by the head noun N
increases proportionally with the positional distance ofD from N.""
According to Mosel (1984: 27-28), the order of pre-head NP modifiers in Tolai is governed by the same
principle.
Motuna distinguishes ""identification"" and ""description"" as two separate parameters, and within each
parameter there seems to be a continuum, which is reflected in the positional distance of modifiers from
the head. The order of the pre-head modifiers which ""identity' the entity referred to by the head seems to
be governed by Seiler's principle. But that of the post-head modifiers which ""describe"" it seems to be
governed by more complex principles, as discussed below.","[251, 252, 253]"
"Core case markings are ergative/absolutive. In addition, there are five more cases--comitative, purposive, locative, ablative and similative. Motuna has no prepositions or
postpositions. Verbs, kinship terms, classifiers and numerals show extremely complex
morphology, with both suffixing and prefixing.
The phoneme inventory of Motuna is relatively simple. It has five vowel phonemes.
Stop and nasal phonemes are distinguished in three places of articulation. In addition,
there are two fricatives and glides, and a rhotic. The most interesting part of the
phonology of Motuna is the three archi-consonants which are ""underspecified"" as
regards the places of articulation, and which always occupy the coda position in the

Gospeli Maka, 1952) and the Gospel of Matthew (So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung, 1968). The
latter was translated by Pamela Beaumont.
34Chapter 1syllable. The alternations of CV syllables and these archi-consonants under specific
morphological environments constitute the core of the complex morphophonemics of
Motuna.
Word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors.
In a verbal clause, an NP, usually in absolutive case, which provides ""given"" 4
information occupies the first position, and the verb the last position. SV, OAV and
AOV 5 are commonly found constituent orders in my corpus. The first core or local
NP in absolutive case tends to be a sentential topic. (If A is a topic, it is not marked by
ergative case.) However, core NPs are often left unexpressed if understood from the
context, because they are obligatorily cross-referenced on the verb. Furthermore, any
NP which provides ""new"" information can be placed after the verb.
The basic order of major NP constituents is:
Determiner (Article/Demonstrative)+ Local Noun+ NP Head
NP Head + Adjective + Classifier/Numeral/Quantifier
Motuna distinguishes kinship, classifier, and other possessive constructions. The
first two types of possessive constructions are basically head-marking, and the last type
dependent-marking. Possessors in kinship and classifier possessive constructions are
always placed before the head, while those in other possessive constructions can
occupy either pre-head or post-head positions.
Relative clauses can also occupy pre-head or post-head positions. Motuna has
internal relative clauses as well.
A gender system and classifiers coexist in Motuna. Five genders --- masculine,
feminine, dimunitive, local and, marginally, manner --- are distinguished in singular
nouns, but these distinctions are neutralised in nonsingular number. 6 They are
obligatorily cross-referenced by modifiers within the same NP and/or by the predicate.
In addition, most nouns are classified into fifty-one semantic types, which can be
indicated by classifiers modifying them. Nouns distinguish four numbers--- singular,
dual, paucal and plural.
Personal pronouns distinguish singular and nonsingular number. In 1st person
4The terms ""given"" and ""new"" information are according to Chafe (1976).","[32, 33]"

topic. (2) is used instead of (1) when A provides given information. The 0 NP, or the
A NP in ergative case, can be placed after the verb, when they provide new information
in the discourse. 15
In addition to core arguments, many transitive verbs can take NPs in absolutive case,
verbal nouns, verbal clauses with verbs in Definite Future TAM, or sentences in
quotation, as Complements. Examples of absolutive NPs functioning as the Complements of transitive verbs are given below (see §14.3.2.1, §14.5 and §14.6 for the
examples of different types of Complements):

Note that the verb stem nep-ee- in 3-66 is derived by the applicative suffix -(j)ee. It
introduces a new 0 argument (Koimeke) and moves the original 0 (hoo ko'sa) into
Complement status. (See also 3-24. See Ch 14 for a detailed discussion of valencychanging processes.)14Unless another absolutive NP denoting location precedes and functions as a topic. e.g. 3-15.","[89, 90]"
"Since the person and number of A and 0 NPs are obligatorily cross-referenced, in
many cases A and/or 0 NPs can be left unexpressed without confusion. Thus the basic
· word order and case-markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses are:13 In other words, the ergative suffix marks the A argument which is not a sentential topic. In
elicitation sessions, my informants sometimes marginally accepted sentences in which A NPs in
ergative case are sentential topics at the same time. But I have found no such sentence in my entire
corpus of narratives and daily conversation. This fits Wierzbicka's argument that 'the ergative marks
the peripheral (less topical) actant' ( 1981: 69).",[89]

five types of cross-referencing marking (0/A, S0 , SA and irregular markings in active
voice, and middle suffixes in middle voice). Verb forms, in tum, may take:
(1) core noun phrases, which are obligatorily cross-referenced,
(2) Complements, which are not cross-referenced but are nevertheless syntactically
obligatory, and
(3) peripheral arguments, which are syntactically optional.
Transitive verb forms (hence transitive verbs) require two core arguments (0 and A),
while intransit~ve verb forms (hence intransitive verbs) require only one (S). Transitive
verbs may further take one or two Complements (Cs), and intransitive verbs may take
one. Thus, as far as the number of obligatory participants are concerned, a verb form
can have one or more of the five types of valency below: 1
Intransitive verbs:
one-place
two-places
scv
vTransitive verbs:
two-place0Athree-place0Acfour-place0Accv
v
vNote that A NPs can be in ergative or absolutive case, while 0 NPs are always in
absolutive case.
This chapter is organised as follows:1 The order of NP constituents and verbs given here is the unmarked one, although almost anyconstituents can be placed in different order or be left unexpressed, due to discourse factors. Specifically, the order of 0, A and Vis discussed in §3.3.1.1.","[423, 424, 425, 426]"

A (Actor)
'... Perui (Topic) was killed by Paanaangah.' (VII-57)
As mentioned in §3.2.1, I use the symbol 0 and A, to indicate the grammatical
functions of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses, which play the roles of the Undergoer and the Actor respectively. In Motuna, 0 is always denoted by an absolutive noun
phrase, but A can be denoted either by an ergative or absolutive noun phrase. When A
is a sentential topic, it must be denoted by an absolutive NP. 13
When A is in ergative case, word order is free. However, when A is in absolutive
case, A must precede 0. For example, in 3-63, the 0 NP in absolutive case (tii Perui)
and the A NP in ergative case (ho-i Paanaangah) are interchangeable, but not the two
NPs in absolutive case in the following sentence:

As is seen in 4-80, proper names can be determined by the article and/or the demonstrative. Furthermore, those in local gender often take attributes such as LD nouns,
possessive pronouns, etc. For example, the proper (place) name Aaru in the following
example is determined by the article and the demonstrative in local gender, and is
further modified by two LD nouns raang 'north' and koto 'up':
4-81... tiiowoART.L DEM.LraangkotoAalumi-i-na.northup'place.name'go.lS-RMPAST-F'... I went to Alu up in the north.' (XV-39)
As is shown in 4-81, place names are usually treated as local nouns by themselves.
In some cases, however, the derivational suffix -kori (or its allomorph -ngori or -jori,
cf. §4.6.1) is attached to them, in order to clearly indicate their local gender. For
example:
4-82... tii
ART.LMaato-ngoriuwi-ro ...'river.name'-Lgo.3pcl.S-PERF.SS'... they went to (the River) Maato, and (they) .. .' (XXIII-4)
Local nouns derived by the suffix -kori may be lexicalised as place names. For
example, the village from which one of my informants comes is called Kaakoto-kori
'white-L [lit. white-place]'. 154. 4. 4. Kinship Terms
There are two kinds of kinship terms:

criteria:
(1) Major Word Classes
(i) Noun (cf. Ch 4)
(ii) Adjective (cf. Ch 7)
(iii) Verb (cf. Ch 12)
(iv) Participle (cf. Ch 16)
(2) Minor Word Classes
(i) Pronoun (cf. Ch 5)
(ii) Article (cf. Ch 6)
(iii) Demonstrative (cf. Ch 6)
(iv) Classifier (cf. Ch 8)
(v) Numeral (cf. Ch 8)
(vi) Quantifier (cf. Ch 8)
(vii) Adverb (cf. Ch 7)
(viii) Discourse Marker (cf. Ch 9)
(ix) Negator (cf. Ch 9)
(x) Conjuncion (cf. Ch 9)
(xi) Interjection (cf. Ch 9)
Verbal nouns --- a subclass of nouns --- are discussed in Ch 16.
The words which belong to major word classes primarily function as the heads of
phrases (noun phrases, adjective phrases, verb phrases, and participle phrases, respectively). Phrases are syntactic units which constitute clauses (cf. §3.2).~inor
word classes -at~t,
1\all the others. Some of them function as substitutes for,or modifiers of, major syntactic units. Others carry out various syntactic and pragmatic
functions.
Motuna is predominantly an agglutinative language. It is often the case that a word
contains one or more bound morphemes. In addition, there are various types of40Chapter 3compounds and syntactic constructions. For example, kinship terms and classifiers are
bound lexical roots, which are combined with various bound morphemes and/or
words.
The major word classes are characterised as follows:
(1) Nouns have five genders in singular number--- masculine, feminine, dimunitive,local and, marginally, manner. Gender distinction is neutralised in nonsingular
number. The gender of a noun is cross-referenced by the modifiers within the
same noun phrase and/or by the predicate. In addition, most nouns can be modified by classifiers, which relate to their semantic types.
Nouns distinguish four numbers--- singular, dual, paucal and plural. Norwingular numbers may be marked on nouns by suffixes. The number of a noun may
also be cross-referenced on the predicate, if it is the head of an argument NP.
As the heads of noun phrases, nouns can be determined by the article and/or the
demonstrative, and can take modifiers of various types, e.g. nouns, adjectives,
classifiers, possessors, relative clauses, numerals, a quantifier, etc. Noun phrases
fulfill various syntactic functions in different types of clauses. See §3.2.2.
(2) Adjectives can also be marked by number suffixes, in agreement with the head
nouns they modify or the arguments they predicate. Some adjectives marginally
show gender inflections.
(3) Verbs are typically marked by morphemes which cross-reference the person/number
of the core arguments, and by tense/aspect/mood (TAM) suffixes. Fully inflected
non-medial verbs are further marked by the suffixes which cross-reference the
genders of the sentential topics. Medial verbs, on the other hand, are marked by
switch-reference morphemes.
Verbs usually function as the heads of verb phrases. 1 Verb phrases, in turn,
function as the predicates of verbal clauses.
(4) Participles are derived from verb stems by the derivational suffix -(w)ah. Morpho
logically all the participles can take number suffixes like adjectives. Syntactically
some participles behave like adjectives in that they do not take argument NPs,
while others behave like verbs in that they take argument NPs. Mainly due to thisMedial verbs may be combined with aspectual verbs to constitute verb phrases. In such cases, the
latter function as heads. cf. § 15.5.
1Syntactic Preview41difference of syntactic behaviour, 2 they are classified into ""adjectival participles""
and ""verbal participles"".
Some lexical words have dual or triple membership in different word classes. For
example, meeng functions as an adjective with masculine gender inflection in the sense
of 'real', as a restrictive adverb in the sense of 'exactly, right', or as an emphatic
adverb in the sense of 'very'. In such cases, I register them in all the word classes in
which they have membership.
Some lexical phrases are also described in the corresponding word classes. (For
example, numerals above six in analytical constructions.) On the other hand, two
suffixes, -ko and -nno, are discussed inCh 9, together with other words belonging to
minor word classes, since their syntactic behaviour is like that of a discourse marker
and a conjunction, respectively.","[67, 68, 69, 70]"
"6Introduction5nonsingular there is also an inclusive/exclusive distinction (the Pouko dialect lacks this
distinction, cf. § 1.2). There is no 3rd person free pronoun, and the article and the
demonstrative are used as deictic/anaphoric pronouns instead.
The verbal morphology of Motuna is extremely complex. All the verbs mark the
person and number of core argument(s)- S, in the case of intransitive verbs, and 0 and
A, in the case of transitive verbs. They also distinguish active and middle voices,
similar to those found in classical Indo-Aryan languages. 7 A periphrastic agentless
passive construction is formed by participles and the auxiliary 'to become', which""is
mainly used when the speaker addresses or refers to someone in a special kin relation.
Similar to many other Papuan languages, Motuna has ""medial"" verbs which usually
occupy sentence-medial positions and are marked by switch-reference morphemes.
The endings of fully inflected ""non-medial"" verbs, on the other hand, mark the gender
of the topical argument of the sentence.
Motuna has an extensive tense/aspect/mood system. Non-medial verbs distinguish
fourteen tense/aspect/mood categories, while medial verbs distinguish three for the
same subject forms, and two for the different subject forms.
As for derivational morphology, verb stems may undergo four valency-changing
processes--- stimulative, applicative, causative and reciprocal. They can also derive
verbal nouns and participles.
Clause coordination is mainly achieved by chaining medial verbs. Medial verbs, by
their tense/aspect and switch-reference suffixes, track the themes of the whole discourse. Thematic coherence is further maintained by a rich array of conjunctions and
discourse markers. Due to these pragmatic factors, it is not sufficient to choose the
sentence as the linguistic unit of description, in the case of this language.","[33, 34]"
"The Noun Phrase225The order of post-head attributes are variable, but they seem to be arranged according
to the following principles:
( 1) The one which expresses a category more inherent to the entity referred to by the
head noun tends to be placed closer to the head. On the other hand, the one which
gives descriptive details tends to be placed farther away. (Thus nouns or adjectives which denote inherent characteristics are placed next to the heads, while
relative clauses are usually placed farther away.)
(2) The one which gives given information tends to be placed nearer to the head, while
the one which gives new information tends to be placed farther away from the
head.
(3) Among those which give new information, the one which expresses more important
information in that particular context tends to be placed nearer to the head.
Some examples of noun phrases with attributes are given below. (NP heads are
underlined.)
the adjective honna 'big', and the numeral classifier na-waki 'a carrier', after the head
aru=aru 'basket':
10-18hoo-joriaru=aruhonnana-wakiART.M-LOCcane.basketbigone-CL.carrier'in a big cane basket' (I-11)
the locational-directional (LD) noun ngoho 'somewhere down', and the noun moo
'coconut tree' with the purposive suffix, before the head local noun u 'wah-no 'bottom
part':
10-19tiiowongohomoo-koART.LDEM.Lsomewhere.downcoconut-PURPu 'wah-no
base-L'there somewhere down around the bottom part (of the trunk) of the coconut

the adjective honna 'big', and the relative clause kaara konna-mong'cars run', after the
head monare 'road':

'big' after, the head sikuulu 'school':
10-21kuraisapeeka-ngsikuuluhannawomen3nonsg.POSS-Mschoolbig'a girls' big school(= high school)' (II-30)
the adjective kuraisa 'female', the local article in ergative case ti-ki 'there', and thebahuvrihi compound with a numeral nii-nna kara=kara nai 'who have one language . 'J
with me' (cf. §8.2.2.1.1), the numeral classifier kari-mangu 'four humans', after the
head kitari 'child'. The adjective kuraisa and the compound nii-nna kara=kara nai are
marked by the plural suffix -ngung, and the numeral classifier kari-mangu is marked
by the comitative case suffix -nna. These suffixes indicate the number and the case of
the whole NP.

one]-plkari-mangu-nna
four-CL.human.pcl-COMIT'with four female children there who speak the same language as mine'
(XVI-1)
As seen in 10-22, if a nonsingular noun is the head of a noun phrase with attributes,
attributes such as possessive pronouns, adjectives and relative clauses may be marked
by a number suffix. 4 Another example where the plural suffix -ngung is attached to
both the head and a relative participle clause:
10-23haanammai-ngungART.Mperson-piuri-ngituh-ah-ngungREL[village-ERGbe-PART]-pl'the people who live in the village' (XIII-30)
A case suffix is obligatorily attached to the determiner if there is one. In addition, it
may also be attached to the head and attributes. If the NP is without determiner, it is
obligatorily attached to the last attribute, and optionally to the head and other attributes.","[253, 254, 255]"
"Preview of Verbs25712.2 MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF VERBS
12.2.1 Verb Stems
Verb stems are either underived or derived.
Underived stems may be purely verbal, or may be roots which are not categorised
for noun/verb or adjective/verb distinction. Some stems are loan words from English
or Tok Pisin. There are also compound stems. See § 12.4 for further discussion.
Derived verb stems may be (1) non-reciprocal or (2) reciprocal.
(1) Derived non-reciprocal stems are formed by attaching one to three valency-changingsuffixes (stimulative, causative, and/or applicative, in this order) to underived verb
stems.
Diagram 12-laStructure of Derived Non-Reciprocal Verb StemDerived Stem
Underived Stem- (Stimulative Suffix)- (Causative Suffix)- (Applicative Suffix)The forms and functions of valency-changing suffixes are roughly as follows:
(i) the stimulative suffix -sii(h)- is attached to intransitive verb stems which denote
subjective feelings or emotive actions. The stimulative suffix demotes the original
S which refers to the Experiencer, and promotes the Stimulus of such experience
to S status. (cf. 12-1b)
(ii) the causative suffix -(w )ooto- is attached to intransitive verb stems. 4 It introduces
a new A argument. (cf. 12-1c and 12-2b)
(iii) the applicative suffix -(j)ee- is attached to any verb stems. In most cases it intro
duces a new Undergoer argument (0, C, or S) or a Possessor. 5 (cf. 12-1d,
12-2c and 12-4a.)It can be attached to verb stems which take both active voice (transitive) and middle voice (intransitive) suffixes. However, I will argue in §14.5.2. that the causative suffix allows only the latter
(intransitive) readings in such cases.","[285, 286]"
"§ 17 .1. Although ""same/different theme"" are more appropriate labels than ""same/different subject"" formedial verbal endings, I use the latter terminology in this thesis, following the convention of the
grammatical description of Papuan languages.

In active voice, verbs cross-reference one or two core argument NPs. The verbs
which take only one core argument (S), such as /siiho-/ 'to become/be ill', /kumar-/ 'to
laugh', and /pi(h)-/ 'to go', are intransitive verbs. On the other hand, those with two
core arguments (0 and A), such as /ngo-/ 'to make/do sth, to do (sth) to sb', /to-/ 'to
hit/kill sb/sth', /o-1 'to give (sth) to sb', /nai-/ 'to show (sth) to sb', are transitive
verbs. 20
All the transitive verbs are marked by a set of pronominal suffixes, which usually
consist of an 0 suffix, an A suffix, and a number suffix, in that order. See the following example:
/mono-/ 'to see/look at' as a transitive verb (cf. 12-5. The dual suffix is fused with the
following Near Past suffix):
12-17nonineeus.excit.must.be ART.M-ERG 'demon's.name'ho-iHangingmono-m-u-h-ni.
see-10-3A-dl.NRPAST-DP[ 0 ]
A
'... Honging must have seen us two.' (XII-9)20There are, however, cases where we cannot decide the transitivity of particular verb stems simply in
terms of cross-referencing markings. See § 14.2.","[294, 295]"
"Phonology29Examples of compounds:
roki=manni'certainly' (derived from the adverb roki 'just'
and the discourse marker manni 'certainly')Krismas=maaritah'Christmas holidays' (derived from the loan
noun Kirismas 'Christmas' and the derived
noun maarit=ah 'holidays')muu=riih-arei'to get dark' (derived from muu 'night' and
riih-arei 'to become (verbal noun)'kuma=kuma=nong=nga-wah'giggler' (derived from kuma=kuma 'laugh',
nong 'only' and nga-wah 'made (participle)')Syntactic constructions, on the other hand, are not lexical units. Their meanings are
predictable from the meanings of the c!{amrnatical) words in particular syntactic configurations. Examples:
nii-nnokoro=koronoi-ngung[me-COMITlanguageone]-pl'(those) who have one language with me'
hookongsi'haaro'-ki-no-mori[ART.Mmangofall.3S-HABPAST]-LINK-CL.season'the season when mangoes fall'
The first example above is a so-called bahuvrihi compound with the numeral noi,
incorporating its NP argument (cf. §7.1.3 and §8.2.2.1.1). Three grammatical words,
nii-nno, koro=koro and noi-ngung, constitute a single grammatical unit. The secondexample is a classifier construction, in which the classifier -mori is combined with an
intransitive verb with its S argument via the linker -no- (cf. §8.1.3 .2.5). Here again,
three grammatical words, hoo, kongsi' and haaro'-ki-no-mori, constitute a single
grammatical unit. I will hereafter associate such grammatical units by square brackets
in the interlinear text, as is shown in the above examples.","[57, 58]"
"CONT.DSThe suffix marked by * may be preceded by the negative infix /-woo-/.
The Imperative suffix is usually realised as -o, but it is irregular especially after the
paucallplural number suffix 1-ru/.
The list of gender suffixes, given in Table 12-4, is repeated below:

-ee, and is realised as -ni elsewhere. It is deleted after a Nil sequence in Near Past and
Imaginative. cf. Rule 13-11 in §13.2.1.15.
In this chapter, I will discuss the paradigms of verbs in the following order:
(1) In§ 13.2, I will discuss the paradigms of cross-referencing S markings of intransi-tive verbs, in combination with the negative infix, TAM suffixes, and gender or
switch-reference markings. I will discuss the paradigm of S0 verbs ( § 13 .2.1), SA
verbs (§13.2.2), irregular verbs (§13.2.3), and middle verbs (§13.2.4) in tum. In
§ 13.2.5, the cross-referencing markings of intransitive verbs of all types are
summarised.
(2) In §13.3, the paradigms of transitive verbs are discussed and summarised in the
same way as above.
(3) In § 13.4, all verb stems are categorised according to their phonological shapes. I
will discuss the morphophonemic processes, which affect them when they are
combined with cross-referencing markings.","[313, 314]"
"In Motuna, the back vowel /o/ is most commonly used among the five vowels, and is also
phonologically the most neutral one (cf. §2.3 below). The back stop lk/ is also the commonest
non-nasal stop in Motuna. (Among the non-nasal stops used in three texts chosen at random, lk/
accounts for 55%, while It! and /p/ account for 29% and 16% respectively.) These facts seem to suggest
that the tongue position in articulation is predominantly in the back in Motuna.
Among nasals (before vowels), the coronal In! is most commonly used, and the back /ng/ least.
However, if we regard that the archinasal is essentially a back nasal, this order of frequency is reversed.
According to Gasaway (1987b), m, nand ng alternate word-finally. In her data, the speakers of the
Pouko dialect usually use n, while those in other dialects of Motuna use either m or ng. All my
infomants (including the one who speaks the Pouko dialect), however, consistently use ng in word
final position, except for the environments described below where m is used.

The phoneme /w/ is realised as [{3] before Iii. When it is preceded by an archinasal,

observation, the informant and her children from Panakei village tend to pronounce lrl
with a relatively strong trill, while the informants from Kaakotokori and Huyoono
village tend to pronounce [r] or [d] more frequently. I am not sure whether this reflects
regional difference or not.","[44, 45, 46]"
"10.2 SIMPLE NP STRUCTURE
The head of a noun phrase may be determined by an article and/or a demonstrative,
and may take attributes such as adjectives, nouns, classifier constructions, numerals,
Possessors, relative clauses, etc.
Within the NP, the gender of the NP head is cross-referenced by the inflection of the
determiner(s), or by suffixes on various attributes. cf. §4.2.1.
The number of the head, on the other hand, is indicated by a number suffix on the
noun itself or on the attributes. cf. §4.2.2.
The noun phrase without determiner and attributes shows the following structure:

nommai'a person/people'personbnommai-ngi'by a person/people'person-ERGcnommai-ngung-ngi
person-pi-ERG'by many people'The Noun Phrase221As discussed inCh 3, case suffixes indicate the syntactic functions of noun phrases.
Note that the absence of a case suffix (as in 10-7a) also indicates a specific syntactic
function the noun phrase fulfills --- such as the argument of an adjectival clause in
10-1, the A topic and the 0 of a transitive verbal clause as in 10-3, the S of an intransitive verbal clause as in 10-5, etc.
When the noun phrase is determined by an article or a demonstraive, a case suffix is
attached to the determiner. A number suffix may be attached to the head (and its
attributes, cf. § 10.3.1), but never to the determiner.

nee'O.K.?, we (inclusive)'(*ne)There are, however, reasons to assume that sequences of two identical vowels in
some open disyllabic words underlyingly constitute just single vowels.
In Motuna, the article and most personal pronouns have CVV forms when they are in
absolutive case. However, when they take the ergative suffix /-ki/, some of them retain
the original two identical vowels, while others take single ones. For example,
in absolutive case
Iin ergative casenum-ngl'we (inc)'neenee-ki'you (sg)'rooro-ki'you (nonsg)'reeree-ki'who'jXl£lpa-i'ART (M)'hoo- saoho-i- so-i'ART (F/DIM/DP)'tiitii-ngi'ART (L)'tiiti-kiIIThe last two examples are particularly interesting. The article in feminine, dimunitive
or dual-paucal gender has the same form as that in local gender, in absolutive case.
However, their forms are different in ergative case.
In the above cases, morphological analysis will be simpler if we assume that the
difference of surface vowel length in ergative case comes from that of the underlying20Chapter 2vowel length, i.e.: 16
underlying forms
Iin absolutive case/nilnii'we (inc)'/nee/nee'you (sg)'fro/roo'you (nonsg)'/reelree'who'/palpaa'ART (M)'/ho- so/hoo- sao'ART (F/DIM/DP)'/tiiltii'ART (L)'/tiltiiIIThe following phonological rule forces the underlying vowels of open mono-syllabic
words to surface as a sequence of two identical vowels:
Rule 2-7Vowel Lengthening of Underlying Open Mono-syllabic Wordsvi -> vyi 1 #(C) _ #
In addition to sequences of two identical vowels mentioned above, Motuna allows
many types of sequences of two or more vowels. All the combinations attested so far
are given below:
1) Sequences of two vowels (include all the sequences which end with /if, lui and /a/):/ail, /ui/, /ei/, /oil
/au/, !iu/, /eu/, lou/
lial, !ual, leal, loaf/io/16There are other pieces of evidence which support this assumption:( 1) all singular personal pronouns, in their bound forms, take short vowels, while nonsingular
pronouns take long vowels. This applies to possessive and reflexive pronouns as well. cf. Tables 4-7,
5-3 and 5-4.
(2) When the emphatic suffix /-ko/ is attached, only the vowel of the masculine form of the article, hoo
-sao, can optionally be shortened (cf. §9.3).
As regards other mono-syllabic words with long vowels, there are no reason to assume that they
have different underlying forms, since the forms with short vowels never occur. They include:
maa 'faeces', haa 'thing, I wonder', mii 'name, knee, before I have gone',jii 'and', tuu
'water', kuu 'inside', nee 'O.K.?', noo 'possibly'Phonology212) Sequences of three vowels (the sequences which end with /i/ frequently occur in
verbal forms, but others are found only in a few words):
/aai/, /uuil, /eei/, /ooi/
/aau/, liau/
/aia/, /uia/, /eua/
/aio/, /uio/, /oio/, /iuo/, /uuo/
3) Sequences of four vowels (rare):/aaui/, /eeui/, liaai/, liuai/,
/aauu/, /eeuu/
/uiaa/
/aioo/
/aiee/, /uiee/

2.4.1 Syllable Structure
The syllable structure of Motuna is represented as:
Diagram 2-6Syllable Structure(j'0/IRI~ CN
IvIC 1 can be any consonant except /HI, /Q/ and IN/. C 2 can be either /HI, /Q/ or IN/.
As we have seen in §2.3, all vowel sequences are analysed as sequences of single
vowels, which constitute the nuclei of separate syllables.
C 2 consonants are not followed by a vowel. 17 Now, the underlying forms of some
suffixes may have an archinasal at the beginning. 1 8 When such a suffix is attached to a
word ending with a C 2 , 19 C 2 must be ""articulated"" to a C 1V sequence, in order to avoid
an unperrnissible C 2 N sequence. cf. §2.7.3.
17The interjections ehe'ehee 'hi, hi, hi (imitation of laughter)', u'uung 'yes', he'ee 'no' and hu'uung
'no' are exceptions. The glottal stop /Q/ is directly followed by the vowel /e/ and /u/ in these words.
cf. §9.5.
18 I allow sequences, which are not permissible in surface syllable structure, in the underlying forms
of bound morphemes. For example, many verb roots end with consonants which can not occur in coda
position. e.g. /kuuk-/ 'to know', /hoHk-/ 'to throw sth towards sb', /tokis-/ 'to cut'.
19There are no suffixes which begin with /HI or /Q/.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"

'She died.' (VII-45)
Absolutive or similative NPs, APs, PartPs, verbal nouns, Definite Future verbal
clauses, or sentences in quotation, can function as the Complements of certain intransitive verbal clauses. (cf. 3-8, 3-21 and 3-60. See also §14.3.1 and §14.3.2.2.)

'He wants to see you.' (1-21, cf. 14-14a)Syntactic Preview3.3.263Nominal ClausesA nominal clause consists of two noun phrases, which function as the argument and
the predicate in this order. 16
The argument NP is always in absolutive case, and the predicate NP is either in
absolutive case, or a Possessor or a local noun with a gender suffix. Predicate NPs are
usually without determiner. 17
Semantically, nominal clauses can be classified into (1) ""equational"", (2) ""possessive"" and (3) ""local"" clauses. Nominal clauses with verbal nouns as predicates are
discussed separately inCh 16.
( 1) In an ""equational"" nominal clause, the referent of the argument NP has a certain
identity or quality referred to by the predicate. I repeat 3-3 and 3-10 here as examples:
3-73ree-mopoko-ngmiiEmmai.your.nonsg-father3sg.POSS-Mname'male. name'[Predicate]Argument
'Your father's name is Emmai.' (XIII-65)

]
'... the place [lit. somewhere] where our garden was, was a side(=
tributary) of a big river.' (VI-27)
(2) In a ""possessive"" nominal clause, the Possessee NP stands as the argument, and the
Possessor as the predicate. The Possessor cross-references the gender of the Possessee by a suffix. See further examples in § 11.3.

]
' ... the place [lit. somewhere] where our garden was, was a side C=
tributary) of a big river.' (VI-28, cf. 8-36)
In 3-10, noniko-ng koh tu-ki-no is a relative clause modifying heekoo, which is the
head of the argument noun phrase. Tuu hanna no-ita-kori is a local noun derived from
a classifier construction, functioning as a predicate. cf. §4.6.1 and §8.1.3.2.3.
2) They can be the subjects (Ss) of intransitive verbal or participle clauses. e.g.:
3-11oworeeko-noDEM.L 2nonsg.POSS-Limpakunto-wo-i-no.nowbe.closed-MID.3S-NRPAST-LS Topic
] [Periph. Arg. (Time)]
Intransitive VP
'Your place there has now been closed (=blockaded).' (XV -15)
In 3-11, the headless local NP with a possessive pronoun reeko-no functions as an S
Topic. The head local noun, such as uri 'home', is left unexpressed. cf. § 11.2.3.3.
3) They can be the objects (Os) of transitive verbal or participle clauses. e.g.:
3-12tiiKooausih-a-mo.","[75, 76]"
"Masayuki OnishiAcknowledgementsFirst of all, I would like to express my gratitude to three ladies, without whose
assistance this thesis would never have been completed.
Two of them come from Bougainville. Dora Leslie initiated me into her beautiful
language, taught me and answered my endless questions with utmost patience. Therese
Minitong Kemelfield told lots of interesting stories to me. Her fervent discussions on
Siwai culture were ever so inspiring. For both of them, the last four years must have
been the most dreadful time in their lives --- their mothers and other close relatives were
suffering from the political conflict on the island, and there was no way for them even
to communicate with their own people most of the time. In spite of this frustrating
situation, they never failed to address me with warmth in their hearts. All their family
members living in Australia have become very good friends of my family as well.
Ulrike Mosel, my supervisor in chair, assisted me to write the thesis from beginning
to end with meticulous care. Before starting my PhD, I was virtually a novice in
writing a grammar. I saw the last four years as my apprenticeship, and she was the
most worthy Meisterin. She taught me not only how to write a grammar, but also how
to enjoy writing a grammar. Her liberal and flexible way of thinking very often saved
me from mental exhaustion.
R.M.W. Dixon, my other supervisor, encouraged me to work on this interesting
language, and gave many important suggestions on every chapter of my thesis. I am
greatly indebted to him.
Two other Motuna speakers living in Australia --- Agnes Kennedy and Alex Dawuia
--- provided some language data and were very helpful during my field work. I am
grateful to both of them.
I owe a great deal to other researchers in the languages and cultures of Bougainville
people, especially to Douglas Oliver who worked on the Siwai culture, and to Conrad
and Phyllis Hurd who worked on the Nasioi language. Conrad Hurd kindly provided
me with some valuable data in Nasioi, and helped me getting unpublished materials
from the Summer Institute of Linguistics.
I am also grateful to the Australian National University and the Department of
Employment, Education and Training for the financial assistance provided through anANU PhD Scholarship and an Overseas Postgraduate Research Scholarship, respectively.
This thesis actually started when I took the ""Field Methods"" course conducted by
R.M.W. Dixon in the second semester of 1990. Dora was the informant in this course,
and there were nine other students--- Anna Scott, Hugh Sainty, Jason McDonald, John
Schooneveldt, Karen Gillespie, Peggy Daroesman, Ruth Chisholm, Tim Curnow, and
Xiaonong Zhu. I benefited enormously from their discussion on this language.
My other teachers and fellow students made helpful comments and suggestions on
different parts of my thesis at different times. Detailed comments were made by Phil
Rose, Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Tom Dutton on some of the chapters. Phil Rose,
in addition, gave me various technical advice on the phonetic analysis of my data during
the busiest time of his teaching. Tom Dutton, my advisor, also assisted me in some
technical matters. I am grateful to all of them.
I am a late comer in the arena of linguistics. Although I had long been interested in
·languages, I had never studied linguistics seriously until I came to Canberra in 1989.
In that year I was taught an introduction to linguistics and sociolinguistics by Elisabeth
Patz in the University of Canberra, as a TESOL student. Her excellent lectures determined the direction of my study. In the following year I was enrolled in the ANU, and
since then, I have had ample opportunities to investigate different areas of linguistics
with the assistance of teachers, fellow students and visitors. Among them were Anna
Wierzbicka, Phil Rose and Harold Koch, and my supervisors mentioned above. My
debt is to all the people I encountered in the course of my linguistic studies. This thesis
is in a way a summary of what I have learned from them in the last few years in
Canberra.
My final word of thanks is due to Ayuko, Takashi and our newly-born little Motona.
They created a joyful family environment which I regard as the most valuable thing in
my life. I could get myself refreshed whenever I spent time with them. Our second
son's name was taken from the language name ""Motuna"" with slight modification
according to Japanese phonology. His name will always remind me and my family of
the years we spent in Canberra, and of our special friendship with Motuna speakers.iiAbstractThis thesis is a descriptive grammar of Motuna, a Non-Austronesian language
spoken by several thousand people in the south-western part of Bougainville (called
Siwai), Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Buin Family of the Eastern Bougainville
stock, in the Bougainville Phylum. This grammar is based on the analysis of narrative
texts provided by four speakers of the standard Motuna.
Motuna is a both head and dependent marking agglutinative language with complex
morphology. Like most Non-Austronesian languages in Papua NewGuinea, it is verb
final, and has medial and non-medial verbal categories. In addition, verbs have basic
voice distinction between active and middle voices, and have extensive tense/aspect/mood categories. Nouns have six genders and are also classified by fifty-one
classifiers.
Chapter 1 discusses the typological characteristics, as well as the genetic relations
and dialectal variations of Motuna. It also briefly summarises previous work done on
this language, and provides the scope and data base of this thesis.
Chapter 2 deals with phonetics, phonology and orthography. It includes an introduction to morphophonemics which will be discussed fully in later chapters, particularly in
Chapter 4 (nouns), Chapter 8 (classifiers, numerals and the 'all' quantifier), and
Chapter 13 (verbal morphology).
Chapter 3 outlines the word-classes and the clausal syntax of this language. Chapters 4 - 9 deal with the mopho-syntax of all the word classes except for verbs, participles and verbal nouns. Chapter 10 discusses the internal structure of the NP, and
Chapter 11 possessive, kinship and other constructions.
Chapter 12 outlines the morpho-syntax of verbs. I give a gist of verbal morphology
in this chapter, so that readers may skip Chapter 13 which is a lengthy discussion of
complicated verbal morphology. Chapter 14 discusses valency of verbs including
valency-changing derivations (stimulative, causative, applicative and reciprocal).
Chapter 15 deals with tense/aspect/mood. Chapter 16 deals with two word classes
derived from verbs .,.-- verbal nouns and participles.
Chapter 17 discusses the interclausal relations in Motuna, mainly chaining of medial
verbs and relative clauses.
Finally, three narative texts of this language are provided in Appendix.iiiContents

Rule 2-11-Labialisation of /k/k -> [+labial] I uExamples:kiuruko [kt(i)f(j)k w 0ortuko [t(Ukw o]'two (humans)'
'ants' nest'The phoneme /k/ may be realised as [!J] and UJ in certain morphophonemic environments. cf. Chs 4, 5 and 6.
The archiphoneme /Q/, realised as a glottal stop[?], occurs word-medially before a
consonant, or word-finally, but never in word initial position. I will use the symbol '
for this phoneme in orthographic representation. e.g. /tuQkil tu'ki 'all', /moniQmo/moni'mo 'woman', /kinaaQ/ kinaa' 'yesterday', limoQ/ imo' 'my relatives'.
A glottal stop can also be non-phonemic when it occurs as an intervening consonant
between two vowels across a phonological word boundary""="", or across a grammatical word boundary ""#"" if the grammatical words on both sides constitute a syntactically
tight unit. 8 See examples below. A non-phonemic glottal stop can also occur
between two vowels across a grammatical word boundary in rapid speech, or after a
vowel-final word when the speaker makes a deliberate pause (for hesitation, looking
for a next word, etc.).

§2.2.5. I will use [r] in the examples below where this distinction is irrelevant.","[40, 41]"
"Preview of Verbs2 55CHAPTER 12 PREVIEW OF VERBS12.1INTRODUCTIONVerbs in Motuna distinguish the following grammatical categories:
(1) Active and middle voice. They are distinguished by different sets of S/A/0 crossreferencing bound morphemes. Motuna also has a periphrastic passive construe;...
tion (cf. § 16.3.4).
(2) Medial and non-medial verbs. I call the verbs which mark switch-reference ""medial
verbs"", while those which don't ""non-medial verbs"".' Switch-reference markings indicate whether the ""themes"" 2 of the medial verbal clauses are the same as,
or are different from, those of the following clauses. 3 Fully inflected non-medial
verbs, on the other hand, cross-reference the genders of the sentential topics.
(3) Fourteen TAM categories for non-medial verbs, and three for the same subject
forms and two for the different subject forms of medial verbs.
(4) Verb stems may be underived or derived. Derived stems may take one or more of
the four valency changing suffixes --- stimulative, applicative, causative and
reciprocal.
As mentioned in §3.2.1, verbs consist of the following morphological elements.
1) verb stems,
2) bound morphemes which cross-reference the person and number of core
argument(s),
3) tense/aspect/mood (hence TAM) suffixes, andNote that ""medial verbs"" do not necessarily occupy the medial positions of sentences; they may
even stand as the heads of separate sentences, cf. § 17.1. Some ""non-medial verbs"", on the other hand,
may function as the heads of dependent embedded clauses, and in such cases they may occupy sentencemedial positions.
12Themes often coincide with the grammatical subjects (S or A) of the verbs, but not always, cf.","[283, 284]"

English. In the majority of cases it is difficult to tell which of these languages they are
derived from.
Most of the stems of this type have been found in the corpus of daily conversation of
my two main informants, and in the life stories of the two informants who have less

Table 4-3Underlying Forms of Number SuffixesSingular-0Dual-karoPaucal-naaPlural-ngungNote that the attachment of a number suffix to a noun is optional. It is not used
when the number of the object in question is obvious from the context. Inanimate
nouns c;lo not usually inflect for dual and paucal. 7
Examples:
4-14kupuri 'a stone/stones'
kupuri-ngung '(many) stones'I could find no examples of inanimate nouns marked by the dual or the paucal suffix in my corpus.
According to my informants, however, they can be marked by either of these if the duality or paucality
of the object referred to by the noun is focused on.

nommai-karol-ngaro 'two persons'
nommai-naa 'a few/several persons'
nommai-ngung '(many) people'The initial /k/ of the dual suffix /-karol is often realised as ng. A similar phenomenon
is observed as regards all the case suffixes which begin with /k/ (the ergative /-kif, the
purposive /-ko/, the ablative /-kitee/ and the locative /-koril). The morphophonemic
processes which apply to all these suffixes are informally summarised as follows.''
Rule 4-1Realisation of /kl in the Dual Suffix /-karol and Other SuffixesWhen /k/ is preceded by the archinasal IN/, it is obligatorily realised as ng.
It is realised either k or ng when it is preceded by a sequence of a nasal or avelar stop and a vowel, or by a high or back vowel. The more phonemes of
this type exist in adjacent syllables, the more it is likely to be realised as
ng.sExamples:

Apart from the two obligatory grammatical categories discussed above, the semantic
categories of the referents of nouns may optionally be indicated by classifiers. The
categories expressed by classifiers include 'human', 'animate', 'long object', 'concave
object', 'taro', 'stone', 'human habitation', 'day', etc.
Classifiers are always combined with various bound morphemes, or nouns or verbal
clauses. Classifier constructions thus formed may be juxtaposed to head nouns, may
be employed in headless noun phrases, or may function as NP heads by themselves. I
have attested fifty-one classifiers in my corpus and from elicitation.
Some nouns can take two or more different classifiers in different contexts. For
example, the human noun nommai 'person/people', which is either masculine or
feminine, can take the 'human' classifier -uru, the 'animate' classifier -wori 'animate',
the 'lot' classifier -ngu and the 'group of people' classifier -po injuxtaposition: 10The speaker could also use the paucal form po-owoi-naa (cf. 4-102c in §4.4.4.1.3) to address him,
and verbal forms with a paucal subject such as taapu-r-ong-hee, pi-'-hee.","[101, 102, 103]"

fixes, (2) five non-medial TAM suffixes which are not followed by them, and (3) five
medial 1 TAM suffixes. All the TAM suffixes are listed in Tables 12-3a- c in this
order.
TAM suffixes may express different meanings when they are combined with different types of verbs. For example, the Perfect suffix, when combined with stative verbs
such as tu(h)- 'to be' or tuh-ee- 'to have', indicates a present state ('is/are' or 'have'),
while when combined with action verbs such as pi(h)- 'to go' or terminative verbs such
as patak- 'to arrive', it expresses an event which took place or terminated yesterday or
before and has some relevance to the present situation ('went, have/has gone' or
'(have/has) arrived'). Thus the names of TAM suffixes should be regarded only as
labels.
As mentioned in Ch 13, all the TAM suffixes/categories are indicated by capital
letters. For example, ""definite future TAM"" will be written simply as ""Definite Future"".
This chapter is organised in the following way:
(1) In §15.2, verbs are classified with regards to their inherent aspectual meaningswhich manifest themselves in combination with different TAM suffixes. I will
discuss the aspectual meanings of each class of verbs with relevant TAM suffixes.
(2) In §15.3 and §15.4, I will examine the functions of the above-listed TAM suffixes,
in combination with different types of verbs. In §15.3 I will discuss non-medial
TAM suffixes, and in §15.4 medial TAM suffixes.
(3) In §15.5, I will examine serial verb constructions with ""aspectual verbs"".
(4) In § 15. 6, I will discuss the functions of the reduplication of verbs.","[462, 463, 464]"

usually without determiner. 7 See 3-3, 3-8 and 3-9, respectively.

and apart from these languages, Dora speaks her father's language Roviana (Austronesian) in the Solomon Islands, and Therese her first husband's language Tinputz
(Austronesian) in Bougainville. They also speak neighbouring Non-Austronesian
languages such as Nagovisi and Buin to some extent.
There are other texts by two elderly speakers, Sirou Korikee (female) and Puuwa
Paurarai (male) from Haarii village, which were recorded by Therese when she was
herself collecting narratives and accounts of Siwai tradition from old people.
In all, my main corpus consists of twenty-three texts, in total duration of 138
minutes. As mentioned in § 1.2, there is very little dialectal variation among these
texts. The texts (I), (VIII) and (XVII) are given in Appendix for illustration. This
grammar is inductively formulated by examining the language data in these texts.
In addition, I use three texts of the Pouko dialect obtained from Agnes Kennedy (in
her thirties) for supplement. The reason why I did not use these texts in the same way
as the main texts mentioned above is that the Pouko dialect is quite distinct from other
dialects (cf. §1.2). The former are also characterised by many more loanwords and
incomplete sentences than the latter.
There are four more recorded
texts.
Two of them are recorded from the telephone
.
.
conversation of Therese with another Motuna speaker. One is a free conversation
between Therese and her three daughters. And the last one is a personal history told by
a male speaker, Alex Dawuia (in his forties), from Mamangota village. All these texts
are characterised by loanwords from English and Tok Pisin, and loose conversational
style with lots of incomplete sentences. Sentences and vocabulary (especially loanwords) found in these texts are occasionally used to illustrate particular aspects of the
grammar.
Four short conversational texts, and a collection of 166 short sentences, written by
Dora Leslie, are also used to illustrate some grammatical points.
All the examples cited from the above-mentioned data are identified at the end of
English translation in brackets. For example, (XI-13) indicates that it is taken from the
thirteenth sentence of the text (XI). If there is no number in brackets, the given
example is from elicitation. All the elicited examples were checked carefully by the two
main informants. Gaps in some areas of grammar --- especially in the paradigms of
nouns, classifiers and verbs --- are checked through elicitation. They were also
checked carefully by my two main informants.
The main aim of this grammar is to present major characteristics of this language for
language typologists and linguists in general. It is not exhaustive, but it covers all the
grammatical aspects found in the narrative texts mentioned above. I give examples
quite generously whenever I discuss important grammatical P?ints. Sometimes theIntroduction7same examples are used in different chapters. Wherever it is relevant, the use of the
same example in different chapters is referred to in the text or in brackets after the data
identification number.
Some aspects of the grammar --- such as the paradigms of numeral classifiers, the
use of the agentless passive construction --- are incomplete. These areas of grammar,
as well as detailed analysis of complex sentences and discourse organisation, investigation for sociolinguistic variation and genetic relationship with neighbouring languages,
are left for further research.","[34, 35, 36]"

Except for muu=rii(h)-, which is the compound of muu 'night' and the SA verb rii(h)'to become' (cf. §12.4.4), there is no way to tell whether they are S0 or SA verbs,
since S0 and SA suffixes are identical in 3rd person singular. Usually they take no
overt subject NP, but they may take a dummy subject hoo (or its emphatic form ho-ko),
or a word which refers to the circumstances such as kiakia ""morning', ong koto 'up

In 14-6, since the medial verb with an aspectual verb arut-aro-ma tu-ku is marked by
the different subject suffix, and its subject is Maawa, the subject of the main verbmaapuk-u-u-ng should most naturally be interpreted as haa aru=aru 'the cane basket',
and not Maawa.
Verbs in middle voice are regarded as intransitive, because they cross-reference only
one argument NP even if they take two argument NPs. The noun phrase which is
cross-referenced by such a verb functions as an S argument, and it is not usually
marked by ergative case.
There is, however, at least one exception. The three-place transitive verb hahk- 'to

"2I regard them as subordinating conjunctions because the syntactic behaviour of medial clauses
introduced by them diffe~from that of other medial clauses. The former always occupy the initial
positions of sentences, and cannot stand as separate sentences on their own. (In this respect their
behaviour is similar to that of protases in Imaginative. cf. 17-3.) The latter, on the other hand, can be
placed after or within the controlling clauses, and can stand as separate sentences on their own. See the
discussion below and in § 17 .2.
This sentence has no controlling clause. The continuous SS form noh-u-i expresses a durative
event going on at the reference point of time understood from the context. See the discussion of
examples 17-15-17-17 below.

In most cases, however, medial verbal clauses function as dependent non-embedded
clauses. Switch-reference markings track the ""theme"" of the discourse (cf. Roberts
1988b).
In Motuna, ""theme"" and ""topic"" are two distinct categories. As exemplified inCh 3,
""topic"" is a focal NP argument (usually in absolutive case) in a clause. In a verbal
clause it could be A, 0, S, or a local argument, and is cross-referenced by the gender
suffix on the non-medial verb. It does not control switch-reference operation.

say .to-30.3pcl.A-RMPAST-F'And after they had arrived at the underneath of the mango tree, they said
to her: "" ... ""' (VIII-11)
In 17-11, the topic of the clause with the non-medial verb nah-a-a-na is the 0 argument
'her', which is cross-referenced by the feminine ending -na on the same verb. The
topic of the preceding medial verb patak-a-ro may be the S argument 'they' or the local
argument tii kongsi'-ko poo' 'at the underneath of the mango tree', neither of which is
coreferential with the topic of this controlling clause. If the topic were to control the
switch-reference operation, we would expect that this medial verb would be marked by
the DS suffix -ku. But in fact it is marked by the SS suffix -ro.
As is shown in the above example, switch-reference is usually sensitive to the
coreference of SfA arguments, as in other Papuan languages, and not to the coreference
of clausal topics as defined above. However, there are also many instances where
medial verbs are in the same subject forms even though S/A are not coreferential. e.g.:
17-12tikohooandART.M DEM.DPoiP.o-no-ori''female.name' DEM-LINK-sister.pclturu-woo-roimpanii-komannireturn-MID.3S-PERF.SSand. then1-EMPHcertainlypee-mo

be.transferred-MID.lS.RMPAST-F'And P. and her sisters' father returned, and then, I was certainly trans
ferred.' (XVI-40, cf.11-14)Interclausal Relations507Here the referent of the S of turu-woo-ro (the narrator's husband) and that of the
controlling verb tini-mon-na (the narrator herself) are different. They are regarded,
however, as parts of the same referential framework which includes all the members of
the narrator's family living and moving together.
It is clear from the above example that switch-reference does not operate within the
boundaries of a sentence, but is a thematic operation which essentially identifies the
frame of that particular discourse with that of the adjacent discourse. It is true that S/A
are the major components of such framework in that if they are the same or their
referents overlap, medial verbs are always in the same subject forms. But the spe3ker
can also regard different participants referred to by S/A arguments as belonging to the
same group for discourse reasons, as in 17-12.
Medial verbal clauses often stand as separate sentences. 4 In some cases, the
controlling clause of such a medial clause exists in, or is easily recovered from, the
preceding or following sentence. For example,
17-13ongimono-ji-rii-juu.niimi-ko-ng.","[534, 535, 536]"
"A morpheme boundary does not necessarily coincide with a syllable boundary.
Phonemic and morphophonemic processes across the first two types of boundaries
""#""and""="", and those across the boundary""-"", are quite distinct from each other. The
first two types of boundaries retain the shapes of two phonemes on both sides. For
example, if two vowels are in contact across a boundary ""#"" or ""="", a phonemically
nondistinct glottal stop automatically intervenes (cf. Rule 2-2 in §2.2.1). A boundary
of the last type, on the other hand, allows the two morphemes on both sides to assimilate, dissimilate or coalesce. See, for example, the assimilation processes discussed in §2.7.1, which only affect the boundaries of the last type.
The boundaries marked by ""-"" are not always uniform in their phonological behaviour. For example, the morphophonemic processes which affect the boundaries across
various bound roots and classifiers (Ch 8) are quite different from those which affect
those across verb roots and suffixes (Ch 13).
In Motuna, a phonological word boundary is identified according to the stress
assignment discussed in §2.5. It is also the case that a pause can be freely made across
such a boundary.
Motuna has many types of compounds and syntactic constructions, which consist of
two or more phonological words.
I regard lexicalised units which consist of two or more phonological words as
compounds. Compounds always behave as morpho-syntactic units; other words can
never intervene between phonological words in a compound.",[57]
"Syntactically, noun phrases function as:
1) arguments in verbal and participle clauses,2) arguments in adjectival clauses,
3) arguments and predicates in nominal clauses, or
4) the possessive attributes of other noun phrases.
The arguments of verbal and participle clauses are further categorised as core
arguments, Complements and peripheral arguments. Core arguments and Complements are syntactically obligatory. Peripheral arguments, on the other hand, are
syntactically optional.
Core arguments of verbal and participle clauses are either in absolutive or ergative
case. In the case of verbal clauses, they are obligatorily cross-referenced by the
pronominal markings on the verb.
Verbs, on the other hand, consist of:
1) verb stems,
2) bound morphemes which cross-reference the person and number of core arguments,
and
3) tense/aspect/mood (hence TAM) suffixes.
They are further followed by or fused with a suffix which indicates the gender of the
sentential topic in the case of a fully inflected non-medial verb, or are fused with a
switch-reference suffix in the case of a medial verb.
Cross-referencing markings indicate the person and number of one (in the case of
intransitive verbs) or two (in the case of transitive verbs) core arguments. According to
Dixon's (1979, 1994) suggestions, the following symbols will be used as the abbreviations of core arguments hereafter:Syntactic Preview43the subject of an intransitive verbsthe subject of a transitive verbAthe object of a transitive verb0Complements of verbs, on the other hand, are indicated by the symbol ""C"".
Verbal markings which cross-reference the person/number of S, A and 0 NPs, are
also labelled asS, A and 0 markings respectively.
In most cases sentential topics are one of the core arguments, but not always.
Peripheral NPs in absolutive or ergative case, with local nouns as their heads, can 'also
be topics.

suffix; it can function either as the head of an independent clause, or of an dependent
embedded clause. 3
In 3-2a, the intransitive verb stempi(h)- 'to go' 4 cross-references the 1st person
and the dual number of the S argument by the portmanteau morpheme m, and the suffix
-ti, respectively. They are follwed by the Future TAM suffix -heenutee, the ending ofwhich shows the dual-paucal (DP) gender of the sentential topic, S in this case.
Dual-paucal is not a number category, but a distinct gender category. cf. §4.2.1.
In 3-2b, the transitive verb stem mono- 'to see' cross-references the 1st person of the
0 argument by the suffix -m, and the 3rd person paucal/plural number of the A by the
suffix -a. Then follow the Habitual Past TAM suffix -ki and the feminine gender suffix
3 cf. § 17.1 for the definitions of independent, dependent embedded and dependent non-embedded
clauses.

(XII-18)Verbal Morphology283CHAPTER 13 VERBAL MORPHOLOGY13.1INTRODUCTIONAs mentioned in § 12.2.2, verbs are classified as follows according to the types ,of
cross-referencing markings they take.
(1) In active voice:
(i) transitive verbs, which take 0 and A person/number suffixes.(ii) S0 intransitive verbs, which take 0 person/number suffixes and the 3rd person
dummy A suffix.
(iii) SA intransitive verbs, which take A person/number suffixes.
(iv) irregular intransitive verbs, which mark the person of S by the consonant
alternation of the stems, and the number of S by suffixes.
(2) In middle voice:
intransitive verbs which take middle voice person/number suffixes.
The paradigms of verbs in Motuna are described according to this classification.
Verbs take TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- c after cross-referencing morphemes. In addition, the negative infix /-woo-/ can be placed between crossreferencing markings and the Imaginative, General DS, Continuous SS or DS medial
suffix. TAM suffixes may be followed by gender suffixes in the case of fully inflected
non-medial verbs, or may be fused with a switch-reference marking in the case of
medial verbs. Schematically,
Diagram 13-1Basic Structure of Verbsgender

Any adjacent morphemes may undergo rather complex morphophonemic changes.
All the TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- care given in Table 13-2 in a different
order. They will be indicated by capital letters hereafter. For example, ""definite future
TAM"" will be simply represented by ""Definite Future"" or ""DEFFUT"".","[309, 310, 311, 312]"
"9When an NP is determined by the demonstrative or the article, the classifier usually chooses the
bound form of the same determiner, as in 4-20. In such cases, the demonstrative functions either
deictically or anaphorically, and the article anaphorically. cf. Ch 6. However, it can take other
morphemes, e.g. the 'number one' numeral as in 4-21, which give additional information about the
entity referred to by the head noun. cf. Ch 8.

any other morpheme within or outside the NP. In the above examples, the inflection of
the determiner marks the gender of the noun nommai (masculine or feminine), and not
the semantic category specified by the classifier.
Similarly, the noun moo 'coconut', which is either masculine or dimi,nv.tive, can
cooccur with five different classifiers: -ri 'nut with hard shells', - 'ri 'round object',
-mung 'plant/fruit' , -oita 'half, and mo' 'bunch of nuts'.4-21abcdeongmoono-riDEM.Mcoconutone-CL.nut'this/that one coconut (nut with hard

"1I will call these five TAM suffixes ""medial suffixes"" according to the convention of the grammatical descriptions of other Papuan languages.

TAM and Different Subject categories. Note also that 12-1a and 12-1b take active voice
0/A suffixes, while 12-1c takes a middle voiceS suffix.
Syntactically, verbs may take:
( 1) core noun phrases (S, A or 0 ), which are obligatorily cross-referenced.
(2) Complements (Cs), which are not cross-referenced but are nevertheless syntactically obligatory. Complements can be noun phrases, adjective phrases, adverbials, verbal clauses or quotations.
(3) peripheral arguments, which are syntactically optional.
