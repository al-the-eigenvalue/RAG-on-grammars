30The construction with the Indonesian loan ma-bisa was corrected with the Hatam bit-bon 'follow-make',
expressing 'capability'.
Whereas in (55) ni-ngkeg 'its-skin' is the object of cug, here ni-nnan 'its (shedded) skin' seems to be subject
of this same verb. It could be that cug 'remove' has two valencies, like for example dahat 'break'.
Alternatively, the object is pre-posed in this clause. Although Hatam is a rather strict (S)OV language, it is
possible to have an OV order; cf. (40) and (45) above.",[160]

With the mitibam leaves he tied the spear to the roof. [Kwanding 094]Since the expression of an instrument involves a combination of predicates, the role of an
instrument will be further discussed in §4.5.2.
The general clause formula gives the most common word order. However, other word
orders are possible. Hatam does allow (oblique) objects to be preposed, or time adverbials in
clause-final position. Adverbs are possible at various positions throughout the clause, except
between verb and direct object. These options will be shown when I discuss each clause
constituent in §4.4. But first the general structure of the noun phrase, with comments on its
constituents, will be presented in §4. 1 . Section 4.2 will illustrate non-verbal predications,
which are not covered by the general clause formula. Another construction that does not
correspond to the verbal clause involves impersonal predicates. This will be presented in §4.3.
A rather striking feature of Hatam is its prolific use of asyndetic verb sequences. Since this
phenomenon is pertinent to the issue of serial verb constructions, I will discuss various
combinations of predications and the scope of negation which they allow in some detail in
§4.5. Relative clauses with their possible head nouns are dealt with in §4.6. This chapter will
close with a presentation of clause combinations in §4 .7, according to the conjunctions as
given in §3 . 1 5 .

"2Ger P. Reesink1.2 Hatam and its linguistic neighboursHatam is spoken by approximately 1 6,000 people living in the Arfak mountains, south of
Manokwari in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. According to Griffiths ( 1 994
and pers.comm.), the language comprises five dialects: Tinam, Miriei (or Moille, as in
Craven and De Fretes 1 98 7 ; Moile in Tim PSL Uncen 1 989), Adihup, Uran and Moi? Hans
Iwou (principal of the Primary School at Minyambou) claimed that Tinam and Adihup are
virtually the same, Moille and Uran (y.Iaran) are similar to each other, but clearly distinct
from Tinam, and Moi (also known as Mansim in Indonesian) is quite different. The latter
language variety, also called Moi Brai, was characterised as a mixture of Hatam and Biak,
spoken by a small group of people. Moi Brai turned out to be equivalent to Borai, apparently
a transcription of Brai with an epenthetic vowel. This language is still known by a few people
near the coast. It does seem to be related to Hatam, with some Biak-Numfor features as well.
See Reesink (forthcoming b). In Borai or Moi Brai one refers to the language by mor moi,
while mor pin is 'bahasa Nufor' = the 'Nufor language' and mor brer refers to 'Indonesian'.
In Hatam on the other hand, ni-hyet mor '3SG-voice mor' refers to 'Indonesian'. Apparently
the term mor, which meant 'language' to the Moi Brai, had the connotation 'foreign' to the
other Hatam groups, such as Miriei and Tinam.
The origin of the name Hatam is not clear. Pouwer (1 958:40) suggests that the word has a
Numfor origin: atam 'thatch of pandanus leaves'. Possibly it is an outsider's interpretation of
ni-hyet tinam '3SG-speech tinam' as a native speaker of Tinam would refer to hislher
language. Tinam is the major dialect, in which the New Testament has been published (by
Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia in 1 99 3). It is easily understood and spoken by speakers of the
other dialects. A systematic dialect study has not been done, but it seems that the major
difference between Miriei and Tinam is a regular correspondence between lsi and /hI, as in
M iriei sab and Hatam hab for 'bird', sum and hum 'fire', and so on. It is the Tinam dialect
that is the object of this study. I have no further information on variation between the other
Hatam dialects. Neighbouring language groups are Sougb and Meyah. The Sougb are called
Tuig in Hatam, and the Meyah are called Sreu.
Typologically, Sougb, Meyah and Hatam appear to be very similar to each other and to
other languages of the so-called West Papuan Phylum: SVO word order, verbal morphology
limited to subject prefixation, Noun-Adjective-Determiner in the NP, Genitive-Noun order in
possessive constructions, and the use of prepositions (see also Reesink 1 996). Lexically the
languages have very little in common, although a few items suggest a remote genetic
relationship between Hatam and the East-Bird's Head family, which comprises Sougb and
the closely related languages Meyah and Moskona. See Reesink ( 1 998).
All languages of the (eastern) Bird's Head have at least a few words of Austronesian
origin, presumably from Biak-Numfor, such as pas 'rice', sansun 'clothes' and wonggor
'crocodile' . Hatam has borrowed extensively. How old those loans are is hard to say at the
moment. Items such as pikor 'school', las 'day', pinak 'send' are probably quite recent, but
others, such as mai 'loincloth' (Numfor mar) and hup 'highlands' (Numfor sup) could be
quite old. See Reesink ( 1 99 8). An assessment of the relationship between Hatam and Biak­
Numfor would need more information on what seems to be the 'missing link ', the nearly
extinct language Borai.","[17, 18]"

languages in general with adjacent Austronesian languages.",[97]
"Introduction71 .4 Data collection and presentationThis grammar is based on data collected during two short periods of fieldwork, 1 5
October-30 November 1 994 and 8 November- I I December 1 99 5 , in M inyambou, in the
kecamatan Warmare, Kabupaten Manokwari, Bird's Head, Irian Jaya. These periods were
too short to afford extensive trekking through the area in order to obtain data on dialectal
differences. Instead, I stayed in Minyambou and collected word lists there and in adjacent
Mbenti. From a few speakers I obtained texts from the oral tradition. But I also recorded a
long personal narrative (Yoas Wonggor from Mbenti) and a sermon, given by Habel Iwou in
the church at Minyambou. These narratives in natural speech could be checked and
elaborated on with the excellent help from the principal of the primary school at M inyambou,
Hans Iwou. The dictionaries compiled by Dick Griffiths allowed me fast access to the
vocabulary of Hatam. A first result of this research was published as 'Explorations in Bert's
Head: Hatam' in Baak et al. ( 1 995).
Having done some preliminary analysis on this material I returned to the Hatam area in
the fall of 1 995 to verify and increase my data. A few other texts were recorded, some
myths, a short historical account of events during the Second World War, and two short texts
about 'slave'-trade in the Eastern Bird's Head.
In order to test phonological problems, a number of short sentences with contrasting items
were pronounced by three different speakers, who were prompted in Indonesian. In order to
investigate the status of verb sequences I took sentences from the recorded texts, changed
them into a negative, or a relative construction, manipulated presence or absence of certain
affixation, and asked native speakers what these sentences meant in I ndonesian, or whether
they could be used in a particular situation. The result of this method is that most examples in
this grammar are taken from natural speech, but that the discussion on relative clause and
scope of negation relies more heavily on elicited material. As much as possible, especially
where deemed significant to stress natural language use, I have indicated in brackets from
which recorded text an example is taken. The text references include texts which have not
been included in this volume.
Throughout this volume I attempt to follow, as much as possible, the established
orthography as employed in the published Hatam material, such as the New Testament. The
most obvious discrepancy concerns the spelling of the negative. I n the established
orthography this is bi 'not', but since I believe the word resembles items spelled with final -ig
(for example, often a noticeable friction following the high vowel-see §2.3 for further
details), I have chosen for the spelling big.
In spite of the additional information obtained during my second visit to Minyambou,
many questions remain. In particular, the extent of the phonemic status of geminate
consonants cannot be unequivocally stated. Likewise, the status of various elements described
in the morphology and syntax is rather dubious. This is no surprise, of course, considering
that my analysis is based on fieldwork of only eleven weeks. In a sense, it could be
considered to be rather presumptuous to attempt to write a grammar on the basis of such a
short exposure to a language. While I was in the process of revising an earlier version of this
grammar, an even more presumptuous account of the language was published.
Based on a short trip, Donohue ( 1 997) published a Hatam phonology and grammatical
notes. He does not recognise high vowels in the language, nor any contrast between single and
geminate consonants. He also posits a series of labio-velar consonants, for which there is no
evidence. His ykpe 'house' refers to a compound ig-bei 'house-under'. There are quite a few
data in his paper which show the typical misunderstandings a first survey invariably contains.
For example, he identifies the nasal in nggwen 'sick' and kney 'bad' as the same element,8Ger P. Reesinksignalling a strong denial. In fact, there are no other items that relate in the same way as kei
'good' and kanei 'bad' , which suggests that the formal similarity is just accidental. The word
for 'sick', nggwen, is one of many that begin with a homorganic nasal, but gwen does not
exist, as far as I know. So far, a semantic constant between lexical items that differ only in
the presence or absence of an initial homorganic nasal could not be established. To be fair, it
may be that his data are from a different dialect, spoken near the Anggi lakes, which may
have a Beneficiary marker yp, or a coreferential subject marking prefix ho. In the Tinam
dialect, I have not found anything that suggests a particular morphology to indicate
something like a switch-reference mechanism. This is not the place to make an evaluation of
every item in Donohue's paper. The value of a description depends to a degree on the time
one has been exposed to a language. In other words, the present work too may contain a
number of misunderstandings and wrong analyses, which may show up after a more thorough
acquaintance with the language.
This monograph does not pretend to give more than a preliminary description of Hatam
and I have refrained from extensive discussions of a theoretical nature. This applies in
particular to the phonology, which at first glance appeared to be quite simple, but does
contain a number of problematic issues related to the stress pattern. In the area of syntax , a
theoretical discussion regarding serial verb constructions is avoided. I have simply tried to
arrange my data in such a way that some arguments bearing on that topic can find some
corroboration. Following the chapters on phonology and grammar, I present a few texts, with
annotations.","[22, 23, 24]"
"Texts1 33In order to make opaque syntactic structures more transparent I have indicated significant
pauses by a slash. This correlates for almost 1 00% with a rising intonation, signalling that
there is more to come. A falling contour on the final syllable indicates that a sentence has
come to its end. This is indicated with #. In the free translations I have tried to correlate
slashes with commas and # with full stops. Thus natural speech, which is hardly ever
delivered in the neat syntactic structures native speakers offer out of context, is maintained.
This allows the reader to understand apparent diversions from claims made in the grammar
regarding word order or presence/absence of certain morphological markers. At the same
time, at a number of places the recorded material is not clear enough to chose between
certain possible alternatives. This has been indicated in footnotes throughout the texts.
Indonesian loans, which occur sparingly in the four myths but are rather frequent in the text
about Kain Timur, are indicated in bold print.","[148, 149]"

Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) priority programme 'The Irian Jaya Studies: a
Programme for Interdisciplinary Research' (ISIR), financed by the Netherlands Foundation
for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). The programme is carried out in
cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, The Indonesian Institute of
Sciences).
I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan
Bahasa (National Centre for Language Development), for his willingness to be the sponsor of
the linguistic studies carried out under the auspices of ISIR.
In order to study the Hatam language in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya I also needed
and readily obtained permission from the authorities in Jayapura, Irian Jaya, and more
specifically in the regency (Kabupaten) Manokwari. I thank the heads of Sospol (Direktorat
Jenderal Sosial Politik) and Bappeda (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah) for
their permission.
But with just the permission and support of the governmental authorities it is hard to study
a regional language such as Hatam. During my first visit to Manokwari, Rogier Gruys gave
me many useful suggestions about whom I should contact. So, before I even travelled to
Hatam territory, I visited the office of World Wide Fund for Nature, where various Hatam
speakers were employed. The director, Daud Womsiwor, arranged for me to meet with
Yohanes Wonggor and Marinus Mandacan, both from Mokwam. They taught me a few
useful expressions in Hatam, and supplied me with a letter in Hatam about regulations for the
nature reserve. Yohanes read it on tape and gave me the meaning in Indonesian.
In Minyambou I was welcomed by the missionaries of The Evangelical Alliance Mission,
Dick and Char Griffiths and Walter and Dianne Kennedy. My thanks are due to them for
their hospitality and their help. The TEAM director in Manokwari, Elmer Lorenz, graciously
allowed me to use the organization's address and infrastructure to keep in contact with people
in my home country.
There is no way to learn a language without native speakers willing to teach. Many Hatam
people have been very friendly and helpful. They were willing to tell stories, which I recorded
and transcribed, or just provided words or sentences which I needed in order to make progress
with my analysis. Thanks are due to: andigpoi Tuantiei Dowansiba, and Yoas Wonggor,
Yoas Iwou, Yairus Dowansiba, Erens Morum, Isak Mandacan, Esap Iwou. In particular, the
texts from Tuantiei were not always easy to understand. Hans Iwou, principal of the primary
school in Minyambou, was a patient and astute teacher. He not only helped me understandxiiAcknowledgementsthese difficult texts, but also was able to answer my many questions regarding morphological
and syntactic complexities. When he was not at Minyambou during my second visit in 1 995,
I found his cousins Yakonias Iwou and Yoas Iwou willing to help me with my questions. But
Hans Iwou, living then at Maruni, could again answer some remaining questions, when I
returned from Minyambou to Manokwari in December 1 995.
Finally, I want to express my thanks to two anonymous referees and Bert Voorhoeve for
commenting on a first draft. In particular, Bert had gone through the manuscript with a fine­
tooth comb, and made many valuable suggestions. I want to thank Jelle Miedema, Dianne
van Oosterhout and Leontine Visser for comments on an earlier version of the
anthropological notes in the Introduction. I have benefited from comments by Harry van der
Hulst and Ian Maddieson on the phonology chapter. Cecilia Ode has helped me with the
measurements and printing the spectograms. None of these people are, of course, responsible
for the flaws that remain.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"98Ger P. ReesinkSuch sequences are all necessarily same-subject, in contrast with similar sequences
interrupted by ba 'and' or lene 'then' (see §4.7. 1 ), which may have either same or different
subjects. When explicit conjunctions are employed it is clear that the sequence involves
coordination of clauses. The same observation holds for sequences interrupted by a pause, as
in example (4.97). But the question is, what is the status of sequences without connectives?
Are they asyndetically coordinated clauses? Does Hatam require an analysis positing a
special class of serial verb constructions? What happens to verbal prefixation in close verbal
sequences? What syntactic restrictions are placed on various sequences? In this preliminary
descriptive work I refrain from theoretical commitments with regard to the issue of serial
verb constructions. I have tried to gather data that seems to be relevant to the matter, and will
present that without too much interpretation.
In order to at least partly answer these questions I will discuss morphological and syntactic
features of the following categories: (i) Directional verb sequences, (ii) Instrumental verb
sequences, (iii) Purposive verb sequences, (iv) Perception verbs + complements, and (v)
General juxtaposition. These sections are then followed by a discussion of the scope of
negation.
4.5. 1 Directional verb sequencesDirectional verb sequences may be divided into:
(i)V l = Directional (± Adverbial) + V2(ii)V l = Action (± Object) + V2= Directional(i)When V I is a directional verb, such as ug 'go (away from deictic centre)' or kwei
'come (to deictic centre)"" and it is immediately followed by V 2 , then subject
prefixation is obligatorily absent on the second verb, as in:
(4.98)Api ni-kwei
kwen tut
sop-nya -o
munggwom-nya-o.
then l EXC-come cook with woman-PL-or child-PL-or
Then we'd come and cook (the meat) with the women and children.
*Api ni-kwei ni-kwen tut sop-nya-o.","[113, 114]"
"Syntax1 13The difference between die-no) and po is not clear. In natural texts the former is far more
frequent. Also, I have not seen instances of subject relativisation with po. The marker po may
be a more general reference to something which has been mentioned before, whereas die-no)
seems to be more deictic-specific. That example (4. 1 57) was translated with Indonesian itu
'that' and (4. 1 5 8) without this determiner may be significant.

=4 Syntax
4.0 IntroductionHatam is a rather strict SVO language, with time adverbials normally preceding the
subject. A subject NP (where NP includes pronouns) is often not required, since the verbal
predicate is obligatorily marked for person/number of the subject. Oblique objects, such as
locative or directional adverbials, benefactive or purposive constituents, are expressed as
preposition phrases, following the direct object. However, in natural speech I have not found
instances of all the constituents within one clause. Thus, a general formula for the clause in
Hatam is:

1 EXC-shoot bird
two know not
We were not at all able t o shoot two birds. (lit. enough/adequate we shoot two
birds know not)It seems significant that the impersonal predicate has a purpose clause, introduced by mem
as its complement, as in (4.45). A similar construction has a nominalised adjective as its
head:
(4.46 )Gi-kei

NOM-good foratimai-o

and.so.on don't
It would be good (better) if no butterflies or cuscus and such like are caught.
(from World Wildlife Fund instructions on the conservation area)Although the status of these constructions is not very clear, they are different enough from
sentences with a modal adverb in initial position, in that the latter do not have a complement
clause with mem 'for' (see further §4.4. 5).
4.4 Clause constituents
4. 4. 1 Temporal adverbialsTemporal adverbials have a preference for clause-initial position:
(4.47)Njap di
ammani
nyeni i-miap ...
light REL today
we
l INC-hear
Today (this morning) we hear. . . [Habel 1 :00 1 ]They are often followed by connectives ba 'and', lene 'and; then' or api 'then; following'
and thus, strictly speaking, placed outside the clause:
(4.48)Api
njap gom lene dani di-bit
di-pmang
ba
then day
one
then I
I SG-follow I SG-fa.in.law and . . .
Then one day I went with my father-in-law and (we went hunting with our
dogs). [Hans:002]Occasionally, one finds temporal adverbials in clause-final position, as in:

kep

INS-countnjap njap cem
light light also
then for him to shoot birds every day also [Wonggor 2:40]
4. 4.2 SubjectThe subject always precedes the predicate. Since verbal predicates are always marked for
person-number of the subject, subject NPs are by no means obligatory. Recall that third
person singular has a zero prefix (which I do not always indicate). When explicit subjects do
occur, they are in the form of an NP, sometimes extended with an appositional NP, as in88Ger P. Reesinkexample (4.50), or a full pronoun (4. 5 1 ). A short pronoun form, i.e. without ni, does not
often occur in subject position.

4.4.3 ObjectAs stated in §3 .4.2, transitive verbs require an object if it is not recoverable from the
context. This statement is based upon the informant's judgement that a sentence like 'At that
time we hadn't eaten yet' would require an explicit object in Hatam: ni-yem njinta big-yo
'we-eat food not-yet'. At the moment I cannot formulate a rule which specifies when an
object has to be provided or when it can be left out. In natural discourse, once an item has
been introduced, it does not happen too often that the referent cannot be recovered, so
transitive predicates without an explicit object are quite frequent. Thus, once the known
referent is referred to by an explicit NP binggas dima in example (4.5 2), in the subsequent
clauses the object is zero:
(4.52)Api

full forms seem to indicate some emphasis:

"For alternative conjunction, the Indonesian loan word (a)tau 'or' is used.
Clausal conjunctions can be distinguished as sequencing, contrastive and adverbial. Some
are simple, most are complex conjunctions. Their meaning along with their syntactic
behaviour is discussed in §4.7. Here, I will give a list with a brief characterisation.
(i)Sequencing conjunctions are:
ba 'and', which can be phonetically weakened to [bg]. It is then homophonous to the
weakened variant of bak 'to'. Thus, the purposive clitic bi (see §3 .2.6) may well be
related to ba, rather than to bak. The matter is more complicated. Just as the third
person pronouns no and yo have allomorphs with a final fKI, nok and yok, likewise bak
and ba may be alternative realisations, with divergent functions: the former as
preposition, the second as conjunction.
lene '(and) then', which is definitely derived from the preposition leu 'from' and the
topic marker ne, since some speakers still alternate between the two phonetic
realisations.
api 'and then, consequently', which conveys a somewhat stronger sense of sequence
than lene. It is found with third person singular pronoun, apino 'then' or preceded by
the preposition leu 'from' (as in leu api 'after that') or preceded by ug e 'go Q',
expressing that the first conjunct i s finished, as in Anggos (8) and Dowansiba (29) in
the Appendix.(ii)Contrastive conjunctions are:
10 'but, and';
noro 'but', probably a compound of no '3SG' and 10.(iii)Adverbial conjunctions make use of a preposition or a nominaliser:
leu 'from' signals a reason or causal relationship, sometimes in combination with 0
'inclusive disjunction ': leuo;
leubinhyepo 'in order that' is probably made up of leu 'from' + bi 'INS' + ni-hyet '3SG­
word' + po 'Anaphoric relativiser' . It is often shortened to lenhyepo, or nhyepo;
mem gima is also found with the meaning 'in order that'. It is transparently 'for NOM­
that' ;
gi, the nominalising clitic (see §3.2.4) by itself or compounded with n o '3SG' = gino
means 'if' or 'when'. That is, it signals a conditional protasis or temporal contingency.(iv)Some other complex conjunctions convey a meaning like 'therefore', 'so then'. They
are:
gi-ma-ri-ne or gi-ma-ri-no 'NOM-that-GIV-TOP/3SG'; and
nok lene '3SG and then', which is phonetically realised as [nogrene].",[92]
"3.2 CliticsHatam has a number of clitics. These are monosyllabic morphemes, which are
phonologically attached to a number of different word classes. They are mainly unstressed,
but as the discussion of metrical stress indicated, Hatam may shift stress quite easily away
from content words. Although some clitics can indeed never receive stress, some others can
form a iambic peak.
There are five enclitics. Two occur on clause level: they are interrogative markers -i and
-e, which will be discussed in the section on question words. Two occur mainly on nominal
constituents. The citation marker -a and the inclusive disjunction marker -0 are directly
attached to nouns or the nominal modifiers that may follow in an NP. A third enclitic is the
nominalising device tilsi, which can be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions.
The alternation of its initial consonant is determined by the coda of the preceding syllable. Of
these enclitics, only -0 may receive stress.
Then there are three proclitics in Hatam: gi- and di- occur with verbs, adjectives and
demonstratives. Neither of these is ever stressed. A third proclitic is a weakened form of the
preposition bak 'for', namely bi- [b�], which has both prepositional and conjunctive functions.
There are instances of stress even on the clitic variant. The three enclitics on nominal
constituents will be discussed first, followed by the three proclitics.
3.2. 1 Citation marker -aWhen nouns are given in isolation they are always given with an unstressed enclitic -a,
which is therefore glossed 'citation marker' (CIT):
(3. 1 5)nab-a
pig-CIT['na.ba]minyei-a
water-CIT[rnI . 'fiey.ya]In running text, many nouns are pronounced with a final [a] or [�], which may be a
weakened variant of [a], even though they do not figure in a list. Nouns with this clitic occur
either at the end of a clause as in example (3 . 1 6), or as preposed object (3 . 1 7), or as subject
of a non-verbal predicate (3 . 1 8). Clause-final -a often is found on imperatives, as in (3 . 1 6).

"Although in examples (3 . 1 84) and (3 . 1 85) the position of the object relative to the verb
and adjunct cannot be ascertained, there appears to be a major difference between
constructions involving kep and ser with respect to the possible position of the object.
Consider the same adjuncts with the verb ttei 'carry' in (3 . 1 86) and (3 . 1 87).
(3 . 1 86) (a) Di-ttei
kep
1 SG-carry keep.onto

1213biei.
woodIf my semantic identification is correct, it is quite possible that ser may be used as a verb meaning 'to
remove something out of something'. If kep could also be inflected, as possibly in K wanding ( 1 7) in the
Appendix, these two adjuncts may well be of verbal origin in serial verb-like constructions; compare §4.S.
I have only one example of kep following a noun, but this may be an idiomatic expression:
Di-yok di-tingou kep
ni-hyet.
I SO-put I SO-ear
keep.onto 3S0-word
I listen carefully to his words.
See further Anggos (3) and (23) in the Appendix for examples with kep following the object of a transitive
verb.",[90]

"3 Morphology3.0 IntroductionThis chapter gives the word classes that appear necessary for a description of Hatam. This
language, like the languages that are claimed to constitute the West-Papuan Phylum, has a
rather limited morphology. Inalienable nouns and verbs are prefixed to index person-number
of possessor and subject. To facilitate the treatment of nouns and verbs, I will first discuss
the personal pronouns. There are a number of clitics which apply either to lexical items or to
clausal constituents. These will be presented before the other word classes are discussed. The
way some of the clitics operate on different word classes can then be described in the
appropriate sections. This chapter then, will provide all the 'building blocks' which are
needed to account for the syntactic structures to be discussed in Chapter 4. In general I will
use the established orthography. At times, when necessary, phonetic realisations will be
specified.
3.1 PronounsAlthough the pronominal prefixes have already been given in §2.6, they are here repeated,
in Table 3 . 1 , to show their relationship with the free forms and other pronominal forms. Here
I employ the established orthography. Recall that the vowel in the prefixes when following a
consonant is the unspecified vowel, most frequently realised as [;:>]. Most prefixes are clearly
related to the free pronouns.
Table 3.1 : Personal pronounsFreePrefixPossessiveEmphaticExclusiveI SGdadi-dit-de*da-ntida-ngkom2SGnaa-a-dena-ntina-ngkom3SGno(k)0; ni-ni-deno-ntino-ngkoml INCnyei(g)-i-denye-ntinye-ngkomnye-ntinye-ngkomje-ntije-ngkoml EXCnyeni-nyen-de/ni-de *2PLjeji-ji-deMorphologyFreePrefixPossessiveEmphaticExclusive3PLyork)i(g)-i-deyo-ntiyo-ngkom1 DUsasi-si-desa-ntisa-ngkom41* The morphophonology of possessive pronouns leaves some questions: most forms clearlyhave a voiced alveolar stop and stress on the second syllable. Native speakers insist that first
singular is dit-de, realised phonetically as [dgtE], which contrasts with an aspirated alveolar
voiceless stop in dete = [dgthE] 'my side'. Likewise nye-nde is realised as [nyente], without
aspiration. Possibly, some remnant of possessive linker is still present in some forms (see also
kinship terms as inalienable nouns in §3.3 . 1 ).
In most instances the free pronouns are suffixed with -ni: dani, nani, noni, nyeni, jeni,
yoni, and sani. The suffix is identical to the near deictic ni 'this', possibly derived from it and
bleached of its deictic meaning. It is not quite clear which factors determine the distribution
of short and long free pronouns. Subject position seems to prefer the suffixed form, as in
example (3. 1 ), and (oblique) object position seems to favour the short forms, as in (3.2). But
this is certainly not a strict rule, as (3.3) shows.

"In general, the word order in the RC is basically the same as in a main declarative clause.
The main participants obey the order Subject-Predicate-Direct Object-Oblique Object.
Whichever constituent is relativised on is fronted and the RC is introduced by a relativiser.
Temporal adverbials, which in a main declarative clause normally precede the clause nucleus,
are not permitted in their canonical position in a RC. Thus, (4. 1 88b) is unacceptable.

that4.7 Clause combinations
4. 7. 0 IntroductionIn §4 .S , I discussed combinations of predicates. Most of those constructions can be
considered to form complex predicates or clauses. No natural discourse can do without
combining clauses, which generally is effected by conjunctions. Traditionally, the dichotomy
of coordination versus subordination is used, but it is not always clear which criteria are1 20Ger P. Reesinkdistinctive. The morphological material used to express various semantic relations between
clauses indicates that this is not a clear dichotomy in Hatam. This section is built on the
conjunctive material of Hatam itself (see §3 . 1 5), which suggests a division between
i) conjunctions used for sequencing events, ii) contrastive conjunctions and iii) conjunctions
which signal more specific semantic relations, such as cause, purpose, condition. The first
two categories roughly correspond to what traditionally is called coordination, while the third
reminds us of adverbial clauses, which are more subordinated.
,
With regard to the conjunctions ba 'and', lene 'and then', and api 'thereupon 25, one could
claim an increasing scale of sequentiality. Since speakers are not bound by absolute values on
such a scale, there are contexts in which these conjunctions are interchangeable. As an
introductory illustration, consider all three of them in (1 89).

then 1 EXC-roast deer that
and
1 EXC-cut.up
It died and then we roasted the deer and we cut it up. [W onggor 1 :040-04 1 ]
The more neutral ba, which is mainly used for same subject (or topic) sequences (4 . 1 89f),
conveys something like 'in addition (I want to say)' in (4 . 1 8ge) and signals an immediate
sequence of events (see §4.7 . 1 . 1 ).
The most frequent conjunction to start a new sentence is lene (4. 1 89a), which is neutral to
the distinction between same and different subject . Thus, it is not claimed that Hatam
employs a switch-reference system as do many Papuan languages of the Trans-New Guinea
phylum. In combination with other words lene is used to express concepts such as 'after' and
'before'.
Api signals a greater temporal distance between events, as in (4. 1 89d) and (4. 1 8ge). It
may cooccur with either ba or lene.
25These translations are, of course, approximations, just like the Indonesian equivalents which informants
supply: ba in most contexts is rendered as dan 'and' or lalu 'then'; lene is lalu or terus 'continuing'; api is
lalu, terus, or kemudian 'thereafter',Syntax121Tail-Head linkage, the typical narrative strategy to begin a new sentence with a repetition
of final material from a preceding sentence, as example (4. 1 89) shows, uses lene or api as
conjunction, but not ba.
Section 4.7 . 1 will deal with these three conjunctions and possible combinations. In 4.7.2
I will discuss the contrastive conjunctions lo and noro, which in most contexts are felicitously
translated by 'but'. In §4.7.3 the adverbial conjunctions will be presented.
4. 7. 1 Sequencing conjunctions
4. 7. 1. 1 ba 'and'Basically, ba signals a rather neutral addition of actions or events by the same subject, as
in examples (4. 1 90) and (4. 1 9 1 ).

1 EXC-come roast and 1 EXC-eat
Thereupon we came (and/to) roast (the deer) and we ate.[Wonggor 1 :050]When subjects of consecutive clauses refer to subsets, ba can be used. For example, in
example (4. 1 92) the second subject, third person singular, was part of the first subject, first
person plural exclusive, while in (4. 1 9 3) the first person singular of the first subject is a
member of the set referred to by the first person plural exclusive in the following clause.

Then I followed my friends of the headwaters of the Mben also and we got
each other and we hunted birds too. [Wonggor 1 :024]Perhaps it would be better to substitute 'same topic' for 'same subject', since not only are
subsets of referents considered as 'same', but when (oblique) objects of the first predicate1 22Ger P. Reesinkhave the same referent as the subject (or possessor) of the second conjunct, ba is used.
Consider example (4. 1 94), where the direct object of the first predicate has the same referent
as the subject of the second, which is not different from what is described as purposive
sequence in §4. 5 . 3 . In (4 . 1 9 5) the conjuncts are separated by a clear pause, followed by a
new nominal subject, referring to the same participant. In (4. 1 96) the possessor of the second
conjunct has the same referent as the zero anaphoric object of the first one.

sentences following some collateral information, as in (4. 1 97), where the narrator has just

In elicited material as in example (3 . 1 86) kep is allowed only directly following the verb,

the object. The order indicates a difference in the affectedness of the object. For example, in
elicitation (3 . 1 8 8a) was rejected by one informant and immediately rephrased by another as

throwInformants either claim there is no difference, or try to restrict the postnominal

munggwom a-de-nya would be used when the children are no longer present. Such an
explanation is hardly relevant to the difference between (4. 1 4a) and (4. 1 4b). My conclusion
is that the postnominal possessives stand in an appositional relation to the possessed noun.

4.5.2 Instrumental verb sequencesAs mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Hatam does not allow Instruments as
clausal constituents. They are introduced either as object of an initial clause with ba 'use' or
another manipulative verb, or as a single NP connected to the main predicate with ba 'and' or
lene 'then'. The verb in the main predicate is instrumental, i.e. stem + prefix bi-. If the
instrument has been given as object of an initial clause, the main verb does not require a
subject prefix:

Verbs allow a number of morphological processes, which will be presented after syntactic
features with respect to transitivity have been discussed. The basic difference between
transitive and intransitive verbs is that the former can have an object, but not necessarily
occur with one, whereas the latter do not allow an object.
3. 4. 1 Intransitive verbsIntransitive verbs, such as mai 'die', mmai 'be embarrassed', pa 'laugh', pim 'cry' cannot
have a direct object. To indicate the reason or cause for such a state of affairs, a
prepositional object is required, as for example tut in (3.6 1 a); (3.6 1 b) is ungrammatical.

"5758In this one sentence, the narrator tells about the descent of Anggos into a traditional house: bot nai are the
upper rafters, supporting the roof; bot dihyei are the rafters that support the bot nai. Further down one
encounters two racks, the upper one, pak, holds the firewood, the lower one, srou forms the sleeping place
for humans. The word dihyeisi usually refers to the earth in general. Dihyei is 'ground, soil, land' and
appears to be made up of the relative marker di plus the verb hyei 'grow, protrude'. The form do following
gwam is an enigma, it is followed by a pause which suggests a repair in the utterance.
It is very likely that the schwas on ni-ntab reflect the citation clitic -a 'CIT', allowing for the OV order in
some of the clauses in line (23). Notice also that final consonants may easily be dropped, as in nta, but also
in ni-mat 3SG-vagina', which is then compounded with ntab 'hair'. The verb kim has the specific meaning
of 'tying something to something else'.",[176]

Those adverbs that convey a more aspectual meaning, such as kikau 'continually ',
haniyai 'quickly' are more mobile. Although they prefer a clause-final position, as in (4.83a),
they can also be found clause-initially (4.8 3b), or directly preceding the predicate, (4. 83c).

stealIt seems that a clause-final position is more appropriate for manner adverbs. For example,
a number of adjectives (e.g. kei 'good', kinei 'bad', igbit 'true', cun 'short', jei 'long') and the
adverbs derived from pronouns (no-ngkom 's/he/it-alone') may function as adverbials in
order to specify the manner by which an action is done. They always immediately follow the

"1Introduction1.1 BackgroundWhen the multidisciplinary program ISIR was conceived at the end of 1 992, the focus
was on the south-west of the Bird's Head peninsula of Irian Jaya. At the same time, we
realised that a detailed study of languages spoken in the eastern part of the Bird's Head was
necessary if we wanted to obtain a more complete picture of the so-called West-Papuan
phylum and other language groups in this area. One intriguing target was what was known as
a phylum-level isolate in the eastern part of the Bird's Head: Hatam.
Not much was known. We knew that missionaries of TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance
Mission) were working on a bible translation in that language, but no linguistic description
was available. The oldest information on the language was a (very) short article by Loukotka,
which contains a few words of the language. ' Cowan ( 1 953) does not contain any Hatam
material. He presents some data on what he calls Mansibaber, which can be identified as
Meyah or related Moskona, and Manikion (equated with Mantion), which can be identified
as Sougb.
In Voorhoeve (1 975) and Wurm and Hattori ( 1 98 1 ) Hatam and Borai are treated as
related languages, clearly separate from neighbouring language groups. In later publications,
Borai has disappeared and Hatam is listed as an isolate (Voorhoeve ( 1 987a, 1 987b), Silzer
and Heikkinen ( 1 99 1 )). In fact, Voorhoeve ( 1 9 8 7b:9 1 ) substitutes the name Tinam for
Hatam and Silzer and Heikkinen ( 1 9 9 1 : 50) include Borai together with a number of other
names as alternatives for Hatam.
Similarly, not much was known about Manikion or Mantion, Meyah or Moskona. As the
ISIR program started in 1 99 3 we learned that members of the Summer Institute of
Linguistics were active in Meyah (and Moskona), and that Manikion was in fact a derogatory
term for people who call themselves Sougb. In Sougb also, TEAM missionaries were
involved in bible translation, but no linguistic description was available.
Our plan, then, was to try to increase our knowledge of these languages, either through our
own fieldwork or through material from SIL linguists. The main question was: What kind of
language is Hatam? Related questions were: What is the status of Borai? Does it exist as a
separate language? Is it possible to get some more information on Sougb?
The answer to the first question is found in this monograph, with some preliminary
information on the related questions provided in this introduction (see § 1 .2).","[16, 17]"
"With position verbs, kep conveys an aspectual meaning of 'durative, habitual', as in gwam
kep 'sit for a long time', ya kep 'stand for a long time', which seem to imply 'being busy
doing something'. With motion verbs the combination with kep is characterised as 'always' or
'usually': mbut kep 'always walk', sgan kep 'always cross (a river)"" cai kep 'enter keep onto' .

not[noni buy d�I)wage bi]The final IK/ of IngwaK/ 'empty' in example (2.6) is unreleased, preceding a morpheme­
initial stop, and the final /KI of l-ngwaK/ 'forehead' in (2.7) is a voiced velar stop, followed
by a schwa. This schwa could be a transitional element, helping to define a contrast between
final voiced versus voiceless stops, or to shape the preferred rhythmic pattern, but I ratherPhonology17suspect i t t o be a weakened variant o f the citation clitic - a 'CIT' (see §3.2 . 1 ). In other words,
the different realisations are due to the phonetic environment, rather than the inherent
phonological shape.
As far as I know, there are no possible minimal pairs within the word class nouns. Similar
phonetic realisation of nouns such as bed-a 'moon-CIT' or ngwag-a 'forehead-CIT' and
words of other categories, such as the verb bet 'to wait' or adjective ngwak 'empty' never
cause misunderstanding. Only within the class of verbs have I found minimal pairs suggesting
a contrast between voiced and voiceless velar stops in final position, but these are restricted
to verbs with the vowel lui, as in huk 'to chase, hunt' versus hug 'to pour', cuk 'to order'
,
versus cug 'to threaten .6
There does seem to be a phonological contrast in voicing between velar stops in word-final
position, revealing itself in phonetic realisations. This is limited, however, to environments
following high vowels. Consider the following items as given in isolation:
(2.8)!hukl
!hug!
!hu![hukh]; [huk>]
[huW]; [huk>]

with final Ig! are also (and mainly) realised without a stop in isolation. They end in just a
vowel or an unreleased approximant following lui or a light palatal friction following Iii. The
(palato-)velar consonant does betray itself in the environment of a following consonant. For
example, preceding /hi, there is a contrast between !hukl 'hunt' and Itug! 'pound', as in (2.9).
The voiceless IkI is phonetically realised, the voiced Ig! is not.

=Thus, in careful speech h e made a difference between an unreleased versus a released velar stop: the former
was used for what he considered to be a final /g!, the latter for fkI. But as we have seen, final stops before a
pause may be realised either way, neutralising voice.","[32, 33]"

4. 7.3 Adverbial conjunctionsThe conjunctions to be discussed in this section are basically prepositions or they are built
on nominal markers. The clauses introduced by these conjunctions can be analyzed as
substitutes for nominal constituents. Hence, I characterise them as adverbial conjunctions.
They signal explicit cause or reason, purposive, conditional and temporal relations.
4. 7.3. 1 Causal leu(o)The preposition leu 'from' can have a predication as its object, which is given as a reason
for the preceding main clause, as in example (4.22 1 ).

order to'. I analyse leubinhyepo as built up from leu 'from' + bi 'INS' + ni-hyet '3SG-talk' +
po 'ANA(phoric) marker'. Occasionally, in fast speech, this complex is further reduced to
lenhyepo or nhyepo. Consider:

QII:2]While examples (4.23 1 ) and (4.232) convey a time frame ill!ring which the event
expressed by the main predication takes place, other temporal relations are expressed by big­
yo lene 'not-yet then', as in (4.205), where the reported second event chronologically
precedes the first one. For the situation where the event of the second predication is explicitly
marked as coming gfkr the first one, either leu api is used, as in (4.2 1 0), or leu ri no 'from

4. 7. 4 Complex conjunctionsWith demonstratives, gi forms substantives: gini 'the one here'; gima 'the one there' etc.
Compounded with th� Given marker ri and either the topic marker ne or the third person

chunks of texts, not just conjuncts within sentences. Consider gimarine in example (4 .234)
and gimarino in (4.23 5).","[143, 144, 145, 146]"

"But ri is not restricted to non-verbal predications. It also figures in sentences like (4.36) and
(4.37), which, in analogy to non-verbal predications, can be interpreted as being nominalised
by the presence of rio The declarative in (4.36) has the force of a command, while the ri­
marked clause in (4 . 3 7) forms a nominal to which the Topic marker ne can be applied with
an interrogative, i.e. rising, intonation.

"Alternatively, the verb bit 'accompany' is used, inflected for person-number of the first

the object of bit. Consider:

textual deixis. That is, they function in the domain of givenness and topichood or even
emphasis, contrast and focus. But these terms are not easily defined, and none of them seem
to be an adequate label for either ri or ne. Yet, for want of better terms, I have chosen GIVen
as gloss for ri, and TOPic for ne. Both of these words may carry stress.

Thereupon she stretched out her hand (and) with it she took a ripe sweet potato
(and) gave it to (them). 14 [Yairus 2 :0 1 9]If the instrument has not been introduced in a verbal clause, as was the case in examples
(4. 1 1 3) and (4. 1 1 4), but when it is given as a single N(P), linked to the main clause by ba
'and' or lene 'then', the main verb is obligatorily marked with an instrument affix:

(I had) one shotgun and with that I shot hawks and so on ... [Wonggor 1 :030]The Instrument prefix is liable to 'excessive use' by some speakers. That is, even when no
instrument has been mentioned in the preceding context, main verbs may be prefixed with bi­
to signal that an instrument is understood, as in:

4.5.3 Purposive verb sequencesIn contrast to Directional and Instrumental constructions, Purposives can be characterised
as Different Subject sequences. In many instances the sequence labeled 'purposive' can also
be interpreted as 'resultative', especially when the utterance refers to a past event, as in
example (4. 1 1 7). Later we will see that negation may sometimes favour a resultative
interpretation, and at other times a purposive one. In many cases the subject of the purposive
or resultative verb is the object of the first verb. Whether the result is expressed by a verb, as
in (4. 1 1 7), or an adjective, as in (4. 1 1 8), in both cases it needs to be marked with the
purposive clitic.'5 The (b) variants are unacceptable.
(4. 1 1 7) (a) Di-bui
napia
bi-mai.
I SG-hit wild.pig PUR-die
I killed the wild pig. (lit. I hit the wild pig dead.)
14Note that no '3SG' is part of the bimorphemic conjunction api-no, which conveys a slightly stronger sense
of (con-)sequence than api. Recall that third person singular has a zero subject prefix, hence the various
verbs in (4. 1 1 4) are all uninflected. Perhaps better: only bi-yai is uninflected, while the other verbs are
covertly inflected as revealed by another person category:

INS-takebikau
mui
di-yai
bak
yoni.
sw.potato
dry
I SG-take to
tham
I stretched my hand and with it I got a ripe sweet potato and gave it to them.
This clitic may be a weakened form of the preposition bak 'to, for', as suggested in §3.2.6. There are also
sentences where it seems to be interchangeable with the connective ba 'and'. To add another conjecture,
these two may well be related historically, if the elision of the final consonant is comparable to that of the
pronominal forms nok and yok to no and yo.","[117, 118]"

[yahag::lm]; [i�hag::lm][jih£t]

[yuhwen]Note that the palatal approximant of the stem /hyeT/ metathesises with !hi to be incorporated
in the unstressed syllable. This process seems optional for the bilabial approximant: [nuhen] is
attested as alternative to [nuhwen].
(e)Before /w/, Y takes the quality of a high back vowel, as in /wakl 'to marry':
[duwak]
[awak]
[nuwak]
[juwak]
[yuwak]2.7 Vocoid sequencesThe phonemic status of bilabial and palatal approximants as consonants can best be
argued if we consider which vocoid sequences Hatam allows. Only vocoid sequences
involving high vowels and non-high vowels in either order are attested, as presented in Table
2.3, with first elements in the rows and the second elements in the columns.
Table 2.3: Yocoid sequences
eaauIeia10IUeeieuaalauaaiauuuiueuauaThe illustrative items are given in the established orthography, phonological shape and
phonetic realisations: see examples (2.24)-(2 .28). The actual phonetic realisations differ
considerably, to a large extent depending on the place a word has in an utterance. In isolation,
sequences with [+ HIGH] in second position always form one syllable, as illustrated in (2.24).
Since no further consonant is allowed in the coda, the high vowels could be interpreted as
consonantal approximants. 1 1 This also holds for y [HIGH ] as only onset, as in (2.25).

"As conveyed by the free translations of examples (4. 1 05) and (4. 1 06), the sequence with
directional verb as y2 seems to function more as a unit than when y2 is some other verb, as
in (4. 1 09). Although [V I = transitive + y2= directional] appears to form a tight sequence,
Hatam does not allow a tighter sequence of action + motion verb with the object of y l after
,
the motion verb: *di-ttei kwei srat 'I-carry come letter .l2 The unweakened form ba 'and' is
allowed in such sequences, as long as the verb following the connective is marked for person­
number of the subject, indicating it has the same referent as the verb preceding it. Thus, a
natural, i.e. unelicited, sentence as in example (4. 1 1 Oa) has various alternative realisations:

Then he shot (Pig) again and called us together and we carried (it). And we
came and roasted (it). [Wonggor 1 :056]The first sentence in (4. 1 1 Oa) ends with ni-ttei carrying a final falling intonation, followed
by a (long) pause. It is also possible to merge the two sentences into one, resulting in a
sequence of three verbs, of which only the first one is prefixed. The reason why these three
verbs are asyndetically linked, it seems, is that the second verb is directional kwei. It is
uninflected because it is y2 specifying direction for the transitive verb ttei 'carry', and it is
y l with respect to bam 'roast':

"In subject position, forms derived from the suffixed pronouns are found, with the final
vowel elided: dan 'I' or jen 'you.PL', and so on. The third person pronouns nok and yok are
mainly used with the meaning 'like that' . ' Whereas no was rejected in favor of noni and the
plural form yok was accepted as direct object in example (3 .4), they were both accepted as
object of the preposition in (3.5).

"3.5 AdjectivesIt is not easy to find criteria to distinguish adjectives as a separate word class in Hatam.
There are no clear morphological differences, but some syntactic processes do warrant a
distinction. Some examples of typical adjectives are given in example (3 . 8 1 ). Adjectives and
verbs can both be used predicatively, needing a prefix to index person-number of the subject,
which is zero for third person singular, as in (3.82) and (3. 83).
