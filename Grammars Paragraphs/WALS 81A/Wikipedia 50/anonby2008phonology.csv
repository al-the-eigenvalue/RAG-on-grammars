"10.1.1 Constituent order
In Anonby (2005:8–13), constituent order in Mambay is detailed, and the effects of
changes in order are also examined. In the present study, a basic summary is provided.
In Mambay, the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly
SVO (subject–verb–object).

recipient. Two strategies are available in such situations, and in both cases, the more
salient object in the discourse follows the other object. If the more salient object is a
patient, it simply follows the recipient:
Ø

3:PFV give:PFVmí
sò lá
1SG.OBJ axehe/she/it gave me an axeIf the more salient object is a recipient, it is introduced after the patient with the
preposition yâg ‘to, for.’

3:PFV give:PFVsò lá yâg mí
he/she/it gave me an axe
axe
to 1SG.OBJIn both cases, object pronouns (6.1.3.1) are used for a pronominal recipient.
Subsequent to the SVO complex, the following order is exhibited: directional adverb –
locative (spatial or temporal) adverbial complement – aspectual or descriptive adverbial
complement – particle. Examples which illustrate this ordering are as follows:

Discourse-orienting elements such as topic nouns, modal adverbs (7.6.1.2) and
connective locational (spatial and temporal) constructions are placed before the SVO
complex.

A small number of particles are used in reference to clauses and clause constituents.
(Particles which are used to define relations between clauses are discussed separately in
10.2.2).
Unlike adverbs, which are minimally comprised of a heavy syllable, clause- and clause
constituent-modifying particles uniformly exhibit a light (CV) syllable.
These particles fall into three groups: Indicative particles, Optative particles, and an
attributive copula ká. While Indicative particles are treated in the present section,
Optative particles are described in the chapter on verbs (7.6.1.1.2), and the attributive
copula is described in the context of verbless clauses (10.1.3.2).
Four Indicative particles are found in Mambay:
nà
yó
yá
rè(question particle; see also 4.4.2.3)
(affirmative particle)
(negative particle)
(topicalization particle)Indicative particles are used in reference to clauses as well as clause constituents. Since
the core of a clause is prototypically a verb, applying a particle to a verbal clause is
formally and functionally equivalent to applying it to the verb (see 7.6.1.1 for examples).
In the following section, each of the Indicative particles is shown (whenever attested) in a
verbless clause, with an Indicative verb, and with at least one other clause constituent.
10.1.2.1 The question particle nà
When the question particle nà is juxtaposed with a noun, an interrogative clause results.

Kwe QMis it Kwe?","[448, 449, 450]"
"A final section provides anChapter 6, which is concerned with pronouns, is an appropriate transition between
chapter 5 on nouns and chapter 7, which is concerned with verbs. While, prototypically,
pronouns take the place of nominal referents, they also play an important role in the
verbal system, where they bear TAM (tense, aspect and mode) distinctions. The larger
part of the chapter is concerned with the basic categories of personal pronouns
distinguished in Mambay: subject, object and possessive pronouns. Each of these
pronoun types also has emphatic forms produced by various strategies. A final section
deals with interrogative pronouns.
Chapter 7 examines verbs. First, canonical morphologically simple stems are examined.
This is followed by a discussion of non-canonical stems, most of which are
morphologically complex; the most prominent group of non-canonical stems contain
verbal extensions. A description of verb word morphology then leads into a discussion of
verbal inflection, which is marked on the verb word, subject pronouns and by means of
expanded verb forms, including those which incorporate auxiliary verbs and TAM
adverbs and particles. A final section describes composite verbal expressions: these are
constructions composed of a verb stem recurrently found with another element (noun,
prepositional phrase, etc.) in the lexicon.
Chapter 8 deals with two classes of modifiers: adverbs and adjectives. Since ideophones
comprise a majority of adverbs as well as adjectives, they are also treated in this chapter
as a parallel topic with major implications for both of these word classes. One striking
trait of ideophones in Mambay is the existence of several derivational ideophonic
templates. Apart from ideophones, directional and TAM adverbs as well as a poorly
defined group of non-ideophonic adjectives are addressed.
Chapter 9 brings together three minor word classes, all of which are closed in the lexicon:
numerals, demonstratives and prepositions. Numerals in particular are morphologically
diverse; a small group of underived numerals is found, but many numerals are derived
from other parts of speech, especially nouns.
Chapter 10 serves to introduce the structure of clauses and clause combinations. The
section on clause structure, which comes first, deals with constituent order, clause and
clause constituent particles and verbless clauses; independent utterances other than
clauses are also considered. The section on clause combinations then concentrates on
strategies of coordination and subordination, giving special attention to conjunctions and
particles.
At the end of this study, a collection of five texts is transcribed and interlinearized. These
texts have been selected from a variety of genres—song, proverb, legend (account of
origins), and fable—in order to illustrate a range of morphological, syntactic and
discourse structures. In addition, there are two appendices: Appendix 1 provides an27inventory of inalienable possession paradigms, and Appendix 2 presents conjugations of
verbal inflection as it patterns with contrastive tonal verb classes.
One theme that is recurrently invoked in the description is that of canonicity.
Phonological structures from some of the word classes fall between two ends of a
continuum: canonical and non-canonical.
Canonical structures belong to the
homogeneous phonological core of the language and represent the vast majority of
structures in the language. However, there are small but persistent groups of marked and
highly varied structures in all of the lexically open word classes; and often, non-canonical
roots exhibit a cluster of uncommon features. The sections which discuss canonicity
reveal that some non-canonical structures, such as nasalized mid vowels (3.1.1), are
attested only a handful of times in the data. Words borrowed from other languages
usually exhibit the same behaviour as other non-canonical items in the same class (e.g.,
5.2.2.3, 7.1.2.3). In later chapters, canonicity is considered in reference to the following
topics:
- geminate consonants (2.1.2.7);
- repetition of consonants within a syllable (2.1.2.8);
- distribution of vowels within morphemes (2.2.2.3);
- syllable weight (2.4.3);
- inventory of nasalized vowels (3.1);
- noun CV structure (5.2.1.1) and tone melody (5.1.1.2);
- noun-to-noun derivation with prefixes (5.1.2.3.1);
- linked form (5.2.2.2) and plurality (5.5.1.1) templates;
- verb stem structure (7.1);
- ideophones (8.2; see also 5.11 and 7.1.2.2); and
- prepositions vs. locational nouns (9.3.3).
The Fulfulde examples given in the text have been verified using SIL (2003) and Noye
(1974), and Hausa examples are from Abraham and Mai Kano (1949) and Maarten
Kossmann (pers. comm. 2007).","[44, 45]"
"7.4.2.2 Subjunctive constructions with kà
Optative verb forms are also found in subjunctive constructions with the adverbializer kà
‘when, and then’ (10.2.2.2). Semantically, a purpose clause (‘so that, in order to’) results
from the combination of kà and the Optative verb form. The structure of the Optative in
this context is the same as that found in main clauses (7.4.2.1).
Examples of Optative verb forms used with kà are as follows:
Ø
kuF’4zì4rú

7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:356mì pàg4rú

Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"10.1 Clauses
The following aspects of clause structure are covered in this section: constituent order
(10.1.1), clause and clause constituent particles (10.1.2), verbless clauses (10.1.3) and
single-word utterances (10.1.4).",[448]
"8.2 Ideophones
In Mambay, it is appropriate to distinguish ideophones as a morphological reality.
However, this grouping is “not on a par” with other word classes in the language, which
are for the most part self-contained and which exhibit an essentially uniform syntactic
distribution (cf. Newman 2000:249, contra Cole 1955:370). Instead, it is an open “superclass” (cf. Welmers 1973:462, Ameka 2001:26, Elders 2001:97) whose members are
spread among four word classes: adverbs, adjectives, nouns, and verbs. While
ideophones dominate the classes of adverbs and adjectives, they are only moderately
attested among nouns and verbs.
The present study grapples with the morphological classification of ideophones in
Mambay and provides a description of their structure. This focus, coupled with the
richness of the topic in general, has precluded a satisfactory treatment of related topics
such as the semantics of ideophones, the relationship of structural features to perceived384realities, and the role of ideophones in discourse.
comments are in order.","[401, 402]"
"However, a couple of generalIdeophones, sometimes referred to as phonaesthemes (Dimmendaal 2000:183),
distinguish themselves from other morphemes and words primarily in the way that they
refer and mean. They transcend the arbitrary sound-symbol relationship characteristic of
most lexical items and enrich discourse by dramatizing salient real-world phenomena as
they are perceived by users of the language (Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:3): they are
“descriptive of sound, colour, smell, manner, appearance, state, action or intensity…vivid
vocal images or representations of visual, auditory and other sensory or mental
experiences” (Cole 1955:370).
In Mambay, the distinctive structure of ideophones, which often deviates from canonical
structural characteristics of the classes in which they are found (cf. Welmers 1973:462,
Elders 2001:98–100), is generated by these perceptions. As the later sections of the
chapter demonstrate, structural repetition is perhaps the most salient feature to result, and
is an important component of morphological structure as well as derivational processes.
Also, ideophones make significant use of intonation, more so than other words (4.4.1; cf.
Newman 2000:242).
At the level of discourse, ideophones are a basic means of establishing the importance of
an entity or an action. Anonby (2005:15) points out that in Mambay, the simple presence
of an ideophone highlights an element within a discourse; conversely, only important
elements are accompanied by ideophones (this is evident in all of the longer texts found
at the end of this study). This tendency is especially evident in the climax of stories,
where each verb is characteristically accompanied by an ideophone (p. 16). In addition to
its presence, the way in which an ideophone is presented is an important means of
marking emphasis. In particular, this presentation allows the speaker to regulate the
degree of emphasis. For example, the pitch intervals signalling tonal register raising and
lowering (4.4.1) are more drastic with ideophones than with other words. Further,
repetition (e.g. 8.4.2.1.2, 8.5) and lengthening of segments (e.g. 7.1.2.2, 8.5.3), which are
used as a means of echoing real-world phenomena (cf. Doke 1935:118–9, Watters
2000:196), starkly underscore the discourse elements to which the ideophones affected by
these processes relate.
In the present section, methodological issues relating to the description of ideophones are
addressed in further detail. The remainder of the chapter is then devoted to the structural
description of ideophonic adverbs (8.3), adjectives (which appear to be inherently
ideophonic; see 8.4) and a description of derivational issues pertinent to ideophones (8.5).
Ideophonic nouns and verbs are treated elsewhere (5.11 and 7.1.2.2), but the principles
presented in this section are applicable for these morphological subclasses.
Methodological issues
Rather than attempting an exhaustive analysis of ideophones in Mambay, the present
chapter provides a basic descriptive framework for an intricate but indistinctly structured385area of the language. The study of ideophones in Mambay is problematic, and several
methodological comments are in order.
First of all, ideophones are difficult to elicit (cf. Welmers 1973:461). Initially, the
researcher encounters the perception among speakers of a language that since ideophones
are poorly represented in the written languages with which they are familiar, they are
irrelevant as linguistic data. Once this idea has been countered, a deeper issue remains:
the relationship of ideophones to larger texts. A basic function of ideophones is to enrich
texts, and ideophones are inseparable from these texts (Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:3).
Whereas an inevitably small inventory of ideophones based on an French or English
wordlist might suggest that they are peripheral to the language, an examination of natural
speech, including texts such as those found at the end of this study, shows that they are
integral to both the structure and the flavour of discourse (as mentioned in 8.2 above).
Secondly, unlike other morphological classes, usage of ideophones varies considerably
from one person to another, and outside the context of discourse, speakers of the
language are often unable to determine the meaning of ideophones used by people from
other clans or villages (cf. Childs 2001:67–70). In the ideophonic lexicon, both the
words used as well as the meanings of these words are variable among speakers. And
even where people concur on the form and meaning of a given ideophone, they may
differ regarding its admissibility in the various host word classes (adverb, adjective, noun
and verb; see especially 8.5.6). Numerous speakers of Mambay have been involved in
this study of ideophones; however, in order to cope with the complexity of the
information, this chapter relies on data gathered from the researcher’s primary language
assistant.
Thirdly, it is difficult to draw a line between those words in a given class which are
ideophonic and those which are not (Welmers 1973:460). Transparent sound symbolism
and, secondarily, non-canonical structures provide a basis for deciding what is
ideophonic. In the present analysis, such words are used as structural templates for the
comparison of words whose ideophonic qualities are more difficult to establish.
The following example serves as a case in point. As stated above, ideophones dominate
the word classes of adverb and adjective (cf. 8.2, introductory discussion). However,
except in the case of directional adverbs (and to some degree, TAM adverbs), it is
difficult to identify any adverbs or adjectives which are not ideophonic. Quantifiers
(adverbial or adjectival) such as the following might be expected to distinguish
themselves formally from ideophonic qualifiers:
bî’
yâN7
gáb
lôNw
té%éa bit, slowly, almost
halfway (measured horizontally)
halfway (measured vertically)
very, much
completely, all, whole, together386However, in the language these quantifiers exhibit the non-canonical characteristics of
ideophones outlined in the discussion above (e.g., non-canonical structure, repetition and
repeatability, and highly variable intonation).
It is clear that ideophones present some fundamental challenges to morphological
classification. In the following sections, ideophones whose identity is unambiguous
(based on syntactic limitations) provide a structural framework for the consideration of a
given class. However, morphological ambivalence is an important feature of ideophones
in Mambay, and flexibility in class membership is revisited in (8.5.6) below.","[402, 403, 404]"
"191.2.3.1 Multilingualism
Mambay is situated in the north-central African linguistic “core,” at the crossroads of
three linguistic phyla (Niger-Congo, Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan) and host to myriad
sub-families. While genetic diversity is high, contact among languages impacts their
composition to a remarkable degree (Thomas 1972, Greenberg 1983:4).
Most Mambay speakers are proficient in at least one other language. The most common
languages of multilingualism are (in order of decreasing frequency) Fulfulde (the
language of the Fulbe), French and Mundang. Proficiency in Hausa and Arabic, two
other languages of multilingualism, is limited to a small minority of men (Hamm
2001:12).
In the Mambay language area, as throughout most of Northern Cameroon, the dominance
of Fulfulde is an inescapable part of the sociolinguistic equilibrium. This dominance is
the result of a century and a half of Fulbe hegemony (1.1.3.2–1.1.3.4); it has steadily
increased among the Mambay, with the possible exception of the last decade, since the
ethnic community has begun to show interest in the preservation of their language
(1.2.3.2). Even in interethnic encounters involving groups other than Fulbe, Fulfulde is
almost always used as a language of wider communication.
Proficiency in French is, unsurprisingly, correlated to level of education in the Frenchlanguage school systems of Cameroon and Chad. Because Mambay men have, on
average, a higher level of education than women, bilingualism in French is generally
limited to men (Hamm 2001:12–3).
Interestingly, proficiency in additional languages is also correlated to religious adherence.
The Mambay view Fulfulde as an Islamic language, and while Arabic is used for prayer,
imams in the area use Fulfulde for religious teaching; use of Mambay (or any language
other than Arabic or Fulfulde) is discouraged for Muslims in religious contexts. Because
of this, Mambay who are Muslim tend to be more proficient in Fulfulde than those who
are Christian (Hamm 2001:11–2).
In contrast, Mambay who consider themselves Christian (particularly those who are
protestant) generally have a higher level of proficiency in Mundang than those who are
Muslim. This is particularly true of Mambay Christians living on the Chad side of the
border because until recently, Mundang was the primary language used there in Christian
celebrations.
Finally, geographic proximity to other language areas is related to multilingualism:
proficiency in Mundang is more common in Chad, where the Mambay and Mundang
language areas are adjacent to one another (Hamm 2001:12). Still, although Grimes
(2000a:68) states that Mambay “speakers are reported to understand Mundang,” Hamm
demonstrates that even among the Mambay population in Chad, average proficiency in
Mundang is low (2001:12).","[36, 37]"

form may be used with no change in meaning. Variation between the forms is likely
sociolinguistic rather than linguistic, reflecting a process of contraction that is taking
place; however, the precise factors influencing usage have not been identified (see also

Members of a set of reflexive object pronouns are used whenever the object of a simple
clause is co-referential with its subject. Similar to what is found in many other African
languages (Watters 2000:213), reflexive object pronouns in Mambay are composed of the
noun )ínù ‘body, self’ and an inalienable possessive pronoun (6.1.4.2). Reflexive object
pronouns are as follows:

semantic participants in a transitive verb construction. However, they achieve this using
different strategies: while reflexive suffixes result in the detransitivization of a transitive
verb (7.3.2.1.2), reflexive object pronouns satisfy transitivity requirements by supplying
the transitive verb with an object. The detransitivization strategy is only moderately277productive and is often accompanied by semantic shift (7.3.2.1.2), but the use of reflexive
objects is fully productive.

to follow; see the previous section and 7.4.3.1.2. This object is not shown in present

differ from the segmental content of the corresponding verb stems. Seven of the eight
exceptions are derived from verbs comprised of a C(C)V syllable, which does not meet
the minimal two-mora weight requirement for nouns (5.1.1.1). It appears, therefore, that
g has for the most part been inserted as a compensatory measure. These verbal nouns are
as follows:

stems. Regular verbal nouns exhibit two possible melodies: L and HL. Regular verbal
nouns with L tone may be derived from verbs with either H-toned (Class 1) or L-toned
(Class 4; see 7.3.2.2.1) stems.

The apparently polar tonal behaviour of 4na is addressed in the following subsection
(5.9.1.1.1). This is followed by a discussion of the function of regular verbal nouns as
Imperfective verb forms (5.9.1.1.2).
5.9.1.1.1 Tonal behaviour of 4na
A simple explanation for the polar tonal behaviour of 4na has not been reached.
However, it is probable that it underlyingly bears a contour (HL or LH) melody.
It is possible that 4na is underlying HL. If this is the case, its melody is fused with that
of L-toned verbal nouns as follows:

%â%+
+4nâ
4nâûl4ná
%â%4nádividing (something)
sowing (something)This implies the deletion of the final L tone of 4nâ, which never surfaces with a HL
verbal noun. Since, in these examples, there are only three tone-bearing units on the
resulting verbal noun word, it is not unreasonable to posit the lexical deletion of an
excess fourth tone (cf. 4.3.1.4). Comparable situations are attested elsewhere in the
language (e.g., a HLH melody on two-mora nouns; see 4.1.2.2). However, in stems with
sufficient tone-bearing units, there is no evidence that this hypothetical final L tone is
ever associated.

accepted. First of all (similar to what is described in the HL explanation above), the
melody of HL verbal nouns would have to have fused with that of the LH suffix 4naF,
resulting in a single HLH word.
ûl
%â%+
+4naF

sowing (something)The LH identity of 4na would be more difficult to account for with the other (“L-toned”)
verbal nouns. It is possible that the underlying tone of what are described above as Ltoned verbal nouns is actually LH, even though the H portion of the melody only surfaces
when
4na replaces the explicit object. The loss of the LH verb’s H tone when
accompanied by an explicit object would be seen as parallel to the attested loss of any LH
possessed noun’s H tone in the context of the possessive construction (see 5.2.2.1). If
this were the case, the verbal noun data throughout would be re-presented as follows:
verbal nounverbal noun w/ explicit objectfòó
gbuFgfòò …
gbùg …spying (something)
throwing (something)The result of affixation with 4naF would be as follows:
fòó
gbuFg+
+4naF
4naFfòó4nà
gbuFg4nà230spying (something)
throwing (something)Still, the final H of 4naF never surfaces. But since there are only three morae on the
resulting verbal noun word, and since (in contrast to HLH verbal noun words; see above)
there are no examples in the data of LHL verbal noun words with more tone-bearing units
than this, it is not unreasonable to posit the lexical deletion of an excess fourth tone
(4.3.1.1). Comparable situations are attested elsewhere in the language (e.g., a three-tone
melody on two-mora nouns; see 4.1.2.2).
An underlying H melody for 4na is harder to defend, but should also be considered. As
in the previous hypothesis, affixation with HL nouns would be straightforward.

H-toned:

gbuFgfòò …
gbùg …spying (something)
throwing (something)With LH verbal nouns, it is possible that Meeussen’s rule (see Meeussen 1965:110 and
Goldsmith 1984) causes a H-toned 4ná suffix to be realized as L after H:
fòó
gbuFg+
+4ná
4náfòó4nà
gbuFg4nàspying (something)
throwing (something)The major weakness of this explanation is that such a process has not been observed
elsewhere in the language (merging of H tones is the norm in other phonological words;
for an example, look at inalienable noun-pronoun constructions in 5.3.4.2.4.1).
Because of the complexity of these arguments, the tonal identity of 4na is accounted for
throughout as part of lexical HLH and LHL melodies on words composed of a verbal
noun + 4na.
5.9.1.1.2 Imperfective function of regular verbal nouns
Apart from their basic nominal status, regular verbal nouns function as Imperfective verb
forms (7.4.1.1.2).","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"

TONE AND INTONATION
4TONE AND INTONATIONLike the vast majority of Niger-Congo languages, Mambay is tonal. All syllables in all
utterances are affected by tone, and its behaviour in the language is systematic.
In the context of a rich inventory of consonants, vowels, syllable and word shapes, and
contrastive nasality (Chapters 2 and 3), the functional load of tone in distinguishing
lexical items within word classes is moderate, and minimal tone pairs within classes are
surprisingly uncommon. However, its role in the language is much broader than this.
Among other things, tone is an important means of distinguishing among word classes
(4.1.2.4). In addition, tone plays a central role in the verbal system, where it is used as a
basic means of TAM (tense/aspect/mode) marking (7.3.2.2). Further, tone is sensitive to
boundaries of phonological phrases (4.3); the resulting limitation of tonal processes in
phrase-final position helps provide pragmatic coherence and contrast in discourse.
Two contrastive tone levels are found in Mambay: H (high) and L (low). Tones from
these two levels are organized into contrastive tone melodies and associated with
morphemes or, in some cases, phonological words (4.1).
Additional structural aspects of the tone system include floating tones, replacive tone
melodies, and interaction between tone and other phonological structures (4.2).
Four major processes affect the tone system. While tone deletion is a lexical process,
postlexical processes consist of downstep, H tone spread and L tone spread (4.3).
In addition to a complete tonal system, two important intonational phenomena are
attested in Mambay: tone register shift (which is different than downstep) and an
expectation marker. Both interact closely with the tone system (4.4).
Terminology and transcription
Whenever phonologically contrastive tonal elements are under discussion, the terms
“tone” and “tone melody” are used. In contrast, the term “pitch” is limited to phonetic
descriptions of tonal realizations.
Regarding the transcription of tone, several comments are in order. For typographical
reasons, the phonological orthography used in this study consistently limits tone marking
to orthographic vowels; the tone marked on vowels is thus applicable to the whole118syllable. This convention is pertinent for syllables with a VC coda, which have two tonebearing units (2.4.3). In cases where the tonal value of the coda C is different than that of
the preceding V, it is transcribed on the V as follows:
underlying
simplified
phonological phonological
form
orthographyexample/ká7`/
/kùmi/bowstring, drum snare
baobabkâ7
kuFmThis convention also applies to pharyngealized and glottalized vowels (whether
phonologically long or short; see 2.2.1, 2.3.3.2–3), which are represented with Vh and V’
in the phonological orthography.

"9.3 Prepositions
Although members of several word classes in Mambay are used for locational functions,
prepositions are the only class devoted to these functions. True prepositions, which are
found as heads of prepositional phrases, constitute a closed word class of only seven
items. Of these, two appear to be borrowed. Mambay prepositions are, in alphabetical
order:
bèè
háá ~ háá
lâ’
má
sáà
sé’ ~ séQ
yâgwithout
until, up to, all the way to (cf. Fulfulde haa, Mundang há$á)
like, as
with, and, by, during
inside, in
except, only, not until (cf. Fulfulde sey)
to, forAll seven prepositions are monosyllabic. While the commonly used preposition má
‘with, and, by, during’ is comprised of a light syllable, the other prepositions are
comprised of a heavy syllable (cf. 2.4.3).
The structure and syntactic distribution of prepositional phrases are presented in 9.3.1 and
9.3.2. The use of other word classes for locational functions is discussed in 9.3.3; there,
the distribution of these classes is contrasted with that of prepositions.",[442]
"7.4.2 Optative
The Optative mood is attested in three contexts. In main clauses, a general Optative
function prevails; prototypically, it communicates an imperative intention (7.4.2.1). It is
also found in subjunctive constructions following the subordinating conjunction kà
(7.4.2.2), and in subjunctive constructions formed with the causative auxiliary pá ‘make,
do’ (7.4.2.3). Negative forms of the Optative are discussed in 7.5.
7.4.2.1 In main clauses
Optative verb forms are most commonly found in main clauses. In this context, a general
Optative function applies, expressing a wish on the part of the speaker.
Typologically, Mambay stands out in that it has no verb form marked specifically for an
imperative function. Instead, Optative verb forms in main clauses prototypically
communicate an imperative intention—the idea that a member or members of an
audience must do something (cf. Bybee 1985:171, Payne 1997:303, Crystal 2003:227,
Palmer 2001:80). Most frequently, this audience is the second person (singular or plural),
and the illocutionary force is that of a command (“you…!, you must….”).
However, in Mambay the audience of a command may also be the first or the third person
(sample descriptions for which an imperative function has been described for all
pronominal persons are Robertson 1934:320–30, Lakoff 1968:172–6; Roberts 1990:369
and Mounce 1994:143–8; cf. also Palmer 2001:81, who discusses the theoretical352implications of such a system). For forms in which the first person is a speaker, orders
are given to oneself (the first person singular) or a group of which one is a part (first
person plural and 1&2 person forms); for the singular, this has the force of resolve (“let
me…,” “I must…”), and for the plural, exhortation (“let us…,” “we must…”),
respectively. For the third person (singular or plural), the Optative expresses the idea that
an audience which is not being directly addressed must do something; this carries an
obligative (“he/she/it must…”) force. For all three persons, the formal expression of
imperative constructions is equivalent; there is no formally discrete second person
conjugation (cf. Dimmendaal 2000:175, Watters 2000:203, who note that in most
languages the subject pronoun is omitted for second person imperatives).
More broadly, Mambay speakers use the Optative to communicate intentions other than
those which are strictly imperative. For example, third person Optative verb forms may
express a jussive (“may he/she/it”) force. Other more specific functions (for example,
suggestion or imploring) are expressed by using TAM indicators in conjunction with the
Optative forms (7.6.1).
Optative verb forms are found with all of the pronominal persons (cf. 6.1.1), and in all
cases a subject pronoun is obligatory. The Optative is structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbOptative pronoun (CV)stem (Optative tone) (+ optional reflexive suffix)ex. mí
hèè
1SG:OPT climb:OPTlet me climb! / I must climbmá
hèè
3SG:OPT climb:OPTlet them climb! / they must climbró

"442Note the use of the second person object pronoun (cf. 6.1.1) for the quotation addressee
in the final example (see also Anonby 2005:42).
10.2.2.2 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are used to express a range of adverbial information pertaining to a
main clause. Attested functions include time, purpose, concession and condition. The
following adverbializers are used introduce these adverbial clauses:
kà
kò
kóò
má4kì4nàáwhen, if; and then, before, so that, in order to
when, if
even if, whether
while, when, even though (cf. má ‘with, and,’ kì4 ‘place, situation,’
nàá (relativizer))As the subsequent discussion shows, all of the adverbializers are found clause-initially.
The adverbializer kà functions differently depending on where the subordinate clause in
which it occurs is placed. When the subordinate clause comes before the main clause, kà
means ‘when’ (simultaneous time) or ‘if’ (condition). In this position, it is only attested
in the data with Indicative verb forms.

However, when the subordinate clause follows the main clause, kà means ‘and then,
before’ (sequential time; with an Indicative verb form) or ‘so that’ (purpose; with an
Optative verb form).

and.thenmí
mûn
1SG.OPT come:OPT:to.hereI will eat first so that I might come
The adverbializer kò differs from kà in that it is only found in subordinate clauses that
precede the main clause. There, it performs the same function as kà, meaning ‘when’ or
‘if.’

The adverbializer kò is also distinctive in that, unlike kà, it has an emphatic counterpart
kóò ‘even if’ (concession and condition). If kóò is used with more than one coordinated
construction, it carries the sense ‘whether.’

One final adverbializer, which is found before a sentence-initial subordinate clause, is
má4kì4nàá (lit. ‘with-[the]place-that’). It typically means ‘while, when’ (simultaneous
time).","[459, 460, 461]"
"5.7.1 Male/generic participant nouns
Male/generic participant noun constructions are formed by inserting the noun páà ‘man,
father, owner’ in the possessed-noun position of a possessive construction. The
prototypical usage of páà as an alienable noun is that of ownership:
páà )ígà
man:LF thingownerAlthough páà is typically used for male referents, and Mambay speakers consistently
give the gloss ‘man, father,’ it may also be used generically:
páà bîn
man:LF anotheranother person (male or female)páà só’lí )ì4vínà
man:LF greatness:LF HEAD-womanfemale boss (cf. páà só’lé ‘master, lord’)A wide representation of syntactic possibilities is found with male/generic participant
nouns, which comprise about two-thirds of the participant nouns in the data. Participant
noun constructions composed of páà and a typical (i.e., non-verbal) noun are illustrated
by the following examples:

Female participant noun constructions may be formed in one of two ways: by inserting
the noun vínà ‘woman’ or its respect form (cf. 5.8.2) tí4vínà in the possessed-noun
position of a possessive construction; or by attaching an augmentative/female prefix tí4
(cf. 5.8.2) to a noun.

Non-human participant noun constructions are formed by inserting the noun )ígà ‘thing’
in the possessed-noun position of a possessive construction.
Almost all non-human participant noun constructions in the data involve a verbal noun
derived from a transitive verb. The participant )ígà can be the subject or object of a
verbal noun. Subject status is evident in the following constructions:
)îg bù’ dígnù
thing:LF gather.up:VN livernausea)îg kàm zírmìn

Participant nouns employ various pluralization and collective strategies, depending on
whether they are male/generic, female or non-human.
The male/generic participant páà may not be pluralized. Instead, Mambay speakers use
collective constructions with the generic human collective participant tìì (= tì + )ì; see
5.6.1) ‘those [who are] of’:

butchers
COLL:HEAD cut:VN animal/meatThe female participant (tí4)vínà ~ tí4 has two possibilities available. If the female
identity of the participants is significant, the plural noun (tí4)gérêm (an irregular plural
of (tí4) vínà; see 5.5.2.2) is employed ((tí4)vínà is used in the examples here, but its
short form
tí4 is equivalent; see 5.7.2).

which are often not countable (5.5.1.2). In such cases, the noun resists pluralization, and
no collective construction is available (cf. the human collective participant in the
examples earlier in this section).

Diminutive and augmentative strategies are both available in Mambay. While diminutive
derivations (5.8.1) employ compounding (5.4), augmentative derivations (5.8.2) employ
prefixation (5.1.2).","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240]"
"10.1.2.3 The negative particle yá
Negation is always signalled by the clause-final negative particle yá along with some
additional indicator. For negation of an equivalence clause, yá is found in conjunction
with a third person negative non-Perfective pronoun híì (6.1.2.6) in initial subject
position.

bethe chief is there / there is a chiefThe negative particle yá is most commonly found with verbs (7.6.1.1.1) and, like the
other Indicative particles, is found clause-finally; the marking of negation in this position
is an areal feature (Watters 2000:207). Here, yá is accompanied by a modification of the
structure of subject pronouns, which mark realis value (see 6.1.2).

those applied to subject pronouns signal that negation concerns an object rather than the
verb or clause. This negation has the effect of focus on the object, and indicates that the
object is different item than the one which the listener expects. In the following cases,
the object’s final syllable is lengthened and a low tone is associated with it.

10.1.2.4 The topicalization particle rè
The prototypical use of the particle rè is to strongly topicalize constituents, that is, to
centralize relevant known information in the context of a discourse (cf. 7.6.1.1.1).

Another important use of rè is as a floor-holding device (cf. Payne 1997:358): it shows
that a speaker intends to continue an utterance (cf. the expectancy marker in 4.2.2).

Mambay (Niger-Congo, Adamawa)Erik John AnonbyAcknowledgmentsThis book is dedicated to Ti’za Christina, star of the Ramadan moon, who endured my
dream of Africa and made it come true; and to Tinaga Parisa and Kyahrimi Nisse, my
hot-blooded little Mambay girls.
The present research on Mambay was conducted for a doctoral programme in the
Department of African Languages and Cultures at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Fieldwork was funded within the context of a language development consultancy jointly
administered by SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon. Authorization for field research was
granted by MINREST (the Ministère de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) of
Cameroon, permit 006/MINREST/B00/D00/D11.
I wish to thank my colleagues at Leiden University for their insight, humour, and
encouragement, in particular Christian Rapold, Maarten Kossmann, and K’es Mulugeta
Seyoum.
I thank my colleagues of SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon, many of whom contributed in
specific ways to the success this research and the enjoyment of our work together: Padeu
Dakouli, Diane Friesen, Marti Giger, Caroline Grant, Jeff Heath, Jérémie Mondy Mégay,
Julien Tchékoua, Bruce Jakeway, Gideon Noussi, Edward and Diane Tong, and Liz
Williams. Discussions on a wide range of linguistic topics with Jim Roberts, Lukas
Neukom and Richard Gravina were constructive. Vaughn and Mary Ohlman helped us
greatly during times of sickness.
I appreciated academic exchange with many other people working in the field.
Assessments of aspects of the present research by Roger Blench, John Esling, Ken Olson,
Cho Jun-Mo and Gordon Tisher were beneficial. In particular, Stefan Elders (deceased)
did all he could to ensure that I was well-prepared for fieldwork on Mambay by
furnishing me with numerous resources which would have been otherwise difficult to
locate, by sharing his own field notes on Mambay, by involving me in his other works-inprogress in the field of Adamawa languages. Paul Eguchi similarly laid the foundation
for the present research through his previous work on Mambay, and encouraged me to
engage in this field of study. I also thank Keith Snider for fostering in me a sense of
wonder and love of language, especially in the areas of phonology and tone, and so for
inspiring me to pursue further studies in African linguistics. His comments on the tone
chapter of the present research were invaluable.iiAu Cameroun, nous avons apprécié l’accueil que nous avons reçu dans chaque secteur.
Nous reconnaissons les administrateurs tels que le préfet de Guider, le sous-préfet de
Guider, le sous-préfet de Figuil et son adjoint. En plus, nous avons apprécié la sécurité
qu’ont pourvue la gendarmerie et le poste de police de Figuil.
D’autres personnes qui ont enrichi notre séjour à Figuil sont nos frères de la congrégation
EFL à Figuil, les pères à la mission catholique de Figuil (en particulier le père Vladislav),
le patron de Figuil Pierre Roca, et le directeur de l’École de Kolléré.
Parmi les Mambay, nous avons connu un accueil chaleureux depuis le premier moment.
En effet, le pays mambay nous est devenu un foyer. Les chefs des villages mambay nous
ont ouvert la porte au peuple : nous nous sommes présentés devant les chefs de Beepahna
(Biparé), Kaakaala (Kakala), Kaakyo’w (Katchéo), Kaaku’ (Kakou), Bisooli (Bissolé) et
Kaaguma (Kagouma), et nous avons reçu leur bénédiction. D’autres chefs nous ont
accueillis depuis leurs sièges.
Arrivés au pays mambay, c’était d’abord chez Swahy Kada Moïse que nous nous sommes
installés. Il nous à considéré comme ses enfants, et pour nos propres enfants il était
dazwa’ ‘grand-père.’ Nous le remercions pour son partage de lui-même et de sa famille.
C’était un grand privilège de pouvoir travailler avec la direction (ancienne et nouvelle)
de COLAMA (Comité de langue mambay) y compris Kam Kaagbungni et Moussa Tao,
et avec ses membres, en particulier Oussoumanou Bouba, Kwe Nathaniel, Koué Agabus,
Bégui Démas et Bouba Robert. J’ai apprécié aussi l’aide de Tao Justin et de Peevina
Salomon dans l’apprentissage de la langue.
Nos voisins à Kaakaala et à Figuil étaient pour nous un support et une grande joie : Saadu
Kami Taw, Younoussa Wouri, Kada Kaakaala, Amina Beezwa’ et sa famille, Adoum
Kami, Barnabas et Tigam Kaakaala, Parna paaru Samson, Napuga, Haman Kaakaala,
Njidda Robert, et les grands parmi les Mambay qui se rassemblèrent saa napuga chez
Kami Koué. En plus, nous étions à l’aise parmi nos frères de l’église à Kaakaala et avec
leur catéchiste.
Je remercie aussi ceux que nous connaissions hors du pays mambay. À N’Djaména, nous
avons eu le plaisir de connaître Oumarou Beïki, Abassi Moustapha, Mohamadou
Maouarmi et tous les membres du Comité des Ressortissants du Canton de Beepahna
(Biparé). À Maroua, Issa Haman et Souahibou Kassala m’ont orienté avec justesse.
C’est à Oussoumanou Bouba que je réserve un remerciement tout particulier. Il est
quelqu’un qui vit selon le proverbe, « Ku’l za’ ah paa bin, muu zyagri i am » ‘Si tu
apprends la danse du pied d’un autre, tu tromperas le tien.’ Cette individualité, ferme et
parfois rigide, lui a permis pourtant de se donner sans vacillation à la promotion de sa
langue pour l’honneur de ses parents et pour l’héritage des ses enfants et de son peuple.
Nous avons connu ensemble une collaboration enrichissante, et j’espère donc que j’ai pu,
en revanche, l’aider à réaliser ses propres aspirations. En ce qui concerne notre
cheminement divergeant, je lui affirme qu’il n’y aura pas un autre comme lui, puisqueiii« Heega hii haa saa fi naale ya » ‘Un couteau ne peut pas rentrer dans le fourreau de
son collègue.’
Finalement, je dis au peuple mambay, ri zoori ro! Nous vous saluons! Kiswa! Nous
vous remercions! Comme « Tuh bom hii marva ya » ‘Un seul bracelet ne fait aucun
bruit,’ que vous vous épanouissiez dans un esprit d’entente mutuelle. La’ fah kaa fuu
peh bee naa sigzi Kaakaala ma Lahzwa’, ró haan iro kinabom. Ná liizi ka ná
%aazi ig para. Siketi má gbah sehzinza, má gii zimfin anza. Má pale la’ ido’.ivContentsAcknowledgments............................................................................................................... ii

"8.4.1 Distribution of adjectives
Adjectives are used in two positions: first, in the dependent position of a noun phrase
(5.14.2); and secondly, as an attributive predicate (10.1.3.3). In this section, both
possibilities are compared with nouns found in an equivalent position. They are also
compared with adverbs which, although they are structurally similar to adjectives, have a
distinct syntactic distribution.
Adjectives are syntactically distinct from nouns, which are also used to express noun
attributes. It is true that in noun phrases, it is not possible to distinguish nouns and
adjectives syntactically (5.14.1, 5.14.2):
noun + adjective:bàh
míz4míz
rain:LF drizzlydrizzly rainnoun + noun:bàh
pâh
rain:LF wetnesswet rainHowever, the difference between adjectives and nouns may be deduced from attributive
predicate constructions: an adjective is juxtaposed with the noun it modifies (10.1.3.3),
but an attributive noun is always connected to the noun it modifies with the copula ká
(10.1.3.2):
adjective:)à
3IMPERSmíz4míz
drizzlynoun:)à
3IMPERSká
ATTRIB391it is drizzly
pâh it is wet
wetnessThe situation is comparable for adjectives and ideophonic adverbs (8.3). Although there
are many structural similarities between these two classes, there are differences in
syntactic distribution. As shown above and repeated in the following examples,
adjectives are found in the dependent position of a noun phrase or in an attributive
predicate.
dependent position:bàh
míz4míz
rain:LF drizzlyattributive predicate: )à
3IMPERSmíz4míz

and can only be followed by a particle (10.1.1).

Following a nominal object, adjectives as well as adverbs may be found. If the postobject item in question is an adjective which describes the object, the object displays
linked noun morphology (5.2.2).
tìgín
nâ’
drop:PFV sauce:LFlùr ùg
stickyhe/she/it dropped the sticky sauce
However, if the item is an adverb, the object lacks this morphology since the adverb
modifies the verb or clause rather than the object.
tìgín
ná’rà
drop:PFV saucekpíh
IDEOhe/she/it dropped the sauce with a clunk
This morphology usually serves to identify the word class of the post-object word, even
when the word in question is an ideophone showing flexibility between adjectival and
adverbial class membership (8.5.6).

However, in cases where the object noun is of a structure whose linked form is identical
to its free (unmarked) form (5.2.2), the distinctiveness of the flexible ideophone as
adjective vs. adverb is neutralized.

In the following subsections, the structure of adjectives is outlined. First, the distinction
between adjective stem and morphologically complex adjective stem is examined in
reference to the structural repetition which is common among adjectives (8.4.2.1).
Adjectival structure is then presented in terms of allowable CV shapes (8.4.2.2) and tonal
melodies (8.4.2.3).
8.4.2.1 Structural repetition
Structural repetition is a pervasive feature of adjectives in Mambay, where it has been
observed only in adjectives with more than one syllable. It is evident in repetition of
segments (8.4.2.1.1) as well as partial and full reduplication (8.4.2.1.2). A review of
these phenomena shows that while co-occurrence patterns and partial reduplication must
be considered inherent to the adjectival root, full reduplication is the result of a
morphological template associated with the root (8.4.2.1.2), even when no derivation may
be identified. Consequently, in the discussion on adjective structure, monomorphemic
adjective stems will be considered separately from morphologically complex adjective
stems.
8.4.2.1.1 Repetition of segments
Repeated segments are found in almost every adjective with more than one syllable. In
the data, for example, vowels within an adjective are overwhelmingly identical.
óró
kpírfí
làr àg
yérkété7deep, far away
low
flat-nosed
round393Formally, the limitation of adjectives to a single vowel place quality is slightly less strict
(since vowels in the adjective may still be unevenly subject to modifications such as
length and pharyngealization). However, it is found with extreme regularity.

shallowIn addition to a consistent vowel place quality, coda consonants within an adjective are
usually identical. The overlapping of these two tendencies means that entire syllable
rhymes are, more often than not, repeated. This could alternatively be viewed as
variation of the onset with a constant rhyme.

Additionally, the composition of three-syllable adjectives in particular reveals repetition
of entire syllables; this brings to mind reduplication of a greater scope than simple
repetition. In most examples of three-syllable adjectives, the final two syllables are
identical.
rùgùgù
vbàhtátá
wágágáslow
strong and healthy
healthy, cool(but cf. kpìmsìrì ‘thick, fat’)
And for typical two-syllable adjectives—including those for which a derivation (8.5) is
not identifiable—it appears that full reduplication has applied, resulting in adjective
stems composed of a single repeated syllable.
kpó’4kpó’
lòr4lòr
pyúú4pyúúdry

pointed, sharp
394Several derivational processes (8.5) are available to provide evidence as to whether or not
such words are morphologically complex stems derived from a monosyllabic root. One
derivation in particular, that of ideophonic emphasis (8.5.2), is used here to explore this
question. The intensified forms of the two-syllable CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV adjectives
are as follows:
kpí4kpó’
lì4lòr
pí4pyúúvery dry
very shiny with baldness
very pointed, very sharpIn these forms, only one of the two syllables is used as a source for the derivation.
However, when three-syllable adjectives undergo the same derivation, all segmental
information is preserved:slow

healthy, coolbase formemphatic form (‘very …’)rùgùgù
vbàhtátá
wágágáríì4rúgúgú
vbíì4vbáhtátá
wíì4wágágáFurther specifications are needed to accurately delineate these patterns. First, the twosyllable adjective à à ‘shy,’ which is of an uncommon CV.CV shape, is exceptional in
that its emphatic form íì4 á á does not pattern with the typical two-syllable adjectives
above, but with other adjectives, whose segmental information is copied in its entirety.
Second, the single attested four-syllable adjective kírí4kìrì ‘spherical’ does not have a
derived emphatic form; this makes the determination of its morphological composition
problematic. However, since adjectives and ideophonic adverbs undergo some of the
same derivational processes, it is possible to argue that the derivation of an ideophonic
adverb of the same shape (see 8.5.4.2 in particular) provides evidence for a
morphological complexity similar to that of typical two-syllable adjectives.
tégú4tègù
tégú tègù tégúwith head and chin sticking out
back and forth, with head and chin sticking outIn sum, the data presented here suggest that typical two-syllable adjective stems with
identical reduplicated syllables (CVC.CVC and CVV.CVV) are morphologically
complex. In contrast, other stems in which the last two syllables are identical appear to
be morphologically simple stems whose repetition is a function of their ideophonic
identity rather than a morphological process.
8.4.2.2 Allowable CV shapes
Based on the principles outlined in section (8.4.2.1.2) above, allowable shapes for
adjectives are divided into those that consist of morphologically simple stems (8.4.2.2.1),
and those that occur as morphologically complex stems (8.4.2.2.2).","[408, 409, 410, 411, 412]"
"7.6.3 Complex inflectional constructions
There are two kinds of complex inflectional constructions: serial verb constructions
(7.6.3.1) and verbal constructions formed by means of auxiliaries (7.6.3.2).
7.6.3.1 Serial verb constructions
Two types of serial verb constructions are commonly attested in Mambay: these have
been labelled Realis Future 2 and Imperfective Progressive 2.
Realis Future 2
In Realis Future 2 constructions, two finite verbs are found together, and there is no
independent person marking on the second finite verb (as per the typical serial verb
constructions described in Payne 1997:308).
Structure: various forms of vè ‘go’ + Perfective verb word
mì
1SGvè
go:PFVtè’
walk:PFVI was going to walknà
1&2vè4zí
go:PFV-PLtè’
walk:PFVwe (incl.) were going to walkImperfective Progressive 2
Structure: optional Realis pronoun + tògó ‘be’ (7.3.3.3) + Imperfective
ex. (mì) toFg mì té’là
1SG be 1SG walk:VNI am walking / I am in the
process of walkingThe optional nature of the subject pronoun with tògó ‘be’ shows that two discrete types
of constructions are used to express the Imperfective Progressive 2. When tògó is found
with its own subject pronoun, the Imperfective Progressive 2 is a serial verb construction.
Evidence for its identity as a serial verb construction rather than an instance of juxtaposed
clauses comes from two directions: first, the subject of both tògó ‘be’ (when it is used)
and the subject of the following Imperfective verb form must be identical; and second,369tògó appears in the Imperfective Progressive 2 as toFg, which is its phrase-internal
realization (cf. its phrase-final realization; see 7.3.3.3; also cf. Payne 1997:308–9).
The optional nature of the subject pronoun with tògó ‘be’ suggests that tògó is in the
process of being grammaticalized as a TAM adverb (7.6.1.2) with progressive meaning.
7.6.3.2 Constructions with auxiliaries
A variety of complex inflectional constructions employ auxiliaries, that is, verbs which
are head of the verb phrase but which do not embody the main activity expressed by the
clause (Payne 1997:84). In addition, the examples below show that auxiliaries express a
meaning that is not fully compositional, that is, one which differs from the meaning
found when the same verb does embody a clause’s main activity.
When an auxiliary is used in Mambay, the main activity or state is expressed as an object
or adverbial complement of the auxiliary. Formally, there are two major types of
constructions with auxiliaries: those followed by verbal nouns (7.6.3.2.1), and those
followed by subordinate clauses (7.6.3.2.2).
7.6.3.2.1 Auxiliaries followed by verbal nouns
Most auxiliaries are followed by verbal nouns, which express the central event or state of
a clause. This given, there are three positions in which the verbal noun accompanying an
auxiliary may be found:
1. on its own;
mì
1SG%áá
find:PFVté’là
walk:VNI was able to walk2. prefixed with kì4 ‘place, time, situation’ (5.1.2.4.5);
mì
1SG)èr
get.up:PFVkì4té’là
place:PFX-walk:VNI was just walking3. as a complement of a preposition (cf. 9.3)
mì
1SGtìì
become:PFVmá
withté’là
walk:VNI walk (habitually) /
I walked (habitually)As is evident from the first and second examples here, the distribution of a verbal noun
vs. a verbal noun prefixed with kì4 does not appear to be semantically significant.
However, in most cases a given auxiliary is syntactically limited to one of the two
strategies; the reasons for the choice of one form over another are not clear. Both are
found with intransitive as well as intransitive verbs, so based on transitivity requirements
established elsewhere in the language (7.3.2.1), verbal nouns (with or without kì4) must
be viewed variously as adverbial complements (with intransitive auxiliaries) or objects
(with transitive auxiliaries).
370The inflectional categories expressed by constructions have been organized according to
form and labelled according to their function as follows:
- Habitual
- Potential
- Realis Future 3
- Recent Past
- Past-Imperfective 1
- Future-Imperfective 1
- Past-Imperfective 2
- Future-Imperfective 2
The structure and function of these forms is described below, and a chart summarizing
the structure of all the forms is found at the end of this section.

Indicative verbs (7.5) are expressed using Irrealis pronouns (this grouping is defended in
7.4.1.2). All other Indicative verb forms fall under the domain of Realis.
Among Realis verb forms, a distinction is made between Perfective (7.4.1.1.1) and
Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2) aspects. Perfective forms communicate events which have been
completed in reference to a given point in time, and Imperfective forms refer to events
which happen but which have not been completed in reference to a given point in time.
Perfective forms are represented by three distinct tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect and
Pluperfect), but there is only one basic Imperfective tense. The two aspects differ
formally in several respects. First of all, the segmental shape of the Perfective is the verb
stem, but that of the Imperfective is the verbal noun (5.9). Secondly, while the third
person is invariably marked in the Perfective with a zero pronoun, it is marked in the
Imperfective with a segmental pronoun )à whenever there is no nominal subject
(7.4.1.1.2). Thirdly, the negated form of the Perfective is found with a LH pronoun, but
negated Imperfective forms are found with a HL pronoun (7.5.3).
The Optative and the five Indicative tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect, Pluperfect,
Imperfective and Future) are distinguished from one another by contrastive tone melodies
and by the inventory of verbal suffixes which may found with each (7.3.1). The tone
melodies associated with the possible forms of a given verb fall into six tonal sets or
classes (7.3.2.2). If the tone melody is known for the basic Perfective, Perfect and
Future, melodies for the remaining forms can be predicted. Concerning the inventory of
verbal suffixes, reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) are obligatorily found with Perfect and
Pluperfect forms of intransitive verbs, and optionally found with Future and Optative
forms of intransitive verbs. Further, the Perfect forms of transitive verbs always take the
suffix 4rì, and Imperfective forms of transitive verbs must take the dummy object suffix 4
na if there is no explicit object.
An additional minor verb form, a Realis Future, is found uniquely with the verb vè ‘go’
(7.3.3.1.2). It is composed of an Imperfective pronoun and a Future verb stem.
Each of the basic infectional categories is presented in the sections below (7.4.1–7.4.2).
Negative verb forms are considered separately (7.5). Criteria used for distinguishing verb
forms, all of which have been presented in this section, are summarized in the following

Indicative verb forms, which are used to express events (but see 7.4.1.2.1), are specified
for Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) values. While Realis forms signal events which
have happened or are happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already
happened and which are not happening.
7.4.1.1 Realis
Realis verb forms are divided into two aspects: Perfective (three tenses; 7.4.1.1.1) and
Imperfective (one tense; 7.4.1.1.2). Perfective forms signal events which, in reference to
a given point in time, have already happened. Imperfective forms are used for events
which, in reference to a given point in time, happen but are not completed.
One formal characteristic common to Realis verb forms is a subject pronoun paradigm
with a CV structure (6.1.2). Other formal features vary among the four constituent tenses.
A minor Realis Future verb form, which is found uniquely with the verb vè ‘go,’ is
discussed in 7.3.3.1.
7.4.1.1.1 Perfective
There are three perfective tenses: basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1), Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2), and
Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.3). Perfective verb forms have in common that they are based on
the verb stem, that third person forms are invariably marked with a zero pronoun, and
that negated forms are found with LH pronouns (7.5.3).
7.4.1.1.1.1 Basic Perfective
The basic Perfective tense is used for completed events. In contrast to the Perfect and
Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.2, 7.4.1.1.1.3), it is unspecified regarding the consequences of an
event for a later point in time. The basic Perfective tense is the default means of marking
sequential events in narrative discourse (Anonby 2005:29–32). It is typically structured
as follows:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfective tone)
ex. mì hèè
1SG climb:PFV
rò làà
)ígà
2PL eat:PFV thingI climbed
you (pl.) ate something(Transitive verbs such as làà ‘eat,’ shown in the above example, have object

sections).","[358, 359]"

The basic inflectional categories in Mambay are marked by length and tone on subject
pronouns (6.1.2) and tone on verb words (see 7.3.2.2 as well this section below).
Mambay verb forms may be divided into Indicative (7.4.1) and Optative (7.4.2) moods.
The clear majority of verb forms are Indicative, and are further subdivided according to
realis value, aspect, and tense.8 Optative forms, in contrast, do not reflect these
distinctions. This basic verb system may be schematized as follows:
Functions of basic verbal inflection in Mambay
mood
Indicativerealis value
RealisaspecttensePerfectivePerfective (basic)
Perfect
PluperfectImperfective
IrrealisFutureOptative
Indicative verb forms are used to express events (7.4.1). Optative verb forms, in contrast,
are used to express a speaker’s wishes, to express purpose in dependent clauses, and to
express the effect of causation (7.4.2). Formally, the classification of Indicative vs.
Optative mood corresponds to the use of the negation particles yá and gá (7.5.2)
respectively. In addition, Indicative verb forms are inflected for realis value, aspect, and
tense.
Indicative verb forms are specified for Realis and Irrealis values. In contrast to Optative
forms, which are inherently irrealis and not marked for realis distinction, Indicative
Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) forms are distinguished. Formally, this distinction is
marked on the subject pronoun: Realis pronouns are short (CV), and Irrealis pronouns are
long (CVV) (6.1.2). While Realis forms signal events which have happened or are
happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not
8In the present study, as has been common in the study of Niger-Congo generally, the term “tense” is
understood in a traditional sense: “any one of the different forms or modifications (or word-groups) in the
conjugation of a verb which indicate the different times (past, present, or future) at which the action or
state denoted by it is viewed as happening or existing, and also (by extension) the different nature of such
action or state, as continuing (imperfect) or completed (perfect)” (Oxford English Dictionary online 2007;
cf. Doke 1935:209, Dimmendaal 2000:162 and Crystal 2003:459–60). This differs from the use of the term
in Comrie (1976) and, subsequently, much of the literature (e.g. Lyons 1995:312 ff.), where event sequence
(“tense”) and the internal structure of events (“aspect”) are treated as distinct categories of verb
modification. In Mambay, there is no formal justification for such a distinction.","[355, 356]"
"2596.1.1.2 Impersonal
For third person singular as well as third person plural pronouns, there is a partial default
vs. impersonal contrast. Whereas default third person pronouns make explicit reference
to a discourse participant, impersonal pronouns are used when a participant is not in view
(i.e., is backgrounded or irrelevant) but the grammatical context still requires a pronoun.
The default vs. impersonal distinction is formalized only for independent pronouns
(6.1.2.1) used as subjects of verbless attributive clauses (cf. 8.4.1) and for possessive
pronouns (6.1.4).
An illustration of this distinction in verbless clauses is as follows:

afterward (cf. 5.13)6.1.1.3 Generic
A marginal generic third person category in Mambay is expressed using the third person
generic pronoun duFg ‘one, they, people.’ This pronoun differs from all other twelve
pronominal person slots in that it is not found with its own distinctive pronoun forms
(i.e., subject, object and possessive); instead, it patterns syntactically like a subject noun
or an emphatic subject pronoun (6.1.5.1), since it is found as the subject in clauses which
are already accompanied by a third person (singular or plural) pronoun. In the following
examples, the generic third person pronoun duFg is compared with the formally similar
emphatic forms of the third person singular and plural:

they, people’), it is never found with Perfective verb forms, which signal events that have
taken place in conjunction with specific subjects (6.1.2.2).

6.1.1.4 Co-reference
In addition to the person-related pronominal categories already catalogued in this section,
Mambay makes use of a system of co-reference with third person pronouns. This system,
which helps users of the language to keep track third person referents, has been described
in Anonby (2005:27–44). In the present section, generalities of co-reference in Mambay
are laid out.
Co-reference pronouns are used to show that a real-world referent is the same as one
which has been previously designated. In contrast to anaphoric demonstratives (9.2.2),
which are used to refer back over longer distances of text, co-reference functions within a
clause.
Although they comprise a single formal set in Mambay, co-reference pronouns are used
in two capacities: reflexive and logophoric (cf. Wiesemann 1986:438, Kutsch Lojenga
2007:143–5). Reflexive co-reference pronouns are used within a simple clause to refer
back to the subject of the clause. They are represented by reflexive object pronouns
(6.1.3.2) and possessive pronouns (6.1.4).

3:PFV forget:PFV name:LF)úùrú
3SG.POSShe/she/iti forgot his/her/itsj nameFor their part, logophoric co-reference pronouns in Mambay show that a participant in an
Indicative complement clause refers to the same participant as the subject of the main
clause (cf. Watters 2000:225). Specifically, it is main-clause verbs of “speech, thoughts,
feelings, or general state of consciousness” followed by the complementizer bè (10.2.2.1)
which trigger the use of logophoric pronouns in the complement clause (Clements
1975:141, cf. Hagège 1974:290). When default (non co-reference) pronouns are used in
this context, it signals a switch in pronominal reference. A pair of examples contrasting
the use of logophoric co-reference pronouns with default pronouns is as follows:
logophoric co-reference pronoun:
Ø

Unlike third person subject pronouns found in Indicative complement clauses, which
exhibit a logophoric/default contrast, those found in Optative complement clauses are
invariable.

Because the domain of logophoric co-reference is within a single main clause (including
embedded complement clauses), referentially identical subjects in juxtaposed main
clauses are marked with a default pronoun.

6.1.1.5 Formal redundancy between categories
Of the thirteen pronominal person slots, five do not share forms with other slots: 1SG,
2SG, 3GEN, 1PL and 2PL. First-and-second person (6.1.1.5.1) and most third person263(6.1.1.5.2) pronouns, in contrast, exhibit partial formal redundancy with other pronouns
in the same group.
6.1.1.5.1 First-and-second (1&2) person pronouns
The distinction between first-and-second person singular vs. plural (6.1.1.1) is absent on
(non-emphatic) verbal subject pronouns (6.1.2). Instead, it is formalized on verbs
through the use of the plurality affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes
(7.3.1.2) with verb stems.

person pronoun forms (6.1.1.1).
6.1.1.5.2 Third person pronouns
There are two sets of third person pronouns which exhibit partial formal redundancy:
third person singular with third person plural, and third person (sg./pl.) with third person
impersonal (sg./pl.).
Similarly to what happens with first-and-second person pronouns (6.1.1.5.1), a distinction
of plurality is not marked on (non-logophoric) third person verbal subject pronouns;
rather, it is formalized through the use of the inflectional plurality affix 4zí (7.3.1.1)
and/or the third person singular and plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verbs.

(For a discussion of the function of these affixes in plural Future forms, see 7.3.1.2 and

The distinction between default and impersonal third person pronouns is formalized only
for independent pronouns and possessive pronouns (6.1.2.1, 6.1.1.2).

There are seven sets of subject pronouns:
- independent (6.1.2.1);
- Perfective (6.1.2.2);
- Imperfective (6.1.2.3);
- affirmative Indicative Irrealis (Future) (6.1.2.4);
- negative Perfective (6.1.2.6);
- negative non-Perfective (6.1.2.6); and
- Optative (6.1.2.7).
As this list shows, formal diversity among subject pronouns is largely a reflection of
mood, realis value and aspect marking (cf. Wiesemann 1986:x, Burquest 1986:73–80).
Distinctions are conveyed by means of contrastive vowel length, tone, and the patterning
of third person pronouns.
The structure of first and second person subject pronouns is regular. Pronoun forms
which pattern together for the first and second person are 1) Indicative Realis, 2)
Indicative Irrealis and 3) Optative.
1. Indicative Realis pronouns represent independent pronouns, Perfective
tenses and the Imperfective, and exhibit a common CV structure.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

compound nouns. While most of the names are semantically opaque, the meaning and/or
source of some of them may be determined.
Rather than plurals, the collective prefix tì4 (5.6.1) is used with clan names.

As is the case for prepositions (9.3), nouns may be used to indicate location (for formal
differences between the two word classes, see 9.3.3). Like objects of transitive verbs
(7.3.2.1.2), nouns functioning locatively are morphologically unmarked complements
which follow a verb.
Ø yàà fíílò
3:PFV stay:PFV house
cf. Ø kó fíílò
3:PFV see:PFV househe/she/it stayed at the house
he/she/it saw the house250Importantly, and similar to what is found in Mundang and some related languages (Elders
2000:253–4, Welmers 1973:216–7; cf. Ruelland 1992:230–1), there is no formal
difference between the two following a transitive verb. This may lead to ambiguity
which is only resolved in the referential realm, as the following example shows:
Ø làà4rì túrà
3:PFV eat:PERF-PERF millethe/she/it has eaten millet / he/she/it has eaten
at the millet (i.e., among the millet plants)When an object and locational complement are found in the same clause, the object
comes first.
Ø làà túrà )áà
3:PFV eat:PFV millet beanshe/she/it has eaten millet among the bean plantsØ làà )áà túrà
3:PFV eat:PFV beans millethe/she/it has eaten beans among the millet plantsAlthough a wide range of nouns could be used in a locative function, three categories in
particular are commonly used: locations in the referential realm, inherently locative
nouns, and body parts used in a locative capacity.
Examples of locations in the referential realm (see also 5.12.3) are as follows:

5.3.3.3.1). The possessor may be a noun or an inalienable possessive pronoun (cf.
5.3.4.2.2).

Noun phrases are constructions involving a head noun and, potentially, additional
elements. Like clauses (10.1.1) and prepositional phrases (9.3), noun phrases are leftheaded in Mambay. The following noun phrase constructions are used commonly:
noun + noun (including possessive pronouns and noun phrases)
noun + adjective
noun + numeral
noun + specifier
noun + prepositional phrase
noun + relative clause

10.2.2.3 Relative clauses
Relative clauses, which function as noun modifiers, are uniformly postnominal: they
follow the linked form (5.2.2) of the noun they modify and the invariable relativizer nàá
(cf. 5.14.6).

Relative clauses in Mambay are versatile: there appear to be few restrictions on the
distribution of TAM in relative clauses, and the antecedent nouns they accompany may
function as their subjects, objects or locative/temporal complements.
First of all, subject relative clauses—those for which the antecedent noun is the subject of
the relative clause—are common (relative clauses are shown in square brackets).

Almost all verbs may take extensions; the only exceptions which have been identified are
the irregular verbs vè ‘go,’ húm ‘come’ and tògó ‘be’ (7.3.3).
The existence of verbal extensions in the first place is suggested by recurrent sets of
verbs with similarities in both meaning and segmental structure. In most cases, a source
verb root may be identified for verbs stems containing extensions.

cause to emergeIn other cases, it appears that although there is no identifiable source verb, the extensions
associated with the stems may be substituted.
For example, while there is no
synchronically attested verb káá, three stems appear to be related to this hypothetical
root:
kàn
kànní
kàrpass, exceed, abuse
overtake, overdo, cause to pass
put, setOccasionally, neither a source verb nor a pattern of substitution is evident. In such cases,
the contribution of a verbal extension is suggested based on the verb stem’s conformity to
the tonal patterns (Classes 5 and 6) associated with more typical extended verbs, which
are obviously derived. Also, when possible, a stem’s intimation of the semantic
contribution of a particular verbal extension is considered (7.2.3, 7.2.4).

Irregular verbal nouns correspond to intransitive verbs stems. In addition to their
intransitivity (cf. 7.3.2.1), they differ from regular verbal nouns (5.9.1.1) in their
derivational behaviour.
Importantly, there is no synchronic process by which irregular verbal nouns are derived
from verb stems. Historically, irregular verbal nouns appear to have undergone a
historical wave of unevenly applied derivational suffixation along with the rest of the
nouns in the language (5.1.3.2; this has been further described in Anonby 2008). This

show segmental and semantic correspondences to specific verb stems. However, in other
respects they are like nouns in general. Over one hundred fossilized verbal nouns have
been identified in the data; this is out of a total of 1525 non-borrowed, lexicalized nouns.
Fossilized verbal nouns correspond to transitive as well as intransitive verbs.

pullFossilized verbal nouns are like irregular true verbal nouns (5.9.1.2) in that there is no
synchronic process by which they are derived from verb stems.
However, they differ from true verbal nouns (regular and irregular) in three important
ways. First, fossilized verbal nouns cannot participate in verbal constructions, notably
those involving Imperfective verb forms (cf. 7.4.1.1.2); second, although they exhibit
more structural complexity than true verbal nouns, transitivity does not influence their
structure; and third, they are semantically unpredictable.
In the subsections that follow, the morphological structure and semantic values of
fossilized verbal nouns are described (5.9.2.1 and 5.9.2.2). Following this, the direction
of historical noun/verb derivation is considered (5.9.2.3).
5.9.2.1 Morphological structure
The structures of fossilized verbal nouns are a significant subset of those found with
nouns in general (5.1). The inventory of CV shapes of fossilized verbal nouns in the data
is as follows:234CV shapeverbal nounCVV

undergone a historical wave of unevenly applied derivational suffixation (Anonby 2008,
5.1.3.2; but see 5.9.2.3). However, the structure of fossilized verbal nouns is more
varied. For example, while irregular true verbal nouns contain a maximum of two
syllables (5.9.1.2), there are many fossilized verbal nouns with three-syllable stems.
Also, in addition to historically fused suffixes (5.1.3.2), there are also two semantically
salient suffixes found principally with fossilized verbal nouns: 4(g)VrV and 4zi. 4(g)VrV
is a fused generic suffix found with nouns historically derived from intransitive verbs,
and is described in 5.1.3.2. Examples of this suffix are:
fìmgórò

heatThe suffix 4zi, which is formally reminiscent of the noun plural template (5.5.2.1), verbal
plural person affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and the verbal extension 4zi (7.2.4.4), appears to have a
pluractional meaning when it is found in the context of fossilized verbal nouns. With a
single exception (lóózìrá ‘tiredness, difficulty’; see list below), it is found only in
fossilized verbal nouns derived from transitive verbs.

contain obligatory prefixes (see 5.1.2 for a discussion of noun prefixes). These prefixes
are not attested with irregular true verbal nouns (5.9.1.2). The prefix nà4 is quite
common with fossilized verbal nouns, and all fossilized verbal nouns with this prefix are
derived from transitive verbs. The single example of a verbal noun with the prefix tì4 is,
in contrast, derived from an intransitive verb.

In contrast to true verbal nouns (5.9.1), fossilized verbal nouns are semantically
unpredictable. True verbal nouns minimally refer to a verbal action or state which is
brought about by the subject (whether agent or patient), and this is the case for some
fossilized verbal nouns.

It is often difficult to establish the direction of historical derivation between fossilized
verbal nouns and corresponding verb stems. In contrast to what happens with regular
verbal nouns, whose derivation from verb stems is marked by the possibility of
suffixation with the dummy object suffix 4na (5.9.1.1), there is no productive synchronic
affixation on fossilized verbal nouns. Rather, as demonstrated by the previous sections
(5.9.2.1, 5.9.2.2), the morphological structure and semantic value of fossilized verbal
nouns is varied, and does not correspond systematically with related verb roots.
Obviously, there are two historical derivational possibilities for each pair: verb-to-noun,
and noun-to-verb. On the one hand, it is technically possible that noun-to-verb derivation
has taken place, and that verbs have been historically derived from corresponding nouns
by means of CVC(CV) morphological templates.

Synchronically, however, verbs which are demonstrably derived from nouns or any other
part of speech are disyllabic and always have LH tone in their basic Perfective form
(7.4.1.1.1.1).

fossilized verbal nouns reflect a historical noun-to-verb derivation (or, at least, one that
functioned in the same way as the synchronic noun-to-verb derivation).
On the other hand, there are a couple of modest indicators of historical verb-to-noun
derivation. One indicator is, with one exception, the limitation of fossilized verbal noun
prefixes to nà4 (5.9.2.1 above). This is very different from nouns in general, with which
any of ten different prefixes may constitute an obligatory component (5.1.2.1). If many or
most corresponding verbs were derived from nouns, a range of prefixes would likely be
represented.
A second indicator of historical verb-to-noun derivation is the repeated occurrence of
more than one noun corresponding to a single verb.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]"
"When used with the conjunction kóó ‘-ever, even if’ and the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1), interrogative pronouns become non-interrogative but still exhibit an ‘-ever’
type of indefiniteness (cf. Welmers 1973:435).

VERBS
7VERBSThe Mambay verb system exhibits richness in the types of available verb structures as
well as the functional distinctions represented by combinations of these structures. These
possibilities are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The first major section of this chapter (7.1) introduces verb stems. While some are
canonical and morphologically simple, others are non-canonical and, in some cases,
morphologically complex. Non-canonical verbs result from the application of verbal
extensions, derivation of verbs from other parts of speech, the ideophonic nature of some
verbs, and borrowing of verbs from other languages.
The set of verbal extensions is the most significant way in which verb stems are
composed, and is investigated in detail in 7.2. This set is reminiscent of systems found
elsewhere in Niger-Congo. While some extensions found in Mambay are synchronically
productive, others are not; also, the semantic transparency of verbal extensions varies.
The subsequent section (7.3) examines verb word morphology. Segmental affixes are
dealt with in detail, and the behaviour of tone in verb words is examined. In addition,
verbs are classified with respect to transitivity and tone melody. Irregular verbs are also
considered.
Verbal inflection is explored in 7.4. Specifically, this section treats basic inflectional
categories, which are marked length on subject pronouns and tone on subject pronouns
and verb words. It is shown that a division between Indicative and Optative mood is
fundamental to the verb system, and Indicative verb forms are also distinguished for
realis value and aspect. Negative verb forms, which pattern differently than their
affirmative counterparts, are treated separately in 7.5.
The expansion of verbal inflection by means of TAM indicators, possessive constructions
and complex inflectional constructions (specifically, serial and auxiliary verbs) forms the
substance of the discussion in 7.6. A final section (7.7) discusses composite verbal
expressions and their contribution to the verb lexicon.
Unless it has been otherwise specified, example verbs are given in their basic Perfective
forms (cf. 7.4.1.1.1.1).","[314, 315, 316]"

illustrative pairs for tonal contrasts with the single HLHL morpheme in the data; the
existence of HLHL as a distinct tone melody has instead been established with reference
to principles of tone association (4.1.2.1) in order to account for the idiosyncratic
phonetic form of the HLHL example in the data (4.1.2.6).
4.1.2.6 Examples of tone melodies associated with attested CV shapes
Each of the seven attested tone melodies is shown here with all of the CV shapes with
which it is found in the morphologically simple data.
Where postlexical processes (4.3) cause the tone melody of a morpheme to be realized
differently than might be inferred from the orthographic representation of its underlying
form (see the introduction to this chapter), underlying forms as well as surface
realizations are provided.
The exclusion of lexical prefixes from the CV shape and from the tone melody of nouns
is discussed in 4.1.2.3 and 5.1.2.2.

"5.12.1.1 Canonical names
There are exactly ten Mambay canonical personal names (nà4wâgrá) in common usage.
Four of the names are for males, and six are for females. Birth order, parent’s nà4wâgrá,
and a child’s temperament are factors which play into the choice of the name. This name
also emphasizes a person’s membership in the ethnic group. The four canonical personal
names for males are:

pàná
nàgáAll of the canonical names contain two morae: either two light syllables or one heavy
syllable. While male canonical names exhibit four tone melodies (H, L, HL, LH), all of
the female canonical names are LH.
For married women, the augmentative/female prefix tí4 (5.8.2) is normally used with the
name as a means of conveying respect:

Situational names are given as a way of marking the circumstances surrounding a child’s
birth: for example, they may be used to respond to a lie or an insult, to complain, or to
show thankfulness. Most such names are unique to individuals, and they are formed in
the same way for males and females. One situational name comprised of a noun has been
attested (nà4kàrá ‘cane, guide’), but most names are comprised of a complete clause.

Almost all Mambay now claim adherence to either Islam or Christianity (1.1.3.4), and
this is reflected in the normative use of religious names. The Mambay associate Fulfulde
with Islam, and French with Christianity; consequently, it is from these two languages
that religious names are selected and applied along the religious lines within the ethnic
group. Interestingly, religious names tend to conform to the CV and tonal norms of the
Mambay canonical names (cf. 5.12.1.1): those names that are more than two syllables
often have short (two-mora) forms, and short names are pronounced with LH tone.","[264, 265]"

Adverbial functions, including those which are locational, are not restricted to
prepositions. In fact, nouns and directional adverbs are more commonly used to express428location (together with direction) than are prepositions. In addition, a number of high
frequency verbs express such information.
In Mambay, there are several types of locational nouns (this is described in greater detail
in 5.13). Most locational nouns pattern like prepositions in that they require a dependent
element to follow when they are used locatively (otherwise, they may stand alone). For
locational nouns, however, the dependent element is a possessor noun or possessive
pronoun rather than a complement (9.3.1).

eye/in.presence:LF sunin the sun (cf. nínù ‘eye, face, life’)nílé
in his/her/its (coref.) presence / in its presence
eye/in.presence:3COREF/IMPERS.POSS.INAL
The locational sense is an extension of the central meaning of a noun (usually a body
part), and there is no structural contrast between the two senses (5.13). There are, in
contrast, no non-locational nouns corresponding to true prepositions. As Hagège
(1975:155–6) points out in the context of the Kebi-Benue languages, these differences are
sufficient to treat locational nouns and prepositions as belonging to separate grammatical
classes.
Remaining locational nouns (5.13) are not derived from corresponding non-locative
nouns but fail to conform to the distributional criteria for prepositions in at least one of
two ways. First, like the locational nouns above, some have discrete linked forms (5.2.2)
and/or may be found with possessor nouns (5.3.2) and possessive pronouns (6.1.4) rather
than complements (as shown in 9.3.1 above).

without any following dependent element. Examples of such nouns are:
fà4gbàh7
kaF’
kuFF’
là íoutside
here (i.e., this place)
there (i.e., that place)
left side429Locational nouns also show minor structural differences from prepositions. For one
thing, a noun’s minimal shape is a heavy syllable (5.1.1.1) rather than a light syllable (cf.
9.3), and may exceed one syllable (5.1.1.1). Also, attested tone melodies of prepositions
are more often than not H or L, unlike the usual HL or LH melody of canonical nouns
(5.1.1.2).
Like prepositions, directional adverbs (8.1.1) are also used to express locative concepts.
However, they differ from prepositions in that they may not themselves take a
complement (cf. 9.3.1), and in that they are always found with a verb.

ten are presented in 9.1.3.3.
9.1.3.1 ‘First’ and ‘last’
The ordinal nouns for ‘first’ and ‘last’ differ from other members of the series.
The ordinal noun dâg tômná ‘first’ is a compound noun made up of the nouns dágà
‘mouth, edge’ and the word tômná, which is used only in this context. It differs from
other ordinal nouns in that it is not derived from its corresponding numeral (in this case,
bóm ‘one’). Additionally, it differs in that it is typically found in a dependent rather than
head position (cf. 5.2).cf.kâg

specific numeral to which it corresponds. In contrast, it is probably derived from the
noun fààlá ‘back, skin, place’ (linked form: fàà; see 5.2.2). However, its membership in
the ordinal noun series is underlined by the fact that it contains the ordinal suffix 4rì.
9.1.3.2 Segmental alternations
In four cases, the derivation of numerals with the ordinal prefix suffix 4rì results in
morphophonological alternation. For two of the numerals ( àtì ‘two’ and bì4gírò ‘six’),
this derivation is multi-faceted and may be represented as follows:
àtì ‘two’bì4gírò1) the vowel of the final syllable of the numeral is
dropped;àt+rìbì4gír+rì2) the alveolar–r sequence is disallowed;à+rìbì4gí+rì3) the final vowel of the numeral root is lengthened to
compensate for this loss.áá+rìbì4gíí+rì‘six’The resulting tone melody on áárì ‘second’ is idiosyncratic; see 9.1.3.
In the other two cases (tàrnágà ‘seven’ and fwàrnágà ‘eight’), the final vowel of the
numeral is dropped and the r in the suffix 4rì assimilates to the numeral’s final g.

In Mambay, there is a small class of specifiers. Three demonstratives and an indefinite
article make up this class. Members of this class are used to situate participants within a
discourse, and have in common a restricted distribution: they are only found at the very
end of a noun phrase (5.14) headed by a linked (5.2.2) noun.

demonstratives (9.2.2), but other combinations are not permitted.","[436, 437, 438, 439]"
"7.2.5 Combinations of verbal extensions

From a semantic as well as phonological point of view, the four verbal extensions 4ri, 4gi,
4r, and 4g (7.2.1) appear to be intimately connected. Consequently, any decision to
distinguish or conflate these extensions needs to be defended.
An initial comparison of verbs with 4ri, 4gi, 4r and 4g reveals an apparent contrast among
the four extensions. In the following set of words, the four verbal extensions are attached
to roots which appear to be phonologically equivalent. While 4ri and 4gi constitute a new
syllable in an extended verb stem (7.2.1), 4r and 4g replace the second timing unit of a
long vowel in the verb root to which they are attached (7.2.1) as follows:
hààrí coil
sààgí deceive, flatter
hàr hurry
tàg
sweep, clean, plundercf. háá come back, go back
cf. sáá tell, trick, finish
cf. háá come back, go back
cf. táá stirHowever, the relationships among the four extensions are more complex than this
apparent contrast suggests. In the following sections, the semantic and distributional
relationships between pairs of similar forms are discussed. There, it is suggested that 4ri
and 4gi are partially complementary, and that while 4ri and 4r are also partially
complementary, 4gi and 4g should be regarded as contrastive. Finally, 4r and 4g
demonstrate clear evidence of contrast.
Partial complementarity of
and
Although contrast is presented immediately above for the verbal extensions 4ri and 4gi,
an examination of their lexical distribution, semantic value and phonological distribution
reveals a surprising degree of complementarity.
Unlike the corresponding extensions 4r and 4g (cf. below), 4ri and 4gi are virtually
lexically complementary in the data; a given verb root may be associated either with -ri
313or with 4gi, but usually not with both. The only exceptions are the following pairs of
stems:
dèNmgí
dèNmrí
cf. dèNmharmonize
comment repeatedly
commentnàNwgí
nàNwrí
cf. nàNwspank repeatedly =
spank repeatedly
spankWhile one substitution makes a difference in meaning, the other does not.
The comparable semantic value of the extensions 4ri and 4gi supports a similar pattern of
complementarity. Both forms signal actions which are repeated or intensified (7.2.3).
Since the two extensions are typically found with complementary sets of verb roots (see
previous paragraph), a direct and representative comparison of their meaning is not
possible. These extensions are variously found on verbs with iterative or intensive
values: on the one hand, verbs with 4ri are about evenly divided between those which
contain iterative and intensive meanings; on the other hand, verbs in which 4gi carries an
iterative meaning are arguably more common than those which are intensive, but not
significantly so.
Finally, there is partial complementarity in the phonological distribution of the two
extensions (7.2.3). It is true that either may be associated with a verb stem ending in a
vowel or a labial consonant. However, in other environments, complementarity is clear:
while on the one hand only 4ri is found with verb roots ending in g, on the other hand
only 4gi is found with roots ending in an alveolar consonant or 7.
Relationships within the extension pairs
/ and
/
Although apparent contrast between 4ri and 4r and between 4gi and 4g is shown above
(7.2.6), the relationship between members of these extension pairs is more complex than
this.
There is an obvious structural similarity between 4ri and 4r and between 4gi and 4g. The
possibility of complementarity is especially plausible in light of i-insertion phenomena
found at morpheme boundaries elsewhere in the language: for example, the causative
extension 4n is realized as 4ni in certain morphological contexts (7.2.3.1; for other similar
examples, see 5.2.2, 7.1.2.1, 7.1.2.2 and 7.4.2.1). A further indicator of complementarity
is that whenever these extensions are one of two associated with the same root, 4r or 4g is
always placed first, while 4ri or 4gi is invariably placed second (7.2.5).
This evident complementarity is disrupted by the semantic values associated with each
form (7.2.3–7.2.4). On the one hand, 4gi and 4g are semantically distinct: whereas 4gi
bears an iterative or intensive value, 4g is bears an extensive value and is clearly neither
314iterative nor intensive. On the other hand, a semantic distinction is more difficult to draw
between 4ri and 4r. Like 4gi, 4ri carries an iterative or intensive value. However, 4r
shares only the intensive value of 4ri and is never iterative.
Based on these semantic considerations, and despite the partial phonological and
morphological complementarity that is evident, it is necessary to posit contrast between 4
ri and 4r and between 4gi and 4g.
Contrast between r and g
The preceding discussion shows that a partial complementarity exists between the
extensions 4ri and 4gi as well as between members of the extension pairs 4ri / 4r and 4gi /
4g. It is therefore reasonable to consider whether the extensions 4r and 4g may also be
partially complementary. However, this is not the case; the distribution of 4r and 4g is
contrastive in some word pairs. Examples which show this are as follows:

cross7.3 Verb word morphology
Verb words, along with subject pronouns (6.1.2, 7.4) and expansions of verb forms (7.6),
are fundamental in furnishing morphological structures which communicate the functions
of verbal inflection in Mambay (7.4). In the present section, affixational possibilities are
catalogued (7.3.1) and the tonal behaviour of the verb word is discussed (7.3.2.2.3).
Elements of verb classification (7.3.2) and are then followed by a description of the
morphology of irregular verbs (7.3.3).","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332]"

ex. mì héérà
1SG climb:VNI climb / I am climbingrò héérà

must accompany the noun (7.3.2.1).
mì làá4nà
1SG eat:VN-OBJI eat (something) / I am eating (something)mì làà
1SG eat:VNI eat something / I am eating something)ígà
thingThe verbal plural affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) is used with verbal nouns in Imperfective
conjugations. With intransitive verbs, it attaches following the first syllable of the verbal
noun. For monosyllabic verbal nouns, this is straightforward.
mì Qáà
1SG move.away:VNI move away / I am moving awaynà Qáà4zí
we (incl.) move away / we (incl.) are moving away
1&2 move.away:VN-PL
With disyllabic verbal nouns, morphophonological alternations are complex. If the
verbal noun has two light syllables and the vowel of the first syllable is an exact echo of
the second syllable’s vowel (i.e., V1=V2), the second vowel is deleted when 4zí is added.
mì vágà
1SG go:VNI go / I am goingnà vâg4zí
1&2 go:VN-PLwe (incl.) go / we (incl.) are goingOtherwise, the second syllable is maintained, and 4zí precedes it.
mì héérà
1SG climb:VNI climb / I am climbingnà héé4zí4rà
1&2 climb:VN-PL-VNwe (incl.) climb / we (incl.) are climbing (cf. héérà ‘climbing’)347The affixation of 4zí to some disyllabic nouns is accompanied by irregular morphological
alternations—even suppletion. For example, the final syllable of a two-syllable irregular
verbal noun changes to 4rV if the original suffix is 4gV. (This alternation corresponds
the domain of vestigial noun suffixes, which are otherwise opaque. Note also that
historically, the value of the final vowel has often assimilated partially to the stem; see
5.1.3.2 and Anonby 2007b:REF).

lengthening.

The tone of Imperfective forms of intransitive verbs is lexically determined and
unpredictable, because it is the same as that of the irregular verbal noun used in an
Imperfective function (5.9.1.2). Most commonly, it is HL (for Imperfective forms
corresponding to intransitive stems in any tone class; see 5.9.1.2). For transitive verbs,
the tone melody of the verbal noun is uniform within a given tonal class (5.9.1.1).
Examples of Imperfective forms from each of the six tonal classes (separated here for
transitivity) are as follows:349tonal class, v. word tone

Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negative forms of the
Imperfective, which are marked with a HL pronoun, are discussed in 7.5.
An example from the data which shows that an Imperfective may be anchored to past
events in a story line is as follows:

7.4.1.2 Irrealis
Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not happening.
They have in common a CVV subject pronoun shape. Irrealis verb forms are represented
by the Future tense and negated Indicative verb forms. Although this higher-level
grouping could seem like an ad hoc device to account for a coincidental formal match,
Payne (1997:244–5) and Palmer (2001:168–75) state that both future and negative forms
frequently pattern as irrealis in languages that mark this distinction; Roberts (1990) gives
examples of this (see especially p. 378).
While the Future tense is presented in this section, negated Indicative verb forms are
addressed in 7.5.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367]"
"206In addition to the animacy hierarchy, pragmatic factors such as definiteness and
grammatical (subject vs. object, head vs. non-head position) and discourse roles
(including topicalization and definiteness) may condition the use of morphologically
explicit pluralization on nouns; these issues deserve further investigation.","[223, 224]"
"Structure of verb forms with auxiliary verbs followed by verbal nounscomplex verb formPast-Imperfective 27.6.3.2.2 Auxiliaries followed by subordinate clauses
In addition to being followed by verbal nouns (7.6.3.2.1), auxiliaries may be followed by
subordinate clauses. Past and Future 2 constructions are made possible by periphrastic373constructions in which the auxiliary verb %áá ‘find, succeed, have’ is followed by a
subordinate clause (cf. 10.2.2.2).

Composite verbal expressions constitute an important part of the verb lexicon; well over
a third of the verbs in the data (347 out of 948) are composite expressions. In contrast to
verb expansions, which have to do with enrichment of the inflectional system (7.6),
composite verbal expressions may be found as lexical items (Dimmendaal 2000:179). As
with compound nouns (cf. 5.4), composite verbal expressions are primarily distinguished
from spontaneously constructed verb phrases by recurrent usage rather than structure. As
fixed collocations, they tend to express a single verbal concept; and this semantic value is
often idiomatic.
The following structures have been attested for composite verbal expressions:
- verb stem + noun (7.7.1)
- verb stem + prepositional phrase (7.7.2)
- verb stem + directional adverb (7.7.3)
- verb stem + adjective (7.7.4)
- verb stem + ideophonic adverb (7.7.5)
For composite verbal expressions containing transitive verbs and whose additional
element is not a noun, an object or dummy object (7.3.2.1.2) (neither of which are
necessarily lexicalized as part of the composite verbal expression) must also be present.

ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES AND IDEOPHONES
8ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES AND IDEOPHONESThis chapter deals with adverbs and adjectives. Since ideophones comprise a majority of
adverbs as well as adjectives, they are also treated here as a parallel topic with major
implications for both of these word classes. The first major section (8.1) discusses
adverbs, with a focus on two categories: directional adverbs and TAM
(tense/aspect/mode) adverbs. The subsequent section addresses topics pertaining to
ideophones in general (8.2). The description then focusses on ideophonic adverbs (8.3)
as well as adjectives (8.4), the great majority of which are ideophonic. The final section
treats derivational phenomena associated with ideophones from various word classes
(8.5).","[390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396]"
"3637.6.1.2 TAM adverbs
TAM adverbs constitute an open set, and there is no clear boundary between TAM
adverbs and other adverbs (8.1). In addition to a majority of morphologically simple
adverbs, composed and reduplicated adverbs are attested (e.g. bóm gbúù ‘once more’
and dáhbì dáhbì ‘repeatedly’).
The syntactic distribution of TAM adverbs is heterogeneous: they are found before
subject pronouns, after verb words, in both of these positions and, in one case (%âh ‘go
ahead…’), between the subject pronoun and verb word. However, consistent TAM
functions are associated with each position.
Before subject pronoun
TAM adverbs found before the subject pronoun express modal information; attested
items are as follows:

"Since oral obstruents (with the marginal exception of t and d; see 2.1.2.7) show no
contrast in non morpheme-initial position, they are paired in the lists in this section, and
are written in the phonological orthography using a single symbol, namely that of the
voiced counterpart (see 2.1.3.2 for further explanation).
The absence of velar nasals 7 and N7 in non morpheme-initial onsets parallels their
absence in morpheme-initial onsets (2.1.2.1). The labial-velars kp and gb and the glottal
stop ) are also absent here.
Since other glottalized consonants and semivowels are found here, the absence of Nw
likely reflects its sparse representation in the lexicon rather than a phonological
restriction.
The absence of d in non morpheme-initial onsets may be relegated to a general historical
weakening of d to r in non morpheme-initial position (Boyd 1974:23); alternatively, it
could be viewed as a synchronic neutralization of contrast between members of the pair38d/r. More surprising than the absence of d is the presence of t in this position in seven
words in the data:

kètí
sky, life, above
sí4kètí
God
tí4kúr4kùùtí water plant sp.
vbàhtátá
strong and healthy, solid
wátùtáà
salt, sugar
The presence of t in this position is in contradiction to the distribution of other
obstruents, all of which are voiced; for at least some of the words, this asymmetry may be
due to synchronic or historical morphological complexity.

This contrasts with intransitive stems, with which reflexive suffixes function
inflectionally (7.3.2.1.1). With transitive stems, the reflexive suffixes appease obligatory
object requirements, resulting in valence reduction; in other words, transitive verbs are
detransitivized. Such verbs are inflected like intransitive verbs belonging to the same
tonal class.

In cases where the
detransitivized basic Perfective or Imperfective meaning is intended, the transitive
counterpart is used with a predictable or dummy object.","[344, 345]"
"7.3.1 Affixation
Several types of affixes are found with verb words in Mambay. The most basic affixes,
which are tonal inflection morphemes, are treated in the section on verb classification
(7.3.2), since they fall into a number of lexically determined classes.
All of the other morphemes which are part of verb words are suffixes. Basic inflectional
distinctions are expressed by the verbal plural morpheme 4zí (7.3.1.1), reflexive suffixes
(7.3.1.2) and the Perfect suffix 4rì (7.3.1.3). Other verb suffixes are the dummy object
suffix 4na (7.3.1.4), several object suffixes (7.3.1.5) and the directional suffix 4ìn / 4n` ‘to
here’ (7.3.1.6). Combinatory possibilities of verbal suffixes are listed in 7.3.1.7.",[332]
"7.3.2 Verb classes
Verbs are divided into lexical classes based on two parameters. First, a distinction
between intransitive and transitive verbs is signalled syntactically as well as
morphologically (7.3.2.1). Second, verbs fall into six distinct classes of tonal inflection
(7.3.2.2).
7.3.2.1 Transitivity
There is a basic subdivision of the verb lexicon between two formally distinct classes of
verbs: intransitive (7.3.2.1.1) and transitive (7.3.2.1.2). While the labels “intransitive”
324and “transitive” are helpful in describing the two classes, there are areas of ambiguity
regarding the patterning of transitivity. Because of this, the verb classes are defined by
further formal requirements specific to each. Defining characteristics of intransitive vs.
transitive verbs are summarized in the following table:

When attached to a stem ending with a glottalized vowel (V’), this vowel is reinterpreted
as a V)V sequence: the glottal stop is discrete, and the second vowel, which is syllabic,
echoes the first.

This includes mid vowels, which are restricted from bearing nasality in most contexts (cf.

effect of its phonetic context rather than an underlying trait.

The suffix 4rì is only found on transitive verbs (7.3.2.1.2), where it marks the Perfect

this suggests that 4rì satisfies (or at least relieves) transitivity requirements.

The suffix 4na is a dummy object marker which is found with verbal nouns derived from
transitive verbs, whether they are used as nouns (5.9) or used verbally (as in the

7.3.1.5 Pronominal object suffixes
Three object pronouns are verb word suffixes: second person singular (7.3.1.5.1), third
person singular (7.3.1.5.2), and the 4zíná variant of the 1&2 person plural (7.3.1.5.3). In
all three cases, there is morphophonological evidence of these suffixes’ interdependence
with the verb word; such evidence is lacking for other object pronouns (6.1.3.1).
7.3.1.5.1 The second person singular object suffix -mi
The second person singular object is a verb word suffix 4mi.

7.4.1.1.1.2 Perfect
The Perfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a point
in time contemporaneous with the sequence of events in a discourse (typically the
present). It is structured differently for intransitive and transitive verbs. For intransitive
verbs and detransitivized transitive verbs (7.3.2.1), reflexive suffixes are used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone (see 7.3.2.2.3)) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì hèè4ní
I have climbed
1SG climb:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò hèè4ró
you (pl.) have climbed
2PL climb:PERF-REFL-2PL.REFL343For typical transitive verbs, a Perfect suffix 4rì (7.3.1.3) is used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone) + 4rì

stem and a H suffix; * = replacive melody, i.e., dominates the entire verb word; see
7.3.2.2.3.)
Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. As is evident, the tonal nature of
Perfect forms in some tonal classes is complex: while Class 1 (CVX intransitive only)
and Class 2 exhibit a floating H tone on the left boundary of the verb word, some other
Classes (4, transitive only; 5; and 6) exhibit a replacive melody that applies to the Perfect
verb word as a whole. The tonal behaviour of these forms is reviewed in 7.3.2.2.3.
There is no negative form of the Perfect; negated Perfect constructions use negative
perfective forms (7.5.1).
7.4.1.1.1.3 Pluperfect
The Pluperfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a
point in time subsequent to the event but prior to the point of reference in a discourse.
The Pluperfect is found with intransitive verbs as well as transitive verbs that take
reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2). It is typically structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbIndicative pronoun (CV) stem (Pluperfect tone) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì Qáá4ní

1SG move.away:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò Qáà4ró

2PL move.away:PERF-2PL.REFL
As is the case with the basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1) and Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2), third person
singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the Perfect are marked with
a zero pronoun.

Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negated forms of the Pluperfect

7.4.1.1.2 Imperfective
The Imperfective is used for events which, in reference to a given point in time, happen
but are not completed. In addition to carrying a generic imperfective meaning, it often
communicates a habitual meaning. Usually the events are anchored in the present, but as
the example at the end of this section shows, they may be expressed as events in the past.
Represented by a single tense, the Imperfective is typically expressed simply by using a
Realis subject pronoun (6.1.2) with a verbal noun (5.9). As is explained in the section on
verbal nouns, a comparable situation is found in the well-known case of Hausa
(Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages such as
Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).","[359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"3157.3.1.1 The verbal plural affix 4zí
The verbal affix 4zí is used to specify plurality for three of the five plural persons (6.1.1):
first-and-second (1&2) person, third person, and third person co-referential. For the 1&2
person and the third person, its importance is obvious, since plurality is not specified for
the subject pronoun; singular and plural verbal subject pronouns are identical (6.1.1.5).
For plurals of these three persons, the affix 4zí is obligatory when there is no reflexive
suffix on the verb, as the following singular/plural pairs show:
nàá
1&2:IRRhèè

1&2:IRRhèè4zí

they (coref.) will climb
3PL.COREF:IRR climb:FUT-PL
When third person plural or third person plural co-referential reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2)
are found on the verb word, the presence of 4zí is optional and serves only to make the
plurality of the subject explicit. This is shown in the following plural examples:
)àá
3:IRRhèè4ré
they will climb
climb:FUT-3PL.REFL= )àá

3PL.COREF:IRR climb:FUT-PL-3PL.REFL316However, there is no optional use of 4zí to mark plurality on verbs with a 1&2 person
plural reflexive suffix; plurality is already explicit in the suffix (which in turn appears to
have historically subsumed the form and role of 4zí).

A set of reflexive suffixes is used to mark subject agreement on most intransitive
(7.3.2.1) and detransitivized (7.3.2.1.2) verb forms. The suffix set, which resembles
many of the other pronominal sets (6.1), is as follows:

4réThird person and third person co-referential reflexive suffixes are identical. They
resemble co-referential object pronouns (6.1.3), and may have originated from these
historically.
Long and short forms of the 1&2 person plural reflexive suffix, 4zínzá and 4zíná, are
also found in other pronominal paradigms (see 6.1.3, 6.1.4).
A number of morphophonological alternations accompany the application of reflexive
suffixes to verb stems. This is evident with the second person singular reflexive suffix 4
mi ~ 4nVgm (7.3.1.2.1) as well as r-initial and nasal-initial reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2.2
and 7.3.1.2.3). In addition, the irregular verb vè ‘go’ exhibits extensive suffix-to-stem
vowel assimilation (7.3.3.1).
7.3.1.2.1 The second person singular reflexive suffix 4mi ~ 4nVgm
When attached to a stem ending with a long vowel other than a glottalized vowel, the
second person singular reflexive suffix is realized as 4mi.","[332, 333, 334]"
"87A similar objection to a consonantal interpretation of glottalic articulations originates in
an observation on the language style used in Mambay choral music (this style includes
both traditional dance music and church music). Importantly, in choral lyrics there is no
glottalic quality in open syllable rhymes, even in articulations which in spoken language
are glottalic. In other words, open glottalic rhymes are sung as unmodified vocalic
rhymes. This differs from morpheme-initial glottal stops and preglottalized consonants,
where glottalic articulations are retained in singing.
This first interpretation, where glottalic articulations in this position are contrastive
realizations of an independently occurring glottal stop, is faced with a major difficulty in
unambiguously closed syllables. As is the case for a consonantal interpretation of
pharyngeal articulations, it would lead to the creation of CC codas and, consequently, the
recognition of new superheavy syllable types (cf. 2.4.3). For example, the word d[èm] ~
d[è)m] ‘comment (v.)’ would be interpreted as a CVCC sequence d4è4)4m (or d4è4)4
Nm). The positing of such syllables causes the same difficulties as have been discussed in
2.3.3.2.4.
However, a second possibility exists for a consonantal interpretation of glottalic
articulations in unambiguously closed syllable rhymes: namely, that glottalization is part
of the coda consonant (V-NC). Importantly, this rhyme sequence never contrasts with V’C or V’-NC rhymes. A review of attested glottalic articulations in such syllables
(2.3.3.3.1.1), when compared with the inventory of contrastive glottalized consonants
(2.1.1), shows that in the vast majority of cases, a closed glottalic rhyme could be
interpreted as an unmodified vowel followed by a preglottalized consonant. Thus, a word
like d[èm] ~ d[è)m] ‘comment (v.)’ would be analyzed as a CVC sequence d4è4Nm.
The only difficulty facing this interpretation is the presence of four irregular verbal nouns
in the data, in which a glottalic articulation accompanies the consonant r within a syllable
rhyme (there are no other words with this configuration):
[)ár]và ~ [)á)ár]vàrun (VN) (cf. )à’ (perfective))Nm[ ír]và ~ Nm[ í)ír]và go down (VN) (cf. mì’ (perfective))
k[ír]và ~ k[í)ír]vàgrow to a gigantic size (VN) (cf. kì’ (perfective))m[ár]và ~ m[á)ár]vàmake a sound (VN) (cf. mà’ (perfective))These four examples are ambiguous, and it is evident from the consonant inventory
presented in 2.1.1 that there are no unambiguous examples of a contrastive preglottalized
counterpart Nr. Thus, a CVC interpretation is problematic for CVNr rhymes, which in
addition exhibit phonetic characteristics slightly different than those containing other
consonants in the same position (2.3.3.3.1.1). If a CVC analysis is adhered to for all
other glottalized articulations in closed rhymes, three possibilities are available to account
for CV Nr sequences:881) even though Nr only occurs ambiguously, it should be classified as part of the
consonant inventory;
2) the four words with CVNr rhymes should be analyzed as containing exceptional
CVCC syllables; or
3) the verbal nouns in which CVNr rhymes are found should be analyzed as
morphologically complex.
The first explanation is obviously weak, since contrast or another strong argument should
be demonstrated for each segment in the consonant inventory. The second explanation
exhibits the same weakness in relation to the syllable inventory (note that, if adhered to, it
would create additional ambiguity by alleviating the necessity of a CVC interpretation for
other unambiguously closed glottalic syllable rhymes).
The third explanation, however, deserves further consideration; and since CVNr rhymes
are only found in four words, it is useful to examine these words. One pattern that
emerges is that all four words have a nasalized first syllable. While there may be a
historical explanation for this, nasality does not appear to provide insight into the
preferability of any of the three interpretations. More promising in this regard is the
likelihood of morphological complexity. All four words are irregular verbal nouns and,
as shown in their presentation above, each may be identified with a source verb stem.
However, in the description of verbal nouns (5.9.2), it is stated that fossilized verbal
nouns are structured in (almost) the same way as other nouns, including the historical
noun suffixes that are found with most of them. Although there are correspondences
between irregular verbal nouns and the verbs from which they originate, these
correspondences are varied and in many cases idiosyncratic. Consequently, the
morphological boundary between verbal noun root and verbal noun suffix is probably
better considered a historical boundary.
In the end, the third explanation does not provide a way out of the interpretive difficulties
which CVNr sequences pose to a consonantal interpretation of glottalic articulations. It is
possible that, as suggested by the second explanation, CVCC syllables have arisen or are
arising in the language as a result of morphological reconfigurations driven by historical
processes such as that which has generated irregular verbal nouns.
2.3.3.3.3 A vocalic interpretation of glottalic articulations
The most basic argument in support of a vocalic interpretation for glottalic articulations
in syllable rhymes is the fact that such articulations are always realized at least on
vowels. A vocalic interpretation maintains that although glottalic articulations are
underlyingly vocalic, they may be phonetically realized with an accompanying
consonantal quality in some environments (cf. 2.3.3.3.1).
Simply put, the only other factors in support of a vocalic interpretation are those which
stand in opposition to a consonantal interpretation (0).
One oddity resulting from a uniform vocalic interpretation of glottalic articulations in
syllable rhymes is a complete absence of preglottalized consonants in this position. In
89cases where preglottalized consonants in syllable onsets are resyllabified as coda
consonants due to morphophonological processes (see especially the free/linked
alternation of nouns in 5.2.2.2), the glottalic quality of the rhyme would be reassigned to
the preceding vowel (recall phonetic realizations and the discussion of the relationship
between % and l specified in 2.3.3.3.1.1):
pá à
milk+ )íí
*pâ’b )íí my milk (cf. preferable form pâ )íí)
1SG.POSSwá%à
+ )íí
*wâ’l )íí my boule with sauce (cf. preferable
form wâ% )íí)
boule with sauce
1SG.POSS
This is unfortunate, because it promotes a phonological identity for these coda
consonants which is less defendable than one where a glottalized consonant retains its
identity even when it has been reassigned to a new syllable position. In addition, it masks
the phonetically salient contrast between glottalized vowel / non-glottalic consonant and
non-glottalized vowel / preglottalized stop sequences across a syllable boundary (2.3.2).
Also, as is the case for pharyngealized vowels (2.3.3.2), there would be no contrast
between short and long glottalized vowels. Further, it would be unclear whether these
vowels which do not have a contrast in length were underlyingly short, long, or both.
What would be interpreted as glottalized vowels are found in some environments in
which short vowels are never found, such as nouns consisting of a single open syllable
(5.1.1.1):
faF’
kâ’
naF’mouse sp.
medicine, care
side chamberIn contrast, with an across-the-board vocalic interpretation these vowels would be found
in closed syllables, an environment where, with the exception of five non-canonical
words (2.4.3), long vowels are not found unambiguously. Example words containing
syllables which would have to be interpreted as long vowels followed by a consonant
have been given in 2.3.3.3.1.1 above.
2.3.3.3.4 Conclusion
In sum, each interpretation of glottalic articulations is significantly limited. While
arguments in favour of a consonantal interpretation are stronger than those for a vocalic
interpretation, so are objections toward it. Also, as is the case for pharyngealized vowels,
a suprasegmental interpretation does not provide additional insight into the issue.
Bohnhoff’s (1976, 1987) ad hoc positing of structurally discrete “double vowels” a is
convenient interpretation, but has yet to be integrated into a theory of segment and
syllable structure.
For the remainder of this study, a split interpretation has been followed in regards to
length. For syllables which are otherwise open, glottalic articulations have been
90interpreted as long glottalized vowels phonologically parallel to pharyngealized vowels
(2.3.3.2). In light of the lack of contrast between V’-C, V-NC and V’-NC rhymes, and
considering the identical articulation of these syllable rhymes with those containing
unambiguous preglottalized stops in syllable onsets which have been resyllabified as
codas (2.1.3.2), glottalic articulations in closed syllable rhymes with consonants other
than r are treated as short unmodified vowels followed by glottalic consonants. Syllablefinal V-glottal-r sequences, which do pattern neatly with either of these other groupings
(0), are treated as short glottalized vowels followed by a non-glottalized consonant.
2.3.3.4 Rhymes ending in high vowels and semivowels
There is no contrast between syllable rhymes ending in high vowels and those ending in
semivowels (non-glottalized or glottalized). Rhymes which exhibit a single place of
articulation are interpreted as long vowels rather than VC sequences. This interpretation
assures that the inventories of long and glottalized vowels (2.2.1) are complete.

A moderately productive class-changing derivation changes monosyllabic ideophonic

The morphological template for adjective derivation reduplicates a monosyllabic

The description of ideophones in previous sections has focussed on examples whose
syntactic behaviour and morphological classification is unambiguous; however, as many
ideophones are used in more than one syntactic context, a description of class
membership possibilities is essential.
Specifically, a minority of ideophones may be used variously as adjectives, ideophonic
adverbs and—to a lesser degree—ideophonic nouns, and are structurally identical
regardless of usage. This could be viewed as pervasive zero-derivation; however,
because of overlap in possible base structures, the direction of such a derivational
phenomenon is in many cases indeterminate. More appropriate is a recognition of
flexible class membership possibilities available to ideophones.
The following are representative examples of ideophones found in more than one word
class:

—(In addition the structural and derivational tendencies outlined in previous sections,
ideophonic adverbs have been distinguished from adjectives based on their dependence
on the presence of a verb (rather than a neighbouring noun) and their relegation to postverbal position. Adjectives have been distinguished from nouns based on the syntactic
criteria outlined in 8.4.1.)407Patterns of flexible class membership deserve further investigation. A cursory
observation on flexibly used ideophones in the data (which is, incidentally, borne out in
the examples immediately above) reveals that while some ideophones used as adjectives
share distribution with adverbs or nouns, nouns and adverbs never share distribution
unless an adjective is also implicated. This supports the idea that in Mambay, adjectives
are situated on a morphological continuum between ideophonic adverbs and ideophonic
nouns.
In some cases, derived ideophones also show flexible word class membership. The most
complete example of derivational potential is that of word kàhm ‘rapidly, with agility.’
In each of three separate derivations, this morpheme exhibits distributional potential as
adjective, ideophonic adverb, and noun. All of the following forms and usages are

MINOR WORD CLASSES
9MINOR WORD CLASSESIn the present chapter, three minor word classes are introduced: numerals (9.1), specifiers
(9.2), and prepositions (9.3).
Structurally, these three word classes resemble the major word classes of nouns (Chapter
5) and verbs (Chapter 7) as well as adverbs and adjectives (Chapter 8) in that their
members are typically comprised of at least one heavy syllable or two light syllables (cf.
2.4.3); this sets them apart from particles, which are uniformly comprised of a single light
syllable (2.4.3, 10.1.2). However, they diverge in that whereas nouns, verbs, adverbs and
adjectives are lexically open classes, numerals, specifiers and prepositions are
represented by closed lexical sets.","[422, 423, 424, 425, 426]"

109Minimal domain of association
Nasality requires a specific minimal domain in order to associate. Minimal domains are
as follows (the first four of these five domains have already been delineated in 3.4.1):
- a nasal coda (ex. vbòm ‘divide’);
- a long vowel (ex. záá ‘pull’);
- a nasal(-ized) onset plus a nasal(-ized) nucleus (ex. núg ‘sleep (tr.)’);
- a nasal(-ized) nucleus plus a nasal(-ized) coda (ex. zìr ‘gnaw’); or
- two short vowels separated by a nasal(-ized) sonorant (ex. gùrá ‘crane’).
Thus, within a morpheme, nasality may be limited to a single nasal consonant if that
consonant is in syllable-final position (3.4.1; see also 3.4.2 immediately above).

minimal domain of nasality in morphemes with more than one syllable: a nasalized short
vowel in an open syllable is only found when there is another nasalized vowel in the
morpheme, and the two vowels are separated by a nasal(-ized) sonorant. A single
divergence from this pattern is the allowing of short nasalized vowels in the first syllable
after a nasal consonant if an obstruent begins the second syllable. Thus, plausible
morphemes of the following types are absent (C here refers to any type of consonant):
1. *CVC ;
2. *C CV (except for N OV, which is permitted).","[126, 127]"
"8.3.1 Distribution of ideophonic adverbs
Ideophonic adverbs are found in post-verbal position (cf. TAM adverbs; see 7.6.1.2).
Clause constituents such as objects, directional adverbs and locational complements may
be interposed between a verb and the ideophonic adverb which modifies it (10.1.1).
The syntactic distribution of ideophonic adverbs is illustrated by the following text
(found in its entirety at the end of this study), where these adverbs are found in their
typical post-verbal position at the end of three of the five clauses which have been
chained together in a story’s climax.

related values (6.1.1). Pronouns are used to mark subjects (6.1.2), objects (6.1.3) and
possessors (6.1.4). Each category of personal pronoun is found with a corresponding set
of emphatic pronouns (6.1.5).

1&2SG.POSSour (your (sg.) and my) stoolFrom a numeric point of view, these pronouns are dual rather than singular. However, in
the pronominal system, they pattern as singular by virtue of a grammaticalized opposition
to the 1&2 plural pronouns (cf. Thomas 1955:207–8, Corbett 2000:166–9, Cysouw
2003:85–90, 260–4 and 2005:5). 1&2 plural pronouns refer to a communication dyad
with a speaker, an addressee, and at least one other participant. The “other(s)” may be
aligned with either the speaker or the addressee.

1&2PL.POSSour (your and our / your (pl.) and my) stoolIn the above examples, it is evident that the form of the 1&2 singular is similar to that of
the plural (this is also the case in Duru; see Bohnhoff 1986:104, 129 footnote 3). In fact,
for verbal subject pronouns, 1&2 singular and plural forms are identical; the singular vs.
plural distinction is instead formalized on verbs through the use of the verbal plurality
affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verb stems.

contains a morpheme with the consonant z. This underlines the 1&2 plural’s formal
alignment with other explicit plural marking in the language, which is also typically
found with z (5.5, 5.9.2.1, 7.3.1.1).
An alternative presentation of the same system using the more familiar distinctions of
inclusive vs. exclusive and singular vs. dual vs. plural has also been considered. In such
a presentation, the 1&2 singular slot shown above would be labelled “first person
inclusive dual” and the 1&2 plural slot would be labelled “first person inclusive plural”;
also—and importantly—the first person plural slot described in this study would be recast
as “first person exclusive plural.” Such a description is provided for a parallel system in
Margi (a Chadic language of Nigeria) by Hoffman (1963:72ff.). The two presentations
may be compared as follows:

1PL.EXCL2SG2PL2SG2PL1&2SG1&2PL3SG3PL3SG3PL3SG.COREF3PL.COREF3SG.COREF3PL.COREFThe latter presentation, which relies on more familiar distinctions, falls short in that it sets
up a dual vs. plural opposition, even though a “dual” category is not grammaticalized
elsewhere in the Mambay pronoun system (or anywhere in the language, for that matter;
see Thomas 1955:205, Plank 1996 and Cysouw 2003:87–8). In contrast, the presentation
with 1&2SG/PL slots recognizes a communication dyad as a basic person category; as
such, it brings out symmetry in the applicability of plurality to 1&2 person pronouns and
inherently singular pronouns (Greenberg 1988:3–4). The semantic confusion that arises
from the labelling of a “you-and-I” (i.e., 1&2SG) pronoun as singular can be addressed by
considering this pronoun, along with the inherently singular pronouns, as “minimal”;
remaining pronouns could be considered “augmented,” since they all involve the addition
of “other” persons to “minimal” slots (Bohnhoff 1986:104, Beavon 1986:175, Corbett
2000:199–9, Cysouw 2003:85–90, 2005:5).","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"

INTRODUCTION
1INTRODUCTIONTo the north of the Adamawa Massif and approximately eight hundred kilometres from
the Gulf of Guinea, the Mambay ethnic group straddles the border of Cameroon and
Chad. Members of the group, numbering about fifteen thousand, live along the Mayo
Kebbi (Kebbi River) at the point where it flows south-west from Chad toward its
confluence with the Benue River in Cameroon.
The Mambay language belongs to the Adamawa-Ubangi family, a group which has been
considered “probably the most poorly documented of all the major divisions of NigerCongo” (Bennett 1983:23). Researchers have overlooked this language family—
especially the Adamawa branch of which Mambay is a part—due to its distance from the
coast, the small populations of many of its constituent groups, and their dispersal among
larger, unrelated languages. Other possible reasons for this situation include the
Adamawa languages’ distance from urban centres as well as the sheer number and
diversity of languages in this linguistically fragmented area of west-central Africa
(Bennett 1983:23, Boyd 1978:190, Samarin 1971:217).
Consequently, despite
Strümpell’s identification of the language as early as 1910, Mambay has long managed to
elude serious investigation. Those studies in which Mambay is mentioned (1.2.1) are for
the most part concerned with the still-unresolved genetic structure of the larger language
groupings of which it is a part, and give little information on the language itself.
The present research responds to this lacuna by providing an in-depth description of the
Mambay language, with a focus on phonology and morphology.
In the following sections of this chapter, the Mambay ethnic group is introduced within
its historical context (1.1). This is accompanied by an overview of the Mambay language
which gives attention to the current sociolinguistic situation and existing linguistic
exploration, including genetic classification (1.2).
Finally, the framework and
methodology of this study are presented (1.3).","[16, 17, 18]"
"10.1.2.2 The affirmative particle yó
The affirmative particle yó ‘indeed’ has the effect of affirming a clause or putting focus
on an Indicative clause constituent. When it is simply juxtaposed with a noun, a
presentational clause or an answer results.
kwéé yó
Kwe indeedhere is Kwe / it is KweWith the exception of interrogative pronouns (6.2), sentences consisting of a single word
are not permitted; thus, in cases where a noun is used to answer a question—as shown by
the preceding example—it is always accompanied by yó.
The particle yó may also be applied to complete verbless clauses (10.1.3).
