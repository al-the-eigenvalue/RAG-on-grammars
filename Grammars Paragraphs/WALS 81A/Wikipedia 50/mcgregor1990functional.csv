distinctive, and stress has a purely delimitative function (Trubetzkoy 1969:27).
Words almost always begin with a consonant, very rarely with a consonant
cluster; the apical distinction is neutralised word initially. Word medially a fairly
large number of two member consonant clusters occur. Non-verbal roots are
nearly all disyllabic or longer and typically end in vowels. Verbal roots are
phonotactically unusual (cf. Dixon 1980: 159): a large number are monosyllabic,
and many end in consonants, occasionally consonant clusters.
Lexical words may be divided into three main classes or parts-of-speech,
each with a number of subclasses: nominals, verbals, and adverbials. These are
open classes, each with a large number of members. Pronominals constitute a
distinct closed class and distinguish three persons and two numbers. Instead of
the inclusive/exclusive distinction normally found in the first person nonsingular in Australian languages, Gooniyandi makes a restricted/unrestricted
distinction. In this system, the unrestricted pronominal refers to the speaker, the
hearer, and at least one other individual; the restricted pronominal refers either to
the speaker and the hearer, or to the speaker and one or more persons other than
the hearer. In terms of the traditional categories, the unrestricted pronominal
corresponds to first person plural (more than two) inclusive, while the restricted
pronominal corresponds to the first person dual (either inclusive or exclusive) or
the first person plural exclusive.
Noun classes are not distinguished in Gooniyandi, and nominals do not
inflect for number or case. Instead, number and case information is conveyed by
means of phrase-level enclitics, which are referred to in this book as
postpositions. There are number-marking postpositions distinguishing dual and
plural numbers, and case-marking postpositions conveying ergative, dative,
ablative, allative, locative, and other local meanings. Gooniyandi nominal
phrase marking is not split ergative (Silverstein 1976b, Dixon 1979): any NP
regardless of its person or number may be ergatively marked. The ergative
postposition is, however, optional for all phrase types in the 'transitive subject'
function. Word order in the NP is free in the sense that determiners and
adjectives may precede or follow the nominal they modify. However, the NP
may be described in terms of a fixed sequence of functions or roles that the
constituent words realise.
The verbal complex has properties characteristic of both phrases and words.
It is phrase-like in its position on the rank scale (Halliday 1961/1976): it is a
clausal constituent whose ""granddaughters"" are items of morpheme rank; it is
word-like in that it is a single distributional unit, the constituents of whichlANGUAGE TYPE3occur in a fixed order. There are two obligatory constituents in the verbal
complex: a verbal stem, which always occurs initially, and a 'classifier
complex'. This classifier complex consists of, in the following order: a tense
marking prefix, bound pronominal prefixes which cross-reference certain actants
in the clause, and a 'classifier'. The tense system distinguishes four tenses (past,
present, irrealis and future); the pronominal prefixes on the whole inflect on a
nominative-accusative pattern, and generally show the same person and number
distinctions as do the free pronominals; and the classifiers distinguish twelve
classes of processes (based on aspectual type and valence, to put it loosely). In
addition the verbal complex may have one or more of a number of optional
constituents which provide aspectual and modal qualification, and a further
system of bound pronominals referring to other ('oblique') actants. Although
these constituents occur in a fixed order, their phonemic shapes, and the
boundaries between them, are frequently obscured by morphophonemic
processes.
Spatial adverbs, indicating location and direction, are frequent in motion
(and other) clauses: compass directions are used in preference to left-right
orientation, and temporal sequence is expressed by spatial metaphor. There are
also temporal and manner adverbials.
Modality and other forms of speaker evaluation of a proposition are
encoded in free particles (marking negation, mistaken belief, retribution,
repetition, certainty, uncertainty, and so on} and enclitics (carrying meanings
like 'only', 'again', 'else', 'like', 'etcetera', and so on).
Two main types of clause, verbal and verbless, are distinguishable,
depending on whether or not there is an inherent (see page 293 below) verbal
complex. Verbal clauses show four (not two- cf. Dixon 1980:278ft) distinct
'transitivity' types: intransitive, transitive, middle and reflexive/reciprocal. These
are defined by the ""case frames"" of the inherent nominal phrase constituents.
Intransitive clauses take a single unmarked NP; transitive clauses have a phrase
which may be ergatively marked and an unmarked phrase; middle clauses have a
phrase which may be ergatively marked together with a dative phrase; and
reflexive/reciprocal clauses have a single phrase, which is optionally ergatively
marked. Verbless clauses are either attributive, identifying, or existential. As in
the majority of Australian languages, constituent order is 'free' (Dixon
1980:441), in the sense that changing it does not affect the referential or
experiential meaning (Halliday 1974:47) of a clause. Constituent order is,
however, significant in respect of the textual organisation of the clause (Halliday
1974:47) - that is, the way in which the clause is organised as a message4INTRODUCTIONbearing unit. In particular, Gooniyandi is a theme-first language.
Clause complexes consist of paratactically or hypotactically related clauses.
However, it is impossible to distinguish these two types (or any others) on
purely formal criteria. There are no morphological markers signalling the
interclausal relationships, no structural differences between constituent clauses of
clause complexes and independent clauses, and no necessary cross-clause
reference relations (see Matthiessen and Thompson forthcoming, and compare
Dixon 1980:461). The clause complex types have linguistic validity as COVERT
categories (Wharf 1945/1972: 104). There is, however, a close connection
between subordination and mood, whereby subordinate clauses always have their
verb in a marked, non-indicative mood, either subjunctive or factive.","[14, 15, 16, 17]"

ACC(b)ERGPP NOM

OBLMiddle:
ERGPP NOM
DATPP OBLRemarks:(1) The reflexive/reciprocal construction in Gooniyandi is typologically unusual:
in most ergative languages in which the reflexive/reciprocal is verbally encoded
the one obligatory constituent is an unmarked or 'absolutive' one (Edmonson
1978:646-647). It is normally only in those ergative languages in which it is
not verbally encoded that the inherent constituent is an ergatively marked one.
And in keeping with Edmonson's typology, in the Pama-Nyungan languages to
the south of Gooniyandi, Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:66), Wangkajunga (my
fieldnotes), Nyangumarta (Nash 1980:205), which also have the obligatory
constituent in the ergative, the reflexive/reciprocal is realised by an enclitic
pronominal, and is not a feature of the verb.
(2) Unlike a number of so called ""ergative"" languages, ergative marking in
Gooniyandi occurs on all phrase types, irrespective of person (cf. Dixon 1979).
However it is optional: in each of the clause types marked above as having an
ERG PP, the ERG postposition may be omitted, and the participant role may be
realised by an NP instead. There is however a strong correlation between
inanimacy and the realisation by an ERG PP. An inanimate in the appropriate
role is almost invariably realised by an ERG PP.
The exact significance of the presence vs. absence of the postposition remains
unclear. It might be remarked, however, that its main function is not simply to
di~tinguish between the ""subject"" and the ""object"" (to use these terms loosely,
Wlth the obvious senses), as has been claimed with respect to a number of
'optionally ergative' languages, such as Dalabon (Capell 1962: 111), Murrinhpatha (Walsh 1976:405), Motu, etc. (cf. Dixon 1979:71). That this is the case
should be clear from the following observations: In two of the clause types in
which ERG PPs occur, reflexive/reciprocal and middle, it is clear that the ERG is
not needed to distinguish between any roles. Secondly, there are many instances'l··I

"Order of entities is expressed by spatial metaphor using the orientation
types (d), rather than through a set of ordinal numbers. Thus, objects may be
ordered wilangi 'leading, first', or balyjoowa 'following, non-lrrst'. Time is also
ordered in this way, previous time being referred to as wilangi 'ahead', and
present and future time as baljoowa 'behind'. ""Same time"" also finds a similar

"I distinguish these clauses initially on intuitive-functional grounds. What
they do is establish associations between non-linguistic referent entities and their
linguistic designations. They do not establish associations between alternative
designations for an object, as do intensive identifying clauses, in which both
NPs are (presumed) cognitively significant to the hearer, and so capable of being
understood to refer to something. In other words, the second NP in naming
Identifying clauses, the name, is used as a representative of itself; it has no
""mental referentn (Fawcett 1980:90). However, there is evidence that they are
grammatically distinct in Gooniyandi. The evidence comes from two main
sources. Firstly, the order of the phrases appears to be fixed; the clauses are
always encoding. Secondly, alone among identifying clauses naming clauses
have situation clause agnates, in which there is an inherent Identifier and an
inherent Identified. This agnate clause involves the verballexeme goowaj- 'call
(by) name':
(5-13) nginyji goowajgingga

I:call:you
'I call you husband.'ngoombarna
husbandIt should be noted that naming clauses have alternative interpretations as
intensive identifying clauses in which both phrases are used referentially (cf.
Kuno and Wongkhomthong 1981:89). For example, (5-12) might be used to
identify the speaker as the individual whose name is mentioned.",[282]
"Exemplifying clauses differ from intensive clauses in that (i) they have
indefinite Identifieds, whereas intensive identifying clauses always have definite
Identifieds, and (ii) the order of the roles is ftxed. These grammatical differences
might suggest that exemplifying clauses should be treated as a subtype of
characterising clauses (see page 299 below). However, there is a crucial
difference: if they were characterising clauses the order of roles would be
invariably Attribute""Carrier, as against the otherwise predominant
Carrier""Attribute order. Furthermore, the way in which these clauses were used
in the texts in which they occurred was to give further examples of particular
categories. In this sense they are ""identifying"" -they pick out certain items
from a larger class of (potential) referents, as do decoding intensive identifying
clauses.
[3] Naming identifying clauses. I use the term ""naming"" because one of
the NPs provides a name for the other. Such clauses always involve the
association of Identified and Token, and Identifier and Value. I encountered
Clauses of this type a number of times in learning Gooniyandi, especially when
my teachers pointed out things to me in picture books or in the environment and
named them. Some examples are:

to circumstances of teaching non-speakers the names of objects. They are also298THE CLAUSEused in identifying personal names and relationship tenns to be used between
individuals, as in:

"5.6.2.2.3 Enhancement
Here the relationship between the subordinate clause and the constituent it
modifies is a circumstantial one of place. That is, the thing referred to by the
modified constituent (either a nominal phrase, or an adverbial) fulfils a
circumstantial role of location in the enhancing clause; by contrast, in extension
(5.6.2.2.1) the thing fulfils a participant role in the extending clause, or is a part
of a participating entity. The clausal constituent modified may be either a
nominal phrase (NP or PP), or a spatial adverbial, referring to (or implying) a443CLAUSE COMPLEXESplace. The enhancing clause (like the extending clause discussed above) always
occurs in final position in the clause complex, typically next to the constituent
of the primary clause that it modifies. That is, the qualified referent is normally
new, and the unmarked focus of the primary clause - and as such it always
finds overt realisation in that clause. (It is of course normally ellipsed in the
following enhancing clause.) Furthermore, the enhancing clause is inv~bly in
the factive mood. This clause always occurs in final position in the clause
complex, usually next to the modified constituent in the primary clause. An
example is

5.6.2.2.4 Concluding remarks
We have seen that as a rule the elaborating clause and the subclausal constituent
it modifies (in case it is not ellipsed) are as a rule immediately next to one
another. They might be regarded as juxtaposed; however, the two do not together
form a unit complex, as is the case in other juxtapositions. The clause either
precedes the constituent it modifies, or follows it. These possibilities appear to
be another reflection of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent and
reference modification (discussed above, section 4.1.2.2). As was the case within444THE CLAUSEthe NP, material preceding the referring expression (in the primary clause) serves
to modify its reference, whilst material following it serves to modify the
referent5.6.2.3 Linguistic significance of the types
The full range of logico-semantic and tactic relations that exist between the
clauses of a complex are schematised in the following table.

To conclude this discussion of clause complexes I will briefly enquire into
the linguistic status of the above relationships, addressing the question as toClAUSE COMPLEXES445whether the types merely interpretations engendered by the context, and have. no
linguistic significance (cf. Hale 1976:86, and McKay 1988). I will look atthe
tactic relationships frrst, then at the logico-semantic ones.
In all clause types identified in the table, one clause, the PRIMARY clause;
carries the main burden of the message. The other clause(s) carry less important
information, and will be referred to as SECONDARY clauses. Parataxis and
hypotaxis may be distinguished in terms of the order relationships that may
obtain between the primary and secondary clauses.
In clause complexes of the types listed in the frrst column of Table 5-2,
the primary clause is the one which comes frrsl In enhancement, the enhancing
clause, which always comes second, expresses a situation secondary to the
situation enhanced upon. (Where the situations are temporally successive, the
most important one is the one occurring frrst: in general, the occurrence of the
second is dependent on the occurrence of the frrst. Furthermore, I would argue
that the fact that the clauses are conjoined indicates that the speaker does evaluate
the event frrst to occur as the most important; otherwise, s/he could have chosen
to use two isolated clause-sentences.) In the case of addition, as in English, the
first clause expresses the situation that the speaker evaluates as the most
important: in (5-366) the most important part of the message concerns getting
the hearer to do something. Similar remarks apply to the other relations of in
the parataxis column. At frrst sight it may appear that in identification the
opposite order occurs, i.e. that the secondary precedes the primary clause: here
the identifying clause, which corresponds to relative clauses in languages such as
English, always occurs first. But closer examination of the facts shows that this
type does not in fact contradict the ordering principle. This type typically occurs
in the context in which the identifying clause carries the new infonnation, and
the following clause carries given information. Consider for example (5-223)
above, in which the final clause of B's response is information given in A's
question.
It is clear that in clause complexes of the types listed in the second column
of Table 5-2, the primary clause is always the one in unmarked (or indicative)
mood; the secondary clause is always the one in a marked non-indicative mood.
Here clause order has nothing to do with the primary/secondary opposition;
where reversal of the order of the clauses is possible, it does not change the
status of the clauses as primary or secondary. This suggests the inherent
secondary status of clauses in non-indicative moods in these types of clause
complex. The clauses are of unequal status. On the other hand, the fact that
reversal of clauses in complexes from the first column of the table induces a446THE ClAUSEchange in the relative status of the clauses indicates their equal footing. This
justifies the distinction between parataxis and hypotaxis.
Turning now to the logical relationships, we fmd that in hypotactic clause
complexes the enhancing relationship of location may be distinguished from the
others by virtue of the fact that the order of clauses is fixed in the former, but
not in the latter relationships. In location, the subordinate clause always follows
the main clause; in the other hypotactic types, the subordinate clause more often
than not precedes the main clause. Condition is morphologically distinct from
identification and time, except in the future tense, where both condition and time
are realised by a subjunctive clause (I will return to this shortly). Identification
and time can be distinguished as follows: if there is, initial in the main clause,
an endophoric word referring to (and/or summarising) the subordinate clause, it
must be a determiner in identification, and the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus
manner' in time. In other words, identification and time are sometimes formally
distinct, and are in principle distinguishable. Similarly, it should be possible to
distinguish future temporals from future conditionals by the endophoric element
that may occur initially in the main clause. And it seems that only temporals
allow the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus manner'. The discussion of this paragraph
shows that the logical types in hypotaxis identified in the previous section have
linguistic validity as covert categories: they are distinguishable by agnation, and
not by form alone.
Things are not so clear for the various types of paratactic complexes, and it
is beyond the scope of this book to determine whether each of the logical types
identified above are linguistically significant. I will merely remark on the
statuses of constituent descriptives, constituent identification, and clausal
temporal inclusion. Identification stands out from the other paratactic
relationships by virtue of the fact that one of the endophoric determiners may
come initially in the secondary clause, and refer to the thing identified by the
primary clause. It would seem that constituent descriptives and clauses related by
temporal inclusion overlap, but do not coincide: clause complexes admitting the
latter interpretation admit the former only if the clauses share a nominal
constituent. Furthermore, neither of these two types appears to display a
linguistic property distinguishing them from clausal addition.
But constituent identification in parataxis stands out from the remaining
paratactic relations in other ways. Identification is the only logical relationship
common to both parataxis and hypotaxis. Indeed, paratactic identification may be
grouped together with hypotactic identification, conditionals, and temporals, in
terms of textual structure. In each of these the expanding clause typically comesCLAUSE COMPLEXES447first, and would appear to function as a type of thematic clause in the complex,
establishing a thing involved in, a place at which, a time when, or a condition
under which the situation referred to by the primary clause did or may occur. The
thing established may be referred to by an initial endophoric element in the
following, main clause. This makes the construction reminiscent of the thematic
option of reprise (cf. above page 375, and Grimes 1975). As we have seen, such
initial subordinate clauses always occur on their own, typically fall-rise;
intonation contour. This may be compared with the rising tone on reprised nonclausal themes (page 374 above).
For each of the types identified in the preceding paragraph, final position
for the expanding clause is far less frequent, and this clause may reasonably be
regarded as a type of afterthought, added to clarify an omitted (or ellipsed) theme;
the tone typically falls throughout, and is usually lower than the tone of the
primary clause. Thus, as suggested above, the two types of constituent
elaboration, characterisation and clarification, are merely thematic variants of
identification. The subordinate types are typically added when the theme is
something which has gone before, or is a presupposition, but which the speaker
ascertains the hearer may have difficulty in identifying; the paratactic type adds
new information of a peripheral nature. The four types, paratactic constituent
elaboration, hypotactic constituent elaboration, hypotactic conditionals, and
hypotactic temporals, may be grouped together and distinguished from the
remaining types by virtue of their possession of a theme-rheme structure. They
are thus in a sense more tightly structured, and more clause-like than the other
types.
It is now clear that a number of the types distinguished in the above
discussion do in fact have linguistic significance. This was shown by (1) formal
differences in the choice of moods and resuming determiners; (2) differences in
the significance of clause order; and (3) the fact that the class of complex
sentences allowing a particular interpretation differs from the class allowing
another interpretation. It remains true that many particular clause complex
tokens are multiply ambiguous. Presumably the interpretations are influenced by
the context of the text and the speech situation in which the particular complex
occurs. To take one example, (5-430) occurred in a context in which my
collaborator and I were discussing the previous work on the Gooniyandi
language. No previous mention had been made of this particular white person.

'Before a whiteman put some (Gooniyandi) words on paper, but he
died.'
The whiteman who put (Gooniyandi) words on paper before died.'
'Nthe whiteman put (Gooniyandi) words on paper and died.'
In this context, the first two interpretations are the most likely. Since the white
person had not yet been mentioned, the speaker might have intended that the frrst
clause establish such an individual, and mention as a further observation that
this man had died (in fact, the speaker was wrong here). Alternatively, he may
not have intended that the person be established in this way, but his identity left
indefinite, the point of the utterance being that although someone had previously
worked on the language, this was quite a while ago. If, however, the discourse
had been concerned with the exploits of a particular white person, the third
reading would be the most likely one. Naturally there are formal correlates of the
discourse and speech situation factors, showing up in the order of words in the
constituent clauses, whether or not they are ellipsed, etc. (cf. Merlan
1981:188ff). We cannot here attempt to identify factors influencing the
interpretations of particular examples.","[426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"
"THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATIONII359the VP, the situation obtained when (perhaps as a consequence ot) the quality
was attained. In the reverse order, the quality was evident when the situation
occurred. ((5-189) is only apparently a counterexample. The immediately
preceding clause was mangaddi gilbaali (not I:fmished:it) 'I didn't fmish it'thus the meaning intended was that I left it when it was in the condition of
being half done, not that when I left it it was (evidently) half done.)
Instead of indicating a quality obtaining throughout a situation, a
Conditional attribute may indicate an initial quality or state which obtained
when the situation first took place, but which no longer holds. In this case, the
attribute is realised by an ABL PP. For example,
(5-195) giljiddijgi -nhingi goornagjawani woogoo bagiyawi
tadpole
ABL it:will:tum
frog
it:will:lie
From a tadpole it will tum into a frog.'
With extendible processes (see page 195 above), the suggestion is that the
situation holds for all subsequent states or qualities of the entity. Thus:
(5-196) mawoolyi -nhingi -ngga waddgoomjawoodda
children
ABL
ERG they:want:to:work
'They want to work from children.'
(5-197) mawoolyi ngirndaji binaddigmiwiddra lambalambardi -nhingi

ABL
We want to teach these children from little ones.'
(d) Capacity attributes. These indicate the role of the participant as s/he
enacts the situation; these are illustrated in the following examples:(5-198) ngooddoo waddgoomgiri doogman
that
he:works
stockman
'That man works as a stockman.'
(5-199) ngoolyoongoolyoo -ngga gajlimi

!.:I360..,,'THE CLAUSE[2] Circumstantial attributes. In situation clauses other than clauses of
being, the only circumstantial attributes are Locational. These ascribe a location
to the Medium (typically a Goal) as it is involved in the situation; they do not
locate the entire situation. Locational attributes usually occur in clauses of
transfer and holding. For example,
(5-201) gamba galinyjawila bagad -ja
water I:will:carry:it bucket LOC
'I'll carry the water in a bucket.'
(5-202) goorijgila marla -ya
I:hold:it hand LOC
1'm holding it in my hand.'
(5-203) manyi midda -ya
thiddangga
food hem LOC she:carries:it:on:her:head
'She carries the food on her head.'
In examples such as these, the LOC PP locates the Medium/Goal only, not the
whole situation. The PP always refers to a relatively small object at, in or on
which the Medium/Goal is located.
The locational phrase that occurs with the verb yood- 'put' in (5-204)
would also seem to be an attribute:
(5-204) ngaaddi yoodjingi gilirni -yarock
he:put:it grass LOC
'He put the money in the grass.'
This verb also occurs with a locational expression that locates the full process of
putting, such as birndiddi-ya (plain-LOC) 'on the plain', which would appear to
be a Locational circumstance.
5.3 Some aspects of the textual organisation of the Gooniyandi
clause
5.3.1 InformationTwo major aspects of the textual organisation of Gooniyandi utterances are
distinguished, following Halliday's suggestions for English. They are: (i)
INFORMATION, which is concerned with the given/new opposition; and (ii)
1HEMATISATION, which is concerned with the theme/rheme (or topic/comment)
opposition (Halliday 1967, 1970, and 1985). Information and thematisation
impose distinct and independent structures on utterances. As in Englisht
I~]·. :. ~cTHE TEXTIJAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE361information structure in Gooniyandi is expressed primarily prosodically, by
intonation features, and the thematic structure is realised through constituent
order. This section is concerned with information; thematisation is discussed in
the following section.
As has already been remarked, Gooniyandi discourse is highly elliptical. As
a rule, given or retrievable information is ellipsed. There are few restrictions on
either the word/morpheme class of elements that may be ellipsed, or on their
experiential role in the clause. The only exceptions are propositional modifiers
such as mangaddi 'no, not', yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed';
these particles are never ellipsed. There are, however, some striking differences
in the types of constituent that tend to be ellipsed depending on the generic type
of the text. In narrative texts of the type investigated for the purpose of this
description (see section 1.10), ellipsis of nominal expressions is rife, but verbal
complexes are almost never ellipsed. Expressions referring to the main
participants in a clause are particularly prone to being ellipsed, since they are
cross-referenced by bound pronominals in the verb - cross-referencing often
provides sufficient information about the participant to allow it to be identified.
A count over the fifteen texts investigated revealed that only about one in five
clauses had its full quota of inherent phrases. At the same time there were only
three or four cases in which a verb had been ellipsed; and in each of them, the
ellipsed verb belonged to the second clause of a 'correlative' construction the first
verb of which was lexically identical with it (see example (5-264) below).
On the other hand, in everyday conversation there is a greater tendency for
given verbal complexes to be ellipsed. (5-205) is a typical conversational
exchange.
(5-205) A: gardlooni
I: hit: him
B: ngoorndooga
by: someone
A: nganyingga
by:me
A: 1 hit him.'
B: Who did?' (B was rather deaf)
A: 1did.'
Gooniyandi texts are spoken as sequences of TONE UNITS, which carry
distinctive intonation contours. They are delimited in example sentences and the
texts by slashes. Tone units are typically bounded on each side by short pauses.","[343, 344, 345]"
"CHAPTER 6
TOPICS IN SEMANTICS
6.1 Preliminary remarksThis chapter is a preliminary investigation into the semantics of certain closed
class units, in particular, logical modifiers (section 6.2), enclitics (section 6.3),
particles (section 6.4), and the major categories of the finite verb (section 6.5).
Up to now these morphemes have been given approximate English glosses
only. Other closed class items including stem forming suffixes,
postpositions, pronominals, and infinitives- have already been discussed in
Chapter 3 above.
As in the previous chapters, the object of study is the linguistic sign, a
form-meaning correlation. Meaning, as we have seen (see page 323) must be
distinguished from reference, or the extra-linguistic ""reality"" referred to by a
particular utterance or sign in the utterance. Meaning and reference are not
identical; the former imposes a classification on the latter. On the other hand,
reference must be studied in order that linguistic meaning be determined. What is
different about the investigation of this chapter lies primarily in the nature of the
formal aspect of the sign. In Chapters 4 and 5 the forms were immediate
constituents of phrases and clauses - that is, entities with no unique shape in
terms of either their phonological or their lexical expression, and established by
means of contrast and complementary distribution. It is assumed in this chapter
that morphemes, the ultimate linguistic constituents which have meaning, arc
also signs. In this case, of course, the forms we are concerned with are primarily
(morpho)phonological. The sign is an association between a phonological and/or
a morphophonological form and a meaning. Qualifications must, of course, be
made regarding: (i) homophony, in which two distinct signs share a
phonological form; and (ii) allomorphy, in which a single sign has variant
phonological expressions.
The fundamental assumption of the approach to meaning adopted here is,
then, that each formal item or morpheme (with the exception of homonyms) has
associated with it a linguistic meaning which remains constant throughout all of450TOPICS IN SEMANTICSits uses. I will refer to this invariant of meaning as the FORMAL meaning of the
morpheme, following Ellis (1966:80). Other linguists have used terms such as
""core meaning"" (McConvell 1983a), ""grammatical meaning"" (King 1983), and
""common denominator of meaning"" or ""Gesamtbedeutung"" (Jak:obson 1936 and
Waugh 1975). This formal meaning must be distinguished from the various
CONTEXTUAL meanings or interpretations that the morpheme acquires in the
various circumstances of its use. Contextual meanings do not form a part of the
essential meaning carried by a form, and they vary according to its linguistic and
extra-linguistic environment. Of course, a given morpheme is always used in
some context, linguistic and extra-linguistic. And each context will engender a
particular semantic interpretation, which must not, however, be confused with
the meaning inherent in the morpheme, and common to all of its uses (cf.
Waugh 1975:439, and King 1983:113). In order to establish the formal meaning
of a morpheme, ALL of its uses must be examined, and from them a common
denominator of meaning extracted (if possible) on which the various uses are
based.
As King (1983:102) points out, many grammarians have been content to
delineate and catalogue the uses attributable to a particular form. There are,
however, a number of problems and inadequacies with this sort of approach to
semantic description (see King 1983: 103). From the perspective of the present
investigation, the major problem concerns the identification and delimitation of
these meanings. Nothing seems to prevent the proliferation of meanings as more
and more individual examples are taken into account: in this approach all
meanings are accorded equal footing. Furthermore, there is another problem for
the linguist who is not a native speaker of the language in establishing the
intended referential meaning of the utterance (or subpart thereof), and its
connotations. I have already discussed this problem in connection with the field
methodology (see section 1.10). It is clear from that discussion that the pairing
between the initial English prompts and the speaker's responses to them cannot
be regarded as unassailable 'raw' data. Even when the context constrains the
possible interpretations there may still be room for misunderstandings
(especially in the region of non-experiential meanings, which will take up a
significant part of the discussion of this chapter).
Thus the crucial problem with the cataloguing approach is that the only
means of cross-checking and assessing the presence (or absence) of a particular
sense is to elicit a native speaker's reaction and explanation. (And I have already
mentioned practical problems inherent in this methodology, at least in the field
situation where this research was conducted.) However, in the approach I amPREUMINARY REMARKS451advocating here, there is a constant interplay and exchange between the processes
of refining the specification of contextual meanings and encapsulating the formal
meanings. The complete meaning of an utterance or subpart of an utterance can
only be approached by degrees, and this may entail successive modifications to
the interpretation of particular examples, even in some cases the rejection of the
speaker's gloss as inappropriate or inaccurate. Furthermore, examples are not
seen in isolation from other like examples. Rather, by processes of crosschecking and comparison over as large a corpus as possible, significant
contextual meanings can be identified, and proliferation of meanings/uses
avoided. That is, we are more concerned with types of contextual meaning of a
form than with the instantiated and unrepealable meaning tokens in specific
utterances (cf. Ellis 1966:81).
But the establishment of formal meaning requires more than a mere
examination of contextual meanings. As a sign, a morpheme enters into
paradigmatic relations with other signs, and it is the system of such relations
that gives it linguistic 'value' (cf. Saussure 1959/1974:lllff). The formal
meaning of a morpheme cannot be fully determined without an appreciation of
the meanings of the other morphemes with which it enters into oppositions.
This means that minimal pairs and the principle of paradigmatic opposition
within fixed frames must be used in establishing formal meanings, in addition to
the process of abstraction of invariants from contextual meanings. A special case
of this is of importance to the study of a number of the forms dealt with in this
chapter. That is, the contrast between the presence and the absence of the form in
given contexts. Meaning is carried by the absence of a particular sign in a place
where it may occur, and zero in such contexts may also be regarded as a sign
belonging to the paradigmatic set including the former morpheme.
This account sets out to do more than merely assign English glosses to
Gooniyandi morphemes, which glosses are frequently misleading, and have
unintended connotations. An attempt is made to give sharp formulations (and
formalisations) of the formal meanings. This enterprise meets with varying
degrees of success and depth with the various morphemes discussed. The formal
meanings have, in a few instances, been described in terms of systems of feature
oppositions (cf. Waugh 1975, and King 1983). This has been done only for
morphemes which enter into paradigmatic sets, one member of which is
obligatorily chosen in all circumstances of a specified type- see sections 6.5.1
and 6.5.5. Elsewhere, formulae and short descriptions have been used.","[432, 433, 434, 435]"
"-Binyi PER contrasts with -yoo DAT which can also mark a thing sought
after. The dative treats it as a type of 'purpose'. On the other hand, when -binyi
PER occurs, there is never a specific entity in mind as the ultimate goal of the
action. (Consequently, something sought after is never cross-referenced by an
oblique bound pronominal in the VP - see (3-96) above; in most other
contexts moow- 'look for, seek' cross-references the thing sought.) There is no
certainty that the desired foodstuff will even be encountered. Within narrative
texts, clauses with this type of -binyi PER phrase are normally 'topical': that is,
they introduce the subject matter of the narrative in the most general way, as
concerned with a particular type of hunting. Following sentences normally
describe the details, the type of action undertaken in order to obtain the food.
When -yoo DAT occurs, there is invariably a specific (though not necessarily
definite) entity in a specific location, which is to be obtained as a result of the
action described in the clause- see examples in section 5.2.3.7.",[171]
"•
NOMINALS143It is, however, possible to distinguish some subclasses, nearly all of whichhave a limited number of members: determiners (3.3.1), kin-terms (3.3.2),
subsection terms (3.3.3), number words (3.3.4} and proper nouns (3.3.5). These
are semantically homogeneous subclasses, and they often have distinctive
distributions within the NP, and/or with respect to certain stem-forming
suffixes.
For the remainder of the nominal class I have been unable to identify
subclasses showing distinctive formal and semantic properties. The class of
nominals includes, in addition to the subclasses mentioned in the preceding
paragraph: words for concrete objects such as flora {types of plants and trees),
fauna (various animal species), humans (including sex and age specific terms),
and their parts ('root', 'tail', 'feather', 'eye', etc.); features of the weather and the
elements (including 'fire', 'water', 'rain', 'wind', etc.); topographical and
environmental features (such as 'rock', 'creek', 'hill', 'limestone', etc.); and
artefacts ('spear', 'boomerang', etc.). Also included are more abstract words for
songs, rituals, colours, shapes, sizes, feelings ('shame', 'fear', 'anger', etc.), and
just a few terms for the most common action types ('sleep', 'motion', 'travel' (or
'walkabout') and 'fight').
3.3.1 Determinersoeterminers constitute a small closed class of nominal words which normally
realise the function Deictic in the NP (see 4.L2 for a discussion of this term).
To be precise, determiners may be defined as those words which may realise the
NP roles of Deictic, Qualifier and Entity, but not the Quantifier or Classifier
roles. This formulation of the definition is necessary in order to exclude from the
class, words such as yoowarni 'one', garndiwangooddoo 'many', etc. which may
also realise the role of Deictic (but which are not determiners semantically).
Being closed, the class of determiners could be defined by listing its members;
however, it is useful to have this independent 'distributional' justification which
shows that it is not just an arbitrary collection, set up by the analyst in the
absence of good reasons.
Determiners may be assigned to one of two categories: definite and
indefinite.
3.3.1.1 Definite determinersDefinite determiners are of three types: (1) demonstratives, which point to
something in the situational context of the utterance; (2) endophors, which referTIIEWORD144to entities mentioned in the linguistic context -usually in the preceding text,
but sometimes in the following text; and (3) a non-demonstrative, nonendophoric determiner which identifies an entity which is, or need be in neither
the linguistic nor the situational context.
[1] Demonstrative determiners distinguish two degrees of distance with respect tothe speaker, proximal and distal:
Proximal:
Distal:ngirndaji
ngooddoo'this'
'that'Both of these terms are used in reference to places as well as things (although
not, it appears, in reference to times).
There is a third term, ngirnda, which also refers to an object in the
proximity of the speech situation. But it is not clear precisely how this term
differs in meaning and function from ngirndaji 'this'. In quite a number of
examples ngirnda was used in reference to something closer to the speaker than
to the hearer, particularly when the object was invisible to the hearer. For
example, it was used in reference to an object concealed in the speaker's hand
(which the hearer believed was elsewhere) (see example (6-57)); and in another
instance it occurred in a direct quote in a text, the purpose of which was to draw
the attention of the addressee to a dead body the speaker had found. To the best of
my knowledge, there are no examples in which ngirnda is used in reference to
something relatively closer to the hearer, and/or visible to the hearer and not the
speaker. The functions of the determiner ngirnda require further investigation.
[2] There are two endophoric determiners which are usually used in anaphoric
reference to a previously mentioned entity. They are:
niyaji 'this'
niyi 'that'
(Niyi 'that' is homophonous with the third person singular pronoun, but can be
distinguished from the latter on morphological, as well as functional grounds
(see section 3.6). However, it is often difficult to be certain that a particular
instance of niyi is the determiner or the pronoun.)
The difference in meaning between these two words is not perfectly clear,
but seems to be roughly as follows. Niyaji is frequently used in reference to
something which was mentioned in the immediately preceding text, often the
immediately previous clause, and which is assumed to be in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. It is frequently used in the ""reprise"" construction (see
section 5.3.2), illustrated in example (3-12) below. Niyi, on the other hand,•NO:MINALS145often 'picks up' a referent established earlier in the text, but which has not been
in the foreground for some time. For example, in a text about Pigeon (the so
called ""outlaw of the Leopolds"" -see 1.6 above), reference is made to an
Aboriginal police tracker by the phrase niyi-ngga yoowooloo-ngga Roebourne
Mick-ngga (that-ERG man-ERG Roebourne Mick-ERG) 'by that man
Roebourne Mick'. This person, who had been introduced ten clauses earlier, had
played no significant role in the events described in the eight intermediate
clauses. (See also line (42) of Text 1.) However niyi is sometimes used in
reference to an entity fore grounded in a text, or one which may be assumed to be
in the forefront of the hearer's consciousness. In this case it has an emphatic or
contrastive effect- see for example (6-30) below, and line (81) of Text 1. The
difference between the two terms thus seems likely to lie in the relative
prominence they give to the referent item, rather than in the proximity of the
anaphor within the text.
In addition to referring to previously mentioned things, the two determiners
niyaji 'this' and niyi 'that' are used in making reference to portions of text of size
larger than phrases - that is, to situations, and not just entities. For instance,
in
(3-ll) garingi ngangjayi
niyaji wila
wife
he:might:have:given:him this
OK
'Had he given him (his daughter) as a wife, it would have been OK.'niyaji 'this' refers to the whole clause garingi ngangjayi 'he might have given
him a wife'. More accurately, it refers to a FACT (Halliday 1985:227), the
situation referred to by the clause (see 5.2.1), rather than the actual wording of
the clause. But the section of text may be larger than a clause. For example,
niyinhingi (that-ABL) and niyaji-nhingi (this-ABL) are used as sentential
connectives, with the approximate meaning 'then, after that', where the thing
referred to is either a single event (referred to by a sentence), or an episode
(referred to by a larger stretch of text. (fhere appear to be individual preferences,
some speakers preferring and almost always using niyinhingi 'after that'; others
prefer niyajinhingi 'after this'.) None of the other definite determiners may be
used in this way: they always refer to material entities or places.
[3] The determiner ginharndi, which is normally glossed 'you know' or 'that one,
you know' by speakers, refers to something which is neither in the immediate
speech situation, nor mentioned in the surrounding text. It indicates that, in the
speaker's estimation, the hearer is able to identify the entity being referred to, it
being known to him or her. The fact that it is explicitly stated as being shared1461HEWORDknowledge is the only clue that is given to the hearer to help him/her identify it.
(I'he neighbouring Jaru language also has a determiner jangu with a very similar
meaning- Tsunoda 1981:63.)
The two most frequent uses of ginharndi in my corpus are (i) in reference
to individuals with whom both my Gooniyandi teacher and I myself had shared
some experience (e.g. a visit), and (ii) in reference to individuals spoken about in
previous conversations. For example, {3-12) illustrates the first usage:
(3-12) ngooddoo -ngga NPfginharndi goomboo]NP wardgilayi
that
ERG
you:know woman
she:had:gone
-ngangi moolooddja -yidda niyaji -ngga barnnginaddi
with:us Mulunja
ALL this
ERG she:retumed:me
gaddwaroo
afternoon
'The woman who went to Mulurrja with us brought me back
yesterday.'
It should be noted that ginharndi is not a definite article, and has a range of
uses quite distinct from the English article the. Ginharndi marks the referent of
an NP as identifiable, and so definite; but only a small subset of definite NPs
may be so marked. As distinct from the English definite article, ginharndi
indicates a specific characteristic by which the referent may be identified: it must
belong to the register of entities known, but not present in the linguistic or nonlinguistic situation. (Compare Halliday and Hasan 1976:71.)
3.3.1.2 Indefinite determinersThere are three indefinite determiners, which indicate that the identity of the
referent of the NP is not known to the speaker. They frequently carry the added
nuance of requesting this information from the hearer: that is, they are often used
with interrogative effect (cf. Dixon 1972:182ff). However, it is clear that this
interrogative sense is not a part of the fonnal meaning of the words (section
6.1), but is engendered or suggested by the context of its occurrence (see also
sections 5.4 and 5.3.1 below). This follows from the fact that there are contexts
of occurrence of these determiners (namely when they occur with the enclitics
-ngaddaya 'also, too' (section 6.3.5) and -widdi 'identity unknown' (section
6.3.6)), which do not admit interrogative interpretations. The three indefinite
determiners are:•NOMlNAI.Sngoorndoo

jaji147'someone, who'

'Someone broke it,' or 'Who broke it?'","[127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"•----------POSTPOSIDONS187(c) the handedness of a person, as in waroogoo-binyi (left-PER) 'left
handed'; in this use, -binyi would appear to fulfil a stem forming function.
On one occasion only, -binyi PER was followed by the ERG postposition
- on repetition of the example, the ERG was omitted. The example was:
(3-97) balyoowa -binyi -ngga gilbawidi
thinga
behind
PER ERG they:found:him foot
They found his footprints from behind.'
An explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear.3.7.2.9 -ngaddi COMITative-ngaddi COMIT marks:
(a) nominal phrases fulfilling the clausal role of Means - see section
5.2.3.3. (In transitive and reflexive/reciprocal clauses, as we have already seem,
-ngaddi COMIT is followed by -ngga ERG.
(b) nominal phrases in the Accompaniment role, when the accompanying
and the accompanied entities are of unequal status- see section 5.2.3.5.
(c) something in close association with an entity, such as a possession.
The possession may be either alienable (example (4-78)) or inalienable (example
(3-98)).
(3-98) ngaragnga goornboo gamoo -ngaddi
he:made:it woman
breast COMIT
'He painted a woman with breasts.'
As examples (4-78) and (3-98) demonstrate, this sense arises when the
-ngaddi PP fulfils a role in a phrase. It also occurs when the comitative PP
functions as Attribute in a characterising clause - see section 5.2.1.1.1.2.
There is, however, as has already been mentioned, no reason to regard nominals
marked with -ngaddi COMITas derived adjectives (cf. Dixon 1980:324-325).
Finally, there are a few apparently irregular uses of -ngaddi COMIT, in
which this postposition seems to function as a stem forming suffix:
yoowarningaddi (one-COMIT) 'once', ngirndangaddi (this-COMIT) 'this way',
ngirndangaddingga (this-COMIT-ERG) 'this side'. ngooddoongaddingga (thatCOMIT-ERG) 'that side', yinigangaddi (somehow-COMIT) 'by some means, by
what means'. There are also half a dozen or so mother-in-law avoidance
nominals, including bin.gidi-ngaddi (feather-COMIT) 'bird' and wanya-ngaddi
(emu feather-COMIT) 'emu', which are analysable as ordinary nominal plus the188THE WORDcomitative postposition.3.7.2.10 -winyja DEPrivative
The postposition -winyja DEP is quite infrequent in occurrence, and seems to be
used in only one function. That is, to indicate something - always a thing,
never a process - the lack of which causes an event to occur; see section
5.2.3.6 and examples (5-159) and (5-160).
It should be noted that Gooniyandi has no bound morpheme, either suffix
or postposition, that functions as a regular privative marker. Instead, to express
this meaning, the negative particle marlami 'nothing, without' is used following
(usually) the nominal referring to the thing lacked. The contrast between these
two expressions, NP-winyja, and [N mar/ami], is that the former has the
additional semantic component, absent from the latter, that the lack of the thing
is the cause of the process. In keeping with this, only the latter occurs in
relational clauses expressing 'x has no y'.3.7.2.11 -yooddoo - -yiddi DUal and -yarndi PLural
These two postpositions, -yooddoo- -yiddi DU and -yarndi PL, optionally mark
the number of an NP as either dual or plural (three or more) respectively. As yet
it is not clear what factors motivate the occurrence or non-occurrence of these
morphemes on non-singular NPs. (A likely hypothesis is that they are used: (i)
in initial specification of number, and otherwise (ii) to help keep reference clear,
for instance when a text involves two (or more) groups of items which would be
referred to by the same nominal, but which consist of different numbers of these
items. But this hypothesis has not been tested by extensive textual
investigation.) Examples of usage include (4-77), (4-86), (4-95), (4-96), and
lines (5), (21) and (61) of Text 1, and line (6) of Text 2.
3.8 EncliticsUnlike postpositions and stem forming suffixes, enclitics do not form, together
with the units to which they are attached, other grammatical units of the same
rank as those to which they are attached. Therefore, enclitics do not allow for
recursive embedding, such as is possible to a limited extent with postpositions
and stem forming suffixes.
The following are the main enclitics:•
ENCUTICS-moowa
-nyooloo
-ngaddaya
-widdi
-jangi-rni
-mi- -ma
-nyali
-woo189'only' (ON)
'etcetera' (ETC)
'else, too' (TOO)
'identity unknown' (UNKN)
'like' (SEM)
'next, now' (SEQ)
'indefinite, question' (IND)
'repetition, again' (REP)
'definite' (DEF)The glosses given above should not be taken seriously; they are meant to be no
more than suggestive. For a detailed discussion of the meanings of these
morphemes, see section 6.3 below.
The enclitic -jangi SEM is exceptional in that it sometimes forms a g-unit with
the constituent to which it is attached - see for instance, examples (6-95) and
(6-96) below. The fact that it does not ALWAYS form such a unit justifies its
classification as an enclitic. This does, however, necessitate a slight modification
to the definition given in the first paragraph of this section: enclitics are
morphemes which do not necessarily form g-units with the units to which they are
attached. (Postpositions and stem forming suffixes always do.)The enclitics show very little allomorphy - which is partly because none
of the initial consonants are affected by rules discussed in section 2.4. The
indefinite enclitic is the only one showing altemant forms. Its allomorphs -rna
and -mi are chosen depending on the class of the item to which they are attached:
-ma if it is verbal, -mi otherwise.
Two subsets may be distinguished: the first, consisting of the six
morphemes -moowa ON, -nyooloo ETC, -ngaddaya TOO, -widdi UNKN, -jangi
SEM and -rni SEQ from the list above, may be attached to non-verbal units
only, while the remaining three occur with all classes of units, verbal and nonverbal. When attached to non-verbal items, enclitics typically occur in final
position, following all other bound morphemes. But in the VP, -rna IND and
-nyali REP occur medially, in order class (3), labeled Mood in formula F1 on
page 192 below; that is, it follows the first grammatical word of the VP. -Woo
DEF, by contrast, follows the CC word and occurs in position (5), labeled Mode
in Fl. Placement of the enclitics is not arbitrary, but correlates with the 'scope'
and 'focus' of the enclitic (see section 6.3).
Sequences of enclitics do occur, though too infrequently to permit firm
generalisations to be made at this stage; I suspect (but cannot demonstrate) that
their order is meaningful. The only sequence that is at all common is190'IHEWORD-jangi-nyali SEM-REP 'just/exactly like', as in minyawoo-jangi-nyali (cat-SEMREP) 'just like a cat'.
3.9 The verb phrase
In this section I discuss the structure of the 'verb' - that distributional word and
grammatical phmse which realises the clausal role of Process.
3.9.1 Verbals
Verbals have already been def""med as those lexical (open-class) words which are
bound; all other lexical words have the privilege of free occurrence. Verbals have
just two contexts of occurrence: they occur either as constituents of finite VPs,
or as non-finite verbs. Although words of other classes may occur in the first
context, only verballexemes occur in the second. Furthennore, every verbal may
occur within a non-finite 'purposive' clause, in which construction it is followed
by the -woo allomorph of the dative postposition (see page 174 above)- e.g.
ward-goo (go-D AT) 'for going', bayal-woo (swim-DAT) 'for swimming'.
Another distinctive property of verbals is, as we have already seen, that, as a
class, they show phonotactic differences from the words of other lexical classes:
final consonants are permitted and frequent (section 2.2.5); there are statistically
significant differences in distribution of initial consonants in verbals compared
with other classes (section 2.2.5); and there is a high frequency of (closed)
monosyllables (section 2.3.1).
I have been unable to distinguish subclasses within the class of verbals. In
particular, it is not possible to distinguish disjoint classes of transitive and
intransitive verbals (cf. Dixon 1980:378). Whereas in many Australian
languages transitivity may be regarded as a lexical feature of verbs (Dixon
1980:278), in Gooniyandi transitivity has a clausal locus, and a single verbal
lexeme may occur in clauses of more than one transitivity type. Choice of
classifier may go some way towards distinguishing the transitivity of a VP for example, ward-ji (go-PAST/(3sg)N+I) 'he went' vs. ward-nga (goPAST/(3sg)N+A) 'he took it'. However, it proves equally impossible to
distinguish transitivity classes at phrase level as at word level (see sections
5.2.1.3 and 6.5.5 below).
Verbals in Gooniyandi constitute a large open class of lexemes which refer
to all sorts of processes, including: states (e.g. wara- 'stand', bagi- 'lie'); changes
of state (e.g. nang- 'die'); motion, including induced motion (e.g. ward- 'go,
walk, bring'); violent actions (such as gard- 'hit, fell', bananggadd- 'snatch');THE VERB PHRASE191perception and mental processes (e.g. danymili- 'hear, listen'. mila- 'see, look');
communication (for examplejangi- 'answer',jag- 'tell'); and so on.
3.9.2 The non-finite verb
Within non-finite clauses, which are always embedded in some other unit
(section 5.5), there occurs a semantically impoverished verbal construction
which consists of either a bare verbal stem, or of a verbal stem followed by an
infinitive, either -bari (section 5.5.3.1) or -mawoo (section 5.5.3.2). As a
constituent of a clause, the non-finite verbal construction ought to be of phrase
level. However, since the only way in which a verbal root may be expanded is
by the addition of a (verbal) stem forming suffix (see section 3.12.2.1), or by
the addition of an infinitive, there seems to be little independent reason to regard
the construction as a phrase, and as a consequence, I do not make this
assumption. In contrast with the finite VP, the non-finite verb carries very little
information about the process: no reference is made to the participants involved
in it, temporal and modal distinctions are not made, and the semantic type of the
process is not indicated.
When there is no infinitive, the verbal stem, being a bound form, must be
followed by another morpheme, either a postposition or a nominal stem forming
suffix (see 3.12.1.1 below), depending on whether the non-finite clause is
embedded under a PP node or under a word node. (Postpositions and stem
forming suffixes, as distinct from infinitives, are not constituents of the nonfinite verb, as will be shown below, in section 5.5.) Infinitival constructions are
usually found in non-finite clauses attributing on participant roles (section 5.2)
in the finite clauses in which they (the non-finite clauses) are embedded. In the
present data, -ngga ERG is the only postposition that ever follows an infinitive.
(Further fieldwork may uncover other combinations.)
3.9.3 The finite verb phrase
Finite VPs occur in non-embedded ""situation"" type clauses (see section 5.2.1),
in which they realise the role of Process. A finite VP consists of two obligatory
constituents, a lexical 'head' referring to the process, and a classifier complex
(CC), which indicates the person and number of the main participants in the
process (see 5.2.1.3 below), tense, and the type of process it is (in terms of the
features described in section 6.5.5 below). In addition to these two obligatory
constituents there are a number of optional elements carrying aspectual, modal
and other qualification of the process. A schematic representation of the VP isTHE WORD192
given in the following formula:F1 Process-(Aspect)-(Mood)-CC-(Mode)-(Oblique pronominal)-(Number)
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
where brackets enclose optional elements.
As was claimed earlier, this unit is a singled-word of phrasal rank; it is
not an inflectional form of the Process lexeme. Its two obligatory constituents
are g-words. The' remaining, optional constituents are enclitics to these words.
That is, these optional constituents do not form g-words with the obligatory
constituents. There is no evidence, for example, that Process plus Aspect is an
inflectional form of the lexical root filling the role of Process, or that the two
together form a distinct stem. In the absence of such evidence, I make the
weakest assumption, that the aspect markers etc. are constituents of the verb
phrase.
A finite VP may consist of between two and four (perhaps five at the
most) phonological words (as defined in section 2.5.1). The two grammatical
words, the item realising the role of Process, and the CC, are usually distinct
phonological words; but, as mentioned earlier (see pages 128 and 135), the
boundary of the phonological word may move forwards, and so not coincide with
the grammatical boundary. Monosyllabic enclitics are, with one exception,
unstressed and cohere with the preceding phonological word. The exception is
the bound oblique pronominal enclitic -nhi 'to him/her/it', which takes stress.
Enclitic morphemes of two or more syllables are usually phonological words,
and are stressed on their initial syllable. There are just a few exceptions without
initial stress, all of which have an initial {w}, which is affected by VR6: {wila}
FACT (see below 3.9.3.4); the allomorph {wanhi} of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic (see section 3.9.3.6); and the allomorph ( waddi} of
the paucal number enclitic (see section 3.9.3.7).
It appears that (3) (Mood) and (5) (Mode) in Fl are in complementary
distribution; otherwise there are examples displaying choices from all other
combinations of categories. Some examples (written phonemically) are:
(1)
(3-99) gaddig(2)
(4)
- goowa - wingiabsent
PROG
'I could be away.'","[171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"Not only is the choice of allomorph conditioned by neighbouring
morphemes, but the order of the two pronominal prefixes is conditioned by their
relative status on a nominal hierarchy (cf. Silverstein 1976b, Heath 1976). Two
hierarchies explain the order of these pronominals:
Hl
H2first> second > third
ACC>NOMHere the symbol'>' indicates 'is ranked higher than'. and in the present context
indicates also morpheme order - i.e. > may also be interpreted as 'precedes'.
The second hierarchy, H2, of course, applies only if the first fails to order the
pronominals -which happens when both are third person.
Eight forms from Tables 3-9A and 3-9C still remain to be accounted for;
these have both a first and a second person actant.
Four of these can be dealt with fairly easily under the assumption of a
person-neutralising rule which has the effect of neutralising the person of the
lower ranking pronominal on Hl in case it is also outranked on H2. In other
words, if x acts on y and x is outranked by y in terms of person, only the
number of x is indicated, by the appropriate third person pronominal. This is
really only a complicated way of saying that, when second person acts on first
person, the number only of the second person is indicated by the corresponding
third person form. (In case the Agent is third person, neutralisation has, of
course, no effect.)THE VERB PHRASE211The four remaining forms have a first person Agent acting on a second
person Goal. By analogy with the foregoing, the following segmentation is
suggested:
{a)
(b)
(c)
(d)(Isg)-7(2sg):
(lsg)-7(2pl):
(1R)-7(2sg):
{1R)-7(2pl):+ng+iny+
+ng+nggidd+iny+
+jidd+iny+
+jidd+iny+bidd+ ribi(dd)This proposal involves the identification of allomorphs +ng+ of the first
person singular NOM and +iny+ of the second person singular ACC (the Iauer
involves a final nasal of the same point of articulation as the (initial) consonant
of the corresponding NOM pronominal prefix). It would seem reasonable to
assume that the posited underlying geminate ng-ng of (b) would be reduced to
the single ng (geminate nasals do occur in the language, but not preceding
stops).
However, (b) poses a second problem in that the ACC form of the second
plural does not occur; instead, there is the sequence of the second plural NOM
+nggidd+ followed by the second singular ACC +iny+. A similar problem
arises in relation to (d), where instead of the (2pl)A prefix, there occurs the
(2sg)A, the number being discontinuously marked by a (3pl)A form in final
position. But note that the choice of allomorphs of (3pl)A- +ri+ vs. +bidd+
-differs slightly from the choice elsewhere: +ri+ occurs with +A, +ADDI and
+ARNI 1; +bi+ with +MI and +BINI; and +bidd+ with +DI. I do not attempt to
explain the two exceptional forms (b) and (d); the proposed segmentation does,
however, appear to be reasonable.
. Comparison of Table 3-8 with Table 3-10 shows that there is a good deal
of similarity between the pronominals that occur in monovalent complexes and
the NOM form of the pronominals occurring in bivalent complexes. The only
difference is that the second person singular set 1 form +ngg+ of Table 3-8 does
not appear in Table 3-10; its closest relative on the latter table is the accusative
form +nggi+. (Note: the first person singular +ng+ is not shown in Table 3-10,
but it has been subsequently discussed.) The evidence seems to justify regarding
the forms shown in Table 3-7 as NOM forms of the pronominal prefixes. For
convenience, all postulated forms are tabulated below in Table 3-11.","[195, 196]"
"Thirdly, the expression class which realises the role of Attribute differs
somewhat depending on whether the clause is verbal or verbless. There are
principled tendencies relating the type of attribute to one or the other clause type
as the most common mode of expression. In general, the more 'concrete' and
'alienable' an Attribute is, the more it can be construed as an aspect of the mode
of being of the Carrier, and the more likely it is that the attributing clause will
be verbal. For example, locative and associative circumstantial Attributes, are
quite concrete and alienable, and they usually occur in situation clauses. On the
other hand, if the quality is so inherent as to be inseparable from an entity, it is
unlikely to contribute to the mode of being of the entity. Thus qualities such as
colour, size, and shape are infrequent as Attributes in situation clauses (they
occur only when there has been a change in that quality). Likewise when the
Attribute is another entity which is related to the Carrier either as a more
abstract type of 'circumstance', such as purpose, source/origin, comparison, or
possession- clearly such Attributes cannot affect the mode of being of the
Carrier in any significant way. and are never (to the best of my knowledge)
found in Attributive being clauses. In between these limits there are a number of
descriptive Attributes of qualities which are neither inalienable, nor extrinsic to
the object. These are the ones which commonly occur in both situation and
relational clauses. If, on the other hand, we consider Attributes in terms of their
characterising potential, exactly the same pattern emerges: locational, extent, and312THE CLAUSEassociative circumstances characterise an entity least, while inner defining
qualities and extrinsic uses, likenesses, etc. characterise an entity most, leaving
the same residue of more accidental alienable qualities.
These criteria justify my claim that the verbs of stance do not function as
mere copulas, but as Processes in a distinct clause type, which refers to a mode
of being.
It is possible to distinguish the following types of clauses of being:
(1) intensive
(2) circumstantial
(a) locative
(b) extent
(c) associative
All of these have an inherent Attribute and an inherent Carrier. As has already
been mentioned, there are no processes of being corresponding to identifying
clauses. These types will be dealt with in order below. We will now describe the
five subtypes of Attributive being clauses.
[1] Intensive. All that needs to be added regarding this type is that it allows
two other verballexemes to realise the Process in addition to the three verbs of
posture (and this adds further support to my claim that the verb carries
significant semantic content). The verb ward- 'go' may occur when motion is the
typical characteristic of the Carrier associated with its possession of the
Attribute. For example, stockmen typically move about in the course of their
work:(5-46) stockman -loondinow niyaji -nhingi nganyi
!:became then this
ABL
I
stockman wardngi
I went
'I became a stockman then; after that I was a stockman.'","[295, 296]"
"11:of occurrence of an ERG PP in a transitive clause in which there could be no
possibility of confusion as to the identity of the ""subject"" and ""object"".
Furthermore, realisation of this participant role by an ERG PP is much more
frequent in texts than in formally elicited material (where its use is comparatively
rare). A preliminary investigation of half a dozen texts (all narratives in the first
and third persons) showed that the relevant participant role was realised by an
ERG PP in fifty cases, and by an NP in ten cases, in transitive, middle and
reflexive/reciprocal clauses. (The small number of cases is due to the fact that the
participant role was normally ellipsed - see remark (3) below.) In only a handful
of the fifty cases of PP realisation could there have been any reasonable
possibility of ambiguity had an NP occurred instead.
These facts strongly suggest that the presence of the postposition plays
some role in the text, possibly giving some sort of salience to the constituent to
which it is added, and may have something to do with foregrounding of the whole
clause in which it occurs within the text. It has been suggested by Hopper and
Thompson (1980:294-295) that foregrounding is associated with high
transitivity, backgrounding with low transitivity. It may be reasonable to see the
clausal variants in which realisation by an NP occurs as ""less transitive"" than
those in which realisation by an ERG PP occurs. For the moment, however, this
remains only a possible issue for future research. I think it likely that there are a
number of factors pertinent to the occurrence or not of the postposition. I
propose to ignore this complication in the remainder of the discussion. The
option ERG PP or NP will be assumed to lie outside the system of clausal
transitivity: i.e. the NP and PP will be assumed to be alternate realisations of a
single role.",[304]

"THE ClAUSE362Not every pause signifies the end of a tone unit, however. There may be pauses
in which the speaker is collecting his/her thoughts, which are followed by
material identified as being from the same tone unit, on the grounds that pitch is
relatively constant before and after the pause. Occasionally, too, two tone units
will occur in succession, with no intervening pause. For examples of tone units
see the texts in Appendix 1.
The tone units into which a text is divided typically do not correspond to
grammatical divisions into clauses or sentences. Quite often a single NP is
uttered in isolation, in a tone unit of its own, separate from the other
constituents of the clause to which it belongs. And the remaining constituents,
which need not correspond to any grammatical division of the clause, may fall
into a single tone unit. However, tone units are not distributed randomly across
the clauses of a text. As a rule, a clause consists of an integral number usually between one and five - of tone units, each of which contains an
integral number of clausal ICs. Tone units do not normally consist of parts of
two clauses, or parts of two phrases (unless they are discontinuous). Most
frequently, a clause will fall into either one or two tone units as illustrated in
example (5-206). Although maximal division as in (5-207) is possible, it israre.
(5-206) ned colin -ngga I lajangangadda
yawarda I
ERG
he:rode:it:for:me horse
'Ned Colins, he rode my horse for me.'
(5-207) garndiwidditwongidi yoowooloo -yooddoo I barajjiddayi I
we
man
DU
we:followed:itthinga Ifoot
'We two men followed the footprints.'
Rarely, a single tone unit consists of two full clauses.
This raises the question: If tone units don't correspond to grammatical
units, what do they represent? The answer proposed here is that tone units
represent the INFORMATION UNITS into which the speaker opts to divide his or
her utterance. Precisely this suggestion has been made by Halliday (1970) for
English, and subsequently by Kilham (1977) and Heath (1984) for the (unrelated)
Australian languages Wile Munkan and Nunggubuyu respectively. (See also
Grimes 1975.}
I am suggesting that tone units delimit information units into which the
speaker packages his message, each tone unit corresponding to a unit ofTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE363information, the amount of information s/he thinks the hearer can take in at one
time. Thus, Gooniyandi texts consist of sequences of units each of which carries
one ""piece"" or quantum of information. This raises the important but often
ignored question: What is information? Halliday (1985) has suggested that
""information ... is a process of interaction between what is already known or
predictable and what is new or unpredictable"". There are two problems with this
formulation. The first is that information units sometimes relate things which
are both new; the second is that it is not explained what types of things may be
associated together in this way.
A rather different view of the nature of information is held by writers such
as Fronek (1983), who claim that information can be presented only through
propositional structures, which means that information is a nexus between a
predicate and its arguments. Both Halliday and Fronek agree on one thing: that
information involves some son of nexus. It appears that this nexus may be of
one of the following three types:
(a) A propositional nexus, that is, the connection between a full predicate
and its arguments, expressed in a clause.
(b) An association between two entities, or an entity and an attribute.
(5-208) illustrates this:
(5-208) gamba joomoo laandi
up
water soakbagiri I ngaddanggaminhingi
it:liesfrom:dreamtimegamba/
water
'There's a soak up there, one with dreamtime associations.'
In the second information unit of this example, only a part of the nexus finds
linguistic expression; the other part occurs in the preceding unit. This
information COULD have been expressed clausally in a single tone unit - but
there is no reason to believe that the second information unit of this example is
an (elliptical) clause.
(c) An association between a linguistic constituent or its referent, and a
clausal or phrasal role. For instance, in (5-206), the first information unit
associated the person Ned Collins with the role of Agent, the rider of the horse.
Alternatively, and/or concurrently, the associated role may be the textual one of
theme.
The rate of injection of information in a text depends mainly on the
speaker's evaluation of how quickly the hearer can take it in - which is
presumably based on considerations of presumed familiarity with the subject364THE CLAUSEmatter, degree of interest in the subject matter, intelligence, etc. - and is
controlled by its division into information units (see Grimes 1975:297). It is
inversely proportional to the number of information units into which the text is
divided. (5-207) shows a very slow rate of information injection; it is much
quicker in (5-209), where the speaker is presenting an affectively loaded part of
the discourse, the point at which he finds a lost man.(5-209) nganyi joodoo -nyali wardngi niyi gilbali I
I
straight REP I:went him I:found:him
'I went straight up and found him.'
The rate of information delivery can be slowed right down by dividing a
particular message into two clauses and two information units. The first unit
will state the matter in its starkest terms, and this will be elaborated on in the
following unit. In this way, not only is the rate of information flow controlled,
but each aspect can be made prominent in a 'natural' way - that is, may be
made the unmarked Focus of information (see below) - without overloading
any message unit.(5-210) niyaji ralwiddayi I
boonbooloo ralwiddayi I
this they:two:plucked:it feather
they:two:plucked:it
They plucked it; they plucked its feathers.'
When a given clause consists of two or more tone/information units, it is
typically the case that one of the units can be identified as more central or
PRIMARY than the other unit(s), which will be referred to as SECONDARY
unit(s). The primary unit has a more prominent salient syllable, and an
intonation contour characterised by greater pitch movement. On the other hand, a
secondary unit normally has a slight rise in pitch on its final syllable when it
precedes the primary unit, but a low falling pitch contour (i.e. with a low initial
pitch) when it follows the primary. No matter what its position, the primary
unit does not have the slight rise of the type associated with an initial secondary.
I have attempted to show these features in examples (5-211) and (5-212)(=(5-208).","[345, 346, 347, 348]"

unstressed vowelPhonetic transcriptions use IPA symbols as far as possible. The main
exception is that a dot under a vowel is used to indicate retroflection, and a dot
under the symbol/ indicates the retroflex lateral. Elsewhere, Gooniyandi words
are represented in a practical orthography, which is described in section 1.8.
Words in other languages are written according to the accepted or recommended
orthography for that language if there is one, and otherwise according to the
spelling in the source.
Verbal classifiers arc cited throughout the text in capitals (e.g. +BINDI),
and are not usually glossed. Pronominal prefixes to the classifier are glossed asXXABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONSfollows: the person and number information is enclosed in brackets, and is
followed by a letter referring to the case form. Thus, (IR)N indicates the
nominative form of the first person restricted.
Function labels are given with an initial capital letter.
Example sentences normally consist of three parts: (a) Gooniyandi text; (b)
interlinear gloss; and (c) free translation.
(a) The Gooniyandi text is divided into distributional words, bounded by
spaces. Morpheme boundaries are not necessarily indicated, except for the
morphemes under discussion, or where relevant to the discussion. The first Jines
of example sentences are not punctuated. However, where relevant, suprasegmental features (e.g. tone units, salience, etc.) are indicated. Bolding indicates
that a syllable is salient.
(b) Interlinear glosses are unit by unit, each full unit distinguished in the
Gooniyandi line being glossed. Where more than one English word is required
for the gloss of a unit, the words are separated by a colon (:). For typographic
convenience, 'he' is used in the glosses instead of the more cumbersome 'he, she,
or it' (Gooniyandi does not make gender distinctions in its nominals and
pronominals).
(c) A free translation is given for each example. This is enclosed in quotes:
double quotes for translations provided by the speaker himself/herself, and single
quotes otherwise.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"
"THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION301might thus be regarded as fractured NPs (see section 4.2 above).
The lack of contrast between phrase and clause at the level of form has led some
linguists to suggest that verbless clauses in other Australian languages resembling
Gooniyandi consist of just single NPs - see e.g. (Dixon 1972:71). There are a
number of reasons against this hypothesis as regards Gooniyandi. Firstly,
propositional modifiers (which include markers of negation, probability, and so
on - see section 5.4.1) mark the nexus between the two constituents by their
position:
(5-18) ngirndaji gili
mangaddi binyidi
this
same not
hard
'This is not hard (ground).'
Secondly, reversal of the order of the two joined constituents does not have a
semantic effect identical with that of reordering the constituents of the
corresponding NP. And thirdly, only the Attribute, and not the whole
characterising clause may realise the function of Process in a clause.",[285]
"(6-118) A: jaji
goowajgila
something I:call:him
B: mangaddi niyi girli joowooddoo gandiyangi

you:will:call:him
A: 'What do I call him?'
B: 'No(thing). He'sjoowooddoo; you call him brother-in-law.'
It remains unclear just what sense mangaddi 'not' conveys here. In both
circumstances outlined above, mar/ami 'nothing, without' (see discussion of next
section) occurs far more frequently than does mangaddi 'not'.
6.4.2 marlami 'nothing, without'
Gooniyandi has another word for expressing negation, mar/ami 'nothing,
without', which indicates that no entity, time, or place is involved in the referent
situation. It corresponds to the English words 'no', 'nothing'. 'nowhere', and
'never', and is frequently glossed najing (from standard English nothing) in
Pidgin English and Kriol. As distinct from mangaddi 'not', mar/ami 'nothing,
without' never functions as a Propositional Modifier. Rather, it negates an entity
or circumstance, and from this the clause itself may gain negative force, as
happens with the English words nothing, nowhere, and so on.
Mar/ami 'nothing, without' has three main contexts of occurrence, which
are not always distinguishable: (i) it may realise a phrasal role; (ii) it may realise
a clausal circumstantial role of time or place; or (iii) it may be used as an
interjection.
(i) I will first deal with the case in which mar/ami 'nothing, without'
fulfils a modifying role in an NP. There are two main possibilities: it may
precede or follow the Entity nominal. The relative order is significant, and finds
clearest explanation in terms of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent
modification and reference modification, discussed above (see page 267). In
addition, the phrase in which it occurs may function either attributively, within
another phrase (i.e. as a Qualifier or Classifier) or clause, or referentially.
In the first case, the phrase attributes of an entity the property of being
without something, as discussed in section 5.2.3.5 above. The usual word order
is for mar/ami 'nothing, without' to follow the Entity nominal, as exemplified
in e.g. (4-36) and (4-79). Only rarely does it precede the Entity nominal, as in
(6-119) nginyji binaddi nganyi marlami
you
know I
not
'(As) you know, I have no car.'moodiga
motorcarIn referential phrases marlami 'nothing, without' typically precedes theCLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBJALS491Entity, and indicates that nothing of the type referred to by the Entity nominal
was involved in the referent situation. In this circumstance marlami 'nothing,
without' clearly modifies the reference of the phrase. For example,
(6-120) mar/ami gamba ngambiddi baali -ya
not
water again
road LOC
'There's no water again on the road.'
(6-121) marlami banda doowwidtkl
not
ground they:got:it
'They got no dirt.'
Note: (6-120) and (6-121) may be contrasted with sentences such as (5-258) and
(5-259) in which mangaddi 'not' occurs in the same place in the clause. There is a
sharp distinction in meaning. With marlami 'nothing, without'. there is no focus
on the following element, and no presupposition that the predicate holds true of
anything (although it may).","[473, 474, 475]"

+contmuantIt is necessary to order certain of these rules with respect to certain others.
For example, as has already been mentioned, CCR3 must precede CCR4, and
CCR5 must precede CCR6. It would seem reasonable to assume that external
sandhi rules are ordered so as to follow the rules of internal sandhi. However, it
turns out that to do this would necessitate the use of diacritics, in order to
distinguish identical segments deriving from different sources - see page 118
below. It is possible to avoid their use by ordering some external sandhi rules
before certain of the internal sandhi rules, and so I have chosen this course.
The following diagram indicates in a lattice the ordering relationsPHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY116applicable to the above rules. Rules that are ordered with respect to one another
are joined by lines, the higher rule preceding the lower one; otherwise, is
assumed that the rules apply at once, whenever their environments arc met. This
assumption obviates the need to mutually order rules such as VR2 and VR6, the
former of which ""feeds"" the latter. It must be pointed out, however, that the
order indicated is only one of a number of possible ways of accounting for the
facts: it is partly determined by, and partly determines the exact formulation of
the rules.
Figure 2-7: Rule ordering
CCR3CCR9VR7'CCR5VR3VR6
R8c<i~
VR5R7CCR13
Ordering of CCR3 before CCR4; CCR5 before CCR6; VR7' before
CCR16; CCR16 before R9; and VR6 before VR5 have already been dealt with.
CCR8 and CCRIO, CCR12 arc disjunctively ordered, the latter two applying
only if the former has not. (Clearly CCRlO and CCR12 could be formalised in
such a way as to apply simultaneously with CCR8; both alternatives are equally
simple.) It is not necessary to order any of these three rules (CCR8, CCRlO,
and CCR12) with respect to VR3, which also effects the consonant {j}, since
their environments of application are completely disjoint.
It is necessary for CCR5 to precede CCR14, in order that the vowel
sequence resulting from the application of CCR5 be reduced. CCR5 has been
ordered before CCR13 in order to explain forms such as /ngangba/ 'you'll give
him it' (see derivation on page 106 above). Unfortunately, this ordering leavesSANDID117forms such as /balawi/ 'he'll send it' (which ought to derive from {bala-wi+da1 })
unexplained and irregular; the reverse order would leave /ngangba/ irregular.
However, it is most natural to order the rules with CCR13 following CCRS.
This is because CCRS must precede CCR14, which in turn must precede
CCR13 (see next paragraph).
The above ordering of CCRI4, CCRII and CCRI3 is necessary in order
to prevent the loss of /ng/ in the first person singular future of certain
classifiers. For example,
'I'll go'
{wam -bi
+ng
+ad ~ {wardbingad
go
FUT +(lsg)N +I
~ {ward-bingi} [by CCRI3 can't apply]
~ /wardbingi/CCRll(Had CCR13 been ordered before CCR14, it would give the elsewhere realisation
/a/ of {ad. resulting in the non-occurring /wardbinga/.)
CCR9 must precede CCR16 since {i} vowels assimilate to a following
fool which arises from CCR9; /gardjawinggoondoomi/ 'they might hit you (pl)'
(see page 107) is an example of this. Since the {i} deriving from the sequence
{i+ngi} by CCRll undergoes harmony with a following {oo}. whereas the {i}
deriving from {iji} or {ijoo} by CCRIO does not, CCRll has been ordered to
precede CCR16, and CCRIO has been ordered to follow CCR16.
Of the rules resulting in syllable fusion, CCR9 and CCR12 precede the
rule of external sandhi VR6, whilst CCRIO and CCRll are not necessarily
ordered with respect to it. This is for the following reasons:
(a) CCR9 and CCR12 need to precede VR6 because otherwise VR6 would have
the unwanted effect of deleting the {w} of the present tense {wi} (which bears no
stress) in the forms {mila-wi+bidd+a} 'they see him', and {mila-wi+jadd+a} 'we
see him'. /w/ is, however, present in the actual forms /milawoodda/ and
/milawadda/. The following derivations show that the order given in the list
gives the correct results:
{mila
see-wi
+bidd
+a} ~ {mila-woodda} [by CCR9] 'they see him'
PRES +(3pl)N +A
~ /milawoodda/ [by VR6){mila -wi
+]add
see PRES +(I U)N+a} ~ {mila-'wadda} [by CCR12) 'we see him'
+A
~ /milawadda/PHONEnCSANDPHONOUDGY118(b) That CCR11 does not need to be ordered with respect to VR6 follows from
the fact that the sequence {i+ngi} arises only from a tense prefix (see section
3.9.3.2.3) and a following first person pronominal prefix, neither of which bears
stress.
(c) VR6 and CCRlO may be assumed to apply simultaneously, both preceding
VR5. The j- [ :~~~c] affected by CCR 10 must be a part of the nominative or
accusative first person restricted (see section 3.6) pronominal prefix, and forms
such as /nyoombooliddi/ 'we swim', deriving from {nyoombool-wi+jidd+ad
(swim-PRES+(lR)N+A) show that CCRlO cannot precede VR6 since, by VR6,
{w} would not be lost in the stressed syllable {'wi} arising by applying CCRlO
to (wi+'ji}. (It is still possible for VR6 to be made to follow CCRlO (if, for
example, it is decided that the rules of external sandhi should follow those of
internal sandhi), by marking the i arising from CCR 10 by a diacritic such as
""f(ront)"", indicating its derivational history.)
Since both forms of the first person restricted pronominal bear stress, VR5 cannot
apply to vowel sequences arising from VR6 and CCRIO in examples such as
{danymili -wi
+jidd
+a} ~ {danymili-'idda}
'we hear it'
PRES +(lR)N +A
hear
~ /danymiliidda/
~ ['trepmtli'trA] or ['tre]lmt'li:rA]
The second alternative is the normal phonetic realisation of /danymiliidda/
'we hear it', the first being the most careful pronunciation of elicitation sessions.
Sequences of unstressed-stressed vowels arising from V-wi+ji{ddln} are not
dealt with in the rules of sections 2.4.2.2 and 2.4.2.3. As the preceding example
indicates, /i-'i/ normally becomes a stressed long [i:], as does /oo-'i/:
{boolooboo -wi
follow
PRES+'jidd
+a} ~
+(lR)N +A{boolooboo-'idda)'we follow him'~/booloobiidda/
['pGllGl'pi:rA]
The sequence /a-'i/ appears to be normally realised as [e't]
CCR16 cannot apply before VR6, since the form /milaaloona/ 'I see them'
derives from {mila-wi+li+bin+a} (see-PRES+(lsg)N+(3pl)A+A) by first applying
CCR9 to get {mila-wiloona}. However, there is no counter-evidence to the
assumption that the two rules apply simultaneously on forms such as {milawiloona} 'I see them', to delete the {w}, and harmonise the ( i} with the following
{oo).
~The reason why VR5 has been ordered to precede CCR13 is that {ad will
harmonise with a long /aa/ vowel derived from the sequence /a-il by VR5:

"5.6.1.1 Projection of speech
Speech is normally reported in the form of a 'direct quote', which provides a
possible wording for the spoken utterance. That is, it represents an utterance
concerning the world as it might have been, or might be spoken; it does not
directly refer to a situation or relation of the world. The deictic categories of
tense, person, spatial deixis, etc. are all shifted to the reference point of the
speech situation referred to. Quoted speech clauses are usually projected by
clauses referring to the situation in which the speech was uttered. They may,
however, occur independently. A text count showed that about a third of quoted
speech clauses occur in isolation, the remaining two-thirds being projected. (See
the texts of Appendix 1; examples of independent quotations occur in lines (33)
and (52) of Text 1, line (12) of Text 2, and lines (8) and (12) of Text 3.) When
a clause is not projected by a clause of speech, the fact that it is a representation
of what was said (rather than of what happened, or will happen) may be signalled
by a change in voice quality.
Both orders, projecting preceding projected, and projected preceding
projecting, occur. The former predominates in elicited responses to prompts of
the type ""x told y to' ...""'; however, a textual count showed approximately the
same frequency of each order. Examples are, respectively, (5-337), and line (38)
of Text 1.
(5-337) migami -ngadda
she:told to:mengaraggi/a dillybag gardiya
I:make:itwhite:peoplengangjawili
I:will:give:him
'She told me ""I make dillybags to sell to white people"".'
Sometimes the quoted clause is discontinuous, flanking the projecting clause on
both sides- see for example line (51) of Text 1, and (5-342) below.
The relationship between the projected and the projecting clause appears to
be paratactic: there is no convincing evidence that the projected quotation is
subordinate to the clause of communication. (There is certainly no evidence thatTHE CLAUSE414the directly quoted clause is embedded: in particular, the quotation clearly does
not fulfil a similar role to thangarndi 'word' in thangarndi jijagji (word he:said)
'he spoke words'.)
There are two main types of clause that project direct quotations.
(a) Projecting clauses are predominantly clauses of speech or verbal
communication. The main lexical verbs referring to such processes are:migajagjijagyan.gingoowajbaajangirooddijgamalg-'say, tell, do'
'say, tell'
'say, speak'
'request, ask'
'call by name, tell'
'shout out'
'answer, reply'
'argue, swear'
'speak, say, tell' (avoidance style lexeme)This classification of speech act types is quite different from the classification I
have proposed in section 5.4.1. It does not distinguish assertions from
proposals, both of which (in all their subtypes) occur in quotes with each of the
verbs listed, except perhaps for rooddij- 'argue, swear', which normally occurs
only in reference to exclamations and proposals. Yan.gin- 'ask, request', for
example, indicates either a request for information (a question), as in (5-338), or
a request for action, as in (5-339):yan.ginli
yoowooloo garndiwangooddoo

(5-339) yan.ginngindi maa winhi ngangbindi
he:asked:me
meat maybe you:will:give:me
'He requested of me ""Will you give me some meat?"".'
It might be expected that clauses referring to bodily processes such as nyimij'wink', nyamnyam- 'whisper', could project direct quotes. However, the only
potential example available is
(5-340) midda -ngga nginnginmi marlami
head
ERG he:shook:it nothing
'He shook with his head ""Nothing"".'","[397, 398]"
"The expected forms nganyi-yidda (I-ALL) and nganyi-yoo (1-DAT) do not occur.
However, this is the only context in which the oblique form may realise the
Entity function. If there is an intervening morpheme, such as a number marking
postposition, the nominative form occurs:
(3-77) ngidi-yooddoo -yoo gamba
we(R) DU
DAT water
'He'll show it to us two.'binabinawangiddangiyi
he:will:show:it:to:us:twoFinally, the oblique form is found in what would appear to be a type of
circumstance, indicating that the Actor did the process alone, or by him/herself.
The clause may be transitive, intransitive, or reflexive/reciprocal.
(3-78) ngaddagi -moowa ngoorloogla

POSTPOSIDONS173thaanoonggoo

'They pulled themselves up by themselves.'
If the pronominals in (3-78) and (3-80) were NP constituents it would beexpected that they might occur in construction with postpositions, indicating
their role in the clause. However, they never do (in the available examples), and
moreover they contrast with PPs such as yoowarni-ngga (one-ERG) 'by one' in
(3-81). Contrast this with (3-78) above.
(3-81) yoowarni -ngga ngoorloogla
one
ERG I:drank:it
'I drank it alone.'
In this respect the oblique forms resemble adverbials, and an alternative
(perhaps equally valid) parts-of-speech classification might place the nominative
pronominals in the class on nominals, and the oblique and emphatic
pronominals in the adverbial class.
The forms I have labeled emphatic are used very similarly to the 'adverbial'
function of the oblique just discussed, but seem to be somewhat stronger,
indicating that not only did the Actor act alone, or as a unified group, but
he/she/they did so for his/her/their own benefit:

3.7 Postpositions
3.7.1 Preliminary remarks
The postpositions form a small class of non-ranking form units which enter into
constituency with noun phrases, forming postpositional phrases. They are
bound, phrase-level morphemes which typically occur one per phrase, and
attached to any word in the phrase, regardless of its position or role (see section
4.2 below).
Gooniyandi has fourteen postpositions. These may be divided initially into
two groups, as shown below:TIIEWORD174Number markingCase marking

-yoo- -woo
-ya
-nhingi

DEP(rivative)-yooddoo - yiddi
-yarndiDU(al)
PL(ural)This classification is primarily semantic, although there is at least one
formal correlate: the number markers appear to be distributionally restricted to
nominals, whilst the case markers may also occur on adverbials (see page 140
above). The two members of the second column indicate a property of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached, namely its number- and hence their
label ""number marking"" postpositions. The postpositions in the first column,
on the other hand, do not indicate any property of quality of the referent of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached. Rather, they relate that referent to
something else. I have labeled these as ""case marking"" postpositions because
they express a range of functions that are covered by case-suffixes in many
Australian languages (we will.be returning to this point shortly, and later again
in section 42).
Most Australian languages have a set of suffixes comparable with those
laid out above for Gooniyandi (see Dixon 1980:293-301, 322-326). Most
grammars, however, classify the suffixes quite differently. It is customary to
distinguish between case suffixes and derivational suffixes. The former are
inflectional, and give rise to different forms of a single word appropriate to
different syntactic environments, while the latter are non-inflectional, and
produce new lexemes from other lexical items to which they are attached (Dixon
1980:293, 323; see also Huddleston 1984:25). In section 4.2 it is shown that
none of the morphemes listed above are inflections; it can also be demonstrated
that none are derivational suffixes.
Grammars of Australian languages usually treat the comitative, and the
number markers as derivational suffixes (Dixon 1980:324-325). It is easy toPOSTPOSIDONS175show that the number markers are not derivational: they indicate the number of
the whole phrase, not the word to which they are attached (see page 278 below).
The comitative postposition is not a derivational morpheme, since it regularly
attaches to a full NP (as in example (4-80)), and there is no evidence that the
constituent that it attaches to becomes a new lexical item. These same reasons,
show that none of the remaining postpositions are derivational suffixes.
The comitative, though not the dual and plural markers, do, it is true,
occasionally have derivational uses. But this occasional use stands in contrast
with the productive uses of this morpheme as a case marking postposition (see
section 3.7.2.9 below). It might also be noted on the one hand that the
morphemes which I have classified as stem forming suffixes ALWAYS
functional derivationally, and on the other, that -nhingi ABLlt as well as
possibly -ngga ERG and -binyi PER also on occasions form new lexical items
from the one to which they are attached.
I refer to the morphemes in the left hand column above as case marking
postpositions because they fulfil functions which are associated with case
inflections in many languages, including many Australian languages - they
indicate the function of the phrase in the unit of which it is a constituent (cf.
Dixon 1980:292). However, this should not obscure the important difference
that in Gooniyandi the case markers do not form inflectional variants of a
lexeme (see section 4.2 for further discussion of this issue).
One important consequence of this difference is that, unlike most
Australianist grammarians, I do not identify a zero-marked absolutive case,
which contrasts with the ergative. There are a number of reasons for this
descriptive strategy. Firstly, it would imply a postposition which had an
invariant zero form. Whilst it is possible to maintain such a notion, there is
simply no evidence in the language which lends support to it. (To argue this
would be tantamount to arguing that subject NPs in English were in fact
prepositional phrases with a zero preposition.) Indeed, what evidence there is
leads us to reject the idea: to maintain that there were a zero postposition would
imply that the zero marked unit were an exocentric construction; this is in fact
false. Secondly, zero marking does not signal anything in itself, but the absence
of other meanings. Thirdly, no significant semantic or syntactic generalisation
arises under the zero postposition hypothesis.
All but four of these postpositions show phonologically conditioned
allomorphic alternations, as follows:
(i) -ngga ERG. This postposition is affected by two sandhi rules. One is rule
R9, by which -ngga dissimilates to-ga following a vowel that is preceded by a1761HEWORDnasal-stop sequence (see examples on page 98 above). The other is rule R9,
which inserts an epenthetic /i/ when the root ends with the velar nasal. For
example, gooddanggooddang-ingga (diverbird-ERG) 'by the diverbird'.
(ii) {y} initial postpositions. Nine of the postpositions have an initial f y}. Inaccordance with rule R6 of section 2.4.2.3.1, this initial segment hardens to /j/
following non-continuant consonants. Few Gooniyandi nominals end in
consonants, and in most cases the form of the postposition with initial /j/ is
attested only when the nominal is a borrowing from English, or when the
postposition is attached to a verbal root with a final stop or nasal (see below).
Examples illustrating the hardening process are: Jag-joo (Jack-OAT) 'for Jack',
babligaj-jaljanggal-jiddal-jayil-jayoo!-jawoo (pub-LOC/ABJ..dALLtfALLjALL:J
ALL4) 'at/from/to the pub', goorij-jangga (hold-AB~ 'from holding', and Dayibjooddoot-jarndi (Dave-DU/PL) 'a pair/group including Dave'.
(iii) -woo DAT. The verb specific allomorph -woo of the dative postposition issubject to VR6, the effect of which is to harden the initial ( w} to /g/ when
following a non-continuant, as for instance in gaj-goo (cut-DAT) 'for cutting'
and ngarag-goo (make-DAT) 'for making'.
The -yooddoo- -yiddi allomorphy is not phonologically conditioned. The
choice seems to be a matter of speaker's preference: some speakers use the
former, while others prefer the latter. (Today at least, the two forms do not
appear to be dialectal variants associated with distinct regions.)
In addition to occurring in constituency with NPs, some postpositions also
occur in constituency with PPs, adverbials and/or non-finite clauses. The first
possibility gives rise to sequences of postpositions, since the postpositions
from each PP are typically attached to the same d-word. Only a small subset of
the sequences that COULD occur actually DO occur. The first member of any
postposition sequence must be one of -nhingi ABLI> -ngaddi COMIT, -binyi
PER, -yooddoo DU, or -yarndi PL. Of these, the number markers -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL can be follow~ by any other postposition (note also that they are
always flrst in a postposition sequence). The remaining three, the case markers,
may be followed by the ergative -ngga only.
Postposition sequences may also arise when a PP is embedded as a constituent of
an NP which is itself embedded in a PP. No new sequences arise in this way.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"488TOPICS IN SEMANI'ICS6.4 Clause modifying particles and adverbials
6.4.1 mangaddi 'not'
This Iexeme is a negative particle which usually has the role of Propositional
Modifier, and indicates that the proposition in its scope is false. It may perhaps
be most accurately glossed 'it is not the case that' - in preference to 'not',
which is a VP constituent in English. (However, for convenience, I will use the
label 'not' in glossing the morpheme, under the understanding that this is an
abbreviation for the longer expression.) The modified proposition may be in any
tense or mood category. (In this respect Gooniyandi differs from many languages
of the Kimberleys, including Ungarinyin (Rumsey 1982b:89), Nyikina (Stokes
1982:280), Nyulnyul (my own fieldnotes), and Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:85) at
least, in which the negative particle occurs with unreal (irrealis and occasionally
negative) modes only.) The meanings of the combinations of mangaddi 'not'
with the various verbal categories are predictable, and will be mentioned at the
relevant points in the discussion of the verbal categories in section 6.5 below.
The word order generalisations made above (section 5.4.1) apply to
mangaddi 'not'. The only thing that needs to be added on this is that occasionally
two instances of mangaddi 'not' are found in a single clause, as illustrated in the
following two examples. (There are no examples of this phenomenon for other
particles.)

"18INTRODUCI10NUnlike its counterpart in Dyirbal, Dyalnguy (Dixon 1972:32), the
Gooniyandi avoidance style is not a fully distinct and separate language, with its
own vocabulary. Nor is it obligatorily and mechanically chosen in response to a
fully predetermined interaction type. As Rumsey (1982a:160) has poin:ed o~t,
the use of the style is ""a part of the means for CONSTITUTING the relationship
between the interactants as one of 'avoidance' or potential affinehood"" (his
emphasis). The avoidance style is characterised by a cluster of formal features
and strategies of language use which distinguish it from other Gooniyandi styles
of speech, and which may be found to varying degrees in actual utterances.
Different degrees of avoidance can thus be 'marked' or 'indicated' by varying
usage of avoidance features (see below).
In formal terms, the avoidance style differs somewhat in lexicon, but has
the same bound morphemes as ordinary Gooniyandi. There are over one hundred
distinct avoidance Iexemes; these tend to be longer than ordinary words, and to
exhibit a higher frequency of heterogeneous consonant clusters than is found in
ordinary words. Not every ordinary word has a distinct avoidance counterpart,
however. Some gaps, such as the absence of terms for sexual organs and acts are
expected; others are not- for example, despite intensive questioning, I was able
to find a distinct term for only one animal, the dog. (I have been unable to
discern general principles characterising the lexical range of the avoidance
vocabulary.)
Avoidance words in Australian languages tend to be more general than their
everyday counterparts (Dixon 1972, Haviland 1978, Rumsey 1982a). In
Gooniyandi it is primarily the verbal roots of the avoidance style that are more
general than their ordinary counterparts. For instance, gamalg- 'say, tell, speak,
etc.' has a range of meanings that is covered by a number of more specific
everyday terms, including jag- 'say', jijag- 'speak', miga- 'tell', etc. Avoidance
verb roots typically occur with a larger range of classifiers (see section 3.9.3.2)
than do ordinary verbs, and in this way some, though certainly not all, of the
lexical ambiguity may be resolved. The avoidance verb root gamalg-, for
example, occurs with the classifier +MI 'effect' to convey the sense 'tell, say';
with +DI 'catch' to convey the sense 'put a question'; and with +I 'be, go' to
convey the sense 'speak, talk'. On the other hand, jag- occurs with only the
classifier +MI, jijag- with only +I, and mig a- with only +MI and +I. In this
respect the Gooniyandi avoidance style contrasts sharply with the Bunuba one
whic.h.has a particular auxiliary verb (see page 6 above, and Rumsey I982a: 167)
spe~tftc to th~ ~tyle .. In the Bunuba system, the choice of auxiliary verb is not
available to dtstmgmsh among the senses of a lexical verb root.","[30, 31]"
"It is suggested that the salient syllable marks the FOCUS of the366THE CLAUSEinformation uniL The Focus is the item which the speaker presents as the most
newsworthy, and not recoverable from the preceding discourse; it is always NEW,
in terms of the given/new opposition. In using the term 'new' I do not mean to
suggest that the item must not have been mentioned in the (immediately)
preceding text, or that it may not be present in the extralinguistic situation, as
some writers such as Fronek (1983) have suggested. Rather, as Halliday has
pointed out in many places, new properly applies to items that are evaluated as
not predictable in the circumstances of their occurrence. Thus, for instance, an
entity that the speaker may be sure is identifiable by the hearer, or even present
in his consciousness at the time, may be assigned the value of focal or new, if it
fulfils an unpredictable role in the clause, or if, unpredictably, it plays a role in
the clause at all. This fact has been recognised by Dan~ (1974:111); Chafe, by
contrast, has defined GIVEN as that which is presumed present in the
consciousness of the hearer (1976:30).
In the view proposed here, given and new are LINGUISTIC categories, and
the speaker has available the CHOICE of treating a piece of information as one or
the other. S/he is neither constrained nor forced by extralinguistic factors to
make any particular choice. In other words, the categories given and new are not
pregrammatical or prelinguistic, as has been suggested by writers such as Heath
(1984:606); and furthermore, it is not possible to say on the basis of an
inspection of the linguistic and extralinguistic context that a particular item is
either given or new. There is at best a correlation between the linguistic
categories and the extralinguistic ones, whereby they agree in the majority of
cases. Viewing given and new as pre- or extra-linguistic, linguists have been
forced to conclude that they have no fixed realisation in grammar. By taking the
view advocated in systemic functional grammar, it is clear that there is a direct
relationship between form and meaning - although not between form and
reference. To exemplify this discussion, consider an extract from Text 1 (line
(5)), repeated here as example (5-213).

Given the textual context of its occurrence, it would be natural for the speaker to
presume that the hearer is able to identify the two individuals referred to by
bidiyooddoongga 'by they two', and even that they were in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. But to claim that this phrase is therefore given is to miss
the point; there is no reason for a hearer to suppose that only the two individuals11ffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF 11ffi CLAUSE367other than the speaker went to look at the fishing lines in the morning. This is
the reason why the speaker chose to represent bidiyooddoongga 'by they two' as
new and focal information. Thus, only by maintaining the distinction between
linguistic meaning and reference (or core and contextual meaning) can significant
generalisations be made.
The salient syllable most frequently falls on one of the stressed syllables of
the final clausal IC (phrase, adverbial or particle) in the tone unit An exception
to this generalisation concerns the group of clauses which I have referred to as
situations of being (see section 5.2.1.2). These are clauses which have one of
the three stance verbs bagi- 'lie', warang- 'sit' and wara- 'stand', and assert either
the existence of an entity, an attribute of an entity, or a niche the entity
inhabits. In these clauses, the VP always comes finally in the tone unit to
which it belongs, and is never salient. Any stressed syllable within the salient
phrase may have the main stress, although there may be a tendency for the main
stress to fall on the main lexical item in the IC. Salience placement is probably
semantically conditioned: apparently in NPs it identifies phrase level focus, that
is, the item evaluated as the most newsworthy item of the phrase.
It follows from the preceding paragraph that the information Focus usually
falls on the final IC in an information unit This is, however, a tendency, and
not a grammatical rule. Any distributional word in the information unit,
regardless of its position, may be focal. It is hypothesised that the UNMARKED
place for information Focus is on the final IC in the information unit. This
placement is unmarked in respect that the preceding material in the information
unit may be either given or new. An information unit with final Focus may
thus occur in any of the three logically possible circumstances, where the
preceding material is given, new, or some given and some new. The Focus is
MARKED when it occurs on a non-final constituent Here again, the preceding
material may be either given, new, or some given and some new. But the
material following the Focus is positively specified as given or retrievable. That
is, the Focus falls on a non-final constituent only under the condition that the
material following it is given. Conversely, placement of given information
following new information may be presumed to be a marked order.
A number of observations support this claim.
(1) Contrastive focus normally falls on a non-final constituent. For
example,

'We split up; I went down, he went up.'
\\eAs is well known (see for example Chafe 1976:33-34}, a contrastive clause
normally involves a presupposition that the situation obtained for someone,
something, or in certain circumstances, or that a certain individual (or time,
place, etc.) was involved in some situation or other. (5-214) is a direct quote and
comes from a text in which a head police tracker is giving instructions to
another tracker. It is reasonable to assume that there is a presupposition that
each would go in some direction.
(5-214) and (5-215) show that the presupposed material (or a linguistic
expression representing it in whole or part) follows the Focus. What is
presupposed is of course given, and is explicitly marked as such by its
placement after the Focus. On the other hand, being given, presupposed material
is likely to be ellipsed, resulting in a construction with unmarked Focus- see
line (41) of Text 1.
(2) The placement of the propositional modifiers mangaddi 'no, not',
yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed', etc., conftrm the above pattern.
Immediately following non-final foci are contrastive. Consider example (5-216},
which comes from a text concerning a man who got lost in the desert. The
immediately preceding text had described him starting on his way back home.
Thus it is presupposed that he was returning home, and the material following
the Focus, wardji riwiyidda 'he went to his camp', constitutes given information.
The adverbial thiddgirli 'straight' is thus a point of contrastive focus, contrasting
with the Focus of the following information unit, ngilayani ngiwayinyali 'east
and south again'.riwiyidda I ngiwayi wardji

either formally by morphology or syntax, or, as far as I can tell, prosodically.
Information requests are made indirectly by statements offering some
information, but leaving something indefinite (cf. Eades 1982). In this way, the
speaker may hope to elicit a response filling in the indefmite blank. Information
requests use the indefinite determinersjaji 'something', ngoorndoo 'someone' and
ngoonyoo 'something', as well as the adverbials yiniga 'somehow' and
yaningimi (morphologically 'now-indefinite') 'sometime'. These indefinite words
are always the information Focus in information requests - but not all
utterances in which they are focal are questions, or construed as questions. The
reason for this is obvious: the speaker would quite naturally single out and draw
attention to the indefinite or unknown part of his utterance, the part s/he seeks
elaboration of or comment on, as the most newsworthy. In addition, the
indefinite word is typically non-final (unless it is the only element in the unit),
and a marked information Focus. (5-217) is an example:
(5-217) ngoorndoo -ngga ngaaddi widdbginyja I
someone
ERG stone
you:throw:it
'Who are you throwing stones.'
The explanation for the fact that the indefinite word is a marked Focus is
that questions are pragmatically marked (see Goody 1978), and typically involve
a presupposition that the predication holds true for at least one entity, place,
time, etc .. And this presupposition may be treated as given information. For
(5-217), the action was of course situationally obvious.
I remark that in ''rhetorical questions'"" - that is, utterances which look like
questions but which are not used to elicit infonnation, and for which straight
linguistic responses would be judged inadequate - the indefinite word is not
nonnally focal. The Focus is unmarked, and falls on the VP in (5-218), which is a
quoted utterance of a white head stockman to his Aboriginal workers questioning
their action of cutting a bullock skin which he had explicitly instructed them not
to do. Presumably he was not merely seeking infonnation.
-yoo gajgilanggidda I
(5-218) jaji
something DAT you:plural:have:cut:it
'Why have you cut it?'
In a similar way, when the indefmite word is followed by either -widdi UNKN or
-ngaddaya TOO, there is not usually any presupposition involved. And the
indefinite word, or the distributional word it forms a part of, does not nonnally
constitute a marked Focus. These observations are exemplified in (5-219), which
shows that the resulting utterance closely approximates clauses with indefinites in
English:370THE ClAUSE

"TilE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OFTIIE ClAUSE375The significance of the conttast between rising and falling contours is unclear.
However, the falling intonation seems to be associated with a Theme that is not
initial in the sentence, as is the case in (5-231)- cf. Kilham (1977:89).
Qualifying material may be interpolated (on its own intonation contour)
between a segmented Theme and the remainder of the clause. Such interpolated
material always occurs on a secondary and falling tone unit. An example is(5-232) maja I babligaj -joo maja I az
alex scott I
boss
pub
OAT boss
ah
migami -ngadda I
he:told to:me
'The boss, the publican, Alex Scott, he told me.'
Following Grimes (1975) I will use the term REPRISE in reference to the
pattern in which a Theme is segmented and placed in its own information unit,
and, which in addition, is referred to (usually) by one of the endophoric
determiners niyaji 'this' and niyi 'that'. In this construction, the endophoric
determiner always occurs initially in the second primary information unit. For
example,(5-233) wajaddi -nhingi mawoolyi jirliwa -jangi I niyaji
boab
ABL
Iittle:bits sinew
SEM this
widgoodda birdi -ya I
they:rub:it leg
LOC
'The fibres from the boab tree they rub on their legs (to make
twine).'
As this example shows, reprise is normally used when the Theme is longer than
usual (NPs of three words are rare). Compare(5-234) az . . . ngoorndoo yoowooloo niyi I wamba I

In fact, thematic reprise most frequently occurs in order to summarise full
clauses, as in line (75) of Text 1. (See section 5.6.2.2.2 below for further
discussion.)
Occasionally the usual ThemeARheme order appears to be reversed, with
what would appear to be the Rheme followed by what would appear to be the
Theme. In these circumstances, the apparent Theme always occurs on its own
information unit, as in the following examples:
(5-235) booroowanbiddi laandi I yaddbanyi yoowooloo I
they:were:hiding up
initiate
man
'They were hiding up, the initiates.'
(5-236) widdijjidda -nhi
banda ·wila I garndiwangooddoo -ngga I
we:dug:it on:him ground finish many
ERG
stockmen joorloo I
too
We dug a hole for him, everyone, the stockmen too.'
I will refer to this construction as TAGGING, following Grimes (1975). Tagging
normally serves the function of reminding the hearer of the identity of the
Theme or of making its identity explicit, in case there is a chance of ambiguity.
In either case, the tagged phrase typically refers to something already mentioned
in the text, or present in the extralinguistic context. This is the case for the two
immediately preceding examples. The tagged unit serves a function of
clarification or explication.
The tagging construction does not, I claim, contradict the ""theme first""
principle. It can be reasonably assumed that the Theme has been ellipsed, being
treated as given. Tagging it indicates that the speaker has changed his/her mind
at this point in the production of the text. The speaker now decides to treat the
information as not given, or at least as requiring some form of elaboration.
(Note that tagged constituents occur on secondary tone units with falling pitch;
this is characteristic of qualifying information units, as in (5-194) above.)
In the examples so far the Theme has usually been a simple clausal
constituent, either a nominal phrase (NP or PP), or an adverbial. In oneTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE377example, namely (5-227), the Theme was a complex of such units. Word
complexes and phrase complexes of all types (see section 4.3 above) can be
thematic. However, it is not clear that the Theme must always be realised by a
grammatical unit or a complex of grammatical units. Consider, for example,
(5-237):
(5-237) yingi ... number six I gardiya
-ngga
name
white:people ERG
goowajgoodda I six furlong I niyaji -yangga
they:call:it
this
ABLz
booloodooddwinmi yawarda I garndiwangooddoo I
they:started:off
horse
many
'(The spot) called six furlongs - what white people call it is six
furlongs - from there they started off, all the horses.'
The second clause in this example is divided into two information units, the first
of which has the rising pitch associated with segmented Themes, and consists of
an ERG PP and a VP. As the translation suggests, this clause has a natural
interpretation as a WH-cleft. These two facts suggest that the sequence
gardiyangga goowajgoodda 'white people call it' is a good candidate for Theme.
The constituent realising the Theme of a clause usually realises at the same
time some other role in the clause (or part thereof), experiential or interpersonal.
There is one exception to this, in which the thematic element has an entirely
textual role. The d-words niyinhingi (that-ABL) 'after that, from there',
niyajinhingi (this-ABL) 'after this', and migaya (thus-LOC) 'at that time' are
frequently used as conjunctive elements. The first two are sentential
conjunctions (see for instance lines (49) and (79) of Text 1, and line (3) of Text
3); the third normally conjoins clauses within a single sentence. These
connecting words are almost always thematic, providing a 'starting point' for the
clause/sentence.
The interpersonal role Propositional Modifier, which is realised by
particles and temporal adverbials (see next section), frequently combines with the
textual role of Theme. For examples see (5-216) above and next section. Some
Particles such as mangaddi 'no, not' are invariably thematic; others, including
yiganyi 'uncertain' need not be, although they usually are. If not thematic, they
are typically focal.
The experiential role of Actor (see section 5.2.1.3 above) is statistically
the most frequent choice of Theme in situation clauses. In non-situation clauses
it is the thing characterised or identified that is the preferred choice of Theme.","[358, 359, 360, 361]"
"It is possible, but by no means certain, that this involves a use of the type (x)
'precisely': 'I tickled him and that's exactly why he laughed'.
McConvell (1983a) has proposed that again in English, and -rningan -which
is usually glossed 'again'- in Gurindji are both characterisable in the following
way:I
1468TOPICS IN SEMANTICS1
'(6-68) again
Presupposition (P): S2 at a time before T.
Assertion (A): S 1 at T.
where S2 is a subpart of S 1 up to and including S 1; the relation
between S 1 and S 2 being defined by a set of scope rules.
(McConvell1983a:4).
McConvell (1983a) suggests that the differences in scope of the two morphemes
in English and Gurindji account for the differences in range of meaning between
the two languages, and that the differences in scope are due mainly to the fact
that the English morpheme is a free word whereas the Gurindji morpheme is an
enclitic.
(6-68) clearly describes at least a part of the range of -nyali REP delimited
above. However, it is not clear that the presuppositions involved in the use of
-nyali REP are necessarilyfull situations (referred to by full clauses). It would
seem that normally only subparts of situations are presupposed by, and relevant
to, the use of -nyali REP. For this reason, and secondly, lacking a set of scope
rules, I propose a modification to (6-68) for a description of the formal meaning
of -nyali REP. In order to keep the two approaches distinct, I will use the term
PRESUMED (following Rochester and Martin 1979:55) when making reference to
parts of situations. The term 'presupposed' will be reserved for full situations
only. It follows that -nyali REP typically relates the constituent in its scope to
some presumed antecedent. (6-68) may be replaced by:
(6-69) -nyali REP
Presumed: At at some time before T
Asserted: A2 at T
where At and A 2 are subparts (either proper or improper) of the
situation, determined by the scope of -nyali REP, and A 1 is less
than or equal to A 2, this relation having the subset and scalar
interpretations.
It is clear that in general A 1 and A 2 are identical: for example, in (6-31), A 1 and A2
both refer just to the process mila- 'see', excluding all participants, circumstances,
etc .. The qualification that A 1 may be included in A 2 is necessary, not only for the
'back to a former state or position' sense of (i), but for other uses, as will emerge
below.","[451, 452]"
"SPEECH STYLES19Nominal roots generally have the same meaning as their everyday
counterparts. For example, the avoidance nominal ngarloomaii 'spear'
corresponds to the ordinary generic term for spear,jinali, including in its range
precisely the same subtypes. On those occasions when I requested an avoidance
equivalent for a more specific type of spear, I was invariably given the ordinary
term. The response was invariably the same when I requested other specific
terms, and I could detect no tendency to extend the range of an avoidance
nominal beyond the range of its corresponding ordinary term. It thus appears that
avoidance nominals have exact, or nearly exact, ordinary equivalents, and can not
be used to effect higher order taxonomic groupings than those which are a1rcady
made in the ordinary language (cf. Dixon 1972:292ff).
A few closed class grammatical items also have distinct avoidance terms.
For example, there is a particle woomoorla 'no, not, nothing, without', which
corresponds to the particle mar/ami 'not, nothing, without' of the everyday style,
and perhaps also to mangaddi 'no, not' (sec page 496 below); there is also a
nominal yawinhingi 'some, other' corresponding to the everyday terms yaanya
'other' and yaabja 'some'. At least in the latter instance, a distinction made in the
everyday vocabulary is neutralised in the avoidance vocabulary.
It will come a<> no surprise that in Gooniyandi avoidance speech, as in the
Bunuba variety (Rumsey 1982a), not every word in an utterance need be- or
even could be - an avoidance word. Often only a single word in an utterance
marks it as avoidance speech, whether or not other ordinary words COULD BE
replaced by avoidance terms. Indeed, a single feature, such as use of a non·
singular free pronoun, pronominal enclitic or prefix wit11 singular reference, may
even suffice.
Strategies of language use differ between avoidance spct>.Ch and everyday
speech. There are differences in: (I) modes of address and reference; (2) frequency
of propositional modification; and (3) degree of precision of expression.
(1) A man was of course not supposed to address his actual WM; nor could
he utter her name, or a close homonym. Reference to her could be oblique (e.g.
by using the term moonga 'dark'}, by use of a marked or triangular kin-tenn (e.g.
manaroo '(your) mother', speaking toW or WB), or by use of the third person
non-singular pronominal bidi 'they'. Other maddiyali, with whom speech was
permitted, were addressed with the second person non-singular pronominal gidi,
instead of the singular form nginyji. S/he would be referred to by means of the
third person plural bidi if the relationship was a close one, but otherwise more
frequently by the singular niyi; and the first person unrestricted yaadi 'we three or
more inclusive' would be used instead of ngidi 'we two, we exclusive' (seeINTRODUCTION20· 3 .6) m

and woomoorla and mar/ami 'no, without' are also more frequent m avmdancc
speech, presumably with the intended effect of softening the force of the
utterance (cf. Stubbs 1983:113).
(3) Avoidance speech is characteristically vaguer in expression than is
ordinary speech (Rumsey 1982a:l73, McConvell 1982:97), and this vagueness
is iconic of the relation of avoidance or lack of intimacy which it t~nccxles.
Although an avoidance verb is typically vaguer than an ordinary one, much of
the potential ambiguity is resolved once the context is ta.ken into account. For
example, in
(1-1) malab -migooddgoo
make he:effected:it hole
'He dug a hole.'it is quite clear that the intended sense of malab- 'make, construct' is 'dig'. It
should be noted that potential ambiguities are rarely if ever rcsolvctl by
paraphrase in actual texts (cf. Dixon 1972:293). And I suspect that this is partly
because in real terms the ambiguity of a contextualised utterance is usually
relatively small, and far less than the potential ambiguity, and partly because
vagueness is an inherent semantic characteristic, and not just a formal fc.altlrc of
the avoidance style.","[31, 32, 33]"
"TilE WORD134It is necessary to distinguish the g-word from the lexical word, the third
type of word, for which I will sometimes also use the term ""lexeme"". Lexemesare those items which are listed in the dictionary. I include here both morphemes
of all types and certain larger, word-like units which are constructions of
morphemes; but I will exclude idiomatic collocations. The larger unit may be
either an inflectional form of one of the constituent morphemes, the root, or it
may constitute a distinct lexical item, a stem. On the whole, Gooniyandi shows
little inflection. Most of the inflection which does occur is found in the verbal
classifier complex, discussed in section 3.9.3.2 below. A small amount of
inflection is found elsewhere, in pronominals and some spatial adverbials. The
various forms of these words are not readily analysable into constituent
morphemes. For example, nginyji 'you (sg)' and ngaanggi 'yours (sg)' are two
forms of the lexeme ""second person singular"", but neither is amenable to
morphemic analysis (see section 3.6).
Fourthly, there are distributional words, abbreviated d-words, which are free
forms having the property that they cannot be divided into units each of which is
free. Any utterance consists of a whole number of d-words; these are the
minimal forms that may be permuted, the permutations preserving
grammaticality. Constituents of d-words are in general not permutable.
Postpositions (see section 3.7) are the only exceptions: they may be attached to
any g-word in a nominal phrase. For example, (3-5) consists of three d-words,
all orders of which are possible:
(3-5) nganyi -ngga manyi muri -faI
ERG food
'I'll bring you food.'go-wila
-nganggi
SUBJ I:will:do:it for:youBut the parts of the words cannot be permuted either within, or amongst
the separate words: -ngga ERG, for example, could not be attached to manyi
'food', nor could it occur anywhere in the verbal d-word.
D-words may be bounded by pauses, but it is only under exceptional
circumstances that pauses occur within d-words. For example, at the end of my
first field trip, having spent a full hour giving me person, number and tense
forms of verbs, my teacher finally began to tire of the task, and pauses occurred
between the verbal stem and the following classifier complex. However, during
these pauses the articulatory organs did not go back to their rest position, but
were held in place until the form was recalled and the d-word could be completed.
When the pause became too long, or the articulators were not held in place,
renewed attempts always started again at the beginning of the d-word. In thesePARTS-OF-SPEECH135sessions of intensive elicitation of the verbal paradigm I was never given just
the paradigmatically significant piece, the classifier complex; I was always given
the full form with the initial lexical item. In the entire body of texts I recorded
there are no more than a handful of instances in which there is a perceptible
pause within ad-word. Where they occur, these pauses always coincide with
morpheme boundaries, and appear to usually occur when the speaker is suffering
from a momentary lapse in memory or concentration.
Although single d-words could be elicited and discussed in isolation native speakers of Gooniyandi were willing to explain their meaning to me smaller items could not be. Smaller items such as bound morphemes did not
seem to have psychological reality, and were not identified on the few occasions
when, for one reason or another, I cited them in isolation. (They were, however,
immediately identified in retrospect once I provided an example in a d-word.)
The four types of word we have identified do not always coincide in
Gooniyandi. However, some correlations can be made between them. Every gword consists of one or more lexemes, but not every lexeme is a g-word. For
example, mangaddi 'no, not' is a lexeme, but not a g-word (it is not a ranking
item). And distinct g-words may be instantiations of a single lexeme. This is the
case for pronominals, which show two distinct case forms. Every d-word
consists of a whole number of phonological words and a whole number of
lexemes; moreover it consists of either a whole number of, or zero g-words. A
phonological word normally consists of a whole number of lexical words, and a
whole number of, or zero g-words. Exceptions arise within the verbal d-word,
where the two obligatory lexical g-words (the verbal stem and the classifier
complex) which typically constitute separate phonological words, may become
fused together in such a way that the boundary of the phonological word shifts
forward (see section 2.5.3 above). In most of the remainder of this chapter, I will
be referring to phonological words only in passing. The other three types arise
more frequently, and are more easily confused; I will therefore normally use the
more explicit labels to make the reference clear.
3.2 Parts-of-speechIn this section I suggest a classification of the parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi,
embracing all words and morphemes.l The entities I want to classify are the
1 In including both words and morphemes in this classification I am going
against the usual practice of grammarians, who normally include only words, and
not morphemes, in their parts-of-speech classification. There seems to be no1HEWORD136lexical items themselves (see above). abstracted from all context; I do not aim to
classify the g-words and morphemes, the units of the rank scale. A classification
of the lexemes will provide more information than would a classification of the
contextualised units, and it is mainly for this reason that I undertake the former
enterprise.
The major difficulty in assigning Gooniyandi lexical words and morphemes
to classes is their multifunctionality: most occur in a number of distinct
syntagmatic environments. A form such as yoowooloo 'man', for example,
occurs in at least the following five contexts:
(3-6) NP[ngirndaji yoowooloo ]NPthis
'this man'man(3-7) pp[ngidi-yooddDo
we(R) DUyoowooloo]ppman'we two men'
(3-8} yp[yoowooloo -windz]ypman
he:becarne
'He became a man.'
(3-9) K[yoowooloo lK
man
'Man!'
(3-10) N[yoowooloo -mili]Nman
'man-crazy'CHARBut there are, however, a number of reasons which suggest that yoowooloo
'man' is a single lexeme uniquely assignable to the class nominal. Firstly, the
commonalty of meaning through the examples suggests that there is a single
morpheme yoowooloo 'man' throughout (3-6) to (3-10); what differences there
are are fairly obviously attributable to the different grammatical environments.
Secondly, a sizeable class of words, all of which are notionally nouns, appear to
convincing reason for this restriction, and since I will be later making use of
various more general labels for morphemes (labels such as nominal suffix), I have
felt that a complete classification would be advantageous at this point to the
reader, and that this small departure from tradition would thus be justified. It is
also for this reason that I have eschewed the term 'word class', and used the more
traditional label 'part-of-speech'.","[118, 119, 120, 121]"
"···PARTS-OF-SPEECH137be able to occur in most of the environments in which yoowooloo 'man' occurs,
and certainly always in the first two. Restrictions are generally attributable to
semantic and cultural factors. For example, many words that are notionally
nouns have not been encountered in contexts like (3-9); the reason for this is
obvious: people don't normally address ants, water, trees, etc.. But these are
semantic (or pragmatic), and not grammatical restrictions, and it is easy to
invent contexts in which addressing ants or trees would not seem too unnatural
-in fact, I have a short piece of text in which the speaker addresses a particular
tree of mythical significance. On the other hand, there are lexical roots that occur
only in a subset of these environments, not including the first two, and yet other
lexemes occurring in complementary environments. Thus, even though lexemes
are multifunctional, it is possible to identify classes by occurrence in common
ranges of syntagmatic environments.
In these respects Gooniyandi would appear to be intermediate between
English and what is reportedly the norm for Australian languages. According to
Dixon (1980:271), in the majority of Australian languages lexical roots belong
to disjoint classes which are defined by occurrence in specified syntagmatic
environments. In Gooniyandi, classes defined in this way overlap considerably:
as in English, as we have seen, a single word-form can usually occur in a variety
of syntagmatic contexts. But Gooniyandi is unlike English which has a large
number of pairs like dog (noun) vs. dog (verb), bottle (noun) vs. bottle (verb),
etc., where the meaning differences are not fully predictable, thus making it
necessary for the dictionary maker to provide separate definitions for each distinct
context of occurrence. In Gooniyandi the differences of meaning are as a rule
completely predictable, and one dictionary definition will suffice.
This is not to deny the existence of homophony in Gooniyandi. As far as I
have been able to determine, however, there are very few homophones. The only
convincing examples I have been able to find are doowa 'store' and doowa 'he
gets it'; and nginyji 'you', nginyji 'certainly, indeed' and -nginyji, a form of the
classifier +DI which refers to the action of a first person singular agent on a
second person singular patient (see below section 3.9.3.2).
Most examples which at first appear to be homophones turn out on closer
examination to be single lexemes whose variant senses can be explained as
contextualisations of a single basic meaning. Consider, for example, widdijwhich translates both 'dig (a hole)' and 'scratch'; yiniga which translates as both
'how, in what manner' and 'say or do something'; miga which translates 'that
way' and 'tell, say, think'; and yiganyi which corresponds sometimes to 'maybe,
perhaps' and sometimes to 'sneakingly'. For each of these four phonemic forms IiI

speakers' glosses in various examples. Across a large number of examples
(consisting of Gooniyandi-English translation ""equivalents"") the glosses given
for the words fall into the two or three distinct English expressions as indicated
above. It seems likely, however, that these senses are not as unrelated as the
glosses would immediately suggest to the English speaker, and that each form is
a single Iexeme having a single basic meaning. Very approximately, widdijmeans 'scrape a surface with a relatively sharp or elongated instrument'; yiniga
means 'what or some manner of action'; miga means 'this manner of action'; and
yiganyi means 'uncertain, unsure' (where cultural factors determine what
constitutes lack of assurance).
The major parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi are set out in Table 3-1 below.
Each lexical word/morpheme can be uniquely assigned to a class.

"3.9.3.5 Mode
Three morphemes occur in the order-class immediately following the CC, and
are encliticised to it. They indicate the speaker's attitude towards the process, or,
rather, the situation referred to by the whole clause, and the fact of its
occurrence. In this respect they contrast with the Mood elements discussed in the
preceding section, which qualify the proposition expressed. The three
morphemes are:-nyji
-rni
-wooDesiderative (DESID)
Potential (POT)
Definite (DEF)The labels given are approximate; the significance of these morphemes will be
discussed in some detail in section 6.5.3.
These three morphemes are invariant in phonological shape. However, in
one circumstance the shape of a preceding morpheme may be affected by the
addition of an enclitic. By rule CCR13, an (a 1 } preceding the definite mode
enclitic is realised by /a/- compare /wardngirawoo/ (go-PRES/(lsg)N/1-DEF)
'I'm going!' with /wardngiri/ (go-PRES/(lsg)N/1) 'I go'. Like the majority of
monosyllabic enclitics, -nyji, -rni, and -woo cohere with the CC, constituting a
single phonological word with it.
Whereas -nyji and -rni occur only within finite VPs in order-class (5) (see
Fl on page 192 above), -woo is found also on nominals, and since the meaning
in each case appears to be conditioned by the constituent to which it is attached,
a single morpheme (an enclitic) is identified. (It should be noted that there is
another -woo, an allomorph of the dative postposition, which is homophonousTIIEWORD224with the DEF. and must not be confused with it.) All that needs to be added here
is that there are certain co-occurrence restrictions between these three morphemes
and the tense morphemes in the CC: -rni occurs only with the 'unreal' tenses
(irrealis and future); -nyji occurs with future only; and -woo, in the available
examples, occurs only with past, present and future, never with the irrealis.","[208, 209]"
"A clause may have more than one Theme. It seems that there will always
be at least one experiential role which is thematic in a clause. In addition, there
may be optionally a thematic conjunctive element or Propositional Modifier, orTiffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OFTiffi CLAUSE379a Topic. There are certain ordering tendencies: textual Themes - i.e.
conjunctions - invariably precede other types of Theme; Topics precede other
types of Theme, except for textual ones; and experiential Themes tend to be the
fmal theme. However, Propositional Modifiers may occupy any position in the
thematic sequence, the placement being semantically significant (cf. section
5.4.1).
It appears to be possible for a clause to have more than one independently
thematic experiential role. Line (61) of Text I is a convincing example. The
first tone unit, which consists of two nominal phrases, has the slight rise in
pitch associated with segmented Themes. The clause would appear to be ""about""
both the speaker and the kangaroo. It is possible that clauses such as the second
one in example (5-229) above also have two experiential Themes -an ellipsed
one, yoowarni gardiya 'one white person' (which is mentioned in the preceding
clause), and an explicit one, gamba 'water'. Multiple experiential Themes also
appear to occur quite frequently when one of them is a temporal or spatial
circumstance. These are normally starting point Themes, and the co-occurring
Theme is as a rule a participant role, which the clause is 'about'. Starting-point
Themes tend to be initial, like textual Themes - see for example line (7) of
Text 2.
I have already discussed Theme in relation to information packaging. To
conclude this section I turn briefly to Theme in relation to given and new. As I
have already remarked, the Theme is most frequently chosen from the register of
what is given. However, this is not always the case, and Themes not
infrequently convey new information, especially if there is nothing given- cf.
Halliday (1967:212). Indeed, information Focus can fall on the Theme. Such a
Focus will of course be marked, and everything other than the Theme will be
given. That is, it will be presupposed that a situation occurred, or a relationship
of identity or attribution obtains with respect to the Theme. Examples include
the first clause of (5-234), and
(5-240) jaji
-wami ngabbiddayi ginharruii -yiddi -ngga I
something IND they:two:ate:it you:know DU ERG
What is it that that pair have eaten?'gardlooni nganyi -ngga I
(5-241) gardiya
white:man I:hit:him I
ERG
1t was the white man that I hit'
(5-240) presupposes that they ate something; (5-241) that the speaker hit
someone. Sentences such as these are naturally translated into English as it-THE CLAUSE380clefts. The difference is that the Theme in the English it-cleft is an unmarked
focus, whereas it is marked in the Gooniyandi versions.
A focal Theme may be singled out and made more prominent by use of a
deictic expression such as ngirndajiya (this-LOC) 'here'. For example:ngirndaji -wami ngabgoodda I
this
LOC this
IND they:eat:it
'Here, maybe this is what they eat'(S-242) ngirndaji -yaThis example is a direct quote which comes from a narrative. The speaker was
one of a pair of young men looking around the campsite of another group of
people for the food they had been gathering. The effect of the initial deictic is to
single out the referent, drawing it to the addressee's attention.
But Gooniyandi does have a means of making a Theme into the unmarked
Focus. This is effected by employing a pair of phrases to refer to the Thematic
item. One expression occurs initially, as Theme; the other, the information
Focus, occurs finally also in its unmarked position. For example, yoowooloo
'man' and boolgawoolga 'old men' in line (1) of Text 2 both refer to the same
entity. The first phrase is the Theme, the second is the unmarked Focus.
Another example is(S-243) wanyjiddi ngoddagi -ngga yoowooloo gardbini
river:roo my
ERG man
he:hit:it
jamadda I
male:kangaroo
'A river kangaroo my son killed, a male one.'
A special case of this construction occurs when the discontinuous pieces
constitute together a single phrase experientially -see, for example, (4-16)
above and line (61) of Text 1. In general, the two parts of any discontinuous
phrase occur initially and finally, as Theme and unmarked Focus. It seems that
the main function of discontinuity in Gooniyandi is to enable a single
experiential role to fulfil more than one textual role. This construction is also
functionally different from the English it-cleft, which likewise has the effect of
making the Theme the unmarked Focus. This is because the material between
the Theme and the Focus in the Gooniyandi construction is unmarked for the
values given/new (see page 371 above). But the Theme must be new (since it is
at the same time focal), and it follows that everything following the ThemeTHE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE381must also be new. 6 This means that the clause involves no presupposition. This
is the case in the examples cited. By contrast, it-clefts in English involve
presuppositions. For further discussion of this pattern, see McGregor (1989).
Instead of occurring at different ends of a clause, a pair of phrases referring
to the same thematic item may be juxtaposed, to form a type of complex
Theme. Presumably the juxtaposed phrases may be logically related in any one
of the ways mentioned in section 4.3.1. Of particular interest is the case in
which the relationship is one of identification, whereby one phrase, usually the
first, identifies the second (cf. also section 5.2.1.1.1 above). The identifying
phrase is typically the information Focus of the clause, and following material
is of course given. That is, it is given (and presupposed) that the situation
obtained for a certain entity (time, place, or whatever), and that that entity (or
whatever) is identified by a different designation. Reference to the entity in the
given part of the communication is frequently by means of a determiner. In this
case, the construction is roughly equivalent to the English 'x is the one that
did/is y'; and the determiner in the Gooniyandi version does roughly the job of
the indefinite 'one' in the English version. Examples are line (12) of Text 2, and
(5-244) ngooddoo -ngga niyaji -ngga doownga
that
ERG this
ERG he:took:it
'That is the one who took it'
The following is a possible example of the opposite order, the Identifier
following the Identified:
ngirndaji -ngga I ngooddoo
(5-245) niyi -ngga gardbini
that ERG he:hit:him this
ERG
that
yaanya gijali I
other dead
The one who killed the other dead person is this one.'
Note that here the two coreferential phrases are not juxtaposed; in contrast to the
pattern discussed above for discontinuity in the preceding paragraph, the Theme
here is given.","[362, 363, 364, 365]"
"Identified/foken
yoowooloo
manIdentifier/Token
ldentified/Value
(5-5) ngoonyoo ngaanggi
jiginya
which
your
child
Which (one) is your child?'
The first two orders, in which the Identified is initial, are the most frequent (cf.
Kuno and Wongkhomthong 1981:79-80). The reverse order occurs mainly in
examples such as the two shown above, in which the Identifier is an indefmite
determiner which is being used interrogatively.
There is an unmarked association between the role of Identifier and the textual role
of New (see Halliday 1967:226, 1985:117, and section 5.3.1 below). However,
the association is not perfect (compare Halliday 1967:227). Partly for this reason,
and partly because, while an identifying clause need not contain a Given NP, it
always contains an Identified, the distinct experiential roles of Identifier and
Identified must be set up and distinguished from the textual roles of New and
Given.
In Gooniyandi, unlike English (see Halliday 1985: 114), there is no need to
distinguish a subtype of possessive identifying clauses which identify an item as
someone's possession. Clauses corresponding to English possessive identifying
clauses are in fact intensive (cf. Fawcett 1987): the two NPs provide alternative
designations for a single entity, the possession; they do not relate the entity and
its owner by the relationship of possession. Consider for example, clause (5-3),
which is elliptical, with the Entity nominal ellipsed from the second NP, being
given: ngiddangi 'our' realises the Deictic role in NP 2• Compare what happens
when the NPs occur in the reverse order. There are two possibilities:
(5-6) NPZ[ngiddangi riwi1NP2 NPl [ngirndaji]NPl
our
camp
this
'Our place is this (one).'",[280]
"--THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION299This clause does not identify the meat; rather, it indicates a quality or
characteristic of the meat. Characterising clauses thus consist of two inherent
roles, an Attribute and a Carrier of that Attribute (I use these terms following
Halliday 1985), and the Attribute is asserted as characterising the Carrier.
There are a number of grammatical differences between identifying and
characterising clauses in Gooniyandi; they are not just logically distinguishable
types. Firstly, the Attribute is invariably realised by an NP WITH A QUALIFIER
and an optional Entity, but no pre-Entity roles, or by a PP. On the other hand,
both the Identifier and the Identified are always realised by NPs with overt Entity
or pre-Entity roles, but NO post-Entity Qualifier; nor may they be realised by
PPs. This difference in form justifies distinguishing the Attribute from the
Identifier and Identified (cf. Halliday 1985:xx, Fawcett 1987:178, Martin
1987: 18), and as a result the contrast between identifying and characterising
clauses.
A second, derivative difference is that constituent order in intensive
identifying clauses is free, and the Identifier may precede or follow the Identified,
whereas in characterising clauses constituent order is relatively rigid. The Carrier
usually comes first, making it Theme (section 5.3.2). In the few examples of
the reverse order, the Carrier and the Attribute NPs come on distinct intonation
contours, typically with a pause between them, and a rise on the first contour.
This is a tagging construction (see page 376), and the Carrier is still Theme. An
example is:
(5-15) joodoo I ngaddagi garingi I
straight my
wife
'My wife is straight (i.e. of the correct subsection) for me?'
These facts can be explained as follows (cf. Halliday 1985:114): intensive
identifying clauses make reference to two entities, either of which is a potential
Theme. By contrast, characterising clauses refer to a single entity, the Carrier.
Because of the preference in Gooniyandi for thematising entities over qualities or
processes (see below page 378), the Carrier is the natural choice of theme. (Note
that this also explains why exemplifying and naming identifying clauses (see
above) are irreversible.)Thirdly, only (some) characterising clauses, but NO identifying clauses,
have situation clause agnates with an inherent Process referring to the mode of
'being' of the Carrier (see section 5.2.1.2.1). And fourthly, as we will see, the
two types have distinct, non-parallel subtypes.
The Carrier is as a rule realised by an NP making reference to some entity
-a person, animal or topographic feature (tree, river, hill, etc.). However, in a300THE ClAUSEnumber of instances (under circumstances which are not as yet clear), a place is
treated as a Location for the Attribute, and the Carrier is realised by the Nominal
riwi 'country, place'. This construction is invariably used in saying that a place
is hot or cold:
(5-16) yiyili -ya
riwi
boordbara
LOC country hot
'It is hot at Yiyili', or 'Yiyili is hot'
No instances of the type yiyili boordbara 'Yiyili is hot' occur in the corpus.
However, the Carrier riwi 'country, place' may be omitted, and clauses such as
yiyiliya boordbara 'It is hot at Yiyili' do occur. I regard such clauses as elliptical,
rather than having a Locative PP as Carrier, since riwi 'country, place' may
always be added.
However, I do not suggest this explanation as valid for the following example,
which described a flower with a red centre.
(5-17) biliga thiwa
middle red
'The middle is red.'
This is for two reasons. Firstly, I know of no word which could be used to refer to
the place, the centre of a flower, in the same way as riwi 'country, place' refers to
the place in (5-16). And secondly, spatial adverbials are attested in NP roles, and
it is not unreasonable to assume that biliga 'middle' is fulfilling the role of Entity
in the first NP of (5-17).","[283, 284]"
"1.9 Other work on GooniyandiPrevious to my investigations, very little linguistic work had been done on
Gooniyandi, and there are only scattered references to the language in the
literature. (See McGregor 1984a (a copy of which has been lodged in the
A.I.A.S.library) and 1988e for lists of the major references to the language.)
The first written reference to Gooniyandi appears in Bates (nd), which is a
compilation of wordlists in languages from the Kimberley region, collected by
various local white residents around the turn of the century. This manuscript
contains a wordlist in the Warranarrie (presumably a mis-hearing of Waringaddi
'many people') language compiled by C.J. Annear. The majority of words are
clearly Gooniyandi, and on the whole they are reasonably well transcribed.
Capell (1940:416-418) gives a short list of nineteen words, all but two of
which are identifiable and reasonably accurately transcribed. He also provides a
part of the present tense paradigm of the verb ward- 'go' (Capell 1940:416).
However, most of the forms given are inaccurate: the plural marker ge (-/gil)
given for the first person non-singular forms is found in Bunuba only, and most
instances of word final/i/ have been mistranscribed as /a/ (cf. 2.1.6.1 below). ToafHER WORK ON GOONIYANDI29the best of my knowledge this is the only published data on Gooniyandi (prior
to my own work). Capell (1940:244) was the first linguist to correctly identify
Bunuba and Gooniyandi as members of a single language group, referring to
them as ""prefixing languages without noun classification"". The linguistic
surveys of O'Grady, V oegelin, and Voegelin (1966:78), Oates and Oates {1970),
and Wurm (1972) repeat Capell's remarks without adding anything new.
Worms apparently did a little field work on Gooniyandi in the thirties or
forties (Worms 1953:960). However, virtually nothing about the language
appears in Nekes and Worms' monumental Australian languages (Nekcs and
Worms 1953), and Worms wrongly typologised it as a SUFFIXING northern
Kimberley language (Worms 1953:961), despite Capell (1940).
In 1953 the anthropologist Norman Tindale collected a vocabulary of about
a hundred or so basic terms in Gooniyandi (Tindale 1952-1954). All but a couple
of his terms are readily identified, and most are reasonably accurately transcribed.
The main inaccuracy is that he misses many lamina-dental and retroflexed stops
and nasals, most of which he transcribes as apico-alveolars.
The next linguist to record Gooniyandi seems to be Father Anthony Piele,
who in about 1960 recorded, but did not transcribe, an hour or so of Gooniyandi
words.
By far the best and most extensive early work on Gooniyandi is
undoubtedly that done by the missionary-linguist Howard Coate in the mid1960s. Coate worked for a short time with the Fossil Downs ""mob""; the Kija
bias in the lexicon is evident (see section 1.3). He elicited a number of words,
and recorded and transcribed some excellent and valuable texts (totaling about
forty minutes in duration), traditional and historical, all told by a very
knowledgeable old man (Fossil Pluto), since deceased, who is still remembered
as an expertjalngangooddoo 'doctor'- i.e. person knowledgeable in traditional
Aboriginal law and ritual. Coate has generously made his material available to
me, and because of the value of the texts, I have retranscribed them, hopefully
more accurately.
Coate's transcription was quite accurate, except that (1) He did not always
distinguish the lamina-dental stop /th/ and nasal /nh/, which he usually wrote as
apico-alveolar /d/ and /n/ respectively. This distinction is, in fact, very difficult
for the English speaker to hear, and it is quite likely that there are some such
mistranscriptions in the present work. And (2) he took the mid vowels [e] and
[o], which are allophones of /if and /oo/ respectively to be distinct phonemes.
Coate undertook some grammatical analysis, but did not publish any of his
findings. His analysis is good, as far as it goes, and considering the very short30INTRODUCTIONtime he spent on the language. He correctly identified the free pronominal forms
-but he sometimes confused yaadi 'we unrestricted (=we plural inclusive)' as
'we plural exclusive' - and his verbal paradigms are reasonably accurate, though
incomplete. There are just a few unidentified forms in Coate's corpus, some of
which may perhaps be Kija: for example, mangany 'no, not' (mangaddi and
marlami in Gooniyandi), and -ningi 'to him/her/it' (-nhi in Gooniyandi).
In the mid- to late nineteen seventies two academic linguists, namely Alan
Rumsey and Tasaku Tsunoda, recorded small amounts of Gooniyandi; both have
kindly made their recordings available to me. Working with Bunuba bilinguals
in Fitzroy Crossing, Rumsey collected a short word list of around a hundred
items for the purposes of lexical comparison; Rumsey's list, of course, shows
some Bunuba influence. Tsunoda recorded four or five hours of words and
sentences at Margaret River station with speakers of the easternmost variety of
Gooniyandi (see section 1.3). This is the only material available in this
maximally divergent variety.
In the last decade two SIL linguists have been involved in more practical
work on the language. In 1978 Carol Morris, in collaboration with a speaker of
Gooniyandi who was fully literate in English, David Street, produced a short
dictionary of a few hundred entries, on the whole accurately transcribed. Morris
recognised the phonemic distinctiveness of the lamino-dentals, but, like Coate,
took the mid vowels [e] and [o] to be phonemically contrastive. And, as
mentioned in the preceding section, in 1983 Joyce Hudson produced some
Gooniyandi literacy materials, and published a few articles on the orthography
which she designed in collaboration with Street and Chestnut. Most of the words
appearing in these works are accurately written in the Hudson-Street-Chestnut
orthography, although there are a few instances of mistranscription of laminodentals as apico-alveolars, and some phonetically long, but phonemically short
vowels are mistranscribed as long.
A number of anthropological studies have at least touched on the
Gooniyandi people, and a couple of them include some Gooniyandi words (for a
list of these works, see McGregor 1984a). The most recent study is Kolig
(1981), who cites a number of identifiably Gooniyandi words; these are not
accurately transcribed. Moreover, Kolig generally does not identify these terms
as Gooniyandi, nor does he distinguish them from terms in the other languages
of the Fitzroy Crossing region.","[41, 42, 43]"
"1.2 Territory and surrounding languages
The Gooniyandi people traditionally occupied quite a large tract of land,
extending from Fitzroy Crossing in the west to the vicinity of Margaret River
Station in the east, a distance of some one hundred and fifty kilometres, west to
east. This territory abuts on the Great Sandy Desert in the south, and extends
into the King Leopold Ranges in the north. Two large rivers, the Margaret River
and Christmas Creek, as well as a number of smaller creeks, water the
countryside, which is predominantly river flats intersected by numerous
limestone ranges. The approximate extent of the Gooniyandi territory, as well as
the territories of the neighbouring peoples, is shown on Map 1 (see also Tindale
1974).
The languages spoken in the vicinity are representatives of five distinct
language families, according to O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966), and
Wurm (1972)- compare Capell (1940) and (1956/1966). Although it has more
recently been suggested that aJl Australian Aboriginal languages (with two or
three possible exceptions) belong to a single family (Dixon 1980:3), genetic
relations between these five families have not yet been conclusively
demonstrated.
Walmajarri, Jaru, and Wangkajunga, traditionally spoken to the south and
east of Gooniyandi, are the local representatives of the Pama-Nyungan family,
which covers most of the Australian continent (see e.g. map facing page 112 of
Wurm 1972). The Jarrakan (Djeragan, in older spelling) family, of which Kija is
a member, was located to the north and north-east of Gooniyandi; languages of
the Nyulnyulan family, which includes Nyikina, were spoken to the west of
Gooniyandi; the Worrorran (elsewhere spelled Wororan) languages, including
Worrorra and Ungarinyin, were spoken to the north and north-west of Bunuba,5TERRITORY AND SURROUNDING LANGUAGESINDIANWorrorraWyndhameKununurrao

(on approximately 1500 items of Stokes et a/1980)
(on Hale's 100 item list; my own field notes)The two members of the Bunuban family, Gooniyandi and Bunuba, arc
fairly close genetic relatives, and are lexically, grammatically, and typologically
quite similar. They are perhaps as similar as Italian and Spanish. There is also
quite a high degree of bilingualism in the two languages, especially among lhe
older generation of Gooniyandi and Bunuba people.
The phonological inventories of Gooniyandi and Bunuba are identical
except that Bunuba has a phonemically distinct lamina-dental lateral phoneme
/lh/ (Alan Rumsey pers.comm.), not found in Gooniyandi. Gooniyandi and
Bunuba showed a cognate density of about 45% on a 138 item list, which
included lhe 100 items of Hale's core vocabulary for Australian languages (the
words marked by double asterisks in Sutton and Walsh 1979), plus some other
starred words from an AIAS word list current as of 22/1/1975 (Rumsey
pers.comm.). A count of some of the more frequent and easily segmentable
bound morphemes (36 in number) showed a somewhat higher cognate rate of
66%. The verbal constructions in the two languages are quite similar. But
whereas in Gooniyandi the verbal complex is a minimal free form in which the
verbal stem and the classifier complex (see section 3.9.3.2) are bound to one
another, in Bunuba one of the verbal auxiliaries (which arc the Bunuba
counterparts of Gooniyandi classifiers), namely -ma, has the privilege of free
occurrence (Rumsey pers.comm.).
The Bunuban family differs in a number of typological respects from the
surrounding families. For example, unlike the Worrorran and Jarrakan families,
noun classes are not distinguished, and the nominal phrase exhibits ergative
marking. Secondly, the lamina-palatal vs. lamina-dental contrast in stops and
nasals is found in the Bunuban and Jarrakan languages, but not in the nearby
Pama-Nyungan or Nyulnyulan languages, and in only one Worrorran language,GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY7namely Unggumi (which is geographically contiguous with Bunuba).
However, the five families are by no means totally dissimilar, and there are
a number of common features shared by two or more families, or pairs of
languages from different families. A number of these similarities are fairly
certainly the result of areal diffusion; none can be said with certainty to be
retentions from putative earlier proto-languages. For example, all of the
languages shown on Map 1 have bound pronominals which cross-reference
certain actants in the clause. In the non-Pama-Nyungan languages, they are
typically prefixed to the verbal auxiliary (or classifier in the case of Gooniyandi),
while in the Pama-Nyungan languages they are suffixed to a ""catalyst"" (Capell
1956/1966: 11), or to the first word of a clause. It is also likely that at some
stage the preverb-auxiliary construction, as it may be called (following
McConvell pers.comm.), typical of most languages in the area, including the
Pama-Nyungan ones, was diffused. Such a construction is undoubtedly the
historical source of the Gooniyandi verbal complex, in which the two elements,
the preverb and the auxiliary, have fused into a single free word. Changes have
led to a reanalysis of the verbal complex into root plus classifier.
1.3 Geographical variation
A few minor geographical differences were encountered in Gooniyandi speech.
These were almost entirely lexical. In boundary regions there is usually a
slightly higher percentage of common vocabulary, shared with the neighbouring
language. For example, in the speech of the Gooniyandi people of Yiyili, which
is ncar the eastern border of their territory, a couple of words were encountered
which are shared with Kija and/or Jaru, but which are not usually heard in the
Gooniyandi speech of Fitzroy Crossing and nearby communities. One such word
is gardij- 'cut', which is shared with Kija. However, the differences are too few to
justify the identification of distinct dialects, and none are named (but cf. below).
The speakers themselves are aware of variation in their language, some of
which they attribute to regions, some to particular individuals in these regions
- but never, in my experience, to socio-linguistic factors such as formality.
The main variation perceived is lexical, but speakers are also conscious of some
minor grammatical differences,2 and of a handful of words which have two
2 For instance, on one occasion a verb form which I constructed was rejected as
proper Gooniyandi, but acknowledged as a form used by some Gooniyandi/Kija
speakers in Mulurrja. And some verb forms in the Gooniyandi word book produced
in the Yiyili School (Yiyili Aboriginal Conununity School 1983) differ from the8INTRODUCTIONslightly different phonemic representations. However, it seems that speakers are
not always strictly correct in their expressed beliefs. My observation of actual
usage showed that the variant pronunciation of ginharndi 'you know' as
ginyarndi, for instance, was not geographically determined, despite native
speakers' claims. The so called 'light' form, with the !amino-palatal nasal in the
second syllable, was found in the community in which it was claimed to be
used, but beside the 'heavy' form with the !amino-dental. Moreover, the light
form was also found in other, geographically remote, communities. It may be
that the choice is governed by other factors such as the age or linguistic
provenance of the speaker or the degree of formality of the speech situation, bm
I was unable to verify any of these possibilities.
Quite often speech differences were labeled joowarliny by native speakers of
Gooniyandi (although this term was never used to name anything which could be
unequivocally identified as a dialect). Interestingly, this term (Juwarliny in
Walmajarri orthography) is also the name of a western dialect of Walmajarri
(Hudson and Richards 1978:3). Tentatively, it would seem that the Gooniyandi
term signifies unusualness, non-standard variety (with reference to the speaker's
variety), with connotations of barbarism.","[17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
"5.6.2.2 Constituent expansion
In constituent expansion, one clause expands on some entity or place referred toby a constituent of another clause. There appear to be no constraints on
coreference between the two clauses. The entity may bear any experiential role in
either clause; indeed, it may even be a PART of a constituent of the expanding
clause.
Constituent expansion is of course the functional equivalent of relative
clauses of formal grammar. Gooniyandi has no embedded relative clauses, either
finite or non-finite. On the one hand, fmite clauses, as we have seen, are never
embedded; on the other hand, non-finite clauses, though embedded, do not
usually function to modify nominal constituents of other clauses. (The only way
non-finite clauses can do this is by indicating habitual associations of
individuals; otherwise they always connect events.)
Finite clauses expanding on constituents of other clauses do so by eitherTiffi ClAUSE436extension of elaboration. These are dealt with in order in the following
subsections.","[419, 420]"
"3. 7.2 Functions of the postpositions
The major meanings and functions of each postposition are set out in the
remainder of this section. No attempt is made to separate those uses which
correspond to significant functions within the language (such as Agent, Means,
Manner, etc.) from those which are identified merely on intuitive grounds, and
correspond to no systematic distinction made in the language (such as the
possessor relationship). Although it is my belief that ultimately the
meanings/functions of each postposition will be accountable for as
contextualisations of a single core or formal meaning (see section 6.1), the task
of specifying these formal meanings is beyond the scope of the present analysis,
and I do not attempt it here. In order to reduce repetition, the information is
given in abbreviated form, making reference to discussion and examples from
later sections.3.7.2.1 -ngga ERGative
This postposition marks clausal constituents in the following roles:
(a) the Agent, regardless of its person or number, in a clause of 'directed
action' - i.e. a transitive, middle or reflexive/reciprocal clause (see section
5.2.1.3 and examples therein).
(b) the Instrument in all clause types (section 5.2.2.3), regardless of
whether it is a body part or non-body part Instrument. (However, it should be
noted that body part Instruments are far more frequent than non-body part
Instruments - non-body parts are more often Means than Instruments; see page
343 below.)
I reject the view proposed in many grammars of Australian languages that the
instrumental as a distinct CASE from the ergative (see for instance, Tsunoda178'IHEWORD1981:5 5, Dixon 1980:306-307, and cf. Dixon 1980:299). In my view, the
evidence they cite demonstrates that there are two distinct clausal roles, Agent and
Instrument, NOT that there are distinct cases. Thus I do not distinguish, as do
many Australianist linguists, between syntactic and semantic, or core and
peripheral CASES (or case marking postpositions); I see these contrasts as relevant
only to clause level roles (see chapter 5 below, where I make similar, though not
identical, distinctions).(c) nominal expressions (NPs and PPs) realising circumstantial roles of
Means (section 5.2.3.3), Manner (section 5.2.3.4), Cause (section 5.2.3.6) and a
subset of the Accompaniment roles (see section 5.2.3.5) in clauses of directed
action.
(d) nominal expressions functioning as Attributes of Agents (section
5.2.4).
(e) non-finite VPs in the circumstantial role of Manner in clauses of
directed action, as in example (5-332); and in non-finite VPs functioning as
Attributes of the Actor (not necessarily an Agent) in any clause type- see
examples (5-278) and (5-279).
When it marks the Agent, the ergative postposition is optional except
when the Agent is inanimate, in which case it is obligatory (see page 319 below
for further discussion). In the other circumstances of its occurrence, its presence
is usually obligatory - there are just a handful of instances in which, on
repetition of the utterance, the ergative postposition was dropped from a
circumstantial expression involving -binyi PER- see section 3.7.2.8 below.
Not only does the ergative postposition sometimes not occur where
expected- that is, it fails to mark an Agent- but occasionally also it occurs
where it is not expected, in an intransitive clause. The second use of -ngga ERG
mentioned under (e) is one instance of this type. There are also examples in
which the Actor of an intransitive clause is marked with -ngga ERG. One such
example is
(3-83) yoowarni -ngga I yoowarni -ngga gardiya I Cherrabun Bore I
one
ERG one
ERG white:man
warangji I gamba I bambimnga -widdangi booloomani -yoo I
he:sat
water
he:pumped:it for:them cattle
DAT
'There was a white man at Cherrabun Bore, who was pumping
water for cattle.'
Exactly how such examples as this should be accounted for is not yet clear.
What seems to be a recurrent feature is that the following clause is transitive.
This suggests that the ERG postposition occurs in anticipation of the followingrosrrosmoNs179transitive clause, or alternatively, perhaps that the intransitive clause is an
interpolation. (Some other Australian languages display this phenomenon in
similar circumstances -see Haviland 1979:155 on Guugu Yimidhirr and
McGregor 1979:119 on Ngaanyatjara.) Useful as this explanation may be, it
does not account for the occurrence of the ergative on non-finite VPs in
intransitive clauses (as in example (5-278)).
Finally, let us remark on the shapes of the two locational terms
ngirndangaddingga 'this side (usually of a body of water)' and
ngooddoongaddingga 'that side (usually of a body of water)'. These are evidently
constructed from the determiners ngirnda 'this' and ngooddoo 'that', with the
addition of -ngaddingga, which might plausibly be analysed as the sequence
-ngaddi-ngga COMIT+ERG. If this is the case, at least as an historical
derivation of the above forms, this may (partly) account for the formal identity
of the Gooniyandi ergative postposition with one of the allomorphs of the
locative found in many Pama-Nyungan languages, and suggest an origin for the
former in a locative marker. (That the locative and ergative morphemes coincide
in some Australian languages (for instance, Mparntwe Arrernte - Wilkins in
preparation) attests to the plausibility of a historical derivation such as this.)
3.7 .2.2 -yoo --woo DATiveThe dative postposition -yoo- -woo marks units in both clause rank roles ((c),
(d) and (f) below), and phrase rank roles ((a), (b) and (e) below).
(a) Possessors, both alienable and inalienable- see example (4-11) below
- are marked by the dative, provided that the possessor is realised by a nominal
expression. Where the possessor is referred to by a pronominal, a distinct
oblique case form of that pronoun is used instead- see examples (3-72) to
(3-74) above.
(b) Attached to an oblique pronominal, -yoo DAT indicates that the referent
of the pronoun is someone or something who is not necessarily in possession of
an item, but has some access to it, to use it in certain ways, when that item is
for the benefit of the person or thing. Example:
(3-84) ngirndaji riwi mangaddi ngaddagi -yoo -miya
this
camp not
my
DAT ONboojoo -yoo -nyali
all
DAT REP
'This place is not only for me, it is for all of us.'yaddangi
our180Tim WORDThis is also a possible sense of the dative when attached to a nominal
expression, but the difference is formally apparent only when the dative is
attached to a pronominal.
It should be noted that the sense I am alluding to here is independent of
ownership: it could be that in some sense the speaker and his group do own the
place referred to in (3-84). But this possession is irrelevant. The contrast here is
not one of temporary vs. permanent ownership, or of present vs. future or
imminent ownership.(c) A nominal expression realising the Goal participant in a middle clause
(see section 5.2.1.3 and example (5-66)), or the Affected participant in a clause
of another transitivity type (see 5.2.2.1) is marked by -yoo DAT.
(d) Nominal expressions and non-finite clauses fulfilling the circumstantial
roles of Purpose (sections 5.2.3.7 and 5.5.2.4) and Matter (sections 5.2.3.8 and
5.5.2.4) are marked by the dative postposition.
(e) Within an NP also, the dative postposition may mark a qualifying
expression {either a nominal expression or a non-finite clause) which indicates
the purpose of the referent thing, or a respect in which some attribute holds of it
-see example (5-299).
(f) -Yoo OAT frequently, although not always, marks nominal and
adverbial expressions referring to future time (see below section 5.2.3.2).
As was the case with the ergative postposition, the dative postposition is
occasionally absent where its presence is expected. This occurs in circumstance
(b), where it marks the Goal or Affected participant. An example is (3-85)- see
also example (5-70).

ri ? maJa I George Rundin

I:went:up:to:him
boss
[name]
migaliminhi I
I:told:him
'That night I went to the boss, and told him, George Rundin.'
What is common across the circumstances pertaining to the omission of both
the ERG and the OAT is that the postposition is omissible if and only if the
phrase is also cross-referenced in the verb. This certainly suggests that the
presence of the postposition may have something to do with disambiguation;
however, it will be shown below (pages 319-320) that there are insurmountable
problems with this hypothesis, and that it must be rejected.","[162, 163, 164, 165]"
"3.3.5 Proper nouns
Proper nouns are names of persons or places. They invariably realise the role of
Entity in an NP; this NP may of course be embedded within another NP,
usually to indicate the possessor of the thing referred to by the second NP. There
are apparently restrictions on the realisations of other roles in phrases in which
proper nouns occur: the only other role normally filled is that of the Classifier,
as in:
(3-20} riwi ngaJhaddamany
place [p1acename]
'the place Ngathaddamany'Place names are formally distinguishable by the fact that they may occur
with both of the suffixes -wanggoo 'a person who is associated with the place'
and -waddawadda 'everyone associated with the place'. These two suffixes do not
occur in any other context Ideally, the association between the person(s) and the
place is that it is his/her/their dreaming or conception site: boolga-wanggoo
refers (ideally) to a person whose conception site is boolga (i.e. Bulga Swamp}.
However, in actual usage the association may be less stringent. It may be an
affiliation through residence, as when all of the residents of Gogo were referred
to collectively in a text as bamathidi-waddawadda, with no implication that this
place was the conception site of every individual in that community.
Alternatively, it may be an affiliation through birth, or through the patriline
Oess regularly through the matriline). Thus a single individual may on different
occasions be referred to as x-wanggoo for more than one place name x.
Personal names are used infrequently and cautiously, and one way of
avoiding their use is to refer to the individual indirectly through his or her
association with a place, usually his/her conception site or birthplace. An
individual may be referred to in this way so frequently that it becomes a sort of
nickname. This was the case for one old man, now deceased, who was usually
referred to as Malawanggoo 'person associated with Mala, having Mala as his•
ADVERBIAI..S151conception site'. For other individuals this mode of reference was not frequently
employed (at least in my presence), other modes of indirect reference being
preferred
Both place and personal names are normally unanalysable morphologically.
The only exception that has come to my attention is the place name diyadiya
bliddijgilayi '(the place where) the peewee went ""bliddij'"" .
3.4 Adverbials
Adverbials were distinguished above (see section 3.2) by. their ability to realise
clause rank roles of circumstance (including location, direction from, direction
towards, etc.). On the one hand they are distinct from nominals, which may
realise phrasal roles only, never clausal roles. On the other hand, they differ from
particles, which, while they have the property of occurring as constituents of
clauses (where they realise the role of Propositional Modifier - see section
5.4.1), do not realise circumstantial roles.
It has been suggested above that adverbials do not form phrasal units with
one another. They do however form word complexes together. The two
adverbials in clauses such as (3-21), for instance, might initially appear to fonn
a phrase, with mayaaddayaadda 'hard' modifying galjini 'fast' (i.e. 'very fast').
However, such syntagms are very rare, and there is no convincing evidence that
the relation is one of modification, rather than addition (on which see sections
4.3.1 and 5.6.2):
(3-21) mayaad:Jayaadda galjini
hard
fast
'He ran very quickly.'giddagiddayi
he:ranIn fact, as the gloss indicates, it would seem that mayaaddayaadda is better
glossed 'hard' than 'very'. (It does not occur as an intensifier of adverbials other
than those relating to speed; and secondly, it may also occur alone (i.e. without
another adverbial) in clauses of motion carrying the sense 'hard, energetically'.
Thirdly, it is obviously the partial reduplication of mayaadda, which is
segmentable into maya, an adverbial meaning 'hard, energetically' (where the
verb is not one of motion) and the suffix -wadda (on which see 5.5.1.3 below).)
For these reasons, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I assume that
such syntagms are indeed word complexes, and not phrases. A more literal
translation of (3-21) would thus be 'He ran hard and fast'.
Adverbials are as a rule mutually substitutable with PPs; but because they
have quite different ranges of meanings the two are not in complementary----------------------------------------------------------~~·~1HEWORD152distribution, and are frequently found in apposition, each adding something to
the meaning of the other. That is, adverbials and PPs form unit complexes
together (see section 4.3.2 below).
There appear to be four main types of adverbial in Gooniyandi: adverb,
temporal adverbial, spatial adverbial, and frequency adverbial. These will be
discussed in order in the subsections below.
In addition, there are two very general adverbials yiniga 'in some manner,
in what manner', and miga 'in this/that manner', which might perhaps be
regarded as indefinite and deftnite ""determiners"" respectively for adverbials. They
are not used in respect of concrete entities (for which the nominal determiners
discussed in 3.3.1 are used), but rather for types of action, including speech, and
other 'abstracts' such as qualities. For example,yiniga ngawali ngaraggmy)a
how
woomera you:make:it
A: miga
ngaragba
like:this you:make:it
Q: 'How do you make a woomera?'
A: 'You make it like this.'","[135, 136, 137]"
"We may conclude from the preceding discussion that whenever the
Location is thematic, it must constitute a separate information unit; a thematic
Existent need not. This suggests that the Location is the marked choice of
Theme; the Existent, the unmarked choice. Indeed, it would appear that the
Location is thematic only in circumstances in which it is clearly the ground
against which the existent stands as figure. The two possible choices of Theme,
Existent and Location, correspond in a natural way to two distinct types of
Theme: one is Theme as what the clause is about - most naturally the item
claimed to exist, which will be a figure; the other is Theme as starting point of
the clause - most naturally something which is given, the ground.
Despite the fact that both verbless existential clauses and locational
characterising clauses typically consist of phrasal constituents of the same class,
there is reason to distinguish them as grammatic~lly distinct types. Firstly, an
Existent always carries new information, and the denoting NP may never be
omitted, whereas a phrase referring to an entity of which a location is attributed
may be ellipsed, in case it conveys given information. The NP realising
Existent may not have a deictic element since the presence of a deictic indicates
that the NP is definite, and is compatible only with presumed existence of the
entity. Secondly, the Location is inherent to locational characterising clauses,
but (as we have seen) not to existential clauses. Thirdly, the order of the
Location and Existent is more variable than is the order of Location and Carrier
(in characterising clauses). In characterising clauses, because the entity isi'I':!ITHE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION307normally given, and hence likely to be both what the clause is about and the
starting point of the utterance, the Location occurs clause initially very
infrequently. The greater variability in existential clauses may be attributed to
the conflict between the Existent as what the clause is about, and the Location
as the natural choice of starting point Theme. Fourthly, although both clause
types have situation clause agnates, the contrast between the relational and the
situation clauses contextualises in different ways in each. And finally, as a
consequence of the way in which the contrast contextualises, locational
characterising clauses are far rarer than their situation clause agnates; this
statistical tendency does not hold for existential clauses.
As we can see from the examples given in this section, Gooniyandi
verbless existential clauses frequently translate into 'there is' clauses of English.
But there are occasions where this translation is inappropriate, as example (5-33)
illustrates. The difference is that existential clauses in Gooniyandi, unlike their
counterparts in English, as a rule function to draw attention to an entity, or
present it into the hearer's consciousness. They are not used merely or
exclusively to assert existence in the abstract, outside of the context of a
particular speech situation or referent situation.
5.2.1.2 Situation clauses (a): modes of being
5.2.1.2.1 Attributive modes
There is a class of situation clauses which have an inherent Attribute, in addition
to a single inherent participant and an inherent Process. These I will refer to as
clauses (or situations) of being, for reasons that will become apparent shortly.
The inherent participant is an Actor/Medium (see below page 323), and this
participant is usually the Carrier, the thing which bears the Attribute, as in the
following example.
Carrier:

give an approximate idea of their main meanings. It is beyond the scope of the

'At Goobardiya there was no house; there was only a yard.'
Sometimes posture is irrelevant or secondary - for instance, when the
Existent is abstract and intangible, or when it is tangible but has no particular or
invariant posture. In such cases, one of the two verbs warang- 'sit' and bagi- 'lie'
occurs. Warang- 'sit' is normally used of things that are typically relatively
active, especially people (see example (5-50).) (It should be noted that there is
no suggestion here that people used to do nothing but sit around.) On the other
hand, bagi- 'lie' is used where the thing is quite inactive. Examples (5-52) and
(5-53) illustrate this:

Verbal existential clauses do not always assert that an entity not previously
known about exists. They also occur in circumstances where the existence of an
entity is taken for granted, but some facet of its existence is new, the result of a
situation, or of a process of change. The two examples I have available involve
the only two logical possibilities: change in an essential quality, and change in
number, respectively:

'I'm nearly finished (my cassettes), there are three left.'
Natural translations of these examples would involve 'there results' and 'there
remains', rather than 'there is' or 'there exists'.
Two strong generalisations may be made regarding the order of
constituents. The strongest is that the verbal complex almost always comes1HE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION315finally, as an examination of the examples of this section will reveal. Only
slightly weaker is the tendency, demonstrated by nearly all examples in this
section, for the phrase referring to the Location to precede the phrase referring to

Existent""Location.
·
(5-56) gamba joomoo laandi bagiri I
water soak
up
it:lies
'There's soak water up there.'
The semantic difference between the two types of existential clauses is as
follows. As mentioned in section 5.2.1.2.1 the non-situational existential clause
draws attention to~ or establishes the Existent. This is a possible means of
introducing a primary participant into a narrative text - for example, one text
concerning a particular young man began:
(5-57) yoowarni boolga I mar/ami boolga I yanoonggoo -nyali
one
old:man not
old:man young
REP
yoowooloo I
man
'There was an old man, not really an old man, he was still young.'
By contrast, existential situation clauses do not assert or establish an Existent,
or draw attention to one. They typically describe backgrounded situations within
the text. For example, (5-51) described the place Goobardiya, and the situation
referred to was not central to the unfolding of the narrative, and neither was the
house or yard an important participant- neither is mentioned subsequently.
Thus we see again the contrast between situation clauses and their relational
clause agnates, the former describing some phenomenon of experience, the latter
asserting a logical relationship. If identification corresponds to .the logical
""equals"" (=), and characterisation to predication with a single variable (P(x)),
then the existential relation in non-situation clauses corresponds to the logical
operator ""there exists"" (3).
Existential clauses must be distinguished from two other types of verbal clauses
which share overlapping classes of realisations. They ·are locational attributive
clauses (section 5.2.1.2.1), and clauses of inhabitation (section 5.2.1.2.3). The
former attribute a location of an entity; the latter indicate a niche which it
inhabits. The three types typically consist of an NP referring to an entity, a
locational element referring to a place, and a verbal complex with one of the three
ver?s of stance. Not only do these types differ in terms of their extra-linguistic
l?g1cal or referential meaning, but there are grammatical differences between them.
(1) The existential type involves only two inherent roles, the Existent and the;'~
I' i, r,·.
• !Ii!","[298, 299, 300]"
"As example (5-32) suggests, existential clauses typically consist of two
roles: a Spatial Location, realised by a LOC PP or a locational adverbial, or a
complex of Locative PP and locational adverbial (as in (5-32)); and an Existent,
realised by an NP. Only the Existent role is inherent. The Location, though
frequently present, is not inherent, as shown by (5-57) and
(5-33) nya I girla/a ngaanggi I

tobacco yours
'Here! (This is) tobacco for you'
An existential clause sometimes has in addition to a Spatial Location, a
Temporal Location. However, it seems that there can never be just a Temporal
Location and an Existent. In the few examples available which consist of just
these two elements, there is evidence that a verbal complex has also been
ellipsed, being Given.
The Location and Existent phrases may come in any order, and the two
possible orders are approximately equally frequent in the examples available.
However, when the locational constituent occurs first, the two phrases always
(in the examples available) occur in different tone units. There is always a hiatus
at their boundary, and a slight rise in pitch on the final syllable of that phrase.
The phrase referring to the Existent then has falling pitch, with the final stressed
syllable the most salient. But when the Existent precedes the Location, the
clause frequently consists of only one tone unit. As far as I can ascertain, this306THE CLAUSEunit always has a falling tone, with the greatest phonological salience going to
the final stressed syllable of the unit. The two phrases may, however, constitute
distinct tone units; if so, each will have falling tone. Furthermore, the second
tone unit will normally have lower pitch than the first. Typical examples of
each possibility are, respectively, the following clauses:

and the classifier +I, although it is not possible in this case to uniquely segment
the form- see section 3.9.3.2.4 below.)
The intermediate ranks of phrase and word have been introduced in order to
account for the possibility of branching: in Figure 3-2, in each case in which a131PREUMINARY REMARKSnode is marked (except for the terminal nodes), there is either a branch, or
branching is possible at that point. That is, the function that this constituent
has is realised, or could be realised by a unit with internal structure. (Other
changes - e.g. to the person/number ""agreement"" in the verbal complex may be necessary to preserve grammaticality.) For example, the word waba'smell' in (3-1) realises the function of Process in the phrase of which it is a
constituent, and this may be realised by bimorphemic constructions such as
gard-bi- (hit-IT) 'belt'.
There are, however, certain linguistic units that cannot be placed on the
rank scale. This includes a number of words which may occur directly as
constituents of clauses, and a number of morphemes which occur as phrasal
constituents, without intervening phrase and word nodes respectively. This holds
true for the word mangaddi 'not' in example (3-3), and the morphemes -yooddoo
DU and -jidda ALL in (3-2), and -ngga ERG in (3-3), as is shown in the
constituent analyses of figures 3-3 and 3-4.

-Yooddoo DU and -jidda ALL in Figure 3-2, and -ngga ERG in Figures 3-3
and 3-4, have bypassed the word level, while mangaddi 'not' in Figure 3-3 has
bypassed both phrase and word levels. This is because in these instances there is
no possibility of branching between the morpheme level and the next one up:
these morphemes do not enter into syntagms with other morphemes, to form
grammatical words. Because of this, I do not refer to forms such as mangaddi
'not', even though they are free forms, as grammatical words (see also below
section 3.1.2).
We have now identified two types of unit: ranking and non-ranking. It
turns out that, in Gooniyandi, all form items (Matthews 1981:59) are nonranking, and conversely, the majority of non-ranking units are form items. The
only exceptions are the adverbials, which are non-ranking units (section 3.2),
but are not form items. With the exception of adverbials, all non-ranking units
are form items, and must occur in construction with ranking units. The resulting
syntagm is typically a unit of the same rank as the ranking unit (as is the case
in the preceding two examples above) - although sometimes it does not
constitute a unit at all (see below section 3.8).
One further qualification is necessary: certain clauses may consist only of a
single morpheme, usually an interjection - e.g. yoowayi 'yes' (see below
3.10). Evidently these are ""minor"" clauses, and might reasonably be placed off
the rank scale: they never have internal structure. In this case ""clause"" and
""morpheme"" coincide.
There are two main ways in which trees can become more complicated.
Firstly, as Figures 3-3 and 3-4 show, embedding is possible. In these particular
examples the embedded unit is of the same rank as the unit it is embedded in.
However, rankshifting (Huddleston 1965:45) - which is a special type ofPRELIMINARY REMARKS133embedding in which the unit embedded is of higher rank than the unit in which
it is embedded - is also possible, albeit rare and of limited productivity in
Gooniyandi (see below 4.1.2.1 and 5.5). The maximum depth of embedding
attested in my corpus is three, as in the following configuration:
PPA pNPA (N)ppA
NP1P1Here NP 1 cannot have another phrase embedded within it (see section 4.2).
Furthermore, when the embedding also involves rankshifting, the maximum
depth appears to be one: if a unit of higher rank is embedded under a unit of
lower rank, then no unit can be embedded within the embedded unit
The second complication is that units (typically of the same rank) may
form syntagms that are not units of the next highest rank. For instance,
(3-4) garndiwiddi yoowooloo yoowarni goornboo
two
man
one
woman
'two men and one woman'consists of two phrases, [garndiwiddi yoowooloo] 'two men' and [yoowarni
goornboo] 'one woman', each of which has the characteristic structure of an NP.
The structure of the whole is clearly not that of an NP - it cannot be described
in terms of the functions identified for the NP (see section 4.1.2.1), although its
two constituents can be. Neither is it a clause. Constructions such as these will
be referred to as complexes, following Huddleston (1965). There are, in
Gooniyandi, word complexes, phrase complexes and clause complexes; in
addition, certain complexes of words and phrases occur. (It is also possible that
there are morpheme complexes.)3.1.2Types of wordIt is necessary to distinguish four different types of word in Gooniyandi. Firstly
there is the phonological word, which is as described in the previous chapter. A
second type of word is the grammatical word- abbreviated g-word- which is
a grammatical unit of word rank; that is, it is the smallest unit that can have
constituency structure. This unit was introduced in the previous subsection.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"

irregular in terms of the construction of the pronominal configuration, which
also varies according to whether it occurs with the present or future tense prefix.

instances {bini} replaces the expected {boo}. These appear to be irregularities,
and I do not attempt to explain them. Instead, the occurring forms are tabulated

apparently in free variation. For example,

variants, but there is no evidence at all that they differ in representational
(experiential) meaning.
Only one of the rules mentioned above, namely (4), CCR9, also applies to
{boo}, and it does so in similar grammatical environments. (2) (i.e. CCR7) is
prevented from applying by the choice of the oo allomorph following dd; (3)
(i.e. CCR4) can apply only to {bini}; and (1) (VR2) cannot apply since there is
always at least an intervening tense morpheme between {boo} and the verb root.
The following example illustrates the operation of rule CCR9 in conditions as
specified for (4) above:

~ /gardginggoowoo/-woo}'he's hitting you'DEFThe function of the classifiers is to indicate the type of process that is
referred to. They cJassify the lexical words (which realise the VP role Process in
Fl) with which they occur, thereby modifying their significance. Classifiers do
not divide the set of verballexemes into disjoint subsets. Most verbal lexemes
collocate with more than one classifier, and the choice between these classifiers
distinguishes among various process types that may be referred to by the same
lexical item. The processes differ in terms of the meaning features set out in the
second and third columns of Table 3-7 (see also section 6.5.5).
The classifiers numbered (I) to (5), (9) and (IO) may occur with
pronominal prefix configurations referring to two actants in the referent
situation. However, all of them except (apparently) for +ADDI may occur with a
single pronominal prefix, which makes reference to a single actant. On the other
hand, those classifiers numbered (6) to (8), (II) and (12) may occur with only
one pronominal prefix. I will refer to them as monovalent rather than
intransitive, since they can occur in some clauses of 'directed action' (see section
5.2.I.3).
At the least 'delicate' level, classifiers may be divided into two groups: (a)
those which classify the process as an ACCOMPUSHMENT; and (b) those which
classify it as EXTENDIBLE. +I is the only exception: it usually indicates
extendibles, but in certain well defined circumstances it can refer to
accomplishments, as will be mentioned below. As I use the term here,
'accomplishment' refers to any process for which there is an inherent point at2021HEWORDwhich it is actualised, before which it has not yet occurred, and after which it has
occurred, and is completed. Examples are processes such as 'hit', 'arrive'. 'die',
etc •. Accomplishments often have 'trains' of circumstances leading up to their
point of actualisation, such as for example the nearing of the destination in the
process 'arrive'. But, until the point of actualisation is reached, the process
cannot truthfully be said to have occurred. After the point has been reached, the
process in usually completed, and may then be truthfully described in a clause in
the past tense. By 'extendible' I mean processes without such points of
completion: once started, they can (at least in principle) continue on indefinitely.
Examples include processes such as 'walk'. 'sit', 'see', 'carry', etc .. There is no
inherent point of accomplishment for processes like these.
Other meanings, very roughly glossed in the final column of Table 3-7 can
be attributed to the individual classifiers. These will be discussed in more detail
in section 6.5.5. A few further remarks may be in order here, for the reader's
orientation.
Many more subdivisions are made within accomplishments than
extendibles, of which there are only three subtypes, which very broadly
correspond to the trichotomy transitive (+A), intransitive (+I) and
reflexive/reciprocal (+ARNI:z). However, the importance of the major division
accomplishment/extendible can be seen from the fact that all distinctions other
than this one are neutralised in the reflexive/reciprocal.
It is tempting to analyse· the -rni in +ARNI2 and +MARNI as a
reflexive/reciprocal suffix to the two classifiers +A and +MI. However, +ARNI2
chooses different allomorphs of the first person singular to +A, and has an
irregular third person singular. And +MARNI cannot be regarded as consisting of
the (mad allomorph of +MI, since (i) the first vowel of +MARNI does not
harmonise with the vowel of the preceding syllable, and (ii) rule CCR13 cannot
be modified to give /a/ as the realisation of (a1 } preceding rn, since this does not
occur when the /rn/ belongs to the potential mode -rni (see below section
3.9.3.5). A special allomorph {rna}, occurring only before the
reflexive/reciprocal -rni would need to be proposed in order to account for the
occurring forms. The same problem would arise for the suggestion that +ARNI2
should be segmented into +I+rni. For all of these reasons, I regard +ARNI2 and
+MARNI as distinct classifiers.
+BINDI is much more restricted in behaviour than the other classifiers. It
occurs only with pronominal prefixes of singular number; the corresponding
plurals occur with the classifier +L For example, nyamaniloondi (from
{nyamani-li+bindi} (big-(lsg)N+BINDI)) 'I grew big', but nyamaniwiddi (from203THE VERB PHRASE{nyamani-bidd+i} (big-(3pl)N+I)) 'they grew big', or 'they are big'. Furthermore,
+BINDI explicitly refers to the point of accomplishment of the process. and so
is never found with the progressive aspect. Reference to the train of events
leading up to the accomplishment must be made through use of the classifier +I,.
as in nyamaniwangi (from {nyamani-wa-ng+i} (big-PROG+(lsg)N+I)) 'I was
getting big'. It is probably also for this reason that +BINDI is almost never
found in commands, or other uses of language aimed at modifying the behaviour
of the hearer, in all of which cases +I is again favoured. (This is presumablY
because the focus of commands is no engagement in the process over its
completion.) Example:

"3.9.3.6 Oblique bound pronominals
The oblique bound pronominals are encliticised forms of the oblique 'case' forms
of the personal pronominals (discussed in section 3.6 above). They refer to
Affected participants in most clause types, and to the Goal in Middle clauses (see
section 5.2.1.3 for details and examples). These pronominals are obligatory in
VPs in all Middle clauses, and in all clauses with Affected participants. They are
given in Table 3-13 (compare Table 3-6).

-widdangiRemarks on Table 3-13:
(i) As an inspection of this table will reveal, the final syllable of the first person
singular form may (optionally) be elided: both wardbiringaddagi and
wardbiringadda (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(lsg)O) 'come to me' occur, apparently in free
variation.(ii) The third person non-singular has the invariant form /widdangi/. Since this
enclitic always follows a vowel, and bears initial stress, it could be written
morphophonemically as either (widdangi} or (biddangi). the latter being the
phonological form of the corresponding free pronominal. I will, however,
represent it here in the least abstract way, as ( widdangi}.
(iii) The third person singular enclitic shows slightly more divergence than do
the other enclitics from its corresponding free form pronominal, nhoowoo. In
addition to the monosyllabic {nhi}, I have postulated a second (and unusual)
allommph, {wanhi). The reason for this is to explain a range of forms involving
the classifiers +I. +DI and +MI in the non-past tenses, where the allomorphsTHE VERB PHRASE225{ad, {dad, and {mad occur. Consider forms such as the following:
/wardbiraanhi/ (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(3sg)O) 'go up to him' and /jagjawilimaanhi/
(speak-SUBJ-FUT+(lsg)N+MI-(3sg)O) 'I'll speak to him'. Preceding the other
oblique pronominals, the final vowel of the CC is the expected one, namely /i/
- cf. /wardbiriwiddangi/ (go-FUT/(2sg)N/I-(3pl)O) 'go up to them', and
/jagjawilimiwiddangi/ (speak-SUBJ -FUT+(1 sg)N+Ml-(3pl)O) 'I'll speak to
them'. The easiest way of accounting for these alternations would seem to be to
assume that the third person singular pronominal has the allomorph {wanhi}
when it follows {at}; then the long vowel/aa/ (as in the examples above) would
be derived by VR5.
There is a further, exceptional, pronominal enclitic, -ngangi, not shown in
the table. This pronominal is infrequently used in reference to the speaker-hearer
dyad - i.e. it is a dual inclusive form of the first person -in either an Affected
or Goal function (regardless of clause type). When referring to the Goal in a
transitive clause -ngangi further qualifies the reference of the Accusative
pronominal in the CC (see above 3.9.3.2.2), much in the manner of a number
enclitic. For example, in /milayinangangi/ (see-(IR)N+A-(ldl)O) 'he saw me and
you', the Goal is referred to in the CC by the ACC prefix +jin+ (lR)A, and byngangi in addition. The latter restricts the possible reference of the former to just
the speaker and the hearer. Here, -ngangi is in complementary distribution with
the dual number enclitic, which may refer only to a first person dual exclusive
participant (see next section). Elsewhere -ngangi occurs in place of -ngiddangi.
These two morphemes are not, however, in complementary distribution; they
occur in contrastive variation. Both wardjingangi (go-(3sg)N+I-(ldi)O) 'he came
up to me and you' and wardjingiddangi (go-(3sg)N+I-(1R)O) 'he came up to us
(R)' occur, and the former is more explicit in its reference than the latter.
-Ngangi has not been encountered followed by a number enclitic, nor in
sequence with one of the oblique pronominals, so it is. not perfectly clear to
which order-class it belongs (or whether an additional one should be set up).
3.9.3.7 Number encliticsA single number marking enclitic, specifying either 'dual' (indicating two), or
'paucal' (indicating a few), can optionally occur in final position of any VP in
which at least one bound pronominal (either a prefix to the CC or an oblique
enclitic) is of non-singular number. This pronominal can modify ANY ONE of
the up to three non-singular pronominals that may occur in a finite VP. In case
there is more than one such non-singular category, the question immediately2261HEWORDarises as to which one the number enclitic applies to. I am unable to provide a ·
categorical answer to this question. Moreover, I doubt seriously whether there is
one: it seems likely that an answer will only be possible if discourse factors are
taken into account.
The general statement made in the previous paragraph requires some
qualification. Non-singular categories of the second and third person may be
modified by either the dual or the paucal enclitic. But in the first person nonsingular things are a little more complicated. As might be expected, the dual
will not (normally) apply to the unrestricted category (and there are no such
examples), to which only the paucal can apply. Both the dual and the paucal
may modify the first person restricted category, but the dual is used only in
reference to a pair one of which is the speaker, and the other is a third person
(and never the hearer). If the restricted category refers to the speaker and hearer
pair, it cannot be modified by the dual enclitic. That is, a form such as
milayiddayi (see-(lR)N+A-du) can only mean 'we two (exclusive of the hearer)
saw him'; it cannot mean 'we two (including the hearer) saw him'. (As
mentioned in the previous section, the irregular form -ngangi 'we two inclusive'
could be used in place of -yi, and refer to the speaker and hearer pair; but this
only when they fill the roles of Goal or Affected. -Ngangi may not be used in a
VP with a meaning such as 'we two inclusive saw him'.)
The number enclitics have the following allomorphs:
-yi ~ -yoo
-ddi- -ddoo - -waddi'dual' (du)
'paucal' (pa)The first allomorph in each case seems to be the most frequent variant,
occurring following /i/ or /a/, while the second allomorph usually follows /oo/.
Some examples are: ward-biddi-yi (go-(3pl)N+I-du) 'they went', ward-gooddooyoo (go-PRES+(3pi)N+A-du) 'they (two) go', ngab-jidda-yi (eat-(lR)N+A-du)
'we two (exclusive) ate', mila-winbidda-ddi (see-FUT+(lsg)N+(3pl)A+A-pa)
'they (few) will see me'. miga-limi-widdangi-yi (say-(lsg)N+MI-(3pl)O-du) 'I
told them two', miga-winmi-ngaddagi-yi (say-(3pl)N+MI-(Isg)O-du) 'they two
told me'.
The third allomorph of the paucal number enclitic, -waddi, occurs in
exactly the same circumstances as does the allomorph -wanhi of the third person
singular oblique bound pronominal, namely in the environment of non-past
tense forms of the classifiers +I, +DI and +MI- i.e. following {a 1 ). Examples:

The structure of the VP may be summarised in the following terms. The VP
consists of two obligatory grammatical words, which are mutually bound to, and
modify, one another, and which occur in a fixed order. This order reflects a
progression from specific to general, in terms of the lexical content, and at the
same time, somewhat paradoxically, a progression from the item that is least
specific and individuating in terms of pinning down the process to the referent
world, to the most specific and individuating, the item which refers to the actual
occurrence of the process. The position of enclitics in the VP is now explicable.
Aspect and Mood are ways of viewing the Process or predicate itself, as a whole;
they are not concerned with the actual fact of the occurrence of the Process. For
example, the progressive is concerned with the occurrence of a train of events
leading up to the culmination of the process, rather than to a process emerging
into instantiation; repetition (realised by -nyali REP) refers to repetition of a
Process, with or without the same participants, not to the repetition of an
instantiation of a process. On the other hand, the categories labelled Mode
concern the occurrence and actualisation of a process; it is the enactment of the
process that is seen as desirable, definite, or potential. Enclitics attach to the gwords on which their primary focus falls: the lexical stem in the case of
Aspectual and Mood markers, and the CC in case of Mode, pronominal and
number markers.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"
"•, Ii'THE CLAUSEThere are two main possibilities: the action may be directed out from the
Agent to some (conceptually) distinct entity, or it may be directed back on itself,
from the Agent back to the same entity. In the latter instance, there are two
further possibilities: either the activity is directed from each single entity
constituting the (set of) Agent(s) back on to itself (giving the reflexive sense),
or it is directed among the entities constituting the (set of) Agent(s) if this has
more than one member. Only one inherent participant role is involved in this
process type, the Agent himself/herself, and the Process (realised by the VP) is
explicitly marked as directed back on itself by the choice of one of the two
classifiers +ARNI2 and +MARNI.
In case the action is directed from the Agent to a conceptually distinct
Goal, there are two possibilities: the clause may be transitive or middle. The
difference between these two modes concerns the relation that the Goal bears to
the process. In transitive clauses the Goal is an essential feature in the
actualisation of the process, and the action must extend to and reach it, in order
to be effected. Of course I do not mean to suggest that there must be some actual
physical connection between the Agent and the Goal. What I am saying is that
the 'transfer' of action must be completed. This transfer is clear enough in
processes such as gard- 'hit', galiny- 'carry', gaj- 'cut', gajgaj- 'chop', and other
such ""material"" processes, which are clearly actualised through the Goal. (If the
Goal is missed, the process goes unactualised.) But the same also holds for
processes of perception and cognition, such as mila- 'see, look at', danymili'hear, listen to', lingi- 'think about', etc.: the Goal must be actually perceived in
order for the transitive process to be actualised.
On the other hand, middle clauses refer to processes in which the Goal need
not be reached in order for the process to be achieved. Typical middle clauses
include such processes as nyimij- 'wink at', jijag- talk to, miga- 'tell to',
nyamnyam- 'whisper to', yiniga- 'do something to', moow- 'search for', etc .. In
all of these cases the Goal need not be reached in order for the process to be
effected: the person winked at, spoken to, etc. need not receive the
communication; the person sought after need not be found, and so on.
The differences between the two possibilities may be more accurately
described in the following terms. In the transitive mode the Goal is a MEDIUM
- that is, as above, it is something through which the process is actualised and
enacted. In the middle mode, the Goal is instead implicated or involved in the
process, as something towards which the action is directed, but not something
through which the process must be actualised. In a few cases there are minimal
pairs for this distinction. (5-65) and (5-66) are examples involving mila· 'see',THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION325which in the transitive mode requires that the process be actualised through the
thing perceived, but which in the middle mode does not require actualisation.
Other minimal pairs can be found, and more particularly, every type (b)
transitive clause (see page 319 above) is agnate with a middle clause. The
Medium/Goal of the former corresponds with the non-Medium/Goal of the latter:III(5-70) nganyi -ngga boolja I tlrldda thoolnglimi -nhi

PRONOMINALS1673.6 Pronominals
The category of person is realised in a number of different places and ways in the
grammar of Gooniyandi. Within the VP it is realised by bound morphemes,
which occur either as prefixes to the classifier complex, or as enclitics to the
entire verb phrase (see section 3.9.3.6). Elsewhere, it is realised by free words,
and in a set of two possessive suffixes to kin-tenus (see section 3.12.2.1). With
two minor exceptions (see pages 225 and 234 below) the system is constant
throughout, distinguishing three persons (first, second and third), two numbers
(singular and non-singular) and what I will refer to as a restricted/unrestricted
opposition in the first person non-singular.
The restricted category in the first person non-singular encompasses the
traditional categories of first person dual inclusive, dual exclusive, and plural
exclusive, whilst the unrestricted category corresponds to the first person plural
inclusive. In other words, the inclusive/exclusive distinction is maintained only
in the plural; it disappears in the dual. The unrestricted category always includes
the speaker, the hearer, and at least one other person; the restricted category
excludes one of the non-speakers. Using the symbolism S =speaker, H = hearer,
and 0 = other(s), and assuming that S and H can refer to a single individual
only, while 0 may refer to any number of others, the restricted and unrestricted
categories may be distinguished as follows:
Restricted
UnrestrictedsH0+
+a-a++where a can be either+ or-, -a having the reverse polarity. Equivalently, we
could describe the restricted category as S & (H v 0), where 'v' signifies
disjunctive or; and the unrestricted category as S & H & 0.
To the best of my knowledge, pronominal systems resembling the Gooniyandi
one have not been reported in any other language, from Australia or elsewhere.
Among the neighbouring languages, those from the Pama-Nyungan family which includes Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:85), Jaru (Tsunoda 1981:64ff), and
Wangkajunga (my own fieldnotes)- and the Worrorran family- e.g. Ungarinyin
(Rumsey 1982b:31) - make the usual inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first
person non-singular. In the Jarrakan languages Kija (my fieldnotes) and
Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:47), this distinction is at least optional. However, all of
the languages of the Nyulnyulan family (traditionally located to the west of
Gooniyandi and Bunuba) show a quite different system, which distinguishes four
persons 1, 1/2, 2, and 3, and, depending on the language, two or three numbers,
minimal, augmented and, where three numbers are distinguished, unit augmented
(Stokes 1982:151ff).","[151, 152]"
