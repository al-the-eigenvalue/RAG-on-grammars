In Barbarenho, a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has
a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure. Most clauses have at most one full
NP, however (Ono 1996). The verb-initial word order occurs in independent
clauses as well as dependent clauses, such as complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses. Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and
are typically not part of the clause that follows. Usually these NPs are set off
by topic or focus particles. Finally, nominalized clauses are common in
Chumash languages. These may occur as subject or object complements,
relative clauses, part of cleft constructions, or as free NPs.
The following topics are treated in 2.3: basic clause structure (2.3.1),
two-verb predicates (2.3.2), the morphosyntax of nominalized clauses (2.3.3),
pragmatically-marked constructions (2.3.4), complement-taking predicates and
their complement clauses (2.3.5), relative clauses (2.3.6), and appositive
clauses (2.3.7). The chapter ends with examples of coordination in 2.3.8.
2.3.1Basic clause structureThe Barbareno clause is typically verb-initial, though the verb may be
preceded by modifiers, conjunctions and cliticized connectives. The clause may
or may not have full NP arguments and oblique adjuncts. If there is more than
one full NP within the clause, then the following orders normally prevail:
objects precede subjects, objects that are not semantic patients precede
objects (ones that are semantic patients) and subjects. All core arguments
precede non-core NPs. Syntactically-dependent constituents within the clause
are typically marked with the proclitic hi=. Following are examples of various
constituent orders.

"Florentino wd [<would>] say: Los indios son como osos. No contestan cuando
comiendo. El oso tiene los ojos colorados. [< Indians are like bears. They don’t answer
when they’re eating. The bear has red eyes.>]'The temporal clause above serves only to give more information about its
main clause. It continues tracking the referent Lucrecia, first introduced in line
b. The temporal clause has to be postposed because, if it were preposed, the
third person subject prefix s- (in the temporal clause) would be referring to
Florentino, the topicalized NP in line a., instead of Lucrecia, the object NP inline b. (It will be recalled that pronouns in Chumash languages do not
distinguish gender.) Thus if the order of the adverbial clause were changed,
the meaning would change to:
303*' Florentino, when he was eating, he used to ask Lucrecia things. 'A similar scenario is seen in the excerpt in (35), where a full object NP
in the main clause (line d.) is coded as the subject of the following temporal
clause (line e.). In this case, however, the object NP,a woman named Soledad,was previously mentioned in a topicalized NP (line a.).

Nominalization is a salient feature of the syntax of Chumash languages.
Nominalized clauses commonly serve as subject or object arguments. They are
also often found in relativization, apposition, and in cleft constructions. In this
section I give an overview of the basic structure of a nominalized clause in
Barbareno Chumash. The structure of nominalized clauses in this language is
sensitive to the distinction between third person subjects and first- or second
person subjects. Nominalized clauses with third person subjects are discussed
first, in 2.3.3.1, since the majority of nominalized clauses in my corpus have
third person subjects. Nominalized clauses with first- or second person subjects
are discussed afterward in 2.3.3.2.
2.3.3.1Nominalized clauses with third person subjectsIn typical nominalized clauses with third person singular subjects, the
article 1= replaces the third person pronoun s- on the verb. An illustration
of this difference is seen with the pair of clauses in (265). In line a. the verb
yinéi 'to be hot' appears in an elicited, finite independent clause. In (265)
line b. it appears in a nominalized clause that serves as the object argument
of the main verb iSmax 'to throw at'. The verb yinéi 'to be hot' has the
third person subject prefix sin the independent clause, but in the
nominalized clause it has only the article 1=, along with the proclitic hi=
which links dependent constituents to the head.

"P=DIS=ART=arrowand use it for poisoning arrows. '
<and use it to spread on the tip of the arrow.>If the adverbial clause in d. were preposed, one would not know who or what
was being referred to as the subject of xuwil-2 'be really angry' until the
introduction of the full NP 'a frog' in the main clause. The attested order in
the text allows the listener to understand immediately who or what is really
angry, and thus it makes for quicker, unambiguous processing of the
information in the adverbial clause.
A similar situation is found in the adverbial construction in (27) (lines
c. and d.). The main clause introduces a full object NP, 'the mother-to-be',
which is then coded as a third person subject in the adverbial clause, 'if/when
she gets nauseated '.

"I have been privileged to know and count as friends many of the past
and present graduate students in the department of linguistics at UCSB. I
have learned much from them, and am grateful for the pillars of moral
Support that they have been during the years of my graduate study.
I wish to thank the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History for
kindly providing the microfilms of J. P. Harrington’s manuscript materials as
well as Madison Beeler’s original manuscripts, thereby making this study
possible.
.
My earlier research on Barbareho Chumash was funded by gran
BNS90-11018 from the National Science Foundation (Marianne Mithun,
principal investigator). My M.A. thesis was part of that earlier research. I want
to thank Graeme Langley, whose moral support helped me get through that
very difficult time and move on to the next phase of my graduate study.
I am grateful for the heip and kind words i have received over the
years from Leanne Hinton, Martha Macri, Catherine Callaghan, Robert
Oswalt, Sally McLendon, Victor Golla and Margaret Langdon. Their belief in
the worth of my work on Miwok and Chumash languages has helped me find
the strength and resolve to continue doing it.
Of all my teachers and mentors I am especially indebted to Mr.
Domingo Ramirez, who was my 9th grade social studies teacher at SequoiaJunior High School. He apparently felt that I needed a greater challenge, so
he arranged for me to be put into classes for gifted/talented students when I
entered high school. Thanks to his initiative, I was put into the company of
kids who had high expectations for their futures, kids who not only took it for
granted that they would go to a four-year university, but that they would also
go on to earn doctoral degrees. That environment greatly expanded my view
of what I could do and be in this world. It was a precious gift for which I am
forever grateful.
Finally, I would like to express my thanks to some truly special people
in my life, people whose love, friendship, and support continue to make all the
difference in the world:To my parents, for believing in me and in my dreams. I thank them
also for the financial help and other material support they have generously
given during my years of graduate study.
To my sister and brother-in-law, for always wishing me well. I am also
grateful for their kids, whose entrance into this world has added a precious
dimension to my life.
To my boyfriend, Lawrence Morgan, for being extraordinarily loving
and supportive in countless ways.
To Steven Fincke, Robert Englebretson, Elisa Kamimoto, and Mary &Vern LeFever, for their priceless friendship and moral support over the
years.
Lastly, I give deepest thanks to God for all that I have and for all that
I am able to accomplish, including finally finishing this dissertation. ©VITA

Adverbial Clauses in BarbarehoChumash Narrative DiscourseBy
Suzanne WashThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionallyoriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clausescodetemporal,conditional,concessive,purposive,reason/causal,manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similaritiesanddifferencesinstructure,extentofscope,andpunctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study withthe closing remarks in Part V.,

Introduction1.1 Purpose of this studyThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.
1.2 Geographic and linguistic affiliation of the Barbareno Chumash language
Barbareno belongs to the Chumashan family of languages. The original
territory of the Chumash people extends along the California coast from a
little beyond San Luis Obispo in the north down to Malibu in the south. It
extends inland, bordering the San Joaquin valley. It also includes the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands, three of which were inhabited year around: Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel. The Barbareho language itself was spoken
in the present-day Santa Barbara county, roughly in an area from Refugio
Beach to Carpinteria. The last known speaker of Barbareho was Mary Yee,
who died in 1965.
The word Chumash originates from ehumas ‘islander', a term used
by mainlanders. However, if the word &uma is derived from the same root
as the Barbareno word 2anéum ‘money; shell bead money', as I believe
2it is,’ then the original meaning of the word éhumas has more to do with the
fact that the islanders were the producers of money. The ancestors of the
present-day Chumash had a market economy long before the Europeans
arrived, They used precisely-measured strings of shell-bead money as their
currency. The islanders produced this currency for export and trade to the
mainland. The islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel were mints
in the literal sense of the word. See King 1976, Hudson & Blackburn 1986 and
Arnold 1987 for detailed information on this subject.
Chumashan has two major branches with at least six languages. Earlier
classifications were later refined in Klar 1973, 1977, 1981, and Mithun 1999,Known dialectal divisions are given in parentheses.

Island Chumash [also referred to as Ysleno]: (Cruzeho, Roseho, Migueleho)
Most of the names for the Chumash languages are derived from the
names of the mission communities in which their speakers lived: Obispeno,
fromMissionSanLuisObispo;Purisimeno,fromMissionLaPurisimaConcepcién; Ineseho or Ynesefio, from Mission Santa Ynez; Barbareho, from
Mission Santa Barbara; and Ventureho, from Mission San Buenaventura. The
name of the sixth member of Chumashan, IslandChumash, comes from thefact that its three dialects were spoken by people who lived on the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands: Cruzenho, from Santa Cruz Island; Roseho, from
Santa Rosa Island; and Migueleno, from San Miguel Island.
Much remains to be understood about the dialectal divisions within
each Chumash language. Until all of Harrington’s notes are thoroughly
analyzed, definite conclusions about the dialectal differences within each of the
Chumash languages will have to wait.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"257Chapter 12
éukanu'so that, in order to' Clauses12.0 Introduction
There are 27 adverbial clauses that have the conjunction Gukanu 'so
that, in order to'. This conjunction is derived from a combination of the
conjunctions Gu and kanu. As noted in chapter 11, in adverbial clauses the
conjunction Gu has the meaning 'so that, in order to'. In Chapter 2 we saw
examples of the general conjunction Gu, which translates variously as ‘and,
and so; but; so that, such that'. The morpheme kanu also occurs alone. It isfound in a rare adverbial clause type that has only several tokens, and it is
also found in non-adverbialclauses. Whenkanuoccursalone, it has themeanings 'so that' or 'that is why'. When Gu and kanu co-occur, they are
usually written together as one word in Harrington’s texts. In 16 of the tokens,
the conjunction Gukanu is phonologically attached to the verb that follows it.
In the other 11 tokens, Gukanu appears as a separate phonological word. It
seems clear that, at the time of Harrington’s field work, Gu and kanu weregrammaticizing into a single conjunction, giving rise to the adverbial clause
type described in this chapter.
Like the Gu'so that, in order to' adverbial clause type, all tokens ofthe Gukanu adverbial clause type have a purposive relation to a main clause.
Also, like Gu 'so that, in order to' clauses, Gukanu clauses are all postposed.
Unlike the Gu clause type, however, the Gukanu adverbial clause type
exemplifies a pattern of person marking that is tied to the semantics of
control. As we will see throughout section 12.1, in Gukanu adverbial clauses,when the main clause subject has full control, subject marking in the adverbial
clause is suppressed. Near the end of the chapter, in section 12.2, there is a
brief discussion and illustration of some non-adverbial clauses that have the
Sukanu conjunction. We will look at ways in which patterns of subject
marking in these non-adverbial Gukanu clauses reflect or do not reflect the
patterns of subject marking found in the adverbial] Gukanu clauses. The
chapter ends with a brief summary in 12.3. Before we begin to explore the
subtleties of person marking in this adverbial clause type however, first we will
see an illustration of a prototypical Gukanu clause, its position relative to its
main clause, and the fundamental ways in which it differs with a Gu clause in
two near-minimal pair environments.
258The fundamental characteristics of a prototypical Gukanu clause are
illustrated in (1), which is an excerpt from a text about making a type of oil
lamp called a candil. In the main clause, the third person plural subject,‘they ', lengthens the wick. The purpose of lengthening the wick is so that the
grease of the candilwill not catch on fire, as coded by the Gukanuclausein line b.","[279, 280, 281]"

is no case marking on nouns. Grammatical relations show a nominativeaccusative pattern. There are no canonical adpositions or adjectives. There is
significant prefixing on both verbs and nouns. Suffixation does occur, but not
to the same extent. The basic morphological structure of the verb and noun
is covered in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively.
2.2.1The verb
.
The Barbareho Chumash verb is polymorphemic. The core of the verb
is the verb stem, which is usually a combination of morphemes fused together
over time. (See section 2.2.1.6.) The stem usually has several prefixes and
suffixes. Figure 1 shows the overall configuration of the Barbarenho Chumash
verb. The affixes toward the top of each column are inflectional and occur
furthest out from the stem, while those closer to the bottom are more
derivational and often form part of the stem itself.

41OF SUFFIXES2.2.1.1Person and number
Pronominal affixes show a nominative-accusative pattern. As Ono
(1996) has argued, these affixes are truly referential pronouns. They should
not be thought of as agreement markers, which serve only to copy certain
features of independent NPs. An utterance can be complete with just the verb
and its affixes, because the pronominal affixes already indicate who or what
is being talked about.
The prefixes index the subject of the verb, distinguishing three persons
(first, second, and third person) and four numbers (singular, dual, plural, and
indefinite or unspecified). Table 5 lists the subject pronominal prefixes.

Pronominal suffixes index the object of the verb if the object is first
person, second person, or non-singular third person. The object suffixes do not
distinguish dual and plural. Singular third person objects are not indexed onthe verb.! Table 6 lists the object suffixes.

Emphatic glottalization is often encliticized onto the final syllable, and an
epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.

semantic agents or patients, or appear in transitive or intransitive clauses. This
fact is illustrated below with the third person subject pronoun, s-. In (119),
the subject is a semantic agent, 'a dog', that eats eggs.

is indicated with the prefix sa2-. The past tense is formally marked with the
suffix ~waS. In Barbareho Chumash these tenses are relative (Mithun 1996,
1999). Thus the reference pointto a future time or a past time can be either
the moment of speech or a time under discussion, as in a narrative time line.
Below are some examples of future tense and past tense marking.

307noted elsewhere in this chapter and in chapter 2, the third person pronoun s~
and the stative prefix 2al- never co-occur, even though the first and second

as predicates. For example, in (18) (previously example (1)), the differentsubject kayké clause has the word 'leader' as its predicate. Hence it has the
stative 2a1~ instead of the third person pronoun s~. The subject of the main
clause in line c. is a group of Chumash Indians, the subject of the kayké
clause in line d. is a padre. In this example, the main clause verb is in the
imperative mode, and thus lacks person marking.

<when she was on the verge of death.>'Soledad' is the object NP in the main clause 'They all took care of
Soledad'. The temporal clause tracks this referent by coding it as Given, in
the form of the subject prefix s-. If this temporal clause were preposed,
there could be potential ambiguity as to whether that third person prefix
referred to the topicalized NP 'Soledad' in line a., or the oblique NP
'Florentino' in line b.:
504*'Soledad,she was the mother of Florentino, and ali his older andyounger siblings. When he/she was on the verge of death, they all took
care of Soledad. 'The reversal of order could render a meaning whereby Florentino was on the
verge of death, and so it was up to his siblings to care for their mother, as
Florentino would no longer be able to take care of her. For the above starred
sentence to be completely unambiguous, the full NP 'Soledad' would need
to appear in the preposed temporal clause, where there could be no mistake
that it is coreferent with the third person subject prefix, as in the following
hypothetical example.

hypothetical strategy in (36) over the actual order given in the text. New and
re-activated referents are usually coded as full NPs that are either objects or
intransitive subjects, and the NP hi=Soledad
‘'Soledad' in (36) is an
intransitive subject. However, the strategy in (36) is still less preferable than
the actual order we see in the text, because the third person plural subject,
s~iy-'they',in line d. of the text, immediately follows the explicit mentionof the discourse participants that are co-referent with it: Florentino (line b.)
and all of his older and younger siblings (line c.). Such contiguous,
immediately adjacent reference makes it easier for the listener to process what
it is going on with the discourse participants.
In the previous examples we saw how final temporal clauses can track
newly introduced or re-introduced object NPs. In (37), a final temporal clause
tracks a newly introduced subject NP. The main clause in h. has a subject NP
that is subsequently coded with a subject pronoun in the postposed temporal
clause in line i. The postposed temporal clause has two purposes: it narrows
the meaning of the main clause verb 2ip ‘to say' and it tracks the newly
mentioned referent, 'Luisa'. An initial temporal clause appears in the first
505line of the story. It establishes the scene at the beginning of the narrative,
which as we saw in 22.1.2 is one of the functions of preposed temporal
clauses.","[526, 527, 528]"
"This relative clause is postnominal; it follows its head NP the man. The
relativizer is who; it links the relative clause to its head NP. The head NP hasthe grammatical role of object in its main clause: it is the object of the verb
'caught'. The NPrel, or relative-clause co-referent of the head NP, has thegrammatical role of subject: it is the subject of the verb 'robbed'.
Relative clauses in Barbareho Chumash have the following features.
First, all relative clauses are postnominal. Second, they are linked to the head
noun via the dependent proclitic hi=. Exceptions are rare. Third, all of the
grammatical role positions available in Barbareho can be relativized. Thus
subjects, objects, and obliques--including possessors--can be relativized. Finally,

<so that the lard in the can will not catch on fire.>In line b. above, the verb uqpatin ‘to catch on fire' has prefixed to
it the future tense morpheme, sa?-. All of the 27 Gukanu clauses have this
prefix. As we saw in chapter 11, however, sa?- is found in only 5 or 9% of
the 53 Gu 'so that, in order to' clause tokens. This is one of the significant
morphosyntactic differences between the two clause types.
Another major difference between the Gu 'so that, in order to’ and
éukanu clause types is found in patterns of subject marking on the verb. With
rare exception, Gu clause subjects are always indexed on the verb. Foréukanu clauses, however slightly over half (14 tokens; 52%) have no subject
marking on the verb. The Gu clause in (2) has nearly the same semantic
content as the Gukanu clause in (1) above, but the Gu clause has a subject
pronoun while the Gukanu clause above does not.

the three main morphosyntactic differences between these two clause types:

Finally, tense, aspect and modal morphology was rarely found in those
adverbial clauses that code semantically neutral relations, relations in which
conditionality and temporal meanings are conflated. These 'iffvhen' clauses
most often depicted generic situations that are a part of daily life or which
used to be a part of daily life in the earlier times of the Chumash people.
Such adverbial clauses did not serve to orient the main clause events to a
particular time frame, nor did they point to the internal make-up of the main
clause event. Also, they lacked the kinds of modal morphology and other
structural indicators of irreality commonly found in those clauses that code
conditional relations.
Pronominal subject marking
Different patterns emerged in the marking of pronominal subjects in
the adverbial clauses. In almost all cases where subject marking was affected,
it was affected in the postposed clauses. However, the loss of pronominal
subject marking in the postposed clauses happened for different reasons.
In all purposive clauses coded by the Gukanu 'so that, in order to'
clause type, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. When the main clause subject had full
control over the event or situation depicted in the adverbial clause, subject
marking in the adverbial clause was suppressed. On the other hand, when the
main clause subject did not have control over the event or situation depicted
348in the adverbial clause, or, when it was rather the adverbial clause subject that
had full control, then subject marking in the purpose clause was retained.
Purpose clauses could have the subject pronoun suppressed or retained
Alase af
urha
regardless
of whether
the purpose clause subject was a semantic patient. The
critical difference was the degree of control on the part of the main clause
subject. These generalizations turned out to be true whether the purpose
clause and its main clause had same subjects or different subjects, though
same-subject Gukanu clauses were rare. The semantics of control also seemed
to be the motivating factor behind the loss of the subject pronoun in the one
mehu‘because, since, from; in order to'clause type token that coded apurpose relation. Interestingly, however, there was rarely a loss of pronominal
subject marking in Gu ‘so that, in order to' adverbial clauses, 100% of which
are purposive and postposed. There were clear instances in which the main
clause subject was an agent that had full control of the event depicted in the
adverbial clause, but even so, the presence or absenceof control was notsomething that was coded in the morphosyntax of this adverbial clause type.
With rare exception, Gu'so that, in order to' clauses were found to havesubject marking whether they were same-subject or different-subject clauses.
In all but one of the few, exceptional cases, the lack of subject marking
involved the third person singular prefix s-. The lack of that subject prefix
was argued to be related to articulatory difficulties having to do with the close
proximity of sibilants.
In other adverbial clause types, namely the 2akimpi
when! simultaneous temporal clauses, the kKayké 'because''during, while;
reason clauses,and the kaheé 'like, as if' manner clauses, the loss of the subject pronoun
happened mainly in same-subject adverbial clauses. Such loss seems to be
motivated by the fact that postposed, same-subject adverbial clauses have a
tighter semantic bond with their main clauses than do preposed adverbial
clauses or postposed adverbial clauses with a different subject. In Barbareho
Chumash, however, such loss in subject marking applies only to third person
subjects (singular, plural, or indefinite). It never applies to adverbial clause
subjects in first or second person.
In only several cases was the adverbial clause nominalized. In such
cases, the third person subject pronoun was not retained. This was true
whether the nominalized clause was a same-subject or different-subject
adverbial clause. Such is the expected pattern of nominalized clauses
generally, as we saw in chapter 2.
In several of the adverbial clause types we saw examples of
discontinuous clauses, in which there is intervening material between the
349adverbial conjunction and the rest of its clause. This intervening material may
consist of an adverbial clause from a different clause type, or it may consist
of a left-dislocated noun. Subject marking is affected in these discontinuous
clauses,
WEArginthat
weeadverhial
OSSclauseWEABeretsubject| hPLnronoinekrNLSMeeethatWAEGEemightLAS. tetewnthenyice
wreiiwea¥¥dsoheAasuppressed are not suppressed in discontinuous clauses. This pattern was
especially clear with the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses in chapter 12.
The discontinuous Gukanu clauses retained subject marking but the regular
(non-disrupted) Gukanu clause counterparts did not retain subject marking.
Finally, sometimes in the Kayké'because'and kaheé'like, as if!clause types, subject marking was lost in different-subject clauses. In most cases
where this pattern occurred the adverbial clause predicate had the stative
prefix 2al-. This prefix never co-occurs with the third person pronoun s-,
but it can and does occur with first and second person pronouns. This cooccurrence restriction on the third person pronoun s- and the stative prefix
2?al- remains an unexplained phenomenon in Chumashan linguistics. As
pointed out in chapter 2, it is also not always clear why a given predicate
would take the stative prefix instead of the third person pronoun on one
occasion, and then (on another occasion) take the third person pronoun
instead of the stative prefix. Transitivity of the predicate is not in all cases a
factor, since the stative prefix 2al- can and does appear in finite verbs with
transitivizing morphology, such as applicative suffixes. Further research into
the area of third person reference in Barbareno Chumash discourse should
shed light on the patterns of subject marking we have seen in the adverbial
clause constructions.
Ways in which point of view ts coded
Four adverbial clause conjunctions were found to have a significant role
in coding the narrator’s or speaker’s stance, point of view, or expectations
about when and whether a given event had occurred, could occur, or wouldoccur. Generally, when the haku ‘if' conjunction is used, the event or
situation named in the adverbial clause is believed to be very unlikely but not
altogether impossible. When the na 'if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is believed to be possible indeed, but it is not necessarily expected
to occur. When the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the connotation is that
the event or situation is not only likely to occur, but it may also be expected
to occur. The conjunction wa ‘if; when' seems to be used when the speaker
does not wish to frame a given event or situation from his or her own
perspective, expectations, or experience. One reason for the speaker’s
reluctance could be that he or she does not have enough first-hand evidence
350or personal experience to make claims concerning the matter under discussion.
The conjunction wa also appears to be used when the speaker wishes to
refrain from making any assumptions about what another person or entity can
¥
+
dc or will do,
do. In
other
words, the speaker is not asserting his or her own
personal stance when he or she uses a wa adverbial clause.
The usage of the wa ‘if; when' conjunction is similar to the usage of
the na ‘if; when' conjunction in certain respects. The na conjunction can be
used to express a neutral stance, or a neutral expectation, about what anotherperson or entity will do or is able to do. However, whereas the na conjunction
implies that the speaker is speaking from his or her own perspective (however
neutral), the use of the wa conjunction seems to imply that, whatever the
speaker is saying, it is not something he or she is framing from his or her own
perspective.
At least three of the four adverbial clause conjunctions mentioned
above (wa‘if; when', na‘if; when'and haku'if') can be combined withother adverbial clause conjunctions to convey even more subtle distinctions in
the speaker’s stance or perspective. We saw, for example, that the conjunction
wa can be combined with the adverbial clause conjunction 2akay hu ‘until’.
The result is still an adverbial clause that codes a terminal temporal boundary,
but the conjunction wa adds an additional layer of meaning. It says that the
speaker’s own perspective is not adequate for determining when the terminal,
temporal event has happened, or whether it even can happen; rather, the
perspective necessary is that of someone else, specifically that of the referent
that is coded as the subject of the adverbial clause. Also, the concessive
conjunction 2iyeme ‘though; even if' may combine with either haku 'if'
or na‘if; when’to form different kinds of concessive conditional relations.","[370, 371, 372, 373]"
"Table 13. Distribution of na ‘if; when; (in order) to' clauses by position and
semantic relation216Notes to Chapter 81. I thank Paul Barthmaier for suggesting this semantic interpretation.
2. In Harrington’s transcription, the word hinapalta°:2min, (with the
following comma) immediately precedes its translation, 'if you know how'.
Both the word and its translation are right at the end of the page in
Harrington’s notes. It is probable that the comma was put there to separate
the Barbareho word from its translation rather than signify an intonation
boundary. The next word hipiskila° 1wun follows on the next page, along
with its translation 'how to shear them’.","[238, 239]"
"In general, however, non-adverbial Gukanu clauses are less sensitive
to the semantics of control, while adverbial Gukanu clauses are more sensitiveto it . It makes sense that this should be so. The adverbial Gukanu clause is
more syntactically dependent upon the main clause that precedes it. It is
therefore more structurally and semantically affected by that preceding clause
than is the case for a non-adverbial Gukanu clause.

circumstance always results in the otherwise absent subject pronoun appearing
prefixed on the verb, just as it would be if the verb were not nominalized. If
the nominalized, main clause verbs in lines a., c. and f. were fully inflected toinclude person marking, each would lose the article 1= and the glottal stop

purpose clauses differently depending upon whether the subject of the
purpose clause is the same as or different than the subject of the main clause.
For example, in English and many other languages, same-subject purpose
clauses often have an infinitive or otherwise reduced form of the verb. Thus
in the sentence 'we went to the zoo to see the animais', the purpose clause
‘to see the animals' has an infinitive verb 'to see'. Barbareho éu clauses
do not have such distinct syntax, however. A Gu clause with the same subject
as the main clause does not have any special morphology or reduced marking
related to the fact that it is a same-subject clause, nor is there necessarily any
particular morphology or form of the verb when the main clause and éu
clause have different subjects.
For example, as we saw in (1) above, the subject of the main clause
verb 'stay a while' is not the subject of the Gu clause verb 'cure someone'.
Both subjects are in third person singular, however, and both subjects are
indexed on the respective verbs with the third person prefix s-. There is no
morphology on either verb that indicates a different subject. In (2), the main
clause subject and the Gu adverbial clause subject are the same. The subject,
241a sorcerer named Saximumasét, is indexed with the third person prefix s-,
both on the main clause verb as well as on the Gu clause verb. The main
clause appears in line c., and the Gu clause is in line d. The Gu clause verb
has no special tense, aspect, or moda! morphology, nor any reduction in
morphosyntax, that results from it being a same-subject clause.

presumably struggle for control. The swordfishes relentlessly pursue the whales
with the intent of making the whales beach themselves. The traditional belief
is that the swordfish did this in order to provide food for the Chumash people.
Both the main clause subject, 'swordfishes', and the adverbial clause subject,'whales', are referenced with the third person plural s-iy- in the main
clause and adverbial clause respectively. In addition, the referent for 'whales'
is indexed with the plural object suffix -wun on the main clause verb
telelenus 'to chase after'.

These nominalized clauses are from different texts that discuss methods
of locking up homes and other structures long ago. In (270) the nominalized
verb has the object argument hi=l=ku
‘a person, some person'. The
nominalized verb in (271), which differs only by having a past tense suffix,
does not have any NP arguments. Both nominalized clauses mean basically the
79|same thing: 'one who was unknown! or 'one who they (indef.) did not
know '. In head-marking languages, especially, NPs that are clausal arguments
further delineate or elaborate upon the information encoded in the head verb.
Thus NPs within nominalized clauses are dependent elements on the verb and
not vice versa.®

appears mainly in constructions involving focussed or contrasted NPs,
appositions, questions, and relative clauses. Almost always, the subject of the

inehu ‘because, since, from; in order to' Clauses15.0 IntroductionIn the corpus there are only 10 adverbial clauses that have the
conjunction mehu 'because, since, from; in order to'. It is possibly a
grammaticized combination of the emphatic particle ne and the remote deictic
morpheme hu. In Harrington’s texts this conjunction is always written as a
proclitic, attached to the verb. In the one example from the Beeler and
Whistler text, it is written as two separate particles, ie. me hu.
Like the Kayké 'because' adverbial clauses discussed in chapter 14,
almost all mehu clauses code a reason relation with a main clause. However,though all Kayké clauses occur postposed, 3 of the mehu clauses were found
to be preposed. There are also interesting and subtle differences between
reason clauses coded with a kayké conjunction and reason clauses coded with
a tehu conjunction. The differences have to do with: i) the kinds of causal
relations these adverbial clauses tend to code; ii) the frequency of samesubject vs. different-subject clauses; iii) pronominal subject marking; and iv)
frequency of human subjects. These topics are dealt with in the subsections of
15.1. One mehu clause was found to code a purposive relation. This token is
discussed in 15.2. In addition to the difference in the kind of semantic relation
it codes relative to the rest of the mehu clauses, it has structural features thatset it apart from the rest. There is one token of a discontinuous mehu
adverbial clause. This is presented in 15.3. Finally, a chapter summary is given
in 15.4.
Before we get into these issues, however, we will first see an illustration
of a typical inehu adverbial clause, in both initial and final position.
A preposed mehu clause is given in (1), in line b. The mehu clause
""Because they were law-abiding' exists in a reason relation with the set of
clauses in lines c. - e.

An example of the situation in (G) is illustrated in (6). In this example
there are two Gu 'so that, in order to' clauses. The first one is in line d. and

In fact, all same243subject Gu clauses retain person marking in the clause, whether transitive or
intransitive.
In different-subject Gu adverbial clause constructions, sometimes the
main clause subject has more choice and control over the actions or state of
affairs of the adverbial clause subject, and other times it does not. This
distinction is not coded in the morphosyntax of Gu clauses. As we will see in
chapter 12, however, the semantics of control plays an important role in the
presence or absence of the adverbial clause subject pronoun in Gukanu 'so
that, in order to' clauses. As a result, there are significant morphosyntactic
differences between Gu clauses and Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses. Sothat there can be an adequate comparison between these two adverbial clause
types, examples of Gu clause constructions are given below that illustrate
different degrees of control on the part of the main clause subject. We will
start with one end of the spectrum, where the main clause subject has total
control over the adverbial clause subject.
In (7), the main clause subject is a human whose spirit helper
(2atiswin) has endowed him with certain powers. He has full control over
the Gu clause subject. The subject of the Gu adverbial clause is an inanimate
substance--cannon powder. By magically manipulating the cannon powder, the
main clause subject is able to disable the cannons.","[265, 266]"
"12.1.2 Different-subject clauses
In addition to the three same-subject Gukanu clauses just discussed,
the text in example (7) has two different-subject Gukanu clauses. These
appear in lines d. and h. As with same-subject Gukanu clauses, the presence
or absence of the subject pronoun in different-subject Gukanu clauses reflects
265the main clause subject’s control over what happens in the adverbial clause
event. First we will look at the clause in d. and its main clause in line c.,
reproduced below as example (8).

<in order that they (unspecified) will not be able to see them.>In the Gukanu clause in d. above, the main verb in the clause, alaqway 'to
be able', lacks the third person subject pronoun s-. If this verb were marked
for person, it would appear as *¢ukanu=s—-am-e-sa?-alaqway. The lack
of the subject pronoun in this verb reflects the fact that the main clause
subject has total control over whether or not the adverbial clause subject will
be able to see the main clause subject. The main clause subject has control by
virtue of wearing the skunk claw talisman, which allows the main clause
subject to be invisible at will. The adverbial clause subject is indexed with the
pronouns~on the complementverbin d., kutiy'to see', but thatpronoun is there because of the particular requirements of the grammar of
complementation in Barbareho; its presence has nothing to do with the main
clause subject in line c.
The second different-subject Gukanu clause in (7) also retained its
subject pronoun. This clause is reproduced again in (9) below.","[287, 288]"
"The chain makes that both wheels are the same size.’The 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause above is ambiguous as to its
status as an adverbial clause, since Harrington’s punctuation and translation
render it a complete sentence on its own. It can be interpreted as an
afterthought adverbial clause, since crosslinguistically such clauses tend to
occur in an intonation unit separate from the preceding main clause (Chafe
1984; Givén 1990); or, it can be interpreted as an independent clause, with the
meaning ‘at that time they had not yet invented the chain'.
There is no preferential order for this adverbial clause type. Half of the
tokens are preposed, the other half are postposed. One difference between
preposed and postposed ?akimpi ‘during, while' clauses is found in samevs. different-subject marking. All preposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clauses
have a subject that is different than that of the main clause, e.g. (4) and (6)
above, but three out of the four postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clauses
have a subject that is the same as that of the main clause, e.g. (5) above. The
one postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause that has a different subject
is the one in (7) above, which as noted is ambiguous in its status as an
adverbial clause.
There also seems to be some difference with regard to pronominal
marking in the adverbial clause verb, though without more tokens one cannot
make a strong claim. For the preposed tokens, there tends to be full
pronominal subject marking in both the adverbial clause and its corresponding
main clause. The only exception is in (8) below, where the stative prefix 2aloccurs instead of the third person pronoun s- on a predicate noun. This
145would be expected since one of the ways for nouns to become verbalized is
through a stative morpheme such as 2al-~, and the third person subject
pronoun s- is never found to be prefixed to this morpheme. (See chapter 2
regarding the mutually-exclusive distribution of the stative prefix ?al-— and thethird pronominal prefix s- in verbs.)

clitic hi= and the distal deictic clitic ho?=, this siy- is probably the third

themes, rather than the third person plural subject siy- that is prefixed to
verbal themes.
Two of the final 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause tokens do not have
subject marking because the adverbial clause subject is third person singular,
and the verb has the stative prefix 2al-. As noted previously, the third person
subject pronoun is never found prefixed to that stative morpheme. The first
example of this, for a postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause, was seen
in (5) with the verb 2al-wulaéu 'STV-be.drunk'. In the postposed
?akimpi clause in (10) there is no third person subject pronoun s— on the
verb 2aleken 'to be alive' in line e. This verb is a lexicalization of the
stative prefix 2al- and the verb leken'to stay; be seated; live'. The mainclause itself (second part of line d.) happens to be a nominalized clause, thus
it does not have subject marking either.

12.1.1.2 Same-subject clauses in which the subject pronoun is suppressedExamples (5) and (6) above are the only tokens of same-subject
éukanu clauses that have subject pronouns. In both cases, the main clause
subjects have little or no control over what they undergo in the adverbial
clause event. In same-subject clauses where the main clause subject does have
total control, the adverbial clause does not have a subject pronoun. It may,
however, still index the plurality of the subject with the prefix iy-, or it may
index the indefiniteness of the subject with the prefix am-, where applicable.

"364Chapter 18Differences in Morphosyntactic Structure18.0 Introduction
Crosslinguistically, we find that preposed and postposed adverbial
clauses may differ in morphosyntactic structure (Givén 1990). The differences
always point to the general tendency for postposed clauses, more so than
preposed clauses, to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses. For
the Barbareno Chumash language, differences in morphosyntactic patterning
are best examined in terms of two categories of adverbial clause types: (i)
those clause types that have both preposed and postposed tokens; and, (ii)
those clause types that have only postposed tokens, or an overwhelming
tendency toward postposed tokens. For the relevant clause types in group (ii),
the relationship between morphosyntactic patterning and bondedness with the
main clause was dealt with in part II of the dissertation. A brief recapitulation
of the findings will be given in 18.1. The clause types in group (i) will be the
focus of 18.2. A summary follows in 18.3
18.1 Clause types that are mostly postposedIn some of the clause types that are postposed there was a reduction
in pronominal subject marking. For the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clause
type in chapter 12 and the one purposive ehu 'in order to' clause token in
chapter 15, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. The greater the control on the part of the
main clause subject (which was always an agent), the greater chance there was
that the adverbial clause would not have a subject pronoun. We saw that the
adverbial clause subject pronoun was retained, however, when the main clause
subject did not have full control over the situation coded by the adverbial
clause. The loss of subject marking in the adverbial clause could happen
whether the adverbial clause and main clause had same subjects or different
subjects. In other clause types that tend to be postposed, especially the kayké
""because ' reason clauses and the kaheé ' like, as if' manner clauses, we sawthat reduction in pronominal subject marking was found mainly in samesubject adverbial clauses. This pattern reflects the fact that final, same-subject
adverbial clauses tend to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses
than postposed, different-subject adverbial clauses.
365As noted above, postposed kaheé 'like, as if' clauses with the samesubject as the main clause were found to have a reduction in subject marking.
A couple of the postposed tokens in this clause type are also distinguished by
the fact that they have the dependent proclitic hi=, This is the
morphosyntactic feature that is commonly found in postposed tokens of those
adverbial clause types that are not limited to final position. A discussion and
illustration of the pattern that involves this important, distinguishing feature
is given next in 18.2.
18.2 Clause types that have preposed and postposed tokensFor most of the adverbial clause types that have both initial and final
tokens, the only morphosyntactic feature that distinguishes the two positions
is the presence or absence of the proclitic hi=. As we saw in chapter two, this
clitic codes a syntactically dependent relation between one element and
another. In adverbial clauses, it codes dependency on a main clause.
Specifically, it attaches to the postposed clause, but not to the preposed clause
of a given adverbial clause type. Exceptions are rare. Illustrations of this
important difference can be seen throughout part I of the dissertation in the
following adverbial clause types: 2akimpi ‘during; while', mali 'when',
haku ‘if', na ‘if; when', wa ‘if; when' and kaheé Hike, as if'. The
pattern is clearly seen in the comparisons given below in examples (1) through
(10). We will start with a pair of initial and final mali clauses that are
contrasted in (1) and (2).","[386, 387, 388]"

cases, the position of the neutral clause has more to do with the demands of
referent tracking than with anything else. In all cases the neutral clause
introduces a referent, a core argument, that is coded with a full NP. This
referent is subsequently the subject or object argument in the clauses that
follow. For example, in the textlet in (20), the neutral clause in line b.
introduces the subject NP 'the swordfish', which is also the subject of the
main clause in line c.

"Dependent marking with hi= almost never occurs on adverbial clause
types that are always or almost always postposed. For example, it is never
found procliticized to the following adverbial clause conjunctions: 2akay hu
‘until’, 2iyeme ‘though; even if', Gu ‘so that, in order to', Gukanu 'so

kaheé clause tokens are postposed, two of the postposed tokens have
dependent marking with hi=. These are given below in (13) and (14).",[393]
"Their main function is that of qualifying the meaning of the main clause
proposition. These two factors alone, i.e. i) that the adverbial clause does not
have a global role in structuring the discourse and ii) that the adverbial clause
serves mainly in the localized role of qualifying the meaning of the main
clause, are often enough motivation for the adverbial clause to assume a
postposed position. In this sense, the postposed position is the default position
for adverbial clauses. (Since topics and themes come first rather than last, in
the order of topic-comment and theme-rheme, the adverbial clause that is not
serving in a topic-like or theme-like capacity, ie. as a point of orientation,
would most likely be postposed.) There are, however, other factors that
increase the probability of an adverbial clause appearing postposed instead of
preposed: i) referent tracking; ii) an embedded main clause; iii) a main clause
that already has preposed material, such as a topicalized NP or a preposed
adverbial clause; iv) the adverbial clause has the additional function of an
afterthought or reminder; v) the adverbial clause is part of a routinized
construction in which the adverbial clause is always in final position; and
finally, specific to temporal clauses, vi) the adverbial clause codes a terminal
temporal boundary.
For some of these factors, to understand why they increase the
likelihood that an adverbial clause will be postposed it is helpful to look to the
theory of information flow (Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994), the principle of
least effort (Zipf 1935) and iconic motivation in language (Haiman 1983), all
of which are interrelated. Considering first the factor of referent tracking, we
saw that an adverbial clause tends to be final if it is tracking a referent that
was introduced (or re-introduced) into the discourse context as a full NP in
the associated main clause. The full NP has New information status in the
main clause, as it is being activated or re-activated in the listener’s
consciousness. In the postposed adverbial clause, the NP acquires Given
status, as it is then already activated in the listener’s consciousness, and thereferent is indexed as a pronominal affix instead of as a full NP. A reversal of
the clausal order would in many cases lead to ambiguity in meaning, as it
would not in all cases be clear who or what was being referred to, by the
pronominal affix, if the adverbial clause were preposed.
Other factors underscore the importance of conceptual relevance and
(hence) iconic motivation in the ordering of clauses. A clause is more likely553to be contiguous to the clause whose meaning it qualifies or completes. Thus
in all cases where the main clause was embedded, the adverbial clause wasnever preposed. If the main clause in question was a complement clause, the
adverbial ciause did not come between it and its matrix verb. If the main
clause in question was a relative clause, the adverbial clause did not come
between it and its head NP in the matrix clause. In the former case, it wouldbe infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the matrix verb
and complement clause, because the complement clause completes the
meaning imparted by the matrix verb, while the adverbial clause adds further
information about the complement clause. In the latter case, it would be
infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the head NP and
relative clause, because the relative clause provides information that is directly
relevant to the head NP, while the adverbial clause provides information that
is directly relevant to the relative clause. The clausal orders are iconically
motivated in that the clauses most conceptually relevant to each other are
always positioned next to each other. Such iconically motivated clausal orders
should require the least cognitive effort in processing information about the
events and states named by the clauses in question.
Iconic motivation also has a crucial role in the factor specific to
temporal clauses: in the corpus, temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries tend to be postposed rather than preposed. The motivation is
iconic in that terminal-boundary temporal clauses code events that happen last
in a given series of events. Hence, the clauses that code them tend to be last
in a given series of clauses. The only exceptions are those that also perform
as pivotal points of orientation, making reference to a prior event and also
providing a context in which a succeeding event occurs. In such cases there is
a competing motivation: terminal events are last in a given series of events
and hence should be coded by final clauses, but pivotal points of orientation
need to be coded first in a given a series of clauses, because they provide
crucial, contextualizing information for the following event(s) or situation(s).
In such cases, the latter motivation takes precedence. So the terminalboundary temporal clause, which would otherwise be postposed, has to be
preposed in those cases.
Adverbial clauses also tend to be final when the associated main clause
already has preposed, associated material, such as a topicalized NP or another
adverbial clause. This preposed, associated material is already doing the task
of setting a scene or otherwise breaking the discourse into thematicallycoherent chunks. It is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) for the
adverbial clause in question to assume that role, so it assumes the postposed
354position. Another possible reason that the adverbial clause is final, in such
cases, is that it might too much of a cognitive burden to have so much
pragmatically-marked material preposed to the main clause, especially in a
initio! language Uke Darhasohn Chumas
Finally, adverbial clauses that serve as reminders or afterthoughts are
always final. The order is again iconically motivated in that reminders and
afterthoughts are comments on events and situations that were mentioned in
the preceding context, and the clausal order reflects this by the fact that
reminders and afterthoughts are coded by final clauses.
Relative propensity toward having a global roleThe adverbial clauses in part IV differ in the degree to which they
perform global, discourse-organizing tasks. The percentage of preposed tokens
reflects their relative propensities toward having a global role. Purpose
clauses, with 9% being preposed, were the least likely to do anything other
than qualify the main clause. Conditional clauses, with 86% being preposed,
were the most likely to perform discourse-structuring tasks. Neutral clauses
were second, followed by temporal clauses. The distribution of the clausal
tokens by position is summarized in Table 63.","[575, 576, 577]"

kayké‘because’ Clauses14.0 Introduction
In the corpus there are 41 adverbial clauses that have the conjunction
kayké 'because, for’. The analogous conjunction for Ineseho Chumash is
ka&a 'because'. The Barbareho conjunction appears to have arisen from
two demonstratives: *k(2)ay and *ke?. It is not known at this point
whether these demonstratives can be reconstructed back to Proto-Chumash.
Harrington found reflexes of both demonstratives in Ineseho: kay‘he, she,it' and ke? 'this; thus, so, in this way' (Applegate 1972a,b). *k( 2) ay does
not have a modern reflex in Barbareho. However, it probably has a historical
connection with the Barbareno proclitic ka=, a reflex of the Proto-Chumash
demonstrative *ka2. The proclitic ka= has several, disparate meanings and
functions:'staTrvE','CONSTRASTIVE FOCUS"",'RELATIVIZER', 'COMPLEMENTIZER"",and 'then, so'. The demonstrative *ke2? appears to have a Barbareno reflex
in the interrogative particle ké 'what; whose; why'. Other Barbareho words
that involve a lexicalization of one or both of the old demonstratives *k( 2) ay
and *ke? include Kaykiké 'what', kenG 'why' and nukaké ‘where’.
In addition to having the conjunction kayké, adverbial clauses of this
type share three characteristics. First, all of the tokens are postposed. Second,
all kayké clauses code a reason (also referred to as 'causal') relation. Third,
the kind of reason relations that tend to be coded by this clause type are
reminiscent of action-based and knowledge-based causal relations (Schiffrin
1987:202), fourth-order and third-order reason relations (Hengeveld 1998) or
causal/reason relations based on internal motivations (Givon 1990:834-835, cf.
also Halliday and Hasan 1976). kKayké clauses that have action-based or
fourth-order readings code reasons for speech acts such as commands,
requests, and claims. These speech acts may be either those of Mary Yee
herself or that of someone Yee is quoting. Kayké clauses that have
knowledge-based or third-order readings code reason relations in which the
modified material (Event 'X') is a conclusion that the speaker has reached
based upon the material coded by the reason clause (Event 'Y'). Finally,
kayké clauses may sometimes code what are referred to as fact-based
(Schiffrin 1987:202), second-order (Hengeveld 1998:345-346) or externallymotivated (Givén 1990:834) causal relations. In fact-based readings, Event
294'X' is the direct result of Event 'Y'; Event 'Y' causes Event 'X'. The
line between fact-based and knowledge-based readings is not always clear,
however.

clause is used, the causal relation appears to be treated as self-evident by the
narrator. Another important difference between the reason relations coded by
kayké- and mehu reason clauses is that the latter always code results that are
not willfully intended. Many kayké clauses, on the other hand, code reasonrelations that involve some willful intention. Differences between the kayké
and mehu clause types are further explored in chapter 15.
Illustrations of reason relations coded by kayké clauses are given in
14.1. Following that is a detailed discussion on pronominal subject marking in
14.2 and its subsections. Discontinuous kayké clauses are treated in 14.3.
Highlights of salient patterns are summarized in 14.4.
14.1 Examples of reason relations coded by kayké clauses
Reasons for speech acts are always coded by kayké clauses. Thus a
reason given for a command, request, or claim is coded by a kayké clause.
Examples are seen in (1) - (3). Each example involves quoted speech. In (1),
a Chumash leader, who is one of the protagonists in the story, uses a kayké
clause (line d) to express his reason for giving the command in line c.

"1.3 Sources of primary data
The data in this study come primarily from John P. Harrington’s
manuscript materials of linguistic and ethnographic work among the Chumash
people. These are catalogued in Mills and Brickfield 1986. Harrington’s notes
and recordings are the largest primary source of data for all of the Chumash
languages. From his work on the Barbarenho language alone he produced tens
of thousands of pages of field notes. From 1913 until a few years before his
death in 1961, Harrington worked with some of the last known speakers of
Barbareno. The best known of these were Luisa Ignacio, Juliana Ignacio, Juande Jesus Justo, Lucrecia Garcia, and Mary Yee. All of these people were
bilingual in Barbareho and Spanish; Mary Yee was also fluent in English. In
addition, Lucrecia Garcia and Mary Yee were able to read and write in
Barbareho. The data used in my study are mostly from the texts and
grammatical notes recorded by Harrington on paper from Mary Yee. Data
from other speakers will be cited when necessary.
During the time of his fieldwork, Harrington recorded languages on
paper, wax cylinders and aluminum discs. Convenient tools such as magnetic
tape recorders were not available until late in his career. He used a detailed
but idiosyncratic phonetic transcription when writing down a language, andoften did not write phonemically.? The consensus among linguists who knowHarrington’s work is that he had an extraordinarily acute ear for phoneticdetail (Callaghan1975,1976). ThusHarrington’s written recordingsofAmerican Indian languages are valued by present-day linguists for their
accuracy and reliability.
A second corpus of primary discourse data comes from Madison
Beeler, who worked with Mary Yee during a series of field trips from about
1954 through the early 1960s. To my knowledge, this corpus contains several
dozen notebooks and nine tape recordings.
William Bright worked with Mary Yee for a brief period in 1952. His
notes consist of wordlists and short paradigms.
There are other primary sources of data on Chumash languages. These
sources are primarily wordlists recorded in the 1700s and 1800s. The more
well-known of these were recorded by Arroyo de la Cuesta in 1833-36, Pinart
in 1878 (published in Heizer 1952), and Henshaw in 1884 (published in Heizer
1955).
1.4 Previous analyses of Barbareno Chumash*
A truly thorough description of the Barbareho Chumash language has
yet to appear, but one may find a clear and concise orientation to Barbareno4discourse and grammar in Ono’s 1996 dissertation. Sketches and analyses of
the Barbareno language are also found in Beeler 1970a and 1976, and in the
extensive, detailed footnotes given in Beeler and Whistler 1980. Detailed
discussions on dependent marking, relative clauses and related structures are
given in Wash 1999a and 1999b. There are also discussions and illustrative
examples touching upon many aspects of Barbareho grammar in Harrington’s
notes, especially in Reel 3, Volume 3, of the Kraus Microfilm Reel Edition(Mills and Brickfield 1986). In addition to these sources there are two articles
on the placement and functions of glottalization (Mithun et al. 1994, Ono et
al. 1994). Two studies have been published on sibilant harmony in Barbareho
(Beeler 1970b, Mithun 1997). Finally, there is a phonological study on
reduplication, which is a prominent phonological and grammatical process in
all Chumash languages (Wash 1995).
No comprehensive dictionary of the Barbareno language has yet been
published. However, Beeler (1979) published a list of approximately 1,000
words, Whistler (1980) followed up on this work with a working dictionary
containing about 2,000 words. There is also a helpful glossary of terms from
several different Chumash languages. in volume five of the Hudson and
Blackburn (1986) series.
1.5 Theoretical orientation
This dissertation is based on a functionally-oriented approach to
linguistics. A functionally-oriented approach seeks to understand language in
all of its cognitive, communicative, socio-cultural and diachronic aspects. It is
the complex way in which these aspects of language interact that accounts for
the patterns observed in human languages, both individually and on a crosslinguistic basis. The complex interaction of these aspects of language is best
seen in the ways language is actually used. Hence, when linguists who follow
this approach seek to describe and explain why certain forms or structures
pattern as they do in a given language, they want to work with as much
context of the language as possible. They seek to have a database that is built
upon connected discourse rather than only single forms and structures elicited
out of context, the latter being the standard for some schools of linguistics.
Thus if the language under investigation has a community of speakers, a
functionally-oriented linguist will seek to record as many genres of naturally
occurring discourse as possible, including conversation and the telling of
stories. Such recordings are audiotaped and/or videotaped, and are
subsequently transcribed in a systematic way (e.g. Du Bois et al. 1993). From
such data, both qualitative analyses (e.g. Chafe 1980) and quantitative analyses
5(e.g. Givén 1983, Du Bois 1987, Fox and Thompson 1990 and Ford 1993
among many others) are possible.
One broad area of functional approaches to linguistics that is used in
this dissertation is the theory of INFORMATION FLOW (Chafe1976, 1987,1992,1994). According to this theory, the changing cognitive state of information in
the minds of the speaker and hearer motivate particular linguistic forms and
structures. For example, newly mentioned referents are commonly coded as
full NPs, because in this form the hearer is able to identify who the speaker
is talking about. Subsequent mentions of the same referent usually take
pronominal form, e.g. English 'he', 'she', 'it'. These forms of the referent
reflect its Given cognitive status. This theory is particularly helpful in part four
of this dissertation as we examine the relationship between mentions of
referents and clausal ordering in adverbial clause constructions.
The theory of information flow is connected to some extent to the
principle of least effort in the production and processing of language (Zipf
1935). This principle, along with the functionally-oriented notion of iconic and
economic motivation in language (Haiman 1983) will be shown to be relevant
in understanding the various patterns one finds with initial and final adverbial
clauses in Barbareno discourse, in parts three and four of the dissertation.
1.6 Literature review
Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. Thistopic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals withconstructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he
6gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"Also,mehuclauseconstructions always depict unintentional acts or results. The differences in the
reason relations coded by these two clause types reflect distinctions betweeninternal and external motivations (Halliday and Hasan 1976, Givén 1990:834835), distinctions among action-based, knowledged-based and fact-based causal
relations (Schiffrin 1987), and distinctions among fourth-, third- and secondorder types of causal relations in the Entity Type Hierarchy (Hengeveld 1998),
in that mehuclausescodeexternal,fact-based,andsecond-ordercausalrelations.
There is an array of adverbial clause types that one can identify based
upon specific adverbial conjunctions. Thirteen such clause types are analyzed,
discussed and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16. These comprise almost all
of the adverbial clause types that have conjunctions in this language. There
may be other kinds of Barbareho adverbial clause types that have
117conjunctions, but some possible adverbial clause types were not included
because they could not be clearly identified as adverbial clauses. Also, a
possible adverbial clause type was omitted if there were not enough data orcontext that would allow a substantive-enough discussionand illustration for
that particular adverbial clause type. Still, the adverbial clause types discussed
and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16 range from the very rare ku ‘lest, so
that...not' adverbial clause type, which only has two tokens, to the numerous
na ‘if; when; in order to' adverbial clause type, which has nearly 200 tokens.
Part II has the following chapters, named for the adverbial conjunction
that identifies the adverbial clause type in question:

the adverbial conjunction, including its history and any cognates it is known to
have. Next is an overall view of the number of tokens the adverbial clause
type has, what kinds of semantic relations it codes, and what positions
(preposed or postposed) it may take. The body of each chapter then illustrates
each relevant semantic relation and the ways in which it is coded in that clause
type. Special attention is given to those issues and patterns that stand out, e.g.
unusual or prominent patterns in person marking, tense/aspect/modality, ways
in which the speaker’s point of view is coded, etc.
The focus of part II of the dissertation is upon 13 adverbial clause
types that have adverbial conjunctions. A much smaller subset of Barbareho
adverbial clauses lack adverbial conjunctions. They are discussed in chapter
3, to which we now turn.","[139, 140]"

Object-relative. Structurally they are very different, however. Example (322)
illustrates the only relative-clause token in the analyzed corpus that has a
relativizer in the form of ka=. Like the contrastive focus marker and stative
proclitic of the same form, the relativizer ka= is a reflex of the protoChumash demonstrative *ka. The relative clause construction has a similar
form to the cleft construction illustrated earlier in (284), with the important
exception that the relative clause is not nominalized.

nauseated, there probably would not be any problem in understanding
immediately who the subject of the adverbial clause is in d. if the clause were
preposed instead of postposed, as in
‘Boil manzanilla, then if/when she gets nauseated, you administer it to
the mother-to-be'.
However, the attested order in the text is still preferable, because the mainclause continues tracking the newly introduced referent 'manzanilla'. Thus
the proposition 'Boil manzanilla' is more relevant to the proposition 'you
administer it to the mother-to-be' than it is to the proposition 'ifAwhen she
gets nauseated'. The adverbial clause, meanwhile, only gives further
information about administering the manzanilla tea. It also continues tracking
the referent tthe mother-to-be' which was reintroduced in the associated
main clause. The attested order in the text is thus iconically motivated in the
sense that the elements most closely relevant to each other are also
immediately adjacent to one another.
23.2.2 Qualifying embedded main clausesOnly three of all the neutral clause tokens in the corpus have main
clauses that are embedded, and these are all postposed. As shown in Ford and
Thompson (1986) for conditional clauses in English, and in chapters 21 and
22 for Barbareno conditional and temporal clauses, adverbial clauses that
have embedded main clauses tend:tobe postposed. The motivation for this
clausal order again is iconic, in that the two elements most closely relevant to
each other are also immediately contiguous. The associated main clause
follows its matrix verb, if it is a complement clause, or it follows its head noun,if it is a relative clause, because it adds crucial information about the meaning544of its head element. The adverbial neutral clause does not intervene between
its main clause and the head element of that clause, because the adverbialclause serves only to qualify the meaning of its associated clause; it has
nothing directly to do with the head clement which its main clause modifies.
Two examples illustrate this pattern for neutral clauses. In (28), the
main clause is a relative clause, 'with which they bathed their eyes' (line c.),
which modifies the head noun ‘a medicinal tea' (line b.). The neutral
adverbial clause in line d. then modifies the information in its preceding main
clause.","[565, 566, 567]"
"131.9MethodologyFirst, for the purpose of consistency I have assumed that all of the data
from Harrington and Beeler were recorded correctly, and that any aberration
reflects something other than error. Thus my analysis does not assume ' error
in recording’ as an (ad hoc) explanation for why certain data might not fit a
general pattern. Further issues concerning either Harrington’s or Beeler’s
notes are addressed as needed.
1.9.1 Sorting adverbial clauses by structural typeIn the first part of this study I analyzed each of the narrative texts for
adverbial clauses that have one of the following adverbial conjunctions:
2akay hu
2akimpi‘until!
‘during; while'mali‘when!haku‘if?na
wa‘if; when; in order to'
‘if; when!?iyeme‘though, even if!éu

'so that, in order to'ku
kayké‘lest, so that...not!
""because; for'tihehu""because, since, from; in order to'kanheé""like, as if!","[35, 36]"
"In lines d. and h. there are two other instances of a colon. Like the two na
‘ifAwhen' adverbial clauses that are punctuated with a colon, these two
clauses have a verb of saying that is followed by quoted speech. These usages
of the colon are congruent with the way in which Harrington used the colon
throughout the corpus of Barbareho narratives: the colon is only used in
clauses that precede quoted speech or a list of things. Given this consistent
use of the colon in Harrington’s transcription, and given that there tends to
be a prosodic boundary between a clause with a verb of saying and the clause
of quoted speech that follows, in spoken speech (Givén 1990), Harrington’s
use of the colon no doubt represents a pause in Yee’s speech.
Looking again at Table 43, for the two most numerous adverbial clause
types, na 'if; when; in order to' and mali ‘when’, there appears to be only
a slight preference for punctuation in the initial clauses. A little over half of
the initial clauses for both of these types are followed by punctuation. Among
the initial na ‘if; when; in order to' clauses, 53% are followed by a comma
(or more rarely a colon as we saw above). Among the initial mali 'when'
clauses, 58% are followed by a comma. On the surface there appears to be
no motivation for punctuation--Harrington seemed just as likely as not to write
a comma at the end of an initial clause. However, on closer inspection there
turns out to be a relation between the length of the adverbial clause and
whether or not it has punctuation. This is illustrated in Table 44 for initial na
‘if; when; in order to' clauses and Table 45 for initial mali'when'clauses.",[400]
"118Chapter 3Adverbial Clauses Without Conjunctions3.0 Introduction
In Barbareho Chumash there are adverbial clauses that lack
conjunctions. The only indication of dependency, for the postposed tokens, is
the dependent proclitic hi=, which is attached at the beginning of the clause.
They do not have specific conjunctions like those found in the adverbial clause
types in chapters 4 through 16, which serve to specify the nature of the
semantic relation. Adverbial clauses that lack conjunctions sometimes have the
same morphosyntax as complement clauses. However, unlike complement
clauses, the adverbial clauses do not serve as arguments of a verb, nor do they
serve as constituents of a noun phrase. One determines which is which from
the grammatical and pragmatic context in which these clauses occur. At times
Harrington’s translations help disambiguate the context as well. Much more
difficult is the task of distinguishing between some of these conjunctionless
adverbial clause constructions and the two-verb predicate constructions we saw
in section 2.3.2 of chapter 2. Later in the chapter more will be said about the
similarities between these two constructions and whether they can be truly
distinguished.
The adverbial clauses illustrated in this chapter have a more limited
range of semantic meanings than the adverbial clause types that have
conjunctions. The former were found to code only purposive and temporal
relations.
Another difference with regard to meaning is that the nature of the
semantic relation can many times only be inferred from the context. The
temporal clause constructions, however, have morphosyntax and/or lexical
indicators that indicate the kind of temporal relation involved.
Adverbial clauses without conjunctions that code purposive relations
are discussed in 3.1. Those that code temporal clauses are discussed in 3.2.
3.1Clauses that code purposive relations
In a purposive relation, the adverbial clause signals the purpose of the
main clause agent’s actions. The conjunctionless adverbial clauses that code
this relation have several characteristics in common. First, they have the same
subject as the main clause. Second, both the purpose clause and the main
119clause retain full pronominal marking on the verb. One does not see the kind
of pronominal reduction that takes place in English same-subject purpose
clauses, as in the clause 'to go surfing' in 'he flew to Oahu to go surfing’.
Third, all of these purpose clauses are postposed, Fourth, all of the purpose
clauses have the proclitic hi=, which codes a dependent relation with the
main clause. Finally, a few of the tokens were found to have the future tense
prefix sa2-.
Several illustrations of these patterns are seen below. In (1) line c.
the conjunctionless adverbial clause is postposed and has a purpose relation
with the main clause in line b. Both clauses have the same third person plural
subject, which is indexed on the verbs with the third person plural subject
morphemes s-iy-. This adverbial clause happens to be followed bya Gu 'so
that, in order to'adverbial clause in line d., which also codes a purposerelation.","[140, 141, 142]"

cause any problems in understanding what the narrator was intending. Still,
since the main clause continues tracking the referent 'elder flower tea', and
the adverbial clause does not, the adverbial clause proposition has less
relevance to the preceding context than its main clause proposition does.
Hence,it doesnot intervenebetweenits mainclauseandthe materialpreceding it.
23.2.1.2 Referent tracking in the adverbial clauseThere are two tokens in which the main clause introduces a New
referent that continues to be tracked in the neutral adverbial clause as Given.
As we saw with final temporal clauses in chapter 22, the preferred order in
such circumstances is for the adverbial clause to be postposed, for reasons of
information flow and ease of cognitive processing.
In (26) and (27), the associated main clause introduces a full NP that
is coded as a third person subject in the adverbial clause with the third
pronominal prefix, s-. In (26), the main clause (line c.) introduces the
possessor NP 'a frog', whose referent is then coded as the subject in the
adverbial clause, ‘if/when it is angry’.

similar to the other mehu clauses in the kind of predicate that it has and the
kind of causal relation it codes. Like almost all other hehu reason clauses, theentity’s state of being is the cause of the state of affairs described in the main
clause. In this case, the inherent size of the sycamore tree burl is itself the
source or 'cause' of the size of the stuk that is going to be made.
15.4 Summary
Tables 23 - 26 on the following pages summarize some of the salient
patterns found in mehu 'because, since, from' adverbial clauses. Tables 23 32125 in particular highlight differences between mehu and kayké 'because'
clauses. One major difference between mehu and kayké clauses was the
frequency of same-subject and different-subject clauses, as summarized below
in Table 223

Another difference was found in pronominal subject marking. While
half of the same-subject kayké clauses lacked a subject pronoun, only 20%
(2 tokens) of the mehu clauses lacked a subject pronoun. One of those two
tokens was a nominalized reason clause, the other was the sole purpose clause
token. The distribution is summarized in Table 24.","[343, 344]"
"26112.1.1 Same-subject clauses
Same-subject Gukanu clauses rarely occur in the corpus. There are
only 7 (out of 27) tokens. In two cases the subject pronoun is retained in the
x
o6 law
then nthe
éukanu
clause, Gen
in the
other ininstances the subject pronoun is not retained. We
will first look at those cases in which the subject pronoun is retained.
12.1.1.1 Same-subject clauses in which the subject pronoun is retainedIn both instances where the subject pronoun is retained in a samesubject Gukanu clause, the main clause subject does not have control over
what it undergoes in the adverbial clause event. This is true even though the
main clause subject may instigate what eventually happens to itself in the
adverbialclause. In bothcases, the adverbial clause event concerns whathappens to the main clause subject as a result of ingesting cathartic or
hallucinogenic substances. The main clause subject thus lacks control over
what happens to itself in the adverbial clause event. This is reflected in the
morphosyntax by the fact that the adverbial clause retains subject marking on
the verb. For example, in (5), the main clause and the Gukanu clause have
the same subject and are indexed with the first person plural pronoun k-iy-.
The excerpt from the narrative depicts an ancient Chumash custom of
purifying oneself by drinking salt water from the ocean.

that they inevitably undergo in line b. Because the main clause subject lacks
control, the person marking in the adverbial clause is not suppressed. Hence
the adverbial clause retains same-subject person marking with k-iy- 'we'.
The example in (6) is the only other same-subject construction in which
the subject pronoun is retained in the adverbial clause. In the excerpt below,
262the main clause subject ingests some datura (also known as jimson weed) in
order to have a particular kind of vision, a vision in which he or she may
receive an 2atiSwin
(spirit helper), a special talent, or some other
advantage. The main clause subiect has no control over what he or she will
experience or receive in the adverbial clause event. According to Chumash
tradition, it is the datura (momoy) that determines what the person
experiences and receives during the vision. In the example below, the main
clause subject is an indefinite third person 'one/they', coded with the third
person subject pronoun s- and the indefinite prefix am- in line a. This same
pronoun likewise occurs in the adverbial clause in line b.

Distribution of adverbial clauses by position and semantic relation
Parts III and IV of this dissertation explore the differences and
similarities between preposed and postposed adverbial clauses in Barbareno
Chumash. In part III we will see how these two groups differ with respect to
scope, morphosyntactic structure, and intonation/punctuation boundaries with
the corresponding main clauses. In part IV we will examine the differences
and similarities between these two groups with respect to their discourse
functions in Barbareno Chumash narrative discourse.
Tense, aspect and modality in the marking of semantic relationsDifferent patterns emerged in the usage of tense, aspectual and modal
morphosyntax among the adverbial clause types. These patterns were linked
to the kinds of semantic relations coded by the clause types in question.
345In the coding of temporal relations, those clause types with semantically
specific conjunctions like 2akayhu'‘until' and 2akimpi‘during, while;when ' had very little tense and aspectual morphology. These two clause types,
however, generally coded one specific kind of temporal relation: terminal
temporal boundaries for 2akay
hu ‘until’ clauses and simultaneous
temporal relations for 2akimpi 'during, while; when' clauses. On the other
hand, those clause types with semantically general conjunctions like mali
‘when' and na ‘if; when; in order to' required a variety of morphemes,
including tense/aspect morphology and words with temporal meaning, in order
to code temporal relations. With such morphology at its disposal, we saw that
the mali'when'clause type, especially, could code several different kindsof temporal relations--precedence, subsequence, terminal boundaries, initial
boundaries, and simultaneous temporal boundaries. Each of these different
varieties of temporal relations were characterized by different tense and
aspectual morphemes, as well as different temporally-related lexical items.
Relative tense played a key role in coding precedence ('before') and
subsequence ('‘after') temporal relations. An adverbial clause that coded
precedence named an event that was future relative to the event named by
the main clause, and thus tended to have the future tense prefix sa?-. On the
other hand, an adverbial clause that coded subsequence denoted an event that
was past relative to the event denoted by the main clause, and thus tended to
have the past tense suffix -waS. We saw a preponderance of imperfective
aspectual morphology in the coding of simultaneous temporal relations, but
again usually only in those adverbial clauses that lacked semantically specific
conjunctions, such as maii 'when' clauses. Such adverbial clauses, as well as
their main clauses, often had reduplication in the verb, and/or affixes that
denoted duration, iteration, and habitual past. In some instances, certain
temporally-oriented lexical items occurred either in the adverbial clause or in
its main clause in lieu of any tense and aspectual morphology. Such lexical
items rendered a temporal interpretation to the adverbial clause. In other
instances, an adverbial clause was able to code a temporal relation without
any attendant temporally-oriented words and morphosyntax. In such instances
the pragmatic context of the adverbial clause would not allow any other
interpretation.
Regarding the adverbial clauses that coded conditional relations, one
tended to find one or more modal morphemes in the corresponding main
clauses. These were irrealis operators (using the terminology of Givén 1990)
which served to point to the hypothetical underpinnings of the conditional
relation. These included modal verbs like uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have
346to, should' or alaqway
may‘would;'can, be able, be possible ', and the modal particleshould; might'. One would also find, quite often, the futuretense prefix sa?-. Other modal operators in the consequent (main) clause

LLatparticle pA 'must be, must have, probably, likely', kalpas 'certainly', and
2inu 'true; surely'. Hortatory particles are included here, such as kume ‘let
it not be (that)...'. Sometimes, also, one would find the main clause having an
imperative verb, or the main clause itself would be a question. Finally, main
clauses in conditional relations were sometimes also found to have a special
particle, kimini 'then, in that case', which only occurs in conditional
relations.
Tense and aspectual morphology was found to be nearly non-existent
in those adverbial clauses that code purpose clauses, with one great exception:
if a purpose clause had any tense/aspect marking, it would have the future
tense prefix sa?-. In fact, for one clause type that codes purposive relations
100% of the time, the Gukanu'so that, in order to' clause type, the onlytense or aspectual morpheme that appears is the future tense prefix sa?-.
Also, 100% of the purpose clause tokens within the na ‘if; when; in order to'
and fehu'because, since, from; in order to'adverbial clause types hadfuture tense marking as well. On the other hand, none of the purpose clauses
were found to have past tense marking. Such patterning makes sense given the
crosslinguistic generalization about purposive relations in Thompson and
Longacre 1985: a purpose clause denotes an event that is unrealized at the
time of the event denoted by the main clause. Hence, events in purpose
clauses are typically future relative to the time of the events coded by the
corresponding main clauses. Future-tense morphology or some other kind of
irrealis marking is thus not unexpected in purpose clauses.
Unlike Barbareno adverbial clauses that code purposive relations,
Barbareno adverbial clauses that code reason relations were rarely found to
have future tense marking. It was not unusual, however, to find past tense
marking in reason clauses. The difference between purpose and reason clauses
with regard to tense patterning is again predicted in Thompson and Longacre
1985: the motivating event coded by a purpose clause has an unrealized status
relative to the main clause event, but the motivating event coded by a reason
clause may indeed already be realized by the time the main clause event
occurs. The event coded by a reason clause, then, can be past relative to the
time of the event coded by its main clause. However, an event coded by a
purpose clause is never past relative to its main clause event; rather, it occurs
in the future relative to the time of its main clause event. Barbareho Chumash
347grammar codes this semantic distinction in that reason clauses may have the
past tense suffix -waS but rarely the future tense prefix sa?-, while purpose
clauses may have the future tense prefix sa?- but never the past tense suffix
