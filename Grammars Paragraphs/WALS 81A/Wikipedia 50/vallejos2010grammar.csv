"72911.4. The pragmatics of constituent order patterns
Starting with Greenberg (1963), there has been a fundamental assumption in
linguistics that for a majority of languages it is possible to identify a “basic” order of
subject and object with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Nichols 1986, Dryer 1988,
among others). This constitutes one way of categorizing languages in typology.
However, what is basic and how to identify it remains debatable. None of the
standard strategies to detect basic word order — statistical frequency, descriptive
simplicity, and pragmatic neutrality —is without problems. As a result, some scholars
have questioned the universality of the very notion of basic word order; when languages
display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, some scholars
advocate asking a different question, namely “what is the communicative function of
one order, rather than another” (Mithun 1992, Payne 1990, 1992). Thus, the first
typological division should be made between those languages in which word order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors, and those in which word order primarily
correlates with pragmatic factors (Thompson 1978).
The speakers of KK have several constituent order patterns at their disposal, and
this section explores the factors that speakers take into consideration when choosing one
of those patterns at the moment of the utterance. It was found that some patterns are
used to mark certain pieces of information as pragmatically salient. Here I use salient in
the sense of Mithun‟s (1993) newsworthy, for referring to unexpected information (i.e.
which breaks shared cultural knowledge and expectations), answers to information
questions, restatements, topic shifting, etc. In Givón‟s words, salient information would730be considered more informative than non/less-salient information. Informativeness can
be seen as a composite of several parameters: it correlates with new as opposed to
given, indefinite as opposed to definite, contrastive as opposed to non-contrastive. In
general, it involves less predictable information (Givon 1983).
11.4.1. Available ordering patterns
As discussed in Chapters IX, §9.1.1, in KK word order partially defines the
syntactic role of an argument. Although neither tense nor aspect morphology is required
as part of a basic clause, a clause allows a different order of subject, object and verb
depending on whether or not it is marked for progressive aspect. The available patterns
are listed in Table 11.6; for examples that illustrate these patterns, please see Chapter
VIII.15

speakers are very aware of it. Because of their frequency in discourse, pronouns are
perhaps one of the most salient aspects of the grammar that reflects this gender system.

gender for first person singular, third person singular, first person plural exclusive, and
third person plural. The use of the correct set of pronouns signals whether someone is a42good speaker or not; it also indicates whether someone is in the process of learning the
language. Community members are ready to laugh at people —especially men— if
he/she uses the incorrect set.
This doesn‟t mean, of course, that men never use the female speech forms. For
instance, spontaneous speech is full of direct quotations, and if speakers are quoting
someone from the opposite gender, they have to switch to the appropriate set of forms.
The following fragment from a traditional story illustrates this. The speaker telling the
narrative is a man, who at a certain point —the last utterance in this extract— quotes a
woman. During the narrative the speaker consistently uses male speech forms, and for
the quote he switches to female speech forms, including the demonstrative ajan (instead
of ikian) and the first person pronoun etse (instead of ta). Immediately after the quote,
the speaker goes back to the male form (ra „third singular‟). The relevant pieces are in
bold.

of the language. Interestingly, this type of gender-based distinction is also found in
other language considered Tupí-Guaraní outsider, such as Aweti (Drude, 2002). In
Awetí, for instance, the distinctions show up in the paradigm of pronouns, prefixes,
deictics and lexicon. This topic clearly deserves further, comparative research.
1.5.2. Constituent orderings
The language does not display case marking or verb agreement to express
grammatical relations; instead, subject and object are defined by their position with
respect to the verb. Verbal clauses display different orders of subject, object and verb
depending on whether they are marked by tense or the progressive aspect (see Chapter
XIX). Importantly, clauses not marked for tense-aspect pattern with clauses marked by
tense, differently from constructions marked by the progressive. Table 1.5 presents a
summary of constituent order patterns attested in the language, where, S, A, and O refer
to subject of intransitive, subject of transitive, and object of transitive, respectively
(Dixon 1979); subscript T stands for a tense clitic, and subscript P for the progressive
verbal suffix.

for a majority of languages it is possible to identify a “basic” order of subject and object44with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Dryer 1992, among others). This has constituted
a way of categorizing languages in typology. However, what is basic in terms of order
and how to identify it remains debatable. As a consequence, some scholars have
suggested that the first typological division should be made between those languages in
which word order primarily correlates with pragmatic factors, and those in which order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors (Thompson 1978). Thus, in languages
which display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, it should
be asked “what is the communicative function of one order, rather than another” (Payne
1990, 1992). In order to answer this question, explanatory factors beyond syntax, such as
information structure and pragmatics, must be taken into consideration. The case of
Kokama-Kokamilla is interesting because both grammatical relations and pragmatics play
a prominent role in the distribution of the different order patterns.
1.5.3. The syntax-discourse interface
KK highlights points of theoretical interest regarding discourse-pragmatic issues.
The language displays interesting patterns of interaction between information structure
and syntax. Although word order is perhaps one of the main strategies for expressing
discourse-pragmatic factors, there are several other components playing a role within
specific constructions. For instance, tense-marked clauses, aspect-marked clauses, and
clauses unmarked for tense and aspect have a skewed distribution in discourse, and the
driving factor is the background/foreground narrative distinction (Vallejos 2007). Another
issue concerns the distribution of pronominal forms. The language exhibits three sets of
pronominal forms: free long form pronouns, short form free pronouns, and enclitics. The45choice between these forms is iconically motivated: short form pronouns occur by default,
typically refering to information which is low in salience; clitics are the further reductions
of short forms, used to refer to recurring participants in core grammatical relations; long
forms are used for highlighting certain aspects of a complex experience, and to attract the
hearer‟s attention to one part of a sentence (Vallejos 2005). Further, informationstructural distinctions, such as argument focus, predicate focus and predication focus, are
signaled by the interaction of word order, morphological markers, and prosody (Vallejos
2009). Topics dealing with the syntax-discourse interface are discussed in Chapter XI.
Now that the major features of the language have been highlighted, I turn the
discussion to the theoretical orientation and descriptive notions employed to describe
the language.
1.6. Theoretical framework
This section starts with an introduction to the Functional-Typological approach to
language study, which is the theoretical perspective this dissertation follows (§0). I also
present the basic notions of Construction Grammar, which prove relevant to the
description of KK (§1.6.2). A literature review of grammatical relations is offered
towards the end of this section (§1.6.3). Other theoretical notions necessary to describe
specific aspects of KK are introduced at relevant points throughout the dissertation.
1.6.1. The functional-typological approach to language
The Functional-Typological approach treats language in terms of both its
adaptive motivation —i.e., as a tool for conceptualization and communication between
human beings— and its typological diversity —i.e., recurrent cross-linguistic patterns.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"
"Distinguishing subject from objectIn KK, subject and object exhibit some differences and some similarities. They
differ from each other in the following respects:
i)in unmarked basic clauses, the subject precedes the verb, while the
object follows it.ii)they occupy different hierarchical positions in terms of constituency:
subject is external and object internal to the verb phraseiii)for third person, subject and object are expressed by means of different
pronominal formsiv)they show asymmetrical properties for access to relativizationHowever, subject and object share the following features:
i)they are obligatorily overt in basic clausesii)they are morphologically unmarked (Except 3sg. pronoun)iii)they occupy an almost-fixed position, surrounding the verbiv)they each control coreference in specific complex constructionsIn the following paragraphs, I elaborate on each of the features listed above,
starting with the ways in which subjects and objects differ from each other. Their
similarities are discussed in §9.2.1.2, where, as core arguments, they are distinguished
from obliques.
The first parameter in which subjects differ from objects is in their position with
respect to the verb. As shown in §9.1.1, KK cannot have “free” word order. Because
order is what determines the interpretation of subject and object, arguments must occur511in specific positions adjacent to the verb. Within the non-progressive construction type
(i.e., clauses unmarked for tense and aspect), in intransitive clauses the subject precedes
the verb: [SUBJ V]. That is, the intransitive construction requires a noun phrase (59a) or
a pronoun (59b) fulfilling the subject argument function, plus a verb that can combine
with this argument structure construction.

b. etse
yachu
1SG.L.F
cry
„I cry‟ (ED)
c. tsa=yamimi
1SG.F=hide
„I hide‟ (ED)
As illustrated above, the subject could be a full NP like mukuika tsayatsu‘twopeccaries‟ (59a), or a pronoun, either unbound like etse „I‟ (59b) or cliticized to the
verb, like tsa= „I‟ in (7c).
In contrast to intransitives, transitive constructions include two NPs —one of
which operates as the subject and the other as the object— and a verb that combines
with this argument structure construction. In the pragmatically unmarked transitive
construction, the subject precedes the verb and object follows it. Schematically, it could
be summarized as [SUBJ [V OBJ]]. This pattern is illustrated in (60), where both
subject and object are expressed by means of full noun phrases.

Recall that in the pragmatically marked transitive construction, the focalized
object appears in sentence-initial position, followed by the subject and the verb: [OBJ
SUBJ V] (see examples in (3), above). Up to here we can generalize that, in the
non-progressive construction type, the subject always precedes the verb, and the object
either follows the verb or appears fronted.
Subject and object also differ with respect to the third person pronominal forms,
depending on whether the pronoun is functioning as subject or object (61). Importantly,
a nominative/accusative distinction in pronouns is found in both male (61) and female
speech (62).
(61)a. uri / ra
chikari=ura
(male speech)
3SG.L.M / 3SG.M look.for=3SG.M.OBJ

3SG.F
look.for=3F.OBJ
„He/she looks for he/she/it‟(female speech)b. ya
tsatsatsɨma
3SG.F
scream
„He/she screams‟
In (61a), both the long form pronoun uri as well as the short form ra „he/she‟
can operate as the subject, and as such they come before the verb chikari „look for‟. In
contrast, the clitic =ura „he/she/it‟ is the object, and hence appears cliticized after the513verb. In the intransitive clause in (61b), uri/ra operate as the subject, whereas *ura is
rejected. In (62a), the distribution of the pronouns is similar, but the forms correspond
to the female speech paradigm: while the subject short form pronoun ya appears in
initial position, the object enclitic =ay attaches to the verb. In (62b), ya operates as the
subject of the instransitive clause. For the complete paradigm of KK pronominal forms,
see §5.3.
A third feature that distinguishes subjects from objects is their positioning with
respect to the verb phrase. In clauses with the SVO order, VO forms a syntactic unit,
i.e., the verb phrase. In what follows, I demonstrate that there is a tight relationship
between the verb and the O argument.
The first evidence for a verb phrase is the distribution of tense clitics. Tense
markers cliticize to the rightmost element in the VP: the intransitive verb (63a) and the
transitive verb in the pragmatically marked OSV pattern. When O is focused, as in
(63b), O comes in first position in the sentence but the tense marker remains on the
verb. In the pragmatically unmarked SVO order, the tense marker cannot be attached to
any other element than the object (63c-e).

*S [V O LOC]-TA second piece of evidence for constituency comes from the insertion test: a
group of words that behaves as a syntactic unit avoids being interrupted by clause-level
elements, such as adverbs. To find out if a particular argument is part of the verb phrase
or not, I use the temporal adverb ikun „today‟ between each pair of words, looking for
grammatical sentences. If the result is rejected by speakers, then I conclude that the
word(s) on the right of the temporal word cannot be separated from the one(s) on the
left, and that therefore, they must belong to the same constituent. If the result produces a
well formed sentence, then I conclude that the words on the left and right of the
adverbial belong to two separate units. Examples in (64) show that the temporal adverb
ikun „today‟ (in bold) can be moved to different positions in the sentence, except
between the verb and the object.

c. ?mui [karuta mijiri]=uy ikun ku=kuara
d.?? mui ikun [karuta mijiri]=uy ku=kuara
e. *mui [karuta ikun mijiri]=uy ku=kuara
The five examples are in (64), ranked according to the speakers‟ preference. Wecan see that „today‟ is most felicitous at the beginning of the clause (64a), although it515can also go readily at the very end of the clause (64b). Less likely, it can go between
OBJ and the following locative (64c). The reason speakers do not like it here is because
they prefer to avoid the sequence tense clitic - temporal adverb; if the clause is
unmarked for tense, then ikun is perfectly fine between the object and the locative.
Speakers will allow, but strongly prefer not to place a temporal adverb between the
subject and the verb (64d). Finally, speakers categorically do not allow ikun between V
and the object (64e). Thus, based on the distribution of tense clitics and temporal
adverbs, we can conclude that [V OBJ] comprises a syntactic unit. As a result, while the
object is the internal argument to the VP, subject is the external argument.
Another parameter in which subject and object show asymmetrical properties is
with respect to accessing relativization. Relativization of the subject of a transitive
clause (the A argument) is achieved by means of a relativizer morpheme -tara (65b). In
contrast, the relativization of the object is done by nominalizing the embedded clause
with the suffix -n (65c). Note that relativization of S employs the same strategy to
relativize O (65d). For a detailed discussion on relative clauses, please see §10.3.

are also alike in various respects. The fact that they share several features makes them a
category that here is referred to as core arguments (S, A, and O), in opposition to
obliques, as discussed in the next section.
9.2.1.2. Core arguments and obliques
This section examines the number and types of arguments within simple verbal
constructions. Core arguments are understood as the participants required overtly within
a particular construction (Croft, 2002; Goldberg, 1995, 2006). In what follows, I present
a brief description of the properties of core arguments and obliques in KK, in order to
show the ways in which they behave differently.7
First, core arguments occupy relatively fixed positions, whereas oblique phrases
can be moved around in the clause without semantic or syntactic consequences.
Comparing the examples in (66), we can see that the locative phrase can occur in final
position (66a, b) or initial position (66c), without semantic consequences.","[540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546]"
"4649.1. Simple verbal clause construction
In KK, the most basic verbal construction consists of a subject (full lexical NP or
pronoun) and an intransitive verb. However, a number of other elements can also occur
within declarative clauses. Two of the most important grammatical categories that can
potentially occur in declarative sentences are tense and modality. Additional,
complementary information is expressed by means of postpositional phrases, and
adverbs of manner, location and tense (see Chapter XI). Frequent clause-level particles
include focus markers and intensifiers (see Chapter IV). In Figure 9.1 I put these
categories together in order to offer an overall look at their distribution in the clause.

=míaI want to highlight that Figure 9.1 represents the most frequent, pragmatically
unmarked structure, though many others are possible, as will be showed in §9.1.1.
Tense clitics have been mentioned in several places already. Here we focus on their
functional semantics (§9.1.1.3). An additional point I would like to draw some
attention to is the fact that the language has two sets of morphemes that indicate
modality. The first set (MOD1) are second position clitics, as such they attach to
whichever element occurs sentence initially. In Figure 9.1, ADV appears in first
position, so MOD1 attaches to it; however, any other first position element would serve465equally well as the host of MOD1. The second set (MOD2) consists of two verb phrase
enclitics. Both sets of modality markers are discussed in (§9.1.2). It should be also
noted that adverbs and oblique phrases are not restricted to appear one per clause, nor
are they restricted to the syntactic positions indicated in Figure 9.1. For instance,
postpositional phrases often appear fronted in the clause. As for adverbs, they appear in
several other positions, including at the end of the clause, or right after the verb phrase.
9.1.1. Constituent order
The pragmatically unmarked clause displays SVO order. As discussed in
Chapter VI, circumstantial information (CI), if any, occurs in peripheral positions by
means of postpositional phrases and/or adverbial elements. In simple clause
constructions, explicit arguments are required in order to have well-formed clauses. In
only a few complex constructions, such as complement clauses, can equi-subjects be
left out of the clause (see Chapter X, §10.2 for more details). Thus, the structure of an
unmarked clause could be roughly summarized as: (CI) S V (O) (CI). Importantly,
circumstantial information does not occur between SV or VO (Vallejos, 2010).
Despite the strong supremacy of the SVO pattern in discourse, the language
allows several other orders of subject, object and verb depending on the marking of
progressive aspect marking. That is, different ordering patterns correlate with tense and
progressive aspect. Explanatory factors need to be taken into consideration to account
for the distribution of the set of available patterns in the language. The pragmatic forces
that trigger the use of a particular order instead of another are discussed in §11.4 and
§11.5.","[493, 494, 495]"
"481.6.2. Construction grammar
According to Constructionist approaches, constructions are “learned pairings of
form with semantic or discourse function, including morphemes or words, idioms,
partially lexically filled, and general phrasal patterns.” (Goldberg 2006:5). That is,
constructions are represented as symbolic units in their own right, just as lexical items
such as verbs are. It follows that, within this view, lexicon and grammar are not distinct
components, but form a continuum of constructions. Since evidence for categorization
is also found beyond language, contrary to the nativist view, construction grammar
posits that children learn constructions from the input; that is, they make generalizations
from instances.
Further, constructions form an interrelated network. For instance, simple clause
constructions reflect scenes basic to human experience, “such as that of someone
causing something to move or change state, someone experiencing something,
something moving, and so on” (Goldberg 1995:5). Goldberg (1995) emphasizes that a
linguistic pattern must be recognized as a construction as long as some aspect of its
form, meaning, or function is not predictable from its component parts or from other
constructions that exist in a given language. She adds, however, that patterns are stored
even if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with sufficient frequency. Given
the following sentences:
(3)a. Joe bought a book
b. Joe bought Tom a book
c. Joe gave Tom a bookTransitive construction
Ditransitive construction
Ditransitive construction49While (3a) entails getting an item, (3b) entails getting an item plus intended
transfer of it. According to non-constructionist approaches, the form and general
interpretation of basic sentence patterns of a language are determined by semantic
and/or syntactic information specified by the main verb. Thus, buy in (3b) does not
mean the same thing as buy in (3a), and so there must be a rule deriving buy in (3b)
from buy in (3a), which allows it to be used with the appropriate meaning in the
construction in (3b).
On the contrary, within the constructionist approach the meaning of (3a) and
(3b) are determined by the constructions themselves. The additional component of
meaning in (3b) is analyzed not as a part of the lexical content of the verb, but as a part
of the meaning of the Ditransitive construction. That is, in English, the Ditransitive
construction is an independently represented syntactic unit. As such, it possesses its
own semantics —<X CAUSES Y to RECEIVE Z>, as well as its own form —[SUB V
OBJ1 OBJ2]. However, note that, although (3b) and (3c) are both Ditransitive
constructions, the contribution of the construction is slightly different for buy and for
give. While (3c) entails actual transfer of possession, (3b) only implies transfer of
possession. Goldberg (1995:31) resolves this problem by proposing that constructions
can be polysemous. That is, a single construction can have two meanings that are
semantically related. Typically, one meaning is a historical extension of the other
meaning.
Within the constructional view, constructions are not derived from another
construction, but can involve a combination of several others, or inherit features from50others. For instance, What did Joe buy? involves the ditransitive construction, the
question construction, the Subject-Auxiliary inversion construction, etc. (Goldberg
2006:10). Importantly, to account for speakers‟ full knowledge of language, a usagebased model is required. Construction grammar aims to account not only for what has
been called the “core” grammar, but also for those apparently idiosyncratic patterns that
other theories have demoted to the periphery. As mentioned above, constructionists do
not endorse the autonomous view of syntax. Reference to SUBJ, OBJ, V, etc. appeal to
a relevant level of description; or, as Croft (2001) puts it, they are “metageneralizations
over construction-specific categories.”
1.6.3. Grammatical relations: an overview
Although most syntactic descriptions have assumed that, in addition to semantic
and pragmatic roles, there are also purely syntactic grammatical relations, we can find
two different ways of understanding them: i) as syntactic primitives; and, ii) as derived
notions. However, what are they derive from is a second point of divergence.
For the theory of Relational Grammar, grammatical relations are theoretical
primitives (Perlmutter 1978, 1980, 1982). Accordingly, Relational Grammar makes the
following universal assumption about the nature of clause structure: “A clause consists
of a network of grammatical relations. Among these relations are „subject of‟, „direct
object of‟, and „indirect object of‟” (Perlmutter & Postal 1986:9), which are named as 1,
2, and 3, respectively. Within this approach, a formal representation of Naomi gave that
book to me, would be (Perlmutter & Postal 1986:12, ex. 22):5155
P c11 c12 c13 c1gaveNaomithat bookmeFollowing this approach, any given language must display grammatical
relations. Further, any language must have clauses that contain one, two, and three
grammatical relations. However, empirical evidence shows that grammatical relations
or at least not all three of them, do not play a central role in every language.
A second way of understanding grammatical relations is as derived notions. For
early Transformational theory (Chomsky 1965), grammatical relations derive from
syntactic phrase structure. As such, subject and object have configurational definitions.
While subject is the NP immediately dominated by S (later called the external
argument), object was the NP immediately dominated by VP (later called the internal
argument). Within this tradition, there was neither a definition nor structural notion of
indirect object. In the figure below, from ([Aspects 1965] Van Valin 2002:244), Kim is
the subject, and the book is the object.
S

NVP
VNPPPARTNKim gave thebook52PNPN
to SandyThe above definitions have the following implications: every language must
have a VP, and the verb and the object must be adjacent. Neither is transparently true
for free word order languages.
A third major conception, the Functional-Typological perspective, claims that
grammatical relations derive from the interaction and grammaticalization of semantic or
pragmatic relations. For Functional Grammar, different choices for subject and object
represent different perspectives or vantage points (Dik 1989). In Cognitive Grammar
(Langacker 1990), subject and object reflect a more general trajector/landmark
asymmetry, which is a linguistic instantiation of the even more general psychological
contrast between figure and ground. Other positions functionally associate subject with
mental starting point (DeLancey 1981, Chafe 1994, Mithun 1999), and subject with
attention (Tomlin 1995, 1997). For Givón (1984, 1995, 2001), subject and object are
grammaticalized pragmatic roles. Givón claims that subject is the “primary topic,”
object is the “secondary topic.” In Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan & Kanerva
1989), the assignment of grammatical relations is based on Lexical Mapping Theory.
Subject and object are constituted by two primitive semantic features (±r: restricted in
terms of semantic roles; ±o: able to complement transitive predicators but not
intransitive predicators). What these approaches have in common is that the assignment
of subject and object is based upon a hierarchy of semantic roles. Among the proposed
hierarchies are Dik‟s (1989) Semantic Function Hierarchy, Givón‟s (1984) Topic
Accession Hierarchy, and Bresnan & Kanerva‟s (1989) Thematic Role Hierarchy. Such
hierarchies are interpreted as determining preferred accessibility to grammatical53relations. For instance, in the Topic Accession Hierarchy (Givón 1984:139), given in
(4), if there is an agent, then the agent is the subject, if not, then dative/benefactive is
the subject, and so on.
(4) Agent >Dative/Benefactive>Patient>Locative >Instrument/Associative>Manner adverbs
One theoretical question, however, remains controversial: are grammatical
relations universal? Some functionalists such as Dixon (1994) and Givón (1997) assume
subject as a universal category, whereas Dryer (1997) and Mithun & Chafe (1999) take
a more skeptical position. DeLancey notes that, “Givon claims that there is a universal
function, while Dryer denies that there is a universal structural category of subject; both
could quite possibly be correct” (2003b:152)
I assume that grammatical relations are neither primitive nor derived from
syntactic phrase structure. Functional-typological theories insist that evidence for
grammatical relations must be based upon language-particular morphosyntactic
properties (Queixalós 1998, 2010). Comrie (1991) points out that “in order to say that a
given grammatical relation exists in a given language this claim must be justified both
language-internally and cross-linguistically”. Based on Keenan‟s (1976) work on the
properties of subjects, the formal features associated with grammatical relations are
divided into two main types: i) coding properties (word order, verb agreement, and case
marking), and ii) behavior & control properties (which define the role of the NP in
given grammatical constructions). Behavior and control properties, as syntactic
phenomena, are sometimes considered more relevant than coding properties and given
prevalence when defining grammatical relations. This is explicit, for example, in Van54Valin (2002:274) who says “grammatical relations exist in a language only where the
behavioral patterns of a language give evidence of a syntactic relation independent of
semantic and pragmatic relations.” Constructions often mentioned to show evidence for
grammatical relations (e.g. passivization, relativization, reflexivization, cross-reference
tracking, possessor raising, purposive constructions, coordinate constructions, etc.) must
be identified language specifically.
However, the amount and kind of evidence needed to argue for the existence of
grammatical relations seems controversial. For instance, for Comrie, “a number of
logically independent criteria must be established that serve to identify the grammatical
relation in question as being syntactically significant in the language in question”
(Comrie 1991:66). However, Van Valin (2002:205) argues that “there are purely
syntactic grammatical relations in a language if there is at least one construction with a
restricted neutralization of semantic and pragmatic relations for syntactic purposes.”
While some authors want a set of multiple criteria, others find one construction is
enough evidence to posit a grammatical relation.
Although there is some controversy around grammatical relations even within
the Functional-Typological approaches, there seems to be a general sense that subject
and (direct) object are the most central relations and display more grammatical
consequences in most languages. In contrast, indirect object occupies an intermediate
status (compared to subject/object and obliques) in terms of number of languages that
have it as a clear category (Givón 2001:108). Cross-linguistic properties associated with
indirect objects may not exist. In consequence, in some languages, the status of indirect55objects is dubious. Usually clause elements that are called indirect objects have the
same formal properties as either direct objects or obliques (Comrie 1991:67-68, T.
Payne 1997:379). This study adds to the literature on languages that show convincing
evidence for subject and object, but not for indirect object, or for a grammatical “second
object” of any kind.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]"

pronominal forms become crucial for the determination of subject and object.",[539]

"4669.1.1.1. Word order and tense
Grammatical tense, described in more detail in §9.1.1.3, is expressed by means
of a system of enclitics that occur at the end of the verb phrase (VP). In intransitive
constructions the tense clitic attaches to the verb (1); in transitive constructions, it
attaches to the object (2). For instance, in (1a) the past tense =uy appears attached to the
verb ukɨrɨ „sleep‟ and, in (1b) to umanu „die‟. However, in (2a) the tense marker comes
after tsa mena „my husband,‟ and in (2b), it follows maniri „Manuel.‟ Although (3a)
contains a transitive verb, the object is fronted, and so the tense clitic attaches directly
to the verb. In tense-marked constructions, allowable order patterns are SV (1a, b),
SVO (2a, b), and OSV (3a, b), but, importantly, not *SOV (3b). Clauses unmarked for
tense and aspect pattern like tense clauses (non-progressive constructions, from now
on). Thus, the order patterns in (1) to (3) work equally well with or without the tense
clitics.
(1)a.","[495, 496]"
"Declarative sentences
In KK, declarative sentences can be considered the unmarked constructioncompared to interrogatives and imperatives. The reasons for that claim are the
following:
i)Declarative clauses are morphologically unmarked; interrogatives and
imperatives can be characterized as some morphosyntactic operations on
declarative clauses, such as the addition of an interrogative morpheme,
change of the basic word order, omission of subject, etc.ii)Declarative clauses are the most frequent construction in the database.iii)Declarative clauses overwhelmingly exhibit the SVO pattern, which is
considered the basic constituent order in the language (see §11.4).iv)With the appropriate context, declarative clauses can express other
speech acts, including interrogation and requests.",[539]
"567At the sentence level, they conjoin sentences to indicate various semantic relationships;
at the discourse level they link sentences into chunks, like sequences, episodes, etc.
10.1 . Finite verbal clause vs. nominalized clause
In KK, two types of syntactic structures can operate as embeded clauses: finite
declarative verbal clauses, and nominalized clauses. In this study, clause nominalization
refers to the process in which a finite verbal clause is converted into a noun phrase (cf.
Givón 2001:24). As discussed in Chapter VI, §6.1.1, in KK finiteness does not pertain
to the verb per se. Finite verbs need not be morphologically marked; that is to say, no
piece of verbal morphology is obligatory. Thus, in KK, finiteness is fundamentally a
grammatical feature of clauses rather than of verbs.
In KK, finite clauses are found in complementation, whereas nominalized
clauses are found in relativization. In terms of constituent order, finite declarative
clauses are overwelmingly SVO, whereas nominalized clauses are verb final. In finite
clauses, the verb can take several aspectual and valence changing suffixes, whereas the
set of verbal morphemes attested within nominalized clauses is more limited. To derive
nominalized clauses, the verb takes the morphemes -n or -tara; although more
marginally, the progressive -ari, and the gerund -wa can also function as clause
nominalizers. After the verbs take one of the two nominalizers, they are able to take any
other morphology associated with nouns, such as the diminutive, the augmentative,
plural, etc. In terms of syntax, in finite clauses the verb is the head of the clause,
whereas in nominalized clauses the verb becomes the head of the resulting noun phrase
and the notional subject is encoded as a possessor. Finally, finite clauses take modal568clitics, whereas nominalized clauses do not. Table 10.1 summarizes the features in
which finite clauses contrast with nominalized clauses.

"Juxtaposition: attributive, equative & proper inclusion functions
The juxtaposition construction consists of a sequence of two elements withoutany relational or copular element between the two. The fist element is a NP subject,
whereas the second element, the predicate, can be a simply NP (§1), a yara-marked NP
(§8.1.2) a nominalized stative verb (§8.1.3) and more marginally a purpose phrase
(§8.1.4). From a functional perspective, these constructions are associated primarily
with attributive, equative and proper inclusion meanings. An additional construction
that serves equative and identificational purposes is discussed in (§8.1.5).
8.1.1. Juxtaposition of noun phrases: [NP NP]
The juxtaposition construction consists of an NP naming a referent, followed by
a second NP, which is the predicate, without any relational element. The order is
subject-predicate. Examples (1a-c) give equative predicates.
(1)a. [uri]

Miguel

„Miguel is my son‟ (ED)
Note that the first NP could be a pronoun (1a), a demonstrative (1b) or a full NP
(1c). As for the NP predicate, they are all full noun phrases; examples (1a-c) include a
possessor pronoun as modifier of the head noun.
Examples (2a-c) illustrate proper inclusion predicates.

When a speaker was asked for a construction like „I am a woman‟, she gave(2a). It is possible to take out kukama in this context; but according to the speaker, the
sentence makes more sense with it. Compare (2a) and (2b) noting the difference with
respect to word order. When kukama is the modifier of „woman‟, it goes before the
modified element (2a). However, when kukama is the predicate, it goes after the noun
as an independent constituent (2b). In this type of construction it is possible to reverse
the order of NPs; however, the structure, juxtaposition of NPs, remains the same. Thus,
in (3a) and (3b) we have the reversed order of (2b) and (2c), respectively. While in (2)
they were proper inclusion predicates, for the semantics of (3) now they seem equatives.
This is because the order subject-predicate still holds.","[453, 454]"

A first attempt to formulate the structure of these NPs would be: NP = [N=pura
RC=pura]. Notice, however, that each element can also be marked by plural (23b). Also,
there is stress on each pura-marked piece, but there is no pause between them. This
suggests that in constructions like (23) the head and the RC are each behaving as
independent syntactic units on their own. At the same time, they function together as
either the subject or object of the clause. Thus, a better interpretation of the complex
NPs in (23) is that they consist of two NPs in an appositive relationship. That is: NP =
[NP NP]. The appositive NPs have the same referent, which in the communicative
context happens to be in focus. In consequence, the examples in (23) are additional
cases of narrow focus.
With respect to the pragmatic structure of the above examples, constituent order is
crucial for the type of focus being coded. While (22a), (23a) and (23c) display canonical
order SV(O) and yield non-contrastive interpretations, (22b) and (23b) have noncanonical order OSV and bear contrastive interpretations. For instance, sentence (23a)
comes from a narrative about the yacurunas, and is produced when the speaker is700narrating that when she was at her farm, she heard people screaming. She points out that
at the beginning she did not know who was screaming. Then she realized that the ones
screaming were calling „her‟ and happened to be „they‟, her children. Since „they‟ and
„the scared ones‟ have the same referent and this is in focus, the speaker marks both
pieces with =pura. Example (23b) comes from the same narrative about the yacurunas.
Up to this point of the narrative, possible candidates for being called by the yacurunas
introduced by the speaker are her children and her neighbors. Here the speaker asserts
that these aquatic creatures where calling to „her children‟.
(23a‟) Presupposition: <X call>; assertion: <X=they, the scared ones>
(23b‟) Presupposition: <they call X>; assertion: <X=the children who stayed at home>
Set of alternatives: <children, neighbors, someone else>
Up to here we have seen that the scope of =pura is a NP usually in the O
argument function. Depending on the constituent order of the construction, the focus is
modifying what is perceived to be a wrong variable-instantiation, or filling a presumed
gap in the addressee‟s knowledge. Importantly, in KK narrow focus constructions, the
focused element correlates with the prosodic peak within the intonation unit. This
changes in the next section, which examines the different interaction between =pura
and stress used to encode broad focus.
11.2.4. =pura and broad focus
This section examines the contribution of =pura in broad focus constructions.
The construction for focusing the whole predication is a combination of two devices:
the morpheme =pura, and focal stress. In natural discourse, especially in narratives, big
chunks of oral material are produced with no pauses or interruptions. Those situations701call for strategies to mark information packaging. Crosslinguistic evidence indicates
that focal stress tends to be located towards the end of the focus constituent (Halliday
1967, Ladd 1978). Lambrecht (1994:247) specifies that a fundamental principle of
information structure is that “a sentence accent marks the END of a semantic domain,
whose BEGINNING is marked by non-prosodic means.” In contrast to accent, the
presence of particles, or clitics, with distinctive syntax or an especially heavy functional
load has been reported as a prominent feature for signaling information structure of
languages from lowland South America (see Dooley 1990, Derbyshire 1986, Wise
1986, Jensen 1982, among others). Dooley (1990) proposes the term spacer for particles
whose function is to signal divisions in the information structuring of the utterance. In
sentence focus constructions, =pura assumes this delimitative function.
11.2.4.1.=pura as a spacerIn sentence-focus constructions, the NP to which =pura attaches usually
functions as the subject (more likely S than A) of the main clause. In terms of encoding,
the constituent order is unmarked, =pura attaches to the subject NP, and the focal stress
occurs at the end of the verb phrase, usually the verb. The construction could be
summarized as: [S=pura V].
In examples (24-25), the portion under focus is the whole predication.

In the discourse preceding (24), the speaker is talking about illegal fishing, theability of the robbers, the incompetence of the guards, etc. In (24b), she introduces „the
government‟ and comments on it in the subsequent portion of the discourse. Note that
the propositional content of (24b) is not taken for granted or presupposed; that is, the
whole proposition is the focus of assertion. In the same vein, there is not a specific
presupposition for (25a-b). The context is the following: a woman avoids everybody‟s
company while working at the farm, including her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law
suspects the woman is hiding a secret and decides to spy on her. One day she follows
her daughter-in-law and when she arrives to the farm, the only thing she sees is a huge
turtle working. In this context, (25a) and (25b) are answering the question: and what
happens next? Examples like (24b) are often called “presentational sentences” and (25ab) “event-reporting sentences” or “thetic sentences.” The first type introduces a new
entity into the discourse, the second type an event. Both share the fact that the subject of
the sentence is not the topic11 of the discourse.","[729, 730, 731, 732]"

9.1.1.2. Word order and progressive aspect
In progressive constructions, allowable constituent order patterns are SV (4a),
VS (4b), SOV (5a), but *OSV (5b). In contrast to tense, aspect is expressed through
several strategies, including inflection, derivation, reduplication, and auxiliaries (see
Chapter VII). However, the strategy that shows certain correlations with constituent
order is the inflectional suffix -(a)ri „progressive‟. Recall from §7.2.2.1 that, contrary to
tense clitics, the progressive always suffixes to the verb and closes the verbal word.

a pronoun that follows the verb (unless it is generic in which case it is left unexpressed,
as in (19c)). My conclusion is thus that wanakari belongs to a set of ambivalente verbs
with respect to syntactic transitivity (see Chapter IX): If the order is directed to
someone specific, then the object is specified (19a-b); but if in a meeting where several
people are making noises, someone says „shut up‟, then the addressee object would be
left unexpressed (19c).
Similarly, the examples in (20-21) show quotes with the utterance verbs kumitsa

As is typical of adverbial clauses, in KK there is no requirement for any
arguments of purpose clauses marked with -tsen to share any arguments with the main
clause; in other words, the main clause and the purpose clause may or may not share
arguments. As might be expected, no argument is missing in the -tsen adverbial clause;
they are always explicitly stated, whether or not co-reference occurs. The arguments in
the main clause are expressed by either pronominals or full NPs, and if an argument is
shared, in the purpose clause it is generally indicated by an anaphoric pronoun, but not
by zero.
Another important feature that separates tsen-clauses from -tara/mira clauses is
to word order. Recall that -tara/mira clauses were verb final. On the contrary, tsenclauses exhibit SVO order. That is, like in the default order for main clauses, the object
follows the verb marked by -tsen, schematically: [S V-tsen O (OBL)].
Examples provided in (80) involve intransitive verbs in the purpose clause. Note
that in both examples, there is a proclitic pronoun attached to the subordinate verb to
indicate the subject. In (80a-b), note that a postpositional phrase follows the tsenmarked verb.

nominalized and becomes the possessed element of „you‟. In (84c), the purpose clause
„to shoot‟ is nominalized and turns into a headless relative clause „(the one) who goes to
hunt‟.
Similar nominalized patterns are found with mira-clauses as well. In (85a), the
purpose clause „to drink‟ is nominalized to operate as the possessed element of „turtles‟;
In (85b), „for you to know‟ is nominalized and is interpreted as „your knowledge.‟

The functions of the three purpose clauses, i.e., their propositional semantics, are
quite similar. That is, they convey the purpose, motivation, explanation, etc. for the
realization of the event indicated in the matrix clause. The formal properties of purpose
clauses discussed present more differences, as summarized in Table 10.5.

Throughout this chapter, the term intonation will be associated with speech acts
(declarative, imperative, interrogative, etc.), word stress with lexical items (as assigned
by phonological rules), and focal stress (or prosodic peak, sentence accent) with
utterances. Focal stress is driven by information structure (focus, activation, etc.), and
is said to coincide with, or override, lexical stress (Lambrecht 1994:240).
As explained in Chapter III (§3.3), in KK word stress has a delimitative
function, occurring on the penultimate syllable of the word, unless the word ends in a
consonant in which case it occurs on the final syllable. In terms of intonation, certain
contours are associated with pragmatically unmarked declarative sentences: a slightly
homogeneous volume plus decline in both at the end of intonation units. However, focal
stress—characterized as raising pitch (F0) and volume, plus optional lengthening of
vocalic segments — proves more relevant for this paper. For the remainder of this
chapter, when I use the term stress, I intend it to refer only to focal stress.
Unmarked focus constructions do not exhibit a strong focal stress in any
constituent. In the language, focal stress can be characterized as raising pitch (F0) &
volume, and, optionally, lengthening vocalic segments. Also, certain intonation
contours can be associated with unmarked structures: slightly homogeneous pitch level
and volume plus decline at the end of intonation units. Consider examples (2a-c) and
the associated pitch contours in Figures 11.1-3.

Across languages, it is common to find a strong correlation between focal stress
and focus. For instance, in KK, while the pitch contours for (2a) are relatively uniform
(see Figure 11.1, in (2b) and (2c), there is a peak on the element in focus, „(the city of)
Lima‟ in (2b/ Figure 11.2), and „all (kinds of things)‟ in (2c/Figure 11.3). This
observation can be generalized for any element in focus, whether they are arguments,
predicates, or adverbials: if an element is in focus, it generally coincides with the
prosodic peak within the clause.
However, high pitch does not necessarily coincide with narrow focus — we will
see that the focus domain could be elsewhere within the clause. These correlations are
further explored in §11.2 when discussing the interactions among =pura, constituent
order, and stress to express broad focus.
11.2. Focus constructions that involve =pura
This section examines the functional nuances of =pura, a focus marker. This
morpheme is best analyzed as a clitic because it exhibits very few restrictions with
respect to its phonological host, and lacks a fixed position in the sentence. The marked
element may be a noun phrase (NP) in subject, object, or oblique functions, a verb, a679dependent clause, a particle, and, most interestingly, =pura can focalize individual
elements within more complex syntactic units, such as an argument of a dependent
clause. In terms of pragmatics, =pura can potentially participate in various subtypes of
narrow-focus constructions, but also in broad-focus constructions. To fully account for
the function of =pura we need to include prosody and constituent order in the
discussion, as the interaction among these is relevant for expressing focus in KK. That
is, =pura cannot be associated by itself with specific subtypes of focus because it is the
larger constructions involving =pura that have either a narrow/broad or contrastive/noncontrastive interpretation. Overall, this paper shows that although the appearance of
=pura is pragmatically motivated, its distribution can be grammatically described.
Section 11.2.1 introduces the problem, and the data for this particular study.
Section 11.2.2 presents an overview of the multiple focus constructions in which =pura
is involved, section 11.2.3 discusses narrow-focus constructions, section 11.2.4
examines broad-focus constructions, and section 11.2.5 draws the conclusions of this
study.
11.2.1. The problem and the data
The clitic =pura2 combines with a wide range of stems and lacks a fixed position in
the sentence. In previous studies of KK, the morpheme =pura is barely mentioned. It
has only been reported as either “the emphatic particle which attaches to nominalized
sentences to indicate something that is definitely completed or has already happened”
2The etymology of =pura is uncertain. Two hypotheses can be entertained: the verb purara „find‟ and the
Spanish adjective puro/a „authentic, unadulterated‟. Both need further examination, which is beyond the
scope of this paper.","[705, 706, 707, 708, 709]"

cornNote also in (66) that core arguments of a clause are immediately contiguous to
the verb. While the S or A argument precedes the verb ((66a, b), the O argument
immediately follows the verb (66c). In contrast, oblique phrases appear in the periphery
of the clause and interceding material can occur between them. I have already shown
this fact in (64), by placing the adverb ikun „now‟ in several positions, except between
A-V and V-O. In (67) I give an additional example, placing ikikume „frequently „in
several positions. Note in (67c) that the ADV can be placed between O and LOC
without a problem. However, the speaker does not like it between A and V (67d), and it
definitely does not work between V and O (67e).

Neither S, nor A, nor O receives morphological case marking. In contrast, oblique
518phrases are morphologically marked with postpositions. As described in Chapter VI,
KK has a set of postpositions to express spatial (direction to, direction from, static
location, etc.) and non-spatial information (comitative, instrument, purpose,
comparison, etc.).
Perhaps the key defining feature of core arguments in KK is their obligatoriness:
they must be expressed within simple clauses, whereas oblique phrases are optional. To
determine whether an argument is obligatory or not, I follow Croft‟s (2001) notion of
instantiation. Croft proposes instantiation to describe both the dimensions of
obligatoriness (i.e., requirement for a participant to be syntactically expressed) and
latency (i.e., requirement for a definite interpretation of a participant if it is left
syntactically unexpressed). The idea is that when an element is absent from a
construction (Null Instantiation), it does not always entail that no referent exists for it.8
Applying these notions to KK, there is a clear distinction between core
arguments (subject and object) and obliques. While subjects and objects need to be
overtly instantiated by either full NPs or pronominal forms in order to have well-formed
sentences, the latter appear whenever they are semantically appropriate. In other words,
in main clauses, subjects and objects are neither obligatorily nor optionally ellipsed. The
8Following Fillmore and Kay (1993), Croft‟s framework includes four types of null instantiation: Free
Null Instantiation-FNI (i.e., the referent can be freely identified by the hearer); Indefinite Null
Instantiation-INI (i.e., the referent is indeterminate but the verb or construction imposes constraints on the
semantic nature of the participant); Definite Null Instantiation-DNI (i.e., the referent must be accessible,
it specifies a particular interpretation —e.g. pro-drop or null anaphora); Non-Null Instantiation-NNI (i.e.,
access to the referent is provided by an overt expression). The examples below are adapted from Croft
(2001:276-277):
a. She wrote a letter Ø
 FNI (on blue stationery, on a napkin…)
b. The dog just ate Ø
 INI (whatever, but must be food)
c. The Germans lost Ø
 DNI (the game; accessible referent)
d. She lifted the child
 NNI (*She lifted Ø)519following passage from a traditional story about a woman attacked by the devil
illustrates this (subjects and objects are in bold, semicolons indicate pauses).

As for complex clauses, equi-subjects of complement clauses are ellipsed;
however, equi-subjects of adverbial clauses are not. KK has also some constructions
with obligatory ellipsis, such as adverbial clauses of purpose. In those constructions,
both subject (A/S) and object (O) control the coreference. For a detailed
characterization of complex clauses, see Chapter X.
In contrast, no oblique phrase is obligatory, or controls the coreference of
another element within the clause. Or in Croft‟s terms, obliques in KK do not specify
particular interpretations; that is, they are almost always free null instantiated. Below is
a summary of the differences between subject, object and obliques discussed in this
section.

In Vallejos (2010), I have demonstrated that the language shows no evidence for
a construction that profiles three participants, that is, for a syntactic ditransitive
construction with two non-subject arguments. In what follows I summarize the major
conclusions of that study.
KK shows both indirective (P=T≠R) and secundative (P=R≠T) alignment types
(Dryer 1986, Haspelmath 2004), but no formal or behavioral evidence for a second
object of any kind. In KK, typical three-participant events are syntactically encoded in
at least three ways, none of which contains two grammatical objects of any sort.
Consider the following examples:

1SG.M=DATExamples (69-71) show that events that at the semantic level involve three
semantic participants are encoded in three ways.9 In (69a), agent and theme are encoded
as subject and object, respectively, whereas the recipient is expressed as dative.10 In
(70a) the recipient or goal is expressed as locative. In (71a), agent and recipient are
subject and object, whereas the theme is expressed as instrument. Further, the (b)
counterparts of examples (69-71) demonstrate that DAT, LOC, and INS are optional
within a clause.Table 9.6 shows typical three-participant events organized according to
the pattern with which they combine. Note that the so-called derived ditransitives such
as causatives display the third pattern.

"Introduction to Morphology
CHAPTER IV
INTRODUCTION TO MORPHOLOGY
This chapter provides an overview of the morphological units and processesavailable in KK. It provides the necessary operational definitions and background for
the discussion presented in the upcoming chapters. The grammatical categories
expressed through the mechanisms outlined in this chapter are treated in more detail in
subsequent chapters.
From a typological perspective, KK can be characterized as an isolating language
because words tend to be comprised of one morpheme, and morphemes can be
identified with particular meanings. As such, bare nominals and nominal modifiers are
common. Because of reanalysis and grammaticalization processes, there are also a few
instances were morpheme boundaries are not clear. On the other hand, considering that
KK uses order of constituents, specific grammatical words, and particles, rather than
inflection to express syntactic relations within sentences, it can also be characterized as
analytical.",[172]

"SVOS V…c. panara pɨtani-n

banana ripen-NZR find there
„Ripened banana he finds there‟raepeOSVAs indicated earlier, the findings presented in Table 11.7 reveal that
progressive-marked constructions (VS & SOV) are the least productive of all (3% in the
database). It needs to be pointed out that the results of the frequency study are
categorical with respect to non-progressive constructions; however, these numbers tell
nothing about the productivity of tense-marked clauses alone. Recall that nonprogressive constructions include both tense-marked clauses and clauses that are
unmarked for tense and aspect. Thus, considering that progressive marked are
extremely rare in discourse, I wondered how productive tense-marked constructions
actually are, compared to progressive-marked clauses and clauses that are unmarked for
tense and aspect. This question is addressed in the last section of this chapter, §11.5.
11.4.3. Conclusions of this section
First, the language has several constituent order patterns; however, their
distribution in natural discourse is extremely skewed. The unmarked focus structure
typically displays the SV(O) order. In this configuration, the S argument is highly
topical, hence generally expressed by pronouns. Constituent order plays a significant
role in expressing pragmatic factors: sentence initial position is the privileged position.",[765]
"727Short forms also occur with postpositions such as ablative, dative, comitative,
etc. This is consistent with what we know about syntactic distribution and information
management in discourse (Du Bois 1987) (see also §11.4): new and/or salient
information is usually introduced into the discourse as a core argument of a clause,
generally as either S or O. In KK, obliques add complementary information in a given
clause, as opposed to core arguments that bring central information. Here is the
example:
(51) yayti tsa
also 1SG.Futsu na=muki [ tsa
go 2SG=COM 1SG.Fyumayari-tsen ene],
help-PUR3
2SG.Lna ya
kumitsa
QT 3SG.F say
„”I also go with you to help you,” like this she talks‟
In (51), besides the short form na attached by the comitative, notice also the
short form tsa within the subordinate clause of purpose, and the short form ya in the
quotative expression. As for ya „she,‟ in KK, short forms are also common in formulaic
expressions such as quotatives. This is shown in (47) and (51), in which a short form
pronoun follows the quoative na. The appearance of the long form ene was explained
earlier, as a case that is grammatically predicted.
11.3.5. Conclusions
An examination of discourse data reveals that two explanatory parameters
predict the distribution of pronominal forms: in some constructions, only certain
pronouns are allowed, and in constructions where any pronominal form is grammatical,728pragmatic information status of the referent correlates with choice of pronominal form
in actual use.
As examples of pronominal forms predicted by grammar, short free forms and
clitics function as possessors and objects of postpositions, whereas long forms do not. If
both core arguments are coded as preverbal free pronouns (i.e., SOV or OSV), and one
is in the long form and the other in the short form, the long form must be interpreted as
S and the short form as O, even if that would produce an otherwise unacceptable order.
Also in constructions with descriptive words, the subject will be in the long form.
In the templates SV and SVO, which are by far the most frequent patterns (see
§11.4), any of the three sets of forms can occur in both the S and O syntactic slots. It is
in these grammatically unrestricted contexts that pragmatic information status plays its
role, with selection of type of pronoun an iconically motivated phenomenon: long
forms, short forms, and clitics carry different amounts of information. Long forms carry
more information than short forms and clitics, being used for encoding the most salient
referents within the universe of the discourse; they are used for expressing participants
that are in one of multiple types of focus. Short form pronouns occur by default,
typically referring to recurring participants in core grammatical relations. Clitics are the
further reductions of short forms; they, are the result of morphophonological rules
applied to short forms. Note that in order to have well-formed clauses, arguments are
generally required to occur explicitly; short forms and clitics are used to fulfill this
requirement for established participants.","[756, 757, 758]"
"681Generally, =pura occurs appended to the last word of a constituent or phrase
(e.g., 3a-d). On nouns, however, =pura exhibits an odd distribution because it occupies
a slot position close to the root. That is, it shows up between derivational morphemes
and the evaluative morphemes, as shown in the following examples:
(4) tsuwɨ=pura
yawati=pura=tua=nu
panara-pan=pura=kanablood=FOC
„the blood‟
turtle=FOC=AUG=PL.F „the huge turtles‟
banana-DER=FOC=PL.M „the banana farms‟The distribution of =pura in natural discourse raises questions regarding its
function. If =pura is a focus marker, what type(s) of focus does it express? That is, how
does the function of =pura fit in the typology of focus? Does =pura encode focus
independently from other widely attested mechanisms, such as stress and constituent
order, or does it interact with such mechanisms to produce formal distinctions resulting
in various subtypes of focus? The remainder of this section addresses these questions.
The database for this study is a portion of the texts described earlier (§2.9). The
texts altogether consist of about 2539 intonation units, among which 351 instances of
the focus morpheme =pura have been identified. Thus, this morpheme occurs in about
14% of all intonation units.
11.2.2. The scope and function of =pura: an overview
In order to understand the function of =pura in discourse, one has to understand
how this morpheme behaves in the internal structure of sentences themselves. From a
morphosyntactic point of view, =pura can be associated with specific particles, NPs,
verbs and sentences. In this section I argue that the focus domain and the focus subtype
are marked by a combination of =pura, constituent order and stress.","[710, 711]"
"736Thus, the pattern OSV is the result of focalizing O when it encodes pragmatically
salient information. These results are consistent with what has been found in other areas
of the grammar, such as focus constructions.
Another finding of the frequency study is that the progressive-marked patterns
— VS and SOV — are extremely rare in spontaneous speech. In the next section we
turn the discussion to those patterns, and explore the function of progressive-marked
constructions by contrasting them with tense-marked constructions.
11.5. The function of tense/aspect marked clauses in discourse
In several places in this dissertation, I have stated that there is a relationship
between tense, aspect, and constituent order (see§11.4.1). In section, §11.4, the
productivity of the various ordering patterns available in the language was examined.
One of the findings is that progressive-marked patterns appear very rarely (about 3% of
declarative sentences). However, because tense-marked clauses pattern like unmarked
clauses, those results tell nothing about the productivity of tense-marked clauses.
So, two questions arise: i) How often do speakers employ tense-marked clauses,
progressive-marked clauses, and unmarked clauses? ii) What drives the distribution of
tense-marked clauses and progressive-marked clauses? This section addresses those
questions by exploring whether or not all, of any of those patterns can be associated
with particular discourse functions.
11.5.1. Background and foreground in discourse
A crucial finding regarding the structure of the discourse is that languages codify in
different ways the main events of a story, i.e., foreground information, as opposed to737supportive material, i.e., background information (Hopper 1979). Empirical studies
have shown that this observation is especially relevant for the study of narratives; that
is, those types of discourses that are basically monologues. Some of the defining
features of these two types of information are summarized in Table 11.8.
Table 11.8: Background vs. foreground (Hopper 1979, Longacre 1996)
ForegroundBackground refers to dynamic and active events,
punctual verbs often in perfective aspect
 high level of assertion durative, stative, iterative verbs, often in
imperfective aspect
 low level of assertion (modals) events happen in sequences, contingent on
the completion of prior events does not happen in sequences, may be
located at any point along the time axis, or
not located at all
 add supportive material, complementary
information, comment on main events constitutes the main storyline
 new material in the storyline is introduced
in the predicate (verb plus complement) likelihood of topic changes, introduction of
new information in the subject positionHopper suggests that the foreground/background distinction is a universal of
narrative discourse (1979:213), and it is encoded by means of several strategies. A
number of studies seem to confirm this hypothesis. For instance, some of the attested
strategies are voice (Malay), word order (old English), and tense/aspect (Swahili,
French), among others.
Although the foreground/background distinction is valid in at least narrative, it
is perhaps somehow too general. For instance, some studies have found that within the
foreground category, languages may make a distinction between unexpected/crucial
events and routine/predictable events; others distinguish the events that constitute the
climax from the ones that do not. In Yagua, for instance, there are two types of
foreground: ordinary main event line versus peak (Payne 1992). In Godie there are three738types of foreground information: crucial events, sequential events, and concluded events
(Marchese 1988). That is, languages have multiple ways of organizing even the
foreground half of discourse.
Further, even though the relevance of the foreground/background distinction in
narratives seems undeniable, it is not clear that this distinction is applicable to other
types of discourse, especially those that involve more than one speaker, such as
spontaneous conversations. As Longacre (1996) points out, before this type of analysis
is extended to other types of discourse it is perhaps necessary to set up some parameters
to classify them into different genres; this may make it possible to have comparable
results.17
In §11.5.2, we evaluate the significance of the foreground/background distinction
to explain the distribution of progressive-marked clauses and tense-marked clauses in
KK discourse.
11.5.2. Data and findings
This particular discourse study examines twenty-one short texts (2546
intonational units in total), collected from eleven speakers. The variables considered in
the selection of the sample were the following:
Gender of the speaker: This variable is relevant for KK since the language
displays several distinctions according to the speaker‟s gender. The texts come
from four women and five men.","[765, 766, 767, 768]"

plural, in both female and male speech. The inclusive form, ini, is identical in both
speech varietes, so is second person singular and plural.
For third person singular there is an additional opposition regarding the syntactic
function of the pronoun. The forms display an accusative pattern, as summarized in
Table 5.2. Note that while clitics in S/A argument function are proclitics, these in O
argument function are enclitics. In addition, the nominative set can take the plural
marker —i.e., uri=kana/ ra=kana, ay=nu/ inu „they‟— although this phenomenon
seems associated with specific idiolects. Beyond third person pronouns, no morphemes
corresponding to specific syntactic functions have been found for other persons.

=uraThe distribution of the three sets of pronominal forms is only partially predicted
by grammar. For instance, at the clause level, the three sets of forms (Table 5.1) have201quite similar behavior in terms of the syntactic functions they can assume. In general,
they can function as the S, A, or O argument if the construction displays unmarked
word order. Yet there are certain constructions where distinct distributions of short
forms, long forms and clitics has been found. Furthermore, their distributional pattern in
natural discourse is driven by pragmatic factors.
From all the pronouns in Table 5.1, Rodrigues (1984/1985: 43) states that only
five forms are of Tupí-Guaraní (TG) or Tupinamba origin. These are listed in (25).

5.3.1. Long form pronouns
Long form pronouns can assume subject (S/A) and object functions, as
presented in (26). In (26a), the first person pronoun etse is the S argument; in (26b) it is
the A argument; and in (26c) it is the O argument.

1SG.FLong forms generally show up as unbounded free-word forms. However, in fast
speech, long forms in object function can appear phonologically attached to the202immediately preceding element (27a-c). Recall from §3.4, that when one element
cliticizes to another, the vowel of the preceding element disappears. Thus, in (27a-b)
that, etse „first person female speech long form‟ attaches to the verbal word, the vowel
of the causative -ta is deleted. Similarly, in (27c) the final vowel of the verb piyata „ask
for‟ is lost when the pronoun ene is attached.

allowed; at the same time, there are constructions in which long forms are not allowed.
Long forms are required in sentences with second position clitics. That is to say,
if a sentence includes a modal clitic and the first element is a pronoun, it has to be from
the long form set (28a-c). Modal clitics appended to short form pronouns yield
unacceptable sentences (28d).

In constructions with stative verbs that refer to human propensity concepts, a
long form is required to express some kind of metaphorical locative-possessive
relationship. The construction is: [V NP]. The verb refers to the possessed attribute that
could be thought of as being located on someone. The noun phrase is the location and/or
the possessor. If a pronoun occurs in the NP slot, it has to be the long form. In examples
(29a-b) the long form pronouns follow the words expressing metaphorically located
concepts, such as „goodness‟ and „fear‟. Note, however, that when the descriptive word
occurs in a different type of construction (29c), where the pronominal precedes the
descriptive word, a clitic pronoun is fine (29c).

„Why are you scared?‟
In clause constructions marked by progressive aspect, the order SOV is one ofthe available configurations (§9.1.1). In this template, if the subject is a pronoun, it has
to be from the long form set. If a short form occurs, the sequence [pronoun noun] will
have a genitive interpretation where the short form is taken as the possessor, as shown
in (30b). Note that example (30b) is unacceptable not because of the form of the204pronoun itself but because short form must be interpreted as the possessor of the second
N; as a result, the object of burning is missing in the sentence.2

"Non-contrastive narrow focus constructionsFocus constructions in which the pura-marked NP remains in its usual position —
focusing in situ — do not have contrastive interpretations. In other words, focusing in
situ occurs when the clitic =pura attaches to either the object or the subject in the
pragmatically unmarked order pattern SV(O).
11.2.3.1.1. Marking core arguments in the main clause
In the examples below, the NPs marked by =pura are the O arguments. In
example (5), repeated from (2b), the scope of =pura is „Lima (city)‟, and in (6),
repeated from (2c), „all (kinds of things).‟ In terms of encoding, notice two things: both
examples display pragmatically unmarked constituent order, and the beginning of the
focused constituent coincides with the prosodic peak. The construction is [S V O=pura].
(5)S V
ɨ wati=tsui ts=umi [lima

rana yumi [upi mari=pura]
it‟s.true
3PL.M give all thing=FOC
„For real, they give us all kinds of things‟684tana=tsui
1PL.M=ABLWhen we turn to the communicative context in which the examples above are
used, the speaker typically signals his concern with a particular instantiation of a
variable that is not evident by itself. In (5), reporting about her first trip by airplane, the
speaker asserts that while still in the air, she could see Lima; that is, suddenly Lima
appeared. In example (6) the speaker is talking about the fact that when a catastrophe
occurred in his community, they asked the authorities for help and they did in fact
receive „all kinds of things‟. Thus, the examples in (5) and (6) evoke presuppositions
with an open variable. The variables are saturated in the following way:
(5‟) Presupposition: <I see X>; assertion: <X= Lima city>
(6‟) Presupposition: <they give X to us>; assertion: <X= all kinds of things>
In spontaneous conversations, instantiation of a variable can also come from the
interlocutor. Some of the interlocutor‟s interventions could be understood as a
communication that he “got the point”; that is, the interlocutor confirms that the
variable has been correctly instantiated. The passage below comes from a conversation
in which speaker A is saying that she learned from her grandmother and other relatives
the stories that she knows. Speaker B‟s intervention is in (7b):
(7) a. Speaker A: tsa=nai
ɨmɨntsara-yara ukua=tsuri

„(Also) my grandmother used to tell stories‟

ah
2SG=listen old-NZR=FOC=PL.M
„Ah, you listen to the elders‟Presupposition: <you listen to X>; assertion: <X = the elders>685In narratives, another prominent use of =pura is when the speaker “repeats” a
piece of information to ensure that the hearer is fully aware of the proposition and does
not doubt it any further. In (8), the speaker is talking about her experience with a nonhuman creature. In (8a) she mentions that it touches „her foot‟. In (8b), she repeats
„foot‟ and marks it with =pura, in case the hearer did not “get the point” that is essential
for understanding the subsequent part of the narrative. Notice that only in (8b) is the O
argument marked by =pura.

includes two complement clauses, indicated by square brackets. The main verb is tsenu
„hear, whose object is „his mom says that she already saw it‟, a complement clause that
contains within itself another complement clause, as the object of kumitsa „say‟ is „she

To this point, I have shown that the complement clause appears in the object‟scanonical position, following the verb. If the object needs to be highlighted, we would
expect the entire complement clause to be fronted. However, the fronted sentential
object no longer has the structure of a complement clause, but of a relative clause (17)
(for more details, see 10.3).

10.2.3 . Direct-quotes
Quotes are a very salient feature of KK discourse. In spontaneous speech,
several PCU and manipulation verbs occur with direct and indirect quotes. It should be
pointed out, though, that indirect quotes, in general, are rather rare compared to direct
quotes. Some PCU and manipulation verbs that often take direct-quotes include:
kumitsa „say‟, piyata „ask‟, wanakari „order‟, and paritsari „invite.‟ Direct quotes either579precede or follow the above verbs, but in no instance is there syntactic evidence that the
quote is a syntactic dependent of the PCU/manipulation verb. The remainder of this
section will support that claim with multiple examples.
Examples in (18) and (19) include the typical manipulation verb wanakari
„order‟. In (18a), the direct quote “go cook it” comes after the verb wanakari „order‟and
one might be tempted to argue that it functions as the direct object. However, in
elicitation, the tense clitic can mark wanakari rather than following the quote, as it
would were the quote an object. Second, a direct object NP — like „him‟ — can be
added in (18b). (18b) includes an indirect quote. Here the object is explicitly stated by
the pronominal, and the quote is within an adverbial clause of purpose, which does not
fulfill a semantic or grammatical role of the finite verb „order‟ (for more discussion of
-tsen adverbial clauses see §10.4.1.3).

As mentioned earlier, the majority of quotes precede the PCU/manipulation
verbs. This is also the case with wanakiri „order‟ (19). In those cases, the quote appears
in its own intonation unit; a falling intonation contour plus a pause is indicated by the
semicolon. Syntactically, this looks identical to a sequence of finite clauses.","[606, 607, 608, 609]"
"749to verbs) but none of them obligatorily occurs in any particular syntactic context.
Second, most grammatical categories that, across-languages, are encoded as inflectional
morphology (e.g., number, tense, and mood (Bybee 1985:30-31)) in KK are conveyed
by means of categorically unrestricted cltics and syntactic strategies ike auxiliaries. Five
tense clitics encode three degrees of distance in the past and two in the future, although
one of the future markers (-a) is becoming obsolete. There are also six epistemic modal
clitics: four second position clitics that convey speaker-oriented modality and two verb
phrase clitics that encode event-oriented modality. These two sets interact to create a
four-way modal system.
The language has twelve suffixes, the majority of which could be located
towards the derivational end of the continuum. None of the twelve suffixes is
obligatory, but in texts, it is common to find verbs with as many as four suffixes and
two clitics.
There are three major non-verbal predicate constructions (juxtaposition of noun
phrases, existential constructions, and adverbial predicates) for expressing functions
such as proper inclusion, equation, attribution, location, existence, and possession. It is
worth pointing out that that the language has no special construction dedicated to
indicating possession; rather, possession is inferred in several constructions, mainly
varieties of the existential.
KK has intransitive and transitive clauses, but semantically three-place
predicates are syntactically encoded by means of transitive clauses. Formal evidence
shows that clauses with three syntactic arguments do not exist in KK. In clauses750containing semantically three-place predicates, every test applied shows that only two
of them are syntactically coded as core arguments in a single clause. In addition, there
are two morphemes whose basic functions are to increase the valence of verbs: the
causative -ta and the applicative -tsupe. While both morphemes entail the introduction
of new participants into the scene, from a syntactic point of view the derived patterns
never contain more than two syntactic arguments. Thus, KK confirms the prediction
that derived valence patterns do not add arguments beyond the maximum number
allowed by non-derived valence patterns (Haspelmath & Muller-Bradey 2004).
There are seven directive constructions that distinguish degrees of pragmatic
force. They range from basic second-person imperatives (Do it!), rogatives (Please do
it!), exhortatives (Go do it!), jussives (Let‟s do it), and polite requests (Come in, do it!),
prohibitives (Don‟t do it!), and postponed prohibitives (You/someone won‟t do it!).
From a functional perspective, the directive constructions primarily try to get others to
do things, differing mainly with respect to the level of control over the outcome,
imperative and prohibitive conveying the strongest obligation on the part of the
addressee.
In KK, adverbial clauses show different degrees of clause integration with the
main clause. By definition, adverbial clauses are not expected to share arguments with
the matrix clause. However, the language has three purpose clauses which differ in
terms of coreference: two of them obligatorily have an argument that is coreferential
with the absolutive argument of the main clause, the third obligatorily has no
coreferential arguments. Specifically, -tara indicates that the missing argument in the751subordinate clause is the S/A; -mira indicates that the missing argument in the
dependent clause is the O, and -tsen has no missing arguments. Thus, although the
controller of the coreference in adverbial clauses is the absolutive, the target of that
control is nominative or accusative. As a result, the choice between -tara and -mira is
predicted by grammar, while the choice between -mira/-tara and -tsen is pragmatically
driven.
Clause nominalization is a central subordination strategy, particularly in
relativization, which is largely achieved via an absolutive nominalizer. The arguments S
and O are relativized by suffixing -n to the subordinate verb; the A argument is
relativized by suffixing -tara to the subordinate verb. Dative phrases (recipients and
benefactives) pattern with locatives in terms of relativization; they are relativized by
gapping and the relativizer -tupa. The positions that access to relativization are O
(theme, causee, recipient and applicative objects), S (active, stative), A (transitive), and
OBL (location, dative).
Pragmatically, KK has constructions that explicitly distinguish subtypes of focus
according to scope (narrow/broad) and pragmatic information (contrastive/noncontrastive). This bears on theories about whether contrast simply emerges from
conversational implicature versus whether it is explicitly coded by dedicated grammar.
Information structure also explains the distribution of alternating pronominal forms
(long forms, short forms, and clitics) and several constituent orders. A frequency study
found that the SV(O) order is the pragmatically unmarked pattern in the language,
appearing in about 94% of declarative sentences. In addition, it was demonstrated that752salient information is placed in first position in the sentence; thus, the OSV pattern is
the result of focalizing the O argument. Background and foreground information is
relevant to explain the use of tense-marked clauses, progressive-marked clauses, and
unmarked clauses (for tense and aspect). First, progressive-marked clauses signal
descriptive, often evaluative information that breaks the temporal sequence of main
events. Second, the mainline or foreground information is mostly signaled by unmarked
clauses. The temporal frame is established at the beginning of the discourse by means of
adverbs and/or tense-marked clauses. Third, tense-marked clauses tend to occur at key
moments of the plot to reaffirm the temporal frame, to resume the plot, and to
manipulate the temporal-deictic point.
A final point that needs to be made is with respect to the genetic classification of
KK. Though long classified as Tupí-Guaraní (TG), Cabral (1995, 2007) claims that KK
is the product of a contact language situation and hence has a mixed grammar. Based on
the patterns presented in this dissertation, this claim is basically accurate, although open
questions remain regarding the mechanism of disruption and convergence, as well as
which languages contributed to the mix.
As for the Tupian origin of the KK people, there is a consensus among
anthropologists and historians alike that the KK and Omaguas living in Peru are
descendents of the Tupí ethnic group. As been pointed out by Lathtrap 1970, Chaumeil
1981, and Rivas 2000, among many others, the early chonicles clearly report the
migration of Tupí groups from Eastern Brazil towards the Western Amazon centuries
prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers. That is, prior Tupian presence in the region is753out of the question. However, the fact that the main vocabulary of KK is of Tupí origin
clearly shows that a Tupían language was crucially involved in the genesis of the
language.
Cabral puts forward a series of hypotheses with respect to the genesis of the
grammar of Kokama. She claims that Kokama, and its sister language Omagua, arose in
a short period of time in the missionary villages in the province of Maynas (Peru) by the
end of the 17th century (1995:307). According to Cabral, Kokama and Omagua were
promoted as lingua francas by the missionaries, and thus became the language of
evangelization to indigenous peoples of several ethnic backgrounds. Further, she argues
that Kokama and Omagua grammar are the result of imperfect adult learning of a
formerly more complex Tupí-Guaraní pattern, and she thus categorizes them as abrupt
creoles. Abrupt creoles do not require crystallized pidgins and entail significant
disruption in the transmission of grammatical patterns (Thomason and Kaufman 1988,
Muysken 2008).
The crucial evidence for imperfect learning is the simplification of the Pro-Tupí
Guaraní (PTG) cross-reference system (i.e., four sets of person markers) and the
fossilization of PTG instances of prefixes and suffixes. Interestingly, though, a number
of TG languages have simplified the cross-reference system in various ways (Jensen
1997), from maximal (cf. Tocantis Asurini, Tapiparé) to minimal (cf. Wayampi) to nonexistent (cf. Urubu-Kaapor). As for the fossilization of TG morphology, a look at the
forms provided by Cabral (1995:64-73) reveals that the retained forms are far from
random; on the contrary, on nouns the vast majority of frozen elements are the754relational prefix *i- (about 98%), and the nominal case suffix -a (about 96%). As for
verbs, the majority has retained the third person singular *o- (about 72%) or the first
person plural inclusive *ja (18%). Similar phenomena are not strange in the literature
on grammaticalization.
From the features typically associated with creoles (Hancock 1986, Arends et al.
1995), KK exhibits grammaticalization of content words (e.g., auxiliaries,
interrogatives, etc.), vast use of clitics to convey tense and modality, and minimal
presence of affixes. Yet at the same time, creole features not found in KK include verb
serialization, plural derived from a third person pronoun, complex reflexives, a
generalized locative, negation with a simple preverbal particle and collapse of aspects.
In fact, KK has five postpositions that indicate different types of location and direction,
several ways of indicating various aspectual nuances, six degrees of speaker-oriented
modality, two mechanisms of negation, etc. Overall, KK has a far more elaborated
grammar than typical creoles; thus, categorizing KK solely in structural grounds —i.e.,
in comparison with prototypical creoles— is problematic.
However, the crucial point that needs to be explained is the fact that KK —or at
least the variety described in this study— has retained an important number of PTG
elements (see Table 12.1, based on Jensen 1998, Cabral 1995, Rodrigues 1984/1985, as
well as new observations highlighted throughout this dissertation). What this suggests is
that the disruption of grammatical patterns, although significant, was not as dramatic as
in typical abrupt creoles (i.e., Afrikaans, Caribean creoles).","[778, 779, 780, 781, 782, 783, 784]"
"66711. Topics on the discourse-syntax interfaceCHAPTER XI
TOPICS IN THE SYNTAX-DISCOURSE INTERFACE
This chapter is dedicated to topics in Information Structure and focuses on four
morphosyntactic mechanisms to express some discourse-pragmatic factors: pronominal
forms, tense/aspect marked clauses, constituent ordering, and focus constructions.1
After a brief introduction to the core notions of information structure in §11.1, §11.2
looks at the distribution of focus constructions that involve the particle =pura. Along
the same lines, §11.3 examines the driving forces behind the distribution of the three
sets of pronouns. §11.4 goes on to explore the pragmatics of the various constituent
orders attested in the language, and §11.5 explores the interactions among tense,
progressive aspect, and constituent order, focusing on the pragmatic conditions
triggering the employment of these patterns in combination. The theoretical
assumptions relevant to specific topics are introduced within the respective subsections.
1A considerable amount of the data and analysis presented in this chapter come from talks given at the
Workshop on Indigenous Languages of the Americas, University of California at Santa Barbara (Vallejos
2005), the Conference on Indigenous Language of Latin America III, University of Texas at Austin
(Vallejos 2007), and from a published article (Vallejos 2009).","[696, 697]"
"611Consider these examples from texts, which perhaps demonstrate this
phenomenon more clearly:
(67)a. ya
purara
yuwama=chasu=utsu

arawata
3SG.M=carry
this=PAS3
3SG.M=catch-NZR sp.monkey
„He carried this, the monkey [that he had shot]‟
In (67a) the relative clause consists of the verb kamata „work‟ which is markedby the progressive -ri and the nominalizer -n. However, the andative auxiliary utsu
appears after „daughter in law‟, not after „working‟ as expected if the nominalized
structure kamatarin would be part of the NP object. As a result, the relative clause is
interpreted not as modifying „daughter in law‟, the object of the verb „find‟, but rather
as adverbial information about the subject, „when she is working‟. The consultant
explains that if the auxiliary were to show up after kamatarin, then the translation
would be: „the poor daughter that is working‟. It is worth pointing out that this temporal
interpretation becomes available only if the subordinate verb is marked by the
progressive. In (108b) we have a parallel situation. Here the tense marker =tsuri sets the
boundary of the object.
As described in Chapter V, plural and focus markers belong to the set of noun
phrase clitics. Considering that the head noun together with the RC constitutes a noun
phrase, we expect plural and focus to show up at the right edge of the construction,
whether this is RC-N or N-RC. In (68) notice that the RC „that fell down‟ follows its
head, „house‟; accordingly, the focus marker attaches after the nominalized verb. In612addition, the plural marker =kana occurs at the end of the complex NP, but it is clear
that its scope includes „house‟.

The focus markers and the plural markers can occur twice within complex nounphrases. That is, they can attach to both the head noun and the RC. Unfortunately, in the
database, this only occurs in postnominal RCs (69a-c); at this time, I cannot determine
whether or not this is possible in prenominal RCs.

„We will reach again the people [who are crossing (the street)]‟
In addition to the fact that the heads and the RCs in (69) are independently
marked by focus and plural, evidence from prosody and information structure suggest
that in constructions like (69a-c), the head and the RC are each behaving as independent
syntactic units (Vallejos 2009, see also Chapter XI). At the same time, they function613together as either the subject or object of the clause. Thus, a better interpretation of
these examples is that they consist of two NPs in an appositive relationship. These
appositive NPs have the same referent, which in the communicative context happens to
be in focus.
The final element listed in Table 10.2 is temporal adverbs. In (70a) I show that it
is possible to place an adverb between N-RC. Although speakers find an adverbial
between RC-N to be understandable, it is considered odd (70b). That is, when the RC
precedes its head, adverbs must precede the RC (70c).

„The dog [that yesterday escaped] bit my son‟(ED)
The distribution of adverbs in (70a-c) seems to suggest that RC-N is asyntactically tighter unit than N-RC. However, it is also possible to argue that these
restrictions in the placement of adverbs are due to the verbal-final character of the
embedded clause. In simple declarative sentences, adverbials show up either at the
beginning or the end of the clause. Thus, if the clause ends in a verb, there is no
problem for an adverbial to occur after the verb. Therefore, the problem of having an
adverb between the RC and the N need not have to do with the tightness of the bond614between the RC and the N, but rather with the requirement for the verb to be the final
element in subordinate clauses.
Overall, it is possible to say that the sequence RC-N is syntactically less tight
than the sequence N-RC. Tense clitics and auxiliaries can occur between RC and N, but
they cannot occur between N and RC. Plural and focus markers must occur once, at the
end of the complex NP in order for it to be interpreted as a unit. If plural and/or focus
occur on the noun in the order N-RC, the sequence is interpreted as appositive NPs,
similar to what happens with tense. Since the database does not contain any examples of
prenominal RCs with focus and plural in both the head and the RC, this question must
be further explored in the future.
10.4 . Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses, by definition, do not fulfill a core semantic or grammatical
role in a matrix clause. Adverbial clauses modify an associated main clause, and
because of their adjunct status, they can be omitted.
To form adverbial clauses, KK employs a set of adverbial subordinators that
indicate a specific semantic relationship between main and adverbial clause. The set of
clausal subordinators include purposives (-mira, -tara, -tsen), reason (-ikua), cause
(-rikua), temporals (-npu „after‟, -puka „when/while/since‟, -anan „before‟), and the
conditional (-ra/ri). Based on their syntactic distribution, these morphemes can be
organized into two subsets. The first subset, which includes the three purpose markers
and the conditional marker, always attach to the subordinated verb, or to an auxilary, if
one occurs. The second subset, which consists of the cause marker and the temporal615markers, always attaches to the last element in the adverbial clause, whether this is a
verb (in intransitive clauses), a noun (if the clause includes an object), or any other
element.
In KK, adverbial clauses show different degrees of integration with the main
clause. With the exception of purpose clauses, KK adverbial clauses are not embedded
in the same sense as complement clauses and relative clauses. As will be discussed in
§10.4.1, the language has three purpose clauses, two of which obligatorily share an
argument with the main clause; but the co-reference relations are established in a
typologically rare fashion. Table 10.3 summarizes the defining features of adverbial
clauses in KK.

However, specific semantic types of adverbial clauses tend to either precede or follow
the main clause. Conditional and causal/reason clauses are almost always preposed,
while purpose are generally postposed. The distribution of temporal clauses is less
categorical. They are mostly preposed, but a number of instances of postposed temporal
clauses are also attested. In the following sections, each type of adverbial clause is
presented in more detail.
10.4.1 . Purpose clauses
Semantically, purpose clauses provide reasons, accounts, or explanations for the
occurrence of the event described in the matrix clause. As indicated in Table 10.3, three
types of adverbial clause constructions for expressing purpose have been attested in
KK. Each type bears its own morphological marker (-tara, -mira, -tsen) which attaches
to the subordinate verb, and each requires different co-reference conditions between one
argument of the matrix clause and one of the purpose clause. While multiple purpose
constructions are well documented across languages, some languages have different
syntax for purpose clauses to indicate distinctions such as whether or not the adverbial
clause and the main clause share any arguments (e.g., same subject versus different
subject, cf. Thompsom et al 2007) or whether the two events are simultaneous,
consecutive, or temporally distant (e.g., visual versus non-visual as in Tariana, cf.
Aikhenvald 2003:395), among others.
However, purpose constructions in KK do not explicitly indicate temporal
distance between the events, and only indirectly which arguments are shared with the
617main clause. From a typological point of view, KK purpose clause constructions
constitute a rare phenomenon: the main clause absolutive argument (S of an intransitive
clause and O of a transitive clause), controls co-reference with a missing argument in
the purpose clause —i.e., is the “pivot.” The choice of purpose clause marker thus
varies only depending on which argument in the subordinate clause is coreferential with
the matrix clause absolutive: specifically, in purpose clauses marked by -tara, the
obligatorily absent nominative (S/A) argument, whereas in those marked by -mira, the
absolutive (O) is obligatorily absent. In contrast to -mira and -tara, -tsen occurs when
all the arguments of the purpose clause are expressed, either as an NP or a pronoun, and
as such no co-reference is required with any main clause arguments. While the choice
between -tara and -mira is automatically conditioned by the semantics of reference, the
choice between -mira/-tara and -tsen is pragmatically driven. In the following, each
subtype of purpose clause is discussed in detail in its own section.
10.4.1.1 . -tara clauses
Purpose clauses marked by -tara are structurally quite similar to A-relative
clauses (see §10.3.1.3). Both A-relatives and tara-purpose clauses, like (71a), cannot
include the A argument. Importantly, -tara attaches to bare verbs; that is, the verbs do
not receive any other verbal inflectional or derivational morphology, except for the
suffix -ta that generates transitive verbs from nouns (see §7.3.2.1). Also similar to
headed A-relatives, in tara-purpose clauses the verb occurs in final position and the
morpheme -tara attaches to it. Yet they appear in rather different syntactic slots within618the clause: headed A-relatives follow a head noun (71b), whereas tara-purpose clauses
simply appear sentence-finally (71a), outside of the verb phrase.

argument of the main clause. In other words, the Absolutive argument of the main
clause controls the ellipsis of the Nominative argument in the adverbial clause. This is
illustrated with elicited in examples in (72) and (73).

Both examples in (72) have an intransitive main clause, and in both the S of themain clause, „shaman‟ controls referentiality of the missing argument of the adverbial
clause. In (72a), the purpose clause is intransitive, hence co-reference is with the
missing S argument; in (72b), the purpose clause is transitive, and so co-reference is
with the missing A argument.","[640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648]"

farTo close this section, it is possible to say that the most productive devices for
interrogation in KK are the morpheme =tipa and interrogative pronouns. In theory,
every piece of information contained in a sentence can be interrogated by simply
placing it in sentence-initial position and marking it with =tipa. Content questions are
formed by means of interrogative pronouns which must appear fronted; =tipa is optional
in this type of question. KK has a small set of interrogative pronouns; however, on the
basis of this small set many others can be derived by means of postpositions and
546subordinators. Intonation alone and subject-verb inversion are less productive
mechanism for forming questions.
9.5. Directive sentences
Directive sentences are those by which we try to get others to do things (Searle
1980). In other words, the main function of directive clauses is to get or advise the
hearer to do something. In KK, the category of directive sentences subsumes a range of
subtypes, among which are included imperatives, hortatives, jussives, rogatives,
postponed prohibitives, and others, and whose illocutionary force goes from orders and
requests to exhortations, suggestions, wishes, petitions and warnings. Directives have
neither tense nor modality marking, except for rogatives and prohibitives, which can
take the certainty marker -tin to add overtones of irony and sarcasm to rogatives and
emphasis to prohibitives. A list of the attested constructions is presented in Table 9.10.

markers, use of bare stems, etc. (König & Siemund 2007). The main strategies KK
employ is suppression of the subject and directive markers. In the subsequent sections I
present each construction in detail.
9.5.1. Imperatives
The term imperative here is reserved for sentence types directed to the
addressee, that is, those sentences with an understood second person subject. The most
basic imperative construction in KK is formed by suppressing the subject, leaving the
verb and potentially an auxiliary. If the verb is transitive, then an object follows the
verb. Schematically: [V (AUX) (OBJ)]. The prosody of imperative sentences is quite
distinctive. They are generally fast paced and have higher pitch, strong intensity in the
last stressed syllable, and abrupt falling intonation.
In (121) I give imperative sentences with intransitive verbs. Note in (121b) that
the auxiliary uri ‘venitive‟ attaches to the verb. The examples in (122) give imperative
sentences with transitive verbs.
(121) a. utsu

b. ey-uri

c. tsakɨta
ɨwɨra ini
uka ɨwa=ra
cut
tree
1PL.IN house trunk=PUR
„Cut the tree for (to use it as) the post of our house‟
As stated above, the default subject is second person singular. However, in
imperative clauses that include pronouns acting as the possessor of the object, a plural
addressee could be implied. This is shown in (123); note the plural pronoun in (123b).
(123) a. tsukuta
na
chiru
Wash
2SG cloth
„Wash your clothes!‟ (ED)
b. tsukuta
epe chiru
wash
2PL cloth
„Wash your (pl.) clothes‟ (ED)
In terms of the functional load of the imperative construction [V (AUX) (OBJ)],
according to the consultants, the examples in (121)-(123) imply some irritation on the
part of the speaker. For instance, it could be that the speaker expected the addressee to
have performed the tasks indicated in the predicate but he/she did not. Another possible
scenarios would be that the addressee refuses to do something, but by using this
construction the speaker signals that performing the tasks is unavoidable.
In everyday speech, the imperative construction is not the most frequent pattern
among the several directive constructions the language possesses. Compared to the
frequency of exhortatives, jussives, invitations, etc., the imperative is seldom used. In
the database they appear rarely and mainly in direct quotes, as in (124).","[574, 575, 576, 577, 578]"
"709In the pragmatic dimension, the pura-marked NP expresses various subtypes of
focus, generally distinguished via constituent order. When the pura-marked NP is the O
in the SVO pattern, it correlates strongly with non-contrastive focus. When the
pura-marked NP is the O in the OSV pattern, it correlates strongly with contrastive
focus. However, in KK, Dik et al.‟s (1981) finer distinctions within the contrastive
category are neutralized. That is to say that the semantic operations such as selection,
restriction, expansion, etc., are all expressed by the same structure. To express Watters‟
exhaustive listing focus, =pura interacts with the clitic =nan „only‟.
In sentence-focus constructions, the morpheme =pura exhibits a delimitative
function. Here, =pura marks the first element of the focus domain, then focal stress
occurs towards the end of the focused unit. Interestingly, it is possible to posit that in
sentence-focus constructions, the distribution of =pura follows a nominative pattern: in
the formal dimension the subject of either intransitive or transitive clauses are
unstressed NPs and are marked by =pura. In the pragmatic dimension, the subject of the
clause is not the topic and the whole sentence is asserted. In other words, the
nominative pattern plus prosodic peak are central for distinguishing sentence focus from
the range of narrow-focus constructions. Once the hearer knows that i) the subject is
marked by =pura; and ii) it is unstressed, he knows that this is a sentence focus
construction. In contrast, once the hearer knows that i) any non-subject is marked by
=pura; and, ii) it is stressed, this is a narrow-focus construction. A less frequent pattern
(as in 31) shows that stress marks the beginning and =pura the end of the unit under710focus. An additional way of focusing the whole sentence is by attaching =pura to the
negative particle, whose scope is the entire clause.
Overall, the principal results of this study are that the clitic =pura is an important
cue to identify focus constructions — every utterance that includes =pura has a
pragmatically marked focus structure — and that the distribution and function of =pura
in KK discourse is part of a coherent functional system that cannot be understood
without considering multiple interacting factors from morphosyntax, pragmatics, and
prosody.
In §11.2.1, it was mentioned that languages express different types of focus at
the level of sentence grammar. From the two parameters that characterize focus —scope
and pragmatic information— the existence of constructions dedicated to code scope
seems clear. The results of this study support this claim. In KK, the scope of the focused
unit correlates consistently with specific structures. That is, what is clearly coded in KK
is whether a construction has narrow or broad focus structure. When focal stress and
=pura co-occur, it marks a narrow-focus construction; when the subject is marked by
=pura and is unstressed, it marks a sentence-focus construction.
The typological existence of constructions dedicated to pragmatic contrast,
however, has been in dispute. One of the most cited cases of explicit coding of contrast
is that of Aghem. The major conclusions of Watters (1979) are that Aghem has explicit
structures to express specific types of focus, but above all, that Aghem formally
distinguishes contrastive from non-contrastive focus. That is, his findings support the
idea that contrast is a possible grammatical category. However, it is risky to generalize711from his findings as his study is limited to simple-declarative sentences, which were
elicited or construed by the author and tested with one speaker (Watters 1979:141). In
contrast, other studies have found that languages often do not have constructions
devoted to specific types of focus, nor specifically to contrast (Vries 1985). In the same
vein, Lambrecht (1994), after analyzing mostly made-up examples, argues that stress in
English is by no means confined to expressing contrast. He concludes that since a
contrastive interpretation is available but not obligatory, contrast belongs to
conversational implicature rather than to grammar. Lambrecht adds that the problem
seems to be a lack of an operational definition of contrast. Myhill and Xing (1996)
attempt to solve the methodological issue on how to recognize contrast in discourse
data. They operationalize Chafe‟s (1976) definition of contrast —a set of alternatives
for the role being contrasted— and look at discourse in Chinese and Biblical Hebrew.
They conclude that neither language presents a construction devoted to contrastive
focus. Further, they suggest that a categorical correspondence between one construction
and one type of focus may not exist.
In KK, however, there are constructions that clearly distinguish contrastive from
non-contrastive focus. Recall from §11.2.3.2 that 83% (n=74) of the [O=pura S V]
constructions expressed contrast following the operational definition proposed by
Myhill and Xing‟s (1996). The remaining examples (n=15, 17%) did not fulfill Myhill
and Xing‟s requirement as clear alternatives could not be traced in the previous
discourse, or, in Lambrecht‟s words, the relevant presuppositions were not always
lexico-grammatically evoked. Interestingly, also Myhill and Xing did find “clear cases712of implicit contrast” (1996:320). However, in KK, this subset of examples can be
accounted for when we recognize that contrast can be built on the basis of shared
cultural knowledge. Although operational definitions are important as a means of
avoiding circularity, we cannot ignore the danger of restricting our attention to only
overtly stated discourse context and thereby underestimating the importance of the
“universe of discourse.” In conclusion, KK suggests that we need to provide a place in
the grammar for dedicated contrastive focus constructions.
11.3. Selection of pronominal forms: grammar and discourse
As introduced in Chapter III, and pointed out throughout this dissertation, KK
has three sets of forms for expressing pronominal referents: long form free pronouns,
short form free pronouns, and enclitics. Upon looking at them, some questions arise: do
the different forms correspond to different meanings or functions? If yes, what kinds of
factors drive the choice of one form or another at the moment of the utterance? This
section is an attempt to answer those questions by examining natural discourse.
11.3.1. Assumptions and hypothesis
It has been noticed that the structure of expressions and their conceptualizations
seems to follow certain general principles. The principle of iconicity assumes that: i)
ideally, there is a coding relationship between one expression and one meaning, and ii)
the conceptual simplicity of a notion corresponds to the simplicity of its expression
(Croft 1993, Givón 1985, 1991, Haiman 1983). For example, the formal distance
between linguistic expressions may be an iconically motivated index of the conceptual
distance between the terms or events that they denote. It is also argued that functional-713cognitive principles, such as economy of mental effort, mediate specific instances of
iconicity in grammar (Givon 1991).
As for the existence of multiple forms with the “same” referent in the languages of
the world, Haiman (1983) points out:
Through sound change or borrowing, a language acquires doublets -more
or less synonymous ways of saying the same thing. […] True synonyms do
not long endure: presented with a minimally contrasting pair of
expressions, speakers will attempt to associate appropriately contrasting
meaning with them. What seems „appropriate‟ to speakers may often be
what is iconically motivated (Haiman 1983:800).
Though the existence of multiple forms could have historical explanations, I will
do not discuss their history here. Rather, what I want to explore is the modern forces
that drive their distribution in natural texts.
A first look at the properties of pronominal forms in the language indicates that
in certain constructions, only certain pronominal forms are allowed, whereas in others,
any pronominal form is accepted. The hypothesis behind this section is then that, in
constructions where multiple forms are grammatical, the pragmatic information status
of the referent correlates with speaker‟s choices of pronominal forms in actual use. That
is, speakers, by using these three sets of forms, give different amounts of information to
the hearers, establishing an iconic relationship between the phonological size of the
grammatical form and the amount of information that it carries. By “amount of
information” I mean the quality and quantity of semantic-pragmatic instructions that the714speaker gives in order for the hearer to build mental representations within the universe
of discourse.
Since personal pronouns are definite and referring by definition, notions such as
referentiality and definiteness do not seem to be helpful in explaining the data.
However, I will refer to the pragmatic function of focus as introduced in §11.1.2,
because it proves to be relevant in describing the functions of the different pronominal
forms in KK.
11.3.2. Long forms, short forms and clitics
As introduced in Chapter V, KK has three sets of pronominal forms: long form
free pronouns, short form free pronouns, and enclitics. The language also distinguishes
between masculine speech (MS) and feminine speech (FS) in the pronominal
paradigms; gender is marked according to the speaker and not in reference to what they
are talking about. The opposition between long and short free pronouns is only available
in the singular — specifically in first person feminine speech, second person feminine
and masculine speech, and third person masculine speech, whereas the opposition
between independent forms versus enclitics is present through the whole paradigm.
The complete paradigm of pronouns for female speech (FS) and male speech
(MS) is resented in Table 11.3. Notice the differences in form according to speaker‟s
gender for first singular, third singular, first plural exclusive and third plural. There is
an additional set of enclitic forms exclusively for third person object that were not
included in the table below. These are: =ay / =ura for female/male speech respectively.","[738, 739, 740, 741, 742, 743, 744]"

having SOV argument structure (34); however, recall that this ordering is generally not
accepted except in the progressive aspect, hence the oddity indicated in (34) via the #

„Maybe the mosquito is throwing you away‟ (ED)#SOVThe examples in (35) show the mirror-image phenomenon: in progressivemarked clauses with the syntactic configuration [NP NP V], the automatic argument
structure interpretation is SOV. Thus, when the first NP is a long form pronoun, this is
consistent with its role as subject (35a). However, if the second NP is a long form, it
becomes odd because speakers want to interpret it as the S argument, creating the order
OSV, which is not acceptable in progressive-marked clauses (35b).

hit-PROG#OSV / #SOVIn (36) we see again the tendency for short forms to be interpreted as objects:
when the second NP is a short form pronoun, speakers interpret it as the object, which is
consistent with the expected ordering pattern of SOV (36a). However, when the short
form appears in first position, there is a mismatch that results in an odd sentence (36b).
Note that the patterns given in (36a-b) were not found in texts.

Although speakers consistently prefer the second NP in [NP NP V]
constructions to be a long form, in natural texts we can find examples of pronouns from
all three sets in this slot. Of course, the discourse context ameliorates any possible
confusion about which argument is being expressed by the pronominal. In fact, one of
the most frequent patterns in texts is for the subject pronoun to cliticize to the main
predicate in both the OSV (37a) and SVO pattern (37b).

3SG.F=leave 3SG.F=yucca.beer
„With his wife he leaves his yucca beer‟718A final note to consider is that in constructions with the SVO configuration
where not other morphology occurs after O and when the second singular pronoun is the
object argument, only the long form ene is accepted among the three forms. Further, ene
generally appears cliticized to the verb (38a-b). This is also true for questions (38c).
However, if other morphology —i.e., tense or modality— follows the object, the form
that shows up as O is the clitic =n= (39a-b). That is, speakers avoid the short form as the
object in the SVO order. A possible explanation for this could be the homophony
between the quotative na and the second person short form na. Perhaps the motivating
factor for speakers to use ene is to avoid ambiguities that may arise in examples like
(40), when two morphemes na could potentially occur in sequence and there is no
morphology to indicate the boundary of the VP, hence which is the object. While this
explanation account for the majority of the data, in the corpus there are still instances of
=ene acting as the object which are not followed by the quotative na.

Up to here we can conclude that the distributions of pronominal forms can bepartially accounted for by looking at the constructions in which they can occur. For
instance, while short forms and clitics operate as possessive pronouns, long forms do
not. However, in certain constructions all three sets are allowed. Thus, grammar alone
cannot account for the distribution of pronouns in KK.
11.3.4. Distribution of pronominal forms motivated by discourse
In this section I explore other parameters that could trigger the distribution of
pronominal forms. Specifically, I evaluate whether or not information structure plays a
role in the speaker‟s choice among the three sets of forms.
11.3.4.1.","[745, 746, 747, 748, 749]"
"396But, it is possible to say that there is a particular morpheme ordering favored in KK
verbs? If there is, what word formation patterns are the most frequent (number of
tokens), and which the most productive (number of verbs they combine with)? Is there
any order that should never be found? In the following paragraphs it will be shown that
suffix ordering in KK verbs is not random.

allowable orders: progressive-patterns versus non-progressive patterns.
As mentioned above, in KK both syntax and pragmatics play a role in the
distribution of the several order patterns that are available. The syntactic factors have
been discussed in several places, including Chapter VII and VIII. In §11.4.2, I explore
the pragmatic forces behind the distribution of these syntactic configurations, by means
of a frequency study.
11.4.2. A frequency study of constituent order
The database for this study is composed of three traditional stories from three
speakers, comprising a total of 1003 intonation units. Out of this total number of units,
only 682 (68% of the total) were declarative sentences. The remaining units included
questions (4%), imperatives and requests (3%), non-verbal predicates (3%),
subordinated clauses — which appear in the intonation unit following their
corresponding matrix clauses — (7%), and others such as vocatives, false starts,
repeated fragments, etc. (15%). From now on, I will focus on declarative sentences
alone; as such, the total number of units under evaluation (N) is 682. The patterns of
distribution are presented in Table 11.7. While a possible order (and attested elsewhere
in the text database), it should be pointed out that the order OVS was not attested in this
particular set of texts. Figure 11.4 shows these results more visually.","[760, 761]"
"606Additional examples that illustrate this function are given in (61). Note that all
of them display OSV order. As expected, headless relative clauses combine with
morphology dedicated to express focus, such as =pura (as in (61a)) and the restrictive
marker =nan (as in 61b). For a detailed discussion of focus constructions, see Chapter
XI (§11.2).

However, many instances of headless relative clauses appear in the canonical
constituent orders, as well. In the examples below, the matrix clause in which the
relativized clause appears displays the order SVO. In these cases, there is no apparent
emphasis on any particular argument. These specific utterances happen to occur towards
the end of their corresponding narratives, seeming to function as wrap-up sentences.

Finally, a few headless relative clauses in the corpus could be characterized as
afterthoughts. In this role, as well, they assume the canonial, restrictive function: to
specify the referent of a pronominal element for which competing candidates exist. In
(63), the relative clause further specifies the demonstrative pronoun kuin „this‟ which is
syntactically encoded as the subject of the previous utterance.

This section examines the discourse distribution of postnominal and prenominal
relative clauses, that is relative clauses that follow and precede their head nouns,
respectively. As described in Chapter V, regarding the noun phrase, modifiers like
demonstratives, numerals, and other nouns precede the noun they modify. Relative
clauses, however, can either precede or follow the head noun. In this section we will see
that the position of the relative clause with respect to the head noun correlates with the
semantic relationship between the two.
In elicitation, prenominal and postnominal relative clauses seem to be
semantically equivalent, that is, speakers give both patterns and most are aware of no
apparent semantic consequences. Some consultants, however, suggest that the first
element may be contrastive (64).","[635, 636, 637]"

tense. In the progressive construction in (6a), the first NP is interpreted as the subject,
and the second as the object. In contrast, in the non-progressive construction in (6b), the
first is the object and the second is the subject.
Although tense and progressive hardly ever co-occur within a single verbal
word, at the notional level there would seem to be nothing preventing the combination
of tense and progressive. In KK, an auxiliary construction can be used to mark a clause
with both categories. In this construction, the progressive suffixes to the verb and the
tense marker cliticizes to the auxiliary (for a discussion on auxiliaries see Chapter VII).

In the language there are three markers of past and two markers for future which
report different degrees of temporal distance, taking the utterance moment as the point
of reference. The tense clitics occur at the end of the VP. So, in intransitive clauses,
they go after the verb, and in pragmatically unmarked transitive constructions, they go
after the object argument. Examples in (1a, b), above, show the intransitive pattern
where the tense attaches to the verb. Examples in (2a, b) give the transitive pattern in
which tense follows the object.
The complete set of tense clitics is presented in Table 9.1, together with the
temporal scope they cover. Note that the future markers also imply modality meanings.","[498, 499]"
"463speech acts of statements, inquiry, and requests. However, the correlation between
sentence types and speech acts is by no means one-to-one. For instance, although in KK
declarative sentences are employed primarily to make statements and claims about the
world, in the appropriate context they can also be employed to elicit information, to
convey a request, to express a wish, etc.
I start the discussion with an outline of a simple verbal clause construction in
KK (§9.1). Here I list the main elements that occur within a simple verbal clause. Next I
discuss constituent ordering, a key aspect in the characterization of verbal constructions
in KK (§9.1.1). In KK, two grammatical categories that are typically characterized at
the verb-level, in other languages must be described at the clause level. These are tense
(§9.1.1.3) and modality (9.1.2).
The second part of this chapter is dedicated to the grammatical devices that the
language employs to perform different speech acts. In §9.2, I describe declarative
sentences. I start with a formal characterization of the grammatical relations of subject
and object, and contrast them with obliques (§9.2.1), and then discuss the functional
load of declarative sentences (§9.2.2). From a semantic-functional perspective,
negative clauses could be considered a subtype of declarative clauses; however, for
reasons of clarity in the presentation, they are discussed in their own section (§9.3). In
§9.4, I present interrogative sentences, including polar and content questions. Directive
sentences, discussed in §9.5, is a category that subsumes several constructions,
including imperative, polite imperative, exhortative, jussive, invitation, prohibition, and
future/irrealis prohibition.","[492, 493]"
"405In (112) there is a set of elicited examples with the intransitive verb „take a

e. *inuyatsuk(a)=upaAs for the unacceptability of (112e), what happens is that, because the upa has
been grammaticalized into the completive suffix -pa, only the latter is allowed. Notice
that if the auxiliary were allowed, the main verb would lose its final vowel, and the
output would be *yatsuk=upa; however, only yatsuka-pa is accepted. However, there is
another auxiliary construction that allows the combination of the auxiliary upa and the
completive suffix -pa within the same clause (see §7.3.4)
In this auxiliary construction, the main verb takes any aspectual morphology,
including the completive (113a) and the reiterative (113b). If this is the case, the AUX406can optionally attach to the verbal word or appear as an independent word; either way
tense markers attach to the auxiliary. Examples in (113) are also elicited data.

The examples in (114) show this construction in examples from texts. For
instance, in (114a), the main verb is „go down‟, and the auxiliary is the venitive „come.‟
Example (114d) is especially revealing, showing yuti as both, the main verb „stay‟ and
as the durative auxiliary.

As mentioned earlier, this construction is also employed with transitive verbs.
The elicited examples in (115) show eyu „eat‟ as the main verb. The verb eyu is one of
those ambivalente verbs that can function with or without an object (see (108) for its407intransitive counterpart). Note that the auxiliary can optionally attached to the
pronominal object, or occur independently and be clitiziced by the tense marker.

does not attach to the auxiliary (116a-b). When the object is fronted, the auxiliary
immediately follows the main verb (116c). However, when the object is a pronominal it
can appear prefixed to the auxiliary (116d). Tense clitics also attach to right edge of the
auxiliary (116d).

As indicated earlier, the constructiton [S V (O)=AUX (=TNS)] is the most
frequent in the database, and also the most productive in the sense that, in theory, any
verb (intransitive, stative, and transitive) can operate as the main predicate within the
construction.
7.3.3.2. [Aux S V (O)]
This second NPAC is quite frequent in discourse. However, out of the five
auxiliaries under discussion, only two —upa „finish‟ and utsu „go‟— have been attested
in this construction. When the AUX is upa, the main verb carries the completive marker
-pa (117a-d). However, the completive aspect is not required when the AUX is the
andative utsu (119). The main predicate could be an intransitive verb as in (118) &
(119), or a transitive verb as in (120).12

as the completive aspect marker suffixed to the main verb.

Note in (141c) that utsu appears twice: as an auxiliary in front of the subject, and
as the main verb following the subject. It should be pointed out that in (141d) the
„andative‟ is not indicating spacial deixis, that is, direction away from the speaker. It
rather conveys temporal deixis towards the point of reference, which is away from the
moment of the utterance.

place is: [AUX S V (=)O ].

7.3.4. Progressive-marked auxiliary constructions (PAC)
In contrast to NPAC, in PAC constructions, the main verb must be marked by
the progressive. Recall that the main progressive-marked constituent orders are SOV
and VS. This also applies to auxiliary constructions. There are two PAC constructions;
in the first, the main predicate can be either intransitive or transitive. If an object is
involved, the auxiliary appears between the subject and the object (§7.3.4.1). In
contrast, in the second construction only intransitive verbs occur. In this case, the main
verb appears fronted and the auxiliary follows the subject (§7.3.4.2).
7.3.4.1. [S Aux (O) V-ri]
In contrast to NPAC constructions (7.3.3.1), the O — if any — precedes the
main verb and the auxiliary occurs between the subject and the O argument. In this
construction, all auxiliaries are attested except the completive upa.

Example (1a) is a finite transitive clause. In (1b) there is a complex noun phrasethat contains a nominalized clause. Note the nominalized verb in final position, suffixed569by the nominalizer -n, and then by the affective and focus morpheme, which show that
this syntactic unit is a NP. This NP could in turn appear embedded in a matrix clause.
We now go on to examine each of the various ways in which KK combines clauses.
10.2 . Complement clauses
Complement clauses are defined as constructions in which a clause is the
syntactic argument of a matrix clause. The embedded clause can potentially assume
either subject or object argument function.
In KK, complement clauses are morphologically unmarked and restricted to
object function. The embedded clause and the matrix clause may or may not share
verbal arguments. Depending on the semantic type of the matrix verb the embedded
clause is fully finite, keeping its full array of arguments. Then, a complement sentence
construction includes a matrix clause with the subject in first position, a complementtaking-verb (CTV), and an embedded clause acting as its direct object. The complement
construction could be schematically summarized as: [S V1 [(S) V2 (O)]]. Examples with
the prototypical CTV tseta „want‟ are given in (2) and (3); the embedded clause is in
brackets.

NEG get.in-CAUtana]=tsuriay
1PL.EX.M=PAS3tana]=tsuriay
1PL.EX.M=PAS3 (ED)From these examples, the first generalization we can make is that complement
clauses follow the matrix verb. Second, the embedded verb can be intransitive (2a-b),
transitive (3a), or derived transitive (3b). As discussed in Chapter VIII, one of the key
features to determine the structure of a clause is the placement of the tense clitics. In
complement clauses, tense clitics attach to the right edge of the embedded construction,
as in (2b) and (3b). Also, note the distribution of the adverb amutse „far‟ in (3a), which
appears at the very end of the clause. The adverb is not part of the embedded clause
because, upon elicitation, it can also appear in first position without any semantic
consequences. As for negation, in Chapter IX we learned that KK has two negative
particles: tɨma and ni. The former negates the entire construction by placing it in front
of the clause or in front of the verb phrase, the latter negates only the argument that
follows it. In (2b) and (3b) tɨma negates the whole complex sentence, but it cannot571negate the dependent clause alone; that is, it cannot be placed between the matrix verb
„want‟ and the dependent verb aki „get in‟ (2c) or akita „let in‟ (3c).
In KK complement constructions, modal markers only appear in the matrix
clause, not within the complement clause. In (4a) the second position modal =ray
„speculative‟ is attached to the subject of „want‟, and in (4b), the modal clitic =mia
„irrealis‟ appears at the edge of the complement clause, which coincides with the end of
the verb phrase.

wellɨtsɨwatsu]=mia
deer=MODIt is well documented that, cross-linguistically, the grammar of complementation
is one of the clearest expressions of iconicity in syntax (Givón 2001). The basic
prediction is that: “the stronger is the semantic bond between the two events, the more
extensive will be the syntantic integration of the two clauses into a single though
complex clause” (Givon 2001:40). To examine this principle, verbs are often classified
into three categories: modality verbs, manipulation verbs, and perception-cognitionutterance (PCU) verbs. The claim is that the first two types of verbs semantically
indicate events with the strongest bond, hence the complement clause often presents
greater syntactic integration with the matrix clause; the third group shows the weakest
semantic-cognitive bond between events, and hence generally the least syntactic
integration of the complement clause.
572In KK complementation, the iconicity principle manifests not in terms of
morphological coding, but in terms of co-reference restrictions that hold between the
subject or object of the main clause and the subject of the complement clause. However,
among the three types of verbs suggested by Givón, only complement clauses with
modality and PCU main verbs display syntactic differences compared to each other.
Manipulation verbs are not a type on their own. Typologically, in complement clauses
with manipulation verbs the object of the main clause is coreferentialial with the subject
of the complement clause, where it is left unexpressed. Some of the prototypical
manipulation verbs are: „allow‟, „cause‟, „make‟, „tell‟, „ask‟, and „order.‟(Givón 2001).
KK does not have verbs for „allow‟ and „cause‟ — although causation is an extremely
productive derivational process— and „make‟ does not function as a manipulation verb.
The only manipulation verbs in the language would be wanakari „order,‟ piyata
„ask‟and kumitsa + DAT „tell‟.1 Yet these would be better characterized as utterance
verbs, as they occur mostly with direct and indirect quotes. Most importantly, the quotes
are syntactically independent, so these verbs do not take complement clauses.
In what follows, I discuss complementation with modality verbs (§10.2.1) and
PCU verbs (§10.2.2), then close the section with a discussion of the syntax of clauses
with quotes (§10.2.3).
10.2.1 . Modality verbs
In clauses with modality verbs, the complement clause lacks independent tenseaspect-mood marking and appears in the typical object position, generally under the

dative phrase : kumitsa „speak‟, [kumitsa OBJ] „say‟, [kumitsa DAT] „tell‟.","[598, 599, 600, 601, 602]"

workIn terms of function, while long forms are used for encoding salient referents,
short form pronouns occur by default typically referring to core arguments low in
salience. The extract in (40) would be a typical introduction of referents into the
discourse. The pattern is: First, a full NP for the first mention, then a long form pronoun209for a salient piece of information, and from there on short form pronouns occur (or
clitics, see below) for already activated participants.

In (40a) a new participant, „white monkey‟, is introduced. Next, this participantis expressed by the long form pronoun which shows that this information is focus. After
that, the same participant, now low in salience, is referred by a short form.
The same analysis (i.e., low salience) applies to short forms occurring within
subordinate clauses. In (37a) notice the short form tsa „I‟ in the subordinate clause of
purpose. In my earlier work (Vallejos 2004), the appearance of the long form ene
attached to the verb in object function was explained as a strategy for avoiding
homophony (when the following element is the quotative particle na, for instance).
However, when more texts were added to the database, it becomes apparent that
homophony does not account for all the data. An alternative explanation is offered at
the end of §5.3.3.
5.3.3. Clitic pronouns
Clitic pronouns are the further reductions of short forms, used to refer to
recurring participants in core grammatical relations. Recall that in order to have wellformed clauses, arguments generally must occur explicitly. Clitics can fulfill this
functional requirement for established participants. From a phonological point of view,210clitic pronouns are basically morpho-phonological processes applied to independent
short form subject pronouns as a result of colloquial and fast speech. The rule that
applies to the whole paradigm could be generalized as: if a pronoun occurs before a
word that starts with a vowel, the pronoun loses its stress and its last vowel and
becomes attached to the subsequent element; if the following word starts with a
consonant, the pronoun loses its stress but retains its vowel. Examples in (41) illustrate
clitic pronouns in subject function. Relevant clitics are in bold.

liveMost of the distributional patterns of the three sets of pronouns can be predicted
by grammar and pragmatics. The exception is that the distribution of pronouns in the
syntactic function of object is not always obvious. It seems that prosody also plays a
role. As stated earlier, in elicitation all long forms, short forms and clitics can fulfill the
object function. However, in language use, the following patterns have been observed.
If the object pronominal is the last element in the phonological verbal word, the forms
that occur in the object slot are the long form pronouns generally appear cliticized to the
verbal word as object (43a-c), although not necessarily (43d).

However, if there is a clitic following the object pronoun —such as tense, focus,a modal, etc.— the O argument usually shows up as an independent short form pronoun
to which the clitic in question gets attached.3 This is illustrated below.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"Contrastive-narrow focus constructionsThe clitic =pura does not always occur in structures displaying canonical
constituent order. Recall that an unmarked clause could be summarized as: (ADV) S V
(O) (OBL). Constructions where a pura-marked O or oblique NP appears fronted have
contrastive interpretations. Following Chafe, an utterance is contrastive if there is a set
of possible alternatives for the element being contrasted. To identify the set of689alternatives, I follow, to some extent, the methodology provided by Myhill and Xing
(1996).6
11.2.3.2.1. Marking NPs in the O argument function
The interaction of =pura with the pragmatically marked ordering OSV is one of the
strategies to express contrastive-narrow focus. In the examples (12-14), the focus
constituent is a full NP, or a long form pronoun, in the O argument function. In terms of
prosody, the stress occurs on the pura-marked NP.

"They are generally embedded in a noun phrase; that is, the relative clause together with
the head noun create a single complex noun phrase. From a functional perspective, a
relative clauses narrow the set of potential referents to those referents of which the
proposition expressed in the relative clause is true. In other words, it “delimits the
reference of a NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the relative clause” (Andrews 2007:206).
As discussed by multiple typologists (e.g., Comrie 1998, Givón 2001, Shibatani
2007), relative clauses can by characterized according to several parameters, including
the strategy for recovery of the identity of the head argument inside the relative clause
(among others, gap, resumptive pronoun, relative pronoun, and referring
nominalization), the position of the relative clause with respect to the head noun
(prenominal, postnominal, head-internal, headless, or paratactic), and the syntactic
function of the relativized element within the relative clause (relativization of A, S, O,
etc.).
The relevant strategies for forming relative clauses in KK are nominalization
and a gap for the relativized noun. Reganding the position of the head noun with respect
to the relative clause, the types of relative clauses that KK displays are headed and583headless relative clauses. In headed clauses, the head is external to the relative clause
either prenominal or postnominal. In the remaining subsections of this section, I offer a
formal characterization of argument nominalization/relative clauses (§10.3.1), followed
by a discussion of the functional load of headless versus headed relative clauses
(§10.3.2), and prenominal versus postnominal relative clauses (§10.3.2.2)
10.3.1 . Relative clause formation
Cross-linguistically, one of the most common strategies employed in relative
clause formation is creating a gap. That is, the relative clause contains no overt
reference to the head noun, but the role of the head noun is recognized by the fact that it
is absent, or “gapped”, from the relative clause. Another widely attested mechanism is
the use of a relative pronoun: here the position relativized is indicated by means of a
clause-initial pronominal element which is marked to specify the role of the head noun
within the relative clause. Resumptive pronoun is the strategy by which the position
relativized is explicitly indicated by means of an anaphoric pronominal form in its
normal position in the relative clause. Relative clauses also often involve nonfinite verb
forms, such as nominalizations, and special word order restrictions.
KK does not have a specific subordination construction whose canonical
function is to encode a relative clause. The language makes use of nominalized
structures for functionally relative constructions. The grammatical relations that can be
relativized on are O , S, A, and OBL (dative, locative). It is possible to say that, to
some degree, KK employs nominalization as a means to identify the grammatical role
of the relativized element. In relative clauses with transitive verbs, one knows which is584the relativized argument by looking at the the suffix that attaches to the verb. Relative
clause formation follows an absolutive pattern, with S and O relativized by suffixing -n
to the subordinate verb (cf. §10.3.1.1- §10.3.1.2), whereas A is relativized by suffixing
-tara to the subordinate verb (cf. §10.3.1.3).
10.3.1.1 . Relativization of S
Relativization of the single argument in an intransitive clause is achieved via a
combination of two strategies: gap and the morpheme -n. More specifically, the
relativized intransitive verb bears -n and then appears either before or after the head
noun, which is understood as being coreferential to the absent S of the relativized verb
(schematically N [Ø V-n] / [Ø V-n] N). The elicited examples in (23a-c) show this
pattern, with the relative clause in brackets and the head noun in bold.

"Interrogative sentences
Interrogative clauses are typically used for eliciting information. The languagehas two types of questions: polar questions and content questions. Polar questions are
created by means of the second position clitic =tipa plus a word order alternation.
Information questions are formed by means of interrogative pronouns.
Faust (1972:88) claims that Kokama has a third type of interrogative
construction: indirect questions. Faust indicates that, in addition to =tipa, Kokama has
three other interrogative suffixes, -taku,-raku and -nda, which she says are employed to
create indirect questions. Cabral (1995:216, 351) echoes this claim. Here are the
examples provided by Faust (1972:88). The orthographic adaptation, glossing and
translation are mine.

d. yuka-taku na

2SG mother
„Maybe that one is your mother‟
(Tal vez ésa es tu mamá. ¿Es ésa, tal vez, tu mamá?)
According to my analysis, examples (102a-c) are in fact questions. They are
content questions, not because of the suffixes -nda, -raku, or -taku but rather because
they involve the interrogative pronoun awa „who.‟ Contrast these with Faust‟s example
(102d), which does not include an interrogative pronoun, and whose primary
interpretation is hence not that of a question but a weak statement (see §9.4.2 for a
discussion of content questions). As for the markers themselves, -taku (=taka, in this
variety) indicates uncertain modality (see §9.1.2.1.4). The forms -raku and -nda are not
attested in the database for this study. In conclusion, in this variety, only =tipa operates
as an interrogative marker.
In the following paragraphs I describe in some detail polar questions (§9.4.1)
and content questions (§9.4.2).
9.4.1. Polar questions
Polar question are typically employed to inquire about the truth or falsity of the
proposition they express often with focus on one specific part of the proposition (Givón
2001). Cross-linguistically, six strategies to encode polar questions have been found.
These are “(i) special intonation patterns, (ii) interrogative particles, (iii) the addition of
special tags, (iv) disjunctive-negative structures, (v) a change in the relative order of537constituents and (vi) particular verbal inflection” (König & Siemund, 2007:292). KK
employs three of these strategies to form polar questions: the interrogative particle
=tipa, constituent order alternation, and, more marginally, intonation.

"S/O nominalizer -nWithout a doubt, the morpheme -n is the most powerful of all the nominalizers
attested in the language. It is extremely frequent and derives nouns that occur in several
nominal syntactic positions. In terms of meaning, this morpheme generates object
nominalizations from transitive verbs (75), and subject nominalization from intransitive
(76) and stative verbs (77).7 As such, it is an absolutive nominalizer.
7The morpheme -n is also an absolutive relativizer, as shown in the examples below. For more discussion
on relative clauses, see Chapter X, §10.2.

English as cazar „hunt‟ and saber „know,‟ both of which can appear in either
intransitive or transitive construction in Spanish. While in KK this is true for ikua
„know,‟ the verb ipurkari „hunt‟ only appears in intransitive constructions; that is, it
never takes an object (although some speakers may accept one in elicitation). Also, ikua
is interpreted as „knowledge‟ twice in the corpus; that is as a noun without any overt
derivation.

There are a few instances where the resulting nouns have idiosyncraticmeanings. For instance, the nominalizer on the verb „go up the river‟ produces a
reference to the upper parts of a river, usually translated into Spanish as cabecera.

adverbial, and in (81b) is used as a noun.
