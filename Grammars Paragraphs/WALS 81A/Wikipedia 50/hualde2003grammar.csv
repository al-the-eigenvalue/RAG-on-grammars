aux4.3. Word order
J. Ortiz de Urbina
4.3.1. Neutral order
This section deals with word order at the clausal level, as opposed to ordering constraints inside phrases, which are discussed in the sections devoted
to the latter. While phrase internal order is largely fixed, phrase combination
is not rigid in Basque. All the permutations of the bracketed constituents in
the following example produce grammatical sentences in Basque:
(745) [Ene aitak]
myfather.ERG[amari]fgona gorria]mother.DATskirt[ekarri dio].red.DET bringaux'My father brought mother a red skirt.'
Different orders produce different prominence configurations, the most important of which, the focal interpretation of preverbal elements, is discussed
in section 4.4.
Most Basque grammarians have identified SOV as the 'neutral' or 'basic' order (de Rijk 1969; Villasante 1980:17, also calls it 'aseptic'). Lafitte
(1944:46) considers the sequence subject-adjunct-indirect object-direct object-attribute-verb the 'neutral' or 'purely grammatical' style, as in the example:
(746) AitaSainduak atzofather holy.ERGyesterdaybierresumeriaphezpikutwonation.DATbishopbat ararteko igorri diote.
one mediator send aux
""The Holy Father sent yesterday a bishop to the two nations as mediator.'
The neutral order subject-indirect object-direct object is in a mirror image
relationship with respect to the markers which cross-reference these arguments in the tensed verbal form.",[478]
"4.3.3. Neutral order and focalization
The adjective 'neutral' applied to the SOV order is intended to imply that no
constituent is emphasized for contrastive or emphatic purposes over the others. Such 'focalization' gives rise to one of the most robust word order constraints in Basque, discussed at length in 4.4: foci (and wh-words) immediately precede the verbal element. The claim that SOV is the 'basic' word
order tries to capture the oft-noted intuition that while the preverbal object
in this order need not be interpreted as 'emphatic', any other preverbal argument in any other order (and perhaps the verb itself in the verb-initial orders VSO and VOS) is usually construed as focalized. This is true even in
dialects where at least one constituent must bear focal stress (as in the
Lekeitio variety described in Hualde et al. 1994), since it is only a preverbal
object with focal stress that may be interpreted as informationally unemphatic.
The Lekeitio facts correspond quite closely with Altube's (1929) description, which indicates that the latter is valid for at least some Bizkaian or
western dialects. The pattern described by Altube has become a quasinormative system followed, more or less consciously, by writers of the literary, unified dialect. The oral tradition of other dialects and the written practice before this century, established outside of the normativizing influence
of Altube's work, seems to have been different. Hidalgo (1995, 1999) points
out that postverbal focalized elements were common, rising to frequencies
higher than for preverbal foci the more complements and adjuncts are addedWord Order455to the verb. The possibility of emphasizing constituents in different positions places fewer constraints on word order in such varieties.","[484, 485]"
"Word Order449The 'neutral' positioning of dative nominale is in fact more complex than
Lafitte's template indicates. While it is true that datives precede absolutive
objects, they follow absolutive subjects. Thus, (a) is less marked than (b):
(747) a. Jon sendagileari joan
Jondoctor.DATgozaio.
AUX'Jon went to the doctor.'
b. Sendagileari Jon joan zaio.
However, ethical datives or experiencer datives in psychological predicates
do sound more neutral when preceding the absolutive subject (Zabala 1995,
Zabala & Odriozola 1996):
(748) Sendagileari
doctor.DATamonahilzaio.grandmotherdieAUX'The doctor's grandmother died (on him).'
(749) Sendagilearikafeagustatzenzaio.doctor.DATcoffeelike.lMPFAUX'The doctor likes coffee.'
Some fixed ordering phenomena seem to reflect the basic unmarked order. Thus, when there is a constraint on the relative order of arguments, it is
always the subject-object order that is required. This is, for instance, the order of interrogative pronouns in double wh-questions (4.4.6.3.1.2):
(750) Etazureprestutasunaz... nork zererranendu?andyourvirtue.LNSTRwhosay.FUTAUXwhat'And about your virtue, who will say what?' [Ax. 2]
Similarly, post-auxiliary focalization in negative clauses may affect any
element in immediate pre-participial position, but only constituents in their
neutral position may be interpreted as emphasized if not to the left of the
participle. Moreover, the focalized interpretation may 'spread' from the preparticipial position to include other constituents provided that all of them
occupy their 'basic' neutral position (cf. 4.4.7.2.1 for a detailed discussion
of these constraints). The basic verb-final character of Basque may also be
seen in the fact that when the position of verbs is constrained, they are required to occupy a final position (as in relatives, and, more loosely, in some
other embedded contexts, see 4.10.2). Some processing strategies also rely450 Syntaxon 'neutral' order templates. Thus, without a disambiguating context, absolutive sequences are interpreted as subject-object sequences:
(751) Jon Mikel
JonMikelari daikusten.arisee.lMPFAUX'Jon is seeing Mikel.'
Moreover, as indicated in 4.8.2.3, dative sequences in causatives are least
acceptable when they have the same grammatical person, perhaps due to
processing difficulty. However, if at all, the preferred interpretation would
be one where the first dative (Mikeli 'to Mikel' in the following example)
refers to the logical subject of the action brought about by the causer (sal'sell' here), and the second one corresponds to the goal:
(752)HGurasoekMikeliJonietxeasalerazidiote.parents.ERGMikel.DATJon.DAThousesell.CAUSEAUX'His parents made Mikel/Jon sell the house to Mikel/Jon.'
Along with the verb-finality of relative clauses, parsing ease might underlie
these interpretational preferences, but the fact that the preferences are these
and not the opposite may stem from basic structural patterns of the language.
While the neutral position of argumental phrases seems to be as described so far, the distributional properties of adjuncts are far less well understood. Osa (1990) already pointed out that some adverbs tend to occur in
focal position. Elordieta (2001), on the other hand, points out that there exists a difference between manner VP adverbs (at least simple ones like
txarto 'badly', ondo 'well', tinko 'firmly') and sentence adverbs. Manner
adverbs typically occur in the preverbal position in neutral, verb-final contexts:
(753)(*ondo) Jonek
(??ondo) azken azterketa
well
Jon.ERG well
last
exam
burutu
du.
complete AUX
'John completed the last exam well.'(ondo)
wellHowever, in marked sentences where some other element is focalized, their
position is freer:Word Order 451(754) a. Jonek
AZKEN
AZTERKETA
burutu
zuen ondo.
Jon.ERG last
exam
complete AUX well
'It was the last exam that Jon completed well.'
b. JONEK burutu zuen azken azterketa ondo.
'it was Jon who completed the last exam well.'
These adverbs differ from sentential adverbs, which, according to Elordieta
(2001) have a freer distribution:
(755) a.(atzo)
Jonek
(atzo) ipuinak (atzo) kontatu zituen.
yesterday Jon.ERG yest. tales
yest. tell
AUX
'Yesterday Jon told some tales.'
b. (*ondo) Jonek
(*ondo) ipuinak (ondo) kontatu zituen.
well
Jon.ERG well
tales
well
tell
AUX
'Jon told some tales well.'","[478, 479, 480, 481]"
"452 Syntax4.3.2. Heavy constituents
As in English, heavy elements, especially clauses, tend to occur to the right
in Basque (Hidalgo 1996). Thus, while the neutral position of nominal objects is the preverbal one, that of clausal objects can be postverbal. As a result, the SVO order need not contain a focalized subject when Ο is a clause
(see also 4.10.1.1.1.8):
(758) Jonek
Jon.ERGesan duMikelekerlojuagaldusayMikel.ERGwatch,loseAUXduela.
AUX.COMP'Jon said that Mikel lost the watch.'
In fact, Hualde et al. (1994) report, that, in the Lekeitio dialect, this is virtually the only context where the preverbal element need not bear focal stress
(see 4.3.3 below). Al tube (1929) also mentions this order as occurring quite
frequently in the language, even though, from a normative perspective, he
considered it ill-formed.
The tendency for heavy, clausal elements to occur to the right is more
marked with subjects of copulative predicates, as pointed out by Zabala
(2000):
(759) Egia
truth.DETda tenperaturakonstanteadela.isconstant.DETis.COMPtemperature'It is true that the temperature is constant.'
(760) Garbi dagotenperaturakonstanteadela.cleartemperatureconstant.DETis.COMPis'It's clear that the temperature is constant.'
This is not restricted to intransitive subject clauses, as shown in the following examples, where the embedded clause will not usually occur before the
verb unless focalized:
(761) Konturatu
realizedaetxeaninorezzegoela.","[481, 482]"
"Similarly, more than one phrase could constitute new information or the
focus of the utterance, provided the right context. For instance, in a sentence
such as (7) the subject, indirect object and direct object could be the focus, if
the sentence were uttered in a situation in which it was apparent that some-Intonation79body bought something for somebody. Another possibility would be for the
indirect object and the direct object to be the focus of the utterance, if what
was known was that Miren gave something to someone, and we wanted to
know whom she gave what. What is important is that the same intonational
contour results in all cases, namely the one represented in Fig. 3.
When the neutral or canonical order of constituents is altered, however,
the whole utterance or other phrases apart from the preverbal one cannot be
the constituents conveying new or focalized information. Only the preverbal
phrase can be interpreted that way (cf. A. Elordieta 2001). Thus, in a sentence such as (8), where the direct object is postverbal, only the indirect object can be interpreted as new or focalized information.
(8) Mirenekumiariemon dotzo madari bat.","[108, 109]"
"Focalization461The presence of behintzat 'at least' forces Jonek to be interpreted as a topic
(de Rijk 1978), and the existence of this focus forces in turn the synthetic
verb to receive focal interpretation, reflected here by the prefix ba- (see
4.4.3.2.2). However, this argument for the topic/focus relationship is weakened if ba is interpreted not as a focus marker but as a particle supporting
the tensed verb, a clitic, in a context where no clausemate element to its left
is found (Ortiz de Urbina 1994). This situation emerges when the verb is
fronted to the left in focalization, but also if no other element is present in
the clause, as in the previous example.
At least in some varieties of the language, SOV sentences need not have
a focalized constituent. The situation may be different in some dialects like
the Lekeitio variety described in Hualde et al. (1994), where all main
clauses must contain an element with focal stress. This is no doubt related to
the fact that most words lack lexical accent in this dialect. Even there,
though, an SOV sentence with focal stress on the object may receive both
object emphatic or neutral interpretation. On the other hand, neutral interpretations are not found in clauses with a different word order.
At the same time, it is possible to have more than one constituent focalized. Just as two wh-words may cooccur in preverbal position, with paired
readings, two constituents may be emphasized with the same type of interpretation:
(795)KOTXEA ETXEAN utzi
nuen atzo
(ez giltza
car
at.home leave AUX yesterday not key
bulegoan).
office.the.in
Ί left THE CAR AT HOME yesterday, not the key in the office.'","[490, 491]"
"4.10.3.1.2. Word order within the relative clause
There is a strong word order constraint regarding one constituent within the
relative clause: the relative clause must end with the finite verb form to
which the complementizer is joined. There is no exception to this rule. Even
in negative clauses, where, apart from relatives, the main verb and other
words generally follow the finite auxiliary, the inflected verb must appear at
the end of the relative clause (see 4.5 and 4.10.2.3).
Consider the following example (a), which contains a negative relative
clause. Within this clause the last word is the inflected auxiliary to which
the complementizer is joined (zuen). The marker of negation (ez), although
written as a separate word in standard Basque, is a proclitic, and must precede the auxiliary:Subordination 767(1852) a.","[796, 797]"
"4.5.2.1.2. Finite embedded clauses
4.5.2.1.2.1. Declaratives
In embedded declarative clauses, the order of the constituents obeys two basic alternatives: in one, negation changes the basic relative order of the auxiliary and the lexical verb (1087a, b), as it does in matrix clauses. The complementizer -ela is an affix on the finite auxiliary:
(1087) a.",[552]
"[Altubekkontutanhartuezzueti]Altube.ERGaccount.LOCtakenot.AUX.COMPoinarrizko partiketa

AUX

Ί met with a basic distinction that Altube didn't take into account.' [Mitx. EIG IV: 101]
The word order found in the relative clause in (a) is not the one usually
found in sentences apart from relatives (see 4.5.2.1.2.1). In an ordinary
clause, the unmarked word order for the verbal expression in (a) would be
(b):
b.",[797]
"4.11.4.1. Gapping structures
4.11.4.1.1. Forward and backward gapping
It has been posited (Ross 1970) that the direction in which gapping occurs
in a language depends on its word order. Consequently, for SOV and SVO
languages respectively, the next two patterns would be expected:
SVO + SVO
SVO + SO
SOV + SOV -> SO + SOV
These two types have been called forward and backward gapping, respectively. As for Basque, Gastanaga (1977) argues that it has two possibilities
for gapping (examples in Bizkaian dialect):

Introduction
J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its name
The word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vascones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basquespeaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorrochategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, derived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is parallel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In postRenaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the westernmost dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the political border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a language'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

NEUKHEMENTXEIt is not possible to insert any non-focalized material intervening between
the focalized constituents. In any event, outside of cases like 'From where
to where', this focalization strategy is found in highly contrastive contexts.
Multiple wh-questions can be formed by coordinating wh-words:
(797) Noiz eta nola sortua da Sail
hori?
when and how born
is section that
'When and how was that section born?' [Mitx. EIG 1:115]462 Syntax(798) Non,
norekin
eta zertako eginen
dugu gerla?
where, who.with and why
make.FUT AUX war
'Where, with whom and why will we make war?' [Eliss. P.A.:89]
Occasionally, stacked wh-words may be found in some texts:
(799) Eta zure prestutasunaz... nork zer
erranen du?
and your virtue.on
who what say.FUT AUX
'And who will say what on your virtue?' [Ax. 2]
(800) Noiz nun
entzun duzu?
when where hear
AUX
'When (and) where did you hear it?' [Lafitte 1944:224]
Stacked foci and questions must be placed in an order corresponding to the
'neutral' order; thus, in (799) the order zer nork 'what who' and the order
etxean kotxea 'at home the car' in (795) would not be acceptable. See section 4.4.6 for pre-verbal foci and wh-words coexisting with yet other such
elements in different positions in the sentence.
Some morphological and syntactic devices produce emphasis which
quite often results in syntactic focalization of the marked constituent. Thus,
demonstratives and some adverbials may be attached the suffix -xe: horixe
'that very one', hementxe 'right here', oraintxe 'right now'; pronouns have
special intensive forms: ni Τ vs. neu Ί myself, zu 'you' vs. zeu 'you yourself; adjectives may be reduplicated for emphasis: zuri-zuria 'very white',
handi-handia 'very big'; phrases can also be emphasized by adding the demonstrative bera in apposition, marked with the same ending: Jonek berak
'Jon himself', zuzendariarentzat berarentzat 'for the director himself.
While elements thus marked are perfectly felicitous in pre-verbal position,
there seems to be some variation as to whether they can appear in non-focus
position. Many speakers reject intensive pronouns in non-focus position,
and the same is often reported for elements marked with the intensive
marker -xe (de Rijk 1978:106). However sentences like the following are
certainly acceptable for many speakers:
(801)Orain irakurri dituzun

'Those very books which you have read now, I read long ago.'","[491, 492]"
"4.5.2.1. Finite clauses

The standard word order in a Basque finite clause has the auxiliary following the verb:
(1068) a. Etxea erori da.
b. *etxea da
erori
house fall
AUX
house AUX fall
'The house has fallen down.'
And leaving aside a small set of modal and evidential particles (3.5.7), nothing can intervene between the lexical verb and the auxiliary:
(1069)* erori etxea daThe presence of negation however induces changes on this basic word order
pattern. The presence of negation forces the auxiliary to merge with it, and
precede linearly the lexical verb:
(1070) Etxea ez da erori.
Furthermore, there is no requirement of adjacency between the auxiliary and
the lexical verb:
(1071)Ez da etxea erori.",[548]
"If we try to keep the word order of (b) within a relative clause, the result is
absolutely unacceptable, because the last word within the relative clause is
not the inflected verb to which the complementizer is suffixed:
c.",[797]
"Jon.ERG ba.brings book
'It is Jon that IS bringing the book.'
However, as noted in section 4.4.1, it is possible to emphasize more than
one constituent as a unit in pre-verbal position, in highly contrastive contexts. In that case, emphasized constituents must follow the neutral order
(Subjec-Adjuncts-Ind. Object-Dir. Object; cf. section 4.3), as if focalization
were spreading to bigger and bigger chunks of the basic structure:

"4.10.3.3.7. Some characteristics of headless relative clauses
4.10.3.3.7.1. Word order within headless relative clauses
As seen above, there is a strong word order constraint in relative clauses:
the inflected verb must be the last constituent within the relative (see
4.10.3.1.2), and no other constituent can be extracted out of the relative (see
4.10.3.1.4.3). This constraint, however, is dramatically lightened when the
relative is a headless relative to which the determiner and case ending is di-808 Syntaxrectly joined. Indeed, in such cases, extraction is not blocked, provided the
extracted elements immediately follow the verb:
(1954) Ithorrotzen
ikusi dut Benat Berterreix
Ithorrotz.LOC see
AUX Benat Berterreix
[Lafittekin
ibili dena
eskolan].
Lafitte.C0M walk AUX.COMP.DET school.at
Ί saw in Ithorrotz Benat Berterreix who went to school with Lafitte.' [Arb. Pia:26]
In (1954), there is no discontinuous constituent, but the last constituent
within the phrase containing the appositive relative (between brackets) is
not the inflected verb, to which the determiner is joined (dena), but the locative NP (eskolan 'at school'). This is especially likely when the relative is
long and contains many or complex constituents:
(1955) Ikusikodugubadirelanolanahikoizakiak,see.FUTAUXba.areanyhow.RELbeings(...),Iezdirenakezgizonezkoaketaeznotare.COMP.DET.PLnotmenandnotemakumezkoakezezik,ezharraketawomennotonlynotmale.DET.PLandezemeakere].notfemale.DET.PLalso'We will see that there are beings of many kinds, (...), which not
only are neither men nor women, but even neither male nor female'.
[Mitx. EIG VI: 180]
In the preceding example, the headless relative is a complex negative sentence. If the inflected verb were at the end of the relative the example would
be incomprehensible.","[837, 838]"

Syntax4.1. Valency and argument structure in the Basque verb
R. Etxepare
4.1.1. Valency and the auxiliary system: an outline
Leaving aside a small set of verbs (see 3.5.3), Basque finite verbs are composed of a morphologically independent lexical verb carrying aspectual information, and a clitic auxiliary bearing Tense, Agreement and Modal affixes. The choice of auxiliaries in Basque seems to be largely dependent on
the valency of the predicate. Intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive auxiliaries typically correspond to monovalent, bivalent and trivalent predicates.
The arguments of the verb (participants in the event, such as agents, themes
or patients, and beneficiaries) are mapped systematically by person and
number morphology corresponding to grammatical functions such as subject, object and indirect object. Changes in the argument structure of the
verb (as in the causative/inchoative alternation) are also signaled in the
choice of the auxiliary. However, in some cases the correlation between
valency and choice of auxiliary does not obtain. The mismatch between
valency and morphology is due in these cases to the contribution of an aspectual dimension (see section 4.1.1.3).
In order to maintain the two domains clear (lexical structure and morphology), I will refer to the valency of the verb with categories such as
monovalent, bivalent or trivalent, and to its morphological expression with
categories such as intransitive and transitive. The latter are familiar from
the structural analysis of basic verbal paradigms (in section 3.5.3) and are
based on the presence/absence of ergative morphology. When ergative morphology is present in the paradigm corresponding to a finite form, I will refer to that form as transitive. Otherwise, I will refer to that form as intransitive.
In sentences with transitive verbs, the subject is morphologically marked
as ergative and the direct object in the absolutive case (zero suffix). As for
one argument-verbs, Basque expresses morphologically a distinction between tow types of monovalent predicates that has been noted syntactically
in other languages. This is the distinction between unaccusative and unerga-364 Syntaxtive predicates (Perlmutter 1978; Burzio 1981). Subjects of unergative
predicates take the ergative case; subjects of unaccusative predicates, on the
other hand, take the absolutive case. In accord with case marking, unergative predicates take the transitive auxiliary, and unaccusative predicates the
intransitive one:
(499) a. Jonek
Jon.ERGardoaekarri du.wine.DET.(ABS)bring(transitive)AUX'Jon brought the wine.'
b. Jonek
saltatu du.
(unergative)
Jon.ERG jump
AUX
'Jon jumped.'
c. Jon
etorri da.
(unaccusative)
Jon(ABS)comeAUX'Jon came.'
This means that some, but not all, monovalent predicate subjects are marked
like transitive objects. The case marking pattern is of an 'extended' ergative
type (Dixon 1979, 1994; also Levin 1983).
This section (4.1) is structured as follows: in section 4.1.2,1 will discuss
intransitive monovalent structures; in section 4.1.3, intransitive bivalent
structures (predicates with two arguments but no ergative case marking); in
section 4.1.4, transitive structures, and in section 4.1.5, ditransitive ones. In
section 4.1.6 we will turn to possessive constructions and the valencymarking alternations they give rise to. In section 4.1.7, verbs of saying,
thinking and judging and their valency structure are discussed.","[392, 393, 394]"

Once again, the issue seems to be the semantics of the governing verbs, i.e.
whether they accept a meaning whereby the receiver of the command or order or suggestion is not the one who carries it out; but beyond this (apparently lexico-semantic) restriction, the structures headed by -t(z)eko give the
impression of accepting overtly realized subjects.
Nominalized clauses headed by t(z)e + a in subject position (casemarked absolutive and ergative) allow alternations between lexical and
empty subjects; the latter can sometimes be controlled by other arguments
or else be interpreted as an arbitrary third person subject:

"2.3.1.2.1. Main prosodic and pragmatic prominence
Traditional grammarians such as Azkue (1931, 1932) and Al tube (1934) described the word preceding the verb as the most prominent element in a sentence, both prosodically and pragmatically. That is, the word preceding the
verb is perceived by speakers as the most prominent, or 'stronger' than the
rest of the words in the utterance. At the same time, Azkue and Altube identified this word, or the phrase it is contained in, as 'the most important piece
of information' in a sentence. This word or phrase could be the element constituting the answer to the interrogative pronoun in questions such as 'What
happened?' or 'Who gave you the book?', for example. This is illustrated in
the question-answer pairs in examples (4) through (6) below. The most
prominent or focalized constituent appears in boldface:Intonation77(4) Ser
galdu dosu?
what lose AUX
'What have you lost?'
Nire amen
dirud
galdu dot.
my mother.GEN money lose AUX
Ί have lost my mother's money.'
(5) Nor ikusi dosu?

'Who have you seen?'
Arrebien lagunen

(6) Ser
emon dotzu?
what give AUX
'What has (s)he given you?'
Amiimen
liburua emon nau.
grandmother.GEN book
give AUX
'(S)/he has given me my grandmother's book.'
The words or phrases responding to the question words sir 'what' and
nor 'who' are interpreted as the most important part of the sentence informationally, that is, as phrases that provide the necessary information that
fills the gap corresponding to the question word. In pragmatic terms, this
constituent is referred to as new information, rheme, or focus. Azkue and
Altube called this element the 'inquired element', referring to the correspondence between this phrase and a presupposed question, and the position
immediately preceding the verb as the position of the inquired element. The
verb itself may be the most prominent element prosodically and semantically, as we will see below.
But the focus or rheme of an utterance does not have to be triggered by a
question. It might appear in a sentence independently in a discourse, as the
speaker organizes and divides his/her utterances in parts carrying different
informational load: theme and rheme, old and new information, or topic and
focus. Like with answers to questions, the constituent that represents the
rheme, new information or focus of a sentence without being the answer to a
question appears immediately preceding the verb, at least in Northern Bizkaian varieties such as Lekeitio Basque (cf. also 4.4). In other varieties, focalized or new information constituents can appear postverbally within a78Phonologyspeaker's narrative discourse, but they must appear preverbally when they
constitute the answer to a wh-word in a preceding question (cf. section
4.4.8).
It is important to point out that the preverbal constituent is not always interpreted as the most prominent element informationally. A whole sentence
may constitute new information as well, if it is uttered out of the blue or as
an answer to a question such as 'What happened?', and reflects the canonical word order in Basque (S-IO-DO-V). In this case, it is still the word preceding the verb that receives the main prosodic prominence, without any
difference in pitch level or pitch excursion with respect to a sentence in
which the word or phrase preceding the verb constitutes new information.
Thus, if the sentence in (7) were the answer to a question such as 'What
happened?', or were uttered out of the blue, the pitch contour of the utterance would be the same as if the preverbal phrase (i.e., the direct object
madari bat 'a pear') were the focalized constituent. The FO contour is illustrated in Fig. 3.

"4.10.3.1.5. Accessibility
4.10.3.1.5.1. Accessibility hierarchy
When a noun phrase can be relativized in a clause, it is said to be accessible
to relative-clause formation. Most of the time, accessibility to relativization
is understood according to the morphosyntactic features of the relativized
NP, and this is the way we take it here.
Basque is an SOV language which uses a gapping strategy for the relativized phrase. Such languages typically have constraints on accessibility, and
so we expect to find constraints in Basque. It is easy to understand how relativization may appear rather difficult in these circumstances, since the relativized phrase, which includes the case-ending, has no overt realization
within the relative clause. Notice, however, that in those cases where the relativized NP agrees with the verb, verb-agreement can be considered as a
kind of resumptive realization of the relativized phrase. Such a situation can
appear in Basque with ergative, absolutive and dative phrases.
It is generally admitted that accessibility displays the following syntactic
hierarchy (cf. Keenan & Comrie [1977, 1979]:
(1863) subject > direct object > indirect object > adverbial
This hierarchy is the one which is found in Basque, as we will presently
show.
First, let us see how the syntactic hierarchy shown in (1863) could be expressed within the Basque case system:
(1864) absolutive & ergative > dative > subcategorized adverbial > adjunct adverbialSubordination775The hierarchy of (1863) is modified in (1864) because a) no superiority regarding accessibility seems to appear in Basque between subjects and objects, b) subcategorized adverbial phrases are easier to relativize than adjunctive adverbial cases. The interpretation of (1864) is as follows:
- Ergative and absolutive NPs can always be relativized without any kind of
restriction, and no hierarchy seems to exist between them in inflected relatives.
- Dative NPs can be quite easily relativized, but relativization of indirect objects, though possible for all speakers, doesn't seem to be as easy as for subjects and direct objects; for instance, more time is needed for processing this
interpretation in examples out of context. On the contrary, dative NPs associated with psych-verbs are easier to relativize than indirect objects.
- Adverbial cases can be relativized, but accessibility is linked to syntactic
(subcategorization), morphological (morphologically single or complex
cases) and semantic-contextual constraints (when the information carried by
the relative is already known, relativization is easier).
There is no sharp division within the different grades of the hierarchy.
Relativization is possible in all four cases, without difficulties in the first
two cases, with restrictions in the third one. As for the fourth possibility of
(1864), it could be said that NPs taking non-subcategorized morphologically
complex cases resist relativization when there is no case-parallellism (see
below 4.10.3.1.5.4).
In the following sentences we show different kinds of relativization. We
only display examples where the relativized phrase and the whole phrase
have. Relative clauses are bracketed and head-nouns are underlined.
- Relativization of a subject phrase which is ergative:
(1865) Hor dauzkagu(...)

"Notice that clausal arguments of nominal predicates appear postposed in the
neutral order and, thus, the copulative verb intervenes between the nominal
predicate and the clausal argument. In equative constructions the verb also
intervenes between the two members of the equation. This ordering contrasts with the neutral order in predicative and equative constructions with
nominal arguments, in which the verb-final ordering is the most neutral one.",[467]

Some dialects possess overt morphological markers for yes/no questions,
such as G al or eastern (LN, Z, R and Sal), -a; the former is a verbal particle
(3.5.7), while the latter occupies the same position as complementizers
(3.5.7.3). -a is restricted to direct questions, while al may also be found in
embedded contexts:

The last two examples show that verb-fronting may cooccur with the interrogative particle al as well as the yes/no marker -a. As usual, a clause-initial
verb may be preceded in turn by any number of topicalized/scrambled elements and a focalized constituent. Since subjects tend to be topics and objects are often focalized (see Hualde et al.1994), this means that it is not
clear whether SOV sentences like the following exclusively involve interrogative intonation on a neutral word order or whether the object has been
focalized:

Verb-fronting is perhaps more clearly perceived in yes/no questions with
synthetic verbs. These are clitic-like elements which lean on the element to
their left and which cannot therefore occur in absolute initial position in a
main clause. Where verb-fronting to that position takes place, they are supplemented by the particle ba to their left:
(826)Ba al dugu musikan euskal

'Do we have any Basque school in music?' [Mitx. EIG 1:49](827) Baalduzueidazlanikaski?baalhavemanuscript.PRTTenough'Do you have enough manuscripts?' [Mitx. EIG 1:83]
Topics may occur to the left of the initial verb, which will then also appear
with ba- (828); however, this is not the case if a focalized constituent precedes it: that constituent 'counts' as first element to support the synthetic
verb, as in (829):

Verb focalization stands out from the main focalization strategy described
in the preceding sections in that it seems to employ, at least in part, different
mechanisms. Since Altube (1929), a distinction has been drawn between
two types of 'verb focalization': a) cases where the event itself is emphasized, contrasting it with other type of events, and b) cases where 'the positive or negative quality of the verb is emphasized', i.e. where what is emphasized is that the action or state did take place or is true, as opposed to not
taking place or not being true. A priori, the contrastive overtones of the former seem more akin to the types of constituent focalization discussed in
section 4.4.2, while positive verbal emphasis falls fully in line with the
yes/no questions discussed in 4.4.3.1 However, both types of verb focaliza-470 Syntaxtion will be discussed in this section in order to prevent dispersion and to
facilitate a sharper distinction between the two. Contrastive event focalization will be dealt with in 4.4.3.2.1, and 4.4.3.2.2 will be devoted to polar
emphasis. Since negation presents additional problems which will be examined in section 4.4.7 below, we will concentrate here on positive polar emphasis.","[497, 498, 499, 500]"
"2.3.1.2.1.1. Restrictions on the assignment of main prominence
The most prominent accent in a sentence has to be on one of the words in
the preverbal syntactic phrase. An accented syllable in a phrase that is not
left-adjacent to the verb cannot be the most prominent one in the utterance.
This is exemplified by the ungrammaticality of an utterance such as (16),
where main prominence is given to a word contained in a syntactic phrase
that is not immediately preceding the verb. That is, instead of the direct object liburua 'the book' having main prominence, it is the subject maixuak
'the teacher' that is assigned main prominence. The word with main prominence is written in boldface:84Phonology(16) * Maixuak
liburua ekarri dau.
teacher.ERG book
bring AUX
'The teacher has brought the book.'
The corresponding grammatical sentence would be (17a), where the object liburua has main prominence or (17b), with maixuak in preverbal position:
(17) a. Maixuak liburüa ekarri dau.
b. Liburua maixuak ekarri dau.
On the other hand, as we said above in section 2.3.1.1, only an unaccented word immediately preceding the verb displays prominence on its final syllable. A lexically unaccented word that is not left-adjacent to the verb
cannot have prominence, regardless of whether it is contained in the phrase
preceding the verb or not. Thus, a sentence such as (18), pronounced with an
accent in the first word, is ungrammatical. The word gixonak is the subject,
and is therefore in a separate syntactic phrase from the preverbal word, the
object biarra. Its correct version would be one of the sentences in (19):
(18) * Gixonak biarra topa dau.
man.ERG job
find
AUX
""The man has found a job.'
(19) a. Gixonak biarrd topa dau.
b. Biarra gixonak topa dau / gixonäk topa dau biarra.
The only exception to this pattern would be cases of multiple foci, where
the sentence is uttered as a response to a question with two inquired elements. For instance, to a question such as (20) one could respond as in (21),
with the two words in different phrases having almost the same kind of
prominence. It is important to point out that the first word, i.e., the subject
Aitorrek is lexically unaccented but receives an accent in these circumstances:

The interesting point is that the complementizer for these subjunctive
clauses can be either -ela or -en in some cases; but the occurrence of -ela
seems to be more frequent in the western dialects, where a sentence like
(1466) would usually have daitezela rather than daitezen. According to
Goenaga (1997), the tendency in the Basque literary tradition has been for
the verbs nahi and behar, as well as for the predicate adjectives, to prefer
subjunctive clauses headed by -en, while the rest of the verbs would choose
either complementizer. Nonetheless, the authors of this grammar find that
some speakers of the southern/western dialects accept the complementizer
-ela even in sentences like (1464). One example of this:

Ί ordered to teach classes at the Leioa campus.'
In the case of agindu, the translations and the glosses make it clear that the
dual subcategorization goes hand in hand with a change in interpretation:
agindu requires a nominalized clause case-marked with absolutive if the intended meaning is roughly 'promise'; it selects a -t(z)eko complement when
it has a command interpretation ('order'). As for eskatu, the difference is
harder to grasp: when it takes a plain nominalization, it is roughly equivalent to request or ask for (a particular choice), and it is usually a subjectcontrol verb: in the example at hand, the subject of the nominalization is
null and interpreted as coreferential with the subject of the main clause. If
the -t(z)eko complement is selected, then the interpretation is similar to demand, and there may or may not be control: in (1558b) above, the subject of
emateko can be an arbitrary third person or eskolak 'classes' itself (in the
latter case, the entire constituent is interpreted as an impersonal sentence);
but, if there is control, it will be object control:674 Syntax(1559) a. Eskolak
classesLeioakocampuseanemateaLeioa.RELcampus.LOCgive.ΝΟΜ.DETeskatudit.askAUX.3A/1D/3E'S/he requested ('to me') teaching the classes at the Leioa campus.'

demand AUX
'S/he asked me to teach the classes at the Leioa campus.'
Roughly speaking, in the examples above, where there is dative agreement
with the first person (-£- in dit), the person making the request would be the
teacher in example (a), but the first person singular would be the teacher in
(b). Similarly, a verb like esan 'say' introduces a report if it takes a -t(z)e+a
complement (marked absolutive) and a command (as in English tell with infinitives) with -t(z)eko complements. In other words, there truly seems to be
no free variation between the two complement types, and the choice usually
goes hand in hand with a difference in syntactic behavior and interpretation.
The difference, however, may be blurred if there is no dative argument present.4.10.1.2.2.2. -t(z)en complements
This is one of the most common forms of non-finite complementation in
Basque; it is a combination of the verbal noun followed by the locative suffix -n without the presence of the morpheme -a. In this regard, we should
note that regular nominalized clauses bearing the locative case-ending and
what we will neutrally call -t(z)en complements do not share the same distribution in most dialects; in contexts where locative nominalized clauses
are possible, -t(z)en complements are excluded, and viceversa:

"4.10.3.4.1.3. Word-order within the relative
The position of the relative pronoun at the beginning of the relative clause is
obligatory, but the verb can appear in any position within the relative
clause. In (1963) above the verb follows the relative pronoun. In the example below, it occurs at the end of the relative clause, preceded by the direct
object (Frantzia), and an adjunct clause:
(1964)...gizonbat, Napoleon,[zeinak,manonewhich.DET.ERGNapoleongobernamenduarifidelitatezkogovernment.DATloyalty.LNSTR.RELjuramentua

Relative pronouns that belong to a complement or an adjunct clause within
the relative cannot be extracted from them. Therefore, in relative structures
the whole phrase or clause containing the relative pronoun has to be moved
along with the relative pronoun to the beginning of the sentence. The following examples illustrate pied-piping in this context (see 4.4.5.3):

from different clauses (nork/zer and nork/nori zer), similar to the break usually observed with topics. We mark this break with a slash sign in the following examples. With two wh-words, any order may be acceptable. Where
more than two wh-words meet, the wh-words coming from the lower clause
may be placed as a group before or after the matrix wh-word; in no case canFocalization 501they be interspersed. Notice that in the examples with iruditu 'seem' the dative argument is interpreted as belonging to this psychological verb, rather
than to the lower verb esan 'say', as made clear by the absence of a dative
marker in the latter's auxiliary:

These -t(z)eko non-finite constituents may optionally take the partitive determiner in the same contexts that a regular noun phrases does: if the governing verb is negated, if it is part of a yes-no question, or if it is embeded in
a conditional sentence (c-d, from Arejita 1984:108, in Bizkaian):672 Syntax(1554) a.","[701, 702]"

Leaving aside the issue of the semantics of debekatu (Goenaga suggests that
it might mean not only 'forbid' but 'transmit a prohibition to somebody';
similar considerations apply to proposatu), it looks like, despite the phenomenon of control, nominalized clauses headed by -t(z)e + a do accept
lexical subjects, especially emphatic pronouns.
Command/order verbs that select -t(z)eko complements usually have an
empty subject controlled by the dative, but this is not a must, at least with
esan:

In the (a) example Amaia will be most likely interpreted as the subject of
etorri, but some other person could also be the subject in an appropriate
context. The situation is more doubtful with other verbs, such as agindu 'order', eskatu 'ask' and erregutu 'beg, urge' but examples can be found:

"4.8.2. Causee marking in morphological causatives
This section is devoted to causee marking in morphological causatives,
where the logical subject caused to act may not occur as a subject. This
grammatical function is taken over by the causer, which, if expressed, will
appear in the ergative case. The causee, on the other hand, will take on absolutive or dative marking. The dialectal and argumental factors which rule
the usage of one case marking versus the other are discussed in the following sections. We will examine the case marking of the causee ('logical subject') of intransitive, monotransitive and ditransitive predicates. In order to
make case marking patterns in the examples more illustrative, pronouns are
provided in cases where the nominal would have been dropped in actual
use. These pronouns are inserted in square brackets in corpus examples and
in parentheses in constructed examples.",[626]

AUX4.10.3.1.3. Modifier and relative stacking
All kinds of noun modifiers can be used on a par with relatives: genitive
phrases, adnominal adverbial phrases, adjectives, quantifiers, etc. Usually,
prenominal relatives appear as the leftmost constituent, and postnominal
relatives as the rightmost lexical phrases within the relative. Hence,
prenominal relative clauses generally precede other adnominal phrases as in
(1853) below:768Syntax(1853) Jendeaere gutiagoakitukozenpeopletootire.FUTAUXbalitzjarririk[plazarensahetsetandiren]if.AUXsit.PTCPsquare.GENsides.LOCare.coMPharrizkoalkietan.stone.lNSTR.RELbenches.LOCless(...)egon
stay'People too would have been less tired, if they had been sitting on
the stone benches which are on both sides of the square.'
[Etch. 5wr.:108]
In (1853) there is an adverbial adnominal phrase (harrizko 'of stone') between the relative clause and the head noun.
In postnominal relatives the relative clause usually follows adjectives as
(1851) above. But the reverse order, although marked, can be found:
(1854) a.","[797, 798]"
"4.4.6.3.1.2. Multiple clausemate wh-words
As for wh-words, we have already mentioned in the introduction to this
chapter that, very occasionally, several wh-words may coexist preverbally
in the same clause:
(971) Etazureprestutasunazandyourvirtue.on... norkzererranendu?whatsay.FUTAUXwho.ERG'And about your virtue, who will say what?' [Ax. 2]
In such cases, as with multiple foci, the wh-words involved must occur in
the neutral order, so that the sequence zer nork in the previous sentence
would not be acceptable. Moreover, no other non-interrogative element may
intervene between the wh-words:
(972)*NorkhorretazJberazlJonizererranenwho.ERGthat.on/therefore/Jon.DATwhatsay.FUT AUXdio?",[529]
"508 SyntaxThis position is also marked by emphatic intonation; an element thus emphasized will then occur immediately to the left of the tenseless verbal form.
Thus, contrast the first two sentences above with the following ones, where
another constituent intervenes between the emphasized element and the participle:
(1015)ΊΊΕζ du ESKAERA Jonek sinatu(1016)ΊΊΕζ nien lAGUNEI horregatik arrapostuHowever, the post-verbal focus in non-pre-participial position is acceptable
provided it appears in the position it would occupy in a 'neutral' word order:
(1017) Ez du JONEK eskaerasinatu.","[537, 538]"
"2.3.3.2. Intonational division of an utterance
One important word-order feature that distinguishes the variety of Baztan
from the varieties of Tolosa and Lekeitio is that main prosodic prominence
can appear postverbally more frequently in Baztan than in the other two varieties. When the whole utterance is new information, not only in narratives
but also as an answer to a question such as 'What happened?\ the constituent with the most prominent pitch accent appears postverbally. Thus, an answer to the question 'What happened?' could be the one in (57):Intonation109(57) Mirenek
gan du
liburüe.
Miren.ERG take AUX book
'Miren has taken the book.'
This sentence could also be uttered within a narrative discourse, where the
direct object liburüe 'the book' is focalized or constitutes new information.
The intonational pattern of Baztan Basque is very similar to the one described for the dialect of Tolosa (although the position of the accented syllable within the word is different). All constituents preceding the one carrying
main prosodic prominence end in a rising intonation (that is, they have a
peak on the final syllable, i.e., the post-tonic). The phrase or constituent
with main prosodic prominence is identified not by its position, but by being
the phrase containing the only word with a fall in pitch after the accented
syllable and by being in the portion of the utterance with a lower pitch level
or pitch range.
In instances of preverbal focalization, the portion of the utterance following the focalized constituent has a much more reduced pitch range than the
preceding portion of the utterance, and it is this feature that triggers the perception of main prominence. In fact, even the stress on the auxiliary observable in (57) is absent in preverbal focalization instances such as the one in
(58) (cf. Fig. 29):
(58) Liburüe gan du
Mirenek.

Figure 29.","[138, 139]"
"In this case there is a subtle difference in intonation that forces the subjunctive complement in (1101b) to be uttered as a dislocated phrase, represented
here by a comma at the end of the complement. In fact, the subjunctive
complement is not easily sandwiched in a matrix negative structure with
that order, as shown in (1102):
(1102) a. Eznion[gehiago etorezzedin]agindu.not AUX more
come not AUX
ordered
Ί didn't ordered him/her not to come anymore.'b. ΊΕζ nion
notAUX[ez zedingehiagoetor]agindu.notmorecomeorderedAUXThe position of the dependent clause in (1102) corresponds to de Rijk's
(1996b) 'quasi-focus' position (see 4.4.7.2.1). The subjunctive complement,
with preposed negation+auxiliary, can precede the matrix negative, as a
topic:
(1103) Ez zedin gehiago etor, ez nion agindu.",[556]
"2.3.2.2. Restrictions on the assignment of main prosodic prominence
As in all dialects of Basque, in Tolosa only a word contained in the syntactic
phrase immediately preceding the verb may receive main prosodic prominence. In sentences such as (52), with three syntactic phrases before the verb
(i.e., the subject amonak 'grandma', the indirect object αηάίαί 'to [my]
brother', and the direct object ogi-mamia 'bread-crumb'), it is the word in
the phrase that is left-adjacent to the verb that is most prominent intonationally. This is the direct object ogi-mamiya. It would not be acceptable to provide main intonational prominence to any word in any phrase other than the
direct object:
(52) Amonak
anäiai
ogi-mamiya eman dio.
grandma.ERG brother.DAT bread-crumb give AUX
'Grandma has given a bread-crumb to (my, her, our) brother.' /
'It has been a bread-crumb that grandma has given to (my, her, our)
brother.'
In Tolosa all words in the phrase immediately preceding the verb can be
focalized, given the absence of unaccented words in this variety.",[133]

Word order may be used in the previous situation to clarify a potentially
ambiguous sentence, in which case dative doubling will be acceptable. The
following sentence is given as an acceptable example of ditransitive causativization in Hualde et al. (1994:176):

unemployment.in/home.inhave.3A/2E'Jon feels bad/is shouting/is with Miren/is unemployed/is at

Nevertheless, dyadic auxiliary verbs both of the ergative/absolutive or absolutive/dative type often instantiate arguments of the nominal predicate, as in
(700). Constructions bearing true arguments contrast with allocutives in
(699) because they lack person restrictions:
(700) a. Zapata horiek handiak ditu

'Jon needs money in order to carry out the project.' (lit.'Money is

Different kinds of (auxiliary) verbs appear with participles depending on the
number of arguments, as in the following example. Note that with the auxiliary edun 'have' in (701b), two different readings are obtained: a predicative
reading and an active perfective one:Nominal Predication 431(701) a.","[460, 461]"
"'Who will say what to Jon/therefore/on that?'

(974) Zer ekarri du nork?

cumbersome, we have included detailed morpheme-to-morpheme information only of morphological material directly relevant to each section. Where
the shape or order of the morpheme is important, it has been isolated using
hyphens both on the Basque sentence and on the glosses. Otherwise, the
morphemes involved have been identified only on the glosses, separating
them with dots. Dots are also used for cases where several morphemes in
English correspond to the Basque morpheme/word. As usual, lexical items
have been written in normal font, while grammatical morphemes have been
written on small capital characters. Grammatical morphemes difficult to
gloss (such as ba, ote, etc.) are simply given as such in the glosses in italics;
they are included as entries in the index tables at the end of the Grammar.
Full sentences are indicated by capital initials and sentence final period
marks (some quotations are adjusted to this usage if they make up full sentences). Phrases and incomplete or subordinate clauses begin with lower
case characters and are not followed by a period. Example sources are indicated in square brackets. A separate section in the References identifies the
abbreviations used for them.
Nominal inflection
Case endings are glossed with the name of the case, without trying to analyze them further into determiner, number and case ending proper. This information is easily retrievable from the inflection charts offered in chapter
3.2. For reading ease, the gloss for a case is often not the morphological
case label, but its meaning ('with' for coM(itative), etc.). Among grammatical cases, dative is glossed in exactly the same way (DAT or 'to'), and ergative always with the case label (ERG). The zero case, absolutive, is treated
somewhat differently. We have taken it as the default case, so that, unless
otherwise stated, the absence of any case indication on a nominal means it is
in the absolutive case.
Determiners and plural markers are not easily isolatable for most case
endings and we have not tried to identify them in the glosses. Thus,
gizonekin comitative plural is glossed as 'men.with', or 'men.COM', while
the comitative singular gizonarekin is glossed as 'man.with' or 'man.COM'.
The determiner (-a) and the plural marker (-it) are most easily identifiable in
the absolutive case, but here too, we have only identified them where di-viii Notes on glossesrectly relevant. Thus, a noun like etxeak '(the) houses' has been glossed in
full (house.DET.PL) only where the information is important. Otherwise it is
glossed as 'houses'. Similarly, singular etxea is usually glossed as 'house'
and only where needed as 'house.DET'. Nonetheless, both determiner and
plural are identified when they are attached to anything other than a noun
(to adjectives, headless relatives, etc.): etxe handia is always glossed as
'house big.DET\ etxekoak 'house.REL.DET.PL', etc. The Basque texts in section 5 have been glossed with more details. There all case endings have
been separated from the stem and identified, and the latter has always been
glossed in the singular. The case endings thus identified can be easily
checked in the tables provided in section 3.2. As usual, determiners and plural markers have only been identified for the zero case, the absolutive.
Verb glosses
Verbal inflection in finite verbal forms is also glossed in detail only where
directly relevant. Since the only relevant information, outside the chapter on
verbal morphology itself, is person agreement (including person, case and
number morphemes) only that information is specified. Unless PL 'plural' in
explicitly marked, 'singular' is the default value. We have tried to represent
person agreement information in the order in which it appears on the verb.
Thus, subjects will be variously marked to the right or to the left, depending
on whether they are cross-referenced by the ergative or the absolutive
marker. Person morphemes are separated by slashes from each other in
pluripersonal agreement forms. Mood is only marked when the potential or
hypothetical marker -ke is present or when the subjunctive auxiliary is selected, if directly relevant. Where none of this is relevant, only 'AUX' has
been indicated. Full information is given in 3.5.2.
As for aspect information, following Basque grammatical tradition, we
gloss perfective participles as infinitives. This is so because they work as
the unmarked, citation form of the verb. Thus, a form like hartu is glossed
as 'take'. Similarly, the future morpheme -ko is added to this citation, participial form, and we gloss hartuko as take.FUT, disregarding again the 'perfective' aspect marker -tu-. The auxiliary izan 'be' reinforcing perfective
tenses (3.5.4.2.1) or inserted to provide a verbal host for aspectual markers
in verbal locutions (3.5.4.2.2) is always glossed as 'be' regardless of its
grammatical function.
The perfective present form ikusi dut can be translated as a present perfect of simple past in English. Both translations are given for this tense
throughout the grammar. The different tense values are described in 3.5.4.
Finally, some verbal expressions can be analyzed as regular verb+auxiliaryNotes on glosses ixcombinations or as noun/adjective + 'be, have' periphrases: bizi naiz Ί live,
be alive', nahi dut Ί want, have desire'. We have maintained the different
authors' preferences in this area.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

haveThe two alternates have slightly different interpretations though, as we can
see from the glosses. Whereas 'intransitive' (a) admits an interpretation
where the subject is not referential, 'transitive' (b) doesn't:
(651) Nork deitzen du?
Beren anaia
da /
who call
AUX.TR their
brother is /
ΊΊΑηαία dute.
brother they.have
'Who's calling? It is their brother/??He is their brother.'
Noun-phrase-internal possessions typically express a wider range of relations than noun-phrase-external ones. In order for the noun-phrase-external
transitive possession to be admissible, it must be either of the inalienable
kind or pertain to something like the 'personal sphere'. The personal sphere
includes, besides affective notions such as friend or family (652), professional relations (653), and familiar objects (654). Part/whole relations are
also accessible through this construction (655). Possessive relations that fail
to express any of those relations are inadmissible in an external possession
structure (656)-(657):

Jon's brother is
'He/it is Jon's brother.'

Similarly, some clauses hardly ever function as foci and tend to occur to the
right of the clause. This is the case, for instance, of eta, ze, bait causal
clauses (4.10.2.2.1.5) as opposed to -lako clauses (4.10.2.2.1.1.3).
Discourse considerations, however, may override heaviness, so that those
clause types whose discourse function is typically thematic tend to appear as
topics in the left periphery of the clause. This is the case of conditional and
concessive clauses (Zabala 2000):
