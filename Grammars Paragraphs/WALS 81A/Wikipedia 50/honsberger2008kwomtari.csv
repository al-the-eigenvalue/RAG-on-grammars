Kwomtari grammar shows many features typical of Papuan languages or of the
Sepik region. Core noun phrases take nominative-accusative agreement, and
constituent order is SOV. Subject and object are cross-referenced by verbal suffixes,
which contradicts statements made by Laycock (1973, 1975) and Wurm (1982:246).
Subjects lack case marking, while objects of transitive verbs take the same case
marking as recipients of ditransitive verbs. This case marking system is common in
the Sepik-Ramu region (Foley 2005:134), although Kwomtari lacks the distinction
between animate and inanimate objects found in other languages. Complex actions
are expressed by a generic verb preceded by an adjunct noun. Sentences are formed
from chains of medial clauses terminating in an independent clause.
Other features of Kwomtari grammar are more distinctive. Kwomtari appears to
be the first attested example of a Papuan language with a quinary case system for
oblique nominals (cf Foley 1986:101): location, goal of movement, source of
movement, instrument and cause all have distinct postpositions. Kwomtari lacks
gender or other classifiers, despite being surrounded by languages with one or more
noun classification systems. Medial verbs lack switch-reference marking, while
independent verbs are inflected for status (mood) and aspect, but not tense. Pronouns
are only distinguished for number with first and second person subjects; in other
syntactic roles and in third person, number distinctions are neutralised. Marking of
pragmatic focus is central to the grammatical system.","[23, 24]"
"Kwomtari Grammar Essentialsby Katharine Spencer1. Introduction
Kwomtari is a Papuan language, spoken by people in six villages in the Sandaun
Province of Papua New Guinea, close to the border of Indonesia. These six villages
are divided into three dialect groups, with higher than 94% lexical similarity between
dialects. This paper is based on data collected from the dialect of Baifeni village. The
people of Baifeni call their language ‘Glefe’, from the word for ‘why’.
The corpus of data used in this analysis was collected mainly by Murray and
Carol Honsberger, between 1989 and 1998. In 1998, I and my colleague Julia Drew
were privileged to live and work with them among the people of Baifeni for nine
weeks, from early February to mid April. Working with the Summer Institute of
Linguistics under their ‘Graduate International Programme’ (GRIP), most of this time
was spent collecting more language data, Julia concentrating more on phonological
data and I on the grammar. Tomas Didiki and Yesefe Sukwari have been the principal
language advisors since 1989, but we were also advised by Dikson Gumute, Robert
Kosme and Lukas Dimeni (as well as numerous other villagers) during our nine-week
stay.
The data consists mainly of texts written by Kwomtari speakers during two
‘writers’ workshops’ – the first run by Frans Zandstra at Amanab and the second in
Baifeni village by Murray Honsberger, with men from each of the villages. Other
texts were collected on cassettes and transcribed by Murray. Only a few texts from
dialects other than Baifeni have been worked on, and then only after they were
adapted to Baifeni dialect. Also included is data elicited from language helpers. Texts
are presented in this paper using the practical orthography recommended in the
accompanying phonology paper by Julia Drew; additionally, the underlying
morphemes are shown, not the surface forms after the application of any
morphophonemic changes.
Kwomtari is an SOV language, while the order of suffixation on the verb is VOS.
There is no switch-reference system – participants in discourse are tracked by subject
marking on each clause. Kwomtari uses postpositions; the normal order in the noun
phrase is demonstrative, noun, adjective. Kwomtari has many two-phoneme particles,54Grammar Essentials55a number of which are homophonous. Kwomtari has a focus marker particle te which
is the base for demonstratives and conjunctions.
Thanks are due to Murray and Carol Honsberger and their children who
welcomed me warmly into their language programme; also to the people of Baifeni
village, especially the men mentioned above who gave much time to help me grasp
the grammar of their language. Thanks are also due to all those in England who have
supported me and enabled me to spend this time in Papua New Guinea, and to John
Roberts and others who were involved in the training for GRIP. Also to Julia and my
other friends here who have been a great encouragement. Special thanks are due to
Cindi Farr who has worked hard to help me analyse the more complicated parts of
this grammar and has suggested improvements to the paper.","[62, 63, 64, 65]"

‘The ones that eat this tree and then put their baby grubs there, we call
afuki, it’s the same as the beetle which aidu metamorphoses into. This
tree - its leaves are dead and those beetles smell it…’2.5 Noun phrases
The only obligatory part of the noun phrase is the head noun. The order around
the head noun is as follows. The demonstrative precedes the head unless there is a
possessor. If there is a possessor, the demonstrative immediately follows the head.
Adjectives have been discussed in §2.1.3 – they are usually positioned before the
noun for animate nouns (and also na ‘word’ and ami ‘way’), and after the noun for all
others. Noun phrases are almost always seen with a final -lu marking.
Default order in the noun phrase:
(Demonstrative)
HEAD (Qualifier) (Quantifier)
When there is a possessor the order changes:
(Possessor) HEAD (Demonstrative)
(Qualifier) (Quantifier)
Default order in the noun phrase for animate nouns:
(Demonstrative)
(Qualifier) HEAD (Quantifier)2.5.1 Coordinating noun phrases
The only conjoiner is the comitative postposition -tu (see §3.2.2), otherwise noun
phrases are simply juxtaposed in a list. The suffix -pe (discussed in §3.1.6) is used
within noun phrases to create a disjoint relationship, and mwa ‘no’ is used to deny the
presence of a noun within a noun phrase.","[84, 85]"
"16911. Residue
Some grammatical features of the languages were not able to be resolved in this
research. Following are some unsolved issues.
a. The suffix -lu
A clear meaning covering all uses of -lu is yet to be found. There are some uses
of -lu which are difficult to account for. Linked with this is the problem of defining
adjectives. It may be possible to form a separate class of adjectives, though I suspect
not. The order within the noun phrase depends on this and is not completely clear.
Use of -lu on clauses needs further investigation. Also, it is not clear why, when the
locative postposition is suffixed to a human entity, -lu must occur between the noun
and the locative postposition.
b. The status of the nominals used in compound verbs
The status of the nominals used in conjunction with the verb le is in question. Are
they actually verbal compounds (incorporations) or are they verb phrases? They
usually are tightly knit together, but other words like feti can sometimes intervene
between the nominal and the derivational verb.
c. Motion suffixes on the verb
It is not clear what functions the te and fe parts of these suffixes play. It is not
clear under what circumstances the suffixes based on te are used in preference to
those based on fe. The distinction may be linked to transitivity. Since one of these
motion suffixes has a second aspectual meaning, others may also display aspectual
meaning.
d. Irrealis status
The uses of irrealis status have not been completely sorted out yet. It is used for
all future events, whatever their certainty. It is also used to mark an ability on the part
of someone to do something. Whether irrealis status can be used for contrafactual
constructions is unknown, because they do not exist in the current data corpus. This
sort of construction will need to be found.","[179, 180]"
"7. Clauses
7.1 Clause structure
7.1.1 Basic clause structure
Every clause must necessarily contain a predicate. Though the vast majority of
predicates involve a verb, there are some that do not. A clause may have an overt
noun phrase subject, which would then precede the verb.
Clause = (Subject) Predicate
Kwomtari has nominative-accusative agreement of both noun phrases and verbal
person markers. The general order in the clause is SOV. Example (1) illustrates this
basic clause order:
(1) Klifu gwaie-le
pie-fo-lee.
dog cassowary-GL bay-3S.O-3S.R
‘The dog bayed at the cassowary.’
However, in all verbal clauses the number and person of the subject, and
generally the goal, if present, are marked on the verb by suffixation. This often leads
to deletion of subject noun phrases (2), goal noun phrases (3), or both (4):
(2) Wokoo-i-le
ri-ie.
village-LOC-GL come-1S.R
‘I came to the village.’
(3) Lufwa fie-fo-ne,
“Marena pe?”
man
ask-3S.O-3P.R true
POSB
‘The men asked him, “Is it true?”’
(4) Bule-i
purele-lu-ke…
basket-LOC put.in-2S.R-SEQ
‘You put them in the basket, and…’147148Kwomtari Grammar7.1.2 Non-verbal predicates
Equative predicates are usually non-verbal The verb le ‘do’ can optionally be
used (see §7.1.3 below). Mwa ‘no’ can itself be a predicate.
(5) Nelene wofri feti le-fo-lee,
mene mwa.
Nelen fear very do-3S.O-3S.R, 1NPL no
‘Nelen’s really afraid of him, I’m not.’
(6) Mene klifu wolu.
1NPL dog already
‘I have a dog.’
(7) Mene klifu mwa.
1NPL dog no
‘I don’t have a dog.’7.1.3 Descriptive clauses
Descriptive clauses have two primary components: an optional subject and an
obligatory predicate. The predicate contains a complement conveying a noun
characteristic and, usually optionally, the verb le ‘do’. If le is present it rarely has
more than subject/status marking.
(8) Eete-geni ite
selilu mena-nu (le-lee).
here-thing house big
1.PN-NN (do-3S.R)
‘This big house is mine.’
(9) Nebulu ari
feti le-lu-aga!
bad
child very do-2S.R-EXC
‘You are a very bad child!’
(10) Fwi
wamolu (le-lee).
coconut long
do-3S.R
‘The coconut (palm) is tall.’
(11) Mene tukilu auteli.
1NPL small girl
‘I’m a little girl.’
(12) Une kwoneblu auteli le-lu.
girl
do-2S.R
2NPL white
‘You’re a white girl.’Kwomtari Grammar149When a non-permanent characteristic is attributed to an entity, the predicate is
sometimes marked with durative aspect to specify the time period during which the
entity demonstrated the characteristic. This is illustrated in (13):
(13) Sospan
nigi le-la-lee.
saucepan hot do-P.DUR-3S.R
‘The saucepan is hot.’
When adjectives occur in the predicate, they can optionally be stripped of their
-lu ending:
(14) Ka ri-lu
wi le-lee.
tree body-NN red do-3S.R
‘The tree’s body is red.’
(15) Mene tukilu le-ie.
1NPL small do-1S.R
‘I am small.’7.1.4 Comparisons
There are no comparative or superlative adjectival forms. Comparisons are made
with the verb le ‘do’, preceded by an adjective giving the quality in question. The
entity being compared is the subject of the verb, while the standard of comparison is
positioned and marked as the goal. Examples (16) and (17) show the comparative
construction:
mena-nu klifu-le.
(16) Una-nu klifu seli-me feti le-fo-lee
2.PN-NN dog big-CER very do-3S.O-3S.R 1.PN-NN dog-GL
‘Your dog is bigger than mine.’ (Lit. ‘Your dog does very big to my

(17) Mena-nu ri

1.PN-NN skin 2.PN-NN skin-GL black do-1/2S.O-3S.R
‘My skin is blacker than yours.’ (Lit. ‘My skin does black to your skin.’)
The particle keme ‘resemblance’ is used to state resemblance. Here, the item
compared is the subject of the predicate, which contains the standard of comparison,
followed by keme and the verb le ‘do’ (see §6.1.5).
le-be.
(18) Fife-lu
... maie ai-lu
keme
excrement-NN … egg hut-NN resemblance do-3S.IR

keme
le-lu.
2NPL 2.PN-NN father.1/2 resemblance do-2S.R
‘You’re like your father.’
The word keme does not specify the particulars of the resemblance. These must
be gained from context. In example (19), the speaker could be referring to physical
appearance or to character.
It is possible to be more specific, for example:
(20) Klifu are mwamole ri-lu-me
le-ne.
dog two one
body-NN-CER do-1/3P.R
‘The two dogs are the same (size, colour).’ (Lit. ‘have one body’)
Another word, atuke, has similar usage to keme. My hypothesis is that atuke
implies exact similarity (identicality), and keme merely resemblance. Atuke occurs
only in these descriptive clauses.
(21) Pike-tu
ueiau-tu
mwamole ri
atuke

do-1/3S.R
‘The white cockatoo and the black cockatoo have the same body.’7.2 Negated clause
The predicate may be negated by the adverb glei, which is positioned first in the
predicate:1

glei menegu-fe a-be.
Nuboue
FOC thus-do-3S.O-3S.R NEG breath-RSN do-3S.IR good

well.’
Example (23) shows glei negating a non-verbal predicate:
(23) Mene glei tomulu lufwa.
man
1NPL NEG new
‘I’m not a new (inexperienced) man.’
1Refer to earlier discussion of glei in §5.3.2.","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"

Compare examples (102) and (103) below; the final verbs in both sentences have
irrealis status. In (102), the suffix -i is used to mark that shooting bats is a condition
for cooking them, gathering and eating them. In (103), which uses -ke, the shooting of
bats is presumed, and the cooking, gathering and eating will surely follow.

b. Subordinating Suffix
The function of -lu in relativising clauses is discussed in §7.3. Example (104)
below illustrates its use.

(105) Mena-nu mie glei fo-la-ne-i.
1.PN-NN sago NEG eat-P.DUR-1/3P.R-NEG
‘They (pigs) aren’t eating my sago.’4.3 Verb phrase
The verb phrase has the following constituents: (a) pre-verbal negator; (b) noun
modifiers to the verb, i.e. noun phrases that are intrinsically part of the verb, forming
nominal + verb compounds or tightly knit units; (c) core arguments of the verb (actor,
goals); and (d) oblique arguments of the verb (e.g. reason, location, instrument). The
verb phrase may constitute the entire clause (even sentential utterance).
Order within the verb phrase is relatively free, with the exception that the verb
occurs last. Some orders are slightly more common and suggest the following as the
default ordering:
(NEG) (GL PP) (RSN PP) (LOC PP) (COM PP) (Manner Adv) (Deictic Adv) V
When the pre-verbal negator glei is present, it obligatorily intervenes between the
subject and the verb. This provides evidence for the existence of a verb phrase at a
separate level from the clause. Example (106) illustrates the obligatory ordering of
glei within the verb phrase:
(106) Eete-geni lufwa glei Aie
Gote-le arie
nuboue
here-thing man NEG father.1/2 God-GL stomach good
le-fo-lee.
do-3S.O-3S.R
‘This man didn’t love father God.’
Examples (107) - (109) show the relative ordering of goals and instrument/
comitative PPs in the verb phrase:
(107) Mene fori silu yesine i-tu
prafe-ie.
1NPL pig baby torch fire-COM shoot.S-1S.R

Kwomtari has adverbs encoding the manner in which an event is performed,
general and specific temporal adverbs, negating adverbs, deictic adverbs, locational
adverbs and modal adverbs. This chapter describes first adverbs of manner (§5.1),
then temporal adverbs (§5.2), negators (§5.3), deictic adverbs (§5.4), locative adverbs
(§5.5) and finally modal adverbs (§5.6).","[132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"

Whereas in a complex sentence the order of events is specified, the adverb eese
(see §5.4) is sometimes used in a simpler coordinate sentence in order to be less
specific. Clauses are simply juxtaposed, then a form of the verb ‘do’ (-le or -a) is used
with the adverb eese, which generically recapitulates the events of the previous
clauses.

Kwomtari has two verbs which can introduce a quotation. The most common is
ne ‘say’, which is used for both direct and indirect quotations. In all cases where ne isKwomtari Grammar157used, it is given appropriate subject/status and object suffixes, which indicates the
independent nature of the clause and the coordinate nature of the sentence. This verb
has the form ne when occurring without an addressee, and na when an addressee is
stated: in this case the addressee is always referenced with object marking on the
verb. Examples (19) - (21) below illustrate this point; in (19) and (20) no addressee is
specified, but there is an explicit addressee in (21).

1NPL see-1S.IR
‘He said to brother Agai, “OK, give it to me, first I want to see.”’
Direct quotations are almost always preceded by ne, as in (21) above; sometimes
the object noun phrase occurs between the verb and the quote. Some quotations have
ne both preceding and following, as in example (22) below. The second instance of ne
can be interpreted as tail-head linkage, i.e. the beginning of the following clause
recapitulating the substance of the preceding clause. The adverb eese ‘thus’ may
occur with ne either preceding or following the quotation:158Kwomtari Grammar(22) Na-te-ie,

‘I said to them, “Libu, he told us to hurry, then we tracked it.” I was
saying (this) to them, and …’
Only short quotations may occur with ne following rather than preceding. One
example appears in (23):

who shoot.S-3S.R-EXC say-1/2S.O-1/3P.R
‘… I gave (some) to a clan and they asked me, “Who shot the pig?”’
The other quotative verb is fie ‘ask’. Fie always precedes the quotation, as in (24)
and (25) below. The verb ne ‘say’ can also be used when a question is asked, rather
than fie.
“Fori akei-e?”
(24) Fie-fo-ie,

FOC Casper

‘And Casper asked them, “Why did you (pl) flee?”’
In continuous speech, quotations may not be separately marked; the hearer is
expected to keep track of the participants. Indirect quotations of speech or thought are
formed with ne ‘say’; ne follows the indirect quotation. These are formed like direct
quotes, but 1st person irrealis markers are used on quoted verbs. This use of the
morpheme -fe displays a link between its two meanings of reason and 1st singular
irrealis. Here, as well as encoding an indirect quote, it also displays the semantic
notion of purpose. In fact, -fe in both of its semantic senses is regularly used to
encode purpose (see §3.3.5).
(26) Nali fo-fe
ne-lee,
tetu fo-be.
3.PN eat-1S.IR say-3S.R then eat-3S.IR
‘If he thinks of eating then he’ll eat.’Kwomtari Grammar1598.4 Complex sentences
Complex sentences contain one or more dependent clauses, together with an
independent clause. They are conjoined by the suffixes -ke ‘SEQ’, -i ‘SIM’ or a
conjunction. The final, independent clause is the only one which may be marked
either for realis or irrealis status. Preceding clauses are marked with default realis
status, but in fact take their status from the final clause.","[165, 166, 167, 168, 169]"
"10. Discourse level
Discourses can be divided into two types: those that are iconically ordered, and
those that are conceptually oriented.
Within the first type are narratives - both personal and ancestral (legends), and
procedures. This type has many long sentences, with clauses linked by the verb final
suffixes -ke and -i, fixing the events firmly in time. Conjunctions other than te are
rarely used, except tetu ‘then’ which occurs frequently in procedural texts. Tail-head
linkage is often used, where the final verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb
of the next. Narrative texts are given realis status, while procedural texts take 2nd
person irrealis subject/status markers. Narrative texts use the different durative
aspects for foregrounding and backgrounding of material. Proximal durative,
normally used (with realis status) to mark present, occurs in narratives to mark
backgrounded durative events. Distal durative, which correctly indicates the real time
of the event (in the past), occurs with durative events which are more focal to the
narration.
The second type of discourses include descriptions, explanations and hortatory
texts. These types make greater use of the conjunctions tete ‘therefore’, and tefe ‘so’.
Sentences are generally much shorter than in narrative or procedural texts and many
are simple sentences. Descriptions take realis status; explanations and hortatory texts
fluctuate between stating facts, using realis status, and predicting consequences, with
irrealis status.
The text given in the appendix is a personal narrative.","[178, 179]"
"Kwomtari Phonology Essentialsby Julia Drew1. Introduction
This paper examines and describes the sound system and phonological
processes apparent in the Kwomtari language. It is not intended to be exhaustive,
and alterations may be made as more data is uncovered.
The corpus of data used in this analysis was collected mainly by Murray and
Carol Honsberger, between 1990 and 1997. This paper is based on data collected
from the Baifeni dialect. In 1998, I was privileged to live and work among the
people of Baifeni for nine weeks, from early February to mid April. Working
under the GRIP (UK) programme, this time was spent collecting more language
data for working towards both the Grammar Essentials and the Phonology
Essentials of the language with my colleague, Katharine Spencer. I also spent time
refining the aforementioned corpus of data which had been entered into the
FindPhone programme from the lexicon (of over 800 entries), by compiling word
lists to compare and contrast certain phones. Tomas Didiki and Yesefe Sukwari
have been the principal language helpers since 1989, but I also received help from
Robert Kosme, Diksen Gumute and Lukas Dimeni (as well as numerous other
villagers with less experience of language work) during my nine week stay.
Major areas of interest in Kwomtari Phonology include labialisation, and the
interrelationship between [ɖ] and [ɭ], which have caused some controversy among
the Kwomtari people. The analysis of semivowels is also problematic. The Baifeni
dialect was specifically chosen for analysis work because it is spoken in the most
central village in the Kwomtari language area, where it is expected to have
undergone minimal influence from other surrounding language groups. However,
this dialect is clearly not immune from influence from the surrounding dialects,
which show enough difference to cause confusion in the phonology. This
influence is mainly due to intermarriage between villages, and I would expect the
language to change towards only one phonological system in the future.
This paper first sets out the phonemes of the language, together with the
evidence for their existence (§2). Sections 3, 4 and 5 successively look at
phonotactic constraints in Kwomtari, resulting phonological rules and18Phonology Essentials19suprasegmentals. Section 6 discusses morphophonemic rules found in the
language, and the final section briefly makes recommendations for the
orthography.

I would like to express my appreciation to the following people for their
contribution to this paper.
Special thanks go to Tomas Didiki and Diksen Gumute for their hours of
dedicated work in producing Kwomtari words more times than they enjoyed in
order to help me build up a good corpus of data to work from. Thank you for your
patience!
Thanks also go to Katharine Spencer for all her support and help as we
explored the Kwomtari language together. My work on the Phonology Essentials
and her work on the Grammar Essentials was often interrelated.
I would like to thank Eileen Gasaway for all her help as my consultant, and
for her helpful seminar notes.
Thank you, Murray and Carol Honsberger for your commitment to the
Kwomtari people – for all the work you have already accomplished and for all that
will follow this paper. I am especially grateful to you, Carol, for your wisdom and
your encouragement to persevere through the difficult times in the village. This
paper is a small contribution to your work, and I owe its completion to you and to
God for using me in my weakness.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

people and languageCarol Honsberger

1.1 Language setting
Kwomtari is a Papuan (i.e. non-Austronesian) language spoken in Sandaun (West
Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea. Its approximately 800 speakers are
traditionally hunter-gatherers, who inhabit six villages in the interior of the province.
The language region occupies about 400 square kilometres, and is located between 40
and 60 kilometres east of the Indonesian border (see Map 1).
MAP 1: THE KWOMTARI AREA WITHIN PNG2Introduction3Kwomtari is one of six languages generally grouped together as the ‘Kwomtari
family’. This family is not demonstrably related to any of the larger Papuan families
(e.g. Trans New Guinea, Sepik, Torricelli). To date, virtually no materials have been
published from any of the languages in the family. The only exception is the Fas
language, on which two brief articles have appeared (Baron 1979, 1983a); more
recently, several articles have been posted on the web, also relating to Fas (Baron
2007, n.d.; Blake 2007).
Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse country in the world; in turn,
Sandaun Province is probably linguistically the most diverse region in Papua New
Guinea. Within an area of 36,300 km2 and a population of 185,741 (2000 census),
there are 102 languages – an average of only 1,821 speakers per language – belonging
to eight distinct language families, together with perhaps three isolates (Ross
2005:30). Kwomtari is immediately adjoined by the following languages: Baibai to
the north, Guriaso to the east, Yalë (also known as Nagatman) to the south, Nai (also
known as Biaka) to the south-west, and Amanab to the west. However, the number of
languages within a few days walk is immense (refer Map 2).
MAP 2: KWOMTARI AND NEIGHBOURING LANGUAGES4IntroductionThe area where Kwomtari is spoken is the lowland plain south of the Bewani
Mountains. This mountain range, about 35 kilometres to the north, rises to 1500
metres above sea level, and is the source of rivers which flow southward through the
language area toward the upper reaches of the Sepik River. In contrast, the language
area is largely flat, gradually sloping from 160 metres above sea level in its north to
80 metres elevation in the south. This terrain is covered by dense tropical rainforest
and sago swamp. The language area is bounded in the south by the Yagroner Hills, an
outcropping of about a dozen peaks, the tallest rising to 625 metres; the villages south
of the hills speak Yalë. Yanebi airstrip, in the north of the language area, is located at
a latitude of 3° 31.31’ south and a longitude of 141° 27.69’ east.
The language area has a hot and humid climate. Temperatures vary between an
overnight minimum of about 24 degrees Celsius and a daytime maximum of about 40
degrees. Annual rainfall is between 2000 and 2500 millimetres, with the wet season
roughly between November and March.
Total population was 606 at the time of the 2000 census,1 but is now closer to 800
given the recorded annual births by the SIL team. In total, six villages speak the
language: Kwomtari, Mango, Baifeni, Yanebi, Yaur and Wagreni. (In addition, there
is a settlement known as the Moitari camp, which is not considered a village since it
is occupied only by one clan.) The largest village is Yaur, but Baifeni is considered
the most central village geographically and linguistically.2
The villages are situated on three rivers flowing southward through the language
area. The westernmost of these is the Sukura River (shown on some maps as the
Pukwor). Kwomtari village is currently located on both sides of this river, just below
its confluence with the Yakura River.3 Mango is about two kilometres downstream,
also on both sides of the river. A small hamlet counted as part of Kwomtari village is
adjacent to the Kwomtari airstrip about three kilometres west of the river. East of the
Sukura River is the Senu (North) River, on which Yanebi and Baifeni are located,
with Yanebi furthest upstream. When the Senu River reaches the Yagroner Hills it
1The population figure of 782 given by Loving and Bass (1964) includes villages now considered to
belong to the Guriaso language (including Guriaso, Maragin, Mofor, Wurubai and Ekas).
2
Earlier sources call this village Baiberi. Several village elders have said that the Australian patrols that
came did not pronounce the name correctly, but the people were afraid to correct the white men. In
fact, they themselves began using the white men’s pronunciation of Baiberi. That is the pronunciation
the SIL team heard until 1992, when inhabitants began to revert to the original Baifeni.
3
Laycock (1981) shows a village called ‘New Kwomtari’ on the Bapi River, west of the Sukura. That
village site has been abandoned for several decades, although it is still considered part of the language
area.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"Kwomtari Grammar151If the predicate is verbal, the negated verb takes the suffix -i in addition to being
preceded by glei. It appears that -i is used to give clarification as to how much of a
sentence is being negated, since the scope of glei can extend over more than one verb.
Note that when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i
is evident. The negating suffix -i is homophonous with the clausal suffix -i showing
simultaneous action, and may sometimes have been confused with it.
(24) Inalilufwa glei Pita-le ri-ne-ke
people
NEG Peter-GL come-1/3P.R-SEQ
feta-ne-a-ne-i.
see-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R-NEG
‘The people did not habitually come and look at Peter.’
Mwa ‘no’ can also be used to clarify the scope of negation much as -i does, by
being placed after the clause, as discussed previously (§5.3.1). This is illustrated in
(25):
mwa, kame
(25) Te weife glei fo-po-ne,
FOC DU
NEG eat-DISTR-1/3P.R no
only
tuwa-po-ne.
carry.away-DISTR-1/3P.R
‘We two didn’t eat (them), we just carried them away.’
As example (26) shows, -i and mwa sometimes co-occur:
(26) Mena nebue glei amwi a-la-ne-i,
mwa.
1PL
now
NEG good do-P.DUR-1/3S.R-NEG no
‘Now we don’t act/do it well.’
Example (27) shows glei having a scope of two clauses, with mwa being used to
clarify the scope of negation.
(27) Kame glei tuwa-po-ne-ke
only NEG carry.away-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ
fu-po-ne-a-ne,
mwa.
tie-DSR-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R no
‘They didn’t just carry them away and tie them – no!’7.3 Relative clause
Relative clauses are formed by nominalising the verb with the suffix -lu. In the
majority of cases found in the data corpus, the relative clause precedes the noun it152Kwomtari Grammarmodifies. This contrasts with adjectival modifiers, which for inanimate nouns
generally follow the noun being modified. The fronting of the relative clause in the
noun phrase is due to it being a specifying constituent. In the following examples, the
relativised clause is underlined for clarity. Examples (28) and (29) show the
formation of restrictive relative clauses (relative clauses specifying the identity of the
head noun):
(28) tiafwi pipirine-ie-lu bwali
snake kill-1S.R-NN shell.ring
‘snake-killing-shell.ring’ (rings used in a snake-killing procedure)
na
(29) Lumi-fu
lufwa Gote-lu kaisekli feta-lee-lu
Lumi-ABL man God-NN strength see-3S.R-NN word
‘story about a man from Lumi seeing God’s strength’
In example (30) the relative clause functions as a qualifier instead of a specifier
and follows the noun phrase it modifies:
Gote le-te-lee-lu
(30) ka telu Aie
tree some father.1/2 God do-3P.O-3S.R-NN
‘some trees, which Father God made’8. Sentence structure
8.1 Simple sentences
A simple sentence contains one clause, which is marked on the verb for status realis or irrealis. The default status is realis, so this is the status assumed when the
predicate is nonverbal. The clause functions as the sentence base, and is associated
with a typical intonation.1 Examples (1) - (5) are examples of simple sentences:
(1) Nariemu-le ite-i
gria-le-lee.
wife-GL
house-LOC leave-do-3S.R
‘He left his wife at home.’
(2) Mene kotue
na-fo-fe.
1NPL tomorrow say-3S.O-1S.IR
‘I’ll tell him tomorrow.’
(3) Lie gaga le-la-lee-o.
sun heat do-P.DUR-3S.R-VOC
‘The sun is hot.’ (Lit. ‘The sun’s heat is doing.’)
(4) Lufwa ari-le
babrute-po-ne.
man child-GL beat-DISTR-1/3P.R
‘The men beat the children.’
(5) Nanu una-ne ari fane-o-be.
3.PN 2.PN-GL child give-1/2S.O-3S.IR
‘She will give the child to you.’
The sentence may also contain constituents that are external to the main clause.
Dik (1991:19) describes this type of constituent as a ‘theme’. Themes convey
pragmatic information, e.g. highlighting a sentential topic or focus, presenting an1[Editors’ note] Unfortunately, time did not allow for acoustic analysis of the intonation patterns of the
language, so this comment is based on the researcher’s aural impressions.","[160, 161, 162, 163]"
"170Kwomtari Grammar171e. Durative aspect in complex sentences
The meanings involved here have only been tentatively proposed in this paper
and further clarification is needed. Certainly a difference between the two suffixes -la
‘P.DUR’ and -me ‘D.DUR’ should be obtained.
f. Particle analysis
There is a need to more fully analyse and explain the uses of -me, -i, -ke and some
of the other particles.
g. Polar questions and pe ‘POSB’
Polar questions formed by the possibility particle pe (POSB) are indistinguishable
from statements like “possibly…” It may be that an intonation contour distinguishes
them from statements. Also, the function of pe ‘POSB’ in the following construction is
not clear.
(1) Fori pe
a-te-ne-lu-fe
lufwa a-te-ne.
pig POSB do-3P.O-1/3P.R-NN-RSN man do-3P.O-1/3P.R
‘It wasn’t pigs that did it – it was men (e.g. messed up the garden).’
h. Morpheme -tie
This morpheme, whose meaning is unknown, has been mentioned in §5.6. It may
have an exclamatory or modal function.
i. Causative impersonal constructions
These should be further examined. They were discussed briefly in §4.1.4.
j. Discourse analysis
Discourse analysis largely remains to be done. Uses of tail-head linkage, other
links, etc. should help in the process of analysing what features each discourse type
manifests. The discourse types are iconically ordered discourses (e.g. narrative,
procedural) and thematically oriented discourses. (e.g. descriptive, explanatory and
hortatory). There is some preliminary marking on some of the texts we have that
gives some clues.","[180, 181]"
"4.2.2 Object suffixes
These mark patients and recipients, often cross-referenced on the noun with the
goal suffix -le. The object markers are listed in table 14.

With ditransitive verbs (e.g. ‘give’), the object suffix references the recipient
rather than the patient. This is shown in (39) and (40):
(39) Nanu una-ne ari
fane-o-be.

for or with. It is similar to the object suffixes in that it refers to a patient. The prefix is
not person or number specific. Examples (41) and (42) show a patient being
referenced by the accompanier prefix:
(41) Te yeu
na-fo-ne
eese-ife-a-me-ne.

1NPL 1.PN-NN wife take-1S.R-SEQ ACM-go-1S.R
‘I got my own wife, then went with her/took her with me.’
This accompanier prefix normally occurs with patients which are animate.
However, they may be dead, as in example (43) where a dead pig is being carried
home:Kwomtari Grammar111(43) Nanu afue-lee-ke

ife-le-me-lee-ke
ACM-do-D.DUR-3S.R-SEQ ACM-do-D.DUR-3S.R-SEQ
‘He carried it and carried it on and on...’
It can be prefixed internally in compound verbs, before the derivational verb for
type 1 compounds, and even before na ‘word’ for type 2 compounds (refer to
example (44)). Note that in this example ife- is used in conjunction with an object
marker to refer to the same patient:
(44) Nia-ne sabu-ife-na-ne-o-lee-ke
ka-me
pina-le-ie.
1S.R-GL chase-ACM-say-say-1/2S.O-3S.R-SEQ tree-CER ascend-do-1S.R
‘It (pig) chased me and I climbed a tree.’
It can also be used to mark a third argument of the verb. In example (45), the verb
stem fane ‘give’ requires a singular patient (see §4.1.3), which is therefore the water.
The plural object suffix -te on the following verb a ‘do’ references the cassowary
chicks which are the recipients of the verb, while the accompanier prefix ife- refers to
the water.
(45) Meli-le-me
fane-fane ife-a-te-la-lu.
water-GL-CER RED-give ACM-do-3P.O-P.DUR-2S.R
‘You keep giving them (i.e. cassowary chicks) water.’4.2.4 Distributive suffix -po
The distributive suffix -po is used to indicate that plural agents or patients
participate equally in the event. If the verb is transitive, then the distribution is over
plural patients, as in (46):6
(46) Sebei-le i-fi
amblue-po-bile.
bark-GL fire-LOC heat-DISTR-1/3P.IR
‘We will heat each piece of bark in the fire.’
The suffix can also be used with a single patient acted on by a plural agent. In this
case, -po indicates joint action:6Note that -po becomes -poo before the suffixes -ne, -la, -fwa and -mai, in accordance with the
morphophonemic rules (refer to §6.2.3 of paper by Drew, this volume).","[119, 120, 121]"
"Kwomtari Grammar97Example (102) shows that two postpositional phrases giving reason can be
embedded within one another:

pine-ie.
get.P-1S.R
‘I got my bow (and arrows) to go to hunt at the sago blind.’4. Verbs and verb phrases
Verbs are the major open word class in Kwomtari other than nouns. Verbs are
easily distinguished as they are always marked for subject. They also uniquely take a
set of object markers and a pair of aspect markers (see table 12). This chapter begins
with a discussion of the semantic features of verb stems (§4.1), then discusses the
affixes found on Kwomtari verbs (§4.2) and concludes with a description of the verb
phrase (§4.3).","[106, 107, 108]"
"1.3 Linguistic description
1.3.1 Language name and dialects
Speakers do not call their language Kwomtari; that name was given by the
pioneer surveyors Loving and Bass (1964) after the local airstrip. Speakers refer to
their language by their word for ‘why?’ Unfortunately, this is one of the few lexical
items with different variants in each of the six major villages. While in the central
village of Baifeni the language is called Glefe, in other villages it is variously called
Klefe, Kefe, or Kisofe. Since Loving and Bass also applied the name Kwomtari to a
putative language phylum, that name has become well-known by linguists, and it
seems best to retain it when describing the language for the outside world.
It is generally agreed that there are three dialects. The western dialect is spoken in
Mango and Kwomtari villages, the central dialect in Baifeni and Yanebi, and the
eastern dialect in Wagreni and Yaur. The two western villages have the greatest
lexical differences from the other villages. For example, their word for banana is ri,
where the other villages say beni or meni. In most cases known of, where Kwomtari
and Mango have a lexical difference from the other villages, their term is similar to
the corresponding term in the Nai language. The dialect differences do not seem to
affect communication between villages.",[21]

"48Kwomtari Phonologypurely on the height of the following vowel, but it has since become apparent that
these changes are the result of a select number of specific suffixes, and this cannot
be accounted for phonologically. Table 5 shows the suffixes which are affected.
TABLE 5: SUFFIXES AFFECTED BY VOWEL RAISING RULE3
Affected suffix
Verb stemConditioning suffix-o 1SG.O-ne 1/3PL.R-fo 3SG.O-la P.DUR-mo 1/2PL.O-fwa motion away-po distributive-mai ‘on top of’4As a result, the first singular object suffix /-ɔ/ becomes /u̞/ when -ne (first and
third plural realis subject marker) or -la (proximal durative aspect marker) are
suffixed directly after it. Example (23) shows the form of the morpheme /-ɔ/ when
not occurring with /-ne/ or /-la/. The verbal stem /na/ ‘say’ has been used:
(23)a./binaɔ/‘tell me first’b./naɔɭu/‘you told me’The examples in (24) show the same morpheme when affected by the presence
of -ne and -la:
(24)a./nau̞nɛ/‘they told me’b./nau̞ɭanɛ/‘they are talking to me’Example (25) shows the same process with the verb /ɸəta/ ‘see’:
(25)3a./ɸətaɔɭi̞ /‘he saw me’b./ɸətau̞ɭaɭi̞ /‘he sees me’[Editors’ note] Fuller descriptions of the glosses may be found in §6.2 of Spencer, this volume.
Note that not all the possible combinations in table 5 can actually occur, because of the verbal slots
occupied by different suffixes. For instance, -fwa occurs in the +2 slot occupied by motion
suffixes. Only the distributive marker -po may occur in the preceding +1 slot. As a result, only -po
can be conditioned by a following -fwa.
4
The suffix -mai is a nominal suffix, not a verbal one. See discussion below.","[57, 58]"
"5. Suprasegmentals
The Kwomtari language does not exhibit contrasts in nasalisation, tone or
vowel length. The only suprasegmental worthy of discussion in this section is
stress.
Stress is difficult to hear; often syllables seem to carry equal stress, or a given
word is pronounced with different stress on different occasions. There are no
examples of contrastive stress. In a bisyllabic word uttered in isolation, the first
syllable often sounds stronger, but the second syllable carries rising pitch. As
noted in §2.2, a syllable containing schwa is not stressed (with the single
exception of /mənə/ [ˈmənə]), so a word containing schwa in its initial syllable will
normally have its stress on the second syllable.
How, then, is stress realised? According to Lehiste (1970:106):
When the speaker’s activity in producing stressed syllables is in
focus, stress may be defined in terms of greater effort that enters
into the production of stressed syllable as compared to an
unstressed syllable…Ultimately, differences in stress are due to
differences in physical effort. The effort is reflected directly in the
activity of the muscles involved in respiration, and indirectly in
subglottal pressure.
She then explains that intensity and fundamental frequency (pitch) can both be
important factors in stress production and identification. Both involve this ‘effort’
on the part of the speaker, but they usually work together, rather than
independently. The speaker will be aware of which syllable he is stressing, but the
hearer perceives both intensity and pitch in the same way, since intensity involves
greater amplitude of the individual pulses and pitch involves a greater number of
pulses reaching the ear ‘per unit time’ (Lehiste 1970:145-146). However the
hearer is not concerned by which syllable is stressed, if stress is not contrastive.
When words were fitted into the frames ‘he said_’, ‘this man said_’ and ‘did
this man say_?’, all words were stressed on the final syllable, whether the word42Kwomtari Phonology43was affixed or unaffixed. Words of more than two syllables also exhibited
secondary stress, which fell on the first syllable of three and four syllable words,
and the second syllable of five syllable words. The two stresses (second syllable
and final syllable) in five syllable words often sounded equal.
The analysis of stress remains uncertain, but since stress does not seem to
operate contrastively (or even consistently), this subject may be regarded as
worthy of further study but not significant in Kwomtari phonology.","[51, 52, 53]"
"2.1 Nouns
A noun functions syntactically as the head of a noun phrase. As head of noun
phrases that function as subjects or objects, a noun is cross-referenced on the verb for
person and number. Semantically, nouns realise people, places, things, ideas. Nouns
are further distinguishable from other classes in that only they can be modified by the
intensifier feti ‘very/truly’1.",[66]

For possessive and object pronouns, the stem mena is used regardless of number,
as in (48) and (49). (Note that the possessive and object forms of third person
pronouns are formed with the suffixes -lu and -le respectively, but for first and second
person pronouns the suffixes used are -nu and –ne10.

Te also functions as a postpositional clitic, where it marks contrastive focus (see
§3.1.2). Additionally, te is used in constructions meaning ‘all sorts of X’, where X is
a noun. See examples (26) and (27) in §2.1.5. Note also that te is homophonous with
the third person plural object suffix on the verb.6.1.2 feti intensifier
The particle feti follows the noun or noun phrase that it modifies. It gives the
meaning of ‘true’, ‘really’, or ‘very’.

only go-1S.R house-LOC-GL
‘I just went home.’6.1.4 Noun negator preme ~ prelu ‘absence’
The particle preme ‘absence’ is a noun negator; it denies the existence of the
preceding noun within the predicate. This usage is illustrated in (18); the noun ragulu
‘of branches’ is part of the predicate, and so its existence is denied. Eetegeni ka is the
subject, not part of the predicate, and its existence is not affected by preme.
(18) Eete-geni ka ragu-lu
preme
feti le-lee.
here-thing tree branch-NN absence very do-3S.R
‘This tree had no branches.’
If there is no noun present in the predicate, then preme denies the existence of the
most likely noun that would be there. In example (19), the house is the subject and142Kwomtari Grammarnot part of the predicate, so preme is not denying the existence of the house but the
existence of anything in the house.
(19) Ite
preme

house absence stand.S-P.DUR-3S.R
‘The house stands empty.’
The negator preme occurs with deverbals to indicate that the action expressed by
the deverbal has not occurred.

‘Wopenei was there, without having had her child, when we arrived.’
The particle prelu has almost identical meaning to preme. Its final -lu requires
that it is the final constituent of a noun phrase, rather than a clausal constituent. This
is illustrated in (22) and (23):
(22) rori meli prelu
fish water absence
‘absence of fish water’
(23) eete-geni lufwa kaisekli prelu

The particles keme and kelu, both meaning ‘resemblance’, follow the noun or
noun phrase which is the object of comparison, X. This construction is used with the
verb le ‘do’ to form a predicate, meaning ‘to resemble X’ (see also §7.1.4).

The particle tuke has a similar function and distribution to the comitative
postposition -tu2 (see §3.2.2). Unlike -tu, which belongs to the subject of a clause,
tuke acts in the predicate, marking dual objects, reasons or instruments. Tuke follows
the argument it is marking. It can be marked on both arguments (example (29)) or just
the second of the two (example (30)):

(28)a./ɭɛɸu̞nɛ/‘they did to him’b./naɸu̞ɭanɛ/‘they are telling him’c./uririnaɸu̞ɭaɭi̞ /‘he is choosing it’The rule also applies to /-mɔ/, the first and second person plural object suffix.5
Example (29) illustrates the unmodified form of the suffix:
(29)/namɔɭi̞ kɛ/‘he told us, and then…’Example (30) shows the vowel raising rule applied:
(30)/namu̞ɭaiɛ/‘I am telling you this’The same morphophonemic rule affects the distributive suffix /-pɔ/. This
suffix also undergoes change when preceding /-ne/ and /-la/, but because of this
morpheme’s different position in the verb the same change occurs in association
with the suffix of motion /-ɸwa/. Example (31) shows the occurrence of this
morpheme when not affected by the vowel raising rule:
(31)a./tɛripɔ/‘bring lots!’b./aru̞pɔtu/‘with plenty of rain’c./susunapɔtɛnɛi/‘when their (hands) are tired’The examples in (32) show the application of the vowel raising rule:
(32)a./tɛriɛpu̞nɛ/‘we/they brought plenty’b./napu̞ɸuanɛ/‘they talked a lot while doing’The distributive marker can also be suffixed to nouns. In this position, it may
undergo vowel raising when followed by the suffix -mai ‘on top of’. This is
illustrated in (33):
(33)5a./iɛbɔɛpɔ/‘plenty of mats’b./iɛbɔɛpu̞mai/‘on plenty of mats’[Editors’ note] Presumably the same rule is capable of affecting -mo, the second person realis
subject suffix, which is identical in form. However, because of the ordering of verb suffixes, none
of the conditioning suffixes can occur after that suffix.","[59, 60]"
"3.3.3 Goal -le
The postposition -le is used with motion verbs to mark an entity as a place toward
which the subject is moving, the goal of movement. Examples (64) - (66) show this
usage in Kwomtari. Note that when -le is used in this sense, it is always preceded by
the locative marker (-i or -fi):
wa-lee.
(64) Bali-fi-le
garden-LOC-GL go-3S.R
‘He went to the garden.’
wa-lee.

village-LOC-GL go-3S.R
‘He went to the village.’
(66) Ite-i-le
ri-ie.
house-LOC-GL come-1S.R
‘I came to the house.’
When the goal is a place name, -le is not attached directly to the name. The place
name is followed by a common noun describing the place, and then the locative and
goal markers, as in (67):Kwomtari Grammar91(67) Mene weife Nicke-tu
Yetomi wokoo-i-le
wa-ne-lu
1NPL DU
Nick-COM Yetomi village-LOC-GL go-1/3P.R-NN
na.
account
‘Account of Nick and I going to Yetomi.’
More frequently in the corpus, the goal marker -le is suffixed to the patient or
recipient of the clause. The verb generally has an object suffix referring to the same
entity. Imonda, a geographically close but unrelated language, has a suffix which is
similarly used to indicate recipients and patients as well as the goal of directional
movement (Seiler 1985:161-165). Examples (68) - (72) show various shades of use of
-le with recipients and patients:

There may be more than one noun in a clause taking the goal marker. Example
(73) shows that -le may be suffixed to both elements of a complex object. Note that
the object marking on the verb is plural:92Kwomtari Grammar(73) Lufwa-le ari-le
na-te-bule.
man-GL boy-GL say-3P.O-2P.IR
‘You (pl) will tell the men and boys.’
Examples (74) and (75) show that -le may also be affixed to both the patient and
the recipient of a ditransitive verb. Note that -le changes to -ne following a first or
second person pronoun:6
(74) Mena-ne eete-geni mamelei-le

Occasionally only the recipient of a ditransitive verb will be marked with -le, as
in (76):

fane-o-be.
3.PN 2.PN-GL child give.S-1/2S.O-3S.IR
‘She will give the child to you.’3.3.4 Instrument -tu
The comitative use of -tu has been discussed above in §3.2.2. It is also used in the
predicate, where it marks a noun which is used in carrying out the action of the verb,
i.e. an instrument. Examples (77) - (79) show this usage:

"6.2 Morphophonemic variations affecting verbs
6.2.1 First person singular subject marker
Verbs ending in /ɛ/ delete /ɛ/ when suffixed with the first person singular
subject marker (-ie /iɛ/). This process is illustrated in examples (14) - (17):1(14)/kiɸɛ + -iɛ//kiɸiɛ/‘I cut’(15)/niɸɛ + -iɛ//niɸiɛ/‘I follow’(16)/uririnɛ + -iɛ//uririniɛ/‘I choose’(17)/i̞nɛ + -iɛ//i̞niɛ/‘I cry’[Editors’ Note] The underlying form of mene is /'mənə/. Since /mə'nɐnu/ ‘my/mine’ is permitted,
the analysis should perhaps read ‘Three identical nasals are not permitted in a single word.’Kwomtari Phonology476.2.2 Vowel harmony
Stem-final /ɛ/ on verbs is frequently rounded and backed when a syllable
ending in /u/ is suffixed. This rule is optional; my language advisors inform me
that the vowel may remain unchanged and still be well-formed. However, my
impression is that this rule is usually applied. The rule is illustrated in (18) - (20)
below; all the examples are well-formed:
(18)/puɛɭu/ ~ /puɔɭu/‘you dug’(19)/jəunɛtɛɭu/ ~ /jəunɛtɔɭu/ ‘you laughed at them’(20)/tuɛɭu/ ~ /tuɔɭu/‘you cooked’Example (21) demonstrates that the alternate forms in (20) are the result of
vowel harmony:
(21)/tuɛɭi̞ / ~ */tuɔɭi̞ /‘he/she cooked’Vowel harmony is a morphophonemic rule occurring with verb suffixes, not a
phonological rule throughout the language. The following words, all found in the
language, do not show vowel harmony:2
(22)a./aiɛbu/‘crayfish’b./bɛsuka/‘rafter’c./iɭɛkuɭi/‘fire pit’d./kaɭiɛɸu/‘bird’e./ɛsuɭu/‘immediately’f./prijɛmu/‘string’6.2.3 Vowel raising
When the low-mid back vowel /-ɔ/ is the final vowel in a verbal suffix, it is
raised to the lowered high vowel /-u̞/ if it immediately precedes any of a specific
set of verbal suffixes. At first, it seemed as though these changes were based
2[Editors’ note] it appears that the morphophonemic rule is in the process of generalising, becoming
a phonological rule. Some speakers have been heard to say [bɔsukɐ] for besuka, [iɭɔkuɭi] for
ilekuli, and [prijɔmu] for priemu. However, this tendency is less marked than the morphophonemic
rule noted above.","[56, 57]"
"1.3.3 Linguistic classification
The classification of Kwomtari is controversial. It is generally agreed that the
language cannot be assigned to the Trans New Guinea family or any of the other
major families (Wurm and McElhanon 1975:156; Ross 2005). Loving and Bass
(1964), on the basis of lexical similarity between 4% and 12% measured against 180word Swadesh wordlists, grouped Kwomtari, Nai (Biaka), Fas and Baibai together as
the ‘Kwomtari phylum’. Within this larger grouping, they distinguished two pairs of
languages showing greater similarity to each other; Kwomtari was paired with Nai,
and Fas with Baibai.
Laycock (1973, 1975) reversed these subgroupings, pairing Kwomtari with Fas,
and Baibai with Nai. Since he did not state the basis for this reversal, it is difficult to
determine his reasons, although he stated his classifications were not ‘based onIntroduction13detailed lexicostatistic analysis or comparison’, but were ‘impressionistic… the
accumulated effects of…noting resemblances and differences as they emerged’
(1973:2). It is likely that his criterion was grammatical structure, since he concluded
that Kwomtari and Fas both lack verbal subject concordance; this conclusion is now
known to be incorrect (see below). Nevertheless, Laycock’s prominence has ensured
that his subgroupings of the languages have been until recently the basis of most
published classifications, e.g. in Ethnologue (Gordon 2005). Laycock also added to
the ‘Kwomtari phylum’ Pyu, a language on the PNG-Indonesian border.
Baron (1983b) took 100-word lists in each of the languages to assess the validity
of these rival classifications, again using the criterion of lexical similarity. In the
process, he also established the separate status of Guriaso. Baron’s results support the
original subgrouping by Loving and Bass. He finds that Kwomtari and Nai are
closely related, and Guriaso somewhat more distantly related to both; there is also a
close relationship between Fas and Baibai, but not strong evidence of a relationship
between them and the Kwomtari-Nai-Guriaso grouping. Why Baron’s survey was not
published is unclear, but it has now at last been posted on the web.13 Any definitive
grouping of the Kwomtari languages must depend on the application of the historicalcomparative method; however, Baron’s greater methodological rigour and Laycock’s
lack of engagement with previous work mean that Baron’s classification must be
considered more reliable.
A recent development is the suggestion by Ross (2005:30) of a relationship
between the Kwomtari family and the Arai (Left May) family, based on pronoun
similarities.","[22, 23]"
"164Kwomtari Grammar1659.3 Prohibitives (negative imperatives)
Prohibitives can be directed at either a second or third person. The prohibitive
markers are kose ‘lest’ initially, and mani ‘PHB’ finally.2 They are associated with
status marking appropriate to the context. Appropriate status subject markers are used
for the circumstance, i.e. irrealis for something that hasn’t been done. Second person
prohibitives are normally realis. This may be because they are directed to a person
involved in doing or about to do the forbidden activity. All other examples of
negative imperatives in the current data corpus are irrealis.

9.4.1 Question words
Three bases are used in formation of question words: ake, gle and ine. Suffixes
are freely added to these bases to form the question words.
The basic meaning of ake is ‘how’. It contains the two morphemes a ‘do’, and ke,
which appears to be the same as is used in demonstrative forms. Ake’s verbal base
explains its function as questioning a verb or arguments thereof. Common question
words formed from ake are given in (9) below:

akei
‘where’ (how-LOC)

akenifi‘how many’ (<ake-ake ‘how-how’)
‘what kind’ (how-NN)
‘how’ (intensified)
‘which’ (<ake-geni ‘how-thing’)
‘where’ (which-LOC)Gle means ‘what’ and in general applies to nouns. Its relation to the negating
particle glei is unclear. Pronouns formed from gle appear in (10):
(10) gle
‘what, which’

in questions. The following examples show ine ‘whoever’ and glemegleme ‘whatever
place’ used in their indefinite sense.

"4.1.5 Existential verbs
Kwomtari has no copular verb but it does have ways of saying that things exist,
using various verbs. The most commonly used existential verb is la ‘remain’. This is
closest to the copula in meaning; it indicates that something is really present, rather
than abstractly existing; and in a specific location (though this may not be explicitly
expressed). La is also unusual in having slightly different forms for plural animates
and inanimates; animates use la (example (24)), but inanimates use lai (25):
la-la-ne.

immovable (e.g. houses, trees, standing plants) are said to ‘stand’ rather than simply
‘remain’. But note that the verb teme ‘stand’ can be used with any noun under
appropriate conditions.

natural than the equivalent sentence using la, as cassowaries do not remain still.

Subject suffixes are the only obligatory markers on the verb. Subject marking has
a nominative-accusative orientation; the subjects of intransitive verbs (28) and (30)
receive the same suffixes as the corresponding actors of transitive verbs (29) and
(31):

postpositional phrases
Postpositions and postpositional clitics are difficult to distinguish and will
therefore be treated together. Both attach to noun phrases or other postpositional
phrases. They indicate the relationship to the predicate of the noun phrase they index.
Functionally, they can be divided into three sets:
1. those that express the modal outlook the speaker has in regard to
the marked noun,
2. those that relate one noun to another, and
3. those that relate a noun to the clausal predicate (usually a verb).
The discussion of postpositions will cover these three sets in order (§3.1, §3.2,
§3.3), and will be followed by a description of postpositional phrases (§3.4). One
postposition, -tu ‘COM’ has a dual function and belongs to both set 2 and set 3; it is
therefore discussed in both §3.2 and §3.3.","[85, 86, 87, 88]"

A tail constituent (Dik 1991:19) is external to the clause and positioned at the
sentence terminus. It is distinguished from the main clause by a slight pause which
follows the verb. Tail constituents are illustrated in (9) and (10):

vowel phonemes, but can be demonstrated through the phonotactic constraints of
the language. One reason for this difficulty is that the vowel /ɛ/ is often
pronounced [ə], apparently in any environment. An example is given in (7):
(7)[ɛkɛni] ~ [əkəni]/ɛkɛni/‘that’Schwa never receives stress when other vowels are present in a word. The
sole instance of a stressed schwa is the word /mənə/ [mənə], in which the initial
schwa is stressed. Additionally, Kwomtari language advisors who have been
educated in the five-vowel system of Tok Pisin have a tendency to omit a symbol
for this sound when they are writing certain words. The following words are
written without schwa quite frequently (angle brackets enclose common
spellings):
(8)/məɭi/[məɭi]<mli>‘water, river’/mənə/[mənə]<mne, mune>‘I’/ɸəta/[ɸətɐ]<fta>‘see’It is sometimes difficult to hear the schwa between the consonants, but I am
convinced it is present. When these words are spoken slowly and deliberately, the
vowel is evident. This cannot be said concerning other consonant clusters in the
language, which are only permitted when the second is a liquid (see §3.3). As
further support of this analysis, note that these three words are the only ones30Kwomtari Phonologyexhibiting these ‘consonant clusters’ (other than <afteli>, discussed below). More
examples of /mɭ/, /mn/ and /ɸt/ would be expected if they were true clusters.
Further evidence is the word <afteli> ‘quickly’. This word is probably
underlyingly /a.ɸə.tɛ.ɭi/ [ɐ.βə.tɛ.ɭi], with a syllable divison following /a/, and
schwa between /ɸ/ and /t/. The alternative would require an initial VC syllable
/aɸ/, which is a syllable type not found elsewhere in the language (see §3.1).
However, there are a few contrastive pairs for schwa:

3.1 Syllable structure
The most common pattern for Kwomtari syllables is CV. Only syllables
consisting of onset + peak (e.g. CV) may occur in non-initial position. Closed
syllables, which are very rare, may not end with a plosive; generally the final
segment is a nasal. There are no unambiguous examples of VC syllables.
Examples of acceptable syllable patterns follow:

"100Kwomtari Grammara. Type 1 Compound verbs
This first type of compound verbs are formed with a noun and one of the four
basic verb stems given in the first column of table 8. Compounds formed in this way
vary according to how bonded the noun and the verb are. For some, the noun and the
verb stem form one intonational word, as in the compound verbs listed in table 10.
With others, the noun and verb are separate intonational words. Verbs formed with le
‘do’ or ne ‘say’ greatly outnumber those formed with a ‘do’ or la ‘remain’. Only
scattered examples of verbs formed with these latter two have been found. The
examples given for a in table 9 may have originally been repetitive aspect
constructions, the first being used in the reciprocal sense (since apure-apure-a ‘fight
each other’ must occur with plural subject). In fact, apure ‘fight’ is obligatorily used
in reduplicated form. Similarly, paiepaie ‘be happy’ cannot be split.

"Kwomtari Grammar1174.2.7 Aspect
Kwomtari is seen to display aspect marking in three different ways. First,
durative aspect is marked on the verb; secondly, habitual aspect can be formed by a
serial verb construction; thirdly, repetitive aspect can be formed by a different serial
construction using reduplication.
a. Durative Aspect
-la
P.DUR (proximal durative)
-me
D.DUR (distal durative)
Durative aspect signals that an event perseveres over an extended period of time.
Note that the proximal durative suffix -la is the same as and apparently derived from
the verb la ‘remain’. Table 16 below summarises the interaction of the durative aspect
markers with status marking on the verb in ordinary conversation.
TABLE 16: INTERACTION OF DURATIVE ASPECT WITH STATUS MARKINGAspect/status
markingTime of event-la + REALISevent is ongoing now-la + IRREALISevent will be ongoing soon, i.e. immediate future-me + REALISevent went on for a while in the past-me + IRREALISevent will go on for a while in the more distant futureIn extended discourse and in any complex sentence the situation is more
complex; see §8.4.1 for discussion. Examples (71) and (72) illustrate the use of the
proximal durative suffix with realis and irrealis status respectively, while examples
(73) and (74) illustrate the use of the distal durative suffix with realis and irrealis.

‘(After you have avoided eating what you kill for a while), you’ll keep

FOCb. Habitual Aspect
Habitual aspect is formed by a serial verb construction of the stem a ‘do’ with a
preceding stem specifying the habitual action. Each stem hosts its own subject/status
suffix. The relationship of the predicate to the time interval here is one of intermittent
occurrence, the time interval being extended indefinitely in either direction.

fish shovel-NOM-RSN go-1/3P.R-do-1/3P.R-NN account
‘Account of how we go to shovel fish.’
c. Repetitive Aspect
This aspect signals repeated occurrence over a restricted time interval. It can also
be used to encode a reciprocal relationship, where the event is repeated but with agent
and patient roles exchanged.
Repetitive aspect is encoded by the pro-verb a ‘do’ in combination with a lexical
verb. The lexical verb is reduplicated totally or partially, and a fully inflected a ‘do’
follows it, forming a compound. In simple verbs, the whole stem is reduplicated.

a-ne
RED-shake.hand do-1/3P.R
‘they shake each other’s hands’
With compound verbs the stem, minus the derivational stem, reduplicates (and
final a > e). In example (80), banane ‘angry’ is a compound verb: bana ‘anger’ + ne
‘say’. The derivational stem ne ‘say’ is dropped and the first stem bana becomes
bane. The same pattern occurs in (81) - (83):
(80) bane-bana a-lee

‘Some of you do the baskets to keep pouring in the middle, then…’
The reduplicated stem can also include the distributive suffix -po, as in (84):
(84) Wokoo-i-le
teri-po-teri-po
a-lu-ke…
village-LOC-GL carry-DISTR-carry-DISTR do-2S.R-SEQ
‘You keep carrying (log after log) to the village…’
Alternatively the whole verb with subject markers can be repeated creating a
complex sentence:120Kwomtari Grammar(85) Mwi le-tuwa-foo-la-ne-ke

‘We tracked it and tracked it and tracked it, then the dogs barked.’4.2.8 Deverbal suffix10 -ri
The deverbal suffix -ri derives a noun or non-finite form of the verb. The whole
verb phrase, including adverbs, goals and all suffixes preceding the subject, is
deverbalised and used in various constructions. The simplest is the straight use of -ri
on a verb to form a noun, as in (86) - (89):
(86) kumo-ri
move.east-NOM
‘east’
(87) fo-ri
eat-NOM
‘pig’
(88) fie-ri
hear/ask-NOM
‘a call/shout’
(89) wa-ri
go-NOM
‘walking’ (e.g. a person’s manner of walking)
Any noun derived with this suffix may then become part of a compound as in
(90) and (91):
metie oora-fw-ie.
(90) Boe rie-ri

"6Introductionplanted in their gardens. Watermelon, pineapples and cucumbers are more recent
additions to the various local fruits. Coconut and betel nut palms grow in and around
the villages. Sago, the main staple of their diet, grows unaided in the swamps. Most
families live off their own garden produce and what they forage from the rainforest
with minimal need for cash. The men hunt with bows and arrows, bringing home wild
pig and cassowary meat, which are usually shared with the entire village. Smaller
catches, such as possums, snakes, lizards, birds, and bush rats, are eaten within each
family unit. Crocodiles are also hunted for their meat and hide. The villages further to
the south hunt small deer. Other sources of protein include various nuts, grubs and
fowl eggs. At times people catch young pigs and cassowaries to raise in the village,
either for a feast or as a source of income.
Clans are patrilineal. There are recognized clan leaders within each clan.
Leadership is passed down to the oldest male within the clan. Clans continue to be a
very significant part of the social structure. Marriages are made in order to strengthen
relationships between clans, and are arranged by the male relatives of both parties. A
sister exchange may not be arranged within the same clan. Two instances are known
in which a man married someone from within his clan; both were met by opposition
from other clan members and the community at large. Arranged marriages remain the
norm, but the age of marriage for girls has risen to about the 16-20 year age range, as
opposed to 13-16 years. Generally, if a girl is in school, parents will postpone
marriage. It is common for a man to have two wives. A man will also marry his
brother’s widow.
The Kwomtari are animistic. Their fear of spirits permeates their way of life
affecting their daily actions and responses to people. Spirits are neither good nor bad,
having the ability to do good or to harm. Uppermost in the minds of the people is the
need to avoid offending either an individual, who could hire a sorcerer, or the spirits
themselves, and to know how to appease them. A sorcerer has the ability to
manipulate the spirits and can be paid for his services. Sickness and death are most
often attributed to a spiritual attack. The use of magic to counteract evil and sickness
is commonplace. Ceremonial dances (singsings in Tok Pisin), with their elaborate
preparations, are still performed to appease the spirits when someone is very ill. They
are also much enjoyed as a community activity, viewed as harmless in this context,
perhaps as a way of passing on the tradition.
Some vivid observations on Kwomtari culture in 1989 were made by Landweer
and Toivanen:Introduction7There is both material and behavioural evidence of a continuing
traditional culture.
There were longhouses in each village, which except for the
occasional nailed ladder, were entirely constructed of bush materials.
With the exception of one ‘western styled two storey’ house in
Yanebi (now abandoned in severe decay), all the houses were of
traditional fashion; windowless with two or more doors, a high
morota roof with long overhanging eaves, ‘sewn’ pangal walls and
limbum floors.6 The houses were built on posts anywhere from 4 to 8
feet [i.e. 1.2 to 2.4 metres] off the ground and are typically entered by
notched log ladders. In addition to the family centred longhouses,
each village had a young unmarried man’s house, and haus win.7 Of
the latter structures one in Wagreni was set up for women’s
communal cooking.
Inside the houses one sees a collection of traditional hunting,
gathering and cooking implements: bows, arrows, spears (often
highly decorated and diversified in fashion according to intended
function); fishing nets (umbens), loosely woven baskets, tree branch
hooks, and bark string bilums8. Other miscellaneous items noted are
pigs, croc[odile] and cassowary skulls or bones; limbum flower
brooms, and singsing bilas9 including shields and bird feathers.
About ¼ of the women wear purpurs of twisted saksak fibre.10 At
least 90% of the female population had facial tattoos, which we were
told were applied when they were children according to the desired
design of their mothers…
Western material evidenced included occasional nails, second hand
clothing (worn from about 8 years up), one broken hammer head, one

Some verbs have different singular and plural forms. Plural is marked according
to an ergative-absolutive orientation, i.e. the plural form of an intransitive verb marks
plural subject, while the plural form of a transitive verb marks a plural patient. The
verbs with different plural forms found so far are listed in table 11.

occurs with some nouns in the nearby language Imonda (Seiler 1985:38).

latter can only be used with people and animals/birds, but speakers say the use of it is
declining. Table 7 shows the demonstratives produced with these suffixes:

"Kwomtari Grammar69The mismatches between subject and other syntactic roles in marking pronoun
number suggest the distinctions may be recent. This may be due to change in the
language as a result of contact with neighbouring languages and Tok Pisin, which
have a clear distinction between singular and plural pronouns.
The pronouns une and mena can be joined to make une-mena ‘first person
inclusive plural’. This contrasts with mene weife ‘we two’, which may be inclusive or
exclusive of the hearer.
The pronouns in the second set are less commonly used. No second person
pronoun has been recorded for this set. The pronouns found for set 2 are listed in

There are four suffixes which occur verb-finally on dependent verbs (see §8.4 for
discussion of the relationship between dependent and independent clauses). Two of
these are medial clause markers; one suffix is subordinating; and one suffix marks the
end of a negated clause.
a. Coordinating Medial Verb Suffixes
The following verb suffixes occur on medial verbs only:122Kwomtari Grammar-ke
-i‘sequential’
‘simultaneous’11Unlike many other Papuan languages with medial verbs, Kwomtari has no
switch-reference system. Both -ke and -i may express relationships between verbs that
have the same subject (example (98)) or verbs that have different subjects (example
(99)). Note that -ke occurs in all types of discourse, not just narrative texts.

asine-ne-ke
(98) Mare-me wa-ne-ke

go-1/3P.R-SEQ see-1/3P.R-SEQ butcher-1/3P.R-SEQ
teri-po-ne
wokoo-i-le.
carry-DISTR-1/3P.R village-LOC-GL
‘They all went, saw it (the pig), butchered it, and carried it to the village.’

Seise food something give-DISTR-3S.R-SEQ eat-DSR-1/3P.R-SEQ
wa-ne.
te
aue kri-po-ne-ke
FOC bag carry-DISTR-1/3P.R-SEQ go-1/3P.R
‘Seise gave us food, we ate it, we carried our bags and went.’
The gloss ‘simultaneous’ does not cover the entire semantic range encoded by the
suffix -i. When the verb it occurs with is also marked with durative aspect (-la or
-me), it does mean simultaneous, in that the following verb occurs at the same time as
the marked verb (see example (100)). The verbal suffix -i can be considered similar to
the postposition -i, which binds a noun phrase to a particular location in space or
time. When no durative aspect is present, it marks a temporal contingency/condition,
similar to the English ‘when’. Used in sentences with realis status, its meaning is
similar to that of -ke, in that the marked verb is completed before the next verb
begins. But unlike -ke, which can be thought of as encoding the semantic notion of
English ‘after’, -i signals that the marked verb is an obligatory precondition for the
following verb to occur. Example (101) illustrates this. When a sentence has irrealis
status or is in the imperative mood, -i is used to express ‘when’ or ‘if’ that event
happens. This contrasts with -ke which marks a succession of events, the future
occurrence of the event being presumed. (See examples (102) and (103) below).
Efesise sekale-lee.
(100) I
fufa-la-ie-i
fire prepare-P.DUR-1S.R-SIM Ephesus arrive.S-3S.R
‘While I was making a fire, Ephesus arrived.’
11Note that -i is not apparent when it immediately follows u (as with the 2nd singular realis suffix -lu);
when -i follows the 3rd singular realis suffix -lee, -ee drops out and only -i is evident.","[130, 131, 132]"
"6.1 Particles
Kwomtari has a number of words or particles, each of which has a unique
function and distribution. These cannot be easily placed in a class along with other
words, so they are described here in their own right. Some of these particles (feti,
kame, preme, keme) are noun-like, but cannot function as the head of a noun phrase
so they cannot be nouns.6.1.1 te- ‘focus’
Te is Kwomtari’s most important particle. It is a focus marker with three
functions.1
The most common use of te is as a conjunction in discourse (see §6.2 for further
discussion). It functions like a recapitulatory constituent, linking the previous material
to the new. Te is the base for forming other conjunctions like tefe (FOC-RSN) ‘so’, tetu
(FOC-COM) ‘then’.

"Kwomtari Grammar853.2 Set 2 – Postpositions relating one noun to another
3.2.1 Noun phrase marker/nominaliser -lu
This postposition is used in many environments and I am unsure of its central
underlying meaning. I have glossed it NN, a noun phrase marker or nominaliser. NN
reflects its primary function, which is to relate nouns to nouns.
The postposition -lu marks animate possessors, as examples (36) and (37) show.
(36) Samuele-lu ite
Samuel-NN house
‘Samuel’s house’
(37) Gote-lu kaisekli
God-NN strength
‘God’s strength’
In modifier-modified compound nouns, where the first noun serves as a specifier
for the second noun, -lu is suffixed to the second noun, as in examples (38) and (39).
Adjectives (§2.1.3) tend to be the last item in a noun phrase, and in this position
always end in -lu (40). In each of these cases, -lu appears to indicate the terminal
member of a noun phrase.
(38) fwi
nagli-lu
coconut base-NN
‘base of the coconut (tree)’
(39) maie ai-lu
egg house-NN
‘bird’s nest’
(40) beni
wi-lu
banana ripe-NN
‘ripe banana’
When a noun phrase involves an animate being, a way (ami), or a story (na), the
behaviour seems to be different, with the adjective more often coming before the
noun:
(41) rame-lu
lufwa
knowledge-NN man
‘knowledgeable man’86Kwomtari GrammarThe suffix -lu acts to nominalise clauses. In this role it marks relative clauses,
normally preceding the noun that it modifies, due to its weight (see examples (42) and
(43)).
(42) afoo yefu
kuka-la-lee-lu
sineku

klifu-tu
yekrune-ne-lu
na.
cassowary-COM dog-COM fall.P-1/3P.R-NN account
‘Account of a cassowary and a dog falling.’
Examples (44) and (45) show clauses functioning as complete noun phrases, with
suffixation. In these cases -lu precedes other suffixes that relate the nominalised
expression to the predicate:
(44) Lie gaga ne-la-lee-lu-fi
sina-te-le.

FOC-COM pull-DST-2S.IR
‘The ones (grubs) that are right inside, after you have cut thorns, then
you’ll (use them to) pull them (grubs) out.’3.2.2 Comitative -tu
The postposition -tu is used in a comitative sense to conjoin two noun phrases
acting as subject. (See §3.3.4 for the related use of this postposition on nouns in the
predicate.) The suffix -tu only expresses dual accompaniment. It occurs sometimes
with the dual pronoun weife. Sometimes both nouns are marked (46), and sometimes
only the second (47). The resulting conjoined noun phrase causes the subject marker
on the verb to be plural. Where both noun phrases are marked, they are considered of
equal importance. Where only the second is marked, it is of secondary importance –
an accompanier to the first.

(48) Wofri-wofri-tu wa-lee.
RED-fear-COM go-3S.R
‘He went in (lit. with) great fear.’3.3 Set 3 – Postpositions relating a noun to the clausal
predicate
3.3.1 Locative -i, -fi
The postpositions -i, -fi both indicate the location of the marked noun phrase in
space or time. They are both allomorphs of one morpheme, -i occurring more
frequently. Words borrowed from Tok Pisin can host either allomorph; any of the
forms in (49) or (50) is acceptable:
(49) a. hefene-fi
heaven-LOC
‘in heaven’ (TP long heven)
b. hefene-i
heaven-LOC
‘in heaven’ (TP long heven)
(50) a. stua-fi
store-LOC
‘at/in the store’ (TP long stua)
b. stua-i
store-LOC
‘at/in the store’ (TP long stua)
Some vernacular nouns ending in u or i obligatorily occur with -i, but other nouns
ending in -u or -i may occur with -fi. The dialect of Kwomtari and Mango villages
always uses the -fi allomorph. It appears that the Baifeni dialect is also shifting to -fi88Kwomtari Grammarfor nouns ending in -u or -i to avoid the morphophonemic shifts that they require
when -i is suffixed4.
The morpheme -i seems to have a general meaning of anchoring an entity to a
location in space and time. This is evident in its use as a locative postposition, and as
a clause-final marker of simultaneous action -i ‘SIM’ (see §4.2.9).
Examples (51) - (54) show that the locative marker can be used with different
kinds of locations:
(51) Bule-i
purele-lu-ke…
basket-LOC put.in-2S.R-SEQ
‘You put them in the basket, and...’
la-la-ne.

a-la-ne.
(54) Fori si-silu
afwi-i
pig RED-baby trail-LOC do-P.DUR-1/3P.R
‘Baby pigs were on the trail.’
Example (55) shows that the locative can also be used to describe location in
time:
(55) Lufwa mwamole kotukrie-i klifu noune-lee-ke…
Man one
dawn-LOC dog take-3S.R-SEQ
‘One man at dawn took his dog and…’
When the location in question is a person, the suffix -lu is attached, followed by
locative -fi.
(56) Lufwa glei wa-be,
eete-geni inali-lu-fi-le.
man
NEG go-3S.IR, this-thing woman-NN-LOC-GL
‘A man mustn’t go – to this woman.’
Other locative postpositions may be used to mark a more specific location. All
are formed from a noun + -i. They include:
4Refer to §6.1.1 of paper by Drew (this volume).","[94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"
"8.4.1 Complex sentences encoding temporal relations
Complex sentences encoding temporal relationships manifest dependent clauses
that fit into two categories, depending on the final verb suffixation: (a) some take the
sequential suffix -ke (SEQ), which indicates that the marked clause refers to an event
preceding the one in the next clause; (b) others take the simultaneous suffix -i (SIM),
indicating that the marked clause refers to an event overlapping in some way with the
one in the next.
The functions of these suffixes have been discussed in §4.2.9. I give a few more
examples here:
klifu-lu
(27) Wa-ie-ke,
inegu pa-fo-ie-ke,
go-1S.R-SEQ earth dig-3S.O-1S.R-SEQ ankle-NN
fu-po-fo-ne-ke
boleta-fo-ie.
tie-DISTR-3S.O-1/3P.S-SEQ lift-3S.O-1S.R
‘After I went, after I dug the ground (where the pig had died), after we
tied its ankles, I lifted it.’
Note that in example (28) below, only the final verb is marked for its actual
status, irrealis. The preceding verbs are marked as realis even though they have
similar irrealis meaning to the final verb. However the sequential and simultaneous
suffixes mark them as medial (dependent) verbs which take their status from the final
verb.
lai-la-ne-i
gugu
(28) Lulua-lu-ke,
RED.put.P-2S.R-SEQ remain-P.DUR-1/3P.R-SIM hole
pue-po-fwa-le.
dig-DISTR-MOT.AWAY-2S.IR
‘After you have stacked them (posts), then while they’re there, you’ll dig
holes (for putting house posts in).’
The use of aspect in complex sentences is not yet fully understood. In discourse,
it is used for foregrounding and backgrounding events (see §10 ‘Discourse Level’). I160Kwomtari Grammarhave not been able to find a difference in meaning between when -la ‘P.DUR’ is used
in the medial clause and when -me ‘D.DUR’ is used. I assume there is a difference, but
longer exposure to the language would be needed to clarify this. Table 17 shows what
meanings are currently understood to be obtained in complex sentences where the
medial clause has EITHER durative aspect (-la or -me). The first column of the table
gives the status of the whole sentence; the second column gives the final suffix on the
medial clause; the third column shows which type of durative aspect (proximal or
distal) appears on the final clause; the last column gives the understood meaning of
the sentence. Note that M = medial clause, F = final clause.

Logical relationships between clauses are expressed by the conjunctions based on
te ‘FOC’. These conjunctions are used between clauses regardless of whether they
share subjects, and whether they are dependent or independent.
The conjunction tetu ‘then’ (FOC-COM) indicates that the first clause acts as a
stimulus for the second. Its meaning is similar to ‘and with that, …’.","[169, 170, 171]"
"4.1 Verb Stems
4.1.1 Common verb stems
Verbs are formed by adding suffixes to the verb stem. Table 8 lists some common
Kwomtari verb stems; the four verbs on the lefthand side are the most frequently
used, and also function as auxiliary verbs in compound verb constructions (see
discussion below).
TABLE 8: BASIC VERB STEMSle‘do’fie‘hear/ask’a‘do’feta‘see’ne‘say’fo‘eat’la‘remain’lu‘sleep’ri‘come’wa‘go’Examples (1) and (2) show how verb stems take suffixes to form complete verbs:

wa-fe.
1NPL eat-D.DUR-1S.R-SEQ go-1S.IR
‘(In a while,) I’ll eat and then go.’
The distinction between the two verbs glossed ‘do’ (le and a) is not a clear one.
My impression is that le is more transitive (Hopper and Thompson 1980), with the
agent being high in volitionality. This contrasts with a, which is intransitive and has
an agent low in volitionality, as is the case in the following two examples:
(3) Mene fife-le
le-la-ie.
1NPL faeces-GL do-P.DUR-1S.R
‘I’m defecating.’
(4) Gwaie
silu fife
a-la-bile.
cassowary baby faeces do-P.DUR-1/3P.IR
‘The baby cassowaries will be defecating.’
In (3), the actor is human and therefore higher in volitionality than the
cassowaries in (4). In support of this analysis, note that fife ‘faeces’ in (3) takes the
goal suffix -le. In (4) the same word lacks the goal suffix, and so is apparently
partially incorporated in the verb.
The difference in transitivity becomes clearer when used with impersonal
constructions (see §4.1.4). In (5), the hunger is acting on the affected person. In (6),
the hunger is entirely inside the experiencer, and there is nothing acting.
(5) Gife

There are two types of compound verbs:
a. those terminating in one of the four verbs given in the first cell of table 8;
b. those formed with the noun na ‘word’ and a verb stem.","[108, 109]"
"1.3.5 The papers
The following papers on the phonology and grammar of Kwomtari are revised
versions of papers (Drew 1998; Spencer 1998) written by two English women, Julia
Drew and Katharine Spencer, who were recent university graduates. They were
assigned in 1998 to assist an SIL language programme under SIL’s Graduate
International Programme (GRIP). The authors conducted fieldwork while living with
Murray and Carol Honsberger in Baifeni village for 9 weeks, and subsequently wrote
up their findings at the SIL centre at Ukarumpa in the Eastern Highlands. While the
papers are still preliminary work in many ways, their conclusions have been validated
by application in the field, and SIL considers they should be made available to the
wider linguistic world as analysis of a previously undescribed language.
The papers have been edited by permission of the authors, who are no longer
active in Papua New Guinea. In editing the papers, we have attempted to keep a
balance between preserving the integrity of the original documents, and updatingIntroduction15them in the light of ten years’ additional experience of work in the language. Further
examples have been inserted to illustrate points made by the authors, and the text has
been reworded to improve the presentation. In addition, references in the text to other
sources have been updated to the latest edition known, and further cross-references
have been added where it has seemed appropriate. However, no changes have been
made in the analysis unless a major point relevant to the discussion was not covered
in the original paper or where subsequent evidence showed the original analysis
needed to be refined. Where a change in the analysis has been made, it has been
footnoted.","[24, 25]"

Kinship nouns also differ from other nouns in that they are obligatorily possessed.

22.1.3 Adjectives
Identifying a class of adjectives distinct from nouns is problematic. There are
some differences, however. Semantically, nouns are defined by a cluster of
properties. Adjectives have basically one property. They indicate a quality, whereas
quantifiers are a distinct class (discussed in §2.2). As in examples (14) and (15),
specifying nouns always precede the nouns they modify. Adjectives, however, are
found before and after nouns. They generally precede nouns that reference animate
entities and follow all other nouns that they modify; compare (6) to (7), and (8) to (9):

Kwomtari has a marker of focus, te, which most often functions as a conjunction
(see §6.2 for further discussion). This focus marker is the basis for the two most
frequently used demonstratives, which are formed by prefixing ee- or u-. Te marks an
established deictic centre in discourse. With the prefixes ee- and u-, the deictic centre
is the speaker, and the demonstratives formed mark close proximity and distance
respectively.14
Kwomtari has a three-term demonstrative system:
a. eete
‘here: close by’
b. eke
‘there: a bit further away, e.g. out of reach but still in sight’
c. ute
‘over there: further away (yonder)’13
14Free translation in Tok Pisin: Yu yet bai givim long ol susa.
[Editors’ note] These forms provide further evidence for the hypothesis (Dixon 2003: 88-89) that
‘near’ demonstratives are more likely cross-linguistically to involve front high vowels.","[79, 80]"
"68Kwomtari Grammarmore than two in number (example (53)). Possessive and object pronouns are formed
with una regardless of number (examples (54) and (55)). However, una may also be

"4. Phonological processes
4.1 Labialisation
Where /u/ and /u̞/ follow consonants and precede another vowel, they are
commonly desyllabified and realised as labialisation of the preceding consonant.
Examples of labialisation are shown in (1) below.
(1)/takuɔni/[tɐ.kʷɔ.ni]‘floor’/kuɔru/[kʷɔ.ru]‘bow’/makuɔi/[mɐ.kʷɔi]‘type of arrow’/ɡuaiɛ/[ɡʷɐi.jɛ]‘cassowary’/nabui/[nɐ. ͫbʷi]‘blazing’/buaɭi/[bʷɐ.ɭi]‘shell ring money’/ɸui/[ɸʷi]‘coconut’/tiaɸui/[ti.jɐ.βʷi]‘snake’ (generic term)/muamɔɭɛ/[mʷɐ.mɔ.ɭɛ]‘one’In Kwomtari, the most commonly labialised consonants are velar; bilabial
consonants also show examples of labialisation but are less frequently
encountered. This is in accordance with the universal trend for labialisation to
occur most commonly with velars, and somewhat less frequently with bilabials
(Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996:356). There are no examples of labialised
coronal consonants. The examples in (2) below show that coronal consonants are
not subject to labialisation:36Kwomtari Phonology(2)37/tuɔɭu/[tu.wɔ.ɭu]‘egg’/prɔnuɛ/[prɔ.nu.wɛ]‘insert’/kuasuɛ/[kʷɐ.su.wɛ]‘bamboo arrow’/ɭuɛ/[ɭu.wɛ]‘sleep’/tui/[tu.wi]‘prostitute’/aruɛ/[ɐ.ru.wɛ]‘carry’Labialisation also seems to be blocked preceding /ɛ/, as in example (3). It is
unclear why this is the case.
(3)/abuɛ/[ɐ. ͫbu.wɛ]‘grandkin’/puɛ/[pu.wɛ]‘dig’There are two apparent exceptions, shown in (4):
(4)/bubua/[bu.bu.wɐ]‘beat’/ɭəbuɛmu/ (?)[ɭə.bu.wə.mu]‘bone-tipped arrow’In the second example, the phonetic schwa following [u] may be /ɛ/
underlyingly, since /ɛ/ can be reduced to [ə] in any environment. This would
explain why /b/ is not labialised. There are other examples where schwa follows a
labialised consonant, as in (5) below. These examples support the analysis that
schwa is a phoneme in its own right, and not just an allophone of /ɛ/ (refer to
§2.2):
(5)/mɔtukuə/[mɔ.tu.kʷə]‘many’/tɐtukuə/[tɐ.tu.kʷə]‘finish’/rukuə/[ru.kʷə]‘shovel’When our language advisors write words with labialised consonants, they
sometimes write <w>, sometimes <u>, sometimes <o> and sometimes the
labialisation is unmarked. I am not surprised that both <w> and <u> are used; I
suggest that <o> is written when labialisation is caused by /u̞/, rather than /u/.
Labialisation is also often written as <o> before a low vowel, which may suggest
that the position of the lips is more open before low vowels than high vowels. I am
not sure why labialisation sometimes is unwritten, but it is notable that38Kwomtari Phonologylabialisation is always written in words where there is an unlabialised minimal pair
counterpart, as in the case of bali ‘garden’ and bwali ‘shell ring money’.
Labialisation occurs before syllabification. When a non-coronal consonant is
followed by /u/ and then another high vowel (thus a vowel of the same height as
the underlying /u/), labialisation occurs first, and then syllabification. This ensures
that the two vowels remain part of the same syllable despite being the same
height. For example:
(6)/mui/[mʷi]‘salt’/ɸui/[ɸʷi]‘coconut’Both these words are monosyllabic. The same is also true of all words in
which [w] is clearly derived from labialisation of [u] in a component morpheme,
even those where the vowel following the /w/ is considerably lower. This supports
the analysis that /u/ becomes a semi-vowel – taking on consonantal characteristics
– in this environment. Semi-vowels will be discussed in more detail in §4.3.","[45, 46, 47, 48]"
