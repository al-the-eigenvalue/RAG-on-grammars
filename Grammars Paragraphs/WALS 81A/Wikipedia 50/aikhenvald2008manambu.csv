"20.1 Major constituents533Another option is to cross-reference the experiencer on the verb—then the experiencer has
to be overtly stated, as in 20.66. The experiencer is highly topical: the hawk is stressing the
diﬃculty he has in entering the house without a key:
20.66 [wiya:r
wula-wula:k] [suan
yi-na-d@wun-@k]
house+lk+all enter-red+dat diﬃcult go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘It is diﬃcult for me to enter the house’ (lit. I am diﬃcult to enter the house)
Such a topical experiencer has yet another crucial subject property: it controls switchreference. In 20.67, the same person experienced diﬃculties in talking and got into the hands
of an evil man:
20.67 [wun yi-y@
suan
yi-ku]
[kuprap-@ du taba:r
I
talk-red diﬃcult go-compl.ss bad-lk
man hand+lk+all
wula-lwun-@k]
enter-1fem.sgbas.p-conf
‘As it was diﬃcult for me to talk (lit. as I was diﬃcult to talk), I got into the hands of a
bad man’
Neither body part constructions, nor copula clauses or impersonal constructions, can form
imperatives or reﬂexives, or be used in constructions with modal verbs—which means that
these universal criteria for subjecthood are not applicable here.
Bodily and mental processes in Papuan languages are very often expressed with ‘impersonal’
constructions, which are problematic with respect to their subjecthood. The title of Pawley, Gi,
Majnep, and Kias’s (2000) ‘Hunger acts on me . . . ’ speaks for itself: the problems we have
just addressed for Manambu are pervasive in the whole area—also see Pawley (forthcoming),
Roberts (2001), and Priestley (2002). Compared to other Papuan languages, body part and
impersonal constructions in Manambu are fairly limited. And the experiencer is never marked
as an object. There is also a strong correlation between the topicality of an experiencer and its
potential subjecthood.
We conclude that in all such constructions in Manambu the topical participant has the
formal properties of a subject. This is congruent with the idea that subjects tend to be
grammaticalized topics (see, for instance, Keenan 1987: 103–4; and discussion in Dixon 1994:
11–30). It is interesting to note that subjecthood and topicality are closely intertwined just
in this instance, so much so that one is tempted to say that subjecthood in body part and
impersonal constructions is determined entirely by pragmatics.
Verbless clauses are also potentially problematic in terms of how their subjects are to
be identiﬁed. Clauses with non-verbal predicates other than adverbial and reactivated topic
demonstratives are pretty straightforward in this respect: we recall, from §20.1.3 above, that
their subject is cross-referenced on the predicate itself with cross-referencing enclitics. When
used in dependent clauses, non-verbal predicates have to be used with a support verb which
then also cross-references the subject constituent.
But verbless clauses and clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives have no
subject cross-referencing. Neither can they be used in dependent clauses.
Since the predicate is marked with the suﬃx -n- in both clauses with adverbial and reactivated
topic demonstratives (see 20.52b), the other obligatory constituent can be safely identiﬁed
with the subject. This other constituent—e.g. ‘food’ in 20.52b—triggers gender and number
agreement on the demonstrative in the predicate slot, which makes it similar to a subject
(A/S). The order of constituents is ﬁxed: the predicate always comes last. We thus conclude
that the non-predicate noun phrase in non-verbal clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic53420 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesdemonstratives as predicates is subject-like enough to be considered on a par with other
subjects.
The situation in verbless clauses is less clear. In clauses of the naming type, there is semantic
agreement between the ﬁrst and the second noun phrase. The order is ﬁxed; and the choice
of the second NP depends on the ﬁrst. And if a ‘naming’ verbless clause is rephrased as a
non-verbal clause, the ‘name’ is in the predicate slot and the person named is the subject. This
allows us to hypothesize that the ‘name’ occupies the predicate slot, and the person named is
the subject.
The same line of argument holds for verbless clauses with a reactivated topic demonstrative
in the second position—such as 20.52a. There is also some grammatical agreement between the
two constituents: so, in a verbless clause apawul ada (spirit dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg) ‘that
is a (masculine) spirit’ the masculine form is determined by the ﬁrst noun phrase. We can thus
suggest that the ﬁrst noun phrase is subject-like, and the second is not. Following the principles
of analogy with similar clauses, we can stipulate that the question word heads the predicate in
20.54, 10.98, 10.100–2. The situation with verbless clauses of other subtypes is just as murky:
the notion of subject does not appear to be applicable at all to the one-word clauses like those
in 20.53a and 20.55.
The category of a syntactic subject—A and S—is highly relevant for Manambu (despite its
limited applicability to verbless clauses). What about other grammatical relations?
B. The category of object (O). We saw in §7.3 that the direct object (O) is often marked with
accusative case. An O can also be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position—see
§3.1—and it can be referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative (§3.3 and §10.2.3). The
O is added to an intransitive verb as a result of applying the morphological causative kay- (see
§16.2.1). But while accusative marking is just about exclusive to a direct object, the other two
properties are not. In particular, any non-subject constituent—with the exception of speech
reports and copula complements—can be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position,
provided it is topical. Then, an ‘object’ is just a part of a more general category which can
be negatively deﬁned as ‘non-subject’. This ‘non-subject’ shares a number of properties with
S—the subject of an intransitive verb: see below.
C. Linking together S, O, and ‘non-subjects’. All or most languages of the world display a
number of links between S (= subject of an intransitive verb) and O (= object of a transitive
verb) (see Dixon 1994: 55; and Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). These links have nothing
whatever to do with ergativity of any kind. They are expected to be found in languages
with every pattern of syntactic and morphological alignment—that is, nominative/accusative,
absolutive/ergative, and so on. So, if a language marks quantiﬁcation on verbs, it is highly likely
that the number expressed will be that of S or O. And this is indeed the case with the marker of
complete involvement -tu- (see §12.4), e.g. kiya-tu-di (die-many-3plbas.p) ‘TheyS all died’ and
vya-tu-di (kill-many-3plbas.p) ‘They killed (all) of themo (all over the place)’; and not ∗ They
(all) killed them’ (see 12.22–4 and 12.72).
Besides this expected correlation between S and O, Manambu has a number of less obvious
ones. We saw in §3.3 and then in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives can only refer to
an S, or an O, or, somewhat more rarely, to another non-subject participant—for instance,
recipient, location, and time. (That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis
is hardly surprising—in Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal
demonstrative may only occur in S or O function which is the pivot function in Dyirbal: Dixon
2003: 83, 94–9.) These non-subject participants are the ones cross-referenced on the second
position—provided they are topical.","[559, 560, 561]"
"20.2 Constituent order535This S/O, or, better, non-A, basis for reactivated topic markers has a pragmatic basis. It
agrees with a cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the non-A function (typically,
an S/O function) and introducing a new participant (Du Bois 1987). To put it simply: new
participants tend to be introduced in S/O function, but hardly ever in the A function.
This principle in Manambu has interesting repercussions for the variations in constituent
order, and for the highlighting focus construction. There is a strong preference for non-As to
occur in a postverbal position reserved for unexpected and relatively new information and clariﬁcation (see §20.2). An A constituent hardly ever occurs in highlighting focus constructions
reserved for new information (see §20.3).20.2 c o n s t i t u e n t o r d e r: i t s s y n tac t i c a n d p rag m at i c m o t i vat i o n s
Constituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb ﬁnal in main clauses, and almost exclusively so in dependent clauses (see Tables 19.1 and 20.1). This is consistent with a verb-ﬁnal
tendency advocated as typical of languages with clause chaining and switch-reference.
However, this is not a steadfast rule. One Sunday in early 2002 Ken Nayau, the major
consultant working with SIL missionaries Robin and Marva Farnsworth, was visiting his native
Avatip. He burst into Yuamali’s house where we were having a mid-afternoon snack to ask me
an urgent question: ‘What is a verb-ﬁnal order?’ I explained, using a mixture of Manambu,
Tok Pisin, and English, what this is supposed to mean (it is not an easy task to say ‘verb’ in
Manambu, or to talk about linguistics in general). ‘You put your verb at the end of what you
say.’ ‘Yes’, replied Ken, ‘this is what Robin told me it means. But we do not speak like that.’
And indeed, not all clauses in Manambu end with a verb. (In the corpus, about 15–20
per cent do not.) There are a number of principles which allow for non-verb-ﬁnal orders in
the language.
The general principle of ordering words and constituents in Manambu involves placing new
and less topically established participants ﬁrst. Participants tend to be introduced as O (as can
be seen in T1.1 and T2.1), or in a verbless clause (as in T1.3 which may be translated as ‘(There
was) a young man and a woman’), or as an S of a non-verbal clause (as in T2.3). In a transitive
clause, the order is typically AOV, as in 20.68a. An overt A does not have to be expressed at
all; but it is likelier to be expressed if the predicate is a non-inﬂecting verb as in 20.68a–b (also
see 7.5).
20.68a wun m@n-a:m
vi
ma:
I
you.masc-lk+acc/loc hit+neg neg
‘I will not hit you’
An OAV order implies that the O is contrastive, new, and unexpected, as in 20.68b:
ma:
20.68b m@n-a:m
wun vi
you.masc-lk+acc/loc I
hit+neg neg
‘I will not hit you’ (implying that I may hit someone else)
Placing an O before an A is so unusual that if the clause is to be repeated in a ‘head-tail’
bridging structure (see §20.4), the A is also repeated. Note that the O is not case marked,
despite being a personal name: this O is a new participant never mentioned in the story again,
and case marking is associated with topicality—see §7.3.","[561, 562]"

‘Having taken his children, having entered (the battleﬁeld), Iraman hit Apur (not anyone

A conventional way of marking ‘head-tail’ bridging linkage would have been to say vyad@-d vya-d@-k (hit-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p hit-3masc.sg-compl.ds), literally, ‘he hit him,
having hit’ (see §20.4.1). But since there is potential ambiguity as to who did the hitting and
who was hit, ‘Iraman’ is repeated again.
A fronted O in OAV clauses often appears in a highlighting focus construction:

we-lk-masc.sg child marry-impv.3p-masc.sg
‘That is why it is this woman down there (that) he this son of ours may marry’
Obliques also tend to be placed at the beginning of the clause if contrastive—see further
discussion in §20.3.
The postverbal position is reserved for noun phrases, or sometimes parts thereof, which
provide unexpected supplementary information which is partly new and partly conﬁrms what
we already know. We saw in 20.20 that a numeral can be extracted from a noun phrase
postposed to the verb: in this case it emphasizes the ‘togetherness’ of the action.
Only a small fraction of such postverbal elements are separated from the verb with a pause,
as one would have expected if it had been an afterthought. Consider 20.16: the woman did not
bring water even for her own child, and this latter, oblique constituent, is postposed to the verb,
as surprising information. This information is not fully new—we already know that the child
accompanied her, and that she did not bother to bring either food or water for either of them.
The postverbal position for the beneﬁciary, the child, stresses how remiss she was.
Similarly, in 20.6, the speaker reintroduces his ancestor in S function as the one who was
looking around. A similar example is 13.56: the comitative ‘with them’ is supplied after the
verb because it is unexpected, and needs to be reiterated. In T1.16, the S is postposed to
the imperative form since it is conceived as a means of ‘chasing away’ an unexpected guest.
And in T2.16 the tree ﬁnally falls down—this unexpected and surpising result is expressed via
postposing the S to the verb. A similar example is at 20.71—a command by a mother to her
daughter urging her to be less greedy and share some of the tiny Malay apples with her baby
sister:
20.71 l@-k@-k
akui
mugul-a-jagw@s
she-obl-dat impv+give.to.third.p three/few-lk-tiny.Malay.apple
‘Give her (guess what) a few tiny Malay apples!’ (something you do not expect to give
her)20.2 Constituent order537A postverbal oblique often has a similar function, as in 10.3, 20.3 (‘to her’), and 20.72 (where
the postverbal noun phrase contains a relative clause). We already know where the mother and
her brother had gone; that the child decides to follow them right there is unexpected.
20.72 kwap@k ada

tamiya:k]
mother’s.brother go-3dubas.p+lk area+lk+dat
‘Next day he (child) went (guess where) to the area where mother and uncle had gone’
As a result of this unexpected turn of events, the child discovers the existence of yams—
this is the beginning of the story about the origin of yams. A similar example is at T3.26—the
snake’s entering the house (postposed to the verb) is unexpected: snakes are not supposed to
enter houses.
Alternatively, a postverbal NP may provide additional clariﬁcation, as in 20.8: the speaker
wanted to make sure the audience understands exactly who went up the river. A similar
example is at 20.73: the postverbal oblique makes it clear that the speaker is urging his sister to
return to the house:
20.73 s@b@n@n
yi-t@k
wiya:r
return+seq go-1duimpv house+lk+all
‘Let’s go back, (that is) home’
When a little boy got drowned in the village, the whole family was involved in mourning him;
20.74a speciﬁes that his mother was also among those who cried at that time:
20.74a [ata wuk@-ku]
[gra-dian
d@-k@
amæy wuk@n]
then hear-compl.ss cry-1plbas.p he-obl+3fem.sg mother with
‘Then having heard (the news) we cried together with his mother’
Similarly, in T2.59 the possessor in a non-verbal possessive clause is postposed to the
predicate, as a means of clariﬁcation. An NP which provides clariﬁcation is more likely to
be separated from the rest of the clause with a pause than an NP which supplies unexpected
information. An example of a clarifying afterthought is at T3.41.
Not every syntactic function allows for a postverbal position with equal ease. The number
of transitive subjects in this position is remarkably limited. One such rare example is at 20.74b.
The participant sucking the breast was—according to the speaker—a rather unexpected one:
20.74b a
ta:kw m@ñ ka:d
a-d@
wa:j
dem.dist.fem.sg woman breast eat+3masc.sgbas.p dem.dist-masc.sg eel
‘That eel (guess who!) was sucking that woman’s breast’
Another example is in the last clause of 16.29. This is an example of clariﬁcation stating exactly
which members of the opposite clan group (that is, the wife’s relatives) were conducting a
debate about the man’s mortuary festival.
Two noun phrases can be postposed to the verb, albeit rarely. In 20.75a two NPs (an oblique
and an S) clarify a statement which would otherwise have appeared obscure. The adverb
‘already’ is also postposed to the verb—this emphasizes the unexpectedness of the fact that
the plane (and Jager with it) is already going away, in the direction of Wewak:
b@
Wewak-a:r
Jag@r
20.75a væki-na-d
go.across-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt already Wewak-lk+all Jager
‘Jager is already going across to Wewak!’ (lit. (He) is already (surprise!) going across to
Wewak Jager)53820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesThe English translation presents this clause as if it contained afterthoughts—the Manambu
clause does not, because there are no pauses intervening between the constituents.
A rare example of VOA order is at 20.75b: that I (the addressee) had not yet had the chance
to go to the market and see Walinum (‘her’) again was surprising to the speaker:
20.75b ma: n@bay v@
l@-k@-m
ñ@n
neg yet
see+neg she-obl-acc/loc you.fem
‘You (not anyone else: surprise) haven’t yet seen (guess who) her’
An unusual constituent order, such as OVAO in 20.76, tends to involve repetition of one of
the constituents. In 20.76, bal ‘pig’ (O) is repeated twice: once before and once after the verb:
20.76 [abra
{war-b@r]
[war-ku]}
[balO
dem.dist.react.top+du go.up-3dubas.p go.up-compl.ss pig

[p@takaum kwa-d-@
bal]O
ladder+loc stay-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk pig
‘The two went up, having gone up; killed the pig mother (and) father the pig that was
on the ladder’
The second postposed constituent can be an afterthought, as in 20.77. It is separated from
the rest of the clause by a pause:
20.77 [a-d@
wi
ada
yi:n
dem.dist-masc.sg house dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+seq

show-go-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p man-lk-child pause dem.dist-pl room-too
‘The boy (guess who) kept on showing that house on and on, those rooms too’
Speakers vary as to the frequency of postposed NPs and adverbs. Postposition for clariﬁcation purposes is more frequent with older women as story tellers, accustomed to explaining
and spelling out things for their grandchildren as their audience. During my ﬁrst stay at Avatip,
speakers such as Yipawal, Yuawalup, and the late Wimali would use such postposed noun
phrases (S, O, obliques, and even As) with much more frequency than later on, after I’d become
much less of a novice (or a novelty), and was expected to understand a story like any other
adult.
Postposing an NP to the verb in a command may have additional repercussions to do with
its illocutionary force. This is shown in the three contrasting examples below. In 20.78a, the
mother tells the elder child to give a doll to a younger child who is crying:
20.78a dolly nak l@-k@-k
akui
dolly one she-obl-dat impv+give.to.third.p
‘Give her one dolly!’
The elder girl ignores the command, and the younger child continues crying. The mother,
mildly annoyed, repeats the command as 20.78b:
l@-k@-k
20.78b dolly nak akui
dolly one impv+give.to.third.p she-obl-dat
‘Give her one dolly’ (lit. one dolly give to her)
The girl ignores it again, and the younger child cries more and more. The mother shouts:20.2 Constituent order53920.78c akui
pause dolly nak l@-k@-k
impv+give.to.third.p pause dolly one she-obl-dat
‘Give her one dolly!!!’ (Give (pause) one dolly to her)
In this last example, the noun phrases are separated from the verb with a short pause.
However, it appears counterintuitive to treat them as ‘afterthoughts’—rather, the mother sets
the NPs oﬀ from the verb as a way of reminding the naughty girl what she is to do, unless she
wants to face the consequences. (The child did not, and opted to run away.)
Order within dependent clauses tends to be verb ﬁnal. However, there are exceptions—as in
T1.3, and 20.79. These exceptions serve a didactic purpose—that of reminding the audience of
an S, or an O, or an oblique (but hardly ever an A). The man was mentioned a few lines before;
so the speaker chose to repeat a reference to him, just in case:
20.79 [v@-k@tak@p t@-ku
du-a:k]
[adiya
s@b@nadi]
see-fr
‘stand’-compl.ss man-lk+dat dem.dist.react.top+pl return+3plbas.p
‘Having tried to see the man in vain, they returned’
There is never any pause between the predicate of the dependent clause and the postposed NP.
A dependent clause can be postposed to the main clause, as a means of providing supplementary information, as in 14.115, 14.116, and T1.34. This information is not new—the function of
a postposed dependent clause is to remind the listener of something they are already supposed
to know. Consider T1.34: all the postposed medial completive clause tells us is that the main
character was married—something we have known from the very start of the story.
A similar example is at 20.80. The girl is very angry with her uncle who had mistreated her
in the past. This is what the preceding paragraph is about. The uncle understands this and says
to the girl’s brother (for whom the fact that the girl is angry is also no news):
20.80 [l@ [l@-k@

dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg I-lk+dat be.angry-compl.ss
‘She is in the place where she sleeps, having got angry at me’
A dependent medial clause postposed to the main clause with same-subject marking may
have a recapitulative function. Then they form one intonation unit. Examples are in 18.19 and
18.28, 20.76, T2.23, and the penultimate clause of T2.40. We saw, in §19.5, that such recapitulating constructions are particularly frequent in speech reports, as in 19.74. An additional
function of this is to stress that a speech act actually took place: speech report constructions
in Manambu are used in a wide variety of meanings not all of which involve a speech act.
Alternatively, the same-subject form of the verb t@- ‘stand, be’ can be used in the meaning of
‘after that’, literally, ‘having been (like that)’, as in 18.24 and 18.28, and T2.62.
We saw in §13.7, and especially examples such as 13.79–81 and 20.64, that a dative-aversive
marked nominalization can precede or follow the main (inﬂected) verb. A postverbal position
is reserved for an unexpected piece of information, as in 13.82 (people are normally not afraid
of going into a house).
The position of the reactivated topic demonstrative aka (dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg) before
or after the verb depends on what the demonstrative refers to. If it refers to a participant
(typically in S, O or oblique function), it precedes the verb, as in 10.41 and T2.1. If it refers to
the action itself, it can be placed either before or after the verb.
It appears after the verb if the whole action and its extent is somewhat unexpected. Consider
the ﬁnal lines of the three texts: in T2.69, aka precedes the verb, and in T1.35 and T3.53 it54020 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesfollows. In the latter instances, the end of a story is stated as being ‘that topical one’: neither
story is a traditional one, and consequently does not have an ending that everyone would be
aware of. In contrast, T2.69 is the ending of a traditional story which ﬁnishes in due course;
and so aka precedes the verb. Along similar lines, in the ﬁrst clause in 20.80 the fact that the
girl is sleeping in her house and her uncle is left outside is somewhat unexpected and contrary
to convention—this explains the postverbal position of aka.
In summary: constituent order in Manambu is both syntactically and pragmatically based.
In particular, the fact that A (transitive subject) hardly ever appears postposed to the verb
reﬂects its pragmatic function closely associated with its syntactic role.
We will see, in §20.4.1 (example 20.90) that having a non-verb-ﬁnal constituent order does
not aﬀect the basics of ‘head-tail’ linkage between sentences.20.3 highlighting fo cus constructions
Highlighting focus constructions (mentioned in §3.1 and then in §11.1.1, and example 11.8)
involve marking a noun phrase or a fully inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate,
in order to contrast it with another constituent, or another clause. A noun phrase or a
verbal form in highlighting focus takes nominal cross-referencing enclitics. Gender and number
speciﬁcations agree with the head of predicate. That is, if the predicate head is masculine
singular, as in the ﬁrst clause in 20.81, cross-referencing is masculine singular. And if the
predicate head is feminine singular, so is the cross-referencing, as in the second clause in
20.81. If the whole inﬂected verb is in highlighting focus (examples 20.87–8), the agreement
is third person feminine singular; this is in line with this being the least functionally marked
choice. Highlighting focus constructions are highly frequent in conversations and narratives.
They involve contrasting a constituent to another constituent; or ‘stressing’ a constituent as
important for the discourse.
As mentioned in §20.1.1, parts of a noun phrase cannot be focused independently: only an
NP as a whole can. The same principle applies to complex predicates. A clause cannot contain
two constituents each in a focus construction. A constituent in focus tends to occupy a clauseinitial position.
A highlighting focus construction does not appear to produce a cleft sentence: the nonfocused part of the clause has the make-up of an independent clause. We would expect a cleft
to split a clause into two clauses: one copula-like, and the other marked as a relative clause (see
Matthews 1997). We return to this issue further below.
There is no intonation break or pause between the form in highlighting focus, which has to
obligatorily precede the predicate. A story or a conversation never starts with a highlighting
focus simply because a highlighting focus implies contrast to something previously mentioned.
A constituent in highlighting focus does not have to be deﬁnite; but it has to have been
mentioned previously in discourse.
Highlighting focus overwhelmingly involves S (intransitive subject), as in T1.3, T1.13,
penultimate clause of T3.16, T3.25, and 20.81, or the object, as in T2.59, T3.3, and 20.82.
Constituents in highlighting focus are in braces, and so are their translations into English:
r@-kwa-na-d]
20.81 [{j@pwas-ad}
t@k@r-@m

stool’ (lit. {It is an initiated man} used to sit on a stool,{it is a woman} there is no
sitting on a stool)
An object in highlighting focus construction is never case marked. This is in line with
the semantics of object case marking (see §7.3): only deﬁnite and topical, rather than focal,
objects are case marked. This also agrees with a general tendency of not having case-marked
constituents in the highlighting focus constructions.

man he-obl-masc.sg meat-3masc.sgnom eat-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p

The S of a non-verbal clause can be in highlighting focus, as in T1.7 (‘as for this one’), T2.27
(ka ‘this is it (that I am)’), T3.40 (kad b@ numa-d@ ga:n-ad ‘this is that it is a big masculine
night’) and 20.83.
20.83 {a-d@

kabay-ad
dem.dist-masc.sg spirit-3masc.sgnom snake-3masc.sgnom
‘{It is that spirit} (who) is a snake’ (lit. {It is a spirit} is a snake)
So can a time adverb as in T3.42 (‘today’), and an addressee, as in 20.84.
20.84 {a-d@

wa-ñ@na-d
dem.dist-masc.sg Kainu-3masc.sgnom say-2fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘{It is that Kainu} (that) you spoke to’ (lit. {it is that Kainu} you spoke to)
If a location or an instrument is focused, it tends to appear without any case marking, as in
20.85a (this is also a possible alternative interpretation for the ﬁrst clause of T2.8). A rare
example of a case-marked oblique in highlighting focus is at 20.85b.
20.85a {gu-a}

‘{It is to water} (that) they came’
20.85b wiyar-a
yi-na-di
house+lk+all-3fem.sgnom go-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘{It is to the house} (that) they went’
We mentioned in §10.2.2 that ata ‘thus’ has a predicative focus form ata-n, e.g. ata-n au (thuspred impv+talk) ‘speak now’ (lit. ‘it is now that you are commanded to speak’). This marker
also appears when ata heads the predicate (see §20.1.3). An example of ata in a highlighting
focus construction is at 20.86 (the O, ‘ceremony’, is postposed to the verb as a clariﬁcation).
20.86 {ata-n-adi}
t@-da-di
ba:gw
thus-pred-3plnom have-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p ceremony
‘{This was the way} they had ceremonies’ (lit. {Thus was} they had (what we already
know, that is) ceremonies)
A constituent within a dependent clause can rarely occur in a highlighting focus construction
unless there is a break (a rare example is at T2.35). A dependent clause (except for an -n-marked
sequential clause) cannot be in highlighting focus.","[562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568]"

This grammar has been written as an integrated whole. To understand what follows one needs
to have digested what precedes. Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the main points of the
Manambu grammar. Later chapters deal with a particular grammatical topic each.
Chapter 3 discusses the ways in which grammatical relations are expressed. This chapter
is basic for understanding the rest of the grammar. Chapter 2 contains a detailed discussion
of phonology; it is not necessary to read to understand the rest of the grammar. Chapter 4
gives an overview of all the word classes, and Chapter 11 concentrates on the organization
of verbal morphology, giving a preview of Chapters 12–17. Chapters 18 and 19 deal with
complex clauses. Chapter 20 draws together the structure of clausal constituents, clauses, and
sentences, and discusses the principles and functions of constituent order and of order of
grammatical words within each constituent. Issues in semantics are addressed in Chapter 21.
Those interested in cultural background and historical and comparative problems are advised
to focus on Chapters 1 and 22.
Examples are numbered separately for each chapter. Examples from texts at the end of the
grammar are referred to with the letter T followed by the number of the text and the sentence
(that is, T2.40 refers to sentence 40 of Text 2).
All the examples and texts are supplied with an interlinear morpheme gloss, and then translated into English. Homophonous morphemes are diﬀerentiated by their glosses. The symbol
‘+’ is used to indicate fused morphemes, e.g. taba- is glossed as ‘hand+lk’, its underlying form
being ta:b ‘hand’ (with the long vowel shortened when the linker is added) and -a- ‘linker’.
Portmanteau morphemes are glossed with ‘:’, for instance, mæy ‘come:impv’. All grammatical
morphemes are glossed in small caps while lexical morphemes are in lower case. Pronominal
preﬁxes are shown as 1sg, 3pl, in lower case. For polysemous morphemes, diﬀerent translations
in glosses correspond to diﬀerent meanings.
Cross-references are of two kinds:
r Those preceded by § refer to chapter and section number: for instance, §11.1 refers to
section 1 of Chapter 11;
r Those beginning with a number refer to examples in the grammar: for instance, 11.1 refers
to example 1 in Chapter 11.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

Introduction: The Language and its Speakers
Manambu belongs to the Ndu language family, and is spoken by about 2,500 people in
ﬁve villages: Avatip, Yawabak, Malu, Apa:n, and Yambon (Yuanab) in East Sepik Province,
Ambunti district. About 200–400 speakers live in the cities of Port Moresby, Wewak, Lae, and
Madang; a few people live in Kokopo and Mount Hagen.1.1 l i n g u i s t i c ty p e
Manambu is synthetic, with elements of fusion, and predominantly suﬃxing. The imperative
marker a- is the only fully productive preﬁx (§13.2.1), while the causative-manipulative preﬁx
kay- occurs with a limited number of verbs (§16.2.1). The inﬁx -ka- marks intensive forms of
non-agreeing adjectives (§4.3).
Manambu has twenty consonants and nine vowels. There is a series of simple voiced and
voiceless bilabial, apico-dental, and dorso-velar stops (just like in other Ndu languages). Voiced
and voiceless bilabial and dorso-velar stops also have a labialized counterpart. All the voiced
stops and the voiced fricative j are prenasalized in word-initial, intervocalic, and word-ﬁnal
positions. Vowel length is contrastive. Long vowels a: and æ: are a recent innovation: older
speakers still pronounce these as sequences of identical short vowels interrupted by a glottal
stop. Syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C). Stress is movable and contrastive. Long vowels tend to
be stressed (Chapter 2).
Open classes are nouns and verbs. Nominal categories include case, three numbers, and two
genders in the singular. Grammatical relations are expressed with verbal cross-referencing and
with nominal case marking. Manambu has nine case forms, more than any other Ndu language. The subject case is formally unmarked. The same form marks locative and a deﬁnite and
fully involved object. Another form expresses direction and instrument. The dative case marks
beneﬁciary and maleﬁciary, and also has an aversive meaning, ‘for fear of’. The terminative
case means ‘on the very edge of’, and ‘up until’. Two cases mark ‘means of transportation’.
The substitutive case means ‘instead of’. The comitative case meaning ‘together with’ is
a major device for coordinating noun phrases. Its additional meanings are locative ‘along
(e.g. a road)’ and temporal ‘while’. Case markers may attach to verbal roots: the objectivelocative case marks completive aspect, dative case marks purpose, instrumental case derives
deverbal adverbs, and substitutive case marks dependent clauses meaning ‘instead of doing
something’.
Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing fused with tense, aspect, mood
(imperative-permissive, and irrealis), and modalities (optative, purposive, desiderative, and two
frustratives). The subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced on the verb. A second argument—
direct object, beneﬁciary, location, time, manner, or instrument—can be cross-referenced if
it is more topical than the subject. A copula complement, a speech report, and a comitative constituent are never cross-referenced. Members of word classes other than verbs take21 Introductioncross-referencing enclitics when they occupy the predicate slot (Chapters 3–4). This is unlike
most other Ndu languages which cross-reference only the subject.
A small closed class of agreeing adjectives has three members, ‘big’, ‘small’, and ‘ﬁne’; these
agree in gender and number with the head noun. About sixteen non-agreeing adjectives—
which cover semantic types such as value, dimension, colour, and age—share a number of
properties with nouns. Adverbs and time words are semi-closed classes which share a few
properties with nouns. Word class-changing derivations are limited.
A striking property of Manambu is its gender system. Two genders, masculine and feminine,
are assigned to nouns according to their referents’ sex and also shape and size. That is, a
large house is masculine, and a small house feminine. Genders are covert in the sense that,
rather than being marked on the noun itself, they appear on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and adverbial demonstratives, and in possessive constructions. The feminine gender is both
formally and functionally unmarked (Chapter 5).
Three numbers—singular, dual, and plural—are marked on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and in possessive constructions. Plural and dual are marked on most kinship terms and on
a few nouns with a human referent. Associative non-singular (X and his/her associates) is
restricted to just personal names (Chapter 6). The choice between ﬁve types of possessive
construction depends on the type of possessive relationship, of possessee, and of possessor
(Chapter 8).
The system of demonstratives is unusually intricate. Three demonstrative roots, k@‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa- ‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and
a- ‘distal demonstrative’, are used in nominal demonstratives, in manner adverbial demonstratives, and in reactivated topic demonstratives. Nominal demonstratives express either spatiotemporal deixis or ‘current relevance’. The latter are derived from the former with the suﬃx
-na- ‘current relevance’, indicating that the object of pointing is being talked about, or is of
immediate or ongoing importance to the speakers. Spatio-temporal demonstratives distinguish
gender and number, and may also distinguish either three additional degrees of distance, or
ﬁve directions. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish ﬁve directions, and two additional degrees of distance, but no number or gender. Reactivated topic demonstratives refer
predominantly to an S/O constituent (Chapter 10).
Negation is marked diﬀerently depending on aspect, tense, mood, and modality. Nonhabitual negative indicative clauses have no person marking. All dependent clauses are negated
diﬀerently from main clauses. Three prohibitives diﬀer in their illocutionary force.
Manambu has a productive system of verbal compounds (they can be alternatively analysed
as one-word serial verbs: Chapter 15). They express manner, aspectual and sequential meanings, and function as valency-changing devices. Many are lexicalized and have idiomatic
meanings.
Verbs divide into several subclasses depending on whether they can occur with directional
markers, and which directional markers they occur with. Inherently directional verbs
include the six basic verbs war- ‘go upwards’, da- ‘go downwards’, væki- ‘go across (away from
the speaker)’, væra- ‘go across (towards speaker)’, wula- ‘enter, come in, come in a direction
from the Sepik River’, and waku- ‘go out (including motion in direction away from the Sepik
River)’. These do not take any further directional speciﬁcations. Their roots are the base
for directional markers on other verbs, and on demonstratives. Intrinsically directional
verbs include four roots which must take directional suﬃxes, each of which corresponds
to an inherently directional verb. The majority of verbs are optionally directional. They
combine with bound forms consisting of s@- followed by a directional marker. Copula verbs,1.1 Linguistic type3the general motion verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’, and ingestive and stative verbs do not combine
with any directionals. Directionals also have a valency-increasing eﬀect. Directionals on verbs
and on demonstratives have similar origins, but display subtle diﬀerences in their semantics
(Chapter 16).
Manambu has a semi-productive causative-manipulative preﬁx kay- which causativizes a
limited set of intransitive verbs. When applied to transitive verbs, it indicates a special physical
eﬀort and the intensity of action. There is no passive. Instead, Manambu employs transitivityneutralizing constructions which involve clause chaining, and are ambiguous as to their status
as biclausal or as monoclausal. A reciprocal marker awarwa has an associative meaning
‘together with’. Reﬂexive meanings are expressed with a variety of means none of which
involves a verbal derivation (§16.2).
Ten polyfunctional verbs can each be used as an auxiliary or as a support verb, and also
as a copula verb (Table 4.1, and Chapter 17). Auxiliary verb constructions express aspectual,
positional, and modal meanings. There are also a variety of idiomatic complex predicates. Body
part constructions—expressing emotional, mental, and physical states—are a special subtype
thereof.
Clause linking in Manambu is achieved through a variety of means. The major strategy is
clause chaining via medial dependent clauses. In most cases this involves switch-reference (that
is, marking of dependent clauses may be sensitive to whether their subject (A/S) is the same as
that of the following clause or not). The tense and extent of action expressed in a medial clause
is determined by its relationship to the action of a subsequent dependent clause or a main
clause. There are also causal clauses, and ‘unlikely condition’ clauses. Other clause-linking
devices include juxtaposition of a dependent clause and a main clause (this is a preferred
manner of indicating conditional meanings); clause linking via a case marker ‘instead’ and
a suﬃx ‘like’, and clause linking involving connectives.
Relative clauses are similar to main clauses in most properties; they are negated like dependent clauses. Speech reports—direct, indirect, and ‘semi-direct’—are highly frequent. They
express a wide variety of meanings, including desire, fear, and reason. Manambu has no
complement clauses as a special clause type; instead, medial and other dependent clauses are
co-opted as complementation strategies (Chapters 18 and 19).
Constituent order in Manambu tends to be verb ﬁnal. It is often motivated by discourse
pragmatics. Word order within constituents depends on their type. For instance, quantiﬁers
can precede the noun head or follow it depending on the referent’s topicality. Chapter 20
oﬀers a comprehensive analysis of the principles of ordering words and constituents, and also
of the structure of constituents, and of clauses. An argument, or the predicate, can occur
in a highlighting focus construction. A focused constituent appears marked as a non-verbal
predicate head with the appropriate person markers, and the rest of the clause remains as it
was. Highlighting focus constructions may appear biclausal. A focused noun phrase has the
makings of a full verbless clause, since it contains the non-verbal cross-referencing markers.
However, it is not a full clause because it cannot be negated separately. Highlighting focus
constructions are an instance of grammar-in-the-making, similar to transitivity-neutralizing
constructions involving clause chaining (§19.9 and §20.3).
Manambu has a highly elaborate verbal and nominal lexicon. Typologically unusual semantic groups of verbs cover eating, drinking, and chewing, perception, and speech. Highly speciﬁc
terms coexist with highly generalized ones. A general noun ma:gw ‘whatever, whatchamacallit’
and a general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’ are an option, if one cannot think of the right term, or
prefers to be non-speciﬁc. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—tantamount to monetary41 Introductionriches—is viewed in terms of lexicon, especially the totemic names (which are nouns). The
issue of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). Multiple
‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—result in multiple synonymy. The totemic names
are used as address terms, as an integral part of Manambu speech etiquette, where the traditional patterns coexist with newly acquired Western imports.
In terms of the etymological make-up of its lexicon and grammar, Manambu is a central
member of the Ndu family. There are a number of loans from other languages of the area,
mostly Western Iatmul. Similarities between Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma are
contact induced. All the speakers of Manambu are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and many also
in English, and code-switching is pervasive. Signs of incipient language obsolescence look
ominous—however, a strong opposition to language loss gives room to hope that the language
will live.1.2 t he manambu: t h e p r e s e n t a n d t h e pa s t
The Manambu occupy ﬁve villages in the Ambunti District in the East Sepik Province
of Papua New Guinea (see Map). They live mostly on the Sepik River (Manambu ñab,
cf. Kwoma nabagey 1 ), and more precisely, on its section between the Hunstein Mountain range
and the Washkuk Hills. Avatip is the major village in terms of population, of physical size, of
ceremonial signiﬁcance, and of military exploits. We return to this in §1.2.2 and §1.4.
The Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma have been fortunate, in terms of attracting
high-quality anthropological research. Useful and highly informative accounts of the Manambu culture in Newton (1971), Bragge (1990), and especially Harrison (1983, 1985a–b, 1987,
1990a–b, 1993) contain anthropological analysis and innumerable insights into the cultural
and cognitive patterns of Manambu ritual and everyday life over the years. This is why this and
the following sections are limited to a very brief sketch of cultural background, with just the
information necessary for understanding the grammar which follows.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices
We now turn to further issues in Manambu syntax, starting with a discussion of the structure
of major constituents and order of words within them. We then summarize the properties of
clause types and criteria for determining core grammatical relations (§20.1). We then discuss the
pragmatic motivations behind the ordering of constituents within clauses (§20.2). Highlighting
focus constructions are discussed in §20.3. The devices used for linking sentences in discourse,
including turn taking, and marking of topicality, are addressed in §20.4. There we also deal
with the principles of ellipsis—a prominent feature of Manambu discourse.20.1 m a j o r c o n s t i t u e n t s, c laus e ty p e s, and
grammatical relat ions
20.1.1 The structure of noun phrases
A noun phrase in Manambu is composed of a head—usually, a noun—and one or more
modiﬁers. If the noun head is omitted, a modiﬁer can be used in headless noun phrases. Closed
classes diﬀer in terms of whether they can occur as NP heads—this is summarized in Table
10.11 in §10.7. If a noun phrase is headed by a pronoun, no further modiﬁers can be used.
Inﬂected verbs within relative clauses, nouns, adjectives, and a number of closed classes
(personal pronouns, indeﬁnite pronoun n@k@- ‘other, another’, quantiﬁers, and numbers) can
all be modiﬁers in a noun phrase. We recall (§4.1.1) that prehead modiﬁers take a linker which
is only partially predictable. The most frequent order of modiﬁers in a noun phrase is in
Scheme 20.1.
As shown in §10.2.1, a spatio-temporal demonstrative and a ‘current relevance’ demonstrative can occur together in one NP, as in 10.40–1. The current relevance demonstrative
with no gender or number speciﬁcation occurs ﬁrst and the spatio-temporal one follows,
providing further speciﬁcation. The two complement each other, since the ‘current relevance’
demonstrative does not convey information about the gender of the noun or its additional
distance from either the speaker or the addressee. And a spatio-temporal demonstrative can
provide supplementary directional speciﬁcation.
Consider 20.1. Combining two demonstratives in one noun phrase allows the speaker to be
speciﬁc about the location of the village which is both upstream and inland, that is, away from
the river from where he is. The location ‘away from the river’ is expressed with a demonstrative
which follows the one stating the location ‘upstream’:
20.1 k@-na-wur

t@p-ad
dem.prox-curr.rel-up dem.prox-masc.sg-inland village-3masc.sgnom
‘It is this-previously mentioned village upstream, this-away from the river big village’
That the village is big is clear from the masculine gender assignment (§5.2.1).","[533, 534]"
"20.1 Major constituents52720.52a ñ@n-a
kamna:gw k@ka

dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg
‘Here is your food’ (pointing) (I have just put it here; it is here right now)
An alternative would be a predicative form of a reactivated topic demonstrative, as in 20.52b.
The implication is that the food has been here for some time, and its place is here.
20.52b ñ@n-a
kamna:gw k@ka-n-aka
you.fem-lk+fem.sg food
dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg
‘Here is your food’ (pointing)
We have already seen (20.49b) that a verbless clause may have an overtone of spontaneity. It
appears to be also the case in instances like 20.52a.
iii. Summarizing a preceding stretch of discourse can be achieved through using an adverbial
demonstrative on its own, in a verbless clause (and without a predicative marker), as in 20.53a.
An alternative is to use the word ‘manner’ in a similar structure—another verbless clause:
20.53a akatawa
thus
‘This is how it is’
20.53b akatawa sa:d
thus
way
‘This way (it is)’
An alternative for each of these would be either a predicative form of adverbial demonstrative (akatawa-n-a for 20.53a), or a non-verbal clause (akatawa sa:d-a for 20.53b). The verbless
versions sound more spontaneous and informal.
iv. Verbless clauses are used in a presentational function, as in T1.2.
v. Verbless clauses are used in questions (see C below) which involve manner and are marked
with the question words ata ata ‘how how’, as in 10.100, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’,
as in 10.98. Verbless clauses are also employed in questions involving naming, as in 10.102 and
20.54:
20.54 ata maway s@?
how ﬂower name
‘What’s the name of the ﬂower?’
Verbless clauses are also used in short questions used to enquire after someone: 20.55 is the
way of asking a child about his or her mother and father—that is, where they are, are they OK,
and so on:
20.55 amæy? asa:y?
mother father
‘(What about) mother? Father?’
A similar example is at 20.58—this is a question addressed to unknown beings in order to
ﬁnd out what food they would be capable of eating.
The interrogative pronoun ak@- ‘where’ (as in Table 10.7, example 10.90) is used in nonverbal clauses, since it requires non-verbal cross-referencing.
If negated, verbless clauses are indistinguishable from non-verbal ones: 20.56 is a negative
version of both a non-verbal clause l@ T@k@ta:y-a (she Teketay-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is Teketay’
and a verbless clause l@ T@k@ta:y ‘she is Teketay’:52820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.56 l@ T@k@ta:y ma:
she Teketay neg
‘She is not Teketay’
Table 20.1 summarizes the properties which diﬀerentiate between copula clauses, verbless
clauses, and two types of clauses with non-verbal predicates—those involving demonstratives
with the predicative marker -n- and the rest.
The arguments in favour of considering non-verbal clauses as a separate type of clauses
headed by non-verbs are: (a) kind of cross-referencing markers used, or lack thereof; (b)
negation; (c) tense distinctions expressed with cross-referencing; (d) occurrence in subordinate
clauses and in non-indicative moods; (e) semantics; (f) use in highlighting focus constructions;
and (g) constituent order.
Unlike copula clauses—which are similar to normal verbal clauses in all but their (lack of)
capacity to form commands—they are negated in the same, non-verbal, way, and have a strictly
subject-predicate order (see §20.2). Clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives
in the predicate slot share more properties with verbless clauses than they do with non-verbal
clauses.
But how do we identify grammatical relations, especially in verbless clauses? This is to be
taken up in §20.1.4.
B. Imperative clauses are always independent, and contain partially inﬂected imperativepermissive forms discussed in §13.2. Copula clauses, clauses with non-verbal predicates, and
verbless clauses cannot occur in imperative clauses. Some verbs—such as perception verbs—
have a telic meaning when used in commands; that is, 20.57 can only mean ‘you listen’ rather
than ‘you hear’ or ‘you understand’. (A loan verb understand was used in a command urging a
child to understand what the mother was saying and to act accordingly, in 17.26b.) We return
to the ways in which ‘see’ and ‘hear’ are used in commands in §21.1.2.
The ways in which imperatives can be negated were addressed in §14.4. An imperative
strategy can be used in lieu of an imperative-permissive form—see Table 19.5, to express
additional overtones to do with strength of the command.
The constituent order in imperative clauses follows the same principles as that in declarative
clauses (see §20.2): it is predominantly verb ﬁnal, but a constituent can be postposed to the
verb for disambiguation or if the participant is unexpected (see T1.16).
Imperative clauses have a rising intonation on the verb, if they imply a command, and even
if used as a turn-taking device, as in 20.57.
20.57 b@r
awuk
you.du impv+listen
‘You (two) listen!’
Permissive forms (see §13.2.2), which are often used in turn taking, tend to be pronounced with
an interrogative rising intonation—see C below.
C. Interrogative clauses correspond to either polar or content questions. We mentioned in
§10.4 that content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation,
while polar questions are marked by intonation only. There is no structural diﬀerence between
a positive polar question and a corresponding statement. Only the intonation and the context
decides. Some examples are at 10.79 and further examples in §10.4, 20.14–15, the last clauses of
T1.4 and T1.18, and the ﬁrst clause of T1.14. The last clause of T2.26 contains an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ cast as a question.","[553, 554, 555]"

⎭steadfast rule: if another constituent is more topical than the O, then it will be cross-referenced.
We saw in 3.7 above that, with the verb ‘give’, either the gift or the recipient can be crossreferenced, depending on their topicality. Only the ‘gift’ can be marked with accusative/locative,
while the recipient is always marked with dative.
In 3.14, the place which is the topic of the stretch of discourse is cross-referenced on the verb
(with the feminine gender form). The indeﬁnite direct object, unmarked for case, is not.

Alternatively, a completely aﬀected O marked with the accusative/locative case may be less
topical than the subject, especially if the verb is marked with the action focus -na-. In 3.15,
the angry man is determined to exterminate the moon who, as he thinks, is responsible for his
wife’s menstruation. The moon is marked for case and is the topic of the story, but is not crossreferenced: the action focus -na- shows that the focus is on the action and it is more important
than the O.

3.15Table 3.6 lists the examples illustrating the correlations between case marking and crossreferencing of O.
We conclude that cross-referencing on verbs and case marking on nouns follow diﬀerent
principles. Verbs distinguish between subject and (topical) non-subject, while nouns operate on
a principle reminiscent of nominative-accusative. In addition, nouns distinguish a rather large
number of forms for non-core participants. We return to the discussion of cases in Chapter 7.3.3 ‘ r e ac t i vat e d t o pi c’ d e m o n s t rat i v e s
There are three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’—k@- series ‘proximal to
the speaker’, wa- series ‘proximal to the hearer’, and a- series ‘distant from both’ (discussed in
detail in §10.2.3). These always agree in gender and number with the S/O argument. They are
employed to bring an already established topic ‘back to action’, if it has not been mentioned
for some time. Consider 3.16, said to 5-year-old Kerryanne who was running around at a
local market, to remind her of the existence of her mother and myself (whom she ought to
be following):
yi-na-b@r
3.16 abra
dem.dist.react.top+dual go-act.foc-3dubas.vt
‘Those two are going!’ (I am reminding you of them; or else you will be left behind)
If an O constituent is a reactivated topic, it is obligatorily cross-referenced on the verb (using
the basic set in the second cross-referencing position). In 3.17, the bundle of sago established
as a topic in the previous stretch of discourse is mentioned again. Since it is topical, it is also
cross-referenced on the verb:
3.17 na:gw ada
ka-war-la-d
sago dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg carry-go.up-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘She has carried up that previously mentioned sago’
With the ditransitive verb ‘give’, a reactivated topic marker refers to the recipient rather
than the gift if it is more animate than the gift, unless the gift is more topical. Example 3.18
comes from a story about a man (the topic of the whole story) who was considered dead by
his relatives. In the previous stretch of text the ﬂying fox who had been looking after the man
tells him that his relatives were arranging a mortuary feast for him. The man has not been
mentioned for a paragraph or so. Then, it turns out that the preparations for the mortuary
feast for the man are under way at the man’s house. The man is thus ‘brought back’ into the
text as the reactivated topic. The mortuary feast, in the O function in 3.18, is the gift; the
‘reactivated topic demonstrative’, and the cross-referencing on the verb, refer to the man:703 Grammatical Relationskui-da-d

‘They were giving mortuary feast to him (the reactivated topic)’
We will see, in §10.2.3, that a reactivated topic demonstrative can refer to the S of an
ambitransitive verb used intransitively. It can also refer to a location, as in 10.68. The content
of a direct speech report is never referred to with such a demonstrative. The problem of whether
the reactivated topic demonstrative forms one NP with a noun it refers to or not is discussed
in §10.2.3.
The predominantly absolutive (S/O) basis for the reactivated topic markers agrees with a
cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the S/O function and topicality (Du Bois
1987). That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis is hardly surprising—in
Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal demonstrative may only occur
in S or O function (Dixon 2003: 83, 94–99; Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). Reactivated
topic demonstratives provide a strong criterion for S (see, for instance, the discussion of
polyfunctional verbs and their argument structure in §4.2.2). The subject of a verbless clause or
head of non-verbal predicate is hardly ever referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative
(the implication of this is that it is not treated on a par with S arguments).3.4 gra m m at i c a l r e lat i o n s i n m a na m bu: a s ummary
Cross-referencing on the verb and case marking on nouns in Manambu operate on diﬀerent
principles. The choice of cross-referencing depends on the tense-aspect-mood and polarity, and
on the presence of a participant more topical than the subject. Case marking is reminiscent
of a nominative-accusative system, with the occurrence of the object case depending on the
deﬁniteness and the degree of involvement of the O. Systems of this kind are cross-linguistically
attested (see Aikhenvald 1994 for a brief survey).
Cross-referencing on the verb is more unusual. It follows a subject-non-subject principle. The
subject of a verb, be it A or S, always has to be cross-referenced. Any non-subject constituent—
with the exception of copula complement, transportative, comitative, and substitutive constituents, and speech reports—can be cross-referenced. (This is reminiscent of Alamblak, from
the Sepik Hill family.) The same, ‘basic’, marking is used for cross-referencing the subject (A/S)
with no other topical constituent; and for cross-referencing a topical non-subject. In addition,
all of the A/S of all verbs are marked in the same way. The subject of a non-verbal predicate
head acquires a somewhat diﬀerent marking, and does not distinguish tense.
In addition, three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’ operate on an absolutive basis, marking gender and number agreement with the topical S/O argument which is then
highly likely to be cross-referenced on the verb.
The three ways of marking grammatical relations allow for a highly elaborate way of specifying the topicality of participants and the involvement and deﬁniteness of the object.
A historical note is in order. The dependent marking on nouns appears older than the
unusual system of verbal cross-referencing. Cases for core arguments are a shared feature
of Ndu languages, while the personal marking of two arguments on verbs appears to be a
Manambu innovation also shared with Gala. Iatmul has only subject cross-referencing which
appears to be a relatively recent innovation.","[94, 95, 96, 97]"

some questions52953020 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesThe only instances of positive clauses with exclusively interrogative reading are short onenoun-phrase-long questions cast as verbless clauses. These are used to enquire after someone,
as in 20.55 and 20.58 (which contains a relative clause).
20.58 [ [b@r n@b@ k@-k@-bra]
[k@k@pa:t] ]
you.du able eat-fut-2dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt food
‘(What about) food you two will be able to eat?’
These clauses would not make sense as declarative verbless clauses, since—as we saw in A
above—verbless declarative clauses contain at least two independent NPs.
Polar questions display the same patterns of constituent order as do declarative clauses: 13.56
is an example of an oblique, ‘with them’, placed after the verb (see §20.2). Content questions
also display the same patterns.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause. It tends to gravitate towards the
beginning of the clause or to appear immediately before the verb, as in 10.87–8, T1.5, T1.30,
and T3.8. The only exceptions are verbless clauses involving the question word ata ata ‘how
how’ as in 10.100–2, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ (10.98): here the constituent order is
ﬁxed.
The pronoun s@ ‘who?’ is unlike other interrogative words in that it takes the linker -k@- in
order to combine with case markers. It is obligatorily marked for highlighting focus if in the
subject position. And if it is used as predicate head, as in 10.82, or is marked for focus, as in
10.83, and 20.59, its form is reminiscent of a headless associative NP (as illustrated in 8.14):
it takes gender-number markers -l- ‘feminine’, -d- ‘masculine’, -bra- ‘dual’, and -di- ‘plural’,
followed by a nominal predicate cross-referencing enclitic.

m@n-a:k
kwatiya-l
who-obl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom you-lk+dat give.to.nonthird.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘Who gave it to you?’
Examples like 20.59–60 can be interpreted as instances of obligatory grammaticalized focus,
not infrequent in content interrogatives worldwide. We will see, at §20.3 below, that a focused
constituent can only rarely be in the A function.
The interrogative ‘who’ can be marked for double focus; then the nominal cross-referencing
is repeated. The meaning is highly contrastive: ‘who is it really?’ (see §20.3). In 20.60, the
speaker is wondering whether the mysterious person who had entered his house is a man or a
woman.

who are staying?’
A clause may consist just of a question word, as in the last clause of T1.23. And any verbal
form, including the permissive (13.10), can occur in a question.
When negated, both content and polar questions take the negative dependent clause marker
-ma:r- if they contain a verb—see 14.127–30. However, as we saw in §14.5.2, this is not the only
option. Many speakers (and especially young and innovative ones) use negative declarative
forms in negative questions, as in 14.131 and 14.151. If a negative question contains a nonverbal or a verbless clause, it has the same structure as its positive counterpart:20.1 Major constituents53120.61 k@
kamna:gw vyakat ma:
dem.prox.fem.sg food
good neg
‘Is this food not good?’
Further issues, including the patterns of response to negative questions, were discussed in
§14.5.2.","[555, 556, 557, 558]"
"20.1 Major constituents517Another type of complex predicate with temporal meaning is restricted to dependent clauses
only and consists of a verb marked with the sequential -n and the generic completive verb
napa- accompanied by the appropriate clause-chaining marker(s) (see §18.9). The order of
components is ﬁxed. Modal complex predicates consist of one of the two modal verbs (see
§4.5.1, and examples 4.64–6 and 15.53) both meaning ‘be able to, can’ followed by an inﬂected
verb. These complex predicates cannot be negated, questioned, or occur in a command. The
order of components is also ﬁxed.
All the complex predicates consist of two independent grammatical and phonological words.
The components of complex predicates containing polyfunctional verbs (§§17.1–4) tend to be
contiguous. Unlike noun phrases, however, they are not strictly contiguous. Constituents such
as ata ‘then’, reactivated topic demonstratives, and adverbs can intervene between them, as in
12.81, 17.44, and 20.23.
20.23 day vak@r-@k
ata kur-di
they fall-purp.ss then do/get-3plbas.vt/p
‘They then were about to fall down’
In contrast, in 17.23, ata precedes the whole complex predicate. The diﬀerence is in the degree
of its topicality: the closer the constituent is to the beginning of the clause the more likely it is
to be a newly introduced topic.
And we can recall, from §14.1.3, that aspectual and positional complex predicates allow the
negator to precede the whole predicate, as in 14.29 and 20.24a, as a means of focusing on the
lexical verb. We were talking about various places in Australia, and the speaker was telling us
that he had never seen Melbourne with his own eyes.
20.24a wun Melburnam
ma: væn
t@
I
Melbourne+lk+acc/loc neg see+seq ‘stand’+neg
‘I haven’t seen Melbourne’
Alternatively, the negator can precede the auxiliary, and there is no focusing eﬀect, as in
20.24b—an answer to a question as to whether anyone had seen the little boy.
20.24b wun d@-k@-m
væn
ma: t@
I
he-obl-acc/loc see+seq neg ‘stand’+neg
‘I haven’t seen him’
Aspectual complex predicates contain the sequencing verb form in -n (see §18.2) also used
to link clauses. However, the negator can have such an eﬀect only in complex predicates, and
never in linked clauses. This demonstrates the diﬀerences in the synchronic status of the -n
forms within monoclausal complex predicates and within multiclausal structures.
In contrast, complex predicates with napa- ‘generic completive verb’ and with the two modal
verbs are always contiguous. They are also restricted in their use: neither can be negated, or
appear in any other clause types.
We can recall that the lexical verb which appears with napa- is always marked with the
sequential -n (see §18.9), while modal verbs allow for two options. The inﬂected verb can take
third person feminine past tense cross-referencing (as in 4.64–6 and 20.25a), and the resulting
construction has impersonal overtones and never occurs with ﬁrst person subject.
20.25a m@n
[n@b@ wakw@-l]
ma:
you.masc able go.out-3fem.sgbas.p again
‘You can go out again’51820 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesOr the inﬂected verb can be marked for person, number, and gender of the subject (as in 4.64,
15.53, and 20.25b). Then, there are no restrictions as to the person of the subject. The inﬂected
verb itself can appear in the future form, as in 4.64, 15.53, 20.25b, and 20.58, in the versatile
tense form, as in 19.58b, or in the past tense form, as in 20.25a. The choice is determined by
the presence of a future projection: 15.53, 19.58b, and 20.25b contain a threat, while 20.58 is a
question.
20.25b n@b@ kiya-k-na-ñ@n-@k
ya
can die-fut-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf emph
‘You can die (if you come near the broken ladder)’
In contrast, 20.25c is a statement about what is to be done with the leftovers from that day’s
meal:
20.25c s@r
n@b@ k@-da-l
tomorrow can eat-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘They can eat (this food) tomorrow’
No other forms of inﬂected verbs have been attested in the corpus. This suggests that clauses
containing the two modal verbs have a realis–irrealis type distinction not attested anywhere
else in the language. That is, they constitute a special clause type, albeit rare and restricted.
This takes us to the next issue—the clause types and their properties.","[543, 544, 545]"
"20.1 Major constituents515Only two such foreign elements have been observed in the domain of complex predicates, or
clauses. One is a Tok Pisin modal mas ‘must’ which can occur with third person imperative in
the meaning of strong obligation (13.22). The other is Tok Pisin nogut which was once used
by a speaker as a nonce code-switch accompanied by a dependent negative clause (14.125),
mirroring a corresponding structure in Manambu.
E. The limits of a noun phrase. A few more questions remain. First, how do we determine
the boundaries of a noun phrase? The relevant criteria include having one case per noun
phrase (see §7.1). So, for instance, the allative case form of an appositional noun phrase
Mak@mawi n@b@k ‘Makemawi mountain’ is Mak@mawi n@b@k@r . This is in contrast to 16.55
where [adaki n@b@k@r] [pause] [Mak@mawir] (dem.dist.masc.sg.across.away hill+lk+dat,
Makemawi+dat) ‘to (that) hill across (away from us), to Makemawi’ corresponds to two noun
phrases. This brings us to the next criterion—that of prosodic cohesion. The insertion of a
pause between the two allative-marked constituents indicates that these are indeed two noun
phrases.
Also, if a noun phrase appears in a highlighting focus construction it is focused as a whole: a
part of an NP cannot be focused separately. This explains why no constituent can be focused in
relative clauses, as shown in Table 19.1. That is, focalization is another criterion which helps us
determine the boundaries of an NP. Non-word class-changing suﬃxes detailed in §9.2 appear
once per noun phrase. And the emphatic enclitic -ya always goes onto the last word in a noun
phrase.
And, in addition to all this, we saw that the word order in a noun phrase is mostly ﬁxed—
except for the two instances of variable order in D above. For instance, an adjective followed
by a demonstrative belong to diﬀerent noun phrases, even if pronounced without a pause. An
example is in 20.19:
20.19 [wun kwasa
t@-lwun-@k]
[kwasa]
I
small+fem.sg be/stand-1fem.sgbas.p-conf small+fem.sg
[ [k@laki
Kudaway] l@-k@
ñ@np@k]
dem.prox+fem.sg+across Kudaway she-obl+fem.sg child+like
‘I was little (when the war started), little, like the daughter (lit. feminine child) of this
Kudaway across away’
This example contains two noun phrases: one is an adjective ‘small’ (feminine singular) used
headlessly, and the other is a possessive construction accompanied with the suﬃx -p@k ‘like’
with the possessor modiﬁed by a demonstrative. The speaker, Kukelyabau, spoke very fast,
and there were no pauses between the two. The placement of the demonstrative is indicative of
an NP boundary.
But are noun phrases in Manambu always contiguous? They are not. However, instances
of split noun phrases are limited to noun phrases with numerals and quantiﬁers as modiﬁers.
The numeral or the quantiﬁer can be split from the rest of the NP and postposed to the verb,
as a clariﬁcation (see §20.2). An example is in 20.20: the two women were staying together;
this togetherness is emphasized by positioning the numeral modiﬁer after the verb. There is no
pause before ‘two’—as would have been expected, if this were an afterthought.
[viti]
20.20 [a-b@r
ta:kw] pause abra
kwa-b@r
dem.dist-du woman pause dem.dist.react.top+du stay-3dubas.p two
‘Those women stayed (topical) two (of them together)’
We return to the functions of this postposed numeral in §20.2.
If a relative clause contains an additional argument or oblique, it can be placed into a
sentence-initial position as a means of focalizing it. We can recall, from Table 19.1, that no51620 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesconstituent of a relative clause can be focused independently. That is, removing an argument
or an oblique from within the relative clause and preposing it is the only available means of
focusing on it. Note that in such cases a relative clause—but not the whole noun phrase—is
discontinuous:
20.21a [gwa:r
a-d@
yi-d-@
kwasa-d@
ñan]
water+all dem.dist-masc.sg go-3masc.sgbas.p-lk small-masc.sg child
tayib
waku-d
before+term go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
‘That little boy who drowned (lit. to water that one which went) left home before (his
mother)’
The order of words without such preposition would have been:
20.21b [a-d@
gwa:r
yi-d-@
kwasa-d@
ñan]
dem.dist-masc.sg water+all go-3masc.sgbas.p-lk small-masc.sg child
tayib
waku-d
before+term go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
‘That little boy who drowned (lit. went to water) left home before (his mother)’
We saw in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives do not form one NP with the noun
they refer to (typically an O, an S, or a location). They agree with this noun in gender and
number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes or be arguments of postpositions. There can be
an intonation break between a demonstrative and an NP it refers to (as in 10.66 and in 20.20)—
something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend to occur immediately preceding the
verb, as in 20.20 and 20.22.

‘I will tell those stories about the shrimp which that woman across there got wrong’ (lit.

That is, reactivated topic demonstratives are not modiﬁers to a noun within a noun phrase,
even though they get translated as such, for want of a better equivalent in English.","[541, 542, 543]"

This is a grammar of Manambu, a language of the Ndu family, which is, in terms of numbers of
speakers, the largest language family of the Sepik area of New Guinea. Manambu is spoken by
about 2,500 people in ﬁve villages—three of which, Avatip, Malu, and Yambon, are suﬃciently
big to appear on most maps of Papua New Guinea. I started studying the language in 1995,
as part of my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I was interested in learning a
language with shape-based genders. Alan Rumsey was teaching a ﬁeld methods course at
the ANU, with Pauline Agnes Luma Laki as a consultant. I came along to the course, and
then carried on working with Pauline for more than ten years afterwards—this is how my
voyage of discovery started. I have since worked with several dozen speakers of Manambu,
mostly in Avatip. Pauline Agnes Luma Laki and myself are currently engaged in preparing a
comprehensive dictionary of the language.
This grammar contains an analysis of the Manambu language, starting from a brief characterization of the language and its speakers, then going on to phonology, morphology, syntax,
discourse organization, and semantics. The analysis is cast in terms of a cumulative typological
framework of linguistic analysis—which employs ‘the fundamental theoretical concepts that
underlie all work in language description and change’ (Dixon 1997: 128) and in terms of which
signiﬁcant typological generalizations are postulated; this has come to be called ‘basic linguistic
theory’. I have avoided employing any transient formalisms. This grammar is part of genuine
documentation of the Manambu language in its varied facets.
Every chapter of the grammar includes a presentation of the facts of the language interwoven
with arguments for their analysis within a typological framework. No attempt has been made
to separate pure ‘description’ from theoretical interpretation—which would not be a productive
task. A typological perspective for each phenomenon is crucial for the analysis given here.
Detailed exempliﬁcation is provided for every grammatical point. Most examples come
from texts, and a few from spontaneous—or carefully directed—conversation. An additional
objective was to convey as much of the Manambu culture as possible through using naturally
occurring examples. I avoid using elicited sentences; elicitation was limited to lexicon and to
paradigms.
English glosses are kept as close as possible to the glosses and explanations oﬀered by
my consultants. Readers should be warned against trying to draw conclusions concerning
Manambu grammar and semantics from study of the translations.
Examples, tables, diagrams, ﬁgures, charts, and footnotes are numbered separately within
each chapter. Footnotes are also numbered separately for each chapter. The orthography used
in the examples from languages other than Manambu, and language names, follows that of the
sources (unless indicated otherwise).
This grammar can be used as a sourcebook for further typological studies, and as a model
for further grammars of languages of the Ndu and of other families of the New Guinea area.
It is far from being the last word on Manambu—the grammar is intended to provide a sound
systematic foundation for further studies, reanalyses, and reinterpretations.
It is my hope that this book will encourage linguists to go out into the ﬁeld and document
languages threatened by extinction (before it is too late to do so). Nothing can compare with
the intellectual excitement of working out the grammatical system of a previously undescribed
language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"60822 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.4.2 Morphological and syntactic integration of Tok Pisin and English
code-switches and calques
Foreign nouns and other non-verbs often occur in their root form. They can be fully inﬂected.
Nouns ending in a consonant can take the linker a, as does beg ‘bag’ in 22.32c, ailand in T1.10,
kar ‘car’; or @, as does ailan ‘island’ in T1.11; or i , as does bus ‘bush’ in T1.21.
The behaviour of verbs in code-switching deserves special mention. A code-switch consisting
of a verb plus its object cannot be inﬂected, and has to occur with a support verb, as in 21.22.
Loan verbs can be treated as parts of complex predicates with support verbs (see examples
in §17.2.2), e.g. stati t@ - ‘start’, pinisi t@ - ‘ﬁnish’, andestand t@ - ‘understand’. Or they can be
inﬂected, as in 22.3, from a speech by an orator at the name debate (8 October 2004). In the
examples, English forms are underlined and Tok Pisin forms are in italics.
streti-k@-bana
22.3 witness em nau kamapu-n
witness it now come.up-seq correct/settle-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘As the witness/evidence is appearing, we will correct (the information)’
Or this may be uninﬂected, as in 22.4:
22.4 wun askim aka
k@p olsem wun askim
I
ask
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg only just I
ask
‘I am asking, I am just asking’
The same ‘code-switched’ verb can occur without either inﬂection or support verb, and then
occur inﬂected, within one sentence. Example 22.5, also from the name debate, illustrates this:
22.5 wun aka
stretim streti-ku
ya:kya
I
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg correct correct-compl.ss OK
‘I am now correcting (the statements by previous orators), after I have corrected (this), it
will be OK’
This is not restricted to a spontaneous oral discourse. Kulanawi, Simon Harrison’s classiﬁcatory father, dictated me a letter which I was to send to Simon Harrison (whose Manambu
name is Yuas@s@g). Simon Harrison lives in Belfast, and Kulanawi was worried that he might
have been aﬀected by what Kulanawi saw as the ongoing warfare in Ireland:

‘Yuas@s@g, you did not reply to the letter I sent, this is why I am worried, as I did not
receive the letter, this war that is being fought ruined him, this is why it is that he has not
written me a letter, this is why father is worried’22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English609Verbs sali ‘send’ (tp salim), beki ‘answer’ (tp bekim), and bagarapi ‘ruin’ (tp bagarapim) are
inﬂected. Wori ‘be worried’ appears with a support verb.
This variability in the treatment of code-switches and borrowings is indicative of their uncertain status as marginal—albeit dangerously frequent—insertions into ‘proper’ Manambu.
We will now turn to the issue of the linear position of borrowings and code-switches
in Manambu, and to the question of morphological and syntactic calques from Tok
Pisin.
The position of borrowings and code-switches in a sentence, clause, and noun phrase in
Manambu presents a researcher with a number of puzzles. Moravcsik (1978) suggested that
a grammatical word can only be borrowed if the linear order with respect to its head is
also borrowed—that is, if a preposition is borrowed from language X into language Y, it
has to be borrowed as preposition, even if the language Y has nothing but postpositions.
(Also see Curnow 2001: 430–1 on a potential counterexample from Basque.) Manambu
partly follows Moravcsik’s prediction, and partly goes against it (also see Aikhenvald
forthcoming c).
In agreement with her prediction, borrowed or code-switched conjunctions keep the same
place in Manambu as they have in the source language—Tok Pisin. This is the case with o ‘or’
in T2.50, tasol ‘but’ in T2.3 and 22.7, and sapos ‘if’ in 22.8.

22.8 [sapos vitiyay-ad]
[ma:]

second-3masc.sgnom neg
‘If it is the second one (second child), this is no good (ﬁrst child is more important)’
The language-internal motivation behind this is that the few connectives Manambu has
occupy exactly the same position. The same applies to nau ‘then’ which occurs in the same
place in Manambu clauses as it does in the Tok Pisin spoken by the Manambu. This clausechaining insert accompanies the sequencing marker, and nau forms one phonological word
with the verb:
22.9 [Ya-tataka-nau]
ata wa-di
come-imm.seq-then then say-3plbas.p
‘On having come, they then said’
Within a noun phrase, non-agreeing adjectives of Tok Pisin extraction occupy the same place
as they would in Tok Pisin, and in Manambu, as shown in 22.17, and 22.10.
22.10 a
liklik ma:j wa-k@-tua
then little story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Then I will tell a little story’
A Tok Pisin indeﬁnite pronoun sampela ‘some’ or narapela ‘(an)other’ precedes a Tok
Pisin adjective, as would its Manambu equivalent n@k@- ‘(an)other, some’; it also precedes a
Manambu adjective, as in 22.11:61022 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.11 narapela ma:j wa-k@-tua
sampela kwasa
ma:j
(an)other story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt some
little+fem.sg story
‘I will tell another story, some little story (or other)’
A quantiﬁer planti ‘many’ precedes the noun, just like its Manambu equivalent samasa:m
(see 22.36); and a quantiﬁer olgeta ‘all’ follows the noun, just like Manambu aba:b ‘all’; 22.12b
was the speaker’s correction of his spontaneous code-switch in 22.12a.
22.12a ñan olgeta atawa kwa-na-dian
we all
thus stay-act.foc-1plbas.vt
‘We all stay like this’
22.12b ñan aba:b atawa kwa-na-dian
we all
thus stay-act.foc-1plbas.vt
‘We all stay like this’
In all the instances so far, the linear position of a Tok Pisin item was the same as that of its
Manambu counterpart. Not so for the numerals. We can recall, from §10.6.1, that numerals in
Manambu follow the head noun. In Tok Pisin, they precede it. When Tok Pisin wanpela ‘one, a’
appears in Manambu speech, it precedes the noun, following Moravcsik’s predictions that if a
term is borrowed, so is its linear order. Wanpela is quite frequent (and uniformly condemned as
‘bad language’). It appears with Tok Pisin nouns, as in 22.13–14, and with Manambu nouns, as
in 22.15–16 and 21.42 (where wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is repeated as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ).

The Tok Pisin form wanpela precedes any adjective in a noun phrase; it is more often found
with Tok Pisin adjectives than with those from Manambu:
22.17 wanpela liklik ma:j aka
wa-k@-tua
one/a
little story dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I will tell one little story’
Occasionally, wanpela and nak ‘one’ occur in one noun phrase, reinforcing each other (as
in 21.42). We return to this in § 22.5.4. In all these instances, wanpela has nothing to do with
counting; it is an indeﬁnite introducer for a new referent. A story in Tok Pisin would start with22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English611wanpela plus a participant—so this use of wanpela in Tok Pisin is an obvious consequence of a
tendency to ‘match genres’ in languages in contact (see Aikhenvald 2006b: 27), that is, sharing
pragmatic patterns and the ways of organizing discourse structures.
Other borrowed numerals do not behave this way. They always precede foreign nouns, as in
T2.21 and T2.40 tu wik ‘two weeks’ (from English). Code-switching in numbers is considered a
mistake—in T2.40 the speaker corrected himself by saying wik (tp, e) viti ‘two weeks’; in T2.41
he used sande viti ‘two weeks’, lit. ‘two Sundays’.
If used with a Manambu noun, Tok Pisin numerals typically follow them, just as a Manambu
numeral would, thus going against Moravcsik’s prediction. These numbers are used for counting, and often occur accompanied by Manambu terms, in ‘parallel’ structures:
22.18 n@k@-di t@n@b
foa faiv a:li taba:b kwa-na-di
other-PL household four ﬁve four ﬁve
stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Other (clan) households are four (or) ﬁve, four (or) ﬁve’
English and Tok Pisin terms are often used for numbers bigger than ten (as in T2.65)—see
§22.4.3 below, on the motivation for this.
The Tok Pisin preposition and adverb wantaim occurs in Manambu as a postposition, replacing the postposition wuk@n ‘together, with’ (see §4.5, and 4.68–9). The postposition wantaim is
used by younger speakers, and is considered highly substandard. An example spontaneously
produced is in 22.19:
22.19 m@n-a
wantaim yi-k-na-bran
you.masc-lk with
go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
‘We will go together with you; you and I will go together’
Other numerous code-switches involve pro-clauses, e.g. orait ‘OK’ often used similarly to
Manambu ya:kya ‘OK’ (see §20.4.2) (also see T2.50, T2.60, T2.65), em nau ‘this is it’, and em
tasol ‘this is it, just this’. They are not morphologically or syntactically integrated. The question
about whether they can be assigned to a Manambu word class remains open.
As we saw at the end of §4.5, the word class assignment for a number of Tok Pisin inserts is
problematic (this may justify considering them as code-switches rather than borrowings). One
such problematic word is the modal mas ‘must’ (from Tok Pisin mas) which—unlike any other
modal—can occur with an imperative-marked verb as in 13.22. Another one is tabu, from Tok
Pisin tambu, ‘be prohibited’. This form never occurs inﬂected. It can head a predicate, as in
22.20:
g@ñ@r warya-wari tabu
22.20 Apat@pa-wa
Avatip+lk-com later ﬁght-red forbidden
‘Later on it was forbidden to ﬁght with Avatip’
Or it may form one constituent with an inﬂected verb in non-future or in future, in what
superﬁcially looks like a complement clause construction, as in 22.21–2:
22.21 abra-wur
b@yib ñan tabu
r@-bana

‘There is no hitting them, it is forbidden for me to hit (them)’ (lit. I am forbidden I will
hit)
In terms of its synchronic status, tabu forms a subclass of its own.
The Tok Pisin completive marker pinis also behaves in an unusual way when it occurs in
Manambu speech. It can head a predicate (and be modiﬁed by olgeta ‘altogether’, also from
Tok Pisin), as in 22.23, or form a whole clause, as in 22.24 (where it is preceded by a pause):

‘Having completely killed all . . . ’
Mas, tabu, and pinis may be interpreted as tokens of incipient ‘loan’ morphology in Manambu
(see §4.5.6).
Syntactic and morphological calques from Tok Pisin are diﬃcult to identify because of the
nature of Tok Pisin as a Creole language. Any structural similarity between Tok Pisin and
Manambu may well be due to the indigenous substratum in Tok Pisin itself rather than its
inﬂuence on Manambu. Such similarities include some compounds, e.g. Manambu mæn-ta:b
(leg-hand), Tok Pisin lekhan ‘hands and feet’, the polysemy of Manambu vya- ‘hit, kill’ and
Tok Pisin kilim, and numerous others.
If the Manambu patterns used by frequent code-switchers into Tok Pisin (most, but not
all, of whom are younger than 40–50) diﬀer from those employed by traditional speakers and
display striking structural similarity to Tok Pisin, we can suspect that calquing is at work. For
instance, code-switchers tend to use the postposition wuk@n in many contexts where a comitative would be expected (see §7.9), and even replace it with wantaim (see above). This reﬂects a
tendency towards analytic constructions possibly developed under Tok Pisin inﬂuence. Codeswitchers display more frequent verb-medial order than traditional speakers, which may again
be due to the Tok Pisin inﬂuence (traditional speakers have a pronounced verb-ﬁnal tendency
in their constituent order).
The more Tok Pisin the person uses, the more impoverished their Manambu sounds—such
speakers would prefer series of juxtaposed clauses to clause chains (see Chapters 18–19), and
would rarely use certain clause-chaining markers, such as -taka ‘immediate sequence’. This
takes us to the issue of incipient language obsolescence—taken up in §22.6.1.","[634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639]"

Grammatical Relations
Understanding grammatical relations in Manambu is pivotal for understanding its grammar.
A member of any major word class can head an intransitive predicate, or be a modiﬁer in an
NP. A verb as head of either transitive or intransitive predicate takes tense- and topicalitysensitive verbal cross-referencing suﬃxes, to mark subject (A/S) and non-subject. In contrast,
if a member of most other classes is head in an intransitive predicate, it takes person-marking
enclitics (§3.1). Grammatical relations are also marked by cases on nouns, on subject-nonsubject basis (§3.2), and through a set of demonstratives, on an absolutive basis (§3.3).3.1 c ro s s -referencing
Nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and most closed subclasses (see Chapter 10) can head an
intransitive predicate. Only a verb can be head of a transitive predicate. In the indicative mood,
all Manambu verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments. One of these has to be the
subject—A or S. A non-subject argument can also be cross-referenced if it is more topical than
the subject, independently of the verb’s transitivity.
This is how it works. In 3.1, the S=A ambitransitive verb ‘know’ is used intransitively. The
suﬃx -na- ‘action focus’ indicates that the focus is on the fact of knowing, and not on what
is known. The subject (S), ‘I’, is cross-referenced on the verb. The cross-referencing suﬃxes
employed are in Table 3.1.
3.1 b@
laku-na-wun
already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I know (already), I am knowledgeable’
This same verb can be used transitively, with an object. The object in 3.2 is not topical—
that is, it is not something to be further deployed in the discourse. The subject (A) is the only
participant cross-referenced on the verb:
3.2 (wun) a
yar@k b@
laku-na-wun
I
dem.dist+fem.sg news already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I already know that news’
If a constituent other than the subject is more topical than the subject, both are crossreferenced on the verb. In 3.3–4 the object is topical, and it is cross-referenced in the second
position on the verb, with the same markers as the ones used for the S/A in 3.1–2 (Table 3.1).
The subject is also cross-referenced, but with a diﬀerent set of markers (Table 3.2). Person
marking on the verb can occur together with a full NP. Since the NP is optional, it is in
parentheses.

know-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘I have understood it (e.g. a long story)’
An oblique can be cross-referenced on the verb, if topical. The destination, ‘road’, is the
topic of 3.5, and is cross-referenced in the second position on the intransitive verb ‘go’. The
road is in the allative case (§7.5).

The choice of an argument or an oblique to be cross-referenced on a verb depends on the
topicality of this argument (or oblique), and also on the verb’s semantics. Out of context,
3.6 could be understood as ‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’ (then, the object
‘work’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’ (then,
‘time’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’ (then
‘way, manner’, of feminine gender (§5.2.1), would be cross-referenced). The cross-referenced
constituent can be overtly expressed, but does not have to, inasmuch as it is retrievable from the
context:
3.6 a
yawi kus@-tu@-l
dem.dist+fem.sg work ﬁnish-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’
‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’
‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’
Example 3.7 also has two meanings—diﬀerentiated only by the context.
3.7 ñap-a-ta:kw
Dora kui-la-b@r
mother’s.sister-lk-woman Dora give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
‘Aunt Dora gave (us) these two (Malay apples)’
‘Aunt Dora gave (Malay apples) to the two (girls)’
Topical constituents which can be cross-referenced in the second position include time,
location, destination, and manner. The following can never be cross-referenced:
(a) A copula complement—see 3.8 and 3.9. The copula subject is always cross-referenced;
the second position can be occupied by location, manner or time.

bathe’; m@l ‘eye’ in m@l v@- (eye see) ‘see with eyes’; or wapruku- ‘be overfull’, as 3.11.
Here, ‘house’ (of masculine gender) is the subject:

‘Their whole house was overﬂowing with money’
(d) A constituent marked with a transportative, substitutive, or comitative case—see
§§7.7–9.
(e) A speech report—see §19.5.
Ellipsis of noun phrases, frequent in speech, makes the exact reference of cross-referenced
participants highly context dependent. Statistically, some participants tend to be crossreferenced more often than others. For instance, the addressee of the verb wa- ‘say’ is more
often cross-referenced than the message. This has to do with the fact that wa- is frequently
used to frame direct speech reports which can never be cross-referenced. A form wa-k@-tua-di
(say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) can mean ‘I will tell (something) to them’, or ‘I will tell them,
e.g. stories’, depending on the context.
A form kur-m@na-d@wun (do/make-2sgsubj.vt-1masc.sgbas.vt) is more likely to mean ‘you
did (something) to me’, than ‘you created or made me’, if the story from which this example
comes is not a creation myth. With the verb ‘give’, the overall frequency of cross-referencing
either the ‘recipient’ or the ‘gift’ is the same (this goes against the frequently discussed preference, among the languages of the world, to mark the recipient rather than the ‘gift’ of
‘give’).
In contrast to verbs, non-verbal predicates cross-reference just the subject, with crossreferencing enclitics listed in Table 3.4.
Table 3.1 features the ‘basic’ set of cross-referencing markers used for
(i) the subject, if no other, more topical, constituent is to be cross-referenced—as in 3.1–2;
(ii) the more topical constituent other than the subject—as in 3.3–5.
In situation (ii), the subject is cross-referenced with a special set of cross-referencing suﬃxes
as listed in Table 3.2. A marker from this set is always followed by a marker from the ‘basic’ set.
The relevant verbal cross-referencing sets distinguish what we call ‘versatile tense’ (employed
for present, recent past, and in future contexts—see §12.2). The tense distinction is neutralized
in dual and plural of the basic set. The non-tense-sensitive suﬃxes in the subject set are the
ones used in partially inﬂected verbal forms (where only the subject is expressed: see §11.1.1).
The two sets of personal markers are similar, but not identical. The versatile tense basic set
diﬀers from its past counterpart only in the feminine singular forms. The versatile tense subject
markers diﬀer from their past tense counterpart in the quality of the ﬁnal vowel in all the forms
except for ﬁrst and third person plural where the present–recent past set has an extra syllable
-na.
The basic sets diﬀer from the subject sets in ﬁrst person (all numbers). The subject set has no
gender distinctions in ﬁrst person. The basic sets are easily segmentable: they contain gendernumber markers -d- ‘masculine’, -l/ø- ‘feminine’ in the singular, and number markers -b@r ‘dual’ and -di- ‘plural’, in dual and plural forms respectively.
All other forms are similar to personal pronouns featured in Table 3.3. The basic set shows
more similarities with the personal pronouns than the subject set. The ﬁrst person markers in
the subject sets are not related to the personal pronouns at all.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"51220 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesThe suﬃx -a:b, -aba:b ‘too’ is also used as a way of coordinating noun phrases—see 20.13
below, and the discussion in §9.2.
Juxtaposition of noun phrases is used for two additional purposes. First, a juxtaposed
noun can provide additional information to the preceding noun phrase, as in T2.63, k@-di
Sabrayi-b@r Vali:k (dem.prox-pl Sabray-ass.pl Vali:k) ‘these relatives of Sabrayi, the Vali:k
clan’. We can recall, from §19.7, that juxtaposed clauses can be employed in a similar function
(see 19.81).
Secondly, two noun phrases or two modiﬁers within a noun phrase can be juxtaposed as a
means of expressing disjunction, e.g. 20.12–13. Lengthy noun phrases like the one in 20.13 are
not very frequent in discourse.

dem.prox-pl-too
‘Our villages (are) three or four, Malu, Avatip, Yuanab, and Yawabak, these too’
The ﬁrst noun phrase in 20.13 illustrates an additional strategy used for disjunction—the
Tok Pisin loan conjunction o. This is now used by speakers of all generations, to conjoin noun
phrases, as in 20.13, or modiﬁers, as in 20.14, or even clauses, as in 10.82. The speaker who
asked 20.14 was among the few old ladies whose Tok Pisin was rather fractured; this did not
stop her from using the Tok Pisin import o.

little.fem.sg or big.fem.sg water wash-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
‘Have you washed a little bit or all over?’ (lit. have you water-washed a little or a lot?)
This conjunction can link sentences, as in 20.15 (continuation of 10.82). There is a pause
between the two sentences, the second of which is introduced with o. The character was trying
to ﬁnd out whether the owner of the house was a man or a woman:

wi-ad]
stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
‘Is it a house where a man stays (lives)? Or is it a house where a woman stays (lives)?’
If there are more than two alternatives, the loan disjunction o occurs between the last two,
e.g. Telefom@n Oksapm@n o Vanimo-a:m (Telefomin Oksapmin or Vanimo-lk+loc) ‘in Telefomin, Oksapmin, or Vanimo’. Once again, this is a Tok Pisin pattern replicated in Manambu.
Another option is to use the repeated conjunction aw ‘then’ (see §19.6) which then refers to
alternating actions or marks alternatives, as in aw kami: aw lau-lap (then ﬁsh then ripe-banana)
‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana (or both)’.
D. The order, and types, of modifiers in noun phrases. No noun phrases have all the
positions ﬁlled, for semantic and phonological reasons. The longest noun phrase in the corpus20.1 Major constituents513contains six modiﬁers: a-d-@ n@k@-d-@ [wiy-a-m s@ kwa-na-d-@] n@ma-d-@ gla-ka-g@l du-a
ñan (dem.dist-masc.sg-lk other-masc.sg-lk house-lk-loc sleep lie-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vtlk big-masc.sg-lk black-int-black man-lk child) ‘that other very black boy (male child) lying
asleep in the house’. An average noun phrase is likely to contain two to three modiﬁers, e.g.
br@-br@-k@ n@k@ kapab-a wi (3du-3du-poss+fem.sg other+fem.sg separate-lk house) ‘another
separate house of well and truly their own’.
A modiﬁer can itself be a noun phrase, as in [[Yuajan kuk@b]-a du] (Yuajan behind+term-lk
man) ‘son who followed Yuajan’ (lit. man after Yuajan).
The article-like third person pronouns do not combine with the inherently indeﬁnite noun
m@wi ‘things like this’. There can be just one quantiﬁer or a numeral in a noun phrase, and
not more than two adjectives. Typically, in a complex noun phrase only one of the coordinands
is a long possessive NP—as in 20.10. In everyday conversations, speakers avoid long noun
phrases—this is in contrast to long clause chains which nobody (except for children under 10)
seems to mind using under any circumstances. In T1.23 a demonstrative precedes a possessive modiﬁer (a-d@ l@-k@-d@ ñamus (dem.dist-masc.sg she-obl-masc.sg younger.sibling) ‘that
younger brother of hers’). In T1.14, a demonstrative precedes a relative clause (k@ s@ kwa-na
bap (dem.prox.fem.sg sleep stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt moon) ‘this sleeping moon’). A noun
phrase with three modiﬁers (‘he this son of ours’, that is, ‘this previously mentioned child of
ours’) is at 20.70.
Alternatively, an NP containing modiﬁers can occupy the possessor slot, or both as in
T3.34 [[a:bab-a du ta:kw] d@y-a-k@ya:m] (all-lk man woman they-lk-poss+fem.sg smell)
‘the smell of all the people’, and in [[amæy karaki] l@-k@-d@ [a-d@ numa-d@ wiya:m]]
(mother death.adder she-obl-masc.sg dem.dist-masc.sg big-masc.sg house+lk+loc) ‘in that
big house of mother death adder’. A relative clause can contain a noun with a modiﬁer, as in
T3.40 ([[a-l-ay ñan] s@ki-la-d@ s@] (dem.dist-fem.sg-dist youngster call.name-3fem.sgsubj.vt3masc.sgbas.vt name) ‘the name that young lady there called’). An example of a complex noun
phrase with a relative clause in both possessor and possessee is in 20.22.
A noun phrase of any length can occur with a postposition: see §4.5.2. A possessee—the
head of the noun phrase—can be modiﬁed by a demonstrative, as in T3.5 ([a-di [karaki l@-k@di ñan-ugw]] (dem.dist-pl death.adder she-obl-pl child-pl) ‘those children of a death adder’).
An NP with modiﬁers can be in apposition to, say, a pronoun, as in T1.32 (ñan [k@-di k@pak@-di ta:kw] (we dem.prox-pl earth+lk-poss-pl woman) ‘we these women of this earth’).
The order of modiﬁers in an NP tends to be ﬁxed. Agreeing modiﬁers (third person pronoun
in article-like function and demonstratives) precede the non-agreeing ones, and the third person
pronoun in an article-like function always precedes all other agreeing modiﬁers, e.g. [d@ a-d@
n@k@-d@ du] (he dist.dem-masc.sg other-masc.sg man) ‘that very one (previously mentioned
important participant) other man’ (also see 10.3).
A noun phrase cannot contain a sequence of two agreeing adjectives (see §4.3.1). If two
agreeing adjectives occur together one of them has an adverbial meaning, e.g. kwasa n@map@k-a ñan (small+fem.sg big+fem.sg-compar-lk child) ‘a child that is a little bigger (than
another child)’.
A noun phrase usually contains no more than two adjectives. An agreeing adjective precedes
the non-agreeing one (as shown in §4.3.1). In a sequence of non-agreeing adjectives, a dimension term precedes a colour term, as in g@rg@r ñikiñiki ñan (tiny red:red child) ‘tiny pink baby’
(said ironically to a 3-year-old crying as if she were a baby). This is similar to many languages,
including English. A non-agreeing value adjective precedes another non-agreeing adjective, as
in vyakata-yak@ kula p@taka:u (good-very new ladder) ‘a good new ladder’. Only once did
I register a noun phrase with three adjectives: the agreeing adjective preceded the sequence51420 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesof non-agreeing ones: kwasa-kwasa g@rg@r ñikiñiki ñan (small-red+fem.sg tiny red:red child)
‘little tiny pink baby’.
There are just two instances of variable word order within a noun phrase, which is determined by pragmatic parameters. First, a demonstrative and a pronominal possessive marker
may occur in either order. In 20.16, the demonstrative precedes the possessive marker and in
20.2 it follows.
20.16 [l@ kamnagw-a:b ma: kray]
[gu-a:b

ñ@n@k-a:b] ]
she-obl-masc.sg child+lk+dat-too
‘She did not bring the food either, did not bring the water either for that (previously
mentioned) child of hers either’
The reason for the diﬀerent positions of demonstratives lies in the status of the head noun. In
20.2, the new participant, Kainu, has just been introduced, while Lumawandem, the possessor,
is an established referent. In 20.16, the child has been introduced some time ago (also see
§20.2, for an explanation of a non-verb-ﬁnal constituent order here); the demonstrative here
has a distinctly anaphoric function.
Numerals (other than ‘one’) and quantiﬁers can either precede or follow the head noun. We
saw in §§10.5–6 that a newly introduced or a non-topical referent is followed by a quantiﬁer,
and once the referent is established it is preceded by a quantiﬁer. In 20.17, the characters ate
any old three bananas, and so the numeral follows the noun.
20.17 [ [laulap mugul] kan
napa-da-k]
[ada
banana three eat+seq compl.vb-3pl-compl.ds dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
wa:d]
say+3masc.sgbas.p
‘After they’d eaten three bananas, he then said’
In contrast, in 20.18 the children are deﬁnite, and so the numeral precedes the head noun. A
preposed quantiﬁer or a numeral takes a linker.
20.18 [ [k@-di
mugul-a ñan-ugw] kur-ku]
[ata ya:l]
dem.prox-pl three-lk child-pl get-compl.ss then go+3fem.sgbas.p
‘Having taken these three children she then went’
Similar examples are at 10.116–17. This goes hand in hand with the general principle of
ordering words and constituents in Manambu: a new and less established participant comes
ﬁrst. We return to this in §20.2.
We will see, in the next chapter, that many speakers code-switch with Tok Pisin. The codeswitches behave in somewhat peculiar ways—which justify their treatment as ‘foreign morphology’. The complex issue of how such code-switches are assigned to word classes in Manambu
was mentioned in §4.5.6. Code-switches are equally foreign with respect to their syntactic
position: as predicted by Moravcsik (1978), they occupy the same position in a Manambu
constituent as they would in Tok Pisin, despite the fact that such a position would have been
unthinkable in ‘proper’ Manambu (see §22.4).
So, wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is a spontaneously produced variant of ta:kw nak
‘one woman’, and wanpela liklik ma:j (one:tp small:tp story) or wanpela kwasa ma:j (one:tp
small+fem.sg story) both correspond to kwasa ma:j nak (small+fem.sg story one) ‘one little
story’. Such noun phrases with foreign forms in a foreign order are marginal in that they are
rare, and speakers have a pejorative attitude towards them.","[538, 539, 540, 541]"
"14.1.3 Contiguity in non-future negative constructions, and the scope of negation
In future negative constructions, the verb and the negator are always contiguous, and form one
phonological word. In non-future negative constructions, contiguity is not required. Then the
order of the negator and the verb cannot be reversed: the negator has to precede the negative
verb.
The only form which obligatorily intervenes between the negator and the negated verb is the
adverb n@bay ‘yet, already’, as in 14.20. Any other order is ungrammatical (see 14.20a).
14.20 d@ ma: n@bay yæy
come.neg
he neg yet
‘He has not come yet’
14.20a?? ∗ d@ n@bay ma: yæy
he yet
neg come.neg
‘He has not come yet’—???
The following types of constituents may intervene between the negator and the negative verb
form. The eﬀect is focusing on the intervening constituent. As mentioned in §20.3, individual
constituents hardly ever occur in highlighting focus in negative constructions. Changing their
position in a clause is one way of focusing them.
1. The adjective yara ‘well, ﬁne’ used adverbially can intervene between the negator and the
negated verb, as in 14.21a where ‘well’ is in focus.
14.21a wun ma: yara la:kw
I
neg well know.neg
‘I do not know (this) well (contrary to what you may expect)’30414 NegationIn 14.21b, ‘well’ is not in focus:
14.21b wun yara ma: la:kw
I
well neg know.neg
‘I do not know (this) well’
2. The object can intervene between the negator and the negated verb, as in 14.22–3, with the
object in highlighting focus:
14.22 man-ta:b ma: ap
t@
foot-hand neg bone/force have.neg
‘(His) hands and feet had no strength’
14.23 k@ta wun ma: br@-k@-m
wuk@mar
now I
neg 3du-obl-acc forget.neg
‘Now I haven’t forgotten these two (white people) (despite the fact that we lost touch)’
3. The copula complement can intervene between the negator and the negated verb. In 14.24,
the narrator stresses that people and apawul spirits are not friendly because of a number of
misunderstandings—in contrast, they fear each other:
ma: kapawi t@
14.24 al@k
ñan-awa
this.is.why we-lk+com neg friend be.neg
‘This is why (they) are not friends with us (they are scared of us)
4. The subject can intervene between the negator and the verb. An example of the A of t@‘have’ is at 14.25—this is what a speaker said about her siblings:
ma: ñan t@
14.25 takwa-d@ka
du-a-ma:gw
woman+lk-only man-lk-’thing’ neg we have.neg
‘(We are) just women, we (in contrast to others) do not have brothers’
In 14.26, gu ‘water’, in the S function, intervenes between the negator and the verb:
r@
14.26 ma: gu
neg water sit.neg
‘There was no water (in contrast to what was expected)’
5. An oblique in a locative, or an allative case, can intervene between the negator and the verb,
as in 14.27–8, and T3.14:
14.27 [yæj
k@-na-wur

‘(The two brothers) did not take (their new sister) out into the sun’ (contrary to what
would be expected)
6. A part of complex predicate marked with the sequential -n (see §17.1.1 and §16.2.3) can
intervene between the negator and a posture verb, as a means of focusing on the lexical verb:14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses30514.29 ñan [Malu kwa-na

Examples like 14.21–9 are common to all generations of speakers of all levels of proﬁciency.
In most such cases, the intervening word does not exceed two syllables. An exception is at
14.24—but note that it comes from a story by an elderly man who was trying his best to be as
elaborate as possible.
Only highly elaborate speakers allow a whole clause to intervene between the negator and
the verb. Examples are at 14.30 and 14.31.

14.30 a-d@
a:s ma: [ya:n
dem.dist-masc.sg dog neg come+seq 3du-obl-dat face put.neg
‘That dog did not show his face by coming to them two’ (contrary to what they expected)
In 14.31, two constituents intervene between the negator and the negated verb—the adverb
n@bay (for which this is the only possible position) is placed close to the negator, and followed
by a dependent clause ‘like I stay’. The spirit of a dead woman refuses to give her living husband
the food she eats in the world of the dead:
ma:,
14.31 m@n-a:k

you.masc neg yet
‘I won’t give you these ﬁsh, those shrimp, you are not yet in the same state as I am
(contrary to what you may think)’
There is an intonation break between ma: n@bay ‘not yet’ and the rest. This is not surprising:
ma: n@bay behaves like a ﬁxed expression.
If a multiword complex predicate consists of an inﬂected auxiliary and an uninﬂected part
(see Chapter 17), the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate intervenes between the negator
and the inﬂected part. This is shown in 14.32.
t@
14.32 d@ væy ma: warya-n
he spear neg quarrel/ﬁght-seq have+neg
‘He hadn’t fought with spear’
To focus the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate, this has to be preposed to the negator.
Note that the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate cannot follow the negative form of the
auxiliary—this is in contrast to uninﬂected verbs which are not part of complex predicates
(§17.1–2). In 14.33, the speaker focuses on the fact that she had never ever seen European-type
long hair (she had heard of this, but this was her ﬁrst-time visual experience):

t@-na-p@k]

‘I have never before seen hair like you have’
Complex predicates consisting of a nominal and a verb are negated just like other complex
predicates in 14.32: the whole complex predicate follows the negator, as in 14.34–5:30614 Negation14.34 wun ma: s@kul@k y@

The position of negator and the eﬀect of reversing the order of the nominal, or the
dependent-marked verb, and the negated verb help diﬀerentiate superﬁcially similar complex
verbs containing auxiliaries (as in 14.33–5) and sequencing structures (as in 14.29).
In none of the examples discussed above does the change in the position of the negator
aﬀect the scope: the negator consistently has the whole clause within its scope. There is just
one exception. The adverb m@yir appears to be unique in that the scope of negation diﬀers
depending on its position in a clause. In 14.36, m@yir ‘really’ precedes the negator, and the verb
is within the scope of negation.
14.36 a-di
ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw
m@yir ma: la:kw
dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman really neg know.neg
‘Other people really do not know those stories’
In 14.37, this same adverb intervenes between the negator and the verb. Either the verb or
the adverb can be understood as being within the negator’s scope. The ambiguity is resolved
by context.

14.37 a-di

‘Other people do not really know those stories’ or ‘Other people really do not know

Manambu has no negative pronouns. The numeral ‘one’ in its indeﬁnite meaning is used in
negative clauses, meaning ‘not one’, as in 12.7 (nak-a:b@ ma: y@ (one-too neg go) ‘not one
escapes’), and T3.14 where the form nakam@y ‘single one (feminine)’ is used.
If a constituent other than the predicate is to be negated, it has to form an independent nonverbal clause negated by ma:. To say ‘not only in Avatip’ one literally says ‘only in Avatip—no’,
as in 14.38. The non-verbal negative clause is in square brackets.

A negative non-verbal clause can occupy the same position as a noun phrase. For instance,
the word for ‘bald’ is nab ma: t@- (hair neg have). How this term was used is shown in 14.39
(an example of the argument elaboration construction: §6.2.3). That ma: ‘negator’ forms one
constituent with nab ‘hair’ and not with the verb t@- ‘have’ is evident from the form of the14.2 Negation of habitual clauses307verb: it is inﬂected as a positive, and not as a negative verb. A negative form of t@- is shown
in 14.40—this sentence was used to describe a girl who is not bald, but whose hair had been
shaved because of lice. (Constituency is indicated with square brackets.)
14.39 [an
Bob wuk@n] [nab ma:] t@-na-bran

‘We two, Bob and I, are bald’ (lit. we have there-is-no hair)
14.40 nab [ma: t@]
hair neg have.neg
‘She has no hair’
Negating one constituent as a separate non-verbal clause produces the eﬀect of strong
contrast. One sister is saying to the other: ‘We two will eat that sago with coconut’, and the
younger sister replies 14.41:
ma:, bal-awa
14.41 ka!
t@p-a:wa
dem.prox+3fem.sgnom coconut-lk+com neg pig-lk+com
k@-k@-ta
eat-fut-1dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘ “That? (meaning: no way!), not with coconut, we will eat (sago) with pork!” ’
A similar example is at 10.145 (‘few, not many, few people went down (river)’).
As we will see in §14.6, the negator ma:—unlike any other negator—can be used as a
complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ with the meaning of ‘forbid, negate, refuse’. This is illustrated
in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42. In such constructions the verb wa- remains inﬂected as required. The
second occurrence of ‘say no’ is negated in the last line of 14.42.

‘ “Across there they will refuse (say no) to me getting ﬁre.” “No, go out, they won’t

This example also illustrates another usage of ma:—that of a general negative pro-clause.
We return to this in §14.6. Inherently negative lexemes (see §14.6) co-occur with clausal negator
ma:. They do not have the same scope eﬀects as does ma:. Neither do other negators.14.2 ne gat i o n o f h a b i t ua l c lau s e s
Habitual clauses (which require the verb in habitual aspect marked with the suﬃx -kwa‘present’, -yikwa- ‘past’: see §12.3) are negated with the negator ak@s which occurs with the
verb in habitual aspect (marked with the suﬃx -kwa-). Unlike the general negator, ak@s cooccurs with fully inﬂected verbs, as in 14.43–4, 10.5, and 10.60. The negative habitual refers to
what is typically not done.

predicate head:
14.44 yabi:b ak@s
kuprap t@-kwa-na-di

stay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘They do not become bad quickly’
We can recall, from §4.2.2, that the verb kui- ‘give to third person’ is quite unusual in that it
has two alternative forms of the negative habitual. Unlike other verbs in the language, it does
not have to take the suﬃx -yikwa- ‘past habitual’ in the past negative form. Two options are
thus available for ‘give’ in past habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The
regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not) give habitually’, is shown in 4.37 and 14.45:
14.45 ak@s
kui-yikwa-l
d@-k@
ta:kw
neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab.past-3fem.sgbas.p he-obl+fem.sg wife
‘She never used to give (them food), his wife’
The alternative non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s, is shown
in 4.38 and 14.46. Within the same story, 14.45 and 14.46 follow each other.
ak@s
kui-d
14.46 ñaj

paternal.uncle wife bad-3fem.sgnom neg.hab give.to.third.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘Paternal uncle’s wife was bad, she never gave (children food)’
A negative construction containing the negator ak@s and an inﬂected verb forms two grammatical and two phonological words. A habitual negative construction with ak@s does not have
to be contiguous. In 9.21 the copula complement precedes the construction of ak@s followed
by an inﬂected verb, and in 14.44 the copula complement is positioned between the negator
and the inﬂected verb. The eﬀect of inserting a constituent between ak@s and the inﬂected
verb is essentially the same as that in constructions with the non-future negative structures
involving the declarative non-habitual negator ma: (see §14.1.3 above): the inserted constituent
is in highlighting focus.
In fact, any constituent, except for subject or object, can intervene between ak@s and the
inﬂected verb. In 14.47 gus ‘paddle’ is part of a complex predicate involving a typical instrument
(see §7.2).

14.47 wun ak@s

In 14.48, a series of dependent clauses intervenes between the negator and the inﬂected verb:
these clauses contain information which is contrary to what is expected of the river-dwellers:

occur with n@bay ‘yet’. An anterior complex predicate involving the habitual form copula t@and a sequential form of a verb is preceded by ak@s as shown in 14.49 (a non-habitual negated
anterior complex predicate is at 14.32). Any alternative ordering of ak@s and the inﬂected verb
in such structures appears contrived.

The negators ma: and ak@s share some similarities in terms of contiguity in negative constructions; but are not identical in their properties. Unlike ma:, the negator ak@s is not used
to negate non-verbs on their own—that is, without a copula (see 14.44). Consequently, it is
not used to negate a nominal constituent in the way ma: is employed (see 14.41). Neither is it
used as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’. The negator ak@s can be used elliptically, meaning
‘never’: in its second occurrence in 14.50, ‘never’ is an elliptic clause recapitulating the previous
clause:

neg.hab no.way neg.hab throw-down-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt
‘This salt of ours they would never throw (into their food), never, never ever would they
throw (salt in their food)’
The general non-habitual negator ma: and the habitual negator ak@s are both used as proclauses in elliptical replies—see 14.51 and 14.42.
yaki k@-kwa-na-ñ@n?
ak@s
14.51 ñ@n

‘ “Do you usually smoke?” “Never!” ’
Further similarities and diﬀerences between ma: and ak@s are addressed in §14.6.
The same negator, ak@s, is used to negate irrealis in main clauses, and in counterfactual
conditional clauses, and to negate the optative mood—this is the topic of the next section.14.3 ne gat i o n o f n o n- i n d i c at i v e m o da l i t i e s
All of the non-indicative modalities discussed in Chapter 13 can be negated, with the exception
of the frustrative. Irrealis and optative, on the one hand, and same-subject purposive and
desiderative, on the other, are negated in the same way (§§14.3.1–2). Diﬀerent-subject purposive
is negated in the same way as any verbal predicate in a non-main clause—see §14.3.2 and §14.5.
The negation of nominalizations as predicate heads is addressed in §14.3.3.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"19.2 Relative clauses473This creates an unusual clause type, only found in relative clauses involving relativization of
possessor.
From a semantic point of view, the phenomenon of ‘extraction’ of an inalienably possessed
noun and change in its argument status is akin to the phenomenon known as double object
construction. For instance, in Tariana (Arawak: Aikhenvald 2003: 156–7) if a possessive construction containing a body part or any inalienably possessed item is in a non-subject function
in a clause, both possessor and the possessee acquire the non-subject case marking and are
treated as objects. In constructions known as ‘external possession’, the possessor is coded as a
‘core grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains’
the possessee (see Payne and Barshi 1999: 3).
We have just seen that in Manambu, relative clauses involving possession with a close
link between the possessor and the possessee have the surface structure of either double
subject or double object. And the relativization in Manambu appears to go against the NP
accessibility hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977): the hierarchy predicts that if a
language allows relativization on possessors, it should also allow relativization on arguments
of adpositions. However, the analysis above suggests that in Manambu possessors need to be
transformed into either a subject or an object (depending on the function of the possessive
construction in the main clause), before they can be relativized. Possessors as such cannot
be relativized on. That is, relativization in Manambu does in fact conform to the hierarchy
suggested by Keenan and Comrie.
If there is a close association between the process and the result, the ‘associated result’ can
also be relativized on. This is illustrated in 19.19: the man looked into the house and saw the
ﬁre lit by the woman (CA is O in the relative clause and in the main clause), and also saw what
literally translates as ‘the smoke that she was cooking’—that is, the smoke associated with, or
coming from, her cooking:

‘He saw inside (the house) the ﬁre lit by that old woman, the smoke of her cooking (lit.
cooking she-do smoke, or the smoke associated with her doing cooking)’
Along similar lines, 19.20 literally translates as ‘these are the pictures which they spoke at
a name debate called “saki” ’, meaning ‘these are the pictures to do with (that is, taken at the
time of) a name debate “saki” ’:

kayik]-adi
name.debate speak-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt picture-3plnom
‘These are the pictures of them speaking at the name debate “saki” ’ (lit. name debate
they-speak pictures)
There are no grammatical restrictions on the nature of an associated participant.
Since any core argument can be relativized on, ambiguity may arise: 19.21 allows for two
interpretations—since both participants, the man and his companion, are marked with the
same third person singular masculine cross-referencing:47419 Other Dependent Clauses19.21 k@-d@

‘This companion of his said to that man whom he was about to hit: “I won’t hit you” ’
In the context of the story, only the second reading is appropriate. If the common argument
and the core argument(s) of the main clause require diﬀerent gender and number marking, no
ambiguity arises—see 19.28.
Overt expression of participants in a relative clause is an alternative way of disambiguating
the role of the CA. A clause kwa-na-d-@ wi (stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house) is ambiguous: adding an additional argument allows us to disambiguate between ‘a house that stays (is
located) on a hill’ and ‘a house where someone stays’:

wi]-ad
man stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
‘It is a house where a man stays (lives)’
Any relative clause can be used without a head. If the head is omitted, the verb takes the
case marking which the common argument would have taken had it been there. In 14.122 the
headless relative clause, ‘(people) who do not work’, is in the A function of a main clause,
and in T2.67 (‘those we were talking about’) it is in S function. A dative case-marked headless
relative clause is illustrated in 19.23a. The omitted common argument is in the O function in
the relative clause, and in the function of second argument of the complex verb ‘ask’ which
requires dative marking:
[a-di

laku-mar-tua-di:k]

‘I will ask later about (the ones) I do not understand’
If the CA had not been omitted, it would have taken the dative case:

‘I will ask later about words I do not understand’
And in 19.24a the omitted CA is an S in the relative clause. In the main clause it is a location,
marked with the comitative case (see §7.9). Since the CA is omitted, the case marking goes onto
the verb.
19.24a [a

tamiya-wa]
mæy
dem.dist.fem.sg pot sit-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area+lk-com come.impv
‘Come by the area where that pot sits’
This is how what looks like a fully inﬂected verb can take a case marker (see §7.11, for
the discussion of case marking on verbs). A similar example is in T3.43, with a headless
relative clause ata wa-tua-di-a-wa (then say-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt-lk-com) ‘with those (the
words) which I was saying’.
We can recall, from 19.7–8, that a relative clause follows a demonstrative and precedes an
adjective modifying a common argument. This same order holds if the CA is omitted, as in
19.25. The CA is the O function in both relative and main clause:

A headless relative clause in an elliptical sentence looks exactly like a main clause would
look. A speaker heard a woman shout from the next-door house, and asked S@-k@-l-al? (whoobl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘Who is this?’ Gemaj answered 19.26:
19.26 anaki

dem.curr.rel+across.away house+lk+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘(It is the one who) lives in previously mentioned the house across from us (meaning our
next-door neighbour Esther-Yuaya:b)’
An alternative interpretation for this clause could have been ‘She lives in previously mentioned the house across from us’; but this interpretation would not have made sense under
the circumstances. That is, a headless relative clause—if it is not negated—can sometimes be
distinguished from a main clause by context only. If it is negated, it takes the dependent clause
negator -ma:r- which a normal main clause does not take (except under special circumstances:
§14.5.3). In addition, all relative clauses, including headless ones, can be used as complementation strategies—see §19.8.
Relative clauses are very common in every genre of Manambu. An alternative strategy is
verb-noun compounds.","[499, 500, 501, 502]"
"844 Word ClassesThe choice between t@- and r @- as existential verbs is partly determined by the nature of
the copula subject. Similarly to many languages of Papua New Guinea (see Aikhenvald 2000:
166–9 for an overview), the verb t@- ‘stand’ is used with referents which are prototypically
vertical—humans, spirits, animate beings, and trees. The verb r @- ‘sit’ is used with large, squat,
inanimate referents, such as ‘pan’ in 4.19. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs—see §17.2.3
for arguments against the analysis of Manambu copula as purely classiﬁcatory. The verb t@can optionally replace r @- as an existential. Both t@- and r @- have one suppletive imperative
ada.
The copula r@- ‘sit’ can take the adjective yara ‘well’ as its copula complement, e.g. yara r@na-wun ‘I am ﬁne’; as well as a number of nouns marked with the locative case, e.g. stua-m r@(store-loc sit) ‘be for sale in a store’ (see §17.2.3).
3. The copula kwa- ‘stay’ is used with some adjectives and nouns as copula complement, e.g.
yara ‘well’, as in 4.20, an answer to a conventional question ‘are you ﬁne’? The use of kwa- as
an auxiliary is discussed in §17.2.1; its use in lexicalized complex verbs is addressed in §17.3.
4.20 yara kwa-na-wun
well stay-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am ﬁne’
4. The copula yi- occurs with a few abstract nouns, such as suan ‘diﬃcult’ in 4.7 and 13.80,
and some onomatopoeic-like expressions, e.g. kr@sakr@s (scratchy) in 4.21. Similarly to the
polyfunctional verbs discussed so far, yi- can be interpreted as a support verb as well as an
existential copula. Unlike the verbs under 6–10 below, yi-can also be used as an open-class
verb.

I-lk throat ‘scratchy’ be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘My throat is scratchy’
This same verb is used with the nominal s@kul@k ‘cooking’ to mean ‘cook’. This construction
can be used without a second argument (‘do the cooking’) or with a second argument (‘cook
something’). However, just as with the verb t@- in the meaning ‘have’, this second argument is
not an object: it cannot be cross-referenced or referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative.
The verb yi- in combination with kwas@k (possibly, a dative case form of the adjective kwasa
‘small’) means ‘be unwilling to do something, or be tired of someone or something’ (kwas@k
can be replaced by Tok Pisin les, as in 22.35). It takes an additional, non-O, NP argument in
the dative case, as in 4.22. Or it can occur with a postposed irrealis complement clause, as in
13.81. This behaviour is somewhat unusual in Manambu (where the matrix verb tends to be
sentence ﬁnal: see §20.2 on discourse motivations for the constituent order).

‘I am fed up with her’
The copula yi- has the same form as the intransitive verb yi- ‘go’ and the transitive verb yi‘say, speak’ (see §21.1.3 on the syntactic diﬀerences between speech verbs in Manambu). These
three verbs share all forms, except the imperative: as we will see in §13.1, the verb ‘go’ has a
suppletive imperative ma:y, while the verb ‘say’ and the copula share a regular imperative a-y.
Given that, cross-linguistically, the verb ‘say’ often becomes a copula, we hypothesize that the4.2 Verbs85two could be linked in Manambu. The component yi- as V1 in a few compound verbs (§15.2.3),
e.g. yi-pa:kw- ‘hide something’ (where pa:kw- means ‘be hidden’), is also likely to be connected
to the verb ‘say’.
5. The verb kur- occurs as a copula verb in the meaning of ‘become fully, reach, arrive to be
something’, as in 4.23. Its copula complement is always a noun.
4.23 du-a-ñan
ata kur@-d

‘He then reached the stage of being a boy’
This verb is also used as a transitive lexical verb meaning ‘do, make, get, take, procure’, e.g.
yawi kur- (work do-) ‘work, do a job’. With a same-subject purposive lexical verb, it forms an
imminent construction, ‘be about to’ (§17.1.2), as in kiya-k kur- (die-purp.ss do/get-) ‘be about
to die’.
As mentioned above, the remaining ﬁve verbs are inherently ambiguous in their status: they
can be equally well interpreted either as existential verbs, or as support verbs each used with a
limited number of nominals. For each of these, the ‘experiencer’ can be optionally added; this
is why it is in brackets. Without the overt subject, 4.24 means ‘it is hot’ (in general); 4.25 means
‘it is cold’ (in general), and examples at 4.26 refer to an unspeciﬁed experiencer (also see §17.2).
6. The copula or support verb na- takes physical states, natural phenomena, ideophones, and
expressives as its complements (also see 4.81).
4.24 (wun) bwiyabwi na-na
(I)

be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It is hot’, ‘I am hot’

4.25 (wun) n@k@r tay-na
(I)
cold be:clim-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It is cold’, ‘I am cold’
8. The copula or support verb yas@-/yasa- occurs with nouns referring to physical states and
desires. These include ka:m ‘hunger’, gu ‘water’, and kwa:l ‘neck’ (Yuanab dialect) meaning
‘feel thirsty’, s@ ‘sleep’, wus ‘urine’, di ‘shit’, and ñiki ‘blood’ (for ‘feeling reckless’).
4.26a (wun) ka:m yas@-na
(I)
hunger be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am hungry’

"2.5.2 When one grammatical word corresponds to more than
one phonological word
Instances of one grammatical word forming several phonological words include (Ia) nominal
and verbal compounds, (Ib) full reduplication of simple roots, and (Ic) reduplication in compounds.
(Ia) Compounding. Disyllabic and trisyllabic nominal compounds (see §9.3) form one phonological word, e.g. du-tá:kw (man-woman) ‘people’, mæn-tá:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’, bapa-tá:kw (moon-lk-woman) ‘lady moon’, takw-a-ñán (woman-lk-child) ‘girl’, m@w-mí (basetree) ‘base of a tree’ (this consists of maw ‘base’ with a reduced vowel (see §4.1.1) and mi522 Phonology‘tree’), r @k-a-s´@ p (dry-lk-skin) ‘dry skin; a person with dry skin’ (see A6 in §2.6, on consonant simpliﬁcation in such compounds). Verb-noun compounds (which are nouns) follow
the same principle, e.g. kiya-dú (die-man) ‘dead man; name of a Manambu football team’
(see §19.2.2). The stress typically falls on the ﬁnal syllable. A compound of three syllables
or more may form two phonological words, e.g. kamí kamná:gw (ﬁsh food) ‘foodstuﬀ’ (the
free form of ‘ﬁsh’ is kami:), babáy dú (maternal.grandparent man) ‘maternal grandfather’.
Alternatively, such a compound may form one word, and have its main stress on the last
syllable of the second component. Then, the ﬁrst component retains a weaker secondary stress
on the erstwhile stressed syllable, e.g. vyak@tà-yak´@ (good/beautiful-fully) ‘very beautiful (e.g.
woman)’.
These compounds form one grammatical word since no other constituent can intervene
between their components. That case inﬂections go at the end of these compounds does not
provide conclusive evidence for grammatical wordhood since case markers always occur at the
end of a noun phrase (§7.1).
A verb compounded with one or two directional markers (§16.1.1) forms one grammatical
word: it takes a single set of inﬂections, and no other constituent can intervene between the
components. Directional compounds form one phonological word if the resulting combination is two or three syllables long, e.g. wa-sakí-n (speak-across-seq) ‘speaking across; telling
traditional lore’, yak@-sú-n (throw-up-seq) ‘throwing upwards’. If the resulting combination
contains four or more syllables, each directional acquires an independent stress, as in yak@sakí-salá-n (throw-across.away-across.inwards-seq) ‘throw across away and inwards at the same
time’. A non-stressed preﬁx does not aﬀect the phonological wordhood, despite the fact
that the resulting word becomes four syllables long, e.g. a-yak@-sú (impv-throw-up) ‘throw
upwards!’ Verb compounds consisting of several verb roots form one phonological and one
grammatical word, e.g. kui-taká- (give-put) ‘give out, hand out’ (see §§15.1–2).
(Ib) Full reduplication of simple roots. If a verbal, an adjectival, or a nominal root
undergoes full reduplication and the resulting structure is four syllables long, it is treated
as two disyllabic phonological words in terms of stress assignment, e.g. kwasá-kwasá (smallred+fem.sg) ‘very small’, wuk´@-wuk´@-k (hear-red-purp) ‘in order to hear’. The stress on the
last phonological word is the same as the non-reduplicated form in isolation, e.g. kwasá ‘small
(fem.sg)’. A sequence of ﬁve syllables resulting from reduplication is divided into a trisyllabic
word and a disyllabic one, as in s@mi-ká-s@mí (long-int-long) ‘very long’ (compare the nonreduplicated form s@mí ‘long’). A longer form will be divided into a sequence of two trisyllabic
words, as in kayk@t´@-kayk@t´@k ‘in order to hold’. A form two or three syllables long will be
treated as one phonological word with a single stress, e.g. da-dá-k ‘in order to go down’, kurkur-´@k ‘in order to do’, t@ p-a-t´@ p (village-lk-village) ‘every village’. That these forms constitute
one grammatical word is corroborated by the fact that they take one marker of inﬂection,
e.g. the purposive -k in reduplicated verbs, and gender and number marking in reduplicated
adjectives, e.g. kw asa-kw asa-d@ ‘small-red-masc.sg’. (Inherently reduplicated disyllabic words
have one stress, e.g. damdá:m ‘spider’; cf. da:m ‘spider’.)
(Ic) Reduplication in compounds. A verb-verb compound, or one of its components, can
undergo full reduplication (see §15.1 on the properties of verb-verb compounds). Then, the
principle of preferred phonological word applies; for instance, the second component of the
compound v@-s@m´@l- (see-dummy.root) ‘look for’ can be reduplicated; the resulting form
consists of two phonological words: v@-s@m´@l-s@m´@l- ‘look everywhere’. If both components
undergo full reduplication, and the initial compound contains more than two syllables, the
last vowel of the ﬁrst component is dropped. The reduplicated components form separate2.5 Phonological word53phonological words. So, full reduplication of kui-taká- produces two phonological words
kui-ták-kui-taká- (give-put-give-put) ‘give away repeatedly, or of many agents’, and not ∗ kuitaká-kui-taká; and that of kiya-yak´@- (die-throw) ‘die irrevocably’ produces kiya-yák-kiyayak´@- ‘die irrevocably, or of many subjects’. No other kind of compound can undergo full
reduplication (see §12.8.2; §15.5).","[78, 79, 80]"

d@y, dayNo cross-referencing is found in negative declarative non-habitual clauses, in positive completive and customary aspects and in a variety of non-declarative forms including prohibitive,
desiderative, and frustrative, and all same-subject medial clauses. These forms are uninﬂected.
See a summary in Table 11.1.
The number of cross-referencing positions on the verb only marginally relates to mood,
modality, polarity, and aspect. Most of the verbal forms which accept one cross-referencing
position or take no cross-referencing are non-declarative. Most negative forms take no crossreferencing at all.
The number of cross-referencing positions is independent of the verb’s transitivity. It
depends on the pragmatic properties of the non-subject constituent, and not so much the
lexical properties of the verb itself. This is partly reminiscent of Ugric and Samoyedic
languages.
There, a special verbal conjugation (called ‘objective’) is used for transitive verbs if the
object is deﬁnite or topical. A transitive verb with an indeﬁnite object appears in the ‘subjective’ conjugation (see, for instance, Moravcsik 1983 on Hungarian and Nikolaeva 1999 on
Northern Khanty). Diﬀerent sets of cross-referencing suﬃxes in Menya, an Angan language
from Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea (Whitehead 1991), mark more topical, and less
topical, subjects. However, in neither case is there a complete analogy with the Manambu
system.
The marking of A/S as the only cross-referenced constituent (‘basic’ marking set) is the same
as the marking of the second argument if it is more topical than the subject. This may seem
reminiscent of split ergativity whereby, under certain conditions, the S constituent (the only

a transitive verb). 1 However, the Manambu pattern is only superﬁcially similar to this, since:
(a) the basic cross-referencing set marks A/S and also O, a locative, a manner, or a time
constituent, that is, it is hardly comparable with a ‘real’ ergative/absolutive system, with
an opposition between S/O and A; and
(b) the occurrence of the marking is conditioned by the topicality of the participant and
only partly by its grammatical function (we can recall that some relations, such as copula
complement, or comitative, are never cross-referenced).
The closest analogy to the Manambu system comes from Alamblak (Sepik Hill: Bruce 1984:
184–8, 216–30). Here, an argument additional to the subject can be cross-referenced on the
verb ‘if it can be thought of as a crucial participant in the situation’ (219). Just as in Manambu,
the second argument marker follows the marker of the subject. However, unlike Manambu,
the same set of markers cross-references both arguments, and there are no special sets for nonverbal predicates. It is not clear whether there are any types of arguments which can never be
cross-referenced. Sare (or Kapriman), also from the Sepik Hill family, does not have this feature
(Sumbuk 1999). Is this similarity between Manambu and Alamblak a simple coincidence? Or,
given that some Manambu subclans claim their origins to be in the area of Chambri lake—
to the south of which Alamblak is spoken (see §1.5.3)—could this be an areal feature? The
question remains open. Also see §§22.2–3, where we return to the issue of areal diﬀusion.
We conclude that, though marking the pragmatic status of constituents through variation in
cross-referencing patterns on the verb is not unprecedented, no other system we know of is
fully comparable with the way Manambu verbs mark their participants.3.2 gramm atical relat ions marked on noun phrases
Cases in Manambu mark grammatical relations on a basic nominative-accusative principle.
Only deﬁnite and completely aﬀected objects are marked with the -Vm case ‘accusative/
locative’ (see §7.3 for a hypothesis concerning the motivation for this case syncretism). Table
3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate with
the marking on verbs as heads of predicates.
Table 3.5 shows that grammatical functions covered by the second-position cross-referencing
suﬃxes only somewhat overlap with the ones covered by cases. The case syncretism does not
fully coincide with the syncretism of meanings available for the basic cross-referencing set
when it refers to a non-subject constituent. We can recall that this may refer to location (for
which three cases are available: a location can be unmarked, marked with a locative case or
the terminative case); to an object (one case available), or to an instrument or manner (one
case available). This illustrates one-to-many correspondences in the relationship between crossreferencing on the verb and case marking on nouns. Case meanings below the thick line in
Table 3.5 do not have a cross-referencing correlate: these constituents are not cross-referenced.
An object marked with the accusative/locative case is likely to be a topic, and is crossreferenced more often than an unmarked O, in terms of textual frequency. However, this is not a
1 Instances whereby a language has an ergative pattern of marking grammatical relations depending on the topical
continuity of S/O include Asheninca Campa (an Arawak language from Peru: Payne and Payne (2005) showed how
a split intransitive pattern marks the main story line, or foregrounded actions). In Yagua (Peba-Yagua) and Pajonal
Campa (Arawak), S is marked like O to highlight some new information (but not a new participant) (Dixon 1994:
211).","[91, 92, 93, 94]"
"54220 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesWe saw, at §20.1.3 above, that the interrogative pronoun s@ ‘who’ is obligatorily marked for
focus if it occurs in subject function. This is the only instance of grammaticalized focus whose
occurrence is limited to S and A.
Highlighting focus constructions involving arguments and obliques cannot be negated separately. This is hardly surprising: we can recall that a constituent cannot be negated separately,
without the whole clause being negated.
We now turn to a rather unusual construction whose function is to contrast an action, or
a state, to other actions or states. Such ‘predicate focus’ constructions involve marking a fully
inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate. Note that they cannot involve a predicate
already marked for action focus (§12.2). (If the predicate in ‘predicate focus’ contains an
uninﬂected verb, it requires a support verb—see §17.2.) In 20.87, the speaker is saying that
what they were going to do was to cut the pig, and not anything else. This is framed as predicate
focus—that is, the whole clause is within the scope of the focus. A similar example is at 11.8.
20.87 [au {k@-d@
bal ra-k@-bana-l}-a]
then dem.prox-masc.sg pig cut-fut-1plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {we are going to cut the pig}’ (rather than doing something else)
‘Predicate focus’ structures produced spontaneously often provide an explanation for an
unusual event or state. When we returned to Avatip from an exhausting trip to Swakap, people
would look askance at my bandaged arms. The answer—provided by Yuaneng—was:
20.88 [{Swakapa:r
yi-ba-l}-a]
Swakap+lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {we went to Swakap}’ (and got sunburnt and tired)
A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate can be put in a focus construction,
as a form of a strong statement: a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’.
It is also used as a conversation sustainer, and as a summarizing statement indicating that the
speaker has ﬁnished one point, and may well start on something else.
Such predicate focus constructions cannot contain reactivated topic demonstratives. Neither
do they occur with a non-predicate-ﬁnal constituent order. This is to do with their pragmatic
organization: the event or the resulting state is viewed as a whole, and is thus contrasted to
another event, the participants being of secondary importance.
The diﬀerence between the English translational equivalents in 20.87–8 and 11.8 and the
Manambu structures is that there is no overt subordination marker in Manambu.
If the predicate in a highlighting focus construction is negated, it takes the subordinate
negator -ma:r-. We can recall, from §14.5.3, that this is indeed the most frequent context under
which a predicate of what looks like an independent clause may occur with -ma:r-. This involves
focusing a negated clause. Examples are at 14.134–5, and 20.89a. What makes life in Swakap
unbearable for the people from Avatip and Malu is that:
20.89a [{kwasa
wi
t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]
small+fem.sg house have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {they do not have toilet (small house)}’
This brings us back to the issue of whether highlighting focus involves a cleft or not. In
many languages, focus constructions are expressed via cleft clauses which, in their turn, involve
marking part of a clause as a dependent clause. That a dependent clause negator is used
in focused clauses shows that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent. That
is, at least predicate focus constructions may be considered clefted, but the evidence only20.4 Further issues in discourse organization543becomes apparent if they are negated. And this should not come as a surpise—it is also the
case in relative and juxtaposed dependent clauses whose status as dependent clauses is fully
revealed under negation. Highlighting focus constructions do not involve relative clauses (see
§19.2): the rearrangement of participants typical for possessor relative clauses does not occur
in highlighting focus constructions.
If a constituent in highlighting focus is contrastive, an option is to employ double focus. This
involves adding another nominal cross-referencing marker, as in 20.89b. Here, the fact that they
do not have a toilet is contrasted to the fact that other, more ‘cultured’ people do:
20.89b [{kwasa
wi
small+fem.sg house
t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]-al
have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {they do not really have toilet (small house)}’
The existence of double focus structures demonstrates that focus constructions are diﬀerent
from verbless clauses with non-verbal predicate heads: no non-verbal predicate would take
double cross-referencing, outside the focus construction. Unlike 20.60, where a double focus
structure is obligatory, in 20.89b it is pragmatically determined.
Are highlighting focus constructions monoclausal or biclausal? The evidence goes both
ways. A noun phrase in highlighting focus has the appearance of a full verbless clause, since
it includes non-verbal cross-referencing markers. On the other hand, it is not a full clause
because it cannot be negated separately. It occupies the argument slot of the predicate. And
if it is to be questioned, the question word also has to be cast as a focused constituent.
We conclude that highlighting focus constructions combine features of biclausal and monoclausal constructions, and, just like transitivity-neutralizing constructions involving clause
chaining (§17.5), are an additional instance of grammar-in-the-making. A similar construction
in Iatmul was described by Jendraschek (2006b): their status as bi- or monoclausal is equally
ambiguous.20.4 f u rt h e r i s s u e s i n d i s c o u r s e o rga n i zat i o n
Manambu clauses form sentences which contain one main clause, and sentences combine to
form a paragraph. A paragraph—or a coherent stretch of discourse—is deﬁned as having a
topic of its own, and is normally separated from the next paragraph by a signiﬁcant pause.
As we saw above, a topic usually appears preposed to the predicate. A reactivated topic—
that is, a topic mentioned in a previous stretch of discourse and known to the speaker
and to the addressee, but not mentioned for some time—is marked with reactivated topic
demonstratives (see §10.2.3 and §3.3). This is a powerful device which allows speakers to
handle more than one topic at a time. The ways sentences can be linked together within a
paragraph, or across paragraphs, are addressed in §20.4.1. In §20.4.2 we discuss the function
of ‘boundary-marking’ clauses consisting of ya:kya ‘all right’ and its Tok Pisin equivalent orait
(§20.4.2).
We saw in §20.2 above that constituent order plays its role in identiﬁcation of topical participants. Narratives tend to be elaborate in stating participants, while conversational discourse
is highly elliptical, and heavily relies on context. Some of the recurrent principles of ellipsis in
the Manambu discourse are discussed in §20.4.3.","[568, 569, 570]"
"16.1.4 How directionals co-occur
Two bound directionals can occur on one verb. The following combinations have been attested:
(a) -su-sada- (up-down) ‘up and down’, e.g. p@k@-su-sada- (jump-up-down) ‘jump up and
down’, yi-su-sada- ‘go up and down’;
(b) -saki-sala- (across.away-inside) ‘back and forth, across and back’, as in s@-saki-sala(put/plant-across.away-inside) ‘push back and forth, across and back’, vyajib@-saki-sala(pole.forcefully-across.away-inside) ‘pole forcefully across and back’, blak@-saki-sala- (rockacross.away-inside) ‘rock across and back (as a canoe does)’. This combination can have
idiomatic meanings, as in wur-saki-sala- (lift-across.away-inside) ‘sort out (a canoe)’ (see
16.39), and san-saki-sala- (choose-across.away-inside) ‘pick and choose’.
It may also describe reciprocal activities, as in vya-saki-sala- ‘hit (each other) back and forth’,
and wa-saki-sala- (say-across.away-inside) ‘talk back and forth between each other’, as in

(c) -saki-sapra- (across.away-across.towards) ‘back and forth, across away from speaker and
back towards speaker’, as in yak@-saki-sapra- ‘throw across away and across towards speaker’
(playing ball).
(d) -saku-sala- (outwards-inside) ‘outwards and inwards’, as in wapu-saku-sala- (pushoutwards-inside) ‘push in and out’. This combination occurs in an idiomatic expression blasaku-sala- ‘debate; perform ceremonial talk in men’s house’, as in 16.29 (last line).
The general verb m@gi- can occur with any of these directional combinations, e.g. m@gi-sakisala- ‘do whatever back and forth’ (said about a pilot moving gears of a plane in an apparently
random way).
An alternative to having two directionals on one verb is using them in two clauses, as in 16.19
(k@taki . . . k@tapar ‘look across away . . . look across towards’), or in a sequence of predicates,
as vya-saki-n vya-sapra-n (hit-across.away-seq hit-across.towards-seq) ‘hit back and forth,
ﬁght’, s@-saki-n s@-sapra-n ‘move across away and towards speaker’, and 16.35.
A rarely used combination -væki-vala- ‘go across away-across towards’ is attested with verbs
of movement, e.g. p@k@-væki-vala-n (jump-go.across-go.inside?-seq) ‘jumping side to side’. This
could be based on an analogy to -saki-sala-.
The form -sala- occurs only in the combinations of directionals—the only exception
being 16.42. Occasionally, one hears m@gi-saki-n m@gi-sala-n (do.whatever-across.away-seq
do.whatever-inside-seq) as a variant of m@gi-saki-sala- ‘do whatever back and forth’. This is,
in all likelihood, an analogical formation.
None of the inherently directional verbs takes any further directional markers.
The order of co-occurring directionals deserves a mention. If two directional speciﬁcations
follow each other within one clause or one word, the order is typically ‘far’-’close’, similarly to
‘go come’ constructions (see §12.8.2) and -saki-sala-, and not the other way round. It appears
that languages of the world have diﬀerent preferences as to the relative ordering of ‘far’ and
‘close’. For instance, the preferred order in English this and that, here and there, come and go is
opposite to that in Manambu. But the order in Manambu is reminiscent of Tok Pisin go kam.
This question requires an in-depth typological investigation.","[430, 431]"

are at 16.84, 13.24–5, and T2.34.
IV. Apprehensives can be expressed as direct speech reports. In 19.72 a speech report with an
apprehensive meaning contains an irrealis form meaning ‘might’ (see §13.3):
19.72 [aw yaga-di]
[a-di
du-aba:b aw [a-di
a:s

vya-k@-dana-dian]
wa-ku]
hit-irr-3plsubj.vt-1plbas.vt say-compl:ss
‘So they were afraid, men too, lest the dogs might hit them (lit. having said “Those dogs
might hit us” )’
V. The end result of counting is usually expressed as direct speech report, as in 19.73 and
T2.21. Neither of these contains an actual speech report: the child we were talking about in
19.73 did not speak Manambu and was too shy to speak in the presence of a white woman
anyway.
19.73 nabi a:li wa:d
year four say+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
‘He is 4’ (lit. ‘he says four’)
We have seen that speech reports do not have to imply a speech act. However, there are two
major diﬀerences between speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act and those
reports that do.
First, a direct speech report can precede or follow the reporting verb (as we saw in §19.5.1
above) only if the actual speaking took place. If a speech report is used to express any of
the meanings detailed in I–V in this section, it always has to precede the verb ‘say’. Reported
commands as indirect speech reports also have to precede the verb of speech.
Secondly, speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act tend not to be introduced
by a speech introducer ata ‘then’ (see Aikhenvald 2008).
An additional way of making clear that a speech act has actually taken place is by using a
‘framing’ construction illustrated in 19.51. Then, if a speech report follows the framing clause,
another framing clause is often added at the end of the speech report of the kind ‘they said
[Speech Report] having said’. A typical example is at 19.74:19.6 Clause linking involving connectives49319.74 [wa:l ja-k-na-d]

then say+3masc.sgbas.p no
rain neg say-compl:ss
‘ “It will rain”, I said saying, then he said, “No, it won’t rain”, having said’
A speech report which does not imply a speech act cannot be used in such a ‘framing’
construction. Neither can the verb wa- in any of its ditransitive or transitive usages without
a direct speech report; nor if it is used in one of the lexicalized collocations, such as ma: wa‘refuse, reject’ or ya:kya wa- ‘agree’.
Framing constructions are very frequent. They also appear in speech reports in the local
Tok Pisin: one frequently hears a dialogue being reported using a quote frame na em i tok
olsem na em i tok (and he said thus and he said). This apparent redundancy serves a purpose:
it distinguishes speech acts as speech acts from their metaphorical extensions.19.6 c lause linking involving connectives
Connectives involved in linking clauses occupy clause-initial position. Connectives do not
occur in any of the medial clauses discussed in Chapter 18, or dependent clauses in this chapter.
The connective a-l@-k ‘because; this is why’ is an exception: it can occur in a causal clause (as in
19.75). This connective derives from that-fem.sg-DAT ‘for that’ and is employed only if explicit
statement of reason is appropriate:
19.75 [l@ wuk@mar-la]
[al@k
ma:
she forget-3fem.sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p this.is.why again
wa-tua,
a
ma:j]
say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg story
‘She forgot (it), this is why I am telling it again, the story’
A similar example is at 4.16. Alternatively, the connective al@k can be used within a causal
clause, as in 19.76. This is an explanation as to why there is no men’s road and women’s road
in Malu village.

‘So since they do not occupy really big territory, since what is called men’s and women’s
road is small, it is diﬃcult (to have them)’
In T1.16 al@k occurs after the subject wun ‘I’, since the subject is fronted as part of a topicalization strategy (see §20.2). This connective can link sentences as well as clauses as in 18.25,
and T1.22. It often occurs in a main clause preceded by a medial causal clause, as in 18.49 and
19.77, or by another medial clause, as in 18.52.

‘Since it (plane) went down, [this is why] we left our houses’49419 Other Dependent ClausesWe recall, from §18.7, that the connective al@k and the causal medial clause marker -l@k share
their etymology: both come from a dative-marked feminine form of the functionally unmarked
distal demonstrative a-.
We saw in §18.3 that the medial clause form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a
conjunction ‘thus, and so’ when it follows another medial clause (see 18.28). This form is indeed
in the process of grammaticalization as part of a conjunction: al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat
stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’. It is pronounced as one
phonological word. This connective does not occur with causal clauses. An example is in 19.78:
19.78 [sana:k
karab@
ja:p kui-taka-dana-di]

[al@k
this.is.why be-compl.ss neg have.neg
‘They (the neighbouring group) gave away the things from men’s house for money, this
is why they do not have (them anymore)’
The connective aw ‘and then; so; but’ links clauses and sentences. Its meaning may involve
contrast, as in 19.79:
wun ñan ma: t@],
[a-d@-r@b
19.79 [vyak@ta-d],
[aw

lukauti-t@k]
look.after-1duimpv
‘He (the foundling) is nice, and (surprise, surprise: unlike any normal woman) I don’t
have a child, (so) let’s look right after this one’
It occurs as a sentence linker in T2.5–6, and T2.8–9. Also see 19.72 for its sequential
meaning. When repeated, it refers to alternating actions, as in aw yi-n aw ya-n (and.then
go-seq and.then come-seq) ‘on the one hand coming, on the other hand going’ (T3.18). A
similar example, aw war-@n aw da-n (then go.up-seq then go.down-seq) ‘alternately going up
and coming down’ is in T2.8. This same form can link noun phrases, e.g. aw kami: aw lau-lap
(then ﬁsh then ripe-banana) ‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana’ (or both).
The connective a ‘then, as a result’ has a sequential meaning, as in T2.3 and 19.4. It can link
dependent clauses, as in T3.18 where it is similar to aw. It may have an adversative meaning,
roughly translatable as ‘but’, as in 10.22b. The form a probably comes from the feminine distal
demonstrative ‘that’.
Connectives which link sentences within a paragraph are ata ‘then’, and atawata:y (from ata
wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’. The latter is a result of a
recent grammaticalization of ata and a medial clause form of ‘say’. The semantic development
is congruent with the use of wa- ‘say’ to express reason (see §19.5.6). The connective atawata:y is
often used without reference to an actual speech act, as in 18.33 where the speaker talks about
how the Avatip people lived during the Second World War when they had to hide from the
Japanese invaders. Or it may refer cataphorically or anaphorically to an actual speech report,
as in 19.80:

say-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘Thus/this way they lied to him about women (lit. put woman-lie to him), “You will
marry a woman, we will give you a young woman”, thus they said to him’
The connective ata often introduces speech reports which imply actual speech, as can be
seen throughout the texts at the end of this grammar. It typically precedes the verb and never
occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see examples 4.12 and T1.1, T1.8, T1.10, and T1.12). In
the third clause of T1.12 the connective ata is placed after the imperative verb ‘go’; this adds
to the urgency of the command.
Ata can intervene between parts of numerous multiword constituents involving verbs (for
instance, complex predicates: see §17.1–5, and negative constructions: see Chapter 14).
The question of whether the form ata meaning ‘how; thus’ and ata as a negator of desiderative and same-subject purposive (see §14.3.2) are related to each other and to the connective
ata remains open. Several instances of ata in its diﬀerent meanings do not occur; we can recall,
from §10.4, that a repeated form ata ata has just the interrogative meaning ‘how?’
When used in the predicate slot or as part of predicate focus, ata ‘connective’ and ata ‘thus,
how’ take the predicate marker -n (see §10.2.3 on its occurrence with reactivated topic-marking
demonstratives), as in 4.79 and 10.103. No other connective can be focused or head a predicate.
The connective k@pa:b ‘in case’ introduces dependent conditional clauses discussed at §13.7
and §18.8 (examples 13.88, and 18.52). This connective is most probably a terminative case form
of k@ p ‘just’ (§21.2.2). Just like any other connective, k@pa:b occupies a clause-initial position.19.7 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f m a i n c laus e s
Several main clauses can be juxtaposed to one another. Such juxtaposed main clauses do
not have a special rising intonation contour characteristic of dependent juxtaposed clauses
discussed at §19.1. There is usually a short pause between the clauses. Juxtaposition of clauses
has the following semantic eﬀects.
I. A subsequent clause oﬀers a comment or a clariﬁcation to the preceding clause, elaborating
on it. Examples include 19.79, and also 19.9, 19.29, 14.11, 14.12, 14.53, 14.95, 14.97, 14.104, and
T1.9, T1.19–20, T1.22, and T1.28. A similar example is at 19.81: Kuk@lyabau was explaining
that she was a little girl when the Second World War broke out. The fourth clause provides
additional information to the third clause.

rhetorical device, to make sure the hearer understands the point made. Similar examples come
from beginnings and endings of stories—this can be seen in T1.35, T2.68, and T3.1.
II. A subsequent clause oﬀers an alternative, or a correction, to the preceding clause, as in
14.102 and 14.105. If the subsequent clause is cast in irrealis (see §13.3), it acquires an apprehensive meaning—that is, is understood as a warning against something negative. Examples
are at 13.43 and 19.82.

r@-k@-k-la]
sit-irr-irr+3fem.sgsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Turn that plate upside down, or else a ﬂy would sit (on it)’
A juxtaposed irrealis clause can be negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown
in 19.83 (the meaning is that of possible negative consequence). This is unlike irrealis in main
clauses which is negated with the particle ak@s (see §14.3.1); also see 13.35. This suggests that
juxtaposed irrealis clauses could well be treated as a subtype of dependent clauses.

eat-neg.sub-irr-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
‘Wash these plates, (or else) you will not eat the food’
III. If one of the clauses is negated, the relationship between juxtaposed clauses is that of
contrast, as in 14.41, 14.135, and 14.156. Juxtaposition of a positive and a negative clause can
be used as a means of clausal disjunction, as in 7.23.
IV. The subsequent clause marks consequence or reason if it contains an imperative or a
desiderative, as in 13.12, 13.20, 13.23–4, 13.58, 14.31, 14.90, 14.108, and 19.48. Both clauses
can contain either an imperative or a desiderative, as in 19.84.
19.84 [væk akrawul]
[s@kul@k yi-k@r]
pot impv+bring+inside cooking do-des
‘Bring the pot inside (the house), (because) I want to cook’
V. A clause juxtaposed to another clause has a simultaneous temporal meaning if the verb
cross-references time in the second position. This is the case in 19.81 (second clause: ‘(time
when) the war came’) and 9.33. This illustrates the anaphoric or cataphoric function of crossreferencing time in the second position on the verb, which acts as an additional clause-linking
device.
VI. Juxtaposition of clauses may also reﬂect a sequence of actions, as in T1.27. Juxtaposition
of two clauses with positional verbs has a similar eﬀect, e.g. 19.85:
19.85 [wun-a-d@

‘My ancestor kept going up the sago (ﬁelds) (and) settled down (lit. sat) (there)’19.8 Complementation strategies497We will see in §20.1.4 that there are no pivot restrictions on coreferential deletion of arguments
in clause juxtaposition, with just one exception: if juxtaposition of clauses reﬂects a sequence
of actions the subjects are always shared.19.8 c o m p l e m e n tat i o n s t rat e g i e s
Manambu has no complement clauses as a separate clause type. Existing clause types are
used in lieu of complement clauses depending on verb type, the semantics of complement
clause (whether fact or activity, or potential), and the relative tense of the complement clause
(see Dixon 2006, for the basic principles for a typological approach to complementation). A
clausal complement can be in S or O function (but never in A function). These correlations are
summarized in Table 19.4.
We discuss the existing complementation strategies one by one.
I. Completive medial clauses (discussed at §18.3) are used as clausal complements exclusively
in O function, with the verbs of perception such as ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen/obey’ (and
compounds and directional forms involving these: see Chapters 15 and 16). They indicate that
the action of the clausal complement precedes that of the main clause. The semantics of clausal
complement is activity or fact. If the subject of the main clause and of the clausal complement
are diﬀerent, diﬀerent subject forms are employed. Examples are at 19.86–7; also see T2.4,
T3.20, and T3.48.
19.86 [amæy wa-l@-k]

‘After he’d seen that she’d done this because of the eel (her husband killed this eel)’
II. Juxtaposition of main clauses (also see §19.7) is used for a clausal complement in O function with the same verbs of perception. Juxtaposition is used if the action of the complement
is either simultaneous or subsequent to the main clause—in contrast to the completive medial
clauses in I above. Examples of simultaneous action are at 19.48, 19.88–9, 19.93a–b, 19.94, and
also T1.11 and T3.16.

If the action of the clausal complement is subsequent to that of the main clause, it can be
cast in future tense, as in 19.90. Such constructions are polysemous, in that they can denoteTable 19.4 Complementation strategies in Manambu

this is morphological—we can recall, from §13.3, that future morphology is homophonous
with irrealis.

(a) ‘I will see her appear’ (lit, she will appear I will see)
(b) ‘I will see if she appears’
The sentence in 19.90 could also be understood as consisting of a juxtaposed dependent
clause and a main clause (see §19.1), if it had a characteristic intonation contour with sharp
rise on the last word of the juxtaposed clause. Then the reading would have been ‘If she had
appeared I would have seen her/it’. This highlights the importance of intonation.
A juxtaposed main clause can be used in lieu of a clausal complement of verbs ma: wa(no say) ‘refuse’ and ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree’, when they refer to a fact or activity and
involve diﬀerent subjects. We will see, at IV below, that if their subjects are the same, the
same-subject purposive or dative-aversive-marked nominalization will be preferred. Potential meaning entails the use of either diﬀerent-subject purposive or a dative-aversive-marked
nominalization. In 19.91, a fact complement expressed with a juxtaposed clause (clause 1) is
contrasted to a potential complement expressed with a dative-aversive-marked nominalization.

Juxtaposition is also used if the clausal complement is in S function of the verb kus@- ‘ﬁnish’.
The clause which corresponds to the complement often cross-references time or manner in
second position. The main clause takes feminine singular cross-referencing as a default option
(see §5.2.3).

Juxtaposition of a main clause can also be used in lieu of a clausal argument in the O slot of
mental processes: knowing, as in 19.93a–b, and forgetting, as in 19.94. The juxtaposed clause
as a complementation strategy can be preposed or postposed to the clause containing the verb
of mental process:

Finally, one main clause juxtaposed to another may be used in lieu of a clausal argument

In each case, the clause boundary is signalled by an intonation break (less than a second
duration).
III. A relative clause with or without an overtly stated head noun can be used to express
clausal complement referring to a fact, as in 19.96a–b. The way of saying ‘tell me why you
came’ is ‘tell me the reason for which you came’.

‘You tell why you came, so that I listen’
Another way of saying essentially the same thing is 19.96b. The diﬀerence is that in 19.96a
the speaker is requesting the full story concerning the reason of the other person’s coming,
while 19.96b presupposes a simpler statement—a ‘thing’ fought about:
19.96b [warya-bra
ja:p] [ma: la:kw]
ﬁght+come-3dusubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p thing neg know:neg
‘I do not know why (lit. thing) they fought about’
Headless relative clauses, like the one at 19.25 (and 19.23a), can also be interpreted as
complementation strategies. They can express fact or activity. The syntactic context in 19.25
makes it clear that we are dealing with a headless relative clause: the common argument has
been omitted, but the adjective referring to it remains in its position in the noun phrase.
However, we saw above that a headless relative clause can be almost indistinguishable from
a main clause (cf. 19.26). And clause juxtaposition as a complementation strategy may also
be homonymous with a headless relative clause. So, 19.97a is inherently ambiguous between
reading (a), with a juxtaposed clause as a complementation strategy, and reading (b) as a
headless relative clause.

dependent clause negator -ma:r-, and the juxtaposed clause would be negated like any main
clause (§14.5). The negated relative clause is at 19.97b, and a juxtaposed main clause at 19.97c:

(a) ‘Did you understand that I was telling you (what to do)?’
(b) ‘Did you understand what I was telling you?’
IV. Same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if semantically appropriate, as shown in 7.76 and 19.43 (see §19.4.1). Same-subject purposive can also be used as a
complementation strategy with the verb ‘say’ if the subject of the verb expressing purpose or
intention is coreferential with the subject of ‘say’—see 13.45, 19.57 (§19.5.4), and 19.99:

‘When I was a small girl you spoke of marrying me’
V. Different-subject purposive clauses can mark a purpose complement of any verb (see
§19.4.1 and §13.4.2, and 13.54–5). This is also used in indirect commands, as in 19.54 and
13.49. A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: 19.100 is ambiguous between
‘we told them to go to the house’ and ‘we wanted them to go to the house’. This ambiguity can
only be resolved by context.

(a) ‘We told them two to go to the house’
(b) ‘We wanted them two to go to the house’
In 13.51, only the ‘wanting’ reading is appropriate, since there was no speech act involved.
In diﬀerent subject ‘wanting’ constructions, the verb ‘say’ can be omitted, as in 19.101. Then,
there is no ambiguity between ‘telling someone to do something’ and ‘wanting someone to do
something’. Similar examples are at 13.55, and 14.70.

This use of the diﬀerentsubject purposive may be interpreted as an instance of desubordination—whereby the erstwhile
dependent clause becomes a main clause. Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are also used as
complementation strategies with verbs of asking, as in 13.52. An alternative is a direct speech
report, or a reported question, in VI below.
VI. Desiderative clause can mark a purposive complement of any verb—see §19.4.2 and §13.5
and 19.47. Desideratives in dependent clauses in O function can be used as complementation
strategies with potential meaning involving verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ in
19.102:
19.102 [wun tapwuk ba:d k@-k@r] [kwas@k yi-na-d@wun-@k]
I
chicken egg eat-des unwilling go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘I am unwilling to eat chicken egg’
A desiderative clause in the direct speech report slot of the verb wa- is the only way of
reporting non-ﬁrst person’s desire—see 19.58 and 13.57. A desiderative clause can be in the
S slot of a verbless clause—see 13.65.
VII. Direct speech reports framed by the verb wa- ‘say’ can be used as complementation
strategies. We saw in §19.5 above that a direct speech report is a special grammatical relation.
The meanings of direct speech reports range from fact/activity to potential, and can involve
statements, questions, and commands.
VIII. Reported questions can be used as complementation strategies in the O slot of the verb
of knowledge/understanding:
19.103 [wun-aba:b ma: la:kw]
[agwa-mi d@-k@-di t@k@-mi-a-di]

[kas
du-ta:kw
t@-na-di]
I
neg know:neg how.many man-woman be/have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘I do not know how many people they have (in Malu)’
In 19.104, the interrogative quantiﬁer kas is postposed to the noun ‘people’ which is its normal
position (see 10.109–10 in §10.4). Reported questions typically refer to fact or activity. They
are rather rare in discourse of any sort, and may have been calqued from Tok Pisin or even
English.
IX. Nominalizations are widely used as complementation strategies. We can recall, from
§9.1.1, that deverbal nominalizations with Ø-case marking in O function are employed as
complementation strategies, with the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8. A deverbal
nominalization in S function can also serve as a complementation strategy, as in 9.3. A
nominalization can be a complement of a verb ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 4.7, 9.9, 19.43, and T3.20,
T3.33, and T3.35. An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in T3.34 (where
it is negated). These nominalizations always refer to activity or fact.
Deverbal nominalizations marked with dative-aversive case -Vk are used in the O slot of
verbs to do with not wanting, refusing, forbidding, feeling shame, as in 9.5–6, 13.78, and 13.81,
waiting as in 9.4, forgetting as in 13.79, being afraid of doing something, as in 13.82, and in the
sense of ‘for fear of’, as in 9.7 and 13.83, or ordering not to do something, as in 15.111.","[518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529]"

someii. Transitivity patterns of the verb wa- were discussed in §19.5.5. This verb is diﬀerent from
any other verb in the language in that it appears in two ditransitive frames:
(a) with two NP objects meaning telling someone something, as in 19.59–60; and
(b) with a name in what looks like an object slot, and the object or person named as a third
argument, as in T2.3: ‘those whom we call Gala’.
It can also be used as a transitive verb with an NP object if this is something being said,
as in 19.62a–b. And it frequently occurs with a speech report (a special grammatical relation)
and an optional addressee which can be cross-referenced. The only context in which wa- can
be used intransitively is the permissive form wau ‘may I speak?’, a typical turn-taking device.
These transitivity patterns only apply to the underived verb wa-. When accompanied by
directionals, or when used as ﬁrst component in verb compounds, wa- can be used either
transitively or ditransitively (see §4.2.2 and Chapters 15 and 16). And see iv and v below.
In contrast, the verb yi- is always used with an object, while bla- can be considered S=A
ambitransitive, e.g.:56221 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon21.26a ma:j aka
bla-na
speech dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg talk-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She is speaking’ (lit. she is talking speech)
21.26b ab@l
impv+talk
‘Talk!’
Any non-subject argument—provided it is more topical than the subject—can be crossreferenced on both bla- and yi-, in agreement with the general pattern of cross-referencing in
Manambu (see §3.1). The only exceptions are short speech reports framed by yi- which cannot
be cross-referenced.
The diﬀerence between bla- and yi- and other transitive and ambitransitive verbs lies in the
nature and in the marking possibilities of the NP O: only a limited number of NPs can be used,
and their reference is always generic. As a consequence, they can never be case marked.
iii. Types of noun phrases in O function. We saw in §19.5.5 that wa- can occur with a variety
of noun phrases in O function, depending on the frame it is used in. It can also be used with
kudi ‘language’ in the O slot, to refer to a sound made by a non-human (or a baby). If the
sound itself is reproduced it occupies the O slot, as in 19.63 and 21.27:
wa:l
21.27 m@d
[k@dran k@dran k@dran] aka
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say+3fem.sgbas.p
cassowary sound
‘The cassowary said k@ndran k@ndran k@ndran’
The verb bla- takes a limited number of noun phrases as an O: kudi ‘language’, ma:j ‘talk’,
and yanu ‘witchcraft’. The expression yanu bla- refers to performing sorcery, rather than to a
particular speech act. None of these can be case marked; their meaning is generic.
The verb yi- occurs with kudi ‘language’ and yar@k ‘news, announcement’ as O. A frequent
command from mothers to children is 21.28a or 21.28b. Sadly, it is often ignored.
21.28a t@p-a
kudi
ay
village-lk language impv+speak
‘Speak Manambu!’ (lit. village language)
21.28b t@p-a
kudir
ay
village-lk language+instr impv+speak
‘Speak Manambu!’ (lit. village language)
The two are synonymous. Of all the speech verbs, this case alternation has been observed
only for yi-.
The verb wa- forms a number of idiomatic collocations with interjections and adverbs, e.g.
ay wa- (ay say-) ‘let know’, ya:k wa- or ya:kya wa- (OK say-) ‘agree, accept; say OK’. There are
no such idiomatic expressions involving yi- or bla-.
iv. Directional compounds can be formed on wa-. Their meanings are often transparent, e.g.
wa-su- ‘say (something) or call in upward direction’ (as in 16.10, 18.51), wa-sada- (16.6) ‘say
or call (something) in downward direction’, wa-saku- ‘say (something) or call in an outward
direction’ (16.36). One combination is lexicalized. The form wa-saki- contains a directional
bound root -saki- meaning ‘across away from the speaker’. It can have a transparent meaning
‘call across’, as in 16.25. More frequently, however, it refers to telling a traditional story
transmitted across generations, as in T2.68. The expression wa-saki ma:j (speak-across.away21.1 Verb semantics563story) refers to a traditional account of true events, diﬀerent from a blajaya ma:j (speak+come
story) ‘legend, story’.
The verb bla- combines with two directionals in an idiomatic expression bla-saku-sala‘debate; perform ceremonial talk in men’s house’, as in 16.29 (last line), and is rarely used
with any other directionals. The verb yi- is not used with directionals at all.
v. Formation of other verb compounds is limited for all the speech verbs. The verb waoccurs as the ﬁrst component in a number of lexicalized compounds, e.g. wa-t@k- (say-break-)
‘accuse’, wa-yak@- (say-throw-) ‘order’, wa-jali- (say-?) ‘call’, wa-k@ta- (say-try-) ‘ask carefully,
nicely’ (§15.3), and also in wa-karay-kur- (say-bring-do-) ‘be hospitable (to someone)’ and wat@p- (say-be.closed-) ‘forbid, deprive’, as in 15.92–3.
Only those compounds which involve wa- followed by a verb of motion are semantically
predictable: wa-yi- ‘say-go-’ can mean either ‘say and go’, or ‘speak while going’, or ‘keep
saying (or repeating same thing many times over)’ (as in 15.45), and wa-ya- ‘say-come-’ can
only mean ‘keep saying/talking (without repetition)’.
This verb also occurs as V1 in cause-eﬀect compounds involving four verbs in V2 slot: yaga‘be scared’ as in wa-yaga- ‘scare’, j@wi- ‘be awake’ as in wa-j@wi- ‘wake someone up’ (15.59),
la:kw- ‘know’ as in wa-laku ‘give advice’, and buti- ‘fold’ as in wa-buti- ‘fold forcefully or with
care; fold a full length of something, e.g. a long sheet’. In three of these the actual meaning
of ‘saying’ is bleached: ‘scaring’, ‘wakening’, and especially ‘folding’ do not have to involve a
speech act. The element wa- in these four verbs (and a few others discussed at B1 in §15.3.2)
could be a mere homonym of the verb of speech.
The verb yi- ‘say’ does not occur in any compounds as second component. It appears to be
used as a ﬁrst component in one compound, yi-pakw- ‘hide (something)’, where it could act
as a transitivizer (B2 in §15.3.2). However, whether the component yi- in yi-pakw- is indeed
related to the verb ‘say’ or the two forms yi- are simple homonyms remains an open question.
The verb bla- occurs in one aspectual compound as the ﬁrst component (see §15.3.1): blat@p- (speak-be.closed-) means ‘speak for the last time’. It has an idiosyncratic combining form
blaja- which only occurs with -ya- as a durative marker: blaja-ya- (speak-come-), as in blaja-yabana ma:j (speak-come-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt talk) ‘our conversation, what we talk about’
(see §9.3).
vi. Patterns of grammaticalization of wa- may or may not involve its usage as a putative
causative marker in the four verbs mentioned above. The verb wa- has grammaticalized into
a connective atawata:y (from ata wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this
is why’ (see §19.6). The verb yi- may have grammaticalized into a transitivizing morpheme in
yi-pakw- ‘hide something’—however, this is just a hypothesis. The verb bla- shows no tendency
towards grammaticalization.
vii. Idiomatic usage in prohibitions is an exclusive property of the verb wa-: wa-tukwa (sayproh.gen) means either ‘don’t say it, don’t talk (this way)’, or something like ‘say it again, I
can’t agree more with what you are saying’. The frequency of this expression in this meaning in
Manambu is such that some local teenagers transfer this into their English, saying ‘don’t say’
in lieu of ‘say it again’.
No such idiomatic uses have been attested for bla- and yi-: bla-tukwa means ‘shut up, do
not talk (this way)’, and yi-tukwa means ‘don’t say it, do not talk (this way)’. The two strong
prohibitives (see §14.4.1) have no such idiomatic extensions with any of the speech verbs.
viii. Patterns of polysemy/homonymy diﬀerentiate the three speech verbs in a rather dramatic
manner. The verb bla- is the most straightforward: it has no meanings other than those to do56421 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconwith speaking, and no homonyms. (Its origins could well be onomatopoeic.) The verb yi- ‘say’
is homophonous with the verb yi- ‘go’ in all forms but the second person imperative: we can
recall, from §13.2.1, that the verb ‘go’ has a suppletive imperative ma:y (cognate to Ambulas
me) while the verb yi- ‘say’ has a straightforward imperative a-y ‘say!’ The form yi- is also used
as a support verb for some nominals—see §4.2.2 and §§17.2.3–4 (e.g. 17.38). Whether it is the
same polyfunctional verb as the one meaning ‘say’ is an open question.
The verb wa- is the most versatile of all: we saw, in §19.5.6, that it eﬀectively covers a variety
of meanings to do with internal speech, thought, fear, reason, intention, desire, and so on. And
we will see, in §21.4, how it appears with nouns expressing emotions: the person’s inside, mawul,
‘speaks’ (wa-) if a person has an opinion about something.
In summary: the three verbs of speech diﬀer in terms of their syntactic and semantic
properties—despite the fact that they cover pretty similar semantic ground and are fairly
general in their meanings.21.2 p o lys e m y, s p e c i f i c i ty, a n d d i s a m b i g uat i o n: further features

"14.3.2 Negation of same-subject purposive and of desiderative
The same-subject purposive in main clauses and the desiderative are negated with the particle
ata which obligatorily precedes the modal form, and forms an independent phonological and
grammatical word. The negator ata is not used on its own as a pro-clause or a negative
response. The constituent order is ﬁxed: the negator always precedes the verb.
Examples of the negative desiderative are 14.61–2, and the ﬁrst line of 14.65. The negative
desiderative is an uninﬂected verb (just like the positive desiderative), so person, number, and
gender of the subject are not expressed on the verb. If necessary for disambiguation, a personal
pronoun can be supplied, as in 14.61.
ata
k@-k@r
14.61 wun day-a-wa

they-lk-com neg.des eat-des

Example 14.62 is ambiguous: it is a suggestion to a second person, and at the same time a
generic statement:

14.62 ñam
yawi kur-tukwa

ata
væk@r-@k
14.63 ñ@n
you.fem neg.des fall-purp.ss
‘You are not going to fall down’
The negator ata does not have to be contiguous with the desiderative or the purposive. A
part of a complex predicate, as in 14.64–5, or a copula complement, as in 7.75, can intervene
between the negator and the verb, if focused. This is similar to the behaviour of the negators
ma: ‘general non-habitual negator’ and ak@s ‘habitual negator’.

‘Having said, “We do not want to study (lit. sit school), we do not want to learn (lit. get
image)”, the two ran away (from school)’
Neither the negative desiderative nor the negative same-subject purposive occur in nonmain clauses. Neither can be negated if used other than as main clause predicates—a diﬀerent
structure has to be used instead.
For instance, neither of the complex predicates involving the auxiliary kur- ‘do/get’ (illustrated in 13.62 and §17.1.2) can be negated using ata. The predicates are negated using ma:
‘general non-habitual negator’ as a separate pro-clause, as illustrated in 14.66–7. There is an
intonation break and a short pause before ma: which is indicative of a clause boundary.

‘He was about to open (the basket)—nothing’ (meaning: he could not open it)
The negative pro-clause negates the whole clause—that is, the desiderative or the samesubject purposive component of the complex predicate cannot be negated separately.
Same-subject purposive in non-main clauses cannot be negated either. The only way of
expressing negative same-subject purpose is by using the general non-habitual negator ma:
as a separate pro-clause.

A same-subject purposive used in a main clause can be negated with a pro-clause ma:
following the verb form, in an admonitive sense, as in 14.69 where a mother berates her
daughter for not looking after others.
ma:!
14.69 kur-takak
do-put+purp.ss neg
‘You are not going to look after others (you ought to)’
Just as in 14.67–8, the whole clause is within the scope of ma:. There is no other straightforward way of negating the same-subject purposive without negating the whole clause. To
achieve this eﬀect, the clause has to be rephrased.
In contrast, the diﬀerent-subject purposive can be negated, using the dependent clause
negator -ma:r-, in both main and non-main clauses. We can recall, from §13.4.2, that diﬀerentsubject purposive in a main clause implies that something is to be done following the speaker’s
order. The same holds for the negative diﬀerent-subject purposive, as shown in 14.70.","[339, 340]"
"20.1.3 Clause types and their properties
The major clause types in Manambu are (A) declarative, (B) imperative, and (C) interrogative.
Exclamatory clauses have the same structure as declarative clauses; they diﬀer from them
in their sharply falling intonation (§2.7). The imperative is only used in imperative main, or
independent, clauses. Other clauses can be either dependent or independent.
A. Declarative clauses. The major distinguishing features of independent, or main, clauses
and dependent clauses of various types were summarized in Table 19.1. The most prominent
features include:r Constituent order is not necessarily ﬁxed in main clauses (see §20.2) but is almost always
ﬁxed in dependent clauses;r Any word class can head a predicate of main clause, while only verbs can head the predicate of a dependent clause; non-verbs have to occur as copula complements in dependent
clauses;
r The use of uninﬂected modal and aspectual forms is allowed only in main clauses; these
same forms require support verbs when used in dependent clauses;
r Main clauses distinguish future negation, past negation, habitual negation (and also see
Chapter 14), while all the dependent clauses are negated with -ma:r- ‘dependent clause
negator’.
That uninﬂected modal and aspectual forms require support verbs when used in dependent
clauses indicates that they are less ‘verbal’ and more noun-like than inﬂected verbs. This is a
property they share with non-verbs as predicate heads: in order to be used in dependent clauses,
non-verbs have to occur as copula complements of the verb t@- which is also used as the most
frequent support verb (see §17.2)—an example is at 20.26.",[545]

One often hears these demonstratives in conversations where diﬀerent directions are useful
for disambiguating classiﬁcatory relatives in the same relationship to the speaker. For instance,
if I am sitting in a house in a company of classiﬁcatory sisters, I may well refer to one as k@-l-aki
ñamus (dem.prox-fem.sg-across.away younger.sibling) ‘this younger sister sitting across from
me’, and to the other as k@-l-a-wula ñamus (dem.prox-fem.sg-lk-inland younger.sibling) ‘this
younger sister sitting closer to the part of the house further away from the Sepik River than me’.
The ‘close to speaker’ and the distal demonstratives are often used anaphorically, exactly as
in (ii) under A1 above. In 10.37, Katalu announced that the story he was about to tell was to
deal with the previously mentioned place up the river:

‘Today this is it, the story about that (area) up the river’
We have seen that speciﬁcations of additional distance and of direction are not compatible
within one demonstrative. As a result, two demonstratives often occur together in one NP—
one specifying the direction, and the other additional distance. The surface order is always
that illustrated in 10.38: direction ﬁrst, distance second. No other constituents can intervene
between the two demonstratives.

This is the only technique available for combining information about additional distance
and direction in one NP.
B. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish either (i) two degrees of distance
(B1), or (ii) ﬁve directions (B1). A ‘current relevance’ demonstrative refers to an object which
is being talked about, or is known or important to the speakers. It tends to be mentioned just
prior to referring to it with a demonstrative; but more often than not it is part of information
shared by the speech act participants.
B1. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing additional distance are in
Table 10.3.
The ‘far from both speaker and addressee’ ‘current relevance’ demonstrative distinguishes
a further degree of distance—‘very distal’. In contrast to the spatio-temporal demonstratives
discussed in A, the proximate k@- does not have this distance speciﬁcation.
The morpheme -ay has diﬀerent meanings with spatio-temporal and with ‘current relevance’
demonstratives. With the former it has a meaning of ‘further from speaker; or hearer; or both’
(depending on the choice of the stem). With ‘current relevance’ demonstratives it is like a10.2 Demonstratives211Table 10.3 ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing additional distance

-na-awi ‘very far indeed’a- ‘distal’-ay ‘far from speaker and hearer’
-na-awi ‘very far indeed’‘placeholder’ which obligatorily accompanies the marker -na- ‘current relevance’. It is in a
paradigmatic opposition with -awi ‘very far indeed (from both speaker and hearer)’, but only
for the stems k@- and a-. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives often have a locational meaning;
but can also be used as prehead modiﬁers, e.g. k@-na-y k@-l-ay ñan (dem.prox-curr.rel-dist
dem.prox-fem.sg-dist child) ‘this mentioned further away female child’, and also 10.40. A
‘current relevance’ demonstrative can occur with time words: a-na-y nabi (dem.dist-curr.reldist year) means ‘that (past) year we are/were talking about’, and k@-na-y nabi (dem.proxcurr.rel-dist year) refers to ‘this (present) year we are/were talking about’.
‘Current relevance’ demonstratives are semantically complex. The ‘current relevance’ marker
-na- shows that it has been previously mentioned, or talked about, or that it is something the
speaker has in mind. And a demonstrative stem indicates the position of the object with respect
to the speaker or the hearer or both. The ‘relevant’ referent may occur in the previous stretch
of discourse, as in line ﬁve of T3.43: a-na-y (dem.dist-curr.rel-dist) ‘that mentioned’ refers
to the place visited by the character where he claims to have killed all the snakes. The place was
overtly mentioned two clauses earlier.
Or the demonstrative may refer to an object or a place interlocutors can both see at the same
time, and/or have just been talking about, as in 10.39. The ﬁreplace is closer to the speaker than
to the addressee.

‘My spoon is sitting here (on the ﬁreplace we have just been cleaning together)’
Spatio-temporal demonstratives and ‘current relevance’ demonstratives can occur together
in one NP, as in 10.40, and always in this order: a current relevance demonstrative with
no gender or number speciﬁcation occurs ﬁrst and a spatio-temporal one comes next. The
two complement each other, since the ‘current relevance’ demonstrative here does not convey
information about the gender of the noun or the additional distance.

same location—in 10.41 it is the sky. The fact that the moon’s location appears to be close
to us and has just been talked about is reﬂected in the use of k@-na-y ‘this/here-previously
mentioned’. The fact that it is up there in the large (and hence ‘masculine’) sky far away is
reﬂected in the use of a-d-a-wur ‘that masculine up there’.

Or a ‘current relevance’ demonstrative can be added to a spatial demonstrative, to make sure
the addressee realizes that the object pointed at is the one under discussion. Example 10.28 was
rephrased as 10.42:

B2. The ‘current relevance’ demonstratives distinguishing direction are in Table 10.4
These are used similarly to spatial demonstratives distinguishing direction. Example 10.43
is Gemaj’s answer to the question whether there is moonlight outside (so as to help me
decide whether to take a torch with me or not). The question was: bap-a-ta:kw t@ba:m t@na? (moon-lk-woman sky+lk+loc have/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘is the lady moon in the

A location or an object referred to with the ‘current relevance’ demonstrative may not be
overtly mentioned at all—it is enough for it to be in the focus of people’s attention. A mother
used to say 10.44 to her baby daughter to stop her from going into a corner of the house where
the food was stored (located downriver with respect to the Sepik River’s course), believing that
the girl should be scared of imaginary mice:

‘Current relevance’ demonstratives are subtly diﬀerent from anaphoric demonstratives.
Anaphoric demonstratives provide a relationship between a pronoun and ‘another element, in
the same or in an earlier sentence, that supplies its referent’ (Matthews 1997: 18), and ‘are used
for reference to something earlier . . . in discourse’. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives state that
the referent is within the discourse (being mentioned, or talked about), or within the frame of
attention of the participants in a situation. Their scope is thus broader than simple anaphora,
though the analogy between the two is striking.
C. Directional distinctions in nominal demonstratives and in verbs (see Tables 10.5 and
16.1) share a number of similarities, but are rather diﬀerent. (In the majority of cases, verbal
directional markers do not attach directly to the verbal root: they appear on a dummy root
s@-.)
Directional markers on verbs and on demonstratives distinguish directions upward (marked
somewhat diﬀerently), downward, across, outwards, and inwards (all marked similarly). In
addition, directionals with verbs also distinguish motion towards the speaker (absent from
demonstratives), and two types of motion sideways. These diﬀerences can be accounted for by
the fact that directionals on verbs are inherently associated with motion, while with demonstratives they refer to location in space.
While directionals on demonstratives always have spatial reference, those on verbs can
be extended metaphorically and acquire idiosyncratic meaning, e.g. ‘talk-across away from
speaker’ means ‘to tell a traditional story’, and ‘die-across away from speaker’ means ‘half-die,
almost die’. This is discussed in §16.1. In that same section we look at how directional markers
can be used, or avoided, on verbs, and on demonstratives, within one clause.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240]"

The ﬁrst clause is verbless; it contains an instance of the coordinating comitative (see §7.9). In the second

clause has a summarizing function. The next clause is a rare example of a dependent clause with a nonverb-ﬁnal order. The next clause—a medial completive clause—contains the same verb as the preceding
clause. This is a typical example of bridging ‘head-tail’ clause or sentence linkage (as is the third clause
in this sentence: see §20.4.1). Within the second clause, the nominal clause ‘there is another man’ is an
instance of contrastive focus (see §20.3). The last clause is a speech report consisting of the attention

third clauses, with diﬀerent cross-referencing (the addressee, ‘woman’, is cross-referenced on the verb

(see §20.3). Throughout the story we see the polysemy of man and husband (note that there is a separate

Person/genderSgDuPl1-u-t@k-nak2a-3masc-kwa-d3fem-kwa-kwa-b@r-kwa-diThe second person imperative of wa- ‘say’ is áu or áw—that is, after the ﬁnal vowel deletion w can be vocalized as u. The imperative of kui- ‘give to third person’ is a-kwí, with
the stress on the second vowel, and the ﬁrst vowel becoming a glide. The imperative of
kwatiyá- ‘give to non-third person’ is a-kwatáy, with an irregular vowel change in the last
syllable.
Suppletive second person imperative (mentioned in §11.3.2) is found with frequently used
verbs of stance and motion (some of which also occur as copulas in copula clauses). The second
person imperative of r@- ‘sit’ and of t@- ‘stand; have’ is ada. The second person of kwa- ‘stay’
is adakw. Other forms from the imperative paradigm of all these verbs are regular, e.g. rau ‘let
me sit, may I sit’, r @-kwa-d ‘let him sit’; tau ‘let me stand, let me have’, t@-kwa-d ‘let him stand,
let him have’. A list of these verbs is in Table 13.2.
The two stance verbs also used as copulas, r @- and t@-, share one second person imperative
form, as shown in 13.1 and 13.2. The two are distinguished in all other forms.

as a copula and in the meaning ‘say’, the imperative is ay (see §4.2.2).
Verbs with stative meanings, e.g. r@p- ‘be enough’, warsam(a)- ‘be angry’, cannot form a
second person imperative; neither can such copulas as na- ‘be (of abstract states)’, tay- ‘be (of
climate states)’, yasa/@- ‘be (of physical states)’, say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame, pins and
needles)’, and yæy- ‘be (of smells)’. Verb compounds with the second component ya- ‘come’ do
not form second person imperatives.
Unlike the second person imperative, the corresponding ﬁrst and third person forms can be
formed on any verb, including statives.
The formation of ﬁrst person imperatives is straightforward (see §11.3.2 under A, on the
vowel lengthening in monosyllabic roots): the markers listed in Table 13.1 attach to the stem.
These do not appear to be etymologically related to each other. Third person imperatives
contain the suﬃx -kwa accompanied by gender and number markers employed throughout the
language—the masculine singular -d, dual -b@r, and plural -di. Feminine singular form is ø. It
is realized as -l if followed by the optative suﬃx -@u (§13.2.3). This distribution of the feminine
singular allomorphs—whereby ø occurs at the end of a word, and -l occurs if followed by a
vowel—is consistent with §5.1.2 and Table 5.2.
The distinction between three subsets of imperatives—ﬁrst, second, and third person—is
neutralized under negation. We discuss the prohibitives (or negative imperatives), and their
correlations with person, in §14.4.
The second person imperative preﬁx a- has cognates in Iatmul and in Boiken (Freudenburg
1970: 79). The origin of ﬁrst person imperative markers is obscure. The marker of ﬁrst person
dual, -t@k, may be etymologically related to the ﬁrst person dual subject marker of the subject
series, -ta or -t@. The ﬁrst person plural suﬃx -nak does not seem to have any correlates
elsewhere in the language (n could be cognate to -n in ﬁrst person plural pronoun ña-n).
The etymology of the third person imperative marker -kwa may be related to the jussive
-ku in Ambulas and/or to the formative -kwa- in yékwak, an additional marker of third person
imperative in Ambulas (Wilson 1980: 168–9). Another potential cognate is -kwa in just one
second person imperative form in Iatmul: ya-kwa (come-impv) ‘come!’13.2.2 Semantics of imperative
In addition to formal diﬀerences, the three person forms of imperative diﬀer in their semantics.
Second person imperatives are typically used for orders (A); ﬁrst person imperatives often have
permissive overtones (B); and third person imperatives tend to combine these two meanings
(C). These diﬀerences are likely to be due to universal correlations between person value
and the meaning of a command with it. The three persons share just one non-command
function (D).
A. Second person imperatives are typically used for commands and orders. They are extremely
frequent in Manambu discourse. Commands are addressed to people of any age, and especially
to children. Such was the frequency with which the baby Jemima (15 months) kept hearing 13.1
that she started using this construction as a name for chair and bench, in a slightly reduced
form dandá.
If the speaker deems it necessary, the gender and the number for the addressee of second
person imperative can be supplied by a personal pronoun, as in 13.3–4. In 13.3 the imperative
is formed on a complex predicate (in square brackets) consisting of the main verb marked with
the manner suﬃx -n and the auxiliary kwa- ‘stay’ (which has a suppletive imperative adakw).","[303, 304, 305]"
"12.8 Intensive, continuous, and repeated actions265I. An uninﬂected verb marked with the derivational suﬃx -r@b ‘fully’ can head a predicate, as
in 12.40–1:
12.40 [n@k@r-@-k m@y-a kiya-r@b]
cold-lk-dat real-lk die-fully
‘(I) really fully died of cold’
Example 12.41 was the way little Stevie described the light colours on a colour chart which
for him were subsumed under ‘very white’:
12.41 wama-ka-wa:m-adi,
akatawa yi-r@b
white+lk-der-white-3plnom thus
go-fully
‘They are very white, all the way going this way’
As mentioned above, a verb root marked with -r@b often forms one constituent with an
inﬂected form of the same verb root. No constituent except for the connective ata ‘then’ and a
reactivated topic pronoun can intervene between the inﬂected and the uninﬂected components
of a predicate. This justiﬁes treating constructions consisting of -r@b and an inﬂected verb as
complex predicates. The meaning is intensive, ‘fully, straight away’, as in 12.42, with a transitive
verb, and 12.43, with an intransitive one.

ata gra:l
12.43 gra-r@b
cry-fully then cry+3fem.sgbas.p
‘Then she cried strongly straight away’
In 12.44, the suppletive imperative form of the verb ‘go’ appears as the inﬂected component
accompanying the uninﬂected form marked with -r@b:
12.44 yi-r@b
ma:y
go-fully go.impv
‘Go straight away!’
The order of components is ﬁxed. It can only be reversed, if the root + -r@b form is an
afterthought separated from the main clause with a pause, as in 12.45. A normal constituent
order is in 12.46.

12.46 kiya-r@b kiya-k-na
die-fully die-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She will die straight oﬀ (if she falls out of the window)
We can recall, from §9.2 and Table 9.2, that -r@b also occurs on nouns and adjectives, with
similar meanings. Constructions consisting of verb root + -r@b and followed by an inﬂected
form of the same verb are unique to verbs—there is no similar structure for nouns or adjectives.
II. A verb marked with the derivational suﬃx -d@ka ‘only’ means ‘do only and non-stop’, e.g.
bla-d@ka ‘talk non-stop’. A verb marked with -d@ka can be repeated to express continuous26612 Verbal Categoriesand persistent activity, e.g. paku ‘hide’, paku-d@ka paku-d@ka ‘hide continuosly’, bla-d@ka blad@ka ‘talk continuously’, væt@-d@ka væt@-d@ka ‘bite continuously’, wasupu-d@ka wasupu-d@ka
‘gossip non-stop, do nothing but gossip’. Such repeated forms can head the predicate, as in

kamnag@wa

throw-only throw-only ﬁre+lk+com food+lk+com
‘Thus (he was) just throwing and throwing, food into ﬁre’
The uninﬂected verb marked with -d@ka can be repeated more than once, if the action was
taking place over an extended period of time. This is a special property of the suﬃx.

an inﬂected form of the same root, to express persistence and continuity of an activity, as in
12.49–50:
12.49 suku-d@ka suku-d@ka suku-na-wun
write-only write-only write-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘I am writing, writing, writing only’
This is somewhat similar to the constructions with a verb marked with -r@b and followed by
an inﬂected form of the same verb, illustrated in 12.42. The diﬀerence is that the verb itself,
marked with -r@b, is not repeated, while the verb marked with -d@ka is.
The order of components in V+-d@ka constructions is ﬁxed, and no constituent can intervene between components. The meaning is that of increased intensity. So, Israel, with its current
political situation of constant ﬁghting, was referred to as 12.50. Many Manambu people
strongly believe that they are descendants of one of the tribes of Israel; consequently they
have very pronounced feelings in support of this country.
t@p
12.50 warya-d@ka warya-kwa-dana-d@
ﬁght-only ﬁght-hab-3plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt village
‘a place where one does nothing but ﬁghting all the time’
In 12.51, a similar construction expresses a strong prohibition:
12.51 g@ñ@r ya-d@ka
ya-k-wayik!
later come-only come-ep-proh.strong
‘Later do not you dare come any more!’
A form marked with suﬃx -d@ka can be used as the predicate of a subordinate clause, as in
12.52. Here, it is used on the generic completive verb napa- (§18.9) used exclusively in medial
clauses:
12.52 [gu
yaku-n napa-d@ka]
da-k-na-wun
water wash-seq do.after-only go.down-fut-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
‘I will go down only after I have washed’12.8 Intensive, continuous, and repeated actions267Examples like 12.51 and 12.44 show that the meanings conveyed by the suﬃxes -r@b ‘fully’
and -d@ka ‘only’ are not incompatible with imperatives and prohibitives. We saw in 12.34 that
the customary aspect can also occur in commands and prohibitions.
This is in contrast to the completive and the habitual aspect, which cannot occur in commands. However, positive and negative commands with a habitual meaning can be expressed
through using the customary aspect (as in 12.34). That is, an apparent gap in the paradigm of
the habitual aspect can be said to be ﬁlled through using another form. This is in contrast to
the completive aspect which cannot be used in commands.","[291, 292, 293, 294]"

Word Classes
Open word classes in Manambu are nouns (§4.1) and verbs (§4.2) Two subclasses of adjectives
are discussed in §4.3, and §4.4 focuses on the semi-closed class of adverbs. A brief overview of
closed classes is in §4.5.4.1 nouns
All nouns have grammatical categories of gender (Chapter 5), number (Chapter 6), and case
(Chapter 7). Syntactically, a noun can be both head and dependent in possessive constructions
(Chapter 8), head and modiﬁer in an NP, and head of predicate (see §4.3 and §4.4). Derivation
and compounding are discussed in Chapter 9. The types of noun phrases and their features
(including word order) are addressed in Chapter 20, within the context of other multiword
constituents.
Nouns divide into a number of subclasses, in terms of their morphophonological properties
(§,4.1.1) and in terms of semantics and correlating grammatical properties of their referents
(§4.1.2).","[97, 98]"
"48219 Other Dependent ClausesThe same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if this is semantically
appropriate, indicating that the subject of the matrix verb and that of the purpose-marked verb
are identical—see 7.76, 16.75, T1.8, T1.12, and T1.14. Another example is at 19.43:
19.43 [kamna:gw k@ka:k]
[hat t@-na-d]
food
eat+red+purp.ss hard have/be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘It was hard for him to eat food’
Same-subject purposive clauses cannot be negated: the negative pro-clause ma: has to be
used, as in 14.67 and 14.68.
A purposive clause can precede the main clause, as in 19.43, or follow it, as in 19.44. The
order of constituents depends on pragmatics (see Chapter 20). The second line of 19.44 shows
that a purpose clause can appear with a completive clause as its matrix clause. Their subjects
are the same. And the subject of the completive clause is, in its turn, the same as that of the
main, fully inﬂected clause:
[nagw@k

kill-compl.ss eat+red+purp.ss
‘After those seven days ﬁnished, we will go (to fetch) sago, to wash sago, having killed
one (pig) again, for (us) to eat’
The matrix clause for a purposive clause can be a relative clause, as in 19.45. The common
argument is the O of the relative clause and a location in the main clause.
19.45 [ [wi kur@-k]

‘(In) the area which I cleaned to make a house trees have already grown’
Diﬀerent-subject purposive forms are partially inﬂected, exactly like other diﬀerent-subject
forms. A diﬀerent-subject purposive clause can precede or follow the main clause—see 13.51,
13.55, and 19.46.

‘She here is calling, so that the eel should come’
A matrix clause for a diﬀerent-subject purposive clause can be a dependent clause, as in
13.49 where it is employed as a complementation strategy. We return to this in §19.8.
Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are negated with a dependent clause negator -ma:r- (see
14.71), unlike same-subject purposive clauses. This is a crucial diﬀerence between same-subject
and diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses (see §13.4.3).","[508, 509]"
"17.2 Complex predicates containing support verbs43517.2.4 How to choose a support verb for a nominal
The semantic principles behind the assignment of a support verb to particular nominals are not
always straightforward. While ideophones, expressives, and descriptions of natural phenomena
almost exclusively warrant na-, for many nominals referring to physical states the choice
appears to be arbitrary, and the support verb has to be remembered. The nominal wiyaw
‘light and dry’ requires the support verb na-; and the nominal væt ‘heavy’ goes with yi-. The
nominal k@rk@m ‘silent’ requires na-, and its near synonym m@k@m@k requires t@-, as shown
in 17.40.
Alternatively, m@k@m@k (but not k@rk@m) can occur in an aspectual complex verb containing either r@- or kwa- —see 17.39 and 14.117. Both 17.39 and 17.40 have distinct positional
overtones.
m@k@m@k ra:d
17.39 ma:j ma: w@,

17.40 ta:b ku-sada-taka-ku
stand+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
hand put-inside-put-compl.ss silent
‘Having put his hand (inside a pocket) he stood very still’
Two support verbs can sometimes be interchangeable: karkwas yi- and karkwas kur- ‘squabble’ are a case in point. Not so for the nominal kaig@n ‘quiet’ which requires the support verb
t@-, r@-, or kwa- depending on the subject’s position and the aspectual value of the clause, as in
17.41a–c.
t@-na
17.41a kaig@n aka

kwa-na
17.41c kaig@n aka
quiet dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She is staying quiet’ (long time)
If used in the same clause as yi-, kaig@n can only be interpreted as a modiﬁer to yi- in its
meaning ‘go’ as a main verb—see 17.42.
17.42 kaig@n aka
yi-na
quiet dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt

The nominal component of a complex predicate can be questioned, with at@ta ‘how?’ (see
§10.4), as illustrated in 17.43a–b.
kag@l yi-na
17.43a ab-a
head-3fem.sgnom pain ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt

at@ta yi-na?
head-3fem.sgnom how ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Head is what?’ (lit. Head is how?), i.e. ‘What’s the matter with your head?’
This is unlike complex predicates of other kinds, where the non-auxiliary component cannot
be questioned. We can recall, from §4.2.2, that copula clauses are structurally similar to
support verb constructions; moreover, the copula complement shares features with the nominal
component of support verb constructions. The ability of being questioned is one such feature.
An additional complication comes into play. Polyfunctional verbs which form aspectual
and modal complex verbs and occur as support verbs also appear in what can be considered
lexicalized complex predicates. This is the topic of our next section.17.3 l e x i c a l i z e d c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e s
As we saw in the previous section, the choice of a support verb can be fairly unpredictable.
Many support verb constructions are lexicalized. Nominal components of lexicalized complex
predicates vary in their status: some are full nouns, and others have few nominal properties.
For instance, s@kul@k as in s@kul@k yi- (cook go/do) ‘do cooking, cook’ cannot head an NP in
any function other than purpose. Then it is marked with dative case, as in 17.44:
s@kul@k-a:k
17.44 ñ@n
adakw
al@dab
you.fem stay:impv dem.dist+fem.sg+down+term cooking-lk+dat
‘You (feminine) stay right down there, for (the purpose of doing) the cooking’
Whether a nominal component in complex verbs is part of the verb’s argument structure
or not is a diﬃcult question. The meaning of complex verbs is idiomatic to a varying extent.
For instance, the verbs ji- and sakwi- are used only in complex verbs with s@p ‘skin’, meaning
‘be fed up’. The nominal component m@yakw is not used anywhere except with the verb kwa‘stay’; the resulting complex verb meyakw kwa- means ‘like’.
Other complex verbs are semantically transparent. The noun gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water
wash) ‘bathe’ can be interpreted as the unmarked typical location for ‘washing oneself’; sua:l
‘lie, story’ can be interpreted as the object of taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’, in expressions sua:l takaand sua:l kur- ‘to lie’. The verbs yaku- ‘wash’, taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’ are transitive if used on
their own. Complex verbs ‘bathe’ and ‘lie’ are intransitive. That is, a nominal component of a
complex verb may aﬀect the transitivity of the whole.
Numerous complex predicates consist of a nominal which usually cannot head a predicate
on its own, followed by a verb from a closed class. They share the following features:
(i) they form two independent phonological and grammatical words;
(ii) their components tend to be contiguous, and only constituents such as ata ‘then’,
reactivated topic demonstratives, and adverbs can intervene between them;
(iii) the order of components can be reversed as a means of marking afterthought;
(iv) the nominal component cannot be questioned;
(v) the nominal component or the verb can be ellipsed if clear from the context;
(vi) it is often the case that the nominal component is not used elsewhere in the language;
and
(vii) they are translated into Tok Pisin or English as one verb, and when code-switching
takes place they are replaced with a one-word verb.","[461, 462, 463]"

‘The men who went to Avatip are here (close to you) (at) Yuanab’
The verb itself can be complex, e.g. yawi-kur-tami: (work-do-area) ‘area to do work’ in 14.9,
s@-kwa-tami: (sleep-stay-area) in 19.29, gu yaku-swap (water wash-soap) ‘soap for washing
(with water)’, and tugwam na-tami: (clearing be:nat-area) ‘area of clearing in the jungle’ in
19.33.
Whether a complex verb forms one phonological word with the noun or not depends on
the number of syllables in the resulting form. If the resulting form consists of more than
four CV syllables, or two CVC and one CV syllable, it is realized as two phonological words.
Then, the boundaries of phonological and grammatical words coincide. Otherwise, it forms
one phonological word regardless of grammatical word boundaries.
A compound may even involve a verb in a clause-chaining construction which contains
the sequencing suﬃx -n, as in 19.31. The construction is in curly brackets, together with its
directional argument. It consists of three phonological and grammatical words.

The overt arguments of verbs in verb-noun compounds can be case marked as necessary—a
locational argument is marked with locative case in 19.30, direction is marked with allative
in 19.31. An object can be zero marked (as in the second line of 19.31), or marked with the
accusative-locative case, as in the penultimate line of 19.31 (see §7.3, for the discussion of case
marking for objects).
The order of constituents is ﬁxed: nothing, not even the ubiquitous ata ‘then’, can intervene
between the compound and the overtly marked argument. Only one argument can be overtly47819 Other Dependent Clausesexpressed: one cannot say ∗ wun ñaba:r yi-tami: (I Sepik.river+lk+all go-area) ? ‘area for me

"13.4.2 Diﬀerent-subject purposive
Diﬀerent-subject purposive is a partially inﬂected form. It is marked with a non-tensed subject
marker (Table 11.2) followed by the suﬃx -k@k or -k@k@k, whose choice depends on the
syllable weight of the root (see §2.4.2 and Table 2.4). The allomorph -k@k@k is used with light
monosyllabic verb stems of CV structure, e.g. v@-tu-k@k@k (see-1sg-purp.ds) ‘for me to see, so
that I see’, wa-m@n-k@k@k (say-2masc.sg-purp.ds) ‘for you (man) to say, so that you say’ (also
see 15.114b). This allomorph is occasionally pronounced as -k@rk@k by innovative speakers
who avoid a sequence of two adjacent k@ syllables by inserting a rhotic at the end of the ﬁrst
one (see A3 in §2.6).
The other allomorph, -k@k, appears with heavy roots, e.g. waku-tu-k@k (go.out-1sg-purp.ds)
‘for me to go out, so that I go out’, kur-tu-k@k (do/get-1sg-purp.ds) ‘for me to get, so that I
get’, and also in compound verbs, e.g. r @-yi-tu-k@k (sit-go-1sg-purp.ds) ‘for me to keep sitting,
so that I keep sitting’. As a result of tendency towards lenition of k in intervocalic position (see
§2.1.1 and §2.6), -k@k@k can be pronounced as -k@k in rapid speech.
Diﬀerent-subject purposive is most frequently used in non-main clauses, marking a purpose
complement whose subject is diﬀerent from that of the main clause, as in 13.46–7. The purposive verb can be preposed or postposed to the main clause (see §20.2, on constituent order).

‘The elder sibling was digging a hole for them two to go down’
As shown in 13.47, the main clause and a purposive clause can share an object. Their subject is
diﬀerent. The object (‘pig’) belongs to both ‘kill’ and ‘cut’.

him to cut’
The main clause can follow the purposive clause if the action of one clause has no temporal
relationship with the other. Example 13.48 comes from Gemaj’s account of how white men
came to take a picture of her, and of the village, when she was a girl:13.4 Purposive28913.48 wi

Diﬀerent-subject purposive marks the verb in indirect commands. This is the only clear type of
indirect speech report in Manambu; as we will see in §19.5, other speech reports are either
direct or semi-direct (also see Aikhenvald 2008). The diﬀerent-subject purposive is used if
the ‘reporter’ is not involved in the activity (otherwise the same-subject purposive is used: see
13.45). The person shift in the verb ‘stay’ shows that this is an example of indirect speech:

‘After he told the childcare women to stay taking care of those children (the parents went
oﬀ to the lake)’
In 13.50, the subject of indirect command is ﬁrst person:

‘She told us to see (i.e. read) these books she gave (us)’
A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: we will see in §13.5 below
that the desiderative—which is the major means of expressing the idea of wanting something—
cannot imply anyone other than the speaker (also see §19.8).

Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are used as complementation strategies with verbs of
asking (see §19.8), as in 13.52.

Diﬀerent-subject purposive can be used in main clauses whose subject is diﬀerent from that
of a preceding clause. This is in contrast to examples like 7.71 where the same-subject purposive
is used to describe the intention of the same person as the one mentioned in the preceding text.
In 13.53 the cassowary is asking about a participant who has just been mentioned as a diﬀerent
subject. The use of diﬀerent subject is due to the change of speaker.","[315, 316]"

Table 17.1 contrasts the major types of complex predicates (CP) in terms of the following
criteria:
1. Types of inflected verb: polyfunctional verbs are used in complex predicates containing
auxiliaries and support verbs, while lexicalized complex predicates and body part constructions can contain other verbs. This agrees with the major property of polyfunctional
verbs: their ability to be used as grammatical markers.

cannot be formed on stative verbs, or involve non-verbal predicate heads. This sets them
apart from other complex predicates.
3. Role of the inflected verb as a grammatical marker for complex verbs with auxiliaries
and complex verbs with support verbs sets these apart from lexicalized CP and body part
constructions which are largely idiomatic collocations.
4. Combination with other CPs reﬂects the restriction on co-occurrence of CPs with same
polyfunctional verbs, and other restrictions.
5. Omission of inflected verb is a property of most CPs with support verbs and lexicalized
CPs.
6. Strict order of components, or lack thereof, is a property of lexicalized CPs.
7. Variation in cross-referencing depending on focus is a unique property of body part
constructions.
8. Questioning a component separately is a unique property of some CPs containing
support verbs.
Table 17.1 shows that we can distinguish at least four types of complex predicates, in terms of
these properties. In addition, complex predicates with support verbs may divide into additional
subclasses, with CPs containing loan verbs set apart from the rest by the restriction on the
omission of the support verb in main clauses. Unlike any other complex predicates, aspectual
complex predicates can contain two lexical verbs.
A certain amount of unpredictability in the choice of support verbs brings them close to
lexicalized idiomatic complex predicates.","[470, 471, 472]"

inﬂected clause may imply a verbal order, as in 16.79 and 15.110.

‘You order me to go up’ (lit. you order me—I go up)
A biclausal construction involving wa- ‘say’ can also imply intentional—but not forceful—
indirect causation, as in 10.15 (repeated here as 16.80). Kuimagan is rebuking one of his two
wives who had taken a wrong road and is thus responsible for a disaster that had happened
to her son. However, she did not aﬀect the son in any direct way. The assumption is that the
woman had acted intentionally, but not forcefully or directly. These (rare) constructions may
involve a stative verb or an adjective. The causee is not in control.

Cause and consequence is often expressed as speech report (see §19.5); so a speech report
like the one in 16.81 can be considered a causative strategy used for indirect causation. This is
the only way of saying ‘she made me hold it’, or ‘she got me to hold it’. There is no speech act
involved—‘she’ refers to a 9-month-old baby who could not talk yet.

‘She put it (the orange here), so that I would hold it’ (lit. ‘Having said “hold!” she put it

We can recall, from §13.2.2, that imperatives in Manambu have non-command meanings of
consequence and indirect causation (see 13.24). The ﬁrst clause expresses the cause, and the
second clause—cast in imperative—expresses the result or the eﬀect. The ﬁrst clause can also
contain an imperative, as in 16.82 which is the only way of saying ‘make them stay’. Along
similar lines, 16.83 is a natural way of expressing the notion of ‘feeding someone’:
16.82 [kagulu]
[k@-l@-m
r@-kwa-di]
leave+1sgimpv dem.prox-fem.sg-loc sit-impv.3p-pl

‘Give him (the food) to eat; get him to eat the food; feed him’ (lit. don’t worry, give (food)
to him so that he may eat)
Similar examples are at 13.25–7, and 14.108. To express indirect causation, a command may be
cast as a speech report, as in T2.34. Kamkudi gives the starving Sisawi some water, to make his41616 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devicesthroat wet. This is phrased as ‘he gave him water, saying: may this-down-there throat of his be
wet’. In actual fact, there is no indication Kamkudi had said anything at all—the verb ‘say’ is
used as a makeshift causative marker.
Along similar lines, 16.84 means ‘getting her to marry him’. The context of the story
indicates that this ‘getting’ involved more than a simple speech act: the causer did not act
directly, but what he did was intentional.
16.84 [ [d@-k@-k r@-kwa]
[wa-ku] ]
he-obl-dat sit-impv.3p+fem.sg say-compl.ss
‘After he got her to marry him’ (lit. having said may she marry him)’ . . .
A clause-sequencing structure with the verb expressing reason in a non-ﬁnal position can
also be used to express causation. The causee is not in control, and the result is achieved
as a natural consequence. The causation is not direct, but the causer may, or may not, act
intentionally—this depends on the type of the verb stating the ‘reason’. Example 16.85 is
deliberately vague as to whether the man cut the tree intentionally so that someone sitting
on top of it should fall down, or whether he just cut the tree without any such intention:
16.85 [v@l-m@n-@k]
[væk@r-k-na-d]
cut-2masc.sg-compl.ds fall-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘After you cut (the tree), he (the man on top of the tree) will fall down’
To conclude: none of the valency-increasing morphological devices in Manambu is fully
productive. Each has a propensity towards developing unpredictable meanings. As if to compensate for this, Manambu has a wealth of other, syntactic, strategies for expressing causation
without increasing the verb’s valency.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
"19.5.2 Direct speech reports
An overwhelming majority of speech reports in Manambu are direct speech reports. These
tend to reproduce what has been said without any shift in personal, temporal, or spatial deixis.
Direct speech reports are often quotations. And more often than not they convey not just the
words, but the intonation, the look, the gestures, the particular tone of voice, and so on. As
Clark and Gerrig (1990: 772) put it, ‘the internal structure of quotation is really the structure
of what is being depicted, and that can range from the raging of a person to the racket of a
machine’. Examples of direct speech reports with interjections and vocatives are at T1.3, and
T3.40–2 and T3.50.
Reported questions are cast as direct speech reports: see 19.52 and T2.26:
19.52 [ [ñ@ kas]
wa-ku]
[bas sa:d]
sun how.much say-compl:ss ﬁrst plant+3masc.sgbas.p
‘He asked (saying) what time it is’
What looks like a reported question can be used as a complementation strategy, as in
19.103–4. A constituent within a speech report can be questioned, as in 10.113.
Narratives frequently consist of dialogues. The change of speaker is signalled by an intonation break, and a change in a tone of voice; then the actual verb of speech may be mentioned
once at the beginning of a dialogue and subsequently omitted. This is the case in T1.6–7,
T.1.11–12 and T1.23–4.
The verb wa- is the only speech verb which consistently introduces speech reports. A few
other verbs denoting speech acts (most of which are intransitive: see §19.5.5), such as gra‘cry’, ga:m s@- ‘call; serenade’, wa-taka- (say-put) ‘order’, wa-jali- (say-?) ‘call’, can occur in a
dependent medial clause preceding a clause with wa- ‘say’ and then following a direct speech
report, as in 19.49. If the verb of speech is recoverable from the context, it can be omitted.",[512]
"20.1 Major constituents509A pronoun can also be followed by a personal name, as in wun Walinum ‘me Walinum’ and
20.11 (which contains three appositional NPs similar to those in 20.2).
A.Ib. Additional meanings of kinship terms asa:y ‘father’ and amæy ‘mother’ in appositional noun phrases. These have somewhat idiosyncratic meanings. We can recall, from §5.3
and 5.14, that the noun asa:y ‘father’ can be used with or without the adjective ‘big’ as a kind
of augmentative, e.g. numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth) ‘very big tooth’, or simply
asa:y wuk ‘very big tooth’. The noun amæy is also used as a kind of augmentative in amæy ta:b
(mother hand) ‘thumb’. The combination amæy ta:kw (mother wife) refers to the ﬁrst, elder
wife (the term for non-ﬁrst wife is g@ña ta:kw ‘last+lk wife’ (or tail+lk wife), as in T2.50).
A.II. A name of an object (typically, a ritually important one) followed by the word denoting
this object, e.g. Mak@mawi n@b@k ‘Makemawi mountain’ (Manambu name for Ambunti mountain), K@b@nwali kara:b ‘men’s house called Kebenwali’. The ﬁrst noun takes the linker (see
§4.1.1), e.g. Pakan@bra kara:b (Pakaneber+lk men’s.house) ‘men’s house called Pakaneber’,
Waikab-@ kara:b ‘men’s house called Waikab’.
A.III. An appositional construction denoting extension of class consists of a noun followed by
the generic m@wi ‘things like that’. This generic noun is not used anywhere else in the language
(and cannot occur on its own). It is semantically comparable to the associative non-singular
discussed at §6.2.2. And the two are in complementary distribution: we can recall that the
associative non-singular can only be formed on personal names, e.g. Nelma-b@r (Nelma-ass)
‘Nelma and others associated with her’ (6.29). The generic noun m@wi can be used with any
noun, except personal names, deﬁnite nouns, and nouns with a uniquely identiﬁable referent.
A noun phrase containing m@wi is indeﬁnite, and usually has no other modiﬁers (including
quantiﬁers), as in 18.14 (ñapwi m@wi ‘ﬁrewood and things like that’, gu m@wi ‘water and things
like that’), T3.24 and 14.155 (‘children and things like that’), and 20.3:

‘That very one (previously mentioned) (topical) snake having gone (and) killed pigs and
things like that brought (them) to her, so that she should not be hungry’ (lit. having said
‘she might be hungry’)
A noun phrase containing m@wi is one NP and not two coordinated ones, for three reasons.
First, it is pronounced as one intonation unit without any pause. Secondly, no other constituent
can intervene between the two. And thirdly, it takes one case marker at the end of the NP—see
20.4 (these criteria are addressed at E, at the end of the section).

yi
ma:
grass things.like.that+dat-too go:neg neg
‘(One) mustn’t go to get grass and things like that’ (lit. for grass and things like that)
The form m@wi can be used to modify a component of a lexicalized complex predicate (see
§17.3), as in 20.5. This shows that at least some such components are essentially nominal in
nature:51020 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.5 [wi

If a mass noun occurs in a noun phrase with the generic m@wi ‘things like this, things of similar
nature’, the noun phrase requires plural agreement on the verb and on the reactivated topic
demonstrative, as in 6.21.
A.IV. Synonymous noun phrases consist of two near-synonyms (without a linker). These are
rare and are employed as a stylistic device for rhetorical purposes. Unlike the types A.I–III,
the order does not appear to be ﬁxed. In 20.6, ‘(paternal) grandfather’ and ‘ancestor’ refer to
the same person. These terms are almost synonymous: gwa:l on its own can be used to refer to
any paternal ancestor.

‘Having stayed there, he looked around, my grandfather-ancestor’
A similar example is karaki kabay (death.adder snake) ‘the snake death adder’ in T3.3. Both
components of the NP acquire a plural form if they have one, as in 20.7.

‘This is the story of how our ancestors (lit. our grandfathers ancestors) brought (the
people) down by coming’
Appositional noun phrases of this type are very similar to synonymous compounds discussed
under §9.3 (type 4). However, unlike compounds, synonymous appositional NPs form two
grammatical and phonological words.
B. Recognizing the head of a noun phrase. The head of a noun phrase is generally easy to
recognize: it determines number and gender agreement on each of the agreeing modiﬁers (see
§4.3 and §§10.2–3), and cross-referencing on the verb. In 20.2, Kainu is the head of the NP and
is cross-referenced with the masculine singular throughout the noun phrase in brackets, and as
addressee on the verb of speech. As shown in Chapter 7, case markers go onto the head noun
which in most cases is also the last word in a noun phrase. Only the coordinating comitative
behaves diﬀerently: it occurs on each of the coordinands, or just the last one (see §7.9). If the
postposed modiﬁer is a number or a quantiﬁer, the case marking remains on the head noun as
in 7.50 and 10.142 (asa:k viti (dog+lk+dat two) ‘of two dogs’).
C. Noun phrase coordination and disjunction. Noun phrase coordination can be achieved
with a coordinating comitative case -wa (see §7.9), the argument elaboration (inclusory)
construction, or both (§6.2.3). A participant marked with the comitative or its equivalent20.1 Major constituents511(postposition wuk@n) has a lesser role in the joint activity. An alternative is the coordinating
connective wa (§4.5.3 and §7.9). This implies that the conjoined participants are equal, as
in 20.8.
20.8 ata war-b@r
[Lumawad@m wa Parmali]
then go.up-3dubas.p Lumawandem and Parmali
‘Lumawandem and Parmali then went up(stream)’
The connective can also be used in an argument elaboration construction, as in 20.9. This
appears in the speech of those who are highly proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and English, and may well
be a calque.

‘They two mother and son cassowary crossed the hole jumping’ (lit. they two mother
cassowary and child cassowary already crossed the hole well by jumping over it)
The connective wa can occur in a double comitative construction, as an additional mark of
joint activity of both participants, as in 7.79.
There may be a historical connection between the comitative -wa, and the connective wa.
This requires further investigation, as soon as further information on Ndu languages becomes
available. The connective is much rarer in texts and in conversations than any other coordinating device. It is never used to coordinate clauses.
If more than two participants are coordinated, several techniques may be employed. In
20.10, there are ﬁve coordinands (plus the speaker). The noun phrase contains a coordinating
comitative, and the rest of the participants are in apposition to each other. The adverb nakamib
‘together’ (see 6.39 on its use in lieu of argument elaboration constructions) is placed between
the complex noun phrase and the verb which is marked for ﬁrst person plural: the speaker was
among the participants.

‘Abasadu, the little classiﬁcatory granddaughter of my children with Demiyawi, Gabelmag, Yapikudi (and) father, together we went (that time)’
And in 20.11, the connective wa is placed between the last two coordinands. This pattern is
very similar to Tok Pisin and English (in which the speaker was highly proﬁcient). That is, this
may well be a calque from either of these contact languages:

Unlike cotemporaneous clauses and sequencing clauses marked with -n, -taka clauses cannot
head a predicate. They hardly ever occur desubordinated (that is, without a main clause), and
are much less frequent in texts and conversations than medial clauses of other types.18.6 t e m p o ra l ov e r la p m a r k e d w i t h - k@b ‘ a s s o o n a s’
The medial clause suﬃx -k@b is sensitive to the syllable weight of the root, and triggers the
iambic stress pattern (§2.4.2). The suﬃx has two allomorphs: -k@b with heavy roots and -k@k@b with light (CV) roots. A variant of -k@-k@b is -k@r@b (see A3 at §2.6). This suﬃx requires
diﬀerent subject; consequently the resulting verb is partially inﬂected. It indicates that the
action of the dependent clause is immediately followed by that of an adjacent or a main clause,
with a possible short temporal overlap between the two. In 18.43, as the Gala people were
eating ﬁsh (ﬁrst clause), as soon as the Avatip people had approached them (second clause,
marked with -k@b), the Gala started carefully putting together pieces of limbum palm leaves
(to hide the ﬁsh), and gave the Avatip people just coconuts to eat:

‘As they were eating, as soon as the Avatip men came across, they having carefully joined
(pieces) of limbum (to hide the ﬁsh), gave them nothing but coconuts’
A similar example is at T2.15: after the Avatip people had come (to ﬁght the Gala fugitives
hiding on top of the tree), as soon as the Avatip people cut the tree (marked with -k@k@b), while
the Gala people were throwing spears down from the tree, they (the Gala people) hit the shields
of the Avatip men. Further examples are at 10.59, 12.80, and 16.78.
Adjacent clauses marked with -k@b may have diﬀerent subjects, if the verbs are next to each
other as in 18.44 (clauses 4 and 5), or same subjects (as in clauses 5 and 6) if they are not.

Only if adjacent clauses contain the same verb, as in 18.44, are the subjects the same. Note
that they have to be diﬀerent from those of the next clause. The constituent in slashes / / in the
ﬁrst clause in 18.45 is a complex predicate with a prolonged durative meaning (§17.1.1).

This is similar to the behaviour of the diﬀerent-subject completive -k in adjacent clauses:
18.43 is similar to 18.18, and 18.44 is reminiscent of 18.21.
Unlike other medial clause markers, -k@b can combine with -ta:y ‘cotemporaneous’. The
sequence -ta:y-k@b and its variant -ta:y-k@r@b (always in this order) has the same subject as the
following clause, and refers to the action that started before the action of the following clause
and overlaps with it. The subject is the same, because -ta:y is the same-subject marker:

This is the only circumstance when it occurs desubordinated.18.7 c aus a l c lau s e s m a r k e d w i t h -l@k
The predicate of causal clauses takes the suﬃx -l@k which is not switch-reference sensitive.
This suﬃx is a product of recent grammaticalization of the (functionally unmarked) distal
demonstrative feminine dative a-l-@k ‘for that feminine’. We can recall, from §7.4, that causal
meaning is congruent with the meaning of the dative case. The form al@k ‘this is why’ is also
used as a clausal connective (see §19.6).
The causal medial forms diﬀer from all other medial forms. They can be considered fully
inﬂected, because they occur with main clause tensed subject cross-referencing for A/S (see46218 Clause Linking and Dependent ClausesTable 11.2). However, unlike the inﬂected verbs in main clauses, no second argument can be
cross-referenced. Alternatively, the lack of second argument cross-referencing can be understood as Ø-cross-referencing which corresponds to feminine singular basic non-subject. This
agrees with the functionally unmarked character of the feminine singular choice.
This is understandable, from a historical perspective: the second position after the tensed
subject cross-referencing is ‘occupied’ by the ‘reason’ marking. We can conceive of the Ø-crossreferencing as reﬂecting the ‘reason’.
Unlike other medial clauses, dependent causal clauses can contain verbs marked with the
habitual aspect (as in T1.24), and with the action focus, as in 18.48.

Some speakers use non-tensed subject markers—rather than tensed ones—in causal clauses,
thus making them more similar to other dependent clauses. An example is at 14.116—Kulanawi
said kwar-ma:r-tu-l@k (get.neg-neg.dep-1sg-‘because) ‘because I did not get (a letter)’ using
the non-tensed form -tu- rather than -tua (subj.vt) or -tu@ (subj.p). This is in contrast to 18.49
where a more frequent tensed form is used.

Uninﬂected verbs in causal clauses require a support verb. Causal clauses are negated with
the suﬃx -ma:r, just like all other dependent clauses—see 14.55 and 14.116 (this example
contains a causal clause postposed to the main clause). Desubordinated causal clauses are
ungrammatical.
A causal medial clause is compatible with the connective al@k ‘this is why’ in the main
clause—as shown in 18.49. We return to clause linking involving connectives in §19.6.18.8 u n l i k e ly c o n d i t i o n -ga:y
A medial clause marker -ga:y, with the meaning of unlikely condition, ‘if, in an (unlikely) case’,
requires the same subject as that of the following clause and forms an uninﬂected verb. Medial
clauses marked with -ga:y take part in a construction involving the root form of the verb with
the suﬃx -ga:y followed by the same verb in whatever form is appropriate. In 18.50, it is rather
unlikely that we might have to go away; the -ga:y form is followed by future. The ﬁrst clause is
a juxtaposed dependent clause, and is marked with intonation (see §19.1):

‘If (in an unlikely situation) we go tomorrow, we will buy various things in the store’18.9 Generic completive verb napa-463In 18.51, the -ga:y form appears in a dependent medial clause and consequently is followed
by a dependent completive medial verb marked for diﬀerent subject:
18.51 [wa-su-ga:y wa-su-da-k]
[yabi:b wuk@-nak]
call-up-cond call-up-3pl-compl.ds quickly listen/hear-1plimpv
‘Just in case they call up (to the house where we are), let’s quickly listen’
In 13.84, the -ga:y form is followed by a dative-aversive-marked nominalization. No other
constituent can intervene between the verb marked with -ga:y and the other verb. A -ga:y form
cannot be negated. It can be used in a negative construction: 18.52 is an example of the ‘unlikely
condition’ marker occurring in the same clause as a dependent conditional clause introduced
by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ (see §13.7 and §14.5.1). We can recall, from §14.5.1 (especially
example 14.126), that such dependent conditional clauses are negated with a reduplicated
dependent clause negator -marmar-. This same negator appears in 18.52:
18.52 [k@pa:b ya-ga:y

s@kul@k yi-tukwa

go-proh.gen
‘Just in case if they do not come, this is why do not cook a lot of food’
‘Unlikely condition’ clauses are rare in all genres of texts, and in conversations. We will see
in §19.1 how other conditional meanings are expressed.18.9 ge n e r i c c o m p l e t i v e v e r b napaThe completive auxiliary napa- forms a complex predicate with a verb marked with the
sequencing suﬃx -n. No other constituent, including ata ‘then’, can intervene between the two
components. The order can never be reversed: clauses containing napa- are strictly verb ﬁnal.
They cannot be negated. A clause containing napa- can be postposed to the main clause (see
17.25b).
Using the completive auxiliary is a way of emphasizing that the activity or part of it has been
ﬁnished. This strong overtone of ‘over and done with’ associated with napa- was corroborated
by the paraphrases by some consultants. When helping me transcribe a variety of Manambu
narratives, Jennie Kudapa:kw consistently rephrased all the occurrences of napa- with wapa‘leave, stop’. In her own speech, she used napa- and wapa- as synonyms. (A cognate could be
naap in Wosera/Ambulas, meaning ‘fall’.)
Medial clauses containing complex predicates with the completive verb napa- have only
temporal meaning. This is in contrast to completive-marked dependent clauses (§18.3) which
may have a causal meaning: 18.53 refers to temporal sequence, and not to cause-eﬀect, while
18.17 is ambiguous. Complex predicates are in slashes.

suﬃxes -ku (SS)/-k (DS). Further examples are at 12.81, 16.11, 16.39, 17.48, 18.9, and T2.13,
33, 35, and 37.
Other medial clause aﬃxes—with the exception of the unlikely condition marker -ga:y
and the causal -l@k—also occur, but less frequently. In 18.54, a complex predicate with the
completive verb napa- appears in an immediate sequence clause marked with -taka: the focus
is on the completion of the action of eating food followed by washing:

‘As for those foods they brought on just having eaten them, after they’d entered the
water, OK, they went oﬀ’
In 18.55 (a version of the story of the Gala war, similar to that in Text 2), napa- is used with
-ta:y ‘cotemporaneous’. The Gala people who were hiding on top of a tree would have got food
and eaten it down below; this process would be started and completed with some temporal
overlap with the action of climbing back up the tree, to hide:

‘As they have been getting food and things like that (and) eating they climbed up (the
tree where they were hiding)’
Just like aspectual complex predicates (see the end of §17.1.1), a complex predicate with a
completive verb can contain two lexical verbs if they describe aspects of the same action, as
in 18.54. Alternatively, the lexical verb can be repeated as in 18.9. A complex predicate with
a completive verb cannot contain complex predicates of any other sort. A whole napa- clause
can never be repeated.18.10 c laus e c h a i n i n g a n d s e n t e n c e s t ru c t u r e
In a language with extensive clause chaining a sentence contains one main clause and a series
of dependent medial clauses each of which speciﬁes relative tense with respect to the main
clause or to the adjacent clause. The resulting structure can be dauntingly lengthy and complex.
The head-tail linkage between sentences ensures coherence of the text itself, and enables the
listener to keep track of the sequence of subevents. Thus, the sub-events are presented as a
chain structure—each one connected to the next. T2.3–7 are a prime example of such a chain.
The average number of medial clauses per sentence is two to three, as in Texts 1–3. An unusually
long sentence with ﬁve medial clauses (all same subject) is in 18.56, from one of the numerous
versions of the story of Gala wars told by Walinum, a highly proﬁcient story teller.","[486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491]"

Verb Compounding
15.1 a n ov e rv i ew
Manambu has a wide variety of compound verbs which can consist of two or three roots. Their
meanings include cause-eﬀect, sequence of sub-events, and aktionsart. One or two components
can undergo full reduplication (see §12.8.2). Verb compounds form one grammatical and one
phonological word. Their components are strictly contiguous: no other element can intervene
between them.
The components cannot have separate value of tense, aspect, mood, action focus, modality,
or polarity. A compound is marked just once for each of the appropriate categories. All
compounds have fused argument structure: that is, they share all the core and peripheral
arguments. Two identical verbs cannot occur in one compound.
Compounds account for about 20 per cent of verbs in texts and conversations. The productivity of compounds varies, depending on their type. Components of a compound always
occur in a ﬁxed order. The only exception in the corpus is the pair taka-t@p- (put-close) ‘prevent
(from seeing), block’ and t@p@-taka- (close-put) ‘cover (the surface of something); prevent from
seeing’: these only partly overlap in their meanings (see §15.3 (A7 and A8) ).
All these properties are typical of one-word serial verb constructions, of a kind similar to
those found in other languages of the Sepik area (e.g. Yimas and Alamblak), and elsewhere
(e.g. Olutec in Central America and Dâw in Amazonia: a comprehensive typological account
is in Aikhenvald 2006a). What sets the Manambu verb compounds apart from canonical oneword serial verbs is their composition, and their semantics.
A number of components in verb compounds provide manner, aspect, and other speciﬁcations to the major component, but are not used in the language on their own (e.g. -jika‘do properly’, -maki- in gra- ‘cry’, gra-maki- (cry-do.a.lot) ‘cry a lot’). These nonce roots are
treated as verb roots rather than as derivational suﬃxes only for the sake of a uniﬁed analysis of
verb compounding structures. When more information on the lexicon of other Ndu languages
becomes available, we may be able to conﬁrm, or refute, our assumptions about their verbal
origins.
The semantic link between the independent verb and the same form in a compound is often
obscure. For instance, the verb yak@- means ‘throw’, and the compounded root -yak@- means
‘do fully’—the formal match is perfect, but the semantic link is not. The verb ya- means
‘come’. The form -ya- in compounds has two meanings. One, ‘coming; (do) while coming’,
is transparently related to the verb ‘come’, and the other, ‘carry on doing’, is not. We are faced
with the problem of diﬀerentiating polysemous stems from homonyms—a pervasive puzzle
throughout Manambu.
All these features are atypical for serial verbs (see an exhaustive account in Aikhenvald
2006a). The meanings of many compounds are idiomatic and do not follow any straightforward semantic rules. Even those compounds which can be considered productive display
restrictions on one or both components. Some verbs hardly ever occur in compounds. One
verb, ‘see’, has a suppletive form when it occurs as second component in compounding. This15.2 Symmetrical compounds339feature is reminiscent of ‘combining forms’ described in derivational morphology (Aikhenvald
2007), and is atypical of serial verbs. This is why I prefer to analyse Manambu verb sequences
as lexicalized compounds rather than as bona ﬁde serial verbs.
In terms of their composition, Manambu compounds divide into symmetrical and asymmetrical (cross-linguistically, this distinction is encountered in serial verbs, and other multiverb constructions: see Aikhenvald 2006a; Amha and Dimmendaal 2006).
(i) Symmetrical compounds consist of two components, from large open classes, whose
semantic relationship is that of sequence of sub-actions, manner, or cause-eﬀect. Each
has restrictions on the nature and/or the transitivity of one of the components. See §15.2.
(ii) Asymmetrical compounds consist of a verb from a largish open class (‘major’ verb)
followed by a root from a closed class (‘minor’ verb) which provides a meaning to do
with aspect, aktionsart, extent of action, and valency increase, as in k@-kus@- (eat-ﬁnish)
‘ﬁnish eating, eat up’, k@-k@ta- (eat-try) ‘try eating’. See §15.3.
An alternative structure, whereby a ‘minor’ verb from a closed class precedes the ‘major’
verb, is restricted to two ‘minor’ verbs—wa- ‘say’ and yi- ‘go’. Given the restrictions on these
constructions, we cannot exclude the option of their alternative analysis as preﬁxes.
Asymmetrical compounds whose second component is the verb -yi- ‘go’ or -ya- ‘come’ which
provides aspectual speciﬁcation do not occur in the imperative. To be used in a command, they
have to be rephrased with a biclausal structure.
Verb compounds may consist of a symmetrical compound within an asymmetrical one; or of
two asymmetrical compounds. They can never contain more than three verb roots. See §15.4.
The eﬀects of verb root reduplication in compounds are summarized in §15.5 (also see §12.8.2).
Some directionals can be analysed as a subtype of verb compounds—see §16.1.
Verb compounds diﬀer from complex predicates consisting of an uninﬂected form of the
major verb and an inﬂectable auxiliary. Unlike compounds, complex predicates form one
grammatical construction (with one tense, aspect, modality and polarity value), but consist
of two grammatical and phonological words—this is the topic of Chapter 17.15.2 s ymmetrical comp ounds
Symmetrical compounds belong to three broad types: sequencing (§15.2.1), manner (§15.2.2),
and cause-eﬀect (§15.2.3). Semantically non-compositional idiomatic compounds, including
those with nonce roots, are discussed in §15.2.4.","[364, 365, 366]"
"4.3.1 Agreeing and non-agreeing adjectives
The three agreeing adjectives diﬀer somewhat in their agreement properties, and agreement
marking. The two dimension adjectives, n@ma ‘big’ and kwasa ‘small’, agree with the head
noun in gender and number when used as modiﬁers, e.g. n@ma-d@ du (big-masc.sg man) ‘big
man’, n@ma ta:kw (big+fem.sg woman) ‘big woman’, kwasa-d@ du (small-masc.sg man) ‘small
man’, kwasa ta:kw (small+fem.sg woman) ‘small woman’; and also when used as copula
complements, e.g. 4.50. Agreement markers are in bold.

t@-b@r
stand/be-3dubas.p
‘Both the cassowary child and the human child (lit. real child) became grown up’
In contrast, the value adjective yara ‘ﬁne, well-behaved’ agrees in gender with the noun only
when used as a modiﬁer in a noun phrase, e.g. yara-l amæy (ﬁne-fem.sg mother) ‘nice mother’,
yara-d@ du (ﬁne-masc.sg man) ‘good, well-behaved man’, ñ@n-a-di yara-di ñanugw (you.fem.sglk-pl ﬁne-pl children) ‘your ﬁne children’. Unlike with the two dimension adjectives, the
feminine marker is -l and not Ø. Other agreement markers are the same: -d(@) ‘masculine
singular’, -b@r ‘dual’, and -di ‘plural’ (listed in Table 5.1). The agreeing adjectives share gender
and number agreement with modiﬁers from closed classes (§4.5), and also with verbs (see §5.1);
these agreement forms are the same as the ones used in the basic series of agreement (Table 3.1
and Table 5.1). When used as a copula complement, yara does not agree in gender and appears
zero marked, as in 4.20.
The two dimension adjectives can be used on their own without the NP head. Then, if used
in the feminine form, they have two meanings: that of an adjective with the omitted head noun,
as in 4.51, or that of an adverb, as in 4.52.
4.51 kwasa-p@k-a

wau
ya?
perhaps little forget-3fem.sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p speak+1sg.impv emph
‘Perhaps, she forgot a little, may I speak now?’
The two meanings are disambiguated by the context. Example 4.52 could have meant
‘perhaps she forgot a little story’. The comparative meaning of the suﬃx -p@k in 4.51 shows
that kwasa here is an adjective: this suﬃx has a comparative meaning (‘more’) only when used
with an adjective (see Tables 4.2 and 4.3.)
If a modifying adjective modiﬁes either a noun in the function of a copula complement, or
another modiﬁer, some ambiguity may arise, but it is almost always resolved by the context.
A sentence kwasa g@rg@r -a (small+fem.sg tiny-3fem.sgnom) can have two meanings—‘she is a
little bit tiny’ and ‘(she is) a tiny little one’. The ﬁrst reading was judged as strange; this sentence
was used in the second sense.
Along similar lines, an exclamation n@ma kwa:m! (big+fem.sg crazy) could mean two
things—‘hugely crazy’ and ‘crazy big one!’ This sentence was said by Yuamali to her daughter
Kerryanne who was behaving as if she were the same age as her younger sister, the baby Jemima.
And in this context the sentence had the second meaning. The sentence kwasa s@mi-p@k a-kusu! (small+fem.sg long-compar impv-put-up) meant ‘put on (a shirt that is) a little longer (than
another one)’, and not ‘put on (a shirt that is) small and longish’, in the context of Yuaneng
trying T-shirts of diﬀerent length. This second reading would have been perfectly appropriate
in another context.
Note that ambiguity arises only if the order is agreeing adjective-other modiﬁer-noun: n@ma
kru ta:kw (big+fem.sg fat woman) can mean either ‘big fat woman’ or ‘very fat woman; woman
with a lot of fat’. If the order is modiﬁer-agreeing adjective, the agreeing adjective can only be
interpreted as a modiﬁer to the other modiﬁer, as in 4.53:
4.53 kru n@ma
(t@-na)
ta:kw
fat big+fem.sg (have/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) woman
‘a woman (who has) lots of fat’
If an agreeing adjective is used to modify a modiﬁer, only the functionally unmarked
feminine singular form is acceptable (cf. §5.2.3).
All three agreeing adjectives undergo full reduplication; the meaning is intensity, e.g. yarayara-di du-ta:kw (ﬁne-ﬁne-pl man-woman) ‘very ﬁne people’, n@ma-n@ma-di du (big-big-pl
man) ‘very big men’, kwasa-kwasa-di ja:p (small-small-pl thing) ‘tiny little things’. The reduplicated form kwasa-kwasa has an additional meaning of ‘slowly, little by little’, as in 4.54, or
‘carefully’, as in kwasa-kwasa ma:y (small-small go+impv) ‘go carefully’.
4.54 gu
ata k@l@-d,
kwasa-kwasa
water then go.down-3masc.sgbas.p little.fem.sg-little.fem.sg
‘Water receded then, little by little’
When used as an adverbial modiﬁer to verbs and to nouns referring to gradable properties,
kwasa has an additional meaning of ‘almost’, e.g. as in kwasa kiya-k t@-na-wun (little.fem.sg
die-purp have/stand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I was almost going to die’ and kwasa j@pwas
(little+fem.sg initiated.man) ‘an almost initiated man’.
The headless n@ma is used in the meaning of ‘loudly’ with verbs of speech, as in n@ma
yi-tukwa (big+fem.sg speak-proh) ‘do not speak loudly’. To refer to shouting at the top of
one’s voice, one can change the gender on n@ma: in agreement with the meaning of ‘intensity and unusual size’ associated with the masculine gender (as in 5.13), n@ma-d(@)yi-tukwa4.3 Adjectives93(big-masc.sg speak-proh.gen) means ‘do not speak very loudly’. There are no such extensions
for yara.
The combination of kwasa ‘small, little bit’ with n@ma ‘big’ means ‘a little bit big; a little bit
bigger’, e.g. kwasa n@ma-p@k-a wi (little+fem.sg big+fem.sg-compar-lk house) ‘a house that is
a little bigger (than another house)’. If we reverse the order, we obtain an idiomatic expression,
n@ma kwasa, as in n@ma kwasa kwa- (big little stay-) ‘spread the news’. In contrast, yara does
not co-occur with either of the dimension adjectives.
The two agreeing dimension adjectives, ‘big’ and ‘small, little’, have a few further extensions
of meaning. The adjective n@ma often means ‘serious, grave’, e.g. n@ma apaw va:l (big+fem.sg
old.fem mistake) ‘a serious breakage of a taboo’. Especially in combination with ‘old’, ‘big’
means ‘real, really big in a metaphorical sense’, as in n@ma apaw tenkyu (big+fem.sg old.fem
thankyou) ‘really big thankyou’. Both adjectives are ambiguous between comparative size
and comparative age when used with human referents. With other referents (including high
animates, such as dogs and pigs) they refer just to size.
All other adjectives show no agreement in gender or number with the head noun; these cover
dimension, e.g. g@rg@r ‘tiny’, value, e.g. vyak@t ‘good, good-looking’, kuprap ‘bad’, colour, and
few other semantic domains (see Table4.3). Many non-agreeing adjectives can be considered
zero derivations of corresponding nouns, e.g. s@mi ‘length; long’; t@pwi ‘width; wide’ (this
is also a term for a ritual bench); kru ‘fatness; fat’. Colour adjectives rather transparently
correspond to a noun whose referent has that prototypical colour, e.g. wa:m ‘white cockatoo’,
wam-a ‘white’; g@l ‘dark raincloud’, gla ‘dark, black’; ñiki ‘red’, ñiki ‘blood’; væs ‘grass’, væs-a
‘yellow, green (colour of grass)’.
Two colour adjectives contain roots not attested anywhere else in the language: w@la-ka-wal
‘light, white, transparent’ and was@-ka-was ‘yellow’ which contain the intensive -ka- and appear
to be fully reduplicated (see under 5 in §4.3.2). In conversation, one frequently hears colour
terms borrowed from English, e.g. blu or b@lu (and even an intensive derivation blu-ka-blu ‘very
blue; blue like a sky’), and grin ‘green’.
Speakers found it diﬃcult to agree on the term for ‘brown’: juwi-ka-juwi is reportedly used in
the Yuanab variety (based on juwi ‘a type of tree with brownish-reddish berries’), and rejected
as incorrect by others, from both Avatip and Malu. Those prefer to refer to ‘brown’ as s@ pk@t@k
‘like skin’; and to ‘green’ as væs k@t@k ‘like grass’, instead of a derivation laki-ka-laki ‘green’
based on laki ‘ginger’.
A few working sessions with a colour chart revealed an interesting tendency. Both
old and young (5- to 10-year-old) speakers had to use a term for a natural phenomenon displaying an appropriate colour, if they judged the colour terms in Manambu
unsatisfactory. So, a very black colour was termed as ga:n-ad (night-3masc.sgnom) ‘it is
night’, and a bluish-greenish colour as su:-ad (edible.cane-3masc.sg) ‘it is edible cane’;
bright yellow was described as wul@k vya-kwa-dana-l aka (lightning hit-hab-3plsubj.vt+
3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg) ‘this is how the lightning usually
strikes’.
Yet not every non-agreeing adjective is derived from a noun: for instance, the two value
adjectives kuprap ‘bad’ and vyak@t ‘good’ have no corresponding noun; neither do the size
adjective g@r ‘tiny’, the age adjective kul(a), or the ‘intensive property’ adjective m@y ‘real’
(see §21.2.4).
An agreeing dimension adjective always precedes a non-agreeing one within a noun phrase,
as in kwasa ñiki ñan (little+fem.sg red child) ‘little pink baby’, and 4.55 (the NP, in the copula
complement function, is in square brackets). This example also illustrates the absence of gender
and number agreement on the adjective kru.","[118, 119, 120]"

"1607 Case MarkingThe comitative marker -wa attaches to the linker, just like any other case. The only anomaly
is the comitative formed on s@ ‘who’: the comitative is s@ka:wa ‘with whom?’ rather than ∗s@k@-wa, as would be expected following the analogy of d@ ‘he’, d@-k@-wa ‘with him’.
A. Coordinating comitative is the most common means of coordinating two nouns within
one NP. Three options are available here:
A1. Comitative marked once in an np is used to coordinate any two nouns whose referents are
closely linked together, e.g. as co-participants in a story, such as tapwuk-a-wa yayib (roosterlk-com rock.wallaby) ‘rooster and rock wallaby’, waj@-wa sakibag (eel+lk-com wild.taro) ‘eel
and wild taro’, ñanugw-@-wa ta:kw (children-lk-com woman) ‘women and children’, or Y@sana-wa Mayau (Yessan-lk-com Maio) ‘people from Yessan and from Maio’ (representatives of
one group live next door to each other and speak the same language). The expression s@r-a-wa
mu: (tomorrow-lk-com day.after.tomorrow) means not just ‘tomorrow and the day after’, but
can refer to ‘next few days’ as a whole. In contrast, a list of disparate entities does not require
a coordinator.
A coordinating comitative requires dual or plural agreement on the possessive, e.g. Wargaba-wa Wapanab d@ya-k@-di a:s (Wargab.clan-lk-com Wapanab.clan they-obl-pl dog) ‘dog
(names) belonging to the Wargab and the Wapanab clans (lit. Wapanab and Wargab their
names of dogs)’, and on the verb, as in 7.69. (Another example of agreement of coordinate
comitatives with demonstratives, ‘his (two) bow and arrow’, is in 7.71).

ñan] ata kwa-b@r
7.69 [a
dem.dist+fem.sg woman+lk-com she-obl+fem.sg child then stay-3dubas.vt
‘The woman and her child then stayed (there)’
If more than two nouns are coordinated, there are two options: the second and the third nouns
can be juxtaposed to the comitative marked noun, as in 7.70.
7.70 [Kuimag-a-wa Sirunki Lai] ata ya-di
Kuimag-lk-com Sirunki Lai then come-3plbas.vt
‘Kuimag, Sirunki, and Lai came then’
Alternatively, the connective wa can be used, e.g. Elizabet-a-wa Paul wa br@-k@ ñan Sandra
(Elizabeth-lk-com Paul and 3du-obl+fem.sg child Sandra) ‘Elizabeth, Paul, and their daughter Sandra’. The latter option is dispreferred by older and more traditional speakers. In each
case, the plural agreement on the verb indicates that the coordinate NP is one constituent.
There are no restrictions on the function of an NP containing a coordinating comitative of
types A1 and A2. Example 7.71 is an example of an adnominal comitative on the ﬁrst word of
the two NPs, and the dative and the accusative-locative at the end of the respective NPs.

noun phrase); note that the case markers go onto diﬀerent words within an NP constituent.
Coordinate comitative NPs are pronounced as one intonation unit, without a pause. The word
order is ﬁxed, and the NP cannot be split.
A2. Comitative in comitative-marked argument elaboration constructions was discussed
in §6.2.3. The major diﬀerence between such constructions with and without comitative is the
equality of participation: the comitative-marked participant is somewhat backgrounded (see
6.37–9). For innovative speakers highly proﬁcient in Tok Pisin, the comitative postpositions
wuk@n ‘with, together’ (as in 4.69–70 and 7.72) and nakamib (as in 6.39) are synonymous with
the comitative.
A comitative-marked inclusory construction can be in any case function. The case marker
goes onto the cover pronoun, as shown in 7.72. This is in contrast to most other types of NP:
wun-a-wa Yuakalu wuk@n]
7.72 kus@-d@-k
aw [an-a:k
die-3masc.sg-compl.ds then we.two-lk+dat I-lk-com Yuakalu together
an-a:k
kap@-n t@-da-l
aka
we.two-lk+dat wait-seq stay-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
‘After he died, that time they waited for us two, me and Yuakalu’
The word order within the NP is ﬁxed, just as in A1 above.
A3. Double comitative occurs in an NP consisting of two nouns marked with the comitative referring to one participant or event which can be in any function in a clause. Saying
t@p-a-wa kapayawi-a-wa k@-k-na-wun (coconut-lk-com sweet.potato-lk-com eat-fut-act.foc1sgbas.vt) means ‘I will eat coconut and sweet potato together’ referring to eating them
simultaneously (with shaved coconut spread on the sweet potato). In 7.73, m@r @-wa 3 walawa (strong.wind+lk-com rain+lk-com) ‘hurricane; strong wind and heavy rain happening
simultaneously’ triggers singular agreement on the verb. That wa:l ‘rain’ is the head of the
construction is corroborated by the choice of the weather verb j @- ‘to rain’ (see §4.2.2) which
can only be used with ‘rain’, and not with any other phenomenon:
wala-wa]
ata ja:d
7.73 [m@r@-wa
strong.wind+lk-com rain+lk-com then fall.of.rain+3masc.sgbas.p
‘Then there was (lit. rained) a heavy rain with simultaneous wind’
If the two participants are animate, the agreement on the verb is non-singular, as in T3.52
(‘Oselo and the snake the two together died that night’). This is not an inclusory construction:
the double comitative is one NP, and the ‘two together’ is another. There is an intonation break
between the two NPs.
A double comitative construction can consist of any nouns, e.g. amæy-@-wa ñ@n@-wa
(mother-lk-com child+lk-com) ‘mother and child together’, and even of pronouns: when I
showed a picture of myself with Kulanawi, his reaction was: ñ@n-a-wa wun-a-wa! (you.fem-lkcom I-lk-com) ‘you and me together!’ A double comitative construction does not allow any
other case morphology on the same NP.
B. Comitative as associated participant is an oblique, meaning ‘together with’; it is never
cross-referenced on the verb. Unlike adnominal comitative, the marker of the comitative of
associated participant goes on the head of an NP. The comitative-marked NP can be placed
before the verb or after it depending on its topicality: in 7.74 it is postposed to the verb.

This last clause of the story contains a typical ending: when a story ﬁnishes it is understood as ‘going back

the reactivated topic demonstrative is postposed to the verb: see §20.2) between this ending and T2.69:

"19.5 Speech reports489A. wa- ‘say’ as a ditransitive verb can appear in two frames.
First, the verb wa- can take two NP objects meaning ‘telling someone something’, or ‘telling
someone about something’. Its second argument is an addressee. The object (as in 19.1) or the
addressee (as in 19.59) can be cross-referenced in the second position if appropriate.

wa-k@-tua-digur-@k
we-lk+fem.sg village-lk-story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-2plbas.vt-conf
‘I will tell you (many) our village tale’
A similar example is in T2.67. We will see, in §19.8, that wa- in this usage can occur with
a headless relative clause in the O slot used as a complementation strategy. The object is
questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’ (see §10.4) used to question direct objects of any kind
(cf. example 10.84). The verb wa- can also mean ‘promise’, and is then used ditransitively.
The thing ‘promised’ is the object, which can also be questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’

k@dika-n-adika
dem.prox.react.top+pl-pred-react.top+pl
‘Here are the things I promised her’
Secondly, the verb wa- as ditransitive verb can occur with a name in what looks like an object
slot, and the object or person named as a second argument, as in T2.3 (‘those whom we call
Gala’) and in T2.18 (this (man) by that name of Kamkudi), 19.12, and 19.76. In 19.61, it is
used with a reciprocal awarwa in the meaning of ‘address each other as (name)’.
19.61 ñamus
ma:m
awarwa wa-na-b@r
younger.sibling elder.sibling rec
say-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘They two address each other as siblings’ (lit. say younger sibling elder sibling to each
other)
The object or person named can be cross-referenced on the verb, and questioned either with
agwa ja:p ‘what?’, or s@ ‘who?’ (see §10.4). In contrast, the name is never cross-referenced on
the verb. It is questioned with ata ‘how?’, just like NP objects in the examples discussed at B
below, and direct speech reports.
B. wa- ‘say’ as a transitive verb can take an NP object if the NP is something being said, e.g.
‘verse’ in 10.113, or a wrong word in 19.62a. A young girl instructed an older speaker not to
use a Tok Pisin word:
19.62a lukautim wa-tukwa
lukautim say-proh.gen
‘Do not say lukautim!’
It can also be used in describing ways of pronouncing a word, as in 19.62b:
19.62b [n@k@-di ta:kw sajagalavi wa-kwa-na-di]
[n@k@-di ta:kw sag@lawi

saw@ngalawi say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Other women pronounce (lit. say) sajagalawi, other women say sag@lawi, I say
saw@galawi’49019 Other Dependent ClausesThe word for language, kudi, as the object of wa- refers to a typical sound made
by a non-human, e.g. kudi aka wa-na (language dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg speakact.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she (the pot with water boiling) is making a sound’, or t@b kudi wa-na
(sky language speak-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘thunder is sounding’ (lit. sky speaks language).
Alternatively, the sound itself can be reproduced, as in 19.63:
19.63 tapwuk [p@kaka:u]
ada
wa:d
rooster cockadoodledoo dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg say+3masc.sgbas.p
‘The rooster said: “cock-a-doodle-doo” ’, or ‘The rooster sang’
In this use, the verb wa- allows for cross-referencing the addressee, or the time, or the manner
as appropriate, and also the object NP referring to what’s being said. What is being said can be
questioned with ata ‘how’. This is similar to direct speech reports—see C below.
The verb wa- forms a number of idiomatic collocations with interjections and adverbs, e.g.
ay wa- (ay say-) ‘let know’, ya:k wa- or ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree, accept; say OK’. The
combination vyak@ta wa- (good say) means ‘approve’, and ma: wa- means ‘refuse; reject’. These
are lexicalized: the meaning of the whole is not easily deducible from the meanings of the parts.
And the component in the speech report slot cannot be questioned.
A reported command cast as purposive indirect speech report is a purposive clause, of
the type discussed in §19.4 above (see 19.54). It occupies the object slot of the verb wa- as
a transitive verb. If the content of a reported command has to be questioned, ata is used.
Alternatively, a constituent within a purposive clause can be questioned as appropriate (see
§10.4). The ﬁrst person imperative-permissive wa:u ‘may I talk?’ is used intransitively, as a
turn-taking device.
C. wa- ‘say’ with a direct speech report: transitive or ditransitive?
A direct speech report cannot be considered a direct object of the verb wa- since it can never
be cross-referenced on this verb, and has to be questioned with the adverbial interrogative ata
‘how’ or its reduplicated version ata ata. The question at 19.64 can be answered with 19.61,
19.62a–b, or 19.53:
19.64 ata (ata) wa-na?
how
say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘What did she say?’
The same question word can be used to question the sound made by a rooster in 19.63.
An adverbial demonstrative ‘thus’ is used to anaphorically refer to a speech report:
19.65 [mæy, mæy] k@tawa wa-na
come, come like.this say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘ “Come, come”, this is what she said’ (lit. like this she said)
Addressee, time, manner can be cross-referenced on the verb of speech accompanied by a direct
speech report, as in T1.23, T2.7, and T1.26 (see §3.1, for the discussion of cross-referencing).
The speech report can never be cross-referenced.
We can thus conclude that direct speech report is not a prototypical object. However, it
is obligatory, and therefore is to be considered a core argument of the verb ‘say’. It is best
considered a special grammatical relation.
The transitivity patterns described in this section only apply to the underived verb wa-. When
accompanied by directionals, or when used as ﬁrst component in verb compounds, wa- can be
used either transitively or ditransitively, like any other verb which displays this transitivity
alternation (see §4.2.2 and Chapters 15 and 16).","[515, 516, 517]"

Both ‘cessative’ and ‘stop’ reading can be equally appropriate, if the context is suﬃciently
vague. The gist of 15.89 is that the boy had paid his relatives oﬀ and they went away to their
village.

‘As it went on, after they had cut all the trees fully, after he had paid them for the last
time (or: stopped paying them) they went to (their village)’
The verb -t@p(@)- as V2 can also impart the idea of ‘preventing, stopping’ to a number of
compounds, such as taka-t@p- (put-be.closed) means ‘prevent from seeing, close up; cover’. Its
variant is t@p@-taka-. These two appear to be the only examples of permutability of components
in a compound, e.g. 15.90, from a story about why the apawul spirits cannot be seen by human
beings:
15.90 adiya
baw taka-t@p@-la-di
dem.dist.react.top+pl+dem.dist haze put-stop-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
‘The haze covers them (preventing them from being seen)’
Along similar lines, compound væs@-t@p- (walk-be.closed) means ‘prevent (from getting
something, e.g. food)’, and taw-t@p- (stand-be.closed) means ‘prevent, stand in the way’, as
in 15.91:

‘Already since the haze is preventing (standing in the way), they (spirits) are in a haze’
We will now turn to some idiomatic compounds involving -t@p(@)-. The compound wa-t@p(say-be.closed) means ‘forbid, deprive’, as in 15.92–3. This verb is included in the term for
the ﬁrst pregnancy, associated with numerous taboos, wat@p-@-g@m (forbid-lk-ﬁrst.pregnancy),
literally, ‘the ﬁrst pregnancy of taboos’. The object of ‘forbid, deprive’ is in dative case—we can
recall from §7.4 that the dative case marks any undesirable non-subjects.

wuk@-mar- (think-neg?) ‘forget (not necessarily completely)’), as shown in 15.94. (Also see
§14.6: neither of these can be considered inherently negative lexemes.)

The third meaning of -t@p(@)- as V2 is ‘do ﬁrmly’. This meaning can be easily associated with
the lexical meaning of this verb—‘be closed, fence’ and so on. Examples are at 15.95–6. The
compound taka-t@p- in 15.95 is homophonous with taka-t@p- ‘prevent from seeing’, in 15.90.

The idiomatic expression sa:l yi-t@p(@)- (oath say/go-be.closed) means ‘swear a solemn
binding oath’. The degree of idiomaticity in -t@p(@)- compounds makes them diﬀerent from
grammaticalized compounds. Unlike -taka compounds, -t@p(@)- does not occur as V2 with the
general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’.
A9. ∗ -ba:gw- ‘do incessantly’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds expresses manner and extent
of action, as in yaku-ba:gw- ‘wash all over the place (e.g. sago)’, k@-ba:gw- ‘eat all over the place,
eat habitually’, væs@-ba:gw- ‘step all over the place’, vya-ba:gw- ‘hit all over the place’, g@ p@ba:gw- (run-do.incessantly) ‘run around’ in 15.97, and yi-ba:gw- ‘go incessantly’. A similar
example is in 18.33. The form -ba:gw- can undergo partial reduplication (see §12.8.2); the
resulting compound refers to multiple movements in every direction, e.g. g@ p@-bay-ba:gw@-d
(run-red?-do.incessantly-3masc.sgbas.vt/p) ‘he is running all over the place in every direction’.

A10. ∗ -pakw- ‘do all, affect all (S/O)’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds expresses extent
of action, participant involvement. This marker can occur with transitive and with intransitive
verbs, and it refers both to complete involvement of S/O and the complete degree of activity.

The form -pakw- frequently occurs with verbs to do with killing and dying. It could be
considered homonymous with pa:kw- ‘hide’ (see 15.54 and B2 in §15.3.2) (the long vowel is
expected to shorten in an unstressed position), but any such link is too far-fetched.
A11. ∗ -jika- ‘do properly’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds refers to proper achievement of
an action. There do not appear to be any restrictions on the semantics of V1 ; -jika does not
aﬀect the verb’s transitivity.
In her description of a now almost completely forgotten male initiation ritual, Sawsepali

A12. ∗ -yak@- ‘do fully; well and truly’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds refers to an
extreme extent of activity or state. This morpheme is homophonous with the verb yak@‘throw’. The semantic link, between ‘throw’ and ‘do fully; well and truly; very’ is tenuous.
In addition, any connection between the two was denied by most speakers.
There are no restrictions on the semantics of V1 combining with -yak@- as V2 ; and we will see
in §15.4 that -yak@- frequently attaches to a compound verb in V1 position. We saw in §4.3.2
that the adjective vyak@t ‘good’ is unusual in that it forms a compound with -yak@ ‘throw’
as a second component, as if it were a verb, e.g. vyak@ta-yak@ takwa-ñan (good-throw/fully
woman+lk-child) ‘very beautiful girl’. Other examples include 15.89 (‘cut the tree fully’),
15.101 (‘die fully’), 12.3 (‘close oﬀ completely’), 12.55 (‘die completely’), and 15.106.
In terms of its meaning, -yak@- refers to the complete extent of action, but may extend
to include complete involvement of any core participant—as in 12.55 where ‘everyone died
completely’ (the verb kiya- ‘die’ may mean ‘die’, or just ‘faint’, as in 15.122). In 15.106 -yak@
describes the fact that people went away for good, and that all of them did so.

given as an opposite of suku-pæsa-ta-d@ gabu-ma:j ‘half-written story’ in 15.37.
Unlike any other V2 , -yak@- has a distinct overtone of ‘do fully, be well and truly the case’,
as in 15.107, with an action verb ‘glue, mend’, and 15.108, with a stative verb ‘surpass; take
precedence’:

The suﬃx -tu- ‘complete involvement of S/O’ (§12.4) can occur together with -yak@-, e.g.
k@t@k@-tu-yak@-br@-di (cut-all-fully-3dusubj.p-3plbas.p) ‘they two well and truly cut them
all up’. A compound consisting of the verb wa ‘speak’ in V1 slot and -yak@- in the V2 slot has
a somewhat idiosyncratic meaning of ‘send, order’, as in 15.110.
15.110 [wun-a
ta:kw al@m kwa-l@-k]
[wa-yak@-gur-@k]
I-lk+fem.sg wife there stay-3fem.sg-compl.ds say-‘throw’-2pl-compl.ds
[ya-kwa]
come-impv.3p+fem.sg
‘After my wife stayed there, you sent her to come’ (lit. after you sent her, let her come)’
The second component of a wa-yak@- compound can occur twice, as in 15.111: the meaning
of the resulting form is ‘well and truly; intensively, strongly order (not to)’. The intensive
reading may have resulted from the meaning of reduplication (see §12.8.2). Or it may be
interpreted as an instance of an extra -yak@- ‘do fully’. The two interpretations are equally
plausible:

mother then she no say-‘throw’-red/fully+3fem.sgbas.p house+lk+all
war-war@k
go.up-red+dat
‘Mother, she strongly ordered (them) not to go up into the house’
The verb wa-yak@- typically implies a verbal order. Whether this is the same -yak@- as in
15.106–8 or a diﬀerent one, and how it may or may not be related to yak@- ‘throw’ is an open
question. We return to the use of wa-yak@- as a causative strategy in §16.2.2.","[391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396]"
"1949 Derivation and CompoundingAdjective-noun compounds often contain m@ya- ‘real’ whose exact meaning depends on the
second component of a compound: m@y-a-m@y-a-kayik (real-lk-real-lk-image/ghost) means
‘carving; picture (or any man-made image of a human or animal)’; m@y-a-na:gw (real-lksago) refers to cultivated sago; m@y-a-kamna:gw (real-lk-food) refers to protein foods and
also traditional foods considered ‘strong’, such as sago (see §21.2.4).
The noun wali used as a modiﬁer frequently occurs in compounds to refer to white people’s imports, e.g. wali-kamna:gw (white.person-food) ‘non-traditional food stuﬀ’, wali-yaki
(white.person-smoke) ‘store-bought tobacco’, wali-na:gw (white.person-sago) ‘biscuit’, wali-s@
‘Christian name’ (see above). This term is often extended to refer to any object acquired after
contact, e.g. wali-kami: (white.person-ﬁsh), to refer to a type of ﬁsh reportedly from Indonesian
waters which has been invading the waters of the Sepik for the last twenty-ﬁve years. Some of
these compounds develop very speciﬁc meanings, e.g. wali-kudi (white.person/east-language)
used to refer to any ‘white man’s language’, that is, both Tok Pisin and English, but now
mostly used to refer to Tok Pisin (Inglis kudi being the term for English). The compound
wali-n@b (white.person-dry.land) ‘dry-land-dweller of white person type; white person’ is a way
of referring to white people. (This has a morpheme-per-morpheme cognate in Iatmul (Gerd
Jendraschek, p.c.), and could have been calqued from Iatmul.)
The status of a compound as type 1 or type 2 may be indeterminate if the ﬁrst component
can be used as either a noun or an adjective. This is the case with compounds containing wali
‘white person; something to do with white person; eastern (wind); something coming from the
east’, and a few others, e.g. kaykwap-a ta:b (lazy-lk hand) ‘left hand’, literally, ‘lazy-hand or
hand of a lazy one’.
3. Coordinate compounds consist of two nouns typically without the linker referring to a
new referent which can be deﬁned by the two conjoined referents as its major representatives, e.g. du-ta:kw (man-woman) ‘people’, mæn-ta:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’, amæy-asa:y
(mother-father) ‘parents’, væy-ka:d (spear-shield) ‘arms’. If the ﬁrst component contains a
long vowel, it gets shortened, e.g. awa:y ‘mother’s brother’, away-mamæy (lit ‘maternal.unclemother.and.her.sisters’) ‘relatives responsible for bringing up a child’. The ﬁrst component of
some coordinate compounds can take the comitative marker, e.g. am-a-wa n@bi (bow-lk-com
arrow) (as in 7.71) or am-n@bi ‘bow and arrow’. Possibly, du-ta:kw (man-woman) ‘people’,
mæn-ta:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’ were inﬂuenced by Tok Pisin man-meri ‘people’ and lekhan ‘arms and legs’. (However, compounds of similar structure have been attested both in
related Ndu languages and in the neighbouring Kwoma and Yessan-Mayo.) The compound
kami-kamna:gw (ﬁsh-food) ‘foodstuﬀ’ has a generic noun as its second component.
4. Synonymous compounds are structurally and semantically similar to coordinate compounds. They consist of two near-synonyms, or nouns from the same semantic ﬁeld, both
with non-human referents. The compound describes either a group of linked referents, or
one referent with pronounced features of both components. The linker is obligatory, e.g.
kamkaw-a-ñan (hairy.yam-lk-smooth.white.yam) ‘yams as a group’; ar-a-ñab (lake-lk-river)
‘lake’; apwi-m@d (cassowary.vocative.term-cassowary) ‘mature female cassowary’; d@g-a-ta:m
(beak-lk-nose) ‘nose’.
5. Generic-specific compounds are somewhat similar to constructions with noun classiﬁers
in Australian and in Mayan languages. They consist of a noun ‘woman’ or ‘man’ followed
by a speciﬁc noun. With hybrid nouns, they serve to disambiguate the sex of a referent (see
§5.3), as in takwa-ñan (woman+lk-child) ‘girl’, du-a-ñan (man-lk-child) ‘boy’, gwa:s ‘turtle’,
du-a gwa:s ‘male turtle’, takwa gwa:s ‘female turtle’. They can also combine with some speciﬁc9.3 Compounding195nouns whose referents are inanimate, or non-human; then they indicate species, as in du-a-mæj
(man-lk-thread) ‘strong natural ﬁbre for making stringbags’ and du-a-kabay (man-lk-snake)
‘type of dangerous snake’. The term du-a-ma:gw (man-lk-generic.noun) ‘brother’ also belongs
to this type. These are similar to gender-identifying compounds containing nouns ‘man’
and ‘woman’ as their second component, as in babay-du ‘maternal grandfather’, babay-ta:kw
‘maternal grandmother’, yanan-ta:kw ‘daughter’s daughter’, yanan-du ‘daughter’s son’, and
bap-a-ta:kw (moon-lk-woman) ‘lady moon’ (note that moon is always feminine: see §5.2.1).
6. Order and size compounds contain asa:y ‘father’ and amæy ‘mother’ as their ﬁrst component. The term ‘father’ denotes large size, as in numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth)
‘very big tooth’, or asa:y wuk ‘huge tooth’, numa-d@ asa:y na:b ‘very long hair’ and so on (also
see §5.2.1 and 5.14). The term amæy refers to order in the compound amæy ta:kw (mother wife)
‘ﬁrst wife’, and perhaps also to prominence, as in amæy ta:b (mother hand) ‘thumb’. There is
no linker between the components.
7. Echo compounds involve nouns with non-human referents, and have the meaning of ‘things
of the same nature as the component which serves as base of echo alliteration’ (cf. Yip 1998:
237–8, for an outline of this phenomenon), e.g. ar-sar (lake-echo.reduplication) ‘lake and so
on; lake and waterways’; mij-ma:j (echo.reduplication-talk) ‘all kinds of small talk’. Echo
compounds of adverbs and one adjective have intensive meaning, e.g. kuprap ‘bad’, kuprap@saprap ‘really bad’, walba:b ‘near, close’, walba:b kalba:b ‘very close’ (or wal@b ‘close’, wal@b
kal@b ‘very close’), and sakw@r ‘happy’, makw@r sakw@r ‘very happy’, and so do noun-like
complements, such as wayg@r (with auxiliary) ‘complain’, wayg@r sayg@r ‘complain a lot’;
kayg@n ‘(be) silent’, kayg@n sayg@n ‘be really silent’. The only example of an inherently echo
compound is the noun-like complement saul@y paul@y ‘be in great numbers’, as in 9.37:
9.37 du-ta:kw
saul@y.paul@y
yi-di
man-woman in.great.numbers go-3plbas.vt
‘People were in great numbers’. 1
8. Compounds involving closed word classes include a Postposition-Noun combination
kuk@-m@l (at.back-eye) ‘(look) sideways’, and a Numeral-Noun combination viti-kisa-ñ@di
(two-?-child:du) ‘twins’.
9. Verb-noun compounds consist of a verb root plus a noun. The structure of the compounds
is similar to that of relative clauses (see §§19.2.2–3): the noun can be S, O, oblique, or A (the
latter is not so frequent), r @-tami: (sit-area) ‘area where one lives; living area’, kiya-du (die-man)
‘dead man’, bra-t@p (scrape-coconut) ‘coconut for scraping’, bla-ma:j (speak-speech) ‘talk’. A
compound can consist of a subject of a weather verb + the weather verb’s root + noun root, as
in [wa:l ja]-s@k@r (rain fall-time) ‘time of rainfall’.
This compounding type is extremely productive and is widely used to coin terms, such as
kusu-ja:p (wear-thing) ‘clothing’, gra-kudi (cry-language) ‘mourning, crying; term for mourning songs’, kiya-du ‘dead man; used as name of a Manambu football team in Avatip’. The term
s@kwa-mawul (carve-state.of.mind/inside) ‘state of mind of a carver’ was suggested by David
Takendu as a term meaning ‘patience’. The ﬁrst component of such compounds can consist of
1 Echo compounds are attested in other Ndu languages; the examples given by Wendel (1993: 92) from Hanga
Kundi (Wosera), involve verbs, unlike Manambu where verbs do not follow this pattern. Similar examples are given by
Staalsen and Staalsen (1975) in their dictionary of Iatmul, e.g. walanga salanga ‘relatives’. Gerd Jendraschek discovered
further echo compounds, e.g. wapuk sapuk ‘stories’ (pronounced as wapuchapuk). The number of echo compounds in
Manambu is too restricted to warrant any meaningful generalizations.","[220, 221, 222]"

‘Those men’s houses, those men’s houses which stay in that (topical) inland village, I will
enumerate them (topical) again’
In 10.54, a cross-referenced constituent referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative is
someone with respect to whom the action is performed. Examples of this sort indicate that the
reactivated topic demonstratives operate predominantly, but not exclusively, on an S/O basis.
Alternatively, they can be described as operating on a non-A basis. As illustrated in 10.68, a
clause can contain two occurrences of reactivated topic demonstratives, but never more than
that.
The reactivated topic demonstratives do not appear to form one NP with the noun they refer
to. They agree with this noun in gender and number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes
or be arguments of postpositions. There can be an intonation break between a demonstrative
and an NP it refers to (as in 10.68)—something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend
to occur immediately preceding the verb (or the complex adverb+verb, as in 10.68). If the
constituent they refer to has a contrastive overtone, they follow it, as in 10.62. We will see,
in §20.1.1, that Manambu is not averse to split NPs; however, they are never split between
clauses.
In terms of spatial reference, the demonstrative stems employed in reactivated topic demonstratives have similar overtones to the nominal spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1, under
A). In 10.69, the ‘close to addressee’ demonstrative is used to refer to the names of men’s houses
which were enumerated for my (addressee’s) beneﬁt (just as in 10.25 above).

‘I have already told the ones (names) of the away-from-the-Sepik River village, the

The last occurrence of aka (dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg) in aka kus@-na combines reference
to the O (‘story’) and to the action of telling itself: it supplies an aspectual overtone of ‘here
and now; ongoing action’ to a verb marked with action focus. Similar examples are under 10.56
and 10.78. We return to this in §12.1 and in §12.8.3 (C).
When reactivated topic demonstratives appear as predicate heads, they take the predicative marker -n followed by -a- and by gender-number agreement marker -@ka, e.g. k@ka-naka (dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘this feminine singular (reactivated
topic) is’, often used as a summary statement, ‘this is how it is, this is how things are’. Its
distal demonstrative counterpart is often used in a similar way, meaning ‘so, this is how
it is’:22210 Closed Classes10.70 aw [k@-l-@m

‘Then having come back here, this is how things are, we appeared (again) (to start
ﬁghting)’
In 10.71 (the end of Sepaywus’s recital of the names of men’s houses in Avatip), a plural
reactivated topic demonstrative heads the predicate. The gender and number agreement with
the subject is thus marked twice.

dem.dist.react.top+pl-pred-react.top.pl
‘The men’s houses belonging to that village inland are those ones (topical)’
To conclude: reactivated topic demonstratives agree with a cross-linguistic tendency for
preferred argument structure whereby a topical element is never introduced in the A function. They are typologically quite unusual in that they combine reference to the constituent’s
topicality, its grammatical relation, and its position in space. The latter makes them somewhat
redundant, given that they often occur in the same clause as nominal demonstratives with the
same spatial reference.10.3 i ndefinites
Manambu has two indeﬁnites, with the meaning ‘other, another’. The agreeing modiﬁer fem.sg.
n@k@, masc.sg. n@k@-d@, dual n@k@-b@r , plural n@k@-di ‘another, other’ (see §5.1.1) refers to
another, additional and diﬀerent, participant, e.g. n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) ‘next day,
another day’ and in 10.53 (’another story’). It can refer to ‘one’ and ‘another’ (members of a
pair), as in 10.55, or to several choices, as in 10.52. This example contains six occurrences of
n@k@ corresponding to the number of smoking grids in the spirit’s house. This pronoun can
also refer to an indeterminate location or time, or referent: n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) can
mean ‘next day, another day’ (then its synonym is kwap@k ‘next day’). Or it can mean ‘some
other day, whenever’. This same pronoun may refer to additional objects, e.g. ‘two more plates’
as in 10.72.
10.72 n@k@-b@r plet viti akray!
other-du plate two impv+bring
‘Bring two more plates!’ (lit. two other plates)
The pronoun ‘other, another’ carries with it a distinct overtone of something undesirable
and potentially dangerous. In 10.3 above, ‘another man’, or a ‘stranger’ is a trespasser. A
similar example is 8.12 (the gist of it is that other people’s cats are strangers and do nothing
but damage).
The feminine locative form of the indefinite n@k@- ‘other, another’, n@k@m, means ‘halfheartedly; not fully’:10.3 Indeﬁnites22310.73 gura:m

This form can be repeated as n@k@m n@k@m (another.fem.sg+loc another.fem.sg+loc) ‘bit of
everything; in a random way’. In 10.74 it is used as modiﬁer to the noun, and in 10.75 as a
manner modiﬁer to the verb. In 21.44, repetition of n@k@m means ‘wherever’.

The pronoun n@k@- is usually employed as a prehead modiﬁer; only occasionally can its
head be omitted. In contrast, the indeﬁnite n@w@k ‘(an)other one’ is used only as a head. It can
be modiﬁed with nominal demonstratives, but, unlike any other nominal, does not take case
marking. It can have a singular referent, as in 10.76. It is in O function, but is not marked for
case.

n@w@k refers to ‘others among us’: the personal reference is obvious from the marking on the
verb.

n@k@- and n@w@k. The meaning of ‘someone; one . . . another’ can be achieved by using the
numeral ‘one’ (see §10.6). Repetition of a noun has a distributive indeﬁnite meaning, e.g. ag@k
‘one of the two sides’, ag@k ag@k ‘one side to the other’, tab@k ‘end of, side’, tab@k t@b@k ‘one
side and another’.10.4 i n t e r ro gat i v e s
Content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation, while
polar questions are marked by intonation only. Interrogative clauses are discussed in §20.1.3.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause; like any constituent, if it is in
contrastive focus it tends to occupy the clause-initial position and acquire focus marking.
Interrogatives form a heterogeneous class in terms of their meanings, syntactic function,
focus marking, and grammatical categories. Interrogatives include nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
and quantiﬁers. There are no interrogative verbs. Manambu employs the following interrogative stems:
(i) s@- ‘who; whose’;
(ii) agwa- ‘what, which’;
(iii) ak@- ‘where; belonging to where; when’;
(iv) akr@l ‘where to’;
(v) agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’;
(vi) ata, ata ata, at@ta, atawa, at@tawa, at@taka, k@t@taka ‘how’; and
(vii) kas ‘how many/much; which (by number)’.
(i) The pronoun s@ ‘who’ has human reference, and can be used as an argument, as head of
predicate, and as a possessive modiﬁer (‘whose’). It takes all cases, except for transportatives
and substitutive. Unlike nouns, it cannot take any modiﬁer. As shown in §7.1, this form behaves
similarly to third person non-plural personal pronouns in that it takes a linker -k@-, as shown
in 10.79 (see §7.9 on the form of the comitative with ‘who’).

Unlike a personal pronoun, it cannot be reduplicated. A constituent in a medial completive
clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is one of the properties of these clauses
which diﬀerentiates them from other types, especially relative and conditional clauses (see
Chapter 19). The interrogative ‘who’ in 10.80 is in dative case, required by the verb ‘ask’ (lit.

and number with the possessee, as in 10.81.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"
