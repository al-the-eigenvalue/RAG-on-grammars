"8.1.6 Word order and pragmatic status
As can be concluded from Tables 45, 48 and 49 above, the order of predicates and
their arguments in Yurakaré is fairly flexible. This is directly connected to the fact
that all grammatical relations are marked either on the verb or by postpositions on
the dependent noun phrase. This flexibility of word order makes it rather difficult
to come up with a basic word order.
Nevertheless, overtly expressed subjects (both S and A 8) seem to have a clear
preference for the postverbal position. Occurrences of preverbal subjects can often
be explained in terms of special pragmatic status, whereas overtly expressed
pragmatically neutral subjects are generally found in postverbal position.
Preverbal subjects are almost invariably emphatic topics, though not every
marked topic ends up before the verb. Givón (2001b:253‐269) mentions a number
of cross‐linguistically found marked topics and discusses the morphosyntax
associated with these. What Givón calls ‘existential‐presentative constructions’,
I take A here to mean subjects of all two‐ and three‐place predicates, including extended
intransitives and extended transitives.",[293]

‘He was the one who cut him with a stone and with wax and an ax!’ (OR‐19MA‐9)This text fragment, consisting of sequential utterances, is taken from a narrative in
which the speaker mixes up the main characters of the story and then finds out
about her mistake. She then continues to set things straight by explicitly stating
the roles that the main characters have. The subjects of (22)d‐f are pre‐verbal and
in contrastive focus.
In general, then, we can say that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order;
preposing a subject gives some kind of emphasis to it. The fact that the pre‐verbal
position is pragmatically marked is corroborated by the fact that question words
are always sentence‐initial, regardless of their semantic or syntactic role (more
discussion on questions in the next section):

postverbal position can be given in terms of frequency. Preverbal and postverbal
objects (O as well as E) occur in about equal proportions.
Typological research in the past decades has revealed some rather strong
correlations between sentence word order and the order of words in other
constructions. In Table 50 I give Greenberg’s (1963) list, taken from Payne
(1997:72):281A grammar of YurakaréTable 50 - Word order correlations in Greenberg 1963, taken from Payne 1997:72

Nevertheless, these correlations are not very convincing and can never be
evidence in themselves for a basic order.
Generally, preverbal objects are pragmatically marked as well:

‘All of that our chief Tiri transformed before.’ (both: OR‐19MA‐20)In (24), the narrator is telling about the mythological ancestor of the Yurakaré, Tiri,
who used his magic to transform into jungle animals all kinds of objects and
creatures that he encountered during his wandering, so that the Yurakaré would
have meat. In the second line, the object ati amumuy is preposed, because it is a
marked topic, with a deictic function, referring back to the topic of the previous
sentence.
In the following fragment, the object is emphasized (stressed) and fronted in the
final sentence of the example:282The clause(25) F

‘Let’s make her chuchio, ehh jisopo and burn it first.’ (FL&DV‐14MA‐1)Generally, it seems that marked objects are found in initial position. Postverbal
objects can also refer to new and unpredictable information, but objects with extra
emphasis (focus), whether direct or applied, are found in preverbal position. The
fact that applied objects have a slight preference for being postverbal can be
explained by the fact that they are usually very topical (cf. Van Gijn 2005).
The emphatic function of the preverbal position can also be seen in examples
such as the following, where the object NP is discontinuous (cf. section 4.1), the
modifier being in preverbal position, while the head noun is in postverbal
position:
(26) lëshie=w ma‐bëjta‐y
shunñe=w
two=PL
3PL‐see‐1SG.S man=PL
‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]This construction gives emphasis to the quantifier, while the head noun is
presented as a specification, or afterthought, possibly but not necessarily after a
pause. The quantifier is also stressed.
Not very often both object and subject are overtly expressed. In the instances
where this was the case, I have encountered four word orders in texts:283A grammar of Yurakaré(27) abcdtostosma‐che‐ø=ya na

‘Aysa was looking for sabalo.’ (OR‐19MA‐11)I have found no instances of SOV or OSV. The reason that these are rare seems to
be connected to the tendency in the Yurakaré main clause for the verb to be
preceded by only one constituent. In analyzing the first 85 clauses of a text, I have
encountered only three instances where the verb was not in second or first place in
the clause. All kinds of constituents can precede the verb. In (27)a two ideophonic
particles precede the verb; in (27)b and c, two elements precede the verb. Consider
(28), where some other elements that can precede the verb are given:

‘They were standing there red (ripe).’ (AY‐3NC‐7)In almost all of the sentences that I examined in two texts, the verb was in either
initial or second position, preceded by all kinds of elements. In some instances, the
verb is in third place. This is also the case in the examples in (27)b and c. In these
circumstances, the first element is always a kind of setting marker, like latijsha
‘then’ pënchi ‘later’ ati ‘there’. These are elements that have a scope which is on the
level of the proposition. Subordinated clauses are also often in this position, often,
like setting words (adverbial elements setting the stage for a main event), marked
by an intonation break:

different internal word‐order, generally. Overtly expressed arguments mostly
precede the predicate in these types of clauses:

appear to the right of the subordinating enclitic =ja (or =ti):

agouti grandmother
‘Then Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)Leaving aside subordinated clauses, the data suggest that Yurakaré main clause
structure is V‐initial, with two positions before the verb, one position for setting
words, followed by an emphasis position, then followed by the verb. If we look at
how the elements after the verb are ordered, there is not a clear pattern, but
generally the most topical, known information is found rightmost. Adverbs and
adjuncts can intervene; adverbs related to the event are generally adjacent to the
verb, either to the left or to the right (cf. section 6.5.9 above). The following is a
continuous text fragment from the beginning of a text:285A grammar of Yurakaré(33) abcdetütü‐ø=ya

‘He carried with him a very small basket, this Pëpësu.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Clause (33)a of the fragment is an existential‐presentative construction. The
subject, as expected, is in postverbal position. The adverb shinama generally
appears right after the verb. In (33)b the main new information in the form of an
adjunct is postverbal. The same adjunct in (33)c is the final element and old
information. The new information is the combination pëpëshamaw lacha, which
comes before the old information. In (33)d, the subordinate clause is preposed,
followed by a setting‐word latijsha and a preverbal subject with an extra emphasis
marker =ja introduces a new topic. In (33)e, finally, the emphasized element
anajalima is taken out of the object NP and positioned in the preverbal position.
The new object awerta comes right after the predicate, while the old information na
pëpësu is the final element. The template of the main clause, then, roughly looks as
in (34). Note that these are not absolute positions, but rather tendencies in the
clause.
(34) (setting), emphasis, VP (pred. + adverbs), new information, topic, afterthought8.1.7 Negative and interrogative clauses
Negative clauses are marked by the negative adverb nish, with phonetic variant nij
(to negate a predicate or VP) or by the form nij‐ta (NEG‐MID; existential negation).
Nish/nij normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates:Aysa and Pëpësu are two characters that are closely connected in this story in which they
work together. The reason the narrator started the story with Aysa is probably because I
asked him to tell the story of Aysa.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]"
"1267A grammar of YurakaréPredicates with a valence of one can be divided into intransitive verbs and non‐
verbal predicates. These two categories are not formally distinct. Still, I consider
them to be separate categories, since with regard to non‐verbal predications, it is
often difficult to say what is the word order exactly, VS or SV. This is because it is
not always clear which of the two elements is the predicate and which the
argument, hence the high percentage of unanalyzable non‐verbal predicates in
Table 45. As Payne (1997:83) says: “(…) the probability of mistakenly including
predicate nominals in a study of constituent order is quite high (especially if the
language uses a zero copula element in predicate nominals).” Predicates with a
valency of two can be divided into inherently transitive and derived transitive
predicates, or extended intransitives. It is useful to distinguish these two, since, as
will become apparent below, they behave differently in some respects.
In the remainder of this section I will discuss the types of predicates mentioned
in Table 45: intransitive verbs (8.1.1), transitive verbs (8.1.3), extended intransitive
verbs (8.1.4), ditransitive verbs (8.1.5), and non‐verbal predicates (8.1.2). In 8.1.6, I
will discuss word order from an overall perspective; in 8.1.7, finally I will briefly
discuss interrogative and negative sentences.","[282, 283]"
"The ClauseThis chapter deals with clauses. Clauses in Yurakaré consist minimally of a
predicate, and optionally of overtly expressed arguments, and/or adverbs and
particles. First I will discuss simple clauses (8.1), then I will go on to discuss
complex constructions (8.2), such as complementation, relative clauses, adverbial
clauses and coordination.
8.1 The simple clause
In (1), there are three participants on stage, the addressee (subject), the wound (it),
and the beneficiary (her). None of these three participants is expressed overtly:
(1)tishi
ka‐n‐tëptë‐cha‐m
konsono
now 3SG‐IO‐wash‐JUS‐2SG.S
well
‘Now wash it [wound] well for her.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)In fact, text analyses show that objects and subjects are overtly expressed in only
25.6% (objects 1) and 28.1% (subjects) of all clauses. Table 45 below shows how
different types of predicates behave in terms of the (non‐)expression of arguments.
It also shows the word order of predicates and arguments when the latter are
overtly expressed. I looked at five texts: three mythological narratives, one
explanatory text and one conversation. I counted the number of instances where
the subject was not expressed (Vs), and the subject was overtly expressed;
furthermore, I counted the number of instances where it was expressed after the
verb (VS) and before the verb (VS). I did the same for objects.

0As far as valency is concerned, there are three basic types of predicates in
Yurakaré: one‐place predicates, two‐place predicates and three‐place predicates.
In Table 45, however, I distinguish five types of predicates rather than three.
In this case I count both direct objects and applied objects. They will be considered
separately below.",[282]
"We have already seen the ordering of applicative prefixes and cross‐referencing
prefixes in (5). As an illustration of the suffixal order, consider the following
utterance:
(7)mëë
mala‐m=ti
chili‐ta‐shta‐ø

go.SG‐2SG.S=DS clean‐MID‐FUT‐2SG.S
2SG‐foot:LOC 2SG‐mark
‘If you go, the mark on your foot will rub off.’ (OR‐19MA‐31)Here we can see that the middle voice marker precedes the future marker in the
verb chilitashta.
The distinction between inflection and derivation is relevant in that it explains
many of the ordering of morphemes. Derivational elements are generally closer to
the root than inflectional elements, a tendency observed to be generally true for
most languages (cf. Bybee 1985). The verbal template is characterized by the
following linear order of morphemes:
(8)inflection‐derivation‐root‐derivation‐inflectionThe more clearly derivational a morpheme, the closer it is to the root, generally.
Inflectional order is TMA suffixes before cross‐referencing suffixes.
There is also a system of verbal enclitics, which mainly have a modal (epistemic)
or aspectual meaning, and in addition a small set of clausal enclitics, which can
attach to any phrase‐final word. These clause‐final elements often have to do with
emphasis and speaker commitment.",[26]

DEM‐LIM=EMPHAdjectives can either precede or follow the head noun. There seems to be no semantic
distinction connected to the different orders. The normal case, however, is that
adjectives are used as predicates, a point also observed by Day (1980). It is often hard
to decide whether a semantically modifying element is used as a predicate or a
dependent adjective, since there is partial overlap in morphology (cf. section 3.3).
Nevertheless, examples like (4) show that within the NP, there are two possible
positions for the adjective.
(4)shuyulë
yee=w
~
beautiful woman=PL
‘beautiful women’yeeshuyulë=wPlurality is generally marked once for every NP. The number clitic appears on the final
element of the NP. The fact that the adjective and the noun ‘share’ a number marker (a
phrasal enclitic) suggests that they are within one and the same NP. Nevertheless, the
number enclitic is not exemplary for a phrasal enclitic, since it is often expressed on the
noun as well as the adjective, especially with the order NA. I will come back to this
point below (4.2).
Another set of enclitics are the postpositions marking the relationship of the NP to its
head. These postpositions follow the position of the plural enclitic. There is only one
slot for postpositions; there are no instances of a combination of two or more
postpositions on one NP. An example of such a postposition is the comitative marker is
given in (5):
(5)… a‐bonto=w=tina
3SG.P‐son=PL=COM
‘…with his sons’ (AR‐8MI‐64)As far as relation‐marking strategies are concerned, dependent‐marking strategies
compete with head‐marking strategies where the relationship between the verb and its
dependent NPs is encoded on the verb. This has to do with topicality and animacy.
Animate topical participants are more likely cross referenced on the verb, e.g. by
means of applicative constructions, non‐topical, inanimate participants are more likely
to be marked by means of a postposition (cf. Van Gijn 2005) 2. Postpositions will be
discussed in 4.3; head marking of grammatical relations will be the topic of sections 5.1
and 5.22Some relations, such as subject and direct object, are always marked on the verb.","[106, 107]"
"3.2.2 Suffixing, prefixing, and infixing
As mentioned, Yurakaré has both prefixes and suffixes. The categories associated
with prefixes and suffixes are roughly as follows:
Table 12 ‐ categories of prefixes and objects
prefixessuffixesobject cross‐reference
object‐oriented valency
aspect
derivationsubject cross‐reference
subject‐oriented valency
tense, mood, aspect
derivationThe order of bound morphemes is fixed in Yurakaré, corresponding to their scope,
as well as to the distinction between derivation and inflection. By derivational
morphemes I mean morphemes that “form new words either by changing the
meaning of the base to which they are attached (…) or by changing the word‐class
that a base belongs to” (Katamba 1993:47). “Inflectional morphemes are only able
to modify the form of a word so that it can fit in a particular syntactic slot”
(Katamba 1993:51).
In the following examples, we can see that inflection is generally found more
towards the edge of a word, while derivation is closer to the root. Consider first:51A grammar of Yurakaré(14) aana‐kka‐ø=tika‐l‐i‐sibë‐ø
3SG‐AFO‐VBL‐house‐3
‘When he was this big, she made him a house.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
tütü‐mashi‐ø=w=ya
sit‐LD‐3=PL=NVR
‘They stayed a little.’ (AR‐8MI‐60)DEM‐MEA‐3=DSbIn (14)a, there are several derivational affixes. On the demonstrative pronoun ana,
there is a derivational element deriving a measure ‘this size’. This derivation also
changes the word class, turning it into an adjectival element, used as a predicate
here. The derivational element is followed by a zero morpheme. I will argue for
the existence of this zero morpheme in section 3.2.5 below. In the same section, I
will discuss enclitics, of which =ti is an example. The second (main) predicate in
(14)a has its cross‐referencing object morpheme ka‐ leftmost, more towards the
verb root, we find the derivational elements l‐ (shortened form of la‐) ‘affected
object’‐applicative and i‐ ‘verbalizer’. The prefix la‐ (or l‐ before a vowel) is an
applicative prefix which increases the valence of a verb, which, in this case, has the
role of beneficiary. The prefix i‐ is a category‐changing prefix, deriving verbs from
nouns. In (14)b, the verb root is followed by a derivational element ‐mashi, which
indicates that the event is carried out to a limited degree (a little), followed by the
subject marker ‐ø and the plural morpheme =w.
As far as tense, mood and aspect are concerned, the order seems to follow the
relevance principle (Bybee 1985), which says that an affix is placed closer to the
root the more relevant it is to the meaning of the root from a cognitive point of
view.
The only tense marker ‐shta ‘future tense’ is found before the subject markers, as
is event‐related modality and aspect 5. Modality and aspect that is more
propositional related (epistemic) or related to expressive and interactional motives
of the speaker are external to the person markers (cf. sections 7.1 and 7.2)
Infixing is a marginal process in Yurakaré. A first possible example of this is a
variant of the imperative singular (cf. section 6.3.5) marker <‐n‐> (with allomorph
[m]) with verbs that start with the vowel /i/. Examples of infixing of this type often
involve roots that seem to be complex in one way or another; hence we may not be
dealing with infixing after all:The only prefixed aspectual markers a‐ ‘incompletive and i‐ ‘verbal plural’ either replace
object prefixes (in the case of incompletive a‐) or they merge with the object markers (in the
case of verbal plural i‐).","[66, 67]"
"4.2 Number
Number in Yurakaré has two basic values: singular and plural. Singular is unmarked,
while plural is normally marked by the enclitic =w, which minimally appears on the
last element of the NP:Discontinuous NPs are a frequently observed feature in languages with a flexible word order
(Givón 2001‐II:13).
4 I consider this construction to be an applicative construction with a comitative object, cf.
section 5.2.1.

‘I have two brothers.’ [MH‐8MA‐3]It is not clear how (9) should be analyzed. We may be dealing with a simple noun
phrase with clitic copying, but we could also analyze either one of the words in (9) as
verbs, since the ending =w is also found on verbs as the marker for 3rd person plural
subject, and non‐verbs can be used as predicates without any overt derivational
marking (cf. section 3.3.3).

‘The two (things) are my brothers.’
‘There are two, they are brothers’Example (9) could have all the interpretations of (10) 5. We cannot say with certainty
whether the construction in (9) represents clitic doubling or not. However, since the
final element is the minimally marked element, I consider the marker =w to be an
enclitic.
Not all noun phrases can be marked for plural:
(11) lëshie sibbë(*=w)
two
house(*=PL)
‘two houses’It is not clear, however, what determines which nouns can be marked for plural.
Typological literature suggests that animacy frequently interacts with number marking
(cf. Corbett 2000: 55‐66). Cross‐linguistically, elements that are higher on the animacy
hierarchy (Figure 1) are more likely to mark the opposition between singular and
plural than elements lower on the scale.","[108, 109]"
"1062Morphologyprefixes, which trigger the loss of the geminate consonant in the root, whereas the
proclitics do not:
(45) an yarru
ti‐yaru‘this chicha’
‘my chicha’There is also a distributional argument to distinguish clitics from independent
words: the positional possibilities of clitics are generally more restricted than those
of independent words. For instance, if we look at the different possibilities in the
internal word order of the noun phrase consisting of the three elements matata
‘big’, yee ‘woman’, and ja ‘emphatic subject’ we can see the distinction between
words and clitics:
(46) a
b
cmatata yee=ja
yee matata=ja
*ja matata yee‘big woman’The morphemes matata and yee can both appear as the first element of the noun
phrase, but the element ja cannot. In fact, this element attaches to the final element
of the noun phrase. The order yee=ja matata or matata=ja yee is allowed, but this can
be explained by the fact that nouns and adjectives can function as predicates and
adjectives can function as heads of noun phrases as well (cf. section 3.3). The
analysis of these two noun phrases would be:
(47) a
b[yee]NP=ja
[matata]PRED
[matata]NP=ja [yee]PREDFinally, many clitics are monosyllabic or even non‐syllabic, while there is
independent phonological evidence that independent words are required to
minimally have two syllables (cf. section 2.4.6).
Clitics can be distinguished from affixes on the basis of one or more of the
following criteria. First, some of the clitics have more combinatory possibilities
than affixes with regard to the host they attach to. For instance, the plural enclitic
=w can attach to either nouns or adjectives, while the collective marker ‐ima can
only attach to adjectives and the possessive prefixes attach to nouns only. Second,
affixes generally cannot attach to clitics, whereas clitics can (cf. Zwicky & Pullum
1983:504). Finally, affixes are always taken into account with regard to stress
placement; in Yurakaré, most clitics are as well, but some clitics are not.
Clitics in Yurakaré can be classified with respect to each other as well. There are
three classes of clitics which can be distinguished on the basis of the following
criteria.","[77, 78]"
"11A grammar of YurakaréWord order is relatively free. Overtly expressed subjects most frequently appear
in postverbal position; objects occur on both sides of the verb with about equal
frequency. Adverbs are relatively free in their position; different adverbs have
different preferences.
Complex clauses are often marked by one of three clause‐chaining enclitics
marking that the subject expressed in the verb they attach to is either the same or
different from the subject of the last verb in the string of predicates. There are two
enclitics indicating ‘same subject’, depending on the factual status of the
subordinated predicate: =ya for irrealis, =ja for realis.","[26, 27]"
"44PhonologyOther examples are to ‘bone’, ye ‘woman, sister’, pü ‘road’. I consider these nouns
to be underlyingly monosyllabic; in order to avoid a stressed final syllable, the
final vowel is copied. The double vowels are optionally separated by a glottal
stop. In example (73)b, the vowel is still copied, even though the prefixation of ti‐
makes the underlying word disyllabic. This is because the prefix ti‐, as explained
above, is stress‐avoiding. The available vowel copying is used for this purpose.
However, there are at least two monosyllabic nouns that do not allow this vowel
copying. These nouns never occur in citation form, they are always possessed:
(74) tí‐nñu
tí‐bba‘my suckling’
‘my husband’As can be seen, the normally unstressed first person singular possessive is stressed
here. Apparently, with these roots, the constraint that prohibits stress‐avoiding
syllables to be stressed is violated rather than adding a vowel. Apart from
stressing this light prefix there is a geminated consonant in both words, just like
the roots with a stress‐avoiding syllable in them: in order to license stress on the
light syllable, it is made heavy by geminating the following consonant.","[59, 60]"
"4.1 Introduction
In this section I will make some general remarks on the structure and composition of
the NP in Yurakaré, with special reference to the order of words within the NP.
The template of the Noun Phrase in Yurakaré is as follows 1:
QN(1)[DEMAPOSSN(POSS)A ] =PL=POSTP(REL CLAUSE)NUMNoun phrases are headed by a noun, the element that determines the syntactic function
of the whole phrase (cf. Payne 1997:31). Nouns can be modified by adjectives,
quantifiers, numerals, possessor phrases or adjectivally used demonstratives.
Demonstratives, quantifiers and numerals always precede the noun they modify. All
three can be used independently as well, forming an elliptic NP of their own. Numerals
and quantifiers are mutually exclusive in one and the same NP for semantic reasons.
Demonstratives and quantifiers do co‐occur:
(2)atilëtta
yee
DEM
one
woman
‘this one woman’ (AR‐8MI‐3)Possessors are cross‐referenced on the possessed noun. Since they are cross‐referenced,
the overt expression of the possessor NP is not obligatory. When expressed, possessors
in the vast majority of cases precede the possessed noun. It is not prohibited however,
for the possessor to follow the possessed noun:I am leaving relative clauses out of the discussion in this chapter; they will be treated below in
section 8.2.",[106]
"Verbal agreement, voice and valencyGrammatical relations in Yurakaré are mainly marked through verbal cross‐
referencing. Word order does not play a role in identifying grammatical relations, and
dependent marking (postpositions ‐ cf. section 4.3) is used mainly to mark peripheral
participants. Subjects and objects are marked on the verb; subjects are suffixes and
objects are prefixes. In addition to this, Yurakaré has an elaborate system of
applicatives, as well as a middle marker and a causative construction to modify the
valency of a verb. In this chapter I will discuss transitivity, valency and the encoding of
subjects and direct objects on the verb (5.1), applicatives (5.2), and voice (5.3).
5.1 Person marking, valency and transitivity
Dixon & Aikhenvald (2000:3) make a distinction between valency and transitivity:
“There are two main transitivity types ‐ intransitive (with core argument S) and
intransitive (with A and O) ‐ and plain and extended subtypes of each (depending on
whether or not E [extension to core ‐ RvG] is also in the core”. Schematically, this can
be represented as follows:
(a) intransitive
(b) extended intransitive
(c) transitive
(d) extended transitiveS
S
A
AE
O
OEValency, in this view, relates to the number of core arguments, i.e. one in (a), two in (b),
two in (c) and three in (d). I will follow Dixon & Aikhenvald in making the distinction
between valency and transitivity, since it is a useful one for describing the Yurakaré
system.
In Yurakaré, the distinction between valency and transitivity is directly reflected in
the formal behavior of the verb. Subjects and direct objects are obligatorily cross‐
referenced on the verb; intransitive verbs do not have object markers, whereas
transitive verbs do. Any extension of transitivity is formally marked, e.g. by means of
applicative or causative markers, even if the extended argument belongs to the
semantic argument structure of a verb.
As mentioned, the two basic arguments, subject and direct object are both cross‐
referenced on the verb, subjects are cross‐referenced by suffixes, objects by prefixes.
The paradigms look as follows:143A grammar of YurakaréTable 30 ‐ Person marking paradigms

a gender distinction 1. As for the two zero elements in the paradigm, I do not consider
the zero element in the object paradigm to be actually present; it is simply a gap in the
paradigm triggering a default interpretation of third person singular, the typical
interpretation for a zero element cross‐linguistically (Siewierska 2004: 24). The zero
element in the third person singular and plural subject is a different matter. The
nominal plural marker is =w (cf. section 4.2). I assume that this plural enclitic needs a
nominal element to have scope over. Viewing the subject paradigm as such
furthermore has the advantage that it shows that the bound subject affixes follow the
same pattern as the free pronouns:
Table 31 ‐ Comparison of free pronouns and subject markers

‐ø=wJudging from the forms of some of the markers in comparison to the free pronouns
(e.g. mëë vs. ‐m, tuwa vs. ‐tu, paa vs. ‐p) the subject paradigm and the free pronouns are
related. The free pronoun paradigm, which consists of four personal pronouns – for
third person reference demonstrative pronouns are used – shows suppletive forms for
singular and plural first and second person pronouns, whereas the demonstratives
referring to third persons are marked for plural in a regular way, by means of the
enclitic =w. This same distinction between first and second persons on the one hand
and third on the other is observed in the subject marking paradigm.","[158, 159]"
"4.4.1 Possession
Attributive possession is marked on nouns only. It involves a relation between two
nouns. A person prefix is added to the head noun; the dependent noun is not marked.
The possessive prefixes constitute a paradigm which shows some formal similarities115A grammar of Yurakaréwith the free pronouns as well as the object markers. There is no straightforward
synchronic derivational relationship, however:

3plThe sound /t/ in the first person possessive marker can be explained by the fact that the
free pronoun sëë is pronounced [tsQQ], with a slight [t] in the onset. The third person
singular and the plural are not transparently related. As for the prefix a‐ for third
person singular possessive, we can say that the vowel /a/ is present throughout the
demonstrative paradigm, and may have a deictic meaning. The prefix ma‐ may be
related to the word mumuy or mumay, which means ‘all’. The possession paradigm is
also identical to the object paradigm formally, the third person singular being the
exception.
The possessive prefix is obligatory 18, there are one or two instances where the
possessor prefix is absent, but these can be considered exceptions. The possessor is
often lexically expressed, but this is not obligatory. When expressed, the possessor can
occur either before or after the head noun; the order possessor‐possessed is most often
encountered, however:

maoshewow ‘their pots’). Possessed nouns can be modified by e.g. adjectives and
numerals:18With the exception of compounded possessive relations.","[130, 131]"

‘His arrow did not catch fire, subsequently.’ (AY‐2NC‐5)In these examples the clitic na is not used adjectivally, but rather independently,
except for the second occurrence of na in (49)b. In (49)b and c the corresponding
noun phrase follows later, in (49)a, there is no corresponding noun phrase. Note
too, that the clitic form of the demonstrative cannot be marked for plural, as can
be observed in (49)a and c. Furthermore, in (49)c, the clitic seems to attach to the
preceding word instead of the following word. In this specific example, na is
followed by a small pause. These facts make it hard to classify these clitics as
proclitics or enclitics. The clitics an and a(t) are more restricted. They usually only64Morphologyappear in adjectival position, and do not alternate with free forms in other
positions.
Another group of reduced, unstressed clitics are reduced forms of the adverb
latijsha ‘then, after that, when’, which functions as a connector. The forms are lash
and la.

themselves unstressed. They seem to be restricted to clause initial position, but the
full form latijsha (which is sometimes also reduced to lashsha, a reduced form that
still carries stress) also mainly occurs in clause‐initial position.
Some other adverbs also have reduced forms, such as achu ‘like that’ (ash) and

2SG‐markA grammar of YurakaréAs can be seen in the examples, it does not matter whether these reduced
pronouns precede ((52)b and d) or follow ((52)a and c) the predicate or noun they
are cross‐referenced with.
In the examples of the remainder of the grammar, I will not indicate the
proclitics discussed in examples (48)‐(52) by means of the symbol ‘=’. I will in fact
not distinguish these enclitics from separate words in their representation, since
they do not seem to constitute one word with their host as much as the other
clitics do, as we will see. First, they do not form a phonological word with their
host as far as prosody is concerned; second, they seem to be more free positionally
than class II and class III clitics. Class I enclitics differ furthermore from class II
and III clitics in Yurakaré in that whereas the former generally have unreduced
and independent counterparts, the latter two do not.
Before discussing class II clitics, I will first discuss class III clitics. Class III clitics
can be termed phrasal enclitics because they attach to a phrase‐final element. In
the nominal domain, the plural marker and the postpositional markers are
examples of phrasal enclitics:
(53) abmatata ti‐pojore=w
big

‘my big canoes’
inele
elle=y

earth=LOC
‘in the ground’vs.vs.ti‐pojore
matata=w
1SG‐canoe
big=PL
‘my big canoes’
elle
inele=y
earth inside=LOC
‘in the ground’The order of adjectives and nouns can be reversed, as can be seen in (53).
Nevertheless, the plural marker in (53)a as well as the postposition in (53)b remain
where they are: they attach to the rightmost element of the NP. Other nominal
enclitics are =chi ‘directional’, =jsha ‘ablative’, =la ‘instrumental’, =tina ‘comitative’
and =ja ‘subject emphasis marker’. I will discuss all of these in sections 4.2 and 4.3
below.
NPs can be discontinuous in Yurakaré (cf. section 4.1). The head of the NP in
these circumstances is postverbal, while its modifier is in preverbal, focus position.
In these cases, the postpositions are still attached to the (rightmost) head noun,
while the preposed modifier does not have any postpositional marking:
(54) abdanda‐shti
kummë matata=la
go.up‐FUT.1SG.S tree

‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
matata danda‐shti
kummë=la
big
go.up‐FUT.1SG.S
tree=INS
‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]66MorphologyPlural markers behave a little differently. When a plural NP is discontinuous,
usually both the modifier and the head noun are marked for plural:
(55) lëshie=w ma‐bëjti
shunñe=w
two=PL 3PL‐see:1SG.S man=PL
‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]Plural markers are generally found more often on both the head noun and the
modifier, even if the NP is not discontinuous, and especially with the order noun‐
adjective. Postpositional enclitics are never found on both elements.
There are also a few clausal clitics that mostly attach to the clause‐final element.
These are modal and aspectual particles. Examples are =la ‘validational’, =bë
‘momentaneous’, =se ‘repetition (among other meanings)’ and =bëla (continuative).

subject. The enclitic =bëla in (56)d, finally, is attached to the subject. These enclitics
can also attach to other parts of speech:

adverb. In other words: these syntactic enclitics can attach to different hosts when
they are the last element of the clause. Occasionally, an element that pertains to
the clause comes after the clausal enclitic:

mujumuju carries the locative postposition =y, which in turn is followed by the
compounded noun bëshë ‘thing, entity’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"

scepticism, strong doubt or even disagreement. In (74)a, the speakers (who are
jaguars) see a number of dead birds lying around, and they cannot believe that
their mother has killed them by herself. They strongly suspect that she did not kill
the human child they gave to her in order for her to kill and eat it. In (74)b, the
speaker gets the message that the family he lives with is not his family after all, a
statement he disagrees with.
=jtë ‘speculative’ + =ya ‘non‐veridical’

7.1.1 and 8.2.2) and interestingly, the speculative marker is still on the repeated
verb, and comes before the non‐veridical marker. Normally, the repeated verb
would be devoid of any TMA marker and person marking. In this case, there is no
person marker on the repeated verb, but the speculative marker is still there.
These are the combinations of epistemic modality that I have found. I did not
encounter combinations of the enclitics =bala ‘admonitive’ and =tiba ‘assumptive’
with other epistemic enclitics. Once again, it must be stressed that this does not
entail that combinations of this kind are impossible.
With the above examples of combinatory possibilities we can come up with the
following tentative template:jtë

accounts for morpheme orders (cf. Muysken 1986), but it is a good start for the
study of morpheme order and interpretation.","[276, 277, 278]"
"9A grammar of YurakaréThe noun phrase normally consists of a noun and optionally has modifying
elements as well (possessors, adjectives, numerals, quantifiers and articles).
Numerals, quantifiers and articles precede the noun; adjectives, as exemplified in
example (4) below, and possessors can be on either side of the head noun.
Modifiers can furthermore be extracted from the noun phrase:
(2)bëmë
wojto‐ø
ti‐tëbë
much/many
pour.out‐3 1SG‐blood
‘Much of my blood is pouring out.’ [AA‐9MA‐6]Possession is marked on the head by means of a cross‐referencing personal prefix,
as can be observed in example (2) above. The noun marked for possession is
usually preceded (but it may also be followed) by the possessor noun phrase:
(3)shunñe a‐pojore
man
3SG.P‐canoe
‘the man’s canoe’Number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which
attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking
case relations mark the more peripheral relations: comitative, instrument, location,
direction and ablative. There is also a postpositional enclitic marking an emphatic
subject. All of this is exemplified in (4). Here it can also be observed that the clitic
status of the plural marker is somewhat doubtful, as it can appear optionally and
in addition to marking the final element, on non‐final elements as well.

‘The woman clubs the man with a big broom.’ (GB‐1MI‐99)Yurakaré is an accusative language, with some ergative characteristics, restricted
to a very small number of verbs. Subjects are suffixed to the verb, objects are
prefixed. Yurakaré predicate roots are either intransitive or transitive. These basic
valencies can be extended to maximally three head‐marked arguments with the
help of an elaborated system of five different applicatives (comitative, co‐
operative, objective, indirect object and affected object). Examples of such verb
roots with extended valency are the following:10Introduction(5)abti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma
1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG
‘Give them to me!’
ti‐ma‐la‐che‐m
1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐2SG.S
‘You ate them from me.’The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (5) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (5) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Yurakaré, in other words, is a pro‐drop
language.
Many temporal, modal and aspectual distinctions are marked by means of
suffixes, which come right after valency changing morphology (the middle voice
marker and causative, which are suffixed), but before the person markers. This
taken together with the object cross‐referencing prefixes and applicative markers
discussed above complete the template of the Yurakaré verb:
(6)object cross ref. ‐ applicatives ‐ root ‐ valency ‐ TMA ‐ subject cross ref.","[24, 25, 26]"
"Palmer (2001:22) mentions that habitual past may be marked as irrealis in the languages
of the world, though it is not very common.
25 Note that the combination of a future event and a ya‐type subordination does not
automatically lead to a purposive interpretation. As can be seen in (64)c, these
constructions can also get the interpretation of a ‘before’‐clause. Note also that in this case
the order of the predicates is not iconically motivated.
24302The clauseSimple conditional clauses with a ya‐clause are exemplified in (65):
(65) ablëtëmë=chi ka‐mala=ya
konsono ujwa‐cha‐m
ta‐tiba chajmu
jungle=DIR 3SG‐go.SG=NVR well

2SG‐IO‐nice‐ADV
work=NVR work‐JUS‐2SG.S
‘If you like working, then work!’ [MH‐27MA‐17]The example in (65)a can also be interpreted as a temporal clause, but (65)b is a
clear example of a conditional clause.
Purposive clauses can also be encoded by means of ya‐clauses:
(66) abcmala=ya
ayee‐m
losko=chi
go.SG=NVR vomit‐IMP.SG creek=DIR
‘Go to the creek to vomit!’ (OR‐19MA‐30)

‘After one week our grandfathers went fishing again.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)Note that the future event of the purposive clause can either be expressed in the
subordinated clause, as in (66)c, or in the main clause, as in (66)a and b.
Finally, coordinate clauses of the type ‘x & y’ can be represented as a ya‐clause
construction if the subjects of the two events are the same and both events fall
under the scope of the same TMA morphemes expressing irrealis:

"8.1.3 Transitive verbs
As far as subjects of the transitive verb (A) are concerned, we see that they are left
unexpressed much more often than intransitive subjects (S), cf. 8.1.1 above. The
fact that overtly expressed noun phrases appear more freely in intransitive subject
or direct object roles (O) than in transitive subject role is a universal tendency,
which “is evidenced widely in the spontaneous discourse of virtually all
languages investigated to date” (Du Bois 2003:48). This phenomenon has to do
with the fact that new information is typically expressed in either intransitive
subject or transitive object role, positions more salient than the transitive subject
position.
As far as the position of overtly expressed subjects is concerned, there is a slight
tendency for A to favor the postverbal position. Nevertheless, this preference is
much weaker than in intransitive verbs, where 85.3% of all overtly expressed S‐
arguments is realized in post‐verbal position, whereas only 55.8% of all overt A‐
arguments of inherently transitive verbs is expressed post‐verbally. This
difference can possibly be attributed to the emphatic function of the preverbal
position, as will be discussed in section 8.1.6.
The percentage of direct objects left unexpressed (58.4%) is comparable to the
percentage of non‐expressed S‐arguments (62.5%) in intransitives. This fact seems
to support the claim that, as far as information‐structure goes, the S‐position and
the O‐position have similar functions: they are equally equipped for introducing
new linguistic material.
The position of overt O’s is rather unpredictable, in the sense that there does not
seem to be a clear preference for either preverbal or postverbal O’s. I will discuss
this matter in section 8.1.6.",[290]
"I include momentaneous and ‘se’ here, in spite of their more aspectual values, because
they also have clear modal values.
8 The imperative and prohibitive actually replace the person markers.

I have not encountered all logically possible combinations of the different
epistemic morphemes. This does, of course, not mean that they are impossible.
The combinations that do occur are mostly not very common. For most
combinations, therefore, it is of no use making any general remarks about their
combined meaning. The point of this section is to show which combinations have
been found and in which order. Remarks about the meaning should be taken as ad
hoc assessments. I have found the following combinations:

straightforwardly as the sum of the parts.

"147A grammar of YurakaréThe entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (1) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (1) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Polysynthesis in the strong sense (termed
incorporating in Comrie 1989a) does not apply to Yurakaré. The language does
not allow noun incorporation into a verb, and nominal compounding, although it
occurs (cf. section 3.2.4), is not a very frequent process.
Another way to characterize the morphology of a language is head‐marking
versus dependent‐marking, proposed as a typological parameter by Nichols
(1986). Yurakaré has characteristics of both types, although the language is
basically head marking. Possessive relations are head marked, cf. example (2), as
are core grammatical relations subject and direct object, and applied objects, cf.

‘The old woman was crying in our language.’ (OR‐20MA‐10)Whether arguments are head or dependent marked furthermore has to do with
topicality. The more topical a referent, the more likely it is head marked (cf. Van
Gijn 2005).
The noun yarru (which loses its geminate consonant when it carries the possessive
prefixes) is inherently plural, cf. section 4.2.","[62, 63]"
"1.2 The Yurakaré language
1.2.1 Previous work
Up until now, the Yurakaré language has received relatively little attention. The
first study devoted completely to the language was La Cueva (1893). This
publication had been prepared by the Franciscan priest La Cueva at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. His notes were brought to France by Alcides d’Orbigny
and edited by Lucien Adam who eventually published them in 1893 8. The
publication consists of a grammatical description and a word list.
The grammatical description, taking up 52 pages, covers many different areas:
from sounds to nominal and verbal morphosyntax, interjections and conjunctions,
as well as some example sentences. The word list covers 68 pages and is Spanish‐
Yurakaré. It is a rich source containing highly valuable material. It is also the first
attempt to devise a spelling for the language, even though this proposal is not
made explicit in the grammar.
The next study devoted to the language is also by a Franciscan priest, Lassinger
(1915). This is a grammatical description, which is much more modest in
comparison to La Cueva’s work. It consists of around 15 pages, which give
information about nominal and verbal conjugations. There is no word list.
Lassinger’s work has been reprinted in Ribera et al. (1991).
In 1980 and 1991, Marge Day produced two further important studies: a rather
large word list both Yurakaré‐Spanish (115 pages) and Spanish‐Yurakaré (123
pages), and a didactic grammar. In this grammar a consistent spelling is devised
(cf. section 2.2), and the study of the grammatical characteristics is taken out of theBrinton (1891:297) summoned publishers to publish the manuscript of La Cueva. This
possibly may have led to the publication two years later.",[21]

rootThe indirect object precedes the affected object, direct object, comitative object, and the
purposive object. We cannot say much about the place of the cooperative object, except
that it appears before the direct object. The affected object precedes the direct object
and the comitative object. Direct object, comitative object and purposive object share
the slot immediately before the applicative markers; they cannot be combined. There is
one position for an applicative marker. When two applied objects are combined that
have a separate applicative marker, one of these objects is always the indirect object; in
this case the applicative marker for indirect object is lost. In some circumstances this
results in a vowel change in the cross‐referencing prefixes from /a/ to /u/. Some
speakers only change the indirect object cross‐referencing prefixes, others also the
prefixes referring to the purposive object.","[182, 183, 184]"
"8.1.4 Extended intransitives
Extended intransitives are verbs that have a basic valency of one, to which one
argument is added by means of an applicative construction:275A grammar of Yurakaré(16) abti‐la‐mala‐ø
1SG‐AFO‐go.SG‐3
‘He left me behind.’
të‐sawata‐m
1SG.CO‐work‐2SG.S
‘You work with me.’The verbs mala and sawata are basically intransitive verbs, but in (16), there is an
additional argument marked on the verb, in (16)a an affected object, in (16)b a co‐
operative object. I consider all verbs that have a formally marked applied object as
extended verbs.
As can be seen in Table 45, the numbers for the realization of subjects are very
similar for transitive and extended intransitive verbs. Both drop their subjects in
around 81% of the cases, while there is a preference for overt subjects to be
realized postverbally, like with intransitive verbs. I assume that the discourse
status of the subject is the same in transitive and extended intransitive verbs, i.e.
prototypically, highly topical participants are expressed in A position.
There is a difference, though, between the behavior of direct objects of transitive
verbs (O) and applied objects (E) of extended intransitives. Extended intransitives
drop no less than 82.7% of their objects, whereas transitive verbs drop ‘only’
62.5%. These numbers suggest that the direct object position of a transitive verb is
more salient than the applied object position of an extended intransitive verb. In
fact, the number suggests that the salience of the applied object position is at the
level of transitive subjects, i.e. typically topical and accessible information. Onishi
(2000:136‐137), argues that applicatives are often used as discourse structuring
devices in the sense that they identify the topic of the discourse. Since topic is old
information, we would not expect too many overt NP applied objects. In Van Gijn
(2005) I argue that the split between the head‐marking patterns of the applicatives
on the one hand and the case/postposition‐marked adjuncts highly correlates with
topicality and animacy.
When applied objects are overtly expressed, there is a slight preference for the
postverbal position. The numbers are very low, however, so the significance of
these percentages is questionable. In section 8.1.6 I will discuss the different
positions of arguments.","[290, 291]"
"360Curriculum Vitae
Rik van Gijn (Brunssum, Netherlands 01‐03‐1976) began studying Dutch
Language and Literature at the University of Amsterdam in 1994. After receiving
his propedeutics in 1995, he switched to General Linguistics, also at the University
of Amsterdam. During his study he developed interest for Amerindian languages
(he took courses in Quechua and Carib at Leiden University), theoretical
linguistics (both functional and formal) and language contact. In line with this last
interest he spent half a year at the University of Aarhus in Denmark where he took
courses on mixed languages. His thesis, entitled The syllable in mixed languages, was
largely a combination of his main fields of interest. After his studies he started
working as a Ph.D. student at the Radboud University Nijmegen, then still called
the University of Nijmegen, of which this book is the result. He worked for four
and a half years on the description of Yurakaré, under the supervision of Pieter
Muysken and Mily Crevels. He is currently working on the production of a
dictionary Yurakaré‐Spanish, Spanish‐Yurakaré as well as a collection of Yurakaré
myths. Both books are in co‐authorship with Vincent Hirtzel.","[375, 376]"
"3.3.3 Verbs
Verbs are prototypically actions: agentive actions involving concrete participants,
having a relatively short duration, and spatially more diffuse than nouns (Givón
2001‐I:52).
The typical function of a verb is the predicative function (Croft 2003:184‐185,
Schachter 1985:9). This is not a distinguishing feature of verbs in Yurakaré,
however. Nouns and adjectives can also function as (stative) predicates without
any overt formal marking that indicates a change in lexical category.
(86) absë=ja
ulë‐y
1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
‘I was that, I was the guayabochi tree.’ (AR‐8MI‐7)
Arsenio=ja
poropesor‐shta‐ø=la
Arsenio=EMPH teacher‐FUT‐3=VAL
Arsenio will be a teacher.’ [AT‐3MI‐121]Example (86)a is taken from a mythological text in which a Guayabochi tree
changes into a person. Now this person is telling a woman that he was the
Guayabochi tree. The subject sëja is marked with the emphasis marker =ja, which
appears almost exclusively on subjects. Furthermore, the predicate ulëy takes the
subject cross‐reference marker ‐y for first person singular. The word that functions
as a predicate has the notional characteristics of a noun, referring to a concrete,79A grammar of Yurakaréeven specific item. In (86)b the predicate nominal is marked for future tense, a
category normally associated with verbs.
Some predicate nominals can even take applicative prefixes. In the following
examples the affected object applicative (cf. 5.2.4) triggers the interpretation of
detachment in (87)a; in (87)b, the attachment‐reading is caused by the indirect
object applicative (cf. 5.2.3):

latiji
DEL‐3PL‐IO‐tooth‐FUT‐3
subsequently
‘He provided them with teeth.’ (AR‐8MI‐35)In (87)a, the predicate function is performed by a noun, which also refers to a
concrete and specific object. Like in (86)a, this predicate takes subject cross‐
reference marking (for second person singular and plural) and the overtly
expressed subject argument is marked with the emphasis marker =ja. However, in
(87)a we can also see that the object word can take valency increasing morphology
(the prefix la‐ for affected object ‐ cf. section 5.2.4) and consequently an object
complement, referring to the person who got his penis cut off. In (87)b, the
predicate nominal, not specific this time, takes another kind of applicative and is
modified by an adverb. Furthermore it takes the future tense marker ‐shta.
Adjectives can be used as predicates as easily as object‐words (nouns):

meme
what‐entity=EMPH
INTS~2SG‐IO‐beautiful‐HAB‐3
mother
‘What do you find really beautiful, mother?’ (AR‐8MI‐50)In (88)a the property word functions as a predicate (cf. the non‐veridical enclitic
=ya, which only attaches to predicates. In (88)b, the property word yita takes the
subject marker ‐p for second person plural, and in (88)c, shuyulë takes the
applicative marker n‐ as well as the habitual marker ‐jti.
Verbs, in short, cannot be distinguished from adjectives and nouns on the basis
of their function as predicates. However, verbs cannot be arguments of predicates
without any overt marking. They can be arguments of verbs either when they80Morphologyform a compound with the noun bëshë ‘entity’ or under a certain analysis with the
different subject marker =ti (cf. chapter 8.2.4):

DEM=DIRbThere is no clear answer to the question whether the ti‐marked clause indicates a
‘when’‐clause rather than a real argument, i.e.: ‘When I had harvested my rice I
was finished.’ However, ti‐marked clauses can take postpositions, which are
normally associated with noun phrases:

‘We could not walk when we were drunk.’ [FA‐28MA‐1]The sequence poyde winanitu seems to be a case where a verb (winanitu), without
any further measures being taken is used as an argument of the verb (Hengeveld’s
1992 criterion). However, on closer scrutiny, there seem to be measures that have
been taken after all. The matrix verb poyde does not carry any subject marking, and
is conjoined to the adjacent VP. In fact, as I will be discussing in chapter 8.2.1, this
is one way of marking subordination. The matrix verb can also be fully inflected,
but then the complement verb has to be marked by means of the enclitic =ti.

of a compound with bëshë (reduced to pshë) ‘entity’. In (93)c we again see that
nouns can be in adjectival function as long as their meaning allows for it:81A grammar of Yurakaré(93) anashunñe bobo‐y=ti

"71A grammar of Yurakaré3.3 Parts of speech
As is shown in Anward et al. (1997), languages can differ from each other in
several respects when it comes to the inventory of their lexical categories. They
can differ in what kind of categories they identify; the distinction between verbs
and nouns seems to be universal (Schachter 1985:6‐7), though even that is
questioned (cf. Hengeveld 1992:67 for Tuscarora). Adjectives, (manner) adverbs
and smaller parts of speech are not universal at all. Languages can also differ in
terms of the criteria that can be used to distinguish their lexical categories. The
general approach in any language to distinguish lexical categories is that “the
primary, definitional properties of parts of speech are semantic or pragmatic,
rather than form related; (…) semantic or pragmatic features are part‐of‐speech
defining only if there is at least one formal characteristic that correlates with
them” (Anward et al. 1997:172). Formal characteristics can be found on the
syntactic, morphological or phonological level 11. Languages differ as to which of
these formal characteristics correlates with the semantic‐pragmatic features.
These differences, together with the fact that the boundaries between the
different parts of speech are sometimes rather fuzzy (cf. Payne 1997:32), make it a
difficult task to identify the parts of speech of a language. Therefore the
distinctions I have chosen to make, although based on notional, syntactic,
morphological, and sometimes even phonological criteria, do not reflect rigid
classes with clear‐cut boundaries, but rather they reflect tendencies associated
with certain lexical classes.
When these precautions are taken into consideration, we might say that
Yurakaré distinguishes seven lexical classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitic particles. I will discuss each of the parts of
speech in turn, stating their (prototypical) notional, syntactic and morphological
characteristics as well as subclassifications. I will start with nouns (3.3.1), followed
by adjectives (3.3.2), verbs (3.3.3), adverbs (3.3.4), ideophones (3.3.5), interjections
(3.3.6), and finally clitic particles (3.3.7).","[86, 87]"

i‐ ‘verbalizer’
Since nouns and adjectives can occur in predicative position (cf. section 3.3.3), there is
not much need for verbalizing morphology. There is one verbalizing prefix, however: i‐

he has the word’.
‐jta ‘smell’
The suffix ‐jta on a noun means that it smells like what is expressed in the noun:

adjectives to form manner adverbs; ‐ku is harder to interpret, but it may be that it is the127A grammar of Yurakaréku‐ which denotes cooperative object third person (cf. section 5.2.2). The verb ta ‘say’,
which is probably the source for the middle marker ‐tA, takes the cooperative object
applicative form to mark addressees.
First and second person pronouns can take the adverbializer ‐shku as well as ‐sh, but
if they do, they take an intervening morpheme ‐wa:

Apart from the subclassification of nouns proper on the basis of number and collective
marking (cf. section 4.2), the class of nouns can be further subdivided into a number of
subclasses. First, we can distinguish pronouns. There are three types of pronouns:
demonstrative, personal and the question word ama.
Personal pronouns
There are four personal pronouns in Yurakaré:
(112) sëë
mëë
tuwa
paaI
you (sg)
we
you (pl)There is no inclusive/exclusive distinction for first person plural. Third person
pronouns are indicated by demonstrative pronouns, which will be discussed later in
this section. Personal pronouns are distinguished from other nouns firstly on the basis
of plural marking. They are the only nominal forms that have suppletive plural forms.
Second, as mentioned in 4.4.4, personal pronouns behave differently when the
adverbializer ‐shku is added, cf. example (111). Furthermore, they are restricted with
respect to derivational morphology. The only derivational affixes that I have found on
personal pronouns are limitative ‐jti and adverbializer ‐shku(ta). Personal pronouns
cannot be possessed either. Yurakaré is a pro‐drop language, so personal pronouns can
be left out. This will be discussed in section 8.1.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"
"3.1 Introducing Yurakaré morphology
From the perspective of morphological typology, Yurakaré can be characterized as
an agglutinating language. In the ideal case of an agglutinating language “a word
may consist of more than one morpheme, but the boundaries between morphemes
in the word are always clear‐cut” (Comrie 1989a:43). This characterization fits
Yurakaré morphology to a high degree. There is some fusion, however, especially
within the system of participant reference on the verb. Here the categories of
person and number are fused, and sometimes also semantic function (e.g. in the
cross‐referencing system, cf. section 5.1). On the whole, however, Yurakaré
morphology provides us with a fairly straightforward picture of an agglutinating
language.
On another dimension, isolating versus polysynthetic, Yurakaré can be placed
more towards the polysynthetic end, as was suggested already by the morpheme
per word ratio. I take polysynthetic to mean the possibility “to combine a large
number of morphemes, be they lexical or grammatical, into a single word,
corresponding to a sentence of English” (Comrie 1989a:45). Yurakaré, with its
elaborate person reference system and applicatives (cf. sections 5.1 and 5.2) fits
this description. To give an example, consider the following:
(1)abti‐ma‐y‐mala‐ma
1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG
‘Go and get them for me!’ [AA‐15MA‐9]
ti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø
1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3
‘He ate them from me (e.g. from my plate).’ [MV‐14MA‐26]I have not counted zero morphemes and I have counted bound roots + required
derivational morphemes as one. I did count enclitics. The total number of words was 6,976,
the total number of morphemes 14,289.",[62]

have a marked opposition singular versus plural; class II nouns are inherently plural

are inherently singular and inherently collective.
As can be observed in Table 32, the marker ka‐ as an indicator of third person
singular direct objects only occurs with class III nouns in some cases and with class IV
nouns in all cases. In constructions such as in (3), ka‐ is used as a cross‐reference marker
for all third persons singular, no matter what nominal class. In Table 33, an overview is
given of the paradigms of the direct object and the comitative object with regard to
class I nouns:

exemplified in (3)b and c, is related to verbal number (cf. section 6.2.2). A handful of
verbs in Yurakaré vary in their form according to the number of participants taking
part in the event. This system of participant‐based verbal number is organized
according to an ergative pattern: intransitive verbs change form according to the
number of the S argument, transitive verbs change according to the number of the O
argument, a pattern universally attested in languages that have such a system of
participant based verbal number (cf. Corbett 2000: 253):

‘I threw them away.’146Verbal agreement, voice & valencyThe verb roots mala (for singular) and bali (for plural) change according to the
number of the subject participant, cf. (4)a and b; chitta and kokko 2 in (4)c and d, change
according to the number of the direct object participant. With an extended intransitive
like ka‐mala‐ø, the number of object participants has no consequences for the form of
the verb: it still changes according to the number of the subject participant. In other
words: the ergative pattern of verbal plural marking is sensitive only to the transitivity
value of the root.

‘They take it with them.’In these two respects (i.e. consistant overt marking of third person singular direct
object and no influence on participant based verbal number) the comitative object
construction patterns with other, more clearly marked applicative constructions.
There is another construction worth mentioning in the context of the discussion on
transitivity and valency in Yurakaré:

1SG‐necklace=PL
3PL‐fall.SG‐3=PL
‘My necklace fell.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]In these constructions, the verb is still semantically intransitive, but formally, two
participants are marked: the zero element for subject and ka‐ for object in (6)a 3, and the
third person plural prefix ma‐ for object and the markers ‐ø and =w together for third
person plural subject. Tulujta ‘brain’ is a class III noun, tenchew ‘necklace’ a class II
noun. It seems that the verbs in (6) agree twice with the S‐participant. There is some
evidence, however, that the object agreement only refers to the number of the
participants, and not to the person:The form jokko is a surface variant of kokko: /k/ changes into [h], spelled j after a vowel, cf.
section 2.3.2.

The meaning of this construction, which is found with intransitive verbs indicating
some state or change of state, is not entirely transparent, but in most cases it seems to
stress the fact that we are dealing with a coherent collective or bounded piece of mass
that is affected in some way. In relation to this, it is mostly found when S participants
are of class II or IV, which are inherently collective nouns.","[160, 161, 162, 163]"

‘They always hammered until they were caught by the night.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (83)a, there is a simple predicate ensew, modified by the adverb chajti, which directly
follows it. Even though I have never encountered chajti in preverbal position, it does
not seem impossible, especially when the meaning is stressed.
This adverb often has a wide scope. In (83)a, the scope of the adverb extends to the
location mentioned. They did not ‘always just drink’, but ‘they always drank there’. In
(83)b, the adverb has scope over the entire proposition isamaya malaya chërë. And for
(83)c, finally, the same argumentation can be given: the adverb has scope over the
whole proposition. In addition, the repetition in this example already indicates
iterativity.
There can be elements in between the predicate and the adverb, like direct objects, cf.
(84)a, applied objects, cf. (84)b, and even adjuncts, cf. (84)c:

‘They always waited for their husbands like that with chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)It may very well be the case that chajti has a verbal origin, and to some extent it still
functions as a predicate. There are two parts recognizable within the word: cha and jti.
The latter is the marker for habitual aspect, and the former is seen in many words
based on the demonstrative ati (cf. section 4.4.4 above):
(85) ati
achu(ta)
(a)chama‘that’
‘(be) like that’
‘(do/be) like that’The word chajti then probably means ‘it is (was) always like that’. Another clue
pointing to the verbal nature of chajti, is the fact that it often occurs with the non‐213A grammar of Yurakaréveridical enclitic =ya, normally only associated with predicates (cf. section 7.1.1). On the
other hand, it does not fully behave like a verb in the sense that when two clauses are
combined there often is an intonation break and morphological marking on the
dependent predicate; if there is no intonation break, there is a fixed order, in which the
dependent predicate precedes the main predicate. Chajti does not comply with this
behavior.
The adverb lacha ‘too’ or its variant layj also seems to have a relation to the
demonstrative ati, with the specificity prefix l‐. Positionally, lacha is mostly postverbal,
either directly following the predicate or with some other element in between:

others of the mororuma. In (86)b, the former grandfathers are contrasted with other
people who are also fishing at the creek. In (86)c, finally, the whole proposition of the
former grandfathers making their arrows is marked with the adverb.
Lacha can, however, also be in clause‐initial position:

Unlike temporal and aspectual adverbs, modal adverbs tend to precede the predicate.
The negative adverb nish (~nij), the phasal adverbs kaj ‘still’, and kani ‘not yet’ as well
as sey (si) ‘almost’ directly precede the predicate:214The verb phrase(88) abcdnishbata‐p

a‐yee
almost 3SG‐AFO‐die.SG‐3=NVR
3SG.P‐sister
‘His sister almost died on him.’ (AY‐2NC‐9)The adverbs kaj, nish and sey are somewhat deviant words in that they are
monosyllabic, while there is a prohibition on monosyllabic content words. This is
something that they have in common with a number of state/manner adverbs (cf.
section 6.5.6). Manner adverbs, as we will see below, are also preverbal.
Some of the modal adverbs are morphologically transparent. The negative adverb
nish has an independent form nijta (i.e. which can occur without a verb), which seems
to be nij + ta (middle voice marker) meaning, ‘there is no(ne)’. The form nish has ‐sh,
which is an adverbializing suffix. The adverb kani also seems to be a fused form,
combining kaj and ni (negative).
Two further, epistemic modal adverbs seem to be intermediate between adverbs and
verbs: yokkoshe ‘true’ and kusuti ‘maybe’.

latiji

moon‐3=DS big‐MEA‐3=NVR
subsequently
‘After maybe two months, he was already big.’ (AR‐8MI‐27)In (89) yokkoshe and kusuti are used adverbially here. Yokkoshe, however, can occur by
itself, without a predicate to modify, a characteristic not associated with adverbs in
Yurakaré:
(90) yokkoshe mem=la
nish
ta‐n‐shiwa‐m=la

‘“It is true, mother, you did not lie to us”, they said to her.’ (AR‐8MI‐31)215A grammar of YurakaréThe end of the first clause yokkoshe memla is marked by the affirmative marker =la, this
means that yokkoshe here functions as a predicate.
Kusuti seems to be a fixed expression which can be analyzed as kusu‐ø=ti, ‘if it wants’.
Kusu is a verb meaning ‘to want’, =ti is a subordinating enclitic, expressing, among
other things conditionality (cf. section 8.2.4).","[227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"

"296The clauseIn (54)a, the clause combination chitta mala is as a whole subordinate to the verb
timbë. This means that the subject of chitta mala is not indicated on either of these
verbs, but rather it is marked as the direct object of ibëbë. In (54)b, the construction
tëshujuta timbë, which in itself is a clause combination, is superordinate to the
subject clause abëssëyti. The construction with the subordinate marker =ti will be
discussed in section 8.2.4 below. Note that, even though the causee is marked on
the verb timbë in (54)b, it is also marked on the dependent verb, as a cooperative
object. 20 Apparently subject agreement is blocked, but object agreement is not,
even though we are dealing with coreference.
This morphosyntactic type of clause combinations is used when the two events
are inextricably interwoven. States of affairs that are encoded in this way are
manner clauses, like the ones discussed above, where the leftmost, subordinated
verb can be replaced by a manner adverb:
(55) achu
ti‐m‐bë‐ø
like.that
1SG‐IO‐treat‐3
‘Like that he did to me.’These manner verbs can also be path‐movement verbs or location‐manner verbs
combining with a semantically more or less empty movement verb like mala/bali
‘go’ or winani ‘walk’.
Some complement relations can be expressed as VP‐conjunctions.
Complementation can be defined as “the syntactic situation that arises when a
notional sentence or predicate is an argument” (Noonan 1985:42). Normally,
complementation in Yurakaré is marked by the subordinating particle =ti (cf.
section 8.2.4), as in (54)b. Some complement relations, however, can additionally
be represented as follows:

ti‐arush
1SG‐rice
1SG‐IO‐finished 3PL‐take.PL‐1SG.S=DSC
‘I’m done harvesting my rice. [FL‐24MA‐1]The predicate pëlë ‘be finished’ can take a nominal subject:

subject argument has been replaced by another predicate. This combination of
This is due to the semantics of the verb shujuta ‘to sweat’. The experiencer of sweating is
always indicated as a cooperative object.","[311, 312]"
"5.2.6 Verbs beginning with /i/160Verbal agreement, voice & valencyTransitive verbs beginning with the sound /i/ usually mark their direct object in a
deviant way. First and second persons and the third person plural are encoded as an
indirect object:
(36) abcdti‐n‐dëjta‐m
1SG‐IO‐miss‐2SG.S
‘You miss me.’ [MH‐8MA‐14]
lëshie=w ma‐n‐du‐shti

së=ja
ma‐n‐ñese‐shti
palanta=w
1SG.PRN=EMPH 3PL‐IO‐sow;plant‐FUT:1SG.S banana=PL
‘I am going to plant bananas.’ [FL‐20MA‐27]Underlyingly, all of the verb roots in (36) begin with the vowel /i/: idëjta ‘to miss’, idu
‘to fry’, idumaja ‘to molest’ and iñese ‘to sow, plant’. The participant encoded as an
indirect object here is slightly different from normal indirect‐object marking. The third
person singular is cross‐referenced with zero, i.e. as a ‘normal’ direct object, which is
evidence that we are in fact not dealing with indirect objects, but rather with direct
objects that are marked in a deviant manner:
(37) abidu‐ma

‘Fry a banana!’ [HC‐23MA‐3]
ëshë idumaja‐shta‐m=chi
mi‐tëjte
why molest‐FUT‐2SG.S=IGN 2SG‐grandmother
‘Why are you going to bother, cause trouble to your grandmother?’ (AR‐8MI‐46)Apparently there is some rule that says that the direct objects of transitive verb roots
beginning with /i/ are encoded as indirect objects, except for third person singular.
When for instance a beneficiary or a recipient is added, this is expressed as an affected
object:
(38) ti‐l‐idu‐ma
1SG‐AFO‐fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]The affected object applied to a verb beginning with /i/ differs slightly in form, in that
the /a/ of the prefix la‐ is dropped:161A grammar of YurakaréHowever, there are instances where the indirect object does indicate a beneficiary, as
in the case with idu ‘fry’:
(39) ti‐n‐du‐ma
1SG‐IO‐fry‐IMP.SG
‘Fry it for me!’ [FL‐23MA‐1]It may be that the pragmatically marked meaning that a direct object interpretation
would yield here, forces the indirect object interpretation. Nevertheless, it is unclear
what the difference is between (38) and (39). In most cases the affected object takes over
the ‘vacancy’ left open by the indirect object, marking beneficiary/recipient‐type
participants:

‘He tied it for me.’

1SG.CO‐cold‐3
‘I am cold.’
ku‐shujuta‐ø
3SG.CO‐warm‐3
‘He is warm, sweating.’ [AA‐12MA‐28]Cooperative objects can also be sympathetic experiencers:An alternative analysis would be that we are dealing with a verb le with a purposive object.
This would mean that we should analyze le as a movement verb. There is one other cognitive
verb that is based on a movement verb:
i. ku‐y‐mal‐uma‐ø
3SG.CO‐VPL‐go.SG‐DST‐3
‘He is thinking.’
10 The fact that we are dealing with a direct object here is evidenced by the fact that a third
person singular is cross‐referenced by a zero form.
9163A grammar of Yurakaré(45) të‐benebene‐ø
1SG.CO‐lamentable‐3
‘I am sympathizing with him, who is pitiful.’ [HC‐22MA‐6]Experiencers that undergo some emotion because they evaluate something as being
e.g. beautiful are often encoded as indirect objects:
(46) abti‐n‐kukku‐ø
1SG‐IO‐nice‐3
‘I like it.’
ti‐m‐pëlë‐ø
1SG‐IO‐finished‐3
‘I finished it.’Whereas the experiencers in (46) have control over the situation, especially in (46)b,
experiencers that lack any control are generally marked as affected objects:
(47) abti‐la‐ñolele‐ø
1SG‐AFO‐desirable‐3
‘I want it, I feel desire for it’
li‐ti‐la‐sheta‐ø
DEL‐1SG‐AFO‐lost‐3
‘I forgot it (it escaped me).’There is one predicate that I am aware of that takes a direct object as an experiencer:
(48) ti‐jusu‐ø
1SG‐want‐3
‘I want it.’The question with all of these verbs is whether they are one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects, or two place verbs of the type of English ‘please’ in ‘It
pleases me.’ The answer to this question can only be given for some of these predicates.
The predicate kukku ‘(be) nice’ is a word describing a property, which can be used as a
one‐place predicate:

na
yee
NEG
nice‐3=NVR

kukku‐jti‐ø ana‐kki

(50) ti‐n‐kukku‐m
1SG‐IO‐nice‐2SG
‘I like you.’ [FL‐3MA‐5]Other experiencer predicates behaving like this are, among others: ñolele ‘desirable’,
sheta ‘lost’ pëlë ‘finished’, benebene ‘lamentable’, shujuta ‘hot’, and dyummë ‘cold’.
Problematic for this analysis are kusu 11 ‘want’ and ile ‘know’. These verbs do not
occur as one‐place predicates, nor do they take any phonetically salient subject
markers 12, a fact which renders an analysis as two‐place predicates problematic. These
verbs are probably best analyzed as impersonal verbs or as one‐place verbs with non‐
canonically marked subjects. In fact, Malchukov (in prep.) suggests that constructions
with non‐canonically marked subjects can in fact come about as reanalyses of
impersonal constructions. This historical change may be corroborated by the fact that
Day (1980‐40) 13 marks the following utterances as grammatical:

‘Which songs do you (pl) know?’When confronted with these examples, consultants rejected them as ungrammatical. It
may be that in the regions I worked the construction has been reanalyzed.
I should also mention a handful of examples where the experiencer is a possessor (cf.
also section 4.4.1):Kusu is the underlying form which changes to jusu when preceded by a vowel.

13 Even though Day printed her material in 1980, she has been working with the Yurakarés since
the 1950s. The fact that for the most part, she worked in other areas than I did may have
something to do with this too.

primary stress, while the singular possessors almost never receive stress (cf. section
2.4.2 above). The resulting metrical pattern can cause some stems to change:

Almost all non‐animate nouns can be possessed in the way outlined above; there are
some restrictions on animate nouns. Animals, especially domestic animals, need a
classifier in order to be possessed:
(78) a
bti‐tiba

a‐ñishshë=w
3PL‐eat‐FUT‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐louse=PL
‘He was going to eat his lice.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)The explanation for this is that the nature of the possessive relation of a person to his
lice is different from the relationship between a chicken and its owner. In the former
there is simply a locality relation, whereas the latter refers to ownership.
Nouns denoting human beings can only be possessed if the noun denotes a kinship
relation (80), or occasionally a possessor prefix is found on proper names (81):19The gemination appears in the citation form for prosodic reasons (cf. section 2.3.3)117A grammar of Yurakaré(80) abcd(81) abti‐paa

(AA‐27MA‐11)From the examples in (80) it becomes clear that nouns denoting humans can only be
possessed when they express kinship. In (80)d, the fact that yee ‘woman; sister’ is
possessed forces the interpretation of ‘sister’ rather than ‘woman’.
Possession marking in Yurakaré is used to express different kinds of relations
between two entities. Kinship can be extended to express affection: people call each
other ti‐bisi ‘my brother’ or ti‐dyama ‘my sister’ even if no such family relation exists, to
express affection. The possessive markers in (81) on the proper names are other
examples of the affective use of the possessor prefixes.
Part‐whole relations are also expressed by possession:
(82) abkuchilu a‐dala
knife
3SG.P‐head
‘knife‐blade’
waja a‐pëlë
cow
3SG.P‐skin
‘cow‐hide’This part‐whole relation can also be expressed by a compound:118The noun phrase(83) abwaja‐pëlë
cow‐skin
‘cow‐hide’
tanti‐plë
eye‐skin
‘eyelid’The two nouns are simply juxtaposed. Stress normally falls on the final syllable of the
first part of the compound; the head noun is always on the right. Stress placement can
cause stems to change here as well. In example (83)b, the compound is made up of tanti
‘eye’ and pëlë ‘skin’. Stress falls on the final syllable of tanti, and vowel elision takes
place in the first syllable of pëlë consequently. This type of compounding is not used
exclusively for part‐whole relations. It is generally used to indicate a kind of X,
associated with the entity expressed in the first noun:
(84) abtalipa‐newe
chicken‐excrement
‘chicken‐dirt’
dulsi‐sa
orange‐fruit
‘fruit of the orange tree’Some experiencer events are expressed by means of a possessive construction, which
can function as a complete sentence:
(85) abca‐wështi‐ø 20
3SG.P‐hunger‐3
‘He is hungry.’
a‐samti‐ø
3SG.P‐thirst‐3
‘He is thirsty.’
a‐dyolti‐ø
3SG.P‐anger‐3
‘He is angry.’In these constructions, the physical or emotional state felt is represented as a possessed
noun, whereby the possessor is the experiencer of this state.
Finally some quantifiers are obligatorily possessed; this will be discussed in section
4.5.2 below.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"8.2 Complex clauses
In this section I will discuss complex constructions, consisting of two or more
combined predicates. There are two parameters involving the coding of complex
clauses in Yurakaré: first, the inflection on the verb (i.e. do the combined
predicates have the same range of possibilities marking TMA and person
agreement?) and second, specific morphemes indicating subordination.
Starting with subordinating 12 morphemes, there are three different enclitics that
can have a subordinating function: =ya, =ja and =ti. They indicate different degrees
of semantic unity with the main predicate, as will become clear in the following
sections. Furthermore, there is a limited set of independent words indicating that
two clauses should be considered together. This latter construction is mostly
confined to coordination.
Regarding the form of the verb, Stassen (1985) makes a distinction between
balancing and deranking strategies. A verb form is considered to be deranked if it
differs from an independent verb form in the sense that it has limited or different
possibilities for marking TMA and argument agreement. A dependent verb form
is considered to be balanced if it has the form of an independent verb, with all its
TMA and agreement. In Yurakaré, in combination with the three subordinating
morphemes, the following possibilities are attested, examples of each construction
will follow in the next sections (8.2.1‐8.2.5):

As can be seen in Table 51, there is a deranked subordinate form not marked by a
special subordinating morpheme 13. In these constructions, subordination is
With subordinate predicates I mean predicates that are functionally and grammatically
dependent on another predicate either because they share subject markers and/or TMA
morphemes with it, or because they are marked for having the same or a different subject
than the main predicate. Subordination in this view does not necessarily mean that the
subordinate verb form is deranked.
13 It is not clear whether it is possible to speak of a deranked form here, since it rather
seems a construction involving a complex predicate; nevertheless, the leftmost verb in
these constructions seems to have more inflectional possibilities.
12290The clausemarked by the fact that subject agreement and TMA marking are not present on
the deranked predicate.
Subordinate forms with =ya are also deranked; they show no subject agreement
and in their marking of TMA distinctions they are dependent on the main
predicate. There are also independent clauses marked with =ya. In those
circumstances =ya indicates non‐veridical modality (cf. section 7.1.1).
The column under =ja has two ‘+’‐values. With this I mean that there are both
balanced and deranked constructions marked with =ja. I will discuss the relevant
conditions in 8.2.3 below.
Clauses marked with =ti have the full range of possibilities for marking TMA
and person marking. The difference with the balanced versions of =ja‐marked
clauses is that the =ja clauses must have the same subject as the main predicate 14,
while =ti marked clauses normally have a subject different from that of the main
predicate. Moreover, =ti is the only subordinating morpheme that can be further
specified by means of a postposition (cf. section 8.2.4).
In the last column of Table 51, there is an unmarked, balanced combination of
clauses. This means that the combined predicates each have the full range of
possibilities of person marking and TMA‐marking. The meaning of the
combination can be specified by means of an independent word. Most of these
constructions are coordinated.
The five strategies mentioned in Table 51 form a continuum: from left to right
the grammatical integration with the main predicate is increasingly lower.
According to Givón (2001b:40), “the stronger the semantic bond between the two
events, the more extensive will be the syntactic integration of the two clauses into
a single though complex clause”. This means that a decline of grammatical
coherence should coincide with a decrease of semantic coherence with the main
predicate.
In the next sections (8.2.1‐8.2.5) I will describe the five strategies used for clause
combining in turn, indicating their formal and functional properties. In section
8.2.6 I give some alternative strategies used to encode clause combinations. In
section 8.2.7, finally, I will give an overview of the types of clause combinations
and the way they are marked.","[305, 306]"
"7277A grammar of Yurakaréthe role of applied objects differ across extended intransitives and extended
transitives.
With regard to the position of overtly expressed direct objects (preverbal or
postverbal), not much can be said. In transitive verbs the odds are roughly even.
In ditransitive verbs there seems to be a slight preference for the preverbal
position, but the number of occurences is too small to draw any reliable
conclusions. There does seem to be a slight preference for postverbal position for
the applied objects, although, again, the number of instances of ditransitive verbs
is too low to draw firm conclusions.
In most instances (82%), only one or none of the three arguments is overtly
expressed. This can be seen as another instantiation of what Du Bois (2003:68) calls
the One Lexical Argument Constraint:
(18) Avoid more than one lexical core argumentThe idea behind this constraint is that, even if verbs provide in their argument
structure more than one core argument position, only one of them will be used to
introduce a lexical noun phrase. The others are mainly used for referents that have
already been mentioned in the discourse. These latter argument positions are
more often expressed either by pronouns or by zero forms. As with two‐place
verbs, in three‐place verbs, the position of the direct object is the preferred
position to introduce new referents. This apparently is a pervasive pattern in
discourse throughout the languages of the world.","[292, 293]"
"154Verbal agreement, voice & valencyThe beneficiary reading of the direct object can be observed in the following
instances:
(23) abcti‐n‐dula‐ø
ti‐sibë
1SG‐IO‐do;make‐3 1SG‐house
‘He made me my house.’ [RF‐16MA‐12]

ti‐n‐tëptë‐ø
ti‐bëshë
1SG‐IO‐wash‐3
1SG‐entity 6
‘She washed my clothes for me.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]Verbs denoting states, processes or achievements also often carry this applicative. The
indirect object denotes the person that benefits from the state of affairs that has arisen:
(24) abcdti‐n‐duta‐ø
ayma
1SG‐IO‐burn‐3 fire
‘The fire is burning (after I prepared it).’ [AA‐17MA‐2]

ti‐n‐suwita‐ø
ti‐ballata
NEG
1SG‐IO‐come.up‐3
1SG‐plant.seed
‘My plants are not coming up.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]In all of the examples in (24) the indirect object profits somehow from the coming
about of a state. This benefit often has to do with the fact that the indirect object is the
possessor of one of the core participants, a construction known as external possession.
Core instances of external possession are described as “constructions in which a
semantic possessor‐possessum relation is expressed by coding the possessor as a core
grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains
the possessum” (Payne & Barshi 1999:3). Note that we are not dealing with possessor
raising here, since the possessor may still be marked on the noun, as is the case in
(24)b‐d.
The indirect object can sometimes also mark a detrimentally affected dative of
interest:
Bëshëë (which loses its final vowel when prefixed with a singular possessive prefix) has a
rather vague meaning, but it is often interpreted as ‘clothing’, sometimes ‘game’ for hunting.","[169, 170]"
"5153A grammar of YurakaréThis applicative construction has several related meanings. First, with verbs of
movement or caused‐movement verbs such as ‘giving’, ‘sending’ and the like, it
indicates the goal of that movement, or the recipient.

where the indirect object encodes the addressee:

‘I am going to inform you.’ (AR‐8MI‐46)

‘He is calling me.’ [HC‐23MA‐5]
ti‐n‐dyajuya‐m
1SG‐IO‐gossip‐2SG.S
‘You are telling me gossip.’ [VP‐6MA‐29]Apart from these two related meanings, the indirect object indicates an interested
party, often called ‘ethical dative’, ‘dative of (dis)advantage’ or ‘dative of interest’ (cf.
Payne 1997:192‐194, Palmer 1994:32). Semantically, an ethical dative construction can
be described as follows: “The circumstances described by the predicate have significant
consequences for the interested party, whose referent is not in control of the event”
(Fried 1999:492). The type of interest that is indicated by this kind of construction can,
in many languages be either beneficiary or adversative, without any formal distinction
(cf. Shibatani 1994:463). In Yurakaré, however, these two subtypes of the ethical dative
have different formal encodings, with which they more or less coincide. The ‘indirect
object’ encoding, with the prefix n‐, is by and large associated with goal/approach and
beneficiary, while the ‘affected object’ encoding, with the prefix la‐ which is discussed
in section 5.2.4 below, is associated with source/separation and adversity.","[168, 169]"

Dit proefschrift geeft een overzicht van de basiskenmerken van de grammatica
van het Yurakaré. Yurakaré is een Indianentaal gesproken door ongeveer 2500
mensen in een groot gebied in centraal Bolivia, aan de voet van de Andes. Het
boek bestaat uit acht hoofdstukken, en is als volgt opgebouwd.
Hoofdstuk 1 ‘Introduction’ geeft relevante geografische, demografische en
historische achtergronden van de Yurakaré indianen. Vervolgens wordt op
schetsmatige wijze de Yurakaré taal besproken: eerdere studies van de taal,
mogelijke familietalen en een korte typologische schets. Het laatste deel van dit
hoofdstuk is toegespitst op het huidige onderzoek. Hier wordt besproken hoe het
veldonderzoek is verlopen, wat voor technieken er zijn gebruikt en wie de
consultanten waren. Ook in dit deel een samenvatting van de belangrijkste
mythologische teksten.
Hoofdstuk 2 behandelt de fonologie van de taal. In het eerste deel worden de
betekenisonderscheidende klanken van de taal geïntroduceerd, waar nodig
worden de klanken gecontrasteerd met andere klanken. Ook wordt in dit deel kort
besproken wat er gebeurt met niet inheemse klanken die opgenomen worden in
de taal. In het tweede gedeelte wordt beschreven hoe deze klanken worden
gerepresenteerd in het orthografisch systeem. Syllabestructuur, fonologische
processen en een beschrijving van het klemtoonsysteem sluiten het hoofdstuk af.
Hoofdstuk 3 is een introductie van de morfologie (woordvorming) van het
Yurakaré. Hier vindt men een beschrijving van alle typen morfemen en
woordvormingsprocessen van de taal (woorden, stammen, prefixen, suffixen,
reduplicatie, samenstellingen, clitica en woordinterne veranderingen). Ook wordt
hier beargumenteerd welke lexicale klassen worden onderscheiden en op basis
waarvan. Het Yurakaré telt zeven woordklassen: naamwoorden, bijvoeglijke
naamwoorden, werkwoorden, bijwoorden, ideofonen, interjecties en enclitische
partikels.
In hoofdstuk 4 wordt de interne structuur en de morfologie van de
naamwoordfrase besproken. Eerst worden categorieën die relevant zijn voor de
naamwoordfrase als geheel besproken, zoals getal en de markering van
grammaticale relaties door middel van postposities. Vervolgens worden de twee
woordsoorten die met name voorkomen binnen de naamwoordfrase afzonderlijk
besproken. Eerst naamwoorden, met daarbij een beschrijving van de uitdrukking
van bezit, derivationele morfologie en een subclassificatie van de naamwoorden,
daarna volgt een bespreking van de bijvoeglijke naamwoorden die in twee
subklassen worden verdeeld: kwalificerende en kwantificerende bijvoeglijke
naamwoorden.
Hoofdstuk 5 richt zich op hoe participanten in een situatie of gebeurtenis
worden gemarkeerd op het werkwoord voor de rol die ze in die situatie hebben.
Er wordt uitgegaan van een basis markeringssysteem waarin het onderwerp en359A grammar of Yurakaréhet lijdend voorwerp op het werkwoord gemarkeerd worden; op basis hiervan
wordt uitgelegd hoe deze basisstructuur van twee participanten kan worden
uitgebreid met allerlei applicatieve constructies. In het tweede gedeelte wordt
voice besproken: de middle voice en de causatief.
In hoofdstuk 6 wordt verbale morfologie besproken: tense, mood en aspect
alsmede derivationele morfologie die op het werkwoord gemarkeerd wordt. Ook
is er in dit hoofdstuk een bespreking te vinden van de categorieën die nauw
samenhangen met de werkwoordsfrase: adverbia en ideofonen, alsmede een
bespreking van interjecties.
Hoofdstuk 7 geeft een beschrijving van allerlei verschillende enclitische
partikels, waarvan de meeste gezien kunnen worden als modaal. Er zijn ook een
aantal aspectuele markeerders bij. De focus in dit hoofdstuk ligt op een eerste
benadering van deze partikels, waarbij veel aandacht is voor de context waarin ze
voorkomen en de plaats binnen de zin die ze innemen.
In hoofdstuk 8, tenslotte, wordt de structuur van de zin besproken. Het eerste
gedeelte behandelt de simplexe zin, met één predikaat en één tot drie argumenten.
Besproken wordt pro‐drop, de plaats van de argumenten en het werkwoord in de
zin, pragmatische status van argumenten en soorten zinnen. Het tweede gedeelte
richt zich op combinaties van twee of meer predikaten binnen een zin. Het
behandelt de verschillende types van combinaties, waarbij uitgegaan wordt van
een switch‐reference systeem dat ten grondslag ligt aan veel adverbiale zinnen,
relatieve zinnen en zinscomplementen. Tenslotte worden in dit hoofdstuk
strategieën besproken die gebruikt worden om predicaten te combineren buiten
het systeem van switch‐reference om.
In de appendix zijn nog twee voorbeelden te vinden van gesproken tekst. Een
mythologisch verhaal, Ayma Shunñe (Vuurman), dat integraal is opgenomen en
een gedeelte van een conversatie tussen drie personen.","[368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375]"

The function of ‐tA on nouns is diverse: it can mark an object associated with the entity
expressed by the root (e.g. dala‐ta ‘pillow’, meye‐te ‘earring’), it can be an extension
based on certain functional or physical similarities (e.g. pilë‐të ‘door’, sama‐ta ‘juice’)
and it can also mean ex‐X, marking the past possessive relation (e.g. sibë‐të ‘ex‐house 23,
bashta‐ta 24 ‘ex‐wife’).

the package of the cigarettes.

There are three category‐changing derivational suffixes that can be found on nouns: an
adjectivizer ‐kka, a verbalizer i‐ and an adverbializer ‐shku(ta).
‐kka: ‘measure’
The suffix ‐kka is added mostly to demonstrative pronouns to indicate that the size of
something is comparable to a size indicated (mostly by holding the hand on a certain
height).
(98) ana‐kka‐ø
DEM‐MEA‐3
‘He is this big.’ (indicating height with hand)The suffix ‐kka changes the nominal element into an adjectival one; consequently it can
receive the collective marker ‐ima or the distributive marker ‐uma:
(99) a‐werta
ana‐kk‐ima
3SG.P‐basket
DEM‐MEA‐COL
‘His basket was about this big.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)It is also found on proper names (100), as well as on the question word ama (101):
(100) ti‐tëë

1SG‐niece;nephew
Karina‐MEA

‘She was the size of Karina.’ (BT‐27MA‐10)

2SG‐want‐3 1PL‐field
2SG‐IO‐do;make‐INTL:1SG.S=DS
‘What size would you like me to make our field?’ (AR‐8MI‐41)The suffix ‐kka in the sense of size is often found in combination with the amplification
marker ‐lë. When this suffix is attached, the marker ‐kka loses its gemination and is124The noun phraserendered ‐ja after a vowel (because of the lenition of [k], see section 2.3.2 above). The
interpretation of this combination is small size:
(102) kumë‐nñu ana‐ja‐lë
ajtilya‐nñu
ti‐ja‐mal‐cha‐m
tree‐DIM
DEM‐MEA‐AMP
splinter‐DIM
1SG‐3SG‐go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
‘Bring me a small tree, only this size, a splinter!’ (OR‐20MA‐2)Even though the marker seems to attach mostly to nominal elements, it can also appear
on the verb abibë ‘to be enough’:
(103) abibë‐kka‐ø‐naja
ta‐jukkulë
be.enough‐MEA‐3‐DSC
1PL‐field
‘Our field is big enough now.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)As mentioned in section 4.3 above, in combination with the locative marker =y and the
ablative marker =jsha, this suffix can also indicate a certain stretch of time:
(104) abnentaya
ati‐kka=y
ka‐toro‐ø
ati
maybe
DEM‐MEA=LOC
3SG‐end‐3
DEM
‘Maybe he died in that time.’ (AR‐8MI‐88)
latijsha dula‐ø
ati‐kka=jsha
kokko
mala‐cha‐m
then
do;make‐3 DEM‐MEA=ABL
throw.PL go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
‘Then he made [salt], and after that time (she said): “Leave me some.”’
(AR‐8MI‐82)In this sense of time reference, the suffix ‐kka seems less rigid as to the word class of the
root it attaches to. This is probably for semantic reasons: to indicate the size of
something presupposes a root that has some size, while in the temporal sense, it only
presupposes a state or event that is (or can be) durative, even though some speakers
have difficulties interpreting the following words 25:These examples are taken from a traditional song, which not many people know anymore.
Consultants said that the language of traditional songs is somewhat different from everyday
speech. Possibly, the examples in (105) are not very good representatives of what is and what is
not possible in the language.","[137, 138, 139, 140]"
"1.2.3 Typological sketch
The basis of Yurakaré phonology is relatively simple. Yurakaré has 18 phonemic
consonants, distinguishing five places and five manners of articulation. There are
voiced counterparts for three of the plosives, as is exemplified in Table 1 below. As
far as vowels are concerned, Yurakaré has a total of seven phonemic vowels. They
are given in Table 2.plosives

uSyllable structure is (C)V(C), with a number of restrictions on which consonants
can be in the coda (cf. section 2.3.1). Morphophonological processes include
lenition (restricted to /k/), assimilation (mostly of consonants), elision (mostly
vowels), and gemination (both vowels and consonants). Stress assignment is more
complex. Yurakaré feet are iambic, counted from left to right; primary stress is
assigned to the rightmost dominant node and the final syllable is extrametrical.
However, there are affixes that bear their own prosodic information. Some affixes
attract (secondary or primary) stress, while yet others avoid being stressed. I call
the former stress‐attracting and the latter stress‐avoiding morphemes. Apart from
these two types of affixes, there are also prosodically neutral affixes and
diacritically marked roots.
Morphologically, Yurakaré can be characterized as an agglutinating language on
the scale of fusion, and fairly polysynthetic on the synthesis index.
(1)ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐m=chi
ku‐ta‐ø=ya
1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN 3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
‘Go and get them for me, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)Verbs are usually morphologically complex, without much fusion. This can be
observed in example (1), where three participants are marked on the verb (ti‐ for
first person singular, ma‐ for third person plural object, and ‐m for second person
singular subject, as well as an applicative marker y‐ specifying the role of the third
person plural object (purposive). The ignorative marker is cliticized onto the verb.
The fact that this utterance in itself is a grammatically correct and complete
sentence illustrates the polysynthetic character of the morphology. There is no
incorporation of lexical items, however. Morpheme boundaries are generally
easily separable in Yurakaré and there is often a one‐form‐one‐meaning
correspondence. There is some fusion, however. As can be seen in example (1),
there is fusion of the categories person and number in cross‐referencing affixes,
and sometimes there is also fusion of grammatical relation markers with person
and number, as is the case with ku‐ in kutaya. In the case of the imperative there is
fusion of ‘imperative’ and number.
Yurakaré distinguishes seven wordclasses: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitics. The last three may possibly be subsumed
under the higher‐level category of particles.","[23, 24]"
"1172Morphologysemantic head of the noun phrase. This can be described as follows: “the head of a
noun phrase is the one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity the
whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:33). So in an example such as (69), we might
say that shunñe ‘man’ is the semantic head, and matata ‘big’ refers to a property of
the man.
(69) matata shunñe
big
man
‘a/the big man’It can be said that the NP as a whole refers to a man, not to a big. In constructions
such as the following, however, it seems that typical noun candidates are in fact
not the semantic head:
(70) abchajmu shunñe
dog
man
‘male dog’ [MV‐32MA‐9]
dyolojoto shunñe
amardillo man
‘armadillo‐man’ 12 (AY‐2NC‐2)These are not morphological compounds, since each word carries its own primary
stress. Nevertheless, constructions such as the ones in (70) are rather marginal. In
the prototypical situation it is a property word that is in the modifying role.
The noun is not obligatory in the noun phrase, even though it is present in the
vast majority of cases. If the head noun is missing, we are dealing with elliptic
constructions in which it is clear from the context which object is referred to.

refers to a male person, who has shared characteristics with an armadillo.
13 The word maj~matata cannot be interpreted as a predicative complement of the verb ti‐
jusu, (‘I want it to be big’), since then it would have to be marked with the intentional
marker ‐ni and the subordinate marker =ti (cf. section 8.2.4)
1273A grammar of Yurakaréconversation has been plates. It is only in these circumstances, i.e. when the
referent is known from the context that we can have an adjective by itself in
argument position.
Other criteria to establish the head of the NP are not really useful for Yurakaré.
There is no clear agreement within the NP, while grammatical relations, number
and articles cliticize to the NP as a whole rather than to one of the words in it.
Functionally, some nouns can be used as adjectives, as is shown in example (70)
above. Other such nouns are pëpë (grandfather/old), tejte (grandmother/old) and
yee (woman). Nouns can also function as predicates, without any overt marking to
signal the change of category. I will come back to this when discussing verbs in
section 3.3.3 below.
Morphologically, nouns can be set apart on the basis that they are the only word
class that takes possessive marking in the form of personal prefixes, cf. (72)a or
predicative possession, by means of the prefix i‐, cf. (72)b:
(72) abti‐sibë
1SG‐house
‘my house’
atta=jsha
i‐tanti‐ø
other=ABL
VBL‐eye;face‐3
‘He had his face on the other side.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)However, some animals, i.e. pets cannot be possessed, they need a lexical
classifier:
(73) a

‘my chicken’Property words cannot take possessive prefixes:
(74) a *ti‐matata
b *i‐matata‘my big one’
‘He has a big one.’ (JMB‐PC)Action words normally cannot take possessive prefixes either, except for some
verbs. When they are marked with the possessive prefixes, these words refer to
the result of an action and are nominal:74Morphology(75) abcti‐dula
1SG‐do;make
‘my product’
ti‐nënë
1SG‐cook
‘my cooking’
ti‐sawata
1SG‐work
‘my work.’In conclusion, even though there is some spill‐over and the criteria have
exceptions, nouns can be characterized by the fact that they are the semantic head
of an NP, control the number behavior of the NP, and that they are by and large
the only word class that takes possessive morphology. Nouns, and
subclassifications of nouns will be discussed in more detail in section 4.4.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"97A grammar of Yurakaréthe Macro‐Quechuan network, including inter alia nearby languages such as
Quechua, Itonama, Mosetén, and Cayuvava. Greenberg (1960, 1987) and Key
(1979) classify Yurakaré as an equatorial language, in the Andean‐Equatorial
stock, along with, among others, Cayuvava, Arawak, and Tupi languages. Suárez
(1974) links Yurakaré to Mosetén (something which had been suggested by
Metraux in a personal comment to Mason 1950:275) and Chon languages, as well
as to Pano‐Tacanan in a stock he calls Macro‐Pano‐Tacanan.
All authors that have considered Yurakaré in their classification base their
proposals on La Cueva (1893), which is a rich source, but not rich enough to justify
these classifications (cf. Suárez 1974:137‐138). Secondly, the correspondences they
find are not overwhelming, as confirmed by Campbell (1997:192) and Adelaar
with Muysken (2004:27‐29). Using a word list with 133 items, Greenberg (1987)
only finds 22 correlates for Yurakaré, some of which are rather far off from their
cognate examples both formally and notionally. The highest number of lexical
correlations that Suárez (1974) finds for Yurakaré is with Tacana (14 out of 100 ‐ cf.
Suárez 1974:138). He also finds some systematic correspondences in the
pronominal system, some grammatical categories and phonology, but these are
sometimes due to errors in La Cueva’s grammar (e.g. causative ma‐, focus marker ‐
ya, negator chama).
In the light of these controversies, it is best to regard Yurakaré as an unclassified
language, for which convincing evidence has not (yet) been found to classify it
with (an)other language(s) in a larger group. Hopefully this grammar will
contribute to shed some more light on this issue.","[22, 23]"
"Propositional markersPalmer (2001:7‐8) distinguishes event modality from propositional modality, the
latter being concerned “with the speaker’s attitude to the truth value or factual
status of the proposition”. Event modality, in contrast, refers to “events that are
not actualized, events that have not taken place but are merely potential”. Event
modality has been discussed in section 6.3 above, the focus in this section will
therefore be on propositional modality (and aspect).
Yurakaré has a set of enclitics that encode distinctions at the propositional level.
These markers fall into two classes, on the basis of their placement in the sentence.
There is a set of propositional enclitics which mostly attach to the rightmost word
of a clause, regardless of the grammatical category of that word (clausal enclitics).
There is another set of propositional enclitics that attach to the main verb of a
clause (verbal enclitics). These latter markers are placed right after the subject
person markers in the verb complex, thus reflecting their scope:
(1)objects ‐ derivation ‐ root ‐ derivation ‐ TMA ‐ subject = propositional markersI consider these verbal enclitics to be enclitics because of their position within the
verb. They follow the plural marker =w of the third person plural subject. As
outlined in section 3.2.5, =w should be considered an enclitic, and therefore all the
morphosyntactic material that follows this element should be considered enclitics
as well, since affixes cannot attach to clitics (cf. Zwicky & Pullum 1983:503).
An overview of the two groups of enclitics is given in Table 42:

Yurakaré relate to aspect and modality. It is quite difficult to separate these two
functions, since enclitics with aspectual values can also have modal meanings and
vice versa. More generally, it is very difficult to determine the exact meaning of
the enclitics, since they can be used in so many different situations.
In this chapter I will describe each of the propositional enclitics in their own
right, as far as that is possible, since they often occur in combination with other231A grammar of Yurakarépropositional enclitics or with event‐related modal and aspectual markers. I will
first discuss the verbal enclitics (7.1), followed by an account of the clausal
propositional markers (7.2). In 7.3, finally, I will give an overview of the
combinatory possibilities.
This chapter is exploratory in character and should be seen as a first
approximation of the data. Many of the enclitics are difficult to interpret, since
they occur in many different situations. Further research is needed to achieve a
better understanding of these enclitics.","[246, 247]"
