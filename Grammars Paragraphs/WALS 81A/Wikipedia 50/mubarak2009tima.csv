"Tima expresses the passive morphologically by the suffix '-ɨk/-ɘk' on the
verbs. The passive suffix is affected by the root vowel harmony (see236Bashir forthcoming). The active word order of the sentence in Tima is:
SVO.
Therefore, in the passive construction, the subject is completely absent
(i.e. the subject deletion is obligatory), whereas the object of the active
voice is moved to the subject position and functions as a new subject in
the passive voice (DS = derived subject). Hence, the passive voice takes
the following word order:
DS + V
Thus, the passive in Tima is considered as a derivational process that
decreases the valency of the verb. In other words, the passive form, which
is intransitive, is derived from a transitive verb form. In this case, the
passive sentence consists of only one argument which is the derived
subject. The examples are:
(153) a. Active voice
kʊ-kwaakan-tɔm-aat̪aŋkɨ-mɨnʌNC:sg-chickenASP.3sg-kill-COMPNC:sg-snake'the chicken killed the snake'
b. Passive voice
kɨ-mɨnʌan-tɔm-t̪-ʊk-at̪aŋNC:sg-snakeASP.3sg-kill-?-PASS-COMP 26'the snake was killed'26The function of the element '-t-' in the passive construction is not clear; it needs more investigation.","[257, 258]"
"The subjunctive form in Tima is formed by the prefix 'i-' for the 1st person
plural inclusive on the verb. This subjunctive mood in Tima is also clear
in the negative subjunctive mood (see also 4.6). They express weak
obligations. It is highly productive and systematic. The examples are:

'let's bring s.th'b) ɪ-daa'let's run'c) ɪ-hʊdɔnɔ'let's sit down'd) ɪ-hɘlak'let's remain seated'The structure of the subjunctive forms can be represented by the
following formula.a) 1st pl incl:ɪ-stem
2084.4.3.3 Indicative mood
Indicative mood is used to assert a proposition as a fact. It is also referred
to as declarative mood (Whaley, 1997). The indicative mood in Tima is
morphologically unmarked. It constitutes the most basic sentence type.
Therefore, it is not marked for modality.
The indicative form in Tima is unmarked morphologically.The common
word order for indicative sentences is SVO as in (119). Tima has another
word order according to the focusing/topicalization on certain
constituents of a sentence. The other word orders are: OV(S) as in (120),
VSO or SOV (Dimmendaal, 2009) 16.

It is used to show the speaker's certainty about the occurrence of an
action. In Tima, the so-called certainty mood/form is marked by the
proclitic 'kV' which usually precedes the future marker 'dV-' in the
sentence. The full paradigm of certainty mood is shown in (121).
16The Tima word-orders need more investigation from a syntactic point of view.","[229, 230]"
"1554.3.2.1.1 The subject ergative enclitics markers
Tima has a set of subject pronominal markers in the ergative case (Set C).
They occur in transitive clauses when the object of the clause is in focus.
Hence, an additional morpheme '-N-' precedes the subject markers. In this
case a phonological process takes place as a result of the fusion between
the morpheme '-N-' and the initial consonant of the subject marker 'dV' in
the case of 1st person singular. The resultant form is 'na/nʌ' (e.g. –N-dV> -nV). The same process occurs with the 3rd person singular 'pɨnʌ'. It
fuses with the nasal morpheme '-N-'. Then the 3rd person becomes 'mɨnʌ'
in the ergative case. With regard to the form of the 2nd person
singular/plural and the 1st person pl (incl/excl) the subject markers remain
the same, because they already start with nasal consonants (see Table
4.3). See example (26) for ergative marker.
(26) iɽɨŋkɨk-emook-nʌtɛkbeer-FOCdrink-1sgAdv.before'I drank beer before'4.3.2.2 The object markers
The object pronominal markers occur after the verb root and before the
enclitic subject markers in a transitive clause. The object markers have
the same forms as the enclitic subject markers (Set B); the only way of
distinguishing between them depends on their order in the clause.
Example (27) shows the different enclitic object markers on the verb.","[176, 177]"
"Slot 7, 8 and 9 contain the various derivational suffixes which are found
in Tima. These slots are ordered with respect to their position relative to
the verb root. These numbers show the relation of these suffixes to the
root (see also Section 4.5). This means their occurrence is restricted with
regard to the verbal root, i.e. in a complex formation of these derivational146suffixes, DER 1, for instance, can not follow the suffix in DER 2; it
should precede DER 2. This is shown in example (9a and b).

1474.3 The Tima pronominal system
Pronouns in Tima are part of various paradigms: independent pronouns,
subject pronouns referred to here as subject markers (SM), object
pronouns (OM) and possessive pronouns (see 3.2.5.1). In this chapter, the
independent pronouns will be presented. The main focus here will be on
the description of subject and object pronominal markers which are
cliticized onto the verb, i.e. they are treated as part of the verb structure.
The subject pronouns are considered as proclitics and enclitics on the
verb and the object pronouns are considered as enclitics.","[167, 168, 169]"
"2.4.1 Verb structure
Usually, the verb consists of a number of morphemes which express
different grammatical categories plus the verb root. The output verb form
is referred to as a verb stem. For instance, the English verb 'look' is
considered as a verb root where the verb 'look' plus the '-ed' past marker
form the verb stem 'looked'. The order of morphemes in the verb differs
from one language to another. Some of them appear either as prefixes/
suffixes or as infixes. If one looks at Swahili verb structure (an SVO
language), different slots are occupied by different morphological
categories,forexample,subjectagreement-Tense/Aspect-(objectagreement)-verb root-(derivational suffixes)-mood vowel. Tima verb
structure is much more complicated than the Swahili verb structure. The
Tima verb, in its most complex form, contains more than ten slots
expressing different grammatical categories, such as the following:
(negative marker) - aspect marker - proclitic subject marker – tense - verb
root - (derivational suffixes) - (object marker) - enclitic subject marker (negative marker) (see 4.2 on the verb as a word structure). These various
slots on the verb express different types of inherent grammatical
categories associated with the verb such as subject/object marker (i.e.
person markers), TAM, derivational affixes. These grammatical35categories of the verb will be discussed below with reference to their
occurrence mainly in African languages.","[56, 57]"
"2.4.1.1 Pronominal markers
In African languages, the subject and object are normally expressed on
the verb by bound morphemes. The term 'pronominal markers' is used to
refer to subject/object distinctions. They are considered as an inherent
inflectional category of verb. By definition, the pronominal markers refer
to an entity of a noun phrase which is found elsewhere in the sentence
and they usually distinguish between subject/object from a syntactic point
of view.
According to Creissels et al. (2008), there are three subtypes of
pronominal markers which are considered as cliticization of free
pronouns. Type 1 pronominal markers are in complementary distribution
with the corresponding noun phrase. Type 2 pronominal markers are
obligatory even when the corresponding noun phrase is present in the
subject/object function. Type 3 pronominal markers are also obligatory,
but they can not appear without the corresponding noun phrases.
The pronominal markers in Tima fall under the second type, where the
existence of them is obligatory irrespective of the representation of the
corresponding noun phrases in the sentence. They are presented by both
proclitic markers fused with Tense/Aspect markers and by enclitics which
are attached to the verb at the same time in the case of subject (see 4.3.2).
There is frequently a problem in analyzing these pronominal markers in
African languages. They are analyzed as independent words, because
36they have forms which differ from those of independent pronouns in a
language. Now the pronominal markers have been identified correctly,
they frequently have turned out (in the majority of African languages) to
be bound subject and object markers.","[57, 58]"
"15mentioned phonological criteria may be quite different from one language
to another.
Besides the phonological criteria, there are grammatical criteria that help
in defining and identifying the word. One criterion is based on the idea of
permutation of elements with one another. This situation occurs in a free
word order language like Latin where the elements of a sentence can be
permuted without any change in meaning. Moreover, it is possible to
insert another word between two already existing words. But it is not
possible to insert a word between formatives/morphemes without
changing the meaning (Matthews, 1991).
Another grammatical approach to the definition of the word is based on
the different parts of speech of the word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
and the occurrence of the obligatory categories associated with each
class. Latin nouns, for example, are inflected for case and number, where
Latin verbs are obligatory inflected for tense, aspect and mood. These
grammatical categories help a lot in specifying the word and their class
(Anderson, 1985a).
It is found that there is sometimes a conflict among these different criteria
and one can not depend on one criterion irrespective of the others in order
to have a satisfactory definition of the word. Therefore, one must depend
in one’s definition of a word on all of the criteria together, in order to
have a comprehensive and clear picture of what the word meant. But the
most striking problem concerns the status of words as clitics.","[36, 37]"

non- back vowel, the subject proclitic marker is 'iŋ-', for example 'iŋ-kʌlʌʌk-dʌ yabuh', ' I ate meat'.","[190, 191]"
"2144.5.1.2 Pluractional formation in TimaFrom a typological point of view, pluractionality means plural action. It
may actually involve a combination of one of the following factors: (i)
one subject doing the action repeatedly to the same object, (ii) one subject
doing the action on several objects, (iii) several subject doing the action
on the same object (see section 2.4.1.5). Tima uses the idea of
pluractionality in order to distinguish the kind of action whether it is done
once or several times or whether it is done by singular/plural agents.
Tima has different strategies for expressing pluractionality; namely, as
follows:
(1) Pluractional formation by stem vowel change:
Tima expresses the pluractional meaning through the change of the stem
vowel if it is compared between the non-pluractional and pluractional
verb stem. The examples are:215(126)

(127a, b and c) or partial reduplication as in (127 d, e and f).","[235, 236, 237]"
"4.3.1 Free personal pronouns
Free pronouns represent a closed word class. According to language
typology, the pronouns usually substitute the noun or noun phrase in a
subject or object position. Dimmendaal (2004) has sorted out the
independent Tima personal pronouns as shown in table (4.2):
1sgkɨdʌ2sgŋaaŋ3sgpɨnʌ1pl inclɪnɛɛy1pl excliniin2plɪnaan3plihinʌTable (4.2): Tima Free personal pronouns
Table (4.2) shows that Tima does not have a gender distinction in the 3rd
person singular and plural. Tima on the other hand distinguishes between1481p (incl) and 1pl (excl). The free personal pronouns can be used in
isolation i.e. in a minimal NP. One example is:
(12) kɨdʌka-bandị1sgNC.sg-teacher' I am a teacher'In Tima the presence of these independent pronouns is optional, i.e. the
sentence can stand without them and their occurrence gives more
information on the subject/agent of the clause (as Creissels, 2000 has
characterized this phenomenon). At the same time, the presence of
dependent subject pronouns (pronominal subject markers) is obligatory
on the sentence (see 2.4.1.1). The sentences in (13) are examples:
(13)
1sg(kɨdʌ) cɛŋ-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-dʌ kʊkwan'I shut the door'2sg(ŋaaŋ) cɛŋ-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-ŋaŋ kʊkwan'you shut the door'3sg(pɨnʌ) ca-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-ø kʊkwan'he/she shut the door'1plincl(ɪnɛɛy)ce-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-nɛɛy kʊkwan'we shut the door'1plexcl (iniin) cɛ-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-niin kʊkwan'we shut the door'2pl(ɪnaan) ca-na-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-nan kʊkwan 'you shut the door'3pl(ihinʌ) ca-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-ø kʊkwan'they shut the door'It is found in the data that the independent personal pronouns are
inflected by different focus markers which appear in combination with
them (Dimmendaal, 2009), the examples of personal pronouns with
enclitic focus markers are as follows:

Creissels et al (2008: 92) mentioned that a ""pronominal marker is applied
to any bound morpheme referring to an entity that is represented
elsewhere in the same clause by a noun phrase"". Thus, the pronominal
markers function in subject and object positions and they are considered
as bound morphemes. Sometimes, they are referred to as 'pronominal
reference marking on verbs' (Spencer, 1998).
Tima subject and object pronominal markers are obligatory in a clause
even if a noun phrase or a free personal pronoun occurrs in a clause (see
Section 2.4.1.1 for the different stages of pronominal marking).","[169, 170, 171]"
"The above rule can be read as followingː the Tima noun phrase consists
of an obligatory noun head followed by a number of optional modifiers.
The modifiers occur in the following order: demonstrative, adj (age, size,
color, value), and number/quantifier. The optional modifiers are put in
parenthesis. The slash (/) between the numerals and quantifier indicates135that these two constituents can not co-occur in a single phrase. Both of
these modifiers indicate more than one, i.e. they are in complementary
distribution. It is also noticed that there is free occurrence of adjective of
value and the quantifiers in terms of order, see example (c) in table (3.4)
and example (124) below. Both of the two examples are grammatically
correct.
(124) i-rtu
Nc.Pl-housei-hatami-malPl-manyPl-nice'many nice houses'The examples in table (3.4) show that there is an agreement in number
between the head noun and other constituents in a noun phrase such as:
adjectives; numerals quantifiers. Note, however, that demonstratives
(unless they are used elliptically) and possessive pronouns do not agree in
number with the nouns they modify. See table (3.5) below.

The next chapter (Chapter 4) will deal with the verbal morphology of
Tima with all the inherent grammatical categories that are usually
associated in describing the verbal morphology in a specific language.","[156, 157]"
"4.1.3 Reduplicated verbs
Tima has another class of verbs involving reduplicated verb roots. This
class of verbs displays a category of full reduplicated verbs, where no
traces of partially reduplicated verbs are found in the data unless the
reduplication has a morphological function, indicating pluractionality (see
4.5.1.2). The reduplicated verbs here do not convey any grammatical
function. The examples of reduplicated verbs are shown below.
(1)
-munmun-'smile'-dumdum-'detain'-muɽ(u)muɽ-'asking God'-bʊlbʊl-'roll'4.1.4 Compound verbs
In addition to the canonical shape of verb roots which is used in order to
classify verbs, Tima has a class of verbs which is classified according to140their structural elements or components. That is, compound verbs are
formed by combining the verb as a head of the verb phrase (VP) plus a
noun which syntactically functions as object. The verbs in this class can
not stand by themselves, i.e. without such combinations with nominal
complements. The examples are:
(2)
a) ʊ-hɔɔʌɽuuɽukASP.3plhitshoutings'they shouted (lit. they hit the shouting)' (the story of horse quarrel)b) y-ʌhunen
NC.pl-womant̪ɪh-ɪø-ɪdɪdɪpull out-TrNC.pl-yululate'the women produced the ululate (lit. the women pulled out the ululate)'
(the story of horse quarrel)4.1.5 Inflected verbs
Tima has a special class of verbs that are inflected for person. They have
an object semantically performing the role of recipient. By comparison,
the basic form of the verb (root) has its own meaning which differs when
it is associated with a pronoun. Consequently, the complex verb has a
new meaning. For examples:
(3)
Inflected verb
a) ayi-yaŋ 'visit (him/them)'The basic verb form
ay-ɪ
'go'b) kʊnɛ-tʌŋ 'help (him/them)'kʊnɛ'prevent'c) ahɪyʌŋahɪ'give''give him'1414.2 The verb as a word category
The term verb structure, sometimes referred to as 'verb group', indicates
that the verb consists of verb root plus different affixes (prefixes or
suffixes). The resulting form is referred to as 'verb stem'. The affixes
which appear on the verb are classified as either inflectional or
derivational morphemes. Their order with regard to the root differs from
one language to another. For instance, Swahili verb-structure consists of
up to ten different affixes (Lindfors, 2003). Tima verb structure is more
complicated than the Swahili verb-structure. The Tima verb form consists
of at least 12 elements. Table (4.1) illustrates the order of the different
affixes and clitical elements. Following the table is a description of the
different slots (along with examples). Parentheses in this table indicate
that the item is not obligatory.","[161, 162, 163]"
"1343.2.6 NP's constituents order
As mentioned above, the Tima NP consists of different kind of modifiers
that occur with the noun. The modifiers differ in their order within a noun
phrase. See table (3.4) below.","[155, 156]"
"2.4.2 Head-marking language
Having completed discussing the most important inflectional categories
(pronominal markers, TAM, negation) and derivational categories on
verbs (DAs and pluractional), we are now in a position to classify a
43language like Tima on the base of this information. A language which has
such a rich inflection and derivation system is classified as a headmarking language versus a dependent-marking language like Ghulfan, a
Nubian language spoken north of Tima. In a head-marking language the
verb as the head of the clause/sentence carries all the information with
regard to person markers, TAM, and derivational operations expressing
the different semantic roles involved in the structure of the verb. On the
other hand, dependent-marking languages usually makes distinction
between subject and object (i.e. the syntactic function of a noun) by way
of morphological case markers on nouns (e.g. nominative-accusative
case, as in Latin (Corbett, 1998) or the Nubian language Ghulfan for that
matter.
This type of head-marking language is exactly observed in a number of
Nilo-Saharan languages with a verb-initial syntax as well as a verb- final
syntax, for example in Nilotic and Surmic languages (Dimmendaal,
2000). In addition, a number of SVO languages in Niger-Congo family
are classified as head-marking languages. Dependent-marking languages
are less common in the Nuba Mountains, but may be found among NiloSaharan languages (e.g. Nubian) and in some of the central Chadic
languages (e.g Berber, Omotic, Cushitic and Ethio-Semitic languages
(Creissels et al, 2008).
Accordingly, Tima is considered as a head-marking language. The
complex form of the verb with its various slots carries all the information
required with regard to the number of arguments in a sentence and other
valency operations mentioned above. Therefore, the Tima verb can be
treated as forming a complete clause/sentence without any need for other
sentence's constituents to be mentioned (see 4.2).
44It has been argued that Tima has a very complicated system with regard
to its verb constructions. This is clear from the large number of slots
which are occupied in forming the verb as a word category.
The next chapter will consider the noun and its modifiers which are found
in Tima as a starting point of analyzing.","[64, 65, 66]"
"313The Tima pronominal system played a great role in the formation of the
verbal word. That is, the pronominal person markers (subject and/or
object) were obligatory on the verb, and without them the meaning of the
verb is incomplete (i.e. according to the syntactic function of the
participants).
The pronominal person markers usually fuse with the markers that
distinguish tense, aspect and mood and they form together a
portemanteau morpheme. Therefore, a separate section has been added in
order to discuss this phenomenon in the language. Tima has a binary
tense system, i.e. it has a two-way distinction, between future and nonfuture. Tima relies heavily on the aspect distinction, i.e. on the
perfectivity and imperfectivity of an action or event. This aspect in Tima
is morphologically marked by different morphemes (e.g. progressive,
habitual, iterative, etc.). With regard to mood, Tima has a number of
different mood types such as imperative, hortative, subjunctive, indicative
and veridical mood. Most of them are marked morphologically.
The verb extensions, as one of the prominent features of Niger-Congo
languages, were discussed elaborately for Tima. The description focused
on the derivational processes that derive verbs out of other verbs. This is
done through a number of different affixes (suffixes) on the verb in
addition to pluractional marking which is marked by different strategies
in the language, including vertical (non-concatenative) morphology.
The chapter concluded by presenting the two different strategies of verbal
negation: (i) with the negative proclitic 'kV-' and the negative enclitic'Vŋ'
and (ii) with the negative expression 'amaŋ'. It is found that Tima has a314common strategy of negating declarative sentences, which is the first one
mentioned above. Moreover, the form of negated sentences depends on
the aspect distinction, e.g. whether it is perfective or imperfective. In the
latter, the negation-marking expression 'amaŋ' is used.
Chapter five covered all the different types of nominal derivation. It is
divided into two main parts. The first part showed how nouns are derived
mainly from verbs and adjectives, besides the diminutive, reduplicated
and ideophonic nouns which do not derive from verbs. It has covered,
first, the structure of verbal nouns and how they differ in their structure
from the common nouns found in Tima. They were classified into
different classes according to their endings. In addition, the different
functions of the verbal nouns were illustrated.
The agentive nouns were included, whereby different types have been
used in order to express the concept of someone who does an action. It
was found that they are formed in most cases by a combination of a
verbal noun and bound elements. In other cases, they are formed
independently from the bound elements.
Abstract nouns were also shown in this chapter. They divided into two
types. The first type included nouns which are derived from verb roots.
They are formed by the processes of prefixation and suffixation. The
second type was derived from adjectives by a process of prefixation. In
addition, other types of nominalized nouns were diminutive, reduplicated
and ideophonic nouns have been presented.
The second part of the chapter has covered the compounding of nouns as
another process of noun formation. Different types of compounds were315found in Tima, such as endocentric, exocentric and co-ordinate
compounds. Each one was dealt with in isolation in order to present its
common structure and the way it behaved in the language.
There are still several areas which have not been covered yet. Therefore,
the study demands further investigation, especially with regard to the
Tima verbal system.","[334, 335, 336, 337]"

References …………………………………………………………317VIIIAbstractThis study tries to describe and analyze the structure of the word in Tima
(a Kordofanian language), mainly the structure of the noun and the verb.
Its aim is to fulfill the following two objectives: first, to provide a
comprehensive description of unwritten language. Secondly, to document
Tima as one of the endangered languages in Sudan.
The Linguistic data was collected during formal sessions with two native
speakers, in addition to irregular meetings with the Tima language
committee members in Al Dorushab (North Khartoum). Between 22-30
February 2007, the researcher visited the Tima area in the Nuba
Mountains, where a considerable amount of data was collected.
The study used different techniques for the data collections: elicitation of
word-lists, elicitation of grammatical sentences and a large number of
narratives and procedural texts were recorded and transcribes.
Finally, the study achieved the description of word-structure in Tima with
regard to the different parts of speech that are found in the language. The
main inherent grammatical categories that distinguish each part of speech
were classified and analyzed.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"19Therefore, languages usually use such types of morphological processes
in order to express different morphological functions, such as number,
case, polarity, etc. For instance, Asheron (a Niger-Kordofanian language)
uses the prefixes for number marking on nouns, in addition to other
prefixes which are attached to the adjectives in order to show agreement
between the noun and the adjective in a noun phrase (Alamin, 2003).
Similarly, the words in Tima are built up by a large number of affixes.
For example, Tima has a number of noun-class prefixes which attach to
the root in order to distinguish between singular and plural nouns (e.g. the
'kV-' classes for singular and the prefix 'i-' and its allomorphs for plural
nouns) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.1). Moreover, Tima makes heavy use of
suffixes which show different functions, especially with regard to the
verb extensions (verbal derivations), such as suffixes that are used to
derive a causative verb from other verb (e.g. –ik) (see 4.5.1.3), the
transitive suffix '-i' (see 4.5.1.1), the instrumental suffix '-aa' (see
4.5.1.4), ventive suffix '-Vŋ' (see 4.5.2.4), etc.","[40, 41]"
"In particular, Tima is considered as a poorly known language due to the
few linguistic researches that have been carried out in order to describe
and document it. In fact, there were no specific linguistic studies devoted
to the investigation of Tima. Therefore, the earliest studies on Tima are
fairly limited. It was first mentioned by Meinhof (1916-17), whose
attempt was to study Katla, but for comparative reasons he also collected8little material on Tima. MacDiarmid and MacDiarmid (1931) recorded a
short word-list and some sentences from both Katla and Tima.","[29, 30]"
"102(75) ibʌ wajɛnkɔ-kwɔlɔŋ'father's brother's childern'Having finished presenting and analyzing all the Tima noun classes and
kinship terms, we now turn to a presentation of nominal modifiers that
associate with the noun in order to form noun phrases (NPs).
3.2 Nominal modifiers
Tima has different types of nominal modifiers, such as adjectives (3.2.1),
numerals (3.2.2), non-numerals quantifiers (3.2.3), demonstratives
(3.2.4), pronominal and nominal possessive construction (3.2.5). All of
these modifiers follow the head noun which they modify. Therefore,
Tima can be classified as a head-initial language. The following sections
will describe the structure and function of each category and their relation
to the head noun in the NP.
3.2.1 Adjectives
The traditional definition of adjectives identifies them as the class of
words denoting qualities or attributes. Some languages have an open class
of adjectives as the case in English and German, whereas others have a
close class of adjectives as the case in Igbo (Kwa, Niger-Congo, Nigeria)
which has only eight. Other languages lack a distinct class of adjectives
altogether (Schachter, 1985).
In his survey of 17 languages, Dixon (1982) observed that the semantic
types which are mostly associated with adjectives are: dimension, age,103value, and human prosperity. Accordingly, Tima has an open class of
adjectives. The Tima adjectives are not obviously derived from a word of
any other category, see the examples throughout this section.
3.2.1.1 Canonical shape of adjectives
The majority of Tima adjectival roots have initial consonants. The
adjective roots are considered as bound roots. They can not stand alone in
order to give a full meaning. They must be preceded by one of the
prefixes which are determined according to the function of adjectives
(3.2.1.2).","[123, 124, 125]"
"2.4.1.5 Pluractional
In the preceding paragraphs the different types of DAs have been
presented. Pluractional marking is also considered as part of the
derivational operations taking place on the verb. But because of its weight
on the verbal morphology of African languages, separate paragraphs are
devoted to introduce and explain this phenomenon. Pluractional is
sometimes referred to as 'number in verb' (Bybee, 1985), 'verbal number'
(Creissels, 2008), or 'plural verb/iterative' (Abu Manga, 1986). It is well
known that nouns/nominals are inflected for number either as singular or
as plural. But there are some languages in which number distinctions are
expressed on the verb.
Pluractional marking usually involves the multiplicity of subjects, objects
or the repetitition of an action itself (Williamson and Blench 2000). For
42this aspect of plurality marking on verbs the term “pluractional” is coined
by Newman (1990) in his study of Chadic verbs (e.g. Kanakuru
language). Such phenomena are also widespread in Niger-Congo
languages. Aaron (1994) has studied verbal number in Obolo (BenueCongo language). He states that languages in general follow different
processes for expressing pluractionals on verbs. Examples of these
processes are: by way of affixes that are attached to the verb root, full or
partial reduplication of the verb root/stem, internal change of the verb
stem, or by using supletive verb forms to indicate plurality. The last
process, i.e. suppletive form is described by Bybee (1985) in her survey
of some languages of the world. She found that in Kung, a language of
southern Africa, there are two forms of verbs. One form is used when the
subject/object is singular and the other form is used when the
subject/object of a sentence is plural.
Likewise, pluractional marking is considered as a prominent feature of
Tima verbal morphology. It uses the same processes mentioned above for
expressing plurals in verbs (see 4.5.1.2). One of the most important facts
is the fact that plurality in Tima does not play only a role on the verb
derivational morphology but is also considered as a major feature in
distinguishing imperfective from perfective aspect. This is due to the fact
that verbal plurality has an inherent meaning of the verb (see 4.4.2.3 on
perfective vs. imperfective).","[63, 64]"

c-ɪt̪ɪa-rdiNC.sg-clothSTAT.sg-red'the cloth is red'On the other hand, the verbs in Tima usually marked by the stative aspect
marker 'a-/ɪ-' express the perfectivity of an action/event. In this case, the
stative marker precedes the verb root plus the pronominal marker
(subject). An example is:

This section will shed light on the different types of moods (see 2.4.1.2
on mood types) found in Tima. The imperative form will be described in
4.4.3.1. The subjunctive form will be shown in 4.4.3.2. The indicative
will be presented in 4.4.3.3 with regard to the word order in Tima
sentences. Section 4.4.3.4 will briefly show how the interrogative is
formed in Tima. Negation will be discussed separately in section (4.6).","[225, 226]"
"Type 1: Compounds with 'arɔŋ'Compounds can also be formed by a bound word 'arɔŋ', which means
'one who likes'. The word 'arɔŋ' must attach to a noun in order to give a
full meaning. Thus, the result is agentive noun, as can be seen in (65) (see
5.1.2). It always carries a negative connotation.

c) arɔŋ kwaal'dancer (lit. one who likes dancing)'Type 2: Compounds with 'kimin'Tima has a number of compound nouns that are formed by the bound
element 'kimin' which is used in the language to indicate diminutive (see3075.1.4). It is also found that the diminutive can be associated with other
noun in order to derive a new meaning. The examples are:

It precedes the noun and it can not stand by itself; i.e. it can not be used in
isolation but it should be attached to a noun and in such a combination the
bound word 'yan' means 'things'. The bound word 'yan' is usually used in
its collective form.

"The study uses different techniques in collecting primary data: firstly, a
collection of word-lists. This word-list is recorded and transferred into
Audiofiles 3 . This helps considerable when trying to listen to the proper
pronunciation of words and sorting out the different noun-class prefixes
found in Tima. The second technique for collecting the data is elicitation.
It mainly helps in describing the various morphological features and the
grammar of a language. The elicitation is done with native speakers by
using both English and Arabic in order to avoid misunderstanding of
sentences. Thirdly, a number of texts were collected and subsequently
written by using the Transcriber program. The stories include stories,
songs and procedural texts. These texts help a lot in identifying the
different types of word classes and sentence structure. In addition, they
support the description and analysis of the most problematic phenomena
found in Tima, such as tense and aspect.",[31]
"Tima does not use the reduplication of nouns in order to show the
encoding of morphological distinctions. Other African languages
sometimes seem to use the reduplication of nouns as a productive process
of word formation or inflection, For example, Nyimang ( a Nilo-Saharan
language) uses this process to indicate a plurality of nouns or the
collective of whole (Stevenson, 1956) 5 . Tima does not have this
characteristic of reduplication, at least with respect to the noun.
Reduplication with verb roots is used in order to express repetition of an
action (compare Section 4.5.1.2). The reduplication with nouns occurs in
both singular and plural forms. In this case, two processes of wordformation accompany the formation of reduplicated nouns: back
formation and haplology (see 2.2.1.3).",[316]
"2.2.1.4 Compounding
Compounding is another morphological process shared in the formation
of word structure. Spencer (1991: 309) defined compounding as
""prototypically the concatenation of words to form other words"". A
compound form consists of two/more members of (potentially) open
lexical class. For instance, English allows several types of combinations
of different word-classes (N+N, A+N, V+N, N+V, N+A, A+A, etc.).
Usually, the two items that are brought together in a compound also24appear as independent words in a language on the one hand (e.g.
blackboard). On the other hand, one of the compound elements can
appear as an independent word (e.g. strawberry). Sometimes, both
members of compound are elements that only occur together (e.g.
mushroom) (Fabb, 1998).
According to the structure of compounding, there are various types of
compounding that are widespread across languages. The commonest
types of compounding are: endocentric, exocentric, and appositional/coordinate compounds (for definition see 5.2).
There is a difficulty encountered in various languages when trying to
distinguish between compounds and phrases (especially NP). Fabb (1998)
mentioned that compounds resemble phrasal combination in some ways 6 .
To avoid such resemblance between the two categories a number of
criteria are stated in order to distinguish between them. Firstly, the
phonological criteria sometimes help in that. The suprasegmental
processes, for instance the stress patterns, which are restricted to the
compounds, may differ from those restricted to the phrases (e.g. English,
'the white house').
Secondly, some languages may mark the compounds morphologically.
That is, a morpheme may be inserted between the two words, found only
in compounds, and it considered as a special empty suffix semantically
(e.g. the morpheme 's' in German, 'Volk-s-wagen', 'lit. people's car').","[45, 46]"

verbal noun suffix '-Vl', when the verbal nouns derive from a verb root
which ends with a vowel; i.e. it occurs intervocalically. These glides are
called epenthetic glides. The choice of the glide, either 'w' or 'y', should
be harmonized with the verb root/stem vowel; i.e. if the verb root
contains a back rounded vowel, the glide 'w' should be inserted in order to
avoid the combination of vowel sequences. The glide 'y' is inserted when
the verb root consists of a front/central vowel (Bashir forthcoming).

Tima verbal nouns can fulfill certain functions: Verbal nouns can occur in
subject position, as in (27a and b), they can occur in object position, as in
(27c and d); they can also take other modifiers that come with common
nouns, e.g. VN with possessive pronouns, as in (27e) or the VN functions
as a head noun in an NP construction as shown in example (27f) below.

marker 'i-' is written between two brackets to show that its appearance is optional or it depends on the
speaker's age (see 3.2.5.2 on nominal possessive).","[300, 301]"
"392.4.1.3 Negation
Sometimes, negation is considered as a mood type in contrast with
imperative and interrogative sentence type. But here the negation is taken
as a verbal inflection which modifies the verb and the verb phrase. This
leads us to distinguish between two types and strategies of sentence
negation as found in African languages. The first type is an internal
negation of the verb word which is common in African languages. This
usually involves affixes either before or after the verb word. An example
of this strategy is found in Aghem, a Benue-Congo (Niger-Congo)
language (Anderson, 1979), and in Labala, a Bantu (Niger-Congo)
language (David Morgan, p.c.). The second type is an external negation
of the verb word. That is, negative particles occur in clause-final position
and it negates the whole clause or sentence. In the case of transitive
verbs, the negative particle occurs after the object. This type is found in
Chadic languages in Nigeria and Cameroon (Creissels, 2008).
Tima has two obligatory negative particles that appear in a negative
sentence: The negative proclitic marker 'kV-' and the negative enclitic
marker '-Vŋ'. In this respect, Tima resembles Hausa, a Chadic language
(Kraft and Kraft, 1973) and Gur (Niger- Congo) languages (Watters,
2000) in using double negative particles which are external to the verb
word. Consequently, Tima in most cases displays the following negative
pattern: (S) NEG-SM-V root-(O)-NEG (see 4.6).","[60, 61]"
"311General Summary
This study is divided into five chapters. The following part gives a
summary of what has been described in each chapter.
Chapter one was an introductory notes which gave a brief background on
the classification of the language and the Tima community. The reasons
behind the complex linguistic situation in the Tima area were considered
with reference to the general linguistic situation in Sudan. In addition, the
chapter included some notes about the previous studies that have been
done in the Nuba Mountains; The methods of collecting the data were
illustrated, the way of presenting the data through out this study was
stated.
Chapter two has covered all the necessary information that is required in
discussing the word structure of a language like Tima. It described first
how the word is defined from a linguistic point of view (2.1.1); in
addition, the most important operations (2.2.1) that build up the words in
languages have been discussed with examples from other languages and
with reference to the Tima language as well. Sections (2.3) and (2.4)
handled the two major categories found in this language: the noun and the
verb. The major inherent grammatical categories associated with each
class have been described and discussed elaborately. The final output of
the verbal categories reveals that one can classify the language according
to the way syntactic and semantic relations are expressed; this
information may be expressed mainly on the verb, in which we are
dealing with a head-marking language at the clausal level, or,
alternatively, on noun phrases expressing different semantic roles, in
which we are dealing with a dependent-marking language (2.4.2).
312Chapter three was divided into two main sections. Section 3.1 discussed
the concept of noun classes in Tima. All productive and unproductive
noun classes of Tima have been analyzed. The number marking system
(the formation of singular and plural) of these classes has also been
illustrated. In addition, the forms of kinship terms (3.1.9) have been
presented and the way they mark the plural counterparts has been
discussed.
Section (3.2) described all the nominal modifiers as found in Tima. Their
position relative to the head noun which they modify has been shown, in
addition to their behavior with regard to the number of noun they modify.
Finally, a brief description of the NPs in Tima has been presented and the
final formula of all modifiers which are associated with nouns has been
stated.
Chapter four described, illustrated and analyzed all the morphological and
morphosyntactic features which are found in Tima so far. The chapter
starts by presenting the structure of Tima verbs. It was found that most of
the verbs are monosyllabic, in addition to a less numerous group of
disyllabic verb root. Trisyllabic verb roots are rare. In addition, the
structure of Tima verb stems has been presented, which contains, in
addition to the verbal root, other affixes or clitics. The presence of these
affixes or clitics on the verb forms the complex structure of the Tima
verbs. The stem/verb-word consisted of 12 slots, all together forming the
verb as a phonological and grammatical word. This complexity of verbs
has enabled us to classify the Tima as a typically head-marking language
at the clause level.","[332, 333, 334]"

The causative derivation is a process of increasing the number of
obligatory participants from one to two or from two to three by
introducing an agent participant to verb forms. That is, an existing subject
is changed into an object and at the same time an agent is added (Talmy,
1985). This process is found all over Africa (e.g. in Fulfulde, cf. Abu
Manga, 1986, or in Anywa, cf. Reh, 1996).
In Tima, the causative construction is marked morphologically. The
causative verbs are formed by adding the suffix '-ɪk/-ik' to the verb root.
The suffix vowel harmonizes with the root vowel. The suffix '-ik' occurs
with both intransitive verbs as the examples in (133), and transitive verb
stems, as shown in examples (134). The causative form '-ik' usually
appears with the transitive marker 'ɪ-/-i'. The combination of the suffix 'ɪ/-i' plus the causative marker '-ik' yields the form '-ɪɪk/-iik'. With
transitive verbs, the morphological boundaries should be drawn in order
to separate the two morphemes from each other as in the examples below.
220Therefore, the causative suffix '-ik' is considered as an operation of
increasing valency i.e. it increases the number of arguments in a clause.
The causative suffix '-ik' occurs in P2 in Table (4.5) and it has the
canonical shape of 'VC'.

something'wudʌ'burn'Tima has a number of verbs that have inherently the sense of
causativization. In this case, the way of deriving the causative verbs from
verb roots is done by changing the vowel of the verb stem, as in (135a).
There is a regressive assimilation whereby the vowel of the suffix
assimilates to the verb final vowel. The other examples in (135) have
inherently the meaning of causativization.
Notice that the verb root is 'ii', 'dress on' attaches to the causative suffix '-ik' in order to derive a new
meaning e.g.' ii-ik' which means 'cause someone put on the dress on somebody else'. But the correct
derived form is 'iik'. Accually, there is a deletion of the suffix vowel 'i' because the language does not
allow sequence of three vowels of the same quality, i.e. the vowel of the root and the suffix vowel.

appears on verbal nouns. Also, the noun in (48b) seems to behave like
verbal nouns and abstract nouns, respectively. The suffix '-ɛ' is actually a
combination of a transitive marker '–i' and the stative marker '-a'.(48)

Reduplications of forms are common in Tima. Such words can be fully or
partially reduplicated (see 2.2.1.3). This process is found with all classes
of words, such as nouns, verbs (4.1.3), and adjectives (3.2.1). The focus
here will be on reduplicated nouns.","[314, 315, 316]"
"262Chapter Five
Nominalization and Compounding
5.0 Introduction
According to Comrie (1985) the term nominalization (also referred to as
nominal derivation) means the ability to change something into a noun.
That is, the noun can be derived from other word classes such as verbs,
and/or adjectives, etc by use of derivational morphology. The
nominalization process is common in nearly all of the African phyla (e.g.
in Ewe, a Niger-Congo language (Heine and Leyew, 2008), and in
Toposa, an Eastern Nilotic language (Kadanya, 2006)).
This nominalization occurs through a number of different derivational
processes. On the one hand, a language can derive a noun out of verb by
adding different affixes. For instance, Laggori, a Nilo-Saharan language,
derives a noun out of verbs by different suffixes to the verb (e.g. the verb
'si', 'eat' is changed into the noun 'si-y-at', 'eating/food') (Alamin
Forthcoming). On the other hand, a language can use another device for
forming a noun. The noun is formed by means of reversing the order of
the verb and the object. This device is found in Gware, a Kwa language
of Nigeria (Creissels et al, 2008).
This chapter is restricted to nominalization in Tima. It is divided into two
main parts which will describe all the types of derived nouns found in the
language. The first part concentrates on the nominalized forms that are
found in Tima, such as verbal nouns (5.1.1), agentive nouns (5.1.2), and
abstract nouns (5.1.3), including adjectival nouns. Other types of nominal
263derivational forms will be presented in this section as well. These are
diminutive nouns (5.1.4), reduplicated nouns (5.1.5) and ideophonic
nouns (5.1.6). The second part (5.2) focuses mainly on the nature of
compound nouns and the different types of compounding that are found
in Tima, such as endocentric, exocentric and coordinate compounding.","[283, 284, 285]"
"2254.5.1.5.1 Benefactive
Beneficiary is another kind of applicative which increases the valency of
the verb. According to Payne (1991) the term means that an action is
done for the benefit of other person. Therefore, in most cases a clause
consists of two objects: a direct object and an indirect object. The
benefactive meaning in Tima is expressed morphologically by the clitic 'ii' which is attached directly to verb roots in order to introduce a new NP.
It is very productive. The benefactive marker '-ii' occurs in P3 in Table
4.5 on page (250). It has the canonical shape of 'VV'. Example (135)
shows a full paradigm with a benefactive clitic '-ii' plus personal object
pronouns 23. It will be glossed as applicative (APPL) below.

the verb with the benefactive marker:The same benefactive suffix '-ii' is attached to proper nouns (especially personal names). It is
considered as an inflected proclitic markers of nouns.","[246, 247]"
"4.4.2.3 The perfective vs. imperfective aspect
Comrie (1976: 16) points out that ""perfectivity indicates the view of a
situation as a single whole, while imperfectivity pays essential attention
to the internal structure of the situation"". In Tima, the perfective and
imperfective aspects are closely related to the concept of telicity.
Consequently, verbs can be classified into a number of classes according
to the aspectual and semantic properties of the verb itself; i.e. verbs are
classified according to the concept of telicity. That is, the verb can
inherently be a telic or an atelic verb (see below). These verbs are
characterized as one of the semantic aspectual properties of the situation
or speech event.
Perfectivity indicates completed action with a beginning, middle and end.
In general the perfective aspect in Tima is marked morphologically by a181suffix '-ataŋ' on verbs 9. This suffix indicates both the perfectivity and
completion of an action, especially when it is clearly contrasted with an
imperfective form; see the examples below.

usually disappears in casual speech, see example (65).

PAST-break-Comp-1sgc-ʊraŋkulʌʌNC.sg-stickAdv: yesterday'I broke the stick yesterday'9The suffix 'ataŋ' has a number of different functions in Tima language (see the suffix 'ataŋ' on averb). The suffix 'ataŋ' also appears in the imperative forms. In this case it means that an addressee
should complete doing an action/command.
mɔɔk-ataŋ
ɪhɪ
'drink the milk (completely)'/'drink up the milk'1824.4.2.4 Telic/atelic verbs
The word telic originates from the Greek word 'telos' which means 'end'.
Telic verbs refer to situations which have a terminal point; i.e. the
situation has a definite end. The term telic situation corresponds to the
term 'accomplishment'; atelic verbs refer to the situations that can be
protracted indefinitely or be broken off (Lehmann, 1991).
In his book on aspect, Comrie (1976) mentioned that the distinction
between telic and atelic verbs does not involve the verb only but it also
refers to the verb together with its arguments (subject and object). This
situation also holds true for Tima, where the telicity of verbs depends
heavily on the number of arguments as well as semantic and pragmatic
properties associated with the object of a sentence. The verb in Tima can
be described as a telic verb if the object is singular, whereas the same
verb can be described as atelic and has a different form if the object is
plural; i.e. it refers to more than one entity. This usually invovles the
concept of pluractionality in Tima.

verbs. The following paragraphs will present and describe these classes of
verbs.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"4.5.1 Operations of increasing valency4.5.1.1 Transitive suffixes
According to Payne (1997), a language can classify verbs according to
their transitivity, i.e. either transitive verbs which take an object as an
obligatory constituent, intransitive verbs which do not take an object,
ditransitive verbs which take two objects (direct and indirect object) or
ambitransitive verbs which can be constructed with or without the object.
The same is true of Tima. The transitive verbs are morphologically
marked by suffixes. They are obligatory on the verbs and the verbal
meaning can not be expressed without them. The transitive suffixes differ
according to their frequency in the language and the degree of their
transitivity (either present as highly transitive markers or low transitive
markers).",[233]
"2.1 The study of word structure
The study of word structure is considered nowadays as one of the most
important and interesting aspects of linguistics especially with regard to
the grammatical description of unknown and unwritten languages.
Therefore, the study of word structure is treated as a starting point in any
phonological, syntactic and semantic analysis of a specific language.
The study of word structure is defined by Anderson (1985b) as the study
of the internal structure of words and the relationship between the parts
that form the word. In a simple way, Katamba (1993) defines the study of
word structure as the study of word shape. Actually, words are built up of
a number of smaller pieces that are called formatives 1 (see 2.1.2). These
definitions of the study of word structure bring up the problem of

formation'. In traditional grammar the term 'morphemes' are used instead of formatives.",[35]
"41participants that the verb takes (e.g. causative, benefactive, dative,
instrumental) and decreasing valency, i.e. decreasing the number of
arguments/participants in the clause (e.g. passive, antipassive, reciprocal,
reflexive, and directional: oriented goal / towards or from speaker).
According to Whaley (1997) the verb's valence is not fixed. Therefore, it
can be manipulated in a number of ways, for example by way of
morphology, word order or by other devices.
The derivational suffixes (DSs) in Tima which function as increasing or
decreasing valency devices of the verb often occur in a variety of
different positions/slots with respect to the verb root. Moreover, together
they may form complex derivational suffixes when occurring in a
sequence (see 4.5.3).","[62, 63]"
"The word orderconcerning this type of passive is SVO.
There is no independent subject (or nominal subject). The subject appears
as part of the verbal word. It is represented by one of the pronominal
subject markers (see 4.3.2.1) on the verb. The Tima example is:

associated with other verbal nouns in order to describe a person's quality.

adjective in a predicate position in order to describe a person's quality.
The examples are:
(31) k-ah
NC.sg-heada- dɪʔʔɪl
STAT-clean'cleaver person (lit. the head is clean)'Type 2: Agentive nouns with 'arɔŋ'The agentive nouns found in this class are formed by the bound word
'arɔŋ' which means 'like' plus the verbal nouns. This combination of
agentive nouns is formed by a kind of adjectival compound clause which
means 'who/which likes something (see 5.2 on compounding). The word
'arɔŋ' is considered as a bound morpheme because it has no meaning
when it occurs in isolation and it is not found in any other construction in
Tima. This means it is exclusively used with verbal nouns to derive
agentive nouns. Thus, the new compound nouns describe a person who
does an action unintentionally. This means that one can do/perform the
action as a habit. The others describe that person on that ground, but the
meaning usually conveys a negative connotation. The examples are:284(32)
AVglossa) arɔŋ kapalɛɛl'lover'b) arɔŋ t̪ʊrɪ'miser'c) arɔŋ t̪amaa'talkative'd) arɔŋ kwɔɔ'one who likes walking'Type 3: Agentive nouns that describe professionsThe agentive nouns found in this class are formed by neither 'kay' nor
'arɔŋ'. But some of them are nevertheless derived from verb roots. They
actually resemble the verbal nouns in their forms. Agentive nouns in this
case are different. because of the changes that concern the tone levels
(Bashir forthcoming). The agentive nouns take a low tone levels
compared with the verbal nouns that take high tone. For example:
(33)
ANglossa) kʊhaal'a field guard'b) kʊdadɪɪ'theif'c) kʌɽheel'a carpenter'd) kawataal'a porter'e) kɔdɔwa'a lawyer'On the other hand, a few examples of the agentive nouns do not seem to
be derived from any other word classes and they are purely nouns which
describe professions as in (34).","[304, 305, 306]"
"4.4.1.1 Future
Tima makes a grammatical distinction with regard to the future tense.
That is, the future tense in Tima is marked overtly by the obligatory
morpheme 'dV-'. The future marker 'dV' precedes the verb root as in (29).(29) cen-den-diik
ASP.1sg-FUT.1sg-goi-l-umurik
DIR-LOC-Tima area'I will go to the Tima area'Dahl (2006) mentions that the future marking devices derive historically
from a number of sources; for example they may come from motion verbs
like 'go and come' or from an intention auxiliary like 'will' in English. The
future marker in Tima probably is originally derived from the motion
verb 'diyaŋ' which means 'come'. The verb 'diyaŋ' itself can be divided
into 'di' which means 'come' and a ventive marker 'aŋ', the epenthetic
glide 'y' is just inserted in order to separate between vowel sequences in a159word. This verb form was either reduced phonetically to 'di' when it is
used as a future marker, or its root form was retained only where it
grammaticalized into a future marker. The future tense marker will be
referred to as 'dV' where the 'V' is an underspecified vowel. This vowel
differs according to the form of the subject marker which is attached to
the verb. See the paradigm in (30) below. where the future tense marker
is underlined.","[180, 181]"
"20drunk' (Anderson, 1985b). It is noticed that the vowel is 'i' in the present,
in the past the vowel is changed into 'a' while in the participle the vowel
is changed into 'u'. Semitic languages are other examples which have an
extensive system of vowel alternations. Consonant alternation is quite
common in many African languages and it plays a grammatical function.
For example, in Laggori (a Nilo-Saharan language) there is an alternation
with the root-initial consonant which distinguishes between 1sg and 2 pl
in the imperative forms (e.g. the consonant 'k' is changed into 'g')
(Alamin, 2008). Many languages mark grammatical categories of a word
with suprasegmental features such as stress and tone. In Spanish verbs,
the stress plays a role in distinction of tense. On the other hand, many
West African languages use the tone in order to mark the tense/aspect
distinctions (Payne, 1997).
The processes of stem modifications mentioned above are also attested in
the building of Tima words. The vowel alternation is found in many Tima
verbs, especially with verbs indicating pluractionalality (see Section
4.5.1.2). It also distinguishes between perfective and imperfective aspect
(Chapter 4, Section 4.6.3.). In addition, the consonant alternation is also
found with verbs when the initial consonant in the imperative form is
conjugated (e.g. the consonant 'j' is changed into 'c', see Chapter 4 for
examples). The tone is also lexicalized in Tima. The change in tone level
changes the meaning of the word as well. For example, 'ɪ̀hɪ̀', 'milk (N) LL
and 'ɪ́hɪ̀', 'milk (V)' HL (Bashir forthcoming). In this example the change
in tone level does not only change the meaning of the word within one
class but also the class of the word is changed.","[41, 42]"
"111It has been found in the data that adjectives in Tima are inflected for
locative pronouns as in (86). In this respect, Tima adjectives behave like

3.2.2.1 Cardinal Numbers
Most languages in the world (whether written or unwritten) have a
particular system of counting. Almost all natural number systems are
either based-five (quintenary) as in Laggori (Alamin, 2006) or based-ten
(decimal). Similar to adjectives, numerals in Tima are used as modifiers
of nouns. The numeral system of Tima is built on decimal basis, i.e. a ten
base system. It has native terms for numbers from one up to one
113thousand. The Tima numbers, like adjectives, have two forms of prefixes:
the prefix /a-/ʌ-/which is attached to number 'one' and the prefix /ɪ-/i/which is attached to the numbers from 2 to 10. These prefixes indicate
singularity and plurality of numbers, respectively. See the Tima cardinal
numbers from 1 to 10 below.","[132, 133, 134, 135]"

'you (pl) will go'All the enclitic subject markers remain without any changes in their
phonological forms, except for the form of the first person singular,
'kɨdʌ'. It first takes the short forms 'dʌ' in most cases as mentioned above,
and it is not usually influenced by the vowel harmony of the verb root,
although it is found that in some cases it is in fact influenced by the
harmony of the root (Bashir forthcoming). The vowel of the 1sg pronoun
becomes a rounded vowel when the verb root contains a back vowel, as in
example (21) below.

Table (3.4) above can help to elicit a general rule for a noun phrase in
Tima. The rule is:
NP→ N + (dem) + (poss pron) + (adj.age) + (adj.color) + (adj.value) +
(num/quant).",[156]
"The order of the constituents in the expressions above is:N + 'li-y-ʌŋ' + (LOC+ N)It is found that the locative marker 'li-' in the expression 'li-yʌŋ' undergoes
some phonological changes. It is changed according to the preceding
sound of the noun which precedes it. Therefore, a regressive assimilation
occurs. The sentences in (43) express this process.

"The word structure of the examples which are taken in the imperative
forms in (137) is:
R (IMP) + ANP + APPL
It is found in the data that when a sentence includes a direct object and a
nominal indirect object, the benefactive marker '-ii' is attached directly
before the nominal indirect object as in (143).

Recipient applicative means that the recipient becomes a direct object
when an applicative marker is added to the verb. It is usually an animate
participant to whom an entity is transferred (Haspelmath, 2002).","[249, 250]"
"4.5.2.1.1 Reflexive
Reflexive is a derivational process which usually reduces the verb
valency i.e. the number of arguments in a sentence. Reflexive refers to a
construction of a verb where the subject/agent and the object/patient are
the same entity (Foley and Van Valin, 1985).
Tima uses different operations of expressing reflexivity. Firstly, Tima has
an overt marker which is also attested as an antipassive marker, the suffix
'-ak'. That is, reflexivity in Tima is marked morphologically 24. It occurs
in P2 in Table 4.5. Its canonical shape is represented as 'VC'. The suffix
vowel harmonizes according to the root vowel (i.e. either ±ATR).
Different verb forms with reflexive suffix are shown in (146).",[252]
