"Morphosyntactic patternsThe basic constituent order of Toqabaqita is subject – predicate – X, where X
designates any element other than the subject and the predicate. Predicates may
be headed by a verb or be verbless, as in (3-1) and (3-2), respectively. The subjects and the predicates are in square brackets, and so is the adjunct in (3-1):

cold.windMore than one adjunct can occur in a clause, but for most types their order is
not strictly fixed. Temporal adjuncts normally come last, unless a clause contains an element that can only occur clause-finally, such as a situational demonstrative adverb. The second clause in (3-3) contains a locative-source and a
temporal adjunct:

GENP44Grammatical profileIn verbal clauses the basic order is SVX and AVOX, where S represents an
intransitive subject, A a transitive subject, O a direct object, and V a verb.
Clauses are organized on a nominative-accusative pattern. Ss and As are indexed by means of preverbal subject markers that simultaneously mark other
grammatical categories: tense, aspect, sequentiality, negation, or dehortation.
Lexical Os are indexed by suffixes on verbs. (Direct objects encoded by means
of the independent personal pronouns can occur only with one of the two main
classes of transitive verbs and are not indexed.) In (3-4) the S is indexed by the
first person singular nonfuture subject marker ku, and so is the A in (3-5). The
lexical O doqora-mu ‘your sibling’ (here ‘your brother’) in (3-5) is indexed by
the third person object suffix -a.

Verbs can be accompanied by a variety of particles, some of which precede
the verb and some of which follow. In noun phrases most of the modifiers are
postnominal, but some are prenominal. All of the adpositions are prepositions.
To the extent that the relations betweens heads and their dependents are
overtly marked, Toqabaqita is predominantly head-marking in the terminology
of Nichols (1986). Direct objects are indexed on the verb; see (3-5) above.
Clausal direct objects are indexed on the higher verb. In (3-6) the complement
clause is in brackets:
(3-6)Nau ku
thathami-a
[kwai
1SG.FUT
1SG 1SG.NFUT want-3.OBJ
‘I want to eat.’ (Lit.: ‘I want I will eat.’)fanga].
eatIn two types of noun phrase, associative and possessive, the head noun carries a suffix that marks the relation, an associative suffix in the former, as in (37), and a personal suffix in the latter, as in (3-8):3.1 Morphosyntactic patterns(3-7)thaalu-qi

child-3.PERS child

thisTwo classes of prepositions take suffixes to index their objects. One takes
personal suffixes also used on the possessum nouns in one type of possessive
construction to index the possessor:

wane
qena
LOC REC-3.PERS

ifu-na
qaburu baa
ALL-3.OBJ hair-3.PERS

that
‘[reach] for the ogre’s hair’Compare (3-5) further above.
Some of the forms that function as prepositions and take object suffixes can
also take clauses as their objects and may index them with the same suffix -a:

PURP-3.OBJ 1SG.FUT goPRFCompare (3-10) further above.
Those heads of phrases that index their dependents can have only lexical
noun phrase modifiers (or clause modifiers), not pronominal modifiers. The
possessive noun phrase in (3-12) is ungrammatical because of the presence of
the pronoun in the possessor position:46Grammatical profile(3-12)thaina-na
(*nia)
mother-3SG.PERS 3SG
‘his/her mother’Compare (3-8) further above with a lexical possessor noun phrase.
And (3-13) is ungrammatical because of the pronoun in the direct object
position:

2SG.NFUT see-3SG.OBJ 3SG
‘Did you see him/her/it?’Compare (3-5) further above with a lexical direct object. For the difference
in the glossing of the suffix -a, 3.OBJ in (3-5) and 3SG.OBJ in (3-13), see below.
Those types of heads that index their adjuncts or complements can occur
without an adjunct or a complement, as (3-12) and (3-13) above show. Under
such circumstances the object and the personal suffixes specify the person and
the number of the participant. This is shown in (3-14) and (3-15) for the third
person singular and plural object suffixes, respectively, and in (3-16) and (3-17)
for the third person singular and dual personal suffixes, respectively:

picture-3DU.PERS
‘their picture’ (that is, a picture that depicts the two of them)However, when a lexical complement is present, the number contrast is neutralized, and the singular suffixes are used regardless of the grammatical number of the dependent. Because here the suffixes do not mark the number, the
number is not specified in the glosses.","[72, 73, 74, 75]"
"14.2.4. In the direct-object position with Class 2 transitive verbs, in the
oblique-object position with the noun-like prepositions, and in the possessor position in the suffixing possessive noun phrase
What all these positions have in common is the fact that elsewhere the heads of
the constructions carry the same type of suffix to index the object or the possessor, called “object” suffixes when they occur on verbs, and “personal” suffixes
when they occur on the noun-like prepositions and on possessum nouns. Class 2
transitive verbs, the noun-like prepositions, and the possessum nouns in suffixing possessive constructions must carry an object/personal suffix, and they can
have only lexical objects/possessors.
With Class 2 transitive verbs, the noun-like prepositions, and suffixing possessive constructions, only one order of the constituents in phrasal inclusory
constructions is possible: the included NP must come first and the inclusory
pronoun second. In (14-18) the inclusory construction functions as the direct
object of the verb. The verb carries the third person “singular” object suffix,
used elsewhere with lexical objects. The proximity principle applies here.

‘They know my child and me.’kamareqa.
1DU(EXCL)If the order were kamareqa wela nau ‘me and my child’, with the inlusory
pronominal coming first, the construction would be ungrammatical. The ungrammaticality of inclusory constructions where it is the inclusory pronoun that
comes next to the verb can be explained by appeal to the proximity principle. A
Class 2 transitive verb must carry an object suffix and cannot have a pronoun as
its direct object. If the inclusory pronoun occurred next to the verb, there would
be a clash between the object suffix and the object pronoun: *thaitoqomamareqa kamareqa wela nau ‘know-1DU(EXCL).OBJ 1DU(EXCL) child 1SG’. The14.2 Phrasal inclusory constructions663same kind of clash would exist in the case of the noun-like prepositions and
their objects, and between possessum nouns and the possessor phrases. For the
clash between a personal suffix on a possessum noun and a pronoun in the possessor position see (14-20) further below.
Examples (14-19) and (14-20) below contain inclusory constructions in the
possessor position. In (14-19) the included NP comes before the inclusory pronoun, and the construction is grammatical. The possessum noun manta
‘thought’ carries the third person “singular” personal suffix, used elsewhere in
the suffixing possessive construction when the possessor is lexical. That is, the
proximity principle applies here.

manner that
‘The thinking of my father and me is like that.’ ‘That is what my
father and I think.’
On the other hand, in (14-20) the inclusory pronoun comes first, before the
included NP, and the construction is ungrammatical. The possessum is the locational noun buria ‘behind’ (section 10.8.3).

PERSMKRInclusory constructions where the order is [inclusory-pronoun included-NP]
cannot function as objects of Class 2 transitive verbs and the noun-like preposition, or as possessors in suffixing possessive constructions. However, if they
have been “displaced” from those positions, such sentences are grammatical.
One way in which an inclusory construction may be displaced is by being
placed in a later position, as a kind of “afterthought”, for example for clarification. The verb, the preposition, or the possessum noun carries an object/possessor suffix that denotes the superset, and the later inclusory construction provides more detail by specifying the subset. Typically, there is a slight
pause between the displaced inclusory construction and the preceding material,
indicated by a comma in the examples below. While (14-20) above, with an
inclusory construction in the possessor position, is ungrammatical, (14-21)664Constructions with inclusory pronominalsbelow, with the inclusory construction outside, after the possessor position, is
grammatical:

behind-1DU(EXCL).PERS 1DU(EXCL)niSaelifiqa.
Saelifiqa
‘Follow the two of us, me and Saelifiqa.’
PERSMKRSimilarly, (14-22) is grammatical even though the order of the constituents
in the inclusory construction is [inclusory-pronoun included-NP], because the
inclusory construction does not function as the direct object of the Class 2 transitive verb:
(14-22)Kera
thaitoqoma-mareqa,

3PL.NFUT know-1DU(EXCL).OBJ
‘They know the two of us, me and my child.’See (14-18) further above and the accompanying discussion.
An inclusory construction can be displaced into the topic position, and there
too the order [inclusory-pronoun included-NP] is grammatical. In (14-23) below, the inclusory construction occurs in the possessor position, and the order
can only be [included-NP inclusory-pronoun]. (The person marker tha has
fused with the possessum noun, and so the third person personal suffix -na is
absent.)

‘The picture of you two, you and Uluta, is very nice.’14.2.5. In the object position with the bare prepositions and in the possessor
position in the bare possessive noun phrase
The bare prepositions do not index their complements, and similarly the possessum nouns of bare possessive constructions do not index the possessor
phrases. When a phrasal inclusory construction functions as the complement of
a bare preposition or as the possessor phrase in a bare possessive construction,
the inclusory pronominal and the included NP can occur in either order. The
examples in (14-26) and (14-27) illustrate this for the equative preposition
mala, and those in (14-28) and (14-29) for possessive constructions:

type of interrogative sentence where the verb together with an interrogative
phrase precede the subject. This order occurs in one subtype of locational interrogative sentences: a locative verb followed by one of the forms for ‘where?’
precedes the subject:
(19-37)[locative.verb ‘where?’] subjectFor example:
(19-38)Nii
fei
naifa nau baa?
be.located where? knife 1SG that
‘Where is my knife?’ ‘Where is that knife of mine?’Although the verb phrase precedes the subject, it is not in the focus position.
First, the focus marker na cannot occur here. Second, a locative prepositional
phrase that contains fei can be fronted by itself and be in focus. In such cases a
prepositional phrase that consists of the general locative preposition qi and the
locative pro-form ei (section 10.2.2) must appear at the extraction site. In (1939) the locative interrogative phrase i fei ‘(at) where?’ is in focus, and there is a
prepositional phrase with the locative pro-form after the locative verb:
(19-39)Nee, ma

LOCfei
na
qaburu naqi qe

be.located=LOC LOCPRO
‘Hey, where is this ogre [we have been talking about]?’
On the other hand, the locative pro-form is not used in the inverted word
order; see (19-38).
And third, as discussed in section 19.3.11, certain intensifying particles can
be used inside interrogative phrases to express emphatic questions, but only if
the interrogative phrase is in focus. In (19-40) the intensifier is qana:

"With the exception of the type of interrogative with inverted, [verb.phrase
subject] order and one other type of sentence where the verb comes before the
subject (negative existential sentences, discussed in section 26.1.2.2), verbs
cannot occur before their subjects, whether in interrogatives or elsewhere, and
the interrogative verbs qufita ‘be how?’, ‘do what?’, ‘do how?’ and its transitive counterpart qufita-a ‘do what? to/with (st.)’, ‘do st. how?’ can only occur

not categorical, either in terms of their use or in the syntactic conditions under
which the constructions occur. For this reason no separate type of echo interrogatives is recognized for Toqabaqita.
Only one interrogative phrase is possible in a clause, regardless of whether
both of them were to be in situ or one of them were to be fronted.

non-final component or components that make up a fused word lose some of
their phonological material at their ends, a segment, a syllable or even two syllables. With one type of exception, the final component occurs in its full form.
The exception is grammatical elements that begin with a glottal stop: they lose
the glottal stop when fused to the preceding element. Words that have fused
together behave as single phonological words for the purposes of stress assignment.
Fusion is signalled in the grammar by means of an equal sign: =, including
when examples are presentend in the orthography.
Fusion may involve grammatical words or lexical words. In some cases,
fusion is obligatory. Obligatory fusion involves certain combinations of grammatical words: when two or three such words occur next to each other, fusion
must take place. The reduced forms in which morphemes that obligatorily undergo fusion occur are referred to in the grammar as the “combining” forms of
those morphemes. (A few morphemes must occur in their combining forms
when a bound morpheme is suffixed to them.)
Fusion is obligatory when certain postverbal particles occur next to each
other. A few examples are given in (2-79). (For further discussion and examples see section 5.2.)36Phonology(2-79)a.b./bn!n/ and

normal speech, the demonstrative /!er+/ ‘this’, ‘that’ and the plural marker /k+/
always fuse as /!'=k+/ ‘those’, ‘these’, although the unfused sequence /!er+/ /k+/
is accepted by speakers of the language as grammatical. The sequence of /k7la/
‘place’ and /na!+/ ‘this’ is normally realized as /k7=na!+/, rather than without
fusion.
The general preposition /!ana/ more often than not fuses with consonantinitial monosyllabic grammatical morphemes. It either has the form /!a=/, or
/!an=/. /!a=/ occurs regardless of the nature of the following consonant, while
/!an=/ occurs only before dental consonants:

"2.3 Stress23The stress pattern of a base is retained when affixes, derivational or inflectional, are added, unless this would result in a sequence of more than two unstressed syllables.
A few transitive verbs contain two derivational suffixes: a monosyllabic
stem extender followed by a long, disyllabic transitive suffix. All such verbs
have disyllabic roots. For stress assignment purposes, the stem extender is
treated as part of the stem and does not receive stress, while the transitive suffix
is stressed on its first syllable. In (2-45a) there is an intransitive verb, a long
transitive verb with the stem extender /-la/ and the long transitive suffix /-0an+/
based on the intransitive verb; and in (2-45b) there is a short transitive verb
derived from the same base by means of the short, monosyllabic transitive suffix /-l+/, without the stem extender:
(2-45)
a./takdp'/ [tapkdp'] and /takdp'-la-0an+-a/
[taykdp'la0pn+]
‘stand’
stand-EXT-TR-3SG.OBJ
‘stand him/her/it up’b./takdp'-l+-a/
[taykdp'l+p]
‘stand-TR-3SG.OBJ
‘of many people: stand all over it [a place]’There is a general preference for bases to have trisyllabic feet, where possible; thus, [taykdp'la0pn+] ‘stand him/her/it up’, rather than *[taykdp'lay0n+p]. This
preference for three-syllable feet is also manifested in the next types of case.
Most inflectional suffixes are monosyllabic. In a few cases what are historically two inflectionals suffixes are present simultaneously, a monosyllabic one
followed by a disyllabic one. The monosyllabic suffix is never stressed, while
the disyllabic one is stressed on its first syllable. In (2-45) the base is disyllabic,
and there are only two unstressed syllables next to each other.
(2-46)/0al+/ [0pl+]
‘take’and/0al+-da-rn!a/
[0yl+ndrnp!a]
take-3PL.OBJ-“DU”
‘take them (two)’The verbal root /0al+/ and the suffix /-da/ together constitute one tri-syllabic
foot: [0yl+ndrnp!a], not *[0yl+ndprn!a].
On the other hand, in (2-47) the base is trisyllabic, and here its last syllable
is stressed in order to avoid a sequence of three unstressed syllables:
(2-47)/aa+/ /apa:$+/
and
confective preposition/aa+-da-rn!a/ [aya:$+yndrnp!a]
CONF-3PL.OBJ-“DU”24Phonology(Although historically /-da-rn!a/ and a few other such forms are polymorphemic, they are treated in this grammar as unanalyzed wholes; thus, /-darn!a/
third person dual object, third person dual personal; etc.)
With two types of exception, the few prefixes of Toqabaqita are all disyllabic, and those occasion no change in the stress pattern of the stem. The first
syllable of the derived word receives stress:
(2-48)a./tnda/ (tr. v.) [tnpda] and /kdpa+-tnda-+/ [kdpy+tnpnd+]
LIP-meet-LIP
‘meet’
‘meet each other’b./mar7k+/ [mpr7k+]
‘be alive’and/a!a-mar7k+/ [ay!ampr7k+]
CAUS-be.alive‘save sb.’s life’ (person as direct
object)
The causative prefix has two forms: /a!a-/ and /a-/. The monosyllabic
allomorph is used, optionally, only in combination with the low-inividuationof-participants (LIP) prefix /kdpa+/ (see (2-48a above) in a small number of verbs:
/kdpa+-a-/. For the purposes of stress assignment /kdpa+-a-/ forms one trisyllabic foot with the stress on the first syllable and there is no effect on the stress
pattern of the base. On the other hand, when the disyllabic form of the causative prefix is used after the LIP prefix, it receives stress on its first syllable, and
again there is no effect on the stress pattern of the base.
(2-49)/ma!7/ [mp!7]
‘be afraid’and/kdpa+-a-ma!7-+/

‘be frightening’also /kdpa+-a!a-ma!7-+/
[kdpy+$y!amp!7+]
LIP-CAUS-be.afraid-LIP
‘be frightening’
Monosyllabic prefixation is also found in a number of words that involve
reduplication. Reduplication by prefixation normally involves disyllabic reduplicants. The first syllable of the word is stressed, and so is the first syllable of
the base.
(2-50)a./aa-a!a-7la7/[aya:$ay!7pl$7]RDP-CAUS-work.hard‘keep on making sb. work hard’2.3 Stressb./ma!a-ma!ar7/
RDP-blink
‘blink repeatedly’25[may!amap!r7]However, in a number of words the reduplicants are monosyllabic. The first
syllable of the word receives stress, but there is no stress on the first syllable of
the base, because two adjacent syllables cannot be stressed, except in cases of
vowel elision; see rule III further above. In (2-59d) it is the second rather than
the first syllable of the base that is stressed.
(2-51)a./tn-tnl+/[tnptnl+]RDP-descend‘landslip, landslide’

d./7l-7la7/[7y:l7lp$7]RDP-work.hard‘keep on working hard’
Compare [0gdbap0gdbr+] ‘of a person: feel cold’ in (2-51b), with a monosyllabic reduplicant and no stress on the initial syllable of the base [0gdbr+], and
[0gdbaya:0gdbpr+!] ‘of a place: be pleasantly cool, shaded’, with a disyllabic reduplicant and stress on the initial syllable of the same base, [0gdbpr+]. (/-!a/ is a
proprietive suffix that derives stative intransitive verbs.) And compare also
[7y:l7lp$7] ‘keep on working hard’ in (2-51d), with a monosyllabic reduplicant
and stress on the second rather than the first syllable of the base, and
[aya:$ay!7pl$7] ‘keep on making sb. work hard’ in (2-50a) further above, with
two disyllabic prefixes and stress on the first syllable of the same base, [7pl$7],
In compounds, each element is stressed in the same way as when it functions
as a word on its own, with a few exceptions. For example:
(2-52)a./aln-ma'/
[aylnmap']
taro-die
‘blight that affects taro plants’26Phonologyb./k77k77-!nrn/

[aykalnmp7r+]
ancestral.spirit-be.active
‘ancestral spirit that is still active’
/ma7r+/ does not exist as a word on its own, but there is also
/r7ka-ma7r+/, phonetically [r7ykmp7r+], ‘water spring that
never dries out’ (/r7ka/ ‘water spring’)Both compounds in (2-53) below contain five syllables, but in the one in (253a) the primary stress is on the third syllable, which is the initial syllable of
the second member of the compound, while in the compound in (2-53b) the
primary stress is on the fourth syllable, which is the initial syllable of the second member of the compound:
(2-53)a./m''-!7la7/
[m'y':!7pl7]
tongue-frog.sp
‘young coconut with very soft flesh’b./77s7-!a+/
[7y:7s7!p+]
follow-tree
‘bird sp.: Common Kingfisher’The fact that (with some exceptions discussed further below) the components of compounds retain their lexical stress makes it possible, in principle at
least, for two compounds to be phonetically distinct only in their stress patterns:. CVyCV-CVpCVCV vs CVyCVCV-CVpCV, with identical consonants and
vowels in identical positions in the two compounds. However, no such minimal
pair has come to light.
There are a few lexicalized phrases that are exceptional to the rule that lexical items retain their stress patterns in compounds. All of them contain the
monosyllabic general locative preposition /!+/ in its variant form /+/. As a monosyllabic preposition, /+/ not stressed, and its presence in a compound may require an additional stress in order to avoid a sequence of three unstressed sylla-2.3 Stress27bles. In the lexicalized phrase in (2-54) the component before the preposition is
disyllabic and no additional stress is necessary:
/man-+-k+l7/
[may$n+k+pl7]
heal-LOC-hole
‘chronic ulcer, sore’ (it only heals in the hole, that is,
in the person’s grave)(2-54)However, in the lexicalized phrase in (2-55) the component before the
preposition is trisyllabic. In the lexicalized phrase its last syllable receives
stress in order for three unstressed syllables in a row to be avoided:
/mn!ns7-+-l7ma/

‘sleep’

"852Imperatives20.3.1. Negative imperatives in present-day Toqabaqita
In the present-day language, negative imperatives are expressed by means of
the same negative strategies used in declarative sentences, using the negative
subject markers (chapter 17). Both the simple and the double negative constructions, the latter employing the negative verb aqi, occur in imperatives. The double negative strategy is somewhat more emphatic than the simple strategy. The
next two examples illustrate the simple and the double constructions, respectively:

‘Don’t laugh at me.’(20-39)Qe=aqi

3SG.NFUT=NEGV 2DU.NEG

LIP-interruptNegative imperatives too can be used with a variety of illocutionary forces,
such as orders and commands (as in the two examples just above), advice,
warnings, requests, entreaties, dehortations, and dissuasions. They can be used
either to prevent a new state of affairs from coming about or to stop a state of
affairs that already exists or that has existed previously. In the latter type of
case, the verb is often reduplicated when the state of affairs has existed for a
relatively extended period of time or when it has occurred on multiple occasions previously. (Reduplication of verbs serves to express the continuative/iterative aspect; see section 15.2.3.) Like positive imperatives, negative
imperatives are most common with second-person subjects, but subjects of
other grammatical persons are possible as well. Examples (20-40) – (20-44)
have second-person subjects.

"Associations between thematic consonants and meaningsWhile the thematic consonants are not independently meaningful and cannot be
said to contribute to, or modify, the meanings of verbs in specific ways, it is at
the same time the case that certain thematic consonants, rather than others, are
more likely to occur in verbs of certain meanings, with some qualifications.11
First, this preference is not much more than a tendency, and there are exceptions. And second, the various thematic consonants do not occur with equal
frequency. The most common thematic consonant is f, especially in short transitives, followed by s in short transitives and t in long transitives, with l a distant
third (occurring only in short transitives). On the other hand, q and zero, both in
short transitives, are quite rare. And it is precisely f, s/t and, to a lesser extent, l
that exhibit some such tendencies. And finally, while verbs of certain meanings
may be more likely to contain certain thematic consonants rather than others,
the converse is not true: a given thematic consonant may occur with verbs of
very different meanings. The examples of tendencies given below concern f, s/t
and l as thematic consonants. This is where the tendencies are most apparent,
although this may be partly an artefact of their frequency of use.
Verbs that are synonyms or near synonyms of each other typically take identical thematic consonants:98The verb phrase(4-110)(4-111)a.kuqu-fi (normal word)

‘drink’a.ngata-li

‘return; take, put back’b.roki-fani/roki-tani
‘return; take, put back’Verbs that belong in the same semantic field also tend to contain the same
thematic consonants. Thus, with one exception, short transitive verbs of excretion and secretion select s, while the corresponding long transitives select t:

‘You, how manieth now of time you have arrived in the Solomons?’)19.3.7. Fei, fania, fana ‘where?’
The three interrogative words fei, fania, and fana are all used to inquire about
locations, but the latter two also have one other function (discussed in section
19.3.8). Fei is a locative adverb (section 4.11). It is the commonest locative
interrogative word and occurs in several constructions. Fania and fana are particles. They are emphatic forms, and their locative use is restricted to one type
of construction.
It is necessary to distinguish locational-sentence interrogatives and other
interrogatives concerning locations. Locational-sentence interrogatives correspond to locational declaratives (section 26.1), and their function is to ask questions ‘Where is X?’. They employ the locative verbs nii ‘be located’ or, much
less commonly, ii ‘be located’. Locational-sentence interrogatives are discussed
first, starting with those using fei.
There are three basic strategies for forming locational-sentence interrogatives using fei. In one, both the fei phrase and the locative verb are in situ, with
fei following the verb. No preposition is used with fei. In another strategy fei is
fronted and it is the complement of the locative preposition qi. In the third strategy the locative verb and fei precede the subject. No preposition is used with
fei. The first two examples below contain interrogatives with both the verb and
fei in situ. This type of construction is by no means uncommon and need not
express an echo question.

extraction site. The fronted prepositional phrase with fei is placed in focus.

‘Hey, where is this ogre [we have been talking about]?’
This is the least common of the three types of locational-sentence interrogatives. This may be owing to its relative complexity, because in addition to the
fronted interrogative prepositional phrase with fei another prepositional phrase,
with the locative pro-form ei, is required.
In the third strategy, the locative verb and fei precede the subject: nii/ii fei
X, X being the subject, ‘where is X?’, literally ‘is located where X?’; see also
(19-37) in section 19.3.2. As discussed in that section, even though the locative
verb and fei precede the subject, they are not in the focus position. Locational
interrogative sentences with inverted, [verb.phrase subject] order are used commonly.

synonymous. The difference in form between them is reminiscent of the difference between the full and the reduced forms of the verb-like prepositions (section 10.3.1), for example the ablative forms fasi-a (with the third person singular object suffix -a) and fasa. However, in present-day Toqabaqita at least,
fania and fana do not function as prepositions, and there is no evidence of fania
being morphologically complex (*fani-a).
In (19-120) variant (b), with fania, expresses a more emphatic, insistent
question about the location than variant (a), with fei, does.

"There are a few causative verbs with the prefix faqa- which do not have
intransitive counterparts in present-day Toqabaqita. In the absence of historical
evidence it is impossible to tell whether these synchronic irregularities are the110The verb phraseresult of loss of an intransitive verb or whether those verbs were irregular when
they were first formed. For example, there is a causative verb faqa-thata ‘give a
name to, bestow a name on (esp. a child)’, but there is no corresponding intransitive verb, only a noun, thata ‘name’. There is a causative verb faqa-oome
‘provoke sb.’ but no verb *oome. However, there is a noun oomea ‘enemy’,
‘fight, war’, which may historically be a deverbal noun *oome-a (section 9.2).
And there is a causative verb faqa-qafe-tani/faqa-qafe-taqi ‘make it difficult to
deal with st.; create obstacles to st. being done’ and an intransitive verb qafetaqi ‘be difficult to do, difficult to cope with, difficult to do st. about’, but no
*qafetani. The existence of the variant faqa-qafe-tani suggests that qafetaqi
was originally a long transitive verb, *qafe-taqi, and as such had the variant
qafe-tani.
There are several cases of verbs that carry the prefix faqa-, which, however,
are intransitive verbs. In some cases there are also transitive verbs with the
prefix, and so the intransitive forms are most likely instances of conversion. For
example, besides transitive faqa-waela ‘make sb. laugh’ there is intransitive
faqa-waela ‘be a funny person; make other people laugh’; cf. waela (intr.)
‘laugh’. And besides the transitive variants faqa-futa and faqa-futa-ngani ‘of a
woman: give birth to’, there is intransitive faqa-futa ‘bear a child, give birth’;
cf. futa ‘be born’. However, in some cases an intransitive verb with the prefix
faqa- has no transitive counterpart. For example, there is intransitive faqa-rakeqiri ‘make angry’ with the person made angry expressed as an oblique object,
and there is another intransitive verb rake-qiri ‘be, get angry’, which is a subject-incorporating compound (section 12.3.2): rake ‘belly’, qiri ‘be angry’. And
there is intransitive faqa-sobo ‘eat’, besides short transitive sobo-ngi ‘support,
prop up’, also metaphorially ‘eat’ (direct object coreferential with subject; lit.:
‘prop oneself up’) and intransitive sobo ‘take over from sb. in carrying st. in
order to help them out’; but there is no transitive *faqa-sobo.
There is one verb with the prefix faqa- which is formally highly irregular. It
is an intransitive verb, and it contains two instances of the prefix faqa- or, alternatively, one instance of the prefix may be realized as fa-. The variant faalso occurs with another verb with the same base intransitive verb, but with no
other verb in the language. This irregular verb is a member of the following set
of forms:
(4-137) a.maqu ‘be afraid’b.faqa-maqu (tr.) ‘frighten’c.faqa-maqu (intr.) ‘be great in quantity, degree’, also used as
an intensifier after other verbs4.2 Types of verbs111d.kwai-faqa-maqu-i, also kwai-fa-maqu-i (intr.) ‘be frightening’

(LIP) affixes (section 21.3). They form intransitive, depatientive verbs from
transitive ones: kwai-faqa-maqu-i ‘be frightening’ is based on transitive, causative faqa-maqu ‘frighten’ (see [4-137b]). And this intransitive verb in turn takes
another instance of the prefix faqa-, the resulting verb faqa-kwai-faqa-maqu-i
also being intransitive. Whether there ever was a transitive verb faqa-kwaifaqa-maqu-i is impossible to tell.
In faqa-kwai-faqa-maqu-i one instance of faqa- follows and one precedes
the kwai- prefix. There is evidence from other verbs that the causative prefix
and the depatientive LIP prefix can occur in either order, although there are only
a few words in which the two prefixes cooccur. In some, the order is CAUS-LIPbase. The LIP prefix derives an intransitive verb from a transitive base, and the
causative prefix derives a different transitive verb:

‘A doctor is a person who saves lives.’ ‘A doctor is a person who

fit into any of the three categories: (i) direct, immediate causation; (ii) indirect
causation; and (iii) instructive, assistive causation.
In direct, immediate causation there is typically physical contact between
the causer and the causee, often resulting in a change of the causee’s state:
(4-142) a.faqa-gwina ‘make wet; moisten’; cf. gwina ‘be wet’b.faqa-iana ‘make pregnant; impregnate’; cf. iana ‘be pregnant’c.faqa-baqita ‘think highly of; show respect to’; cf. baqita ‘be
big, large’, ‘be important, respected’d.faqa-kokoto ‘straighten, make straight’, ‘fix, resolve (a problem)’; cf. kokoto ‘be straight’, ‘be correct, proper’In indirect causation the causer does something which has an effect on the
causee without there being physical contact, manipulation. Sometimes the
causer acts only verbally.
(4-143) a.faqa-oli-fani ‘send sb. back’; cf. oli ‘return’b.faqa-bona ‘make sb. quiet; hush sb.’; cf. bona ‘be quiet, silent; not speak’c.faqa-toqowane ‘give one’s daughter away in a marriage ceremony’; cf. toqowane ‘of a woman: be, get married’4.2 Types of verbsd.","[138, 139, 140, 141, 142]"
"IntroductionThe postverbal particles occur before lexical direct objects, but after direct
objects that are realized by independent personal pronouns; see (4-1) in section
4.1. The postverbal particles are listed in table 5.2 in the order in which they
occur in a verb complex, which is also the order in which they are discussed.
Those that occupy the same position in the verb complex and so are mutually
exclusive are grouped together in the table under the same letter. More than one
postverbal particle can occur simultaneously in a verb phrase.
Some of the particles have shorter, combining forms used when those particles fuse with a following particle. This kind of fusion between certain particles
is obligatory. Some of the combining forms are also used when a particle carries a personal suffix. Only the full forms of the particles are listed in table 5.2.
The combining forms are presented in the respective sections.
Most of the particles also occur in noun phrases, although not necessarily
with the same meaning. Those particles that also occur in noun phrases are
marked with an asterisk in the table.
The first two pairs of examples show the positioning of the postverbal particles before lexical direct objects and after pronominal direct objects, respectively. In the first pair the particle is the precedentive one, fasi:

"Other uses of the sequential markers in positive clausesIn their central function the sequential subject markers signal that the onset of
the situation of their clause follows the onset of the situation expressed in a
preceding clause. This also appears to be the case in the next example, although
most likely it is not. There the speaker recounts his visit to a zoo and uses a
number of sequential clauses. The visit had taken place a number of years previously, and it is highly unlikely that the order of the clauses corresponds exactly to the order in which he had seen the animals. Rather, the order of the
clauses reflects the order in which the speaker’s recollection unfolds.

‘I saw lots and lots of (different) animals (lit.: exceptionally many

um, gorillas, I saw monkeys, I saw peacocks, I saw elephants; ….’
The speaker did see the various animals in sequence as he was walking through
the zoo, although the sequence of the clauses is unlikely to mirror the sequence
of the events.
Evidence that sometimes the use of the sequential subject markers mirrors
the order in which the speaker thinks of the situations also comes from cases
where there is no sequentiality or no necessary sequentiality at all. For example, by saying (16-20) the speaker assigns different places to the women and to
the men. There is no indication that he wants first the women to stand in one
place and then the men in another place.

In (16-21) also the speaker uses the sequential markers, even though there is
no reason to assume that he began to recognize his father before he began to
recognize his mother. Rather, both began to be the case when he, as a baby, had16.2 Other uses in positive clauses729grown older. In this sentence the two “sequential” clauses are joined by the
conjunction bii, which only rarely conjoins clauses (section 28.2.3).

The sequential subject markers are also used when a preceding clause expresses a potential, contemplated, expected, or attempted situation that did not,
in fact, materialize. There is no sequentiality because the first situation did not
obtain; nevertheless, the second clause contains a sequential subject marker.
The second clause usually provides a comment concerning some relevant circumstances having to do with the non-occurrence of the potential/contemplated/expected/attempted situation. Even though the relevant situation did not materialize, the clause that expresses it is grammatically positive.
The situation’s non-occurrence is signalled by the irrealis marker sa (section
18.3).

‘They attempted to catch it [a bird] (lit.: they did in order to catch

clauses that are grammatically negative or that contain the verb aqi ‘not be so,
not be the case’, where the “sequential” clause makes it explicit that a potential
state of affairs did not, in fact, materialize.
Different kinds of departure from the central function of the sequential subject markers are found in constructions where there is no grounding clause.
That is, such constructions can be used without any prior relevant discourse.
The sequential subject markers are obligatory in the expression of the timitive
mood (section 18.6):
(16-24)Ada qoko
mataqi.
TIM 2SG.SEQ be.sick
‘You might be sick.’Historically the timitive construction was biclausal, the present-day timitive
marker being originally a verb with the meanings ‘see’, ‘look out, watch out’
(Lichtenberk 1995).
The sequential subject markers may be used in imperatives to soften their
force (section 20.2.3):
(16-25)Qoko
fanga
faqekwa.
be.small
2SG.SEQ eat
‘Eat slowly/in small pieces.’ ‘You should eat slowly/in small
pieces.’And the sequential subject markers are also used in one type of negative
construction, where they occur together with the irrealis marker sa. The clause
is grammatically positive, and it comes before the clause that expresses the
negation. This construction signals that a potential situation will or should not
obtain because of some disabling conditions (section 17.6):

While the three forms share the property of (optionally) taking the object

properties. Suli always has the object suffix (but see further below for the variant sula). On the other hand, uri and fasi not infrequently occur without the
suffix. It is more common for fasi than for uri to occur without the object suffix

There is no semantic difference between the variants with and without the
object suffix. It is possible that the two subordinators are in the process of losing the verb-like property of taking the object suffix. As discussed in section
10.3.1, all the verb-like prepositions have innovative, reduced forms which are
also unlike verbs, although there the original object suffix has been incorporated into the prepositions themselves: ura, fasa, sula, etc. The forms uri and
suli, used with reason clauses, also have reduced variants ura and sula, respectively, although these are used only rarely; see section 33.2 for examples.
The reason- and purpose-marking form uri and the reason-marking form suli
may be accompanied by the complementizer na (section 29.3), although this is
not very common. The complementizer immediately follows uri or suli, and is
itself followed by the reason or the purpose clause. This is likely to be due to1138Reason and purpose clausesuri and suli deriving historically from erstwhile transitive verbs that, presumably, could take complement clauses as their direct objects. With suli, the use of
the complementizer is less common than with uri (in either function of the latter). When the complementizer is present, suli and uri take the object suffix -a.
That is, the constructions with these two subordinators exhibit properties of
certain verbal constructions with complement clauses: the clause is indexed
with the object suffix and the complementizer may be present (sections 29.2.1
and 29.3).

"657Phrasal inclusory constructions14.2.1. The structure
In a phrasal inclusory construction there is an independent personal pronoun
that has the inclusory function and the included NP, and the two form a syntactic phrase. Under certain conditions, discussed in the subsequent sections, the
two elements can occur in either order. (See also section 14.2.7 for discussion
of the function of the variable ordering where it is permitted.) In (14-1) further
above, it is the inclusory pronoun that comes first, while in broadly synonymous (14-3) it is the included NP that comes first:
(14-3)Doqora-ku
kamareqa meki

goma=iqusungadi.
tomorrow
‘My brother and I will come tomorrow.’
VENT=LOCIn focusing and topicalization it is the inclusory construction as a whole that
is fronted. The inclusory pronoun and the included NP together form a noun
phrase. Example (14-4) contains a focused inclusory construction:
(14-4)Qedata kera na
kera
Qedata 3PL FOC 3PL.NFUTngali-a
mai iqa
carry-3.OBJ VENT fishnaqi.
this
‘It was Qedata with/and the others that brought this fish.’
For an example of a topicalized phrasal inclusory construction see (14-24) in
section 14.2.4.
Phrasal inclusory constructions are headed, and it is the inclusory pronoun
that is the head. First, when a phrasal inclusory construction occurs in the subject position of a verbal clause, it is the pronoun that determines the person,
number and exclusivity categories of the subject marker. The subject marker
agrees with the inclusory pronoun, regardless of the order of the inclusory pronoun and the included NP. Both in (14-1), where the inclusory pronoun comes
first, and in (14-3), where it comes second, the subject markers are first person
dual exclusive. See also examples (14-6) and (14-7) in section 14.2.2. For evidence of the head status of the inclusory pronoun in verbless sentences see (148) – (14-10), also in section 14.2.2.",[686]
"558CompoundingTopicalization is also relevant in the sentence in (12-21) further above, ‘The
man had a visitation, communication from an ancestral spirit’. The statement is
primarily about the man and what happened to him rather than about the ancestral spirit.
That it is foregrounding, topicalization of the notional possessor that is the
relevant factor is indirectly evidenced by the fact that when an analytic construction is used instead of the synonymous subject-incorporating compound, it
is common for the possessor to be topicalized (by fronting). (In addition, the
possessor is indexed on the possessum noun by a personal suffix.) This is
shown in (12-26), which corresponds to (12-25), and in (12-27), which corresponds to (12-23).

This type of compounding is severely restricted lexically. Compounds of this
type are endocentric and they are nouns. The modifying verb is transitive, but
only Class I transitive verbs participate in such compounds. In fact, almost all
the verbs that occur in such compounds are bare transitives. The verb carries
the third person (singular) object suffix -a, regardless of the grammatical number of the noun phrase headed by the compound. This suffix is used on Class 1
transitive verbs in verb phrases to index their lexical objects, also regardless of
the grammatical number of the object (section 4.2.3.2.1). However, while in a
verb phrase the order is [verb direct.object], in object-incorporating compounds
of this type the order is [noun verb].
One verb that occurs in an object-incorporating [noun verb] compound is
thare ‘bear (a child, young), give birth to’; ‘of female and male human parents:
beget’; also ‘feed’; ‘give food to’; ‘provide food for’; and ‘keep domestic and
pet animals’. In (12-30) the verb functions as the head of a verb phrase:
(12-30)… roo
twowela
childinomae
be.orphanedkero
3DU.NFUTthare-a
teqe botho.
keep.animal-3.OBJ one pig
‘… two orphaned children kept a pig.’
In an object-incorporating compound, thare-a occurs with wela ‘child’ as
the head and the compound has the meaning ‘fostered (lit.: fed) child’. In (1231a) the compound is singular and in (12-31b) it is marked for the plural number. In both cases the verb carries the object suffix -a.
(12-31) a.wela thare-a
child feed-3.OBJ
‘fostered child’b.wela thare-a
ki
child feed-3.OBJ PL
‘fostered children’560CompoundingBelow are given a few more examples of this type of compound:
(12-32)qota
fasi-a
areca.nut plant-3.OBJ
‘a planted areca-nut tree’, ‘an areca-nut tree that has been planted by
somebody (as opposed to a self-sown tree)’Also with fasi-a:
(12-33)alita
fasi-a
indian.almond plant-3.OBJ
‘variety of the Indian Almond tree (Terminalia sp.) that bears nuts
with large kernels’But not, for example:
(12-34)*alo fasi-a
taro plant-3.OBJ
(‘planted taro’)This is, presumably, because it is normal for taros to be planted. On the
other hand, there is a compound to designate self-sown taros, which are much
less common than planted ones:
(12-35)alo gwee-a
taro pick.up-3.OBJ
‘self-sown taro’ (i.e., taro that is just pulled out from the ground,
without anybody having planted it)(12-36)iqa sule-a
fish fish.with.hook.and.line-3.OBJ
‘species of mackerel’ (lit. ‘fish caught with hook and line’)(12-37)wela suluqi-a
child adopt.at.birth-3.OBJ
‘child adopted at birth because his/her mother died when giving
birth’(12-38)gwa kafo
qoto-a
CLF water
dam-3.OBJ
‘pool in a stream created by means of a dam, barrier’12.4 [verb noun] compounds(12-39)561waqi
fafa-a
basket carry.on.back-3.OBJ
‘backpack’In the compound in (12-40) the modifying verb is short transitive and is
reduplicated:
(12-40)waqi
taa-taru-fi-a
basket RDP-hang-TR-3.OBJ
‘k.o. personal basket carried slung from the shoulder’(The meaning of taru-fi is ‘carry a personal basket, bag suspended on one's
body’; for example, carry a personal basket slung from one's shoulder, or carry
a backpack on one's back.)12.4.","[586, 587, 588, 589, 590]"
"Roo wela qa-da

two child POSS-3PL.PERS 3SG.NFUT die
‘Two of their children died.’ (They had other children.)Similarly, instead of (26-47) further above, where the order inside the possessive noun phrase is [qa-PERS NP], the order could be [NP qa-PERS]:

"The formal propertiesRelative clauses and the presupposition domain of the focus construction receive the same marking, na. Na frequently fuses with immediately following
subject markers whose full forms begin with q, in which case the focus marker
has the form n= and the glottal stop of the subject marker drops out; for example n=e from na qe, with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker qe,
as in (39-7) above.
While there are other parallels between constructions with relative clauses
and the focus construction, especially when it comes to the indexing of the focus constituent in the presupposition domain (see further below), there are also
differences. First, relative clauses are modifiers of nouns. On the other hand,
focused constituents may be not just noun phrases, but also clauses and even a
marker of inter-propositional relations. Second, as noun-phrase internal modifi-39.2 The formal properties1273ers, relative clauses always occur within a higher clause, whereas the clauses in
the presupposition domain need not. The focus construction freely occurs in
simple clauses, without subordination or coordination. And third, even though
na as a focus marker may be omitted (see examples [39-34] and [39-35] below,
this happens only rarely, whereas the relative-clause marking na is absent more
commonly.
The constituent in focus often receives some prosodic prominence, which
falls on its last (or sole) phonological word. The level of stress is somewhat
higher than it would be otherwise, and the word is given higher pitch than it
would receive otherwise. And there may be a slight pause between the end of
the focus constituent and the focus marker.
Noun phrases in focus may be lexical or pronominal. Pronouns are commonly used in the focus position even if the referent is inanimate; see (39-13)
and (39-31) further below, and (6-75) in section 6.3.2.
The phrase, clause, or grammatical element in focus is not a syntactic constituent of the presupposition domain; and, with the exception of verbless
clauses, where the focus phrase is not indexed, the presupposition domain is
grammatically self-contained.
In the discussion that follows, the various structural subtypes of the focusing
construction are discussed and illustrated. Terms such as “subject focusing”,
“direct-object focusing”, etc. are used as convenient shorthand expressions for
“focusing where the constituent in focus corresponds, respectively, to the subject, direct object, etc. of the presupposition clause”.
With two types of exception, noun phrases in focus are indexed in the presupposition domain. One type of exception is verbless sentences. Either the
subject or the predicate phrase can be in focus, but neither is indexed. The other
exception is temporal phrases, which are not normally indexed. Clauses in focus are not indexed either, nor is the marker of inter-propositional relations.
Otherwise, the conditions on the indexing of focused noun phrases in the presupposition clauses are the same as those for the indexing of the positions relativized in relative clauses; see sections 30.6 and 4.9 for detail.
In subject focusing the focus phrase is indexed in the presupposition clause
by means of the appropriate subject marker, if the clause contains a verb. This
is illustrated in (39-4) (and [39-5]) in section 39.1 for lexical focus phrases, and
in (39-8) below for a pronominal focus phrase. As is generally the case when
the referent of a pronoun is foregrounded, pronominal noun phrases in focus
often, although not always, contain the foregrounding particle ni (section 6.3.2).

In (39-9) it is the subject of a verbless sentence that is in focus. There is no

Examples (39-10) – (39-13) illustrate direct-object focusing. The focused
noun phrase is indexed in the presupposition domain by an object suffix or by
an independent personal pronoun, depending on the class of verb, 1 or 2, and on
the grammatical person. In the first two examples, the indexing is by means of
object suffixes:

2SGIn (39-13) below, there is a number mismatch between the pronoun in the
focus phrase and the object suffix on the verb in the presupposition clause. The
pronoun is third person singular. It refers to a musical group mentioned earlier.
The object suffix is plural because of the plurality of the members of the group.
Fula-toqo ‘encounter’ (‘arrive’-TEST), is a Class 2 transitive verb, and so the39.2 The formal properties1275indexing can only be by means of an object suffix, not by means of a personal
pronoun. The sentence involves long-distance focusing, with the noun phrase in
focus and the clause in which it is indexed separated by another clause. Kotho
‘enter’ is an intransitive verb, and its clause does not index the noun phrase in
focus. (For long-distance focusing see further below.)

When an instrument noun phrase is in focus and there is a lexical patient or
theme noun phrase in the presupposition clause, instrument inversion takes
place; see section 10.7 for discussion and examples.
In oblique-object focusing only the noun phrase is in the focus position. The
noun-like and the verb-like prepositions must be stranded behind. (Preposition
stranding need not take place in purpose/reason open interrogatives, with the
preposition uri; section 19.3.4.) With the noun-like prepositions, focus phrases
are indexed by means of personal suffixes:

3SG FOC 1SG.NFUT cook LOC BEN-3SG.PERS

pronouns are not normally used with non-human reference.

"IntroductionNoun phrases may contain one or more postnominal particles that together form
a particle group. For the position of the particle group in a noun phrase see (63) in section 6.1. The particle group may be linked to the preceding element —
the noun or a noun modifier — by means of the ligature ni. Only one instance
of the ligature is possible regardless of the number of particles. However, it is
not common for a particle group to contain more than two particles. A particle
or a combination of particles has the whole noun phrase to its left in its scope.
In (7-1) the noun phrase in the scope of the particle group consists of just a
noun.

‘Yes, (and) they run [here: jog] so that their bodies may become a
little slimmer again (lit.: so that their bodies come back a little).’
Such combined use of the two purpose markers is rare. Unexpectedly, it is
the first one, uri, that carries the object suffix. If uri-a fasi continued an earlier
[verb verb] compound, one would expect the object suffix to appear on the
second element rather than on the first one: *uri fasi-a. (See section 10.5 for
[verb verb] compounds, and section 33.2.1 for the complex reason marker sula
qani-a.) The fact that the object marker occurs on the first component suggests
that the complex purpose marker does not continue an earlier [verb verb] compound and that it developed only after uri and fasi ceased to function as verbs.
Purpose clauses can function as relative clauses modifying nouns. The purpose clause expresses the purpose that the referent of the overall noun phrase
serves/would serve. Here it is normally the purpose marker fasi that is used, not
uri, although the combined form uri-a fasi is possible (see 33-38). Fasi does
not take the object suffix. In (33-34) there are two purpose constructions. The
first one employs a nominalized verb (section 33.3.5). The nominalization is a
complement of the purpose marker uri-a. The second one employs a finite purpose clause. This second purpose construction restates, in a different way, what
is expressed in the first purpose construction, but here it is the marker fasi that
is used. In the finite purpose clause, instrument inversion has taken place (section 10.7).

Relative purpose clauses are also used to modify the subject nouns in grammatically negative existential sentences (section 26.1.2.2). In such cases there is
a strong tendency for the relative marker na not to be used. In (33-36) the variant without the relative marker is preferred.

the verbs with the meanings ‘be ready to do st.’, ‘prepare/make sb. ready to do

There need not be any overt marking of purpose, the purpose relation being
only implied. In some cases the clause that expresses the purpose situation is in
coordination with the preceding clause:

Such absence of purpose marking is particularly common when the first
clause contains the verb lae ‘go’. Since sentences with ‘go’ in the first clause
exhibit other unique properties, such constructions expressing or implying purpose are discussed separately in section 33.3.3.
In (33-46) there is a purpose marker, but it does not have the following
clauses as its complement. This is evident from the fact that it carries the third
person plural object suffix -da, rather than the suffix -a. Here uri functions as a
preposition: ‘for them’. The purpose relation between the first event and the
subsequent events is only implied. The presence of the irrealis marker in the
clauses expressing the desired events shows that the attempt was unsuccessful.

When the main clause contains the verb lae ‘go’, the purpose-clause strategies
discussed thus far can be used, regardless of whether the subjects of the main

However, when the subject of the purpose clause and the subject of the main
clause are identical, the use of the constructions with the subordinators discussed above is not common. Instead, there are several “reduced” strategies that
are available. All of these share the following properties. First, no purpose
marker is present. Second, the two clauses are coordinate with each other,
rather than being in a main-subordinate clause relation. And third, even though1154Reason and purpose clausesthe two clauses are coordinate with each other, when the verb lae immediately
precedes the purpose clause, without any intervening material, the two clauses
are normally said under one intonation contour and without a pause between
them. Strictly speaking, such constructions do not explicitly express purpose.
Rather, the purpose relation between two states of affairs is implied (and inferred). However, for convenience the term “purpose” clause is used here with
reference to the second of two clauses, the one that expresses the state of affairs
which is the implied purpose of the state of affairs expressed in the preceding,
“first” clause.
Examples (33-50) – (33-58) below concern cases where it is only the purpose marker that is absent. As discussed towards the end of section 33.3.2, such
absence of overt purpose marking may also happen with verbs other than ‘go’
in the first clause, but with the verb ‘go’ in the first clause such absence of
overt purpose marking is the norm. What is said in the first part of the discussion that follows applies also to constructions with a verb other than ‘go’ in the
first clause, but the discussion focuses on the verb ‘go’. For a different motion
verb, sifo ‘descend’, see (33-44) in section 33.3.2.
No purpose marking is present in (33-50) and in (33-51). In such cases the
second, purpose clause normally has a future-tense subject marker (but see
further below).

subsequent to the time of going, not necessarily to the time of speech. For example, with respect to (33-51) Bita may have bathed already by the time of the
speech act.
When the purpose is not realized, the irrealis marker sa is used in the purpose clause. In (33-52) the lack of realization of the purpose is signalled, in
addition, by means of the final negative existential clause:33.3 Purpose clauses and nominalizations(33-52)Nau ku

‘I went (lit.: had gone) to the market place to buy (lit.: take) fish, but

The type of construction exemplified above overtly signals only a sequence
of events, but there is a strong implication of a purpose relation. In the situation
expressed in (33-50) above the speaker will go in order to see the man, in the
situation expressed in (33-51) Bita went in order to bathe, and in that expressed
in (33-52) the speaker went to the market in order to buy fish. In all those cases
the subject marker in the second, purpose clause is future-tense. However, it is
possible for a sequential subject marker to be used, rather than a future-tense
one. It is true that in the situation expressed in (33-53) below, the event of
bringing back the shrimp is explicitly encoded only as being subsequent to the
event of going. However, the event of going is not merely incidental to the
event of bringing back the shrimp: the two people went (to the streams) in order to catch shrimp and bring them back to the house.

‘Sometimes they would go and bring (home) shrimp (that were) in

However, in one respect there is a difference between sentences with a future-tense subject marker in the purpose clause and sentences with a sequential
subject marker in the purpose clause. When the state of affairs encoded in the
first clause is in the past, a sequential subject marker serves to signal that the
state of affairs of the purpose clause did eventuate: in the type of situation expressed in (33-53) above, the two people (normally) did (catch and) bring some
shrimp home. It is, of course, possible/likely that their shrimp-catching expeditions were sometimes unsuccessful, but this is not what (33-53) implies. On the
other hand, the use of a future subject marker leaves it open whether the state of
affairs expressed in the purpose clause did indeed obtain or not. For example,1156Reason and purpose clausesin the situation expressed in (33-51) above, Bita may not have bathed after all.
The difference between future-tense and sequential marking in the purpose
clause is also evident in the next pair of examples. In the situation expressed in
(33-54), with a future-tense subject marker, although the speaker may assume
that the addressee did/will buy something, he does not explicitly commit himself/herself to that. On the other hand, in the situation expressed in (33-55),
with a sequential marker, the speaker makes his/her assumption that the addressee did buy something clear.

When the time of the state of affairs expressed in the first clause is present

will eventuate, and here either sequential or future-tense subject marking is
possible without any difference in meaning:

‘... let’s go and hear first what he says to us.’LOCIn saying (33-58) below, the speaker claims to be certain that the event expressed in the purpose clause will take place; nevertheless, he uses the futuretense subject marker rather than the sequential one:

‘I’ll come and see you again next Sunday, without fail (lit.: it will
not not be the case).’
In addition to the absence of a purpose marker, reductions are also common
in the first clause, but only if that clause contains the verb ‘go’. Such reductions
occur, optionally, when nothing intervenes between the verb ‘go’ in the first
clause and the onset of the purpose clause, that is when there are no postverbal
particles or oblique objects in the ‘go’ clause. Commonly, the verb ‘go’ in the
first clause has no subject marker. Subject markers may be omitted in declarative and interrogative sentences with any verb (section 4.8), but in the constructions discussed here such omission is common. This type of reduced construction is not used with reference to past situations where the purpose has been
realized. The purpose clause always has a future-tense subject marker, except
for imperatives, where sequential markers are more common. For imperatives
see further below. The first, ‘go’ clause may contain a subject noun phrase:

father 1SG go 3SG.FUT
‘My father went to work.’ ‘My father went to do some work.’In the three examples above, there is no subject marker in the ‘go’ clause,
but there is a subject noun phrase there. However, quite commonly not only the
subject marker but also the subject is omitted in the ‘go’ clause, provided the
referent is identifiable by other means, such as the subject marker in the following, purpose clause.
Compare (33-59) above, where the verb ‘go’ occurs with a subject pronoun,
and (33-62) below, where the verb ‘go’ has neither a subject marker nor a subject pronoun:

"33.3.2. Positive-purpose clauses
Positive-purpose clauses ([do something] in order that a certain state of affairs
may obtain) can be introduced by uri or by fasi, or, rarely, by the two simultaneously, with uri preceding fasi. Fasi is more common than uri as a purpose
marker (Lichtenberk 1991b). Both uri and fasi can occur with or without the
third person object suffix -a, which indexes the purpose clause. With uri, the
object suffix is much more likely to be present than absent, while with fasi it is
much more likely to be absent than present. The subject marker in a verbal
positive-purpose clause can be either sequential or future, without any appreciable difference in meaning. However, fasi favours sequential marking, while
uri favours future marking.
The first two examples below contain fasi and the subsequent two uri. In
each pair, the subjects of the main and the subordinate clause are different in
the first example, and identical in the second example.

"Although in (4-1) the arrangement of the constituents is given in a simple
linear form, there is layered structure. Other than the verb, all the other constituents are grammatically optional. A verb alone can constitute a verb phrase:
(4-2)Sifo!
descend
‘Come down!’ ‘Go down.’4.1 The basic structure55And a verb phrase can be constituted by a verb and any of the other constituents. The layering within the verb phrase is indicated by means of the
raised roman numerals. A verb phrase type that contains a modifier with a certain numeral is included within a verb phrase type with a modifier with a higher
numeral. For example, a verb phrase that contains a subject marker (superscript
II) and a pronominal direct object (superscript III) has the structure given in (43):
(4-3)[[subject.marker verb] pronominal.direct.object]And a verb phrase that contains the irrealis marker (superscript IX), a subject marker (superscript II), and one or more postverbal particles (superscript
IV) has the structure given in (4-4):
(4-4)[irrealis [[subject.marker verb] postverbal.particle(s)]]For convenience, the verb and the preverbal and the postverbal particles will
be referred to collectively as the “verb complex”. Note that this term is used for
descriptive convenience; it does not identify a syntactic constituent. (The preverbal and the postverbal particles have different superscripts in [4-1].) Direct
objects that are realized by means of independent personal pronouns also are
inside the verb complex. Such objects come directly after the verb, before any
of the postverbal particles. Lexical direct objects, on the other hand, come after
all the postverbal particles and are outside the verb complex. Compare the position of the pronominal object before the perfect and the andative postverbal
particles in (4-5) and the position of the lexical object after these particles in (46). The verb complexes are in square brackets. Both sentences consist solely of
verb phrases. There are no subject noun phrases, the subject being encoded
only by means of the third person plural nonfuture subject marker kera.

"IntroductionToqabaqita has a large variety of types of compounds. On the basis of their
constituents, the following main types can be distinguished in the language:
[noun noun], [noun verb], [verb noun], and [verb verb] compounds. There are
both endocentric and exocentric compounds, and both root and synthetic compounds. With one minor type of exception, all endocentric compounds are leftheaded. Apart from the major compounding types, there are also some minor
types, and also idiosyncratic compounds. And besides compounds, there are
lexicalized phrases, which too are discussed in this chapter.
The only phonological characteristic that may be indicative of a word being
a compound is stress. As discussed in section 2.3, in words with more than one
stressed syllable the final stress tends to be stronger than the preceding
stress(es). So, for example the word alo ‘taro’ would be stressed [apln] when not
in a compound, whereas it would normally receive secondary stress as the first
constituent in the compound [aylnmap'] (alo-mae ‘taro’-‘die’) ‘blight that affects
taro plants’.
The following conventions are employed in writing compounds. Compounds
that are irregular, semantically or formally, are written as one word. Included
here are [verb noun] compounds that are Class 2 transitive verbs. All other
compounds are written as separate words, with one type of exception. Compounds that carry affixes that apply to the compound as a whole are written as
one word to show that the affix applies to the whole compound. This applies to
nominalizations and deverbal nouns formed from compound verbs; for example, abula taqaa (‘behave’ ‘be.bad’) ‘behave badly’, but abula-taqaa-laa ‘behaving badly’, with the nominalizing suffix -laa; and alu wane (‘bury’ ‘person’) ‘bury (dead) people’ but alu-wane-a ‘burial’, with the the deverbal-noun
forming suffix -a. Similarly, compounds that carry other affixes are written as
one word; for example, lofo-qaba-ku (‘inner.side’-‘hand’-1SG.PERS) ‘my (hand)
palm’; cf. the synonymous possessive noun phrase lofo-na qaba-ku ‘the palm of
my hand’ (with the third person possessive suffix -na). Lexicalized phrases are
written as separate words, unless they are highly idiosyncratic semantically
and/or formally.",[580]

coreferential with the subject of the clause in which the nominalization occurs

the presence vs. absence of the limiter construction ba-kuqa. In (33-79) the

hand, with a purpose nominalization, the purpose preposition is required. In

As mentioned in section 33.3.2, some verbs require as their complements
purpose clauses. Some of these verbs are transitive where it is the direct object
that is co-referential with the subject of the purpose clause. Such verbs can take
purpose nominalizations instead. They function as “object-control” verbs: it is
their direct object that corresponds to the notional subject of the nominalization. Kwaathata ‘choose, appoint sb. to do st.’ is one such verb. In (33-86) the
clause with kwaathata functions as a main clause, followed by a purpose
clause, while in (33-87) kwaathata has a purpose nominalization as an oblique
object:

instances of the preposition uri there, one with the allative function and one
with the purpose function. The latter, purpose prepositional phrase functions as
a complement of the purpose nominalization.

Consequence clausesTo express the fact that one state of affairs is the consequence of another state
of affairs, the form adelana is used to introduce the clause that expresses the
consequence. Adelana is a nominalization of the Class 1 transitive verb ade
‘do’, with the third person (singular) personal suffix -na: ade-la-na ‘its doing’,
‘doing of it’. Example (34-1) shows ade as a transitive verb:
(34-1)Taa
n=o
what? FOC=2SG.NFUT
‘What are you doing?’ade-a?
do-3SG.OBJIn its consequence-marking function the nominalization ade-la-na is treated
as an unanalyzed whole: adelana. However, even though adelana has a grammatical function of signalling consequence, it exhibits nominal properties: it
can be placed in focus, and it can be accompanied by certain particles that occur in noun phrases.
As discussed in section 19.3.8, the nominalization ade-la-na is used in one
type of open interrogative to inquire about what led to a certain state of affairs.
There ade-la-na does function as a nominalization: it is the subject of the interrogative predicate ‘be located where?’. There is a close link between the consequence-marking function discussed in this chapter and the function of ade-lana in such interrogatives: ‘How did that come about that such and such is the
case?’. However, in the consequence-marking function, adelana does not function as an argument of a verb.
Grammatically positive consequence clauses normally contain the appropriate sequential subject marker, unless the imperfective subject marker is called
for. Grammatically negative consequence clauses contain the appropriate negative subject marker.
Consequence clauses are normally, but not always (see further below), accompanied by a clause that states the reason for, or the cause of, the consequent
state of affairs. The order of the two clauses may be iconic or non-iconic: reason/cause clause – consequence clause, or consequence clause – reason/cause
clause, respectively. When the clause of reason/cause precedes the consequence
clause, the two clauses are in asyndetic coordination with each other.","[1215, 1216, 1217, 1218, 1219, 1220]"
"14.2.2. In the subject position
In phrasal inclusory constructions in the subject position, the inclusory pronominal and the included NP can occur in in either order; see (14-1) and (14-3)

Phrasal inclusory constructions can also function as the subjects of verbless

1DU(EXCL) PERSMKR Reni one be.born-DVN
‘I and Reni are one and the same family line.’boqo.
ASRTIt is the head, the inclusory pronoun kamareqa ‘we two,’ that sanctions the
presence of the predicate phrase teqe futa-a boqo ‘one and the same family
line.’ If the pronoun were to be omitted, the result would be incongruous, which
is indicated by “#”:
(14-9)#ThaReni teqe futa-a
boqo.
PERSMKR
Reni one be.born-DVN ASRT
#‘Reni is one and the same family line.’On the other hand, the absence of the included NP does not affect the acceptability of the sentence:
(14-10)Kamareqa teqe futa-a
boqo.
1DU(EXCL) one be.born-DVN ASRT
‘The two of us are one and the same family line.’14.2.3. In the direct-object position with Class 1 transitive verbs and in the
oblique-object position with the verb-like prepositions
Class 1 transitive verbs and the verb-like prepositions have object-indexing
suffixes only for the third person. Objects other than third person are encoded
by independent personal pronouns, which are not indexed on the verb or on the
preposition. For simplicity, most of the discussion that follows deals with Class
1 transitive verbs, but the same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the verb-like
prepositions.
When phrasal inclusory constructions function as direct objects of Class 1
transitive verbs and as objects of the verb-like prepositions, the inclusory pronominal and the included NP can occur in either order. Examples (14-11) and
(14-12) illustrate this for Class I transitive verbs, and (14-13) and (14-14) for
the verb-like prepositions:660Constructions with inclusory pronominals(14-11)Wane e

‘The people up there speak badly about my child and me.’
When the inclusory pronominal comes first, there is no object indexing on
the verb or on the preposition ([14-11] and [14-13]), and furthermore, when the
verb is a long transitive one, it takes the -Caqi variant of the transitive suffix, as
in (14-11). This is the situation with pronouns as objects elsewhere. On the
other hand, when the included NP comes first, the verb or the preposition carries the object suffix -a ([14-12] and [14-14]); and when the verb is long transitive, it takes the -Cani variant of the transitive suffix, as in (14-12).
As discussed in section 14.2.1, it is the inclusory pronominal that is the head
in phrasal inclusory constructions. The constructions in (14-11) and (14-13) are
compatible with this, because there it is the inclusory pronominal that determines the absence of the object suffix on the verb or on the preposition. However, the constructions in (14-12) and (14-14) are not compatible with the headedness of phrasal inclusory constructions, because there it is the included NP
that determines the presence of the object suffix.
One possibility is that in object positions the inclusory pronominal and the
included NP do not form a phrase, that it is only the element closer to the verb
that is the object, the other element being an adjunct of some sort. However,
there is evidence that the inclusory pronominal and the included NP do form a
phrase, even in object positions. The evidence comes from constructions with
postverbal particles. Postverbal particles follow pronouns as direct objects and14.2 Phrasal inclusory constructions661precede lexical objects (see [4-1] in section 4.1). When an included NP comes
first and there is a postverbal particle present, the particle comes before the
included NP. In (14-15) the postverbal particle is the perfect marker naqa.

mane
3SG.NFUTlaba-tani-a
naqa maka nau
harm-TR-3.OBJ PRF father 1SGkamareqa.
1DU(EXCL)

However, if the inclusory pronoun comes first, no postverbal particle can be
present, regardless of whether it would come after the pronoun or after the included NP:

PRF(‘The man has harmed me and my father.’)
A postverbal particle must come before a lexical noun phrase object. That
explains the ungrammaticality of (14-17), where the perfect marker comes after
the included NP.
However, in (14-16) the perfect marker comes after the (inclusory) pronoun
and before the included NP, which are the positions in which postverbal particles occur with respect to pronominal and lexical objects. Nevertheless, (14-16)
is ungrammatical. The ungrammaticality of (14-16) is due to the fact that the
postverbal particle comes between the inclusory pronoun and the included NP.
That is, the inclusory pronoun and the included NP do form a phrase.
The presence and absence of object marking on Class 1 transitive verbs and
the verb-like prepositions with phrasal inclusory constructions in the object
positions is determined by a “proximity principle”: it is the constituent that is
closer to the verb or to the preposition that determines whether or not there is662Constructions with inclusory pronominalsobject marking on the verb or on the preposition, regardless of whether that
element is the head of the inclusory construction or not.
The proximity principle is also partially relevant to the positioning of postverbal particles. When it is the included NP that is closer to the verb, postverbal
particles come before it, as they do with lexical objects in general. If it is the
inclusory pronoun that is closer to the verb, postverbal particles should come
directly after it, the way they do with pronominal objects, but that would place
the particles inside the inclusory construction, which would result in ungrammaticality.
The proximity principle is relevant in other cases of inclusory constructions.","[687, 688, 689, 690, 691]"

lexical noun phrase complements with respect to person; and they can function
as a kind of bound pronominal, the only exponent of an argument. In the latter
function, like the independent pronouns, they express both the person and the
number; and they are mutually exclusive with the corresponding independent
pronouns in encoding one and the same participant in a phrase.
One exception to the head-marking pattern is relative clauses. Marking of
the positions relativized takes place inside relative clauses. In (3-22) the position relativized is direct object, and the transitive verb in the relative clause
carries the object suffix -a:

The other exception to the head-marking pattern involves the sole adjective
‘small, little’. The adjective has three different forms, two of which vary depending on the grammatical number of the phrase, singular or plural:

‘these little children’Lexical noun phrases make a singular – plural number distinction. The singular is formally unmarked, while the plural is marked by the particle ki; compare (3-23) and (3-24) above. However, the plural marker is not always present
even if the number is plural. The personal pronouns, the subject markers, the
object suffixes, and the personal suffixes make a three-way number distinction:
singular, dual, and plural. The forms in (3-25) are the third person independent
personal pronouns:
(3-25)a.nia

3PL
‘they (more than two)’Not infrequently, however, with third-person referents when the number of
referents is two, the plural pronoun, subject marker, object suffix, or personal
suffix is used in place of the dual form.
The pronouns, the subject markers, the personal suffixes, and the object
suffixes have inclusive forms in the dual and the plural. The inclusive is not
considered here a first-person form (cf. Daniel [2005]), and so there is no specification of the person in the glosses.5 The forms in (3-26) are the plural personal suffixes:
(3-26)a.thaina-kuluqa
mother-PL(INCL).PERS
‘our mother’b.thaina-miliqa
mother-1PL(EXCL).PERS
‘our mother’3.1 Morphosyntactic patterns49As is the norm among the Oceanic languages, Toqabaqita has more than one
type of possessive construction. The choice between the two constructions is
sensitive to the type of relation between the possessum and the possessor: inalienable vs. alienable, as in (3-27) and (3-28), respectively.
(3-27) thaina-da
mother-3PL.PERS
‘their mother’
(3-28) biqu
kera
house 3PL
‘their house’
However, there are some lexical exceptions, with certain nouns signifying
inalienable relations being treated grammatically the way that nouns that signify alienable relations are, and, furthermore, the notion of individuation of the
possessum also plays a role in the choice of a construction.
At the level of the clause, three types of grammatical relations are distinguished: subject, direct object, and oblique object. Oblique objects can be complements or adjuncts. Oblique objects are headed by prepositions, but the
preposition is sometimes omitted with locative and temporal phrases when its
absence does not result in (significant) loss of information. The allative preposition uri is present with the locative-goal interrogative phrase in (3-29a), but
not in the synonymous (3-29b):

"Purpose clauses and purpose nominalizations33.3.1. Introduction
Several types of purpose construction need to be distinguished in Toqabaqita.
First, there are finite purpose clauses and purpose nominalizations. Second,
there are different markers used with (finite) purpose clauses, partly depending
on whether the purpose is positive or negative. And third, there are special purpose constructions used with the verb lae ‘go’ in the preceding clause.
Purpose clauses are discussed first. Regardless of the type of purpose-clause
construction, the order of the clauses is always iconic: main clause - purpose
clause. The same types of purpose clauses are used regardless of whether the
subjects of the main and the purpose clauses are different or identical.
There are three markers used with purpose clauses: uri, fasi, and ada. Uri is
used only with positive-purpose clauses; fasi is used both with positive-purpose

for all the segments, and for some of them its presence and strength depends on
their position in a word. Velar prenasalization — with /g/, /gdb/ and /w/ — is
always present in normal speech (see below for exceptions), regardless of word
position. /b/ is relatively strongly prenasalized intervocalically, that is wordinternally and when there is no pause between words, but in absolute wordinitial position (after a pause) the prenasalization is often relatively weak. And
/d/ carries relatively strong prenasalization intervocalically, while in absolute
word-initial position the prenasalization tends to be very weak or there is no
prenasalization at all.
Prenasalization is sometimes absent, even when it is otherwise strong, when
speech is directed at someone who is assumed not to know the language (well).
When people speak to babies, they sometimes leave out prenasalization; for
example [gdb7m7] ‘your (sg) head’, rather than [0gdb7m7] (/gdba7-m7/ ‘head2SG.PERS’), and [a:b7] ‘don’t do that’ rather than [a:mb7] (/ab7/ ‘be forbidden,
not allowed’). In the initial stages of my field work on the language, people
would occasionally leave out prenasalization when citing a word to me; for
example, [w!+] rather than [0w!+] ‘basket’, and [k7k7b'] rather than
[k7k7mb'] ‘hop on one leg’.
As discussed in section 2.5, a common feature of Toqabaqita is phonological
fusion of two or even three words, where one or both/all of the words appear(s)
in a reduced form. The protases of conditional sentences are introduced by a
combination of /mada/ ‘or’ and the irrealis marker /sa/ (section 31.1):

‘small number of fish’, ‘few fish’
All these forms are synonymous, except that anga is not normally used with
reference to taros and yams, because there it expresses the numerical value 100
(section 6.8.3). As (6-349) above shows, although the four forms are nouns,
they do trigger the use of the classifiers, unlike the nouns with the numerically
specific value 10 (section 6.8.3).
Below are given two more examples of the quantifying nouns:

have-3SG.OBJ
‘I, I only have little money.’ (Lit.: ‘I, it is only small number of
money/coins that I have.’)
And there are three quantifying elements that exhibit properties of verbs:
talifili, teqefili, and talitoqo, all of which have the meaning ‘only, sole, alone
(without anybody or anything else)’. However, none of these forms can form
the head of a predicate. They are used only in the functions discussed here. Of
the three forms, teqefili is least common. Evidently, it has some historical relation to teqe ‘one’, also ‘sole, only, single’. There are Class 1 transitive verbs fili
‘choose, select, prefer’, ‘appoint, elect’, and tali ‘clear the ground in order to
make a new garden’ in the language, but whether they have any kind of relation
to the quantifiers is not clear. The structure of this type of quantifier phrase is
given in (6-352). The quantifier is the head.","[350, 351]"
"In second-person imperatives, where there is normally no subject marker
present with any verb (section 20.2.1.2), even the verb in the second, purpose
clause may lack a subject marker:

go see-3.OBJ saucepan that
‘Go see [here: check] the saucepan.’ (Is it boiling now?)Alternatively, the purpose clause may have the sequential subject marker:

thamataqi.
prepare.sleeping.place
go 2SG.SEQ
‘Go (and) get the sleeping place/bed ready.’In the absence of a purpose marker, a purpose relation between states of
affair is only implied (and inferred). And clearly, the relation between an event
of going expressed in one clause and the event expressed in the immediately
following clause need not be one of purpose. In (33-70) below, the verb ‘go’ in
the first clause has neither a subject marker nor a subject phrase, but the events
expressed in the two clauses are in a simple temporal sequence, not in a purpose relation. In the overall situation, the speaker did not go in order to see the
pool, because he did not even know at the outset that he was going to see a
pool.",[1212]

"4.2.2.2. Intransitive verbs formed by reduplication
A relatively small number of intransitive verbs are formed by reduplication of
the base that occurs in the corresponding transitive verb. If the transitive verb
has a transitive suffix, the suffix is absent from the intransitive form; see (c)-(f)
in (4-25). In a few cases, there is a change in the last vowel of the base; see (d).

directional, which is part of the verb phrase, instead of cliticizing to the following element, which is what often happens elsewhere (see the discussion of this
preposition further above in this section):
(2-82)/la' ka7 !+
sa-na/
go AND LOC ADJC-3SG.PERS
‘Go to him.’/la' ka=+ sa-na/The subject markers that begin with a glottal stop fuse with the preceding
word, and the glottal stop is deleted. These subject markers often fuse with the
relative-clause marker, the focus marker, and the complementizer /na/:

PERSMKR who?
FOC=3SG.NFUT
‘Who did you see?’r+k+-a/
see-3SG.OBJAmong the subject markers that begin with a glottal stop, it is the third person singular nonfuture tense one that most frequently, and commonly, fuses
with the preceding element. In the next two examples it fuses, respectively,
with a nominalization in the subject position and with a demonstrative as the
last element of the subject phrase:
(2-85)/0ata-la-na
!'
ma7l+-!a/
speak-NMLZ-3SG.PERS 3SG.NFUT be.on.left.side-PROP
‘He spoke in a clumsy, non-fluent, non-idiomatic way.’
with fusion: /0ata-la-n=' ma7l+-!a/38PhonologyIn (2-86) two geminate vowels disappear in fusion. This is the only type of
case when two syllables are deleted, although it is possible for only the last
vowel to be deleted.
(2-86)/dnn
!nrn
baa !'
makdpa/
thing
be.many that 3SG.NFUT smell
‘Those many things smelled.’
with fusion: /dnn !nrn b=' makdpa/And in (2-87) the third person nonfuture subject marker has fused with
/mada/, which is a conjunction ‘or’ and also serves to signal less than full certainty on the part of the speaker about the factual status of a proposition:
(2-87)/mada !'
mata!+/
/mad=' mata!+/
or
3SG.NFUT be.sick
‘He might be sick.’ ‘Is he perhaps sick?’Similarly, the general locative preposition /!+/ loses its glottal stop when it
fuses with the preceding element; see (2-77) and (2-82) further above, and (289) further below.
Fusion may take place when one word begins with a consonant that is identical to the consonant in the last syllable of the preceding word. The final vowel
of the first word is deleted and the two identical consonants are realized as one
long one:
(2-88)/maka kam+l+!a/
father 1PL(EXCL)
‘our father(s)’
with fusion: /mak=kam+l+!a/
father =1PL(EXCL)[mák:ym+l+p!]See examples (2-16a) – (2-16c) in section 2.2.1.
Fusion may result in the elision of a morpheme. Only monosyllabic suffixes
are elided through fusion. The third person singular object suffixes /-a/ and
/-na/ and the third person singular personal suffix /-na/ may be elided when the
word they are part of fuses with the following word. Although the morpheme
has been elided, its notional presence is indicated in the morphemic glosses.
The gloss for the elided morpheme is joined to the preceding one by means of a
colon. In (2-89) the locative preposition /!+/ has fused with the preceding transitive verb, and the object-indexing suffix has been elided:2.6 Orthographic conventions(2-89)/mnrn

"More on conjunctive coordination of lexical and pronominal noun
phrasesLexical and pronominal noun phrases are freely coordinated in a non-argument
position, such as the topic position, and the two types of coordinand can occur
in either order.

This type of coordination is also possible in the subject position, but it is
relatively rare there:

PLmili
1PL(EXCL).NFUTtoo
siafaqa.
be.in.certain.condition not.be.well.off
‘I and my children are not well off.’
However, the situation is quite different in non-topic and non-subject positions. The discussion that follows focuses on the direct-object position, but
brief remarks will subsequently be made about other positions. The sentences
in (11-24) and (11-25) appear to contain coordinate noun phrases in the direct-11.2 Noun-phrase coordination543object position, the former having the lexical noun phrase before the personal
pronoun and the latter the personal pronoun before the lexical noun phrase:
(11-24)Wane

e
laba-taqi nau
1SG
man
3SG.NFUT harm-TR
‘The man harmed me and my father.’ma
andmaka
fathernau.
1SGIn (11-24), with the lexical phrase next to the verb ‘harm’, the verb carries
the suffix -a, which indexes lexical direct objects, and the form of the verb is
laba-tani. On the other hand, in (11-25), with a pronominal phrase next to the
verb, the verb does not carry the object suffix and its form is laba-taqi. Labatani/laba-taqi ‘harm’ is a long transitive verb, and such verbs exhibit alternation in the form of the (long) transitive suffix: with one type of exception that is
not relevant here, -Cani is used in the presence of an object suffix and -Caqi is
used elsewhere, including with pronominal objects (section 4.2.3.2.2).
One might want to argue that the presence or absence of the object suffix
and consequently the form of the verb work on a “proximity” principle, that it
is the coordinand closer to the verb that is the determining factor. However,
there is evidence that that is not the case. As shown in (4-1) in section 4.1, pronominal direct objects and lexical direct objects occupy different positions in
the verb phrase: pronominal objects occur directly after the verb, before any
postverbal particles, while lexical objects occur after all of the postverbal particles. What happens if a postverbal particle is inserted into sentences such as
(11-24) and (11-25) above? The sentences in (11-26) and (11-27) below contain
the perfect marker naqa. The sentence in (11-26) corresponds to (11-24), with
the lexical noun phrase coming first:
(11-26)Wane
man
nie
3SG.NFUTlaba-tani-a
naqa maka nau
harm-TR-3.OBJ PRF father 1SGnau.
PROFORE
1SG
‘The man has harmed my father and me.’ma
and544Coordination and apposition of NPs and PPsIn (11-26) the perfect marker comes before the lexical noun phrase, which is
the situation with lexical direct objects. However, the perfect marker also precedes the pronominal phrase, which is not what happens with pronominal objects elsewhere.
The sentence in (11-27) corresponds to (11-25), with the pronominal noun
phrase coming first:
(11-27)Wane
mane
3SG.NFUTlaba-taqi
harm-TRnau
1SGnaqa ma
PRF andmaka
fathernau.
1SG
‘The man has harmed me and my father.’
The perfect marker comes after the pronoun, which is what one would expect, but it is placed between the pronoun and the lexical noun phrase. Both
types of problem, the one exemplified in (11-26), where a postverbal particle
comes earlier than the pronoun, and the one exemplified in (11-27), where a
postverbal particle intervenes between the pronoun and the lexical noun phrase,
are evidence that the pronoun and the lexical noun phrase do not form a coordinate noun phrase with each other. Only the first noun phrase is the direct object. This accounts for the presence and absence of the object suffix on the verb
and the -tani/-taqi variation in the form of the transitive suffix. The second
noun phrase is a clause-level adjunct: ‘The man has harmed my father, and/as
well as me’ for (11-26), and ‘The man has harmed me, and/as well as my father’ for (11-27). Similarly for (11-24) and (11-25). (For more detailed discussion in the context of direct objecthood in Toqabaqita and for another example
see Lichtenberk [1997].)
The next pair of examples shows a parallel situation with a verb-like preposition. In (11-28) the lexical noun phrase occurs next to the prolative preposition and is indexed on it by means of the suffix -a, as is the case with lexical
objects of the verb-like prepositions (section 10.3.1):
(11-28)Toqa
peoplenaqi ki kera
this PL 3PL.NFUTngat=taqaa
suli-a
speak=be.bad PROL-3.OBJmak=kamuluqa ma ni
kamuluqa.
and PROFORE 2PL
father=2PL
‘These people speak badly about your father and (about) you.’
On the other hand, in (11-29) it is the pronoun that occurs next to the preposition, and as is the case with pronominal objects, it is not indexed on the11.2 Noun-phrase coordination545preposition. (In 11-29 there is no phonological fusion of the verbs ngata
‘speak’ and taqaa ‘be bad’.)
(11-29)Toqa
peoplenaqi ki kera
this PL 3PL.NFUTngata
speaktaqaa
be.badsuli
PROLkamuluqa ma mak=kamuluqa.
and father=2PL
2PL
‘These people speak badly about you and (about) your father.’
Here too the presence and absence of object indexing on the preposition is
evidence that it is only the phrase next to the preposition that is its object. The
other one is an adjunct.
While the second noun phrase in the constructions discussed in this section
is an adjunct, there is not necessarily a prosodic break between the two noun
phrases. Sometimes, however, there is a (slight) pause between the two, as in
the next example. In fact, in that sentence there are two adjunct phrases, and
each one contains a combination of the additive marker and an intensifier. Each
adjunct is separated from the preceding phrase by a pause, indicated by commas.

INTSCoordination of lexical and pronominal noun phrases in a non-argument
position is not unusual. It is grammatical in the subject position but not common. Coordination of lexical and pronominal noun phrases in other positions is
not grammatical. Instead, only one noun phrase functions as the object of the
verb or of a preposition, the other one(s) being (an) adjunct(s). This type of
construction is dispreferred. What is preferred both in the subject position and
in the object positions is constructions with inclusory pronominals, which are
discussed in chapter 14.","[571, 572, 573, 574]"
"Second-person singular imperativesThe commonest way to form a second-person singular imperative is for there to
be no subject marker with the verb:

"Direct speech is not necessarily direct quotationBefore considering the means that serve to express direct speech, one note of
clarification is in order. So-called direct speech does not necessarily reproduce
verbatim another person’s speech. Not infrequently, it reproduces just the content or the gist of what the other person said, rather than the exact words. For
example, as pointed out by Haiman (1985), what was originally said may have
been delivered in a language other than that used to report it in a direct speech.
This is illustrated in the next two examples. In the first one, what the direct
speech is presented as reporting is what an American officer had allegedly said
to one or more representatives of the British colonial government in Honiara
sometime in the 1940s. It is a safe assumption that the language used was not

express not what was said, but what is expected or predicted to be said, what

"The preverbal particles5.1.1. Introduction
The preverbal particles occur between a subject marker and the verb; see (4-1)
in the preceding chapter. Only one preverbal particle ever occurs in a clause.
The particles are listed in table 5.1 in the order in which they will be discussed:

the other preverbal particles in one respect: unlike the other particles, they have
synonymous verbal counterparts. They are included among the preverbal particles, but discussion of these three elements is postponed until section 29.5,
where their status as particles is considered in detail.
The inceptive and the desiderative markers optionally contain the detransitivizing suffix (section 4.6) in its form -qi. One of the immediate-5.1 The preverbal particles165past/immediate-future markers, one of the attenuative markers and some of the
restrictive markers end in -qe, which historically comes from the -qe variant of
the detransitivizing suffix. It is possible that the ineffectuality marker marungeqe and the immediate-past/immediate-future marker biqi were also originally formed by means of the detransitivizing suffix, but there is no evidence of
related suffixless forms. The inceptive markers thafali-qi and thafali, and the
desiderative markers thathami-qi and thathami have related verbal counterparts
in the present-day language, and the suffix is identified in glosses: thafali-qi,
thathami-qi. None of the other forms that contain reflexes of the detransitivizing suffix have related verbal (or other) counterparts, and they are treated here
as unanalyzed wholes. Some of the restrictive particles are reduplications,
which would be consistent with verbal origins.","[193, 194]"
"The functionsThe basic structure of the pronominal noun phrase is given in (6-66):
(6-66)NPÆ(pronominal.foregrounder) PRONOUN
(‘one’)
(particle complex)(relative clause)The pronominal foregrounder and the numeral ‘one’ form the innermost
layer with the head pronoun. The modifiers to the right of the head, that is the
particle complex and relative clauses, form subsequent layers.
All of the various modifiers are discussed in the relevant places, and here
only brief examples are given:

With some systematic exceptions, the pronominal noun phrases are used in
positions in which lexical noun phrases occur. They cannot occur in conjunction with the personal suffixes or the object-indexing suffixes in a phrase to
index the same participant. On the other hand, they freely cooccur in subject
position with the subject markers. They may be coreferential with another noun
phrase in the clause. In (6-70) there are two instances of a pronoun in the direct-object position, coreferential with the subjects of the two clauses:

REST ASRT‘… but the ancestral spirit had changed herself and disguised herself
back as a girl.’ ‘… but the ancestral spirit had changed herself and
had made herself look again like a girl.’
The pronouns, including the third person pronouns, are used primarily with
human reference, and with reference to ancestral spirits and ogres.

For an example of a pronoun referring to an ancestral spirit see (6-70)
above.
Less frequently, the pronouns are used to refer to animals (other than in
traditional stories, where animals often behave in ways otherwise characteristic
of humans), and to inanimate objects. Such usage is somewhat restricted and
occurs in particular in subject position. And it is more common with nonhuman entities that are in view and can be pointed at:246The noun phrase(6-72)Nia e

3SG 3SG.NFUT one-side-PROP NPAST.HERE
‘It is lopsided, not symmetrical.’ (The object is near the speaker.)However, the pronouns are commonly used with non-human, even inanimate
reference as resumptive pro-forms in subject topicalization and in the focus
position. In (6-74) the pronoun functions resumptively in topicalization:

plants and other relatively small plants without trunks or woody6.3 The independent personal pronouns247stems. At the ululu kwasi mortuary feast the dancers can hold any
kind of branch or leaves in their hands while dancing.)
The third person singular pronoun is used in a verbless closing formula:
(6-76)Nia bo=naqa neri.
3SG ASRT=PRF NPAST.HERE
‘That’s all (I have to say).’ ‘That’s it.’ ‘That’s the way it is/was.’While the personal pronouns cannot cooccur with the personal suffixes or
the object-indexing suffixes in a phrase to index the same participant, they
freely cooccur in subject position with the subject markers (apart from the
homophonic clash with the inclusive forms mentioned in the previous section).
Sometimes this happens when the subject noun phrase is foregrounded:

‘This man is ready to go, (and) I will go with him.’
PRFPROFOREHowever, the personal pronouns are also commonly used when the subject
is not foregrounded. For example, in (6-78) the speaker simply announces that
he and another person are about to leave. There is no foregrounding, no implication of contrast:
(6-78)Kamareqa mere
1DU(EXCL) 1DU(EXCL).NFUT
‘We’re going now.’lae

PRFSimilarly in (6-79) there is no foregrounding of the subject. In fact, there it
is a temporal phrase that has been foregrounded, by topicalization:

In order to foreground a pronoun, the same topicalization and focusing
strategies are used as with lexical noun phrases (chapters 38 and 39, respectively). However, relatively weak foregrounding is achieved by means of the
pronominal foregrounder ni, which directly precedes the pronoun.

The pronominal foregrounder is normally not used in positions other than
subject, unless the noun phrase is foregrounded in some way and does not occur in situ. In (6-83) it is used with the fronted, contrastively topicalized second
person singular pronoun that corresponds to the direct object. However, as the
second clause shows, the foregrounder is not obligatory when a pronoun is
fronted:6.3 The independent personal pronouns(6-83)Ni

ASRTIn (6-84) the pronoun with the foregrounder is not a direct object, even
though it does encode the person seen. Rather, it is an adjunct at the clause
level (section 11.2.1.3), and so the foregrounder can be used.

PROFOREThe inclusive pronouns can be used integratively: an inclusive pronoun is
used to include the addressee as if he/she were part of the speaker’s group
when, objectively, he or she is not (see also section 4.10). In (6-85) the speaker
uses the inclusive pronoun indexically to express personal closeness. Personal
baskets, waqi, are strictly personal property, but the speaker speaks of the addressee’s basket in a jocular way as if it were theirs jointly.

For another example of the integrative use of a pronoun see (4-283) in section 4.10.
As mentioned in section 6.3.1, there are special plural pronominal forms
which were characteristic of women’s speech in earlier times. These pronouns
are not normally used today, with one exception. The inclusive pronoun kia is
used in the expression fanu kia ‘our home, our country’ (fanu ‘home, one’s
home place’). It is used both by women and by men, especially when away
from one’s home area.","[273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278]"
"3.2 Word classes53Classifiers. Some have broad ranges of use; others are restricted. Not all
nouns take classifiers.
Person markers. They make a masculine – feminine distinction.
Coordinators. Some, but not all, can conjoin both phrases and clauses.
Subordinators.
Particles. This is a heterogeneous category, which subsumes all the grammatical elements not included in the other classes.
Ligature.
Interjections.
There is a fair amount of heterosemy (Lichtenberk 1991a) in the language,
with forms representing one and the same etymon belonging in different word
classes. For example, there is a form that functions as an intransitive verb ‘end,
finish; be finished’, as a completive/exhaustive particle in verb phrases, as an
exhaustive particle in noun phrases, as a sequencing particle, and as an adversative coordinator. Another form functions as a comitative preposition and as a
noun-phrase coordinator, and, rarely, as a clause coordinator. There is also a
high degree of grammatical polysemy, with one and the same grammatical element (a member of one word class) having more than one function.","[81, 82]"
"20.4.2. Immediate imperatives
Immediate imperatives are imperatives used when the speaker expects the state
of affairs to be brought about immediately, or to be discontinued immediately.
Immediate imperatives employ the perfect marker naqa (section 15.3), which is
also used to express immediate future (section 15.1.2.2). The perfect marker is
used both in positive and in negative imperatives. In positive imperatives it is
used regardless of the type of the subject marker present, and also when there is
no subject marker.

imperative the perfect marker signals that the addressees should no longer engage in the activity, effective immediately.",[909]
"IntroductionImperative sentences serve to express various kinds of directives (Lyons 1977;
Searle 1979, 1983), such as orders, commands, demands, requests, advice, instructions, exhortations, persuasions, incitements, and invitations (Hamblin
1987). Most commonly, imperatives are used to get the addressee or addressees
to do something, but they may be directed at individuals other than the addresee(s): at a third person or at the speaker himself/herself. This chapter is concerned with clausal structures, imperatives, that function to express various
kinds of directives. In the present context the term “imperative” is used only
with reference to clauses that function as main clauses, not to clauses embedded under higher verbs that signal the illocutionary force; that is, with reference
to sentences such as the one in (20-1), but not sentences such as the one in (202).

‘I want you to help me.’Toqabaqita has a variety of grammatical means to form imperatives. However, as will be seen in what follows, in almost all cases the grammatical elements used to form imperatives have other functions as well. These include the
subject markers: nonfuture, future, sequential, negative, dehortative, and, in two
cases, imperative. In the discussion that follows, a basic division is made between positive and negative imperatives, and within both categories various
subtypes are distinguished.
Imperatives are normally directed at people, but they may be directed at
other entities as well. By using (20-3) the speaker is sicking a dog:20.2 Positive imperatives(20-3)843Tari-a!

in section 20.2.3.","[895, 896]"
"Word classesThe following are the word classes in Toqabaqita:
OPEN LEXICAL CLASSES:Nouns and verbs. Both readily accept new members, including borrowings
from Solomon Islands Pijin. However, most borrowing from Pijin involves
nouns.
CLOSED LEXICAL CLASSES:Adjective. The class consists of one member, whose meaning is ‘small, little.’ The adjective has three different forms, whose use is determined partly by
grammatical number, partly by the animacy status of the noun phrase, and
partly by the count vs. mass status of the noun phrase.
Adverbs. The number of adverbs is small, and they do not share any morphological property.
Cardinal numerals. The numeral system is decimal. There is also a set of
forms with an ordinal-numeral function. Those are morphologically based on
the cardinal numerals, but they are a subtype of nouns.
GRAMMATICAL CLASSES:
Prepositions. Some may take both non-clausal and clausal complements.
Independent personal pronouns. The categories that are distinguished are:
first, second, and third person; inclusive; singular, dual, and plural number.
Pro-sentence forms.
Locative pro-form.
Subject markers. They make the same person, number, and clusivity distinctions that the independent pronouns make, and simultaneously mark tense or
aspect (nonfuture tense, future tense/imperfective aspect), sequentiality, negation, or dehortation.
Demonstratives.
Quantifiers.",[81]
