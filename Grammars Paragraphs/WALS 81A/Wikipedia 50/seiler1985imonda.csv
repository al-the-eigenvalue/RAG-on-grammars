"8.2.3.3The counterfactual s u f f i x - tIn 5.3.6.1 the counterfactual s u f f i x -t i s discussed i n some detail.
I t may
be glossed with the English modal verbs 'would8, 'should' and ' c o u l d v . For
a discussion I r e f e r t o 5.3.6.1 and give here just an i l l u s t r a t i v e example:
(53)5mha-pia -tyesterday MO-come-CF
you should have come yesterday8.3Word orderThe order o f elements within the N P and the clause i s f a i r l y f l e x i b l e .
There
axe more constraints on the order o f constituents o f the N P , a matter which i s
As far as clause constituent order i s concerned,
discussed i n chapter 4 .
there i s only one constraint, namely the requirement for the verb t o occur i n
final position.
The order o f the other constituents does not a f f e c t the
grammaticality o f the clause.
However, d i f f e r e n t orderings have d i f f e r e n t
pragmatic e f f e c t s . As t h i s i s an area I have not thoroughly investigated, I
shall merely give a few examples which i l l u s t r a t e the f l e x i b i l i t y i n the order
o f constituents, taking i n t o account only adverb, subject, object and
r e c i p i e n t h e n e factive :
(54)SU-OB:
ka p a f e i a suefe-i1 stone fire do-IMM
I am going t o make a fire ( f o r cooking)h here i s another strategy t o express i n a b i l i t y the exact nature and extent o f
which I do not f u l l y understand at present.
This strategy involves
interrogative pronouns or adverbials ( 3 . 6 . 3 1 , some o f which trigger the
pro-verb f e ( 5 - 4 . 5 ) . Here are some i l l u s t r a t i v e examples :

While I am n o t saying anything on t h e pragmatic impact of d i f f e r e n t c o n s t i t u e n t
o r d e r i n g s , t h e r e a r e nonetheless two s t r a t e g i e s t h a t deserve a s p e c i a l mention.

What I term the D-form has several functions one of which i s i t s use i n
t a l k i n g t o someone a t a distance, hence i t s name.
I t consists of a mid vowel
of e i t h e r height two o r t h r e e , [+/- back 1, which may be suffixed t o any p a r t of
speech, including p a r t i c l e s .
I f it occurs with a verb it must occupy t h e l a s t
position i n the VP.
The name giving function of the D-form may be seen i n the
following example :
(63)ha-pia -u -A
MO-come-IMP-D
come !","[185, 186, 187]"

However, i f
d i r e c t i o n a l aspect of t h e h i t t i n g of t h e t r e e with an axe.
someone were t o h i t t h e t r e e i n order t o check t h e blade of t h e axe, then t h e
noun would be marked.
That -m marks t h e d i r e c t i o n a l aspect of t h e action may
become c l e a r e r i n the following example:

Here again t h e d i r e c t i o n a l a s p e c t of t h e shooting i s of no importance and t h e
speaker simply t e l l s us t h a t he has k i l l e d a l o t of cassowaries.
However,
someone might examine a cassowary t h a t has j u s t been s h o t by someone e l s e and
upon seeing a s c a r , i n d i c a t i n g an e a r l i e r shotwound, he might exclaim:(125) 5 h - n & i koi-rnncrnotkau5l-sabeha -ncassowary -GL e a r l i e r 1 shoot-in vain-PST

To f u r t h e r i l l u s t r a t e t h e d i r e c t i o n a l f u n c t i o n o f -rn h e r e i s another example:(128) f g t h eposground dig

That t h e -rn marked NP i s i n f a c t an o b j e c t and n o t an oblique goal N P is

DISAMBIGUATION
The goal marker -m a l s o serves t h e purpose of disambiguation.
Ambiguity i s
most l i k e l y i n case of i n t e r a c t i o n of two NPs whose r e f e r e n t s are [ +~uman].
In order t o f o r e s t a l l any misunderstanding a s t o which i s subject and which i s
o b j e c t , Imonda marks a l l [ + ~ u m a n ]o b j e c t s with -m.
Note t h e c o n t r a s t between

Whether t h e occurrence of -m i n cases l i k e t h i s 'snake example' should be
viewed a s disambiguation i s questionable, a s r e a l world knowledge makes doubt

"1.5.1 A note on the use of glosses
The problem of choosing appropriate glosses for morphemes is a thorny one and
the solution adopted in this grammar may not be the best one.
Where a given
morpheme fulfils one function or a few very closely related functions, there
is no problem and we may use a consistent gloss.
Thus, the verbal prefix eis simply a subject number marker (dual) and never performs another function.
Often, however, what is clearly one and the same morpheme has various functions
and the question arises whether we should use different glosses accordingly.
If we do so in principle, then the further question is how different the
This is
individual functions have to be for us to choose different glosses.
where the difficulty lies.
Thus, the verbal suffix -na agrees with benefactives and possessors and these two functions could arguably be indicated by
different glosses.
On the other hand, the case marker -m has a host of
functions (7.3) the central one of which is that of goal marker.
Other
functions are more or less closely related to the one of goal marking and there
seems to be no non-arbitrary cut-off point for introducing new glosses. Besides
goal, -m marks recipients and benefactives, which may be regarded as goals,
objects that actually are goals, but it also functions as a disambiguator,
marking all [+~uman]objects.
It seems best to use just one gloss for all
these cases.
This has the additional advantage that we do not have to invent
glosses for those occurrences of -m where its function is entirely opaque (for
examples see chapter 7).
Therefore, one gloss is normally used for a given morpheme throughout this
grammar. Where this results in total obscurity, the reader is referred to the
index, which provides references to the appropriate places, where the functions
of these morphemes are discussed. Occasionally, and possibly inconsistently, I
have abandoned the principle of 'one gloss per morpheme'. Thus, the goal marker
sometimes substitutes for the locative marker and in this function it is
glossed accordingly (i.e. LQC); or the suffix - i a has the two distinct
functions of marking location and cause and it is glossed according to itsp a r t i c u l a r f u n c t i o n a s e i t h e r UX: o r CAU.
Apart from such minor exceptions,
however, t h e p r i n c i p l e of 'one g l o s s p e r morpheme' has been maintained
throughout t h i s grammar.","[13, 14]"
"systematic analysis of discourse is outside the scope of this grammar.
However, certain phenomena of grammar cut across the traditionally strict
division between sentence and discourse level.
Thus, topicalised clauses
have 'sentential' and 'discourse' functions -anda complete account of this
phenomenon cannot be given without appealing to discourse.
Topic clauses
with sentential functions are contrastive topics and correspond to adverbial
clauses in English.
Those with discourse function are resumptive topics.
They 'summarise' the information contained in the previous clause and present
it as a topic, that is, as a framework against which the subsequent clause
needs to be interpreted. These resumptive topics simply provide a backreference to the preceding clause, provide discourse cohesion and cannot be
said to be subordinate to the following clause.
This pattern is well known
from Philippine languages (also from New Guinea languages).
AFormally, topic clauses are marked by a suffix on the verb.
The same suffix
may also mark adverbial and NP 'topics,both clause-internal and clauseexternal topics.
Topic marking might therefore be described at least at
three different levels, namely clause, sentence and discourse.
However, what
is clearly one and the same phenomenon needs to be given a unified treatment
and this is provided in chapter 9.","[12, 13]"

"2.3.2.4High vowel centralisingIn addition to the vowels so far discussed there are two others, namely two
high, mid, rounded and unrounded vowels, whose status within the phonemic
system is problematic.
These vowels are largely confined to 0, the corresponding vowels for Y being the high, unrounded front or rounded back vowels.
Auditorily, the difference between the centralised and the non-centralised
variants is quite marked and seems bigger than between certain other vowels in
the system such as /a/ and /S/.
It appears to be impossible to specify a
conditioning environment for the occurrence of the central vowels.
Here are some examples:

pig chaseThe feature of high central vowels is one of many that is associated with
adulthood.
It is acquired fairly late in life, sometime during adolescence.
Young boys never have it but on approaching adulthood they start acquiring this
feature.
As is to be expected, this acquisition is a slow process, starting
with some items and then gradually spreading to all relevant ones. Furthermore,
adolescents do not necessarily start with the same items and a fair bit of
variation has been observed (no worthwhile data are at hand for women).
The
following anecdote shows that the high vowel variation may not be entirely
confined to the subconscious level: a young man was asked to give the equivalent of the English t r e e .
Spontaneously, he volunteered t i with a clear high
However, after a few moment's reflection he offered

the following comment: ""Well, [ t i ] does not sound too good, it should be [ t i I"".
In order to shed more light on the social correlate of the high central vowels,
more statistical material would be required than I collected; therefore, I
leave the discussion at these few remarks.

function t h a t i s discussed i n d e t a i l i s t h a t of t o p i c marking.

P a r t of chapter 7 i s devoted t o the question of whether c e r t a i n types of NPs
might have a s p e c i f i c s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n t o the predicate.
The conclusion
reached t h e r e i s t h a t we can s i n g l e o u t t h e s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n s of subject
and object.
These a r e t h e core N P s of the clause which a r e s y n t a c t i c a l l y

"HAIMAN'S POSITION
Haiman invokes t h e notion of universal morphology, by which he means t h a t
"" s i m i l a r i t i e s of form a r e r e f l e c t i o n s of underlying s i m i l a r i t i e s of meaning""
(Haiman 1978:586).
I n Hua, a Highlands language of Papua New Guinea, he notes
morphological s i m i l a r i t i e s between t h e marking of t o p i c and t h a t of t h e
p r o t a s i s i n conditional constructions.
H i s p r i n c i p l e of universal morphology
would suggest t h a t t o p i c marking and t h e p r o t a s i s have something i n common.

Topic thus defined would indeed seem t o
c h a r a c t e r i s e conditional clauses as well as t h e more t r a d i t i o n a l t o p i c .

However,
t h a t it would a l s o c h a r a c t e r i s e t h e above discussed ' a s f o r ' cases.

of o t h e r clauses, as I w i l l f u r t h e r discuss below.
D I K ' S POSITION
A d e f i n i t i o n of t o p i c t h a t is broader than t h e t r a d i t i o n a l one seems a l s oJapanese has t h e
c a l l e d f o r t o cover c e r t a i n much discussed phenomena.

While t h e t r a d i t i o n a l d e f i n i t i o n of t o p i c would be t o o r e s t r i c t i v e t o handle
examples of t h i s s o r t , Haiman's would be broad enough.
However, Dik o p t s f o r
a different solution.
He introduces t h e term theme t o cover example (23) ,
maintaining t o p i c f o r example ( 2 2 ) .
Dik proposes t h e following sentence
schema :(Theme) , Predication, ( T a i l )
clause) , preceded by an optional
theme and followed by an optional t a i l .
While t h e t a i l covers cases of
c l a r i f y i n g afterthought character, t h e theme covers t h e l e f t - d i s l o c a t i o n and
t o p i c a l i s a t i o n s t r a t e g i e s , i . e . those s t r a t e g i e s t h a t have scene s e t t i n g

Both theme and t a i l a r e linked t o the predication by way of t h e
p r i n c i p l e of relevance.
So, f o r instance, a speaker confronted with:
' a s f o r Joan's lover, I had s p a g h e t t i on t o a s t again l a s t night' would t r y and
unravel the connection between t h e theme and t h e predication, n a t u r a l l y
assuming t h a t t h e speaker intends t h e theme t o be relevant i n t h e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of t h e predication.

F i n a l l y , the t h i r d category c o n s i s t s of
those languages which have a s p e c i a l dative case f o r the 10; Latin can serve

Given t h e d i f f e r e n c e s i n behaviour of the NPs
functioning a s '10s' it i s q u i t e f u t i l e t o attempt a universal d e f i n i t i o n of
10.
Of course it i s always possible t o define it semantically ( r e c i p i e n t ,
benefactive) but t h i s i s without s y n t a c t i c consequences..
Leaving now t h e discussion of t h e f e a s i b i l i t y of a universally s i g n i f i c a n t
Is t h e r e
category ' I O ' , what i s t h e language s p e c i f i c s i t u a t i o n i n Imonda?
a s y n t a c t i c a l l y definable category of IO?
I t appears t h a t NPs whose
r e f e r e n t s a r e r e c i p i e n t s o r b e n e f i c i a r i e s p a t t e r n l i k e peripheral NPs but a l s o
have some core NP properties.
There i s c l e a r l y no j u s t i f i a b l e s y n t a c t i c
r e l a t i o n of I 0 i n t h e language.
Let us now see how t h e s y n t a c t i c handling of
t h e prime candidates f o r I 0 s t a t u s , namely r e c i p i e n t and beneficiary, compares
with t h a t of t h e core and p e r i p h e r a l NPs.
In chapter 4 we have seen t h a t case
marking s i g n a l s the semantic function of peripheral NPs and t h a t these
p e r i p h e r a l NPs do not stand i n a p a r t i c u l a r s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n t o t h e
predicate.
Furthermore, none of those p e r i p h e r a l NPs i s cross-referenced on
the verb.
This i s i n c o n t r a s t t o t h e two core NPs, s u b j e c t and o b j e c t , which
a r e cross-referenced on t h e verb f o r non-singular number and a r e not case
marked, i n t h e case of s u b j e c t , o r ' o p t i o n a l l y ' s o i n the case of object.
AS
pointed out, t h e semantic function of t h e two core NPs i s dependent on t h e verb
and not indicated by morphosyntactic means.
Core and p e r i p h e r a l NPs are
t h e r e f o r e c l e a r l y d i s t i n c t i n a number of ways.
