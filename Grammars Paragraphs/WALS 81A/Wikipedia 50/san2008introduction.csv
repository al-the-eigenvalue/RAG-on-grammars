"I assume that an NP in this situation bears a subject relation, unless context
clearly suggests otherwise. For example, if (89a) occurred as the answer to a question such as ‘Whose house are you going to?’ I would interpret no ‘1SG’ as a
possessor rather than a subject.

4.2.4.1Some marked word order/intonation patterns
IntroductionIn this section I exemplify some marked word order constructions in which the
ordering of subjects, objects, and obliques differs from the typical order shown in
Figure 4.2 (§4.2.2.3) in a systematically meaningful way. Marked constructions
typically involve movement of a phrase that is prominent in some way to the front
or back of the clause, where it may be prosodically marked as separate from the
remaining clausal constituents.
I define three features of these marked constructions: movement, copying, and
broken intonation. In some situations the features are codependent.22
Movement refers to the placing of an NP, PP or PlcP at either the left or right
edge of the clause, contrary to typical word order preference as described in Figure
4.2. Copying refers to the coreference of an initial or final constituent by a pronominal element within the clause. Broken intonation refers to distinct prosodic
treatment of the first referring expression of the unit, or of a post-verbal referring
expression. In the first case, the initial phrase is pronounced with rising intonation followed by a pause (‘comma intonation’), and there is thus an intonation unit
boundary between it and the clausal constituents that follow it. In the second case,
the right-moved phrase follows a predicate that is pronounced with closing intonation (distinguishing it from a clefted constituent).
I refer to left movement in Duna text that does not also involve copying or
broken intonation as fronting. Fronting is primarily associated with the pragmatic
property focus, and is only relevant to non-subject arguments, as subjects typically
precede other constituents in unmarked order.23
22For example, an object argument that is copied must also be moved (unless movement is a null
feature, for example, if the subject argument of the clause is elided rather than overt).
23
The fact that subject NPs generally occur clause initially suggests a default treatment of the
subject as a prominent participant.",[149]
"ObliqueI also identify an NP or a PP that occurs in an initial position in a nominal phrase
(§5.2.6) as having a possessor relation. The possessum is the referent of the notional
head of the NP in which the possessor phrase occurs. This is a phrase-internal4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses107rather than clause-level relation and I do not discuss it further in this chapter, except
with regard to ambiguity as to whether an NP has a subject or possessor relation

4.2.2.1Overview of typical word order
Subject and object NPsIn typical word order, subject argument NPs are clause-initial. Object NPs typically
follow subject NPs. R object NPs typically precede T object NPs. This ordering is
represented in Figure 4.1.

occur as part of a predicating constituent.19 This section examines complex predic19The exception to this is complex verbs that include a directional demonstrative. Directional
demonstratives have a wide range of functions and probably most typically occur as PlcP constituents244Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structuresations involving nouns, morphemes that are typically used in participant reference.
These include some more idiomatic predications that are not easily identified as
structurally distinct and productive operations. Rather, a combination of certain
words in certain expressions appears to ‘borrow’ an existing grammatical structure
in the language in an idiomatic way.
I begin by looking at two general classes of construction that I term ‘adjunct
noun constructions’ and ‘object-verb predications’.
A complex predication with an ‘adjunct noun’ (§7.5.2)20 is one in which an unmodified noun precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb, supplies semantic content
to the predication, and does not occupy an argument slot of the clause as required
by the verb. For example, if the verb is bivalent, the adjunct noun is additional to
(rather than replacing or making redundant) separate subject and object NPs that
may occur in the clause. The adjunct noun must follow other NPs, PPs and PlcPs in
the clause, although some other kinds of constituents (for example, temporals) may
be acceptably interposed between the adjunct noun and the verb.
An ‘object-verb predication’ (§7.5.3) is one in which a nominal phrase occupies
the P argument slot of a consonantal or wa-class bivalent verb. The apparent object
NP works in construction with the verb to provide the meaning of the predication,
and so cannot be elided in the usual way (§4.2.3.3). Object-verb predications are
idiomatic, in that the structure as a whole can be assigned a ‘literal’ meaning that
is distinct from its typical interpretation (Nunberg et al. 1994). Specific pairings
of nouns and verbs in Duna object-verb predications differ as to whether they are
fixed expressions that structurally resemble adjunct noun constructions in certain
ways (being more restricted in terms of word order flexibility and NP complexity/referentiality, and less semantically transparent) or more like independent object
NP and verb constituents in a typical bivalent clause.
Section 7.5.4 discusses a number of further expressions employing the verb ka‘be/stand’ that do not clearly match the structure of the other kinds of complex predicates discussed. As a simple predicate, this verb occurs with monovalent sense.
However, in combination with certain nouns, nominal phrases, or adjectives, it exhibits a constructional ambivalency; the introduction of a nominal or adjectival element can apparently license an additional argument in the clause. These expressions
are thus different from adjunct noun constructions, in which the argument structure
of the verb is unchanged; and from object-verb predications, in which the collocaor free adverbial elements.
20
I use the phrase ‘adjunct noun’ as an alternative to the phrase ‘adjunct (nominal)’ that is often
used in the Papuanist literature for nominal-like words that occur in constructions similar to those
described in this section. I use ‘noun’ rather than ‘nominal’ as in the Duna case the relevant words
are recognisable as ordinary common nouns.","[271, 272, 273]"

"5.4. Participant reference with multiple NPs165The double pronoun construction emphatically identifies the participants as a distinct group, and contrasted subject marking with -ka (§6.6.1) further highlights the
fact that it is this group only who engaged in this activity. The fact that the contrasted subject marker occurs on the second rather than the first pronoun (that is, the
opposite of what would be expected from typical word order if these pronouns were
separate subject and object NPs) supports a ‘single NP constituent’ interpretation.

In bivalent or trivalent clauses, the position of an oblique NP, PlcP or PP generally reflects the nature of its semantic role. Andrews (2007) distinguishes between
semantic roles that are ‘participatory’, being “borne by what one would think of as
actual participants in the situation implied by the verb” and ‘circumstantial’, being
“borne by entities that do not really participate, but instead form part of the setting
of the event” (2007:140). I follow this terminology in making a distinction between
participatory and circumstantial obliques, as this is indicative of word order preference. Participatory obliques typically follow an object NP (if present) whereas
circumstantial obliques typically precede an object NP. This is not a strictly maintained order, but is usual in the textual data.
Postpositional phrases marked with -ka ‘INSTR’ (§6.5.2) have the semantic role
of instrument, a typical participatory semantic role (Andrews 2007:140). Instrument
obliques typically follow an object NP, as in (65) and (66).",[136]

Unlike serialised verbs and predicates that include verb adjuncts, adjunct noun
constructions such as those shown in (547a) to (552) are not usually negated as a
unit, as shown by the unacceptability of (555a). Negation can be expressed through
applying the negative circumfix to the verb only, as shown in (555b). Example
(555b) shows that in an alternative interrogative (§11.1.3.4) the nominal may be
omitted at the second iteration of the predicate.

——————————————————————
Figure 7.5 Template of an ‘object-verb predication’Object-verb predications are predications that involve an NP and a verb. They
do not really represent a single formally distinct construction type, as the major
defining criterion is semantic and gradient rather than structural and categorically
discrete. Clauses that include object-verb predications show some characteristics
of ordinary bivalent clauses with subject and object NPs. They also share similarities with adjunct noun constructions in that word order is typically restricted, and
the meaning of the predication is substantially derived from a nominal constituent.
Object-verb predications are similar to ‘restricted collocations’ (Cowie 1998), combinations of words where the meaning of one element is “governed by its association
with another word or phrase” (Pawley 2007:7), for example, the expression ‘meet
demands’ in English. They are also idiomatic under Nunberg et al.’s (1994) definition in that the meaning cannot be predicted from the sum of its parts, and a literal248Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structuresTable 7.10 Some ‘object-verb predication’ expressionsNoun or semantic field

‘cord, fibre ’na‘eat’‘hang oneself’interpretation of the phrase is cases possible, albeit rather odd. Some examples of
object-verb predications are shown in Table 7.10.
It can be seen in Table 7.10 that some object-verb predications are part of a
family of expressions which follow a generalised semantic structure, rather than
being one-off expressions. For example, the existential verb (e)ra- ‘be/put’ occurs
in construction with nouns that denote bodily substances in clauses that describe
extrusion or excretion. The more members there are of the family, the more tenable
it becomes to say that what we are dealing with here is (constructional) polysemy
of the verb (see also §7.5.4.2).
Examples (556) - (560) illustrate some of the expressions shown in Table 7.10.
The apparent ‘object’ noun is unmodified and immediately precedes the verb.

1SG rope eat-INT‘I will hang myself.’ (lit. eat rope) (ED)
As with adjunct nominal constructions, placing the ‘object’ noun before the subject argument usually doesn’t work; see (561) and (562). This kind of inflexibility
argues against treating the expression as a typical bivalent clause (as subject and
object NPs can normally appear in either SO or OS order, the latter being pragmatically marked).

(Could mean: ‘A woman held a bird.’)
(562)* eya no nanda
cord 1SG eat-INT* I will hang myself (CD/XIV:156)
(Could mean: ‘I will eat cord’)
However, for at least some expressions, the nominal appears to be the head of a
full NP that references a P argument. In (563) the noun is modified by an adjective.
In (564) the noun is marked as specific (that is, is clearly referential) and does not
occur in the same clause as its host verb but in the preceding clause, that is, the
item is referenced through zero anaphora. In (564), there is no reason to analyse
mbalutana ‘the plane’ as anything other than an object NP, beyond the fact that it
collocates with a particular specialised meaning of the verb suwa- ‘hold’. This is
not in itself sufficient grounds to propose a distinct structural relationship.

(T/JP:KG05V7.11)
Individual object-verb predications show some differences concerning whether
or not the nominal element and the verb in the construction must be immediately
contiguous. For example, for the phrase khiau suwa- ‘use fire-making kit’, it is
possible for the time/manner word ala to occur in between the constituents (565),
and a locative NP can occur between hapa ‘egg’ and era- ‘put’ in the expression
‘lay eggs’ (566). See also the phrase mali suwa- ‘hold a mali dance’ in (549), in
which an (interrogative) temporal occurs in between the noun and the verb.

5.2.6Preposed possessor constituentsA noun NP can include a phrasal constituent that denotes a possessor-like entity
(XPposs ). This may be a nominal phrase or a postpositional phrase formed with
the NP postposition -ya ‘BEN’ (§6.5.4). The nature of the ‘possessive’ relationship
may differ somewhat according to the animacy and individuation of the possessor.
The positioning of a possessor NP before the possessed item is a typical word order
pattern in verb-final languages (Dryer 2007b).

"4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses121I refer to copying and/or broken intonation of a leftmost NP, PlcP or PP as left
dislocation.24 Left dislocation is primarily associated with the pragmatic property
‘link’ (Vallduvı́ 1992) and the ‘re-activation’ of topical participants in discourse
(Lambrecht 1994; Foley 2007).
I refer to any right edge placement of a constituent that coincides with broken
intonation as right dislocation.25 Right dislocation is associated with clarification
and ‘tidying’ a clause that the speaker judges as confused or ambiguous.
4.2.4.2FrontingAn object or oblique may be fronted and occur first in the clause.26 Fronting typically indicates that a referring expression is pragmatically prominent and focussed in
some way. For example, the phrase may constitute information that fills a perceived
gap in the hearer’s knowledge; the fronted phrase is in ‘new’ (or ‘completive’) focus (Dik 1989:392). This is seen in examples (90) - (93) which show first a situation described in unmarked word order, and then three question and answer pairs
in which a missing participant is placed at the beginning of the answer sentence.
These sentences show fronting of an object NP (91), a PP headed by the instrument
postposition -ka ‘INSTR’ (92), and an NP marked with -ra ‘CNCL’ (93). PK judged
that these sentences would only be acceptable utterances as answers to the relevant
question.27

Temporal expressions (§3.8) quite commonly follow a subject NP and precede
an object NP; see for example (319), (332). These describe the time setting of an
activity, that is, are typically circumstantial.
4.2.2.3SummaryThe typical ordering of subject and object NPs and obliques in the clause is summarised in Figure 4.2. Oblique constituents are identified as ‘participatory’ or ‘circumstantial’. If more than one object NP is present, R argument objects typically
precede T argument objects. The predicate is the only obligatory constituent.

4.2.3.1Reflexive clausesA clause with reflexive semantics describes a situation in which something acts
upon itself, fulfilling both the actor and undergoer participant roles required by a
bivalent predicate.13 As far as I am aware Duna does not have a distinct formal
construction that is specifically reserved for this kind of situation. In certain cases,
a clause can be identifed as reflexive, but this is a semantic rather than morphosyntactic label.
Examples (72) and (73) show clauses headed by the complex predicate waya
sa- ‘wash’. This predicate can head a clause with non-reflexive meaning (72), or
reflexive meaning (73).

"INTENS onecry-DEP
Predicate‘A very old woman was crying...’ (T/YS:KGV7.22)
A common noun such as ima in (109) is the notional head of the NP, in the sense
127128Chapter 5. Constituents of nominal phrasesthat it “refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:73).1
A nominal phrase that is notionally headed by a common noun (a ‘common noun
NP’) can consist of a common noun (N), one or more Adjectives (A), a quantifier
(Q) and a Demonstrative (Dem), which occur in fixed order, as shown in Figure
5.1. In nominal phrases that include a spatial demonstrative, an NP marker (§6.3)
is obligatory. Note that adjectives, quantifiers, and demonstratives can function
pronominally as well as adnominally, as the notional head does not need to be overt
in the phrase as a common noun if its identity is recoverable from context, for
example if it is referenced in the preceding clause or sentence or is a salient item in
the current speech setting.
———————————————————
(XPposs ) (N) (A)n (Q) (Dem)
———————————————————
Condition: One lexical constituent must occur
Figure 5.1 Ordering of words in a nominal phraseCommon noun NPs can also include a phrase-initial constituent that denotes a
possessor. This possessor can be expressed as an unmarked NP or a postpositional
phrase (formed with the NP postposition -ya ‘BEN’, §6.5.4). I notate this phrasal
constituent as ‘XPposs ’. Nominal phrases that exemplify the different possiblities of
the template shown in Figure 5.1 are presented and discussed in §5.2.
The clause shown in (110) contains two NPs, describing the two participants
required by the bivalent verbal predicate, sa- ‘strike’. The first NP consists of a
(CS-marked) proper name (PN), Polo-ka, the subject argument. This is a ‘Proper
name NP’ (NPP N ), further discussed in §5.3.2. The second nominal phrase consists
of a personal pronoun (PPro) no ‘1SG’. This is a ‘Personal pronoun NP’ (NPP P ro ),
discussed in §5.3.1.

Non-derived interrogative words can also occur in nominal phrases (§5.3.3).
Two or more NPs can be collocated to function as a single NP constituent, and this
and other complex ‘multiple NP’ constructions are described in §5.4.
1Cf. also Croft’s definition of the ‘primary information bearing unit’ (PIBU) of an NP as “the
most contentful item that most closely profiles the same kinds of thing that the whole constituent
profiles” (2001:259).","[156, 157]"

Purposive serialisation goes against the principle of time iconicity as observable in sequential and overlapping constructions, as the activity described by the
last verb in the series happens before the (intended) activity of the first verb. For
some verb combinations there is a ‘typical’ reading of either purposive or sequential/overlapping. For example, the serialisation of si ‘hold’ and a verb of motion
normally has an overlapping relationship, whereas serialisation of sei ‘take’ and a
verb of motion normally has a purposive relationship. This is exemplified in the
exchange shown in (501).
10A functionally similar purposive construction is achieved by using a verb marked with a suffix
-nda ‘PURP’, homophonous with the intentive final inflection (§8.2.2.3), as a medial form; see for
example (686) in §8.2.4.1. This kind of construction—that is, future-like marking on a non-final verb
to express the purpose of a following verb—also occurs in other (not closely related) languages of
the Highlands region, for example Ku Waru (Merlan and Rumsey 1991:330) and Kaluli (Schieffelin
1986:583-4). The Kaluli construction parallels the Duna construction very closely in that the inflection used in (same subject) medial purposives is homophonous with a final inflection that Scheiffelin
terms the ‘Intentive 1’. The Kaluli ‘Intentive 1’ final inflection is similar in meaning to the Duna
intentive final inflection. Thus in both cases we see a suffixal form that marks speaker intention (in
statements) on final clauses, and expresses a purposive relationship with respect to the following
verb on medial clauses.",[260]
"903.8.2
3.8.2.1Chapter 3. Word classesTime and manner adverbials
Time-of-day termsKnown time-of-day terms are shown in Table 3.15. Some of these words are transparently compositional, for example hewarako is composed of the forms hewa ‘sun’
and arako ‘middle’. I also include in this table some idiomatic clausal expressions
that refer to times of day.
Table 3.15 Time-of-day expressionsheka hakaya
sirakura
hewarako
yopo
ole riya
akura‘early morning’
‘morning’
‘middle of day’
‘afternoon’
‘evening’
‘night’(‘birds talk’)(‘crickets call’)Time-of-day expressions describe the time environment of a predicated activity
(see for example (388)). They can be followed by the postpositional intensifier
kone (which is generally quite unrestricted in terms of what it can modify), but are
not usually marked with other bound forms, and do not occur as constituents in
independent structural units (for example, nominal phrases). In this typical use I
refer to them as adverbs. However, there are also some examples in my data in
which time-of-day terms are inflected with (non-final) verbal morphology, in which
case I understand them to be functioning as a kind of verbal predicate. Time of
day-terms are also used as greetings, in which case a drawn out vowel o is typically
added to the end of the expression.
3.8.2.2Time/manner wordsKnown time/manner terms are shown in Table 3.16. These are formally disparate,
although each term has something in common with at least one other term in the
table.

awe

ikane
hapia‘first, earlier, immediately’
‘soon’
‘after’
‘immediately, hastily’
‘later’
‘in a bit (sooner than itane)’
‘before, immediately, hastily’3.9. Interrogatives91Some time/manner terms have only a ‘time-ordering’ sense, that is they designate the time of a predicated activity in relation to other times and events. This is
true of itane, ikane, ala, and ari. The first three terms are free adverbials, that is,
expressions that are not limited to a particular position in the clause. Ari is unique
in the set in that it occurs post-verbally. This morpheme is very rare in my data.
The time/manner terms ha and hapia have both a time-ordering sense (‘immediately’) and a manner sense (‘hastily, quickly’). The form ha always occurs immediately preceding the predicate (see, for example, (633)). The terms hapia ‘before’
and awe ‘later’ do not have a fixed position as adverbial elements, but typically occur either sentence-initially (148) or following a subject NP (253). They can also
occur in a quasi-nominal capacity in NPs; see for example (182).
3.8.2.3Manner adverbsThe Duna data includes a small number of words that function only as free adverbials,28 describing the manner in which the predicated activity is done (see for
example (238)). Some examples of these manner adverbs are shown in Table 3.17.

‘allowingly’
‘firmly’
‘quietly, slowly, gently’
‘without cause, without consequence, aimlessly’InterrogativesInterrogatives are words that occur in questions to “indicate either all by themselves,
or with the help of syntactic features of the question in which they occur, which
part of the proposition the the asker is interested in knowing about” (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985:185), and thus typically (although not necessarily) delineate a gap in
speaker knowledge. Duna sentences that include an interrogative word are defined
as interrogative sentences (§11.1.3.5).
Duna interrogatives split into two groups, non-derived and derived. Non-derived
interrogatives cannot be productively composed from extant morphemes (although
in most cases the forms suggest that they were originally compositional). Derived
interrogatives are formed from the interrogative root pa- ‘query’ in combination
with a bound morpheme, for example an NP marker.
28An exception to this is sakore ‘quietly, slowly, gently’, which in one instance in the textual data
occurs with the iterative medial verb inflection, -rua (ITER).","[118, 119, 120]"
"INTENS one take. PFV‘One time before I got a very serious illness.’ (T/HS:180605i)
As for nominal elements in object-verb predications, there is some evidence that
in some expressions the ailment noun (or NP) occupies the P participant slot that is
subcategorised for by the bivalent verb that it occurs with, and is an object NP.
Firstly, it can be seen that although one can view the ailment as affecting the
experiencer, it is not the subject of the bivalent verb in the construction. Examples
(614) and (615) show different uses of the noun malaria. In (614), malaria heads a
subject NP in an ordinary bivalent clause headed by the verb kole- ‘break, split’. The
NP is marked as a contrasted subject with the morpheme -ka. Example (615a) shows
the noun malaria occurring with the verb sa- ‘take, get’ as part of an ailment+verb
predication. It is not the subject of the clause and cannot be CS-marked, as shown
in (615b).

1SG malaria take-DEP‘I have malaria’
b. * no malaria-ka sa-ya
1SG malaria-CS take-DEP* I have malaria (CD)
Examples (616) and (617) illustrate that a clause headed by the phrase papu
na- has structural features of an ordinary bivalent clause, with the experiencer being realised as a subject NP, and the ailment being realised as an object NP. It is262Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structurespossible for the NP that references the experiencer of the ailment to be CS-marked,
identifying it as the subject of the clause (616) . Example (617) shows that for this
phrase flexibility of word order is allowable, as in typical bivalent clauses.

(617)papukone, Keni-ka neya-na.anguish INTENS PSN-CS eat.IPFV-SPEC‘True anguish, Kenny is suffering [it].’ (ED/XV:60)
Ailment + verb constructions usually undergo verb-only rather than unitary negation with the negative circumfix, as shown in (618). This is characteristic of other
noun + verb constructions.

7.6.2Other involuntary experience predicates7.6.2.1Involuntary perception expressionsI have recorded four forms that are typically used in combination with the verb ke‘see’ to describe certain involuntary experiences. I refer to predicates that include
these forms, shown in Table 7.13, as involuntary perception expressions.

predications, but some features suggest that the non-verb element in the phrase is
comparable to either a noun or verb adjunct. For example, the form hinde can occur7.6. Complex predicates that describe involuntary experience263in an NP as in (619), and in combination with the verb ke- ‘see’ in an apparent
complex predication as in (620). The form uati ‘sleepy’25 typically occurs with

In example sentences I use a hyphen (-) to represent ligature between two morphemes where
(at least one) of the morphemes does not occur as a freestanding form. I use the equals sign
(=) to represent ligature for: bound morphemes that attach to the final predicate, but do not
occur in a primary inflectional capacity (§8.1.1.1), that is, epistemic particles (§10.4) and
the sentence-final markers =nia ASSERT and =pe ‘Q’ (§11.1); and dependent third person
pronouns (§6.6.3). I do not use ‘-’ versus ‘=’ to represent an overall distinction between
affixes and a clitics. A large number of the bound forms that I describe in this thesis are
arguably clitics on the basis of their distributional flexibility. However, a more developed
understanding of Duna phonology is necessary to explore the validity and applicability of
a clear clitic/affix distinction, and I use ‘=’ for morphemes which are anomalous in other
ways.
Where a single Duna morpheme requires glossing with more than one English word,
these are separated by a full stop. In certain cases where a given morpheme encodes more
than one category or meaning I use a forward slash (/) to separate these two meanings.
Words in example sentences that are clearly related to Tok Pisin and/or English words
are annotated ‘lw’ (for ‘loan word’) in the gloss. Some of the examples in this thesis include Duna words that belong to a “special esoteric vocabulary” (Haley 2002:132) called
kẽyaka. Kẽyaka terms are used extensively in song, but are not typically used in everyday
conversation or spoken narratives. Kẽyaka terms are indicated in example sentence glosses
with ‘k.’ preceding the approximate import of the word.
In Chapters 9 to 11 approximations of perception events that are entailed by evidential
markers (§9.2) are shown in curly brackets in the English translation.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"

As a general rule, altering word order so that the ailment noun precedes the

24The ailment nouns siki ‘sickness’ and malaria ‘malaria, (fever, sickness)’ are clearly derived
from English/Tok Pisin. I assume that the constructions using the two new terms are based upon
an original construction, naki sa-. Haley (2002:111) reports that khenekene was originally used to
refer to influenza (§1.1.3); it appears to be derived from a reduplication of the nominal/verbal root

"346Chapter 9. Evidential and information status markerspendent but is part of a larger complex sentence structure; for example if the marked
clause bears a specific function in a matrix clause (cf. Bickel 1999:3), or is overtly
marked as a clause of purpose or reason (etc.). This is not entirely satisfactory, but
is adequate for my basic descriptive purposes.
It is of interest to note that the Duna use of the specificity marker on final
verbs in independent clauses shows some structural and functional similarity to
non-embedded nominalisations in several Tibeto-Burman language subgroups (for
example, Kiranti and Bodic), in which a morpheme that is used in nominalisation operations (and in some cases also functions as a singular definite article in
noun phrases) marks main clauses in attention-drawing, emphatic and/or ‘constative’ (“it’s a fact”) utterances.45 More generally, these ‘nominalisations’ are probably
examples of insubordination, the independent use of an apparently (or erstwhile)
subordinate structure (Evans 2007). Two functions of insubordination identified by
Evans that are of particular relevance to the Duna and Bodic examples are the expression of epistemic and evidential meanings, and the signalling of presupposed
material.
9.3.2.3Overview of the expression of present time eventsWe have now looked at the full range of known Duna morphemes that can occur as
primary inflections on final verbs in the expression of (non-habitual) present time
events, first introduced in Table 8.3 and reproduced here as Table 9.6.46 The group
includes three TAM forms (one of which is applicable to wa-class and consonantal
verbs only), four visual and non-visual sensory evidential markers, the individual
standpoint information status marker -pa, and specificity marker -na (the last two
being applicable only to regular verbs). The morphemes are formally and semantically disparate, but also functionally contrastive, and can be though of as providing
a speaker with a finite set of choices in regard to the (maximally simple) expression
of a situation that holds at the time of utterance.
45For example, in detailing the functions of nominalising morphology in Bodic languages (a postulated genetic grouping within Tibeto-Burman), Noonan (2008) notes that: “when nominalizations
[i.e., constructions headed by nominalisations or forms morpholgically identical to them] appear as
main clauses, the typical effect is one of mirativity, i.e. the sense that the predication so expressed
is in some sense surprising, contrary to expectation, or in some way exasperating”. In discussing
Kiranti languages (Tibeto-Burman), Bickel (1999) argues that the use of nominalisation markers on
non-embedded clauses represents a focus construction. Such constructions may be used in Belhare,
for example: “to instantiate a controversial discourse variable” (for example, in an utterance that
emphatically rejects a suggestion or insinuation made by an interlocutor); in the instantiation of an
open variable (completive focus) where “a speaker claims her proposition to be the definite answer
to the question”; or to re-instantiate a variable in narrative in order to “ascertain that the audience is
fully aware of the proposition and does not doubt it any further” (Bickel 1999).
46
The special present form of nga- ‘go’ (ngui) is not included in the array, as it is only applicable
to one verb. However, in relation to later discussion in this section, the fact that this inflection only
occurs in sentences with volitional informant subjects means there is a good argument to be made
that it encodes participatory semantics.","[374, 375]"

In (462a), -ria- AGAIN, -ku- EXHAUST and the causative morpheme -wae (§7.2.4)
occur in combination with each other on a single verb. The ordering of the two modifiers -ria- and -ku- is not fixed, and changing the order does not alter the meaning
of the sentence, as shown in (462b).

The morpheme -ria is transparently related to the verb riya- ‘return’, but I treat
it as a distinct morpheme (that is, rather than Vlast in aspect-modifying serialisation, see §7.3.3.4) as it shows some structural differences to a verb in series and is7.2. Complex verbs223typically phonologically distinct from the free verb. Examples (463a) and (463b)
demonstrate that -ria- has a different status to the aspectual verb yoko- ‘stretch’
(§7.3.3.4). In (463a), -ria- attaches to the serialised verb root yoko-. Reversing
the order of these forms as in (463b) is not acceptable, showing that they are not
structurally equivalent (cf. the free ordering of -ria and -ku as shown in (462)).

b. *ngei-ria yoko-pa.

The bound morpheme -ku- indicates that the activity of the
predicate is carried out toward the speaker (or another entity, generally human or
high animacy, that is identified as a deictic centre).4 Two examples are shown in
(464) and (465).","[251, 252]"
"4.2. Participant reference in verbal clauses125Example (104) shows an NP that is left dislocated when its referent is already
known but has not been mentioned for several clauses. The mother (antia) has not
been referenced (either overtly or through zero anaphora) for nine clauses.

Example (105) is taken from a story that appears to be based on Jack and the
Beanstalk. The bean seed (mbatano eke) has been introduced into the narrative
previously and referred to several times when the main character (a boy) sees and
buys the bean at a market. It has not been referenced for six clauses which detail
the boy’s return home and his attempt to conceal his activities from his watchful
mother.

The linking and reactivating functions of left dislocation are not distinct, as reactivation builds on the fact that a participant is already known, that is, is a potential
link.
4.2.4.4Right dislocationIn what I term right dislocation in Duna a participant is referenced or reiterated
following the predicate. The final verb of the clause has closing intonation, and the
final NP is tacked on as an afterthought. Right dislocation is used in clarification,
for example to repair a sentence that contains hesitations, truncations, repetitions
and/or referential ambiguity (106 and 107), or to expand on something the speaker
feels they have described erroneously or imprecisely (108).

5.1IntroductionThis chapter outlines the structure of nominal phrases (NPs) and describes in more
detail the words that can occur as part of them, including common nouns, adjectives,
quantifiers, demonstratives, proper names, personal pronouns, and interrogatives.
The chapter examines properties that are relevant at the word level (for example,
the morphological structure of nouns), and those that apply at the phrase level (for
example, what words do and do not typically co-occur within an NP), as well as outlining some features of NPs that have to do with the clause as a whole (for example,
reference properties of personal pronouns with regard to grammatical relation). It is
mainly concerned with free and phrasal rather than bound constituents of referring
expressions, the latter being described in the following chapter.
Nominal phrases are (potentially) referring expressions that describe entities,
typically those that are participants required by the predicate that heads the clause
in which they occur. A nominal phrase functions as one constituent within the larger
structure of the clause. It may consist of a single word, or a sequence of words that
follow a fixed templatic order. Morphological operations that relate to features such
as specificity or semantic role are applied once to this constituent as a whole.
The clause shown in (109) contains one nominal phrase, describing the single
participant (the subject) required by the monovalent verbal predicate he- ‘cry’. This
NP includes a common noun ima ‘woman’, an intensified adjective khera kone ‘very
old’ that describes a further property of the woman, and the quantifier ndu which
indicates both singularity and indefiniteness.

4.2.4.3Left dislocationSubjects, objects, possessors, and obliques may be left dislocated.29 In such constructions, it is typical for the left dislocated element to be something the speaker
assumes the hearer already knows about (but cannot otherwise identify), while the
remainder of the clause provides new information. A left dislocated constituent in
Duna thus corresponds to Foley’s (2007:404) definition of a topic, “the link which
ties the information communicated in this sentence with what has preceded”.30
In (101) and (102),31 the left dislocated ‘links’ (shown in bold type) correspond
to things that have recently been introduced into the text. Morphological marking on
the left dislocated NP reflects the participant’s clause-internal semantic role and/or
29In examples in the textual data, obliques are fronted with broken intonation, but are not copied.
I have not tested whether copying is possible for all kinds of oblique constituents.

6.1IntroductionThis chapter describes bound forms that occur at the right edge of a referring expression; constituents of a phrase that are dependent markers rather than free lexemes.1
The bound forms presented in §6.2 - §6.5 are grouped according to a combination of semantic, distributional, and functional properties into four types: epistemic
demonstratives, NP markers, PlcP markers, and postpositions. The general order
of application of these markers is shown in Figure 6.1, with ‘L’ standing for ‘last
potentially free-standing lexeme of the phrase’ (a nominal, adjective, quantifier,
demonstrative, or interrogative root).2

——————————————————————————Figure 6.1 Order of co-occurring phrase-final morphemesEpistemic markers can be included in a phrase to indicate features concerning speaker and hearer knowledge of the referent (§6.2). These markers occupy a
roughly equivalent position in the referring expression to a demonstrative (§5.2.4),
and can (and in some cases must) be followed by an NP or PlcP marker. These
forms also occur mark epistemic assessment on final predicates, where they take
scope over a proposition rather than an entity.
1Note that, although all of the bound morphemes described in this chapter are postpositional in
that they are placed after the lexical constituents of a phrase, I reserve the label ‘postposition’ (P) for
the forms described in §6.5 only.
2
This representation does not provide a minimal or exhaustive template, and does not address
the complex co-occurrence restrictions and dependency relationships that exist between individual
forms. Rather, it is intended to indicate that if more than one type of marker is present in a single
referring expression, this is the way they will be arranged.","[194, 195]"
"1024.1.2.4Chapter 4. Basic clause structureNon-verbal roots as monovalent predicatesAdjectival roots can be marked with inflectional morphology and occur as heads
of monovalent clauses. Examples (50) and (51) show adjectival roots occurring as
monovalent predicates.
(50) Kui anoa nguni kone, Yuna anoa-ka paya-na.
GPN manbadINTENS GPNman-CS good-HAB‘Huli men are very bad, Duna men behave well.’ (CED/XV:7)
(51) no rakare-yarua.
1SG cold-SNS . C‘I am cold.’ (CD/III:71)
Note that in (50), the single argument of this monovalent clause, Yuna anoa
‘Duna men’, is marked with the contrasted subject marker -ka (§6.6.1). KK judged
that his would be unacceptable in a clause headed by a non-verbal adjectival predicate (i.e., one that is not marked with inflectional morphology, see §4.1.1), as shown
in (52).
(52) * anoa ha-na-kapaya koneman there-SPEC-CS good INTENSThat man is very good (CD/XV:6)
4.1.3Bivalent clausesBivalent clauses are headed by a predicate that semantically requires two participants. For example the bivalent verb sa- ‘strike, hit, kill’ subcategorises for a
striker and a thing that is struck. The verb encodes an activity that includes an
agent, “a participant which the meaning of the verb describes as doing something,
or causing something to happen” and a patient, “a participant which the verb describes as having something happen to it, and as being affected by what happens to
it” (Andrews 2007:137). I refer to items that fill the participant slots of a bivalent
clause as ‘A’ and ‘P’ arguments. Typically an A argument has agent-like semantics
and a P argument has patient-like semantics, but this is not always the case. For
example, the verb may specify other kinds of semantic roles such as the theme and
path required by the verb mbite-, ‘cross (a waterway)’; or a bivalent verb may be
used in expressing an involuntary experience in which the A argument is an experiencer and the P argument a stimulus (§7.6).
An A argument can be realised in the clause as an NP, or through zero anaphora (§4.2.3.3). An A argument NP is typically either obligatorily marked as a
‘contrasted subject’, or eligible for contrasted subject marking if certain pragmatic
conditions exist (§6.6.1). The identity of an A argument restricts or predicts the4.1. Clause types103range of bound morphemes that can be applied to the predicate (§11.2). Unlike P
arguments, third person A arguments may typically be referenced by an NP that includes a free or dependent personal pronoun without any implication of pragmatic
prominence (see sections 5.3.1.1 and 6.6.3).
A P argument can be realised as an unmarked NP (that is, one that is not overtly
marked for semantic role, grammatical relation, or prominence, see Chapter 6),
an NP marked with -ta ‘LOC’ (§6.3.4.2), or have zero anaphoric reference. A P
argument NP is never marked as a contrasted subject, and its identity does not have
direct bearing on predicate morphology.
Three examples of bivalent verbal clauses are shown in (53) - (55). In each
case the P argument is realised as an unmarked NP. The A arguments are realised
as either an unmarked NP (example (53)) or an NP that is marked as a contrasted
subject (examples (54) and (55)). In each example the A argument NP precedes the
P argument NP, and this exemplifies typical word order (§4.2.2).

The serialised verbs shown in (482) describe two activities that are performed
in sequence. These sentences are examples of time iconic SVCs as the activity that
happens first is presented first in the series. Other examples of this type, including
serialised verbs that describe overlapping as well as sequential activities, are shown
in §7.3.3.1. The subsequent sections also exemplify serialised verbs that: describe
events that have a purposive relationship (i.e., Vlast occurs in order that Vn may
take place) (§7.3.3.2); denote integrated activities or a single activity (§7.3.3.3); and
contribute aspectual or directional meaning to the predicate (§7.3.3.4).
7.3.2
7.3.2.1Some general features of verb serialisation
Number of verbs in seriesDuna verb serialisations typically include only two verb roots, and I have not found
more than three verbs occurring in series in the textual data. Two examples of threeverb serialisations are shown in (483) and in the first clause of (484). These both
show a sequential followed by an overlapping temporal relationship: the subject
does something to an object and then relocates it. This is a typical pattern for threeverb sequences in Duna.

7.3.2.2ContiguitySerialised verbs as noted in the textual data are always contiguous. Interposing
an NP between the verbs was judged to be unacceptable, as shown in (485). This
contrasts with verbs that head medial clauses.","[256, 257]"
"Chapter 7Some complex predicate structures
7.1IntroductionPredicates of verbal clauses in Duna often consist of a verb only, in the sense that
a single inflected verb root occurs clause-finally, and denotes ‘what’s going on’,
determining the argument structure of the clause and the semantic roles of the participants. Predicates of verbal clauses may also be complex, being “composed of
more than one grammatical morpheme (either morphemes or words) each of which
contributes part of the information ordinarily associated with a head” (Alsina et al.
1997).
This chapter identifies five major complex predication structures in Duna, summarised in Table 7.1.
Table 7.1 Complex predicate typesLabel
Complex verb:Composition
Verb-Modifier(s)-See:
§7.2Verb serialisation:(Verb-) Verb- Verb§7.3Verb adjunct (Va):Va Verb§7.4Adjunct nominal:N Verb§7.5.2Object-verb predication:NPobject Verb§7.5.3An individual complex predicate expression will map broadly to the one of
structures laid out in Table 7.1. However, many also show particular non-predictable
characteristics, relating for example to morphological composition, argument structure, or degree of lexicalisation. Some complex predications (particularly examples
of those structures that include a nominal) are idiomatic, comprising a conventialised expression the meaning of which cannot be predicted from knowledge of the
2187.1. Introduction219constiutents as they occur in isolation from each other (Nunberg et al. 1994:492).
In the first four sections of this chapter I proceed from complex predicates in
which the morphemic components are highly bound (for example, as a unitary stem
that cannot be separated) to those more idiomatic constructions in which the components are free lexemes or phrases that are semantically rather than formally interdependent.
Section 7.2 describes the derivation of complex verbs through the addition of
a directional demonstrative root, bound aspectual/adverbial form, or participantadding morpheme. Sections 7.3 - 7.5 define three major types of complex predicate
construction with reference to the word class of the constituent that occurs in addition to a clause-final verb.
In §7.3, I examine predicates that are composed of two or three verbs in series,
with an uninflected verb (or verbs) preceding an inflected verb. Typically verbs in
series must be contiguous, and the preferred method of negation with the negative
circumfix (§8.3) is ‘unitary’, that is, with the circumfix surrounding the whole series
as a single stem. Some verbs in series describe distinct activities; some are lexicalised to refer to a single activity that is not necessarily predictable from the meaning of the individual verb roots; and some occur in ‘asymmetrical’ constructions
(Aikhenvald 2006) in which the last verb in the series aspectually or directionally
modifies the preceding verb.
Section 7.4 concerns predicates that are composed of a verb in combination
with a ‘verb adjunct’ (§3.4). Both constituents can contribute to the meaning and
argument structure of the predicate. A verb adjunct typically immediately precedes
its host verb, and interposed constituents are generally dispreferred. The negative
circumfix can be applied either to the verb only, or to the verb adjunct + verb combination as a whole.
Complex predicates where a verb combines with a noun or NP are examined in
§7.5. The negative circumfix is not applied to the expression as a whole, but occurs
on the verb root only. The nominal element may be introduced into a clause in which
there is no argument slot for it to occupy (occurring as an ‘adjunct noun’), or occur
with a multivalent verb for which it can be posited as an object NP in what I term
an ‘object-verb predication’. Typically the nominal element is a non-referential and
unmodified common noun, and subject to an ordering restriction that it must follow
other NPs, PPs, or PlcPs in the clause, but some variation in regard to these features
is allowable.
Section 7.5 describes some further families of minor constructions that consist
of an NP or adjective in combination with the existential verb ka- ‘be/stand’. It also
discusses some special predicating structures that include existential verbs and are220Chapter 7. Some complex predicate structuresconcerned with the expression of possession and proper inclusion.
Section 7.6 looks at complex predicates that describe involuntary experience.
These represent a variety of construction types that are related but not identical
to some of those described in §7.3 - §7.5, and are grouped together on a largely
semantic basis.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"106Chapter 4. Basic clause structurethat is employed in its accomplishment. A nominal, place, or postpositional phrase
stands in a particular relation to the structure of the clause in which it occurs. In this
section I identity three such relations: subject, object, and oblique.
The criteria I use for identifying these relations are varied: a subject is defined
on the basis of argument type (that is, represents a grouping of S and A arguments);
an object as a particular NP realisation of certain arguments; and an oblique through
reference to morphological marking and/or non-argument status.
SubjectS and A arguments have a subject relation. In contrast to other arguments:• A subject argument can in pragmatically and/or semantically appropriate circumstances be realised as a CS-marked NP (§6.6.1).
• The realisation of a third person subject argument as a free pronoun or an NP that
includes a dependent pronoun does not imply pragmatic prominence (see sections
5.3.1.1 and 6.6.3).
• The identity of the subject argument restricts and/or predicts morphological marking
of the predicate (§11.2). These restrictions and predictions are generally only relevant
to animate and volitional subjects, and can be manipulated to semantic and pragmatic
effect.","[134, 135]"
"7.6. Complex predicates that describe involuntary experience265Emotion words can also combine with a verb as part of a complex predicate.
In these instances the emotion words are noun-like, and parallels to several of the
complex predicate structures described in the preceding sections are observable.
Example (630) shows khenowa ‘sad’ occurring with the verb wa- ‘do, have’.
The pronoun that references the sorrower is in the contrastive subject form (§6.6.1),
showing that that an experiencer can be overtly identified as the subject argument
of the clause.27 As wa- is a bivalent verb, this is structurally analogous to an objectverb predication. The emotion word supplies the main semantics of the clause,
supported by a bivalent verb that takes it as a P argument.

Examples (631) -(633) show khenowa ‘sadness’, suru ‘happiness’ and lembo
‘anger’ occurring in combination with the verb ka- ‘be’. The verb supplies inceptive
meaning in clauses that describe a change in emotional state. In (631) and (632), the
emotion word is modified by the adjective phuka ‘big’. These examples are similar
to object-verb type predications with ka- (§7.5.4.2).

"1.4Thesis overviewThis thesis describes certain structures of Duna grammar that are used in building
simple sentences, and looks in detail at some semantic themes that are encoded in
the bound morphemes of the language, particularly those that are to do with expressing attitudes to knowledge. It is an introduction to the language, and does not
present a comprehensive inventory of Duna grammatical morphemes and operations, or deal with complex sentence structures (for example, those involving clause
embedding or coordination).
Chapter 2 provides an overview of Duna phonology, including a description of
the phonemic inventory and the major allophones of these phonemes, and a preliminary statement concerning lexical tone in monomorphemic words. In Chapter 3, I
define Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, and list the known members
of small closed classes. Chapter 4 presents an overview of major clause types and
features of basic clause structure.
In Chapters 5 and 6, I examine the structure of nouns, nominal phrases (NPs),
place phrases (PlcPs), and postpositional phrases (PP), constituents that typically
occur to represent participants in the clause. This includes an account of morpholo-1.4. Thesis overview27gically complex nouns and the lexical structure of NPs (Ch. 5), and itemisation and
illustration of bound morphemes that indicate the epistemic positioning, number,
definiteness, grammatical function, semantic role, and/or prominence of the phrase
to which they are added (Ch. 6).
In Chapters 7 to 11, I look in more detail at predicating constituents. Chapter
7 provides examples and discussion of certain complex predicate constructions, including complex verbs, serialised verbs, and predicates that are composed of a verb
in combination with a free lexeme such as a noun or adjective.
Chapter 8 begins my exploration of bound forms that occur on ‘final’ predicates.
Final predicates head an independent clause that constitutes a complete sentence
in itself, or occurs last in a chain of dependent clauses. Chapter 8 is concerned
with inflectional forms that occur on verbs, and indicate time, event modality, and
polarity features of the predicated activity, for example whether it is complete or
ongoing, or whether the speaker desires it to occur.
In Chapter 9 I describe two groups of bound forms (evidential and information
status markers) that a speaker can use as final verb inflections to supply an epistemic
assessment of the proposition that is encoded in the utterance, as well as to supply
temporal information. Evidential markers typically indicate a source of information
(for example, whether the predicated activity was seen to occur), and information
status markers encode other kinds of attitudes towards the proposition (for example
as knowledge that is new or familiar).
In Chapter 10, I illustrate complex final morphology constructions in which
evidential and information status markers are added following inflected verb forms
rather than bare roots, discuss the use of these forms in non-verbal clauses, and
introduce some further bound forms and constructions that are concerned in the
expression of epistemic assessment.
Chapter 11 examines final predicate markers as described in Chapters 8 to 10
with respect to the sentence types of Duna, focussing on the way that certain forms
make different predictions about the relationship of the speaker to the proposition
in interrogative as opposed to non-interrogative sentences. In this last chapter I also
provide an overview of epistemic assessment and the final predicate in Duna.","[55, 56]"
"88Chapter 3. Word classesI have found it difficult to identify systematic contrast between wa, eto, epa and
apo in a way that is consistent with all examples of these forms in the data, and the
gloss terms I use are either an approximation of their typical usage, or a semantically
empty formal label. Wa is typically associated with locations a short distance (for
example, a few metres or less) away from the speaker. Eto most commonly refers to
mid-distance locations to the fore of the speaker, and/or in a cross-valley direction.
For example, from my fieldhouse in Rewapi, the airstrip (at a lower altitude than
Rewapi, some 3km in a north-east direction), and other locations along this path,
were eto. Other things that were right in front of the speaker, at a distance of more
than a few metres, could also be eto. Epa seems to be used primarily in designating
locations and directions to the side of the speaker. For example, someone who is
looking to the side in order to avoid meet the gaze of someone who is standing in
front of them is looking epa. Apo is associated with greater distances than the other
terms, and movement on a level plane away from a deictic centre.","[116, 117]"
"1SG 2SG.CS suppress-SEQ leave-PROHIB‘Do not suppress and then abandon me.’ (T/SN:101203i)
The prohibitive suffix attaches to the o-base of consonantal verbs as shown
in (697) and (698).27 The semi-consonantal ra- ‘sit’ also uses the o-base for this
inflection, as shown in (699).
25Comrie (2003) discusses the fact that full or partial suppletion of a verb ‘give’ with respect to
the person of the recipient is quite a widespread phenomenon in the world’s languages, even in those
languages that (like Duna) do not generally show any object or indirect object agreement on verb.
26
König and Siemund (2007:308-311) note that the presence of a prohibitive marker, that is, a
morpheme that is specific to negative directives and occurs on sentences that are not otherwise
marked as negative, is a comparatively infrequent phenomena cross-linguistically. Out of their
sample of 70 languages only four had special prohibitive morphology of this kind.
27
There is probably a phonological basis for this: Several inflections outlined in this section are
marked on regular verbs by suffixes that are not consonant-intial but start with a labialised and/or
rounded glide or vowel, probably derived from the initial bilabial of the verb wa- ‘do’. These suffixes
attach to the o-base of consonantal verbs, or alternatively appear in the surface form to be directly
affixed to the base consonant. The exception to this is the suffix wayeni, see §8.2.4.4, for which the
base form varies.",[322]
"2SG.CS what kill.PFV‘What did you kill?’24The definition of left dislocation is confined by some scholars (see e.g., Foley 2007:443) to
describing constructions that involve copying. Left movement (and typically also broken intonation)
that does not involve copying may be referred to as ‘topicalisation’. However I do not use the latter
term for this as I use the word ‘topical’ elsewhere in a somewhat different sense, and because it seems
appropriate to use a single term for both construction types in Duna as they function similarly.
25
Thus, my use of this term is broad, and does not refer specifically to situations in which the
constituent in question is is represented by a pronominal element (or zero anaphora) in the clause,
and by an NP in the right dislocated phrase.
26
This is of course only observable if a constituent that would be predicted to occur before the
fronted constituent is present in the clause. For example, an object that is the only NP in a clause
will be clause-initial but is not ‘fronted’.
27
In this ‘answer to a question’ situation, there is a preference for fronted participants to be overtly
marked as indefinite with the quantifier ndu (see also §5.2.3.3). For example, when I first suggested
the constituent arrangement shown in (92), I did not have ndu within the instrument-referent NP, and
this was corrected by PK who thought that the sentence sounded much better with ndu included.",[150]
"Abstract
This thesis is an introduction to Duna, a language spoken by approximately 25,000
people living in Southern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea. Duna (also
known as Yuna) is classified as a member of the Duna-Bogaya subgroup of the Trans
New Guinea family. This study is primarily based on work with Duna speakers of
the Lake Kopiago region.
The thesis provides a basic treatment of phonology, describes the structure of
simple sentences, and examines in detail the expression of epistemic assessment
(the treatment of a proposition as representing knowledge), a semantic domain that
is richly encoded by bound morphemes in the language.
Chapter 1 gives background information concerning the Duna lands, people,
and language situation. It also describes previous work that has been done on the
language, and the nature and sources of the data used in this study.
Chapter 2 includes an overview of Duna segmental phonology and gives an
account of citation tone contrasts in monomorphemic words.
Chapter 3 outlines Duna word classes, including large open lexical classes such
as nouns, and smaller closed grammatical classes such as demonstratives.
Chapter 4 deals with the structure of the basic clause, describing the different
clause types and outlining dominant and pragmatically marked word orders.
Nouns and NP structure are treated in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 details NP marking
that encodes epistemic positioning, specificity, pairhood, grouphood, semantic role,
grammatical relation, and discourse or pragmatic prominence.
Chapter 7 analyses complex predicates, for example, those that are composed
of a verb and a verb adjunct, or of several verbs in series.
The remainder of the thesis focusses on bound morphemes that are added to
the predicate of a final clause. Chapter 8 treats markers which specify features
of the denoted situation in terms of time or event modality. Chapters 9 and 10
describe evidential markers, information status markers, and epistemic particles,
morphemes which attach to a final predicate to express an epistemic assessment of
the proposition.
Chapter 11 describes the formal and functional features of Duna sentence types
and discusses typical implications that certain predicate markers have concerning a
speaker’s or addressee’s relationship to the denoted situation.iAcknowledgements
Many Duna people in the Lake Kopiago area and in Mount Hagen (Western Highlands Province) have contributed language material and discussion to this work. I
thank them wholeheartedly for their essential part in this study, as well as their excellent company. Kenny Kendoli, Petros Kilapa, Kipu Piero and Richard Alo in
particular translated and discussed their language with humour, patience, tenacity,
thoughtfulness, and insight. Richard, you were taken from us too soon, and I continue to honour your great courage, intelligence, and compassion.
Whilst at Lake Kopiago I was very lucky to be able to record texts from the late
Sane Noma and Raki Patako, and from Pastor Hagini Yami, three senior Duna men
of extraordinary wisdom and spirit. Special thanks also to Kipu, Metai Heri, Haya
Suku, Monica Kenny and Metina Kali for the hard work they put into conversing
with a learner of their language.
In the field I was based at an ANU research house in Rewapi (Hirane parish),
next door to Kenny and Kipu and their family members. Many thanks to them
for putting up with the extra disruption and responsibilities that this entailed, and
to other members of the Rewapi/Hirane and wider Lake Kopiago community who
were so welcoming and kind. I hope to find some way to repay you.
In writing this thesis I have been privileged to be under the tutelage of my supervisors Andrew Pawley and Alan Rumsey of the Research School of Pacific and
Asian Studies. Andy whipped the bulk of my early chapter drafts into shape, and devoted much time and effort to his careful reading of a near-final draft of the thesis.
His stringent and perspicuous advice has been of immense value to me at every
stage of the writing process. Alan Rumsey has conscientiously read even my most
off-the-rail writings, and consistently offered wise and sensitive feedback. He has
helped me to battle with some difficult organisational problems, and been encouraging and engaged throughout.
My advisor Malcolm Ross contributed significantly to a reworking of Chapters
1-7 with his thoughtful, precise, and clear-sighted comments. Nicholas Evans got
stuck into Chapters 8-11 with enthusiasm and incisiveness. I enjoyed our discussions and arguments very much, and they were very important in helping me revise
the thesis.
I began my studies at the ANU in 2003 as a member of an interdisciplinary
project ‘Chanted Tales from Highland New Guinea’ (funded by the Australian Research Council), of which Alan Rumsey was the lead Chief Investigator. Being
a member of this project provided me with some additional funds for fieldwork
and translation, and gave me the opportunity to take part in some very stimulating workshops and collaborations. Thanks to Alan and also to Don Niles (Partner
iiiivAcknowledgementsInvestigator on the project) for all their hard work in this regard.
The anthropologist Nicole Haley has been working with Duna people since
1994, and was a postdoctoral fellow on the Chanted Tales project. She was instrumental in making this language study happen, and I have benefited greatly from
her experience and hard work. Nicole organised the establishment of the ANU research base at Rewapi, introduced me to the people who were pivotal to my study
of Duna, and facilitated Kenny Kendoli and Richard Alo’s trips from PNG to Canberra. I was able to use some recordings that Nicole made in 2003 as part of my
data set, and am grateful for this important contribution to my work.
The ethnomusicologist Kirsty Gillespie also joined the Chanted Tales project
in 2003, and was awarded her doctorate this year for her research into creativity
and change in Duna song. She has been an inspiring colleague and a warm and
supportive friend. Kirsty made a number of excellent recordings of spoken Duna
texts in 2005 (listed in Appendix 1) and made these available for my use. These
have greatly added to the richness and quality of data I had available for analysis,
and include some of my favourite stories. There are also several language structures
and subtleties that I would have missed entirely were it not for Kirsty’s study of song
texts while we were in the field. It was great to work together and I look forward to
doing so again.
I am grateful to my fellow students in the linguistics department at RSPAS, in
particular Carol Priestley and Antoinette Schapper, for their reading recommendations, problem-solving suggestions, thought-provoking discussions, and comradeship. I only hope I can be half as enlivening and encouraging in Antoinette’s final
thesis months as she has been in mine. Extra thanks also to Bevan Barrett for always
answering my sudden random questions with poise and acuity, and to Susan Love
and Doug Marmion for their technical help.
Many other scholars contributed to my research through their advice, discussion,
and encouragement at various times during my candidature. I am indebted to Alexandra Aikhenvald, Avery Andrews, Chris Ballard, Tom Ernst, Glenda Giles, Rachel
Hendery, Darja Hoenigman, Pascale Jacq, Gabriel Lomas, Elizabeth Minchin, Nick
Modjeska, Don Niles, Stephen Pattemore, Hans Reithofer, Bambi Schieffelin and
Dan Seeland. Discussing issues of evidentiality with Robyn Loughnane was especially stimulating and helpful for me, and I thank her for her insights and suggestions. The attendees at the Monday morning Research Roundtable meetings at
ANU helped to get me through some dark thesis days.
I am indebted to Kevin Murphy, Esther Fasnacht, and Esther’s late husband
Pierre, for their kindness and openheartedness in looking after me while I was in
Mt. Hagen, sending treats to the field, and taking care of my family members who
were able to visit. Kevin’s generosity in sharing his home made it possible for me
to stay and work in Hagen for an extended period when access to Lake Kopiago
was difficult, and I don’t know what I would have done without him. Pierre gave so
much in his life, and I am lucky to have known him and his family. Thanks also to
the other pilots, ground crew and office staff of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship,
and the staff at the Mt Hagen Missionary Home. These dedicated and hard-working
people solved a lot of problems for me, not to mention keeping me cheerful. Like
so many other PNG researchers, I also thank Jim Robins of the National Research
Institute in Port Moresby.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

Textual material suggests that in multivalent clauses involving animate, definite,
and discourse prominent participants, the use of dependent pronouns can bear the
burden of ‘subject identification’ to some extent.44 Example (439) shows a clause
with high semantic transitivity in which the object and subject arguments are equally
animate. The subject argument is referenced with an NP that includes a dependent
pronoun. This example shows a situation in which CS-marking of the A argument
NP would be preferred (if not obligatory) in less contextualised utterances (for example, constructed sentences or ‘bare’ elicited data for which context has not been
imaginatively developed or imported from a real-life situation).

(T/YS:KG05V7.22)
Example (440) shows a textual excerpt in which the third person subject of
ngua- ‘give’ is referenced by an NP that includes an unmarked dependent pronoun;
in bare elication contexts, subject NPs in clauses headed by this verb were consistently CS-marked.

The association of dependent pronouns with the subject argument of a clause is
further illustrated by the constructed examples shown in (441) and (442). Example
(441) shows an acceptable sentence, in which the subject NP, Kenika is CS-marked
and the object NP, Melone Jetine, is unmarked. Example (442) shows the same
sentence with the dual third person pronoun kheno included as a dependent form in
the object NP; KK rejected this as nonsensical.

"196Chapter 6. NP, PP, and PlcP morphologyThere are no examples in my data of -kuru combining with the interrogative pa‘query’ to form an interrogative meaning ‘what places?’ (or similar). However,
the form pa-kuru does occur in the textual data in a specialised construction that
is used to describe mysterious or extraordinary places, typically those that are the
realm of pikono narrative (§1.3.3.1) and can never be known by people in ordinary,
everyday way. Pakuru follows a verbal clause (predication ‘X’) in a phrase that
means something like ‘places where X happens’. Two examples are shown in (369)
and (370).28 In (369), the speaker describes how a woman in a story (who has
wandered off, flouting the express orders of her brother) is charmed by a water spirit
and led down into his mysterious world of underground rivers (see Haley 2002). In
(370), the hero of a pikono story takes leave of his beautiful female companion,
going off on a journey of his own into distant regions of the pikono world.

6.4.4Other ways of denoting locationsIn this section I describe some further kinds of referring expressions that denote
times and places, in order to give a fuller picture of how description of spatial and
temporal locations can be included in a clause.
28I find this construction difficult to analyse, and to do so would require a more comprehensive
analysis of Duna (including further examination of complex sentences) than is attempted in this
thesis. However, I believe it is suggestive of a relationship between the interrogative root pa and
the ‘individual standpoint’ marker pa that occurs as a verbal inflection (§9.3.2.1). Briefly, it makes
sense to interpret the interrogative root ‘query’ and the predicate marker ‘INDV’ as (deriving from)
a single form pa which is concerned with not knowing. This is commensurate with the occurrence
of forms such as -ra ‘SHRD’ as both an epistemic demonstrative and a predicate marker. The interrogative function of pa (‘query’) relates to the epistemic demonstrative function of forms such as
-ra, and indicates that the referent of a phrase is not known (specifically, not known to the speaker
but assumed to be known to the addressee). When it marks a final predicate, pa (INDV) indicates
that the speaker knows about the predicated activity, but assumes that this is individual knowledge,
not necessarily shared by the addressee. Examples such as (369) and (370) give a window into a
situation where pa is exploited as: a form that is demonstrative-like, as it is followed by the place
phrase marker -kuru in a referring expression; and a marker that affixes to a verb root in a clause that
describes an ‘unknown’ situation.","[224, 225]"

There is one example in my data, shown in (234), in which apoko does not
occur at a point of hesitation and ‘memory scanning’, but is used to indicate that
someone’s identity is not known (as opposed to being momentarily inaccessible).
More data are needed to in order to investigate this kind of use of apoko.

to a single grammatical participant in the clause. For example, the S participant
of a monovalent predicate may correspond to a pair of items that are individually
specified, each being referenced by a distinct NP in what I term a ‘collocation’
construction (§5.4.1). In the other complex structures treated here the NPs have
a different sort of relationship, as they do not denote different individuals that are
conjoined as a unitary participant, but rather provide extra information concerning
the nature or identity of the entity. These include ‘whole-part’ (§5.4.2.1) and inclusory pronominal (§5.4.2.2) constructions, double pronoun NPs (§5.4.2.3), and
adpositional identity expansion (§5.4.2.4).
5.4.1Collocation: detailing pair and group membersIndividual members of pairs and groups can be denoted by adjacent nominals or
NPs. Two nominals may be tightly bound and operate as a single constituent (a
‘pair compound NP’), or adjacent NPs may be more loosely bound and understood
as ‘collocated’ through a conventionalised principle of interpretation, in combination with distinct intonation (‘listing construction’). Prototypically, these two kinds
of collocation have several distinct identifying features, but they are not entirely
discrete structural types; it is more appropriate to think of adjacent referring expressions as being more or less bound rather than strictly one or the other.","[187, 188]"
"8.2. Tense, aspect and event modality (TAM)279and are thus ‘terminal’ inflections.
TAM markers can be grouped together in a number of alternative ways which
cut across the three groups as presented in §8.2.2 - §8.2.4. Different semantic, functional, and formal features of the morphemes compel different articulations of how
they relate to each other. For example, it makes sense to identify TAM markers
that are used in the description of actualised rather than potential events as a discrete group that encodes aspect as the primary organisational parameter, and this is
outlined in §8.2.3.7.
Duna verbs are not marked with pronominal agreement affixes,11 and TAM
markers do not mark person as such (that is, they do not alternate strictly according
to the number and person of certain clausal arguments). However, certain (declarative) TAM markers have a distributional pattern that correlates with subject identity,
and this pattern generally follows ‘conjunct/disjunct’ alignment (§11.2.1.1). The
Duna intentive inflection (§8.2.2.3), promissive inflection (§8.2.3.5), and the special
present inflection of the verb nga- ‘go’ (§8.2.3.6) typically occur with speaker subjects in declarative sentences and addressee subjects in questions (show conjunct
distribution). The prophetic inflection (§8.2.3.3) typically occurs with non-speaker
subjects in declarative sentences and non-addressee subjects in interrogative sentences (shows disjunct distribution).
The conjunct/disjunct pattern is generally concerned with the relationship between
a participant (most commonly S or A) of a verbal clause and the person in the utterance situation who is the epistemic source (Hargreaves 2005) with regard to the
proposition. For example, it is typically sensitive to whether the person in the speech
situation who has (best access to) knowledge of the described event also figures as
an agentive participant in it. The nature and implications of this distributional pattern in Duna are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. For the time-being I focus
in the main on the basic meanings of these TAM markers in declarative sentences,
although a few interrogative examples are also introduced.
Because of the significance of the conjunct/disjunct distributional pattern to
Duna grammar, it is useful to have a quasi-‘person’ term (additional to and cutting across the grammatical categories of first, second, and third person encoded in
the Duna personal pronouns) that refers to the speaker of a declarative sentence, and
the addressee of an interrogative sentence. I use the term ‘informant’ for this kind
of person, following Bickel (2001) (as reported in Bickel and Nichols 2007). Note,
however, that my use of the term informant is not identical to that of Bickel, who
defines informant functionally as “the person whom the speaker supposes or claims
11Foley (2000:377) notes that a lack of such affixes is “relatively uncommon” in languages of
New Guinea.","[307, 308]"

See also §6.3.4.2 for some other examples of P arguments that are realised as
LOC -marked NPs.
4.1.4Trivalent clausesTrivalent clauses are headed by a predicate that semantically requires three participants. The few trivalent predicates that I know of in Duna10 can be generally characterised as ‘transfer’ events, so that the participants include something (concrete
or abstract) that is transferred, somewhere that it is transferred to, and something
that effects the transfer. I refer to the item that fills the ‘transferer’ slot in a trivalent
clause as the A argument (equivalent to the A argument of bivalent clauses), the
transferred item as the T (theme) argument, and the item it is transferred to as the R
(recipient) argument.
T and R arguments can be realised as unmarked NPs or have zero anaphoric
reference (§4.2.3.3). An R argument may alternatively be realised as a LOC-marked
NP.
Three examples of trivalent clauses are shown in (57) to (59). In each example
all three arguments are realised in the clause as nominal phrases. The R argument

order when both R and T are expressed in the clause as unmarked NPs.

Example (443) shows (442) with the CS-marked NP removed. KK judged that
Melone Jetine =kheno could not be interpreted as an object NP, but could easily be
understood as a subject NP in which the object NP was elided, as shown in (443b).
Other speakers made similar judgements concerning other structurally comparable
examples, typically rejecting the use of dependent pronouns in object NPs, and
readily identifying any NP that included a dependent pronoun as a subject argument.

b. Melo-ne Jeti-ne =kheno so.

Judgements such as those illustrated in (442) and (443) suggest that dependent
third person pronouns function as nominative (or at least non-accusative) markers.
However, the more highly contextualised data shows that dependent pronouns do
sometimes occur in object NPs. This reference strategy typically coincides with
pragmatic prominence of the NP, in that it represents a highly noteworthy piece of
information.45
Example (444) shows a constructed sentence in which the inclusion of a dependent pronoun in an object NP was judged acceptable. The hypothetical context
for this example is that the addressee has been hassling the speaker to give them a
particular object; the speaker tersely draws the addressee’s attention to the fact that
she has already given the item to someone else.

Example (933) indicates that -rape has some facility to supply ‘extra’ epistemic
information following a finite verb form in the same way that evidentials can, suggesting that markers of epistemic assessment can in general be ‘stacked’ in any
logically tenable order. The context surrounding (933), the apparent ungrammaticality of (932), and the general rarity of this structure in the data suggests that this
particular construction is pragmatically highly marked and is used to cast doubt
on another’s veracity, rather than for the speaker to express doubt about their own
experience. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation.
10.2.4Specificity marking on finite verbs10.2.4.1IntroductionThe specificity marker -na can be added following verbs that are inflected as stative
(§10.2.4.2) or following a (personal) evidential marker (§10.2.4.3) . There is some
evidence that -na can also be added following the standpoint information status
markers -pa and -ra (§10.2.4.4). The specificity marker highlights the proposition
and/or the evidence that is available for it as certain, pertinent and noteworthy, exemplifying the typical emphatic and attention grabbing functions it has when occurring on independent verbal clauses in general (§9.3.2.2, §10.2.2).
10.2.4.2Stative inflection and -naExamples of the specificity marker following verbs that are inflected as stative are
shown in (934) - (936). The specificity marker stresses the immediacy, verifiability,
and relevance of the predicated state.

3the final vowel a in the CS form. In at least the first and second person singular
forms, there is also a regular tonal difference in that (pronounced in isolation) nonCS forms no and ko have a ‘Fall’ contour and CS forms na and ka have a ‘Convex’
contour (§2.2.2). First and third person pronouns fluctuate as to whether contrasted
subject marking consists of a stem change only, or a stem change in combination
with the regular CS marker -ka. For example, in reference to a first person dual
contrasted subject the forms kena and kenaka are both used.37
In its ‘actor-distinguishing’ capacity, CS-marking typically occurs on: subject
NPs of multivalent clauses with an animate or highly individuated object (one of
the features typically associated with high semantic transitivity, cf. Hopper and
Thompson (1980)); and on low animacy subjects of any multivalent predicate.
Examples (409) - (414) show clauses headed by the verb sa- ‘hit, kill’, a Duna
primary transitive verb (Andrews 1985). In elicitation, CS-marking is judged to
be obligatory on the subject NP of this verb, as shown by the ungrammaticality of
(412) and (413). If no other NP occurs in a clause headed by sa-, an NP that is not
CS -marked will be interpreted as an object argument, as shown in (414).38 Overtly
marking the subject NP can thus be crucial to identifying a referent as A (an actor),
not P (an undergoer).

"3.5AdjectivesI refer to a group of Duna words that have formal features of both nominal and
verbal roots and generally describe properties of things as adjectives. Like nominals and unlike verbs, adjectives can occur as clausal predicates in bare root form
(§4.1.1.2). They may also occur as modifiers in nominal phrases (§5.2.2). Adjectival
roots can be inflected with some morphology that is not available to nominal roots,
for example the habitual inflection -na (see, for example, (50)). Certain adjectives
can occur in a complex predicate construction with the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, describing the inception or achievement of a change of state (§7.5.4.3).15
Some examples of Duna adjectives are shown in Table 3.7. I have grouped together adjectives that have some semantic features in common (for example, dealing
with dimension), but I do not propose that each group represents a distinct category.
The forms in Table 3.7 represent the four ‘core semantic types’ that are typically associated with the word class adjective (dimension, age, value and colour), as well as
the ‘peripheral semantic types’ of physical property and human propensity (Dixon
2004).
As can be seen in Table 3.7, many adjectival words finish with a sequence Vo. In
Duna as spoken in the Kopiago area, the final o is subject to deletion in some lexical
items with no clear change in meaning or function.16 It is highly likely that this
final o is a semi-fossilised reflex of the perfective verbal inflection, -o (§8.2.2.1).17
13Note that I designate these forms as members of a particular word class rather than as constituents that are occupying a particular structural/functional position in construction with a verb.
This Duna word class could also be termed that of ‘coverbs’, following the use of this term in the
Australianist literature.
14
As a general rule, if the root is not attested occurring with final verb morphology (or has been
judged unacceptable in combination with it), typically occurs in bare root form, and immediately
precedes a consonantal or wa-class verb in all known examples, I interpret it as a verb adjunct, not a
verb.
15
The root kete ‘small’ can additionally be used in adverbial expressions (see, for example, (425)).
However this is not a general characteristic of adjectival roots.
16
Results of the orthography survey carried out with Duna speakers from the Kelabo area suggest
that deletion of the o is not acceptable for speakers of the south-west Duna variety.

inceptive or progressive meaning (e.g., ‘become big’, ‘become yellow’) and that the
perfective inflection was added to indicate complete achievement of the specified
change. This can also be argued for those adjectival roots that end in u, as the
perfective inflection has an allomorph -u.
Some adjectival roots, such as kete ‘small’, typically occur in nominal phrases
whereas others such as rakare ‘cold’ typically occur as predicates of verbal clauses.
The latter term can be negated with the negative circumfix na- -ya (§8.3), whereas
the former cannot. The behaviour of all adjectival roots with respect to this property
is not known. However, it is likely that further study will provide formal evidence
for the existence of different noun-like and verb-like classes within the proposed
group of adjectival roots, primarily relating to a distinction between properties that
are more time-stable, and those that are more dynamic.","[109, 110]"
"11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity437ation is unexpected and not of their own making, as in (1090).

The use of a visual evidential as a distancing device may also be appropriate for
reasons of politeness. For example, on one occasion I went for a walk by myself
and inconsiderately entered someone else’s garden without their permission. On
my return to the house, Haya Suku questioned where I had been, and asked me to
describe the garden that I had trespassed upon. I replied that it had a guava tree in it,
using the stative form of the verb ka- ‘be/stand’, kei, to describe the tree’s existence.
Haya reprovingly corrected this to the visual stative form karua. Upon my repetition
of this form, she praised me for speaking properly. Presumably, Haya found my use
of kei to be presumptuous in this case. I should not have been in a position to assert
the existence of this tree in the first place, and it was more appropriate for me to
back off, and describe the contents of the garden as an outside observer.
As is intimated by this incident, a speaker may also choose not to use an evidential where it would be semantically apposite, in order to assert a close relationship
with the subject or activity of the predicate. For example, in relating rindi malu
(‘land history/geneaology’, see §1.3.3.1) the speaker avoids evidentially marked
morphemes which may effectively reduce their connection to the (true) events they
relate. In identifying a particular (extant but not at the time visible) tree or stone
as the marker of an important site (such as the site of the death of an ancestor), the
speaker will not use the visual evidential -rua on the existential verb, even though
this may be appropriate from a purely ‘information source’ point of view. Similarly they will not use notional previous evidentials (§9.2.6.3) when describing the
lives of their ancestors (though, strictly speaking, they may be known about from
third-hand type sources), opting instead for the evidentially unmarked perfective
inflection -o (§8.2.2.1). This inflection, by default at least, carries connotations of
the speaker’s personal involvement in the narrated events (§9.2.9).
De Haan (2005) argues that evidentiality should be understood as a deictic category, that “fulfills the same function for marking relationships between speakers
and actions/events that, say, demonstratives do for marking relationships between
speakers and objects”. In accordance with this view, the examples looked at in this
section suggest that Duna evidential marking is part of a deictic practice as discussed by Hanks (2005), which speakers may engage in “not to position objects [or438Chapter 11. Final morphology and sentence typeactions/events] but to position themselves”.
11.2.2.7SummaryUsing an evidential marker on a final predicate implies that the informant is an observer of rather than a volitional participant in the event that is described. Evidential
markers thus have a particular subject identity implication: if a sentence is evidentially marked, the subject is probably not the speaker (in declarative sentences) and
is probably not the addressee (in interrogative sentences). However this is not a
strict entailment, and does not constitute a subject agreement system. Disruptions
in this typical pattern may relate to whether or not the informant did something unknowingly, is relating a dream, or is casting the addressee as perceiver for pragmatic
effect. Evidential markers can further imply an informant’s general disassociation
with the predicate activity and those who participate in it.
11.2.3
11.2.3.1Intentive and prophetic inflections
IntroductionThe intentive inflection -nda (§8.2.2.3) and prophetic inflection -na (§8.2.3.3) are
both used in describing future events, without any specification as to the immediacy
of these events (that is, unlike complex final inflections with -nda, see §10.2.2.2).
The morphemes are not systematically contrastive in that they are not formally equivalent (for example, the intentive is semi-finite and combines freely with ancillary
markers whereas the prophetic generally does not) and their semantics are not neatly
comparable (that is, they do not encode different values of a single semantic parameter). However, the distribution of the intentive and prophetic inflections follows
the conjunct/disjunct pattern quite closely, the intentive being a conjunct form and
the prophetic a disjunct form. The exception to this is in questions with third person
subjects, where the intentive is the more usual form. The typical distribution of the
intentive inflection -nda and prophetic inflection -na in declarative and interrogative
sentences is summarised in Table 11.4.
Table 11.4 Typical distributional pattern of intentive and prophetic inflectionsDeclarative Interrogative
Subject

addresseeIntentive
PropheticProphetic
IntentiveAs a starting point for comparison, I find it helpful to think of these morphemes as entailing ‘perceivers’ similar to those entailed by evidential markers (see11.2. Predicate morphology, sentence type, and subject identity439§9.2.2.2). Both the intentive and prophetic inflections imply the experience of an
event by conscious (typically human) entities. The intentive inflection focusses on
how an irrealis event is currently perceived by a particular individual as an intention or plan. The event may or may not come to be actualised, but the plan of it
exists. The prophetic inflection focusses on the fact that an event will manifest and
be perceived by unspecified people in the future. Duna speakers’ free translations
of prophetic predications (see comments at §8.2.3.3) suggest that this perception is
assumed to be visual in nature. The perception entailed by the prophetic inflection
is also impersonal (§9.2.7) as it is not necessarily tied to a known individual in the
speech situation. The sense of the prophetic inflection can thus be approximated as
‘it will be seen that...’.
With respect to viewpoint shift (§11.2.2.1) in declaratives and interrogatives,
the intentive morpheme behaves similarly to the evidential markers as described in
§11.2.2, that is, the perceiver is typically identified with the speaker in declaratives
and the addressee in interrogatives. The prophetic inflection does not show this alternation; as the inflection does not entail a specific perceiver who holds a locatable
viewpoint, there is no clear viewpoint shift.
11.2.3.2Declarative distributionIn declarative sentences that describe future events, the intentive inflection typically
marks predicates with speaker subjects as in (1091) and (1092), and the prophetic
inflection typically marks predicates with addressee or third person subjects, as in
(1093) and (1094), respectively. Typically, a speaker has a personal plan of their
own future activities, and the intentive inflection is highly suitable to a speaker
subject predication. However, a speaker does not claim this ‘insight’ concerning the
activities of others, and these can be more appropriately described through reference
to impersonal future observation, that is, with the prophetic inflection.

"2908.2.3.7Chapter 8. Final verb morphology: time, event modality, and negationComment on aspectual oppositionsComrie (1976) proposes a general classification of aspectual oppositions as shown
in Figure 8.2. The first order distinction is whether an event is viewed ‘from the
outside’ as a whole (perfective), or from the inside, as something that has distinct
internal temporal structure (imperfective). Within the super-ordinate category of
imperfective, the habitual is contrasted with the continuous. Comrie defines the
habitual positively, as having to do with situations that are “characteristic of an extended period of time, so extended in fact that the situation referred to is viewed not
as an incidental property of the moment but, precisely, as a characteristic feature
of the whole period” (1976:28). Continuity is defined negatively, as imperfectivity that is not habituality (1976:26). Continuity can be further distinguished as to
whether or not the internal temporal structure of the event is progressive (dynamic,
changing, accomplishing) or non-progressive (unchanging, non-accomplishing).

events, Comrie’s framework exhaustively accounts for each distinction that is inflectionally encoded on the verb (with the exception of ngui, ‘go.PRES’, §8.2.3.6).
This mapping of the Duna inflections to Comrie’s framework is represented in Figure 8.3, with Comrie’s terms shown in italics. We can view this as a mini-system
within the larger array of primary inflectional forms. Markers that fall under the
Continuous node are those that are always used in reference to present-time events;
see also §9.3.2.3.

semantic basis that they describe involuntary experience (cf. Pawley et al. 2000).
As the subject argument in clauses headed by involuntary experience predications
in non-volitional, some morphological operations (for example, CS-marking of the
subject argument, see §6.6.1) and typical structural restrictions (for example, the
dispreference for evidential marking in a clause with an informant subject, see
§11.2.2) are not maintained as typical correlates of subject identity.
The different kinds of complex predicates that describe involuntary experience
can generally be identified as structurally analogous (to at least some extent) with
one of the constructions described in §7.4 or §7.5. Sections §7.6.1.1 and §7.6.1.2
describe two kinds of predications that are composed of a noun in combination with
a verb, and show some similarities to the adjunct noun and object-verb predications
described in §7.5.2 and §7.5.3, respectively. In §7.6.2.1 I look at four ‘involuntary
experience expressions’ which are perhaps derived from verb adjunct predications,
but show features suggestive of lexicalisation as nominal/verbal roots in at least two
cases. Section 7.6.2.2 examines clauses that include ‘emotion words’, which can
function as either verbal roots, or as nominal roots in construction with a verb.
7.6.1
7.6.1.1Noun + verb
Bodily substance + verb of motionSome involuntary experiences are expressed by a noun or NP in combination with
one of the consonantal motion verbs nga- ‘go’ or hoa- ‘come’. Typically these
predications describe involuntary release of bodily substances such as blood, tears,7.6. Complex predicates that describe involuntary experience259or faeces. Known phrases of this type are shown in Table 7.11 and exemplified in

It is possible for the same combination of verbs to vary according to context as
to whether they show a purposive or overlapping relationship. In (502) and (503)
the relationship between the verbs yaki ‘carry’ and nga- ‘go’ is overlapping and purposive, respectively. These sentences were elicited/constructed around two different
hypothetical scenarios that were elaborated and reiterated throughout one elicitation
session. One scenario was that the speaker had been digging out peanuts (example
(502)), and one was that someone else’s (Kipu’s) whereabouts were being queried
and explained (example (503)). In real situations there is likely to be further physical evidence (for example, a bag full of peanuts) that supports the apt interpretation
of a formally ambiguous sentence.

7.3.3.3Integrated activities and lexicalisationIn some verb series it is semantically or logically problematic to distinguish the
verbs as representing separable activities; rather, the combination of two verbs
seems to describe one activity. These combinations are usually highly lexicalised,
so that the meaning of this activity is only partly predictable from the individual
meanings of the verbs.11 Some integrated activity and/or highly lexicalised serial
verb combinations are shown in Table 7.3 and exemplified in (504) - (510).
Examples (504) and (505) show the expression ke- ra- (lit. ‘see be/put’) which
refers to studying something attentively. In (504), Sane Noma explains his theory
that Europeans designed helicopters after observing the distinctive way a dragonfly
flies, that is, hovering at stationary points along a zig-zag path of travel. In (505)
Kenny Kendoli describes going to inspect and size up some land that he was thinking of developing as a house and garden site.
11I use apparent complete contemporaneity of action, and/or semantic opaqueness as criteria for
saying that a particular verb series is integrated and/or lexicalised. However, these are subjective
judgements concerning gradient attributes, so do not necessarily equate to distinctions that are clearly
encoded in Duna grammar or semantics.",[261]
"Chapter 3Word classes
3.1IntroductionThis chapter introduces Duna word classes as referred to in this thesis, identifying
different groups to which a root form may belong, and which predict certain aspects
of a word’s use, including its distribution, function, and structural capacities. The
chapter includes some additional comments on features of certain word classes or
subclasses that are not discussed in detail elsewhere in this thesis, and lists all known
members of smaller closed classes for quick reference.
The word types I present here are largely categories that can be defined on the
basis of morphosyntactic characteristics. For example, roots that belong to the class
of verbs can be marked with certain bound forms that are not generally applicable to
the members of other classes. However, the types are functionally and semantically
as well as formally motivated, and in some cases no clearly distinguishing morphosyntactic features are identified; certain words are presented together because they
belong to the same kind of semantic domain, or share a similar function.
Sections 3.2 and 3.3 describe formal and functional features of the major Duna
word classes, nominals and verbs. Members of the nominal and verb classes are
generally used in denoting entities and events, respectively, and are thus typically
fundamental to establishing fairly basic ingredients of a described situation (who are
the participants, what are they doing?). Nominals are divided into two open classes
(common nouns and proper names), and one closed class, personal pronouns. The
overall category of verb contains three closed classes of morphologically and functionally distinct verbal roots, as well as an open class of regular verbs.
Verb adjuncts (§3.4) are similar to verbs but have somewhat distinct distributional properties, and adjectives (§3.5) comprise a class of words which show both
nominal and verbal properties.
The closed classes of quantifiers and demonstratives are treated in §3.6 and §3.7,
and §3.8 looks at a ‘mixed bag’ of words and expressions that are used in talking
6970Chapter 3. Word classesabout time and manner. Duna interrogative forms (§3.9) group together as a functional class, but also cut across the classes described in §3.2 - §3.8. Sections 3.10
and 3.11 describe some other minor groups of words, including dependent postpositional modifiers, linkers, sentence pro-forms, and some conventionalised utterances
or ‘sound gestures’ such as attention-seekers and exclamations.","[97, 98, 99]"
"6.6NP marking: grammatical relation and prominence6.6.1Contrasted subject (CS) markingA subject NP (§4.2.1) can be formally marked as a ‘contrasted subject’ (CS). There
are two main situations in which it is necessary or appropriate to mark the subject
of a clause as contrasted. One is when there is a need to distinguish the subject NP
from other clausal participants. This situation typically arises in clauses headed by
multivalent predicates, the A argument (usually with an actor semantic role) being
overtly distinguished from other predicated arguments (P, R, T, see §4.2.1); this
use of contrasted subject marking functionally resembles ergative case marking.
Another such situation is when there is a need to distinguish an NP referent from
other referents, for example when the identity of the subject is new, unexpected,
and/or contrasted with the identity of another expected or potential subject; this
latter use resembles focus-marking.35
Singular and dual personal pronouns have special contrasted subject forms, first
listed in §3.2.3 and reproduced here in Table 6.6. Other NPs are marked as contrasted with the postposed bound form -ka. 36
In regard to the singular and dual pronouns, there is a regular relationship between
the non-CS and CS forms in that the final vowel o in the non-CS form changes to
35Duna thus provides another example of a TNG language in which particular marking of an
NP matches ergative distribution to some extent, but cannot be adequately described on a syntactic
basis. See for example Renck (1975), Foley (1986), Scott (1986), Donohue and Donohue (1997),
Donohue (2005), Rumsey (MS), Priestley (2008). As is also fairly common in Papuan languages
(as elsewhere), the ergative-like marker in Duna is homophonous with a morpheme that marks an
instrument-like role.
36
I view contrasted subject marking as NP-internal as it can be expressed by stem alternation
rather than the application of a postposed clitic. However, the CS marker is not a kind of NP marker
as it does not attach directly to a spatial or Class I epistemic demonstratives, and commonly occurs
in combination with -na SPEC. In these two ways the CS marker resembles an NP postposition.",[234]
