"6. 1.2 Interrogative clauses and the word order offocusThe word order of interrogative clauses differs from that of declarative clauses. In an
interrogative clause an interrogative pronoun (illustrated here with amo 'who') will appear in
the preverbal focus position. This is true even if the referent of the question word is the
subject of the clause, and mirrors the ordering of constituents under focus in questions,
mentioned above.
(249)amo b-ei?
Tra
bie
who QSG-do
sago.delight.NM that
[ OBJ ]
[SUBJ] [VERB]
'Who made that sago delight?'",[105]
"6.1 Word orderrsaka clauses and phrases exhibit a quite strict word order, though there are pragmatic
alternatives for many constructions. This section starts with an overview of clausal word
order, and then proceeds into noun phrases. This order of presentation has been chosen to
follow the possibilities for adjectives, which can in many instances appear outside the NP of
the noun they modify.",[103]
"Morphology57I n these examples Duwe Damien-ka functions as the predicate, and the possessor Damien
appears with the dative suffix. Similarly, in the second sentence pa i is marked with the
dative suffixes as a possessor. When a possessor appears inside an NP modifying the head
noun this use of dative suffixes is also possible, but it is more common simply to juxtapose
the nouns. While both of the following phrases are possible, the first is more common and
more 'natural' than the second.
(98) a. wei
Damien
house Damien
'Damien's house'
b. wei
Damien-ka
house Damien- 3SG.M.DAT
'Darnien's house'
Note that, regardless of the presence or absence of a dative suffix on the possessor, the
possessor must follow the unmarked possessum.
5.2 Verbal morphologyWhile some morphology is unique to nominals, verbs are the locus of all obligatory
morphology in I'saka, and show both the greatest range and greatest complexity of
morphological forms. I n this section we shall examine the inflection for person that is found
on the verb, following a morpheme template for the verb.
5.2. 1 Morpheme orderingMorphemes are strictly ordered in the verb in I'saka, though the reduplicative element
used to mark irrealis mood applies a template to a segmental string that includes both the root
and the prefix. Section 5 .7.1 discusses some variation in the order of the final morphemes in
this verbal string with sentence final particles. The order of the different morphemes on the
verb is as follows:
SUBJ-VROOT(.OBJ) - (Human OBJ), (EVID) - (DAT)
« IRR»
Subject is obligatorily encoded either prefixally or through suppletion of the verb root,
with different verb stems being used for subjects of differing number or gender. The most
extreme example of this is the verb 'do', which uses apparently completely unrelated forms
- see Table 26. Objects are encoded either suppletively (in which case they determine the
vowel of the syllable reduplicated for irrealis verbs - see §2.4 and §2 . 5 ), or suffixally. It is
not known whether human object suffixes are placed before or after the evident morpheme,
though the semantics of the evident morpheme and the limited class of verbs that can take
human object suffixes would not appear to be compatible. The dative suffix is always placed
word-finally, as in the examples below, which show the dative suffix in combination with the
human object suffix in (99), and the evident temporallrealis morpheme combined with the
dative suffix in (100) (there is, however, some doubt as to the status of the dative suffix as
suffix or as clitic: see § 5 .7.1).","[74, 75]"
"The following example illustrates the apparent unacceptability (at least prescriptively) of a
preverbal object-linked adjective when the postverbal position is empty.
(260)*depu
su
takau n-ou
l SG.NOM sago hot
l SG-eat
'I ate hot sago. '90Chapter 6Although the above pattern is robustly attested (particularly the postverbal placement of
object-linked adjectives), exceptions have been observed. More data is necessary to be sure
of the rules of adjective placement, particularly with reference to the ordering of deictics and
possessive pronouns, and the presence of additional tense/aspect information (e.g. irrealis or
completive morphemes) in the clause. The current data suggests that all these elements are
relevant to adjective ordering.
6. 1. 4 Noun phrase orderThe order of elements in the noun phrase is tightly constrained; when sequences of NP­
elements appear outside this normal ordering, the usual interpretation is that they are not
actually an NP unit, but rather an NP + predicate. Of course, if there is a further predicate,
then the ill-ordered string renders the sentence ungrammatical, or at best the result of false
starts.
Normal (that is, non-elicited) discourse rarely presents any adjectives or relative clauses as
modifiers in the NP (though possessives and demonstratives are not unusual). It is certainly
the case that an NP with all four of the positions listed below have never been attested, nor
are we claiming that they are possible. Based on the observed orders of elements in smaller
NPs, however, we can formulate the normal order of elements in the NP:
(26 1 )NP 0NADJ RC/NUMPOSS/DEMIn many cases the possessor is not marked inside the NP, but rather on the verb of the
clause in the form of dative suffixes. Deictics and possessive pronouns must be placed after
the noun they modify, and following any numerals, but are freely ordered with respect to
each other.
Examples of NPs illustrating these various types of modifiers can be found in the
following clauses (note the variant nua for the more common nuo 'big'):
(262)(263)(264)N - ADJ - DEM
A
nua hie d-o-ma .
pig.M big this l SG-shoot-2SG.DAT
'I shot this big pig of yours. '
N - ADJ - NUM
nua sia.
a
pig.M big two
'two big pigs'
(Note that many modifiers, especially numerals, appear most naturally
separated from the head noun, following the verb, as described in §6. 1 .3 .)
N - RC
B-au,
a
nua [d-o
kelie]
sesing.
2SG-come pig.M big
l SG-shoot yesterday 1 DU:eat-RED
'Come on, let's eat that large pig I shot yesterday. 'Relative clauses have not been observed in conjunction with other modifiers in the NP;
attempts to elicit this sort of structure have been met with biclausal translations, such as 'TheSyntax91big pig there, I shot it yesterday. Let's eat it'. More information on relative clauses is in
§6.8.","[107, 108, 109]"
An A-P-V order is not possible when the subject is a question-word pronoun:88Chapter 6(250)*amo tra ble bei?,"[105, 106]"

followed. A, S and P have been used descriptively to represent the syntactic roles of most
agentive arguments of a primary transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as it does),
single argument of an intransitive predicate, and most patientive argument of a primary
transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as they do), respectively, following Comrie
( 1 978) and Andrews ( 1 985:6 8). The following additional abbreviations are used in the text

the morpheme line: the hyphen '- ' is used to separate morphemes forming one phonological
,
word, and a space ' is used to mark off separate words. Punctuation marks are used
according to English conventions. The usual star ' *' is used to indicate an ungrammatical
utterance, while a hash '#' is used for one that is either infelicitous for a particular context, or
else acceptable only for some speakers, or one about which speakers vacillate in their
judgements from time to time.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"
"6. 1. 1 Declarative word orderThe basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOY, with Oblique participants
(including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the
verb (these include nominals bearing the following semantic roles: instrument, companion,
recipient, beneficiary, goal, and location, and also possessor of P). If more than one oblique
is present, then goal and location will follow other peripheral arguments. Temporals are
usually clause-initial.

"1 0 Word lists and list of
grammatical morphemesNo lexicographic materials are available in popular print for the I'saka language, and it is
unlikely that they will appear in the near future. Partly in order to counter this dearth of
materials, we have included some word lists of the basic elements of the language.
We have presented a comprehensive basic word list in § 1 0. 1 , followed in § 1 0.2 by several
lists of species names and natural world terms. These are words which have been recorded by
Willy Wou Wake, of Krisa village. Some of these terms were not checked, and have been
presented in Willy's orthography as he wrote it. These are listed in a different font,
appearing sans serif: the word list that has been checked appears in italics, as a checked
form, following the conventions used for transcribing other I'saka sentences in this book.
Following this is an alphabetically sorted list of these same words, and a short summary
of the grammatical morphemes in the language, including references to where they are
discussed.","[126, 127]"
"Deviations from the word order presented here are rare, although preverbal constituents
are occasionally found either at the end of the clause for emphasis, or in the pragmatically
marked preverbal 'focus' position in which elements are pragmatically salient, and, with the
exception of nominals or pronouns that simply double a clause-external topic, do appear to be
necessarily focused. This is most commonly found if that constituent is the answer to a
content question. Furthermore, there is a pre-sentential topic position, which is filled with
any NP (subject, object, or an oblique) from the clause. The topic NP in the main clause can
optionally be doubled in the clause, in the preverbal focus position (unless the clause contains
another argument with the pragmatic function 'focus').
(24 1 )S'�NPTO P S(lNP)Note that an NP in the topic position retains its normal case-marking possibilities, as seen
in the following examples:
(242)(243)(244)SUBJ as topic:
Dapu,
a
hIe dapu
n-ou.
1 SG.NOM pig.M that 1 SG.NOM 1 SG-eat
'Me, I want to eat (some of) that pork.'
Dupu,
kelia
n-oru .
1 PL.NOM yesterday 1 PL-come
'We came yesterday.'",[104]
"6. 1.5 Non-verbal predicatesThe word order in non-verbal predicates parallels that found in verbal predicates in terms
of the functions of the elements of the clause. The predicative noun or adjective is found in
the same final position, just as the verb is in verbal clauses, and the subject of the predicate is
again in initial position.
Examples of these predicates have already been given in the sections on nouns and
adjectives, and some additional examples are shown in the following sentences:
(265)Kia
sami dina.
3SG.M WF
I SG.POSS
'He's my father-in-law.'",[109]
"6SyntaxIn this section we shall discuss various basic elements of the syntax of rsaka that are not
easily described in terms of morphological possibilities or morphological restriction. These
include the word order of elements of the clause and of the noun phrase, and some simple
features of clausal conjunction. By no means are the syntactic structures of rsaka
completely described in this section, but rather only a small and immediately salient selection
of constructions are presented, selected more for their frequency of appearance than
necessarily for their typological unusualness.","[102, 103]"
"6. 1.3 Ordering of adjectivesAdjectives exemplify a more complex and changeable set of ordering rules, with speakers
varying with respect to adjective usage. Essentially, in addition to appearing inside the NP in
which a nominal occurs, an adjective can also be found postverbally; this is a quite frequent
strategy. The two options for word order can be seen in the following sentences. In the first
sentence we can see an NP with both the noun and the adjective inside it. I t occurs
preverbally, as we would expect of a P.

"3.1 Major word classesNouns and verbs are the two major word classes, being most obviously morphologically
distinct in that verbs show agreement and nouns do not, even when predicative. This can be
seen in the following pair of sentences, in which the verb -oung 'eat' appears with a prefix
that agrees with the subject of the clause, while tisa in (44), a noun, shows no such prefix,
nor other (more plausible) morphology which is the norm on verbs.
(43)Verbal predicate: agreement
sit
n-ou-ma.
Depu
I SG.NOM sago I SG-eat-2SG.DAT
'I ate your sago. '(44)Nominal predicate: no agreement
tisa(*-na).
Depu
I SG.NOM teacher(- l sG.DAT)
'I 'm a teacher. 'At least five further distinct classes can be distinguished. These include Adjectives,
Temporals, Deictics, Clause-relevant particles and Postpositions.
The Adjective class (including quantifiers) displays elements of the morphological
characteristics of both nouns and verbs. Like verbs, adjectives may encode arguments with
the dative suffix. However, like nouns (and unlike verbs), they show no agreement for
person, number and gender of subject or object.

'He's young. 'Adjectives are phonologically distinct from verbs in that they most commonly begin with
consonants, not vowels. This alone would account for the lack of subject agreement on these
words, but it does not explain the consistent correlation between consonant-initial non­
nominal stems and property, rather than action, semantics. Additionally, adjectives (and no
other word classes) may occur with a postposed intensifying particle nil, as in:
(47)nil.
SU

sago good INTENSE
'It's very good sago. 'A further support to the notion that there is a categorial distinction between verbs and
adjectives, and not just a phonological one, is the fact that one verb has been recorded that is
consonant-initial, wopukai 'trick, fool, muck up', which may be used monovalently or
bivalently, and if the latter may appear with dative suffixes marking the P.
(48)wopukai-ma!
Depu
I SO.NOM trick-2so.DAT
'1 fooled you !'","[56, 57]"
"6. 4. 1 AdjacencySubject or object nominals may be conjoined through adjacency in the clause, provided
that, where appropriate, the verb shows agreement for the sum of the features represented by
both constituents. In the first example below the subject of the monovalent verb is the two
nouns moni and tani; they are conjoined in the NP by adjacency, and the verb agrees with the
combined dual category.

mother father 3DU-go Vanimo
'Mum and dad are going to Vanimo. 'The following example shows two nouns conjoined as the object of the clause. Since
objects do not show any agreement (other than the limited set of 'envelopment' verbs and the
light verbs 'do' and 'get' - §5.2.3), there is no overt indication of the shared phrase structure
of the two nouns.
(275)wesie n-ou.
sago greens I SG-eat
'I ate sago and greens.'",[111]
"9Comparison with related
languagesAs mentioned in § 1 . 3 , there are no languages with a particularly close linguistic
relationship to I'saka. Despite this lack of near siblings, I'saka is demonstrably a member of
the Macro-Skou family, as has been seen in Figure 3, and numerous cognates and
paradigmatic matches can be found with languages in other, more populous, branches of this
family (see Donohue 2002a, to appear). In this section some of the similarities between
I'saka and various of the other languages of the family will be described.
Recall from Figure 3 in § 1 . 3 that I'saka is a first-order subgroup within the Macro-Skou
family. As such, there are not many cognates with any one language from the other branch
of Macro-Skou, but taken as a whole there are quite a few. Table 30 presents a non­
exhaustive list of representative examples, with the non-I'saka words shown in IPA .

"10. 1 Basic I'saka word listThe following list of basic lexemes is given as a guide to the lexical diversity of the
language, and as an aid to comparative work. It is not intended to be exhaustive (nor is it),
but it does contain a good deal of lexical material that is not accessible through other sources,
and so represents a valuable contribution to studies of New Guinea languages.
The list has been arranged by semantic fields, and is intended to cover as much of a basic
survey word list as possible, with these items appearing first within each semantic domain,
followed by a selection of more specialised items. Verbs appear inflected for first person
singular, with the prefix d- or, if the initial syllable of the verb root is nasalised, n- (§5.2.2),
since this makes the representation of nasalisation in an initial syllable most simple. Where
known, the gender of the noun has been indicated, with masculine nouns marked by 'M ', and
non-masculine marked with 'NM '. All examples appear in the orthography described in §2.7;
the phonological forms may be reconstructed from these orthographic representations with no
ambiguities.
The abbreviations used in the section on kin terms follow standard anthropological usage,
and can be summarised as follows: C - child, D - daughter, e - elder, F - father, H - husband,
M - mother, P - parent, S - son, Si - sibling, ss - same-sex, os - opposite sex, Sp - spouse,
W - wife, y - younger, Z - sister. These may be used in combinations such that each operator
applies t9 the following term. As an examples of this, the gloss CSp for duwoko indicates
that the term can be used for a child's spouse. Some terms cover reference of what would be
1 091 10Chapter 1 0conceived of as two separate categories in English, such as PP, CC yani', which covers both
grandparents (of either sex, thus in English both grandfather and grandmother) and
grandchildren. Clearly the relevant characteristic in I ' saka is that the referent is two
generations removed from Ego.
The following word list is organised into the following categories (in order of
presentation): Body parts, Humans and kin terms, Pronouns, Animals, Plants, Natural world,
Human artefacts, Location, Colours, Counting, Properties, Verbs, Miscellaneous.

"3.3 VerbsVerbs in I'saka are the most highly restricted word class in terms of their phonotactic
possibilities. This can be seen in the fact that all verbal roots are unexceptionally vowel­
initial, which functionally serves to accommodate the obligatory consonantal prefixation that
is found on all verbs (in both finite and non-finite constructions). This means that the
following possibilities are found for the segmental phonotactics on verb roots:Word classes41Table 19: Phonotactic shape of verbsshape

1 -0--0Verbs can be maximally inflected for three referents (subject, object and dative) and for
one mood distinction through reduplication. I n addition to these compulsory inflectional
categories, several other verbal morphemes have been observed, mainly encoding aspectual
information, but these occur only rarely in normal speech and texts. They are described in
§5 . 3 .
Examples o f verbs in use with the obligatory pronominal inflection are given in the
following sentences.

"2Chapter 1more likely candidates for genetic relatedness to I'saka than is Asmat or any of its relatives.
Morphologically, I'saka shows more similarities with the Melanesian Austronesian pattern
than the 'typical' Papuan pattern (that is, the highlands Trans New Guinea pattern that is
usually evoked when referring to Papuan languages), with strict word order, no case-marking
particles, and relatively simple morphology. Syntactically, I'saka is mainly right-headed at
the clause level, but left-headed within the NP, as is to be expected (Dryer 1 98 8). The
language makes extensive use of light verbs (§5.3 . 1 , 5 . 3 .2), sometimes with a semantically
specifying nominal, and sometimes without, relying on either discourse-contextual knowledge
or on shared cultural knowledge concerning the activities performed with different things to
resolve ambiguities. These points will all be examined in detail from Chapter 2 on, following
a discussion of the sociolinguistic factors that are at play in the Krisa community.
1.1BackgroundThe village of Krisa is situated approximately 20km south of Vanimo, the capital of
Sandaun Province (formerly West Sepik), in the extreme north-west of Papua New Guinea.
The location of Krisa and Pasi with respect to the local provincial capital of Vanimo, and the
closer town of Ossima in the Pual river basin, is shown in Figure 1 . The villages north of the
Oenake range represent those that speak languages related to I 'saka in the (smaller) Skou
family, from Skou Mabo in the west through to Vanimo. Between the Bewani mountains and
this range, along the course of the Pual river, are the languages of the Bewani (Border
languages) group, unrelated to the Skou languages. In the Bewani mountains to the southeast
are some northern hamlets of Fas-speaking peoples such as Yo, relatives of whom have
spilled over into the Serra Hills in the last few decades, but these areas remain sparsely
populated.

•Figure 1: Map of Krisa and surrounding villages and the I'saka language areaIntroduction3The village is on the southern end of a plateau split by numerous small rivers at an altitude
of approximately 300-400m, and looks south across the Pual valley to the Bewani mountains
(see Figure 1 ). The location of Krisa and its surrounds in a broader New Guinea context is
shown in Figure 2. In this map the shaded area represents the area of the map seen in
Figure 1 .
Krisa can be reached by a four-hour walk along a dirt road from Pasi, which is accessible
by vehicle from Vanimo. The population of the village itself numbers approximately 600
(more than half of whom are children), and nearly the same number of people live in
outlying settlement camps that follow the road to the coast (Klappa 1 99 9a, 1 999d),
terminating in Pasi, the last I'saka-speaking settlement, which lies just off the northern slopes
of the Oenake ranges. Finally, a few Krisa families live in Vanimo town; no Krisa people
live further away than the surrounding villages, where they are found due to marriage to
Osol, Osima or Ningera. This yields a total possible population for the ethnic group of
somewhat less than 1 000.","[19, 20, 21]"
"These words represent something of a conundrum for morphological analysis, as it is
impossible to tell with certainty whether or not they are inflected for subject. Inanimates
normally take 3SG.NM inflection on verbs, but the inflection for 3SG.NM on many verbs is
irregular (see §5 .2.2 and Chapter 8). The fact that these verbs of location begin with [t] and74Chapter 5[s] (which are probably etymologically related - see §2.3 .4) is suggestive of productive
inflection for 3SG.NM, at least historically. This is because a large proportion of verbs with
suppletive 3SG.NM forms are t-initial for 3SG.NM (e.g. tu 3SG.NM come).
Occurrences of the verb siakai such as that in ( 1 67) do not show variation for number, as
is illustrated by the following sentence, which has a plural subject:
(1 71)Tei
amopa ni'
siaka lu
wei
tru.
wood many INTENSE be.at be.at house inside
'There's a lot of firewood inside the house. 'Unlike inanimate things, animate subjects are 'located' using postural verbs that
incorporate information about the stance or orientation of the object, such as -ana 'sit', -ung
'be at', etc. (see below). Given this distinction in the verbs, the verbs exemplified above are
perhaps inherently inanimate, rendering subject inflection irrelevant.
There are some instances of the dative suffix occurring on location verbs. In these cases it
encodes the possessor of the sole argument of the verb:
( 1 72)Kap dina-e
sakai-na
wei.
cup 1 SG.POSS-EMPH be.at- 1 SG.DAT house
'My cup is in the (?my) house. '( 1 73)6 sakai-na.
pot be.at- 1 SG.DAT
'That's my pot.'
(or possibly: 'My pot is there.')Examples of this can be found in the following paradigms and sentences, showing
different verbs being used with different nouns, depending on their relation to a human-style
stance or posture. The unmarked verb collocation used to indicate existing for humans, lada!
+ lui 'sit + be.at', inflects as follows (shown with the unmarked pronominal set):
( 1 74)nana n-ana n-u
mama m-ana m-u
kie k-ana k-ung
omu (w)ona sunesing si-na su
lsang s-ana su
esang s-ana sunumu ni-na ku
yumu yi-na ku
ia ina ku/ana kuIt is not the case that different kinds of inanimate nouns are found with the postural verbs,
with the choice of verb acting as a covert classification system (as is seen commonly in other
Papuan languages, e.g. Enga: Lang 1 975). Rather, in I'saka, the postural verbs are used only
to show actual postural alignment for animate arguments that are capable of assuming
different postures, and inanimate arguments, rather than utilising these postural verbs as a
form of classification, simply employ a separate set of verbs. In a sense, then, there is a
classification of nomina Is into animate versus inanimate, but it does not go beyond this. The
one exception involves villages, which are coded as if they were animate, as the following
example shows:
( 1 75)I 'saka
ana ku
i 'tanu.
Krisa.village sit be.at mountain
'Krisa village is on the mountain. 'Here I'saka occurs not with siaka , the verb used to code a n inanimate argument's location.
Despite this ana is not inflected for person or number.","[91, 92]"
"4. 1. 1 Unmarked pronounsThe unmarked pronoun is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, appearing
in a wider range of contexts than any of the other pronominal sets. The referent can be a
subject or dative referent, and at times the unmarked set of pronouns is even used as
possessive pronouns. Additionally, an overtly marked oblique pronoun must be drawn from
the unmarked set (such as accompanying participants, which are marked with tro attached to
a pronoun from the unmarked set, as in (95) in §5 . 1 .2). The only restriction on the function
of this pronominal set is that it may not be used to mark a referent which is the object of a
bivalent clause.
It is not yet well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked pronominal forms
when a more highly specified, and equally suitable pronominal set is available for the
function required, such as the nominative pronouns for subjects or the possessive pronouns
for objects.
Examples of the use of the unmarked pronouns in different syntactic contexts appear in
the sentences below.
(62)(63)(64)(65)Unmarked pronoun as subject of a bivalent clause:
n-ou.
Nana tra
1 SG
sago.delight l SG-eat
'I ate sago delight.'
Unmarked pronoun as dative referent:

book l SG-give-2SG.DAT 2SG
'I gave you the book. '
Unmarked pronoun a s possessor:
�p Nai nana ] b-asa-ke.
2sG-carry-3sG.M.H.OBJ
boy l SG
'You carried my child. '
Unmarked pronoun as un-indexed oblique:
Kapu k-ele '
umu.
3SG.M 3SG.M-go 3SG.NM
'He went to her.'
(The meaning encoded in this sentence would be more commonly
expressed with a dative suffix on the verb: Kapu k-ele-ung 'He went to
her', Kepu k-au-na 'He came to me'.)48Chapter 4From the wide range of functions in which the unmarked set of pronouns appears it is
clear that they are not specified for grammatical features other than the pronominal ones that
they exist to mark.","[65, 66]"
"5.2.3 Object inflectionIndependent bivalent verbs can be divided into two morphologically distinct classes. The
first class, a minority pattern, marks the gender and number (singular/dual being relevantly
grouped together as non-plural, NPL, opposed to plural, PL) of the object on the verb. This
may be accomplished in one of two ways: either through the use of suppletive verb-forms, or
through the use of more delimitable affixation - 'delimitable' in the sense that the
correspondences of pronominal values to the segments employed for their encoding match
the paradigms seen elsewhere. (In fact, calling this 'affixation' may be jumping the gun as
there are too few examples known to be sure that we are really dealing with regular affixes
that mean 'masculine non-plural object', etc., as opposed to patterns of lexical suppletion.)
Table 26 shows two examples of the class of verbs that mark some value of the object by
suppletive verb forms; the examples given here have been inflected for first person singular
subject (d-) as well as the inflection for object. The first example, with the verb -ai 'get' ,
shows what may b e analysable a s object affixes. The rightmost column illustrates the
patterns found with the verb -ei 'do', and shows object-governed suppletion, or at best objectMorphology61affixation and major morphophonological changes. Although the prevalence of suppletive
forms makes it difficult to posit a root for the verb 'do', the third person non-masculine
object form -ei is considered to be the most unmarked, in terms of its range of application,
frequency of occurrence, and appearance in elicitation. As such, it has been treated as the
underlying form throughout.
Table 26: Object prefixes'take, get', [-aj]'do', [-ej]SUBJOBJl SG3NPL.NMd-aid-ei3NPL.Md-akaid-o3PLd-alaid-ouIf the verb 'take' in the table above illustrates a productive (or at least regular, and not
entirely suppletive) object marking pattern, then the morphemes used to index the values of
,
the object are prefixal to the verb root; the morphological structure of 'I take (masculine)
would most logically be PrefsuBJ-PrefoBJ-V, as in the following segmented example.
( 1 07)d-ak-ai
l SG-3SG.NPL.M-take
,
'I take (masculine)Here the use of the k consonant in the prefix is reminiscent of the appearance of this
consonant in various places in paradigms involving third person singular masculine
arguments. We would posit the prefixes ak- and al-, the only consonant-final morphemes in
the language. With 'do', however, it is hard to isolate a single element that can be said to be
added to an otherwise basically invariant verb root. It could well be the case that prefixes of
the form V- and VG- are added and the rhyme of the prefix overwrites that of the verb root,
in a process similar to that described for vowel coalescence when subject prefixes of the
shape CV - are added to verbs (§5 .2.2). If this is the case, the prefixes are 0- '3NPL.M .OBJ'
and ou- 'PL.OBJ' (/'Jw/). An example of the verb 'do' inflected for non-plural masculine
object is given in:
( 1 08)[d'J]
/d-'J-Ej!
l SG.sUBJ-3SG.NPL.M.OBJ-do
'I do (masculine).'
(See §5.2.2 for a discussion of the process of rhyme replacement in verbs
following the syllabification of extrametrical elements, arguing that rather
than simply vowel replacement, there is a more complex process involved.)For ease of glossing, only the features 'plural ' and 'masculine' will be indicated in the
gloss lines, as these seem to represent elements that, historically at least, were added to the
roots. Thus, d-ei will be glossed simply as l sG-do, not l SG-do.NPL.NM ; d-o will be glossed
as l sG-do.M, and d-ou as l sG-do.pL. The features non-singular and non-masculine will not
be explicitly marked in the glosses, as they represent the unmarked categories.
In addition to these verbs with irregular (in the sense of less easily segmentable) means of
marking object values on the verb, a small and semantically distinct subset of this class takes
a regular set of suffixes that indicate number, person and gender of a human object (H .OBJ).","[78, 79]"
"62Chapter 5Those forms that are known are shown in Table 27, followed by some examples. It should
be noted that the human object suffixes bear the same 'signature' person/gender phonemes
(/dI: 1 sG, fb/: 2sG, 1kI: 3 SG.M and /w/: 3SG.NM) as the subject prefixes. These onsets tend not
to lenite intervocalically, implying that there are different degrees of morpheme juncture
involved here, possibly involving c1iticisation, compared to the lenition that occurs when
subject prefixes are reduplicated (support, albeit circumstantial, for this position is the
ambiguity of the position of the dative suffixes when in proximity to the completive marker
- see §S.7. 1 ).
Table 27: Human object suffixes1

3 .M
3 .NMSG
-de
-be
-ke/-ki
-wiDUPL-si
-se?
-ye-l-lExamples of the use of these suffixes can be found in the following sentences; these
represent examples from both of the only two verbs that have been consistently observed to
occur with this set of object markers.
( 1 09)M-opa-wi.

'You carried her on your shoulders. '( 1 1 0)Nai d-esi
d-epa-ki
yang-yang. 2
boy l SG-carry l SG-put-3sG.M.H.OBJ leg-leg
'I 'll hold the boy on my lap. 'All observed occurrences of the human object suffixes are on verbs of carrying and
holding, such as shown with -opa 'carry on shoulder' and -epa 'place (on lap)' in sentences
( 1 09) and ( 1 1 0), and also (not exemplified here) -aisuso 'carry on side, carry on hip' and the
more generic -asa 'carry'. The use of the appropriate object suffix is obligatory in those
constructions exemplified above, and has not been observed, or accepted, with any other
verbs. We might reasonably assume that any bivalent verb that could satisfy the semantic
criteria (which we might define as 'envelopment of an animate (human?) object') would also
combine with the suffixes, but no verbs other than those listed here have been recorded with
the object suffixes. The fact that another verb of carrying, -asei 'carry by attaching to a pole
on shoulder', does not allow for object suffixes implies that the envelopment part of the
semantics is important.
A few examples have been noted of 'carrying' verbs being used in an alternative
construction, in series with the verb -ei 'do', as in example ( 1 1 1 ) below. In this instance, the
human object suffix is omitted. The use of an accusative object-referencing pronoun, such as
die, is, however, obligatory.","[79, 80]"
"6.2 Involuntary state subjectsIn many languages of New Guinea an involuntary state is usually coded with the
experiencer as the apparent object of the construction and the stimulus as a nominal (in
contrast to reference-dominated languages like English in which the experiencer is coded as
the subject of the event). In I'saka the construction most closely resembles the New Guinea
norm, but the experiencer, while appearing in accusative case (if it is pronominal) is marked
on the verb with dative suffixes. This might reflect the fact that dative suffixes are more
productive than is strict object marking on the verb, but may also reflect the semantic role
associated with the experiencer.
The predicate 'sick', for instance, is expressed with a morphological non-subject. We can
call it a non-subject only because the morphology coding of the argument is not consistent:
based on the form of the pronoun we would think that I SG was an object, but based on the
fact that it is indexed by a dative suffix on the verb we are led to believe that it is an oblique.

"94Chapter 66. 4.2 Postpositional accompanimentSubject or object NPs may be conjoined using the postposition tro 'with' . The behaviour
of the conjunct differs depending on the syntactic role it bears. A second non-subject noun
phrase may appear as a modifier to the first object, in the preverbal object NP position, as in:
(277)Wesie sit
tro n-ou.
tulip sago with 1 SO-eat
'I ate greens and sago. 'Alternatively, the conjunct may appear as an oblique argument in the postverbal oblique
position, as in:
(278)Sit
n-ou
wesie tro.
sago 1 SO-eat tulip with
'I ate sago with greens. 'When a subject argument consisting of two nominals appears with one conjunct marked
by tro, the second noun must be coded as an oblique argument, and appear in the postverbal
oblique position, as in the following examples.
(279)Ba
dina
sit
k-oung
nana tro.
brother I so.poss sago 3S0.M-eat I so with
'My brother ate sago with me. '(280)Tani' k-ele '
moni' tro pll.
father 3S0.M-go mother with garden
'Dad went to the garden with mum. 'Notice that the verbs in these cases do not inflect for the combined dual number, but
rather only show agreement for the person, number and gender of the preverbal �rgument in
the subject NP. This suggests that the postverbal NP is in fact truly an oblique, since the
agreement does not include it, as it did with the simple adjacency conjunction type seen in
§6.4. 1 . This suggests that it is not possible for a tro-marked oblique to modify a noun in
an NP if the NP is the subject of the clause, but only if it is the object.
There is some evidence to suggest whether or not it is permissible to link two subject
nominals with tro on the same side of the verb. The unacceptability of (28 1 ) below may be
partly caused by the attempt at subject co-ordination, but in truth we would expect this
sentence to be ungrammatical in any case, as the verb is inflected for the first person subject
only.
(28 1 )*nana ba
dina
tro sit

I so

'My brother and 1 ate sago. 'Even with non-singular number agreement, the sentence is still ungrammatical:
(282)*nana ba
dina
tro sit
sing
I so
brother I so.poss with sago 1 DU:eat
'My brother and 1 ate sago.'","[111, 112]"
"5. 1.2 Accompaniment and locationThe case markers sa and tro appear on some oblique noun phrases to more closely specify
the meaning than simply general oblique, which is implied by the NP appearing in a
postverbal position. Sa is used to show accompaniment, and tro can be used with this
function, or to indicate a specifically interior location (within). The former, sa, is used only
infrequently, and not accepted by some speakers; for those that do use it, sa appears at the
start of the NP, not final. Tro is often omitted from speech, with the simple locative coding
sufficing for its sense.
Examples of these case markers can be seen in the following phrases:
(9 1 )K-ele '-le'
sa
Dominic.
3SG.M-gO-RED ACCOM Dominic
'He went with Dominic. '(92)Bala
d-ele'-le '
Pasi Robert-tro.
tomorrow 1 SG-gO-RED Pasi Robert-ACCOM
'Tomorrow I 'm going to Pasi with Robert. '56Chapter 5Note that the order of the accompanier and the goal is not fixed, as can be seen by
comparing the last sentence with the following:
(93)D-ele '-le '
Simon-tro
Awakali.
l SG-gO-RED Simon-ACCOM Vanimo
'I 'm going to go to Vanimo with Simon.'","[73, 74]"
"5.3.2 Adjunct nominalsNouns also play a prominent role in building complex and explicit predicate semantics for
clauses which use the light verb -ei 'do' as their main inflecting verb. This is done in two
main ways: either through the use of a preverbal non-inflecting nominal specifier, for
example makaing in the complex predicate makaing d-ei 'I help' ; or through knowledge of
the nature of the main participants. For an example of this latter strategy, a clause consisting
of a human subject, an animate animal object, and the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted as
'(Human) shoots/kills (animal)', based on the shared knowledge of the cultural world in
which I'saka speakers live. In a sentence with a human subject and a normally human-made
tool or artifact as the object, the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted to mean 'make, process'.",[89]
"The unmarked form is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, as it can have
a subject or dative referent, and may at times even be used as a possessive pronoun. It is
absolutely restricted only in that it may not appear as the object of a clause; this is always
reserved for the accusative pronominal set. Compare the sentence above with the following
nearly identical version using an unmarked pronoun:
( 1 93)Awakali.
Kia
k-ele '
3S0.M 3S0.M-go Vanimo
'He's gone to Vanimo.'",[96]
"5.3. 1 Dependent verbsIn addition to the independent verbs described above, there are a number of subject­
inflecting verbs that are not able to function alone in a clause without another verb.
Generally, they occur before an independent verb, agreeing with it in person, number and
gender of the shared subject. There are no recorded instances of dependent verbs taking
suffixes.
Some dependent verbs carry adverbial information, like -asu in example ( 1 57), which
indicates whether the main verb is done well or badly:
( 1 57)B-asu
b-o!
2sG-do.well 2sG-do.sG.M.OBJ
'Shoot it properly !'
(In this example 'shoot' is taken as the meaning of - 0 from the context of
the discourse, and is not related to the appearance of -asu. This sentence
is a good example of the use of light verbs without any qualifying nominal
- see §5 . 3 .2.)Some dependent verbs are used with an aspect-modifying function. Unlike the 'adverbial'
function of dependent verbs, in which they appear preceding the main predicating verb, the
dependent verb in an aspect-modifying function is positioned following the independent verb:
( 1 58)Sokaing k-ei
k-ela-pu
mi.
tobacco 3SG.M-do 3sG.M-do.habitually-? NEG
'He doesn't smoke.'
(It is likely that the final syllable pu of -elapu 'habit' is in fact the same
fossilised morpheme that is found on many other adverbs, and on the
nominative pronouns, as this syllable recurs word-final ly with notable
frequency throughout the data. The meaning of it is not known - see
§2.3 . 1 , §4. 1 and §5.5. 1 for discussion.)Morphology71Adverbial sorts of functions are also formed with adjectives, as in the following example:
( 1 59)Bal b-ei
nuo!
ball 2SG-do big
'(Come on, you) play (soccer) with some vigour ! 'In addition to this use of dependent verbs with a n independent verb to specify 'adverbial'
or 'aspectual ' functions, some dependent verbs provide the bulk of predicative semantics in a
clause through combining with and specifying the ubiquitous light verb -ei 'do', as in the
example below (in this example the suppletive verb form -ou, rather than the unmarked -ei, is
used because of the plural object) (see also the verb -imi in §5.4. 1 ).
( 1 60)n-akaing d-ou .
Kasue
cassowary 1 SG-search 1 SG-do.PL
'I 'm going to look for cassowaries. '
(Note that -akaing bears a more than chance resemblance t o the nominal
nakaing 'eye', a semantically relevant item in searching. It does, however,
regularly inflect as a verb: m-akaing b-ou 'you search for them'.)In the following example the verb -imgni 'be angry' does not occur monovalently without
the verb -ou 'do (plural object)':
(1 6 1 )Kia
k-imgni
k-ou.
3SG.M 3SG.M-angry 3SG.M-do.PL
'He's angry.'","[88, 89]"
"Syntax956.5 Clause chainingAdjacent verbs may sometimes share constituents, even when they do not form a serial
verb construction. Object noun phrases are normally obligatory in bivalent clauses, but may
be omitted if the clause immediately prior has the same object. Intonation patterns show that
these are distinct clauses, rather than serial verbs:
(283)Sit
d-ai,
n-ou.
sago l SG-get l SG-eat
'I got some sago, and ate [it]. 'I n the following sentence the oblique argument i s represented by a full independent
pronoun in the second clause, even though it is completely recoverable from the verbal
agreement:
(284)Sani
b-o
n-rlni-ma
mama.
like.that 2SG-do.M l SG-be.angry.at-2sG.DAT 2SG
'If you behave like that, I 'll be cross at you. 'The following example shows that the clause-final completive particle y a may also be
shared over two clauses. Again, we see the object noun phrase omitted in the second clause:
(285)Sit
bima
ble d-akai, n-ou
ya .
sago 2SG.POSS that l SG-cut l SG-eat COMP
'I prepared that sago of yours, and ate [it]. 'It is, of course, possible to link two monovalent clauses. The following sentence shows
two clauses with a shared oblique nominal, appearing final in the chain of verbs:
(286)Dapu
d-ele ' d-iy
wfysau pule.
l SG.NOM l SG-go l SG-sleep forest bush.camp
'I went and slept in the bush camp. 'Another option for linking clauses involves the use of the sequential marker -pa (see also
the texts in Chapter 7). This can be seen in the following textual extracts:
(28 7)D-ele ' asong-pa
nil,
tau d-ei
mi.
l SG-go stealthy-SEQ INTENSE noise l SG-do NEG
'I went along very stealthily, I didn't make any noise.'","[112, 113]"
"3.4 AdjectivesAs mentioned above, adjectives display some of the characteristics of both nouns and
verbs, but remain distinct from them morphosyntactically. A significant proportion of
adjectival roots appear to be morphologically complex, bearing a (historical?) suffix -pa that
is not observed on either nouns or verbs. The meaning of this morpheme is synchronically
opaque, and it appears to be a fossilised affix of some sort. Some examples include ino-pa
'far away', amo-pa 'many', asong-pa 'stealthy' and kai-pa 'one'; the putative roots of these
words, ino, a m o , a so and kai, are never found without the putative suffix -pa , so the
meaning of this putative suffix cannot be determined. The distantly related Skou language
(see § 1 .2, Figure 3) similarly has a disproportionate number of adjectives ending in the
inseparable putative suffix -fa : kukufa 'quick', hahafa 'slow', etc. This would be a likely
cognate with the I'saka -pa formative, suggesting that any productivity lies for the most part
in the distant past of the languages.
Morphologically, adjectives (and no other word classes) may occur with a postposed
intensifying particle ni', as is shown in the examples below.",[59]

neighbouring Skou languages, it is a very distant one, in terms of structural diversity roughly
on the order of the differences and similarities that can found between Russian and English.
(Examples of some of the cognates that have led to the establishment of I'saka's position
within the Macro-Skou family can be found in §9.) The people in Krisa have an oral
tradition of having previously lived along a string of ridges that run south of their current
plateau home down to the Pual river valley, and before that further to the west in the valley
itself. It is likely that this tradition of previous occupancies accurately represents the history
of the Krisa people as they were forced into the more marginal hill areas when the Mbo and
Ningera people advanced down the Pual valley, displacing both the ancestors of the Krisa
people and the ancestors of the speakers of Skou-Serra-Piore linkage language (Donohue &
Crowther 2000; see also Donohue 2002a).","[24, 25, 26]"
"The glides Iwl and Iji are permitted in coda position on monosyllables or word-finally (that
is, they may appear only at the right edge of a word). This means that an alternative
formulation of the permitted syllable structures for words in I'saka is that shown in Figure 8,
in which the word-final glide is structurally not part of a particular syllable but is an
extrametrical segment in the word.

phonetic manifestation other than serving as a buffer to intervocalic lenition. The analysis of
the reduplication of dei 'I do' is shown in (39). Here we can see that reduplication applies toPhonology31the whole phonetic syllable, which can be of the allowed shape CVG (see Table 1 4). In the
reduplicated form, however, there is no position for the now medial glide to be realised; it
blocks intervocalic lenition, but is not structurally permitted at anything other than a word­
final position, and so is not realised on the word.

EJThe reduplication of a two syllable root follows the same pattern, with the entire first
phonetic syllable reduplicated (as seen in §2.4.2). The fact that it is impossible for a glide to
be specified on the first syllable of a two (or more) -syllable word means that there is never a
conflict about the reduplication template, though interestingly this template applies to
phonetic syllables, including extrametrical material, and not to the underlyingly specified
syllable.
Note that when a complex verb collocation is irrealis, it is only the second element that
undergoes reduplication. In (40) we can see that of the two-verb collocation -ana -ung (see
§5. 3 . 3) only the second verb is reduplicated:

of a final [s] . The following examples are representative of such words (some additional
examples may be gathered from 1 0.2):
(4 1 )0::>1]
'fence'[bab::>l]
'sago grub'[k::>p]
'fence'[suzup]
'grass'[waws]
'prawn'It is likely that these above examples are loan words: traditional farming methods amongst
the people of Krisa village do not employ fences, and so these terms are suitable candidates
for borrowing from a neighbouring language, such as Mbo, a Border language spoken in
nearby Osol, a village that has moved up from the Pual basin and, along with its fenced
gardens, is only a few hours walk away from Krisa. Kocher-Schmid ( 1 999) notes that plant
names are shared extensively throughout the Kilimeri cultural area, regardless of the
relatedness or unrelatedness of the languages in question, and so the chance of these terms
being originally loans from another language, perhaps brought in as alternants or as the
names of new varieties of the plant, and then generalised, is high. Unfortunately there is
little to no linguistic information available about these interior languages, so this cannot be
tested in detail.
It is not entirely clear whether phonologically underlying glides (that is, segmental
phonemes) are permitted as word-medial syllable onsets, or whether their occurrence in this
position is a result of intervocalic epenthesis. For example, with a form such as [duw£] 'dog',
is the underlying form Idu£l, with an epenthetic glide, or Iduw£1? It is noticeable that some
intervocalic occurrences of the glide [w] consistently sound more like an onset than others.
For example, the glide in [duw£] 'dog' sounds more like a 'full' consonant than that of
[kasuW£] 'cassowary': it is perceptibly longer, is less likely to elide in fast speech, and more
likely to involve slight friction (though this is rare).","[48, 49, 50]"
"3Word classesA discussion of the morphology and morpho syntax of I'saka, or any other language, must
be based on the knowledge of the different categories that make up the units to which
morphological or syntactic restrictions apply. In this section we shall detail the different
lexical categories that must be recognised in a description of I'saka, and present the
morphological and syntactic arguments for their differentiation. There are three open word
classes, and a number of closed lexical classes. After an overview, the major word classes
are described in the following sections, followed by a brief overview of the minor word
classes, including references to where a more detailed description of their properties has been
provided. The major closed word class, pronouns, receives further treatment in a unified
account with the bound pronominals in Chapter 4.","[55, 56]"

verbs (for further details, see §5.2.3). The only other productive agreement marking on verbs

relationships and are extremely frequent. The different types of morphology are described in
the sections that follow.","[75, 76]"

We can thus conclude that the ability of an adjective to appear in a postverbal position is
dependent on the nominal that it refers to being the S or the P of the clause, that is, an
absolutive argument. This can be shown to be the case by examining the following clauses,
using the quantifier purupa 'all, complete' in a postverbal position. The first sentence has a
singular subject, so the interpretation of the quantifier as modifying the P is not surprising. In
the second clause, daka u is the only argument of the monovalent clause, and so the
interpretation is not in question.

"The productivity of this construction with loan words, and the non-compositional nature
of the semantics of the resulting complex verb, implies that it is a highly salient construction
in need of more investigation. It should not be thought that the number of Tok Pisin
borrowings in these constructions indicates that the language has a deficient or less rich
system of expression, or that it is currently undergoing massive relexification and/or
language shift. In addition to sentences like A d-o pig 1 SG-do, meaning 'I shot a pig', people
in Krisa also say A sutim d-o, with Tok Pisin sutim 'shoot' incorporated into the structure as
a semantically specific adjunct nominal. Even though there is a (clearly recent) explicit
coding strategy for 'shooting', the non-adjunct nominal construction with nothing more than
the light verb 'do' is also perfectly acceptable and normal, albeit (from a European linguistic
perspective) highly underspecified semantically. The cultural context (what do people do to
pigs?), given the discourse in which it occurs (what do people do to pigs, in the bush, when
they've taken their dog and bow and a handful of arrows?), make the various, linguistically
ambiguous, uses of the light verb perfectly communicative for I'saka speakers. A similar
strategy has been noted in populous Dravidian languages such as Tamil, using English words
as adjuncts to the light verb 'do', alongside native lexemes, with no evidence of language
shift or even necessarily diglossia operating.",[91]
"Note that this is an example in which the adjective (nuo 'big') appears adjacent to the noun
rather than after the verb, despite the fact that no peripheral argument is present. This may be
because of the presence of the completive particle, or because subject-linked adjectives
cannot follow serialised verbs. However, from (293) we can see that an object-linked
adjective may follow this sort of complex predicate. Note that in this sentence there is no
completive particle.

"6Chapter 1Anthropological interest has also focused on a 'millennia I ideology' that apparently
flourished in Krisa (as elsewhere in the world) as the year 2000 approached (see Kocher
Schmid & Klappa 1 999, and Klappa 1 999c). The relationship between these researchers and
the village is ongoing. Although the current material is focussed on linguistic data and not
anthropological theory, in the minds of the Krisa people it represents just the latest in a long
line of note-taking on essentially the same topic. In our experience it is usual that, in northern
New Guinea, any anthropological or linguistic work with a people group is usually described
by the subjects of that research as involving a researcher coming to 'learn the local language',
and any approved of and successful researcher will be described as having 'learnt the local
language well' .2 Clearly, language consciousness is the measure of cultural worth in this part
of the world.","[23, 24]"
"5.2. 4 Argument inflection using the dative suffixA range of non subcategorised participants are marked on the verb using the dative suffix.
The fact that the nominal is peripheral can be judged by its appearance in a postverbal
position, a position reserved for oblique arguments. 3 Although there is a large range of
possible referents, with different and non-conflicting semantic roles, only one instance of the
dative suffix may appear in any one clause; the criteria for choosing which of the possible
referents of the dative suffix will be chosen in the event of two or more possible candidates
are not yet known, though it does seem that, while semantically not incompatible, it is
unlikely from a discourse point of view that two of the possible candidates for coding will
appear in the one clause.
This suffix demands an animate referent, and can be used to encode recipient,
beneficiary, goal, experiencer and possessor (usually the possessor of the object of a bivalent
verb). The forms of the dative suffix are shown in Table 28, and some examples of its use
are reproduced below. Some forms are identical to the human object suffixes shown in
Table 27.

followed by a discussion of some optional appearances of the suffixes. Here we can see the
use of the dative suffix with recipient, beneficiary, goal, experiencer and possessor referents.
In all cases, if there is a nominal referring to the same argument that is coded on the verb
with the dative suffixes it must appear postverbally.
3An argument for treating postverbal nominals as truly oblique, and not simply obliquely coded core
arguments (such as the datives of many European languages) is presented in §6. 1 .2.",[81]
"The following example shows that the theme object of the verb may head the relative
clause even when a dative argument is explicitly present on the verb:

'The bag I gave him wasn't big. '
(this sentence, with a different intonation, is also grammatical with the
reading 'I didn't give him a big bag.')In this example the adjective nuo is licensed to appear following the relative clause
because it is not part of the NP headed by pa , but rather is the predicate of the clause.",[116]
"1IntroductionI'saka is the language spoken in the village of Krisa. It is also spoken in the off-shoot
settlement at Pasi, four hours' walk north near the coast and c loser to government
administration, and also at numerous temporary bush camps about the plateau lands near
Mount Asowa, which is the centre of the range of hunting and gathering for the people of
Krisa village. The language is endangered in all senses of the word, inconsistently used in
this one village, and sparsely used outside it. Close by in the larger population centre of
Vanimo, different languages are spoken. Tok Pisin, the lingua franca of most of Papua
New Guinea, has supplanted most of the traditional functions of I'saka. Nonetheless, I'saka
still serves as an icon of the separateness and identity of the Krisa people (§ 1 .3 .2), and is still
being passed on.
This is the first linguistic documentation of the I1saka language. Laycock ( 1 973)
tentatively classifies that language, which he calls Krisa , along with Rawo, Puari and
Warap u (now known as Puare and Barupu), as members of the Krisa branch of the
Sko phylum. In the light of more recent research this classification is not tenable: although
the languages are all related to each other, as well as to the closely related languages of the
coastal strip from Pasi to the Skou villages across the border into Papua, it is in a very
different configuration to that proposed by Laycock (the classification that is followed here
is described in § 1 . 3). Since the publication of Laycock ( 1 973), there have been occasional
references in print to the position of I'saka within his classification, but no material on or
references to the language have appeared, other than Donohue and San Roque (2000), and
San Roque (200 1 ).
The language of the people who live in Krisa village is more properly known as I'saka,
the name preferred by native speakers, and also a name that is phonotactically possible in the
language (see §2.6 . 1 ). In this work both terms will be used, but for different senses: the
language shall be referred to as I'saka, and the people and their village as Krisa.
I'saka is unusual not only in terms of general world typology, but also in terms of the
characteristics we might expect from a language of New Guinea, indeed even of the Macro­
Skou family in which it finds its nearest cousins. Using the characteristics of a 'typical'
Papuan language that Foley ( 1 998) proposes, we find that I'saka can be accommodated into
the phonological expectations for Papuan languages, but that is only because the prospect of
complete allophony between voiced stops and voiced nasals was not considered by Foley (see
§2.4. 1 for discussion). Asmat (Voorhoeve 1 9 65) also shows complementary and free
distribution between oral stops and nasal stops; Clouse and Clouse ( 1 993) describe just such a
situation in languages of the Lakes Plains of West Papua. The latter languages are much

"2. 4.2 Other allophones of /d/The voiced dento-alveolar stop Idl exhibits the most diverse allophony of the I 'saka
consonants. Nasalisation of Id/ has been described above, and the remaining rules are shown
below.
(22)+ voice
+ alveolar---4+ lateral
+ sonorantI V_V
I C -alveolar
- sonorantThis rule states that the phoneme Idl is realised as a lateral [1] in two environments: either
intervocalically, or following a non-dento-alveolar consonant. We can restate the rule above
in the following pair of phonetically descriptive rules:
(23)Id/---4[1] I V_V(24)Id/---4[1] I C[/p/, fbi, Is/] _Examples of this rule in operation are the following:
(25)Isudul---4[sulu]
'where'Ipdajl---4[p1cB]
'bad'The phones [d] and [1] are in complementary distribution, [d] being largely restricted to
word-initial position (although see Table 1 6), in which [1] never appears. An interesting aside
on this matter is the fact that I'saka speakers, when referring to one of the investigators,
would rarely use her English name, Lila ['lajla], but instead decided that it must be [da'laj] or
[di'laj], and referred to her with this, spelling it, on occasion, as Delai (see also §2. 5 .3 on
Glide deletion). One older speaker has been heard producing Uu dukfpinis] for Tok Pisin Yu
lukim pinis? 'Have you seen it?', when speaking in that language.
Alternations between the two allophones can be observed through morphological changes
brought about by reduplication (which marks irrealis mood). This morpheme specifies that
the first syllable of the verb is reduplicated, following the addition of any subject agreement
inflection (see the discussion of syllable and word structure in §2.6). (Some speakers, somePhonology25of the time, apply this rule before the subject prefix has been added, for some inflections.
Thus in addition to kekelei [kEYElej] 'he will see', we have also sometimes heard [kEIElej],
showing reduplication of the first CV sequence in the verb root) . Two examples are shown
below in Table 1 2. In the first row we see the verb IEdEj/ 'see' inflected for 3S0.M subject
with the prefix Ik-I. Note how in the irrealis inflection, the Ikl and its following vowel is
reduplicated, with the velar stop being further lenited intervocalically, to be realised as the
voiced fricative [Y] . Similarly, in the second example, the reduplicated Idl is realised
intervocalically as [1].

'I 'll see'The voiced alveolar stop Idl is realised as the alveolar rhotic [r] (or flap [.u) following the
alveolar consonant It/, and when in an intervocalic environment that crosses a morpheme
boundary (at a lower level than the word boundary) (there are no instances in our data of the
sequence Iddy/, so we cannot assume that [dry] is possible).
(26)+ voice � + sonorant

that occurrence of [r] is extremely restricted. All intervocalic occurrences of [r] lie on
morpheme boundaries and otherwise it is only found after the voiceless alveolar stop [t]. It is
possible, however, that this is no longer a productive phonological rule and that occurrence of
[r] has become 'fossilised' to some extent, so that the sound change is diachronic rather than
synchronic.","[42, 43]"
"3.5.3 PronounsThe language distinguishes three numbers in its pronouns, as well as contrastive gender in
the third person singular (but nowhere else). Uniquely in the language, the pronouns are
marked for different cases, contrasting nominative, accusative, and possessive pronouns, as
well as an unmarked set of underspecified pronouns, and various bound forms that appear on
nouns, adjectives and verbs.
Because of the complexities involved in the description of pronouns, concerning not just
morphology but also restrictions and requirements to do with their syntactic environments,
they are not described here, but in the next chapter.",[61]

(Note here also the use of second person singular prefixes, consistent with
a command, despite the vocative use of a [necessarily third person]
nominal sentence-initially.)It is not known what motivates a speaker's choice of one of these constructions over the
other. An alternative mode of inflection for object is found productively with verbs that take
an adjunct nominal, and use the dative suffixes to mark the affected experiential object.
The second class of bivalent verbs, the vast majority of verbs in the lexicon, normally
shows no marking for object.","[80, 81]"
"Object suffixes (and presumably dative suffixes) need only be marked on the second verb,
as is shown in the verb series -esi 'carry' + -epa 'put' ('hold') in example ( 1 1 0), though this
may be a result of the first verb not being eligible to take the highly restricted object marking
(recall that only a small minority of verbs inflect for (non-dative) object in I'saka).
Restrictions on the compulsory sharing of irrealis inflection for serial verbs (that is, whether
one or both must be inflected) are not known.",[114]

would want to group Serra Hills and Piore River together, against a Skou group, and I'saka as
an isolate, as shown in Figure 1 0.

the tree presented in Figure 3 has shown these two groups, along with the Skou group, as
sisters. On the other hand the phonological changes do suggest that I'saka forms a first-order
subgroup within the family.","[125, 126]"

object of a bivalent verb. The following sentences show examples of the use of the

"1.3.3 Previous work on the languageThe I'saka language has been referred to in the linguistic and anthropological literature as
'Krisa', following the name of the village. Reference to the language in print is limited; only
Laycock ( 1 973, 1 97 5 ) mentions the language, where it is reported to have 347 speakers.
The only previous linguistic work on I'saka is found in Laycock's 1 970 notes on 'Krisa'
and other languages of the East and West Sepik districts. While none of the linguistic data
from Krisa were ever to be published, the materials in his notebooks show that he was
definitely dealing with the same language as the one described here. Lexically there is no
difference between the speech variety that he has recorded and the one described here. He
noted ( 1 970:340) that the language was tonal, with pitch contours occasionally noted, and
four different patterns differentiated, roughly [-], [-], [I], and [\], probably reflecting the
same four tones that we have heard, low, high, rising and falling. (Curiously though, he later
(197 5 :8 5 1) wrote that 'Krisa and Rawo may have two tones only'. Rawo actually has five
contrastive tones.) (See §2.2. 1 for the tonology of I'saka.) In most cases where we have
found nasalisation, Laycock too has transcribed nasalisation on vowels, though occasionally
he shows more nasalisation than we have attested, with prenasalisation on following stops
that we have only rarely heard. An example of this is his sentence <nana ndau dey> 'Mi kam
slip' for our Nana d-au d-iy /da:da: d-aw d-ijl, [nana daw dgj] 'I'm coming to sleep. ' His data
shows the same set of verbal inflections (though he did not spot the allomorphy between the
oral and nasal stops). Laycock ( 1 97 5 :38 8) lists the verb inflections as being those shown
below in ( 1 ); these are completely compatible with the inflections that we shall see , discussed
in § 5 .2.2 and §8, and shown here as (1 )'.
(1 )nm-kw-sisasa-diyia-( 1 )'dbkw-/t-s(i)ss-diyie/0The intervocalic allophone of /d/, which we have heard as [1] is listed as both <1> and <r>
in Laycock 's notes. The alternation between [£] and [a] that we have observed in some
pronouns is evidenced in free nouns as well in Laycock's notes, where we can find <duwa>
for our duwe 'dog', and <siya?> for our sie 'two', and also in the 3PL inflection on verbs, as
can be seen in ( 1 ) above. The intervocalic allophone of /k/ that we transcribe as [V£V] ,
[£V : ] or [V: ] (see §2.3.3) i s described by Laycock a s a 'yelaric click [sic ]; glottalised?;
implosive?', showing his trouble with the sound and its phonetic characterisation. In hisIntroduction11notebooks it is often transcribed with the IPA symbol for creak, a tilde below the segment
with creak, combined with a velar stop, thus Os] , as in the following examples: <s:lk:JY>
'tobacco/', <ib]sei> 'eye' . At variance with our materials, Laycock even records what is
presumably this allophone word-initially in <]sow> 'cloud', though from our data this would
be expected only if the token occured phrase-medially.
With the differences noted above, Laycock 's materials are compatible with the analysis
that we present here, although there is not as much detail.","[28, 29]"
