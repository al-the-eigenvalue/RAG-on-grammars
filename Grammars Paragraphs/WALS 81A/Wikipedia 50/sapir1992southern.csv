190SAPIRIndependent and enclitic pronouns are often combined into a single
phonetic group or 'Svord,"" the independent or enclitic element being
either subjective or objective. Thus, instead of saying i'mi pAxqa'yumpa n ia r/A t h o u k i l l - w i l l - h i m , one can attach objective -αηΛ
to imi-: ϊτηί'αηΛ pA'qa'yumpani'
t h o u - h i m k i l l - w i l l . The following types of combination occur:
(a) Independent subject + enclitic object, e. g.:
rii""'imi pA'qa'yumpa n-i I-thee kill-shall
ni'rjuml mQi'mpa yumi I-you (plur.) lead-will-you

(inv.) see-negative-past, he did not see it
mam 'i'ntcaq-A NA'n'vi""'iaq-A they (vis.)-preterit-it (vis.) forget-it
(vis.), they forgot it
A variant of this type is that in which the independent and enclitic
pronouns are both subjective, the independent pronoun being used
predicatively, e. g.:
imi'ntcu'a q-A ni'niA p'iywa'ntuywaq ainan iani thou-interrogative-it
(vis.) me ( = my) whom-depending-on-perfective-verbal nounlike-my, it is not you on whom I have been depending (for use of
"" i t "" as equivalent of substantive verb, see § 56, 3)
(b) Independent object (possessive) +enclitic subject, e. g.:ηϊ'ηϊα' pn)wa'niv""a n-iani me-thou wife-make-will-me, you will marry

A special variety of this type is that in which the independent
objective functions as the subject of a subordinate clause, the enclitic
subject as the subject of the main clause, e. g.:
rii'niantca ijA tTqa'xuni yaya'x-A me-preterit-he eat-while-me cry
(momentaneously); while I was eating, he began to cry (-ntca'ijA is

would (the) earth appear? (im/ia- anticipates

(c) Independent object + enclitic object. The first object may be
the subject of a subordinate clause, the second its object, e. g.:

Or, conversely, the first object may be the logical object, the second
the logical subject of the subordinate clause, e. g.:

192SAPIR§ 41. Combinations of enclitic pronouns.
Enclitic pronouns are often combined, the union of two such pronouns being extremely common, that of three not at all rare. The
order of elements is rigidly determined by form, not by function (e. g.
-atjani- HE-ME, I-HIM, I-HIS, HIS-ME, MY-HIM, HE-MY). The resulting
theoretical ambiguities are generally resolved by the context, particularly as the pleonastic usages already referred to (§ 40, 5) give
opportunity for further limitation of the syntactical possibilities.
Thus, rii' -ayanl can only mean I-HIM or I-HIS; -aijani -ni (verb form)
can hardly mean anything but HE-ME. The following table gives a
survey of combinations of two enclitic pronouns; the horizontal entries
are subjective, the vertical objective. As a rule the pronominal elements are preserved intact, but certain modifications need to be
noted.
The combined forms listed in the table apply not only to combinations of subject and object of the same verb but to all other combinations of subjective and objective, including possessive, forms. The
table also includes combinations of objective + objective enclitics,
insofar as objective forms are identical with subjective forms; e. g.
-ιaija'ami- HE-THEE, HE-THY applies also to HIM-THEE, HIM-THY, HISTHEE. Special double objective forms are:
-'mini- thee-me, me-thee
-Tjumini- you (obj.)-me, me-you (obj.)
-miriimu'i- thee-us (also us-thee, we-thee)
-rjuminimwi- you (obj.)-us (also us-you, we-you)
(1) MORPHOLOGY OF COMBINED FORMS. The following rules are
followed in the combination of enclitic pronouns:
(a) The combination of the first person singular subject and the
second person object, which should theoretically result in -miniand -Tjumini-, is simplified to - mi- and -tjumi- (properly THEE and
YOU OBJ.), the first person being thus merely implied.
(b) The second person singular subjective element (-') always
follows an element of the first or third person, also the objective form
of the second person.
(c) In all combinations of the first and second persons but those
coming under (b), the second personal element precedes (e. g. -rjw'iniYE-ME, -miniTHEE-ME).
(d) In combinations of the third person with either the first or
second person, the element referring to the third person precedes.

The following sketch of Southern Paiute, which was completed in
December, 1917, is offered as a contribution to the scientific study of
the Shoshonean languages. Whether or not it proves to be fairly
typical of the whole group in phonologic and morphologic respects
must be left to future research.
My first field acquaintance with Shoshonean linguistics was gained
in a short trip during August and September of 1909 among the
Northern Utes of Uintah Reserve, Utah. This trip was undertaken,
with the collaboration of Dr. J. A. Mason, under the auspices of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. A number of Ute texts
were secured, supplemented by considerable grammatical information.
To extend and deepen the insight into Plateau Shoshonean linguistics
then obtained it seemed advisable, indeed necessary, to undertake
further researches. Hence arrangements were made by the late
Dr. G. B. Gordon, Director of the Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania, with the authorities of the Indian school at Carlisle
to have one of their Paiute students, Tony Tillohash, put a t my
disposal for the ethnologic and linguistic study of his tribe. I worked
with Tony, who proved to be an excellent informant, in Philadelphia
from February to May of 1910. A series of texts, much supplementary grammatical material, a large number of songs, and considerable ethnological information were obtained. The Paiute
linguistic data proved so much superior to the Ute which I had
previously secured that I have decided in this sketch to limit myself
to the former. Moreover, there is enough phonetic, lexical, and
morphologic difference between Ute and Southern Paiute to render
the attempt to describe both at the same time confusing. I hope to
publish a briefer sketch of the Ute language at some future date.
The present volume is to be followed by a series of Southern Paiute
and Ute texts and by a Southern Paiute vocabulary. I t is a great
pleasure to recall the unflagging patience and helpfulness of Tony
Tillohash and the kindness with which Dr. Gordon did all that lay
in his power to make these studies possible. My thanks are due Miss
Jane McHugh, the Secretary and at that time Acting Director of the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and the authorities of the
Museum for permission to have these Paiute studies published by theX Southern Paiute and Ute
4PREFACEAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. To Professor Franz Boas I
owe a special debt of gratitude for arranging with the Bureau of American Ethnology that I prepare the present paper, later transferred to
the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, and for his more
recent efforts in enlisting the interest of the Academy in the publication of my Southern Paiute manuscripts.

-kvp-'i- is frequently used as a base in optative forms with enclitic

A past participial irrealis, -kvpiyanii-, is also found, e. g.: pAxqq/urjqυυ""p'iyanfini who would have killed me

but, so far as known, the dubitative suffix is not employed with other
tense suffixes. Examples of -vi -, -mp'i·- are:

§ 34. Order of verbal elements.
At this point we may conveniently take up the question of the
order in which occur the various elements that build up a verb form.
Four main positions are to be recognized: prefix, verbal theme,
suffix (prevailingly formal in character), and enclitic. Each of these
positions may consist of more than one element. On the otherX Southern Paiute and Ute
170SAPIEhand, only the second position is necessarily filled, though ordinarily
one or more elements of the third position follow. The order of
elements within each of the four fundamental positions is, for the
most part, rigorously determined. Fifteen positions may be recognized within the third, though, needless to say, only a limited number
of combinations among these are intrinsically possible. The following
scheme will be useful for reference (the letters and numbers indicate
order of position):
A. Prefix
1. Adverbial prefix (§ 20)
2. Reflexive prefix (§ 22)
3. Instrumental prefix (§ 21)
B. Verbal theme
1. (a) Verb stem (or other stem if followed by Β 2); or (b) combination of stems, last of which is necessarily verbal (unless Β 2
follows) (§ 18, 2)>
2. Verbalizing suffix (§ 26)
C. Suffix
1. Suffixes of voice and aspect: -ya- (§ 30, 1); -yi- (§ 30, 2);
-qi- (§ 30,3); -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c); -wo- (§ 31, 2, b); -tea- (§ 31, 2, d)
2. -tcai- (§ 31, 2, a)
3. Causative -f-ui- (§ 29, 12)
4. Indirective (or transitivizing) -rjqi- (§ 29, 11)
5. Pluralizing suffixes: -qa- (§ 31, 1, c); -'ψνα- (§ 31, 1, a); -t-'i(§31, 1, b)
6. Suffixes of movement (§ 28); continuative -n'ni- (§ 30, 12)
7. Momentaneous suffixes: -iju- (§ 30, 5); -qu- (§ 30, 7)
8. Resultative -qai- (§ 30, 9); passive -t'i- (§ 29, 13)
9. Perfective -q ai- (§ 32, 3); usitative -mia-, -mi-n (§ 30, 10);
-ml- (§ 30, 13). -m i-"" precedes -q ai-.
10. Future -pa - (§ 32, 4), -pan-ia (§ 32, 5; -n-ia- probably best
considered as belonging to position 14)

A 2 (or A 3) + Β 1 (a) + Β 2 may, however, be taken as unit and compounded with preceding (non-verbal) or following (verbal) stem.
Indeed,
this extended verbal "" t h e m e "" m a y also include elements (chiefly 1 - 4 ) belonging to position C. It is difficult to give rules, as composition takes place
whenever two or more elements or groups of elements are felt as logically
combinable or psychologically equivalent. Composition thus s o m e w h a t
breaks in on our order scheme.","[186, 187, 188]"

"Paiute recognizes two fundamental syntactical cases, the subjective and objective. The former of these is in use as the subject
of a non-subordinate verb; the object of an imperative (see § 52); and
as a base for the affixing of postpositions (see § 50). The objective is
the case of the object of a transitive verb; the subject of a subordinate
verb (see §55, 1); the genitive (possessive); and the apposition to
a noun with postposition (see §50, 3).
( 1 ) FORMATION OF SYNTACTICAL CASES. The subjective case is
simply the absolutive, the unmodified noun with no specific caseX Southern Paiute and Ute
216SAPIRsuffix. The objective is formed by suffixing -a- to the final vowel
of the noun, if this vowel is i, I, a, or u (o); -ya- (-ία-) if the final
vowel is a. Examples are:

qanini my house

qani'ani
qani'aijA
quna'via'ami
paa'tA

nampa'ia-ηΑAnother objective suffix, -q u-, -yqu-, is used after numeral stems
(see § 59, 2, a) and after certain postpositions (e. g. -ma-, -ψοα- ON;
-rjwa'ai- TOGETHER WITH; -mpa-AT; -upa- THROUGH; see § 5 0 , 4 ) ;
cf. also adverbial ü ijqu- (§ 30, 2, b).
(2) U S E OF SYNTACTICAL CASES. The subjective as a subject and
the objective as a transitive object are so plentifully illustrated in
the course of this paper that no further examples need be given here.
The other uses of the subjective will be illustrated below (§ 52; §
50), also the use of the object as the subject of a subordinate verb
(§55, 1).
The genitive function of the objective is seen, e. g., in:
ftv^i'pT qiip»a 'ava'LnfC land (obj.) edge-at-participle (obj.), being
(obj.) at (the) edge of (the) land
•Hwa'ri' tu(w)a'tsii)wi rain (obj.) children, Rain's children
Often with pleonastic use of a pronominal enclitic, e. g.:
cina'ywavL %ntu' q-urjWA coyote (obj.) back-flesh-his (inv.), Coyote's
back flesh
qam""aijw u'u'rn paa'(i)ya<t>i (he went) house-obj.-her it-toward
aunt-obj.-own, (he went) toward his aunt's house
While the subjective form is used as a base for the suffixing of a
postposition, the form is felt as the equivalent of an objective, as
appositions to such nouns or pronouns are regularly put in the objective, e. g. wantsi αϊ] αψι'ητα ANTELOPE (OBJ.) HE (VIS.; = HIM) HE-Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language
SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE217Such periphrastic forms are extremely common (see § 50, 3).
The sporadic subjective use of objective forms of independent
personal pronouns in certain not clearly understood cases has been
already mentioned (§ 39, 4, end).

"(2) A B S O L U T E V E R B FORMS. A S has been abundantly illustrated,
verb forms, even aside from nominal derivatives (§ 25, 1-6), often
appear without either enclitic or suffixed tense elements. Such
forms may be conveniently termed absolutes. They are used under
various circumstances:
(a) When tense (and pronominal) elements arc appended to another preceding word in the sentence, the verb appears as an absolute,
e. g.:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE235a'itcayani qu'qwi then-preterit-him (vis.)-I shoot, then I shot him;
contrast qu'qwi'tea-yaw
I shot him
(b) In imperative forms (see § 52).
(c) Frequently in interrogative forms, where reference is had to
present time.
(d) Generally substantive verbs (aro'a-, uru'a-, § 56) have no
present suffix, present (or general) time being implied when there is
no tense suffix.
(e) Verbs of BEING and HAVING in -Icai- (§ 26, 1, a and b) take no -xjitoexpress present time, but are tenseless, e. g. qant!%aini I HAVE A
HOUSE.
It is probable that in such cases -Icai- represents an old
contraction of -kai-y'i-, as the -y'i- reappears after an intervening
impersonal 4-ua- (see § 29, 14; § 32, 8).
§ 52. The imperative.
The imperative is only negatively determined as regards form, i. e.
by the absence of tense elements, further by the frequent absence of
the second person singular in forms that have a pronominal or nominal
object. Syntactically, imperatives are remarkable in that they
take an object in the subjective form. The pronominal subject or
object, as usual, may be appended either to the verb or to a preceding
element, e. g. hortatory iVi'- (§ 60, 2, d). Examples illustrative of
these remarks are:
ivi""i drink-thou! drink!
avi'mituywa'""
it-out of-thou! go out!
iVi'"" ivi'yu hortatory-thou drink-momentaneous! go ahead, take a
drink!
qatcu"" wa'a'i]i{y)a'p-.\ not-thou shout-negative! don't shout!
OVL m-αχιιηι stiek-give-me! give me a stick!

p.i'qa'yuayA sari'Hv aijA kill-hiin (vis.) dog (subjective) he (vis.)!

qwiri'k-ltsiaq• i'tci tVqa 'q-A arise-gerund (§ 55, 1, a)-it (vis.) this
(inan. subjective) eat-it (vis.)! after getting up, eat this!
vvwa'nfini
ya'yqihi
it (inv.)-at-being (subjective)-me carry-forhither! bring me (it) over there!
Imperatives with a dual or plural subject do not seem to occur with
enclitic pronominal subject, but arc characterized instead by anX Southern Paiute and Ute
236SAPIRenclitic -ya-, appended either to the verb form or a preceding word.
In plural imperative forms the verb is plural in form; dual imperatives,
particularly if intransitive, frequently add dual pronominal enclitic
. . .ml- to -ya-: -y'am'i-. Examples of plural and dual imperatives,
with and without pronominal objects, are:
ti''qa'q a(i)rA,tVqa'qai*e a t ye!qatcu'i' minta'n'ia'p-A not-plur. imper. run (plur. verb-stem)- negative! do not run away (plur.)!

i(y)e'nuq(w)a(i)ya q-A this-at (§ 50, 4, l)-plur. subject-plur. imper.it (vis.)! here it is! (speaking to more than two; note idiomatic
use of imperative)

qatcu'ya-m'i yaywi""(y)ap-A
not-plur. imper.-them (vis.) carry (sing.
verb-stem)-negative! do ye 2 not carry them 2!
What is probably an emphatic imperative is sometimes formed by
appending enclitic -aqa- to the verb or a preceding word. In all
probability this -aq a- is merely an idiomatic use of enclitic pronominal
-aq a- IT (VIS.); it has the position of a pronominal enclitic. T h a t it
is not to be merely construed as a pronominal object, properly speaking,
is shown by its use with inherently intransitive as well as transitive
verbs. On the other hand, it does not seem to occur where the verb
has a true pronominal object. Examples of imperative -aqa- are:
qa-'aq-Asing!t.iy;)'q wi{y)aq·A
toyo'q wiya q-Ago ahead and r u n !

I-at-plur. imper.-it (vis.) assemble! do ye
come together at my place!
§ 53. Internal stem changes.
Verbal stem changes in Paiute that are of morphological significance may be classified under the heads of reduplication (see § 58,3-6),
vocalic modification, and consonantal affection. Only the two latter
are discussed at this point.
(1) VOCALIC ALTERNATIONS. Vocalic alternations are either quantitative or qualitative, the former, insofar as they are of morphologicalSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageS O U T H E R N P A I U T E , A S H O S H O N E A N LANGUAGE237significance, being relatively infrequent. In all, six types of vocalic
alternation may be recognized.
(a) Vocalic lengthening. A short vowel may be lengthened, a long
one over-lengthened (e. g. a· to a-a), to indicate the idea of I N V A I N ,
TO NO EFFECT, e .g.:qa'aplya'
sang to no effect ( < qa - to sing)
'a'aip'iya'
said without effect ( < ai- to say)
α'τηραχαΐ
talks to no purpose ( < ατηρα'χαϊ talks)
'o 'n'niy'uq WA did it (inv.) in vain ( < un Crfitq-WA did it)
These examples indicate that it is regularly the first vowel of the
word which is lengthened.
Another group of cases of vocalic lengthening seems to be associated
with the idea of continuation. Examples are not very numerous:
pini rjw'in-q n uq WLXw'aim'arjWA look-stand about (-yw'ino- < -Tjwln-'Lto stand, assimilated by following -n vq tt>t-)-run-go-future-him
(inv.), shall go to stand around looking for him
Uni ' ^ u ' u m i do ( < t{m-)-subordinating-them (inv.), while they 2
were so doing
po'to'qwato be spherical: pSts'i]'i'kai- to be spherical
tsi 'tsnjwayaip iyain C it seemed that (arrows) were stuck in in
several places (lengthened from normal reduplicated tsit si- >

Perhaps ma'ni-campaBARELY is similarly lengthened from

uvwa""axl
ma-^ni'campA
ya'aqwipiya'
entered, barely escaped by going over itit(inv.)-overbarely(b) Vocalic alternation to indicate number (and voice). In certain
verbs, the final vowel is a, a·, o, or u in the intransitive singular, i in
the intransitive plural and in the transitive. Examples are:
topa-qi(tree, feather, tooth)

qap a-q-i- to stop (intr.)

qovi-tcai- several break (intr.);
qopi-n'nato break one;
qovi-tca- to break several
wiyum'mi- (Ute), also winom'mito jerk up one's buttocks (continuously)(c) Vocalic alternation to indicate aspect. In a few cases a final
-a- vowel of the stem when used iteratively (or continuatively) contrasts with an -i- of the stem when used semelfactively, e. g.:
up-vq-(w)i-to bounce (once)-q i- semelfactive intransitive (§
30,3)ovwoq(w)a-y(s)ito bounce up
and down
-ya- continuative intransitive (§
30,1)(d) Vocalic alternation to indicate active {-a·-) and mcdio-passive or
static (-<-). A very considerable number of verb stems alternate in
their final vowel between α• and i, a smaller number between yaand i. The former form of the stem is used for the active intransitive
(or transitional) voice, the latter for the medio-passive, static, or
resultative voice. The i- forms seem to be durative, the a - forms
tend to be momentaneous. Examples are:
i -p otsin'i-l- ai- to be ready to
start off
muntun'ni- to lie covered up
qji'ni- to hang together in two
parts
-m'unuqwito be round
noq am'mi-(k- ai-) to be b e n t , n j q j m i- to bend (slowly; intr.)

appreciable difference in meaning between the i- and a- forms,
though this may be due to inadequate translation, e. g.:
tcuywito approach (tr.)
rin'ito be frightened, surprisedtcuywunri'ya•-dit.
dit.(e) Alternation of transitional -i- and static -a -. This type, apparently the exact opposite of the preceding, is sparsely represented,
e. g.:
to be fullpono'a•-jano'i-to become full( f ) Alternation of intransitive -i-, -a - and transitive -a-.
In these
verbs it Ls difficult to discover the difference in meaning between
the -i- and -a - forms (cf. d above). In some cases only -i- alternates
with -a-. T h e alternation of -i- and -a- is evidently an old Uto-Aztekan
feature; cf. such Xahuatl doublets as cotoni τ ο BREAK (intr.): cotona
τ ο WOUND, CUT; tomi τ ο OPEN UP (intr.): toma τ ο OPEN (tr.), DELIVER;
and numerous others. Paiute examples are:

lengthened vowel before
(2) CONSONANTAL AFFECTION. Two groups of cases are to be
recognized, glottalization and gemination of stem consonants. These
seem to be equivalent processes. Not infrequently they occur together in the same form, e. g. tska'pin'NA το CUT (momentaneously):
ts-kaniNA το CUT (duratively).
(a) Glottalization of verb stems. This process operates:1. To indicate distribution, e. g.:
fVA'tcü'ywiyuni
waijwi-fourseveral standyun a- to put several down (in
one place)wa'a'yWAtcÜTjwiyun C eight (lit.,
four here and there)
wa'a'rjwituip'iya' caused (them)
each to stand
yuna'(a)ito put down in several places2. To indicate iteration, e. g.:
iyon a- to carry in one's arms
ya-vayaito feariyan'na- to carry several times
yi'i-p-aq ai- to be afraid several
times (note irregular change of
-a - to -Ϊ -)3. To indicate momentaneous activity, e. g. -n'na- momentaneous
transitive with singular object: -n a- durative transitive with singular
object (§ 30, 4).
Glottalization alone as a grammatical process is relatively rare.
Generally it accompanies distributive or iterative reduplication (see
§ 58, 3 and 4), less often gemination alone (see b).
(b) Gemination in verb stems. Gemination primarily denotes
momentaneous activity; the contrast between momentaneous and
durative, as might be expected, tends to become one of singularity
and plurality. Gemination is very commonly employed with the
momentaneous suffixes -q i- (§ 30, 3) and -n'na- (§ 31, 2, c). Other
examples of momentaneous gemination are:Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanSOUTHERN PAIUTE,(iyai-A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGEto happennay am- to seem

qi-nipuywito gnaw
tup un'ni- to wake up (at once)
no 'ot vato appear pregnant
(right off)
yi'ik i- one swallows
-qi- momentaneous suffix (§ 30,3)Far less frequently gemination indicates iterative activity, e. g.:
qaqafi-to run awayya-vayai-to fearqaqat'ito run away several
times
yV'i-paqaito be afraid several
timesEven these examples are really but special forms of gemmation
accompanying reduplication. Combined gemination and reduplication, to indicate distribution or iteration, is common (see § 58, 3, h;
§ 58, 4, a, d, f).
§ 54. Singular and. plural stems.
All verbs are determined as regards singularity or plurality of the
subject, less often of the object also; the singular form includes
reference to the dual. The most common method of indicating
plurality of the subject is by the use of the suffix -q a- (§ 31, 1, c); for
other suffixes indicating or implying plurality of subject or object, see
§ 31, 1, a and b; § 3 1 , 2 , a-d. Vocalic alternation of the final vowel of
the stem is also sometimes associated with change of number (see § 53,
1, b). The idea of distribution expressed by reduplication often passes
over into that of plurality of the subject or object (see § 58, 3).
Besides these formal methods of expressing number, there are
certain verb stems that are inherently limited in their reference to
number, the singular-dual of the intransitive subject or transitive
object being expressed by a stem which is etymologically distinctX Southern Paiute and Ute
242SAPIRfrom that for the plural of the intransitive subject or transitive object.
Certain of these stem contrasts are:
qari- one sits, dwells
avi- one lies
w'in i- one stands
pa(i)yione returns
pit<A- one arrives
pay(a)ione goes, walks
ap'iione sleeps

nu'a- to throw down several
(/si)-yway(a)i- to stick in several
(cf. wayi- above)
mimio'i(reduplicated) several
break off (irregularly related
to singular form)Several of these verb stems are also used as the second element
in compound verbs. T h e whole verb may be characterized as singular
or plural in this w a y ; a pluralizing -q a- may thus become unnecessary,
e. g. ivi- O N E D R I N K S : im-k a- S E V E R A L D R I N K , but ivi-ywin-'i- O N E
DRINKS S T A N D I N G : iviywaywi- S E V E R A L DRINK S T A N D I N G .
Singularity
or plurality of the object is not disturbed by composition, e. g.
paq a-rjw'in 'i- O N E STANDS AND K I L L S O N E ; paq a-rjwaywi- S E V E R A L

tuywi- fire goes outqatcvn avitci- several get tired out
patcaq winavitci- several get wet
tuywinavitci- fires go out§ 55. Verb syntax.
Under this head may be conveniently grouped a number of phenomena that affect the verb in relation to other words in the sentence.
( 1 ) SUBORDINATING ELEMENTS.
Subordinate clauses, denoting
cause, time, condition, concession, or attendant circumstance, are
extremely frequent in Paiute. Those of these clauses that are used
with logical subjects put them in the objective form. Thus, a
sentence like WHEN I CAME, YOU WERE AWAY is rendered WHEN ME
CAME, YOU WERE AWAY.
In all probability the objective is in these
cases to be interpreted genitivelv, the subordinating element as a
specialized postposition; e. g. AT MY COMING, YOU WERE AWAY.
This receives some support from the fact that a few of the ordinary
postpositions may be suffixed to verb forms (see 2 below). However,
of the verb-subordinating elements only -yu- (see c below), possibly
also -qu- (see e), is employed also with nouns (see § 50, 4, 49). The262X Southern Paiute and Ute
244SAPIRtense elements -pa·- (§ 32, 4) and -q-ai- (§ 32, 3) may precede the
subordinating suffix, but not the other tense elements. Five subordinating suffixes are found, the first three of which introduce
clauses referring to the subject of the main clause, the other two
clauses with a different subject.
(a) -tsi- gerund. Subordinates in -tsi- are here termed gerunds
because they have no expressed subject, though they may have an
object. Their logical subject is always the same as that of the main
clause. They indicate antecedent circumstance or activity and
are most appropriately translated in English by participial phrases:
HAVING — E D .
I t is at least possible that the gerund -i st.- is etymologically related to the animate noun suffix -tsi- (§ 24, 1, f); such a sentence
as HAVING so DONE, H E RETURNED would then originally have meant
THE ONE WHO DID so RETURNED.
Examples are:
maa'iisiyw imi'ywa'aiijiVA pa(i)yi'kiva'
find-gerund-him
(inv.) thouwith-him (inv.) return-hither-will; having found him with you, (he)
will come home
%nik mjum'its· min i's-'its mjwa'i-uikaijupiya'
after having so done
(plur.), having returned, (they) caused (it) to rain
iini'ts·, %ni'Tjuts• having so done, then (frequently used as sentence
connector); uniyutsiyiVA
then he (inv.)
rii' non-o'cC qwiya'tcitciqarfwdsI dream-present bear-becomegerund, I dream that I turned into a bear
Future gerunds in -va t-si-, -vipatsiBEING ABOUT TO—are also
very common and frequently found in idiomatic turns. Examples
are:
axa'ny-kava(sL7jwar)w a'l-kaVh o w - d o - p l u r a l - f u t u r e - g e r u n d - h i m (inv.)-ye say-plural-present? being about to do what with him say ye?

(b) -kai- W H E N , WHILE, AS; appears as spirantized -yai- or nasalized
-Tjqai-. This is a true subordinating suffix, attached to verb forms
whose subject is the same as that of the main verb. While -t si-Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE245forms denote antecedent activity, -kai- forms denote contemporaneity
of action. Examples are:
sv'vw'ar)WA qari'm'miuxa' t'(ψνϊ'ιυα if (§ 60, 2, d)-he (inv.) sit-move-as
fall-will; if he rides, he will fall down

qa '(a)i pay(a)'it)ka
sings while walking
qAxqa! t-V p'iya' cua'yumLykadikwA
sat (iteratively) while eating it
(inv.) u p each time
-kai-c-u- (with enclitic -cu-; see § 19, 2, k) often implies immediate
sequence: AS SOON AS, e. g.:
a'iiaic-u άηα'ψΰαφι quna'manti wTqa'm'Mi'kaipiya'
say-as-just
coyote fire-at-being (obj.) covered; as soon as Coyote said so, (he)
covered some of (the) fire
Concessive clauses of the same subject as the main clause are
formed by appending -c-ampa- (§ 19, 2, j) to -kai-, e. g.:
iya'xaxayqaic ampa yA though fearing him (vis.), (he went to meet
him)
(c) -yu- WHEN, WHILE, AS. This subordinating suffix seems to
be identical in meaning with -kai- (see b above). I t is suffixed only
to stems or verb suffixes ending in -ai-. I t always replaces -kai- after
verb suffixes ending in -ai- (e. g. resultative subordinate -q-ai-yuWHEN SAYING, not *-q-ai-yai-).
After verb stems in -ai, -kai- is
used (e. g. ai-yai- WHILE SAYING), unless followed by enclitic -c-ampa-,
but not, e. g., -cu- (hence ai-yai-c u-, but ai-yu-c ampa-).
Examples
of -yu- clauses are:
niijwl'xaiyu' n'ni person-be-as-thou do! act like a person!
naijqa'q ai'yvq IVA when (he) heard it (inv.)
Clauses in -yu-cu-, analogous to those in -kai-c-u- and -ku-c-u-,
are found after verbal suffixes in -ai-, e. g.:
•Uni'k-aiyvc u un""i'k-upiya do-resultative-as-just fall-momentaneouspast; while so doing, (he) fell down
Concessive clauses in -yu-c ampa- replace forms in -kai-c ampaafter all verbs in -ai-, e. g.:X Southern Paiute and Ute246SAPIR

qa'tcv qv'qwLTi'waiYUcampA not shoot-negative-as-only; though not
shooting, (he kept on singing)
(d) -q a- WHEN - , IF. This subordinating suffix characterizes antecedent temporal and conditional clauses whose subject is different
from that of the main clause. Examples are:

"INTRODUCTORY NOTE
The order of the letters of the Paiute alphabet used in this dictionary
is based on that of the letters of the English alphabet, except that
certain letters, symbolizing secondary sounds, are considered mere
variants of others, symbolizing primary sounds. Thus, ν is considered
a variant of p; r, of t; k and y, of q; kw and yw, of qw; c, of s; ts, of tc;
and o, of u.
The order, then, of initials and medials in the main entries is as
follows:
InitialMediala
i-a-i-ϊ-Ϊ-m
n-m-n-η-qw-o-o-P-p-q (k)-q- (-k-)
-y-qw (kw)-q w- (-k w-)

t- S - (-C-)-t-tc (ts)-r-tc- (-ts-)
-t c- (-t s-)u (o)-U- ( - 0 - )w
y-y--' (only as enclitic)Of the nasalized stops, -mp- comes after -mo-; -nt- comes after
-no-·, -ψι~ comes after -T)3-\ and -ijqw- comes after -ijq-. A reduplicating syllable does not count. Further, note that ' or h plus vowel
is considered equivalent to that vowel. Long vowels or repeated
vowels summing to two moras (e. g., aa — a ) come after short
vowels; syllables affected by ' (whether of type 'a or a', which areX Southern Paiute and Ute
540SAPIRconsidered equivalent) come after equivalent syllables not so affected.
Thus, for words with initial α the order is:
a
a'a
ä(""a, ha)
(aa)
(a', a'a)
(ii'j ä j et- ä jThe main entries and sub-entries are given as stems and elements
in a thoroughly normalized form, no vocalic variants (e. g., t for ϊ)
being recognized. All voiceless vowels are restored to their voiced
form. This means that no voiceless spirants are entered, for these
are merely secondary forms of voiced spirants before voiceless vowels.
Non-initial stops following voiceless vowels are restored to their
fundamental geminated form. E. g., the recorded qA'qa'RA appears
as the entry qaq ara-. On the other hand, the actually recorded
forms, which follow these theoretically fixed entries, are given as
notated, with all their regular phonetic changes and in their heard
variants. Final -* after consonant, however, is regularly restored to
its proper voiceless vowel; e. g., qani'ay' would be given as qaniai)A.
There are also other slightly regularizing changes which will help the
student. For compounded stems beginning with -ν-, see p-; with
-τ-, see <-; with -γ-, see q- (k-); with -yw-, see qw- (Jew-); with -ψο-,
see w- or m- (a few cases of -yw-, however, where the evidence for
derivation from w- or m- is lacking, are separately entered under
-ψν-).
The main entries are in roman small capitals (the vowels are in these
always to be interpreted as fundamental voiced vowels). Under
these the sub-entries are given in indented italic form; they consist
of derivatives of the main entries.
The following symbols are used:

"There are two groups of suffixed elements that indicate voice, i. e.
direction of action with reference to subject, object, or indirect object.
The first group (1-9) is a primary series that is not freely used; that is
closely welded with the verb stem (often with internal stem changes);
that occurs in contrasting pairs of mediopassive (or intransitive)
and active (or transitive); and that, for the most part, involve at the
same time other ideas than that of voice, namely verbal aspect (see
3 below) and number. This group will be only listed here for convenience of reference and taken up later under other headings. The
second group (10-14) is used with great freedom and indicates voice
relations of a somewhat more external sort. Suffixes of the latter
sort are often appended to the former.
(1) -q-i- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of momentaneous aspect
and singular number (see § 30, 3).
(2) -71-, (-ijqi-) mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of iterative-durative aspect (see § 30, 2).
(3) -ya- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of durative aspect (see
§ 30, 1).
(4) -tcai- mediopassive (intransitive) suffix of primarily durative
aspect and of plural number (see § 31, 2, a).
(5) -na- transitive suffix of durative aspect and singular number
of object (see § 31, 2, b).
(6) -n'na- transitive suffix of momentaneous aspect and singular
number of object (see § 31, 2, c).
(7) -tea- transitive suffix of plural number of object (see § 31, 2, d).
(8) -a - final stem vowel indicating active voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -i- (9).
(9) -i- final stem vowel indicating inactive voice (see § 53, 1, d);
correlative of -a - (8).
(10) -rjqi-"" transitivizing or activating suffix appended to verbs
of primarily mediopassive aspect. It is particularly common with
preceding -q i-, -yi- (1 and 2 above) and generally occurs with an
instrumental prefix in the verb (§ 21). Before it mediopassive -i- (see
9 above) sometimes becomes active -a - (8); an -a- of the active stemX Southern Paiute and Ute

LANGUAGE145The idea of FOR quite often leads to the ""ethical dative."" In such
cases the person of the indirect object is not really affected by the
action at all but is merely interested in it. Such ethical datives with
first person indirect object are frequently employed to indicate an
affectionate attitude on the part of the speaker, e. g.:

form of an older variable -r'ui-, -t ui-, -ntui-, which has become
generalized for all cases. There seems also to have been an alternation between momentaneous -t'ui- andd urative -r'ui- (see § 53, 2, b).
An example of causative -ntui- is 'a'cmtui- τ ο LIKE. Causative
-r'ui- (durative) is exemplified in iyä'r'ui- το CAUSE TO BE AFRAID, TO
FRIGHTEN; with this contrast momentaneous iya'tuiτο FRIGHTEN
(at one moment of time).
(12a) -n-i- causative. This element occurs so uncommonly t h a t
it has not been found possible to determine its precise application.
Examples are:

Ν A' SO'XO' ma'mp'iya'
covered (him)self with moist ground, dirt (cf.
also NA^sa'xu'map 'iya' covered self with dirt)
In the last two examples, which are provided with reflexive prefixes, it is to be noted t h a t the reflexive is better considered the logical
object of the causative suffix than of the verb; e. g. HE CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE COVERED, not HF. CAUSED TO COVER HIMSELF.
Contrast,

HE COVERED TO HIMSELF.(13) -ti -s passive; sometimes heard as -H-, but always twomoraed. This suffix is freely used to make true passives out of
transitive verbs. Examples are:

The last two examples illustrate passive participles in -t'i-ri-n (cf.
§ 25, 6, a). These differ from passive participles in -pi- and -p'i(§ 25, 5) in referring to passing or non-characteristic states. Contrasting with SA'pi'x-AtiRi, for instance, is SA'pi'xam ip i ONE WHO
IS ALWAYS OVERCOME (-m i- is usitative, § 30, 10).
Passives may be readily formed from causatives, e. g. ivi'( uii}uti tca r)A D R I N K - C A U S E - M O M E N T A N E O U S - P A S S I V E - P R E T E R I T -H E , HEWASHere the causative suffix precedes the passive,
as is to be expected. Curiously enough, the same order is followed
in causatives of passives, an indirective -rjqi- coming in between the
causative suffix and the passive - t i - , e. g.:
CAUSED TO DRINK.uiyki'fi v""'a yarayWA
catch-cause-to-passive-shall-he-us, he will
get us caught (lit., he will cause to us to be caught)
pA'qa'niuiyqiti tca rjA kill-cause-to-passive-preterit-him, (he) caused
him to be killed (for -nlui- cf. 12 above)
maa'i(In other words, the passive suffix can not precede the causative.
In the preceding examples the indirective is required to point to the
logical object as the indirect object, the passive of the verb itself
being apparently conceived of as the direct object, e. g. H E WILLCAUSE-BEING-CAUGHT TO-US.
That these forms are causatives of
passives, not, as would be inferred from their appearance, passives of
causatives, is proved by the absence of a plural subjective -q a- (see
§ 31, 1, c) in the first form above; this would be required if the fomr
were to be understood as WE SHALL B E CAUSED TO B E CAUGHT BY HIM.
(14) -tu'a-' (-t' ua- ) impersonal. Verbs with impersonal subject
or, less often, object refer either to an indefinitely defined person or
to a collectivity, people in general. In the latter case, if used sub
jectively, it may be preceded by the pluralizing -qa- (§ 31, 1, c). The
impersonal suffix is often employed as the equivalent of the passive,
never simultaneously with it. It follows perfective -qai- and narrative preterit -ρϊ(α)·γαί-, but precedes present -yi- and future
-va (nia)(see § 34). Curiously enough, present -yi- regularlyX Southern Paiute and Ute
148SAPIRfollows -tu'a- even in preterit tense forms (cf. also -p• la-yai-tua-y'i-; §
32, 8). As already noted (§ 19, 2, e), it is frequently accompanied
by enclitic -w oa-. Examples of subjective -t-u'a- are:
pAKqa'rju(ua{i)ylayA kill-momentaneous-impersonal-present-him, they

As impersonal object -t u'a-' seems to be used only indirectly after
-rjqi-, e. g.:

play-hand-game-to-impersonal-plural-past,

These examples show that -yqi-i ua- generally denotes cooperation
with a group. Moreover, the two suffixes form a close unit, as they
occur before elements that would normally precede -t-u'a- alone (e. g.
-yw'ai- ΤΟ GO TO, narrative preterit -p 'iyai-, plural subject -q-a-);
see above examples.
§ 30. Suffixes of verbal aspect.
By ""aspect,"" a term borrowed from Slavic grammar, is here meant
the temporal range of the action, i. e. its definition with respect to
such concepts as momentaneousness, durativeness, inception, iteration. These and like concepts have no primary connection with
the concept of relative time, which is the province of the temporal
suffixes (§ 32).","[161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166]"

independent personal pronouns, as of other pronouns and of nouns,
are used as subjects of verbs, unless these are subordinate; as objects

for attached postpositions (§ 50, 3). Examples of independent subjective personal pronouns (including pronoun and postposition) are:rii' qa 'i' I sing

used as objects (direct or indirect) of transitive verbs; as subjects of
subordinate verbs (§ 55,1); and as genitives. Examples of independent
objective personal pronouns are:n%'ni a Jyawantciyqimu\'

An independent subjective pronoun may be combined with an independent
objective one, the former apparently preceding, e. g.:imi ηϊ'ηίΑ pAxqq.'umpa n iA thou me wilt-kill

I kill-you (plur.) you (plur. obj.)
As a rule, however, only one of the pronouns is independent, the
other being attached as an enclitic (see § 40, 6).

Most of the enclitic
pronouns may be used either subjectively or objectively. The
objective forms of the second person are formed from the corresponding subjective forms by the addition of -m i-, perhaps identical with
the -m i - of independent m i - T H O U ; - y n m i - < -Tjw'imi(§ 3, 3, d).
The dual animate enclitic -' . . . m i - is a subjective element; it is
outwardly identical with
. . .m i.'-, the third person plural animate
invisible element, but, though in certain cases very difficult to keep
apart from the latter (which, when the verb is singular in form,
necessarily has a dual reference), is clearly distinct from it, as it may
refer to all animate persons, including the third person animate
visible. -®i- is only used in a possessive sense and is evidently somewhat in a class by itself. The position of the pronominal enclitics
with reference to other enclitic elements has been already spoken of
(see § 19, 4).
The enclitic pronouns are closely related, for the greater part, to
the corresponding independent pronouns. The first person singular
-ni- is connected with, though not identical with, the independent
rii', ni-; this vocalic alternation is probably an old Uto-Aztekan
feature, cf. Nahuatl independent ni I with proclitic ni- I, ME. The
other enclitics of the first person are identical with the corresponding
independent pronouns, t- becoming spirantized to -r- (-tc- after -i-).
The -' of the second person singular is entirely peculiar to the enclitic series; - ψ ν ϊ - and - r j u m i - of the plural are doubtless spirantized
from *m'i{m i ) - , cf. independent m 'im i-.
The visible forms of the
third person are compounded of demonstrative -a- and the pronominal
elements -rja-, -m 'i-, and -q a- already discussed in § 39, 1. The
invisible forms are compounded of an accessory -'- and the same pronominal elements, a -w- being inserted in the animate singular and
wwX Southern Paiute and Ute184SAPIRthe inanimate. This
. . . -w- may be a specialized form of
demonstrative "" ' « ' - THAT (invisible). T h e reflexive possessive -v'iseems to have no independent analogue, unless, indeed, it be connected
with relative pi- (§ 45); cf. probably also Shoshonean *pi- HE, HIS
(Cahuilla pe HE, pehe- HIS; San Juan Capistrano po- HIS).
(2) USE OF SUBJECTIVE FORMS. The subjective enclitics may be
used as the subject of a non-subordinate verb or as the object of an
imperative (§ 52).
The animate dual -' . . .πιϊ-, however, of
which examples will be given separately, functions only as a subject,
sometimes also as a possessive. Subjective examples of enclitic
pronouns, attached both to verbs and to other parts of speech, are:

they (inv.) are good
7nwava'ami qari'p 'iya' there-they (inv.) dwelt(vis.) do-usita-In connection with the use of second person singular -' certain
peculiar contraction phenomena are to be noted. Ordinarily the
pronominal -' does not amalgamate with a ' in the last syllable of the
word to which it is attached (e. g. from -ywa'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO
is formed ηα'υ,'ψναίχινα'αί''
GO THOU AND HANG THYSELF!), but inSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE185other cases such amalgamation takes place, so that no specific pronominal element is apparent at all. This is notably the case with
interrogative -ru'a-, e. g.:
im'yiro'"" art thou drinking? ( < -ro'a- + -'; not -ro'a')
cu(w)a'ru' nyn o'c C maybe you'll dream
Probably this difference of treatment has something to do with the
difference between inherent and accessory ' (§ 15, 1). Furthermore,
the pronominal
is lost in certain cases, notably after qatcu- NOT,
after demonstrative ai- (§ 43, 5), and before ai- τ ο SAY and ani- τ ο
DO; a final -a is then elided before following a-. Examples are:
qatcu' n a 'n ia'ap-A not-thou say-negative, do not say anything
a'i(y) igiT a'iimA that-obj.-thou indeed say-usitative, you are indeed
wont to say ( = ai-a- iy'ir, cf. a'ian iy'ir that-I indeed)

αχα'ηίχαί 'anik -.i what-do-subordinating-thou do? why do you do
so? ( = -jfoi' *ani-)
The third person inanimate enclitic pronouns (-aqa- and -' . . .q wa-)
are very often used, as in English, in an impersonal sense, particularly
in references to the weather. Examples are:
u7)wa'(i)y'iaq A it is raining (said by one who sees it raining)
ui)wa'(i)'yiqwA
it is raining (said by one who does not see it rain)
nia'va n-i'aq-WA it will blow

who-it (inv.) then? who is it, then?
Subjective examples of animate dual -' . . .m l- are:
mami qa 'y'tmi they 2 (vis.) sing (not equivalent to qa 'y'imi they 2
inv. sing, as ma'mi implies visibility, but to qa 'yiam'i they 2 sing;

in qa 'yiami merely implied because of singular form of verb)

(3) USE OF OBJECTIVE FORMS. Objective forms are used as objects
of transitive verbs, as subjects of subordinate verbs, and as possessives.
For their use in subordinate verb forms, see § 55, 1. Possessives,
exemplified only in noun forms, are treated below (4). Examples
of enclitic pronouns in a properly objective sense are:

with nouns. Inasmuch, however, as such an enclitic, even when
appended to a noun, can have objective (or, in most cases, also subjective) significance, a theoretical ambiguity sometimes results. Thus,
a form like qam'anl HOUSE-OBJ.-I (or ME, MY) may be interpreted
as signifying either MY HOUSE (obj.) or I (DO so AND so το) A HOUSE.
The form of the whole sentence or the context generally removes
the ambiguity. In practice a noun with possessive enclitic is generally
followed by a postnominal article-pronoun, e. g. qani'an am MYHOUSE (OBJ.) IT, in which case no ambiguity is possible. Examples
of possessive enclitics are:
purjqu'm my horse; qu'tcu'mpuyquTjwini my cattle (lit., buffalo-pets)
dci'nipA'tca'n-cc'RI to*to'q wa'ar/q'ithis-me mocasin-myitpatch(distributively)- for, patch these moccasins of mine for me

yaya 'ma q-A end-at-its, at its end
A'SI'a-(i)ya'Q WA its surface, bark (obj.)
nia 'viy'wa m,· aijA chief-possessed-their (vis.) he, their chief
pi{y)a""am'i their (inv.) mother
Instead of -am'i- THEIR (vis.) and -' . . .m i- THEIR (inv.) are
sometimes found the corresponding singular forms -αηα-, -' . . .rjwa-.
This takes place, though not always, when the person referred to by
the enclitic pronoun precedes with the plural animate suffix -ψνϊ(-TO I-; § 48,1), evidently in order to avoid a double plural. Analogous
phenomena will meet us again (§ 41, 1, e; § 42, 2 and 5). Examples of
this ""number dissimilation"" in possessive forms are:
qum a'rjwia m,· αηΑ ma 'ai>LTjWAhusband-plural-objective-theirhe( = them; § 42, 2, end) chief-his (inv.; = their inv.); their-husbands206X Southern Paiute and Ute

below)
""'a't iywayw'ia'aywA good-possessed-plural-obj.-his (inv.), their (inv.)
good ones (anim. obj.), good ones (anim. obj.)
The reflexive possessive -vi- occurs only in objective forms, i. e.
after objective -a-, -ya- (§ 49, 1); after nominalizing -n a- (§ 25, 3); and
after postpositions, which are syntactically equivalent to the objective (§ 50, 3). The reflexive possessive indicates t h a t the possessor is
the same person as the subject of the sentence. Ordinarily it refers
to the third person, but it may also be employed in first and second
personal references. Examples <)f its use are:
qaiu 'u'r<i paa'iav utjWA house (obj.) it-towards aunt-obj.- own she

Explicitly plural (or dual) forms of the third person reflexive possessive are also found; they are compounded of -am 'i- THEIR (vis.)

(5) PLEONASTIC FORMS.
Double (or even more frequent)
expression of pronominal elements is very common in Paiute. Examples of the repetition of the subjective or objective pronoun, both
pronouns enclitic or one enclitic and the other independent, have
occurred in preceding lists. There is a marked tendency for the
objective enclitic pronoun to attach itself to the verb even if it is
elsewhere expressed in the sentence; in transitive sentences the
enclitic subject seems to be normally attached to the verb only in
combination with the enclitic object (§ 41, 2, a). Particularly characteristic is the employment of enclitic possessives together with
genitives (i. e. objectives) of the corresponding independent pronoun, e. g.:
n'i'mA pavi'lsinime my-elder brothermaya'iA ραα'ατ/Λ h i m h i s - a u n tpi 'xäSiTj'w'im imi'A pigs-thy thee, thy pigs
imi'A paa'i'ami thee aunt-obj.-thy, thy aunt (obj.)
Pleonasm is abundantly illustrated also in nouns, which are often
anticipated or redundantly referred to by pronouns, independent or
enclitic. Of such usages also examples have already been given.
Particularly frequent is the occurrence of an objective enclitic pronoun
of the third person with an objective noun, e. g. ι SEE-IT HOUSE (OBJ.)
as equivalent of ι SEE HOUSE (OBJ.). In genitive constructions this
is almost the rule, e. g. ραα'ία η.ι qaniar/A AUNT-OBJ.-HIS HOUSE-HER,
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE; also paa'iarjA
qanl.

These comprise examples of w h a t
is ordinarily known as noun incorporation. T h e absolutive or
classificatory suffix of the noun is frequently lost in noun-verb compounds. The syntactic relation implied between the verb and its
incorporated noun may be of various sorts. T h e incorporated noun
may be an instrument; it may indicate similarity; it m a y function
as a direct object; it may have local significance; it may function
as the subject of the verb; it may be a predicate of the subject; or it
may be a predicate of the object. Any of these relations may be,
and more often is, expressed by properly syntactic or morphological
processes. I t is not possible to give a simple rule as to when noun
incorporation is possible or required, whether, e. g., to say Ι TRAILSEEK or Ι SEEK A TRAIL. There is a good deal of option in this matter,
but m a n y cases of incorporation are fixed by idiomatic usage. There
is some tendency to express what might be called characteristic or
generalized relations by syntactic means. Any general and valid
rule, however, is hardly to be formulated.

"(5) TREATMENT OF y. The back-guttural y is apt to undergo
various modifications, aside from unvoicing (§ 8), palatalization (4
above), and labialization (§ 14, 3, c).
(a) Stopping to g. In poetry y is not infrequently stopped to
g (the sonant correspondent of q). In prose this occurs when a final
-y of the preceding word comes, by elision of an initial vowel (see §
10, 3, end), to stand immediately before the -γ-, e. g. a'ia-η ϊγϊκ
THAT-HE INDEED >a'ia-η gin.(b) Weakening or loss of y. An original y is sometimes weakened
to a glide y or even entirely lost before or after an u- vowel, more
often after an ϊ- vowel. Vocalic contractions may then result (see
§ 4). Examples are:
na-^u'q wi-yqi- to fight (lit., to
shoot at each other < quq wito shoot)
yauywi- to enter

Even before a voiced vowel
y is sometimes heard not merely as an intermediate χ , with which
it varies frequently, but as a fully unvoiced χ (or lengthened i );
similarly y > x. This sharpening seems to be frequent after an
accented a, particularly in the neighborhood of a glottal stop, e. g.:
-ayava- yu- right among

whom you feared(6) VOCALIZATION OF SEMIVOWELS. T h e semivowels y and w
are sometimes opened up to the corresponding vowels i and u {o).
Forms with glide -i- (§5, 1) are transitional; e. g. -aya- > -a(i)ya- >
-aia-. Examples of -y- > -i- are:

54SAPIR( 7 ) SIMPLIFICATION OF CONSONANTS.
Here are grouped together
a number of consonantal simplifications or partial losses of characteristic quality, found chiefly in sentence phonetics.(a) Simplification of affricatives. A final -ts- ( < -tri-) or, less
often, -tc'f is sometimes reduced to -<·, -<·' before a word beginning
with a dental (f, n), less frequently before a word beginning with a
labial, e. g.:

When two successive syllables
contain sibilants of different articulation (s, ts: c, tc; see § 12, 2, h),Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGEassimilation generally results either to the s- or c- position.
following types of sibilant assimilation have been observed.","[70, 71, 72, 73]"
"In origin these are in all probability verb stems that have become
specialized as second members of verb + verb compounds (§ 18, 2, a).
This appears quite plausible in view of the fact that several verb
stems of movement (e. g. pay(a)i-n ΤΟ GO, pa(i)yi- ΤΟ RETURN) are
frequently used in composition in a quasi-formal sense.
(1) -ywa'ai-', -qwa'ai-', -yqwa'ai-' ΤΟ GO WHILE -ING, TO MOVE.
This is generally used only in verbs whose animate subject is singular.
For corresponding plurals the compounded verb-stem -mia- SEVERAL

thatofBECOMING.(2) -q-waai-'

This is evidently nothing
but a specialized use of the geminated form of the preceding suffix.
I t occurs, however, after spirantizing and nasalizing as well as after
geminating stems and is clearly felt as a distinct, though related,
element. Examples are:

-qwa'ai- and -ywa'ai- are to be classed under (a) or under (b) and
(c). I t is highly probable that -q wa'ai- (b) and -ywa'ai- (c) are
related to each other as momentaneous and durative (see § 53, 2, b for
momentaneous gemination). The two uses of -ywa'ai-, WHILE GOING
and το GO IN ORDER TO, are reflected in its plural correspondent
-m-ia-, e. g. qa'mia- SEVERAL SING WHILE ON (THEIR) WAY and
SEVERAL GO IN ORDER TO SING.(4) -m'mia- CONTINUOUS MOTION. This element, which is perhaps
etymologically connected with plural mia- SEVERAL TRAVEL, is very
similar in significance to -kwa'ai- (a) and to compounded -pay(a)iWHILE JOURNEYING.
The idea of continuity, however, seems to
be more explicit. Moreover, the movement referred to is not necessarily the straight-line movement of normal walking or travel, but
may be the periodic movement say of dancing. Examples are:

"Number is expressed in the verb in four different ways: 1, by
reduplication, properly a distributive formation but frequently
expressing plurality of subject or subject (see § 58, 3); 2, by the use of
distinctive stems for the singular and plural, a few of the plural
stems being used only as second members of verb + verb compounds
(see § 54); 3, by the use of suffixes indicating plurality of the subject
or, less commonly, of the object; 4, by the use of suffixes expressing
ideas of number and voice (transitiveness and intransitiveness) at
the same time. Only the last two processes are here discussed.
Even aside from pronominal elements, it is always possible to tell
from the form of a verb whether its animate subject is singular or
plural, often, also, whether its object is singular or plural. Verbs
with a dual subject are singular in form, but are differentiated in
practice from singulars by their employment of plural (or, in two
cases, distinctively dual) pronominal elements (§ 40). Thus,X Southern Paiute and Ute

( 4 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF PARTICIPLES.
Participles are extremely in
evidence in Paiute. They are employed in a variety of syntactic
ways:
(a) Attributively, when they may often be translated as relative
clauses or as adjectives.
(b) Denominatively, e. g. to'ywant'i FIGHTING > FIGHTER, secondarily HAVASUPAI INDIAN; uvwa-'nt aRi THERE-BEING IT, THE THING
THAT IS THERE.(c) Adverbially, particularly with verbalized postpositional forms,
e. g. tümpwi'a-ij 'am-nÜA p\rn'ka ROCK-OBJ.- HE (VIS), IT-AT-BEINGOBJ. LOOK, i. e. HE LOOKS THERE AT THE ROCK rather than H E SEES THE
ROCK THAT IS THERE.(d) Predicatively after verbs, particularly substantive verbs, e. g.
t'itc aro""ami ayan an-i'ntci THIS (INAN.) IS-USITATIVE HOW DOING?
HOW DOES IT WORK? qatcu an ik- %ijwaTjw'ait 'i NOT DOES RAINING
(NEG.), IT DOES NOT RAIN.(e) In lieu of finite verbs, particularly after independent personal
pronouns. Such participles may be considered as special cases of
predicative usages (d), the substantive verb being omitted. They
refer to general time as a rule. Examples are:
a'imintim'i say-usitative-participle-plural, (those) wont to say, (they)
always say
rii' to'ywanii I fighting, I am a fighter
i'mi cii'xaxwai't-uim-inünl
thou squaw-bush-get-go-causative-usitative-participle-me, you always cause ine to go to get squaw-bush
twigs
( 5 ) SYNTACTIC USE OF ADJECTIVES.
Practically all adjectives are
properly verbal in form. As such, they may be predicatively employed, like any verb; or, in participial form, attributively or denominatively (e.g. ""'a't 'i tiyo'qwdci
GOOD-BEING RUNNING, GOOD
RUNNER). They may also be employed, in their bare stem-form,
as the first, rarely second, elements of noun compounds (see § 18, 1, d
and e).
A few adjectives are properly nominal in form, e. g. imaf'p'its·Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE249i-'tump'i
OLD. An independent adjective may be used
attributively to refer to an incorporated noun, e. g.:
SMALL;mia""p 'itsiA wana' Rup'iya' little-obj. net-make-past, made a little net
§ 56. Substantive verbs.
Substantive verbs are
formed from the demonstrative stems a- and u- by means of a verbalizing -ro'a-: am'α- το BE (vis.), uru'a- το BE (inv.). These forms may
be used with all nouns, animate or inanimate, and independent
pronouns. These simple forms are also used as the nucleus of a
set of substantive verbs of specific pronominal reference, composed
of the pronouns urjwa- HE, um-'C- THEY, and uru- IT, to which are
respectively appended (not phonetically suffixed) aro'a- for the visible,
uru'a- for the invisible, forms. I t is remarkable that the u- pronouns,
which are properly invisible, should be used in visible substantive
verbs as well, visibility and invisibility being expressed by the a- or uof the verb proper. The pronominal substantive verbs thus are:
( 1 ) FORMATIONurjw aro'a-OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.h e is (vis.)umw aro'a- they are (vis.)
ur aro'a- it is (vis.)uy uru'a-h e is (inv.)urn uru'a- they are (inv.)
ur uru'a- it is (inv.)These may be conveniently written as single words, e. g. uraro'aIT is (VIS.). The present tense of substantive verbs is designated
either by the normal -y'i- (§ 32, 1) or, more frequently, by the
absence of a tense suffix. The substantive verb may also take on
other tense suffixes, the modal -νϊ - (§ 33, 2), the usitative suffixes
(§ 30, 10 and 11), the participial -η-, and the nominal abstract
-na(§ 25, 3).
( 2 ) U S E OF SUBSTANTIVE VERBS.(a) In perhaps the majority of cases the substantive verb follows
and is phonetically disconnected from its predicate noun or subject;
an adverb, however, may precede and the predicate noun follow the
verb. In these cases the final vowel of the word preceding the
substantive verb is elided. Examples are:

good-irrealis-past passive partic. it-is (inv.)present, it would be good
(b) A second method of employing substantive verbs is to attach
them to the preceding predicate noun or subject (noun or independent
pronoun), a glottal stop separating the a- or u- of the substantive
verb from the preceding final vowel, which is preserved; e. g. iici'
'aru'a- this (inan.) i s beside ''itc aru'a-. Perhaps such forms as iter'
'am'a- may be considered as verbs with incorporated nominal (or
pronominal) subject (§ 18, 2, f, t); e. g. Hci""aru'a~, cinaywavi'urywaro'a-.
Forms of this type are obligatory for independent pronouns of the
first and second persons. Examples are:

(c) The idea of B E I N G OF, B E L O N G I N G TO is normally expressed, as
illustrated above in several examples, by preceding the substantive
verb with an objective form of genitive significance, e. g.:

is it my property?
n\'ni \waru"""" me he-is, he is mine
imi' 'uraru"" (aru""anA) thee it-is (being), it is yours
By a curious idiom, however, the logical owner is sometimes put
in the subjective, the thing owned in the objective, as though the
substantive verb were to be translated directly as ΤΟ OWN, e. g.:

is highA long a- or an ai before final y + vowel (and, indeed, before y +
vowel generally) are practically indistinguishable phonetically,
owing to the i- glide after a- and the tendency of α· and ai to break
up into aa and aai respectively (see § § 5, 1; 4, 2, b). Both appear
as aai, a i, or, very characteristically before final y + vowel, as a.i,
a true diphthong in which the a and i melt lazily into each other.
Hence a final -ai' < -a{i)-yi- is acoustically quite distinct from -ai',
-a.i' < -a -y'i- or -ai-y'i-; the former -ai' is sharp, the latter somewhat
languishing in character, though not necessarily so long as to deserve
the orthography -ai'.

lost as such before a word beginning with a voiceless vowel or voiceless y or w (see 2 below). In such cases the voiceless ending of the

next. Particularly noteworthy is the formation of voiceless labialized

"Phoneticallythe form DID-1-AT-THE-HOUSE? is a perfect unit, morphologically it
is a word (qan i'-va - HOUSE-AT) plus a number of exteriorly segmented
elements that have no independent existence. Enclisis is thus neither
true suffixation nor juxtaposition of independent elements. I t has
the external characteristics of the former (including strict adherence
to certain principles of order), the inner feeling of the latter. I t is
one of the most characteristic processes of Paiute, doubtless ofSouthern Paiute, a Shoshonean
SOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEANLanguage

§ 19).
(3) PREFIXATION (see § 20). A considerable number of elements
is prefixed to stems; they consist chiefly of adverbial elements and
instrumental prefixes. They have purely derivational, not formal,
significance. In origin they are doubtless, at least in large part,
independent stems that have lost their individuality and now appear
only as first elements of compounds (with qu-a BY M E A N S O F F I R E ,

This is the most important
grammatical process of all. Under suffixes are included both derivational elements (e. g. agentive -vi-n, -mpi-n) and elements of strictly
formal significance (e. g. objective -a-, -ya-\ verb subordinating -yai-,
-q ai-, -rjqai-).","[88, 89]"
"( 1 ) T Y P E S OF GLOTTAL STOP.
Glottal stops occur very frequently
in Southern Paiute. They are rarely exaggerated in articulation,
however, and are often quite easily missed. The glottal stop may
function as an integral element of a stem (e. g. 'ayu- ΤΟ BE GOOD,
sa'a- ΤΟ BOIL) or grammatical element (e. g. -yw'ai- ΤΟ GO IN ORDER TO,
-n'ni- continuative); as in itself a grammatical process occurring alone
(e. g. dubitative -', § 19, 2, n; -'- to indicate momentaneous activity,
§ 53,2, a, 3), with such grammatical processes as gemination and reduplication (§ 53, 2, b; § 58, 3 and 4) or in connection with certain enclitics,
chiefly pronominal (e. g. -' . . . .-mi- THY, THEE) ; in certain circumstances to separate vowels brought together by composition (§ 16, 2);
in final position after perfective -{n)tca- and -ywa- and after independent personal pronouns preceding verbs of doing and being (§ 5, 3).
The last group of cases may be considered as inorganic or non-functional. The first group of cases may be defined as involving an ""inherent""
glottal stop, the second and third an ""accessory"" glottal stop. The
distinction is important phonetically, inasmuch as a syllable containing an ""inherent"" glottal stop counts for two moras whether its
vowel is short or long, while a short-voweled syllable with ""accessory""
glottal stop counts for only one mora (see § 8, 1, a, end; 2, a, end;
§ 9, end). Outwardly these two types of glottal stop are identical,
but they probably belong to quite distinct historical strata, the
""accessory"" group no doubt representing a later development or
influencing of the word form. Rarely there is evidence to show
that an ""inherent"" glottal stop may arise by way of compensation
for the loss of a vowel. This seems to be true, at least, of na'y'iVA'tsirjw'i FATHER ABD SON ( < reciprocal NA- Η — T / W O ' A Ü L - , spirantized

thus, it may be t h a t 10 and 11 should be reversed or, as probably
mutually exclusive elements, grouped together. Aside from doubts
of this sort, there are a number of disturbances of the above scheme
introduced by the impersonal -iua- and the passive -t-'i·-. First of
all, when -( ua- is used as indirect object of indirective -r/qi-, it follows
position 4 and precedes position 5 (see § 29, 14). Secondly, -tuaregularly precedes future -pa-(nia-)
(position 10), yet follows
position 12. Thirdly, the position of pluralizing -qa- (no. 5), which
regularly precedes e. g. momentaneous -rju- (position 7), is disturbed
in impersonal and passive forms. In these cases it falls between
positions 8 and 9, i. e. it follows passive -t-'i - but precedes perfective
-q ai- and impersonal -( ua-. Thus, with normal ivik arjuy'i- SEVERAL

impersonal -( ua- follows subordinating -Icu- (see § 55, 1, e) in spite of

"(1) COMPOUND N O U N S . Compound nouns are most easily classified
with reference to the nature of the first and second compounded terms.
Triple and quadruple compounds are always morphologically binary,
one or both of the terms being in turn compound. Thus, the examples
given above are to be analyzed as HORSE-TAIL + HAIR and BLOODROAST + ASK FOR. Nouns stems, particularly in initial position,
sometimes appear in abbreviated form; e. g. rii-n PERSON < ηϊψνϊ-',
na-n TRAIL < naywa-', pa-' WATER < pa·-*. For mo'o-' HAND is
sometimes usedTOO-»(cf. verb prefix ma-', § 20, 2). The qualifying
element regularly precedes. Noun compounds whose second element is a participle or adjective, though logically substantival, are
morphologically best interpreted as either verbs (adjectives) with
incorporated noun subject or object (see 2, f below) or, more frequently, participial derivatives of such verbs (adjectives).",[91]

"Post-nominal pronouns (or article-pronouns) are identical in form
with the shorter forms of certain of the independent third personal
pronouns (or demonstratives). T h e y are closely attached, though
not as phonetically amalgamated enclitics, to preceding nouns,
participles, adjectives, numerals, and pronouns, which they serve
to make clearly denominating terms. Frequently they hold together
a group of two or more words as a denominative unit, in which case
they may stand after the first word of the group instead of at the end.
T h e y are practically equivalent to postposed articles and are differentiated according to number, visibility and invisibility, animate and
inanimate, and, to some extent, case. On the whole, case distinctions
are neglected and primarily subjective forms often function also as
objectives. This seems to indicate a tendency towards development
into true articles. Ordinarily an article-pronoun follows immediately
upon the denominating term, but sometimes an intervening enclitic
(pronominal or other) element separates the two, e. g.

§ 43. Demonstrative pronouns.
There are four demonstrative stems, as already noted (§ 39, 1):
w
a- THAT (indefinite); i-,
THIS; ma-, m a'- THAT (visible; referred
to); and u-, "" V - that (invisible). These stems are not directly
used as independent demonstratives (except for rather infrequently
employed adverbs; a·, ma·'; see § 60, 2, d; 3), but need to be combined
with other elements. The following types of demonstrative usage
may be recognized:
( 1 ) DEMONSTRATIVE STEMS FOLLOWED BY POSTPOSITIONS.
These
are extremely common and correspond, in function, to inanimate
demonstrative pronoun + postposition. Examples are:ava"" that-at, there (indefinite)
aru'q-WA that-under, under it
maru'x-WA that (vis.)-to, to it
mava""anA that (vis.)-on, on it
mwa'va' that-at, there (not far away)
ι(y)t'nu this-at, here, present ( < i- a'n u-)
'i'va this-at, here
'i'upathis-through,
in this direction
uvwa"", 'u'vwax that (inv.)-at, there (inv.)
o 'p a'"" (< u-u'p-a'""), °'o'xpa'a (<'u'-up-a'"") t h a t ( i n v . ) - t h r o u g h , inyonder direction
( 2 ) DEMONSTRATIVESTEMS +THIRD PERSONPRONOMINALELE-MENTS. These forms function as independent third personal pronouns (§ 39, 1); as article-pronouns (§ 42); and as enclitic third personal pronouns (§ 40, 1). There is nothing further to be said about
them here except to note once more that these personal demonstratives
often preserve their proper demonstrative force.
( 3 ) V E R B S OF DOING. These are nothing but derivatives in -n i(§ 26,2, b) of the demonstrative stems. The idea of DOING, ACTING fre-Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE205quently passes over into that of HAVING SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ONE,
BEING. The verbs of doing are: an i- TO DO (indefinitely); mani'-,
mya'n i- τ ο DO (as indicated); in i'-, 'i'n-i- το DO IN THIS MANNER;
un i-, 'u'n i- τ ο DO IN THAT (narrated, unseen) MANNER. Examples

forms of similar morphology that serve as verbs of doing. Examples

"The text material presented in this paper belongs to two rather
distinct, though closely related, dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
branch of Plateau Shoshonean. The bulk of the paper is devoted
to mythological and other texts obtained in 1910 (February to May)
from Tony Tillohash, a young Kaibab Paiute from Kanab, in southwestern Utah; the balance, to mythological texts and one tale recorded
in English, secured in 1909 (August and September) from Charlie
Mack, a Uintah Ute from White Rocks, Utah.
The Ute texts were obtained at White Rocks in the course of a
brief trip among the Utes of Uncompahgre and Uintah reserves.
A further series of thirty Ute tales was obtained in English by my
colleague, Dr. J. A. Mason; these were published under the title of
"" Myths of the Uintah Utes"" in The Journal of American Folk-Lore
for July-September, 1910 (pp. 299-363). I should not fail to add
that Dr. Mason also obtained a series of interesting pictographs in
the course of a reconnaissance of Nine Mile Canyon, some distance
south of Uintah Reservation. This material is still unpublished.
More substantial for linguistics than the Ute work were the results
obtained from Tony, who was in 1910 just about to complete his
course at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Through the
kindness of Dr. G. B. Gordon, the director of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, and of the superintendent of the Indian
School, arrangements were made to have Tony housed in Philadelphia and employed at the Museum, so that he might be rendered available as a source of information for further Shoshonean
researches. Tony proved an excellent informant. Though young
and absent from his native home for about five years, he was of a
naturally conservative temperament and possessed of a remarkable
memory. Hence he was better informed on the subject of tribal
lore than could normally have been expected. His unfailing good
humor and patience also helped materially to lighten a task that
demanded unusual concentration. (Indeed, in all my linguistic
experience, I doubt if phonetic perception has ever been so severely
taxed as in recording Shoshonean dialects of the Ute-Chemehuevi
group.) Besides the Kaibab Paiute texts here presented, there wereX Southern Paiute and Ute
300SAPIRsecured from Tony supplementary material for the grammatical and
lexical study of his language; a series of over two hundred songs,
chiefly ceremonial, recorded in text and on the phonograph; and a
considerable body of ethnological information. The grammatical
data have been worked up into a sketch of the Paiute language,
which forms the first part of this volume. The lexical material follows in the third part. The songs and the ethnological data will
form the subjects of future papers. Tony, further, proved valuable
as a first-hand source for a seminar in American Indian linguistics
that I was then giving at the University of Pennsylvania. Last, but
not least, he was a delightful companion at all times and is remembered with the friendliest feelings by all who came in contact with
him in Philadelphia.
The linguistic relation of Southern Paiute (to be carefjlly distinguished from Northern Paiute or ""Paviotso"") to Uintah Ute is
close. Indeed, they are not so much closely related languages as
mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. This probably
applies to all the dialects of Ute-Chemehuevi, which may be defined
as a dialectically differentiated Shoshonean language stretching from
Uncompahgre Ute in central Colorado to Chemehuevi in southeastern
California. The texts embodied in the present volume are therefore
illustrative of one of the most widespread languages of aboriginal
America, though the specific dialects of the texts, Kaibab Paiute and
Uintah Ute, cover only restricted territories in southwestern Utah
and northwestern Arizona and in northeastern Utah respectively.
No attempt has been made to normalize the texts, which are given
here precisely as heard. The phonetic system used is that described
in the report of the Phonetic Committee of the American Anthropological Association ; l the symbols are defined in the key prefixed to
the texts. Those wishing to make an analytical study of the language
are referred to the Paiute grammar which precedes; the necessary
lexical assistance is given by the Paiute dictionary which follows.
In their mythological affiliations the tales recorded here evidently
correspond closely to the Ute, Shoshone, and Comanche tales already
published by Kroeber, Mason, Lowie, and St. Clair. References to
parallel tales have been confined to Plateau Shoshonean. Further
parallels from other Plateau tribes, from Plains tribes to the east,
and from California and Washington-Oregon tribes to the west are

194SAPIR(e) In combinations of the third person, the singular animate
precedes the plural animate, while the animate is always preceded
by the inanimate. Furthermore, two a- vowels coming together in
composition do not contract to a- but to a' (or 'a); e. g. -αηα'ηα- <
-arja—|—arja-, -aq aya- < -aq a- -\—aya-.
"" N u m b e r dissimilation""
(cf. § 40, 4) takes place when two animate plurals are combined,
the first enclitic becoming singular in form; hence -auf ami- < -amiami- as well as -aya-ami-, -ywa'm'i- < - mi-mi- as well as -rywa-mi-.
Such a form as -am'i'm'i- THEY 2-THEM (vi3.) is compounded of -am'iand animate dual
. . .mi-. A visible enclitic element is never combined with an invisible one (e. g. -aya'ywa- is impossible). Should it
be necessary to contrast a visible subject or object with an invisible
one, recourse must be had to the separation of the subject and object,
e . g . uywa'c'uqwivi'van-ia-q-AHE(INV.)-IT(INV.)DRINK-WILL-IT(VIS.), HE (INV.) WILL DRINK IT ( V I S . ) ; in combined form only
n iaAxqa'aijAHE (VIS.) WILL DRINK IT (VIS.) o rivi'va·-ivi'vaniaqwa'ayiVAH E (INV.) WILL DRINK IT (INV.) are possible.(f) The objective reflexive possessive -v'i- has not been included in
the table. I t does not seem to combine with elements of the first
and second persons. I t is very frequently combined with enclitic
elements of the third person, which it follows: -ayavi-, -ywavi-,
-amivi-, -m'iv'i-, -aqav'i-, -qwav'i-.
I t precedes the animate dual,
however: -vi'imi-.
(g) T h e animate dual, which is regularly subjective, follows all
third personal elements, including -vi- (see f above), but apparently
precedes the enclitics of the first and second persons. D a t a , however,
are quite imperfect for the latter cases. I t m a y be noted once more
that subjective animate plurals of the third person function as duals
if the verb is singular in form.

It is frequently added to distributive -yi- (§ 30, 2) or replaces singularSouthern Paiute, a Shoshonean

object.
(c) -n'na- momentaneous transitive with singular (chiefly inanimate) object.
(d) -tea- transitive with plural (chiefly inanimate) object; also
used as transitive distributive.
These three elements are best treated together, -n a- may be
considered the transitive (inanimate) correspondent of -yi- (§ 30, 2);

"Mourning Ceremonyor ""Cry""118As far east as the Paiutes of Muddy River, Nevada, and the Sibits of
St. George, but not as far as the Kaibab Paiutes, penetrated the annual
""Crying"" or Mourning Ceremony. This took place every summer (June
or July), rarely in the winter, and was intended to keep alive the memory
of dead relatives. Sacrifice was made by piling together in a heap objects
of value, such as blankets and baskets, also horses that had been shot,
and putting the whole on fire. An origin myth tells how the birds and
other animals, when they were people, came together long ago somewhere and bemoaned the fact that many were dying. The various animals
sang their characteristic mourning songs and these are now sung by the
Indians of today. In the ceremony four groups of singers are found,
each singing its characteristic songs. They are roan, coyote, birds (roosters and others) and mountain sheep. These sets of songs are different
in general character and are accompanied by different motions. There
are over 200 of them. The ""roan"" songs all begin with the word wäEfm
and, like all the other songs, are composed of unintelligible words,
presumably Mohave. 119 The ""roan"" singers kneel facing each other, their
leader being in the center between the lines, and nowadays accompanyKaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes835their singing by means of tin cans filled with shot. They have a peculiar
slanting downward motion of the hands. A man might join any group
of singers, but only songs of a fixed kind were sung in any one group.
Popular singers were paid for their services. The general expense of the
ceremony was born by two men, one of whom might be the brother of
a person that had died the preceding year. These visit the different
people of their own and neighboring bands and tell all to come together
at a certain place for the ceremony.
A ""Cry"" lasts five days and nights. One person and another whose
relatives have died make arrangements for the dance, and pay for the
feast; they let everybody know about it. According to myth, the ceremony originated in California. 120 They sing till 12:00 at night. On the
last night, they sing up to morning. Then the clothes and blankets are
burned. Animals and horses (sometimes 100)121 are driven to the mountains and choked. ""Birds"" stand in the road and go back and forth.
""Coyotes"" jerk the right arm up and down to imitate the trotting of
Coyote. ""Mountain sheep"" hold both hands in front and pull them up
and down. ""Roan"" singers line up opposite each other and sit and stand
alternately when tired. In the last night, people are not allowed to sleep.
About six officers keep them awake with pushing of a ""policeman's""
club. If one sleeps, he will get so sick that no medicine-man can cure
him. In the beginning of the dance, there is a cry of about ten minutes
at the command of a certain man, generally head of singing. Before
that there is a ""friendship"" ceremony in which two parties of people
face each other. People arrive at the meeting-place agreed upon in
several parties. When the second party arrives they all dismount from
their horses and line up to face a line composed of those who have
already arrived. The two lines approach each other and shake hands
and sing a song of friendship. The Cry leader goes around and tells
people about dead relatives to make them feel bad. [See Figure 13.]
Two girls back up towards the center line; the leader and assistant face
the girls. Home people gradually come closer and visiting people follow,
four in flank (not file). The leader explains his circuit around the center
line. As soon as he reaches the center, he tells them to go ahead and
cry. They cry two or three minutes. The leader sings together with four
while moving and circuiting. There is no particular time for making the
three center lines.
A ""period"" of a roan song should be sung in one single breath,
otherwise the continuity of the song is broken. A new breath is taken
just before the second waiün. While a song is sung, the leader is already836X SouthernPaiute and Utethinking of the next one, so that there is only a short pause before it.
As a rule, he tries to have each song sung only once during the night.
Once it is started again, it should be finished anyway.
Some roan songs have many words with long periods. Such are not
apt to be as well known as others, only the leaders being entirely familiar
with them. The others would try to follow the leaders, keep up for
awhile, and lose the thread towards the latter part of the period.
The annual Cry is said by a myth to have been introduced into the
Sibit122 (St. George) country by two old women long ago. They may be
seen as two rocks on opposite sides of the Virgin River a little below
Virgin City.
The ""new way"" of singing certain songs was first heard by Tony at
a dance held at East Fork [of the Sevier River] in Escalante country by
a St. George man in 1901.
In the ""Cry"" dance many bands participated together at a certain
place agreed upon, differing for each time perhaps; everyone had to be
let know about it before the party came to their particular place. The
""song leader"" and ""speech leader"" are separate people appointed before;
each group of songs has its leader.
Some good ""Cry"" singers of the Muddy River Indians can dream
their songs, like the Mohave.
[There should be payment] in the case of a song leader in a cry dance.
In the ""cry"" of 1901 held at East Fork [of the Sevier River], the song
leader was from St. George or Muddy River. No payment was agreed
upon beforehand; after the ceremony he was given payment. The payment used not to be great; anything at all would do that would show
his services were appreciated. If he were not paid, he would say nothing,
but the next time one of his band was requested to be a song leader,
they would refuse to do anything for stingy people.
Some of the ""cry"" songs belonged together in a set of two or three
and were sung together. Such were called ""brothers."" As a rule, there
was no fixed order to the songs; they might follow in any order as
determined at the moment by the song leader. There was no particular
length to a ""cry"" song. If they came to the end of a ""set of periods,""
the leader might tell them to go ahead and continue the song.
No mistake must be made in the singing of a ""Cry"" song. If one
makes an error, he will waste away with consumption.
The leader has a rattle of a baking powder can filled with shot, held
in the right hand as a rattle.123Kaibab Paiute EthnographicFieldNotes837Cry Dance of 1901
In 1901, Tom and Joe P ' ^ a x w i t ' 1 (both of Kanab) gave the Cry
dance for Tom's father who died two or three years ago. Joe was Tom's
uncle, brother of the deceased (the deceased man was not a chief, but
was rich and considered rather prominent). In the fall of 1900 council
was held at Kanab (niäviqwaix y ap' 'council'; niäviampayai' 'talk in
council'; women may talk in council, but hardly ever do). Mamputs
had come from Escalante in order to arrange for the Cry. It was arranged
to have the Cry in July of 1901. Tom had dropped a hint but not
explicitly said he would have a Cry; the hint was carried abroad to the
Arizona Paiutes and Muddy Rivers; in council all were Kanabs except
Mampiifs and assistant who went along with him. They met at the main
camp (of Young William with whom Tom was staying), but there was
no particular rule about the place of meeting. Tom was asked if he
would have a Cry; Tom then addressed the assembly and indirectly
asked Frank Mustache of St. George if he would get singers, whereupon
Frank said he would do what he could and, if some St. George person
would not act as song leader, he would be willing to do so. Frank said
he would see to it and get a ""whole set"" of St. George people to help
— one for talker, one for roan song leader (Tom Rice), and one for
assistant roan song leader (Sally Rice, Tsäxuts), while for other songs
(bird and coyote songs, greeting song) they expected to get help from
Muddy River, also roan singer from St. George (John Domingo); the
bird song leader of Muddy River, who used to be St. George, named
Wcanuxqwemi ~ W e an e nq wemi 'Bent Penis,"" coyote song leader of Muddy
River who was once of St. George was named Pävuts 'Little Spring (?)',
the greeting song man from Muddy River named ' wo ""tsf'. After the day
was set for the Cry, letters were written to Cedar City (Captain Peter124
is chief of the Cedar City band, of whom there are now about 30) and
to St. George. News came from St. George that they would come for
the Cry and all were looking forward to the Cry in July at YiVimparir
'East Fork' [of the Sevier River] (name = 'stream of water at which
pines end'), because Tom's father used to live around there (Escalante
band, dialect probably more like Cedar City; Q' u 'cärump' people at
Grass Valley [on the Sevier], chief Oäqar). Everybody saved money to
dress well (but absolutely no Indian finery) for a great time.
The Kanab Indians in the middle of June camped about one or two
miles east of Kanab, getting ready for the Cry (at a place called
W e aqoa + aitc' 'cedar grove bend, semi-circular cedar grove', where there838X SouthernPaiute and Utewas much good grass for pasture). Word was sent by one man to St.
George; he came back before July and said that many Muddy River
Indians would in two days come to St. George and that both bands
would then come together to Kanab. Then a man from St. George
(Pävuts) arrived at Kanab late in June; he came first in order to eat
rabbits with the Kanab people (not many rabbits around St. George;
in earlier days they used to hunt for rabbits around Mt. Trumbull); he
led in coyote and bird singing by way of preliminary in the evenings.
About July 5th or 6th, Frank Mustache went out very early to meet
the St. George and Muddy River Indians; he came back before noon
and reported that he had met them about nine at Pipe Spring (m""tiq' w
'mountain point running out into plain') and accompanied them for
some distance and that by noon they would be at the small town named
""Fredonia'"" 25 about 12 miles south of Kanab (called Ätsqav). Tom and
Joe started out immediately on Frank's report towards Fredonia, where
they met them, returned with them in the afternoon, led them to camp,
and went over to their own people. There were about 150 guests, of
whom about 85 were of St. George (only men and women, no children).
If they had not been met on the road by Tom and Joe, they would
naturally have been insulted at the slight. Then immediately upon arrival
(about 5 p.m. of July 7th), before putting up tents or even unhitching
horses, ""greeting"" took place at which 'wc""tsiS1 was leader (Tom Rice
and two girls served as assistants; this was the only time when Tony
noticed assistants at a Cry, but he had only witnessed one other). As
soon as they cried, they broke up, attended to the horses, and put up
tents. That evening they had bird singing with ""Broken Penis"" as leader
until midnight (nearly all bird songs and some roan songs were new
songs that were composed by Muddy River Indians, chiefly by one
certain man indefinitely referred to as Tant'ivwaiwiaYant"" 'western
singer'; some were entirely new, others were new versions of old songs;
coyote songs were almost all old ones). For about two nights after there
was no singing nor anything during the day. On the third day after
arriving all three bands proceeded northeast to East Fork. They camped
the first night at Skürumpä (English name;126 called in Paiute: Squrumpa £ ya' 'mouth of rabbit-bush canyon'; sqümp™ 'rabbit bush',
-tümpa'ya' 'mouth of canyon'), where there is a ranch. No singing was
done that evening. The next day they went on again and camped in a
canyon called Tc' ax qöarumpätc' 'Wild Geese Spring'. That evening they
sent two men — Paria John (Kanab Indian named Yin'ivwuts 'Bald
head'); the other man was an Arizona Paiute who lived with the KanabsKaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes839because of marriage with a Kanab woman, named Tivwik'y 'Dirty
Ground mixed with sticks clinging to brush' — on to East Fork to the
other camp (Cedar City, Arizona Paiutes, and Grass Valley Indians,
and some Shoshone from Western Utah; about 300 or more altogether).
They arrived on horseback in the middle of the night at East Fork,
where a round dance was being held; they informed them of the arrival
of the western bands; they returned the next day and met the Kanab
and two other bands at noon little more than halfway between ""Wild
Geese Spring"" and East Fork, accompanied by most of the Arizona
Paiutes (Mamputs had been at East Fork but had already left because
he got mad at something). All together now started off, the Arizona
Paiutes going on ahead. When two miles from East Fork camp, all of
the three first bands stopped and dressed; there they were met by
Pyravurav11 'Flour Arm' (not regularly sent but came on his own
account; he was a St. George Indian who had married a Kanab woman;
some Kanabs already had come to East Fork). They went on from
there and came in sight of the main camp about four or five o'clock.
The East Fork people already were in a line (row), also three other
bands advanced in flank motion. The latter got off and advanced to
within about 100 yards of the other line. (When about a half mile from
East Fork and already in flank form, old William circled around on his
horse and addressed them. Tony does not remember what was said. The
same flank movement and prepared line had been followed at Kanab.)
The second greeting took place under the leadership of 'w*'tsi"", who
sang a different song this time. The horses were unhitched and put out
to pasture, and camps erected; they started in to sing about 7 or 8 after
supper. There were three groups of singers — roan, bird, and coyote —
not disposed in any formal order. All three had rattles; there was no
difference in the form of the rattles. The three groups sang ahead
regardless of each other; they quit at about midnight. There is no regular
rule about singers; they can stop at any time or join one of the other
groups. No dancing was done during the singing.
The roan singers line up in two rows who face each other, the leader
being in the center of one of the rows. Part of the time they kneel, part
of the time they stand, according to the precedent set by the leader.
Bird singers always stand, also in two rows facing each other; they move
back and forth in flank formation somewhat in Bear Dance style, but
not with so lively a step; they gently shuffle along (feet slid forward
slightly alternately), at the same time slightly and gently bending or
swaying the body forward; the rattle in the right hand is gently moved840X SouthernPaiute and Uteobliquely down to right as it is held in front slightly to left, while the
palm of the left, elbow bent, is held out facing in and made gently to
follow the rattle movement by moving from up left to down right; the
rattle is allowed to touch the palm at each beat. Bird singers cover a
distance of about 30 to 40 feet. Coyote singers stand or kneel like roan
singers, with no characteristic motion (?). Mountain sheep always stand
but do not move, and never kneel. (Both Coyote and Mountain sheep
singers face each other in two rows.) They hold fists out with flexed
elbows and move them down parallel to each other. Mountain sheep
singers were had only the last night in 1901. Various groups of singers
not called ""coyotes"" or ""birds."" 127 Those not singing can do as they
please — talk, sit about a campfire. The singers are in the center of the
dance ground; the campflres were at the edge of the dance ground all
about (about eight of them). The camps were always put up in the
direction of the dance ground from which that particular party came;
the dance ground was a clear acre flat surrounded by big pines. Singing
was done during five nights, including the first on arrival. Nothing
much was done before noon; good times (Bear dances, Round dances,
foot races, horse races, wrestling, target shooting, card gambling) took
place on the third day after arrival; the Bear Dance was held twice; the
Round Dance on the second evening (when they had no cry singing);
foot races and target shooting were held on the fourth day; gambling
of course at any time. On the third, fourth, and fifth nights there was
""cry"" singing again; the same songs were sung, but not necessarily in
the same order. These last three nights the ""talker"" went about on the
dance ground and talked out loud to the people, reminding them of
their dead relatives and trying to make them sad. At the end of every
five roan songs, there is a slight pause during which an abbreviated cry
greeting takes place. All the people, also the non-roan-singers, join the
roan singers and make up two long lines who face each other. The
greeting leader comes in in the center, sings, and tells them to cry (no
hand-shaking or moving about); it was said that to cry after every four
songs would be too much of a strain on the people. Only during the
""cry"" part in the evening are there officers; there were two for Kanab
and one for each of the other bands. These were to see to it particularly
that no young couples went off sparking in the brush; in earlier days
they had no officers but complaints were made by the older Indians
about the loose conduct of the younger men, so they introduced officers
who had clubs or sticks, but did not generally need to use them. In the
last night, singing is kept up until dawn, when the burning has finished.","[838, 839, 840, 841, 842, 843, 844]"
"From the demonstrative stems o- and224X Southern Paiute and Ute
206SAPIRu- are formed the verbs of being: aro'a- το be (vis.) and uru'a- το
be (inv.). See § 56, 1.
(5) ai-, mai-. These are extended forms of demonstrative a- and
ma-. They are used as independent inanimate demonstrative pronouns, particularly with verbs of saying, (talking, hearing). However,
they are not ordinarily found except followed by pronominal enclitics.
Their objective forms are aia·, maia- (probably < a-ya-, ma-ya-).
As to usage, ai- is best translated as t h a t (indefinite), mai- as t h a t
(quoted, referred to).
Examples of subjective ai- are:
a'inl nayqa'q aip ini that-my heard (partic.)-my, that (is) what I
heard
a'i(y)aq-A qu'qo'qwikanayum aRi that-it (vis.) shoot (distributively)plural-verbal noun-your (plur.) it (vis.), that (is) it which you

Examples of objective aia- are:
a'ian 'a'imi
that (obj.)-I say- usitative, that's what I always say
a'ia y (fir 'a'imi' that (obj.)-he (vis.) indeed say-usitative, that's
what he indeed always says
'a'i 'iy'ir 'aik^A that (obj.)-thou indeed said, that indeed you said
(for 'ai < 'aia', see § 40, 2)
Curiously enough, objective aia- becomes ai- before the interrogative, the two elements combining as aitcu'a-, aintcu'a-, e. g.:
a'itcnan (or a'infcuan) a'ik ?A that (obj.)-interrogative-I said, did
I say that?
a'intcua r) 'a'imi' that (obj.)-interrogative-he (vis.) say-usitative, is
he wont to say that? does he really mean that?
Subjective mai- is illustrated in:
ma'in n\ni nar/qa'qaip'ini that (quoted)-my me heard (partic.)-my,
that's what I heard
mai'm imi nayqa'q ainA that-thy thee hearing, that's what you hear
Examples of objective maia- are:
ma'ian 'aik *A that I say
ma'i(y) 'iy'ir 'a'ik -Λ that indeed thou sayest (mai < maia' as above)
Parallel to maia- is m""a'ia-, e. g.:Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean Language

u w
m a'iAcampan niruyw ampa'xA that -(obj.)-only-me I-to talk, that
only talk to me! stop talking to me!
As we have already seen, aia- is also used as inanimate visible
objective article-pronoun: 'α'ΪΑ (§ 42, 7). Its parallel invisible 'oa'iA
(probably < u-a-ya-) is not used as independent demonstrative,
though it must be such in origin. For adverbial-connective use of
ai-, see § 60, 2, a; for 'οα'ΪΑ as modal adverb, see § 60, 3.
(6) VERBS OF SAYING. Parallel to the demonstratives ai- and radiäre the verbs of saying: ai- το SAY (indefinitely) and mai- (mwa'ia-)
u w
TO SAY THAT (which has been quoted); e. g. qatc m a' iar/wai' yucampA
NOT SAY-THAT-NEGATIVE-SUBORDINATING-ONLY,ALTHOUGH NOT SAY-ING THAT. Either these verbs result from composition with demonstrative α-, ma- (m w a'-); or they are merely verbified forms of demonstrative ai- and mat-.
Note on § § 39-43.
The three classes of pronouns already discussed observe the distinction in the third person between visible (or present) and invisible
(or absent) forms. Nevertheless sentences occur, as may have been
noticed, in which the same person or object is designated now as
visible, now as invisible. To a large extent this seems to be due to a
desire to prevent the same phonetic group (""word"") from containing
both a visible and an invisible element (see, for combinations of
two enclitics, § 41, 1, e), but not entirely. Apparently the difference
between the two sets of forms tends to become a formal rather than
a strictly functional matter. Examples of such contradictory
sentences are:
imi'ntcu'a-ijA pini'Rai'iijWA
tiyi'vw'ia'm u'IJWA thou-interrogativehim (vis.) see-him (inv.) friend-obj.-thy he (inv.; = him), did you

Interrogative stems may he divided into two groups, those employed
denominatively (interrogative pronouns proper) and those employedX Southern Paiute and Ute

accompanied by the interrogative enclitic -ru'a- (§ 19, 2, f).
( 1 ) D E N O M I N A T I V E FORMS.
Four or five denominative stems are
found: aya-, ini-, impi-, and αηια-; further ay a-, which is always
verbalized or adverbialized by suffixed elements.
(a) arja- WHO? This interrogative refers to persons only. Its
objective form is ayaia-; its subjective plural is ayami- (see § 48, 1),
objective ayam'ia-. I t must not be confused with αηα- H E , THAT
ONE (§ 39). I t is perhaps to avoid this confusion that interrogative
aya- is apparently never used with postpositions; e. g. aya'ruxwA
denotes το HIM, not το WHOM?. The latter idea would have to be
expressed periphrastically (see § 50, 8). Examples of αηα- are:ay aru""a who is? who is it?
ay aro""avi iyA who would-be this-one? I wonder who this is!
'ay an i'lc -A who does-so? who is it that does so?

aya'm'iantca' pAxqa'yu whom (plur.)- preterit-thou kill? whom (2)

(b) in i-' WHO? WHAT? OF WHAT SORT? This is a generalized
animate interrogative pronoun, referring to an animal, an animate
being not known to be definitely human or animal, or a person of
undefined characteristics. Subjective in-i- sometimes appears as
unelided ini before aro'a- το BE. Its objective singular is inia-·,
subjective plural in iyw'i- (see § 48, 1), objective iniyw'ia-.

impi- is connected with in i-·, for -pi- see nominalizing suffix -ρ-'i-, § 25,Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE2095, b? imp'i- may be used with at least certain postpositions (e. g. -m aWITH) ; it may also be used as a nominal base for verbal derivatives,
e. g. impi'yai- τ ο HAVE WHAT? impuru- τ ο MAKE WHAT? Examples
of imp'i- are:

(d) ania- WHAT? This interrogative is used only as the object
of verbs of saying or mental activity, e. g.:

ani'a' cy.via 'i' what-thou think-present? what are you thinking of?
Aside from its use as an interrogative pronoun, an ia- frequently
appears as a verb, ΤΟ SAY WHAT? AS such it is treated analogously to
ai- TO SAY. Examples are:

Rather different from these examples in inner, if not outer, form
are compounds in which the participle is freely used in a substantival
sense. They are really ordinary noun + noun compounds, in which
the logical emphasis is on the second element. Examples are:

is to be thought of as the object of the verb back of the participle.

being generally placed on the first element. Examples are:

"B y a glottalized vowel, e. g. d, is meant one that is articulated

correspond to what German writers on phonetics term ""Pressstimme.""

"Southern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE149Among the ideas expressed by aspect suffixes, those of momentaneousness and durativeness are the most important. Every verb
has a durative and a momentaneous form, the former being generally
the primary form of the verb, the latter expressed by internal consonant gemination, glottalization, reduplication, the suffixing of
certain elements, or a combination of these. The durative, as its
name implies, expresses continuous action, action conceived of as
lasting for an appreciable length of time (e. g. ΤΟ DRINK) ; the momentaneous conceives of the action as taking but a moment of time (e. g.
ΤΟ TAKE A DRINK) . Following are a few preliminary examples of the
distinction:
DURATIVEqova'qwi- to break
naya'va- to seem
mantcu'ywi-nato crush
yaya'- to cry
im!- to drink
qwatea'-ya- to splash about
iiyai- to take place
nontsi'- to
flyMOMENTANEOUSqo'po'qwinaya!p a -yurnantcu'q wi-n'nayaya'yato burst into tears
im'-jjuqwA'tca'-q i- to splash (once)
tTqa'rj'winontsi'-k-u-The various methods of forming the momentaneous exemplified
above are to be considered as more or less equivalent. No simple
rules can be given for all cases. One simply has to learn, e. g., that
such a form as *yaya'quplya* is not in use, but that yaya'xAp'iya
must be employed.
The aspects that may be recognized in Paiute are the durative,
the momentaneous, the inceptive, the iterative, the durative-iterative,
the resultative, the usitative, and the continuative. Moreover,
ideas that belong to the category of aspect are sometimes expressed
by means of compounded verb-stems or suffixes of motion (e. g. the
cessative by -maupa-, § 18, 2, a; the continuative or durative by
-qar'i- ΤΟ SIT, -q wa'ai- ΤΟ GO OFF, § 28, 2). A careful study of the
nuances of aspect formation can hardly be given here. We shall
simply list the various aspect suffixes with examples. For momentaneous (and inceptive) verbs formed by gemination or glottalization,
see § 53, 2; by reduplication, § 58, 5. For iteratives formed by reduplication, with or without accompanying gemination, glottalization,
or both, see § 58, 4.
(1) -ya-g durative of active intransitive (mediopassive) verbs.
By a mediopassive verb is meant one that expresses action withoutX Southern Paiute and Ute
150SAPIRdefinite agency, e. g. τ ο SHAKE (intr.), as contrasted with transitive
τ ο SHAKE and passive τ ο BE SHAKEN. Sometimes -ya- seems to be
used also with agentive active verbs. Examples of durative -ya- are:
riintci'yai
(it) shakes
piyo'xwai' (he) drags (it);
piyo'x Aqip'iya'aiywA
dragging (it)
yiu'xwai'
moves around
yu'mu'x(w)Ap'iya'
(he) moved
qwimpu'xwai'
(it) wiggles
si'yu'xwai'

T h e element -ya-g is very commonly employed in durative verbs
expressing a continuous sound of some sort, e. g.:
ampa'yato talk
po 'yux Apiyain i there was a sound as of something going through
(his) flesh (for -n ia- in these and other -ya- verbs, see § 19, 2, d).
fiijwa'vaya- to make a noise

smooth level surface
•pi'T)kixa(i)ytn i sounds like dripping water
si·' yaxani'iylni
makes a rustling noise (for -n i'i-, see 12 below)
T h e momentaneous correlate of this -ya- also is -q i- (or -rjqi-).
(2) -γΐ-, (-ijqi-) durative-iterative, chiefly of active intransitive,
sometimes transitive, verbs. I t is often transitivized by means of
-yfi- (§ 29, 10). I t differs from -ya- in conceiving of the action as not
strictly continuous, but broken up into a rapid series. I t differs from
the normal iterative (expressed by reduplication) in t h a t the repeated
acts cohere into a single durative unit. Examples are:
tarfwi'tciyc

mavi'tSLji
claps hands

laughs(3) - q i - momentaneous, chiefly of active intransitive and mediopassive verbs. Transitive forms in -q i-ηφ-.
Morphologically, -qiis the regular momentaneous correspondent of -yi-, formed from it by
gemination (§ 53, 2 b); it contrasts with both -ya- and -yi- forms.
Examples of its use are:
tA'pi'tcAqiTjqi'qwAto crush it by stepping on (it)

mina'qiMidway between properly momentaneous forms in -qi- and
durative forms in -ya- or -yi- are certain verbs in -q i- with nonmomentaneous form of stem, i. e. with ungeminated consonant.
These may be termed durative-momentaneous. Examples of durative-momentaneous versus momentaneous forms are:
qovo'q-WL-to break (intr.): qo'po'q wi- to break instantaneously
paya'q (a)i- to tear slowly (but in one tear): pA'qa'q i- to tearX Southern Paiute and Ute
152SAPIRIn such verbs -q-i- does not seem to alternate with -ya- and -yi-.
Verbs indicating a momentaneous sound also have a -q-i- suffix, e. g.:
kiffca'q in i
(it) makes a sound as of when something is thrust
through paper
sa'mu'qwiyini
makes a deep noise as when a stone is thrown into a
well
qi 'k in-L (it) sounds like one tear of a rag
v'cu'q-WL whistles
(4) -n a- durative transitive with singular object: -n'na- momentaneous transitive with singular object. See § 31, 2, b and c.
(5) -yu- n momentaneous. This is by far the most common momentaneous suffix. It follows most verb stems and is also employed
after many derivative and verbalizing suffixes. Examples are:
im- to drink
maain-i- to touch (duratively)
qvni- to take (one object)
maa-'vi'a- to be dressed
07iqa-' to be red
pa(i)yi- to return

tspiyup'Lya

a'ir/up'iya% spoke outIn particular cases -rju- n may take on an inceptive or cessative
significance, but its true force is never intrinsically inceptive or
cessative. Examples of these developments of the primary momentaneous idea are:
(a) toyoq-wi- to run
yaiyuii- to carry
m - to drinkcv-'yu-c-u-(to be) onetoyo'qwnjui'

momentaneous (or inceptive) activity that is just about to take
place (cf. the use of momentaneous forms in Russian to indicate the
future). The idea of imminent activity is still more explicitly
rendered by -quntsi-, compounded of -tju-n and diminutive -(ri)tsi(§ 35, 2). Thus, a form like trqa'quntsi- EAT-MOMENTANEOUS (INCEPTIVE)-LITTLE,TO B EA LITTLEOFF FROM BEGINNING TOEAT,easily comes to mean το BE ABOUT TO EAT. Examples of pre-inceptive
-r/untsi- are:

ya'uqwirjunUik-A

A'pi'iTfunts komi I am about to fall asleep, I am sleepy
(6) -ij'wi- momentaneous (intransitive). This suffix, which may
be related to -yu-n, occurs only in two or three verbs, its durative
correlative being a rarely occurring -i- or, in one case, -q a-. These
verbs are:
DURATIVEttyai- to take place
piyaito be left over
cuwaqato breatheMOMENTANEOUSt'i'qaij'wipiyay'wicuwarfwi-to take a long breath(7) -qu-, -jumomentaneous; inceptive. This element, like
-τμι-η, seems to be primarily momentaneous in significance and in a
number of verbs is used instead of -iju-"". Some verbs have both
-iju-"" and -q u- forms, generally with some idiomatic difference of
meaning. In many cases, moreover, -q u- is a properly inceptive
element, as in durative-inceptive -ya-q u-. What nuance of meaning
differentiates -q u- and -q u- is not clear. Presumably -q u- is more
definitely momentaneous in character (see § 53, 2, a, 3); as inceptive
it probably indicates a sharp moment of beginning.
Examples of momentaneous -q u- are:

Examples of usitative passive participial -η ϊηιρϊ- are:

I t may be pointed
out, however, t h a t -nimp'iyai- does not seem to occur after momentaneous -7/W-, which requires a following -m-i-. This may imply that the
-7U-"" usitative tends to have a more strictly durative character than
-m i-"", which in turn may have a momentaneous -iterative color.
(12) -n'ni-' (-ni'i-') continuative. This is a common durative
suffix that, with verbs of movement, shades into a significance not
very different from that of -m'mia- (§ 28, 4). I t seems best defined
as a continuative, equivalent in meaning to such English locutions as
το k e e p -ING, το be -Ing. It refers to an act consummated at one
period, not, like the usitative, to one which is repeated at intervals.
Examples are:

Another form of this suffix is -n i·-"" or, with preceding glottal stop,
-' . . .n-i·-'. These elements seem to differ from the more common
-n'ni-, partly in reinforcing the idea of plurality or distribution of
the subject, partly in conveying a usitative implication. The matter

Ethnographic Field Notes
Edited by Catherine S. Fowler and Robert C. Euler
The two works in this section contain the bulk of the ethnographic notes
made by Edward Sapir in conjunction with his Southern Paiute and Ute
linguistic work in 1909 and 1910. In August and September, 1909, Sapir
— then newly appointed Instructor in Anthropology at the University of
Pennsylvania — conducted linguistic field work among the Ute of Utah
under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. In the
company of graduate student J. Alden Mason, he visited the Uintah-Ouray
Reservation, where he worked for a short time on Uncompahgre Ute at
Fort Duchesne; he then went on to Whiterocks, where he worked on the
Uintah dialect. While at Whiterocks, his principal consultant was Charlie
Mack, from whom he recorded seven Uintah tales (published in Sapir
1930e, this volume). Upon his return, Sapir published a brief note on some
phonetic and grammatical aspects of Ute (Sapir 1910c).
In January, 1910, Sapir went to Carlisle Indian School, south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to look for a Ute speaker among the students. There
he met Tony Tillohash, a young speaker of Kaibab Southern Paiute, which
Sapir suspected to be linguistically close to Ute. Tillohash had been at
Carlisle for about five years and was just finishing his course of study.
With the help of the school superintendent and the director of the University Museum, Sapir arranged for Tillohash to come to Philadelphia.
From February through May, 1910, Tillohash worked as a janitorial assistant at the museum as well as with Sapir. He served as consultant for a
seminar on American Indian languages which Sapir was offering, and in
which Mason was a student (Mason to Euler, May 22, 1956). Through
the intensive work during this four-month period, Sapir was able to record
sufficient data from Tillohash for a full treatment of Kaibab Southern
Paiute, including a grammar, texts, and a dictionary (Sapir 1930d, 1930e,
1931k, this volume). He also produced a 106-page manuscript of notes on
Kaibab ethnography, and recorded the texts and music of some 200
Southern Paiute songs. These data, which far eclipsed those he had obtained on Ute, would be used by Sapir in additional works in historical,780X Southern Paiute and Utecomparative, and theoretical linguistics (Sapir 1913f, 1933c; see the introduction to this volume), and in the preliminary description of Southern
Paiute musical forms (Sapir 191 Od). The friendship that developed among
Tillohash, Sapir, and Mason was genuine and rewarding.
Following the work in Philadelphia, Tillohash returned home to Kaibab, Arizona, and after a few years moved to the Shivwits Southern Paiute
Reservation in southwestern Utah, where he married and spent most of
the rest of his life. He and his wife Bessie raised a large family; Tillohash
worked primarily as a ranch hand. He served as Shivwits tribal chairman
for many years, from the mid-1930s until the 1960s. He retained an active
intellectual interest in his culture, serving as an interpreter for ethnographers including Isabel Kelly, Philip Drucker, and Omer Stewart during
the 1930s and 1940s, and as an ethnographic consultant for Robert Euler
in the 1950s and for Catherine Fowler in the 1960s (Fowler and Fowler
1986).
The ethnographic manuscripts edited for this publication have rather
complex histories. As noted above, the Kaibab manuscript is essentially
a single document, undoubtedly written over the four-month period of
the Tillohash-Sapir collaboration. Since the notes were made at least in
part during linguistic elicitation, the original manuscript follows no
particular or logical order. Rather, it covers each isolated topic in one
or several paragraphs of notes, separated from the next topic or set by
a penned line; occasionally, as with the Kaibab names for springs, the
material is from a specific elicitation. At some unknown date, probably
before 1930, Sapir had a typescript made from this manuscript, to which
he added a few miscellaneous ethnographic notes gleaned from his
Kaibab linguistic notebooks. Then, perhaps in preparation for publication, Sapir cut up a copy of the typescript and clipped together the
sections related to each topic, giving each a tentative title.
The Ute manuscript has a slightly different but related history. During
his 1909 field trip to Ute country, Sapir kept his linguistic and ethnographic
notes in the same notebooks. As the purpose of his trip was primarily
linguistic, much of what he obtained of ethnographic significance was
written as brief comments or marginal notes to lexical or textual material.
While transcribing texts, Sapir wrote on the right-hand sheets of his notebooks only, using the left-hand sheets for footnotes and other comments.
It is thus on the left-hand pages that most of the Ute ethnographic notes
appear. (Exceptions to this are longer sections, such as Sapir's and Mason's
direct observations of facial painting designs at dances, notes on tipi construction, and a few other topics.) Thus, even more than in the case of theKaibab Paiute and Northern Ute Ethnographic Field Notes781Kaibab notes, the Ute notes follow no plan of elicitation and are unsystematic and incomplete. Again, at a later date Sapir had a typescript made
from these notes, apparently instructing the typist to excerpt any comment
lined to the side in the notebooks, in the order in which they appeared.
Sapir then cut up a copy of this typescript, arranged the sections by topic,
titled each section, and clipped the notes together. Sometimes sections are
attributed to specific consultants (Charlie Mack or John Duncan, Uintah;
Herbert Ariv, Uncompahgre); sometimes not.
Apparently, not long before Sapir's death, 1 he gave these various
Southern Paiute and Ute ethnographic manuscripts (as well as other
unpublished manuscripts with ethnographic content) to Leslie Spier in
the hope that they would someday be published. Toward that end, Spier
gave a copy of the Ute typescript (along with some photographs by
Sapir and Mason) to Anne Cooke Smith, who had written her master's
thesis on Northern Ute material culture (Cooke 1937) and was in the
process of editing the thesis for general publication. Before giving the
material to Spier, Sapir apparently had also given a copy of the cut-up
version of the Kaibab notes to Isabel Kelly, a graduate student at the
University of California, Berkeley, who during 1932 and 1933 did
intensive field work among all the Southern Paiute groups under the
direction of Alfred L. Kroeber. Kelly employed Tony Tillohash as an
interpreter for her work among the Shivwits Southern Paiute. For some
reason, Sapir recalled the copy in Kelly's possession, with the promise
that she could have it again when she began to write up her data for
publication (Spier to Euler, May 22, 1956; Spier to Euler, June 26, 1956;
Spier to Jean Sapir, April 26, 1939). This version apparently came into
the hands of David Mandelbaum at the University of California, Berkeley, during his work of compiling selected published and unpublished
works of Sapir for publication (Mandelbaum 1949).
In 1956, Robert Euler was at the University of California, Berkeley,
working on Southern Paiute ethnohistory in preparation for hearings
before the Indian Claims Commission. He saw the manuscript in Mandelbaum's possession and was directed by Mandelbaum to Leslie Spier
for further information. Euler obtained copies of the cut-up versions of
1. In a letter to Jean Sapir, dated April 26, 1939, Spier outlines the manuscripts of
Sapir's then in Spier's possession. This letter, following within two months of Sapir's
death, seems to indicate that these materials were transferred before his death by
Sapir himself, rather than afterward by his widow. The same supposition is made
with reference to the materials given to Herzog (see below).","[766, 767, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776, 777, 778, 779, 780, 781, 782, 783, 784, 785]"

"Bull-Roarer
The bull-roarer was often used by children in play to make a wind.
The old folks, however, would not like it sometimes and would take it
away and burn it up. The reason is that the buzz calls the evil spirits
('inipits).166Miscellaneous Customs 1 6 7
This was the old Indian custom in greeting: to grasp each other's
hands, but not necessarily shake; called tiyfvwutcaEai'.
Greeting is maik"" or mäikywäc"".168 On the coming of a man from
another tribe, nearly everybody gathers around to hear the news; after
a while he tells what he has to say: if he has nothing to say, he simply
says he is going around just for fun. There is no salutation corresponding
to ""good-bye.""
Still the Paiutes had no sign-language.
If one sneezed, it meant that someone was speaking of him.
The following joke was sometimes indulged in: If a stranger with his
bow came along, one of the home fellows might take his bow and slip
it along on the ground on the broad outer side of the bow. If it fell862X Southern Paiute and Uteresting with the string toward the stranger, it showed that his penis had
been ""skinned.""
If rats were troublesome in the house, a man would station himself
near a rat-hole and call the rats by squealing with tightly pressed lips.
He was ready to shoot the rat as it appeared with bow and arrow.
Bull-roarers were whirred in order to cause the wind to blow.169863Kaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes

"Southern Paiute DictionaryPREFACE.
The following dictionary of Southern Paiute is based on the Paiute
texts which form the second part of this volume and on the grammatical and lexical notes which were secured from Tony Tillohash at
the same time as the texts. I t is in no sense a complete dictionary
of the language but necessarily includes only such material as I
happened to record. The entries and the examples which follow
must always be understood in the light of a knowledge of the fundamental Paiute sounds and their changes. In other words, the
dictionary presupposes Part I, for it would be impracticable to give
chapter and verse for each phonetic rule that is illustrated in the
examples.
The purpose of the dictionary is twofold: to assist the student in
the analysis of the texts; and to provide the future student of comparative Shoshonean with the lexical materials that he will need.
No attempt has been made to heap examples, which in most instances
would add nothing that is not already evident from the entries
themselves and the phonology and morphology of Paiute as described
in Part I. On the other hand, distinctive derivatives of stems and
compounds are given where available. Cross-references to the texts,
indicated by page and line numbers, are given sparingly and with
attention to their value for the student.
The dictionary includes all noun and verb (including adjective)
stems, pronouns, adverbs, and interjections recorded. Of the elements
which cannot occur unless preceded or followed by other elements it
includes noun and verb stems which occur only as second elements in
compounds, enclitics (including pronominal enclitics), postpositions, and
prefixes. I t does not include as independent entries the derivational
and relational suffixes described and illustrated in the grammar.
If an entry, such as an enclitic or postposition, is treated in the

"Bear Danceu4
In 1901 they had a bear-dance in the afternoon (5 to 6) about that time,
not as an important dance, but as a pleasure dance, just as they had foot
and horse races, wrestling, target-shooting. There is no particular leader
to a bear dance. About eight men sit down on the ground in a circle around
a dishpan (formerly a round basket) and play rasps which lie on the pan
nearly flat (only tilted to a slight angle), singing at the same time. The
singing starts in first as a sort of signal for the beginning of the dance.
Whoever wishes joins in; others may look on. The women gather on the
side away from the singers; the men are near the singers. The girls and
women advance towards the singers on the flat stomped-out dancing
ground in no regular line, and without keeping time to the music; then
each singles out a partner from the men by touching with a branch or
throwing a pebble. The woman then advances backwards followed at a
distance by the man she had picked out in time to the music; they may
thus advance and come back several times before joining in together. The
dancing parties do not keep in line, but each advances and steps back
regardless of the others. After a while (or immediately), they join, each
holding the right hand on the other's left shoulder and left hand behind
the waist. There seems to be no attempt to have the step (a sort of light
springy walk or semi-hop) keep in time to the singing and rasping; some
go fast, others slow. A song generally lasts from five to ten minutes. AfterKaibab Paiute EthnographicField Notes849a very short interval, the next is started; other parties now dance or the
same may dance again. The girls are supposed to represent the bears, the
men are the persons who dance with the bear women, according to the
myth. If one does not wish to follow the girl he is poked with a pole or
branch carried by one of the two or three officers (who may have appointed
themselves so or been agreed upon as such by the men, not the women)
and forced to follow. If one is not alert in following, it is believed that
when chased by a bear in the mountains, he will not get away easily;
otherwise he would. Many songs are sung. The last song is the longest,
lasting from about twenty to thirty minutes, and is called ""moving the
longest distance"" (miyotox mi4i')· If one of the members of a party gives
out, his or her place is taken immediately by a friend, a large number of
whom are ready. Both boy (man) and girl (woman) must not stop dancing
at the same time; the party as such must continue throughout. It generally
ends about sundown.
When Tony was about eight or nine, the Kaibabs returned from hunting
on the Kaibab Plateau to Kanab in the fall and were instructed in it by
Tom (then a young man of Cedar City Indians, who had been much with
the Utes; he now lives with the Kaibabs and is considered the best singer
of bear-dance songs, being generally the song-leader) and medicine-man
Mamputs of the Arizona Paiutes, who had traveled much among the
Southern Utes. Tom ordered six holes to be dug in a distance of about 20
feet and had cedar posts (about 10 feet high) erected; no explanation was
given of this fence and it has never been used since. Mamputs sang first
as leader, chiefly songs with words; then Tom followed, mostly with songs
without words, which are considered more difficult. One of his songs long
after, maybe composed by himself, is: ""Let us go back home, my friend,
we are traveling about just for fun."" Nowadays the bear dance is generally
sung in March, but sometimes also during the summer, whenever there is
a general gathering or ""good time.""
The Bear Dance takes place every spring, generally early in March. Two
lines are formed, one of men and one of women; the dance consists in the
moving of the two lines towards each other, stopping, then moving back,
and so on repeatedly. Six or eight men are used as singers of the Bear
Dance songs. These songs have Paiute words and seem to follow in a
certain order, each song consisting of a statement or of a question and
answer referring to some incident in the myth recounting the origin of the
Bear Dance. There must be several hundred of these songs; according to
Tony Tillohash, old men acquainted with all the songs would be able to
sing from nightfall to morning without duplicating songs. The singers in850X SouthernPaiute andUtethe dance accompany themselves with rasps, rubbing cylindrical pieces of
wood over long, somewhat oblong sticks serrated on one side with angular
notches. Different sized rasps could be used. To secure a sounding board,
a small pit is dug in the ground and a basket placed over it. The rasps rest
on this by an edge obliquely cut away at one end of the side opposite the
notches. The ceremony lasts four days.
In the Bear Dance, three officers are appointed with long pointed
sticks. If a man touched by a willow branch held by a girl refuses to
dance, he will not escape when chased by a grizzly bear. The dance is
supposed to give a person the power to escape from bears. The dance
consists in running back and forth, man with woman partner.
In the Bear Dance a man and woman faced each other with one hand
on the other's shoulder and the other hands clasped.145 The pair ran up
and down keeping together in this position.
The Bear Dance is important enough in itself to make different bands
come around to witness; generally it is held at the place where a
particular band camps. The Kaibabs have it every March when bears
come out of their dens; also the Arizona Paiutes have it; the Muddies
and St. Georges have seen it but do not perform it, not having good
bear-dance singers.146Rasps Used in the Bear Dance
Mampüts generally rasps one direction, towards himself, two beats
to each bar. Tom generally rasps four times to a bar, alternately towards
and away from himself, the main beat coming on the rasp beat towards
himself, with which he begins.
Before beginning to sing, it is customary to have one bar of rasping
(two ""towards"" beats with M., four beats with Tom); sometimes only
a bar is rasped. At the end of a song the rasp is played with four (or
five) rapid (twice as quick as before) strokes, the last being outward
and most accented. Raspers may follow either of two styles; they do
not all have to rasp in the same way.
uvwu tivun'
qamusaywÄyätsiYv Ant""
Alas (pity)! my friend having a jack-rabbit stomach!
These words are said when any one of the dancers falls down or
stumbles. One of the raspers, seeing him or her do so, jumps up andKaibab Paiute Ethnographic Field Notes851quickly runs there, while rapidly rasping, and puts the rasp on his or
her back, keeping on rasping quickly.
The sound of the rasp can be heard as much as two or three miles
away on a quiet evening, the rasping carrying farther than the singing.
Each tries to sing as loud as he can; this is not true of cry songs. At
the end of a song, the rasps are held in the hand with the sticks; at the
end of the dance, the pan is put away where it belongs and the rasps
and sticks are put in the hole. The rasps are thrown away after the
ceremony.","[852, 853, 854, 855]"
"Southern Paiute, a Shoshonean229LanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE211§ 45. The relative pronoun.
The Paiute relative pronoun, pi-, can be used only with postpositions; e. g. pima- WITH WHICH, pu'urai- WHERETO, WHITHER,
pivwa- IN WHICH, WHERE. The equivalent of our own subjective and
objective relative clauses is afforded by participles and verbal nouns
in -na- (§ 25, 3). Properly speaking, pi- is a noun, as is shown by
the fact that it is frequently followed by an inanimate article-pronoun.
The verb following the relative is generally in the form of a verbal
noun in -n a-, less frequently in the form of a participle in -p i- (§
25, 5, b), rarely a non-participial absolute; hence the logical subject
of a relative clause is always objective (i. e. possessive) in form. A
sentence like THIS IS THE STICK THAT I HIT HIM WITH is rendered by
THIS IS THE STICK WITH WHICH (IS) MY HITTING (OR HAVING HIT) HIM.","[228, 229]"

not i'm 'iyiR, but imi'tyiR (in general, -i- iyiR becomes iyiR); -ay
iyiR often coalesces to -ay g'iR (stopped g is sometimes heard for

preterital significance with iyiR. Examples are:

irrealis forms (§ 33, 1), particularly such as indicate unfulfilled

"§ 47. Noun and verb stem.
All Paiute stems end in a vowel or diphthong. A peculiarity of the
great majority of noun and verb stems is that they are primarily
disyllabic, e. g. qan iHOUSE;
fivwi-a EARTH; αΙ α-° SAND; ραγ(«){-"" τ ο
GO; qari-"" ΤΟ SIT; paq a-° ΤΟ KILL. The typical monosyllabic stem (or
radical) of so many languages is conspicuous by its comparative
infrequency; moreover, practically all monosyllabic stems have two
moras, e. g. qa -' ΤΟ SING, pai-"" ΤΟ CALL to -"" BLACK, O - S ARROW, pen-""
BLOOD. If expressed in terms of moras, the typical Paiute stem
would probably be found to have two moras, i. e. to consist of a
monosyllable with a long vowel or diphthong, or, far more frequently,
of two short-voweled syllables. However, disyllabic stems of three
moras (e. g. tu-γυ•- ΤΟ CACHE, Una - BOTTOM) are not at all rare.
Trisyllabic stems, of three or more moras (e. g. as ia - SURFACE,
tayoq wi- ΤΟ RUN), are also fairly common; stems of four or moreSouthern Paiute, a ShoshoneanLanguageSOUTHERN PAIUTE, A SHOSHONEAN LANGUAGE213syllables are rare (e. g. ttvwitsiya- ΤΟ OBEY). Were extended comparative Uto-Aztekan material available, it would no doubt be
possible to show that many of these trisyllabic and tetrasyllable
stems are capable of analysis. The two-moraed stem ending in a
vowel, of both monosyllabic and disyllabic structure, is clearly the
characteristic type of stem for all Uto-Aztekan languages.
Noun and verb stems are kept clearly distinct, the use of the same
stem now as noun, now as verb, being exceedingly uncommon. An
example is quq wa- WOOD, also ΤΟ GATHER WOOD (cf. English BERRY
and ΤΟ BERRY); note also ni(y)a- (two-moraed) ΤΟ CALL BY NAME,
but ni{y)a•- (three-moraed) NAME (it is quite possible, however, that
niya- really consists of niya- + possessive -α-, § 24, 2, a so t h a t niyawould be another example of a stem capable of being used either as
noun or verb).
From a strictly formal standpoint, noun and verb are, as we have
seen, carefully distinguished, there being very few grammatical
elements which are appended to both types of stem (e. g. diminutive
-tsi-, § 35; plural -q a-, § 31, 1, c and § 48, 2). However, there is a
slight tendency for verbs to be nominalized, without nominalizing
suffix, by means of nominal postpositions, but forms of this sort are
far from common (e. g. p'ivwa wim'jf aip a ntux wA WHICH-IN STANDPERFECTIVE-TO, TO WHERE ( H E ) HAD STOOD) ; see § 55,2. The clearest
syntactic indication of a feeling for nominal form is the presence of
article-pronouns (§42).
§ 48. Plurality of nouns.
There are two types of noun plurals: the reduplicated form, which
is more properly distributive in function, for both animate and
inanimate nouns (see § 58, 2 for these forms); and properly plural
suffixes, which can, for the most part, be appended only to noun
stems referring to animate beings (cf. the presence of singular and
plural animate forms and the lack of distinctively plural inanimate
forms in the third personal pronouns).
(1) ANIMATE PLURAL SUFFIXES. Two animate plural suffixes
exist, -ijw'i-' and -mi-', with exactly parallel functions and differentiated merely according to the preceding stem. These elements
apply to duals also, -r/w'i- is evidently spirantized from an older
-mi- (§16, 1); -mi- is the corresponding geminated (and nasalized)
form. Their Uto-Aztekan prototype *-me actually occurs as an
animate plural in Nahuatl {-mi).
In actual practice it seems hardlyX Southern Paiute and Ute
214SAPIRfeasible to assign -yw'i- to spirantizing stems alone, -m-'i- definitely
to all geminating (and nasalizing) stems, as their range of usage
seems to intercross with that of types of stem; thus, nominal -tsi-n
(§ 24, 1, f) forms plural -tsiyw'C-, while participial -ti-n (§ 25, 6) forms
-tim 'i-. No simple rules can therefore be given for the use of -yw'ior -ιιι ϊ-.
(a) -mi- (subjective); -m-ϊα- (objective). Examples are:
naya'mi
mountain sheep (sing. na'x A)
qA'qa'rami
quails (sing. qAzqa'w)
tciya'mi
ducks (sing. ici'x-A)
a(i)ya'm'i
turtles (sing. α'ΪΑ)
wTtca'mi
roadrunners (sing. wi't cA)
a'ivam iratjWA our (inclus.) young men (sing. a'i<t>Apits· young man)
yu'tami
Utes (sing, yu-'t-a-ts··, plur. also yu 't a tsajw'i)
In the last two examples a nominalizing suffix of the singular
(-ρ-'ttsi-, -isi-) has been dropped before the plural suffix. This is not
common; but cf., further, sari't'i'qami
ARAPAHO I N D I A N S (lit.
DOG-EAT-PLURAL, noun-verb compound noun; sing. sari 't Tqats ).
Animate plural -m 'i- is also appended to cardinal -yu- of numerals
for TWO and above, when used attributively with enclitic -n ta-,
before animate nouns, e. g.:
waa!(i)yumuni
wi'tsi'tsiywiarjA
two-cardinal-animate plur.-like
great-grandchildren-plural-her (vis.), her two great-grandchildren.
(b) -ijw'i- (subjective); -Tjwia-, rjwa(·)- (objective). The objective
in -rjwa{·)- is very common; it is merely a phonetic variant of -tjwia(see §4, 1, a). Examples of subjective -r/w'i- are:
nava'virjwi
reciprocal-elder brother-plural, two brothers
pavi'm my elder brother)
paa'yw'i aunts; paa'rjwini my aunts (sing, paa'ni my aunt)
qava 'ijw'i horses (sing, qava"")
