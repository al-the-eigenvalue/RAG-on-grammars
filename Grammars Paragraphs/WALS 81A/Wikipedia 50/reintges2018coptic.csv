7 ae’ concluding chapter of this grammar (UNIT 12) is
concerned with
nite anc non-finite subordinate clauses, which function as
dependent
constituents within some larger construction. A major
division of
subordinate clauses concerns the opposition between argum
ent clauses
that belong to the core of the matrix verb phrase, and
adjunct clauses
that belong to its periphery. Of particular relevance are
topics like
:
’ clausal coherence and switch reference (i.e.
the contrast between same: Subject and different-subject clauses), sequences of tenses,
and indirect
speech-acts (reported speech, indirect questions and comma
nds)
“Sounds and spellingcaneNn,‘This Unit addresses two interrelated topics: one concerns the CoptoGreek alphabet, i.e. the notation system in which Coptic texts have
‘been codified, and the other concems its sound system, or phonology.
‘Section 1.1 discusses the main aspects of Coptic orthography, while
‘section 1.2 presents several types of evidence for the pronunciation of a
4particular letter or gtapheme. There is not always a one-to-one
correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, since some
‘phonemes may be expressed by more than one grapheme and, vice
‘versa, some graphemes may have more than one phonological
‘interpretation, Section 1.3 is about suprasegmental phonology, i.e. the
‘phonological structure beyond the individual sounds or phonemes, with
particular attention for vowel length, syllable structure, and stress
-|placement.
. Section 1.4 addresses the question of language contact and linguistic
borrowing. The Coptic word stock has a considerable Greek
{jcomponent. The transfer of Greek lexical material was not confined to
{content words, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, but also mvolved a
‘tconsiderable amount of function words, such as sentence conjunctions,discourse markers, mannerand time adverbials,and evensomeprepositions. The variant spelling of Copto-Greek loan words not only
reflects ongoing sound changes in the source language Koine Greek,
but also the absence of certain phonological oppositions in the
borrowing language Coptic Egyptian.","[17, 18]"

verb. The
most common verbs that trigger residual V-S—O order
are listed intable 10.2 below. In such remnant V—S-O
constructions, the
postpositioning of the subject is not due to some reorde
ring operation,since postverbalsubjects maybe left dislocated and inverted fortopicalisation and focalisation purposes. The releva

Even TAM markers that lack the allomorphic opposition betwee
n long
and short forms show a consistent syntactic behaviour in that
they do not
allow prosodically weak function words to disrupt
the syntactic
continuity between the clause-initial TAM marker and
the adjacent
subject. For this reason, enclitic particles and function words
like Ae and
ON ‘also, too’ appear m clause-third position, following both
the TAM
expression and the subject nominal, ¢:g. a Teqcwne Ae wa

different
situation obtains with pronominal subjects, which form
a prosodic unit
with the verbal stem. Enclitic function words are therefor
e placed in
postverbal position, e.g. aytamio Ae NOyYTaIBe NgaT

Section 7.1.2 reviews the internal composition of various conjugation...
patierns, with particular attention for the relative order of the TAM
marker with respect to the subject and the main verb.
7.1.1 The proclitic behaviour of TAM markers
Coptic TAM markers are inflection words, which are morphologicallyindependent of the verb. They appear in two syntactic positions, one
preceding the.subject.and another following the subject and preceding
mai
preverbal TAM markers have invariant forms, while pre-subject TAM
markers may have different forms or allomorphs, depending on whether a
nominal or pronominal subject follows. The Habitual Present, for

10.1.5.4 Free inversion
In Coptic, subject inversion is a reordering operation that applies freely
to various classes of transitive and intransitive verbs (see section 6.2 of
Unit 6 for a survey of lexical classes of verbs). Depending on the
lexical semantics of the verbal predicate, subject-inverted clauses
receive Special interpretations.a)Transitive verb constructionsSubject-inverted V-O-S sentences can only be used in contexts in
which the referent of the direct object is more topical than that of thesubject. They frequently involve a contrast between a nominal subject' that corresponds to discourse-new information and a pronominal object
_ that conveys discourse-given information, e.g. Nrepeqxe Nal AE NOI
_Tarreaoc (...) ‘when the angel (n-arreaoc) had said (nrepe-xe)

10.1.2.2 Dative shift
In the absolute state, there is a single instance of “scrambling”, whichcauses the direct and the indirect object to switch position with respect
to the verb. Scrambling takes place when the prepositional object
(PPpo) of the absolute state verb is a full noun phrase and the indirect
object a dative clitic (DAT-CL). The “scambled” order of dative shift
constructions is Vas > DAT-CL > PPpo order, e.g. aqt Nac Noyp!
2ITOY@q MMpHC NTeKKAHCIA ‘he (Apa Pambé) gave (a-q-t) her

Adverbial modifiers, by contrast, can never be moved in front of the
direct or indirect object, e.g. aqnarexe NNECNHY 2aATHQ WOMNT
NEBOT ETRE Teqweepe ‘he (the king) kept (a-q-Katexe) the
brothers (N-Ne-cnny) with him (garn-q) (for) three (womnt) months

Left-dislocation belongs ‘to a broad family of informationpackaging constructions. These pragmaticaily marked sentenc
e
patterns differ: from their unmarked counterparts not in proposi
tional
content or illocutionary meaning (declarative, interro gative, imperat
ive
etc.), but rather in the way the information is presented. In Coptic, the
difference between information-packing constructions and their more
-basic counterparts is in most cases simply a matter of linear
order of
the main sentence constituents, in particular, the subject. Thus, in leftdislocated sentences a noun phrase or its equivalent is placed in the
left
periphery of the clause with an anaphorically linked pronoun within
that clause. They serve as a syntactic means of indicating that
a
particular nominal constituent denotes the to pic of the sentence.
The
notion of “topichood” is a relational category: since the topic
corresponds to information that is given or available from
the
preceding discourse, it must evidently be part of the presup
posed
portion of the clause.",[154]

11.3.1.3 The cleft constituent as a pivot
The relation between the cleft constituent and the embedded relative
clause is one of identification: the relative clause contains an openposition or “variable” (either realized as a gap or as a resumptive
pronoun) for which the clefted noun or pronoun provides an
appropriate value. The clefted noun phrase therefore fulfils two
grammatical functions simultaneously. It is the subject of a tripartite
nominal sentence, but at the same time it is the antecedent noun of the
embedded relative clause. As a relative antecedent, it may have aninlernal subject, object, or adverbial role.

Bipartite nominal sentences display two fundamentally different wordorder patterns that can be directly related to the prosodic status of the-subject pronoun chosen. First and second person pronounsappear insubject-initial clauses, whereas third person pronouns occur in predicatefirst sentences in which the predicate noun is placed in front of the
pronominal subject. The factor motivating this word order contrast is the
prosodic behaviour of the subject pronoun in question. Thus, proclitic
pronouns are phonologically attached to the right of the host word, which
is the nominal predicate, and the result is subject-first order. Enclitic
pronouns, on the other hand, must follow their phonological host, which
_ gives rise to predicate-first order. Thus, compare: anr oyp@ne NTEKZE
‘I (anr) (am) a man of your kind’ (V. Pach. 89:27) vs. oypwne Ne NTE
nnoyTe ‘he (ne) (is) a man (oy-pwne) of (NTE) God (n-NoyTte)’ (AP,
Chaine no. 243, 75:18-19), anr_oytiNa ‘J (anr) (am) a ghost (oy-T1iNX)’
(Onnophr. 206:19) vs. Taxa oyiiNa me ‘perhaps (raga) he (re) (is) a
ghost (oy-fiNa)’ (AP, Chaine no. 243, 75:7)_
5.1.2.1 Clitic clustering
only on opposite sites of
not
Proclitic and enclitic pronouns appear
their phonological host, the nominal predicate, but ~also exhibit
different degrees of prosodic boundness. The proclitic first and second
person pronouns form a single, indivisible prosodic constituent with
the adjacent nominal predicate. It is therefore not possible for enclitic ~..
eleinents to split up the subject-predicate complex. As a result,
prosodically weak function words, such as the Greek discourse
markers Ac and rap ‘since’, the additive focus particle on ‘also, too”
or the negative adverb an ‘not’ must appear in clause-third position, to
the left of the predicate nominal, e.g. anr oymaTos Men ‘J (anr) (am)
a soldiér (oy-maroi)’ (Mena, Enc, 50b:9-10), ewxe NTE OyMaay AE

(anr) (am) not (an) a man (N-pwre) of your kind (Oy-KaTApw-TN)’
(Sh. I 117:5). The postponement of enclitic function words and

where third person pronouns compete with enclitic function words anc
particles for the clause-second position. As a rule, enclitic third persor
pronouns are placed in clause-third position, to the left of the enclitic
particle, €.2. OYEAAXICTON MEN TIE NNAgpN Npwme ‘he (ne) (is

strategies of objective case assigument (i.e. the case associated with
the direct object argument of a transitive verb). In the construct state, accusative case is assigned purely on the basis of the structural
configuration in which the direct object argument appears, namely in
the complement position of the verb. For this reason, the assignment of

10.1.5Subject inversionSubject inversion is an information-packaging construction used
when the nominal subject is in focus. The focalised subject lmearly
follows the verb and the direct object, yielding the non-canonical order
V-O —-S. The informational status of the inverted subject is registered
by a dedicated focus particle Noi. To disambiguate the relational role of
the postverbal constituent, subject inversion is always accompanied byinserting a pronominal placeholder in the preverbal subject slot.
Subject-inverted sentences like nrepeqxe NaI Ae NOt rMarreaoc

conjugation patterns for present, past and future tenses. More fine-grained
temporal distinctions are made in the domain of past and future timereference. In the past, the presence of a secondary deictic centre furnishes
a triplet of Preterit tenses, to wit the Preterit Present,the Preterit Past(Pluperfect), and the Preterit Future. Moreover, there are two distinctivefuture tenses that ascribe different degrees of likelihood or necessity to a
forthcoming situation.
Besides absolute tenses, Sahidic Coptic has an extensive set of relative
tenses and moods. Relative tenses derive their name from the fact that they
locate some event with respect to another event rather than a fixedtemporal reference point. In this way, they serve similar functions as
temporal connectives like afier, when and until in English. Section 8.1
examines how these subordinate tense forms establish the relative order ofevents. The focus of section 8.2 is on the Coptic modal system. Mood is a
grammatical category through which the speakers of a languagecommunicatetheirattitudeorbeliefsconcerningthelikelihood,desirability, or necessity for some situation to occur. Within the sameformal system, Coptic has not only an Imperative, but also a formally
distinct Jussive, Conditional, and Inferential mood.",[209]
"Adverbial modifiersAdverbial phrases are sentence modifiers that bear a close semantic
relation to the verb and its arguments (subject, object). Adverb modifiers
contributeto the semantic interpretation of the clause they modify byshall eat (uNe ... oym) anything (NKa) inside his cell (N2g0YN N-TE-PI)
(praec. Pach. 114).providing information about
the temporal and spatial setting of some state
of affairs or about the circumstances
under which it took place. Coptic has
no specialized derivational morphology
‘to create adverbial expressions
from nouns and adjectives. Rather, adverbial adjuncts are either derived3.from prepositional phrases or involve adverbially used noun phrases.",[69]
"OBJECT""Although preposed adverbials are not natural discourse topics that can
be paraphrased as “as for”, they may assume a topic function when
Just like left-they have been introduced in the preceding sentence.dislocated nouns and pronouns, such discourse-linked adverbs mayassume a contrastive or emphatic reading, e.g. com HEN wayoywe
GXM TIEBIW EYWANONTY Com AE wayoyw2 ExM TIOEIK ‘some time(con nen) they (flies) will sit (ma-y-oywz) on (exn) honey (11-ex1w),

sixty (ce) years (N-porme) I have been living (t-woor) in (gn) this
desert (1i-eprria)’ (Onnophr. 210:18-19).
Anaphorically used time and reason adverbials like unncwe ‘after
that? and erge mai ‘because of that’ have a recapitulative function. In
referring to the prior stretch of discourse, they bridge the gap between
two narrative units, e.g. MNNCWC aqoywNg Naq [eBOA] NOI

10.1.5 Subject inversionSubject inversion is an information-packaging construction used
when the nominal subject is in focus. The focalised subject linearly
follows the verb and the direct object, yielding the non-canonical order
V-—O —-S. The informational status of the inverted subject is registered
by a dedicated focus particle nov. To disambiguate the relational role of
the postverbal constituent, subject inversion is always accompanied byinsertinga pronominalplaceholderin the preverbalSubject-inverted sentences like NrepeqxeNalAGNGIsubjectslot.","[159, 160]"
