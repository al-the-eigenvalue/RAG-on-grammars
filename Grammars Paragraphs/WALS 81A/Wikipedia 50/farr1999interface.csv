"3 .2 FUNCTIONS
NPS function at three levels: syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic.
The syntactic functions of N Ps are the structural relationships (e.g. subject, object) they
have in clauses and sentences, reflected in their marking, constituent order and concord
relationships.
Semantic functions specify the roles (e.g. agent, patient, benefactive, locative) that NP
referents play within an activity or state of affairs.
Pragmatic functions specify the nature of the information NPs communicate, i.e. the
speaker's topic and the salient information to be communicated. This takes into account the
world view of the speech-act participants, their current state of knowledge, and their spatial
and temporal perspectives. Those entities that are controlling or effecting change in a
situation or being changed or contrasted with other entities are also pragmatically marked.
Syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic functions are signalled by coding devices. Korafe
segmental coding devices include: ( 1 ) cross-referencing of person and number of subject on
verbs, (2) NP markers and (3) word order and equi-NP deletion. Suprasegmental coding
devices include: (4) pauses and (5) placement of stress in future final verb forms and accent
in intonation contours.",[101]
"4. 1 .2 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF CLAUSES WITH V ERBAL PREDICATESKorafe verbal predicates follow the syntactic arguments (core and oblique NPS) in verbal
clauses. Constituent order in Korafe verbal clauses is governed by pragmatic constraints,
rather than being fixed syntactically. Only the verb-final position is rigidly adhered to.
Verbal clauses that can manifest only one core argument, the subject NP, are intransitive.
Those that can manifest two core arguments, the subject NP and another unmarked NP with
object function, are transitive clauses. Although SOy represents the unmarked order of core
constituents in transitive verbal clauses, other configurations (i.e. 0 S V , S V , 0 v , v) also
occur. Oblique arguments may also be ' sprinkled' throughout verbal clauses. This non­
configurational structure can be represented as:
(NP)n + V [+subject marked],1 12Chapter 4in which NP includes PP (postpositional phrases) and on' indicates 0-5 arguments ? Clauses
occur with three unmarked (or core) arguments under certain conditions, detailed in §4.4.4
and its accompanying sub-sections. Clauses may be bounded by pauses.","[131, 132]"
"The pragmatic functions Korafe has, the word order demonstrated by these functions and
the morphological indicators of pragmatic functions in Korafe are outlined in the following
sections: 3.2. 3 . 1 , 3 .2.3.2 and 3 . 2 . 3 . 3 .
3 .2.3 . 1 WORD ORDER AND PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONS
Korafe has two pragmatic structures:Noun phrases95P2:THEME, P l :TOPIC S 0 V, P3:TAIL (Dik 1 978 : 1 9-2 1 i2 andP2:THEME, P l :TOPIC COMMENT(NPIPP-(ri)) , P3 :TAIL.","[114, 115]"
"CHAPTER 3NOUN PHRASES: THEIR STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS3 . 1 STRUCTURE
Korafe has several types of noun phrases (NPS). These include: headless noun phrases,
noun phrases headed by personal pronouns, conjoined noun phrases, juxtaposed and
summarising noun phrases.
Korafe also has a number of complement and relative constructions that function as
heads or modifiers ofNPs.3 . l . l STANDARD NPS
Standard NPs occur with an obligatory head, an optional pre-head and four optional post­
head modifying constituents. 1 The head consists of a noun or a nominal compound. The
2
pre-head constituent is a possessive modifier, realised by a genitive postpositional phrase.
The post-head modifying constituents describe the nominal head or position it deictically.
The post-head modifying constituents are ordered as follows: one to two qualifiers or
qualifier phrases, one quantifier or quantifier phrase and a determiner.3 The structure of the
standard N P is set out in Table 3 . 1 .
TABLE 3. 1 : STRUCTURE OF THE KORAFE STANDARD NOUN PHRASEPre-head:Head:(possessor)noun/nominal compoundPost-head:
2
(qualifier 1 - ) (quantifier) ( determiner)Although the above table gives the potential constituents, Korafe standard NPs are not
found with more than four modifying constituents and do not usually occur with more than23Korafe is not unusual among Papuan languages in having pre-head genitive and post-head attributive
modifiers (cf. Foley 1 986:85 [Yimas], Reesink 1 987: 1 20- 1 22 [Usan], Roberts 1 987:84-87 [Amele] as
well as the Binandere family languages).
Postpositional phrases have the general constituent structure:
NP=postposition, e.g. gagara=da 'of the girl' or gagara eveva=da 'of the good girl ' .
Postpositions cliticise (marked b y =) t o the final constituent i n the N P . Postpositions with heavy
[(c)vv] syllables or two syllables may occur with word stress on their initial syllable. Postpositional
phrases are detailed more fully in §3.2.
This order accords with the universals # 1 8, # 1 9 and #20 that Greenberg ( 1 963:58-90) suggests for SOy
languages. As was stated in Chapter 1 , nominals constitute a major word category that includes nouns,
qualifiers and quantifiers among its subcategories. Although undifferentiated morphologically, nouns
differ from qualifiers and quantifiers in distribution and in number of semantic properties.","[86, 87]"
"The text of spoken and written discourse is, by definition, linear, with clauses following
each other. The ordering of clauses in chaining structures is intended to represent the iconic
order of the events described, or at least the speaker' s view of the order. The use of
simultaneous medial verb forms allows for overlap slippage, but in most cases in Korafe,
the onset of the event expressed by the initial verb in a sequence occurs at least slightly
before the onset of the event expressed by the the subsequent verb it overlaps with. In
temporal mismatches, the referential discrepancy between S 1 and S2 highlights the break inApparent anomalies in SRCs237iconic ordering that they represent. Unlike most of the examples of the other mismatched
types of S2 clauses discussed above, S2 does not temporally intervene between the event
encoded in S I and the event encoded in S3. Instead, S2 overlaps with these events. Like the
' Western' movies, the linear order with its mismatch between S I and S2 suggests a
'meanwhile back at the ranch house' switch from S I to S2. S I is part of one event line, and S2
brings in a second event line. 1 7 The real character that this mismatch in temporal
sequencing exhibits is better shown by the following schema, in which ' ... ' signals that the
onset of the event or state S2 encodes occurs at an uncertain time and ' ( . . . )' that the event or
state that S2 encodes may persist for an indefinite period.
Main event line:
S I (SUBJECr=i) SS.SEQ S3 (SUBJECT =i)
Subsidiary event line:
. .. S2 (SUB JECT =J) DS.SI M ( ··· )The nature of S2'S overlap with SI is not clearly specified. In 7.28 and 7.29, the onset of the
state or event expressed by the verb in S2 overlaps at least partially with that of s l . In 7.30a
and b, it is almost certain that the state described by S2, namely the axe' s permanency as a
household tool, which is already the case before the author of this text even turned around
(jovereghedo) and remains so right up through the time of his searching for it (tava useni),
i.e. S2 completely overlaps with SI and S3.[nati=da

The initial pragmatic structure i s abstracted for Korafe from Dik's ( 1 978: 1 9-2 1 ) language independent
preferred order of constituents ( UPOC) . The UPOC structure that Dik proposes has this format: P2, PI
(v) S (V ) 0 (v), P3, in which ""s and 0 stand for the neutral or unmarked positions of Subject and
Object. The Vs indicate the possible positions of (finite and infinite) verbs. P I , P2, and P3 indicate
'special positions' used for special purposes, and the commas stand for breaks in the intonation"" (Dik
1 978:2 1 ).
It should be noted that Korafe switch-reference constructions (SRCS) can occur with large numbers
of clauses (i.e. (TOPIC) (s) (0) v). Up to 27 have been found in one sentence. SRCS can also manifest
more than one instance of the entire set of constituents from P2 through to p) with several clauses in
between.
Korafe also distinguishes a pragmatic structure centred around a verbless or copular TOPIC­
COMMENT clause, which is represented by the second formula. The occurrence of more than two
TOPIC-COMMENT clauses in one sentence is rare. Sentence-internal TOPIC-COMMENT clauses often
occur without the copula.",[115]
"18Chapter INominals also serve as the base for a number of adverbiaf5 modifiers and modifying
expressions, which function as intensifiers and limiters, verbal and sentential modifiers.
These modifiers are lexicalised combinations of nouns and postpositions (e.g. totoigo
,
' quickly (lit. speed.with.like)', sekago ' again (lit. new.like) . In NPs, intensifiers directly
follow the qualifier or quantifier they modify. When modifying predicates, intensifiers and
other adverbial modifiers precede the predicates.
In contrast with nominals, most verbs have two stems (I and II). Only stem II forms may
occur with an imperfective morpheme. Serial stem forms and medial verb forms occur in
sentence-medial position and relate in status and temporality to the time of a following final
verb. Final verbs (dependent and independent) host inflections for status/tense-aspect­
mood, person and number of subject, and speech-act value.
Complex expressions consisting of a nominal and a generic verb such as 'do', ' say' ,
' see', ' hit' , ' spear', 'continue, do again', 'hold' and ' get' are common in Korafe. They
indicate activities (e.g. yaru e '(do) battle', saramana e '(do) work'), inner states (e.g. ivuga
e ' be happy ', riria e 'be excited'), qualities (e.g. fakina e 'be strong'), and time (ungobu
erira ' it is becoming late afternoon', tumbajirira 'night has fallen'). Some are semantically
opaque: dubo bu ' love (lit. neck get)"" eghovo fakara e 'to set one's resolve (lit. chin hard
do) ' .
As is common in Papuan languages, Korafe makes extensive use of chaining
,,
constructions, in which verbal constituents are in a ""coordinate-dependent 2 6 relationship.
Serial verb constructions (SYcs), formed by the serialisation of verb stems with a terminal
medial or final verb, commonly occur as a constituent of medial verb chaining
constructions, termed switch-reference constructions (SRCS). SRCs indicate the following
relationships between adjacent clauses: ( 1 ) a temporal sequencing or overlap relationship
and (2) identity or non-identity of subject. Co-lexicalised and periphrastic sequences of
serial and medial verbs act as a unit to encode direction-movement, cause-effect,
completion of activity, rhythmic iteration and other semantic notions and aspects.
Information is structured in sentences by the order of arguments and by pragmatic
markers. Although SOY is the default clausal order of core arguments in a clause, OSY
occurs when the object has pragmatic topic function and the subject pragmatic focus
function. In most of these instances, one of the two arguments is additionally marked by a
postposition indicating its pragmatic function, which often cliticises to a demonstrative:
(a) mo 'that (topic/theme)', (a)va 'that (contrastive theme/focus) ' (a) i/(a) imi 'that
(contrastive and controlling theme/focus)' . These markers also link dependent bases to
independent bases in co-ranking hypotactic sentence arrangements where each base
terminates with a final verb. These dependent bases are basically the topical 'point of
departure' that provides the context within which the independent base is operative.
Corresponding to adverbial clauses, relative clauses and complement clauses in English,
2526There is one word ufena 'secretly', which is of uncertain origin, but has adverbial function. A few
adverbial modifiers are derived from verbs. Manner can be encoded by negative deverbal forms such as
sembae 'wrongly (lit. not cross)'. The notion of manner can also be encoded by the initial verb in some
SVcs.
This term is from Foley ( 1 986: 1 77).","[37, 38]"
"14Chapter 1Vowel iength 20 is phonemic and is written as VV. Heterogeneous vowel sequences occur
as bimoric complex nuclei in syllable rhymes. The oral set includes all possible
combinations but 'uo'. The nasal set is limited, with only the second vowel being nasalised
in several cases: 'iii', ' ill , 'ei' , ""eu' 'ai' '01' , and 'ui' . A few words exhibit lengthened
vowels occurring in heterogeneous vowel sequences as complex V1V2V 2 nuclei in a syllable
(e.g. aii 'yes', kiuun 'sneeze').
Korafe has the following syllable patterns: v, CV, VV, CVV, VVV, CVVV.
Korafe words are stress-timed, with longer words pronounced in approximately the same
time as shorter words. Primary stress within a word is associated with a 'heavy' syllable, a
syllable which is uttered for a longer duration than the other syllables in the word. For
instance, a spectograph of an utterance of beka ['beg.kh a] 'mouth' indicates that [beg] was
uttered for 2.29 seconds and [kh a] for 1.69 seconds. In a similar word biM [big.'kh a]
'sister-in-law' receiving stress on its second syllable, [big] was uttered for 1.36 seconds and
[kh a] for 2.29 seconds. A heavy syllable may also manifest increased amplitude and a
higher pitch.
Stress is predictable for most of the words in Korafe. Non-verbs and verb stems manifest
word stress on: (1) the initial syllable of words with two syllables (2) the second syllable of
words with more than two syllables, or (3) the first (c)vv(v) syllable (when this pattern
occurs). In inflected verb forms, 2 1 stress falls on the initial vowel of vowel-initial suffixes
following either the verb stem or an imperfective morpheme when one occurs in post-stem
position. When an imperfective morpheme is not present and the suffix begins with a
consonant, stress falls on the stem vowel or the classificatory vowel. Where stress is not
predictable, an acute C) accent is written over the most sonorous vowel in the stressed
syllable.
Some basic Korafe intonation contours are illustrated in Chapter 4. More detailed
information on allophonic variation, phonotactics, and other aspects of Korafe phonology is
given in FaIT and FaIT ( 1974: 5-38).
1.6 TYPOLOGY
Korafe is morphologically agglutinating, primarily hosting suffixes and enclitics. It
exhibits both head-marking and dependent-marking strategies:20
21head-markingdependent-markingclausespredicates
auxiliary verbsoblique argumentsnoun phrasesnounsqualifiers
possessorsIn Farr and FaIT ( 1 974:26), this vowel length was interpreted as word tone. And a slight down-glide
often does accompany the lengthened vowel.
There are two other subsidiary rules for the today's past and future tense paradigms that constitute
exceptions to this general rule. These are: ( I ) stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable when a today's
past tense verb form has more than two syllables (e.g. seteni 'I said', tendeni ' I lashed', but beni ' I got'),
and (2) stress perturbs from the initial syllable of the future tense suffix to the second syllable when the
focused element in the clause is not the verb (e.g. Na yarena ' I will go', Na Tufi yarena ' I will go to
Tufi. ).
'Introduction15The unmarked order of core constituents i n the clause is subject-object-verb (sov), but
word order of clausal constituents is fairly free with the one stipulation that the verb be last.
In fact, the verb is the only constituent of the clause that obligatorily occurs. Any argument
that is recoverable from the discourse context or the external deictic situation can be elided.
Korafe distinguishes two major open word classes: nominals and verbs. Nominals
include words that correspond to the categories: noun, qualifier, quantifier, numerator, and
adverb in English. Processes that apply to nominals include inflecting for plurality,
intensity, and/or specific focus, but nominals usually occur without inflections. As is typical
for Papuan languages, verbs are morphologically complex, undergoing agglutinating and
fusional processes which link stems with their corresponding inflections. Verb forms differ
from nominals in the inflectional categories they host, intensification strategies, and the
stress rules that apply to them.
Closed word classes having referential function in discourse are personal pronouns,
interrogatives/indefinites, and demonstratives-deictics. Other closed word classes include:
postpositions, conjunctions, and sentential focus markers. Interjections, response words and
greetings are numerically limited, but the Korafe repertoire is expanding to include English
interjections and responses.
Postpositions often cliticise to the preceding noun phrase or sentence base that they
relate to a larger construction or to the discourse deictic context. They function as: ( 1 )
semantic case role markers, (2) markers of pragmatic functions, and (3) modal indicators.
Markers of semantic case roles and pragmatic functions are enumerated, and their
function(s) with noun phrases are specified in Chapter 3. Some combinations of these
postpositions with nominals, personal pronouns, demonstratives, and interrogatives/
indefinites are lexically frozen (e.g. sovenida ' across from' , eloda ' on top of' , ikxida,
dengesida 'beside', all nominals occurring with the general locative postposition da to
specify a position).
Epistemic and deontic modals terminate sentence bases and left-dislocated themes. The
speaker uses these indicators to declare his or her orientation or attitude towards the deictic
situation detailed. They include: vae 'I'm exasperated', ta ' I ' m annoyed' , lano 'probably
so', tanojo 'perhaps', asi 'certainly (a-si, that-saY.II.evidential indicating reported speech)',
re 'relevant to the immediate deictic situation' and the related demonstrative sets ere, are,
ore which spatially link the event to the speaker, the addressee, or some place away from
both.
Four personal pronoun stems occur in Korafe: na ' 1 ' , ni 'you' , nu 'he, she,it', and ne
'you (pL)/they' . Frozen combinations of these stems with enclitics are used to make dual
and plural as well as first person inclusive and exclusive distinctions. Only pronominal
stems occur with the actor focus suffix -ne and the limiter -suka 'only ' . The nominal
10/0/1010/0 ' self/selves' is used as a reflexive form or to emphasise the subject in a clause
(which is usually a pronoun). Reciprocal relationships are signalled by t% t% .
Interrogative and indefinite words arise from four basic stems. Two are basically
pronominal : ave/mave 'who' and re ' what' . The referential specifier -jo (avejo ' who
specifically?') and semantic case role and pragmatic function markers occur with these two16Chapter 1pronominal forms. The stem ningi 'which' always combines with forms that are based on
,
the demonstrative a 'that' (ningia 'which one?'). The verb stem nange 'how (lit. do what)
is the only Korafe verb that may be followed by the comparative postposition go/gao In
content questions, the question word retains the same position in the clause as its
antecedent except in the case of subject where OSV order often occurs.
All members of the Binandere family manifest the same three-way set of demonstrative
stems: e 'this near the speaker', a 'that near the addressee' , and 0 'that away from both ' .
Markers o f pragmatic functions directly follow demonstratives (amo 'regarding that one',
ava 'that as opposed to any others'). Modal enclitics also occur with the demonstrative set
(amasi 'regarding that certain one'). Semantic case role markers or the pro-verb ge 'do
(FOCUS)' follow one of the pragmatic effector of change markers i or mi (aindae ' on
,
account of that', aminda 'there', aminge 'do thus'). The term 'deictics 22 encompasses the
entire range of demonstrative-based forms.
Korafe contrasts with some Papuan23 languages in having upwards of 20 conjunctions
and conjunction complexes, which are related to demonstrative forms and/or same-subject
medial verb forms. An inventory of these forms and their functions in co-ranking sentences
is catalogued in Chapter 8. Their function in SRCs is outlined in §6.2.4.
Sentential focus particles include the negative focus marker jo ' not' , the proposition
specifier nu 'this proposition selected from the available ones', taka 'just, frustratingly' .
Sentential focus words such as avose 'perhaps (lit. that. CT. say)' and avori 'all right (lit.
,
that.cT.coP) may also occur in isolation as response words. Other than jo which precedes
the negated constituent in focus, these sentential focus markers either occur sentence­
initially or following the subject and are often set off by pauses from the rest of the
sentence. Tag markers for polar questions (e.g. ai 'yes?', ai tefo 'yes or no?' ) also belong to
this class. However, they are set off at the terminus of the sentence by pauses.
Interjections (termed yove in Korafe) are a small set of uninflected words and fixed
expressions that the Korafe employ to express emotional reactions (e.g. mara 'what a
shame' , arie ' wow! '). Among the response words and expressions the Korafe use are:
aavori 'that' s sufficient', aii 'yes' , and aiyakoe or tanik yu 'thank you' . Like the sentential
focus particles, interjections and response words may be set off from an accompanying
sentence by pauses; but more normally they are uttered in isolation associated with an
intonation contour that can display considerable pitch variation. Greetings and farewells
(termed ategi in Korafe) occur in isolation or with a vocative expression. The current daily
greeting Sifo eveva! ' Good day ! (lit. day good)' has largely replaced the traditional
greetings using present tense forms of verbs (e.g. /resa! 'You are staying! ' , Refesa! ' You
are coming! ', Ravasi! 'You have slept! '). Command forms of verbs (e.g. Anumbeyo! 'Sit ! ' ,
/yo! ' Go ! ' , A viyo! ' S leep ! ') continue to b e used a s farewells. Interj ections and other
utterances that are shouted at a distance terminate with an -0.","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"Three types of speech-packaging devices are used by Korafe speakers in oral and written
texts : ( 1 ) word order, (2) postpositions and other syntactic markers (including
demonstratives, interrogative-indefinites, and focal pronouns) (3) phonological features.",[114]
"11/1 OsecsJ254Chapter 8(2) Pragmatic relationships between co-ranking basesAccording to Mathesius ( 1 939), the pragmatic ordering of information often begins with
the known or the obvious and proceeds to the less obvious. Linguists associated with the
Prague School have used the words ' theme ' and ' rheme' to describe this type of
information packaging. Others have used terms like 'topic-comment' and ' given-new' . But
the information encoded by themes is not always given or old information. Recognising
this, Halliday ( 1 985:38, 53) defines theme 7 as ""what the speaker selects as his point of
departure"". 8 It is developed by the rheme ""the remainder of the message"".
This bipartite theme-rheme relationship is expressed intraclausally and interclausally in
Korafe sentences. Its intraclausal use in topic-comment clauses with the format PI :TOPIC +
COMMENT (NP/PP-(ri) is described in §4. 1 . l and §4.2. 1 . The notion of a pragmatic function
labelled theme (P2), its use in conjunction with the topic (p I ), and the markers signalling
themes and topics were presented and illustrated by NPs in §3.2.3 . 1 and § 3 .2.3.2.
Interclausally in Korafe, both theme and rheme may be expressed by sentence bases.
The clause or base with theme function is dependent on but not embedded in the dominant
base, which functions as the rheme. In 8 . 7 both theme and rheme bases are multiclausal
SRCs. The demonstrative amo 'that, when' terminates the thematic base, which provides the
background within which the rheme base is relevant.

' When I took a good look at it while it was coming up (to the surface),
we saw (something) silver coming up (to the surface).'
Theme and rheme bases may be juxtaposed without a conjunction, as in example 8.8.
Again, the theme expresses the background within which the rheme base is relevant.

It is not always true, however, that ""the cognitive point of departure coincides with the communicative
point of departure"" (Lyons 1 977: 508). Mithun ( 1 987:304) observes that word order does not always
begin with given information or even the topic of discussion. She has found in the American Indian
languages, Cayuga, Ngandi and Coos, that word order is based on ""the relative newsworthiness of the
constituents to the discourse"".","[273, 274]"
"The following properties are common to all Korafe SVCs:
( 1 ) They contain a series of two or more verbs.
(2) The verbs are ordered iconically, reflecting the order of the events they refer to, or, at
least, the speaker' s perception of the order of events.",[173]
"2
Subject referents that are lower on the animacy hierarchy 4 than object referents can still
occur as unmarked agents when the default SOY order is maintained. In example 3 . 1 06a, the
Papuan Black snake is certainly lower on the animacy hierarchy than people are, but it is
not marked.",[118]
"CHAPTER 9STANDARDI SED SEQUENCES OF VERBS AND THEMATIC
CLAUSE CHAIN UNITS (TCCUs)This chapter examines standardised ways of expressing particular types of events and
situations. It takes up the question: How are things said in Korafe?
In a much-cited passage, Chomsky ( 1 965 :4) stated that a grammar of a language should
be a systematic description of the linguistic competence of native speakers, competence
being ""the speaker-hearer' s knowledge of the language"". Echoing this view, Radford
( 1 988:3, 27) indicates that ""a model of a native speaker's competence"" is ""a grammar that
tells us what we need to know in order to be fluent in a language"", a grammar being ""a
finite system of rules which generate . . . the infinite set of well-formed sentence-structures in
the language"". In the structuralist grammarian's view, the lexicon is part of the grammar,
lexical items being the form-meaning pairs in a language, morphemes and idioms, that are
unpredictable by the rules of grammar. I
Pawley ( 1 985 :87-90, 1 994 : 7- 1 8, 27) argues that this ' grammar-lexicon model' presents
2
an ""impoverished account of linguistic competence"". He argues that a proper speaker
should show nativelike standards in: producing grammatical utterances, pronouncing words
and adhering to conventional intonation, stress and rhythm patterns, being able to decode
fluent speech, knowing the idiomatic way of saying things as opposed to ways that are
merely grammatical, distinguishing between standardi sed expressions and ad hoc
descriptions, and saying the right thing at the right time.
Drawing on the work of Grace ( 1 987), Pawley proposes an alternative view of languages
as ' subject matter codes (or languages)' . A description of a subject-matter language would2In recent years, the scope of the lexicon generativists propound has been extended from a minimalist list
to include: ( I ) more grammatical information about individual lexemes and (2) forms that were initially
derived by rules of morphonology and syntax, e.g. nominalisations. However, it still differs considerably
from dictionaries that lexicographers make. Pawley ( 1 986: 1 0 1 ) lists a number of morpheme sequences
that dictionaries like Webster 's have but grammarians would count as literal expressions, formed by
productive processes, hence not included in their lexicons.
The term 'grammar-lexicon model' is from Grace ( 1 98 1 ).
In the 1 960s, Pawley sought to do a grammar and lexicon of Kalam, a Papuan language. Feeling
dissatisfied both with his grammatical description and early drafts of the lexicon, he ( 1 993 : 1 03) makes
this comment: ""My thesis . . . failed to record some of the most distinctive and quintessential
characteristics of the language. The analysis did not give the reader much idea of how the Kalam
actually say the kinds of things that they say. The most productive patterns for reporting events and
situations, for instance, were not distinguished from those patterns that were grammatical but

"2Chapter 1verbs (including medial verbs that are the predicates of distinct clauses) are found in
Korafe. These units convey semantic notions such as direction+motion, posture+state,
cause+effect, manner+action, iteration at uneven intervals and rhythmic iteration. These
predictable verb sequences are integrated into the structure of a unit, here termed the
thematic clause chain unit (TCCU). TCCUs represent the speaker' s chunking of information
into intonational pause-free units.
Chapter 1 0 compares the use of chaining and co-ranking constructions in discourse. A
prototypical chaining paragraph is contrasted with a prototypical thematic paragraph. It
outlines the discourse structure rules that characterise discourses in general and
differentiate discourse genres, making use of tense-iconic chaining structures and logically
ordered 'thematic' structures as well as speech formulas. It concludes with a delineation of
some common scripts that are threaded into the warp and woof of Korafe discourses.
Devices encoding cohesion and prominence in Korafe discourse are the focus of Chapter
11.
This study is designed to enrich the growing corpus of data on Papuan languages, which
are still under-represented in typological and theoretical accounts of the languages in the
world. It builds on the research of many of my colleagues in the Summer Institute of
Linguistics' as well as that of others analysing Papuan languages ? It expands on those
frontiers in the following ways:

"1 0.2 GENERAL DISCOURSE STRUCTURE RULES
All discourses occur in a deictic context. This includes the speaker, the addressee(s), the
world view(s) of the speech act participants, the setting within which the speaker is
communicating the information, his or her reason for communicating it, and the
appropriateness of the information for the occasion.
Discourse structure rules specify the things that may be said and the order in which they
may be said. In this section, we focus on the general set of constituents, which are part of
all oral discourses and texts.
All oral discourses and texts have an introduction, a plot or a theme with its supporting
arguments, and a conclusion. Many also have a final formulaic closing statement. Legends
and letters have in addition formulaic introductory words which signal the discourse onset,
called 'apertures' .",[362]
"In example 3 . 5 2 , the only core N P (with grammatical function s) is the pronoun nu ' it' . It
triggers third person singular agreement marking on the verb.
3.52s
Tumba=mo,nu avi-raira.night=TIF
� sleep-cusT.�.FN
'Nights, it sleeps. '
It should b e noted that the subject category i s determined by verb coreferencing markers
rather than by constituent ordering restrictions, even though SV I AOV is the default
constituent order for Korafe verbal clauses. In example 3 .53 , the subject must be nomburai
'the crocodile' , because it is the third person singular NP that the verb coreferences.

' Don't go down to the river. (If you do,) The crocodile will bite you now. '
(2) Only N Ps that realise the grammatical relation subject govern ' switch-reference
marking, which includes coreferential relationships between purpose constructions and
their matrix clauses. The subject NP in marking clauses is cross-referenced on verbs
terminating marking clauses. Across clause boundaries, subject tracking indicators
mark coreferentiality or its absence between the subjects of the clauses.
In example 3 . 5 4 , the marking on the medial verbfugeteso cross-references a second person
singular referent as its subject. It also indicates that this second person singular referent is
not the subject of the subsequent adj acent clause.",[102]
"23

25As Delancey ( 1 98 1 :632) expresses it, ""events have an inherent natural AF [ATTENTION FLOW], which
recreates the flow of attention involved in actually witnessing the event"". The speaker with a different
perspective on events may rearrange NPs to reflect his or her viewpoint.
Delancey (1981 :627-628,644) labels the animacy hierarchy the 'empathy hierarchy', incorporating the
following distinctions: SAP (speech-act participants) > 3rd pronouns > human > animate > natural
forces > inanimate.
Korafe does not have passive voice. However, objects can be topicalised (one of the functions of the
English passive construction) by fronting them in osv-ordered clauses. Unlike English, the agent NP in
the Korafe construction is not demoted to an obi ique function; it sti II is cross-referenced as subject on
the verb.",[118]
"In Korafe, the object is topicalised and the subject given FOCUS function by assigning OSY

order to the arguments. 5 In these cases when the subject is lower on the animacy hierarchy,
one of the two N Ps must be marked. In example 3 . 1 06b, the subj ect is marked by the
effector of change marker, { imi} . Example 3 . 1 06c is ill-formed, because neither one of the
arguments is marked.

"The three clausal components of 'temporal mismatches' are: ( 1 ) the initial marking clause
( S I ) predicated by a SS medial verb, (2) the 'mismatched' reference clause (S 2 ) predicated
by a D S medial verb, and (3) the subsequent clause ( S 3 ) predicated by a perception or
feeling predication. 1 5 S I and S 3 must have the same subject referent. The linear structure of
this mismatch can be diagrammed :
S I ( SUBJECT=i)SS.SEQ S 2 ( SUBJECT=j)DS.SIM S 3 ( SUBJECT=i)The mismatched clause ( S 2) may be either transitive or intransitive. A simultaneous medial
form of the verb predicates the mismatched clause. The temporal overlap encoded in this
mismatch is partial or total between marking ( S I ) and reference ( S 2 ) clauses, and total
between S 2 and S 3 . However, S I and S 3 are ordered to represent the iconic order of the
events they encode. 16 S 3 often encodes a perception event.",[255]
"6'the fish (called) dugong'
'the name orchid'
'the bird (called) owl'Pronouns also are heads of NPS, but they occur without pre-head modifiers and qualifier post-head
modifiers. Like NPS , sentential complements and relative clauses and clause sequences in Korafe
function as subject and object in matrix clauses and as left-dislocated themes in sentences. However,
they cannot occur with the range of modifiers that the standard noun phrase does. They are discussed
in §3 . 1 .7 and Chapter 8, §8. 1 0 and §8. 1 1 .
The modifier constituent in noun + modifier compounds may be either a qualifier or a quantifier
nominal. In modifier + noun compounds, it is a qualifier nominal, a deverbal or a noun, acting as a
modifier.
Of the criteria that Pike ( 1 947: 1 67) lists for identifying compounds, the following apply to Korafe
nominal compounds. ( I ) All compounds occur in fixed order without any pause between the segments.
(2) Some can be inflected for plurality as a unit. (3) Only the stressed syllable of one of the
components, usually the last one, is given additional stress intensity, which often coincides with a
higher pitch than all the syllables of the other components manifest.",[89]
"As indicated in the discussion of circumstantial semantic roles i n § 3 .2.2.2, the
postposition { imi} 29 'effector of change' marks NPs with INSTRUMENT and MEANS roles. It29The Korafe effector of change marker { imi} has two forms: i and imi. Both i and imi follow NPs
cliticising to the terminus of the NP they are relating to the predicate or a larger discourse chunk; their
usage in this context is not clearly differentiated in the corpus of Korafe data available to us. However,
in combination with a demonstrative root (e , a , 0), i precedes the postpositions: ghae and de
(comitative dual and plural): ainghae/ainde 'with that one'l'with those' , da (possession): ainda 'of

the order is OSY, as in 3 . 1 23b.

textually evoked, but the speaker focuses on both referents as the entities initiating the
event (i.e. gagara eimi 'this girl') and being affected by it (i.e. Remukoe ava ' Remukoe,

The {imi} marker might be construed to mark NPs as having the ergative 30 case, if we just
examined the previous examples in which it marks subjects in transitive clauses. However,30cliticise to demonstratives and then is followed by the postpositions da (locative): aminda 'there' and
go (comparative): amingo ' like that one'.
All the other documented languages in the Binandere family register a subject marker mi and the
demonstrative ami or meni and also a pronominal actor marker, marked by -na in Suena, Orokaiva and
Baruga, -nemi/-nei in Ewage-Notu, and -ne in Korafe. They also have markers of objects and
sentences very close to the Korafe ava (e.g. awa [Suena,Binandere], awo [Orokaiva], awa and awawa
[Ewage-Notu], agha [Baruga]. For more details, see Wilson ( 1 994:79-84) for Suena, Capell ( 1 969b:4),
Larsen and Larsen ( 1 982:78,80) for Orokaiva, Parrington ( 1 978?:37,57-58) for Ewage-Notu, and Farr
and Farr field notes for Baruga.
Ergativity, as defined by Dixon ( 1 979: 59-62) is a syntactically based marking system in which
morphological case marking and/or syntactic constraints distinguish the A syntactic relation from the S
and 0 syntactic relations which are treated alike. Ergativity documented in Papuan languages is
usually realised by case marking on the A syntactic relation. Researchers commonly report
nominative/accusative syntax with constraints that reflect an A/S pivot. Li and Lang ( 1 979:3 2 1 )
suggest that ""ergativity i s restricted t o case markings w ithout any syntactic o r discourse
consequences"", but add that a correlation does exist between the ""use of the ergative marker on the
subject of a complex sentence and the requirement of an agent by the subordinate verb"".
From his survey of 35 Papuan languages, Whitehead ( 1 9 8 1 : 50-5 1 ) concluded that case marking
utilised on the agent or actor does not consistently manifest canonical ergativity. He notes that1 04Chapter 3it also marks NPs that are subjects in intransitive clauses and objects in transitive clauses. In
example 3 . 1 26 repeated from 3 . 1 1 0c, the i-marked NP is the subject of an intransitive clause
which has as its predicate the verb ambu 'die' .

'Or when a man dies, we say 'widow' about (his) wife.' (A man ' s death causes
his wife to become a widow.)Like the NPs marked with { imi} in preceding examples, genemboi 'the man' is an effector
of change. Although his demise is non-volitional, he does initiate the cycle of events that
turns his wife into a widow. Likewise in example 3 . 1 27, although the { imi} marks an NP in
a clause where it has syntactic object function, it plays the INSTRUMENT role for the events
encoded in the subsequent clause.amb-ari. . .

'Contrastive focus is also indicated by {imi} . In example 3 . 1 28, the force, the sun (iji=i)

' Let the sun dry the sea cucumbers; don't smoke (them) ! '31languages surveyed have the following conditioning factors for marking Agents and Actors: ( I )
displacement from initial position, (2) introduction of new participants, (3) emphasis of one group of
participants over or to the exclusion of another, and (4) the identification of the controlling identities at
the various stages of discourse.
Arguments encoding FORCE do not require marking when the effect of the FORCE is a natural
consequence of its existence and in cases where neither its control in the situation nor the exclusion of
other possible forces is focused on. Anderson and Wade ( 1 988:9, 1 4) note that the ergative marker in
Folopa (Southern Highlands Province Papuan language) is not required to mark NPs referencing
entities that are performing routine social activities ""in which control is de-emphasized"". Therefore, in
the following Korafe example where the natural process of cut grass and bush drying in the sun is
described, iji 'the sun' is not marked with -i 'EFFECTOR OF CHANGE' and does not function as the
syntactic subject with FORCE semantic role. Instead, it is an adjunct, form ing a nom inal+verb

Indeed, in this example, verbal morphology prohibits the use of ijii 'the sun, EFFECTOR OF CHANGE' as
subject with FORCE role. The verb fasedo ' lie down' is marked to indicate that the next verb has the
same subject, and it has, as its understood subject, enda 'the ground (bush)' . Therefore, the subsequent
verb avare 'that it may dry' is required to have enda as its understood subject; ijii cannot function as
its subject.","[122, 123, 124]"

Although Korafe does not have any verb stems that have grammaticised as the indicator
of cause, iconically ordered verb sequences have the potential for encoding cause-and­
effect relationships. Example 5.45 illustrates one of the instances where an SVC manifests
this relationship. The stones used as the house' s foundation are both the object put in place
(jiti) and the subject of the verb vitira ' it ascended'.",[192]
"Introduction19they realise the protasis in conditional sentences, the frustrated proposition i n adversative
sentences, the result in result-reason sentences, and also the unembedded, internally­
headed 'relative constructions' in Korafe. Dependent bases that are not set off by pauses
embed as complements or relative clauses within the independent base.
The chaining sentence structure has received much attention in the literature on Papuan
languages. However, it is not the only sentential option available to Korafe. The co-ranking
sentence structure, in which each base terminates with a final verb, is also employed by the
Korafe. Co-ranking structures manifest either hypotactic relationships, like those mentioned
in the previous paragraph, or paratactic relationships, where both bases are independent and
linked by a coordinating conjunction. The Korafe make use of both structures in
conversation and in oral and written discourse.
Chaining structures are designed to relate information that depends on temporal
succession. In chaining constructions, noun phrases that are recoverable from the discourse
or deictic context are elided. This reduction in noun phrases brings with it a corresponding
focus on the events represented by the verbs in chaining structures. The order of the verbs
in chaining structures is non-reversible and mirrors the order of the events they represent in
the real world. This tense-iconic focus on events makes chaining structures choice vehicles
for expressing the foregrounded story-line in narratives, legends, procedures, and portions
of other discourses in which iconic ordering is a key feature.
Co-ranking sentences are juxtaposed or joined by conjunctions, which encode logical
relationship·s between the bases. These structures o ften expound descriptive and
explanatory discourses. They are also utilised for argumentation in hortatory and epistolary
discourses. Background information in tense-iconic discourses often is given by suspending
the chaining structure and using co-ranking structures.","[38, 39]"
"82Chapter 3grammatical functions provide the basis for defining the grammatical relations (i.e. subject,
object) that occur in a given language. The grammatical relation, subject, is identified by a
number of syntactic features in Korafe. See ( 1 )-(4) below.
( 1 ) The subject NP is cross-referenced for person and number on the final verb in the
clause . Following a nominative-accusative pattern, Korafe verbs cross-reference
transitive and intransitive subj ects (Dixon' s A and s). Example 3 . 5 1 has two core NPs
having the grammatical functions, A and o. In this case, the NP with A function ni 'you
(2S)' is cross-referenced on the verb.","[101, 102]"
"Subject matter lexemes consist chiefly of names and terms, i.e. ""expressions that native
speakers recognise as conventional and institutionalised and which substitute for part of
speech categories (N , V , etc.)"" (Pawley 1 986: I 03). This would include not only the
morphemes and idioms present in the ' grammarian' s lexicon' , but also the well-formed
complex and compound words that are typically included as dictionary entries in
lexicographer's dictionaries, e.g. brotherliness, forgettable, forgetful, forgetfulness.
Speech formulas are ""conventional ways of saying things for definable discourse
purposes"" (Pawley 1 994:7). Prototypical speech formulas are ""bundles of at least seven
components: meaning, grammar, lexical form, naturalness (idiomaticity) constraints,
discourse function, discourse context, and prosody or musical conventions. Built into each
formula is a specification of what to say, when to say it, how to say it and why"" (Pawley
1 995 : 7-8). A gestural component is also obligatory for speech formulas used by speech-act
participants face-to-face.
Pawley ( 1 9 83 :88-95, 1 994 : 1 4- 1 8) distinguishes fixed, semiproductive, and productive
speech formulas. Formulas that are fixed occur with invariant lexical content and word
order. Examples from English include: A rolling stone gathers no moss!, A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush! The formula Good day! is a typical greeting. God bless you! is
often said when someone sneezes.
Semiproductive formulas occur with severe constraints on the variation. An example is:What in the name of NP!, used to express extreme annoyance, where there are only a few
acceptable variations of the NP constituent. Two are: What in the name of blue blazes! and
What in the name of heaven!
Productive formulas are constructions whose lexical content is only partly specified.
Some English formulas are : NPi turned on NP;S heel, The ADJi-er (x) the ADJi/j (Y)! as in The
sooner he leaves town, the better! or The sooner you start, the sooner you 'll be done!, NPi
got NPis nose(s) all out ofjoint, NPi is out to get NP/ Many variables can realise the NPs and
ADJs in exponents of these formulas. Often the tense of the verb can change, as in the
following token of the final formula above: John was out to get Charlie.
The ethnography of discourse involves ""identifying discourse genres and relating each to
wider systems of knowledge and rules of behaviour, and specifying the discourse structure
rules for each genre"" Pawley ( 1 994:20). Discourse structure rules ""specify an agenda of
things that may be said with an order in which they may be said"" ( 1 994 : 1 8).
In Korafe, expressions describing most conventional activities consist largely of
sequences of verbs. In order to speak Korafe idiomatically, one must memorise these
standardised verb sequences and master the rules governing their use in discourse. Failure
to do so will hamper not only one ' s fluency in Korafe, but also one ' s ability to apply
syntactic processes like negation correctly to such verb sequences. Without this knowledge,
one is likely to omit verbs that should be included and insert NPs where ellipsis is required.",[310]
"242Chapter 7Thus, it is not always the subject, the agent, or the topic that plays the pivotal role in
determining the marking of referential switches in Korafe S R Cs. Participant-centred
explanations that focus only on a pivotal NP are inadequate for explaining the total switch­
reference system in Korafe, which must include apparent anomalies as well. That is
because switch-reference expresses a relationship between clauses, not merely between
NPs. As Stirling ( 1 993 : 1 3 6) suggests, ""SR is a clause level function which does not deal
with the reference of NPs as such but with degrees and types of cohesion between
eventualities"".
Five types of cohesion that produce ' event integration' (Givon 1 98 3 : 53-54, 1 987: 1 79,
1 990a:827) are: ( 1 ) referential continuity, (2) temporal continuity, (3) location continuity,
(4) action continuity and (5) thematic continuity. Continuity and discontinuity of reference,
temporality, and action play a major role in signalling relationships between clauses in the
Korafe switch-reference system.
As was previously noted, continuity and discontinuity of syntactic subject referents is
encoded by the canonical switch-reference system.
Temporal continuity or order is maintained in Korafe SRCs by both sequencing and
simultaneous medial verbs. The order of events in the real world imposes a temporal
' straitjacket' on the sequence of medial verbs encoding them. The use of simultaneous
medial verbs in the canonical system does not interrupt this order. The event signalled by a
simultaneous medial verb must commence before the event encoded by the verb in the
reference clause, so at its onset it preserves temporal iconicity. However, its terminus is
unspecified and overlaps with the subsequent event encoded by the reference clause.
Like sequencing medial verbs, simultaneous medial verbs may not normally be reversed
without disturbing the temporal sequence. However, simultaneous medial verbs are the
only medial forms that may be freely reversed when they encode total overlap and are
coordinated by a conj unction that is a free form such as a ' and' and 0 ' o r '?O To indicate
total discontinuity or a complete reversaf 1 of temporal order, co-ranking structures with
final verbs must be used.
Regarding action continuity, Givon ( 1 983 :54) suggests that:
. . . action continuity is the domain of chaining verbs/predications one after
another within the thematic paragraph in a way that coheres or makes temporal
or causal sense.
He adds, "" . . foreground clauses . . . tend to maintain the sequence of action continuity"".
For Korafe then, the canonical SRC is certainly the domain of foregrounded clauses. It has
been claimed (Labov and Waletzky 1 966: 20-2 1 ) that ""only independent clauses are20
21The ss and os indicators can be viewed as conjunctions, meaning 'and x' , ' while x, 'then x ' where x
is an event encoded by the medial verb form. However, switch-reference indicators are bound forms;
the conjunctions mentioned here are free forms, having a demonstrative base.
Within the switch-reference system, it is possible to use a negative deverbal together with a medial
form of iri 'remain ' followed by a temporal PP. This structure has the format: 'x remained not having
happened. before that '. Technically, however, the correct temporal ordering is still preserved in this
structure.","[261, 262]"
"1 28Chapter 4This nominal compound can either be regarded as a complement incorporated into the stem
of a verbal lexeme (nominal + verb) or a separate NP argument if expanded into a full NP
with modifiers, e.g. dubo merna feria beM ' very great grief .
It should be noted that the animate entity experiencing the emotion is sometimes cross­
referenced as the verb.

'J am upset over this(lit. I am doing neck pain). ' (And I ' m going to stay that way.)The semantic difference between examples 4 . 6 1 a and 4.62 is one of control . The
impersonal rendering in 4.6 1 a registers an involuntary emotion, something that over­
whelms the animate experiencer. In example 4.62, the animate entity controls the emotion,
choosing to nurse it over a period of time or even to generate it in his mind.
The syntactic function of the animate entity experiencing the bodily process or emotion
cannot be conclusively established in Korafe. It could quite possibly have object function,
because it is an unmarked non-subject argument.9 If that were the case, the clause in the
impersonal experiential construction would have OSV as its normal order. It should be noted
that unlike other clauses manifesting O S V order, in this construction, the putative S
constituent is never marked with the effector of change marker imi.
In fact, there are no clear grammatical criteria for identifying the subj ect of the
impersonal experiential construction, beyond the third person singular subject agreement
marker on the verb. There are at least three posssibilities regarding the identification of a
subject. 10
( 1 ) The body part affected or the bodily response NP when they are not incorporated in the
verb are the subject.
(2) Some unspecified (in most cases) stimulus triggering the response is the subject.
(3) There is no subject. If this solution is adopted, it could apply globally to all cases.
Assigning semantic roles to arguments in these predications is also problematic. The
most plausible role designation for the animate entity is experiencer, and for the body part

10In those Papuan languages that do mark the verb for object agreement, it is clear that the animate entity
is cross-referenced as the object. (See Roberts 1 988a:97, Reesink 1 983 :232-233, and Olson 1 98 1 :296298.)
Stirling ( 1 993 :242-243) gives a fourth explanation for impersonal constructions in Amele, involving a
'dummy subject'. Rejecting Roberts' (forthcoming:77) solution that ""incorporated nominals"" encoding
emotions are co-referenced as subject, she ( 1 993 :242-243) cites the occurrence of the 'pseudo-passive'
in Amele as support for setting up a third person singular ' dummy subject'.
However, one cannot claim precedence for a dummy subject from the pseudo-passive set in Korafe,
because Korafe uses a third person plural, not singular, form for the pseudo-passive, as jitoro 'they put'
below shows .

rather than an experiencer has subject function in impersonal predications encoding
physiological responses. This reverses the subject-accessibility hierarchy, referred to in
§3.2.2 . 1 , in which experiencer is selected as subject before patient. The fact is, though, that
the animate entity never has subject function in impersonal predications. It does, however,
have the genitive circumstantial role in some predications expressing physiological
responses (see example 4.59b).
The question before us is what the third person subject marking on the verb is agreeing
with. Let us briefly consider each of the syntactic alternatives along with some semantic
alternatives.
1 . In physiological responses, the most likely candidate for syntactic subject is the body
part experiencing the response. In examples 4.58 and 4.59a, this NP is a body part, jiro
'head', and in 4.59b ungo ' hand ' . It agrees in person with the third person subject
agreement marking on the verb. However, as plural marking never occurs in such
constructions this fact is not diagnostic. In terms of the semantic relations between
constituents, this body part NP encodes the most likely entity experiencing the response. I I
Physiological or emotional responses (e.g. ighoi etiri 'got hungry' in example 4.60 and
dubo merna erira 'felt grief) can be considered to be incorporated into the verb. However,
when the nominal is modified as in ighoi ambarako etiri 'got extremely hungry' and dubo
merna teria bekQ erira ' is totally overwhelmed by grief , it is certainly a third person
singular form with which the verb could agree.
2. Viewing an unspecified external stimulus as the subject would scarcely be feasible if
there were no cases where a stimulus is specified. However, in example 4.63, a stimulus is
specified. The flounder's biting the narrator is the external stimulus provoking the vexation
Cedric Moghara reported in the story from which 4.63 is taken.

' (The flounder) bit (me), and it greatly upset (me), and I got a knife, poked,
slashed, and generally severed the (mesh connections of my) fish net.'
In this case the stimulus would be treated similarly to the way the initial event in clause
sequences encoding completive aspect is treated. In example 4.63b the subject of dadabetiri
'it finished' is the event,furu dighero 'they lashed the fence'.

they occur.","[147, 148, 149]"
"The following hierarchy indicates the accessibility of semantic arguments to being the
syntactic subject from most accessible to least accessible: AGENT > FORCE > EXPERIENCER
> PATIENT > OBJECT/THEME. As can be seen from the examples, N Ps with AGENT and
FORCE role function as syntactic subjects. But NPs with FORC E role must be marked with
{ imi} to indicate that they are in control of the event encoded. And when N Ps that are
instruments occur in a clause with an N P having AGENT role, they have circumstantial
I N S T R U M EN T role (see § 3 .2.2.2) rather than participatory F O R C E role. NPs with
EXPERIENCER role can function as syntactic subj ect of both transitive ( 3 . 7 3 ) and
intransitive verbs (3 .72) and syntactic object (3 . 7 1 ) . But those with PATIENT role can
function only as syntactic subject of intransitive verbs or syntactic obj ect. N Ps with
OBJECT/THEME role function as syntactic obj ect in transitive clauses or as the entity about
which something is predicated in stative predications (see §4.2). The LOCUS can never be
syntactic subject.
3 .2.2.2 CIRCUMSTANTIAL SEMANTIC ROLESC ircumstantial arguments are marked by eight postpositions. Three usually mark
relationships between NPs. They are:Chapter 390the comitative dual-manner ghae/gae 'with'
the comitative plural
'with'

da
'of, belonging to'Examples illustrating how these three arguments relate NPs are given above in §3 . 1 . 1 and
§3 . 1 .4. Some NPs marked with COMITATIVE postpositions relate to the predicate, indicating
manner (e.g. dubo jamaghae 'cheerfully (lit. neck warm with) ') or temporal arguments (e.g.
sifoghae ' mornings' , tumbaghae 'evenings ', sifode 'tomorrow' , tumbade ' last night').
Postpositions that more regularly relate to the predicate are :

"SRCs203In the story surrounding example 6.46, two egrets attempt to fly a turtle to a new
watering place. The egrets each hold on to a long log (faragho ghousa), one on each end.
The parallel clauses refer to the egrets by the modifier set eini . . . eini 'the one . . . the other' .
The location on the log where each of the egrets bite is mentioned as mendo sovenida 'at
one end' in the first clause and sovenida 'at the other (end)' in the second clause. The verb
gambudo 'bite' is gapped in the initial clause.

The NPs manifesting subject and object in the first clause are usually more complex than
those manifesting the same constituents in the second clause. In example 6.47, the subject
of the first clause is the pronominal copy ne 'they' of the theme gegenembo etoto 'two
men' . The subject of the second clause is j ust the numeric quantifier etoto. The object of
both clauses is muni soveni ' primary dance leader on one side ' . A further indication of the
dual clausal status is the use of the conj unction kotugo ' and likewise', which conjoins
clauses, not NPs .

The occurrence of a final verb terminating an SRC within a longer discourse signals the
end of a sequence of integrated actions. It often sigrials also a break in iconic ordering. In
order to resume the iconically ordered narrative or procedural explanation of the previous
SRC, the speaker repeats or paraphrases a terminal portion of that SRC. This recapitulation,16The fJ symbol i n examples in this section replaces the gapped medial verb.","[222, 223]"
"370Chapter 1 0the discourse rules that apply. This section focuses on scripts 1 7 and the role they play in the
cognitive organisation of meaning.
As part of their theory that human ""memory is organised around personal experiences
(episodes) rather than around abstract semantic categories"" (p. 1 7), Schank and Abelson
( 1 977: 1 1 , 1 7- 1 8, 3 6-45) posit the concept of scripts. In their view, a script is ""a
predetermined, stereotyped sequence of actions that defines a well-known situation"" (p.4 1 ).
It covers several similar episodes and can be economically stored in the memory. The script
is a convenient tool, like a template in a computer program, that can be manipulated to suit
the speaker' s purposes. Scripts are conceptual constructs that get instantiated in the stories
speakers tell and authors write.
Schank and Abelson appear to extend their definition of ' script' beyond a mental
construct to discourse structure rules which specify the things to be said and the order in
which they must be said. They view scripts as rule-ordered causal chains in which each new
action must be completed satisfactorily before the next action in the sequence. They
maintain that scripts are composed of ""slots and requirements about what can fill the slots.
The structure is an interconnected whole and what is in one slot affects what can be in
another . . . Scripts allow for new references to objects within them just as if these objects had
been previously mentioned; obj ects within a script may take 'the' without explicit
introduction because the script itself has already implicitly introduced them . . . A script must
be written from one particular role' s point of view"". It is probably more accurate to
associate discourse structure rules with what Schank and Abelson call 'script application' . 1 8
The information i n this section i s garnered from linguistic representations o f scripts (or
script applications) in Korafe. Schank's and Abelson' s outline of the components
associated with scripts is utilised to discuss what appear to be some of the Korafe scripts. In
addition to the event sequence that is the backbone of the script, the roles the actors assume,
props, preconditions, and results are also associated with the script. Mechanisms must also
exist for invoking a script (termed ' headers' ) and for recovering steps left out in the
particular account (termed 'script appliers').
For example, a restaurant script can be activated by mentioning a header such as the
word ' restaurant' and a precondition header such as ' Susie was hungry' . Roles associated
with a restaurant script include the waiter, the cook, the patron, the cashier, and the owner.","[389, 390]"
"34In order to categorise these nominal + verb complex expressions as either lexemes or products of
syntactic rules, one must determine what constitutes the lexicon. According to Pawley ( 1 985 : 86,
1 986:98-1 04, 1 1 6), grammarians and lexicographers differ in their conceptualisation of the lexicon. The
grammarians' lexicon ""contains all and only the unpredictable pairings of form and meaning, i.e.
morphemes and various sorts of idioms"". The lexicographers' lexicon includes ""any composite form if it
is a common usage, i.e. it if is recognised by members of the language community as a standard way of
referring to a familiar concept or conceptual situation"". The lexicographers' conceptualisation is
preferred in this work.",[86]
"Personal pronouns and interrogative-indefinites with FOCUS function must be marked when

this argument coincides with the subject, because the unmarked order of constituents in
Korafe verbal clauses is SOY . This unmarked order mirrors the inherent natural flow of
attention from agent initiator to patient goal/recipient, according to Delancey ( 1 98 1 :6323
635) ? The Korafe assume that SOY order is operative in clauses like the one in example

"The negative focus marker jo is missing from the above example; just the negative deverbal
gatae 'not select' occurs. When there is a strong possibility that the non-event can be
reversed, the jo can be omitted. The speaker selected a song and sang it immediately after
the words given in example 6.23 were uttered.
The combination (negative deverbal + iri medial form) provides a strategy for
circumventing the iconic order restriction that SRCs adhere to. It is acceptable to say in
Korafe, while x still remained not having happened, before that . . In example 6.24, a
simultaneous medial form is j uxtaposed with a temporal conj unction that encodes
anteriority.
.",[212]
"CHAPTER 2
KORAFE VERBSKorafe verbs function as the only obligatory constituent in clauses or simple sentences,
usually occurring clause-finally.
Verb forms can be distinguished at three levels of structural complexity reflecting the
number and kind of affixes: stem, non-finite forms, and finite forms with absolute or
relative tense markers. From the perspective of syntactic function, these stems, non-finite
and finite forms are used as predicating verbs in two basic sentence types termed by
Longacre ( 1 985 :258) ""co-ranking"" and ""chaining"" sentences.
Korafe co-ranking sentences are made up of clauses with predicating verbs at the same
level of structural complexity: finite verb forms with absolute tense markers. Chaining
structures commonly manifest verbs with differing levels of structural complexity, internal
verbs being less finite or temporally specified than the terminal verb. Stems are the basic
non-final verbal components of serial verb chaining constructions (svcs). Both non-finite
and finite verb forms with relative tense markers terminate internal clauses in switch­
reference constructions (SRCs). Verbs occurring as non-final components of SRCs are called
medial verbs because of their ipso facto distribution sentence-medially and their general
inability to function as isolated utterances. SRCs manifest the same iconic order as
the events they represent and track the salient referent in tense-iconically ordered
discourses.
The terms marking clause and reference clause (Haiman and Munro 1 983 :xii) are used
to facilitate the description of interclausal relationships in SRCs in Korafe. Marking clauses
precede reference clauses and use reference clauses as their standard of temporal and
referential comparison. A medial verb terminating a marking clause is marked to indicate
that the event it represents precedes (sequencing: SEQ) or overlaps with (simultaneous: SIM)
the event expressed by the reference clause. The medial verb in the marking clause also
signals coreferentiality of subject (marked ss) or shift of subj ect reference (marked D S)
between the two clauses. Reference clauses serve as marking clauses for subsequent
adjacent clauses in S RCs, except for SRC terminal reference clauses which terminate with
final verbs.","[40, 41]"
"384Chapter 1 1Thus, medial verbs which constitute the majority o f the bases o f SRCs are the primary
indicators of temporal sequentiality and adjacency in Korafe. Although the notion of
foregrounding correlates with independent clause syntax in much of the literature (Hopper
1 979b:2 1 6; Labov 1 972 :362) and medial verbs are syntactically dependent, SRCs and other
chaining structures demonstrate many of the characteristics attributed to foregrounded
narrative text.
( 1 ) The clauses in an SRC cannot be reversed in order without changing the semantic
interpretation of the text.
(2) Sequencing medial verbs manifest strict tense-iconic sequencing in which each
represented event must be completed before the subsequent event commences.
(3) Clause components of SRCs relate events that are indispensable to the narrative; the
story would be incoherent if one only considered the independent final verbs to be
fore grounded event-line.
(4) Most of the subjects refer to human entities and are clearly identified.
Therefore, chaining structures (SYCS, SRCS, chaining paragraphs) are considered to
encode foreground information.
Action is suspended in discourse in order to provide background information,
""secondary information that is used to clarify the narrative."" (Grimes 1 975 :56) In Korafe
narratives, background information is often signalled by discrepancies in the switch­
reference tracking system, which were outlined in Chapter 7. Some background infomation,
called ' off-line background' in this thesis, encodes states and events that do not fit
temporally within the event sequence encoded by the main event-line. However, there is
another category of background that dovetails temporally with events belonging to the main
event line. 3 These are coded by a mismatch in subject referencing between marking and
reference clauses in Korafe are termed 'on-line background' . They encode physiological
and emotional responses, temporal, meteorological and circumstantial settings, and the
semi-coterminous activities of two sets of participants as seen from the viewpoint of one of
the sets.
Texts express only one event at a time. Therefore, tracking the separate but simultaneous
activities of the participants of two independent events poses problems for maintaining
action continuity in SRCs. Acknowledging this problem, Hopper ( 1 979b:39, 6 1 ) and others
have suggested that an event marked as simultaneous with another event is a backgrounded
event.
As mentioned above, when the participant' s actions overlap, the Korafe often present
one participant' s activities as foregrounded events and the other' s as on-line background,
perceived from the foregrounded participant's viewpoint. (Examples can be found in §7.3 .3.)Thompson ( 1 987:445-448) also notes that some temporally sequenced clauses in English should not be
called foreground. She believes that those subordinate clauses that are ""on the time line are doing other
discourse work in addition to naming a temporally sequenced event"", such as orienting another event
back to the ongoing temporal line and interpreting events in their order of importance.","[403, 404]"
"Chapter 72287.3 'MISMATCHED' CLAUSES IN THE SRCApparent anomalies in subject referencing occur between marking and reference clauses
that are base constituents of SRCs. In these cases, the initial marking clause indicates that
the following reference clause shares the same subject referent, but the reference clause
does not, in fact, have the same subject referent. The expected and actual patterns are
diagrammed below. For ease of reference, the initial marking clause is labelled S 1 and the
reference clause S2.
EXPECTED (or CANONICAL):
S I (SUBJECT=i DS S2 (SUBJECT=j)DSACTUAL :
S I (SUBJECT=i)DSWhat actually occurs is the following pattern.
SS S 2(SUBJECT=j)Although ellipsis of NP arguments is quite common in SRCs, S2 either has an overt subject
NP or the subject is uniquely recoverable.
I will refer to such cases as exhibiting 'mismatching' between marking and reference
clauses. Unlike the embedded skipped sentences which do not obligatorily maintain tense
iconicity, these mismatched clauses are either ordered to maintain the temporal iconicity of
the events they reference in the event sequence the SRC represents, or indicate overlap of
one event with two other events that are represented in iconic order. This means that a
mismatched clause cannot be reversed with the clause before or after it.
Mismatched constructions are associated with three types of clauses in Korafe: ( 1 )
mismatched clauses that encode physiological and psychological responses, (2) mismatched
clauses that provide a temporal, meteorological or circumstantial setting for a subsequent
segment of the SRC, and (3) mismatched clauses that register a temporal overlap between
marking and reference clauses. 1 0
7.3 . 1 MISMATCHES INV OLV ING PHYSIOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSESIn §4.4.3 , two distinct options that the Korafe have for encoding emotional responses
were discussed. They are illustrated by examples 4.62 and 4.63, which are repeated here as

"212Chapter 6The 55 subject guideline (G-l):In a sequence of clauses predicated by ss medial verbs, the initial subject, which is
referenced by an N P in the first clause l 8 or is understood from the context, persists as
subject throughout the sequence.
In example 6.68, each verb is a SS medial form. Together these verbs track the activities
of the noarovetu ' wife', referenced by an overt NP only in the first clause.

' . . . his wife became deliriously happy, moved from the stern, ran and came

Other overt NPs function as objects: riria ambari eko ava 'great hilarity' and nuvembo
Motan ' her husband, Motan' , or objects of pps: ghaemboda 'at the stern' and gitida ' to the
bow' .
The 0-7S guideline (G-3) : 1 9The object N P in a marking clause predicated by a DS sequencing medial verb is
interpreted as the subject of the reference clause, provided that the reference clause is
predicated by a verb that agrees in person and number with this NP and contains no overt
core NP of its own.
In example 6.70 the subject, nane 'it is 1 ' , and object, nunda beD ' her hair' , are identified
and maintained as subj ect and object in the second clause by the ss medial verb of the first
clause. But the medial verb in the second clause is marked for switch of subject, and the
object of clause 2 is interpreted as the subject of clause 3 .

jaredo ' despairing') predicates the initial clause in a clause sequence predicated by ss verbs, the
subject NP for the series follows the perception verb. This NP functions as a thematic P2 argument or as
the subject of the subsequent clause, marking the onset of the next TCCU.
The numbering of these guidelines follows the order set up in § 1 1 .2.4.4 where a more complete set of
tracking guidelines are provided.","[231, 232]"

"9.2. 1 FIXED AND SEMIPRODUCTIVE SPEECH FORMULASFixed speech formulas (formulas that do not vary in lexical content or word order) in
Korafe are exemplified by the greeting Sifo eveva! 'Good day ! (lit. day good)' , a calque on
the English expression. Fixed formulas used for expressing gratitude are: A iyakoe!
'Thanks ! ' and A iyakoe bekti resena! ' Thank you very much! ' . The telling of a legend
begins with the fixed formula Kiki! ' Story ! ' and Kiki aghata bamba! 'tall tale ! ' concludes
them.
Semiproductive formulas occurring with severe constraints on the variation include both

In order to encode events in their ' real ' or iconic order, SRCs must mark both relative
temporal relationships between events and the absolute temporal and modal relationship
they have with the speech-act situation. 7 Final verbs terminating SRCs express tense-aspect­
mood and the speaker' s modal orientation by means of 1 2 tense-aspect-mood paradigms,
related to the speech-act time. Medial verbs are interpreted as having a 'tense' relative to
the tense of the subsequent verb. Thus, each event signalled by a medial verb in the SRC is
oriented to the speech-act situation by its mediated or direct relationship with the final verb.
(The morphological forms of all the verbs listed in this section are presented in detail in
Chapter 2.)
A we ll-defined system of tense sequencing or concord rules governs the
correspondences between these medial and final sets. Any SS medial verb (other than
durative sequencing SS forms) can occur with final verbs marked for any tense or mood.
Example 2.34a-c illustrating tense correspondences with a same subject medial verb is
repeated below as 6.4a-c.

one in a set. Two sets of pronouns have pragmatic FOCUS function: ( 1 ) the exclusive focal
actor set with -ne and the (2) exclusive focal experiencer set with -mo+a. Like { imi} , the
exclusive focal actor personal pronoun set (nane ' I myself, nine 'you, yourself , nune 'he
himself , and nene ' they themselves') marks its referent as the specific initiator of the
action encoded by the verbal predicate. However, unlike { im i } , this set is restricted to
clause-internal function, as syntactic subject, semantic AGENT, and pragmatic FOCUS. This
set must be used when a personal pronoun has subject function in an osv-ordered clause.

to interpreting who is doing what when there are no overt NPs expounding the syntactic
arguments in clauses. 1 1 These four syntactic tracking rules operative in SRCs are repeated
below with formulas showing subject and object reference. The following notations are
used: C l oSS stands for clause 1 predicated by a SS medial verb; CloDS for clause 1 predicated
by a os medial verb, S=i for the referent of the subject is i, O=j for the referent of the object
is j, IO=j for the referent of the indirect object is j, etc.

subject throughout the series.

' My canoe the sea waves took hold of, swelled over, held fast, and dashed to

the canoe in iconic order. However, the lack of temporal specification allows for the
encoding of events that totally overlap as well as events in sequence. Each pair of adjacent
verbs in this SVC encodes objective events that could conceivably overlap totally with each
other. That means, for instance, that feunghe ' (waves) swell over into the canoe' could have
been positioned before bu ' acquire control over' . However, the speaker assigned the order
given above to the four events. (In many serial verb sequences, the speaker does not need to
assign the order; it is standardised and available for his or her use.) The lack of explicit
temporal marking on verbs in SVCS allows discrepancies between objective order and the
speaker's depiction of events. Because event junctures in SVCs are indistinctly defined, the
speaker can weld the entire sequence of events represented by the SVC into an integrated
unit. 44In the early 1 970s when my husband and I first encountered these Korafe constructions, we called the
verb stems integral action verb forms to indicate the unspecified, but integrated nature of the bond
holding the verbs together in the construction.",[178]
"Although the obj ect often persists in its role over a chain of same-subject medial verbs
until another one takes its place, a topic NP can take precedence in the chain. In example
6.75, the NP rika emo ' (regarding) this bird' is marked with a demonstrative and the topic
marker mo and introduced as the initial object in the SS clause chain. Another unmarked NP,
buroro 'feathers' , is the object of tusedo 'pluck'. However, it would be nonsensical to
regard the 'feathers' as also being the object of the verbs oje itido ' butcher and cook', so it
is safe to assume that the speaker intends the topic NP rika emo ' (regarding) this bird' to be
understood as the object.

This S�o shift occurs regularly when the simultaneous D S verb is followed b y a form of
the verb gi ' see' . The writer of the story from which example 6.77 was taken did not know
the Korafe word for ' axe ' : oto . He only knew the loan word from another language:
karivaku. So each time his father sent him back to the house to find the ' oto ' , he saw the
axe but left it, searching frantically for some other item.

shift in example 6.78, it does not affect the shift. The initial clause is marked for a switch of
reference. The first person plural referent marked on the verb in clause 3 is the subject of
both the intransitive verb, yama 'will be going' and the transitive verb jeoro ' we chop ' . The
subject of the initial clause, ambe ' sago tree' , is interpreted to be the object of the third

""Action continuity pertains primarily to temporal sequentiality within [a]
thematic paragraph, but also to temporal adjacency therein.""
(Giv6n, ed. 1 983 : 8)
In Korafe narratives, action continuity is maintained by sequences of clauses that
iconically reflect the temporal order of the actions they represent.
Two hypotheses about action continuity are assumed in this discussion. The first is that:
structures maintaining action continuity convey foregrounded information. Foregrounded
information can be defmed by two criteria:
( 1 ) Foregrounded events are the important, indispensable events of the narrative, those that
constitute its ' skeleton' or ' backbone' . (Wallace 1 982:208-209; Hopper 1 979a:6 1 ,
1 979b:2 1 6 and Hopper and Thompson 1 980:280-28 1 )
(2) Foregrounded clauses are ordered i n temporal sequence. According to Labov and
Waletzky ( 1 966) and Labov ( 1 972:360), a minimal narrative is ""a sequence of two
clauses which are temporally ordered: that is, a change in their order will result in a
change in the temporal sequence of the original semantic interpretation"".
The second hypothesis is that: chaining structures convey foregrounded information in
Korafe. SRCS are the primary indicators of temporal sequentiality and adjacency in Korafe.","[402, 403]"

All classifier + noun sequences are a distinctive group differentiated from both NPs and
other nominal compounds by their accent which falls on the inherently stressed syllable of
the classifier constituent, not on the terminal constituent. Both innovative and lexicalised
classifier + nominal compounds manifest the following four characteristics of compound
nominal heads. ( 1 ) They must occur j uxtaposed in fixed order with no words or pauses
intervening. (2) Some of them can be inflected for plurality as a unit. (3) The classifying
modifiers in these compounds do not occur in headless NPs. (Modifiers that are
unambiguously NP constituents occur in headless NPs, as discussed in §3 . 1 .2.) (4) These
classifying modifiers cannot be intensified; post-head modifiers in NPs can be.",[91]
