"Grammatically speaking, the order of modifiers in relation to the head noun
is rather free; constituents in a noun phrase can be scrambled to any order and still
be grammatical (except for certain genitive phrases with ellipted genitive clitic, in
which case the genitive phrase must precede the head noun; §4.5.3). However, there
are tendencies as to whether a modifier precedes or follows the head noun:4
•Relative clauses nearly always precede head nouns;•There is a weak tendency of possessive phrases being placed in front
of the head noun;•Demonstratives are nearly always at the left or right edge of the noun
phrase;•There are weak tendencies for non-numeral quantifiers and lower
numerals (‘three’ and below) to follow the head noun;•Adjectives (§3.1.2) tend to be closer to the head noun than other noun
modifiers within the same noun phrase; adjectives which denote
dimensions (e.g. bukwa ‘big’, tikyawi ‘small’, blufa ‘short’) tend to
follow the head noun; other adjectives tend to may precede the head
noun.",[212]
"258Intraclausal syntax plays a minor role in Menggwa Dla. Most clauses are
verb-final, and the order amongst the free constituents (noun phrases and other
words) before the verb is free. Nevertheless, one constituent can occupy the postverbal position; this constituent further specifies the identity of a reference
mentioned earlier in the clause (or sometimes in previous clauses). These postverbal constituents form the same intonation domain with the rest of the clause in
front of it, and these post-verbal constituents can express either old or new
information; hence these post-verbal constituents are not manifestations of rightdislocation or anti-topics in their prototypical sense. See §5.4 on intraclausal syntax.","[272, 273]"
"When used as a modifier to a head noun, the genitive phrase usually precedes
the head noun (see §4.3 on word order within noun phrases).",[229]
"Clauses often consist of a single verb or a single serial verb construction;
clauses need not have any (pro)nominals. The following are some examples of
clauses with no (pro)nominals: the verb in examples 5-135 and 5-136 are
independent verbs (§6), and the verb in examples 5-137 and 5-138 are chain verbs

sometimes gender categories (e.g. yoambo (1SG:OBJ) ‘me’), are used for objects
(§4.6.2). Otherwise, subject noun phrases are zero case-marked, and object noun325phrases take an optional object case clitic =mbo (§4.5.1; §5.3.1). In the following
examples, the subject nominal precedes the object nominal. The order of the subject
and the object nominals can be interchanged freely with no change in pragmatic
status and semantics.5-141. hilari ufatisimi-Ø-hya.","[338, 339, 340]"
"We have seen in §5.4 that intraclausal syntax play a minor role in Menggwa
Dla. Clauses are most usually verb-final, and the order of the constituents in front
of the clause is free. Some clauses have one constituent after the verb; this postverbal constituent give further information towards a reference mentioned earlier in
the clause or earlier in the discourse. However, this is not a manifestation of rightdislocation or anti-topic in their prototypical sense, as the post-verbal constituent
form a single intonation domain with the rest of the clause in front of it, and the
post-verbal constituent can express either new or old information.",[348]
"198The following are some examples of complex noun phrases which may or
may not follow the word-order tendencies outlined above. It is grammatical to
scramble the order of a head noun and its modifying phrases to any order, hence it is
impossible for noun phrases with three or more constituents to consist of hierarchies
of binary noun phrases. The noun modifiers are in bold in the following examples.4-23. [imbumamo

the components in a noun compound are fixed. Endocentric noun compounds are
always right-headed. A modified noun phrase differs from a noun compound in its
pitch pattern (§2.4.2): in a modified noun phrase, each component has its own pitch
domain (e.g. [[MH…]NP MH…]NP), whereas noun compounds are covered by a
single pitch domain (e.g. [MHH….]NP pitch pattern) (see also examples in §3.1.2).","[212, 213, 214, 215]"
"A noun phrase can be encliticised by a case clitic, and/or a topic or focus
clitic (§4.5). Menggwa Dla has a range of semantic case clitics, with the local cases
having an internal versus external distinction. A head noun and its modifiers must
be contiguous with each other to form a noun phrase. However, within a noun
phrase, the word order is basically free (§4.3). Proper names in Menggwa Dla are
not morphologically distinguished from common nouns (§4.4).",[20]
"4.3Noun modifiers,
modifiers, word order in NP and noun compounds
Noun phrases can be clearly identified in Menggwa Dla, as the head nounand its modifiers are always contiguous to each other. The syntactic positions of
nominal clitics (§4.5) also testify to the existence of noun phrases — nominal clitics
have the last independent word in a noun phrase as their host.4-22. [wulibukwa imbu=mbi/[house bigtwo=PROP/wuli imbu bukwa=mbi] ni-wi.

"Intraclausal syntax does not play a large role in Menggwa Dla (§5.4).
Clauses are predominantly verb-final; phrases in front of the verb can be scrambled
to any order. Sometimes a focused phrase can be placed after the verb.",[23]

be adjacent to the head noun, as shown in the following example. In the following
example, the head noun hwafo ‘talk’ is modified by two modifiers: the genitive
phrase amamo=la ‘of the moon’ and the relative clause hohohiahya ‘which they
told’. The order of modifiers within a noun phrase is grammatically free (§4.3); the
head noun and its modifiers can be in any order within the noun phrase.7-24. [[hoho-hi-a-hya]amamo=la hwafo

subjects and objects are often expressed only as cross-reference suffixes, sometimes
the position relativised can be ambiguous. In the following example, the relative
clause hombaihya can either mean ‘who [saw him]’ or ‘whom [you/ he saw]’; ifhombaihya is an independent clause, it would mean ‘you/he saw him’. Also

Copula is a special class of verb in Menggwa Dla. Like other verbs, copulasalso have finite forms which carry cross-referencing and non-finite forms which do
not. However, as the main verb of a clause, finite copulas only head independent
clauses (§6), and the non-finite copulas only head non-finite chain clauses (§7.3.2)
(copulas are not used as the main verb of subordinate clauses (§7.1) and chain
clauses (§7.2); see also §6.4.3 on auxiliary copulas). Moreover, finite copulas mark
less tense-aspect-mood categories than ordinary verbs, and the way tense-aspectmood-polarity categories are expressed in copulas is also mostly different from those

"THE MENGGWA DLA LANGUAGE
OF NEW GUINEAHILÁRIO DE SOUSAA thesis submitted in fulfilment of
the requirements for the degree of
Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Linguistics
University of SydneyNovember 2006Abstract
Menggwa Dla is a Papuan language spoken in Sandaun Province of Papua
New Guinea and Kabupaten Jayapura of Papua Province, Indonesia. Menggwa Dla is a
dialect of the Dla language; together with its sister language Anggor (e.g. Litteral
1980), the two languages form the Senagi language family, one of the small Papuan
language families found in North-Central New Guinea.
The main text of this thesis is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1
introduces the linguistic, cultural and political landscapes of the Indonesia-Papua
New Guinea border area where the Dla territory is located. Chapter 2 introduces the
phonology of Menggwa Dla; described in this chapter are the phonemes, allophonic
variations, phonotactics, morpho-phonological processes, stress assignment and
intonation of the language. The inventory of phonemes in Menggwa is average for a
Papuan language (15 consonants and 5 vowels). The vast majority of syllables come
in the shape of V, CV or C1C2V where C2 can be /n/ /r/ /l/ /j/ or /w/. In C1C2V
syllables, the sonority rises from C1 to V (§2.2.2). Nevertheless, there are a few
words with word-medial consonant sequences like ft /ɸt/, lk /lk/, lf /lɸ/ or lk /lk/
where the sonority drops from the first to the second consonant; the first consonant
in these sequences is analysed as the coda of the previous syllable (§2.2.3).
Chapter 3 is an overview of the word classes in Menggwa Dla; the
morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of the three major word classes
(nouns, adjectives and verbs) and the minor word classes are compared in this
chapter. Chapter 4 describes the properties of nouns and noun phrases; the personnumber-gender categories, noun-phrasal syntax, nominal clitics and personal
pronouns are outlined in this chapter. Menggwa Dla has a rich array of case, topic
and focus markers which comes in the form of clitics (§4.5). Subject pronouns
(‘citation pronouns’) only mark person (i.e. one for each of the three persons),
whereas object and genitive pronouns mark person (including inclusive/exclusive
first person), number, and sometimes also gender features (§4.6).
Chapter 5 introduces various morphological and syntactic issues which are
common to both independent and dependent clauses: verb stems, verb classes,iicross-referencing, intraclausal syntax, syntactic transitivity and semantic valence.
Cross-referencing in Menggwa Dla is complex: there are seven paradigms of subject
cross-reference suffixes and four paradigms of object cross-references. Based on
their cross-referencing patterns, verbs are classified into one of five verb classes
(§5.2). There is often a mismatch between the number of cross-reference suffixes,
the semantic valence, and the syntactic transitivity within a clause. There are verbs
where the subject cross-reference suffix, or the object suffix, or both the subject and
object suffixes are semantically empty (‘dummy cross-reference suffixes’; §5.3.2).
Chapter 6 outlines the morphology of independent verbs and copulas.
Verbal morphology differs greatly between the three statuses of realis, semi-realis
and irrealis; a section is devoted to the morphology for each of the three statuses.
Chapter 7 introduces the dependent clauses and verbal noun phrases. Different
types of dependent verbs are deverbalised to various degrees: subordinate verbs are
the least deverbalised, chain verbs are more deverbalised (but they mark switchreference (SR), and sometimes also interclausal temporal relations), and non-finite
chain verbs even more deverbalised. Further deverbalised than the non-finite chain
verbs are the verbal nouns; verbal noun phrases in Menggwa Dla functions
somewhat like complement clauses in English.
In younger speakers speech, the function of the chain clause SR system has
diverted from the canonical SR system used by older speakers (§7.2.2). For younger
speakers, coreferential chain verb forms and disjoint-reference chain verb forms
only have their coreferential and disjoint-referential meaning — respectively —
when the person-number-gender features of the two subject cross-reference
suffixes cannot resolve the referentiality of the two subjects. Otherwise, the
coreferential chain verb forms have become the unmarked SR-neutral chain verb
forms.
At the end of this thesis are appendix 1, which contains four Menggwa Dla
example texts, and appendix 2, which contains tables of cross-reference suffixes,
pronouns, copulas and irregular verbs.iiiTable of contents

During these few years I have been so focused in my research that I have
unknowingly neglected a lot of people who have gone out of their way to help me
achieve my goals. I feel ashamed at not always able to reciprocate the assistance
given to me. I thank you all for helping me, and I sincerely apologise for not being
able to list the names of everyone whom I would like to thank here.
First of all, this thesis would not have existed without the help of the Dla
people. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all Dla people for their
generosity in sharing with me their beautiful language and culture. In particular, I
would like to thank my main language teachers: Donald Yawa, David Yawa, †Simon
Kore and Stanis Kore.
I would like to thank the Department of Education of Sandaun Province, the
Indonesian consulate in Vanimo and the Papua New Guinean consulate in Jayapura
(especially Sephy Rollo) for their assistance. I have been looked after by the
Catholic hierarchy everywhere in New Guinea. I would like to thank Bishop Cesare
Bonivento PIME of Vanimo, Fr. မာေတးအုိ Matteo Joi and Fr. Pepito Estaniel MSP who
were the parish priests at Kamberatoro, the Passionists in Vanimo and Port Moresby
(in particular, Br. Jerome Dunn CP and Br. James Coucher CP who spent most of
their lives in New Guinea helping people of the border region), Kevin and Gail and
others at Dovair in Vanimo, and Jaap van der Werf in Jayapura. I would also like to
thank BJ Kim, Danny Lim, Kirsten Bishop and Peter Lockey etc. for looking after me
in Port Moresby.
I would like to show my deepest appreciation to my supervisors William
Foley and Jane Simpson at University of Sydney. I am very fortunate to have them
as my supervisors. Their strengths complemented each other, and I have learnt
from them valuable academic skills. (Any shortcomings in this thesis are of cause
my own fault.) Their encouragements led me in constantly trying to improve the
quality of my research. Other than academic support, Bill also funded most of my
fieldtrips to New Guinea. ཐགས་ེ་ཆེ་གནང།xI would like to thank Toni Borowsky at University of Sydney and Elaine
Ballard at University of Auckland for going through several incarnations of the
phonology chapter with me. Talking with Doug Marmion at Australian National
University about his fieldwork experiences in Sandaun Province was most helpful. I
would like to thank Robert and Shirley Litteral for their amazing insights of the
Anggor language (not a lot of people get to work on a language with just one sister
language).
I also owe gratitude to Alexandra Aikhenvald at La Trobe University,
Frantisek Lichtenberk at University of Auckland, Mark Donohue at Monash
University, Michael Walsh at University of Sydney, George van Driem at Universiteit
Leiden, Matthew Dryer at State University of New York, Lesley Stirling at University
of Melbourne and Mark Harvey at University of Newcastle and for many stimulating
discussions in linguistics and life in general. In addition, Lesley has — on many
occasions — directly or indirectly introduced me to some of the most interesting
pieces of research by various top-quality linguists (including herself), often on
linguistic issues which I knew very little about.
It has been inspiring talking to — and in some cases reading the thesis of —
the following linguistic people currently or previously at University of Sydney: Ilana
Mushin, Ikuko Nakane, Linda Barwick, Debra Aarons, John Gibbons, Ahmar
Mahboob, James Martin, Aet Lees, I Wayan Arka, Bill Palmer, Brett Baker, Andrew
Ingram, Johnson Welem Haan, Lea Brown, Barbara Jones, Zeid Al-Dakkan, Nicoletta
Romeo, Carmel O’Shannessy, JoAnne Page, Kamaludin Yusra, St.John Skilton, Adam
Blaxter-Paliwala, Jackie Chang, Miriam Corris, Melissa Crowther, Lila San Roque,
Myfany Turpin, Louise de Beuzeville, Talia Gill, Claire Hill, Matthew & Donna
Toulmin, Joseph Blythe, Amanda Oppliger, Chong Han, Winnie Chor, Marie Fellbaum
Korpi, Bronwyn Dyson, Derek Herforth, Nerida Jarkey, Ian Smith, Tom Honeyman,
Fiona Blake, Aiden Wilson, James McElvenny, Rebecca Defina and Anthony Phillips.
(Sorry if I have missed anyone.)
Other academics I would like to thank include Mike Moxness at SIL Sentani,
Eileen Gasaway at SIL Ukarumpa, Wiem Burung at SIL Kangaroo Ground; HelenxiCharters, Fay Wouk, Ross Clark, Donna Starks, †Scott Allan, Andreea Calude, Andy
Gibson, Edward McDonald (谢谢), Harumi Minagawa (有難う御座います) and
Wayne Lawrence (一杯御拝でーびるさい) at University of Auckland; Nick Evans,
Nick Thieberger, Sebastian Fedden and Robyn Loughnane at University of
Melbourne; Tonya Stebbins at La Trobe University, Andrew Pawley, Malcolm Ross,
John Bowden, Carol Priestley, Jason Lee, Pascale Jacq and Antoinette Schapper at
Australian National University; and Ritsuko Kikusawa & Lawrence Reid who
constantly float between various institutions in the world.
I would also like to thank Virginia Mayger, Eugene Chan, Mary Yew, Maria
Cortes, Brett Millar, Daniel Haggard and other administrative staff at the University
of Sydney for their continuous help with all the things that I do not want to deal
with on my own.
I owe my life to Alfredo F.X. de Souza, Chi-Peng Ieong, Antónia de Sousa and
Joana de Sousa. Without their continuous support I would not have reached this far.
Obrigado and 多謝 from the bottom of my heart. Amongst all my relatives whom I
would to thank (sorry, I am not able to name them all; I have too many relatives), I
would like to say 多謝 to my cousin Winnie Lok-Yin Yeung for putting me up and
letting me bother her in Brisbane many times on my way to and from New Guinea.
(I hope you like the presents I bought you in Jayapura or Port Moresby.)
Peter Withers sacrificed a lot in order to help me. Amongst the endless list
of things I want to thank him for are: a) creating a solar-panel-charging-device to
power my computer in New Guinea; b) guiding me in computer graphics; and c)
making me laugh. Also having my love are Barbara Machin, Rev. David Withers,
Catherine Withers, Tim Wright, Stellar Wright and Chester Wright in South
Australia who support me unconditionally.
Finally, I may not be very religious, but I am deeply theistic. I thank Tuhan
Allah for everything.xiiAbbreviations and conventions

transitional aspect (inchoative or completive aspect)In the Menggwa Dla examples, cross-reference suffixes with the gloss ‘:O’ are object
cross-reference suffixes, whereas cross-reference suffixes without the gloss ‘:O’ are
subject cross-reference suffixes. For instance, in the verb ser-iha-hwa (eat-1SG-PAST)
‘I ate’, -iha (1SG) is the subject cross-reference suffix; in the verb bi-wu-a-hwa (holdN1MPL-3FSG:O-PAST) ‘they hold it’, -wu (-N1MPL) is the subject cross-reference suffix,
and -a (3FSG:O) is the object cross-reference suffix. See §5.2 on cross-referencing in
Menggwa Dla.xivChapter 1IntroductionThis thesis is primarily a description of the phonology, morphology and
syntax of the Menggwa dialect of the Dla language, a Papuan language spoken on
both sides of the vertical 141°E borderline between Papua New Guinea and Papua
Province of Indonesia (also known as Papua Barat West Papua)1 at around 3°40′S,
about a hundred kilometres inland from the northern coast. There are two dialects of
Dla: Menggwa Dla is the minority dialect, and it is spoken by around 200 people;
the majority dialect, which I call Dla proper, has around 1000 speakers. The ‘×’ in
map 1.1 below shows the approximate centre point of Dla territory in New Guinea.
(see also map 1.2 in §1.2.1 and map 1.14 in §1.4.4).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"
".photo=ADS see-1SG-3FSG:O-PAST‘I saw my face in the photo.’ (50II)First of all, notice that the object is expressed as a third person entity;
expressing both the subject and the object as first person is simply not possible in
Menggwa Dla. Secondly, the word ahu indicates that there is a possessive relation
between two grammatical relations in the clause (based on the semantics, the objecthombafluma ‘face’ is possessed by the subject yo ‘I’), but the word ahu is not part
of the object noun phrase hombafluma(=mbo) ‘face(=OBJ)’. This can be
established by the fact that the word ahu can exist in positions which are explicitly
not within any case-marked phrases:4-170. yo hombafluma(=mbo) foto=hi
1face(=OBJ)ahu homba-ha-a-hwa.",[268]
"2524-168. afilahwilara=nadofoheli=hifather motherDEM=ALL secretefyara=naN1FDU:RSUMPDEM=ALL go-DR-N1FDU-DEPo naho=nambodance=ADS or what=ALLpo-me-efya-mbona,‘Father and mother the two of them went to a secret ceremony or somewhere,
and…’ (A)4.6.4The ‘reflexive’ word ahu
The prototypical notion of reflexivity involves one grammatical positionexpressed as coreferential with another grammatical position within the same clause,
and that the two grammatical positions have different semantic roles. This type of
reflexivity cannot be expressed in Menggwa Dla, i.e. the core and oblique relations
within a clause cannot be coreferential with each other. For example, reflexive
cross-reference suffix combinations — i.e. first person subject with first person
object and second person subject with second person object — do not exist (§5.3.1).
Similarly, if both a subject and an object pronoun (i.e. a citation pronoun (§4.6.1)
and an object case pronoun (§4.6.2) respectively) are used in a clause, they cannot
be both first person or both second person.","[266, 267]"
"Nouns can be modified by various modifiers: adjectives, genitive phrases,
proprietive/ abessive phrases, demonstratives, degree qualifiers, quantifiers and
relative clauses (§4.3). There are no morphological differences between proper
names and common nouns (§4.4). On the noun phrase level there are the numerous
case clitics and other nominal clitics like the topic clitic and focus clitics (§4.5).
Different sets of pronouns are used in different positions (§4.6). There are the
‘citation pronouns’ which are used in topic/ subject positions or in isolation, and
there are only three of them, each marking only a person category: yo first person
(‘I’/ ‘We’), si second person (i.e. ‘you’) and ai third person (‘s/he/it/they’). There
are also the object pronouns, genitive pronouns and subject resumptive pronouns
which have fifteen or sixteen members, each marking different person, number and186gender combinations. These pronouns also mark a distinction of inclusive versus
exclusive first person; nowhere else in Menggwa Dla (and Dla proper) grammar is
the distinction of exclusive versus inclusive first person grammaticalised (see §4.6).","[200, 201]"
"To the north of Dla and Anggor are the languages of the Waris branch of the
Border language family. North of Anggor and northeast of Dla is the Amanab
language (also known as the Awai language to Dla people), the southern most
member of the Border family (e.g. G. Graham 1968, 1980; D. Graham 1969; Minch
1992). Amanab is the language of Amanab Town, the administrative centre of
Amanab District of Sandaun Province in Papua New Guinea. To the north of Dla
and Amanab is the Waina-Sowanda language. To the north of Waina-Sowanda is
Waris (e.g. Brown 1981, 1988). Other languages of the Waris branch include48Manem to the northwest of Waris, Imonda (Seiler 1985), Daonda and Simog to the

Waina-Sowanda.27 Amanab have five vowels /i e a o u/ and fourteen consonants /p t

and twelve consonants /p t k b d ɡ m n l f s h/ (Seiler 1985).28 Both languages mark
tense, aspect and mood by suffixes and/ or pre-verbal particles, and verbs only agree
with the number of the subject. Dual number of the subject is usually indicated by a
prefix to the underived (singular) verb stem, and plural number is most commonly
indicated by raising the last vowel of the verb stem (at least for transitive verbs).
For instance, in Imonda (Seiler 1985: 82):Table 1.15Singular versus plural verb stems in Imondasingularplural (derived)fefi‘made, do’pospus‘dig out’lalæ‘light fire’naglanaglɛ‘see’ɒɔ‘speak, talk’səhsih‘search’And in Amanab (Minch 1992: 107):27Seiler (1985) presents arguments for the separation of Imonda from Waris and Punda from WainaSowanda. In other publications like Laycock (1973), Imonda and Punda are not considered separate
languages.

In Imonda, there is also a trill /r/ phoneme which only occurs in ‘sound words’ (:11). In addition,
in approaching adulthood, young people learn to distinguish /ɨ/ from /i/ and /ʉ/ from /u/ for a
small set of words. For example, for children ‘put’ (plural subject) and ‘lie’ are both /li/; when
approaching adulthood they have to learn that ‘put’ (plural subject) is /li/ and ‘lie’ is ‘lɨ’. Including
these ‘adulthood’ vowels, Imonda has twelve vowel phonemes (Seiler 1985: 20-21).","[62, 63]"

"Overall, grammatical relations in Menggwa Dla are aligned in an accusativesecundative alignment (§5.3.1): intransitive subjects [S] and transitive subjects [A]
are marked similarly (‘subject’), monotransitive objects [P] are marked similarly as
ditransitive first objects [R] (the recipient relation; ‘(first) object’), and ditransitive
second objects [T] (the theme/ ‘gift’ relation) is treated separately. In terms of
cross-referencing, subjects are cross-referenced by subject cross-reference suffixes,
(first) objects are cross-referenced by object cross-reference suffixes, and second
objects are never cross-referenced on the verb. In terms of case marking, (first)
objects can be marked with an object case clitic =mbo (§4.5.1), while subjects and
second objects are zero-case-marked.",[347]

other grammatical relations: only subjects can be the pivots for switch-reference, i.e.

In Menggwa Dla, pronouns are not obligatorily used; clauses often consist ofa single verb which carries at least one cross-reference suffix (§5.4). The personal
pronouns in Menggwa Dla tend to be used only in referring to high animate noun
phrases (e.g. humans, dogs, pigs). There are different types of pronouns. The
simplest of them are the citation pronouns (§4.6.1). There are only three citation
pronouns, one for each person, and number is not distinguished: yo first person
‘I/we’, si second person ‘you’ and ai third person ‘s/he/it/they’. Citation pronouns
are used in positions which cannot be case marked: in isolation, in topic position, or
in subject position. (Ditransitive second objects, i.e. theme/ ‘gift’, are also not cased
marked, but second objects cannot be pronominalised.)3-76. ai=na sista
3=TOP sisterniwi.
COP:N1FPL‘They are nuns.’If the speaker wishes to emphasise the person-number-gender features of the
subject, a subject resumptive pronoun can be used (§4.6.3). Subject resumptive
pronouns are basically independent words in the shape of class IA cross-reference
suffixes (sometimes with minor changes in their phonological shapes; see §5.2.1).
Sometimes a subject resumptive pronoun together with a citation pronoun can
contribute to a finer person specification than a subject resumptive pronoun alone.
For instance, in example 3-77 below, the citation pronoun ai (3) and the subject
resumptive pronoun afa (N1MDU) together give the person-number-gender
153combination of third person masculine dual (3MDU), while the citation pronoun si (2)
and the subject resumptive pronoun afa (N1MDU) together give the person-numbergender combination of second person masculine dual (2MDU). In example 3-78
below, the citation pronoun si (2) and the subject resumptive pronoun efa (1PL)
together indicate inclusive first person, while the citation pronouns yo (1) and the
subject resumptive pronoun efa (1PL) together indicate exclusive first person.
Citation pronouns on their own or subject resumptive pronouns on their own cannot
distinguish inclusive versus exclusive first person.3-77. [ai/ si] afawulibuki-na-a-hwa.","[166, 167, 168]"

pronouns, e.g. comitative case is attached to object pronouns, ablative case is

The position of an interrogative word in a clause is the same as in thecorresponding non-interrogative counterpart (i.e. in situ), albeit intraclausal syntax is
rather free (§5.4). These interrogative words occur by themselves, not being part of
another phrase (‘interrogative pronouns’). Two of them, namely dahala ~ da=la
‘whose’ and naho ‘which’ can also act as modifiers of head nouns (‘interrogative
adjectives’). On par with personal pronouns (§3.2.2; §4.6), the interrogative word
for ‘who’ also has a citation form da ‘who’, an object form dafumbo ‘whom’ and a
genitive form dahala/ dala ‘whose’.da‘who’dafumbo‘whom’ (who:OBJ)dahala/ da=la‘whose’ (who:GEN/ who=GEN)ga‘where’guku‘how’naho‘what’/ ‘which’nahombo‘why’nuŋgni‘when’nuŋgwi‘how many’/ ‘how much’(but naho=mbo (what=OBJ) ‘what’)There are also special interrogative copulas: de ‘who be’ and ke ‘where be’

"One major difference between the Senagi languages and the surrounding
languages is that Senagi languages are heavily into clause-chaining whereas the
surrounding languages are not, except Karkar-Yuri. All surrounding languages have
simple verbal cross-reference systems, typically cross-referencing only with the
number of the subject; this contrasts with the Senagi languages which have multiple
sets of cross-reference suffixes for both subject and object, marking number, person
and sometimes gender features. Comparing with surrounding languages, the Senagi
languages have a richer inventory of case markers.",[62]
"2.2.4Vowel restrictions
There is no instance of a lexical morpheme containing more than one /e/, and/ʊ/ is not found at the beginning of native words (there is a Papuan Malay loanwordoto /ʊtʊ/ ‘car’).19,20There are few monomorphemic vowel sequences. Apart from /ei/, all vowel
sequences have an /a/ vowel: /ai/, /au/, /ia/, /ʊa/ and /ua/. These vowel sequences are
syllabified as two different syllables (the usual maximum shape of syllables is CCV;
§2.2.1). The stress-placements in the following words also indicates that the vowel
sequences are syllabified as two separate syllables (primary stress falls on the
penultimate syllable for nouns; §2.4.1), e.g. yaflei /ja.ɸ

"There are three open word classes in Menggwa Dla: nouns, adjectives and
verbs (§3.1). Verbs always carry affixes, whereas nouns and adjectives are mostly
morphologically simplex (§3.1.1). Words which denote properties are mostly5adjectives, but there are also property verbs and property nouns. Adjectives can
modify a head noun in its citation form, but nouns must be attached with a nominal
clitic to function as noun modifiers (§3.1.2). There are the following minor word
classes: nominal clitics (case clitics, topic clitics, focus clitics; §3.2.1), personal
pronouns (§3.2.2), interrogative words (§3.2.3), demonstratives (§3.2.4), quantifiers

"The use of the object case clitic =mbo is not obligatory; =mbo is seldom
used when the cross-reference suffixes are sufficient in determining the grammatical
relationships, or when the semantic roles of the arguments are unambiguous. In the
following example, real-world knowledge tells us that humans cook bandicoots and
bandicoots are incapable of cooking; hofowali ‘bandicoot’ is without doubt the
undergoer, and hence it is the object (there are no voice oppositions in Menggwa

inanimate force is the object (it can take the object case clitic =mbo; §4.5.1). The
subject of the first clause is coreferential with the subject of the second clause, and
hence the first clause is marked as coreferential (despite the fact that the semantic
role of the subject changed from undergoer to actor).","[476, 477]"
"There are two grammatical case clitics in Menggwa Dla: object case =mbo

inside’), adessive case =hi/ =sehi (‘on’), allative case =na(mbo) (‘to’) and ablative
case =hya (‘from’) (see §4.5.3). There is actually another local case: perlative case=roŋgo (‘through’). However, it is also often used to mean ‘together’, similar to
210the comitative case =lofo (see §4.5.4). There are also the proprietive case =mbi
and abessive case =mboka, meaning ‘have’/ ‘exist’ and ‘not have’/ ‘not exist’
respectively (see §4.5.5). There are three non-case nominal clitics: the topic clitic=na (§4.5.6) and the focus clitics =amba ‘also’ and =pa ‘only’ (§4.5.7). The
following is a table summarising the nominal clitics, and any corresponding verbal

particles or affixes. Firstly, the nominal clitics are attached to the last independent
word in a noun phrase (or other clitics if the noun phrase has more than one clitic);
the clitics are not attached to words of any particular word classes. (Unlike the
corresponding verbal suffix which is always attached to verbs.)4-59. wali imbu=na/

that the phoneme /b/ in these clitics is considered word-medial rather than wordinitial (§2.1.3.2). Thirdly, the case clitics (sometimes) form part of the stress and
pitch domain of their phonological host (see §2.4).","[224, 225, 226]"

"1.4.3Senagi language family: Dla versus Anggor
Dla has one sister language: Anggor. Together Dla and Anggor form theSenagi language family. The Senagi language family is named after the Anggorspeaking village of Senagi; Anggor was referred to as the ‘Senagi language’ in older
Australian government records (similarly, Dla was referred to as the ‘Kamberatoro
language’; Loving & Bass 1964). Würm (1975) and Voorhoeve (1975) consider the
Senagi language family as part of their Trans New Guinea phylum. Ross (2005)
tentatively considers Senagi and all surrounding families (except Pauwasi to the west)
as not part of the Trans New Guinea family. I currently see no strong evidence of
genealogical relationships linking the Senagi family with other language families
(see also §1.4.4).
35R. Litteral (1980) is an account of discourse features in Anggor; it also
includes a small chapter on the phonology and morphosyntax of the language. Other
published works on Anggor include R. Litteral (1972, 1981) and S. Litteral (1972,
1981). Anggor is analysed as having the following eighteen consonant phonemes: p,t, k, b, d, g, mb, nd, ngg /ŋɡ/, f /ɸ/, s, h /x/, m, n, ng /ŋ/, r, w, y /j/, and the following
seven vowel phonemes: i, e, a, o, u, ü /ɨ/, ɨ /ə/ (R. Litteral 1980: 41-42). More
investigation is needed to work out the sound correspondences between Anggor and
Dla comprehensively. Nevertheless, the following are some preliminary
observations of the phonological features in Anggor in relation to features which
differ between Menggwa Dla and Dla proper:
•/ɨ/ in Anggor usually corresponds with the epenthetic vowel in Dla proper
(e.g. Anggor: mbanɨ [mbanə] ‘sago’, Dla proper: ban [banə] ‘sago’,
Menggwa Dla bani [bani] ‘sago’). The /ɨ/ vowel in Anggor is probably an
epenthetic vowel; other than being very frequent, it is also deleted when
followed by a suffix which begins with a vowel. For instance, compare the
following two examples (R. Litteral 1980: 152):1-1.nggoafɨ-nɨpeodɨ kus-u
village-from1-2.come.down-3MSG‘he came down from the village’
•nggoaf-ambenɨmar-uvillage-insit-3MSG‘he sat down in the village’Anggor has one liquid phoneme like Dla proper, but unlike Menggwa Dla

The Dla tribe is known by the
governments of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea as ‘Dera’. The word ‘Dera’ is a
Malay rendition of the Dla Proper word dla [dəɺa] ‘name’; [ə] is an unstressed
epenthetic vowel, and the <e> in ‘Dera’ represents a schwa in Malay orthography
(<e> represents [ə] in unstressed syllables). In Malay, Dera is pronounced [dəˈla].
These days Dla people may also call themselves ‘Dera’ [ˈdɛɹa] with an anglicised
pronunciation following the practise of English-speaking Papua New Guinea
officials. Some Dla people call their language Awe after the word for ‘no’ in the
language (§3.2.9). It is a common in New Guinean (and also some Australian
Aboriginal) societies to name a language after the word for ‘no’ in that language.
Dla people call the language of the neighbouring Amanab people Awai based on the
same principle: awai is ‘no’ in Amanab language.","[48, 49]"

North-Central New Guinea is defined in Donohue & Crowther (2005) as thearea in New Guinea bounded by the Torricelli Mountains to the east, the Sepik area
and the Highlands to the south, and the Lakes Plain area (Taritatu River) and Tor
area to the west. The area shown in map 1.14 below corresponds roughly to the
North-Central New Guinea area described in Donohue & Crowther (2005). This is
the area where a lot of the small Papuan language families and isolates are spoken.
The language groups in this region are considered ‘small’ because the region is
surrounded by language families which have much larger geographical spread. The
45larger families are Tor-Kwerba family, Lakes-Plain family and Kaure branch of the
Trans New Guinea family to the west, the Ok branch and Mek branch of the Trans
New Guinea family in the highlands to the south, and languages of the Sepik and
Torricelli families to the east.","[57, 58, 59, 60]"
"The head of an externally-headed relative clause does not exist within the

the position relativised is the object, but the head noun phrase is not the object of the
matrix clause; in these cases, the head cannot take the object case clitic =mbo

"12‘Transitive’ here means ‘monotransitive’, i.e. having one subject and one object. It is potentially
confusing that the term ‘monovalent’ means having one semantic argument, while the term
‘transitive’ involves two core grammatical relations, and hence the term ‘monotransitive’ is avoided
here. There are indeed verbs like kefi ‘break’ (monovalent) (class IIB) which are monovalent(mono)transitive (§5.3.3); having the same prefix mono- used for both valency and transitivity can be
confusing.

‘He got it from me.’ (semi (s[a/e]mi-/ d[a/e]m(i)-) ‘get’ class II)Secondly, relativisation (§7.1.1) also makes indirect reference to grammatical
relations. Relative clauses can be externally-headed or internally-headed: relative
clauses are externally-headed when the position relativised is cross-referenced on the
relative clause verb, and internally-headed when the position relativised is not crossreferenced on the relative clause verb (§7.1.1).15 In relative clauses, of which the
verb is subordinate, subjects are always cross-referenced, objects are sometimes
cross-referenced, and second objects and obliques are never cross-referenced. This
means that relative clauses are externally-headed when the position relativised is the
subject or the object in some occasions, and internally-headed when the position
relativised is the second object, an oblique, or object in some occasions. See §7.1.1
for examples.",[312]
"6Personal pronouns are only used for human (or sometimes high animate)
referents, and there are different paradigms of personal pronouns (§4.6). There are
three ‘citation pronouns’: yo FIRST PERSON, si SECOND PERSON and ai THIRD PERSON.
These three citation pronouns do not mark number and gender features; for instance,ai can be translated as ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’ or ‘they’ in English. Citation pronouns are
used in isolation or when it is the subject of the clause. In contrast to the citation
pronouns, the object and genitive pronouns carry a cross-reference suffix which
marks person, number and sometimes gender features. While there are only three
citation pronouns, there are as many as fifteen object pronouns and fifteen genitive
pronouns. For instance, when referring to two male referents using a pronoun, a
citation pronoun ai ‘s/he/it/they’ is used when it is the subject, but a (much more
feature-specific) object pronoun aiahafanimbo ‘them two (masculine)’ is used when
it is the object.","[20, 21]"
"There are three types of pronouns: citation pronouns, case pronouns and
subject resumptive pronouns. Two factors distinguish the three sets of pronouns:
whether they carry cross-reference suffixes or not, and in what grammatical
relations/ pragmatic positions they are used. Case pronouns and subject resumptive
pronouns carry cross-reference suffixes; their cross-reference suffixes mark person,
number and sometimes gender categories. Citation pronouns, on the other hand, do
not carry cross-reference suffixes. In fact there are only three citation pronouns, one
for each person category. Case pronouns are used for grammatical positions which
require overt case marking in Menggwa Dla (§4.5), i.e. oblique positions and first
objects which are not topicalised. Citation pronouns and subject resumptive
pronouns are used in other positions, i.e. in isolation, topics, or subjects. Personal
pronouns are not used for second objects, i.e. the theme/ ‘gift’ in a ditransitive
clause. The following is a matrix of the three types of pronouns against the two
distinguishing factors.",[258]

Subjects can be expressed as (pro)nominals or cross-reference suffixes (§5.3.2). In
the first clause of the following example, the object noun phrase is topicalised in the
first clause, and the topicalised object of the first clause is coreferential with the
subject of the second clause. However, this coreference between the topic-object of
the first clause and the subject of the second clause is ignored by the SR morphemes
because SR morphemes only monitor the syntactic subjects, which are disjointreferential in this case. In the first clause, the subject noun phrase nyewi ‘person’ is
cross-referenced by -ya (N1FSG) on the verb (people of unknown gender are crossreferenced as feminine; §4.1.1), and the subject of the second clause is -Ø (3MSG),
which can be inferred as coreferential with the 3MSG reference of the previous clause,Pius.","[474, 475, 476]"

"The form of Malay language with which Dla people have the most contact
with is Melayu Papua Papuan Malay (PM) (e.g. Silzer, 1979; Roosman, 1982;
Burung 2005), the form of Papuan Malay spoken by New Guineans (around the
Jayapura area in particular). Papuan Malay loan words were borrowed into the Dla
language together with new things and ideas which were brought into Dla society by
the Dutch missionaries in 1950s. Most Malay loanwords in Menggwa Dla came
through Dla proper. One evidence is that Papuan Malay words with /s/ [s] and /r/ [r]
are rendered as /t/ [t] and /l/ [l] respectively in Menggwa Dla; this is the case
because Menggwa Dla borrowed these Papuan Malay words through Dla proper
which lacks /s/ [s] and /r/ [r] (§1.4.2), and /s/ [s] and /r/ [r] in Malay are rendered as
/t/ [t] and /l/ [ɺ] respectively in Dla proper. An example of this is bras ‘uncooked
rice’ in Papuan Malay versus blat ‘rice’ in Dla proper and blati ‘rice’ in Menggwa
Dla. The following is a list of some Malay loan words in Menggwa Dla. ‘Malay’
below refers to words which are common to PM, BM and BI; other varieties of
Malay have not been consulted. Some of these ‘Malay’ words exist in all varieties
of Malay but may be in common use only in certain varieties. In Malay orthography,e is [ə] or [e], ng is [ŋ] and ngg is [ŋɡ].20
