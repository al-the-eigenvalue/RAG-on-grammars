"2.5 How Siamou Fits into the Kru Language Family
Kru is a language family with 39 members, according to Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2013). In the
following sections, I describe some basic characteristics of Kru languages (2.5.1), and I show
how Siamou is an outlier both geographically (2.5.2) and linguistically (2.5.3). In 2.5.4 I provide
a list of all the Kru languages.
2.5.1. Characteristics of Kru Languages
Kru languages have an S Aux OV word order66, and sometimes an S (Part) VO word order
(2.5.1.1). They are also characterized by complex tone systems (2.5.1.2) and a basic aspectual
contrast of perfective and imperfective (2.5.1.3).
2.5.1.1 Kru Languages Are SVO and S Auxiliary OV
Kru languages have mixed word order properties. If there is no auxiliary, the word order is SVO
but in certain environments (such as negative clauses), the order may change to S Auxiliary OV.
The affirmative clause in (127a) has SVO order, but when the same clause is negated with an
auxiliary (127b), the order of the object and the verb is reversed, and the order is S Aux OV.

cooknegative (with AUX)Unlike auxiliaries, particles do not cause a change in word order. In (128), there is a
negative particle with a VO word order. This is the main way particles are distinguished from
auxiliaries in Kru languages: they do not cause a change in word order, while auxiliaries do
(Marchese 1986).",[111]
"A verb (V) and its object (O) are one kind of head-complement pair. In languages with
VO word order, such as English, the head (V) precedes its complement (O) in surface structure.
For example, in (19a), the verb eat precedes its object food. OV order is not possible (19b). The
verb-object pair in (19a) has the structure in (20). This conforms to the permitted structure from
(18a) because the head precedes the complement.

"VOOaffirmativenegative (with PART)na

drink tobaccoThe difference between auxiliaries and particles is that auxiliaries always occur in clauses
where the basic word order is S(Aux)OV whereas particles occur in clauses where the basic
word order is S(Part)VO. Thus, negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order from SVO in
the affirmative (35a) to S(Aux)OV in the negative (76b). Negative particles do not have such an
effect (77b).
Notice in (78) that the object kùà and the verb nu are reversed from one example to the
next: the negative perfective has OV word order while the negative imperfective has VO word
order. It also appears that the verbs are uninflected in this case, since the verb for the perfective
(78a) and imperfective utterances have the same form.",[178]
"Another SVO characteristic is that sentences with copulas have the order subject-NP Copula
predicate-NP, as in (43).

Marchese (1986) argues that even though SVO is the predominant word order in Kru, there are
more SOV characteristics than SVO characteristics. She argues that this is the result of a proto
SOV word order, which reflects the fact that Kru is part of the Niger-Congo language family
(Marchese 1986:23). This is supported by Koopman's (1984) analysis of verb-raising as
described above.
3.2.2.2 Siamou Only Has Surface OV
The crucial difference between Siamou and other Kru languages is that Siamou has exclusive
SOV word order (45). There is no alternation between SVO and SOV as there is in other Kru
languages.",[153]

Koopman (1984) analyzes the OV/VO alternation of the kind shown in (127) as a verb-second effect. The underlying position of the verb is in the VP following the object (OV). When
the higher INFL position is empty, the verb raises to fill it, resulting in an SVO order, as in
(127a). When there is an auxiliary, as in (127b), it fills INFL and the verb remains in situ,
resulting in an S Aux OV word order. Thus, S (Aux) OV would be the basic word order in Kru.
Marchese (1986) also argues that the surface SVO order has developed from a historic SOV
order (Marchese 1986:94). Kru has a number of OV properties that support this hypothesis. First
of all, Kru languages are predominantly suffixing. For example, in most Kru languages, the
plural is a suffix. The plural of pu ('gun') in Tepo is pui (129).

Imperfectives are negated by a particle. The particle does not cause a change in word order. In
the affirmative sentence in (77a), the verb (na) precedes the object (tawa), the same as (76a). In
the negative sentence (77b), the verb still precedes the object.

"127The correctness of Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry is not the main concern of
this dissertation. In the next section, I set aside anti-symmetry and look at head ordering and the
aspect phrase from the perspective of the Kru language family. From this perspective, the
structure in (33b) looks more tenable, and it is the one I adopt.
3.2.2 Siamou and Marchese's Generalization about Kru
The purpose of this section is to compare and contrast Marchese's (1986) generalizations about
Kru syntax (3.2.2.1) with what we find in Siamou (3.2.2.2), and to summarize what this says
about the structure of aspect in Siamou (3.2.2.3).
3.2.2.1 Kru Has Surface VO and OV Word Order
Kru languages are predominantly SVO (34a), except when there is an auxiliary, in which case
the order is S (Aux) OV (34b) (Marchese 1986:19–23).

Koopman (1984) argues that this alternation is a verb-second effect similar to what
occurs in many Germanic languages. In this analysis, the underlying word order in Kru is SOV.
If an auxiliary occurs in the inflectional phrase (INFL), that position is filled, and the word order
remains S (Aux) OV. If there is no auxiliary, the verb raises to INFL resulting in a derived SVO
word order.
In many Kru languages there is a contrast between auxiliaries and particles (Marchese
1986). (See 3.4.4.) Auxiliaries, as stated above, occur in clauses with an OV word order while
particles occur in clauses with a VO word order. For example, the auxiliary se (NEG.AUX) in (35)
changes the word order from SVO in (35a) to S (Aux) OV in (35b).","[149, 150]"
"Based on the data in (24-25), the head-final order seems to be the most prevalent surface order in
Siamou.
Cross-linguistically, there are certain properties that are more commonly associated with
SOV word order and other properties that are more commonly associated with SVO word order.
Siamou has mixed word order properties. For example, in Siamou enclitics and suffixes are
much more predominant than proclitics and prefixes. Enclitics are used to mark plurality (26a)
and definiteness (26b), and a suffix is used to mark aspect (26c). This is common for SOV
languages (Greenberg 1966, Marchese 1986, Comrie 1989, Croft 2003).

alwaysTo summarize, Siamou has some properties consistent with SOV languages, including
SOV word order, complement-head ordering of lexical heads and some functional heads, and a
preference for suffixes over prefixes. It also has a few properties consistent with SVO languages,
including head-complement ordering of some functional heads, and modifiers that follow their
heads. See 3.2.2.1 for more discussion of SOV and SVO properties.
Kayne (1994) would lead us to predict that all of the above structures that are head-initial
are un-derived, and all the ones that are head-final are derived by leftward movement. In the next
section, I look for independent evidence of leftward movement in Siamou.
3.2.1.3 Is There Evidence for Leftward Movement in Siamou?
This section explores three situations where movement commonly occurs cross-linguistically:
wh-questions, relative clauses and the formation of passives. (See Adger 2003.) Although this is
not the same type of movement as the verb-raising in anti-symmetry, we might expect that if a
language uses movement as a common strategy, it would be more likely to use movement to
derive its surface SOV word order. It turns out that Siamou does not use movement as a strategy
in wh-questions (3.2.1.3.1) or relative clauses (3.2.1.3.2), but it does in passives (3.2.1.3.3).
3.2.1.3.1 Wh-movement in Siamou? No
In many languages, wh-words raise to a higher position, leaving behind a trace (28a). Siamou,
however, has wh-words in situ (28b). Raising is ungrammatical (28c). Instead, an utterance like
(28c), without the trace, has a different interpretation, since the subject and object have inverted.

"Instead, Kayne (1994) argues that OV word order is derived from an underlying VO word order,
which means that (21a) has the structure shown in (23).94 The object (le) moves up from the VP
into a higher phrase (which I call XP for now). The original position of le is marked by a trace
(t). This is why Kayne's (1994) theory is called anti-symmetry: the OV structure in (23) is not
symmetrical with the VO structure in (20).

French: Il a mangé de la nourriture. (C)There are two main ways to derive this: for Kayne (1994), it must be the case that Siamou has an
underlying head-initial (VO) word order. In this case the aspect head precedes the verb phrase
(Asp VP) and the verb has to raise and adjoin to the aspect head in order to derive the surface
(VP Asp) order, as shown in (33a). The object must also raise to a higher position (called Spec
AgrOP) in order to derive the surface (OV Asp) ordering (see Pollock 1989 and Roberts 1997).
The second possibility, which Kayne (1994) would reject, is that Siamou has an
underlying head-final (OV) word order. In this case, the aspect head follows the verb and can
attach to it via right-alignment (V Asp). This is shown in (33b).

the word order is consistently SOV. However, most clauses have some kind of particle, often ri,
in second position. Perhaps further study will reveal that these particles are actually auxiliaries
similar to those in other Kru languages, and that they occur in all clauses, even though they may
not always be overt. This would mean that the INFL position is always filled and there is never
any cause for a change in word order because the verb never has to raise.
Section 3.2.1.2 discussed some SOV and SVO characteristics of Siamou as it related to
anti-symmetry. Here I look at some of these characteristics again, making a direct comparison
with the examples for Kru in 3.2.2.1.

subject suffix and a verbal suffix. She postulates the form S-a V-e (or possibly S-a V-le) for the
Proto-Kru imperfective. Nasal consonants are never mentioned in connection with Kru
imperfective aspect. This appears to be a Siamou innovation, or it may be the counterpart to the
/l/ found in other Kru langauges. Irregular Siamou verbs, however, have remnants of the original
Kru suffix. The regular form of the imperfective does not have /l/, but this is a common
characteristic of irregular imperfectives, and sometimes irregular perfectives as well.118 The
irregular verbs do more to connect the Siamou imperfective to the Kru imperfective than the
regular ones. In a more general way, Siamou regular imperfectives do pattern with other Kru
imperfectives in that they differ segmentally from the bare verb, whereas perfectives do not.
3.4.4 Aspectual Inflection and Negation: Siamou Diverges from Kru
There is a strategy for differentiating the perfective and imperfective in Kru which does not exist
in Siamou. All the Kru languages in Marchese's (1986) study for which she had the relevant data
had different negation strategies for the perfective and imperfective.
3.4.4.1 Perfective Uses Negative Auxiliary with OV Order
All perfectives in the Kru languages discussed by Marchese (1986) are negated by an auxiliary.
The auxiliary causes the word order to change from VO to OV. Example (76a) shows an
affirmative perfective. Notice that the verb (pi) precedes the object (sayɛ̀). Example (76b) is a
perfective negated by the auxiliary se. In this sentence, the object precedes the verb.
116The Vata examples in Table 3.28 are from Vogler (1974:395), discussed in Marchese (1986:51).
The Siamou examples in Table 3.28 are originally from Prost (1964), discussed in Marchese 1986:51). The
double vowels of the current forms are an orthographic convention. See 1.3.5.

3.2.2.3 The Structure of Aspect in Siamou Following Kru (Koopman 1984, Marchese 1986)
It appears that Siamou is even more strongly SOV than other Kru languages. Not only does it
have exclusive SOV word order, it also does not have some SVO characteristics that the other
Kru languages have. If Kru is underlyingly SOV, as argued by Koopman (1984) and Marchese
(1986), then Siamou would certainly be underlyingly SOV. According to this argumentation, the
best representation of aspect is not (54a), as Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry would
require, but (54b) in which the verb phrase is head final, and aspect adjoins to the right edge of
the verb phrase. In this case, no movement is required because this is exactly the surface order.
54.a.b.",[156]
"In Siamou, however, the passive is not morphologically marked in any way. Rather, if a
transitive verb has no object, it is interpreted as passive. An active Siamou sentence is given in
(31a) and its corresponding passive in (31b). The object le ('food') from (31a) is raised to subject
position in (31b).

"1193.2 The Headedness Debate: VO versus OV
This section focuses on Siamou syntax, and in particular on head-complement ordering. I
approach this topic from two angles. In 3.2.1, I look at Siamou through a particular theory of
syntax, called anti-symmetry, which proposes that all languages have the same underlying
structure in which heads always precede their complements (Kayne 1994). In 3.2.2 I look at
Siamou as a member of the Kru language family, which often has (surface) complement-head
ordering (Koopman 1984). In anti-symmetry theory, Siamou is assumed to be underlyingly headinitial, like all other languages. As a Kru language, however, and disregarding anti-symmetry,
Siamou is predominantly head-final, which is the structure I adopt.
3.2.1 Siamou and Kayne's Conjecture
This section has three subparts. Section 3.2.1.1 briefly explains the theory of anti-symmetry.
Section 3.2.1.2 shows that Siamou has consistent surface SOV (i.e. complement-head) word
order. In anti-symmetry theory, Siamou's SOV word order must be derived by raising. In this
case, we might expect to find other instances of raising in Siamou syntax. I look for evidence this
in 3.2.1.3, with mixed results. Finally, 3.2.1.4 presents two possible structures of the Siamou
aspect phrase, and shows which one Kayne's (1994) theory predicts to be correct.
3.2.1.1 Kayne (1994) Predicts Consistent VO
Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry predicts that phrases universally have the order headcomplement, as shown in (18a). A complement-head ordering that does not involve movement is
ungrammatical (18b). Instead, a structure in which a complement precedes its head must be
derived (18c).93

"He has been thinking.
* He is thinking-edIf we only looked at (64b), we might conclude that English does not allow aspect
stacking either, but that is clearly not true (see Cinque 1999). It just does not allow stacking on
the same verb. There is some evidence that this may be the case in Siamou as well. The utterance
in (65) expresses both prospective aspect and imperfective aspect. In order to accommodate both,
the utterance uses the verb tɛŋn ('be/become') with prospective aspect morphology. Imperfective
aspect is marked with an imperfective nominal táaŋn that is the subject of the verb.

"175Along with truth conditions, felicity conditions are an important component of the
meaning of an utterance. Felicity conditions are the facts about a situation that are required in
order for an utterance to be judged appropriate in that situation. Sometimes the structure of a
sentence affects its felicity conditions (Austin 1975, Matthewson 2004). For example, (8a) and
(8b) have different structures. The sentence in (8b) is a clefted version of (8a), where the subject
(your mom) is moved and put in focus.

This dissertation makes claims about the syntax of the Siamou aspect phrase. Siamou
aspect is right-headed and it is divided two levels: an upper aspect phrase containing completive,
stative, prospective 1 and prospective 2, and a lower aspect phrase containing perfective and
imperfective. These heads correspond to Liao's (2005) ""temporal aspect"" and ""viewpoint aspect.""
There are many unresolved issues regarding the syntax of the extended verbal projection
as presented in 2.3.4 and repeated in (40). In particular, the relative ordering of the pre-predicate
particles and the right-edge particles has not been clearly mapped out. Additionally, the location
of the subject in the Siamou phrase has not been determined.

For Kayne (1994), anything that looks like SOV is really just SVO in disguise. Since Siamou has
many properties of SOV languages, including, of course, SOV word order, Kayne (1994)
predicts that these structures must all be derived by leftward movement (even though leftward
movement in Siamou is not very pervasive). If we adopt Kayne's (1994) analysis, this has
implications for the structure of the Siamou aspect phrase, as I explain below.
In Siamou, aspect follows its VP complement as a verbal suffix (VP-Asp), as shown in
(32). The aspect head -ɲɛ̀n (STAT) is given in brackets, preceded by the verb phrase (le dì). The
rest of the clause that is not part of the aspect phrase is in parentheses.
32.","[148, 149]"
"She ate dinner at 2:00.
My goal in the next chapter is to establish the truth and felicity conditions for two Siamoumorphemes: the low tone suffix that I have been calling perfective aspect, and the -n suffix that I
hav been calling imperfective aspect, and to see how closely they match commonly accepted
truth and felicity conditions for perfectives and imperfectives. In a language, when a certain
phonological form regularly occurs in an utterance in conjunction with a consistent meaning or
set of meanings, we associate that form with the meaning(s) accompanying it. We like to give the
form some kind of name or label to identify it. Since similar sets of meanings occur in many
different languages, if the interpretation of a particular form in one language is similar to one that
occurs in one or more other languages, it is useful, for the sake of cross-linguistic comparison, to
give them the same name. Therefore, I will test whether or not the Siamou low tone suffix fits
the general definition for perfective aspect, and whether or not the Siamou -n suffix fits the
general definition for imperfective aspect. I will also determine how closely the meanings
associated with these forms match meanings associated with other forms with the same label in
other languages. If the Siamou forms have meanings similar to forms in other languages that are
called perfective or imperfective, it is sensible to give the Siamou forms the same name. This is
not to say they are equivalent, but they have some basic features in common.
In order to reach the goal of establishing truth and felicity conditions, we need a way of
formalizing concepts so that a language can be examined systematically. This is the purpose of a
theoretical framework. It provides a vocabulary and allows us to define the terms perfective and
imperfective. Using these definitions, we can make predictions about the behaviour of these
forms, and then test these predictions by eliciting utterances, along with truth and felicity
judgments, from native speakers of a language. These tests are called diagnostics. Over the next
few pages, I discuss the theoretical framework that I adopt for my analysis of the Siamou verb
forms that correspond to the perfective and imperfective.
Perfective and imperfective aspect both belong to the category of grammatical aspect.
However, their deployment is sensitive to the lexical properties of the verbs that they combine
177with. Therefore, in order to understand the perfective and imperfective, which are instances of
grammatical aspect, we need to consider how lexical aspect interacts with grammatical aspect. In
the following two subsections, I look first at two theories of grammatical aspect (4.2.1) and then
at lexical aspect (4.2.2).
4.2.1 Theory 1: Event Time Fully Contained in Reference Time (Kratzer 1998)
This section explores two theories of grammatical aspect—from now on simply aspect— that are
very closely related, but different. The first is from Kratzer (1998) (4.2.1.1) and the second from
Klein (1994) (4.2.1.2). I show that while Klein and Kratzer have the same definition for
imperfective aspect, Klein's definition of perfective aspect is slightly broader than Kratzer's
(4.2.1.3), and I discuss the implications of adopting the second type of perfective.
For Kratzer (1998), perfective aspect arises when the event time is contained within the
reference time (time(e) ⊆ time(r)). Imperfective aspect arises when the reference time is
contained within the event time (or, in other words, the event time extends past the boundaries of
the reference time) (time(r) ⊆ time(e)). These two definitions are formalized in (12) below, from
Kratzer (1998:17).

"952.5.3 Siamou Is an Outlier Relative to Other Kru Languages
Of the 39 Kru languages, most fit into two branches: a western branch (23 languages) and an
eastern branch (11 languages). Of the remaining five languages, three belong to the Aiza group,
spoken in Ivory Coast. Two languages, Kuwaa and Siamou, do not belong to any subgroup
(Marchese 1983, Lewis et al. 2013).
This means that we expect Siamou not to show stronger similarity to Western Kru
languages than to Eastern Kru languages, nor the other way around. It may have some properties
that resemble Western Kru languages, some that resemble Eastern Kru languages, and some
properties that are distinct from both. Chapter 3 looks at how Siamou perfective and imperfective
aspect compare with these aspects in Kru. I argue that the Siamou perfective is a L tone suffix.
However, in surface form, sometimes the L tone surfaces, and sometimes it does not. In Kru, the
general pattern is that the Western branch has an unmarked perfective and the Eastern branch has
a L tone perfective. Thus, the surface forms of Siamou perfectives sometimes resemble Western
Kru perfectives and sometimes resemble Eastern Kru perfectives. Siamou differs from both
Western and Eastern Kru languages, however, in the formation of negative perfectives. In the
other languages, negating a perfective structure with a negative auxiliary causes a change in
word order from VO to OV. In Siamou, the word order is always OV, and there is no change in
word order when perfectives are negated.
2.5.4 List of Kru Languages
Below is a list of all the Kru languages according to Ethnologue (Lewis et al. 2013). They are
sorted according to family groupings: first the western branch, then the eastern branch, the Aizi
grouping, and finally the two outliers: Kuwaa and Seme (Siamou). The country each language is

This chapter was an overview of the Siamou language. There are 32 phonemes and eight
tone melodies. Siamou has a S (Part) OV word order, and lexical heads follow their
complements. The extended nominal projection contains adnominals, NP suffixes that mark
plurality and definiteness, a left-edge definite particle and a possessive particle ǹ. In the extended
verbal projection there is a clause-initial quotative particle, a number of pre-predicate particles,
clause-final particles, and some unusual verb stems. Section 2.4 provided some background on
Siamou, including demographics (2.4.1), a review of the literature relating to Siamou (2.4.2) and
a brief description of Siamou culture (2.4.3). The last section (2.5) was a description of how
Siamou fits into the Kru language family. In short, it shares some properties with other Kru
languages, but it is a geographical and genetic outlier.","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
"In this case, the modal base contains propositions that have to do with real-world facts: for
example, I am a graduate student. Graduate students write dissertations in order to graduate.
Finishing a dissertation requires working on it. These facts are all consistent with each other. The
ordering source in this case consists of the set of propositions expressed by the phrase what I
want. I have two relevant desires: I want to finish my dissertation, but I also want to never work
on it. The propositions in the modal base (the facts about the world) are not inconsistent with
each other. Nor are my desires inconsistent with each other. It is only when we try to combine
the worlds picked out by the modal base (i.e. the factual worlds) with the worlds picked out by
the ordering source (i.e. the worlds in which I get what I want) that we encounter inconsistencies.
Unfortunately, there are no worlds in which I can have everything I want because the world is260If there is a non-empty modal base, the ordering source ranks a subset of the worlds picked out by the modal
base.

it doesn't restrict the set of worlds.",[358]
"Each level of this tree is discussed in the following subsections, along with a few other topics

2.3.3.1 Pronouns

other set regular pronouns (Table 2.22; following Thiessen (2005)), but I do not know the rules
that govern the choice of one type of pronoun over the other. The regular pronouns are usually a
shortened version of the emphatic pronouns.

7.2.4 Variation in the Specification of Modality
In languages, modals are often not completely specified for each modal component (the modal
base, ordering source, and modal force).
7.2.4.1 Underspecifiying the Modal Base and the Ordering Source: English
In English, for example, modals have a lexically determined modal force, but their modal base
and ordering source are partially based on context (Kratzer 1981, 1991). Thus can in (23) might
have deontic modality, as in (23a) (giving permission) or dynamic modality, as in (23b)

Of the eight tone melodies introduced in 2.2.1, only a subset are used in the aspectual
paradigm. Siamou has six aspectual suffixes: perfective, stative, completive, imperfective,
prospective aspect 1 and prospective aspect 2. These suffixes may bear one of three tone
melodies: L (perfective -L, completive -è and stative -ɲɛ̀n), M (imperfective -n and prospective
aspect 1 -a) and HL (prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂).20 These aspectual suffixes are the focus of
chapter 3.
The perfective is marked by a L tone suffix. The completive is marked by the suffix -è,
and the stative by the suffix -ɲɛ̀n. These three suffixes make up the L tone aspectual class.
The M tone class has two members: the imperfective, which is a M tone nasal consonant
suffix, -n, and the prospective aspect 1, which is the M tone suffix -a.
One aspectual suffix has a HL tone melody. This is the prospective aspect 2, -bɛ̂.
Table 2.20 lists Siamou's eight tone melodies, all of which occur on verbs, and shows
three tone melodies that are used in the aspectual paradigm.

reference for the topics discussed in later chapters. Section 2.3.1 is about Siamou word order,

and extended verbal projections, respectively.","[57, 58]"

melodies are contours. There are two falling contours (HL and H!H) and one convex (risingfalling) contour (M!HL). Interestingly, there are no surface rising tones in Siamou.
There is no full set of words contrasting all eight tone melodies. However, Table 2.7
shows a set of words that contrast the first seven tone melodies. If no word or morpheme is

All eight tone melodies are realized on nouns, verbs and adjectives. However, not all
melodies are equally robust in each category. In order to determine the frequency of each tone
melody, I looked at all the single syllable nouns and verbs in the Siamou dictionary (Thiessen et
al. n.d). This information is shown in Table 2.9. Data for adjectives and other grammatical
categories is not available at this time.

Other similarities between Siamou and other Kru languages include a number of grammatical
morphemes that appear to be cognates (such as the negative particle bo in Siamou and the
negative particle be in Grebo), and word order, both in the verbal and nominal domains. Person
(1966) also gives a historical explanation for the geographical distance between Siamou and the
other Kru languages, arguing that Kru languages were originally spoken further north than they
are now, in Ivory Coast and Liberia, until the Mandé and the Maninka pushed them out. Most of
them moved south, except for the Siamou, who fled north into Burkina Faso (Person 1966).
2.4.2.1.3 Traoré (1984, 1985) on Siamou
In his work on Siamou phonology, Traoré (1984) covers all the phonemes of Siamou, vowel
nasalization, and tone. His focus is the dialect of Siamou spoken in Bandougou, which differs
from the other dialects mainly in phonetics and phonology. He systematically works through the
possible sound combinations and syllable structures. He discusses how words borrowed from
Jula are changed to fit Siamou phonology (usually by changing three-syllable words into two60Plawi (or Plaoui) is spoken in Ivory Coast (Person 1966). Marchese (1983:115) lists it as a Grebo dialect.","[100, 101]"
"336such that in order to finish my dissertation, I have to work on it. The ordering source determines
which of the worlds in the modal base best match my desires. By combining the worlds
accessible from the modal base and the worlds accessible from the ordering source, we end up
with two types of worlds: worlds in which I never work on my dissertation and never finish it,
and worlds in which I work on my dissertation and finish it. My desire to finish my dissertation
outweighs my desire to never work on it. Therefore I can truthfully utter (19). The ordering
source discussed here (having to do with desires) is called a bouletic ordering source. See
Kratzer (1991) for more examples of ordering sources.
7.2.2.3 The Modal Force
The third dimension of a modal is the modal force which is the relative strength of a modal. It
has to do with whether a modal is a universal or existential quantifier over possible worlds.
Modal force ranges from strong necessity (something has to be the case) to weak possibility
(something might be the case). Strong necessity is a universal quantifier and weak possibility is
an existential quantifier. For example, compare the two utterances in (20).

the event time before the speech time, present tense would have the two overlap, and future tense
would order the event time after the speech time. These ordering relations are shown in Table

"1.3 Overview of the Thesis
The dissertation is structured as follows: Chapter 2 is a descriptive overview of Siamou
grammar. Chapter 3 focuses on the morpho-phonology and morpho-syntax of Siamou aspect.
Chapter 4 introduces the background on theories of perfective and imperfective aspect, including
a set of diagnostics for both. Chapter 5 uses these diagnostics to show that Siamou has a L tone
suffix that encodes perfective aspect and a M tone nasal suffix that encodes imperfective aspect.
Chapter 6 analyzes the sentence-final particle ín as a past tense, with a number of associated
implicatures. Chapter 7 is a description and preliminary analysis of Siamou future expressions.
Chapter 8 is the conclusion. Since these chapters cover a range of topics, it is possible to read
most of them independently, except for chapter 5 which relies heavily on concepts introduced in
chapter 4. In the following subsections, I give a preview of the major findings of each of these
chapters.
1.3.1 The Grammatical Sketch
Chapter 2 provides background information about Siamou grammar and a brief description of
Siamou's phonology, including the inventory of consonants and vowels, syllable structure, and
tone. This chapter also surveys Siamou syntax, with information about basic word order (SOV),
and some detail about the nominal projection and the verbal projection. The discussion of the
nominal projection covers pronouns, modifiers, plurality, definiteness, possession and
nominalized verbs. The discussion of the verbal projection focuses on functional particles,
11including a left-edge quotative particle, seven pre-predicate particles, and four right-edge
particles, concluding with a brief description of verb stems. The final portion of this chapter is a
short introduction to the Kru language family that shows how Siamou fits in. Siamou is an
outlier among the Kru languages both geographically and genetically. This chapter is important
because information about Siamou grammar is scarce and difficult to access. This is the first time
some of this information has been made available. It is also an important tool for understanding
this thesis. The remaining chapters focus on issues pertaining to tense and aspect. The
background provided in this chapter is intended to make the data in the following chapters more
comprehensible.
1.3.2 The Morpho-Phonology and Morpho-Syntax of Aspect in Siamou
Chapter 3 hones in on aspect. Siamou has a set of six aspectual morphemes that are all verbal
suffixes. These suffixes are partitioned into three inflectional tone classes: a low tone class,
which includes perfective (marked by a low tone suffix -L), completive -è, and stative -ɲɛ̀n; a
mid tone class, which includes imperfective -n and prospective aspect 1 -a; and a high-low tone
class, which includes prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂. There are two possible analyses for the morphosyntax of Siamou aspect. The first, following Kayne's (1994) anti-symmetry theory, is that
Siamou has an underlying VO word order and that the verb rises to a higher aspect position
while the object rises to an even higher position. The second possibility, which is supported by
data from the Kru language family, and which I adopt, is that the underlying word order is OV
and that the aspectual suffix attaches to the verb via right-alignment.
Regarding the internal structure of the aspect phrase, data from Siamou is consistent with
an independently motivated structure (Tenny 2000, Liao 2005) in which the aspect phrase is
divided into a lower aspect head and a higher aspect head. In Siamou, the lower head contains
perfective and imperfective aspect, and the higher head contains the remaining aspects:
completive -è, stative -ɲɛ̀n, prospective aspect 1 -a, and prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂. Although I
have not analyzed the completive and stative suffixes, preliminary results indicate that they both
resemble perfects in some ways, which means that they fit into the category of grammatical
aspect. The perfective -L and the imperfective -n differ from the other aspect suffixes in that they
have less phonological content, and in that they have morphological irregularities, which the
other suffixes do not. If there are two levels of aspect, stacking is predicted to occur. Siamou12does not allow stacking of aspectual suffixes on a single verb. However, it appears that stacking
may occur in complex structures that involve an auxiliary verb and a nominal form.
This chapter also contains a comparison of Siamou perfective and imperfective aspect
with perfective and imperfective aspect in Kru, the language family to which Siamou belongs.
Siamou perfectives and imperfectives are similar in many ways to Kru perfectives and
imperfectives, including elements such as tone and segmental form. However, while Kru negates
perfectives differently than imperfectives, Siamou negates all finite phrases the same way. The
final part of this chapter contains an appendix that gives a detailed description of irregular verb
forms. This chapter is important because it identifies many of the morphemes that are the focus
of the following chapters, in particular the perfective and imperfective. Since these aspectual
suffixes are marked mainly suprasegmentally by tone, they are not easy to pick out in a phrase.
This chapter is the net that catches the butterflies I wish to study.
1.3.3 The Semantics of the Perfective and the Imperfective
Chapter 4 is largely a review of the literature on topics relating to perfective and imperfective
aspect with formal definitions and descriptions of tense and aspect, as well as perfective and
imperfective aspect. Klein (1994) and Kratzer (1998) have different definitions of perfective
aspect that make different predictions, but they have the same definition for imperfective aspect.
This chapter provides an overview of lexical aspect, and discusses the interaction of lexical
aspect with grammatical aspect. The final section is devoted to collecting a set of diagnostics for
perfective and imperfective aspect. These diagnostics are tailored for a language in which the
perfective has a default past interpretation and the imperfective has a default present
interpretation. For the perfective, it is necessary to show that it is not past tense, and that the
default past interpretation is actually expected for perfectives. For the imperfective, it is
necessary to show that it is not present tense, and that the default present interpretation is
expected for imperfectives. Diagnostics for perfective and imperfective aspect also rely on
termination and culmination entailments, and the interpretation of inflected verbs with adverbial
modifiers.
1.3.4 The Semantics of the Perfective and the Imperfective in Siamou
Chapter 5 uses the diagnostics from chapter 4 to diagnose perfective and imperfective aspect in
Siamou, focusing on a subset of the aspectual morphemes from chapter 3: the low tone suffix -L,13and the mid tone nasal suffix -n. The diagnostics for perfective aspect show that the low tone
suffix -L meets the criteria for perfective aspect. These diagnostics also reveal that perfective
aspect in Siamou has a strong default past interpretation, but is not past tense. The diagnostics for
imperfective aspect show that the mid tone nasal suffix -n meets the criteria for imperfective
aspect. Once these morphemes have been identified, they are compared and contrasted with
perfective and imperfective aspect in other Kru languages. The final part of this chapter explores
an intriguing discovery about the Siamou language that is revealed by these diagnostics: Siamou
has no stative main verbs.
1.3.5 The Semantics of Past Tense ín and its Implicatures
Chapter 6 focuses on the sentence final particle ín. This particle marks past tense, which
indicates that the reference time of an utterance precedes its speech time no matter which
aspectual suffix it occurs with. Siamou aspect suffixes can be categorized according to whether
they have a default past interpretation, a default present interpretation, or a future interpretation.
The particle ín always causes these types of utterances to shift their interpretation to the past. The
second part of this chapter looks at a number of implicatures of the particle ín. An implicature is
a meaning that an utterance has beyond what is actually stated. The implicatures of ín include the
following readings: remote past, counterfactual, and cessation, and also possibly politeness and
doubt. These readings are mostly predicted from the basic past tense meaning of ín. However,
the way in which the politeness and doubt readings arise is not clear.
1.3.6 The Semantics of Futurity in Siamou
The displacement property of language allows us to speak not only of what has already happened
in the past, but about what will happen in the future. Chapter 7 looks at Siamou's three future
expressions. These three expressions involve a total of three syntactic positions: an aspectual
position (which contains one of two prospective aspect suffixes, -a or -bɛ̂), a modal position
(containing the pre-predicate particle bè) and a finiteness position (containing the pre-predicate
particle ri). These positions are shown in the tree in (15).","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"364If someone ""manages"" to do something, this presupposes that what they did was difficult, or that
they met with some kind of obstacles that they overcame (see Portner (2009)).279 In order to do
something difficult, someone has to have the intention of doing it. It is not an accident, or
something that just happened. Therefore, one way of analyzing the particle bè in these types of
clauses is as a particle that encodes intention (usually on the part of the subject). Modal future
expressions may also be about intention. For example, Tonhauser (2011) argues that in
Paraguayan Guaraní, the suffix -ta is a modal future that encodes intention and prediction. She
describes intention as ""an agent's mental state of intending to make a proposition be true at a time
in the future"" (Tonhauser 2011:213).
The Siamou simple future bè. . .-a and the certain future bè. . .-bɛ̂, which both contain bè,
are compatible with an intention reading. For example, in (62), the first clause, which contains
the certain future bè. . .-bɛ̂, is about the subject's intentions, and the second clause, which
contains the simple future bè. . .-a, is about the speaker's intentions.

3.2.1.3.3 Movement in Siamou Passives? Yes
A final process that usually involves raising is passivation. The object of the verb raises to
subject position, along with other morphological changes (Tallerman 1998). For example, in
English, the passive is signaled by the verb be and the past participle of the verb (30).

"I can truthfully utter (21a) even if there are in fact no blueberries growing here. That is
because the relevant facts are whether the climate, soil and other conditions are such that they
would allow blueberries to grow here. In the modal base, i.e. the set of possible worlds that
include all the worlds where these conditions match the actual ones, there are some worlds in
which blueberries are growing here. Therefore it is possible for blueberries to grow here.
Someone else could disagree with me and say, ""That's not true—the soil is too alkaline.
Blueberries can't grow here."" What he is saying is that the worlds in the modal base are more
restricted than I first realized. All the worlds in which the alkalinity of the soil does not match
the actual soil alkalinity have to be excluded, although I had not originally taken that into
consideration. In this more restricted set of worlds, unfortunately, there are no worlds in which
blueberries are growing here.
The utterance in (21b) takes into account not just the known facts about the climate and
soil, but also the actual existence of blueberries here. If I know there are no blueberries, I cannot
utter (21b), even if I know that it is possible for them to grow here. In this case the set of worlds
in the modal base (according to what I know at the time) includes only worlds that match the
actual climate and soil conditions and also the facts about the existence of blueberries. I
obviously do not know all the facts when I utter (21b). If I did, I would simply say ""There are
blueberries growing here"" or ""There aren't blueberries growing here"". According to what I know,
the modal base includes some worlds in which blueberries are growing and some in which they
are not. In order for someone to prove me wrong in this case, he has to show that none of the
worlds in the modal base is a world in which blueberries are growing here. He would do this by
adding to the list of facts about the world, determining, for example, that there are no blueberries
along that edge of the trees, or in that open sunny area, or in the tall grass. In fact, there are no338worlds that are compatible with our knowledge in which blueberries are growing here.
Depending on the size of the plot of land we are referring to, this could be an arduous task.
Epistemic modals in Kratzer’s model may have an empty ordering source (no ordering at
all), a doxastic ordering source (having to do with what the speaker or someone else believes), or
a stereotypical ordering source (having to do with what is considered normal or natural in the
world). The ordering source for root (or circumstantial) modals can be bouletic (ordered
according to what I want), deontic (ordered according to what a certain set of rules prescribes),
teleological (ordered according to what someone’s goals are), dynamic (ordered according to
what someone is able to do), stereotypical or empty (no ordering at all).263
7.2.3.2 Portner's (2009) Classification of Modality
Portner, on the other hand, groups modals into three categories: epistemic, priority, and
dynamic. Epistemic modals in Portner’s classification are similar to those in Kratzer (1991), and
priority and dynamic modals together make up Kratzer's (1991) circumstantial modals. Priority
modals include deontic, bouletic, and teleological modals. Dynamic modals include volitional
and quantificational modals (of which I only look at volitional). Volitional modals include
ability, opportunity, and dispositional modals.
Of special interest in this chapter is the category of priority modals. The three kinds of
priority modals (deontic, bouletic, and teleological)264 are unified by the idea that ""such things as
rules, desires and goals all serve to identify some possibility as better than or as having higher
priority than others"" (Portner 2009:135). Deontic modality concerns things like morality, ethics
and laws (22a). Bouletic modality is about desires (22b), and teleological modality has to do with
goals (22c).

Following this, section 5.5.2 focuses on how the lack of stative verbs affects the emergence of a
factative in Siamou.
5.5.1 Diagnosing the Factative
The key property of the factative is that it makes a distinction between eventives and statives that
affects temporal interpretation (5.5.1.1). However, the factative is realized in a number of
different ways in different languages. In Igbo, the factative effect occurs with predicates that
have default aspect morphology (5.5.1.2), in Yorùbá on bare predicates (5.5.1.3), and in Kru
languages with perfective-marked predicates (5.5.1.4).
5.5.1.1 The Factative Imposes a State/Event Partition
Déchaine (1993) shows that the factative can be analyzed as a default tense effect. Usually the
tense of an utterance is specified by the tense marker of that utterance, if there is one. However,
if there is no tense marker, the tense of the utterance is interpreted as present. (It could also be
interpreted as overlapping the situation given by the previous sentence in a narrative or discourse
context, but I do not consider this part further.) This is stated formally in (62).
62.208 Given a sentence Sj, the temporal reference of Sj is interpreted to be
a.
a time consistent with the overt tense operator of Sj if there is one
b.
otherwise, T⦰ is interpreted to overlap with the utterance situation
c.
or T⦰ is interpreted to overlap with the situation denoted by Si, Si a sentence
which precedes Sj in the narrative.
This explains why statives have a present interpretation, but it does not explain why eventives
have a past interpretation. In order to derive the past interpretation of eventives, Déchaine argues
that only stative predicates are allowed to have their T⦰ linked to the utterance time. In order for
eventives to have a temporal reference, then, they need to be reinterpreted as states. One way to
do this is with a result state: if the eventive happened in the past, then the current state of things
is a result of that event. Therefore, if the result state of that eventive is interpreted as present
(according to 61b), then the event itself must have happened in the past.
This kind of effect (i.e. the factative) is extremely pervasive in Niger-Congo, and
especially in Kru. Marchese (1986) states that every Kru language she studied had a factative.
208Example (62) is from Déchaine (1993: 577).","[283, 284]"
