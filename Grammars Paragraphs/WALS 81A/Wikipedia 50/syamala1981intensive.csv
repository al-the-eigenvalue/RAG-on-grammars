":'"".'•' ,,•Each drill has a specific objective of achieving a particular linguistic
activity. Repetition drill enables the learners to listen to model utterances
of the teacher/native speaker and then repeat the same so that proper practice
of correct pronunciation, Sandhi and intonation are taken care of. The
repetition drill also gives the learner a clear picture, at a glance, of the structural
bits introduced in that lesson. Build up drill provides the learners with
ample opportunities to practise the normal word order of the sentence and
helps them memorise the sentence through a' systematic building up of the
same by a progressive addition of words in the given order.
Expansion
drill enables the learners to be familiar with the placement of additional words
in a given sentence frame and thus form a bigger sentence. Substitution drill
deals with the selectional restriction among different categories of words in a
sentence and among different manifestations of a single word and also gives
practice of vocabulary items. Restatement drill is meant to enable the learners
. to practise the formation and use of different varieties of sentence patterns
while transformation drill, in addition to the above purpose, also takes care
of the inter-relationship between sentences. Response drill gives practice to
put questions and give answers and for making relevant statements in appropriate contexts. While Reinterpretation drill gives practice for the expression
of the meaning of a given sentence pattern in more than one way, Completion
drill prepares the learners for the ready mastery of structural elements that
form meaningful sentences. If a teacher administers the above drills in a
class room, he can decide on the basis of the situation whether it should be
chorus, chain or individual. In short, drills enable the learners to train themselves in the use of different types of meaningful utterances that make up the
language.
While drills give practice to the learners for mastering the linguistic rules
by automation, exercises are meant to find out whether the learners have
imbibed the rules which they practised inductively. So, it is necessary that
exercises are attempted only after administering drills. Exercises can be worked out by the learners both orally and in writing. The exercises are of different
types, testing the learning of various elements of grammatical features from
sandhi to formation of sentences that make up a conversation. Types of exercises included in this book can be summarised as below:XVI..","[15, 16]"

"The Central Institute of Indian Languages was set up on the 17th July,
1969 with a view to assisting and co-ordinating the development of Indian
languages. The Institute was charged with the responsibility of serving as
• a nucleus to bring together all the research and literary out-put from the various
linguistic streams to a common head and narrowing the gap between basic
research and developmental research in the fields of languages and linguistics
inlndia.
The Institute and its five Regional Language Centres are thus engaged
in research and teaching, which lsad to the publication of a wide-ranging
variety of materials. Preparation of materials designed for teaching/learning at
different levels and suited to specific needs is one of the major areas of interest
of the Institute. Basic research relating to the acquisition of language and
study of language in its manifold psycho-social relations constitute another
broad range of its interest. The publications will include materials produced
by the members of the staff of the Central Institute of Indian Languages and
its Regional Language Centres and associated scholars from Universities and
Institutions, both Indian and foreign.
The Central Institute of Indian languages has initiated a Basic Course
Series in major Indian languages to provide suitable and comprehensive material
for learning and teaching the language concerned for Indians. In a language
teaching situation, the teacher is expected to combine the roles of a psycholinguist, socio-linguist, linguist, language pedagogue, a creator of materials,
a literary critic and a testing and evaluation expert. Most of his competences
are naturally reflected in the materials, which simultaneously are graded from
simple to complex, known to the unknown and contrived to the natural. This
is a very difficult task. After research and experimentation we have come
out with more questions than answers at each stage of the material. For
example, how basic is basic ? What is grading ? In what way can linguistic
and cultural matter be graded ? Is question, with which most learning
begins, simpler than statement ? How does one move from a purely language
based competence to creating litrerary sensibilities ? How does one build
into the material conceptual prose ? How are lessons to be presented ?",[5]

"XV11As in the case of drills, exercises also have specific objectives
For example, exercises 1 to 4 test the operation of internal and external sandhi
and formation of compounds and sentence segments. Exercises 5 to 7 relate
to the mastery of selectional restrictions among the parts of a sentence and
different types of derivation and inflection in addition to testing the use of
vocabulary items. -From exercises 8 to 18, the emphasis is on the testing of
the ability to form various sentence patterns, their manipulations, inter-relationships and interpretations. Exercises 19 to 22 test the mastery of putting
questions and giving answers and providing appropriate responses to given
stimuli. Exercises 23, 24 and 25, test the comprehension and use of vocabulary
items learned. The rest of the exercise types test comprehension in general
and use of linguistic patterns in appropriate situations in particular.
The vocabulary section includes the words that occur in the conversation
for the first time. They are entered in the order of their occurrence in the
conversation. The meaning of the vocabulary item is given in English and is
most often restricted to the context in which it occurs in the lesson. In the
case of certain verbs that occur in their past tense forms, the verb stems are
also given in brackets while listing the vocaulary items. The index provided
at the end of this book lists, in the alphabetical order, all the words, which
appear in the lessons. There are a total of 1,869 words in this index. They
are also identified for their first occurrence in a unit and a lesson. Tn most
of the cases the majority of the words in a lesson, more or less, belongs to the
same semantic field, thus facilitating ready recall by the learners. The users
of this book may also refer to Recall Vocabulary in Malaya/am—Semantically
Classified (Central Institute of Indian Languages, mimeographed) and HindiMalayalam Common Vocabulary (197'3, Central Institute of Indian Languages),
as additional sources for learning Malayalam vocabulary.
The Notes give information pertaining to grammatical as well as cultural
features. Grammatical notes are given as explanations from the point of
view- of function. Each of the structural bits newly introduced in the lesson
finds a note on it with illustrative examples. When felt necessary, cross
references are made with respect to the preceding notes in the same lesson
or in the previous lessons. While explaining a grammatical point, use of
technical terms is kept to the minimum.
This Book as a Generalised CourseThough this book is the prescribed text for the Basic Course phase of
learning Malayalam in the Southern Regional Language Centre, it could beXV111easily used for any generalised second language programme in Malayalam
both by adult learners and their teachers. The teachers would do well to
expose their students to additional materials, prepared closely in conjunction
with the structures employed in a particular lesson. These materials may
be used for the development of all the four language skills: listening, speaking,
reading and writing.
Method Suggested
While pattern practice through different types of drills goes well in a
structural method, to get best results, the teachers should, depending upon the
background and capacity of the learners, adopt an eclectic approach that
integrates the various techniques found in different methods.
Development of reading skill includes both loud reading and reading for
comprehension. In a second language programme loud reading helps acquiring
correct reading pronunciation which in turn helps the mastery of morphophonemic complexities generally reflected through changes in letters. Good
reading pronunciation will also lead to development of speaking skill as far
as the above aspect is concerned. Recitation of poems is another relevant
activity in this regard.
For the development of reading comprehension the passages should be
prepared/selected and edited in such a way that they are both interesting and
informative. Such passages should not contain, or should contain only partly,
the contents which are already known to learners. The exercises that follow
the passages may consist of both objective and open ended types of questions.
Regular and balanced testing of all the elements with respect to the four
language skills is a must in any language programme. For that the teacher
should be well acquainted with various types of tests. This book also contains, as an appendix, a model objective test paper on Malayalam structure.
The test paper consists of 100 bits and should be completed in one hour.
As for developing the writing skill, the teacher may consider preparing
various types of materials such as those for script teaching and composition
writing. It is advisable for the teacher to practise giving dictation from the
very beginning, starting with words, phrases, sentences and, finally, passages.
While giving dictation, various sounds attached to each letter (different
sound values according to the initial, medial, final, etc., positions in which a
letter occurs) may be kept in mind and the teacher may choose such words and
sentences which are likely to be more diificult, hence requiring more practice.","[16, 17, 18]"
