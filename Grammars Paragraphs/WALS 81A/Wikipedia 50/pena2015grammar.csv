"[(Adv)(Subj)(Obj)(Obl)(Adv)V(Obl) ]Figure 16.1. Wampis simple lexical verb word orderThe basic constituent order in Wampis is predicate ""nal. In basic, pragmatically
unmarked declarative clauses, the word order is A P V, where A= most Agent-like
participant, P= most Patient-like participant, and V= Verb . However, the Wampis
language allows for other order of subjects and objects. Adverbs and Oblique arguments
are relatively free to occur before or after the predicate, but their preferred position in
terms of frequency is pre-verbal.
16.3. Alignment and grammatical relations
Grammatical relations concern the nature of the relationship between a
711predicate or a construction and its core arguments: the single argument of intransitive
constructions (S), the most agent-like argument (A) and the most patient-like arguments
of transitive constructions (Comrie 1978). Alignment has to do with the patterns by
which a language establishes the grammatical relations of those core arguments.
Alignment may be manifested in a variety of coding structures including contituent
order, participant-reference marking on verbs, case marking and various
morphosyntactic combinations thereof. The following discussion concerns the marking
of argument NPs in Wampis. The language exhibits also an uncommon pattern of
argument indexation on the verb, which was described in Chapter XIV.
Wampis exhibits a nominative-accusative alignment. S/A arguments are treated
di$erently from P. Importantly, Wampis distinguishes between subjects and nonsubjects, i.e. Wampis exhibits a symmetrical objects system (Bresnan & Moshi 1990).
The coding properties and syntactic behavior of objects in Wampis (notional direct and
indirect objects, objects of applicative) are identical.
In Wampis S/A as a category is relatively straightforward. S/A Noun Phrases are
treated in the same way at the syntax level. The marking of the subject (“Nominative”
case) is zero. Aspect, de""niteness, deixis or other category do not play any relevant role712in the marking of A/S NPs. The following examples illustrate the marking of the single
argument of an intransitive verb (S) for di$erent grammatical persons in (2)–(5), and
the marking of the Agent-like argument of a transitive verb (A) for di$erent
grammatical persons in (6)–(9).

Copular constructions are fairly used in the language. Copular constructions
analyzed in great detail in Chapter XVII.
16.6. The transitive construction
The Wampis transitive construction has a valence of two; that is, two arguments
that are grammatically manifested as subject and object. The most frequent word order
is Subject-Object-Verb (APV), although other orders are permitted in certain pragmatic
environments. Objects marked for focus normally occur in initial position and the
Subject occurs in post-verbal position (see (27) for an illustration of this pattern).
The marking of overt noun phrases depends on the grammatical relation
provided by the construction. Subject NPs are zero-marked, and all Speech Act
Participant Object NPs are marked with the accusative =na. Third person Object NPs
are not marked if the subject is a Plural Speech Act participant, according to the
hierarchy observed in §16.3.

arguments. When there are two overt arguments in a quotative construction, the prefer
order of the subject is post-verbal, and objects may occur at the end; i.e. they follow the
order [Quotation V A P]. Quotations themselves are always direct quotations, they are
never marked as arguments. See also §16.8.

Semantic goals with predications of movement (‘go’, ‘come’, etc.) do not require
an oblique argument. Constructions with emotion verbs do not “re-arrange” the
mapping of semantic roles onto di$erent syntactic categories; that is, the location,
experiencer or undergoer of an emotion predicate is instantiated as the grammatical
724subject, and the theme or stimulus is instantiated as the grammatical object.","[762, 763, 764, 765]"
"• Interrogative words remain “in situ” and are rarely moved to the front
In Wampis, an interrogative word is rarely moved to the front of the clause;
rather, interrogative words usually remain in their “normal” order where the
constituent replaced by the interrogative would be expected to occur. The canonical
order of major clauses elements in Wampis is Subject Object Verb (or APV/SV).",[400]
"16.7. The ditransitive construction
The ditransitive construction in Wampis can be de""ned as a transitive
construction with a valence of three arguments. The three arguments are an Agent (A)
codi""ed as the subject, a Theme (T) codi""ed as an object, and a Recipient (R) codi""ed
as another object. There is no especial marking distinguishing T and R: both Theme and
Recipient are treated identically: all objects in Wampis receive the accusative =na.
Third person objects are zero marked on the verb. When there is a second person or ""rst
person object, it is marked on the verb, that includes second or ""rst R arguments. The
order of constituents in a ditransitive construction is A T V R. Other frequent order is A
T R V, and A V T R is possible. On the other hand, the order R T V appears to be very
disfavored.

16.8. Quotative construction
The quotative construction requires a speech verb and codi""es two core
arguments, A and P, instantiated as the grammatical subject and object. The quotation
itself is not mark as an argument grammatically and it is always a direct speech report.
Quotative constructions are used in semantically equivalents of some complement
constructions (see §20.3.3 for more details).

"855(‘Arutama’) of the relativized verb (‘see’) does not take accusative marker, neither it
takes the focus =ka. This is an indication that, ""rst, Arutama is internal to the relative
clause (as it does not take =ka), and second, internally, the marked verb of the relative
is treated as a nominal and not as a predicate (as it does not mark its object, Arutama,
with the accusative).

I turn now to non-subject participants of the relativized verb. Such participants
are relativized with the Set II nominalizer -mau ‘non-subject nominalizer’. The head
noun is the object of the relativized verb. The example in (9) shows an object
relativization, with a gap strategy.

856VWhen the subject of an object relative clause is an overt nominal, the overt
subject precedes both the object (which is the head of the relative clause) and the
nominalized verb. That is, the structure as a whole is internally headed. This order
shows a good degree of isomorphism between relative clause and main clause word
orders, which are SOV. Notice that in internally headed relative clause structures, the
head of the relativized verb does not carry the accusative marker, just as in example (9)
above. The structural properties of this type of relative clause in Wampis is illustrated in
(10).

As we can see, in (10) the head of the relative clause, Arutam, is embedded as
part of the relativized clause. Again, notice that the head is not marked with an
accusative marker, unlike the object of the fully in/ected verb in (11).

arutama ‘head-Arutam’.","[895, 896, 897]"
"798Morphologically, the subordinate verb di$ers from the main verb in the marking
of certain categories. With regards to mood, only =ka ‘Interrogative’, =t͡su ‘Inferential’
and =ʃa ‘Speculative’ (these morphemes are described in Chapter XVIII) can be marked
on the subordinate verb, but these are clause-level clitics that can be received by other
constituents. Verb-only mood markers (i.e. all other mood su""xes in Wampis, cf. §14.4)
do not occur with subordinated verbs.
Subordinate verbs always have a morphological marking that indicates that the
verb does not belong to the main clause. Subordinate verbs can receive some in/ection
or not, depending on the type of switch-reference the subordinate verb co-occur with.
Non-canonical switch-reference su#xes -tatamana ‘Subject to object’ and -ma ‘Nonsubject to subject’ do not receive person marking, although they can occur with
conditional and concessive clauses. When the subordinate verb co-occurs with a
canonical switch-reference marker, it receives person marking.
Aside from their verb forms, subordinate clauses essentially retain the same
syntax as main independent clauses: case marking is the same; in general, relative order
of noun phrases, obliques and adverbs is relatively free; dropping of pronouns and
subject noun phrases is completely possible (actually, it is the most frequent pattern).","[838, 839]"
"703in the grammar of Wampis where one can see an old Jivaroan instrumental, probably
historically con/ated with the locative, in the nominalizer -tai ̃. This is an speculative
suggestion that remains to be more thoroughly analyzed.
15.4.5. Set II nominalizer -u, ‘subject nominalizer’
The subject nominalizer -u encodes di$erent semantic roles—agent, experiencer/
undergoer, force—all of which map onto the A/S participant of the verb. Unlike -inu,
which encodes prototypically animate agentive participants, -u can denote an animate
or inanimate participant. For descriptive convenience, I use the term “subject
nominalizer” to refer to the nominalizer -u. As mentioned in §15.3, an important feature
of Set II nominalizers is that, unlike Set I nominalizers, they can nominalize verb stems
which have aspectual information.

between Set II -u and Set I -inu (§15.4.1) (for instance, the grammatical realization of
the semantic role of the participants they denote is the subject of the nominalized verb),
there are also some di$erences. The most notable di$erence is the ability of Set II -u to
attach to aspectual stems, either imperfective or perfective. This allows Set II -u
nominalizations to be able to actualize interpretations of the action of the nominalized
verb in a scale of time (via the aspectual construal). Compare:
(22)

sleep+IPFV-NMLZ
‘one who sleeps’ or ‘one who is sleeping’b. kana-ka-u
sleep.PFV-INTENS-NMLZ
‘one who slept’c. kanu-inu
sleep-NMLZ
‘sleeper’705In (a) and (b), we can obtain interpretations of the nominalized verb as being
currently occurring or already occurred, respectively. By contrast, in (c) no such
interpretation(s) is/are possible, because the action of the nominalized verb is now a
property of the referent of the derived noun. This di$erence has important
consequences in the grammar: in Chapter XX, we will see that Set II nominalizers are
used primarily in modifying function (i.e. relative clauses), whereas Set I nominalizers
are used primarily in predicative functions.
15.4.6. Set II nominalizer -mau, ‘non-subject nominalizer’
Three main derivational properties are related to the su#x -mau: a) it creates a
noun that is understood as the patient or location of a verb; b) it creates a noun that is
understood as an action nominalizer; c) -mau also creates a stem to create locative
nominalizations, most frequently with the locative =nVma. To contrast -mau with the
other member of Set II, -u ‘subject nominalizer’, I use the term ‘non-subject nominalizer’
to refer to -mau. Historically, -mau likely developed from an old su#x *-ma plus the
nominalizer -u described in the preceding section. A likely source is the same morpheme
that is the modern the non-canonical switch-reference marker -ma ‘subject to object’
(see §19.10.1). Similarly to -u, -mau can attach to an aspectualized stem. Examples of706derivation with -mau are presented in (23).
(23)
nakuma ‘draw’→nakumɨ-a-mau ‘drawing (‘something that is being drawn’)(draw.IPFV-IPFV-NMLZ)

NMLZ)nakuma ‘draw’is already drawn’ (draw-INTENS-IPFV-NMLZ)
The nominalizer -mau also appears to derive nouns whose interpretation seems
to be that of an action nominalizer.
(24)
ha‘be sick’→ha-á-mau [haámu]‘death’ (be.sick-HIAF-NMZL)uutu ‘cry’→uutu-mau [uútmoo] ‘cry (N)’ɨmɨma ‘be proud’→ɨmɨma-mau [ɨmɨmamu] ‘pride’In relation to its ability to create action nominalizations, -mau is sometimes also
used to give a citation form of verbs.
The nominalizer -mau is also used to derived nouns that denote a location of the
action of the verb, cf. akiina ‘be born’ → akiina-mau [aki ́iɲamu] ‘birth’ or ‘place where
one is born’; arakama ‘plant (V)’ → arakama-a-mau [arákmamu] (plant-IPFV-IPFV-NMLZ)
‘what is planted (i.e. seeds, etc.)’ or ‘farm (sown ""eld)’. In most cases, however, -mau
needs to carry a locative marker to derive location nominalizations, most frequently -707mau occurs with the locative =nVma, as in shown (25).
(25)
puha ‘live+IPFV’ → puha-mau=nama [puhámunam] ‘where we live’
amu ‘""nish’ → amu-a-mau=nama [amúamunam] ‘where something the ends’, ‘end’
(""nish-IPFV-NMLZ=LOC)
The use of -mau in locative relativizations is described more in detail in §20.2.2
and §20.4
15.4.7. Negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau
The nominalizer -t͡ʃau can occurred attached to a root or aspectual stem. It
negates the element to which it attaches.
(26)
t͡ʃit͡ʃa‘speak’→t͡ʃit͡ʃa-t͡ʃau [t͡ʃi ́t͡ʃat͡ʃu] ‘quiet person’, ‘mute’kaka‘be strong’→kakait͡ʃau [kakɛ́it͡ʃu] ‘weak one’, ‘lazy one’nɨka‘know’→nɨkat͡ʃau [nɨkat͡ʃau]→surima-t͡ʃau [suri ́mt͡ʃoo]surima ‘be stingy’‘ignorant’ (‘one who does not know’)
‘generous person’The nominalizaer -t͡ʃau have developed from the negative verbal su#x -t͡ʃa and
Set II -u ‘agent nominalizer’. The nominalizer -t͡ʃau can also combine with adjectives,
other nouns and some adverbs, which indicates that formative -t͡ʃa in the nominalizer t͡ʃau is no longer analyzed by speakers as a verbal-only morpheme, hence -t͡ʃau is
analyzed as a synchronically unanalyzable morpheme.
15.4.8. Nominalizer -na
The nominalizer -na does not have a productive derivational function, but for
708sake of completeness it is described here. The nominalizer -na occurs with the potential
stem (formed with -mai), as shown in (27), and relativizing verbs after the person
marker, as shown in (28).

SINGLE VERB CONSTRUCTIONS WITH LEXICAL VERBS, AND
NOTES ON WORD ORDER AND ALIGNMENT
16.1. Introduction
Chapter XVI explores the syntactic constructions which involve only one lexical
verb as a main ""nite verb. The discussion begins with some notes on word order in
§16.2, followed by a description of the Wampis alignment pattern in §16.3, which
constitutes a typologically uncommon syntactic pattern. Next, §16.4 describes the
intransitive construction in Wampis. After a short note on copular constructions §16.5,
§16.6 and §16.7 describe the transitive and ditransitive construction in Wampis,
respectively. Finally, §16.8 and §16.9 describe the Wampis quotative and possession
constructions, respectively.
16.2. Notes on constituent order
In Wampis, the most basic verbal construction is a simple intransitive clause;
that is, an intransitive verb marked for aspect, tense, person, and mood. The verb can
stand alone to achieve a predication, not other constituent is needed.","[743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750]"
"850CHAPTER XX
RELATIVIZATION, COMPLEMENTATION AND OTHER COMPLEX
CONSTRUCTIONS
20.1. Introduction
This chapter describes the main strategies for relativization, complementation
and other complex constructions. The chapter is functionally motivated, as
relativization, complementation and the other complex constructions described in this
chapter employ di$erent morphosyntactic strategies, specially nominalization (as
de""ned in Chapter XV) and subordination (as de""ned in Chapter XIX).
The structure of the chapter is as follows: §20.2–§20.3 provide notes on
relativization and complementation in Wampis, respectively; §20.4 describes some
adverbial constructions involving nominalization; ""nally, §20.5 describes the Wampis
equivalent of a tautological in""nitive construction.
20.2. Relativization
A relative clause is one that functions as a modi""er of a noun. Relativization is a
nominalization process in Wampis. Relative clauses in Wampis are typicallypostnominal, a syntactic property that they share with adjectives and appositional
851phrases. There are two major relativization constructions in Wampis. The ""rst involves
Set II nominalizaers -u ‘Subject nominalizer’ and -mau ‘Non-subject nominalizer’ (see
Chapter XV for a description of nominalizers). Both nominalizers can attach to an
aspectualized stem.
20.2.1. Relative clauses with encliticized demonstrative
The encliticized relative clause construction in Wampis consists of a verb that
can carry aspect, tense and person, but not mood information. In terms of its internal
structure, this construction preserves the argument structure of ""nite clauses (i.e. the
arguments of the relativized verb receive case marking) and the relativized verb always
occurs in ""nal position. In terms of its external structure, the relativized verb is
in/ected for its syntactic role in the matrix clause (2). However, when relativized with a
demonstrative, the copula a does not carry any verbal morphology (1). Relative clauses
with encliticized demonstratives can be externally-headed (1) or internally-headed (3).

20.2.2. Relatives clauses with Set II nominalizers -u and -mau
Relative clauses with Set II nominalizers -u and -mau can be headless, externallyheaded or internally-head in Wampis (see discussion below for illustrations). In terms of
the internal grammar of the relative clause, though relativized (i.e. nominalized) verbs
retain certain verbal morphology, they are not fully in/ected as main, independent
verbs are (see examples here, and Chapter XV for more details). In object relative
clauses, the relativized verb in Wampis does not assign case to its object, the head of a
relative clause. Thus, even when Wampis nominalizations allow for some verbal
structure (they occur in aspectual stems, preferred order is verb-""nal), relative clauses
in the language do not possess certain internal grammar characteristics that are related
to a ""nite verb, such as the marking of core-argument NPs and, more obviously, full
""nite morphology. As for the external grammar exhibited by relative clauses in Wampis,
it is basically that of a nominal, being able to receive most case/oblique and discourse853related markers that a Wampis NP can usually take.
20.2.2.1. Externally and internally-headed relative clauses
Externally-headed relative clauses have their head outside the relative clause.
The most frequently in externally-headed relative clauses is Head-Modi""er. Internallyheaded relative clauses have their head inside the relative clauses. When the common
argument is the subject of the relative clause, the Set I nominalizer -u ‘Subject
nominalizer’ is used. Example (4) illustrates the use of the nominalizer -u in an
externally-head relative clause. The head noun is a core argument of the main verb, in
this case the subject. There is a gap strategy employed by the construction, symbolized
by ∅ in the morphemic analysis line.

Relativization with -u in which the common argument is the object of the main
verb is rare in the data gathered for Wampis. In (5) the accusative marker only occurs
854attached to the last element of the object of the main verb, which happens to be the
nominalized structure.

know-HAB.PT-NMLZ=COP.3+DECL
‘He knew the person that was coming to ""ght him.’
In some other cases, such as in (6), the head and the relativized verb share the
accusative marker.290 This is analyzed as a case of a nominalized clause (‘that was
swimming’ in the example below) in an appositive construction with another noun
(t͡sunki ‘water being’ in the example below).

In the following example, the object relative clause shares the focus marker =ka
with other members of the NP because of the presence of the demonstrative, which
triggers agreement of =ka among members of an NP (cf. §8.3.1). The object290. The only case where the accusative marker occurs in other elements of a NP is when a
demonstrative is present. Demonstratives in Wampis make it obligatory that other nominal and
adjectival/modifying elements in the NP occur with the accusative =na and the focus =ka. See

From the above examples, the next rule of metrical high tone assignment can be
posited:
Rule of metrical high tone assignment in Wampis: A metrical high tone is given to
the left-most prominent constituent in the iambic structure.
247This rule predicts that a metrical high tone occurs in the ""rst foot counting from
the left. The foot is right-headed, thus the second mora receives the metrical high tone

Jaime Germán Peña
Doctor of Philosophy
Department of Linguistics
December 2015
Title: A Grammar of WampisThis dissertation constitutes the ""rst attempt at describing the grammar of
Wampis (Spanish: Huambisa), a language spoken in the Peruvian Amazon. Wampis
belongs to the so-called Jivaroan family of languages and is closely related to sister
languages Awajun, Shuar, Shiwiar and Achuar. The grammar introduces the Wampis
people and some aspects of their culture and history before analyzing the major aspects
of the language from a grammatical perspective.
Wampis possesses a complex prosodic system that mixes features of tone and
stress. Vowel elision processes pervade most morphophonological processes.
Nasalization is also present and spreads rightward and leftward through continuants
and vowels. Every word in Wampis needs at least one high tone, but more can occur in
a word.
Morphologically, Wampis is a very rich language. Nouns and especially verbsivhave very robust morphology. A#xes and enclitics contribute di$erent meanings to
words. Some morphemes codify semantic categories that are not grammatically codi""ed
in many other languages, such as sudden realization, apprehensive and mirative
modalities. An outstanding feature of Wampis is the pattern of argument indexation on
the verb, which follows an uncommon pattern in which the verb agrees with the object
(and not with the subject) if the object is a Plural Speech Act participant. Parallel to this
pattern of argument indexation is the typologically uncommon pattern of object
marking in Wampis, whereby a third person object noun phrase is not marked as an
object if the subject is a ""rst plural, second singular or second plural person.
Wampis exhibits a nominative-accusative alignment. All notional objects (direct,
indirect, object of applicative) are treated identically in the syntax. The preferred order
is A P V.
Wampis also possesses a sophisticated system of participant tracking, which is
instantiated in the grammar via switch-reference markers. Another typologically
uncommon feature of Wampis is the presence of a sub-system of switch-reference
markers that track a participant that is not a subject.
Throughout the twenty-one chapters of this grammar, other issues of Wampis
related to di$erent areas of phonology, morphology and syntax are also addressed and
described from a functional and a typological perspective.vCURRICULUM VITAE

"Table 17.2. Wampis copula clitics.
TypeSAPNon-SAPDeclarative=aita ~ =ita=aiti ~ =itiInterrogative=aita ~ =ita=aita ~ =itaExclamative=aita ~ =ita=aita ~ =itaPreterit=ia=iaThe copula clitics are used when the reference is present declarative,753interrogative and exclamative—in the latter, usually expressing surprise. The copula
clitic =aita ~ =ita is used for SAP subjects, whereas the clitic =aiti ~ =iti is used for
non-SAP, 3 person subjects. There is a copula for past reference, =ia which
rdoccasionally occurs in the data. This preterit copula clitic seems to be declining in use,
as for most referents in the past the copula verb, not the clitic, is used.
Examples (57), (58) and (59) illustrate the use of the copula clitics in attributive, proper
inclusion and equative clauses, respectively.
(57) najóowɛɛthi
naiau=aita-hi
tall=COP-1PL.SBJ+DECL
‘We are tall.’(58) ɛ́ɛʃmankuiti
áiʃmaŋku=iti
man=COP.3+DECL
‘He is a man.’(59) ámɨ jat͡surúitmɨ
amɨ iat͡su-ru=ita-mɨ
2SGbrother-1SG=COP-2SG.SBJ+DECL‘You are my brother.’
An interesting note regarding the order of morphemes in interrogative clauses is
that the question marker =ka comes before the copula clitic, hinting at a more recent754grammaticalization of the clitics:
(60) warí tumɛ́int͡sukɛit?
uari ̃ tu-mai-inu-t͡su=ka=aita
what say-POT-NMLZ-INFER-Q=COP
‘How can it be said?
The next example illustrates the use of the copula clitics in exclamative setinclusion clauses. Notice that the question marker =ka can optionally occur in
exclamative sentences and may be being reanalyzed as a non-declarative marker. If the
question marker =ka occurs, the order of the morphemes is the same as in
interrogatives, i.e. the question marker precedes the copula clitic. Note that the negative
is used in this case to emphasize the idea of surprise of the expression, not in its literal
‘negation’ meaning.
(61) auʃa ɲawánt͡ʃukɛit!
au=ʃa
iauã-́ t͡ʃau=ka=aita
DIST=ADDdog-NEG.NMLZ=Q=COP.EXCL‘That is a jaguar!’
The sentence in (62) below contains an example of the use of the preterite
copula clitic. I only have a handful of occurrences of this morpheme in my data, and it
is apparently not very productive. For comparison, a question in present tense is also
presented in (63). In the data for Wampis, the copula can refer to the remote or recent
past. Notice that Overall (2007) reports a cognate remote past copula su#x -ya in755Awajun.
(62) jája óuʃa
ia=iaau=ʃawho=COP.PTDIST=ADD‘Who was that?’(63) jɛ́it óuʃa
ia=itaau=ʃawho=COPDIST=ADD‘Who is that?’
In addition, I was told by one of my teachers that a sentence like (64), which
was pronounced with the clitic, should be transcribed as presented in (65); i.e.
""corrected"" with a fully conjugated copula verb. It is possible thus that the copula clitic
=ia comes from the homophonous remote past tense marker -ia that is present in (65).
The latter might have been reanalyzed after the remote past stem a-ia (Copula-Remote
Past) was phonetically reduced.

The existential construction in Wampis, as is to be expected, is based on the
existential verb a. A location can (and usually) occur(s). The basic existential
construction is:
NP (LOC) Exist
The LOC is typically either an NP, a locational word or an adverb and it is
always marked with a locative marker. The NP subject is always nominative. The next
examples illustrate the use of existential clauses.
(66) ampúʃ numíɲam ájawɛɛ
ampuʃanumi=namaaia-ua-iowltree=LOCexist.PL-ua-i‘There are owls in the tree.’(67) namák junkúnamu áwɛi

naɨka apiha-mau
ropepininka=numafold.pfv-NMLZ bowl.type=LOCa-ua-i
exist-3.SBJ-DECL‘There is a folded rope in the bowl.’757Recall that the existential verb a has no TAM restrictions attested in the data.
Morphologically, the existential verb is characterized by having a plural suppletive
allomorph aia, and by receiving the negative marker -t͡su, as explained previously in
§17.5.2.
17.5.3.3.1. Possession with existential a + applicative
The existential verb a may be su#xed with an applicative to create a possessive
stem; the possessive function might have originated in a benefactive use of the
applicative. Unlike the original existential verb a, the possessive stem with the
applicative is structurally transitive. In this possessive construction, the possessed thing
appears as the subject of the verb and the possessor as the object. The possessor is
indexed as an object on the verb if the possessor is a Speech Act Participant (SAP) as in
(69); third persons do not have an overt verbal object marker and thus are left
unmarked (70). Note that the possessed thing (the grammatical subject in the
construction) can occur without being marked as possessed, as in (71), but semantically
it is understood as possessed (hence the reason why this construction is considered as a
possession construction). The possessor can occur in an overt NP marked with the
accusative (71)—but two overt NP arguments of the verb are very rare in natural758speech, an overt NP possessor is rare.

arutammi=napower.vision 1SG=ACCa-ru-tu-a-ua-i
exist-APPL-1SG.OBJ-IPFV-3.SBJ-DECL‘I have an Arutam power’
The marking of Plural SAP’s possessor (the grammatical objects) on the verb
show a di$erent (and uncommon) pattern, as Wampis argument indexation is
morphologically and semantically complex (see §14.3.3 for details). For 1 and 2 plural
possessors, the markings on the verb vary: the possessed thing no longer formally occurs
as the subject of the verb. Instead both the object and subject markers, both referring
to the possessor, occur at the same time. Thus, no indication of the possessed thing
(a third person subject) overtly appears as the subject on the verb, as happens for the
other grammatical persons/numbers. Notice, however, that this is actually the way759Wampis marks the situation of a 3 person subject acting on a 1 or 2 plural object (i.e.
the 3 → PL.SAP scenario): the 1 or 2 plural argument is marked in both the object and
subject verb slots. Examples (72) and (73) illustrate this pattern for 1pl and 2pl
possessor:
(72) arútam i ́iɲa arútramɨahi
Arutamii=napower.vision 1PL=ACCa-ru-turama-a-hi

Arutamami=napower.vision 2SG=ACCa-ru-turama-a-rumɨ
exist-APPL-1PL/2.OBJ-IPFV-2PL.SBJ+DECL‘You (PL) have an Arutam power.’
17.5.3.3.2. Predicate locatives
Locative constructions typically involve a construal in which a Figure (an NP
that is being identi""ed) is located on a Ground (an NP that constitutes the referential
location of the Figure) (Langacker 1987; Levinson & Wilkins 2006; Talmy 2007). Many
languages employ copulas or existential verbs for the expression of spatial relations.
Other employ posture verbs or positional verbs. For Wampis, the results of a study
about the expression of spatial relations that I carried out were presented at the 2015
Society for the Study of Indigenous Languages of the Americas Annual Meeting (Peña7602015). Because of time and space constraints, only a summary is presented here.
Of the types of spatial relations as de""ned in Ameka & Levinson (2007), Wampis
actually employs most of them. Therefore, it is better to speak of di$erent strategies or
constructions for Wampis, rather than trying to ""t a strict typological parameters255
(Grinevald 2006).
The copulas and the existential can be used in predications that express spatial
notions, but a locative postposition must occur on the predicate NP, as can be observed
in (74)–(75).

nunanki mesa=nama aia-ua-ithatspear table=LOCexist.PL-3-DECL'There are spears on the table.'
Using the copula and the existential are by no means the only strategy that
Wampis uses for locational predicates. Wampis possesses a fairly sophisticated lexical
pool of verbs that are used in locatives constructions (especially for the subdomain of255. Grinevald (2006), working on a varied sample of Amerindian languages, has proposed
“intermediate” systems that allow for continuos, non-discrete, categories.","[793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798, 799, 800, 801]"

co-occur together in the same phrase.
(23)
*nu ʃuara ti ́i imá sɨnt͡ʃi kakárama áhakaruiti
*nu ʃuara imá ti ́i sɨnt͡ʃi kakárama áhakaruiti
Adverbs ʃiira ‘very’ and ʃint͡ʃi ‘strongly’ can occur together, in which case the
order is ʃiira sɨnt͡ʃi (the reverse order is prohibited):
(24) húka ʃi ́ir sɨ ́nt͡ʃi úuntaiti
hu=kaʃiirasɨnt͡ʃiuunta=itiPROX=FOCverystronglybig=COP.3+DECL‘This is way too big.’
Canonically, AdjPs follow their noun head in the NP. The reverse order, N AdjP,
is pragmatically marked—it usually highlights the adjective over the noun and is
accompanied with a slightly forceful prosody.
9.7. Syntactic operations of adjectives
In Wampis, adjectives can have an attributive function, in which case they
modify the head of a NP (§9.7.1). Adjectives can also have a predicative function,
occurring in copular and verbless clauses (§9.7.2). In addition, there is a range of
constructions associated with the expression of comparison and superlative degrees
(§9.7.3).
4389.7.1. Adjectives as modi!ers of head of NP
In Wampis, adjectives can also occur as modi""ers in NPs. The next examples
illustrate adjectives modifying nouns:
(25) ʃuár náki núka takás júat͡ʃu
[ʃuara naki] nu=kataka-sã iu-a-t͡ʃauperson lazywork-SUB\3.SS EAT-IPFV-NEG.NMLZNON.VIS=FOC‘A lazy person doesn’t eat working (i.e. it su$ers to eat).’ (Lit.: A lazy person, that [person], working, does not eat.’(26) núwa aŋkán t͡sakakú mat͡sátɨa anú
[nuaankanta]t͡saka-ka-uwomanfreegrow-INTENS-NMLZmat͡satɨ-aa=nube.together.IPFV-IPFVCOP=NON.VIS‘The single women that were grown up’
9.7.2. Adjectives in copular and non-verbal constructions
In Wampis, adjectives are much more commonly found in predicative function
as complements of a copula than as modi""ers to nouns. The following examples
illustrate the occurrence of adjectives in predicate adjectives constructions:
(27) niŋkʲa
̃́
jat͡ʃɛ́iti
ni ̃=kaiat͡ʃa=iti3SG=FOCwise=COP.3+DECL‘He is wise.’439(28) najówɛithɛɛ
naiau=aita-ha-i
tall=COP-1SG.SBJ-DECL
‘I am tall.’169
Adjectives can also occur in non-verbal predicates without a copula:
(29) wi ́kʲa najóo
ui=kanaiau1SG=FOCtall‘I am tall.’
Interestingly, other unrelated languages of the Amazon also show a preference
for the predicative function of adjective. For instance, Ese Ejja (Takanan) apparently
distinguishes two lexical classes: attributive adjectives and predicative adjectives, and
predicative adjectives are far more frequent in that language (Vuillermet 2012).
9.7.3. Gradability
Adjectives express properties that are gradable: they can be compared in terms
of “degree” (less, equal, more) or occur in superlative constructions. The following
sections describe di$erent constructions associated with the property of gradability
where Wampis adjectives occur.","[477, 478, 479, 480]"
"Table 3.8. Assimilation of /a/

Beasley and Pike (1957) nor Jakway et al. (1987) report them. Therefore, this change
seems to be following a relatively transparent direction towards the direction of the
quality of a raised vowel, e.g. *ai > ɛi > ɛɛ. This change has not been reported for
other Jivaroan languages. The word /auhu/ ‘common potoo’ (Nyctibius griseus) seems to
be “immune” (probably because of its apparent onomatopoetic nature) to the rule of77. This may be due to the the rather infrequent combination of these vowels in that order.

I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Wampis people who taught me
so much more than their language, specially to Juan Luis Nuningo Puwai and his
family, Shapiom Noningo Sesén, Atilio Nuningo Noningo, Andrés Nuningo Graña, Dina
Ananco Ahuananchi, Lidia Wajarai, Clara Navarro, Josué Yacum, Eder Yacum, and
Óscar Jimpikit and his family. I am grateful to the Wampis leaders Juan Luis Nuningo,
Julio Hinojosa and Alfonso Graña for allowing me to carry out my research and for
helping me make contacts in di$erent communities of Kanus.
In Jaén, my appreciation to the people of Centro Waimaku and to the Carranza
family for welcoming me at their house at di$erent times while traveling for ""eld work.
I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Professor Doris L. Payne, for
supporting me all these years. I really do not know where I would be without Doris’
guidance; certainly not ""nishing a dissertation. She has very patiently read and re-read
through every piece of this work and has given my chaotic thoughts a legible form. Our
conversations have greatly enriched my understanding not only of language, but of how
to do research in general. Scott DeLancey and Spike Gildea are great professors and
scholars, and great people. As their student or assistant, I have learned a lot from them.
I am honored to have them in my committee and grateful for their comments and
criticism. I am grateful to Claudia Holguín for supporting my project since we met for
the ""rst time and for her comments on my work.
ixAll of my friends at the Department of Linguistics of the University of Oregon
have helped me keep my sanity at acceptable levels, especially Rosa Vallejos (and Óscar
and Álvaro), Michael Ahland, Yolanda Valdez. Shahar Shirtz, Manuel Otero, Danielle
Barth, Ellen Kress and Matt Stave provided insightful comments on the Wampis data or
helped with my questions about English. My thanks also to all of my professors and sta$
at the Department of Linguistics and to the people at Romance Languages, with whom I
worked when I started my graduate career in Oregon. My research was supported by
the Department of Linguistics, a 2008 Summer Research Grant by the Center for Latino/
Latina and Latin American Studies, and a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant
awarded by the National Science Foundation (Award 1226222).
I would be nowhere without the love and support of my parents, Isaac Jaime
and Zadith. My sister Ketty has been my best friend since before I was born, and I am
always happy to see her, her husband Yuri and my nephew Iván. My in-laws are always
supportive of our endeavors, I am especially grateful to Teresa Arellano for everything
she has done for us.
I am indebted to Adriana Da Silva, who has helped me greatly with the maps.
Adriana not only found time to help me, but also to be a great mother to our sons
Joaquín Alejandro, Nicolás Jaime and Octavio Carlo. All of you are the greatest thing to

INTRODUCTION
1.1. Introduction
This dissertation o$ers a comprehensive grammar of the Wampis (Huambisa)
language, as it is currently spoken in the Santiago river1 area of Peru. The language
name is written <Wampís> (the underlying form is /uampisa/, which is pronounced
[wampi ́s]) by the speakers); therefore, assuming there is no accent mark in the English
alphabet, throughout this dissertation I will use the term Wampis to refer to the
language. The present work is based mainly on the variety spoken in the Middle
Santiago, in the communities of Puerto Galilea, Huabal and Boca Chinganaza; and on

di$erences between the Middle and Upper Santiago varieties occur and will be referred
to in some parts of this work, no major statements about Wampis internal variation will
be made (however, some basic notes on this topic are given in §1.6.1). The claims made
in this work are based on the analysis of primary data gathered via extensive ""eldwork

Other lexical types of verbs
12.5.1. Lexically negative verbs
Some verbs in Wampis are lexically inherently negative, i.e. they do not538necessitate any negative morpheme in order to change their polarity. Examples of this
are tuhina ‘be unable, have di#culty’, nakita ‘not want’203 and kaninma204 ‘not ""t (in a
space)’.
12.5.2. Verbs that lexicalize a speci!c type of patient or location
The lexical content of Wampis verb roots can have very rich/speci""c content
and provide inherent information about the object or location that need not be
mentioned—of course, many of these meanings are culturally-speci""c. Some verbs also
include manner information in their lexical representation. To give a sense of what can
be found in the Wampis lexicon (at the level of the root) here is a short list of verb roots
that are di#cult to gloss with one or two words:
(8)
aɨpa‘leave/put on /oor or bed’apa‘put a bite in mouth (also applies to putting bites of manioc during the process
of preparing manioc beer)’apuha ‘put on ""nger’
at͡sɨnu ‘put on a garment for the head’203. The source of this verb is probably the adjective naki ‘lazy’. The portion -ta may be a
variant of an old verbalizer -tu.
204. The underlying form of this verb likely is kaninVma, as the third vowel would be always
dropped due to the vowel elision process explained in Chapter VI. Thus the root would be kaninV
plus the re/exive -ma. Synchronically, I have not found an etymon for the (apparent) root
kaninV.","[578, 579]"

deleted. For instance, the surface realization of t͡ʃit͡ʃa-t͡ʃau ‘quiet’, in (26) above, is
[t͡ʃi ́t͡ʃat͡ʃu].
10.4.6. Case
Case marking here is viewed in a stricter sense of ""the morphosyntactic
481characterization of noun phrases that is imposed by the structure within which the noun
phrase occurs"" (Payne 1997: 100). True case markers in Wampis are the Nominative
(which is unmarked), the Accusative, the Genitive and the Vocative. Case does not seem
to be a coherent morphosyntactic category in Wampis, as some cases are marked by
phonological means and therefore tightly related to the noun root or derived stem, and
other cases, like the accusative, occur in the form of an enclitic that may or may not be
borne by the head noun.
10.4.6.1. Nominative
Wampis is a nominative-accusative language. Nominative case is zero-marked in
Wampis. Intransitive and transitive lexical S and A argument NPs are treated the same
way in the language in having no overt case marker, and in occurring generally as the
""rst core argument in a sentence.

Noun phrases that are Objects of a verb are marked with the morpheme =na. In
fact, =na marks a core argument of the verb that is “not-subject”, as it also marks the
other argument of a ditransitive verb, as will be shown shortly.
(30) napín karámrumhɛɛ
[napi]=nakarama-ru-ma-ha-iboa=ACCdream-APPL-REC.PT-1SG.SBJ-DECL‘I dreamt of a boa (to my detriment).’
The enclitic =na usually occurs in the last element of an NP:
(31) út͡ʃi ʃikápt͡ʃit͡ʃin súsaru

An important note regarding the realization of the accusative =na is in order.
Because =na frequently appears as the last morphological element of the noun word (or
phrase—only discourse-level morphemes come after case clitics), its vowel usually
undergoes apocope. This apparently has given rise to a further phonetic change in the
accusative, whereby sometimes the nasal consonant /n/ is also lost if =na occupies the
last position. In those cases, the only marking of the accusative is placement of high
483tone—remember that =na induces shift of high tone one mora to the right, as described
in Chapter VI. It will shown that this process is also the origin of the genitive marking
in Wampis. For instance, a common collocation in Wampis is to use the verb hu ‘take’
with nanki [náŋki] ‘spear’ as its object. Often times, the noun nanki surfaces as
[naŋkí]188 when it is the object NP, with the placement of high tone as the only
evidence of accusative marking:
(33) naŋkí húki ̃
nankíhu-ki ̃spear\ACCtake-WHILE.MOVING\3SG.SS‘Having taken the spear…’
However, when more morphology is added to the nominal piece, the underlying
/n/ surfaces. This is not optional; the /n/ always surfaces when another morpheme cooccurs after the accusative, as in (34). Further evidence that =na is present
underlyingly is the surfacing of the entire form /na/ if the morphophonological
environment is appropriate. In (35), the vowel of =na is not deleted because the
(potentially) resulting the cluster [ɲk] in the coda is prohibited. Thus, consider:
(34) naŋkínʃa húki ̃
nanki=na=ʃahu-ki ̃spear=ACC=ADDtake-WHILE.MOVING\3SG.SS‘Having taken the spear too…’188. But notice that this varies with [naŋkín], where the nasal consonant occurs at the end.","[520, 521, 522, 523, 524]"

Another way to classify manner adverbs is according to their morphological
properties. Similarly to Awajun (Overall 2007: 168), there are two types of manner
381adverbs in Wampis: 1) Adverbs that take person markers (a small subclass), and 2)
Adverbs that do not take person markers.
First, adverbs that take person markers use the same-subject su#xes used in
subordinate verbs (§19.4). Table 8.11 lists the items from Table 8.10 that form this
small subclass of person-marking adverbs (this is an exhaustive list based on my
corpus).","[420, 421, 422]"
"• Interestingly, however, glides are not treated as consonants for the purpose of word""nal vowel elision (apocope). In (15), just like the last vowel /ɨ/ is deleted in the word
‘root’, it would be expected that the last vowel /a/ of the word ‘from the puddle’ be
deleted; however, it is not deleted.

A potential problem of analysis arises around the distinction between surface
epenthetic glide and allophonic glide forms of an underlying vowel. In some cases, if
the nature of the underlying vowel is not determined, the phonological derivation may
result in unprecedented word formations. For instance, it can be posited that the word
[júwi] ‘squash’ can have two possible underlying representations: /iui/ or /iuui/. In the
""rst hypothesized case, /iui/, rules of initial glide formation (rule B) and C (medial
glide insertion) could derive [júwi]. But notice that rules must be applied in order, thus
rule A.i (intervocalic glide formation) must apply ""rst. However, in that case, the
derivation should be [i ́wi], not [júwi] as the word occurs. Hence, the only way to derive
[júwi], with the rules as claimed to be ordered above, is by positing an underlying form
169/iuui/ which results in [júwi] after applying the rule in A.ii and B:
(16)
/iuui/ ‘squash’
Intervocalic glide formation (Rule A.ii): iuwi
Initial glide formation (Rule B): juwi
Output: [júwi]
The following examples show that regarding glides, following the rules is
important for the correct derivation of similar surface forms:
(17)
a. /ui/→[wi ́i]‘1SG’b. /uui/→[uwi ́] ‘peach-palm’a. /ia/→[jáa]‘who’b. /iia/→[ijá]‘fall down’a. /iua/→[i ́wa] ‘mythological character’b. /iuua/→[júwa] ‘cousin of female’a. /t͡ʃiua/→[t͡ʃi ́wa]b. /t͡ʃuanka/→[t͡ʃuáŋ] or [t͡ʃuwáŋ](18)(19)(20)
‘trumpeter (bird sp.)’
88‘buzzard’In (17), if the word for ‘peach-palm’ were /ui/ phonemically, we would expect88. The realization [t͡ʃuwáŋ] shows an optional epenthetic glide [w].","[209, 210]"
"Table 3.5. Wampis vowel inventoryHighFrontCentralBackiɨɨ̃uaãĩLowũ3.6.1. Vowel quality
In order to accurately describe vowel quality, measurements of the ""rst and
second formants of vowels for thirty Wampis words were taken (details of the study are
described below). The results of these measurements allow us to know the actual place
of articulation of vowels over acoustic space.
One Wampis woman, 29 years old, and one Wampis man, 42 years old, were
recorded saying a series of thirty words. The words were recorded three times in
isolation and one time within the carrier sentence [tʃitʃámka _____________ táhi núwɛiti]
which translates as ‘the word ___________ is what we say’ (this carrier sentence was
suggested by my Wampis teachers). Measurements of F1 and F2 formants were then136taken using PRAAT, a free software for phonetic analysis developed by Paul Boersma
and David Weenink (http://www.praat.org). The measurements of F1 and F2 were
made at the mid-point of the vowel to diminish possible consonant perturbation e$ects.

"8.5.2. Interrogative words in non-interrogative constructions
In many languages, interrogative words are similar or identical to pronouns,
especially demonstrative pronouns. Thus they often further function as relativization
pronouns or complementizers, a common extended function of demonstratives. In
Wampis, interrogative words are not clearly synchronically associated to any
demonstrative, as far as I can tell. However, interrogative words can occur in di$erent
non-interrogative constructions such as relative clauses, suggesting a possible historical
link to a demonstrative. With regard to relative clauses, ia ‘who’, tui ̃ ‘where’ and wari ̃
‘what’ can occur in “headless” relatives clauses. All examples of relative clauses
involving the interrogative ia ‘who’ show it in a fossilized form iaki < ia=ki ‘who-RHET’.

In addition, uruka ‘how’ occurs in adverbial simile constructions. In simile
constructions, uru-based interrogative words are treated as verbal bases in that they
have to be nominalized and received a copula in order to function as adverbials. It is
possible that this is a syntactic calque from Spanish, where <cómo/como> ‘how/like’
also functions in simile constructions. An example of a simile construction with uruka is
given in (71), with the nominalized variant uruku:

The preceding discussion has described the stress system of Wampis as well as
provided acoustic evidence for it. Now I discuss the processes of vowel elision, which
are one of the most interesting and complex phenomena in Wampis. The basic
principles of vowel elision have been introduced already in previous chapters (cf.
§4.2.1).
Vowel elision is pervasive in Wampis, as it is in other Jivaroan languages
251(Payne 1990a; Corbera Mori 1994; Overall 2007). Vowels are systematically elided
word-internally and word-""nally if certain conditions are met.
6.4.5. Word-!nal and word-internal vowel elision
Word-""nal (apocope) and word-internal (syncope)118 vowel elision apply strictly
in that order in Wampis. Generally speaking, they apply in words of more than two
moras.119 They operate on both simplex and morphologically complex words.
Apocope: Word-""nally, vowels in a CV sequence (where C is any stop except a
glide) are deleted.
Syncope: After vowel apocope, the third vowel starting from the left, and every
other alternate vowel in a CV.C cluster are deleted.
There are some peculiarities and exceptions to the above rule, which will be
described in the following sections, but these rules apply to a large portion of words in
Wampis.
I argue that apocope and syncope are for the most part another manifestation of118. In previous works on Awajun, the term syncope have been used to mean word internal
vowel elision in general (not only of unstressed vowels) (Payne 1990a; Overall 2007). I use
syncope in the same sense.
119. Underlyingly the last syllable in a word is phonologically either CV or V in Wampis, since
there can be only vowels in word-""nal position. This was described in Chapter IV.","[290, 291, 292]"
"With regard to being the head of an NP, adjectives in Wampis cannot assume
this function. For the related language Awajun, Overall (2007: 142) mentions that it is
possible for adjectives to occur in headless NPs. The next example from Awajun
illustrates this construction:
(1) níŋka muúntan ʃináu
nĩ-ka[muunta-na] ʃina-u3SG-FOC [big-ACC]sing+IMPFV-REL‘it (the kúgkup bird) sang with a big voice’ (Lit. it sang a big (one)) (Overall 2007: 142)427I have no attestation of that type of NP in the Wampis database. In fact, notice
that a copula occurs with the adjective in Wampis:
(2) ʃikápt͡ʃia húna amástahmɨ
[ʃikapat͡ʃi=a hu=na]ama-sa-ta-hamɨ[small=COPgive-ATT-IMM.FUT-1SG>2SG+DECLPROX=ACC]‘I am going to give you this little one.’ (Lit.: ‘I am going to give you this [who] is little.’)
The above example shows a relative clause: the copula is relativized with the
proximal demonstrative. The proximal demonstrative, at the same time, functions as the
head of the object NP.
Concerning modi""cation of nouns, nouns can modify the head of an NP;
however, in that case, word order is much looser. In a quick count of 40 NPs from texts
where a noun to noun modi""cation occurs, 75% (=30) of cases observed the modi""er
noun coming before the head. An example is presented in (3).
(3) núu ʃuár páki áhaku ti ́maji
nuʃuara pakiNON.VIS person peccarya-hak-utimajiexist-PT.HAB-NMLZNARR‘That person peccary used to exist.’
This is unlike modi""cation with adjectives, where there is a very strong
preference for Noun-Adjective order. Notice that relative clauses also follow this
pattern, occurring after the noun head. This seems to con""rm that the preferred
position for the modi""cation of the head of the NP is post-nominal. To exemplify this428point, consider adjectives like uunta ‘big’. When uunta is used in a pre-nominal position,
it acquires the meaning of ‘adult person, elder person, respected person’ (by extension,
uunta is used as a noun when meaning ‘elder’ or ‘ancestor’):
(4) úun pirút͡ʃ ʃuarán mãh́ akuiti
uunta Pirut͡ʃi ʃuara=namã=hak-u=itielderkill=HAB.PT-NMLZ=COP.3+DECLPirut͡ʃi person=ACC‘The elder Piruch used to kill people.’
In that respect, uunta can act as a noun, heading an NP:
(5) óo úun Limánmajakɛiti
auuuntaLima=numa=ia=ka=itiMEDadult.personLima=LOC=ABL=Q=COP.3‘Is that guy (i.e. ‘adult person’) from Lima?’
But when uunta occurs post-nominally, it is clearly adjectival:
(6) ou ʃuar úun hɨ ̃áji
auʃuaruunta hɨ ̃ájiMEDpersonbigarrive+HIAF-3.PT+DECL‘That big person just arrived.’
Interestingly, in lexicalized compound nominals that have an adjective
incorporated, the adjective occurs ""rst and there is no possibility at all that the
Adjective-Noun compound can be interpreted as an adjective modifying a noun. For
instance, uun_iauaã is a compoun noun derived from iauaã ‘dog’ and uunta ‘big’. So,
uun_iauaã [uún ɲawaã] ‘jaguar’ is never interpreted as ‘big dog’; the only way to say
‘big dog’ is by using the canonical Noun-Adjective order:429(7) ɲawáã úun
iauaã uunta
dogbig‘big dog’(8) úun ɲawáã
uun_iauaã
‘jaguar’
With regard to possession, unlike nouns, adjectives cannot be possessors in
Wampis. On the other hand, like nouns, adjectives can be possessed, but when they are
possessed, their meaning and function is that of (i.e. they become) a possessed noun.
Thus, when uunta ‘big’ is possessed, it acquires the meaning of ‘elder one’, ‘ancestor’
and can head NPs:
(9) i ́iɲa úuntrika papáŋhɛɛ̃ júha hakáru
iinauunta-ri ̃=kapapanku=hai ̃1PL.GEN ancestor-1PL/2PL/3.POSS=FOC raft=COM
iuhahak-ara-uwalk.in.group HAB.PT-PL-NMLZ
‘Our ancestors used to travel by raft.’
Now compare the following sentences that contain the word ɨsarama ‘long’. In
(10), ɨsarama functions as an adjective, modifying the noun head ‘snake’. Meanwhile, in
(11) ɨsarama is possessed and is functioning as a noun in a genitive construction:430(10) nápi ɨsáram tɨpáwɛɛ

The other points that appear in Table 9.2, such as the morphology associated
with adjectives (including case and postpositions), gradability and derivation of
adjectives, are discussed in detail in the next subsections.
9.5. Morphology associated with adjectives
Adjectives have a unique su#x -taku that derives another adjective that acquires
the meaning equivalent of ‘PROPERTY-ish’. This su#x is explained in §9.8.2.
Adjectives can also receive a restricted number of morphemes that also occur on
noun. Table 9.3 shows the su#xes that are shared by adjectives and nouns.
Table 9.3. Nominal su#xes that can be received by adjectives
MorphemeGloss-t͡ʃi‘Diminutive’-t͡ʃau‘Negative nominalizer’Possessed noun markers (see §9.4)4319.5.1. Diminutive -t͡ʃi with adjectives
The diminutive -t͡ʃi can occur with adjectives as well as nouns. As it is typical of
diminutives, -t͡ʃi does not only express smallness but it also can convey an idea of
endearment. The marking of the diminutive in both the modi""er and head is optional,
but it occurs in the majority of examples from texts. This suggests that the adjective
tends to have some agreement with the noun head when marked with the diminutive.

The negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau and adjectives
Some adjectives can be derived from adjectives, nouns and verbs using the
negative nominalizer -t͡ʃau. One of the functions of verbal nominalization is to modify
432nouns (i.e. via relative clauses), so it seems that through this function -t͡ʃau can derive
items that become primarily modi""cational in function. Speci""cally, -tʃau derives
opposites of certain adjectives, as many do not have a lexical antonym pair. -t͡ʃau is
specially productive with evaluative adjectives. This is an interesting ""nding, as it
reveals a semantic tendency of Wampis lexicon related to adjectives: most adjectives
expressing VALUE are positively oriented and do not have a lexical opposite. Examples
are presented in (11)

Phonologically, adjectives can also host case and adpositional clitics (because of
the very nature of cliticization in Wampis). However no adjective can stand alone and
receive case or adpositional marking. However no adjective can stand alone and receive167. This word almost always occurs as [jumi ́n], but it occurs as [jumi ́ntri ̃] when it receives the
1PL/2PL/3 possessed marker -ri ̃. So, it seems that, synchronically, it is still possible to analyze this
word as having a last /tV/ syllable. The deletion of the last syllable (/tV/) is the consequence of
vowel elision: after V is elided, /t/ is deleted because /nt/ is an impossible coda. V is always
deleted because it is in a position to be deleted. This a very regular Wampis pattern.","[467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473]"

re/exive and reciprocal morphemes. Wampis possesses detransitivizing morphemes,
however they are not productive in the language and therefore their (restricted) use
does not constitute a good practical criterion to distinguish transitive from intransitive
verbs.
Transitivity in Wampis is not sensitive to aspect or tense, but there are other
mechanisms at the level of the clause that depend on the transitivity of the verb. For
instance, a transitive verb can control a subordinated structure with the switch-534reference marker -tatamana (cf. §19.11.1), which indicates that the subject of the
subordinate verb becomes the object of the main verb, as in (1).

In (1), the subject of the subordinated verb (the person who was about to arrive)
is coreferential with the object in the main clause (the one shot and killed). It can be
seen that the lexical transitivity of the verb mã ‘kill’ allows for the use of the switchreference marker -tatamana ‘subject to object’, even when this morpheme is used with
an intransitive verb, such as ‘go’, in the subordinated clause.
In contrast to transitive verbs, intransitive verbs in Wampis can be de""ned by
the following principles:• With intransitive verbs, only one argument (S) may occur as a nominative noun
phrase or pronoun in the same clause. Note that the nominative is zero-marked.

(20)
hapima-ka-ha-i
sweep-INTENS-1SG.SBJ-DECL
‘I just swept.’I call this kind of derived stem the “inner stem” (cf. Table 12.5). What I
understand by “inner stem” is a verbal stem derived with any one of the su#xes that
usually occupy positions 3-5 (which are su#xes that have derivational properties,
beside the valence su#xes) and that form a stem that behaves like a “normal” root; that
is, a stem that can receive again any piece of morphology from positions 1 to 8
depending on the morphosyntactic environment. I do not consider stems derived with
valence su#xes as “inner stems” because they cannot carry another di$erent valence
su#x when they are derived.
From the above discussion, it can be said that a careful examination of some
Wampis verbal morpheme properties shows that there is really no sharp boundaries
between “in/ectional” and “derivational” morphology in the language. Thus, rather
than making a strict divide between derivation and in/ection, I characterize the verbal
morphology by placing the morphemes along a continuum between derivation and550in/ection. I describe the morphemes from -1 to 5 in Table 12.5 as “more derivational”
and the morphemes from 6 to 8 as “more in/ectional”. The “more derivational”
morphemes constitute the derivational level of the verb—they will be studied in
Chapter XIII. I consider them “more derivational” in the sense that they most frequently
create a stem that is in/ectable, i.e. a stem that can carry markings of person, tense, and
mood. Aspectual morphemes are also obligatory to use a Wampis verb in discourse, but
because of their position in the verbal piece and their derivational properties, they are
considered in the derivational level. Thus, the root or the “inner stem” plus any one (or
more, depending on the desired actual meaning) of the su#xes from -1 to 5 form what I
call the level of the “stem”. On the other hand, the “more in/ectional” morphemes,
those related to tense, subject and mood, are considered to form the in/ectional level—
they are studied in Chapter XIV.
Wampis is a language with a very interesting feature in the verb structure: most
su#xes that are used for aspect are, at their very basic, meaning-changing su#xes.
Despite being derivational, they are also obligatory, for aspect is an obligatory category
of the independent verb. The imperfective is in a contrastive paradigmatic relation with
the durative and the “aktionsart” su#xes, and both aktionsart and the durative su#xes551have clear meaning-changing properties. The relevance of such a language in relation to
the larger theoretical body of literature discussing in/ection and derivation needs to be
explored more in detailed and is one important topic for future research.
Thus, for Wampis, one more or less clear divide between derivation and
in/ection can be stablished after slot 5 in Table 12.5 above, whereas Aspect represents
a cline between in/ection and derivation. Tense, subject/person and mood are
in/ectional in that independent verb needs an indication of these categories in order to
be used in the communicative event.
The closest positions to the verb root are occupied by valency-changing
morphemes, including the only pre""x in the language. There is also a su#x -nin ‘almost’
that is rather aspectual but occurs in position 1, close to the root. Positions 2 and 7 are
generally related to the marking of object and subject, respectively. However, the
morphological access to these positions varies as it is dependent upon a hierarchical
agreement system. This is explained in Chapter XIV. Aktionsart/Aspectual morphemes
and the potential morphemes occupy position 3. These morphemes create verb stems
that can be in/ected. The negative su#x -t͡ʃa and the plural perfective su#x -ara occupy
the next two slots. The plural -ara, though marking non-imperfective stems, does not552belong to the same paradigm of other aktionsart/aspectual morphemes. To summarize,
all of the morphemes from positions 0-5 belong to a ""rst level of morphology that is
roughly related to “derivation” as most of them possess some degree of derivational
properties. The second level of verbal morphology roughly correspond to “in/ection”.
Morphemes in this level involve tense, person (mostly subject) and mood.
12.8. Verb conjugation patterns
There are several conjugation patterns in Wampis that have to do with
morphological changes in the verb stem in imperfective or perfective contexts. The
simplest relevant verb stem may coincide with root, the “inner root”, or be a stem
created with a root or “inner root” with any derivational su#x prior to position 3. The
changes to the verb stem are not morphophonologically predictable. The imperfective
and perfective stems are created with the imperfective and aktionsart su#xes,
respectively. These su#xes occupy the same morphological slot that the durative,
present habitual and potential (position 3 in Table 12.5). However, the durative,
present habitual and the potential su#xes do not change the form of the verb stem. The
su#xes that occupy position 3 in the verbal piece are listed in Table 12.6. The term
“aktionsart” is explained in Chapter XIII.","[589, 590, 591, 592, 593]"

prototypically used as attributes, and “action-roots” are prototypically used as
predicates. In (11), the “object-root” nua has a referential function (it refers to the
object ‘woman’), the “property-root” pɨ ́nkɨra has a modifying function (it modi""es
‘woman’), and the “action-root” uɨ has a predicating function (note it has to be in/ected

aunuapɨ ́nkɨra uɨ-a-ua-iDISTwoman goodgo-IPFV-3.SBJ-DECL‘That good woman is going.’Of course, in Wampis as in many other languages, not all nouns denote physical
objects (there can be abstract objects/concepts), not all verbs denote volitional actions,
and not all adjectives denote properties (or certain properties are not denoted by
adjectives). These terms refer to prototypes of each major category. Understanding
grammatical categories in terms of prototypes allows us to choose key lexemes to start
305checking the morphosyntax of a language. This does not mean that I will pre-judge that
categories such as “verb” or “adjective” exist in Wampis a priori; rather, I take this
approach to grammatical categories as both methodologically helpful to establish
prototypical members of major classes and theoretically grounded in the study of
human cognition (Langacker 1976; Miller & Johnson-Laird 1976; Langacker 1987).
However, the grammatical categories of a language need to be determined by
morphosyntactic properties, to quote Croft: “categories in a particular language are
de""ned by the constructions of the language” (Croft 2001: 85). In that regard, word
classes often cannot be equated across languages. Grammatical categories de""ned for
di$erent languages depend on language-speci""c criteria (Croft 1984; Lazard 1992; Croft
2001; Dryer 2006; Haspelmath 2007).
Accordingly, in the next chapters, for each major word class, I will present a
discussion in terms of their prototypical members, but I will also provide the relevant
morphosyntactic evidence that have helped de""ned such categories in Wampis. As an
example, we have just seen that the concepts of ‘woman’ and ‘good’ have the
prototypical functions of object reference and property modi""cation, respectively. There
is no special morphology associated with these prototypical functions, as shown in (11)306before. However, when ‘woman’ or ‘good’ occur in predicative function, they occur in a
di$erent construction. In other words, when they are used in a function that is di$erent
from their prototypical one, it is “marked” somehow by the language. In this speci""c
case, a copular construction occurs to allow nouns and adjectives to function
predicatively:
(12) óu núwɛiti
aunua=itiDISTwoman=COP.3+DECL‘That is a woman.’(13) óu pɨ ́ŋkɨrɛiti
aupɨ ́nkɨra=aitiDISTgood=COP.3+DECL‘That is good.’
Thus, the fact that nouns and adjectives need to be morphosyntactically treated
to become “similar” to verbs (by adding a copula) to be used predicatively, provides a
""rst piece of evidence for stating that there is a basic di$erence between verbs, and
nouns and adjectives in Wampis (a verb does not need a copula to be used
predicatively). Detailed evidence with plenty of examples will be presented in the
respective chapters where I de""ne the Adjective (Chapter IX), the Noun (Chapter X) and
the Verb (Chapter XII) in Wampis. In addition, Wampis also possesses minor classes,307which are analyzed in Chapter VIII (I include an analysis of Adverbs in this chapter, see
§8.6).
7.5. Fuzzy boundaries and clear-cut boundaries
As often happens in languages around the world, the boundaries between certain
categories are sometimes untidy in Wampis. For instance, nat͡sa ‘single (a person
without a partner)’ can be used referentially, but it can also be used attributively, in
which case it means ‘young’. The same root is used in the verb nat͡sa-ma ‘be timid, be
embarrassed’, although in this case it carries the verbalizer -ma (see §12.6.2). Table 7.2
provides a sample of roots that exhibit “untidy” boundaries, i.e. roots which can be used
in more than one way (referentially, attributively or predicatively) without marking the
root with special (i.e. derivational) morphology. Examples like the ones given in Table
7.2 actually do not abound in Wampis. In fact, at least with reference to the two crosslinguistically major categories of word classes, nouns and verbs, ambiguous or labile
categoriality is usually not an issue in Wampis. In this language, certain roots are
usually used predicatively and certain other roots referentially: there is not a lot of
cross-over or overlap. In more informal words, object-naming roots are not as freely
used in predicative function—or vice versa—unlike, for instance, in English.","[344, 345, 346, 347, 348]"

Nouns

hɨã ‘house’
iauaã ‘dog’
t͡ʃimpui ‘stool’
10.4.2. Diminutive -t͡ʃi
As seen in Table 10.5, the diminutive -t͡ʃi occurs immediately after the noun root
and creates a new noun that has the basic semantics of ‘smaller N’. The historical source
of the diminutive clearly is the noun ut͡ʃi ‘child’. As a su#x -t͡ʃi clearly corresponds to the
canonical [N Adj] word order in Jivaroan languages. Here are some examples of the
diminutive in Wampis:
(2)
numinumi-t͡ʃi‘tree’‘little tree’t͡ʃinkit͡ʃinki-t͡ʃi‘bird’‘little bird’munt͡sumunt͡su-t͡ʃi‘breast’‘little breast’472iauaãiauaã-t͡ʃi‘dog’‘little dog’
The diminutive morpheme has extended usages in which its meaning is not thatof diminutive size or literally ‘little’. Rather, it shares some meanings with Spanish -ito
which itself is not restricted only to indicating small size.
For instance, one use of the Wampis diminutive that is similar to the Peruvian
Spanish diminutive is its use to attenuate temporal or geographical distance. Here is one
example:
(3)
iakiiaki-t͡ʃi‘above’‘a bit further above’
Like in Peruvian Spanish, this does not necessarily mean that the actual distanceis short, but it is used in a familiar/attenuative way to lower the sense of distance. The
previous comparisons with Spanish does not necessarily mean that Wampis borrowed
these uses from Spanish, as it is very common for diminutives to have this attenuative
use (Payne 1997). Furthermore, the diminutive use in a familiar/attenuative so
widespread in Peruvian Spanish have been clearly in/uence by languages like Quechua,
where this use is very common. Notice that Jivaroan languages have been in contact
with Quechua too.
In addition, the diminutive is used to add tenderness or endearment:
473(4)ut͡ ʃi‘child’mama ‘mother’ut͡ ʃi-t͡ ʃi‘little child’mama-t͡ʃi‘dear mother’The Wampis diminutive is also used to add an a$ective meaning or to attenuate
a proposal (i.e. make it seem like it’s not a “big deal”, or not very dramatic or
extensive). The diminutive can also provide a sense of politeness to an expression. For
instance, the next expression is commonly used to invite a bowl of manioc beer, the
staple drink among the Wampis.

7.8. Compounds
A compound word is a word that is formed by two di$erent words. The criteria
for determining compound words can be semantic or formal (Payne 1997: 92).
Formally, in Wampis compound words, both elements retained a high tone and are
susceptible to the vowel elision processes seen in Chapter VI. However, when they
receive in/ection, the in/ection only attaches to the second element, showing that they
constitute a single unit. For instance, normally the accusative =na appears on all
elements of a noun phrase when a determiner is present:
(32) núna sɨ ́nt͡ʃin ʃuarán
nu=nasɨnt͡ʃi=naʃuara=naNON.VIS=ACCstrong=ACCperson=ACC‘to that strong person’
However, in a compound word, like hapa_iauaã ‘puma’ (hapa ‘deer’ + iauaã325‘dog’), in a similar morphosyntactic environment, the accusative attaches to the second
root of the compound (iawaã) only, not to each element as in (32). Thus, hapa_iauaã is
treated as a single word, as shown in the next example.
(33) núna hapá ɲawáan
̃
nu=nahapa_iauaã=naNON.VIS=ACCpuma=ACC‘to that puma’In addition, compare (33) with (34) below, where the word tura ‘and,’ is added.
In (34), hapa ‘deer’ and iawã ‘dog’ appear as distinct words and therefore each of them
receives the accusative =na. Notice that it is impossible for that phrase to have the
reading ‘and to the puma’.
(34) núna hapán túra ɲãwãán
nu=nahapa=naturaiawã=naNON.VIS=ACCdeer=ACCanddog=ACC‘to the deer and the dog’
Syntactically, compound words always show a [Modi""er-Head] structure,
whereas adjectives in noun phrases can come before or after their noun head (the latter
is the most frequent order). Place names uniformly show a [Modi""er-Head] structure,
though in many cases the roots are phonetically reduced:
(35) t͡ʃinkanás<t͡ʃinkana+ɨntsa
bamboo.sp+river‘River of bamboo’ (for the community named t͡ʃinkanás, Spanish <Chinganaza>)
326Semantically, a compound word’s meaning is more particular or even completely
di$erent (i.e. unpredictable) from the sum of its parts. The next examples illustrate this
point for Wampis.
(36) hapá ɲawáã

‘sad’
In Wampis, compounds can be created by the following combinations:
Noun+Noun (as in example (36) above), Adjective+Noun (as in (37)), and more rarely
Noun+Verb (as in (38)). There are also examples of the intensi""er ima+Noun:
(39) imʲá nápi
ima_napi
INTS_snake‘venomous snake sp.’3277.9. Particles
A particle is generally understood as an invariant element (i.e. it does not
receive in/ection) that is phonologically independent. In this dissertation, I will not
refer to particles as a di$erent word class on their own. Rather, I use the terms
Interjection, Ideophone and Grammatical Particle to refer to elements that can be seen
as having the properties of being phonologically independent and being invariant.
These three categories constitute di$erent classes in the present analysis. Very brie/y:
Interjections are words that constitute complete utterances by themselves (they are
described in §8.11). Ideophones are words that evoke an idea in sound and function
mostly adverbially in Wampis but can replace predicates (they are described in §8.12).
Grammatical particle is a more restricted term: a grammatical particle is an invariant
element that provides some grammatical information (e.g. aspect) to the clause. There
are only two grammatical particles in Wampis, has and hak (see §8.13).","[364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"
"Table 19.12. Non-canonical switch-reference markers in Wampis
StemSu#xSubordinate clause → Reference clauseimperfective or-maNon-subject→Subject-tatamanaSubject→Objectaktionsart/perfective
unmarked aspect837A subordinate verb that carries -ma nor -tatamana cannot receive person
marking. This suggests that a possible historical scenario from where these two switchreference markers developed was a process of nominalization. Speci""cally, *-ma seems
to have been an old nominalizer (this hypothesized morpheme seems to be a formative
in Set II nominalizer -mau ‘Non-subject nominalizer’ too); the ‘subject to object’ switch
reference -tatamana seems to be composed of a formative *tata, the hypothesized old
nominalizer *-ma and *na, which is likely related to the current accusative =na in
modern Wampis. A verb marked with non-canonical switch reference cannot take other
subordinators (which in the verb marked with canonical switch-reference occupy the
position that precedes the marking of person (cf. Table 19.3)). However, non-canonical
switch reference is compatible with the conditional -ka (§19.11) and concessive -ʃa
(§19.12) su#xes. Notably, these su#xes are historically related to the focus marker
=ka (§18.4) and the additive focus marker =ʃa (§18.5), which are usually hosted by
nouns and noun phrases.
19.10.1. Non-subject to subject -ma
The su#x -ma attaches to an aktionsart/perfective stem and indicates that a
non-subject participant (a P participant, an object of applicative or a Location) in the838subordinate clause becomes the subject (A/S participant) of the reference clause.
If -ma occurs on transitive verbs, the resulting the sense of the verb is similar to
a passive, but there is no true passive in Wampis. For instance, in (35) the subject
‘dream’ occurs overtly in the nominative case and is not demoted, whereas the object
(‘him’) does not occur as an overt noun phrase (3 person objects are not overtly marked
in the verb).

In (36), the object of the applicative (‘her’) becomes the subject of the

The use of -ma to mark a Location-to-Subject interclausal relation is rare but
entirely possible. In (37), the location within subordinate clause is co-referent with the
subject of the reference clause. Here the location is the ‘road’ to the town of Bagua, on
which a 1SG participant is traveling.","[877, 878, 879]"
"86020.3.1. Complementation using nominalization and subordination
There is no unique pattern of complementation for verbs in Wampis; that is,
what type of strategy is used depends on the matrix verb. Generally, it can be said that
nominalization is the favored strategy when the subject of the complement clause and
the subject of the matrix are co-referent. In turn, subordinating su#xes are used when
the subject of the complement clause and the subject of the matrix clause are di$erent.
Some verbs of perception like antu ‘hear’ select a complement clause that refers
to an event, in which case the non-subject nominalizer -mau is used. This is illustrated
in the next examples. The nominalized clause, functioning as an object of the verb,
receives the accusative =na.

In the above examples, the subject of the complement clause and the subject of
861the main clause are di$erent. Another strategy when the subject of the complement
verb is di$erent than the subject of the matrix verb involves a subordinate construction
that consists of the subordinator -ku ‘simultaneous’ plus a switch-reference person
marker (in this case, the di$erent subject marker -ni ̃).

In (20), the subordinated verb ‘arrive’ receives the ‘simultaneous action’
subordinator -ku, a person marker -mi and an di$erent subject marker -ni ̃. Rather than a
nominalized complement clause, what we have is a typical clause combining
construction in Wampis (cf. Chapter XIX).
Other verbs of perception such as uaina ‘see’ select a participant nominalization
with the subject nominalizer -u in their complement structure, as illustrated in (21).

[Sccoby munt͡suuma-u]=nauaina-ka-ma-hiScooby breastdrink+IPFV-NMLZ=ACC see-INTENS-REC.PT-1PL+DECL‘We saw that Scooby drank milk.’
Another verb of cognition such as nɨka ‘know’ typically takes a complement with
Set I action nominalizer -ta if the subject of the main and the dependent clause are the
same, as in (22). Note that the nominalized verb does not receive case marking because
862of the case-marking pattern of Wampis (if 2 A acts on a 3 P, P does not receives
accusative marking, as explained in §16.3).
(22) ámɨka jukúmat nɨkámɨ
amɨ=kaiukuma-tanɨka-a-mɨ2SG=FOCswim-NMLZknow-IPFV-2SG+DECL‘You know how to swim.’
With the same verb, nɨka ‘know’, when the complement clause involves a
di$erent subject, there is a “relativization” strategy. The dependent verb is nominalized
with the subject nominalizer -u from set II.

‘He also knew the person that come carrying a spear.’
A nominalized complement clause with Set I -ta ‘action nominalizer’ functions as
the object of the inchoative complement-taking verb ‘begin’. Notice that, in this case,
the nominalized verb receives accusative marking.

20.3.2. Desiderative constructions
We have seen some complementation uses of nominalizations in the previous
863examples. However, not all verbs use nominalizers for complement clauses. Modality
verbs such as wakɨru ‘want’ express their complement with an purpose construction with
the subordinator -tasa ‘purpose’ (25) (see §19.9.3 for a description of -tasa) or they use a
desiderative construction with -tah ‘desiderative’ (26) (see discussion below for a
description of the desiderative construction in Wampis). When subordinators are used,
the clauses they subordinate do not receive argument marking; i.e. they are not treated
as nominals, unlike nominalized complement clauses.
(25) wi ́i sɨ ́ɨ ti ́tasan wakɨ ́rahai
wisɨɨti-tasa-nuwakɨru-a-ha-i1SGthankssay+LOAF-PURP-1SG.SS want-IPFV-1SG-DECL‘I want to say “thanks”.’
The desiderative construction consists of the desiderative su#x -tah, which
attaches to an aktionsart verbal stem, plus the verb ‘say’.
(26) wi ́i sɨ ́ɨ titáh táhai
wisɨɨti-tahta-ha-i1SGthankssay+LOAF-DES say+IPFV-1SG-DECL‘I want to say “thanks”.’ (Lit: ‘I say, wanting to say thanks!’)
For di$erent subjects with ‘want’, speakers use a quotative construction with the
subordinator -sa, as shown in the next example.
(27) táti túsan wakɨruthɛi
ta-titu-sa-nuwakɨru-tu-ha-iarrive-JUSSsay-SUB-1SG.SS want-APPL-1SG-DECL‘I want you to come.’ (Lit.: ‘I want, saying: “may you come”.)86420.3.3. Quotative construction
Manipulative verbs in Wampis also typically coach their “complements” in
quotative constructions, as shown in (28).

The verb of perception ii ‘see’ usually occurs in quotative constructions with the
extended meaning of ‘think’ (i.e. the quotative construction with a perception verb is
used to express a cognitive process), as in the next example.

20.4. Other adverbial constructions involving nominalization
Nominalized constructions with -mau plus a locative marker can be used for
adverbial functions, typically temporal. Nominalized temporal constructions are
illustrated in the next examples, where they involve event nominalizations.","[900, 901, 902, 903, 904, 905]"

Second person singular and plural objects are marked in slot 2 only when a third
person subject acts upon the second person object. Second person objects do not
distinguish between plural and singular forms, but the structures are not ambiguous:• when the second person P argument is singular, the third person A argument is
marked on the morphological position of subject (slot 7) of the verb.• when the second person P argument is plural, the third person A argument is not
marked, and instead the verb agrees with the plural SAP participant in the
morphological positions of object (slot 3) and subject (slot 7). See the examples below
for an illustration of this pattern.
Table 13.9 lists the 2 object markers. The forms -rama and -tama are shared with
the forms for 1PL object and are taken by “rV” and “tV” verbs, respectively. The
formative -ma present in -rama and -tama may also surface by itself marking a 2 person
object. This indicates that there might be an old morpheme *rV ~ *tV as another
formative in the -rama/-tama forms (probably related to the source of the applicative/
1SG object forms?).219219. Notice also that the plural form of the second subject marker is -rumɨ clearly historically
decomposable into -ru (which, again, has the same form one of the forms used for the applicative600Table 13.9. Second person singular and plural objects indexes

makes the sentence un-ambiguous with respect to the number of the object. In the case
of 3>2SG (51), the verb agrees with the subject (with the su#x -ji). In the case of
3>2PL (52), the verb agrees with the object (with the su#x -rumɨ, which normally
marks the 2PL subject).

The connection between the functional domains of middle voice and re/exivity
is well attested across languages (Shibatani 1985; Kemmer 1993; Givón 1994).
Somewhat confusingly, the re/exive -ma is homophonous with the verbalizer
su#x -ma (§12.6.2), the durative -ma (§13.3.4) and the recent past -ma (§14.2.2.2).
Historically, it is uncertain at this point of study whether there is a connection between
these functions, or not. However, the identity of all of these su#xes is clearly distinct
synchronically. In the following example, we have the denominal verb ‘scratch’ derived
with the verbalizer -ma, followed by the re/exive and the recent past morphemes, all
occupying di$erent positions in the verb.

13.2.1.5. Reciprocal -nai
Similarly to the re/exive, the reciprocal -nai is a bound verbal morpheme in
Wampis. The reciprocal indicates that the participants of the predication occupy both
the role of agent and patient with respect to each other, i.e. they act equally upon each
other. Examples of derivations with the reciprocal are given in (14).

The next example is also interesting. The reciprocal attaches to the main verb

other.’

"13.2.2. Valence-increasing operators
13.2.2.1. Causatives
There are three morphological causatives in Wampis. Two of them are
577commonly found in texts. There is one more that is unproductive and only occurs
lexicalized in a few verbs. The pre""x V- and the su#x -mitika occur frequently in my
data, whereas -ka is the unproductive one.
Cross-linguistically, the connection between event integration and clause union
in the expression of direct causation is very common, as direct causation is expressed
with the most integrated morphosyntactic type (Haiman 1983; Givón 2002a; Shibatani
& Pardeshi 2002). In Wampis, the pre""x V- and the su#x -mitika mark direct causation
and the highest degree of control by the causer. When the causee shows some degree of
volition, the causee is construed as an instrument manipulated by the causer, and the
causative event does not necessarily imply success. In this kind of situation, Wampis
speakers usually employ a quotative construction, showing less degree of integration.
For instance, in (18) the causee (Sua) is sent to the forest in the context where the
causer (Puhupat) needed someone to gather some plants to prepare medicine for a cold.
In this case, we have indirect causation as Sua has some degree of independent control
and the success of the caused event is less certain. Syntactically this is re/ected in a less
integrated construction involving a quotative construction.

‘Puhupat ordered Suwa to go to the forest.’ (Lit.: ‘Puhupat sent Suwa to the forest, saying: “go!”.’)212
Morphological causation in Wampis does not include the semantics of
permission, unlike in some other languages. Permission is typically expressed also with
a quotative construction, usually involving the jussive or the imperative.

Causatives in Wampis can be applied to intransitive and transitive predicates. I
have very few examples of causatives applied to ditransitive verbs.
13.2.2.1.1. Causative VThe causative V- is the only pre""x in Wampis. V- can adopt all vowel qualities
present in the language (/i, ɨ, u, a/); however, the phonetic material that appears with
the verb root is synchronically unpredictable. Thus, the form of this causative pre""x
must be learnt in connection with the verb root and stored in the speakers’ memory.
Examples of this causative pre""x are shown in Table 13.4.","[617, 618, 619]"
"• Robust same and di$erent subject marking in subordinate clauses.
• Controller of switch-reference -ma ‘non-subject to subject’ (cf. §19.10.1)
Turning now to the discussion of the treatment of the most-patient like
argument (P), this is another area where Wampis, as other Jivaroan languages (Corbera
Mori 1994; Overall 2007; Gnerre 2010), exhibits a very unique pattern. The following
principles apply to the marking of objects in Wampis:• First and second person NP objects always receive the accusative marker =na.
• Third person NP objects receive the accusative marker =na only if the subject is 1sg,
3sg or 3pl person.",[755]
"662objects access the position that is usually reserved for the subject, which is position 7. I
call this position ‘Person’ precisely because even though it is the designated position of
subjects, there are some exceptions whereby the A argument is not indexed—but there
is always an indexation of an argument in this position. In an inverse domain,
hierarchical agreement only occurs in a scenario where third person acts on a plural
speech-act participant (3 → Plural.SAP):232 in this case, the plural SAP (the P argument)
is indexed in the morphological position 7, designated by what I have called ‘Person’
(cf. Table 12.5). By contrast, in all other situations the verb always indexes the
grammatical subject (the A argument) in the same ‘Person’ slot, including when there is
a 3 → Singular.SAP situation. A/S arguments are marked by the same su#xes. The
complications do not end in what argument has access to position 7, ‘Person’. Objects (P
arguments) are also marked in a complex pattern: 3 person objects are never marked,
but the marking of SAP arguments varies. A ""rst person acting on a second person (1 →
2) indexes both arguments with portmanteau su#xes in position 7, ‘Person’. These
portmanteau su#xes historically are transparently related to the ""rst and second person232. Except with the 1 plural object -karatu. With -karatu, the third person marker (A argument)
occurs in position 7, and -karatu in position 2, ‘Object’. In that case, there is no agreement with
P.","[702, 703]"

The locative relativization on a noun that functions as an object argument of the
main clause usually involves a topic-comment strategy in the matrix clause. The noun
phrase which contains the relative clause occurs initially, followed by a complete main
clause which makes a predication about the initial NP. In (13) the main clause verb is
hɨã-ma ‘build house’. Notice that in (13) there is no case marking on the fronted NP, but
there is an obligatory co-referential (or resumptive) pronoun with the accusative case
marker in the main clause (in (13), the resumptive pronoun is the non-visible anaphoric
nu).

20.2.2.2. Headless relative clauses
Headless relative clauses are those “which themselves refer to the noun that they
858modify” (Payne 1997: 328). Headless relative clauses constitute a very common
relativization strategy in Wampis. Headless relative clauses in Wampis take case
marking. It is possible to have a headless relativization of an oblique argument with the
Set II nominalizer -mau ‘Non-subject nominalizer’ (an example of an oblique
relativization, which is semantically a location, is given in (17)), but speakers tend to
favor the inclusion of an overt NP to disambiguate the reference of the subject
relativized verb. The following examples illustrate headless relative clauses in di$erent
argument positions as well as in nominal predicates.
Headless relative functioning as subject:

20.3. Complementation
A complement clause is understood in this work as a clause that functions as an
argument of some other (prototypically main) clause (Payne 1997; Noonan 2007). There
is no simple complement construction in Wampis. Functional Wampis equivalents to
what are complement clauses in other languages are realized by employing
morphosyntactically distinct strategies:
a) nominalization
b) subordination (with switch reference)292
c) desiderative constructions
d) quotative constructions
In what follows I provide some brief notes on complement clauses that employ
nominalizing and subordinating strategies in §20.3.1. Desiderative and quotative
constructions are described in §20.3.2 and §20.3.3, respectively.","[897, 898, 899, 900]"

copula clitic =iti reduces its ""rst vowel /i/ when it is preceded by a vowel /ɨ/ of the
stem. The relevant parts of the derivation would be:
(43) derivation for /nut͡ʃikɨti/
syllable: nu.t͡ʃi.kɨ.i.ti
sandhi1: mora reduction: nut͡ʃikɨti
217sandhi2: vowel harmony: blocked
output: [nút͡ʃikɨti]
However, there are similar examples where vowel harmony applies:
(44)
nuiŋkiti
̃́
nui ̃=kɨ=iti
NON.VIS=RESTR=COP.3+DECL‘There only is.’
In this case, the reverse order of morphophonological process must apply. This
behavior is not very well understood. It may be the case that nut͡ʃikɨti ‘that only is’ is an
idiosyncratic form, perhaps a consequence of the relative high frequency with which it
occurs in narratives. One important observation from (43), however, is that when mora
reduction occurs between the stem and the copula clitic, other vowel elision processes
are blocked.
5.5.2. Do while moving -ki(ni)
The associated motion su#x -ki(ni) ‘do while moving’ (§13.3.2.6) triggers
optional vowel harmony with a high central vowel /ɨ/ of a preceding syllable of a
verbal stem. In practice, this optional process of vowel harmony is infrequent, as there
are few verb stems that contain an ɨ and at the same time are able to receive the
associated motion su#x -ki(ni).","[256, 257, 258]"
"• Interestingly, in Wampis the marking of P depends on a hierarchy in which what
matters is “who acts upon whom”, and not what is the relationship of P to the verb.
The uncommon syntactic case marking pattern of Wampis parallels the
morphological patterns that are found in some Hierarchical agreement systems
(DeLancey 1981; Siewierska 2003; Zuñiga 2006; DeLancey Forthcoming). Interestingly,
Wampis also exhibits an uncommon type of Hierarchical agreement system that is
di$erent from case marking (cf. §14.3.3). Thus, the following hierarchy appears to
condition grammatical relations (and case-marking of P) in Wampis:
1PL/2 > 1SG > 37191pl/2 are always marked as P, but as A do not trigger case marking of 3P. 1sg is
also always marked as P, and as A always triggers case marking of P. 3 is sometimes
marked as P, and as A always triggers case marking of P.
There is one important coincidence between the hierarchical agreement system
(as analyzed in §14.3.3) and case marking in Wampis: in the verbal hierarchical
agreement, the same su#x -tama or -rama (see §13.2.4) is used for 1pl and 2sg, 2pl
persons, which are the grammatical persons that trigger the “no-case marking” of 3
person Object NPs. So it seems like 1pl and 2 persons are (or were at one point in the
past) construed as highly salient in discourse. Wampis seems to avoid marking
situations where the Agent is somehow construed as related to the 2 person (singular or
plural), i.e. the relationship between Speaker and the other Speech Act Participant
appears to be avoided somewhat. This relates to other parts of the grammar of Wampis:
for instance, we saw that the words for ‘mother’ and ‘father’ are never marked for
second person possession (cf. §10.4.1.4), and patterning together of 1sg and 2 also
occurs in other morphemes, such as the Plural Speech Act =ti ́ (§11.5.6).
16.4. Intransitive constructions
Intransitive constructions in Wampis have the valence requirement of one720argument, which is the grammatical subject. The intransitive constructions involve one
participant and a ""nal verb in a predication of an action, state or event. The single
argument of an intransitive construction (S) receives the nominative, which is zeromarked (§10.4.6.1). An oblique argument may be present, as in (22) but is not
obligatorily required by the construction. The overt NP may or may not occur in the
construction, but the subject is always obligatorily marked on the verb.

16.4.1. Existential construction
The existential is a lexical verb but because it is homophonous with the copula
verb a and exhibits some important distributional properties relatable to the copula, it721is analyzed in detail in Chapter XVII, which is dedicated to possessive, existential,
locational, attributive and equational constructions.
16.4.2. Weather constructions
As far as I can tell there is no avalent verbs in Wampis. Typical examples of
avalent verbs in other languages, such as meteorological verbs, are syntactically
intransitive verbs that codify an S argument:
(23) násɨampúawai […]nasɨ ampu-a-ua-i
wind blow-IPFV-3.SBJ-DECL
‘The wind is blowing…’(24) júmi ʃíir jutúkti
iumi ʃiiraiutu-ka-tirain veryrain-INTENS-JUSS‘That the rain rains hard!’
Most verbs which can be used to communicate a weather event or state occur in
intransitive constructions with a cogent subject. If a weather predication does not have
an overt cogent subject , the interpretation of the grammatical subject may be
problematic in some cases. For instance, if the verb umpu ‘blow’ in (23) occurs without
an overt subject in the predication, it is not possible to know what or who blows. In
those cases a weather event interpretation is problematic in Wampis.","[759, 760, 761, 762]"
"Table 13.7. Verb structure (simpli""ed)
-1012ROOTApplicative Object345678Person(Valence)As seen in Table 13.7, Objects are for the most-part marked in slot 2 of the
“derivational” morphological level. But there are some important caveats:• If the object is a 2 person, it is marked in position 7 of verbal piece, with portmanteau
morphemes that index both subject and object.
594• If a 3 person acts on a 2PL or 1PL object, then the grammatical person of the object is
marked in slot 2 of “derivational morphology” (with an object marker) and in slot 7
of “in/ectional morphology” (with a subject marker; i.e. the verb agrees with the
object).
The pattern of verbal argument indexation is explained in detail in §14.3.3, after
the subject a#xes are presented. For the present section, I will restrict myself to
presenting the su#xes that serve to mark objects.
Another interesting complication of Wampis verbal object morphology is that
1SG object markers and the applicative forms are identical, as noted earlier in §13.2.3.1.
The presence of the applicative also determines allomorphic the form of the object
markers for the ""rst person plural objects and second person object.
In addition, there are several su#xes used for the marking of singular and plural
Speech Act participants. As in other areas of Wampis morphology, the selection of
allomorphs of these di$erent object markers is entirely lexical and fairly untidy. Third
person objects are not marked on the verb.

instances). The actual pronunciation of -i ̃~-ɨ ̃ this form is quite variable, and most often
surfaces as an oral vowel. As the su#x always occurs at the end of the word, it is
di#cult to say whether it is underlyingly nasal or not (other nasal su#xes usually add a
nasal consonant when other morphemes are added). Given that some speakers still
pronounce it as a nasal, I assume that it was at least historically nasal, as some basic
comparative evidence would suggest: in the related language Awajun, where it is
apparently productive, the cognate su#x has the nasal form -ɨ ̃ (Corbera Mori 1994;
Overall 2007).
The following examples illustrate the use of u(a). In (23), the su#x -u(a)
attaches to the an imperfective stem. The same su#x occurs with the form -u in a future
context with he semi-copula ‘become’ in (24).

14.3.3. The typologically uncommon argument indexation pattern of Wampis
Wampis has two morphological positions where arguments are indexed: position
2, ‘Object’, and position 7 ‘Person’ (cf. ?). Position 2 is where objects are usually
indexed, and position 7 is where subjects are usually indexed. However, there are some
patterns pertaining to the indexation of arguments on the verb that make the Wampis
system a complex one. In transitive clauses, the Wampis system follows a typologically
uncommon pattern of hierarchical indexation. In the Wampis transitive indexation
pattern, in at least two cases, access to the morphological position of subject on the verb
is determined not by the grammatical role of the arguments, but by their relative
position on a person hierarchy. This is usually understood as a hierarchical agreement
system (Silverstein 1976; DeLancey 1981; Zuñiga 2006; DeLancey Forthcoming), but
the Wampis system is not a prototypical hierarchical agreement system: there is a split
between singular and plural speech-act participants (SAPs), and only plural SAPs231. The speaker is making reference to a Peruvian legislation commonly known as Ley de
Communidades Nativas (Law of Indigenous Communities), which was passed in the 70’s.","[699, 700, 701, 702]"

SS sequential clauses have a zero form subordinator, and the subordinate verb is
marked for person.
In (16), the verb ‘make’ is marked as a SS sequential clause. The verb occurs
with the high a$ectedness aktionsart su#x -á and it is marked with the 1PL person form
the set of subordinate person markers (in this case -ri (cf. Table 19.9)). Notice that the
reference clause contains a normative construction with a copula plus a nomizalition.
One of the predicative functions of the patient/location nominalizer -tai ̃ is to mark a
normative tense with the meaning of “what we usually do”. Even though the copula is
marked for 3 person, the normative is understood as 1PL, thus the SS person marking in
the subordinated verb ‘make’ is 1PL. The verb ‘""x’ in the context of the example assumes
820the meaning of ‘prepare’.

The next example comes from a text in which the speaker explains how to make
manioc beer. As can be observed, there is a string of sequential clauses, all marked as
1SG.SS. All dependent verbs are marked with an aktionsart su#x (in the example, the
intensive -ka and the attenuative -sa occur on the subordinated verbs) and their
interpretation is perfective. The dependent clauses are all subordinated to the clause
containing the ""nite verb ‘crush’, which appears at the end of the string.

from a text in which the speaker tells about the foundation of the Wampis town of
Puerto Galilea (one of the founders is the elder mentioned in the example, Alfonso

As presented in Table 19.9, DS sequential clauses are marked with -matai ̃ for 1sg
and 3 persons, and with person+-(n)i ̃ for 2 and 1PL persons. As the name indicates, DS
sequential clauses describe events in temporal sequence, in which the subject of the
event predicated by the dependent clause is di$erent from the subject of the reference
clause. Instances of DS sequential clauses can be observed in (19)–(20). In (19), the
di$erent subject is a 3 person (‘toucan’ in the subordinated clause, and ‘Ikam’ in the
reference clause), so the su#x -matai ̃ is used on the subordinate verb.

On the other hand, in (20), the di$erent subjects are 2SG person in the

ikámia
ikama=ia

In (10), the ablative /ia/ surfaces as [ja], since it is in intervocalic position.
However, in (11), it surfaces as [ia]. This occurs because, after vowel elision, the glide
is between a consonant and a vowel, which contradicts the Wampis principle that glides
are allowed word-initially and intervocalically. As a result, the palatal [j] reverts to [i].
This means that in Wampis there must be re-checking rules that ensure that rules of
well-formedness are not violated. The following ordered derivation illustrates the
interplay between vowel elision, glide formation and re-checking rules:

Glides exhibit the following properties:• Glides are consonant-like for the purpose of word-internal vowel elision. For instance,
in a word like ‘rest’ in (14) the glide is treated as a consonant: the third vowel from the
left (which is to be deleted) is the third underlying /a/ (if the glide counted as a vowel,
then the third vowel would be the second /a/ from the left):
(14) /aiamatana/→a.ja.ma.ta.na →[ajámat]‘rest (ACC)’• From the above point, it follows that glides are do not count as moras. Evidence of
this it that words that have only one mora on the surface lengthen their vowel to
comply with a two-mora restriction for words in Wampis—it will be seen in Chapter VI
that the prosodic word in Wampis requires two-moras. A word like /ui/ ‘1SG’ derives a
glide, then it must lengthen its vowel /i/: /ui/ → [wi ́i]. In addition, because glides are86. The second realization, [waji ́s], is the realization with the optional epenthetic [j] inserted.

The jussive involves the expression of positive commands, desires or permission
directed toward a third person addressee. The jussive is marked with the su#x -ti. The
jussive has probably arisen from the historical con/ation of the immediate future -ta
and the third person marker -ĩ, although there is no trace of nasalization in the jussive
(but recall that -i ̃ surfaces very often as an oral vowel (cf. §14.3.2)).

the source for the imperative). As stated before, the future always takes the aktionsart/
perfective stem, thus the use of an imperfective stem in this case, from a structural point
of view, seems unexpected.
14.4.3.5. Prohibitive -pa
The prohibitive -pa is used with negative commands. It addresses a 2 singular by
default. If a 2 plural person is addressed, then the plural form -rupa is used. The su#x rupa is historically composed of a plural formative *-ru and the prohibitive -pa.
Optionally, speakers can use the su#x -pa followed by the 2 plural subject su#x -rumɨ.
There is no di$erence between using -rupa or -pa-rumɨ. The next examples illustrate the
use of the prohibitive.

Since the prohibitive typically refers to actions or events that are not desired to
occur, it very frequently occurs following the apprehensive su#x, as can be appreciated
in the above examples.
14.4.4. Apprehensive -ai
The Wampis apprehensive modality is morphologically codi""ed via the use of
the su#x -ai. The apprehensive serves to express that a potential event is seen as highly
undesirable. Following Lichtenberk, it can be said that the Wampis apprehensive
involves a miscellany of epistemic and attitudinal semantics related to the coding of
“the speaker’s degree of certainty about the factual status of a proposition and with his
or her attitude concerning the desirability of the situation encoded in the clause” (1995:
293). The apprehensive in Wampis covers the domains equivalents to what is typically679codi""ed with lest-clauses (Dixon 2002) and évitatifs (François 2003) in other languages.
Unlike the morphemes seen in §14.4.3, the prohibitive occurs with all persons. With the
second person, it occurs with the prohibitive -pa as was seen in the previous section.
Third person does not distinguish between singular and plural. Table 14.10 shows a
paradigm of person marking with the apprehensive.","[714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720]"

17.4.3. The construction NP + NP-tinu: possession
When the attributive su#x -tinu attaches to the second NP, it indicates that it is
possessed by the ""rst NP.
(12) ut͡ʃi ́rtin
ut͡ʃi-ri ̃-tinu
child-1PL/2PL/3.POSS-ATTRIB
‘with child’ (i.e. a father)
In the possession construction with -tinu, a copula may optionally (but not
necessarily) occur. Notice that -tinu does not derive a verb: the noun derived by -tinu
never receives any type of verbal morphology and continues to be a noun. Thus, the
construction with -tinu is a non-verbal clause type. Examples (12) and (13) illustrate
non-verbal clauses where a -tinu-marked NP occurs.

‘Cuñado Andrés has a farm.’aha-ri ̃-tinu
farm-1PL/2PL/3.POSS-ATTRIB250248. In the Wampis folklore, human-like beings that inhabit the forests.
249. The term kuɲau is borrowed from Spanish <cuñado> (colloquialy pronounced [kuɲao] in
Peruvian Spanish). In Peruvian Spanish, <cuñado> is used in the sense of ‘brother-in-law’ but
colloquially is commonly used as ‘friend’.
250. This sentence was translated to Spanish as Cuñado Andrés es con su chacra ‘Andrés is with his735(14) óoka nuwɨ ́ntin
au=kanuɨ ̃-tinuDIST=FOCwoman\1PL/2PL.3.POSS-ATTRIB‘He is married.’
A common use of the attributive construction is to predicate people’s names, as
illustrated in the next example:
(15) ínt͡ʃis naártin
Int͡ʃisu naa-ri ̃-tinu
Int͡ʃisu name-1PL/2PL.3.POSS-ATTRIB
‘Her name [was] Inchis,’
As mentioned earlier, a copula can occur after -tinu:
(16) at͡ʃúrtiɲaithɛi
at͡ʃu-ru-tinu=aita-ha-i
aguaje-1SG.POSS-ATTRIB=COP-1SG.SBJ-DECL
'I have an aguaje (Mauritia 0exuosa) farm.'
17.4.4. Tense reference and juxtaposition
Juxtaposed structures can have a past or present temporal grounding, as shown
in previous examples. However, juxtaposition constructions are not attested as having a
future interpretation in Wampis. A copula marked for future needs to be added in order
to obtain a future tense interpretation (and therefore, in such case, the clause is notfarm’ by my Wampis teachers (this translation is more faithful to the Wampis original). After I
asked for clari""cation, my Wampis teachers opted to change the translation to tiene una chacra
‘has a farm’).","[774, 775, 776]"
