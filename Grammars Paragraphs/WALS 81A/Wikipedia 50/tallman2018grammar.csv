"5.2.3.7. Verb stratum 3 - Positions 2 and 7 (objects)I will use the term object to refer to P, T and R constituents (Chapter 7). As pointed out in
Section 4.1.1.3, T has the same distribution as P. R has the same distribution as P in so far
as it occurs in a neutrally aligned verb complex, and is not coded with the dative marker
=kí. Objects can occur in positions 2 and 7. A position 2 object is illustrated in (5.85b)
above. When the object occurs in position 2 it is in focus.
That objects can occur in position 7 is illustrated below. Position 7 is a zone where
the object and the subject can variably order. My impression is that the argument which is
most topical (most activated based on previous discourse context) is the one which is closer
to the verb. Thus, PAV order is conditioned where A is mentioned in the previous
discourse. This is illustrated with the text examples in (5.111). (5.111a) displays a APV
order. The proper noun adan is the A argument, and the P argument is wɨtí ‘fish hook’. The
following sentence displays and (5.111b) displays a PAV order.",[370]

‘Adam paddled the canoe SLOWLY.’ TXT 021:017-018The information-structural difference between APV and PAV where both
arguments are in position 7 suggested by the example above, requires future research. Note
that this variable ordering only exists in C-flexible constructions. Recall, that in C-rigid
constructions, the {A,S} subject obligatorily follows the verb complex. Consequently,
Chácobo does not allow VPA constituent order at all.
According to Córdoba et al. (2012) P arguments can occur after the verb complex.
I have not represented this in the template above. The reason is that in all of my text
examples where P appears to follow the verb complex, there is an intonation break and a
pause. Literate speakers of Chácobo such as Caco Moreno always insist that there should
be a comma where an object occurs after the verb complex.
328Objects do occasionally occur postverbally, but they are separated by an
intonational pause. In the following example the speaker had mentioned the object in a
previous discourse context seen in (5.112a). The object seems to be mentioned as an
afterthought in (5.112b) because the original mention of the object was 5 sentences away.(5.112) a.ka=tɨkɨ(n)=kɨ́makoyɨnɨpi=i=nago=AGAIN=DSsuripowdereat=CONCUR:S=EPEN‘She went again to eat the suri powder.’…

TXT 022:020-025I have not investigated the issue of post-verbal P arguments in elicitation contexts
in detail. It is possible that future research will reveal that such a constituent order does not
require an intonational break.","[371, 372]"
"As is typical of demonstrative noun-combinations cross-linguistically (Matthews
2007; Croft 2001), the criteria of headedness do not clearly point to one or the other element
being the head in the tóa hóni ‘that man’ construct. First, according to the criterion of
endocentricity, neither tóa ‘that’ nor hóni ‘man’ is the head or dependent. Either tóa ‘that’
can be dropped leaving hóni ‘man‘ by itself as a referential expression or hóni can be
110dropped leaving tóa as the sole referential expression. Subcategorization does not discern
between these cases, either; all demonstratives can combine with all noun roots. I will refer
to the relationship between tóa and hóni in examples such as (3.2) as one of co-dependence.
Because constructs vary in terms of how well the criteria of headedness converge, I will
assume that the syntactic relations between elements across constructs in Chácobo vary on
a scale from symmetrical (co-dependent) to asymmetrical (head-dependent) based on the
criteria.
Complexes will be named after the syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective) of
their head (see §3.3 for a definition and justification of syntactic categories). For instance,
I will refer to the combination of the noun honi ‘man’ with the adjective siri ‘old’ as a noun
complex. I will refer to the combination of the verb tsaya ‘see’ with its dependents as a
verb complex. This means that the entire sentence in (3.2) is a verb complex in this
grammar. While all verb complexes are sentences, not all sentences are verb complexes.
For instance non-verbal predicate constructions (see Chapter 4 for the distinction between
verbal and non-verbal predicate constructions) can be sentences without being verb
complexes.
In cases where the relation between the elements of a construct is not asymmetric,
I will refer to the the complex by the name of the open class lexical category in the complex
(a description of lexical classes is provided in Section 3.3 below). For instance, the
combination of tsaya ‘see’ and =kɨ ‘declarative, past’ in (3.1) will be referred to as part of
the verb complex, because tsaya ‘see’ is a member of an open class of lexical verb roots
111and =kɨ ‘declarative, past tense’ is not. In (3.2), the combination of toa ‘that’ and honi
‘man’ will be referred to as a noun complex. The reason for this is that honi ‘man’ is a
member of an open class of lexical noun roots while toa is not part of an open lexical class
of morphemes. The principle that a complex is named after the open class lexical root is a
rhetorical convention. The reader should not attach any theoretical or descriptive
significance to this terminological move. For instance, I could call toa honi ‘that man’ a
demonstrative (or determiner) complex and it would not affect the structural analysis of
noun/determiner/demonstrative complexes provided in this grammar3.2. MORPHOTACTIC VARIABLESThis section is concerned with how the syntagmatic organization of morphemes, constructs
and complexes are described in this grammar. By syntagmatic organization, I refer to the
order of elements in a sequence and to their relative contiguity. Contiguity refers to the
degree to which two or more elements must occur together or conversely the degree to
which to or more elements can be separated by other elements (Croft 2001).
The study of the syntagmatic organization of elements in a grammar can be divided
into morphotactics and syntax. The distinction between morphotactics and syntax is usually
described as follows. Morphotactics refers to the distribution and organization of
morphemes in a word. Syntax refers to the distribution and organization of words in a
sentence (e.g. Hockett 1956; Anderson 2015a). The distinction is motivated as long as one
112can discover general organizational principles that distinguish morphotactics from
syntax.10 Otherwise the distinction amounts to an orthographic convention and should have
no place in a descriptive grammar.
At the same time, it is commonly implied or more simply stated, that there is a
continuum between morphotactics and syntax (e.g. Meira 1999: 122; Fleck 2003: 227;
Valle 2017: 241). A similar claim that seems to express the same basic idea is that the
precise division between morphological combination (suffixes) and syntactic combination
(clitics, particles, words) is arbitrary (e.g. Epps 2008: 125), even if there are general
architectural differences between the structure of words and phrases.
In this grammar I assume that the question of whether a language has two systems
of syntagmatic organization (even if they overlap or display fuzziness at their boundaries)
is an empirical question that should be assessed for each language (Haspelmath 2011;
Tallman & Epps forthcoming). I, therefore, take it as the null hypothesis that any
architectural division between morphotactics and syntax in a language is arbitrary, unless
the distinction can be motivated empirically.
It is against this background that I define the terms morphotactics and syntax as
opposing ends of a continuum of bondedness rather than terms that identify different10 An example of such an organizational principle comes from Quechua. In Quechua, in syntax the language
has an subject-object-verb order. Inside the verbal word, the order it verb-object-subject, where the object
and subject are expressed by suffixes. Thus, the order of the expression of grammatical relations is reversed
(Weber 1980).","[153, 154, 155, 156]"

primary evidence for this constituent comes from comparing the cases where the V̄consttuent occurs in position 8 to constructions where the V̄-constituent occurs in position
3 (the fronted-VP construction).
343The {A,S} subject does not occur in the same ordering relation with respect to the
V̄-constituent across these constructions. When the V̄-constituent is in position 8, the
{A,S} subject can occur before (positions 2 or 7) or after (position 16) the V̄-constituent.
When the V̄-constituent occurs in position 3, the {A,S} subject is fixed in position 7 after
the V̄-constituent. The {A,S} subject does not occur in a fixed order with respect to the V̄constituent. On the other hand, the {P,T,R} object precedes the V̄-constituent across these
constructions where the V̄-constituent occurs in position 8 and position 3.
The Fronted-VP construction can be viewed as a type of displacement test
providing evidence for a VP-constituent consisting of the object and the V̄-constituent
(Culicover [2009: 84]; Osborne [2015:253] for additional sources). This is illustrated in

"DEMONSTRATIVEnɨbiáyóʂaDEIC1:ADVwoman‘The woman is here.’ELIC191In overtly-marked non-verbal predicate constructions, the SNV and the predicate
phrase is separated by a clause-type morpheme. The non-verbal predicate clause-type
morphemes are ʂo ‘declarative’, ki ‘declarative, future’, ní ‘interrogative’. The reportative
morpheme kiá ‘reportative’ occurs in the same syntactic position and is mutually exclusive
with the clause-type morphemes in non-verbal predicate constructions. It could, thus, also
be analyzed as a clause-type morpheme along side the declarative and interrogative
morphemes (see Section 4.2.5 for more details). In overtly-marked constructions the
predicate and the SNV can be variably ordered.
The default order for non-verbal predicate constructions marked with ʂo
‘declarative’, kiá seems to be predicate-SNV with SNV-predicate order as a possibility. Nonverbal predicate constructions marked with ki ‘declarative, future’ display an obligatory
predicate-SNV order. SNV-predicate order is ungrammatical with non-verbal predicate
constructions marked with ki ‘declarative, future’. Interrogative non-verbal predicate
constructions marked with ní display default SNV-predicate order; predicate-SNV order
seems to be the marked option with interrogative non-verbal predicate constructions.
while subject-predicate order seems to encode that the SNV is in focus. The precise
type of focus for the subject-predicate ordering requires future research (see Valle [2017]
for a discussion of the different types of focus in Kakataibo). Examples of subject-predicate

"5.2.3.4. Verb stratum 3 – Position 14 (clause-type/rank)Position 14 is the clause-type/rank morpheme slot, which is discussed in the context of
verbal predication and clause-types (Chapter 4 above). The clause-type/rank morpheme
plays an important role in terms of the structure and the function of the clause as a whole.
Morphemes in this position encode clause-rank (main, nominalized, same/different
subject), the clause-type (declarative, interrogative, imperative, hortative, reportative), and
tense, aspect, evidential, modal and associated motion distinctions. Cutting across these
distinctions, the clause-type/rank morphemes can be further subdivided into types
according to a number of other syntactic properties; (i) distributional freedom/rigidity of
the subject noun phrases in the clause; (ii) whether they allow the V̄-constituent to occur
fronted in position 3.
Constituent-flexible (C-flexible) clause-type/rank morphemes allow subjects
(S/A) to occur in more than one syntactic position (not simultaneously); positions 2, 7 and
16. Alternatively, constituent-rigid (C-rigid) clause-type/rank morphemes force the
subject to only occur in one posisition; position 16. Effectively, the C-rigid morphemes
force a OVA/VS word order, while the former allow free constituent ordering. All C313flexible clause-type/rank morphemes also allow the V̄-constituent to occur in position 8 or
“fronted” in position 3, while C-rigid clause-type/rank morphemes force the V̄-constituent
to remain in position 8.
Subordinate clauses are either C-flexible or C-rigid as well. However, subordinate
clauses differ from main clauses in not containing positions after position 14. Thus the
subject (S/A) can never occur in position 16 in a subordinate clause, because this position
does not exist for such clauses. All same-subject clauses and imperative clauses are Crigid, whereas all other types of subordinate clauses are C-flexible. C-flexible clauses vary
somewhat in how flexible their constituent order is. I will refer to clauses with C-rigid
clause-type/rank morphemes as C-rigid clauses, and I will refer to clauses with C-flexible
clause-type/rank morphemes as C-flexible clauses. Table 5.9 provides a list of a all of the
clause-type/rank morphemes in Chácobo classified according to their clause type, clause
rank, additional functional categories they might encode and whether they allow flexible
or rigid ordering of the S/A subject. Clause-type/rank morphemes that are not main clauses
do not encode a clause-type. No information, therefore, occurs for clause-type for nonmain clause morphemes.","[356, 357]"

"Before moving on to a discussion of part-of-speech classes in Chácobo a
clarification regarding the use of the terms as bondedness continuum, morphotactic
variable, syntactic relation is in order. First, in this grammar all constructs have
morphotactic variables, regardless of where they are on the bondedness continuum. For
instance, morphotactic variables that define phrases are those of contiguity and
boundedness. The values of these morphotactic variables are such that they make what I
call phrases less morphotactic than stems.
Section 3.1 of this section described syntactic relations in terms of degrees of headdependent (a)symmetry. A head-dependent relation is typically conceptualized as
quintessentially “syntactic” since it is usually conceptualized as involving the combination
of “words”. Linguists are divided concerning whether syntactic relations between “words”
126extend into relations between elements inside words (e.g. Anderson 1980 vs. Bauer 1990;
Haspelmath 1992 vs. Croft 2001: 267). In the terminology of this thesis, the issue of
whether syntactic relations extend into words is formulated as follows: given a construct
consisting of two or more elements what is the correlation between the position of this
construct on the bondedness continuum and the asymmetry versus symmetry in syntactic
relations that these elements exhibit with each other? In the descriptive framework of this
thesis, therefore, whether syntactic relations extend into the “word” is a matter of degree
that could in principle vary between languages because syntactic relations and bondedness
(wordhood) vary along continuous parameters in a language specific fashion.
Syntactic relations and morphotactic variables combine to divide Chácobo
grammar into a number of categories. The next section discusses part-of-speech classes
distinctions based on distributional properties and the types of elements they can form
syntactic relations with.","[169, 170]"

‘S/he did not go and did not go quickly.’
‘S/he went but did not go quickly’There are two points concerning this variable ordering that require discussion in
relation to the issue of fixed scopal ordering. The points concern the position of yáma in
the verb complex, and how this morpheme can variably order with a position 4 or position
5. The reason is that =yáma can occur outside of the V̄-constituent (this is not true of other
position 2 morphemes). In cases where it occurs after an associated motion morpheme or
=tapi, I analyze it as occupying a position outside of the second verb stratum rather than
occurring within the second verb stratum.
Recall, that when =yáma variably orders with morphemes of position 2 it produces
an obligatory difference in scope. However, when it variably orders with morphemes
outside of this complex no scope difference is produced. This can be seen from the fact
that each of the variably ordering =yáma in (5.77) and (5.78) does not produce a difference
in sense.
I conclude that the morphotactic property of fixed scopal ordering identifies a
constituent spanning positions 1 to 3 of the second verb stratum. Past position 3, where
variable ordering occurs, it does not condition an obligatory difference in sense.
297Another morphotactic property is based on coordinability. Syndetic same subject
coordination was already discussed in Section 5.1.1.4, where it was shown that syndetic
(same subject) coordination identified a constituent contiguous with the verb stem.
Chácobo also has an asyndetic coordinate construction that operates over a distinct span of
the verb complex compared with syndetic (same subject) coordination.
Asyndetic coordination seems to identify a constituent of the second verb stratum
spanning positions 1 through 3. This is illustrated in (5.79). These examples show that the
morpheme =yó cannot have scope over a coordinated verb complex. It only modifies the
verb stem it combines with.","[339, 340, 341]"
"7.1. ARGUMENT CONSTITUENT ORDERChapter 5 presented an overview of the syntagmatic distribution of elements in the clause.
The position of noun phrase dependents in the sentence are represented in Table 5.6. The
alignment of constituent order in the clause is split, displaying a nominative-accusative or
neutral alignment depending on the position in the clause.
There are three construction types that display an accusative alignment in
constituent order; (i)fronted-VP constructions (Section 5.2.3.6); (ii) auxiliary verbconstructions (Section 4.1.4); (iii) reportative C-flexible constructions (see 5.2.3.4 on the
522definition of C-flexible constructions; see Section 4.2.5 and Section 13.16 on reportative
constructions). I discuss these alignments by comparing intransitive and monotransitive
clauses in Section 7.1.1. With respect to alignments based on comparing monotransitive
and ditransitive constructions, P, T and R display neutral alignment with respect to
constituent order. The one exception to this is for constructions where R is marked with
the dative clitic =ki (indirect/direct ditransitive verbs). In such cases R patterns
distributionally with A in certain constructions. The constituent order alignment of
ditransitive constructions is discussed in Section 7.1.2.","[565, 566]"
"5.2.3.14. Verb stratum 3 – Position 18The last position in the sentence can be occupied by a number of different types of
categories that encode adverbial semantics, such as adverbials, nominalized/relativized
clauses, same subject clauses, different subject clauses and postpositional phrases. These
modifiers can occur in any order at the end of the sentence. When subordinate (non-main)
clauses occur in this position they combine with the epenthetic clitic =na. Put another way,
=na signals that some subordinate clause is a dependent to a clause to its left. The iterative
combination of deranked clauses in position 18 of the sentence is illustrated in () (5.130)

variably order with one another producing an obligatory scope difference. Thus, the
criterion of fixed scopal ordering spans at least from position 1 to 2. The telic-quantifier

"1.8.1 Production Experiments
Production experiments consist of stimuli meant to elicit specific structures or properties
in a target language. Production experiments were used in order to gather controlled data
to analyze the phonetic contrast between stress and tone categories in Chácobo (Tallman
& Elias-Ulloa 2017). I also used the MPI picture and video stimuli in order to elicit specific
structures of typological interest and enrich the documentary record generally (e.g.
Levinson et al. 1992; Bohnemeyer et al. 2001; Bowerman et al. 2004).",[67]

the clause-type/rank morpheme (and, therefore, after the V̄-constituent) in both of these
constructions. However, in naturalistic speech it always seems to be separated by a pause,
perhaps suggesting a type of right-dislocation (afterthought) construction (Givón
2001b:267). In elicitation contexts speakers vary concerning whether they accept objects
after the clause-type morpheme without an explicit pause. The discourse function of noun
phrase constituent order and its relationship to pause phenomena require future research.
The point here is that the fronted-VP construction suggests some constituency between the
object and the V̄-constituent.","[387, 388]"
"7.1.1 Intransitive vs. Monotransitive: A, S and P7.1.1.1. Fronted-VP constructions: {A,S} vs. {P}Recall from Section 5.2.3.5 that the subject can occur in positions 2,7 and 16 of the
sentence. In positions 2 or 7, the alignment based on constituent order is neutral {A,S,P}
since A and P can be variably ordered. However, in the fronted-VP construction, only the
A and S arguments can occur in position 7, and P appears in a fronted position before the
V̄-constituent (see Section 5.2.3.15.1 for discussion).
The following sentences from elicitation illustrate the position of the A and S
arguments in the fronted-VP construction. These arguments pattern together by occurring
between the V̄-constituent and the clause-type/rank morpheme; =kɨ ‘declarative, past,

arguments cannot intervene between the V̄-constituent and the clause-type/rank

encodes a syntactic difference between A and P, even though it makes no case marking is
made clear the following examples from elicitation. Each sentence only has one

identifies the referent before transforming and the P argument describes the referent after
his transformation.","[228, 229]"

"1.1.2 Orthographic word segmentation or spacingThe concept of a word (morphosyntactic or phonological) is not used in this grammar.
Instead, I describe the constituent structure in Chácobo motivated by constituency and
wordhood tests. Nothing insightful emerges out of referring to one of these constituents (or
“layers”) as the “word” (see Chapter 5 for details). In the presentation of examples I
represent all combination that include affixes and clitics as one “word” orthographically.
The only exception to this is where one or more of the verbal clitics are interrupted from
the head verb by their subject as in (1.8) (see Sections 5.2.3.6, 7.1.1.1 and 7.2.2.1 on the

based on the morphotactic property of fixed ordering. Only morphemes of positions 1
281through 4 display completely fixed order. The position 5 morpheme can variably order with
the causative clitic =má as shown in (5.57). The affixes of position 1, position 3 and
position 4 cannot be variably ordered with one another and cannot be interrupted by the
clitic =ma ‘causative’. There are no counterexamples in texts, and this distributional
restriction was robustly tested in elicitation. That the causative morpheme cannot be
variably ordered with position 3 nor position 4 morphemes. The morpheme -ɨ ‘intransitive’
is a position 3 suffix and the morpheme -mis ‘antipassive’ is a position 4 suffix . Unlike
the position 5 morpheme -bɨkí ‘comitative-cooperative’ neither of these can be freely
ordered with the morpheme =ma ‘causative’ as is illustrated by the unacceptability of
(5.60b) and (5.61b).","[324, 325]"
"5.2.1.4. Verb stratum 1 - ConstituencyThe cut-off point between verb stratum 1 and verb stratum 2 made in this thesis is arbitrary.
There are a number of other cut-off points that one could apply. The verb stem can be
divided into three constituents according to different morphosyntactic variables to be
discussed below.
The verb stem corresponds to the largest of these constituents spanning all of the
positions provided above. The first morphotactic property associated with the verb stem is
that it cannot be interrupted by a free form element (a verb stem is maximally contiguous
in the terminology of Chapter 3). For instance, the negation morpheme yáma cannot
interrupt any of the morphemes. This follows from the definition of a stem provided in
Chapter 3.

ii. Derivational class defining11-3i. Systematic deviations from biuniquenessThe span of positions of the verb stem can also be identified through a a type of
coordinability test. Chácobo can coordinate parts of the verb complex through same subject
constructions. A same subject construction is a syndetic coordination construction where
the conjunct is a same subject marker that also encodes the transitivity of the right-most
clause (see Haspelmath [2004] for a typological overview). The coordinated constituents
in such constructions corresponds exactly to the verb stem.
Elements that are not in positions 1 through 5 can be removed in this construction
and have scope over both of the verb constituents. This is illustrated with the causative
clitic =ma in (5.58). The clitic =ma can be omitted on the same subject clause as in (5.58b)279and still have scope over both of the coordinated verb complexes, having the same meaning
as if it were in both as in (5.58a).19(5.58)a.wákahóni{atʃ-a=ma}cowman{grab-TR=CAUS} =CONJ:A {tie-TR=CAUS}yoʂa= ́wa=kɨwoman=ERGTR=DEC:P=ʂó{nɨʂ-a=ma}‘The woman made the man grab and tie the cow.’19 The use of the strikethrough on =ma in (5.58b) and (5.59b) should not be interpreted as adherence to anellipsis based analysis of the relevant construction. I currently do not understand the semantics of these
constructions well enough to be able to tell whether such constructions should be regarded as constituent
coordination or ellipsis under coordination according to how these concepts are understood in certain formal
approaches (e.g. Beavers & Sag 2004). However, Regardless of whether (5.58b) is interpreted as ellipsis
under coordination (non-constituent coordination) or constituent coordination, the patterns are still used as a
diagnostic for constituency (layers) in this thesis. The reason is that a constituent (layer) is understood as any
contiguous string of categories that is consistently identified as a constituent by a constituency diagnostic,
regardless of whether it converges with other such diagnostics or supports a fixed repertoire of universal
constituent categories (see Croft 2001). The claim here is not that phenomena distinguished in the literature
as constituent coordination versus non-constituent coordination (ellipsis) are the same thing, but rather, that
they identify or can identify different language-specific constituents (layer), i.e. they are distinct typological
variables for constituency that may or may not converge in a given language.","[321, 322, 323]"

"5.2.2.1. Verb stratum 2 – Position 2Position 2 of verb stratum 2 is a zone that consists of three morphemes that can be variably
ordered. The variable ordering of these morphemes also induced a difference in sense or
scope. In a sequence of position 2 morphemes, the rightmost element has scope over the
element to its left. This means that position 2 can build “layered structures” (in the sense
of Rice [2011]). This is illustrated with examples from elicitation in (5.63), where =ma

minimally contrastive sentences where the negative =yáma and the time of day adverbial

"5.2.3.6. Verb stratum 3 – Positions 3, 8 and 10 (V̄-constituent and pleonastic
wa)C-flexible constructions allow the V̄-constituent to occur in positions 3 or 8. C-rigid
constructions only permit the V̄-constituent to occur in position 8. I will refer to cases
where the V̄-constituent occurs in position 3 as “fronted-VP constructions”. I refer to them
as fronted-VP constructions, and not fronted-V̄-constructions, because if they contain an
{P,T,R} object, this object must occur in position 2. In other words, the V̄-constituent and
the object front together (see Section 5.2.3.15). Recall from Section 5.2.3.2 that phrases or
clauses in position 2 tend to refer to information that is given in the discourse context. In
322conformity with this function fronted-VPs are primarily used in cases where the main verb
of the sentence refers back to an event denoted by a previously uttered verb phrase. The
thing denoted in this case can be a literal restatement of the event (as in “as stated above”)
or refer to an action that is repeated by the subject. Consider the narrative sequence in

leaves his wife (a Chácobo), after his in-laws mock him for the way he eats. (5.107a)

the position 5 clitic tsi. In (5.107b), the narrator describes Isha coming back to his wife
after a few days. In (5.107c), the narrator describes how Isha did not come back again. Here
the V̄-constituent is fronted to position 3, before the position 5 clitic tsi. The S subject Isha

of the morpheme wa when the V̄-constituent is transitive. This was already illustrated in
Section 4.1.2.2 with the example in (4.8). The example in (5.108) provides another
illustration of the discourse informational status of fronted-VP constructions, but with a
transitive clause. In (5.108b) the fronted-VP (in bold) repeats the event denoted by nɨmos
‘mix’ from the previous sentence in (5.108a), albeit aspectually modifying it through
reduplication. Notice that in this case, the verb is transitive and, therefore, wa is inserted in
position 11, directly after the subject aʃiná ‘Ashina (erg.)’ which occurs in position 8. The324morpheme wa is obligatory in transitive fronted-VP constructions and contributes no
semantic information.(5.108) a.hawɨ́hímirɨa-mɨ=kɨ́tsikiáaʃiná= ́3SG:GENbloodfill-MID =D{A,S}P5REPAshina=ERGhawɨ́híminɨmos=ní=kɨ3SG:GENblood/relativemix=REMP=DEC:Pwáha=kato

"301.10. TYPOLOGICAL OVERVIEWChácobo has relatively small segmental phonological inventory and a very restricted
syllabic structure. Complex codas are prohibited, and only sibilants are permitted in coda
positions. Stress is assigned to the first syllable of a stem by default and on the second
syllable of a stem if there is there is an underlying high tone in this position. Chácobo
makes a phonological contrast between syllables with high tone and syllables without tone.
The distinction is lexical in Chácobo and the language contains a number of tone-based
minimal pairs that demonstrate the phonological contrastiveness of tones down to the level
of the morpheme. Toneless syllables are assigned a low pitch. The acoustic correlates of
stress are intensity and pitch and the acoustic correlates. The dual function of pitch in the
stress and tone system resulted in the language being described as containing three tones,
but it can be demonstrated that it only contains one contrastive high tone.
The complexity in the tonal system does not stop there. Chácobo marks case
relations with high tones and various morphosyntactic domains are signaled by the
differential insertion or reduction of high tones. Tone sandhi in Chácobo is highly complex
and interacts with the alignment system.
Chácobo can be loosely characterized as agglutinating in the sense that in most
cases one coherent meaning corresponds can be associated with one form. Deviations from
biuniqueness present themselves in a number of places in the grammar. Prefixes interact
with transitivity markers such that the prefixes sometimes seem to have a transitivizing
31function and sometimes not. In certain syntactic contexts high tone case markers are
deleted through tone reduction rules leaving only their tone sandhi effects on other
morphemes as exponents of their realization. Chácobo contains “epenthetic” case
formatives on its pronouns which seem to have no function but to meet conditions of
phonological minimality.
Where a language is positioned on the analytic-(poly)synthetic continuum depends
on a notion of word and/or how the linguist cuts the division between “morphological” and
“syntactic” phenomena. I view much of the grammar of Chácobo as straddling the
boundary between morphology and syntax such that a global distinction between words
and phrases and morphology and syntax is perhaps unmotivated on language specific
grounds. Symptomatic of this type of profile, the grammar of Chácobo will be presented
as ubiquitously built out of clitics.
The Chácobo language contains a complex system of “graded tense” expressed
through morphemes that encode various degrees of temporal distance from a reference time
(up to 9 distinctions). Their behavior in discourse suggests that they straddle the boundary
between tense and aspect categories. Chácobo encodes aspectual categories through a
variety of constructions and morphemes, but most striking from a typological perspective
through word order. Result perfect readings are achieved through positioning the subject
after a clause-type/rank morpheme; a morpheme which is obligatory in verbal predicate
constructions.","[73, 74, 75]"
"‘When his grandmother said this to them’ [they said] “We haven’t eaten her
mother!’ “We haven’t eaten our grandfather.”’ TXT 028:011A and P occur in a fixed order after the clause-type/rank morpheme. Based on this,
one might say that Chácobo displays an accusative alignment for core NPs after the clausetype/rank morpheme, because it shows that there is a dedicated position for the {A,S}
subject. However, there is a no evidence that P and S actually occur in distinct syntactic
positions after the clause-type/rank morpheme. It is possible that in the future such
evidence might be uncovered, but for now, the alignment difference is only observable
when a reportative morpheme occurs.",[577]
"Overtly-marked constructions contain the clause-type morphemes ʂo
‘declarative’ or ní ‘interrogative’ which occur after the noun phrase or the
predicate construct. Those overtly-marked constructions that contain ʂo
‘declarative’, ní ‘interrogative’, and kiá ‘reportative’ allow SNV and the
predicate to variably order (predicate-S order appears to be the default). A
non-verbal predicate construction marked with ki ‘declarative, posterior’
only allows for the predicate-SNV order.e.",[232]

illustrative rather than systematic. Systematic phonetic studies are needed in order to
determine whether the differences one can observe with the tokens chosen in the previous
discussion are statistically significant.
A production study was conducted with 5 Chácobo (three men, two women)
speakers in order to investigate the acoustic correlates of stress and tone. Speakers were
asked to read 26 sentences three times with trisyllabic nouns in sentence medial position.
The reason trisyllabic nouns were chosen is because when a high tone falls on the final
syllable of such forms, stress and high tone do not overlap allowing us to measure stress
and tone. For instance, in the noun panabí [ˈpà.nà.βí] ‘asaí’ stress will fall on the first
syllable by default. The stress cannot fall on the high tone since it must fall within a twosyllable window at the left edge of the stem.","[141, 142]"
"32Chácobo displays a split ergative alignment. The first split is conditioned by
nominal type such that full noun phrases are ergative-absolutive and pronouns are
nominative-accusative. The alignment is neutralized when the subject {A,S} argument
appears after the aforementioned clause-type/rank morpheme. Another typologically
salient characteristic of Chácobo that is present in other Panoan is its participant agreement
system and its same/different subject marking. Chácobo marks certain adjuncts as
associated with an A or an S argument. The system extends to clause-combination where
subordinators encode whether their subject is coreferential or different from an A or an S
of a matrix clause. Like many languages of South America, tail-head linkage, whereby the
information from a preceding sentence is partially repeated in the following sentence, is
common in Chácobo discourse.","[75, 76]"
"639In Chácobo the T and R arguments are indistinguishable in terms of case marking
and constituent order as shown in (8.54a); either haʔɨ́wa ‘his mother’ is interpreted as the
T argument and bakɨ́ ‘child’ as the R argument or haʔɨ́wa ‘his mother’ is interpreted as the
R argument and bakɨ́ ‘child’ as the T argument.","[682, 683]"
"Neutral: No arguments are distinguished from one another; {T,P,R}Recall from Chapter 4 (Section 4.1.1.3) that I distinguished two types of ditransitive
verbs in Chácobo; direct/indirect and neutral. Direct/indirect verbs code R with the dative
clitic =ki and mark T the same as the P argument is in monotransitive clauses; ∅ in the case
of full NPs, and with an accusative case suffix in the case of pronouns. Neutral verbs are
521those that encode R and T identically with P with respect to case assignment. The basic
distinction made in Chapter 4 between direct/indirect and neutral verbs is based on case.
This chapter considers alignment across other coding properties such as constituent order.
The alignment of constituent order is discussed in Section 7.1. The alignment facts
of case marking are described in Section 7.2. An overiew of alignment facts based on
coding and behavioral properties is provided in Section 7.3.
Iggesen (2006, 2007), Iggesen & Valenzuela (2007) and Córdoba, Villar and
Valenzuela (2012) provide descriptions of alignment splits in case marking in Chácobo. A
number of their descriptive statements need to be revised or updated in light of the more
detailed description presented here. Section 7.4 provides a brief summary of such these
revisions.","[564, 565]"

permutable; can be variably ordered. For instance, all position 1 elements are also position
5 elements; they can occur on either side of the NP-constituent. An overview of the
Extended-NP is provided in Table 5.14.",[409]
"1.8.3 Targeted construction story boardsTargeted construction storyboards consist of pictorial representations of stories that
consultants are asked to describe in their own words. They are used to reduce the influence
of the metalanguage in the elicitation of specific constructions (cf. Burton and Matthewson
2015). Data from storyboards are intermediate in naturalness between elicitation data and
naturalistic speech. They allow the linguist to elicit specific constructions within a more
natural discourse context without relying on the chance occurrence in elicitation, or
problems in the interpretation of elicited data. I developed storyboards from those found in
the Totem Field Storyboards http://www.totemfieldstoryboards.org/stories/. I used and
modified existing story boards in order to investigate the semantics of tense, aspect, number
and modality.",[68]

"Based on a historical analysis of tonogenesis in Panoan, Neely (2017) has suggested
that Amahuaca has much more in common with the Bolivian subgroup, a position she states
is potentially supported by structural similarities in the verb complex between Chácobo
and Amahuaca. Based on my understanding of the Amahuaca literature (e.g. SparingChávez 1998; Clem 2018), I find this proposal very plausible, however, the issue clearly
requires more serious attention and awaits a more extensive documentation and description
of Amahuaca.
Affinities between Panoan and Takanan languages of northern Bolivia have been
noted in the literature. Key (1968) and Girard (1971) provided reconstructions of some
Proto-Pano-Takanan morphemes. Girard reconstructs (1971) 116 vocabulary items for
17Proto-Pano-Takanan. 29 of these are “basic vocabulary” from the 100 core vocabulary
items on the Leipzig-Jakarta word list, which consists of vocabulary items which are least
likely to be borrowed (Haspelmath and Tadmor 2009). This provides some evidence for a
distant genetic relationship between the two families, however, more research in the
reconstruction of Panoan and Takanan is needed in order to earnestly assess the hypothesis.
A summary of the literature on the Pano-Takana hypothesis is provided in Zariquiey and
Valenzuela (forthcoming).","[60, 61]"

‘limitative’ in the extended-NP. The NP-constituent and the numeral always precedes both

same text.","[577, 578]"
"7.3. OVERVIEW OF CODING AND BEHAVIORAL PROPERTIESThe sections above have been concerned with the alignment of coding properties; case and
constituent order. Table 7.2 and table 7.2 provide overviews of the alignment facts
according to the construction and the referential domain. Table 7.2 compares alignment
across arguments in intransitive, monotransitive and neutral ditransitive constructions.
Table 7.3 compares alignment across arguments in intransitive, monotransitive and
direct/indirect ditransitive constructions.
577As stated this chapter is concerned with coding properties; constituent order and
case marking. But alignment systems can also be distinguished according to behavioral
properties (Keenan 1976; Croft 2001; Witzlack-Makarevich 2010). Behavioral properties
are treated in other chapters since they involve interaction with other parts of the grammar.
The tables below also summarize alignment according to behavioral properties, corssreferencing other parts of the grammar where these topics are treated.","[620, 621]"
"4.1.1.3. Monotransitive versus DitransitivesAmong transitive verbal predicates we can distinguish between monotransitive and
ditransitive ones. A monotransitive verb only has one P argument. A ditransitive clause has
two objects or object-like arguments. Across languages, a prototypical ditransitive verb
denotes concepts in the semantic domain of transfer (‘give’), and it is based on this that the
two Ps can be distinguished on semantic grounds. Apart from an A argument, a ditransitive
verb combines with a recipient-like argument (R) and a theme argument (T) (Malchukov
2010; Haspelmath 2015; Guillaume 2008; Zariquiey 2012). Cross-linguistically,
constructions within languages vary in terms of whether R and T are coded distinctly or
175not. This distinction is relevant for Chácobo. Another way that ditransitives can vary crosslinguistically is whether they are lexical or derived through valency-adjusting operations.
The distinction between lexical ditransitive verbs and derived ditransitive verbs is similarly
relevant in Chácobo.","[218, 219]"
