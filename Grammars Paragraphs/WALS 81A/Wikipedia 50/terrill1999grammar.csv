Overview of clause structure, predicate
types and core participant marking
The aims of this chapter are twofold. The first part of this chapter describes and justifies
the theoretical premises on which the analysis of the syntactic structures of Lavukaleve
is founded, and outlines the grammatical terminology used in this thesis. In addition,
there is a discussion of which arguments are core arguments and how they are
expressed.
Secondly, the chapter provides a brief overview of clause structure, constituent order,
predicate types and core participant marking, in order to enable the reader to parse
sentences in the rest of the description without necessarily having read every word of
the grammar. As these parts of the chapter are intended as an overview, structures are
discussed briefly, with cross-references to detailed discussions of each construction type
elsewhere in the thesis.
9.1 BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE
Basic clauses in Lavukaleve consist maximally of a predicate, which is the head of the
clause, two core NPs (subject and object arguments of the predicate), and any number
of adjuncts, which may be various types of nominal adjuncts, adverbs or particles.
There are no verbs whose argument structure requires an adjunct, although there are
many verbs which commonly appear with adjuncts.
9.2 CONSTITUENT ORDER
The predicate is typically the final constituent of the clause (see below for a definition
2059 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREof predicates; prototypically, it means a verb, or anything that acts like a verb). Core
NPs precede the verb; if there are two, the subject must precede the object. There is thus
a fairly strict constituent order for basic Lavukaleve clauses: SOV (or, using DixonÕs
(1979) syntactic primitives, which are introduced below, SV/AOV).
Adjuncts may appear anywhere between these NPs and the predicate, although they
may not intervene between elements of the NP. A textual example of a near-maximal
clause:
1)[Aka]
aka
then[taragau
taragau
sea.eagle(m)[tail
tail
house(n)fi]

volori-¿
make -sgn[nikol]
nikol
firsthi].
hi
3sgnEFOCSo the sea eagle and the woman built a house first.gm 046In example (1) above, constituents are separated with square brackets. There are two
NPs; taragau na ne ruia la, the subject; and tail fi, the object (with a focus marker).
The predicate is lovolori hi (with a focus marker), and there are two adjuncts, both
particles, aka and nikol. Focus markers can occur at the end of any type of constituent;
they are a ubiquitous feature of Lavukaleve syntax, and it is almost impossible to quote
an example without at least one focus marker in it; indeed it would be misleading to try.
For a discussion of the morpho-pragmatics of focus marking in Lavukaleve, see Chapter
11.
Most clauses in Lavukaleve, however, consist of many fewer elements than this
maximal pattern implies; indeed there is no example in the corpus of a maximal clause
as outlined above. The only obligatory constituent of a clause is the predicate; all other
members are optional, and in particular, core NPs are often not present in clauses. Basic
clauses, then, typically consist of a predicate, preceded by some adjuncts, and possibly
one or more NPs. A textual example of a more typical type of clause structure:
2)[ Kini]
kini
ACT[ngoham]
ngo- ham
2sg- for[fo'sal]
fo'sal
fish(pl)[voakuru].
voa3plO1sgS-I'll go catch some fish for you.kuru
hit
gm 037In this example, there is an adjunct, kini, followed by another adjunct, ngoham,
followed by an object NP, fo'sal , followed by the predicate, voakuru.
It was stated above that there was a fairly strict constituent order SV/AOV. This is for
the most part true; if both subject and object NPs occur before the predicate, they must
occur in that order, and usually the predicate is the final element of the sentence.
However it is not unknown for one of the NPs, usually the subject NP, to appear after
the predicate. If this does happen, there is almost always an intonation break between
2069 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREthe predicate and the NP. Many such constructions seem to be repair constructions, in
which the speaker, having omitted to mention the NP subject overtly, then wonders
whether the hearer understood it properly, and adds it in as an afterthought.

after the predicate with no intonation break between the predicate and it. In Section
11.4.2 it is argued that these are not anomalies of constituent order, but rather are in fact
examples of demonstratives functioning as focus markers.
Adjuncts, too, can appear after the predicate, usually as an afterthought. Note the
intonation, indicated by the punctuation:

cp 037 - 038It was stated above that adjuncts can appear between any of the other constituents in a
clause. All syntactic and semantic types of adjuncts can and do occur in any of the
adjunct positions within a clause.
9.3 SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS AND GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
9.3.1 S YNTACTIC FUNCTIONSThe grammatical relations of Lavukaleve will be established using the universal
syntactic primitives A, S, and O of Dixon (1979, see also 1994), as defined rather more
narrowly by Andrews (1985).
For Andrews, the syntactic functions of A and O (Ôgrammatical functionsÕ in his
terminology) are defined in terms of the prototypical core arguments of prototypical
Primary Transitive Verbs; verbs which take two arguments, the semantic roles of which
are Agent and Patient (e.g. ÔkillÕ) (1985: 68). The syntactic function of A is Òan NP in a
transitive sentence receiving the treatment normally accorded to the Agent of P[rimary]2079 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURET[ransitive] V[erbs]; an O is an NP in a transitive sentence receiving the treatment
normally accorded to the Patient of a PTV.Ó (1985: 98). The syntactic function of S is
that of Ò[an] NP in an intransitive sentence that is receiving the treatment normally
accorded to the single argument of a one-argument predicateÓ (1985: 68).
9.3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONSThe syntactic functions of A, S and O are unproblematic in Lavukaleve; however for the
purposes of describing Lavukaleve morpho-syntax, rather than using A, S and O, it is
simpler and descriptively more revealing to use the grammatical relations of subject and
object. These grammatical relations are defined in terms of A, S and O. Subject is, again
using AndrewsÕ definition, Òthe grammatical relation, if there is one, that is associated
with A and S function; object the grammatical relation, if there is one, that is associated
with O functionÓ (1985: 103).
The following section justifies the theoretical and descriptive validity of the
grammatical relations of subject and object for Lavukaleve.
S UBJECTSIn almost every area of Lavukaleve, A and S pattern the same way in morphological
terms, and O patterns differently. Thus, on the basis of certain morphological tests, a
grammatical relation of Subject can be set up. None of Lavukaleve syntax is based on
constructions which require a pivot. Conjoined clauses of the sort Ôthe man hit the
woman and ran awayÕ (to use a time-honoured example) are expressed by clauses joined
in either subordinate-dependent or coordinate-dependent structures; in either case,
arguments tend not to be shared at the morpho-syntactic level, or at least, to not be
necessarily shared. That is, one could say Ôhim hitting the woman, the man went awayÕ;
Ôhim hitting the woman, she went awayÕ; Ôhim coming, he hit the womanÕ; Ôhim
coming, the woman hit himÕ and so on. In all cases, arguments are expressed by
pronominal affixes, except where this is precluded by combinatorial restrictions on
affixes. However, throughout most of its morphology, Lavukaleve is a
nominative/accusative language. The only area of exception is in adverbial subordinate
clauses, which show a split-ergative pattern, in which 1st and 2nd person subjects
follow a nominative/accusative marking system and 3rd person subjects follow an
ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.
Lavukaleve has no case marking for core argument roles, but its pronominal verb
prefixes are marked for grammatical relations. Compare the following:
5)Ali
ali
man(m)na
na
sgmArtokiu.
o3sgS-kiu
dieThe man died.","[230, 231, 232, 233, 234]"
"111 - I NTRODUCTIONlarge number of minor classes, including adjectives, demonstratives, pronouns, focus
markers, postpositions, conjunctions, the Habitual Auxiliary, locationals, demonstrative
identifiers and verb adjuncts. There is a definite article, unlike in almost all Papuan
languages. It is marked for gender and number, and is the final member of a noun
phrase. Many of the Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands have definite articles,
but they precede, rather than follow, their noun.
Nouns are divided into three genders. This is a feature common in languages of the East
Papuan Phylum, and rare in Oceanic languages. Gender in Lavukaleve is marked in
agreement forms on all noun modifiers, and on verbs through participant marking
prefixes and suffixes. Gender distinctions are maintained in singular and dual forms
throughout all areas of the language, but are collapsed in the plural. Nouns are overtly
marked for number, and the methods of marking number are highly complex and
irregular. There are up to 80 different ways of creating dual and plural forms of nouns.
Plural formation depends largely on phonological and semantic criteria, and also bears
some relationship to gender. Dual formation operates on different principles, largely
depending on the phonological shape of the singular noun. There is case marking for
three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load. Possession is marked
by a prefix on the possessed noun. Types of possession are undifferentiated, as in most
Papuan languages, as opposed to Oceanic languages, in which possession is frequently a
very complex area. In Oceanic languages, possessive affixes are frequently the same as
object affixes; in Lavukaleve, all but one are identical to subject affixes. Like in most
Papuan languages, but unlike in Oceanic languages, all modifiers follow their head
noun.
Deictics are a highly elaborated feature of Lavukaleve. There are personal pronouns for
1st and 2nd persons, but not for 3rd person. The functional domain of personal
pronouns in the 3rd person is filled instead by a demonstrative modifier, and two
demonstrative pronouns, all three of which are marked for gender, number and three
degrees of distance from the speaker, with a further distinction made in the distal
category between specific and non-specific location. The two demonstrative pronouns
differ solely in terms of their discourse pragmatics. One is used for a referent which is
uppermost in the minds of speaker and addressee. The other is used for a referent who
was referred to previously but who is not the last referent to have been mentioned. This
demonstrative is used to switch attention between more than one referent in a discourse.
The demonstrative modifier and this demonstrative pronoun, along with various other
spatial deictics, have derived presentative forms, and also derived predicative forms.
There is also a set of demonstrative identifiers which occur in a similar functional
domain to the deictic predicates.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex of Lavukaleve words. Person, gender,
number and syntactic role (subject and object) are marked by two prefix slots, and
suffixes mark tense, aspect, mood and derivational categories such as causative,
reciprocal, locativisation, nominalisation, intransitivisation, and intensity. There are also
121 - I NTRODUCTIONthree categories of subordination, as well as other categories including negation and
extendedness, which can be marked by verbal suffixes. Verbs can also take a suffix to
mark the gender and number of one participant. This gender/number marking is used to
mark the subject of stative/resultative intransitive verbs (as opposed to active
intransitive verbs which use a verbal subject prefix to cross-reference their subject), and
occurs also on the verbs of relative clauses and focus constructions.
Complex predicates are extremely common, and consist of verb-plus-auxiliary
structures, serial verb constructions, and, to a much lesser extent, verb-adjunct
combinations. Serial verb constructions are common in both Papuan and Oceanic
languages, and adjunct constructions are well known in Papuan languages. Lavukaleve
however does not make extensive use of either, preferring separate clauses for
combining predicates and other expressions in general for common collocations.
Like many Papuan languages, one of the methods Lavukaleve uses to combine
predicates is clause chaining. There are three verbal suffixes used in clause chains,
which indicate the temporal relationship of the chained clause to the following clause.
However, unusually for a language which has clause chaining, there is no switchreference marking, and indeed there are no restrictions on argument sharing between
chained clauses. Subordination is also a very frequent method of clause combining, and
there are a few different semantic types of subordinate clauses. While in almost all areas
of its morpho-syntax Lavukaleve is a nominative/accusative language, adverbial
subordinate clauses involve a split-ergative marking system in which first and second
person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system whereas
third person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system. Relative clauses are
internally-headed; their heads are syntactically part of the relative clause, not the main
clause.
Constituent order in Lavukaleve is fixed: SV/AOV. Departures from this norm are rare;
an argument which is an afterthought can be postposed. Preposing and postposing for
emphasis do not occur in Lavukaleve; these pragmatic functions are carried out instead
by focus constructions.
Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope
131 - I NTRODUCTIONof the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.
There is a deep relationship between deictics and focus markers involving, among other
things, a system of alliterative discord, a type of agreement system in which the form of
a deictic in a focus construction requires the form of the focus marker to disagree with it
in its initial consonant.
Focus marking and deictics are the most highly elaborated areas of Lavukaleve morphosyntax, and indeed the largest chapters of this description are devoted to these. In these
areas Lavukaleve finds grammatical expression of discourse-pragmatic domains of
focus, emphasis and activation. Indeed, as is clear from the description to follow, it is
not possible to explicate the basic morpho-syntax of Lavukaleve without making
constant reference to these pragmatic domains.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"27911 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS11.6 FURTHER DISCUSSION
11.6.1 NO MARKED FOCUSNot all Lavukaleve sentences have marked focus; in fact only about a third do. Under
LambrechtÕs analysis, all sentences convey information; they all have information
structure, and thus they all have focus. This is certainly true for Lavukaleve, as for all
languages. The above analysis has suggested that are two types of sentences in
Lavukaleve: those with grammatical focus constructions, and those without. By this,
however, it should not be understood that those sentences which do not employ a focus
construction do not have focus. Rather, in those sentences which do not employ focus
constructions, speakers are still conveying information about something; they are still
dividing their speech into presupposition and assertion; but they are not making this
distinction grammatically overt in the way a focus construction does. In other languages
with grammatically marked focus systems, for example Somali (Saeed 1984), the focus
system is likewise not used in every single sentence of the language.
If one thinks for a moment of focus constructions like LavukaleveÕs, or SomaliÕs, as
operating in a broadly similar functional domain as, for example, cleft constructions in
English (although LavukaleveÕs focus system and English clefts are very different types
of phenomena; see next section), then one can more easily understand why they are not
used for every sentence. In English, every sentence has information structure, but only
some have cleft constructions to make overt this information structure. In Lavukaleve, an
equivalent situation obtains, although the proportion of sentences with focus
constructions is far higher, corresponding to their considerably wider syntactic
possibilities, than clefts in English.
11.6.2 DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FOCUS MARKERS AND COPULASSentence-Internal focus constructions share many similarities with cleft constructions in
other languages. Functionally, they often serve to express the same kinds of pragmatic
meanings as cleft constructions with copulas do in languages that have them (see e.g.
Stenson (1981) on Irish). They serve to mark focus on a particular argument, and,
especially when the Sentence-Internal focus marker occurs in construction with a
constituent at the start of the sentence, one could interpret the Sentence-Internal focus
constituent as a copula clause, at the front of, and in construction with, the main clause.
However Lavukaleve focus markers cannot be analysed as copulas.
The focus marker is not obligatory in non-verbal predications. All the examples given
above could equally well appear without the focus marker. The distribution of focus
markers in non-verbal clauses is identical to their distribution in verbal clauses. In both
cases, it is pragmatic factors of focus marking which determine whether these words will
appear in a clause or not; whether the clause is verbal or non-verbal is irrelevant. Rather,
non-verbal clauses, like verbal clauses, may or may not be grammatically marked for
28011 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSfocus, and thus can appear with or without the focus marker, on those grounds alone.
There are two further major syntactic objections to treating the focus markers as copulas.
The first is that normally, the constituent which the focus marker is in construction with
does not move to the front of the sentence. Instead it stays in its place within the clause.
The focus marker appears immediately after it. Consider the following example:
81)Aira
la
aira
la

uvikola
umalau
o
uvikola

3plFOC 3sgS- plant -plhiv.
hiv
3plEFOC
e2 014bIt is possible to say umalau o uvikola fiv, aira la onorev hiv, but usually people
donÕt. They leave the focussed constituent in place in the clause. The fact that these
focussed constituents are not extracted makes a cleft analysis problematic.
There is a further problem with analysing Lavukaleve focus markers as copulas, even if
one does not argue that sentences like these are clefts. If one argues that the SentenceInternal focus marker is a copula, then one would be forced to say that in Lavukaleve it is
possible to intersperse a main clause with an embedded copula clause. That is, in the
above example (81), one would have to say that umalau o uvikola fiv is a copula
clause, embedded in the sentence aira la onorev hiv. These objections make very
unattractive the analysis that clauses with Sentence-Internal focus markers are copula
clauses.
11.6.3 FOCUS SYSTEM VERSUS ALIGNMENT SYSTEMIt is possible to be misled by the agreement patterns of the Agreement Suffix on the verb
and the focus marker into thinking that they form part of a syntactic alignment system.
Consider for example, that in positive clauses the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus
marker generally agree with O of a transitive clause and S of an intransitive clause; and
that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with A/S in negative clauses.
This phenomenon might suggest that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker are
actually forming part of a split-ergative agreement system determined on purely syntactic
principles. There are a number of reasons why this analysis would be unsatisfactory.
Firstly, not all positive clauses have the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker
agreeing with O; sometimes they agree with A. So one would have to find syntactic
reasons why in these cases agreement was with A, not O. One could argue that the splitergative system was based on partially syntactic and partially pragmatic principles; and
this kind of system does occur (rarely) in the languages of the world (see e.g. Dixon
1994: 211). But such an analysis would fail to account for the pragmatic function of the
focus marker in the sentences in which it occurs; and it would miss the generalisation that
the agreement of the focus marker (and verbal Agreement Suffix) can be predicted without28111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSexception by knowing which part of a sentence is being focussed on.9
11.6.4 A TYPOLOGICAL NOTELambrecht and Polinsky (1997) propose some typological universals with respect to the
grammatical encoding of sentence focus. They argue that there is a formal, paradigmatic
relationship between predicate focus and sentence focus constructions in languages:
Ò[sentence focus] constructions have the form they do because they are to be minimally
distinct from corresponding [predicate focus] constructions within a given languageÓ
(Lambrecht and Polinsky 1997: 191).
As a corollary of this, as sentence focus involves lack of a topic-comment structure, it is
important that the subject of a sentence focus construction must be marked in such a way
that it cannot be interpreted as a topic; thus, Ò[sentence focus] marking crucially involves
DETOPICALIZATION of the nominal constituents involvedÓ (p. 191). This detopicalisation can
be accomplished in one of two ways: either by cancelling formal properties typically
associated with topic arguments; or by coding the subject of a sentence focus construction
formally in a way typically associated with focus arguments. This leads to their Principle
of Subject-Object Neutralisation, which says that subjects of sentence focus constructions
are grammatically coded with properties typically associated with objects; and their
Principle of Topic Cancellation, which says that the subject of a sentence focus sentence
cannot be coded in a similar formal way to topics.
In English, sentence focus is marked formally by a prosodic accent on the subject NP.
This marking type, they say, comes about through paradigmatic opposition to predicate
focus marking in English, in which the prosodic accent is on the object: Òthe position of
the accent on the subject noun in the [sentence focus] construction is the result purely of a
formal requirement: the need to indicate a paradigmatic contrastÓ (p. 195). They present a
typology of formal marking of sentence focus, as opposed to predicate focus: sentence
focus marking in a given language may involve prosodic inversion, that is, giving the
sentence focus subject the prosodic accent usually associated with an object (or predicate);
changes to linear order; making the subject a single constituent within the predicate
(syntactic inversion); making the subject a non-topic; giving it non-nominative case
marking; or giving the verb impersonal agreement. Lavukaleve does not fit with any of
these formal marking strategies, but even though the material it uses to mark sentence
focus versus predicate focus is not covered in Lambrecht and PolinskyÕs typology, the
system it uses to mark the opposition between sentence focus and predicate focus is
exactly parallel to those used in many other languages.
That is, focus marker agreement in sentence focus and predicate focus constructions in
9Note that a split-ergative system does exist elsewhere in Lavukaleve. In subordinate adverbial clauses
first and second person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system, and third
person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.","[305, 306, 307, 308]"

Word classes
Word classes are recognised on the grounds of morphological possibilities and syntactic
distribution, combined with, in some cases, semantics. There are two large open word
classes in Lavukaleve: nouns and verbs. There are also a large number of medium-sized
to small closed classes. This chapter contains a justification of the classification of these
word classes. More details on each of them are found elsewhere in the thesis. However
some of the smaller classes which are not discussed elsewhere in the thesis are
described more fully in this chapter. Thus there is a description of the counting system,
and of some of the more commonly occurring particles.
The following word classes and subclasses must be recognised for Lavukaleve. They
will each be discussed in turn.

The class of nouns is an open class of words which share the following morphological
and syntactic features:
·
·
·
·they function as the heads of NPs
they have inherent gender
they can be modified by the demonstrative modifier
they can take the definite articleThere are three subclasses of nouns: common nouns (these include many of what are
traditionally termed proper names), locational nouns and place nouns. All of these have
the features outlined above. Locational nouns and place nouns differ from common
nouns in their ability to function as nominal adjuncts in a clause without appearing in a
postpositional phrase.
Locational nouns function as nominal adjuncts using the Locative suffix -n. Common
nouns are unable to take this suffix; instead, spatial relations involving common nouns
are expressed using postpositional phrases. There are only a small number of locational
nouns; it is a closed subclass of the open class of nouns. These include, for the most
part, nouns referring to places, positions, body parts and time.
423 - WORD C LASSESPlace nouns can function as nominal adjuncts with no morphological marking. All place
nouns are proper names, but not all proper names are place nouns; some are common
nouns, some are locational nouns.
Both locational nouns and place nouns can be modified by adjectives and
demonstratives, and they have inherent gender.
Nominal adjuncts, including those formed with common nouns in postpositional
phrases, with locational nouns using the Locative (and Perlative) suffixes, and with
place nouns are discussed in Chapter 7.
There are three genders in Lavukaleve: masculine, feminine and neuter, named for the
fact that in the masculine class belong (among other things) most nouns referring to
male people, in the feminine class belong (among other things) all nouns referring to
female people, and in the neuter class belong very few nouns referring to humans.
Nouns have a fixed gender, which controls agreement with its modifiers, and
throughout the clause. Note that there are a few nouns which are always plural. Because
plural nouns do not have gender, this means that, strictly speaking, there are some nouns
which do not have inherent gender. Such nouns are considered a special case of
common nouns; the phenomenon is more to do with morphological exigencies of
Lavukaleve than with the syntactic distribution of such words. The principles associated
with gender assignment are discussed in Chapter 6.
3.2 VERBS
Verbs have the following syntactic and morphological features:
·
·
·
·
·they function as argument-taking predicates
they can take subject prefixes, and object prefixes if transitive
they can take the Agreement Suffix to agree with their nominal arguments
they can take TAM suffixes
they can take the Nominaliser suffix -e ~ -i (they have to be nominalised in order to
function as head of an NP)
· they can take the Locativiser suffix -l
There are three subtypes of verbs, defined on the basis of their primary valency.
Intransitive verbs take only one argument (subject). Transitive verbs take two
arguments (subject and object). Ambitransitive verbs can take either one or two
arguments, with no overt valency-changing morpheme to mark the change of
transitivity (though the appearance of object affixation makes the transitivity clear).
There are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve (see Chapter 9.3.2 for argumentation for
this claim), and there are no verbs with zero valency. All verb stems are vowel-final.","[66, 67, 68, 69]"

which has one of its core arguments marked with the Agreement Suffix, with the
Agreement Suffix and the demonstrative agreeing with the same referent, and with no
intonation break between verb and demonstrative:

order is SV/AOV. However, a better analysis is possible.
Firstly, the only NPs which can appear in this position are demonstrative modifiers. No
other NP types can do this. Secondly, the verb of such clauses always involves the
Agreement Suffix. Thirdly, the demonstrative and Agreement Suffix always agree. These
points suggest that the demonstrative in such constructions is in fact functioning as a
focus marker, in a Sentence-Final focus construction. There is some deep overlap
between focus markers and deictics, as evidenced by the relationship between f- and hstems in both demonstratives and focus markers (see Section 11.7.1), and in these
constructions it seems that the demonstrative is functioning as a focus marker.
Note that in such examples, the hoia demonstrative modifier is used. It is not possible for
a demonstrative pronoun (that is, a demonstrative from the foia or oia paradigms) to
occur in this function. Further, hoia cannot have a head in such situations:
67)*Ami
ami
who(m)okiv
oki
-v
3sgS- shoot -plfo'sal
fo'sal
fish(pl)hoiva?
hoiva
MOD.MED.plWho shot these fish?e4 013bThe fact that hoia in these situations cannot take a head noun shows that it is indeed
acting in a manner very different from its normal syntactic function, and lends support to
the idea that it is functioning here as a focus marker rather than a demonstrative modifier.
11.5 MORE THAN ONE FOCUS MARKER IN ONE SENTENCE
It is very common in Lavukaleve for more than one focus marker to occur in one
sentence. There are two types of construction which need to be discussed in this respect.
27211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSFirstly, there are focus-echo constructions, in which there are two agreeing focus
markers, one focussing on an argument, and the other at the end of the sentence. The
second type, true multiple-focus sentences, contain more than one constituent in argument
focus.
11.5.1 FOCUS-ECHO CONSTRUCTIONSIn the focus-echo construction there are two agreeing focus markers. The second focus
marker must always agree with the first in gender and number, but not necessarily
person. The first is a Sentence-Internal focus marker, expressing focus on an NP
argument, and the second is a Sentence-Final focus marker. The verb appears with the
Agreement Suffix. The following pair of examples is repeated from above (45 and 46))
(in these two examples, italics only indicate the focus markers, not the domain of focus):
68)Aira

e3 021dThe first focus marker in each sentence expresses argument focus. To explain the second
focus marker in (68) one could say the second focus marker is agreeing with the object
NP, thus it is expressing predicate focus, and in (69) it is agreeing with the subject NP,
thus expressing sentence focus. There are major flaws with this line of argumentation
however.
Firstly, the shape of the second focus marker is entirely constrained. It must be from the
heo paradigm (see below, Section 11.7.1) and it must agree with the same entity that the
first focus marker agrees with. So, if the first focus marker agrees with the object NP, so
must the second focus marker; it cannot agree with the subject NP:

3sgfEFOCThat the agreement of the second focus marker is completely prescribed by the first focus
marker indicates that the second focus marker in these constructions has a different
function from the sentence-final focus markers of single-focus marker sentences. It
cannot distinguish between sentence or predicate focus, as the speaker cannot choose
which NP it should agree with.","[297, 298, 299]"
"262 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYMany words consist only of vowels. Lavukaleve allows long sequences of vowels. A
sentence example is ngai ui eua ÔI (f) eat foodÕ (1sg food(n) 3sgnO-eat-sgf).
A word can in principle consist of any number of syllables:
W->s*Monosyllabic roots are common. The longest root found is of six syllables:
manogirigiri Ôseagull sp.Õ. Most roots consist of two or three syllables. All verb roots
are vowel-final.
2.7 STRESS
Stress is realised as a slightly louder and lengthened syllable. Stress assignment is partly
fixed and partly lexically assigned. Most words have stress on their initial syllable. A
small proportion of words (something around 0.05% in the corpus) has stress on their
second syllable. Of these, many are old reduplications of the form C aVbCaVbX(X...);
that is, the word looks as if its first CV syllable has been reduplicated. Others are
obvious recent loan words which retain the stress pattern of the original word. For the
rest, there is no obvious formal reason for the non-initial stress. It appears simply to be a
property of these words. A very few words have stress on their third syllable. Those
phenomena relating to mono-morphemic words will be exemplified first. Stress patterns
in morphologically complex words will be described after this.
2.7.1 S TRESS IN MONO-MORPHEMIC WORDS· Most words have stress on the initial syllable. In particular almost all CVCV words
(including all CVCV nouns) are stressed on the initial syllable. For example:
'tata
'piruÔspiderÕ
ÔbowlineÕka'soÔnot knowÕbut note also:· Many two-syllable words of the form CVCVC have stress on the second syllable:
ni'kol
fa'luk
fo'salÔfirstÕ
ÔcabbageÕ
ÔfishÕThis is not always the case however:272 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGY'legis
'mikat
'hamusÔleafÕ
ÔcentipedeÕ
ÔnightÕ· Words of the shape CaVbCaVbX(X...), in which the first CV is identical to the second
CV, invariably receive stress on the second syllable:
tu'tuk
va'var
le'lengaÔtorsoÕ
ÔtalkÕ
ÔpuddingÕThese words are considered old reduplications because of their initial syllable; the
unreduplicated part is not synchronically analysable.
·Words of other syllable structures receive initial or second syllable stress. Some
examples:VCVVe'rau
'urioÔfallÕ
ÔcrabÕCVCVVVbu'taeo
'siriaeÔeagleÕ
ÔfishingÕCVVCVle'usa
'beataÔbetel nut slatsÕ
Ôleatherback turtleÕMost of the words with stress on the second syllable are nouns. There are also a couple
of particles and adjectives, and a handful of verbs.
·A few words have stress on their third syllable:
fela'koe
mala'gula
lau'rario
mita'keuÔvillageÕ
ÔbirdÕ
ÔpraiseÕ
ÔdogÕ· Recently borrowed words always receive stress in the place it would occur in the
source language (even if extra syllables have been added in order to make the word
conform with Lavukaleve phonotactics):
'kavis
ta'rak
'daevaÔcabbageÕ (from Pijin 'kavis)
ÔtruckÕ (from Pijin 'traki)
ÔgogglesÕ (from Pijin 'daeva)282 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGY·Secondary stress occurs every second syllable in either direction from the syllable
with primary stress:
'mano'giri'giri
'lovi'tan
'mita'keuÔseagull spÕ
Ôeel sp.Õ
ÔdogÕ2.7.2 S TRESS IN MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDSAll lexical roots have stress. Generally, affixes do not have their own stress. In certain
circumstances, however, the Possessive prefixes cause stress shifts on the words in
which they occur.
A lexical root with affixes (not including the Possessive prefixes) will retain its stress
even when prefixes occur on the verb:
'liki
o-'liki
o-ma-'likiÔwantÕ
Ô[someone] wants itÕ
Ôthey want itÕMonosyllabic roots receive stress when affixed:
'na
e-'naÔinÕ
Ôin itÕHowever when a noun or verb receives the Possessive prefix, stress shifts occur, under
certain very constrained circumstances.
S TRESS SHIFTS WITH POSSESSIVE PREFIX ON NOUNSSuffixes do not affect the position of stress on a noun, but the Possessive prefixes
(which are, incidentally, the only prefixes available to nouns) do. If the noun is not
monosyllabic, when it gets a Possessive prefix, stress remains in the place it would be if
the prefix were not there. But if the noun is monosyllabic and is prefixed, stress moves
to the prefix. So for example:
·stress position of nouns of more than one syllable is unaffected by prefixing:
'uia
vo'vou·ÔknifeÕ
ÔboyÕo-'uia
o-vo'vouÔhis knifeÕ
Ôhis boyÕstress position of monosyllabic nouns moves when noun is prefixed:292 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGY'ta
'nu
'kivÔtimeÕ
ÔhairÕ
Ôclothes (pl)Õ'o-ta
'o-nu
'o-kivÔits timeÕ
Ôhis hairÕ
Ôhis clothes (pl)ÕOccasionally this stress shift rule has been noted with nouns of more than one syllable:
'tuaÔwifeÕ'o-tuaÔhis wifeÕThis is very rare, however.
With nouns that undergo the loss of a final vowel under Possessive prefixing (see
below, Section 2.9), when this loss of the final vowel creates a monosyllabic noun, then
this stress shift rule applies to some words but not others:
'fina
'e-finÔbelongingsÕ
Ôour belongingsÕ'langi
o-'langÔnameÕ
Ôhis nameÕbut:If there were a fixed rule to cover these situations, it would be possible to say that the
two rules, loss of final vowel for prefixed nouns, and stress shift for prefixed
monosyllabic nouns, must be ordered with respect to each other. However the fact that
both patterns appear shows that the rules do not have a fixed ordering with respect to
each other. Rather, it seems each word has its own pattern.
S TRESS SHIFTS WITH POSSESSIVE PREFIX ON VERBSThere is a construction type in which the subject of certain verbs can be crossreferenced on those verbs by a Possessive prefix instead of the usual subject prefix (or
Agreement Suffix). This construction is discussed in Section 13.4 (see also Section
2.9.3 below for description of a morphophonemic rule involved in this construction).
What is of concern here is the fact that when verbs receive a Possessive prefix, the
stress of the verb moves from its place on the verb root to the Possessive prefix:
ÔI cameÕ, is usually a-'vo, but under the Possessor-subject construction it is:
1)'ngavoe
ngavo
1sgPOSS- come-e
-PSVI came302 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYSimilarly, Ôhe went upÕ is usually o'feu, but under the Possessor-subject construction it
is:
2)'ofei
o3sgPOSS-feu
go.up-i
-PSVhe went upThe stress on such prefixes is very marked. Occasionally stress does occur in the subject
prefix of regular verbs. Normally, Ôhe cameÕ is pronounced with stress on the verb root,
but occasionally one hears stress on the prefix instead:
3)'ovo
o3sgS-vo
comehe camePossessor-subject constructions seem to be a relatively new construction coming into
the language; they are used very commonly by younger people, especially children and
teenagers, and almost never by older people. It is possible that the stress pattern of this
new and popular construction is leaching into regularly-marked verbs. Formal factors
aid the transfer. Possessive prefixes are formally identical to subject prefixes apart from
the 1st singular form. So for most forms, only the form of the verb (not including the
subject prefix) and the stress pattern mark the fact that the construction is a Possessorsubject construction. The Possessor-subject construction is only available to a very
small number of verbs. It is no large step for speakers to start to use this stress pattern
on other verbs apart from just the verbs of Possessor-subject constructions.
2.7.3 HEARING STRESS VERSUS IDENTICAL-VOWEL SEQUENCESIt was said above that stress is realised as a longer and louder syllable. There are no
long vowels phonemically in Lavukaleve, but there are identical vowel sequences,
which are realised essentially as long vowels (see Section 2.5 above). Because of the
association between length and stress, and the partly unpredictable nature of stress, it is
sometimes a difficult matter in individual words to decide if a vowel sound is long
because it is stressed, or long because it is a sequence of two identical vowels. For some
words morphophonemic tests can be applied to distinguish between the two analyses.
Stress shift rules such as those described above can be utilised; if it is possible to put the
word in question into a construction in which a stress shift rule will apply, one can then
discern whether the syllable in question still sounds long (in which case it is an instance312 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYof an identical-vowel sequence) or not (in which case it is a stressed syllable)2.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"

emk 017NON-VERBAL CLAUSESNon-verbal clauses function in this respect similarly to verbal clauses. The focus marker
in non-verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions can in theory agree with either of the
two NPs that may be present, although in practice it is very difficult to find an example
showing the focus marker agreeing with one NP but not the other, because the
complement in almost all cases is the item of equation or identification with the subject,
and thus they both have the same agreement properties. Therefore, sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished in two-NP non-verbal clauses, but in practice often the
difference cannot be seen. There are some examples however which are clear:

construction and use a verb with a negative meaning in the focus marker clause (thus, not
using a non-verbal clause) (e.g. 40), or use a non-verbal clause with the negative particle
tamu ÔNEGÕ, but no focus marker (e.g. 41). The focus marker does not normally cooccur with the negative particle.

co2 044SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONThere is, then, a Sentence-Final focus construction in Lavukaleve which allows two
different focus structures. These focus structures are signalled by agreement of the focus
marker. It is not simply the case that the focus marker agrees with what it is focussing on,
but rather it works by signalling the extent of the focus through the sentence. The
appearance of the focus marker signals that focus is an issue in the sentence. The
agreement which the focus marker displays tells the hearer what the domain of the focus
is. Thus, Lavukaleve marks the distinction between these two types of focus
grammatically.
In predicate focus, agreement extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to
the object argument, which occurs before the verb. Basic constituent order in Lavukaleve
is S(O)V. In sentence focus, agreement extends throughout the entire sentence from the
focus marker at the end through to the first element of the sentence, the subject. Ellipsed
NPs do not matter for the scope of focus; the focus construction utilises obligatory verbal
and focus marker morphology to express scope, and it does not in fact matter whether or
not the actual NP arguments are there for the scope to obtain. It is not clear to what extent
adjuncts are included in Sentence-Final focus constructions.
Predicate focus is the most common, unmarked focus type in Lavukaleve. This is what
one would expect from LambrechtÕs definition. A focussed predicate is what would in
26411 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSother terms have been called the comment of a topic-comment structure: Òwhen the focus
is marked on the object ... this is a grammatical signal that the unmarked relation between
presupposition and assertion obtainsÓ (Lambrecht 1987: 374). In Lavukaleve, SentenceFinal focus constructions in which the focus marker agrees with the object are predicate
focus constructions. They are the unmarked Sentence-Final focus construction type; both
in pragmatic terms and in terms of distribution.
Sentence focus is a pragmatically (and distributionally) very highly marked focus
construction. In Lavukaleve it is used for situations involving very strong, often
contrastive focus. All negative Sentence-Final focus constructions take this form too.
Lambrecht points out that sentence-focus constructions are usually used for presentational
sentences involving all-new information. ÔPresentationalÕ, refers to structures that Òare
used to introduce an NP referent, or the concept associated with some NP, into the
universe of discourseÓ (1987: 375). Such sentences have also been referred to as thetic
(e.g. Lambrecht 1987. Note though, that Sasse (1987) expresses unease at such a
correlation of thetic utterances with sentences involving focus on the entire statement.)
For Lambrecht, Ò[Sentence focus] structures express propositions in which the assertion
extends over the entire proposition, they exhibit a certain Òall-newÓ character which
distinguishes them from [predicate focus] structuresÓ (1987: 379). This all-newness of
presentational, sentence focus structures also, in many languages, becomes associated
with situations involving unexpected or surprising information: ÒThe less the cognitive
status of the NP referent warrants the use of the [sentence focus] structure, the more the
construction will give rise to the implicature that the piece of information expressed in the
[sentence focus] structure is of special importanceÓ (1987: 379). These types of pragmatic
functions are indeed present in Lavukaleve sentence-focus constructions.
It is possible, and indeed common, in Lavukaleve to express focus on a particular
argument. In this case, the focus marker is still involved, but instead of a Sentence-Final
focus construction, a Sentence-Internal focus construction must be used. The next section
describes these.
11.3.3 SENTENCE-INTERNAL FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSIn Sentence-Internal focus constructions the focus marker is in construction with a nonpredicating constituent. That is, the focus marker follows it and, if applicable, agrees in
person/gender/number with it. The non-predicating constituents can be arguments or
adjuncts. I follow Lambrecht in using the term Ôargument focusÕ to label this focus type.
It will be shown below that the same construction type that serves to convey focus on an
argument or an adjunct can also be used to convey focus on a non-main verb or the first26511 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSpart of a complex predicate6 .
This argument focus construction type is similar to what is commonly referred to as
narrow focus, as opposed to the wide focus of the sentence focus and predicate focus
constructions discussed above.
If the focussed constituent is an NP, the focus marker agrees in person, gender and
number with it. If the focussed constituent is not an NP, the focus marker receives default
agreement, that is, it appears in its 3rd person singular neuter form.
It is easiest to see argument focus operating with NP arguments. The following examples
compare Sentence-Internal focus sentences with their non-focus marked counterparts. The
minimal/near-minimal pairs are elicited; they are useful to make the structures immediately
apparent. Textual examples will be discussed after this.
The first two examples are near-minimal pairs, the first has no grammatically marked
argument focus, the second has argument focus shown by the focus marker after the
object:

e3 010eThe next three examples show the difference between a focussed NP and a non-focussed
NP. Many of the examples to follow actually contain two focus markers in one sentence.
This is an extremely common construction type in Lavukaleve. This type of sentence, the
focus-echo construction, is discussed in more detail in Section 11.5.1 below. The second
focus marker must always be the heo focus marker, and it must always agree with the
first focus marker. At this point, only the first, italicised focus markers are relevant.
Example (44) is a basic Sentence-Final focus construction, showing predicate focus (see
above). (45) and (46) show argument focus; (45) (repeated from 13) has a focussed
object, (46) a focussed subject. The second shows focus on the fish, and the third on the
woman.","[289, 290, 291, 292]"

verbal prefixing, is the typical way of structuring reference tracking throughout a
narrative. Overt NPs are also used as last-minute additions, when the speaker suspects the
audience might not understand which referent was intended. Such afterthoughts usually
occur after a pause. The last NP of the following excerpt, otum na, is an example of an
afterthought NP (the pause is shown by slashes):

verb to have overt NPs for both its subject and its object. There is a strict word order rule
in Lavukaleve that if two NPs, subject and object, both occur in a clause, the subject NP
must precede the object NP. A transitive verb with two overt NPs does occur often in
elicitation, but in texts it is very rare indeed. This is probably because the discourse role
of NPs is mainly, as has been seen, to introduce or reintroduce participants. Speakers do
not usually introduce two participants in one clause. Therefore a subject and object NP do
not usually co-occur in one clause.
18.2.3 TRACKING REFERENTS WITH THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN OIA ÔTHE OTHERÕAnother method of tracking referents involves the use of the demonstrative pronoun oia
ÔotherÕ, which switches attention between two referents in a discourse (see discussion in
Section 8.7). Consider the following. The excerpt is about two participants: two boys,
and a group of people in a canoe. The two boys cut off the heads off some of the people
in the canoe, then go ashore. The remaining other people also go ashore. The
demonstrative pronoun oia (in its forms oinala (3rd dual masculine) and oiva (3rd
plural)) is used for overlapping reference to each participant:

My primary debt is to the many Lavukaleve speakers who made the effort to talk to me
and teach me their language. IÕm only sorry I was such a slow learner. It was the people
of the West Russells, and Mane Village in particular, who made this work possible, by
letting me live with them and making the effort to talk with me, even though I was clearly
a freak and possibly dangerous. Especially important were Chief Nicholas Sobo, his wife
Fane Navo, and two of their daughters, Marion Kuu and Nesta Kelavi. Fane Novo
overcame her shyness to be one of my few monolingual teachers. Marion and Nesta often
fed me, particularly in the beginning, and Marion kept me company for the first few
months when everyone else was too afraid to talk to me. My neighbours Emily Mavaua
and Colin Pawa also kept an eye on me, and the kids, especially Maureen and her gang of
little girls were brilliant teachers.
But my biggest helpers were Patterson Barua, and his wife Monica Felakoe Elufua, and
daughter Christa Kanefa. Patterson in particular taught me almost everything I know
about Lavukaleve, and everything I know about doing linguistics in the field. Monica fed
me and looked after me and made sure I was never in want of anything she could provide,
and Christa carried buckets of water. In a village with no water supply, this is no small
favour.
Also the people of Baesen, my other home, deserve my thanks, in particular the former
headmaster of Flahaba School, Stanley Sade, and also Chief Clement Savaka, Nancy,
Emily Fofokolin and Dora Iho and her husband, and their mother Salome Vavara, who
welcomed me into their homes when I first arrived in the Russells. Their warmth and
friendliness helped me through many a hard day. Also the people of Losiolen, Hae,
Louna, Alokan and particularly Karumulun who talked to me, especially Chief Raymond
Kolo, Julian Beglin, Janet Tokilo and Hilda Bungu. Also my other family in Yandina,
Ben Rabe and Hannah Kuatavea, and in Honiara, Anne Sade and her family. I am
particularly grateful to Hannah for looking after me whenever I was waiting in Yandina
for transport, which happened a lot, and to Ben for letting me make free with his canoe.
And of course, thank you to Michael Boliko, and also Addeson and Niko for driving me
round in BenÕs canoe any time I wanted, providing me with much interesting
entertainment on the way.
vAlso thank you to the people who told me the stories which provided the data for this
thesis. It is trite to say that without these people there would have been no thesis, but
nevertheless, each one of them made the effort to tell a story to the foreigner with the
machine, and this is gratefully acknowledged. Those who havenÕt already been mentioned
are: Abel Moran, Ann Onutu, Christian Hill, Clement Oiva, Edward Getu, Ethel Mary
Kanefa, Frank Koau, Georgina Makikifaria, Honiara Resman, James Nepolo, John
Hubert, John Nate, Kilaev Gulum, Matthew Ngele, Donald Ofiva, Melchior Pitu, Mase
Toto, Laurence Soitam, Sarah Kiko, Edwin Vefele, Wilson Ngara, William Fox, and
especially Mostin Nekuiga, whose willingness to tell stories about giants was exceeded
only by my willingness to record them.
Certain other people who were in Honiara at one time or another also receive my thanks,
including Evizel Seymour, Rachael Gooberman, and Matthew Bowden, variously for
either putting me up, or putting up with me, or both.
And back in Canberra, thanks to my friends, specially Catriona Hyslop, Bethwyn Evans,
Eva Lindstršm, Kazuko Obata, Tony Liddicoat, and Tim Curnow. During the last six
months, the PhD students at MPI Nijmegen entertained me and eased me into a new
culture, and they include Anna Margetts, Birgit Hellwig and Mandana Seyfeddinipur.
Back in Canberra again, thanks to my mother Pamela and my brother Simon, who both
visited me in the field, and made me see again with new eyes things that I had already
become used to. Thanks also to my mother for never-ending support of every possible
kind. Thanks to my brother Greg too, a prime example of how to never let a PhD get in
the way of having a good time. And huge thanks go to my best friend Michael Dunn, who
is always equally happy to read a chapter or give me a belay, and just as patient at both.
Making an appearance at the beginning of the project was Mark Donohue, who made a
major tactical error when he cut out pages 816-819 of the copy he gave me of Todd
(1975) in the hope that I wouldnÕt notice how interesting Lavukaleve looked. I noticed.
Evelyn Todd herself was a very important figure in the beginning, generously sharing her
Lavukaleve data with me before I had been to the Russells.
I would also like to thank my supervisors: in the Department of Linguistics, in the
Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, where I was based, was my main
supervisor Malcolm Ross, who can spot an Austronesian loan from 50 metres; as well as
Andy Pawley (all faults of style in this work are despite his best efforts); and Darrell
Tryon, who initially made me welcome in RSPAS. Sasha Aikhenvald from the Research
Centre for Linguistic Typology could always be relied on for boundless enthusiasm. Tim
Curnow again, also from the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology, made a stylish
last-minute appearance of inestimable value. In this paragraph also belong my thanks to
Nikolaus Himmelmann, who was never my supervisor, but who nevertheless did an
awful lot of supervising.
viThanks also to Gerrit Dimmendaal, David Wilkins and Bill McGregor for reading and
commenting on chapters. Also I would like to thank the Max Planck Institute for
Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, who provided a working environment
during the last six months of my PhD. I suspect I got a far better deal than they did from
my presence here.
There are also lots of people who are or were based in the Linguistics Department in the
Faculty of Arts at the ANU, who helped make me the kind of linguist I have become.
Whether or not theyÕd be happy with the result so far I donÕt know, but Bob Dixon,
Harold Koch, Ulrike Mosel and Anna Wierzbicka were the ones who initially gave me the
inspiration. Mind you, Ulrike said it would not be possible to write a grammar of this
language without speakers living in Canberra. Up until almost the last minute, I
completely agreed with her.viiviiiAbstract
The thesis is in five major parts. The first part, Preliminaries, deals with the basic
building blocks on which the grammar is founded; the introductory chapter, the
phonology and the word classes.
The second part of the thesis deals with arguments and adjuncts. Chapter 4 outlines Noun
Phrase structure and the structure of possessive constructions. Chapter 5 and 6 deal with
issues inherent to individual nouns; noun formation in Chapter 5 and gender and
agreement in Chapter 6. The morphological processes of noun formation are extremely
complex; for example there are at least 86 different ways of forming dual and plural
nouns. Chapter 7 discusses nominal adjuncts. Chapter 8 deals with the complex area of
deictics, one of the most structurally elaborated areas of the language. There are three
paradigms of demonstratives. One is a demonstrative modifier, and two are demonstrative
pronouns, which differ in their pragmatic reference; one is used to refer to an entity not
uppermost in the minds of the speaker and hearers, and the other is used elsewhere. The
relationship between the three demonstrative paradigms is complex and interesting, and is
dealt with in some detail. Presentative forms can be created from most of the deictics, as
can predicative deictics, by means of additional morphology.
The third part of the thesis concerns predicate structure. Basic clause structure and
principles of participant marking are outlined in Chapter 9. Constructions using the
Agreement Suffix are examined in Chapter 10. The Agreement Suffix, one of the
morphological means of marking participants, is a ubiquitous and important suffix in the
language. Focus constructions, discussed in Chapter 11, are another very elaborated area
of Lavukaleve morphosyntax. There are three paradigms of focus markers in Lavukaleve.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate, a sentence, an NP or an
adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles and non-main verbs. When
predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence. The agreement of the focus marker (with the person, gender and number of
either the subject or the object of the clause) shows the domain of focus. When arguments
and adjuncts are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,
ixsentence-internally.
Chapter 12 deals with the expression of tense, aspect and mood. Chapter 13 deals with
valency changing, the creation of predicates from words of other classes, as well as other
word class-changing morphological processes. The final chapter of this part, Chapter 14,
outlines the types of complex predicates existing in the language, including serial verb
constructions, verb compounds, verb-adjunct constructions, and predicates involving the
Habitual Auxiliary.
The fourth part of the thesis deals with interclausal syntax: clause chaining constructions
(Chapter 15) and subordinate clauses (Chapter 16). There are three types of subordinate
clauses; one of them, subordinate adverbial clauses, involves a split-ergative marking
system. Most other areas of the language have nominative/accusative alignment. The final
part of the thesis, discourse organisation, aims to bring together some of the broader areas
of importance to Lavukaleve discourse. The expression of questions and negation is
described in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18 is a discussion of typical Lavukaleve ways of
structuring discourse in narratives for textual cohesion, and an examination of how
reference tracking devices operate across a larger section of narrative than a single
sentence.
An appendix containing two glossed texts forms the final part of this thesis.xContents

Ôtwo (f) hundredÕ. The number for ÔtwoÕ takes feminine gender to agree with the gender
of tangalu. Three hundred and higher use the plural form of the noun, with a number:
tangalual enga Ôthree hundredsÕ.
The word for a thousand, lamukas, acts in a similar fashion. Two thousand is lamukas
lelagel Ôtwo (n) thousandÕ (with neuter gender to agree with lamukas). Three thousand
and higher use the plural form of ÔthousandÕ with a number: lamukasaol enga Ôthree
thousandsÕ.
Ten thousand is expressed by a phrase: lamukasaol vo-na kanongam literally
Ôthousands of-them tenÕ. A hundred thousand is formed on a similar pattern, but with
the order of words reversed: tangalual vo-na lamukasaol kanongam literally
Ôhundreds of-them thousands tenÕ.
One million is mola (n). Two million is mola lelagel Ôtwo (n) millionÕ. Three million is
mola enga. This noun, like many in Lavukaleve, does not have dual and plural
inflections.
LavukaleveÕs decimal counting system is possibly a loan from neighbouring Oceanic
languages; Lynch (1998: 144) notes that most Oceanic languages have decimal systems.
Laycock (1975: 224) observes that decimal systems are rare in mainland Papuan
languages:
Pure decimal systems characterise many Austronesian languages of Island Melanesia,
Polynesia, and Indonesia, but are rarely found within the New Guinea area itself...
Decimal systems do not appear to exist at all in the non-Austronesian languages of the
New Guinea area.","[77, 78]"

14.1.3 S HARING ARGUMENTS AND ADJUNCTSAll members of serial verb constructions share their subject arguments. If more than one
member is transitive, they also share their object arguments. Examples of all four
transitivity combinations (transitive-intransitive, intransitive-intransitive, intransitivetransitive and transitive-transitive) were shown above (examples (1), (2), (3) and (4)).
As has been evident from some of the above examples, subjects and objects differ in the
ways in which they are cross-referenced in serial verb constructions. A subject
argument can only be cross-referenced once per predicate (although it does not have to
be cross-referenced at all), on the last verb of the predicate, whereas an object argument
must be cross-referenced on every transitive verb of the predicate. This is because of the
principle of cross-referencing in Lavukaleve that every transitive verb must crossreference its object argument (see Section 9.7). However, even though each transitive
member of a serial verb construction must have its own object cross-reference, the
cross-referencing material all refers to the same argument. It is not the case that each
transitive verb of a serial verb construction chooses its own object argument, but rather
there is a morphological constraint that each transitive verb must be indexed for an
object argument. See below (Section 14.2 on verb compounds) where there is,
unproductively, a lifting of this constraint.
The fact that only transitive verbs receive object cross-referencing in a serial verb
construction shows that intransitive verbs do not share the object arguments of the
transitive verbs. Rather, only transitive verbs share their object arguments in a serial
verb construction, but all verbs share their subject arguments.
Unlike object cross-referencing, subject cross-referencing is not obligatory; and in some
constructions its presence may be proscribed. The examples of coordinate-dependent
constructions above illustrate this proscription. The next two examples show shared
subjects cross-referenced once, on the final verb of the predicate. The cross-referencing
may be of any kind allowed by simple predicates; that is either a prefix or the
Agreement Suffix.

v1 02114.1.4 S HARING MORPHOLOGYIt has been shown above that subject cross-referencing is shared among members of a
serial verb construction, while object cross-referencing is not shared, but must be
marked on each transitive verb of a serial verb construction. The Causative suffix
appears on an individual verb, and has scope only over that verb. This can be seen in
example (20) below. All other verbal morphology, including TAM, negation, and
subordinate adverbial clause-marking suffixes, is marked once only in the serial verb
construction, on the final verb, and has scope over the whole predicate. Examples of the
Non-Finite, Imperative and Completive suffixes only occurring on the last member of
the serial verb construction have occurred above (see (1), (3), (4), (6)). Examples of
other sorts of morphology follow:34314 - COMPLEX P REDICATESNegation:

cs2 032The different position of the Negative suffix in serial verb constructions with lei is a
morpho-lexical phenomenon, which does not have any implications about the scope of
negation. The Negative suffix, even though it appears on the first verb, has scope over
both verbs.
The scope of morphology in serial verb constructions is not negotiable: in all serial verb
constructions without lei ÔexistÕ, non-participant marking verbal morphology appears on
the final verb and obligatorily has scope over the whole serial verb construction. It is
only with serial verb constructions with lei as the second member that the Negative
suffix appears on the first not the last verb, and is not possible for the Negative suffix to
appear on the last, lei verb. Note that the Negative suffix is the only non-participant
verbal morphology found on serial verb constructions with lei in the corpus. It is not
known whether other non-participant verbal morphology would appear on the first or
last verb of serial verb constructions with lei.

Example (11) above shows a postpositional phrase between the two verbs of a serial
verb construction. Example (4) above shows the particle kini intervening between the
verbs of a serial verb construction. In the following example, the NP ngaui, referring to
the object of the second verb, directly precedes its verb and thus intervenes between the
two verbs of the serial verb construction:

involve one of the following motion verbs:
foa Ôgo downÕ
feu Ôgo up, go inlandÕ
ae Ôgo up, climbÕ
hau Ôgo ashoreÕ
vau Ôgo seawards, go outÕ
ve ÔgoÕ
vo ÔcomeÕ
Also occurring less commonly are other motion verbs sou ÔriseÕ, oio ÔsurroundÕ, fongo
ÔreachÕ, huru Ôgo insideÕ; aspectual verbs lei ÔexistÕ, lo ÔfinishÕ, and also lai ÔpaddleÕ, i
ÔdoÕ and sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ. These verbs provide directional, aspectual or
manner specification for the other verb in the serial verb construction.
The transitive verbs which take part in serial verb constructions are much more diverse
semantically, even though actual occurrence of transitive verbs in serial verb
constructions is far less frequent. Some of the more commonly occurring transitive
verbs include the following:34514 - COMPLEX P REDICATESma ÔtakeÕ
ke ÔdropÕ
li ÔbuildÕ
fei ÔscrapeÕ
fou ÔmakeÕ
lufu ÔleaveÕ
tuguri ÔchangeÕ
vala ÔpullÕ
sive ÔfollowÕ
ko ÔthrowÕ
The verbs which may occur in serial verb constructions are not restricted, and can be
any verb of the language.
With respect to the order of different verb types in serial verb constructions, a motion
verb usually, but not always, precedes the other verb; which may be another motion
verb, or may be a verb of a different semantic type. The verbs lei ÔexistÕ, lo ÔfinishÕ, i
ÔdoÕ and sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ are always the second verb of the serial verb
construction in which they occur. Note however the following example, in which lo
occurs both as the first and second verb of a serial verb construction:

verb constructions. DurieÕs (1997) account of serialising languages divides languages
into four types, under two parameters. The parameters are whether the verbs of the verb
sequence are contiguous, and whether they are incorporating: that is, whether the
components form a single morphological word. This account clarifies the relationship
between serial verb constructions and verb compounds. In Lavukaleve, serial verb
constructions are non-contiguous (see above, where it was shown that NPs and adjuncts
can intervene between verbs of a serial verb construction) and non-incorporating (the
verbs do not form a single phonological or morphological word). LavukaleveÕs verb
compounds (to be discussed below, Section 14.2) are, however, both contiguous and
incorporating; the verbs involved do form a single morphological and phonological
word.","[367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"

jn 139-141In the above example, sentence a. ends with verb ore Ôhe saidÕ. Sentence b. begins with
this same verb, this time in a subordinate Anterior clause, with subject laen mem na Ôthe
one in lineÕ. Sentence b. ends with ofoa Ôit went downÕ, which is the first verb of
sentence c., in Anterior form. These examples show that the repeated verb need not
necessarily be the first word of the following sentence, but rather it is the verb of the first
clause.
18.1.2 DISCOURSE-LINKAGE VERBSA second strategy for joining sentences is by means of discourse-linkage verbs. The term
(which I have taken from van Enk and de Vries 1997) refers to generic verbs which can
be used to recapitulate a previous event, in order to link it to the next event. In
Lavukaleve, verbs such as sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ (glossed ÔdoÕ), ngoa ÔstayÕ and
lo ÔfinishÕ are very frequently used for this purpose. The verb sia is used in this way in
the next example:
42618 - DISCOURSE ORGANISATION6) a.","[452, 453]"
"The function of enabling a demonstrative or locative deictic to be used as the sole word
of a single-word utterance holds for all words on which the Presentative suffix can
appear. Other functions of the Predicative suffix vary according to the word with which
it appears, and are described separately below.
4The term ÔPresentativeÕ is perhaps a bit unfortunate, as it is also used for, e.g. Ôpresentative
constructionsÕ, which is a rather different phenomenon. However, I continue to use the term, following
Fillmore, in order to avoid perhaps more confusion.
5Aka means, in various contexts, ÔsoÕ, ÔthenÕ, ÔandÕ, ÔthusÕ, ÔnextÕ and so on. However for the sake of
consistency it is invariably glossed as ÔthenÕ.",[215]
"2This term ÔactivationÕ is borrowed from discourse analysis and psycholinguistics, in order to describe
the semantic-pragmatic functions of the oia pronoun, especially with respect to how it differs from foia.
But in using the term, I do not necessarily subscribe to all the theoretical concerns of the area from which
the term is taken. I only use the concept with respect to reference tracking; the wider implications of
activation in the language are not dealt with here.",[195]

Word-level derivation: word class changing
and valency changing
Nominalisation is a common and productive process in Lavukaleve. There are two
different kinds of nominalisation: the very productive suffix -i ~ -e, which, added to verb
stems, derives an abstract noun; and the less productive -io, with a similar function.
Other word class changing phenomena are rare; there is a Locativiser suffix added to
verbs; adjectives can, rarely, be changed into verbs with the addition of the Causative
suffix; and there is a suffix that is attached to intransitive verbs to form adverbs.
There are a number of valency changing processes. The one valency increasing process is
the Causative construction, and there are three valency decreasing constructions: a
construction involving an Intransitiviser suffix -a; an Impersonal construction, and a
Reciprocal construction. There is in addition one construction which could be described
as valency rearranging, in which subjects of certain verbs are marked using prefixes from
the Possessive, not subject, prefix paradigm.
Note that as well as word-level derivation there is also phrasal-level word-class changing
in Lavukaleve. It was shown in Section 4.1.2 that the word mea ÔSPECifierÕ, normally
an adjective, has a non-adjectival use in which it can occur in construction with a particle
or a nominal adjunct to derive an NP or nominal modifier phrase. See the abovementioned chapter for discussion of this.
This chapter discusses in turn each of the word class changing and valency changing
constructions in Lavukaleve. The first section deals with nominalisations. The discussion
continues in the second section with other word class changing phenomena. The third
section deals with valency changing constructions. The final section discusses the valency

13.1 NOMINALISATION
13.1.1 THE NEUTER ABSTRACT NOMINALISER -E~-IThere are three methods by which verbs can be nominalised. Most common is the use of
the suffix -e~-i (glossed NOMZR). This is a very productive suffix, which can be added
to transitive or intransitive verbs.
This suffix is one of the few morphemes in Lavukaleve which is subject to a phonological
rule. Its form undergoes vowel harmony with the height of the previous vowel of the verb
to which it is suffixed:

-iNote that the rule of reduction of identical vowels at morpheme boundaries, which is a
general feature of the language (discussed in Section 2.9.3), comes into operation with
nominalised verbs which end in -e and -i. This rule means that in practice one cannot hear
the suffix when it is attached to a verb stem ending in /e/ or /i/. However, there is no zero
nominalisation in Lavukaleve, and all verbs ending in /a/, /u/ and /o/ must use this suffix in
order to become nouns; so it is no difficult matter to say that on verb stems ending in /e/
and /i/ the Nominaliser suffix is obligatorily used, then lost due to morphophonemic
processes. Some of the verbs in the table below illustrate this.
The Nominaliser suffix derives an abstract neuter noun from any transitive or intransitive
verb. Semantically, this is action/state nominalisation; that is, it is the kind of
nominalisation in which the derived noun expresses the name of the action or state
expressed by the verb (Comrie and Thompson 1985: 349).
For example, compare the following verbs with their corresponding derived nouns:
VERBDERIVED NOUNlo ÔfinishÕ
ve ÔgoÕ
honia ÔknowÕ
iru ÔsleepÕ (verb)
i ÔdoÕloe ÔendÕ
ve Ôgoing, wayÕ
honiae ÔknowledgeÕ
irui ÔsleepÕ (noun)
i ÔdeedÕThe fact that all nouns derived with this suffix are neuter is an example of morphological
gender assignment; but there is also a semantic association that many underived abstract
31813 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONnouns are of neuter gender. See Section 6.1 for a discussion of the principles of gender
assignment.
A verb suffixed with the Nominaliser suffix may carry with it any of the arguments and
adjuncts normally available to that verb, and carries cross-references for these arguments
with subject and/or object prefixes, as the principles of participant marking outlined in
Section 9.7 dictate.
Derived nouns have the following nominal features: they function as the heads of NPs,
and can thus appear with the definite article, they serve as arguments of verbs or
postpositions, and they may take the Locative suffix. The question of whether or not they
can take Possessive prefixes is a slightly complicated one, which requires some
discussion.
Nouns index possessors using a set of prefixes from the Possessive paradigm. This
nominal Possessive prefix paradigm is formally identical to the verbal subject prefix
paradigm except for one form. The 1st singular Possessive prefix is nga-, whereas the 1st
singular subject prefix is a-. Thus for most derived nouns appearing with a pronominal
prefix, one cannot tell whether the prefix is a Possessive or a subject prefix, as
theoretically it could be either. Some examples will make these points clear. Compare the
prefixes referring to 1st person singular with those referring to 3rd person plural:

3plPOSS- canoe
their canoe5)mavo
3plScome
their beginning6)mavau
3plSgo.out

-NOMZRSo derived nouns take subject prefixes, not Possessive prefixes. This leads to a further
point. The fact that a verb complete with subject and object prefix indexing can be
nominalised shows that the nominalising process happens after the verb has been indexed
31913 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONfor these arguments. That is, the bare verb stem is not nominalised; instead, the verb with
its arguments, which may be cross-referenced with prefixes, is nominalised. The
following examples illustrate this point:

To conclude, then, verbs may carry verbal morphology and arguments of their own, and
they may retain these when they are nominalised. However once they have been
nominalised they also have the noun-like properties of functioning as the heads of NPs,
appearing with the definite article, serving as arguments of verbs and postpositions, and
taking the Locative and Perlative suffixes. They do not, however, take Possessive
prefixes.
The following examples illustrate some of these features. The first example shows a
derived noun suffixed with the Locative suffix, which, together with me ÔSPECÕ
functions as an adjective modifying nei ÔcoconutÕ (see Section 4.1.2 for a discussion of
the function of mea ÔSPECifierÕ).

sentence; this sentence may be verbal or non-verbal.
Verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions take the form of a transitive or intransitive
clause, with whatever that entails, followed by a focus marker. The one specific
requirement is that the predicate (verb or Habitual Auxiliary) of a verbal Sentence-Final
focus construction must appear with the Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10), agreeing
with the focus marker. Rarely, a plural Agreement Suffix may be omitted. This is not
completely ungrammatical, but it is not considered good Lavukaleve (see Section 10.3.1).
For non-verbal Sentence-Final focus constructions, it is the same except that as there is no
verb or Habitual Auxiliary, there is no Agreement Suffix.
The role of the focus marker in Sentence-Final focus constructions is to mark the
construction as having focus. These construction types can involve one of two types of
focus; either focus on the predicate or focus on the whole sentence. It is the agreement of
the focus marker that indicates which kind of focus is intended.
25611 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSIt is easiest to see the difference between sentence focus and predicate focus in transitive
sentences, so transitive focus constructions will be discussed first.
Sentence-Final focus constructions in Lavukaleve in which the focus marker agrees with
the object NP (or complement of a non-verbal clause) involve predicate focus. The focus
domain extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to the object NP which
appears before the verb; for the purposes of focus marking this domain of verb plus
object is called a predicate here, following Lambrecht. (Recall that Lavukaleve has fixed
constituent order of S(O)V.) Predicate focus is the most usual, frequent, and
pragmatically unmarked type of grammatically marked focus.
For sentence focus, the focus marker agrees with the subject NP, the first core element of
a sentence. Thus the signal is that the focus extends from the focus marker at the end of
the sentence through to the beginning of the sentence. The focus domain is the sentence.
Sentence focus is much less frequent, and is pragmatically much more marked, than
predicate focus.
The subjects and objects of such sentences do not have to be expressed by full NPs; it is
the verb agreement which shows the scope of focus, and even if the overt NPs are
ellipsed, the verb agreement still tracks the scope intended.
PREDICATE FOCUS IN TRANSITIVE SENTENCESThe following examples show predicate focus sentences with the focus marker agreeing
with the object argument. In the first example, an older brother is jealous of his younger
brother, who has gone away and come back with a beautiful young wife. In this sentence,
he asks how the younger boy came to get this lovely wife:
17)(""Hey! Where did you get this woman from? "")
""Eta! Ngai f e

ke
EMPH
co 148The focus is not just on the woman, but rather on the whole act of taking the woman;
thus, it is on not just the object but the on verb as well as the object.
In the next example from the same story, the older brother has gone out and got his own
wife, after following his younger brotherÕs directions. However he followed the
directions rather poorly, and ended up with an old ugly wife instead, who he mistreats. In
this sentence, his mother is criticising him for mistreating his wife, saying in effect that he
only has himself to blame:25711 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS

The same situation obtains in the next example.
Later in the same story, the younger brother finds out his older brother tried to have sex
with his, the younger brotherÕs, wife while he was away. He wants to kill his older
brother, but his wife dissuades him, suggesting instead they go back to live with her
parents, and thus get away entirely from the elder brother. The younger brother wonÕt do
this; as he explains, it would be humiliating to take her back, after having stolen her in the
first place:

dream, to leave her husband and go and live with her relatives. She refuses, however,
saying her place is with her husband, no matter what he may do to her, and that whatever
he says, she must obey him. Note the object NP is this case is a relative clause, the head
of which is man Ôwhat (m)Õ, so the focus marker takes masculine agreement. There is no

allow other sorts of clauses to occur between elements of the clause chain. In particular,

VERB CONSTRUCTIONS AND SUBORDINATE CLAUSESClause chaining constructions were described in the previous sections as being a
particular construction type involving one or more coordinate-dependent clauses, each
containing a predicate marked with particular morphology, followed by an independent
predicate, which finishes the sentence. This clause chaining construction type is only
one of many ways in Lavukaleve in which to join verbs and clauses; it is worthwhile to
look briefly at each of the other ways in turn, to show that each one is structurally easily
distinguishable from clause chaining constructions.
INDEPENDENT COORDINATE CONSTRUCTIONSTwo or more independent clauses can be joined by the use of a conjunction. There is a
small number of conjunctions in Lavukaleve, including aka Ôthen, soÕ; hano Ôthen,
after, finishedÕ; leta ÔbutÕ; olang ÔbecauseÕ. These conjunctions are listed in Section
3.10. Of concern here is the structural differences between clauses joined using such
conjunctions, and clause chains. The major difference is that all the clauses joined using
conjunctions are independent; that is, they can freely stand on their own as complete
utterances. In addition, they can take the full range of TAM and participant marking
morphology normally available to independent predicates (and, for the most part, not
37715 - CLAUSE C HAININGavailable to coordinate-dependent predicates). For example note the conjunction aka
ÔthenÕ joining the two sentences in square brackets (each one a clause chaining
construction):

co 172Independent coordinate constructions are not common in Lavukaleve. It is certainly not
the preferred way of joining clauses. Instead, speakers prefer to join clauses using
clause chaining constructions or subordinate constructions.
S ERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONSClause chaining constructions are structurally very different to serial verb constructions.
Serial verb constructions are a type of predicate; clause chaining constructions are a
type of sentence. Clause chaining constructions consist of one or more coordinatedependent clauses, which are dependent on a following independent clause. Serial verb
constructions, however, do not have this relationship of dependence; each verb of a
serial verb construction is structurally equivalent to each of the other verbs in the
construction.
Serial verb constructions (discussed in Section 14.1) consist of a sequence of verbs
which occupy a single predicate slot. Like in clause chaining constructions, each of the
verbs must cross-reference its own object, but, unlike in clause chaining constructions,
the verbs do not take any morphology to show what relationship they have to each
other. A serial verb construction can mark subject arguments and TAM distinctions, but
only once across the whole predicate. Coordinate-dependent verbs cannot mark subject
arguments or TAM distinctions at all. Serial verb constructions can in fact act as a
coordinate-dependent predicate as part of a clause chaining construction, as the
37815 - CLAUSE C HAININGfollowing example shows (see also many previous examples in this chapter, including
(1), (22) and (25)):

Firstly, subordinate clauses are embedded within their main (independent) clauses, and
function either as an argument or a modification of their main clause. Subordinate
relative and purposive clauses bear little structural relationship to coordinate-dependent
clauses, and are not considered further here.
Subordinate adverbial clauses have predicates which are specifically marked with
special morphology which shows their semantic and syntactic relationship to the
independent clause, by using one of the Anterior suffix -ge; the Potential suffix -le or
the Surprise suffix -meon (see Section 16.1). They differ morphologically from
coordinate-dependent clauses in that coordinate-dependent clauses can never under any
circumstances cross-reference their subjects, whereas subordinate adverbial clauses can.
Subordinate adverbial clauses, if intransitive, have their own system of participant
marking, whereby third person subjects are cross-referenced as objects, in a splitergative marking system, and a special prefix e- holds the place of the normal subject
prefix.
Subordinate adverbial clauses can in fact be used to modify coordinate-dependent
clauses in clause chaining constructions. For example consider the following:
30)Ngoanun

[lit: He was staying lying down, as his body started to get strong, then standing up, ... ] hr1 014In this sentence fragment (the end of the sentence wasnÕt included because it is very
long, and not to the point) the subordinate clause otin elaketeige Ôupon his body37915 - CLAUSE C HAININGrecoveringÕ modifies the coordinate-dependent clause sou falere Ôstanding upÕ; it
describes what the anterior conditions for the completion of the sou falere clause were.
Note that the first and second coordinate-dependent predicates in this fragment, foa
fufure Ôlying downÕ and sou falere Ôstanding upÕ, are serial verb constructions.
15.5 CLAUSE CHAINING IN OTHER PAPUAN LANGUAGES
One might not expect necessarily to find structural similarities between Lavukaleve and
other Papuan languages; the term Papuan, after all, simply means that the language in
question is from a certain region of the world and is not Austronesian. Nevertheless,
constructions very similar to the one described in this chapter are very characteristic of
mainland Papuan languages, and it is worthwhile to look at how LavukaleveÕs clause
chaining constructions compare with clause chaining constructions in other languages.
Such constructions are not at all characteristic of the Oceanic languages surrounding
Lavukaleve.
LavukaleveÕs clause chaining constructions are similar in most respects to the wellknown examples in other Papuan languages, for instance Hua (Haiman 1980) and Tauya
(MacDonald 1990). Foley (1986) in his discussion of clause chaining constructions
mentions the following features as typical of such constructions in Papuan languages.
Typically coordinate-dependent verbs in Papuan languages have no tense marking
(Foley 1986: 196), and in fact their inflections are normally stripped down, often
including only a linking morpheme to show that they are in a clause chaining
construction (1986: 180). Typically, the temporal relation between the coordinatedependent and final independent verbs is marked; thus coordinate-dependent verbs
often mark whether their action is simultaneous with or sequential to the independent
(final) verb (1986: 180). Often Papuan languages with clause chaining constructions
have a switch-reference system, or some other tracking mechanism to show whether the
actor of a coordinate-dependent verb is the same as or different to the actors of other
verbs in the sequence. Final independent verbs are fully inflected verbs which contain
all information regarding TAM and person marking.
In Lavukaleve the situation is quite similar. Coordinate-dependent predicates carry
object marking if transitive, and carry a suffix to show their temporal relationship with
the next clause. Independent predicates in Lavukaleve carry full participant marking.
One place in which Lavukaleve differs from many Papuan languages is that in
Lavukaleve there is no obligation for the predicates of clause chains to share their
subjects, or to mark whether or not the subjects are shared, so there is no need for a
switch-reference system or some other mechanism to do this. In this respect,
Lavukaleve is similar to Yimas, which does not have a switch-reference system, and
does not require clause chains to have the same subjects (Foley 1991: 446). Also,
Lavukaleve does not have the simultaneous/sequential distinction which many
languages with clause chains make.
380CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Subordinate clauses
It was shown in Section 9.5 that there is a major division in clause types in Lavukaleve,
between independent (main) and dependent clauses. Dependent clauses themselves are
of two types: coordinate-dependent and subordinate-dependent. Coordinate-dependent
clauses are discussed in the previous chapter, Chapter 15. Subordinate-dependent
clauses, henceforth to be called simply subordinate clauses, are discussed in this
chapter.
Lavukaleve has three types of subordinate clauses: adverbial clauses, purposive clauses
and relative clauses. There are three different types of adverbial clauses, all marked by
verbal suffixation, and by changes in participant marking of the predicate, involving a
split-ergative system with 3rd person subjects following an ergative/absolutive marking
pattern and 1st and 2nd person subjects following a nominative/accusative marking
pattern. Purposive clauses too are marked by verbal suffixation, but do not have a splitergative marking system. Lavukaleve has internal relative clauses. That is, the argument
shared between the relative clause and the main clause is syntactically a part of the
relative clause, not the main clause. The following table summarises the basic morphosyntactic information to be covered in this chapter:

functional domains of complement clauses in other languages. For example the
complement of wanting is usually expressed as a nominalised clause (see Section 13.1
for a discussion of nominalisation). Example (49) below shows another common
construction in this functional domain: in He told them to go the verb of telling is
expressed as a subordinate Anterior clause, dependent on the verb go; thus, Him telling
them, they went. By such means as these the functional domain often expressed by
complement clauses in other languages is expressed in Lavukaleve.
The three major subordinate clause types, while they are all subordinate clauses, differ
markedly in their morpho-syntactic characteristics, and in the semantic functions which
they serve to express. This chapter, then, falls into three separate parts: a discussion of
adverbial clauses is followed by a description of purposive clauses then relative clauses.
16.1 ADVERBIAL CLAUSES
Adverbial clauses are subordinate clauses which add temporal, spatial, and other types
of meanings to the main clause. There are three kinds in Lavukaleve: Potential clauses,
Anterior clauses, and Surprise clauses. Adverbial clauses are marked by two means:
firstly, there is a suffix on the predicate of the subordinate clause. The suffix, as well as
showing that the predicate is subordinate, indicates the semantic relationship of the
adverbial clause to the main clause. Secondly, these clauses are marked by a very
special sort of participant marking. In this participant marking system, the surface
marking of grammatical relations within the subordinate clause is altered such that in
intransitive clauses the logical intransitive subject is cross-referenced using an object
prefix, and an invariant prefix e- holds the second prefix position, the position normally
reserved for cross-referencing to the subject of a transitive verb. This pattern only
applies to third-person subjects; first and second person subjects are marked as in main
clauses. It also only applies to intransitive predicates; transitive predicates use normal
main-clause participant marking strategies.
The system of participant marking in these clause types is described in the first sections;
firstly for verbs, then for the Habitual Auxiliary. This is a rather complicated area of the
language, and takes quite some explanation. The actual clause types, Anterior, Potential
and Surprise, are discussed only after this preliminary material has been dealt with. It is
necessary to explain the participant marking first in order for the reader to be able to
understand the examples of these adverbial clauses, which is the main descriptive task
of this section.
As with coordinate-dependent clauses, subordinate clauses are marked by verbal
morphology. This means that there are no non-verbal subordinate predicates.","[401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408]"

ja 211In all the previous examples, different subjects have been marked by overt NPs.
However if all protagonists are understood, subject reference can change with no
signaling of new actors. In the next example, paral nala Ôthe two larrikinsÕ is the
subject of the first, second, third and fourth coordinate-dependent verbs. In the fifth
coordinate-dependent clause ae lakokosorire Ôlifting the two (m) upÕ Ôthe whaleÕ is
understood to be the subject (from previous discourse); and in the independent clause
again Ôthe whaleÕ is understood as the subject. Thus, even though during this clause
chain the subjects are changed, there is no overt signaling of this. It is not obligatory to
mark a changed subject if the identity of the participant is clear from the discourse.

the last two coordinate-dependent verbs shows the hearer that the boys are now the
object, which might lead to a guess that the whale is now the subject.
It was said above that coordinate-dependent clauses precede the main clause, but there
are occasional examples where one of the coordinate-dependent clause in a chain
actually follows the main clause. The instances in which this happen are clearly
examples of afterthoughts; the coordinate-dependent clause is added after the rest of the
chain as a just-remembered addition, or in order to clarify a part of the event. In each of
the following examples, note the pauses (marked by slashes) after the main clause,

mn2 051-052No words, not even the focus marker, can intervene between the verb and me with the
Agreement Suffix. There are good reasons however why one would not want to say that
the me word is suffixed to the verb. The element is phonologically an independent
word; it can be said in isolation.
It is a different morphological word too. One observation in this regard relies on
parallelism with the prefixed forms of the Habitual Auxiliary. One would not want to
say that the me which is prefixed for its subject is different in its fundamental syntactic
nature from the me which receives the Agreement Suffix. All verbs are capable of
receiving either prefixes or the Agreement Suffix for participant marking, and the
Habitual Auxiliary, although it is not a verb, is no different in this respect. The me
which receives a prefix for subject is definitely a separate word from the verb which it
follows; and thus, the simplest analysis, without evidence to the contrary, is that the me
which receives the Agreement Suffix is too.
There is a further reason for saying that me with the Agreement Suffix is a separate
word from the verb, to do with participant marking. In these constructions, regardless of
the transitivity of the verb, the suffix on me agrees with the subject (S/A). If the verb is
transitive, it takes an object prefix. It is ungrammatical for an intransitive verb to take
the subject prefix and me to be unmarked; or for the transitive verb to take subject
marking and me to take object marking. If the verb and me were morphologically one
word, one would expect, judging from all other participant marking rules in the
language, that participant marking would be flexible in this respect; one would expect
subject or object to be marked at either end of the word, as it can be in any verb. The
fact that there is no flexibility here suggests that this is not one morphological word.
Rather, the rule is that the verb, if transitive, must mark its object. This is in fact a fixed
rule throughout the language; see Section 9.7 for discussion. For these reasons, me is
regarded as a separate word, both on the phonological and morphological levels, in
these (as indeed in all other) constructions.
The word me, suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re, plus the Agreement Suffix, is
used with negated verbs to express negative habitual-state meanings3. The resulting
construction differs from the construction discussed above only in that the auxiliary me
is always suffixed with the Future Tense marker -re in these constructions, and the3There are also four positive examples of this construction in a corpus of around 5000 sentences.","[381, 382]"
"25111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSand shows that the different constructions in which the focus markers occur, and the
agreement patterns which they display, correlate with different types of focus.
11.3 THE TWO TYPES OF FOCUS CONSTRUCTION
11.3.1 INTRODUCTIONThere are two syntactic construction types in which a focus marker can occur: SentenceFinal and Sentence-Internal focus constructions. Both construction types are a vehicle by
which a speaker can mark a particular proposition as being focussed in a particular way.
The discussion that follows has as its theoretical basis LambrechtÕs (1994) theory of
information structure (see also Lambrecht 1987, Lambrecht and Michaelis 1998 among
others), as a useful and revealing way to understand the forms and functions of those
constructions involving focus markers in Lavukaleve.
I employ LambrechtÕs definition of focus as a starting point towards understanding what
focus means in Lavukaleve, but exactly what pragmatic situations focus constructions are
used for should become clear through the data itself. Even without an a priori definition of
what focus is, it is clear that there is an overt focus marking system in Lavukaleve. The
particular pragmatic functions expressed by this system emerge from the analysis of the
various constructions involved. Saeed (1984: 19) makes a similar observation for Somali,
another language with a grammatical focus system.
LambrechtÕs idea of focus is a refinement of the traditional view of focus as new
information. Under his analysis, focus does not function to mark a constituent as new: for
one thing, it is not constituents alone that convey new information, but rather, the
conveying of information (old or new) comes about via the establishment of relations
between elements of the proposition (1994: 46-50). Indeed, focus functions Ònot to mark
a constituent as new but to signal a focus relation between an element of a proposition and
the proposition as a wholeÓ (p. 210). (Note that Òa focus relation is the pragmatic relation
between a denotatum and a propositionÓ (p. 210)). And further,
I do not define the focus of a sentence as Ôthe new informationÕ ... Rather I claim that
the focus is to be understood as a formal scope indicator, i.e. as a grammatical signal
indicating the scope of the assertion expressed by a sentence or proposition. The focus
indicates which portions of the sentence are asserted and which portions are
pragmatically presupposed. (1987: 374)Further, the focus of a sentence
is seen as the element of information whereby the presupposition and the assertion
DIFFER from each other. The focus is that portion of a proposition which cannot be
taken for granted at the time of speech. It is the UNPREDICTABLE or pragmatically NON-25211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
RECOVERABLE element in an utterance. The focus is what makes an utterance into anassertionÓ. (p. 207, his emphasis)2Focus occurs over a domain: Ò[t]he syntactic domain in a sentence which expresses the
focus component of the pragmatically structured propositionÓ (p. 214). This focus
domain is phrasal, not lexical, because it is the relationship between propositions, not the
mere appearance of lexical items, which serves to convey focus. Thus, focus domains are
always either predicates, arguments, or whole sentences.
Accordingly, there are for Lambrecht three types of focus: predicate focus, argument
focus and sentence focus. Predicate focus is Òthe unmarked subject - predicate (topiccomment) sentence type ... in which the predicate is the focus and in which the subject
(plus any other topical elements) is in the presuppositionÓ (p. 222). Argument focus is
where the Òfocus identifies the missing argument in a presupposed open propositionÓ (p.
222). (ÔArgumentÕ includes any non-predicating expression, including adjuncts.) This is
focus of the Ôidentification typeÕ of the traditional literature. Sentence focus is where Òthe
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-subject
elements)Ó. This is equivalent to the Ôevent-reportingÕ or Ôpresentational typeÕ of focus in
the literature (p. 222).
If one prefers a more semantic definition of focus which works well for the kinds of
pragmatic functions that focus constructions are used for in Lavukaleve, DikÕs (1989:
277) definition is useful. For Dik, focal information is Òthat information which is
relatively the most important or salient in the given communication setting, and considered
by [the speaker] to be most essential for [the addressee] to incorporate into his pragmatic
2LambrechtÕs ideas on focus are not uncontroversial. Dryer (1996) argues that LambrechtÕs definition of
focus is flawed because, among other things, the definition relies on a notion of pragmatic presupposition
which does not distinguish between two possible types of pragmatic presupposition: that involving shared
beliefs between speaker and hearer, and that involving shared mental representations by speaker and hearer.
Dryer argues convincingly that these must be distinguished. Also, LambrechtÕs definition says that the
presupposition part of a proposition is non-focal. DryerÕs main intention is to show that, contrary to wide
belief, non-focus is not the same thing as presupposition.
In a later paper, Lambrecht and Michaelis (1998) distinguish between three types of pragmatic
presupposition: knowledge presupposition, consciousness presupposition and topicality presupposition,
which Òcorrespond to different kinds of assumptions a speaker may have concerning the addresseeÕs state of
mind at the time of an utteranceÓ (1998: 494). Nevertheless the definition of focus used in this later paper
retains the ambiguity discussed by Dryer. However a minor adjustment to LambrechtÕs definition,
replacing ÔpresuppositionÕ with ÔactivationÕ, would, I think, solve DryerÕs problem with the definition.
In any case, for the purposes of the current discussion, it does not actually matter that LambrechtÕs
definition of focus is theoretically flawed in this respect. My central argument is that Lavukaleve has
overt morpho-syntactic expression of different types of focus; it has three different focus constructions,
and these three constructions correspond closely to LambrechtÕs three focus types. In Lavukaleve, what is
and what is not in focus is clearly marked by the focus construction type used.","[277, 278, 279]"

36715 - CLAUSE C HAININGÔfall/jumpÕ. Sentence b. consists of two coordinate-dependent clauses followed by a
independent clause afoa (the sequence kemus ena taalea oahore ga is a relative
clause). Sentence c. is similar, consisting of two coordinate-dependent predicates
followed by an independent predicate. Sentence d. interrupts the sequence of clause
chaining constructions by introducing three subordinate clauses ote lamege, ote lamege
and oevutiage. These subordinate clauses mark their subject arguments (albeit with the
special subordinate adverbial system which, among other things, marks third person
intransitive subjects as objects; see Section 16.1), and explicitly show their relationship
to the independent verb avo, by the Anterior suffix -ge. The sentence continues,
however, with a clause chaining construction with coordinate-dependent predicates
aore, felere and felere, ending with independent clause avo. Sentence e. shows another
clause chaining construction, with coordinate-dependent predicates vore and akefeurire
(a verb compound), and independent predicate afeu.
Clause chaining constructions are the most common method of joining predicates in a
sequence of events in a narrative in Lavukaleve. They are used to bring the action of the
story forward, for what Hopper and Thompson (1980) call foregrounding; foregrounded
clauses are those clauses which express action sequences which move the storyline
along from event to event. As such, clause chains are not used to set a scene; this means
that the fact that they cannot mark TAM does not matter. When a clause chain is used,
TAM would normally already be understood. Alternatively, it can be marked with an
intervening subordinate clause, as is shown above, or later after the end of the chain.
TAM marking in Lavukaleve is not obligatory, and indeed is relatively infrequent;
usually once a time frame has been established, speakers do not repeat the morphology
which established it.
15.4 DEFINING FEATURES OF COORDINATE -DEPENDENT CLAUSES
Structurally, clause chaining constructions consist of one or more coordinate-dependent
clauses, each one with its own coordinate-dependent predicate, followed by an
independent (main) predicate. This order of clauses is obligatory; the coordinatedependent clauses always precede the independent clause (though see below for an
environment when a coordinate-dependent clause can follow its main clause). The
independent predicate has all the structural possibilities of any independent predicate in
the language. Coordinate-dependent predicates however have a number of special
properties particular to them.
15.4.1 MORPHOLOGYCoordinate-dependent predicate forms are very restricted as to the morphology which
they can take. Transitive coordinate-dependent predicates must take an object prefix;
but no coordinate-dependent predicate can cross-reference its subject. The Causative
suffix can occur on coordinate-dependent predicates. In addition, all coordinate36815 - CLAUSE C HAININGdependent predicates are obligatorily marked with one of three suffixes indicating the
temporal relationship of the coordinate-dependent clause to the next clause. These
suffixes are -re (glossed NF ÔNon-FiniteÕ for reasons explained below), -vel
(COMPLetive) and -vele (SUCCessive). These three suffixes only occur on coordinatedependent verbs. Apart from these affixes, no other morphology is available to
coordinate-dependent predicates.
15.4.2 CLAUSE CHAINS WITH COMPLETIVE -VELThe Completive suffix -vel refers to a fulfilled condition. It marks a clause as having
been finished completely before the action of the next clause. The verb on which it is
suffixed forms a coordinate-dependent predicate, with the meaning ÔHaving completed
X, [then Y]Õ. The implication is that the action or event has only just been completed;
and that upon its completion, then something else was enabled to happen. Note that
clause chains are not used to express events far distant from each other in time, so a
sentence like Ôhaving planted the yams last year, we harvested them todayÕ, would not
be expressed with a clause chain.

first, -vele clause precedes the main clause. The Successive clause means ÔAfter X has
happened, [then Y]Õ. It can also mean ÔwheneverÕ. Note that its meaning is very similar

s2 069Verbs with the Successive suffix often seem semantically subordinate to the following
clause, but syntactically such clauses pattern far more closely with Completive and
Non-Finite clauses rather than with subordinate-dependent clauses.
37015 - CLAUSE C HAINING15.4.4 CLAUSE CHAINS WITH NON-FINITE -REThe Non-Finite suffix is overwhelmingly more frequent than the other two, and it is
semantically less marked. It indicates that the action of the verb on which it appears
forms a temporal sequence with the following clause(s), but without the emphasis on
completion or causal succession which the other two chaining suffixes have. The
frequency of coordinate-dependent clauses with the Non-Finite suffix, as opposed to
either of the other two suffixes, is reflected in the proportions of examples of each in
this chapter.

co 191The Non-Finite suffix -re needs some discussion. In Section 12.2.1 it was shown that a
formally identical suffix -re is a Future Tense marker, which is used in clauses with
reference to future time.
Even though the Non-Finite suffix -re and the Future Tense suffix -re do not co-occur,
it can be shown clearly that there are in fact two suffixes of the form -re. Rather than
being a tense marker, when it appears on coordinate-dependent predicates, it is serving
as a linker indicating that the predicate is non-finite and is taking part in a clause
chaining construction in which the events appear in a sequence.
In coordinate-dependent constructions the Non-Finite suffix -re makes no reference to a
time frame. It can be used with clauses which have reference to past, present or future
time. On main (independent) predicates Future tense suffix -re always expresses future
37115 - CLAUSE C HAININGtense, and can be used only in clauses which have future time reference. Most of the
previous examples have past time reference, as can be seen from the translations.
Future Tense -re is used in full, completely independent, clauses. There are many
examples, of which the following is representative, which show -re marking fully
independent single verbs:

and -re the Future Tense marker. When Non-Finite -re occurs on a coordinatedependent predicate, that predicate cannot mark its subject, as was explained above.
However when Future Tense -re appears on independent predicates, this restriction does
not hold; independent predicates can freely cross-reference their subjects. See the above
example, and the following:

jb 010So the Non-Finite suffix -re is clearly distinguishable from the Future Tense suffix -re,
in terms of semantic and morphological criteria. In clause chain constructions, it serves
as a linker, to mark each coordinate-dependent clauses as belonging to one of a series,
linked to a following independent predicate. Coordinate-dependent predicates, marked
with this suffix, cannot express TAM distinctions or cross-reference their subjects.
These are typical features of non-finite predicates, which indeed coordinate-dependent37215 - CLAUSE C HAININGpredicates are1.
15.4.5 S YNTAXCoordinate-dependent clauses may contain, as well as the coordinate-dependent
predicate, NPs referring to the object and subject of that predicate, plus any number of
adjuncts. Note that, even though coordinate-dependent predicates cannot crossreference their subjects, coordinate-dependent clauses can contain an NP referring to
this subject. See for example sentence (11) above. Note also the following:

mn2 060It is not necessary that clause chaining constructions share any of their arguments,
although usually they tend to. Unlike in many of the languages which have
constructions of this type, in Lavukaleve there is no grammatical device to show
whether a coordinate-dependent predicate has the same subject as the independent
predicate of the construction. The following set of examples illustrate this. To make
exposition simpler, they have all been taken from the same story, about a magical
mother whale and her two sons.
In the following sentence, the subject of the first coordinate-dependent clause ekurure
Ôhit itÕ is not stated but is known to be Ôthe whale (f)Õ, from the previous sentence. The
next coordinate-dependent clause of the sequence, oinala sou falere Ôthey two (m) got
upÕ, introduces a new subject with the demonstrative pronoun oinala. The third
coordinate-dependent clause of the sequence, roge foiga soire Ôone of them ranÕ, has a
new subject again: expressed by the NP roge with ellipsed head and resumptive
pronoun foiga. This clause is basically repeated for clarity; the canoe referred to is the
1Perhaps the name Ônon-finiteÕ is not ideal for this suffix, because coordinate-dependent verbs are all
non-finite, so all three coordinate-dependent clause markers, -vele, -vel and -re, are markers of non-finite
clauses. However the name was chosen to highlight the fact that -re is semantically and distributionally
by far the least marked of the three, and thus the most general gloss is perhaps appropriate.","[393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399]"
"39716 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSES16.3 RELATIVE CLAUSES
Relative clauses are clauses which modify an NP, the head. All relative clauses in
Lavukaleve are restrictive; that is, they function to restrict the reference of the head
from any number of possible referents to only those described in the relative clause.
LavukaleveÕs relative clauses are internal relative clauses. Keenan (1985: 163) notes
that internal relative clauses are ill-attested in the languages of the world, but that all the
languages in which they are known to occur have a basic constituent order of SOV.
Lavukaleve certainly fits this generalisation.
In internal relative clauses the head noun, that is, the noun referring to the common
argument shared by the main clause and the relative clause, functions syntactically as
part of the relative clause, not as part of the main clause. In Lavukaleve, as in many
languages with internal relativisation (Keenan 1985: 163), there is no overt marker of
relativisation.
As there is no overt marker of relativisation, the only feature by which relative clauses
can be recognised in Lavukaleve is that they consist of a clause inside an NP. Consider
the following examples:
50)meham
me1pl.in-ham
forolugurem
o3sgS-lugu
respectsevo
sevo
vow(m)
-re
-FUTosum
o3sgS-su

sgmArtpr 084-m
-sgmI saw the man who ate my fish.na
na
sgmArtalem
fin.
ale -m
fin
1sgS- see -sgm 3sgmFOC
e3 008h/2In the first example, the whole relative clause consists of meham sevo osum Ôa promise
he made to usÕ. The head noun sevo occurs after the postpositional phrase and before
the relative verb. The relative clause functions as a noun, and is followed by the definite
article. The NP thus formed functions as the object of the main verb olugurem Ôhe will
respect itÕ.
In the second example, the italicised relative clause ali ngafo'sal aum Ôthe man who ate
my fishÕ is followed by the definite article, and functions as the object of the main
clause. This NP is the argument shared by the main clause and the relative clause.
Structurally, such examples consist of a clause followed by a definite article. Relative
39816 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESclauses appear in the position in which adjectives appear in NPs in Lavukaleve; and
note also that both relative clauses and adjectives show agreement with their head noun
using the Agreement Suffix.
The predicates of relative clauses are always marked with the Agreement Suffix. The
Agreement Suffix agrees with the head, which helps to show which argument is the
head of the relative clause.
The head, like any noun argument in Lavukaleve, does not have to be overt. It is always
retrievable, and in any case it is cross-referenced on the relative predicate and the
definite article, and often also on the main predicate. The following example shows a
relative clause without an overt head:
52)Aka kini
aka kini

oesia-le
3sgfO- SBD- do -POTme
HABIf [anything] went missing, they would have known it.co2 064The missing head, which would occur immediately preceding kini tataveuarea if it was
present, is presumably mina ÔthingÕ, which is feminine, and thus controls the feminine
agreement.
The head is usually a noun, but it can be a demonstrative pronoun from the oia
paradigm (see Section 8.7). It cannot be any other type of pronoun or demonstrative.
Example (57) below shows a relative clause with the oia demonstrative pronoun as
head.
The head of the relative clause may have any syntactic role in the relative clause, and
also may be in any syntactic role with respect to its function in the main clause,
although it is questionable whether it is possible to relativise on possessors (see below).
That is, the head can function as S, A, O, or postpositional object in either clause.
The predicate of a relative clause must be suffixed with the Agreement Suffix, but
otherwise has the full range of morphological possibilities of any predicate suffixed
with the Agreement Suffix (see Chapter 10 for a discussion of the functions and
morpho-syntax of the Agreement Suffix). It may also be a complex predicate; examples
(57) and (61) contain respectively a verbal complex with the Habitual Auxiliary and a
serial verb construction as predicates of relative clauses. Examples (63) and (64) are
interesting in that the relative clauses each contain two predicates, one an independent
Imperfective-marked verb, followed by another independent verb marked with the
Agreement Suffix. In fact relative clauses can consist of strings of independent clauses
like these, or indeed complex structures with subordinate clauses, or clause chains as in
39916 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESthe example below:

work(f)The first thing I want to talk about, is mother's work. [lit: in the first thing I am wanting to talk
about, [itÕs] motherÕs work]
emk 001In the above example, the relative clause consists of a clause chaining construction (see
Chapter 15). The clause elikire Ôwanting itÕ has a nominalised object va'var hai Ôto
talkÕ, which is a coordinate-dependent clause in a clause chain, of which the
independent predicate is alei ÔI amÕ. In complex relative clause structures like this, the
principle is that the complex structure appears as it would elsewhere, but, in addition to
whatever other participant marking is called for by the construction (see Section 9.7),
the final verb of the clause receives the Agreement Suffix cross-referencing the head.
The main clause contains any elements which any main clause would normally contain.
Thus, there are two main features that distinguish relative clauses from other
construction types in Lavukaleve. Firstly, the relative clause appears inside an NP.
Secondly, the predicate of the relative clause always has the Agreement Suffix; and it
can be followed immediately by the definite article. In all other construction types, if a
predicate is followed by the definite article, the predicate must appear with the
Nominaliser suffix (described in Section 13.1); only in relative clauses can a nonnominalised predicate be followed immediately by the definite article. Note that the
definite article is not an obligatory part of the relative clause construction; it belongs to
the NP which is an argument of the verb of the relative clause. The definite article is in
its normal function as in any NP (see Section 4.1.2 for a discussion of the definite
article).
However if there was no definite article, there would be no means of recognising a
relative clause structurally as any different from an independent clause followed by
another independent clause. Consider the following example:
54)Bongihehev vone,

1sgS- stayI stayed doing work with heathens, with people who do not know the church. [lit: with people
who didn't know the church I stayed doing work]
am 06740016 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESIn this example, the italicised part, malav mima evealav, could be seen as functionally
a relative clause, with shared argument malav functioning as subject of the relative
clause and postpositional object of the main clause. However there is no syntactic
evidence that it is a relative clause: the sentence could translate as Ôwith the heathens,
the people who donÕt know the church, with them, I stayed workingÕ; thus, as a string of
independent clauses. The only structures recognised in this description as syntactically
relative clauses are those which do involve a definite article immediately following a
verb.
Note that it is perhaps possible to analyse these structures as independent clauses, with
the definite article functioning not as a definite article but rather as a kind of resumptive
determiner; thus, example (51) could be paraphrased as Ôthe man ate my fish: him, I
sawÕ. However there are a few arguments against this analysis. Firstly, resumptive
pronouns do occur in Lavukaleve, but they are demonstrative pronouns from the foia
paradigm (see Section 8.4). This is only a minor problem. Secondly, and more
importantly, it is never possible to put a definite article anywhere after the head noun,
apart from directly after the relative verb, which is at the end of the NP under the
analysis presented here. It is certainly not possible to add another definite article after
the head noun, for example (again using 51):
55)*Ali

man(m) sgmArt 1sgPOSS- fish(m) 3sgmO- eat -sgm sgmArt 1sgS- see -sgm 3sgmFOCThis suggests that the definite article is indeed functioning in its normal definite article
function, rather than as a resumptive determiner. This in turn suggests that the analysis
here, that these structures are indeed relative clauses, is correct.
It was stated above that the head of the relative clause, that is, the argument shared
between the relative clause and the main clause, can be in any grammatical function
with respect to both the main clause and the relative clause, including any combination
of S, A, O or postpositional object. It is generally not, however, possible to relativise on
possessors. As a matter of fact, there is one example in the corpus of a relative clause
with a possessor as head. The example is:
56)Hogariom

village.
jn 036 - jn 037The head is Ôthey (the owners of the village and baskets)Õ, which is ellipsed, expressed
only in the Possessive prefix on losiv Ôtheir basketsÕ.
40116 - SUBORDINATE C LAUSESHowever the example is problematic for two reasons. Most importantly, as the
punctuation shows, the relative clause is in its own intonation unit, followed by a
sentence-final drop in pitch (indicated by the full stop). The intonation is hesitant
(slashes indicate pauses on level pitch), suggesting that the sentence is perhaps not a
complete or fluent example. Secondly, this is the only example of relativising on a
possessor. If this is a possibility in Lavukaleve, it is a possibility rarely utilised by
speakers. The area needs to be thoroughly checked with Lavukaleve speakers before
any conclusions can be drawn.
The following examples show all possible combinations of the syntactic roles of shared
arguments. Unlike the above construction, these relative clauses are quite frequent and
well-attested as an important part of Lavukaleve grammar.

hr1 029This last example is particularly interesting in that the predicate of the relative clause, ao-sea-a, is indexed for three participants: object and subject are indexed by prefixes;
and the head of the relative clause, a postpositional object, is indexed with the
Agreement Suffix. This is one of the few constructions in which a predicate can be
cross-referenced for three arguments.
In other construction types, the Agreement Suffix only indexes subjects or objects. In
relative clauses, however, it always indexes the head, and as the head may be in the
syntactic roles of subject, object or postpositional object, the Agreement Suffix in
relative clauses may in fact index arguments in the syntactic role of object of
postposition. The functions of the Agreement Suffix are discussed in detail in Chapter
10.","[423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"

ja 099Subordinate clauses in the languages of the world are usually thought of as presupposed
information, rather than asserted information, and thus are unlikely to be focussed. In
many languages it is not possible to focus on a subordinate clause; Somali for instance,
which has a pervasive grammaticalised focus system, is typical in not allowing focus
marking in subordinate clauses (Saeed 1984: 24). However Lavukaleve very frequently
focuses on dependent clauses. In Lavukaleve the reasons for this may lie in the types of
information typically supplied by dependent and main clauses respectively.
Firstly, dependent structures in Papuan languages are typically used to carry the event line
of the narrative forward. Anything which carries the event line forward is new,
newsworthy, rather than presupposed information. This is the case, for example, in
examples (59) and (60).
Further, complex clause and sentence structures in Lavukaleve typically encode
semantically full verbs as dependent verbs, and aspectual verbs as main verbs. This
means that the lexically most important part of a sentence is typically the dependent verb,
rather than the main verb. This can be seen clearly in sentences like (57) and (58), which
both contain focussed coordinate-dependent clauses carrying the main semantic weight of
the sentence, with the main clauses in each providing aspectual information. A similar
type of situation occurs in serial verb constructions and verbal complexes with the
Habitual Auxiliary ((61) and (62) respectively). So often argument focus constructions
focus on the part of a complex structure which carries the most semantic weight. In these
27011 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSterms, such constructions make sense.
11.4 TWO RARE PHENOMENA
The basic morpho-syntactic features of the focus system have been outlined above, and
further important issues to do with focus marking are discussed further below. But first,
there are two phenomena to do with the focus system, both of them rare, which should
first be mentioned. The first is that occasionally a Sentence-Final focus construction,
rather than a Sentence-Internal focus construction, can be used to express focus on a
postpositional phrase. The second is that there are some instances in the corpus in which a
demonstrative modifier occurs in the position in which a focus marker would be expected,
in a Sentence-Final focus construction.
11.4.1 ANOTHER WAY OF EXPRESSING ARGUMENT FOCUS OF PPSIt was shown above that in Sentence-Final focus constructions the focus marker always
agrees with the subject or object; and they express sentence or predicate focus
accordingly. For expressing focus on an adjunct, a Sentence-Internal focus construction
is almost always used. However there are extremely rare examples (three in the entire
corpus) of a Sentence-Final focus construction, where the focus marker agrees not with
the subject or object but with a postpositional phrase, and expresses argument focus on
that postpositional phrase:

Noun phrases and possession
This chapter outlines the structure of NPs, and then describes in detail the elements
which can modify a head noun. These elements include adjectives (including numbers),
demonstrative modifiers and the definite article. Two particularly frequently occurring
adjectives, ro ÔoneÕ and mea ÔSPECifierÕ are discussed in detail. The structure of
possessive phrases and the semantic characteristics of the possessive construction are
also examined.
4.1 THE STRUCTURE OF NPS
An NP consists of a head, and, if this is a noun, it may be followed by optional
modifiers including adjectives. The Specifier adjective mea and the adjective ro ÔoneÕ
follow other adjectives and the final slot of the NP is filled, optionally, by the definite
article or a demonstrative modifier. If the head is a demonstrative or personal pronoun,
the only modification it can have is a demonstrative modifier. This word order is
obligatory. The only modifiers which can precede a nominal head are possessors, but
these occur in their own NP preceding the NP of the head noun.
The following schema outlines the maximal structure of NPs in Lavukaleve:694 - NPS AND P OSSESSIONNP -> (Poss P)ìN Adj* mea ÔSPECÕ ro ÔoneÕ ìArt

4.1.1 HEADS OF NPSNouns and demonstrative and personal pronouns may function as heads of NPs. The
head controls agreement within the NP (and in the clause).
Some examples follow, of an NP consisting of an unmodified noun head, a modified

co 299E LLIPSIS OF HEADSHeads of NPs can be ellipsed if their referent is retrievable from context. In the
following example, the NP bakel sevoa consists of two adjectives and an ellipsed head,
which, although not present in the sentence, controls the agreement of sevoa. Note that
bakel is an irregular adjective, in that it does not show agreement.

co 2914.1.2 MODIFICATION IN NPSAdjectives, the demonstrative modifier and the definite article may be used to modify a
head noun. Demonstrative and personal pronouns may be modified by the
demonstrative modifier only. The maximal NP structure given above makes some broad
claims which should be commented on. Firstly, the schema indicates that any number of
adjectives may occur in an NP. Actually, in texts no more than three have been found
per NP, and elicitation speakers were unwilling to allow more than two or three
adjectives within an NP, preferring instead to use a series of shorter sentences, or to use
intransitive verbs rather than adjectives. Secondly, while other adjectives can occur in
any order with respect to each other, if ro ÔoneÕ occurs with other adjectives, it must be
the final one. The next sections describe in turn the elements which can be used for
modification of a head noun inside an NP.
A DJECTIVESAs described in Section 3.3, adjectives are a closed class with only around fifty
members. They occur after a head noun, and they agree in number and gender with their
714 - NPS AND P OSSESSIONhead, using the Agreement Suffix (see Section 10.4). Most adjectives use the
Agreement Suffix to show agreement; some, like ro ÔoneÕ, ru ÔbigÕ, telako ÔoneÕ and
lelaol ÔtwoÕ have their own inflectional paradigms. Some, like bakel ÔbigÕ and the
numbers from three to ten do not show agreement. Some examples:

ch 003There are two adjectives which deserve special mention here: ro Ôunit, oneÕ and mea
ÔSPECifierÕ. These adjectives, as well as being extremely frequent, bear some
resemblance in terms of their functions to the demonstrative modifier; these interesting
features merit discussion.
RO ÔONEÕThere is an indefinite adjective ro ÔoneÕ. It also has a special use, not as a modifier but
as a head, in which case it means Ôthe oneÕ, Ôthe otherÕ; that is, it has a definite and/or
contrastive meaning.
Ro ÔoneÕ (cited in the feminine singular form), while functioning syntactically as a
regular adjective, is morphologically irregular in that it has its own inflectional
paradigm for person/number agreement. It differs from other adjectives
morphologically also in that it has a special suffix -ru, added to the inflected word, to
negate it. The inflectional paradigm of ro (given also in Section 3.3) is as follows:MASC

nonetheless distributionally a perfectly normal adjective.

"34614 - COMPLEX P REDICATESFoley and Van Valin (1984), Foley and Olson (1985) and Crowley (1987), among
others, consider the distinction between core and nuclear layer serialisation. In
CrowleyÕs terms Òthe two kinds of serialisation differ basically in that while core layer
serialisation allows some degree of independence to the two verbs in the choice of
nominal arguments associated with each, this is not the case with nuclear layer
serialisationÓ (1987: 58); and further, Ò[in core layer serialisation] each verb
independently chooses its own noun phrase argumentsÓ (1987: 41).
In Lavukaleve, all verbs of a serial verb construction must share their subject arguments
as well as all adjuncts and all morphological categories, and transitive verbs must share
their object arguments. They cannot independently choose their arguments. For this
reason, LavukaleveÕs serial verb constructions can be classified as nuclear layer
serialisation. Note that there is a tendency pointed out by Crowley (1987: 42) that SOV
languages (of which Lavukaleve is one) Òtend to prefer nuclear juncture between verbs
when they have serial constructions, and for SVO languages to prefer core junctureÓ.
Lavukaleve, then, accords with this general tendency.
14.2 VERB COMPOUNDS
There are only three verb compounds in Lavukaleve; they are probably lexicalised serial
verb constructions. A verb compound consists of two phonological words but only one
grammatical word.
On the surface, verb compounds differ from serial verb constructions only in their
participant marking system, but this difference points to very different fundamental
structures. Verb compounds consist of two lexical verbs, but, whereas in serial verb
constructions the subject is marked only once, on the final member of the serial verb
construction, and the object is cross-referenced separately on each transitive verb, verb
compounds display the participant marking which would be expected on a simple
predicate. That is, subject and object are marked once only across the predicate, and
subjects can be cross-referenced either by a prefix (thus on the first verb of the
predicate) or by a suffix (thus on the second verb). They cannot be marked by a suffix
on the first verb or a prefix on the second verb. The verb roots must be contiguous.
The three verb compounds in Lavukaleve are ke vau-ri Ôpush sth outÕ [push put out], ke
feu-ri Ôpush sth up [push put up]Õ, and sou fale-ri Ôstand sth upÕ [rise stand sth up]. The
first two are the most common way of talking about maneuvering canoes onto and off
beaches. They involve the transitive verb k e ÔpushÕ, followed by a causativised
intransitive verb; vau Ôgo out seawardsÕ and feu Ôgo up inlandÕ. The third, sou faleri, is
not as frequently used as the first two. An example:34714 - COMPLEX P REDICATES

3plO- rise stand -CAUS[We] help the sick to stand up again [lit: stand the dying back up],am 061This compound consists of two verbs, intransitive sou Ôrise, go upÕ and derived
transitive fale Ôstand upÕ. The two verbs, as always in verb compounds, have their own
stress, and thus are two phonological words. There is no subject cross-reference in this
example. The Causative suffix appears at the end of the verb sequence, but the
obligatory object indexing which appears with all transitive verbs, whether they are
causativised intransitives or base transitives, appears on the first verb, not on the verb
with the Causative suffix. In all other sequences of transitive verbs in Lavukaleve, each
one must be indexed for its object. The fact that this derived transitive verb is not shows
that it is crucially different from serial verb constructions, and indeed from all other
verbs. The explanation is simple, however; verb compounds treat both verbs as one, and
they cross-reference their arguments accordingly. Further examples follow.
In the next example, both verbs are transitive (ke is base transitive, vau is derived
transitive), and both subject and object are cross-referenced at the beginning of the
predicate:

...in the evening they pushed out their canoe. The war canoe.jn 009In the following example, the subject is cross-referenced at the beginning of the
predicate, and the object at the end. Thus, even though both verbs are transitive, object
cross-referencing occurs only once:
23)malav

...it [the sea during a cyclone] pushes the canoe and the people out.ja 224Thus, it is clear that the verb sequences discussed in this section are not the same as
serial verb constructions, because of the participant marking system.
Note that sou and fale can also occur intransitively, without any Causative suffix:34814 - COMPLEX P REDICATES

is a serial verb construction. The criterial difference between the two is in the
participant marking, particularly the object marking. If both members of the sequence
are intransitive, there is nothing on which a decision can be based. Put differently, in
such cases there is no distinction between serial verb constructions and verb
compounds. In this description, unless the sequence is definitely a verb compound, the
two verbs are always written separately.
It is probable that verb compounds represent a lexicalisation of serial verb
constructions. However unlike verb compounds in many languages, these compounds
have predictable semantics; their meanings are readily derivable from their individual
components. There are only three of these verb compounds, and two of these occur
relatively commonly. From that alone a claim for lexicalisation could be justified.
14.3 THE HABITUAL AUXILIARY
The Habitual Auxiliary, which forms another kind of complex predicate, is extremely
frequent in Lavukaleve discourse. It is used to express events which are habitual,
characteristic or typical. It is also used for events which take some time to carry out.
The Habitual Auxiliary is very frequently used in narratives about what the ancestors
used to do, and also in procedural texts explaining how people make or do things.
The Habitual Auxiliary is the sole member of its word class, and indeed is the only
auxiliary in the language. There is also an intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ; it is
discussed below, Section 14.3.3, by way of comparison with the formally identical
Habitual Auxiliary. The Habitual Auxiliary always occurs in construction with and
following another verb; the verb + auxiliary constituent is called a verbal complex. The
Habitual Auxiliary me never occurs without a verb, and it does not have valency, but,
with its verb, takes arguments according to that verbÕs valency. It does however take
certain verbal morphology, including the subordinate adverbial suffixes Anterior -ge,
Potential -le, the Admonitive -n, the Future -re (in certain constrained circumstances)
and the Agreement Suffix.
The members of the verbal complex share their arguments, and participant marking is
shared between them, in a very particular way. The Habitual Auxiliary can only ever
cross-reference the subject (S/A), never the object argument (with one exception,34914 - COMPLEX P REDICATESoutlined below). The verb can only cross-reference the object, if it is transitive, never
the subject. The Habitual Auxiliary can use either a special subject prefix, or else the
Agreement Suffix, to cross-reference the subject. Unlike with verbs, the subject crossreference on the Habitual Auxiliary is obligatory.
First consider some examples of these verbal complexes:

-sgmShe goes out to the sea shore, she is standing up for a long time, and he [the husband] comes
ashore.
co 340In each of the above examples, the Habitual Auxiliary me immediately follows a verb,
and, together with that verb, forms the predicate of the clause. The verbal complex takes
a subject argument, cross-referenced as a prefix or suffix on me, and, if the verbal
complex is transitive, also takes an object argument, cross-referenced as a prefix on the
verb. Verbal complexes take their valency from the verb of the complex; me is not a
verb and has no inherent valency.
The only thing that can intervene between a verb and a Habitual Auxiliary in a verbal
complex is the focus marker; and this can only occur if the Habitual Auxiliary is crossreferenced for its subject by a prefix, not if it is cross-referenced for its subject by the
Agreement Suffix. The focus marker (see Section 11.3.3) can be used to mark focus on
the lexical part of the verbal complex. Apart from this, no other non-obligatory elements
can be a part of the verbal complex. An example of a focus marker in a verbal complex
can be seen at (36) below.
It was stated above that the Habitual Auxiliary must always cross-reference the subject
argument of the verbal complex in which it appears. Like verbs, it can use either a
35014 - COMPLEX P REDICATESprefix or the Agreement Suffix to cross-reference this subject (though the prefix
paradigm used is slightly different to that of verbs). And also as with verbs, there are
important semantic differences between a verbal complex with the Habitual Auxiliary
when it receives prefixes to cross-reference its subject versus one when it uses the
Agreement Suffix for this purpose, as is discussed in detail in Chapter 10. The same
kinds of semantic distinctions are apparent when the Agreement Suffix is used on a
verbal complex involving a Habitual Auxiliary. The following section discusses the
prefixing of the Habitual Auxiliary. The section after that discusses the semantic and
syntactic differences of the Habitual Auxiliary when it cross-references its subject using
the Agreement Suffix.
Prefixed forms and suffixed forms of the Habitual Auxiliary are discussed separately
here simply for the purposes of exposition, because the prefixed forms are
morphologically a little complex and take some space to explain. But the reader should
bear in mind that the major semantic and syntactic differences between prefixed forms
and forms marked with the Agreement Suffix are the same as the differences between
verbs when prefixed and verbs when appearing with the Agreement Suffix; the
differences follow on from the fundamental distinction in Lavukaleve between crossreferencing with prefixes versus cross-referencing with the Agreement Suffix; and as
such, these differences are not unique to the Habitual Auxiliary at all, but rather are just
another reflection of a fundamental feature of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax.
14.3.1 THE HABITUAL A UXILIARYÕS SUBJECT PREFIXESThe Habitual Auxiliary has its own unique set of subject prefixes with which it crossreferences the subject of the verbal complex in which it appears. The paradigm is as
follows:
HABITUAL AUXILIARY SUBJECT PREFIXES
SG1EXCL

3DUla-PLleme-ngo-melelo-ma-(In subordinate adverbial constructions the Habitual Auxiliary, like intransitive verbs,
takes object prefixes to cross-reference its subject in the third person and adds a special
subordinate e- prefix in the normal subject prefix slot; see Section 16.1).
The Habitual Auxiliary subject prefixes are based on the subject prefixes used on verbs,
with the addition of initial /l/ in all those forms which are vowel-initial in the verbal35114 - COMPLEX P REDICATESsubject prefixes1. Some examples of this system of subject prefixing:

3duS- HAB-du
ja 012The last example shows a further morphological point: that Habitual Auxiliaries with
third person dual subjects frequently suffix a dual suffix -l to their form. This is not
obligatory, but it is nevertheless quite common. Note that this dual suffix does not occur
with 1st and 2nd person dual subjects. Dual marking is pervasive in Lavukaleve, and its
most common manifestation is /l/, or some form containing /l/. Note that this dual suffix
is not the Agreement Suffix. The Agreement Suffix dual forms are marked for gender:
-mal (masculine); -aol (feminine) and -gel (neuter).
Occasionally when a Habitual Auxiliary with a subject prefix occurs in a Sentence-Final
focus construction, the argument of the verbal complex which the focus marker agrees
with is cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix on the Habitual Auxiliary, and the
Habitual Auxiliary also retains its subject prefixing. This leads to the anomalous
situation of an argument being cross-referenced twice within the same predicate. The
following are examples of this situation. Note that Ôstern of a boatÕ is plural in
Lavukaleve. The object argument ÔsternÕ is cross-referenced by the prefix on the verb
ma ÔtakeÕ, and also by the Agreement Suffix on the Habitual Auxiliary and the focus
marker; thus it is cross-referenced twice within one predicate.","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378]"

(all extinct)Todd (1975) attempts to formalise the proposal of a genetic relationship between
Lavukaleve, Bilua, Savosavo and Baniata, by means of comparison of morphological
forms in the four languages. Todd used her own data for the classification, which was
far more extensive than the data used by Greenberg and Wurm. She tentatively
subgroups Savosavo and Bilua more closely together than Lavukaleve and Baniata, and
she also suggests that Yele (Rossel Island) may be part of the same family, based on
independent pronoun paradigms, possessive prefixes, noun number suffixes and
vocabulary.
If Lavukaleve does have any relatives, these other three Solomon Islands Papuan
languages, Savosavo, Bilua, and Baniata are the strongest candidates. However they are
structurally very different to Lavukaleve, and indeed to each other, and a genetic
relationship may be difficult to demonstrate. As Capell notes, ÒThese languages [Bilua,
Baniata, Kazukuru, Lavukaleve and Savosavo] share some common vocabulary, but it
is small, and they are more outstanding for their differences not only from
[Austronesian languages] but amongst themselvesÓ (1969: 2).
ToddÕs work is suggestive, but far more work needs to be done on basic grammatical
description of these languages before any firm conclusions about their past are possible.
This grammar, as well as that of Obata (in prep.) on Bilua, is a step in this direction.
1.3.3 MORE RECENT CONTACTLavukaleve has long been surrounded by Austronesian languages, but Tryon and
HackmanÕs (1983) counts of shared lexical items in languages of the Solomon Islands
show that it shares comparatively little of their vocabulary; and indeed comparatively
71 - I NTRODUCTIONlittle with the Papuan languages in the area as well.
Shared lexical percentages between the Papuan and Austronesian languages in the
Solomons are very low (Wurm 1982: 234). The highest shared lexical percentage
between Lavukaleve and a Papuan language is 13.7% (from a comparison of 197
words), with Savosavo (all figures in this section are from Tryon and Hackman 1983).
Lavukaleve shares 7.6% of its lexicon with Bilua (comparison of 197 words) and 8.2%
with Baniata (comparison of 195 words). Austronesian languages on Guadalcanal, the
nearest land mass to the Russells, generally share around 8.5% with Lavukaleve. Poro,
spoken on Santa Isabel, shares 8.9% (from a comparison of 190 words), and Nggela,
from Florida (and widespread as a missionary-encouraged lingua franca) shares 8.7%
(comparison of 196 words), and Langalanga from Malaita shares 8.2% (comparison of
195 words). Most other languages of the Solomons share around 4% or 5% with
Lavukaleve.
These shared lexical percentage figures are very low. As a comparison, Austronesian
languages in the Solomon Islands tend to share around 30%-50% vocabulary with each
other. Lavukaleve shares at most 10.8% with any other Austronesian language (Paripao,
a Lengo language from north-east Guadalcanal).
Thorough comparison of LavukaleveÕs grammar with the grammars of nearby
Austronesian languages is necessary to determine whether, and what kind of, linguistic
borrowing has taken place between them. This thesis is merely the first step in this
process.
In various places throughout this thesis, some comparison is made to various
Austronesian languages, usually where there is a strikingly similar grammatical pattern
to something in Austronesian languages, or evidence of Austronesian loan words in a
particular area of Lavukaleve grammar. The Russell Islands are surrounded on three
sides by islands with Austronesian-speaking people. Lavukal stories tell of a long
history of contact between the people of New Georgia, Santa Isabel and Guadalcanal
and the Russells. For this reason, I generally make comparisons with Austronesian
languages from those areas. Because of the scarcity of linguistic data from many of
these areas, I make most reference to Tolo, a language from south-east Guadalcanal,
which has a dictionary and grammatical sketch (Smith Crowley 1986); Cheke Holo, a
Santa Isabel language with a dictionary and grammatical sketch (White 1988); and
Roviana, a New Georgia language, again with a dictionary and grammatical sketch
(Whitehead 1949). I also have recourse to Proto Oceanic reconstructions, especially
from Ross, Pawley and Osmond (1998).
It is of course far easier to show that a word is Austronesian in origin, than to show
exactly which language Lavukaleve borrowed the word from. When I refer to a word
from a particular Austronesian language, I am not making a claim that that was the
language from which the word was borrowed into Lavukaleve; I am just showing that
81 - I NTRODUCTIONthe word is borrowed. Many words are also borrowed from Solomon Island Pijin; these
words are usually immediately recognisable.
1.4 PREVIOUS WORK ON LAVUKALEVE
Ray (1928) presents some data on Lavukaleve (he calls it Laumbe), including a partial
pronoun paradigm, some information on numerals, possession and adjectives, a few
sentences and a 30-word vocabulary. Capell did some field work on Lavukaleve in
1960, some of which is published in a brief comparative grammatical sketch of
Lavukaleve, Bilua, Baniata and Savosavo (Capell 1969). Todd did a week of field work
on Lavukaleve in 1972-1973 and published a somewhat longer comparative sketch of it
and Bilua, Baniata and Savosavo in Todd (1975). Black (1963), an ethnographic study
of Russell Islanders, is the only other work concerning Lavukal people.
1.5 THE LANGUAGE SITUATION TODAY
In 1954, Capell said of Lavukaleve: ÒIt is spoken only by some 250 people, but a record
should be made of it before it is swamped by Bugotu. There is no doubt that this is what
will ultimately happenÓ (Capell 1954: 85).
This prediction is based on the fact that Bugotu was for some time the lingua franca of
the Melanesian Mission in Santa Isabel and the Russells (Capell 1954: 84), and, given
the small number of speakers Capell found, his prediction was reasonable. However
things have not developed as he expected. The influence of Bugotu has declined, to the
extent that no Lavukal I know speaks it. At the same time, the Solomon Islands has
experienced a population explosion; with a growth rate of 3.5% (Solomon Islands
National Literacy Committee 1992), the Solomon Islands has more people now than it
ever has had. And until recently, this expanded population has been in the villages,
living the traditional lifestyle and speaking vernacular languages. Lavukaleve has more
speakers now than it has ever had.
However, even though the Lavukal population has grown, Lavukaleve itself is seriously
threatened, but the threat comes not from Bugotu but from Pijin and English. Solomon
Island Pijin, the lingua franca for the whole country, has a strong influence in the
Russells. All radio broadcasts are in Pijin or English. The language of the church (both
Anglican and Catholic) is mostly English, although there are some Anglican church
services in Lavukaleve (Church of England in New Zealand 1951, c.1973, and Church
of England in Melanesia 1975), and translation of more liturgies is in progress. School
is conducted in English and Pijin. Apart from the Church of Melanesia orders of
service, there are currently no reading materials available to Lavukal people, written in
Lavukaleve. The languages of the outside world are Pijin and English. Even though
Lavukaleve is the first language for most Lavukals, most people, especially younger
people, are also fluent in Pijin. In the West Russells, people live a very traditional
91 - I NTRODUCTIONlifestyle and have little access to town and outside influences, and all children grow up
learning Lavukaleve as their first language. In the East Russells however, an area much
closer to Yandina both geographically and socially, Pijin is slowly taking over, and
many families do not speak Lavukaleve to their children. As a result, many of the
families I talked to in the East Russells have children who cannot speak Lavukaleve.
This situation of people preferring to use the language of the outside world rather than
their vernacular language is a story familiar from all over the world. For the Lavukals,
the situation will probably get worse as more people move to town to access outside
resources. Experience already shows that when this happens, Lavukaleve may quickly
be lost.
1.6 THE NATURE OF THE DATA USED IN THIS THESIS
The data used in this thesis was collected by me, during three field trips taken between
1995 and 1998. A total of ten months was spent in the field. I lived in Mane Village, in
the family of Patterson Barua, the chief of the Keruval tribe. It was not chance that led
me to this village of all the Russells villages. The West Russells is acknowledged by
Lavukals to have the best language speakers, who do not mix their language with Pijin,
so it was deemed most suitable for me to learn Lavukaleve in the West. Mane was
chosen because Patterson, as well as being a very important man, and therefore an
appropriate person to look after a foreigner and teach me the language, is also engaged
in translating the prayer book of the Anglican Church of Melanesia into Lavukaleve.
Most of my data consists of recorded stories, told by people from most of the villages of
the West Russells. I have about 60 such stories, in total around eight hours of speech.
The stories are traditional stories of the Lavukal people (for instance, origin myths,
many stories about giants and magical old ladies, stories about magical animals and so
on), life histories, stories about particular experiences (for instance getting married, an
exciting fishing adventure), history stories (for instance earthquakes and cyclones and
how various villages were started, how the Christian church came to the Russells), and
procedural texts explaining to me how to do things (for instance how to weave mats,
how to make traditional pudding, how to go kite-fishing).
Most of the stories in my corpus are told by men; it is very difficult for women to
overcome their shyness of the recording machine; but as people got to know me better, I
got more and more stories by women. The stories by women are all told by personal
friends in villages where I have spent some considerable time. In villages where I only
visited for a few days, I usually only got stories by men. The speakers range in age from
late teens to their seventies.
The stories were narrated as monologues, into the tape recorder, with me and usually
Patterson present, and, often, with a group of interested listeners also. Most people were
very nervous of the tape recorder, and a couple of people wrote their stories down first,
101 - I NTRODUCTIONthen read them into the machine. These stories were not used for anything involving
intonation.
The corpus also consists of some thousands of sentences written down by me, either
elicited, or heard in conversation, or explicitly taught to me. There is also PattersonÕs
translation of parts of the prayer book of the Church of Melanesia.
All the stories were transcribed by Patterson and me, and have been checked at least
three times. Elicited sentences also were checked when they were written down.
PattersonÕs prayer service translations have been checked extensively by him, and also
by both of us together.
Patterson acted as my main linguistic informant. We spoke Solomon Pijin for work
sessions. I was taught to speak Lavukaleve by everyone I interacted with, which was
mostly Patterson and his wife Monica, my neighbour Emily, my friend Marion, as well
as most of the Mane children. Most of my interaction in the village was conducted in
Pijin initially, moving more to Lavukaleve as I learnt more. I am at best only a partial
speaker at this stage.
Most of my time was spent in Mane village, but I also stayed in most of the other
villages of the West Russells and collected data from nearly all of them. I have visited
some of the Eastern villages; notably Loun and Alokan, but I have no data from there.
For logistical reasons of transport difficulties, and also for political reasons to do with
my affiliation with PattersonÕs faction, I was able to spend very little time in the East.
For these reasons, my corpus consists entirely of the speech variety of the West
Russells.
1.7 TYPOLOGICAL OVERVIEW OF LAVUKALEVE
Lavukaleve has a medium-sized consonant phoneme inventory, with three places of
articulation for stops (b, t, k) and nasals (m, n, ng). There is a marginal voicing
distinction, in the two bilabial stops (p, b) and the two alveolar stops (t, d), but this
distinction pertains mostly to loan words. There are three fricative phonemes (f, s, h),
two approximants: a voiced velar approximant (g) and an unrounded bilabial
approximant (v), and one rhotic and one lateral. There is a five-vowel system (i, e, a, o,
u). Unusually for the region4 there is no contrasting series of oral versus prenasalised
stops (although prenasalised allophones of the voiced stops do exist). Syllables can be
open or closed, and consonant clusters consisting of two consonants, as well as
unlimited vowel sequences, occur frequently. Stress is unpredictable, although it most
commonly falls on the initial syllable of a word.
There are two major word classes in Lavukaleve: nouns and verbs. There are also a

single participant is cross-referenced in two different places in one predicate, in
violation of the first principle given above.
In serial verb constructions (see above and Section 14.1), all transitive members of the
serial verb construction mark their object, which must be shared by each transitive verb;
but the subject can be marked only once, on the final verb of the construction. In the
following example, the object is marked by affixation on every transitive verb, and the
subject is only marked, in the form of the Imperative suffix, once:

marking system (see Section 16.1), a split-ergative system in which an intransitive verb
marks a third person subject using an object prefix, and an invariant prefix e- appears in
the subject prefix slot (first and second person subjects, and marking of transitive verbs,
are unaffected). The next example illustrates this. The intransitive subject of kiu ÔdieÕ is
marked by an object prefix:

predicates cannot be marked by affixation on coordinate-dependent predicates, but only
on the final, independent, predicate of such chains:

9.7.1 and 9.7.2, and summarised in Section 9.7.3, follow all the rather complex
participant marking phenomena which appear in the many variants of predicate types.
By way of magnification, some more complex examples are shown here. Such
structures as are shown below are by no means uncommon; in fact, they are somewhat
more common than the simple structures by which the basic principles of the system
were elucidated. Basic principles upon which these predicates are affixed are numbered
according to the summary in Section 9.7.3.
The italicised part of the next example is a complex predicate consisting of a serial verb

Negative suffix, but the scope of negation is across the whole predicate, as is normal for
serial verb constructions. Participants are each marked once on the predicate, as per
Principle 1. As this predicate is part of a focus construction (with focus marker fongai)
the subject argument is marked by the Agreement Suffix on the second verb of the
predicate (and on the focus marker), as per Principle 4.

first element of the predicate, the lexical verb:

vofoirene. Because negore ÔfloatÕ is coordinate-dependent and intransitive, it receives
no participant marking (see above, this Section). Voeleile Ôwhen they wereÕ is
subordinate-dependent; its main clause is also that of the verb vofoirene. Voeleile is
intransitive, and is, in this construction, involved in the type of subordination (with the
Potential -le) that requires intransitive subjects to be marked as objects (see above, this
Section). Vofoirene Ôholding themÕ, the main verb on which all these verbs ultimately
2289 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREdepend, is transitive, and thus must mark its object by affixation (as per Principle 2), but

The Agreement Suffix
Throughout this thesis, much mention is made of the Agreement Suffix and its use in
various constructions. It was stated in Chapter 9 that there are two transitive and
intransitive affixial participant marking patterns for basic Lavukaleve clauses. That is,
an intransitive clause may mark its subject participant with either a prefix or a suffix on
the predicate, and a transitive clause may mark its subject and object participants on the
predicate with either two prefixes, or a prefix and a suffix. In the latter case, subject and
object may be marked by either prefix or suffix, as long as each argument is marked
once and only once.
The Agreement Suffix is used as the marker of an argument of a predicate in certain
grammatical environments. These environments are as follows: the Agreement Suffix is
used on the final predicate of a relative clause to mark the head of the relative clause
construction; it is used to mark a certain argument in focus constructions (the choice of
argument is a matter of some importance, see below); and it is used to mark the sole
argument of a stative or resultative intransitive predicate when not in a focus
construction. The Agreement Suffix is also used on adjectives, to express agreement of
the adjective with its head noun.
Rather than discussing the Agreement Suffix per se, in this chapter the kinds of
constructions the Agreement Suffix occurs in are discussed. The functions of the
Agreement Suffix are by no means pragmatically unconnected, and the aim here is to
bring together all of these uses of the Agreement Suffix in one place, to show the
pragmatic functions of this ubiquitous and important suffix in Lavukaleve morphosyntax.
Firstly, the formal features of the Agreement Suffix will be examined. Then the
23110 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXdiscussion will move on to its uses. Its use in relative clauses, focus constructions and
adjectives will be examined in turn, then the discussion moves on to its use with stative
and resultative clauses.
10.1 FORMAL FEATURES
The Agreement Suffix is, strictly speaking, not a single suffix but a paradigm of
suffixes. Its forms mark gender and number, as the following paradigm shows:

-gel-v10.1.1 THE EXISTENCE OF A ZEROThe 3rd singular neuter form is said, throughout this thesis, to be zero, and it is glossed
in example sentences as such. This zero morpheme has not been posited lightly. There
are three good reasons for saying that Lavukaleve has a zero morpheme for its 3rd
singular neuter Agreement Suffix form. Firstly, although there is no direct evidence of
the 3rd singular neuter Agreement Suffix form, it can be demonstrated that it alternates
with the other forms of the Agreement Suffix. Consider for example the following data
(it is elicited, because minimal trios tend not to occur naturally). The Agreement Suffix
is glossed throughout this chapter in bold:

e1 009b/2In the first example of the above trio, the masculine singular Agreement Suffix -m
occurs marking the masculine singular object holu roa Ôa harbourÕ. In the second
example, the feminine singular Agreement Suffix -a occurs marking the feminine
23210 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXsingular object solo la Ôthe mountainÕ. In the third example, there is no overt marking on
the verb for the singular neuter object fagi ga Ôthe islandÕ. However, by comparison
with the other sentences, one could say there is a zero morpheme there (as the gloss
indicates).
The second reason for positing a zero morpheme here is that when sentence-final focus
markers such as those in the above sentences occur after a verb, the verb must appear
with the Agreement Suffix. This is one of the rules of Lavukaleve (see Chapter 11, and
the discussion below). If one says that there is no 3rd singular neuter Agreement Suffix,
then one is forced to change the rule of the verb morphology in focus constructions to
make an exception for 3rd singular neuter arguments. This is a descriptively
unappealing analysis.
The third reason for positing a zero morpheme is that in Lavukaleve, it is obligatory for
all transitive predicates to mark their objects. (This rule was first stated in Section 9.7).
Objects may be marked cross-referenced with a prefix from the object prefix paradigm,
or with the Agreement Suffix. If one said that 3rd singular neuter objects are not crossreferenced with the Agreement Suffix, then one would be forced to amend the rule that
all transitive predicates obligatorily cross-reference their objects, to make an exception
for 3rd singular neuter objects under circumstances where they would be expected to be
marked by the Agreement Suffix (of course, in constructions involving object prefixes,
they still are marked). This again is descriptively unappealing.
Of course, on some level, the 3rd singular neuter Agreement Suffix is just not there. But
in terms of the description of the language, positing a zero in this position simplifies the
analysis and allows more powerful generalisations of processes in Lavukaleve which
probably do have some claim to linguistic reality. For this reason, the 3sgn Agreement
Suffix is considered to be of the form -¿.
Note, however, that it is only posited and glossed in example sentences in circumstances
in which it is certain that another form of the Agreement Suffix would appear. That is, it
is always posited (and glossed) when it is the object of a transitive predicate, or in a
sentence-final focus construction; because the rules of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax mean
that any other form of the Agreement Suffix would appear in those circumstances. But
when a 3rd singular neuter argument is subject of a verb, it is not always certain if the
Agreement Suffix would occur or not, because subject marking is, in many
constructions, not obligatory. In such circumstances, the 3rd singular neuter Agreement
Suffix is not posited and glossed in example sentences.
10.2 THE AGREEMENT SUFFIX IN RELATIVE CLAUSES
The Agreement Suffix is used obligatorily on the final predicate of a relative clause to
cross-reference the head of a relative clause construction. Relative clause constructions
(which are discussed in more detail in Section 16.3) in Lavukaleve are internally23310 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXheaded. That is, the head functions syntactically as part of the relative clause. The
relative clause contains at least one verb, the final one of which is marked with the
verbal Agreement Suffix, plus any full NPs associated with the verb, any adjuncts, and
finally the definite article. Relative clauses can contain quite complex internal
structures, involving subordinate clauses and clause chains for instance (see for example
(6) below, which has a relative clause containing a clause chaining construction). The
final verb in the relative clause receives the Agreement Suffix. The Agreement Suffix
and the definite article agree in number and gender with the head. For example:

Agreement Suffix is followed immediately by the definite article. In all other
construction types, if a verb is followed by the definite article, the verb must have been
23410 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXnominalised, with the Nominaliser suffix (described in Section 13.1). Only in relative
clauses can a non-nominalised verb be followed immediately by the definite article.
Note that relative clauses are nominal modifiers; in this sense, the use of the Agreement
Suffix on relative clauses exactly parallels its use on adjectives (see below), marking the
agreement of the dependent constituent on which it appears with the head of that
constituent.
Note also that in relative clauses and focus constructions, the Agreement Suffix on a
predicate can index an argument in subject, object or postpositional object function. In
all other construction types, the Agreement Suffix on predicates only indexes subjects
or objects. In relative clauses, the Agreement Suffix always indexes the head, and as the
head may be in the syntactic roles of subject, object or postpositional object, the
Agreement Suffix in relative clauses may in fact index arguments in the syntactic role
of object of postposition.
10.3 THE AGREEMENT SUFFIX IN FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
The Agreement Suffix is used to cross-reference a particular argument of a focus
construction. It is shown in Chapter 11 that there are two syntactic types of focus
constructions in Lavukaleve, shown by different agreement patterns of the Agreement
Suffix and focus markers. The Agreement Suffix and the focus marker always agree
with the same entity, and thus always agree with each other. The two syntactic types of
focus, named for the position of the focus marker in the construction, are SentenceInternal focus constructions and Sentence-Final focus constructions. The former is the
construction used to express argument focus; it is not of concern here, as it does not
involve the Agreement Suffix.
Sentence-Final focus constructions with simple verbal or complex predicates do involve
the Agreement Suffix. They consist of a sentence-final focus marker, in construction
with a predicate marked with the Agreement Suffix, and they can be used to express
either sentence focus or predicate focus. Which one of these two types of focus is
intended is shown by the agreement of the Agreement Suffix and focus marker. The
Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with the object of a transitive clause to show
predicate focus; and the subject of a transitive clause, and the subject of an intransitive
clause to show sentence focus.
Predicate focus (Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with object):

object arguments are obligatorily cross-referenced on all transitive verbs. Subject
arguments are not obligatorily expressed, either by overt NP or cross-referencing prefix
(see Section 9.7).

intransitively with no overt morphological affixation to show the change in transitivity.
There are only about a dozen ambitransitive verbs in the corpus. Of these, there are two
kinds. There are those verbs for which the subject of the intransitive form of the verb
corresponds in semantic role to the subject of the transitive form of the verb; and there
are those in which the subject of the intransitive form corresponds to the object of the
transitive form. In Lavukaleve these two types account for about half of the
ambitransitive verbs each. All ambitransitive verbs in the corpus are listed here with
their intransitive and transitive glosses:

semantic correspondences (Ôbe, hangÕ and Ôcome, beginÕ respectively).

vo ÔcomeÕ (intransitive):
3)Iut

youth.group(n)eavo.
e3sgnO-a1sgS-vo
beginI began the youth group.am 093Division of verbs into the two groups above seems to have at least some semantic
motivation. Verbs with more agentive intransitive subjects fall into the S=A group,
whereas verbs with non-agentive intransitive subjects fall into the S=O group. Note that
many motion verbs pattern with S=O verbs, not S=A verbs. This phenomenon is
common in the worldÕs languages.
TWO IRREGULAR VERBS: TUNA ÔBE REALLYÕ AND TAVE ÔBE NOTÕThere are two intransitive verbs which act slightly differently from other intransitive
verbs. The verbs are tuna Ôbe reallyÕ and tave Ôbe notÕ. (Tuna Ôbe reallyÕ is crossclassified as an adjective and a particle). While both tuna and tave are argument-taking
predicates, able to cross-reference their subject arguments with verbal morphology, and,
in the case of tuna, able to take the Negative suffix -la, neither of them can take any
other verbal morphology. Also anomalous is that they can occur immediately following
another intransitive verb, but not obviously in construction with that verb. For instance,
compare examples (4) and (5), which have tuna and tave functioning as normal
453 - WORD C LASSESargument-taking predicates, with examples (6) and (7), which have tuna and tave

because it is not obvious what relationship they have with that verb. These are different
to serial verb constructions in Lavukaleve, because in serial verb constructions in
Lavukaleve, the shared subject is cross-referenced only once on the whole predicate, not
on each verb as here (see Section 14.1). Also, with tave at least, the intransitive verb
which it follows is always from the same semantic type; it is a verb with a modifying
meaning, often a verb that is cross-classified as an adjective (see next section).
There are a few possible analyses. One is that such examples show a unique kind of
serial verb construction, although this is problematic for the reasons given. Another
possibility is that tuna and tave are not verbs in this context, but rather are some unique
word class such as agreement-taking adverbial particles. (Section 3.17.1 below shows
that adverbial particles do not show agreement). The approach taken here is that the
strange behaviour of tuna and tave is a lexical phenomenon, related to their semantic
properties of being frequently appropriate as verbal modifiers, while retaining other
properties associated with intransitive verbs in Lavukaleve.
Such constructions, with two independent predicates occurring next to each other but
not in a serial verb construction and with no overt relationship to each other, only occur
463 - WORD C LASSESwith verbs tave and tuna; in all other cases, clauses in sequence must be overtly marked
for their relationship with each other, either as subordinate-dependent or coordinatedependent or coordinated independent clauses.
3.3 ADJECTIVES
There are only around fifty adjectives in the corpus. There are doubtless more adjectives
than this in the language, but it is nonetheless significant that such a small number have
been found so far. In many of LavukaleveÕs Oceanic neighbours, it is often a difficult
matter to tell whether a particular word is an adjective or an intransitive verb. This
situation also occurs in Lavukaleve; they usually appear in the same position in the
sentence, and even though intransitive verbs have far more morphological possibilities
than adjectives, they often do not avail themselves of them and in fact usually only
appear with the Agreement Suffix, as do adjectives. Predicative adjectives are
impossible to distinguish from intransitive verbs. However attributive adjectives, as a
syntactic class, do occur, and can be easily described by their syntactic and
morphological features:
·
·
·they occur inside an NP (after the noun, before the definite article, if there is one)
modifying a head noun
they have no inherent gender or number, but agree in gender and number with their
head noun, using the Agreement Suffix paradigm also used by verbs
the only morphology they can receive is the Agreement SuffixIf a word has these features, it is called an adjective. Many adjectives can also appear
predicatively; in these circumstances they are indistinguishable from intransitive verbs.
For example, compare the following uses of ho'bea ÔgoodÕ. In the first example, ho'bea
is used attributively, modifying its head noun mina, and occurring inside the NP
between the head noun and the definite article. In the second example, ho'bea is used
predicatively. It is not possible to tell if it is an intransitive verb, or a non-verbal
predicate, with ellipsed head noun:

mark their subject using the Agreement Suffix (see Section 10.5); therefore473 - WORD C LASSESstative/resultative intransitive verbs often appear with the same morphology as
adjectives. If a word can be used as a nominal modifier inside an NP, with the abovementioned other characteristics, it is an adjective. Each such lexical item may have
another, predicative, function, although many do not. If it does, it is considered to be
cross-classified as a verb. Unfortunately, for many of the adjectives listed below the
corpus is not sufficient to show whether, as well as being used attributively, they can be
used predicatively. This area awaits more detailed examination in the future.
Numbers form a subclass of adjectives. They donÕt have inherent gender, they occur in
an attributive relationship with nouns, but they can take, in addition to agreement
morphology (which is only available to ÔoneÕ and ÔtwoÕ), morphology deriving ordinal
forms. Some of them can also take morphology deriving higher-number forms. These
are discussed separately below.
Because there are relatively few adjectives in Lavukaleve, it is worthwhile to list them
exhaustively. Their categorisation is similar to DixonÕs (1982) discussion of semantic
types of adjectives.

Focus constructions
11.1 INTRODUCTION
There are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, functioning in a grammaticalised focus
system, which is a very prominent part of the language. Syntactically the focus markers
are independent words which occur in construction with the constituent immediately to
their left. This is often an NP, but can also be an adjunct, a dependent clause, a predicate
and its object or an entire sentence.
There are two constructions in which the focus markers take part: a Sentence-Final focus
construction, in which the focus marker is in construction with a predicate plus its object
or a sentence, and appears at the end of the sentence; and a Sentence-Internal focus
construction, in which the focus marker is in construction with a non-predicating
constituent, and appears sentence-internally. The focus marker expresses focus on the
constituent with which it is in construction. So Sentence-Final focus markers express
focus on either a sentence or a predicate plus its object; and Sentence-Internal focus
markers express focus on an argument, an adjunct, a non-main verb, and the first part of
a complex predicate. Constructions involving focus markers are extremely common in
Lavukaleve; focus markers occur in approximately 35% of all sentences in the corpus.
This chapter describes the morphological and syntactic features of the focus markers, the
syntactic constructions which they occur in, and the pragmatic functions of these
constructions. Section 11.2 describes the forms and syntax of the focus markers
themselves. The major part of the chapter (Section 11.3) describes the constructions in
which the focus markers occur. Section 11.3.2 describes in detail Sentence-Final focus
constructions. Section 11.3.3 describes Sentence-Internal focus constructions. Section
11.5 discusses those situations in which there is more than one focus marker in one
24711 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSsentence. Section 11.6.1 describes those situations in which there is no marked focus.
Section 11.6.2 shows that the focus markers are not copulas, although they share certain
functions which copulas have in some languages. Section 11.6.4 notes the functional
similarity between Lavukaleve focus constructions and English accent prosody. While the
beginning of Section 11.2 gives a brief outline of the difference between each of the three
focus markers, Section 11.7 describes each of them in detail. Section 11.8 is a brief
summary of the main features of the focus system in Lavukaleve.
Throughout this chapter I use the term ÔconstructionÕ in the sense of the correspondence
between a morpho-syntactic structure and its pragmatic/semantic functions. So Ôfocus
constructionsÕ are those constructions which have a particular morpho-syntactic structure,
and express a particular pragmatic meaning.
11.2 MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX OF THE FOCUS MARKERS
The focus markers are independent words which form their own word class. The three
focus markers each form a paradigm of suppletive forms marked for person, gender and
number. The three different focus markers are meo, heo and feo (cited throughout in
their 3rd person singular feminine form). Each one is used for a different sentence type.
Meo is used in polar questions. Heo is used in certain syntactic environments such as
information questions, or where there is a demonstrative pronoun foia in the clause, or as
the second focus marker in a focus-echo construction. Heo can also be used to express
strong emphasis; this use of heo rather than feo or meo is not obligatory (unlike the
others), but a pragmatic choice made by a speaker for a certain effect. The third focus
marker, feo, is the unmarked one; it has the widest distribution and the least constraints
on its use. It is used in all situations where grammatical focus is to be expressed, apart
from those using heo or meo. In this sense, feo can be viewed as the default focus
marker.
11.2.1 PARADIGMS OF THE FOCUS MARKERSThese three paradigms are identical but for the initial consonant:

The first and second person forms of these paradigms show close formal similarity with
the free pronouns, consisting of C(o) plus the pronoun form. There is also a slightly less
strong formal relationship with the demonstratives. See Sections 8.4.1, 8.5 and 8.7.1 for
the paradigms. Note also that, as well as having a formal relationship with
demonstratives, the focus markers have a certain functional overlap with them in some
contexts; this is discussed in Section 11.4.2.
11.2.2 SYNTACTIC STATUSThe focus markers occur following and in construction with predicates plus their objects,
sentences, and non-predicating constituents. In the first example below, a focus marker is
in construction with the second NP of a non-verbal clause, in the second with a temporal
adjunct, in the third with a non-main verb (in this case a coordinate-dependent verb in a
clause chain) and in the fourth with an intransitive predicate. Throughout this chapter the
focussed constituents are italicised in the Lavukaleve; and in the English translation the
focussed element is in bold; the rest of this chapter justifies the claims implicit in this.

sentence. This kind of construction is only possible for at most one core argument, and (it
seems) any number of adjuncts or non-main verbs.
In Lavukaleve, then, it is possible to pile up focussed element after focussed element. In
languages with grammatical focus marking, it is common for only one instance of this to
be allowed per sentence. Lambrecht (1994: 237-8) notes that English does not allow more
than one grammatically focus-marked (i.e. clefted) element in a sentence. There is a basic
principle which many languages follow, which limits the amount of focussed information
which can appear in one sentence. Giv—n (1975) argues, from comparison of focus
constructions in Bemba, Rwanda and Zulu, that Òthere exists a strategy of information
processing in language such that the amount of new information per a certain unit of
27811 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSmessage-transaction is restricted in a fashion Ñ say Ôone unit per propositionÕ Ó (p. 202,
his emphasis). Pawley and Syder (1977; 1983) make a similar point with their Òoneclause-at-a-timeÓ hypothesis. Du Bois (1987: 826), on this topic, formulates a ÒOne New
Argument constraintÓ, which says that speakers prefer to introduce a maximum of one
new argument per clause. He explains this in terms of a processing limitation: ÒNew
(previously inactive) information appears to be more difficult to process, and hence most
subject to constraintÓ (Du Bois 1987: 846).
However languages with focus marked by accent prosody generally tend to allow more
than one focussed item per sentence, but still only one per intonation unit. ChafeÕs (1987:
31-32; 1994) proposal of a Òone new concept at a time constraintÓ, specifies that only one
piece of new information occurs within one intonation unit, not within one clause or
proposition or sentence. English, for instance, does allow more than one focussed
element marked by pitch accent per sentence, but only one per intonation unit (Chafe
1994: 108-119).
The issue revolves around what a language takes as the relevant domain for the purposes
of focus marking. For English, the relevant domain over which focus marking by
prosody can apply is the intonation unit; whereas the domain over which grammatical
focus marking by clefts can apply is the sentence. For Lavukaleve, the relevant domain
over which grammatical focus marking can apply is not one sentence; there is no
constraint that only one element can be focussed per sentence. Instead, the rule seems to
be that only one core NP, plus any number of adjuncts, can receive argument focus per
sentence.
This is not a unique feature of Lavukaleve. Some other languages which have
grammaticalised focus marking allow more than instance of focus per sentence. For
instance Yukagir marks focus of a core argument by suffixation on the verb and the
relevant NP (Fortescue 1996). It also marks focus on adjuncts by postposing the adjunct.
It is possible to have focus on both a core argument and an adjunct in the same sentence,
using both the suffixation and postposing methods. It is not, however, possible, to focus
on two core arguments in one sentence, or, as I understand it, on two adjuncts in one
sentence. Yukagir is slightly different from Lavukaleve in that it uses two entirely
different strategies to mark different kinds of focus in one sentence, but nonetheless the
pragmatic fact of multiple-focus marking is comparable to Lavukaleve.
Roviana, an Oceanic language spoken on islands adjacent to the Russells, marks focus
using a special set of focal pronouns (Corston 1996). These have not been described in
detail, and it is not completely certain from the description that they are indeed marking
focus rather than, say, emphasis, but there are examples in CorstonÕs work of more than
one of these being used, with different reference, within a single sentence. If they are
focus pronouns then they are an example from a language close to Lavukaleve of
multiple-focus marking in one sentence.","[303, 304, 305]"
"In Lavukaleve, the situation is similar to this. One could think of the deictic as the head,
29111 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSthe form of which determines the agreement of the focus marker. An f-stem deictic head
(pronoun foia) requires an h-stem focus marker (heo). An h-stem deictic head (hoia)
allows an f-stem focus marker (feo). This is alliterative discord in the sense that the
agreement markers, f and h, occur on both of the word classes concerned; as markers of
agreement. Concord implies identity; these markers however, agree, as it were, by
disagreeing. This, then, is alliterative discord.
There is also an interaction between f and h within the focus markers; recall that if there
are two focus markers in construction with each other (i.e. in focus-echo constructions),
the first may be either feo or heo, but the second must be heo, not feo. The interaction
between f/h stems in focus markers is somewhat different from the f/h interaction between
deictics and focus markers. With focus markers, the interaction between f- and h-stems is
due to a cumulative effect of a combination between emphasis and focus, and arises as a
corollary of the respective functions of the f-stem and h-stem focus markers.
THE FEO FOCUS MARKERFeo is the ÒelsewhereÓ focus marker; that is, it is used in all contexts where a focus
marker is needed but the conditions are not appropriate for meo or heo. It is used in
statements, not in questions, and in clauses in which there is no foia demonstrative
pronoun, and where there is no strong emphasis. Examples have occurred frequently
throughout this chapter, and more need not be repeated here.
11.8 SUMMARY
There are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, which are used in different constructions.
The constituent with which the focus marker is in construction is the focussed constituent.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate plus its object, a
sentence, an NP or an adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles, non-main
verbs and the first part of complex predicates.
When predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence; thus, these constructions are called Sentence-Final focus constructions. The
agreement of the focus marker determines the domain of focus, thus sentence focus and
predicate focus are distinguished by the agreement shown on the focus marker.
When arguments are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,
sentence-internally; thus the constructions are called Sentence-Internal focus
constructions.
As a point of embarkation, LambrechtÕs definition of focus was used; he regards focus as
a scope indicator, related to phenomena of assertion and presupposition. LavukaleveÕs
use of focus differs in some respects from many other languages, for example in its
29211 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSfrequent focus-marking of dependent clauses, but it was pointed out that since Lavukaleve
so clearly marks what is and what is not focussed, it is no difficult matter to determine
what is focussed in Lavukaleve; and thus an understanding of the pragmatics of focus
marking in Lavukaleve can be arrived at empirically.
It was also shown how LavukaleveÕs focus marking system grammaticalises LambrechtÕs
three-way division of focus into sentence, predicate and argument focus in an extremely
clear way; in fact, Lavukaleve is a better exemplar of his three-way division than English
or the other languages he uses.
Some aspects of LavukaleveÕs focus marking system are highly unusual. For instance it is
unusual for a focus marker to show agreement, and to be so heavily grammaticalised as
LavukaleveÕs obviously is. Further, it is impossible to describe the basic morpho-syntax
of Lavukaleve without having recourse to information structure. This is not uncommon in
languages; what is uncommon is the extent to which the categories of information
structure pervade LavukaleveÕs grammar.","[317, 318, 319]"
"33013 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONverb, but it has certain semantic effects. For action verbs, it gives the verb an iterative
meaning, indicating that the action of the verb is repeated over and over. For example
compare, hului ÔturnÕ with huluia Ôgo all round, turn roundÕ; kelago Ôgo overÕ with
kelagoa Ôgo from side to sideÕ.
Verbs referring to states undergo a slightly different semantic change when they suffix -a.
The semantic effect is not iterativeness, but rather the meaning of the verb seems to be
intensified. For example, compare mutate Ôbe heavyÕ with mutatea Ôbe really heavyÕ;
raravu Ôbe redÕ with raravua Ôbe red all overÕ. One stative verb kele Ôbe whiteÕ
becomes kelea Ôbecome whiteÕ, and kiu ÔdieÕ becomes kiua ÔfightÕ.
One further intransitive verb ririgoi ÔprepareÕ has, as far as can be ascertained, the same
meaning when it is suffixed with -a.
The suffix -a, although it has different uses on transitive versus intransitive verbs, seems
to have a common functional core. On transitive verbs its function is to reduce the
syntactic transitivity of the verb on which it appears. Its function with intransitive verbs,
at least in its iterative use, is to reduce the semantic transitivity of the verb, in Hopper and
ThompsonÕs (1980) terms. In its intensifying use however this seems not to be the case.
13.3.3 IMPERSONAL CONSTRUCTIONSImpersonal constructions involve transitive verbs which have no object cross-referencing.
They are in fact the only construction type in the language in which a transitive verb fails
to receive object indexing; and it is by this feature that they can be distinguished from all
other construction types. Impersonal constructions are a unique morphological pattern
which is sufficient to demonstrate constructionhood. In particular, there are verbs which
are otherwise solely transitive (i.e. not ambitransitive) which in this one function appear
with a single argument. The patient, which one would expect to be the object, is
expressed as a subject, and the agent, which one would expect to be the subject, is not
expressed. The construction is used to avoid mentioning an agent of a verb. The agents of
verbs in such constructions are almost always magical beings. There is no cultural or
linguistic restriction on talking about magical beings, but often people prefer not to spell
such things out in so many words. The Impersonal construction provides a mechanism
for talking about such things without having to be explicit.
These Impersonal constructions are valency reducing constructions, in that a normally
transitive verb is morphologically intransitive. One would not want to say that the verbs
involved are ambitransitive, because there is always a strongly implied notion of an agent
as well as a patient. There are ambitransitive verbs in the language, but these are not
examples of them (see Section 3.2.3 for a discussion of ambitransitive verbs). Rather,
one could think of these constructions as being pragmatically similar to passive
constructions. They are not passives, because there is no overt morphology to signal the
construction (cf. Dixon 1994: 146), and because if one was to include the agent in the
33113 - WORD-LEVEL DERIVATIONconstruction, one would end up with a normal transitive clause; the Impersonal
construction would cease to exist.
Importantly, these Impersonal constructions are used specifically to hint that there is an
unstated agent involved in the action. A speaker could omit the overt NP and subject
indexing referring to the agent. This is common for when an agent is well-known or
uninteresting. Recall that in many constructions in Lavukaleve it is only obligatory to
index objects; subject indexing may be freely omitted, and very often is. But the
pragmatic force of an Impersonal construction is different from simple omission; it flags
the existence of the subject by its very absence. The following examples compare normal
transitive and Impersonal uses of certain verbs.

which, when suffixed to a transitive verb, reduces the surface valency of the verb to one,
and indicates that the dual or plural agent and patient of the verb are acting on each other.
Verbs suffixed with -ria are reduplicated, unless their stem is longer than two syllables,
in which case reduplication is not obligatory for them. Principles of reduplication are
discussed in Section 2.9.1.
For example, compare the reciprocal verb nunumaria Ôchoose each otherÕ with transitive

not involve valency changing at all. Reflexive constructions are formed using the word
muan ÔselfÕ. Muan is described in Section 3.15, where it is explained that it forms its
own word class. It is obligatorily prefixed with a Possessive prefix, and it can also be
preceded by an NP referring to the same entity as the Possessive prefix. This NP controls
verbal cross-referencing; muan is not a noun, so it does not function as an argument, and
therefore does not control verbal cross-referencing.
This word muan ÔselfÕ is also used non-reflexively to emphasis a particular actor, or to
stress that an actor did the event by themselves.
An example of muan ÔselfÕ used in a purely reflexive sense follows. Note the 1st singular
subject and 1st singular object prefixes (on the Habitual Auxiliary and the main verb l e
ÔseeÕ respectively):

having the same actor as both subject and object, constructions such as the following are
generally preferred:

There is an unproductive construction in Lavukaleve involving only four intransitive
verbs feu Ôgo upÕ; hau Ôgo in, go shorewardsÕ; vau Ôgo out, go seawardsÕ and v o
ÔcomeÕ. In this construction, the subjects of these verbs are indexed using prefixes from
the Possessive prefix paradigm, not from the subject prefix paradigm2 . There is a stress
shift rule which moves the stress of the verb from the verb stem to the Possessive prefix.
The verbs also receive a special suffix -i~-e. The verbs marked in this way function as
normal simple predicates; the construction does not change the syntactic function of the
verbs themselves. The construction is a stylistic variant of the regular forms. These verbs
can, and normally do, also appear in their regular form, indexing their subjects with
subject prefixes. Some examples of Possessor-subject constructions:

verbal morphology. It could be thought of as a unique member of a subclass of verbs,
but because of its very different behaviour from verbs I prefer to put it in a class of its
own.
The form and functions of the Habitual Auxiliary are discussed in Section 14.3.
3.9 POSTPOSITIONS
Postpositions are a small class of words. Their defining features are:
·
·
·they occur as the final element of a postpositional phrase
they obligatorily cross-reference their head noun with an object prefix
they take no further morphologyThe postpositions are:
na
nam
namula
hamail

ne
ku
keleiin, on, etc.
to, from

nearThe last postposition, kelei ÔnearÕ, belongs in its own subclass as, unlike the others, it
can occur with the Locative suffix. Postpositions and postpositional phrases are
discussed in Section 7.1. Note there is a conjunction ne ÔandÕ, formally identical to ne
ÔwithÕ (see Section 3.10).
3.10 CONJUNCTIONS
There are seven conjunctions in Lavukaleve: aka Ôand, so thenÕ; taman ÔhoweverÕ; leta
ÔbutÕ; o Ôand, orÕ; olang ÔbecauseÕ; ve ÔorÕ; ne ÔandÕ. The last can also function as a
postposition. Conjunctions share the following features:
573 - WORD C LASSES·
·they occur in between a pair of coordinated clauses or NPs
apart from aka, which can take the Presentative suffix -ri and Predicative -o/om/v,
they cannot take any morphological affixationThe use of conjunctions in conjoined clauses is mentioned in Section 15.4.6 and
discussed in Section 18.1.3. The Presentative and Predicative suffixes, and aka, are
discussed in Sections 8.9.4 and 8.10.3.
3.11 LOCATIONALS
Locationals are a loose, heterogeneous class of words that include the hoka ÔhereÕ
paradigm (including hoka ÔhereÕ; hoika Ôthere, medial; heaka Ôthere, distantÕ; hoaka
Ôthere; unspecified distanceÕ); ika ÔthereÕ, and koka~oka ÔfarÕ, all of which take
Presentative suffix -ri and Predicative -o/om/v, plus a number of other single
uninflecting words including uke ÔnearÕ; umu Ôunder, belowÕ; vuli ÔbehindÕ; fain Ôon
topÕ; fafaril ÔacrossÕ; sangine ÔtogetherÕ.
These words are grouped together not on morphological grounds; indeed they are
morphologically very varied. Rather they are grouped together on the semantic basis
that they provide locational specification to a clause. They function as adjuncts, having
scope over a whole clause. Some of these words can take the Presentative -ri,
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la. Their classification as locationals recognises the
fact that they form a semantic class. In strictly formal terms, different classes could be
recognised, based on whether or not they take either the Presentative -ri and Predicative
suffix -o/om/v (hoka, hoika, heaka, hoaka, aka, ika, koka and oka) and Extended -la
(the same group but without hoaka and aka). Those that do not would then be classified
as particles. However it seems descriptively more revealing to think about them in terms
of their semantic relationship to each other. In this way, members of the same semantic
set like uke ÔnearÕ (uninflecting) and koka~oka ÔfarÕ (taking Presentative -ri and
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la) do not have to be separated.
Those locationals which end in k a enter into certain formal and paradigmatic
relationships with each other, and with the demonstratives; these forms are discussed in
Sections 8.9 and 8.10, where there is also a discussion of the Presentative -ri and
Predicative -o/om/v and Extended -la.
3.12 NUN ÔFROMÕ
Nun ÔfromÕ is a locational particle which differs from the other locationals in that it
always occurs together with a nominal adjunct, immediately following it, and together
with this nominal adjunct it forms a complex locational adjunct. Nun is discussed in
Section 7.4.
583 - WORD C LASSES3.13 DEMONSTRATIVE IDENTIFIERS
There is a class of words which are formally related to the foia demonstrative pronoun,
with the addition of an extra syllable /hV/ after the first syllable of the pronoun, where
V takes its form from the vowel of the first syllable of the pronoun.
Demonstrative identifiers only occur in non-verbal clauses, functioning somewhat
similarly to predicative deictics. See Section 8.11 for a discussion of them, and a
comparison with predicative deictics.
3.14 ROI ~DOI ÔWHICH?Õ
There is a word roi~doi Ôwhich?Õ (the forms vary freely; see Section 2.10), a question
word, which forms its own word class, on the basis of its morpho-syntactic properties. It
functions as the head of an NP, so one might want to call it a noun, but there are two
reasons that this is not an appropriate classification. Firstly, it is a criterial feature of
nouns that they have their own inherent gender. Roi does not, but instead takes its
gender from the word whose status it is questioning. Secondly, it can appear in an NP in
apposition with, and before, this noun which it is questioning. Nouns do not do this; two
nouns in the same NP must normally appear in a head-modifier relationship, using the
possessive construction (see Section 4.2 for discussion of this). The fact that roi can
appear in apposition with a noun means that it is not a noun. The fact that it appears
before, not after, this noun, means that it could not possibly be modifying this noun;
modifiers invariably follow, not precede, their heads. For these reasons, roi is not
considered a noun or an adjective, but instead is considered to belong to its own word
class.
Other question words are discussed below, Section 3.17.2. Roi is discussed further,
along with other question words, in Section 17.1.4.
3.15 REFLEXIVE MUAN ÔSELF Õ
The reflexive word muan ÔselfÕ is in its own word class, as it has features unique to it. It
is obligatorily prefixed with a Possessive prefix, to indicate its referent. It may also be
preceded by an NP stating this referent. Verbal morphology cross-references the NP (or
the referent to which the Possessive prefix refers), not muan itself. Muan is not a noun,
as it has no gender, and does not function as the head of an NP, cannot be modified by a
demonstrative and cannot take the definite article, does not function as an argument, and
therefore it cannot be cross-referenced by a predicate. Muan is called a reflexive word,
because one of its functions is reflexive, but it also occurs to indicate that the actor did
the action alone, by themselves. In the following example, muan appears with a 1st
person singular Possessive prefix, and an NP consisting of the 1st person pronoun
593 - WORD C LASSESprecedes it. The verb cross-references the 1st singular subject:

3.16 VERB ADJUNCTS
There is a small closed class of verb adjuncts, consisting of only four words: fo'for Ôfly,
prepareÕ; ko'kor ÔtightÕ; so'sor ÔfastÕ and va'var ÔtalkingÕ.
Verb adjuncts only occur in construction with the verb hai ÔdoÕ; together the words
form a kind of complex predicate. They immediately precede hai. Nothing can
intervene between the verb adjunct and hai, and the verb adjunct cannot occur with any
other verb than hai.
It is easy to distinguish verb adjuncts from other word classes. They are not nominal
arguments, because they are never, under any circumstance, cross-referenced by the
verb. They are not verbs, because they never receive any verbal morphology; and in
addition, verbs are all vowel-final. They are different from particles, both in their fixed
position and in their reliance on the presence of hai ÔdoÕ. It is interesting to note the
formal relationship between the four verb adjuncts: they all end in /r/, and they look like
older reduplications; the non-initial stress pattern is also suggestive of this (see Section
2.7.1 for a discussion of the types of words which have non-initial stress). If they are old
reduplications, it is not at all clear what the unreduplicated words were, or what word
class they were. Interestingly, there is a noun va'var ÔtalkingÕ as well.
Note that borrowed verbs also function similarly to verb adjuncts, but in construction
with sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ rather than with hai. Verb adjunct constructions are
discussed in Section 14.4.
3.17 PARTICLES
There are a large number of particles in Lavukaleve; these words take no morphological
affixation, and do not occur in close construction with any other word or constituent.
They can be divided into smaller subclasses based on their scope across a constituent or
clause, and their semantics. Adverbial particles have scope over a clause or a single
verb. Hesitation and exclamation particles do not have scope. Other particles have scope
603 - WORD C LASSESover a whole clause. They all function syntactically as adjuncts.
3.17.1 A DVERBIAL PARTICLESThere are only ten adverbial particles in the corpus. Most verbal modification is done by
full verbal clauses rather than by adverbs. Adverbs are a subclass of particles which can
have scope over a single verb (although this is not always the case; they can also have
scope over an entire clause). They are all manner adverbs. As there are so few, it is
worth giving an exhaustive list, although there are probably more in the language than
occur in the corpus collected so far.

Adverbial particles generally immediately precede the verb which they modify,
although this is not obligatory. As adverbs are not discussed elsewhere in the thesis, it is
worthwhile to show some examples here:

"543 - WORD C LASSESFoia and oia are both used to make anaphoric reference to a participant in a discourse.
They differ in that foia is used to make anaphoric reference to an activated referent, one
which is uppermost in hearersÕ minds, whereas oia is used to make anaphoric reference
to a semi-activated referent, one which was uppermost in hearersÕ minds until recently.
They are not considered personal pronouns, largely because they make obligatory
reference to distance from the speaker, which is characteristic of demonstrative
pronouns, rather than personal pronouns. A full discussion of these demonstrative
pronouns, including justification of their classification, and explanation of the
difference between them, as well as discussion of the difference between them and the
demonstrative modifier, appears in Chapter 8, where the paradigms of each are
presented.
3.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS
There are first and second person pronouns in Lavukaleve, but no third person pronoun.
The functional domain of third person pronouns is filled by demonstrative pronouns
instead. Argumentation for this division of the deictic paradigms is presented in full in
Chapter 8, where also the paradigm of 1st and 2nd person pronouns is given.
Defining features of personal pronouns are:
·
·
·
·they mark person and number of the referent, and inclusion/exclusion of the
addressee (only in 1st person non-singular forms)
they function as nominal heads
they cannot be modified by adjectives, though they can be modified by the
demonstrative modifier
they take the Group suffixes -ha/-saIt is perhaps worth noting here that there are no indefinite pronouns in Lavukaleve.
Concepts like someone/anyone are expressed using the noun ali ÔmanÕ; no-one is
expressed by the NP malav rovo-ru Ôpeople one.pl-NEG (no people)Õ or ali roa-ru
Ôman one.sgm-NEG (no man)Õ. Concepts like something/anything are expressed by the
noun mina ÔthingÕ; nothing by mina ro-ru Ôthing one.sgf-NEG (not a thing)Õ. Man
ÔwhatÕ, ami ÔwhoÕ, and elahave Ôhow muchÕ, all masculine nouns, can also mean
ÔwhateverÕ, ÔwhoeverÕ and Ôhowever muchÕ respectively. Plural noun elav Ôhow manyÕ
can also mean Ôhowever manyÕ. Roi~doi ÔwhichÕ can also mean ÔwhicheverÕ. Concepts
like somewhere/anywhere/nowhere, somehow/anyhow and so on are expressed as Ôin a
placeÕ, Ôin no placeÕ, Ôin a wayÕ and so on in Lavukaleve. There are no special
expressions for these concepts.
3.6 THE DEFINITE ARTICLE
The definite article consists of a paradigm of inflecting forms which appear with a noun
553 - WORD C LASSESin an NP to mark definiteness. It has the following morphological and syntactic
features:
·
·
·
·it can only occur with a head noun
it is obligatorily inflected for gender and number to agree with its head, and it can
take no further morphological affixation
only one article can occur per NP
when it occurs it is always the final word of the NPThe paradigm for the definite article is given in Section 4.1.2, where there is a
discussion of its morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features.
3.7 THE FOCUS MARKERS
There are three paradigms of focus markers, which are marked for person, gender and
number of a particular element of the constituent with which they are in construction5.
The three stems themselves have different pragmatic meanings as follows: the meo
focus marker is used in polar questions; the heo focus marker is used in information
questions, in clauses containing the demonstrative pronoun foia, and to mark strong
emphasis; and the feo focus marker is used elsewhere, in other contexts in which focus
is marked (the focus markers are cited in their 3rd person singular feminine forms here).
The focus markers have the following features:
·
·
·
·they each form a paradigm marked for person, gender and number and they can take
no further morphological affixation
they do not function as the head of a clause; that is, they have no arguments of their
own
they can occur in construction with NPs, adjuncts, verbs or entire sentences
they are always constituent-finalThe syntactic, morphological and pragmatic functions of the focus markers are
discussed in Chapter 11. The paradigms are given in that chapter.
3.8 THE HABITUAL AUXILIARY
The Habitual Auxiliary is a stem me. It is defined as its own word class on the
following grounds:
·
·5it forms the second part of a complex predicate, in construction with a verb
it cross-references the subject of the predicate of which it forms a part, using eitherWhat the focus marker agrees with is a matter of some complexity, which is dealt with in Chapter 11.","[80, 81, 82]"
"364CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Clause chaining
15.1 INTRODUCTION
Clause chaining constructions consist of a string of coordinate-dependent clauses
followed by a final independent clause. This chapter describes in detail the morphology
and syntax of coordinate-dependent clauses, and shows that they can be clearly
distinguished from subordinate clauses and independent coordinate clauses. Clause
chaining constructions in other Papuan languages are examined briefly to see how
LavukaleveÕs constructions compare with those already known in the literature.
15.2 INDEPENDENT, SUBORDINATE-DEPENDENT AND COORDINATE -DEPENDENT CLAUSES
REVISITEDIt was explained in Section 9.5 that there are two main types of clauses in Lavukaleve:
independent (main) clauses and dependent clauses. There are, in turn, two types of
dependent clauses: subordinate-dependent and coordinate-dependent clauses. This
terminology is used by Foley (1986) in describing typical clause structures of Papuan
languages. It is particularly revealing for Lavukaleve: in Lavukaleve there are clear
morpho-syntactic distinctions between each of these clause types, and it is descriptively
useful to consider them each separately. Main (independent) clauses were described in
Chapter 9. Subordinate-dependent clauses are described in Chapter 16. This chapter is
devoted to the description of the other major clause type: coordinate-dependent clauses.
Coordinate-dependent clauses are, as their name suggests, dependent on a main
(independent) predicate. They share this property with subordinate clauses, but the kind
of dependence which they display is very different in the two cases. It was explained in
36515 - CLAUSE C HAININGSection 9.5 that main clauses are syntactically and morphologically independent; they
can occur as single utterances on their own, and do not depend on any other clause for
the expression of TAM and participant marking. The words ÔmainÕ and ÔindependentÕ
are used interchangeably to name this kind of clause. Dependent clauses, on the other
hand, cannot occur on their own, but rather occur in construction with another clause.
They rely on this other clause for the expression of certain TAM and participant
marking properties.
Subordinate-dependent clauses cross-reference their own arguments, but they can only
specify their TAM properties in a very restricted way; essentially, they are only marked
for their semantic relationship to their main predicate. Subordinate-dependent clauses
are embedded within a main clause; they function as modifiers of particular parts of the
main clause (i.e. they are relative clauses, adverbial clauses and purposive clauses); as
Foley (1986) points out, they have a part-whole relationship with the main clause.
Crucially, they allow subject cross-referencing, whereas coordinate-dependent clauses
do not. A discussion of the difference between subordinate-dependent and coordinatedependent clauses (and serial verb constructions) appears later on in this chapter.
Coordinate-dependent clauses are syntactically and semantically dependent on a main
clause, but are not syntactically or semantically a part of that clause. Instead, they are
linked to the main clause Òin a linear string, much like beads on a necklaceÓ (Foley
1986: 177). In Lavukaleve they cannot cross-reference their subject arguments. Also,
they cannot mark their own TAM; they rely on the main clause for this. However they
do carry morphology specifying their temporal relationship with the main clause. In
fact, the only morphology (apart from the Causative suffix) available to a coordinatedependent predicate is an object prefix, if the predicate is transitive, and a suffix
marking the temporal relationship of the coordinate-dependent clause with the next
clause.
Note that because coordinate-dependent clauses are marked by verbal morphology, it is
not possible to have non-verbal predicates entering into clause chaining constructions.
Coordinate-dependent clauses are always verbal.
15.3 OVERVIEW
As a starting point for the discussion, consider the following excerpt from a text. The
story is a procedural text explaining how the speaker gathers and cooks taalea, a kind of
shellfish. It consists of a sequence of sentences, each one involving a clause chaining
construction. Coordinate-dependent predicates are italicised; the independent final
predicates of the chain are underlined.","[390, 391, 392]"

oiva8.7.2 FUNCTIONSOia is another demonstrative pronoun, with much more restricted circumstances of use
than the more general foia. It is used only for tracking (making reference to usually
major participants in order to keep track of them throughout a narrative). But within this
general tracking function, oia has a specific domain of usage. It is used to refer to an
entity who is not the most activated one at the moment of speech. In practice, this
means that someone who was in the conversation some short time ago will be referred
to using oia, to mean Ôthe one who I talked about beforeÕ. In narratives, oia is used most
commonly to reactivate a non-activated participant.
In this description, ChafeÕs (1987; 1994, especially pp. 53-56 and Chapter 6) notion of
activation is used2. He distinguishes between three levels of activation. That is, out of
all the many concepts people have in their minds at any one time,
[a]n active concept is one that is currently lit up, a concept in a personÕs focus of
consciousness. A semi-active concept is one that is in a personÕs peripheral
consciousness, a concept of which a person has a background awareness, but which is
not being directly focused on. An inactive concept is one that is currently in a personÕs
long-term memory, neither focally nor peripherally active. (1987: 25)Activation is a matter of degree. An entity, once active, gradually loses its active status
over time. Lavukaleve neatly encapsulates the degree of activatedness of a pronoun1The terms ÔProximalÕ and ÔMedialÕ are not so immediately relevant for the oia demonstrative, but are
retained because of morphological parallels with the foia and hoia demonstratives.","[194, 195]"

MOD.PROX.sgm Lavukaleve 3sgnFOCI said this (m) in Lavukaleve2.rk2 015This anomalous situation presents a clash between two competing principles in
Lavukaleve. The first principle is that all transitive verbs must be cross-referenced for
their objects. The second principle is that all sentence-final focus constructions like this
one require an argument to be cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix on the verbal
element before the focus marker (see Chapter 11). Normally these principles do not
collide, because normally in single-word predicates either subject or object can be
marked at either end of the verb, by either prefix or suffix. So it is possible always to
choose to mark the one required by the focus construction by the Agreement Suffix, and
to mark the other one by a prefix. However, in verbal complexes, marking of subject
and object occurs in a fixed position. The object must be marked on the verb, and
subject must be marked on the Habitual Auxiliary. Now, because the focus construction
requires the object to be cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix, a morphological
dilemma arises. The language must either violate its rule of marking object on the verb
and subject on the auxiliary, or violate its rule of only marking each argument once per
predicate. The latter alternative is apparently preferable. In only this circumstance can it
mark the same argument more than once within the one predicate (although note that
there is somewhat of a similar situation in certain types of relative clauses: see Section
16.3).
The same anomaly also comes about when a speaker wants to use a prefix to crossreference the subject on the auxiliary, but also wants to use a focus construction
requiring cross-referencing of that subject: the result is that the subject gets crossreferenced twice on the auxiliary:

"1286 - GENDER AND AGREEMENT
HOMONYMSThere are many homonyms in Lavukaleve, and it is interesting to note that in some
cases they take the same gender, but in other cases their genders differ. Thus:

genders. This is natural; some of these words are clearly chance homonyms, whereas
others are really the same word. So for example hai meaning Ôpoint, promontoryÕ is
probably the same word as hai meaning ÔforeheadÕ, and they have the same gender; but
probably kala meaning ÔmotherÕ is a chance homonym with kala meaning ÔcollarboneÕ,
and they have different genders.
E XPLOITATION OF GENDER FOR SEMANTIC PURPOSESIn most cases, gender is a fixed feature of a noun, but it is possible in Lavukaleve,
though rare, for the gender of a noun to be changed for semantic purposes. There are a
few instances in the corpus of a masculine or neuter noun being treated as a feminine
noun, to express the fact that it is very small. Consider the following examples:

as it normally does. However in the second example, foe is feminine. This is a device
deliberately exploited by the speaker for a particular semantic purpose. The speaker has
just asked the evil giant if he could use the giantÕs fire. He wants to cook a pig he has
just caught, but he doesnÕt want to tell the giant that, because he knows the giant will
take the pig from him if he knows about it. He is eventually forced to admit to the giant
that he wants the fire to cook the pig on it, but he tries to claim that the pig is only very
small, and thus not worth the giantÕs attention. To emphasise the tiny size of the pig, the
speaker uses feminine agreement instead of the usual masculine. The next pair of
examples shows a similar situation:

co 016The first of the above examples shows mola ÔcanoeÕ acting in its normal way as a
neuter noun, taking neuter agreement. In the second example, however, it takes
feminine agreement. The speaker deliberately uses feminine agreement to emphasise the
smallness of the canoe in this situation. It is not possible treat a non-masculine or nonneuter noun as masculine or neuter to make a particular point; nor indeed is it clear what
the point made could be.
Note that it is not obvious from the corpus of feminine nouns that small things are
associated with feminine gender, but the above examples do show this association being
made morphologically, even if it is not clear in the lexicon of the language.
6.2 AGREEMENT
Gender is expressed in Lavukaleve primarily through agreement, not through the form
of the noun itself, despite the importance of phonological form of the noun for gender
assignment. Almost all nominal modifiers agree with their head nouns; that is, the
definite article, adjectives, demonstrative modifiers and the focus markers. Also
demonstrative pronouns show gender agreement. Further, some elements agree with
1306 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTnouns across the clause. Verbal prefixes which cross-reference objects (but not those
which cross-reference subjects) show gender agreement, as does the verbal Agreement
Suffix. Actually, all these elements show not just gender but also number agreement.
For most forms, gender and number are expressed together in portmanteau morphemes.
An example of this concordance shown in different word classes throughout the
sentence:
5)airaol
le'laol
airaol

feol
ruia
-ol
feol
old.woman -du.f 3dufFOC...two old women live there.leiaol.
lei
-aol
exist -du.f
co 033Throughout the language, however, all gender distinctions are shown only in the
singular and dual numbers; plural forms never express gender. This is true not just of
morphological affixes and grammatical words, but also of many lexical items (e.g.
vo'vou Ôboy childÕ, vo'voul Ôtwo boysÕ; vo'vo Ôgirl childÕ, vo'vol Ôtwo girls; tulav
Ôchildren (either/both sexes)Õ). That is, there is a syncretism of the three genders in the
plural number. This collapse of gender distinctions in the plural number is the kind of
syncretism which Corbett (1991: 190 ff.) calls convergence, and is a relatively common
phenomenon in the languages of the world. The only thing perhaps slightly less
common is the fact that gender distinctions are maintained throughout the dual number,
and converge only in the plural.
Having stated what kinds of elements must agree, it should be noted that there are some
instances of these elements in Lavukaleve which cannot show gender agreement. There
are some lexical restrictions to the rule that all adjectives must always agree in gender
with their head noun: the adjective bakel ÔbigÕ does not show gender/number
agreement, and the numbers from three to ten, which are also adjectives, do not show
gender/number agreement. Otherwise, all those elements mentioned above that agree in
gender must always obligatorily show gender agreement. This is normally a
straightforward matter; however there is one word ruima Ôold manÕ which has
anomalous agreement properties. This word is the topic of the next section.
THE HYBRID NOUN RUIMA ÔOLD MANÕCorbett (1991: 183 ff.) defines hybrid nouns as those nouns which Òneither simply take
the agreement of one consistent agreement pattern nor belong to two or more gendersÓ.
There is one word in Lavukaleve like this: ruima Ôold manÕ. All nouns referring to
human males are masculine in gender, except for ruima. This word always takes a
feminine, not masculine, definite article:
6)ruima

use a combination of both, or use one gender for agreement, then repeat themselves
using the other gender. In the following example, note the changes in gender agreement
between intonation units (slashes represent pauses on level pitch):

jt2 008jt2 050The anomalous agreement properties of ruima are due to the fact that it is assigned to
the feminine gender, even though it denotes a human male referent. Ruima is the only
word in Lavukaleve which behaves in this anomalous way with respect to its agreement
properties. Interestingly, the other human noun which could potentially have anomalous
agreement patterns is tu'tul ÔbabyÕ, which is neuter. However I have never observed
any anomalous agreement patterns associated with this word; it invariably takes neuter
agreement. Normally if speakers are discussing a particular baby they will refer to it
with a gendered noun, e.g. vo'vou ÔboyÕ or vo'vo ÔgirlÕ, instead of using tu'tul. Tu'tul
1326 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTis more usually used in the abstract, talking about non-particular cases; such cases are
easily compatible with neuter gender.
NON-PROTOTYPICAL CONTROLLERS AND DEFAULT AGREEMENTThe fact, stated above, that gender agreement is obligatory in all elements which are
able to show gender, presents problems occasionally. Corbett (1991: 203 ff.) discusses
the two types of problems typically associated with languages like Lavukaleve which
have so-called ÒenforcedÓ gender. The first problem arises when gender agreement
depends on a head which is not itself specified for gender. The second problem arises
when the speaker is unable to specify the gender of a referent. Lavukaleve deals with
the two problems in different ways.
In those cases in which gender agreement is controlled by an element which does not
have gender, Lavukaleve obligatorily uses 3rd person singular neuter agreement,
henceforth called Òdefault agreementÓ.
This kind of agreement can be seen for instance when the focus markers are in
construction with, and hence must agree with, an adjunct (first two examples) or a verb
(third example):

"322 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYReduplication has been found most frequently on verbs, but also on nouns, adjectives
and adverbial particles in the corpus. The exact shape which reduplication takes
depends partly on the syllabic form of the word to which it applies. There are three
types of partial reduplication, and full reduplication also occurs. Partial reduplication
can take the shape of reduplication of an initial CV, CVV or CVCV:
·
·
·CV reduplication: le ÔseeÕ le-le; namu ÔshakeÕ na-namu; haua Ôcare forÕ ha-haua;
telako ÔoneÕ te-telako; rongea ÔplayÕ ro-rongea; kiu ÔfightÕ ki-kiu
CVV reduplication: rao ÔsurroundÕ rao-rao; veo ÔarriveÕ veo-veo; ria Ôbe crossÕ
ria-ria
CVCV reduplication: namu ÔshakeÕ namu-namu; hului Ôgo roundÕ hulu-hului;
ruvale ÔhugeÕ ruva-ruvaleFull reduplication also occurs, but only in the following two adverbs in the corpus:
karial Ôslowly, gentlyÕ karial-karial, rikai ÔslowlyÕ rikai-rikai. These are considered
reduplications, not two separate repeated words, because they receive one primary
stress, on the initial syllable, which is one of the criterion for words (see below).
While vowel-initial words occur in the corpus, there are no examples of reduplicated
vowel-initial words (although compare iloilo ÔdifferentÕ discussed below, as a possible
example of reduplication in an earlier stage of the language). Similarly, while words of
closed syllables occur in the language, there are no examples of closed-syllable
reduplication.
Reduplication only applies to word stems, not to affixes on words. Thus kiu ÔdieÕ can
appear reduplicated as ki-kiu, and if it has a subject prefix, its reduplicated form
appears as o-ki-kiu (3sgS-DUP-die) Ôhe diesÕ. Similarly the transitive verb volori
ÔmakeÕ has been found as e-volo-volori-ne (3sgnO-Dup-make-IMPF Ô[they] were
making itÕ).
Reduplication is relatively flexible, in that the same word can appear with different
reduplication patterns. For example I have often heard the adverbial particle leon
ÔquicklyÕ, a word frequently heard in conversation, as le-leon, leo-leon and leon-leon,
all with the same meaning: Ôhurry up!Õ. Similarly, compare the forms of the adjective
tula ÔsmallÕ in the following examples:

5)mina

thing(f)tulatula
DupREDUP-tula
-a
small -sgfa little thingpr 095The precise form of the reduplication does not seem to have a functional difference: the
reduplicated forms mean the same thing as each other.
Reduplication is obligatory with the Reciprocal suffix (see Section 13.3.4). In other
contexts it often has a semantic function. The word mina ÔthingÕ becomes minamina
ÔeverythingÕ. Similarly lafa ÔplaceÕ when reduplicated is lafalafa Ôevery placeÕ. With
some verbs reduplication can give an iterative meaning, and can imply random action:
veo ÔarriveÕ veoveo Ôkeep touching atÕ, kini ÔsmellÕ kinikini Ôkeep sniffing aroundÕ.
With adverbs it can give an intensified meaning: karial ÔslowlyÕ karialkarial Ôvery
slowlyÕ. It does not always have a semantic function however: there is no meaning
difference between telako ÔoneÕ and tetelako ÔoneÕ.
There are words which are frozen reduplications: e.g. iloilo ÔdifferentÕ (there is no form
*ilo), and the verbal adjuncts va'var ÔtalkingÕ, fo'for ÔflyÕ and so on. See also Section
5.6 for evidence of old reduplications in nouns. These frozen forms suggest that a
process of reduplication has been available in the language for some time.
2.9.2 INSERTION OF GLOTTAL STOP BETWEEN VOWELS AT MORPHEME BOUNDARYWhen identical vowels come together at morpheme boundaries, a glottal stop is
optionally, but very rarely, inserted to break up the vowel cluster: ngo-oatum Ôyour
uncleÕ (2sgPOSS-elder.male) is normally pronounced [÷oatum], but has also been heard
as [÷oÖoatum] (if this rule does not apply, then this sequence in particular is subject to
the next rule to be described, reduction of identical vowels at morpheme boundaries).
This process is not obligatory, and is, in fact, quite rare.
2.9.3 V OWEL LOSSThere are three types of morphophonemic processes involving vowel loss. The first is a
process which reduces identical vowel sequences at morpheme boundaries. The second
is a process of loss of final vowels on nouns to which a Possessive prefix has been
attached. The third is a process in which the final /u/ of a verb stem is lost when that
verb is in a Possessor-subject construction.
REDUCTION OF IDENTICAL VOWEL SEQUENCES AT MORPHEME BOUNDARIESWhen identical vowels come together at morpheme boundaries, one of the vowels is
lost. For example, the 3rd singular neuter object verbal prefix e- plus the Subordinate
342 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYprefix e- reduce to e-:

boundaries. It is not a general rule of the language. Identical vowel sequences are
permitted within morphemes; see Section 2.5 above.
Occasionally, when the two identical vowels coming together are both prefixes,
particularly if both are o- prefixes, this rule of vowel loss does not apply, but rather both
vowels are pronounced as an identical vowel sequence:

gm 027S TEM-FINAL VOWEL LOSS AFTER A P OSSESSIVE PREFIXSome vowel-final noun stems, when prefixed with a Possessive prefix, obligatorily lose
their final vowel. Such noun stems are almost all disyllabic, of the form CVCV.
For example:352 - PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOPHONOLOGYbeko

kala

ÔfeelingÕ
ÔwordÕo-kala
o-gera
o-taluÔhis motherÕ
Ôhis feelingÕ
Ôhis wordÕThere are approximately twice as many roots which do not lose their final vowel when
prefixed with a Possessive prefix as those which do. This rule is discussed in more
detail in Section 5.5.
V OWEL LOSS WITH P OSSESSOR-SUBJECT CONSTRUCTIONSPossessor-subject constructions are an unproductive construction type in which the
subject of certain intransitive verbs is marked by a Possessive instead of subject prefix,
stress shifts to that prefix (see Section 2.7.2 above) and, for the verb stems ending in /u/
that enter this construction, the final /u/ is lost:

an NP. The expression of subject arguments by affixation is a matter of some
complexity; in some constructions subject affixes must appear, in some they cannot
appear, and in some they are optional. In coordinate-dependent clauses (see below,
Section 9.7.4 and Chapter 15), the subject cannot be expressed by an affix on the
predicate. In sentence-focus clauses a subject affix must appear on the predicate (see
Chapter 11.3.2). In adverbial subordinate-dependent clauses, subjects must be expressed
by affixation (but using a split-ergative marking system; see Section 16.1). In all other
cases, a subject affix may appear on the predicate, but it is optional. In all of these cases,
whether or not a subject affix appears on the predicate, an overt NP referring to the
subject may occur.
Core arguments, then, are most commonly expressed by verbal affixation, with,
optionally, an NP as well (see Section 18.2 for a discourse-based account of the
expression of arguments by NPs and affixation versus by affixation alone).
One could argue that the core arguments in Lavukaleve are the pronominal prefixes on
the predicate, not the overt NPs. Such an analysis would be by no means unique to
Lavukaleve; Foley (1986: 227-235) claims this for Yimas, and Van Valin and LaPolla
(1997: 33-34) for Lakhota. Van Valin and LaPolla point out in addition that the idea is
not new, citing von Humboldt (1836) as using this type of analysis for Classical Aztec
and Boas (1911) for Chinook.
2139 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREUnder this analysis, overt NPs, when they appear, are an optional elaboration of the
obligatory verbal affixes, and could be thought of in syntactic terms as being in an
appositional relationship to the pronominal affixes.
For Lavukaleve, one would have to account for the fact that there are circumstances in
which the subject affix (thus the expression of the core subject argument) is not allowed
to appear, but the NP referring to the subject can. This happens for instance in
coordinate-dependent clauses, where subject prefixes are incompatible with coordinatedependent verbs (see below, Section 9.7.4 and Chapter 15 for discussion of these). If
pronominal prefixes are the core arguments, and NPs are paratactic adjuncts to these, it
is difficult to understand the syntactic status of NPs when there is no verbal affix.
FoleyÕs (1991) response to a similar question in Yimas (in situations where a
pronominal prefix does not occur but an NP does) is to argue that there is in fact a zero
pronominal prefix there, holding the core argument slot. However I am reluctant to posit
zero pronominal prefixes where there is no direct evidence for them.
A second caveat to an argument for the core status of pronominal affixes versus NPs, is
as follows. The term used above, Ôpronominal affixesÕ includes the verbal prefixes on
predicates, Habitual Auxiliary prefixes, Present Tense suffixes, Imperative suffixes and
the Agreement Suffix (see Section 9.7 below). However there is a problem. Whereas the
pronominal prefixes only ever express subject and object, the two arguments that one
would want to call core in Lavukaleve, the Agreement Suffix can agree with not only
subject or object, but also oblique arguments such as postpositional objects, in focus
constructions and relative clauses. One would not want to call such arguments core,
simply because they can, in certain specific circumstances, be marked by the Agreement
Suffix.
There is a third major problem, related to the same issue of the morphological material
available to mark arguments. Although one could think of the verbal and Habitual
Auxiliary prefixes as arguments (in that they mark person, gender, number and
grammatical function), and possibly one could think of the Present Tense suffixes
(which mark Present Tense, and number of the subject) and Imperative suffixes (which
mark one of two types of Imperative mood, and number of the subject) in the same way,
it is much harder to think of members of the Agreement Suffix paradigm as arguments.
The Agreement Suffix forms only mark gender and number, and make no reference to
other important categories of referents, such as person or grammatical function. The
case for the core argument status of the Agreement Suffix would be very hard to
sustain.
None of these problems are fatal to an analysis of verbal affixes as core arguments and
NPs as paratactic adjuncts to these. However there is a certain counter-intuitiveness to
such an argument; and it requires positing zero affixes in places where there is no direct
2149 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREevidence for them. Perhaps a simpler and more intuitive account is that verbal affixes
and NPs together express core arguments. Different combinations of these exist to
express different pragmatic meanings.
Throughout this thesis, I refer to the pronominal prefixes as Ôcross-referencing prefixesÕ.
This should not be taken to mean that the NPs are syntactically prior in any way.
9.5 CLAUSE TYPES
Clauses in Lavukaleve divide into two major types: independent (main) and dependent.
Dependent clauses themselves are of two types: subordinate-dependent and coordinatedependent. The following diagram outlines types of clauses in Lavukaleve:
clause types
independentadverbialdependentsubordinatecoordinatepurposiverelativeMy terminology follows that of Foley (1986) in describing Iatmul, which (like many
Papuan languages) shares with Lavukaleve certain fundamental features in its clause
linking strategies. Foley argues for a distinction between main, subordinate-dependent
and coordinate-dependent verbs, defining subordinate verbs in the following way:
The subordinate clause functions like a part of the main clause, and this relation of a
part within the whole, or embeddedness, is how I will define subordination. Verbs of
such subordinate clauses, although fully specified in Iatmul for status and for person
and number of the actor, are necessarily linked to a main clause, and are therefore not
independent. I will refer to such verbs of subordinate clauses as 'subordinate-dependent'
and fully inflected verbs of main clauses as 'independent'. (1986: 177)and coordinate-dependent clauses as follows:
...clauses containing [coordinate-dependent] verbs are not considered subordinate. They
do not function as arguments of some main clause. They do not function as embedded
parts within a whole, but are linked to a fully inflected verb in a linear string, much like
beads on a necklace. Because the linking of the clauses is at the same structural level,
rather than as part within whole, I regard such clauses as coordinate and verbs of such
clauses as 'coordinate-dependent'. (1986: 177)2159 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREThis classification is particularly revealing for Lavukaleve. The classification of
LavukaleveÕs clauses, with morpho-syntactic criteria, is as follows:
MAIN (INDEPENDENT) CLAUSES·
·
·can stand on their own as a complete sentence
mark their own core participants using pronominal affixation on the predicate
specify their own TAMSUBORDINATE-DEPENDENT CLAUSES·
·
·are embedded (have a part-whole relationship with main clauses)
function as modifiers of main clauses
mark their own core participants (some types using a split-ergative system) on the
predicateCOORDINATE-DEPENDENT CLAUSES·
·are syntactically and semantically dependent on a main clause, but are not
syntactically or semantically a part of that clause
do not mark their own subject participants (but do mark their objects)Since in Lavukaleve clauses are headed by and are often coextensive with predicates,
the classification holds both for clauses and predicates. Some examples of these three
types follow:

viable syntactic unit, provides its own specification for subject, and also object, it has
the Future tense marked on it, and has an adjunct, the postposition ona.

mn3 065The example above contains a subordinate clause (italicised). Syntactically it is an
adverbial clause, modifying the main clause oina fiata la one fufum. It is marked with
the Anterior suffix, which indicates that the clause means Ôupon V happeningÕ. That is,
it provides a temporal starting point for the action of the main verb. The subject
participant ÔtheyÕ is expressed on the subordinate verb by means of the prefix vo(intransitive third person subjects of adverbial subordinate verbs are marked
2169 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREmorphologically as objects; see Section 16.1 for more on this).

-NFmn3 062The example above shows three coordinate-dependent clauses (with verbs lomare,
lofoure and ririgoiare). Each is dependent for the interpretation of their subject
reference on the final verb olei. As it happens, no TAM is marked on the main
(independent) verb, but the time reference of the coordinate-dependent clauses is
assumed to be that of the main (independent) clause. The verbs of all three coordinatedependent clauses are overtly marked as such, with the Non-Finite suffix -re. The
relationship between the coordinate-dependent clauses and the independent clause is
one of temporal succession. Fuller discussion of each of these clause types appears in
Chapter 15.
9.6 PREDICATE TYPES IN LAVUKALEVE
A predicate is the head of a clause, the element which takes arguments and which
carries pronominal affixation, in appropriate clause types, for at least one core
argument. The following predicate types exist in Lavukaleve:
·
·
·
·
·
·Simple verbs
Serial verbs in serial verb constructions and verb compounds
Habitual Auxiliary verbal complexes
Predicates formed with verbal adjuncts
Non-verbal predicates
Deictic predicates9.6.1 S IMPLE VERB PREDICATESSimple verb predicates consist of a single lexical verb. The verb may be transitive or
intransitive, and carries the participant marking appropriate for the clause type, and
TAM specifications of the clause in which the predicate appears. In the following
example, there are two simple verb predicates. The first is a transitive verb ho, marking
its object argument by affixation, and functioning as the head of a coordinate-dependent
clause (see above); and therefore not marking its subject argument by affixation. The
second simple verb predicate is the intransitive verb iru, marking its subject argument2179 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREand functioning as the head of a main clause.

3plS- sleep-re
-NFPutting it (f) inside, they slept.jn 0499.6.2 S ERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS AND VERB COMPOUNDSSerial verb constructions function in a similar way to simple verb predicates; but
structurally they consist of two or more lexical verbs which together act as a single unit
in terms of taking subject arguments and TAM specifications. Serial verb constructions
share their subject arguments, and if there is more than one transitive verb in the
construction, these share their object arguments. Verb compounds consist of two verbs
in juxtaposition functioning in every respect as a single predicate. The two constructions
differ in that every transitive verb of a serial verb construction must prefix its object,
whereas the entire verb compound only prefixes its object once.
Some examples of subject and object marking in serial verb constructions and verb
compounds follow. See Section 14.1 for a much fuller justification and discussion of
these constructions.

9.6.3 HABITUAL A UXILIARY VERBAL COMPLEXESVerbal complexes consist of a lexical verb in construction with the Habitual Auxiliary
(see Section 14.3 for discussion). The members of the verbal complex function as a
single predicate. They share their arguments, and participant marking is shared between
them, in a very particular way. The Habitual Auxiliary can only ever mark the subject
(S/A), never the object, argument (with one exception, in focus constructions, see below
Section 9.7.2, and Chapter 11). Note however that in subordinate constructions the
Habitual Auxiliary, like intransitive verbs, uses object prefixes to cross-reference the
subject argument in the third person, in what is essentially a split-ergative marking
system. This is discussed in Section 16.1. The verb can only cross-reference the object,
if it is transitive, never the subject. The auxiliary can use either a special subject prefix,
or else the Agreement Suffix, to cross-reference the subject. The following are
examples of these verbal complexes:
Intransitive:
35)Vala!

36)aluluri
a3sgmO-lulu
-ri
straight -CAUSleme.
le1plex-me
HAB...we sort it outao 013In each of the above examples, the Habitual Auxiliary me immediately follows a verb,
and, together with that verb, forms the predicate of the clause. There is a subject prefix
or suffix on me, and, if the verbal complex is transitive there is an object prefix on the
verb. Verbal complexes take their valency from the verb of the complex; me is not a
verb and has no valency.
9.6.4 P REDICATES FORMED WITH VERBAL ADJUNCTSComplex predicates formed with Verbal Adjuncts consist of two parts; the adjunct
expresses the lexical meaning of the predicate and takes no morphology, and it occurs
with a semantically rather empty verb, either hai ÔdoÕ or sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ
(always glossed ÔdoÕ), which takes any appropriate verbal morphology. Verb adjuncts
are a small closed class. Those which occur with sia are mostly loan verbs, and the
construction is used mainly to enable these loan verbs to be used in Lavukaleve
sentences. Some examples:2199 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURE

9.6.5 NON-VERBAL PREDICATESNon-verbal clauses consist of a non-verbal predicate and its subject argument. These
subject arguments are different from the subjects of verbal clauses, which were defined
in terms of morphological tests (i.e. cross-referencing). Non-verbal subject arguments
can be defined as the other NP argument of a clause with a non-verbal predicate. The
non-verbal predicate can consist of an NP, or a particle (italicised in the following
examples):

-o (feminine singular), -om (masculine/neuter singular), and -v (plural), attached to the
deictic in combination with the Presentative suffix -ri. The Predicative suffixes derive a
predicate from an adverbial or adnominal modifier or a nominal head. Thus, the
demonstrative hoina ÔthisÕ becomes hoinari Ôthis oneÕ with the Presentative suffix, and
hoinariom ÔitÕs this oneÕ with the masculine/neuter singular Predicative suffix. Such
predicates are restricted syntactically in that they cannot take any verbal morphology,
and can only take one argument.

9.7 CORE PARTICIPANT MARKING
Affixial participant marking is accomplished by means of:
·
··
·
·verbal prefixes, indicating person and number of subject and person, number and
gender of object (discussed in this chapter)
the Agreement Suffix, marking gender and number of a core argument; which core
argument depends on various factors to do with focus and clause type (Chapter 10,
Chapter 11)
prefixes on the Habitual Auxiliary, marking person and number of subject (Section
14.3)
Present Tense agreement, indicating number of the subject (Section 12.2.2).
Imperative suffixes, indicating one of two types of Imperative mood, and number of
subject (Section 12. 4.2).","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]"
"At the morphological level, then, in main clauses Lavukaleve treats NPs in A and S
function alike, and those in O function differently.
Semantic roles associated with the grammatical relation of subject in Lavukaleve
include agent (e.g. kuru ÔkillÕ), experiencer (e.g. le ÔseeÕ), patient (e.g. kiu ÔdieÕ) and
possessor (e.g. nuve ÔownÕ).
OBJECTSAs there are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve, it is no difficult matter to establish
2099 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREwhich NPs have the grammatical relation of object. For Lavukaleve, any core syntactic
function which is not an A or an S is an O; any grammatical relation which is not a
subject is an object. The morphological and syntactic criteria adduced above for the
justification of the subject relation work also, in converse, for the justification of an
object relation.
Many languages of the world allow at least a few ditransitive verbs. Lavukaleve,
however, does not. Typically ditransitive verbs such as ÔgiveÕ, ÔshowÕ and ÔtellÕ are
transitive verbs in Lavukaleve. They have two core arguments, and an optional
postpositional argument.
For example ne ÔgiveÕ is subcategorised for a subject and an object, which express the
giver and the gift, respectively, and optionally takes a postpositional phrase to express
the recipient. In the following example, the giver is ÔsheÕ, expressed as the 3sgS prefix
on eonege; the gift is Ôit (the food)Õ, expressed as the 3sgnO prefix on the same verb;
and the recipient is Ôher husbandÕ, expressed in the postpositional phrase Ôto her
husbandÕ (otum na ana):

jn 089One would not want to call the speech here a paratactic complement along the lines of
Noonan (1985, sp. 55 ff.). The speech is not syntactically linked in any way to the
clause which contains the verb of speech.
Thus, other possible candidates for the object grammatical relation are easily
distinguished from objects.
Semantic roles associated with the grammatical relation of object in Lavukaleve include
patient (e.g. kuru ÔhitÕ) and theme (e.g. le ÔseeÕ), and also the gift of ne ÔgiveÕ, and the
recipient of tai ÔtellÕ.
2119 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURE9.4 CORE AND OBLIQUE FUNCTIONS
Core functions are, according to Andrews (1985: 81) Òby definition A, S and O, and
whatever other grammatical functions are sufficiently like them to be plausibly grouped
with them and opposed to the others, which are the oblique functionsÓ. For Lavukaleve,
the core/oblique distinction is a simple one: subject and object are core; everything else
is oblique.
9.4.1 OBLIQUE FUNCTIONSNPs in Lavukaleve which are not subjects or objects are all oblique, and come under the
general term used in this thesis: adjuncts. Adjuncts are by definition not part of the
obligatory elements of a clause. They come in a variety of forms and functions.
Adjuncts encompass semantic roles such as instrument, location, time, goal, source, and
so on. There are three types of adjuncts involving nominals (all discussed in Chapter 7):
postpositional phrases; locational nouns with the Locative or Perlative suffixes; and
place nouns. Place nouns, a very restricted set of nouns, are the only nouns which can
function as adjuncts with no affixation or postposition to show their role. The following
examples show, respectively, a postpositional phrase, a locational noun with the
Locative suffix; and a place noun:

prefixes; the Agreement Suffix; and the Present Tense suffixes. Examples of each of
these possibilities follows.","[235, 236, 237, 238]"

Almost all intransitive predicates can occur in either stative/resultative or active
contexts. For most events it is usually possible to think of a stative, or more particularly
resultative, reading under which they could be conceptualised. For some events, it is
difficult to think of them in an active context, for example tave Ôbe notÕ or raravu Ôbe
redÕ. However most intransitive predicates in Lavukaleve typically occur in one
configuration, but can also occur in the other.
Most uses (about two thirds) of the Agreement Suffix on intransitive predicates are
stative; the rest are resultative. Selection of stative or resultative meaning depends
largely on the semantics of the predicate type. In particular, motion predicates with the
Agreement Suffix have a resultative rather than stative meaning, as do predicates
expressing meteorological phenomena. For example, consider the following motion
predicates with the Agreement Suffix. When motion predicates are used with the
Agreement Suffix they refer to the attainment of a location:

jn 021-022While a stative/resultative meaning is not obvious in such examples, it is quite possible
that this is the kind of meaning the speaker was intending. If Ôcrying outÕ is
conceptualised as a bodily state in the same way that Ôbeing seatedÕ is, then a
stative/resultative reading for these examples follows easily.
The fact that this verb lako ÔcryÕ is the only one with which stative/resultative meanings
are not clear could be something to do with the meaning of the verb itself. Significantly
however, this is the only intransitive verb with which a stative/resultative meaning is
not obvious when it is used with the Agreement Suffix. All other cases are far more
clearly semantically driven.
The semantics of LavukaleveÕs system of participant marking of intransitive predicates
are similar to the semantics of active/agentive participant marking systems described by
Mithun (1991). In Guaran’, Lakhota, Central Pomo, Caddo and Mohawk the subjects of
intransitive verbs are marked either in the same way as transitive subjects or in the same
24410 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXway as transitive objects, depending on the semantics of the verb; Mithun analyses these
as an active/agentive alignment system. However even though semantically the use of
the prefix versus the Agreement Suffix in LavukaleveÕs independent non-focus
intransitive predicates is similar to the active/agentive participant marking systems
described by Mithun, formally the system in Lavukaleve is not an alignment system; it
is not the case that there are two kinds of intransitive subjects, one marked like objects,
one marked like transitive subjects, as in MithunÕs languages. Rather, there are two
participant marking systems available: one uses the same system as used by transitive
verbs; one uses the system used in focus marking, in marking the heads of relative
clauses, and in marking adjectives to agree with their head nouns. The choice between
the systems in intransitive predicates is based on a semantic distinction between
stative/resultative and active clauses.
10.6 CONCLUSIONS
The Agreement Suffix is an important part of relative clause constructions, focus
constructions, adjectives and stative/resultative clauses. There is a semantic or
pragmatic connection between these uses.
Schachter (1973) suggests that there is a semantic link between focus constructions and
relative clauses, involving foregrounding:
...just as the focus construction reflects the assignment of special communicative
prominence to one part of an underlying sentence, so, I would suggest, does the relative
construction. In the case of the focus construction, greater prominence is assigned to
that part of the underlying sentence which is identified as relatively new information in
the resultant construction, i.e. the focused constituent. In the case of the relative
construction, greater prominence is assigned to that part of the underlying sentence
which determines the function of the resultant construction, i.e. the head noun. While
the basis for the foregrounding is quite different in the two cases, the foregrounding
itself Ð the divisions of a sentence into a more prominent part and a less prominent part
Ð is essentially the same. (Schachter 1973: 44)This approach shows a possible functional account of the use of the Agreement Suffix
in both relative clauses and focus constructions in Lavukaleve. There is also a common
functional link between relative clauses and adjectives in that both relative clauses and
adjectives function to modify nouns (Schachter also makes this link overt (1973: 4243)).
Further, the use of the Agreement Suffix on relative clauses and adjectives can be
related to its use on stative/resultative predicates. This relationship does not lie in the
concept of foregrounding; in fact Hopper and Thompson (1980, especially p. 285) show
that stative clauses tend to be backgrounded, not foregrounded. Rather, the relationship
lies more in the functional and in some cases formal overlap between adjectives and
24510 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXstative verbs in Lavukaleve, as indeed in many languages (see Section 3.3).
It is important to note that, as far as the rest of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax is concerned,
the Agreement Suffix is completely different in its nature from the verbal subject and
object prefixes, which also occur on predicates to mark participants. The Agreement
Suffix is used in pragmatically constrained environments. It never indicates the
syntactic function of the argument with which it agrees, although other features of the
construction in which it occurs may mean that one can tell what the syntactic function
of the argument it agrees with is. It does not indicate focus alone, but, with a focus
marker, it indicates particular kinds of focus, depending on its agreement.","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]"
"338CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Complex predicates
There are four kinds of complex predicates in Lavukaleve: serial verb constructions,
verb compounds, verbal complexes using the Habitual Auxiliary, and predicates formed
with verbal adjuncts. Serial verb constructions are common, although Lavukaleve is not
such a heavily serialising language as many Papuan languages; or indeed many of the
Austronesian languages of Oceania. If serial verb constructions are not a major feature
of Lavukaleve syntax, verb compounds are even less so; there are only three verb
compounds in the language. They probably represent lexicalised serial verb
constructions. The Habitual Auxiliary is an aspectual auxiliary which forms what is here
called a verbal complex: a predicate type that consists of a verbal head plus the Habitual
Auxiliary. Complex predicates formed with verbal adjuncts consist of two parts; the
adjunct expresses the lexical meaning of the predicate, and it occurs with a semantically
rather empty verb, which may be either hai ÔdoÕ or sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ.
14.1 SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS
14.1.1 INTRODUCTIONSerial verb constructions consist of two or, rarely, three verbs in juxtaposition,
functioning as a single predicate, with no morphology to mark their relationship with
each other. Each of the verbs receives its own stress, and thus is a separate phonological
word, but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Verbs of a
serial verb construction share their subjects and (if more than one member is transitive)
objects. They also share adjuncts. They share all their morphology except object
marking; all transitive verbs cross-reference their own objects. However, all other
categories that can be marked on verbs (e.g. subject marking, TAM, polarity, valency
changing, and other morphology) are marked only once on the predicate, and have
33914 - COMPLEX P REDICATESscope over the whole predicate. See Section 15.4.6 for an account of the difference
between serial verb constructions and clause chaining constructions.
The following examples illustrate some of the basic structural features of serial verb
constructions in Lavukaleve:

jn2 100-101In example (1) above, the first verb is transitive and the second intransitive; they share
their subjects (although these subjects are not cross-referenced). Both verbs are covered
by the scope of the Imperative suffix, which appears on the second verb. In example (2),
both verbs are intransitive, and the subject of the serial verb construction is marked only
once, on the second verb. In example (3) there are two serial verb constructions: vau
ehoire consists of an intransitive verb followed by a transitive verb. They are together
functioning as a coordinate dependent predicate, with Non-Finite suffix -re showing
this; note that the Non-Finite suffix appears only once on the predicate, on the final
verb. The transitive verb receives an object suffix. The second serial verb construction
in this sentence is another coordinate dependent predicate, again with the Non-Finite
suffix. Because these serial verb constructions are coordinate dependent predicates, they
do not cross-reference their subjects; this is a feature of all such predicates (see Chapter
15). Example (4) shows a three-verb serial verb construction, with the first two verbs
transitive, each cross-referenced for their object argument (though the object prefixes
refer to the same entity). The Imperative suffix on the third verb has scope over all three
verbs of the predicate.
34014 - COMPLEX P REDICATESThe next sections deal in more detail with these features.
14.1.2 S ERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS ARE SINGLE PREDICATESThe criterial feature of serial verb constructions is that they consist of two or three verbs
functioning together as a single predicate. This can be seen easily in Lavukaleve: serial
verb constructions participate in all the same constructions which simple predicates do.
Example (3) showed two serial verb constructions in the role of the coordinatedependent predicates of a clause-chaining construction. Further examples of serial verb
constructions serving as a single predicate in various complex constructions appear
below.
In the following example, ma ve Ôtake goÕ is the complex lexical head of a complex
predicate involving the Habitual Auxiliary (see Section 14.3 for a discussion of Habitual
Auxiliary constructions). The entire predicate is in a focus construction as well.

There is an array of morphological material available for marking referents in a discourse:
overt NPs can be used, and there are various types of verbal participant-marking affixes
depending on the predicate type. There is also the gender system, by means of which
participants can be differentiated by agreement on verbs and nominal modifiers. Also
important are the demonstrative pronouns, one of which is used to refer to activated
referents, and the other to refer to semi-activated referents, that is, referents which have
been mentioned before but are not the last referent to have been mentioned. In addition,
the focus marking system as a method of making reference to a participant, and at the
same time marking its role in the information structure of the sentence, is pervasive.
These phenomena have all been described at length in previous chapters. The purpose of
this section is to show how the interaction of all this linguistic material operates in texts to
refer to and, if necessary, disambiguate participants. It also aims to show that, even
though this material does exist and can be used for this purpose, very often
disambiguation of participants is not a priority, and in fact, in many cases, identity of
participants is understood through extra-linguistic rather than linguistic means.
18.2.1 INTRODUCING PARTICIPANTS WITH OVERT NPSIn general, participants are introduced by overt NPs, and tracked by verbal agreement
affixes.
The following excerpt is taken from the beginning of a story about a boy and a married
couple of giants. These two participants, the boy and the couple, are the main
protagonists throughout the story. They are introduced first, in a., just by overt NPs, as
the title of the story. The first real sentence of the story, sentence b., restates the NP
referring to the giant couple, as the subject. The only verbs of this sentence are Durativemarked, which means it is not possible to also cross-reference their subject with verbal
morphology. The next sentence, c., reintroduces the boy with an overt NP, and verbal
prefixing. The boy is the subject of the following sentence, d., beginning with feure
Ôgoing upÕ, and he is tracked by verbal prefixing alone. There is a change of subject with
the last verb of this sentence, shown by the dual subject marker on the verb lore Ôthey
two sayÕ. From the dual number it is to be inferred that it is the giant couple who spoke.
The next sentence, e., returns to singular subject marking, by which the referent can be
inferred to be the boy. In the following sentence, f., there is an overt NP reintroducing
the giant, bagatum na, as an actor, thus avoiding the ambiguity which would have
otherwise arisen. He remains as the actor throughout this and the next sentence, g., but in
the last sentence the subject changes to his wife, who is reintroduced with an overt NP.
43118 - DISCOURSE ORGANISATIONWe only know that the NP otua la Ôhis wifeÕ refers to the subject here, and not the
object, because of gender agreement. Subject prefixes do not show gender agreement, but
object prefixes do. The object prefix is masculine, while the overt NP is feminine, so the
NP cannot refer to the object, therefore, by elimination, it must refer to the subject.

"2249 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTUREParticipant marking by affixation in simple verbal non-focus clauses depends in part on
the transitivity of the predicate. Transitive predicates may mark both their core
arguments with prefixes; the first prefix position marks the object argument, the second
prefix position marks the subject argument:

co2 0779.7.2 AFFIXIAL PARTICIPANT MARKING IN SIMPLE VERBAL FOCUS CLAUSESThere are three types of focus, corresponding to three types of focus constructions:
argument focus, sentence focus and predicate focus (see Chapter 11 for a detailed
account of these types). Each is marked morphologically by a focus marker, and
Sentence-Final focus constructions also have the verbal Agreement Suffix agreeing with
a constituent of the clause. The Agreement Suffix agrees with the object argument of a
transitive predicate focus clause, the subject argument of a transitive sentence focus
clause, or the subject argument of an intransitive clause. The constraint that each core
argument can be expressed by affix a maximum of once per predicate means that, if one
argument in a focus clause is marked by the Agreement Suffix, it cannot also be marked
by a prefix; and further, if the other argument is expressed affixially it must be
expressed by a prefix.

1. each participant can be marked by affix only once per predicate
2. objects must be referred to by an affix on the predicate, subjects do not have to be
3. on intransitive verbal predicates, a cross-referencing prefix is used if the predicate is
to be interpreted as active; the Agreement Suffix is used if the predicate is to be
interpreted as stative/resultative
4. in a Sentence-Final focus construction, the Agreement Suffix always crossreferences one core argument, and, if the predicate is transitive, a prefix crossreferences the other
9.7.4 P ARTICIPANT MARKING IN NON-SIMPLE VERBAL PREDICATESSections 9.7.1 and 9.7.2 describe the basic participant marking systems. There are
adjustments to the basic system to be found in non-simple predicate types, as described
below. For detailed discussion the reader is advised to consult the chapters mentioned.
In verbal complexes (which consist of a verb plus the Habitual Auxiliary), the Habitual
Auxiliary marks subject, and the verb, if transitive, marks the object (see above and
Section 14.3). In the following example, the object is marked by affixation on verb, and
the subject is marked by affixation on Habitual Auxiliary; a focus marker (with default,
i.e. 3rd singular neuter, agreement) intervenes between verb and Habitual Auxiliary:

"35714 - COMPLEX P REDICATESthat such constructions are also mostly focus-marked; as are most negative sentences in
Lavukaleve (see Chapter 11 and Section 17.2).
14.3.3 THE INTRANSITIVE VERB ME ÔCONTINUEÕIt was mentioned above that there is an intransitive verb formally identical to the
Habitual Auxiliary. The intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ does not form a complex
predicate; however, it is worth noting its main features here for the sake of comparison
with the formally identical Habitual Auxiliary. This section aims to briefly show that
this intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ is easy to formally distinguish from the Habitual
Auxiliary.
The intransitive verb me ÔcontinueÕ is no different from other intransitive verbs in the
language. Whereas the Habitual Auxiliary has its own special set of S/A prefixes, the
intransitive verb just uses the regular S/A prefixes common to all intransitive verbs.
Compare the prefixes used in the following sentences with those shown in Section
14.3.1 above. The 3sg subject prefix for the Habitual Auxiliary is lo-, and o- for the
verb (examples (46) and (48)). Similarly, the 1st plural exclusive subject prefix is le- for
the Habitual Auxiliary, and e- for the verb (47). In addition, like all intransitive verbs,
me ÔcontinueÕ can function as the sole predicate of a clause:

mn 027The two words, me Habitual Auxiliary and me ÔcontinueÕ, are obviously semantically
very closely related; indeed there is often no semantic distinction between them.
Presumably they are also historically related. However there are these crucial morphosyntactic differences which force them to be recognised as different morpho-syntactic
entities. When me appears with verbal subject prefixes, as sole member of a predicate, it
is the verb ÔcontinueÕ. When it occurs with the special set of Habitual Auxiliary
prefixes, immediately following a verb, it is the Habitual Auxiliary. Of course, rather
than considering them separate words, one could consider the difference between them
as simply arising out of different constructions in which they occur. The analysis here,
35814 - COMPLEX P REDICATESof one as a verb and one as an auxiliary, is intended to highlight the combinatorial

Me ÔcontinueÕ can of course also occur in other complex constructions which are open
to verbs. In the following example, me is the main verb of its clause; ngosiveham is a
purposive adverbial clause subordinate to the me clause. The me clause is focusmarked.

14.4 VERBAL ADJUNCT CONSTRUCTIONS
Verbal adjunct constructions involve a non-predicating element expressing the lexical35914 - COMPLEX P REDICATESmeaning of the construction, in conjunction with a semantically fairly empty verb,
which enables the element to function as a predicate by providing the necessary
morphology.
There are only two verbs in Lavukaleve which take part in such constructions: hai ÔdoÕ
and sia Ôbe, become, happen, doÕ. The lexical elements involved are of a number of
types, different for each verb. Both verbs can also act as simple predicates; they do not
always occur in these verbal adjunct constructions.
Verbal adjunct constructions are extremely common in Papuan languages, particularly
those of the highlands of mainland PNG (Foley 1986: 119). Lavukaleve differs from
many of these languages in that, while it does have verbal adjunct constructions, they
are not a pervasive feature of Lavukaleve grammar; and in fact there are only two verbs,
and very few adjuncts, that take part in the constructions.
The verb plus adjunct is treated here as a complex predicate because the adjunct of these
constructions is tightly bound to the verb: while the verb is the predicating element, in
that it controls number of arguments and takes the morphology, the adjunct is closely
bound to the verb, and the two elements function as a single constituent. It is not
however an argument of the verb, and is never cross-referenced on the verb.
14.4.1 HAI ÔDOÕHai ÔdoÕ is an ambitransitive verb, which, in its intransitive function, can act as the verb
of a verbal adjunct construction. The lexical elements it can occur with in this
construction are very few, and consist only of the class of verbal adjuncts: fo'for Ôfly,
ÔprepareÕ; va'var ÔtalkingÕ; so'sor ÔfastÕ and ko'kor ÔtightÕ. These words are
presumably old reduplications, although there is no evidence in the language today of
*for, *var, *sor or *kor.
See Section 3.16 for criteria distinguishing verb adjuncts from other word classes. Some

article and demonstrative modifier. This makes a certain amount of intuitive sense: the
definite article and demonstrative modifier, both marking definiteness, refer to an entity
as something that both speaker and addressee can be expected to be able to identify.
This is consistent with the functions of mea, which marks an entity as one that the
speaker knows and expects their addressee to be able to identify. However, even though
it makes intuitive sense for mea and the definite article or demonstrative modifier to cooccur, it is still not possible to predict when the definite article or demonstrative
modifier would occur with mea and when they would not. This is a subtle area, difficult
for a non-native speaker to fully understand.
Even though it is not strictly relevant to NP structure, it is worthwhile, in this discussion
of mea, to note that mea can also occur in a non-adjectival use, in construction with
particles and nominal adjuncts (i.e. postpositional phrases, locative-marked nouns, and
place nouns). In construction with particles and nominal adjuncts it creates either an NP
or a nominal modifier phrase with that word or phrase. In (32), the particle hano forms
an NP head together with mea, and takes the definite article. In (33), the particle akari
Ôlike thatÕ, together with mea, modify the head noun le ÔdayÕ. In (34) akari mem
functions as the conjoined head (with leftenan, separated by the conjunction ve ÔorÕ) of
the NP leftenan ve akari mem roa ane Ôlieutenant or something like thatÕ:

w2 050The precise semantic function of mea in these constructions is difficult to capture,
although it seems to be similar in some respects to the semantic function of mea with
nouns.
Example (36) shows an idiom in the language; the normal way to refer to a sibling is to
use a phrase consisting of the postposition ne ÔwithÕ (correctly prefixed) followed by
804 - NPS AND P OSSESSIONmea (suffixed to show the gender and number of the sibling in question). Literally, the
phrase means Ôthat one with me/you/etc. who you all know aboutÕ. Thus ngane mea
above is Ômy sisterÕ, and, for instance, ngone mem is Ôyour brotherÕ (2sg-with SPECsgm). In this idiom, mea frequently co-occurs with the definite article and ro, the
indefinite adjective.

not. If a speaker wishes to refer to two of a noun which does not have a special dual

an NP. For example, the noun sevo (m) ÔvowÕ, has a singular form sevo, and a plural
form sevokal, but no dual form. It is the singular form rather than the plural which is
used for two vows:

well as the forms and functions of demonstratives, is discussed in detail in Section 8.6.
THE DEFINITE ARTICLEThe definite article occurs in the final syntactic slot of an NP. Its form agrees with its
head noun in number and gender. It has the following inflectional paradigm.masc

na

va824 - NPS AND P OSSESSIONThe definite article marks definiteness. That is, it marks a referent as being one which
the speaker knows the identity of, and assumes the addressee knows the identity of as
well. Definiteness may come from the referent having unique reference, from being the
only one of its kind (and therefore known to the addressee), or from being previously
introduced in the discourse. These are all well exemplified in Lavukaleve.
In the following example, the definite article appears with kui ÔsunÕ by virtue of its
unique reference; there is only one sun, and the speaker can thus assume the addressee
to have a definite referent for it.

article, once its definite identity has been established.

without the definite article. Note that when place names which would normally appear
with a Locative suffix have a definite article, they cannot have the Locative suffix, but
instead use a postpositional phrase (see Section 3.1 for an account of place nouns, and

postpositional phrases).

Edward Sapir LanguageCHAPTER EIGHT
Deictics
8.1 INTRODUCTION
The deictics to be considered in this chapter are of two main types. There are the
pronoun/demonstratives, and the locative deictics. Apart from these, there is also a
third, very rare set of demonstrative identifiers.
The pronoun/demonstratives include first and second person pronouns, two paradigms
of demonstrative pronouns (foia and oia), and a paradigm of demonstrative modifiers
(hoia) (these words are referred to in their feminine singular medial-distance forms
throughout the discussion). The demonstratives mark gender, number and three degrees
of distance of the referent from the speaker, plus making another distinction in the distal
form between specific and nonspecific distance. It is shown below that hoia is a
demonstrative modifier and foia and oia are demonstrative pronouns which differ in
their degree of activation in the discourse. The three-way distinction which is drawn
between foia, hoia and oia, is a complex and problematic area in the description of
Lavukaleve morpho-syntax; and an important one in terms of fundamental morphopragmatic categories of the language.
The locative deictics are for the most part syntactically simpler than the demonstratives.
They include the four-member paradigm hoka/hoika/heaka/hoaka Ôhere/there/there
far/there far, unspecifiedÕ; koka~oka ÔfarÕ; uke ÔnearÕ; ika ÔthereÕ; aka Ôthen, next, so,
etc.Õ; igala and gala ÔthereÕ and ka Ôlocational emphaticÕ. These forms, for the most
part, function as locational adverbs, that is, syntactically they are adjuncts.
Both the pronoun/demonstratives and locative deictics can appear with certain suffixes:
Group suffixes -sa (ungendered) and -h a (feminine), the Extended -la, and the
Presentative and Predicative suffixes -ri and -o/om/v respectively. Only certain of the
1558 - D EICTICSdeictics can appear with each of these suffixes.
To begin with the first and second person pronouns will be examined. Following this is
a discussion of demonstratives foia, hoia and oia. Each paradigm is discussed
separately, then the relationships between them are examined. Each of the locative
deictics is discussed in turn. The penultimate part of the chapter discusses the
morphological affixes available to these deictic words. The final section examines the
infrequently-occurring set of demonstrative identifiers.
It would take far more time and space than is available to cover all aspects of the forms
and use of LavukaleveÕs deictics. In the discussion to follow, I mention only briefly the
spatial functions of these deictics, and instead concentrate on a description of their
morpho-syntax and some aspects of their use in narratives. This chapter does not cover
pronominal affixes; their use is treated in Section 9.7.
8.2 FIRST AND SECOND PERSON PRONOUNS
8.2.1 FORMFirst and second person pronouns in Lavukaleve are marked for person and number.
First person non-singular pronouns are also marked for inclusion/exclusion of the
addressee. Pronouns are not marked for syntactic function. The paradigm is as follows:1 EXCL
1 INCL
2SGDUPLngaiel
mel
imile
me
imiinuDual forms are identical to plural forms, with the addition of /l/. The segment /l/ is a
pervasive dual marker in the language, but in other areas of the language, e.g. lexical
items, it is attached to the singular form of the word, rather than to the plural form, to
create a dual.
The only further affixial morphology available to first and second person pronouns is
the Group suffixes -sa and -ha. They are discussed below (Section 8.10.1).
8.2.2 FUNCTIONSFirst and second person pronouns are mostly only used for special emphasis. All the
information contained in first and second person pronouns is also contained in the
largely obligatory verbal cross-referencing and agreement morphology (see Section
9.7); thus, the free pronoun forms are not needed for disambiguation or identification of
arguments. In fact, they contain rather less information than verbal cross-referencing
1568 - D EICTICSmorphology, as they do not specify gender and convey no information about syntactic
function.
Pronouns function as the heads of NPs (see Section 4.1.1). The following set of
examples illustrates the use of free pronouns in texts:

"23610 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXinvolve (in terms of their morpho-syntax at least) a sentence focus construction; it is not
possible to mark predicate focus in negative clauses. Negation is discussed in general in
Section 17.2, and with particular reference to focus constructions in Section 11.3.2.
In all Sentence-Final focus constructions, the Agreement Suffix must obligatorily agree
with the same element that the focus marker agrees with. Together, the Agreement
Suffix and focus marker serve to show morphologically what type of focus a particular
construction is expressing.
There are rare examples in which a transitive predicate receives the Agreement Suffix to
mark an argument, but there is no focus marker, and the construction is not a relative
clause. For example:

jt2 036Such examples can always have a focus marker inserted after the verb with the
Agreement Suffix on it; in fact it appears that these examples are a fast-speech casual
expression of a focus construction. When transcribing such constructions, informants
usually correct them by inserting a focus marker. Similarly, when asked if such strings
are grammatical, informants usually give a preferred version with a focus marker. So
example (14) above is, according to native speakers, better expressed as the following:
17)Akovere

speakers, even though they do (rarely) occur in natural speech. Note that most of the
examples of this phenomenon in the corpus are given by just two speakers.
23710 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXIt seems, then, that these sentences are focus constructions without the focus marker.
Constructions involving the Agreement Suffix on the verb, without any grammatical
environment to account for it, can be seen themselves as the equivalent of focus
constructions proper, at least in casual speech.
10.3.1 OMISSION OF THE A GREEMENT S UFFIX IN S ENTENCE-FINAL FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSWhile the Agreement Suffix is an integral part of Sentence-Final focus constructions, it
occasionally happens that in an otherwise normal Sentence-Final focus construction the
Agreement Suffix is omitted. This only occurs with the plural Agreement Suffix, and
only in casual speech. For example:

emk 016The fact that this only happens with the plural Agreement Suffix may suggest that it
could be a phonologically-determined phenomenon, but there are no other examples in
the language of word-final /v/ being omitted.
Native speakers produce these sentences, but they correct them if I produce them, and
when transcribing such sentences produced by other native speakers they often accept
them only reluctantly, preferring to restore the Agreement Suffix on the verb. Note that
the absence of the Agreement Suffix on transitive predicate focus sentences leads to the
anomalous situation that the verb is not cross-referenced for its object, which all
transitive verbs in Lavukaleve must be.
10.4 THE AGREEMENT SUFFIX WITH ADJECTIVES
The Agreement Suffix occurs obligatorily on all regular adjectives in an NP to agree in
23810 - THE AGREEMENT S UFFIXnumber and gender with the head noun of the NP. For example:

ch 007Note that the plural suffix on the nouns in example (22) is not the Agreement Suffix; it
is one of many suffixes used to create plural noun forms. See Section 5.6.2 for a
discussion of plural suffixes in nouns. The segment /v/ is pervasive as a marker of
plurality throughout the language.
If there is more than one adjective in an NP, each one has its own Agreement Suffix.
That is, the Agreement Suffix is the property of an individual adjective, rather than a
whole modifier phrase:
24)Ali
rua
folufolum
keaki mem
roa

I saw a big fat hungry man.e1 023eIn the above example, there are three adjectives in one NP. The first adjective in the
sequence, rua ÔbigÕ, is an irregular adjective with its own inflectional paradigm, so it
does not take the Agreement Suffix (see Section 3.3). But the second adjective,
folufolum ÔfatÕ, has the Agreement Suffix, as does the third. The expression of ÔhungryÕ
is actually formed by a complex phrase involving keaki, plus Specifier adjective mea
(see Section 4.1.2), which carries the Agreement Suffix.","[262, 263, 264, 265]"

example, the first focus marker is the heo form because the clause is an information
question. The second focus marker is heo because, as the second focus marker of a
focus-echo construction, it has to be:

that ngai is the subject and ÔitÕ is the object because of the context; the sentence means ÔI
own itÕ, not Ôit owns meÕ. The focus marker and the object marker agree with the same
referent, which must be the subject because the verbal prefix cross-references the object.

103) but in elicitation such sentences are rejected in favour of variants with the heo focus
marker.
·Strong emphasisHeo may be used in situations where the speaker wishes to convey strong emphasis. The
emphasis is associated not just with the constituent with which the focus marker agrees,
but over the whole sentence. The emphasis may be of various kinds.
In the first example, a story-teller, Savaka, is telling a story about a fish poison, called
hola. Savaka introduces the story, talking about what the ancestors used to do in the
olden days, then saying that this is going to be a story about hola. Then he turns to a man
at his side and says ÒThatÕs your name!Ó, to general laughter from the audience. He is
making a pun; the word hola also means ÔliarÕ. The construction Savaka uses to make the
pun is this (small caps are used to show strong emphasis here):
99)ngoalang
hi
ngo-a- langi
hi
2sg- A- name(n) 3sgnEFOC
ITÕS YOUR NAME!cs2 005The following would also be a perfectly acceptable sentence:
100)ngoalang
fi
ngo-a- langi
fi
2sg- A- name(n) 3sgnFOC11
ItÕs your name!e1 052That is, the clause could be constructed using either heo, as Savaka used, or feo.
However if feo was used, the emphatic point would not be made; and the statement
would no longer be a joke.
In the following pair, either heo or feo may be used, but using heo is more emphatic. It
is contrastive here; the speaker is referring to the two people who started the village of11The -a- in the first of these examples is a meaningless syllable added by the speaker for special
humorous effect, during the story from which the sentence is taken. When I elicited the second example,
my informant added the -a- as well, in parallel with this example which I had just given him for
comparison. Both sentences could occur without it.","[311, 312, 313]"
