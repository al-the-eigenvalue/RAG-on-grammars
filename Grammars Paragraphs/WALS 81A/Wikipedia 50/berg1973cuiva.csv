wife or another member of the family when he wants to talk at night. All they need to do is gnint
at the appropriate time and he continues to talk or tell a story for hours. At times we have heard a
man provide his own response. He takes the part of both the speaker and the listener, adding the
appropriate response as needed.
There is a large amount of repetition in the texts. Some of this has been left in to illustrate its
frequency.",[63]
"Response. A section usually has two participants, the speaker and the listener who makes the
response.
The response usually is a reply to the speaker’s words or an acknowledgment of his words, by the
repetition of the speaker's words, either the complete utterance or the final portion of it. The
section-final pause (a down glide) signals the listener to provide the response. Occasionally the
listener may interrupt before the section-final pause. The speaker usually continues with what he
was saying, ignoring the interruption.
in order to signal that he is finished, the speaker repeats (Repit) the response of the listener. This
also permits a chaige of speakers so that the listener becomes the speaker.

"Cuiva isa Guajiban language of the Hanus or plains country in the states of Vichada, Boyaca,
and Arauca in the east central portion of Colombia, South America, The Cuiva Indians live by
hunting and gathering in the jungles along the Meta, Casanare, and Capanapara Rivers and their
tributaries.
The language is spoken by an undetermined number of nomadic groups, and estimates of total
population range from several hundred to 8,060. We have had contact with five Cuiva groups or
bands: (1) the Pin Menepiwi (the Big River people), (2) the Mayaraxi (the Mayayeros), (3) the
Yarawutixi, (4) the Wapiwi, and (5) two groups of Aitowapiwi (Masiguares), All the groups are
called Cuiva by the Colombian settlers. There are very slight dialectical differences among these
groups. The Cuiva of the Tomo River (6) in Vichada are of another dialect more closely related to
Guajibo. For the general location of the above groups see the area map of the Cuiva migrations.
The Pin Menepiwi dialect is described here.
The data for this description were gathered during field work under the auspices of the Summer
Institute of Linguistics from July 1965 to December 1967 and trom July 1969 to March 1970. The
material was gathered using a monolingual approach, since there were no Cuiva who spoke Spanish.
The main informants were:
;
Waro
(1965-67)
Warawanayo
(1969-70)
Wasimo
(1965-67, 69-70)
Tabsi
(1967, 1969-70)
Sepia
(1966-67; died 1968)
;
We are grateful to all the Cuiva Indians for their acceptance of us and their persistence in helping
us to learn their language well.Many of themassisted in teaching us their language, both in their
semi-permanentvillage at Mochueloand whenwe travelled with them on the Meta and CasanareRivers.
0.2. Cuiva is described in terms of the following levels: discourse, episode, section, sentence, clausc,
group, stem, and root. Of special interest are the section and the group. The section has an
