"2.2 Distinctive features of Koyra Chiini
KCh and DjCh share many features which distinguish them from the main block of
Songhay languages (KS, HS, Zarma, etc.).
First, KCh and DjCh (like KS) lack lexical or grammatical tone distinctions of
the sort typical of the non-Malian languages (Zarma, Dendi, etc.) and still going
strong in HS.
Second, KCh and DjCh have merged *z and *j (affricate) as j, so z is no longer
part of the phonology except in a few recent loanwords. KCh j may therefore
correspond to either KS z orj, hence the homophones in (26).

Third, KCh and DjCh show S-MAN-V-X constituent order (subject, mood-aspectnegation, verb, other elements including direct object), while KS, HS, and the nonMalian varieties show S-MAN-O-V-X order with the direct object preceding the verb.
In Greenbergian terms, Western Songhay is SVO while the other varieties are SOV,
though the latter are not verb-final languages in the fashion of Turkish and Japanese.
The SOV Songhay varieties also show a Transitive marker between the MAN complex
and a direct object NP (if present); there is no trace of this in KCh or DjCh.
KCh and DjCh share Def di and PI yo in NPs. (These are also found in the Bamba
dialect of KS.) Mainstream KS and most other Songhay languages have different
DefSg and DefPl suffixes.
DjCh differs from KCh on many counts. DjCh has seven phonemic vowel
qualities to five for KCh. DjCh favors in situ relativization and WH-interrogatives,
while KCh fronts the relative pronoun and the WH-interrogatives. Because of the many
lexical differences between DjCh and KCh, it is necessary to devote separate
dictionaries to them. For more details on DjCh grammar, see Appendix 2.","[31, 32]"

Overview2.1 Brief outline of typical sentence and NP structures
For purposes of initial orientation, this section provides examples of typical sentence
structures. The basic constituent order is SVO (subject-verb-object), and more
precisely the ordering in (5):

Some examples of adjective sequences are given in (102). The literal glosses retain the
word order of the original.",[103]
"5.9 Adpositions and case-marking
5.9.1 Unmarked case versus adpositions
The distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order.
Subject NPs precede MAN morphemes and the verb, which is followed by direct
objects and PPs. When a direct object is fronted in the focalization construction it
precedes the subject NP and is normally followed by Foe morpheme na. Although
subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers, there is rarely any difficulty in
identifying these case functions. (135) is a simple transitive example.

Def]Certain personal pronouns (3Sg, 3P1) have distinct forms for subject and object
function, the subject variants also being used before postpositions (§4.1.1).
Topic NPs ending with Top bine ('as for'), which precede the sentence proper, are
also unmarked for case; see §5.8.2.
Many ""adverbs"" can be thought of as nouns or simplified NPs denoting times,
locations, and similar concepts. If so, they can be analysed as NPs unmarked for case
on the surface, though some kind of locative is implied ('tomorrow' = 'at tomorrow').
Most other grammatical relations are expressed by postpositions to be described in
the following sections, though in some cases the postposition can be omitted.",[119]
"4.1.4 Subject and Object forms of pronominals
The simplest type of NP is a bare personal pronoun. The basic forms are shown in
(58); variants and irregular allomorphs are commented on below.

(58) shows distinct subject and object forms for the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1. The other
pronouns have a single, invariant form (shown in a central S=O column between the
S-only and O-only columns). In the case of ISg, the orthographic distinction reflects
what is arguably a subphonemic positional variation in the pronunciation of the
diphthong nucleus (§3.3.1). The only real subject-object variation is therefore in the
""3"" category, where the object form (which directly follows the verb) is 3Sg ga or 3P1
gi (sometimes palatalized to ji, §3.6.4). Some examples of the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1 are
given in (59); the syntactic order is subject + verb + object as in English.

c. i kar ga

"11.3 Perception
Perception predicates, as in English, have a subject NP representing the perceiver
and a direct object representing the perceived object or its sensory emanation. The
primary verbs, all transitive, are given in (710). mom normally means 'hear, listen,
understand (words, language)', but has the sense 'smell' in connection with an object
like hew 'wind, air, odor'. The verb maata is a more abstract stem meaning 'become
aware of, through unspecified sensory channels.",[382]
"[NP] - MAN morphemes - verb - ...
[NP], - tx - MAN morphemes - verbIf the Foe morpheme na were added to (28Ib) in order to differentiate the subjectfocus construction (28Ib) from the simple (28la), there would be a serious risk of
ambiguity, since na is also the (perfective) Neg morpheme. A subject-focus
construction (282a), with null MAN marking (indicative perfective positive) would be
homophonous with a simple Neg sentence (282b).
(282)a.
b.",[187]
"(438)Here there are not one but two pronominal postverbal constituents, direct object
ga and Dat war se. We may consider this to be an enclitic string, attached as a whole
to the verb bar. In such cases, the direct object enclitic obligatorily precedes any
cliticized PP.
The cliticization analysis is useful in accounting for pronominal morphology as
well as constituent order. In (438) we have an instance of 3SgO ga, which differs in
form from a short 3Sg allomorph a. The longer ga is used in direct object function, in
which case it immediately follows the verb (for a 'give' construction with two such
object clitics, see the following section), ga is also the 3Sg form following the
preposition nda 'and, with'. The a variant is used in other functions including subject,
possessor of NP, and object of postposition. The 3P1 variants gi and i follow the same
pattern (§4.1.1). We could argue that the gV variants are required when the third person
pronominal is a) enclitic (to a verb or ndä), and b) is not bracketed with another
following morpheme (i.e., a postposition).
Alternatively, we could limit enclitic status to direct-object pronouns, in which
case condition (b) could be dispensed with since PPs would not be covered. But a good
case can be made for taking certain pronominal PPs as clitics. First, the ordering of
pronominal PPs before nonpronominal complements, as in (437), seems to be
obligatory with certain postpositions; the rare counterexamples in texts probably
reflect clause-internal repairs and are not confirmed in elicitation. Second, irregular
forms for the ISg and 2Sg dative combinations, used only in postverbal position, are
best analysed as special enclitic forms. Consider (439).

"418 Appendix 2
9.1.1 Ordering and pronominal cliticization
The ordering of postverbal constituents appears to be much as in KCh, with
pronominal objects coming first, then pronominal adpositional phrases, then definite
(or otherwise ""old"") NPs, then indefinite NPs. Examples in (793a-b).

in KCh. This is most common when the object NP is a simple one like demonstrative
woo di 'that one' as in (794), but there are occasional textual examples with more
substantial NPs.

Sentence-level syntax and semantics9.1 Object NPs and other postverbalconstituents
9.1.1 Ordering and cliticization of postverbal constituents
The ordering of postverbal constituents is basically determined by two main factors.
First, certain types of constituents must occur at or near the end of the clause. This
applies most rigorously to DF morphemes with clausal scope, where clause-final
positioning is obligatory. However, even full phrasal constituents may gravitate
toward the end of the clause, either because they are semantically peripheral or because
they represent afterthought-like elaborations of referents which are represented earlier in
the sentence. Moreover, ""heavy"" constituents that might otherwise occur closer to the
verb may be shifted (extraposed) to clause-final position.
The second generalization is that, after hiving off these clause-final elements, the
remaining phrasal constituents are normally ordered in such a way that
pronominalized, ""old,"" or otherwise backgrounded referential material occurs in
immediate postverbal position, followed by noun-headed, ""new,"" or otherwise
relatively foregrounded material. Consider (437a-b).

"6.3 Compounds
6.3.1 Noun-verb compounds
Noun-verb compounds are rare, but they are easy to spot on grounds of word order (NV) and semantic skewing. The examples I know of are in (214). The compounds
function syntactically as verbs.
(214)N-V cpd.

hari-gurgloss

'draw water'6.3 Compounds139The verb hammee 'fast (from food)' is perhaps still synchronically recognizable
as hawjnee 'tie-mouth' (for assimilation of w to m see §3.6.3). This would then be a
V-N rather than N-V structure, functioning as an intransitive verb.
There are many other combinations which have some resemblance to such N-V
compounds as (214). These are cases where the second stem is a verb, which is
followed by an Adj or (nominalizing) Abstr ending. The sequence N-V-Adj can
theoretically be bracketed either as [N-V]-Adj, with a N-V compound feeding into
adjectivization, or as N-[V-Adj], with a noun stem added as compounding initial to an
already adjectivized verb. Likewise for the sequence N-V-Abstr. In the cases known to
me, the inner N-V compound is not independently attested, and in view of the
productivity of N-N (and ""loose"" NP-N) compounds I am strongly inclined to favor the
N-[V-Adj] (and N-[V-Abstr]]) bracketings. Examples in (215-16). Zero-derived
nominals (217) are less easy to bracket.

verb functions as a modifier of the noun, see §4.6.8.
6.3.2 Verb-verb compounds
It is very easy to combine VPs, by putting the second one in infinitival VP form
(beginning with Inf ka); see §9.7.1. This can be used to combine two VPs, both of
reasonable internal complexity. It can also be used to combine a specialized serial verb
with an internally complex second VP (§9.7.2).
The limiting case is a tightly-knit combination of two verb stems linked by ka
with no further frills, or with following postverbal material (direct object, PPs) that140 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation
appears to be attached to the verb-combination as a whole rather than just to the
second verb. In such combinations, which we refer to as verb-verb compounds, the
order of elements is usually fixed, and the compound as a whole can be nominalized or
form other verbal derivatives.
A common example is sar ka julli 'do somersaults', with sar 'jump' and a
second verb that is not attested outside of this compound. Other examples generally
involve paired actions that commonly occur together in some activity (cf. English cut
and run). That the system is potentially productive is shown by (218).

"3.9.2 Stress, incorporation (tight compounding), and cliticization
Stress is nonphonemic, with neither lexical nor grammatical significance, in the
analysis and transcription used here. In a few cases, an unusual phonetic stress3.10 Historical phonological notes49placement may be a surface indicator of vowel length in a position (before a consonant
cluster) where duration is an unreliable surface cue; see §3.7.9.
As in many languages, multisyllabic words tend to have reduced phonetic stress
(intensity, pitch, vocalic duration, etc.) on final syllables, especially CV syllables.
Even stem-final CVV syllables in nonmonosyllabic words tend to be heard as
unstressed short-voweled phonetic [CV] when prepausal or at the end of syntactic
phrases, so the length of final vowels is best determined by adding a grammatical
formative, e.g. Def di in the case of nouns. The lack of intrinsic stress on final
syllables allows speakers to use final syllables to express higher-level intonational
patterns (e.g. rising pitch marking interrogation or a desire to keep the floor).
Many grammatical morphemes, though transcribed as separate words, are regularly
unstressed and tend to pattern as proclitics or enclitics to nouns, verbs, and other
lexical stems. We do not emphasize this issue here since the phonological
consequences are usually nonexistent or subtle. For that matter, there are no
completely reliable phonetic indices of affixation or incorporation (tight compounding,
§4.6), as opposed to word sequencing, and our decisions about which morpheme
sequences to recognize as single-word compounds and which to separate
transcriptionally are based largely on semantic lexicalization and morphosyntactic
patterning.
The best case for cliticization as a formal feature of the grammar involves
postverbal pronominal objects and pronominal PPs. These elements normally
immediately follow the verb, preceding other postverbal constituents that involve full
(noun-headed) NPs (§9.1.1). The dative forms of two pronouns, ISg and 2Sg, also
show special forms in this postverbal position, as opposed to the regular forms they
have in fronted (focalized, preverbal) position (§3.8.1-2).","[64, 65]"

""They send them (=parents-in-law) a ceremonial parent-in-law plate.'
nin 'drink', qaa 'eat', and bey 'know' are transitive verbs: qaa ga 'eat it' (with
3SgO g ). The direct object is often omitted as in English (Ί have drunk', Ί have
eaten,' Ί know'). They are thus only weakly transitive, and accordingly can be made
causative by adding Fact-Caus suffix -ndi (§6.2.2), hence nin-di 'give to drink',
rjaa-ndi 'feed', and bey-ndi 'inform, teach', ffin-ditends to be used in special senses
including 'irrigate'. The causatives of 'eat' and 'know' are recorded in VPs of the type
ijaa-ndi Υ Ζ and bey-ndi Υ Ζ, with two unmarked postverbal NPs, one (Y)
representing the underlying agent of 'eat' or 'know', the other (Z) representing the
underlying object. As usual with postverbal constituents, the linear order of Υ and Ζ is
variable (§9.1.1). No adposition is present in the available examples, whether both Υ
and Ζ remain in place, or one of them is extracted (e.g. as a WH-interrogative). An
example involving extraction is (451); see also (207b-c) in §6.2.2.

semantically. There is a logically possible scope difference between, say, Only [in [its

slight and a syntactic fixing of the order does not cause communicative problems.

These examples show various combinations of presence or absence of postposition
wane. We get wane after both possessors in (97a), after the rightmost only in (96),
after the leftmost only in (97b), and after neither in (97c).
5.2.3 Possessors as apparent heads of the higher NP
In the English sentence My dog ran away but John's is still here, the possessor John's
appears to function as head of the higher NP and denotes John's dog. Alternatively, we
could say that the head noun is expressed by zero (John's 0 is...).
The same pattern occurs in KCh. In this case, the postposition wane is
obligatory. In the ordinary definite case, wane is directly followed by Def di, a
combination which is irregularly realized as wan di (§3.8.4). Examples in (98), with
the position of the unexpressed head noun marked by 0.","[101, 102]"

DefJ5.11.2 Conjunction of two full NPs, or of a pronoun and full NP
It is much easier to conjoin two full NPs (i.e. any NPs other than personal pronouns)
with nda, since the microsyntactic rules affecting pronominal conjunction do not apply
and since full NPs have no morphological distinction between subject and object cases.
Given two full NPs, A and B, either A nda Β οτ Β nda A is syntactically
grammatical. Of course, discourse factors will be involved in the left versus right
positioning of the two conjuncts, but there is no real syntactic issue here.
There are some idioms with fixed order, as in tene nda aljaka 'good luck' (lit.
'forehead and luck').
Extended nda strings with more than two conjuncts are possible, as in (162).

as a higher-order negation with a complete proposition as its complement (§9.3.2).
Sixth, discourse-functional (DF) morphemes like moo 'also, moreover', and the
quantifier kul, can be added to Y nono either after the NP (Y) or after the nono,
apparently with different scope readings. (232) shows the ""Y"" constituent with weak
Top ta, which in ordinary sentences is most typical of subject NPs and preposed
topical constituents (§8.4.3). In (233a), moo in the sense 'moreover' has scope over
and follows the entire equational clause addabba ye nono. However, in (233b),
which follows immediately on (232) in the relevant text, moo takes narrow scope over

Introduction1.1 Generalities about Songhay
Songhay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.

""
eastern Songhay (S. oriental)
central Songhay (S. central)For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning21 Introductionwith Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
(Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"The remaining morpheme is French mais 'but', pronounced [me:]. Aside from
accidental homonymy (mee 'mouth'), there is a more significant overlap with clausefinal Emph mee, used chiefly after imperatives (§8.5.7), and for native speakers the
two mee particles are possibly thought of as the same morpheme. I transcribe mais
rather than mee when the particle expresses a semantically adversarial relationship
between two clauses (Ά, but B'). In this usage, mais is generally the onset of the B
clause, as in (514a). In (514b), the particle is prosodically the termination of the A
clause, where one usually finds Emph mee rather than mais, but the sense points to
'but'. Apparently the speaker began a 'but' clause with mais and then restarted this
clause with ammaa in order to edit out the half-assimilated French borrowing.",[291]
"For the possibility of opting out of logophoric pronouns in long quotations, see
the following section. For cases involving sloppy (partial) coreference, as in 'he, said
they,y would come' and 'theyxy said shey would come,' see §10.4.2.
It is not at all uncommon for an extended quotation to itself include embedded
second-order quotations. Suppose we have a sequence of the schematic type (624).
(624)X said to Υ [Q1... Υ said to X [Q2... X ... Υ ... ]].",[342]

"In most cases, as in (559a), the hal clause denotes an eventuality that is both a

However, in (559b) the result is quite unintended by the unfortunate animal. There are
also examples where the intended result was not in fact actualized, as in (560).ayfaani hal

'There are many ailments that they can't cure except with alkaafun
(spice).'(406a-b) involve direct object NPs, (406c) a spatiotemporal adverbial, and (406d-e)
instrumental NPs. When the constituent in question is a direct object, the fuller twopart construction (405b-c) appears to be grammatically preferable to the single-clause
pattern (406a-b). In (406a), for example, the quantifier kul 'all' (= 'any') shows up on
the NP in the 'except' phrase, though it would make more sense on the (omitted)
correlative NP in the initial negative clause (""That disease doesn't afflict any donkey,
except a donkey that is healthy'). I think, then, that we can regard the single-clause
type (406a-b) as a truncated version of the fuller construction.
The two instrumental examples (406d-e) show different word orders, kala 'except'
preceding nda in (406d), while bara 'except' follows nda in (406e). Follow-up
elicitation with Timbuktu informants showed that nda bara X and bara nda X are
interchangeable.
There are some textual examples where bara or kala takes scope over a following
clause denoting an eventuality that serves as an exception to that expressed by the
preceding negative clause. Here we gloss bara or kala freely as 'except that ...'. This
is arguably the case in (407a-c).

"8.1 Focus constructions
Many sentences have no special focus marking. There are, however, productive devices
for marking a particular non-verb constituent (pronoun, full NP, PP, lexical adverbial)
as grammatical ""focus."" The semantic-pragmatic point of marking a focus is to
highlight it as a choice made among two or more logically possible options. The
focused constituent therefore bears the most contestable, unexpected, or novel
information. WH-questions, and answers to them, are the prototypical examples.
Syntactically, the focused constituent is fronted to the left of the obligatory core
of the sentence (subject NP, MAN morphemes, verb). In most cases a focus
morpheme [SFoc or Foe] is inserted between the focused constituent and the core of
the sentence. Nonsubject and subject focus constructions must be distinguished.",[182]
"9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs
In this section we begin our analysis of infinitival VPs, which consist of Inf
morpheme ka plus a VP (without subject NP or any MAN morphemes). Examples of
Inf VPs are ka koy 'to go' and ka noo ga_^ i se 'to give it to them'. Infinitival
complements lack Impf or Subju markers and cannot take normal negation; for a
rough functional equivalent of negation see the discussion of serial-verb jen in §9.7.6.
The regular constructions involving Inf ka can be classified as in (577).

in certain idiomatic phrasesBy ""serial verb"" we mean a verb that is specialized to occur in combination with a
fuller VP, which we will call the ""substantive VP."" Most serial verbs occur in pattern
(577b). The less common pattern (577c), where the substantive VP precedes the
specialized serial verb, is found with ben 'end, finish' (§9.7.5) and in the comparative
construction with bisa 'exceed' (§9.7.8). The full VP represents the core scenario
('boy kill dog'), while the attached serial verb adds a grammatical category (aspect,
mood), motion, or a higher predicate (e.g. 'try').
In the following sections we consider in turn the various formal subtypes shown
in (577a-c,e). Several sections are devoted to serial verbs, which encompass several
distinct semantic complexes. For the relatively few verb-verb compounds of type
(577d), see §6.3.2.
Notably absent from these sections are desideratives (Ί want to go'), verbs of
allowing and preventing (Ί let him eat,' Ί prevented him from eating'), and for the
most part purposives (Ί slaughtered the sheep in order to eat it'). Though these often9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs305take infinitive form in English and other familiar languages, they are expressed in
KCh by finite subjunctive clauses, e.g., Ί want that I go' (§9.6).
Certain serial-verbs in pattern (577b) take zero or ta instead of ka as the Inf
marker. See (§9.7.2) for a full inventory of serial verbs and of their syntactic
peculiarities.
Rarely, Inf ka is used to overtly nominalize a VP which is fronted as a focused
NP constituent. See §4.3.5.
Infinitival VPs cannot be conjoined by nda 'and', and cannot be complements of
adpositions (e.g. preposition nda 'with' or Dative postposition se). However, wala
Or' may be used, as in (578).

"In one passage (824), Infinitive ka follows French pour que 'so that' in an event
sequence. Contrast the subjunctive complement of pour que in (816), §9.6.2, above.
The effect is like French pour plus infinitive (pour chercher...).

"5.11.1 Conjunction of personal pronouns
That the pattern X [nda Ύ] 'X and Y' is asymmetrical even when X (left conjunct) and
Υ (right conjunct) are of the same syntactic type is most clearly seen by studying the
forms they take when X and Υ are personal pronouns. There is a standardized ordering
of the pronoun categories along a (grammaticalized) topicality hierarchy, and certain
pronominal categories take different forms as left and as right conjuncts.
The ordering of categories normally follows the hierarchy in (157), as seen in
(158). Counterexamples with ordering inverted occasionally occur in direct elicitation,
probably reflecting interference from French cues, but are unidiomatic and do not occur
in texts. Simple 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns never occur as left conjuncts since this is an
""exposed"" syntactic position forcing replacement of (unmarked) 3Sg by 3SgF and of
3P1 by 3P1F (§8.4.2).

3SgOLogophoric pronouns fit somewhat variably into the hierarchy (157), reflecting the
fact that a (third person) logophoric pronoun in reported speech represents a first person
pronoun in the original speech event (Ί am coming' becoming reported-speech 'Hex
said he, (LogoSg) was coming'). See end of §10.1.2 for examples and discussion.
Some subdialects of KS express Ί, and hey' as 'we,y and hey' and so forth, the left
conjunct being pluralized to subsume the denotation of the two conjuncts. This1145 Nominal inflection and N P syntaxconstruction does not occur, to my knowledge, in KCh, and combinations like (158a)
with singular left conjunct are normal.
From (158c-d) we can see that the right conjuncts take the same form as directobject pronominals. This is most obvious with 3P1O gi ~ ji and 3SgO ga, but all other
pronominal right conjuncts are at least compatible with this morphological equation.
The left conjunct might then be taken to be associated with subject status. There is
some syntactic evidence for this, since expressions like 'hex and hisx mother' require
reflexivization of the possessor pronoun. However, (158d) shows that a 3Sg left
conjunct appears as 3SgF ijga rather than as ordinary 3SgS a. Left conjuncts are
therefore an ""exposed"" syntactic position in the sense of §3.8.8 and §8.4.2, unlike the
usual (proclitic) subject position.
The subject-object asymmetry supports a bracketing [X [nda Y]], in which the
right conjunct is the immediate complement of nda. However, this judgement depends
in part on our overall interpretation of the morphosyntactic status of object pronouns,
on which see §9.1.1.
In ""correct"" English we say he and I went, his and my (=our) house, and you saw
him and me. That is, case is assigned to the pronouns on the basis of their syntactic
function in the larger sentence, as in [you saw him] and [(you saw) me]. In colloquial
English, on the other hand, freezing of conjoined pronominal forms occurs as the old
accusative forms generalize, resulting in e.g. [him and me] went. However, this is not
usually extended to the possessive: W[him and me's] house.
In KCh, pronominal conjunctions are invariable in form and are therefore not
sensitive morphologically to surrounding syntax, even when functioning as possessors.
Consider (160).","[129, 130]"
"9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs319The three options are of the schematic types (ΟΙ) Ά is more than Β,' (Ο2) Ά
equals B,' and (O3) Ά is less than B.' In English, the sequence could be expressed
without changing the order of the comparanda, facilitating syntactic reduction: 'should
the flavor of the sugar be more than, equal to, or less than that of the tea leaves?' In
KCh, however, the O3 option requires reversal of the ordering ('B is more than A') if
the bisa construction is adhered to.
Another option for Ά is less than B' is a main-clause negation plus an attached
infinitival VP with too 'attain, reach, be the equal of, as in (610). Note that the
infinitival VP is included in the scope of the negative, otherwise the translation would
be Ί equal him in (extent of) not eating.'","[334, 335]"
"6.2 Derived voice forms
6.2.1 Zero derivation (simple verbs with variable valency)
Here we discuss cases where the same verb stem is used with variable valency. In
§4.3.2 we discussed similar cases where a stem may be used as a verb or noun without
derivational affixes. Subsequent sections will describe overt morphological derivations
which change valency.
In (204), S and Ο stand for the referents functioning as subject and direct object,
respectively, in the transitive case.

'S become (turn into) O'In (204a-b), the grammatical subject of the intransitive corresponds to the direct
object of the transitive. In (204a), the intransitive events or states can occur in the
absence of an external agent, so we might argue that the transitive usage is the
semantic factitive-causative of the intransitive. On the other hand, in (204b) the
intransitive events or states strongly imply the presence of an (unexpressed) agent, so134 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation
we could argue that here the intransitive usage is a semantic passive based on the
transitive. In (204c), the intransitive omits the direct object of the transitive, so the
intransitive can be thought of as a kind of antipassive.
In (204d), the connection between 'come* and 'become' is less transparent, but
English come to be, and the use of motion verbs to mean 'become' in many other
languages (Fr. devenir, Spanish volverse), makes the connection more reasonable.
KCh kaa 'become' is formally a transitive verb, and the direct object can be a pronoun
like 3SgO ga, as in (205).","[149, 150]"
"Since ci links a subject NP with a postverbal NP, it resembles a transitive verb.
In many languages, an equational sentence with copula would be distinguished from a
transitive by case marking (copular 'X-Nominative be Y-Nominative' versus transitive
'X-Nominative hit Y-Accusative'), but KCh has no overt case marking for the
postverbal NPs in either case. If a third person pronoun functions as predicate NP after
ci, it takes the form 3Sg ga or 3P1 gi, just like direct object pronouns, as in (223), a
particularly common phrase.",[159]
"Each of (6-8) begins with a subject NP, which in (7-8) is a personal pronoun. The
MAN position is occupied by Impf o in (6), by zero in (7), and by Neg na in (8).
Except with equational and locational quasi-verbs, a zero MAN position is interpreted
as perfective positive, which is extremely common in past tense narrative. The verb
stem, here guna 'see', has no inflectional affixes for either pronominal agreement or
MAN categories. The direct object NP follows the verb (though not always
immediately), whether it is a pronoun as in (7) or a full NP as in (6,8). Further
constituents such as adverbial modifiers generally follow the direct object NP, as with
doodi 'there' in (6-7) and the Locative PP in (8). However, when a verb is followed by
two or more complements (NPs and PPs), their linear ordering reflects morphological
and discourse considerations as well as pure syntax.
The maximal internal structure of a NP or PP is schematized in (9).
(9)possessor - noun - adjective - numeral - demonstrative - Definite Plural - DF[discourse-function] - postposition
Examples of this structure are (10-12).",[27]

expressed as a first or second person pronoun, Logo should be thought of as a special
type of third person pronoun. However, within the quotation itself it has affinities
with first person, since Logo is the reported-speech replacement of a direct-speech first
person pronoun.
The relationship of logophoric pronouns to the classic lst-2nd-3rd persons can
also be analysed by studying the normal relative order of two pronouns conjoined by
nda 'and, with'; see (157) in §5.11.1. Leaving logophoric pronouns aside for the
moment, the ordering hierarchy is 1st > 2nd > ""3F' > {3Sg, 3P1}. There are two
logical ways, a priori, to fit logophoric pronouns into this system. One would be to
take Logo as a relatively high-ranking 3rd person pronoun, preceding ordinary {3Sg,
3P1} and perhaps even ""3F* pronouns but following all 1st and 2nd person categories.
The other approach would be to treat Logo as an embedded 1st person pronoun, and so
locate it hierarchically ahead of 2nd person. In fact, the data show examples of both
possible hierarchizations. The textual example (622a) shows Logo ijgu following 2Sg,
while the elicited example (622b) shows the opposite ordering. Textual example
(622c) shows that Logo precedes ordinary 3rd person pronouns, while the elicited
(622d) has Logo following a true 1st person pronoun.

"Here moo is not locally attached to the PP a ra, which in fact is precisely the one
constituent shared by 'there are fish in it* and 'they farm in it.' As (409), shows, when
moo is connected to a specific PP, it attaches to the NP preceding the postposition,
whereas in (410) moo follows the entire PP. Therefore, in (410) moo has clausal
scope.
There are a small number of textual instances where moo is positioned after a verb
before postverbal constituents, but none where moo can really be described as having
narrow scope over the verb. In (345) in §8.3.7, above, positioning of moo after a
transitive verb may be due to the heaviness of the following direct object NP (which
includes a long relative clause).
Examples like (410) are common, but there are also quite a few textual examples
where moo is physically attached to the subject NP (or a preposed topical NP) but
where the context suggests clausal scope. In other words, moo can attach to the
subject or preposed topical NP for convenience, allowing the speaker to specify at the2308 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationbeginning of the current sentence its additive relationship to the preceding discourse.
This seems to be typical when moo functions at the pragmatic level (Ί tell you
moreover that...'), where the absence of overtly realized pragmatic material forces the
speaker to attach moo (which cannot stand alone) to a surrogate constituent. Consider
(411).

—In the first descending generation, the term 'child' (also used as a non-kinship
term, as with English child) is applied to one's own offspring or that of one's
brothers. There is a special term for Si's child. The basic stems are gender-neutral, but
compound finals 'man' and 'woman' can be added to specify gender (§4.6.3).
In the first descending generation, ije 'child' is the basic term for one's own So or
Da. It is often extended to one's siblings children, especially by men to their brother's
children. There is a special ""nibling"" (nephew or niece) term tuba for Si's children,
used by men. Women often use composite expressions meaning 'Br's child' or 'Si's
child' for their siblings children. The 'child' and 'nibling' terms are optionally genderspecified by adding compound finals (§4.6.3). Relevant forms are in (716).

From the husband's viewpoint the wives are ranked by seniority (marriage order, not
birth order) as wände beer 'senior wife' and wände ciina 'junior wife' (oiina 'small').
From the perspective of one wife, another wife is called wocce (<*woy-ce) 'co-wife'.
Since polyandry is not practiced, there is no comparable relationship of 'co-husband';
the male counterpart of woace is haroe 'male lover; (male) suitor (of a woman)'.
The term konde can denote 'FaWi who is not one's Mo' (i.e., a co-wife of one's
mother), or 'MoBrWi'.
This sketch suffices to describe the basic consanguineal and affinal categories.
More distant kintypes can be incorporated into the system either by composite
expressions ('my cousin's child') or by semantic extension, respecting the parallelcross distinction (e.g., FaFaBrSoSo = 'brother').
More general expressions for 'kin' are illustrated in text fragment (718).","[384, 385, 386]"
"6.2 Derived voice forms1376.2.5 Suffixation of -nda to verb stem
In §6.1.6 we discussed verbs which commonly take an instrumental-comitative
complement (nda 'with' plus NP), perhaps separated from the verb by an intervening
constituent. There are also some combinations where the -nda seems to act as a suffix
on the verb, creating a derived transitive. The two constructions can be schematized as
in (210a-b).
(210)a.
b.[subjectNP]

V-nda...
...[nda [NP]]
[NP]There is no clearly audible difference between (210a) and (210b) when no other
constituents intervene, but when there is such an intervening constituent the
distinction is clear. It is probable that the type (210b) is historically derived from
(210a) by redrawing of word boundaries. (210b) is typical of comitative function
('along with, together with'), whereas the instrumental function of ('by means of) is
normally expressed as (210a).
The examples which we ascribe to (21 Ob), with derivational verb suffix -nda, are
given in (211). ""S"" and ""O"" denote the referents functioning as subject and direct
object, respectively, in the derived form.

"In (437a), ni foo 'by yourself is a kind of delayed elaboration on the preverbal
2SgS pronoun, so it occurs finally. This leaves two other postverbal constituents, the
Dat PP a se 'to (for) it' and the indefinite direct object NP hin-ey 'mastery'.
Although the interpretation of the Dat PP is dependent on that of hin-ey, which would
seem to favor the ordering... hin-ey [a se]..., the preference for putting backgrounded
(especially pronominal) material first prevails, so we get ... [a se] hin-ey ... .
Likewise, in (437b), one might expect the direct object 'sheep' to follow the verb
immediately, on grounds of semantic bracketing, but instead the pronominal PP 'at
her place* intervenes. In both (437a) and (437b), with a pronominal PP preceding a
noun-headed direct object NP, informants strongly disapprove of the reverse ordering.
One possible analysis is that a pronominal PP is enclitic to the verb. An
""enclitic"" is an unstressed morpheme (or morpheme string) which is attached to a
preceding full-fledged word. We could hypothesize that object pronominals and
pronominal PPs are cliticized to the verb, while full NPs (and full-NP-headed PPs)
cannot be. Consider now (438).",[259]

"3.3 Diphthongs
By ""diphthong"" we mean the sequence of a vowel nucleus plus a semivowel coda y or
w within a syllable, i.e., word-internally before another consonant or word-finally.
There is some justification for treating diphthongs as quasi-units, since only certain
vowel-semivowel combinations occur. All diphthongs in the language are upgliding
(vowel plus semivowel).",[34]
"3.7.8 Deletion of word-initial vowels (apheresis)
Except for French loans and a few grammatical morphemes such as personal pronouns,
words do not normally begin with vowels. The two chief exceptions are Arabic loans
beginning in a, and certain nouns and adjectives beginning in /'. Many of the Arabic
loans probably entered KCh from other African languages (cf. §3.10.8), which
probably accounts for the variation in their form.
Arabic has a definite prefix al-, which undergoes a special assimilation to a
following coronal consonant (affricate j is treated in Classical Arabic as noncoronal,
but in most modern Maghrebi dialects as coronal). As with Arabic loans into European
languages (algebra, algorithm), Arabic nouns borrowed into KCh often include the old
definite prefix, though the prefix is no longer segmentable and no longer marks
defmiteness. This gives rise to the KCh surface patterns in (43), where T is a coronal
consonant and K is a noncoronal (velar, labial) consonant:
(43)Four onset types of nouns borrowed from Arabic
a. alKV... , as in albacir 'miser';
b. a/V... after loss of glottal stop or pharyngeal, as in alaahidu 'promise';
c. IV... , as in (b), with further elision of the initial *a, as in ladab 'polite
person';
d. aTTV... , as in adduhaa 'mid-morning'.
The Arabic sources here are al-baxii!, al-Taahid(u) (or other form of the root
, al-'adab, and ad-duhaa.",[53]
"One way to analyse (247-49) is to posit a phonologically unrealized low-content
(""light"") verb DO or BE. This would work fairly well in (247-48), where haya foo
and maa, respectively, could be taken as postverbal direct objects. However, the
analysis would not work in (249). In both (249a) and (249b), 3SgO ga is clearly the
direct object, and as an enclitic pronominal must directly follow the verb (§9.1.1).
There is no way to insert a DO verb into (249a-b) and produce a grammatical sentence.
Therefore we must take the 'whatchamacallit?' word as a verb, not as an NP following
a phonologically unexpressed verb.
One might compare the verb-like use of the ordinarily nominal haya foo, maa,
and haya-jje with the use of original morphological nominalizations diya-terey and
seede-terey as verbs, see (87f) in §4.6.4, above.",[170]
"5.8 Markers of discourse status
5.8.1 Focus (Foe na and SFoc rjga)
Focalized constituents (as we use the term here) are always fronted to a position
preceding the remainder of the clause. This is most obvious with constituents that are
otherwise postverbal, such as direct objects and adpositional complements. Since
subjects are clause-initial anyway, their focalization does not produce an obvious
""fronting,"" but one can argue nonetheless that fronting occurs here too.
The usual markers of focalization are Subject Focus (SFoc) qga, inserted
obligatorily between a focalized subject and the following material (MAN morphemes,
then VP), and non-subject Focus (Foe) na, which can be omitted under some
conditions but is usually present after an NP (or adverbial) fronted from post-verbal
position. Simple examples are in (129).

'What [focus] are you looking for?' (nonsubject focus)For fuller discussion of the syntax, see §8.1.1-2. Historically, na reflects a weak
demonstrative *no 'there' and is therefore related etymologically to identificational5.5 Markers of discourse status101quasi-verb nono 'it is', §7.1.1. (KS has no as both a focalizer and a reduced 'there'
demonstrative.) SFoc rjga is intriguingly homophonous to 3SgF pronoun rjga (§8.4.2).
There is considerable variation in the form of SFoc morphemes throughout the KChDjCh-KS zone, permitting speakers of each dialect to make different morphemic
associations (with attendant ""deep"" syntactic analysis) for the SFoc marker.
It is doubtful that either na or rjga forms a surface constituent, strictly speaking,
with the preceding focalized constituent. If it did, one would expect that the particle
would occur as part of truncated WH questions ('who?') and as part of truncated replies
to WH questions (Q: 'What did you find?'; A: ""The dog'). However, na and rjga are
never used in this way; the truncated interrogative or reply consists simply of the
focalized interrogative pronoun or NP. The truncated form of (129b) is maa 'what?',
not #maa na, and that of (129a) is ay T, not #ay rjga.
NPs (and PPs) are not the only constituents that can be, in principle, focalized.
VPs can be focal (Q: 'What did you do?'; Α: Ί cried'), as can truth values ('Yes I did
see him'). However, in KCh there is no overt grammatical marking of verb, VP, or
truth-value focus. In practice, ""focus"" applies to NPs, PPs, and adverbials like 'here'
and 'today' which can be analysed as reduced or defective NPs.","[116, 117]"

'to (for) the white man who saw you(Sg)'se
DatHere the bracketing is intended to show that the final Dative postposition se takes
as its complement the entire NP 'the white man who saw you', rather than (just) the
2Sg pronoun. One could imagine a more aggressive use of such brackets, perhaps
requiring them in all sentences, but I prefer to make sparing, opportunistic use of this
device, both in this grammar and in the published text collection.
In the texts volume, emendations (of addition, replacement, or omission) are fairly
common. Many emendations of omission involve false starts, though some involve
errors which the speaker immediately corrected. In order to make these emendations
transparent to readers, the following bracketing and italicization conventions are
applied:
addition: {har di};
replacement: {har di} with a note describing the emendation;
omission: <har di— > (usually false starts) disregarded in translation.","[23, 24]"
"In (272a), the NP positions clearly coindexed with the focused constituent are in
the second and third clauses of a three-clause sequence ('we bend over, we look at
themx, we touch them x ') which functions en bloc as a conditional antecedent bound by
nda 'if. Note gi 'them' twice as a resumptive pronoun coindexed with the focused
constituent 'bits'. There is no clearly coindexed trace in the main clause ('we find that
small chunks are in it'), although one might argue adventurously that 'bits' occurs8.1 Focus constructions169logically in this clause in some way (On the basis of ...'). In (272b), the resumptive
pronoun 'it' is the subject of a 'that' clause subordinated to the verb 'notice'.
There remains the question whether Foe morpheme na forms a constituent with
the preceding fronted constituent, serves as a complementizer introducing the
following core sentence, or has an independent syntactic status. In other words, is
English Beans I like or clefted It's beans that I like (with complementizer that) the
better syntactic parallel to the KCh na construction? I find it difficult to make this
decision on empirical rather than theory-internal grounds.
In the focus construction, the fronted constituent and the core sentence are, in
general, tightly knit prosodically. There are occasional textual examples where one
detects a brief pause after na, but hesitations can also occur after that in English clefts
due to processing considerations, cf. the free translation of (272b). Examples like
(271) could be taken as evidence that na is bracketed with the preceding focalized
constituent, but only if we consider the material intervening between na and the tracecontaining clause as being completely outside the focalization construction. However,
it is preferable to bracket the type in (271) as 'NPX na [[we come] and [we share /, ]],'
with the 'come' and 'share' clauses fused together (cf. §9.5.2), in which case we have
no new information about how to bracket the na.
If na formed a constituent with the focalized constituent, it would be reasonable to
expect the two to occur together in truncated replies to WH questions. But na cannot
surface after a bare focalized constituent. This is shown by the exchange in (273).","[184, 185]"
"A semantically expected Loc postposition and Def di are often omitted with nouns
functioning as spatiotemporal adverbials (e.g. 'there', 'tomorrow'), and with certain
high-frequency nouns denoting socially significant zones, such as yoobu 'market' and
ganji 'wilderness' (§5.12).
Cognates of ra are DjCh la and KS ra (la after a nasal or liquid), and the
postposition may be ancient. Locative postpositions usually derive historically from
nouns meaning 'place', 'interior', or the like, but I can identify no specific noun stem
as the likely etymological source for these forms. If *ra is original, we should look for
a noun roughly of the shape *CVra, since tap *r does not otherwise occur morphemeinitially in native Songhay vocabulary. If *la is the older variant this consideration
does not apply, laabu 'earth, soil' (KS labu) is perhaps a candidate, but it does not
mean 'place'.
With kuna we have better luck. KCh itself has a frozen compound haw-kuna
'belt' including haw 'tie'. (Cf. KS kuna-haw 'belt' and HS kun-haw verb 'tie belt
on'.) KCh also has a reduplicated noun kuna-kuna '(the) very bottom (of pit, well,
etc.)', and a frozen instrumental phrase nda kuna 'internally, on the inside' (§5.11.4).
These forms, and perhaps the verb kun 'be pregnant' suggest an original meaning
complex for *kun(a) on the order of 'deep interior, middle, womb, midsection, waist'.
The bleaching of such a noun into a Loc adposition is natural.",[121]
"2188 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization(386a) illustrates the 'indeed' adverb-like sense, emphasizing the truth of the
proposition; note the (optional) Def di pointing to its continuing nominal status. The
other examples involve attachment to an NP. In (386b), jaatir merely reinforces the
strong word albarka 'power, force', but in (386c-e) it emphasizes the direct,
unmediated, or unassisted role of the referent of the preceding NP within the
eventuality. (For an alternative expression of unassisted activity, see bomo reflexives
in §10.2.1.) In (386c) we can paraphrase the translation Ί myself as 'even I (not just
others).' (386d) and (386e) occur in the context of an evidentially hedged second-hand
account of sightings of a dj inn-like dwarf; the speaker has heard about the sightings
but hasn't himself seen the dwarf (386d); the speaker has seen similar creatures but not
the dwarf itself (386e). In (386d) the constituent with jaati-jaatir^ di seems to be a
preposed topic constituent, and the following core sentence repeats the ISg subject
pronoun. However, in (386c) the corresponding phrase with jaatir^ di itself functions
as subject NP, which seems to be the more common pattern in the texts. In (386e),
the jaati-jaaticonstituent is in apposition to the regular 3SgO enclitic ga, which
functions as direct object. It appears that the enclitic cannot directly take a following
jaati(r), so an extra 3SgF pronoun is added. (386f) shows that the constituent
including jaati(r) may serve as complement of a postposition.
In some examples which appear at first sight to have a jaati(r) constituent
functioning as direct object, I suspect that the^'aa^'fr^is actually used adverbially with
clausal scope. Thus I use the model of (386a) to interpret (387).

"Appendix l
Upriver dialectsAs one goes up the Niger River westward from Timbuktu, the major KCh-speaking
towns are, in order, Dir£ (D), Tonka (To), and Niafunko (N). Goundam (G) is actually
a few miles north of Tonka in an area characterized by a few large seasonal lakes like
Lake Fati. Tape recordings were made in Timbuktu with an N speaker who had just
come for a regional cultural festival, and from three G natives (whose speech showed
some Timbuktu dialectal influence). After these were provisionally transcribed, I went
to N for three days to check some problematic words or phrases from the tapes, and to
do lexical and some grammatical elicitation. I also stopped in G on the way back and
did some lexical and grammatical elicitation there. The dialect from villages near Dire*
in the texts published by Zouber (1983) are close to that of G.
The following comments are based mainly on N. Lexical differences are given in
the dictionary, and minor points are covered in notes to the text collection. We note
briefly that there is very extensive Fulfulde (Fula) influence in N, and considerable
Tamashek (Tuareg) and some Arab influence around G. Most of the comments below
deal with differences vis- -vis Timbuktu, but some confirm Timbuktu features for G
and N where this seems useful in the context of comparative Songhay studies.
There are some similarities between the upriver dialects and KS, in spite of the
fact that Timbuktu intervenes physically between them. Timbuktu is the major urban
center in the region and is several kilometers off the river on sand dunes; most of its
inhabitants have little to do with the riverine economy (fishing, rice growing, boat
transportation). Some of the current population along the river in the area from Dir6 to
Niafunk6 may have originally come from the KS zone along the river, rather than
radiating out from Timbuktu.
§3.2. Original a is generally well-preserved in upriver dialects, in contrast to
Timbuktu, where there are many cases of full or partial shift toward ο and, more often,
e: talka TGN 'poor person', in Timbuktu also heard as telka.
§3.4.2. GN have some stems that may end in velar nasal rj, as in tag- tan 'push
off (boat)' versus Timbuktu tana, and dam ~ dag 'do' versus Timbuktu dam. Compare
KS (dag in Gao and points east, but dam in Bamba). Final nasals in *CVN words
tend to weaken to a nasalized wafter [o a} in riverine dialects including GN: mow N
'hear' (Timbuktu mom), now GN 'let, leave' (Timbuktu nan). There are a few cases of
weakening after front vowels: m GN Only' (Timbuktu nin) andjew-ndiG 'prevent'.
N also has variants with nonetymological m in such cases (jemdi 'prevent', nam
'let'), perhaps hypercorrections.
§3.7.1. The combination of 3SgS a and Impf go - ο is usually heard as o-o N and
as a-a G (like Timbuktu). Other combinations of pronouns with go ~ ο are as in
Timbuktu, including 3P1 i-i.

freely as 'get up and go' or 'set off. The point is that in general one arises from

systematically exploited in KCh than in English.
