"3Constituent OrderNganasan is a head-final SOV language. Therefore, complements and adjuncts
typically precede the head in a phrase. This order is present inside an NP and
in complex sentences as well. Neutral sentences always conform to the SOV
structure. This pattern is the most frequent statistically, but the word order is,
however, not rigid. The actual word order of the sentence primarily depends on
the information structure of the clause. (For more about this topic, see Chapter 14 below.) Sentence (56a) contains all constituents. As mentioned above,
the subject is normally expressed by null-pronouns, as (56b) it portrays. The
basic word order is displayed by the following sentences.

This grammar examines the Nganasan language, an endangered Samoyedic
language, which belongs to the Uralic language family. This description is based
on the materials from the Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC) which
was created as part of the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan
project (supported by the German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1, for information about the corpus see details in Section 4, Chapter 1). Most of the examples
are taken from this corpus and are passages from spontaneously produced
texts. Another portion of examples are elicited materials, produced either
spontaneously or in response to questions. Data which rely on existing grammatical descriptions (as e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.) are
also occasionally used.
Examples are provided in phonological transcription form with morphemeby-morpheme glossing. Morphemes are separated with hyphens, multi-word
categories in glosses such as ‘elderly sister’ are linked by a dot as in ‘elderly.sister’. Grammatical categories which are not expressed by a separate morpheme
are linked by a dot as in run.3sg. Nominative singular is never marked. Words
which are necessary in the English translation, but are absent in the original
text are bracketed, the only exception are the personal pronouns. Because Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, personal pronouns only appear in
sentences seldom. The Nganasan personal pronouns are not marked for gender. For the sake of economy, they are translated as ‘s/he’.
This grammar is intended to be a comprehensive description of modern
Nganasan, which follows the traditional structure. It consists of 16 chapters
and two glossed texts. The introduction describes the sociolinguistic situation,
a brief history, typological features and gives information about the corpus
used in this grammar (Chapter 1). The phonetic features and phonological processes are presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also deals with the phonological
and morphophonological alternations found in the data. Chapter 3 gives an
overview of the classification of the different kinds of words (word classes).
Morphological features are discussed in Chapter 4 (Nominal inflection) and
Chapter 5 (Verbal inflection). Chapter 6 and Chapters 8–13 describe the syntactical and some semantic properties such as noun phrases, types of predicates,
simple and complex sentences, verbal valence and evidentiality. Pragmatic
organization is shown in Chapter 14, while Chapters 7 and 16 describe the word
formation processes. In Chapter 15 some basic informations are given about the
core vocabulary. The reason for this is that it has traditionally been one of the
most neglected area in the study of Samoyedic languages. This description isxprefaceorganized in thematic sections. Chapter 17 contains two example texts with
interlineal glosses. One text is a short folklore text, the other text is a biographical narrative.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

Interrogative Sentences
There are two types of questions: one type applies a question word (wh-questions), while the other type does not (polar questions). The following types of
interrogative markers have been identified: special intonation, verbal inflection
and a special interrogative verb. The word order does not play a fundamental
role. If an interrogative sentence contains a verb, the verb obligatory takes the
interrogative mood marker. The interrogative mood suffixes are different in different tenses. (For more on the interrogative mood see Section 5.5 in Chapter 5.)
Verbless interrogative sentences are marked only by intonation.
2.2.1
Polar Question
Yes-no or polar questions do not require special word order. The word order
is usually the same as in the declarative sentence, but the order of elements380chapter 10is determined by the information structure. The verb can even move to the
first position of the clause or sentence, if it is emphasized, as in example (38b).
The subject is normally covert in this sentence type, but if it is emphasized it
appears in the sentence.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.123Verbless interrogative sentences have a high-pitch intonation pattern, the tone
peek being higher than that of an affirmative sentence. The following sentences
illustrate a fragment from a dialogue. There are two speakers, KH and KNT. Sentence (39a) contains a verb, but sentences (39c–d) are verbless.

KH-KNT_960810_Ngindjili_conv.046In the negative polar question, the negative auxiliary ńisɨ (40a), the negative
existential particle ďaŋku (41a), or the negative existential verb ďaŋgujsʲa can
be used. It can be answered with the negative existential particle ďaŋku, however in most cases, the conjugated forms of the negative auxiliary are employed.

TKF_041210_TwoNguamdje_flk.479Nganasan does not have special answer particle like Hungarian de or German
doch. In an affirmative answer, the particle ǝəɁ ‘yes’ with a simple affirmative
sentence must be used. The affirmative particle cannot remain unaccompanied

Wh-Question
In a wh-question, the question word replaces the questioned constituent. Any
sentence constituent can be the focus of a wh-question. It is possible to ask for
person, thing, place, time, manner etc. Question words are listed in Section 4.4
in Chapter 3. The following sentences illustrate questioned NPs, such as numerals (44a), adjectives (44b), and possessors in possessive NP (44c).

KECh_080214_EvilSpirit_flkd.017A question word usually occupies the first position in a sentence; however, this
is not compulsory. Nganasan is a so-called in-situ language. It means that the
question word remains in the position, in which a non-question word (answer)
with the same grammatical function will be located. Thus, the syntactic function and the information status determines the position of the question word.
However, the question word always takes the position before the predicate (Wh
X V order). Sentences (45a–c) are examples of a sentence with a question word
in the sentence initial position. It must be noted that all question words in
sentences (45a–c) can also take the sentence internal position as sentences
(46a–c) portray.

subject (O Que V) as in (46b).

KH-KNT_960810_Ngindjili_conv.043Multiple question constructions occur as well. These are built from two or more
simultaneously used wh-words. In this case, the speaker asks for two NPs. There
are some preferences according to ordering of question words: interrogatives
with reference to human entity preferably precedes interrogatives with nonhuman reference. Wh-word questioning location or manner usually follows
question words referring to human object or other non-human objects.

PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.1042.2.3
Other Questions Types
Similar to some Siberian languages such as Evenki, Tuvin, Nenets etc., there
is a special interrogative verb which cannot be used in a declarative sentence:
kumun-sa ‘say what; tell what’. The verb is historically formed from the interrogative stem ku- and the verb mun-sa ‘say’ and has a regular morphology. This verb
normally takes the interrogative marker as in kumuŋu, the interogtaive future
as in kumuntəŋu ~ kumunsuðə- or the interrogative iterative as in kumuŋkəə.
There are very few examples for dubitative and reportative interogative forms
as well. The verb can be negated with the negative auxiliary, has participial
forms and can take derivational suffixes such as passive and habituative. Question words are always missing from such sentences. The following sentences
show the usage of this verb.

ChNS_080214_Hibula.flkd.058Echo-questions are not typical for Nganasan texts, there are only very few
examples for this type. They are used, if the speaker has some doubts. Structurally, echo-questions are like polar questions. The following sentences illustrates this type. The second sentence is an example of an echo-question. As the
sentences show, the asked constituent is marked by an emphatic element.

Emphatic Use of Interrogative Sentences
The emphatic use of a question is typical for all Northern Samoyedic language
(Nenets, Enets and Nganasan). In this sentence type the interrogative form of
the negative auxiliary appears. This kind of sentence can express rhetorical
questions (52a), simple assertions, and assertions deduced from the context
(52b). The word order is the same as in the simple negated construction, thus
the auxiliary precedes the main verb.

Imperative Sentences
2.3.1
Positive Imperative
The imperative has its own marker in all personal forms (including the firstperson singular); but the most common form is the second person singular
form. The tense of the imperative sentences is usually the aorist (i.e. immediate future), it cannot be the past, but there are separate forms for future as
well. (For more about the personal markers see Section 5.2, Chapter 5.)
The verb of the predicate in the imperative sentence typically takes the sentence-final position, thus the word order in an imperative sentence is the same
as in a declarative sentence. The subject is not present in imperative sentences.

The negative imperative is expressed with the imperative form of the standard
negative auxiliary (ńi-sɨ). The negative auxiliary in a prohibitive sentence takes
the same imperative ending as the main verb in the positive imperative sentence. The imperative form of the auxiliary and the connegative of the main
verb together express prohibition. The negative auxiliary must precede the
main verb. In sum, the prohibitive structure uses the standard negative element
and the standard imperative strategy.

MVL_09ß007_Hungabtadja_flks.671The verb ŋuðasa ‘own’ also expresses possession. This verb can be used to
express an inalienable possessive relation. The relation between the possessor
and the possessed is stable in time and the possessor controls the relation, i.e.
[+stable time] and [+control] features can be associated with this relation. The
possessor functions as the subject, while the possessed is the direct object in
the accusative. This structure emphasizes the existence of the possessive relation. Such sentences are considerably rarer than the previous type; there is only
one example for this construction in the corpus. The following two sentences
show the usage of this verb.

Sentences are generally grouped into two categories according to the way in
which the relationship to the predicate is expressed namely: simple or complex sentences. This chapter deals with simple sentences.
The syntax of Nganasan has not been thoroughly explored. There are only
few works that have dealt with syntactic problems. In her monographic work
dedicated to the syntax of Samoyedic languages (1973), Tereschenko only enumerates the types of sentences which exist. In a grammar of Nganasan by the
same author (1979), semantic and syntactic issues are not considered at all. The
summary below highlights and discusses the most important questions, but it
is not an exhaustive account.
Nganasan is a head-final SOV language; however, head-finality is not rigid.
Word order is basically determined by the information structure of the sentence (for more detail see in Chapter 14). Head-finality is obligatory in phrases
containing a noun, such as possessive phrases (head: noun) and postpositional
phrases (head: postposition). Contrarily, in attributive phrases the adjective
can follow the head noun (cf. Section 1 in Chapter 8). Question words tend to
appear at the beginning of the sentence, but they sometimes occur in a more
internal position (see Section 2.2.2 below).
The most important grammatical relations are easily discovered in a sentence, as these are morphologically marked. An overt subject is not a compulsory element of a sentence; according to Holmberg’s terminology (2005)
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language. There are no general pronouns
(like one in English or si in Italian) in Nganasan.
Nganasan is an accusative-nominative language, as the unmarked element
in an active sentence is the subject and the agent. However, the object may be
unmarked as well, if it is in a third person pronoun as the inflectional suffixes
can refer to a third person object. Thus Nganasan in not only a subject prodrop, but also an object pro-drop language. The personal pronouns have the
same form in the role of an object and subject. (For information about the flexion of personal pronouns see Section 4.1 in Chapter 3, for object marking see
Section 1.2 below).© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_011364
1chapter 10Clause Participant and Grammatical Relations in SentencesThis section describes the basic grammatical relations in a sentence, with special emphasis on case marking. The subject and the object can be indentified
by a number of criteria, wich are discussed below.
1.1
Subject
As stated above, Nganasan belongs to the nominative–accusative languages.
Therefore, the overt subject of an intransitive and a transitive active sentence
gets the same case marker, namely the nominative case in clauses with finite
verb and with non-verbal predicate as well. There is no distinction between an
agentive and a non-agentive subject or human and non-human subject. The
predicate must agree in person and number with the subject (see Section 1.1.1
below). The grammatical subject of the sentence tends to appear in the sentence initial position, but adverbs and question words can precede it. Typical
subjects are expressed by a nominal phrase, which is composed of a modified
noun (1a), a simple noun, (1b) or a pronoun (1c).

"18chapter 1Nganasan around the age of 70 were proficient in the language, only 5.9 percent of children under 10 years of age (16 persons) spoke Nganasan. Although
the survey was non-representative, the data clearly show the status of the language. As passing the language to further generations has ceased among the
Nganasans, an irreversible process of language loss has begun.
Until the 20th century, Nganasans had closer contact only with the Enets.
Inter-ethnic marriages were only attested between Nganasans and the Enetses
(cf. Afanasyeva 1990); in these marriages, typically the wives were of Enets origin and switched to using Nganasan. In 1976, inter-ethnic marriages accounted
for one fourth of all Nganasan marriages: 21 per cent of all marriages were
between Nganasans and Enetses, and in the remaining 4 percent, the nonNganasan spouse was of Nenets, Dolgan or Evenki origin. After the settlement
of Nganasans, the traditional Nganasan–Enets relations loosened. Currently,
inter-ethnic marriages are more frequent, Nganasans marry Dolgans or Russians. Krivogonov (1998) reports that 56.9 per cent of women and 30.3 percent
of men lived in an inter-ethnic marriage. Children born to such a marriage typically speak Russian instead of the mother tongue of either of the parents, as this
is the language the parents use to communicate with each other. Therefore, it
can be stated that today the extinction of the language is an irreversible process.
2.4
A Short Typological Overview
Like other Uralic languages, Nganasan is a typical agglutinative language. However, many morphemes consist of more than one morphological meaning.
Thus, the language displays a series of flectional features because several morphemes are cumulative. (For nominal and verbal inflection see Chapters 4 and
5). Some morphemes (suffixes or clitic-like morphemes) are equivalent to lexical items in European languages. (For this morphemes see Chapter 16). Prefixation is absent. Nganasan grammar reflects many characteristics typical of
the Uralic languages, but also some unique features, cf. morphophonological
alternations (see in Chapter 3, Sections 7.1 and 7.3) etc.
The open word classes are verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs. These
classes can be distinguished by morphologic, syntactic and semantic criteria,
however adjectives are not clearly distinguished from nouns. There is a set of
relator nouns mostly with the locational semantics that take special (archaic)
markers of the Lative, Locative and Elative cases (See in Section 6 of Chapter 3).
Nouns are inflected for number, case and possession. They can appear in
seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, lative-dative, locative-instrumental, ablative-elative and prolative) and three numbers (singular, dual and
plural). Possessive suffixes convey possessive meaning; indicating the person
and number of the possessor as well as the person and number of the possessedintroduction19entity. Additionally, there is a category typical for the Northern Samoyedic languages, the (pre)destinative (see Section 5 in Chapter 4). Noun phrases display
the determiner and head constituent order. Possessive pronouns are missing.
The verbs have three conjugation types (subjective, objective and reflexive).
They agree with the subject in person and number and can agree with the object in number as well. Contrary to many other Uralic languages, there are three
morphologically expressed future tenses (general future, immediate future and
future-in-the-past). Additionally, Nganasan has two past tenses (past and pluperfect). Verbal stems are classified into two aspectual classes: they are either
imperfective or perfective. Depending on the aspect value, imperfective verbs
describe a present situation in the present tense (aorist), past situation in the
past tense, while perfective verbs denote the immediate past situation in the
present tense (aorist) and remote past situation in the past tense (cf. Section 4.2
in Chapter 5). Additionally to indicative, there are 11 morhologically expressed
verbal moods (imperative, admonitive, optative, interrogative, inferential, reportative, irrealis, necessitative, abessive, dubitative, speculative). Mood and
tense markers cannot be combined. Verb can be modified by a large number of
Aktiosart and modal suffixes as well (see Chapter 16).
As in many other Uralic languages, standard negation is expressed by a negative auxiliary, which is followed by the so called connegative form of the lexical
verb. For negating of constituent a negative particle is used (cf. Chapter 12).
Predicate possession sentences belongs to the existential type, thus the predicate verb is a special existential verb. However, opposed to the majority of
Uralic languages, possession can be expressed by a transitive verb as well. (For
possessive clauses see Section 4 in Chapter 9).
Nganasan is a head-final language and has a non-rigid SOV word order. The
word order in a sentence is motivated by the information structure (cf. Chapter 14). Determiners (inclusive possessors) are always left-branching. According to Holmberg’s classification, Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language
(Holmberg 2005, 2010), in which both, the pronominal subject and in certain circumstances the pronominal object can be omitted in a sentence. The
pronominal object of a sentence is only expressed overtly, if it receives extra
emphasis or if it is in a topic position (see Section 2.1 in Chapter 14). There is
no differential object marking, however the direct object of an imperative sentences can appear in the nominative.
Subordinate clauses are built with non-finite verb forms: participles or nominalized forms, which preserve the argument structure of the base verb. The
use of conjunctions is not typical. Coordination is expressed by the simple
parataxis. Nganasan, like other Samoyedic languages, expresses definiteness
not through articles, but by other means, e.g. with possessive suffixes or word20chapter 1order. (For more on the characteristics of the typology of Samoyedic languages,
see among others Bakró-Nagy 2012, 2006, Hajdú 1985 and Tauli 1963.)
2.5
Orthography
2.5.1
Nganasan as a Written Language
The first official orthography was created by the Samoyedologist Natalya M. Tereshchenko in 1986, but the alphabet was inconsistent and the system has
never been widely used. In 1989, a committee (consisting of A.A. Barbolina,
A.A. Momdye, A.Ch. Momdye, E.A. Helimski) was set up in Dudinka to eliminate inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the Tereschenko system. The final
version of the orthography appeared in 1992. The alphabet employs all the
graphemes of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet and the following additional characters: i, ÿ, ə, ң, Ɂ or ″, the last two symbols represent the glottal stop. The consonant /ð/ is marked by the symbol ⟨δ⟩, but it is often replaced by the Cyrillic
⟨з⟩ or the symbol ⟨ʒ⟩ for typographical reasons.
In sum, the alphabet consists of the following characters:
Ɂ (”), ə, a, б, г, д, δ (з, ʒ), е, ё (ѳ), и, i, й, к, л, м, н, ӈ, o, п, р, с, т, у, ÿ (Ү ), х, ч,
ы, э, ю, я
The parenthesized letters can be used for technical reasons, to replace the
preceding character. Although this is the official alphabet, its use is not compulsory. The usage of characters depends on the author and the editor of a
publication, mainly based on typographic considerations.
Furthermore, loanwords may contain any of the following letters: в, ж, з, ф,
ц, ш, щ, ъ, ь
1. The writing principles—as well as the characters—are adopted from Russian. This means that a palatalized or palatal consonant does not have a
separate grapheme as in the phonological Latin script (e.g. ń [ɲ] versus
n), but the palatality of the consonant is marked by the choice of the following vowel character: an “iotated” vowel (и, ё, я, ю) instead of ы, о, а, у
respectively, e. g. немы [ɲemɨ] ‘mother’, десы [ɉesɨ] ‘father’.
2. Long vowels are marked by doubling the vowel letter: маа [maː] ‘what’. If
there is a palatal consonant preceding the long vowel, the long vowel is
marked by a sequence of an iotated vowel and its non-iotated pair: няа
[ɲaː] ‘Nganasan’. Vowel pairs are as follows: я—а, ю—ÿ, и—i, ё—о.
3. The letter ⟨i⟩ is only used after non-palatal consonants. The grapheme for
a long i [iː] is ⟨iu⟩: miu [tiː] ‘the two of you’.
4. There is no separate symbol to denote the diphthongs [i͡a] and [u͡a] in the
Cyrillic alphabet, these are marked by the letter sequences ⟨ua⟩ and ⟨ ya⟩,21introduction5.respectively. The diphthong [i͡a] is often marked by the Cyrillic letter ⟨я⟩,
e. g. хяӈ [hi͡aŋ] ‘palm’.
The rare vowel sequences /ia/, /üa/ are written as follows:Latin script Cyrillic script Examples
ia
üa6.ea or иа
ёа, юа or ѳадиа or rarely деа [ɉia] ‘brain’
дюату, дёату or дѳату [ɉyatu] ‘s/he disturbs’The assimilation of vowels is often marked in Cyrillic writing. For example, the traditional буəзу ‘word’ [buoðu] form is replaced by буозу.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"
"1Word Order and Information StructuringNganasan is a head-final language, thus the statistically most common word
order is SOV, however the complements of the verb including the subject and
object can appear in several permutations. The simple intransitive sentence
contains at least two elements, the subject and the predicate. If the subject
is not emphasized, it is covert. Additionally, sentence adverbials can appear in
the sentence in the left peripheral position (1b) or after the predicate (1c), if any
adverbials appear at all. The following three sentences show a simple intransitive sentence.

pro-drop language, an overt subject is not obligatory in the sentence. The participant, which is already etablished in the discourse, if it is not covert, takes the
sentence-initial position. This position is the topic position, thus the default
topic in Nganasan is the syntactic subject of the sentence, the rest of the sentence is the predication itself.
The topic names the participant of the action/event, while the comment is
a statement on the topic. The topic can be preceded by discourse particle (2a).
The prototypical topic refers to a human [+human] and definite [+def] person.
For this reason, the topic is normally expressed by a proper name (2a), kinship term (2b), personal pronoun (2c), but the topic can be a quantified or a
simple noun phrase (1a–c) as well. In this latter case the topic is less prototypical.

"3Existential and Locative ClausesExistential and locative clauses are rather similar in general. Usually sentences
are regarded as existential in which the speaker states something about the
existence or non-existence of something or someone. According to the definition offered by McNally (2011: 1830), these constructions are specialized or354chapter 9non-canonical. Three major elements can be identified in locative and existential sentences: the entity (mostly an NP) about whose existence or location
something is stated (theme or pivot), the location in which the given entity
is or exists (locative phrase or coda) and the element (copula) connecting
the theme/pivot and the location/coda. According to the definition by Freeze
(2001: 941) or Milsark (1977) the entity, the existence or non-existence of which
is stated, must be indefinite in an existential clause, but it must be definite in a
locative clause.
The present section addresses the question how these two different types of
sentences—existential and locative—are expressed in Nganasan. As described
below, case marking does not play a role here—instead, the choice of verb is the
decisive factor in what interpretation a given sentence obtains. There are three
copula verbs in Nganasan: the “bare” copula isʲa ‘be’, the copula təisʲa ‘exist, be
present’, and the copula tənijsʲa ‘exist, be there’. One of the numerous interesting characteristics of Nganasan is that at least two copulas (təisʲa, tənijsʲa) can
be used in existential sentences. Both copulas were formed by the lexicalization of a pronominal stem (tə-) + BE verb (isʲa) combination, i.e. this structure
represents a grammaticalized pro-form for existential expression. The stem təappears for example in the pronoun təti ‘that, this’ and in some adverbials as təndə ‘there [lat]’, tə-ni ‘here [loc]’. While in English the pro-form ‘there’ and in
German the expletive pro-form (es) moves to the position of the grammatical
subject, in Nganasan the element tə can only appear directly before the copula, and other sentence parts precede this complex verb. This position probably
contributed to the prefixation of the pro-form to the verb. In the complex verb
tənijsʲa the copula is preceded by the adverbial locative form (təni) of the təpronominal stem. First existential sentences are discussed, followed by locative sentences.
3.1
Existential Clause
Of the Samoyedic languages, Nganasan offers the widest range of possibilities
concerning which existential sentences can be formed, namely, with or without copulas. In the existential constructions both existential copulas are used.
One is used to express existence in a place, thus this kind of sentences normally
has a locative (coda), while the other is used to express abstract existence or to
make a general statement. In the latter case, as can be seen below, a locative
element never occurs in the sentence.
The existential verb təisʲa ‘exist, be’ appears most often in existential clauses.
It is just as frequent in possessive constructions, but—as described in Section
4.1 below—these two constructions resemble each other in other respects as
well. This verb can take tense markers, so it can be used in past and future
as well, as in sentence (36b) below. The word order in sentences is coda–types of predicate355pivot–copula, which Freeze (1992) found in SOV languages. This construction is used to express existence in a place.

introductory sentences.

‘On this hill (there is) a tent.’
JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.004The constituent order in this kind of existential sentences is coda—pivot.
This, of course, does not allow for any speculations as to where the copula
would be, if there were one. This structure is probably used due to Russian influence. As for existential clauses in Russian, the word order is coda–(copula)–
pivot. The emergence of a parallel structure underpins the suggestion that
word order changes due to the influence of Russian. In any case, it must be
noted that this way of forming existential sentences is far less frequent than
the two other types presented above, and it only appears in narrative texts.
The pivot of existential sentences can be modified with numerals (number
determiners), number marking (in case of Nganasan, the plural and the dual)
and with quantifiers. Sentence (41a) below shows that a numeral can modify a
pivot without making it definite. The same is true for number marking, illustrated in (41b).

Locative Clauses
In a locative sentence, the existential verb introduced above (tǝisʲa) can occur,
but regularly it is the BE-verb (isʲa). In locative clauses, the word order is
pivot—coda—copula, but in elicited sentences pivot—copula—coda
was also accepted and used by native speakers, although in texts it appears less
frequently. Sentence (42) is an example with the verb isʲa ‘be’, while in sentence
(43) the speaker uses the existential verb tǝisʲa. In this sentence, the location is
not specifically mentioned.

KTD_NN_SeuMelangana_flks.1149In a locative sentence the pivot must be definite. Demonstratives express definiteness, as in sentence (42) above the demonstrative təti ‘that’ specifies the
pivot. Possessive suffixes can express a real possessive relation as well, and
make the entity definite, as in sentence (43) the 2nd person possessive suffix
-rə which attaches to the word ‘sledge’. A noun may also lack explicit marking.
In that case, the pivot does not carry any possessive suffix nor is it preceded by
a demonstrative pronoun; the interpretation of the pivot as [+definite] is only
based on word order and the choice of the copula. The following sentences
show such unmarked noun phrases in the pivot role. Both pivot–coda–
copula and pivot–copula–coda order can be used, however the copula
coda word order is not common in the corpus, but it appears in elicited data. It
is probably a Russian influence. Indeed, in a locative sentence, the pivot always
precedes the coda.","[372, 373, 374, 375, 376]"

in object position see Wratil 2013; for the usage of the objective and subjective

1.2.3
Predestinative Object
The object can be marked for predestinativity as well. In this case, the object
contains the destinative suffix (-Tə), followed by the ancient accusative ending (-m) and possessive suffix. The possessive suffix denotes the beneficiary or
recipient. If the destinative suffix takes on the theme of the ditransitive construction (direct object), as the examples below depict, the recipient or beneficiary does not obligatorily need to be expressed by lexical means, the possessive
suffix denotes it. In sentence (32a) the recipient is in the first-person singular,
and expressed by the possessive suffix (-mǝ), while in sentence (32b) it is in the
second person singular, and expressed by the possessive suffix (-rǝ).

Direct Object in Imperative Sentences
In imperative sentences the direct object usually occurs in the nominative, if
the verb is in 2sg or 2pl imperative form. This is typical not only for Nganasan, but for some other Uralic languages as well, as Finnish or Nenets. (For
Nenets see Janhunen 2002). From the present data, in imperative sentences,
the accusative case marking is generally preserved; only the 2sg subjectivesimple sentences377forms require a nominative direct object. In the case of 2sg objective imperative there is a variation: there are examples where the object is nominative
(33b), but cases have also been found where it is marked for accusative (33c).
The sentences below illustrate the shape of the object in imperative sentences.
The selected example sentences mostly have an object with a possessive suffix,
in these cases the nominative and the accusative cases are clearly different.

Other Arguments
Adjuncts are typically adverbials expressed by adverbs, nominal categories
with an adverbial inflection or with a postposition, or rarely bar nouns such
as talu ‘yesterday, tomorrow’ (35a). Furthermore, an infinitive can also function as an adverbial of manner. Adjuncts are optional constituents of a sentence. Locality, direction movement, place of destination, starting point of
movement, path (spatial adjuncts) and temporal relation can be expressed by
adverbials, a nominal category with a case inflection (35b) or by postpositional
phrases. Time and place adverbials tend to appear in sentence or clause initial
positions (35a and 36a). If there are two adverbials in a sentence, normally the
time adverbial appears in the clause-initial position.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.232simple sentences2379Basic Sentence TypesThis section describes the typical sentence types. A statement is expressed by
a declarative sentence, a question by an interrogative and a command by an
imperative sentence.
2.1
Declarative Sentences
Declarative sentences are unmarked. They appear in narratives, in dialogues,
as well as in folklore texts. The common word order in declarative sentences is
SOV, thus the predicate is sentence-final, but the word order is not rigid. Changing the word order does not change the sentence type. As mentioned above,
Nganasan is a consistent pro-drop language, thus the subject is not obligatory
in a sentence and under certain conditions the object can be also dropped. The
following sentences show a minimal declarative sentence.

tale.acc story-dim.acc tell-res-aor-1sg
‘I will tell the children a small tale, not a tale, a simple story.’
MACh_93_TwoTales_flkd.001The most usual order of the constituent in a construction with the verb ďebtuďa ‘tell’ is (A) T AD V, as in sentence (3c), but if the theme is topicalized as in
sentence (3b), it takes the preverbal position and the addressee moves into the
postverbal position. Thus, if the agent is present, it always takes the preverbal
position and always precedes the addressee.
The verb munuďa behaves differently. As example (3a) demonstrates, this
verb normally appears in the main clause, and the subordinate clause is its
theme argument, which is normally expressed as indirect speech in languages
that have it—Nganasan, does not (see Section 3 in Chapter 14). This verb cannot be used with substantives like sʲitǝbɨ ‘tale’ and ďürɨmɨ ‘story’ as objects. As
mentioned in Section 2.2.3 in Chapter 10, the verb ‘what say’ does not have any
argument, the question word is incorporated into the verb. (For the structure
see example (49b) in Chapter 10.) So, there is a semantic difference between
the two verbs and their argument structures differ accordingly.
Personal pronouns cannot take case markers and cannot be inflected in
the same manner as other nominal categories, thus if the recipient-like argument is pronominal, the speaker must use a different construction to code the
recipient. The oblique case forms of pronouns are replaced with postpositional
structures (see Section 4.1.1 in Chapter 3). In this case, the postposition ďa is
followed by the destinative suffix -Tə (-tə, -ðə), and by the oblique case form ofditransitive constructions399possessive suffixes: ďatə-poss and ďaðə-poss. (For the paradigm, see Section
4.1.1 in Chapter 3). The pronominal addressee is mostly covert; it appears overtly
only to express emphasis. The personal pronoun can precede the postposition
(4b). If the special interrogative speech act verb kumunsa ‘what tell’ is used, the
theme argument cannot be expressed lexically (4a).

JDH_00_Musuna_flkd.0771.2.2
Physical Transfer
The recipient of a verb expressing physical transfer is expressed by a postpositional construction with na ‘to, near’, if it is pronominal. It takes a possessive
suffix from the oblique series which denotes the person of the recipient. This
postposition is optionally accompanied by a personal pronoun. The recipient400chapter 11takes the preverbal position, and the theme is always placed before the recipient, but it is possible to insert another phrase between them. So, in sentence
(6a) the agent, and in (6b), an anaphoric pronoun is inserted between the recipient and the theme. The word order is Th R V.

Covert Recipient and Addressee
The recipient and adressee must not be overtly expressed in a Nganasan ditransitive construction. If the recipient/addressee is a pronoun, it may also be omitted. But if the recipient/addressee is pronominal, the theme argument must
take a destinative marker (cf. Section 5, Chapter 4) and have a possessive suffix
referring to the recipient/addressee (possessive strategy). Thus, in a ditransitive
construction neither the agent nor the recipient/addressee must be expressed
by a lexical element; a morphological marker can refer to them. The agent is
encoded through verbal morphology, with the verbal personal ending, while
the recipient/addressee is encoded through nominal morphology, with the possessive suffix showing the person and number of the recipient/addressee. This
construction is illustrated with the following examples:

KES_031115_Paris_nar.320The same construction appears in passive sentences. In such cases, the agent is
never omitted, and the theme argument moves to the topic position. The recipient is expressed with the possessive suffix on the theme. The verb is always in
the reflexive conjugation and, of course, it agrees with the grammatical subject
of the sentence, that is, with the theme. This construction may occur with the
verb ‘give’ (9), but it is most often used with speech act verbs (8). In sentences
wit speech act verbs, the agent cannot be overt.

JSM_080212_Mosquitos_flkd.1612Coding the BeneficiaryThe beneficiary is an entity for whose benefit the action was performed. As can
be seen, there is a contrast between the coding of the recipient and the coding of the beneficiary. As we have seen before, the recipient NP takes the lative
marker; for a benefactive NP this is not possible, and it can either be coded with
the allative or—like a recipient—may remain covert.
2.1
Postpositional Coding
If the beneficiary is an NP or expressed with the demonstrative pronouns used
as personal pronouns, the construction is postpositional and the postposition402chapter 11ďaðiɁkü ~ ďaðükü ‘for, for the sake of’ must be used. The stem of this postposition is the postposition ďa, the origin of the other constituent is unclear.
If the beneficiary is expressed by a pronoun or demonstrative (10a) the
postposition takes the possessive suffix corresponding to person and number. This construction can only express a beneficiary, if the NP has the feature
[+human]. In other instances, the postposition is either an allative marker of
direction or expresses the meaning of ‘for the sake of’. The word order is always
beneficiary—theme.

KNT_940903_KehyLuu.178Similar to the recipient, the beneficiary can also be covert in the sentence. In
this case, the destinative suffix and the possessive suffix indicate the person
and the number of the beneficiary, as seen in sentences in (11). The NP marked
with the destinative is the theme of the ditransitive construction. The agent
of the sentence is almost always expressed with only the verbal ending, if it is
overt as in (11c), it takes the clause-initial position.

ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.063When destinative NPs function as subjects of the intransitive sentence, the construction can also be qualified as benefactive. This construction occurs rarely.
The NP appears in the subject position and takes the destinative suffix (-tǝ/-ðǝ)
and the possessive suffix. The possessive suffix indicates the number and person of the beneficiary. Subject destinative NPs take possessive markers for the
nominative only. This construction is not very frequent, only 10 % of the benefactive constructions are of this type. Most often, this sentence type contains
the verbs tujsʲa ‘come’, ŋǝtumsa ‘become visible; be born’ and the negative particle ďaŋku. For a depiction of the structure, see the sentences in (12). This kind
of construction appears not only in Nganasan, but also in Enets (cf. Khanina &
Shluisky 2014).

ChND_041212_Girl_flkd.1413Coding the ThemeAs has already been mentioned, the theme of the ditransitive sentence in most
cases remains in the accusative. Passive sentences are exceptions; for more on
this, see Section 1.3 above. With imperative forms, the theme is in the nominative; for more on the form of the imperative object, see Section 1.2.4, Chapter 10.
The personal suffix of the verb may also indicate the direct object, thus the
theme can be overt under certain circumstances, as in (13a–b). However, this
is only possible, if the theme has already been indicated in the preceding sentences, so in the given sentences it would be possible to use only the personal
pronoun. In these cases, the personal endings on the verb are used to indicate
the theme instead of a personal pronoun. Normally, the agent in such cases is
also not overt.

ChND_080729_SevenNjote_flks.373There is another possibility to express comitative meaning. In this construction one part of the logical subject is referred to only by a verbal ending, and
the other part is an NP with the comitative postposition nanu as in (16a). As
mentioned above in these cases, the verb agrees with the logical subjects. If
the speaker wants to stress that the subjects (agents) acted together, the predicate must be in the dual or plural, depending on the number of actors. Sentence
(16a) is a sentence with a covert subject; only the verb ending shows the agent.
The use of plural is not possible in this case. Sentence (16b) shows an example of the NP in the comitative case. In the sentence, the verb agrees with the
logical subject, thus it takes the dual as well.

ChND, 2008Nominal categories are generally in the singular after a numeral or other quantifier (cf. Section 7.6 in Chapter 3). If the noun appears in the singular form
(after a numeral), the subject and the predicate agree grammatically, thus the
verb is in the singular (18), but if the noun remains in the dual form, the verb
agrees in number with the noun, as in sentence (19). After quantifiers such as
ŋukəgəə ‘many, much’, bǝnsǝ ‘all’ or numerals, the predicate agrees formally with
the subject, i.e. it appears in the singular (20).

is probably due to Russian influence.
1.1.2
Predestinative Subject
Like the closely related languages Enets and Nenets (cf. Khanina & Shluinky
2014, Nikolaeva 2014: 166), the subject of an intransitive sentence can appear
with a destinative suffix (-tǝ/-ðǝ). The subject of a transitive sentence cannot
appear with this suffix, instead of a transitive construction a passive sentence
must be use. This kind of constructions can be qualified as benefactive. The
possessive suffix appearing on the NP indicates the number and person of
the beneficiary. Subject destinative NPs take possessive markers for the nominative only. For this structure, see sentence (21), as the subject of an intransitive active sentence, and sentence (22) as the subject of an passive sentence.

Direct Object
The direct object of a sentence is most often expressed by a noun phrase, but
adjectives, adjectival participles or pronouns can also serve as an object. The
direct object of an active sentence is in the accusative, regardless of whether
the subject is overtly present in the sentence or not. It must be noted, however,
that this does not apply to direct objects of imperative 2sg sentences, which
stays in nominative. The accusative marking is independent of the definiteness
of the object and the conjugation of the verb as well.
1.2.1
NP in Object Position
As mentioned in Section 3, Chapter 4, the ancient accusative case marker (-m)
in singular has disappeared, thus in singular the accusative, genitive and thesimple sentences373nominative forms are mostly identical (23a–b). However, if the noun contains
a gradation consonant, the consonant gradation displays the accusative case
as in sentence (24a), in which the accusative form of the word bahi ‘wild reindeer’ appears. Sentence (24b) contains the accusative form of the word bigaj
‘river’. The following phonological processes have taken place: biKaj + ə +m >
bi.ka.jəm (opening of the syllable) > bi.ka.jam (assimilation of the epenthetic
vowel) > bi.ka.am (historical consonant deletion in intervocalic position) >
bikaa. Thus, the form of the word shows that it is not in nominative, but in
accusative. (For the morphophonological processes see Chapter 2: Gradation
is described in Section 7.1, assimilation in Section 7.3, while consonant deletion in Section 7.6.)

Pronouns in Object Position
If a personal pronoun takes the object position, there is no case marking on
it, because personal pronouns do not have any inflectional forms (cf. Section
4.1 in Chapter 3). Nganasan being a pro-drop language, the subject expressed
with personal pronoun is only seldom overt in a sentence, thus if a personal
pronoun appears in the sentence, it mostly plays the object role as in sentence
(27a) below, the subject is indicated by the verbal ending. The verbal agreement
shows the person and number of the subject. If the subject is emphasized, it
appears in the sentence. In this case, the word order is SOV, thus the subject
takes the first position and additionally the agreement clarifies which personal
pronoun takes which role as shown in sentence (27b).

PKK_71_OneTent_flkd.056The third person object is a special case. Theoretically it can be a personal pronoun or a demonstrative pronoun used in the function of personal pronoun,
hoewever the third person personal pronoun never occur in object position. In
the case of the latter, the pronoun is marked for the accusative, as in sentences
(28) and (29a). In elicited examples, the consultants accepted the personal pronoun in the object position, but they gave the demonstrative pronoun as a
possible variant as well. If the object is a null-pronoun, the verb is always conjugated by the objective conjugation as in sentence (29b).","[388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393]"
"4Possessive ClausesThere is more than one way to express predicate possession. Either an existential sentence or a transitive construction with the verb honsɨ ‘have’ is used.
This transitive type of possessive predicate is characteristic for the Germanic
and Romance languages, but it can also be found in certain African languages.
Among the Uralic languages, only Khanty, Mansi and Nganasan have a haveverb. Section 4.1 deals with the existential construction, while Section 4.2 describes the features of transitive constructions.
4.1
Existential Possessives
The copula təisʲa ‘exist’ is used in existential possessive sentences. The possessed NP, which is the grammatical subject of the clause, normally takes a
possessive suffix that agrees in person and number with the possessor. The
pronominal possessor does not obligatory appear in the sentence, because the
possessive suffix refers to it. Sentence (46) shows a possessive sentence without
a pronominal possessor, while sentence (47) contains a pronominal possessor
and the possessed entity is marked by a possessive suffix. The possessive construction can be modified with quantifiers, as in the examples (46) and (48b)
below. The word order is always (possessor)-possessee-verb, if the possessor is
present in the sentence.

‘This old Enets had a wife.’
ChND_99_Fire_flkd.0024.2
Transitive Construction
A transitive verb honsɨ ‘have’ can also express a possessive relation. In these
constructions, the possessor is the grammatical subject and the possessed NP,
the direct object of the sentence and as such, appears in the accusative. The
verb must agree with the subject, i.e. the possessor, in number and person.
The possessor can be omitted from the sentence as in sentence (50), since the
personal verbal ending already refers to person. Thus, if the possessor can be
referred to by a pronoun, it is usually not overt in the sentence. (This is a prodrop phenomenon in a possessive construction.) The possessed does not have
to take on a possessive personal ending.","[378, 379]"

MVL_080225_Djajku_flkd.007The occurrence of the destinative form in the position of direct object is far
more common than the occurrence as subject. The destinative/benefactive
form present on the argument of an intransitive verb also conveys a benefactive
meaning, as in sentence (60).

JSM_090809_Life_nar.267As the above example shows, the person of the benefactive/recipient is referred
to with the possessive suffix occurring after the destinative/benefactive marker.
Here, the possessive suffix does not express an actual possessive relationship. The NP is in the nominative or the accusative depending on the verb’s
argument structure. In the sentences included above, two semantic roles are
encoded on the NP:
(a) a beneficiary and patient;
(b) an agent and beneficiary.
The case marking of three sentences and the semantic roles of the arguments
are summarized in Table 4.7. For more on the ditransitive (including the benefactive) constructions see Chapter 12.

Destinative Irrealis
The destinative also has irrealis forms (dst.irreal). The suffix -Tətə(təə)ďəə
(-tətə(təə)ďəə, -tətəďəə, -ðətə(ðəə)ďəə, -ðətəďəə, -čətə(ðəə)ďəə, -čətəďəə etc.) is
built from three elements. The suffix -ďəə is the nominal past tense marker,
while the -təə- element marks conditionality. The first element -tətə is an obscured derivational suffix in present day Nganasan (cf. matəðə ‘the place of the213nominal inflection

childtent’ cf. maɁ ‘tent’). The meaning of this suffix is ‘something that needs to be
added to the referent of the stem to get the whole’ (cf. Gusev 2005: 17). The destinative irrealis forms are rarely used. The subject is marked by the possessive
suffix, but this is not compulsory, the possessive suffix can be omitted: tobəkəəðətə(ðəə)ďəə-mə ‘the axe that should have been mine’, čüü-čətə(ðəə)ďəə-mə ‘the
sleeping bag that should have been mine’. The usage is illustrated by the following sentence:

‘Why did you give him/her the coat that should have been mine?’
Gusev 2005: 16Destinative conditional forms can take all case suffixes, not only those of the
nominative, accusative or genitive. Sentence (62) is an example of a form in the
locative with an instrumental meaning.
(62) tənə tobəkəə-ðətəďəə-tənu-nə

Gusev 2005: 16chapter 5Verbal Inflection
This chapter deals with the inflectional categories of verbs; these are subject
and object agreement, tense, and mood. Derivational morphemes are not discussed here, for these, see Chapter 16. The linear order of inflectional morphemes is:
stem + (derivational suffix) + tense/mood marker + personal suffix.
Conjugation types: All Northern Samoyedic languages have three conjugation
types, namely, subjective (or indeterminative), objective (or determinative)
and reflexive-medial conjugations. Intransitive verbs are conjugated either by
subjective or reflexive-medial conjugation (cf. Section 3 below), while transitive verbs can be conjugated by all three conjugation types. As will soon be
made clear, the use of the objective conjugation does not depend on whether
the sentences contains an object, or on the definiteness of the object. Agreement between the object and predicate are contingent on the pragmatic properties of the object, such as identifiability or accessibility (more about see in
Chapter 14). Similarly, the medial-reflexive conjugation can be used not only
when the action is directed at the subject; for instance, verbs denoting an individual motion also often appear in this form. (See more on this topic in Section
1.3, Chapter 9.)
The personal suffixes of the conjugation types can express the following categories: (a) person of the subject; (b) number of the subject and (c) number of
the object (only in the objective conjugation). Subject agreement is obligatory:
the subject and the predicate must agree in person and number expressed by
the verbal inflection. Object agreement shows the number of the object, but
not of the person. For more about the object agreement and the paradigm for
transitive verbs see section 3.2 below.
Although aspect is a term mainly used in the field of syntax and semantics,
it is applicable in morphology as well, as aspect may be expressed by morphological means. Aspect is a rather important feature of verbs in all Samoyedic
languages, as the aspect of the verb determines the way in which personal suffixes are used in so called neutral tense (or aorist1), as well as the temporal
meaning of the verb (cf. Section 2 below).
1 This tense is called in Samoyedology aorist, but it should be mentioned that it is not completely identical with aorist in Ancient Greek.
© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_006verbal inflection215There are seven morphologically marked tenses in the indicative mood:
aorist, past, pluperfect, general future, immediate future and future in the past.
In contrarly to other Samoyedic languages, the aorist is not unmarked, more
precisely the use aorist markers (coaffixes) does not depend on the phonological properties of the base, but on the aspect value of the verbal stem (cf. Section
2 below).
The following non-indicative moods are attested: imperative in aorist and
future for all persons, admonitive, optative, interrogative (aorist, past, future,
iterative), inferential, reportative (aorist, future, interrogative-reportative), irrealis, necessitative (past, future), abessive, dubitative, and speculative. The
indicative mood is morphologically unmarked. Tense-mood markers are mostly fusional morphemes, expressing both tense and mood.","[230, 231, 232, 233, 234]"
"1Verbal ValenceWhen looking at sentences, it is not difficult to notice that certain elements
of sentences determine their own environment. These lexical items are the
regents, while the lexical entities that need to appear in the environment of the
regent are called arguments: complements and adjuncts. If a complement is
omitted from a sentence, the sentence becomes ill-formed, while adjuncts are
optional constituents in the environment of a regent. This section discusses the
argument structure of verbs, i.e. constituents and a description of which thematic roles and syntactic function must appear with certain verbs. The number
of arguments required by a regent is limited. Most regents require one, two or
three complements. No regent with four arguments has been found in Nganasan. Regents do not only require a certain number of arguments, but they also
determine the syntactic function of these constituents: object, subject, adverbial phrase etc. There are languages in which each sentence must have a subject
(e.g. English, German). Nganasan—similar to many other Uralic languages—is
a pro-drop language, thus the pronominal subject, and under certain circumstances, the pronominal object or recipient can be omitted from the sentence
(cf. Sections 1.1 and 1.2 in Chapter 10 and Sections 1.3 and 2.2 in Chapter 11). This
is possible, because verbal inflection must agree in person and number with the
subject, i.e. the person and number of the subject is encoded in the verbal ending as well. What is more, there are sentences in which no subject can appear
at all (see Section 1.1 below). In these sentences, the verb always takes the 3sg
inflectional suffix, but neither a pronoun, nor a nominal category can appear
as the subject. In most cases, such sentences have a weather verb as a regent.
Therefore, it depends on the verb, whether a subject can appear in the sentence.
Some regents even determine the morphological structure of the complement, i.e. they determine what case marker the complement must carry. Case© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_008286chapter 7marking is always language specific. In the following sentences, the syntactic
function (adjunct) and the thematic role (locative) of the bracketed constituents are the same, but different case markers are assigned to them by the
regent. The regents are: nənsɨďi ‘stand somewhere’, nənsuďi ‘stop somewhere’,
sʲeŋkələsɨ ‘stay somewhere overnight, put up’, and sʲǝŋkǝďi ‘spend a night somewhere’.

KNT, 1994Stative verbs (e.g. ‘stand’, ‘sit’, ‘spend the night’) usually require a complement
in the locative case, while verbs referring to the endpoint of a dynamic action
(i.e. the beginning of a stative action), such as ‘stop’, ‘sit down’, ‘put up somewhere’ require a complement in the lative case. However, it must be noted that
contrarily to Nenets not all verbs with an inchoative suffix require an argument
in the lative.
Two different lexemes with the same meaning may also require different
case marking. For example, there are two verbs with the meaning ‘be afraid’:
hiləďa- and hilʲiɁ-. The case government of these two verbs is not identical.
The verb hiləďa- governs the elative case, while the verb hilʲiɁ- governs the
accusative. If the case marking is exchanged, the sentences become ill-formed
(see sentences marked by an asterisk).","[304, 305]"

Sentential Subject Constructions
Sentential subject complement constructions are not numerous. The matrix
predicate is most often an adjective in the predicate position such as ńaagǝǝ
‘good’ and nǝŋhǝ ‘bad’. The verb in the subordinate clause is nominalized; it
appears in the conditional form as in (10). The pronominal subject of the sentence is expressed by the possessive suffix appearing after the conditional suffix. The dependent lexical subject precedes the conditional form and remains
nominative as in (11).

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.086If in the sentence, no subject elements appear, the subject is interpreted as a
generic or indefinite subject (12a–b). In generic statement normally the 2nd
person possessive suffix is used as subject marker, while in an indefinite constructon, the conditional form remains without possessive marker.

Sentencial Object Constructions
The verb in the main clause of complement clauses with an object complement
is mostly a perception verb or a mental transfer verb such as munsa ‘say’ (13a),
čenɨďi ‘know’, ďerusa ‘not know’ (13d), sɨnǝrɨrsɨ ‘think’, natǝmununsa ‘presuppose’ (13c), ďebtuďa ‘tell’ (13b), ŋǝðüsʲa ‘see’ etc. All these verbs are transitive
and allow a complement in the object position. Normally, there are no linking element between the matrix and subordinate clause, but in some cases a
conjunction appears. In this case, the speakers normally use the Russian complementizer čto ‘what’. Sentences (13a–b–c) show the construction without
any conjunctions marker, while sentence (13d) illustrates the borrowed structure.

KECh_080214_Childhood_nar.005436chapter 13The given list above is of course not comprehensive. It must be pointed out
that the speech act verb munuďa ‘speak, talk’ usually takes no complement but
it is followed by direct speech. For examples of this and a detailed description
see Chapter 14.
In addition to finite complementation, there are non-finite complement
constructions as well. Some verbs, listed in (14) and (15) are subject control
verbs, which have either infinitival complement or seldom the clause is headed
by action noun. The infinitival phrase has a covert pronominal (pro) subject
controlled by the matrix subject. All these verb are transitive, the dependent
clause serves as clausal object.

Posteriority
Posteriority (before X happens, Y happens) is expressed through the abessive
participle -məTUmA1Ɂa. In this construction, the imperfective action noun
-NTU form of the existential verb (isʲa: iču) follows the participle form of the
main verb. The subject/agent can be expressed by a possessive suffix from the
oblique series following the lative suffix on the nominalized form of the BEverb as in sentence (23a) or it is an NP in genitive, which takes the position
before the abessive participle as in sentence (23b). In this latter case, the nominalized form of the BE-verb does not take the possessive suffix.

3.2
Purposive Clause
Purposive clauses describe the purpose for the action mentioned in the clause.
These sentences are formally not complex. They can be expressed in several
ways. Primarily, supine structures are used (cf. Section 6.3 in Chapter 5). Usually, the subject of the purposive clause is the same as the subject of the matrix
clause, but seldom structures appear with different subjects as well as in (26b).
The matrix clause normally precedes the supine clause, but a reverse order is
also possible (26c).
The subject of the supine clause is marked by a possessive suffix of the
oblique series on the nominalized form as in (26a) or by NPs in the genitive
as in (26b). If there is no reference to a subject in the sentence, the predicate
refers to a general subject.
The most often used purposive adverbial clauses are marked by the supine
-NA2Kə followed by a possessive suffix. The nominalized form holds the argument structure of the verb. If the subject of the matrix clause and the subject
of the purposive clause are different, the subject in the purposive clause takes
the lative marker as in (26c).

the construction. This construction is not very common. The purposive clause

ChND, 2006chapter 11Ditransitive Constructions
This chapter deals with ditransitive constructions, a type of construction for
expressing three-participant events. Thus, in the present chapter the various
strategies employed for recipient and beneficiary marking are discussed. The
most common ditransitive construction contains three participants: an agent
(A) argument, a theme (Th), which is involved in the exchange of possession,
as well as a recipient (R) or recipient-like argument like addressee (AD). The
agent of the sentence is normally human or at least animate, but as can be seen
below, the agent is rarely expressed overtly. Regarding the recipient, it can be
noted that the inanimate recipient is lower in the animacy hierarchy; therefore,
it is usually morphologically marked.
There are two types of ditransitive verbs. The most typical verbs are what are
called physical transfer verbs such as mi-sʲi ‘give’, tǝtu-ďa ‘bring, give’, ŋuǝnǝ-sa
‘send’, mütǝmǝ-sa ‘send’ etc. There are two verbs which express the meaning
‘give’; however, there is no significant difference in the marking of the recipient
and the theme between the two verbs. The distribution of the verbs is determined by the recipient: with 1st and 2nd person recipients, the verb tǝtuďa is
used, while the 3rd person is used with the verb misʲi. (For more on this topic,
see Wagner-Nagy & Szeverényi 2013.)
Less prototypical are verbs of mental transfer such as ŋǝtǝrubtuďa ‘show’,
ďebtuďa ‘tell’, munsa ‘say’, munuďa ‘say’ etc. The argument of the verbs denoting mental transfer is not, strictly speaking a recipient, but it behaves like one,
it will be called adressee in this study.
Not only a recipient can be the argument of the ditransitive verb, but a beneficiary as well. In this case, the person denoted by the noun will get something
or is going to be the beneficiary of an action. The beneficiary argument is always
optional.
It can be stated that the prototypical recipient and beneficiary are animate,
but inanimate participants can occur as well. There is more than one possibility
for the coding of a recipient and beneficiary. The most common construction
is what has been called indirective alignment, but as depicted below, there is
a monotransitive construction as well. In the construction with an indirective
alignment (also called dative construction or indirect object alignment), the
flagging of the theme (Th) is the same as the flagging of the patient (P) of the
transitive sentence, thus they take the same case. However, the recipient (R)
is treated differently, so it must be marked by a different case marker. (For a© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_012395ditransitive constructions

Inferential
The inferential mood can denote evidential meaning: if the speaker does not
witness the event or action s/he is speaking about, but the circumstances suggest the event is taking place and the speaker is fairly certain that the event
took place, the inferential form is used. This mood, however, is more frequently
used to express an admirative meaning: surprise, doubt, uncertainty, irony or
sarcasm. The marker of this mood is attached to the S1 stem. The inferential has
only one temporal form, the aorist and two mood markers, one for subjective
and objective conjugations for one or two objects, and another for reflexive and
objective conjugations for more than two objects. Table 5.11 exhibits the mood
markers.
The following example shows the usage of the inferential mood expressing
evidentiality.","[267, 268, 269]"
"word classes972.1
Inflectional Properties
Nouns and adjectives can be distinguished by both their morphological and
syntactic features. However, there are some words that can function both as
nouns and adjectives, e.g. sɨr ‘white; ice, salt’, heŋkə ‘black, blackness’. Participles behave like adjectives. The following inflectional categories are marked
on adjectives: number and case, in the linear order of stem + number/case
marker.
The inflectional paradigms for adjectives and participles are defective, i.e. an
adjective cannot take all case markers, only the three grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive) and the number markers appear on adjectives.
Possessive suffixes are not attached to adjectives. If an adjective receives possessive suffix, it is used as a noun:
(4) əmə anika-Ɂa-ńüɁ
tuj-hüɁ
basuðə-gətə.
this big-aug-gen.pl.1plposs come-cond hunting-el
‘When the big ones arrive home from hunting.’
KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.047As for syntactic characteristics, adjectives can function as modifiers of a noun
head or as predicates. It should be noted, however, that occasionally nouns
appear in attribute positions as well, as in hu͡aa ŋanaɁsa ‘wood man—wooden
man’ [man made of wood]. The head and the modifier agree only partially. (For
more detail, see Section 1 in Chapter 8.) If the adjective is a modifier of a predicative noun, it agrees in number and person with the noun, as in sentence
(5). The predicative use of adjectives (attribution) is described in Section 2.1 in
Chapter 9.

Adjectival Word-Formation
Most adjectives are derived from verbs and nouns, but there are some underived adjectives as well: nəŋhə ‘wrong, bad’, bahi͡a ‘bad, ugly’, lʲisʲü ‘lazy’, čeru
‘narrow’, ərəkərə ‘beautiful’, məŋkə ‘poor’, ŋilʲə ‘own’, ďaŋka ‘slanting’, hɨlə ‘dangerous, frightening’.
The derivation of nouns and adjectives is rather different. The basic adjective
forming suffixes do not appear on nouns. Naturally, some derivational suffixes
like evaluative (diminutive or augmentative) suffixes may attach to both nouns98chapter 3and adjectives. In the following paragraph, only the most important adjective
forming suffixes are listed for more information see Chapter 16.
The most frequently used adjective forming suffix is the suffix -Kəə, however,
this suffix is no longer productive. Words derived with this suffix refer to a constant feature. The stem of these adjectives is generally bound and obscured, e.g.
təŋkə-gəə ‘strong’, kuntə-gəə ‘long’, ďürə-gəə ‘deep’.
Adjectives with the suffixes -kuə, -jkuə, -ŋkuə, -Ɂkuə refer to attributes. This
suffix is complex, the first element is the adjective and noun forming suffix -ku,
while the second element is the most productive adjective suffix -ə. Examples
are: ďabakuə ‘red’, sɨrajkuə ‘white’, ďerbajkuə ‘fat’, ńarajkuə ‘clean’ etc.
The derivational suffix -ə is quite productive and very frequent. The referent
of the stem can be a large variety of things: names of time periods, place names,
animal names and materials. A derived adjective expresses a property: ďoaku
‘sediment’: ďoakuə ‘muddy, turbid’; hu͡alə ‘stone’: hu͡aləə ‘stony’; kolɨ ‘fish’: kolɨə
‘fish-’; hekəgə ‘warmness’: hekəgəə ‘warm’ etc.","[115, 116, 117]"

Negative Possessive Clauses
Possessive sentences can be turned into negative sentences in several ways. The
existential possessive sentence type can be negated by the negative existential
verb ďaŋgujsʲa or the negative existential particle ďaŋku. Similar to existential
and locative sentences, the particle ďaŋku is applied to the aorist tense, and
it must agree in number with the subject. However, the negative verb is used
in all three tenses (see sentences 16a–b and 17a–b above), and it must agree in
person and number with the subject. This verb can take mood markers as well
(cf. 16c and 20b). This sentence type expresses that the possessed entity is not
in the possession of the possessor.

TNK 2008Apart from the negative existential verb, caritive suffixes can also express the
negation of a possessive structure. In this case, two structures can be differentiated. The NP with the caritive suffix can appear either with an affirmative form
or with the negative existential verb. The latter likely originates from the convergence of the nominative possessive presented above (Section 4.2 in Chapter 8) and the caritive construction. It is difficult to decide what kind of difference in meaning there is between the two constructions, some consultants
no longer distinguish between the two forms. The first structure is potentially
more tentative than the second. According to a native speaker consultant, the
first structure (NP with caritive + verb isʲa) suggests that the possessor does not
have any of the possessed entities at all (see 22a–b). The possessee, functioning
as the adverbial complement in the sentence, takes the caritive suffix. The copula takes the regular inflectional suffixes, and it agrees in person and number
with the possessor.

ChND_99_Barusi_flkd.007419negationAs demonstrated by the sentences above, this construction can be used for
both alienable and inalienable possession. In this sentence type the speaker
does not emphasize what the possession is, but rather the present state of the
possessor, namely that he or she does not have the given object at the given
time. As mentioned before, in this sentence type, the possession is the adverbial complement of the sentence.
There is another possibility to negate a possessive sentence. In this sentence
type, the possessed NP takes on the caritive ending; however, it is not accompanied by the BE verb, but by the negative existential verb (ďaŋgujsʲa) or the
negative particle (ďaŋku). Therefore, this is a case of what is called double negation, however, the meaning is not affirmative, but negative. The possessee never
takes on a possessive personal ending. The negative existential verb must agree
with the possessed NP. As shown in the following example sentences, this construction can be used for expressing both alienable and inalienable possession.
According to the consultants, with this sentence type, the speakers emphasize
that they do not own anything at all. In this construction the word order is (possessor) + negative existential + possessee in caritive.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.118Transitive possessive sentences must be negated by the negative auxiliary. This
is the less frequently used means for negating a possessive structure, there are
only very few examples of this in the corpus. The standard negative auxiliary
is followed by the connegative form of the verb honsɨ ‘have’. Tense and mood
markers are carried by the negative auxiliary.

Negation of the Non-verbal Predicate
Negation in sentences with a non-verbal predicate depends on the tense. In
the aorist, the ńintuu(Ɂ) negative particle appears in the sentence immediately
before the predicate instead of the standard negative auxiliary. As the sentences
below demonstrate, in most cases the negative particle also takes verbal suffixes, not only the nominal constituents of the predicate (see sentence 25a). It
can occur that either the negative particle or the nominal part does not take the
verbal suffixes in this construction. This happens relatively often in more careless speech meaning, if the speaker speaks quickly. If there is a possessive suffix
on the nominal predicate, only the negative particle takes the verbal inflections, as in sentence (25c) below.

JA_0609_TwoTents_flkd.254If the sentence is not in the aorist, the negative auxiliary must be used, because
the negative particle cannot have both the tense and mood markers. The auxiliary takes the tense marker and the verbal suffix, but the connegative form of
the copula also appears in the sentence. Future tense sentences with a nominal
predicate are formed in a similar manner as in past tense sentences. Thus, it can
be stated that Nganasan applies the nominal strategy for non-verbal predicates
and that this is independent of the type of the predicate.

TKF_061025_SongOfATsar_flks.056In negative sentences word order is partly fixed, as the negative verb is always
followed by the sentence constituent being negated—in this case, the nominal
predicate. The negated copula must immediately follow the predicate in such
sentences, and these two form a constituent. In other cases, the negative auxiliary and the connegative form of the verb tend to appear next to each other
(cf. Section 1.1 above).","[435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

JDH_00_Njaakju_flkd.193Causative structures are used, if the sentence expresses that the event was
caused by something or somebody. Nganasan expresses causation by morphological means, i.e. not with the help of auxiliaries or other verbs. In this case,
the complex causative (factitive) derivational suffix -RUbtU (-rɨbtɨ, -rubtu etc.)
is attached to the transitive verbs. In a causative structure, a new argument, the
causer, appears in the argument structure of the predicate. The causer can be
omitted from the structure, as the inflectional suffix on the verb marks person
and number. An omitted causer is marked by parentheses below. Weather verbs
cannot take a causative suffix. The cause is marked by lative case, compare the
following sentences.

KNT, 1994The above sentences displayed morphological causative, in which a single,
derived verb expresses causation. Lexical causation, i.e. when a suppletive verb
pair expresses causation, is very restricted. Such an example is a verb pair
meaning numəďa ‘wake up’ and kitiďi ‘wake somebody up’. The corpus does
not contain a verb with the stem numəďa and a causative suffix, and the verb
kitiďi grammatically behaves like a numəďa + causative suffix word should. This
is illustrated by the following elicited sentence pair.

KNT, 19942.4.2
Detransitivization
Decausative structures arise, when a semantically causative sentence is
changed in such a way that the causer disappears. Typical decausative structures are formed by medial and perception verbs. In case of medial verbs,
generally, transitive verbs are used medially. There is no derivational difference
between causative–medial verb pairs; they only differ in their inflection properties (see also Section 3 in Chapter 5). The same verbs in medial usage take
the inflectional suffixes of the reflexive conjugation, while transitive verbs have
two arguments, and take the inflectional suffixes either of the subjective or of
the objective conjugation. The direct object of a transitive verb becomes the
subject of the medial verb. The following sentence pair shows the use of medialtransitive verbs.

JSM_090809_Life_nar.356chapter 8The Structure of the Noun Phrase
This chapter discusses the structure and the major function of a noun phrase
(NP). The most common noun phrase is comprised of a single noun. Pronouns
can also serve as the head of an NP, but these cannot be modified. Pre-modifiers
can be of the following categories: adjective, demonstratives, indefinites, quantifiers, personal pronoun (serving as a possessive pronoun) numeral, and relative clauses. The relative clause is discussed in Section 4 of Chapter 13.
A noun phrase is typically head-final: it is composed of an optional premodifier and a noun head, thus the basic structure of the noun phrase is as
follows: (det)-(num/quant)-(adj)-noun. In some cases, the modifier follows the head (see Section 1 below).
The core syntactical functions of the NP is to express the subject or object
in a sentence, but they can be marked denoting various oblique cases and they
occur as well as the argument of postpositions. An NP can serve as a predicate of
a sentence as well. This sentence type is discussed among the non-verbal predicates in Chapter 9, Section 2. In the sections below, NPs are discussed according
to their modifier.","[324, 325, 326, 327]"
"discourse organization457Sentence (3a) immediately precedes sentence (3b) in the text. This sentence
introduces a new participant in the event (latǝǝ ‘bone’). In the following sentence, this participant became established, thus the topic of the sentence (3b).
Topics are often made definite by possessive suffix without possessive meaning as in (2b), by the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘that, this’ as in (3b) or by
the proximal demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’.

sentence, while the woman is the participant of the story, who is re-activated
in this sentence.
When the introduced topic is already definite, it is possible to make the second mention whit a personal pronoun, but in such cases the topic most often is
referred by simple verbal ending. In sentence (4a) the topic is given and active,
thus it is only referred to by a personal ending. The subject of the sentence is
covert. In sentence (4b) the topic is re-activated and expressed by the personal
pronoun.

MACh_940808_DogLake_flkd.002The new information typically takes the position before the VP. The following
sentence pair shows the ordering of the new and old (or given) information. As
has been described, Nganasan follows so called given-before-new principle. In
sentence (6a) the new information is the tree (muŋku). This participant is the
given information in sentence (6b). This means that the speaker first states the
known element, then the new information is usually given before the verb.

ASS_161023_Fox_flkd.004The question words normally appear pre-verbally, but they not obligatory stay
immediately before a verb. They often take, though not obligatorily, the sentence-initial position as well. The answer to a question-word question obligatorily contains new information, which normally takes the preverbal position.
Question words can be associated pragmatically with the focus. This suggests
that the focus position is before the verb. The following sentence pairs are whquestions and their answers.

sub-clause. The verb in the main clause takes the irrealis mood marker. In the
following sentence, the subjects are not the same, thus the converb takes the
possessive suffix, and the main verb agrees with the subject of the main clause.
In both clauses the subjects are dropped, thus only the converbal and verbal

MDN_97_War2_nar.0284Relative ClausesRelative clauses are clauses that modify the NP in the sentence, those realized
as a complex sentence are quite rare. These relations are rather encoded by
participle constructions in which the participle is the attributive complement
of an NP. Generally, Nganasan uses prenominal relative (or restricting) clauses
(RelN structure), however it is also possible to place the head before the relative clause, compare sentences (45a–b). The participle keeps the argument
structure of the verb, and these complements precede the participle itself. Almost all kinds of participles (cf. Section 6.2 in Chapter 5 on participles) canclause combining453appear in the relative clause. Nganasan does not use a relativizer like English
that. Differing from English, for example, where the relative pronoun can, but
must not be used: The beer I drank was good vs. The beer that I drank was good,
Nganasan does not have relative pronouns. The relative clause does not contain an overt element (relativized NP or R-element) which is co-referential with
the head, thus Nganasan belongs to the languages, which use the common gap
strategy. As the sentences below display, direct object (45a), subject (45b) and
indirect object (45c) can be relativized. Sentences with the present participle
express simultaneity (45c–d). The structure with a past participle expresses antecedence: the action expressed by the participle precedes the action described
by the main clause. The subjects of the two structures need not be the same. In
sentences (45a) and (45c) below, the subjects of the clauses are different.

This chapter contains phenomena which are part of discourse pragmatics. The
main areas to be dealt with here are pragmatic organization of text, type of discourse reference (such as pronouns and verbal cross reference), and direct and
indirect speech.","[470, 471, 472, 473, 474]"
"1Verbal PredicationThe most common distinction between verbal predicates is their simplicity.
The verbal predicate usually is simple. Complex predicates consist of an auxiliary and a lexical verb. There are only few auxiliary verbs, one of these auxiliaries is the negation auxiliary, which serves to form standard negation and
appears most often in complex verbal predicates. Other auxiliaries are semantically not empty, but they have an additional, mostly modal meaning. In this
section, only examples for the usage of auxiliary konɨďi ‘go away’ are given. For
a detailed description of auxiliaries see Section 3.3 in Chapter 3, for negation
see Chapter 12.
The auxiliary verb konɨďi ‘go away’ appears only in essive or resultativetranslative constructions. In these constructions an NP is followed by the infinitive form (converb1) of the BE-verb (isʲa) and the conjugated form of the auxiliary. Word order variations are not allowed. Contrary to Enets and Nenets,
the infinitive/converb construction wasn’t grammaticalized as the essive case.
This form has word stress of its own, and it never undergoes cliticization. The
following examples show this construction. Not only a noun (1a), but also an
adjective (or participle), a numeral (1c) can appear as the nominal element.
(For a detailed description on essive construction see Szeverényi & WagnerNagy 2017a.)1 The converb and the infinitive are formally identical for infinitive forms see Section 6.1 in

Predicate with Subjective Conjugation
Subjective conjugation applies to all verbs. Some intransitive verbs, as ńilɨďi
‘live’, isʲa ‘be’ can be encoded only with subjective conjugation (cf. Section 3.1
in Chapter 5). Transitive verbs take a subjective suffix only in cases where the
sentence has an overt object as in the following sentence.","[353, 354]"

ChND, 2008If the pivot is expressed by a pronoun and the coda is expressed by an adverb
or question word, no copula is obligatory in aorist tense, as the adverb can take
verbal suffixes, as sentence (45a) shows, however the use the copula is most
common. In sentence (45b), the pivot is covert, the speakers use the copula
and the adverb does not take the personal ending. In past and future tense, the
copula is obligatory and it carries the tense marker.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.072Summing up, it can be stated that the inflection of the pivot element (theme)
and the word order play a crucial role in deciding what interpretation a sentence is assigned. Existential and locational sentences are differences in word
order: while locational sentences characteristically display the order pivot359types of predicatecoda, existential sentences prefer the order coda pivot. As shown above, the
position of the copula can vary.","[376, 377, 378]"
"264chapter 56.2.1
Present Participle
The present participle (imperfective participle) is used, if the action or property denoted by the participle and the action denoted by the main verb is taking
place simultaneously. The suffix of the present participle -NTUə attaches to the
S1 stem of the verb. If the suffix attaches to an r-final stem, the suffix-initial
consonants are deleted, i.e. the suffix starts with a vowel. In other cases, the
suffix begins with a consonant, whose quality is determined by the phonological rules. The following charts show the form of the suffix and give examples.

or as the predicate of the sentence. In the latter case, it takes the personal suffixes of the subjective conjugation (cf. Section 2 of Chapter 9). In sentence (76),
the present participle assumes the pre-modifier position, while in sentence (77)
the participle is the predicate of the sentence.

Past Participle
The past participle (perfective participle) is used, if the action denoted by the
participle has been completed before the action denoted by the main verb of
the clause, i.e. it expresses antecedence. The past participle marker is attached
to the S1 stem of the verb: -SUəďəə. This suffix can either be attached to a perfective or an imperfective verb: kuə-ďüəďəə ‘dead, who had died’, barətə-suəďəə
‘who had waited’, ńilɨ-ďiəďəə ‘who had lived’, kəntɨ-ďiəďəə ‘who had frozen’,
ŋuńüntə-sʲüəďəə ‘who had collected’.
The past participle can either be a predicate, as in (78), or a pre-modifier in a
nominal phrase as in (79a–b). As these sentences reflect, the participle can take
possessive suffixes, which refer to an actor of event. Thus, in sentence (79a) the
3sg possessive suffix refers to the dropped agent, who has found the people,
while in sentence (79b) it refers to the polar fox.

Necessitative Participle
The necessitative participle (called by Helimski 1998: 507 as future participle)
refers to an action that is to be fulfilled in the future. The necessitative participle marker attaches to the S1 stem of the verb: -ɁSUTə. The marker can attach to
perfective and imperfective verbs as well: tuj-sʲüðə ‘who is going to arrive’, basu-266chapter 5Ɂsutə ‘who is going to hunt’, tərəu-Ɂsutə ‘who is going to work’ hoðətə-Ɂsutə ‘who
is going to learn’. The necessitative participle is mostly used as a pre-modifier
in a nominal phrase. It should be noted, however, that the necessitative forms
are extremely rarely used.

ChND_061025_Haljmira_flks.149The necessitative participle has a past form, which is formed from the necessitative participle of the verb with the help of the -ďəə nominal past suffix
(cf. Section 6.1.4.2 in Chapter 16). Therefore, the complex suffix has the forms
-ɁSUTəďəə. This participle denotes actions that should have happened: tujsʲüðəďəə ‘who should have come’, melɨðə-Ɂsɨðəďəə ‘who should have made
something’. The form is only used as a pre-modifier in a nominal phrase.

Abessive Participle
The abessive participle refers to actions that have not yet taken place. The
abessive marker is attached to the S1 stem of the verb: -məTUmA1Ɂa. Both perfective and imperfective verbs can take this marker: tuj-məðumaɁa ‘who has not
arrived’, ńilɨ-mətɨmɨɁa ‘who has not lived’, büü-mətumaɁa ‘who has not gone
away’, kəntɨ-mətɨmaɁa ‘the one that has not been frozen’, hoðətə-məðumaɁa
‘who has not learnt’. This form can take an attributive or predicative position.

KSM_080804_Village_nar.026The past form of the abessive participle is formed with the help of the -ďəə
nominal past suffix (cf. Section 6.1.4.2 in Chapter 16) attached to the abessive
participle, therefore the complex suffix attached to the S1 stem of the verb is
-məTUmA1Ɂaďəə: kotu-mətumaɁa-ďəə ‘who had not been killed’. This participle is rarely used. There are no examples for this form in the corpus.
6.2.5
Passive Participle
The marker of the passive participle attaches to the S1 stem of a transitive verb,
it is always of the form -məə: ďebtu-məə ‘[the one] told’, kotu-məə ‘[the one]
killed’, čii-məə ‘[the one] hidden’, sočələ-məə ‘[the one] sewn’, biri͡amtɨ-məə ‘[the
one] injured’. It can either take the attributive or the predicate position. Sentence (83b) shows the participle in the pre-modifier position, while in sentence
(83a) it functions as a predicate.

Iterative Participle
The marker for the iterative participle is -KUTə, which is attached to the S1 stem
of the verb. It can be used with perfective and imperfective verbs as well with
the meaning ‘usually do anything, do anything with pleasure’: basu-gutə ‘who
hunts with pleasure’, hu͡aŋku-gutə ‘who drinks with pleasure’, laŋür-kutə ‘who
often shouts’, ŋəjbəu-gutə ‘who loves to work’. The following sentences show
the usage. The participle can take the attribute as well as the predicate position.

Supine Forms
The supine (or purposive converb) is used to form a clause of purpose (cf. Section 3.2 in Chapter 13). The agent of the sentence/act is mostly marked by a
possessive suffix attaching to oblique cases on the supine form of the verb.
There are three kinds of supine forms.
6.3.1
Supine with -nA2Kə
The marker -nA2Kə (-nakə, -nagə, -ni͡akə, -ni͡agə) attaches to the S1 stem of the
verb, and the arising form appears in positive sentences. In negative sentences,
it attaches to the negative auxiliary, as the sentence (86b) below illustrates. The
agent is marked by an oblique form of the possessive suffix following the supine
marker: hoðətə-nagə-nuɁ ‘in order that we learn’, basu-nakə-nə ‘in order that I
hunt’.

The second supine form has the marker -ɁsA2 (-Ɂsa, -Ɂsi͡a), which is attached to
the S1 stem of the verb. It is used in positive sentences: kačəmə-Ɂsa-ti ‘in order
that the two of them can see’. In negative counterpart the suffix is attached to
the negative auxiliary as in (87b).

MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.114The difference between the usages of the two supine forms, presented above, is
not really clear. Gusev (2005: 23) claims that the two kinds of supine constructions and the action noun with the suffix -bsa are interchangeable. However, it
must be noted, that there is not enough material to prove or disprove Gusev’s
statement.
6.3.3
Negative Supine
This form arise through attaching the marker -mUNKəCTə (-muŋkətə, -mɨŋkətə,
-müŋkətə, -miŋkətə, -muŋgətə, -mɨŋgətə, -müŋgətə, -miŋgətə) to the S1 stem of the270chapter 5verb. This is a complex suffix made up of the action noun forming suffix -mUN(see Section 6.1.2.1 in Chapter 16) and the elative suffix (-KǝCTǝ): ńijku-muŋgətə
‘in order not to sweat’, büü-müŋkətətə ‘in order that you will not go’, ďorələmuŋkətə ‘in order that s/he will not start to cry’. The agent is again marked by a
possessive suffix from the oblique series following the marker. As we have above
seen, negative supine can be expressed by the supine form of the negative auxiliary. The two constructions are synonymous. The negative supine form is only
sporadically attested in texts.

Temporal-Conditional Converbs
All Northern Samoyedic languages have a temporal-conditional nominalized
forms.5 Two types of temporal-conditional converb exist: one refers to condition in the present; the other one refers to the future. Both are formed from the
S1 stem of the verb. Additionally, there is a periphrastic construction composed
of the present conditional form of the BE-verb and the future or past form of
the lexical verb: təi-sʲüə i-hüɁ ‘if it was/existed’, mi-sʲiə ihüɁ ‘if s/he gave’, ńilɨ-ďiə
i-hüɁ ‘if s/he will live’. The markers are presented in chart (89) below:5 For Enets see Siegl 2013b: 326–327, for Nenets Nikolaeva 2014: 110–113.","[282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289]"
"Acknowledgments
Work on this book took its first concrete form in 2006 during my work with
Zuszsa Várnai, Sándor Szeverényi, Nóra Wenszky and Attila Novák on the Nganasan morphological analyzer within the Project “Morphological analyzer of
Nganasan” supported by Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary, project
number K60807). Thanks to my fabulous colleagues, I learned very much not
only about the Nganasan phonology and grammar, but about grammar writing in general. My ideas came to a final formulation during my works with
Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev and Sándor Szeverényi on a Nganasan corpus.
This project was supported by the Deutsche Forschungesgemeinschaft (DFG,
Germany, project number WA 3153/2–1).
I would like to thank here all persons who helped me to complete my study
on Nganasan. First, I wish to thank Tibor Mikola and Eugen Helimski, who first
introduced me to the Nganasan language and culture and who made my first
fieldwork trips to the Taimyr Peninsula possible. My fieldwork opportunities
were supported by a grant from Soros Foundation awarded to me in 1996, the
Hungarian Research Grant (OTKA, Hungary) awarded to me in 2007, a project
grant from Fonds zur Förderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF, Austria) awarded to Johanna Laakso in 2008, and a project grant from the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Germany).
Very special thanks go to my colleagues, Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev,
Oksana Dobzhanskaya, and Alexandre Arkhipov, who helped me to organize
the expeditions and who helped me during my fieldworks.
I also thank my colleagues Maria Brykina, Valentin Gusev, Jean-Luc Lambert,
Zsuzsa Várnai, Oksana Dobzhanskaya and Sándor Szeverényi for sharing with
me their field recordings and permitting me to continue researching.
My gratitude also goes to Anna Fenyvesi, Gerrit Jawinsky, Hannah Wegener
and Alexander David Curtis for reading and correcting the manuscript of this
book. I would like to thank Marianne Bakró-Nagy, Valentin Gusev, Gerson
Klumpp and Sándor Szeverényi, who commented on the previous versions of
this grammar. Their remarks were helpful for my work. I would also like to thank
Brill: my work with the staff of the publisher has been very pleasant at all stages
of the production of this book.
Of course, my deepest gratitude goes to my consultants in Usť-Avam, Volochanka and Dudinka. Special thanks are due to my parents, to my daughter and
to my husband for their understanding, patience and emotional support.

This chapter summarizes basic facts about the Nganasan and provides an
overview of the history of the Nganasan people (Section 1). Basic information
about genealogical affiliation, dialects, sociolinguistic status of the language
and the typological profile are described in Section 2. Section 2.5 presents the
Cyrillic orthography as well as the writing system used in this volume. Section
3 provides an overview of previous works on Nganasan and describes the language data used in this grammar.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"The sounds denoted by ť [c] and č [t͡ʃ ] occur in free variation in the language, thus either of them can be used in writing. In this volume, usually
⟨č⟩ is used.
The correspondence rules between the Cyrillic-based orthography and the
phonological transcription are shown below.

Overview of Previous Works
The first attestations of the Nganasan language are relatively late. The first
word list, which sporadically contains some Nganasan material was compiled
by the English travelling merchant Richard James in 1618–1620. However, in
his notes James does not explicitly mention the Nganasans. Daniel Gottlieb
Messerschmidt (1685–1735) was the first to document words in the 18th century. Not earlier than a century later, in 1823, this material was made available to the public in the work Asia Polyglotta by Julius Klapproth (1783–1835).
Also, a few Nganasan words can be found in the book Das Nord-Ostliche Theil
von Europa und Asia (1730) by the Swedish officer Philipp Johann Strahlenberg, who collected data from different languages during his time in exile in
Siberia. This work includes a comparative word list in which the words of the
languages are compared to corresponding lexemes of among others, the Hungarian language. Gerhard Friedrich Müller (1705–1783), the German scientist,
who led a scientific group on the second (great) Kamchatka expedition (1733–
1743) also collected, among historical and geographical materials, word lists and24chapter 1a few sentences from several Siberian languages including Nganasan. These
materials, except for the geographical and historical parts of his works, are
unfortunately still unpublished (see Helimski 2001). The polyglot vocabulary
Linguarum totius orbis vocabularia comparativa (1786–1789) compiled by Peter
Simon Pallas also includes some relevant language data. Word lists of different
length and comparative tables are included in his itineraries (1776). Pallas had
also used Müllers materials. All these data cannot or, only in a limited manner,
be used for linguistic analysis.
The first systematic data collection was performed by the Finnish scholar
Matthias Alexander Castrén (1813–1852), the first prominent scholar of Samoyedology. Castrén made conducted expeditions among the Uralic peoples and
started investigating Samoyedic languages in 1842. His third field trip lasted
from 1845 to 1849. Although he spent only a few weeks on the Taimyr Peninsula, the Nganasan and Enets language material he collected during this time
is appreciated as an important milestone in the research of both languages. In
1849, health problems forced him to leave Siberia. Once home, he started systematizing the material collected, but his early death impeded the completion
of his work. His manuscripts were edited by Anton Schiefner. The work entitled
Nordische Reisen und Forschungen von M.A. Castrén appeared between 1853 and
1862 in 12 volumes. It includes a grammar of Samoyedic languages (1854) and
a Samoyedic vocabulary (1855). Schiefner has simplified the notation applied
in the manuscript and often refrained from indicating dialectal differences.
Nevertheless, the work is one of the most important sources in Samoyedology.
Castrén’s merit is highlighted by the fact that, for a long time, no progress has
been made in the studies on Nganasan. From the time after the Russian revolution, only the short grammar by G.N. Prokofjev, published in 1937 is worth
mentioning. This grammar however does not represent substantial advancement as it partly relies on the data discussed by Castrén.
One of the most prominent researchers in the second half of the 20th century was Natalya M. Tereshchenko (1908–1987), who was also an expert on the
two other Northern Samoyedic languages, Nenets and Enets. Tereshchenko’s
first noteworthy studies on the Nganasan language were published in the 1960s
(e.g. Tereshchenko 1966). Her monographic description from 1979 represents a
culmination and synthesis of her oeuvre. However, the fact that it completely
lacks a syntactic description represents a limitation of the monograph. This
also partly holds true for the phonological description.
Between 1968 and 1972, several scholars from the Duľson School from Tomsk
have carried out fieldwork among the Nganasans and collected grammatical
data, word lists, and texts. Part of these texts were published in the series Skazkiintroduction25Narodov Severa (Tales of the Peoples of North Siberia, 1976, 1980, 1981), but a
good portion of these materials still have yet to be analysed and published.
The Hungarian scholar Tibor Mikola (1936–2000) was the first to provide
modern linguistic descriptions based on his work with a speaker of Nganasan
in Leningrad in 1968. A very short grammatical sketch attached to the texts collected was published in 1970.
Substantial contributions to the study of the Nganasan language were made
by Eugen Helimski (1950–2007), whose work represents an important milestone in modern studies. One of Helimski’s most significant achievements
was the description of the system of complex morphophonological rules such
as: syllabic gradation, rhythmical gradation, nunnation, and vowel harmony
(Helimski 1994a, 1995, 1998). This was an essential contribution to the description of the language, as the above-mentioned phenomena had only been briefly
dealt with in the previous literature.
Even though several additional texts have been published since the publications of texts by Mikola, there is still little published text material available in
Nganasan. The collections edited by Kazis Labanauskas (1942–2002), who lived
in Dudinka for several decades are also noteworthy (1992, 2001). Labanauskas’
latest text collection (2001) was translated into German by Michael Katzschmann. Based on these texts, Katzschmann compiled a grammatical description
of Nganasan (2008).
The practical Nganasan-Russian-Nganasan dictionary, compiled by T. Ju.
Zhdanova with the help of two native speakers Nadezhda T. Kosterkina (1952–
2005) and Aleksander Ch. Momde (1945–2001), deserves special mention. This
difficult to access dictionary is a useful tool for language learners since it provides word base variants as well as additional morphophonological information.
In the 1980s, research on grammar intensified. Ekaterina Boľdt deals in her
monograph with nominal derivation (1989). Wagner-Nagy in her monograph
investigated word-formation in general (2001), and she compiled a text book
and short grammatical description in 2002, in which some essential point of
phonology, morphology and syntax were raised.
Syntax is a less well investigated area; there are hardly any monographic
descriptions in this field. After Tereshchenko’s monograph on Samoyedic syntax (1973) only the work of Kovalenko (1992) dealt with syntax.
Recently Nganasan language corpora with interlinear glosses have also been
made available via the internet.7

2008–2011) conducted at the University of Vienna two texts (of 583 sentences altogether)26chapter 13.2
Language Data for This Study
In this grammar, fieldwork materials are analysed which were collected during several field trips between 1937 and 2016. The transcripts are part of the
Nganasan Spoken Language Corpus (NSLC), which has been created as part of
the Corpus based grammatical studies on Nganasan project (supported by the
German Research Grant; WA3153/2–1) whose primary goal is to generate a digital, searchable corpus of spoken Nganasan. During fieldwork sessions, at least
two types of language data are collected: (1) elicited sentences aiming to clarify grammatical or lexicological questions, (2) texts and songs. My fieldwork
materials, which are part of the corpus, consists of data collected during four
fieldwork trips, carried out in 1994, 1996, 2008, and 2016. Altogether, I spent four
months in Usť-Avam, and in Dudinka as well as working with language consultants in Moscow.
The grammatical description in this volume is based on language data from
the Avam dialect. It relies on existing grammatical descriptions (e.g. Tereshchenko 1979, Helimski 1994a, 1998 etc.), language data derived from fieldwork
text collections, and elicited data. For illustrating grammatical phenomena, I
prefer to provide sentences from the collected texts over elicited sentences.
Syntactical and pragmatic phenomena can only seldom be demonstrated using
elicited sentences. As concerns these data, I assume a considerable Russian
influence (especially in the case of word order), which is a limitation of these
data. However, there are certain phenomena in the corpus data which proved
to be of little or no use. In this case, I use elicited data. The examples are provided with glosses and English translations. The glosses will be presented using
a slightly modified version of the Leipzig Glossing Rules (LGR).

Basic Information on the Corpus
This corpus contains materials collected by the following researchers or recorded by colleagues of the Taimyr Radio: Ekaterina Boľdt (1971), Josefina
Budzisch (2016), Maria Brykina (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009), Mikhail
Daniel (2003, 2004, 2006), Oksana Dobzhanskaya (2006), Valentin Gusevwere published [http://www.univie.ac.at/negation/sprachen/nganasana.html]. The project
was supported by Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Within the framework of the LangueDOC
project that was carried out in Moscow, 8 texts (comprising altogether 322 sentences) were
glossed by Valentin Gusev. Part of these texts are everyday stories, part of them are tales
[http://www.philol.msu.ru/~languedoc/eng/ngan/corpus.php]. Gusev published 54 texts as
word documents in the project Ethnocultural Interaction in Eurasia (2003–2005). The “corpus” comprises 14,928 sentences and about 28,000 word forms. [http://www.iling‑ran.ru/

would like to thank all colleagues who have shared their material with me
and who permitted me to work with them and to build a corpus from these
resources. The basic information from the corpus is given in Table 1.4.
The shortest text consists of only two sentences, while the longest text consists of 836 sentences (and 4,946 tokens). The first data was collected by Prokofjev in 1933 from Torunte Kosterkin (see Prokofjev 1937). This is the first text ever
published in Nganasan. The latest transcriptions are from 2016. Figure 1.4 below
shows the number of collected sentences per year. As can be seen, the majority of materials were gathered in 2008, in this year, two fieldworks were carried
out, one in Volochanka and the other one in Ust’-Avam.
The corpus consists of various genres: (1) three types of folklore texts (tales,
myths etc.): siteby, dyurymy and underspecified folklore texts, (2) narratives
(every day stories, biographies etc.), (3) songs and (4) spontaneous and stimulated conversations (topic not specified). The majority of the texts represent
the genre folklore, and it must be pointed out that two genres are underrepresented. None of these are songs. We have many songs, but this type of text
is unique and is not convenient for illustrating grammatical phenomena. The
other underrepresented genre is conversation. The reason for this being that
conversation is hard to record and very difficult to transcribe. There are very
few situations wherein the speakers converse in Nganasan. Figure 1.5 shows the
balance of the genres in the corpus.
The first and second version of the corpus has been already published (Brykina et al. 2016, 2018). In this study, I used the entire corpus, not only the published versions. Elicited data are not part of this corpus, but they are used in
the grammar.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]"

Negative Purposive Clause
Negative clauses of purpose are created by the negative supine form of the
main verb of the sub-clause, with the ending -mUŋkətə + (possessive suffix).
The nominal phrase typically appears at the beginning of the clause. If the
subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause are not the same, the
subject of the subordinate clause is either expressed by a possessive suffix on
the supine form, or by a nominal category in the genitive, or by both means, as
in sentences (32a–b).

meaning is the same. (See Section 6.3, Chapter 5 for the supine suffixes.)424chapter 12(33) a. təndə

Negative Questions and Their Affirmative Use
In negative questions, the negative auxiliary takes the appropriate inflections
and the main verb follows it in its connegative form. The question is mostly
dedicated to future and the negative auxiliary takes only the future marker as
in (34a). If the sentence is possessive or existential, the negative existential verb
ďaŋgujsʲa appears in its interrogative form, but it can use the negative existential particle ďaŋku as well. The sentence can express a real question or only provide emphasis. The negative element remains at the beginning of the sentence.

TNK, 2008The other type of negative question is not a real question; it is only used to
emphasize something. In such sentences, the negative auxiliary takes the interrogative marker, but keeps its sentence-final position together with the main
verb (SOAuxV structure). This sentence structure can never be interpreted as
a real question. Note that although the sentences below are syntactically negative, the meaning is positive.

Negative Lexical Words
There are some inherently negative lexical verbs and particles which are presented in Table 12.3.
The most frequent verb with a negative lexical meaning is ďerusa ‘not know’.
The positive conterpart of this verb is čenɨďi ‘know’. The following sentence pair
shows how the positive and negative verbs are used. The sentences below illustrate that the structure is not symmetric; negation is not simply expressed by
the insertion of a negative element into the sentence, but in the negative sentence the negative lexical element appears.","[441, 442, 443, 444]"

ASS_161024_Life_nar.015Negative purposive meaning is built with the help of the negative supine
marker -mUŋgətə. In this structure, the subject is also marked by the possessive suffix. The use of the negative supine is rare. Instead of a negative supine
marker, the speakers mostly use the supine form of the negative auxiliary as
(29b) shows. The two constructions are fully synonymous. The same speaker
can use both structures.

kind of construction does not copy the Russian structure, only the linking element appears in the Nganasan sentence, in the purposive clause the verb still

no contrast or topic-shift.
The present form of the temporal-conditional converb (see Chapter 5, Section 6.4) can also appear as a subject, but only in sentences with a special
meaning. It appears in sentences expressing general truth in which the pred-368chapter 10icate is an adjective with a predicative suffix (personal endings of subjective
conjugation). In such sentences, the converb form is an action noun rather than
an adverbial form. If the subject has a complement, such as an attributive adjective, it must appear before the subject and it takes a genitive case marker. This
word order is unusual, as the final position is occupied by the converb playing
the role of subject.

Agreement
The subject controls person and number marking on the verb, thus the predicate must agree in person and number with the subject. If there is more than
one expression referring to a subject in the sentence, as in “s/he with her/his
father”, the predicate agrees with the logical subject as sentence (13) shows.

case as in sentences (15a–b), only the head NP must agree with the verb. The
sociative suffix is of postpositional origin, some speakers still use the genitive
before it, as in sentence (14b).","[384, 385, 386, 387, 388]"

ChND-KES_061107_Dialog_conv.057As can be seen above, the negative existential sentence has the same word order

Negative locative sentences use the same negative elements as existential
sentences. The following sentences show the structure of the negative locative.
In the negated locative sentence the theme (pivot) element is always definite.
The only difference between existential and locative sentences is the word
order. In locative sentences the theme (pivot) takes the sentence-initial position. If the coda is expressed, it usually appears before the negative element, as
in (17c), but it can take the sentence-final position as well. This may be due to
influence from Russian as in (17d).

KTT, 2008The negated form of existential verb (tǝisʲa: təibəɁ) can be used in a negative
locative sentence. In this case, the negation is expressed by the standard negative auxiliary, as in the following sentence. However, it must be mentioned that
this structure is very rare.","[434, 435]"
"1Sentence NegationThe default way in which a sentence is negated is through the common negative
auxiliary ńisɨ, which is used in declarative as well as non-declarative sentences.
Section 1.1 deals with standard negation, while Section 1.2 describes negation
in non-declarative sentences. Negation of non-verbal, existential, locative, and
possessive sentences is discussed in sections 1.3 and 1.4.
1.1
Standard Negation
The predicate in the narrow sense is negated through the inflected negative
auxiliary ńisɨ in the negative phrase (NegP), which is accompanied by the connegative form of the main verb. In a negative phrase, the auxiliary always takes
mood and tense markers and inflectional suffixes and it agrees with the subject
in person and number, and, if the object is lexically covert, with the object in
number. The negated verb takes the connegative marker -ʔ, which is homonymous with the 2sg imperative marker. The connegative form of the verb isʲa
‘be’ is suppletive: ŋuəɁ. From a typological point of view, the standard negation
is asymmetric (cf. Misetamo 2005). This means that negative sentences differ
from affirmative ones not only in that there is a negative element present, but
also through structural differences. The paradigm of the negative auxiliary is as
follows.

attach to imperfective verbs (-NTU and -NTA1, cf. Section 2.2 in Chapter 5).
Note, however, that the aspect value of the construction depends on the value
of the main verb and not on the aspect value of the auxiliary. Thus, the construction ńindɨm tuɁ does not mean ‘I am not coming’, but ‘I did not come’408chapter 12because the aspect value of the main verb tujsʲa ‘come’ is [+perfective]. According to Gusev (2015: 107), in the Taimyr subdialect, the negative auxiliary can take
a perfective aorist marker (-Ɂǝ). However, there are only very few examples of
the auxiliary with a perfective aorist marker, thus this form is very rare. Sentences (1a–b) show a verb inflected in the common imperfective form, while
sentence (2) is an example of a verb form inflected in its perfective form.

KES_080726_Family_nar.031The negative auxiliary can take not only tense and mood markers, but derivational suffixes as well. The available data suggest that while aspectual and voice
makers tend to appear on the lexical verb, Aktionsart is marked on the negative auxiliary, as in sentences (5a–c) below. If a negative sentence is transposed
into passive voice, the main verb takes the passive suffix, as illustrated by sentences (6a–b). The distribution of grammatical categories is summarized in
Table 12.2.
The following sentences provide examples of the distribution. The most frequent derivational suffix on the negative auxiliary is the iterative suffix (-Kə),
but there are examples with habituative (-mUNHA), attenuative (-btA), imperfective (-NTə), and the resultative (-Ɂkə) suffix as well.

(For auxiliaries, see Section 3.3, Chapter 3.) If the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ- is used,
the main verb (in this case, the negative auxiliary) always precedes this auxiliary and takes the connegative marker. On the other hand, the negated lexical
verb must also take the connegative marker. The negated main verb follows
the auxiliary ǝku-/ǝkɨ-. This means that in the sentence two verbs appear in the
connegative form: the negative auxiliary, and the negated lexical verb.

The Negation of Non-declarative Sentences
As mentioned in Table 12.2, the mood markers appear on the negative auxiliary.
Synchronically, there is no separate prohibitive verb. However, it is possible thatnegation413historically the negative auxiliary (ńi-) and the prohibitive verb were different
(see Helimski 2004b). The prohibitive verb was documented by Castrén as having the form ńe-,1 but in the present state of the language, there is no reason to
differentiate two separate morphemes for these functions which are formally
the same (see 12 below). The negative auxiliary can freely take mood markers,
except for the abessive marker. The following pairs of sentences show imperative and prohibitive structures. The prohibitive forms have no special structure.
(12) a. tu-Ɂ

b. mətu-ðə
→ ńi-tə
mətu-Ɂ
cut-imp.2sg.obc neg.aux-imp.2sg.obc cut-cng
‘Cut it!’
‘Don’t cut it!’
The sentence pair (12a–b) above shows verbs with subjective and objective conjugation suffixes. The prohibitive sentences show that the imperative 2sg and
the connegative suffix (cng) are formally the same (-Ɂ). Furthermore, it is also
demonstrated that there is no special prohibitive suffix or special prohibitive
negative element. The imperative suffix is attached to the negative auxiliary.
The difference in the form of the suffix in sentence (12b) is due to consonant
gradation (cf. Section 7.1 in Chapter 2) and is not connected to negation. The
lexical verb is in its connegative form and positioned after the negative auxiliary. The sentences above also illustrate that although the structure itself is
asymmetrical, the paradigm is symmetrical. Each imperative form has its corresponding prohibitive counterpart.
The negative auxiliary can take other mood markers as well. The following sentence pair illustrates this with forms bearing the irrealis marker. The
declarative-negative pair shows that the negative auxiliary takes the same
mood marker as the main verb in the positive sentence. The negative element
is the standard negative auxiliary.

This chapter discusses the characteristics of nominal categories and provides
an overview of the inflectional classes. The Northern Samoyedic languages
display highly flectional morphological characteristics concerning case and
numeral suffixes: these are always portmanteau morphemes.
The following grammatical categories are present in the inflection of nouns:
number, case, and possessive personal suffixation. There is no grammatical
gender, and the animate/inanimate contrast also does not have grammatical
correlates. The linear order of inflectional morphemes is as follows:
Singular: base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+case/possessive
marker
Dual:
base+(derivational suffix)+(destinative suffix)+dual marker+case/
possessive marker
Plural:
base+(derivational suffix)+complex case, number and possessive
marker1Stems and Their FormationThe present section discusses what kind of stems suffixes attach to. Morphemes
(both stems and suffixes) may have an extreme number of allomorphs, far
more than is usual in other Uralic languages. The stems are grouped according
to their morphophonological alternations. Stem morphemes appear in three
forms, called S1, S2, S3 stems.
(a) The S1 stem is identical to the nominative singular form of the noun. This
stem type is not characterized by alternations.
(b) The S2 stem is identical to the genitive/accusative singular form of the
word. It can be also derived from the plural nominative form by deleting the
glottal stop. If the base word ends in a consonant, the stem is augmented with
an epenthetic vowel -ə. The harmonic class of the stem (see Section 7.2 in
Chapter 2) is irrelevant for the formation of S2 stems. If the word contains a
consonant involved in gradation, it occurs in the weak grade in the S2 stem—
a fact that can be explained by the historic genitive marker -ŋ, which has been
lost, but retains its presence in the form of an empty slot word-finally. The last
syllable of the genitive form is thus, always closed, allowing gradation to happen. (For the rules of gradation, see Section 7.1 in Chapter 2.)
© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_005177nominal inflectionThe S1 and S2 stem of vowel-final stems are often identical. Exceptions are
those cases in which a gradation consonant is present in the stem, which
appears in the syllabic weak grade in S2 stems.
(c) The S3 stem is formed from the genitive plural form by removing the case
suffix -Ɂ from vowel-final stems. If the stem ends in a consonant, the S3 stem
gains a connecting vowel, following the suffix harmony rules (e.g. -U: -u/ -ɨ/
-ü/-i). The stem-final vowel in S3 stems is often different from the vowel of S1/S2
stems. Gradation affects gradation consonants in the same way as it does in S2
stem. In the sections below, the different stem types are described in detail. The
following listing gives only the typical stem types:

Vowel-Final Stems
Stems ending in a vowel exhibit two kinds of alternation: consonant gradation
and vowel alternation. In some cases, no change occurs in the stem, i.e. the
form of all three stems is the same, but the most frequent case is that S1 and
S2 are the same, and the stem-final vowel in the S3 stem changes. Usually no
vowel alternation appears in stems ending in -i, -ɨ or a diphthong -ɨ͡a, -i͡a, -u͡a, or
-ü ͡a. Words ending in u- usually alternate, but sometimes the alternation does
not happen. Words with [+backness] value ending in -a usually do not alternate, while words with [-backness] value do. The list below includes words in
which the three stems are the same, meaning, neither vowel alternation nor
consonant gradation occurs in them.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196]"
"1NounsThe noun is the main subclass of the nominal category. Concrete nouns are
grouped into proper nouns and common nouns. Proper nouns are names of
persons like Simbi͡a, Naraaďə and geographical names like KoðutaɁa ‘Dudinka
(town)’, Mɨŋgasʲinaku ‘Old-Avam’. Common nouns include concrete terms and
abstractions, however, it must be mentioned that there are only very few abstract nouns, like ŋuŋkəðüɁ ‘quantity’. Most of the nouns are countable, thus,
they have plural and dual forms as well. There are only very few mass nouns
like muŋkuɁ ‘forest’ [wood+pl]. The nouns in this meaning always appear in
their plural form and have no singular forms.
Nouns function prototypically as arguments and adjuncts, but can appear
in predicate position as well. This characteristic of nouns is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 4. Nouns can be modified by adjectives and determiners as
well as by other nouns; for more detail, see Chapter 8.
1.1
Inflectional Properties
The following types of suffixes can be attached to nouns: case suffixes, number markers and possessive markers. The destinative markers also appear on
nouns (see Section 5, Chapter 4). The number marker and the case suffix form
a fusional morpheme in the plural. The suffixes occur in the order given below:© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019 | doi:10.1163/9789004382763_004word classes95Singular

or for locative cases:
STEM–(derivational suffix)–case suffix–possessive suffix
ma-ti-tu ‘in his/her tents’ [tent+lat.pl+obl.3sgposs]
There are two inflectional paradigms, nominal and verbal. If the predicate of
the sentence belongs to one of the nominal categories, e.g. to nouns or adjectives, it is inflected predicatively, i.e. the suffixes in the subjective paradigm of
verbal personal suffixes are attached to the nominal stem. Although the verbal personal suffixes can be attached to both verbal and nominal categories
(nouns, adjectives, numerals, non-finite verb forms), these two sets of words
can be easily distinguished. Verbal personal suffixes are attached to verbs after
tense and mood markers (1), while nominal categories are suffixed without
any mood or tense markers (2). (More about this topic see Section 2 in Chapter 9.)96chapter 3(1) kaan-a-Ɂku-mənu-ntu

Nominal Word-Formation
The most frequently attested type of nominal word formation is derivation.
Some of the derivational suffixes are only characteristic of nouns, while a part
of them can affect adjectives as well. The majority of derivational suffixes are
productive. Only the most frequently used suffixes are discussed in the present
chapter. As the examples in (3) show, there are six action noun suffixes, all six
operate on verbs, and act as deverbal suffixes. For a description of the phonological behaviour of derivational suffixes see Section 6.1.2 in Chapter 16.

The auxiliary kasaďa with the meaning ‘almost, nearly’ was described in traditional descriptions (Tereshchenko 1979: 261, Wagner-Nagy 2002: 151) as a negative auxiliary, but actually it carries no negative meaning (see also Gusev 2015:
128). The auxiliary is followed by the connegative form of the main verb. It
can be conjugated in all conjugation types. Sentence (7b) shows the verb in

sentence for connegative forms, i.e. it cannot appear as a main verb in a negative phrase. Examples with a derivational suffix are sporadic. As sentence (7b)
above shows, the lexical verb normally takes the passive marker. However, the
auxiliary can also take, for example, the passive suffix, which can even be followed by inflectional suffixes, and the lexical verb can also take a derivational
suffix. This is shown by sentence (9).

ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly, be unable’
The auxiliary ləðiʔsʲ can be classified as a type of negative auxiliary and translated as ‘cannot, be unable’, which is followed by the connegative form of the
main verb. The auxiliary is imperfective and occurs only with imperfective
verbs. It can take derivational suffixes (10b), tense markers (10c), and can be
inflected in the subjective (10a), reflexive (10d), and objective (10e) conjugation. Which conjugation is used depends on what conjugation the verb would
be in, if not in a construction involving an auxiliary. The use of conjugations
is discussed in Section 1, Chapter 9. The following examples demonstrate the
usage of the auxiliary. The opposite of this verb is the verb tukəďa ‘be able’, an
example is given in (11c) below.

əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’
The auxiliary əkɨ-/əku- ‘maybe, be possible’ behaves like the imperfective verbs,
but its paradigm is defective. It does not have an infinitive form, and does not
take tense or mood markers. Unlike kasaďa ‘almost, nearly’ and ləðiɁsʲi ‘vainly,
be unable’, this auxiliary takes the sentence final position, thus the main verb in
the connegative form precedes it. It is peculiar in that it assimilates to the lexical verb in terms of suffix alternation. (For information about suffix alternation
see Section 7.2 in Chapter 2.) It can be safely assumed that it evolved from the
particle əku (see Section 12.2 below). Thus, in principle, a process of lexicalization and not of grammaticalization can be observed. The auxiliary can be
conjugated by all conjugation types. The usage of the auxiliary is illustrated by
the sentences below.

ŋuəlɨ- ‘how can I not; of course’
The auxiliary ŋuǝlɨ- means something like ‘of course, how can you think I/you/
he will not; how could I/you/he not’. The majority of descriptions referred to
ŋuəlɨ- as a monomorphemic verbal stem (Tereshchenko 1979: 261; Katzschmann 1993–1994: 58), but in my opinion, the stem of the word is ŋuə-, which
is followed by the dubitative suffix -lɨ- and the personal marker (for dubitative
see Chapter 5, Section 5.11). It is possible that the stem is related to the particle
ŋuəlɨ ‘of course, naturally’ particle, but the direction of the evolution process
cannot be determined. The meaning of the stem ŋuə- is not absolutely clear, but
the S2 stem of the BE verb (i-sʲa) is also ŋuə-. Therefore, it is possible that the
dubitative form of the BE verb was grammaticalized as an auxiliary. However,
this supposition needs to be tested further.
This auxiliary is always followed by the connegative form of a lexical verb,
which suggests that ŋuəlɨ- is an auxiliary whose infinitive form does not appear among the data. This means, this is an auxiliary with a defective paradigm.
Although, there is very little data available with the ŋuəlɨ- auxiliary, but it is understood that, ŋuǝlɨ- can be conjugated in all conjugation types, though it never
combines with the aorist marker (-NTA or -Ɂə, see Section 4.1 in Chapter 5) or
other tense markers. This auxiliary cannot take derivational suffixes, but emphatic suffixes do attach to it, as sentence (12a) illustrates. There are however
only very few examples for this available. There are examples for the auxiliary
conjugated in the subjective (12a–b), objective (12d) and reflexive (12c).

konɨďi ‘become’
The verb konɨďi with the meaning ‘go away’ is also used as an auxiliary in
resultative and translative clauses with the meaning ‘to become something,
to change to’. It appears with nouns as well as with adjectives and numerals.
The auxiliary is obligatorily preceded by a nominal part of the construction
and the infinitive form of the BE verb isʲa. In interrogative sentences, the auxiliary takes the interrogative marker as in (13b). For detailed description on the
essive-translative construction see Szeverényi & Wagner-Nagy 2017a.

KVB_97_EvilSpirit.0274Pronominal ItemsNganasan has personal, interrogative, demonstrative pronouns and intensifiers. Human beings are referred by personal pronouns, while animals, plants
and objects by demonstratives. There are no dedicated possessive pronouns;
this is expressed using personal pronouns (see Section 4.1.7). Indefinites are
derived from question words using the -küə/-güə, -čə clitic-like morphemes (see
Section 7.3 and Chapter 16). There are no special negative pronouns, the question words with the emphatic clitic -kəlʲičə/ -gəlʲičə may be treated as negative
polarity items (see Section 4.6 below). Neither relative, nor reflexive pronouns
are present. The reflexive or reciprocal meaning is covered by the word hütəðə
‘body’, by the word ńa ‘companion, friend’ with the possessive suffix, and by
the word sɨɁ ‘image of living things’ marked for the relevant personal possessive suffix (15). If in this kind of sentences the intensifier ŋonə- appears, it has
an emphatic intensified meaning. Another possibility for expressing a reflexive
situation is the usage of reflexive conjugation; cf. Section 3.3 in Chapter 5.

Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns can only refer to humans, animals and plants, while objects
are referred to by demonstrative pronouns, but occasionally demonstratives
refer to humans as in sentence (17c). There is no gender distinction.
All three numbers (sg, du, pl) and each person has a corresponding personal pronouns, making nine personal pronouns altogether. Special honorific
forms (such as Hungarian ön, or the use of plural forms in this function, as
in German Sie (3pl) or Russian Vy (2pl)) do not exist, however there are few
examples for the use of 2pl personal pronoun in this function. This is obviously
due to Russian influence.
The behaviour of personal pronouns is the most noteworthy aspect of pronouns. Although they cannot be inflected in the way other nominal categories
can, several emphatic clitic-like suffixes can be attached (cf. Section 4.1.4).
These emphatic markers may attach to other pronouns as well.
The 3sg, 3du and 3pl forms of personal pronouns are derived from the noun
sɨʔ ‘portrayal, picture, image (of living things)’ followed by corresponding possessive suffixes. The forms are shown below:
(16) Personal pronouns
sgdupl1st person mənə ‘I’
mii ‘the two of us’
mɨŋ ‘we’
2nd person tənə ‘you’
tii ‘the two of you’
tɨŋ ‘you’
3rd person sɨtɨ ‘she, he’ sɨti ‘the two of them’ sɨtɨŋ ‘they’Personal pronouns most often function as the subject of a sentence. If the
pronoun is the subject,—Nganasan being a consistent null-subject language—
it is only optional; the verb inflection replaces the pronouns. Overt personal
pronouns are only used in contexts where they have special discourse significance, such as emphasis. Sentence (17a) is an example with an overt pronoun
in the subject position, while in sentence (17b) only the verbal ending refers
to the number and person of the subject. (More about this topic see in Chapter 9). To the 3rd person humane referent in subject position can refer to theword classes107anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’. The demonstrative always take the 2nd
person possessive suffix. Some speaker use instead the anaphoric demonstrative the distant deictic pronoun takəə ‘that’. The exact distribution between
these forms regard further investigation.

ChND, 2008Personal pronouns can also serve as direct objects, but unlike to other Samoyedic languages, they not have inflected forms. Presently, the accusative and the
genitive forms are identical to the nominative form. Older speakers still tend to
use the former suffixes, especially in the accusative case (-m), however there are
only very few examples for this phenomenon. In the speech of younger speaker
the inflected forms never appear. Sentence (18a) illustrates a personal pronoun
in object position with the accusative suffix, while sentences (18b–c) depict a
personal pronoun without the case marker.

ChNS_080214_Hibula_flkd.070Local menaings of personal pronoun are expressed by special postpositional
forms (cf. Section 4.1.1 below).
4.1.1
Oblique Cases of Personal Pronouns
Local meaning of personal pronouns are replaced by postpositional structures.
This feature is not unique among Uralic languages; for example Nenets, Enets
and Hungarian oblique forms are also of postpositional origin.
In oblique cases of personal pronouns, the inflected postposition na ‘to;
near’ is used, which is marked for case and takes a possessive suffix from the
oblique series. This postposition is optionally accompanied by the personal
pronoun. Postpositions do not take the common case suffixes described in Section 3, in Chapter 4, but rather a more ancient set of suffixes. Elative forms are
an exception, since they are inflected with the suffix which is still being used
today. The postpositional/adverb series of case suffixes is discussed below, in109word classesSection 5. In contrast to the locative, elative and prolative, the lative is morphologically unmarked. The reason for this is that the ancient lative suffix gets
deleted, according to morphophonological rules, before possessive suffixes that
begin with a consonant. (For a discussion of phonological rules, see Section 7
in Chapter 2.) The personal pronouns can appear before postpositional forms,
but this is only optional. The following chart shows the oblique forms.

Postpositional Form of Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns do not have forms marked for postpositions. Instead, such
forms are used where the postposition itself takes the appropriate possessive
suffix (the one attaching to oblique cases). These inflected postpositions can
be used on their own, fulfilling the function of a personal pronoun, but the
relevant personal pronoun can appear before them. The chart below shows
how these forms are derived with the stem ŋilʲənu ‘under’. Other postpositions
behave in a similar manner. For information about postpositions, see Section
10 below.

Comparative Forms of Personal Pronouns
If in an equality sentence the compared entity is referred to by a pronoun, it is
expressed by a derived form of the postposition na ‘to, towards’ or with mantə
‘like, similar’. If the construction is formed with the postposition na, the similativesuffix (-RəKU) is followed by the nominative form of the possessive suffix
that refers to the appropriate person. It is, however, the oblique forms of possessive personal suffixes that connect to the postposition mantə. Both forms
are listed in Table 3.1.
In an equative sentence, the forms with the postposition na and -RəKU can
appear without the personal pronoun, while the postposition mantǝ is always
preceded by the pronoun.

TKF_031118_Ostyak_flk.507If in a comparative construction, the standard of comparasion is pronominal,
the ancient elative form of the postposition na followed by the possessive suffix
form of the oblique series surfaces. In such constructions the object of comparasion must precede the predicate. The standard of the comparasion may
be covert and indicated only verbal ending attached to the predicate (verb or
adjective), as in (30a). The common elative forms are addressed in chart (20)114chapter 3table 3.2Pronouns formed from the special stem1 person (1sg, 1du, 1pl)

Special Forms of Personal Pronouns
There are special forms for emphatic personal pronouns. Emphatic clitics can
connect only to these, just like some derivational suffixes. The special stems of
pronouns never appear on their own, only in suffixed form. The stem is followed
by an emphatic suffix (cf. Section 7, in Chapter 16) and the oblique case form of
the possessive suffix. The special stem ends in a -ń consonant, which although
it does not appear overtly, initiates palatalization and nasalization (cf. Section
7.4 in Chapter 2). In third person forms, the special stem has two versions. In
the sections below, which stem is used for the given pronoun form is always
indicated. Table 3.2 shows the special stems and the structure of the personal
pronouns.
Below is an overview of the forms of personal pronouns derived with the
limitative suffix as well as with the various emphatic suffixes.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"

Anaphora
Pronouns in subject position are not common. As mentioned above, subject
are often referred to only by a verbal ending, but the proximal demonstrative
əmtɨ ‘this’ and the anaphoric demonstrative təti ‘this, that’ can stay in the subject position. Another demonstrative with the meaning ‘this’ (əmə) cannot be
used as a reference marker. It can only remain as a modifier in an NP.
The demonstrative əmtɨ ‘this’ often appears after the overt NP in nonprimary role in the clause. Furthermore, it can be used as a reference marker,
if the primary participant in one of the previous clause surfaces appears as in
(10). In this case, the NP referred to is introduced in the sentences before.

with the 2sg referential possessive suffix (tətirə and əmtɨrə) can occur in the
sentence in the topic position. The proximal demonstrative əmtɨrə is used as a
referent to a previous discourse element for example in equative constructions
(11a), but it often appears in the sentence as a lexicalized discourse particle
(11b).

JSM_090809_Life_nar.133The object position is not obligatory filled, if the object is dropped, this is compensated by the use of the objective conjugation as sentence (16a) shows. In

both the subject and the object are dropped. The verbal ending indicates both
the subject and the object.

ChNS_080302_Wife_nar.011It has been seen in Section 3.3 in Chapter 5 that it is possible to refer to an object
with the reflexive conjugation. Nganasan does not use reflexive pronouns, but
in sentence (18a) below, the reflexive suffix is bound by the phonetically not
realized pronoun sɨtɨ, which is marked with (pro) in the sentence. If there arediscourse organization463object pronouns in the sentence, the referent of the overt object and subject
pronouns cannot be the same (18b). In this case, the reflexive conjugation is
not used.

Possessive Markers in Referential Function
It is a well-known phenomenon that the Samoyedic languages use possessive
suffixes in non-possessive functions (cf. Nikolaeva 2003, Siegl 2015, Zayzon 2015
etc.). Some of the possessive suffix have a referentiality function. This use is
similar to the definite article, however it cannot be stated that the possessive suffixes are grammaticalized articles. The reason is that definiteness in
Samoyedic languages can be expressed with other means as well.
The 2sg and 3sg possessive suffixes are often used in a referential function.
There are two central heroes in example (19), the mouse and the reindeer. In
sentence (19a) the mouse is not marked, but it is definite. In sentence (19c) the
main participant is the reindeer, which was introduced by sentence (19b), this
sentence is a semantic correction to (19a). Thus, the 3sg possessive suffix on
the word ‘reindeer’ in sentence (19c) is used as a linking element (anaphoric) to
the referent, which was mentioned in the previous sentence. The same referent
appears in sentence (19d), but in this sentence, it is marked by the 2sg suffix.
The switch from 3sg to 2sg is a common strategy in folklore text to mark topic
continuity, but it appears in narrative texts as well. In sentence (19g) the mouse
is also marked by 2sgposs. This participant was not mentioned lexically in the
previous sentences, but from the situation the hearer can identify it, because it
was introduced by sentence (19a).

TKF_990816_Lemming_flkd.066The referential use of the 2sg possessive suffix is possible, if the marked NP
functions as subject of the sentence (19d), however it never occurs in another
argument position. The marker may combine with proper nouns and can also
be found on a determined noun phrase with a demonstrative təti ‘that, this’. It
must be stated that there are no examples with the other demonstrative (əmtɨ
‘this’) in this context.

PED_061023_MyAunt_nar.069As Zayzon pointed out (2015: 270), in the object position the 3sg marker is used
more often than the 2sg possessive marker. If in the sentence, both arguments,
the subject and the object are topicalized, the subject topic takes the 2sg suffix
and the object the 3sg as in (19g) above and in (21) below. However, it must be
mentioned that in most cases the 3sg often express true possessivity as well.

MVL_080225_Djajku_flkd.041The 3sg possessive marker can be used, if the referent is not mentioned in
the previous sentences, but the speaker can reconstruct it from the discourse
(associative anaphoric use). In sentence (22b) the door is marked by the pos-466chapter 14sessive suffix, but it was not mentioned earlier. However, the anchor for it can
be reconstructed.

MVL_080303_SevenGirls_flkd.009As mentioned above, the 3sg is used, if the referent is mentioned in a previous
sentence (see sentences (19b–c) above). If the referent is not in the previous
clause, but it was introduced earlier, the 3sg can also be used (23b).

PKK_71_Djajku_flkd.147The first person possessive marker also appears in an associative anaphoric
function. In the following sentences, the 1sg marker is used. First the trap is
marked with it. The trap was introduced, but this sentence states that the trap
belongs to the ogre. Thus, it marks a true possessive relation. In sentence (24b)
it marks the fox. It would be possible to introduce the fox without any possessive marker. In this case, the fox can be any fox. In this text, the narrator first
introduced one of the main characters of the text. After introducing the ogre,
the second protagonist, the polar fox is introduced and it is marked by the 1sg.
They two are the central heroes of the texts.

ChND_061023_School_nar.0123Direct and Indirect SpeechThis section examines the describing of direct and quoted speech. Normally,
there are three participants in a speech event, the original speaker, the reporter,
and the listener. It is characteristic for folklore as well as for narrative texts that
the speakers extensively use quoted speech. However, Nganasan does not have
any quotative marker (complementizer or quotative particle), thus all quoted
speech is canonical direct speech and represents the words of the original
speaker. Quoted speech is typically introduced by an utterance predicate with
the meaning ‘say’, ‘tell’ or ‘think’. The following chart displays the speech act
verbs.","[478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486]"

4chapter 10Comparative ConstructionsThis section discusses the main types of comparative constructions. Comparative clauses belong to the from group of Locational Comparatives (cf. Stassen
2011). The comparative construction in most cases contains two noun phrases:
the object of comparison (the comparee NP) and the standard NP. Quality
(qual) is normally expressed through an adjective. Three degrees of adjectives
are recognized: equality, comparative and superlative.
4.1
Equality
The adjectives that express quality appear without a marker. The standard NP
is optional in this construction. If the standard NP is present, it is followed
by a comparative postposition mantə, as in example (59) below. Example (60)
shows that the standard NP can take a similative suffix (-rəKU), which is an
alternative to a postpositional phrase.

KSM, 20064.2
Comparative
As in many other Uralic languages, in a comparative sentence, the standard NP
takes the elative suffix -KəCtə (-kətə, -gətə), because there are no comparative
particles. The adjective takes the predicate position and it must be inflected
predicatively. The word order in a comparative construction is mostly as follows: comparee np—standard np in elative case—quality with verbal
ending, but the comparee can follow the standard as in (61b).","[408, 409]"
"396chapter 111.1
Lative/Dative Coding
The basic type of the ditransitive construction is the dative construction. As
the following sentences show, if the recipient is lexically expressed in the
sentence, the theme is marked with the accusative, while the recipient, with
the lative/dative case (-ntǝ). The most usual order of constituents is A(gent)
Th(eme) R(ecipient) V(erb), but as sentences (1b–c) show, the recipient or the
theme can appear postverbally. The preverbal participant is always topicalized.
The agent is only seldom overt. Typologically, the most prototypical ditransitive
verb is misʲi ‘give’, for this reason examples with this verb are provided here.
As sentence (2) shows there are no differences between the recipient marking
with other verbs.

Postpositional Coding
There are two postpositions used in the construction: the allative postposition
ďa and the postposition na ‘to, near’. Their usage depends on the type of verb.
If the verb denotes mental transfer, i.e. it is a verb of speech (‘tell’, ‘say’ etc.)
or a verb of explication (‘show’ etc.), the recipient-like participant (addressee)
cannot be encoded with the lative/dative case, it must be expressed by a postpositional phrase with the allative postposition ďa. If the participant is a true
recipient, the verb expresses physical transfer and the postposition ďa cannot
be used. In this case, the inflected postposition na ‘to, near’ is used, marked for
case with an ancient case marker (cf. Section 4.1.2 in Chapter 3), and takes a
possessive suffix from the oblique series.
1.2.1
Mental Transfer
Three verbs of speech are used most often: munuďa ‘say’, ďebtuďa ‘tell’ and
kumunsa ‘what say/tell’. The theme is always marked with the accusative. It
remains in the nominative, if the verb takes the imperative 2sg ending, as in
sentence (3b). Pronominal agent can be expressed lexically, if it is emphasized
as in (3c), but it is most often realized as null-subject (cf. (3a)). The following
sentences show the most typical construction with mental transfer verbs.","[414, 415, 416]"

TKF_041210_NenetsManAndGiant_flkd.031In such structures, the adjective must refer to an inalienable property of the
body part (dimensional adjective, colour term, physical property). There are
some lexicalized phrases, such as the words given below.

In some cases, the name of the body part also carries a possessive suffix, whose
function is not really clear. It probably has an identification function. Furthermore, between the noun and the adjective an adverb can appear.

JDH_060901_DolganChief_flkd.0272Determined Noun PhraseIn Nganasan, definiteness is expressed in several ways, for example by a possessive suffix (cf. Chapter 4, Section 4), word order on the sentence level (cf.
Section 1, in Chapter 14) or determiners such as tǝti ‘this/that/it’, takǝǝ ‘that over
there’, ǝmǝ ‘this here’ or ǝmtɨ ‘this’. The class of determiners is a small closed
class. They express deixis or definiteness. For the list of determiners see Chapter 4, Section 4.2.2.
Determiners always precede the head and can never follow it. In the adnominal function, demonstrative determiners have to co-occur with nouns and
noun phrases, as in sentences (12a–b–c–d) below. As pre-modifiers, a demon-312chapter 8strative only partially agrees with the head. The agreement rules are the same
as those which effect adjectives. (See in Section 1 above.)

this case, the determiner is not a modifier, rather a free-standing pronoun. In

Postpositions with Limited Case Inflection or without Inflection
This group of postpositions is small. The postpositions belonging to this group
have a reduced case inventory or they are non-inflectable.
1. nanu ‘with’: The postposition nanu is formed from the na- postpositional
stem by the ancient locative suffix (-nU). Its meaning is similar to that of the
comitative case, which is in the process of grammaticalization, but in contemporary language is still not a fully grammaticalized case suffix. The following
sentences show the usage of the comitative postposition. For examples with
the comitative suffix -na see Section 3 in Chapter 4, for the comitative construction see Section 6 in Chapter 8.

Numerals
Definite numerals are cardinal and ordinal numerals. Cardinal numerals indicate how many entities the NP denotes; ordinal numerals identify the entity
in its order (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd … etc.). Syntactically both behave as an adjective (cf. Section 3.1 in Chapter 8), thus the inflectional properties of numerals
are identical to those of the adjectives. Cardinal numerals are either simple or
compounded, while ordinal numerals are derived. Generally, nouns following
a numeral are in the singular. Rarely plural or dual forms also appear.

7.1.1
Cardinal Numerals
At present, Nganasan uses a base ten system, although the complex structure of the numerals sʲitiðətə ‘eight’ and ŋami͡ajčümə ‘nine’ indicates that its
numeral system was not base ten at some point in the past. The first part of
sʲitiðətə ‘eight’ is sʲiti ‘two’, whereas its second part is related etymologically to
the numeral četə ‘four’ (cf. Janhunen 1977: 71). The first part of the numeral159word classessəŋhəlʲaŋkə ‘five’ etymologically has a Proto-Samoyedic reflex (*səmpə-, Janhunen 1977: 133), whereas its second part is -lʲaŋkə, a derivational suffix which is
no longer productive. The short form of the numeral (səmbə), however, is used
in deriving ordinal numerals (cf. Section 7.1.2).2 The first part of ŋami͡ajčümə
‘nine’ is ŋami͡aj ‘other’. In this case, the second part is unclear: either a derivative
or a composite. The fact that a similar, although etymologically not completely
identical system is found in the other Samoyedic languages, suggests that a
change occurred already in the numeral system of the language in the ProtoSamoyedic period.
Cardinal numerals are used for the attributive quantification of nouns. The
chart below shows the Nominative and the Accusative/Genitive form of numerals. The Accusative/Genitive is often irregular, as consonant gradation does
not apply, for example compare the two forms for sʲiti ‘two’ or četə ‘four’. The
numeral ‘zero’ is not attested.

compounded: 20 is 2 + 10 etc., though 50 and 500 are exceptions, where the2 Earlier Enets data included a longer, that is, derived form (cf. Castrén 1854, 1855), whereas
modern fieldwork data quote a shorter form (cf. Siegl 213b: 181). In Nenets and Selkup only
derived forms have been attested. For more on the other functions of the derivational suffix
as well as for a detailed etymological account, see Szeverényi 2003.","[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"

Conditional Clause
Conditional sentences express hypothetical situations or implications. According to the degree of conditionality, there are two basic types of conditional
sentences. In the first type, both the main clause (matrix clause) and the subclause express conditionality (double conditional: hypothetical or counterfactual conditional). In the second sentence type, only the sub-clause is conditional (simple conditional), the main clause does not express conditionality.
Conditional meaning can be expressed by a converb (nominalized verbal form:
-HÜɁ or -HÜɁnÜ) or through the irrealis mood (see Section 5.8 in Chapter 5).
In what follows, an overview of the simple conditional sentences is given with
a description of complex structure thereafter.
3.6.1
Simple Conditional
In this sentence type, only one of the clauses expresses conditionality, the other
clause is either a statement or the verb of the matrix clause is marked for mood,
but not for conditional. Temporal information is always encoded by a finite verb
form in the sub-clause. The order of the two clauses is not determined.
The core of this clause is the conditional converb form -hüɁ in the adverbial
clause, which can be followed by a possessive suffix referring to the agent of the
structure (37a–b). The agent can also be marked by a nominal category in the
genitive (37c). If the agent is expressed by an NP the converb form never takes
the possessive suffix. If the nominalized form (converb form) neither takes the
possessive suffix nor is preceded by an NP in genitive, the statement is general,
as in (37d).

ChND_041213_Reminiscence_nar.037This construction has not only a conditional meaning, but often allows for a
temporal interpretation as well (38). In this case, the verb of the main clause
typically takes the future marker.

MVL_080229_TwoEyes_flkd.114In the conditional clause, the future tense is expressed by the future form of
the conditional converb (-hüɁnü), which can be followed by a possessive suffix. The verb in the main clause can appear in the aorist form (39a), as well as in
the future (39b). The aorist indicates immediate future, while the future form
refers to distant future. This kind of construction can express consequence as
well (39b).

KNT_960809_WildAnimals_flkd.184The conditional marker bɨələ ‘if’ can appear in the subordinated clause as well.
It takes the clause-initial position, before the subject and the nominalized conditional form. Usually, it occurs with the future conditional form.

KES_080721_Disease_flkd.138Occasionally, the Russian conjunction jeslʲi ‘if’ is also used, however it is very
rare. Only the conjunction is borrowed, the structure is not, thus the conditional converb form must appear in the subordinated clause. A clause with a
finite verb is not found. Sentence (41a) shows a conditional in aorist, while sentence (41b) illustrates the future structure.

Double Conditional
In double conditional sentences, the conditional sub-clause precedes the main
clause with the conclusion. In most cases, there is no conjunction in the subclause. The verb in the main clause is in the irrealis mood (cf. Section 5.8 in
Chapter 5), if the sentence refers to the past, otherwise it takes the general
inflections for aorist or future. A converb form is used in the sub-clause. The
temporal reference of the two clauses need not be the same.
In the sentences below the sub-clause is in the past, while the main clause is
in the present. The main verb of the main clause is in the irrealis form, while the
main verb of the sub-clause is in the past, accompanied by the converb of the
copula. In sentences (43a) and (43b) both clauses refer to the past. In sentence
(43a) the clauses express simultaneity. In the main clause, the verb is inflected
for irrealis, while in the sub-clause the verb takes the past tense marker and it
is accompanied by the conditional form of the BE-verb. In sentence (43b) the
time reference is not the same, because there is an anterior relation. The verb
in the main clause is also inflected for irrealis. As the irrealis cannot be used in
the past, only the subordinate clause marks the temporal reference of the main
clause: the past participle of the verb is followed by the past tense form of the
existential verb and the converb of the existential verb. Although both clauses
refer to the past, the circumstances caused the consequence, i.e. this is a case
of antecedence.","[466, 467, 468, 469, 470]"

Passive Construction with Overt Agent
The overt agent is typically an animate initiator of an action, but the agent can
be also inanimate. In this case, the agent is a dynamic force of nature (26). The
animate agent is causing the action or it is responsible for something happening.

ChND_061023_School_nar.041If the agent is overt, it is mostly a bare noun or an NP, but demonstrative pronouns referring to persons can be used as well. It is marked by the lative suffix.
If it takes the topic position, it must be shifted to the beginning of the sentence,
as in sentence (28b). As the sentences illustrate, the agent was mentioned in the
previous sentence (husband of the director), and the agent is the given active
information, while the new information is that he (thus the director’s man)
set the school on fire. The interaction between the information status and passivization is illustrated by the following sentence pair.

ChND_061023_School_nar.055In a passive sentence the grammatical subject has the thematic role patient,
and normally is placed at the beginning of the sentence or clause, thus it
takes the topic position (29a). However, if the patient is pronominal, it can be
dropped as in sentences (29b–c). In this case, the verbal ending refers to the
patient. Sentences having both arguments, e.g. the agent and the patient (the
subject and the object of the active construction) are extremely rare. In this
case, the verbs always take the reflexive conjugation in the corpus.

Chapter 16) can also be passivized with the passive suffix, which follows theverbal valence and valence-changing operations301other derivational suffixes. In most cases, the agent does not appear in such
sentences, but if the agent is topicalized, it is overt in the construction as in
sentence (28b) above. The following sentence shows an agentless causativepassive construction with a covert patient.

Agentless Passive
As mentioned above, the constituent carrying the agent role is most often omitted. If the agent is lexically covert, it can be general, indefinite or it is mentioned
above in the text or in the preceded clause. This latter case is shown by sentence
(31) below.

KES_080721_Lemming_flkd.031If the passive sentence contains a general statement or it is indefinite, the
agent is covert, as in sentences (32a–b). In both cases the verb agrees with the
grammatical subject (semantic patient) and carries the personal endings of the

Passive Construction with Non-patient Grammatical Subjects
Ditransitive and other three-part predicate constructions can also be transformed into passive sentences. If in a passivized construction the recipient,
the recipient-like, or other argument is topicalized, it takes the position of the
grammatical subject. In sentence (33a) the recipient-like argument is topical,
thus it is placed at the beginning of the sentence. But this argument can also
be dropped, because the verbal ending can refer to it, as in (33b). The theme is
not overt in the sentence. This type of construction often appears with the verb
munuďa ‘say’. The passive recipient construction always appears with pronominal or covert recipient, there are no examples for a lexical (NP) expressed
recipient (or recipient-like argument) in the corpus.

Reciprocal Constructions
In reciprocal constructions, both participants play the semantic role of agent
and patient at the same time. On the one hand, there are special reciprocal
verbs, like ďoðaküürsʲa ‘greet each other’ on the other hand the verb can take
the reciprocal suffix -U as in sentences (35a–b) below.

PKM_930616_Njisyme.283In other cases, a lexically expressed element is needed to express a reciprocal
relation. In prototypical and natural reciprocal structures one of the following
expressions appears: a) ńa ‘fellow’ + possessive suffix +allative postposition ďa
‘to each other’, b) ńa ‘fellow’ + possessive suffix ‘each other’. Verbs in such sentences often take reflexive suffixes, but it is not obligatory. This construction is
often used with verbs such as tell, converse, hold etc. The following sentences
show the usage.

Reflexive Constructions
In a prototypical reflexive situation, the agent and the patient are the same
entity. Therefore, if a verb is made reflexive, the number of its arguments
decreases. Nganasan does not apply analytic reflexive constructs (e.g. the use
of reflexive pronouns), reflexivity is expressed by a separate conjugation (cf.
Section 3.3 in Chapter 5). If a transitive verb takes the endings of the reflexive
conjugation, the meaning is reflexive. In the case of intransitive verbs, however,
reflexive-medial endings do not convey a reflexive meaning. This often happens
with verbs of motion (cf. Section 1.3 in Chapter 9). The sentence below shows
how a reflexive inflectional suffix changes the meaning of the sentence. The
first part of the sentence is not reflexive, the verb can take inflectional suffixes
from the subjective (or the objective) paradigm. The second part of the sentence describes a reflexive situation; the verb must have a reflexive ending. No
other element is inserted into the sentence.

Transitivization and Detransivitization
In this section, I discuss operations that bring changes in verb transitivity; there
are two types of these operations: transitivization and detranzitivization.
2.4.1
Transitive and Causative
A transitive verb can be formed from an intransitive verb with a transitivecausative suffix. In this case, the productive suffix -BTU (-btɨ, -btu) (cf. Section 6.3.2.2, in Chapter 16) is to be used. Another, less frequently occurring
transitive-causative forming non-productive suffix is -RU (-ru, -rɨ) (cf. section 6.3.2.3, in Chapter 16) on intransitive verbs such as hinsʲi ‘cook’ (intr.) →
hiriďi ‘cook something’. The following sentence pair shows how the argument
structure of the verb is extended by the derivation. Sentence (38a) has a oneargument intransitive verb, thus it takes only the subject in nominative as its
argument. Note, however that the pronominal subject can be covered in this
case as well. The other participant (ďesɨgǝtǝ ‘from the father’) is optional, thus
this is only an adjunct. The derived verb in sentence (38b) has at least two arguments: the subject (overt or covert) and the direct object.","[317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323]"

ChND-080719_Life.031The general order of the modifier and head construction is changed if the head
noun is the name of a body part. These structures can be regarded as proprietive
structures (‘X with N’, ‘X having N’). This case may be called a double attributive
construction. The first element of this construction functions as an attributive
of the second noun. The construction is as follows: [[N ADJ] N]. There is an
inalienable possessive relation between the head and the modifier, which is the
head that has been modified by an adjective. These structures always describe
constant states, while the general, adjective–noun order can express inherent
and temporary properties:

KNT, 19962Valence-Changing OperationsThere are two sentence types according to the morphological make-up of the
agent, patient and (verbal) predicate: active and passive. Causative and reciprocal sentences, which again arise due to the suffixation of the verb, belong to
active sentences. If the verb takes a passive (-RU), causative (-RUBTU, -BTU) or
reciprocal suffix, the valence and the argument structure of the verb changes.
First, passivization is described, then reciprocal und reflexive constructions,
and finally, an overview of transitivization is presented.
2.1
Passivization
The passive is an inadequately studied grammatical aspect of this language.
There are only very few descriptions on passive construction. Nagy (1999) and
Helimski (1998) deal with morphological features, while Leisiö (2006) gives an
overview of passive constructions.
Passive structures can be formed from both transitive and intransitive verbs.
In the passivized sentences built from transitive verbs, the grammatical subject
plays the patient role of the action. This is illustrated by the following sentence
pair. The first sentence (19a) is active, the second sentence (19b) is passive. Theverbal valence and valence-changing operations295agent can appear only as an adjunct in the sentence, and if it is overt, it takes
the lative case marker (more detailed see in Section 2.1.2 below).

ChND, 2008The sentence pair shows that by passive transformation, the performer of the
action (my brother) is sent to the background, while the object (letter) is shifted
to the position of syntactic subject, which is also the position of topic. As
described below, the agent is only facultative; in a good portion of sentences, it
is dropped.
2.1.1
Strategies of Passivization
There are two ways of expressing passive morphologically: with a passive derivational suffix -RU (-ru, -rɨ, -rü, -ri, -ra, -lu, -lɨ, -lʲü, -lʲi) or with a passive participle
(-mǝǝ). Both strategies are common. The following section gives an overview on
morphological features of the passive, after which the passive structures are
described.
2.1.1.1
Passive Sentences with Passivized Verb
The passive suffix can attach to perfective and imperfective transitive verbs as
well as to perfective and imperfective intransitive verbs. If the verb takes the
passive derivational suffix -RU, it can only take the suffixes of the subjective
(20d) or reflexive conjugation (20a–b–c). The usage with reflexive conjugation
is the most common one. Passivization of transitive verbs forms a personal passive; while passivization of intransitive verbs produces impersonal constructions (see in Section 2.1.2.3 below). Passive verbs can take mood markers and
further derivational suffixes (cf. sentences (21) and (22) below); they have a
gerundial as well as a connegative form. The following sentences illustrate the
inflectional structure of a passive verb.","[311, 312, 313, 314]"
"492chapter 15The characteristic smell or taste of something can be expressed by an adjective derived from the noun with the help of the -ǝgə derivational suffix (cf.
Section 6.2.1 in Chapter 16), as in examples in chart (31). The word ŋəbtə ‘smell’
can also take this derivational suffix: ŋəbtəəgə ‘smell of a(n old) man’.

According to our fieldwork data, a difference in the use of adjectives exists,
according to the [±human] value of the referent. Thus, two different adjectives
are to be used. It must be noted that some native speakers claim that the word
hoďəə can refer to a person as well, but others think it cannot. Similarly, some
say that sočakaʔa can also refer to a tree, but others think it cannot.
2.6
Temperature Adjectives
Nganasan adjectives expressing temperature are twofold. In one instance, the
true adjective is used, and in another, the verb’s participial form can be used as
an adjective. The list in (36) illustrates the adjectives, whereas the one in (37)
shows the participial forms. For a detailed semantic description of the temperature adjectives, see Brykina & Gusev (2015), for temperature nouns, see Section
1.7 above.

Birth, Death
For describing birth and death, a number of lexemes are available which are
not completely synonymous. In one situation, one lexeme, a basic word, is used,
while in another, an inflected form is needed. The difference in use is based on
the feature [±human].
(38) Lexemes for birth and death
‘die’:
kuəďа
kotǝrusa [passive form from kotǝďa ‘hunt’] [object has the
feature -human]
koturusa [passive form from kotuďa ‘kill’]
ďaŋgumsa [lit. ‘become a gap’; cf. ďaŋgujsʲa negative existential verb]
‘be born’:
ŋətumsɨ [lit. ‘become visible’; cf. ŋəðusɨ ‘be visible’]
‘give birth’: ďiəďi [-human]. This lexeme is not found in the corpus. It
is taken from the dictionary (Kosterkina et al. 2001)
küŋalʲə- [+human]. This lexeme is recorded only twice
from the same speaker. In both cases the object is also
present in the sentence (cf. sentence 39b below).
karəďa [+human]. This lexeme is not found in the corpus.
It is taken from the dictionary (Kosterkina et al. 2001)
ńuə( j)čəsɨ [+human] (cf. ńuə ‘child’). This lexeme is a
derivation from the word ńuə ‘child’ (cf. sentence 39a
below).
Sentences (39a–b) show the use of the lexemes meaning ‘give birth’.

Motion Verbs
The system of verbs describing movement is quite sophisticated. On the one
hand, verbs are differentiated according to the kind of movement, whether it
takes place on the mainland or on the water. On the other hand, the referent
plays a crucial role. Depending on its value [±human] and the fashion of moving, the correct verb is chosen. The verbs below are grouped according to their
value [±water] and [±human].
3.2.1
Movement on the Mainland
Some verbs denoting movement on the mainland can partly be used with
human subjects only, while others, with entities of any kind. Chart (40) displays the verbs sorted by the above-mentioned distribution.

3.2.2
Movement on the Water
Words expressing movement on the water (aquamotion) have been semantically analyzed by Gusev (2007b). For a more detailed description, see this work.
Again, it can be argued that the differentiation in [±human] plays a significant
role in the choice of the verb. Additionally, the value [±animal] is an issue here.
As was demonstrated by Gusev (2007b: 439), the act of swimming is not of any
importance to the Nganasan. This is partly due to the weather conditions and
to the fact that most do not know how to swim. The number of verbs used with
a [+human] entity is thus very limited. For the other two values, a semantic differentiation can be detected. The verb sɨǝďa ‘sink’ is not restricted to any kind
of subject, it can be used for all entities. The chart (42) illustrates the variation
in the use of the verb meaning ‘to swim’ according to the three different features.
(42) Verbs with meaning ‘swim’

ŋǝntǝusa ‘swim in the boat’ďambisʲa ‘float, drift’kuďüsa ‘float’3.3
Cooking, Feeding and Eating Terminology
As was indicated in Section 1.6 above, cooking plays a fairly insignificant role
in the Nganasan way of life. The number of cooking verbs is therefore rather
limited. The associated verbs are listed in (43).
(43) Cooking verbs
hiriďi
‘cook, boil’ [tr.]
hinsʲi
‘cook, boil’ [intr.]
hu͡atiďa ‘boil, cook’ [tr.]
hiðibtisʲi ‘bake’
munsəďa ‘boil’ [intr.]
The verbs hiriďi and hinsʲi are derivates with a bound stem hi- which cannot
occur as a separate word. The transitive verb has a non-productive transitive
suffix -Ru while intransitive verbs have a non-productive stative suffix -n. (For497lexiconmore detail on these suffixes see Section 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2 in Chapter 16.) The
two transitive verbs with the meaning ‘cook, boil’ seem to be synonymous.
Compare sentences (44b) and (44c). Both verbs can be used with the destinative. With the word ŋəmsu ‘meat, food’ both verbs can be used, but with
transferred meaning such as ‘cook the ogre’ or ‘cook the child’ only the verb
hu͡atiďa ‘boil, cook’ appears (44d).

ChND_061101_TwoTents_flkd.017Nganasan has different forms for the concepts of ‘eating’ (solid food) and ‘drinking’ (liquid). In the differentiation between the verbs the substance of the498chapter 15patient plays the decisive role. All verbs are transitive, but the patient must be
not obligatory overt. One of the verbs has special meaning, ‘eat uncooked/raw’.
The object is normally not overt, but is mentioned in the previous sentences.
It refers to fish or meat (46a). There are some derived verbs expressing ‘eating’
and ‘drinking’ which are built with the help of the denominal derivations suffix -ir attached to names of foods and drinks. (For this suffix see Section 6.3.1 in
Chapter 16). Chart (45) shows these verbs, while sentences (46a–c) give some
examples for their usage.

The verb ŋəmsaɁsa only occurs twice in the corpus, in both cases it is accompanied by an overt object in the sentence. The frequentative form (bɨðɨrsɨ) of the
verb bɨtɨďi ‘drink’ lost the general meaning ‘drink’, and now it is used with the
meaning ‘consume alcohol’. The imperfective pair of the verb ‘drink’ is formed
with the help of the iterative suffix (46d).

Temperature Verbs
There are several stative verbs denoting temperature. Stative verbs are nonderived in that many of them are marked by the translative suffix -m and have
an essive meaning. These verbs are, without exception, adjective stems, but not
all of them bear translative suffixes. The stative temperature verbs are shown
in (47), while chart (48) presents the derivates.
(47) hekusɨ

temperature nouns are described in Section 1.7.","[510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519]"
"91phonetics and phonologyAs has been depicted above in Section 7.6.1., suffixes that begin with a trill liquid delete the stem-final -Ɂ and -ŋ. The forms wherein the empty slot is created
because of deletion deserve special attention (see Section 4.3.1). In this case,
the rules are ordered in respect to one another, with consonant alternation
operating first, followed by consonant deletion. In (52) deletion counterbleeds
alternation:
(52) Rules ordered: alternation followed by deletion

alternation r → l / C__
maɁlə

baləReversing the order of alternation and deletion, as in (52) we get ungrammatical forms, since consonant deletion eliminates the potential input to consonant
alternation.
(53) Rules ordered: deletion followed by alternation

C → ∅ / __ C marə
alternation r → l / C__
_____barə
____If the stem ends in a historically empty slot which alternates with -n, (see Section 4.3.1 above) the -r- appears and does not allow alternation: hoðəbsaN ‘pencil’ (cf. hoðəbsan-ə gen): hoðəbsa-rə ‘your pencil’; mətubsaN ‘cutter’ (cf. mətubsan-ə gen): mətubsa-rə ‘your cutter’. The above stems have an empty nasal
stem-finally which is not present overtly in the nominative form. In the genitive however, it surfaces. As can be seen, the empty nasal does not obligatorily
trigger the r → l change. However, it can optionally trigger the alternation. Thus,
native speakers accept both forms, cf. ŋanaɁsarə ~ ŋanaɁsalə ‘your human
being, your person’. The latter form appears more often (61 %) in the corpus.
Another alternation process is the ŋ ~ n alternation across the morpheme
boundary. A stem-final -ŋ may change to -n before suffixes with initial -t, as in
ŋaŋ ‘mouth’: ŋantu ‘his mouth’, hi͡aŋ ‘palm of the hand’: hi͡anti ‘his palm of the
hand’. (For more examples, see Section 7.3.2.)92chapter 27.7.2
Vowel Alternation
There is an i~ü alternation. Some words have two variants, one with [ü] and one
with the [i] vowel. Both variants are used in the spoken language. Examples are
given in (54).
(54) ďori ~ ďorü
kari ~ karü
insʲüðəsa ~ ünsʲüðəsa
ŋuənir ~ ŋuənür
sʲirü ~ sʲürü‘weeping, crying’
‘bend, curve, crook’
‘drive on a light sleigh’
‘sending’
‘snow’7.8
Epenthesis
Some consonant-initial suffixes attach to consonant-final stems with a linking
vowel to eliminate a consonant cluster. This study analyses the linking vowels
as part of the stem (see Section 1.2 in Chapter 4, and Section 1 in Chapter 5). If
a suffix belongs to this class of suffixes, it always attaches to a consonant-final
stem with a vowel. There are no cases in which a certain suffix would attach
to certain consonant-final stems with a linking vowel and to other consonantfinal stems without one.
Certain suffixes (e.g. the accusative, genitive, nominative plural, and plural
accusative) attach to all consonant-final stems with a linking vowel -ə, irrespective of the harmonic value of the stem.

kir-ə-jOther suffixes (plural genitive, plural prolative, plural comitative) may attach to
the stem with one of four linking vowels, ü/u/i/ɨ. Depending on the harmonic
value of the stem, the linking vowel depending on palatality might be u or ü
after a [+back] stem, and i or ɨ after a [-back] stem.","[109, 110, 111]"
"502chapter 15There are rare cases, in which the borrowed elements form verbs, usually
occurring with some sort of Nganasan verbal suffix: lʲəči-ir- ‘cure’ (< Russ. ľеchiť ‘cure’). One portion of these verbs are cultural borrowings, the other are so
called core borrowings such as duma-ir- ‘think’ from the Russian word dumat’
‘think’. Nganasan has more than one word which expresses ‘think’ (cf. sɨńerɨrsɨ,
natǝmununsa). The main purpose of the derivation suffix -ir is verbalization,
this suffix is a common denominal verbalizer. Thus, the strategy of verbal borrowing is mostly indirect insertion as defined by Wohlgemuth (2009), but direct
insertion also occurs: belʲi-Ɂǝ-gǝj ‘they two painted’ (< Russ. belʲi-ť). In some
cases, verbs are borrowed in the Russian imperative form and conjugated with
Nganasan verbal endings as in vaspitaj-ďüə-m ‘I grow (it)’ (< Russ vospita-ť
‘grow’ and vospitaj imp.2sg).
4.2
Borrowings from Enets
In the second half of the 17th century, the Enets came to the Taimyr and settled
in relatively close proximity to the Nganasan. It must be pointed out that only
the Tundra Enets clans had contact with Nganasan. There was a lot of intermarriage between them, and borrowings between the two languages, in both
directions, became frequent. This layer of loan words has still been researched
very little. Research on these terms is rather difficult because it is often unclear
whether a word is an early or later borrowing.
According to Helimski (1994b: 132), there are words of Russian origin in Nganasan, which were borrowed indirectly, via Enets. They are as follows:
(55) Russ. karova ‘cow’ > Enets koraa > Ngan. kuraa
Russ. hleb ‘bread’ > Enets kirba > Ngan. kiriba
4.3
Borrowings from Tungusic
After the ancient Samoyed language split into its daughter languages, Tungusic–Nganasan language contacts remained intact. Based on this, certain words
are borrowed via some Manchu-Tungusic language. During the 17th and 18th
centuries the Nganasan and ethnic Evenki populations lived together in close
proximity. As a result, loanwords of Evenki origin appeared in Nganasan. This
specific layer of Nganasan borrowings has yet to be investigated. Up to this
point, there has only been some research (e.g. Futaky 1983, 1990) and short
chapters (Anikin & Helimski 2007: 143–147) describing these words. The examples below are based on the above-mentioned works. First, the words of Evenki
origin are presented which can be sorted into different groups. Some of them
are derived forms, in this case, only the stem was borrowed from Tungusic, and
the derivational suffix is from Nganasan.","[520, 521]"

of each argument. The required case is given in parentheses. If a postpositional
phrase must appear next to a regent, the postposition is given.
1.1
Verbs with Null Argument
Null argument verbs are weather-verbs, temperature-verbs or they describe calendar phenomena. These verbs have no arguments at all, not even a lexical
subject (like Hungarian Esik az eső. ‘It is raining (lit. the rain is raining)’) or
an expletive subject (like German Es regnet. ‘It is raining.’) can appear in the
sentence. Only some temperature-verbs, like česʲisʲi ‘be cold’, allow lexically
expressed subjects.
The null argument verbs can take only the 3sg verbal ending. However,
adjuncts can appear in the sentence. These verbs never appear in the passive,
causative, or imperative form. There are two types of weather-verbs: basic and
derived verbs. Non-derived vers are for example soruďa ‘rain’ and ďümunsa
‘snow’. Most of the derived verbs are formed with the help of the translative
derivational suffix (-m) from nominal category (cf. sentence 5a–c). The base
nouns or adjectives of the derived verbs are often calendar or meteorological
phenomena (4).

One Argument Verbs
To this group belong intransitive verbs and transitive verbs used in a passive sentence without the agent argument, in which the patient functions290chapter 7as the subject of the clause. The standard valence pattern for one argument
verbs is subject/agent, i.e. normally the only argument in the sentence is the
subject, which is in the nominative case, playing the semantic role of the
agent or experiencer. Motion verbs typically belong here, but there are examples from other semantic groups as well. It must be mentioned that naturally
motion verbs can have adjuncts as well, namely the location or goal of the
movement (cf. sentence (9a) below). The subject of a sentence with a oneargument verbs can be covert or overt. Chart (8) lists some one-argument
verbs.

Verbs with Two Arguments
Most of verbs with two arguments are transitive with the argument subject
(thematic role: agent) and the non-agent argument, which corresponds to the
semantic role, patient. Passive sentences in which the agent appears also have
two arguments. However, intransitive verbs might also have two arguments.
The first argument is the agent, while the second one is a phrase with the thematic role of a locative. The most typical groups are listed below. The list is inverbal valence and valence-changing operations291no sense comprehensive. Just like in all Nganasan sentences, the subject can be
omitted, as the personal suffix of the verb encodes the person and number of
the subject.

Covert)
The patient is the most typical argument besides the agent. Like the agent
(grammatical subject), the patient (grammatical object) can be covert as well,
however only the 3sg pronominal patient can be dropped in the sentence. In
this case, the verb must take the ending of the objective conjugation as sentence (10c) shows.

Agent (in Nominative or Covert)—Locative (in Local Case)
As mentioned above, the inchoative verbs express directions with the lative
case. The following verbs belong to this group: kuntuďa ‘fall asleep somewhere’; nənsuďi ‘stop somewhere’; ŋomtəďa ‘sit down somewhere’; sʲeŋkələsɨ
‘stay somewhere overnight’; məuðuruďa ‘suffer from something’; ŋüńüďa ‘gather somewhere’.

Verbs with Three Arguments
All verbs that take three arguments are transitive, and one of the arguments is
the patient/theme expressed by the accusative case. The second most frequent
argument is the beneficiary or recipient, mostly marked by the lative case or an
allative postposition. Another frequent argument is the instrument, encoded
by the locative case. An overt subject (agent) rarely occurs; it is only marked
by the verbal inflections. This section gives only a few examples, for a detailed
description of the ditransitive constructions, especially for argument marking,
see Chapter 11.","[305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311]"
