"23. Word Order.
The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject,
object and verb. It is, however, not a necessary order since syntactic
relations are sufficiently indicated by suffixes. Word order is only
important in distinguishing the functions of certain modifiers.
That is, the distinction between adjective and adverb depends upon
the position of the form in question. If the modifier stands betweenHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES27a noun and its formal suffix, it has adjectival function ; if it stands
directly before a verb, it has adverbial function. Examples:
gwa'n-enox-la
henox yagnano'a pretty woman
he shoots wellha',ago'n-gwa'lo'dak-la
gwa'lo'dak bandjalo'a very big man
he opens his mouth very widely24. Reduplication.
The grammatical processes described in the preceding sections
have all related to alternations of theme with affix or theme with
theme. Reduplication is the only grammatical process which varies
the internal form of the theme itself. The whole theme is rarely
repeated: generally only one element (i. e. phonologic element) is
repeated (cf. 37). The function of reduplication is to indicate
repeated action. Examples:
dobododobo-to cut
to cut repeatedlyy'odjoy'oy'o'djoto pinch
to pinch repeatedlyx'elex'ex'ele-to sharpen (e. g. a knife)
to sharpen repeatedlyA. T H E V E R B ( 2 582)25. General Remarks.
The elements making up a verb complex may be divided into
three classes according to their position in the word: theme affixes,
theme, and theme suffixes. The first and last of these classes are the
same in function; that is, they provide for the grammatical and
syntactical relations of the verb and also serve to amplify the
meaning of the theme. The theme itself contains no formal elements;
its meaning is the concrete, the basic one of the verb form. An
example will make this clear.
ge-nec-xa-ile-nec'-o-'they two cause me to throw it to
a distanceTheme: -He-, the reduced form of yale- to throw, hit with a missile.
Theme prefixes: ge- me; nec- causative; xa- with force, to a distance.
Theme suffixes: -nec', dual subject; -o, declarative mode; -', third
person, present tense.","[36, 37]"
"/'e-kla'edcin'eha-nadaThenagaingoing off(42) This sentence illustrates the usual word order in Tonkawa:
subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal
verb. This order is, of course, not a necessary one since the suffixes
of the words regulate most of the syntactic relations.

""Coyote"" and that for ""big"" (referring to several).
ha-naxok many, plus -'ida of them (cf. 86). Note, here, the separation of noun and modifier.
da-he-cogyo--no-n-lakno'o — an example of the third person

adjectivally (cf. 87).

freely, it is to be interpreted ""a short distance away"".

the order of their appearance in the verb, is given below.

These will be discussed in detail and examples of their use given in
sections 47—51.
The theme suffixes are much more numerous and express all
ideas of tense, mode, person (except for the three object pronouns
prefixed), and number. I n general, they have the following order.
Theme
Negative suffix
Future tense suffix
Second person object pronoun (singular)
Number suffixes (subject only)
Continuative suffix
Tense and mode suffixes
Subjective pronouns
There are minor exceptions to this order; these details and others
will be discussed in section 52.
I t is apparent from this classification t h a t our study of the
Tonkawa verb will fall rather neatly into two parts: the theme, and
the theme affixes. The first is to deal with the few variations
undergone by verb themes and to establish, if possible, the rules
governing its structure and manipulation. In the second part — the
study of theme affixes — the grammatical and syntactical variations of the verb form will be discussed.a . THE V E E B THEME ( 2 639)26. Types of Verb Theme.
Tonkawa verb themes may be divided, roughly, into two classes
— two element themes (i. e., themes composed of two phonetic
elements, cf. 5), and three element themes. The latter class may be
sub-divided, however, according to the character of the first position
element. That is, certain elements (na-, ne-, ya-, ha-, and he-)
appear consistently as the first elements in so many of these themes
t h a t they may be considered as prefixes. The themal types are,HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES29then: two element themes, three element themes (placing here those
three element themes not containing any of the above ""prefixes""),
na- themes, ne- themes, ya- themes, ha- themes, and he- themes.
Finally, there are a number of two and three element themes which
always appear with certain theme prefixes (nec-, hec-, ya-, and
da--). In these cases, the theme prefixes have become so much a
part of the theme that it cannot be used without them. The whole
classification may, then, be summarized in the following manner.
1. Prefix-less Themes;
a. Two element themes.
b. Three element themes.
2. Themes whose first elements appear to be old prefixes.
a. na- themes.
b. ne- themes.
c. ya- themes.
d. ha- themes.
e. he- themes.
3. Themes requiring theme prefixes to complete their meanings.
a. ya- themes.
b. nec- themes, (hec- themes are a sub-division of this group)
c. da•- themes.","[37, 38, 39]"
"The position of the second person object suffix varies in relation
to other theme suffixes. Normally, it follows the f u t u r e tense suffix
-a-do- a n d t h e order is a follows:
Theme — F u t . — 2d. pers. — Contin. — Mode —
But
when t h e negative suffix -abe- is added to t h e theme, the order
becomes:
Theme — 2d pers. — Neg. — F u t . — Contin. — Mode —
Examples:
ya'lo'n -a'doncfc
ya'lo'n -a'dewa'no'cI will kill him
I will kill youya'lo'n -ab -a'dono'c
ya'lo'na'b -a'dono'cI will not kill him
I will not kill youThe second person plural object is expressed by prefixing we- in
addition to the suffixed length.
we-yalo-na'we'c
we-i gabcrwe'c
we-yadje'we'cI kill ye

plural it is indicated b y t h e prefix we-.
yagbo'c
we-igabo'cI hit him
I hit them70HOIJER TONKAWA42. Pronoun Object Forms used as the Subject.
The pronoun object may also be interpreted as the subject of the
action and such an interpretation gives a slightly different connotation to the verb. For example, t'ca-b-o'c I hide (intr.), becomes
ge-t'cab-o' I hide him, where ge- is the subject and the form really
means "" I act as a hiding place for him, I hide him by standing before
him"". Or, hedjn-o'c I lie down, as contrasted with g-e-djn-o' I fall
down, i. e., I lie down involuntarily, stumble and fall. I n general,
then, the interpretation of the object as subject gives a sort of
passive significance to the action: the subject being acted upon by
forces beyond its control. Further examples of these alternations
follow.

meaning of the form depends upon the context in which it is used.

"CHAPTER I I : MORPHOLOGY (20—96)
20. Introductory.
The distinctive treatment accorded theme and theme affix is no
less important to the study of Tonkawa structure than it is for the
phonology. The theme, defined as the invariable portion of a word
form, carries the concrete significance of the word — the affixes
serve either to amplify (or restrict) this meaning or to relate the
word to the rest of the sentence.
The theme can, then, be studied quite apart from the affix. The
rules governing its structure and the elements composing it, if they
could be isolated, would give information as to the ""prehistory""
of Tonkawa. That is, variation in theme form is not relevant to the
grammar of the language. But, the theme, as it exists today, is a
petrified formation and it is not easy to determine whether or not
it is analyzable into smaller morphologic units. We shall see later
that some themes yield to analysis and, on this evidence, it is
possible to speculate upon its former structure.
Grammatical variations in Tonkawa words are accomplished
chiefly by affixation. The predominant grammatical process is
suffixation: the definite article, case, number, tense, mode, subordination, and aspect are all expressed by suffixes. Prefixes are
used much more sparingly — there are no more than six altogether.
They are more concrete in meaning than the suffixes, generally
adding significance to the word rather than serving to relate it to
other words in the sentence.
The degree of cohesion between theme and affix is rather slight:
there is never any difficulty in breaking up a word form. In other
words, agglutination is the predominant technique, although there
is, in the case of a few suffixes, a tendency towards a fusional
technique. Verb prefixes and the case suffixes of the noun exhibit a
surprising lack of unity with and dependence on the theme. Between
a noun and its case suffix may be inserted two, or even three,
modifiers and there are many examples of such suffixes being quite
independent of any particular theme; serving, instead, to modify
whole clauses. To sum up, the variation in combinatory technique
is from a very loose semi-independent type of affix to a combination
of theme and affix rather firmly welded with decided dependence
of affix upon theme.
To apply the classificatory notion of ""parts of speech"" to Tonkawa would be to do extreme violence to the spirit of the language.
I t is much more in accord with this feeling to divide all words into24HOIJER TONKAWAtwo very general classes: independent themes, i. e., those which
can stand alone, and themes which must be completed in meaning
by one or more affixes. These are, of course, purely formal divisions.
The essential criteria of function are the affixes which may be
attached to the theme in question and the position that theme may
occupy in the sentence. Thus, the word,
he is arrivingxa'x-ano'is composed of the theme xa~x- to arrive, plus certain verbal
affixes. But this complex may also take noun suffixes; thus,
xa'x-ano'-'a'lathe one to arrivewhere -'a'la is not an agentive or relative suffix but the regular
noun suffix for the nominative singular definite case. This variation
in function according to suffix and position is even more clearly
illustrated by the following where the same theme — t'cel up, above —
becomes either nominal, adverbial, or adjectival in function according as these criteria are varied.
t'cel-'a'y'ik ha'no'
t'cel ha'no'
na'don-t'cel-'a'y'ik
ha'no'he goes to the top
he goes upwards
he goes to the top of the mountainIn the first sentence, t'cel, used with a noun suffix is nominal in
function; in the second, standing directly before the verb, it is
adverbial; and, in the last, inserted between a noun and its suffix,
it has adjectival significance. ""Parts of speech"" in Tonkawa, then,
are, formally, simply two — independent themes and themes plus
affixes. The former includes words which may be nominal, adjectival,
pronominal, or adverbial in function; the latter, words having
verbal significance and particles.
The Tonkawa sentence is dominated by the verb complex. It
includes the subject and object pronouns and defines the tense,
mode, and aspect of the action. It is rarely, however, that any verb
is equivalent to a sentence: other words are always necessary to
complete the proposition. The verb is the most complex in structure
and is generally synthetic with a tendency towards a polysynthetic
structure. Nouns generally take only two suffixes; the case suffixes
and the definite article. Modifiers, inserted between noun and case
suffix, complicate its structure: it is hardly possible, however, to
regard combinations of noun and modifier as unified word complexes; they are better described as compounds.
GRAMMATICAL PROCESSES ( 2 1 — 2 4 )21. Affixation.
The prefixes are all mixed relational in character; that is, they
serve both to add significance to the word and to relate it to otherHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A NLANGUAGES25words in the sentence. They are all verbal prefixes — no noun
prefixes have been isolated. Three of them are pronominal objects,
ge- me, we- them, and geu- us, the last being a combination of the
first two (cf. 41). There are also two causative prefixes (cf. 50), and
a transitivizer restricted in usage to particular themes (cf. 36).
A prefix da-- is used in combination with the pronominal prefixes to
indicate the indirect object of an intransitive verb. Finally, there
is an adverbial prefix, xa-, x- to a distance, with force. Examples
follow:
yamx -o'c
ge-imax -o'
we-imax -o'c
geu-yamx -o'I paint his face
he paints my face
I paint their faces
he paints our facesnec-yamx -o'cI cause him to paint his facexacdew -o'c

xa-gan -o'cI throw it away
I throw it to a distancehedjn -o'c
xe-edjn -o'cI lie down
I fall downgec'adjo'
'ei-gec'adjo'chis (e. g. back) is broken
I break his (back)Suffixes are much more numerous. They, too, are predominantly
mixed relational in form and, generally, those with greater concrete
significance come nearer the theme than those having less concrete
meaning (i. e., the more formal suffixes). Verbal suffixes are much
more dependent upon the theme than are the noun suffixes. The
latter, in fact, appear to have a semi-independent character as
illustrated in the following examples.
yadjox'an -'a'lak
ya'djo'c
yadjox'an -gwa'lou-awaadak-'a'lak ya'djo'cI see the tipi
I see the very tall, big tipiIn the first sentence, the formal suffix - a-lalc is attached directly to
the noun yadjox'an, tipi. But, in the second the modifiers gwa-lou
big, hawai tall, and hadak very are inserted between the noun and
its formal suffix.
I n the verb, the subject pronouns, number, mode, tense, aspect,
and subordination are indicated by suffixes. The suffixes of the
noun express case and the definite article: some demonstratives,
too, may be regarded as noun suffixes (cf. 91).","[32, 33, 34, 35]"
"CHAPTER I. PHONOLOGY (2—19)
2. Introductory.
The Tonkawa word is composed of two major units or sets of
units. The first of these is the theme or invariable portion of the
word form. These rarely stand alone but are completed in meaning
by several affixes which amplify the meaning of the theme and
serve to relate it to other words in the sentence. There is never any
difficulty in distinguishing theme and affix: the technique binding
them together is prevailingly agglutinative. Thus, in the following
forms:
yamx-o'c
ge-imax-o'
yavnx-a'ha'aI paint his face
he paints my face
I shall paint his facethe theme is yamx- or -imax- and the affixes, -o'c first person
singular present tense, declarative mode; ge- first person object
pronoun; -o' third person singular present tense, declarative mode;
and -a-ha'a first person singular, intentive mode.
The theme in this particular case is disyllabic as are the vast
majority of verb and noun themes of Tonkawa. I t is evident, too,
that it changes in form according to its position in the verb: e. g.
contrast yamx- of the first example with -imax- of the second. This
alternation in phonetic form illustrates the most far-reaching
phonetic law in Tonkawa — that of vocalic elision by which every
other element in the theme (this rule does not apply to affixes) is
""reduced"", i. e., either loses its vowel altogether or has its vowel
shortened. I t follows, then, t h a t themes are built up, phonetically
at least, of smaller units which we shall call ""elements."" These
elements are, roughly speaking, of two types: simple elements,
composed of consonant plus vowel, and complex elements, composed
of consonant plus vowel plus consonant. Furthermore, these elements vary in form according to their position in the word — the
odd numbered elements having a ""full"" form and the even numbered
elements being ""reduced"" in form. The details of this phonetic law
must come later (cf. 5); the matter is mentioned here in order to
illustrate the fact t h a t the phonology of Tonkawa is best considered,
not as directly affecting the individual phoneme, but as affecting
combinations of such phonemes or elements. I n other words, the
basic word building unit (phonologically considered) is not the
individual sound but the element.
As mentioned above, this peculiar alternation of elements is true
only of the theme. Affixes do not vary their form no matter what
12HOIJER TONKA WAposition they hold in the word. Phonologically, then, there are
three types of element: simple theme elements, complex theme
elements and affixed elements — the first two sub-classes contrasting with the last in phonetic treatment. Affixes fall also into two
divisions: those identical with a single element and those composed
of two or more elements. Disyllabic affixes are not separable,
however, and must be treated as units.
Returning now to the word, we find it composed of several
element groups rather loosely bound together. The elements of any
one of these groups form a firmly knit unit — one that is rarely
(in the case of themes) or never (for affixes) separable. It appears
likely that themes represent the oldest of these structures; in fact,
as we shall see later (cf. 13) they are ""petrified"" formations. It is
not now possible to form new themes on the analogy of the old —
words in the language that can definitely be said to be new are
invariably compounds of older themes. Nor is it possible to vary
the essential structure of the theme except in a few rare cases.
We shall then, consider the phonetic laws of Tonkawa as they
apply directly to the three types of word building elements and
how, in this indirect way, they affect the individual phoneme.
3. The Vowel.
Tonkawa recognizes both short and long vowels as basic phonemes. In some cases, it can be shown that long vowels result from
certain contractions (cf. 9—13); in others, contractions cannot be
demonstrated. In the same way, the diphthongs listed below are
basic — i. e., while in many cases diphthongs can be proven to
result from contractions, other unanalyzable word forms also
contain diphthongs.

"THEMES FUNCTIONINGAS N O U N S ,ADJECTIVESANDADVERBS(83—88)
83. General Remarks.
We have seen, in the preceding sections, how the verb dominates
the Tonkawa sentence: how, by means of its theme and affixes, it
expresses and modifies the action and incorporates the subject and
object pronouns within its structure. However, few sentences are
complete without other words; words defining the subject and
object of the action, and words modifying the verb and its subject
and object. These, too may be studied in two sections: the theme and
its affixes. Themes of this sort are very similar to each other formally:
are, indeed, no different from the verb in formal structure save in
one respect — they have meaning when used apart from their
affixes, whereas the verb has full meaning only when used with its
formal affixes. Formally, then, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and
pronominal themes are similar and, in a good many cases, one themeHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES107can be used in any one of the four functions. The difference in function depends upon, first, the position of the theme in the sentence
and, secondly, upon the affixes it may take.
Themes functioning as nouns and personal pronouns take certain
definite suffixes which define their relationship to the verb. Demonstratives may also take such suffixes and are, in addition, often
found inserted between the noun and its formal suffix. Themes
functioning as adjectives are invariably placed between the theme
they modify (a noun functioning theme) and its formal suffix.
Themes functioning as adverbs take no suffixes whatever but are
placed — generally — before the verb themes they modify. In a
few cases, where no confusion will result, they follow the verb theme.
A Tonkawa sentence is, then, composed of a number of themes,
formally alike, each possessing characteristic affixes defining its
function in the sentence and its relationship to other words in the
sentence and each having a more or less fixed position in the
sentence. For example,
'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak djigeu nadj-o' The bad dog severely
bit a big manIn this sentence the themes are: 'egwan dog, hedjodjxo'k bad,
ha-'ago-n man, gwa-lou big, djigeu severely and nadje- to bite
The suffixes: -la nominative singular indefinite, -lak accusative
singular indefinite, and -o' declarative present, third person singular.
Neither hedjodjxo'k bad, nor gwa-lou big nor djigeu severely, function
exclusively as modifiers, hedjodjxo'k-la would mean ""a bad (one)""
or in the phrase hedjodjxo-k nadj-o' he bites him badly, would
function as an adverb; gwa'lou-la a big (one), or gwa-lou bandjal-o'
he opened his mouth widely; and djigeu-la the sharp (one), or
xal'o-n-djigeu-la a sharp knife.
For this reason we have found it best to consider themes functioning as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs as in the same category,
omitting only the pronouns (personal, possessive, and demonstrative) because they have certain specialized functions.","[116, 117]"
"682HOIJER TONKAWAFinally, there are two other verb suffixes not illustrated in these
schemes. They are the -n suffix forming infinitives (cf. 73), and a
suffix -an changing a verb to a noun (cf. 75).
53. The Negative Suffix.
The negative of any verb may be formed by adding the suffix
-abe- directly to the theme. When, however, the verb takes the
second person object, this suffix is inserted between the theme and
the negative suffix (cf. 41). The order is, then, as follows:
Theme — Second Person Object — Negative — . . .
The initial -a- of the suffix, when added directly to the theme,
obscures the form of the final theme element causing its vowel to be
-a- in either the full or reduced form.
yagb-ab-o'c
geigab-ab-o'
yagb-abe-no'c
yagb-abe-nec'o'cI do not hit him
he does not hit me
I am not hitting him
we two do not hit himWhen the verb takes the second person object, the vowel -a- of the
suffix is lengthened.
yagba'b-o'c
yagba-be-no'c
weigaba'be-no'c
yagb&be-nec'o'cI do not hit you
I am not hitting you
I am not hitting you people
we two do not hit youI t is probable t h a t -abe- is an incorporated form of the adverb
gabai not, nothing, though no such relationship can be proven.
54. The Mode-less Paradigm.
I n its simplest form, this paradigm is not only modeless b u t
tense-less as well. I t is formed by adding the subject pronouns
directly to the theme and is found only in the first person singular,
dual, and plural.

'egwancxau-ca'gen nenxalee I've found my horse, nenxdle- to find . . . . Coyote,
seeing Rabbit lying asleep by the side of the road, makes the above
remark and pounces on him.","[91, 92]"
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A NLANGUAGES67with a club, the -dje might be considered a verbalizer and -xw (the
reduced form of -xwe) may refer to action with a club or possibly
to the noun ""club"" itself. Therefore, ""to do by means of clubbing""
or ""to strike by means of a club"". This feeling for -dje as a verbalizer
is strengthened by the fact t h a t it is dropped in the compound
yaxw-nadjga- to kill . . . by means of a club (-nadjga- to kill).
Here, the verb -nadjga- seems to take the place of -dje, substituting
a different verbal activity for t h a t of striking.
There are other verb themes which could be brought forward on
this point but these are the most illustrative and convincing. I t is
apparent t h a t the evidence as a whole is not entirely convincing:
we have, for example, no analagous forms with we-, ha-, or na- to
show the precise effects these elements have on the themes they
appear to modify (cf. 28—32).
I n conclusion, then, we can only submit the above scheme as a
tentative explanation of the variations in theme form discussed
in the preceding sections. I t is not possible to do more with the
evidence at hand. Possibly evidence from related languages, if such
are still extant, will aid in clarifying the theme morphology of
Tonkawa: until such evidence is available, I am convinced t h a t
only tentative hypotheses such as this one can be advanced to
interpret the data.
b. THEME A F F I X E S (40—82)
(1) The Pronominal Affixes(40—46)40. General Remarks.
Under this heading, we propose to discuss only the pronominal
forms affixed to the verb. The independent personal pronouns, the
demonstratives, and the interrogative pronouns will be separately
treated in sections 89-92. There, also, will be discussed the possessive
pronouns which are normally expressed separately. In a few relationship terms, however, the possessive pronoun is prefixed to the noun:
these exceptional cases will be covered in the section on the kinship
terms (cf. 93—95).
The only pronouns affixed to the verb theme, then, are those of
the subjective and objective series. Both of these are, upon occasion,
also expressed separately: this is done for emphasis (cf. 89—92).
The object pronouns, except for t h a t of the second person, are
prefixed and occur as the first prefixes of a verb complex. The
second person pronoun object is suffixed. The subject pronouns are
all suffixed and generally occur in final position. I n the subjective
series, the singular, dual, and plural are distinguished; the latter
two by distinctive suffixes unconnected with those for the personal
pronoun. Only the plural is recognized in the objective series.
5*68HOIJER TONKAWAThe order in which the pronouns occur both with respect to each
other and to the other units of the verb complex is as follows:
First person singular, first person plural, or plural object pronouns —
Theme Prefixes —Theme—Theme Suffixes—Second Person Object—
Dual or Plural Subject — Theme Suffixes — First, second or third
person subjects — Theme Suffixes (in some cases).
41. The Objective Series.
There is but one objective series. The indirect object is expressed
by suffixing the post-position -da- to the pronouns listed below
(cf. 48).
Person
Singular
Plural
gegeu- (ge-we-)

-•we-. ...-•-...

weThe single element pronoun prefixes (ge- me, and we- plural object),
when attached directly to the theme, upset the phonetic balance
of its elements, causing reduced theme elements to become full and
vice versa.
yagb -o'c
ge-igab -o'
we-igah -o'cI hit him
he hits me
I hit themWhen, however, another theme prefix has been added the pronoun
prefix has no such effect.
xa-igab -o'c
ge-xa-igab -o'
we-xa-igab -o'cI hit him with force
he hits me with force
I hit them with forceIn the above examples, xa- with force, a theme prefix, has been
added to the theme yagba- to hit, and has upset the balance of
elements. The addition of the pronominal prefixes has, therefore,
no effect upon the theme.
Only one of the pronominal prefixes (we- plural object) appears
in other than the full form. In the object pronoun geu- us, it has the
form -u. Whether or not the others may be reduced cannot be
decided since no single elements prefix ever precedes the pronominal
object. When the prefix geu- us, is attached directly to the theme,
the theme elements remain unaffected due to the fact that geu- is a
two element prefix.
geu-yagb-o'he hits usThe second person pronoun always appears as an increment of
length to the vowel of the preceding element. If the precedingHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A NLANGUAGES69element is of t h e theme, it is lengthened whether in t h e full or
reduced form.
yagba'-we'c
we-igaba""-we'I hit you
I hit yeShould t h e preceding element be of t h e theme and already long, due
to a previous contraction, the addition of the second person pronoun
will cause t h e contraction to resolve itself into its component parts.
nec-'e'da'-we'c
nec-'e-daha'-we'I make him come
he makes you come-da•-, in t h e first form, represents -da-ha. I n t h e second form, t h e
pronoun object lengthens t h e vowel of -ha- forcing it t o resume its
identity.
Certain theme suffixes with long vowels, however, do not behave
in this m a n n e r when t h e length for the second person object is
added. I n those cases, t h e suffixation of the second person object
makes t h e vowel tri-moric.

"We have now presented all the available evidence for the partition
of the theme. The evidence, though scattered and largely incapable
of generalization, is enough, it seems to me, to justify an hypothesis
concerning the possible process involved in theme structure.
First, it is quite apparent that there are a number of first position
elements sufficiently represented to indicate that they are not
fortuitous similarities but are the vestiges of a once more complete
list of prefixes governing the relation between the other elements of
the theme. It seems likely that there are three classes of elements —
or groups of elements — used in constructing themes. These are,
in order of their occurrence, prefixes (such as ya-, Tie-, ha-, he-, and
possibly na-), stem elements, and suffixes (such as -'a, -'e, -we, -ne,
etc.). Not all themes, however, have now or ever had at an earlier
time all of these elements. I t is more likely that a typological
classification of themes can be made — somewhat as follows.
A. Themes identical with stems. This section would include such
themes as mama- to carry, pack. . ., cLobo- to c u t . . . , 'ege- to give
to . . . , djexe- to loosen, untie . . . , and many others. There are
indications that even these simple forms can be broken up —
perhaps into two units, one defining the class of the object, and the
other the action itself. There is not, however, enough evidence of
such partition on which to construct a tenable hypothesis.
B. Themes composed of stem and suffix. Included here would be
such themes as ha--na- one person goes away, da-na- two persons
go away, wa~-na- to fall forwards, ga~-na- to throw . . . away,
x'ax'ai-'a- to laugh (x'ax'ai- considered a reduplicated form of a
complex element x'ai-), m'e-l-ne- to be alight, burning, t'cei-'e- to
be jealous of . . . , and others.
These would seem to be old nouns or verb participals compounded
with the elements we have described as verbalizers (cf. 34). In only
a few cases, as was seen in section 34, can these verbalizers be
definitely isolated: our hypothesis must rest on those cases and be
judged accordingly.
C. Themes composed of prefix, stem, and suffix. This is, theoretically, a refinement on class B. There a direct relationship exists
between stem and suffix, the latter activizing the former. Here that
relationship is, theoretically again, modified by the initial element
of the theme. Thus, in such a theme as ya-din-'e- to scrape . . .
(a hide), -din- may be an old word for the act of scraping or doing
with a scraper, -e the verbalizer, and ya- an element establishing
an instrumental relationship between -din- and -e. Therefore, the
form would be translatable, literally, ""to do by means of scraping""
or ""to scrape . . . (a hide)"". Or, in the verb ya-xw -dje- to strike . . .",[76]
"Notice, in the last list, that the reduplicated forms repeat the second
element of the theme.
This variation in phonetic behavior taken in connection with the
first example quoted on page 40 would seem to indicate that haplus another initial theme element of the class of na- does not
elide according to the law of vocalic elision, whereas ha- attached
directly to a theme does vary phonetically according to this rule.
In other words, the themes of the first list seem to contain traces
of other theme elements of the wa-class: perhaps, at one time, there
was a complete list of such elements classifying various types of
object. This is, of course, only a suggestion: no further proof of
such an organization can be adduced.
The test forms for ha- are more definitive than any discussed
heretofore. For example:
yagonaha'gona-to hit . . . with the fist tr.
to box intr. (ha- plus ya- >yaxgocaha'xaxgoca-to follow . . . tr.
several go in single fileyadcaha'daca-to stab . . . tr.
several stab each other; a fight with
knives takes placeha--)In all of these forms, the addition of ha- appears to confine the
action to an object expressed within the theme: to make the action
intransitive as far as the English translation is concerned. We have
seen, however, that Tonkawa verbs do not fall into definitely
transitive and intransitive classes: that there appears to be no
consistently formal distinction between transitive and intransitive
verbs in Tonkawa. Rather, the question of transitivity seems bound
up with the analysis of the theme. Thus, while hangaba- is transitive
in the sense that it may take an object (ga-ngabo' it sticks to me;
hangaba-we' it sticks to you), the subject is limited to a certain
type of object apparently once clearly defined by na-, and ha- does
not affect the transitivity of the whole verb theme but expresses an42HOIJEB, TONKAWAindirect relationship between the elements -n- and -gaba- of the
theme. In other words, the question of the transitivity of the whole
theme with regard to an object expressed by a theme affix is bound
up with the relationship — direct, indirect, or instrumental —
between elements of the theme. I do not believe, therefore, that hais necessarily an element indicating the intransitivity of the whole
theme (indeed, that point is contradicted by many of the hathemes), but that it has to do with the more important relations
between elements of the theme in much the same way as ya- and neappear to serve this function. The curious and apparently contradictory facts of theme variation discussed so far can, at least
speculatively, be explained by postulating two theme elements
either standing in direct relationship one to another (the prefixless themes) or being indirectly related by one or other of the first
position themes elements (ha-, ne-, ya- themes). It is not necessary
of course, to assume that all themes have both these elements —
some of the prefix-less themes may be composed of only one;
others, which appear transitive, may have a limited transitivity
due to the inclusion within its structure of an element designating
or referring to a possible object (cf. 28). This theory of theme structure cannot be proven: but, as I have said, it appears to be an
hypothesis that does justice to the few test forms that exist. In the
following sections, we shall find further confirmation, or, rather,
further indications that this theory has some degree of validity.
32. he- Themes.
The element he- is on the border line between the first position
theme elements which have been discussed and the theme prefixes.
In fact, there is no formal difference between he- and the reflexive
pronoun he- (cf. 43) except that the themes containing the theme
element he- cannot be used without it. he- also does not elide its
vowel when preceded by a single element prefix, a behavior
characteristic of theme prefixes.
he falls down
hedjn -o'
ge'djn -o'
I . . . (ge- + he- > ge'-)
There are a great number of themes in this class — it is the second
largest group of themes in Tonkawa, the largest class being the
prefix-less themes. The following list is arranged in order of increasing complexity of theme form, the simplest coming first. Since
these themes have no reduced forms — or, rather, since their reduced forms are the same as the full forms — only two forms will
be given for each theme — the full form and the reduplicated form.

to stretch one's neckIt will be seen from the above list that he- appears to give a
medio-passive significance to the theme — limiting the action to
the subject. It is evident, however, that this factor does not affect
the ultimate transitivity of the whole theme. For, though most of
the themes are intransitive or confined to a reflexive object, one44HOIJER TONKAWAof them (e. g., hendaidja- to chew) is transitive. It is possible here
that -n- is the reduced form of -na-, the incorporated object (cf. 28),
and that the verb is therefore limited in transitivity. Just to what
spheres of influence these different elements are confined and how
they combine to result in the present meanings, cannot, of course,
be determined since we are unable to isolate the other theme elements. As was the case with ya-, ne-, and ha-, it is quite possible
that the function of he- is bound up with that of the other theme
elements and not with the formal relations of the whole theme to
its object.
The test forms following confirm the impression that he- gives
medio-passive significance to the theme.
daVewhe-dai'ew,ei-dai'ew-to be one of a group

group; I am in the group; cf. 42), the second, medio-passively, and
the third is transitivized by the element 'ei- (cf. 33). Other test
forms follow:
he-nc'o'ido'ei-noc'o'idohv-n&idxzw'a'ei-nedidxew'a-to stretch oneself

"27. The Two and Three Element Themes.
In this section we shall list examples of the two and three element
themes (excluding, of course, those three element themes requiring
prefixes of any sort). These will be presented in order of increasing
complexity with the simplest types first. Whenever possible, three
forms will be given for each theme; the full form (i. e., the theme not
preceded by a theme affix), the reduced form (its form when preceded by a single element theme prefix, cf. 5), and the reduplicated
form.

"26HOIJER TONKAWA22. Compounding.
Compounding is very free in Tonkawa. Almost any two verb
themes may be compounded and compounds of noun and modifier
are very common. In all such compounds, the second theme is
subordinate to the first. Examples:
ga'n-aidjonayagau-nadjgahedaVo'-he'cogyawyag-xailahagwe'-necdjodan
t'caxw-yabetcto throw (it) up (haidjona- to
move up)
to kick to death (-nadjga- to kill;
cf. 33)
to join in a fight, war (he'cogyawto fight)
to shoot (e. g. an arrow) into (the ground)
(xailah- to stick (a pointed object)
in (the ground)
pencil (gwer stick, necdjodan writing)
thread (t'caxw cloth, yabetc sewing)A classification of compounds according to type and more examples
of them will be found in sections 36 and 85.
As will appear later, the function of theme formation has been
lost in Tonkawa. All new ideas are expressed by compounding old
themes: as far as I can determine, no new themes have been formed
in the language for a very long time. It will appear, however, from
what little can be told of theme formation, that probably composition has always been important in theme formation. Themes seem
to be composed of smaller morphologic units (cf. 39); in an early
stage of the language, it may have been that such smaller units were
compounded to form the present themes. In the present state of the
language, we find compounds in all stages of growth — those of
two themes, either of which can stand alone; compounds in which
only one theme has an independent existence; and, finally, those
in which both themes have lost independent status. The latter are
classed as compounds because they follow a definite pattern of
behavior characteristic of compounds (cf. 36). More detailed material
will be presented on this subject in section 36: it is only mentioned
here for the purpose of showing the importance of composition as a
grammatical process.","[35, 36]"
"XHOIJER TONKAWATonkawa is now spoken by only six persons — all of them past
middle age. There are approximately forty Tonkawa (including
mixed bloods) who are living at present in the vicinity of Tonkawa,
Oklahoma. The language is not being learned by any of the younger
people and, with the death of the present speakers, will become
extinct.
The following account of the language is based upon about
360 manuscript pages of text with accompanying grammatical
forms. All of this material was obtained from one informant, John
Rush Buffalo, who has the reputation among his people of being
the best of their story tellers. Most of this information was gathered
during the summer of 1928: additional material being obtained in
the winter of 1928 and on two subsequent visits. The work was
financed by the Committee on Linguistic Research in American
Indian Languages, and I am grateful to the members of t h a t
Committee — Dr. Franz Boas, Dr. Edward Sapir, and Dr. Leonard
Bloomfield — for their interest and cooperation. Dr. John R. Swanton of the Bureau of American Ethnology very kindly sent me his
copy of the Tonkawa material collected by A. S. Gatschet in 18841.
The kinship terminology included in this paper was collected by
Dr. Alexander Lesser of Columbia University. I am particularly
indebted to Dr. Sapir for his careful reading of the manuscript
and the constructive criticisms he has unfailingly supplied.

The Tonkawa appear to have been an important and warlike
tribe living in central Texas during most of the 18th and 19th
centuries. From the scanty accounts of their culture which have
come down to us through mission and governmental reports, they
were a nomadic people living on the buffalo. Their myths and
stories, of which I have collected about thirty, give indications
of their dependence upon buffalo and deer, and, insofar as this sort
of evidence is reliable, indicate a Plains type of culture. A more
complete account of their culture — or, rather, of what little is
known of their ethnological relations — may be found in the Handbook of the American Indian, B. A. E. Bulletin 30, part 2, under
the heading ""Tonkawa"".
The name ""Tonkawa"" is supposed by Gatschet to be derived
from a Waco word tonkaweya meaning ""they will stay together.""
I am unable to verify or disprove this etymology. The Tonkawa call
themselves didjganwa-didj, which may be translated as ""the
people.""
Powell, in his linguistic classification, considered t h a t the Tonkawa
language formed an independent linguistic stock, i. e., was unrelated
to any other American Indian language. Certain lesser tribes — the
Yojuane, Mayeye, and Ervipianne — were certainly associated in
culture and may have spoken languages related to Tonkawa. I have
not had access to the material extant on these languages. Certain
other small tribes, notably the Sana (sometimes written Zana and
Chana), situated between the Tonkawa and the Coahuiltecan
speaking groups, may also have spoken a language related to
Tonkawa. Only fragmentary material on Sana is extant. Relationship between Tonkawa and the Coahuiltecan languages has been
postulated: the difficulty of proving any such relationship lies in
the scarcity of material on the Coahuiltecan languages, a difficulty
that cannot, unfortunately, be remedied since these languages are
now extinct.
The language groups mentioned above are probably the closest
to Tonkawa. There is also a possibility that it is very distantly
related to languages of the so-called Hokan group. I have not had
the opportunity of making an adequate investigation of this
possibility. So far as this work is concerned, then, it will.be necessary
to consider Tonkawa as an independent language: as one for which
no cognates have been proven.","[7, 8, 9]"

meaning ""only, just"". For ten the word is simply cik. All the
numbers except two, three, and five, are, then, based on the theme
cik. The word for six seems to be cik plus gwa-lau; the latter resembling
the adjective gwa-lou big, large. Nine is formed by compounding cik
plus we-'ic one, and xw'e-l'a, which resembles the theme xw'e-l- to
miss (a mark in shooting). In the word for seven, the suffix is
unknown; the word for eight is cigid four, plus an unknown suffix.
The theme cik corresponds to nothing else in the language.
The teens are formed as follows:
cikbax-'enmed'ic-'enthirteenThe suffix -'en is the conjunctive suffix for nouns which has been
discussed in section 86. The word thus reads ""ten and three"" =
""thirteen"". Twenty is formed by saying two tens; thirty by three

becomes Co• and the noun suffix -n.

76. General Remarks.
The modal suffixes added to the -k form of the theme may, in
most cases, also be added to nouns, adjectives or demonstratives.
The modes so formed are the declarative, interrogative, resultative,
hortatory, quotative, and certain subordinated modes.
77. The Declarative -au, -a-we.
The declarative formed by adding -au to the -k form of the verb
differs from the ordinary declarative in t h a t it defines a completed
action. I t is ordinarily tenseless but may be used with the future
tense suffix. Examples:
didjgan-galalc-gageu'eiweidja-k-authe enemy have caught ushedjw'ax 'eye'-no-k-au something has happened to you
'egwan-wixwan-la hewawa-k-au a little dog has died

cases, it defines a static notion. Examples:
hedjodjxo'-k-la geucog-au a bad one owns us (cog- to put away)
de'l heilab-au she is standing right hereheidicnan-au she is bashfuldjagau-e'e'-k-au where the creek is

yadalban-gwa'lou-lahedjn-au a big loaf of bread is lying thereI t appears very likely t h a t -au is a form of the auxiliary yem- to be,
which has become specialized in usage. I n support of this the
paradigm for ye'- in the present tense of the declarative mode is
appended.

singular which is the same as the modal enclitic described above
in form, and is probably cognate with it. Note, also, the curious
positions of the dual and plural subject elements which here come
before the theme itself. This phenomenon is unique with this
paradigm.
78. The Interrogatives, -ye, and -ye-lgwa.
-ye, added to the -k form of the verb, may be translated ""have
(you) done . . . "" ; while -ye%lgwa means ""are (you) certain of . . . "" ,
or ""do (you) assert t h a t . . . "" . Both may take the interrogative
suffix which is dropped when the form is preceded by an interrogative pronoun. The text forms available are nearly all preceded
by interrogative pronouns. Examples:
hededj '-a'do-nek-ye hedjw'ax-ei-ga nengoxo-l'ok what will you do if someone
chases you ?

probably basic since, in these paradigms, which are tenseless and
modeless, the pronoun was protected both from the influence of
accompanying mode suffixes and the final position.
The absence of third person pronoun subjects in so many paradigms leads to the belief that there is no such person recognized in
Tonkawa but that the forms given are absolutive forms idiomatically used for the third person. The presence of -I- as third person
pronoun in some paradigms does not necessarily contradict this
because the -I- may well be cognate with the nominative case suffix
of the noun -la (cf. 86). With no comparative material available,
however, such generalizations, based, as they are, on the evidence
of one language, carry little weight.",[84]

The element ne- is similar to na- in phonetic structure — t h a t is,
it is a simple element •— but it seems to have a different position
in the verb theme. This point is illustrated by only one example:
na-m'ene-to broil . . .ne-n -m'ene-to roast, barbecue . . .but there are a number of themes similar in structure to the second
form above. For none of these, however, are the primary forms

Vocatives are in a number of cases distinguished by a change of
final vowel, accompanied in some cases by a shift of accent. In some

i-; these forms were used by Coachina Rush with the regular

I was unable to duplicate any of the vocative forms obtained by
Dr. Lesser. This does not, however, disprove those forms: my informant was but poorly versed in the kinship terminology. I t may
also be mentioned that no other nouns in the language have vocative
forms.
I did, however, record the addition of ""the initial i-"" mentioned
by Dr. Lesser for the third person forms. In my transcriptions, it
appears as 'e- and my be used in other than the third person

(there)The suffix -laic is very often used independently or, at least, semiindependently, to set off certain word groupings. Its exact function
in this connection will best be explained by a few examples. Thus,
'e-l'ok 'a-x-'a--la x'adon--dak ye-la-k-lakno'o lak wa-y'ik 'e-da
ha-'ago-n-ocac-wa--'a--la hadjxo-k-lakno'o which, translated literally,
means: but the water very blue there was lak from this then that
young man arose it is said. The young man was a magician and had
turned himself into a patch of intensely blue water: his wife, looking
for him, could not see him but saw 'this patch of very blue water
from which that young man arose'. I t appears, then, that lak makes
the phrase 'a-x-'a--la x'adon--dak ye-la-k-lakno'o "" a (patch of) very
blue water was lying"" the object of 'e-l'ok which, as was shown in
section 38, is a particle based on the auxiliary verb: to be, to do.
Therefore, a free translation is ""(she did not see him) but (saw) a
patch of very blue water lying there from which, then, the young
man arose"", hadxilna-l-'ok ha-djcogonai-la heilab-e-la-k-lakno'o lak
da-dagxona-k-lakno'o when she went out Coyote was standing lak,
she brought him in, it is said. Here again lak refers the phrase
""Coyote was standing"" to the verb ""when she went out"" so that,
translated freely, the sentence means, ""when she went out (she saw
or noticed) Coyote standing (there); she brought him in, it is said"".
In the examples to follow, the phrase objectified by lak will be
put in parenthesis.

objectified phrase (i. e., the phrase in parentheses) has compounded
with is the reduced form -e*- of the auxiliary ye-- to be (cf. 38);
and is, therefore, a static verb. The part of the expression in parentheses is this static verb and this totality is referred to the active
verb preceding by the element lak.
II. The Dative Suffixes.
There are, as we have seen, two dative suffixes. The former one
a-y'ik, is most commonly used. It carries with it an ""endpoint""
notion; the concept of ""(arriving) at, to, in (a certain point)"". The
other, -'a'-w'an (used mostly with verbs of going) implies a motion
towards an indirect object. Examples:
t'cagau-'a'-y'ik

(Note that -'a'-w'an is used instead of - ' a ' - y ' i k , showing that he did
not actually lie down by the woman but simply started to do so and
was stopped.)
na'don-'a'-lak
necgaldei-'a'-w'an
yag-xailaha-k-lakno'o

in the ground on the other side of the mountain, it is said
(-'a'-w'an
is suffixed to the word meaning 'other side': he shot
towards the other side so that the arrow would be stuck in the ground.)III. Instrumental Suffixes.
These are distinguished for definite and indefinite (indefinite -ec,
definite a--lac) and there occurs, but rarely, a plural definiteform (-a'-gai).","[124, 125, 126]"
"18. Suffixes Containing more than One Element.
These suffixes are peculiar in that they all have a definite effect
upon the preceding element. If the preceding element happens to
be a theme element, the addition of the suffix usually obscures its
form. There are three types of suffixes.
The first of these types includes only one suffix — that denoting
the second person object pronoun. I t is unique in that it is always
elided and is expressed b y simply lengthening the vowel of the
preceding element. When the preceding element is of the theme, it
is lengthened whether in the even or odd numbered position. Thus:
ya'dje'we'cI see y o uHere -dje'- is in the third position and should have the full form —
its length is due to the addition of the unknown element for the
second person pronoun object.
yagwa'we'cI kick y o uIn this example, -gwar- is in the second position and should have the
reduced form. T h a t it is long indicates that the second person pronoun
object causes the vowel of the preceding element both to remain and
be lengthened. That the vowel belongs to the preceding element and
not to the pronoun object can be seen by the fact that the long vowel
is -a'- in this example and -em- in the preceding one. Other examples:
'adnawa'we'c
'adnawa'no'c
nadje'we'c
'ei-camxe'we'c
'ei-wecmaxe'we'cI like y o u
I am liking y o u
I bite y o u
I break your head
I break your (plural) headsA second class of suffixes — including those for the dual and plural
subject — simply cause the vowel of the preceding element to
remain. When the preceding element is of the theme — its form is
thereby obscured.
necgabanec'o'cwe two shut it-ba- is in the fourth position and should have the reduced form were
it not for the dual subject suffix -nee?- following.
h&ngamenec'o'cwe two clench our fists-me- is also in the fourth position but full because of the following
suffix. Note, too, that the vowel is -a- in the preceding example andHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES21-e- in this one, indicating that it belongs to the preceding theme
element rather than to the suffix -nee'-.
mwganec'o'cwe two weep-ga-, in the third position, is full both for that reason and b y reason
of the -nec'- following.","[30, 31]"
"It will be noted, in all the above forms, that the themes themselves
(viz., -dai'ew-,-noc'o-ido-,and -nedidxew'a-) are not transitive butrequire the transitivizing element 'ei-. The function of he-, therefore,
seems to be to direct the action to the subject. If it is the reflexive
pronoun, it is evident that certain verbs can be confined — as
regards transitivity — to the reflexive: that the reflexive pronoun
is not functionally similar in type to the other object pronouns
(cf. 41). There is a possibility here that themes requiring he- were
originally simply transitive themes used exclusively with the reflexive pronoun: that, in harmony with the petrification that has
affected the Tonkawa themes, this he- prefix has become an irremovable theme element and, that, in the few forms in which the
theme can dispense with it, the theme is felt as intransitive. Whatever the cause, there seems to be little doubt that he- themes
generally designate an action intransitive except as regards the
reflexive: i. e., a medio-passive construction.",[54]
"/'e'nola
when'e-l'ok (4)I t happenediwdon-'a'y'ikto a mountainna'don-wa'-a--that mountain(1) Coyote is said to be the owner of all the earth; his permission
was invoked by hunters when they invaded new hunting grounds.
The word is a compound of ha'dj land, surrounding country, and the
verb theme cogona- to own, put away, which has apparently a suffix
-i. It is possible that this final element is cognate with the -i element
listed for nouns in section 84 and is to be interpreted as a noun forming
suffix. There are, however, no other examples of such an alternation.
-la is the nominative indefinite singular case suffix. It is notable
that, all through the texts, the word ""Coyote"" always takes the
indefinite form of the case suffix and is never followed by the
demonstrative wa~- that . . . aforementioned. No other character in
the myths is described in this manner.
(2) Theme: ha-- one person moves, goes, plus -na directive suffix,
off, away (cf. 34). Theme suffixes: -no continuative, -k participial
suffix, and -lakno'o narrative suffix (cf. 81).
This text selection illustrates nicely the wide usage of narrative
forms so characteristic in Tonkawa. Note that every verb not
employed in direct discourse or having subordinate function has this
suffix. The suffix indicates that the events recounted were not
participated in by the raconteur but that he is repeating the story
told him by others, who, in their turn, had it from some one else, etc.
If the story had been the experience of the one who told it to the
present teller the quotative suffix would be used (cf. 81).
(3) ""when, ascending a mountain, he was standing (there), it
is said"". The indirect relationship of na-don mountain, to the verb
haidjona- one person goes up, is expressed by -a-y'ik (cf. 86). The
-d suffix of haidjona- subordinates it to the following verb heilabato stand. 'e--no-la, a particle based upon the auxiliary V - to be, do
(cf. 38), links the first phrase with the second thus, ""Coyote was
going along, it is said, when it happened that he, ascending a
mountain, stood (there), it is said"". The continuative forms of the
principal verbs add a connotation of customary activity: according
to the myths, Coyote spends most of his time wandering about and
intruding upon the affairs of others.
(4) 'e'-l-'ok as it happened: V-, the auxiliary, plus the third person
form of the subordinating suffix -'ok (cf. 66). The particle here refers141HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGESlak (5)'a-yai-a-y'ik (6)yadjox'an-a-naxokye-laklakno'o{l)below (it)a large campthere was, it isaforementionedlak I ha-djcogonai-lahaglanadyadjox'an-a-naxole-wa--y'iksaid.","[150, 151]"

be translated ""to pick, gather together several objects progressively

(These terms and uses were obtained in 1929 from Coachina
Rush, reputed to be the most informed Tonkawa then alive, in the
course of an afternoon's work and part of another, without the
assistance of interpreters. As a result it was impossible to avoid
inconsistencies and errors due to misunderstandings. The terms
were sent to Dr. Hoijer in the hope t h a t he would have an opportunity to complete and correct this record. Without such completion,
it has proved impossible to overcome the inconsistencies of some
usages given by Coachina Rush, so that the Tonkawa ""system""
can not be said to be controlled. As it now appears that this list
may prove our final word on kinship usages of the Tonkawa, I have
recompiled my notes so t h a t in the following the usages given by
Coachina Rush, inconsistent as a number of them are, are preserved
as recorded. — A. Lesser).
Consanguinities
Own Generation:
Siblings:
hi'na (he-na'); hineH voc., brother, m. s. (man speaking)
ya'na (ya-na'); yani' voc., sister, w. s. (woman speaking)
o'la ('o-l'a'); olevoc.,
sibling of opposite sex.
Relative age is expressed by the addition of ""small"" and ""large"":
hi'na wi'xwan (he-na' wixwan)
younger brother
hi'na kwa'lo (he-na' gwa-lou)
older brother,
and similarly for ""sister"", and ""sibling of opposite sex"".
Also given:
i'xi'nai
brother.
Sibling terms are used for parallel cousins.
Sibling terms are used between relatives four generations removed
(great-grandparent: great-grandchild generation). Thus parents
of ego's ka'ka, Jca'sa, or kata' are siblings; and children of ego's
ka'ka, ka'sa, kata', or tca-'xwa are siblings.
Cross-Cousins:
Usages secured were inconsistent. On one occasion Coachina
implied t h a t all cross-cousins, like parallel cousins, were siblings.
At other times the following usages were given:
cahau' (cahau) father's sister's daughter, w. s.
ta'wa (da-'wa') father's sister's son, w. s.","[139, 140]"
"/'e-klaha-djcogonai -lahagxonad (9)ThenCoyotegoing inthe preceding action to that which is to come — note that all the
rest of the sentence is objectified by lak (cf. 86). The sentence reads,
then, ""as it happened there was a large camp below that mountain
lak"" and the function of lak is to refer this fact to that of Coyote
standing on the mountain. Freely translated, ""as it happened
(Coyote saw that) there was a large camp below that mountain"".
(5) The demonstrative w - that . . . aforementioned, is used here
because the mountain has already been mentioned: to omit the
demonstrative would be to imply that the speaker was referring to
another mountain.
(6) 'a-yai here has nominal function. Compare this usage with that
in line 3, page 141, where it has adjectival function (cf. 83, 87).
(7) yadjox'-an camp, tipi, is formed from the verb theme yadjox' 'ato build a tipi, by the noun forming suffix -an (cf. 75).
The combination yadjox'an-a-naxok needs no case suffix since
it is followed by the auxiliary verb ye-- to be, and the whole is
interpreted as a static verb, ""to be a big camp"", ye'-la-k-lakno'o is
the third person form of the auxiliary in the -k paradigm plus the
narrative enclitic. I t will be seen that this is an irregular third person
form, -la- being the third person suffix (compare with the -k
paradigm in section 74 and the ye-- paradigm for the present tense
of the declarative mode in section 77).
(8) This sentence is remarkable for the number of subordinate
phrases: ""Coyote, descending, arriving at that big camp aforementioned, as he arrived at the last (tipi), they were weeping, it is said,
inside that tipi"".
-wa~- is used with yadjox'an-a-naxok since it has been mentioned
before (cf. note 5).
xa-xa- one person arrives, is analyzable as xa-ha--xa-; xa- (from,
to) a distance; ha-- one person moves, goes; -xa arrival suffix
(cf. 34).
holau last, is here used as a noun. The idiom is curious: it is really
the first tipi that Coyote comes to but the last with reference to the
camp (i. e., a tipi on the outskirts of the camp).
xa-xa-l-ok, cf. 66 and note 4.
Note the meaning of 'a-yai in the complex yadjox1 an- a-yai-142HOIJER TONKAWA""hedju• 'e-gwa"" (10)

Literally, the expression means ""under the
tipi"". Cf. note 6. Compare the meaning of yadjox'an tipi, here with
its meaning of ""camp"" in line 1, page 141. Probably yadjox'ana-naxok is better interpreted as ""many tipis"" than as ""big camp"".
ma-ga- to weep, -no continuative suffix.
(9) Three locative themes have now been illustrated in this text:
ha-idjo-na- one person goes up (line 2, page 140), ha-gla-na- one
person goes down (line 2, page 141), and ha-gxo-na- one person goes
in. These have been discussed and listed in section 34.
(10) hedju• what ? (cf. 92); 'e~-gwa, auxiliary V - to be, do, plus the
mode suffix -gwa (cf. 58).
(11) gwa-n woman, -wa~- that aforementioned. The demonstrative
is used because the woman was mentioned by implication in the
expression, ""they were weeping, it is said"" in line 4, page 141.
(12) ""there are no people in all of this camp"".
de--w'an towards this (way); de-- this, plus the dative (towards)
suffix (cf. 91).
yadjox'an-dana-de--la. The suffix or theme -dana- cannot be
explained: it occurs in no other connection.
didjgan person, plus -a--ga, nominative definite plural case suffix.
gab- is probably a reduced form of the modifier gabai no, nothing,
plus -a~we, the declarative modal enclitic (cf. 77).
The meaning of the sentence is, then, ""towards this direction,
this is an uninhabited (people-less) camp"": the speaker is probably
gesturing towards the camp (her tipi being on the edge) while
speaking. It is possible that -dana- is related to the verb theme
dana- several go off, and that the sentence means ""going off in this
direction the camp is uninhabited"". If so, this is a unique example
of a noun plus verb compound (cf. 85).
(13) hedjodjxo--k, probably hedjodjxo-- to be frightened, plus the
participial suffix -k (cf. 74). The word would then mean ""frightening, fearsome"" rather than ""evil"".
(14) we-, third person plural object, -doxa- to finish, do completely,
-re-, continuative, and -o'o, third person singular of the past tense of
the declarative mode, do-xa-, -doxa- is used idiomatically to mean
""to kill"": ordinarily it is found compounded with other themes, thus
'e'eyau-do-xa- to finish working ('e'eyaw- to work).","[151, 152]"
"HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES39There is the same difficulty with the test forms involving the
ya- element as we found in the case of the other two elements: they
are not sufficiently definitive. Take, for example, the following
comparison:
nec-digeya-dge-, -i -dig-to be cold, freezing
to be frozen stiff-dige- is not used alone but, since it appears with nee-, the causative
theme prefix (cf. 50), it can be defined ""to freeze, chill, be cold"".
But the use of ya- with the same theme does not alter the meaning
in a manner helpful to a definition of ya-.
gam,namwaya-ga'na'wa-to throw . . . with the hand (e. g. to
throw a ball, stick, etc.)
to swing (e. g. on a rope swing)In this example, it may be seen that ya- appears to establish a
relation between the other elements of the theme. If we assume the
complex -na-wa- to mean ""moving through space (as if thrown)""
and ga~- to refer to an act of propelling or throwing (perhaps related
to ga--na- to throw . . . away, and ga~-da- to throw . . . towards the
speaker, where -na and -da are the directives, cf. 34), then yawould appear to establish an instrumental relationship between the
second and third elements of the theme. Thus, the whole form would
have the meaning ""to move through space by reason of throwing
(pushing, some means of propulsion)"" or, ""to swing"". The case is
necessarily weak since we cannot offer any evidence for the meaning
of the second part of the theme complex.
yaxwdjeyaxw-nadjga-to strike . . . with a club
to beat . . . to death with a clubNotice, in this pair of forms, that the third theme element -dje is
dropped when the theme is compounded with -nadjga- to kill. That
seems to imply that ya-xw- means ""by means of a club"" and -dje
""to strike"". In other words, ya- establishes an instrumental relationship between -dje ""to strike"" and -xwe- (the full form of -xw-)
referring to a club or stick. Unfortunately, there is no further
evidence for this analysis.
In conclusion, then, we are left with the feeling that ya- is a
separable theme element possibly serving to establish a type of
relationship between the second and third elements of the theme
similar in form to that postulated for ne-, though, in neither case,
have we conclusive proof.
31. ha- Themes.
ha- represents an element of quite a different class from any of
the preceding — at least, as far as phonetic behavior is concerned.
In the first place, it precedes both na- and ya- in the verb complex40HOIJER TONKAWAand therefore, by implication, precedes ne- though there are no test
forms illustrating its use with ne- themes.
hangaba-hanangaba-(e. g., leeches) stick, are fastened
to . . . ; to be stuck, caught fast
(on some sticky substance)
several objects (e. g., leeches) stick
to . . . ; it holds several fastThese examples, quoted before in section 28, illustrate the use of
ha- with a na- theme. It will be remembered that, in this case, haseemed to indicate an indirect relationship between na- and gaba-;
that the form was tentatively analyzed as: an object (na-) is
fastened (-gaba-) to (ha-)....
Another curious phase of phonetic
behavior may be illustrated by this verb.
hangab -o'
ga-ngab -o'(leech) sticks t o him
(leech) sticks to m eNotice here that the addition of the single element theme prefix gedoes not reverse the forms of the theme elements: -n-, -ga-, and -bahave the same form in the second example as they had in the first.
ha-, of course, is absorbed to the preceding prefix ge-, giving ga~(cf. 8). This behavior is characteristic of all ha- themes composed of
more than three elements (including ha-) . Note the following:
habdjen -o'
ga'bdjen -o'it is full
I am full; I
satisfiedhadxec -o'c
ga'dxec -o'I know h i m ; a m acquainted with

he . . . m ehaixoy -o'c

"62. The Potential Mode.
This mode is formed by adding the suffix -'a-- or -'ai- to the verb
form. The suffix has the form - V - in the first and second persons,
-ai- in the third. The potential is not differentiated as to tense and
cannot be used with the continuative suffix. The paradigm is as
follows:
ya.'dj-'a'-ri'ec
ya'dj-'a'-ri'ei
yardj-'ai-Va
ya'djenec'a-'a'-n'ec

in this exact form in no other paradigm. Another unique feature of
it is the indefinite third person pronoun that appears in the passive
form of this paradigm. The passive is formed as usual — using the
object pronoun as subject — except that an indefinite third person
form is suffixed instead of the regular third person.

"60HOIJER TOÍTKAWAnedjyaxe-, -nedjyaxe-, nedjidjyaxe- to shake out (a blanket,
clothes, etc.), and nedjlegwe-, -nedjlegwe- to wash (a blanket, clothes),
seem to have the complex element nedj- in common. I t may be that
these two verbs are old compounds but note t h a t the pronouns come
before the whole complex in each case and not between the two
elements of the theme.
ha'nadjidjxile-yandjidjxileyalxilnaya'ncxile-several persons run awayto run away
to run away
to runI n these forms, all meaning practically the same thing, we notice
the element -xile- as the only complex common to all four themes.
I t may be t h a t it is an old theme referring to direction which has
become fused to these themes expressing running. There is, however,
no way of proving this analysis.
'ei-gel'axe-, 'ei-gegeVaxe-to smash, shatter . . .'eibac'axe-, 'ei-babac'axe'ei-dam'axe-, 'ei-dadam'axe-to break, burst . . . by pressure
to smash . . . (glass, dishes)gai'axe-, gagai'axedol'axe-, dodol'axe-to out . . . off at a joint
to shell cornI n this set of themes, all have an element of the type CVC in the
first position and the complex -'axe- in the second two positions.
Notice, too, t h a t there is enough similarity in meaning to postulate
a relationship between them. I t is quite possible that - axe- refers
to breaking in a general sense and t h a t the first position elements
refine this concept to suit the particular occasion. Thus, gai- may
refer to cutting or chopping and we find it again in the theme,
'ei-gaidje-, 'ei-gagaidje- to c h o p . . . ; c u t . . . with an axe. In the same
way, the other first position elements may serve to refine the
meaning of the general complex -'axe- though we cannot adduce
any proof of this. I n short, it is a possible hypothesis t h a t these
themes are old compounds of smaller morphologic units which once
had a greater variability.
To conclude, then, the evidence presented in this section has
indicated t h a t the origins of some themes at least may be due to
compounds formed in an earlier period in the history of the language.
In preceding sections, other material has suggested that the theme,
though now indivisible, may have been, at one time, a combination
of elements each having certain definite functions and I think that
the indications presented in this section strengthen t h a t hypothesis
somewhat. I t is evident, however, that we shall not be able to prove
conclusively that such a process has occurred: that would require
either historical material or comparative material from languages
related to Tonkawa and both of these aids are lacking.","[69, 70]"

that at least one of the complex elements may be regarded as a
combination of simple element and suffix — or, as a combination
of two simple elements. The combination once made, however, is
treated as a unit: i. e., CV + CV = Co• is not comparable to the
ordinary combination of two simple elements.
This, of course, applies directly to only one type of the complex
element. No such demonstration is possible with the others. But it
is possible that other complex elements were, at one time, formed
in some such manner. As evidence that processes of this sort have
not entirely ceased functioning in the language, we may cite those
combinations of simple elements mentioned in section 8 where, it
will be remembered, the complete elision of an element was accomanied by the compensatory lengthening of the vowel of the element
ppreceding. Assuming, then, that such processes as are now extant
in the language may have contributed to the formation of complex
elements, we can divide the latter into two groups — those composed
of two parts and those built up of three component parts.

respectively, or may be considered as in the same category as type
GVw.","[25, 26, 27]"
"(3) Theme Suffixes(52—82)52. General Remarks.
All Tonkawa themes may be divided into two classes: those which
have meaning when used without formal suffixes, and those which
require formal suffixes to complete their meanings. Themes functioning as verbs fall largely into the latter class: the few verb
themes t h a t can stand without formal suffixes function as nouns
when so used (cf. 35). I n other words, all themes functioning as
verbs must employ one or more formal suffixes.",[90]
"These alternations cannot be explained. Only for the last two
terms (i. e., ya-na', he-na') was there a difference in usage. The first134HOIJER TONKAWAforms (ya-na', he-na'J were used with the regular possessive and the
possessives of the others were built as follows:

'ehen-'a'crlayour . . .,
his . . .,These m a y be analyzed as -we- to be, plus pronominal subject plus
participial -k plus the noun suffix for the nominative definite. They
could then be translated: the one who is . . . brother.
I n a few kinship terms, another type of possessive was used.

Some t e r m s exist with a constant possessive of the type illustrated
above.

For these terms, the possessive existed (in this form) only in the
first person : other possessives were formed in the regular way using
the alternates given above as bases.
E. Interjections and Curses(96)96. Interjections and Curses.
I. Interjections.
There are in Tonkawa two classes of interjections, the first comprising exclamations having fairly definite meaning and the second
including those expressive of emotional states. They are as follows.

'a'g ai

"For this verb there is some doubt as to the status of the element go-.
Note the following:
wo-g-m(o)-o'c
wo-go-m -o'cI have them in my mouth
I have them in m y mouthIn the first example the element -go- is elided as it should be if it is a
simple element. But the second example can also be used. This fact,
taken in connection with the reduplicated form of the element, lends
a certain weight to the theory that -go- is a complex element of the
type CV' which has lost the vocalic length of the full form and is
treated in some cases as a simple element. Doublets of this type are
very rare.

several sleep togetherIt appears, from this list of examples, that, with some exceptions, reduplications of the form CVCV occur most often when the
element is the first of the theme and that the other type of reduplication is confined to second position elements. This fact is born
out by the mass of my material: only one element, the ya- as
illustrated in yagwa- to kick, consistently taking the reduplicated8HOIJER TONKAWAform CVC in the first position. A contradiction, however, to the
notion that the type of reduplication may be dependent upon the
position of the element is that the reduplicated form of either type
is consistent no matter how the position of the element may change.
Thus, in the following examples :
dodobo'c
gedodobo'
yababxo'c
geibahxo'
nawewelo'c
wenwewelo'cI cut it (rep)
he cuts me (rep)
I slap him (rep)
he slaps me (rep)
I spread it (rep)
I spread them (rep)the reduplicated element has the same form in both even and odd
numbered positions.
7. The Simple Element in Final Position.
Simple elements in final position always have the reduced form
regardless of whether the position is even or odd in number. The
final form of the element differs from the reduced form in that the
consonant is not lengthened. By 'final position' is meant either
absolute or relative final: in most cases, theme elements can only
be relatively final since it is necessary to complete a form by means
of formal suffixes.

he-i -la-b -o'c
he-i -la-b hadjxo'cI lose (gambling)
I lose all
I stand
I stand up, ariseIn the above examples, the final elements happen also to be in even
numbered positions. If, however, the final element is in odd position,
the penult is even and should have the reduced form. But, because
of the rule acquiring the final element to be reduced no matter
what its position is with reference to the word, the penult re-inserts
its vowel — takes the full form. Thus:
no-d -x(a)-o'c
no-do-xI hoe it
hoeHere, -do- is in the second position but -xa, which has the third
position, is reduced because final, causing -do- to re-insert its vowel
and take the full form. Other examples:

Three kinds of simple elements, those with initial consonant h-,
y-, or '-, are elided completely under certain circumstances. Since
the factors governing such elision vary for the three element types
concerned, they must be considered separately.
h- as Initial Consonant.
Simple elements with h- as the initial consonant — unless in the
first position of the word or followed by certain theme affixes — are
absorbed to the vowel of the preceding element. Thus:
'e--da--we'c'e~-dah( a)-a'dono'c
nec-'e'-dah(a)- a'we'I come here
I will come here
he makes you come hereIn the first example, -ddha- has contracted to -da--; in the second
and third examples, the addition of the theme suffixes for the
future tense and second person pronoun object respectively has
caused a long vowel to follow -ha- whereupon it cannot contract
with the preceding element -da-. Note, in the last two examples,
that -ha-, being in the fourth position, should have the reduced

examples follow:

Simple elements with initial consonant y- usually follow the

completely elided.

There are only two examples of elements of this type in the even
numbered position. In these two cases, the element is completely
elided and the vowel of the preceding element is lengthened compensatively.
'e-g -o'cI give it t o h i mge'-g-o'he gives it to mewe'-g -o'cI g i v e it t o t h e mIn the above examples, the glottal stop of the reduced element
probably merges with, or drops out before, the following stop
consonant.
he-i -'a-djew-o'cyar-dj -o'cI watch itI see itThere is reason to believe that the two themes go back to the same
source, ya-dje- (* ya-'a-dje-) being the simple form, having elided
the second element completely. In the second example, the prefix
he- (and the suffix -wa) have been added, reducing the first element
of the theme and allowing the second to appear. Curiously enough,
however, the element ya~- of ya~dje- is no longer felt as ya'a- but
follows the elision pattern of a type CV~ element (cf. 11). Thus:
yam-dj -o'cge-ya -dj -o'I see himhe sees meB. COMPLEX ELEMENTS ( 913)9. General Remarks.

examples of them (cf. 5). They may be regrouped as follows:

the uncontracted, CVw, CVy, and the contracted, Co• in both
cases. Neither form is affected by the position of the element in the
word. The elements in the second column are those having a long
vowel in the full form (i. e., when the element is in the odd numbered position) and a short vowel in the reduced form. The elements
of the third column do not vary in form at all.

"C. SYLLABIFICATION AND ACCENT (19)19. Syllabification and Accent.
Each syllable of aTonkawa word must begin with a consonant
and, if possible, be composed of consonant plus vowel plus consonant. Where there is a series of sounds of the type CVGVG, the
first syllable will be CV, the second, GVC. Examples of syllabification:
ne-bax-gan
ne-bax-go'-ctobacco
I smokeyad-co'-c
gei-da-co'I stab him
he stabs meIf the vowel of a syllable be long, it need not be completed by a
consonant.
ya'-djo'-c
ge-ya-djo'I see him
he sees m eya'-be-djo'-cI make clothes22HOIJER TONKAWAIf, however, an element containing a long vowel be followed by a
consonant plus consonant, the first consonant must be included in
the first syllable. Thus :
ga'l-wo'-c
bcrb-no'-cI gamble
I set the tableGlottalized consonants are treated as are any others in the syllabification of a wordha-m'amc'e'-l'o'-co'-cI burn
I scratch itIn all of the preceding examples, it will be noted that a final
consonant may comprise a syllable.
Accent in Tonkawa is evenly distributed — each syllable receives
substantially the same accentuation. Occasionally, however, a
slightly heavier accent may be noted for the penult. Neither syllabification nor accent seem to have any effect upon the phonology of
the word nor are any morphological distinctions entirely dependent
upon them.","[31, 32]"
"The above is, of course, a case in which the theme may be used
without ya-. Others of this type will be discussed in section 49.
The following lists only those themes always appearing with the yacausative element.

nec- is the regular causative theme prefix and may be applied to
practically any verb theme (cf. 50). The themes listed below are
those which cannot be used without nec-. I t will be noted that, in
the reduplicated forms, the prefix nec- is repeated.

is, however, purely speculative: there is no means of proving it.

This analysis cannot be proved. Examples of t h e free use of da~a n d the details of its phonetic structure and t r e a t m e n t will be found
in section 48.
'ei- themes.
'ei- is not, properly speaking, a prefix b u t a theme which only
exists in compounds — which can no longer be used independently.
This is shown by its behavior when 'ei- themes are compounded
with others, viz:
'ei-dil'ay -o'c'ei-ge-dil'ay -o'da'an-dil'ay-o'cda'an-ge-diVay -o'I fall on him, hurting him; press him
with my bodyhe .. . meI squeeze him, hurting himhe . . . meNotice here t h a t 'ei- is dropped when the 'ei- theme (i.e., 'eidil'aye-)
is compounded with da'ane- t o pick, g r a s p . . . . Note, also, t h a t t h eHANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES47pronoun object ge- is inserted between 'ei- and -dil'aye- as it is
between da'an- and -dil'aye-. This treatment of the pronominal
prefixes is characteristic of compounds (cf. 36).
Whatever the origin of 'ei-, it is obvious that it now adds only a
transitive connotation to the theme it modifies. It is found with a
good many themes, but, in most cases, is removable (cf. 36). The
themes that follow cannot be used without it, except, of course,
when compounded with other themes.

"6HOIJER TONKAWAA. THE SIMPLE ELEMENT ( 6 — 8 )6. The Simple Element.
The simple element has been defined as consonant plus short
vowel. It has three forms depending upon its position in the word.
In the full form, it appears as CV, in the reduced form as Cm, and
when in the final position it takes the form C. It will be noted that,
in the reduced form, the consonant is lengthened compensatively
for the loss of the vowel. If the consonant happens to beTO,n, or I,
this lengthening gives it a syllabic quality. The final form of this
element will be discussed in detail in the following paragraph —
certain other changes occur which do not directly concern us here.
I stab himya-d'-c(a)-o'cya-, being in the first position, has the full form; -d'-, in the
second position, has been reduced from da; -c(a)-, in the third
position, should have the full form but, being followed by the
theme affix -o- merges with it to form -co- and the full form is
not evident. The word as it actually appears is, then, yadxo'c
'I stab him'.
ya-i -da-c -o'cI stab him repeatedlyHere, ya- is reduplicated and the repeated portion, in the
second position, is reduced: -da-, in the third position has the
full form; -c-, in the fourth position, is reduced from ca but
again merges with the following -o- affix to form -co-, obscuring
its actual form. The word: yaidaco'c. It is necessary to note
here that other theme suffixes besides -o- have certain effects
upon the final element of the theme obscuring its real form.
These will be discussed in sections 15 to 18.
ge-i -da-c -o'he stabs m eHere the theme affix ge- has been added, causing the first
element of the theme (but the second with reference to the
word) to have the reduced form (from ya) and the others to
take forms suitable to their positions in the word.
ge-ya-i-da-c-o'he stabs me repeatedlyHere, ge- is added as in the previous example but, since a
reduplicated element has the same form in both even and odd
positions, there is no change. Other examples:
ya-m-x(a)-o'cge-i -ma-x
ne-d-o'-1(e)-o'cge-n -da-l -o'
ya-l-b(a)-o'cwe-i -la-b -o'cI p a i n t his f a c e

or CVCV. The former is the one we should expect to find. I t is
possible that those elements reduplicating according to the latter
pattern (CVCV) are older complex elements of the type CV(which, in the reduplicated form, becomes CVCV; cf. 11) which
have lost all characteristics of that class except the reduplicated
form. Another explanation would ascribe such forms to analogy
with complex elements of the type CV'. No proof can be adduced
for either theory.

"Here we have a clear distinction between a neuter intransitive verb
and an active transitive verb. It may be well to remark, however,
that this is but an isolated example — no such verbal distinction
is generally recognized in theme forms. Nor is it possible, in this
particular case, to determine how much of this alternation has been
caused by the change from -ne to -e and how much is due to the
addition of ne-.The evidence with regard to -ne, -e alternations are
few but they do indicate that -ne is a characteristic of some — not
all — neuter verbs and that -e generally appears in an active theme.
The transitive signification is probably not due to ne- since it is used
with transitives and intransitives. The only conclusion is that necannot be defined from this set of forms.
ya-dicxene-dic'e-(e. g. a bull) butts . . .
to press, jab . . . (with finger)HANDBOOK O F AMERICAN INDIANLANGUAGES37In this case, too, we have an alternation of final theme elements
for which there is little definition possible (cf. 35). In view of this
fact, the ya-, ne- variation is not definable.
co"" yanaco'yadanenco'yawa-to swim off, away
to swim (towards the speaker)
to swim with a burden; to ferry . . .
across (e. g., to swim across holding a bundle of clothes out of the
water)In this case, two elements have been added, ne- and -n- and the
final elements of the themes are varied, -na and -da are clearly
definable as directives, the former referring to direction away from
the speaker, the latter to direction towards the speaker (cf. 34).
-wa appears to have a durative function — or, at least, appears in
a good many themes expressing repeated or long continued action
(cf. 45). -n- may be the reduced form of na- and ne- is evidently the
element we have been discussing. If na- is defined as an incorporated
object (cf. 28), ne- would appear to establish an oblique relationship between -co~yawa- and na-: thus, the complete analysis, newith, -n- an object, -ccryawa- to swim duratively.
The application of this analysis to other ne- themes requires, of
course, an analysis of the rest of the theme — a thing which is not
always possible. Thus: ne-gel-'e- could be analyzed: to do to . . . by
drowning — i. e., to d r o w n . . . — if we were sure that -e- could be
defined as an active transitive verbalizer — an element empty of
concrete significance but adding these more formal meanings to the
verb. This is not always possible (cf. 34).
Our conclusions with regard to the definition of ne-, then, must
be that its meaning cannot be deduced with accuracy without
knowing quite a bit about the rest of the theme. This knowledge
is not available for all themes: there are simply a few indications
as to their structure (cf. 39). But we can suggest that ne- has to do
with the relationship between theme elements — that ne- themes
are three element themes in which the second and third elements
are indirectly connected through ne-.
30. ya- Themes.
Themes having ya- as the first element are rather more numerous
than either of the two preceding groups, ya- is also a simple element
and has the reduplicated form yai-. This alone is unique; it will be
remembered that neither na- nor ne- were reduplicated. A number
of ya- themes repeat ya- in the reduplicated form; some repeat the
second element of the verb complex, and, for a few themes, both
types of reduplication are found. I t is not possible to place ya- with38HOIJER TONKAWArespect to ne- since they do not appear in the same themes. Nor are
there any test forms to show its relative position with respect

This section will be devoted to the presentation of a few isolated

Text examples: (there are, unfortunately, no text examples of the
future tense of this interrogative form).

In the singular form, the initial glottal stop of the tense suffix has

the dual and plural suffixes. Here, too, we find that the interrogative
suffix is dropped when the form is preceded by an interrogative
pronoun. There are only two text examples available:

have dropped the initial element of the assertive suffix preserving
the final -'a. It may be, therefore, that this initial element is the
assertive suffix and that -'a has to do with tense. There is still,
however, the problem of the pronoun suffixes — quite different in
this paradigm from what they were in the assertive. As before, we
find it best to consider this form apart from the assertive, even
though the resemblance is fairly close.
These forms are found rather frequently in the texts and here, too,
the final -' drops off when the form is preceded by an interrogative
pronoun.

"36. Theme Compounding.
Another factor affecting theme structure in Tonkawa may be
found in the process of composition. The language of today is very
fertile in compounds and it may well be that a number of themes
now felt as indivisible units are old compounds, the themes of
which have lost independent status. As a matter of fact, there are
examples of such formations but, before discussing them, it will be
necessary to examine the process of composition in general (only, of
course, as it applies to verb compounds: noun and other compounds
will be handled in section 85).
Verb plus verb is the predominant type of compound involving
verb themes. In fact, there are only three examples of other types:
hox-daxcew- morning dawns; to be morning, from hox early, before,
and daxcew- day breaks; hagoxa-adaJc-we- to be very tired, from
hagoxa- to be tired, hadak very, and -we- to be (hadak,
in all likelihood, may be compounded with other themes of a character

— the compounded theme means literally, then, ""to put away,
have the road"", i. e., ""to know the trail"" or ""to guide, scout"".
I n most compounds of verb plus verb, neither theme seems to
dominate or modify the other: both appear to retain their full
meanings.
Where this is not true, the first theme appears to be the dominant one, the second modifying. The following list will illustrate
the type.
yag-xailabato shoot (arrow) into the ground
yaq'e- to shoot (-'e- dropped in compounds); xaildba- to stick in the
ground (tr.)

yamga- to call . . . ; ha'da- one person comes
da'an-aidjonato pull . . . up
da'an- to grab, take . . . ; haidjona- to go upAn interesting feature of compounded themes is that the pronominal prefixes are placed between the two themes of the compound
(the normal position of the pronoun prefixes is the first position in
the verb; cf. 42).

nadj-geu-xicb -o'he (his sinews) are cut, broken
I bite him cutting a sinew
he . . . me
I . . . them
he . . . usThis would seem to indicate t h a t the compound is not quite felt as a
complete unity but, rather, as a combination of two independent
themes.
There are a number of locative themes most of which have no
independent usage but are found only in compound with either ha•one person goes (from ha-na- one person goes off) or da- two (or
more) persons go (from dana- two or more persons go off).","[65, 66]"
"59. The Interrogative Mode.
Any of the tense forms of the declarative mode may be made
interrogative by dropping the declarative -we and adding, after the
subject pronoun, a suffix -'. If, however, the form is preceded by an
interrogative pronoun, this final suffix is not necessary — the form
is obtained by simply dropping the declarative suffix. This is the
more common form of the interrogative found in the texts.",[99]
"63. The Suffix -e~l.
This is another of the irregular suffixes apparently defining a
mode which appears only in the third person singular, dual, and
plural. It may be also be used with the future tense suffix. The

exhortation or command concerning the third person. There are
no other forms even remotely related and these examples are
exhaustive.(b)The SubordinatingSuffixes(64—71)64. General Remarks.
There are six subordinating suffixes all of which are attached to
the theme subordinated. Three of them require the theme to be
conjugated as to person and number: the others are attached to an
absolute form of the theme.
65. The Suffix -ga'ak but, when, while, as

subject and object pronoun. The paradigm for the subordinated
verb is as follows:

"Note, in the third person plural, t h a t -n replaces -k. The -n so
substituted is probably cognate with the infinitive -n\ i. e., the
infinitive is used idiomatically in the third person plural.
-k forms may be used alone, with noun suffixes, or as bases for
the modal enclitics. The last named will be discussed in the section
following. The first two usages have a variety of functions, for
example:

"These examples show the usage of this form in direct discourse
when the question of tense or mode is not important. An expression
of fact about oneself: a desire, or announcement of intention, or a
suggestion.
The form may also be used with the future tense suffix -a-do-,
-a'dew- as follows:
hedjedo'n hcrn-a'do-nec I'll go back, hedjedjo'n back, here used adverbially
(cf. 87); ha'na- one person goes off. Note t h a t t h e person suffix is

I cannot account for t h e element -we. The context of this s t a t e m e n t :

illustrated in section 55.
(a) The Tense and Mode Suffixes(55—63)55. The Declarative Mode.
The suffix for the declarative mode is an element -we which may
also have the form -o under certain phonetic conditions (cf. 17).
It is always used with a tense suffix: the declarative mode may,
therefore, be subdivided into four tenses, the present, the past, the
near future, and the remote future.
6*84HOIJER TONKAWAI. The Present Tense.
The present tense suffix is -e and it directly follows the mode
suffix -we. The paradigm is as follows.

The full forms of both suffixes appear in the third person plural
with second person object. I n all but the two third person plural
forms, the tense suffix -e has the reduced form and in the second
person singular forms, it has been elided altogether causing the
vowel preceding it to be lengthened compensatively. Note t h a t the
declarative mode suffix has the contracted form -o except when
preceded by a long vowel (cf. 17).
This form defines a time between the immediate present and the
past: a line in time, as it were, as opposed to a point in time. For
this reason, it might just as well be termed the immediate past.
The following examples from the texts will bring out its meaning. 1

heigwidjan-ca-gen- a'lak 'eiganaxein-o'-c I lost my ring
The continuative suffix -no may be used with this tense. I t
defines an action t h a t is going on at the moment of speaking or a t
the moment of time referred to. I n some contexts, it defines habitual
or customary activity. Thus,
heigwidjan-lak da'gona-nec-n-o'-c we two are looking for a ring
""heilabau"" newe'-n-o'-c""stop!"" I was telling youxadaglan-abe-nec-n-o'they two are not getting off; are not
going to get off1A vocabulary of all the words used in these and the examples to follow
will be found in the Appendix.","[93, 94]"
"The peculiarities of this conjugation are unique. First, notice the
second person forms: evidently the suffix -gwa has combined with
an unknown suffix for the second person pronoun, but is is entirely
impossible to say where the division should be made. Note, also,
the irregular third person plural. I t is possible here t h a t we have the
full form of the suffix in -yagwa, the preceding -ya- pluralizing the
pronoun. If this is so, it must be assumed t h a t the -ya element of
the suffix has been totally elided in all the other forms of the verb,
leaving behind it only the compensatory lengthening of the vowels
of the elements preceding -gwa. And, finally, there is a striking
similarity between this paradigm — especially the third person form
— and t h a t discussed in section 57. I t is possible t h a t this has
substantially the same meaning as the -gwa mode save t h a t it
carries a subordinating connotation as well. Text examples follow:

This suffix is added to a constant theme, i. e., one not conjugated
for person and number. Person and number are expressed by the
principal verb for the two verbs. Text examples:
nex'eu-'a'lak nog-an 'eiwendjaganaklakno'o taking the gun, he killed them,
it is said
'awac-wa""-' a'la holgam'adjxe-dan-'an
hewawad xe'djneklakno'o the buffalo

'awac-'a'lak naul-'an yaxanoklakno'o cooking the meat, he ate it, it is said69. The Suffix -Vila while, when, as.
With this suffix, too, person and number are expressed by the
principal verb for the two verbs. This suffix may be used with the
future tense suffix but not with the continuative. I t serves to relate
two verbs defining actions t h a t take place simultaneously or
nearly so. Generally, it appears t h a t the action defined by the
principal verb results from t h a t of the subordinated verb •— but it
is clear t h a t both actions then continue together. Thus, in the
following example,
x'ax'ai'anoklakno'oweyadje-l'ilahe laughed when he looked at themthe context is as follows: a boy, seeing his uncles with shaven heads,
is moved to laughter and continues to laugh as he looks at them.
Examples:

798HOIJEB TONKAWA70. The Suffix -d.
This suffix is added to the constant theme and may be used
together with the future tense suffix or the continuative. I t
characterizes a verb whose action immediately precedes that of
the principal verb. In some cases — as in the first example below —
the two actions take place together: the combination, in the example
mentioned, is practically a compound verb, viz., hedjne-d
maga"" t o lie weeping"". An interesting proof of the validity of such
compounds is found in the following example:
ba'bna-d
ba'bna-dyaxa- to set the table to eat (yaxa- to eat)
yax-an table; that which is set for eatingwhere the combination is made a noun by the noun forming suffix
-an. That the suffix nominalizes the whole compound and not
only yaxa- is clear because the word yax-an also exists but has the
meaning ""food"". Examples:
hedjne-d, ma'ganoklakno'o
he lay crying, it is said
cocgona-d xadjloklakno'o
hearing it, she became angry, it is said
hewawa-d xe'djneklakno'o

with future tense or continuative. Examples:

There are two participial suffixes in Tonkawa, -n and -k. The
former has been referred to as an infinitive suffix since it is added to
the verb form not conjugated as to person and number. I t is used,
however, as a third person plural in the -k paradigms.
73. The -n Suffix.
Used alone, the -n forms can be translated in two ways — as an
infinitive, and as a hortatory — according to circumstances. I t is
also used in the third person plural of the -k paradigm: this usage
will be discussed in section 74. The suffix is added to the theme plus
pronoun object.
The infinitive use of the -n form is illustrated by the following:
hedlo'no'c yaxa-n I don't want to eathedlo'no'c xana-n I don't want to drinkhedlo'no'ga yagba-n you don't want to hit himhedlo'no'c yagba'-n I don't want to hit youhedlo'no' geigaba-n he doesn't want to hit mebabacan'e yela-n ""'crx-gak xanida Vc"" nonoklakno'o (after) sitting a while,

it is saidBy far the most common use of the -n suffix is to put the verb in
the hortatory mode. This form of the hortatory is only used for a
definitely plural subject: the other form of the hortatory will be
taken up in section 80.
da'daglana-no-n let's take him down

theme plus the continuative suffix -no.
1*100HOIJEK TONKAWACertain theme compounds are formed by putting the first theme
of the compound into the infinitive form. The secondary themes
used in these compounds have no independent existence. They are
listed below.
-xwo nearly, almost
yagban-xwo'c
yagban-xwono'c
geigaban-xwono'I nearly hit him
I am almost hitting him
he is almost hitting me-bil outside, another place
This theme is attached to the infinitive form of the verb it
modifies. I t is never used without either the suffix -na off, away, or
-da towards, hither, following. Examples:
yaxan-bilno'c
yaxan-bildo'c

"86. The Formal Suffixes of the Noun.
The noun may be followed by its adjective modifier, a demonstrative (or possessive) pronoun, or an auxiliary verb theme. In the
first two cases and when the noun is used alone, it must also be
followed by one or more formal suffixes. These suffixes define three
concepts: 1) the definite article (-'a- for the definite, zero for the
indefinite article); 2) singular and plural (-1 for the singular, -g for
the plural); and, 3) the relation of the noun to the verb whether
nominative, accusative, dative, or instrumental. There are also
certain suffixes denoting possession between two nouns and conjunction of two nouns. The suffixes align themselves as follows:
Indefinite
Singular
Plural
Nominative
Accusative
Dative
