"In the Ermenne narrative, we find various examples with participles in the
relative clauses. The following one shows the expected word order with the referent in front and the main verb in clause final position:

genitive. The referent, on the other hand, is marked as object according to its re-lationship to the subject of the relative clause, as opposed to its status in the main
clause.

a pronominal subject ir mug-os-a juu kab-o ‘did you leave, go, eat?’. The relative
clause is represented by a present indicative, udr-eedaag-a-te-rii, the other oneby a participle marked as object, okk-a-/fi-i-ka. The first one takes the position of
the object of the transitive verb mug- ‘leave’, the second one modifies the loca-tive noun phrase ‘diidee’.

"11.3.5 Relative ClausesSeveral ways to construct a relative clause are documented in Old Nobiin texts.
These different constructions deserve a thorough analysis which would go be-yond the scope of this study. Fortunately, some detailed preliminary investigation
has been done by Browne (1988) and Satzinger (1990) which serves as basis forthe short presentation and discussion of some Old Nobiin examples from religious as well as documentary texts. The presentation to a large extent follows
Satzinger’s categorization of the different types of relative constructions. Finally,corresponding examples from Modern Nobiin will be discussed.
In relative clauses, a participle, subjunctive or predicative can be found. Optionally, it may be introduced by the demonstrative pronoun in ‘this’. Satzinger
(1990:187) distinguishes three basic types which,
are (with formalized examples):
Il. nounitu+ noun-oB)few modifications included,+ participlesak-ka_pes-ilman
word
say-PARTPRES
‘the man who says the word’ = lit.: ‘the man saying the word’2. noun + noun-GEN + participle

‘the word, which the man said = lit.: ‘the word the saying of the man’2073. noun + subjunctive
salu
wordpes-in
say-3SGPRESSUB‘the word, he says’A prototypical type | relative clause is found in the following example from the
Nicene Canons:
(NC 29,11)
tillu.tak-kaau-ol-kagodhe-OB)make-PARTPRETI-OB) _ insult-PRED-EMPHair-a-lo‘(he) insults the god who made him’Although not morphologically marked as such ‘illu is the object of the clause and
therefore the participle is marked as object. The pronominal subject is not expressed.
A type 3 relative clause is documented in the following example from a documentary text. The referent is marked as object:
(IT 111 37, 15-16)
silim-inmaria-npakkatti-kapare-npakkatti-lopel-inIbrim-GENMary-GENshare-OB)land-GENshare-income-out-3SGPRESSUB“the share of the Mary (church) of Ibrim which consists of a share of land’The first example from the Mena legend is a complex sentence consisting of an
interrogative, a relative and a purpose clause. Furthermore, it is a direct speech
statement:

us‘father, don’t you remember this which a woman gave to us in order that we might (it) give to the
church of St. Mena’The first part of this sentence is a variant of type 2 above. The first noun is replaced by an interrogative clause the object of which serves as referent for the
relative clause. The relative clause is markedas participle and the precedingnoun is in the genitive. The object of the main clause in-ka ‘this’ is also the object of the relative clause. Again, the verb in the relative clause is nominalized,
and therefore the subject of the relative clause ittu uen- is marked as genitive.","[207, 208]"
"Another formation of purpose clauses is also based on the endings of the conditional (see chapter 7) to which once more the complementizer -a is added. Asis the case for the conditional a complete paradigm can be put together for the
purposive consisting of

‘and the father said to the boy: “O in truth, cooking bring it to me, in order that I may eat”The example shows that the construction could be used, if the subject of the
purpose clause was not identical to the subject of the main clause. As for the
conditional, there is also a variant with -ka which is documented in one of the
Qasr Ibrim texts:
(IT III 30.26-27)

nation’
;194Corresponding to the conditional, a form -koa(lo)
marked is also documented.in which the personis notFinally, in a third construction the imperative in connection with the verb il‘to say’ and complementizer -a can serve to express a purpose clause (see alsoExcurse 2 where additional examples are given), as in:
(Lec. 112.10)ted-in
they-GENtauo
da-l-gu-ka
under be-PART-PL-OBJjanos-ij-e-s-a
redcem-PL-IMPER-EMPH-COMP‘in order that he might redeem those who are under the law’Looking at Modern Nobiin, the question arises what happened to these different
formations of purposes clauses. Although the conditional construction based on-ka has been preserved the conditional-based paradigm for the purposive presented above seems to have completely disappeared. Corresponding to Old Nobiin is a formation with an element -eenii which still has the variants -oonii and
-aani. Contrary, however, to the construction in Old Nobiin, the suffix is attachedto the tense/aspect/person marker of the verb, as in the following examples from
the Ermenne narrative and the Gospel of St. Mark:
(Erm. 103)ai
|fa-kir-a
IFUT-come-ADJikka
you-OBJirii
you_firge-k-ka
wish-PARTPRES-OBJfa-aaw-a-tee-r-een
IFUT-d0-ADJ-BEN-1SGPRES-PURP‘I will come, in order that I do for you what you want’In this example, the suffixing of the purpose marker to the tense/aspect/person
suffix is one indicator for a construction which basically differs from the one inOld Nobiin. Main clause and purpose clause are related as a verbal complex with
the main verb marked as adjunctive and only the verb in the purpose clause tak-ing the tense/aspect/person suffix. The purpose clause includes a pronominal
object and an additional object clause consisting of the present participle with thesuffix -ka.
This construction can also be used if the subjects of main and purpose clause
differ, as in
(GM1,17)abaag annaa kaj-j-an

|fa
FUTukkaa
you-PL-OB)ademi-ri-in
man-PL-GENSaiaada-kaj-j-ir-eenifisherman-CAUS-PL-1 SGPRES-PURP
‘follow me so that | will make you fishers of men’195Because of the different subjects, the two verbs cannot be constructed as verbalcomplex but have to take separate tense/aspect/number markers.
In the last example, we also find separate markers in the clauses presumably
due to the imperative in the main clause:
(GM 6,31)
tann-ana-ion
gO-IMPERPL-he saidfalee
desertwee-lakidekka_tiig-all-ooni
one-toalittle
sit-FUT-PURP“go”, he said, “to a desert in order to stay a little”In all three examples, the verb is marked as future/intentional, the old as well as
the innovated formation are used. In the last sentence from the gospel, the imper-sonal purpose clause has the future infinitive and is not marked for person.
Werner (1987:166ff.) seems to be confused with regard to the correct segmentation of the suffixes when he categorizes the purposive (“Begriindungs- oderFinalform”) as present tense paradigm. He presents the following ending:
IsG-leeni/-reeniIPL-looni/-rooni2sG
3sG-nameeni
-naani2PL
3PL-lokomeetii
-innanaaniThese actually are the present tense suffixes to which the endings discussed
above were added. As Werner has no examples in his sentences but only the
paradigm he collected, it can only be assumed that in a context, the innovated
future prefix would have been required.","[194, 195, 196]"
"Although the subjunctive is expected in the subordinate clause the indicative
is found in the next sentence. There are several other examples for the use of theindicative in complement/subordinate clauses in the documentary texts which
could indicate the beginning of the loss of subjunctive forms.

until‘and the skipper taking (and) receiving the egg, placing (it) within the hold, set (it) amongst the otherfood, until he came to Philoxenite’As the subject of the main clause is the same as that of the subordinate clause,
the participle is used with -pauka. The use of the object marker suggests that-pau is a noun by origin. There is only one possible candidate in the Old Nobiin
dictionary pau(u) ‘power, authority, order’. The object marker -ka is often used
in temporal expressions to denote duration (see chapter 3.2.3).",[203]
"In most instances, an additional purpose marker ken ‘in order to, so that’ is
found which either introduces the purpose clause or is prefixed to the verb, as in

196prefixed purposive marker. The verb kan-/ken-/kin- ‘to be, become’ is not documented in contexts which indicates the beginning of a development towards a
purposive marker. The same applies for the verb ken- ‘to place’ which is documented as first verb in verbal complexes in Old Nobiin. To interpret some of
these constructions as purpose clauses would be more fantasy than plausibility.
Thus, it has to be concluded that the origin of -ken- remains a mystery and that
Old Nobiin gives no hint towards its unraveling. This is all the more unfortunateas in the modern language, ken can replace all other markers of a purpose clause
and serve as the only indicator for this type of a clause. Examples are:

future/intentional infinitive and suffix -ea which, as has been described before,
consists of infinitive -e and reduced -a (see Excurse 2). An example is:(GM 16.1)

As for the sequence of tenses in ‘open’ conditional clauses, the texts presentthe following combinations:1.",[190]

either the predicative or more probably the complementizer -a also used in various other constructions and described in Excurse 2. The literal meaning of pur-Pose clauses constructed in this way would be ‘saying, if...’. The variations are
presumably due to assimilation processes depending on the vocalization of the
preceding verb. The following examples are from the Miracle of St. Menas:

The main clause consists of a
verbal complex ked-a ki-sna ‘he ascends comes’ marked as 3"" person singular
preterit II indicative and is followed by the purpose clause.
The next example from the Menas legend is rather interesting in its complex

The final example from St. Menas is introduced by a temporal clause marked
by -/okono ‘after’ which follows the preterit II participle (see below). The main

-ko and in the past tense. These few sentences are insufficient to find any regularity. They indicate, however, that a process where the verb ‘to have’ was used as
an aspect marker had presumably started not later than the 12‘ century in spokenNobiin and was occasionally used by individuals in informal written communication. Until the end of the documentation of Old Nobiin, it was, however, rarelyused. Although nothing definitive can be deduced, the few examples point to kon/ kun-/ko- marking a ‘classical’ perfect aspect: It is the verb ‘to have’ that can be
used with different tenses and as far as the contexts are undisputable a state resulting from an earlier event is expressed in each sentence.",[173]

In all types described above, we find either the participle or the subjunctive in
the relative clause. There are, however, additional constructions which employ
the predicative or even the indicative in the relative clause. This becomes neces-sary if the referent is also marked as predicative. The following variants can be

functioning as a copula. As suffix -a is sufficient to mark a predicate, -/o can also
be interpreted as emphatic particle or focus marker. au-sa- is a predicative theending of which goes back to a preterit II participle -si/- plus predicative -a-. The
verb in the modifying clause is nominalized, and because of this its subject mina-na is marked for genitive case. The sentence is an example of a restrictive relative clause where the relative or modifying clause restricts the referent, in this
case the ‘miracle’, to a specific member of that class, in this case ‘which Menadid’. Browne (1994:22) classifies this type of construction as “attributive relative
clause”. The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘(it) is a miracle the holy martyr of
Christ Mena’s having done’.","[208, 209, 210]"
"8.3 Plurality (Subject/Object/Action)

genitive. Similar constructions have been observed by Abel (193 1:27ff.). In theseinstances, the verb seems to be interpreted as a nominalized verbal form.
An exception to the otherwise more or less strict sequence of tenses/aspects in
conditionals is found in the next example from the Ermenne narrative:

and the implicit meaning is ‘every time I do something so that he dies...’.
Examples for remote or counterfactual conditionals are rare in the texts. As
has been mentioned before these constructions serve as irrealis in Old Nobiin.
Marker of the irrrealis is the suffix -en the origin of which is far from clear. I*
might be related to in- ‘to be’, the most convincing explanation so far.

suffix in the example above. In the consequent, the verb is marked as future
preterit.
Browne (2002:89) compares -en to a form described as ‘electivum’ by Lepsius(1880:113-114). According to Lepsius, this suffix is used in the preterit and
conveys the meaning of ‘I could have done it (if I had wanted to)’ which seems
to imply an irrealis. One example from the gospel is191(GM 14.5)

type of construction in the texts. Contrary to the order of elements in Oid Nobiin,
-een here precedes the tense/aspect/person markers in Modern Nobiin.","[191, 192]"
"13.12 Letter-writing
The documents most difficult to understand and interpret are the letters from
Qasr Ibrim. This is partly due to their fragmentary condition, partly due to the
informal character of the language used which often seems to reflect spoken
language. This is exciting for a linguist who gets a glimpse of a linguistic variation which otherwise mostly remains unknown but frustrating for anyone concentrating on content. Because only one side of the correspondence is preserved,
understanding is additionally impeded. More often than not the question arises
what the writer wanted to communicate to the addressee.
The letters fall into different categories, depending on their being more or less
official in character. The most difficult to understand is the personal correspondence. Rather official are the letter to and from the eparchs which often refer to
disbursement of grain. Grain seems to have been stored either in central storage
facilities or in places belonging to the eparch.”¢ In spite of the official character
of these letters, they also show a personal touch which breathes life into the medieval texts. Even though problems with economical transactions are addressed,
personal remarks reveal actual human beings speaking to us. “Come, in order
that I may show you affection. What is it? The king has ordered you. Why are
you reluctant to approach the task?”, an unidentified eparch writes to a mancalled Maffuda. Another letter seems to have been dictated or written by a possibly angry Eparch Adam (IT III 51). It reads unintentionally comical when Adam
writes: “Being reluctant to give (them) to her (agent) who was about to come, I
took the dates and gulped them down.”
Amongst the letters preserved we also find documents originating from the
ecclesiastical administration as well as priestly correspondence. Concerning the
latter, Adams (1996:229) wonders about the reason why they were actually archived because “they do not appear to deal with matters of great consequence”.
This, however, we are not in the position to decide in retrospective. And if we
look at modern administrative practices of preserving every snippet of paper atleast for a certain period of time there is no reason to assume that the medieval

"11.2 The Main Clause
In Old Nobiin, main clauses have as their predicate a verb marked as predicative
or indicative. As has been described before, the indicative emerges when predicative -a is suffixed to the subjunctive, whereas the predicative emerges when -ais attached to the participle. Corresponding to these two forms found in complement or subordinate clauses, the indicative is also marked for person and number
as is the subjunctive whereas the predicative is not. In the following, main
'7 “Abneigung gegen Satzverzweigung durch Relativpronomina und Konjunktionen” (ibid.)183clauses in the indicative and predicative with various tense/aspect markers are
given. For each tense/aspect form, examples from the more formal religious aswell as the documentary texts are presented:

with the second verb marked as participle.

texts, the combination of overt expression of the subject and indicative is more
often found because of stylistic reasons.","[183, 184, 185, 186]"

marked as object. In the main clause, the predicative is used because the subject
is known and therefore mustn’t be marked at the main verb.
A similar but slightly different construction is found in the next example from
the miracle of Menas.",[210]
"2.5.1 The TextsThis study is based on Old and Modem Nobiin texts published by various authors. As the corpus of Old Nobiin is restricted, all texts were included except
small fragments and texts where only smaller parts were well preserved. Old
Nobiin textual material extends over a period of seven hundred years. Most of
the texts cannot be dated accurately; paleographic studies which aim at a chronological classification of the material are still missing. There is some evidence that
most of the documents originate in the tenth to twelfth centuries. The oldest
manuscript preserved so far dates back to 797 (Lajtar 1997:117); the youngest
one bears the date 1484 (Adams 1977:533). Half of the documents preserved
cover religious texts, as e. g. translations of the New and Old Testament, homilies
and other Christian writings. The other half comprises documentary texts such as
contracts and letters. In the latter category are 32 manuscripts which were foundin one vessel at Qasr Ibrim and could be identified as part of 12th century archive
on the basis of date specifications at the beginning of the texts. Most of the
documents originate in Lower Nubia where Nobiin is still spoken today. This hasnothing to do with a geographically uneven distribution of writing in Nubia, but
with the northern part being much better excavated than the south.
The two main textual categories differ in several ways. The religious texts are
often works of translation from Greek Vorlagen and because of the specific context represent a rather conservative Nobiin. By far the longest religious text is the24so-called Serra East codex which was published by Browne under the name of its
Greek Vorlage Ps. Chrisostom. /n venerabilem crucem sermo (Browne 1984).
The documentary texts, and within this groups one has to mention specifically
the letters, show a more modern language which sometimes even gives the impression of a “spoken” variety. Many concern economic transactions including
sales of land and orders for payment. We find documentation of emancipation of
slaves and the personal correspondence between dignitaries of the Nubian
church.!°
The entire corpus of Old Nobiin has the size of about one hundred pages of
continuous text.'!' The problems brought about by a corpus which is limited in
content and form are understood but not further discussed here. Nevertheless, it
is more than adequate to serve as the basis for a historical grammar. Hopefully,
more textual material will be found in the future which will allow us to complete
our knowledge of the language. For a survey of the textual editions, I refer to the
list of abbreviations and the bibliography.
The documents mentioned above were used in their published and annotated
form. 1 mainly worked with the numerous publications by the late Gerald M.
Browne whom we owe most of the first or revised editions of the Old Nobiin
texts. His “Old Nubian dictionary” (1996) and his very compact “Old Nubian
grammar” (2002) have been extremely helpful for me. Griffith’s first editions of
different Old Nobiin texts (1913) and the first comprehensive grammar by Zyhlarz (1928) were also consulted.
Because Nobiin definitely ceased to function as written language by the end
of the 15th century we have a large gap in our direct knowledge of the processesof language change which extends over a period of four hundred years. A few
words and phrases were recorded by the Franciscan Arcangelo Carradori in 1635
in Egypt; the material is interesting but restricted and doesn’t help to reconstruct
language change.
The modern written documentation of Nobiin starts with the European scholars Leo Reinisch and Richard Lepsius in 1879 and 1880. The latter undertook his
field researchin Nubiain the1840s, so that what we call ModernNubianstartsin the middle of the nineteenth century. This classification is arbitrary because it
depends on the presence of linguists in Egypt and the Sudan and not on linguistic
criteria. The longest text published by Lepsius is a translation of the gospel according to Mark from Arabic into Nobiin. This he complemented by several
Nobiin songs he recorded when he traveled in the region. In the foreword to his
'0 The different subjects of the documentary texts are discussed in chapter 13.

"There too, an underlying indirect or oblique object is realized as a surface direct
object and the verb bears a distinctive inflection expressing the semantic relationof the surface direct object. Although this is found in many examples in Old
Nobiin, in other instances the oblique object is expressed as such on the surface >143but nevertheless marked at the verb. As can also be observed in Old Nobiin, the
indirect or oblique objects need not to be explicit, i. e. expressed on the surfaceat all. Semantically, the complex often expresses that the action is happening for
a beneficiary, i. e. they function as benefactive. These functions of the verb ‘togive’ are found in many languages of the world. Some examples from Old Nobiin texts are:

"2.3 Linguistic Variation within the Texts
Although Old Nobiin is undoubtedly an earlier variant of Modern Nobiin, it was
not in the strictest sense a standardized language. A close look at the text revealssome variations which shed light on the linguistic background of the scribes.
These variations are to be expected as the region was linguistically heterogeneous and it would oversimplify the situation to assume that all scribes were mother tongue speakers of Old Nobiin. In addition to that it goes without saying that20See Chapter 2.6.
See for example Keller 1992.int as ET,8

linguistic variation. It concerns the sale of land owned by a woman named Kapopi to another woman named Neuesi. With regard to content, it is fascinatingbecause it gives information about the position of women in Nubia at the end of
the 12th century (see chapter 13.8). Linguistically, it is interesting because it
contains numerous place names (see chapter 13.10) and most notably words not
found elsewhere. One of these is ana-biti (36 ii 3), presumably a beverage. It is
found as ana-piti in IT 34 1 29, and the second element -piti presumably corre-sponds to -pitti in ChN. 5.11 and St. 22.5 where it is also found in a compound
denoting a beverage. The phoneme 6 of ana-biti is not part of the original inventory of Nobiin and is also not found as allophonic variant of p. The modern correspondence of Old Nobiin p is f so that it is not evidence of regular sound
change. -biti actually represents the expected Dongolese/Kenzi form because Old
Nobiin p, Nobiin f regularly correspond to Dongolese/Kenzi 5 and vice versa.
Although a scribal error cannot be excluded, the writing variant can also indicatea different linguistic background. The latter assumption is supported by another
lexeme found in IT III 36, kal- ‘to eat’. The verb ‘to eat’ is one of the few lexemes diagnostic for classifying a wordlist as Nobiin or Dongolese/Kenzi by
origin. kal- is the Dongolese/Kenzi word shared by most of the other Nubian
languages whereas Old and Modern Nobiin have the isolated word kap-/kab-.
IT III 36 is the only instance where kal- is documented in writing but in the same
text, also kap- is found.","[20, 21]"
"The development of Greek as a lingua franca is closely related to the introduction of Christianity which started in the Sth century AD. At the same time, Greek
became one of the written languages of “international” or diplomatic communi-cation between peoples of different linguistic background. A letter written by a
king of the Blemmyes (Beja) to a Nubian king dated to the 5th century is evidence of this development (Skeat 1977; Plumley 1982). Relating to the language
of this letter, Hagg (1982:105) speaks of “Pidgin Greek, in the strict sense of the
term, that is, a means of communication between two parties, neither of whom
used Greek as his native tongue, and with the grammatical structure partly broken down”. Numerous inscriptions and graffiti show a Nubian-Greek bilingual-ism which exhibits some sort of “mixture” of the two languages. Jakobielski
(1972:14) speaks of “mixed texts [...] which—with fundamentally Old Nubian
structure—preserve some Greek words together with articles or Greek texts with
numerous orthographical and grammatical errors”.",[17]
"6.3 Old Future/Intentional/Irrealis
Zyhlarz was the first to describe in detail what he called the Old Nubian FutureTense. His presentation showed some discrepancies and was in need of clarification. This clarification came from Hintze (1977) who tried to organize the different endings of the future and to make a new attempt at interpreting the alternativeforms. He, however, kept Zyhlarz’ original classification into future I and future II which he arranged into three levels respectively, the meaning of which hewas unable to determine on the basis of the data at his disposal. He assumed that
the different levels express different aspects or Aktionsarten.
Browne (1982:12) objected to Hintze’s complicated classification and explained that the two suffixes of the future, -d- and -ad-/-ar, which are present inOld Nobiin, are allomorphs rather than two different types of future. The form
with -d- follows vowels, n-, /- or r-, -ad-/-ar follow a consonant or double nn-, /lor rr-. The suffixes of the so-called future tense consist of the allomorphic futureparticiples -aril-/-dil, -del + personal endings. The paradigms are the following:

-di/eranThis form which has traditionally been called future tense by the different authors actually fulfils a variety of functions, as can be shown with examples from
different texts.
Temporal expressions with future meaning are uncommon in Old Nobiin
texts. Sometimes, however, e//e ‘time’ is used which in these cases seems tofunction as an adverb with meaning ‘in the future’ (Browne 2002:77):
(ChN 5.16-17)

you-PL-OBJ‘that which I shall set before you today’84uskr-a

time at which the event is going to happen. The event is going to happen on thesame day but sometimes later. The point of reference here is the moment of
speaking.
Corresponding to the religious content of many of the texts the so-called fu-ture is often present in prophecies or annunciations. The first example belongs to
the gospel according to St. Matthew where an angel appears to Joseph in a dream
and announces the birth of Jesus:

miclir-iapad-dina-lofault(?)you-income forth-3SGOFUTIND-EMPH‘The fault (?) in you will come forth’As in many languages of the world the old future of Nobiin is often found in
contexts where intention is expressed which leads over to the domain of mode
and modality, e. g.
(M. 4.15)
toukr-en
leave-PARTisgil
wherejo-din
go-2SGOFUTSUB“When you leave, where will you go?’Many examples in this category contain conditional clauses, e. g.

"303. The Noun3.1 Number
Old Nobiin has a common nominal plural marker -gu. Much less common are
the two markers -ri-gu and -ni-gu. Zyhlarz’ (1928:36) attempt to divide these two
along the categories animated (-ri-gu) vs. inanimate (-ni-gu) has to be rejected.
Browne (2002:31) associated -ri-gu with loan words from Greek, but only as an
optional variant, and his first example mug-ri-gu ‘dogs’ can not be regarded as a
Greek loan at all. As -ri- as well as -ni- precede the basic plural marker -gu we
can assume that an original distinction which complemented -gu lost its function
and meaning. In all cases, -gu may be deleted. The plural markers precede the
case markers (see below).
In Modern Nobiin, nominal plural marking is more complex due to loans from
the related Nubian languages Dongolese/Kenzi (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996). The
language has four plural markers two of which are absent in Old Nobiin texts.
The Old Nobiin basic plural morphemes -gu as well as the less common -ri (with
-gu always absent) are preserved, -ni-gu is lost. According to Werner (1987:80),
-gu and -ri are marked by high tone. Two low tone suffixes -ii and -ncii are modern loans. In Dongolese, -i is suffixed to a noun with a terminal consonant, -nci
to a terminal vowel (Armbruster 1960:159). In Nobiin, the use of the borrowed
plural suffixes is not restricted to loanwords from Dongolese. Which of the four
plural markers of Modern Nobiin is used with a certain noun is not predictable
and seems to be optional. Lepsius (1880:32) tried to find some regularity and
related -nci to nouns with a final long vowel and accent on the last syllable if
disyllabic. According to Werner (1987:81), words ending in high tone -ée take
plural -ncii in most cases.
If we take the example of -gi(i) ‘uncle, mother’s brother’, it takes plural suffix
-ncii according to Lepsius (1880:32). In Abel’s Ermenne text which has numerous examples for ‘uncle’, gi- has plural marker -gw suffixed in all instances.
Khalil in his Nobiin dictionary (1996:26) gives both suffixes as optional alternatives. All things considered it can be concluded that Nobiin and Dongolese Nubian language contact added to the Nobiin system of plural marking and made it

because—amongst other things—they specify an indirect object in a verbal complex. Still, tir-/den- as second element are used in a verbal complex after the
adjunctive -a which is, however, often missing. The following paradigm showsthe modern endings which are contracted from -tir- plus present tense personal

Old Nobiin:

Instead, the second object, a benefactive, is marked by fir-.

In the texts, it can be observed that some of the verbs, most notably iig- ‘to
say’, are hardly ever used without tir-/den-. Examples are:

not realized, as in the first.
In addition to iig- ‘to say’ Lepsius (1880:139) lists a few other verbs which
mostly take tir-/den-. These verbs are: wiidkire- ‘to answer’, gafre ‘to forgive’,arre ‘to bring’, nadiife ‘to clean’, faai- ‘to write, prescribe’, iidir- ‘to send’, aaw‘to do’, and fedd- ‘to beg’. His examples come from the gospel of St. Mark, such as:With Surface Direct Object

Nobiin as independent verbs with the meaning ‘to give someone (2""4/3""d person)’
and ‘to give to me/us (1st person)’. The verbs are found in verbal complexes
following the adjunctive -a which was occasionally missing at the older stageand is more often omitted in present-day Nobiin. It did function and still functions as an applicative. Underlying indirect or oblique object are marked by fir-/
den- regardless of whether they are realized as surface directs objects, surface
oblique objects or not realized on the surface at all. This construction can be
regarded as rather unchanged in the process of languages development from the
Medieval period to the present.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"More often, we find relative clauses with participles, as in the next two examples from the gospel of St. Mark:

main verb is clause initial in both instances. Also in both sentences, the main
verb is followed by a postpositional phrase into which the relative clause is embedded. The postposition is clause final. Only in the first example, however, the
participle is marked as object.",[212]
"Browne (ibid.) hypothesizes that -a is a reduced form of ia- ‘saying’ which con-sists of the verb -i plus adjunctive -a.
-a does not only function as marker of direct speech, but also as complemen-tizer in Old Nobiin. That Browne’s hypothesis on the origin of -a is correct, is
shown below, where the non-reduced and the reduced forms are found as complementizers in similar contexts. In these examples they are used with the verb
ank- ‘to think’:

was described as second stage of the grammaticalization process above. The next
examples show the marker of direct speech/complementizer as marker of reason/
purpose clauses:(Lec. 109.1)

‘I do not ask that you take them’95This sentence from the Lectionary is interesting in that -a and conjunction -ion
follow the imperative, resulting in a complex suffix -eaion. The connection with
the imperative as well as with the verb ik- (ek-) ‘to say’ is found in the followingexamples from the documentary Qasr Ibrim text:
(IT II] 48.7-8)

clauses are expressed by the infinitive and the verb i- + adjunctive -a. The resulting compound suffix -ia is often reduced to -a which functions as marker of
direct speech.
Wanting to summarize what has been discussed above we have to turn to thedifferent forms as well as to the various functions and the possible relationship of
the two.
In Old Nobiin, a verb il- ‘to say’ is found which is often reduced to i-. It hasvarious forms and functions depending on the contexts and the following endings. The forms and function can be listed as follows:
96FormFunctioni(l)i- + -a adjunctive reduced to -a-reinforces another verb of speaking
marker of direct speechi- + -a adjunctive or reduced -a
imperative + -ia or reduced -acomplementizer
purpose clauseThe combination of the various additional endings needed to express the different functions produces a wide range of compound suffixes, as e. g.
reduced -a-ai- + -a adjunctive
-ia + -ion conjunction ‘and’-ia
-iaionimperative -e + reduced -aimperative -e + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a“a-esoa, -esaimperative -e + reduced -a + -ion conjunction-eaionimperative -ana + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a-anasoSome of these endings are obviously related to those listed by Lepsius (1880) for
Modern Nobiin under the different headings “imperative”, “conjunctions” and
“purpose clause”. On the way from Old to Modern Nobiin the imperative/jussivedropped optional emphatic -so. Imperative markers -e and -ana are still present
from Old Nobiin. To these Lepsius (1880:139ff.) adds other endings which are
now well known from Old Nobiin. If we isolate these endings, we find:
SG-ee the long vowel presumably going back to imperative -e + -a
-ia(a)PL“a
-ia(a)According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) for the 3"" person jussive occasionally -ion
for the singular and plural is added to the 24 person endings, resulting in suffixes
38G
3PL-eion
-anaionWhat we find here are not new endings for the imperative but the markers of
direct speech/complementizer of Old Nobiin. Either Lepsius misinterpreted these
endings due to the fact that all his examples for imperatives necessarily consistedof either direct speech or complement clauses/indirect speech or we are dealing
with a reanalysis of Old Nobiin purpose clause as simple imperatives.
Lepsius and Abel note that in the texts the different forms of the ending inter-change arbitrarily. These variations consist of:
Form
Lepsius
Abel-ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion
-eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiyeWemer= -aya/-yon/-ayon/-eyon97The endings given by Lepsius and Werner are similar, because they both includeat least some forms which add -ion/-yon. Werner (1987:342) lists -aya as nonpersonal form meaning ‘saying’. The three other suffixes are translated as ‘he
said’, thus being interpreted by him as 3'4 person singular preterit which, how-ever, has lost final -n according to his own paradigm. From the many examples
in the texts it seems much more probable that these endings go back to Old Nobiin forms with conjunction -ion ‘and’ (see above).","[95, 96, 97, 98]"
"In the context of lists containing titles of officials preserved in Qasr Ibrim, the
Eparch is only one amongst many and not set apart from the others. Adams tries
to explain the relationship between the Eparch of Nobatia and the king of Dotawo in the following way: “The best suggestion is probably that the king and the230eparch held dominion over clearly distinct spheres of activity, the king being the
main source of civil and legal authority while the eparch was responsible for
trade and for relations with Muslims in general.” Taking a closer look at the lists,
it becomes evident that king and eparch are far from being on the same hierarchical level. The most detailed ones consist of two parts. The first part is headedby the king of Dotawo, the king’s mother and some high officials close to the
king. The second part begins with the words “and in Nobadia [...]” followed by
the title and name of the Eparch and other dignitaries belonging to the region
(Browne 1991). One sales contract explicitly describes the position of the Eparch: “[...] and in Nobadia all authority being attached to him“ (ibid., 42). In this
context, Nobatia turns out to be subordinate to Dotawo rather than existing side
by side.
The texts furthermore reveal that more than one eparch was operating in Nubia. Other officials with this title are associated with Lower Nubia and Palagi. In
a royal proclamation (IT III 30), king Moses George of Dotawo also held the
office of the Eparch of Palagi. The existence of several eparchal offices also
contradicts the notion of some kind of “deal” which was negotiated at the alleged
unification of the Nubian kingdoms.
Again, it seems interesting to look at what the different sources tell about the
eparch and his function. Starting with the title itself, the Greek eparchos is found
in some of the Old Nobiin sources, but much more often the Nobiin equivalent
soyoj is found. Both designations do not appear in Arabic documents. Instead,
the title “Lord of the Mountain” or “Lord of the Horses”, with both readings
possible in unpointed texts, are found. As the reading “Lord of the Mountain” is
supported by some pointed Arabic texts, Browne (e. g. 1991:xi) interpreted the
Nobiin title as consisting of yoj(j) ‘mountain’ and archaic or dialectal variant of
sa(e)- ‘governor’. This etymology is, however, far from being convincing. Sa(e)seems to be only documented once (ChN 4.8) and then in a context where itrefers to the captain of a ship. Furthermore, we would expect a different order of
the parts of the compound, because in Nobiin, the genitive usually precedes its
noun. It seems just as possible that the second element is related to Old Nobiin
yod- ‘Lord’.
Adams (1996:245) reports that among the Qasr Ibrim texts, some letters writ-ten in pointed Arabic and addressed to the Eparch were found in which the reading “Lord of the Horses” or even “Lord of the King’s Horses” is equally undisputable. This matches the late Gerald Browne’s find that the Arabic “Lord of the
Horses” is a direct rendering of Old Nobiin mourt-in nod-il ‘horse-GEN lordSUBJ’ which is documented in a text (cited as pers. comm. in Adams 1996:245).
We can conclude that in the case of the office of eparch, the Arab sources cor-rectly translate at least one of his titles. Whether Nobiin soyoj corresponds to
231Arabic “Lord of the Mountain” remains dubious, as does the connection between
the two titles and the functions of the soyoj. In a letter of Eparch Masi (IT II 24),
the author writes that he was out in charge of the horses of his addressee. Thismight indicate that the eparch was responsible for the welfare of horses but he
could just as well have been talking about a personal arrangement.","[230, 231, 232]"
"In the Old Nobiin texts from Qasr Ibrim, the eparch presents himself primarily
through his correspondence. One of his duties was the disbursement of grain
mentioned in most of the eparchal letters in Old Nobiin. More information on the
functions of the eparch is found in the Arabic manuscripts which, unfortunately,
are not published yet. Preliminary reports about the content of some of these
manuscripts show that the eparch organized the trade with Muslim Egypt and
had also some diplomatic responsibilities (Plumley 1975:106). This for once
corresponds to what Arab sources tell about the eparch. His office looms large inthese texts which is not surprising given that he presumably was the most important official the Muslim traders had to deal with. Detailed information on the“Lord of the Mountain” is found in al-Magrizis renarration of al-Aswani’s account (Vantini 1975:602ff.). He is described as representative of the Nubian king
and any Moslem who wanted to trade in Nubia had to deal with him. Accordingto al-Aswani/al-Maqrizi, one of his responsibilities is to prevent any trader or
traveler to proceed further upstream to Dongola without a travel permit. As the
‘Lord of the Mountain’ was responsible for the relationship with Egyptian Muslims, he might also have been the official to take care of the bagt-treaty whichregulated the provision of slaves to Egypt in exchange for manufactured goods
and which also guaranteed freedom to travel and settle in northern Nubia to Muslims from Egypt and elsewhere. This, however, can only be indirectly deduced
and is not actually documented in the written sources (comp. Adams1996:245ff.).
For the obvious reasons indicated above the Arab sources seem to be only interested in the Eparch of Nobadia. But even the sources from Nubia itself do not
reveal how, aside from dealing with the Moslem north, his duties differ fromthose of the eparchs of Lower Nobadia and Palagi. One order from Tamsi, Eparch of Lower Nobadia (IT III 46), also concerns the disposal of grain. It would,
however, over-interpret the scant evidence to assume that the office of the eparch
was always connected with central grain storing facilities.",[232]
"1108. “Old” Verbal ExtensionsThe verbal extensions discussed below are called “‘old”, because they are directlyattached to the verb they modify, and are neither constructed periphrastically (see
chapter 9) nor do they go back to the innovated verbal complexes (see chapter
10). Two of these extension, passive and causative, belong to the category of
voice, the third one is a marker of plurality, either of subjects, object or of ac-tions.","[110, 111]"
"In the last lines of document36, we get to knowaboutthe fee for the scribe who was paid in kind. He was supposed to receive one kolin tewiti which corresponds to modern Dongolese/Kenzi kal deewdi ‘flat bread’.
kol- is merely a variant of kal- described above. The alternative use of vowels o
and a is documented again in the same text with kap- and kop- ‘to eat’.
In the documentary text from Qasr Ibrim, it can be observed that foreign words
or loanwords from Arabic enter into Old Nobiin. In the sales contract IT III 36, the
Arabic word ouati ‘wadi, valley’ is used, only documented in one other instancein Sale 9 as wati. The use of Arabic wadi is remarkable because regarding the
modern languages, it is restricted to Kenzi. In Nobiin, we find the original farki
or the much more common Arabic loan khor both meaning ‘valley’. Armbruster
(1965:103) lists the latter in the form hoor also for Dongolese.
Finally, egeti ‘kettle’ is another word which is found only in this text and in
modemKenzi, but not in Modern Nobiin.",[21]
"When the first pieces of medieval literature were discovered, the writing was
deciphered and the linguistic affiliation was identified, it seemed natural to call it12osises SinesAs part of the European historical periodization, the term “medieval period” and
the concept behind it cannot and should not easily and uncritically be transferredOld Nubian, although Griffith (1913:68) in the first comprehensive editing of the
then known texts remarked that “the agreement with the Fadija-Mahass dialect
[= today’s Nobiin] as opposed to the Kenzi-Dongolese dialect is very clearly
marked”. It is recommended here that the term “Old Nubian” should be altogether abandoned in favor of the more accurate “Old Nobiin”.
The present study is not a work of linguistic theory but it also doesn’t restrict
itself to mere descriptions of different language states. It tries to reveal processes
of language change and grammaticalization from Old to Moder Nobiin but also
within Old and Modern Nobiin respectively. Although the development and
changes in the nominal and pronominal systems are discussed, the focus was put
on the verbal morphology and syntax. Nevertheless, this book can only represent
the beginning of the study of language change in Nobiin. In 1991, the mentor of
Old Nobiin studies, the late G. Michael Browne, expressed what he regarded as
desiderata of future scholarly work. On top of his list he posted the need for a
diachronic grammar which would treat the relationship between Old and Modern
Nobiin but also diachronic patterns within Old Nobiin. This study hopefully is a
first step towards this end. As most of the work on Old Nobiin has been done by
classical scholars and the texts are available only in non-transcribed and nonsegmented form, the numerous examples from the texts may also serve to interest scholars with different backgrounds for the interesting subject of language
change in Nobiin.","[12, 13]"
"3.2.1 SubjectiveTraditionally, -/ was interpreted as definite article (Zylahrz1928:34; Werner1987:83). As early as 1975, Hintze demonstrated that -(i)/ marks the subject of a
verbal or nominal sentence. The suffix is not used with pronouns or proper
names. In some phonological environment, -/ is deleted (i. e. sal- ‘word’, for sal-l,Browne 2002:33). Examples are

"Besides its system of five vowels, Old Nobiin had several diphthong phonemes which were /ai/, /aw/, /ew/, /iu/, and /oi/ which are still present in the modern variant. Old Nobiin occasionally marked vowel length in its orthography, but
there is no minimal pair with length as a distinctive feature. Furthermore, in
words which have a long vowel in Modern Nobiin vowel length alternates in the
Old Nobiin orthography, as in gar-/gaar- ‘shore, side’ or nog-/noog- ‘house’.
Vocalic alternations are a characteristic feature of Old and Modern Nobiin and
include frequent variation between a and e, e and i, o and i, and sometimes o and
u. Whether all of these are dialectal in origin as Werner (1987:46) and Browne(2002:15) proposed is difficult to decide.
Old and Modern Nobiin are rather similar with regard to their phonology, butsome interesting features and important changes have to be discussed here. If we27take a look at the distribution of nasals in Old Nobiin we find 7 restricted to
medial and final position, m and y to initial and medial position, and 2 to medial
position. In Modern Nobiin, the velar nasal is only word medial or final. In mostof the words with initial 7 we find 1 in present day Nobiin, as e. g. in
Old NobiinModern Nobiinnaln0(0)k-nalnoog-‘to see’
“house’In some words, however, initial g replaces the velar nasal:
narnalnol-gaarga(r)gol()-‘to keep, hold’
‘son’
‘to gulp down’This discrepancy might be either due to dialectal variation within Nobiin or the
result of language contact.
Zyhlarz (1928:9) was the first to discuss the phonetic nature of Old Nobiin A
which is supposed to represent and is normally transcribed as d. Already in Old
Nobiin, however, there are some examples of alternation between A and P /r/,e. g. in
ar-/adoar-/oade~oro/-odo‘to seize’
‘night’
‘before’It was therefore proposed that P originally might have represented some sort ofretroflex sound. The situation in Modern Nobiin supports this hypothesis insofar,
as we find alternating correspondences to Old Nobiin A in medial and final position (r is not found word initial). Although A is represented by d in most of the
words, examples for corresponding r are documented in:
Old Nobiin
nod
nodeModern Nobiin
nor
nore‘Lord’
‘termite’tidmid-tirmir-‘to encounter, meet’
‘run’The most significant and obvious regular sound change in the system of conso-nant phonemes is the one of Old Nobiin p to Moder Nobiin fin word initial and
final position, as in‘Old NobiinModern Nobiinpagpal-fagfal-‘share’
“to come out’park-farki-‘valley depression’28dappdipp-daffdiffi-“to perish’
“town, city’Although exceptions are documented, f doesn’t belong to the system of consonant phonemes of Old Nobiin. In one of the Qasr Ibrim texts (IT II 16 iv 5), we
find a first instance of fi- ‘to be’ otherwise always documented as pi-.
There are some exceptions to this otherwise regular sound change, e. g.
Old NobiinModern Nobiinap(p)kap-aabkab-“to grasp”
‘to eat’In these instances, -p- was presumably not regarded as word final, because suffixes had to be attached. In medial position, however, the regular correspondence
to Old Nobiin p is 5, as in
Old NobiinModern Nobiinipol
kumpu
torpar
tipitiboo
kumbo
torbar
tibit‘your father’
‘egg’
‘farmer’
‘wave’To a certain extent, consonantal variation occurs which is probably due to dialec-tal variation within Old Nobiin. These variations can be observedbetweenvoiced and voiceless consonants, as between g and k. In Old Nobiin, for exam-ple, ak- and ag- ‘to sit’ alternate in the texts. This alternation is lost in Modern
Nobiin where only ag- is found.
Ever since Herman Bell’s article from 1968 we know that Nobiin is a tone
language. Tone was, however, not marked in the orthography of Old Nobiin, and
we don’t know anything about its tonal structure and changes in tone from Old to
Modern Nobiin. Therefore, tone is not marked in any of the Nubian examples in
this book.","[27, 28, 29]"
"2.4 Modern Nobiin and the Nubian Language Family
Several times now, the Dongolese/Kenzi language has been mentioned besides
Nobiin and a few notes concerning their relationship seem to be appropriate.
At least since the beginning of the 20th century, it has been claimed that a genetically defined Nubian language family consisting of a Nile Nubian and a Hill
(Kordofanian) Nubian subgroup, Birgid (spoken in Southern Darfur and now
extinct) and Midob (in Northern Darfur) exists. Attempts at classification for a
long time focused on the languages of the so-called Nile Nubian branch whichwere known to the European linguistic community much longer than other Nubian languages. The group was divided into the Mahas/Fadijja language on the
one side, and the Dongolese/Kenzi language on the other side. For the Mahas/Fadijja continuum, Bell introduced the self-designation Nobiin in 1974. The
initially implicit assumption that the geographically adjacent Nubian languages
of the Nile valley were also more closely related genetically became explicit in
the discussion of the homeland of the Nubians. Basically, two alternatives were
proposed: Either the Darfur and Hill Nubians were fugitives from the Nile Valley
or the Nile Nubians migrated from an original homeland somewhere in the west
of the Nile. The problem of the homeland was solved more than twenty years
ago (Behrens 1981, Thelwall 1982, Bechhaus-Gerst 1984/85) and will not be
discussed here. More importantly, however, it was also shown that geographic
adjacency of languages and their speakers does not necessarily imply a particularly close genetic relationship. In the course of several studies (Bechhaus-Gerst
1984/85, 1989, 1996), it could be proven that speakers of the different Nubian
languages of the Nile Valley undoubtedly reached the region at a time interval of
more than 1500 years. The first arrivals were the predecessors of the Nobiin at
about 1500 BC, followed by the early Dongolese/Kenzi at the beginning of theCommon Era. It could furthermore be shown that a genetically defined Nile Nubian group never existed, but that the close relationship between the modern languages was caused by intensive language contact. The Nobiin language in fact
constitutes an isolated branch of the Nubian language family, whereas the Dongo-22lese/Kenzi language is genetically closely related to the Hill Nubian languages of
Kordofan. Nobiin and Dongolese/Kenzi were and are not mutually intelligible.
Additional remarks concerning the term Dongolese/Kenzi seem to be required. Dongolese and Kenzi are closely related languages which can be classified as dialects, although they were and are not spoken in adjacent regions. Don-golese is spoken to the south and Kenzi to the north of the Nobiin speech area.
This is a relatively recent development. It is known from written sources that the
Kenzi dialect came into being in the course of the 13th and 14th centuries when
the Arab Beni Kanz became the Nubian Kenzi through intermarriage with Nubians from Dongola, as a result of which language shift from Arabic to Nubian
took place. This variant of Dongolese, spoken by the Beni Kanz developed into
what is known as the Kenzi language.
This book deals with language change in Nobiin but it doesn’t actually discuss
the reasons for the different kinds of change. Although in each case presented
below arguments for an internal development might be found, much of what will
be analyzed must be regarded as a result of the language contact addressed
above. The sociolinguistic setting and its consequences have been studied in
detail in Bechhaus-Gerst (1996) and need not be repeated here. At this point,
however, it should be noted that the Nobiin language underwent significant
changes which for the most part can be traced back to a long-term and intensive
contact with speakers of Dongolese/Kenzi and presumably Arabic and Beja
speakers who either learnt Nobiin as second language or shifted to Nobiin as
their first language. The consequences of this process were classified as “‘interference through shift” (see e. g. Thomason & Kaufman 1988) which results from
imperfect learning during a process of language acquisition. Speakers shifting to
a so-called target language “‘fail” to learn the new language perfectly, but keepsome of the features of their original language or continue to make “mistakes”
when using the new language. These features or “mistakes” may even spread to
the target language when they are imitated by speakers of that language. Thomas
& Kaufmann (ibid., 39) point out that interference through shift begins with
sound and syntax and may even include morphology before words of the original
language appear in the target language.
Because of its status as a quasi-official language in medieval Nubia, Old Nobiin doubtlessly represented a target language for speakers of other languages of
the Nubian Nile Valley and its hinterland. Social and economic mobility was
presumably dependent on linguistic skills including a certain competence in Old
Nobiin. This situation only changed when Old Nobiin lost its prestigious position
to Arabic, a process which started in the 13th century, but was not completed until
the end of the 15th century when Old Nobiin was no longer employed in writing.","[22, 23]"
"Although in this sentence -j- could be interpreted as an intensifier, Abel explains
the context as repetitive, i. e. plurality of action is supposed to be indicated. In
his notes, he therefore translates ‘every time the boy does something wrong’. Theuse of the phrase nahar-ee-ka ‘one day’, however, contradicts Abel’s translation.
Plurality of subjects seems to be indicated in the next example:
(Erm. 131)
belel-le
ju-a
village-in go-ADJmasani
goodsultaniiiga-tir-oonsultansay-BEN-3SGPREToogr-ana-iye
_call-IMPERPL-(they said]oogr-ek-kac-e-isan-goni
—_(-c- instead of -j-)
call-take-come-PL-3PLPRET-and““go into the village, good, call (him)”, and when they fetched and brought him, the sultan said to
him’Abel compares the use of -/- (here as voiceless -c-) in this example with a corresponding passage in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel where we find anotherexample for marking of the plurality of subject:
(GM 7, 32)
tal-logmumurnecjwee-kaa_ekkac-c-isanhe-tomutedeafone-OB)(-c- instead of -j-)take-come-PL-3PLPRET‘They brought to him a deaf-mute.’It can be summarized that the suffix -/- asserted its position as marker of plurality, either of subject, object or action—the last one additionally having developed117into an intensifier—over the course of the centuries without any indication of
erosion or a tendency towards loss.","[117, 118]"
"If Abel’s translation can be trusted some sort of emphatic connotation can still
be deducted for Modern Nobiin, as in the following example:
(Erm. 78)
ir-i
kutt-akumbuu-n-gifirmalick-ka__dett-agammi-kac-c-ayouegg-GEN-shellall-oBJgather-PLOBJ-PREDferif-wee-ka _ ferJ-oos-a

crackle-CONDter-i
they—ik-ka

FUT-ask-3PpL-then (PART)‘if the egg shells crackle, they will ask you’In conclusion one has to state that the origin of the -i/-ii suffix remains obscure.
The object of the personal pronoun is marked by the suffix Old Nobiin -ka;
Modern Nobiin -ga(/-ka) which is the regular nominal case suffix. As can be
seen below, various rules of assimilation produce the actual paradigms. The
Modern Nobiin object suffix is -ga as 1st person singular and plural shows. Al-though in Modern Nobiin the regular assimilation rule produces /r/ + /g/ > /rl’
(Werner 1987:41), the Old Nobiin geminated consonants are preserved which are
the result of the very common Old Nobiin regressive assimilation r + k —> kk.

Old Nobiin has two sets of possessive pronouns which are identical to the genitive of the personal pronouns (see Chapter 3.2.1 on nominal case marking). The
genitive markers -(i)n or -na are suffixed to the personal pronouns and assimila-tion rules operate. The possessive pronoun stands before its noun:
Old Nobiin
IsGan, annaIPL excl.
incl.un, unna
en, enna2
3in, inna
tan, tanna2
3un, unna
ten, tennaThe difference between the two sets is not easy to determine. The longer forms
are predicatives by origin (GEN -m + PRED -a). In many examples, the shorter -nforms can be regarded as simple possessives whereas the others can be described
as objective genitives or as dependent upon a noun in the predicative or the subject of a verbal noun, e. g.
(M. 12.2-3)
intanna_kip-silthishiseat-PARTPRETII‘this which he ate’ = lit.: ‘this his having eaten’In many phrases, however, the distinction seems to be blurred and it can be concluded that it already was under way to disappear at the Old Nobiin stage documented by the written texts.
The two sets of possessives represent the Old Nobiin standard. Fortunately,
unassimilated forms are preserved mostly in translation of parts of the Old Testament. These show more archaic forms than the bulk of texts:
2sG
3sG
3PLirin
tarin
terin(Browne 1987:77)
(IT 12120)
(Browne 1987:87)A third set of possessives is found, for example, in the letters from Qasr Ibrimbut is notably absent in nearly all the religious-theological texts. Zyhlarz pro-55posed that these pronouns were only present, when the possessive is independent
or used as apposition to its noun. The forms found in letters from Qasr Ibrim are:
1sG
2sGanni
inni(IT III 52.5, Browne 1984:55)
(IT HI, 26.1; IT Hl. 5717)3sGtanni(IT III, 51.4,6)IPLenni(Browne, ibid.)These possessives follow the noun and represent a late development of Old Nobiin which leads over to Modern Nobiin. Their constructions correspond to nominalized attributives where genitival -n is suffixed to an adverb or postpositional phrase. In the few Old Nobiin examples, we find postpositions attached to
the pronouns, as e. g. in anni-kille ‘to me’ (lit.: ‘to of mine’, IT III 52.5) or annika ‘me’ (lit.: ‘that of mine’, St. 10.10-11).
According to Werner (1987:117ff.), Modern Nobiin has three sets of posses-sive pronouns. The first one is identical to the genitive of the innovated subject
pronouns with suffixed -i/-ii.
IsGayiinIPLuuiin2
3iriin
tariin2
3uriin
teriinThese pronouns precede the noun, phrase or sentence they are dependent on. In
the sentences collected by Werner, however, as well as in the large Ermenne text,
preceding possessives are restricted to kinship terminology (see below). Only in
Lepsius’ conservative translation of the Gospel according to Marc, we find ex-amples for preceding possessives in constructions such as:
(GM 8,19)
aiyiin
IsGposskaba_ = dija__birti-sin-laa

"21813. Appendix: Nubia in the Medieval Millennium —the Written SourcesThe Nubian Nile Valley is a region where intensive archaeological research has
been undertaken which is comparable only to its northern neighbor Egypt. Colin
Renfrew pointed out that these archaeological investigations also opened up new
possibilities for linguistic studies: “[...] while we cannot expect to find direct
evidence in the archaeological record for a specific prehistoric language or language group, we can indeed study processes of demographic and social change
which we may seek, however hypothetically, to correlate with language change
in those areas” (1987:264).
In the 6th century AD, the Christian historiographers began to write about the
northern Sudan. At first, their main subject was the conversion of Nubia to Christianity, later, they were interested in the unique phenomenon of a stable Christian
kingdom in the immediate neighborhood of Muslim Egypt. When the Muslim
historiographers and geographers began to write about the region not much later
they provided an abundance of information about geography, history, politics and
economy in the northern Sudan. In spite of the many Arab sources, however,
they conveyed only fragments about the political and social situation in Nubia
between the 9th and 15th century. For many scholars, the sources seemed, for
example, to prove that Christianity in Nubia and with it the Nubian kingdom
came to an end when the capital Dongola was conquered in 1323. As it is now
known, the kingdom of Dotawo, which is not mentioned in Arab sources, existec
at least until the end of the 15th century.
In the course of excavations at Qasr Ibrim, numerous Old Nobiin documents
have been found and edited which constitute the basis for the linguistic analyses
of Old Nobiin in this book. Although we are able to translate most of the written
remains, our knowledge of the context is often too inadequate to actually understand what the texts talk about. Adams (1996:244) states: “For the time being
they [the texts] may be said to enrich our picture of mediaeval Nubian life without significantly clarifying it, inasmuch as they raise perhaps as many questions
as they answer.” One of the problems Adams and others seem to find difficult to
deal with stems from the discrepancies between the content of Old Nobiin and
otherwrittensources.","[218, 219]"
"11.3.4 Causal ClausesIn Old Nobiin, several postpositional elements could be employed to construct causal clauses. (-lo)-joa, -lejoun/-lojun, jurro, -juria are all derived from _jur- ‘cause’.
In the first example from the Menas legend, the main clause is in the impera-tive and the causal clause has the tense/aspect/person marker of the preterit II
subjunctive followed by the subordinating conjunction. The subject of the causal
clause is the object of the main clause:
(M. 11.8-9)
ai-ka
I-OB)aul-ose-e
save-DIR-IMPERSGnape-k
sin-OB)au-esi-lojun
do-lPRETIISUB-because (of)*,..save me because I have committed sin.”",[204]
"10. Grammaticalization of Verbal Complexes10.1 Introduction
The loss of periphrastic constructions in the development from Old to Modern
Nobiin coincided with an increasing use of constructions involving so-calledadjunctive -a (see chapter 5.2). Zyhlarz (1928:111) was the first author who
recognized an additional function of predicative -a. It is used in so-called verbal
complexes of Old Nobiin. Verbal complexes are verb strings with two or moreverbs sharing a common subject where verbal morphology only occurs on the
last verb. The other verb(s) often take(s) predicative -a which, however, may be
elided. In accordance with Hintze (1975:16), the -a element in these formations
is called “adjunctive”, although it is presumably identical to the predicative. The
verbal complexes show many characteristic features of serial verb constructions,
but differ in that, for example, overt markers of coordination are possible. Al-though the numerous authors dealing with serial verb constructions in the languages of the world do not always agree on what is absolutely necessary to de-fine one, the absence of this kind of overt marking is listed by Aikhenvald
(2006:1): “A serial verb is a sequence of verbs which act together as a single
predicate, without any overt marker of coordination, subordination, or syntactic
dependency of any other sort.” In many instances, the different verbs constitute a
single predicate and the serial verb construction describes what is conceptualized
as a single event. Aikhenvald (2006:4ff.) lists the following typical formal andsemantic properties:
1. Serial verb constructions act as single predicates.
2. Serial verb constructions are monoclausal and allow no markers of syntacticdependency on their components.
3. The verbs in a serial verb construction share tense/aspect, mood,
and polarity value.
4. Serial verb constructions refer to one overall event.modality,Although, as some examples show, verbal complexes may have typical features
of serial verb construction, they more often seem to agree with what can be
called “clause chaining”. DeLancey (1991), who analyzed Tibeto-Burman Lhasa,137describes constructions which express sequences of events. One or more verb(s)
take(s) non-final affixes and is/are followed by a finite verb with tense/aspect/
mood affixes. Although most of the constructions analzyed by DeLancey refer tomultiple events, there are some verbs occurring as final and finite verbs which
combine with preceeding non-final verbs to express single events. The verb ‘go’
for example expresses distal directionality as final verb. In these constructions,
DeLancey argues, the last verbs became reanalyzed as aspect markers. Having
undergone this process they may occur with non-final markers. DeLancey speaks
of ‘serialized’ verbs in this context. It will be demonstrated below that similar
developments can be observed in Old Nobiin.","[135, 136, 137, 138]"
"3.2.4 A Note on the -u SuffixThroughout this study nouns are occasionally cited ending in -u. Zyhlarz
(1928:31) and others regarded the ending as “appositive” or status appositivus,
an interpretation which Browne (2002:37) vehemently and correctly rejects. -u is
a phonologically conditioned juncture element which interchanges with -i. Both
are inserted between words or clauses that closely cohere, but are only required
when the first word ends in two consonants and are optional everywhere else.
The usage seems to have been dependent on the respective scribe.",[37]

"The origins of the second paradigm in Modern Nobiin are difficult to determine.
One explanation would relate the different endings to the Old Nobiin interrogative -ha which assimilated to the endings of the present or past. But this would
be contradicted by the meager evidence where in one of the two instances -ha issuffixed to the question word and not to the verb. On the other hand, the use of
-ha after the verb could have been generalized while at the same time its use102——what-you-CONT-sick-CAUS-2SGINTERROGPRES-[DS]after the interrogative pronoun could have been lost. At the moment, this explanation looks like the most plausible, although it cannot be proven.","[102, 103]"
"10.3 Indirect Object, Applicative, Benefactive
Old Nobiin has two independent verbs with the meaning ‘to give’, fir- ‘to give
someone (2""4/3'd person)’ and den- ‘to give to me/us (1st person)’. They are oftenused as second verbs in verbal complexes where they follow adjunctive -a. Ina
typical complex, the verb jan- ‘to exchange, to trade’ takes as a second verb fir‘to give’ and generates the meaning ‘to sell’. There are numerous examples ofthis combination in the sale contracts of Qasr Ibrim. It resembles the -(o)oscomplex in that a motion away from the speaker (tir-) seems to be implied.
jan(a)-os- and jan-a tir- ‘to sell’ were used side by side in Old Nobiin but onlythe first seems to have survived with this meaning in modern times (see below).
142The development of fir-/den- in verbal complexes is completely different from
the one of -(oJ)os/-ed which indicates that its function was different from theoutset. The next two examples demonstrate the above-mentioned complexes with
jan- ‘to trade, to exchange’. The second one includes both verbs, tir- and den-, in
one sentence:

Pampigon his wife.’The first sentence has two nouns marked as objects. Old Nobiin, as has been
shown before, does not distinguish morphologically between direct or indirectobjects. Although directionality might have figured in the use of tir-/den-, a different function seems to be predominant.","[142, 143]"
"Browne (ibid.) analyzed the Old Nobiin verbal syntax on the basis of different
elements suffixed to the predicates of the “clause conjugation”. These elements
are the so-called “postpositions of conversion to sentence status” or “sentence
converters”. They help to convert a “clause conjugation” into a “sentence conjugation”. He distinguished between the “primary sentence conjugation” which is65formed directly from the “clause conjugation” and the “secondary sentence con-jugation”, which is built upon the “primary sentence conjugation”.
The most important formant of the “primary sentence conjugation” is predicative -a, which can also mark nominal predicates. If -a is suffixed to a participle,the so-called predicative emerges. Again, person and number are not morphologically marked. The subject must be expressed and marked as such ifit is anoun and cannot be understood within the context. If the predicative -a is suffixed to the endings of the subjunctive the indicative emerges which also hasperson and number suffixes. A nominal subject has to be marked by the suffix
-(i)I. One of the periphrastic constructions, the so-called periphrastic predicative,
also belongs here.
The origin of the different constructions of the “primary sentence conjugation” can be represented as follows:
subject
nounpredicate
subjunctiveindicative-|pronoun+-a=
participle
participle+ -in=predicative
periphrastic predicativeWhat Browne (ibid.) called “secondary sentence conjugation” emerges by suffixing certain elements to the indicative or predicative. Most of these constructions
belong to the periphrastic constructions or the copulative. The most common ofthe former are the “predicative periphrastic” and the “indicative periphrastic”
which are formed by combining a predicative or indicative with the verb -in ‘to
be’ or an equivalent (see in detail below chapter 9). The periphrastic indicative
seems to have an emphatic function whereas the periphrastic predicative is interpreted as a stylistic variant of the non-periphrastic constructions.","[65, 66]"
"11.3 Complex and Compound Sentences
In Old Nobiin the verb in subordinate or complement clauses is either marked as
participle or subjunctive. Both are verbal nouns and do not take the predicative
marker -a. The subjunctive differs from the participle in that person and numberare overtly expressed in the first. The participle can therefore only be used when
its subject is identical to the one in the main clause or to be understood from thecontext. This restriction is parallel to the one described above for the predicative
in the main clause. If expressed, the subject of the participle is regularly in the
genitive. With the subjunctive, the subject is either marked as genitive or as subjective depending on the type of construction.
Although exceptions can be observed, it can be said about tenses/aspects ofthe participle or subjunctive that regularly the present marks time contemporaneous with that of the main verb, the preterit time anterior and the future time posterior with that of the main verb (comp. Browne 1989:40).",[188]
"524, Pronouns4.1 Personal Pronouns
The following pronouns function as the subject of a clause. In Old Nobiin, the
so-called juncture vowel -u- could be suffixed. For the 1st person plural, Old
Nobiin had a distinction between inclusive and exclusive. This distinction is lost
in ModemNobiin which only retained the former exclusive -u-. Otherwise, thesubject pronouns remained unchanged.

case marker -i/. As, however, the subject pronouns are not marked for case in Old
Nobiin this is highly improbable. A semantic difference between the two sets is
not indicated by the texts. It seems possible that the -i/-ii suffix is a former juncture vowel. As has been described above we find an annective -u or -i between
elements which closely cohere. This can be the case with appositions and attributives but it also optionally binds postpositions to the preceding nouns or phrases
and pronouns to the rest of the sentences. Although most examples show the
vowel -u, -i can occasionally be found:53(IT1412)
it-i
inno
you— douar[aJenkantherebe-COND‘if you had been there’Personal pronouns with suffixed juncture vowels -u or -i are rather widespread inOld Nobiin texts so that the modern paradigm might go back to Old Nobiin pronouns plus juncture vowel. Browne (1991:288) has, however, pointed out that
even in Old Nobiin, the juncture vowel is more often missing than present andthat the unmotivated changes between -u and -i may actually indicate some sort
of neutral vowel, such as a. Here, we find two counter-arguments against the
proposed origin of the second set of modern subject pronouns.","[52, 53, 54]"
"5.1 “Clause Conjugation” and “Sentence Conjugation”
The smallest unit which represents a complete predication in Old Nobiin consists
of a subject marked as genitive and a predicate which is either a participle or the
subjunctive. As it is attested only as a subordinate clause Browne (1982:11)
called it clause conjugation. He represented its components as follows:
clause conjugation:subject
nounpredicate
participle
+ -n(a)pronounsubjunctiveParticiple and subjunctive are verbal nouns. The subjunctive is formed by suffixing personal endings to the different participles. Thus, it overtly expresses person
and number in contrast to the participle. Application of various phonological
rules generates the different endings presented in chapters 6.1 and 6.2. Unless the
subject of the participle is identical to the one of the main clause or to be taken
from the context it has to be expressed. The subjunctive must be used if the subject is not evident.",[65]
"This de-nominalderivationcorrespondsto OldNobiinune-katt-‘wise’ from une- ‘understanding’. There is no evidence that -gatti is productive
in Modern Nobiin and seems to be present only in lexicalized from.
Another suffix in the context of word formation which is present in Old Nobiin and still productive in the modern variant is the denominative and deverbal
abstract noun formant
-ittaru-ittiskel-itt-as in
‘irrigation’
“request, prayer’from
fromaruiskel-‘rain’
“to beg’Werner (1987:87) lists ewitti- ‘field work’, fayitti ‘scripture’, and uwitti ‘second’
as examples for the productive suffix in Modern Nobiin. The last two are interesting because the corresponding words in Old Nobiin look quite different. Modern Nobiin faay- ‘to write’ corresponds to Old Nobiin par-. The phonological
changes are regular ones. Instead of the deverbal noun *paritti- ‘scripture’, however, pa(a)rt- and pait- ‘scripture, writing’ are found in the Old Nobiin texts. Of
quite a different nature is the example of wwitti ‘second’ from uwwo ‘two’. In
Modern Nobiin, ordinals are regularly formed by suffixing -itti to the cardinals.",[49]
