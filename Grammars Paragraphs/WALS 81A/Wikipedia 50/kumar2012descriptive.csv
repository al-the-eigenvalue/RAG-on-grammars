by the use of pronominals.
5.3.5 Verbal morphology
Like nouns, verbs are also classified into two categories: bound roots and free
roots. Only forms which are exclusively used for humans are bound roots. For
instance, ənətəhə ‘sit [HUMAN]’ has two morphemes, ən and ətəhə, because this
form has other forms like mətəhə ‘I sit’, əhitəhə ‘s/he/they sit’, and ənətəhə ‘you sit’.
For other animals oho ‘sit [NON-HUMAN] is used.
Jarawa does not show tense or aspect marking on the verbs, nor does it have
agreement marked on the verbs. However, a verb takes suffixes and prefixes
with the proviso that only one prefix and one suffix can attach to the verb at a
time. The principle function of suffixes in this language is to convey mood,
modality, and evidentiality; the prefix indicates the presence of the direct object.
This prefix is always the 3rd person pronoun and referred to as co-referencing
element in the present work. Further, personal pronouns, used as S and O
arguments of a verb, also get prefixed if there is no intervening element between
pronoun and verb. A verb that starts with a vowel may also take the
definiteness/referential marker as a prefix, provided there is no intervening
element between the definiteness/referential marker and the verb.
5.4 Word order typology of Jarawa
Though the term “word order typology” was in use for a long time, it was
Greenberg who brought the discipline to the forefront. Greenberg (1963) refers to
linguistic typology as a field which discusses the linguistic patterns of language
vis-à-vis some attributes. For instance, if a language is VSO, it will have
203204prepositions. These kinds of attributes are discussed in length in Greenberg
(1963). Basically, linguistic patterns were discussed with features like the
canonical pattern of subject, verb and object with reference to adpositions, nounadjective relations, noun-genitive relations, and noun-numeral relations. This
section focuses on word order in clauses, the position of the adposition, order of
noun-adjective, noun-genitive, noun-numeral, adjective-intensifier, verb-adverb,
and so on. This section will also investigate syntactic and morphological features
correlating with the word order as proposed by Greenberg (1963).
5.4.1 Word order in clauses
Typologically, word order in clauses means the order of subject, object and verb.
The order of these three elements determines the ordering of other pairs of
elements in the language. For example, if a language is SOV, there is a greater
chance that the language will have postpositions. Thus the order of subject,
object, and verb may determine the order of noun and adposition.
Jarawa is an SOV language: the subject precedes the object and the object
precedes the verb. This occurs in simple sentences which have a subject, a sigle
object, and a verb. But when a simple sentence has two objects, the pattern may
be subject, direct object, indirect object, and verb. Or it may be subject, indirect
object, direct object, and verb. The difference between the two is that when the
direct object is moved to the position immediately after the subject, the verb
contains the information that there is a direct object inside the clause (for the
difference in representation of direct and indirect object, see § 4.3.4). Let us
consider the following examples.","[220, 221, 222]"
"In the case of ditransitives, the direct object and indirect object exhibit free word
order between them, but follow the overall SOV in which the subject precedes
the direct object, and direct object precedes the verb.

"1331343.8 Copula {ʈʰi}
The morpheme {ʈʰi} has various usages in this language. It is used for identifying
an entity, or to qualify a noun. This morpheme also comes with the negative
particle, if the negative particle is used for short responses. It is also used with
spatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morpheme appears with verbs
when the verb is used in adverbial relation to the main verb. Based on the
different usages of {ʈʰi}, it can be termed a copula in this language.
Unlike the verb which follows the object, this copula precedes the nominal
predicates or adjectival predicates. Jarawa is an SOV language. The expected
word order is noun, then nominal predicate or adjectival predicate, followed by
copula. However, the copula is used between the subject and the nominal
predicate or adjectival predicate.","[151, 152]"
"4.3.4Ditansitive clausesIn ditransitive clauses, a ditransitive verbal predicate heads the clause, and has
three core arguments, A, IO, and DO. The IO and DO are part of O, are divided
according to their functions and usage in the clause.
The order of A and ditransitive verbs is fixed. A precedes the O (IO and DO) and
the ditransitive verb follows the O, as in transitive clauses. However, the order of
the objects is not fixed. The IO can follow the DO or precede it. Nonetheless, the
position of ɖi is fixed. Since ɖi is employed to specify the Object NP, it moves
with the direct object. The clausal structure of a ditransitive construction is given
in (4.44). The example (4.45) demonstrates the ordering of A, O, and verb in
ditransitive clauses.

"1871884.9.1Grammatical relationsDifferent grammatical roles and the relations between them can be expressed by
various means at the syntactic level. Some languages employ case marking to
differentiate the different roles of the core arguments; some languages resort the
fixed word order for the same purpose. In the case of Jarawa, grammatical
relations between arguments are expressed through referential marking.
Jarawa does not demonstrate any kind of case marking on its core arguments S,
A and O. It does, however, use a referential marker, usually with S or O, rarely
with A. This rareness of its use with the A of a transitive verb suggests that this
referential marker ɖi is employed to indicate grammatical relations. These
grammatical relations entail that this language follows ergativity-absolutive
patterns; however, the context for the use of ergativity-absolutive is
referentiality/definiteness. The other strategy to differentiate S/O from A is
specific to pronominal arguments and deals with prefixation of S/O to the verb
which is not possible with A.
Let us look first at pronominals. Pronominals never take ɖi, but can be prefixed
to verbs if a verb begins with a vowel. It has been observed in section 3.3.1.1 that
prefixation of pronominals to verbs is possible only for S or O pronominals, and
not A pronominals. For example, in (4.133) we have prefixation of the S
argument to the verb aʈiba ‘say’. Similarly in (4.133) the O argument of the verb
əjojəba ‘see’ is prefixed.","[205, 206]"
"196197Chapter 5: Jarawa and Typology5.0 Introduction
The present study is a descriptive grammar of Jarawa. I would like to now
investigate the data in order to determine the position of Jarawa in a typological
framework. So far Chapter 2 described the phonetics and phonology of Jarawa;
Chapter 3 investigated the morphological properties of Jarawa; Chapter 4 was an
attempt to discuss the syntactic structures in the language. This chapter will
investigate which kinds of typological patterns this language demonstrates.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.1 contains an overview of
typology, including morphological typology and word order typology
formulated by Greenberg, and the developments which followed (Hawkins
(1983), Dryer (1992, 2007)). Section 5.2 presents a general outline of the typology
of Jarawa. Section 5.3 gives the morphological typology of Jarawa. Section 5.4
aims at the word order typology of Jarawa with reference to Greenberg (1963). A
brief conclusion is presented in section 5.5.
5.1 Language typology
Typology literally means the study of types. In linguistics, typology means the
study and classification of languages according to their structural features.
However, typology differs from general classification and taxonomy. According
to Marradi (1990) classification in general means the attributes are considered
one at a time, and entails that the classification is built on a single attribute at
each level. Classification means division of attributes at one level; at another
197198level another attribute will be considered, to split the group further. In
taxonomy, the attributes are considered in succession, while in typology multiple
attributes are taken together to group languages.
The term “typology” was introduced in linguistics in the 19th century by the
Schlegel brothers, as an attempt to classify the languages of world based on a
morphological criterion, i.e. how morphemes combine into words. Based on this
morphological criterion, there were three types of languages: isolating,
agglutinating, and fusional. Sapir added a new type, called synthetic. Another
kind of classification emerged with Greenberg’s seminal work (1957) on word
order typology. In this work he took multiple attributes to define a type.
…the simultaneous application of a set of individual criteria, a process which can be
conveniently conceptualized in terms of a multidimensional attribute space. The
attributes will presumably be chosen in that they represent closely related aspects of
the same general class of phenomena which may reasonably be expected to reveal
significant mutual connections.
(Greenberg (1957:76)Comrie (1988) stipulates that the main concern of typology is to find language
universals, but at the same time diversity is observed in languages; the objective
is also to explain why languages demonstrate such diversity. Comrie (1981) has
described three reasons for languages to have common structural properties, (a)
due to genetic relatedness, (b) due to contact, and (c) due to the general
characteristics of human language. In his opinion, typologists are concerned with
the third one. Bickel (2007) discusses the concern of the 21st century typologist.
He says that typologists in 21st century are interested in developing the variables
to capture crosslinguistic similarities and differences, to explore universal and198199local skewings in the distribution of these variables, and finally to propose and
explain why we have such skewing. He further states that our ultimate goal is to
describe what is where and why. Thus typological classification is not only
restricted to finding out the properties shared by languages but to explain why
languages differ from each other.
5.2 Phonological typology of Jarawa
In a discussion of typological features of the phonology of a language, the
following points are generally discussed:
i)Whether the language is tonal or non-tonal.ii)Which kind of vowel system has been adopted?iii)Which kind of distinction is present at consonantal level?iv)What is the syllabic structure?v)What kinds of syllabic structure are common in this language at word
level?","[214, 215, 216, 217]"
"If a whole noun phrase is possessed, the order will be as presented in (5.19). In
this language demonstratives and possessors are in complementary distribution.",[227]
"4.7.2Wh-questionIn wh-questions in Jarawa, some NPs in the clause are replaced corresponding
question words (interrogative pronouns/adverbs). The wh-words stay in situ, i.e.
the question word used for the subject NP would stay in canonical subject
position and the question word used for the object NP would stay in canonical
object position. Other question words (interrogative adverbs like when and
where) also appear in canonical positions. Interrogative sentences with whwords explored below.
1. onne ‘who’
The question word onne ‘who’ is used for humans. It can be employed for the S
argument of an intransitive verb, the A argument of a transitive verb, and an
indirect object (including benefactors).

"7273Chapter 3: Morphology3.0 Introduction
The preceding chapter was a detailed examination of phonetics and phonology
of Jarawa. This chapter focuses on Jarawa morphology with specific emphasis on
different word classes. Jarawa is an agglutinating language and has simple
morphology in terms of affixation, i.e. it takes prefixes and suffixes. There are
two kinds of prefixes: one is pronominal which attaches to verbs, adjectives, and
nouns; the other indicates definiteness or referentiality, and attaches only to
verbs. The principal functions of suffixes are (1) to convey plurality when
attached to nouns, and (2) to express mood, modality, and evidentiality when
attached to verbs. They can also, however, attach to adjectives, where they may
denote either state or evidentiality.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 3.1, a brief
introduction to the concepts of morpheme and word in Jarawa is presented.
Section 3.2 focuses on word classes in Jarawa, and section 3.3 discusses noun
morphology. A detailed examination of Jarawa verb morphology is presented in
section 3.4 and of Jarawa adjectives in 3.5. Section, 3.6 presents adverbs, and
section 3.7 postpositions. Section 3.8 is a discussion of copula, and section 3.9
focuses on word formation. A brief conclusion is presented in 3.10.
3.1 Morpheme/word
The criterion that has been followed throughout the dissertation to identify a
morpheme is: a phonologically defined set of segments having a constant range
7374of meaning in the overall structure of the language is a morpheme. Phonetic
criteria of the production of a defined set of segments in one breath, or with a
pause, have also been taken into consideration, particularly to decide whether
two morphemes are articulated as a word or two different words.
In Jarawa, a morpheme may be a free root which exists independently, as in the
case of /napo/ ‘fish’. It may be a bound root which occurs with obligatory
prefixes (possessive prefixes in the case of a noun) as in ən-oɖə ‘hair’ (where {ən-}
is used as generic possessive marker for humans). Sometimes, a verb may be a
bound root such as ən-ətəhə ‘sit’ (imperative) for humans. In both cases whether
it is the nominal root oɖə ‘hair’ or verbal root ətəhə ‘sit’, they cannot occur
independently if they refer to human beings. The nominal root oɖə ‘hair’ can be
used for the hair of humans as well as non-human animals while verbal root
ətəhə ‘sit’ is only used for human beings. In the case of non-humans, the third
person genitive marker would be used with such a root. For example, if the hair
of a dog is to be referred to, wᵼmə wa-oɖə ‘dog 3POSS-hair’.
Thus, a bound root has to be prefixed with some morpheme(s). There are two
kinds of prefixes which co-occur with nominals: one is the definite genitive
marker (personal possessive pronoun), and the other the generic human
possessive pronoun {ən-}. The morpheme {ən-} is a more obvious choice for
prefixation in case of humans. It has two interpretations in this language; one is a
generic interpretation for humans, and the other, a second person pronominal.
There are other kinds of morphemes which can attach to roots/stems — whether
free or bound — as prefixes or suffixes; these can be classified as bound
morphemes. For instance, the word bəᵼʈʰe-jə ‘go-VEVD’ contains two morphemes;
7475one is bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’ and the other is {-jə} ‘VEVD’. Here bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’ is a free morpheme
and {-jə} ‘VEVD’ is a bound morpheme. A morpheme which occurs as a free root
or bound root, will, in the present study, be referred to as a lexical word, and a
morpheme which has to be attached to a root/stem as an affix, as a bound
morpheme.
3.2 Word classes
In order to identify word classes in Jarawa, it is necessary to go beyond notional
definitions that entail much overlapping. Therefore, a scrutiny of different words
is attempted through different diagnostic tests. Consequently, two more criteria,
morphological diagnosis, and syntactic distribution, have been employed to
identify different word classes in Jarawa. The morphological test is based on the
choice of the occurrences of prefixes and suffixes with the root form. Specifically,
the choice of a prefix or a suffix depends upon the lexical category of the root.
For instance, Tense Aspect and Mood (TAM) category only comes with a verbal
roots or a root used as the verbal predicate of a clause. In the syntactic
distribution test, the occurrences of lexical roots in certain syntactic
configurations have been evaluated. The distribution of lexical roots in a
clause/sentence depends upon the lexical category they belong to. For instance, a
lexical root may occur either as a subject, object, adjunct, or predicate, in a clause.
After scrutiny it was found that Jarawa has six kinds of word classes: noun, verb,
pronoun, adjective, adverb, and postposition. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs are open classes, where nouns and verbs are abundant while adjectives
and adverbs are fewer in number; postpositions and pronouns are closed classes
with a small number of lexemes. In (3.1) these classes are arranged in decreasing
order of the number of words in each class.
7576(3.1) noun > verb > adjective > adverb > pronoun > postposition
3.3 Noun Morphology: Nouns and Noun Phrases
This section focuses on nouns and pronouns, and their morphological behaviour
in the language. The section also discusses other categories that could be part of a
Noun Phrase (NP), and their behaviour within the phrases. An NP can have
noun or pronoun as head. Section 3.3.1 discusses pronouns and their different
forms, section 3.3.2 focuses on nouns and their forms, and section 3.3.3 deals
with the noun phrase and elements which could be part of the noun phrase.
3.3.1PronounsPronouns are heads of NPs. They have no lexical content, and either refers to
some nouns which may have occurred within the sentence, or draw reference
from context. These types of NPs occur at the place of noun-headed NPs to avoid
repetition. There are three kinds of pronouns: personal pronouns (pronominals),
demonstrative pronouns, and interrogative pronouns.
3.3.1.1 Personal pronouns
Jarawa uses personal pronouns to refer to humans and non-humans. It employs
mi as first person, ŋi as second person, and hi as third person pronoun. Second
person has, however, three variants {ŋi, ni, and ən} and third person has two
variants {hi and əhi}. {ən} has two functions in this language. First, it is used as
second person pronominal (generally as subject and possessive forms). Second, it
is used as a pronominal that has generic interpretation for humans. Jarawa
personal pronouns are summed up in table 3.1 below.","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"

There is no overt syntactic case marking in Jarawa to differentiate between nouns
in their different grammatical roles. Generally word order serves this purpose.
Nonetheless Jarawa expresses the semantic case of the noun by means of
postpositions, as shown in example (3.29). A detailed discussion of case marking
is presented in section 3.7.

of two clauses to form causative constructions. This is presented in (3.96).

3.5 Adjectives and Adjective Phrases
Jarawa has descriptive adjectives or what can be called pure adjectives. It has
adjectives (a) related to colour terms, (b) which describe/define a noun, and (c)
which qualify a noun. Numerals and determiners/demonstratives are not
discussed in this section, they are talked about in detail in other sections (for
detailed discussion of numerals, see § 3.3.3.2; for determiners, see § 3.3.3.1).
Jarawa distinguishes between descriptive and other types of adjectives like
numerals, demonstrative adjectives. Syntactically, the word order of descriptive
adjectives is different from that of other types. Though mentioned briefly in the
section on noun phrase, it would be better to go into detail about these adjectives
below.","[141, 142]"
"4.3 Verbal Clauses – I: Core arguments
Apart from verbless clauses, Jarawa has verbal clauses. In a verbal clause, a verb
is the central part of predication. These verbal predicates generally contain core
arguments of the clause, essential express the activity/event, and peripheral
arguments which provide additional information about the activity/event.
As discussed in the section 4.1 as core arguments, a verbal clause can have
subjects (generally referred to S and A) and objects (referred to O). These S, A,
and O are defined as: S, the subject of intransitive verbs; A, the subject of
transitive verbs; and O, the object of transitive verbs. This distinction is very
significant, as these categories have different roles in the grammar of a language.
The category O can further be split into DO and IO. DO is the direct object of the
clause, also called the patient of the clause, which has the direct effect of the152153action. IO does not bear the direct effect of the action; it could be benefactor, goal
etc. The general schema of a clause in Jarawa is given below.
(4.24) [Subject9]NP {[IO]NP [DO]NP} Verb]]VP
Other than core arguments, there are peripheral arguments. These peripheral
arguments provide additional information. They are optional in the clause. These
include temporal and spatial adverbs and/or nouns. The schema given in (4.25)
represents the structure of a clause in Jarawa with peripheral arguments.
(4.25)[Temporaladverb/Nouns]ADVP[Subject]NP{[SpatialAdverbs/Noun]NP} {[Object]NP} Verb]]VP
In addition to these broad categories are smaller categories like referential
marker (see § 4.9), locational marker (see § 3.7), and others. These categories
emerge in certain specific contexts in a clause.
4.3.1Intransitive clausesIn intransitive clauses, Jarawa employs S arguments of intransitive verbs as core
arguments, and intransitive verbs as the head of predication. There are some
denominalised verbs which function as intransitive verbs. We may put these
denominalised verbs in two categories, one in which they form part of weathertype constructions, and another in which they form part of transitive verbs
(semantically); however, syntactically, they behave as intransitive verbs of the
clause (for detailed discussion, see § 4.3.2). Generally, intransitive clauses in
Jarawa can be formed as given in (4.26).","[170, 171]"
"5.4.6 Noun-adjective order
Jarawa adjectives follow the noun. However, this language distinguishes
between descriptive adjectives and demonstratives/numerals. Descriptive
adjectives follow the noun. In example (5.14) huʈʰu ‘big’ follows the noun paʈʰo
‘arrow’.

4.6 Imperative clauses
Jarawa does not use distinct expressions for requests and command, nor does the
language have any kind of morphological marking to show imperatives.
Syntactically, the predicate with its core argument expresses all types of
imperatives, whether request, command, advice, or order.
4.6.1Simple imperative clausesSimple imperative clauses in Jarawa use a verbal predicates with its core
argument; that is, (transitive) verb + object NP. Sometimes they make use of
vocative forms in such constructions, though there is no different morphological
form for vocatives; the name of the person referred to is used as it is. The schema
in (4.74) presents this structure, and is followed by examples.

"3.9.4Empty morphemeAn empty morpheme has been observed attached to nouns. The meaning of this
empty morpheme is not clear, hence it is classified as “empty”. It is generally
attached to personal names but also to other nouns. It is shown in the examples
(3.130–3.132).

3.10 Conclusion
I have discussed the morphology of Jarawa in this chapter. This included noun
morphology, verbal morphology, and causatives. This chapter also dealt with
other word classes like adjectives, adverbs and postpositions, and discussed
copula constructions. In noun morphology it was observed that pronominalheaded NPs behave differently from nominal-headed NPs.
Jarawa makes use of verifiable evidential, assertive mood, and hypothetical
mood. We have noticed a word order phenomenon in this language, where the
copula precedes the nominal predicates or adjectival predicates.
In the adjective class we found two types of adjectives: (a) descriptive adjectives,
and (b) demonstrative, numerals, and possessives. Descriptive adjectives follow
the noun whereas demonstrative, numerals, and possessives precede the noun.
Adverbs are classified into two groups: (a) intensifiers, and (b) participle forms of
verbs.","[159, 160]"
"4.6.2Prohibitive clausesProhibitives are a kind of command, order, or advice to not to do something. In
Jarawa, these are formed by putting the negative element naɖem after the verb,
like it happens in simple negative sentences.

"Demonstratives precede the numerals. This is illustrated in the example (5.16).

5.4.8 Genitive-noun
Jarawa exhibits possessor-possessed order. The possessive forms of pronominals
are either prefixed to the possessed nouns or stand independently before the
possessed nouns. Thus, possessive pronominals always come before the noun. In
example (5.17), the 1st person pronominal is possessor and in example (5.18) the
word innen ‘non-Jarawa’ is possessor.

"219220Chapter 6: ConclusionThe Jarawas are a monolingual community living along the western coast of
Andaman Islands. The Jarawa people are primarily hunter-gatherers of Negrito
stock, with short stature, black skin, and frizzy hair. There is no evidence of
where they migrated from. Geneticists claim that these people were part of early
migrations of Palaeolithic colonisers of Southeast Asia (Thangaraj et al. 2003: 8693). Kasyap et al. (2004) commented that it appeared that the aboriginal
populations of Andaman Islands remained in isolation for a longer period than
any known ancient population of the world. The Jarawas came in contact with
the outside world at the end of 1998. After full contact was established at the end
of 1998, this is the first attempt to write a descriptive grammar of the language of
the Jarawas. For data elicitation, the method of participant observation was
adopted. During the initial phase, the pictorial method was also followed. In the
pictorial method, pictures of body parts, fish, animals, insects, etc. were shown to
the consultants to collect the data related to these pictures. Natural conversations
among participants were noted down. Since the community is monolingual,
learning the language of the participants was inevitable. The data collected in the
span of four years has been the only source for writing the present thesis.
Based on the initial description, the data was further investigated in order to
place Jarawa in the typological framework provided by Greenberg (1963) and
later supplemented by Hawkins (1984) and Dryer (2007).
In segmental phonology, the sound inventory, syllabic structure, and
phonological phenomena of the language were described. The discussion also
220221included problems associated with the identification and establishment of
sounds as phonemes. In order to establish the phonemic status of a particular
sound, four methodological principles were adopted. These principles were
phonological contrast, variability among sounds, distribution of sounds and
statistical criterion.
The sound inventory contains 41 sounds, out of which 28 are consonants and 13
are vowels. The vowel system was classified into two groups based on
qualitative contrasts and quantitative difference. In qualitative difference, threeway distinction in height, three-way distinction in tongue position, and two-way
distinction in the position of lips were found. One high-mid central unrounded
vowel /ᵼ/ was also attested. Length was found to be phonemic except for the
high-mid central unrounded vowel. In the consonant category, voiceless and
voiced plosives and voiced nasals were attested. These plosives and nasals were
classified based on five places of articulation, namely bilabial, dental, retroflex,
palatal, and velar. The aspirated counterparts of these plosives were also found
(except bilabial). In the consonantal group, trill, flap, lateral sounds were also
found. Two approximants, bilabial and palatal, were also attested. Bilabial
fricative and pharyngeal fricative were also found, though this study could not
establish bilabial fricative as a phoneme. Two labialised sounds, namely voiceless
aspirated velar plosive and voiceless pharyngeal fricative, were also found.
The thesis also investigates the distribution of sounds at syllable level and word
level. Most of the consonants are found both syllable-initially and -finally, but
the sounds /ʈʰ, č, čʰ, ǰ, ɲ, r, hʷ/ are not found syllable finally. Vowels were not
taken into consideration at syllable level because vowels form the nucleus of a
syllable whether it is initially or finally. At the word level short vowels were
221222found to occur at initial, medial and final position while long vowels were found
to occur only initially and medially.
Syllable structure was also investigated, and it was found that the syllable in
Jarawa has a nucleus with optional onset and optional coda; the language attests
all four variants of minimal possible syllable structures: V, CV, VC and CVC. It
was also found that the language allows only one consonant in onset position
and one consonant in coda position. Words in Jarawa were found to be
monosyllabic, disyllabic or polysyllabic.
In phonological processes, the use of mi forms and ma forms was discussed.
Jarawa demonstrates the use of reduced forms in possessive constructions which
are compound words consisting of a possessive prefix and an independent root.
The first syllable of the independent root gets truncated and the reduced form is
attached to the possessive prefix.
In the morphology it was found that this language is agglutinating in nature, and
employs simple morphology in terms of affixation. There were a few prefixes
and suffixes. In the prefix category, there were pronominals and the
referential/definiteness marker whereas in the suffix category, were mood,
modality or evidential marking with verbs, plural marking with nouns, and
state/evidential marking with adjectives. Six word classes were found: noun,
pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, and postposition.
Two kinds of roots were attested: free root and bound root. Three kinds of
prefixes were confirmed, which were possessive prefixes, pronominals, and the
referential/definiteness marker. In the suffix category negative suffix, evidential222223marker, mood/modality marking, state/evidential marking, plural marking,
denominalisation suffix were attested.
Two kinds of Noun Phrases (NPs) were found: nominal headed NPs and
pronominal headed NPs.
Pronominals are divided into three persons: first person, second person and third
person. Plural counterparts of these were not found. Morphologically,
pronominals were found to behave differently from nouns. Pronominals attach
to nouns as possessive prefixes, adjectives as subjects of complement clauses, and
to verbs as subjects of intransitive verbs or objects of transitive verbs. Two forms
of pronominals are also attested. These two forms were the “mi” form and the
“ma” form. Phonologically these forms demonstrated vowel harmony in the case
of the possessive prefix. When the possessive prefixes are used as independent
words, “mi” form is used. In syntax the “mi” form was found to be used as
subject whereas the “ma” form was used as object. Though the morphological
behaviour of pronominals indicated that they could possibly be considered as a
clitic, in this study this phenomenon is left for further research.
Two kinds of demonstrative pronouns, proximate li and distant luwə, are
attested. onne ‘who’, onəhə ‘what’, kahaje ‘where’, ʈʰučəgə ‘where’, nojčʰe ‘how
many/much’ were observed as interrogative pronouns.
Nouns were classified into Class I (bound roots) and Class II (free roots). Class II
were further classified semantically into celestial bodies, cultural artifacts, and
flora and fauna.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"

This dissertation aims to present a descriptive grammar of the Jarawa language.
Sound system, morphology and syntax of the language have been examined and
analyzed to arrive at conclusion. This study also makes an attempt to classify the
language typologically. According to Radcliff-Brown (1948), the word ‘Jarawa’
has been derived from the Aka-Bea language of the Great Andamanese group,
which meant ‘stranger’ ‘or someone who should be afraid of’. The people who
speak Jarawa belong to a hunter-gatherer community living along the western
coast of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, a part of Union Territory of India. The
term ‘Jarawa’ is used for both the language and the people/community, although
Jarawas call themselves əŋ1.
The Andaman Islands have been the home for indigenous communities
comprising of Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarawa and Sentinelese (see §1.4 for
detailed discussion). All these communities represent ‘the first Palaeolithic
colonizers of South-East Asia’ (Thangaraj et al, 2003) and ‘remained in isolation
for a longer period than any known population of the world’ (Kashyap et al,
2004). The archaeological evidence for an early occupation of Andamans is scant
because of the nomadic lifestyle of the inhabitants and the limited number of
explorations that have taken place. At present, the oldest confirmed radio-carbon1Instead of using the term əŋ for this community, I will make use of the term ‘Jarawa’ throughoutthe dissertation, because this community and their language are known worldwide by this term
for centuries. Changing the term may create confusion among readers.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"4.7 Interrogative clauses
Interrogatives in Jarawa are of two types: ‘yes/no’ questions and wh-questions.
In first type, the interrogative marker ka is used at the beginning of the sentence,
while in the second type question words (interrogative pronouns) are used to
create the interrogative. However, there are some instances where the
interrogative marker is used even in wh-questions. All these structures are
described in the following sub-sections.
4.7.1Yes/no questionsThe schema of a yes/no question is presented in (4.81).
(4.81) ka + [subject]NP + {[object]NP} + Verb]]VP ?
In (4.81), object has been put within the curly bracket (to show optionality) since
intransitive verbs do not take an object. However, instead of an object some
peripheral arguments like a spatial NP may come between the subject NP and
the verb.",[188]
"Jarawa is a non-tonal language. It employs a seven-vowel system with a threeway distinction in height and a two-way distinction in the horizontal position of
the raised part of the tongue. Thus, this language has /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, /u/, /ə/ and
/ᵼ/. This seven-vowel system also has contrast in length.
The consonant system in this language contains plosives in abundance, followed
by nasals. Plosives demonstrate a five-way distinction in place {bilabial, dental,
retroflex, palatal and velar} and two-way distinction of voicing. Thus, the
language has /p, b/, /t, d/, /ʈ, ɖ /č, ǰ/ and /k, g/. Aspiration is also distinctive in
voiceless plosives except /p/. Two fricatives {voiceless bilabial and pharyngeal}199200are also attested. Two approximants, bilabial and palatal, with a trill, a tap, and a
lateral are also present. No voiced consonant has aspiration at all. Labialisation is
not common in this language but one labialised pharyngeal fricative and one
labialised aspirated voiceless velar plosive are also found.
Jarawa has a (C)V(C) syllable structure with no consonant cluster either in initial
position or in final position. In this language the common phonological structure
of words is CV.CV. However, other kinds of phonological structures of words
like CVC.CV are also attested.
5.3 Morphological typology of Jarawa
5.3.1 Root and Affixes
This language exhibits a two-way classification of roots: free roots and bound
roots. Bound roots are human-specific, consisting of human body parts, kinship
terms and some verbs which are used only for humans; free roots are used for
other than non-humans.
Affixes fall into two categories, prefixes and suffixes. Possessive pronouns,
pronouns, definiteness/referential marker, and causative elements can occur as
prefixes. Plural marking, verbaliser, mood, modality and evidentiality marker
are used as suffixes. Sometimes the copula is also prefixed to adjectives. Among
the prefixes, only the causative prefix falls under affixes since other elements like
possessive prefix, definiteness/referentiality marker and pronouns can occur
independently in syntax. In the derivational category the causative element
occurs as a prefix whereas the verbaliser element (the affix which changes a noun
into a verb) is suffixed. Plural markings on nouns, and mood, modality and
evidentiality markers on verbs fall under inflection category.
2002015.3.2 Noun morphology
Jarawa employs a three-way classification of nouns: human body parts, kinship
terms, and other nouns. The human body parts and kinship terms are bound
roots whereas other nouns are free roots. Human body parts obligatorily take
definite possessive prefix or indefinite human generific possessive prefixes while
kinship terms carry only the definite possessive prefix obligatorily. In example
(5.1) oɖə ‘hair’ cannot occur as a free root if it refers to human hair; it must take a
possessive prefix which may be the indefinite human generic possessive prefix
ən- as in (5.1), or the definite possessive prefix like in (5.2). Similarly, awela
‘brother-in-law’ never occurs independently; it must occur with a definite
possessive prefix like in (5.3). Other nouns like napo ‘fish’, noha ‘bird’ čaɖɖa ‘hut’
occur as free roots. These nouns take a possessive prefix only when semantics
requires it.
(5.1) ən-oɖə
POSS[HUMAN]-hairhuman hair(5.2). m-oɖə
1POSS-hair
my hair(5.3)m-awela
1POSS-brother-in-law
my brother-in-law (wife’s brother)201202Countable nouns are divided into two, singular and plural. Singular nouns bear
zero affixation while plural nouns take plural suffix /-le/, though plural marking
is not obligatory. Nouns do not bear grammatical gender markings. No syntactic
case marking is carried on nouns, i.e. subject, direct object and indirect object
have zero case marking. This language has definiteness/referential marking on
direct object and indirect object, which differentiates subject and object of a
clause. The language makes use of semantic case marking for location, temporal
and spatial nouns.
5.3.3 Pronominal system
Jarawa employs a three-way classification of personal pronouns based on person.
There are three persons: first person, second person, and third person. For third
person pronoun Jarawa also makes use of demonstrative pronouns. There is no
number and gender distinction in the pronominal system, neither in personal
pronouns, nor in demonstratives. Like nouns, pronouns also do not bear any
kind of case marking. One of the characteristic features of personal pronouns in
Jarawa is that they can be prefixed to nouns, adjectives, and verbs (in the case of
verbs, to only those beginning with a vowel, and with no other element
intervening between the verb and personal pronoun.
5.3.4 Adjective class
Adjectives can be divided into two broad categories: pure/descriptive adjectives
form one group and demonstratives and numerals constitute another group. The
division of adjectives is based on the use of adjectives in syntactic constructions.
Pure adjectives follow nouns while demonstratives and numerals precede nouns.
Pure adjectives consist of words related to dimension, age, colour, and value.","[217, 218, 219, 220]"
"12date is just >2000 years old and there are no artefacts to suggest contact or trade
with the world outside the archipelago (Cooper 1993). Native islanders’
relationship with Palaeolithic colonizers and their isolation from outside world
for longer times have been the subject of interest and inquisition of scientists,
anthropologists, archaeologists, human evolutionists and linguists for centuries.
Though, the focus of the present study is the Jarawa language and people using
this language, it will be difficult to understand this community in isolation; the
reason being that the different communities of the islands have witnessed
conflict and contact with the outside world at different stages of history which
had affected all of them individually and collectively in varying ways. Thus, in
order to understand Jarawa, their habitat, and their plight in the course of
history, it is necessary to explore the geography of the islands and examine the
historical stages of the region with special reference to all the indigenous
communities of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
The present chapter concentrates on a brief discussion of the islands, its history,
and native population. Section 1.1 presents a geographical description of the
islands. Section 1.2 discusses the demography of the Islands with reference to
Non-Autochthons (non-indigenous) population of the islands. The history of the
islands is discussed in Section 1.3. Section 1.4 presents a brief introduction of the
natives of the islands. Section 1.5 focuses on Jarawa, their physical characteristics,
social structure and customs, as well as tools and artefacts used by Jarawas.
Review of literature is provided in Section 1.6. Section 1.7 depicts the
methodology adopted for fieldwork in the Andaman Islands. The organization of
this dissertation is discussed in Section 1.8.","[19, 20]"
"In example (4.109) below, itʰəgə ‘cut’ is a transitive verb, so it takes an object NP;
this object NP takes definiteness marker ɖi. This entire verb phrase can be
considered as a clause, although the example in (4.109) differs from (4.107). In
(4.107) both the verbs take the evidentiality suffix whereas in (4.109) only the
main verb takes the evidential suffix. However, the absence of the suffix in
(4.109) does not pose any problem to the analysis of the clause, instead the verb
178179in (4.109) bəᵼʈʰe which is intransitive. In intransitive constructions, the subject NP
takes ɖi if headed by a noun; if headed by a pronoun, it does not take ɖi. ɖi
always follows the NP it refers to. Thus, the ɖi in (4.109) does not refer to the
subject NP; for the subject NP is headed by a pronoun, and it is too far away
from the subject NP (see § 4.9 for conditions for the use of ɖi). Here it means
refers to the dependent clause, or what we can call the clause internal
complement clause.(4.109) taŋɖ-itʰəgəɖ-əᵼʈʰe-jə (ɖi-bəᵼʈʰe-jə)treeREF-cutREF-go-VEVDI will go for cutting wood.","[196, 197]"
"3.3.3.2 Alienable
Nouns other than body parts and kinship terms are alienable nouns in Jarawa.
Possession of an alienable noun is expressed by prefixing a possessive pronoun,
as shown in (3.35–3.37).(3.35) mičaɖɖa1POSS hut

Phrase which may include demonstratives, numerals, adjectives, and other kinds
of nominal modifiers.
3.3.4.1 Basic Noun Phrase
The noun phrase in Jarawa consists of a noun and optional modifiers like
genitives, numerals, descriptive adjectives, and adverbs. Numerals and genitives
precede the noun while descriptive adjectives follow the nouns. Adverbs follow
the adjectives. The schema of a noun phrase is presented in (3.39) and illustrated
in (3.40).

In this construction, mi functions as possessor which is also used as a possessive
marker, so {mi} serves for both possessor and possessive prefix. But if the
possessor and the possessed are both nominals, the possessive prefix will get
attached to the possessed noun and the order of noun phrase will be as
illustrated in (3.41).

"The sentence (3.99) can also mean only the phrase ‘these arrows’. It is difficult to
syntactically assess whether (3.99) is a clause or a phrase. If this phrase is
employed as a subject or an object of a clause, then it can be interpreted as a
demonstrative adjective. For instance, in example (3.100), luwə paʈʰo-le ‘those
125126arrows’ is an example of a demonstrative adjective as this entire noun phrase is
used as an object of the clause.
(3.100)luwəpaʈʰo-leDEM-Aarrow-PLɖ-eŋge
REF-bringBring those arrows.
3.5.3Degree of adjectivesJarawa differentiates between degrees of comparison. The language displays
positive, comparative, and superlative degrees. The degree of comparison is not
expressed morphologically. Rather, syntactic strategies are employed to express
degree of comparison. Positive degree is formed by using noun and adjective,
illustrated by (3.101).","[143, 144]"
"3233The structured method was adopted only in restricted cases. There are two
things to be noted in this regard: the structured method was adopted while
pictorial method was employed, i.e. collecting data with the help of pictures; and
there was an attempt to verify the data.
1.7.2.3.2. Systematic observation
Participant observation
In order to collect linguistic data in a monolingual community, participant
observation is one of the significant methods. This method not only allowed me
to observe the way they speak, but also provided me an opportunity to know
how they perform other activities. It also helped me note down the conversation,
and its context. Moreover, it helped consultants get rid of their hesitation in the
presence of an outsider, since Ibecame a part of their daily lives. This provided
me the opportunities to learn many things about their social and cultural norms
without disturbing them. Throughout my fieldwork in the Andamans, I adopted
participant observation method along with other methods which are described in
§ 1.7.4.
1.7.2.4 Field Procedures
I followed different techniques to collect data in the field. These techniques
included pictorial method, showing objects to them to know the name of those
objects; listening to their conversations, and recording those conversations. In the
initial phase, carefully listening to their conversations, recording pieces of
conversations, and listening to those conversations back home where I used to
stay were the major steps I took. This helped me accustom my ear to the sound
system of the language. Meanwhile, I started collecting data with help of pictures
3334related to body-parts, birds, animals, fish etc. It was followed by noting words by
pointing to objects that were lying around. I also attempted to list words related
to daily activities such as run, walk, sleep, eat, drink etc. by pointing to these
activities if somebody was enacting them. Moreover, I kept noting down simple
sentences which I could understand (after collecting some data). I also noted the
contexts of sentences/conversations. As time passed I picked up the language
and tried to speak small phrases. This gave me an opportunity to learn, converse,
and collect further data on the language.
1.7.3 Limitations of the study
Despite all the efforts made by me to elicit maximum amount of, there were
limitations to this study. Firstly, there was a very limited amount of time
available to be in contact with the community. As mentioned earlier, the
condition that AAJVS staff must be present at all times caused a severe
restriction of contact between the researcher and the consultants. Secondly,
whenever the group of Jarawas stayed far away from the road side along the sea
shore, contact with Jarawas depended on the short visits made available with
AAJVS staff. It is true that I was totally dependent on the mercy of the AAJVS
staff. Thirdly, it had, always, been a problem and challenge to obtain data from a
monolingual community to write a descriptive grammar. I am aware that there is
a lot of grammatical information which may have escaped my attention. Readers
will also agree with me that it is not possible to unearth each and every
grammatical information of the language in a limited time period. Hence, this
work is a modest attempt to present a descriptive grammar of the Jarawa
language from a typological point of view based on the data I could elicit from
my consultants during the period of my stay at Great Andaman.","[50, 51, 52]"
"3.4.6Function of prefixesThere are three types of prefixes generally attached to verbs. One is the
pronominal, which, when attached to a verb as prefix, has two different
functions: (a) subject of intransitive verb or object of transitive verb, or (b) coreferencing element. Only third person pronouns can be used as co-referencing
elements. These two different functions of pronominals are described here as two
different prefixes.",[134]
"116117Another element which can be prefixed to a verb is referential/definiteness
marker. Usually part of a noun phrase (S or O argument of a clause), it can attach
to a verb as a prefix when there is no intervening element between the
referentiality marker and the verb.
3.4.6.1 Pronominals
Pronominals in Jarawa are more likely to be prefixed to verbs that start with a
vowel. Subject pronominals attach to an intransitive verb while object
pronominals attach to a transitive verb. If the verb is ditransitive, neither subject
nor indirect object pronominals attach to the verb. The nature and distribution of
these pronominals have been discussed in detail in § 3.3.1.1. Therefore, in this
section we will concentrate only on the use of the definiteness/referential marker
and co-referencing marker.
3.4.6.2 Referential/definiteness marker {ɖi-}
It seems that there are different functions of {ɖi-}. Sometimes it denotes
referentiality and sometimes definiteness. Though referentiality and definiteness
are similar concepts, I discuss separately, to distinguish between references made
to the visual (within sight of speaker-hearer), and non-visual (indefinite object;
its reference is derived from the preceding context). The former uses the
referential marker and the latter the definiteness marker. For instance, in (3.78),
iŋ ‘water’ refers to water within sight of the speaker-hearer.","[134, 135]"
"228229To express negation, this language makes use of an independent word naɖem
after a predicate (verbal or verbless), or a suffix -ma on a verb. There was no
semantic difference observed between the two. We saw that the independent
word naɖem could be used across the board while the suffix -ma had restricted
use.
Imperatives are formed by using the verb with its core argument. As we saw,
there is no morphological marking to differentiate imperatives from other kinds
of sentences.
In interrogatives, we looked at yes/no questions and wh-questions, which differ
syntactically. Yes/no questions are formed by placing the interrogative marker ka
at the beginning of a clause, while in wh-questions the wh-word occupied its situ
position. The use of the interrogative marker with some wh-questions was also
found.
In the category of complex sentences, I explored coordination and complement
clauses. A conjunction ən ‘and’ was found to be used to express coordination. In
coordinated clauses, it was found that conjunction ən ‘and’ can be employed at
phrase level and clausal level to form coordinated clauses.
Two different kinds of complement clauses were also discussed. These two types
of clauses were clause internal and clause external complement clauses. In a
clause internal complement clause, the complement clause occurs within the
main clause in the object position of the verb phrase. Clause external
complement clauses were described as instances of direct speech in this
language. Since the language was found to be SOV, meaning the object occupies229230the slot before verb, these kinds of constructions were considered as clause
external complement clauses.
Direct speech and cleft constructions were established as types of complex
constructions found in Jarawa. It was suggested that there is only direct speech
in this language (based on pronominal correlation). Cleft constructions were
found to have two sub-types: ɖi-constructions and ʈʰi-constructions. The former
suggests referential/definiteness of the entity referred to, and the latter
indefiniteness of the entity referred to.
The morpheme ɖi was shown to have two different usages in this language. One
usage is to indicate definiteness/referentiality, and the second is to express
grammatical relation. Referentiality was treated in this dissertation as applicable
when the entity referred to is within sight of the speaker-hearer. Definiteness,
then, is applicable when the entity referred to is not within sight but the speakerhearer has shared knowledge. . However, some restrictions were found on the
use of this morpheme. It never occurs with pronominals and postposed Os. It can
occur only with lexically headed S or O arguments of a clause. This morpheme
was also seen employed with interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’ and clause
internal complement clauses. In the case of the interrogative pronoun onne ‘who’,
the cleft construction is formed.
The way this morpheme is employed in this language also indicated that this
morpheme expressed grammatical relations, i.e. ergative-absolutive system. The
languageemployssplitergative-absolutivesystem.","[246, 247, 248]"
"4Though this symbol represents high central unrounded vowel in IPA, I have used this symbolfor high-mid central unrounded vowel in order to avoid confusion with schwa.",[58]
"224225Two kinds of causative constructions, morphological and syntactic, were found.
Morphological causatives are formed by prefixing causative prefix {wa-} to verbs.
Limited data suggested that morphological causative is employed to a handful of
verbs, and the syntactic causative across the board. In syntactic causatives, the
independent word is used to express causation along with the lexical verb.
In the adjective category, this language was observed to demonstrate descriptive
adjectives, numerals, and demonstratives. Descriptive adjectives consist of words
related to colour terms or which define, describe, and qualify nouns. Also found
was marking of the degree of adjectives. In degrees of comparison positive,
comparative, and superlative degrees are attested. The positive degree is formed
by the noun phrase and adjective. The comparative degree was seen to be
expressed syntactically. In the comparative degree, the standard of comparison
was observed to precede the marker of comparison, and the adjective to follow
the marker of comparison. Superlative degree was seen as formed by employing
the intensifier or a completely new word which was not found to have any
resemblance with the adjective of positive degree.
Adverb was also found as a separate word class. These are lexical items used as
intensifiers, temporal adverbs, and spatial adverbs. No morphological
derivational process was confirmed to form adverbs from adjectives.
No syntactic case marking was observed in this language. However, two
morphemes were attested as postpositions to express semantic case. These
morphemes were {ɖə} and {ɲačʰe}. The morpheme {ɖə} has multiple functions in
this language. This morpheme was found to express place of location, source of
location, and goal of location. It was also frequently found with temporal and225226spatial adverbs, but not always. The morpheme {ɲačʰe} expresses the
commitative.
The morpheme {ʈʰi} was identified as copula. This copula is used to identify an
entity or qualify a noun. It was also seen employed with negative particles and
with temporal and spatial adverbs in short responses. Sometimes this morpheme
was also seen with verbs which were performing the function of adverbs. The
corpus suggested that this copula does not take inflection, but one example was
found where it was inflected for mood.
Four word formation processes were confirmed. These word formation processes
were compounding, denominalisation, reduplication, and the use of empty
morpheme. In compounding, three combinations were substantiated: nounnoun, noun-adjective, and noun-noun-adjective. In the denominalisation process,
we saw that nouns are denominalised to verbs with the help of a suffix. In
reduplication,Jarawademonstratessyllablereduplicationandwordreduplication. As for word reduplication, the corpus suggested that verbs were
reduplicated to serve the function of adverbial modifiers.
A notable phenomenon was also observed under word formation processes: a
morpheme used mostly with personal nouns (but also other nouns) was
discussed, but the meaning of this morpheme was not clear. Hence this
morpheme was referred to as an empty morpheme.
In syntax, the different syntactic structures of Jarawa, and their variances were
discussed. These syntactic structures included simple clause structures,
interrogative constructions, imperative sentences, negative constructions, and226227cleft constructions. It was also observed that this language follows the ergativeabsolutive system.
In declarative sentences, verbless and verbal clauses were discussed. Verbless
clauses consisted of non-verbal predicates like nouns and adjectives as the heads
of clauses. Copula constructions were also included in verbless clauses. Verbal
clauses contained verbs as heads of main clauses.
In verbless clauses we encountered two different types of clauses: one type had a
nominal as the head of the predicate, and another had an adjective as the head of
the clause. Verbless clauses also included copula constructions, since the use of
copula constructions were mostly observed in this type. In verbless clauses with
a nominal as head, two constructions were discussed: one where the S argument
was a pronominal headed NP and another where it was a lexically headed NP.
Lexical NPs were found to take copula constructions while pronominal headed
NPs never take copula constructions.
In verbless clauses with adjectival predicates, three kinds of constructions were
discussed. One was with prefixation of a pronominal S argument in adjectival
predicates beginning with a vowel, and which never takes a copula. The second
was copula constructions with a lexically headed NP as S argument which take a
copula. The third was adjectival predicates suffixed for state/evidentiality, which
also do not take the copula.
In verbal clauses there were four kinds of constructions discussed. These were
intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and constructions with denominalised verbs.
All these constructions were found to have different structures.","[242, 243, 244, 245]"
"227228We saw that in intransitive clauses with pronominal headed NP as the S
argument, the NP can be prefixed to the verb (if the verb starts with a vowel).
This is not allowed with a lexically headed NP. However, the lexically headed
NP, if specific, takes the referential/definiteness marker in intransitive clauses.
Apart from these intransitive constructions, we encountered denominalised
constructions. These were posited to include (purely intransitive) weather type
constructions, and another type of construction, which semantically appeared to
be transitive but, behaved as if they were intransitive clauses.
Transitive clauses were considered as a separate group, with a transitive verb as
the head of the predicate. In such constructions two core arguments were
confirmed. These core arguments are A(gent) and O(bject). In these constructions
A precedes O and O precedes the verb. If the O argument is a pronominal
headed NP, it generally attaches to the verb if the verb begins with a vowel. In
the case of a lexically headed NP, we had observed the insertion of the
referential/definiteness marker after it. This referential/definiteness marker was
seen to alway move with the D(irect) O(bject).
In ditrasitive clauses, the position of A and the verb was found to be fixed in
declarative sentences, i.e. A always occurs at the beginning of the clause, and the
verb at the end of clause. The order of I(ndirect) O(bject) and DO might change.
The referential/definiteness marker is used to specify the DO, hence this marker
moves along with it. However, IO may also take referential/definiteness marker.
Apart from the core arguments, peripheral arguments of the clause were shown
to have different positions in the clause. Temporal adverbs generally occur at the
beginning while spatial adverbs/nouns just before the verb.","[245, 246]"
"4.8.2ComplementationIn this section we will discuss two kinds of complement clauses: clause internal
complement clauses and clause external complement clauses. The first type
occurs within a clause, in the object position within the VP. Jarawa is an SOV
language and therefore any clause that fills the object position should precede
the verb. However, it is possible to have a complement clause which follows the
verb as well. This type of clause is clause external complement clauses. Direct or
indirect speech is included in the clause external complement clause.
4.8.2.1 Complement internal clauses
It is difficult to ascertain if Jarawa has clause internal complement clauses
because it is not evident whether these types of clauses are NPs or complement
177178clauses. I will make an attempt to uncover whether these types of constructions
are complement clauses or complement nominalisations. Examples like (4.107)
suggest both these possibilities.
(4.107) miujijəɖ-ipale-jəɖibəᵼʈʰe-jə1fishREF-fish[V]-VEVDREFgo-VEVDI will go for fishing.(4.108) [mii] [øi]A [ujijə]NP [ɖ-ipale-jə]]]VP]NP [ɖi] [bəᵼʈʰe-jə]]]]VPTwo verb phrases are employed here, a main verb phrase and a dependent verb
phrase. Semantically both the verbs carry their lexical meaning, and they follow
the syntactic rules of a simple clause.
Here there are two clauses: (1) [mi]NP [ujijə]NP [ɖ-ipale-jə]]VP ‘we will do fishing’
and (2) [mi]NP [ɖi [bəᵼʈʰe-jə]VP ‘ we will go’. In (1), the verb is ipale ‘fish[V]’ and in (2)
the verb is bəᵼʈʰe ‘go[V]’. ipale is a transitive verb; thus it takes NP ujiyə ‘a kind of
fish’ as an object NP. This results in the use of the referential marker ɖi with the
object ujiyə. mi ‘first person pronoun’ serves as a subject for both the clauses.","[195, 196]"
"5.4.2 Peripheral arguments
Like other SOV languages, Jarawa places peripheral arguments and/or
adpositional phrases before the verb. The peripheral arguments and/or
adpositional phrases are not syntactic arguments of a verb, but demonstrate the
same pattern as object and verb. The precise positions these arguments occupy in
205206syntactic structures could vary. In intransitive clauses these arguments will just
precede the verb while in transitive clauses they may occur before the object. The
example in (5.8) illustrates the use of a peripheral argument of an intransitive
verb, where the peripheral argument olleg ‘place name’ precedes the verb as
object. Example (5.9) shows the position of the peripheral argument olleg ‘place
name’ which precedes the object, and therefore precedes the verb.
(5.8)tenmejollegɖəbəᵼʈʰeTenmeyOllegLOCgoTenmey will go to Olleg/Lakralunda.","[223, 224]"

you stay there?
There are some cases where the interrogative marker ka is employed in this type
of wh-question, as shown in (4.100). It was not ascertained why ka appears in
such cases. The ordering of the interrogative marker and other constituents of the
clause is as we have in other interrogative constructions, where we have
interrogative marker in the beginning of the clause followed by other
constituents.

INTM-2kahiunenonəhəɖih-ija-g?morningwhatREF3-give-PSTWhat did you give in the morning?
Some constructions involve the structure SUB + INTM + question word. These
constructions mostly contain the subject NP and the question word for ‘where’.
For example, in the sentence (4.102) there is a subject NP čajwaj and question
word ʈʰučəʈəgə, consequently we have ‘cajwaj ka ʈʰučəʈəgə’175176(4.102) čajwaj
CaywaykaʈʰučəʈəgəINTMwhereWhere is Cayway?
This sentence can also be formed without ka:
ʈʰučəʈəgə(4.103) čajwajCayway where
Where is Cayway?
Putting the interrogative marker ka at the beginning of the sentence causes
ungrammaticality. For example:
(4.104) * ka
INTMčajwajʈʰučəʈəgəPNwhereWhere is Cayway?
4.8 Complex sentences
The present corpus shows evidence of coordination, and of direct and indirect
speech. There is no substantial evidence for complex sentences involving
subordination. Distinguishing between direct and indirect speech is difficult
since no complementiser or any particle is used in such constructions.","[192, 193, 194]"
"36372.1Sounds and PhonemesIn this section I discuss different techniques that were employed in establishing
whether a particular sound is a phoneme in this language. I also present the
methodological principles adopted.
The sound inventory of Jarawa contains 41 sounds, of which 28 are consonants
and 13 are vowels. However, it is difficult to claim that all the sounds are
phonemes in this language, for it is difficult to provide minimal pairs for every
pair of sounds in order to establish the phonemic status of a particular sound.
Even so, I have made an attempt to provide minimal pairs wherever the corpus
contains such data. The main problem in researching the sound system of Jarawa
is that we are not able to claim with authority that a particular sound is a
phoneme in this language, because the language demonstrates considerable
variation. Since there is a lot of variation at the level of sounds, it is pertinent to
discuss this aspect first. There are instances where two pairs of sounds, for
example /p/ and /b/ can be used interchangeably in the words like bəᵼʈʰe ‘go’. The
word bəᵼʈʰe can be pronounced as pəᵼʈʰe. Since we have minimal pairs which
demonstrate that these two sounds are phonemes in this language, we may
deduce that in such words they are in free variation. But in the case of palatal
plosives /č/ and /ǰ/ it becomes hard to decide whether they are phonemes or they
are allophones of the phone /č/ since we lack minimal pairs.
We can deduce from the preceding observation that whether a sound is a
phoneme or allophone is not always distinct. This difficulty arose during
research mainly due to lack of minimal pairs for each pair of sounds. Further,
those pairs of sounds which have minimal pairs also demonstrate some variation
3738in the words. In order to assert a conclusive result in such circumstances we
needed to enquire the phonological knowledge of speakers. Phonological
knowledge of speakers contains the phonological contrast which amounts to
minimal pairs. However, when a community is monolingual, it becomes difficult
to decipher every aspect of phonological contrast for each phoneme. In this
context it is important to state the methodological principles adopted to identify
phonemes. Four methodological principles were employed to state the phonemic
status of a sound in this language.
1. Phonological contrast: This highlights whether the particular sound is
contrastive in nature by looking at minimal pairs. There are some pairs of
sounds which have minimal pairs.
2. Variability among sounds: If there is no minimal pair for a pair of sounds,
an attempt was made to find out if there is any variability between the
sounds; and, if it exists, what the contexts of occurrences are for those
sounds in the language. If there is any variability and if it is difficult to
claim the phonemic status of the sounds, I have adopted pattern congruity
as the method to support the claim; for example in the case of the sounds
/č/ and /ǰ/.
3. Distribution of sounds: I have also made an attempt to investigate the
distribution of sounds at syllable level and word level. Examining the
occurrences of sounds at different levels assists in determining whether
the variability of the sounds is due to some kind of conditioning
(phonological or lexical) or it is an idiolectal variation.
4. Statistical criterion: Since some pairs of sounds show alternation among
themselves, it becomes difficult to infer which sound has the actual
representation in the words. To determine the actual representation of
3839sounds in words, I have adopted a statistical criterion where the
frequencies of occurrences of two sounds are evaluated.That is, if one
sound is used more frequently in a word than the other, the former is
considered to be the phoneme, and latter an idiolectal variation. This
criterion is employed if there is no viability of having definite sets of rules
which apply to a set of data to claim the allophonic status of certain
sounds.
2.2Phonemic ContrastsIn this section, I will attempt to provide minimal pairs to establish the phonemic
status of vocalic and consonantal sounds wherever it is possible.
Vowels in this language can be classed in three groups: two front vowels, two
back vowels and three central vowels. The front vowels are [i] and [e], back
vowels [u] and [o], while the central vowels are [ᵼ], [ə] and [a]. There are also two
mid-low vowels, [ɛ], and [ɔ], but their phonemic status is not clear. Their
occurrences in the data of our corpus are limited, and I could not obtain any
minimal pairs. Length is also phonemic in this language; hence we have short
and long vowels. However, no length distinction was found in the case of the
high-mid central unrounded vowel. Thus we have 13 vowels. Some nasalized
vowels were also found, but their phonemic status can not be established in the
present work.
Among the 28 consonants, there are voiced and voiceless plosives along with
voiceless aspirated plosives. Sounds like nasals, trill and retroflex flap, lateral
and retroflex lateral also occur in this language. There are two approximants,
labial and palatal. There are also a few fricatives like pharyngeal fricative, and
3940bilabial fricative. Two labialised consonants exist, pharyngeal fricative, and
voiceless aspirated velar plosive.
2.2.1VowelsJarawa exhibits the basic seven vowel system which is illustrated in table 2.1.
Table 2.1: Jarawa vowel phonemes
Front
HighiHigh-mid
Mid
LowCentralBack
uᵼ
eəoaThis basic seven vowel system can further be categorized into two groups: one
which has qualitative contrasts in itself and another which contains quantitative
differences. In qualitative difference, Jarawa employs three way distinctions in
the height: high, mid, and low; three way distinction of tongue position: front,
central, and back; and two way distinction in the position of lips: rounded and
unrounded. There is one vowel which may be categorized as a high-mid central
unrounded vowel [ᵼ]4. The minimal pairs and sub-minimal pairs are given in the
next section to demonstrate their phonemic contrasts.","[54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"1571584.3.3Transitive clausesTransitive clauses are headed by transitive verbal predicates and have two core
arguments, A and O. In such clauses, A precedes the O, and O precedes the verb.
The structures of transitive clauses vary according to the object NP: it will have a
different structure if the object NP is headed by a noun, or headed by a
pronominal. The verbal predicates can bear different prefixes based on the object
NP. If the object NP is headed by a definite noun or indefinite but specific it will
take referential marker ɖi. If it refers to an indefinite noun, it will take prefix {h-}.
If a pronoun heads an object NP, there will be neither referential marker ɖi nor
prefix {h-} on the verb; rather, the pronoun may be prefixed to the verb. The
structure of a transitive clause is below (4.38) and illustrated by (4.39).

If the object of a transitive clause is a pronominal and the transitive verb starts
with a vowel, the object pronominal is generally prefixed to the transitive verb
(for prefix forms see § 3.3.1.1). The example (4.40) demonstrates the prefixation of
pronominals with the transitive predicates.","[175, 176]"
"Inthecaseofdefiniteness/referentiality this morpheme was usually employed with S or O. The
use of the morpheme with A was rare if S or O were found to be230231definite/referential. Thus, this morpheme conveyed grammatical relations in the
context of definiteness/referentiality. With an indefinite object this morpheme
was not employed with S, O, or A.
Typologically, this language was found to be SOV. Postpositions were found.
Descriptive adjectives and manner of adverbs follow the head while numerals
and demonstratives precede the head. In the comparative degree, the marker of
comparison follows the standard of comparison. The copula precedes non-verbal
predicates in copula constructions. Negative particles or suffixes appear at the
end of the clause.","[248, 249]"
"7980This raises the question as to whether the hypothesis that “mi” forms are subjects
and “ma” forms are objects is valid. It is also difficult to say whether it is an
idiolectal variation. In the present study there is no answer to this issue.
However, the usage of “mi” forms in object position is limited to a few instances
in the present corpus. Also, as far as “ma” forms are concerned, they can never
occur as subject of the clause. Thus, we assume in the present study that the
distinction between these forms is as hypothesised.","[97, 98]"

Jarawa lacks grammatical gender; thus there is no inflection for gender, nor is
there any gender agreement within the Noun Phrase. However, the language has
different lexical items to indicate the (natural) sex of an object. The examples in
(3.24) demonstrate the occurrence of nouns in different genders. In (3.24), the
words əŋka:w ‘old man’ and əŋka:ja:b ‘old woman’ as well as ta:hwə ‘bachelor’ and
ta:hwəja:b ‘spinster’ indicate that the form {-ja:b} represents feminine gender.

any definitive statements on the matter of gender in Jarawa.

Countable nouns in Jarawa are classified as singular and plural where singular
denotes a single entity and plural indicates more than two entities. To express
singular number, Jarawa makes use of zero marking while to denote plural, the
language employs the suffix {-le}. The examples in (3.25) and (3.26) illustrate
number marking in Jarawa.","[111, 112, 113]"
"Three properties are observed in cases when the indirect IO follows the DO: (a) ɖi
moves with the DO; in other words, ɖi comes just after the DO; (b) the verb may
take co-referencing prefix {h-} which refers to the DO (for detailed discussion, see
§ 3.4.1.1.4); and (c) if a pronominal is the IO and happens to be adjacent to verb
beginning with a vowel, this pronominal never gets prefixed to the verb.
Prefixing the IO to the ditransitive verb results in ungrammaticality of the
sentence as shown in (4.47).

The preceding chapter was a detailed study of Jarawa morphology. The present
chapter attempts to describe the syntactic structure of Jarawa: syntactic strategies
(how the language conveys commands, requests; the formation of questions, the
use of Reported Speech, and so on) and clause structure. The chapter will
elaborate these structures and their variances.
The chapter is organized in the following manner. In section 4.1, I present a brief
introduction to Jarawa clause structure. Section 4.2 discusses the verbless clause
in which a nominal or an adjective may play the role of a predicate. In section 4.3
is a detailed discussion of the verbal clause with core argument. Section 4.4
discusses verbal clauses with peripheral arguments. Section 4.5 focuses on the
negative construction, and section 4.6 describes imperative structures (includes
commands, requests, and prohibition). Section 4.7 concentrates on how
interrogative constructions are formed: it further focuses on yes/no and whquestion types. In section 4.8, complex sentences are discussed, and a close
examination of direct speech is presented. Section 4.9 attempts to depict the
function of definiteness/referential morpheme {ɖi} which seems to be used in the
ergative-absolutive system. Section 4.10 presents the conclusion of the chapter.
4.1 Clause Structure
Jarawa employs two types of clausal structures: verbless clauses where nominals
or adjectives function as head of the predicate; and verbal clauses where verbs
143144are the head of the predicate, with core arguments and/or peripheral arguments.
Both types of clauses have different morphological and syntactic structures.
Verbless clauses generally lack modality categories which are part of verbal
clauses.
Verbless clauses (nominal predicates and adjectival predicates) contain nouns or
adjectives as the head. Morphologically, adjectival predicates differ from
nominal predicates at least in terms of affixation, but cannot be classified as
verbal predicates for they combine with a marker {–g} which differentiates
adjectival predicates from nominal predicates. I have made an attempt to
investigate whether the morpheme {–g} is equivalent to the suffix {–g} which is
attached to verbal predicate. It has been observed that no other suffixes, which
can be attached to verbal predicates, can be attached to adjectival predicates. In
the case of nominal predicates there is no prefixation of S argument pronominals,
but in adjectival predicates such prefixation is possible in cases where adjectival
predicates begin with a vowel. Otherwise, adjectival predicates follow the
syntactic structure of nominal predicates.
The copula can be the head of a predicate; it takes modality suffix. Data in the
corpus, at this point, is limited to only one sentence. Thus it is difficult to
ascertain whether the copula should be considered as a predicate. Moreover, it
has another function in the syntactic structure of the language: it is sometimes
used with verbs used to indicate adverbial function (detailed discussion in § 3.8).
In this dissertation copula constructions are described under verbless clauses.
Clause structures are also defined in terms of the arguments. In verbal clauses,
the core arguments S (subject), A (agent), O (object) are defined in terms of the144145Subject of intransitive verb, Agent of transitive verb and Object of transitive verb
respectively.
4.2 Verbless clauses
The two types of verbless clauses — nominal predicates and adjectival predicates
— differ morphologically and syntactically. Nominal predicates do not bear any
morphological marking, whereas adjectival predicates can have morphological
marking.
4.2.1Nouns as head of verbless clauseWhile verbal predicates take modality and evidential categories as suffixes, and
adjectival predicates may also take a suffix (for detailed discussion see § 3.5 and
§ 4.2.2.3), nominal predicates never take such suffixes. Also, unlike verbal and
adjectival predicates, pronominals are not prefixed to S argument of nominal
predicates.
Nominal predicates have two different kinds of structures depending on whether
the S argument is a noun or a pronominal. If a pronominal is the S argument of
the nominal predicates, the clause is formed by juxtaposition, i.e. the pronominal
followed by the nominal predicate. If a noun is the S argument, the copula ʈʰi is
employed in the clause.
4.2.1.1 Pronominal as S argument of nominal predicate
Nominal predicates can have a pronominal as the S argument of the clause.
When a pronominal is the S argument of the clause, the pronominals preceding
the nominal predicates are juxtaposed. The structure of a verbless clause in the145146case of a pronominal being the S argument of a nominal predicate is given in
(4.1).
(4.1) [S]PRO[VL P]NPIt must be noted that the copula ʈʰi can never be used in such clauses.
Furthermore, the pronominal is never prefixed to the nominal predicate in such
constructions. For instance, in example (4.2), mi is the first person pronoun which
is the S argument of the nominal predicate əŋ, thus we have “mi əŋ” without
prefixing the pronoun to the predicate nominal. It seems that such distinction is
necessary to maintain since there is prefixation of the pronoun to the nouns in
possessive constructions (for detailed discussion see § 3.3.2.4).
(4.2)miəŋ1JarawaI am/we are Jarawa.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"Interestingly, the copula verb never occurs with pronominals. The examples in
(5.27) and (5.28) demonstrate that when the subject of such constructions is a
pronoun, the constructions are formed by the juxtaposing the subject and the
nominal predicate. Thus, the copula construction is possible only when the
copula subject is a nominal headed noun phrase; see examples (5.29) and (5.30).

"3.4.6.3 Co-referencing element {hi-}
The third person pronominal is employed to co-refer with a third person object
nominal of the clause. This pronominal is prefixed to the verb. It has different
allomorphs, {hi-}, {ih-}, {ihi-}, {əhi-}, and {h-}. It can also be used to refer to
indefinite objects. In the sentence (3.79), {ih-} is used as 3rd person pronoun which
refers to an object. In (3.80), {h-} is employed to co-refer with the noun iŋ ‘water’.
iŋ is here indefinite because it is not within sight. In (3.81), {h-} co-refers with the
nominal conel ‘banana’ which has moved to second position. In (3.82), there is no
{h-}, because {ɖi-} has been prefixed to the verb.",[136]
"5657/čʰʰ/ vs. /ʃʃ/
/ʃ/ is a voiceless palatal fricative while /čʰ/ is a voiceless aspirated palatal plosive.
They are in free variation in this language; /ʃ/ can always substitute the sound
/čʰ/. The examples in (2.70) and (2.71) demonstrate their variation.(2.70) /ʃɛla/name of a woman(2.71) /čʰɛla/name of a womanHere the phoneme /čʰ/ and sound /ʃ/ seem to be in allophonic distribution as they
are in free variation. However, in one word /naʃa/ ‘penis’ in my corpus , it seems
that the phoneme /ʃ/ is not substituted by /čʰ/. /čʰ/ is, moreover, a phoneme, as is
evident from examples (2.43) and (2.44), but /ʃ/ does not seem to be. Hence, /ʃ/ is
considered to be in free variation with /čʰ/ in this language./h/ vs. /hʷ/
The phoneme /h/ is voiceless pharyngeal fricative and /hʷ/ is its labialised
counterpart.
(2.72) /huʈʰu/‘big/fat’(2.73) /hʷəwə/‘wild boar’Since they cannot be substituted for each other, I will consider them as
phonemes. /h/ appears syllable-initially and syllable-finally, while /hʷ/ can only
5758occur syllable-initially. There is no evidence to say that these two sounds can be
substituted. There is also no evidence as to whether these sounds can be replaced
by any other sounds in this language.
2.2.2.4Trill, Flap and LateralsAt the sound level, Jarawa exhibits one trill, one tap, and two lateral
approximants — an alveolar lateral and a retroflex lateral. Thus, the inventory is
/r, ɽ, l, ɭ/. It is evident from examples in (2.74– 2.77) that the sounds /r, ɽ, l/ are
phonemes in this language. The occurrence of sound /ɭ/ is limited in my corpus
and I do not have evidence to claim that the sound /ɭ/ is a phoneme, nor to claim
that it is a variant of another sound, particularly /l/.

5859phonemes in this language. Moreover, we have not observed any variation
between this pair of sounds.

can occur syllable-initially, -medially, and -finally. I will also make observations
on the occurrence of sounds at the word level, that is, which sounds which can
occur word-initially, -medially, and -finally. In Jarawa, there are different
structures for the distribution of vocalic and consonantal sounds. Vowels always
form the nucleus of a syllable. Therefore, it is unnecessary to examine the
occurrences of a vowel in syllable-initial syllable-medial or syllable-final
positions. Hence, I have dealt with vocalic sounds only vis-à-vis words where
they can occur word-initially, -medially or -finally. For consonants, I have made
an attempt to examine whether they can appear as onset or coda in a syllable.
Moreover, I have also tried to see whether there is a possibility to consider their
occurrences at the word level. No consonant clusters have been found at syllable
level.
2.3.1At syllable levelSyllables in Jarawa consist of an optional onset and an optional coda. Data
suggests that Jarawa constitutes a syllable using one consonantal sound at onset5960and one at coda position. However, there are restrictions on the usage of sounds
at different levels. Hence, a word consisting of CVCV contains two syllables, CV
and CV. In the case of a word of CVCCV structure, I have considered this word
as consisting of two syllables, CVC and CV (for a detailed discussion of
syllabification, see section 2.5.
2.3.1.1ConsonantsMost of the consonants are found syllable-initially and -finally. The sounds /ʈʰ, č,
čʰ, ǰ, ɲ, r, hʷ/ are not found syllable-finally. Table 2.4 presents the occurrences of
consonants at syllable level. I have considered polysyllabic words to demonstrate
that these consonants can occur syllable-finally because there is no evidence for
the occurrence of these sounds in monosyllabic words. Wherever possible, I have
made an attempt to provide monosyllabic words.

word-finally.
2.3.2.1VowelsAt the word level there is ample evidence to claim that vowels can occur wordinitially, -medially or -finally. However, their distribution is not uniform across
these positions. Only short vowels can occur in all three positions, whereas long
vowels may occur only word-initially or-medially. I have presented the
occurrences of short and long vowel in table 2.4.

2.7MorphophonemicsIn this section I will discuss the phonological changes which occur in this
language. There are two kinds of phonological processes which will be discussed
here. Section 2.7.1 focuses on two forms of pronominals, which I have termed the
‘mi form’ and the ‘ma form’, conditioned according to how they are used. Section
2.7.2 presents a complex phenomenon which Jarawa exhibits, wherein two words
are taken together and the form of the second word is reduced. For example, mi
‘1GEN’ and paʈʰo ‘arrow’ are taken together and pronounced as /maʈʰo/ ‘my arrow’.
Here paʈʰo is only pronounced as /ʈʰo/. This phenomenon is very common in
Jarawa.
2.7.1mi vs. maThere are two forms of pronominals in each person in Jarawa. For the first person
there are /mi/ and /ma/, for second person /ŋi/ and /ŋa/ or /ni/ and /na/, and for
third person /hi/ and /hiwa/, though we have shorter forms for these pronominals
which are not taken into consideration in this section. These pronominals are
used in the positions of subject and object of a verb, and as possessive pronouns.
Throughout the dissertation I have taken /mi/, /ŋi/, and /hi/ form as ‘mi form’ and
/ma/, /ŋa/, and /hiwa/ or /wa/ as ‘ma form’. However, there is a great difference in
the usage of the mi form and the ma form in the syntax, especially in possessive6970constructions (for detailed discussion, see § 3.3.1). In the present chapter, I
enquire into whether there is any phonological reason to use mi vs. ma forms,
particularly in possessive constructions. In these constructions, for first and
second person any either form may be used, but only /wa/ is permitted for third
person. The examples in table 2.6 illustrate some of the patterns of usage of mi
and ma forms.

‘my friend’ŋi əččəle
‘your child’ŋ-itəǰile
‘your friend’wa əččəle
‘his/her child’wa-itəǰile
‘his/her friend’In the above data, there are three things that are evident. First, there is no change
in the possessive prefix of the third person; second, the mi form can attach to any
word, across the board; third, the ma form occurs with those words which have
back vowels in the first syllable of the word. The data also confirms that the ma
form is only used when there is affixation; i.e. attaching of the possessive prefix
to the possessed noun. If there is no affixation and rather, both the possessive
pronominal and the possessed noun are used as two independent words, the mi
form is generally used. Note that the environments showing vowel harmony
suggested that the process at work is, in fact, affixation.
2.7.2Reduced formsThere is a general tendency in Jarawa to reduce the form of a nominal or verb
when it is used in a possessive construction or in compound words. As
mentioned previously, /mi paʈʰo/ ‘my arrow’ can be articulated as /maʈʰo/. In
/maʈʰo/ there are two morphemes, mi ‘1GEN’ and paʈʰo ‘arrow’, where /paʈʰo/ is
reduced to /ʈʰo/ and combines with /ma/ to become /maʈʰo/. The general rule to
reduce the form is to take last syllable of the possessed noun and join it with the
5It is observed that there is no affixation of possessive prefix with əččəle ‘child’.","[74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"
"Table 3.2: ma and mi pronominal forms78Personmi formma form1st Personmima792nd Personŋi ~ ni ~ ənŋa ~ na3rd Personhi ~ əhihiwaIt is difficult to describe the exact behaviour of these two forms; at the level of
morphology (particularly possession) these forms seem to occur in free variation.
In the present study these pronominals are divided into two groups according to
their usage. At the level of syntax, there seems to be distinction: one form is used
as subject and the other form is used as object. Forms like mi, ŋi, and hi are
always used in subject position of a sentence/clause. ma, ŋa, and hiwa are used in
object position of a sentence/clause. This is illustrated in examples (3.8) and (3.9).

"1271283.5.4Adjective PhrasesUnlike numerals and the possessive prefix, the Adjective Phrase follows the
nouns. They may contain adverbs (intensifiers).
3.6 Adverbs
Jarawa has adverbs as a distinct word class. There is no derivational process to
convert adjectives into adverbs in this language. The adverbs which exist in this
language are purely lexical items. In this work adverbs will be classified as
intensifiers, temporal adverbs, and spatial adverbs.
3.6.1IntensifierThese are adverbs which modify adjectives or verbs. The number of adverbs in
this group is very small; only two or three such adverbs are attested. One of them
is ʈʰuhumə ‘very’. The adverb ʈʰuhumə is widely used to modify descriptive
adjectives and verbs. For instance, in example (3.105), ʈʰuhumə modifies an
adjective and in example (3.106) it modifies a verb. In both cases it follows the
element which it modifies.(3.105) paʈʰotaluʈʰuhuməarrowlongveryA very long arrow.","[145, 146]"
"5.5 Conclusion
This language is SOV but it deviates from the SOV patterns in many respects. A
tendency of SOV languages is to have postpositions, and this language also has a
postposition. Like some SOV languages Jarawa employs noun-adjective and
adjective-adverb patterns, but demonstratives, numerals and genitives precede
218219the nouns. In the comparative construction, the marker of comparison follows
the standard of comparison. Peripheral arguments/adpositional phrases precede
the verb. In complement clauses this language employs both the patterns,
complement clauses can occur before the verb or after the verb. The negative
particle or suffix appears at the end of clause.","[236, 237]"
