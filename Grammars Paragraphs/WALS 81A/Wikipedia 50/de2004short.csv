And he had hidden her wings.wingthaLF4. 1.2 Clause constituentsThere are two types of nom inal constituents in the I n anwatan clause, core nominals
(subject, object) and peripheral nominals. Core nominals are unmarked phrases, i.e. they do
not take postpositions, and are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes (see § 3 .4 . 1 ). Peripheral
nominals take postpositions and are not cross-referenced in the verb.
The core nominals subject and object are distinguished by order only (subject preceding
object). Only in personal pronouns is the opposition between subject and object expressed in
the form of the constituents (see §3 . 1 . 1 ).
Peripheral nominals (in all clause types) may occur clause-initially (when they express the
time, place or other type of frame for the clause), but a lso pre- or post verbally when they
qualify the event or state denoted by the predicate (for example manner peripherals).
NPs governed by -go denote time (4. 1 3 , 4. 1 5), place (4. 1 4), instrument (4. 1 5) and manner
(4 . 1 6). The postposition -go is restricted to inanimate NPs and has been glossed as CIRC
(circumstantial):

correspondences with the sets of personal pronouns and possessive prefixes (see §3. 1 ) but the
3SGIPL subject prefix me- is completely different from the personal and possessive forms.
Whereas the possessive prefixes undergo vowel-elision before noun-initial vowels, the
final vowels of the subject and object prefixes do not undergo elision. I nstead, vowel
sequences are formed, including double vowels, phonetically realised as long vowels, for
example Ine-era-rel 'I said' (['nE: rarE]) contrasting with Ine-ra-rel 'I held' ( ['nHarc]). The
final lei of the subject prefixes assimilates to 101 when the verb stem has an initial 101 or lui.

"3MorphologyThe relatively complex verb morphology of lnanwatan, where verbs can have up to five
affixes, is in contrast with the rather simple verb morphologies of the languages of the other
parts of the Bird ' s Head like Abun (Berry & Berry 1 999), Moi ( Menick 1 996, 2000),
M aybrat (Dol 1 999) and Hatam (Reesink 1 999). Verbs are i nflected for subject person,
number and gender, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect and negation. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes. l Gender is a pervasive feature of the
I nanwatan morphology, affecting all major wordclasses.","[39, 40]"
"1.5 Language death and ethnic identity in the Inanwatan communityThe I nanwatan people realize that their language is dying. This saddens older people but
most young people do not seem to care all that much. I nanwatan is a language they associate
with the past and a language they cannot use in cities l ike Sorong, Manokwari and Jayapura
where they would like to live, a language they cannot use in the work environments they
would like to be in. But the older people also accept the way things are going. These attitudes
to language death by generational erosion can be understood better if we realize the relatively
modest place the I nanwatan language has in the way the I nanwatan people construct their
ethnic identity.
An I nanwatan person derives his sense of identity primarily from the gob6 and Jawu he or
she was born in. The noun goM is used for bodies of water (sea; river; lake; tributary), for
localized descent groups (clans) living on ancestral lands surrounding those bodies of water
and finally for the ancestral lands themselves. A goM consists of (ideally) four Jam (Malay)
or Jaawu (adapted I nanwatan form) with each Jam descending from a different son of the
ancestor pair (van Oosterhout 2002:95- 10 1). The ancestral lands of the gob6 cannot be
sold; only rights to use the land can be sold, but the land itself is the inalienable possession of
the clan. Clan membership is defined in patrilineal terms. The land claims of the clan, the
origins of the clan, the places where the clan has lived, rights the clan has acquired through
warfare or alliances, all these crucial things are expressed in the oral tradition of the clan, the
stories of the clan. These stories are 'owned' by the clan and people who are not member of
the clan should not know them, certainly not in the sacred versions with the real names of the
ancestors, and are not allowed to tell them. A lso within the gob6 there are differences in
terms of access to the sacred stories and to the 'knowledge' embodied in them. The secrets
are only safe with a small group of elders, belonging to certain/am within the gob6. TheseIntroductionIIare considered to be sufficiently 'dry' and 'cooled ' to be able to deal with the heating powers
of 'knowledge' (van Oosterhout 2002 : 1 0 1 ).
Interestingly, in these clan owned stories, the ancestors sometimes do not speak I nanwatan
but Puragi, another South-Bird's Head family language, spoken in the area of the Upper
Metamani river; this area is seen as the area of origin of various groups of people who
nowadays speak various languages l ike I nanwatan and Kokoda. When I nanwatan people
visit the upper Metamani area, the use of the I nanwatan language is taboo (Dianne van
Oosterhout, pers. comm.). In I nanwatan oral stories, when ancestors sing magic chants,
often the words of those chants are Puragi (see for example Appendix 2, Part A, text 3,
no.5 ). When 1 asked people about this, some said that the ancestors spoke Puragi.
The fact that I nanwatan is not considered the language of the ancestors, at least not by all,
is significant to determine the place of the Inanwatan language in the identity of I nanwatan
people. And the oral tradition of the clan, containing its history and rights, is transmitted in
both the I nanwatan and the Malay language, and can be 'stolen' in both forms. The
'knowledge' embodied in the oral traditions is what counts and not the l inguistic form in
which this 'knowledge' is formulated (see van Oosterhout 2002 :99 for the I nanwatan
concept of 'knowledge' and its relation to clan owned stories and claims to ancestral lands).
It is clear that the I nanwatan language has a place in the I nanwatan ethnic identity but the
notion of gob6 (gob6 land, gob6 flesh and blood, gob6 knowledge) occupies a much more
central place in the way the I nanwatan define themselves than the I nanwatan language.
Notice that the I nanwatan have generic words and proper names for social groups like clans
(gob6) and subclans (jaa wu) but have no word or name for I nanwatan as an ethnolinguistic
group (van Oosterhout 2002: 1 75 ) nor for I nanwatan as a language. For speakers of
I nanwatan, l nanwatan is a place name used by outsiders to label what they see as a 'tribe',
suku or 'ethnolinguistic group'. When I nanwatan define themselves in other terms than those
of gob6 and jaawu they 'skip' the level of the 'ethnolinguistic group' and switch to the Malay
political-religious discourse (kitorang Kristen 'we are Christians', kitorang Papua 'we are
Papuans').
,1.6 The linguistic position of the Inanwatan languageAs far as links to Papuan languages are concerned, to the east and north of I nanwatan, the
Puragi language is spoken in the villages Saga, Puragi, Bedare and I sogo. Puragi belongs to
the South Bird's Head family to which Arandai also belongs (Voorhoeve 1 98 5 ). Yahadian,
of the Konda-Yahadian family, spoken in the villages Mugim and Yahadian, is the western
neighbour of the Inanwatan language. I n initial survey work, I found only 8% possible
lexical correspondences between Yahadian and I nanwatan ( 1 6 lexical correspondences in
202 items) whereas 1 found 25% lexical correspondences between I nanwatan and Puragi
(52 lex ical correspondences in 1 99 items). With Kokoda, also of the South Bird Head family
and spoken to the east of Puragi, I nanwatan has 4 1 lexical correspondences in 202 items
(20%).
Structurally, Inanwatan shows many correspondences with Puragi and Kokoda in
phonology and morphology whereas I nanwatan is strikingly different from Yahadian in these
regards. In Kokoda and Puragi , for example, a masculine-feminine gender distinction is a
pervasive feature of the morphosyntax affecting 3SG verb forms, adjectives, demonstratives
and nouns. Their gender systems resemble the Inanwatan system very closely, with back12Chapter 1vowels associated with the feminine gender and with plural ity and front vowels with the
masculine gender. Example ( I . 7) is from Kokoda, ( 1 .8) from Puragi, ( 1 .9) from lnanwatan
and ( 1 . 1 0) from Yahadian:
Kokoda:

Yahadian:

This woman is bad.
On the other hand, the Kokoda and Puragi verb paradigms in my survey data have only
suffixes and I found no subject and object prefixes as we find in Inanwatan. Further research
of these South Bird's Head languages is badly needed to establi sh their relationship to
Inanwatan.
Concerning lexical links with other Papuan language fami l ies, Voorhoeve ( 1 975 :443,
445) gives average cognation percentages of the I nanwatan fam i ly with other Papuan
language fam ilies: for example, 4.7% with the Central Bird's Head fam ily, 5.5% with the
North Bird's Head family, 8 . 1 % with the West Bird 's Head family, 7.5% with the Marind
and Asmat-Kamoro families, 7.7% with the Ok family, 5.5 with the Dani family, 7.2% with
the Awyu family, 9.5% with the Kolopom family and 4.3% with the Sentani family.
These percentages are all below 1 0% and point in all directions: to Bird's Head language
families, to typical Trans New Guinea language families l ike the A wyu and to aberrantIntroduction13language families of South I rian Jaya like the M arind. Explaining the lexical links with Bird's
Head languages as borrowings, V oorhoeve ( 1 975) classified I nanwatan as a Trans New
Guinea language.
At that time, very little structural i n formation on the Inanwatan family was available and
the Marind languages were, with some hesitation, considered as Tran s New Guinea
languages. The structural information on I nanwatan available to Voorhoeve ( 1 9 75), the
pronoun system, pointed into the direction of the Trans New Guinea Phylum. The I nanwatan
pronouns of first person have initial In!, those of second person an initial vowel and plural
forms have more fronted or higher vowels than those of singular forms. According to
Voorhoeve ( 1 975:444), such pronoun sets occur widespread in South West New Guinea and
the western h ighlands. As in other coastal areas of New Guinea with intensive contact with
Austronesian languages, lnanwatan distinguishes exclusive and inclusive first person plura l
pronouns.
The typology and relative complexity of the morphology of l nanwatan sets it clearly apart
from the simple verb morphologies of the other Bird's H ead languages (see Reesink, ed.
1 996, 2000, 2002). But the type of morphosyntax of I nanwatan is very different from the
typical Trans New Guinea morphosyntax of mainland Papuan language families as described
by McElhanon, Voorhoeve and W urm ( 1 97 5:299-322). I nanwatan has no clause chaining
with medial verbs, no serial verbs and no switch-reference. I nstead, Inanwatan coordinates
fully inflected verbs. I ts verb morphology also deviates strongly with its subject and object
prefixation. The presence of subject and object prefixes in the verb (s-o-v) is rare in Papuan
languages, it occurs in only three of the over sixty families of Papuan languages, namely
Marind family (Drabbe 1 955), Northern Halmahera family (van Baarda 1 89 1 ) and South
Bird's Head family. Gender pervades the I nanwatan language in ways unknown to Trans
New Guinea languages.
Summarizing, I nanwatan most probably is a member of the South Bird's Head family of
Papuan languages. I ts lex ical l inks point in all directions. Structurally, I nanwatan is different
from both Bird's Head languages and languages of the Trans New Guinea group.
1.7 Inanwatan and the Marind languagesWhen we compare the structural data on I nanwatan with what is k nown of the Marind
stock (Marind, Yaqai and Boazi fami lies, Drabbe 1 95 5 ), I nanwatan seems to fit the
typological picture of these Marind l anguages, both in broad outline and in details of its
morphology.
The M arind languages are spoken in the central south coast area of New Guinea. It has
been recognized for a long time that the Marind languages display a number of striking
characteristics, aberrant from the point of view of the Trans New Guinea grouping of
languages as McElhanon, Voorhoeve and Wurm ( 1 975) noticed. The M arind languages
combine the following characteristics:
( 1 . 1 I ) the typology of Marind languages:
(i)the verb has a subject prefix followed by an object prefix in a basic SOY clause;(ii)there are suppletive verb stems to indicate plurality of the subject (and
sometimes of the object);14Chapter 1(iii)there are (often elaborate) gender systems with concord phenomena and with
front vowels i ndicating masculine and back vowels indicating feminine
gender;(iv)there is coordination of fully inflected verbs instead of clause chaining with
medial verbs, and no or marginal presence of serial verbsConsider the fol lowing M arind data from Drabbe ( 1 955). Examples ( 1 . 1 2) and ( 1 . 1 3)
show the gender system, ( 1 . 1 4- 1 . 1 6) show subject and object prefixes and ( 1 . 1 7) shows
suppletive plural stems of verbs:

for Scientific Research (NWO) program The I rian Jaya Studies: a programme for
interdisciplinary research (ISIR) headed by Wim Stokhof and as part of the Spinoza (NWO)
research program Lexicon and Syntax headed by Pieter M uysken. The I SI R programme was
carried out in cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia ). Inanwatan was
chosen within the I SI R research program to represent the languages of the southern Bird's
Head, linguistically terra incognita. I collected data in I nanwatan in the first three months of
1 994 and during three months in 1 995.
Thanks are due to Dr Hasan Alwi (Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Jakarta)
and to Dr A.O. Atururi (then Bupati of the Sorong regency) for their support and interest in my
research and to Mr Dominggus Murray of Inanwatan for teaching me the Inanwatan language
and for recruiting many excellent informants like Titus Mamary, Bernard Mitogai, Agustinus
Yawae, Set Eramuri and Set Setoge all of whom I thank for their patience and kindness. I
should thank Bert Voorhoeve for giving me his unpublished notes on the Inanwatan language
based on work with an I nanwatan informant in Bintuni, Irian Jaya, in 1 9 82, and the Summer
Institute of Linguistics, at Abepura, for sending me copies of the survey reports of Gravelle
(1986), Berry and Berry ( 1 987) and Kempf (n.d.). Dianne van Oosterhout, who worked as an
anthropologist in I nanwatan for the I SI R project deserves thanks for sharing insights and data
with me. The Benawa word list found in the Appendix 3 was taken by her. She also supplied me
with a number of local Malay texts of the Inanwatan area. M arian Klamer and Ger Reesink
took the trouble to read the whole manuscript critically, and this led to numerous improvements
in the analysis and presentation of the Inanwatan data. Thanks!ixAbbreviations23

"3.3. 4 CompoundsI n noun compounds a modifying noun stem precedes a modified noun stem. When the
modifying noun stem is a feminine noun ending in 10/, the final vowel becomes lal in the
compound noun. The stress of the modified noun becomes the main stress of the compound.
The stress of the modifying noun becomes a secondary stress. Examples:

There are four classes of verbs, intransitive, transitive, ditransitive and copular verbs (-ra
and i-). Copular verbs have either their own, limited inflection (-ra) or no inflection (i-). The
other verb classes share inflection for person, number and gender of the subject, tense, aspect
and negation. Transitive and ditransitive verbs may mark the object in the verb, but only
when the object is the speaker or the addressee. Subject and object are crossreferenced or
expressed by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third person future
forms which have subject suffixes. A sizeable minority of verbs have suppletive plura l
stems, for example uwu- 'to sit', with plural stem te-, se- 'to go'with plural stem reqa-, miwi­
'to run' with plural stem noda-, qebadi- 'to turn (fNTR) with plural stem qebate-, na- 'to cry'
with plural stem neberu- and nou- 'to fall' with plural stem nouquge-.",[48]
"4Chapter J1.2 Transcribing and analyzing speech in bilingual communitiesLinguists collecting a nd transcribing vernacular speech in bilingual communities of
I ndonesia will increasingly observe Malay elements in their transcribed texts. This creates
special difficulties for the field linguist, for example how to separate Malayicized vernacu lar
from M alay in the transcriptions. Consider the following examples from three texts recorded

ratusThere are two types of Malay forms in such transcriptions of bilingual speech as in
(I. I }--( 1 .4), forms that conform to the patterns of regional Malay spoken i n the Bird's Head
such as sementara and Desember. And forms that violate those patterns such as duaberas in
(1.3) and sikorao-wai in ( 1 . 1 ). I n ( 1 .4) the Malay word lima 'five' occurs i n adapted (niwa)
and non-adapted form (lim a ) within one utterance. Since the deviations from the regional
Malay standards follow from adaptations of these forms in the direction of the vernacular
language, in this case I nanwatan, I will cal1 forms such as duaberas, niwapuru, sikorao-wai
adapted forms and forms l ike duabelas, limapulu, sekola non-adapted forms. Of course,
regional Malay varieties are oral, non-standardized varieties with a lot of variation, not only
horizontal1y, from place to place, but also vertical ly because regional Malay i s a sociolect
continuum with basolects, mesolects and acrolects. I t is normal for texts in local Malay to
mix elements from basolects, mesolects and acrolects. So, the norms are rather flexible.
Nevertheless, forms l ike dua beras, niwapuru, sikorao-wa i are recognized by I nanwatan
speakers as 'bad' Malay when these forms occur in Malay-only genres such as sermons in
church.
'Pure' regional M alay (without code m ixing and without I nanwatan loans) is used i n
church, school and government contexts and as an interethnic lingua franca (see Appendix 2
Texts, Part C for a text in this local M alay). Relatively 'pure' I nanwatan (without code
mixing, but with some Malay loans) is used in certain genres of the oral tradition like the
tugarido genre (clan (gob6) owned heirloom stories, see for example Appendix 2, Texts, Part
A, texts 1 and 2). Continuous, intensive M a lay/lnanwatan mixing is used within the
community as the default means of communication, exemplified by texts 2 and 3 of Part B,
Appendix 2, Texts).
It is to be expected that the I nanwatan morphosyntax is not immune from influence from
the morphosyntax of Malay but since we do not have k nowledge of older stages in the
development of I nanwatan, such influence is hard to assess. For example, nowadays SVO
constituent order occurs in frequent variation with SOY order in I nanwatan clauses but we do
not know what the clause order was before contact with Malay. But it is clear that not only
lexical words but also complete classes of grammatical words or function words have been
borrowed from Malay, for example discourse conjunctions (like baru and j adi see §4.3 .2)
and numerals (see §3.7 and §4.4.4). The inclusive-exclusive distinction in first person plural
,6Chapter Jpronouns and verbs (see Chapter 3 ) very likely derives from contact with Austronesian
languages like Malay and Sekar since only non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea
bordering on Austronesian languages or in close contact with them have the inclusive­
exclusive opposition.","[16, 17, 18, 19]"

The verbs de- and wo- are phonologically and morphologically i ntegrated in the compound

'to carry' in (4 . 3 6) is phonologically one word with the inflected second verb. A sign that
these phrasal verb combinations form phonologlcal words is the stress pattern, the bare verb
root attracts the main word stress and the second inflected verb receives secondary stress.
Another sign is that the Iml of the subject prefix me- is always realized by its intervocalic
allophone [w]. The fact that the subject and object prefixes separate the bare verb form the
following inflected verb signals that there is no morphological integration of the two verbs, in
contrast with compound verbs. Complex phrasal verbs frequently occur in the texts (see
Appendix 2), both with two I nanwatan verbs and with a Malay loan or code mix followed by
an inflected form of ge- 'to do' (see § 1 . 3 ).",[70]

'to fell' (plural object)The south coast area where M arind languages are spoken has a long history of large-scale,
frequent headhunting. Knauft ( 1 993) describes how this region placed particular cultural
emphasis on the creation of life-power through ritual sexuality and on the taki ng of l ife­
power by severing enemy heads. Throughout the region, ethnographers found cosmological
links between the fertility power of ritual sexuality and that of headhunting. Knauft ( 1 993)
points out how the swampy coastal plains, the many rivers, the shallow coastal waters, ful l of
fish, and the abundance of storable and transportable sago created the ecological conditions
for large scale, frequent military operations by the Marind (and other groups) which found
their cultural basis in this headhunting-ferti lity complex.
Van Baal ( 1 966) describes the Marind headhunting practices in detail. Marind groups
used to organise their headhunting expeditions every year. The M arind war parties were
large. We know this because of confrontations with colonial officers who wrote reports at the
end of the 1 9th century. I n 1 884, for example, Captain Strachan discovered 1 200 Marind in
3 5 war canoes across the international border some 300 kilometres east of the Marind homeIntroduction15bases (Knauft 1 99 3 : 1 56). I n 1 8 96, Lieutenant William MacGregor encountered 75 manned
Marind war canoes and captured 48 canoes, which contained dozens of bundles of sago each
weighing around twelve pounds. This party numbered 1 500 or more persons, 250 kilometres
away from their home settlements (van Baal 1 966:7 1 3).
Crucial for the linguistic diffusion of Marind features was the gradual establishment by
headhunting groups of corridors where groups who had been victims in the past, became
allies, in the sense that they allowed headhunting parties to cross their territories to reach
groups even further away. The M arind exported cultural characteristics and linguistic
features along these corridors. Van Baal ( 1 984) describes the situation as follows:
Marind-Anim culture was an expanding culture, spreading from the coast to the
interior, and along the coast from east to west. (van Baal 1 984: 1 29)In this historical context, it is not surprising to find some of the Marind stock characteristics
in Trans-Fly stock and Ok languages to the east and north of the Marind area. Southern Kati,
for example, is a Lowland Ok language showing on the one hand Trans New Guinea features
like clause chaining with medial verbs, and subject suffixation but on the other hand some of
the Marind features are present (Voorhoeve 1 9 7 5 : 3 8 1 ) like object prefixation with some
verbs, a few verbs having suppletive plural stems and a two-gender distinction in nouns and
3S0 personal pronouns, with a back vowel (F) and front vowel (M) opposition (for example,
ye 'he', yu 'she'). The Ok languages Telefol and Ninggerum have similar patterns. Many
Trans-Fly stock languages also display one or more of the M arind features. For example,
object prefixes are widespread in the Trans-Fly stock but on the other hand subject suffixes
are very common there (see Wurm 1 975:323-344).
W hereas Trans-Fly and Ok languages show the four Marind typological characteristics of

"1.3 Types of adaptation occurring in Malay elements(a) Phonemic and allophonic adaptation:lnanwatan has nasal phonemes with oral allophones. The Inanwatan phoneme Inl has
three allophones [n], [rl and [rl. The allophone [nl occurs word-initially and lr/r] word­
medially. The flapped vibrant [rl freely varies with (rl, the rolled vibrant, the latter being the
most frequent realization. Examples: ['ncr:>1 'name', ['a-rEr:>] 'your name', f'nira] 'day' ['nira­
rira] 'each day'. The Inanwatan phoneme Iml has three allophones [ml, [w] and (P]. The
allophone [m] occurs word-initially, [w] medially adjacent to back vowels (i.e. followed
and/or preceded by [0], [u] or [:>]) and [p] elsewhere. Examples: ['muwur::>] 'rivers'; ['napE]
'me (object)'.
Now in foreign words, word-medial [mJ may be pronounced as lw] or [PJ and the initial
[w] of source forms as [m]. Examples: Dutch e m m er 'bucket' is adapted to ('EPEf::>].
Indonesian wakil 'deputy' is adapted to ['makiriJ 'deputy headman (raja)', Indonesian kaca
m a ta 'glasses' is adapted to ['kaowato]; Indonesian limap u luh 'fifty' to Inanwatan
['nipapuru]. Dutch commissie, a term used for the Patipi headmen appointed by the Dutch
administration to rule Inanwatan, is adapted to ['bwisi]. Medial [n] is adapted to [r/r] in
foreign words. For example, the Patipi word inanwatan is adapted both to the word structure
prohibiting final C and CC clusters (>/iminowatanol, by vowel insertions) and to the
allophonic patterns of the Inanwatan language ([i'rar:>watar::>]. Malay II/ is replaced by
Inanwatan Inl with its oral allophones [ric], for example Malay wakil 'deputy' is adapted to
['makiri] 'deputy headman'.
(b) Phonotactic adaptationInanwatan phonotaxis does not allow CC clusters and final C. Vowel insertion and
consonant deletion are employed to adapt foreign words to Inanwatan phonotactics, for
example p6toroti 'pencil' is the adapted form of Dutch po/lood).
(c) A daptation in word stress and intonation contoursInanwatan has unpredictable, lexical word stress. Quite often the word stress of foreign
words changes in borrowed words, e.g. regional Malay pandita>Inanwatan paditae '(male)
minister'. When two Malay utterances are linked by recapitulative strategies reflecting
'Papuan ' tail-head linkages, the intonation contour is adapted towards the typical
fall-rise-pause pattern associated with 'Papuan' tail-head linkage. See §4.3. 1 for Inanwatan
recapitulative linkage strategies.
(d) Semantic adaptationMeanings of foreign words may change, for example Malay kapa/ means 'non-native
boat' in both its adapted form (kaparo) and non-adapted form. Because of the gender systemIntroduction7of I nanwatan, gender-neutral foreign nouns referring to animate entities develop gender­
specific meanings e.g. Malay pandfta 'minister' > Inanwatan paditae 'male minister'.
(e) Morphological adaptationMorphological adaptation can be illustrated with the integration of nouns and verbs in
the I nanwatan morphology.
Gender in I nanwatan nouns is marked by the last vowel, with nouns ending in a front
vowel (Ii!, lei) being masculine and the remaining nouns (ending in 101, lui and la/) feminine.
In a minority of nouns, gender has a semantic basis (male and female). Now borrowed nouns
denoting humans have lei or Iii added when they denote males and 101 when they denote
females, for example Malay guru 'teacher', has the I nanwatan forms gurui '(male) teacher',
guruo '(female) teacher'. I nanimate borrowed nouns are assigned a gender on the basis of
their final vowel, if they end in a vowel. When they end in a consonant, they are assigned a
gender by the addition of 101 or Ie, i!. Examples: ewero 'bucket' « Dutch emmer), kompasi
'compass' « Dutch kompas), kaparo 'ship' « Malay kapaL), potoroti 'penci l ' « Dutch
potlood), pensili « Malay pensil 'pencil'), listriki 'electricity' « M alay listrik), tabQqido
'tobacco' « Dutch tabak). The addition of vowels is done arbitrarily, that is, I have not (yet)
been able to find a semantic or phonetic base for the gender-integration of such non-human
nouns.
I nanwatan has a complex verb morphology. Verbs are inflected for subject person and
number, object person and number, tense, mood, aspect, negation and gender. Subject and
object are cross-referenced by verbal prefixes, with the exception of counterfactual and third
person future forms which have subject suffixes. To integrate foreign verbs into this system,
Malay verbs (like buka 'to open') are productively combined with the verb ge- 'to do' in
complex phrasal verbs (see §4.2. 1 ). Phonologically, the Malay verb and the verb ge- with its
prefixes and suffixes are integrated under one stress contour and the first 1m! of the subject
prefix Ime-I is always realised by the intervocalic allophone [ w ] . Thus buka-we-ge-re
(open-3.s-take-PAST) instead of buka me-ge-re. Another way to integrate Malay verbs found
in the text is to adapt a Malay stem phonologically and then attach affixes to it as in
me-susa-re 'they lamented, wailed' (from regional Malay bersusa 'to lament, to wail ').
These phonological and morphological adaptation processes have drastic effects on the
form of Malay items. In the speech of bilingual members of the I nanwatan community one
can find hundreds of pairs of words with a Malay item alongside its adapted l nanwatan
counterpart. Examples: sfkoraolsekolah 'school', ttiu-goltahun 'year' (in which -go is the
I nanwatan circumstantial postposition), keredidaolkerja 'work ', kapa rolkapal 'ship', fko­
likul 'to follow someone'. Many of these adapted forms have been around for a long time in
the community and have a stable, conventional form. Although adaptation occurs very
frequently not every Malay element occurs in two forms (adapted and non-adapted). Some
words, like sementara 'temporary' in (1.1), always seem to have the same non-adapted form,
even when they are integrated within I nanwatan morphology.","[19, 20]"

Attributive-equative clauses (S P-ra) have non-verbal predicates expressing possession,
attribution and equation (see §3 .4.7 for examples). These clauses contain the copular verb
-ra, a special verb with irregular forms which express only person , number and gender (see
§3.4.7). The copular verb cliticizes to predicative adjectives and nouns. The predicate is the

A special subtype of intransitive clauses is based on experiential verbs, intransitive verbs
that take a bodypart as their first argument and express emotional and physical experiences.
Because the bodypart argument is always subject, the verb is always a third person form. The

I n example ( 1 .6) the verb ge- 'to do' occurs five times. It occurs with the adapted nouns
keredidau 'work ' in ( 1 .6a), sikorao 'school' in ( 1 .6f) and prakteki 'practice' in ( 1 .6g), with
the unadapted Malay alternating code mix kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu in ( 1 .6e)
and with the Malay loan verb angka- 'to appoint' in (l.6b). The verb ge- can be used as an
alternation device, for example kepala Kampong e Desa berhenti dulu d-ge-re in ( 1 . 6e) and
as an insertion device, for example prakteki re-ge-re in ( 1 .6g). When used as an insertion
device, ge- forms complex phrasal verbs with the preceding Malay words (see §4.2.1). Again
the boundary between insertional code m ixing with ge- and borrowing is very hard to draw.
Malay words may be borrowed without adaptation. For example the loan conjunctions
terus, jadi, baru, suda(h), a tau, tapi, dan have various discourse connective functions inInanwatan and are never adapted. But most borrowed elements from open lexical classes
undergo adaptations.
l nanwatan speakers call the process of code mixing Lompat, a Malay verb meaning 'to
jump' and they usually have no problems separating 'speaking Tnanwatan ' from 'speaking
M alay '. For example when asked about utterances as in (1.2d) they will say that Yunus4-de is an allomorph of the Past suffix -re occurring after stem-final Iii (see §3.4.2.1).",[22]

M arind are significant since these are rare outside the Marind stock: as we saw above, the
back and front vowel opposition is found in Ok languages in personal pronouns (e.g.
Ninggerum, Southern Kati), north of the Marind, one of their traditional headhunting areas
(Knauft 1 99 3 : 1 6 1 ). The Sepik and Torricelli groups also have gender systems but gender is
not indicated by vowel oppositions, with an occasional exception in personal pronouns such
as the I wam (Sepik) pronouns si 'he' and sa 'she' which have a vowel opposition between
front and mid vowels (Laycock & Z'Graggen 1 975:742).
I nanwatan is spoken in the western part of the New Guinea south coast whereas the
M arind languages are spoken in the central part of the New Guinea south coast area. I n
between, we mostly find Asmat-Kamoro languages and some Austronesian languages. For
future research, I would like to hypothesize the idea that Inanwatan is a western member of
the M arind stock. We would have to assume that I nanwatan became separated from the
other M arind languages by the arrival of Trans New Guinea groups such as the Asmat­
Kamoro, probably from the mountains, and Austronesian groups like the Patipi, probably
over sea. Admittedly, the average lexical correspondence percentage of 7 . 5 % between
Inanwatan and M arind is rather low. Wurrn ( 1 975) takes 1 2% as the boundary below which
inclusion in a stock of language families is not defendable. However, if we take structural
considerations into account, the similarity between I nanwatan and the M arind languages
could well be too great to be coincidental. Notice that the gender and subject/object cross­
referencing morphology of I nanwatan and Marind is very similar, both in the morphological
pattern and in the grammatical morphemes. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of the shared
gender morphology (front vowels=M , back vowels=F) and the verbal pattern (s-o-verb) is
rather high since both are rare in New Guinea. Foley ( 1 9 8 6 : 1 38 ), for example, states:
'Marind is the only Papuan language I know which consistently exhibits A-U- V.'","[28, 29]"
"4.1 The clause4. 1. 1 Clause typesThere are al least four clause types, locative-exislenlial clauses (i-oEM S Loc), altribulive­
equative clauses (S P-ra), transitive clauses (SOV/SVO) and intransitive clauses (S V).
Locative-existential clauses have as first constituent the invariable predicative element i­
'to be' with demonstrative clitics altached to it that (cross)refer to the subject. Then follows
the subject NP and a locative nominal predicate:

"4.2.2 Clausal arguments of verbsPerception and cognition verbs have finite object clauses immediately following the verbs.
There are no complementisers or any other formal markings of the complement nature of the
clause. An alternative analysis would be to view these clauses as asyndetically linked
coordinated clauses that are pragmatically interpreted as goals of the preceding perception
verbs.

"1.1 Research framework and data collectionData for this book were collected in the framework of the Netherlands Organization for
Scientific Research program The I rian Jaya Studies: a program me for i nterdisciplinary
research (ISIR) and further analyzed as part of the Spinoza (NWO) research program
Lexicon and Syntax.
I nanwatan was chosen within the ISIR research program to represent the languages of the
southern Bird's Head. This whole area is linguistically unknown and a data oriented study of
at least one language was seen to be important for a general picture of Papuan languages.
I ndeed l nanwatan and other south Bird's Head languages that I surveyed turned out to be
typologically distinct in i nteresting ways from both the languages of the Bird's Head and
Trans New Guinea languages (see § I .6 and § I .7).
The relevance of the Inanwalan data for the Spinoza program of Pieter M uysken that
focuses on language contact, resides in the fact that most I nanwatan speakers constantly rely
on two languages, M alay and I nanwatan, to construct their messages. I ntense bilingualism i n
situations o f generational erosion creates specific field linguistic problems, i n the collection,
transcription and analysis of the data (see § 1 .2).
I recorded and transcribed word l ists and oral texts in I nanwatan in the first three months
of 1 994 and during three months in 1 995. Since I had only six months of exposure to the
language, I do not pretend to present more than a preliminary survey of some major patterns
of the language as they could be observed in the word lists and texts that I collected.
There is a c lear age and gender bias in the I nanwatan data since the majority of my
informants were older, male speakers. Male informants were easier to get and easier to work
with for cultural reasons. The age bias follows from the fact that only older people are fluent
speakers of the I nanwatan language and still use it as their first language in daily life. The
Inanwatan community was very supportive of my research and many people volunteered to
tell stories, take me along on trips and to their houses knowing that I was recording all that
was said during those visits and trips.
Although the description is mostly based on natural speech that I recorded and transcribed,
I also made use of data elicited in Malay. These data are marked by (el.) after the reference
number. I used direct elicitation only where I judged the chance for i nterference from the
Malay stimuli to be relatively small but still there is no doubt a Malay bias in these elicited
data.",[16]

"2728Chapter 3allomorphs iti- (with third person subject forms) and -ri (in variation with -iti) in 1 SG and 2SG
forms.
The oblique forms occur sometimes in a longer form (e.g. nagadara in stead of naga).
The oblique forms are used for personal pronouns with peripheral functions in the clause (see
§4. 1 .2 for the distinction between core and peripheral nominals in I nanwatan). The oblique
forms most likely consist of (former) postpositions attached to the personal pronouns. For the
third person forms this is certain: -ra is a postposition meaning 'to, for, about' (see §4. 1 .2).
So far I have not encountered a postposition -ga or -gadara . There are also combinations of
personal pronouns and the postpositions -wai 'to' (direction) and -(u)ru '(together)with'
(comitative):

I have found the emphatic forms so far only combined with non-emphatic subject forms.
Possibly the -wa morpheme in the emphatic forms derives from the proximate demonstrative
element - wa, compare the frequent local Malay emphatic form saya ini literally 'I here'.

"Although Malay words may be inserted without any adaptation, in insertional code mixing
levels of adaptation are much higher than in alternating code mixing and adaptation occurs
on phonemic, phonotactic and prosodic levels. Therefore the distinction between insertional

Noun phrases are distinct from compound nouns (see § 3 . 3 .4). I n noun compounds a
modifying noun stem precedes a modified noun stem under one stress contour. When the
modifying noun stem is a feminine noun ending in /0/ (the large majority of nouns), the final
vowel becomes /a/ in the compound noun, for example:

sero
ira-serogong

story about a gongI n noun phrases the constituents are not brought under one stress contour, as in (4.60)
where the possessor noun orewo modifying the possessed (compound) head noun a ibasero
retains its lexical stress and the final /0/ of modifying feminine nouns does not change into
/a/:

languages of the Inanwatan
districtThis appendix presents survey data concerning the languages of the I nanwatan district.
Since the Austronesian language Patipi, spoken in the Bomberai peninsula, has had a major
role as contact-language in the I nanwatan district until M alay took over that role in the
beginning of this century, I will also present Patipi data.
I found 8 % lex ical correspondence between Yahadian and Inanwatan ( 1 6 corresponding
items in a l ist of 202 words) whereas I found 2 5 % lexical correspondence between
l nanwatan a nd Puragi (52 corresponding words in 1 99 items). Furthermore, I nanwatan
shows many correspondences with Puragi in phonology and morphology whereas the
Yahadian phonology and morphology are strikingly different from I nanwatan and Puragi.
Since lexical correspondence percentages tend to turn out much higher in later research than
revealed by initial surveys, the results of my survey shed doubt on a separate status of the
I nanwatan family (Voorhoeve 1 97 5 ; Berry & Berry 1 987). Of course, further research is
needed to establish l nanwatan as a member of the South-Bird's Head family. I used the
Summer I nstitute of Linguistics (Irian Jaya) 209 item survey list to collect lexical data.
Besides Inanwatan the following five languages are spoken in the I nanwatan district

"2Chapter 1Duriankari speakers are regarded as I nanwatan people who in ancient times were carried off
to the Sele Strait area by a flood (see Texts, Part A, no.4» . When I visited the I nanwatan
speaking community of the village Seget, situated at the southern entrance to the Sele Strait,
in M arch ] 994, the I nanwatan people there claimed that the Duriankari language was no
longer used. Below we will discuss the possibility that Inanwatan is not an isolate but a
member of the South Bird's Head family. The language, village and district name I nanwatan
originates from a Patipi expression meaning 'sago only' or 'it is all sago' (ina n 'sago' and
sewatan 'one'). The immense sago swamps of the I nanwatan area inspired Patipi colonists to
call the area I nanwatan ('it is all sago'). Patipi is a village on the south coast of the Bomberai
peninsula, in the Onin area. I nanwatan people use the name Patipi also for the Austronesian
language of the Bomberai peninsula known as Sekar, a dialect of the Onin language, spoken
today in Kokas by about 600 persons. Some I nanwatan people called their language the
Iriirowata ro language when talking to me,3 an adaptation of the word I nanwatan to the
sound patterns of the l nanwatan language (see below) but n idiiibo 'our language (voice)' is
the normal way to refer to the language. The North-Moluccan Sultans of Tidore had their
' middle men' in the Onin area who established trade monopolies on the Bird's Head south
coast, especially where major rivers watered into the MacCluer Gulf and the Seram Sea.
These 'middle men ' had the M alay title raja 'king'. There were raja's in the villages
R umbati, Patipi, Ati-Ati and Fatagar and each raja had his own section of the Bird's Head
south coast where he had some influence through representatives who settled near river
m ouths (see Vink 1932:4 1 ). The raja of Patipi sent representatives to the Siganoi river
mouth where they engaged in slave trade with the Inanwatan people. To get slaves, the
I na nwatan raided the interior but also neigbouring coastal peoples like the Yahadian. I n
exchange for the slaves, they received cloths, iron tools and weapons and guns from the
Patipi 'middle men'. Although these raja 's of Patipi never established a regular government
in the Inanwatan area, the Patipi colonists in I nanwatan married local women and Patipi
words were borrowed by the I nanwatan language. To confirm the Patipi origin of the name
I nanwatan and to investigate lexical links between I nanwatan and Patipi, an Austronesian
language, I visited the Patipi speaking village Kokas in October 1 99 5 . Examples of
I nanwatan words with Patipi origin: nati raja (king)' (>Patipi na ti), noto 'cloth; sarong'
(>Patipi not), pasao 'rice' (>Patipi pasa), sosorao 'forked fishing spear' (>Patipi sosona).
Between the 1 6th and the end of the 19th century, Patipi (Onin, Sekar) had become an
i mportant lingua franca in the M acCluer Gulf area. Old I nanwatan people told me that the
first protestant evangelists in I nanwatan (from ] 908 on) used a mixture of Patipi and M alay
in their sermons. The senior Dutch civil servant F.H . Dumas writes in his Memorie van
Overgave (Memorandum of Conveyance) in ] 9 ] 1: 'De op Bira geplaatste ambtenaar E.A.
Tanasale is [ ... ] de Papoeataal van Onin, die ook daar verstaan wordt machtig. ' (The c ivil
servant E.A. Tanasale who has been placed in Bira knows the Papuan language of On in
which is also understood there.) With the arrival of the Dutch colonial administration in
I nanwatan in 1 908, the Patipi influence diminished, although the Dutch initially ruled the
I nanwatan area through appointed Patipi raja who were called raja -comm issie (kowisi in the
Inanwatan language).
The relationship with Onin and Patipi is strongly reflected in the oral tradition of the
l nanwatan people. For example, 1 recorded a story about Namora, the first raja of
'3Possibly reflecting my use of the Malay term bahasa Inanwatan.","[14, 15]"
"2 . 1 Consonants
The consonant system is rather simple, with four points of articulation and only three
manner classes: plosives, fricatives and nasals. The nasals are striking because of their
phonetically wide range of allophones, for example Iml is realized as [m], (f3] and [w). Chart
of consonant phonemes (with allophones in brackets):

? [?]2. 1. 1 Nasals
The phoneme In! has three allophones en], [rl and [fl. The allophone [n] occurs word­
initially and [r/r] word-medially. The flapped vibrant [f] freely varies with [r], the rolled
vibrant, the latter being the most frequent realization. Consider the following examples.

is adapted both to the word structure prohibiting final C and CC clusters (>/im'inowatanol, by
vowel insertions) and to t he allophonic patterns of the l nanwatan language ( [i'faf:)wataf:)].

"Introduction171.S. 1 Sago and sago related terminologyThe I nanwatan people are a typical south coast lowland community that subsists from
sago and fish. The I nanwatan distinguish at least eight sub species of sago palm trees (suqf
'sago tree'). Dependent on the sub-species, sago trees take ten to twelve years to mature. As
far as the production of sago flour is concerned, just before flowering (when the amount of
starch in the sago tree is maximal), the men cut (suqf u- 'to cut down the sago tree') the tree
after which they cut the trunk in a few big pieces called sow6to 'trunk part'. An average
sow6to trunk part measures 2 metre. The number of people available to work determines the
size and number of the trunk parts. Then the bark of the trunk parts must be removed
(sow6to [qore- 'to remove bark from trunk parts') and the trunk parts opened.
Next, the women, sometimes assisted by the men, pound (qaa- 'to pound sago') the sago­
containing fibres (m6wuqo) in order to be removed from the tree. The instrument used to
pound the sago is called maqo. Once removed from the tree, the sago-containing fibres are
called gugo.
Next, they put the pounded fibers in bags (lebo) made from woody shafts of sago leaves
and transport them from the place where the sago palm was felled to a nearby spot where
there is stream or well. At that place the washing out of the sago flour takes place. To do
this the women set up a structure consisting of (at least) two connected woody shafts of sago
leaves. At the connection points, filters of hairy upper parts of sago leaf shaft (mugo) or a
part of an old shirt (also called mugo) are placed. In the first shaft, called qaro, the mixture
of water and fibers is pressed and k neaded by the hands of the women (gugo noi- 'to k nead
sago fibers'). The fibers remain in the first higher shaft while the suspension of sago flour
flows through the mugo filter into the second lower shaft, called b6wo, at the end of which
sago fibers (that have been washed out a lready) are placed in such a way that the water
slowly runs away whereas the sago flour settles.
The resulting lumps of sago flour, ready to be baked, are called suqere. When grilled in
the fire and wrapped in sago leaves, the sago is called soq6wo. When prepared as porridge, it
is called dau 'sago-porridge'. When prepared in a clay form called porna in Local M alay,
the sago is called saqeraro.
Every step in this harvesting process i s hard work but in ancient times, according to the
story of sago tree, the parrot and the cockatoo (see Appendix 2, Part A , Text 5 ) the whole
process was an easy job: they just pricked a round of holes in the soft sago tree causing the
sago tree (suq6) to fall after which lumps of ready-to-bake sago (suqere) could straightaway
be cut out of the felled tree. The two labor-intensive steps of pounding and kneading were
not needed then. The cockatoo, after a violent argument with the red parrot, i ntroduced the
pounding and the k neading of the sago and thus made life much harder for the I nanwatan
people.
The sago palm is also used for many other things the I nanwatan need. The sago leaves
(qero 'sago leaf; arrow'; qerero 'sago leaves; roof') are used to make arrows and roofs. The
ribs of the sago leaves (tfto 'sago rib; wal l ') are used for the walls of houses (Indonesian
gaba -ga ba ). The bark of woodened sago ribs is used to make floor mats (qipairo). The
young sago leaves are used to make skirts (qardbeqo) for the women. These skirts are used
when traditional dances are performed.","[29, 30]"

"30Chapter 3The bound forms occur only in the first and second person. When possession is not
expressed on inalienably possessed nouns, third person possessors are understood, that is
m iro means 'her belly' (3 . 1 4). I n other words, inalienable nouns have either a possessive
prefix (first and second person) or imply third person possessors.
(3. 1 3)No.-wirime-tutu-rita-bi.my-belly.M 3.S-hurt-DUR-M
My belly is hurting. (I (male) have pain in my belly).
(3. 1 4)Mirome-tutu-rita .belly.F 3.S-hurt-DUR
Her belly is hurting. (She has pain in her belly).
A lthough informants used the bound forms consistently with inalienable nouns in direct
elicitation, in the texts I found free possessive pronouns with k inship terms:

demonstratives, adjectives and verbs and the system works along the same lines. Again, front
vowels are associated with masculine and non-front vowels with feminine gender:
(29)Einogo?a/dau?a nasi-omo.house this.F/that.F good-F
This/that house is good.
(30)Rabfni dcii?anasi-to.that.M good-M
man
That man is good.
(3 1 )Rawodciu?anasi-omo.woman that.F good-F
That woman is attractive.
(32)Mo-(3a-mai.come-FUT-3SG.M
He will come.
(33)Mo-(3a-mao.come-FUT-3SG.F
She will come.
Whereas in Kokoda and I nanwatan gender has a semantic basis in animate nouns only (male
versus female referents), in Puragi (as in Tehit, Flassy 1 99 1 ) the vowel opposition front
versus non-front is used in animate nouns to distinguish male from female referents (30/3 1 )
and in (at least some) inanimate nouns to distinguish small from big referents, (34/35):1 42Appendix 3(34 )amepuri
amepurowind
strong wind(35)beqani
beqanostone
big stoneNouns distinguish number, with the plural expressed by lui replacing the stem final vowel
of the singular. A number of nouns have irregular plurals:

einu murohouse
many houses(37)raga
rago
rorogamale dog
female dog
dogs(38)rah[ni moq6nada
rawo moqanado
rabin u arweone man
one woman
many people2.5.3 VerbsPuragi verbs consist of a verb stem followed by a tense or mood marker and a personl
number(/gender) slot. The Past marker is -ra with - da after i-stems (cf. Kokoda and
I nanwatan cognate Past markers with their a llophones). Gender (M/F) is expressed in 3 SG
forms. The person-number markers of Past and Present are the same.
