"ยง113. Personal Pronouns
They practically always appear before the verb, the pronominal
subject preceding the object. There are however a number of verbs
generally followed by the pronoun and in certain constructions this
order seems to be preferred:
tco'el' a ya'omi, I'm almost dead.
tcose""a ac*a, I'm sick, grandfather.
ika'lica, it hurts me.
i'hu te'metsela'li haci""a, fall on my head, I should say.",[151]
"[Vol. 27fact that the main accent is almost always on the verb-stem. There is
one point, however, in this connection, of extreme importance. The
vowels of the prefixes me- (local), tc*a- and, to a lesser extent, pa-, te(local), ho- (local) and na- (local), vary considerably. We find, for
instance, me-, ma-, mo-, ma-, mu-, me-; tc-a-, tc-o-, tc u-, tc e-; pa-,
pa-; te-, to-, tu-; ho-, hu-, ha-; na-, no-; and, at times, such forms as
ha'a-, ma'a-, ta',-, na'a-. As we know that many Wappo verbs began
with initial vowel, it would be most natural to interpret most of these
mutations as due to the influence of this vowel, now lost in numerous
cases. Such an interpretation would not, however, explain why piand na- (mouth) are not affected and why the prefixes show such marked
differences in the nature of their vowel changes. Clearly a supplementary hypothesis must be added, and to me the most likely one and that
suggested by certain semantic differentiations is that, in some instances,
phonetically identical prefixes are quite unrelated, and that in other
cases, we are dealing with slight shades of meaning indicated by vowelablaut. That there are a number of utterly unrelated ma- (local) and
te- (local) prefixes we know, and that me-, me- (with the hand), possibly pa-, pa- (together), represent slight changes in meaning, is extremely likely. Whether, however, the whole range tca-, tc-o-, tc u-,
tc e-, for instance, implies four gradations in significance is, nevertheless,
quite unlikely.
In short it seems extremely likely that the three factors mentioned
above have all been operative in the development of the vowel ablaut
of prefixes, although owing to confusion of homonyms with each other
and the influence of analogy it is well-nigh impossible, in many instances, to determine which of the three has been operative in any
given case. I am inclined to believe that phonetically irregular fusion
of prefix with initial stem-vowel has been the most, and semantic vowel
mutation the least, frequent cause for the mutation.
As we might expect, a definite order is observable in the position
of the prefixes to which there is no exception. This order is of considerable significance for the history of prefixation in Wappo in that it
suggests that the nearer we approach to the verb-stem the older the
particular prefix is likely to be. It is moreover of some value in the
interpretation of certain prefixes whose meaning and force is vague.
For instance te-, often used with the imperative, loses a good deal of
its uncertainty in meaning when it can be shown to occupy the same
position as the pronominal elements, for then its explanation as a
specialized aspect of te- (Latin eius) seems fairly well fixed. Similarly
whatever doubts may have existed as to the age of na- (with the1929]Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language29mouth), is dissipated when it is seen that it belongs to the group me(with the hand), pe- (with the foot). At the same time our attitude
toward hu-, head (cf. above) is reinforced when we find it grouped
with me- (instrumental), and not with omi-, hLn-, etc.
The prefixes appear in the following order:
First position: te- (eius), me- (suus), mai'-, ho- (it), ma- (it), on-.
Second position: hLn-, o'mi-, ho- (begin), wil-, ku-, te- (come).
Third position: tc-a-.
Fourth position: ma-, me-, mo-, mu- (all local), pa-, pa-, te-, te(local), na- (local).
Fifth position: me- (with hand), na- (with mouth), pe- (with foot),
wi- (general instrumrentality), hu- (head), cu-.
Sixth position: na- (idiomatic), pi-, pv- (?).
The place held by the pronominal prefixes is significant. There are
two such groups, the possessive-reflexive (te-, me-, mai'-) and the pronominal objects (ma-, ho-, on-). te- always precedes me-. The former
group always precede the latter, and this suggests that the verb is
apparently conceived of as a noun. In the discussion on syntax we
shall know that in narratives it is treated as a semi-nominalized construction, a possessed object, and that te-, me-, and mai'- also have
the force of relative pronouns. This is apparently an old type of construction in Yukian for Kroeber seems to imply it in what he says of
Yuki proper.'6
ma- and ho- had perhaps best be interpreted as old proclitic variants of demonstratives ma- from *me, this, and ho- from he-, the first
set probably not related to the possessive me-. Their development into
prefixes I regard as most certainly due to the nominalizing influence
of te-, me-, and mai'-, and is not at all to be ascribed to any tendency
toward fusion between ho- and ma- and the verb-stem itself. In other
words these prefixes are not of the same order as the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth position elements.
on- is undoubtedly a recent development and shows quite nicely
how te- etc., welded all the elements that came after it into a more or
less indissoluble phonetic unit. This must have been largely encouraged
by the comparative phonetic- weakness of on- as contrasted with its
original form of ani, the -i of which was apparently.felt as a subjective
case, thus leading to its irregular loss in order to form the objective.

BYPAUL RADININTRODUCTIONThe languages of the American Indians have been studied for so
long from one definite viewpoint in America that a few words of
justification must preface any attempt, such as the following, that
deviates in many respects from the customary method. About the
merits of the approach of Boas, Goddard, Michelson, etc., no words
are necessary. To seek to describe a language in terms of its specific
structure with complete disregard, for the time being, of all historical
and genetic problems is a necessary preliminary condition for any
adequate linguistic study. No penetration into the genius of a language
is possible without it, and certainly one of the most justifiable criticisms
that can be leveled against the studies on primitive linguistics made by
many philologists and ethnologists is that they have neglected this
type of presentation and permitted themselves to be completely dominated by purely genetic problems. Quite a number of philologists
(when discussing primitive languages) have been content to accept as
completely adequate and as definitely proved that particular method
of approach which under the name of the ""Jung-Grammatiker"" has
dominated linguistic research in Indo-European and Semitic languages for almost two generations. We do not wish seriously to
criticize this method, but we must regard it as a somewhat unnecessarily non-critical attitude to assume that a method, developed in
connection with a group of special languages, has, of necessity, a universal validity. The leaders of the movement, Brugmann and Delbriick,
made no such claims. All the value that might have accrued to the
general study of linguistics from an unbiased consideration of such
* In
justice to the author it should be recorded that this monograph was
completed by him in June, 1922. It was submitted to the University Editorial
Committee for preliminary inspection in 1923, and on their advice abridged by
omission of an English-Wappo vocabulary and other passages, and further condensed through conversion of many tabular lists of examples into solid text paragraphs, in order to reduce cost of publication. This necessitated recopying; the
author lived abroad for a number of years; and it was not until 1928 that it was
possible, through the aid of the Committee on Research in Indian Languages,
Franz Boas chairman, to have a final typescript copy made and verified by the
author.-EDS.","[9, 10]"

"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language21ยง15. ClassiJication
As mentioned before verbs use no suffixes or prefixes to indicate
the character of the object, employing for this purpose, whenever they
wish to express it, either distinct stems or, rarely, ablauted forms.
The same holds true for the noun and pronoun except that very
recently, probably, a classification of nouns into human and nonhuman has developed, the former being indicated by k-a-, a variant
form of the word for man, k-eo. A suffix indicating female gender is
found with certain relationship terms.
ยง16. iAumber
Most verbs do not today, except in the imperative, indicate plurality.
Some do however, either by means of suffixes (-te-, -1-) or by irregular
formations. In the imperative there is a true plural and probably a
dual. There can be no question but that Wappo formerly expressed
plurality in the verb very generally and it is more than probable that
it distinguished between singular and plural subject and object.
All nouns without exception express plurality by the suffix -te,
relationship terms often taking a reduplicated -tE (-tete).
All pronouns express plurality but not by the same suffix as nouns.
The demonstratives indicate both plurality and duality.
A number of verbs, two adjectives, and the relative pronoun indicate plurality by complete change of stem.","[29, 30]"
"[Vol. 27The impression conveyed by most of the sketches in the Handbook of
American Indian Languages is that they are indeed regarded as such
ultimate classifications. Many of the inferences of Boas, Goddard,
etc., point in the same direction. In short, there is an absence of historical perspective. In the second place, the method suffers from a
failure to appreciate exactly how iconoclastic it really is and it fails in
this regard just because it has divorced itself from all relation to the
older method as applied to the investigation of Indo-European languages.
At first blush it is somewhat difficult to understand how a grouping
of grammatical categories found at a given time should be regarded as
representing a grouping that is supposed to be, in all fundamentals,
the original or quasi-original one for a given language. Tremendous
changes must certainly be conceded for a cultural phenomenon like
language. And this apparent attitude is all the more difficult to fathom
when we are told that ""our aim is to unravel the history of the growth
of human language and, if possible, to discover its underlying and
physiological causes.""6 In order to do so is it necessary to treat the
grammatical system of a language as though it had always been the
same, had never changed? Above all, to hold such a view is it essential
to regard those features, that a descriptive presentation has shown to
be the most specific, as precisely the traits that have exhibited the most
stability? Yet I do not believe that it is unfair to state that this is
exactly what these philologists have done.
It is quite apparent, however, that the basis of the method of the
authors of the Handbook of American Indian Languages (Sapir and
Thalbitzer excepted), rests on a foundation entirely different from the
customary one. We cannot here enter into the proofs of our.contention,
but it does seem abundantly clear that a definite hypothesis lies at
the bottom of the somewhat strange interpretation of the linguistic
facts of one specific period, namely, the theory of multiple origin of
the languages of America, this in turn being but an illustration of the
general proposition that linguistic categories are of multiple origin.
Viewed from this angle their whole attitude is intelligible. This hypothesis, is from the nature of the case, one with which the students of
Indo-European languages, dealing with idioms belonging to one common
stock, would have little concern. Their whole method (at least that
of the Jung-Grammatiker) is to show how diversification has developed
from original unity. Thus here too the American school is, in spirit,
fundamentally opposed to the students of the western European
tongues.

"[Vol. 27Then we have in addition an old causative no longer functional -a, -ha'
and perhaps a still older one, the petrified suffix -k. We might also
point out that this continuous development of causatives bespeaks the
existence of an old tendency of this type. There iq even a farther evolution in Wappo for we find today the verb tcuti, to order, on the point
of developing into a postposition with causative significance.
If therefore stem-composition seems to play a meagre r6le, may we
not ascribe this to the ease with which verbs of motion and causation
were absorbed into a general periphrastic scheme that quickly deprived
such verbs of specific meaning? We shall see later how the tendency
to nominalize verbs tended likewise to prevent stem-composition.
Little need be said about the order in which suffixes follow each
other. There are seven positions:
First position: petrified suffixes.
Second position: verb-base vowels.
Third position: -k- (unknown), -s-, -c-, -4 passive, -1 continuative.
Fourth position: increments (-te-, -4e, -lek, -mak, subjunctives,
causatives).
Fifth position: -k- inferential.
Sixth position: tense-aspect, imperative.
Seventh position: subordinating, nominalizing.
As the vast majority of suffixes are connected with tense, mode,
and aspect formation they will be discussed more fully in the sections
devoted to these subjects (ยง65-80).
ยง35. PetHfied SuffixesA fairly large number of suffixes, for the most part no longer or
only sporadically functional, are found fused with verb-stems. In many
cases their meaning can no longer be determined with any exactness,
if at all. That we are dealing with true suffixes and not secondarily
interpreted terminal consonants, the examples clearly testify. Some
of them correspond to suffixes still functional in Yuki.

"1929]1adin: A Grammar of the Wappo L4nguage71To bring order into this maze of forms is not easy. Since the phonetic
variations of the stem are due as much, if not more, to morphological
considerations they should logically be treated together with the
formation of tense, mode, voice, aspect. But this would result in a
rather cumbrous and highly artificial arrangement. We have therefore
decided to discuss the whole problem here phonetically, and since it is
impossible to determine the verb-stem with any degree of exactness,
to make our groupings dependent upon the relation of the futurepreterit to the indefinite stem. In those cases where the preterit does
not coincide with the future, special mention will be made in the
respeStive sections.
Only the principal types are given. Since the arrangement is confessedly artificial and definitely circumscribed by our basis of comparison, some of the minor variations of the latter will not be given.
They will however be found in the preceding section on Verb Bases.
In the table that follows, c = consonant, v = vowel, v =diphthong,
v' = accented vowel, v'= aspirated vowel, and v'= mutated vowel. The
other letters have their literal meaning.","[79, 80]"
"The above classification into seventeen types is one based on phonetic
considerations. In order to understand fully the irregularities of the
verb, another grouping is necessary, one based on the specific suffix
used in the formation of the indefinite tense-aspect; and to this we
shall now turn.
ยงยง54-64. CLASSESยง54. Introduction
Wappo may be said to have eight, strictly speaking only six, conjugations or classes. While in one way any arrangement into classes is
artificial, in another it seems to correspond to the historical fact that
each independent tense-aspect was correlated with a different method
of forming the future-past. Today this still holds for four of the groups.
The original eight classes were probably the following:
Indefinite

-kiToday 2 has become merged with 1; the future-past of 3 has lost
special association with any particular indefinite suffix; 5 and 7 have,
for the main part, become fused with 6 and 1; and the -ma indefinite
of 4 has given place to -ya. We have thus really left four classes:
1. thematic vowel, -mi; -Si; -ta, -ki.
2. -ce, -ca, -ee; -tesi; -tcki.
3. -ya;m-ksi;-mkkta.
4. -ki; -8i; -ki.",[94]
"1929]Radin: A Grainar of the Wappo Latnguage93ยง64. Verbs with Double Forms for Tenses, etc.
Forming a class by themselves are a number of verbs that allow
of more than one method of forming the different tense-aspects and
imperative. Extreme irregularity exists here and the various doublets
require separate explanations. That the same verb should have both
-ki and -ta in the past is merely the persistence of a trait that at one
time all verbs shared. That however a verb should have two ways of
forming the singular imperative, that the indefinite should end in both
a vowel and -mi, is a morphological phenomenon of an entirely different
order. That, finally, the same verbs should possess a simple and an
increment future and past, can be explained either on the assumption
that they have preserved an old characteristic once common to all
verbs, or that the increment forms are being displaced by the simple
ones.
As we have evidence (sometimes unfortunately not quite clear),
indicating the former existence and present persistence of two forms
for each tense-aspect-a responsive and a direct-we must try to
separate these from the others. As far as could be ascertained these
are -ta direct-past, -ki responsive past; -si direct future, -yaomi and
possibly -1- increments, responsive futures. For the independent tenseaspect no difference exists. Barring these, the doublets are to be interpreted as secondary extensions of one or the other suffix and as representing the first stages of the displacement of one by the other. Where
-ti and -e imperative exist, -ti is the secondary extension; where -mi
and thematic vowel indefinite are found, -mi is secondary; where -mi
and -cc, -se or -ya are encountered in the indefinite the latter are secondary; where increment and non-increment forms exist side by side
(-lek- and -mak- excluded), the former are primary.

"ยง13. Predicating Concepts
Wappo, and Yukian in general, is built up around the verb. In form
it is both monosyllabic and polysyllabic. The monosyllabic stem
appears as v+c (rare), c+v, and c+v+c. The last two are fairly
common. The polysyllabic stem is either v+c+v+c (rare) or c+v
+c+v and c+v+c+v+c. The second is probably the prevailing type
in the language, the c+v+c+v+c type although not rare being clearly
secondary in origin.
The stem consists essentially of two elements, the base and a
formative suffix. Many verbs, however, also appear with a prefix1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language19forming so integral a part of it that it seems best to think of two stems,
:(a) base+formative element and (b) prefix+base+formative element.
As seen today the base or root is rather colorless, the formative element
fixing it, so to speak, in aspect, voice, mode, and time and the suffixes
and prefixes elucidating it more definitely in direction and position.
The grammatical and semantic discussions that follow will, however,
make it fairly evident that this colorlessness of the base is not original
and that it had a much more concrete significance at one time. In
this earlier stage the base, which probably had no formative elements
in the sense in which they exist today, expressed shape, number of
subject and object, and aspect. It has preserved the first in a fair
number of verbs, the second vestigially, and has transferred the function of the last to a large number of prefixes and suffixes.
Today the typical stem consists of a prefix implying indefinite
subject or object; the base; the formative, and a suffix indicating some
kind of aspect. Almost as frequent, however, is the type consisting of
pronominal prefix indicating the relation of the subject of the verb to
that of the preceding sentence, plus adverbial or instrumental prefix,
plus stem, etc.
At no time apparently, now or previously, have suffixes been used
to indicate shape and position in the manner of Siouan. Plurality and
distribution, however, were and still are so indicated.
The lack of concrete significance of the base, a trait that must,
in spite of its probable secondary origin, be regarded as extremely
old, has resulted in converting the verb into a kind of neutral stem.
It even may be claimed that the verb-stem is formed by the addition
of certain verb-formatives to a neutral base, even if historically we
shall have to admit that the neutral stem merely represents a degenerate verb-base. Only such an interpretation can explain why today
everything can be verbalized: adjective, noun, adverb, etc. It is
likewise probably only this colorlessness that has enabled the verb-stem
to fall so easily a prey to the general process of nominalization to which
it is now being subjected. That neutral stems once existed however
it would be unnecessarily pedantic to deny. There are, in fact, a number
of nouns and verbs where it is well-nigh impossible to tell whether the
predicating or denominating concept is more original:
pe, foot; poi, kick; pe-k, to track; -tv-, water and all activities of water; o'kEl,word; oka'li, talk; hucb'lak, hole, omo-ci'li, make holes.
Are these verbalized nouns or nominalized verbs? poi can conceivably be translated as intensively-footing-it and pek, footing-it; but
oka'li, wording-it and omoci'li, holding-it is not very likely, and if20University of California Publications in Aim. Arch. and Ethn.","[27, 28, 29]"
"1929]Radin: A Gra'mmar of the Wappo Language3.... it may safely be stated from what we know [i.e., of a given language at
one stage of its history], that phonetic traits often belong to languages which are
morphologically entirely distinct .....
*. .. their [areas of definite types of morphological characterization-reduplication, incorporation, instrumental cases-distribution do not coincide.
word categories which appear in neighboring languages are sometimes
quite similar.
.... areas of distribution of phonetic phenomena, of morphological characteristics, and of groups based on similarities in vocabularies .... do not coincide.
.... phonetic influences [without other influences] do spread from one people
to another.
It is not so easy to understand the development of similar categories of words
in neighboring languages ... . Equally difficult to understand is the spread
of morphological traits from one language to another [e.g., second third person
in Kutenai and Algonkin].
.... it would be entirely unwarranted to claim that all similarities of phonetics, classification of concepts, or of morphology must be due to borrowing. On
the contrary, their distribution shows that they must be considered as due to
psychological causes such as the unavoidable necessity of classification of experience in speech, which can lead to a limited number of categories only, or the
physiological possibilities of articulation, that also limit the range of possible
sounds which are sufficiently distinct to the ear for clear understanding.
If these observations regarding the influence of acculturation upon language
should be correct, then the whole history of American languages must not be
treated on the assumption that all languages which show similarities must be
considered as branches of the same linguistic family ..... We should have to
reckon with the tendency of languages to absorb so many foreign traits, that we
can no longer speak of a single origin, and that it would be arbitrary whether we
associate a language with one or the other of the contributing stocks.
[In proving relationship of certain languages] The question would remain
to be answered, why there should be such fundamental dissimilarities between by
far the larger number of words [he is speaking of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Haida],
and the question should still be asked how these dissimilarities are to be explained.","[11, 12]"

"ยง21. Direction and Instrumentality
Direction is expressed in verbs by a large number of prefixes (in,
on, at, down, up, near, etc.) and in the noun by suffixes. Instrumentality is quite important in both verb and noun. In the former it is
expressed by prefixes (with hand, foot, head, mouth, etc.), in the latter
by suffixes (with, for, by, from). The verb likewise occurs with many
nominal instrumental prefixes.
ยง22. Person
The personal and possessive pronouns have a singular and plural,
possibly a dual. The plural is simply the singular with plural suffix.
Subjective and objective forms are distinguished, the former changing
terminal vowel to -i; the latter being characterized by the stem. To
this there are in the personal series, three exceptions; the third singular
subjective tse (demonstrative in origin), the objective singular te-, and
the objective plural on. The third plural personal (oni, on) is an old
noun meaning people.
The possessive pronouns distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession by means of prefixes. The reflexive is formed by prefixing mai-.
ยง23. Syntactic Relations
Position plays a relatively small place in Wappo, most of the
syntactical relations being expressed by suffixes, prefixes, and particles
(post-positions). A subjective, objective, and vocative case occurs in
the noun. The relation of the subject of the verb to that of the verb1929]Badiin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language223of the preceding sentence is very clearly indicated in what is one of
the fundamental traits of the language. Coordination and subordination are expressed by the postpositive particles. The subject of a
subordinate clause, if pronominal, is generally in the objective case.

"1929]Radin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language7PART I. GRAMMAR
ยง1. HABITAT AND STATUS OF WAPPOWappo, one of the languages of the Yukian stock of which the
other members are Yuki proper, Coast Yuki, and Huchnom, is spoken
today by a mere handful of people. Indeed it is doubtful whether,
when the material for this grammar was obtained (1917), there were
more than twenty individuals who spoke it correctly and certainly
only one, Jim Tripo, now deceased, who had any extensive knowledge
of the old mythology. According to some informants Wappo was
spoken in a number of sub-dialects but these seem to have varied
only in details of vocabulary.
Practically all the Wappo are supposed to live at Alexander Valley,
Sonoma county, California, a few miles distant from Healdsburg,
although as a matter of fact only a few families live there, the majority
spending most of their time in the various settlements near Healdsburg
and Cloverdale.
The Wappo, at one time, occupied two small and entirely disconnected areas, both of them quite separated from their kindred, the
Yuki. The first one lay in Napa and Sonoma counties and the other,
much smaller, at the southern end of Lake county.7
The first or main Wappo area is surrounded by that of the Southern
Pomo, Northern Miwok, and Southern Wintun (Patwin), the second
by the Southeastern and Eastern Pomo. Yet in spite of this contiguity
practically no specific linguistic borrowing has taken place between
the Wappo and their neighbors, the resemblances that exist being of
such a kind as to point not to secondary borrowing but to old genetic
relationship.
The language as spoken today contains only a handful of Spanish
words in spite of the strong missionary influence to which it was subjected. In several tales of Spanish origin, which in addition are probably
translations from that language into Wappo, a number of loan-words
were encountered. In the other myths and texts transcribed, none
were found.

"1929]BadcA: A G-rammar of the Wappo LanIuage73In general then it may be said that the absence of the increments
(-te, -4, -le[k], -ma[k]) in the indefinite is secondary and that they lost
them subsequently, just as they lost certain vowels. Two of the aspect
suffixes, -sv and -cv, are still found frequently fused to the indefinite
stem, and it is this fact that makes types 15 and 16 so rare.
With regard to the third type of change, the shift of accent in the
future, this is definitely phonetic in origin and represents a type of
change that was extended in order to avoid confusion with the indefinite which in all these cases ends in -sv. We shall see in the discussion
of the future tense that three methods were adopted to prevent the
future and indefinite of certain verbs from falling together; the one
mentioned above, the use of -yaomi instead of -si, and the use of the
hortatory -asi instead of the regular -esi. I am inclined to believe
that -e'si (shifted accent) is the oldest, and that it in reality does not
at all represent a shifting of accent but a preservation of an original
pitch accent. A satisfactory proof unfortunately cannot be given. At
any rate we are in this instance concerned with a purely phonetic
change that became significant and was extended because it served a
definite morphological function.
We shall now turn to a discussion of the different types.
Type 1.-Fully fifty per cent of the verbs belong to this type. All
the following stem forms are found: c+v, c+vv, c+v+c, c+v+c+v,
v+v, v+c+v.

found prevailingly with -cv and -sv indefinites, occasionally with -mi.

"[Vol. 27The second position elements need not detain us. They are strictly
speaking proclitics whose fusion with the verb is being accelerated by
the force of first position te-, me-, mai'-.
The third and fourth position elements are all adverbial, unrelated
to any stems existing in Wappo today and clearly among the oldest
prefixes in the language. It is with these that the composite verb unit
can be said to begin, for the first and second position elements give the
impression of being partially proclitic. ttemewilts'awil, she fondled him,
has the feeling of temewil ts'awil, a possessed noun followed by a verb.
This seemingly proclitic force of the first position elements when preceding the second position elements is however quite secondary. From
the nature of the case the local prefixes in third and fourth position
only occurred with verb-stems and they thus resisted any secondary
disintegrating tendency. They were protected, we may hazard to
believe, from developing secondarily into nominal suffixes by their
position after the possessive pronominal elements. It is true that they
precede the instrumentals (me-, 'pe, na-, wi-) but these latter are only
vaguely regarded as nouns and are so intimately associated with the
verb activity that a separation from the verb-stem proper and a grouping
with the third and fourth position elements would be felt as quite
preposterous. For instance, oniapiwa'tasi, he-stamped-with-the-foot,
could never split up into omapi and watasi.
Two of the fifth position elements are non-instrumental, cu- and
hu-, and require some explanation. The verbs with these prefixes can
best be interpreted as old composita whose prefixed element is beginning
to be felt as adverbial and as detachable. This is at least the case for
cu- and explains why it is separated from the stem when pi- (near),
na- (idiomatic), and pv- (by sucking) are used. In other words as soon
as cu- was felt as an adverb it took the position occupied by adverbial
prefixes in the composite verb. hu- apparently has not yet reached
that stage.
In the fifth position, with two exceptions, we have only instrumentals. They are all slight variants of nouns still extensively used. Their
instrumental function is quite clear and they are rarely treated as noun
subjects or objects. In origin they must certainly have been of the
type still largely exemplified by hu-, but their transformation into
instrumentals belongs to an old period of the language.
1. cu-, to follow, after, back, off.
This prefix seems an excellent example both of an old compound
and of a verb-base in the process of decay. We meet it as an independent' verb-stem, as a semi-independent adverb, and as a true ad-1929]'Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language31verbial prefix. Its function as a prefix is probably quite recent for it is
found only with certain verbs. But as an incorporated verb it is quite
old. It is however fairly rapidly coming into more extensive use as
an adverbial prefix and seems, at the same time, to be developing into
a nominal suffix.
ancu'wi, he followed them; mai'cu""u mak'u'uki', he ran back (literally,
himself-back he ran).","[39, 40]"
"ยง68. Formation of the Future
There are two futures in Wappo, a simple and a periphrastic,
respectively -si and -yaomi. Every verb in the lan'guage can practically use both forms although a few occur with -yaomi only. This
latter is clearly composed of three elements -ya- (old verb ""to go""),
-o- probably an old formative possibly related to petrified suffix -wv
(cf. ยง35), and -mi indefinite tense. It is, in other words, the indefinite
form of *ya, to go, and means he-is-to-go. Both -si and -yaomi are
unknown to Yuki proper, the futures in that language being- -pa and.",[109]
"[Vol. 27ยง28. Complete Stem-Differentiation
It is quite erroneous, I believe, to dismiss complete stem-differentiation to the limbo of the vocabulary. It is far better to regard it as
a distinct process. In a language where the initial consonant, the basic
stem vowel, and the terminal stem vowel can be altered, what appears
to be complete stem-differentiation might, very well, have not been
that in origin. However there can be little doubt that in the vast
majority of cases, where different stems are found for singular and
plural, for round and for long objects, etc., these are all quite unrelated
and due to idiomatic crystallizations, etc. In Wappo the distinction
between singular and plural is expressed by completely unrelated stems
not only for verbs, but for a few adjectives and occasionally for the
relative pronoun. The classification of activities in relation to round,
long, and short objects, to singular and plural, etc., is largely accomplished by the same means.",[35]

ยง89. The Nominal Stem
The nominal stem forms a much simpler unit than that of the verb.
Like the latter it consists of a stem with prefixes and suffixes. The
prefixes are, however, few in number. With the exception of the pronominal possessive there are only three very sparingly used formatives.
True suffixes are on the whole scarce, being either old formatives or
expressing case relations.
In addition to prefixation and suffixation the only processes used
extensively are a loose type of stem-composition, sporadic reduplication
(only with onomatopoeic words), and a few instances of stem-differentiation for singular and plural. Vocalic ablaut either basic or terminal
is absent, although a few nominal bases differ from related verbal ones
by vowel alternations. This appears, however, secondary and unimportant and is unconnected with the old fundamental vocalic mutation
of the verbal bases.
ยงยง90-91. PREFIXATIONยง90. Introduction
Prefixation is apparently an old process in nouns and one that is
still exhibiting considerable strength. The noun-formatives ma-, ho-,
na- and the possessive prefixes me-, te-, -mesa, to which must be added
the vestigial hai-, hu-, and the reflexive mai-, are among the oldest in
the language, while k-a-, human, te- plural? -demonstrative, and onplural are certainly very recent additions. It seems today as if the
same tendency that has led te- demonstrative to develop into a prefix
is extending to other demonstratives (tse, he) and converting them into
prefixed articles. In one word this has already taken place, tse'hasi,
old man (literally, the old-one). The vigor of this drift is possibly
only one aspect of nominal stem-composition, a process that shows no
indication of abating.
ma-, ho-, na- are apparently old demonstratives, ma- non-existent
today, ho, a variant of he, and na- non-existent today but perhaps
identical with ne- in ne-wela, inside. All three are generally connected
with nominalized verb or neutral stems.","[129, 130]"
"1929]Badin: A Grammar of the Wappo Language135However as the objective personal pronominal forms are also used
as the possessive the foregoing usage has become merged in an idiomatic
construction which consists in employing the possessive forms in indirect
discourse and other subordinate sentences. In origin this is simply the
persistence of the use of the objective form as the subject of the verb
in subordinate clauses, mentioned above. The Yuki idiom of putting
the object of certain transitive verbs in the possessive is clearly identical.48 There, however, the possessive suffix appears with the pronoun,
which is not the case in Wappo.
The question of the relation of the Yukian pronominal system is
too large to enter upon here. It shows marked affinities with the
Hokan series in spite of considerable divergence of detail.
ยง101. Possessive PronounThe regular possessive pronoun is simply the objective series of
the personal pronoun with a few changes. It appears however in two
forms, one with and one without the possessive suffix -me, the first
used with relationship terms and body-part nouns to indicate inalienable possession and the second with all other nouns to indicate alienable
possession. The second series can however be employed with body-part
nouns when they specifically express separation from the body.
The main difference between the personal and the possessive series
is the use of the old form mesa for the third plural, and the dual ka,
ku with all the plural forms, although tse'kato is also found. The series
follows:
my
your
his
our (dual)
our (plural)
your (dual)
your (plural)
their (dual)
their (plural)Alienable
Inalienable
imeimi'memite'me-, me'mete*isa'kamei'sakai'samei'sa*mi'sakamcmi'sakami'samemi'same'sakame
me'sakame'sa-, tsek&'tame
me'sa-, tseko'to
*(me'same, not found)Phonetically all these forms are proclitics, but in the singular the
fusion with the stem seems much closer.
1. Alienable possession.
i'memetai', my wife; i'melel, my rock; imetcu'itcu, my dog; imeme'tse, my
arrow; mimetcu'itcu, your dog; temetcu'itcu, his dog.
48 This series, 9:371-372.","[143, 144]"
"Possessive -me has, we have seen, become a general nominal possessive (cf. ยง93).
There are a few sporadic indications of an older series to which
some weight should be attached. pe""u, penis, was found in the form
haipe""u, my penis, and when this is compared with mai' reflexive
pronoun frequently used as inalienable possessive third person one
gets the impression of a series. *hai-, first person, *mai', third person,
which might be analyzed into ha, I, ma-, indefinite object, and *i
possessive for inalienable possession to be contrasted with -me.
An exceedingly important special use of the third person inalienable
and alienable (te-, meme-) in the sense of Latin eius and suus runs
through the whole language (cf. ยง32).
Apparently Wappo as compared with Yuki proper has developed
its possessive suffix independently, the former from an old demonstrative ma, used today as indefinite verbal object, and the latter from
the demonstrative te still found in both languages.",[145]

"2[Vol. 27new and particular data as that presented by primitive languages, was
thus almost completely lost and primitive idioms became merely new
sources for illustrating the results obtained in the realm of IndoEuropean linguistics.
In America a complete, or almost complete, diVorce from the work
of the great philologists of Europe produced precisely the opposite
result. The two cardinal dogmas of the Jung-Grammatiker, that
phonetic changes are unconscious and without exception and that
analogy plays a tremendous r6le in all languages, are either entirely
neglected or only incidentally treated. This freedom from the restraint
of the classical school of philologists is of the greatest importance and
significance. It enabled Kroeber in his study of Yokuts boldly and
bluntly to deny the first (and most fundamental) dogma of BrugmannLeskien that phonetic changes are without exception. He says:'
The rules for the change of the verb-stem do not apply at all to the noun.
The addition, to certain stems, of one and the same suffix to indicate both the
objective and plural has quite different effects on the stem-vowel according to
the significance of the suffix ... . The vocalic mutations in the language can
therefore not be regarded as due to a single complex system of harmony which is
always equally operative and differs in its results only through dissimilarity of
circumstances. It is evident that there exists a general tendency toward vocalic
harmony which takes form differently not only according to phonetic influences
but in accord with logical differences such as the grammatical categories and the
distinctions of the parts of speech. The Yokuts vocalic system thus is arbitrary
rather than phonetically automatic and appears to be influenced as much by impulses
to express linguistic forms as by purely physiological habits.2In another place he says of Yokuts:
In other words an abstract grammatical distinction entirely suspends and
again sets in operation (a) concrete and physical phonetic law.3Such a new outlook is not only healthy but necessary if progress is
to be made. I personally believe Kroeber is not right and that his
method of procedure-namely, to claim that we do not have to go
beyond what we actually have knowledge of (in this case one or two
dialects of Yokuts of one particular time)4-is, to my mind, not only
non-historical but needlessly iconoclastic.
This same spirit of detachment from entangling alliances with the
results of Indo-European linguistic researches is found in all the utterances of Boas. In one of his last statements he presents his conclusions
as follows:5

"All the above forms either end in functional aspect suffixes (-c, -1)
or in petrified suffixes (-n, -p); the latter however are rare. Are we to
regard these forms, in consequence, as merely special developments
of c+v formula or as verbs that have lost terminal vowel? The future
has a weak vowel but all futures have such a vowel and in many cases
it is inorganic. Having due regard to the meaning of the verbs of this
class which is often strictly comparable to stems of c+v formula, they
can be best understood as variants of c+v stem.
All these verbs seem to take their indefinite in -mi. This may be
due to the fact that indefinites in sv and -cv would merge with final
-s and -c and would tend to develop a weak inorganic vowel after
final -1, -n. On the other hand, -mi may have been preferred in order
to prevent the confusion that would have resulted between the indefinite and the future had -sv or -cv been frequently suffixed. Some such
phonetic-morphological reason has probably been at work, for the
significance of the verbs themselves would not account for the preference of -mi.

number, however, probably many are historically secondary in origin,
consisting of an old monosyllabic stem (c+v) with the addition either
of a petrified aspect suffix or of an aspect suffix still functional. The
former, on the whole, decidedly predominate so that whatever may
have been their ultimate origin, they are now felt as integral portions
of the stem. This is further emphasized by the fact that vowels of
various timbre always follow this apparently petrified or functional
suffix and that when the tense-aspect affixes (-mi, -sv, -cv) are added it
is always to the vowels. Of still greater importance is the fact that
practically all the vowel thematic indefinites belong here and when it
is remembered that one-sixth of all the verbs in the language form their
indefinites in -i, whether we regard this -i as the mutated original vowel
or not, we must, for all practical purposes, call it part of the stem. We
may therefore confidently postulate stems of the form c+v+c+v for
a very old period of the language. Some of these, many perhaps, are
of great antiquity but secondary, others belong to the very oldest
strata of Wappo and Yukian, for not all -1, -t, -p, etc., need necessarily
be identical with old petrified or still functional suffixes nor need all -i
represent mutated vowels. The existence of the stem form c+v+c+v
is of far-reaching significance both for a proper understanding of the
Yukian stock and for its relation to other languages and that is why we
have given so much space to proving it.
It is noticeable that very few of these indefinites take -sv or -cv
and also form regular futures and pasts. There are probably not more
than half a dozen in the whole language. The reason is simple enough.
The vast majority of indefinites of the form c+v+c+v have an
irregular future-past, and since the increment future and increment
past stems are connected with aspects, we have here an additional
proof of the definitely felt force of -St and -cv. This incidentally also
indicates that -mi is not any longer felt to possess any meaning except
that of an indefinite tense, an interpretation abundantly borne out
in other ways.

As I understand it the American school of philology has two supreme
virtues: first, it studies primitive languages apart from any philological
preconceptions and presents the grammatical facts descriptively, and
secondly, it constitutes something of a reaction against the excesses of
the Brugmann school. Looking at its method negatively, however, the
American school suffers from two cardinal defects. In the first place it
does not always (if ever) tell us whether or not the descriptive facts

the original types of processes, in fact, the original phonetic system.",[12]

"[Vol. 27Iยง96-98. FORMATION OF CASE
ยง96. IntroductionWappo possesses a large number of syntactical case forms all formed
in the same way, by suffixes. The principal ones are the subjective,
possessive, instrumental, ablative, locative, and a very specialized
vocative. The objective is the stem itself. This latter fact is rather
interesting because in Yuki proper, the suffix, which is the equivalent
of the Wappo subjective, is employed as the objective and the stem is
the subjective. This difference in usage is very interesting and suggests
a secondary development in both dialects.. Wappo throws no light on
the subject but Yuki proper does. There we find an -a as animate of
numerals and adjectives and an -i as inanimate of numerals. The
Wappo subjective is -i, the Yuki proper objective -a. In addition a
large number of Wappo nouns-a larger percentage than can be assumed
on the basis of chance-end in -a. But even more significant, the
normal method of forming the subjective of nominal stems ending in
a vowel, is not to add -i but to have it displace the terminal vowel,
thus suggesting that this -a is not part of the stem.
Now if we look among the adjacent languages we find that a suffixed
vowel is characteristic of the objective in Yokuts, Miwok, Costanoan,
and Northern Maidu. In Yokuts where we have the fullest data it is
-a, -o, and -i. The examples given of -i show that it is used only with
animal names and a few relationship terms.4' A large percentage of
nouns likewise show change of stem for the objective. A glance at
Kroeber's list42 demonstrates that the overwhelming number with a
suffix are names of. animals, body parts, and relationship terms. We
thus have two series, one prevailingly animate, the other inanimate.
In the Hokan group, a true subjective case occurs in Achomawi
and Southwestern Pomo, and probably Pomo in general. In the
former language it has two forms, -ka for masculine and animals and
-waka for all others.43 In Southwestern Pomo it is -ya, to be identified
with Wappo -i, and is prevailingly used with animate' nouns. In
Northern Yana4 no subjective or objective case exists but there is a
differentiation for male and female in the demonstratives and the'
substantial derivatives of verbs, the male form having a vowel and
the female either no vowel or a vestigial one.

excepted.

To the above five should be added the indefinite object of verbs

indefinite object of verbs ho- is probably a variant of he.",[145]
"ยงยง81-88. EXPRESSION OF PLURALITY IN VERBSยง81. Introduction
The expression of plurality in Wappo does not play a role in Wappo
comparable to that which it enjoys in lang,uages like Pomo, Salinan,
and Washo. Indeed it seems, on the whole, unimportant. There are,
however, four methods of forming it, all vestigial, it is true, but still
functional. If we add the plural imperative and the doubtful dual
there are six methods. These are:
1. Stem differentiation
4. -1
2. -c
5. -mi (imperative)
3. -te
6. -ku? (dual)
The importance of these methods lies in the fact that the neighboring
Pomo and Washo (?) possess all of them except -e and that Salinan and
Achomawi have a number of them. Indeed these particular elements
and, in general, an exuberant development of the expression of plurality,
are characteristic of Hokan. It seems not so characteristic of Californian Penutian but appears again in Sapir's extended Penutian
(Tsimshian, Chinook). Pomo shows what must have been the original
meaning of these numerous differentiations. There we find the singularity of the subject and object carefully differentiated from the plurality
of the subject and object, in the first person, the third person, and the
imperative, thus yielding the following scheme:
singular-singular
plural-singular
singular-plural
plural-plural118University of California Publications in Am. Arch. and Ethn.","[126, 127]"
"ยง110. Types of Word-Units
Marked stem-composition of the type so characteristic of Algonkin,
Yana, and even Achomawi is quite unknown. In the verb it is practically
absent except in the case of such auxiliaries as -mak, -ya, etc. There
exist however two types of stem-composition that have given rise to
true word units, the composite nouns illustrated particularly by individual and place names, and the pronominal units.
Individual and place-names.-The stems, noun and verb, are either
simply strung together without any particular fusion, or a nounformative is a,dded.

"ยง41. Plurality
79. -1, -le, plural. What appears to be the continuative suffix is
also found as a true plural in some verbs. Its use in this way is not
uncommon. In all probability it was at one period in the history of
the language far more extensively employed than today. The increments in -1, -4e, and the imperative plurals in -lu-mi distinctly point in
this direction.
nak'te-l-ki, blossoms came out (naka'tki, singular); cute-l-ki, many fires went
out (ocu'ttta, sing.); wtle'-l-ki, they are extended (wt'lki, sing.); tso'ye-l-ki, flat
objects lie (tso'tki, sing.): hote'pe-l-ki, long objects lie (ote'puke, sing.); ne'h%l-ki,
short objects lie (ne'ki, sing.); nata'me-l-ki, they lie on stomach (nata'm-ki, sing.);
no'me-l-ki, they lived (na'mki, sing.); telipa'-l-uki, they were piled up (Qteli'pita,
sing.); ku'he-l-ki, they stand (ku""ki, sing.); ko'yc-l-ki, round empty objects stand

(sutu'ki, sing.): ku'he-l-ki, they stoop (ku""ki, sing.).80. -te, plural. Identical with the iterative suffix. It is not found
commonly in conversational Wappo, but appears quite often in the
texts.
mai'otcai""i-te, they are lying coiled up; ma'l-te, they sweated; tc-ahu'-te-ki,
they came out; tema'n-te, (I) brought them (plural object); mahi'n-te, (how)

19. -i, nominal plural (rare). This suffix is the regular plural in

nouns.

"Subtype S.-These form their parts in -ki. The imperative is uncertain but probably -ti. This -ki today has become associated with
intransitive and neuter verbs, with paives, and with transitives
without object. It is probably for some such reason that -ki has displaced -ta entirely. Verbs like ho'ts'ami, kill, ho'ts*aplmi, break, used
intransitively, either use another verb for the transitive (t'o'ta, he
killed) or a special construction like the causative (hots.a'p&ttsta, he
broke). Not many verbs belong to this group.

turn around.",[98]
"[Vol. 27One of the most important features of the spoken language as
known today is its deviation in certain grammatical details and vocabulary from the language of the texts, at least from that in which all the
myths told by Tripo were couched. My interpreter always referred
to this as the ""high language"" and experienced occasionally some
difficulty in understanding a few of the forms. It is difficult to state
definitely exactly in what the difference lies. This much is clear, however, that in the question of verb irregularities the spoken and written
language are at one. Certain suffixes like the aspects -cele, -mEle, -sElE,
-kElE, the inferential (?) -k-, vowel mutation for subjunctive, etc., are
rarely used in the spoken language, or if used, only with the vaguest
of meanings. On the other hand a number of suffixes with subjunctive
force, rarely if ever encountered with this signification in the texts
(-lEk-, -te-, -ta-, -la-) are widely employed in the present-day conversational speech.
The grammar that follows is based largely on the texts of two individuals, Jim Tripo and Joe McCloud, both men over sixty who spoke
Wappo perfectly. The former, now deceased, had spent many years
of his life among the Eastern Pomo and spoke that language quite
fluently; the latter claimed at one time to have known Spanish better
than Wappo; and there is a possibility that the tales of Spanish origin
dictated by him have been influenced by Spanish idioms.
The texts have been published as ""Wappo Texts"" in volume 19
of this series, in 1924.
A11 the texts obtained were translated by McCloud. He is also
responsible for all the grammatical forms obtained in connection with
them.",[17]
