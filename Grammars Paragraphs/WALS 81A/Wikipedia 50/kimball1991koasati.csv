"Syntaxfollowing discussion covers word order and word order variation,The syntax of a language is usually the most complex topic that
a grammar has to cover; the syntax of Koasati is no exception. Theand disjunctive words, and sentence particles—which are eithergapping, switch-reference marking, verbal conjunction, conjunctiveoperations within a phrase or sentence, those that link sentences
together, or those that operate on the discourse level.
Word OrderThe most unmarked word order of a sentence is subject, object,
verb (SOV). If there is an indirect object and the direct object is
not present in the sentence, the order is subject, indirect object,
verb (SIoV). If both a direct and indirect object are overt, the
order is usually subject, object, verb, indirect object (SOVIo),
although SIoOV can occur (see chap. 13, example 17). If there is
a locative phrase (a noun in one of the locational cases, a noun
followed by a postposition, a locational noun), it follows the verb(SOVLo¢).","[532, 533]"
"Although the above schemata show the most unmarked word
order in the language, because Koasati employs nominal cases, a513the following discussion, wordorder variation involving thesesentence; verbs have no such morphological machinery to convey
focus. Indeed, some of the more unusual word orders in Koasati
seem to be the result of allowing verbs to take primacy over nouns
for various reasons. Although subjects and objects are the focus ofelements can result as much from linguistic attention on the verb as
from a real change in a noun’s prominence.","[533, 534]"
"A semantically closer translation would be ‘theirIn the example above the subject, verb, object word order in the
final phrase results from moving the yerb forward to give it moremasters beat the black people.’ The word order variation here
indicates the incredible nature of the action.",[582]

"The order with the object following the verb is quite unusual.
SVO does occur in contexts where there is greater emphasis on the
verbal element, as in example 8.",[536]

The order VSO never seems to occur.,[537]
"Demonstrative ModifiersIn contrast to the great majority of all modifiers, demonstrative
modifiers are nouns. In addition, most occur before the noun they
modify. Their function is strictly demonstrative; they are otherwise
unremarkable in form. Their first unusual feature is that they occur
more often as independent words than as demonstratives; their
second unusual feature is their use as locative demostratives. In the
latter case some occur without any suffixes, while others take anelement -d:li. The following list is ordered in terms of increasingdistance from the speaker.",[505]

"SolomonModifiers of nouns and verbs are indistinguishable as a form
class. They are used to modify the meaning of nouns and verbs

Koasati modifiers are all nominal, even though most are derived
from verbs. In addition, noun modifiers are more basic than verb
modifiers, the latter being frequently derived from the former by
suffixation (e.g., palhikkg ‘slow,’ palhikkon ‘slowly’.
Noun Modifiers (“Adjectives”)order subject, object, verb (SVO), the most unmarked word orderBecause in general noun modifiers are nominalized verbs, they

speakers to use -fo- when referring to personal experiences, even
when sixty or seventy years in the past, and to use -ki- when
referring to actions performed by others at such a length of time.
One reason may be that the tense suffix -ki- is used in traditionalnarrativeconnotations of mythological time. Or, the reason could be simple

"Because numerals are verbs, their syntax is very different in
Koasati than in English. If a numeral is not the main verb of thesentence, it must be related to that verb—with the connective suffixNINE-habit-conn BE-be-phr:termTRUTH-art-t if it shares the same subject with that verb, or with the switchreference suffix -n if the subjects are different. A noun governed
by a numeral is actually the subject of the verbal phrase including
the numeral. If the numeral phrase shares the subject with a
following verb, the noun in the numeral phrase is overtly marked
for subject. If the following verb has a different subject, the noun
in the numeral phrase appears in the autonomous case, stripped of
its subject marking.
This situation is exactly parallel to what
happens in adjectival phrases, when the adjective is an underlying
verb (see chap. 17 for a discussion of the loss of the nominative
case marker in adjectival phrases).

"Comparison of Noun ModifiersComparison of modifiers is not common, nor have noun modifiers
been found nominalized and used as subjects or objects of other
verbs. This is due primarily to stylistic considerations, A native
speaker of Koasati prefers to make a comparison of equality rather
than one of inequality, of which a comparative construction basically
consists (see Kimball, 1989b). When a comparison of inequality isformed, the modifier is used invariably in its verbal form, inflectedwith the auxiliary verb mdzyan (class 2Ai) ‘to be more’; the standard
of comparison is indicated by the dative prefix attached to the verb
mé:yan. The modifier is joined to the auxiliary with the suffix -k ifthe statement is a comparative, with the suffix -t if the statement issuperlative,

constructions and vocabulary to handle relative clauses, Koasati
does not have any distinguishing features that mark certain clauses
as being relative. However, it does have constructions that are
translated as relative (even though in this language’s own terms theyare not “relative”), and it is these constructions that will beSEE-pres:part-subj-focthat my father saw is your wife.’MEAT2ss(1A)-EAT-pres:part-obj:foc COOK-Iss-PastG:la-fa atitya-li-sdy-ok hahci apatah-6-:li-:s

Very frequently, the Koasati translation equivalent of a relative
clause is a participial phrase, which is in its own terms a kind of
noun phrase. A participial construction is frequently used if the
noun to be “relativized” is in a locative case,.as in the following
examples.

"All these interrogative suffixes contain the glottal stop and flanking accents of the7. When the subject of a verb is a possessed noun and the action of the verb
reflects back onto the possessor, a dative pronominal prefix must be used with theverb. This construction is similarin outward form to possessor raising in Choctaw
and Chickasaw; however it differs sharply from possessor raising in these two
languages. First, the “raised"" form is basic—i.c., an action referring back to a
possessed noun must always take a prefix cross-referencing the possessor. Second,
the possessed noun never loses its possessor marking, as in Choctaw and
Chickasaw,

‘T will teach you how to shoot.’In example 10 note the shifting of the object to the head of the

of this feature),The use of the verbal noun is semantically restricted, indicating
that the action of a verb is considered to be occuring a number of
times in sequence, or continuing over a broad band of time. Thus,
in example 13 the verbal noun is used because the desire not to
