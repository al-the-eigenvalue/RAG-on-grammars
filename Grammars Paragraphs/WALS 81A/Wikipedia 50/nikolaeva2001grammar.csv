"24.1. Word order at a clause level
Udihe exhibits certain typological features of a head-final SOV language: a
head-final noun phrase (Chapter 13) and relative clause (19.1), a left-branching
complement embedded clause before the matrix verb (Chapter 20),
postpositions (10.2), etc. Indeed, the SOV order is the most common
statistically as well. The typical SOV order is illustrated by examples below.
(1765) a.b.c.",[876]
"Chapter 24
Information structure and word orderThis chapter deals with the effects of information structuring on the surface
shape of the clause. We assume that the information structure is an independent
level of clause representation that deals with the ""packaging"" of the
information in the utterance. The relevant units of the information structure
here considered as primitives are topic and focus. In their definition we will
rely heavily on the practice of Lambrecht (1994) where they are identified in
relation to one another and to the corresponding proposition. Topic will be
understood as the subject about which the proposition is pragmatically
construed (Lambrecht 1994: 131). The existence of a topic participant is
presupposed by the speaker, so topic is always (a part of) the pragmatic
presupposition of the utterance. Focus will be understood as ""the semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion
differs from the presupposition"" (Lambrecht 1994: 213). If the presupposition
is lacking, the focus and the assertive part of the utterance coincide. Thus,
every sentence has a focus, but not every sentence necessarily has a topic (if it
lacks a pragmatic presupposition). Roughly speaking, sentence elements that
do not correspond to the functions of topic and focus may be viewed as neutral
with respect to information structure.
Although, strictly speaking, the notions ""topic"" and ""focus"" refer to relations
at the level of information structure, we will use these terms to refer to the
corresponding elements of the clause as well. Topic normally corresponds to a
non-verbal constituent whose referent is mentioned in the discourse, although
new topics are possible as well. As distinct from the topic, focus can
correspond not only to the nominal constituent, but to a verbal constituent as
well.
We will further assume that information structure functions stand in a certain
mapping relationship to syntactic and semantic units. However, this is a matter
of considerable controversy, and no attempt will be made to describe here such
mapping relationships in Udihe. This chapter only concentrates on the
correspondences between a particular information structure status and the
linear order of the sentence elements. As demonstrated below, word order in
Udihe is primarily motivated by information structure considerations, although
grammatical information is also relevant.
Section 24.1 deals with word order at a clause level. Additional information
about word order can also be found in other chapters, particularly those on840 Information structure and word order
questions and negation (Chapter 23), on the adverbs (10.1.7), and the particles
(Chapter 12). Word order within a regular NP is treated in Chapter 13.
In some cases the information structure, together with semantics, conditions
the sentence construction, that is, the encoding of semantic units by
grammatical relations. Some remarks on this may be found in Chapter 16 on
the valence-changing operations. Such alternative constructions at the level of
the clause were discussed in Chapter 16. In section 24.2 we address the word
order and information structure driven alternative encoding of sentence
elements within a noun phrase, while in 24.3 we focus on copular
constructions.","[874, 875, 876]"

24.1.2.2. Presentational construction
A new participant is usually introduced in the discourse as a subject within
presentational constructions in which the correlation between the subject and
the topic is violated. In Udihe the (indefinite) subject of presentational
sentences is regularly postposed after the verb. It may be immediately
postverbal, as in (1773), or separated from the verb by other lexical material, as
in (1774).

some noun phrases, such as the possessive phrase, the head-final order is
obligatory. Other noun phrases demonstrate a split in head properties: in certain
constructions attributes may raise to the phrase-final position and receive some
other head properties (24.2.1.1). Postpositional phrases and non-finite clauses
are always head-final. In the matrix clause the word order is largely motivated
by information structure. The most important requirement for word order at a
clause level is the immediately preverbal position of the focus element
(including the question words) (24.1.1).
Major grammatical relations, such as the subject, direct object, and indirect
object, are rather easily identified by a cluster of grammatical properties
(Chapter 15). In particular, the subject is a grammatical element associated
with the highest syntactic activity and is the main controller of coreferential
relations, both within the clause and clause-externally. The verb only agrees
with the subject. A number of rules that change grammatical relations apply
(Chapterló). The case marking patterns are uniformly based on the Accusative
system with the following two exceptions. First, the direct object marked with
the reflexive-possessive affix stands in the Nominative (22.3.2). Second, the
single argument of certain constructions denoting state may be encoded by the
Accusative noun phrase (17.2.2.5.2).
The subordinate clause mostly makes use of non-finite verbal forms,
participles, converbs, and infinitives. Clause-chaining is organized around the
switch-reference system, which opposes same-subject and different-subject
relationships (22.5). They are morphologically encoded on the non-finite verbal
forms employed in the subordinate clause. Relative clauses are formally
patterned as attributive noun phrase (Chapter 19), complement clauses as
possessive noun phrases with participles taking corresponding case and
possessive affixes (Chapter 20).","[508, 509, 510, 511]"
"The effect on language contacts on Udihe23However, the influence of Russian on Udihe syntax at the structural level is
surprisingly small compared to other minority languages of Siberia and the
Russian Far East. The following points can be noted here:
(i) Younger speakers tend to follow the Russian word order. In particular,
they place the focus object in a post-verbal position, which violates the major
requirement of Udihe word order, namely, the preverbal position of the focus
element (24.1.1). In general, the fact that verb-finality in modern Udihe is not
rigid (24.1) may be due to the influence of Russian word order. The example
below illustrates a non-head-final embedded clause generally disallowed in
Udihe but which in this case appeared under Russian influence.

'He lived, lived, and learnt that íere were seven girls on the other side
of the sea.' (SKX216)(ii) Another violation of head-finality that may be due to influence of
Russian word order is the postnominal position of proper name apposition
(13.8.2) and the postverbal complement subordinate clause (Chapter 20).
(iii) W/i-words in Udihe are typically not used as subordinators, since clausal
subordination is mostly expressed by non-finite verbal forms; their occasional
use in this function, as in (22), is due to the Russian influence:

come-REP-MUL-INT.PRP-ACC-3SG
tu: pala-wasi:-ni.
all distract-DIV-3SG
'When the father was going to come home, she distracted (her son).'(iv) Certain sentence constructions may be influenced by the corresponding
phenomenon in Russian, namely, the desiderative copular clauses with the
Dative experiencer NP (17.2.3.2), the Impersonal construction (16.1.3), and the
promotion of the nominal patient to the subject position in the Personal Passive
clause (16.1.1).
(v) Cases of ""semantic translation"" from Russian may include the use of the
interrogative pronoun jeu 'what' in tag questions, as in the meaning 'what for,
why' (9.5.1.3), and the adverbial use of the universal quantifier teu 'all; all the
time, always' (11.2.2.1.3).
(vi) Udihe has borrowed certain functional words from Russian (the
conjunctions i 'and', no 'but', a 'and, but', and others) as well as many
interjections.","[56, 57]"

(SKX 76)Cross-linguistically, subject is known to correlate with topic information
structure status, while the direct object is likely to encode the focus (in the
sense of narrow focus). The SOV order in Udihe seems to be a result of three
independent requirements: (i) the preverbal position of the focus (24.1.1), (ii)
subject/topic initiality (24.1.2), and (iii) verb finality (24.1.3). Requirement (i)
appears to be inviolable, therefore, when an element other than the direct object
corresponds to the focus function, the SOV order is abandoned. Requirements
(ii) and (iii) can easily be violated. As a result, the SOV order appears
non-rigid, deviations being motivated by specific information structure
requirements.",[876]

"24.1.1. Focus position
The most important requirement of Udihe word order is the preverbal position
of the focus element. In a clause that does not involve any constituents other
than SOV, this, under normal discourse conditions, results in the preverbal
position of the object. The reason for this is that in such sentences the object
typically corresponds to the focus function, while the subject normally
corresponds to the topic function. In clauses with a more complicated structure,
the focus element is necessarily strictly preverbal independently of its semantic
role. Other elements are located either before the focus element or after the
verb. Different cases are exemplified below.
The focus element (especially the focus that bears an additional contrastive
implication) is highlighted by a high pitch intonation. In the translations we
will capitalize the element that corresponds to the focus function.",[877]

"24.2.1.2.1. Adjectival modifier in focus
According to the general principle of Udihe word order (24.1), the focused

bear a strong (contrastive) focus, may be located preverbally, while the head
noun marked for case is postposed. Such a construction is mostly typical of
different kinds of quantifiers and will be referred to as ""quantifier float""

Grammatical relationsThis chapter presents the major characteristics of Udihe syntax in terms of
grammatical relations. Grammatical relations will be identified here as
syntactic elements that exhibit certain grammatical properties. These properties
concern, first, the form and position of the corresponding element in the clause,
and second, its ability to determine the form and the position of other elements
within the same clause or clause-externally. In this chapter, however, the
position of the elements within the clause is not addressed. Word order in
Udihe is conditioned by information structure rather than by grammatical
relations and is dealt with in the chapter on information structure (Chapter 24).
Section 15.1 focuses on the most important grammatical relation, the subject.
Section 15.2. deals with the direct object. Other arguments are briefly
mentioned in 15.3 but are not dealt with in detail. They are described in
Chapter 14 according to the valence patterns of the verbs. On the other hand, in
section 15.4 we present a detailed description of clausal adjuncts according to
their semantic types. Operations that alternate grammatical relations within the
clause are addressed in Chapter 16.","[567, 568, 569]"
"23.1.2. Yes-no questions
Yes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means or
changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence.
They are differentiated from them only by intonational patterns: the last word is
marked by a higher and more prolonged intonational contour (3.6.4). The finite
verb normally occupies the clause-final position. Examples (1675) show
ordinary yes-no questions, and examples (1676) illustrate negative yes-no
questions.

general, there is a certain freedom of adverbial positioning, as long as the main
requirement of Udihe word order, the preverbal position of the focus element
(24.1.1), is satisfied. Clausal adjuncts with a temporal or spatial meaning, as a
rule, occur sentence-initially (732), although they may follow the subject (733).

any sort of constituent, for example, a subject (845), a predicate (846), and a
postpositional phrase (847). It easily co-occurs with other elements that
normally bear the focus in the sentence, such as the negative auxiliary (848a), a
quantified NP (848b), or an emphatic reflexive pronoun (848c).

Complement subordinate clauseThis chapter deals only with non-finite complement clauses. Finite complement
clauses, and, in particular, direct and indirect speech constructions, are
addressed in Chapter 18. On subordinate questions see section 23.1.4.
The complement subordinate clause in Udihe is a sentential argument with
the syntactic role of the subject (20.1) or the direct object (20.2). The predicate
of the non-finite complement clause is expressed by the Infinitive (7.6.3), a
participle (7.6.1) or, less frequently, by the Purposive Converb (7.6.2.1). The
particular strategy of forming the complement clause is mostly determined by
the matrix verb, therefore the verbs that require each particular type of
complement subordinate clause are given here in a representative list. The
chapter is organized according to the formal types of the complement
subordinate clauses which basically correspond to the valence patterns of the
matrix verbs.
As in the other subordinate clauses (Chapters 19 and 21), the subject of the
complement subordinate clause may or may not be coreferential with the
superordinate clause subject. In the former case the subordinate clause
predicate is marked by same-subject switch-reference affixes, in the latter case
by different-subject affixes. The coreferential subject is often anaphorically
dropped, either from the superordinate clause or from the subordinate clause.
Some types of complement subordinate clauses allow only either same-subject
or different-subject. These are discussed in more detail.
In the sentence, the subject complement clause (sentential subject) occupies
the linear position usually associated with the subject (see 24.1.2). The object
complement subordinate clause normally immediately precedes its head, the
matrix verb, but it can also be separated from the matrix verb by VP adverbs or
other elements. The postposing of the complement clause in the postverbal
position is allowed. The complement clause itself is head-final, although
younger speakers occasionally allow non-verb-final complement clauses,
apparently under the influence of the Russian word order (1.5.2.2.2). The
subject, if overtly present within a complement clause, tends to occupy the
leftmost position.","[737, 738, 739]"
"Information structure within the noun phrase 859
The topicalized left-dislocated Accusative noun phrase is normally separated
by a pause from the rest of the sentence, and should perhaps be analyzed as
clause-external, cf. also the following example:
(1811)£¿ zugdi-we
bi
anda-i
this house-ACC
me
friend-1SG
wo-iti.
make-3PL
'This house, they are building it for my friend.'zugdi-ne-ni
house-DEST-3SG24.2.2.2. Modifier in focus
If the destinative object takes a modifier other than the destinative modifier (for
example, an adjective) it may be focused. As was argued in 24.1.1, the major
requirement of Udihe word order is the preverbal position of the focus element,
with the result that certain focus modifiers must be placed in the preverbal
position. This results in the discontinuous noun phrase (24.2.1.2). For
destinative constructions another strategy applies: the focus modifier within the
destinative noun phrase does not occupy the strictly preverbal position, but
modifies the Accusative object located in the preverbal position. The object,
therefore, is syntactically ""doubled"" as the Accusative object located in the
preverbal position and as the Destinative object (normally clause-initial). The
latter corresponds to the presuppositional (topical) part of the utterance.

"Chapter 13
Noun phraseA noun phrase consists of a head and an optional modifier. The following
grammatical classes function as nominal heads: nouns and pro-nouns (personal
pronouns, possessive pronouns, and indefinite pronouns, see Chapter 9). In
headless noun phrases the head noun is omitted, while cardinal numerals,
quantifiers, adjectives, pro-adjectives, and the relative clause undergo
nominalization. These cases are not treated in this chapter (on the headless
relative clause see section 19.5, and on the headless noun phrase see 22.2.3).
Pro-nouns do not take a modifier, with the exception of the relative clause.
Ordinary nouns may function as attributive forms only when there is a
possessive relation between them and the head. Some exceptions are addressed
in 13.7.
The following classes of modifiers are available: pro-nouns (that is, Personal
pronouns), adjectives, pro-adjectives (Demonstrative and indefinite Pronouns),
quantifiers, postpositional phrases, oblique-case noun phrases, and the relative
clause. The relative clause is discussed in Chapter 19. Articles are missing, and
definiteness may be expressed by means of 3rd person possessive affixes
(4.3.1.1). Head nomináis cannot be modified by a simple adverbial. Adjectival
modification may also be performed by the derivational affixes -ziga (5.1.1.1)
and -ηΑ: (5.1.1.5).
The noun phrase is typically head-final. However, under certain information
structure driven conditions the order within particular noun phrases is reversed:
the modifier occupies the phrase-final position and is characterized by certain
other head properties. This process will be referred to as ""modifier raising"" and
is addressed in 24.2.1.1. As shown there, modifier raising is observed in the
situation when the modifier and the head noun bear different information
structure statuses. In this chapter we will only focus on noun phrases that are
""neutral"" (not partitioned) from the point of view of information structure, and
that correspondingly do not demonstrate modifier raising. Yet, even in this
case, head-finality is not rigid. Certain classes of modifiers - the postpositional
phrase, the oblique-case noun phrase, and certain appositions - are always
postnominal, independent of any information structure considerations, so
head-finality is violated. Other modifiers (numerals and some other quantifiers)
may be prenominai and postnominal without being raised. The word order
within noun phrases with each individual modifier is discussed in the480Noun phrasecorresponding sections, while section 13.10 focuses on word order within a
noun phrase with several modifiers.
The syntactic relationship between the head and the modifier is encoded
morphologically only in certain types of noun phrase: the possessive noun
phrase (13.1) and the phrase where the modifier corresponds to the indefinite
pronoun (9.6). Otherwise the modifier is merely juxtaposed to the head noun.
The only lexical material that may be inserted between the head and the
modifier are focus particles, cf.:

tene
bugdi-le-ni
child-REF
CONT leg-LOC-3SG
'He strung his child's legs.'su:ne:-k.
string.PAST-EXPROn discontinuous noun phrases see 24.2.1.2.
Attributive agreement in case is absent with the notable exception of some
quantifiers (13.3.4), some types of appositions (13.8.2), and relative clauses
(see Chapter 19). Attributive agreement in number is obligatory only when the
head nominal is morphologically marked for plurality (13.2.2). In the ""neutral""
noun phrase discussed here the external syntactic role of the noun phrase is

The floated quantifier always has a morphologically bare Nominative form, as
distinct from the constructions where the postposed quantifier agrees in case
with the head nominal (13.3.6). The floated quantifier, therefore, behaves
morphologically as an unchangeable adverb rather than an adjective or other
determiner.
The quantifiers that undergo floating are: the universal quantifiers teu and
käu (in the Northern dialect) 'all', the scalar quantifiers lä(si), egdi, and tä(si)
'many, much, a lot', and - less frequently - some quantitative nouns with
partitive meaning (13.3.3). Floated quantifiers do not inflect for case.
The floated quantifier is located in the immediately preverbal position and
bears the focus function. Quantifier float is normally triggered by the subject,
as shown in (1799) or the direct object, as in (1800). It seems that grammatical854 Information structure and word order
relations other than the subject and the direct object cannot trigger quantifier
float. Typically the head noun immediately precedes the quantifier, but this is
not necessary so. It may be postposed after the verb (1801).

"13.1. Possessive noun phrase
The most important formal characteristic of the possessive noun phrase is that
the relationship between the modifier (the possessor) and the head (the
possessed noun) is encoded by possessive affixes on the head. The only type of
possessive noun phrase where the possessive affixes on the head noun are
missing are reciprocal possessives (22.4.1.2).
As distinct from most other noun phrases, the possessive noun phrase has a
fixed word order ""modifier - head""; that is, it does not undergo inversion
because of information structure.
Noun phrases in which the modifier corresponds to the interrogative
pronouns (pro-nouns) j'eu 'what' or ni 'who' or the indefinite pronouns j'eu-ke
'something' and ni-ke 'somebody' are structurally organized in the same way
as the possessive noun phrase with a nominal modifier (see 9.5.1.1).",[514]

Introduction1.1. The Udihe language and its genetic affiliation
Udihe (other spellings used are Udehe, Udegej, Udege, Udeghe, Udige,
Udighe, LJde) is a Tungus language spoken as a first language by
approximately 100 people, all over 50 years old, in the southern part of the
Russian Far East (see 1.2.3 for more information on the number of speakers
and 1.2.4 on its geographical location). Udihe is divided into two dialects each
with several local variants (1.3). Despite a lack of official status or written
tradition, several attempts have been made to create a writing system for use in
schools (1.6.2, 1.6.3).
The Tungus (Tungus-Manchu) language family is widely assumed to be a
branch of Altaic. The scheme in (1) represents the classification of the Tungus
languages as accepted in Vasilevic (1960) and Sunik (1962: 16-20, 1968: 54,
1997: 154). The alternative classifications either group together the Manchu
and Southern Tungus languages (Cincius 1949; Benzing 1955: 9-10; Menges
1978: 370; Comrie 1981: 58) or treat Northern Tungus, Southern Tungus, and
Manchu as three independent branches (Avrorin 1959-1961). On some other
classifications and/or comparisons between them see Menges (1968: 25-30),
Ikegami (1974), Doerfer (1978), Vovin (1993), and Miller (1994).

Manchu, JurchenThe closest linguistic relative of Udihe is the Oroch language, spoken in
roughly the same region. In fact, until the beginning of the twentieth century2 Introduction
the Udihe were thought to be part of the Oroch people, and were referred to as
Orochs or Orochons (1.7.1). However, closer examination of the linguistic and
anthropological data, as well as the oral tradition (see, for example, the
collection of Oroch folklore in Avrorin and Lebedeva (1978)), suggests that
they are in fact two different ethnic groups. On the phonetic and morphological
correspondences between the Oroch and Udihe languages see Cincius (1949)
and Kormusin (1998: 4-6).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"Chapter 17
Copular clausesCopular clauses vary greatly in their meaning, but generally speaking they tend
to denote some kind of state. In this chapter they are unified only on formal
grounds: the predicate includes two components, the copula, and the
predicative phrase as such. Such constructions will be called ""copular
constructions"". The copular constructions described in this chapter differ from
analytical verbal forms that may include the same copula (such as, for example,
the Pluperfect). The latter are the regular grammaticalized means of forming
analytical verbal inflectional categories and are described in Chapter 7, while
the copular constructions are free syntactic combinations of the copula and a
separate lexical item with a predicative value. Although the predicative element
tends to immediately precede the copula it may be postposed, as below, or
separated by other lexical material.
(1210) Tehu-ni
bih-ni
eze-xi.
all-3Sg
be-3SG
master-PROP
'Everybody has a master.' (SK 940)
In contrast, no other elements intervene between the two components of the
analytical verbal category, and their order cannot be changed.
The copula in copular constructions behaves like regular verbs in the matrix
or the subordinate clause with respect to word order and morphology. It takes
the corresponding tense/aspect/mood or non-finite form and is marked for
subject agreement. In section 17.1 we will describe the various types of copula.
Predicative elements of copular constructions usually belong to one of the
following morphological classes: adjectives, nouns, some participles, or in rare
cases, adverbs. In 17.2 different copular constructions are presented according
to the valence patterns and further subtypes of the predicative element.
A number of copular constructions undergo formal restructuring due to
processes of topicalization or focalization; these are addressed in 24.3.","[642, 643]"

Adverbial clauseMost adverbial clauses in Udihe are non-finite: they can be infinitival,
participial, or converbial. The morphology of the Infinitive, the active
participles, and the con verbs is described in Chapter 7; other types of
participles are not used in the adverbial clause (for the one exception see
21.3.1.6). The semantic type of the infinitival and converbial adverbial clauses
is largely determined by the subordinate predicate itself, that is, by the
particular type of converbs or infinitive. The semantic type of the participial
clause is normally conditioned by the case- or postpositional marking on the
participle. In this chapter, the adverbial non-finite clauses are classified
according to their formal and semantic types.
Typically the position of the adverbial clause in the sentence is either at the
beginning or at the end. It does not intrude between verbal arguments or
between an argument and the verb, with the exception of the infinitival manner
clause (21.1.1) when it consists of one word (the predicate). There is a strong
tendency to front the adverbial clause. However, a purpose clause is usually
postverbal.","[759, 760, 761]"

other material is available.",[666]

"24.2.1. Non-possessive noun phrase
Here we focus on the alternative organization of the modified non-possessive
noun phrase, mostly those in which the modifier corresponds to an adjective or
a quantifier. As was argued in Chapter 13, the noun phrase is normally
head-final. Attributive agreement in case is absent, while agreement in numberInformation structure within the noun phrase847is optional (13.2.2). The relation between the head and the non-possessive
modifier is not encoded by any special morphological device. However, under
conditions driven mainly by considerations of information structure there may
be variance in word order and the encoding of the attributive relationship
within a noun phrase.
Generally speaking, the regular organization of the noun phrase described in
Chapter 13 is observed when both the modifier and the head noun bear the
same status in the information structure (topic, focus, or neutral). This results in
the noun phrase being unpartitioned from the point of view of information
structure. When their statuses differ, either the modifier is raised (24.2.1.1), or
the noun phrase is organized discontinuously (24.2.1.2).","[882, 883]"
"MorphologyUdihe exhibits a rather high degree of morphological synthesis. The
inflectional grammatical classes have more than one morpheme per word. A
number of grammatical morphemes are semantically equivalent to separate
lexical items in the European languages, cf., for example, wakca-na-mu:i'want to go to hunt' where -nA- is the Directive verbal suffix which indicates
movement in order to accomplish the action specified by the verbal stem, and
-mu:i- is the Desiderative affix. Yet a ""polysynthetic"" combination of a large
number of morphemes within one word is not possible. Theoretically, the
nominal word may include at most six morphemes (the root, the derivational
affix, the Alienable Possessive suffix, the Possessive affix, the number affix
and case affix), and the verbal word may include six or seven morphemes (the
root, three or four derivational affixes, tense/mood, and agreement). In practice,
however, such cases are rarely found, and the noun normally contains no more
than three or four morphemes, and the verb contains no more than five
morphemes.
The morphological structure of Udihe is characterized by a certain level of
agglutination. Typically, the words can be easily divided into a linear sequence
of distinct morphs, each of which has a fairly consistent shape and a single
function. The agglutination, however, is not absolute; in many cases the
boundaries between the morphemes are not clear-cut, and several grammatical
meanings are combined within one ""portmanteau"" morph. This is mostly due to
the various morphological alternations described in 2.3. One example is the
frequent conflation of the /-final stem or affix with the following /-initial
morpheme. Thus, the 1st person Possessive affix -/ (e.g. anda 'friend', anda-i
'my friend') conflates with the preceding Iii within the Lative inflection -tigi
(anda-tigi-i <friend-LAT-lSG> —> anda-tigi: 'to my friend'). This creates a
'portmanteau' morph -tigi: which indicates both the Lative and the 1st person
singular. Some morphemes, however, have several grammatical functions, and
this is not a result of morphonological alternations (at least at the synchronic
level). For example, the suffix (')-si marks both the Perfective Converb and the
same-subject switch-reference relation (7.5.2.3.2).
The only type of affixes found in Udihe are suffixes, that is, all bound
morphemes follow the root. Although synthesis predominates in the expression
of grammatical meanings, a few analytical constructions are present. Certain
aspectual, temporal, and modal categories are formed with the auxiliary verb
(see Chapter 7). Other morphological processes are reduplication,98Noun inflectionalmorphologycompounding and conversion. Overall, incorporation is not typical; some
incorporation-like phenomena are addressed in 6.4.1.2.2, 8.3, and 10.1.3.1.1.
The major open word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) can be
easily distinguished by morphological and syntactic criteria.","[129, 130, 131, 132]"
"17.2.1.3. Existential construction
The construction predicates the existence of a certain entity in general, in a
particular location, or in somebody's temporary possession. This entity
corresponds to the predicative element. It immediately precedes the copula,
however, it may also be postposed, as in (1234). The postposition of the
predicative element seems to be a recent development and can perhaps be
explained by the influence of Russian word order.
(1234) Bu zugdi-du:
we house-DAT. 1PL.EX
'There is a cat in our house.'bie
keige.
be.PRES.HAB catThe noun-predicative element does not have subject properties as identified in
15.1.1.
The existential meaning is licensed by the Habitual copula bie.
Non-existence is asserted by the negative copula anci, see 23.2.1.5.1.",[653]
"Almost every element of the superordinate clause, therefore, can be relativized
with the help of the active participle. It does not seem possible to relativize the
adverbial syntactic positions expressed by a postpositional phrase and the standard
of comparison. Examples of relativization into a subordinate clause are missing
and we will assume that even if they are theoretically possible, they are extremely
unusual in Udihe.
The Passive, Resultative, and Destinative Participles are inherently oriented to
express a particular participant of the situation - a patient/theme (passive
participle, but see exceptions in experiencer of the resultative situation
(Resultative Participle), or an object destined for action (Destinative Participles).
Therefore in relative clauses with these types of participles only these particular
roles are relativized.
There are three major types of relative clause - external, internal, and
discontinuous, described in sections 19.1, 19.2, and 19.3, respectively. They use
different formal strategies with respect to the position of the participle and in
marking the syntactic role of the relativized noun. The external relative clause is
prenominai and uses the so-called gapping strategy, that is, the grammatical role
of the relativized noun is not overtly indicated within the relative clause but
corresponds to the syntactic gap. In the internal relative clause the participle is
postnominal and corresponds to the syntactic head of the relative clause, while a
relativized noun is internal to the relative. In the discontinuous clause the
relativized noun and the relative clause are not adjacent to each other. There are
no syntactic and/or semantic restrictions on forming external and internal types of
relative clause; both strategies apply to all grammatical relations accessible to
relativization. The discontinuous clause is a marginal type, which allows only the
subject and the direct object to relativize. Within each strategy there are additional
formal differences between the cases in which the head noun corresponds to the
subject of the relative clause, and in which the head noun does not coincide with
the subject of the relative clause.
From the communicative point of view, internal and discontinuous relative
clauses seem to involve the topicalization of the relativized noun (on the notion of
topic and topicalization of other sentence elements see Chapter 24). In fact, they
are structurally similar to other postnominal modifiers available when the headExternal strategy 675
noun is topicalized (24.2.1). Semantically, it appears that only internal and
discontinuous relative clauses may be non-restrictive, while a restrictive
interpretation is possible for all three types.
The word order within the relative clause may vary, but its predicate always
occupies the last linear position, while its subject (if different from the head noun)
must be clause-initial within the external relative. However, this is not necessarily
so within the internal relative clause.
The structure of this chapter is based on a formal classification of relative
clauses. Apart from the three major types mentioned above, it also describes the
copular relative clause (19.4), the headless relative clause (19.5), and depictives
(19.6).","[710, 711]"
"7.6. Non-finite forms
Non-finite forms do not normally express independent predication, but serve to
express the predicate of the subordinate clause. In some cases certain types of
participles and infinitives serve as finite predicates. However, they co-occur
with the auxiliary verb bi- 'be', and therefore, strictly speaking, the participle
or the infinitive itself does not take the finite position in the sentence. Analytic
forms of that type are described in the sections on finite verbal forms (7.4 and
7.5), and on copula constructions (Chapter 17).
Although some of the non-finite verbal forms exhibit the morphological
categories of a noun (case and possessive), all of them behave like verbs with
respect to their internal syntactic properties. They keep the valence patterns of
the verb, their arguments appear in the same form as the corresponding finite
verb, and they cannot be modified by nouns or adjectives. However, they are
compatible with a VP-adverb, as shown by the next example where the
Purposive converb is modified by a qualificative adverb in -zi.
(369) Wo:-i
a:-zi
bi-lege-fi.
kill-IMP.2SG
good-INST
be-PURP-lPL.IN
'Kill (him) in order that we may be well.'
Non-finite verbal forms have an internally fixed tense/aspect/mood structure.
Most of them are specialized in conveying a particular temporal and/or modal
meaning, and all of them are easily compatible with aspectual (Aktionsart) and226Verbal morphologyvalence-changing affixes, subject to the usual semantic restrictions (on them
see Chapter 8), for example:
(370) a.b.","[259, 260]"
"7.8.1.3.1. Resultative meaning
The main function of the Perfect is to refer to a perfective event in the past. It
therefore combines a time reference with an aspectual meaning. Like the
Perfect in a number of other languages, the Udihe Perfect in this function
triggers the implication of result, that is, the relevance of the past situation at
the moment of speech (as opposed to the Past tense). Normally, only telic verbs
are used in this function in the Perfect.
Clauses with the Perfect tend to be short. Typically they do not include any
constituents other than the subject and the verb itself. This is probably related
to the communicative function that is often associated with the verb in the
Perfect. It tends to convey new (focus) information. With the assumption that
each clause normally conveys one piece of new information, other non-verbal
constituents are unlikely to co-occur with the focussed verb.

"9.6.4.4. The indefinite substitution word aqi
The element aqi is a pronominal stem used when a speaker is looking for an
appropriate word and cannot recollect it. The stem αηϊ is inflected in exactly
the same way as the corresponding constituent in the clause should be
inflected. The word that actually has to be in the sentence is normally used

same inflectional form. In (650a) the word αηϊ is in the Nominative and
replaces the subject (belie)·, in (650b) and (650c) it is in the Accusative because
it replaces the direct object (zakta-wa and xulepte-we, respectively), in (650d) it
replaces a verb in the Subjunctive, while in (650e) it replaces a nominal
modifier (note the Plural marker -ziga which encodes the semantic plurality of
the replaced noun Suatjka 'the Suankas'). The element αηϊ is glossed as IND
(indefinite).

"12.1.1.7.1. Replaced topic
Normally the particle -IA signalizes the introduction of a new participant in the
text, and is placed after the subject when it differs from the subject of the
previous sentence (862a). The sentences where the subject is followed by the
particle -IA may appear at the very beginning of the text. This, in fact, indicates
that the function of this particle is to mark a new topic, whether it replaces the
old topic or not. Example (862b) is the beginning of a folklore tale.

"4.1. Nominal inflection
The order of inflectional morphemes in the nominal word is as follows:
(128) stem - (Plural) - (Alienable Possessive) - (Possessive Plural) - (case)
(Possessive)4.1.1. Nominal stems
Diachronically there were at least three different types of nominal stems,
described in Schneider (1936) as vowel-final, n-final, and /-final stems.
Vowel-final stems will be referred to as class I nouns and their declension will
correspondingly be referred to as class I declension. The old /-final stems
behave in the modern language like class I nouns, that is, they have become
vowel-final (4.1.1.1). However, nouns whose stem ends in Ini preserve some
peculiarities, and these will be referred to as class Π nouns, while their
declension will be called the class Π declension. Generally speaking, the old
system with three types of noun stems is at present in a state of collapse, but a
final reduction to one stem type has not yet occurred. Some traces of the old
system are still preserved, especially in the speech of the older generation. The
class I and class Π declensions are still clearly opposed, although the number of
class Π words is gradually declining. Below we present the paradigms that
illustrate the difference between the declension of the class I and class Π nouns.",[133]

"23.1.1. W7i-questions
In w/i-questions the question word (a certain form of the Interrogative pronoun)
replaces the questioned constituent. Question words are listed in 9.5. Any
constituent of the main clause can be questioned in this way. The position of
the question word is strictly before the finite predicate, in accordance with the
more general rule on the preverbal position of the focus element (24.1.1). The
only exception is the question word i:mi 'why' (23.1.1.6). In questions to the
modifier the whole modified noun phrase must immediately precede the
predicate. The preverbal question word, like other focus elements (24.1.1), may
be sentence-initial (1647), however, other constituents (in particular the
subject) can precede it, as in (1648).

"Direct object551In 16.1.4.4 examples are presented for the passivization of the Accusative
causee argument.
15.2.1.3. Depictives
The direct object, as opposed to the other grammatical relations, but together
with the subject, can control certain depictives, that is, secondary predicates
(see 19.6).
15.2.1.4. Control structures
The direct object is coreferential with the subject of subordinate clauses of
certain types, the so-called ""object-control"" clauses (20.2.2.1 and 20.2.3.2).
15.2.1.5. Attributive case-agreement
The direct object and subject are the only grammatical relations that trigger
attributive case-agreement in the quantified noun phrase (13.3.6) and the
relative clause (19.2.3).
15.2.2. Destinative object
Apart from the Accusative direct object, characterized by the syntactic
properties described in 15.2.1, the patient/theme argument may be encoded by
the destinative object (16.2.2). The destinative object corresponds to a
possessive noun phrase whose head is marked by the Destinative case and the
possessive affix. The head noun denotes an object designated for a particular
person (benefactive) or purpose, which, in its turn, can be encoded by the
modifier noun and is cross-referenced by the personal affix.
Similarly to the regular direct object (19.6), the destinative object can control
depictives, as illustrated in (1094).
