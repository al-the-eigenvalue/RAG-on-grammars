38ArgumentsThe propensity of the A-argument to be missing
(95% are missing)
correlates with the fact, documented in numerous languages,
that
new information
is virtually never introduced
as the A-argument
of
a transitive
clause.
This
is the basis
of DuBois's
'given A
constraint'
which
we
see
confirmed
in
Rama.
Meanwhile,

is worth
noting
that
DuBois's
proposed
""preferred
argument
structure’
and
'given A constraint'
came
from his search for a
motivation for the phenomenon of ergativity,
i.e. for a reson why
the
subject
of a transitive
verb would
be encoded
differently
from the subject of an intransitive verb, which in turn would be
encoded the same as the object of a transitive verb, This search
for a motivation for ergativity has cast the phenomenon in a new
light:
ergativity can now be seen as a morphological encoding ofdiscourse information flow.
However,
as seen with the sample
here,
the same pattern
of information
flow obtains
in Rama,
though Rama is not a morphologically ergative language.","[246, 247]"
