This is illustrated in (6.4-5). The difference between these two examples is related to how
topical the referent is in the context. In (6.4) nokae ‘canoe’ is unmarked implying that the
canoe is not topical and has a ‘generic’ referent. In (6.5) ‘canoe’ is specific (a speaker has a
specific referent in mind) and is therefore marked with topical non-S/A subject marker -na. 189
The marking of the core cases (S/A and O) is discussed in §6.2.

‘Did you make the canoe?’ (implying that you know how to make canoes)In addition to the typical SV/AOV constituent order (see §6.3), the overt core-case marking is
one of the main grammatical mechanism to distinguish core arguments within a clause (see
also Chapter 8 on valency-changing mechanisms). When no overt morphological marking of
grammatical relations is present, in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding, the order
of the NPs helps to determine syntactic functions of core arguments. It is thus apparent that
there are two mechanisms for distinguishing syntactic functions of the core arguments in
Murui: the morphological mechanism (i.e. overt case marking on S/A and O arguments) and
the syntactic mechanism (i.e. constituent order).","[295, 296]"

6.4SummaryGenerally, Murui has two mechanisms to distinguish syntactic functions of the core
arguments in Murui: the morphological mechanism (i.e. the overt case marking on S/A and O
arguments) (discussed in §6.2), and the syntactic mechanism (i.e. if the grammatical marking
is absent, the constituent order in which NPs occurs in relation to the predicate) (§6.3). Murui
has a nominative-accusative case marking system, and distinguishes between core and
oblique arguments. The core arguments, the subject S/A and the non-subject O are subject to
differential case marking. Core arguments can also be marked for the locative/dative case,
which can be omitted with pronouns. In Murui, it is the discourse status of the S/A and O
arguments (including their topicality and specificity) that determines whether they receive the
case markers. In addition to the core cases in the language, there are five oblique cases in
Murui: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactive-casual, and privative. Each has a number
of specific functions and meanings. Oblique cases do not co-occur with core-cases in a single
NP; an exception might be the ablative. The overview of core and oblique cases is given in
Table 6.3. Murui has a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent ordering – S, A followed
by O, occur before the V. The constituent order, however, allows certain flexibility.","[339, 340]"
"313
In Murui, there is a certain flexibility in the constituents patterns where the oblique argument
(marked as X) occurs either before the verb (XSV and XAOV) and after the V (i.e. SVX and
AOVX). In (6.167) the oblique jofomo ‘home’ is placed after the verb:
jai
jaai-d-e?PRED
(6.167) L: nai-mɨeS
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M already go-LK-3
‘Did (he) go already?’
A:jɨɨ
jai
jaai-d-ePRED jo-fo-moLOC
yes already go-LK-3
house-CLF:CAV-LOC
‘Did (he) go home already?’Oblique arguments in transitive clauses usually follow the O (i.e. AOXV), but can also be
fronted, or postposed to the verb. Occasionally, the A argument in a transitive clause can also
follow the verb yielding the OVA constituent order. This has a kind of afterthought effect;
there is a short pause between V and A. This is illustrated in (6.168-169). In (6.168) the A
argument, Flor, is postposed to the verb roko(de) ‘cook’. This is similar in (6.169). VOA and
VAO constituent orders never occur in the natural discourse.
(6.168) ɨmeO roko-d-ePRED FlorA
paca cook-LK-3 Flor
‘FLOR cooks a paca.’
(6.169) nokaeO fɨno-d-ePRED [kue uzu-ma]A
canoe
make-LK-3 1sg grandparent-CLF:DR.M
‘My grandfather made A CANOE.’
The postposition of the A argument is similar to the occasional VCS constituent order in
intransitive clauses. This is illustrated in (6.170):
(6.170) T: [oo uzu-ño]S
nɨ-rui
rii?PRED
2sg grandparent-CLF:DR.F Q2-CLF:DAY arrive
‘When did your grandmother come.’
W: nare
rii-d-ePRED
[kue uzu-ño]S
yesterday arrive-LK-3 1sg grandparent-CLF:DR.F
‘My grandmother CAME yesterday.’314
In passive constructions (see §8.1) the constituent ordering is of great importance. Different
orders can yield different interpretations. Compare (6.171-172):
(6.171) jɨkoOBLIQUE ainɨ-kaPRED
dog
bite-PASS
‘(somebody, e.g. a boy) was bitten by a dog’
(6.172) (janayari)OBLIQUE ainɨ-kaPRED jɨkoS
jaguar
bite-PASS
dog
‘the dog was bitten (by a jaguar)’
Often, there is some kind of morphological marking of grammatical relations in the clause
(§6.2). To avoid any potential misunderstanding when core arguments are zero-marked, the
order of the NPs can help to determine syntactic functions of core arguments. These syntactic
functions are shown by the nominative–accusative ordering of arguments in relation to the
predicate: SV (SXV) and AOV (AOXV) (the oblique ‘X’ arguments have to be marked).
There is a certain flexibility in the constituent patterns where the oblique argument may
occasionally precede the S/A argument (XSV and XAOV), or occur following the verb (SVX
and AOVX). This suggests that X arguments have a certain degree of mobility within a
clause. Occasionally, the O argument can occur in the clause-final position, i.e. AVO. Even
though it is not common, the O argument can precede the A argument in transitive clauses
(OAV). In such instances, the accusative marking on O NP is often retained, regardless of the
referent’s discourse status. There is also a prosodic emphasis (pitch) on the A argument
(which might explain why in those cases the nominative marking is not necessarily retained).
In dependent clauses the constituent order appears to be rigid, verb-final (see §12.3). The
order of constituents in those clauses with increased valency is AO1VO2, in those with
decreased valency is SOOBLIQUEV (see also Chapter 8).","[337, 338, 339]"

reallyAll the ambitransitive and strictly transitive verbs can be passivized. The constitituent order
in transitive clauses follows the overall AOV tendency (see §6.3).
D. EXTENDED TRANSITIVE CLAUSES contain a strictly transitive verb with transitive subject (S)
and two transitive objects (O) and (E) as core arguments (§3.1.2). Similarly to transitive
clauses, strictly transitive verbs can mark the A NP with the topical S/A subject marker =dɨ
and the O NP with the topical non-S/A subject marker -na. Extended transitive clauses
obligatorily take the second O NP (Recipient/Addressee) marked with the dative/locative
-mo. An example of an extended transitive clause is given in (12.12) where the O NP
argument is gift guiye ‘food’ and the second (extended) argument is recipient gato ‘cat’:

‘She gave that food to the cat.’
E. VERBLESS CLAUSES are used meanings for covering identity and equation, attribution, and
possession. 294 Verbless clauses are never employed to either express location or existence.
Verbless clauses have the Verbless Copula Subject (VCS) and (VCC) Verbless Copula
Complement as arguments; they are expressed via juxtaposition. 295 VCS and VCC arguments
do not bear any distinctive marking (i.e. VCC cannot be marked by the usual O NP marking).
The preferred order for the constituents in verbless clauses is generally VCS ‒ VCC (carried294Cross-linguistically, such meanings are typically associated with copula clauses, see (Dixon, 2010a: 160).","[510, 511]"

6.2.1.1 S and A core arguments
The A and S arguments, together with the O arguments, form basic relations in Murui. Unlike
a prototypical object, a prototypical transitive subject is recognized as being in the A function
if it is “(…) that argument whose referent could initiate or control the activity (if anything
could)” (Dixon, 2010b: 76). There are a number of morphological and syntactic criteria in
Murui that identify the subjecthood of S and A arguments:
A. Verbal suffixes cross-reference the subject (S/A) on the predicate, e.g.:
(6.6) dɨno=koni
kokoS bɨta-da-tɨ-kokoPRED
AT.CLF:SP.PLACE=LOCAL1
1du.m lie.on.ground.TH-BODY-LK-1du.m

(6.7) nai-mɨeA
kueO ɨnɨ-ta-t-e PRED
ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M 1sg
sleep-CAUS-LK-3
‘He made me fall asleep.’
Murui nouns are usually not marked for number if the plural reference is retrievable from the
context (see §5.2). The form of the 3rd person pronominal subject marking is always -e
expressing any kind of singular or plural meanings. In (6.8) the marker -e expresses the
group’s plurality of uzutɨaɨ ‘grandfathers’. When the animacy of S/A NP is emphasized and
the argument is individualized, the predicate takes 3rd dual and plural pronominal subject
markers, as in (6.9).

‘The hospital inhabitants (lit. those of the healing house) wanted to go (there) badly.
Well, let us (two males) go to them!’
B. An NP that functions as S/A subject, can be either zero-marked or it can take the enclitic
=dɨ. O arguments are never marked with =dɨ. In (6.10), jɨko ‘dog’ is in contrastive focus (the
factors conditioning the S/A focus marking are outlined in §6.2.1.2):
(6.10) gatoS

cat.Sp come-NEG-LK-3 dog=S/A.TOP come-E.NMLZ
‘It was not the cat that came. It was the dog (lit. A cat didn’t come. The dog came.)’
C. The typical constituent order is SV and AOV where the S and A arguments are pre-posed
to the clause-final predicate. In the transitive clause of the AOV type, the placement of the O
argument is restricted and O cannot precede the A NP argument, unless it is marked for the
topical non-S/A subject case. Compare (6.11a) (with the AOV constituent order and no overt
case marking) with (6.11b) (with the AVO constituent order and the overt case marking). In
(6.11b), akiena ‘this’ is topical.

D. Murui has the S/A pivot where the S and A arguments are a common argument of two
linked clauses (so-called the ‘nominative-accusative’ S/A pivot), as in (6.12):
(6.12) PedroA nai-ñaiño-naO
kɨo-d-ePRED
Pedro ANA.SP-CLF:PR.F-N.S/A.TOP see-LK-3
‘Pedro saw her (and he) got scared.’ØS jakɨ-nai-t-ePRED
(he) scared-BECOME1-LK-3E. In addition to the criteria for recognition of the S/A subject outlined above, there are also
more associations between the S and A arguments. In Murui, the referent of both S and A is
2nd person in canonical imperative constructions (see §11.1). 191 Usually, the S and A
arguments are not explicitly stated, and they are understood from the context. The imperative
in (6.13) below is an example of an intransitive clause where the S argument is not stated.
The reported command in (6.14) illustrates a transitive clause; the A argument is covert:
(6.13) beno-mo
(Ø)S bii!PRED
HERE.CLF:SP.PLACE-LOC (2sg) come
‘(You) come here!’ (shouting at a boy running in front of the house)

‘“(You, two males) do not open this up!’ (he) said.’
6.2.1.2 Differential S/A case marking
The form of pronouns for S, A, and O arguments is the same for all the persons. There is no
morphological distinction between marking of NPs in S function of intransitive clauses, in A
function of transitive clauses, and in VCS function of verbless clauses. This is illustrated in
(6.15-17) below. (6.15) is an example of an intransitive clause with the independent pronoun
kue ‘I’ functioning as S; in the transitive clause in (6.16) kue functions as A; in the verbless191Such association applies equally to languages with accusative and with ergative marking of syntacticrelations. It is not treated as one of the criteria for S/A subjecthood in the language but merely as a confirmation
of one of a linguistic universal (Dixon, 2012).","[297, 298, 299, 300]"
"483
12.1.1 Declarative
The most frequent clause type is the declarative (affirmative). This is the ‘default’
(functionally unmarked) clause type in the language. Similary to the interrogative, the
declarative clause is not marked with any separate morpheme. The declarative vs.
interrogative distinction is made using a special intonation contour (see §2.4). The constituent
order of the declarative is usually of the AOV/SV type but it can also be determined by
pragmatic factors (with O being postposed to the clause-final verb) (this is in contrast with
dependent declarative clauses, where the constituent order appears to be rigid, being verbfinal). In natural discourse, clauses with two overtly stated arguments, A and O, are rare (see
§6.1-2). Declarative clauses in Murui are A. INTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, B. EXTENDED
INTRANSITIVE CLAUSES, C. TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, D. EXTENDED TRANSITIVE CLAUSES, and E.","[507, 508]"
"292
were painting their bodies. Some children were playing around, and painted each other more
than it was necessary. (6.76) (with the unmarked O NP) was understood as if Jose painted
only a part of the body of Maria. This was not the case in (6.77) where the body of Maria was
fully painted:
(6.76) JoseA MariaO jide-d-ePRED
Jose Maria
paint-LK-3
‘Jose painted Maria (a part of body).’
(6.77) JoseA Maria-naO
jide-d-ePRED
Jose Maria-N.S/A.TOP paint-LK-3
‘Jose painted Maria (whole body).’
Again, taken out of context, these examples have somewhat different interpretations. The
unmarked (6.76), is understood that Jose painted Maria just once, while in (6.77) Jose paints
Maria’s body every single time she wants him to.
D. EMPATHY – in a number of instances, where the O NP is topical and specific in discourse,
the explicit marking of the O NP has overtones of some type of empathy for the referent.
Compare the following examples (6.78) and (6.79). In (6.78) the referent is not topical; it is
any girl I delivered, there is no relationship between me and the girl. In (6.79), it is a child
delivered by a medicine man. According to Sandriela Agga, it is not just a child. The child is
important; it is part of the medicine man’s family. The expression has some kind of
endearment reading to it.

E. POSITION OF THE NP ON THE NOMINAL HIERARCHY – case marking of an O NP does not
seem to play any significant role in differential subject marking (but see the marking of O NP
with the dative/lovative -mo in §6.2.1.6). Pronouns with both animate and inanimate referents
can be both marked and unmarked. An example of a marked pronoun is shown in (6.80). For
an example of an unmarked pronoun oo (2sg) ‘you’ see T2.26 in the Appendix.

There is some indication however that -na does occur somewhat more frequently with
pronouns and animate nouns, than with animate nouns.
F. THE PREDICATE’S SEMANTIC GROUP – objects of verbs of perception, as well as verbs of
liking and knowing, obligatorily occur with the -na marker, as in (6.81-82), as well as (6.71)
above.

G. CONTRASTIVE FOCUS – the O NP arguments take the N.S/A.TOP marking if they are in some
kind of a contrastive focus. Example (6.83) is a mother’s recommendation to her daughter not
to buy rice but sugar in the village. 199

G. DISAMBIGUATION BETWEEN NPS – with respect to the O NP marking in Murui, in some
contexts, the topical non-S/A subject marker -na is used to disambiguate between two
arguments. See examples (6.84-85) below. If the O NP was left unmarked, rɨño ɨni could be
ambiguous as a possessive construction (‘woman’s husband’) with the A argument not stated.

order and the O argument is post-posed to the AV (AVO), it almost always receives the
topical non-S/A subject marking. This is illustrated in (6.86) where akie rafue ‘that story’ is
post-posed to the verb and therefore is topical (and in focus). (6.87) shows that the marker
-na does not solely depend on the constituent order, as in both positions (pre-V and post-V)
the O NP takes the topical non-S/A subject marker -na.","[316, 317, 318, 319]"

The occurrence of the differential object marking on O NP is related to specificity, topicality,
degree of affectedness, empathy, the predicate’s semantic group (e.g. verbs of perception),
constituent order, and, to a lesser extent, the position on the Nominal Hierarchy. These are
discussed in turn.
A. SPECIFICITY OF THE O NP – the non-subject marker appears where O NPs are referential
(or known, definite) in a given context. 196 In the following example, a speaker is talking196Nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers that take the generic classifier -e (which has ‘generic’interpretation), can further be marked with -na if their reference is retrievable from the immediate context and
specific.","[311, 312]"

4) Murui has the default SXV and AOXV constituent orders where the S/A arguments are preposed to the clause-final predicate (see §6.3 for details). If the core arguments are unmarked
for any of the core cases, the constituent order is the one that indicates the syntactic role of
the participants. In the transitive clause, the placement of the O argument is restricted in that
the O NP cannot precede the A argument but may follow the verb. When that is the case, it is
marked with the topical non-S/A subject marker. In (6.49) the O NP follows the verb and,
therefore, takes -na.

The topical non-S/A subject marker -na marks core O NPs (that are not in the addressee/
recipient function, see §6.2.1.6). An NP can take no more than a single case marker at a time
(but see the ablative marking in §6.2.2.2). The pattering of topical non-S/A subject case
marking conforms to certain grammatical and semantic restrictions conditioned by the
semantic and pragmatic status of the nominal (see the following section §6.2.1.5). The285
marker -na is a phonologically and morphologically bound form. It is also a multifunctional
marker which can mark other non-subject arguments that are frequently topical (and,
therefore, it is called the ‘topical non-S/A subject marker’). These are:
1) Time words are frequently marked with -na (see also §3.2.2), such as naɨo-na ‘night (cf.
naɨo ‘night)’, as in (6.51). Other nouns that are obligatorily marked with -na include, e.g.
mona ‘day’.

grow-LK-1sg3) The morpheme -na is one of the forms of the event nominalizer, as in (6.53) (see also
§3.1.4):
(6.53) ee~e-na (cry~RED-E.NMLZ) ‘crying (and crying)’
jaai-ñe-na (go-NEG-E.NMLZ) ‘not going’
jea -re-na (dirty-ATT-E.NMLZ) ‘being dirty’
4) It is the source for ablative -mona on nouns (see §6.2.2.2), e.g. Colombia-mona ‘from
Colombia’; on adverbial demonstratives the form of the ablative marking is -na (see §3.3.3),
e.g. bene-na (HERE.LOC:NSP-ABL) ‘from here’.
5) the topical non-S/A subject marker can be used as a topical clause linker. For instance,
constructions with the sequential dependent marker -no can be followed by the topical non-286
S/A subject -na. In (6.54), the sequential clause guajanona ‘after toasting’ and ɨmuiyanona
‘after mixing with salts’ marked with N.S/A.TOP -na are highly topical and therefore are
marked with -na (Wojtylak, forthcoming-a).

6) The topical non-S/A subject marker functions as a topical marker of clauses with
purposive meaning, as in (6.55) below. Murui purposive clauses are in fact future event
nominalizations that occur in the O function usually followed with -na. This is illustrated in

The nominalizer -ye can be the sole marker of purposive construction as well (see §12.3.1).

"1.1Linguistic profile of MuruiMurui has a relatively simple system of six vowels and seventeen consonants. The
consonantal phonemes include six stops (*p, b, t, d, k, and g), five fricatives (f, v, h, *s, and z
), two affricates (ch and y), three nasals (n, ñ, and m), and a flap (r). The voiceless labio-labial
stop *p is a marginally occurring phoneme in Murui (but still preserved in other dialects of
‘Witoto’); the voiceless apico-alveolar fricative *s, which occurs in the speech of younger
speakers, is a direct result of the Spanish influence on Murui. The vowel inventory is typical
of other languages from northern South America. All the vowels ‒ i, e, a, o, u, and ɨ ‒ have
long counterparts that are restricted to the word-initial syllables only. The high central4
unrounded vowel ɨ is an areal feature common to all languages spoken in the CaquetáPutumayo region as well as in many to the north (most Tucanoan and Carib languages)
(Aikhenvald, 2012: 109). Unlike other Witotoan languages, Murui is neither tonal, nor does it
have a complex accent system. 2 Morphophonological processes in the language involve,
among others: assimilation, voicing, vowel lengthening and shortening, and partial
reduplication. The syllable structure is of the (C)V type. Murui phonology is the focus of
Chapter 2.
In terms of language structure, Murui is nominative-accusative with head marking (on
the verb) and some elements of dependent marking (case). The language is largely
agglutinating, suffixing with some fusion. Murui has no prefixes, which distinguishes it from
other Witotoan languages (Fagua Rincón & Seifart, 2010; Wojtylak, 2016d). 3 Constituent
order within a clause is frequently determined by pragmatic factors but there is a tendency for
it to be predicate final (SV/AOV).
Murui has three open lexical word classes: nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Semi-closed
word classes are adverbs, time words, and number words. There are seven closed word
classes; these are quantifiers and intensifiers, pronouns, demonstratives, interrogative content
words, the connective ie, adpositions, and interjections. Murui word classes share numerous
properties; for instance, many of the members of the open, semi-closed, and closed word
classes can be used as heads of intransitive predicates. For instance, in (1.1), the head of the
predicate is the verb ɨba(de) ‘buy’; in (1.2) it is the noun uzuma ‘grandfather’; in (1.3) it is2With regards to the lack of tonal distinction, all ‘Witoto’ dialects are similar to Nonuya but are unlike Ocainaand other languages of the People of the Centre cultural area. Note however that only Murui and Mɨka have
fixed accent position (word-initial). Mɨnɨka and Nɨpode appear to have different patterns of accent placement.
This has lead other researchers to hypothesize that it could possibly be indicative of tonal contrasts in Mɨnɨka
(Ávila, 2016; Seifart & Fagua Rincón, 2009).
3Witotoan languages differ in terms of the number of prefixes on the verb (Wojtylak, 2016d).","[28, 29]"

Murui distinguishes between subordinate clauses (§12.3.1), and complementation (§12.3.2)
and relativization strategies (§12.3.3). Murui dependent clauses differ from main clauses in
terms of marking on verbs (verbal suffixes marking clausal dependency occur on a clausefinal verbal predicate and are mutually exclusive) and their placement with respect to the
main clause (in natural discourse, the AOV/SV constituent order in declarative clauses can be
conditioned by pragmatic factors; in dependent clauses the constituent order appears to be
rigid, verb-final).","[516, 517]"

transitive verbs are causativized in the same manner as intransitive verbs in that they are
marked with -ta. In intransitive clauses all arguments have to be present; in transitive clauses
occasionally arguments can be omitted, if they are retrievable from the context. In terms of
the syntactic possibilities of the causative of transitive clause, the CAUSER is now placed in
the A function, the original A (the CAUSEE) takes on O-marking and the original O retains the
O-marking. The A argument may be omitted if it can be inferred from the context (note the
presence of the cross-referencing pronominal subject marking on the verb). Examples are

respects:
i) the constituent order where the first O argument (kuena) precedes the original object O
(jofona) and can be preposed to the verb, as in (8.43);
ii) of the two O arguments, only the first argument has the option of being left unmarked;
the second O argument is always obligatorily marked. This makes it possible to
differentiate between the two arguments and define them further as the ‘primary’ O1 and
‘secondary’ O2. 239
The A argument, the CAUSER, may refer to either a person, an object, an event, or a state.
Murui shows no restrictions on the animacy of the CAUSER. In (8.45) below, it is the
nominalized clause ‘your funny speaking’; in (8.45) the CAUSER is the nominalized
‘sleeping’:

"10.2.4 Negation of verbless clauses
Murui verbless clauses are employed to express identity, possession, and benefaction. To
negate such clauses, intransitive predicates are used.
The core arguments of verbless clauses, Verbless Clause Subject (VCS) and Verbless
Clause Complement (VCC), are shown by adposition. VCS and VCC do not receive any450
distinctive marking. 279 The preferred order for the constituents in verbless clauses is
generally VCS - VCC (carried over from the preferred SV and AOV constituent orders).
Verbless clauses are never employed to express location or existence. Some examples are
given below:
mano-ri-raɨ-ma=dɨ]VCC
(10.76) [oo ɨni]VCS
2sg husband heal-DUR-AGT-CLF:DR.M=S/A.TOP

this.CTS-CLF:G basket-CLF:BASKET ugly-CLF:BASKET
‘This is an ugly basket (lit. this basket - ugly (basket)).’
To negate a verbless clause and to express it the future tense, former VCC’s have to function
as head of an intransitive predicate. This is illustrated in (10.79-80). Compare (10.76) above
with (10.79) below. To negate the verbless clause expressing identity with the noun in the
non-S function in (10.76) becomes a head of an intransitive predicate in (10.76), and to be
negated, it is followed by the negation marker -ñe and further predicate marking. This is
similar in examples (10.78) and (10.80).

"4.5.1Functions of classifiersThere are three major functions of classifiers in Murui: derivation of nominal stems,
formation of ‘headless’ nominal modifiers and nominalizations. In terms of discourse, Murui
classifiers serve as a reference-tracking mechanism.
The main function of Murui classifiers is derivation of new stems. They are the major
way of forming new words and enlarging the lexicon. Each classifier carries a specific
semantic load that is essential by the interpretation of the noun. Depending on the meaning of229
the referent, nouns can be associated with more than one classifier. For instance, the
independent noun yera ‘liquid tobacco (Sp. ambil)’ can occur with a variety of classifiers to
refer to and focus on its different properties; cf. Table 12.5 in Aikhenvald (2017b):
(4.103) yera-do (liquid.tobacco-CLF:POINTED)
‘yera in a pointed form (wrapped)’
yera-ji
(liquid.tobacco-CLF:WATERY)
‘yera in a liquid, viscous, sap form’
yera-fo (liquid.tobacco-CLF:CAV)
‘yera container (maraca) with a hole’
yera-ko (liquid.tobacco-CLF:COVER)
‘yera container, round’
yera-jɨ
(liquid.tobacco-CLF:SMALL.ROUND) ‘yera in form of a small ball’
yera-ru (liquid.tobacco-CLF:OVAL)
‘yera in an oval container’
yera-bɨ (liquid.tobacco-CLF:SUBS)
‘yera very thick in consistency’
yera-rue (liquid.tobacco-CLF:THINGS)
‘a lot of prepared paste of yera’
yera-rui (liquid.tobacco-CLF:DAY)
‘day of yera (when it is sent out)’
yera-bero (liquid.tobacco-CLF:DOUGH)
‘dough made out of yera’
yera-bɨrɨ (liquid.tobacco-CLF:SITE)
‘space, place where yera is kept’
yera-rojɨ (liquid.tobacco-CLF:TINY.ROUNDISH) ‘yera in form of a ball’
yera-kɨno (liquid.tobacco-CLF:NEWS)
‘word of yera (Sp. dialogo de ambil)’
yera-tiko (liquid.tobacco-CLF:BASKET)
‘basket for keeping yera’
There are semantic restrictions for various classifiers in order to be associated with different
nouns. This is determined by sociocultural conditions of the Murui world and the
environment they live in. A construction of a noun followed by a classifier has to be
meaningful in order to be grammatical, e.g. *yera-mani (liquid.tobacco-CLF:BIG.RIVER) is not
possible because yera could never have the form of a big river. Another example is ñekɨ‘chambira palm’, as in ñekɨ-na (chambira-CLF:TREE) ‘chambira palm tree’, which cannot
possibly be associated with the classifier -be ‘leaf-like shape (oval, oblong)’ because
chambira leaves have a feather-like shape for which Murui has a classifier -foro, as in ñekɨforo (chambira-CLF:FEATHER.SHAPED) ‘chambira palm feather-like shaped leave’ but never
*ñekɨ-be.
Frequently, if there is no word for an object in Murui, there may be a classifier for it.
Therefore, what Murui classifiers do is fill lexical gaps taking nominal bound forms (such as
demonstratives) and independent nouns such as raa as roots. This is especially visible in the
context of borrowing Spanish ‘concepts’ into Murui. An illustrative example of this is230
i-bani (ANA.NSP-CLF:PLANK) for ‘office desk’. Some of them seem to be more ‘established’ as
lexical terms. For instance, e.g. ra-dozi (thing-CLF:STICK) is the only way to say ‘stick’.
The generic classifier -e draws attention to another characteristic of Murui
classifiers. 165 When used, the generic -e somehow ‘neutralizes’ the meaning of physical
property classifiers (and also repeaters). An example of this is bie ‘this’ and baie ‘that’ used
during celebrations, when a man who does the distribution of gifts, and lifts them up one by
one. Those gifts are objects of diverse shapes, forms and sizes. Notably, customarily he does
not say e.g. bi-yɨ (this.CTS-CLF:PINEAPPLE) for ‘this (pineapple)’ or bi-roi (this.CTSCLF:CLOTHES) when he holds those objects up; he says bi-e (this.CTS-CLF:G) instead.","[253, 254, 255]"
"THEREMurui repeaters are similar to repeaters in other neighboring languages (Aikhenvald, 2000:
222). The main functions of Murui classifiers are derivation of nominal stems, formation of
‘headless’ nominal modifiers, and word-class changing nominalizations. They also function
as a reference-tracking mechanism (Wojtylak, 2016a, forthcoming-d). See Chapter 4 on
Murui noun structure and classifiers.
Murui possessive construction involves the Possessor (R) which can be a noun, a full
NP, or an independent pronoun, and the Possessed (D) which is frequently a noun, and
always functions as a head. Murui possessive constructions show no marking on either the R
or the D; the R and the D are simply juxtaposed within the NP with the Possessor-Possessed
constituent order, as in (1.7):
(1.7) [LusioR yoe-faiD]NP
Lucio
metal-CLF:SHORT.THICKER
‘Lucio’s machete’
Marking of the genitive -ɨe is conditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy where -ɨe occurs with 1st
and 2nd personal pronouns, e.g. kue-ɨe (1sg-GEN) ‘mine’, and the connective ie which occurs7
with 3rd person Lusio ie (Lucio CONN) ‘Lucio’s’. Murui lacks both a verb meaning ‘have’ as
well as the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession. The expression of
possession and number are discussed in Chapter 5.
Grammatical relations are expressed through differential case marking where the
marking of core arguments is related to topicality, definiteness, and affectedness. Under
special pragmatic conditions, topical S/A subject, topical non-S/A subject, and O
(recipient/addressee) arguments can be either unmarked or marked with case. Differential
marking of the O NP arguments is illustrated by (1.8-9). Grammatical relations and case
marking in Murui are the topics of Chapter 6.

‘Did you make the canoe?’ (specific)Murui has a rich system of verbal morphology, that is mostly aspectual; there is only one
(future) tense marker. Example (1.10) shows numerous verbal categories expressed on the
verb joko(de) ‘wash’. They include aspectual, directional, modal, and evidential marking.
(1.10) joko-ri-zai-aka-ñe-itɨ-kue=dɨ
wash-DUR-ANDTV-DES-NEG-FUT.LK-1sg=CERT
‘I WILL not want to go washing.’
Murui has one evidential, the reported =ta. Witotoan languages differ with respect to
expression of evidential meanings, but they do appear to share at least one evidentiality value
– the reported evidential. In that respect, the Witotoan languages are similar to other
languages spoken in the Caquetá-Putumayo region, such as Boran (Wojtylak, forthcoming-c).
Languages located to the north usually have more ‘elaborate’ systems of evidentials
(Aikhenvald, forthcoming-b; Carlin, forthcoming; Stenzel & Gomez-Imbert, forthcoming).
The Murui predicate structure as well as the expression of non-spatial (TAME) and spatial8
(andative and ventive) settings on the verb is discussed in Chapter 7.
Murui has one type of morphological valency-reducing mechanisms – the passive,
and two types of valency-increasing mechanisms – the causative and the double causative.
Murui passive construction puts the underlying O argument into S function and places
underlying A argument in a peripheral (oblique) function. Reflexive and reciprocal meanings
are periphrastic expressions that involve ‘headless’ nominal modifiers and the possessed
noun abɨ ‘body’. The reciprocal meanings are expressed with the bound form koni‘between’. A prototypical Murui causative derivation applies to an S argument and places it
in a derived O function. The causative carries the possibility of being applied twice (double
causative). It applies to both underlying intransitive and transitive clauses forming derived
extended transitives. Valency-changing mechanisms are discussed in Chapter 8.
Murui adjectives belong to the open word class, and share various properties with
verbs and nouns. With verbs, they share a limited set of verbal affixes, such as the attributive
markers, e.g. jano-re-d-e (small-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it) is small’. They can also take classifiers to
form ‘headless’ nominal modifiers. As such, they take no verbal marking, e.g. ebi-fue (niceCLF:STORY) ‘nice story’. Additionally, Murui has a small closed word class that consists of afew ‘underived’ adjectives (including mare ‘good’, aare ‘long’, aiyo- ‘big’, jaka- ‘old’, and
komo- ‘new’). They have different morphosyntactic properties than those that belong to the
open word class. The majority of Murui comparative constructions are monoclausal, where
the PARAMETER of comparative construction (usually an adjective) is followed by the
STANDARD and standard marker (S-MARK) of comparison. In (1.11), what is being comparedis naiñaiño ‘she’. The STANDARD is what naiñaiño is compared against, kue ‘me’. The
property that is compared (PARAMETER) is the adjective jano- ‘small’, that is further modified
with the P- MARK eo ‘very’. The marker of the grammatical function of the STANDARD, the SMARK, is baaɨfemo ‘over there, ahead of’.","[31, 32, 33]"
"390
The default order of the constituents is AO1O2V, where the A and the first O
arguments are in the CAUSER function and the second O argument is the CAUSEE. Oblique
arguments are usually expressed in clause initial positions, and somewhat less often in clause
final positions, as in (8.69):

Similarly to the causative, the double causative shows no restrictions regarding the animacy
of the CAUSER, as in (8.71). The double causative has occasionally overtones of some type of
cultural obligation. The reading of (8.71) is an invitation that one has to obey. If not, one has
to make amends later on.

As mentioned previously, the possibilities of both the causative -ta and the double

types of morphological causatives they occur with. These possibilities are outlined here:391
A. Verbs which occur with the CAUSATIVE -ta BUT NEVER WITH THE DOUBLE CAUSATIVE -tata

B. VERBS WHICH CONTAIN THE ELEMENT -ta AND CANNOT OCCUR WITH THE DOUBLE

C. VERBS WHICH DO NOT OCCUR WITH THE CAUSATIVE -ta BUT DO OCCUR WITH THE DOUBLE
CAUSATIVE -tata – the majority of such verbs are strictly intransitive, e.g. i(te) ‘exist’, bi(te)‘come’, rai(te) ‘say’, ñaɨ(te) ‘speak’, raaɨ(de) ‘sit’, zai(te) ‘step’. Some are ambitransitive:

6.2.1.8 Double case marking
All types of Murui verbs can be subject to derivations which increase valency and participate
in causative derivation. Murui has a morphological mechanism, which allows for the
causative -ta to be applied twice yielding a causative of a causative ‒ the double causative
that forms the contiguous -ta-ta string of suffixes (see §8.2.2). (6.100-101) show the
derivation mechanism of a ‘simple’ causative.

3.4SummaryThe morphosyntactic characteristics of nouns, verbs, and adjectives are compared with those
of the closed classes in Table 3.4 below. 139 If a member of a word-class has to be derived in
order to occur in a certain function, it is marked with an asterisk. In Murui, a member of the
majority of word classes can be used as head of an intransitive predicate; however, only verbs
can be used as heads of transitive predicates. As such, they can occur with a rich array of
verbal suffixes. The occurrence of verbal suffixes with other word classes is limited, with
adjectives showing the greatest number of possibilities. Nouns are prototypical heads of an
NP; open and closed word classes have to have certain derivational processes applied to them
to function as heads of an NP (i.e. verbs and adjectives have to be nominalized; the majority
of the members of closed word classes have to take a classifier).","[201, 202]"

and riddles (Echeverri, 1997: 79). 29 Each ‘Witoto’ clan had its own totem that identified their
apical ancestor with animals, plants, cultural objects, or natural phenomena (Gasché, 2009c:
12). To an extent, this practise is still true today. For instance, nowadays, during important
traditional festivals and celebrations, roofs of malocas may occasionally be painted with
totemic symbols that represent certain clans.
Male dominance (especially the father and father’s brother) played a crucial role in a
child’s upbringing. In the case of a father’s death, the responsibility for a child (both
emotional and physical) was transferred to izo, the father’s brother (but never mother’s
brother) (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 75). Nevertheless, the mother was always an important
person in the life of a child, as she was compelled to care for the infant. The maternal family
was not expected to take part in the upbringing of the child but they could have a casual
relationship with the young ones. The mother’s brothers and sisters were not considered to
play any significant role in a child’s life, as they were members of a different consanguineous
group. Among the ‘Witoto’ people, the birth order determined a child’s status in the family.
For instance, when a man died, his possessions were transferred to his first son. If he had no
son, they would be given to his aama ‘brother’, followed by mirɨño ‘sister’, komoma ‘son of
his sister’ and a enaize ‘nephew’ (in that order) (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 81-82) (see also
§1.3.4 on kinship terminology).
Traditionally, the division of labour between the ‘Witoto’ women and men was clearcut and, in some respects, it was also a matter of taboo. Following Whiffen (1915: 67), in
addition to being ‘the wife, the mother, the cook, and the housekeeper’, the woman was29As of 1909, Pinell (1928: 228-229) reported the existence of at least 136 ‘Witoto’ clans. Almost a centurylater the number has decreased to 76 (Echeverri, 1997: 77). For Murui there are officially 32 clans in existence
(OIMA, 2008: 29-31).","[55, 56]"
"13.1 Repetition of phrases and clauses
Murui discourse is full of phrasal and clausal repetitions that are often verbatim. Such
repetitions emphasize significance of a phrase, clause, or a sentence within texts. They have
mostly aspectual meanings (i.e. reiteration of an action, its prolonged duration, intensity and
emphasis). Repetition is different from bridging constructions (discussed in §13.2) in that it is
not used to organize discourse; rather it can be considered an aspectual strategy of a sort.
In Murui, phrases and sentences are commonly repeated up to three times, especially in
narratives. An example of verbatim repetitions is presented in (13.1), a textual excerpt from a
story about preparations for traditional celebrations in the maloca. By means of the repetition
of words and phrases, the speaker emphasizes the importance of the travel they undertook in
order not to arrive for the celebration empty-handed, at the same time, making a clear
reference to the prolonged duration and the intensity of their journey (repeated clauses and
sentences are in bold).",[538]

Oblique arguments are usually preposed to the verb; occasionally they are also expressed in
clause final positions (this is similar to double causative constructions, see §8.2.2).
Murui causative -ta applies to all sorts of verbs. In addition to intransitive,
ambitransitive, and strictly transitive verbs illustrated in the previous examples, it can also
apply to adjectives as well when they are followed by the attributive -re/-ni or the markers
meaning ‘become’ (-nai, -tai, and -dai), as in (8.54-56).The Murui causative cannot occur on

"5.1.1Marking in possessive constructionsMarking of possession in Murui involves a simple juxtaposition of words within the NP that
requires the Possessor - Possessed order. The apposition within an NP is discussed in
§5.1.1.1. There is a split between 1st and 2nd vs. 3rd person pronouns in the VCC function with
regards to their genitive marking (see §5.1.1.2). An alternative way of expressing possession
involves nominal forms, with pronouns followed by classifiers (§5.1.1.3).",[263]
"56
Murui has an interesting technique for avoiding names when talking about a person. 49
It involves reducing a number of syllables of a proper noun and their transposition. This
technique stems from the time of orphanages in La Chorrera (see §1.5), and was used by
‘Witoto’ speakers to refer to nuns and priests, in order to avoid being understood and
punished. Nowadays, this technique is used for all kinds of purposes, and can also be used for
one’s nickname. Rafɨ in (1.36) is an example of such an alternation:
(1.36) Fransiska > Fɨra > Rafɨ1.4Linguistic affiliationMurui is a dialect/linguistic variety of ‘Witoto’, which belongs to the Witotoan language
family. Some scholars consider the Witotoan languages to be related to the neighboring
Boran language family. Whether the Boran and the Witotoan languages are genetically
related is a controversial issue. Aschmann (1993) did a comparative study of the Boran and
Witotoan language families, and tried to prove the relationship between the two families,
which he called ‘Proto-Witotoan’. His hypothesis was challenged by yet another attempt at a
reconstruction of a proto language but not enough evidence was found to prove a genetic
relationship between these language (Seifart & Echeverri, 2011, forthcoming). Currently,
most linguists follow Aschmann’s account adopting it as a working hypothesis.
The division of languages within the Witotoan language family is a matter of
consensus. The family constitutes three languages, ‘Witoto’, Ocaina (with a population of49This practise is different from secret name tabooes given at birth, such as those among the Trio in Suriname(Carlin, 2004), or taboos on the names of the dead among many Panoan groups (Aikhenvald, 2012: 363; Fleck,
2013).","[80, 81]"
"12.1 Types of independent clauses
Murui does not have separate morphological systems that would cover the declarative, the
interrogative, and the imperative. The three major speech acts ‒ statements, commands, and
questions ‒ are differentiated by intonation contours and presence (or lack) of certain special
markers. Constituent order does not correlate with sentence types in the language.
This section discusses independent clauses, which form a complete utterance in Murui;
this is unlike dependent clauses which are embedded within the main clause (§12.3).
Independent clauses are the declarative, the interrogative, and imperative. 293 There are a
number of declarative clause types which differ in their ability to occur with certain verbal
categories, especially tense, aspect, and evidentiality. Each clause type is discussed in turn.",[507]

6.2.1.3 O core arguments
The O argument in Murui is defined as the non-S/A core argument. Semantically, in
transitive clauses, A arguments can potentially initiate or control the activity. As Dixon
(2010b: 76) put it: “And if there is something which is saliently affected by the activity, the
argument referring to this will be in the O function.” O arguments in Murui are recognized
based on the following morphological and syntactic criteria:
1) The O argument is expressed only ‘outside’ the predicate (unlike the S/A arguments that
are cross-referenced on the predicate and oblique arguments), as in (6.38):

nominalizations, pronouns, and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers of all types). The sentence in194The same form of the accusative case marker -na also occurs in Aguaruna (Jivaroan/Chicham) spoken inPeru. In Aguaruna -na marks both O and E arguments, unlike in Murui (Overall, 2008: 215). In Hup (Makú)
spoken in the Vaupés it has the form -an (Epps, 2005). There is also a multifunctional -na marker in Tariana
which marks objects and recipients on pronouns (Aikhenvald, 2003).","[305, 306, 307]"
"All sentences have been analyzed following four principles (Dixon, 2010b: 61). All multiword constituents are indicated within square brackets, all verbal arguments and core
constituents ‒ A (transitive subject), S (intransitive subject), and O (transitive object) ‒ are
labled for their syntactic function. Additionally, locative and other oblique arguments are
occasionally labelled to make these arguments immediately understandable for the reader.
Each morpheme is glossed. Where possible, morpheme boundaries are shown by hyphens;
where non-segmentable morphemes (e.g. due to some morphophonological changes, or lack
of one-to-many correspondences) are separated by periods in English glosses (see also the

"12.3.1 Subordinate clauses and clause linking
There are a number of morphosyntactic mechanisms in Murui to specify independent clauses
by means of dependent ones. Such biclausal linking include seven distinct semantic types:
sequential, temporal, posteriority and anteriority, overlap, conditional, purposive, and reason.
The type of linking is expressed by grammatical markers and postpositions within a
dependent clause. Overall, nominalizations appear to be the most frequent means of forming
dependent clauses of any semantic type. Depending on their type, dependent clauses can be
found pre-posed or post-posed to the main clause. Under specific pragmatic conditions, the
order of the clauses can be reversed. This section discusses the semantic types of Murui
subordinate clauses focusing on their morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties.
Murui clause linking constructions are summarized in Table 12.1 below.",[517]
"The overt marking of the core cases is conditioned by both discourse and alignment of
constituent order in the clause. Murui non-core arguments are optional and can be included in
either clause type. These oblique arguments are: locative, ablative, instrumental, benefactivecausal, and privative. Marking of the non-core cases is usually mandatory (see §6.2.2.1 on the
omission of the locative).
Each NP takes a single case marker at a time. This is the case for any kind of case
marker (core or non-core). Murui case markers are always suffixed to the final element (the
head) of an NP (see §3.1 on the noun structure and §4.1 on the structure of Murui NP).",[297]

This chapter deals with grammatical relations and case marking in Murui. General
characteristics of grammatical relationships are discussed in §6.1. The following section deals
with semantics, marking, and functions of core arguments (discussed in §6.2.1) and oblique

I owe my deepest gratitude to my academic supervisors, Alexandra Aikhenvald and R.M.W.
Dixon, for their patience and constant support as well as their personal guidance that made
the completion of this thesis possible. Alexandra Aikhenvald has given me a vivid interest in
the Amazonian Linguistics. Her outstanding knowledge of the topic of the South American
languages (and beyond) has motivated and guided my work from the very beginning towards
the very end. At the heart of this thesis lies the monumental work of R.M.W. Dixon, Basic
Linguistic Theory. R.M.W. Dixon, a scholar of unparalleled knowledge of the world’s
languages, and a most generous mentor over the years.
I am grateful to all the members of the The Language and Culture Research Centre at James
Cook University: Elena Mihas, Mikko Salminen, Luca Ciucci, Lourens de Vries, Willem
Adelaar, Simon Overall, Maria Wronska-Friend and Tony Friend, Mateus Carvalho, Ryan
Pennington, Firew Worku, Grant Aiton, Joseph Brooks, Juliane Böttger, Howard and Colleen
Oates, Cassy Nancarrow, Dineke Schokkin, Azeb Amha, Diana Forker, Nerida Jarkey, Nick
Piper, Angeliki Alvanoudi, and Valérie Guérin. Special thanks to Brigitta Flick for checkingx
the thesis for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Additionally, I would also like to thank
Katrina Keith, Liz Tynan, and Jolene Overall.
My gratitude goes to my colleagues and friends from various parts of the world: Emilienne
Ireland, Leo Wetzels, Juan Alvaro Echeverri, Gabriele Petersen de Piñeros, Jon Landaburu,
Antoine Guillaume, Pilar Valenzuela, Patience Epps, Mary Ruth Wise, Nerida Jarkey, Lev
Michael, Felix Ameka, Katherine Bolaños, José Ramón Álvarez González, Yvonne Treis,
Oscar Iván García, Frank Seifart, David Felipe Guerrero, Alain Fabre, Marco Tobón, Camilo
Robayo, Doris Fagua, Youlin Avila, Felipe Sarmiento, and many more.
Aside from the academic environment, I would like to thank my own family and friends back
home. In particular I must mention my mother and father, Krystyna and Grzegorz, who
installed in me a deep love and appreciation for languages and adventure. My sister, Ewa
Gracja, was always by my side in my thoughts and heart. Zawsze i wszędzie za Tobą tęsknię.
A teraz z myślami jestem także z częścią Ciebie i Adama: małym Antonim Kazimierzem.
Tato i mamo: oгромное вам спасибо, я вам очень признательнa и благодарнa. От всей
души благодарю вас за оказанную помощь, поддержку и понимание. Пусть за вашу
доброту и щедрость вам вoздacтся сполна.
To Kristian Lupinski for his companionship and endearing support. The years spent together
have been an amazing adventure for both of us. You have always motivated me to improve
myself and kept me safe. I am in debt to you for your care and love you have given me
throughout the years.
Many thanks to my dearest friends Marta Robinska, Paola Colombo, Monika Franczyk,
Diana Corredor, Leidy Morales, Małgorzata Gradowska, Daniela Vavrová, Chiara Bresciani,
Christiane Falck, Alexander König, Chris Becker, my Colombian parents: Francisco Alonso
and Paola Porras of the Malokamazonas Hotel in Leticia, my brother: Juan Alonso, Bård
Aaberge, André Moreira, Julio Ugarte, Kamil Kosiński, Mike Magyarosi, Luis Miguel RojasBerscia, André Nikulin Guzmán, Shaun Brack, and Leon Faloon, whose friendship and
companionship during all these years have enriched my life not only in the Netherlands and
Australia, but also elsewhere in the world in ways I had never expected. And to everybody
who has been part of my life in different ways. At times, we may be long distances apart but
eventually our paths always cross.
Thank you all, Kasiaxi

Po każdej wojnie
ktoś musi posprzątać
Jaki taki porzadek
sam się przecież nie zrobi.
(...)
Ktoś czasem jeszcze
wykopie spod krzaka
przeżarte rdzą argumenty
i poprzenosi je na stos odpadków.
Ci, co wiedzieli
o co tutaj szło,
muszą ustąpić miejsca tym,
co wiedzą mało.
I mniej niż mało.
I wreszcie tyle co nic.
W trawie, która porosła
przyczyny i skutki,
musi ktoś sobie leżeć
z kłosem w zębach
i gapić się na chmury.

Chapter they are in (e.g. example ‘(1.5)’ refers to Chapter 1, example 5). Examples have
three lines. The first line is orthographic and breaks up each word into morphemes. The
second line shows morpheme-level glosses. SMALL CAPS are used for grammatical glosses.
Proper names are reproduced throughout the glossing. The final line provides a free
translation into English. The free translations are as idiomatic as possible; parentheses
complement contextual meaning of the free translations. If an example is to be found in the
text in the Appendix, it is marked with ‘TextNumber.SentenceNumber’, as in (T3.3).
In the text, verbs are given in a citation form, where the predicate marker (-dɨ/-tɨ) is
followed by the 3rd person pronominal subject marker -e. For instance, the verb ‘write’ is
presented as kue(te) ‘write’, where kue- is a verbal root. Punctuation depend on the pauses in
speaker’s speech after the sentence is considered to have been completed. Clauses and
sentences are not capitalized. When one word has several different meanings, the most
appropriate one is given in the gloss. ‘Headless’ nominal modifiers that are used as heads of
intransitive predicates are often shown in brackets to indicate non-verbal forms used
intransitively, e.g. [mare-ko]-d-e (good.ATT-CLF.REP.DOG-LK-3) ‘it’s a good (dog)’.
The quotation marks placed around the term Witoto are done at the request of the
Murui, Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode people. ‘Witoto’ subsumed these four separate groups. The
term Witotoan refers to the language family (that consists of ‘Witoto’, Ocaina, and Nonuya).
Throughout the chapters, there are a few numbering gaps, as some examples were
eliminated in the final stage of the revision process.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
344There was a certain hierarchical order in which particular clans and groups would bathe.,[600]

13.3.3 Songs
The Murui have a fascinating repertoire of songs (Wojtylak, 2017a). Many songs are
‘borrowed’ from other (related and unrelated) groups, among them the Carijona (for the
celebration of the rɨaɨ rua ‘non-Witoto Songs’), the Andoque, the Ocaina, and the Bora
(Urbina Rangel, 1997). Murui songs are characterized by frequently occurring fixed
structures and common patterns (Wojtylak, 2017a). For instance, songs from the muruikɨ
genre have many interjections such as jɨɨ, jii, juu, or jaa throughout the entire song.
Moreover, each song has a formulaic ending that involve words from other varieties of
‘Witoto’, such as Mɨnɨka, Mɨka, and Nɨpode. Each type of songs has a special rhythm and
intonation that can distinguish pitch; this is similar to the rhythm and pitch distinguished by
the Murui manguaré (Wojtylak, forthcoming-e). An example of a Mɨka formulaic song
ending is given in (13.29). Although, as a whole, it is difficult to translate. 313 Note the
occurrence of the Mɨka interrogative content word mɨka meaning ‘what, something/nothing’
and mookei for ‘father’ in Mɨka. 314 A part of the expression nɨfo reiñededɨ can be translated
as ‘he didn’t say anything’, with the interrogative content word nɨfo ‘what’, which points to
its origin in one of the Mɨka clans. 315313Murui people refuse to translate songs; rather, they interpret them instead. Many of the words in the songsrequire a special knowledge in order to understand them.
314In Mɨka the form kei refers to ‘mother’ (ei Murui and Mɨnɨka). Moo means ‘father’. Mookei can beinterpreted as ‘parents’. Note however that the element k- in all Witotoan languages (Witoto, Nonuya, and
Ocaina) seems to be related to 1sg marker. The form kei might therefore be an archaic form bearing the
possessive prefix k-. Thus, the Mɨka form kei might be better interpreted as ‘my mother’.
315Speech varieties of ‘Witoto’, including clanolects, are distinguished by their expression of the interrogativecontent word meaning ‘what’ (see §1.4).","[556, 557]"
"5.1Possession ‒ general characteristicsMurui possessive construction involves the Possessor (R) which can be a noun, a ‘headless’
nominal modifier, or an independent pronoun, and the Possessed (D) which is frequently a
noun or a ‘headless’ nominal modifier, and functions always as head. Both the R and the D
can be modified by a demonstrative and an adjective. There is no marking on the R and the
D; they are simply juxtaposed within the NP with the Possessor-Possessed constituent order.
(5.1-2) are examples of a noun and a pronoun in the R functions:
(5.1) [LusioR yoe-faiD]NP
Lucio
metal-CLF:SHORT.THICKER
‘Lucio’s machete’
(5.2) [kueR yofue-raɨ-ñaiñoD]NP
1sg
teach-AGT-CLF:DR.F
‘my (female) teacher’
NP possessive constructions are marked in the same way regardless of the nature of R (that
is, R can be a pronoun or a noun (either a common proper, or kinship noun, with either
human, animate, or inanimate referents, loans, etc.) (see §5.1.2). Such possessive
constructions function as arguments of predicates, or head an intransitive predicate.
Verbless possessive constructions involve the R (and, often, the D) followed by the
connective ie that refers to the R anaphorically. Examples (5.3-4) are illustrative of this. (5.3)
is verbless possessive construction with the R and D elements expressed in the clause. (5.4) is237
a verbless possessive construction with the omitted D. Verbless possessive constructions,
such as (5.3), are frequently used as answers to the question bu-e bai-e? (Q1-CLF:G that.FSHCLF:G) ‘what is this? (lit. what - that)’ while constructions such as in (5.4) are used as repliesto buu ie bai-e? (Q1 CONN that.FSH-CLF:G) ‘whose is this (lit. who his/hers - that)?’ (see
§5.1.3.3).

Additionally, Murui has a construction which involves a morphological process of affixation
where the genitive -ɨe is applied to pronouns. Such form function as arguments of verbless
clauses; they can also head an intransitive predicate. The marking of the genitive is
conditioned by the Nominal Hierarchy, where the 1st and 2nd person pronouns (singular, dual,
and plural) in R function are marked with -ɨe, as in (5.5). 3rd person pronouns referring to the
R are marked with the connective ie, as in (5.6). The genitive marker is discussed in §5.1.1.2.

ANA.SP-CLF:PR.M CONNMurui lacks a verb ‘have’. Stating relationship of possession in the language is achieved
through predicative possessive constructions that involve markers on nouns and express
attribution or its lack (see §5.1.3.1), and the intransitive verb i(te) ‘exist’ where the R is
marked with the locative case (see §5.1.3.2). Another way to express possessive meaning is
through a verbless clause marked with the connective ie, as illustrated in (5.6) above (see
§5.1.3.3 for details).","[261, 262]"

4.1Noun structureThe Murui noun phrase (NP) can be defined as a grammatical constituent that functions as an
argument of a predicate. Murui noun phrases can also head intransitive predicates. The head
of a simple NP can be a single noun, which can be modified by other nouns, adjectives,
quantifiers, pronouns, demonstratives, interrogatives, and number words. The head of an NP
follows the modifier, as illustrated in (4.1-2). Adjectives always follow the head noun, as
illustrated in (4.6) and (4.11) further in this section.

chicken woman-CLF:DR.F

are formed from other word classes by means of classifiers (suffixes); noun head is not stated.
This is illustrated with the classifier-repeater -ko for ‘dog’ (from jɨko ‘dog’) in (4.3). These
also include nominalizations (see §3.1.4) and possessive constructions (see §5.1.1), as in
(4.4).

Structurally, Murui nouns are less ‘complex’ than verbs. They allow up to three structural
positions, which can be filled simultaneously, and are marked only once. The structural
positions are: 140
(a) Classifiers (discussed in this chapter),
(b) Number (plural, kinship plural, collective, see Chapter 5),
(c) Case (topical S/A, topical non-S/A subject, locative, instrumental, ablative,
benefactive-causal, and privative, see Chapter 6 on grammatical relations).
The structure of a Murui noun illustrating noun slots is given in Scheme 3.1 in §3.1.1.
‘Headless’ nominal modifiers are formed with various members of open, semi-closed, and
closed word classes by means of classifiers. They can take further number and case marking
(see §3.1.1). An illustrative example of a nominal with an adjectival root, followed by an
animate classifier and a case marker is given in (4.5) (see also §9.1 on NPs with adjectival
roots).

‘Do you know (those) beautiful (females)?’Within an NP that contains a modifier followed by a noun, modifiers usually do not agree
with the head noun (but see also (5.105) in §5.2.2); modifying elements are always marked
with the generic classifier -e, regardless of the number or animacy of the noun, as illustrated
with the demonstrative bai- ‘that’ in (4.6) below:140There are a number of dependencies between noun classes, number, and classifier types in their co-occurrence (see §4.2.2.3 and §5.2).","[202, 203, 204, 205]"
"2.1.2VowelsThe Murui vowel system consists of six oral vowels. Every vowel has a long vowel
counterpart that is phonemic in the language. Murui vowel phonemes are shown in Table 2.3:
Table 2.3 Murui vowels
FRONT
HIGH
OPEN-MID
LOWCENTRALBACKSHORTLONGSHORTLONGSHORTLONGi [i]
e [ɛ]ii [i:]
ee [ɛ:]ɨ [ɯ]ɨɨ [ɯ:]u [u]
o [ɔ]uu [u:]
oo [ɔ:]a [a]aa [a:]Murui vowels consist of three high vowels (front i, central ɨ, and back u), two mid-open
vowels (front e and back o), and one low central a. While only the high back vowel u and the83
mid-open o are rounded, the rest are unrounded. Each of the short vowels can form a syllable
nucleus and can be preceded by any type of consonant or vowel. When short vowels are
stressed, they have high pitch (see also §2.2).
All of the Murui short vowels have their own long counterparts that are restricted to the
word-initial position only. They can constitute a syllable on their own or with a consonant in
the onset. Long vowels are stressed and have high pitch. An interesting feature of the long
vowels is that they trigger the predicate linker -dɨ (rather than -tɨ), rii(de) ‘arrive’, cf. e.bi(te)
‘come’. Such long vowel could be considered to be two copies of the same vowel in
succession. The current Murui orthography (see §2.8) follows the convention to write long
vowels using two short vowels, e.g. riide ‘arrive’ instead of ri:de ‘arrive’. This work will not
deviate from this commonly accepted orthographic ‘tradition’.
A. SHORT VOWELS ‒ the high front short vowel i is found in all positions. In nominal and
verbal roots, it can be followed by any consonant, e.g. irai ‘fire’, ibiraɨ ‘trunk of the ibina
tree’, jiza ‘daughter’, i-ya-no (exist-E.NMLZ-CLF:SP.PLACE) ‘place of living, existence’, bi(te)
‘come’, faɨfi(de) ‘lose’. It can occur in any position within a word. In fact, the occurrence of
the high front vowel is very frequent with the formation of nouns (by means of the ‘dummy’
anaphoric element i-), e.g. i-kɨ (ANA.NSP-CLF:ROUND) ‘a small, round object (e.g. heart,
fruit)’, i-do (ANA.SP-CLF:POINTED) ‘a very small, pointed object (e.g. seed, tooth)’, i-na
(ANA.SP-CLF:TREE) ‘an object that has the form of a tree’, i-da (ANA.NSP-CLF:LONG.STRAIGHT)
‘long and straight objects (e.g. crutches)’. The high front short vowel i occurs also frequently
in various types of verbal affixes, such as -i (future tense, emphatic), -ia (conditional), -ni
(negative attributive), -ri (durative), and -kabi (habitual). Although in principle, there are no
restrictions on co-occurrence with other vowels, the phoneme i is rarely followed by the high84
central vowel (e.g. iɨfe ‘tongue’) and by the high back vowel (e.g. iugoe ‘type of plant’).
The short high central vowel ɨ is found in all positions. It can occur word-initially in
underived nominal and verbal roots, e.g. ini ‘husband’, rɨ(te) ‘eat meat’, ri(te) ‘plant’, ɨnɨ(de)
‘sleep’, as well as word-medially, as in jeikɨ(te) ‘give birth’. It can also occur in functional
words, such as dɨga ‘with’, nɨ-ga (Q2-QUANT) ‘how much?’. Word-finally, it occurs in various
types of affixes and clitics, such as kome-ki (person-CLF:ROUND) ‘heart’ and =dɨ (topical S/A
subject marker).
The short high back vowel u is found in all possible positions in roots, affixes, and
enclitics, e.g. uzu-ma (grandparent-CLF:DR.M) ‘grandfather’, uku-be (money-CLF:LEAF)
‘money’, uku-du (star-CLF:HILL) ‘star’, yunu(de) ‘make an object by hand (e.g. a basket)’,
du(te) ‘chew coca’, -ru (CLF:OVAL), -yu (CLF:BAG), and -buku (CLF:LONG.BASKET).
The mid-open front vowel e is found in all positions. This is illustrated by e.g. efa
‘macaw’, ebi-re-d-e (nice-ATT-LK-3) ‘nice’, ñe(te) ‘do’, de(te) ‘cut open’, jeno(de) ‘search’.
The mid-open back vowel o has no restrictions and occur in positions within a noun
and verb, such as o(te) ‘get’, moto ‘centre’. It also occurs in affixes and clitics, e.g. -mo
(locative), -no (CLF:SP.PLACE), -bero (CLF:DOUGH), -foro (CLF:FEATHER.SHAPE), -ño
(CLF:DR.F), -kɨno (CLF:NEWS), -no (semelfactive), -o (2nd person singular pronominal subject
marker), and -omɨko (2nd person plural pronominal subject marker).
The low central vowel a can be found word-initially, medially-, and finally-, e.g. jaka
‘always, never’, kaka(de) ‘hear, understand, warm coca vessel’, -ka (passive), -na (topical
non-S/A subject marker, ablative, CLF:TREE), =ta (reported evidential), -ma (CLF:DR.M), -da
(CLF:LONG.STRAIGHT), and -nita (CLF:ELONGATED).","[107, 108, 109]"
"8.3Reflexive and reciprocalIn a reflexive construction, transitive subject A and transitive object O coincide; a reciprocal
clause describes “(…) several instances of an activity such that what is A argument in one
instance is O argument in another” (Dixon, 2012: 475). Murui has no ‘dedicated’
constructions for reflexive or reciprocal, but a set of mechanisms through which reflexive and
reciprocal meanings are expressed (there are no affixes marking reflexive and reciprocal
derivations on the verb). The language employs a similar technique to express reflexive and
reciprocal meanings. It involves:
– free informative markers (‘headless’ nominal modifiers; these are bound forms
followed by animate classifiers that refer to S/A NP arguments cross-referenced on the
verb), and
– the possessed noun abɨ ‘body’.",[416]

arguments and have ambitransitive and strictly transitive verbs as their predicates. Murui
amtransitive verbs can be used in both intransitive and transitive clauses (see §3.1.2). In both
types of clauses, the S/A argument of the verb can be marked with the topical S/A subject
marker =dɨ (see §6.2.1.1 on differential S/A case marking). The O argument, if present, can
either be left unmarked or carry the topical non-S/A subject marking -na (see also §6.2.1.5 on
differential object marking). This is illustrated in (12.10), where the ‘headless’ nominal
modifier naie ‘that’ takes the topical non-S/A subject marker -na:

order’ (see example (8.63) in §8.2.1), jɨka(de) ‘request’, jɨkano(te) ‘ask’, jitai(de) ‘need,
want, desire’, and ɨɨno(te) ‘obey’. Murui can also express commands without using dedicated
imperative forms. Such command strategies are discussed in §11.1.4.",[484]
"10.1 Negation ‒ general characteristics
Negation in Murui involves the morphological process of affixation, where a negative marker
is added to a corresponding positive in main and subordinate clauses. Negation of predicates
is expressed in two different ways: with the standard negative marker -ñe (slot 10 on the verb
structure, see Scheme 7.1 in §7.1) and with the negative attributive -ni ‘lack of attribution
(ability, property, possession)’ (slot 11, cf. the mutually exclusive positive attributive -re for
having ‘attribution (ability, property, possession’). The Murui negative markers with their
corresponding positive equivalents are illustrated in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 Murui positive and negative markers
Positive Negative
–
-ñe
General
-re
-ni
Attributive
Compare the positive and negative constructions in (10.1a-b). The structure of ɨɨ(de) ‘swim’
does not differ from the ‘affirmative’ in (10.1a) with the exception of the addition of the
standard negative marker -ñe in (10.1b):430
(10.1) a. ɨɨ-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-LK-1sg
‘I swim’
b. ɨɨ-ñe-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG-LK-1sg
‘I don’t swim’
Examples (10.2a-b) illustrate the positive and the negative constructions with the attributive
markers -re (‘positive attributive’) and -ni (‘negative attributive’) that follow the verbal root
ɨɨ- ‘swim’. Depending on the marker, they mean roughly ‘to have the ability to swim’ and
‘not to have the ability to swim’:
(10.2) a. ɨɨ-re-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can swim (e.g. I am feeling healthy enough to swim)’
b. ɨɨ-ni-dɨ-kuePRED
swim-NEG.ATT-LK-1sg
‘I can’t swim (e.g. because I am sick)’
Depending on the word class they occur with, the attributive markers have different
semantics. They involve ‘ability’, as in (10.2a-b) above, but can also refer to ‘property’ and
‘possession’. The semantics of Murui attributive markers is outlined in Table 10.2.

VERBS
[+ ability]

ADJECTIVES
[+ property]

NOUNS
[+ possession]
[– possession]Generally, the positive attributive -re, as in moko-re-d-e (green-ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) green’,
cannot be negated with either of the negative markers. The positive attributive -re occurs in
the same structural slot as the negative attributive -ni (see §3.1.3). Nowadays, younger
speakers of Murui occasionally negate the positive attributive -re with the standard negative
marker -ñe, yielding constructions such as moko-re-ñe-d-e (green-ATT-NEG-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not431
green’. Older speakers accept only negative constructions with the negative attributive -ni, as
in moko-ni-d-e (green-NEG.ATT-LK-3) ‘(it’s) not green’. The standard negative and the
attributive markers are used in slightly different environments. While the attributive markers
occur on verbs, adjectives, and nouns, the standard negative -ñe occurs on verbs and nouns
only (with adjectives, the negative attributive is used instead of the standard negative marker
-ñe). The occurrence of Murui attributive and standard negative markers with verbs,
adjectives, and nouns is given in Table 10.3 below.

yesNegation is shown by a single negation marker within a clause (see the privative §10.2.5).
See for instance example (10.3) below. Generally, negating clausal constituents other than
nominalizations is uncommon.
(10.3) [Kata [Maria dɨga]]S jaka bi-ñe-d-ePRED
Kata Maria WITH
never come-NEG-LK-3
‘Neither Katarina nor Maria came (lit. Kata with Maria never came).’
A constituent of a negated clause may bear additional stress. Additionally, the topical S/A
and non-S/A subject markers are present on a constituent that is in constrative focus. To
express meanings such as ‘it wasn’t the man we met, it was the spirit’ speakers say ‘we didn’t
meet THE MAN; we met THE SPIRIT’, as in (10.4) below (cf. jɨko=dɨ (dog=S/A.TOP) ‘dog’
in example (6.10) in §6.2.1.1):

(10.5) is an example of the nominalized clausal constituent ‘one who doesn’t talk’. Cases of

know-NEG-LK-1sgIn Murui, questions differ from declarative and imperative clauses in both their intonation as
well as structure (see §11.2). The structure of some type of questions is unusual in that
predicate markers can be omitted for 3rd person singular, dual, and plural. Negative questions
with omitted predicate markers have different readings than their positive counterparts (see
§10.2.2). Murui has a single negative imperative (prohibitive) form, the standard negative
marker -ñe followed by the marker -no (see §10.2.3). Many of grammatical categories
available in positive clauses are available in the negative as well but there is some minor
degree of paradigmatic asymmetry between positive and negative imperatives. For instance,
the grammatical category of rapid action (used for immediate imperative meanings) cannot be
expressed in negative imperative. The language has two ‘privative’ markers -nino on nouns,
and -nino and -ñeno on verbs and adjectives (on verbs, -ñeno has prohibitive meanings, see
§10.2.3).
Murui lacks an independent grammatical word ‘no’; negative answers are expressed
by jɨɨ ‘yes, no’ followed by negated predicates instead (§10.3.1). 272 Murui has a number of
question words which can function as indefinites, such as ‘nobody/somebody’ and
‘nothing/something’. Their positive and negative readings depend on the predicate’s polarity
(see also jaka in (10.3) that can mean ‘always’ or ‘never’). The language doesn’t seem to
have inherently negative words. A few positive words however, such as mare ‘good,272Jɨɨ ‘agrees’ with predicate’s polarity and, depending on the context, can be translated as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[454, 455, 456, 457]"
"4.2.2.1 Physical property classifiers
In agreement with typology of semantic features recurrent in classifier system outlined in
Aikhenvald (2000: 272-274) and Aikhenvald (2017b), physical property classifiers
characterize referents for their shape and size, dimensionality, form, consistency,
interioricity, functional properties, and other physical property-related meanings. The
semantics of Murui physical property classifiers are given in Diagram 4.2.

Some physical property classifiers can be homonymous in that they have the same form but
different semantics, e.g. the classifier -bɨ means either a ‘form of a thick tuber’, as in maikabɨ ‘stem of sweet yucca maika-jɨ’, or a ‘thick substance’, as in jaɨga-bɨ (cahuana.drinkCLF:SUBS) ‘cahuana (drink)’. Some classifiers are also semantically related and arepolysemous, e.g. the classifier -ko stands for round things, as in nofɨ-ko (stoneCLF:SPHERICAL) ‘rock’, but can also have a meaning of a ‘cover’ and ‘container’, as in juye-ko (totumo.fruit-CLF:COVER) ‘pot (bowl made out of totumo fruit or gourd)’, and taaɨ-ko
(empty-CLF:COVER) ‘empty house’. 142 Semantics of a few classifiers seem to go beyond this.
Murui classifiers seem to have a certain amount of semantic abstraction related to their
physical properties. For instance, the classifier -jɨ for ‘cassava’ (in the Diagram 4.1 under
‘specific’) could be in fact subsumed under -jɨ ‘tube-shape’. 143
On morphological grounds, physical property classifiers can be divided according to
their forms, and can be either mono or disyllabic. While semantics of monosyllabic forms are
more general in nature, the meanings of disyllabic forms are more specific. In many cases,
the meanings of disyllabic classifiers are not compositional. There are more than 50
monosyllabic classifiers in Murui; the number of di-syllabic classifiers is estimated at 45-50.
Murui classifiers are listed in Tables 4.2-3. Cf. Diagram 4.2.
(The organization of the tables is as follows:
i) classifiers have been divided into semantic fields,
ii) fields are referred to with letters in alphabetical order across two tables;
iii) missing fields indicate that a certain semantic field does not occur for that classifier type.)142The meanings ‘cover’and ‘container’ may be related.","[214, 215]"

B. BENEFACTIVE ‘FOR, FOR BENEFIT OF’ WITH PRONOUNS – in their benefactive meaning, -ri
implies that the referent of the noun receives the benefit of the situation expressed by the
clause. The causal and benefactive meanings are related - benefactive readings do also
involve causal relationship. This is illustrated in (6.158). Such examples are rare in Murui,
however - while some speakers do use -ri with pronouns, others do not. Murui speakers
assign such usage to the Mɨnɨka variety, and frequently give benefactive reading in clauses
that contain with fakai ‘time’, as in (6.159).

While the use of -ri with 1st person singular is debatable among speakers, -ri with 1st person
plural, as in (6.160), is widely recognized. 208 What is interesting about (6.160) is that the
clause might have two different interpretations, each depending on a situation. If a speaker
utters it when the referent is present (e.g. during a gathering), it has positive connotations and
is understood as ‘(He) speaks for (the benefit of) us.’. If the referent is not present, the
meaning is negative, as in (6.160):
(6.160) kaɨ-ri

‘(He) speaks for (benefit of) us.’ or ‘(He) speaks (to cause misfortune) for us.’6.2.2.5 Privative
Murui nouns and ‘headless’ nominal modifiers can take the case marker -(ni)no meaning
‘without’. The marker -(ni)no is in fact a combination of the negative attributive -ni followed
by the privative -no. Such privative clauses always share the same subject. Examples are
given in (6.161-163):

The marker can also occur on verbs and adjectives in the form of -(ni)no or -(ñe)no (cf. the
form of the standard negator is -ñe). 209 The privative -no has to co-occur with either the
negative attributive -ni, as in examples (6.161-163) above, or the standard negator -ñe, as in

predicate: SV and AOV. Murui shows a nominative-accusative pattern of constituent
ordering – S, A followed by O, occur before the verb. The placement of the non-core
arguments follows the nominative–accusative nature of Murui: SXV and AOXV. Oblique
arguments are obligatorily marked with cases (see §6.2.2.1 on the occasional omission of the
locative). (6.165) illustrates an intransitive clause with the oblique argument San Rafaelmo
‘to San Rafael’ following the S argument. (6.166) is an example of a transitive clause with
the O following the A.

This chapter covers the grammatical expression of non-spatial setting and spatial setting in
Murui. The structure of a Murui predicate is discussed in §7.1. This is followed by the
description of Murui non-spatial setting in §7.2: the grammatical categories which express
the timing of activity (see §7.2.1 on tense), the internal composition of activity (aspect,
§7.2.2), speaker’s attitudes towards the event (modality, §7.2.3), as well as those categories
which provide information about the source of acquired knowledge (evidentiality and
epistemic modality, §7.2.4). Spatial setting (i.e. direction and location expressed with affixes
on verb), the andative and ventive, are discussed in §7.3. The last section §7.4 offers a brief
summary.","[340, 341, 342]"

D2. FULLY INFLECTED VERBS CAST IN FUTURE TENSE – fully inflected verbs cast in future have
stern and personal suggestions and command-like meanings. In (11.31), a woman was giving
an order to her daughter to stay home and watch other children while she would go away. Her
utterances are casted in the future tense:

E. VERBAL ROOTS FOLLOWED BY EVENT NOMINALIZERS – there are two types of nominalized
constructions with command-like meanings: those followed by the future event nominalizer
-ye, and those followed by the future nominalizer and the emphatic marker -za.
E1. VERBAL ROOT FOLLOWED BY THE FUTURE EVENT NOMINALIZER -ye – those types of
constructions are typically used as strong, impersonal, and indirect commands (see §3.1.4 on
Murui nominalization types). Event nominalizations take no pronominal subject markers and,
therefore, have impersonal readings.

Lexical adverbial demonstratives, such as akɨ ‘auditory’, can have dɨne cliticized to them, as
in arɨ=bene (uphill=HERE.LOC:NSP) for ‘uphill here’ (cf. §3.3.3). Unlike the classifier-like -no
in (4.87) above, -ne cannot be used as in the nominalizer function on verbs, but unlike
-no, it can function as a ‘linker’ that can be followed by classifiers. This is illustrated in
(4.93) below (which, synchronically, is a lexicalized noun anane-ko (maloca-CLF:COVER) (see
e.g. example (5.12) in §5.1.1.1):
(4.93) ana-ne-ko
below-LOC:NSP-CLF:COVER
‘maloca (lit. from below (i.e. sky) place that is covered, like a house)’
C. LOCATION CLASSIFIER-LIKE MARKER -fe ‘AT THE SIDE OF’ ‒ the morpheme -fe has the
meaning of ‘location at the side of’. It occurs only on adverbs and lexical adverbial
demonstratives, such as baaɨfe ‘over there’ (cf. baaɨ ‘there (far from speaker)’ in §3.3.3) and
can have a function of a ‘linker’ followed by physical property classifiers. Forms that take -fe
have noun-like features: they can occur with non-core case markers they can occur with a
modifier in an NP, and they function as non-core arguments in the prototypical nominal slots
in the clause. In the following examples the place adverbs of place aa ‘above’ and arɨ ‘uphill’
take the location classifier-like marker -fe ‘at the side of’, further followed by the locative
marker -mo:
(4.94) aa-fe-moLOC

Place adverbs which take -fe can serve as a base for further derivations with classifiers, where
the morpheme -fe ‘acts’ as a linker for other classifiers that specify a referent to their physical
properties, as in (4.96-97):
(4.96) aa-fe-beji

‘I am going (away) to fish in this pit (that is located below the hill).’4.4Classifier stackingIn terms of ordering of classifiers in multiclassifier words, there appear to be different
classifier sets that can be rearranged according to their semantics; some behave as ‘linkers’
between roots and classifiers. With regards to classifier stacking, physical property classifiers
can be combined. Such constructions can have up to three classifier positions (the third
position is occupied by a classifier in a ‘linker’ function, such as -ra discussed in §4.2.2.5, or
-fe discussed in §4.3.2). Examples are given in (4.98-99):
(4.98) kue-ra-be-niko
write-CLF:NEUT-CLF:LEAF-CLF:PLAIN.THIN
‘notebook, specific, long in shape’
(4.99) da-fe-be-kuiro
one-CLF:SIDE-CLF:LEAF-CLF:PEEL
‘five (lit. one side of peel of leaf)’
Within a syntactic phrase, classifiers can occur in two ways: either following a noun, as
shown in (4.100), or following a noun and a ‘headless’ nominal modifier in the possessive
construction with the same meaning, as in (4.101). Pragmatic difference between these two
examples is unclear, usually speakers say that these are ‘shortened’ equivalents. Possibly this
is the ‘origin’ of classifier stacking structures:228

‘liquid of the chambira fruit’
(4.101) [ñekɨ-kɨ
i-ji]NP
chambira-CLF:ROUND ANA.NSP-CLF:WATERY
‘liquid of the chambira fruit’
In terms of ordering of classifiers in multiclassifier words, there appear to be different
classifier sets that can be interchangeably rearranged according to their semantics. Such
rearragnements are not frequent, however. In (4.102) classifiers -ko for ‘cover’ and -be for
‘leaf-like forms’ occur in various positions resulting in meaning change. It has to be noted,
however, that it is uncommon for classifiers to occur in either order in Murui.
(4.102) a. yera-kobe
liquid.tobacco-CLF:ROUND.LEAF
‘leaf containing yera (liquid tobacco paste)’
b. yera-be-ko
liquid.tobacco-CLF:LEAF-CLF:COVER
‘container to wrap yera in’4.5Functions of classifiers and repeatersClassifiers and repeaters, as noun categorization devices in Murui, have various functions;
see, among others, Aikhenvald (2000: 316-333). Some, although similar, are not quite the
same. This section discusses functions of classifiers and repeaters in Murui in greater detail.","[250, 251, 252, 253]"

1.3.4Marriage customs and kinship terminologyTraditionally, the ‘Witoto’ were required to adhere to a number of rules when considering
marriage. Wives joined from other affiliated clans by the rule of exogamy. When a man
married a woman, the relatives of each of the spouses would become relatives of their
descendants. This was the way of making diverse alliances among various clans (Echeverri,
1997: 80). The ‘Witoto’ peoples practised polygamy, where the man would frequently marry
his wife’s sister (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 75). 32 Although a difference in age between
partners wishing to marry was not officially disallowed, it was much more common for a
couple to be relatively similar in age. Elders strictly forbade marriage when a couple had any
direct traceable kin relations on either the father’s or mother’s side. Marrying cross and
parallel cousins was generally considered taboo (E. Minor & Minor, 1980: 80). 33 In order for
a marriage to be recognized, a couple attended a ritual, after which they could take up
residency together (Gasché, 2009c: 13). The ‘Witoto’ people did not practice formal divorce
rituals. If one of the members in a marriage wished to divorce the other, they must present a
sufficient reason for it (e.g. bad temper, disease, childlessness, negligence of the spouse)
(Whiffen, 1915: 165).
Legitimate children always belonged to their father’s line, never to the mother’s line.
The obligations of a child’s parents depended (and generally still do) on its sex. In the old
days, as well as today, the mother was compelled to care for the infant, either male or female.","[57, 58]"
