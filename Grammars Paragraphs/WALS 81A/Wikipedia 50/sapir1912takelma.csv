"All of these are absent fromTakelma, which, in turn, has a complete labial series '(b, p‘, p!, m),whereas Chasta Costa has only the nasal m (labial stops occur apparently only in borrowed words, bé¢i’ cat <pussy). The fortis k!,common in Takelma, seems in the Chasta Costa to be replaced by g/; the
Takelma vowel ii, found also in California, is absent from ChastaCosta; 7 is foreign to either, though found in Galice Creek and Shasta.
Perhaps the greatest point of phonetic difference, however, between
the Takelma and Chasta Costa languages lies in the peculiar long
(doubled) consonants of the latter, while Takelma regularly simpli-fies consonant geminations that would theoretically appear in the
building of words. Not enough of the Shasta has been published to
enable one to form an estimate of the degree of phonetic similaritythat obtains between it and Takelma, but the differences can hardly
be as pronounced as those that have just been found to exist in the
case of the latter and Chasta Costa.
This preliminary survey seemed necessary in order to show, as faras the scanty means at present at our disposal would allow, the
ponetic affiliations of Takelma. Attention will now be directed to
the sounds themselves.

"ETHNOLOGYElementsGENERAL[BULL.40(§§ 97-102)REMARKSUnder the head of post-nominal elements are included a small
group of suffixes which, though altogether without the distinct individuality characteristic of local postpositions, are appended to the
fully formednoun, pronoun, or adjective, in some cases also adverb,serving in one way or another to limit or extend the range of application of one of these denominating or qualifying terms. The line
of demarcation between these post-nominal elements and the more
freely movable modalparticles discussed below(§ 114) is not veryeasy to draw; the most convenient criterion of classification is the
inability of what we have termed PosT-NOMINAL elements to attach
themselves to verb-forms.
§ 98. EXCLUSIVE-t‘aThe suffix -f‘a is freely appended to nouns and adjectives, less frequently to pronouns, in order to specify which one out of a numberis meant; the implication is always that the particular person, object,

‘Takelma and languages that have been dignified by the name “ inflectional.’”’ It is generally said, in defining inflection, that languages
of the inflectional as contrasted with those of the agglutinative typemake use of words of indivisible psychic value, in which the stem and
the various grammatical elements have entirely lost their single individualities, but have “chemically”(!) coalesced into a single form-unit; in other words, the word is not a mere mosaic of phonetic
materials, of which each is the necessary symbol of some special

TRANSITIVES,CLASSIII (§§ 62-66)§ 62. General RemarksThe subject pronominal elements of the transitive verb combine
with the objective elements to form rather closely welded compound
endings, yet hardly ever so that the two can not separately be recognized as such; the order of composition is in every case pronominal
object + subject. It is only in the combinations THov or YE
ve that such composition does not take place; in these the first person
singular object is, properly speaking, not expressed at all, except in
so far as the stem undergoes palatalization if possible (see § 31, 1),
while the second person subject assumes the form in which it is
found in Class II of intransitive verbs. The pronominal objects are
decidedly a more integral part of the verb-form than the subjects,
for not only do they precede these, but in passives, periphrastic
futures, nouns of agency, and infinitives they are found unaccompanied by them. For example:
dimaxbina® you will be killed (178.15)dimabigulu‘k’” he will kill you
démzbi‘s one who kills you
déimaxbiya to kill you
are analogous, as far as the incorporated pronominal object (-b7-) is
concerned, to:
dimaxbink* he will kill you; tlomdxbitn I kill youThe pronominal objects are found in all the tense-modes, as far as
the meaning of these permits, and are entirely distinct from all the
subjective elements, exceptthat the endingof the secondpersonplural coincides with one form of the second person singular present
imperative of the intransitive, -anp‘.","[171, 172, 173]"
"Inno case is the plural suffix necessary in order to give a word its full
syntactic form; it is always appended to the absolute noun or to the
noun with its full complement of characteristic and pronominal affix.
The simple form -(a)n of the suffix appears only in the third personal reflexive possessive -gwa-n (see § 91) and, apparently, the third
personal possessive -t‘an of pre-positive local phrases (see p. 238).
Many absolute nouns ending in a vowel, or in 1, m, or n, also nouns
with personal affixes (including pre-positives with possessive suffixes)
other than that of the third person, take the form -han of the plural§ 99Se248BUREAUOF AMERICANETHNOLOGY(Bute.40suffix; the -h- may be a phonetically conditioned rather than morphologically significant element. - Examples are:

been explained as composed of the third personal suffix -¢‘ and the
pluralizing element -han: no’ts!a*t‘an HIS NEIGHBORS.
In some cases,as in wa-wi''t'an GIRLS 55.16; 106.17, -t‘an may be explained as
composed of the exclusive -t‘a discussed above and the plural -n.
The fact, however, that -t‘an may itself be appended both to this
exclusive -¢‘a and to the full third personal form of nouns not pro
vided with a pre-positive makes it evident that the -t'a- of the plural
suffix -t‘an is an element distinct from either the exclusive -f‘a or
third personal -¢'.

"CONCLUSIONThe salient morphologic characteristics of Takelma may be summed
up in the wordsINFLECTIVEandINCORPORATING,the chief stressbeing laid on either epithet according as one attaches greater importance to the general method employed in the formation of words and
forms and their resulting inner coherence and unity, or to the particular grammatical treatment of a special, though for many Ameri-can languages important, syntactic relation, the object. Outside of
most prefixed elements and a small number of the post-nominal
suffixes, neither of which enter organically into the inner structure
of the word-form, the Takelma word is a firmly knit morphologic
unit built up of a radical base or stem and one or more affixed (generally suffixed) elements of almost entirely formal, not material,
signification.",[287]

thus found to be a firm phonetic and psychic unit, and to be characterized by some of the supposed earmarks of inflection, what is left
but to frankly call the language “inflectional”? ‘‘Polysynthetic’”’ and
‘“‘incorporative” are not in the slightest degree terms that exclude
such a designation, for they have reference rather to the detailed
treatment of certain groups of concepts than to morphologic method.
Everything depends on the point of view. If chief stress for purposes
of classification is laid on the relative importance and fulness of the
verb, Takelma is polysynthetic; if the criterion of classification be
taken to be whether the verb takes the pronominal object within its
structure or not, it is incorporating; if, finally, stress be laid on the
general method of building up the word from smaller elements, it is
inflective. Not that Takelma is in the least thereby relegated to a
peculiar or in any way exceptional position. A more objective, unhampered study of languages spoken in various parts of the world
will undoubtedly reveal a far wider prevalence than has been generally admitted of the inflectional type.",[60]

INTRANSITIVESUFFIXES(§§52-57)§ 52. General RemarksUnder this head are included such suffixes as intransitivize a transi-ive verb by removing the object (-va-), transferring the object from
rithout to within the sphere of the subject (reflexive, reciprocal), orhanging the character of the action altogether (non-agentive, posiional). The passive intransitivizes by removing, not the object, but
he subject, the former remaining in exactly the same form in whichve find it in the corresponding transitive; the voice is characterized

‘he normal transitive, its ancillary passive, the active intransitive
-ca-), the reflexive, the reciprocal, the non-agentive, and the posi-ional may be looked upon as the seven voices of a transitive verb, of
vhich only the first five (possibly also the sixth), however, can be
reely formed from any transitive stem.
Of the seven voices, theifst two are provided with a distinct set of pronominal object (and
Tansitive subject) suffixes; the third

"In some respects Takelma is typically American, in so far as it is
possible at all to speak of typical American linguistic characteristics.
Some of the more important of these typical or at any rate widespread American traits, that are found in Takelma, are: the incorporation of the pronominal (and nominal) object in the verb; the
incorporation of the possessive pronouns in the noun; the closerassociation with the verb-form of the object than the subject; dl
inclusion of a considerable number of instrumental and local m
cations in the verb-complex; the weak development of differences
tense in the verb and of number in the verb and noun; and t
impossibility of drawing a sharp line between mode and tense.
§ 116poss]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA283Of the more special grammatical characteristics, some of which are
nearly unparalleled in those languages of North America that have
been adequately studied, are: a system of pitch-accent of fairly considerable, though probably etymologically secondary, formal significance; a strong tendency in the verb, noun, adjective, and adverb
toward the formation of dissyllabic stems with repeated vowel (e. g.,
aorist stem yowo- BE; verb-stem loho- DIE; noun mozo‘ BUZZARD;
adjective hos-d"" [plural] GzTTIna Bia; adverb olo‘m FORMERLY); &very considerable use of end reduplication, initial reduplication being
entirely absent; the employment of consonant and vowel changes as a
grammatical process; the use in verbs, nouns, and adjectives of pre-fixed elements, identical with body-part noun stems, that have reference now to parts of the body, now to purely local relations; the
complicated and often irregular modifications of a verbal base for
the formation of the most generalized tense, the aorist; the great
differentiation of pronominal schemes according to syntactic rela-tion, class of verb or noun, and tense-mode, despite the comparatively
small numberof persons(only five—two singular, two plural, andone indifferent); the entire lack in the noun and pronoun of cases
(the subjective and objective are made unnecessary by the pronominal
and nominal incorporation characteristic of the verb; the possessive,
by the formal use of possessive pronoun affixes; and the local cases,by the extended use of pre-positives and postpositions) ; the existence
in the noun of characteristic suffixes that appear only with prepositives and possessive affixes; the fair amount of distinctness that
the adjective possesses as contrasted with both verb and noun; the
use of a decimal system of numeration, tertiary or quinary in origin;and arather efficient though simple syntactic apparatus of subordinating elements and well-modulated enclitic particles. Altogether
Takelma has a great deal that is distinct and apparently even isolated
about it. Though typical in its most fundamental features, it may,
when more is known of American languages as a whole, have to
be considered a very specialized type.","[288, 289]"
"§ 51as]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA149wdly be insisted upon; much depends on idiomatic usage. The
direct reflexive suffix, it would seem, is employed only when the
rect object is incorporated in the verb; if the direct object is takenit of the verb-complex and provided with a possessive pronoun, all
nbiguity as to the relation between subject and object is removed
id the -gwa- falls out. Thus we have da°%-de‘le’p‘gwa HE PIERCED

". They expresspronominal elements for subject and object in the verb, for the possessor in the noun, modal elements in the verb. Thus a word like
tlomézinik’ WE KILL ONE ANOTHER contains, besides the aorist stemtlomé- (formed from dé“m-), the suffixed elements -z- (expressing
general idea of relation between subject and object), -in- umlauted
from -an- (element denoting reciprocal action [-2-in-=EACH OTHER,ONE ANOTHER]), and -ik‘ (first personal plural subject intransitive
aorist). As an example of suffixation in the noun may be given
tlibagwa‘n-t'k‘ my PancrEAS.
This form contains, besides the stem
iliba-, the suffixed elements -gw- (of no ascertainable concrete significance, but employed to form several body-part nouns; e. g., ¢/iba‘k‘”PANOREAS 47.17), -an- (apparently meaningless in itself and appearing suffixed to many nouns when they are provided with possessive
endings), and -¢‘k‘ (first personal singular possessive).
§ 29. Infixation
Infixation, or what superficially appears to be such, is found onlyin the formation of certain aorist stems and frequentatives.

yonoina’*n I always sing (aorist stem yonon-)
ts/ayatk‘ he used to shoot them (cf. ts/aya‘k* he shot them)On examination it is found that the infixed element is invariably
a repetition of part of the phonetic material given by the stem.
Thus the infixed -a- and -i- of mats!ag- and wits:!im- are repetitions
of the -a- and -i- of the stems masg- and wism-; the infixed -i- of
yonoin- and ts/ayaig- are similarly repetitions of the y- of yonon
and -y- of ts!ayag-.","[62, 63]"
"Not only morphologically, but also syntactically, are passives
‘losely related to transitive forms. It is the logical unexpressed subect of a passive sentence, not the grammatical subject (logical and
ormal object), that is referred to by the reflexive possessive in -gwa
‘see §§ 91,92).
Thus:
dik!olola’n t‘ga'*p'dagwan

his-own-horns) with (in other words, they dug him up with
their own horns) 48.5

delong partly to Class I or Class II intransitives, partly to the transitives. These may be conveniently grouped together as Class IV, but

particles in the same order in which they have been listed. Inasmuch
as the exact function of a prefix is to a considerable extent determined
by its position, it follows that the same prefix, phonetically speaking,
may appear with slightly variant meanings according as it is to be
interpreted as an object, local element, or instrument.
Thus theprefix 7- always has reference to the hand or to both hands; but the
exact nature of the reference depends partly on the form of the verb
and partly on the position of the prefix itself, so that 7- may be translated, according to the circumstances of the case, asHAND(s):
i-pli'-no'""k'watn I warm my hands
WITH THE HAND:
7-£0""dini''n I hunt for it with the hand (= I am feeling aroundfor it)
IN THE HAND:
p'im-i-ho""gwagwa’'n I run with salmon in my handIn the first of these three examples the 7- as object precedes the
incorporated instrumental p/i FIRE, so that the form means literally
I WARM MY HANDS WITH FIRE. In the third form the 7 as local ele
ment follows the incorporated object p‘tm saLMon. Such a triplicete
use is found only in the case of incorporated nouns, particularly such
as refer to parts of the body. These incorporated elements are to
be kept distinct from certain other elements that are used in aD
§ 34B0A8]HANDBOOKOF INDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA65adverbial sense only, and regularly occupy the second position.
The line between these two sets of prefixes is, however, difficult to
draw when it comes to considering the place to be assigned to some
of the prefixed elements. It is doubtful whether we are fully justified
in making absolutely strict distinctions between the various uses ofthe body-part prefixes; at any rate, it is certainly preferable, from a
native point of view, to translate the three examples of i- incorporation given above as:
I-hand-fire-warm(-as-regards-myself)T-hand-hunt-for-it
T-salmon-hand-run-with
leaving in each case the exact delimitation in meaning of the element
HAND to be gathered from the general nature of the form. The following examples will render the matter of position and function of the
various prefixes somewhat clearer:

"In support of the actual existence of this admired lack of a oneto-one correspondence between a grammatical category and its phonetic expression is often quoted the multiplicity of elements that
serve to symbolize the same concept; e. g., Lat. -i, -ae, -a, -és, -iis, all
indicate that the idea of a plurality of subjects is to be associated
with the concrete idea given by the main body of the words towhich they are attached. Furthermore, variability of the stem or
base itself is frequently adduced as a proof of its lack of even a
relative degree of individuality apart from the forms from which
by analysis it has been abstracted; e. g., German bind-, band-, bund-,bdnd-, biind-. These two characteristics are very far indeed from
constituting anything like a definition of inflection, but they are
often referred to as peculiar to it, and hence may well serve us as
approximate tests.
.
As regards the first test, we find that just such a multiplicity of
phonetic symbols for the same, or approximately the same, concept,
is characteristic of Takelma. The idea of possession of an object by
@ person or thing other than the speaker or person addressed is
expressed by -2a, -a, -da (-t‘a), +t’, or +, all of which are best rendered
by HIs, HER, ITS, THEIR (the ideas of gender and number do not
here enter as requiring grammatical expression).
Similarly, the ideaof the person speaking as subject of the action or state predicated
by the main body of the verb is expressed by the various elements
te’ (de®), -t'e* (-de*), -'n, -n, -k‘a® (-ga*), all of which are best ren-dered in English by “I.”-¢'ef is confined to the aorist of intransi-tive verbs; -t‘e* is future intransitive; -'n is aorist transitive; -n is
future transitive; and -k‘a‘ is used in all inferential forms, whethertransitive or intransitive.",[59]
"When used with adjectives -t‘a hassometimes the appearance of forming the comparative or superlative;
e. g., aga (1) tlos:6’""¢'a (2) THIS (1) I8 SMALLER (2), but such an interpretation hardly hits the truth of the matter. The sentence just
quoted really signifies THIs Is SMALL (NOT LARGE LIKE THAT). Asa
matter of fact, -t‘a is rather idiomatic in its use, and not susceptible
of adequate translation into English, the closest rendering being
generally a dwelling of the voice on the corresponding English word,

§ 99. PLURAL(-f<an, -han, -k/an)As a rule, it is not considered necessary in Takelma to specify the
singularity or plurality of an object, the context generally serving to
remove the resulting ambiguity.
In this respect Takelma resemblesmany other American languages. The element -(a)n, however, is
aot infrequently employed to form a plural, but this plural is of
rather indefinite application when the noun is supplied with a third
personal possessive suffix (compareregard to -gwan).what was said above,§ 91, inThe fact that the plurality implied by the suffixmay have reference to either the object possessed or to the possessoror to both (e. g., beya’nhan HIS DAUGHTERSor THEIR DAUGHTER,THEIR DAUGHTERS) makes it very probable that we are here dealing,not with the simple idea of plurality, but rather with that of reciprocity. It is probably not accidental that the plural -(a)n agrees
phonetically with the reciprocal element -an- found in the verb.","[252, 253]"
"As in many Indian languages, the stress-accent of anyparticular word in Takelma is not so inseparably associated with any
particular syllable but that the same word, especially if consisting
of more than two syllables, may appear with the main stress-accent
now on one, now on the other syllable. In the uninterrupted flow of
the sentence it becomes often difficult to decide which syllable of a
word should be assigned the stress-accent. Often, if the word bears
no particular logical or rhythmic emphasis, one does best to regard
it as entirely without accent and as standing in a proclitic or enclitic
relation to a following or preceding word of greater emphasis. This
is naturally chiefly the case with adverbs (such as he‘ne THEN) andconjunctive particles (such as ganéhi® AND THEN; agas‘i§ AND SO, BUT
THEN); though it not infrequently happens that the major part of
a clause will thus be strung along without decided stress-accent until
some emphatic noun or verb-form is reached. Thus the following
passage occurs in one of the myths:
ganéhit dewenza 1a°lé hono® p‘ele’za‘, literally translated, And
then to-morrow (next day) it became, again they went out towar
All that precedes the main verb-form p‘ele’za' THEY WENT OUT TO
wk is relatively unimportant, and hence is hurried over without anywhere receiving marked stress.
Nevertheless a fully accented word is normally stressed on some
particular syllable; it may even happen that two forms differ
merely in the place of accent:
naga’~ida* when he said, but
naga-da’* when you said
_ The important point to observe, however, is that when a particular
syllable does receive the stress (and after all most words are normally
§ 516BUREAUOF AMERICANETHNOLOGY(BULL.40accented on some one syllable), it takes on one of two or three musicalinflections:

naga’*n I said to him(second -a- part of stem)72.9, but na%gi’ nI shall say to him; n@*gi’*k‘ say to him! (future) 196.20; nak‘ik'he said to him (inferential) 94.16; 170.9; 172.12
The general significance of -i- seems not unlike that of the prefixedlirective al-, though the application of the former element is very
auch wider; i. e., it refers to action directed toward some person or
bject distinctly outside the sphere of the subject. Hence the -i- is
ever found used together with the indirect reflexive -k‘wa-, even
hough this suffix is accompanied by an instrumental prefix:
2°-p!t*-no'""k'watn I warm my own back (188.20)na few cases the applicability of the action of the verb can be
hifted from the sphere of the subject to that of another person or
hing by a mere change of the connective -a- to -i-, without the
idded use of prefix or suffix:
2a*-la’*t!an I shall put it about my waist, but 2a%-la’*t/in I shall
put it about his waistIn the form of the third personal subject with third personal object
f the aorist, the imperative with third personal object, and the
nferential with third personal object, the -i- generally appears as a
uffixed -hi- (-‘i-), incapable of causing umlaut:
malagana’nhi he told him 30.15, but malagini’¢n I told him (172.1)wa-tlomémhi he killed him with it§ 64'174BUREAUOFAMERICANETHNOLOGYondt-kli*manana’nhi he fixed it for him
-klimana’nhi fix it for him!
i-klimana’nhik' he fixed it for him (infer.), but 7-k!imaninini'nk'
he will fix it for him
It should be noted, however, that many verbs with characteristic
-i- either may or regularly do leave out the final -‘7:alzi’*k' he saw him 124.6, 8 (cf. al-ai’‘gitn I saw him, 188.11)!","[179, 180]"
"3048]HANDBOOKOFINDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA61within the first six groups is to list them as miscellaneous cases.
Such are:
gwel-letsdet I shall be lame (cf. gwel-la’is klemna’n I shall make
him lame
le*psi‘ wing (if derived, as seems probable, from stem lé*b- carry)tlemeya’nwia“ peoplego along to see her married 178.1(cf.tamayana’'n I take her somewheres to get her married [148.5])
Palatal ablaut, it should be noted, does not affect the -a- of the
second member of reduplicated verbs:
t‘galt‘ga'l it bounced from her 140.8t‘geltg‘a’/Isi it bounced from me
The connecting vowel, however, of verbs reduplicated according to
the third type always follows the stem-vowel:
dak‘da-hele’ halzade§ I am accustomed to answer (stem -2a@4I-)It is difficult to find a very tangible psychic connection between the
various cases that require the use of the palatal ablaut, nor is there
the slightest indication that a phonetic cause lies at the bottom of
the phenomenon.
If we disregard the first group of cases, we shall
find that they have this in common, they are all or nearly all intransi-tives derived from transitives by means of certain voice-forming elements (-z-, -xa-, -gwi-, -k‘wa-), or else nominal passives or derivatives
of such intransitives (-ak'”, -<-ap'); -k‘wa-, it is true, takes transi-tive pronominal forms; but it is logically intransitive in character
in that it indicates action in reference to something belonging to the
subject. The only trait that can be found in common to the first
group and the remaining is that the action may be looked upon as:
self-centered; just as, e. g., a form in -za- denotes that the (logically)
transitive action is not conceived of as directed toward some definite
outside object, but is held within the sphere of the person of central
interest (the subject), so, also, in a form with incorporated first person singular object, the action may be readily conceived of as taking
place within the sphere of the person of central interest from the
point of view of the speaker. No difficulty will be found in making
this interpretation fit the other cases, though it is not conversely true
that all forms implying self-centered action undergo palatalization.","[66, 67]"

"Loose prefixation isextremely common, nominal objects, instruments, and local ideas of

we have seen, in thismanner.
Examples of such loose prefixation are:
gwen-‘a'l-yowo! he looked back (gwen- in back; al- is difficult todefine, but can perhaps be best described as indicative of action
away from one’s self, here with clear implication of sight directed
outward; yowo’' he was, can be used as independent word)

"§ 563048]HANDBOOKOF INDIANLANGUAGES—TAKELMA155the subject is not thought of as being the direct cause of the state oractivity predicated, but is rather considered as indirectly responsible
for it. Thus, from the aorist stem t‘gwilik!w- (t‘gwili’*-2 WATER,
BLOOD DROPS, DRIPS 58.1) are formed:pla-i-t'‘guili’k!wana‘n I (voluntarily) drop, spill it
pla-i-t'gwili’*xna‘n T have it drop (unavoidably), spill it (72.8,16)
§ 57. Positional-i/-As we have already seen (§ 40, 15), this suffix, though of clearly
derivational character, is generally, probably always, confined to theaorist. A positional verb in -i/- may be defined as expressing the
state or condition resulting from the completed action of a transitive
or non-agentive; e. g., p/a-t-ha-u-t'‘gup!idt IT (BOX-LIKE OBJECT) LIES
UPSIDE DOWN is a verb expressing the result of the action defined inpla-i-ha-u-t' gii/""ba‘n I UPSET IT and p/a-i-ha-u-t'gii'“pz IT UPSET 60.8.
From one point of view the suffix -7'- serves to mark off a class of purely
positional verbs, a different verb-stem being used for each general
form-category of the object described. Such verbs of position are:
dinkli long, stretched out object lies (transitive aorist dinik!-)
t‘geits'!i round object lies (138.24) (¢‘geyets:!-)p'udi flat object lies’
tlobigi corpse, dead-looking body lies

da-sgali scattered objects (like grain on floor) liewik lidi several objects heaped together lie (wi‘g-)
s‘asini erect object is, he stands 34.1; 45.12; 77.9su'wili sitting object (person) is, he sits, dwells 21.1; 57.2
k‘ebili absent object is, he is long absent 124.20
Not so clearly positional are:
la*li (generally heard as la*lé‘) it becomes 33.17; 45.3
yamli he looks pretty
Of these verbs those that are directly derived from transitives, it
will be observed, use in the aorist the verb-stem, not the aorist stem,
of their simplex (thus dink!-, not dinik!-). The derivational -(a)d(see § 42, 4) that seems to characterize a number of positional verbscan not be explained.","[160, 161]"
