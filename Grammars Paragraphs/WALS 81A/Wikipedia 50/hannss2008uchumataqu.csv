"(Vellard 1967:19)From a morphological point of view, the criteria for calling example (37) a
compound are fulfilled. That is, both components immediately follow each other
without intermediate constituents and inflection occurs on the final member of the
construction. However, structures such as example (37) are not lexicalised and they
express two clearly separable actions ('want' and 'know') and are thus
compositional. Therefore, semantics prohibit an interpretation of sisa pekucay and
identical constructions as compounds. Instead, they are analysed as chain verb
constructions (cf. 5.7.3).
3.4.2 Noun incorporation
As Croft (2003:168) puts it, ""[n]oun incorporation is the phenomenon by which a
noun is so closely bound to a verb grammatically that it is considered to be part of
it."". Thus, noun incorporation can be viewed as a subcategory of compounding and is
therefore likewise a derivational process. Croft (2003:169) further points out that
direct objects are the nouns which are most likely to be incorporated, while Anderson
(1985:54) adds that subjects of intransitive verbs may also be incorporated.
The analysis of noun incorporation in Uchumataqu is affected by the same
source-related methodological restrictions as nominal compounding, but there are
two particular factors that contribute to an even higher degree of uncertainty. First,
Uchumataqu does not mark a direct object morphologically and thus, noun
incorporation cannot be attested by the non-application of a particular morphological
marker. Second, since the principal word order is SOV it is often not determinable
syntactically whether an item is an instance of noun incorporation or a simple
nominal phrase (subject or direct object) followed by a verb phrase, as in example
(38).

"(Vellard 1967:2)When adjectives in predicative function are modified by adverbs, we find three
different possibilities for word order. There is a strong tendency to place the subject
before the adjective:
-SUB
SUB
ADVADJ
ADV
SUBADV
ADJ
ADJThe position of the sentence's constituents probably depends on focus (marked with
-cay) and the speaker's intention, as the following examples demonstrate:
(135)(136)wata-kfij
aski-cay
iyai
village-TOP far-DEC
more
'The village is further away.'",[218]
"(Métraux 1935:105)Apart from these peculiarities, word order does not differ from the most common
types found in declarative clauses, i.e. SOV, SV, or OV. Since the interrogative
pronoun already marks the construction as not being declarative, no particular word
order is required. As with simple declarative clauses, deviations from these types
occur but represent only a minority within the group of information questions.
Particularly in Uhle's data (1894) do we find a frequent repetition of the subject
or subject pronoun. Whether this is an emphatic device or a peculiarity of
interrogative clauses remains uncertain.",[296]
"(Vellard 1951:35)The noun hep 'father' is the subject of example (79), whereas kuyla 'house' serves as
object. Thus, these findings are in accordance with Payne's definition. However, with
regard to the role of objects we find an overlap with verbs since verbs can likewise
function as arguments, i.e. objects. These cases will be further discussed in 3.6.3.
The third functional property of nouns mentioned by Payne is their potential to
be the topics of texts, as demonstrated in example (80a) and (80b). As such, they are
often marked by topic marker -ki (bold).
315
The proposal made by Payne is in accordance with Schachter (19853), who proposes a classification of
word classes in general on the basis of distributional and morphosyntactic features 1 would like to point
out that Payne uses the term ""distributional"" instead of 'functional', which is employed by me in order to
cover morphological peculiarities as well.

predicates and objects, they show some overlap with the class of verbs
As structural properties of nouns Payne (1997 35) lists the ""possibility of taking
descriptive modifiers [ ] and the use of genitive case pronouns"" With respect to the
first requirement, we find that verbs, too, can take descriptive modifiers in the form
of adverbs However, the range of modifiers that refer to nouns is broader than that
refenng to verbs That is, nouns can be modified by other nouns (82), by adjectives
(77), and numerals (83) Verbs can be modified only by adverbs that express manner
or degree

universal property of nouns. In Uchumataqu, however, this function sets nouns
clearly apart from the word classes of verbs and adjectives, which cannot be marked
for either. However, if the criterion of case marking is considered, we find that
adverbs of time, direction, and location can be marked for case as well, as in:
(88)sies-kfisjtani

"(Vellard 1967:9)According to Payne (1997:233), this construction may be a verb-verb compound
which he defines as follows: ""[...] both roots are recognizable verbs in their own
right, but nothing can come in between them, and the meaning of the whole structure
is 'bleached', i.e., slightly different from the combination of the lexical meanings of
the two roots [...]."" (marking by the author). Although the database on this
phenomenon is limited, the first two requirements can be regarded as fulfilled, i.e.
both roots are verbs in their own rights and their combination is not split up by other
components. With respect to the last requirement, we have to rely on the translations
656Métraux added in parentheses 'wiéi sus""1' Since the nature of this comment is uncertain, it is not dealt
with here
*"" Since 'to rest' is an intransitive verb, object marker -« may suggest a reflexive meaning here289CHAPTER 7 - CLAUSESoffered in the sources which do not suggest a change of meaning. Thus, within this
possible compound, the verb forms are not translated any different from a
complement-verb construction. Thus, constructions as in (91) stand somewhere in
between complements and verb-verb compounds and I view them as a subcategory of
the chain verb constructions.
Finally, I would like to add a note concerning the difference between
complements marked by action nominaliser -s(i) and chain verb constructions. Both
means show a certain similarity in that they are used for complementation and almost
always occur with pek- 'to want' as the matrix verb. Thus, the question of their
difference in meaning arises. Since the database is not extensive and for most cases,
we lack a context, the following has to be regarded as speculative. We may assume
that the missing marking of complement verbs in chain verb constructions conveys
the idea of a greater semantic integration into the matrix than is the case with -s(i)marked complements and it may be possible that zero marked verbs then denote a
permanent or long-standing wish or desire in contrast to complements inflected with
the action nominaliser. If this assumption is correct, then e.g. (84) could be
understood as a permanent refusal to drink, i.e. the person never drinks, while e.g.
(87) denotes a momentary wish. This hypothesis is further supported by the use of the
temporal adverb hase 'now' in (87).
7.8.3 Adverbial clauses
In what follows, I will discuss adverbial clauses, which ""modify a verb phrase or a
whole clause. [...] The kinds of information embodied in adverbial clauses are the
same kinds of information expressed by adverbs, [...]."" Payne (1997:316f). On this
basis, five types of adverbial clauses can be established for Uchumataqu:
Clause type
time
simultaneous
conditional
manner
purposeMarker
-na
-ku
-(t)xani
-ni
-xapaTable 7.1 : Adverbial clauses in UchumataquFollowing Thompson and Longacre (1985:172) I will discuss as typical devices of
adverbial subordinate clauses: ""(a) subordinating morphemes (b) special verb forms
(c) word order"".
The following statements are valid for all types of Uchumataqu adverbial
clauses. Both the matrix as well as the adverbial clause show an unmarked
declarative word order in principle, i.e. SOV (although rather exceptionally), SV, or
OV. This is possible since there is an overt marker signaling the adverbial function of
an expression inflected with any of the markers shown in table 7.1. The use of
The authors (1985 177) also divide adverbial clauses into those that can be substituted for by a single
word and those that cannot. This criterion is impossible to verify for Uchumataqu due to the condition of
the data. Thus, these two subgroups will not be part of the following discussion.","[305, 306]"
"(Vellard 1951:32)In some cases, the subject is mentioned explicitly, as with the form of cuki V-ki
where the personal pronoun is obligatory. When used with persons other than this, we
may assume that it has an emphatic value, as in e.g. English 'You go!'.

('Nosotros trabajaremos [...].')
(Vellard 1967:5)
As demonstrated in (42), imperative clauses may be elaborate and can include direct
and indirect complements. Among these more elaborate clauses, the word orders of
SOV and OSV are the most common ones, although they form only a small part of
the imperative clauses accounted for. Example (41) shows the marked word order of
OSV and the emphatic value is reflected in the translation. Since Uchumataqu is
rather free in its word order, other combinations appear as well but are exceptional.
7.5.1 Optative clauses
Optative clauses express a yet unfulfilled proposition and are thus not marked with
declarative -cay. The particular morphological marker of Optative clauses is irrealis aca or its allomorph -co, respectively (cf. 5.8.2.2).

505The marker is not used on its own to indicate person but is combined with person

assumption is supported by the fact that the subject marker is not required by the
verb, in contrast to object marker s-. Furthermore, there is evidence of verbs that do
not bear subject marker -s, although a first person is the subject. Therefore, I propose
an emphatic status of subject marker -s although it cannot be excluded that the
marker once was obligatory and its non-obligatoriness is due to language attrition (cf.
5.4.1). (67) represents an instance where first person singular is expressed by means
of a clitic element in combination with subject marker -s and future tense marker -a.

(Métraux 1935:97)It is uncerain why declarative -cay is missing from the clause.
Except for one case where neither pronouns nor clitic elements appear
Temporal relationship based on Vellard229CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEMDespite their difference in status, object marker s- and subject marker -5 are closely
related and can be imagined as bracketing the verb, i.e. either J-V (OB 1-Verb) or V-s
(Verb-su). That is, a first person is marked either as object preceding the verb stem
or as subject immedately following it.
Subject marker -s is sometimes represented in the form of -i. The forms occur in
free alternation and are not distributed according to phonological criteria, but -.v is the
most common form and according to my proposed spelling (cf. 2.14), the subject
marker is represented as -5. There are no restrictions with respect to verb class.
5.4.3 Object marker -n
The verbal form -n marks the direct object of a clause. Therefore, the marker is
labeled object marker (OB2) but in contrast to object marker s- it marks second
person singular to third person plural as object, although the marker refers to third
person singular mainly. In some cases, the direct object is overtly expressed and the
object marker -n is then redundant, as in (68)507 whereas in other cases it is not, as in
(69).

(Métraux 1935:107)As can be seen from the examples, object marker -n is preceded by subject marker s
and followed by person marking suffixes, such as first person singular -u or future
tense marking -a I -aki (cf. 5.4.2). Object marker -n does not appear with motion,
stative, and position verbs (see 5.4.1) but with transitive verbs it occurs without
restriction. Depending on verb semantics it can even designate a reflexive, as in (70).

(Métraux 1935:96)With repect to person reference, we find that the subject is almost always indicated,
either by person marking suffixes in the verb or by the use of pronouns, whereas the
object is hardly ever overtly expressed. This leads to the assumption that object

As indicated in the glosses cer means 'to see, look'. According to Vellard (1967'2), it is translated here
as 'to wait for'.
soil230UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAmarker -n alone is sufficient in order to mark the object, and we may also assume that
it is obligatory, similar to object marker s-. However, there are a few cases in which
the marker -n is not used although one would expect it to appear (cf. example 64). It
is possible that in cases such as (64) object marker -n is considered redundant since
the direct object is expressed overtly (tusa 'balsa raft'). However, in other cases the
non-application of object marker -« may also be ascribed to language attrition. Object
marker -n does not have allomorphs and is not restricted with respect to tense.
5.5 Valence-changing suffixes: causative -sna
The term 'valence', as used here, refers to the number of participants a verb must
have, i.e not the number of arguments present in a clause but rather the number of
participants expected to be there. The first can be referred to as ""grammatical or
syntactic valence"", the latter as ""semantic valence"" (Payne 1997:169f). There are two
reasons for a description in terms of semantic valence: first, in many cases
Uchumataqu does not express participants overtly but context or other devices
contribute to the understanding. Thus, the number of actual arguments is sometimes
zero509. Second, the translations given in the data do not always reflect the number of
arguments in a clause and I therefore decided to analyse the following section in
terms of semantic valence.
The only valence decreasing operation is the application of State marking -tni I
-tin. However, since this derivational process results in adjectives but not in verbs it
will not be treated in the folowing section. For a more detailed discussion of
adjectival states, cf. 4.3.5 and for a passive-like construction, see 5.2.1.
The database on possible verbal causative -sna (CAU) is rather small and most of
its instances are not entirely clear. Therefore, the interpretation of -sna as causative is
uncertain itself and all following statements should be regarded as speculative. The
interpretation of the form -sna as causative is in part inspired by Uhle (1894:101).
One aspect that puts the interpretation of -sna as causative in doubt is that it is
identical to the morpheme combination of subject marker, object marker, and first
person singular future tense {-s-n-a-) (cf. 5.4). We may assume that context leads to a
different reading between the latter and a possible causative meaning. However, if sna indeed marks a causative it increases verbal valence.

morphological means, i.e. by attaching the suffix -sna to a verb (cf. examples 72 and
73) or, second, by lexical means. A suitable example of the latter are the verbs tiL·'to die' and kona- 'to kill'. However, nothing can be said about other means to
express a causative, e.g. periphrastic ways.","[245, 246, 247]"

7.7 Predicate clauses
The following description of predicate clauses is based on Payne (1997:1 Uff). On
the basis of word order and morphological marking five different types of predicate
clauses can be distinguished.
7.7./ Equative predicate clauses
The first type is what Payne (1997:114) calls equative predicate clauses: ""Equative
clauses are those which assert that a particular entity (the subject of the clause) is
identical to the entity specified in the predicate nominal, [...]."" (marking by the
author). Payne further distinguishes proper inclusion640 from equative predicate
clauses, but in Uchumataqu equative predicate clauses and proper inclusion are
expressed the same way, a common feature as Payne (ibid.) points out.
In most equative predicate clauses, the predicate occurs without an overtly
expressed subject and is marked by declarative -cay (1). This makes them the
morphologically least marked predicate clauses.

combinations never occur, although in theory they could and therefore, it remains
likewise uncertain whether these morphemes occupy the same slot or different ones.

only be assumed.

nominalising suffixes action nominahser -s(i) and subject relativiser -m are preceded by suffixes from
column 2 However, no such case is found in the sources and their integration into column 2 is based on
their usage as shown in the sources. A slash marks allophones Glosses added except for the forms ke- and
-lay, which are lexicalised138U C H U M A T A Q U : THE LOST L A N G U A G E OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAclose to the verb stem and are thus closer than most inflectional morphemes.
However, Bybee (1985:34f) proposes the following hierarchy of verbal inflectional
morphology:
V-aspect-tense-mood-person
Bybee's scheme cannot be entirely established for Uchumataqu, where we find a
reversed order of tense and mood marking suffixes. This may be in part due to the
fact that some of the tense marking suffixes also serve for person reference, i.e. -w
and -a not only mark tense but also denote first person singular, while -acu marks
present tense with first person plural inclusive. The same is true for imperative,
jussive, and exhortative markers -a, -x, and -/a, which also express person reference.
As Bybee (1985:34) notes: ""[...] there are many cases in which it is impossible to
discern the relative order of two morphemes because they are fused together in
portmanteau expression."" (italics by the author). Part of the divergent order in
Uchumataqu may be therefore ascribed to these portmanteau morphemes.
3.4 Compounding and incorporation
Compounding and incorporation are means to create new lexical items and therefore,
they are derivational processes. I will first consider nominal compoundig before
turning to noun incorporation processes.
The sections are structured as follows: after providing a brief definition of
compounding and incorporation, I will outline methodological means to establish
these processes and their applicability to the Uchumataqu data. Following these
considerations, I will present compounding and incorporation as found in the data
and provide examples of their usage. Finally, I will address some borderline cases
and problems.
3.4.1 Nominal compounding
Accordig to Bauer (2006:719), ""[a] compound is usually defined [...] as a word that is
made up of two other words.""289. As elaborated in the literature, it is somewhat
problematic to distinguish compounds from phrases, since both are the result of
combining independent items into larger, meaningful units (cf. Anderson 1985:40).
Several criteria help to identify compounds, including phonological peculiarities and
particularly the stress pattern, but as outlined in chapter 2, these measures are less
reliable for Uchumataqu. However, morphophonological processes, such as the use
of linking elements or elision of the final vowel may indicate whether an item is
perceived as one word or two. Linking elements often indicate clearly that the object
is indeed a compound, but elision of final vowels is frequent in Uchumataqu and
therefore can never be the single criterion for establishing compounds. With respect
to morphology, we find that inflection occurs only on the last element of a compound
(cf. Bauer 2006:723) and thus, an item such as kot' suni-naka 'the Uru people'
(Vellard 1967:3) can be interpreted as a compound290. Another means of establishingAnderson (1985 40) points out that a compound can consist of more than two words.
Please note that this claim receives additional support by the elision of final /a/ on kola 'lake'.","[153, 154, 155]"
"(Vellard 1967:14)Therefore, the most reliable means to establish noun incorporation are semantic (as is
the case with nominal compounding), i.e. the degree of lexicalisation and
compositionality. In some cases, morphological markers, such as clitics, indicate that
the item in question is not an instance of noun incorporation.
Uchumataqu hardly ever employs noun incorporation and there are indeed only
a few instances that could be interpreted as such. In comparison to the more common
nominal compounding, noun incorporation appears to be exceptional. What may beCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS143said of Uchumataqu noun incorporation is that in most cases a direct objet is
incorporated into a (transitive) action-process verb and the resulting compounds are
verbs or nouns. The few instances of noun incorporation suggest that they are
exocentric (e.g. 39 and 40), in contrast to nominal compounding, which is mainly
endocentric. Word order is OV in all but one case. Since the number of possible
instances is limited, nothing can be said about particular semantic fields where noun
incorporation occurs.

The following example is in two ways outstanding. First, it is the only example
where a subject is incorporated into an intransitive motion verb, and second, we find
a reversed order of verb and subject.

'smallpox'(Vellard 1951:22)In sum, I would like to conclude that noun incorporation does not seem to be a
regular means of deriving new lexical items in Uchumataqu. Whereas nominal
compounding is used frequently, noun incorporation appears to be rather occasional
and limited to a few items only. It is possible that this restriction is in part due to the
more regular use of chain verb constructions or that Uchumataqu syntactic structure
already resembles noun incorporation by not marking a direct object, which in most
cases is immediately followed by the verbal predicate. It is unlikely that the lack of
noun incorporation is due to language attrition since nominal compounding is
testified for every source.
5.5 Reduplication
Uchumataqu has two types of reduplication: partial and complete reduplication.
Partial reduplication refers to the process of reduplicating initial or final syllables as
Hyphen set by me.
The form -sa cannot be explained but it may be possible that it is an instance of declarative -cay
Hyphen set by Vellard. It probably denotes a syllable boundary and does not mark a suffix.","[159, 160]"
"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS135Uchumataqu affixes can be characterised by the so-called ""relevance principle"", as
presented by Bybee (1985:15f): ""[...] semantic elements that are highly relevant to
one another are likely to be packaged together and expressed lexically, or will be the
most common inflectional or derivational categories."". That is, categories that are
generally thought of as most relevant, such as tense, aspect, mood, number, and case
are expressed in Uchumataqu as either derivational or inflectional (bound)
morphemes.
For the distinction between derivation and inflection, I would like to follow
Booij (2006:654, 656): ""The distinction between inflection and derivation is
primarily a functional one: it refers to different functions of morphological processes,
the creation of different forms of lexemes versus the creation of different lexemes."",
and further ""[...] derivation may change the syntactic category of its input forms,
whereas inflection is always category-neutral. [...] [I]nflection creates forms of the
same lexeme, unlike derivation, which determines the lexical category of the lexemes
it creates."". Thus, by derivation I understand that the application of a grammatical,
bound morpheme can change the syntactic category of its host. Inflectional affixes do
not have this ability.
Based on this definition, I view action nominaliser -s(i), subject relativiser -ni,
related State marking -tni (and its allomorph -tin) as well as causative -sna (and its
allomorph -ska) to be derivational. The following examples demonstrate their usage.
Both action nominaliser -s(i) and subject relativiser -ni nominalise a verb stem
and these suffixes thus match the criterion for derivational affixes. Please consider
examples (21) and (22).

and thus, both these markers are considered derivational (see examples 23 and 24).

verb stem to which -sna (or -ska) is attached remains a verb. However, attaching the
causative morpheme has syntactic and semantic implications, as expressed by Booij
(2006:656): ""[...] the derivation of causative verbs leads to the creation of transitive
verbs that indicate the obligatory presence of a direct object [...]. Hence, the
derivation of causative verbs has syntactic relevance."". Apart from this syntactic
impact, derivation of causative verbs often leads to a semantic difference, which
sometimes results in lexical causatives, such as e.g. 'to eat' and 'cause somebody to
eat = to feed'. The Uchumataqu causative fits into this scheme, since it introduces a
new participant286 and produces new lexical items.

'to cause someone to speak = to teach someone'
(Métraux 1935:103,96)(26)kaxa
pkaxsna-cay'debt'

(Uhle 1894:100)Example (27) presents a lexical causative:
(27)tiks-'to die'kona- 'to kill'(Métraux 1935:101, 108)Another possible example of a lexical causative is the verb skata- 'to send' (Vellard
1967:9), which could have been constructed of causative -ska and the verb ta: 'to
give', meaning 'to cause somebody to give = to send'. Problematic is that the
potential causative form precedes the verb stem, which otherwise must not be the
case. If skata- has indeed been derived this way, we may assume that it has been
completely lexicalised at the time of documentation. Since further examples are
missing, this has to remain speculative.
In sum, the majority of Uchumataqu affixes is inflectional and only the forms
discussed above are considered derivational.
With respect to the order of affixes, ""[i]t is often observed that derivational
morphemes occur closer to the root to which they attach than inflectional morphemes
do"" (Bybee 1985:33). In Uchumataqu, we find that on nouns and pronouns the plural
marker precedes case suffixes, which themselves can be followed by clausal clitics.
This observation is in accordance with Bybee's findings (1985:34)287. In most cases,
adjectives and adverbs are zero marked. However, if they take markers, we find a
situation similar to nouns, i.e. case markers (on adverbs) or predicator -kasi (on both
categories) are attached directly to the stem and can be followed by clausal clitics.
Only verbs tend to have a higher number of affixes, although it rarely exceeds two
affixes per verb stem. This limitation makes it somewhat difficult to determine the
position an affix can take, i.e. although it may be attached directly to the stem, it is
The form -sna occurs with (transitive) cognition (e.g. sis- 'to know') and utterance verbs (e.g. cis- 'to
speak') as well as with (intransitive) states, which then become transitive. Its allomorph -ska appears only
with (transitive) action and action-process verbs (e.g cer- 'to see, look at' and kos- 'to break')

"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS139compounds is their syntactic behaviour, i.e. since compounds form a single part of
speech, they syntactically behave as any other member of this class and occupy an
appropriate position (e.g. clause initial in case the compound is a noun functioning as
a subject). As will be shown with greater detail in chapter 7, Uchumataqu has a
relatively free word order, and although it is in principle SOV, nearly every word
order is possible and thus, the position an item can take does not provide much
evidence. However, if an item occurs repeatedly as a unit in the sources and its
components are never split up by other constitutents (as is the case with kot ' sum),
then it is likely to be a compound. The last criteria to be mentioned are semantic: the
""degree of lexicalised meaning"" and the ""degree of compositionality"" (Anderson
1985:44). The meaning of a compound is often more than the sum of its parts and
lexicalised. Consider (28):
(28)p-cincu
bird
'wing'kara
hand
(Lehmann 1929b: 1)In establishing compounds on a semantic base, I interpret those items as compounds
that occur with some frequency in the sources291 and / or whose meaning is noncompositional. This is not without obstacles, either: an item still documented in e.g.
Uhle (1894) may be already lost in e.g. Métraux (1935) although it was lexicalised.
In some cases, the sources offer divergent translations for the same item, which can
make the status of the item in question doubtful. In other cases, the appearance of an
object is that of a compound but with respect to semantics, a lexicalised meaning is
less likely, as demonstrated in example (29).
(29)tuxsfaj kuya-cay
foreign house-DEC
'it is a house of others; an Aymara house292 (Vellard 1967:7)Example (29) shows an object which at first sight could be understood as a
compound since two words follow each other immediately and inflection (i.e.
declarative -cay) occurs on the second component. However, with respect to
frequency of use, it is less likely that an expression such as this would have become
lexicalised and furthermore, it is compositional and thus, instances such as example
(29) are not regarded as compounds293.1 would like to point out that for establishing
compounds I rely mainly on semantic criteria, which can be supported by
morphophonological, morphological, and syntactic findings.
Uchumataqu makes frequent use of compounding, particularly with kinship
terms and body parts. Uchumataqu compounds can be understood as consisting of a
head and its modifier, the head being nominal whereas the modifier can be another
noun, an adjective, or an adverb. The order is modifier-head. Consider (30) to (32):2,1Which points to their lexicalised status.
tuxsa means 'foreign' but is mainly used to denote the Aymara people.
Another semantic test for the compound status are paraphrases (Anderson 1985 42). However, this
cannot be tested since the sources do not offer periphrastic descriptions (in Uchumataqu) for compounds.

true, then the Uchumataqu speakers borrowed both components from Aymara,
'glued' them together by means of linking element -/, and derived a new meaning for
the resulting item.

be considered a compound since the element -s (or *-) is reminiscent of third person

expression for 'hunger' consists of two lexical items.

"Table 4.16: Morphosyntactic and semantic features of adjectives4.3.1 Attributive function
Attributive adjectives qualify a noun in some way. It seems that the only possible
word order for attributive adjectives is that they precede the subject (123), (124). If
this is true, the only exceptions from the regular word order appear with predicative
adjectives but not with adjectives in attributive function.

"UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA2767.4 Declarative clauses
In general, declarative clauses ""convey assertions, expressions of belief, reports,
conclusions, narratives, assessment of likelihood, expressions of doubt [...]."" (Sadock
and Zwicky 1985:165). On the basis of this definition I subsume under the heading of
declarative every clause that carries the declarative marker -cay. This includes
clauses in the past, present, and future tense as well as clauses built with irrealis -aca
(cf. 5.8.2; with the exception of the Optative). In contrast to imperative or
interrogative clauses, declarative clauses express the highest degree of certainty on
the speaker's side, even though they can be marked with irrealis -aca622.
Following Sadock's and Zwicky's categorisation, Uchumataqu could potentially
be a marked declarative language due to its suffix -cay. However, I consider it to be a
language with unmarked declaratives since the word order in declarative clauses
serves as the basis for other deviating clause types, such as e.g. interrogatives or
imperatives (cf. Sadock and Zwicky 1985:165).
Although Uchumataqu is relatively free with respect to this623, its basic word
order is SOV (Uhle 1894:12b, Torero 2002:477).

"(Métraux 1935:104)In sum, the most common word order in adjectival predicate clauses is: adjective
inflected with declarative -cay followed by a demonstrative pronoun inflected with
topic marker -ki. When there are adverbs, they precede the entire construction.
For adjectives in predicative function one can state that the subject mostly
precedes the adjective while adverbs are free in their position according to focus and
the speaker's intention435.
4.3.3 Predicator -kasi
Predicator -kasi is attached to adjectives as well as to adverbs. A word must be said
on adverbs. Adverbs inflected with -kasi are treated here under the heading of
'adjectives'. The predicator -kasi is an element that distinguishes nouns from
adjectives and therefore places adverbs nearer to the adjectival space, so adverbs
inflected with the predicator are discussed together with adjectives (cf. 6.1.3 to
6.1.5). The reason -kasi is not treated as an adverbial suffix is that its most important
task is the predication of adjectives. Therefore, -kasi is viewed as an adjectival435At least theoretically we may assume that adverbs in adjectival predicate clauses are free in position as
well, but no examples for another ordering can be found.",[218]

The term complement is understood here as an argument required by the semantics of
the matrix verb. The following discussion654 will be restricted to non-finite
complement clauses since finite complement clauses in Uchumataqu have the shape
of juxtaposed matrix clauses and are thus treated under the heading of coordination
(e.g. example 81).The data suggest that Uchumataqu allows for object complements
only.
Non-finite complement clauses are built with either chain verb constructions or
action nominaliser -s(i) (cf. 5.6 and 5.7). What is called chain verb constructions here
differs from typical serial verb constructions since the chained verbs of Uchumataqu
do not denote aspects of one action or event but refer to different actions or events.
However, one action or event is usually dependent on the other. Furthermore, I would
like to point out that the data on complement clauses is limited and show little
variation with respect to the matrix verb (they are almost exclusively limited to
volition verbs). It is particularly with action nominaliser -s(i) that we lack entire
clauses in the data. This marker occurs mainly with singular items where an infinitive
is required.
Chain verb constructions are indicated by zero marking of the complement verb,
i.e. it carries neither person, tense or aspect markers nor declarative -cay.

Although the sources offer satifactory data on future and present tense, the data on
past tense are fragmentary and often confusing. However, it is possible to single out
two different verbal past tense markers, which are -u and -ku, but there are analytical
problems. One reason why the data, particularly on -ku, are confusing is that it also
functions as a subordination marker (see 5.7.1). However, a distinction is made by
the application of declarative -cay. For subordination, the subordinate verb takes -ku,
while the finite verb is inflected with declarative -cay. This means that a verb
inflected with -ku and bearing the declarative marks past tense instead of
subordination. Due to the crucial difference the use of -cay makes, we may assume
that it is obligatory for past tense verbs to take the declarative in order to be
understood as past marking forms. With respect to morphemes preceding -u, we find
subject marker -s and and object marker -n (23, 24) (cf. 5.1.1).

open, but the author provides detailed ethnographic description of the Uru and their
community. The article consists of 29 pages and is concerned with the economy,
paying particular attention to hunting and fishing, agriculture, food, clothing, house
types, balsa rafts, crafting, and religious aspects, i.e. it covers almost every aspect of
life. However, the linguistic data supplied is rather small and comprise only nineteen
items, none of which occurs in a grammatical context. These items refer to different
types of nets, parts of the clothing as well as the words for house, kuia, (Palavecino
1949:75) and balsa raft, tusi55, (Palavecino 1949:77). Although Palavecino's items
are congruent with the lexical material of other sources, due to their small number
they do not provide a further contribution to the current study and they are therefore
relevant only for the lexicon.
Palavecino (1949:73, 83) mentions the names of Tomas Kespi and Severiano
Wila and it is thus likely that they were two of his consultants. Apart from this, no
additional information is given but it seems justified to propose that Palavecino relied
on an interpreter who spoke Aymara and Spanish. As a final remark, it should be
added that Palavecino's ethnographic data can be considered informative and the
drawings provided within the article are extraordinarily exact and detailed.
1.4.2 Major studies: lexical and grammatical material
In what follows, I will present the sources that contribute most to the current study,
i.e. they represent my major sources of information. They will be treated in
chronological order.
1.4.2.1 Max Uhle (1856-1944)
Max Uhle was bom in Dresden in 1856 and in 1875 started to study linguistics at the
University of Leipzig. Uhle left the University in 1880 with a doctoral degree56. On
request of the Königliches Museum för Völkerkunde in Berlin Uhle travelled to
Argentina and Bolivia between 1892 and 1894. It was his first visit to South America
and during this field trip he collected the data on Uchumataqu analysed in the current
work. In the following years, Uhle kept working in South America and although he
was originally a linguist, he became known as the ""father of Peruvian archaeology""
(Rowe 1954). Max Uhle died in Berlin in 1944.
Before turning to Uhle's data on Uchumataqu, it should be mentioned that he
also studied the closely related variety of Chipaya in the village of Huachacalla
(February 1894). Although this language is not the focus of interest here, I will
repeatedly refer to it, since Uhle himself is concerned with both varieties and does
not always make a clear distinction between them.","[45, 46]"
"CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION5the personal clitics -/, -m, and -s, which refer to first, second, and third person,
respectively. Although their usage in the sources appears to be mainly emphatic,
there are also hints that these clitics had a person marking function in a more intact
stage of Uchumataqu. This is particularly reflected in interrogative and imperative
clauses. Uchumataqu is predominantly an SOV language but it allows great variation
with respect to word order. Interrogative devices are the interrogative pronouns and
the use of question markers -ta and -xwi; the latter is an allomorph of topic marker -ki
used in questions. In most cases, declarative -cay does not occur in interrogative
clauses, although there are some yes / no questions in which it is used. Although the
number of relative clauses is severely limited in my data, it appears that they are built
with nominalising subject relativiser -ni and are prenominai in nature, corresponding
to the basic SOV word order. The available examples suggest that relativisation in
Uchumataqu is restricted to subjects.
1.1.1 Genetic affiliation
As has been mentioned at the beginning of this section, Uchumataqu and Chipaya
(subsumed as Uru-Chipaya; cf. below) are considered to belong to an isolated
language family. However, several propositions concerning the genetic affiliation of
Uru-Chipaya have been made. Crequi-Montfort and Rivet (1925-27) suggested that
they are related to Pukina, a language mentioned by Ore (1607) that became extinct
in the 17th century. This suggestion was probably inspired by the name Pukina given
to Uchumataqu by the speakers themselves (cf. 1.3.1). The same authors (1926:121139, 1927:57-69) also brought into discussion a possible genetic relationship between
Uru-Chipaya and the Arawakan language family. However, none of these theories
could last. Olson (1964, 1965; quoted in Muysken 2001:76) proposed that (Uru)Chipaya had affinities with the Mayan languages of Meso America, a theory likewise
rejected today (cf. Campbell 1973, Adelaar and Muysken 2004). Fabre (1991)
presented an etymological vocabulary, in which he deals with Uru-Chipaya
(including Murato), the Jaqi language family, Quechua, the Pano-Takana language
family, and an Arawakan language. This approach is further developed in his article
Lexical similarities between Uru-Chipaya and Pano-Takanan languages: Genetic
relationship or areal diffusion? (1995), but so far no genetic affiliation could be
substantiated. Thus, it appears best to refer to Uru-Chipaya as an isolated language
family of the Bolivian Altipiano (Muysken 2001:76).
1.1.2 Uchumataqu compared with Chipaya
Chipaya is the only member of the Uru-Chipaya4 linguistic family that is still in use
today. It has approximately 1,800 native speakers in the communitiy Santa Ana de
Chipaya near Lake Coipasa in southwest Bolivia. Chipaya is highly endangered due
to an increasing influence of Spanish in modem Bolivian society and a shift to
Aymara. Uchumataqu and Chipaya are considered to be as closely related as French4In 2001 the Nacwn Originaria Um (NOU) was formed in Oraro and consists of several groups, who
consider themselves to be of Uru origin. However, none of them speaks a Uru-Chipaya language any
more, with the exception of the Chipaya.","[21, 22]"

In contrast to adverbial clauses, relative clauses modify a noun or noun phrase (cf.
Payne 1997:325). In Uchumataqu, relative clauses are built with the subject
relativiser -ni, the same morpheme that also functions in manner adverbial clauses665.
The database on Uchumataqu relative clauses is limited and in some instances, the
translations do not support a relative clause interpretation. However, it seems
possible to establish two types of relative clauses. In accordance with basic SOV
order, relative clauses are prenominai, i.e. the relative clause precedes its head noun.

'a sorcerer (lit.: a man who knows)'(Métraux 1935:106)In the following example (102), the relative clause of the first example becomes the
head noun. Thus, sisni 'sorcerer' has to be regarded as a lexicalised expression, and
cannot be analysed the same way as in example (101), since the relative clause
follows its head noun.

adjectives, and numerals and occurs only with possessive marking -ci It is unlikely
that reduplication of possessive -ci is lexicalised since every word bearing
reduplicated -ci has a basic, non-reduplicated form Furthermore, reduplication of -ci
is exceptional since in the majority of all cases, the marker is not reduplicated Thus,
the function of this reduplication type is not entirely clear but it is possible that it
denotes a very close and possibly inalienable kind of possession If this assumption is
true, reduplication of -ci could be considered to be augmentative in function

supported by its use on numerals (cf 4 4) Vellard (1951 17ff) reports the
reduplication to appear on every numeral higher than ten (cf example 76)
In conclusion, I would like to state that reduplication must have been a fairly
productive means of stem modification once, but lexicalisation has often obscured its
meaning This is particularly the case with verbs However, with adjectives, nouns,
and pronouns some regularities can be detected Adjectives mainly reduplicate their
initial syllable and due to their semantics convey only an augmentative meaning,
whereas nouns and pronouns show partial or complete reduplication In contrast to
adjectives, nominal reduplication can have the function of plurality but only with
complete reduplication
3 6 Parts of speech
According to Payne (1997 32, bold marking by the author), ""grammatical
categories are called 'parts of speech'"" or are sometimes also referred to as ""lexical
categones"" The lexical content of an Uchumataqu word is sometimes hard to grasp
due to diverging or even missing translations Therefore, I will classify Uchumataqu
categones primarily on the basis of their structural and functional properties, ι e
according to their morphosynatctic behaviour Pursuing this approach the following
parts of speech can be established nouns, adjectives, and verbs Two somewhat
special cases are particles and so-called phrases, ι e fixed expressions found in
everyday life's communication Particles do not form a word class of their own but
do not belong to another word class either Phrases, even less than particles, do not
form a grammatical category but will be treated here as a final remark on
Uchumataqu parts of speech They differ syntactically from prototypical noun or verb
phrases and clause types and thus will not be considered in chapter 7
Although it is well possible to establish three grammatical categories the
boundanes between them are not always clear-cut (cf Schachter 1985 6, Payne
1997 32) These overlaps are observed for other languages too and go as far as to
bring into question the traditional distinction between the different categories (cf
Croft 2003 183)
In what follows, I will use the terms 'grammatical category' and 'parts of
speech' alike to refer to the Uchumataqu categones Further, I would like to point out
that for the subsequent outline of the classification of Uchumataqu parts of speech, I
roughly follow Schachter (1985) and Payne (1997)UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA1503.6.1 Nouns
Notions most typically associated with nouns are time-stability (Payne 1997:33) and
referentiality (Croft 2003:185) to ""persons, places, and things"" (Schachter 1985:7),
the latter concepts considered to be prototypically encoded by nouns.
Payne (1997:33)3'5 lists as functional properties of nouns their ability to act as the
head of noun phrases, to serve as either subject or object of a clause, and to be most
commonly the topic of texts. The head of a noun phrase can be characterised as ""the
one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers
to"" (Payne 1997:33) (cf. 77).
(77)co:k lu.si
big
jar
'abigjar'(Métraux 1935:94)Example (77) is about ajar, not about co.k 'big', which only specifies the type of jar.
That is, the phrase itself refers to lu.si 'jar', but not to co.k and therefore, lu.si is the
head of the phrase.
Another function of nouns is as predicates and as such, no particular marking or
copulative device is required. Please consider (78).
(78)paya
koya-cay
adobebrick house-DEC
'This is an αί/oèe-house (= a house made from adobe bricks).'
(Vellard 1967:7)The role of a predicate is usually reserved for verbs. When nouns are used as
predicates without particular marking, the distinction between nouns and verbs
becomes blurred316.
Despite this overlap between verbs and nouns, the latter can be set apart by their
ability to function as the subject of a clause (examples 78 and 79).
(79)hep-[p]im-s
kuyla manti-cay311
father-AFF-CL=3 house rule-DEC
'The father rules [in] the house.'","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]"
"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS159The verb classes are structurally not distinctive, i.e. every member of every verb class
can be inflected with e.g. future tense -aki. However, the verb classes select different
nominal case markers (for further discussion, cf. chapter 4).
In sum, on the basis of their functional properties verbs are not always easily
distinguished from nouns and with respect to function we find a considerable overlap
between these categories. As has been shown for nouns and adjectives there are no
clear-cut boundaries between the several parts of speech in Uchumataqu. However, in
terms of their structural properties verbs can be set apart from other word classes by
their ability to be marked for tense, apect, and mood. These concepts are encoded
verbally and are not found on any other grammatical category in Uchumataqu.
The following table summarises what has been said about the three main grammatical
categories in Uchumataqu. Shaded areas denote overlaps between categories. Please
note that adjectival subcategories are not considered.

3.6.4 Particles and phrases
The following section deals with items that do not belong to the word classes
presented above, and no feature can be established that classifies them as a category
of their own. With one exception, to be discussed below none of these lexical items
takes particular morphological marking except for personal and clausal clitics.
Furthermore, negation ana 'no, not' is the only expression that occurs in all
documents while the remaining particles appear in only one source. Therefore, they
cannot be cross-checked and verified and thus, it remains uncertain whether the itemsUCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA160in question truly form part of the Uchumataqu lexicon and how and when they were
used Based on these considerations I will present a list of the particles found in the
sources but except for a few cases will not discuss them further Negation ana will be
presented in greater detail in chapter 6

express positive confirmation, the sources on Uchumataqu (including Vellard) agree
on that the notion 'yes' is expressed by repetition of the verb form (cf 113a and b)
(113) abkun tam

'Did you (sg) catch [itp'
tan-u-cay

equivalent, it remains largely uncertain whether hi-lay is a regular form, under which314Uchumataqu forms alphabetically ordered Slashes denote alternative formsCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS161circumstances it could be used, and what the difference is between hi-lay and
repetition of the verb form.
Next is isu-cay 'so, that' (Vellard 1949:151), which is probably a loan from
Spanish eso 'this, that' (cf. 2.11) and thus, we do not know whether the form ka:yaca: (Uhle 1894:2) represents the original Uchumataqu expression. Furthermore, Uhle
did not specify whether this item is from Chipaya or Uchumataqu.
Likewise uncertain is the use of sipi 'when, if, as given by Polo (1901:476).
Notions of mood and modality are usually expressed by irrealis -aca (cf. 5.8.2) and
thus, the use of a presumably unbound morpheme such as sipi appears to be striking.
It is possible that the first part is a loan from Spanish si meaning 'when, if335 but in
this case, the second element *-pi remains unanalysable. I would like to point to
Cuzco Quechua where a similar phenomenon can be observed. In this dialect,
Spanish si in its meaning 'when, if is combined with -chus which itself consists of
negation and question marking -chu and Reportative -s(i) (Cusihuamân 1976:248).
The resulting form sichus is likewise translated as 'when, if (cf. Valderrama and
Escalante 1977, Hannß 2004). However, since sipi is a single instance and its second
component remains elusive nothing further can be said about it.
Another element to be discussed is somewhat exceptional to the previous ones
since wajasiki23*' 'that's why' comprises a form -siki which can be analysed as the
locative marker (cf. 4.1.1.3). The element *waja- does not occur elsewhere and we
may assume that wajasiki is lexicalised, provided it is a regular form of Uchumataqu
at all.
Finally, Uhle (1894:113, 54.1) presents two particles related to Aymara. The
expression winaya 'always' is a direct loan from Aymara337 (DeLucca 1983:853)
while waligara, which is translated by Uhle as 'like'338, comprises the form wali
meaning 'well' or 'much' (DeLucca 1983:444). The form wali itself is used as an
adverb in Uchumataqu (cf. 6.1.4) but the element *-gara cannot be established for
neither Aymara nor Uchumataqu. The notion of comparative 'like' is expressed in
Aymara by the bound grammatical morpheme -jama (DeLucca 1983:606), whereas
Uchumataqu uses separative -kistana. Therefore, the form waligara remains largely
unanalysable. The remaining forms do not show any peculiarities or relations to other
bound or free morphemes.
In what follows, I do not interpret the term 'phrase' in its syntactic sense but
rather in a pragmatic way, i.e. as a fixed expression that serves in daily
communication. As such, these phrases form a closed set. They are not a part of
speech as are e.g. adjectives but neither do they belong to a particular clause type (cf.
chapter 7) for they are fixed and do not allow much morphological or syntactic
variation. Therefore, these expressions are treated as a final remark on the parts of
speech Uchumataqu comprises.
The majority of these phrases comes from Vellard (1949, 1951) and is thus
subject to the same source-related restrictions as are particles. Some of the phrases
It can also mean 'yes'
As a quotation, the form waja- is maintained and not adopted to the Irohito alphabet
Uhle points to this.
Likewise for not specified for its origin Uhle himself is doubtful about the meaning of waligara.","[175, 176, 177, 178]"

them. A son and his family live in the neighbouring house as does Lorenzo Inda's
nephew Cyriaco Inda and his family. All of them, exept Lorenzo Inda's wife, speak
Aymara and Spanish. Nine other childen of Lorenzo Inda had moved away for
working. Lorenzo Inda, bom 1947, has always been engaged in political and social
issues of his village. Thus, he was appointed subalcalde43 of Waki and in this
function, was invited to a meeting of American indigenous groups, which was held in
Colombia. Apart from this political function, Lorenzo Inda has always been very
engaged in keeping Uchumataqu alive and attended a workshop at THOA (Taller de
Historia Oral Andina, Workshop on Andean Oral History) to do his own field-work
with Eduardo Inta44. However, the results remained unpublished (Muysken m.s.
2007:5). It is to say that Lorenzo Inda was bom at a time when Uchumataqu was not
acquired as a native language any more and thus, he learned parts of the language by
listening to older people's conversations, particularly those of Carlos Kispe and Luis
Inta45 (Muysken m.s. 2007:5). Therefore, Lorenzo Inda may not be termed a native
speaker in a strict sense but rather as a rememberer. However, next to Julia Vila he
contributed most to the booklet El idioma Uchumataqu (2005), for which Pieter
Muysken was advisory linguist.
I worked mainly with Lorenzo Inda and to a lesser degree with Cyriaco Inda.
Sometimes a word or phrase was contributed by another member of the community
but indeed the main body of words was provided by Lorenzo Inda. This has only in
part to do with the actual knowledge of Uchumataqu but is more related to the social
status of each community member. That is, Lorenzo Inda is perceived as an authority
not only on Uchumataqu but on several issues relating to the social and political life
of Irohito. It would have been therefore considered highly impolite to utter one's
view before Lorenzo Inda had expressed his opinion and thus, I cannot make a
statement on other community members' competence on Uchumataqu, since they
only supplied information when asked to do so by Lorenzo Inda. Apparently, there
are no women left who know parts of Uchumataqu.
Lorenzo Inda, his nephew Cyriaco and I met every day and worked on
vocabulary concerning kinship terms, body parts, numerals, the name of some
astronomical phenomena, the translation of the songs published in El idioma
Uchumataqu (2005), and particularly the names of birds, types of totora and other
aquatic plants, types of nets and tools, to which detailed drawings were added. We
also worked on teaching material, consisting of three booklets, which should contain
words and phrases from Uchumataqu together with some ethnographic information46.
The linguistic data obtained during my visit, however, do not add new
information to the study of Uchumataqu, but indeed are much the same as already
published by Lorenzo Inda himself (1988) and Pieter Muysken (2000, 2001, 2005).
43This can be roughly equated with the function of subsecretary to a mayor.

We also organised a workshop in La Paz, which brought together emigrants from Irohito, currently
living in La Paz and people with interest in the Urn culture and language. One of the aims of this workshop
was to publish the teaching material on Uchumataqu However, financial support has not yet been secured
4445CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION25Thus, I view the data collected by me rather as a further confirmation of the results
and statements on Uchumataqu published in recent studies. They do, however, not
contribute to the grammatical description attempted in the current study.
1.4 Description of the sources
In what follows, an analysis of the early sources consulted in this study is presented.
For each source, I will briefly present the personal and academic background of the
researcher before turning to an introduction to his work(s). This introduction
comprises a description of the contents of the work(s) as well as the circumstances
under which the data were collected. Each description is concluded by a personal
evaluation of the work(s) presented.
It has to be noted that the database on Uchumataqu is restricted and not in every
case quantity of data ensures quality of data, i.e. there are differences due to the
temporal (and in Lehmann's case geographical) distance of the sources. These
differences are considered as far as possible. However, the linguistic analysis is
already complex and in some cases the database for a specific phenomenon is
severely limited so that every single instance ofthat particular phenomenon has to be
taken into consideration in order to reach a conclusion. This means that in some cases
the temporal (and geographical) restrictions imposed by the database cannot be fully
considered. However, in order to ensure an equal treatment of the data, I propose the
following procedure. For evaluation I take into consideration the aspects presented in
the description of a researcher and his work(s) on Uchumataqu, i.e. whether the
researcher was acquainted with the study of South American languages (Quechua and
/ or Aymara), how much time he spent in the community, the state of Uchumataqu,
etc. However, most important for an evaluation is the linguistic content of a
document and its reliability. Reliability of a document can only be provided by a
comparison with other sources on Uchumataqu. That is, information given in a
document is considered reliable when the same information is found in one or more
documents. The more sources confirm the information of a particular document the
more reliable it becomes. However, not every document demonstrates the same
degree of reliability. When a particular information is confirmed only by e.g.
Lehmann's manuscript on Ch'imu, one has to consider that the Ch'imu document
itself is less trustworthy and also less relevant for the Irohito context. Thus, this
particular information might be regarded as being doubtful, although there is
confirmation for it. Thus, for evaluation of the sources I compare their contents with
each other in order to find out how much information can be confirmed by other
sources; but I also take into consideration that some sources are more likely to
provide reliable confirmation than others.
Note that the names Ancoaqui and Irohito are used to refer to the same place. In
fact, the community of Irohito developed from the settlement of Ancoaqui (cf. 1.3.3)
and is actually surrounded by it, but the language of Ancoaqui has since long been
Aymara. However, Ancoaqui is the better known place and if at all, it is Ancoaqui
that appears on maps and thus, some of the researchers refer to Ancoaqui when
talking about Uchumataqu. I preserved this usage, although this denomination is
somewhat inexact.","[40, 41, 42]"
"CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION3CCVC. However, the most common forms are CV or CVC. With respect to stress we
find that Uchumataqu has a tendency to place stress on the penultimate syllable,
although this is not compulsory and there are exceptions from this, particularly when
a bisyllabic stem is inflected with a bisyllabic suffix or a mono- or bisyllabic verb is
inflected with first person singular markers -u or -a.
The elision of final vowels (or in some cases the deletion of the last syllable)
does not have morphological meaning in Uchumataqu, i.e. kuy' 'house' does not
denote a direct object or any other grammatical relation, although the full form would
be kuya. I therefore call these processes context-sensitive instead of
morphophonological. The context-sensitive processes comprise mainly final vowel
elision and to a lesser degree elision of consonants. In order to prevent elision, the
dummy elements -i and -u are used. Uchumataqu has a certain tendency towards
metathesis, which occurs with the present tense habitual marker -in that is
metathesised to -ni, related state adjectival marker -tni to -tin, and the locative
markers -kis and -fa/' and their allophones -ski and -siki which are built by metathesis
Uchumataqu distinguishes three major parts of speech, which are nouns,
adjectives and verbs. There is no morphological device that distinguishes particles as
a separate class and the only particle that occurs frequently is the negation particle
ana 'no, not'. Adverbs can be subsumed under either nouns or adjectives. The latter
are distinguished by the use of predicator -kasi and form an open class in
Uchumataqu. Morphological processes of Uchumataqu are primarily compounding,
only marginally noun incorporation and reduplication. Uchumataqu compounds
consist of a nominal head and a modifier, which can be another noun, an adjective, or
an adverb; the resulting compounds are endocentric or exocentric, although the latter
is exceptional. Compounding is a productive process in Uchumataqu and occurs
mainly with kinship terms and body parts. Noun incorporation, however, is hardly
ever used in Uchumataqu and the few examples found could be analysed differently.
Reduplication is another productive morphological process of Uchumataqu and
occurs with all parts of speech and can be partial or complete. With verbs,
reduplication mainly intensifies the meaning of the verb stem, while reduplicated
adjectives and nouns are augmentative or, in the case of nouns, express plurality.
Reduplication of grammatical material is mainly restricted to possessive marking -ci.
Although Uchumataqu is an agglutinative language, the average number of
affixes per word is low: nouns and pronouns tend to carry only one affix, while
adjectives and adverbs are often zero marked or have at best one bound morpheme.
This also holds for particles and numerals. Only verbs have a tendency to carry two
morphological morphemes, and verbs with three or four affixes attached are
exceptional. Uchumataqu differs from Aymara and Quechua by the low number of
affixes that occur on a stem.
Uchumataqu employs mainly suffixes, but it also has two prefixes, one of which
is lexicalised. The case marking system of Uchumataqu resembles that of Aymara
and Quechua with the exception of locative marking devices, where we find the
directional locative -kis (and its metathesised allomorph -ski), locative marker -ksi
(and the allomorph -siki) as well as yet another locative marker -ta. The latter
contrasts with locative -ksi I -siki since the form -ta does not occur with stative or4UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAposition verbs or in locational predicate clauses. Uchumataqu has six personal
pronouns, which also occur in possession marking and only for the first person
singular does a specially marked form exist: wist 'my'. However, it is likely that at
least the third person plural pronoun ninaka 'they' has been inspired by Aymara, with
which it shares plural marker -naka. This appears to be a recent development since
sources until Métraux (1935) still report the use of an ancient pronominal plural
marker -wici. Similar considerations could be applied to the pronoun of first person
plural exclusive wisnaka, which is clearly derived from first person singular wir 'Γ
and -naka, although no combination of wir with -wici occurs. Another peculiarity of
Uchumataqu's pronominal system is the form kun, which appears to be the pronoun
of second person singular and is preferrably applied in interrogative clauses, although
it occurs in sentence types too. Its function and meaning is not fully understood.
Uchumataqu has four postpositions, one of which, kos 'inside', can be inflected
with nominal locative marker -ta.
As in the majority of South American languages, the verbal system of
Uchumataqu is rather complex, although some of its aspects can be described only
vaguely due to the incomplete sources and the progressive attrition of Uchumataqu
reflected in them. In the verbal system the two prefixes mentioned above can be
observed. The marker s- appears to have been still productive at the time of
documentation and marks a first person singular as object. The second prefix keindicating 'return' had already been lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when Uchumataqu
was documented. However, the use of prefixes is exceptional among the Andean
languages. Uchumataqu has a tense system, which primarily distinguishes future /
non-future, although there are markers for past, present and future tense. Only a first
singular is clearly indicated in present and future tense by the markers -u and -a.
There are no bound morphemes for any other person, with the exception of In-Group
marker -acu referring to first plural inclusive, which, however, may have an aspectual
quality. Only a few aspectual suffixes are found in the sources, probably due to the
circumstances of data collection and the increasing attrition of Uchumataqu. Other
verbal markers are nominalising -ni and -s(i), two subordination markers, of which
only gerund -ku can be satisfactorily interpreted, and irrealis -aca, which fulfills
several functions, such as marking conditional or Deontic modality.
The general order of verbal affixes is that grammatical function marking affixes,
aspectual suffixes, subordinating and switch reference marking suffixes, the valence
changing suffix as well as nominalising and adjectival state marking suffixes cluster
around the verb stem. These suffixes appear to be mutually exclusive. They can be
followed by the validational suffix -kala, which is a verbal suffix. Mood, modality,
and portmanteau suffixes expressing tense and person are the last verbal suffixes to
be attached. Verbs can take one or two of the clausal clitics -pini, -ki, or -cay2, which
themselves can be followed by one of the personal clitics -/, -tn, or -s.
On a clausal level, Uchumataqu has the following clitics: declarative -cay, topic
marker -ki, and affirmative -pini3. Another peculiarity of Uchumataqu is the use of2
3Affirmative -pini and declarative -cay can be combined.
Which is a more recent loan from Aymara.","[19, 20, 21]"

always unmarked
4 2 3 Demonstrative Pronouns
In Uchumataqu we find two demonstrative pronouns, which are η and m Although
they occur frequently in the sources, their translation differs and their usage as shown
m the sources does not support a clear interpretation of their difference in meaning
The following interpretation is therefore in part inspired by Chipaya (cf CerronPalomino 2006 102) If we assume that Uchumataqu uses a similar system of
demonstrative pronouns, then the forms /; and m designate different levels of
proximity The element // 'this' marks greater proximity to the speaker whereas m
'that' indicates greater distance from the speaker The system of demonstrative
pronouns is therefore speaker-based and ti and m serve to point to both persons and
objects The form ti may well be connected to the numeral ci 'one' whereas m may
be connected to the personal pronoun of third person singular

"(Métraux 1935:103)5.4 Grammatical function markers
In what follows, a group of three verbal affixes is presented whose purpose is to
indicate the grammatical functions the verbal arguments fulfil in the clause500. Two
of these markers refer to first person sg and pi (OBl s- and su -s), while the third
marker refers to all other persons (OB2 -n)50]. The object markers, which are OBl sand OB2 -n, can be considered obligatory since they occur with transitive verbs that
require a direct complement. The subject marker -s is probably emphatic or
reinforcing rather than strictly obligatory, although this cannot be definitely
established. It is interesting to note that no morpheme is found which marks a person
other than first person as subject. Thus, a first person is prominent over all other
persons in the grammatical function marking system. However, this fits well in with
the overall organisation of Uchumataqu since the language also marks explicitly only
a first person singular in present and future tense tense (by the means of -u and -a,
respectively).
The following clause shows the interconnections of the clause arguments. Parts
that belong together or refer to each other are in bold or underlined, respectively.

(Métraux 1935:92)5.4.1 Object marker first person sThe verbal object marker (OBl) s- is the only prefix that was still productive at the
time Uchumataqu was documented and the productive use of prefixes sets the
language apart from Aymara and Quechua, which do not have such devices. It
constitutes a grammatical function marker since it designates a first person as object.
It is immediately followed by the verb stem (58, 59).

"(Uhle 1894:53)365(Vellard 1967:13)This function is limited to interrogative clauses since possession is otherwise
expressed by either the possessive suffix -/ (only first person singular) or by word
order (possessor-possessed) (cf. 4.1.2 and 4.2.2). Whereas it does not seem to be a
common function of the separative, we find a rather frequent use of -kistana in
interrogative clauses. There, it is attached to the basic interrogative pronoun culu'what' to form the more specific cul-k(i)sta 'why' (lit: 'what from?').

"Acknowledgements
First and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude to my promoter Pieter
Muysken, without whom this project would have been impossible. I am very grateful
for his never ending support and confidence in this project. He commented on every
section and chapter and his insightful and inspiring suggestions guided me through
the project, which was at times a difficult one. Whenever I approached him with
whatever difficulty I faced, I was given the feeling that nothing but the solution to my
problem mattered and he supported me in every possible way.
I am likewise deeply indebted to Hein van der Voort, with whom I was lucky
enough to share an office for a time. The entire manuscript and particularly the
chapter on phonology profited from his invaluable comments and incredible patience.
I would also like to thank Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke, together with Hein
van der Voort editors of this grammar. Mily Crevels and Simon van de Kerke
contributed to the manuscript with useful comments and support during the
formatting, which at times was quite challenging.
My thanks also go to Sabine Dedenbach-Salazar Saenz, who was my
copromoter in this project and the one who brought me into contact with UruChipaya. Without her very sharp eye for details, many inconsistencies and
contradictions not only in the manuscript would have gone unnoticed.
I would also like to thank Willem Adelaar for his interest in my research, his
inspiring comments on the manuscript, and his support on many other topics.
Many other people contributed to the study of Uchumataqu, either by
commenting on sections and chapters or by their helpful remarks and suggestions on
presentations: Astrid Alexander-Bakkerus, Susanne Brouwer, Hanke van Buren,
Eithne Carlin, Wolfgang Dietrich, Rafael Fischer, Rik van Gijn, Jesus Mario Giron,
Katharina Haude, Roland Hemmauer, Gertie Hoyman, Peter Masson, Sergio Meira,
Hella Olbertz, Kees Versteegh, and Otto Zwartjes. My research always profited from
their useful comments and critics. Furthermore, I would like to thank Amo Zweden,
who often was my last resort when my Dutch failed me.
I am particularly grateful to my former office mate Swintha Danielsen and to
Sonja Gipper for all the discussions we had, be they on linguistic or non-linguistic
topics. Without their opinion, advice and often enough help, things would have been
much more difficult. I hope this is the only the beginning of further collaboration.
I am also indebted to the Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin that gave me
free and uncomplicated access the invaluable manuscripts of Max Uhle and Walter
Lehmann on Uchumataqu (Uru). My thanks go particularly to Gregor Wolff, who
was very co-operative about my archive research. Furthermore, I would like to thank
Colette Grinevald, who allowed me to use her personal notes on her visit to Irohito
and provided me with interesting and useful background information on the language
situation in Bolivia.
In Bolivia, my thanks go to don Lorenzo Inda and his family in Irohito, who
hosted me and answered any of my questions, regardless whether I wished to know
something about their former language or about a trivial matter of everyday life.
Without their friendliness and hospitality, I could not have gained the insight I had inthe present-day situation of the Uru people. I am also grateful to Ciriaco Inda, who
spent his rare time with me pondering on the meaning of words and phrases. Without
Vladimir Salazar I would not have been able to meet the Inda family and I would like
to express my gratitude for his energy and unending support. Whenever I met a
problem, he tried to solve it for me and his profound knowledge of Bolivian society
was an invaluable help, not only to my research but also to my well-being. When it
comes to well-being, I am likewise deeply indebted to Trini Betancourt, who took
care for me in La Paz, treated me like her daughter, and sometimes made the
impossible possible. I also owe many thanks to the native speakers of Chipaya. Their
interest in Uchumataqu and unending patience with my questions enabled me to
comprehend Uchumataqu and its relation to Chipaya better than could have done any
book. Without their help, the film Vellard made about the Uru would be nothing but
beautiful pictures.
This is the place to thank my close friends in Bonn: Christiane, Sabine, Moritz,
Christian, and Alexis. They showed the greatest understanding for me and my
sometimes unusual situation. Without them, the years of thesis writing would have
been less happy.
Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my grandparents for
their ever-lasting care and my mother for wanting me to be happy and for picking up
the receiver every time I called.
Any mistake and error this book may contain is entirely mine.

AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY
Uchumataqu, also known as Uru, was spoken around Lake Titicaca in the
communities of Irohito (northwestern Bolivia), Ch'imu (southeastern Peru), and in
the Bay of Puno (Peru) It is assumed that in pre-colomal times there has been an
Uru-speaking population all along the nvers of the Bolivian Altipiano and at the great
lakes Titicaca, Ροορό and Coipasa Wachtel (1986 283) named this stretch the
""aquatic axis"" Adapting to this environment, the Uru based their economy on
hunting, fishing, and gathering However, it is likely that the Uru already became
dispersed under Inca rule and matters did not improve for the Uru population when
the Spanish arrived In fact, they were forced to leave their traditional communities,
abandon their lifestyle and settle down in Aymara villages By this process, the
community of Irohito became isolated and what could be called one of 'the last
stands' of Uru culture and language Despite less favourable social, economic, and
political circumstances, the small village of Irohito managed to survive and even
maintained its language Uchumataqu Although the Uru, their particular culture and
language had been known since early colonial times, they were not documented
before 1894, when Max Uhle paid a visit to Irohito and for the first time collected
linguistic data Irohito soon became a kind of scientific hot spot (Muysken m s
2007 4) and during the first half of the 20th century, the village was visited by a
number of researchers, who recorded Uchumataqu However, a severe drought at the
beginning of the 1940's brought the end to Irohito, and Uchumataqu became extinct
around 1950 However, Irohito recovered and survived as a settlement Today, there
is a certain pnde of the inhabitants about their distinct culture Although the language
has been extinct for about half a century by now and only the knowledge of some
words and phrases remains, the Uru are aware of their ancient language, which, still,
contnbutes to the Urns' view of themselves as being different from all their
neighbours
This study is based on the efforts and results of the early researchers, who
worked in Irohito and on Uchumataqu between 1894 and 1967 Although a
considerable amount of research had been conducted during this time, only few
studies were actually published and none brought together what had been said on
Uchumataqu Therefore, the aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description
of Uchumataqu, taking into consideration every study, published or unpublished, that
is concerned with linguistic data on Uchumataqu It seeks to give an impression of
this language and its phonological, morphological, and syntactic processes and to
provide linguists from different backgrounds with a reference grammar on this so far
minimally described language Working with (in part) historic material on a language
that is not acquired by anyone any more as native language involves a certain degree
of reconstruction and makes necessary more assumptions and incertainties than
would have been the case with a language that is still spoken However, this study is
not a reconstruction in the sense that it tries to reconstruct a proto-language or the
kind of Uchumataqu that was spoken 500 years ago Rather, its purpose is to describe
the language as it has been recorded during the last 50 years of its existence and is2UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAthus a description of a highly endangered language, which, became extinct two
generations ago. It cannot be denied that material from different researchers with
different backgrounds and recorded at different stages of the language, adds new
problems to the already existing challenge of describing a dying language. Thus, in
some cases our knowledge of certain phenomena remains limited since the data do
not provide solutions and there are no native speakers left to answer questions.
To give a more detailed outline of Uchumataqu, its speakers and the research on
which the present study is based, this chapter will sketch the structure of Uchumataqu
and its differences and similarities with closely related Chipaya, before giving an
overview of the Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara influences on this language. That
will be followed by a description of the history of Irohito, its development during the
20th century, and its position at the beginning of the 21 st century, including a sketch
on the field-work I conducted in Irohito. Before turning to detailed presentation of
the sources considered here, I will comment on the theoretical framework applied for
the current study and the resulting terminology and methodology.
This introductory chapter will be followed by a description of the phonology of
Uchumataqu and its morphophonological processes in chapter 2, which I call
context-sensitive processes. Chapter 3 describes the morphological patterns that can
be observed in Uchumataqu. Then I turn to a description of the nominal system in
chapter 4. Chapter 5 concerns a presentation of the verbal system of Uchumataqu.
The following chapter 6 deals with adverbs, postpositions, and the negation particle
ana. The final chapter of this book provides a description of the clause types and
syntactic operations of Uchumataqu. The appendices contain a comparative
dictionary and transcriptions of Uhle's and Lehmann's manuscripts of Uchumataqu.
1.1 Structural overview of the Uchumataqu language
Together with closely related Chipaya (cf. 1.1.2), Uchumataqu forms the language
family of Uru-Chipaya, which is assumed to be isolated (cf. Torero 2002:466,
Muysken 2001:76). The following summary of the linguistic structure of
Uchumataqu is based on my research and the features addressed here will be further
outlined in chapters 2 to 7.
Uchumataqu phonology differs in some aspects from that of the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Just like these languages Uchumataqu has a rather
elaborate set of plosives. However, these include aspirated, glottalised, and labialised
plosives, and word initial plosive clusters, something that cannot be observed for
Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some affricates and fricatives,
which do not occur in its neighbouring languages, either, such as dental voiceless
affricate /ts/ or postalveolar voiceless fricative [J]1. Another distinctive feature of
Uchumataqu phonology is the 5-vowel system with a long variant of each vowel.
However, increasing influence of Aymara (with a 3-vowel system) caused the
attrition of the 5-vowel system, as can be observed in later studies on Uchumataqu
(e.g. Vellard 1967). The tendency of Uchumataqu to allow consonant clusters is also
reflected in its syllable structure, where a syllable can have the form of CVCC orWhich does not have phonemic status.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"(Métraux 1935:100)The word for 'another', cila, is probably related to the numeral ci 'one'. The element
-la has to be considered as lexicalised.(1894:26.2) mentions a plural tsi-naka 'some'. This is the only instance of nominal inflection on a
demonstrative pronoun5 THE VERBAL SYSTEM
In contrast to nouns, verbs do not express time stable concepts but denote actions,
processes, and events. Uchumataqu marks tense, aspect, mood, and grammatical
functions on the verb. According to their semantic content, several kinds of verb
classes can be proposed, such as e.g. motion or action verbs.This may have
consequences for affixation possibilities. Another subcategory in forms according to
which Uchumataqu verbs may be ordered is the distinction between active and stative
verbs. The verb sel- 'to be' functions as a copulative verb.
5.1 Tense marking suffixes
Uchumataqu has a tense system which may be a future / non-future-system although
there are markers for present, past, and future tense. The markers for simple present
and past tense 1 resemble each other more than those for future and simple present
tense (cf. table 5.1). Furthermore, a verb in present457 and past tense can be zero
marked for tense, which is rare for future tense.
It is only for future and simple present tense that a person distinction is made,
i.e. first person singular is marked differently from all other persons which receive
the same marking, habitual present tense, past tense 1 and 2 may be viewed as having
some aspectual notion to them, due to their lack of person marking (see also 5.2.2).
With regard to the distribution of pronominal and clitic elements, the tenses behave
similarly. The two strategies employed most often are either no marking at all or the
use of a subject or subject pronoun. If neither a subject or subject pronoun nor a
subject clitic is used, we must assume that context contributes to person reference.
However, the first person sg is always clearly marked and very often there is double
or triple marking. In this case, a subject clitic is attached to a subject pronoun, and in
present or future tense the verb takes -u or -a, respectively. In general, clitic elements
do not establish person reference by themselves. The tense markers are applied
disregarding verb class.458

4In simple present tense, this is the usual way to express any person other than first person singular
Although future and present tense in Uchumataqu are nearly identical to Chipaya, the varieties differ to
some degree in past tense marking Uchumataqu does not have the Chipaya -ci paradigm, which does not
only express past tense but also person reference and gender distinction Furthermore, Uchumataqu uses
the resultative-/faj in a different manner as well458212UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA5.1.1 Simple present tense -u and 0
In the Uchumataqu simple present tense, the first person singular is obligatorily
marked by -u (1). For second person singular to third person plural no verbal markers
exist, so there we only find the verbal stem (2)460.

do not contain the first person singular marker -u (3) and it is only in entire clauses
that the marker occurs (4). No definite explanation can be given for this, but we may
assume that Vellard wishes to present an infinitive form by deleting the first person

chosen for representation in the present study is either -tni or -tin.
(157)k'utini
'fever (lit.: heat)'(Vellard 1951:22)As has been mentioned above adjectival states do not take nominal or adjectival
marking and thus the question arises on which basis these forms can be termed
'adjectival'. It has been outlined in greater detail in chapter 3.6.2 that their most
important function is to modify nouns. This ability places -tni I -tin marked States
close to prototypical adjectives. Please consider examples (158) and (159).
(158)(159)ana matni tukun wawa
NEG fertile woman
'an infertile woman; a barren woman'(Métraux 1935:90)k'utini luli-cay
warm food-DEC
'it is a warm meal'(Vellard 1950:81)Apart from their functional properties the semantic content of adjectival states further
suggests that it is better to treat them as adjectives. That is, they express a state which
is so permanent or characteristic that it can be understood as a typical property of
somebody or something. A somewhat exceptional case is the expression katni
(Métraux 1935:102) or ka:tin (Vellard 1950:64) 'snow', which does not describe a
property but refers to a noun. It is the only instance where a -tni I -tin marked State is
translated as a noun. However, in all other cases adjectival states refer to properties
and physical properties are encoded as adjectives in Uchumataqu (please recall table
4.17). Therefore, it seems justified to consider adjectival states as a subcategory of
adjectives, although they are not inflected with predicator -kasi.
In contrast to prototypical adjectives, States marked by -tni I -tin at first sight do
not seem to form an open class. What points to a possibly closed class of adjectival
states is that (with one exception) only action and action-process verbs are inflected
with State marking -tni I -tin while other semantic verb classes are not. However,
most expressions carrying -tni I -tin are lexicalised and it is impossible to establish
the underlying verb stem. This observation suggests that derivation of adjectival
states by means of applying -tni I -tin was not productive any more at the time of
documentation, which may further explain the relatively small number of actual
instances found and repeated citations of the same form. Thus, I would like to ascribe
the small set of items and the restricted applicability of -tni I -tin to a lexicalisation
process completed before the first documentation rather than to adjectival states
forming a closed class.
4.4 The numeral system
The Uchumataqu numeral system is a decimal one, as is shown in the way of
building numbers higher than ten. Numbers up to 99 are built on the base of qhalo
'ten'. In Uchumataqu we find the following numerals:UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA208(160)ci

'10(Muysken 2005:36)Cardinal numbers higher than ten are built as possessor-possessed constructions
where possessive -ci marks possession on the possessed (cf. 4.1.2.1).
The numbers 11-19 are built with qhalo as possessor with the digit in the
function of the possessed. Here we find the following order: ten-digit-POS(-POS).
(161)kalu

'thirty-two'(Vellard 1951:18)Possessive -ci is attached only to digits, ie: 11-19, 21-29, etc 452 . Constructions as
(163) can be understood as a possessive structure with the digit being possessed and
inflected with -ci. However, possessive -ci is not attached to 20, 30, 40, etc (example
162). These are built in the way of digit-ten without taking possessive -ci.
Cardinal numbers 200 to 900 are built in the way of: digit-hundred, without
possessive -ci (164). One hundred itself is expressed as qhalo qhalo (lit: 'ten ten') or
with the Aymara ioanpataka.
(164)konko pataka
eight hundred
'eight hundred'(Vellard 1951:19)Numbers from 101 to 199 etc. are built in the following way: hundred-digit(-ten)(POS).","[223, 224, 225]"
"228UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAIt is only in Lehmann's data from Ch'imu (1929) that the object marker appears in
the form of is- (cf. 62, 63); for Ancoaqui Lehmann reports s-, too. This points to a
possible dialectal split between the Bolivian variety of Irohito and the Peruvian
language community of Ch'imu.
5.4.2 Subject marker -s
The verbal subject marker (su) -s can be regarded as a counterpart to object marker sin that it marks a first person as subject and as such the form -s belongs to the affixes
marking grammatical functions. In contrast to the object marker, subject marker -s
regularly marks both first person singular and plural as subject. It is directly attached
to the verb stem and is often followed by object marker -n and the marker of first
person singular -u. It is only in its frequent combination with the marker -n that
subject marker -s is followed by first person singular future marker -a, but no
instance is found where -s alone is followed by -a. I have no explanation for this, but
it seems unlikely that subject marker -s should be restricted to past or present tense.
The subject marker -s alone appears only a few times in my data (64), but it
occurs regularly in combination with the object marker -n (65, 66).

majority of predicative clauses word order is as indicated in (87).

"239CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM5.7.3 Chain verb constructions
What may be understood as a kind of subcategory to subordination are the so-called
chain verb constructions (cf. Muysken 2001:108). The matrix verb is often the
volition verb pek- 'to want' and the complement verb is zero marked, i.e. it consists
of the verb stem alone. Although two different actions (e.g. 'want' and 'eat') are
expressed, these are closely related, as can also be seen by word order, where the
complement verb immediately precedes the matrix verb (cf. chapter 7.8.2).

(Métraux 1935:90)If at all, chain verb constructions come closest to what could be described as
coreferential and non-simultaneous, although there are counterexamples such as

NEG-CL=1 lift can-lSG

('/'/ ne peut se lever')(Métraux 1935:99)With respect to verb class, we find chain verb constructions involving action,
cognition, utterance, and motion verbs537. Although the database is limited, we may
assume that there is no restriction with regard to verb class. As in simple declarative
clauses, person reference is expressed mainly by the use of a subject or subject
pronoun, the latter one is frequently inflected with a subject clitic (cf. 99 and 100).
5.8 Mood and modality
The terms mood and modality have been extensively discussed in the literature and
the resulting definitions reflect the various approaches to this topic. A detailed
discussion of the terms is beyond the scope of this section and in what follows, I rely
on Foley and Van Valin (1984) as cited in Bybee (1985).
Mood is understood by Bybee as 'a marker on the verb that signals how the
speaker chooses to put the proposition into the discourse context.' (1985:165), i.e. the
speaker makes a statement on his / her view of the predication. According to this
definition, mood is subdivided by Bybee into ""illocutionary force"" and ""commitment
to the truth of the assertion"" (1985:170), the first subgroup consisting of imperative,
Optative, Admonitive, Prohibitive, and Interrogative, the latter of Subjunctive,
Dubitative, Probable, Potential, and Conditional. If this definition is applied to53maska 'pot' is a loan from Quechua
putti- is a loan from Spanish puedo 'I can'. The ending -u is interpreted as Uchumataqu first person
singular.
537
In one example the adjective kewa 'fat' is used as a verb, in the sense of 'to get fat'
536UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA240Uchumataqu and the inflection with declarative marker -cay is chosen as a criterion

—
+Table 5.4: Mood, speech act type, and inflection with declarative -cayWe find that those speech act types labelled by Bybee as ""illocutionary force"" (ibid.)
cannot take declarative -cay, whereas those which express the speaker's commitment
can take the marker as can any basic declarative clause. Thus, the proposition made
by Bybee (on the basis of Foley and Van Valin 1984) is valid for Uchumataqu, too,
and accordingly, the speech act types treated in the following sections (imperative,
Optative, Potential, Conditional, and the so-called future irrealis) are viewed as mood
categories.
A term not yet mentioned is deontic and Foley and Van Valin (1984:214) and
Bybee (1985:166) agree on that it belongs to the category of modality but not to
mood since deontic modalities always refer to the agent of the predication and not to
the speaker. Thus, the categories of mood and modality in Uchumataqu can be
sketched as follows:/\Mood (speaker related)illocutionary force

"2 PHONOLOGY
In the following sections I will describe the phonological system of Uchumataqu as
well as the context-sensitive processes observed in the language. A final section will
deal with the syllable and stress patterns of Uchumataqu and the spelling conventions
used in subsequent chapters.
2.1 Sources and background information
For the temporal frame chosen for the current study, no recorded material is
available135 and therefore, a phonological description of Uchumataqu necessarily has
to rely on written material. This material consists of the following works: Uhle
(1894), manuscript; Polo (1901), published word list; Lehmann (1929), manuscripts;
Métraux (1935), published word list with entire clauses; Vellard (1949-67), published
word lists, clauses, and entire conversations136. There is considerable variation among
the sources: Uhle, Lehmann, and Vellard use different phonetic transcription systems
in their works, whereas Polo employs mainly the Spanish alphabet and Métraux has a
somewhat simplicised phonetic transcription137. Thus, Uhle, Lehmann, and Vellard
offer a detailed phonological description of Uchumataqu with several diacritics to
further specify a certain sound, while Polo and Métraux are less detailed. Although
all authors provide a short explanation as to which transcription system they employ
or what a certain symbol means, these explanations are by no means exhaustive nor
do they cover all the symbols actually used in a transcription, or are sometimes even
contradictory. Furthermore, Uhle, Lehmann, and Vellard do not use the same
transcription systems in their works. Obviously because Uhle and Lehmann are from
a German tradition and Vellard is from a French school. Thus, I had to rely in part on
external sources in order to interpret and analyse sounds and symbols not described
by the authors themselves. These external sources are Schmidt, Die Sprachlaute und
ihre Darstellung in einem allgemeinen linguistischen Alphabet (1907), who gives a
broad and detailed overview of the European transcription conventions used at this
time. This proves particularly valuable for an analysis of Uhle's and Lehmann's data.
For Lehmann's manuscripts, I also rely on one of his earlier publications, Die
Sprachen Zentral-Amerikas in ihren Beziehungen zueinander sowie zu Süd-Amerika
und Mexiko (1920), where Lehmann provides an explanation of the sounds and
symbols used in transcription, which are also found in his manuscripts from 1929. As
mentioned by Bacaueza in Proyecto de alfabeto para Escribir la Lengua Aymara
([1910] 1957), Uhle was among those scholars who put forward an Aymara alphabet
and it is likely that he used a similar transcription in his manuscript (1894) of the
Uchumataqu language. The French transcription tradition is covered by Meillet and
135
The film about the Uru made by Vellard (1951, cf 14 2 5 3) actually contains audio material on
Uchumataqu However, the quality of the material is such that it s not suitable for a phonological analysis
Furthermore, the audio material in the film is rather limited and it is doubtful whether it would be
sufficient for a phonological analysis
""""Bacarreza ([1910] 1957), Posnansky (1934), LaBarre (1941), and Palavecino (1949) are considered
only to a minor degree since they provide mainly ethnographic information with only a few words in their
texts The transcription system used by them is that of Polo, i.e. it resembles the Spanish alphabet
137
According to the author, it is based on Rivet and Crequi-Montfort (1925-27)UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA58Cohen, Les Langues du monde (1952), where the authors provide a comprehensive
insight into the relevant French transcription conventions. The modem International
Phonetic Alphabet (IPA, as presented in Clark and Yallop 1995; 1996) is only
considered when it gives further support to a statement based on the sources
mentioned above. The same is true for Cerrón-Palomino's grammar of Chipaya, El
chipaya o la lengua de los hombres del agua (2006).
The contribution of the external sources to the analysis and interpretation of the
symbols used in the manuscripts is as follows: Although Lehmann does not classify
e.g. <r> in his manuscripts, he defines an identical symbol as a prepalatal dental in
his work from 1920. Since Lehmann uses almost identical transcription systems in
both studies, we may assume that the description from 1920 also applies to the
symbol used in the manuscript from 1929. In other cases, more interpretation is
required. The symbol <]> as used by Vellard (1949-67) is not explained by the
researcher himself, but a definition of an identical symbol is found in Meillet and
Cohen (1952:xiii), where it is described as a prepalatal lateral. The symbol <]>
occurs in the same word (xil'i 'meat') as the symbol <Γ>, which is used by Métraux
(1935) and classified as ""[...] the «11» or palatalised 1 of the same language [i.e.
Spanish].""138 (translation mine). Thus, we know that a) <]> represents a prepalatal
lateral and b) that it can be equated with Métraux's symbol <Γ>, which characterises
<11>. On the basis of these considerations it is possible to say that Vellard's symbol
<1> corresponds to what in modem Spanish ortography is represented by <11>. Thus,
when <]> is defined as a prepalatal or palatal lateral, the interpretation is mine and
not provided by Vellard himself. It is thus important to point out that the general
interpretation of symbols is mine unless indicated otherwise.
2.1. J Minimal pairs
The different background of the sources gives rise to an analytical problem: there
does not seem to be a single word transcribed the same way in all sources. To
exemplify this statement, an overview is given in table 2.1 of the differing
transcriptions used for 'water', an item central to the Uchumataqu language and thus,
139
present in almost every source .

make it almost impossible to determine whether 'water' actually starts with a uvular

or labialised. Variation does not only occur between two (or more) sources but also
""le «II» ou I mouillé de la même language.""
Neither Posnansky (1934) nor LaBarre (1941) or Palavecino (1949) list the word for 'water'
Lehmann (1929b) refers to his manuscript from Ancoaqui, Lehmann ( 1929d) to the one from Ch'imuCHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY59within one source, i.e. the sources are not entirely consistent with respect to
transcription. This makes it virtually impossible to work with minimal pairs and thus,
I do not use the notion of minimal pair in order to establish phonemes of
Uchumataqu. Rather, I decide to take as phonemes those sounds that occur in every
or almost every source. I allow for some variation with respect to Polo, who uses a
kind of Spanish alphabet and does not represent e.g. a postalveolar voiceless fricative
[I] which, on the other hand, is present in every other work. Thus, a sound must occur
in the majority of the sources in order to be treated as a phoneme. However, if its use
suggests allophonic rather than phonemic status, this is discussed in the relevant
section.
Every section starts with a description of those sounds I regard as phonemes,
followed by a description of non-phonemic sounds. Phonemes are represented as e.g.
/a/, whereas non-phonemic sounds occur in brackets [ä]. Symbols are represented as
e.g. <â>. The headlines of sections dealing with phonemes are bold whereas sections
on non-phonemic sounds are plain. However, it is important to keep in mind that the
distinction between phonemes and non-phonemes, as proposed in the current study,
remains tentative, given that fieldwork and recording of speech is no longer possible.
Thus, the background to the sources leads to a considerable amount of variation and
in some cases, the interpretations are even contradictory.
2.7.2 Spelling
In section titles and in the text, I represent sounds by their current IPA symbol, e.g. a
post-alveolar fricative is transcribed in all sources as <s> but represented in section
titles as [ƒ]. In cases where the corresponding IPA symbol cannt be established, the
symbol found in the sources is maintained, e.g. <0>. For the examples quoted from
the sources, I maintained the spelling used there. This leads to a certain confusion
and sometimes even to contradictions caused by the diverging transcriptions for one
and the same word. In some cases, I simplified the transcription somewhat in order to
focus on a relevant feature. This is particularly the case when the status of the deleted
feature is considered uncertain, as e.g. vowel length where we find a considerable
amount of variation and even contradictions.
With respect to positions, I propose the following possibilities: a sound can
occur word initially and/or finally and within a word in a syllable onset and / or coda
thereby taking a pre- and/or post-consonantal or intervocalic position. By 'syllable
onset' I refer to a non-initial syllable onset, i.e. a syllable onset within a word,
whereas a syllable onset appearing at the beginning of a word is labeled word initial.
A single dot marks a syllable break (.).
2.1.3 Consonant phonemes of Uchumataqu
Given above considerations, I propose the following phonemes for Uchumataqu.","[73, 74, 75, 76]"
"(Uhle 1894:92.2)The verb stem of 'to say' is ki-, so one may expect the imperative to consist of kialone. However, the form given by Uhle (ibid.) is ki-a where one vowel is followed
by another one. In most cases, the rule (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:85) V1+V2 = V2 is
applicable (cf. 2.12.1) but in this case it is not. This may be due to the fact that if the
rule was applied the resulting form would be *ka- with the stem vowel deleted. Thus,
in order to maintain the stem vowel, the rule is not applied and the resulting form
proves that the imperative is built by the verb stem plus imperative marker -a.
Other examples suggest that the object marker -n is inserted before imperative
-a, which would be impossible if the imperative was built with the verb stem alone.

7.7.4 Possessive predicate clauses
The next type to be discussed are possessive predicate clauses. Benefactive -taki (on
the possessor) and possessive -ci (on the possessed) occur with this type of
predication. Here, the predicate is often inflected with declarative -cay.

"(Uhle 1894:92.2)The elision of the final stem vowel caused by inflection often makes it necessary to
reconstruct it.
Only in interrogative and subordinate clauses, as well as in chain verb
constructions do verbs appear in the shape of their stem (see also sections 5.7.3, 7.6,
and 7.8.2). Nominal stems, on the other hand, can occur without marking, as is
frequently the case with subjects and direct objects, which are only optionally marked
by topic marker -ki. The same situation is found with adjectival and adverbial stems,
particularly in attributive function, where they are often zero marked (cf. 3.2).
However, both verbal and nominal stems form the basis for further inflectional
and derivational processes, as shown in the following examples (stems bold).

that e.g. yafsij-kasi (example 9) is construed of one single word and not of two, such
as *ya[si]ka si. As the discussion of phonology (chapter 2) has shown, phonological
criteria are a less reliable means for establishing word boundaries and thus, I will
adopt a syntactic definition of the term 'word', as provided by Anderson (1985:153):
""The units which can thus be permuted or interrupted freely by other 'words' can
therefore be taken to establish a syntactic notion of ""word."". Examples (10) and (11)

"42UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAof Métraux's field trip (Métraux 1935:75, 76). The introduction is followed by a
detailed ethnographical description concerning the material culture: house types,
household goods, and tools as well as notes on the economic situation (hunting,
fishing, agriculture, livestock and cattle) (Métraux 1935:76-84). The following part
deals with the several uses of totora reeds, used for building rafts, plaits, and ropes
(Métraux 1935:84-86). A final section describes the clothing of the Uru (Métraux
1935:86f). On the next few pages Métraux (1935:87-89) is concerned with the social
and religious organisation of the Uru and also adds a brief section on their
""character"". The word list is preceded by some basic notes on the linguistic situation,
including a very brief comment on the phonological transcription system used (cf.
chapter 2). Métraux (1935:89) observes that the Uru would not use their ancient
language any more but spoke Aymara even among themselves. A somewhat
contradictory statement is that Métraux considered Uchumataqu to be ""purer""99 than
closely related Chipaya, which he explained by the fact that Ancoaqui and Irohito are
geographically close to important Uru centres of Lake Titicaca (ibid.). Métraux
supplies photos of Uchumataqu speakers and detailed drawings on tools and
household goods throughout his ethnographic description.
The word list itself (Métraux 1935:90-110) is French-Uru and ordered
alphabetically. It contains 631 lexical items of all word classes, i.e. verbs from every
class, adjectives, adverbs of time, manner and degree as well as nouns. The latter
cover all possible semantic fields, as there are: body parts, kinship terms, clothing,
food, illness, tools and appliances, balsa rafts, domesticated and non-domesticated
animals as well as natural and astronomical phenomena. Métraux also provides
personal and interrogative pronouns, directional adverbs, short phrases of everyday
life, and numerals 1 to 23, 100, 1.000 and 10.000. However, Métraux made only very
basic grammatical observations, such as that e.g. -kin is a suffix meaning 'to, toward'
(Métraux 1935:109).
Apart from a mere word list Métraux provides almost 200 additional explicative
clauses to the majority of his lexical data. These clauses and phrases aim to show the
use of a certain item in various contexts, e.g. in interrogative or imperative clauses.
Thus, we find eighteen clauses exemplifying the use of the verb 'to go'. Example
clauses occur with several kinds of lexemes, but particularly with the following
verbs: 'to have'100; 'to kill'; 'to hit, beat'; 'to come'; 'to put'; 'to see'; 'to make'; 'to
want'; 'to eat'; 'to leave'. The interrogative pronoun 'who?' is likewise explained in
greater detail. The example clauses are of varying length and complexity.
Métraux's work is primarily a word list, which may be the reason why it has not
been considered for subsequent publications on Uchumataqu. That is, neither
LaBarre (1941), Palavecino (1949) nor Vellard (1949-67) mention it as a source of
their works and recent studies (e.g. Torero 2002) refer only to Uhle ( 1894), Lehmann
(1929), or Vellard but neglect Métraux's word list. Although Métraux's study on
Uchumataqu has always been underestimated, it contains highly valuable linguistic
99Métraux does not explain what he means by ""purer"", but we may assume that it implies that
Uchumataqu was less influenced by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish than Chipaya
100
The notion of 'to have' is expressed by a construction involving benefactive -fail and the copulative
verb sel- 'to be'CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION43(and ethnographic) information. As already mentioned above, his language
consultants must have been ftilly competent native speakers of Uchumataqu, to which
the complexity of several of the example clause points. Not only is the old
pronominal plural marker -wici present in Métraux's data, Métraux is, apart from
Uhle, the only researcher to report vocalisation (cf. 2.12.1.2). Almost all grammatical
interpretations obtained by an analysis of Métraux's example clauses are congruent
with Uhle's findings and can be verified by them. The lexical material provided by
Métraux agrees to a high proportion with the lexical data given by e.g. Lehmann
(1929b). It is a general observation that there is a gap between material recorded
before 1931 and material recorded after this time. This gap is found in the lexicon but
to a the larger degree it occurs with grammatical morphemes. That is, certain features
present in the documents from 1894 to 1935 are not found in Vellard's work, while
Vellard reports characteristics that seem to be of recent origin, since neither Uhle
(1894), Lehmann (1929), or Métraux (1935) mentions them.
To conclude, I regard Métraux's material to be highly reliable and informative.
Together with Uhle's manuscript Métraux's data form 'core information' on
Uchumataqu. However, as other works of his time, Métraux's article shows the same
lack of information on his language consultants, languages used during the recording
process, and the general circumstances of his field-work. Furthermore, the time he
spent in Ancoaqui was rather short and he did not pay a second visit. From a presentday point of view, this can be considered a significant failure in the process of data
collection.
1.4.2.5 Jehan (Jean) A. Vellard (1901-1996)
Jehan Albert Vellard was bom in Béja, Tunesia, in 1901101 (Dollfus 1996:165) and
between 1940 and 1943 he was director of the National Museum in La Paz (Dollfus
1996:166). During this time he collected part of his data on Uchumataqu presented
below. Vellard's anthropological interest made him a lecturer for social anthropology
at the University of San Marcos and the Catholic University in Lima102. Finally,
Vellard also founded the Institut français d'Études andines (Dollfus 1996:166). He
died in Argentina in 1996 (Dollfus 1996:167).
Vellard is the only researcher ever to have carried out intensive field-work on
the Uru and correspondingly, he presents abundant material on ethnography and
linguistics. Between 1938 and 1952 he visited Irohito several times (see tab. 1.4),
although he possibly did not collect linguistic data on every visit. Vellard is also the
only researcher to present background information on his language consultants and
1
' As other researchers introduced in this section, he did not study social anthropology or linguistics, but
instead received a degree in medicine at the age of 24 (ibid.) However, the stations of his career are quite
diverse and include the position of an assistant at the Butantan Institute in Sâo Paulo between 1925 and
1929, the employment at the Museum of Natural History in Paraguay (1930-1932), the position of head of
department for immunology in Fernambuco and head of the zoological department at the University of
Tucumân.
102
Apart from having worked in the Andean region, Vellard also travelled widely around and visited e g
the Chaco region, Paraguay, Bolivia, as well as the Nambikwara and Bororo populations in Brazil On
these latter journeys he was accompanied by structuralist Claude Lévi-Strauss (Dollfus 1996:165). We
may assume that Vellard was very proficient in both Spanish and Portuguese.","[58, 59, 60]"
"(Uhle 1894:23,49)In most cases, however, adverbs are zero marked (cf. 3.2) and furthermore, they lack
characteristics prototypical nouns possess, i.e. adverbs do not usually function as the
head of phrases319, nor can they be subject or object of a clause. An adverb can be
modified by another adverb, but these cases are rare. That is, although adverbs of
time, direction, and location share some structural properties with nouns, they lack
most of the functional characteristics of nouns. However, based on the morphological
behaviour of adverbs, i.e. their ability to take nominal case markers, I classify them
as a subcategory of nouns320. For further discussion on adverbs, cf. chapter 6.
In conclusion, what sets Uchumataqu nouns apart from other grammatical
categories is their ability to function as the head of noun phrases, topics of texts, and
subjects of clauses. Furthermore, they take a broad range of modifiers and can be
characterised by the application of the distinctive possessive pronoun of first person
singular wist 'my'. However, nouns can be used as predicates without distinctive
marking and thus, occupy a role usually reserved for verbs. In sum, nouns in
Uchumataqu can be classified on the basis of some criteria but the distinction
between them and other parts-of-speech, particularly verbs, is not clear-cut in every
aspect.",[169]
"36UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAAs part of Lehmann's academic legacy the manuscripts are in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. They have not been published77.
In the following description I will only discuss the fair copies of the
manuscripts78, i.e. the description excludes the original manuscript from Ch'imu. The
contents of the original manuscript and the fair copy from Ch'imu are mainly
identical but legibility of the fair copy is by far better. The only aspect in which the
fair copy differs from the original manuscript is that in the latter Lehmann provides
the names of his language consultants for each entry and gives a description of the
demographical situation. Furthermore, in the fair copy Lehmann combines the
numerals reported by his different language consultants: numerals 1 to 4 and 40 are
from one speaker, the numbers 5 to 10 and 20 from another. Apart from these
differences, both manuscripts are identical with respect to their linguistic content. I
will treat the manuscripts in their chronological order.
1.4.2.3.1 Manuscript from Ancoaqui (fair copy)
As Lehmann states in the fair copy, he visited Ancoaqui on October 12th 1929 and
made the fair copy the following day in La Paz, which means he spent only one day
in the community79. The fair copy consists of 26 pages80 with 453 entries, which are
mainly lexical. Until p. 21 Lehmann provides only nouns and adjectives, which cover
several semantic fields. It is noteworthy that the nouns refer mainly to concrete
objects, such as e.g. 'house', 'broom', 'knee', etc., although Lehmann also reports
kinship terms, such as 'brother-/sister-in-law' and some terms designating religious
phenomena, such as 'soul'. These purely lexical entries are followed on pages 21 and
22 by the numerals 1 to 10, 20 and 100, the personal pronouns, and a possessive
paradigm exemplified by the word 'house'. On pages 23 and 24 Lehmann presents
the drawing of a traditional Andean loom and ten Uchumataqu terms referring to its
parts. It is only on the last two pages (p. 25, 26) of his manuscript that Lehmann
gives some grammatical information. This consists of conjugations of the verbs 'to
be' and 'to give' and although the latter is supposed to be transitive, we find no
object expressed, i.e. Lehmann asked for 'I give', 'you give' and so on. He also
presents the forms 'I was', 'I am not', and 'I was not', which are single entries
without full paradigms. Page 25 also contains what appears to be a repetition of the
possessive paradigm presented on p. 22. On the last page Lehmann supplies the
intransitive form 'I die' and four examples of the transitive verb 'to kill': 'I kill you',
'you kill me', 'he kills me', and 'I kill him'.
The following unnumbered page shows Lehmann's hypothesis about a possible
genetic relationship between Uchumataqu and Atacameno81 and correspondingly, he
presents a comparative word list of 46 lexemes of these two languages on another
two pages (A and B). On the following two pages (a and ß) Lehmann comparesI am very grateful to the Ibero-Amenkamsches Institut for having allowed me access to the legacies of
both Max Uhle and Walter Lehmann
™ However, for Ancoaqui there is no other possibility since I had access only to the fair copy
79
As Dürr (1993174) points out this was Lehmann's common way to collect data.
80
Lehmann starts numbering on the first page of the word list. The introductory pages are not numbered
"" A consideration also mentioned by PoloCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION37Uchumataqu with Mochica but points out that it has to be considered a ""preliminary
attempt""82 (Lehmann 1929b, a, translation mine). This list consists of 26 lexical items
as well as the numerals 5 and 6. Lehmann does not mention his sources for the
Atacameno and Mochica terms but the Uchumataqu terms must be from Ancoaqui
since Lehmann produced the list on October 13th 1929 in La Paz, i.e. two weeks
before he visited Ch'imu. However, he must have returned later to this material since
the lists are followed by a final remark, in which Lehmann explains that further
research on the Puquina texts of Ore is required to clarify the linguistic situation at
the northern coast of Peru. The note is dated April 24th 1931.
Lehmann uses Spanish in his manuscript with the exception of the introduction
and the description of the loom and its parts. However, Lehmann did not speak
Quechua or Aymara, as becomes apparent in the introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript (Lehmann 1929d:ii)83. Since the Uchumataqu speakers did not understand
Spanish, Lehmann needed an interpreter to communicate with them (Lehmann
1929b:i)8'1. He describes the interview situation as follows: ""Using my synoptical
word lists the conversation with the Uru was pursued by the interpreter in Spanish,
Aymara, and Quechua.""85 (Lehmann 1929b:i). The interpreter (Lehmann 1929d:ii)86
is described as speaking not only Spanish but also Aymara and Quechua fluently.
However, some confusion arises with respect to the names and numbers of
interpreters actually involved. As Lehmann mentions on the first page to the
Ancoaqui manuscript (and repeats in the more detailed introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript) he was accompanied by only one interpreter, but on the second page he
gives the names of two men he refers to as interpreters: Chunak kasi and Mariano
Kispe87. However, on p. 23 / 43488 Lehmann declares Suma Ch'ufiak kasi to be the
alleged name of his main language consultant. Lehmann does not further clarify the
situation of interpreters and language consultants involved, but I suppose that there
has been a misunderstanding since cuna-kasi is an Uchumataqu expression meaning
'it is well' or in the case of suma cuna-kasi 'it is very well'89. It is thus probable that
Lehmann interpreted as a name what in fact was only an agreement uttered by one of
his consultants. Lehmann himself seems to have mistrusted the statement of his
language consultant as he refers to it as the alleged name. Apart from these not
entirely clear notes Lehmann does not provide further specifications on his language
consultants or interpreter and their personal backgrounds. However, since Lehmann
refers to Chunak kasi as his ""main informant"" we may assume that other persons
were involved too. We do not know what kind of relationship there was between

Ancoaqui it further seems doubtful whether there was any particular relationship at
all. However, according to Lehmann the Uchumataqu speakers were sympathetic
about the interview situation and encouraged him to learn their language. This
remained his only visit.
Taking this into consideration as well as the fact that most of Lehmann's data
are lexical, we find them less suitable for a grammatical description. However, when
compared to other sources, the vast majority of Lehmann's lexemes can be verified,
which is also true for his basic grammatical observations. As Uhle and Polo,
Lehmann visited Ancoaqui at a time when fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu were apparently still alive. This is reflected in his data, which contain
elements that cannot be found in later documents, e.g. the pronominal plural marker wici. Thus, the data provided by Lehmann can be judged reliable but less appropriate
for a grammatical description since they are mainly lexical.
1.4.2.3.2 Manuscript from Ch'imu (fair copy)
In contrast to the preceding manuscript, Lehmann supplies more detailed background
information in the manuscript from Ch'imu and also refers to his visit to Ancoaqui.
He visited Ch'imu on 26lh October 1929 where he met Florentino Valcufia, an elderly
fisherman who lived in the village. According to Lehmann's description, he started
working with Florentino Valcufia on the spot and collected a few hundred words.
When Florentino's son Nicolas Valcufia, alcalde90 of Ch'imu, appeared Lehmann
persuaded Nicolas to accompany him to Puno. They kept working at Lehmann's
hotel in Puno but Nicolas Valcufia returned to Ch'imu the same night. Although
Lehmann mentions her in the manuscript, the marniti Juanita Cuno did not
contribute to the data collection. Again, Lehmann spent only one afternoon in the Uni
community and did not return for further interviews. However, it is noteworthy that
Lehmann was the only researcher ever to have visited Ch'imu for the purpose of
collecting linguistic data. As such, his manuscript from Ch'imu can be regarded as
unique.
Lehmann's interpreter was Enrique Rodriguez Averanta, as is stated in the
original manuscript92; in the fair copy Lehmann (1929d:iii)93 only mentions that the
interpreter is a ""known poet"". He spoke Aymara with the Valcufia family and the
languages thus used in data recording were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu.
Lehmann made the fair copy in his hotel in La Paz (date unspecified) and on
board the ship back to Europe. The date given here is January 30th 1930, i.e. about
three months after his trip to Ch'imu. Like in the Ancoaqui manuscript Lehmann uses
Spanish, again with the exception of the introduction and some terms of which he
possibly did not know the Spanish name.
The manuscript from Ch'imu is slightly shorter than the one from Ancoaqui and
consists of 29 pages with 324 entries. Until p. 14 / 188 the word list is ordered

Numbering mineCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION39alphabetically and contains mainly the same items as the Ancoaqui list, i.e. mainly
concrete nouns referring to body parts, clothing and such. On the following five
pages, Lehmann provides directions, temporal adverbs and expressions as well as
conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to eat' and a possessive paradigm for the word
'house'. Numerals 1 to 10, 20, and 40 are provided on p. 19 to be followed by further
lexical entries, which do not belong to a particular semantic field but comprise only
nouns. Page 24 / 273 contains another example of a possessive paradigm of 'house',
which, however, is note complete since second and third person plural are missing.
Lehmann supplies purely lexical information on the following pages, but on pp. 27
and 28 adds conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to give', again providing single
entries on 'I am not', 'I was', and 'I was not'. The verb 'to give' is used as an
example of a transitive verb. Lehmann repeats the drawing of the traditional loom
from Ancoaqui but this time lists thirteen items designating its parts. The headline
clearly states that the drawing was made two weeks earlier in Ancoaqui, so it is likely
that Lehmann used the older drawing in the absence of a real loom to collect some
more terms with Nicolas Valcuna. Most of these are German, probably because
Lehmann did not have the appropriate Spanish word at hand.
According to a final note, Lehmann wrote the introduction on March δ""1 1937 in
Berlin, i.e. almost eight years after his trip to Ancoaqui and Ch'imu.
As mentioned above, Lehmann notes which data were contributed by Florentino
or Nicolas Valcuna. It is noteworthy that the items provided by Florentino Valcufla
show a higher degree of Aymara influence than do those of his son Nicolas. This is
particularly the case with numerals and possessive paradigms. Florentino counts in
Uchumataqu until 4 but changes to Aymara then, while Nicolas gives all the
numerals in Uchumataqu. A similar observation concerns the possessive paradigms:
the one provided by Florentino is incomplete (see above) and it shows considerable
influence from Aymara due to the suffixed endings -ma and -pa. The paradigm given
by Nicolas is complete and is close to what other sources report as possession
marking, although Nicolas gives anxat as the pronoun of third person singular, which
cannot be confirmed by other sources. We find the following distribution of the data:
in more concrete fields, such as e.g. the making of balsa rafts, food, and animals,
most of the data were provided by Florentino Valcuna, whereas more abstract terms,
such as temporal adverbs, directions and all grammatical items were contributed by
his son Nicolas. As to the reason, we can only speculate. It is possible that Lehmann
found Nicolas a more suitable language consultant on Uchumataqu than his father.
With respect to how the data were collected, the manuscript from Ch'imu is
restricted by the same considerations as is the one from Ancoaqui, although Lehmann
supplies information about his language consultants. An evaluation of the linguistic
data is hardly possible due to the following reasons. First, the items provided by
Florentino Valcuna are to a certain degree influenced by Aymara, and his command
of Uchumataqu seems to have been weaker than that of his son. Second, since
Lehmann is the only person ever to have collected data in Ch'imu, a comparison with
the remaining sources, all on Ancoaqui, would not yield reliable results. Differences
can be ascribed to a higher degree of language attrition in Ch'imu and / or to dialectal
variation. Since there is no further material on Ch'imu, the question for dialectal40UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAvariation has to remain unanswered. What can be said is that even in those cases
where a Ch'imu word is close to its Ancoaqui equivalent, we almost always find
slight differences. In other cases, in particular in the verbal paradigms, the data
cannot be verified at all, i.e. they are neither Uchumataqu nor e.g. Aymara. This is
the case with e.g. anxata inarata (Lehmann 1929d:17), which is translated as 'he
eats' but inarata is neither Uchumataqu nor Aymara nor Quechua (for anxata see
above). Thus, data from the Ch'imu manuscript will be used only when they can be
verified by other sources on Ancoaqui.
1.4.2.3.3 Comparative word list (fair copy)
Finally, I will present the comparative word list. It does not contain new data, since it
is based on the word lists from Ancoaqui and Ch'imu. Furthermore, it contributes
only in a few cases to the grammatical description of the current work. I will thus
provide only a brief description.
The manuscript is preceded by a short introduction, where Lehmann repeats the
background information given in the Ancoaqui and Ch'imu manuscripts. A final note
says the fair copy was made in Chile in November 1929, but it is uncertain whether it
refers to the fair copy of the Ch'imu manuscript or the comparative word list.
The word list comprises three parts, of which the most comprehensive one is the
comparison itself. It consists of 32 pages with three columns each: the first contains
the Spanish entry, while the second one shows the corresponding Uchumataqu term
from Ch'imu and the last column the Uchumataqu expression from Ancoaqui.
Lehmann compares nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and numerals as well as grammatical
observations. On p. 8 he provides a comparison of numerals 1 to 10 of historical
Puquina (quoting Ore 1607) with his own data from Ancoaqui and Ch'imu94, and
Mochica, providing the name of Efa Isidora Isique, which remains unexplained. The
last two pages (unnumbered) of the manuscript show a comparison of numerals from
Chipaya95 with those from Atacameno. The comparison comprises the numerals 1 to
10 and 20 but the Chipaya numerals are complete only until 4. There are three notes
that refer to this comparative list of numerals: the first states that the comparison of
numerals was made on April 25,h 1931, the second dates from 1936. There, Lehmann
points out that he did not find Posnansky's material to be reliable but that he had
come across new words in Métraux's publication in the Journal de la Société des
Americanistes (Métraux 1936). Finally, Lehmann proposes that what he calls UruChipaya-Puquina must be related to Atacameno and Mochica but points to the less
satisfying situation of sources on Atacameno and Mochica, which have prevented a
more detailed investigation. This note is dated March 8th 1937.
The last page contains another comparison of numerals 1 to 10 and 20,
comparing Puquina, Uru-Chipaya, two proto-languages96, Mochica, and Atacameno.
Lehmann found all these languages related and suggested that they must originate in9' Apparently using the numerals provided by Nicolas, although the heading says otherwise.
Lehmann quotes Posnansky La lengua ""chipaya"" 1915.

Lehmann does not fürther specify whether these proto-languages refer to Proto-Uru-Chipaya or any
other proto-language.

April 25lh 1931.
1.4.2.4 Alfred Métraux (1902-1963)
The Swiss scholar Alfred Métraux was bom in Lausanne on November 5' 1902 and
in 1922 began his studies at the École des Chartes, the Sorbonne, and the École
Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris97 (Sachot 2007:61). In 1928 Métraux went to
Argentina, where he founded the Ethnological Institute at the University of Tucumân,
of which he was director for the following six years (d'Ans 1978:19f; Monnier
2003:9-14; Wagley 1964:603f; quoted in: Sachot 2007:61). He went on field-work
trips to the Chaco region. Northwest Argentina, and the Bolivian Altipiano. The data
on Uchumataqu (as well as on Chipaya) were collected during these years98. Alfred
Métraux committed suicide in Paris on April 11th 1963 (Sachot 2007:63).
As other researchers of the late 19th and first half of the 20lh century, Métraux is
not very detailed about the background information of his field-work. That is, there is
no comment on whether Métraux employed an interpreter or which languages were
used in the process of data collection. However, as Sachot (2007:64) points out
Métraux was accompanied by an Aymara speaking interpreter when visiting the
community of Chipaya and we may therefore assume that he also had an interpreter
with him when studying Uchumataqu. It is also likely that the languages used during
the interviews were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu. It remains likewise unkown
with whom Métraux collected his data and the only note made about one of his
language consultants refers to ""[u]n vieil Indien"" (Métraux 1935:88). We know that
he must have worked with more than one person since Métraux mentions his
""informateurs uro"" (Métraux 1935:89). It can be inferred from his data that Métraux
worked with elderly people who were fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu. Although Métraux does not further specify the kind of relationship
between him and his language consultants, he mentions an unhappy incident that took
place during his stay. The two Bolivian soldiers, who accompanied Métraux to
Ancoaqui, became annoyed with some inhabitants of the village and threatened to
bum their houses (Métraux 1935:89). It is likely that this incident did not improve
matters for Métraux.
Together with Posnansky, Métraux stayed in Ancoaqui for one week in June
1931 (Métraux 1935:75). It remained Métraux's only visit to the community. The
resulting article Contribution à l'ethnographie et à la linguistique des indiens Uro
d'Ancoaqui (Bolivie) was published in 1935, i.e. four years later. The language used
in the article is French.
The article consists of an introduction with some notes on the literature
published so far on the Uchumataqu speakers and a brief report of the circumstances
97Among his professors were well-known anthropologists of his time, as e g. Marcel Mauss and Paul
Rivet Métraux departed from university with a PhD degree, the topic of his work was the material culture
of the Tupi-Guarani.
98
In the following years, Métraux became interested in areas outside South America and between 1948
and 1950, he carried out ethnographical research in Haiti (d'Ans 1978 21; quoted in: Sachot 2007:621) As
a result, Métraux published Le vaudou haïtien in 1958, which is one of his best known works, and for
which he became famous.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]"
"(Vellard 1951:21)There are some more cases in Métraux (1935) and the work of Vellard (1949-67)
where -u is missing, but those instances are not entirely clear and very often an
interpretation as another person is possible, too (5).

(Métraux 1935:97)The following statements are restricted to declarative clauses since verbs in interrogative or imperative
clauses behave differently (cf. 7 5 and 7 6).
In Chipaya, -u also serves to mark a first person plural inclusive. However, this is not attested for
Uchumataqu; instead, a first person plural inclusive is unmarked. In Métraux's work (1935) we find some
instances of a first person plural inclusive indicated with -u, but those cases are not entirely clear
Therefore, I consider -u strictly limited to first person singular460CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM

(Muysken 2005:56)Since second person singular to third person plural have no marker of their own, no
preceding suffixes can be listed462. The only morpheme that frequently follows verbs
in the simple present tense is declarative -cay, although this is not a rule because in a
few instances it is attached to other constituents as well. When -cay is not used, the
verb is completely unmarked (except for first person singular where -u is attached).
Although the example clauses are translated as simple present, semantics and /
or pragmatics point into the direction of actions or events happening at the moment
of speech (e.g. examples 1, 2, 6, 7). That is, these actions or events do not take place
over an extended period of time but are restricted in their temporal scope to the
moment of speaking and are therefore seen as conveying a progressive meaning
The following two examples contain a progressive form in their translation.

(Métraux 1935:91)Since except for first person singular, person reference is not indicated on the verb,
the use of pronouns and clitics should be important to the understanding of a clause.
For second person singular to third person plural it is most common to find a subject
or subject pronoun before the verb, but the use of a subject clitic is exceptional. The
most common way to mark first person singular is to attach -u to the verb, which
itself is preceded by a subject pronoun which bears a subject clitic -/ (cf. 1, 6).
Although it seems crucial to indicate person by pronouns and / or clitics, there are
many instances in which person is not marked at all (except for a first person singular

with respect to its allomorph -ska (see below). The form -sna appears with
(transitive) cognition and utterance verbs (73) as well as with (intransitive) states
(74), thereby turning them into transitive verbs.

spear spear-CAU-lMP
'Quickly, make [someone] spear it! '
impronto ensartale (unpez con un chuzo depescay)(Ve\\ard 1967:1)Even less evidence is available for the form -ska and therefore it is likewise uncertain
whether it marks a causative or whether it is a regular morpheme at all. However, if
the form -ska is an allomorph of causative -sna, there is a pattern of distribution
according to verb class (see above). Remarkably, the forms are apparently not
distributed according to transitivity, with e.g. one form attached only to intransitive
verbs and the other reserved for transitive ones. No hard and firm conclusions can be
drawn but it is possible that the notion of control may be of importance here (cf.
Payne 1997, referring to Haiman 1983)513. If this is true, causative -sna and its
allomorph -ska may indicate different degrees of control the causée exercises upon
the action. Then the form -sna marks a low degree of control on the causee's side
since one cannot choose what (s)he sees nor can e.g. a pot decide whether it is filled
or not. Similarly, the allomorph -ska, occuring with action and action-process verbs,
expresses that the causée exercises a higher degree of control since one can decide (at
least in theory) whether one wants to spear a fish or not. Therefore, one expects the
allomorph -ska to appear only with animate nouns.
As can be seen from the examples, causative -sna is attached directly to the verb
stem. In most cases, it is not followed by other morphemes although it can be
followed by imperative -a and clausal clitics as declarative -cay or topic marker
-λ/514.
From this, one would expect to find clear indication of person reference but in
fact most clauses do not contain person reference at all. If there is a pronoun, it refers

511
What the author says on the notion of control only serves as a basis for the following considerations I
do not apply Haiman's (1983a) theory here.
5,4
There are a few instances in which causative -sna is followed or preceded by elements such as -in, -ra,
or -CM (see example 76), none of which can be sufficiently explained Therefore, these instances are not
regarded as meaningful elements of Uchumataqu but rather as misinterpretations
512UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA232mainly to the causer, and only in two cases causer and causée are marked by
pronouns. It is to note that the data contain mainly singular items (as demonstrated in
examples 73 and 74) which do not constitute entire clauses and therefore it remains
uncertain how person reference would have been expressed. The following clause
(76) demonstrates the use of causer and causée where word order (causee-causer)
prevents a possessive interpretation.
(76)suwa wir lula-ska-cu-cay
childIeat-CAU-?-DEC'I feed the child (lit: 'I make the child eat.')·' (Muysken 2005:57)
It is only in Vellard's data (1949-67) that the form -am appears, which according to
Vellard (1967:33) marks a causative, as demonstrated below.
(77)ma:s-na

ana hipu saxk-aru
stone-iNS let_us cover-TOP NEG wind run-'make'
'Let's cover [it] with a stone so that the wind doesn't blow it up [make it
run].'
(Vellard 1949:162)However, the form -am occurs only with the verb saxk- 'to run' and example (77) is
the only complete clause that contains -am. Therefore, I do not regard the form -am
as marking a causative515 although a definite answer to what it expresses cannot be
given.
5.6 Nominalisation
Nominalisation describes the process by which a verbal root or stem changes its
grammatical category and becomes a noun, which then can be combined with
nominal morphemes. Uchumataqu has two nominalising morphemes, which are the
subject relativiser -ni whose main function is to mark an agent and the action
nominaliser s which serves to mark action nominalisation.
5.6.1 Subject relativiser -ni
Verbal subject relativiser -ni (SR) belongs to the nominalising suffixes. It fulfils
several functions of which its most typical one is to mark an agent. Although this is
not necessary, subject relativiser -ni often refers to an action that is specific or
characteristic of a person. This is attested e.g. for the word for 'sorcerer, magician'
sisni516 in (78). Here we find the conceptual link to the homonymous forms of
habitual present tense markers -in I -ni (cf. 5.1.2) which likewise mark an action or
event as habitually, i.e. characteristically, performed by somebody.

"(Vellard 1949:159)5.7.2 Switch reference -na (-an)
The form -na, and its possible variant -an, is found only three times, so the database
on which the following statements are based is severely limited. Furthermore, the
clauses that contain -na are not entirely clear and it may be possible that -na does not
mark subordination at all. However, if we assume that -na is used for subordination,
then it expresses switch reference (glossed as SWR) combined with nonsimultaneousness, i.e. the action expressed by the -«α-marked verb form still has to
happen.

The expression litrai is a loan from Spanish retrato 'portrait' However, the form tacikni remains
uncertain, particularly since Vellard (1949 186, translation mine) himself does not provide a further
analysis but only points out ""I am myself not absolutely sure about the transcription of tiks' na-tacikni, it
is a future form of die, meaning 'the one strechted out"".(""Je ne suis pas absolument sûr de la transcription
de liks' na-tacikni; c'est une forme future de mort, littéralement 'qui est étendu"" )
528UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA238The potential alternative form -an appears only once and there, an interpretation as
verb stem plus object marker -n is possible, too. The translation is based on Métraux
(ibid).

(Métraux 1935:97)
The form -an in example (96) is followed by Topic marker -ki, the use of which is
selected by the personal pronoun cuki 'let us'. But even if a clausal element such as
Topic marker -ki can appear on a subordinate verb form, we may assume that the use
of declarative -cay is impossible on a verb subordinated by -an or -na. According to
the examples (95) and (96), no morphemes precede the forms -an or -na.
The limited database on switch reference subordination markers does not allow
any statement about potential verb class restrictions532, normal word order, or the
distribution of pronominal and clitic elements. With respect to the latter, we may
assume that the use of subjects or subject pronouns is obligatory should -na indeed
mark switch reference. This requirement is fulfilled for examples (95) and (96).
It seems likely that particularly in its last stage Uchumataqu employed a
coordination strategy rather than switch reference subordination. In examples (97)
and (98), we find simple declarative clauses533 joined by coordination, each
containing its own subject or subject pronoun.

proposed interpretation of-na / -an is correct, the distribution does not point to a restriction with respect to
verb class

"(Métraux 1935:90)The word order of complement clauses is SOV, OV, or SV with the complement
preceding the matrix verb. If there is an indirect complement, it often precedes the
direct complement, as in (87) and (88).

('donne-moi plus de coca')(Metraux 1935 104)It may be possible that at an earlier stage of the language the form -ay indeed
designated second person singular to first person singular, but the meaning either
extended to mark second person singular in general or the distinction became lost due
to language attrition Since the data do not contribute to a clear distinction between
-a and -ay, the latter is regarded as an allomorph of the regular imperative second
person singular -a with the forms occunng m free alternation
As demonstrated in the examples, the imperative markers -a and -la can be
preceded by OB2 -n but in most cases they are directly attached to the verb stem
(which itself can be preceded by OBl s-) Accordingly, no further morphemes follow
the imperative markers except for topic marker -ki which happens regularly with the
substituted form cuki -ki The use of declarative -cay is clearly prohibited in order
to mark the form as imperative (cf tab 5 4) There is no restriction with respect to
verb class although verb semantics do not allow stative verbs to be inflected with the
imperative
With regard to the distribution of pronominal and clitic elements, in most cases
person reference is not indicated for second person singular Only a minority of
clauses contains pronouns, which shows that imperative marker -a is sufficient to
express person reference and personal pronouns may be considered emphatic
There are only four clauses containing imperative marker -la and two of them
also include a personal pronoun Thus, there is no basis to make any statements on
the form -la However, with the substitution form cuki -ki, the personal pronoun is
obligatory since the verb form itself lacks any distinctive feature Thus, cuki is
required in order to establish person reference No instance was found where clitic
elements alone contribute to person reference
5 8 2 Irrealis -aca
The mood and modality marker irreahs -aca (IR) fulfils several functions, which will
be discussed in the following sections
5 8 2 1 Conditional
Irrealis -aca may express a condition and can be translated as 'if
(113)(114)ana-s

I-TOP
gO-RES-IR-DEC you-COM
'If I had been young, I would have gone with you (sg) ' (Uhle 1894 90)As shown in the example clauses, the marker is either directly attached to the verb
stem or can be preceded by resultative -/ which then is reduced to a past meaning (see244UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAsection 5.2.1). Thus, the temporal relationship expressed in a conditional clause is
either Past, indicated by resultative -t, or present tense. Irrealis -aca is not followed
by other morphemes except declarative -cay.
5.8.2.2 Optative
Irrealis -aca may also express an Optative, i.e. a wish or a desire.
(115)diabolo cix-cfaj-aki

carry-lR-FU
'To hell with him!' (lit.: 'The devil shall take him!')

rain-HP-iR-TOP'May it [habitually] rain.' 544(Uhle 1894:92.2)The two examples reflect the uncertainty that arises with the ambivalent morpheme
combination -caki. In (115), it can be regarded as consisting of irrealis -ac(a)
followed by future tense -aki, or else as comprising the irrealis plus topic marker -ki,
as in (116). No firm conclusions can be drawn but the lack of declarative -cay points
to topic marker -ki, as does the fact that a wish is expressed, i.e. something not yet
ftilfilled. Thus, depending on the interpretation, irrealis -aca can be followed by
either topic marker -ki or future tense -aki, and is attached to the verb stem.
Accordingly, the temporal relationship expressed by the Optative is either present or
future tense although the first seems to be more likely.
5.8.2.3 Potential
The Potential describes an ability and is therefore best translated as 'can'.

(Vellard 1949:166)As can be seen, irrealis -aca is attached either to the verb stem or can be preceded by
resultative -t and certainty -kala (see 5.2.1; 5.9). It is followed only by declarative
544The interpretation of cut-in as the verb root cix- 'to rain' and -;n as the habitual present tense marker is
not entirely certain An interpretation as έιχι- with a final root vowel -/ and -n as the object marker 2 would
also be possible. However, the use of object marker 2 -n on an intrasitive verb such as cix(i)- 'to rain'
appears to be arguable and therefore I decided to interpret the construction cix-in as shown in example
(116). It has to be noted that this interpretation is, however, not entirely certain.

(Vellard 1967:7, 20)In each of the examples, morpheme boundaries are clear-cut, which makes it possible
to establish e.g. okwa- as a verbal stem and -aki as a morpheme attached to it. To each
of these suffixes, a meaning can be unequivocally assigned, e.g. -aki marks future
tense and -naka expresses plural. Further, the shape of the morphemes remains
mainly unaltered278 and recognisable, regardless of whether they are attached to e.g. a

Except for smaller adjustments to the phonological environment, which may result in allophones, as is
the case with e.g subject relativiser -ni and its allophone -m, which can be conditioned by following high

277CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS133transitive or intransitive verb. These features sufficiently satisfy the requirements for
establishing Uchumataqu as an agglutinating language279.
However, although the overall profile of Uchumataqu is that of an agglutinating
language, there are features reminiscent of either fusional or isolating language types.
It is particularly in the verbal system that portmanteau morphemes, characteristic for
fusional languages, are found. Thus, -u not only marks present tense but it also refers
to first person singular as does -a, marking future tense with first person singular.
Similar observations are made for the so-called In-Group Marker -acu, which
expresses first person plural exclusive and present tense, and habitual present tense
Marker -in I -ni, which encodes both a temporal (present tense) and aspectual
(Habitual) notion. Thus, these suffixes comprise two categories, mainly tense and
person marking ""to give a single, unsegmentable morph"" (Comrie 1981:41).
Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some isolating tendencies, particularly in the
pronominal system, where no difference is expressed between e.g. a pronominal
subject and a possessive pronoun280, as in (14) and (15):
(14)(15)am qoya
you house
'your (sg) house'(Uhle 1894:46)·am ok tafnj-ni
you go hunt-SR
'you (sg) go hunting (lit.: 'you go as a hunter')' (Uhle 1894:94.1)These differences with respect to typical agglutinating languages, such as Aymara
and Quechua, have already been observed by Muysken (2000:104) and, as Comrie
(1981:43) points out ""the majority (perhaps all) of the world's languages do not
correspond exactly to one or other of these types [i.e. isolating, agglutinating, or
fusional KH]"".
3.3 Affixation and cliticisation
Uchumataqu has prefixes, affixes, and clitics. Prefixes are by far the smallest group
consisting of only two types found on verbs. The first type is object markerl s- which
marks a first person singular as object.
