"10.10. The ordering of object, agent and subject
In 10.1. I suggested that it is not possible to approach certain questions of word order
with only the issue of ""grammaticality"" in mind, in Wardaman and other Australian
languages. Informants, when asked, will approve different orders within the phrase and
the elicitation sentence as grammatically acceptable and meaningful. But another matter
is what they will actually say themselves, with all the attendant questions of relative
frequency of different orders, and the meaningful organization of textual matter. The
clause is the understood unit of analysis with respect to which summaries of major
constituent ordering are usually made (as in formulae such as SVO, SOV etc.). But this
assumes that issues of ordering are fundamentally issues of clause-level grammatical
structure. There are however many other issues besides grammaticality which have to
do with the occurrence and ordering of nominal constituents.
Some observations drawn from text material will be summarized here about the
positioning of the direct object, the ergative-marked transitive agent, and the intransitive
subject. These observations were made on text material that had been organized into
tone units. As I noted above this chapter, this organization was basic in that no thorough
analysis into primary and secondary intonation units was made, although such further
study seems promising. Rather, a simple division into tone units or contours was made
on the main criterion of pitch movement (generally but not always strongly linked with
pause phenomena). Once this is done, it becomes possible to talk about ordering of overt
noun phrases fulfilling major syntactic functions within the tone unit and with respect to
an occurring verb.
There is an important general issue of the lexical realization of participants. The other
side of the coin is ellipsis (and what may be somewhat different, failure for participants
to be lexically specified through local portions of text, a more general question of
narrative style that will not be further discussed). The fact that two nominal functions
may be marked on the inflecting Wardaman verb by pronominal prefixes is linked to theIssues in constituency and word order 247fact of extensive nominal ellipsis particularly of nominals in intransitive and transitive
subject functions.
For instance, in the text Jalijbang, the protagonist Moon is introduced lexically in unit
(1) by his subsection, Yiwalyarri, but is not designated again lexically until unit (83),
where he is referred to as gandawag 'moon'. By that time he has been the understood
agent of 31 transitive constructions and numerous intransitive ones. There is only one
occurrence of an ergative-marked noun in the entire text of 110 units, at 102 where
Moon's wives return, figure out what has happened, and say, Oh! here the old man-ERG
is keeping/has his mother-in-law. The relatively straightforward story-line as told, one
might say, makes it possible for Moon to be the understood and largely ellipsed agent
and subject of numerous transitive and intransitive verbs (and, interestingly, in this story
the object of none).
In the text Gawalyan, the first main character introduced is echidna herself. She is
identified by the single noungawalyan 'echidna' on the first tone unit of the text. This
is not ergative-marked, despite the fact that the next unit gives the information ""She had
a small child"". The naming of echidna simply identifies her, and carries no clear
indication of grammatical function. Such naming as the content of a tone unit, amounting
to apposition of participants rather than specification of grammatical function, is a
common feature of Wardaman text. In the Gawalyan text, echidna is not lexically
identified again until line 26, where some birds ask her husband to lend his wife
fyingawuyu) to them for sexual intercourse. This request, with lexical designation of
echidna as ""wife"", is repeated in line 28. Then there is no further lexical identification
of echidna until a final one in line 43, where she is described as having beenyibarnbarnin
'naked, hairless', until she was speared for refusing the birds, and so acquired quills.
There is no instance of ergative-marked agent in the entire text; for after the aggressor
birds have been lexically identified once (in lines 22 and 23, on tone units which name
them in absolutive case form), they are designated only by pronominal prefixes (subject
and object) on the verb throughout the remainder of the text.
The two cases above might be among the texts where there is least lexical designation
of protagonists, and reference maintenance to protagonists principally through
pronominal prefixation. A text which shows more considerable lexical specification of
protagonists is Gumurrinji and Bornorron ""Emu and Brolga"". Here, emu asks brolga to
mind her children along with brolga's own while emu goes out foraging, and as in some
Shakespearean plots, there is ample possibility for confusioa Perhaps for that reason,
emu is lexically designated 6 times in a relatively short text, as is brolga; three of the
latter occurrences are Ergative-marked, as brolga maliciously destroys emu's children
while she is away. Nevertheless there is no case in which both agent and object are
lexically specified on the same tone unit, and thus no specific evidence for the ordering
of ""brolga"" and ""emu"" with respect to each other as lexemes in particular major syntactic
functions. Overall, lexical specification of agent and object in the same tone unit is rare
textually, but there are instances (such as Dalyarra line 30, ""two-ERG women- ERG held
her legs-ABS on either side"", or the order AVO).
In attempting to calculate the occurrence of overt nominals as agents, subjects and
objects, it seemed important to distinguish cases in which they occurred within the same248 Chapter 10tone unit as the verbal word(s) bearing pronominal agreement, versus those in which they
occurred on another tone group (often, set off as simple nouns or nominal expressions
on a tone unit by themselves in absolutive form, or sometimes with case specification).
Table 18 shows tabulations derived from 24 texts of nominal (including pronominal)
elements in given functions — as direct objects, intransitive subjects, and (ergativemarked) agents, and their position pre- or post-verbally within the tone unit.

61There is a higher absolute number of lexically specified objects throughout the texts
compared to the other two categories. Ergative-marked agents are much less common
over all texts than are subjects and objects. There is a tendency for lexically specified
nouns or noun phrases in all functions to occur more frequently before the verbal word
rather than after it. In the long Elsie text, for example, 40 specified objects occur within
tone units before the verbal word, and 31 after it. Objects and ergative-marked agents
show much less difference as between position before and after the verbal word than do
subjects, which show a rather more marked tendency to occur before the verb.
In the Elsie text, of 17 instances of ergative-marked agent noun or noun phrase, 4
occurred on a tone group set off by themselves. In each of those instances the noun or
noun phrase follows the tone unit containing the verb which carries its pronominal
reference. In one case of an ergative agent so set off, it follows a tone unit with
ergative-marked noun, and gives a different description of the referent (i.e., in the first
unit the ergative marked noun is nntlwru-yi Old woman', the one set off by itself,
barnagbarnang-nyi 'auntie', an alternative description).
Of the 17 instances of ergative marking, in only two tone units are both agent and object
lexically specified In one case the order is VOA (bujnrri walanja nuilurru-yi Old
woman dug the goanna', where both goanna and the old woman have been previously
mentioned and are clearly recoverable). In the second, the order is OVA (a nawurla
wu-di-rri-ya-wuya nnilitrru-wuya-yi ' Oh! the two old women have brought nawurla').
In every instance, the ergative-marked noun or noun phrase is human. There are 7
occurrences oinuilurm ornnilurni-wnya' old woman' or' two old women'; 5 oimeniden
'white man'; 3 of kin terms; 1 of mar lug a ' old man'; and 1 of a personal name.
In the Galapin text, there are 9 ergative-marked instances. In only two of these are both
agent and object present. One of these is an unusual case of verbal ellipsis (see 10.13.);
but the order of noun phrases is A O. In the second, the order is AVO.","[270, 271, 272]"

Issues in constituency and word order10.1. The question of fn:e word order
As modern description of Ausfalian languages intensified from the early 1970s, it was
commonly said that they exhibited ""free"" word order, both at the level of the phrase and
the clause (Dixon 1972; Sharpe 1972; see also more recently Simpson 1991, Chapter 2,
where ""free word order"" is desc ibed as a defining dimension of ""non-configurationality""
for the Pama-Nyungan language, Warlpiri). The general claim is that constituent wordlevel units can be found in almost any order and the phrase or clause still be grammatically
acceptable. Taken in that baiic sense, Wardaman, too, exhibits greater freedom of
ordering than does English, for example.
Some researchers, however, have reported of their languages that not all orders are
equally common within the pirase or clause (Heath 1984; Merlan 1988; McGregor
1990). They have observed tha: ordering is freer than in English and many of the world's
better-known languages, but ha /e sought to open the question, Free with respect to what?
In other words, they have begun to explore the question whether the grammatical notion
of the ""clause"" is the appropriate basis in terms of which to describe ordering phenomena.
In my opinion, the answer wh ch is beginning to emerge from this work is that other
levels of analysis—for example, intersections between constituent structure possibilities
and their typical prosodically organized syntagmatic realizations — must be the units
against which different word-level orderings, and their differing frequency and
meaningfulness, need to be defined.
We can illustrate from Wardaman examples the difficulties which arise in attempting
to define any particular noun phrase on the basis of constituent structure only, in order
to show how these problems have informed the approach taken further on in this chapter.
Many of the issues involved have been previously noted for their general descriptive
interest. Consider the first few lines of the text (appended) Jalijbang, about a moon
dreaming place on Innesvale Siation.
A protagonist, of Yiwalyarri iubsection, is identified. Then:
(527) yanggi bogogo gangma.i yorri
'He went hunting and sheared a kangaroo'
mangali
'a female'
wurre-warang
'with young/a joey'.
Then the information given to that point is summarized:224 Chapter 10(528) yorri nana gangman wiirre-warang
'He speared the kangaroo with a joey'.
Obviously, in the text as given, line divisions have already been made which appear to
be of some significance. These, as will be described, are tone groups. At first,
information is being conveyed in a manner that may be called ""expansion"": only a small
""bit"" is given in each apparent unit. Then a structurally more elaborate summation is
given, that is, one in which the word-level units can evidently be assumed to comprise a
whole unit (in this case, clause) in a way the preceding shorter units cannot. That clause
contains a nominal constituent structure which is not uncommon in Wardaman,
consisting of a demonstrative determiner, plus nominal plus a nominal modifier of the
""having X"" kind described in 5.3. In fact, as we will see, phrases consisting of the first
two elements — demonstrative plus open-class nominal — are the commonest kind of
two-word noun phrase in Wardaman, and the position of the ""having"" modifier following
the entity is also typical (although such ""having"" constructions may of course occur by
themselves, as the sole word of a noun phrase). The more elaborate phrase shows us a
typical way in which the NP may be realized by a syntagm of words. The preceding
lines, however, cannot be identified as a single NP. One of the main reasons for that must
be taken to be the fact that preceding words do not all occur within a single unit as defined
by prosodic criteria. Semantically, we see that the descriptions ""female"", and ""having
joey"" further specify the reference of ""kangaroo"", for which here the generic term, rather
than any existing, specifically female term, was originally used. A phrase consisting of
an open-class nominal such as ""kangaroo"", and then followed within the same tone unit
by two additional nominal descriptors, would in fact be unusual. It is best to conclude
that in the preceding lines ""kangaroo"", ""female"", and ""having joey"" do not constitute a
phrase, continuous or discontinuous, but together constitute a typical association of
prosodically distinguished units of information.
To even begin to assemble the evidence concerning what may, and what may not,
constitute a ""phrase"", we have to have some criteria of identification. One must, as is
ordinarily done, take into account the possible function or role of given words within a
conceivable grammatical constituent structure; but identification as a phrase cannot be
made ONLY on such grammatical bases, concerning the possible assignment of words to
constituent structure. If that were the only criterion, we might be tempted for example
to regardgangnian mangali wurre-warang as a discontinuous noun phrase, and perhaps
also to attempt permutations of these words in relation to the verb ""speared"", in order to
establish possibilities of ordering within the clause as a whole. Any or all of such
attempted permutations, I feel quite confident, would be accepted by informants as
intelligible. In doing that, however, we would lose sight of the fact that a group such as
gangnian ntangali wurre-warang is at least not usual within a single prosodically defined
unit.
It is common for constituent structure to be defined with respect to attested examples
which show the apparent full range of possibilities of realization. What I am suggesting
here, however, may appear to some to go too far: that is, that what may count as an attested
example of a particular kind must be defined with respect to some apparently significantIssues in constituency and word order 225criteria that belong to other levels of linguistic organization beyond the simply
grammatical. We have noted the common report that, when what is taken as the central
issue is ""grammaticality"", many Australian languages appear to exhibit such freedom in
ordering that the result has often been stated as ""any order is possible"". But that does not
tell us what orderings are morj frequent than others, or distinguish the meaningfulness
of the different orders. And when frequency becomes an issue alongside grammaticality,
then it must also be asked, in what contexts do particular orders occur? Ways must be
found of discriminating different linguistic contexts, and I am simply suggesting that that
cannot be done with respect :o the same phenomenon one is attempting, in the first
instance, to describe — grammatical function within constituency. Rather it must be
done with respect to actual realizations of syntagms which differ meaningfully.
Obviously, like some other Australianists (Heath 1984; McGregor 1990; all of us
following Halliday and others of the Firthian school), I accept that prosodically defined
units appear to be a significant and much under-studied resource for identifying contexts
with respect to which different realizations of constituent structure may be defined.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"
"10.2. Information units, given/new and theme/rheme contrasts
Halliday (1985 and earlier) suggests that two major dimensions of textual organization
in English have to do with ""information"" and ""thematisation"" (see also McGregor 1990
for application of Hallidayan concepts to the Western Australian language Gooniyandi).
Information is concerned wit ι the given/new opposition, and thematisation with the
theme/rheme, or topic/comm:nt, opposition. He further suggests that information
structure is primarily expressed prosodically, while the thematic structure is realised
through constituent order. In the previous section I suggested the importance of
considering constituency and prosody in relation to each other, in order to achieve a
descriptive scheme which delimits phrase structure and ordering possibilities within the
phrase in a meaningful way. For present purposes, I consider the use of prosodically
defined units to be one of the most helpful methodological offerings of the Halliday
framework, mainly because it provides an opening into the study of the interaction
between grammaticality and other levels of the organization of text.
Halliday (1985: 274) observes that an information unit does not correspond exactly to
any unit in the clause grammar, but other things being equal, tends to be coextensive with
one clause, as the ""default"" ccndition in English. Each information unit is realized as a
pitch contour, or TONE, which extends over the whole tone group. Within the tone group,
one foot or syllable carries thi main pitch movement, and the element which has this
feature of tonic prominence is said to carry the information focus. The tonic foot marks
where the 'new' element of information ends. Halliday (1985:277) considers information
that is presented by the speaker as recoverable as ""given"", and that which is presented
as not recoverable to be ""new"".
The Wardaman texts appended to this grammar were realized as sequences of tone units.
Each such unit is identified by number. Many are short and occupy only one line. The
main criterion for identifying ;i tone unit is on the basis that it is bounded by significant
pitch movement, either a rise or a fall. Typically, such a unit is also bounded by short226 Chapter 10pause, but the presence of pause is not in itself defining of a tone group. In some cases
it is ambiguous whether a particular stretch of speech is best identified as two tone units
or as one. This is especially the case where it appears that there may be some pitch
movement at the possible tone unit boundary, but pitch remains relatively constant
(compared to other instances). In other words, questions of identification may arise
because intonational phenomena are perceived as a matter of degree. The temptation to
identify a separate tone unit may be strengthened where there is also pause at such a
possible boundary, but as noted above, pause in itself is not definitional of the tone unit.
As McGregor (1990: 362) notes for Gooniyandi, tone units in Wardaman do not
necessarily correspond to grammatical units, although they do so in particular cases. As
has often been noted for Australian languages (and as in the Moon Dreaming text, above),
a single nominal word may frequently be found on a tone unit of its own, set apart from
other constituents to which it is meaningfully linked. Because nominal and other words
are frequently set off in this way on their own tone unit, a number of such units together
may contain the information that might otherwise be contained within a clause. At the
same time, it may often happen, as Halliday has shown for English, that a tone group will
be equivalent to a clause, as for the Moon Dreaming group ""he speared the kangaroo
with joey"". In the case of smaller constituent units which may comprise part of a clause,
I make the assumption that while whatever set of nominal words occurs on a single tone
unit may comprise (one or more) noun phrases, it is not legitimate to assume that nominal
constituents occurring in different tone groups constitute part of the same particular
phrase (although the same actual forms may occur elsewhere as part of a phrase on a
single tone group). Thus, in the above Moon Dreaming example, mangali 'female' and
wurre-warang cannot be regarded as part of the same noun phrase, even though these
two words might occur together elsewhere within a tone unit and as part of a noun phrase.
That is, I am prepared to use occurrence on a single tone unit as a minimum condition,
necessary but not sufficient, for the identification as a noun phrase of any given set of
nominal words.
Following Grimes (1975) and others, it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction
to be made between more central or primary tone units, and secondary ones (see
McGregor 1990: 364). In such a scheme, the primary unit may be defined by greater
prominence of its salient syllable, and by greater pitch movement over the contour. A
secondary unit, whatever its precise character, may be defined as in association with a
primary one, and generally characterized negatively, by lesser syllable salience and lesser
pitch movement. McGregor (1991: 365) suggests for Gooniyandi that the primary unit
normally contains the propositional nexus: the verbal complex in clauses with verbs.
Further, secondary units normally consist of a single clausal constituent: NP, adverbial,
or other. McGregor goes on to hypothesize the existence of a tonic sentence, defined as
a primary unit in association with one or more optional secondary ones. In information
terms, the secondary unit(s) tend(s) to elaborate the primary one, or otherwise convey
information closely related to that of the primary unit. I have not put this plausible
distinction between primary and secondary units to work in this description, that is, units
in the texts are not identified as primary or secondary. I would only note that the
distinction might be profitably elaborated as a set of typical primary-secondary tone unitIssues in constituency and word order 227nexus types; for example, there is a prosodic relation of dependency between the
(typically short and unelaboraied) tone units containing a ""say"" verb, and the unit(s)
which realize the reported speech which the verb projects.
There follows consideration of the constituency of the noun phrase, and in 10.8. a
summary of noun phrase structire types. This is given together with discussion of normal
ordering within the phrase. While no doubt further meaningful distinctions made by
ordering remain to be discerned, it is suggested that regular meaningful differences in
the presentation of information appear to be associated in some instances with the
difference between the orders: demonstrative determiner followed by nominal, versus
nominal followed by demonstrative determiner (DEM + N versus N + DEM). I will
propose that this difference may be seen as part of the organization of difference between
unmarked and marked Theme types, that is, less or more remarkable organization of what
any particular tone unit or sequence of them is ""about"". A further introductory word may
be useful here about the notion of theme.
Again following Halliday (1935:278-279) in his elaboration of Firthian and Pragueian
notions, thematic structure may be defined as that dimension in which is organized what
a stretch of speech is about. Theme is commonly defined as (1) the point of departure
of what the speaker has to say, or more fully, (2) what the speaker is talking about, the
topic; while Rheme is commonly defined as the completion of this point of departure, or
the comment. Obviously, the £ iven/new contrast may interact closely with the theme/
rheme one, in that, for example, it is possible for something to be presented as either an
expected or unexpected, a givei or not given, point of departure.
Finally, we will need to consider how to approach the question of the presence and
ordering of nominal constituents of clause-level syntactic function, intransitive Subject,
transitive Object, and ergative-marked Agent. It is common enough for such functions
to be marked only on the verb within any given tone unit, that is, for there to be no overt
nominal expression of any given major clause function. Some discussion of lexical
realization of these functions is thus required, because case-marking of them is obviously
dependent upon their occurrence. But beyond that, is it possible to say that an occurring
nominal typically precedes or :bllows the verb of which it is the object? To the extent
that the agent of a transitive verb is realized by a nominal expression, where does this
occur with respect to the verb1; We will see that the ergative-marked agent is the least
frequently occurring of the three syntactic types, and that there is a tendency for all three
to occur preceding the verbal word or words; but that this tendency is apparently strongest
for nouns and noun phrases in intransitive subject function, noticeable but not extreme
for ergative-marked transitive igents, and least noticeable for transitive objects, which
occur both pre- and post-verba ly with more nearly equal frequency.","[249, 250, 251]"
"Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 129The elementgu is foundin all plural-object forms except those with 3NSG object where
the subject is first or second person, and in the first person on 2NSG object forms. Thus
gu marks nonsingularity of the object in those forms in which it occurs. Heath (1976)
has suggested comparatively concerning n and gu that these were historically
complementary, with n following vowel-final object prefixes, andgu following prefix
complexes with final nonsingular element rr (or equivalent). If one accepts this, it then
becomes necessary to assume that the accusative marker spread so that it also followed
gu. The distribution of n is now wide, and it is no longer limited, as it may historically
have been, to marking object chiefly in combinations with singular object, which would
have largely been correlated with vowel-final prefix combinations.
However, Wardaman poses three problems of different kinds and seriousness for these
historical assumptions about the original complementary distribution of n and gu as
phonologically-conditioned markers of singular and nonsingular objects, respectively.
The first problem concerns forms with 1DU IN object which would not have contained
nonsingular morpheme rr, but yet, as objects, are followed by gu. The second concerns
3NSG object forms which do not havegi* where the subject is a first or second person
category. Here however we must assume that 3NSG as object with first and second
subject categories never exhibited the nonsingular marker rr, which is associated with
subject forms; thus its forms as subject would have been wu-rr, but its form as object
with those categories, wu.
The third problem has to do with the absence of gu in the forms with first person subject
on 2NSG object. The subject marker for this category is nu\ thus we may assume that
there has been no nonsingular rr marker in this category (but note that the Absolutive
2NSG free pronoun is niirrug). In the 1
>2 forms at issue, 2NSG is followed only
by accusative n as we would expect if this were a vowel-final category. On the other
hand, 2NSG object forms with third subject show the element g», and in the terms of the
proposed historical distribution of n and n we would expect thisgz< to have followed rr,
but there is no reason to posit its historical presence in the form.
Alternatively it might be suggested, in the case of the 1DU and the 2NSG object forms
mentioned, that the function as gu as nonsingular object marker allowed it to be
generalized to 1DUIN object forms and 2NSG forms with third subject, but not to
1
>2NSG forms where a different process, plural object neutralization (see below)
has shaped the structure of the 1
> 2 categories.
A genera] characteristic of the Wardaman prefix system is, in sum, that case relations
are made explicit not by different shapes of person markers covarying with fwcuonper
se, but chiefly by the presence of the relational marker n, along with the contrast between
nonsingular subject element r r versus object element gu.
Another feature of the system is that, excepting the UN forms, there is one
morphologically singular and one nonsingular category in each person (as in the free
pronouns). That is, there is no dual-plural distinction except in UN.
There are regularities in the ordering of pronominal elements, but these relate, not
simply to respective subject and object function of the two adjuncts, but to the feature
specification of the two in relation to each other. There are approximately equal numbers
of forms in which the order is OS and S-O. The kinds of combinations exhibiting each130 Chapter 6order differ, however. The S-O combinations include all 1
>2, 1
>3, and
2
>3. The O-S combinations include all the opposite relationships, 2
»1,
3
»1, and 3
»2. Combinations with third person subject and/or object are
indeterminate, since both categories are always zero. In the combinations with 3NSG
object, the 3NSG
»3NSG forms plainly shows O-S order.
The facts of ordering allow us to rank three categories below, and other considerations
of formal patterning (the presence of gu in e.g., 3SG
>3NSG, for example) lead us
to add the fourth, 3SG category, despite the fact that it is always formally zero, as follows:vI
II
III NSG
IIISGArrows indicate the determination of ordering. That is, the descending arrow is meant
to indicate that the subject is a ""higher"" category and the object a ""lower"" one; these are
the combinations with S-O ordering. The ascending arrow represents combinations
where subject is a lower category and object a higher one. These are the O-S
combinations. An ordering principle may be stated in relation to these categories:
1.
In any subject-object combination where order is identifiable, a pronominal of a
higher category will appear before a pronominal of a lower one, no matter what the
case function of the two.
This means, for example, that a first person pronominal element will appear before any
other, no matter whether it is marking subject or object function.
We may refer to the S-O combinations as ""direct"", and the O-S ones as ""inverse"".8 This
distinction will be useful in providing a way of describing the distribution of gu. Before
that can be summarized, however, we need to formulate two instances of neutralization
of pronominal number.
From the set of occurring forms, it can be seen that 1EX NSG
>2SG and 1EX
NSG
»2NSG are identical: yi-nu-n-. The difference in object number has been
neutralized, and the occurring 2 morph -nu- is that elsewhere associated with nonsingular
number:
2.
Object neutralization. In 1EXNSG
>2 forms, the formal number distinction
between 2SG and 2NSG object is neutralized, and the semantically singular object
is marked with nonsingular form.
A second number neutralization can be seen in the fact that there is no difference
between 3NSG
»2SG and 3SG
>2SG; both are yimburr-. The distinction
found elsewhere between 3SG and 3NSG subject is neutralized in the second form, with
semantically singular subject marked by nonsingular /wu-rr/.
8. These useful terms were diffused into the Australianist literature from Algonquian studies in
Heath (1976).","[152, 153, 154]"
"128 Chapter 6First person singular is always first in the prefix complex, as subject or object; and a
glance at the tables shows that all first person categories are ordered first, regardless of
whether they are subject or object.
1 EXNSG is always represented by person marker yi- both as subject and object, and
in forms with 1 EXNSG acting on third person object, this is always followed by
nonsingular marker -rr-.
1INDU is always represented by ngayi-, as subject and object.
1INPL is always marked by person marker nga- as subject or object, together with
nonsingular -rr- as subject with third person object.
2SG subject is represented by yi- with third person objects, by -m- with first person
objects. It appears first in the prefix complex as subject with third person objects (S-O),
but follows first person in 2SG subject on first person forms (O-S). 2SG object is marked
by -ng- with first person subject, and here the order is S-O; by nu- (basically a 2NSG
form) when the subject is 1 EXNSG, and here the order is S-O; and by yi- person marker
with third person subjects, and here the order is O-S.
2NSG is always represented by person marker nu- as subject or object. It always follows
first person elements whatever its function, and precedes third person markers, regardless
of function.
3SG subject is always zero; 3NSG subject is always -wu-rr-, and follows all object
markers. A summary of this global allomorphy of person and number markers is:

subject-object relations. The first of these is accusative marker n. This marker may be
taken to occur twice in many forms, following the object person marker, and following
the element gu where this is present (see discussion of this assumption below). The
accusative marker occurs in all 3

"6.7. Person-marking in the verb
Every finite verb in Wardaman is prefixed with pronominal(s) expressing the category
of grammatical subject for all clauses, and also the category of direct object if the clause
is transitive. As noted in 5.2., the Wardaman verb has a maximum of two pronominal
form-order slots, filled by two pronominal series which are called ""subject"" and ""object"".
In ditransitive clauses — i.e., those with predicates which occur in construction with two
major, Absolutive non-subject nominals — the notional indirect rather than direct object
is marked in the pronominal complex by the object prefix series, and of course the
transitive agent by means of the subject pronominal series. The notional direct object
cannot be marked on the verb in the ditransitive clause.
Table 6 shows the set of prefixes which mark the subject in intransitive clauses, i.e.,
the set, members of which occur as sole pronominal adjuncts to the verb. Tables 7 and
8 show the transitive-clause prefix combinations, those with both subject and object slots
filled. The morphology of the intransitive subject prefixes is uncomplicated, and the
morpheme divisions can be shown simply alongside the occurring forms in one table.
The transitive ones, however, are not simply analyzable in all instances as the subject
prefixes combined with a segmentable object series; some forms are morphologically124 Chapter 6more complicated, or portmanteau-like, than this. Hence two kinds of tables are given
for the transitive combinations, one showing the occurring forms of the prefix
combinations, and the second positing morpheme identity and segmentatioa
Two factors complicate the discussion of the prefixes, and need to be introduced. It is
useful to make a basic distinction between ""past"" and ""non-past"" Wardaman verbal tensemood-aspect categories; and it is necessary, further, to recognize a distinction between
""indicative"" or ""realis"" versus ""irrealis"" forms of the verb. The former distinction allows
us to state in relation to it the distribution of a third-person, initial prefix element να-:
this occurs on third person ""non-past"" forms of the verb, including Present, Future,
Potential and Admonitive (""lest"" etc.) forms, and does not occur in the Past tense (nor in
mood categories including Hortative and Imperative). The initial non-past third person
element να- is not explicitly a person marker, but is linked to person categories in the
following way: it occurs only on non-past forms with third person subject as the sole
pronominal category in the verb, or in transitive combinations where third person is both
subject and object. Thus, 3SG PRES ya-0-nyanga-n 'he/she/it is coming' with -0marking the 3SG category\ya-wud-janga-n 'they (NSG) are coming' with /wurr/ (see
3.5.1.) marking the 3NSG category; ya-0-nyangi-we 'he/she/it will come', PUT;
ya-0-nyanga-yan 'he/she/it may come' POT. In the transitive 3
* 3 combinations,
the initial να- absorbs or represents a contraction of the usual prefix segments as these
may be seen from the Past forms, where the initial ya- does not occur. Compare for
example, 3SG
> 3NSG and 3NSG
* 3NSG in Present and Past tenses:3SG»3NSG3NSG—*· 3NSGPast
wwtggim-bii-ndiPresent
yanggnn-bit-nwimggwibiirr-bu-ncuyanggunbiirr-bii-n'he hit/is hitting
them'
'they hit/are
hitting them'For reasons that will become clearer when the prefixal morphology is examined in
detail, wiinggnn- must be identified as the basic shape of the 3SG
»3NSG
combination. On that basis, in the present we would expect ya-wmggun- but instead
find the actually-occurring form to be contracted, as showa In 3SG
»3SG
combinations, both subject and object pronominals are zero, and the initial prefix yaoccurs as the only prefixal element, i.e., (pedantically)ya-0-O-bii-n 'he/she/it is hitting
him/her/it'. (In texts and interlinear glosses double zeroes in 3SG
»3SG
combinations are not written in this way).
The second, greater complication in the prefix system is one involving the marking of
the major mood distinction between indicative and irrealis forms. In terms of this
contrast, indicative categories are unmarked, and irrealis marked The marking of irrealis
is implemented in two ways, and in some forms both occur: by an outer mood prefix of
the shapeyi- for (most) non-third person (except 1EX NSG) categories, andya-yi- for
third person categories; and by some differences, compared with indicative inflection, in
the form of the person-marking pronominals themselves. In the irrealis mood third
person complex ya-yi-, the first element may probably be identified with the initialIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 125non-past ya- described above7, and the ->'/- with the irrealis prefix shape which occurs
with other persons. Since the mood prefixes are easily segmented from the pronominals,
there are no phonological distortions of the kind illustrated above with non-past ya-; but
the important observation to be made is a morpho-syntactic one, that morphological
irrealis verb forms inflect for person and number somewhat differently than the
corresponding indicative forms. In this way, mood and person-marking are linked
systems, just as tense-aspect and person-marking are, in the presence or absence of initial
non-past ya-, also linked systems.
For clarity of presentation, all indicative prefix forms will be discussed first, and a final
section will make explicit the differences between person-marking in indicative and
irrealis verb forms. The verbal categories themselves are discussed elsewhere
(Chapter 8).
6.7.1. Intransitive prefixes (indicative mood)
The prefixes which occur as adjuncts to the verb in intransitive clauses are set out in
Table 6. Non-past third person prefix ya- is indicated in parentheses; past forms are the
same as those given, minus this prefix.

\vu-rr-7. An initial, third-person prefix comparable to ya- occurs in non-past categories in a number of
neighbouring languages (e.g., Jawoyn, and with some differences, also Mangarrayi). However,
in those languages the prefix is limited to the non-past, and contrasts with zero in the past
categories. In Wardaman, what is apparently etymologically the same element ya- occurs in
the irrealis, and may occur in the past irrealis. Further discussion, however, makes it clear that
ya- probably diffused into the irrealis paradigm in order to prevent homophony of a considerable
number of otherwise homo-phonous forms. Therefore in its occurrence in the irrealis, να- cannot
be considered directly comparable to the non-past marker ya- though, as noted, it is probably
etymologically the same form.","[147, 148, 149]"
"Issues in constituency and word order 24310.8. Summary of noun phrase constituency
We may now draw together a summary of basic noun phrase constituency discussed so
far, and briefly consider aspects of noun phrase coordination.
We may minimally identify structural noun phrase types as shown in Table 17.
17. Noun phrase structures
Type(l)Type(2)NPNP(N, PRO) (N)Type (3a)(3b)
NPSDem N(3c)
NPAdj (Adv) N Poss Ntype
NP4
NPNP NP NPIn Type 1, the noun phrase consists of a single lexical noun or personal pronoun, and
there is no phrase-internal syntax.
Type 2 has a clause-level constituent, and is a cover term for the general subordinate
clause type discussed in 8.15., and for the complex particle and nominalized verbal
complementizers which are discussed in Chapter 11. As is noted there, such
complements tend to be syntactically truncated, with minimal overt specification of
participants, with the exception of the allative-marked object of a complement (11.7.).
Several sub-types of head-attribute construction are shown in 3. 3(a) stands for the
common construction in which a demonstrative modifies the head; as noted above, and
further discussed in 10.9 below, there is variation is ordering of the elements, but ageneral
tendency for most demonstratives to precede the modified, most of the time. 3(b) stands
for a number of other sub-types, in which an interrogative, indefinite or other qualifier
modifies the head, and there may be some kind of adverbial modifying element. Type
3(c) stands for the possessive phrase, of several particular types as discussed: possessor
expressed by genitive pronoun (tending to precede the head), by dative pronoun
following it, or both together flanking it; or nominal possessor expressed by dativemarking on the possessor and agreement with an independent dative pronoun. Finally, 4
represents a coordinate noun phrase structure which may now be considered briefly.
It is common enough for semantically and syntactically related noun phrases to occur
on separate tone units, each one in some way adding information to the others. For
example, in a myth concerning porcupine, her husband goes out hunting and runs into
some birds, one kind of which, manamanagban (honeyeater?) is explicitly mentioned:
'He caught up to the honeyeaters, they were calling to him'. The tale continues:
(599) ngawurnen
manamanagban
many-ABS
honeyeater-ABS
'Many honeyeaters'244 Chapter 10golorog-bari
peaceful dove-NOMwejbu-ma
mix-PS'together with peaceful doves'.
There is no question that such are to be seen as separate phrases, and indeed the
identification and qualification of participants in separate tone units in this way is a
regular feature of Wardaman texts. Whether phrases in separate tone units refer to the
same entity in different ways, or designate different entities which in many instances may
be construed as having the same role within the text as above, it is out of the question to
regard these as sub-parts of the same phrase.
However, it is also common for nouns to occur together within the same tone unit,
identically case-marked and sharing a participant role, but without overt coordinator. In
fact, there is little evidence of explicit coordination in Wardaman. It would seem that
such elements as the ""focal member of pair"" suffix (5.6.1.) imply coordination, even
though the second member of the pair NEED NOT be explicitly designated, but may be
mentioned (as in the example ngabida-warrma nawurla, see (528) above). Coordination
is achieved simply by juxtaposition, and Type 4 allows for this.

3SG-DISS [now]'She went away from her now foraging for green and black plum'.
A few special issues which relate to coordination are worthy of mention here. There
are some textual examples in which one finds apparently coordinate nouns, identically
marked with case or adverbial ending, but where their having the same grammatical role
within the clause appears counterintuitive. Consider for example in the text Onion, line
30. Here two girls who are preparing food are being cajoled by a man to give him what
they are cooking. One of them hesitates, because of the flirtatious implications of a
woman giving a man cooked food; but the other girl urges her to give it. She does so,
and the man takes the meat, cuts raw onion on top of it, and eats it. The line of interest
is:
(601) anyin-barra
[onion]-ADVlayln-barra
meat-ADV0-ngu-ndi
3SG-eat-PSTgirdibun
finish'He ate the meat and onion up'.
One might expect onion to be marked with the adverbial, comitative ending, for the
idea being conveyed is that he ate the meat WITH onion. But instead, both ""onion"" and
""meat"" are marked with the adverbial ending. Nothing is expressed as direct object.
Consider another example which is different in some respects, but basically similar in
that an unexpected ""spreading"" of case-marking appears to be involved. In the text
Goyin, there is description of bees depositing eggs in the comb. It is said that the honey
body (yi-nyeyn) extends right up to/towards the ""nose"" of the honey-comb. ""Nose"" is
allative-marked (see 5.2.5.). The lines of interest are reproduced below:Issues in constituency and word order 245(602)yi-nyeyn
YI-body-ABSyi-jurn-garr-min
YI-nose-ALL-ADV'The honey body up to/towards the nose'
yi-jum-garr
YI-nose-ALLnan-garr
that-ALLgoyi-warr
honey-ALL'to the nose ofthat honey'.
We might expect the apparent possessor (or whole of which yijurn is a part), goyin
'honey', to be dative marked. Instead we find that it is allative marked like ""nose"".
Another instance of similar kind can be seen in the text Elsie (46) (see also discussion in
10.4. above, insofar as this last example poses questions about ""classifying""
constructions).
These have the appearance of 'coordinate' phrases like the one exemplified in (600),
but present an anomaly in that commonly marked nominals would seem to have different
semantic case roles in the clause. Evidently these are instances of the ""spread"" of caseand adverbial marking across a number of co-occurring nominal constituents.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"Singular-nonsingular subject neutralization. In the combination 3SG
»2SG,
the semantically singular subject is formally marked as nonsingular, and the
difference between this form and that with 3NSG subject category neutralized.
We may now reconsider the distribution of the morpheme gu. As was pointed out in
some speculative historical discussion of gu above, (and now putting aside the suggestion
of its historical, phonologically-conditioned complementarity with ri), the correlation
between gu and nonsingular object marking is not perfect. One case of that lack of
correlation has been otherwise accounted for formally, by the observation concerning 2
object neutralization, above. The only other forms where gu might be expected because
the object is nonsingular, but is not found, are the 3NSG object forms with first or second
person subjects. But we have also observed that all such forms are ""direct"" rather than
""inverse"", and morphologically quite transparent. Considering its absence from direct
combinations regular, we may formulate a statement of the distribution of gu:
4.
Occurrence of gu. In transitive combinations in which the semantic object is
nonsingular, gu occurs between subject and object person markers, ordered in
terms of the ranked categories stated above. Distribution of gu is subject to the
limitation that it does not apply to the combination which has been described as
exhibiting 2 object neutralization, nor to the direct combinations of third NSG
objects with first or second person subjects.
This last pair of restrictions amounts to the observation that gu only occurs in inverse
combinations. A different way of putting this in terms of ordering is that, with the
exception of the form which shows 2 object neutralization, and those with 3SG subject
in which ordering is indeterminate because the subject category is formally zero, gu
occurs in all nonsingular object forms in which the object precedes the subject. The only
exceptions to this, in terms of the occurring ordering, can be the 3NSG object forms with
first and second person subjects.
Now let us consider the distribution of object-marking n. One simple assumption
would be that n occurs after all object markers, including object number markers,
regardless of their ordering. The only exceptions here would be 3SG object forms, which
are morphological zero, and the 1SG
»2SG forms with the object marked by ng.
This is in fact the assumption which underlies certain morpheme segmentations shown
in Table 8, that require special mention.
The assumption has been made that the 2
»1SG forms contain accusative marker
n, by analogy with 2
»1NSG forms, and that degemination reduces this underlying
cluster (see 3.3.). Alternatively, one might assume that no n occurs in these forms, so
that, for example, the underlying 2SG
»1EX NSG string would be /yi-n-gu-ni/,
and that no n occurs to the right of gu, where it results in a cluster n-n. Each way of
viewing the matter has its advantages: the statement of the distribution of n is simplified
by the assumption that it occurs to the right of all object markers. On the other hand, if
we view it as not underlying in those combinations mentioned above, there is no need to
posit underlying geminate clusters n-n.",[155]

"Issues in constituency and word order 259Inclusion of two full clauses within a single tone group is common, although it is
unusual in the narratives collected for a tone group to contain MORE than TWO clauses.

These examples show that, in the textual linking of two full clauses by prosodic means
only, although it often happens that the two finite verbs share an object, or (perhaps better
put) presuppose the same object, they may in fact have different subjects and/or objects.
(629) illustrates different subjects of the two prosodically-Iinked predicates, the linkage
highlighting precisely their opposite direction of movement: as one went down the other
went up. The prosodic linkage of full clauses on a tone unit, then, is an even more
explicitly ""textual"" (rather than ""grammatical"") device than is particle adjunction; for
the latter operates in terms of the sharing of core arguments among all predicate
constituents and the controlling of verbal categories by the finite verb.","[282, 283]"
"Issues in constituency and word order 249Here again ergative marked elements are mainly human: there are four instances of
""father"" or ""my father""; 2 of personal names; 1 ofmarluga Old man'; 1 ofyibiyan 'man,
Aborigines'; and 1 oflinin 'snake'.
In the Onion text there are 5 ergative-marked instances. In two of these both agent and
object present, and the orders are AVO and OVA. The ergative nouns include 2 instances
of a personal name, 2 of ""horse"", and 1 of the dual marked nan-guya-yi 'those two, the
two of them', in reference to two girls.
In the Mejem text there are 23 ergative marked instances, of which 10 are memden
'white man, white people'; 4 are marluga Old man'; 2 are kin terms; 1 is wuja 'fire'; 1
is mulurru Old woman'; 1 is a personal name; 1 is the Proximate demonstrative clearly
referring to an Aboriginal man; 1 is the indefinite yiwarna-mulu-yi referring to 'some
(men)'; 1 is ngawurnen 'many' referring to many people; 1 is nan.ganung-nyi 'these',
referring to people previously named, cited in absolutive case form.
In Mejern, there were 4 instances of ergative-marked agents set off on tone units of
their own, with no V. There were 7 instances in which the direct object was lexically
specified within the same tone unit, allowing as one of these mernde-yi ngan-linyje-rri
yi-jili 'the white man cut my hair'. Here, the object marked by pronominal prefix on the
verb is 1SG, the nominal object is yi-jili 'hair'. Three of the other cases involved lexical
specification of the object of the ditransitive ""give"" construction, e.g., mernde-yi 0-wondi mulurru-wuya 'the whites gave [it] to the two old women'. Of the 7 with object
lexically specified in the same tone unit, orders were as follows: AVO = 3, OVA = 3,
VOA=1.
In the remaining 12 cases of 23, ergative-marked agent occurred before the verb in 7,
and V before A in 4. There was one in which an ergative-marked agent was flanked by
two verbs within the tone unit and was clearly the agent of both: wunggunbu-lawu-rri
mernde-yi \vunggun-bu-ndi 'the whites caught up to them and shot them'. (There were
also other cases of tone units comprising more than one clause, e.g., /[nyanga-ndi yurrba]
[nungguru new me-ndi mernde- yi]l 'he, came and stood and the white manj grabbed hisi
hand'. This was counted above as an instance of OVA).
There is some indication in this material of a tendency for realized agent and object to
be distributed on either side of the verbal word or words. The minor ordering VOA which
brings them together most frequently seems to be associated with textual sequences in
which the verb, normally the ""comment"" on a theme, is being treated as point of departure
for the tone unit as a whole. Of 24 texts searched (long and short), 3 had no ergativemarked nouns or noun phrase at all.","[272, 273]"
"132 Chapter 6The simple statement of the distribution of n as following all object markers requires
equating some occurrences of ng (before velar stop) with the accusative marker, in a way
that is not entirely unproblematic. Considerations are as follows.
With first or second person subject, 3NSG object is marked by wu- and accusative
marker n. In the 3
»3NSG combinations, though, the first element of the prefix
complex has been segmented as wu-ng, where the historical identity of this ng with the
accusative marker n is plausible but not certain. The basic 3NSG object form (with 3
subject) is wunggun-, in which gu is a nonsingular number element, and n the accusative
marker.
In wunggun-, any claim that ng represents an assimilated instance of the accusative
marker is problematic, but cannot be rejected out of hand, based on the following
consideration. There are several other places in the prefix forms where an apparently
comparable ng occurs before nonsingular element gu, including 2NSG
»1EX NSG
yunggunu-, 3SG
»2NSG nunggun-, and 3NSG
>2NSG nunggunburr-.
There are numerous other instances, such as 3SG
»1EX NSG yin.gun- where what
is evidently the accusative marker n does not assimilate before the velar stop of the
nonsingular element gu. However, there is another place in the paradigm in which what
is evidently to be identified as the accusative marker undergoes assimilation, in
3SG
»2SG and 3NSG
>2SG forms (both) yimburr- (2SG yi-, accusative
marker n, and 3NSG subject element wu-rr). Thus assimilation of the accusative marker
elsewhere renders its assimilation before the velar stop plausible, but not to be
unproblematically assumed.
The simplest statement of the distribution of n, with note taken of the fact that it requires
some speculative assumptions as above, would be:
5.
In all transitive combinations with overtly marked objects, with the exception of
1SG
>2SG, the object marker n is inserted after the object pronominal. If
the object is gu marked, n is inserted immediately after gu as well as to the right of
the object pronominal which precedes it.
Thus the assumption is made that some occurring prefixal forms are to be accounted
for by the historical double occurrence of n, now frozen in the prefixal forms. The
principles stated can also be understood generatively, as a way of producing the output
of actually occurring prefixal forms. They need to be ordered with respect to each other
so that the ordering of pronominal elements precedes the distribution of gu. An example
of the way in which the principles form the basis of a derivation is shown below with the
transitive combination 3NSG
»1EX NSG. We assume ordering is the first rule to
apply to the categorial combination:

serves as an index of grammatical function, while the pronominal ordering constraint
serves as an index of hierarchical feature relations between the members of any subjectobject pair.
The pronominal prefix system relies overwhelmingly on relational marking to
distinguish subject and object function, rather than on morphological differentiation of
person marking itself by function. The striking exception to this is the occurrence of a
2SG allomorph -ni- with first person objects. As will now become evident, that marker
belongs to the system of person marking linked with irrealis mood. In just that familiar
area of the transitive paradigm (1
>2 and 2
> 1 combinations) in which formal
representation can be seen to be contested within linguistic systems (see Heath
1976: 188), paradigmatic material is brought over from the marked irrealis mood
category. Differences of the irrealis paradigm from the indicative in person- and other
related prefixal marking will now be summarized.
6.7.3. Irrealis person- and mood-marking
Unlike the initial prefix ya- which occurs in non-past but not past indicative tensemood-aspect forms of the verb (6.6.), irrealis marking as described below remains the
same on non-past and past irrealis forms of the verb. The meanings and uses of the verb
forms are described in 8.9.
The canonical mark of irrealis mood is initial prefix (preceding pronominal elements)
yi- for non-third subject person categories, and ya-yi- for third subject categories.
However, this distinction is not realized in this canonical form in all person-number forms
of the verb: second person subject categories diverge from the pattern, and so do those
forms with first-ordered pronominal element (yi-) representing the person-number
category 1EX NSG, in ways detailed below.

yayi-0-gaygba
yayi-wurr-gaygbaIn Table 9 is given an irrealis paradigm of the verb gayg-ba- 'call to', morphologically
intransitive in that only subject person is marked on the verb. (Any complement ""to
whom"" is Dative-marked; cf. the related, transitive verb gayg-ba-rla- 'to call to'.)
Mood- and person-marking prefixal forms which are distinctive to the irrealis paradigm
are italicized. In sum, they are: yi- for all non-third subject persons except 1EX NSG,134 Chapter 6which has ya- before the person-element yi-; and except 2NSG which has mood/personmarking prefixal form nunu- (preferred) or sometimes yunu·; yayi- for third person
subjects. In addition, the 2SG category has the person-element -ni- following the mood
marker, instead of the indicative-paradigm 2SG subject form yi-.
Obviously, there is an important element of phonological determination in the
deviations from the realization of what was called above the ""canonical"" irrealis pattern.
For example, if the usual 2SG indicative subject element were present, the prefix form
would be: yiyi-. If the usual 2NSG subject marker nu- occurred in this paradigm, we
would presumably find the mood-person marker yi-nu-, segmentally very similar to the
transitive 1EX NSG
>2 combination yinun-. Avoidance of such ambiguities has
probably played some part in the historical structuring of the irrealis paradigm. The fact
of the occurrence of ya- as part of irrealis mood-marking for third person subjects must
presumably be seen in the same light. Compare, for example, the present indicative
2SG
»3SG form 'you are putting it', yi-0-gin, with the structural form that
3SG
»3SG irrealis would have, were it not for the presence of ya- as part of the
irrealis mood marking: *yi-0-0-gi-n. Though 'structurally' different, the two forms
would be homophonous were it not for the presence ofya- as part of the 3 subject irrealis
marker: (pedantically) ya-yi-0-O-gi-n. It is quite probable that the ya- irrealis element
may be identified etymologically with the non-past, third person prefixal form yadiscussed at 6.6. (and this would explain its comparatively anomalous distribution over
tense-aspect categories of the verb, see fn. 7).
The differences of person-mood marking in the irrealis transitive paradigm compared
with the indicative may now be briefly summarized in Table 10. Listed across are
corresponding indicative and irrealis combinations which differ in any respect other than
the presence of initial irrealis mood- marking prefix yi-, or yayi- for third person subject
forms. That is, for example, the indicative 1SG
>3SG combination is nga-, the
corresponding irrealis one yi-nga-. The indicative 3SG
>3SG form is 0- (with
prefix ya- in non-past verbal categories), the corresponding irrealis form prefixed with
mood/person-marker yayi-. All combinations which differ from each other in only these
transparent ways are not listed.

clauses also occurs here with 3SG object; and likewise that the 2NSG person markerIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 135which occurs in intransitive clauses, here occurs with 3SG and 3NSG objects. Now we
may summarize the significance of the occurrence of this 2SG -ni- person element in the
2SG
>1EX NSG and 2NSG
>1EX NSG combinations of the transitive
indicative paradigm. It comes from the irrealis paradigm, and fills in those contested
combinations (again, see Heath 1976) of the transitive paradigm in which 2 person acts
on 1. (In other languages the 1
>2 forms may be equally problematic.) On a scale
of graduated transitivity values of verbal categories, irrealis would probably have to be
considered lower in transitivity than the indicative mood (and the precise justification
for this in Wardaman will emerge in Chapters 8 and 9, where the uses and meanings of
irrealis are discussed; see also Hopper and Thompson 1980). To fill out what are often
problematic categorial combinations in the transitive paradigm, Wardaman has recourse
to formal elements of the less highly transitive irrealis one.9
In Table 10, remaining differences from the indicative consist in the fact that, before
1EX NSG person element >'/- as subject and object, and before the 2SG object element
yim in 3SG/NSG
»2SG the irrealis marker does not consist of yi-, or in the latter
case, of yayi-, but of να-. Another irregularity of the irrealis forms is that 2SG/
NSG
»1EX NSG forms were found not to be distinguished from the indicative
forms.
6.7.4. Habitual aspect- and person-marking
There is an habitual category of the verb (8.10.), the canonical marker of which is an
initial prefix of shape ma-. In many ways the habitual aspect-person prefix forms are
very analogous to the irrealis ones, though there is no reason to see habitual as a semantic
sub-category of irrealis. The habitual person-aspect prefixes as they occur in intransitive
clauses are shown in Table 11 opposite the irrealis ones.

paradigm in the area of 2
»1 and 1
»2 by bringing over of forms from the irrealis or
similar verbal mood category of lesser transitivity, is not a phenomenon limited to Wardaman.
In Jawoyn, for example, the 1SG
»2SG prefix form is etymologically an irrealis moodmarking prefix which is required in third person intransitive forms, and 3
>3 transitive forms.","[155, 156, 157, 158, 159]"

"Issues in constituency and word order 233This tendency is also true of modifiers formed with ""having"" suffix, which in general
tend to follow any open-class nominal with which they occur, e.g., nana marluga
wiya-warang 'the old drunk man'. This tendency is not apparently as strong with the
shorter qualifiers, e.g., nana wi'.du wurren 'the small child' and nana yijad wurren 'the
big child' are perfectly acceptable, as is e.g., nana wurren yijad.
Although the indefinite qualifier yiwarnagari 'a different one, another' is long, it
appears to have considerable freedom of occurrence, pre- or post-nominal, in two-word
and longer noun phrases, e.g. yiwarnagari laglan or laglan yiwarnagari 'another,
different camp'. As noted in 5.9., there is a tendency for the concept of ""difference"" or
otherness to be marked pleonas ically on the nominal as well as by this modifier, and this
appears to happen where thi modifier precedes the nominal, e.g., yiwarnagari
laglan-gari 'a different camp'. It may be noted, also, that when it precedes the nominal
it may occur in a shortened form, minus -gari: yiwarna bangbun 'another woman',
yiwarna wiyan 'next year, another year'. The latter phrase is in fact standard in the
meaning 'next year, next rainy season'. (One does not standardly find yiwarna wiyangari as a set phrase.) Yiwarnagari invariably follows any occurring demonstrative.

An example of a noun phrases with pronominal head (""me"") and further specification
of location is:
(563) jumba
behindjingi
sitnganunya
1SG-DISSbanggin-ya
back-LOC'Sit behind me/at my back'.
Alternatively, a meaning of ι he above sort may be constructed with a nominal head
(""back"") and possessive pronoun (here an independent dative one):
(564) jumba
behindnga-jim>i-ndi
ISG-sii-PSTgo
3SG-DATbanggin-ya
back-LOCΊ sat behind him/at the back of him'.
Both pronominal and nominal heads in the two examples above occur in relation to but
separate from the adverbial jumba 'behind' , and it is common for only adverbial and verb
to occur (jumba jingi 'sit behind'). See 10.4. for further discussion of possession.
Some three-word noun phrases have already been illustrated in examples above, and
it should be clear that they are lot uncommon, although certainly they are textually less
frequent than two- or one-word ones. Common enough types include those with
demonstrative, open-class noriinal and semantically adjectival nominal (nana mayin
me-belbelin 'the/that round vegetable food'), and those with genitive pronominal first in234 Chapter 10the phrase followed by nominal and qualifier, where the order of the latter two is
apparently not fixed but depends on other factors. For example, one may encounter
nganinggin yiwarlng yibirrba or nganinggin yibirrba yiwarlng 'my old clothes', where
the condition-of-use qualifier shows the flexibility of ordering we have already noted for
many (apparently relatable to the length of the modifying word). However, as we have
already noted, collective-marked demonstratives strongly tend to follow any nominal
with which they occur, and this was found to always be the case in such examples in
phrases of more than two words: nganinggin yiwarlng dan-ganung 'my clothes, these
clothes of mine'.
Expansions of simpler noun phrase types are possible with the occurrence of adverbials
and inflected nouns which elaborate the reference of an adjectival or open-class nominal,
or number word functioning as phrasal head. Such adverbials and embedded phrases
often express such notions as origin or source, for example:
(565)gangma-wunba
kangaroo-SOU-AB Syi-nebel
ΥΙ-shoulder bone-ABS'The shoulder bone of/from a kangaroo'.
(566) gorro-wunba-wuya
south-SOU-DU-ABSguyamin
two-ABS'The pair of them from the south'.
Somewhat uncommonly, such elaborations may result in phrases of up to four words
occurring on one tone unit, rarely more than that:
(567)yiwarnagari
other-ABSdawung-jila
thatway-ORIGgorro-wunba
south-SOUbangbun
woman-ABSΆ foreign woman from that way to the south'.
Some definite ordering tendencies within the phrase may be given as follows:
(1) in noun phrases with pronominal head (such as yirrug-bulu yi-nimanyug-bulu 'we
EXCL people of Nimanyug') the pronominal occurs initially, followed by any modifier,
including number word.
(2) in non-pronominal noun phrases, demonstratives generally occur preceding any
nominal, except as noted in the case of the collective-marked demonstrative forms, which
strongly tend to follow any occurring nominal. Also, number words (especially those
from one to three) tend to precede any nominal with which they occur, but this is a much
weaker tendency than the former. Genitive pronouns tend to precede the nominal they
modify, but this too is a weaker tendency than the first.
(3) other modifiers — roughly, adjectival ones — tend to follow the modified nominal;
but certain very common ones of three syllables or less appear to have greater freedom
of ordering, either preceding or following the modified nominal.
See also below some discussion of ordering in the possessive phrase (10.4.), in ""classifier""
or generic-specific constructions (10.5.), in the negated noun phrase (10.6.); and in
discontinuous phrases (10.7.).","[256, 257, 258]"
"126 Chapter 63SG subject is 0-. Several forms (1EX, UN PL, 3NSG) show a nonsingular (subject)
element -rr-, just as the same categories do in the free pronouns. However, this element
cannot be neatly identified synchronically as a ""nonsingular"" marker (i.e., of a category
which does not distinguish dual and plural) because of the UN PL form, which must be
regarded as explicitly ""plural"" because it contrasts, formally and semantically, with the
UN DU prefix category. The same categories as in the free pronouns (1EX, 2NSG,
3NSG) may properly be regarded as ""nonsingular"" in that dual and plural are not
distinguished (in a morphologically primary way, though dual may be distinguished by
suffixation to the verb, as described in 5.6.2.).
2NSG unexpectedly fails to exhibit the number element -rr-, and thus marks 2NSG
person/number in a more synthetic fashion than the other categories.
The l IN DU form is seemingly transparent, identifiable with ISGnga-, combined with
a 2SG element -yi-.

some may not appear so. Let us outline the morphemes that represent the various person
categories.
Third person singular subject and object are everywhere zero. By comparison with
third person NSG object -wu- which always follows first and second person subject
marker (e.g., 1SG
>3NSG) one may, in attempting to simplify an eventual
statement of the significance of relative ordering, assume that 3SG object always follows
first and second person categories also.
3NSG object is wu- in combinations where the subject is first or second person. These
combinations always show the ordering S-O (subject-object). In combinations where
object is 3NSG and subject a third person, we find that what may be identified as an
object marker wu- appears first in the prefix complex, followed by a nonsingular object
marker gu (see further), and then subject marker for the third person category, e.g.,
3NSG
»3NSG /wu-n-gu-n-wu-rr/. Therefore in these combinations 3NSG object
is (partly) expressed by -wu-, as in combinations with first and second person subjects,
but order is inverted to O-S.
First person singular subject is always nga-. First person singular object is everywhere
represented by nga- followed by an accusative marker n and then subject pronominal.","[149, 150, 151]"

The structure of possessive loun phrases is discussed in 10.4. Where possession is
expressed by genitive pronoun modifying the nominal, the order pronoun-nominal is
most common in the textual corpus. However, here again the opposite order, though less
common, is certainly well attes :ed. In (551) the most common order is illustrated; in (552)

Of the many other qualifiers which specify properties or characteristics of entities (e.g.,
of size, shape, colour, texture, condition of use, taste etc.), it may be suggested that word
length may have something to do with ordering freedom with respect to a modified
nominal. It is in any event noticeable that several short modifiers (ones of no more than
two syllables, e.g., -jad 'big', \vudu 'little', and -man 'good') may apparently occur
indifferently before or after tht modified nominal, for example:

"10.9. Variant ordering in DEM + N phrases
In 10.3 it was said that the most common ordering of demonstrative and specified noun
is DEM + N. It was also noted that such phrases containing the forms of the Proximate
demonstrative nana are of particularly high frequency, since that category has the
function of signaling the textual recoverability of the entity, and is perhaps most
comparable to the English definite article (see 7.2. for illustration). But recoverability in
general does not completely coincide with the identification in context of which
particular recoverable entity is being referred to. Let us consider some instances of the
variant order with the Proximate category, N + DEM, since it would appear to be
associated with and one of the means of clarifying which recoverable or given noun
phrase within the information unit is meant, by signalling a break in the flow.
In certain instances where two protagonists have been spoken about, the variant order
seems to be associated with a shift from one to the other.
In the Onion text, line 65 we have an instance of marluga nana. Two men have been
discussing the illness of one of them who ate food prepared by two girls. The other man
suggests to him that he has been ensorcelled, and he agrees. ""I dreamt about them"" (63),
""about the two of them giving me onion, he says"" (64). At that point the other old man
calls out to the girls and tells them to rub the victim with fat. It is at that point in line
(65) that the phrase in question occurs, and appears to be associated with a transition
from the speaker quoting the victim, to the other old man asserting his authority over the
girls and telling them to cure him. Note that the ""other"" old man re-introduced at this
point is grammatically the subject of an intransitive verb (""call to"") which takes dative
complement.
In the text Mejern, between lines (93) and (98) there is a similar shift in transition
between two recoverable characters. An old Aboriginal man identified as the father of246 Chapter 10Micky Bennett was hiding along the river (92) and saw a white man shooting Aborigines
(93). For several dozen lines the speaker has been talking about shooting by whites, not
individually identifiable but only known as associated with local stations. A chief interest
of this part of the story is the identifiability of particular Aborigines and their exploits in
the face of European violence. Having seen the white (or whites) shooting (93), the old
Aboriginal man spears his horse out from under him (94-97), and he falls. Line (98)
begins with the variant order memden nana, perhaps associated with the transition from
the previous few lines in which the old Aboriginal man is the assumed agent (ellipsed in
97). A similar shift occurs between about lines (99) and (104). In (99), the old Aborigine
runs up to the white and stabs him, ""with a tommyhawk"" (100), ""stab"" (101), and runs
away up on top (of the hills) (102-103). Line 104 says: mernden nana gud gajurri 'the
white man stood up'. That is, both are recoverable as nana signals, but I hypothesize that
the variant order may be associated with the signalling of a shift among recoverable items,
specifically to one that has receded slightly into the narrative background.","[269, 270]"
"6.2. Independent pronouns: Base forms
In Wardaman, as in Wakiman (Cook 1987, Chapter 5), a basic distinction is to be made
between what may be called ""base"" and ""general oblique"" (6.3.) free pronominal
categories. ""Base"" forms are the foundational forms of two case categories in free
pronouns. With zero inflection to the base, they fill Absolutive case-functions; that is,
they serve in intransitive subject and transitive object functions within the clause, in
conjunction with the obligatory pronominal prefixes which mark these categories in the
verb. With Ergative inflection, base forms fill transitive subject function within the
clause, in conjunction with the pronominal prefixes marking this function. Thus two case
categories, Absolutive and Ergative, that from the point of view of case-marking in the
noun serve quite different functions, from the perspective of (historical) pronominal
morphology differ principally by outer inflection. A plausible historical inference may
be that the distinction between Absolutive and Ergative categories in the free pronouns
on the base pronominal series may be a relatively recent development.
In the base pronouns and elsewhere in the person-marking system, there is no formal
distinction between dual and plural in the person categories lEX(clusive), and 2NSG
(nonsingular); there is a single form which may optionally be dual-suffixed (see 5.6.2.)
in order to make a distinction between dual and plural, but this is morphologically
secondary. In addition, there is generally no formal distinction between dual and plural
in third person categories of all kinds (i.e., neither in demonstratives, nor in the
pronominal prefixes in the verb).
Though there are thus simply 'nonsingular' pronominal base forms in 1EX, 2NSG and
3NSG categories, there are also to be distinguished first and second person singular base
forms, a 1 Dual category, and a 1 Inclusive Nonsingular category. Leaving aside third
person forms entirely for the moment, the base pronominal forms in 1 and 2 person
categories are:108 Chapter 61
1EX
2Singular
ngayngii
—
yinyangDual
yawimg-guya
—Nonsingular
ngarrug
yirrug(guya)
nur rug (guy a)1SG is ngoyugu, 2SGyinyang. Clearly the notion of ""inclusion"" does not apply to
1SG, but only to forms that signal 1SG + 2. There are three nonsingular categories that
all belong to one form class in the sense that they all exhibit a final syllable -rrug, where
the rr (based on this, and evidence from the pronominal prefixes in the verb) is clearly
to be taken as a nonsingular element. However, ngarrug has a different status from the
other two in that it is inherently more than dual, and cannot be suffixed for dual number.
It contrasts with UN DU yawung-guya, which (based on evidence from the general
oblique or Dative form) appears to have a stemyawu- with epenthetic nasal before the
dual suffix. The forms 1EXNSG yirrug and 2NSG nitrrug may optionally be
dual-suffixed to explicitly indicate dual number, for as noted there is no difference
between dual and plural categories in 1EX, 2NSG and 3NSG pronominals in the verb.
1EXNSG and 2NSG pronouns may also be plural-suffixed (5.6.3.): yirrug-bulu,
mirrug-bulu.
The Ergative free pronouns are transparently built on the stems given above by
suffixation of the usual Ergative marker:1

ngayug-ji
yinyang-nyiDual

—Nonsingular
ngarrug-ji
yirrug-ji
nurrug-jiWith Ergative suffix UN DU form isyawung-guya-yi. The 2NSG and 1EXNSG forms
may, of course, be dual suffixed nurrug-(g)icya-yi andyirrug-(g)uya-yi. A few minor
remarks on the realization of some of these forms are required.
Although careful pronunciation reveals ngayug-ji as 1SG ERG form, common
realizations include [ngayig-ji}t and ones in which the velar stop loses a great deal of its
occlusive quality, and may be deleted altogether, up to and including [ngayiji]. And
though careful pronunciation reveals (Absolutive) 2SG yinyang, there is a strong
tendency for the α to be raised and fronted following the high front vowel and palatal
nasal, so that a common realization is \yinyeng]. Finally, though the 1EXNSG ABS and
ERG forms yirrug and yirrug-ji are realized with second vowel as it, with the addition
of the dual suffix there is a tendency for the second vowel to lose its rounding and to
assimilate in frontness to the first vowel, yielding realizations approximating
\yirriguyoyi],
Absolutive pronouns in the function of transitive object of a predicate occur in
conjunction with object pronominal prefixes in the verb marking the object; absolutive
pronouns in the function of intransitive subject, and Ergative pronouns in the function of
transitive subject, occur in conjunction with subject pronominals in the verb. Reflexive
and reciprocal constructions, as is true for other kinds of nominals, require that their
subjects be expressed by Absolutive forms of the independent pronouns.","[131, 132]"
"236 Chapter 10While genitive pronoun may occur as sole word above standing for the ellipsed
nominal, it would not produce an acceptable sentence for the dative pronoun to occur
alone. Thus, in such doubled constructions (gungan.gin gunga 'his' etc.), the dative
pronoun is evidently syntactically dependent upon the genitive one.
Where the possessor is nominal, it is usual if not universal for possession to be marked
both on the nominal possessor by suffixation of dative case, and further within the phrase
by the appropriate form of the dative independent pronoun (as illustrated in 5.2.3.). Thus,
for example:
(573) jarrug
egg-ABSgo
3SG-DATgalawarra-wu
spinifex pigeon-DAT'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon'.
(574) giminy-gu
[name]-DATgo
3SG-DATyibiwi
father-ABS'Gimiyn's father'.
(575)mulurru-wuya-wu
old woman-DU-DATyiguyu
mother-ABSwurrugu-wuya
3NSGDAT-DU'The mother of the two old women'.
As the above two examples illustrate (see also 5.2.3.), the possessor nominal may occur
either before or after the head noun. Further, the position of the dative pronoun is not
strictly fixed: it may occur following the possessed head noun, or following the dativemarked possessor noun. Because of its ordering freedom, it may sometimes occur at some
remove from the dative-marked possessor noun with which it agrees:
(576) yurnvarla-wu
[ss]-DATyimbanay
[ssJ-ABSyi-ngawuyu
YI-wife-ABSgo
3SG-DAT'Yurrwarla's wife is yimbanay' [i.e., for a male of yurrwarla subsection, the
appropriate wife category is yimbanay].
In 5.2.3. it was shown that the possessor of a possessor is also dative-marked (e.g.,
my-DAT mother's-DAT dog), and that particularly the nominal dative-marked possessor
tends to show agreement with a dative independent pronoun as well; also, that a
dative-marked possessor cannot be further inflected for case function within the clause.
Such further case function can be marked only on the possessed head of the nominal
phrase: ""my-DAT mother's-DAT dog-ERG (bit me)"", and the like.
A few cases turned up in the corpus of collected texts which seem to suggest that
sometimes, a construction which is apparently semantically possessive can be formed
simply by juxtaposition of the possessed and possessor nominals, viz.:
(577) nana
that-ABSbuda
black plum-ABS'The juice of the black plum'.yingilga
juice-ABSIssues in constituency and word order 237In considering certain similai constructions in Gooniyandi, McGregor (1990:253) has
suggested that they may be reg;irded not as possessive phrases, but as classifying ones, in
which the head noun is classified by type (in the above example, ""juice"" as of the specific
type ""plum juice""). It is attractive to consider such phrases as of some kind other than
possessive, because they differ from the usual possessive construction types. However,
several comments need to be made about this proposal for Wardaman. First of all, the purely
syntactic process of juxtaposition seems not to be highly productive: such examples as the
above stand out in the corpus as exceptions. There are however a few instances in which kin
relations, normally expressed by the usual kinds of possessive constructions, are simply
indicated by juxtaposition of the possessor to the kin term. Compare, for example, in the text
Gawalyan lines (50) and (55). The first is the expected kind of nominal possessive
construction: mulurru-wu bailet-gu yiguyu go Old woman Violet's mother', with third
person dative independent prc noun agreeing with the possessor (see next section for
discussion of phrases such as ""old woman X""). But in line (55) we find simply: dorij
bauet yiguyu wurruguya 'Dois and Violet's mother' with third person nonsingular
independent dative pronoun, and no dative marking on the possessor nominals, the two
personal names. Since this is not very common, it is probably best considered not a regular
kind of possessive construction, but an instance where the two personal names of those
readily understood to be the possessors are simply apposed to the possessed noun.
Second, there are some fairly regular types of juxtaposition of what might be described
as generic and specific terms. Some of these seem to show a quite regular, even strict,
ordering, while others do not. These will be at least mentioned, if not analyzed, in 10.5.
Finally, mention must be made of the typical syntactic treatment of body parts. Body
parts may function as arguments in all of the usual clause types, and may be marked by
pronominal prefix on the verb in their own right. For example, in a text about a fight
which developed between emu and brolga, there lies an explanation of why each of those
birds has its particular characteristics. Brolga savagely clobbered emu's two hands, so
that they are now small wings, and emu is flightless. One line says:
(578) nungguru-wan
hand-ABS-DFyanja
3-3SG-go-PRESgo
3SGDATwudu
littlewudu
littlena_
[now]'And her hands [wings are very small now'.
In (578), nunggum is the intransitive subject of the verb ""go"", which means in context
""become"" or ""have become"". Further on, emu retaliates, and meaning is expressed in
such a way that the body part she strikes is treated as direct object, and even more fully
concretized by addition of the uticle suffix:
(579) gabarri
againgumurtinji-yi
emu-ERG0-bu-ndi-ya
3SG-hit-PST-NARyi-bam-bi
YI-head ABS-ART'And then emu hit her head'.
nana
that-ABSyi-bam
YI-heai-ABS'And her head is red'.yanja
3SG-go-PRESgo
yi-belyangman
3SG-DAT YI-red-ABS238 Chapter 10There is no overt expression of possession here, and with the salience of body parts in
the narrative it is quite possible for them to function in their own right as intransitive
subjects of the verb ""go"", here meaning ""to be characteristically"".
It is perhaps more usual, however, for body parts to function syntactically in a way that
links them more directly with their owners.
Consider a common circumstance in which a body part is the direct object of an action.
The third person object is not cross-referenced on the verb; it is realized by an
independent absolutive noun. The possessor is indicated on the verb, in the sort of
construction illustrated in (580):
(580) ngan-linyje-rri
3SG-cut-PSTyi-jili
YI-hair-ABS'He cut my hair' ['he cut me hair'].
In such an instance the ""hair"" is in the same role as its possessor, and I will regard such
cases as ones of possessive NP with pronominal possessor and nominal possessed, with
the possibility of realisation on the verb of the former only.
There are certain characteristic expressions, largely of mental action or disposition, in
which a body part is the indispensable adjunct in the creation of the particular meaning:
(581) yi-gulan
YI-ear-ABSnga-we-ndi
ISG-fall-PSTΊ forgot'.
These are not possessive constructions of the same kind as ""my hair"" (580), for
absolutive yi-gulan 'ear' is idiomatically combined as adjunct with the verb we- to create
the meaning 'forget'. Similarly:
(582) mejern
stomach-ABSya-wud-jingi-n
3-3NSG-be/sit-PRESlud-ba
happy'They are happy'.
Absolutive mejern 'belly, stomach' as adjunct of the particle plus AUX construction
ludba and jingi yields the meaning 'be happy'. Again, this is not a possessive
construction.
There are instances of possession where a possessed body part is not in a major syntactic
function and thus cannot be marked on the verb, for example, in an intransitive
construction such as:
(583) 0-we-ndi
3SG-fall-PST(nganu)
(3SG-DAT)nganinggin-ya
1SGGEN-LOCyi-bam-nya
YI-head-LOC'It fell [on me] on my head'.
Here the possessive phrase consists minimally of pronominal possessor marked by
independent genitive pronoun and possessed nominal.","[259, 260, 261, 262]"
"The reflexive-reciprocal is used to express action where subject and object are identical,
including action upon oneself, and in this is similar to certain uses of the English
reflexive-reciprocal category. However, typically action of certain (largely negatively
evaluated?) kinds, such as fighting and swearing, are formulated with use of an ordinary
predicate made reflexive-reciprocal. Thus, for example, the typical way of saying that
people are fighting is to say, ya-wurr-bu-yi-n, literally 'they are hitting each other'. A
further example of this kind is the formally reflexive-reciprocal verb nge-yi- 'argue',
from transitive nge- 'call'. It seems that the meanings of these verbs should not be taken
too literally (e.g., as ""hit each other"", ""call each other""), but should rather be seen as a
kind of grammatical metaphor, or a typical way of formulating certain kinds of action.
The sentence ngamanda-wunya ya-wurr-nge-yi-n is approximately the equivalent of
English ""What are they arguing about?"", rather than the more literal ""What are they
calling each other (for)?"" A few textual examples of the reflexive-reciprocal category
follow:
(437)ngabulu-wan
breast-ABS-DF0-ginye-yi-rri
3SG-cook-RR-PSTgunga
3SG-DAT'And she cooked her breasts for him ...'
(437) refers to the customary practice of warming one's breasts in the heat of a fire in
order to begin and enhance milk-flow. Note that there is an independent Absolutive
nominal object in a part- whole relation to the subject of the predicate.
(438)ngabulu
breast-ABSjHyjiyl
squeeze0-me-yi-rri
3SG-AUX-RR-PSTjabalawarna-ya
flat
rock-LOC'She expressed her milk onto the flat rock'.
Here again, the ""breast"" which is part of the whole pronominal adjunct is treated as
Absolutive object, with reflexive-reciprocal expression of the action-on-self in the
predicate.

finishnan-ba-wan

be slightly more cases in which the number word precedes the nominal. This tendency
is most noticeable in respect to the number words lege One', guyamin 'two', and
murrgun 'three'; whereas in phrases with nominal modified by ngawurnen 'many', the

The verb may consist of a single inflected word, or an inflected word in construction with
a ""verb particle"" (Chapter 11). Minimally, the inflected verb carries pronominal
reference to one participant, maximally to two. Such participants may or may not be
realized lexically. The verbal word or words may of course be modified by adverbials.
Because the verb carries pronominal specification, it is inherently complex syntactically,
and may stand by itself as a complete clause.","[273, 274, 275]"
"It has also been mentioned (5.9.) that the notion of ""difference"" given by -gari tends
to be expressed pleonastically, in that it and the adjectival nominal of word rank,
yiwarnagari 'another, (a) different (one)' often occur in the same tone unit and phrase:
(531)nana
that-AB Syiwarnagari
other-ABSyibiyan-gari

Noun phrases of two words are not uncommon. The following types are usual.
DEM + N. The various closed classes of demonstrative words (see 7.2.) function to
contextualise the phrase, relating it to the linguistic or extralinguistic context, thus
specifying reference:Issues in constituency and word order 229(532) dami yibiwan'yonder man'(533) dang-ba wujaba-wa'from yonder house'Of the three demonstrative categories (dana, nana, darni, which designate things as
Immediate, Proximate or Remote with respect to the speech situation), in many instances
the Proximate category signals linguistic recoverability, i.e., that an item is being
presented as known or recoverable from the linguistic context (whether it has actually
been previously mentioned or not). Thus the Proximate category is most comparable in
English to the definite article, and two-word noun phrases consisting of Proximate
demonstrative and open-class nominal are very common:
(534)nana gangman'the kangaroo'(535) nan-gu marluga-wu'to/for the old man'(536) nanajulu'the/that hill' etc.","[252, 253]"

The purposive forms are derived, respectively, from mediopassive jomarna- 'finish

It is interesting that often, informants would add overt Dative suffix to such Purposive

barlirrgbi-yin 'in order to sweep, clear'; gardbu-ye-ma and gardbu-yin 'in order to wipe'.
There were a number of verbs for which informants would produced or approve a -yin
Purposive form, but not a -ye-ma one, including: worlorl-mi-yin 'to fill', but not
*worlorlma-ye-ma (or any variant thereof); dagbarla-yin 'to have' but not *dagbarlaye-ma. This would seem to suggest the -ye-ma construction is less, current and
productive.
11.4.3. Allative-marked complements of purpose, intention and goal
Both Allative and Source case categories have somewhat different syntactic distribution
with complements built from finite verbs (nominalized), as compared to particle
complements.
As complements of verbs of motion, particles typically occur either with no suffix, or
with Dative suffix, to express ""purpose for which"". A small number of particles and
particle-like forms occur with no suffix in combination with verbs of motion, expressing
purpose; and any objective argument is Dative-marked. Of this kind is the common form
jarrambu 'looking for, in search of, etymologically related to the finite \erbjarram-bu-:

It is very common in Wardamaa for people to be referred to in terms of membership of
a gender/age category. The mail commonly used gender/age-set terms are niarluga ' old
man' and nmlurru Old woman'. These, then, are generic terms which identify by the
gender/age- s et to which someone belongs, and individuals may be more closely
identified by juxtaposition of a personal name. The overwhelmingly common order is:
age-set term followed by perso lal name. Thus:
(584) niarluga berru
Old man Berru'.
(585) nnihirru yidawim
' Old woman Yidawun'.
Persons may also be specified by subsection term. Usually, the subsection term occurs
as sole lexeme of a phrase, aid thus there is no internal syntax. However, textual
examples have been found which show that when part of a more elaborate identifying
phrase, subsection terms occur between age-set term and personal name, thus:
(586) niarluga yurrwarla dulu
' Old man Dulu of yumvarla subsection'.
Persons may also be specified by gender/age-set term followed by a kin term, usually
one designating someone as kinsman from the speaker's perspective, thus:
(587) niarluga gagung
Old man grandfather' | father's father].
It might be suggested that ir the above cases, we are dealing with constructions of
generic and specific terms, in Jiat order: the age-set (and subsection) terms designate
most generally, the personal names and kin terms specifically.
Though it would not seem tha: there is a highly generalized Generic + Specific sy ntagm
operating widely over the nominal domain, certain other typical constructions may be
noted It is reasonably comiron for certain kinds of animals to be designated by a
construction which includes ths generic lexeme lay in 'meat, animal'. It would appear
that either Generic-Specific or Specific-Generic order may occur, e.g., either gaiignian
layin or layin gangnian 'kangaroo'. A textual example occurs in which the speaker is
describing the kinds of things she and others used to eat when young, as opposed to
European foods:

3SG-DAT that-DAT

pigeon-DATlany-gu
animal-DAT240 Chapter 10See (653) for a textual example of the order layin gangman. There are examples of the
generic mayin 'vegetable food' occurring with specific terms, with similar freedom or
ordering. And there are scattered other examples of what may or may not be semantically
generic-specific phrases, for example within a single tone group the following:
(589) yi-munburra
money-ABS0-wo-ndi
3SG-give-PSTdangindi
paperbark-ABS'He gave him his money'.
In context, it was evident that the particular contribution of dangindi, otherwise the
generic term for 'paperbark' and today used also to mean 'paper', was to make clear that
a particular station worker was paid off by being written a cheque, i.e., not money in
general, but paper (dangindi) that, exceptionally, is a kind of money (specifically, of >'/type as opposed to generic wumunburra 'money'). Possibly in other contexts
yimunburra dangindi might also be able to refer to 'paper money' (that is, it is likely that
""cheque"" and ""paper money"" might be referred to in the same way, as opposed to generic
wumunburra 'money'). In any case, it is unclear given the semantic contribution of the
noun class prefix yi- that we are dealing with a generic-specific construction of a kind
comparable to any of those discussed above. We may be dealing with a construction in
which yimunburra and dangindi are more or less semantically equivalent within the
linguistic context, where meanings were plainly being made about paying off a worker
with money. The above remarks on generic-specific and possibly related constructions
are obviously illustrative and suggestive rather than analytic.","[262, 263, 264]"
"1.3. Linguistic type
Wardaman is both prefixing and suffixing. It has relatively complex nominal and verbal
morphology. There are three overt nominal class markers (yi-, ma- and WM-), at least the
first two of which are used to designate fairly unified sets of denotata. Most noun stems
occur only with prefix of one particular class (e.g., yi-biyan 'man, person, Aborigine');
but some may occur with more than one, producing lexical difference (yi-mum 'eye',
wu-mum 'nipple'). As well, there are many nouns which occur without prefix (i.e., with
0- prefix), but with which modifiers (adjectival nouns) may exhibit overt concord.
Number and case are marked by suffixes, and the syntactic case system tends to be
fairly strongly Ergative-Absolutive. However, there is wide use of a clause type with
actor subject (not generally Ergatively-marked if represented by an independent
nominal), and objective complement marked by Dative case. As well, there are various
one-place (fully intransitive) clause types. Overt suffix categories include
Ergative/Instrumental, Dative/ Genitive, local cases Allative, Locative and Ablative, and
the semantically most restricted local category, Originative. In addition, there are two
morphologically composite case categories, historically built on the Dative. The first,
an historical composite of Dative plus Locative, is termed Dissociative, and usually
expresses the meaning ""from"" or ""away from"" of an animate participant, or ""on account
of of a wider range of participant types. The second, historical composite of Dative and
Ablative, expresses a range of notions including source and cause, and is labelled Source.
Participants are obligatorily marked by pronominal prefixes in the verb, and
secondarily by independent pronouns. A maximum of two participants are indicated in
the verb by transitive prefix forms that tend to be portmanteaux, i.e., not neatly
segmentable into parts representing each person/number that enters into the combination.
In the expression of verbal meanings, there is a basic distinction between inflecting
verbs and what I have called free verb ""particles"". It is common in linguistic descriptions
for the word ""particle"" to be used to designate non-inflecting parts of speech. In
Wardaman what I call ""particles"" can take some inflections. The term ""particle"" in this
sense, however, has had currency in Australianist studies for some time (see Dixon ed.
1976), and I retain it, but place emphasis on describing the possibilities of inflection, and
the important syntactic functions of these elements. ""Verb particles"" are semantically
full, and occur in combination with a small number of high-frequency inflecting roots
(including a number of significant ones of shape CV). Where such particle and verb
combinations are highly regular in a specific verbal meaning, the construction is
generally labelled that of Particle plus Auxiliary in this description. However, it isIntroduction 5significant that here, seemingly more than in some other regional languages which have
this general construction type (e.g., Mangarrayi), the ""AUX"" often transparently has
some clear semantic commonality with the particle, and thus cannot be regarded simply
as a formal mechanism or bearer of inflections. For example, with the particle gayardung
'run', most common are the motion verbs ya- 'go' and nyanga- 'come'. These of course
partly function as grammatical ""auxiliaries"", in that they bear person and verbal
categorial inflections; but transparently, they are semantically integral with the particle.
The clear kind of semantic integration in this case contrasts with that, say, between the
particle wululu and its usual ""AUX"" we-, which may occur by itself in the meaning 'fall,
be born'. However, together, the combination wululu we- means 'enter, go inside' (not
""fall in"" or the like). That is, there is no clear semantic ""transparency"" of the AUX in
the latter case, and thus a greater idiomaticity to the combination than to those with
gayardung. Thus, the label Particle plus AUX is applied to combinations which may
differ considerably in their internal semantic relations. The diverse nature of
combinations within this construction type is clearly of comparative interest, and this
labelling should not by any means disguise the fact that, as noted above, ""AUX"" is a
semantically and functionally flexible, diverse and problematic category.
Particles have a wide syntactic range. They may be inflected for nominal categories
(case), and occur in non-predicative construction types as nominals, and as modifiers.
Paradigms of inflecting verbs tend to be highly regular: there is a very limited amount
of suffixal allomorphy for tense/aspect/mood categories. The one thoroughly irregular
paradigm is that of the verb ""to go"".
Suffixal categories of the verb include Present, Past, Future, and Potential, that is,
express tense and in some instances, tense/mood meanings. An Admonitive (""lest"")
construction is generally built on a zero-stem form, or is built on the Future stem in the
few verbs where this is a formally distinct (and obviously historically moribund)
category. Further tense/aspect meanings (e.g., iterative) are expressed by additional
suffixation to verb forms inflected for tense/aspect, and in some instances (Habitual) by
special prefix forms.
A basic mood distinction between Realis and Irrealis categories is expressed by verbal
prefixation, in combination (in some instances) with differences in the bound pronominal
forms which express person/number as between the two mood categories.
Weak subordination of one predication to another is a common means of constructing
discourse linkage in Wardaman. There are two sets of subordinators, one expressing
non-past, the other past, temporal reference. Another important mechanism of textual
cohesion is ""de-focusing"" of overtly occurring NPs, i.e., marking of them as recoverable
and thus cohesive with surrounding linguistic context.
Three deictic ""degrees"" are distinguished in the demonstrative system, with some
irregularity in the paradigms. The spatially intermediate category (not ""this""and not
""yonder"", but proximate ""that"") also serves to indicate textual recoverability, and is thus
most closely comparable to the English definite article.
There are five main points of articulation of parallel stop-nasal series: labial, apicoalveolar, apico-domal or retroflex, lamino-palatal, and velar. There are laterals at three
of these points of articulation, apico-alveolar, apico-domal, and lamino-palatal. The6 Chapter 1lamino-palatal lateral has a very limited distribution. There are retroflex glide and tap
alveolar rhotics. While there are five vowels /, e, u, o and a, the mid-vowels do not
occur in any of the inflectional morphology, except as the result of low-level assimilatory
processes. The mid-vowels do, however, occur in a small number of important
derivational morphemes, and they occur freely in the wider lexicon.
There are no vowel clusters in Wardaman, and no vowel-initial morphemes besides the
tag-question particle ale 'isn't that so?'.
There appears to be little intra-language variation, but minor differences in a few lexical
items were noted among speakers.
Like Warlmanpa to the south (see Nash 1990), Wardaman speak of different territorial
sub-groupings, to which recruitment is normatively in the male line, as having different
madin 'languages', or 'words'. Each such identifiable grouping is said to have
minimally one, sometimes more, special words that are ""their"" language. Typically, these
are said to be either the sound made by, or the language spoken by, principal mythological
figures saliently associated with given Wardaman sub-territories. For example, an
important mythological association with the sub-country just west of Willeroo Station
homestead running westerly to Garnawala (Mount Hogarth) is gulirrida 'peewees',
which are abundantly represented in some of the spectacular rock paintings in this area.
The ""language"" or ""word"" of the peewees, and therefore of the grouping of people
patrifiliated to this area, is said to be mamundajgani, a form for which no etymology can
be given. A few of the ""words"" for particular sub-groupings may have etymologies in
other languages of the Victoria River area. At least one is clearly onomatopoetic (e.g.,
standardization of a bird cry). Knowledge of this kind of relation among people, territory
and salient ""word"" or ""words"" is limited to older people. The madin 'words' about which
there appeared to be wide agreement were: mamundajgani, cited above; ngagandoroj,
the ""word'Of menngen 'white cockatoo', a major dreaming around the Innesvale Station
homestead area; yidabu and wamanga, words associated with warrija 'crocodile'
dreaming, localized at Mt. Gregory; and nenene, a ""word' (imitative of a bird cry) of
bulyan 'eagle', associated with Jalad, or Price's Creek, area. The words associated with
""crocodile"" are interesting, and either have etymologies in other Victoria River
languages, or apparently in any case connote the meanings ""beef, meat"" and ""hit, strike""
(Wardaman deb 'hit, belt' was used to gloss wamanga), both principal elements of the
myth associated with Mt. Gregory, the principal characters of which, Warrura and
Barnangga, fought over a catch of crocodile. In addition, a dilygun 'possum' dreaming
associated with the high country along Mathison Creek is characterized by a particular
style of speaking, with stopped nasal segments similar to the speech of a person trying
to talk with a blocked nose. Thus, possum says dadadi instead of danani 'this one'.
Asked about these ""languages"" or ""words"", people will emphasize that they are all ""one"",
the ""same Wardaman"", that is, are socio-territorial distinctions made by people who share
a common language in the linguist's usual sense.
Among other systems of social relationship, Wardaman people recognize several
(equatable) sets of subsection (or ""eight-class"") terms, but identify only one of these as
""proper"" Wardaman. That set is given in 5.13. They also recognize matrifiliatively
transmitted recruitment to groupings commonly called ngurlu across the Victoria RiverIntroduction 7region. These groupings are not localized. Among my Wardaman informants, most
belonged to one or other of the ngurlu: goyin 'sugarbag', ganben 'flying fox', warrag
'catfish', yiburu 'black rain', and yiwaganga 'rain'. While some of these are specifically
Wardaman words (e.g., goyin), certain of the names (e.g., yiburu) have wider currency
across the region, and cannot be considered only Wardaman.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"103. Noun phrase constituency and ordering
Lexemes in noun phrases are normally from nominal, pronominal and demonstrative
word classes. Perhaps the most common type of noun phrase in the textual corpus
consists of a single word, normally a lexical noun. Number words (such as lege One',
ngawumen 'many'), indefinite words (such asyijarlu 'some', and yiwama-mulu 'some228 Chapter 10others'), interrogative words (such as ngamanda 'what' or 'which'), and semantically
adjectival nominals such as \vudu 'little', may all occur as the sole word-level constituent
of a noun phrase, with no internal syntax.
As has been described elsewhere in this grammar, certain dependent elements may be
postposed to the main classes of nominal word—mainly to the lexical noun, semantically
adjectival noun, pronominal and in some instances also to demonstratives — which
qualify or delimit the meaning of the noun phrase so constructed. Such postposed
elements include those of ""having"" and ""lacking"" (5.3.1., 5.3.2.), the adverbial element
-barra - warra (5.4.); that which means ""and all"" or ""end of list"" (5.5.), the article suffix
-bi ~ wi (5.7.), -gari Other, another, different' (5.9.), -biji which means Only' (5.12.),
and the ""focal member of pair"" element -garrma ~ -warrma (5.6.1.). Such postposed
elements may occur in noun phrases of a single word, or of more than one word. In the
latter case certain of them may occur between the words of the larger phrase:
(529) lege-biji
one-onlymulurru
old woman-ABS0-dagbarla-rri
3SG-have-PST'He only had one old woman/wife'.
Despite the fact that the ""focal member of pair"" element is inherently dual, it frequently
occurs with dual-marked demonstrative determiner, in which case dual number is
pleonastically marked. The nominal so marked is also frequently followed in the same
tone unit (hence, I will assume, within the same noun phrase in a way that could be
considered semantically conjunctive) by lexical specification of the second member of
the pair:
(530)du it
wurr-yana-rri
yinggi

""They did it [poisoned] you

"254 Chapter 10This example might be seen to illustrate both types of particle cooccurrence
characterized above. First, in the second line there is the combination girdibun-ma which
means 'finish, end' (and as a nominal modifier may mean ""all, the whole lot"") together
with the particle plus verb combination yarr-ma ya- 'to diminish, tail off, end', often used
of seasonal rains. The former particle is more general than the first in that it expresses
completion more broadly, and restricts the following lexical combination, producing a
meaning something like ""when it ended completely, altogether"". In the last line is the
combination bogogo ngurlmud, of the second sort, where one particle cannot be seen as
restricting or modifying the other, because they are of approximately equal lexical
specificity, semantically compatible in that each designates activities defined in
opposition to staying put, being in camp and the like. The result is a more conjunctive
kind of expression: ""foraging and camping out"".

(615) may be considered an instance of the second kind, where there is a relation of
semantic compatibility and partial synonymy between the two particles, lurle used in the
meaning 'cry, weep' and mulerr-ma with connotations of public, loud, grieving and
mourning, particularly for a death. Together the particles encode and reinforce a single
predicate meaning (as opposed to a more clearly conjunctive one of the bogogo ngurlmud
type).

In (616), moyin-ma (which, like some other constructions of sentiment and affect,
occurs with the Absolutive nominal mejern 'stomach', see 10.4.), apparently conveys a
sense of worry or concern, while luyurr-ma designates longing, pining, or sometimes
compassion for. The combination seems to be conjunctive, rather than one particle
restricting the other.
(617)warlarrgu
outsidewud-janga-ndi
3NSG-come-PSTwerrwerr
outwards rdp'They came outside'.
As first briefly mentioned in 7.6.3., in Wardaman as in Wakiman (see Cook 1987:253),
there is a common use of two orientational particles which locate action or state as
""outwards"", ""outside"" and ""inwards, inside"" (but the relational sense, or the relation to
something else, of both terms may sometimes not be very precisely defined or explicitly
indicated). In Wardaman, the most common term that designates 'inside, inwards' isIssues in constituency and word order 255warljub(-a), and this is more adverbial than specifically particle-like, in that it readily
occurs with any number of finite verbs, and is not particularly strongly associated with
any, in anything approximating a regular particle plus finite verb combination. There is,
however, a second particle wululu 'inwards, inside', which while it may combine with
any verb of motion (""come"", ""go"" etc.), tends to occur with special frequency with we-,
which by itself means 'fall'. The combination wululu we-, however, does not mean to
""fall in(side)"", but rather simply 'go inside, motion inwards' wululu ngerr-we-n 'let us
go inside'.
The particle werr-ma Outwards, outside' is often used to describe the situation of
people emerging from the countryside into a camp or habited place, approximately 'they
came out'; it is used to describe where rivers and creeks come ""out"" or debouche; and to
describe the emergence of dreaming figures from the landscape or from a position covert
within landforms into the visible world, or into a particular place. As in (610), this particle
may occur with other forms such as warlarrgu, generally used (now, at least) to talk about
Outside' a house or other structure as opposed to inside, and of such generality that it
might be designated an adverb as easily as a particle. Although werr is also of
considerable generality (i.e., it is used to describe the ""outward"" motion or position of a
large range of arguments), it is more particle- than adverb-like in that it is regularly found
in lexical-syntactic combination with the finite verb bu- to express action or motion
outwards (although it MAY also occur with other verbs). Thus, the coocurrence of
warlarrgu and werr would seemingly be best described semantically as one of a more
general item modifying a more specific one, and together expressing not just emergence
Outwards' (i.e., the inward to outward trajectory of werr), but to the outside (the general
location designated by warlarrgu).
The examples presented so far have been of particles cooccurring within a single clause
on a tone unit, where each particle (or adverb) is associated with the finite verb of the
clause, each in the same way, or one apparently modifying or restricting the other. It
often happens in connected narrative that particles are used without a finite verb but
simply with a major argument of a (partly realized) clause, often the object, as in the
following:
(618)wurr-bel-wu-rri-ya

grass-ABSgunga
3SG-DATbarlbarlb
spread rdp'They sliced it, that's all (finished)
the two of them spread the grass out for it
heap up stones, spread out grass'.
Especially given the preceding context, the last tone unit can be easily understood
despite the absence of any finite verb. There are many textual examples elsewhere of a256 Chapter 10tone group consisting of one or two grammatically complete clauses, and then an
""appended"" particle without finite verb, final or near-final within the tone group. The
effect of this kind of ""incomplete"" structure is to indicate that the action, condition etc.
designated by the particle should be interpreted in relation to the rest of the tone group,
and in direct relation to major arguments within it. Insofar as ""ellipsis"" is used to mean
that some constituent formerly present has been zeroed, the term does not seem
appropriate. We seem to be dealing with instances in which the particle SUGGESTS the
fuller verbal expression. The following set of examples should illustrate this common
textual effect:

to be the immediately preceding magulu, and the subject, the 3NSG pronominal on the verb.

and then repeated in the third line, which ends with particle ngay 'mix, stir', and no finite
verb. The following line begins with the finite verb (me- is the usual finite verb with
ngay, while jubung commonly occurs with both bu- and me-), a repetition of ""with

predicate, however, but returns to the theme of shooting and the fact that even little
children were killed.

3SG-AUXPST river-ABSjudjud
descend'He got up quickly with a start
ran and descended to the river'.
The first line might be interpreted as a combination of particles of compatible
semantics, gud more general in that it designates arising, getting up, and wardabarrb
more specific in that while it implies arising, it also specifies the manner in which it is
done as sudden, or unexpected. Both gud and wardabarrb normally occur (in
intransitive clauses) with finite verb gaju-. That is, it is probably not appropriate to see
wardabarrb as the particle of a truncated or ellipsed clause, but as the second member
of a particle combination with gud. In the second line, however, we may posit that
yirrgulun judjud are members of an incompletely specified predication ""and descended
to the river"". Indications that this string never achieves clausal status are: first, that
yirrgulun is Absolutive, instead of Allative as one might expect in a fully developed
clause; and secondly, \hatjudjud normally occurs with we- in the meaning 'descend',
and therefore may be interpreted as occurring here without finite verb. The latter point
is somewhat equivocal, for judjud also regularly occurs with the verbs of motion 'go'
and 'come'; however, given the lack of case-marking on 'river', we may interpret this as
a textually-cohesive fragment, rather than as a particle-combination with finite verb να-.
A passage similar in context occurs further on in the same text from which (622) was
drawn:

Here the particlejudjud is once again apparently not directly paired with a finite verb
(though the ""river"", the place to which the subject descended, is regularly case-marked).
The meaning is perfectly clear because of the surrounding specification of the nature and
direction of action.

The particle duba is here without finite verb, normally.//«!»/-, but again its absence does
not impair intelligibility.
Although such unpaired particles commonly occur tone-group finally, as so far
illustrated, they may also occur in other positions, especially group-initially:

3SG-AUX-PST
wardang
belly-upngawun
nothing0-wudba-rri
3SG-AUX-PST'She struggled, nothing [to no avail]
he grabbed and threw her belly-up'.
The particle new 'grab' is unpaired; it usually occurs with me-, and does not occur by
itself in combination with \vudba- (which as independent verb means 'throw', and
obviously retains some ofthat semantic content in its combination with wardang). 'Grab'
in such a construction as this obviously has the same nominal arguments as wardang.
While further above were illustrated kinds of particle combinations which may be seen
as members of a single finite clause, in the immediate preceding examples we have what
should be regarded as particle adjuncts of less than full clausal status to a single clause.
These adjuncts add to the development of text, and are related to the fully specified clause
in a way that presupposes the sharing of major arguments and argument functions by the
particles, and the applicability of other verbal categories (tense-aspect) to the additional
particle as well as to the clause as a whole. These constructions cannot, however, taken
to be serialized ones insofar as ""serialization"" is understood to mean the regular
combination of predicates in determinate lexical meanings. The constructions illustrated
here are textual ones, i.e. not essentially analyzable at the clause level, though they
certainly interact with and are constrained by clause-level structure. The particle
adjunction effects a close textual linkage between the major clausal predicate(s) and the
adjoined one. This packaging of narrative material is most closely comparable to the
inclusion, within a single tone-group, of more than one finite clause. While comparable,
these processes must be distinguished.","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

"Categories of the finite verb 203However, a bipartite transitive-intransitive division of both clauses and verbs is
unsatisfactory. Let us consider clause types first, and here it becomes apparent that it is
useful to recognize at least three major ones, and at least one minor one.
An intransitive clause may be defined as one with one pronominal verb prefix (Table
16, Type 1). Various kinds of complements may occur in the intransitive clause, none of
which is marked in the verb, e.g., a clause with predicate of motion may have a
Dissociative nominal complement, 0-yanggi gunya ' he went away from him', a location
complement of some kind, and so on.
The canonical transitive clause is one in which there are two pronominal adjuncts, one
of which may be linked to an independent Ergative-marked nominal (that is, if this is
present), while the other represents the direct object category (Type 3). There is a
ditransitive clause type, which only a few predicates may realize, in which the two
pronominal adjuncts represent the semantic agent and the semantic indirect object (Type
4).

Type 2 in Wardaman, i.e., that in which there is one pronominal adjunct to the verb, a
semantic agent, and a Dative (often, semantically benefactive) clausal argument function
which cannot be encoded on the verb, but may be expressed by independent nominal
phrase, commonly a pronominal. If one takes the presence of verbal pronominal prefixes
as definitional, this clause type is to be regarded as intransitive. But if one defines the
clause type in terms of predicate semantics and argument roles, such a clause-type would
better be regarded as two-place, rather than one-place (intransitive) with possible
additional complements. The agent nominal, if present in such clauses, is overwhelmingly Absolutive, although it may occasionally be Ergative-marked
One might also recognize as a distinct sub-type the clause with one pronominal adjunct
which is a semantic agent or experiencer, in which there may be an Instrumental phrase
expressing the semantic cause or source. The archetypal predicate which occurs in this
clause type in Wardaman is ba- 'bum, perish', often with Instrumental niarninggam-yi
'sun'. As with other intransitives, there is an optional purposive (formally Dative)
argument position ""for which"" that may occur with this predicate, e.g., nga-ba-n wiya-wu
'I'm thirsty for water'. But the really distinctive things about this clause type are, first,
the presence of the semantically agentive nominal phrase which cannot be marked on
the verb, but instead is realized as Instrument; and the encoding of the sole semantically
patientive nominal by subject form-class in the verb.
It seems out of keeping with the structural diversity of clause types, then, to simply
recognize a distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses. We may more204 Chapter 8usefully recognize (at least) the types shown in Table 16. Some further minor types may
also be identified on both semantic and formal grounds; e.g., that described in the
preceding paragraph; the mediopassive construction; and as will be seen below, a
construction type might be recognized for which a label ""medioactive"" might be coined,
to handle the case of a some predicate (particle plus verb) phrases which mainly designate
weather conditions.
If it is not useful to recognize a simple bipartite division of clauses, it is also not
completely satisfactory to recognize a bipartite division of verbs, for at least two reasons.
The first is that the transitivity value of finite verbs as sole predicate constituent, and as
member of a particle plus verb construction, may be and often is different. There is a
large number of particle plus verb combinations, in which the finite verbs are the same
ones that generally occur elsewhere as predicates of transitive clauses. With some
particles, however, they do not determine transitive clause structure. For example, the
finite verb gi-, by itself, is transitive, or the predicate basis of transitive clauses. With
the particle mllid 'show', however, it takes only one pronominal adjunct, and any indirect
object, ""person shown to"", is a Dative-marked nominal which cannot be encoded in the
verb; thus its argument structure is of the Absolutive-Dative kind. In combination with
other particles, such as denberr 'hang up, suspend', gi- is the basis of transitive clause
structure.
In the same way the verb root bu- may occur in transitive and other clause types
depending upon its occurrence as sole predicate, versus its particular lexical combination
with given particles. Although bu- as sole verbal constituent is transitive, in the particle
plus verb combinationyMrd^a) bu- 'to show to' it occurs in the Absolutive-Dative clause
type, and any ""person shown to"" must be Dative-marked outside the verb.
The root bu- is particularly common in particle plus verb combinations which designate
weather conditions, and clauses of this kind show no evidence of being structurally
transitive. For example, in clauses with the particle plus verb combinations jurrg(ba)
bu- 'sprinkle, rain lightly', and larrawardba bu- 'to break' (of day), there is no syntactic
indication of transitivity:
(482)galulul ya-0-wudba
toprdp 3-3SG-throwmarlnga
cloud-ABSjurrg-ba
sprinkleya-0-bu-n-ga
3-3SG-AUX-PRES-SUB'Way high up clouds form when it sprinkles'.
There has never been found to be an explicitly agentive nominal which may occur with
this combination, although the ""cognate"" nominal wiyan 'rain', in Absolutive form, may
co-occur.
(483)larraward-ba
break-PSya-0-bu-n
3-3SG-AUX-PRESmaminggani
sun-ABS'The day is breaking'.
The Absolutive form of ""sun"" in propositions with this combination may be taken as
an indication that it is formally intransitive (i.e., one-place). It might, as suggested above,
be useful to recognize this as a distinct predicate class, for bu- otherwise typically occursCategories of the finite verb 205in transitive or Absolutive-Dative clause types. Combinations of bu- with other particles,
such as bag 'break', yield transitive clause structures.
Likewise, the verb na- 'see' is ordinarily transitive (ngawun-da-n Ί see them'), but
occurs in a formally intransitive clause structure with the particle lag(ba), meaning as a
whole 'to dry up, become dessicated'; in this combination, it is partly synonymous with
the combination lag(ba) ngegba- 'to die and dry up', where ngegba- normally, as sole
predicative constituent, occurs in intransitive clause structure.
The second kind of evidence that militates against a strict transitive-intransitive
distinction at the level of the predicate is the fact that one important predicate, yana- 'say,
do' is found used both transitively and intransitively. Clauses with this predicate tend to
be structured transitively first, where there is a jussive complement of ""commanding
that"" (see 477 above), or second, of ""saying to that"" with complement clause not one of
directly reported speech, in which case the person told may be treated as direct object:
(484)ngan-yana-rri
3SG/lSG-say-PSTya-0-nyangi-we
3-3SG-come-FUTyiwarna
nextwiyan
rain'She told me she will come next year'.
Note that this amounts to the possibility of ""indirect"" report, i.e., the report is not framed
as direct speech, but rather as a summary of what was said, or as indirect speech.
Transitive usage of the verb also is common where what is said is a nominal ""cognate
object"" of speech of some kind, and not necessarily a complement clause:
(485) nganburr-yana-rri-ya
3NSG/lSG-say-PST-NARmadin
word-ABS'They gave me knowledge', in the sense 'they imparted information'.
Intransitive usage tends to correspond to the function ""tell to"", ""say to"" or ""relate to"",
where the complement is a clause of reported (direct) speech:
(486) dana-ni-wan
this-ART-DF0-yana-rri
3SG-say-PSTnganu
1SG-DAT""This is the one"", she said to me'.
The same possibility of variable transitivity exists with the particle plus verb
combination yang(ma) bu- 'tell, inform'. Ί informed them' may be either yang
nga-bu-ndi wurrugu or yang ngawun-bu-ndi, and either may have a full linked clause
(either independent or subordinate in form) specifying the content of the report. Textual
examples were recorded in which the particle jurd-(ba) 'show, indicate', which normally
occurs with finite verb bu- in Absolutive-Dative clause-type such that any ""person shown
to"" must be put into Dative case, alternatively occurs with constructionally transitive
yana-, as indicated by the fact that the one to whom something is shown is marked by
object pronominal form in the verb. (For a parallel difference in transitivity of the ""say""
verb in Wakiman, see Cook 1987: 221.)206 Chapter 8Given the evidence presented here of the inadequacy of a bipartite transitiveintransitive distinction at either clause- or predicate-level, we nevertheless capture
something significant about the language by noting that there tends to be congruence
between particular verbs as sole predicative constituent and particular clause types, i.e.,
bu- as sole predicate normally occurs in transitive clauses. Further, predicates which as
sole constituent function transitively also, in combination with particles, commonly
occur in Absolutive-Dative clause structures; but predicates which function intransitively
as sole verbal constituent also tend to function intransitively in combination with
particles.
There is no single process of transitive-intransitive derivation (but see 8.19. on
causatives). Rather the difference between transitive and intransitive predicate meanings
and associated clause structures is generally managed ""lexico-syntactically"", by the
alternation of different finite (auxiliary) verbs with the same particle. Hence, the
difference implemented by such alternation is often not simply a grammatical one relating
to transitivity, but may also involve additional elements of lexical semantics. Below are
listed a number of common alternations of the same particle with different finite verbs,
the difference instantiating the difference between transitive and intransitive clause
structures:

pairings are found As independent predicate gi- means 'put', and jingi- 'sit', but the
latter also has an important copula function (""be, be in a place""), as well as auxiliary
function with particles.
The sense of some of the pairs listed may be more or less transparent. In some cases
the pair corresponds to a difference in transitivity in clause type, but seemingly without
great semantic difference, e.g., mamaj ngen-me-n 'he beckons me', versus mamaj
ya-0-yana nganu 'he beckons to me', or the like.
The difference in pairings with wabirl is that between ""peel"" or ""take the skin off,
versus ""come, peel off, fade, fall off, as one might say of paint on the wall or colour in
clothing.
There are many alternative possible pairings where there is no change in transitivity of
the clause, but rather a semantic difference in the nature of the action predicated. In
Wardaman, this kind of alternation cannot be seen as of formally different kind to the
transitive-intransitive pairings shown above. Some of these alternative pairings give
some insight into verbal lexical semantics. Examples are:

"6.5. Genitive independent pronouns
In addition to ""base"" and Dative series pronominal forms, there is a distinct Genitive
series, with the following forms:
1SG
nganinggin2
3yinggawun
gungan.ginDUAL
yawungginNSG
ngarmgun.gin
yirrugun.gin
nurrugun.gin
wurrugun.ginThe genitive element in this series (except for 2SG) is evidently -gin (see 11.4.), and it
would appear that, historically, this series was built on the Dative, but has subsequently
become formally independent of the latter.
The genitive series serves: adnominally, to mark the pronominal possessor, sometimes
in conjunction with a free Dative form of the same propositus person; to mark that aIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 119contextually understood or specifiable, but lexically unspecified, nominal is possessed.
Such a ""headless"" Genitive phrase functions itself as predicate argument. The Genitive
pronouns, as attributives and as arguments in their own right, may be inflected for the
full range of nominal case endings, as exemplified with 1SG:
Absolutive

arguments, they may be appropriately translated in some contexts as ""on me"", ""from me"",
and the like; that is, express personal reference, rather than being modifiers. The
following exemplify the different uses of the Genitive forms:

'Let the grog be, leave it, get meat and food, tobacco and matches as we always

In (223) the Genitive pronoun yirrugun.gin serves as attributive of a nominal phrase
(presumably ""meat, food"" etc. actually ellipsed within the prosodic line, which ended
with the possessive pronoun in the original utterance). The speaker resumes with the120 Chapter 6phrase ""food for the children"". Further examples illustrating a variety of points are all
drawn from a single text:

""cry (for)"", as is characteristic for both.

The modifying phrase which specifies the identity of the old woman (""my father's

clause, but rather is an Absolutive identifying phrase with Dative possessor phrase. TheIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 121ordering in that phrase is modified-Genitive modifier, which as can be seen from the
other examples given above, alternates rather freely with the reverse order.

'They beat him severely and he left he died on my account, only his children
called me a sorcerer'.
This example shows a Dissociative-marked Genitive pronoun meaning ""on account of
me, on my account"". In the context, the speaker's meaning was not literally that the man
referred to had died on her account, but there is here rather more complex attribution of
""authorship"". The speaker's meaning was that the man's children said that he had died
on account of her — they alleged she had poisoned him; thus the ""voice"" of the clause
""he died on my account"" is that of the man's accusing relatives, yi-geye-mulu, somewhat
unsually in this syntactic context, occurs in Absolutive (rather than Ergative) form.
However, that may be linked to the fact that the speaker paused briefly following the
phrase ""his children"", perhaps considering how to put the unpleasant accusation. (In the
first line, digirrij may mean either (completely) dead, or as we say, ""near-dead"",
""half-dead"", or the like. Here, the meaning is that the beating was severe, but that the
man was able to carry himself off).
Finally, when Genitive pronouns are used in headless phrases, it is rather common that
the possessive phrase be expanded by use of a complementary free Dative pronoun of
the same person and number (see also 10.4.). For example, a typical verbless predication
of possession is of the following sort:
(231) nana
that-ABSnganinggin
nganu
/
1SGGEN-ABS 1SGDATgungan.gin
gunga
3SGGEN-ABS 3SG DAT'That is mine'/'That is his, hers'.
An example of this kind of Absolutive Genitive, which in context occurred as object
of the verb ""put"", is:

free forms
The base pronominal forms, Absolutive and Ergative, in their functions as explained in
6.1. above, commonly occur suffixed with the article -hi ~ -wi. The article suffix (as
described in 5.7.), when added to a non-nominal part of speech, serves to nominalize or
make more concrete its reference; and when added to a nominal form, does something
like make its reference more definite, in a way that is often best translatable by English
substitutive ""one"" (""big one"", etc.). Yet the article cannot be regarded as a form that
stands in place of an ellipsed lexical expression (as English substitutive ""one"" does).
Rather, in keeping with the fact that Wardaman nominals of adjectival kind very
commonly constitute a nominal phrase by themselves (see Chapter 4), what the article
does is to suggest more concretely a domain of reference of which the current nominal
token is ""one"". The article suffix thus performatively marks, not ellipsis, but
definitivization.
The article suffix is commonly added to free pronouns, both Absolutive and Ergative
(see an example of the latter in (199)). Following the Ergative suffix, the article
invariably has the shape -wi; thus the Ergative-article sequence is yi-wi, as in 1SG
ERG-ART ngayug-ji-wi, etc. However, in the Absolutive series we find apocope of the
final vowel of the 1SG form before the article suffix, the occurring form being not
ngayugu-wi but ngayug-bi. For the sake of clarity the article-suffixed Absolutive forms
are listed:

3PLnarnaj-guya-wi
narnaj-bulu-wi, narnaj-ganung-biWith the free pronouns, the article suffix usually contributes an emphatic element of
meaning reinforcing the pronoun's reference, something like ""I myself, as in:
(233) nga-gaju-wa
ngayug-bi
ISG-arise-FUT
1SG-ABS-ART
Ί for one will get up', Ί myself will get up'.
In comparison with this, as observed in 6.1., the essentially third person form ngajbang
which may occur with any person/number form, is often understood to express a different
nuance, ""I alone"", or ""I by myself.
Built on the base stems, and showing the same slight differences from the latter as the
article-suffixed forms, is a series which expresses that the referent of the pronoun isIndependent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 123""first"". This series is formed with the suffix -baywa ~ -waywa. It is syntactically
anomalous in that it often is understood as in construction with a transitive subject
pronominal form in the verb, in which instance one normally expects any external
pronoun to be Ergative-marked. The ordinary interpretation of these forms, however,
appears to be as in construction with the agent pronominal in transitive clauses, despite
the absence of Ergative marking, as in:
(234)ngayug-baywa
1SG ABS-firstngawun-da-rri

(235)namaj-baywa
3SG ABS-firstngan-da-rri
3SG/lSG-see-PST'He saw me first' [he before others].
Like the article suffix, this suffix is final, and follows any overtly-marked dual number:
e.g., nurrug-(g)uya-waywa 'you two first'.
This suffix has also been found with certain primary adverbs to create secondary ones
which seem to have a somewhat more explicit relational sense, e.g., fromjaburru 'ahead,
in front', jaburrung-baywa 'first, ahead of anyone'. It is also suffixed to nominal stems
to create more adverbial forms of manner: yi-bam-baywa 'head-first', banggin-baywa
'back-first'.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"

Ergative typically marks the nominal transitive subject even where there may be no
expressed nominal object, but only object marking on the verb (zero for third person
singular. See 10.10. for discussion of the ordering of lexically realized nominal
functions).
There are a number of verbal meanings for which pairs of verbs are found, one member
of the pair transitively used, the other intransitively. Examples are the pairs burla-ma'deceive, lie to' and burla-yi- 'tell lies'; geng-ma- 'to fear' and gengmi-yi- 'be afraid of
(with Dative object). The ""mediopassive"" forms appear to be used more frequently to
designate typical disposition, the others to designate particular events; thus,
ya-wurr-burla-yi-n is often used to mean 'they tell lies' (typically). (See 8.12. for the
'mediopassive' category.)
By ""ditransitive"" constructions are meant those in which there are two notional (and
sometimes, overtly expressed or non-zero) objects. One of these is typically animate,
and generally, but not always, also human, the notional ""indirect object""; the other is
usually inanimate, the notional ""direct object"" of the action. Verbs or verb plus particle
constructions which are typical predicates of such clauses, include: wo- 'give to';jewu'show to, teach'; also birrg gerne- 'to take from', mowo- 'to steal from\jomarna~ 'finish'
(e.g., food). Examples with such predicates illustrate the case-marking of associated
nominals:66 Chapters(8)yarrimanbu-yi

Here, the first prosodic line is equivalent to a clause, with Ergative-marked nominal

Here again, notional indirect object is expressed only on the verb, as is typical (although

could be Ergative-marked nominal transitive subject. A ditransitive construction of this
kind contrasts syntactically with one involving verb particle plus auxiliary of similar
meaning, but in which the indirect object is expressed with the Dative (see 5.2.3.), and
the notional direct object, once again with Absolutive-marked nominal:

is said. However, it has alternatively been found to occur with ""person to whom"" treated
as direct object, as in the following example where it occurs with particle jarnbab 'tryNominal classes, inflection and derivation 67to, persist in (unsuccessfully)' (Kriol 'hard work (la)'). Compare the alternative case

As already noted, nominals functioning instrumentally can be distinguished from
transitive subject nominals in that they are not in agreement with pronominal marker on
the verb. For example, the verb ba- 'burn, thirst, perish' most typically enters into two
kinds of constructions: one, with intransitive subject (usually marked only on the verb
by prefix) and dative complement expressing that for which one is burning (wiya-wu 'for
water'); and one with intransitive subject, the experiencer, and instrumental complement
expressing that which is causing one to thirst or burn:
(16)nga-ba-n
ISG-burn-PRESmarninggani-yi
sun-INST'I'm burning in the sun'.
Since ""sun"" can never show verbal agreement, it is regarded as Instrument rather than
transitive subject. Instrument thus marks the nominal that expresses the means by which
an action is accomplished, as distinct from the agent of the action, the transitive subject.
Other examples of Instrumental nominals are:

One of the ways of saying ""to forget"" is with verb we- (which otherwise means'to fall'),

with nominal complement mejern 'stomach', e.g., mejern lud-ba jingi- ('stomach',
particle lud-ba, and AUX jingi-) 'to be happy, glad' (with possible Dative complement
""concerning which"").

in predicative function.

"64 ChaptersBefore each case category is described and illustrated, the relation between nominal
cases and marking of case relations in the two prefixal slots on the verb can be briefly
summarized.
The Wardaman verb maximally bears two pronominal prefixes which relate to noun
phrases in the clause. In keeping with this, there are two distinguishable prefixal formorder classes (subject and object). Subject of the intransitive verb is coded by subject
pronominals in the verb and by Absolutive case in the noun; transitive subject by subject
pronominals in the verb and by Ergative case in the noun, and direct object of the
transitive verb by object pronominals in the verb and Absolutive case in the noun. In
ditransitive clauses (""my father gave me to them""), the nominal agent (""father"") is
Ergative-marked and coded by subject pronominal on the verb, while the semantic
indirect object (""them"") is coded by object pronominals in the verb, the semantic direct
object (""me"") cannot be coded on the verb, and both notional ""indirect"" and ""direct""
external (nominal or pronominal) objects are Absolutive case. (See further 8.17.)
The case system is the same for all types of nominal: pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogative pronouns, nouns and adjectival nouns.
5.2.1. Ergative and instrumental cases
Case-marking of the transitive subject nominal is formally identical to marking of the
instrumental one. However, the two case functions can be distinguished syntactically in
that the instrumental noun is not marked in the verb. The following exemplify Ergative
marking of the transitive subject:
(1)dang-nyi

(668) contains two purpose complements: the first, ngorlogbawu 'to talk'; the second,
a purposive nominalization of the finite verbjewu- 'show, teach' (a ditransitive clausal
predicate). Such a nominalized complementizer cannot, as already noted, be inflected
for person, and so there are two ways in which the (intended) subject-object relations of
the complement are understood: first, in relation to the sense conveyed by the
grammatical structure of the main clause; and second (optionally, and not realized here
in the complement) for the semantic object of the complement to be made explicit by a
Dative free pronoun. In this example, since ""I"" always come to ""you"" for talk, the
complement is understood to continue the same subject-object relations. The intended
object ""me"", however, could also be realized by 1SG DAT pronoun nganu.

In (669) the complement has nominalized form ofjejbarla- 'ask', and object of the
complement ""money"" in Dative case, as it would also normally be in a finite clause with
this predicate, the person asked for money the direct object. The person being asked is
not made explicit here, but could be a free Dative pronoun. Despite this possibility,
Purposive complements tend to be infrequent in the text material gathered, and the few
that occur are simple, usually having only one Dative-marked argument of the
complement clause. These Purpose complements are distinct from the Allative-marked
ones discussed in 12.4.3., however, in that the main clause predicate may be transitive.

Just as in (669) where the main clause predicate was intransitive, in (670) the argument
structure of the main clause ditransitive verb jewu- is understood to apply to the
complement.
The main clause may overtly consist of just a nominal argument with zero copula verb

Informants produced alternatives to (672) with Dative-marked predicate loyi-wu, and
such ""dativization"" of the bare stem of finite verbs is occasionally found.
Some elicited purpose complements of this kind seemed to be used in relation to a
general purpose, so that the construction could appear with no Dative-marked argument
in the complement clause.

Finally, mention needs to be made of a Purposive formation possible with finite verbs

they add the particle suffix form -ma, following a textually rare Purposive suffix of the

There is some functional overlap between Instrumental and Adverbial -barra (see

5.2.2. Absolutive case
Some functions of Absolutive case have already been summarized: it is the case of the
intransitive subject and the direct object, and of both notional ""indirect"" and ""direct""
object nominals in ditransitive clauses. It is also the usual case-form of the notional agent
in clauses without identifiable, grammatical direct object, that is, in which any second
participant is not marked in the verb, but is in Dative (or other, oblique) case-form.
Absolutive is the usual ""citation"" form which informants use to mention the word for
something.","[91, 92]"
"10.6. The negated noun phrase
One of the most commonly heard words in Wardaman is ngawun 'nothing, none'. One
man of my acquaintance was in fact called by the nickname ""Ngawun"", because
whenever anybody asked him for anything they could be sure of his answer. However,
ngawun is an interjection. The particle which most commonly negates the noun or noun
phrase is wonggo, or secondarily warna. These always precede that which they negate
(see 12.2.5.).

"4.2. Nominals: Pronouns, nouns, demonstratives, and
interrogatives
""Nominal"" is the cover term used for a broad class of lexical items which can inflect for
case and certain other categories. Within the class of nominals, several sub-classes will
be identified. The syntactic patterning of all sub-classes tends to be Ergative-Absolutive
where there is an object marked on the verb (even if 3SG zero), but occasional instances
are found in text in which transitive agent nominals are not Ergative-marked.
Pronouns are those nominals which refer to speech-situation participants, and some
which can index (emphatically, anaphorically) other nominals. There are many formal
similarities between the independent pronominal stems, and the affixal pronominal forms
obligatorily prefixed to the verb to indicate participant identities.
Demonstrative pronouns are a nominal sub-class which make reference in terms of
graded distance or location categories calibrated primarily in relation to the speech
situation (there are three such degrees marked by Wardaman demonstrative morphology,
and a whole host of formally related terms, ""this side"", ""that side"", etc.). One term in the
three-term spatial system, called Proximate, also serves to indicate textual recoverability.
Its forms are thus far more frequent than are those of the other two demonstrative
categories.
Interrogative pronouns are nominals with which different kinds of questions are
formed: ""what"", ""where"", ""who"". Secondarily, they function in the construction of
negative and indefinite arguments (""nobody"", ""somebody"").
Number words belong to the class of nominals. There are three numbers, lege One',
guyamin 'two', and murrgun 'three'. Beyond that ngawurnen indicates 'many, a large
number'. Number words may function as modifiers, or as noun phrase heads in their own
right.
Finally, there is a large class that will simply be called ""nominals"" in general, but which
comprehends what would be called ""nouns"" and ""adjectives"" in conventional part-of-58 Chapter 4speech terms. In dictionary entries and glosses, for the most part a distinction has been
made between the former (""N"") and the latter (""NADJ"")· This is not because the
distinction can be satisfactorily sustained for all purposes (see below), but because it
partly captures some distributional and functional differences within the class.
Some nominals, the notionally more adjectival ones like ""empty"", ""tough"", ""raw""
""crooked"", ""long"", ""good"" and so on, are more likely to function predicatively than are
what might be called argument nominals such as ""goanna"" (lizard),""woman"", and ""duly
bag"" (string bag). The more adjectival are regularly causativized and inchoativized,
while the argument nominals are not regularly so treated. Here, however, the distinction
is not absolute, for some of them which might be considered towards the attributive end
of a nominal-feature spectrum, and also some which designate persons in terms of agestatuses, for example, are found to be so treated. For example, a noun which typically
occurs as argument, meaning such things as ""plain, flat place"" (as opposed to ""flat"" in
general), may be causativized. A noun such as ""man"" may, also. Finally, the more
adjectival are commonly found in modifying function, while the others are not.
While a degree of distinctiveness thus can be identified between notionally adjectival
and other nominals, in Wardaman as in many other Australian languages (and regional
ones, including Wardaman's putative congeners, see Cook 1987: 88), the formerare not
limited to predicative and modifying functions, but also regularly function as arguments.
In Wardaman, their functioning as arguments is implemented with the help of the overt
nominal class markers which are prefixed to nominals of the adjectival sort, and create
forms the general kind of reference of which is indicated by the class marker, and the
more specific denotation of which is understood in terms of the ""property-like""
designation of the adjectival stem. Such forms may function syntactically as modifiers,
but equally, they may function as arguments in their own right. The difference between
the two different notional types is fluid enough so that stems of the more adjectival kind,
class-prefixed, may come to be regular designators of (kinds of) referents which have
the particular property. For example, the adjectival stem barnbamin means 'naked,
hairless'; with animate class prefix, the formyi-barnbarnin is used to mean 'buffalo'. To
give a second example, the adjectival stem langman means 'clear, cleared'; with class
prefix, the form wu-langman is taken to mean 'clear space, clear area', and case-inflected
forms of it are commonly used without any (other) argument noun, e.g., wu-langma-warr
'to a clearing, clear place' (allative-marked).
Another general difference between notionally ""argument"" and adjectival nominals is
that most of the former tend to regularly occur with only one class prefix (if any, for there
are argument nouns like bangbun 'woman' which never take overt class prefix). For
example, most body parts take the class prefix yi-, and tend to occur only with that prefix,
not with any other. On the other hand, most of the notionally adjectival nominals may
be freely prefixed with the range of class markers, something which changes their
understood designation. There are some indeterminacies here too, however (see 5.1. for
more detail), so relatively fixed versus variable class-marking of nominals can only be
taken as a general guide. The point in distinguishing between N and NADJ at all is not
to saddle the language with untenable distinctions, but rather to try to capture some of
the privilege-of-occurrence tendencies which are evident in Wardaman.","[81, 82]"
"AcknowledgementsMy thorough-going obligation to Wardaman people of Katherine, Northern Territory, as
well as my debt to some researchers who studied languages of this area before me, is
described in 1.5 of the following grammar. Here I would like to acknowledge support
for the funding of my research, and my gratitude to fellow researchers.
My first period of research in Katherine, from 1976 to 1979, during which I did
considerable work with Wardaman people, was funded by the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies, now the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Studies, Canberra. I am particularly grateful to Warwick Dix for having overseen many
aspects of field support.
In 1988 and 1989,1 was invited by Josephine Flood, then at the Australian Heritage
Commission, to take part in interdisciplinary research on Aboriginal sites of Willeroo,
Delamere and Innesvale Stations. Permission to visit those properties became easier to
obtain in the late 1980s than it had been before. As a result, I was able to expand my
familiarity with Wardaman country considerably. I was able to visit not only rock art
sites (the focus of research by archaeologists) but also many other Wardaman sites of
significance which I had been learning about for some years from Wardaman people.
For discussion of Australian languages and many other matters over the years, I would
like to especially acknowledge Paul Black, Jeffrey Heath, Pat McConvell, David Nash,
and Alan Rumsey. I am indebted to Georg Bossong for his useful editorial suggestions
on an earlier draft of this manuscript, especially for his comments on analysis of the
pronominal categories (Chaptero), and his encouragement to expand the analysis of word
order (Chapter 10). Lorraine Garland, Mark Harvey, Stephen Roberts, and Karen
Westmacott were invaluable assistants in the preparation of this manuscript. My thanks
also to the Cartography section of the Department of Geography at the University of
Sydney for preparation of maps.","[4, 5]"

Especially (667) shows the flexibility of this kind of complement, for ""Europeans"" are
clearly understood as subject in relation to the particle ""bathe"". It is probable that
wurnigu mernde-wu should be understood as a Dative-benefactive argument of the main
clause predicate ""fill"", and ""bathe"" as a minimal Purposive complement. Yet the example
shows how a grammatical subject can be clearly specified in relation to a purposive
particle complement, by use of Dative argument in the main clause.
11.4.2. Nominalized purpose complements (of finite verbs)
The purposive complement derived from a finite verb is built on the nominalized form
of the stem with the suffix -yin (H.3.), and any major objective argument of the
complement in Dative case. Nominalized forms of finite verbs, like particles, cannot
inflect for person; and so here, as in particle purposive complements, subject-object
relations of the complement are understood in terms of the relations in the main clause.
The system of ""control"" from the main clause cannot, then, be viewed as a grammatically
highly explicit one, for interpretation of the same complement clause could vary with the
sense established in the main clause.",[301]
"46 Chapters3.8. Reduplication
There is a considerable amount of non-productive or frozen lexical reduplication in
Wardaman, i.e., there are many words the basic form of which is reduplicative. These
include, for example, such particles as gijigijig 'tickle', mamajmamaj 'wave (to)',
dangdangma 'click', wujugwujug 'shake' (as tree, to dislodge animal or fruit), jibjib(a)
'itch', bornborn 'bathe', gajigaji 'walk, travel on foot', burrngburrng-ma 'boil', and so
on. Numerous examples could be cited among nouns. We will not consider such forms
here, but turn to productive processes of reduplication.
First, however, it may be mentioned here that word- and even phrase-level repetition
is a common means for indicating repetitive, intensive, or distributive activity. Consider
the following examples:
jarrug yirr-me-ndi
egg
lEXNSG-get-PST
yi-bumbu-gari
YI-bill-other-ABSjamam jamam
full
fullyi-bumbu-gari
YI-billy-other-ABS'We gathered eggs, full, full, another billycan, another billycan ...'.
Here, in order to convey the impression of durative and repetitive activity and outcome,
the speaker repeats both ""full"" and the phrase ""another billy"".
Other examples of word-level repetition are:
wurren
child-ABSyi-jad
YI-bigyi-jad,
YI-big-ABSyi-jarlu
YI-some-ABSwudu
smallwudu
small-ABS'some big big children, some little little ones ...'.
lege-ya
one-LOCyum-nya
tree-LOC0-jingi-ndi
3SG-sit-PSTwalig
aroundwalig
around'It was (there) all around a single tree ...'.
Here to give the impression of multiplicity, the speaker repeats the locational 'around'.
Another common way of indicating iteration, duration, repetition as a feature of text is
by over-long articulation of the final vowel of a verb form on a single pitch level:
wurr-wemiyi-rri::: yilgbayi 'they kept on vomiting, (then they were) OK'. There also
exists an iterative suffix (see 8.13.).
Here, we will not further consider word-level repetition or higher text-level
construction of iteration and related meanings, except to note that it is not possible to
make an entirely clear-cut distinction between word-level repetition, and what might
otherwise be seen as complete reduplication within the word. The difficulty of
distinguishing these two applies particularly to verb particles.
Several kinds of reduplication are found with verb particles. There are many particles
for which complete reduplication is common, warlbag 'to remove, take off, unsaddle'
etc. is commonly reduplicated as warlbagwarlbag; dijong-ma 'play the didgeridoo' as
dijongdijong-ma (but also dijorrong-ma), ngurluguy(-ma) 'mumble' as ngurluguy
ngurluguy(-ma), mambang 'chase' as mambangmambang, barlb 'put down, in' asProcess phonology 47barlbarlb (with degemination), duwu 'swell, grow' as duwuduwu, and so on. It is
possible to identify a complete reduplicative form as within the word, rather than word
repetition, where the particle-final suffix is commonly used with the particle, and also
appears in its reduplicative form (as with dijongdijong-ma, or barlbarlb-a 'put down,
in'). However, certain particles (like mambang) tend not to occur with particle-final
suffix, and their usual reduplicative forms do not either.
Partial reduplications are also common in verb particles as well as other parts of speech.
There appears to be no canon of phonological shape on the basis of which one may strictly
predict which words will reduplicate fully, and which partially, but there are indications
of some possible conditioning factors.
Certain words reduplicate partially, i.e., the first two syllables or CVC(C)V-, where
complete reduplication would result in otherwise rare consonant clusters (see 2.4.). Thus
the reduplicative form oflabang 'put on one's shoulders' is laba-rlabang, never complete
*labang-labang. (Note the cluster ng-l occurs rarely, and only across morpheme
boundary). And although reduplication of any type operates only upon words of two or
more syllables, those of more than two syllables tend to exhibit partial rather than
complete reduplication. Thus, the usual reduplication of the verb particle gayardung 'run'
is gaya-gayardung; that of adjectival nominal jaburrunggun 'antecedents,
predecessors', jajaburrunggun; that of yiguwarlangana 'single', yiguguwarlangana
(also yiguwarlangana-mulu).
Several important minor and major reduplicative patterns need to be mentioned. There
are two high-frequency noun stems which consist entirely of open syllables: marluga
Old man' and mulurru Old woman'. These have very high-frequency reduplicative
forms marlarluga and mululurru. Only the first stem, which contains vowels of different
quality, provides insight into the process:
In other words, the reduplicative segment is ma-RLA-rlu-ga, a combination of €2 and the
preceding V^ So common is this pattern that only two instances have been found in a
search of extensive text material of the alternatively possible marluga-mulu Old men'
with plural suffix: the reduplicated form is more common by far. And although a few
instances of mulurru-mulu have been found, this is by far less common than mululurru,
even when the noun is case-suffixed (as in mululurru-yi, ERG). Another example of this
pattern is the reduplicative form ofwardirrg 'young girl', wardardirrg 'young girls'.
That not all reduplications follow the above pattern (with reduplicative segment
composed of €2 and Vj) is shown by the common reduplicative form of jumba 'behind,
in back' : jumbamba. Here, the reduplicative segment is jum-iam-ba, or a combination
of CB and V2C2. This may be associated with words with first, closed syllable. Another
example of slightly variant kind is the reduplicative, functionally adverbial yondondorr
'along, on the road', derived from the noun yondorrin 'road'. Here, the reduplicative
segment is evidently d plus ViC 2 . Another form of this kind is walbalbamda On/along
a plain, flat place' from walbarndan 'plain'. Also from barrwa 'down', reduplicative
barrwarrwa should be considered of this kind.","[69, 70, 71]"
"11.7. Allative particle complements
In 11.4.3., the marking with Allative case of derived purpose, intention and goal
complements of motion verbs was discussed. As noted, particle complements of goal
are Allative-marked. There is, however, a syntactically distinct complement type with
Allative case-marked particle. This is one in which the particle is understood to
complement the object of a transitive clause. Such complements, like most other types,
tend to be rather limited, usually to just the Allative-marked particle itself. Examples of
this construction follow, with those drawn from texts so indicated, and with surrounding
context to clarify participant structure.

The protagonists in this portion of text are Aborigines, running from European fire; and
generalized European or Europeans. The Allative complement occurs in (e), do-marlawarr, and modifies nana mernden 'the white man', object of the verb ""see"": 'he saw the

subject: 'he, shooting, saw the whiteman'.

The protagonists here are an old man, who went to examine the site of a shooting at
night, after the Europeans had left; and a child, whom he finds amidst the bodies left
there. Ngenge-marla-warr must be interpreted as the complement of the (at first

The Allative complement is in (b)Juba-warr. The particle jub(a) may mean 'shut' or
'be blocked, deaf, depending on the finite verb. In the meaning ""shut in"", ""shut oneself
in"" (as a goanna may do), it usually occurs with finite verb bit-. Here it must be
understood to complement walanja 'goanna', the object of ""hit"" or ""kill"" in (a).
Commonly, in Wardaman, a transitive clause may occur without independent nominal
object: the object may be indicated only in the pronominal prefix (see 10.10. for
discussion of its relative lexical frequency of occurrence). As we have seen, in Wardaman
generally, case-marking of complement clauses should be regarded as applying to major
constituents of the entire clause; thus, e.g., predicate and major argument nominal phrases
are alike Source-marked (11.5.). A further indication of complement case-marking of
major constituents ""across the board"" is the following. Often though there is no objective
nominal argument of an Allative-marked, objective complement clause, there may
nevertheless be what might most appropriately be regarded as an 'adverb' modifying
(complementing) the main clause. Adverbs, as noted a number of different times (see
e.g., Chapter 4) cannot be sharply distinguished from particles in Wardaman. Such
adverbs by themselves may be Allative-marked, as if they were particles and/or occurred
in the complement clause with a particle. Two examples follow:

These examples show that within the transitive subject function, use of free Ergative
pronouns corresponding to subject pronominals in the verb emphasizes the salience of
the transitive subject category, whether in the context of a complete reversal of
participants with respect to subject and object roles in adjacent clauses (197), (199); the
contrast of two entities in different clauses with respect to something, where only one
may be cast grammatically as transitive subject (200); and also seemingly more subtle,
partly grammatical contrasts such as that in (198). In that complex example, in the first
clause 1SG acts on 2SG, ""I stopped you""; the second clause, complement to the first,
expresses what ""I"" stopped ""you"" from doing, i.e., from giving away ""our"" things freely;
the third clause, with 1SG ERG pronoun in first place, shows a return to 1SG as the agent
category, thus contrasting with 2SG of the previous clause. However, first person was
initially agent, in the first clause, and this seemingly accounts for the suffixation of 1SG
ERG pronoun with the ""defocusser"" -wan, which normally occurs on nominal topics (and
sometimes also on other topical constituent units, see 10.3.7. for details). That is,112 Chapter 6ERG-marking on 1SG free pronoun marks a change in agent from 2SG of the previous
clause, hence a contrast; but the resumed 1SG agent is topical, not new, hence
""defocussed"". See further 10.11. for comments on pronominal topics.
So far no third person ""base"" forms have been mentioned. The majority of third-person
referring forms are demonstrative pronouns, that is, they refer with locational contrast as
an inherent element of their meaning (primary spatial contrasts, designating in terms of
relative distance categories with reference to which the textual usage of some of these
forms must be understood). There is only one set of third person forms which is not
inherently demonstrative in this way, and this is a set with stem narnaj evident in all
forms. These are as follows:
3 SG
3DU
3PLAbsolutive
narnaj
narnaj-guya
narnaj-buluErgative
narnaj-(j)i
narnaj-guy a-yi
narnaj-bulu-yiThe forms are entirely regular. It is artificial to make a distinction between 3DU and
3PL here, in fact, on morphological grounds there is no distinction to be made even
between singular and nonsingular: the single stem narnaj is inflected with ordinary dual
and plural number forms. It is of interest, however, to note that an additional nonsingular
form with suffixal element -ganung, i.e., 3NSG namaj-ganung, has been recorded. This
suffix is also found with some of the demonstrative stems, see 7.2. All of these third
person forms are frequently found (in both Absolutive and Ergative case-functions) with
article-suffix (see 5.7.), e.g., narnaj-bi 3SG ABS; narnaj-guya-yi-wi 3DU ERG, etc. Use
of these forms is illustrated in the following examples:

(Note that 3NSG object ""children"" is marked in the verbal pronominal prefix, but that
the external nominal wurren is formally singular; it is not uncommon that PL not be
marked on the noun, though it is more usually marked on human as opposed to
non-human nouns.) Here the 3SG base form narnaj functions to make salient the
intransitive subject/reflexive object category by contrast with another object
(""children""), in the same way that has been illustrated for the free (first and second)
person forms.
A third person Ergative-marked form was illustrated in (199) above.

function of narnaj is associated with the switch of participants in relation to clause
function in adjacent clauses. A comparison is emphasized between the relation of
transitive subject ""I"" of the first clause to the ""him"" of that clause, with the ""he"" of the
second, by the use ofnamaj.
Finally concerning third person forms, it needs to be mentioned that there is a nondemonstrative, third person pronominal base ngajbang, which may usually be translated
""self or ""selves"", and which generally serves the emphatic function which that
translation suggests. In addition to being approximately equivalent to the ""myself of ""I
myself will do it"" (as contrasted with another's doing it), it very often has, like the English
emphatic form, the meaning ""by oneself, alone"". This form may be suffixed for dual or
plural number with the usual suffixes, but it may also function without such overt number
suffixation in apposition to nonsingular nominals, as in ngajbang-bi ngabobu-mulu
yinggi 'your father's mothers and mother's brothers themselves', ABS. And though
basically a third person category, it may function in apposition to any person category,
as the following examples illustrate:

It may be the case that qualifiers of two or three syllables (including noun class prefix),
no matter what their semantic type, have the greatest freedom of occurrence either before
or after the nominal. Certainly they seem to precede the nominal more often than do
longer modifiers. Other examples are:

(556)yl-birrba

"7.2. Demonstrative categories and some related forms
The demonstrative pronouns, may serve either as modifiers within a nominal phrase, or
like all sub-types of nominal in Wardaman, may by themselves constitute the sole,
reference-making member of a nominal phrase. As modifiers, they normally occur
within a phrase preceding the modified, but the reverse order may be found (10.3., 10.9.).
As modifiers and arguments, the demonstrative pronouns may be inflected for the range
of nominal case-suffixes.
The system of demonstratives shows a tripartite division in terms of spatial categories
which will be called ""Immediate"", ""Proximate"" and ""Remote"". These categories are
roughly translatable in English as ""this"", ""that"" and ""yonder"", and the spatial and textual
semantics of all of them will be illustrated below. In summary fashion, the spatial
reference of the Immediate category is in the vicinity of the speech situation, and may
designate within the vicinity of the speaker, hearer or both. Something that is designated
as ""that"" in the sense of distal from speaker but close to hearer is liable to be coded with
the Proximate category, but never with the remote category as it is still within range of
the location of the speech event. The Immediate and Remote categories are the most
closely linked in most of their uses to spatial semantics, although forms of the immediate
category may have textually immediate reference to that just said or about to be said.
The Remote category is most restricted to spatial reference in the extra-linguistic context138 Chapter?(as opposed to linguistic), and its use seems to be to refer to things, objects, locations etc.
which are generally visible from the location of the speech event, or portrayed as visible
from the perspective of a narrated or reported speech event, but in either case distal from
it.
This leaves relatively unspecified the proximate category, which is in fact widest of the
three in its range of uses, and the least restricted in its textual and other extended
distribution. As noted above, it may designate within the general vicinity of the speech
situation something that is distal from speaker and close to hearer, or something that is
distal from both but still relatively close. Further, it is the category generally used to
code the textual familiarity of some nominal, where its use often amounts to specification
of definiteness of the referent via its proximate text-spatial semantics. In this definitemarking usage it is often best translated by English definite article. It is also the category
most widely used to mark the relation of units of text to others, by means of inflected
forms which mean such things as ""and then, after that"", and so on.
Case forms in the three series are shown in Table 12. Stem morphology is not
complicated: each series has an Absolutive form, and a stem-form used with non-zero
suffixes. The two stems differ most unpredictably for the remote category.

aFor each stop, there is a corresponding nasal. There are five stop-nasal series (as in
neighbouring Mangarrayi, Merlan 1982; and Wardaman's congeners Yangman and
Dagoman, but unlike Wakiman to the north which, as noted in Chapter 1, has only four
points of articulation, and lacks the distinction between apico-alveolar and apico-domal
series, Cook 1987: 24).
The orthography is convenient in that it requires no special diacritics. However, the
digraph ng representing the velar nasal needs to be distinguished from the sequence
apical nasal plus velar stop , as in the word /dongo/ 'in a line'. In order to eliminate this
ambiguity, that combination is written with full stop separating the two segments: don.go.
This is not done at morpheme boundary, however, where the presence of hyphen is
sufficient to indicate that two distinct segments of different morphemes are involved,
e.g., yibiwan-gu 'man, person' (Dative).",[35]
"Introduction 3Yangman is no longer actively used. Yangman had been most widely spoken at Elsey
Station and the neighbouring town of Mataranka, but the numbers of active speakers
among these people and their descendants have dwindled. Among those with the best
knowledge of the language are now a number of Mangarrayi people at the excision
community, Jilkminggan [Jilgmirn.gan], on Elsey Station, and a small number of people
at Barunga, a settlement to the north of the Roper River. The Mangarrayi have lived and
intermarried with the Yangman at least since the building of Elsey Station on the Roper
River in the early years of this century (see Merlan 1978).
Though I have collected Yangman material from Mangarrayi people, I consider my
most significant data to have come from Mr. Jimmy Daniels, who was widely regarded
around Mataranka in the early 1980s as a (if not the) senior Yangman person, and the
only remaining person for whom Yangman was not only his ""own"" and ""proper""
language, but also his first language. He passed away in 1986 after prolonged and chronic
illness. Though Mr. Daniels consented to work with me on different occasions, his
personal preference was not to use or even think about Yangman much, as he told me.
Having spent quite a number of years as a highly regarded grounds worker on a station
in the region, he seemed to find the illness-ridden, less structured existence of his
""retirement"" years somewhat disspiriting and frustrating.
I am grateful for the information he provided, which includes about 500 lexical items,
fuller paradigmatic information than I could gather for Dagoman, and a couple of short
stories. From these data it is possible to be certain of the close genetic relation of
Yangman to Wardaman. Work with him also provided some measure of the extent to
which first-language Mangarrayi speakers with whom I did work on Yangman, were
interpolating Mangarrayi vocabulary. Most showed a tendency to use some words which
Mr Daniels rejected as not Yangman. I can only assume they are probably more prone
to do this now than the same people would have been twenty or thirty years ago, when
there were some Yangman people around who, because of their identity and use of the
language, kept it more current in the local communities among second-language
speakers.
Finally, though Wardaman and its congeners appear to share considerable vocabulary
and many typological features with Wakiman to the north (see Cook 1987), it cannot
presently be stated with certainty what the nature of the relationship is, although my own
view is that Wakiman is closely related to Wardaman-Yangman, and has diverged from
them partly due to influence from neighbouring Arnhem-area languages.
In certain basic ways, such as phonemic inventory, Wakiman differs significantly from
its presumed close congeners, Wardaman and Yangman: it has two stop series
intervocalically (e.g., a contrast between bilabials b and;?, apicals d and t, etc.); there is
no phonemic distinction between alveolar and retroflex apical stops, which is
fundamental in all the other languages; it has glottal stop, which is not even phonetically
of any significant occurrence in Wardaman, Yangman, or Dagoman, and so on. However,
when one considers the possible diffusional influences of neighbouring Amhem-area
languages on Wakiman in some of these matters, it still seems quite possible that its
closest congeners may be the Wardaman-Yangman-Dagoman grouping. Typologically,
in certain very significant ways, such as the syntactic deployment of what I call verbal4 Chapter 1""particles"" (see Chapter 9) and Cook calls ""participles"", Wakiman is very like Wardaman
and Yangman, and all of them taken together differ dramatically not only from regional
Arnhem languages like Jawoyn which do not rely on such verbal particles to any
significant extent, but also from languages like Mangarrayi which do. In Mangarrayi
(see Merlan 1982) the syntactic deployment of verb particles is very different from the
possibilities in Wakiman and Wardaman etc., and rather limited in comparison with the
latter grouping of languages.","[26, 27, 28]"

The most literal meaning of the verb particle nginngin seems to be 'to shake head no',
but ""refusal"" is also understood to be tantamount to being ""jealous concerning"", and
nginngin is often translated in this way in Kriol. The particle may enter into construction
with verb bu-, in which case both person refused and the thing concerning which refusal
is made, are typically Dative complements:

3SG-AUX-PSTnganu

food-DAT'He refused me food' [said no to me about food].
An overt nominal agent of nginngin bu- or na- could be Ergative-marked, but might
also be Absolutive (textual examples of both kinds exist). Similarly, many actions which
may be performed with respect to a complement require that it be Dative:

The usual form of construction in Wardaman is for Dative-marked nominal
complement to also be marked by independent Dative pronoun, and the latter in fact often
precedes the former in the clause. The nominal establishing identity of the Dativecomplement often occurs at some remove from the Dative pronoun, forming an
absolutely typical kind of loose linkage within the clause.

While wali-yi-, as (43) shows, occurs with Dative complement expressing person
concerning whom one's jealousy is aroused, there is a contrasting verb wali-na- (with
inseparable auxiliary na-, otherwise 'to see') which occurs in transitive clauses with the
person causing one to be jealous (rather than the one with respect to whom one is jealous)
treated as direct object.
Dative also marks the nominal complement in purposive clauses (see 11.4.).
Possessive phrases in Wardaman have a typical structure in which the possessor if
nominal is Dative-marked, if pronominal is expressed by the appropriate independent
Genitive pronoun; and the possessor, whether nominal or pronominal, is also marked by
a form of the Dative independent pronoun agreeing with nominal or pronominal
possessor. Ordering of these constituents is not strict: the Dative-marked nominal, for
example, may occur before or after the agreeing Dative pronoun (see further 10.4.). A
considerable number of examples, culled from texts, illustrating mainly nominal but also
pronominal possessors, is given. These are fairly similar in content and are chosen to
show, among other things, various ordering possibilities.","[94, 95, 96]"
"In short, whatever the function of the alternation may have been historically, it seems
not to be associable with a difference between grammatical categories now. Any
supposed levelling of a previous grammatical difference may have to do with the wide
distribution of the -ba ~ -ma verb class in the contemporary lexicon, where the suffix is
re-interpreted as a mark of predicate function per se, and not of contrast within the system
of verbal categories.
11.1.3. Negative imperative particle constructions
Positive imperatives are not ordinarily formed using the particle alone (as is apparently
the case in Wakiman, see Cook 1987:255). Thus, one usually orders someone, notduba
'sit down!' with particle alone, but dubajingi 'sit down!', with particle plus finite verb.
While the particle may occur by itself as imperative, this apparently has the quality of a
truncated or elliptical utterance.
Negative imperatives of particle plus finite verb constructions may be formed as usual,
that is, such constructions are identical to the Present Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms:
(646)wonggo
negduba
sityi-ni-jingi-n
IRR-2SG-AUX-PRES'Don't sit down!' 'You must not sit down!'.",[290]
"Word classes 5943. Finite verbs
Verbs obligatorily are marked for either subject alone, or for subject and object. A
maximum of two participant slots can be filled by pronominal prefixes. Other participant
roles are marked on external nominals but nowhere on the verb. Categories of tense,
mood and aspect are marked on the verb in the main by suffixation, but also (primarily
in respect of a mood distinction between realis and irrealis) by prefixes. Weak
subordination and other kinds of clause-level relations are expressed by suffixation to
finite verb forms.
Wardaman has at least 130 fairly common finite verbs (unlike Wakiman, which appears
to have only around forty, Cook 1987: 90). Among these are eight very high-frequency
CV verbs, a number of which can also occur as inseparable auxiliaries of compound verb
stems, e.g., bu- occurs as a verb in its own right meaning 'hit', but also as auxiliary in
banybu- 'to fill receptacle', dembu- 'to peck', werrenybu- 'to ensorcell', gardbu- 'to
wipe', and so on. Several classes of such ""compound verbs"" can be identified according
to the verb root. There are also many finite verbs which have a simple, i.e., noncompound, stem, e.g., bewe- 'to tread on', gorno- 'to fill', gene- 'to taste', and others.
Most finite verbs can occur with one or more ""verb particles"" to yield particular
meanings, while some finite verbs occur independently with full lexical meaning e.g.,
waja- means 'to leave', and is often used without particle; but may occur with particles
to create other meanings, such as narru waja- 'to dodge (weapons)'.","[82, 83]"
