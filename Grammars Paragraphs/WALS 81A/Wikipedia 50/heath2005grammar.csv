(686)613i-qre-\n-\ha-hi
3MaSgS-kill.PerfP-\3MaP10-\Dat-lSg
'He killed them-Ma for me.' (T-md)Here the 3MaPl object has a reduced, arguably V-initial allomorph (/-aen-/)
after the V-final verb (-sgra-), and we get VV-Contraction with /a-ae/
surfacing as e. It appears that this ""fusion"" of object clitic with stem-final V
permits an exception to the first person first rule. However, even here, some
speakers including my primary T-ka informant strongly prefer to allow the first
person first rule to apply, so instead of (686) they have i-qYCi-\0-hi-\taen, with
3MaP10 -\taen at the end.
In the combinations not involving a 1st person clitic, the common
sequence is dative-object. In other words, the object-2 slot is favored for
object clitics. One can account for the data by recognizing (684.b) as the basic
order, while allowing for subsequent ""fronting"" of a lSg or 1P1 form to initial
position within the clitic cluster. However, there are also some attestations of
object-dative order even when a 1st person clitic is not involved, so the
ordering is not rigid.
In the uncommon case where two objects and one dative co-occur, the two
object clitics flank the dative clitic, so we get object-dative-object order.
Some further examples each involving one dative clitic and one object
clitic are in (687). The verb glossed 'kill' can also mean 'hit hard, whack'.
(687.a-b) include a 1st person, while the others do not.

Discourse-functional particles and topicalization11.1TopicalizationA topicalized constituent can be placed before the clause proper. It has its own
accentuation in this position, may have ""comma"" intonation, and is essentially
external to the clause. If the referent in question is subject, object, etc., it is
expressed by a pronominal in the clause proper. In (689.a-b), the topicalized
nouns (masculine and feminine, respectively), correspond to the object clitics
within the clause proper.

OverviewA sketch of major highlights of Tamashek grammar here will provide an
overall summary of the morphosyntactic type of the language. This should
help non-Berberist readers to make sense of phrasal and clausal examples in
the main chapters. Scanning the text in Chapter 16 in conjunction with this
sketch is also recommended.
2.1 Recurrent morphosyntactic patterns
Abstracting from the complexities of the grammar, the central morphosyntactic
construction in Tamashek can be represented as (7).
(7)[X Y'...]where X is a phrase- or clause-initial element (word or particle), Y' is an
immediately following word, and Y' is a modification in the form of the
corresponding independent form Y. ""Immediately following"" means that no
word or fixed-order particle intervenes, though floating clitics that happen to
attach to X are allowed. I refer to the relation between X and Y' as a local
dependency. The relevant constructions are in (8), where ""verb"" refers to
inflected (=finite) verbs, and ""participle"" (used in subject relatives) is a special
form of a verb stem with subject number-gender agreement only.

suggests that the eventuality in question will inevitably happen at a later time.
Contextually it can be glossed 'eventually', 'inevitably', or just 'later on'.

13.1.213 Clausal subordination
Spatial adverbial clauses (' where ...')Spatial adverbial clauses ('where ...') are definite relative clauses. They have a
demonstrative adverb as the head, followed by cliticized Comit -\d. The
construction can be glossed literally ""here/there where ..."". The unmarked
adverbial in this construction is d-i-ha 'here'.

treatment typical of 3SgS LoImpfP verbs in definite relative clauses (compare
-t-attaes- in normal LoImpfP clauses). See χ-pcl Erasure (130).
There is frequent slippage of spatial into temporal contexts, or into more
abstract spatiotemporal or situational 'in the event that ...'. These clauses can
therefore abut on the domain of conditional antecedents.

13.2Purposive and causal clauses13.2.1Purposives ('in order that...') (y aAd, aAd, y)671The purposive clause is a simple relative clause under the scope of a Dative.
Canonically, it begins with y (prevocalic Dative allomorph), followed by the
unmarked demonstrative a, then any clitics. If there is no other clitic, Comit
-\d is added, then the remainder of the clause, with a Shlmpf verb. In other
words, this is a PP with a clause headed by Dem ά as the complement of the
preposition.
Since the purposive clause is finite, its form does not depend on whether
its subject is coindexed with the subject of the main clause. Thus (806.a-b)
have the same purposive clause ('that he see me'), though only in (806.a) is the
subject 'he' coindexed with the main-clause subject.

'She (just) sits (waiting) for the man to cook for her.' [K]67213 Clausal subordinationThe danger of confusing Future ad with the unmarked Dem ά of a relative
clause is especially great in this construction. When a clitic follows, Fut ad
reduces to ä- (§9.6.3), and Dem ά omits the following Comit -\d. If there is no
clitic, Fut ad is unreduced and Dem ά is followed by Comit -\d. One
diagnostic for Fut ad is a following Shlmpf verb, but the purposive too has a
Shlmpf verb.
However, the α in (806.a-c) before the clitic is clearly the Dem morpheme,
and phonetic [ad] in (806.d) is Dem a plus Comit -\d, not Future ad. The
Future morpheme would have been replaced by its non-clause-initial
counterparts (T-ka mar, R and K-d e) in this position. Furthermore, when the
purposive clause is negative there is no possibility of a future (mis-)reading
(807).

"68413 Clausal subordination13.5.1'prevent' (-vkkvs-)In the construction glossable 'X prevent [Y do...]', Tamashek expresses the
lower subject (Y) as a main-clause dative. This allows the complement to be
expressed as a VblN with no further marking of the subject. The verb -vkkvshas a primary sense 'take out, take away, remove', so the construction is
literally ""X take.away [to (=from) X] [doing...].""

can take a VblN or similar nominal as complement. In (837.b) we see that the
logical object of the complement verb is expressed as (clitic) object of 'begin'.

"10.4 Ordering of clitics
The basic ordering is that in (680).
(680)Clitic Order
1. host word
2. cliticized preposition (in extraction constructions such as relatives)
3. object and/or dative
4. directional
5. pronominal PPThe host is the clause-initial element that the clitics follow. In a simple
clause it is a preverbal particle (if present), otherwise it is the verb. In a relative
clause it is the clause-internal head, e.g. the head noun in an indefinite relative
but the demonstrative of a definite relative. In focalized and some subordinated
clauses, the host is the demonstrative-like element ά at the beginning of the
clause.
In clauses where a NP complement of a preposition has been extracted
(relatives §12.1, focalized clauses §12.2), and in subordinated clauses that
regularly include a cliticized Instrumental or Comitative preposition
(§13.1.1-2), the preposition cliticizes to the host (and precedes any other
clitics). Examples are (681.a-b).

clause begins with the reduced demonstrative a-\, which serves as host. The
first morpheme following it is the cliticized Instr preposition -\s. The next10.4 Ordering of clitics611clitic is 1P1 Dative A h a - n a j r (T-ka variant of Aha-naer). This is the correct
location for pronominal clitics (object, dative). In (68l.b), we have an even
more complex sequence with cliticized preposition, dative pronominal, object
pronominal, and directional. For further detail on the relative ordering of
object and dative clitics when more than one is present, see (684) below.
Directional clitics follow pronominals. The two directionals (Centripetal
Asdd or -\idd, and Centrifugal -Yin) are semantically incompatible and do not
co-occur. Both directionals have marked accents, unlike other clitics (which
have at most default accents). In (681.a), Centrip Aadd appears at the end of
the second word, then again (redundantly) on the third word. A simpler
example is (682).

(almost) generalize that when a short (or deletable) V and a full V come

than Berber term. It is the plural twairag of the Hassaniya noun ta:rg-i, which
denotes a (freeborn) Tuareg warrior. The Tuareg refer to their own language as
t-ae-ma:saeq-q (or variant, see below), a feminine noun based on a stem
-mdisaer- whose core sense is again 'Tuareg warrior'. The northern Berber
language name ""Tamazight"" is cognate.
Because Tuareg varieties are spoken by nomads and transhumants over a
vast area in southern Algeria, northern Mali, the north of the Republic of
Niger, and (more recently) in Burkina Faso, and because in a given local area
there are many tribal and caste divisions that have linguistic ramifications, it is
very difficult to decide whether we are dealing with a single ""Tuareg""
language (with many dialects), or two or more languages (each with some
internal dialectal variation).
One popular division of Tuareg is given in (3).

"7.3.1.5Heavy non-augment V-final -CvCCv- and -CvCvCCv-There are also some non-augment heavy V-final verbs. The number of such
stems is low, and they are dwarfed in number by the open-ended class of heavy
augmented verbs (§7.3.1.6, below). Schematic MAN-stem paradigms are in
(368). Ρ denotes the first C, in order to make C,-Gemination transparent.",[383]
"3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes
There is a pervasive interaction between ""syntax"" and ""phonology"" in
Tamashek, which allows us to make a strong case for a morphological view of
the grammar. That is, instead of a model of grammar that starts with an
autonomous abstract syntax, and then allows a phonological module to execute
more or less natural phonological adjustments to the outputs of the syntax,
Tamashek lends itself to a model where grammatical categories, linear
ordering, and phonology (segmental, accentual, and ablaut) are inextricably
intertwined.
The common denominator of the phenomena treated in this section is a
repeating ""figure"" of the type [X+Y...], where X is some phrase-initial word or
particle, and Y is a word whose phonological form is modified in this syntactic
context. The modifications of Y are mostly, but not always, interpretable as
reductions. The [X+Y...] groupings do not correspond to phrasal boundaries in
current formal syntactic models. For example, the combination [verb
+ subject] (excluding object) is not recognized as a phrase in any syntactic
theory I know of. Therefore even the phrasal bracketings relevant to the
morphophonological processes described here are idiosyncratic to Tamashek.
On top of this, the phrasal bracketings are not identical to those needed for
phrasal accent. For example, [verb + object] counts as a phrase for
accentuation, as does [verb + subject], but of the two only [verb + subject}
shows Prefix Reduction in the noun. Therefore converting ""syntactic"" phrases
to ""prosodic"" phrases by rebracketing, as a way of explaining how Tamashek
microsyntactic organization diverges from natural syntactic groups, will not3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes147work, at least if ""prosodic"" phrases are defined in a manner relevant to actual
prosody.","[165, 166]"
"2.11Representation of stemsFor nouns (and other non-verb stems), what you see is what you get. The Sg
form of the noun is the citation form. Most Sg nouns (masculine or feminine)
have a vocalic prefix, such as Sg -a- or -as-, preceding the noun stem. A
masculine example is α-basqkor 'old well'. Feminine nouns also normally
have a Fe prefix t-, and often FeSg suffix -t. An example is t-a-bsqqan-t
'burrgrass'. The χ accent indicates that penultimate accent is predictable from
the presence of suffix -t, which does not permit the usual antepenultimate
default accent.
For verbs, the true citation form makes use of ""v"" for short vowel, ""υ"" for
full vowel, and where appropriate more specific full vowels (usually u and i).
If the verb takes Augment -t-, the formula ""(+ -t)"" is added. The PerfP or Imprt
may be used as an informal citation form in some contexts (the PerfP is used as
the headword in the dictionary). Examples of the true citation form are -vwvt'hit' (PerfP -awaet-), -usvl- 'run' (PeriP -osael-), and -buffu- (+ -t) '(grain) be
abundant' (PerfP -abbuffae-t).
Verb classes (as opposed to individual stems) are represented as e.g.
-vCvC-, -vPPvC-, and -vPQvC-. Ρ and Q represent consonants, with PP a
geminate cluster and PQ a nongeminate cluster. In other words, Ρ and Q are
indexes of identity among C's. The same class may be represented as e.g.
-vCvC- or -vPvC- depending on context. For example, it may be stated that
-vPvC- has a LoImpfP stem -aPPdC-, using Ρ in -vPvC- in order to clarify the
source of the geminate in -aPPdC-.",[40]
"2.7 Clitics
Clitics are attached to the leftmost word of the clause (a complementizer, a
preverbal particle like Neg or Fut, a clause-initial verb, the head noun in an
indefinite relative clause, the demonstrative in a definite relative clause or in a
focalized clause). Head nouns of definite relatives, focalized constituents, and
topicalized constituents are treated as external to the clause and therefore do
not host clitics. I use the notation -\ for the boundary between a clitic and a
preceding word or clitic.
In a transitive clause, if the direct object is expressed by a pronoun, it
takes the form of an object clitic (16).

"8.6Verbal nouns8.6.1i-mm-aqksed-aen
3MaSgS-Mediop-cut.PerfP-Partpl.MaSgOrdinary verbal nounsA pure VblN is a nominal that denotes the relevant action or state in an
unbounded fashion: 'dancing', 'running', etc. The VblN often occurs as a
complement to a higher verb like 'begin', 'be/do a lot', or 'be ashamed to'
(§13.5). The larger construction often imposes a temporal bounding. VblN's
are also indispensable in cases where a verb (or VP) is focalized; in this case,
the verb is extracted and fronted in the form of a VblN, and its original place is
occupied by -vju- 'do, make' (§12.2.5). Some main-clause verbs ('prevent',
'begin', 'cease', 'go (in order to)', 'be ashamed to', 'do a lot', 'do many
times', 'do frequently') take VblN's as complements (§13.5). A VblN may
also be the subject of a clause.
The various types of light verb stem tend to have idiosyncratic VblN stem
shapes that cannot be unified into a single overall ablaut model. Since each
VblN pattern is associated with a specified stem shape, we can think of these
as cases of templatic rather than componential ablaut. That is, the lexical
segments (chiefly C's) are simply mapped into the C positions of the VblN
template. I will not bother to formalize these minor ablaut mapping patterns,
which should be readily apparent. On the other hand, heavy verbs (including
prefixed derivatives) do lend themselves to a componential ablaut model
(§8.6.1.4), with a basic vocalic melody and (for non-augment verbs) a
penultimate accent.
Most verbs have a basic masculine verbal noun (VblN) belonging to one
of the productive patterns described below.
There is often a feminine counterpart, with FeSg t-...-(t-)t or FePl
t-...-(t-)en circumfixed around the same stem that is used in the masculine
VblN. There are also various other nominals, usually feminine, that can be
used in verbal noun sense at least for specified verbs. Where the masculine
VblN has an exact feminine counterpart, the latter may function as an
instantiating VblN (denoting a single instance of the verbal type, e.g.",[525]
"3.4.5.5Penultimate VThe penultimate V of the stem is targeted by χ-pen, which forms part of the
ablaut of VblN's of non-augment heavy stems. Consider (93).

variants with α rather than a in the final syllable, like a-mlawlaw, since this
change does not affect accent.)
In (93.b), we have apparent final-syllable accent, but this is due to deletion
of a stem-final V, compare LoImpfP -t-lmtalli- and PerfP -aemtaella-. If we
order the association of χ-pen to the stem before Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29),
the form will come out correctly.
(93.c) shows that augment verbs, i.e. verbs that take Augment -t in most
inflected forms, do not have χ-pen in the VblN, even though the Augment is
not part of the VblN (or any other nominal).",[139]
"In addition to this full purposive-clause structure, it is also possible for a
simple dative VblN to be added as an adjunct to a main clause (809).

"3MaPl
2MaPlaemtaellae-n
t-aemtaellae-mThe Shlmpf /-amtalli-/ shows similar accentual behavior, allowing for the
deletion of word-final /i/: (Future) 3MaSg adl-mtall 'it will be confused', lSg
ad smtall-aeY, 3MaPl ad smtalb-n. LoImpfP forms are 3MaSg i-t-lmtalli 'it
is (often) confused', lSg t-imtalli-r, 3MaPl t-imtslli-n.
A further example is 'go south', PerfP 3MaSg 1-jjussa but lSg sjjuss-aeY
and 3MaPl ajjüssae-η. A causative example is 1-ss-ijja 'he bent his head', but923 PhonologylSg ass-ijj-aev and 3MaPl sss-ijjae-n. In all of these heavy V-final stems,
VV-Contraction converts /a-ae/ to ae (rather than e), effectively deleting the /a/,
in the lSg and 2Sg as well as 2MaPl and 3MaPl, but only after Default
Accentuation applies.
When VV-Contraction applies over a clitic boundary (40), the two V's are
both counted for purposes of Default Accentuation. For example, consider the
combination of stem-final α and the -\a- of a dative clitic (40.b). Thus
i-taw-aenna 'it is said' (passive, LoImpfP) plus 3Sg dative clitic -\a-s gives
i-taw-aenna-\0-s (attested T-md) 'it is called (named)...', with surface wordpenultimate accent.
Similarly, when 3rd person object clitics combine with a verb ending in a,
we get special clitic allomorphs and (depending on dialect) an i or e vowel
(§10.3.1). Although the special allomorphy makes the phonology less than
transparent, the i or e is treated as a contraction of two V's, both of which are
counted. This can be seen with a heavy V-final unaugmented verb like -rvbbu'bring up, raise (a child)'. In 3MaSg PerfPl-rrabba 'he raised, brought up (e.g.
a child)' we have default penultimate accent. If we add a 3MaPl object clitic
we get a postvocalic allomorph (e)-\n, arguably underlying Masn/, and the
result is (for T-ka) i-rrSbbe-\n 'he raised them-Ma', with surface penultimate
accent.
The contextually variable ordering of Default Accentuation and
VV-Contraction is also observable in PI suffixation in nouns. Consider the two
examples in (68), which are lifted from a much fuller data set in §4.1.2.13, see
also (39) and §3.5.3.3.
(68)Suffixal Plural of Nouna.
b.singularpluralglosse-m-aesli
ά-laedal-m-aesl-αη
i-laed-an'voice'
'fly (insect)'In (68.a), the PI has an underlying form /i-m-aesli-aen/. VV-Contraction
combines /iae/ as /a/ (39.a), and Lexical Accent Erasure (139) is triggered by
the loss of a V, giving / i - m - a e s l - a n / , which then undergoes Default
Accentuation to yield i-m-assl-αη with surface antepenultimate accent. By
contrast, in (68.b), Default Accentuation must apply first, giving /i-lseda-asn/,
followed by VV-Contraction (39.a), producing i-laed-αη. In the latter, my
convention is to write an acute accent, but the accent is neither lexical
(compare Sg ά-laeda) nor ablaut-induced, so it can only come from Default
Accentuation at an early stage in the derivation.
Clearly the interaction between Stem-Final i/A-deletion (29), VVContraction, and Default Accentuation is complicated. It is possible to account
for the data using phonological derivations as sketched here. However, the3.3 Accent93derivations involves intricate rule sequencing, with the relative order of
Default Accentuation and VV-Contraction depending on morphological type.
Additional interactions of accent with morphology, or more accurately
with morphosyntax, are described in §3.5.3. There we see that ablaut-induced
accent can be shifted (one syllable to the right) or deleted entirely in a
syntactically defined context, namely in definite relative clauses.","[110, 111, 112]"
"3.3 Accent95For example, laz 'hunger, famine' is unaccented, so accent appears on a
preceding preposition, as in dsev laz 'in the famine'. With an unaccented
bisyllabic preposition like jannsj 'above' (compare jannaj-i 'above me'), we
might expect #pnn3j laz with accent on the antepenult of the phrase, but
instead we get jannsj laz with accent on the final of the next-to-last word. This
applies to all [xx y] accentual phrases, with unaccented monosyllabic y, that I
have recorded. I conclude that it is a principle of Tamashek accentology.
Not all sequences of words can form accentual phrases. The major word
sequences that can (72.a) and cannot (72.b) form accentual phrases are given
below.
(72)Syntax of Accentual Phrases
a. combinations that form accentual phrases

demonstrative + verb or participle (if the demonstrative is the

b. combinations that do not form accentual phrases

noun + demonstrative(72.b) can be summarized as follows: a noun cannot form an accentual
phrase with a following word, even within NP's. Thus prosodic groupings
are independent of (pure) syntactic groupings.

accentual phrase, as in (73.a) above. If the clitic has a vowel, the accent may
end up on the clitic, as in a-\tset 0-aeks 'he will eat it-FeSg', cf. (73.c) above.
Suppose now that an accentual phrase has two or more syllables to the left
of the rightmost accent (whether the latter is lexical or default). If the phrase is
uttered smoothly, there is often a pattern of secondary accent on alternate
syllables counting back from this rightmost accent.
This applies even to over-long single words, such as t-ifarsassin-asn 'they
(=hides) are coarse' or l-t-ifarsassin 'it is coarse', where Default Accentuation
gives primary phonetic accent to the antepenult. A slight secondary accent may
be heard on the word-initial syllable, which is two syllables from the rightmost
accent. Secondary accents are not as reliable as rightmost accents, particularly
since they require the speaker to compute the accent of the entire long word
from right to left before beginning its articulation. In a case like 'it is coarse',
in actual discourse the speaker may begin the word as i-t-1..., since the second i
actually carries an underlying ablaut accent; in this event we may end up with3.3 Accent97[iti'fae'rjajiin] with adjacent-syllable accents. The ""regular"" pattern of
secondary accents is therefore most easily found in elicitation, especially when
the informant repeats an utterance.
In multi-word accentual phrases, the same basic pattern arises. In
particular, accented clitics like Centripetal -\idd or Centrifugal -\hin, and
accented pre-verbal particles like Past kaeld may have their lexical accent
overridden by the alternating accent rule. An example is (74), whose
underlying form is /a-\hin itaw-aev/. Default accent appears on the i, resulting
in the erasure of the lexical accent on the Centrifugal clitic and the appearance
of a secondary accent on the Future preverb. The same caveat about on-line
production variation made above for single-word forms is even more pertinent
here; the smooth rhythms of (74) are most often heard in repetitions.

pattern as with relativization, except that the verb has its full form (with all
relevant ablaut features). The ""preposition"" has now cliticized to the ά at the
front of the clause (750.a). Dative is merged with Instrumental as As in this
construction (750.b-c), as in relatives. Note the fortuitous similarity between
the resulting a-\s (Foe + Preposition) and 3MaSg dative clitic -\a-s. For other
uses of a-\s in focalization, see §12.2.6 below. (750.d) has fael 'on'.

12.2.4647Focalization of adverbial NPFocalization of a spatial adverbial is illustrated in (751). Adverbials are treated
like (covert) comitative phrases, so cliticized Comitative preposition -\d
appears after Foe ά. As in other spatiotemporals, -\d is omitted in the presence
of any other clitic (751.c).

see.PerfP-lSgS]It is important to distinguish a-\d (Focus morpheme a plus cliticized
Comitative d) from clause-initial Future particle ad. This can be tricky,
except in negatives, since Future ad reduces to a - before a clitic. In
otherwords, both a-\d (Focus and cliticized Comit) and ad (Future) appear as
[ad] without a further clitic, and as [a] in the presence of a further clitic. If the
following verb phrase contains a preverbal particle, or an inflected verb in a
stem other than Shlmpf or LoImpfP, the initial element must be interpreted as
a-\d rather than as Future ad. If the following verb phrase lacks preverbal
particles and has a Shlmpf or LoImpfP verb, the initial element is ambiguous
and must be interpreted in context.","[664, 665, 666]"
"4.1.2Morphology of gender and number markingThe maximal structure of an inflected noun is (140), in the linear order shown.
(140)Nominal Inflection
1. Fe prefix t2. vocalic prefix: Sg (-aS-/-3-, -α-, or -e-), PI -i(full vowel shortened in dependent stale by Prefix Reduction)
3. noun stem (subject to PI ablaut for some nouns)
4. inner Fe suffix -t5. outer suffixes: FeSg -t, MaPl -asn (-taen), FePl -en (-ten)This structure is idealized. The following departures occur:
a. Many nouns pluralize by stem ablaut without suffixation, in which case
slots 4 and 5 are empty (§4.1.2.15). Some nouns have both ablaut and plural
suffixes (§4.1.2.14), and some have suffixes plus phonological modifications
of the stem that fall short of normal ablaut (§4.1.2.7 through §4.1.2.12).
b. Some nouns entirely lack vocalic prefixes.
c. Some feminine nouns lack FeSg -t (and therefore, even if V-final, also
lack inner Fe suffix -t-). A very few feminine nouns lack both Fe prefix t- and
FeSg suffix -t, so they have no morphological gender-marking, while requiring
feminine agreement: a d d u n y a 'world' (variant asddunya, <Arabic), e i l e
'daughter'.
Some feminine nouns take a different Fe suffix -aet (instead of -t). Its
plural varies between -en and -aet-en (§4.1.2.5).
There are some problems involving morphemic segmentation and
identification when a t appears at the junction between stem and suffix. As we
will see, a t in this position can be taken as a separate morpheme (Fe inner
suffix -t-) or as a mere allomorphic increment between stem-final and suffixinitial C's. I take it as Fe suffix -t- for feminine nouns with which it appears
before both FeSg -t and FePl -en, hence singular -t-t and plural -t-en. Where
the t appears only with a PI suffix, I transcribe it as a suffix-initial C (MaPl
-tasn, FePl -ten). The awkwardness of the analysis is that feminine plural
suffixal [ten] is transcribed variously as bimorphemic - t - e n or as
monomorphemic -ten depending on the form of the corresponding Sg.",[181]

TextThe following text was recorded from a T-ka speaker in 2002. It was
transcribed from dictation, allowing the speaker to repeat the sentences. My
other textual material is transcribed from recorded dialogues, and the reason
for choosing monologue dictation in this case was to allow the speaker to
smooth out the accentual phrasing (which can be ragged in spontaneous
dialogue due to the fact that phrasal accents work from right to left. Where
they are clear, I use brackets here to indicate the accentual phrases of more
than one word, not (as in the grammar proper) to indicate syntactic bracketing.

Extraction processes12.1RelativizationThere are two cross-cutting axes of differentiation within relative clauses. The
first is that between definite and indefinite relative clause. This is a
fundamental distinction and has an effect on the form of the verb inside the
relative clause. The second distinction is between subject, object, and
prepositional relative, based on the syntactic role of the NP in the embedded
clause that is coindexed with the head. Subject relatives are expressed with
participles. Non-subject relatives are expressed with ordinary verbs, subject to
certain modifications in ablaut features and accent.
It is customary in cross-linguistic syntactic theory to speak of a head noun
(or NP), e.g. 'dog' in 'the dog that I saw'. In Tamashek relatives, it is more
useful to speak of the clause-internal head within the relative clause itself. In
a definite relative clause, this internal head is a demonstrative, with definite
reference, that is prosodically part of the relative clause rather than part of a
NP with the preceding noun. The demonstrative is appositional to the head
NP (if the latter is overt). In definite relative clauses, the u n m a r k e d
demonstrative is the Proximate with stem -ά.
In the case of an indefinite relative clause, the internal head is the head
noun itself, or (in the absence of a head noun) an indefinite demonstrative
with stem -Ί. In indefinite relatives there is no apposition since the head is
represented only in its relative-clause-internal manifestation.
Any clitics present within a relative clause proper are hosted by the
internal head. In other words, in indefinite relatives the clitics attach to the
head noun (or indefinite demonstrative if there is no head noun), while in
definite relatives the clitics attach to the definite demonstrative. This justifies
the view that this head is internal to the relative clause (whereas a head noun in
a definite relative is external to the relative clause).
The two constructions are therefore those in (708). The ordering of clitics
and preverbs will be discussed in more detail in later sections.

non-subject relatives. The indefinite forms shown are most common with
adjectival subject relatives ('a good one', etc., §8.5.4).
The accents in the definite demonstratives are audible in isolation (as
demonstrative 'this'), but in actual relative clauses they are overridden by
phrasal accents. The indefinite forms shown do not occur in isolation so there
intrinsic accent cannot be determined.
In a definite relative, unless there is a specific deictic sense ('this', 'that
over there'), the demonstratives shown in (709) are usual. For an anaphoric
sense 'that (same) one who/that...', the Anaphoric suffix -daer can be added to
the demonstrative: w-a-daer, etc. In (727.d), below, there is an example where
the demonstrative combines with a word meaning '(the) other', and this
combination as a unit functions as the internal head of a definite relative.
The forml used after lst/2nd person pronouns functions as definite, and
does not have a feminine variant t-i, so it should be distinguished from
Indefinite 1 (Feminine t-Ί). Examples of lst/2nd person 1 are in (710).

-\tAatt
AatThe major cut here is between -\e and the consonantal forms. The latter
have a basic form /-\tt/ (see below for a possible extra V). Schwa-Epenthesis
accounts for the variants with a. After Schwa-Epenthesis, the geminate is
simplified to t if adjacent to a C on either side.
The consonantal allomorphs behave as though they had a vowel (see
below for dialectal Ati), for purposes of Default Accentuation. Thus
anhaey-asqAq Ί saw him', accented on the word penult, as though from
/anhaey-aer-tV/. For T-ka, however, the lost V does not appear overtly in any
context. If necessary, Schwa-Epenthesis can insert schwa before the IM when
the latter is sandwiched between other C's, as in ... sAat t-aqqaen-aed '...by
which you built it'.
The e of the first column is, one presumes, in some sense the ""same"" e as
that resulting from contraction of stem-final α with the /ae/ of the other 3rd
person object clitics. Taking this (and the preceding observation about accent)
to a logical conclusion, one could posit a representation /tae/ for the 3MaSg
object clitic. When the initial t of 3rd person object clitics is deleted after an
α-final verb, the remaining /ae/ contracts with the stem-final /a/ in the same
way seen above. However, as a practical matter I will hyphenate the 3MaSg
object combinations as ...Ae.
Examples of Ae are PerfP t - s q r A e 'she killed him' (<t-3qra), LoImpfP
i-salhAe 'he made him weep' (c-sdlha-), LoImpfP i-tottAe 'he eats it' (<-tattfor/-tdttA-/), Imprt s-smm-aswAe 'give him another drink!' (<s-3mm-3saw
for/s-amm-aswi/), Imprt a r A e 'open-Sg it!' (<ar for /ari/). Examples of
variants containing t are 0-ojaeyAt 'he tied him', a-\tt awat-naet 'they-FePl
will hit him', i-firruAtt 'he inherits it'.
Initial /t/ or Dd in a clitic is subject to assimilation to a preceding stop (or
r , which hardens to a stop). The conversions are shown in (670). The
assimilations affecting /t/ in 3rd person clitics are identical to those affecting60610 Cliticsthe boundary between noun stem and FeSg suffix -t, see (30) and (31) in

cf. snhaey-aeqAqasn Ί saw them-MaPl' and snhaey-aeq-\qaey Ί saw youMaSg'.
Independent pronouns can be added at the end of the clause, in addition to
an object clitic, but they generally function as clarifying or emphatic elements.
I regard them as post-clausal. In the available examples, the post-clausal
clarifying elements form a conjunction of the type 'X and/with Y' (including
preposition ad 'and/with). The object clitic may subsume the two, as in Ί saw
you-Pl, you-Sg and him', or it may coindex only the first conjunct, as in Ί saw
you-Sg, you-Sg with him'.

perception verbs like 'see'. Somewhat more interesting are the transitives
listed in (609).

'leave, go from'
'be on (sth)'
'be in' (usually Resit -aha-)
'have' (usually Resit -aid-)
'exist' (usually Resit -slid-)
'lose'-vkku- 'go to' is the 'go' verb used with a specified destination, which is
expressed as the direct object. A PerfP example with object NP is t-akka
e-haen 'she went to the house'. Note that the object NP has no locative
preposition. The destination can also be expressed as an object clitic:
Skkas-nAt 'they-Ma went to him'. The verb can be passivized: 0-aetw-aekka
'he was gone to'. A reciprocal version: aenm-äekkas-n 'they went to each
other'. A different verb -vjlu- expresses intransitive 'go, go away, depart' with
no specified destination.
Likewise, -vfvl- 'go from, leave' takes an object NP denoting the
departure point. Example: i-faelAad baemasko 'he left Bamako (on the way5769 Verb phrases and other predicationshere)'. -\ad(d) here is the Centripetal clitic. This transitive verb, along with the
use of preposition r o r 'chez, at the place of in composite 'from X to Y'
adverbial expressions (§6.7), makes an ablative preposition unnecessary, and
Tamashek has none.
-vwvr- 'be on' takes a direct object, rather than a PP, to specify the object
or surface on which the subject rests. In the (positive) stative sense it occurs in
the Resit form -awdr-. An example with full noun as object: i-war t-s-hun-t
'he is on the stone'. An example with object clitic is i-wdr-\t 'he is on it-Ma'.
The passive sounded dubious to informants, but I was able to elicit a reciprocal
-nvm-vwvr-, 3MaPl PerfP: aenm-aewaer-aen 'they were on each other'.
-vhi> 'be in' takes an object NP denoting the object, region, or space in
which the subject is located. Example: n-aha e-haen 'we are in the house'. The
verb can also be used in extended senses of the type 'be produced (caused) by'.
Example: i-h-\e a-s-assuhu η Vrazzej 'strengthening of the livestock is in
(=is brought about by) it (=a pasture grass sp.)'. In positive main clauses it is
always in the Resit form, -vhu- is a defective verb with no imperfective stems
(§7.3.2.12). It occurs in many idiomatic phrases, for example with a nominal
denoting a personality trait or other characteristic as subject, and a human NP
as object, e.g. t-ah-\e ""t-ae-haeke 'he is generous' (lit. ""giving is in him"").
Another defective transitive verb is -νΐυ- 'have', the ordinary verb of
possession. It too appears (in positive sentences) in the Resit form -aid-. See
§7.3.2.14. One can extract the object to give sentences like e-haen miAtH-las-n
'the house [topic], who has it?' (i.e. 'to whom does the house belong?'). For an
alternative construction 'X be mine' etc. see §9.4.
Still another defective transitive verb is -νΐΐυ-, which combines with a
referentially empty 3MaSg object clitic to form an existential sense 'exist,
there is/are'. See §9.3, below, and §7.3.2.11 for the irregular morphology and
the dialectally variable omission or reinterpretation of the 3MaSg clitic.
The sense 'get lost' is expressed as (PerfP) 0-aeba-, with invariant 3MaSg
subject form (here 0 - before a) plus an object NP or clitic denoting the person
or object lost. Example: 0-aeba-\taet 'she got lost', also a common polite
expression for 'she died'. The 3MaSg subject is audible as i- in LoImpfP
i-t-iba-\taen 'they are (often) lost'. See §7.3.2.16 for more forms of this
defective verb.","[593, 594, 595]"
"823 PhonologyI use ν (double grave accent) in two situations. First, certain suffixes and
clitics require that the default accent be on the (surface) penult rather than
antepenult of the word, effectively shifting the default location one syllable to
the right. Some of these suffixes and clitics may once have had an additional
vowel that has been lost. In this event, modern penultimate accent would have
once been antepenultimate and therefore compatible with Default
Accentuation. The best example of this is 3MaSgO clitic allomorph -\tt in
dialects like T-ka, since a syllabic variant -\tti is attested dialectally within
Tuareg. Another example, more difficult historically, is FeSg suffix -t on
nouns. Compare the accent of masculine a-bsembaera 'Bambara man' with that
of its feminine counterpart t-a-baembaera-t-t 'Bambara woman'. If FeSg -t
were a reflex of *-tV, the original vowel would account (historically) for the
synchronic accentuation. However, I hasten to add that I know of no direct
evidence from other Tuareg varieties or other Berber languages that FeSg -t
was ever *-tV. For a list of the relevant suffixes and clitics see §3.3.1.1, below.
Secondly, I use ν when a verb-stem-final V has been lost, and where an
underlying antepenult with default (not marked) accent ends up as an accented
penult. It should be noted that the interaction of VV-Contraction (37) with
Default Accentuation is complex (§3.3.2, below). For example, in the
PerfP/PerfN paradigm of -vnsu- 'excuse', the lSg subject form is a n s e - r ,
while the 3MaPl subject form is ansas-n. The difference in accents is
observable when we prepose Neg waer, hence lSg war anse-γ Ί did not
excuse' with phrasal accent shifting to the preverb, but war anse-n 'they-Ma
did not excuse', where the accent remains fixed on the surface penult of the
verb form.
There is no phonetic difference among these accents. In phonetic
transcriptions I use [v1] to indicate accent, regardless of its grammatical source.
In underlying transcriptions, only lexical and grammatical (=ablaut) accents
are indicated: /v/.
An accentual minimal pair is ae-jasu 'walking past (VblN)' and ae-jasu
'calabash'. There are many verbs whose PerfP (Perfective Positive) and Resit
(Resultative) stems differ only in accent, e.g. PerfP 0 - ü j a j 'he went far away'
and Resit 0 - u j a j 'he has gone (=he is) far away'. This is because the Resit but
not the PerfP has an accent formative as part of its ablaut package. A more
exotic minimal pair involving verb stems is Imprt z-azar 'exhaust!' versus
Imprt z-azar 'put in front!'; the former shows resyllabification from -z-vzru(cf. dialectal variants z-azru, z-aezru), while the latter has a basic shape
-z-vzvr-.
Any word-form (stem plus any affixes and clitics) that can be pronounced
in isolation has a single primary accent on one of its final three syllables. If
there are two or more pretonic syllables, secondary accents (indicated in my
normal transcription by a grave accent 0) may appear on alternating syllables
counting back from the primary accent. Here I discuss accents within wordforms, before turning to phrasal accents (which may override word accents),
see §3.3.3, below.","[100, 101]"
"3.5.1Prefix Reduction of nouns (dependent state)An important morphological process affecting nouns is that associated with
dependent state (in French usually « etat d'annexion »). This ""state"" is a
cover term for the following syntactic positions: a) complement of a
preposition (dative, possessive, locative), b) compound final (in a few tight
compound constructions like that with erk 'bad', §5.2.4.4); and c) subject
immediately following an inflected verb. In all three cases, the noun in
question can be said to ""depend on"" an immediately preceding word or stem.
If a noun that has a vocalic prefix consisting of a full V (i.e. a noun
beginning with Sg α-, e-, t-α-, t-e-, or PI i- or t-i-) occurs in dependent state,
directly following the preposition, compound initial, or verb on which it
""depends,"" the prefix undergoes Prefix Reduction. There is no other
morphological indication of dependent state (for example, there is no casemarking of subject or prepositional complement), so Prefix-Reduction itself is
as close as we come in this language to structural case-marking. Note that
nouns that do not have a full-V prefix undergo no (audible) reduction of the
prefix.
I use the diacritic 1 before a noun to indicate that it has undergone audible
Prefix Reduction. I do not use the diacritic for other nouns (e.g. those lacking a
full-V vocalic prefix), even when they occur in syntactic positions associated
with dependent state.

"1.6 Fieldwork and other data
I have worked in northern Mali since 1986, including annual visits since 1989.
In 1986 and 1989 I worked chiefly on Hassaniya Arabic. From 1990 to 1998 I
concentrated on Songhay languages, and am still finishing up this work. From
1999 to 2003, however, I focused on Tamashek. I am simultaneously
completing a Tamashek-English-French dictionary which I expect to be
published by Karthala, Paris. I have put great emphasis on lexicography in this
project, and I have drawn heavily on lexical data in this grammar. I am
considering the best way to make my textual data available, perhaps in an
electronic format, in the next few years.
In the field, the first order of business was compiling a decent working
lexicon. I undertook systematic lexical elicitation, primarily in Timbuktu in
summer 1999 and autumn 2000, with emphasis on ecological vocabulary
(natural species and related terminology). With a lexicon of about 2500 items I
then undertook analysis of dialogue tapes that I had recorded over the years in
Timbuktu (T-ka and others), Gao (speakers from the Kidal areas), and
Hombori (speakers living in the Gourma, most of whom were ultimately of
Timbuktu or Goundam origin). I also made some recordings of Tamajak (and
Tadaksahak) speakers in Menaka. I commissioned preliminary transcriptions
and French translations of several of the tapes from government applied
linguists in Bamako, namely Rhali Ag Mohamed of DNAFLA (native of
Kidal) and Mahmoud Ag Oyett of IPN (native of Menaka). I later took these10I Introductiontranscriptions and the tapes back into the field and prepared corrected versions
of the transcriptions.
An outline of the grammar, focusing on the T-ka dialect, was developed
into a more comprehensive draft with a native speaker present in Bamako in
summer 2001. Modifications and additions were made thereafter based on
closer analysis of texts, and follow-up elicitation in summer 2002. In that trip I
also went over the Timbuktu-biased dictionary draft with a native of AnsongoGourma for several weeks. In summer 2003,1 went through the by now rather
large dictionary draft with a native of Kidal (Kal Unan tribe) then in Gao. Of
course some grammatical material was also gathered from the AnsongoGourma and Kal Unan speakers. I was able to work for about a week with a
speaker from the Gourma Rharous area, and few a few days each with
speakers from Kidal (Ifoghas), Immenas, and Tessalitt. In 2003, Mahmoud Ag
Oyett and I organized a three-day workshop for Tamashek applied linguists
and teachers in Gao, and I was able to glean some interesting dialectal details
from the participants.
The most urgent remaining task for the analysis of Tamashek is a fuller
study of phrase- and clause-level prosody based on recorded texts.","[28, 29]"
"[T-ka]
[R]There is normally only one focalized constituent. However, as in other
local languages, it is possible to embed a focalized clause in a 'why?'
interrogative. This is arguably a layered double-focus construction, but the
only Focus morpheme is associated with the internal focus (746).

'Why (is it) meat [focus] that he likes?' [Gao]The ά Focus morpheme is regularly omitted in WH-interrogatives (§12.3).
In my T-ka data, with this exception the morpheme is normally audible in
focalized constructions. In my Kidal-area data, omission is fairly common in
texts even in non-interrogative focalizations, though informants are always
willing to repeat the examples more carefully with the ά audibly present, so I
am inclined to interpret omission as due to a low-level contraction. My K-d
informant, in elicitation, allowed omission in subject but not other
focalizations. However, in my Κ texts (from other speakers), I did observe
omission of ά in object focalization as well as subject focalization.",[662]

'lily-trotter, jacana' (bird that can walk on water lily leaves)The verb in these examples can be identified as short imperfective, but
there is some ambiguity as to whether it is the inflectable Shlmpf or bare (in
the latter case it would be identical to the Sg Imprt). In (265.a-d) there is no
subject affix, and the compound is treated as MaSg for purposes of agreement,
but since the stem is C-initial we cannot exclude the possibility that an original
3FeSg prefix t- has been lost. In (265.e), there is clearly no subject affix,
making an identification as Sg Imprt possible. In (265.f-h), on the other hand,
there is an audible 3FeSg prefix, and the compound as a whole is treated as
feminine in agreement. Perhaps in (265.e) the unprefixed ""imperative""
functions as the masculine counterpart of such feminines.
The verb in (265.b) can mean 'look up' or 'go north, go away from river',
and cognates in some non-Malian Tuareg varieties mean 'go up'. Perhaps 'look
up (at sun)' is pertinent to this compound.
While the transcriptions in (265) shows word boundaries between verb and
noun, these compounds can function as simple stems. For example,
'woodpecker' (265.c) can be pluralized as kaewkaew-i-rbab-tasn with MaPl
suffix -taen. Note that i - r b a b 'tree holes' is already plural (by ablaut), so -taen
can only be taken as suffixed to the entire stem: [kaewkaew WbabJ-tasn.
As an example of the mutations that can occur with semi-transparent
compounds, consider the three variants in (266), all of which denote the same
bird (scrub-robin or similar species), t-a-rsat-t means 'bit of excrement, animal
dropping(s)'.

more difficult to segment, but aegu could be taken as a dialectal variant of
Imprt £ej 'make'. In the third, the onset resembles aegg 'son o f , but in such a
compound one would expect Prefix Reduction in the following noun. Both
segu and aeggu could further be taken as containing ü 'owner o f , in which case5.2 Possession and compounding271(266.c) could be parsed as 'son of owner of excrement (pellets)'. Plurals are
difficult to elicit, but I did obtain aeggu-t-a-rsad-en for the third one.
In (267), the verb is PerfP zajrat- rather than Shlmpf -zaejrset-.

'middle finger' (takes FeSg agreement)zajrat 'be long, tall' is an adjectival C-initial verb, hence its perfective

are identical.
In (268) we have a negated PerfN verb. The phrase is literally 'it was not
(= has not been) cut' (compare the English flower term forget-me-not). The
species denoted is a long, trailing vine.

PrepositionsTrue prepositions have the following features: a) they combine with a
following NP, which undergoes Prefix Reduction; b) they combine with
pronominal suffixes into fused forms (pronominal PPs); c) when the NP
complement of the preposition is relativized on or focalized, the preposition
cliticizes to the clause-internal head of the relative clause (in the case of
definite relative clauses this internal head is the demonstrative following the
head NP).
Pronominal PPs normally cliticize to the leftmost element capable of
hosting a clitic (verb, preverbal particle, demonstrative or noun functioning as
internal head of relative clause or focalized clause). In other words,
pronominal PPs are normally sentential clitics, like object and dative
pronominals and like directionals (Centripetal, Centrifugal). An example is
(269.a). However, when the pronominal PP is bracketed with a VblN that
functions, for example, as subject of a higher clause, the pronominal PP
remains bracketed with the VblN. This applies to dative clitics (269.b) as well
as to other pronominal PPs (269.c). For this 'may not' construction see
§13.3.3.

and pronoun. More details are given in the sections below.
There is no specifically ablative or allative preposition. Ablative sense
'from X' is expressed indirectly using the transitive verb (PerfP) -vfvl- 'go6.1 Inventory of true prepositions273from, leave (a place)'. Allative 'to X' can likewise be expressed by the
transitive verb (PerfP) - v k k u - 'go to'. With other verbs of motion or
conveyance, a non-directional locational adverb such as locative 'in the desert'
can be glossed contextually as ablative or allative. Preposition r o r 'at the place
of, chez' is regular in the first half of parallel constructions of the type 'from X
to Y \ with har 'until, all the way to' (§6.7) in the second half.

fall on the final syllable of the preposition. Even with unaccented
monosyllables, I know of no instance where the phrasal accent falls on the
penultimate syllable of a bisyllabic preposition like jannaj. However, with a
pronominal ending we get e.g. lSg jannaj-i 'over me', showing that there is no
fixed accent on the final syllable of the preposition (§6.5.4).","[288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293]"
"3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes157The reason why the 3FeSg subject forms are singled out for this special
treatment is not hard to see. For a Lolmpf like -tatt- 'eat', the 3FeSg subject
form is the only form that (after deletion of 3FeSgS prefix t-) has neither an
audible (and generally syllabic) subject prefix that would obviate Rightward
Accent Shift, nor a syllabic subject suffix that (after a monosyllabic stem)
could host a rightward-shifted accent. This applies not only to -tdtt- but to all
LoImpfP stems, since they are overwhelmingly C-initial. Admittedly, there is
one verb type, namely -vPvC-, that has two alternative LoImpfP stem shapes,
C-initial -t-aPPdC- and V-initial-aPPdC- (§7.3.1.1). In theory, the V-initial
variant would allow 3FeSgS prefix t- to be audible. However, given that
-t-aPPciC- and -aPPaC- are in free variation, and that 3FeSgS t- is zeroed
before a C, when we hear a verb form [taPiaC] there is no way to tell whether
this represents t-aPPdC- with audible 3FeSgS t- plus stem -aPPaC-, or
0-t-3PPdC- with zeroed 3FeSgS prefix plus stem -t-aPPdC-.
Since LoImpfP stems like -baddaed- 'stand up' retain the ablaut-induced
accent (from formative χ-pcl) even while erasing the ablaut-induced
lengthening (formative χ - p c l ) , producing -baeddaed- or with Rightward
Accent Shift -baeddaed- (e.g. in 3MaPl basddaed-asn), this morphological form
(i.e. LoImpfP in definite relative) is distinct from the Prohibitive stem, which
completely lacks χ-pcl as well as χ-pcl, hence -baeddaed- (e.g. waer basddsed
'don't stand up!', arguably with deleted It-/ prefix).
The cases we have considered represent the only verb stems where
Rightward Accent Shift runs afoul of a rule deleting stem V's. This suggests a
derivation for unaccented 0-tastt in (134.a) where Rightward Accent Shift in
fact does shift accent onto the stem-final /A/, whereupon Stem-Final i/ADeletion (29) zeroes the /A/, and the ablaut-induced accent on the zeroed V
disappears. Technically, we could think of this as a delinking of the accent,
which ends up with no vowel to attach to.
However, there is another construction involving accent erasure that must
also be considered before any rules are formulated. Like the process affecting
3FeSg subject definite relatives, this one involves erasure of a marked accent
when a stem-final V disappears. However, this time we are dealing with nouns
rather than verbs, the loss of the V is due to VV-Contraction (39.b) rather
than Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29), and there is no phonological reason why
the contracted vowel could not host the accent. Moreover, there is no reason to
think that Rightward Accent Shift is involved.
The relevant cases here are agentives of the type e-m-asqr 'killer', PI
""i-m-aeqr-an (§8.8.1), including causative agentives of the type e-m-aes-aeqq
'cook', PI i-m-ses-aeqq-an (§8.8.4), and VblN's of the type α-fsyk 'being
searched', PI Ί-fayk-an (§8.6.1.4). In these forms, there is a marked accent in
the Sg that disappears in the PI. These agentives and VblN's are based on
V-final stems, here - ν η γ υ - 'kill', -νηηυ- 'be cooked', and - f v y k u - 'be
searched'. In the Sg forms, we can assume that Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29)
has deleted a final V, so the surface final-syllable accent can be derived from a
(marked) penultimate accent (i.e. with χ-pen), e.g. underlying agentive1583 Phonology/e-m-aeqrV/ (where V represents either hi or IAJ) and VblN /a-fsyki/. This
underlying penultimate accent is consistent with the surface penultimate accent
of C-final agentives and VblN's. In the problematic plurals, it appears that the
VV-Contraction (39.b) of hi or /A/ with the suffixal vowel (MaPl -aen) forces
erasure of the marked accent, even though this accent is on the preceding
syllable, which is otherwise unaffected by the contraction. There is no
comparable erasure in agentives or VblN's based on C-final stems.
In summary, the 3FeSg definite relatives of type 0-taett for -vCCu- verbs,
and the plurals of agentives and VblN's for V-final verbs including -vCCi>,
have the following in common: 1) a V seen in the Sg is zeroed or desyllabified
(though by different rules: Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29), VV-Contraction
(39.b), Desyllabification, Syncope), and 2) the marked accent (i.e. an ablaut
formative of type χ) is simultaneously zeroed, resulting in default (including,
if necessary, phrasal) accent. If we interpret the erasure of accent in these two
cases as reflecting the same basic process, and seek to unify them into a single
rule, we must disregard the suggestion made earlier that (for the 3FeSg subject
definite relatives only) the accent erasure may be an unintended consequence
of the zeroing of the V that should have carried the accent. Instead, we need a
more abstract morphophonological rule (136).
(136)χ-Erasure
An ablaut χ (accent) formative is erased...
a. ... when a heavy V-final VblN or Agent nominal with χ-pen
contracts its stem-final V with a PI suffix (combinable with
Lexical Accent Erasure, below).
b. ... where an ablaut accent χ - p c l appears on a stem-final
deletable V {III or IAl), as this V is deleted or contracts
with a suffixal V (the only relevant cases are 3FeSg
LoImpfP verbs and participles in definite relatives)There are some additional nouns with marked lexical accent in the Sg that
is erased in the suffixal PI. This happens in several cases, whose common
feature is the deletion of a stem V (not the accented one) in connection with
addition of the PI suffix, either MaPl -asn or FePl -en. Consider (137).

In (137.a), a stem-final u in the Sg corresponds to a desyllabified w in the
PI. The V is therefore not deleted as such, but it loses its status as syllabic
nucleus. These are the only two examples known to me. In (137.b), which is
much more productive, Syncope is part of the mix in the PI. In the feminine
cases in (137.c), we cannot tell if the Sg has a lexical penultimate accent, but
one can infer from the unaccented plurals that they do not. In (137.d), an
audible stem-final V in the Sg undergoes VV-Contraction (39.a) in the PI with
the suffix-initial V. In (137.e), there is no audible stem-final V in the Sg, but
we might posit a deletable final V on the grounds that the MaPl takes the form
-an with full V (§4.1.2.13). In specific cases there may be additional evidence
for a stem-final V, e.g. for 'Fula man' in (137.e), cf. FeSg t-a-folli-t-t 'Fula
woman' with stem-final i (§4.1.2.4).
The cases in (137.d-e), where VV-Contraction leads to default accent in
the PI, are not typical. More often, VV-Contraction (39) has no apparent effect
on a marked lexical accent (138).

One might argue that χ-Erasure actually has applied in (138). This will
generate the correct forms in (138) if the order of rules is χ-Erasure, then
Default Accentuation, then VV-Contraction. However, this would decouple
χ-Erasure from VV-Contraction, in spite of the evidence in (137) for a1603 Phonologyconnection between loss (or desyllabification) of a stem V and χ-Erasure. In
addition, we would have to recognize a different rule ordering for the cases in
(137.d-e), with Default Accentuation following VV-Contraction.
For more examples and discussion of these Sg/Pl pairs, see §4.1.2.13. The
erasure rule is formulated as (139).
(139)Lexical Accent Erasure
A lexical penultimate accent on a Sg noun is erased if a vowel in
the Sg stem is desyllabified or syncopated, and (in some cases) if a
stem-final V (overt in the Sg, or deletable) is deleted.","[175, 176, 177, 178, 179]"
"8.6 Verbal nouns507feminine 'a jab' in contrast to temporally unbounded masculine 'jabbing').
Alternatively, the feminine VblN may have a more concrete sense (e.g. 'a
refusal', 'an entrance'); the nuances are specific to particular word-families.
For example, (PerfP) -vljvm- 'hit lightly on the nape' has a regular masculine
VblN a-laejam denoting the pure, unbounded action type, and a feminine
nominal t-a-lajjem-t denoting an individual blow on the nape. Likewise,
-urvm- (PerfP -orsem-) 'try, attempt' has a masculine VblN irrum 'trying', and
a feminine noun t-irrum-t (T-ka) or t-irmi-t-t (A-grm K-d) '(an) attempt'.
Some word-families contain several nominals, masculine and/or feminine.
For some verbs, especially those of basic shape -v(C)Ci> or -U(C)CÜ-,
there is no masculine VblN. For these verbs, one of the feminine nominals
functions as VblN (e.g. as complement to a higher verb), whether or not it also
has a more concrete sense.
A VblN may have a ""possessor"" denoting the object (536).

"12.2FocalizationFocalization involves highlighting (or interrogating) the choice of one element
in a clause, the remainder being backgrounded (presupposed or at least not in
play). Syntactic focalization in Tamashek is limited to NPs (including
adverbials and VblN's).
The focalized constituent is fronted to sentence-initial position. It is
normally followed by the morpheme a , interpretable as a minimal
demonstrative form but here labeled ""Foc[us]."" Any clitics that may be
present are hosted by the Foe morpheme, or if the latter is absent they are
hosted by the focalized NP. The remainder of the clause follows. The ablaut
reductions of Resit and LoImpfP verbs seen in definite relative clauses do not
apply to focalization, in spite of a certain syntactic similarity between the two.
Therefore, if the verb is Resit or LoImpfP, it occurs with its full ablaut
structure and normal accentuation, as in simple main clauses.
The pragmatics of focalization are illustrated in (743). The first clause
(negative) is unfocalized. The second clause, which specifies the real object of
desire, is focalized.

the subject is expressed on the verb. Thus ajjass-asn 'they-Ma entered', or with
explicit subject NP sjjaes-gen medd-aen 'men entered'.
A noun in subject function following its verb, or a noun functioning as
complement of a preposition, undergoes Prefix Reduction (§2.3, above). This
does not apply to an object noun, even when it immediately follows the verb.
Prefix Reduction in an immediately post-verbal noun is therefore diagnostic of
subject as opposed to object status, for those nouns whose pronunciation is
audibly affected by Prefix Reduction (i.e. those with vocalic prefix allomorph
a- or e-). Nouns whose vocalic prefix is already short, or that lack a vocalic
prefix, show no subject/object variation in form.","[36, 37]"

object for certain higher-clause verbs). The subject of the VblN clause is
therefore omitted. If the VblN has a NP object, the latter usually appears as a
genitive NP with Poss preposition an (example below with 'be ashamed').

"10.3Pronominal clitics10.3.1 Object clitics
Pronominal object clitics can follow a simple transitive verb. If the verb is
preceded by a preverbal particle (Neg, Fut, Past), a demonstrative head of a
relative clause (e.g. MaSg w-ά), or Focus morpheme a, the clitic follows the
first such item.
The forms of pronominal clitics show some allomorphic variation, chiefly
depending on postvocalic versus postconsonantal position. I will describe the
T-ka forms, then (at the end of the section) I will detail dialectal variation.
The 1st person object clitics are identical to the corresponding dative
clitics. The T-ka forms are in (667). For the syntactic and phonological
distribution of the allomorphs, and for non-T-ka variants, see the discussion of
dative clitics in §10.3.2, below.

represented as a 3MaSgO clitic on the verb.

either be stacked with the second relative modifying an NP inside the first
relative ('the cat that ate the rat that lived...'), or parallel, both modifying the
same head noun ('the man whom you saw who works in town'). Consider

"3.1.2.4Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (in verbs)A number of verbs have stem-alternations involving full V's, short V's, and
zero. These are the only unaugmented V-final verbs. For example, 'vomit' has
a PerfP -absa-, with 3FePl subject absas-naet 'they-Fe vomited'; I take its basic
lexical form to be -vbsu-. The Shlmpf is -zebs (e.g. Sg Imprt aebs 'vomit!')
without the final V. The Shlmpf combines with 3FePl subject suffix -naet as
absa-naet, with a stem-final a that also induces an assimilatory (i.e. harmonic)
change of stem-initial /ae/ to a. It also combines with 3MaPl subject suffix -aen
to give sbsa-n. I take the basic (lexical) form of the Shlmpf to be /-aebsi-/,
ending in an underspecified high V ""i"" that is deleted without trace wordfinally (i.e. where no subject suffix appears). The hi contracts with the /ae/ of a383 Phonologyfollowing V-initial subject suffix to form 3, in effect transferring its [+high]
feature to the surviving short V. The hi surfaces as a before C-initial subject
suffixes like 3FeSg -naet.
A good case can be made for a parallel underspecified and deletable low V
that I write IAI. This occurs only in long imperfectives of a subset (namely,
bisyllablic -vCCu-) of the same V-final verbs that have h i in the short
imperfective (preceding paragraph). The LoImpfP in question appears as
- P d Q Q word-finally (i.e., with no subject suffix), as in -bass 'vomit'.
However, when a C-initial subject suffix is added, we get forms like 3FePl
bassas-nast with a stem-final low V, and this is the main evidence for a
representation of the type /-bdssA-/. When a subject suffix beginning in as is
added, we get forms like 3MaPl bdssae-n, which could be generated with or
without a stem-final /A/, but which I take (by parallelism to the short
imperfectives) as due to contraction, i.e. /bassA-asn/ with the IAI transferring
its [-high] feature to the surviving contracted V. In sum, the evidence for IAI is
weaker than that for hi, and IAI occurs in the paradigms of a subset of the
stems that have hi.
For more on these unaugmented V-final verbs see §7.3.1.3.
Both final hi and IAI in these verbs correspond to ""u"" in the corresponding
forms of Niger Tamajak (LTF2 424, class I.A.7-ll,e.g. Imprt ""zeknu"" and
LoImpfP ""ikannu"" for 'do well'). However, Foucauld's data do not have a
final V in such forms as ""iläss"" for 'he dresses' (DTF 4.2020) and ""ed iken""
for 'he will do well' (DTF 2.821).
Synchronically in Tamashek, one might equate stem-final hi with a, and
IAI with ae, noting that {a ae} do not otherwise occur as stem-final segments.
However, these equations are not transparent, and the fact that the verbs in
question have stem-final full V's in the perfective and long imperfective stems
makes it difficult to justify short-vowel representations for hi and IAI. No
other stems or words in the language end with short V's.
If we were to identify hi and IAJ with full V's (the only V's that otherwise
occur in stem-final position), hi should probably be identified with i rather
than with u. This is because there are some verb classes with a non-deleting
final u, either in the imperfective forms only or in both perfective and
imperfective stems. For example, the verb 'cough' appears as -asu- in both
PerfP and Shlmpf stems (§7.3.1.4). This u does not delete word-finally, and
contracts with /ae/ at the beginning of a subject suffix to form u rather than a,
as in asu-n 'they-Ma coughed' from /asu-aen/. This true stem-final u therefore
has no phonological similarity to III. However, there is only one verb with true
i in the Shlmprt stem, namely -Iwi- 'be born'. Since this verb has a /-iCi-/
shape not found with any of the verbs that I analyse as having final hi in the
Shlmpf (and IAI in the LoImpfP), one could imagine identifying III with i and
trying to connect the phonological differences in some way with stem shape.
However, again this is a somewhat convoluted argument, and I prefer to think
of hi and IAJ as abstract segments with vowel-like properties.
The deletion rule may be formulated as (29).","[56, 57]"
"7.3.1.14Non-augment -Cu(C)Cv- and -CvCuCu- verbsIn §7.3.1.3-8 I described regular (non-adjectival) verbs with exactly one full V
(counting stem-final V's as full). In this section I describe non-augment verbs
with both a medial full V and a stem-final V. These verbs essentially combine3967 Verbal morphologythe features of verbs with a medial full V (§7.3.1.7) and those of heavy nonaugment verbs with a stem-final V (§7.3.1.5). Sections §7.3.1.15-16, below,
cover other types of verbs with two full V's, viz., verbs with both an initial full
V and a final V, and augmented verbs with both a medial full V and a final V.
The basic shapes covered in this section are middleweight -CuC(C)i> and
superheavy -CvCuCo-. I begin with the middleweight subtype -CuCCu- with
medial cluster. The lexical medial V is always u rather than i (or a) in my
data. Examples are in (394).

α-jajj, jasjjaa-jüssIn both 'load' and 'go south', we have perfectives based on -aPPuCCa-,
produced from -PuCCu- by application of <H L> melody, plus Stem-Initial
V-Insertion, and Ci-Gemination (§3.5.8). As usual with perfectives that have
a stem-initial short V followed by a syllable containing a full high V, dialects
other than T-ka and A-grm have initial ae instead of a, thus -sejjujja- and
-aejjussa- in those other dialects.
The two verbs in (394) diverge in the melodies used in the short and long
imperfectives. 'Load' has an imperfective <L> melody while 'go south' has
<H>. In the short imperfective, the hi at the end of /-aejjajji-/ is deleted stemfinally (without subject suffix), appears as a before C-initial subject suffix, and
contracts with /ae/ at the beginning of V-initial subject suffixes to produce a.
Sample inflected Shlmpf forms are 3MaSg ad 0-aejjajj 'he will load', 2Sg ad
t-aejjajja-d, and 3FePl aejjajja-naet. In the long imperfectives, both verbs show
Medial V-Shortening, and the final u of - t - i j a s s u - is due to u-Spreading7.3 Verb classes and irregular verbs397(§3.5.9). The two verbs diverge again in the VblN's, where only 'load' applies
Medial V-Shortening. The 'go south' type is more consistent with the vocalism
of-CuCCvC- verbs like -hussvl- 'be obligatory' (§7.3.1.7).
The other verb of the 'load' type (394) is -bubbu- 'carry (baby) on back'
(PerfP -abbubba-, Imprt babb, LoImpfP -t-abaebba-, VblN a-babb or bsebba
(also α-bübb for K-d). The verbs 'sit' and 'testify' in §7.3.2.9-10 have some
idiosyncracies but have similar MAN stem paradigms.
The other verbs of the 'go south' type (394) are -fuggu- 'be detached' (e.g.
LoImpfP -t-lfaggu-, VblN α-fugg) and - j u r h u - 'end up' (e.g. LoImpfP
-t-rjarhu-, VblN a-jurh).
'Load' and 'be detached' have reported cognates in Niger Tamajak, where
they appear to have the same conjugation (LTF2: 59, 83, 441), including VblN
""aCCaCCi,"" Shlmpf ""äCCäCCu,"" and LoImpfP ""-taCäCCu."" For Algeria,
DTF 1.406 has forms for 'load' including 3MaSg PerfP ""iego'ugga"" and Imprt
""gagg"", and similar forms are given for 'carry (baby) on back' DTF 1.16,
while 'be detached' has Imprt ""fouggou"" DTS 1.308, so Algeria at least has a
split like that in Malian Tamashek. 'Load' has a counterpart in Songhay
(jeeje), and 'carry (baby) on back' is a widespread West African word found in
most Malian languages; I am not sure which language is the original source of
either item.
A verb meaning 'be sterile' has a related paradigm, but my T-ka data
show a mix of non-augment and augmented forms: PerfP -ajjujra- or
augmented -ajjujrae-t, Imprt jüjra-t, LoImpfP -t-ijajru- or augmented
-t-Tjajru-t, abstractive nominal ajjajru. The imperfective vocalism links this
verb with 'go south' in (394). The instability is due to the fact that jr is an
unstable word-final cluster, in that the r is more sonorous than the j. This
would be a particular problem in the Imprt, where non-augment /jujri/ should
appear as #jujr after Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29) (§3.1.2.4). This would
require resyllabification by Final-CC Schwa-Insertion and (in T-ka)
Epenthetic-V Accentuation to #jujar. Adding Augment -t makes it possible to
avoid this resyllabification.
The A-grm speaker gave a different paradigm for 'be sterile', not involving
Stem-Final i/A-Deletion: PerfP -aggagra-, Imprt gsegru, and LoImpfP
-t-agaegra-. For K-d I elicited PerfP -sejjujrae-t but could not elicit
imperfectives (the verb denotes a stative quality and therefore appears most
often in the Resit, in the perfective system). The R informant did not recognize
the word.
I now turn to verbs that have a basic middleweight shape -CoCu- with
ungeminated medial C. These verbs cannot undergo Medial V-Shortening,
which requires a CC cluster after the medial full V. Most of the verbs also fail
to apply Q-Gemination in the wake of Stem-Initial V-Insertion (perfective
system, Shlmpf). The most striking feature of these verbs, however, is a midheight V {o e) in the perfectives. The avoidance of C,-Gemination and the
perfective mid-height V link these verbs to -CuCvC- verbs.","[414, 415, 416]"
"1.2 Literature on non-Tamashek Tuareg
For Tamahak (Algeria), the major work is the great Dictionnaire touaregfrangais (abbreviation DTF) of the famous (and famously assassinated) French
officer and later missionary Charles de Foucauld (lived 1858-1916). DTF was
published posthumously in four volumes (1951-52). It is now somewhat
difficult to use because of its rarity, its great physical size (the handwritten
manuscript was published by photography), and its not very modern
orthography (""ou"" for w, ""i"" for y, ""r"" for Y, etc.). Foucauld had a hard time
hearing the distinction between the two short vowels, and did not understand
the accent system. Nevertheless, his dictionary is monumental, and its entries
contain rich semantic detail with abundant exemplification, and not a little
ethnographic material. Foucauld also made a serious effort to identify natural
species. It is one of the greatest of all missionary dictionaries of its era.
For Tamajak (Republic of Niger), the major work is the Lexique touaregfrangais of Prasse et al. (2nd ed., 1998), which carefully distinguishes
Tawellemett (""W"") from Tayert (""Y"") items throughout. This dictionary is of a
high standard, uses a modern phonemic orthography, and has the necessary
morphological data for each stem. Two shortcomings that will hopefully be41 Introductionrectified in future editions are the absence of scientific identifications of florafauna species, and the omission of accents on stems other than verbs (verbs
generally have grammatically predictable accents).
For Burkina Faso we now have David Sudlow's handy work, The
Tamcisheq of north-east Burkina Faso (2001), which includes some lexical
lists organized by domains as well as grammatical information. The migrations
into Burkina began in earnest around 150 years ago and have been continuous,
as desertification has pushed Tuaregs south. The dialects spoken in Burkina
reflect the diverse origins of the migrants, but Tawellemett is well represented.
Prasse's three-volume work, Manuel de grammaire touaregue (1972-74),
is an elaborate systematization of data from Foucauld from the Hoggar. In this
work, Prasse analyses Tuareg phonology and morphology (the fourth volume
on syntax did not appear), in historical linguistic terms. The Manuel is an
important work for Berberists, but the author's perspective is somewhat
idiosyncratic, since he connects attested modern Tuareg forms directly with
Pre-Proto-Berber reconstructions. Much of his interest was in presenting a PreProto-Berber reconstruction with three short vowels in addition to the less
controversial long (full) vowels. Synchronically, Tuareg has two short vowels
ae and a, which are themselves partially merged in some dialects depending on
following consonants, and the non-Tuareg Berber languages generally have
just one short vowel phoneme. Unfortunately, the Manuel was written before
the author's Niger-based Lexique,
and was therefore based largely on
Foucauld, whose transcriptions of short vowels for Tamahak were highly
unreliable. In addition, the Manuel (like the Lexique) was written in the
absence of good synchronic analysis of accent, which turns out to interact in
significant ways with the ablaut system. In general, the Manuel is of greatest
interest for its analysis of vocalic ablaut, and of a series of other, specific
historical linguistic issues.
Another important recent work on Proto-Berber is Maarten Kossmann's
Essai sur la phonologie du proto-berbere
(1999). This is essentially a
collection of topical studies, addressing a number of cruxes of Berber
historical phonology.","[22, 23]"
"3.1.1.3Uvulars (r q)q is common as a phonetic entity but has marginal phonemic status. Most cases
of phonetic [q] are in the geminated form qq, word-medially or -finally, and
these can be interpreted as the phonetic realization of geminated / r r / , The
conversion of /YY/ to q q is productive, and applies not only word-internally
but also over word boundaries (§3.2.1.1).
Within words, we have cases of morphological gemination such as
/i-avmbb-aet/ >l-qqubb-aet 'he gulped', cf. verbal noun a - r a b b u 'gulping'.
At a nonprefixal morpheme boundary (with a suffix or clitic), q q often
represents Μ or IrkJ, as when a morpheme otherwise ending in γ is followed
by a morpheme otherwise consisting of or beginning in t or k (e.g. FeSg -t,
3MaPl object clitic -t, or any of the pronominal clitics beginning in k). An
example is the name of the language, / t - a 2 - m d : s a e v - t / > t-£e-ma:saeq-q
'Tamashek'; see §3.2.1.1 for more detail. In these cases, the effect is a
bidirectional feature assimilation whereby the t or k adopts the uvular position
of the Y while the latter adopts a voiceless stop articulation.
At word boundaries, we have such examples as preposition dser 'in' plus
any noun beginning in Y, e.g. DA2Y Yussast 'in August', often pronounced
[dajqiu'J'iaet]. Another recurring combination is a verb ending in lSgS -3ΪΥ
followed by particle Yds 'only'.
While /YY/ is regularly realized as qq, there are hints that ungeminated q
may be on the way to becoming a phoneme distinct from Y. This is because q
as well as γ can occur in ungeminated position. While γ is much more
common, there are some cases of q in Arabic borrowings, as in PerfP -aqbael'consent' (imperative aqbal, LoImpfP -qdbbael-, cf. noun aelqabdla, all from
Arabic qbl 'accept'). Contrast this with a native stem like -SYbaer- 'kick with
heel' (Imprt 3Ybsr, LoImpfP -Yabbaer-). There are also dialectally sporadic
cases of ungeminated q in non-borrowed vocabulary, especially where back-263Phonologyformation from geminated qq may be involved. An example of internal backformation is the verb 'sit' (§7.3.2.9), which often appears in the perfective or
resultative stem, which involve gemination to q q (PerfP - a j q q i m a - , etc.). For
some speakers we also (by back-formation) get ungeminated q rather than γ in
forms like Imprt q a y a m (variant q a m ) alongside r a y m , where I interpret the
variants with q as influenced by the qq of the perfectives.
In the combination η γ , often representing alveolar η plus Y, the γ
approaches the stop articulation [q], or an affricated articulation that sounds
like phonetic [q Y ]. The most common case is the verb 'kill', P e r f P -aqYa[-sqq^a-], but e.g. VblN t-e-naeYe with intervening vowel. I do not use "" q ""
here in phonemic transcriptions, since I am not convinced that the segment in
question is completely voiceless in this position; an instrumental phonetic
study would be useful. N o similar affrication occurs in m r , e.g. i - n w a d
'vassals' (PI of a-m3Yid).
While there is incipient phonemic splitting of q and Y, the alternation of
ungeminated γ and geminated q q remains quite fundamental. For purposes of
alphabetizing dictionary entries, I treat q as though γ (i.e. immediately
following g).","[44, 45]"
"2404 Nominal and pronominal morphologyProximal demonstrative 'this' (near speaker) requires addition of suffix
-hi (w-a-hi etc.)· A Near-Distant demonstrative (e.g. near addressee or a short
distance from speaker and addressee) is expressed by the series ending in -di.
(For the R dialect I recorded wae-di etc. with ae instead of a.) This can also be
used anaphorically to denote something not physically visible or otherwise
present. While MaPl w-i-di and FePl t-i-di are clearly tri-morphemic, MaSg
wa-di and FeSg ta-di are more ambiguous; one could take the schwa as part of
the gender marker, as epenthetic, or as an irregular reduction of the -a- seen in
the unmarked and proximal demonstratives. A specifically Distant
demonstrative is expressed by -en, which contracts with the preceding V (Sg
-en from /-d-en/, PI -1-n from /-1-en/). The normally Proximal suffix -hi can be
added to -di or -en, but these combinations are uncommon.
The w- of Ma[sculine] forms supports Prasse's view that the MaSg
nominal prefixes α-, e-, and ss- on nouns were originally *w-a- and *w-ae-.
The most common way to indicate anaphoric (=discourse-deictic) status
(e.g. 'this/that same one we were talking about') is by adding Anaphoric
suffix -daer to the demonstrative, often (but not always) the unmarked
demonstrative: w-a-daer, less often w-en-daev, etc. However, (214.a) also
shows a special Recent Anaphoric demonstrative, with ending -nnin, used to
denote something mentioned earlier, but not the currently active ""topical""
referent. In context it can sometimes be glossed as 'the former', as when
discourse referents R and S have just been introduced (in that order) and the
speaker then wishes to index R. It can also be glossed 'the preceding one'. It
has a variant -ndln, which is more transparently related to and! 'before'. The
form andln is also used as a postnominal demonstrative (see below, §4.3.3).
For invariant ά in connection with focalization, see §12.2.
Another set of demonstratives is used to provide heads to indefinite
relative clauses that lack noun heads (§8.5.4, §12.1). The forms are repeated
here as (215). The form i is also used in relatives (arguably definite, though
there is no definite/indefinite distinction here) whose head is a 1st or 2nd
person pronoun (§12.1).

χ-pcl, χ-pclThere is a subtle difference between the Resit and LoImpfP patterns. The
Resit always respects the shape of the PerfP, the most basic form of the
perfective system. The χ-pcl and χ-pcl formatives therefore follow a CC
cluster in verbs like 'get' and 'be enough'. In the long imperfectives, on the
other hand, there is always a V after the first C of the stem, or (if present) after
the -t- prefix. This means that the input to some of the long imperfectives must
be reconfigured (§3.4.1.5, above) from the usual shape seen in the perfectives
and short imperfectives. For example, -vjrvw- 'get' is reconfigured as -jvrvw-,
and -vbsi> 'vomit' as -bvsu-, in order for the ablaut formatives to apply
properly as they are formulated here. For light stems like these, one could also
consider a templatic model for the long imperfectives, which might obviate
this problem. However, the heavy stems are easily generated by taking the
Shlmpf as the input to LoImpfP ablaut.
For the most part, χ-pcl and χ-pcl target the same vowel, to the point
where one might consider merging them into a single formative. However,
cases like the Resit of 'be enough' in (89) show that χ-pcl can occur in the
absence of χ-pcl, in connection with adjectival verbs as illustrated here, but
also in definite relative clauses where χ-pcl is erased. See just below on
""jurisdictional"" issues between ""first postconsonantal V"" and ""V of final
syllable of stem.""","[135, 136]"
"4.1 Noun morphology193This rule ordering, though necessary for the very productive type (169.b)
and consistent with (169.a), is challenged by the handful of examples in
(169.C). Here, Default Accentuation appears to apply to the output of
VV-Contraction, so the PI has a default accent on the surface antepenult
(which corresponds to the underlying fourth syllable from the right). The
nouns in (169.c) are ""cultural"" vocabulary, and all are problematic. Only one
of the antepenultimate-accented plurals ('black turban cloth') is attested
outside of a narrow dialect area, and this one has a variant Sg ά-laessaew.
Some phonologically more complex cases are given in (170).

'pretext'In the feminine noun 'water lily tuber' in (170.a), the PI shows
antepenultimate accent while the Sg has penultimate accent. This indicates that
the stem has no lexical accent, gets the default antepenultimate accent in the
PI, and in the Sg has penultimate accent conditioned by the FeSg suffix -t
(§3.3.1.1, §4.1.2.1).
In (170.b) we see u in different syllables in the Sg and the PI. One
possibility is that this is another case of a shifty u (§3.4.9). However, i-sur-an
could also be a mixed suffixal-ablaut PI with <H L> melody, whose u reflects
the amalgamation of the α vowel of the Sg with the Η part of the melody. In
this view, the u of the PI has nothing to do with the u of the Sg.

What is notable about the cases in (171.a-c) is that the PI has default
accent while the Sg has a grammatically marked accent on the final (which
corresponds to the penult of the suffixal PI). In effect, the Sg accent is erased
in the PI, allowing Default Accentuation to apply to the latter. This is quite
unusual in Sg/Pl pairs, whether the PI is suffixal or ablauted.
The verb stems associated with the nominalizations in (171.a-c) are of the
shape -aC(C)a- in the PerfP and /-aeC(C)i-/ in the Shlmpf. The underspecified
high V segment III is deleted word-finally by Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29)
(§3.1.2.4), and is deleted by VV-Contraction (37.c) when followed by a
V-initial suffix or clitic (37, 40). In relative clause contexts, in those positions
where Rightward Accent Shift (132) (§3.5.3.2) would be expected to shift
accent onto the /i/, but where the III is (then) deleted, χ-Erasure (136) applies
(§3.5.3.3) and we get a default accent (if necessary, on the preceding word in
the accentual phrase).
Something related seems to be happening in (171). The verbal nouns in
(171.a) belong to types showing <H> stem melody and with marked
penultimate accent, so we can take the Sg forms to have representations like
/a-tw-ajji/ 'being done', ending in underspecified high vowel hi. In the PI
/i-tw-ajji-aen/, the hi is lost by VV-Contraction (39.b). Even though the III is
not itself accented, its loss appears to trigger χ-Erasure. This produces
unaccented /i-tw-ajj-an/, which surfaces with default accent as l - t w - s j j - a n .
The remaining cases in (171.a) have similar derivations. However, a-s-sksnn
' s h o w i n g ' shows some additional morphophonology in the Sg
(resyllabification by Final-CC Schwa-Epenthesis, accompanied by Stem-Final
Gemination) that does not apply to the PPi-s-alcn-an.
The agentives and related nominals in (171.b) can likewise be assigned
representations of the type /e-m-aerti/ 'tree' ending in III. The plurals are
derived in the same way as those of the verbal nouns, as shown in (172).","[211, 212, 213]"

"Negative particleverbablaut changec.definite demonstrative

participleablaut change
ablaut changeIn (8.a), a morphophonological rule Prefix Reduction (e.g. -a- reduced to
-as-, or -i- reduced to -a-) applies to nouns in combinations with specific
preceding forms. Of special interest is the fact that reduction applies to the122 Overviewverb-subject sequence, but not to a verb-object sequence. For more on the
role this plays in ""case marking,"" see §2.3, below.
For verbs, the only true local dependency is that of an inflected verb on a
preceding Negative (8.b). This applies in all combinations where no elements
(other than floating clitics) intervene between the two, hence to perfective,
(long) imperfective, and imperative (i.e. prohibitive) stems. Basically the
modification converting Y to Y' adds phonetic content (where it is not
vacuous) in the perfective, reduces phonetic content (erasing a V-length ablaut
formative χ-pcl and an accent ablaut formative χ-pcl) in the imperfective and
prohibitive, and modifies the stem vocalism in all of these stems.
The cases in (8.c) are limited to definite relative clauses, which begin
with a definite demonstrative (in apposition to the head NP, which if overtly
expressed is external to the clause). The modification in ablaut form of the
verb involves erasure of a V-length ablaut formative (χ-pcl), and (with
specific exceptions) a shift in the location of the ablaut accent formative (in
one combination, this formative is entirely erased). The formulation of the
relevant rules requires an extraordinary interpenetration of ""syntax"" and
""phonology,"" and constitutes an important empirical argument against highly
modularized theories of grammar.
It is possible to combine two [X Y'...] configurations, as in the
combination [Negative verb noun(subject) ...]. In this combination, the
relevant pairs involving local dependencies are [Negative verb] and [verb
noun(subject)]. As a result, internal bracketing as in [Negative [verb
noun(subject)] ...] or [[Negative verb] noun(subject) ...] is counterproductive
(any such bracketing would appear to separate two forms that enter into a local
dependency). The only points that matter are adjacency (disregarding clitics)
and the grammatical relationship (e.g. Negative + verb, or verb +
noun(subject).

Short ImperfectiveThe cases in (9) involve either a Future particle or a particular type of

be used clause-initially with its usual subject pronominal inflections. However,
the short imperfective is related to the positive imperative (which has no
morphological connection to the prohibitive). The positive imperative is
clause-initial (hence is preceded by no ""X"" element), and it lacks the usual
subject pronominals.","[30, 31]"

For R (which however prefers waer ... e) I have also heard a variant Neg +

hardly worthy of hyphenation. An example is a m m a r i-saw 'he will not

The Diebok dialect near Gao was not investigated in detail, but the two

Gao. It appears that - s a - is a Future element fused with Neg waer, much as
- m a r - is for T-ka. In (649.b), it appears that - s a - is reduced to -s- before a
V-initial verb, but the overall allomorphy and its morphosyntactic distribution
are not clear to me.

French verbs are not borrowed as inflectable verbs. Instead, the borrowed verb
stem is accompanied by the verb -vju- 'do' functioning as an auxiliary. The
borrowed stem generally ends in e, which can be taken as a composite of the
productive French infinitive -er, participial -e, ""vous"" form -ez, and perhaps
the imperfective (-ait, etc.). The borrowed verb functions as direct object of
-vju-. If the sense calls for a real object, this appears as a dative (650.a).

Clitics10.1 Sentential clitics
Clitics are normally realized at the end of the first word (perhaps a preverbal
particle or a verb) in the relevant clause (for occasional repetition of a
directional clitic on a noninitial word, see below). The clause onset for this
purpose excludes the following: a) topicalized NP or adverb (preverbal); b)
focalized NP or adverb; and c) the head noun in a definite relative (the
following demonstrative functions as clause-initial). Certain sentence-initial
particles like musam 'but' are also disregarded. When a preverbal particle
hosts a directional clitic, this clitic is optionally repeated on the following verb
as in (655) and (662) below, but other clitics are not doubled in this way.
Clitics include directionals (§10.2), object and dative pronominals (§10.3),
pronominal PPs, and (in extraction constructions) cliticized prepositions. For
details on the relative ordering of clitics, see §10.4.
The double symbol -\ is used to indicate the boundary between a clitic and
a preceding stem, suffix, or clitic. I use this since it can be typed within the
phonetic font used here and in the dictionary.","[612, 613, 614]"

2Sg and 3MaPl subject, are those predicted from Rightward Accent Shift. This
rule does not apply to (134.b) because of its audible subject prefix, but does
apply to (134.c-d) because they have no audible subject prefix (either because
there is no prefix, or because a t- prefix for 3FeSg or 2nd person has been
deleted before a C). However, the verb in (134.a) has no accent at all,
resulting in phrasal accent on the demonstrative.
The verb in (134.a) is 0-tastt, from /t-tattA/ before χ-pcl Erasure and the
other rules apply. When the 3FeSg prefix /t-/ is deleted (as usual in verbal
morphology before a C-initial stem), resulting in a (surface) unprefixed verb,
we might have expected Rightward Accent Shift to apply, shifting the accent
onto the stem-final /A/. Indeed, there is no prohibition on shifting the accent to
a word-final V (135).
