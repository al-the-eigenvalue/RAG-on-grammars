"4799.3Basic clause structureThe ‘clause’ is defined here as the minimal unit of syntactic organization
that includes a verbal element, finite or non-finite. Thus it encompasses the
‘verb phrase’ (predicate and any modifiers) and any ‘noun phrases’ (nouns
and any modifiers) needed to fill the predicate’s argument slots. The notion
of ‘verb phrase’ per se will not be dealt with further since the ‘clause’
includes the verb phrase by definition. Having discussed noun phrases in the
last section, this one takes up the topic of basic Ik clauses: unmarked main
clauses, subordinate clauses, and various types of marked main clauses.
Other specific topics covered in later sections of this chapter include
questions, reported speech, comparative constructions, and negation.
Ik exhibits a strict VSO constituent order in basic unmarked main clauses.
This puts it in a ‘word-order’ typological category with Ancient Egyptian, a
few Chadic languages, much of Eastern Sudanic (notably Eastern Nilotic),
and possibly some Berber and other Afroasiatic languages (Creissels
2000:252). It distinguishes it from other regional languages like Dhaasanac
(SOV) and Dime (SOV). Though Teso-Turkana languages are classified as
VSO, a VOS order is also common (Dimmendaal 1983:68). But VOS is not
attested in Ik. Like some of the controversially analyzed VSO languages in
Africa, Ik exhibits both VSO and SVO constituent orders. However, in Ik,
SVO is restricted to subordinate clauses, which are described below in §9.4.
Ik’s VSO constituent order along with its total lack of synchronically
functional prefixes is one of its ‘remarkable’ typological properties (Heine &
König 1996:123). This property, along with the subordinate clause SVO
contituent order, suggests that VSO may be a wholesale syntactic structure
replicated from the historically influential Eastern Nilotic languages.
A ‘basic clause’ is defined here is a simple, declarative statement with a 3SG
subject, realis modality, and positive polarity—in other words, functionally
and semantically unmarked. As noted above, the order of core constituents480in an Ik basic clause is VSO, or more precisely, VS in intransitive clauses and
VAO in transitive clauses. In (30) below, the noun ŋókᵃ ‘dog’ is functioning
as the subject of the intransitive predicate ep- ‘sleep’. And in (31), the same
noun is acting as the subject of the transitive predicate átsʼ- ‘gnaw’ with ɔká‘bone’ as its object. Note how the subject follows the verb in each example,
and how the object follows the subject in (31):
(30)Epa ŋok.
ep-aVŋók-ᵃSIntransitive=VSsleep-REAL dog-NOM
The dog is asleep.
(31)Atsʼa ŋoka oka.
átsʼ-áVŋók-áA ɔká-kᵃOTransitive=VAOgnaw-REAL dog-NOM bone-ACC
The dog gnaws a bone.
Tense clitics fall between the main verb and its first overt argument, as in:
(32)Epa bee ŋok.
ep-áV=beeŋók-ᵃ Ssleep-REAL=PST2dog-NOMThe dog slept (yesterday).
(33)Atsʼa noo ŋoka oka.
átsʼ-áV=nooŋók-áAɔká-kᵃOgnaw-REAL=PST 3dog-NOMbone-ACCThe dog gnawed the bone (a while ago).
When peripheral arguments and other adjuncts like adverbs are put in a
clause, these fall after any core constituents. For example, if the peripheral
argument kurú ‘in the shade’ is added to (32) from above, it comes after
both the verb and the subject, as in (34) below:481(34)Epa ŋoka kuru.
ep-aVŋók-áSkurú-∅PERIPHERALsleep-REAL dog-NOMshade-ABLThe dog is sleeping in the shade.
And if an adverb like hɪ́ɪ́ʝᵓ ‘slowly’ is added to (33), it comes after the verb,
tense clitic, subject, and object, as in:
(35)Atsʼa naa ŋoka okaa hiiʝ.
átsʼ-áV=naaŋók-áAɔká-áOhɪ ́ɪ ́ʝᵓADJUNCTgnaw-REAL=PST 1dog-NOMbone-ACCslowlyThe dog gnawed the bone slowly (earlier today).
If the arguments, core or peripheral, have modifiers, these modifiers directly
follow the NP heads they modify. The next three examples are variations of
(34), showing where respective NP modifiers occur:
(36)Epa ŋoka ncie kuru.
ep-aV[ŋók-ásleep-REAL dog-NOMɲci-e]S kurú-∅PERIPHERAL

(37)Epa ŋoka na ɓetsʼa kuru.

(38)Epa ŋoka kuruo na kwats.

"274Even if a 3SG subject is not cross-referenced—or is so with zero marking—
constituent order would tell a speaker what the subject and object were:
(128)Cea ama idemek.
cɛ-aám-áídeme-kᵃkill-REALperson- NOMsnake- ACCA person kills a snake.
(129)**Cea idemea am.
**cɛ-aídeme-a**kill-REAL snake- ACCám-∅
person-NOM**A person kills a snake.
These two sentences illustrates that even with accusative marking, the order
of subject and object cannot be reversed. At least synchronically, constituent
order is fixed enough to prevent any hypothetical ambiguity arising from
case ‘defectiveness’. So the split-accusativity of Ik cannot be based only on a
need to make up for a failure in subject cross-referencing on the verb.
Taking a different tack, some African languages show a special sensitivity to
the notion of ‘speech-act participant’. For example, in Turkana, the marking
of a direct or indirect object on a verb depends on whether it is a speech-act
participant. If it is (1/2 person), it is marked with the verbal prefix k-. If not
(3 person), no prefix is present (Dimmendaal 1983:124). Inversely, but with
the same attention to speech-act participants, the Ik accusative suffix is only
present if the clause’s subject is not a speech-act participant (i.e. 3 person).
Related to this is the idea of ‘prototypical transitivity’. According to Næss
(2007, quoted in Dimmendaal 2010:39), the prototypical Agent has the
semantic features [+volitional], [+instigating], and [-affected]. The
converse of this is that theprototypical Patient[-instigating],Dimmendaaland[+affected].","[305, 306]"
"4939.7Subordinate clause structureSubordinate (dependent) clause structure differs from that of unmarked
main clauses. How it differs depends on the type of clause involved.
Conditional and hypothetical subordinate clauses contain sequential verbs
that, by definition, must follow in sequence from a preceding verb (see
§10.2). This condition is satisfied in subordinate clauses by the
subordinating conjunction being placed in the clause-initial verbal slot,
followed by a subject in the nominative case, followed by the sequential
verb which is actually the main verb of the subordinate clause.
In (75), the conjunction nɑ= ‘if’ fills the syntactic verbal slot (V), while cɛɪɔ,
the clause’s real verb, is ‘co’-subordinate to it (V2). In this way, sequential
subordinate clauses attempt to preserve surface-level VSO order, although
there is a mismatch between deep and surface structure. This analysis tries
to account for why an otherwise preverbal subject is in the nominative case,
when all other preverbal subjects in the language take accusative case:
(75)Na soreima ceyoo poposaa...
[na=]Vsoré-ím-aAcɛ-ɪ-ɔV2pɔpɔsa-áOCONJ =boy-child-NOMkill-3SG-SEQ lizard-ACCIf a boy kills a lizard,...
Apart from ones with sequential verbs like in (75), all other subordinate
clauses in Ik have an SVO consituent order—SV for intransitive and AVO for
transitive. This SVO order recalls the Surmic language Tennet which also
has a VSO order in main clauses but SV in intransitive subordinate clauses
(Dimmendaal 2010:33). And like in Dhaasanac (Tosco 2001:14) and TesoTurkana languages, many subordinate clauses in Ik have the structure of a
relative clause, with the subordinating conjunction being based on relative
pronouns. For example, in the next two sentences, the conjunction noo
introducing them is identical to the remote past relative pronoun. Note the
respective constituent orders in these two temporal dependent clauses:494(76)Noo ŋokia epad,...
[nooŋókí-aSep-á=dᵉV]TEMP…","[524, 525, 526]"
"9.5.1 Auxiliary verbs proper
The auxiliary verbs ‘proper’ are lexical verbs in their own right but also
double as aspectual auxiliaries. In the Ik auxiliary verb construction, the
aspectual auxiliary fills the slot for the main verb and is the only verb
marked for subject-agreement, tense, and polarity. The semantic main verb
follows in a morphologically defective form. If the clause subject is overt, it
comes between the auxiliary and the main verb, making the constituent
order of auxiliarized clauses Aux-S-V or Aux-A-V-O, the same order found in485subordinate clauses. The only inflection found on the main verb in an
auxiliary construction is the realis suffix {-a}. It remains thus, regardless of
the various inflectional suffixes the auxiliary verb may take.
The verbs in (48) form a subset based on the fact that they all aspectually
modifyamorphologicallydefective,semanticallymainverb.","[516, 517]"

Complement clauses (§9.13.1), though subordinate themselves, make
another exception to the SVO order. Since they are embedded main clauses,
they retain the VSO constituent order of non-embedded main clauses. Such
clauses are introduced by the complementizer toimɛna/toimɛnɪ- ‘that’, which,
since it is a noun and argument of the matrix clause, takes case suffixes:
(78)Hyeiyaa toimena epa ŋok.
ɦye-í-átoimɛn-a[ep-aVŋók-ᵃS ]COMPLknow-1SG-REAL COMPL-NOM sleep-REAL dog-NOM
I know that the dog is sleeping.

bone-ACCI know that the dog is gnawing the bone.
Another defining property of Ik subordinate clauses is that all core
arguments (A/S/O) are marked with the accusative case. Again, this is
similar to Tennet, where main clauses have a nominative-accusative casemarking system, while in dependent clauses, this switches to ergativeabsolutive (Dimmendaal 2010:33). Also in this connection, the Saharan
language Tubu, which has Differential Object Marking, an object is more
likely to be marked accusative if not expressed in its normal position (König4952008:40, cited in Dimmendaal 2010:32). In other words, accusative case is
reserved for pragmatically marked positions. So in Ik, the accusative
marking on subjects (A/S) may have something to do with the subject being
in a pragmatically marked slot, that is, before the verb. The next two
examples illustrate this with intransitive (80) and transitive (81) clauses:
(80)Noo ncia epiaade kuru,...
[nooɲ́ci-aSep-í-á=deVkurú-∅]TEMPCONJ.PST3I-ACCsleep-1SG-REAL=DP shade-ABLWhen I slept in the shade,…

[nóóɲ́ci-aAátsʼ-ɪ ́-a=deVemé-kᵃO]TEMPCONJ.PST3I-ACCgnaw-1SG-REAL=DP meat-ACCWhen I gnawed on the meat,…
The type of case-marking neutralization exhibited in (80)-(81) violates
König’s typological prediction #7 for African languages with case: “If the
language is verb-initial or verb-medial, then the ‘no case before the verb’
rule applies” (2008:281). The Surmic language Tennet, spoken not far from
Ik in South Sudan, also violates this prediction, but only partially. But as
hinted at above, normal case marking is retained in Ik subordinate clauses
with sequential aspect verb forms. Note that in the following example, all
core arguments bear the nominative case suffix (including the object):
(82)Na nka atsʼia ema,...
[na=ŋk-aAátsʼ-ɪ-aVem-aO]CONDCONJ =I-NOMgnaw-1SG-SEQmeat-NOMIf I gnaw on meat,…","[526, 527]"
"9.8.3 Relative clause structure
Relative clauses in Ik always immediately follow the CA in the main clause,
regardless of constituents before the main clause or after the relative clause.
Normally, the order of constituents in a main clause is VS or VAO, but when
the CA is the subject of the main clause, it can be fronted and then followed
by the relative clause and the main verb, making the constituent order SV or
AVO. This can be seen in (92) above as well as in the following:502(98)Ama na cea basaurek, isokuk.
[ám-á=[nacɛ-abasaúré-kᵃ]RC ‖ isók-ú-kᵒ]MCperson-NOM=REL.SGkill-REAL eland-ACCgo.early-3SG-SEQThe person who kills an eland goes early (i.e. before others).
The sentence in (98) is a version of (99) below in which the subject has
been put into special focus for pragmatic or stylistic reasons. (99) represents
the unmarked constituent order for the same proposition.
(99)Isokuo ama na cea basaurek.
isók-ú-oám-á =[nacɛ-abasaúré-kᵃ]go.early-3SG-SEQperson- NOM=REL.SGkill-REALeland-ACCThe person who kills an eland goes early.
The constituent order within the relative clauses themselves also departs
from that of unmarked main clauses. After the relative pronoun, then comes
the subject (if mentioned) and the verb followed by any other overtly
mentioned core arguments, peripheral arguments, adverbs, etc., making the
RC constituent orders as follows: (rel)(S)V for intransitive clauses and
(rel)(A)V(O) for transitive clauses.
Core arguments (A/S/O) can only be overt in an RC if they are not the CA
of the whole RC construction. For example, in (100), the CA tuka- ‘feather’
is recapitulated in the RC as ntsí- ‘it’, resulting in an ungrammaticality:
(100)**Ŋabiya noo tukaa na ntsia buɗam.
**[ŋáb-i-a=nootuka-a=[nantsí-á buɗám-∅]RC ]MC**wear-PLUR-REAL=PST3 feather-ACC=REL.SG it-ACC black-REAL
**He used to wear a black feather (lit. ‘a feather which it is black’).
Likewise, in (101), the CA ínó- ‘animals’ is recapitulated in the RC as ńtí‘they’ with the resulting structure being ungrammatical:503(101)**Inoa ni Icea ƙaƙiya ntik.
**ínó-a=[niicé-áƙaƙ-i-ańtí-kᵃ]RC**animals-NOM=REL.PL Ik-ACC hunt-PLUR- REAL they-ACC
**The animals that the Ik hunt them.
Ik relative pronouns are omissable but only in the non-past. In the three past
tenses, they are retained because they encode the tense of the RC. This is
similar to Turkana where the full form of relative markers are used only in
past tenses, a truncated form being used in the non-past (Dimmendaal
1983:308). Further conditions for the omission of Ik relative pronouns
include: 1) When the CA in the MC is a demonstrative pronoun (§5.5), 2)
when the CA in the MC is the head of a verbless clause, or 3) when the CA
in the MC is followed by an anaphoric pronoun. In (102), an RC modifies
the demonstrative pronoun ɗa; note the absence of a relative pronoun:
(101)Tabiduo ɗa taba tasapetik.
táb-idu-oɗ-a[táb-atasapetí-kᵃ]RCtouch-2SG- SEQone-NOMtouch- REAL initiation-ACCAnd (you) touch upon those (i.e. stories) that are about initiation.
In the next example, the MC is a verbless clause whose head is a noun
marked with the copulative case. This noun is functioning as the CA. Here
again, no relative pronoun is present:
(102)Ntsuo atsimee awak.
ntsú-ó [ats-ím-é=e
it-COPawá-kᵉ]RCcome-1PL.EXC-REAL=DP home-DATIt’s (the hour) (when) we come home.
In this third and final example, the singular anaphoric pronoun =ꜜdéé
comes between the CA and the RC, with no intervening relative pronoun:504(103)ama dee bara
ám-á=ꜜdéé[bar-a]RCperson-NOM=ANPH.SGrich-REALthat rich person (lit. ‘that person (who is) rich’)
The number of verb-form types allowed in an Ik relative clause is restricted.
For positive polarity, only realis forms are allowed. For negative polarity,
only irrealis forms are allowed. Other forms, like sequential, simultaneous,
and optative, cannot function as the predicate of a relative clause.
Relative causes can be negated. To negate one, the sequential negator moo
(and allomorph noo) is used just after the relative pronoun. If the subject of
the relative clause is overt, then it follows the negator. Being negated, the
main verb of the RC then appears in its negative (irrealis) form, as in:
(104)jejeika dii nuu moo epanid
jéje-ik-a=ꜜdíí=[nu-umo-oep-anɪ ́=dᵋ]RCskins-PL-NOM=ANPH.PL=REL.PL not-SEQ sleep-IPS=DP

"272It does not delete the final vowel of the stem but instead attaches directly to
it. Before a pause, the vowel of the suffix devoices, changing the suffix to
/-kᵃ/ or /-k̚/. And within a phrase, the suffix loses the /k/, changing the
suffix simply to /-a/. If the stem-final vowel is a high back vowel, it may
desyllabify and cause the accusative suffix to lengthen in compensation:

core clausal arguments, namely the following:

third person subjects. If the subject of the clause is first or second person,
then both the subject and the object(s) take the nominative case (§6.3.1).
See, for example, the pattern in the following paradigm, in which the
accusative case (underlined) is found only with the third person verb forms:273(125)Number-based differential accusative marking

marking the object (O) of transitive clauses with 3SG/PL person subjects:

As noted in the Case Overview (§6.1), Ik is classified as a split-accusative
language due to this type of number-based differential object marking.
While this is the descriptive fact, can any explanation be offered for it?
Some attempts can be made, though none are conclusive. König suggests
that accusative marking comes into play when cross-referencing ‘fails’ on
the verb (2008:85). That is, if the subject is not cross-referenced on the
verb, case is needed to show grammatical relations. But this explanation
falls short on two accounts: 1) First, clausal constituent order is not flexible
enough to admit the kind of ambiguity implied by König’s analysis. 2) The
‘failure’ of cross-reference (i.e. a zero morpheme) is in itself cross-reference.","[303, 304, 305]"
"9.11.1 Cleft construction
Ik cleft constructions consist of a clefted clausal argument in the copulative
case followed by the original main clause now in a subordinated form. As
indicated by the copulative case marking, the Ik cleft construction takes the
form of a verbless copula clause (§9.10.1) in which the copula complement
(CC) is the clefted argument and the copula subject (CS) is the original, now
subordinate main clause. It can be formulated as follows:
(150)Ik cleft construction:[NP-COP]CC [SUBORD]CSThe following pair of sentences exemplify the Ik cleft construction. The first
example is a pragmatically unmarked basic clause with the canonical word

original main verb, bɛ́ɗɪ́m, then assumes its role as the predicate in a
subordinate clause acting as the subject of the verbless clause mɛsɔɔ:

"2326.1Case overview
“The case marking typology of a language is surely its most central
typological parameter, since almost all other parts of the grammar
must interact with it.”—Talmy Givón, quoted by Serzisko (1992:50)All Ik nominals must be inflected for case, and formal parallels of nominal
case markers are found in other diverse parts of the grammar. Due to its
grammatical centrality, the Ik case system has already been the subject of
several works (e.g. Heine 1990, König 2002, König 2008, and Schrock
2014). As König defines it, “a case system is an inflexional system of
marking nouns or noun phrases for the type of relationship they bear to
their heads… expressed by affixes, tone, accent shift, or root reduction…”
(2008:5). Out of the above list, Ik uses a combination of affixes and stem
reduction to encode case relations. The affixes are suffixes, and stem
reduction means the stem-final vowel is deleted before some case suffixes.
Ik employs eight cases to encode grammatical relations between verbs and
their arguments, or between arguments and modifiers (genitive). In König’s
African case typology, Ik is a Type 2 split-accusative system in which both the
nominative and accusative cases are marked (2008:10). It is ‘accusative’ in
that when core clausal arguments are marked differently from each other, S
and A take the nominative case, while O takes the accusative case. And it is
‘split’ in that this accusativity only occurs when the subject (A) is third
person. The objects (O) of first and second person subjects (A/S) take the
nominative case. And when a subject (A/S) is preposed before the verb, for
example in most types of subordinate clauses, it also takes the accusative.
(2)1/2 person subjects3 person subjectsAAO
SNOMO
SNOMACC233Blake defines case as a typical system of “marking the relationship of a noun
to a verb at the clause level or of a noun to a preposition, postposition or
another noun at the phrase level” (1994:1). True to this definition, Ik case
encodes the grammatical relations between a verb and its core arguments
and any non-core arguments. And though in Ik the genitive case can mark
arguments for some verbs, its main function is to mark the relationship
between a noun phrase and a possessive nominal modifier.
A ‘core argument’ in Ik is generally defined as any verbal argument that
cannot be represented by the dummy pronoun (§5.10). Normally such
arguments are encoded with the nominative, accusative, or copulative cases,
but as explained below, various complications occur. And as its label
suggests, the ‘oblique’ case straddles the simple divide between ‘core’ and
‘non-core’ cases: It actually encodes all core arguments in imperative and
optative clauses, as well as a variety of peripheral argument roles in other
types of clauses, but it cannot be represented by the dummy pronoun. The
basic case-marking scheme for clausal arguments in Ik is presented in (3):
(3)Basic case-marking scheme on clausal arguments

bone-ACC234Subjects (A/S) of conditional/hypothetical subordinate clauses with a
sequential verb form are also marked with the nominative case. (This is
because the syntax is interpreting the conjunction na as filling the verbal
slot; indeed it can be followed by both tense and adverbial enclitics as any
typical verb would. For more on subordinate clause syntax, see §9.9):
(6)Na bia iryameiduo kaudzoe,…

you.SG-ACCIf you get thirsty,… (lit. ‘If the sun starts eating you,…)
But subjects (A/S) of all other types of subordinate clauses take the
accusative case. In such clauses, the constituent order is SV/AVO, a
deviation from the language’s unmarked VS/VAO order. For yet unknown
reasons, Ik syntax marks preverbal subjects (with the above exceptions of
sequential subordinate clauses) with the accusative case, as in:
(8)Noo ncia kwatsiyaad,…

(11)Goƙaaketano njinǃ
ɡoƙ-aak-ét-anoɲjínSseated-DISTR-INCH-OPTwe.INC[OBL]Let us be seatedǃ
The direct object (O) of a transitive clause in the indicative mood, with a
first or second person subject, also takes the nominative case:

"567The sequential impersonal passive (SPS; §7.9.4) is found in the same types of
discourse as the non-passive sequential forms. Like the impersonal passive
(§7.9.3), the SPS omits and depersonalizes the subject (A/S) of the verb to
which it affixes. It is found on both transitive and intransitive verbs, as in
ŋƙ-esᵉ ‘And it is/was eaten’ and ƙe-esᵉ ‘It is/was gone (i.e. ‘people went’)’.
The following excerpt from an expository/procedural text illustrates the use
of the suffix {-ɛsɛˊ} encoding sequential passivized activities. In this text,
part of the procedure for grinding snuff tobacco (a favorite among the Ik) is
laid out in a step-by-step sequence. The agent carrying out the procedure is
not in view, though all sequential verbs in this excerpt are transitive. In
lines 2, 4, 6 & 7, the objects of the passivized verbs are overt, encoded as
subjects in the nominative case. In line 5, they are left implicit:

As (17) shows, sequential clause chains can be interrupted and reinitiated
by adverbial clauses expressing simultaneity, marked by the conjunction
náá. Such clauses encode temporality relative to the sequential clauses that
follow them, not the absolute temporality set by the controlling clause.
On a continuum between coordination and subordination, sequential clauses
are more coordinative. This is reflected syntactically in their invariable VSO
constituent order and canonical case marking, both characteristics of
unmarked main clauses. The next examples—the first a non-past realis
clause and the second a sequential clause—both have VAO order with
nominative-marked subjects and accusative-marked objects:569(18)Ceesa ntsa riyek.","[598, 599, 600, 601]"
"116Downdrift (T1), or ‘automatic downstep’, describes the lowering of the pitch
register or ‘ceiling’ after an overt L tone. The result is that a H tone after a L
tone will be lower in pitch than preceding H tones. Ik downdrift must be
qualified in two ways: 1) In order to cause downdrift, the L tone must
surface as a low or low-falling pitch, not a mid pitch. This means that an L
surfacing as mid pitch cannot cause downdrift. So it is not any L, but a L
near a tone phrasal boundary that causes downdrift. And 2), a L tone does
not cause downdrift if no H tones precede it. This is by definition, since
‘downdrift’ implies lowering of successive Hs:

he-GENHe’s scratching his nose (pl. in Ik).
In (59), prosody and syntax align to define the relevant tonal phrase as
made up of a clause constituent: verb, object NP, genitive NP. Because of
this phrasal domain so defined, the realis suffix on the verb surfaces as low
pitch, causing downdrift on the following object NP. Then, after the L tones
on the subject NP (aƙátikaa) which surface with low pitch before the tone
phrase boundary, downdrift lowers the H tone on the genitive NP.

Likewise in (60), after each major clause constituent—verb, subject NP,

L tone. The head of the subject NP (ɔ́ʝá) does not cause downdrift in the
following genitive modifier because ɔ́ʝá has no L tone.","[147, 148]"
"6 Case
The description of Ik ‘case’ is placed here between nouns and verbs because
as a meta-categorial system, it applies to both these major word classes.
Case is the backbone of Ik grammar. It permeates nearly every grammatical
subsystem, such that a good grasp of it is key to knowing the language.
Thus, beyond giving an overview of the case system (§6.1), this chapter’s
aim is to lay out the details of case in the nominal system (§6.2-6.3) and
grammaticalized ‘case’ in other systems, particularly that of verbs (§6.4).
As far as case languages in Africa go, Ik is a magnificent specimen. The
following artificially elicited (but fully grammatical) sentence illustrates this
by making use of all eight morphological cases: Nominative1, Copulative2,
Accusative3, Ablative4, Dative5, Genitive6, Instrumental7, and Oblique8:(1)Benia ntsa amoo noo cea inwaa

A complex sentence like this one embodies the language’s full-fledged
morphological case-marking system. In addition to word order and
connectives like ńda ‘with’, Ik uses this case system to mark grammatical
relations and encode semantic roles in an integral and efficient manner.","[261, 262, 263]"
"571On a continuum between coordination and subordination, simultaneous
clauses fall closer to subordination. This is evident syntactically in that a)
they exhibit the SVO constituent order of other subordinate clauses and b)
any overt core arguments, regardless of the grammatical person and number
of the subject, take the accusative case as in other subordinate clauses. The
third line from (20) is repeated in (21) to illustrate these points. Note that
the constituent order is SV, and the overt subject, ikáá ‘head’ is both
preverbal and marked in the accusative case:
(21)...ikaa iyie kiʝee,
iká-áSi-i-eVkíʝé-ePERIPHERALhead-ACCbe-3SG- SIML ground-DAT...(his) head (being) down,
The subordinate nature of simultaneous chained clauses is also seen
discursively in that they take the sequence of events temporarily ‘offline’.
For example, in a narrative, they interrupt the mainline to provide
contextual details like the fact that the guy’s headed was hanging down,
upside-down. To get back to the mainline sequence, a pre-posed
simultaneous clause is often used. This occurs a few lines later in the story
of (20), after the man’s wife got worried and went to look for him:
(22)Na ƙayie, itayoo amee inenoosik.
[na=ƙa-i-e]ADVɪta-ɪ-ɔámé-e[inénó-ós-í-kᵉ]SIMLCONJ =go-3SG-SIMLreach-3SG-SEQperson-DAT hang-PASS-3SG-SIMLWhen she went, she found the guy hanging.
Lastly, chained simultaneous clauses may function in specific ways: as
adverbial manner clauses (§9.6.2), as one of the complementation strategies
(§9.11.2), and in bi-clausal comparative constructions (§9.13.2). These three
functions are reiterated here with one example each. In (23), the
simultaneous clause relates the manner in which a fire climbed up a hill:572(23)Toriteta naa tsʼaɗ,
totir-et-a=náatsʼaɗ-ᵃclimb-VEN-REAL=PST1fire-NOMThe fire climbed up

[ŋƙ-ɪ-ɛdakw-itíní-iciká-amuɲ]SIMLeat-COMP-3SG-SIMLtree-PL-VAR.PL-ACCallconsuming all the various types of trees.
In this second example, the chained simultaneous clause acts as a
complement to the main verb ɪtámáán- ‘behoove/necessitate’:
(24)Itamaana
ɪtámáán-a
necessitate-REAL
It is necessary (that)

And in this last example, the chained simultaneous clause acts as an
adverbial manner clause in a bi-clausal comparative construction:
(25)Kwatsa ntsa iloyee ncik.
kwáts-ánts-a[ɪlɔ́-ɪ ́-ɛ́ɲ́ci-kᵃ]SIMLsmall-REAL he-NOM defeat-3SG-SIML I-ACC
He’s smaller than me.","[602, 603, 604]"
"But there are also instances where the syntax of subordinate clauses
rearranges the usual order of clausal constituents. Temporal subordinate
clauses in Ik have the form of a relative clause (§9.9.1), and Ik time
expressions are often encoded in the instrumental case (i.e. as a non-core
argument). These two factors combined mean that a temporal subordinate
clause without an overt time word marks its verb with the DP. This is
because the syntax is interpreting the temporal conjunction as a relative
pronoun whose common argument is peripheral argument that in fact does
not exist. So in the following two examples, the DP is present on the verb to
show that the missing argument—a time expression—is accounted for:
(66)Noo kwatsiad,...
nookwáts-í-á=dᵉCONJ.PST3small-1SG-REAL=DPWhen I was small,…
(67)Sina iyanee Kamionok,...
sɪ-nai-an-é=ekámíóno-kᵉCONJ.PST2be-IPS-REAL=DP Kamion-DATWhen people were in Kamion yesterday,…
Likewise, if the common argument (CA) or head of a normal relative clause
is a peripheral argument in the relative clause, then the dummy pronoun229must be attached to the verb. This is because the relative pronoun
representing the CA of the relative clause comes before the verb in Ik,
meaning it has been fronted from what would be its normal position after
the verb. This fulfills the requirements for the use of the dummy pronoun:
(68)Ɗuo nuu didia watad.
ɗu-ó=nuudidi-aPRO. PL- COP=REL.PL.PST 3 weather-ACCwat-á=dᵉ
rain-REAL=DPIt’s the ones (i.e. reasons) which it rained for.
‘That’s why it rained.’

Those it was missing from,
ma-íó=ꜜdeemuti=ꜜdéégive-IMP.PL=DP story[OBL]=ANPH.SG
give them that storyǃ
In (68), the CA of the main clause (a copular cleft construction) and the
relative clause is the cause or reason for rain. Since it is left-dislocated out
of the relative clause, it is marked with the DP. In (69), the CA of main and
relative clauses is a time expression. In (70), the DP is used twice: 1) First, it
marks the source object of the verb bɪraa ‘it lacks’ that has been fronted
(things lack from in Ik), and 2) second, it marks the recipient object of the
imperative verb maíó ‘give (pl.)’ that is in the previous clause (ɗɑ=nuu).","[260, 261]"
"9.8.2 Relative pronouns
Relative clauses in Ik can be recognized by three criteria: 1) the intonation
contour in which the MC and RC are treated as one sentence prosodically,
2) the presence of relative pronouns at the beginning of the RC, and 3) the
non-canonical constituent order within the RC. The particles introducing
relative clauses are treated here as relative ‘pronouns’ instead of ‘markers’
since they are not invariable and do communicate some information,
namely the grammatical number of the common argument and the tense of
the relative clause. These Ik relative pronouns are already discussed in §5.6
but warrant further mention here as well. The table below presents the
relative pronouns according to number and tense:
(95)Ik relative pronouns
SingularPluralNON-PAST=na=niPST1=náa=níiPST2=sɪna=siniPST3=nɔɔ=nuuThe relative pronouns are analyzed as enclitics because they form a
phonological word with the preceding noun (evidenced by the post-lexical
vowel harmony they participate in). And based on the forms in (95), it is
evident that the Ik relative pronouns are closely related to the temporal501nominal demonstratives (see §8.2.2). Quite so, they are identical in form,
the only difference being that since relative pronouns never appear clausefinally, they consequently do not have final forms. Like the demonstratives
they originate from, the relative pronouns communicate number and tense.
For example, in (96) below, the relative pronoun =na conveys two bits of
information about the RC construction’s common argument ŋƙáƙá- ‘food’: 1)
It is viewed as singular, and 2) the state predicated of it in the RC is in the
present time or in general (gnomic). Likewise, in (97), the relative pronoun
=nuu communicates about the CA roɓa- that 1) it is plural, and 2) the
action predicated of it took place in the remote past:
(96)Mita daŋa nƙaƙa Icee ne efa zuk.

"129[ƙaátanaamuɲu]The third intonational pattern, called the solicitive tune, is used to solicit
agreement from the hearer. It is often heard in the following contexts: 1)
making polite requests or gentle commands, 2) making statements subject to
the hearer’s approval, and 3) ensuring the hearer’s attention. The solicitive
tune can apply to both main clauses and subordinate clauses (even ones
preceding the main clauses of declarative statements or questions.)
The solicitive tune is marked by a low-rising (LH) boundary tone. Unlike the
indicative and interrogative tunes, the final morpheme of a clause can
appear in either its non-final or final form. When the final form occurs,
vowels normally devoiced surface as voiced so as to link to the low-rising
tone to a tone-bearing unit. But because a) the LH boundary tone applies
only to the clauses’s final vowel and b) contour tones in Ik must link to two
phonological TBUs, the final vowel is doubled for the solicitive tune:
(83)Jʼeʝa naa aweee?
ʝɛʝ-a=nááawé-eéstay-REAL=PST1home-DATS/he stayed at home, (okay)?(awá-keé)130[ʝɛʝanááawéeé]Just as (83) shows the solicitive tune operating on a high-toned morpheme,
(84) shows the same tune applying to the low-toned muɲu ‘all’:
(84)Ƙaata na muɲuu?
ƙa-át-a=naamuɲuúgo-3PL-REAL=PST 1 all
They all went, (okay)?
[ƙaátanaamuɲuú]4 Nouns
As one of language’s ‘evolutionary primitives’ (Heine & Kuteva 2007:59),
nouns comprise one of Ik’s two large open word classes (the other being
verbs). The present chapter begins with an overview of noun roots (§4.1)
moving on then to nominal suffixes (§4.2), compounds (§4.3), and several
types of onomastics (§4.4.-§4.5). Case marking, a crucial feature of the
nominal system, is treated in Chapter 6 on the way to the wider grammar.
In Ik, a noun is any word whose primary function is to be the head of a
noun phrase, which in turn functions as an argument of a verb. As the head
of a noun phrase, a noun must be inflected for case to show its relation to
other words. It may also take other nominal suffixes and may be joined to
another noun or pronoun in a compound construction. A second function of
an Ik noun is to be the head of the predicate. To fulfil this function, a noun
must take the copulative case marker (§6.3.8), which is the functional
equivalent of a copula and allows the noun to stand alone as a sentence.
Semantically, the prototypical Ik noun refers to inanimate and animate
objects, people, and places—anything in the world that is viewed as an
inherent non-event. However, the boundary between things named by
nouns and events named by verbs is fuzzy. Many lexical event concepts can
become nouns with noun morphology or verbs with verb morphology, e.g.:
(1)Lexemes ambiguously nominal or verbal
botá-‘migrate’ƙɔ́ɗɛ́-‘cry’cooka-‘shepherd’ɔfa-‘cough’deƙu-‘quarrel’sáɡo-‘snare’ɗɔanɪ ́-‘weed’sʊpa-‘breathe’epú-‘sleep’taatsa-‘pay’féí-‘bathe’taʝala-‘give up’132fekí-‘laugh’tɔkɔba-‘farm’ɪ ̯ana-‘talk’tɔkɔra-‘distribute’ɪƙɪra-‘write’tɔlɔka-‘trap’ɪrɛʝa-‘slash grass’tɛwɛa-‘broadcast seed’iruɓa-‘chew hard foods’tóda-‘speak’isira-‘decorate’tsuwaa-‘run’ɪtsɪka-‘order’wáána-‘pray’ɪwara-‘plaster’waté-‘rain’ƙaƙa-‘hunt’zɛƙɔ́-‘sit/stay’Ik nominal morphology is minimal—four being the maximum number of
morphemes a single noun can have (outside of compounds). Compare this to
Turkana nouns which may have up to eleven morphemes (Dimmendaal
1983:208)ǃ Any Ik noun in a post-lexical grammatical context consists
minimally of a lexical root plus a case marker. Besides the case marker, the
only other nominal suffixes are number and possession markers. The order
in which these occur is ROOT-(NUMBER)-(POSSESSION)- CASE. Unlike Turkana
and Dhaasanac, Ik has no grammatical gender marked on nouns. Ik
compensates for its minimal noun inflection by joining nouns and pronouns
together in a variety of compounds. Thus, meanings expressed by affixes in
other languages are expressed by a compound construction in Ik.
In their basic underlying forms, every Ik nominal root and suffix ends in a
vowel, without exception. This final vowel is unpredictable since it can be
any of the language’s nine contrastive vowels. Because of this, these final
vowels are treated universally as part of the root in Ik. Similar ‘terminal
vowels’ in the East Cushitic Dhaasanac are only viewed as part of the stem
in some cases where they “are by and large meaningless elements…[maybe]
ancient desemanticized gender markers” (Tosco 2001:65). And like the
Omotic language Dime (Mulugeta 2008), Ik has some nouns whose rootfinal vowel has two free variants, e.g. kɔlá~kɔlɛ́- ‘goat’ and zɪná~zɪnɔ́‘zebra’. Such cases seem to arise along the lines of chronolects and idiolects.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"
"9.1Noun phrase structureNoun phrases (NP) fill core or peripheral argument slots in clause structure.
Their phrasal heads can be made up of a solitary noun (including
nominalized verbs), pronoun, or compound. Noun phrases may also include
one or more modifiers such as: demonstratives, quantifiers, possessive
phrases, or relative clauses. In other words, a given NP may consist of just
the head or of multiple embedded phrases and/or clauses.
Any modifiers within an Ik noun phrase follow the phrasal head they
modify. This conforms to expectations for VSO languages (Creissels
2000:252), of which Ik is one. For example, in (1) below, the possessive NP
ɲ́ ci ‘my’ follows the noun dakwitíná ‘trees’, as do the plural demonstrative
=ni in (2) and the numeral quantifier aɗᵉ ‘three’ in (3):
(1)dakwitina nci
[dakw-itín-á[ɲ́ci-∅]NP:POSS ]NPtree-PL-NOMI-GENmy trees472(2)dakwitina ni
[dakw-itín-á=ni]NP
tree-PL-NOM=DEM.PL
these trees(3)dakwitina aɗ
[dakw-itín-áaɗᵉ]NPtree-PL-NOMthreethree trees
More than one type of demonstrative may modify a noun in the same noun
phrase. When all three types of demonstrative cooccur, they do so in the
following order: anaphoric-temporal-spatial. An example of this is in (4):
(4)ama dee sina ne
[ám-á=ꜜdéé=sɪna=ne]NP
person-NOM=ANPH.SG=PST2.DEM.SG=DEM.SG.MED
that person there (of yesterday, already mentioned)Ik speakers have a penchant for using spatial demonstratives more than
once in a single noun phrase (see also §8.2.1). It seems to add a bit of
rhythmic balance to one’s speech. (5) shows an example of this:
(5)ama ke naa ke
[ám-á=ke=náa=ke]NP
person-NOM=DEM.SG.DIST=DEM.SG.PST1=DEM.SG.DIST
that person over there (of earlier today)If a modifier NP is selecting its head from a group rather than merely
qualifying it, it trades places: It becomes the NP head and the modified
noun becomes a possessive NP. This happens, for example, with the
indefinite pronoun saí- ‘some more, some other’ and the interrogative
pronominal compound ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ́- ‘which?’. In (6), the noun awika- ‘homes’ is473bumped into an embedded genitive possessive phrase modifying the
indefinite saa. And in (7), the same thing happens to awáᵉ ‘home’:
(6)saa awikae
[sa-a[aw-ika-ᵉ]NP:POSS ]NPother- NOM home-PL-GEN
some other homes
(7)Nteena awae?
[ńtɛ́-ɛ́n-á[awá-ᵉ]NP:POSS ]NPwhich-PSSM-NOMhome-GENWhich home?
If a quantifier cooccurs with either a possessive phrase or a demonstrative in
an NP, the quantifer comes last in the sequence, for example:
(8)ŋokitina ncie gai
[ŋók-ítín-á [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSSꜜɡáí]NPdog-PL-NOM I-GENbothboth my dogs
(9)ŋokitina ni gai
[ŋók-ítín-á=niꜜɡáí]NPdog-PL-NOM DEM.PL both
both these dogs
And if all three types of modifers are present, the following order obtains:
(10)ŋokitina ncie ni gai ni
[ŋók-ítín-á [ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS=niꜜɡáí =(ni)]NPdog-PL-NOM I-GEN=DEM.PLboth=DEM.PLboth these dogs of mine (these)474Noun phrase heads may be modified by relative clauses (see §9.8 for a more
detailed treatment). These clauses also follow the NP head. They tend to fall
at the end of the NP, but quantifiers may optionally follow them:
(11)dakwitina ncie gai ni dunaaket
[dakw-itín-á[ɲ́ci-e]NP:POSS ꜜɡáí=[nidun-aak-et-ᵃˊ]RC]NPtree-PL-NOMI-GENold-DISTR-INCH-REALboth=REL.PLboth of my old trees

And when multiple adjectival verbs are used to describe a clausal argument,
only one relative clause structure is used. After the relative pronoun come
the two or more adjectivals, demarcated with a pause (‖) between each one:
(13)dakwitina ncie ni dunaaket,

constructions within in noun phrases, but also some of the broader issues
surrounding how ‘possession’ is syntactically encoded in the language.","[503, 504, 505, 506]"
"439By contrast, in (32), the anaphoric noun phrase emuta ꜜdéé ‘that story’ refers
back to two full clauses each introduced by naítá (and underlined), that are
both functioning as complements of the imperative verb tóde ‘tell’:

Lastly, Ik nominal demonstratives—spatial, temporal, and anaphoric—are
not mutually exclusive. They can occur singly or in combination with one or
two other types. This is possible because they all have different functions,
indicating the location, place in time, and discourse topicality, respectively,
of their referents. Whichever types coincide in one noun phrase, the order in
which they occur is: NP.HEAD=(anaphoric)=(spatial/temporal)=(spatial):440(33)Cooccuring nominal demonstratives

In addition to nominal demonstratives that point to objects, and anaphoric
demonstratives that point to known information, Ik also has several locative
adverbial demonstratives that point to a place. These also include deictics
and anaphorics. The deictics comprise a three-term system distinguishing
proximal, medial, and distal distances, just like nominal demonstratives. The
anaphoricsinclude twodemonstratives thatrefer toa placeormetaphorically to a time already known from the discourse context.
Even though they adverbially specify a location or direction, the Ik locative
adverbial demonstratives exhibit the structure and behavior of nouns. That
is, they can be inflected for all eight nominal cases and can be modified by
deictic demonstratives as well as relative clauses. When they are modified
by relative clauses, they fulfill the language’s need for locative adverbial
clauses. For example in (34), the locative demonstrative naí- acts as a
peripheral argument (encoding a Destination role) of the verb ƙa- ‘go’. It is
then modified by a relative clause (RC) introduced by the relative pronoun

"4.3.1 Formal properties
As a noun-building strategy, Ik compounding involves joining two or more
(pro)nominal elements together in an associative construction with special
formal and semantic characteristics. The formal characteristics include the172following: 1) a phonological word profile with inter-nominal vowel
harmony, 2) a tone melody applying over the whole compound rather than
its individual elements, 2) a reversed word order—modifier before head—
where head before modifier is the norm elsewhere, and 3) a unique case
marking whereby the first noun (N1) take the oblique case and the second
noun (N2) takes whatever case the syntax requires for the whole compound.
These formal features show that the construction cannot be called mere
‘juxtaposition’ as it has been in the literature (e.g. Heine & König 1996:35).
The first formal property of compounds to be discussed is vowel harmony. A
compound comprises a phonological word which, by definition, allows a
degree of vowel harmony (see §3.1.7). The domain of vowel harmony in Ik
compounds is across the boundary between N1 and N2. If the first segment of
N2 is the [+ATR] vowel /i/, then it can harmonize the last vowel (if CV-) or
the last two vowels (if CVV-) of the N1. This is a surface level condition and
so is not represented elsewhere in the grammar unless particularly relevant:

the compound as a whole takes on its own tone melody. Compound-induced
tone changes are an instance of melodic template completion: A compound’s
melody is determined by the tone melody of the N1 and the changes its
effects on the tone of the N2. Some of the different composite melodies that
arise in compounds are exemplified in the following tables.
First, when the N1 is a bisyllabic noun with a HH melody, any bisyllabic
nouns it takes as its N2 will have a LL melody, regardless of its input melody
(HH, LH, LL, etc.). This is evidence of a HH-LL tonal template:173(65)Compound tone melodies with a HH N1 melody

Moving on to compound structure: Compounds reverse the normal noun
phrase word order in which modifiers follow the heads they modify. In
compounds, the modifier appears as N1 followed by the head as the N2.","[203, 204, 205, 206]"
"171.2.2 Typology
The difficulty in classifying Ik genetically stems largely from its unique and
eclectic typological profile among other languages in East Africa. This
typological profile is summarized below and illustrated with an annotated
text. The goal of this section is to give the reader an overall impression of
the language—a sort of typological Gestalt―in case there is no time to read
through each chapter in detail. The overview begins with phonology and
then proceeds through morphology, syntax, and finally the annotated text.
In terms of phonology, Ik has thirty-nine (39) contrastive sounds: thirty (30)
consonants and nine (9) vowels. Consonants made with pulmonic airstream
include plosives, affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals, and glides. Those
made with glottalic airstream include implosives and ejectives. The three
lateral fricatives and ejectives Ik once used are now almost entirely lost.
Eight of the nine vowels consist of [+ATR]/[-ATR] pairs that operate in a
[+ATR]-dominant vowel harmony system. The low vowel /a/ is opaque but
can be lexically (morphologically) specified with either [ATR] value.
The rightward edge of an Ik phonological phrase is strictly observed. This
means that the final segment of any word or morpheme, whether consonant
or vowel, is reduced before a pause. In this reduction, consonants may be
partially devoiced and/or unreleased, while vowels are usually fully
devoiced or deleted. Devoiced consonants and vowels are allophonic, not
phonemic. Other allophonic changes observed among consonants include
nasal assimilation, place assimilation, implosivization, and debuccalization,
while other allophones among vowels arise from raising and glottalization.
At the juncture of morphemes, certain consonants may be deleted and vowel
may assimilate partially or totally to nearby vowels.
The template (C)V can generate all lawful phonological syllables in Ik, and
the concatenation of morphemes may require resyllabifications in the form
of vowel epenthesis, inter-consonantal syncope, vowel deletion, haplology,18desyllabification/compensatory lengthening, and metathesis. At the surface
level, the template (C)V(V)(C) generates all lawful phonetic syllables.
Ik is a tonal language with two underlying tone levels: H and L. Ik has
lexical tone though few tonal minimal pairs. There is no grammatical tone
in the sense of a morpheme made up solely of a tonal autosegment.
However, tone changes do accompany various segmental morphemes. Htone may surface phonetically as high, high-falling, or downstepped high
pitch. L-tone may surface as low, low-falling, or mid pitch. Voiced
obstruents function pervasively as depressor consonants, pulling the pitch of
a preceding high tone to high-falling, mid, or low pitch. Downdrift occurs,
as well as depressor-consonant induced downstep. All noun and verb roots
have a lexically assigned tone melody whose surface realization may change
according to grammatical context. Stem-level and phrase-level tonal
processes are complex and appear to count metrical feet in the
(re)assignment of tones. At the clause level, at least three intonational
patterns can be observed: the indicative, interrogative, and the ‘solicitive’.
Morphologically, Ik is mostly agglutinative. Roots and affixes can typically
be separated out linearly. Except for lexicalized prefixes on words borrowed
from other languages, Ik is exclusively suffixing. On the continuum between
analytic and polysynthetic, Ik ranks as moderately synthetic: Only three
suffixes can be attached to noun roots, while up to six can be attached to
verb roots (one more if one counts root reduplication).
In terms of form, verb roots tend to have a (V)(C)VC syllabic shape. Verb
roots can be partially or fully reduplicated, though only full reduplication is
productive. Ik verbs may be intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, or
ambitransitive. Tonal verbal minimal pairs signify only slight semantic
differences, and a small subset of verbs are inherently pluractional.
A basic morphological division in the verbal system is realis-irrealis. This
division is posited more on the basis of morphology than semantics. Other19verbal extensions include suffixes to nominalize the verb, give it directional
deixis, subject agreement, or non-core argument reference. And yet other
suffixes give the verb modal, aspectual, valency-changing, or polarity
properties. Most attributive (descriptive) notions are handled by intransitive
‘adjectival’ verbs in Ik. Tense, contrary to aspect and modality, is
communicated by clitics and lays out a three-level time deixis in both the
past and non-past. Ik uses a variety of strategies to express epistemic status.
The majority of Ik nouns have a CVC(V) or CVCVC(V) syllable shape.
Roughly one third of the nominal lexicon begins with the Teso-Turkana
gender prefix ɲV- (or one of its locative allomorphs) which as been
lexicalized in Ik. Noun roots may also be partially or fully reduplicated,
though neither strategy is productive in the language. Each noun has a
lexical tone melody that can change in various morphological and syntactic
contexts. Nominal suffixes include a two types of singulative, five types of
plurative and eight case endings. The language’s limited noun suffixation is
counterbalanced by productive (pro-)nominal compounding.
Case—an interface of phonology, morphology, syntax—is a pan-systemic
feature of Ik grammar. Not only must every noun be inflected for case, but
even some of the verbal suffixes appear to be grammaticalized case markers.
The Ik case system is split-accusative: Direct objects are marked in the
nominative case with 1/2-person subjects and in the accusative with 3person subjects. In the Ik system, eight cases are observed: nominative,
instrumental, ablative, genitive, accusative, dative, copulative, and oblique.
Nouns and verbs represent the two open lexical word classes in Ik. Other,
closed word classes include the pronouns, quantifiers, demonstratives,
adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, infantile imperatives, ideophones. The
seven personal pronouns incorporate three persons, three numbers, and an
inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person plural. Non-verbal quantifiers
and adverbs exist but are very few. Demonstratives provide spatial deixis in
three degrees of distance (near/medial/far) and temporal deixis in four20degrees of time (tense). Other demonstratives provide anaphoric reference
for either actual discourse or a shared deictic context. Lastly, Ik makes wide
use of ideophones to colorfully enhance the meaning of verbs.
In noun phrases, modifiers follow the head noun. Modifiers consist of
genitive noun phrases, adjectival verbs, quantifiers, and other relative
clauses. Relative pronouns mark the number of their noun head as well as
the tense of the predicate in the relative clause. The fullest statement of the
‘common argument’ of a main and relative clause is in the main clause. Like
in other subordinate clauses, the syntax of relative clauses is marked.
The basic, unmarked constituent order of Ik main clauses is VSO (VS/VAO),
but SVO is attested in subordinate clauses. In a main clause, the verb comes
first, followed by a tense clitic (if present) and then the subject and object(s)
if explicitly mentioned (both subjects and objects may be left implicit in Ik.)
Peripheral arguments come next, followed by any adverbs.
Clause chaining is a definitive aspect of Ik discourse. An initial controlling
clause sets the TAM context for the chain of clauses to follow. Clause chains
may consist of one or many more sequential clauses or one or two
simultaneous clauses. Chained simultaneous clauses may be used as a
complementation strategy and in bi-clausal comparative constructions.
The Ik lexicon exhibits several recognizable substrata. Perhaps the oldest
substratum can simply be called ‘Ik’ since it has yet to be tied to any other
subgroup within Africa. Ik of course shares numerous lexemes with the
other Kuliak languages, Nyang’ía and So. A handful of lexemes have
parallels in Didinga (Surmic). A fair number of Ik lexemes appear to be preor proto-Nilotic, while very many more are obviously cognate with forms in
Eastern, Southern, and even Western Nilotic. A substantial number of core
lexemes are also traceable to Afroasiatic Cushitic languages like Afar/Saho,
Dhaasanac, Tsʼamakko, and West Rift Cushitic. Finally, English (Germanic)
and Swahili (Bantu) have in recent centuries loaned quite a few lexemes.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"276The following sentences are examples of a) Ik motion verbs functioning as
transitive verbs and b) object case (NOM or ACC) marking Direction/Purpose:
(130)Atsaa ƙanesia kuruɓadie ntsi.
ats-á-áƙan-ésí-aOkúrúɓádi-e ntsí-∅come- REAL-PRF get-INF-ACC things-GEN he-GEN

ɪtɛ́-ɛ́s-ákaaɓóŋi-aOreach-INT-REAL Kaabong-ACCtsʼɔɔ
soonHe’ll reach Kaabong soon.
In none of the preceding three sentences would the dative case be
grammatical on the direct object (O) encoding Direction and/or Purpose.
These examples are interesting in that the dative case (next section) is used
more generally to encode both Purpose and Goal/Direction. It is only the
unique combination of these roles that transitivize the verb and objects.
Back to the grammatical functions of the accusative: Its second function is to
mark the overt subject (A/S) of any subordinate clause (except those with
sequential verb forms). In many subordinate clauses, the subject may be left
implicit, though it is always cross-referenced on the verb. When the subject
of a subordinate clause is explicit, it comes before the verb, as opposed to
after the verb like unmarked main clauses. Turkana is also a VSO language.
And it also marks its preverbal subjects with object case, which for it is the
‘absolutive’, the equivalent of the Ik accusative (Dimmendaal 1983:260).","[307, 308]"
"475From a syntactic point of view, Ik employs three types of possessive
construction: 1) A possessee NP head followed by a possessor NP in the
genitive case, 2) a possessor noun and a possessee noun joined in a
compound, in that order. Ik speakers claim there is no difference in meaning
between these two types. 3) The third type of possessive construction is
complex. It consists of a compound with the possessor as the N1 and the
possessum morpheme ɛnɪ ́- as the N2. These two elements alone comprise a
possessive noun phrase, as in ɲj-ɛ́n ‘mine’. But then the possessee can be
specified by putting it in a genitive phrase after the NP head. This
construction can be termed ‘pertensive’ (Dixon 2010b:268), given that the
possessee bears the traditional marking for possessor (the genitive case):

1awa ɲ́cihome I:GEN‘my home’2ɲ́ci-awI:OBL-home‘my home’3ɲj-ɛ́ná awáᵉI[OBL]-PSSM home:GEN‘my home’The types of semantic relationships that Ik possessive constructions can
express include those in (15)-(21). According to Dixon (2012b:263), Ik
would fall into that group of languages worldwide that shows a
comparatively wide range of such relationships:

(21)Nominalization:arutetona ebae
arút-ét-on-aɛ́ba-ᵋsound-INCH-INF- NOMgun-GENthe sound of a gunshot
Ik also uses verbal means to express possession. For example, the verbs tír-és
‘to hold’, i-on ‘to be’, and i-ona ńda ‘to be with’ are all common verbal
alternatives alongside the NP possessive constructions in (14). These verbs
used in this way often translate as ‘to have’. The first, tír-és, is a transitive
verb whose subject would be the possessor and object the possessee. Due to
its high degree of agency, this verb is restricted to human possessors:477(22)Tirida ɲakalama?
tír-íd-aɲákalám-ahold-2SG-REALpen-NOMDo you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you holding a pen’)?
(23)Biraa koroɓaa tiri.
bɪra-akɔ́rɔ́ɓá-atír-í-∅not.be-REAL thing-NOM hold-1SG-REAL
I have nothing (lit. ‘There is nothing I am holding’).
The second ‘have’-verb—i-on ‘to be’—is the language’s locative/existential
copular verb. Used in a possessive way, this verb takes the possessee as its
subject and the possessor as a peripheral argument in the dative case, e.g.:
(24)Iya ɲakalama ncik.
i-aɲákalám-a ɲci-kᵉbe-REAL pen-NOMI-DATI have a pen (lit. ‘There is a pen to me’).
To negate the kind of possessive clause in (24), one has to substitute the
negative locative copula (bɪrá- ‘not be there’) and put the possessor (or more
precisely, the ‘un-possessor’) in the ablative case:
(25)Biraa ɲakalama ncu.
bɪra-aɲákalám-a ɲcu-∅not.be-REAL pen-NOMI-ABLI have no pen (lit. ‘A pen lacks from me’).
The third verb, i-ona ńda ‘to be with’, combines the locative/existential
copula i- with the preposition ńda ‘and/with’. The possessor is the subject of
the verb, and the possessee is a peripheral argument in the oblique case.
When negated with the verb bɪrá- ‘lack’ the oblique-case possessee is marked
on the subordinated verb i- ‘be’ with the dummy pronoun enclitic {=ˊdɛ}:478(26)Iyida nda ɲakalamu?
i-íd-ańꜜdaɲákalámʊbe-2SG-REALwithpen[OBL]Do you have a pen (lit. ‘Are you with a pen’)?
(27)Biraa ɲakalama iyiaad.
bɪra-aɲákalám-a i-í-á=dᵉnot.be-REAL pen-NOMbe-1SG-REAL=DPI don’t have a pen (lit. ‘A pen is lacking that I am with’).
The Teso-Turkana languages bordering Ik, like Karimojong and Turkana,
also convey possession by means of locative/existential copulae. In the
following examples (from Mantovani 1963:9, though morpheme glosses are
my own), the verb ayakau ‘to be (there)’ has the meaning of ‘to have’:
(28)Eyai iyong aite.
eyaííyoŋbe:3SG you:DATáite
cowYou have a cow (lit. ‘A cow is to you’).
(29)Eyakasi iyong ngaatuk.
eyakási íyoŋŋáâtukbe:3PL you:DATcowsYou have cows (lit. ‘Cows are to you’).","[506, 507, 508, 509, 510]"
"7 Verbs
The Ik language’s second large, open word class besides nouns is verbs. This
chapter begins with an overview of verb roots (§7.1) and then moves on to
describe various verbal suffixes and verb-building mechanism (§7.2-§7.11).
In Ik, a verb is a word whose primary grammatical function is to be the
head of the predicate. As head of the predicate, a verb can take a variety of
inflectional affixes, including those for subject agreement, mood, modality,
valency, and aspect. A secondary grammatical function of the Ik verb is to
be the head of a noun phrase. For a verb to adopt this function, it must first
be nominalized with one of the language’s several nominalizing suffixes.
A prototypical member of the Ik verb class predicates the action, state,
location, or characteristic of its subject. Some concepts covered by an
adjective class in other languages—like color, size, and shape—are covered
by special adjectival verbs in Ik. And other concepts conveyed by nouns in
many languages are also encoded in Ik with nominalized verbs.
At an abstract lexical level, some words are neither verb nor noun until they
receive verbal or nominal affixes. These include words like deƙu- ‘quarrel’,
ƙaƙa- ‘hunt’, tɔkɔba- ‘cultivate’, and many others (see also §4 on nouns).
When such lexemes are used as verbs, they receive verbal affixes like subject
agreement markers. When they are used as nouns, they receive nominal
affixes like case markers. So while the word classes of verb and noun can
normally be clearly distinguished in Ik on the basis of syntax and semantics,
their boundaries do overlap with a fair number of lexemes.
A verbal word in Ik consists minimally of a verbal root plus one inflectional
affix. With the exception of reduplicated roots and fossilized prefixes, all
verbal inflectional and derivational affixes in Ik are suffixes.","[332, 333]"
"1.2.4 Vitality
In contrast to the other, endangered Kuliak (Rub) languages, Ik language is
still vital. According to the EGIDS scale (Simons & Lewis 2010), Ik is a level
6 ‘vigorous’, since “the language is used by all generations and the situation
is sustainable.” Small children are still learning it as their mother tongue
and typically remain monolingual for at least six years. After that, they may
begin to pick up English or Teso-Turkana from school and/or travels outside
Ikland. Ik young people face a subtle pressure to learn Teso-Turkana as a
language of wider communication. It is especially useful in trade, travel, and
simple physical survival. A fair number of Ik children attend primary
schools in towns and thus have to learn one of these languages in order to
learn from the teachers. But adding Teso-Turkana, English, or Swahili (in
Kenyan schools) to the repertoire of Ik youth has not so far diminished the
vitality of Ik in the homeland. There, Ik is still spoken in all domains of life,
with the exception of local community schools (if teachers are non-Ik) and
in Christian churches (with non-Ik songs or visiting non-Ik preachers).",[57]
"9.11.2 Left-dislocation
Another way the language alters the pragmatic status of an argument is to
left-dislocate it before the main clause. Doing so highlights the topicality of
that argument. Ik left-dislocation can be formulated as follows, where S
stands for the main clause and S´ stands for the sentence encompassing the
main clause and preposed argument (notation from Payne 1997:274):
(160)Ik left-dislocation:[NP-NOM S]S´524The left-dislocated constituent may be a simple noun or a complex NP with
modifiers like relative clauses. Unlike clefted constituents which take the
copulative case, left-dislocated arguments take the nominative case. Besides
being left-dislocated, the highlighted argument is set apart from the main
clause by a clear pause. It may also receive solicitive intonation which
consists of a rising boundary tone at the end of the NP (see §3.3.5).
In the first example below, the main clause subject roɓa ‘people’, along with
its modifying relative clause, gets dislocated leftward. As predicted
typologically (Payne 1997:275), the preposed agent NP is recapitulated in
the main clause by means of the 3PL subject-agreement suffix {-át(i)-}:
(161)Roɓa ni uga ɲogoliɗiaa, dzigwata atik.
roɓ-a=niúɡ-aɲɔ́ɡɔ́l ɪɗɪ-aá ‖ dzíɡw-at-apeople-NOM=REL.PL dig-REAL gold-ACCbuy-3PL-REALátí-kᵃ
FILL-ACCPeople who dig for gold, they buy um…
In the next example, it is the object of the main clause (komos) that is leftdislocated. It is further highlighted by a substantial pause, which can be
discerned in the example by the presence of final form (no final vowel).
Note, however, that the left-dislocated object is not recapitulated in the
main clause. This is not surprising for two reasons: 1) Direct objects are not
cross-referenced on verbs like subjects are, and 2) Ik tends to drop subjects
and objects in all types of clauses (where they are understood contextually).
(162)Komos, duƙesuƙoida ceŋetiaamak.
komos-∅‖hindquarter-NOMduƙ-és-úƙó-íd-aceŋetí-áma-kᵉtake-INT -AND -2SG-REALinlaw-AGT.SG-DATThe hindquarter, you will take (it) to your in-law.
Peripheral arguments can also be left-dislocated. In this last example below,
the preposed argument cua ‘water’ has the semantic role of ‘means’ in the
main clause. It is recognized as topic here by the nominative case and525solicitive intonation consisting of a low-rising boundary tone. And it is
recapitulated in the main clause through the dummy pronoun {-ˊdɛ} which
indicates that a non-core (instrumental) argument has been relocated:
(163)Cua dii nii, taa ntsuo epesuƙotanad.
cu-a=ꜜdíí=nií‖taawater-NOM=ANPH=DEM.PLntsú-ó ep-és-úƙot-an-á=dᵉQUOT it-COPsleep-INT -COMP-IPS-REAL=DPThat water there, okay, that’s what people will go to sleep on (i.e.
having drunk it to satisfy their thirst).","[555, 556, 557]"
"482Ik clauses may be intransitive, transitive, or distransitive. At the notional
level, intransitive clauses minimally require a subject (S) as an argument.
Transitive clauses minimally require an agent (A) and object (O), while
ditransitives requires an agent (A), object (O), and extended object (E).
However, in Ik, some or all core arguments may be omitted (left implicit) in
the surface structure. As such, Ik is not just a pro-drop language (which it is)
but also an ‘argument-drop’ language. Consider these examples:
(39)Maƙotia naa kaudza ntsik.
ma-ƙot-í-aVA=naakaúdz-aOntsí-kᵉEgive-AND-1SG -REAL=PST1money-NOMs/he-DATI gave the money to him.

(42)Maƙotia nak.
ma-ƙot-í-aVA=nakᵃ∅O∅Egive-AND-1SG -REAL=PST1
I gave (something) (to somebody).
These four examples show progressively the omission of one or the other—
and then all—core arguments from the surface structure (though of course
the clause subject is always cross-referenced on the main verb).","[513, 514]"
"2526.3.2 Nominative
The nominative case suffix {-a} has engendered more than its share of
confusion in the descriptive literature. Referring to this morpheme, Heine &
König state that “Like Crazzolara, we consider the ‘complemental suffix’ to
be a functionally empty appendage of nouns…in their unmarked form.
Accordingly, it is interpreted as a morphologically redundant ending…”
(1996:137). Later, the segmental similarity between the nominative {-a}
and the accusative {-(k)a} led to the following comment (König 2008:73):
“The final vowel -a has a unique value in the system. All words or
particles of the language end by default in the vowel -a, and so are
nominative and accusative case forms (in the non-final form). It
remains unclear whether the - a of the nominative and accusative is
triggered by the general rule of the language to use vowel -a as a
default ending of each word or whether -a has the value of an
independent case suffix encoding nominative or accusative.”
By contrast, the claim made in this grammar is that the morpheme {-a} is
functionally very significant, as both a marker of nominative case and realis
modality in the verbal system (§7.6.2). This morpheme has a L tone but
assimilates to the tone melody projected by the stem it attaches to (T7). It is
one of the language’s opaque dominant suffixes (§3.1.3), and as such can
also be represented as {-a+}. One if the nominative’s characteristics that has
produced confusion in the past is its subtraction of stem-final vowels. It and
the instrumental case suffix {-ɔ} are the only two cases that do this. Before
pauses, the nominative surfaces as /-ᵃ/ or /-∅/. Lastly, if a noun’s final
vowel is a back vowel, it may desyllabify before {-a}:253(56)Nominative case paradigm

predict whether the vowel will be deleted or desyllabified. Out of a sample
of sixty-eight nouns ending in a back vowel, only the following fifteen
(22%) underwent desyllabification (in order of root-final back vowel):

vowel entirely in the nominative and instrumental cases (see next section),
as in sɔkɔ́- → sɔk-a ‘root- NOM’ and habu- → hab-a ‘tree.hive-NOM’. Looking at
nouns that delete their final vowel versus those that desyllabify it, the
reason for this discrepancy is not obvious. It likely represents a historical
morphological change toward or away from desyllabification. That
nominative-case desyllabification is lexical and not post-lexical is shown by
the fact that compensatory lengthening does not occur on the case suffix.
Back vowels also desyllabify after the non-final accusative case allomorph /a/, but when they do, compensatory lengthening occurs. For example,
compare dakú- ‘tree’ as dakw-a ‘tree-NOM’ and as dakw-áá ‘tree-ACC’.
The nominative case marks out the following five grammatical functions:

"5.1.4 Bound personal pronouns
The Ik bound personal pronouns are verbal suffixes. For this reason, they
are also treated under §7.4, where their verbal properties are discussed.
They have the same person and number distinctions as their free207counterparts. They are viewed as suffixes because 1) they cannot stand
alone as a word, and 2) they can be preceded or followed by other verbal
suffixes (unlike most clitics). Their grammatical function is to crossreference the subject of the clause. (9) presents the Ik bound personal
pronouns in the unmarked [-ATR] and marked [+ATR] allomorphs:
(8)Ik bound pronominal suffixes
[-ATR][+ATR]1SG-ɪ ́ɪ ́-íí2SG-ɪ ́dɪ-ídi3SG-ɪ-i1PL.EXC-ɪ ́mɪ ́-ímí1PL.INC-ɪ ́sɪ ́nɪ-ísíni2PL-ɪ ́tɪ ́-ítí3PL-áti—A few comments are in order for the forms in (8). First, the 2SG pronominal
suffix {-ɪ ́dɪ} has the tone melody HL due to the presence of the depressor
consonant /d/. Depending on the verb stem it attaches to, it can surfaces as
LL but never as HH. Along the same lines, the 3PL suffix {-áti-} also has a HL
tone melody. It can surface as LL but never as HH. Although it does not
contain a depressor consonant currently, it seems quite likely that the /t/ in
{-áti-} has developed historically from /d/ as in *-ádi. This cannot be
proven, but such a development would help explain the HL tone melody.
The 3PL suffix is also dominantly [+ATR] as described back in §3.1.3.
As is common cross-linguistically, the Ik bound pronominal suffixes are
probably eroded forms of (at least some of) the free forms shown in (1). The
devolution of ɲ́ ci- to {-ɪ ́ɪ ́}, for example, may have involved the
reinterpretation of /ɲ/ as the high front vowel /i/ leading to [íci]. (In this
vein, compare the Ik free form ntsí- ‘he/she/it’ to the So oblique 3SG
pronominal ici- (Carlin 1993:79)). The loss of /c/ from ɲ́ci- could then have
happened as a result of a process similar to the ‘/c/ to [i]’ variation found in208So (McKinney 2009). This would have then created a form like [íi] which
then could have become [-íí]. The change in [ATR] in this speculative
scenario, if true, would have to be explained by other means.
Secondly, the correlation between the 2PL free form biti- and the bound form
{-ítí} is suggestive, apart from the problem of tone difference. If the bound
pronoun is an eroded remnant of the free form, then this would reflect an
historical ‘/b/-drop’ sound change (*biti → -iti) that must have affect the 2SG
form as well (*bi(d)i → -idi). The latter postulation, of course, requires
positing a lost /d/ as well as a lost /b/ for the 2SG pronoun. Historical /b/dropping is elsewhere attested among archaic kinship terms (see §4.4.).
The current shape of the 1PL.EXC pronominal {-ɪ ́mɪ ́} bears noteworthy
resemblance to the Nyang’ía 1PL.EXC pronoun mis (Heine 1975a), the loss of
/s/ notwithstanding. And in the case of the Ik 1PL.INC pronominal {-ɪ ́sɪ ́nɪ}, a
simple change of /j/ to /s/ could have produced it from the free form ɲjíní(with changes in tone and [ATR]). The plausability of these proposals will
have to be judged as further comparative evidence comes to light.","[238, 239, 240]"
"In (43), the S of the first clause (ŋkᵃ) becomes the O of the second clause
(ɲ́ cikᵃ). This is reflected in the case-marking change from the nominative in
the first clause to the accusative in the second (due to the fact that 3rd
person agents in Ik always take direct objects in the accusative case).
For transitive verbs, the original transitive agent (A) becomes the direct
object (O) of the new agentive causer which is now (A). And the original
direct object becomes an extended object (E) marked with the dative case:
(44)Ŋabia nka ɲokoti.
ŋáb-i-a[ŋk-a]A [ɲókóti-∅]Owear-1SG-REAL I-NOMcoat-NOMI’m wearing a coat.
(45)Ŋabitieeta ncia ɲokotiik.
ŋáb-it-i-et-a[ɲ́ci-a]O[ɲókótií-kᵉ]Ewear-CAUS-PLUR-INCH-REALI-ACCcoat-DATHe makes me wear a coat.
Lastly, for extended transitive verbs, the original transitive subject (A)
becomes the direct object (O), while the original direct object becomes the484first extended object (E1) marked with the dative case. And the original
extended object (E1) becomes the second extended object (E2), also in the
dative case. This construction puts Ik in the company of the relatively few
languages worldwide—like Japanese, Turkish, and Kamaiurá—that allow
more than one dative noun phrase in the same clause (Dixon 2012:264):
(46)Maƙotiaa nka kaudza konie amae.
ma-ƙot-í-a-a[ŋk-a]A [kaúdz-a]O [kɔnɪ-ɛámá-ᵉ]E1give-AND-1SG -REAL-PRFI-NOMperson-GENmoney-NOM one-DATI have given the money to another person.

"5389.13.2 Complementation strategies
Besides the toimɛna-clause types described above, Ik also uses two further
complementation strategies: 1) nominalization and 2) clause chaining.
The verbal element of a complement clause can be nominalized instead of
appearing as a full finite verb. This is a commonly used complementation
strategy in Ik. Nominalized verbal complements can fill any core or noncore argument slot and thus take any required case ending. If the subject of
the nominalized verb needs to be specified, for example if it differs from the
main clause subject, it directly follows the complement verb in the genitive
case. And if the nominalized verb is transitive, then its object also follows it
(and the subject) in the genitive case. This means that if the complement
clause is transitive and has a different subject than the matrix clause, the
nominalized verb may be followed by two nouns in the genitive case.
For example in (200), the nominalized verb sáɓ-és ‘to kill (pl.)’ is the subject
(S) of the intransitive verb ɡaan-ón ‘to be bad’ and therefore takes the
nominative case. Within the nominalized complement clause, sáɓ-és is a
transitive verb with an object marked in the genitive case:
(200)Gaana saɓesa roɓae.
ɡaan-aV[sáɓ-és-aVA[roɓa-ᵉ]O]Sbad-REALkill[PL]-INF -NOMpeople-GENKilling people is bad (lit. ‘The killing of people is bad’).
The next example presents a nominalized transitive clause filling the object
slot of a matrix transitive clause. The transitive verb bol-és-úƙotᵃˊ ‘to stop
(doing something)’ has the nominalized clause ɪmɔɗɛsɪ ́á wicé as its object,
with ɪmɔɗ-ɛsˊ marked with the accusative case (since the subject of the main
verb in the matrix clause is 3-person). Then, within the complement clause
itself, the nominalized verb ɪmɔɗ-ɛsˊ ‘to deceive’ has its direct object encoded
as a possessive modifier in the genitive case:539(201)Boluƙotataa imoɗesia wice.
bol-uƙot-át-a-aVA[ɪmɔɗ-ɛsɪ ́-áVA[wicé-∅]O]Ostop-COMP-3PL-REAL-PRF deceive-INF -ACC children-GEN
They’ve stopped deceiving children.
Nominalized verbs can also fill peripheral argument slots. In the next
example, the nominalized verb ɪráb-ɛs ‘to harvest millet’ is filling the slot of
a peripheral argument in the dative case, denoting purpose:
(202)Botuo cikama rebeaƙok, irabesik.
bot-u-ocɪkám-árébe-aƙɔ-kᵋ[ɪráb-ɛsɪ ́-kᵋ]PERIPHERALmove-3SG-SEQwomen-NOM millet-inside-DAT harvest.millet-INF- DATAnd the women moved to the millet for harvesting (it).
The peripheral argument can be a complex complement clause appended to
a main clause as if it were the last in series of noun phrases. In this next
example, an entire transitive clause is encapsulated in multiple embedded
noun phrases that fill an oblique argument slot in a preceding matrix clause:
(203)...nda ʝa saɓesi ntsie loŋotae.
ńꜜda=ʝa[sáɓ-ésiVntsí-éAlɔŋɔ́tá-ᵋO]PERIPHERALand=ADVkill[PL]-INF [OBL]he-GENenemies-GEN...and then he killed the enemies (‘the killing of him of enemies’).
Finally, a nominalized complement clause can occur as a predicative
nominal in a verbless copula clause like the one in (204). This clause was
uttered to an elder as an explanation for the aches and pains of growing old:
(204)Dunesio ata dee.
dún-ési-oát-á=ꜜdééage-INF- COP FILL-NOM=ANPH.SG
That thing (i.e. feeling ill) is ageing.","[569, 570, 571]"
"Any core arguments in an imperative clause take the oblique case. This
includes subjects and direct objects. Imperative subjects are also claimed to
exist in Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983:179), but they could also be vocatives.
And as König noted, the use of the oblique for core arguments in the
imperative mood is another example of case neutralization in Ik (2008:7):
(132)Ƙaidee ɗi nak.
ƙái-d-e-eɗɪ=nákᵃgo-bring-VEN-IMP.SGone[OBL]=DEM.SG.PST1Go bring the earlier one.
(133)Ogoyuo biti ati na.
óɡo-íóbitiátí=naleave-IMP.PLyou.PL[OBL]FILL[OBL]=DEM.SGYou (pl.) leave this whatcha-ma-callitǃ359The imperative verb in (132) is a fusion of two verbs, ƙa- ‘go’ and d-et‘bring’ that have been reanalyzed as a single verb. This is evident from
phrases spoken by children, like ƙáidetineˊ ‘Let me go-and-bring’. The object
of this transitive verb in (132) is ɗɪ in the oblique case. As for (133), both
the subject biti ‘you (pl.)’ and the object átí ‘filler word’ are in the oblique.
On an imperative verb stem, the imperative suffixes are usually the last
morpheme. Only the dummy pronoun enclitic {=ˊdɛ} can follow them:
(134)Irimitete nc.
ɪrɪ ́m-ɪ ́t-ɛt-ɛ́ɲ́cⁱspin-CAUS-VEN-IMP.SGI[OBL]Spin me around.
(135)Tsaituƙotuo kwetik.
tsá-ít-uƙot-úókwɛt-ɪkᵃdry-CAUS-COMP-IMP.PLhand-PL[OBL]Dry your hands.
(136)Yanuod.
ɪ ̯án-ʊ́ɔ=
́ dᵋ
talk-IMP.PL=DP
Talk to them.","[390, 391]"
"In the first place, the verb stem in (53) combines the verb root fút- ‘blow’
with the andative directional suffix {-ʊƙɔ(tɪ ́)-}. This combination normally
yields the tone melody HHL, as it does with the 2PL form above. Adding
then the subject-agreement marker, with its H tones, the full stem melody
surfaces as HHLHH. In the 2SG form, however, the HH tone sequence on the
subject-agreement suffix is repelled by the presence of /d/, bouncing the HH
sequence back on TBU. This results in a stem melody of HHHHL.
High-tone repellence often interacts with high-tone insertion (see §3.2.4).
High-tone insertion stipulates that upon a sequence of four L tones across
morpheme boundaries, a H tone must be inserted on the third TBU. If no
depressor is involved, the H insertion has no obstacle. But if the consonant
before the third TBU is a depressor, the inserted H gets repelled back onto
the second TBU instead. In this light, compare the following two sentences:
(54)i-akuwa-kᵉ→ia kúwakᵉ→iá bosikᵉ   be-REAL grass-DAT
It’s in the grass.
(55)i-abosi-kᵉbe-REAL ear-DAT
It’s in the ear.
Before leaving the topic of consonant-tone interaction, a comment is in
order about the ejectives /ƙ/ and /tsʼ/. While depressor consonants lower
pitch significantly, these ejectives raise pitch slightly. It seems that the
glottalic release of pressure of an ejective, accompanied by voicing in114following vowels, creates a slight rise in phonetic pitch. In the following
examples, the phonetic pitch notation is only approximate:
(56)Enia ƙɔɓa ntsi.
en-í-aꜜƙɔɓ-a ntsí-∅see-1SG-REAL navel-NOM he-GEN

"380The Ik pluractional aspect is an expression of grammatical number in the
verbal system. Broadly speaking, it signals that the meaning of a given verb
applies more than once. This could be because the subject is plural, the object
is plural, or simply that the action or state occurs more than once. Such
grammatical plurality has various finer nuances that have elsewhere been
called ‘distributive, ‘habitual’, ‘iterative, ‘frequentative’, etc.—the term
‘pluractional’ is therefore intended to cover all of them.
The Ik pluractional is versatile in that it can take singular or plural subjects
and/or objects. This means that it does not conform to the prototypical
African pluractional verb described by Dimmendaal as those that “express
the involvement of a plural (as against as singular) subject in the case of
intransitive verbs and repetition of some action as applied to plural objects
(as against a singular object) in the case of transitive verbs...” (2010:10).
The following first examples of the pluractional show how it spreads
[+ATR] harmony to the preceding root:
(182)ƙɔɗ-‘cry’→Ƙoɗiya ʝiik.
ƙoɗ-í-áʝíikⁱcry-PLUR-REALalwaysShe’s always crying.
(183)ɪnɔ́m-‘beat’→Inomiyata ncik.
inom-í-át-aɲci-kᵃbeat- PLUR-3PL-REAL I-ACC
They usually beat me.
Then the following sentences are given to illustrate each of the different
nuances of the pluractional {-í-} is capable of expressing:381(184)Dayaakit.
da-i-aak-ít-ᵃDISTRIBUTIVEnice-PLUR-DISTR-2PL-REAL
You all are lovely.
(185)Wetiyida lotoɓa?

(186)Deyeetuǃ
de-í-et-úREPETITIVEbring-PLUR-VEN-IMP.PL
Be bringing (repeatedly)ǃ
Some uses of the pluractional suffix are fairly clear-cut semantically, like the
ones shown above. However, in many situations, the interpretation of the
sufffix’s meaning relies on the pragmatic context. Take this example:
(187)Na ƙanaa ɲarema birayoo,
na=ƙánaaɲárɛ́m-abɪra-ɪ ́-ɔɔ́CONJ =CONDinsecurity-NOM lack-3SG-SEQƙaiisina ƙanak.
ƙa-í-ísin-aƙanakᵃgo-PLUR-1PL.INC-REALCONDThe sentence in (187) could be given any of the following three

b) If insecurity were not there, we would go more than once.
c) If insecurity were not there, we would go often.","[411, 412, 413]"

"388The grammatical relations involved with the Ik passive differ from those in
Teso-Turkana. For example, in Toposa, bordering Ik to the north, the normal
nominative-accusative marking system changes to ergative-absolutive in the
passive: The subject of an intransitive passive sentence is encoded with the
accusative case rather than the nominative (Schröder 2008:59). While a
similar situation obtains for the Ik impersonal passives, for the passive
marked by {-ɔ́sɪ ́-}, the sole verbal argument is treated syntactically as S, not
O. This is shown by the syntax of subordinate clauses, as explained next.
In most types of Ik subordinate clauses, any overt subject comes before the
verb in the ACC case, and any overt direct object follows the verb, also in the
ACC case. (197) shows the passive clause in (195) as a complement to theverbless copulative clause isio ‘It is what... (i.e. ‘why?’)’. In the subordinate
complement clause, the word asak ‘door’ is put before the verb, indicating
that it is viewed as the syntactic subject (S) of (197). If asak is put after the
verb, as if it were an object, the result is ungrammatical (198). The same
process is seen taking place between (196) and (199)-(200) as in:
(197)Isio asakaa kokosad?
isi-oásaka-akɔk-ɔ́s-á=dᵉwhat-COPdoor-ACCclose-PASS-REAL=DPWhy is the door closed?

**isi-oŋƙ-ɔ́s-ɛ́=ɛtɔbɔŋɔ́-kᵃ**what-COP eat-PASS-REAL=DPposho-ACC**Why is the posho eaten?
Unexpectedly, the suffix {-ɔ́sɪ ́-} is also found on transitive verbs still acting
in transitive clauses. That is, the passive does not have a solely
detransitivizing function. In its non-detransitivizing function, the Ik passive
adds the stative nuance ‘habitually characterized by X’ to the meaning of
verb X. In the next few sentences, the passive suffix is used even though the
clauses remain transitive with an A and O (though O may be dropped):

"499Likewise, in the relative clause itself, the CA can also have any core or
peripheral function. Since the CA is only stated in the MC and not in the RC,
it is not relevant to comment on the nominal case in which the CA in an RC
may occur. If it is the subject of the RC, the CA is cross-refenced on the verb
with subject-agreement pronominals. If it is the object, then it is inferred
from the grammatical context. If it is a peripheral argument, it is crossreferenced on the verb with the dummy pronominal {=ˊdɛ}. But regardless
of what type of argument the CA is in the RC, it is represented by one of the
relative pronouns which are the topic of the next section, §9.8.2.
The following three examples show the CA in relative clauses functioning as
subject, object, and peripheral argument, respectively. The CA in (92), ámá‘person’, acts as the subject of the verb iwák- ‘holler’ in the MC, while in the
RC, it is the agent of the causativized verb tsídz-it-ét- ‘flush out’:
(92)Ama na tsamu tsidziteta inoa iwakuk.
[ám-á =[natsídz-it-et-aínó-a]RCiwák-ú-kᵒ]MCperson-NOM=REL.SG carry-CAUS-VEN- REAL animal-ACC holler-3SG -SEQ
The person who flushes out an animal hollers an alarm.
By contrast, the CA in (93) is a core argument marked with the dative case
in the main clause (dakú-é) but the object of the transitive verb kam-ʊƙɔt‘take hold of’ in the relative clause. The non-CA agent of the RC,

Lastly, the noun phrase in (94), introduced by the preposition kóteré
‘because of’, marks the CA kaɪnɪ́- ‘year’ as peripheral argument in the
oblique case. In the relative clause, this CA is would also be a peripheral500argument but one marked with the instrumental case (since it is a time
concept). Because of that, its absence in the relative clause is marked with
the dummy pronoun on the transitive verb kʊp-ʊƙɔt- ‘burn up’:

"7.10 Adjectivals
Dixon asserts that every language has an adjectival word class, regardless of
how similar it may be to either nouns or verbs (2010:62). Crosslinguistically, ‘adjectives’ tend to be distinguished as a distinct word class
based on relative similarities or differences between them and nouns or
verbs. The following diagram presents a typology of ‘adjectives’ in which
similarity and difference are modeled as spatial distance (Dixon 2010:66):
(237)a)NOUNb)NOUNc)
d)ADJECTIVE
ADJECTIVE
NOUNNOUNVERB
VERBADJECTIVE
ADJECTIVEVERB
VERB402According to this typology, Ik is a type (a) language whose adjectives
exhibit many verb-like characteristics. So many that, despite Dixon’s
assertion, ‘adjectives’ are treated here as an ‘adjectival’ subset of intransitive
verbs instead of their own, separate word class. This is because,
morpologically and syntactically, they are just like other intransitive verbs.
Nonetheless, their semantics do cover categories traditionally handled by
adjectives, as shown below. And a handful of suffixes are found only on
‘adjectival’ verbs, also as described in the following sections.
The semantic properties encoded by adjectival verbs include the following:

ʝal-án-‘different’First, just like other intransitive verbs, Ik adjectival verbs encode these
semantic properties by being the head of a clause’s predicate. In (248), the
intransitive verb i- ‘be (somewhere)’ fills the clause-initial slot for main
verbs, as does the adjectival verb maráŋ- ‘good’. This syntactic slot reserved
for verbs (in unmarked clauses) as well as the verbal realis affix {-a} show
that maráŋ- is functioning as the predicate head in example two of (248):
(248)Iya Ɲakuj.","[433, 434, 435, 436]"
"390The sentences in (201) and (203) are normal, simple transitive clauses with
A and O. These then are modified by the passive suffix {-ɔ́sɪ ́-} in (202) and
(204) without causing a decrease in clausal valence. In this sense, {-ɔ́sɪ ́-} can
apparently be used in a non-passivizing way to draw attention to how a
transitive situation characterizes the subject as well as affecting the object.
The story does not end there: The suffix {-ɔ́sɪ ́-} is also found on intransitive
verbs like the ones in (205). When occuring with intransitive verbs, the
{-ɔ́sɪ ́-} is obviously not behaving as a canonical passive, since there is no
change in transitivity. Instead, it basically turns a merely intransitive verb
into a stative one. In this function, the verb root is usually reduplicated to
express the stative notions of habitual or repetitive characteristicness:

(206)Functional summary of the Ik passive {-ɔ́sɪ́-}

promoting the object (O) to subject (S).","[421, 422]"
"275The claim is that objects that have a more prototypical Patient role are more
likely to be marked differently (e.g. with an accusative case) than those
without it. Since prototypical Patients are [-volitional], and since volition
implies animacy, it is claimed that objects further down the cline toward
inanimacy are more likely to be marked differentially (Dimm. 2010:39).
The concept of prototypical transitivity seems applicable to Ik splitaccusativity, but along slightly different lines. In Ik, volition, instigation,
affectedness, and animacy alone do not determine whether an object will be
marked with the accusative case or nominative case. By contrast, the only
relevant factor is whether the Agent of a transitive clause is present in the
conversation, i.e. is a speech-act participant (3 person). If the Agent
(animate or inanimate) is not speaker or addressee, then the object must
take the accusative case. Thus, taking Ik into account, the feature
[±participant] can be added to Næss’ definition of prototypical transitivity.
An Agent that is not a speech-act participant (3 person) embodies a greater
degree of transitivity because its intention (if animate) or capability (if
inanimate) is inaccessible and therefore not knowable or assessable. This
puts greater semantic ‘distance’ between the Agent and Patient than if the
Agent was a speech-act particpant who could be negotiated with. This, then,
is one further attempt to make sense of Ik’s person-based split-accusativity.
Another question relevant to the Ik accusative case is what semantic roles
the object of a transitive clause can take. This question applies to transitive
objects generally, including those marked in the nominative case. Ik direct
objects encode the expected semantic role of Patient, but they can also
encode Direction and/or Purpose. Three Ik verbs of motion—ats- ‘come’, ƙa‘go’, and ɪtá- ‘reach’—are unusual in that they can behave like transitive
verbs. Similar motion-verb properties have been reported as common in
Cushitic and Omotic languages (Dimmendaal 2003:100). Old Nubian is
reported to have marked Patients and Directions with the suffix -ka, while
the Semitic language Tigrinya uses its accusative prefix ni-/nä- to mark
Patients, Directions, and many other roles (Dimmendaal 2010:41).","[306, 307]"
"2025.1.1 Free personal pronouns
The Ik free personal pronouns are free grammatical words. The hyphenated
forms in (1) signify not prefixation but rather roots in need of case suffixes:

(2) presents a non-final form case paradigm for all seven free personal
pronouns. The nominative and instrumental case forms for 1SG reflect the
morpho-phonological de-affrication described in §2.5.2. And in the ablative
and copulative cases, there is some variation in the degree to which the
pronoun-final /i/ assimilates to the case suffix consisting of /o/ (§2.5.4):

relationship between the first person free pronouns: the singular ɲ́ ci- ‘I’, and
the plural ŋɡó- and ɲjíní- ‘we’. It looks like the 1PL.INC ɲjíní- is a pluralization
of the first person singular ɲ́ ci-. Recall from §4.2.5 that the possessive
plurative {-ɪnɪ} may be used to pluralize a possessed or associated person or
object. In light of this, the 1PL.INC ɲjíní- can be analyzed as ɲc+ɪnɪ- → ɲc-íní→ ɲjíní-. The change in voicing from /c/ to /j/ is seen in modern Ik in
another pronominal form: ɲj-ɛ́nɪ́- ‘mine’, where -ɛ́nɪ́ is an impersonal
possessum marker (§5.2). Semantically, the first person plural inclusive
pronoun may have grammaticalized from a word meaning something like
‘my Xs’ or ‘those associated with me’, i.e., including you the addressee(s).
Second, there also seems to be a morphological relationship between the
first person plural exclusive ŋɡó- and both ɲ́ ci- and ɲjíní-. While the link
between ɲ́ ci- and ɲjíní- hinges on the voicing alternation /c/~/j/, a link
between ɲjíní- and ŋɡó- is suggested by the de-affrication described in
§2.5.2. In short, affricates tend to surface as stops before the vowels /a/ or
/ɔ, o/, and /j/~/ɡ/ is a well-attested example. So the pronoun ɲjíní- could
alternatively be a pluralization of ŋɡó-, where ɲj- is the underlying
morpheme, hardened to ɲɡ- before /o/. So although the evolutionary
direction taken by these three first-person pronouns cannot yet be
determined, it seems that a proto-morpheme *ɲj/ɲc/ŋɡ underlies them all.
Then, in terms of areal and possibly genetic parallels, the 1SG pronoun ɲ́ cirecalls the 1SG possessive cú of Dhaasanac (Tosco 2001:64), and in its
nominative form (ŋ́k-) the Eastern Semitic anaku and East Cushitic ani/anu.
Tucker even suggested a link between Ik pronouns and ‘Erythraic’, using
Middle Egyptian as a reference point (1967b:675). The Ik 1PL.EXC ŋɡóclosely resembles the 1PL.INC ŋwɔnɪ́ of Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983:207).
Although these two pronouns differ in clusivity, their relationship looks
promising. Otherwise, the Ik free pronouns most closely resemble those of
the other Kuliak languages, as shown below (in comparison with Turkana):204(3)Kuliak free personal pronouns

The paradigm shows significant unity among the Kuliak languages, but
some marked influence from Teso-Turkana, particularly in 1SG and 1PL.EXC.
Syntactically, the free personal personal pronouns behave like full nouns.
Their ability to inflect for case allows them to replace any noun operating as
any clausal argument. As shown below, they can even be modified by
demonstratives (3) and relative clauses (4):
(3)Ƙamie njinie nii,...
ƙám-í-eɲjíní-e=niílike-3SG-SIMLwe.INC-GEN=DEM.PLLike we here (for example)…
(4)Bita ni muɗukanaakit,...
bit-a=nimúɗúk-án-aak-ít-ᵃyou.PL-NOM =REL.PL blind-STAT-DISTR-2PL-REAL
You who are blind,...
Ik is a pro-drop language, so the free personal pronouns are not required if
their referent is a subject or object. They can be used in addition to the
pronominal subject-agreement suffixes if more emphasis is needed.","[233, 234, 235, 236]"
"531Some paradigmatic similarity can be seen between the interrogative words
and specific indefinite pronouns (as predicted by Dixon 2012:401):
(180)Comparative interrogative/indefinite paradigm
InterrogativeIndefinitend-aí-‘where?’kɔ́n-áí-‘somewhere’ńtɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘which (sg.)?’kɔ́nɛ́-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘a, some (sg.)’ńtí-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘which (pl.)?’kíní-ɛ́nɪ ́-‘some (pl.)’ńtó-odów‘which day?’kón-(i)t-ódoi‘some day’The main demonstrable difference between the word classes in (180) is that
the first term in the interrogatives is the interrogative proto-form *nd/nt-,
while in the indefinite pronouns, it is various forms of the root kɔnɪ́- ‘one’. It
should be clear from the table in (180) and these preceding notes that the
etymological basis for Ik interrogatives is a proto-form like *nd/nt- (with
variable tone). This fits well with Ehret’s lexical reconstruction of protoNilo-Saharan in which he posits *nda and *ndi as proto-NS roots for ‘what?’,
*ndé for ‘which?’, and *ndoː for ‘who?’ (2001:310-311). The word isi- ‘what’
is more mysterious in that it has no watertight parallels in Kuliak or TesoTurkana, nor is it mentioned in Ehret 2001. One possible link may be to the
Kuliak So’s interrogative particle ii/ic ‘who?’ (Heine & Carlin 2010:17).
The interrogative verbs shown in (180) conjugate fully as an other verb.
This is illustrated next with a paradigm of the verb taná- ‘be how many?’:
(181)Conjugation of the interrogative verb taná1SGtaná-ɪ ́‘How many am I?’2SGtaná-ɪ ́dᵃ‘How many are you?’3SGtaná‘How many is s/he/it?’1PL.EXCtaná-ɪ ́tᵃ‘How many are you (pl.)?’1PL.INCtaná-ɪ ́m‘How many are we (exc.)?’2PLtaná-ɪ ́sɪn‘How many are we (inc.)?’3PLtaná-átᵃ‘How many are they?’532The verb taná- when used with singular subjects pragmatically conveys a
measure of skepticism or even indignation. For instance, if someone is being
asked to do too much alone, they might respond with tanáɪ ́ ‘How many am
I?’ Or similarly, if someone is boasting of all he can accomplish, one might
rightfully inquire tanáɪd́ ‘How many are you?’
The (pro)nominal interrogative words from (180) can replace clausal
constituents right where they are, whether the clause is structurally
unmarked (as in 182) or changed to a verbless clause (as in 183):

"4969.8Relative clausesBecause many Ik subordinate clauses are based on the relative clause
construction, relative clauses need to be discussed without further delay. To
begin with, Ik exhibits a canonical relative clause construction having the
following characteristics (the first four drawn from Dixon 2010:314):
1. The relative clause (RC) is embedded in a main clause (MC), making
up one full sentence.
2. The underlying structure of the RC and MC share a common
grammatical argument (CA).
3. The RC functions as syntactic modifier of the CA in the MC.
4. The RC has the basic structure of a clause, with a predicate and the
required nominal arguments (as well as peripheral arguments).
5. All core arguments in the RC are marked in the accusative case, just
as in all other subordinate clauses (except sequential ones).
In view of these characteristics, compare the following two sentences. The
first is a simple MC in the past tense; the second is the same MC but
modified by an RC:
(83)Ŋabiya noo tukak.
[ŋáb-i-a=nootuka-kᵃ]MCwear-PLUR-REAL=PST3feather- ACCHe used to wear a feather.
(84)Ŋabiya noo tukaa na buɗam.
[ŋáb-i-a=nootuka-a=[nabuɗám-∅]RC ]MCwear-PLUR-REAL=PST3feather- ACC=REL.SG black-REALHe used to wear a black feather (lit. ‘a feather which is black’).
The common argument (CA) shared between the MC and RC in (84) is tuka‘feather’. In the MC, the CA is an object marked in the accusative case, while497in the RC, it is the implied 3SG subject of the adjectival predicate buɗám-ón
‘to be black’. The RC modifies tuka- in the MC by specifying or restricting
the reference of that argument (i.e., it is no longer just any feather; it is a
feather which is black).
Ik only has restrictive relative clauses, the kind illustrated in (84) above. As
such, they can only provide information about the CA that helps restrict its
reference to an individual entity. Non-restrictive relative clauses that simply
provide more information about an already known CA are not grammatical
in the language. In the situation where a proper noun is modified by an RC
in Ik, it implies that there are two or more people, places, or things with
that particular proper name. Compare the following examples:
(85)Atsaa ama na mita ncieebam.
[ats-á-áám-á=[namɪt-aɲci-ebám]RC ] MCcome- REAL-PRF person-NOM=REL.SG be-REAL I[OBL]-friend[OBL]
Here comes the guy that is my friend.
(86)Atsaa Lotuka na mita ncieebam.
[ats-á-álotuk-a=[namɪt-aɲci-ebám]RC ] MCcome- REAL-PRF Lotuk-NOM=REL.SG be-REAL I[OBL]-friend[OBL]
1) **Here comes Lotuk, who is my friend.
2) Here comes the (particular) Lotuk that is my friend.","[527, 528, 529]"
"175Take the compound in (69), for instance, where the noun dakú- ‘tree’ is used
as the modifying N1. Then compare the word order of the compound with
that of a normal noun phrase having the same meaning:
(69)Compound versus noun phrase
dakúMOD-ɓɔ́lHEADɓɔ́láHEADdakwíMODtree-shin:NOMshin:NOM tree:GEN‘tree trunk’‘trunk of the tree’As a third structural feature, compounds involve a special case marking: The
N1 takes the oblique case while the N2 takes whatever case the syntax
requires for the whole construction. In the oblique case, the form of the N1
is usually an exact representation of its underlying lexical form. An
exception to this statement is that a noun ending in a VV sequence will lose
its final vowel when joined to another noun in a compound. In the following
examples, the noun bubuu- ‘belly’ is compounded with aƙɔ́- ‘interior’.
Observe that the final vowel of bubuu- is lost and that only the case of the
N2, aƙɔ́-, changes with different clausal argument structures:
(70)Doda bubuaƙw.
dód-abubu-aƙw-ᵃhurt-REALbelly[OBL]-interior-NOM(My) inner belly hurts.
(71)Iya bubuaƙok.
i-ábubu-aƙɔ-kᵋbe-REALbelly[OBL]-interior-DAT‘It’s inside the belly.’
As a fourth structural feature, almost all Ik compounds are endocentric: The
N2 is always in the same grammatical category as the compound as a whole.
This is true of its word class (nominal) as well as its syntactic function. That
is, the morpho-syntactic function of the N2 in a compound is always the176same as that of the whole compound. The N1 , however, can be a pronoun,
noun, or a even a verb (in a special form), for example:
(72)Word class of compound N1
Pronounɲ́ci-ƙʊlɛ́‘my elbow’Nountsɔ́rá-ƙʊlɛ‘baboon’s elbow’Verbtakani-ƙʊlɛ́‘Appearing-Elbow (place name)’Two exceptional exocentric compounds are ámá-ze ‘big person (i.e. one in
charge)’ and roɓa-zeík ‘big people (ones in charge)’. The N2 of these
compounds is the verb ze- ‘be big’; the -ik in zeík is the adjectival plural
suffix (§7.10.5). These lexical compound are so rare it is believed they are
calques of the Teso-Turkana ‘positioner’ nouns ɛ́kápó lóni ̥ ‘big person’ and
ŋɪ́kápó lok ‘big people’ (e.g. in Dimmendaal 1983:274-276). The Ik calque of
ɛ́ká-pól-óni̥ ‘big person’ has another instantiation as ámá-ze-ám, a tri-nominal
compound with the structure PERSON- BIG- PERSON. This seems to be an even
more direct, structurally identical, calque of the Teso-Turkana equivalent.
As a fifth structural feature, each term in an Ik compound can be pluralized.
Semantics, though, may restrict which nouns this may apply to. For
example, there are no recorded examples of a plural N1 modifying a singular
N2. Otherwise, the first, second, or both compounded nouns are pluralized
with the same pluratives they have in non-compounded environments:
(73)Pluralization of compound nouns

Compounds also have special semantic properties. The combined meaning
of the two compounded elements is either 1) more specific or 2) completely
different than the meanings of the individual constituents. For example, the
compound icé-ám ‘Ik person’ narrows the reference of the compound head
ám ‘person’. And the fact that the compound faɗi-ɡur ‘bitter-heart’ refers to
a type of pungent grass species is not automatically known from the
meanings of the two component parts.
These semantic properties predispose Ik compounds to futher semantic
developments. For example, their ability to narrow the reference of the
compound head has lead to the (partial?) grammaticalization of imá- ‘child’
and wicé- ‘children’ into diminutive markers (§4.3.3), as well as the
grammaticalization of ámá- ‘person’ and icé- ‘Ik/people’ into agentive
markers (§4.3.4). And with a subset of compound heads, compounding has
also lead to several locative expressions used as general place names, to the
gender specification of birds and animals, and to whole-part relationships
including body parts and their semantic extension as relational nouns.
A limited subset of compound heads with locative meanings is used for
general place names. These nouns, like aƙɔ́- ‘interior’, awá- ‘home/place’,
and hoo- ‘hut’, function like postpositions or even incipient case markers
(indeed some Ik case markers may have arisen from compound heads or
postpositions; see §6.4). Examples include the following:
(74)Compound common place names
aŋarasá-áƙwᵃ‘gravelly area’(lit. ‘gravel-interior’)awá-áƙwᵃ‘compound/yard’(lit. ‘home-interior’)dzíɡw-awᵃ‘market’(lit. ‘commerce-home’)ɡirésí-awᵃ‘storage place’(lit. ‘storing-home’)wáána-ho‘church’(lit. ‘prayer-hut’)178Another subset of compound heads act to specify the gender of birds and
animals. These include words like cikó- ‘male’, ŋwaá- ‘female’, and others:
(75)Compound gender specifications
ɗiɗe-cúrúkᵃ‘male donkey’(lit. ‘donkey-bull’)ɗiɗe-ŋwa‘female donkey’(lit. ‘donkey-female’)ɗiɗe-waz‘young female donkey’(lit. ‘donkey-young fem.’)ŋókí-cikwᵃ‘male dog’(lit. ‘dog-male’)ŋókí-ŋwa‘female dog’(lit. ‘dog-female’)Single body part terms can be combined with other body part terms or other
nouns to create compounds with more specific anatomical references:
(76)Compound anatomical specifications
aká-kwáɛ̆ᵃ‘lip’(lit. ‘mouth-tooth’)dɛá-mórókᵃ‘ankle’(lit. ‘leg-throat’)ekú-sítsʼᵃ‘eyelash, eyebrow’(lit. ‘eye-hair’)ɡubesí-ɔ́kᵃ‘thighbone’(lit. ‘thigh-bone’)sea-mucé‘blood vessel’(lit. ‘blood-path’)Some body part terms are also used extensively in compounds as whole-part
locative expressions often called ‘relational nouns’ (e.g. in König 2002:7375). These relational nouns are dealt with further below in §4.3.8.
The ability of compounds to express meanings greater or different than that
of the sum of their parts has made possible 1) creative coinages for newlyencountered technologies, 2) the lexicalization of names for things like
plants and animals, and 3) colorful idiomaticization.
As a productive word-building strategy, compounding is often use to coin
new terms for new technology. For example, a tripod is called leweɲí-dɛ
‘ostrich-foot’ due to its three-pronged structure. A small vehicle is
colloquially called kae-im or ‘little tortoise’. And several modern tools like179pliers and prongs are given the colorful title tilokotsi-akᵃ ‘hornbill-beak’. In a
reverseprocess,sometimesnewlyborrowedwordsreplaceoldercompounds, for example ɲámákɛtᵃ ‘market’ in place of dzíɡw-awᵃ.
A fair number of plant and place names are made up of compounds. Though
these compounds have been lexicalized, presumably in the past they were
coinages with meanings referencing the meanings of each of the two
compounded elements. Some examples include:
(77)(78)Compound plant names
bɛfá-cɛ́mɛ́r‘Cissus rhodesiae’(lit. ‘puff adder-herb’)ɗiɗe-ŋam‘sorghum var.’(lit. ‘donkey-sorghum’)faɗi-ɡur‘Fadigura’(lit. ‘bitter-heart’)ɡasara-kwatsᵃ‘Plectranthus sp.’(lit. ‘buffalo-urine’)kʊlaɓá-kákᵃ‘Fuerstia africana’(lit. ‘bushbuck-leaf’)Compound place names

repeatedly used in creative, colorful ways. Here are a few examples:

The nouns imá- ‘child’ and wicé- ‘children’ may convey the notion of
diminutiveness when acting as the head (N2) of a compound. But the degree
to which these nouns have been grammaticalized as diminutive suffixes is
difficult to ascertain. They can have both a grammaticalized diminutive
sense, as in ŋókí-im ‘puppy (dog-child)’ or a normal lexical sense, as in ɛdɛ́im ‘my brother’s child’—not ‘my little brother’. Examples of the semigrammaticalized usage of these suffixes include the following:

been lexicalized as names for types of people or spirits, for example:181(82)Diminutive animate beings

Like the diminutive, the agentive compound involves a pair of lexical nouns
that seem to be on the way to being grammaticalized as agentive suffixes.
These are ámá- ‘person’ for singular and icé- ‘Ik’ for plural. As an analogy
with the diminutive, one might expect the plural agentive to be the lexical
plural of ‘person’, which is roɓa- ‘people’, but it is not. That icé- is also the
Ik’s name for themselves suggests that it may have once had a more general
meaning like ‘people’. Heine has made the plausible suggestion that the
agentive icé- is derived from the diminutive wicé- (Heine & König 1996:20).
While in Dime and Sheko, both Omotic languages not so far from Ik, the
agentive is derived from a form of the word for ‘father’ (Mulugeta 2008:59).
‘Agentive’ is used here in a broad sense, not just for the semantic role of
‘agent’ but for anyone characterized by the reference of the N1. The
equivalent of the Ik agentive in Turkana is called a ‘positioner noun’ and is
divided up into such categories as ‘agentive’, ‘processor’, and ‘essive’
(Dimmendaal 1983:274), but this is not done here. In its most basic
conception, the Ik agentive means ‘the X person’ or ‘the X-people’. It can
also be translated as ‘the person/people who X’ or ‘X-er(s)’, depending on
the compound’s N1, which can be a noun or a nominalized verb. So the
agentive, broadly defined, covers a range of nuances like 1) a person doing
an action, 2) a person characterized by a state, 3) a person characterized by
a thing, and 4) a person belonging to a group, particularly an ethnic group.
The N1 of an agentive compound can be a noun or nominalized verb. The
following are examples of agentives with nouns as the N1:182(83)Agentives with a nominal N1
SingularPluralcooka-ama-cooka-icé‘shepherd(s)’dɛá-áma-dɛá-ícé-‘messenger(s)’dzú-áma-dzú-íce-‘thief(ves)’ɛ́sá-ama-ɛ́sá-ice-‘drunkard(s)’ƙaƙa-ama-ƙaƙa-icé-‘hunter(s)’tɔkɔba-ama-tɔkɔba-icé-‘farmer(s)’But in the majority of agentive compounds, the N1 is a nominalized verb,
either transitive or intransitive. In principle, there is no restriction on the
number of affixes found on such N1 verbs. For many deverbal agentives, the
best English translation usually involves the suffix -er(s):

translation into English often involves adjective modifiers e.g.:

Compounds are also made with pronouns serving as N1, N2, or both. These
pronominal compounds include the personal possessive (§5.1.2), the
emphatic (§5.1.3), and the impersonal possessum (§5.2):
(86)Pronominal compounds

The internal plurative -aʝɪ́ká- is a complex compound N2 composed of the
unknown root aʝ- and the plurative III {-ɪka-}. Because of its function as a
plurative, a tempting analysis is to treat it as a suffix. However, because a) it
does not delete the stem-final vowel, and b) it does not change the stem
tone melody, it must be viewed as the N2 of a compound construction.
The internal plurative expresses the meaning ‘the interior of more than one
X’. The root aʝ- has not been identified as an independent noun. But both
form and meaning suggest a connection with the noun aƙɔ́- ‘inside/interior’,
which when pluralized (aƙwɪ́nɪ́-) and used in compounds, has a similar184meaning as the internal plurative. The internal plurative is not often used,
but three examples of it are given below:
(87)Internal plurative compounds
PluralInternal Pl.áw-íkᵃ‘homes’→áw-íka-aʝɪ ́ká-‘in/among homes’ríʝ-íkᵃ‘forests’→ríʝ-íka-aʝɪ ́ká-‘in/among forests’séd-ikᵃ‘gardens’→séd-ika-aʝɪ ́ká-‘in/among gardens’4.3.7 Variative plurative
The variative plurative -icíká- is also a complex N2 possibly composed of the
sequence -ic- and the plurative III {-ɪka-}. Like the internal plurative, it may
be tempting to view this N2 as a suffix instead, but it does not a) subtract
the stem-final vowel nor b) altern the stem tone melody. So for those
reasons, it is analyzed here as (semi-) grammaticalized N2.
The variative plurative expresses the meaning ‘kinds of X’ or ‘various X’.
Structurally, it seems to be either a) a reduplication of the plurative III
{-ɪka-} or b) a combination of the diminutive/agentive (w)icé- and the
plurative III {-ɪka-}. Regardless of it etymology, -icíká- is often used to
pluralize nouns not normally (re-)pluralizeable, for example 1) general
number nouns, 2) nouns not pluralizeable with any other plurative, 3)
inherently plural nouns, 4) nominalized verbs, 5) and pluralized nouns.

A number of Ik body-part terms are used in whole-part expressions as
‘relational’ nouns (König 2002:73-75). These nouns are found in two
morpho-syntactic positions: 1) as the N 2 of a compound (hence their being
treated in this section on compounds) and 2) as a noun phrase head with a)
the possessive singulative and b) a genitive modifier (which may be
implied). Though synchronically they still function as full nouns (that can
take any of the eight morphological cases), the relational nouns exhibit a
very ‘preposition-like’ function, particularly as the noun phrase head. The
following two tables compare singular and plural relational nouns:

lexical meaning has been recovered. It has been lexicalized in the term didiɡwarí ‘weather-top’, an important cultural concept meaning ‘sky, heaven’ or
‘God’. And the only known possible lexical meaning for the commonly used
relational noun aƙɔ́- ‘inside’ comes from Gumuz word -(á)kʼw(á) ‘head’.
In principle, the terms listed in (94) are productive, but in practice, many of
them have set up into lexicalized expressions like the following. Herein lies
the main source—apart from borrowing—of Ik lexical nominal enrichment:

For
example, Ik kinship relations are patrilocal: New wives are brought in from
outside a man’s clan to his parents’ home area. They are also patrilineal: All
one’s relatives are understood in relation to one’s father and paternal uncles.
For instance, the term abáŋi- meaning ‘my father’ applies not only to one’s
birth father but also to any of the his brothers. So one may essentially have
more than one ‘father’. But the brother of one’s birth mother is referred to
as momóo- or ‘uncle’ rather than ‘father’.
A second feature of the Ik kinship terminology is that it is based on
reference to person (i.e. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person). The term needed to refer to
a particular relative depends on whether it is the relative of the speaker, the
addressee, or a third-person non-speech-act participant. For example, if the
speaker names her father, she will call him abáŋ ‘my father’, but if she
names her addressee’s father, she will say bábo ‘your father’. And if she
refers to someone else’s father, she will say babatᵃ ‘his/her father’.
Morphologically, Ik kinship terms exhibit a couple of notable features. First,
many of them are made up of compounds. They may join two nouns, as in
momó-cekᵃ ‘maternal aunt (lit. ‘uncle-wife’)’ or totó-im ‘maternal cousin (lit.
‘maternal aunt’s child’)’. Others may join a pronoun and a noun, as in ŋɡóím ‘younger sibling (lit. ‘our child’)’ or bi-emetá ‘your in-law’. Secondly, in
the Ik person-based kinship reference system, one can find traces of archaic
person-marking morphology that has been completely lost in the rest of the
grammar. Compare the following forms:
(96)Archaic possessive suffixes on kinship terms
Person‘father’‘mother’‘grandmother’1SGabáŋi-yáŋi-dadáŋi-2SGbáboo-ŋóo-dádoo-3SGbabatí-ŋwaatí-dadatí-189That the forms in (96) retain old possessive suffixes is most clearly seen in
the words for ‘father’ and ‘grandmother’. These suffixes are *-áŋi- for first
person, *-(o)o- for second, and *-atí- for third person (which may come from
an old singulative; see (28) above)—all singular. With this in mind, these
kinship terms can be re-analyzed as follows in order to highlight their
historical morphology (which has now been lexicalized):
(97)Archaic possessive suffixes in analysis
Person‘father’‘mother’‘grandmother’1SG(*b)ab-áŋi-y-áŋi-dad-áŋi-2SGbáb-oo-ŋó-o-dád-oo-3SGbab-atí-ŋw-aatí-dad-atí-The old root *bab, meaning ‘father’, presumably lost its initial /b/ in the
first-person reference at some point in time. In the case of ‘mother’, it seems
that based on the second and third-person reference, the old root is *ŋo. For
second person, the possessive suffix -(o)o- is shortened, possibly due to Ik’s
dislike for sequences of three vowels. And for third person, the root
desyllabifies and causes compensatory lengthening on the suffix. When it
comes to the first person, it is not clear how *ŋo could be related to *y.
The old possessive prefixes shown in (96) are found elsewhere in the kinship
terminology but in an even more eroded form. Often the second and thirdperson suffixes are the only ones remaining:
(98)Archaic possessive suffixes on other kinship terms
Person‘brother’‘sister’‘grandfather’1SG(ɛdɛ́ɛ-)ye-áa-bob-áa-2SGlé-ó-yá-óo-bób-oo3SGle-atíye-atíbob-atí-190Before the loss of lateral fricatives in Ik, the root for ‘brother’ used to be *ɬɪ(Heine & König 1996:17). And if there ever was a proto-form *le-áŋi- for ‘my
brother’, it has been replaced by the unrelated ɛdɛ́ɛ-. Elsewhere in (98), the
first-person suffix -áŋi- has lost its velar nasal, giving rise to the variant -áa.
The following table presents a set of kinship terms including the ones shown
in (96) and (98). These terms are from the point of view of Ego or ‘I’—that
is, the first person. Second and third-person forms can be extrapolated from
these. Moreover, they are all listed in the lexicon in Appendix B. To change
person, either the archaic (frozen) possessive suffixes can be changed (as
when going from bobá ‘my grandfather’ to bóbo ‘your grandfather’) or the N1
pronouns in compounds (as in ɲ́ ci-cekᵃ ‘my wife’ to ntsí-cékᵃ ‘his wife’). The
literal meaning of compounded terms is also given when known:

"3917.9.3 Impersonal passive
The suffix {-anɪ ́-} acts as the marker of an ‘impersonal passive’ construction.
At first glance, {-anɪ ́-} seems to be related to the ‘stative’ suffix {-án+-}
(§7.10.3). This superficial resemblence led to {-anɪ ́-} being analyzed as
stative as well (Serzisko 1992:202). But the two suffixes differ crucially in
their underlying tones and [ATR] values and thus cannot easily be linked.
The impersonal passive {-anɪ ́-} is an opaque recessive suffix that blocks
[+ATR] harmony spread from a dominant stem. Its tone is LH, but that can
change in the tonal environment of the stem, as seen in examples below.
The construction marked by {-anɪ ́-} is called ‘passive’ because it
syntactically omits any subject (A/S), leaving it to be inferred pragmatically.
And it is called ‘impersonal’ because a verb with {-anɪ ́-} invariably has 3SG
zero-marking, regardless of the person and number of any implied subject.
The impersonal passive can occur with transitive or intransitive verbs. With
transitive verbs, the A is omitted, and the O is promoted to S only in terms
of surface grammatical relations (marked by case suffixes). That is, the
subject of an impersonal passive verb is marked with the NOM case in main
clauses. This contrasts it with the So ‘impersonal’ (Carlin 1993:85), the
Toposa ‘passive’ (Schröder 2008:59), and the Turkana ‘impersonal active’
(Dimmendaal 1983:72)—all of which retain object-marking for the patient.
However, in most types of subordinate clauses, the patient of an Ik
impersonal passive is also encoded as the object (O). So there is a mismatch
in alignment between main and subordinate clauses. This seems to indicate
transitional forms—the impersonal passive/active being a Kuliak calque
from Teso-Turkana (or earlier) that is now being reanalyzed in Ik due to a
prohibition against marked objects without subjects in main clauses.
The examples below illustrate these properites of the impersonal passive.
First, in (207), presents a normal impersonal passive construction: No agent392is encoded (except an impersonal one), and the patient is encoded as an S in
the NOM case. Then in (208), an ungrammatical clause shows that nothing
but an impersonal subject can be marked on the impersonal passive verb:
(207)Inomesana bi.
ɪnɔ́m-ɛ́s-an-abi-∅beat-INT-IPS-REALyou.sg-NOMYou will be beaten (Lit. ‘It will be beaten you.’).
(208)**Inomesanida bi.
**ɪnɔ́m-ɛ́s-án-ɪ ́d-abi-∅**beat-INT-IPS-2SG -REAL you.SG-NOM
**You will be beaten.
Second, the sentence in (209) shows an impersonal passive construction as a
subordinate clause acting as the complement to the verbless copulative ntsúó
‘It is...’. Note that the patient now receives double object-marking: 1) It is
postverbal, whereas most subordinate clause subjects are preverbal, and 2)
it has the ACC case. Then compare it with (210), where the patient is cast as
the subject of the impersonal passive verb—the result is ungrammatical:
(209)Ntsuo inomanee bik.
ntsú-ó [ɪnɔ́m-án-é=e

(210)**Ntsuo bia inomanad.
**ntsú-ó[bi-aɪnɔ́m-án-á=dᵉ]CC**it-COPyou.SG-ACCbeat-IPS-REAL=DP**That’s why you are beaten.
Semantically, it can be said that in impersonal passive clauses, the point is
not ‘who did what’ but only that something got done. This would help393explain why the impersonal passive is also used with intransitive verbs. The
point is to be as indirect as possible about the agents/people involved and
focus only on the fact that something has taken place. The following three
examples are fairly common sayings heard among speakers in daily social
interaction. The impersonal passive construction serves the Ik well in their
proclivity to be curious and inquiring without being direct and rude:
(211)Atsana awoo?
ats-an-aawó-ocome-IPS-REALhome-ABLAre you coming from home (lit. ‘Is it come from home’)?

(213)Epesana ndaik?

And finally, a few examples from other natural discourse contexts:

s/he-ACC3947.9.4 Sequential impersonal passive
The suffix {-ɛsɛˊ} is the morphological marker of the ‘sequential impersonal
passive’. Absolutely no etymological parallels for this suffix have been
found. This suffix is recessively [-ATR], having /-ese/ as an allomorph on
[+ATR] verbs stems. Before a pause, {-ɛsɛˊ} is reduced to /-ɛs/ or /-es/. Its
underlying tone is LL(H), the floating H tone being posited on the basis of
the H tone it places on a following L-tone-bearing unit. Its own tone melody
can change, for example to HL on stems ending in H (T7) or LH before the
dummy pronoun {=ˊdɛ}, as in ats-esé=dᵉ ‘And people came from there.’
In terms of meaning and function, the sequential impersonal passive (SPS) is
a marriage between the sequential aspect and the impersonal passive
described in the previous section. It does for the sequential aspect what the
impersonal passive does for every other non-sequential clause type. Briefly,
it eliminates any subject (A/S) and promotes any object (O) to subject (S).
One might say that the SPS takes impersonalness a step further than the
impersonal passive in that its morpheme (-ɛsɛˊ) is so suppletive in contains
no 3SG marker—nor any subject-marker at all. It is an agentless passive par
excellence, having neither a syntactic nor morphologically encoded agent.
The SPS differs from the impersonal passive in one other way: Even in
subordinate clauses where the patient assumes an object’s postverbal
syntactic slot, the case-marking on that argument remains NOM, for example:
(216)Na enuƙweese bi, ceiƙweese bi.
na=en-úƙó-esébi-∅cɛ-ɪ ́ƙɔ́-ɛsɛ́bi-∅CONJ =see-AND-SPSyou.SG- NOMkill-COMP-SPSyou.SG- NOMWhen you are seen, you are killed.
Like the impersonal passive, the SPS also occurs with intransitive verbs, e.g.:395(217)Ƙeese waa loɗiwei.
ƙe-ese wa-alóɗíwéí-∅go-SPS harvest-NOMplant.sp-GENAnd then one goes to harvest the Maerua angolensis plant.
As part of the sequential aspect paradigm, the SPS is used in long strings of
discursively (co-)subordinate clauses such as the following:
(218)Itsuŋƙweese riʝika tokobimak.
ɪtsʊ́ŋ-ƙɔ-ɛsɛríʝ-ík-aburn-COMP-SPS forest-PL-NOMtɔkɔ́b-ɪma-kᵒˊ

The sequential impersonal passive cannot be negated in and of itself. If a
clause with the SPS needs to be negated, the sequential aspect negator moo is
employed with the second (negated) verb in the impersonal passive voice.
To illustrate this, (219) presents an affirmative sequential impersonal
passive sentence, followed by its negative version in (220):396(219)Honetiakoo ragw, ceiƙweesed.

"9.12.2 Content questions
Content questions in Ik involve clauses in which a constituent has been
replaced with an interrogative word. Unlike in some languages, only one
interrogative word per question is permitted in Ik. Ik Interrogative words—
see (179) below—include those corresponding to (and therefore standing in
place of) (pro)nouns, adverbs, and verbs. Besides the interrogative words
themselves, no other special morphological or intonational means are used.",[561]
"10.2 Clause chaining
Clause chaining is the linchpin of Ik discourse. As defined here, it is the
linking of one or more clauses with non-finite verbs to a clause with a finite
verb. The syntactic relationship between the initial or controlling clause and
the chained clauses is the subject of debate; some describe it as ‘quasicoordinate’ (Haiman & Monroe 1983:xii) and others as ‘co-subordination’
(Van Valin & LaPolla 1997:455). It is not clearly coordinative or
subordinative and thus may be considered a hybrid of the two (Schröder
2013a:2). In Ik, chained sequential clauses are more coordinative, while
chained simultaneous clauses seem more subordinative.
In many languages, particularly outside of Africa but also in Ethiopia, a
clause chain begins with a sequence of non-finite clauses culminating in a
final clause that bears the TAM specifications of the whole chain. But in Ik,
as in neighboring Teso-Turkana languages like Toposa, the clause chain
begins with the controlling finite clause and is then followed by one or more
non-finite clauses (Schröder 2013b:5). This ‘post-nuclear’ orientation of the
clause chain is well-attested in Africa but rarer elsewhere (Payne 1997:321)
Ik exhibits two kinds of chained clause: sequential and simultaneous. The
markers or indicators of these clauses are the verbal inflectors that bear the
same labels (§7.8.1 for sequential, §7.8.2 for simultaneous). As the label564implies, sequential clauses in a clause chain carry the sequence of mainline
or foregrounded information in any kind of text with sequential events.
Simultaneous clauses, on the other hand, convey offline contextual
circumstances that cooccur with events or states in clauses preceding them.
The initial, controlling element that creates the TAM setting for a clause
chain may consist of any non-chained verb or even an adverbial phrase.","[595, 596]"
"283Going a step further, when a transitive verb is made into a causative, the
subject (A) of the original verb is treated as an object (O) of the nowcausative verb. But, the object (O) of the original verb is now treated as a
second object or extension (E) in the now causative construction. The data
below shows what happens when the transitive verb wet- ‘drink’, which
requires an agent (A) and a patient (O), is causativized:
(157)Wetuo ima cemerik.
wet-u-oim-aAcɛmɛrɪ-kᵃOdrink-3SG-SEQchild-NOMherb-ACCAnd the child drank the medicine.
(158)Wetituƙotuo imaa cemerik.
wet-it-úƙót-u-oimá-áOcɛmɛrɪ-kᵋEdrink-CAUS- COMP-3SG-SEQchild-ACCherb-DATAnd she made the child take the medicine.
In (157)-(158), the subject (A) of the first clause (im ‘child’) becomes the
patient (O) in the second, now causative clause. And the patient (O) of the
first clause (cɛmɛr ‘herb’) becomes a second or extended object (E) in the
second clause. So in a sense, through a metaphorical extension of the
Location role, the extended object becomes the ‘site’ of the causation.
As a side topic, it is worth mentioning that the Ik verb iryám-ét-oni- ‘to get’
(cf. Teso-Turkana a-ryam-un) always takes an argument in the dative case:
(159)Iryameida bee ŋitsanie?
iryam-é-íd-a=beeŋɪ ́tsanɪ ́-ɛget-VEN-2SG- REAL=PST2 troubles-DAT
Did you get trouble yesterday?
At first glance, it would appear that this is an instance where a core
argument is marked with the dative, a non-core-marking case. However, it284is more likely that despite the English translation of this verb as ‘get’, it is
really an intransitive verb, making the object in fact a peripheral argument.
A clue for this comes from Teso-Turkana, where a-ryam-un ‘to get’ is related
to aki-ryam-un ‘to meet with’. As such, this Ik verb may carry more the idea
of ‘meeting with sth.’ (e.g. ‘acquiring’) as opposed to merely ‘getting’ it.
Finally, on the basis of example (160) below, König has claimed that the
verb form bɪra-e shows a ‘petrified’ form of the dative case on the verb bɪrá‘not there’. She analyzes this verb form as bɪra-DAT and suggests that it has
been lexicalized into a ‘preposition’ meaning ‘without’ (2002:255):
(160)…ɠo-í-akakum-eɛdábɪ ́ra-eíŋar-esí-kᵃgo-1SG-aKakuma-DATalonebe.NEG-DAT help-INF-ACCI went alone to Kakuma without any help.
But this analysis is flawed due to incorrect morphological parsing. The verb
form in question is not bɪra-e analyzed as bɪra-DAT but rather bɪrá-ɪ́-ɛ
analyzed as bɪrá-3SG-SIML. This form is not a noun or verb fossilized into a
preposition but rather an instance of the impersonal, 3SG adverbial
simultaneous verbs used in clause chains (§11.2.2). It is true that this verb
form is often best translated as ‘without’ into English, but it does not follow
that it has become a ‘preposition’. The example sentence in (160), taken
from König (2002:255) is reanalyzed and glossed here as follows:
(161)Ƙoyaa Kakumee eɗa, birayee iŋaaresik.
ƙó-ia-akákumé-égo-1SG-SEQ Kakuma-DATɛɗábɪrá-ɪ ́-ɛɪŋaar-ɛ́sɪ ́-kᵃalonelack-3SG-SIMLhelp-INF -ACCI went to Kakuma alone without (lit. ‘it lacking’) any help.","[314, 315, 316]"
"4.2NumberGrammatical number is reflected in the Ik nominal system in three ways.
First, the base form of nouns is lexically specified for one of three numeric
values: 1) singular, 2) plural, or 3) general (number neutral). Second, based
on a noun’s lexically specified numeric value, the grammar requires number
agreement on relative pronouns, demonstratives, and subject-agreement on
verbs (except for 3PL in relative clauses). Third, number may be marked on
nouns through a system of singulative and plurative inflectors. In Ik, as in
Turkana (Dimmendaal 1983:223), the selection of some pluratives depends
on the noun’s mora count rather than on semantics or any other factor.
Since the lexically assigned numeric value of a noun cannot necessarily be
guessed on semantic grounds, number agreement provides the needed clues.
For example, in (37) below, the non-past demonstrative clitics {=na} ‘this’
and {=ni} ‘these’ can reveal a number-neutral noun’s numeric value:
(37)Singular:ámá- ‘person’ámá=na‘this person’**ámá=ni‘these persons’153Plural:General:roɓa- ‘people’ínó- ‘animal’roɓa=ni‘these people’**roɓa=na‘this people’ínwá=na‘this animal’ínwá=ni‘these animals’Numeric values like the ones evident in (37) are not always obligatorily
marked in the nominal system. Number is commonly marked inflectionally
with singulatives or pluratives or grammatically with relative pronouns,
demonstratives, and subject-agreement, but it is still optional. For example,
without modifiers of any kind, the object rié- ‘goat’ in (38) has two
interpretations with regard to its grammatical number:
(38)Toŋolata naa riyek.
tɔŋɔ́l-át-a=naarié-kᵃslaughter-3PL-REAL=PST 1goat-ACCa) They slaughtered a goat.
b) They slaughtered goats.
If the noun in question is the subject, its number is marked with subjectagreement suffixes (3SG being null), but this type of marking is defective.
For example, in unmarked main clauses, where the verb comes before the
subject, both 3SG and 3PL overt subjects are marked as 3SG (null) on the
verb. This is true whether grammatical number is encoded generally (39) or
with a plurative suffix (40):
(39)Bwaanuƙotaa inw.
buan-uƙot-á-áínw-ᵃdisappear- COMP[3SG]-REAL-PRFanimal(s)-NOMa) The animal has disappeared.
b) The animals have disappeared.","[184, 185]"
"9.13.1 Complement clauses
Complementclauses(COC L)inIkarerecognizedbytheinitialcomplementizer toimɛna- that introduces them. This complementizer is a
lexicalization of two roots: tódˋ- ‘speak’ and mɛná- ‘words, issues’, resulting
in a compound that means something akin to ‘saying (that)…’. Despite its
verblike meaning, toimɛna- behaves grammatically as a noun: a) It fills an
argument slot in the matrix clause, and b) it inflects for case.
Ik complement clauses evolved out of reported speech constructions (see
§9.14). Technically, it is the quotative complementizer toimɛna- ‘saying’ that
functions as the core argument of a matrix clause, while the ‘complement
clause’ itself is treated as a direct quotation, i.e. the complement of toimɛna-.
So point #2 of (193) is only true insofar as one considers the whole
construction to be grammaticalized such that toimɛna- plus the direct
quotation fill the argument slot of the matrix clause.
In terms of functional possibilities, toimɛna-clauses can fill the syntactic slots
for object (O), copula subject (CS), copula complement (CC), and oblique
peripheral argument. In (194), the complementizer toimɛna- is in the536accusative case, indicating that it and the clause it complementizes is the
object (O) of the transitive verb ɦye- ‘know’ in 3SG:
(194)Nta ɦyei toimenaa sitsʼa noo tatatieakwa nti.
ńtá ɦye-itátáti-e̯akw-a ńtí]CoCl]O[toimɛna-a [sítsʼ-á=noonot know-3SG COMPL-ACC engage-REAL=PST3 aunt-man-NOM ADV
He doesn’t know that (his) uncle got engaged like that.
In the next example, a toimɛna-clause is functioning as the copula subject
(CS) of a verbless clause. The copula complement (CC) of the verbless clause
is ntsí- ‘it’ which appears as ntsú-ó ‘it is…’ in the copulative case:
(195)Ntsuo toimena tezetoo menaicika muɲ.
ntsú-ó [toimɛn-a
it-COPCOMPL-NOM[tɛ́z-ɛt-ɔ-ɔmɛná-ícík-ámuɲᵘ]CoCl]CSend-INCH-3SG- SEQissues-PL-NOMallIt’s that all the issues have ended.
The next example features a complement clause functioning as the copula
complement (CC) of the negative copula verb bení-. With this verb, CCs
typically take the copulative case, and this sentence is no exception:
(196)Benia toimenoo mitida ceki na gaan.
beni-a[toimɛnɔ-ɔ [mɪt-ɪ ́d-aceki=náɡaan-∅] CoCl]CCnot.be-REAL COMPL-COP be-2SG-REAL woman[OBL]=REL.SG bad-REAL
It’s not that you are a bad woman.
In the next example, the complement clause is treated morphologically
(with the oblique case suffix) and syntactically (noun in a series following
ńda) as a peripheral argument. The origin of toimɛna- as an introducer of
reported speech comes out clearly in this example: a) An audience for the
reported speech is encoded as the extended object cɪkámée ‘to the women’
which even separates the complementizer from the quotation, and b) the
quotative particle taa, otherwised used in quotative formulae, is present:537(196)Nda toimena cikamee taa ƙoyuo koto sedikak.
ńda [toimɛnacɪkámé-etaa [ƙó-yúo=kotoséd-ika-kᵉ]CoCl]OBLand COMPL[OBL] women-DAT QUOT go-IMP.PL=then garden-PL-DAT
And saying to the women that ‘you go then to the gardens’.
Because toimɛna-clauses can express either factual or potential propositions,
they exhibit a wide range of possible verb and clause types. With some
verbs, like bɛ́ɗ- ‘want’, even hortatives and optatives can occur:
(197)Beɗa toimenaa taa goƙaaketano.
bɛ́ɗ-á[toimɛna-a taa[ɡoƙ-aak-ét-ano]CoCl]Owant-REALCOMPL-ACCseated-DISTR-VEN-HORTQUOTHe wants us to all be seated (lit. ‘He wants that let’s all be seated’).
(198)Beɗida toimena yumetine ceki?

As seen in (196) and (197), the quotative particle taa (a phonologically
reduced form of kʊta ‘s/he says’) often accompanies toimɛna-. This particle
functions as an optional introducer of reported speech (see §9.14). The Ik
‘saying’-words toimɛna- and taa can be compared to similar forms in
neighboring Teso-Turkana languages. For example, in Karimojong, the
complementizer a-tɛmar is also the verb ‘to say’ and the quotative particle
ɛbɛ́ is an irregular 3SG form of the verb ábala, also meaning ‘to say’.
Lastly, complement clauses are negated just like non-complement clauses:
(199)Nesibia toimena nta zeƙwidi atik.
nesíb-i-a[toimɛn-a[ńt-ázɛƙw-ɪ ́dɪátí-kᵉ]CoCl]Ohear-1SG-REALCOMPL-NOMnot-REALlive-2SGFILL-DATI hear that you don’t live in, um…","[567, 568, 569]"
"Aninterrogative copula with the form -ko is also found in the Southern Cushitic
languages Alagwa and Burunge (Mous 2012:398). Suggesting a link with the
Ik copulative’s focalizing function, Eastern Cushitic’s Dhaasanac has an
enclitic =u called a ‘nominal focus marker’ (Tosco 2001:60, 268-269).
The copulative case suffix is L-toned but can take a H tone from a preceding
stem (T7). It is a recessive suffix that harmonizes to /-ko/ after a [+ATR]
stem. The copulative does not delete stem-final vowels but rather affixes
directly to them. Before a pause, the it is devoiced to /-kᵓ/, /-kᵒ/ or /-k̚/.
When the it attaches to a stem-final /i/, the /i/ is backed to /u/ in partial
assimilation to the vowel in the case suffix. And if the stem-final vowel is /ɪ/
or /a/, it may be partially or totally assimilated by the case suffix. Lastly, if
a stem ends in a high back vowel (/ʊ/ or /u/), that vowel may desyllabify,
causing the non-final copulative suffix to lengthen in compensation.

(163)Copulative case grammatical functions
1Mark focus in a cleft construction2Mark the complement of a verbless copula3Mark the complement of a negative identity copulaThe first function of the copulative is to mark an argument that has been
brought into discursive focus by being fronted before the main verb. The
result is a cleft-construction that means something like ‘It is X (that)...’. The
fronted constituent can be a subject, object, or any peripheral argument:

The second function of the copulative is to mark nouns functioning as the
complements of verbless copula clauses (VCC). VCCs provide an example of
when a noun non-canonically functions as a clause’s predicate. The
copulative case makes this possible by verbalizing the noun. No
corresponding subject is needed, though it may be inferred contextually:287(167)Amak.","[317, 318, 319]"
