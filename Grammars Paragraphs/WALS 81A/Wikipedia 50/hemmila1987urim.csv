"4.7. Typological Considerations
In summary, some clear tendencies can be seen. First, SVO word order occurs in all clause types.
Urim is a very consistent and rigid SVO-language. In particular, the position of subject is very fixed.
In most clause types it cannot be moved after the verb or anywhere else. In certain intransitive
clauses this is possible, but not very common. Also the position of locative object and topic is quite
rigid. In transitive clauses the second argument, object, is easily fronted for thematic reasons. There
is not so much danger of mixing the grammatical functions of subject and object in transitive clause,
because the transitive subject always is the more animate and agent-like referent in the clause. As
we have seen, the transitive subject is almost exclusively agent, and if not, this is shown by the
structure of the clause.
Typologically it is a common phenomenon that rigid word order and lack of morphological case
markings occur together in a language. This is especially common in SVO-languages like Urim.
Urim does not have any case marking morphology on either the subject or object, nor is there any
agreement marked on the verb either. Since there is no morphological way to mark which noun
phrase in the clause is subject and which is object, the syntactic position of the noun phrase before or
after the verb is what shows its syntactic function. Not only the subject and transitive object are
unmarked, but also all other obligatory arguments of a verb are morphologically unmarked. This
increases the importance of word order for delineating the functions of NPs in the clause. The
following examples illustrate how a change of word order changes the meaning of clauses and even
the clause type:
(25a)Kupm

(26b)Melnumalm -pel(experience clause)
nikg170
manhit.R-3sg.Ostomach‘The man hit him in the stomach.’(transitive clause)Urim has been classified as a Papuan language, stock level isolate in the Torricelli Phylum.. The
question of isolation can be re-considered when some of the neighbouring languages have been
studied in more detail. All Torricelli languages display some similarities with Austronesian
languages: fixed SVO word order, lack of medial verbs, use of transitivity-changing suffixes and
realis-irrealis mood, etc. It seems that Urim has these non-Papuan features to a greater extent than
many other Torricelli languages. It lacks subject-agreement on the verb, and is also in other respects
morphologically simpler than the other Torricelli phylum languages.
Torricelli phylum languages have been thought to be basically Papuan languages which have been
subjected to heavy Austronesian influence. There are some Austronesian languages along the north
coast. Word order is one of the Austronesian features in the Torricelli language group, since Papuan
languages usually are SOV- languages. It is a common theory that SVO- languages often have
developed from earlier SOV-languages either through the influence of some neighbouring SOVlanguages or from language internal reasons. One of these reasons could be the disappearance of
morphological case-marking, which in a way forces the language to rely on the word order in marking
these functions. (Givón 1979a 145-146). If a language were to change its word order from SOV to
SVO, it would be expected that there would be some residues from the former SOV-type structure.
The more recent this change has been, the more residues would be expected. Word order change
most commonly starts from the main-clause level, and later spreads into more complex structures.
According to Givón (1984:220-228). “the longer a language has maintained a rigid OV or VO word
order, the more it is likely to bear out Greenberg’s predictions (1966).” If this is true, then Urim has
been SVO-language at least during the last two thousand years, since it is an unusually pure SVOlanguage following all the predictions that Greenberg mentions. All modifiers of the noun phrase and
almost the entire verb phrase occur after the head. There are suffixes, but this is quite a common
feature in SVO-languages in general, and not a strong indicator of a recent change of word order.
Most commonly the residue of the presumed word order would occur in dependent and embedded
clauses and other structures like nominalizations and idioms. But in Urim these have SVO-word
order, except when the subject referent is generic:
(27)Kil
ariwe
hapm
3sg
know.R cloth
‘She knows how to sew.’angkut.
sew.RThis is the only observed possible residue of a former SOV-word order. Assuming this theory is
right Urim is an almost ideal SVO-language typologically. One could perhaps question if it were
easier to derive a language like Urim from an Austronesian group having some heavy Papuan171
influences than the other way around? But this and the whole question of the classification of Urim
needs much more work before any definite answers or even suggestions can be given.","[169, 170, 171]"
"Possessive ClauseIn the possessive clause the semantic possessor occurs in topic position and the possessed item
occurs as grammatical subject. This is thematically consistent with the normal ordering of
information in the clause, since the referent of the possessor is usually given information, and the
thing possessed is new information. Since there is no agreement morphology on the verb to show
which NP is the grammatical subject, only word order and semantic content reveal it. The word order
seems to be fixed; the topic and the subject cannot change places in the clause. One example was
found where the subject appeared to occur between the two parts of an appositional topic noun phrase
(23e). The possessor is usually animate, and most often human. Possessive clause may have a verb
denoting the position of the possessed object. There are both verbal and verbless possessive clauses,
but positive possessive clauses are more frequently verbal. The verb seems to be obligatory if there
is another nominal constituent in the clause. Possessive clauses structurally resemble three other
clause types: equative clauses (23b), existence clauses (23e) and locative clauses (23a).

"6. About Urim Discourse
6.1. Word Order Variations and Dislocations
Word order in Urim is basically very rigid. Since there are hardly any morphological means to
distinguish core arguments like Subject, Object, Locative Object and Second Object, they are solely
marked by their position. For this reason the core constituents cannot move very freely in the clause
for thematic reasons. Subjects almost always occur before the verb in Urim clause. Objects can be
fronted, but this is still comparatively rare in Urim.
Dislocations and topic constructions instead are very common in Urim. In these constructions the
topicalized or emphasized constituent occurs separately in front of the actual sentence, which relates
to it in some way. In most cases the external topic corresponds to some NP constituent in the clause
in which the external topic has some function. In left dislocation there is a grammatical element in the243
clause (usually a pronoun), which refers to the same entity. In topic constructions this does not occur
(Shopen p. 355).","[242, 243]"

Urim seems to have no formal morphological devices to form lexical nouns from verbs or
adjectives. Both simple verbs and whole clauses can function as NPs without any overt change in their
morphological structure. Many lexemes freely function as both nouns and verbs, so that it is difficult
to tell which category is more basic. Others seem to be basically verbs but can function also as heads
of NPs.

comeBecause of the lack of morphological marking, it is often difficult to tell whether a construction is
part of a clause chain or a nominalization. One common feature to all nominalized verbs is that they
do not get irrealis mode.
Certain types of embedded clauses have also other formal features that separate them from normal
clauses:
a) reversed word order
Nominalized clauses can exhibit a reversed word order OV (instead of VO) when an object is present
but there is no surface subject in the embedded clause. Reversed word order also occurs in many
idioms and lexicalized expressions (e.f. won-huwen ‘inside-bury = forget’). It is especially nonreferential, generic objects, both nominal and clausal, that tend to occur before predicates in
embedded clauses. In following example an embedded clause functions both as the Subject and the
Object.

’She uses to sew all the time.’wang
timeThe parts of this construction are never pronounced or written as one word. Another feature is that
the verb in this construction never gets irrealis mode. When the clause functions as object of a
‘normal’ verb (that is, not one of those verbs taking clausal objects, that are described later in 7.2.2.) it
always ha reversed word order OV. Reason to this might be pragamtical; reversed word order
disambiquates embedded clauses from serials (see the last example above). When the clause
functions as subject, reversed word order is optional. Consider the following example:
Antokg waprekg al yampis wekg ata, pa
ti
make smoke
eat bean
two
only that
this
’Smoking and eating beans, so these two only are forbidden.’angklon.
forbiddenb) habitual-continuative marker -e
In Urim the habitual-continuative marker -e often occurs in nominalized clauses, although this is
not the primary function of this device. Primarily it serves to mark continuity and habituality. This
device is more commonly used in relative clauses and sometimes also in adverbial clauses (see the
sections 3.1.3.2 and 5.2). It seems to be used in all types of embedded clauses that are of locative
type:
kar
arpm -e
ari
paipm
car
sit.R-CNT see.R bad
‘It feels bad to travel in a car’
These two devices, word order OV and suffix -e, may occur in any kind of embedded clauses, but
are not obligatory.","[177, 178, 179, 180]"
"Experience clausesNP + NP + V (+Pron)T S V (O)About defining clause types
The following criteria have been used here to determine the basic clause types in Urim:
1) How many obligatory arguments does the verb have? This is the main criterion. The
presence or absence of a verb is often also used as the main criterion for dividing clauses
into types. While Urim has both verbal and nonverbal clause types, there are also some
minor types where the verb is optional or is deleted when negated. Therefore the presence
of the verb is only used as a secondary criterion in determining Urim basic clause types.
2) What are the syntactic functions (subject, object etc) and the semantic roles (agent,
patient etc) of the arguments of the verb?
3) Clause types may also have special syntactic features such as word order, negative
form, case morphology etc. These, along with the meaning of the clause, have been used
here only as secondary criteria in separating clause types.
The important notion of transitivity distinguishes the two most common basic clause types in any
language: intransitive and transitive clauses. There are degrees of transitivity in clauses, since the
notion of transitivity is a graded continuum (Givon 1984: 98, 152-157). In the prototypical, highly
transitive clause the subject referent is a volitional, controlling agent or a non-volitional cause/effector154
and the object is a concrete, result-registering effect or patient. Many objects are less than
prototypical
In Urim certain clause types have an intermediate degree of transitivity, and are therefore called
here semitransitive. Clearly transitive verb stems are not as common in Urim as in many other
languages. Many verbs can have both transitive (or semitransitive) and intransitive (or reflexive) uses
( 1a), (1b), with no morphologically marking to indicate a change in transitivity. In Urim transitive
verbs are often derived from intransitive ones via addition of the transitive suffixes -en or -e.3. These
suffixes can increase the transitivity of an intransitive verb or clause, making it transitive or
semitransitive (1a), (1c). They can also change semitransitive verbs into fully transitive verbs.

"Descriptive ClauseThe predicate of a descriptive clause differs from the predicate of an equative clause in that it is
non-referential. It only qualifies and describes the subject-referent. The predicate can either be a
nominal phrase as in an equative clause, or an adjectival phrase. The word order is inflexible - the
result would be either unintelligible or an equative clause with different meaning. The subject is
almost always definite and therefore marked by the demonstrative pa, or a pronoun (22c). Without
this demonstrative the clause would look like an attributive noun phrase. Compare the following two
examples:
(21a)(21b)Melnum
manpa
D‘The manis good/well.’Melnum

The notion of ‘topic’ is basically a textual notion, not a syntactic function in the clause. In Urim
textual topics and left dislocations are a very common discourse device. Some of these sentential
topics seem to have been lexicalized into fixed, obligatory parts of certain types of clauses. The status
of these as basic clause types is somewhat marginal the same kind of topicalization structures also
occur as productive discourse devices. Nevertheless, it seems that certain verbs in Urim require an
obligatory argument, which can be called topic. Li-Thompson calls these kinds of structures ‘doublesubject constructions’ (Li 1975: 481). The name conveys the idea that in these constructions the
prototypical features of subject have been split into two constituents: topic and grammatical subject.
Subject is prototypically what the clause is about and also the actor in control in transitive clausesespecially so in Urim (see section 6.4.4). If there is a lack of control in the situation expressed by a
transitive clause, there are usually also some changes in the morphosyntax of the clause. One of these
changes is to move the agent to the clause initial topic position and promote some other referent into
the grammatical subject. In Urim culture certain types of actions are always considered to be outside
of the control of the person involved. Emotions and sensations, as well as most sicknesses are
expressed by verb frames requiring topic arguments. Possession is considered not fully controlled by167
the individual possessor, and for this reason also possessive clauses are topic clauses.9 In topic clauses
both nominal constituents, topic and subject, precede the verb when it is present, but the verb itself
may be omitted too.","[165, 166, 167]"
"Equative ClauseThe equative clause has two noun phrases as obligatory constituents; both denote the same
referent. If the order of these noun phrases is changed, the first NP automatically becomes the
subject of the clause and the meaning of the clause often changes too - this means that the word order
of this clause type is very rigid. Consider the following examples:
(19a)Wail
bigpa
thatkipman
mana-kupm-en.
G-1sg-ATR‘That big one is my husband.’
(19b)Kipman
mana-kupm-en
G-1sg-ATRpa
Dwail.
big‘My husband is a big man.’The subject of an equative clause is nearly always given information and is therefore marked as
definite by the demonstrative pa. Pa ‘that’ and ti ‘this’ also frequently function as demonstrative
pronouns and encode the subjects of equative and descriptive clauses. In other clause types this165
pronominal function is very rare - at least there are no examples of it in the text material used here as
data. A possible reason for this might be the potential for confusion with the numerous instances of
pa and ti functioning as conjunctions and discourse markers in more complex sentences. In the
structural simple nominal clauses, there is less possibility of confusion between the various functions
of these demonstrative forms. The equative clause can, contrary to the descriptive clause, also have
proper noun phrases or pronouns as predicates (20a), (20b). Quite often equative clause consists of
one nominal phrase only (20d). In this case the subject pronoun has been deleted.
(20a)Waring ti,

"4.3. Semitransitive Clauses
In many languages clauses having motion or locative verbs and locative adverbials are classified
as intransitive. Here these clauses are called semitransitive since they are semantically and
syntactically somewhere between transitive and intransitive clauses. The word order and functional
structure of semitransitive clauses is very much like that of transitive clauses in Urim. Both have two
obligatory nominal constituents situated before and after the verb.
Dependency grammar classifies these verbs as two-place predicates since the location or goal can
be considered semantically obligatory with verbs like ‘arrive’ or ‘be situated’. For this reason the
goal or location in these clauses is often called locative object.(Givon 1984: 110, Lyons 1977:496) In
Urim there are no morphological differences between direct objects of transitive clauses and locative
objects; both are morphologically unmarked and always occur immediately following the verb.
Optional locative arguments of the verb are marked by prepositions. The only syntactical difference159
between direct objects and locative objects is that direct objects can be fronted while no fronting of
locative objects has been found in our data.
The ‘less transitive’ status of these clauses is reflected also in the use of transitive suffixes. The
same suffix -en which can change intransitive verbs or clauses into transitive or semitransitive ones
can also change semitransitive verbs into transitive ones. Actually deriving transitive verbs from
semi-transitive ones is much more common in Urim than deriving transitive verbs from intransitive
ones. Compare the following examples (10a,b) with examples (1a,b).
(10a)Kil
rpma
kanokg.
he
sit.R
ground
‘He sits on the ground.’(10b)Kil
arpm -en kar.
he
sit.R - TR car
‘He is waiting for the car.’Semitransitive clauses are here divided into three subtypes: locative clauses, directional clauses,
and resultative clauses. The basic structure of these clause types is the same, but they differ in
meaning, in respect to what semantic role the locative object has, and what verbs can function as
predicates.","[158, 159]"

enough to explain the changes. Often the ordering of rules is not essential, but in some cases it is

"Locative ClauseThe locative clause is structurally similar to the directed motion clause but differs semantically
and in respect to which verbs can function as predicates. This clause type can have as predicates one
of only six posture verbs: rpma ‘sit’, rmpa ‘lie’, itna ‘stand’, rka ‘hang’, ela ‘be situated’, and
ha ‘be around’. Any specific referent can occur as the subject, and the second argument denotes the
location of the subject. A locative object is morphologically unmarked but sometimes a serial verb
construction with one of the motion verbs is used to more precisely specify the location.(12a)Hu

‘The pencil is (up there) on the table.’The locative clause is often used to introduce new information. This does not have any effect on
the word order, which seems to be very rigid just like in the directional clause. The subject always
occurs before the verb and the locative object after it.

EMPIn both (13a) and (13b) the locative clause marks the beginning of a new paragraph or section in
the text, because it introduces a new important participant or other topic to the text. If the new items
are not topical, i.e. important in the text, they are often introduced by using an embedded locative
clause, as in the following examples.(14a)Men

"Chart of Urim Basic Clause Types
NameConstituentsFunctions1 This chapter is an unpublished paper written 1991.
Many grammars talk about predication types instead of clause types, but we have chosen this traditional way of
structuralist grammars to describe these basic syntactic structures of Urim. Also the ideas of dependence grammar have
been used when describing Urim clause types.
2 Some languages allow basic clause types without any ‘proper’ semantic or grammatical subject. For example, in
Finnish the clause Sataa ‘It rains’ consists only of a verb without any semantic subject or subject NP on the surface,
although the verb has third person singular Subject indexing inflection.. The corresponding clause in English has a
semantically ‘empty’ subject it. In Urim these kinds of structures are not possible, unless the structure called here the
time clause is interpreted as having a verb instead of a noun as the only constituent (see section 4.7).",[152]
"Experience ClauseThe topic of an experience clause is also always animate and semantically an experiencer. The
grammatical subject is usually either a body part, where the feeling etc. is located, or an inanimate
referent which is the cause of the feeling or the object of wanting etc. The only common features
such clauses exhibit are: 1) the semantic meaning of involuntary experience, and 2) the presence of an
obligatory topic constituent before the grammatical subject. Most experience clauses have a bound
object pronoun which is coreferential with the topic (24a), (24d), but this pronoun can be absent,
especially if the grammatical subject is a body part of the experiencer (24b), (24c).
The experience clauses with body parts differ structurally from genitive constructions, which are
always of the form Npossessed + a + Ngenitive (wam a melnum ‘man’s hand’) when the possessor is
specific (see section 3.1.4).

different meaning (perhaps having to do with scope of negation) than those negated with kalpis.",[168]
"About Application of RulesMany rules, especially the schwa-rule (rule 10) but also most consonant insertion rules (rules 1, 2)
and the palatalization rule (rule 7) are conditioned by stress so that they either occur only in
unstressed syllables (schwa-rule) or in or after stressed syllables (consonant insertions).
Assimilation rules 7 and 8 and dissimilation rules 9 and 10 apply only inside a phonological word
(except rule 7 b: t --> ts change after palatalization, which can occur over word boundaries). These
rules serve to help in recognizing the phonological word.
Insertion and deletion rules 1-6 apply frequently over word boundaries in phrases and also
elsewhere in rapid speech. The closer knit the structure is, the more regularly most of these rules
apply.
Examples of the application of rule 1.:

2.1. Introduction
The following word classes are distinguished in the syntactic description of Urim:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.verbs
nouns
pro-forms
prepositions
adjectives
quantifiers
adverbs
demonstratives
conjunctions
interjectionsThe remainder of this chapter will examine each of the word classes in more detail, describing
their syntactic characteristics and morphological structure.
It is typical of Urim words in all word classes, that the same phonological form may instance
multiple classes; for example functioning as a noun and a verb, or as an adjective and an adverb.
Some phonological forms exhibit even more than two word classes. In some cases one of the
functions is clearly primary and the other function(s) secondary (for example many verbs can function
as heads in noun phrases without any morphological marking to indicate a change in category). More
often it is impossible to tell which word class is primary for a phonological form; it is bi- or multicategorical.

EMP2.2. Verbs and Their Morphology
Urim verbs are defined as forms having the following characteristics:
1. They may function as the main predicate in simple clauses
Kil
alm
manto, nalu
3sg
shoot.R pig
pick.R
‘He shot a pig and took some taro’wayu
taro2. They exhibit ablaut alternations for irrealis versus realis modality. Approximately two thirds of
the verbs exhibit this property. But all onomatopoetic and descriptive verbs and also many directional
verbs fail to exhibit this property: no irrealis forms of these verbs have been observed. One possible
reason for this might be that these types of verbs in Urim tend to occur together with other verbs (in
serial structures, etc.) rather than alone. To express modality several times in the same clause would
be unnecessary.

‘blink’3. Most verbs in Urim cannot occur in noun phrases. There are exceptions; 1) bi-categorial words—
the same lexical form can function either as verb or as noun. 2) Certain verbs have been
grammaticalized into prepositions. 3) The distinction between adjectives and stative verbs is not clear
in Urim. Many stative verbs may also function as adjectives in noun phrases, with no derivational
morphology to indicate a change in syntactic category.
4. Due to the realis/irrealis distinction, verbs as group also have some phonetic characteristics. A
large percentage of verbs begin with the vowel a (realis) or i (irrealis). Most Urim words beginning22
with the vowel /a/ are verbs. Verb roots usually consist of one or two syllables, with longer roots
being comparatively rare.
Morphologically, Urim verbs are simple in structure, not exhibiting any inflection for person or
number.2 The most important morphological category marked on verbs is a modal one. There is a
distinction of realis/irrealis mode that is indicated by the vowels i ‘irrealis’ and a ‘realis’. The
placement of these two vowels varies quite a bit depending on the canonical shape of the verb, but
usually they occur on the first syllable of the verb stem.
Aspectually, there is a habitual aspect suffix -e, and the use of reduplication of the verb stem to
express repeated or continued action. Most aspects in Urim are expressed by serial structures or
aspectual adverbs.
Two or three types of transitivity altering suffixes are also observed: 1) the transitivising suffix en , 2) the indirect object marker –n,which is possibly related to -en, and 3) the suffix -e which seems
to have both aspectual and transitivity changing functions. Forms homophonic with the suffixes -en
and -e are also used derivationally.
The overall order of constituents in the Urim verb is:
verb root (Habitual-Continuative -e) (Transitive -en) (IO-marker -n) (Object Pronominal Clitic)
In Urim a verb stem can be simple, reduplicated, compound, or consist of a root morpheme plus a
derivational affix (sometimes more than one) (see the section 2.12.3).","[19, 20, 21, 22]"
"Syntactic role of the relative noun within the relative clauseIn Urim relative clauses are very common in texts. The co-referring relative noun within the
relative clause can exhibit almost any syntactic role. Thus far, relative nouns with the roles of Subject,
Object, Indirect Object, Locative Object, Locative, Accompaniment, Time, and Instrument have been
observed.

‘I [will] tell a story about the old woman Pilpatni that lived at Wesakrokg.’
In the last example the relative clause is embedded into the genitive phrase (about the old
woman) modifying the head noun por ‘story’
When some essentially extraneous information is added about the Head Noun (information that
does not specify its referent) an independent clause or an apposition is often used instead of RC. In
the following example, the new person is introduced using both a relative clause and a ‘normal’
descriptive clause:177

was a good, a good-hearted man. He arrived...’
Relative clauses frequently are quite complex and may occur for example embedded into a
genitive phrase or coordinated as modifiers of the same NP. Relative clauses provide a way to
background less-important information so that the main story line remains in focus:

Complement clauses are embedded subordinate clauses, which function as core arguments of
certain verbs.
Clauses functioning as subjects or objects are quite common in Urim with all verbs. Most verbs
of communication take clausal objects.","[173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"Object frontingThe Object can occur in front of the subject, or sometimes between the subject and verb, without
any danger of misinterpretation, since in Urim transitive clauses the subject referent is usually more
animate and than the object referent. If both subject and object are animate, a fronted subject is
usually overtly marked as topic via use of the demonstrative pa or a pronoun:
Nol

Most frequently object fronting occurs in texts, where the topic is an inanimate entity, which
cannot freely occur as subject. In following examples the fronted object represents new information:

It has been possible to elicit an example of a fronted locative objects, but none have been found in
natural texts, and some speakers do not consider it to be very good language:

possible only when the object is generic. The construction does not seem to have any thematic
function.

"Inalienable Genitive
Head (This may be either a single noun or a sequence of nouns occurring as a noun
complex. See below for further discussion.)
Attributive Modifiers (Multiple occurrences of these are possible. When this happens, they
occur in the order: Colour > Size > Quality.)
Quantifiers (Multiple occurrences possible)
Alienable Genitives
Relative Clauses
DemonstrativesAlmost all modifiers can co-occur. Exceptions to this are: 1) alienable genitives do not co-occur
with inalienable genitives, and 2) alienable or inalienable genitives do not co-occur with relative
clauses. There are examples of two relative clauses modifying a Head noun.
A number of examples of Urim noun phrases will now be given which illustrate the above
ordering of noun phrase constituents.",[122]
"Tallying with fingers and toes
All numbers can be tallied with fingers and toes and persons. Tallying begins on the little finger
on the left hand which is bent down (often with help of the right hand) and proceeds in order until the
thumb is bent down, the corresponding tally-direction is wampomis, literally ‘hand-other-whole’.
Tallying then continues by bending down the little finger of the right hand continuing in order until
the thumb is reached, thus giving the total of ten (wampwam, literally ‘hand-hand’). Sometimes upon
reaching 10, the two fists are brought together.
Tallying then proceeds to the toes so that 11 is wampwam yikak wris, literally ‘ hand-hand leg
one’. Preceding from the big toe to the little toe of the left foot in order, 15 is reached, ‘hand-hand
leg-other-whole’. One holds the left fingers on those toes tallied. Tallying continues by holding the
right fingers on the toes tallied on the right foot beginning on the big toe and preceding in order until
the little toe is reached, thus giving a total of 20, (kamel wris, literally ‘person one’).",[84]
"Manner adverbial clauses
In Urim manner is usually expressed by serial constructions, which almost always occur beforethe main verb (like manner adverbs usually do) and can therefore possibly be considered
subordinated:
Kil

Manner serials can be marked by the Instrumental marker ak (originally verb ak ‘do’) same way

In Urim there is also a special type of adverbial manner clause, which always occurs in the middle
of the clause and has a verb morphologically marked by the suffix -en. This attributive suffix has
been described earlier in the section 2.6.2.2. Sometimes this embedded (or nominalized) manner
adverbial clause also has a reversed word order (O V). Curiously though, only a few verbs in Urim
seem to take this suffix in a manner clause, while simple manner adverbs can freely be formed from
all kinds of verbs by the same suffix. It seems that this embedded construction also has the additional
meaning of two actions having temporal overlap. This could explain why so few verbs can occur in
this construction; there are not so very many actions that one actor can perform two at the same time.
Often the manner suffix -en could be glossed ‘with’ in English. Consider the examples:

The basic difference between transitive and intransitive clauses is that an intransitive verb has
only one obligatory argument, whereas a transitive verb has two or more obligatory arguments. In
Urim the difference between obligatory and optional nominal constituents of the clause is quite
consistently reflected in the surface structure. The obligatory constituents are almost always
morphologically unmarked noun phases (no prepositions, no markings on the verb), whereas optional
constituents are usually expressed as prepositional phrases. There are only a few exceptions to this
rule. With certain verbs the second obligatory NP in the clause ( the second argument of the verb) is
morphologically unmarked when it is a pronoun, but requires a preposition when it is a full noun
phrase. These verbs are probably on the borderline between transitive and intransitive verbs Thus
far only a few verbs of this type have been found.

In Urim the subject noun phrase is obligatory in all basic clause types. Even expressions
describing natural phenomena which in many languages have no semantic or surface subjects, or have
a ‘dummy’ subject (like the it in English it rains) require overt subjects in Urim (5a). In text clauses,
however, subjects are often absent as the result of ellipsis, when the identity of the subject referent is
clear from the previous context.","[154, 155, 156]"
"The far demonstrative paThe word pa is by far the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 28,000 words, pa occurs over
3,500 times. About half of these are conjunctive uses of pa. In spoken Urim, intonation often helps
to distinguish the different functions of pa. When pa is used as conjunction, it tends to be longer and
more stressed than when it is a noun phrase constituent (see also section 5.5.6).
The following examples illustrate the use of pa as a demonstrative pronoun:
Waring
ti,
yikal pa

‘The betel nut is here, the bow palm is there’

‘I would like to learn many kinds of languages, but it is very difficult.’91
Because of its many functions at discourse level the purely demonstrative function of pa is
somewhat restricted in Urim. It can freely occur as independent demonstrative pronoun in most
positions, like the examples above show, but does not often occur as the subject of transitive or
intransitive clauses. The reason is probably that an independent word pa starting a clause could
easily be interpreted as a conjunction. Also it seems, that pa occurring as locative object would be
easily interpreted as emphatic particle. For this reason a deictic adverb is used instead. Compare the
following examples:
Mentekg

thereThis last example was elicited. The native speaker did not accept the expression wayu pa in this
clause, possibly because the clause was not part of any context or text. When pa is used with NP, it
almost always marks givenness (refers back to something mentioned in the text or known from the
context) and the demonstrative meaning is bleached. Therefore different combinations of verb + pa
are used instead to make it clear that the speaker refers to location, not to givenness.

"Numeral Phrases
Most numerals in Urim are formally coordinate phrases, which have the structure:
(Quantity Classifier (numeral))n (numeral)with the quantity classifiers—e.g. wampomis ’hand-other-whole’/’5’, wamwam ’hand-hand’/’10’,
yikakwom ’leg-other’ / ’numeral beyond 10’, yikakwomis ’leg-other-whole’ / ’five beyond 10’, and
kamel ’person’ / ’20’—being ordered from larger to smallerwam-pomis wam-pom

Clausal objects are usually unmarked morphologically and in speech no pause separates the main
clause from the complement.
Clausal objects are sometimes governed by the conjunctions la ‘speak/that’ or eng ‘OBL’. With
some verbs, the use of a conjunction is obligatory (and these complement clauses are not considered
real clause objects)
With other verbs, semantically obligatory clausal objects are sometimes marked by conjunctions,
and sometimes not. Typically the nominal objects of these verbs are likewise sometimes marked, and
sometimes not. The presence of a governing conjunction in the complement clause seems sometimes
to depend on transitivity, in that a conjunction is used when the action is considered weakly transitive.
For example the action of ‘liking’ / ‘wanting’ in the following examples does not much affect its
object:

respect, they are distinct fromthe cognitive verbs. They take only one object (either NP or clause),
but the subject of embedded clause can possibly be raised into object position in the clause (see the

quotations. Almost all indirect quotes in our data are from discussions, but they probably also occur
in other expository discourses like sermons and exhortations. Indirect quotations mainly differ from
direct quotations in their person deixis..

"116Reduplication as Means of Forming Words
There are partial and full reduplications of noun, verb, adjective, numeral and adverb stems. The
fully reduplicated words present the same kind of problem as compounds: it is not always clear
whether they are compounds or phrases.
Examples of nouns formed by reduplication:
nangnang ‘singsing-feast, song’
mammam ‘Mom (vocative)’
kirngkarng ‘corn hulks’
paipmpaipm ‘sins, wrongs, troubles’nang
man
kirng
paipmname’
‘mother’
‘border’
‘bad’Adjectives formed by reduplication are comparatively rare (possibly because reduplication is
commonly used to intensify adjectives):
pulpulpilpalet /pulpul#pilpal-et/ ‘spotted’
krukgkrakget /krakg#krakg-et/ ‘multicolored’
kirngkirng
‘thick’
Examples of adverbs:
yongkyong
hirir
ariworwor‘for ever’
‘similar; close’
‘very well’ari ‘see’,Examples of numerals and other quantifiers:
kamel kamel
‘a lot, 400’
wampwam
‘ten’
auraur
‘all kinds of’krakg
kirngwor‘string, mark’
‘border’‘good’kamel ‘person’
wam ‘hand’
aur ‘cover’Verbs formed by reduplication are very common, especially onomatopoetic ones:
pirpir
‘run, hurry’
pirng ‘run to’
prisprus
‘crunch’
prus ‘crunch’
kwelngkwelng
‘wail’

hereThe suffix -en with adjectives lessens the property of the adjective the more it is repeated (see
section 4.5.3 ‘Comparison of Adjectives’):
kongket-en -en -en
black -ATR-ATR-ATR‘just a little bit black’In the same way, the partial repetition of a temporal adverb can be used to express increased
length of time:
pikekg-tak-ai
past - ? -remote‘long ago’pikekg-tak-tak-ai
past -? -? -remote‘very long ago’Also the words paipm and wor that are used as increased degree with adjectives, can be
reduplicated to strengthen the degree even more:
watet
paipm-paipm
red
bad-bad
‘very dark red’Repetition Encoding Plurality
One way of encoding plurality is to repeat the noun. This usually encodes indefinite amount of
referents. (see 3.3.2) Often the modifiers of NP—adjectives, adverbs, or numerals—can be repeated
instead of the Head noun. Sometimes even the verb can be repeated to encode the plurality of one of
its arguments (subject or object). In this case it usually encodes distributive aspect at the same time
(see also 2.13.2.4). Repetitions encoding plurality are only seldom written as one word.

‘I get up and cook food every morning (for them) to eat’ (a woman describing her daily

Adjectives:
In the following examples the repetition of an adjective marks the plurality of the whole NP.
Men

coffee branch G long
bad
bad
G climb pick.R D
‘the coffee branches that are very long so that one has to climb up in order to pick
[them].’
In the last example the word paipm ‘bad’ serves as intensifier of the adjective watinet ‘long’, and
the reduplication of paipm encodes the plurality of the whole NP.
Adverbs and numerals:
Repetition of the verb is commonly used to express repetition, but sometimes also other words
like adverbs or numerals are reduplicated to indicate repetitive action. Usually repetition of verb in
these cases encodes plurality at the same time (see also the examples of complex nouns below):
Elng wris wris itni
kopi

‘She works like that every day.’ (shorter form: ak-angklei-angklei)
Noun complexes119
In the case of noun complexes, only one of the constituents needs to be repeated or reduplicated to
mark the plurality of the whole complex. Usually it is the second noun serving as modifier that is
reduplicated (This second noun usually expresses a part of the head noun or further specifies the
referent):
Kil
angken wanukg mpil
mpil (-en)
3sg pick.R greens
bundle bundle(-ATR)
‘She picks many bundles of greens.’
In this example the repetition/reduplication has a special function: it refers more to repeated action
than to the plurality of the whole noun phrase itself. In the situation the actor takes something from a
plural entity of things one by one. These examples do not indicate whether the actor handles (picks or
cuts) all the greens; some might be left.","[115, 116, 117, 118, 119]"
"Monotransitive ClausesThe characteristic of this clause type is that it has an obligatory direct object with the usual
semantic role of affected patient or patient-of-result. Unlike locative objects, this object can be easily
fronted for thematic purposes.. The verb in this clause can either be a non-derived transitive verb or a
transitive verb derived by a transitivizer suffix.
The semantic role of the transitive subject is almost exclusively that of agent. This means that
usually only animate referents occur as subjects of transitive clauses. Agents are prototypically
animate, volitional and active causes of an action. In Urim forces of nature and moving machines can
also frequently occur as transitive subjects. When other, less prototypical kinds of inanimate entities
occur as transitive subjects there are usually some morphological changes in the clause: the ultimate
agent occurs as clause topic at the beginning (16b), or an instrumental serialization with the verb ak
’do’ is used(16a).8

cut.R -2sg.O‘Mowal (accidentally) cut himself with an axe.’In example (16b) the actor hurts himself accidentally. In this case the instrument usually appears
as the subject and the actor as the object of the clause
A number of examples are now given of normal transitive clauses with clause initial subjects
bearing the semantic role of agent. Transitive clauses can also have an optional indirect object, which
is usually marked by the preposition eng or the affix -n on the verb (underlined).

clauses. There are relatively few verbs that require three obligatory arguments. The semantic role of
the third argument can be benefactive or recipient and sometimes also locative or instrumental. The
ditransitive subtype is here defined purely on a structural basis. Optional benefactives etc. are almost
always marked by the preposition eng, which is reduced into a suffix -n occurring between the verb
and direct object, if the direct object is a personal pronoun (17d), (17e). Obligatory benefactives etc.
are morphologically unmarked.
In some cases the border between obligatory and optional third argument is not clear
morphologically. If the verb already has a suffix -en, there will be no other suffix -n as the result of
dative shift (17 f). Certain verbs behave sometimes like ditransitive verbs, sometimes like monotransitives; compare examples (18c) and (18d). The example (18d) is monotransitive since the
locative phrase kai ampei cannot occur without the preposition. This shows the same kind of
phenomena of gradual transitivity that was discussed earlier in the section 2.

The nominal clause consists of two nominal phrases or a nominal phrase and an adjective phrase.
No overt copula occurs linking the subject/topic noun phrase and the nominal or adjectival predicate.
There are two types of nominal clauses: equative and descriptive.
A negative nominal clause is formed by the verbal negation word ake (22e) even if there is no
verbal predicate. This distinguishes the nominal clause from the possessive clause, which sometimes
looks similar (23d).","[162, 163, 164]"
"Time ClausesThere are two structurally peculiar types of clause that could be described as subtypes of the
intransitive clause. One of them, which is here called the time clause, consists of one element only;
a noun phrase denoting time of day. The reasons why these words are not considered lexical verbs
are: 1) these time words do not have any case frame with arguments, in other words, the time clause
never has any other obligatory elements except the time word itself, which functions both as the
subject and the predicate of the clause. 2) In Urim nouns and verbs do not usually have the same
morphological form in the lexicon (like English ‘love’ or ‘fish’ for example), although verbs and verb
phrases can easily be nominalized without any formal marking. 3) Another reason fro classifying time
words as nouns is that adjectives can be formed from them by the suffix –et. This is rare with verbs.
4) Aspectual, temporal, and modal particles can occur in this time clause the same way as in verbal
clauses. This is possible, because they do not belong to the verbal morphology but are clausal
particles.
Time words also resemble verbs semantically more closely than most other nouns, since the
points of time are not actually fixed units but processes. Normally nouns represent the most
permanent states, verbs the most rapidly changing states, and adjectives are somewhere in between
(Givon 1979a: 265-266).4
The time clause is fairly common in texts but is sometimes difficult to differentiate from
dislocations.(6a)Kong,

go4 In Urim time is not associated with location like in many other languages (Lyons 1977:669). No locative prepositionsappear in time adverbials; instead the verb ak ‘do’ is used. This word is used also as the instrumental and manner phrase
marker.",[156]
"The conjunction pa
The different functions of pa
The word pa is the commonest word in Urim. In a corpus of 35 texts containing over 28,000
words pa occurs about 355 times. This corpus contains mostly spoken texts but also some written
ones. Pa is somewhat less common in written texts. In some clauses the word pa occurs 4 times.
This is possible because of the many functions of this morpheme. The basic meaning of pa is far
deictic—‘there’. When it functions as a modifier within a noun phrase, pa usually marks givenness /
psychological accessibility of a referent to the hearer, but it can also function as a topic marker
following various sorts of topicalized or left-dislocated constituents indicating a new temporal setting,
a new or changed topic, or focus. As a phrasal head, pa can have following functions: deictic pronoun
‘that’, locative adverb ‘there’, emphatic particle, and conjunction.
In speech pa has certain phonetic features that help distinguish its various functions. As a
conjunction, pa is either preceded or followed by a pause. Native speakers are often unsure about
where to write the comma in written language. But in spoken language the differences of function
associated with pre- or post-pausal occurrence of pa are clearer. It is generally the case in the
language that whenever a conjunction occurs before a pause, it is pronounced with a distinctive rising
intonation and often its final vowel is also lengthened. This is true for pa as well.",[222]

Imperative modus is in Urim optionally expressed by using the clause-final imperative clitic –o.
In imperative clause the verb or verbs are always in irrealis mode. Sometimes this clitic occurs in the
form –om, which adds the meaning ‘now’ (possibly shortened from am ’now’). Imperative clitic is
always attached to the last word of the clause or sentence:

As the examples above show, in imperative clauses the subject may or may not appear on the
surface. Reason is pragmatical, since Urim verbs do not encode person or plurality.
Following examples show that the clitic –o appears only once in the sentence:

"Underived AdjectivesThe class of underived adjectives in Urim is comparatively small. As in many other languages,
the basic, most common adjectives are usually morphologically simple. Semantically these basic
adjectives encode permanent properties of the entities, such as size, shape, age, or colour. Some of
the principal underived adjectives in Urim are listed below:

stand.RNote from the last example above that when an adjective is used attributively, the noun phrase
being characterized is set off from the predicative adjective by a demonstrative (pa, ti, kil, ai).
The border between verbs and adjectives in Urim is in many cases difficult to draw. Even such
basic adjectives that denote less permanent properties may occur as predicates not only in nominative
clauses (first example) but also in intransitive clauses with the imperative clitic -o. (possibly only in
special uses like incantations) and in experiential clauses that have both a topic and a Subject (last
example):

Kupm

1sg

be analysed as verbs.
On the other hand many stative verbs denoting state or change of state can function as attributive
modifiers within the noun phrase:60kupm

‘I broke the tree’

’The woman with broken leg is in the house’wan
houseThere are some minor syntactic differences between stative verbs and adjectives denoting nonpermanent properties. 1) The verbs expressing process or state (which can function as either
attributive modifiers in the noun phrase or as intransitive predicates) can usually also function as
transitive verbs. Pure adjectives cannot. 2) Only adjectives occur as complements of resultative
clause, that is, they require the help of some predicate when a process is described. But, as we have
seen, adjectives may occur as predicates with the completive aspect marker ise, when the attention is
focused to the actual result, not to the process itself. 3) Only adjectives occur as modifiers in noun
complexes, that is, in the animal and plant names.

"How Noun Complexes differ from Apposition, Coordinative Noun Phrases,
Compound Nouns and Inalienable Genitive Constructions
Phonologically, the sequences of nouns in noun complex usually are separate words but the
difference between these structures and compounds is not always clear. The noun complexes
consisting of pronoun and noun are clearly two phonological words as well as the animal and plant
names. Other specifying noun+noun combinations and kinship terms tend to be pronounced as one
phonological word with one main stress, and can be termed compounds. The borderline between
compounds and phrases is a continuum.
Semantically, the noun complex is relatively transparent, with each of the subsequent nouns
functioning attributively to restrict the reference of the head noun. Here they differ clearly from
coordinated phrases where none of the parts functions as a modifier of another. Coordinated nouns
always exhibit separate intonational contours, while in noun complex one noun (almost always the
second one) usually has the main stress. Sequences of coordinated nouns can function as a complex
head of a noun phrase and as a unit be modified by other NP modifiers:

Coordinated noun phrases tend to get lexicalized and be pronounced as one phonological word.

D‘parents’The most important difference between a noun complex and an appositional noun phrase is that
the parts of noun complexes are not interruptible by other noun phrase modifiers. This is in contrast
to true apposition, in which the appositional noun phrase occurs after the full noun phrase, and
therefore there can be multiple modifiers intervening between the head noun of the noun phrase and
the head noun of the appositional noun phrase. Consider the following examples:
warim
a-kupm Karis

G-1pl.Inc -ATRInalienable genitive constructions and noun complexes are similar formally and phonologically,
but differ in that the initial noun phrase functions as a genitive modifier of the following noun rather
than the following noun functioning as a modifier of the initial noun. Also, the genitive noun phrase
itself can contain modifiers, whereas the head noun in a noun complex would not have any modifiers:
wan-yun(house-door)‘door’129

nailAdjectives and Quantifiers in the Noun PhraseIt is possible to have more than one adjective modifier in a noun phrase, although occurrences of
more than two adjectives modifying one noun phrase are not common in texts (see section 5.1 for an
example of three adjectives modifying a head.). The typical ordering of multiple adjectives is color >
size > quality. The adjective paipm ‘bad’ tends to occur before other adjectives, because the same
form is also used as degree adverb ‘very’ modifying adjectives (third example). The diminutive word
yek ‘poor’ usually occurs after other adjectives.

The exact order of quantifiers in the noun phrase has not been investigated enough yet. Usually
numerals occur after non-numeric quantifiers. The indefinite ur ‘a, one’ can be classified either as
quantifier or deictic; in the noun phrase it occurs between these two constituents.

Urim is a non-Austronesian language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Laycock (1973) classifies it as a
stock-level isolate of the Torricelli Phylum. It is spoken by about 3400 people, who live in 16 villages
in the southern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains. Twelve of the villages are located south of the
Sepic Highway, and one is north of the highway, in the Maprik Sub-District of East Sepik Province. The
remaining three of the villages are located west of the Bongos River in the Nuku Sub-District of the
West Sepik Province. The villages west of the Bongos River speak the Kukwo dialect, and the villages
east of the Bongos River speak the main Urim dialect (also called Yangkolen by the Kukwo people).
The Urim language has also been called Kalp, which comes from the word kalpm ‘no’ in the Kukwo
dialect.
Earlier linguistic work on Urim was done by Glasgow and Loving (1964) and D.C. Laycock (1966 and
1973). The authors entered the area in 1979 under the auspices ot the Summer Institute of Linguistics
The data for this paper were collected mainly between 1980 – 1995 in the village of Laningwap. The
data includes a corpus of about 40 spoken and written texts along with some elicited material. The team
participated in a grammar analysis seminar at the S.I.L. center in Ukarumpa in 1981. Their consultants
were Robert Bugenhagen and Robert Conrad. Pirkko Luoma participated in a second grammar analysis
seminar in 1993 and was greatly helped by her consultant Robert Bugenhagen. Paul Heinemann also
provided many valuable suggestions and helped with the formatting of the paper.
This grammar consists of three parts that have been written independently from each other. The first
part, chapters 1 to 3, was written by Pirkko Luoma with some additions by Ritva Hemmilä. Chapter 4 is
an unpublished article written by Ritva Hemmilä in 1984. Chapters 5 and 6 were written by Ritva
Hemmilä with some corrections and additions by Pirkko Luoma.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"

crowdIn Urim compound verbs are quite common, but it is not always easy to tell whether two verbs
form a serial structure or a compound verb stem. Consider the following examples that show how a
verb phrase which is phonologically one word, can be grammatically a phrase (as we saw with nouns
in the section 1.5.1):
[‘:kw:p]kil
3sgak-kwap
do-work.Rkil
3sgak- n -opm [‘:ktopm]
do.R-TR-1sgO‘he works’kwap‘he works for me’
workSome idiomatic verb phrases containing ak are pronounced as two phonological words with more
than one main stress, others as one phonological phrase with one main stress. In both cases the
phrasal idiom is a single lexeme with a single, non-compositional meaning. No objects or other
constituents can be placed in between the parts of these idioms:

do.R-mouth-say‘to beg’tu‘they are laughing at me’aknokg-el-opm113
theydo.R salt-3sg-1sgOCompounding with the verb ak ‘(use something to) do’ is a common means of expressing
causativity in Urim. Consider the following examples, which are phonologically one word but can be
interpreted as either lexemes or grammatical structures:

Urim also has compound adjectives and adverbs, although they are much less common than
compound nouns. Almost all numerals are formally compounds or complex phrases. Many personal
pronouns, especially dual and paucal forms are compounds. All this shows that compounding is a
very productive means of forming words in Urim.

In Urim reduplication is a very common morphological device; it has both derivational and
several different grammatical uses. In reduplication the word or stem is usually repeated once, in
some cases several times. Almost all word classes can be reduplicated: nouns, verbs, adjectives,
adverbs, quantifiers, etc.
The term reduplication refers to the copying of part (or all) of a stem and by this definition can
happen only inside a phonological word. The repetition of free forms (words) is not usually called
reduplication, but here both are described together. In Urim it is sometimes hard to tell, whether or
not a a repeated expression has been lexicalized. The whole process of lexicalization is a gradual
phenomenon, a continuum, where there are often border cases between full lexemes and phrases (see
Givon 1979 Ch.5). This is also reflected in the developing Urim writing system.
When new words are formed by reduplication, the two parts usually form one phonological word
and are written together. When the reduplication or repetition has grammatical functions, parts are
usually written separately, but may also be written together. The problem whether reduplicated
construction is one or two words can be compared to the similar problem with compounds (see
2.12.1).","[111, 112, 113, 114]"

It will also be noted that all singular and second person forms begin with <k>; all non-singular
third person forms begin with tu-, and all non-singular first person forms begin with m (e,i)n-.
The pronouns may occur in the following clausal slots: 1) subject (or topic in topic clauses), 2)
non-topical first object, 3) second object, and 4) object of a preposition.

Subject referent is very generic or indefinite. Indefinite reference is sometimes also expressed by zero
anaphora, if some other NP is in the topic position in the clause. Third person singular indefinite
referents are also often expressed by using the noun kamel ‘body’ (comp. old English!) at least in the
object position. The third person plural pronoun tu is also used within the noun phrase to encode
plurality of human (or at least animate) entities (see section 2. 3. 1. 1)

The third person singular person pronoun kil sometimes functions as a demonstrative pronoun
instead of the near demonstrative ti, and may in this function be attached to other singular pronouns or
nouns (see also the first example above). In this function kil can refer both to animate and inanimate
entities:

demonstrative pa occurs modifying a personal pronoun, this construction has thematic function. The
demonstrative pa is used with personal pronouns to emphasize, express contrast, and mark something
as topical. This last function of pa makes it possible that in Urim texts two persons can be referred by
personal pronouns all the way through after initial introduction, even when the actor or speaker
changes:
Kupm asen kil pa om:.... Ari kil pa la-la:...
1sg
ask.R 3sg D now
but 3sg D say-say
‘I asked him now:.... And he said:...’ (pa marks the change of speaker))42
Kipm pa wakg ur kol men
kil
aki?

ID like 1pl.Exc 3sg/here or
‘Do you have a fire like we here?’ (contrast, emphasis)
Personal pronouns may also occur as part of coordinated and complex noun phrases:

‘One day I and Karis, we two went to hunt in moonlight.’

The Object pronominal clitics are phonologically adjoined to the verb. They conflate the nonsingular number categories of the free pronouns, distinguishing only: 1) first, second, and third
persons, and 2) singular versus non-singular numbers.
Person
1
2
3Singular
=opm
=etn/eitn
==elNon-Singular
=o
=epm
=enFollowing the applicative verbal suffix -n, a further inclusive versus exclusive distinction is made in
the first person plural forms:
1
1=(n)tilo
=nto/-(n)=ilo/
/-n=o/(Inclusive)
(Exclusive)In the form –(n)tilo /n/ surfaces in quick speech, but not in slow and careful speech.
It can be seen that the singular Object pronominal clitics and the second person plural form
resemble the free pronouns, but have undergone two changes: 1) loss of initial /k/, and 2) lowering of
the high vowels /i,u/ to /e,o/.
The Object pronominal clitics occur in the first Object slot, immediately following the verb, and
are phonologically bound to the verb. Consider the following examples:
Takgni
al =o
sun
eat.R-1plO
‘The sun burned us badly’
Kil
antin

3pl
measure.R-1sgO
‘He measured me’

3pl
put.R-3plO road-road
‘They left them out (of the car) along the road’
Uwi – n – til=o!
take.IR-TR-3sgO-1plO
‘Take it for us!’
As the examples show, there are some morphophonemic changes when the pronoun clitic is
attached to the verb. These changes follow the general morphophonemic rules explained in Chapter
1.
It is also possible for the free pronouns to occur in the Object slot. Compare the following examples:
Tu
or-opm
3pl
hit-1sgO
‘They hit me’
Tu
or kupm ti-ke!
3sg hit 1sg
this/here-EMP
‘It was me they hit!’

tell.R-3sgOAtom kupm la naki kil pa
la-la: ....
then
1sg
say tell.R 3sg D
say-say
‘Then I told told to him:...’ (changing topic)
A bound pronominal Object is used when there is no need to highlight the pronoun for purposes
of contrast, emphasis, etc. The free pronoun is always used if any modifier co-occurs with the Object
pronoun. In the example immediately above, the demonstrative pronoun pa is used either for
emphasis or because the actor changes after this clause.
What is said here applies also when a personal pronoun is used to refer to a peripheral clausal
argument (its semantic role typically being Recipient-Benefactive or Locative-Goal) . It is promoted
to core argument in the form of bound pronoun when the referent is an already activated topic that is
simply being maintained. All uses of the bound Object pronouns are thematically unmarked ‘normal’
uses. The use of a free pronoun in this position indicates extra prominence or emphasis on the referent
(for more examples see Section 2.2.4).
The object pronominal clitics also occur as the result of a syntactic process of possessor
ascension, which lifts the possessor of an inalienable noun (usually a body part) out of the noun
phrase to serve as the Object of the verb. It is possible to have both the Object clitic and a coreferential genitive pronoun if the possessor referent is especially emphasized or in focus, as in the
second example below:44Drapuk

eyeWhen the verb and body part form a lexical unit, the Object pronominal clitic is obligatory. This
might be the origin of the use of suffix -el in idioms and lexemes as adverbializer. Compare
especially the two first examples below:

The genitive pronouns exhibit the same person, number, and exclusive-inclusive distinctions as
the independent pronouns, being formed by phonologically adjoining the relative clause
complementizer a to a following independent pronoun. In essence, then, genitives in Urim are
formally a kind of minimal relative clause: pig that (is) I/mine = my pig.
In addition, one or both of the following two modifications to the pronominal forms are possible:
1) the attributive suffix -en may be added to them, and 2) an /l/ may be added between the relative
clause complementizer a and the independent pronominal form. Thus, there are four possible forms
for each genitive pronoun. 8

The genitive pronouns occur following the noun and indicate relationships like: 1) kinship, 2)
body parts, 3) ownership, 4) production, 5) belongingness, 6) Exclusion/Emphatis (only the forms
containing the consonant /l/ but lacking the suffix; alkupm etc.).

"Moving of subject after verbPlacing the subject after the verb is rather rare in Urim but can occur at least in certain clause
types and when there is no danger of misinterpretation. No examples of this have been found in
transitive clauses, but it seems to happen with subjects of transitive verbs in topic constructions
(second example).

The thematic motivation of moving the subject after the verb seems to be strong emphasis or
focusing of new information. In spoken utterances the subject NP is usually phonologically
emphasized, being pronounced with high pitch and stress on the last word.",[243]

-When pa occurs after a pause, it usually functions as a coordinating conjunction linking
clauses encoding two successive event. Sometimes pa is also used when there is some sort
of weak causation involved; for example the previous event must occur before the following
one can happen (time sequence, local connection etc.). The conjunction pa that occurs after
a pause is usually unstressed, but can be stressed in order to emphasize the temporal or
causal relationship between the conjoined clauses. When pa is unstressed, it is difficult to
distinguish it from the coordinative conjunction a, since both can be pronounced and written
as wa. Still, the fact that these both can occur next to each other in the same clause shows
that they are separate words (as in the following example).

-Pa occurs before a pause following causal adverbial clauses or the protases of conditions,
but it can also express temporality, when the speaker wants to emphasize what follows, like
in the example below where something unexpected happens:
Kil amo plalng pa,
kil
wa
3sg die.R finish
C
3sg
D
‘She died, then she returned back to life’--yaper kul
wa
rpma
return come again sit.RPhonetically a conjunction occurring before a pause is quite distinct: it is pronounced with
rising intonation and the final syllable (usually the final vowel but also for example the final
nasal in the word atom) is lengthened. This intonation helps to separate it from an anaphoric
pa attached to an NP, which often occurs in the same position in the clause.
When the phonetic features of the various occurrences of pa in one oral text were
instrumentally analysed27, the vowel in the conjunctive occurrences of pa (both stressed and
unstressed) was on the average approximately twice as long as the vowel in the anaphoric
occurrences of pa.. This difference in length helps to distinguish the different uses of this
morpheme. In written Urim the above-mentioned phonetic distinctions are not marked,
except for the pause. Many writers tend to write all three—the deictic pa, the coordinative
conjunction wa, and the causative conjunction pa—the same way when they are unstressed:
wa . Other writers, however, distinguish them.","[222, 223]"
"Clauses Predicating ExistenceAnother subtype of intransitive clause, the existence clause, is also common in the texts. It
usually takes the same sort of posture verbs as the locative clause as predicates, but does not have any
locative object. Another difference from locative clauses (described in the section 6.4.2) is that the
negative form of existence clause is always verbless, and it is possible to omit the verb in some
positive existence clauses as well. Verbal clauses are negated using the verbal negative particle ake
(see example 7d), but in a negated existence clause the nominal negative word kalpis is used instead,
and the verb is missing.(7a)(7b)(7c)(7d)Men

only(Here the first clause is negative and verbless. Second clause has werpm as subject and rmpa as
predicate.)The existence clause often has the same thematic functions as certain left dislocations in Urim and
the existential clause in English; it is used to introduce new items to the text. This explains also why
the subject in this clause type can move so easily after the verb. The position after the verb is
universally the place of new information in the clause, and in existential clauses the subject usually is158
new information, while in other clause types it is usually given information. The following examples
illustrate how existence clauses and left dislocation are used the same way to introduce main
participants at the beginning of a text. They also show how difficult it is sometimes to tell the
difference between left dislocation and existence clause.

"Left dislocated Subjects
Subjects are commonly dislocated in Urim and are usually represented by a coreferring pronoun
within the sentence. Subject dislocations are a common way of introducing new topics. If the topic
is new information, the left dislocated Subject is often marked by a combination of the indefinite
quantifier ur and the demonstrative pa:

corresponds with the object of the subsequent sentence, and this object is also fronted to further
emphasize the new, surprising participant in the story.

3sgIn the above examples the serial motion verb is necessary to define the semantic role of the NP.
When a position verb is predicate, the NP expressing Locative Goal has the status of Object in Urim
and is grammatically unmarked like the object of transitive verbs. (This is why these predicates are
called semitransitive in Urim.) With semitransitive verbs the serialization with motion verbs is used
to add extra information about the direction of the distance of the Goal in relation to the speaker.

"Locative adverbial clauses:Locative adverbial clauses in Urim are comaratively rare. Sometimes adverbial clauses
expressing location are governed by prepositions, as in the following example.

EMPPurpose-reason clauses marked by engThe basic function of the word eng is to mark oblique arguments. As a preposition, it governs
especially indirect objects (mostly Benefactive and Recipient roles) and also some direct objects of
less transitive verbs. To show the range of eng, I will first present here some examples of its use
governing noun phrases and then examples of its use as a complementizer within subordinate clauses.",[189]
"Serial structuresSerial structures are formally of four types: coordinated, subordinated with main verb last,
subordinated with main verb first, and preposition-like serials. The functions of serial structures are
very various.
It is common to juxtapose several verbs together in Urim with no intervening conjunctions. In
some cases, the meaning of the combination is quite transparent, whereas in others it is more
opaque/idiomatic.

Verbs expressing the manner of action usually occur before the semantically main verb in the verb
phrase. Normally no other constituents occur between the manner verb and the predicate following
it.

others, but the verbal modal distinction of realis-irrealis is always present.

4.1. Introduction and Chart of Clause Types
The clause is the basic syntactic unit occurring between the phrase and the sentence.1 When
describing the clauses of a language, it is important to clearly distinguish between the notions of text
clause and basic or kernel clause. Text clauses consist of both nuclear and peripheral elements, and
quite often some of the nuclear elements are not present in the clause if they are known from the
textual context or environmental context or are part of the semantic content of the verb. A basic
clause consists of nuclear elements only and is a ‘perfect’ or ‘full’ clause in the sense that it does not
have any elided constituents and it can be understood without a text context. Generative grammar
defines kernel clauses or sentences as being minimal in the sense that they cannot be derived from
other clauses. This excludes passive, imperative, interrogative etc. types from basic clause types.
(Lyons 1979, Givon 1984)
Nuclear elements of the clause are the predicate, which is usually a verb, and its obligatory or core
arguments. In nonverbal clauses the NP or adjective phrase functions as the predicate. In Urim a
clause can minimally consist of only a single predicative noun phrase. Basic clauses consisting only
of a verb are not allowed2, although this kind of text clause is very common as the result of ellipsis
and clause chaining. All clauses can also have various types of optional adjuncts: accompaniment,
instrument, time, location, reason, etc. In Urim the number of optional elements in a clause is usually
restricted to at most two. The occurrence of these is semantically determined, and does not affect the
description of the basic clause types.","[150, 151, 152]"
"Introducing new participants and referents to discourseIn Urim new participants and referents are introduced by various means: full NP, full NP plus
relative clause, full NP plus indefinite ur, full NP plus the demonstrative pa, full NP plus a
combination of ur and pa. In addition, there are also special clause and phrase types, which are used
for introducing new participants.
New items that are not topical, are usually introduced by a full noun phrase, with or without the
indefinite quantifier ur. Ur is not used if it is clear from the context that there can be only one
referent:

There are different ways to introduce topical new referents. Left dislocations and special
presentative constructions are used. This is especially the case at the beginning of texts, but also
happens sometimes at the beginning of a new paragraph.. When new main participants are introduced
in a narrative text, very often the combination of ur pa is used (with or without left dislocation). Here
the indefinite ur expresses that the participant is new information, while the demonstrative pa marks
the referent of the NP as topical. If the identity of the new participant is further specified by a
relative clause, pa is not used:
Kiin

demonstratives , regardless of whether or not they are topical. When the introduced participants are
inherently definite NPs like pronouns or proper nouns, the beginning of a story is often marked by
adding pa or ur pa to a sentence-initial time adverbial.

If the new participant or other topic is introduced using special presentative clauses like the
following, no deictic particles are used:
Tuwekg walmamiin.

In the last example the theme or name of this traditional story is mentioned in the presentative
clause, and the main actor is marked as topical via use of ur pa.
New important participants can also be introduced by using just pa. This commonly happens in
traditional narratives, where the participants are already familiar to the hearers:

personIn case the new referents are not topical, i.e. they will not be recurringly referred to in the text,
they are often modified by an embedded locative clause when first introduced, as in the following two
examples.

go upThere is universal tendency in languages to avoid having new information introduced into the text
in Subject position (Givon 1979a :72-74). In Urim, however, it is possible to have Subjects introducing new information, but often left-dislocations, existence clauses or topic structures are used to
avoid this. Only topical, important items are introduced to the text in subject position. Less important
items are usually introduced in the typical position of new information after the verb. In Urim this NP
introducing new information quite often has an embedded locative clause as a constituent. Some of
these are lexicalized into deictic adverbials, like the expression ha-pa in the examples above.","[247, 248, 249]"
"Left DislocationLeft dislocations and topic constructions are common thematical devices in Urim. Their main
function is to mark topics, especially when new topics are introduced or when a topic changes. When
a constituent occurs at the beginning of a sentence, outside the clause proper and there is also some
kind of co-referring constituent within the remainder of the sentence, this is termed here “leftdislocation”. Those constructions where no such coreferring element exists are termed “topic
constructions”. In Urim this formal distinction is not very important pragmatically, since both types
of construction have the same discourse functions.
In a typical left dislocation construction, the dislocated NP occurs separated from the sentence
proper, while a co-referring pronoun within the following sentence indicates its syntactic role. In
Urim the dislocated NP can also be represented in the sentence by other means, depending on the
syntactic role of the dislocated constituent. Almost any argument of a clause can be left-dislocated,
while usually only Objects are fronted. Sometimes only a pause separates the dislocated NP from the
sentence, but often the dislocated NP is marked by a following demonstrative or personal pronoun.",[245]
"Verb plus Demonstrative Adverb ConstructionsUrim has also special type of construction consisting of a motion or locative verb and
demonstrative adverb. These seem to be partly lexicalized serial structures functioning adverbially.
All three demonstrative words, pa, ti, and ai, can occur in this construction, kil only seldom.
Actually these three demonstratives are found in clear contrast only in this construction:
Kil
rpma
kai-pa
3sg
sit.R
go-there
‘He sits there’ (the referent is visible)
Kil
rpma
kai-ti / ti
3sg
sit.R
go-here / here
‘He sits here’ (near the speaker)
Kil
rpma
kai-ai
3sg
sit.R
go-remote
‘He sits over there’ (more distant compared to something else or not visible at all)
Often the serialized verb is added just to give more information about the location of referent like
in the following example:
Kil
kul karkok wang-wang rmpa-wai
3sg come blaze.R stem-stem lie -remote
‘He came and blazed the tree-stems lying there.’
Yo
kinar
ai
trum
tree go.down remote
kapok
‘The tree down there is kapok’100
In other cases the serialized construction is used because plain demonstrative adverb could
potentially be misinterpreted as a topic or emphatic marker. This is particularly the case with pa:
Ti
kai itni
kai
pa!
so
go
stand.IR go
there
‘Go then to stand over there!’
pa alone could be interpreted as emphatic marker.
Tu
awi
wayu
3pl take.R taro
‘They took that taro’ela
bepa
thereHere pa alone would be interpreted as givenness marker.
There is also a more lexicalized construction ha-pa /ha-ti which is usually pronounced as one
word. It is used only when introducing new non-topical referents into the text, usually inanimate
instruments or objects. Its function is to show that the instrument or object was already at hand or
near by when the action started.

In Urim, most conjunctions and conjunctive forms are clause initial. Some, however, are clause
final, and some are discontinuous. Many conjunctions operate on more than one level. For example,
the conjunctions a ‘and’, aki ‘or’ and kol ‘if, like’ can connect phrases, clauses, or sentences. Some
conjunctions, like atnen ‘because of’ and eng ‘therefore, so that’ govern embedded adverbial clauses,
but never connect independent sentences. Some conjunctions connect only clauses (pipa, titan), while
many connect both clauses and sentences (pa, atom etc.). In Urim there are following conjunctions.
Coordinating conjunctions:102a (sometimes wa after words ending in a vowel)
wa.....wa
aki
ari
pake‘and’‘and....again/also/further’
‘or’
‘but’
‘but’
(combination of pa ‘that’ + ise ‘PERF’ ---> pa-ke)Coordinating or weakly subordinating, temporal or expressing continuity:
... plalng, .... plalng pa, ... plalng pipa ‘after that, (when that had happened or finished)’
....titan, ....ninan
‘after that (a longer happening or action
finished)
am
‘now, then’ (immediately) (basically time word
‘now’)
atom
‘then, and’
Subordinating conjunctions:
- causative and conditional:
pa
‘when’
... pa,
‘when, if’
pipa
‘if’ (combination of pa +pa ---> pipa)
.... pipa,/pilpa, ‘when’, if
pati
‘so then’ (combination of pa +ti- ‘this’ --> pati)
....pati
‘what comes to that’
(kolpa) atom ‘so, therefore (often past)’
(kolpa) ti
‘this is why, therefore (often future)’
kolpa
‘therefore, being like that, like that (before quotation)’ (combination of kol ‘like’ +
pa
‘that’)
-hypothetical:kol / kolen
kol ... pa / kol ... pipa/pilpa
-‘if’
‘if’(also comparative ‘like’)expressing reason:eng
eng ntei‘so that, therefore’
‘therefore’(also preposition: Benefactive, Goal, Purpose etc.)
(originally interrogative pronoun ‘why?’)103
atnen‘therefore, because of’ (also preposition and verb ‘wait for, watch)- semantically neutral:
la ti
la‘what about’
‘that’(starts a new topic, from the verb la ‘speak’)
(semantically neutral complementizer governing the clausal
object of certain verbs)As is the case in many other languages, in Urim a number of the conjunctions appear to be built
out of demonstratives. The commonest conjunction in Urim, pa, is a near demonstrative ‘that’. This
demonstrative occurs also as part of conjunctions pake, pipa, pilpa, kolpa and pati. Three
conjunctions, kol, eng, and atnen a transparently related to prepositions. As well as taking nominal
complements, eng and atnen can also govern a clausal complement. Atnen is probably originally a
verb (there is a verb atnen ‘wait for, watch; hit). The conjunction ari ‘but’ is phonetically similar to
the verb ari ‘see’, but it is not clear whether or not this is an accidental resemblance. The verbs la
‘see’ and plalng ‘finish’ function as conjunctive forms too. The function of plalng as conjunction
resembles tail-head linkage which connects full sentences. Very much like conjunctions function the
words titan and nanan and reduplicated verb marking continuity. These words and reduplication
occur (often together) between clauses to show that the action described in the first clause continues
until the action of second clause starts. This structure and tail-head linkage are described in Chapters
5.5.7 and 5.7. Other conjunctions are described more fully in the Chapter 5. 5.
Examples of conjunctions:

Usually Urim conjunctions occur clause initially. Some conjunctions have two possible positions
between clauses, either at the end of the first clause before the pause, or after the pause starting the
second clause. This position seems to make the conjunction stronger, emphasize it, and sometimes is
also provides slightly different meaning compared to the initial position. In speech the conjunction
occurring clause finally usually gets prominent (high pitch - long vowel) intonation.

More rarely the conjunction in Urim may also occur inside the clause. In most cases the position
of conjunction in the middle of clause can be explained thematically. Fronting of object can move it
even to the front of conjunctions. This may be a feature of spoken language only.

Others:
o!
Wei!
Tsa!
E’e!compassion or surprise

2.12.1. The Problem of Word Boundaries in Urim
In Urim there are some difficulties in determining whether a construction is a compound word or
a phrase. Phonological criteria alone are not sufficient, because a grammatical phrase may
phonologically be one word, especially idioms. On the other hand, the boundaries of a phonological
word are not very clear in Urim. Many morphophonemic rules can be applied over a larger domain,
some apply over a more restricted domain than phonological word. Here we will briefly consider
various rules and other boundary marks that help to determine word boundaries in Urim.
a) Stress
Stress is the clearest mark of a phonological word in Urim. A phonological word can have only one
main stress in Urim, as indicated in the following examples:107
‘kol
like‘like this’‘ti
this‘only’‘kol#ti
like-this
‘wris
one‘only one’‘ata
onlyki’pman ‘wris#ata
man
one-only‘only men’ (not ‘only one man’!)‘yankipm#ok
talk-mouth‘talk’i’lkim
pit‘ok
mouth‘mouth of a pit’‘maur
spirit‘kanokg-en
ground-ATR‘a spirit living inside the ground’‘ka
grasshopper‘grasshopper sp.’‘maur#ka’nokg-en
spirit-ground-ATRHowever, stress is not very reliable in determining whether or not the construct is grammatically
one word, because two nouns or two verbs can be joined phonologically under one stress when no
modifiers occur in between:
‘door’‘wan#yun
house-door
‘wan

"Tracking participants and maintaining topics; anaphoraUrim speakers can refer back to known referents by using pronouns, zero-anaphora, or full noun
phrases. With noun phrases, the demonstrative pronoun pa usually occurs as a modifier in order to
mark of givenness of the referent:

‘We make sago. Cut the sago palm ... carried the sago-channel ...’If the referent is not particularly important and there can be only one such item at the certain point
of the story, no marker of definiteness or indefiniteness is necessarily used. Consider the following
examples:
Kil
no
minip,
kaino
3sg

‘He came upriver, went up along a creek.’
Ir

grab.Rkwokg
creek251
In the first example it is assumed that the river is the nearest one, and it is not really important
which creek he followed. In the second example the referent is known from the situation.
From the examples above one can see, that pa is more a marker of textual givenness rather than
just a general marker of giveness. Items known from the speech situation are referred to by NP + pa
usually only when there is a real meaning of distance.","[250, 251]"
"The use of pa with pronouns to mark changing topicWhen the deictic particle pa occurs with pronouns or other inherently definite noun phrasess, it
has special functions. It can be used to emphasize or clarify the referent, but usually its occurrence
with a pronoun marks a changing topic.
In Urim the same pronoun can occur in successive clauses referring to two different participants
without any occurrences of full noun phrases in between. This is possible, because the demonstrative
pa can also be used with pronouns to indicate a changing referent.

3sg make.R like-that body G-3sg
D

good
‘When he made this way, he felt releaved.’
(the use of pa marks that the pronouns refer to different persons)
In following examples, pa is used with pronouns or generic nouns to mark changing actor-topic:
Kupm pa ake

D say-say‘We came landed here at Wewak, she broke an egg and we ate ... But I said, ... We kept
travelling and I asked her now, ... And she said, ...’
The use of pa is not automatic with a change of Subject. Its use seems to require that the referent
of the pronoun will persist as the Subject in more than just one sentence; i.e.topicality governs this use252
of pa. In the last example, the pronouns kil ‘he’ and kupm ‘I’ are without pa in spite of the fact that
they represent changing actor. The reason why pa never occurs with plural pronouns in this example
might be, that since ‘we’ includes both actors, the topic is not really viewed as changing. Notice also
that Object pronouns can be marked by pa when its referent occurs as actor-topic in the next sentence.
In the following example, the pronominalized Object is marked as topical by using pa, before the
referent occurs as subject:
Atom
kupm la

"1725. Complex sentences
Usually three types of subordinate clauses are distinguished in languages: those which function as
arguments of the predicate (i.e. complements), those which function as modifiers of nouns (relative
clauses), and those which function as modifiers of verb phrases or entire propositions (adverbial
clauses). (Thompson and Longacre, 171). We can find these clause types also in Urim, although with
adverbial clauses it is difficult to distinguish between subordinated adverbial clauses and more
coordinate combinations of clauses. Therefore we conflate the description of adverbial clauses and
coordinate combinations of sentences.","[171, 172]"
