When the arguments of a transitive verb are expressed with independent words
(rather than being indicated only on the pronominal suffixes on the verb), the word order
is predominantly SOV. OSV order is possible, but is used only when the subject is in
focus.11 For example, (5.56) and (5.57) are the same with respect to who loves whom,
but (5.56) uses a word order that is neutral as to information structure, whereas (5.57)
places focus on lat’o ‘[Lat’o (NOM.F)]’.(5.56) lat’o

bat-t’-anno.
Lat’o(NOM.F)

‘Lat’o loves Dangura.’ (pitch accent: lat’o danura bat-t’-anno.)

Dangura(ACC)

like-3SG.F-IMPRF.3
‘Lat’o loves Dangura.’ (pitch accent: danura lat’o bat-t’-anno.)
(It is no one but Lat’o who loves Dangura.)
5.2.2 Structure of Noun Phrases
In Sidaama, an adnominal constituent precedes the head noun that it modifies. An
attributive adjective comes before the head noun, as in (5.58).","[531, 532]"

construction is flexible. The order of subject NP–dative NP–object NP–verb in (5.193)
can be changed to, for example, object NP–dative NP–subject NP–verb, as in (5.196), or
subject NP–object NP–dative NP–verb, as in (5.197).",[601]

‘His father is tall for her.’ (His father is tall in her judgment.)
As mentioned above, the order of constituents other than the verb in the judicantis
construction is flexible, as in the benefactive construction. (5.203’) and (5.204’), whose
word order is different from (5.203) and (5.204), are grammatical.","[605, 606]"

information, but also carry information about the number and person of the subject.
Finally, the person/number of the subject (1SG, 3SG.M: -ø, 3SG.F/3PL: -t, 1PL:
-n) is indicated before the optative mood suffix -o (Table 4.14) (-ø for 3SG.M is assumed- 478 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 479to show contrast with -t for 3SG.F/3PL and -n for 1PL, which precedes the optative
suffixes).42
The order of the person/number–aspect suffixes for the third-person singular and
the second-person plural and the order of the person/number–optative suffixes seem to be
counterexamples to Bybee’s (1985: 34-35) findings about the very common
crosslinguistic patterns of positioning of verb inflections. Bybee looked into the
positions of verb inflections for aspect, tense, mood, and person (usually, person and
number) in relation to the verb stem in a sample of 50 genetically and geographically
diverse languages chosen by Perkins (1980), and found the following tendency: verb
stem – aspect – tense – mood – person/number (in the case of suffixing languages).
Bybee examined the ordering relationship of each pair of inflections: (a) aspect – tense,
(b) aspect – mood, (c) aspect – person, (d) tense – mood, (e) tense – person, and (f) mood
– person. The relations relevant to Sidaama are (c) aspect – person and (f) mood –
person, because this language lacks tense. Furthermore, aspect and mood markers do not
co-occur. According to Bybee, aspect markers occur closer to the verb stem than person
markers in 12 out of 21 languages that have both categories with only one
counterexample (Navaho). However, the aspect and person markers in Sidaama show the
opposite order when the subject is the third-person singular or second-person plural,
though Sidaama exhibits the predicted pattern when the subject is the first-person or
second-person singular. Bybee also found that mood markers occur closer to the verb
stem than person markers in 13 out of 26 languages that have both categories (with five42The suffix for the other mood category, the imperative suffix, is fused with the person/number
information and the suffix that indicates the two categories is difficult to separate into distinct markers.","[499, 500]"

Professor Jürgen BohnemeyeriiiDedicated to my family,
especially my wife and childrenivAck nowled gmentsFirst of all, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Dr. Abebayehu Aemero
Tekleselassie (PhD in educational administration), my Sidaama native speaker consultant
and teacher (from the Baansa district of the Sidaama zone in Southern Ethiopia), who has
provided me with data constantly over the years. He and I have had approximately one
thousand hours of consultation sessions so far. I owe most parts of my dissertation to his
friendship, his encouragement, and his patience as well as his Sidaama data and his
insightful comments on them. If I had not met him at the party for the Field Methods
class in Buffalo in 2001, I would not be able to be working on Sidaama, nor would I have
been able to write this dissertation.
Before I started to study Sidaama, I had worked on several different languages
(excluding English and Japanese) with their native speakers, hoping that I might be
inspired enough by one of those languages to write a dissertation. However, for various
reasons unique to each language, I could not continue to work on any one of them long
enough to generate a dissertation topic. After repeating the mistake of studying a
language halfway and saying good-bye to its speaker(s) several times, I was at a loss for
what to do for dissertation research. At that time, Dr. Abebayehu rescued me from
abandoning the idea of working on a language other than English and Japanese, by giving
me the chance to study Sidaama.
I am lucky enough to have been able to work closely with a person like Dr.
Abebayehu for a long time. He and I were only two floors away in the same building for
several years. He has always been cooperative, letting me ask him about Sidaama notvonly in my office and in our houses, but anywhere, including for example, at Tops
Supermarket at University Plaza, in my car, at the Buffalo Airport, and in one of the
surgery waiting rooms at Kenmore Mercy Hospital, he is always willing to make time for
my questions. He is very tough, and we have usually had a couple of two-hour sessions a
week, sometimes even a several hours’ session in a day. I don’t know how I can thank
him.
I would also like to express my profound thanks to my advisors for their
mentorship. I am very much honored to have been able to be one of their students. My
primary advisor, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, constantly gave me professional comments
and advice on my dissertation. Without him, I would never have been able to complete
my dissertation so fast. Professor Leonard Talmy gave me much advice and insightful
comments on my work over the long years. His every word has always executed a great
influence on me. I would also like to convey my sincere thanks to Professor Jürgen
Bohnemeyer for his constructively critical, detailed written comments and very
encouraging verbal comments on this study.
My gratitude goes to other professors in the Department of Linguistics at the
University at Buffalo for training me as a linguist, especially, Professor Karin Michelson
(who helped me decide on writing on Sidaama), Professor Jean-Pierre Koenig (who
always gave me encouraging advice), Professor Jeri Jaeger (who taught me basic
linguistic analyses and academic writing), Professor Wolfgang Wölck (who gave me
words of cheer and various delicious drinks), Professor David Zubin, Professor Robert
Van Valin, Professor Mitsuaki Shimojo, Professor Roger Woodard, and Professor
Colleen Fitzgerald. I would also like to mention that I gained tremendous benefit fromvithe Field Methods classes, which I took for three years straight here in Buffalo, and
learned very useful fundamental techniques of the elicitation of linguistic data from
Professor Karin Michelson, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, and Professor Colleen
Fitzgerald.
My special thanks go to Professor Norimitsu Tosu, my former advisor at Keio
University, for his continuous encouragement. If I had not studied linguistics under his
instruction, I would not be pursuing this discipline now. I am also indebted to Mr.
Makoto Ebihara, my ex-teacher at Keio Boys’ Senior High School, for directing my
interest to linguistic investigation in my younger days.
There are also many colleagues of mine who I would like to thank. First, Justin
Boffemmyer has read my entire dissertation and given me numerous helpful comments. I
would also like to express my thanks to my officemates, Valeria Belloro, Christopher
Phipps, and Rodrigo Romero-Mendez, for various discussions, and to my other
colleagues who gave linguistic and/or editorial comments on or who had discussion with
me about portions of my dissertation, especially, Justin Boffemmyer, Jerry Bove, Jennifer
Cornish, Ed Escott, Lilian Guerrero, Paul Heider, Sang-gu Kang, Heike Lehnert
LeHouillier, Atsuko Nishiyama, Luis Paris, Yukiko Sugiyama, Khaled Albahri, Yongeun
Lee (Northwestern), and Ichiro Yuhara (Chicago) (their titles are omitted).
My gratitude also goes to Carole Orsolits (Linguistics Department) and Heike
Jones (Center for Cognitive Science) for providing office space to work out of. I have
been able to collect data very efficiently thanks to this space.viiThanks also go to the Mark Diamond Research Fund, the College of Arts and
Sciences dissertation fellowship, and the Department of Linguistics summer research
grants at the University at Buffalo for partial support of the present study.
Saving the most important for last, I would like to convey many thanks to my
family, especially, my wife, children, and parents, for their support and patience. I
apologize for all the great inconvenience that I have caused (and am still causing) to them
because of the studies that I have been conducting over such a long period of time
without sparing much or any time for them and without earning any income. I will do my
best to compensate for this after I go back home.
Finally, please let me make an excuse. I would like the reader to be generous
enough to take my dissertation as a rough draft of my improved future work. Even
though my consultant is superb, I might have made some errors. Also, even though my
brilliant advisors have given me helpful advice, there are many portions that I have not
been able to revise. I have to submit this as my dissertation to the Graduate School now,
because of the deadline (coming in a few minutes!) set by a newly created rule. I hope
that I will be able to revise it as soon as possible. Maganu oohe! in advance again, Dr.
Abebayehu!viiiTab le of Conten ts

East Cushitic language spoken in the south-central part of Ethiopia. Sidaama is spoken
by over 1,800,000 people, but there has been relatively little research on the language.
Chapter 1 (introduction) gives background information on the Sidaama language
and the Sidaama people, briefly reviews previous studies, and discusses the methodology
used in the present study.
Chapters 2-5 use basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe
the phonology and morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event
integration patterns (Talmy 1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this
language.
Chapter 2 (phonology) lists the phonemes, the consonant clusters, and the
geminates, describes suprasegmentals (syllables and moras, pitch accent, intonation, and
pause), and presents morphophonemic rules.
Chapter 3 (parts of speech) describes characteristics of parts of speech. The
topics discussed in this chapter include types of nouns and verbs, similarities between
adjectives and nouns and between adjectives and verbs, various pronominal forms, and
clitics.
Chapter 4 (morphology) discusses reduplication of verb roots, suprafixes on
nouns and adjectives, and suffixes on nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It also examines the
ordering relationship of the suffixes.xviiChapter 5 (syntax) discusses four topics on the syntax of Sidaama. The first
section looks into grammatical relations in terms of how they are coded and in what
constructions they occur. The second topic of Chapter 5 is word order. The third section
of Chapter 5 discusses two types of external possessor construction, the oblique
possessum external possessor construction and the dative possessor external possessor
construction. The fourth section examines the structures of relative clauses and the types
of elements that can be relativized.
Chapter 6 (semantics) examines the semantic structure of Sidaama, which shows
characteristics of a verb-framed language, in terms of how it expresses different types of
events, using Talmy’s (1985, 1991, 2000b) typological framework of event integration.
It investigates how the schematic and the non-schematic components of the five types of
events (motion, state change, realization, temporal contouring, and action correlating)
appear morphosyntactically in this language.xviiiAbb reviat ions

grammatical structure of Sidaama, a Cushitic language of Ethiopia. Chapters 2-5 use
basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe the phonology and
morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event integration patterns (Talmy
1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this language.
This chapter is organized as follows.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"
"Most of the properties of the EPC that were used in section 5.3.1.1 to show that the
possessor NP and the possessum NP are separate constituents apply to this construction
as well, though the pronominal object suffix that refers to an animate possessor cannot be
used in this construction because it ends in the predicative noun-phrase clitic, rather than
a verb. First, the two NPs are pronounced with different intonation contours. Second,
another constituent can occur between them. For example, an adverb like t’a ‘now’ can
be inserted between the subject NP and the dative NP (e.g., ise t’a hakko manc-i-ra
darawo=te. ‘She is a friend of that man now.’). Third, the order of the possessor NP and
the possessum NP can be reversed, e.g., (5.254’) instead of (5.251) (repeated below as
(5.254)).",[629]
"Second, as shown in (5.262), the existential verb can be
- 613 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 614accompanied by the pronominal object suffix (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.6, section
5.1.1.2) that refers to an animate possessor. Third, another constituent can intervene
between the two NPs. For example, an adverbial such as t’a ‘now’ can occur between the
dative NP and the subject NP (e.g., damboow-i-ra t’a bun-u no. ‘Damboowa has coffee
now.’). Fourth, though the order of dative NP–subject NP is usually used, it can
sometimes be inverted.","[634, 635]"

‘His father is tall for her.’ (His father is tall in her judgment.)Thus, the benefactive construction with a transitive verb and the judicantis
construction can each be identical in structure with the Dative EPC with a transitive verb
predicate or with an intransitive verb or adjective predicate, respectively, as shown in
(5.205). As discussed above, the order of the constituents other than the predicate in the- 585 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 586benefactive and judicantis constructions is flexible. Also in the Dative EPC, the order of
the NPs is flexible, though the dative NP normally precedes the patient/theme NP.(5.205) a.benefactive DAT (with a transitive verb):

(=possessum)intrans.V or AdjThere are two additional respects in which the benefactive construction with a transitive
verb and the judicantis construction show structural similarities with the Dative EPC.
First, just as the pronominal object suffix that refers to the possessor can occur on the
verb in a Dative EPC that uses a verb, the pronominal object suffix that refers to the
dative entity can attach to the verb in a benefactive construction with a transitive verb or
in the judicantis construction. Examples are shown in (5.206) and (5.207).","[606, 607]"

sibling=NPC.PRED.MODThus, eerco acts as an adjective in (3.145) and (3.146) — although it constitutes an NP
with the preceding adnominal demonstrative, the use of the suffix -u rather than -i on it
for the nominative case and the genitive case, respectively, suggests that it is not
modified by the adnominal demonstrative. In (3.139), it acts as a noun — it does not
behave as an adjective here because the use of the genitive suffix -i rather than -u on it
indicates that it is modified by the preceding adnominal demonstrative. Unlike the words
in (3.130b) including eerco, which have uses both as adjectives and as nouns, those in
(3.130c) including seeda are basically adjectives, and cannot be used as nouns.
As shown so far, words that refer to a person’s property or ability or a person with
that property or ability can be used as adjectives, as nouns, or like nouns. These can be
classified into three types depending on whether they exhibit more noun-like or adjectivelike properties. The difference between the three types of words often emerges as a
difference in their order when they modify the same noun in the same NP. Although
multiple adjectives only infrequently occur as modifiers of the same noun, if they do, the
following ordering rule roughly applies: a pure adjective in (3.130c), which cannot be- 157 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 158used as a noun, comes before a word in (3.130b) that can be used as either an adjective or
a noun, as in (3.149) (*eerc-u seed-u manc-i da-ø-i.), which in turn precedes a noun for
a person’s occupation in (3.130a), as in (3.150) (*isi oeessa eerco manco-ti.).","[178, 179]"

4.2.3 Order of the Suffixes
Any Sidaama word follows the order of root–derivational suffixes–inflectional
suffixes when it contains both types of suffixes (Greenberg 1963: 93. Universal 28). The
ordering relationships of the noun suffixes, the adjective suffixes, and the verb suffixes
are each described below.","[470, 471]"
"4.2.3.1 Order of Noun Suffixes
The noun suffixes have the ordering relationships shown in (4.285).",[471]
"• Livelihood and everyday life
In the Sidaama zone, there is a strong bond among the members of local
communities, and what unites them seems to be an interdependency between them
(Brøgger 1986), among others, between young and old people, and between women and
men.
The Sidaama society is gerontocratic (Brøgger 1986, Hamer 1970, 1987, 2003),
and children are educated by their parents to respect elders. It has a generational class
system called luwa, which is, according to Hamer (2003: 196), “a means for articulating
and perpetuating a relationship between youth and their elders”, specifically, “a means by
which the former provide deference and labor for the elders in return for patrimony and
instruction from the latter”. The Sidaama zone is composed of different clans (a’re),
and they are in turn divided into a few more layers of social organizations (e.g., bosello
‘subclan’). When there is a problem at one level of social organization, a council of
elders (songo) at that level is called to discuss and solve the problem.
In Sidaama culture, the division of labor between women and men is rigidly
defined (Brøgger 1986, Hamer 1987), and women and men are responsible for different
sets of cooperative duties; there are also those jobs for which children are usually- 15 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 1: Introduction 16responsible.12 According to my consultant, (1.2a) are women’s duties, (1.2b) are men’s,

coffee, corn, wheat, barley, sugar cane, and various kinds of vegetables and fruits
(cabbages, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, beans and peas, oranges,12When its order is arbitrary, gender is presented in the order in accordance with the following rules: (i)
for words such as women and men and female and male, the odd-numbered chapters follow the femininemasculine order, and the even-numbered chapters the opposite order; (ii) “s/he” is used as a gender-neutral,
singular pronoun in the nominative case, and “his/her” and “him/her” are used as gender-neutral, singular
pronouns in the genitive case and accusative case, respectively. Because the consultant and the author are
both male, most examples that contain the first-person and second-person singular pronouns are those for
masculine referents.
13As discussed in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.1.3.3) and Kawachi (2004), the middle voice suffix can show that
the action is performed as one of the subject’s social responsibilities. The subject performs an action which
he/she is expected to carry out regularly or on a particular occasion as one of his/her responsibilities in
his/her family or community, and whose non-execution would get other family or community members into
trouble and make himself/herself feel guilty. The verbs in (1.2) are often accompanied by the middle voice
suffix to convey such a nuance.","[36, 37]"

"5.1 Grammatical Relations
Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language, which uses subject and object,
rather than ergative and absolutive. The core grammatical relations relevant to Sidaama
are subject, direct object, and indirect object. For ditransitive verbs (u- ‘to give’, hir- ‘to
buy (for someone), sell’, kul- ‘to tell’, aris- ‘to lend’, leell-i-s- [appear-EP-CAUS] ‘to
show’), Sidaama makes a distinction between direct objects and indirect objects.
Following Van Valin (2001), who makes a distinction between the coding
properties (verb agreement, case marking, the position of an argument in the clause) and
behavioral properties of grammatical relations (the types of constructions where
constituents in each of the grammatical relations characteristically occur), this section
looks into these two types of properties of grammatical relations in Sidaama.",[502]

possessor of a subject in (5.93), a direct object in (5.94), the possessor of a direct object
in (5.95), an indirect object in (5.96), and an oblique in (5.97).1414(5.92) is an example of the dative external possessor construction, and (5.97) is an example of the
oblique possessum external possessor construction (section 5.3; Kawachi 2006a, 2007b).",[547]
"Thus, a co-event needs to be mentioned to convey the upshot of the whole event. In other
words, the existence of a co-event is required in these event categories. As an obligatory
used constituent, a verb may be used for this purpose. If a verb is employed for the coevent, a non-verbal constituent can appear to express the framing event. An S-language
can do this easily with a satellite. On the other hand, a V-language may have to express
the framing event with an adverbial or V1 of a multi-verb construction, and deviate from
the prototypical V-language pattern.",[832]

there are those verb suffixes whose final vowel segments are always accented (or which
constitute the final vowel segments of words by themselves and are always accented).
Such suffixes include: simple perfect (3SG.M: -i, 3SG.F/3PL: -u, 2PL: -i), present perfect
(3: -ino, 2PL: -oonni), imperfect (3: -anno, 2PL: -anni), and connective (-e: all
persons/numbers/genders) suffixes (Hudson 1976: 248). Thus, a verb with the third
person singular simple perfect suffix contrasts with a verb with the second-person
singular imperative suffix, as in (2.52) and (2.53), and a verb with the third-person
singular present-perfect suffix contrasts with a verb with the first-person plural
imperative suffix, as in (2.54) and (2.55).(2.52) ha’r-ø-i.

Intonation toward the end of a sentence differentiates sentence types in Sidaama.
A Sidaama sentence normally ends in a suffixed verb or the predicating noun-phrase
clitic (=ho/=te or =ti). Non-WH-questions are usually only indicated by an intonation
pattern in the final or semi-final word of a sentence different from that in its declarative
counterpart (Greenberg 1963: universal 8).
In a declarative sentence ending in a suffixed verb, high pitch occurs on the
second to the last vowel segment of the word-final, main verb, and the pitch falls down at
its final vowel segment, which has low pitch, as long as the suffix has penultimate high
pitch accent.(2.56) ani

(3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), present perfect (3SG.M, 3SG.F/3PL, 2PL), imperfect

Sidaama often uses pauses to indicate constituent boundaries. When the sentence
has SOV word order, a pause usually occurs between the constituent boundaries (Teferra

an unmodified feminine common noun, and the genitive and nominative of a masculine
noun) and the person/number/gender of the subject can be indicated by the verb suffix
alone, rather than the subject being expressed as independent nouns or pronouns. For
example, each pair of sentences in (2.75) and (2.76), which look morphologically
identical, differ in the locations where pauses as well as high pitch accents are placed.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"

may occur. When two or more types of derivational suffixes co-occur, they roughly

"5.1.1.1 Case Marking
As mentioned earlier, Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language. Subjects are
in the nominative case, direct objects are in the accusative case, and indirect objects are
in the dative case. The following discussion shows how the grammatical relations are
coded by case marking on the heads of NPs (nouns or pronouns) (Chapter 3 section
3.2.1.1, Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3) and adnominal constituents (attributive adjectives or
adnominal demonstratives) (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.5, Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.2.1).
Nouns can be marked with case affixes, according to the patterns summarized in
Table 5.1 (see also Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3).",[503]

(2004), and Alemu and Tekleselassie (2006).
I have had consultation sessions with Abebayehu regularly (usually 2-6 hours a
week, sometimes longer or shorter) to collect Sidaama data. The consultations have been
conducted in English. We usually met in my office at the University at Buffalo, but,
since the late summer of 2005, when he left Buffalo, consultations have been done by
phone.
Admittedly, the use of a single consultant for a grammatical description cannot
take into account idiolectal or dialectal differences. Nevertheless, even when multiple
consultants on a language are employed, it would be difficult to ask all of them exactly
the same set of questions to write a grammar of the language; a bias toward the judgment
of even a small number of linguistic forms by a certain speaker or speakers out of a group
of consultants would be inevitable. The consultation with a single speaker makes it easy
to obtain consistent data. In order to benefit from this strength, I checked almost all the
examples in this dissertation with Abebayehu at least twice.","[46, 47]"

• Interrogative words in the predicate or pre-predicate position
Sidaama interrogative words (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.7), which can be pronouns,
adnominals, or adverbs, are sensitive to information structure, and occur most commonly
either in the predicate position or in the immediately pre-predicate position, though they
could also be analyzed as remaning in situ.
Generally, a constituent in the predicate position followed by the predicate form
of the noun-phrase clitic (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.1) provides new information. For
example, in (5.86) and (5.87), danura and hakko manco (or only hakko, depending on

Third, the suffix for the person/number of the subject and the infinitive suffix -a
co-occur before the dative marker -ra (section 4.2.2.3.4). This verb-suffix complex can- 475 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 476serve as a complement of a verb that expresses one person’s act of causing another
person to perform an action, as in (4.349) and (4.350), or can be used in other

There are other constructions where this verb-suffix complex occurs (see section
4.2.2.3.4).
The order of the suffix for the person/number of the subject and the infinitive
suffix -a depends on the person/number of the subject (Table 4.12). When the subject is
first-person or second-person singular, the infinitive suffix occurs right before the suffix
for the person/number of the subject, which is followed by the gender suffix (M: -o, F:
-a), as in (4.349): 1SG.M: -a-mm-o, 1SG.F: -a-mm-a, 2SG.M: -a-tt-o, 2SG.F: -a-tt-a.
When the subject is third-person singular or second-person plural, the suffix for the
person/number of the subject immediately precedes the infinitive suffix, as in (4.350):
3SG.M: -ø-a, 3SG.F/3PL: -t-a, 2PL: -tin-a (-ø in -ø-a for 3SG.M is assumed to show- 476 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 477contrast with -t in -t-a for 3SG.F/3PL). The first-person plural form is -n-a-mmo, in
which the infinitive suffix is between the two components of the first-person plural suffix
-n -mmo, which is a discontinuous morpheme. (This form could also be analyzed as a
sequence of the first-person plural suffix -n, the infinitive suffix -a, and the first-person
singular masculine suffix -mmo.)
Fourth, the suffix for the person/number of the subject occurs with the aspectual
suffix (following Teferra (2000: 80-81), the suffix complex that carries information about
the person/number of the subject and aspect is analyzed into components rather than
being treated as a portmanteau morpheme that simultaneously expresses the above
information). As already shown in Table 4.6, they follow the same pattern as the suffix
for the person/number of the subject and the infinitive suffix when they occur before the
dative suffix -ra. When the subject is the first-person or second-person singular, the
aspect suffix immediately precedes the suffix for the person/number of the subject, which
is followed by the gender suffix (M: -o, F: -a). Thus, the order is -ASPECT-PERSONGENDER. When the subject is the third-person singular or second-person plural, the
suffix for the person/number of the subject comes right before the infinitive suffix:
-PERSON-ASPECT (-ø for 3SG.M is assumed to show contrast with -t for 3SG.F/3PL,
which precedes any of the aspect suffixes). The first-person plural suffix is a disjunctive
morpheme made up of two components -n -mmo, between which the aspect suffix falls.
These are illustrated in Table 4.19 with the simple perfect forms of wi’l- ‘to cry’.","[496, 497, 498]"

In the passive construction in Sidaama (Chapter 4 section 4.2.1.3.3), only the NP
that would be a direct object in its active voice counterpart can be its subject, and the
indirect object in the active voice is not permitted to be the subject in the passive voice.
For example, the direct object of the active construction (5.51) (wot’e ‘money’) can be
8When the subject NP whose head is =hu has a masculine singular referent, it can be the subject of the
relative clause that it heads, even when the sentence is identical in structure to the “RC=hu ...=ti”
construction. For example, (i) and (ii) appear to be used in the form of the “RC=hu ...=ti” construction, but
are not. The NP headed by the clitic =hu has a masculine singular referent, and has to be the subject or
direct object of the relative clause.

5.2.3 Order of Other Types of Constituents• Standard — marker — adjective in a comparative
Sidaama shows the order standard-marker-quality (the order standard-markeradjective/verb) in comparative constructions. An NP used for the standard of comparison
is usually followed by the ablative suffix -nni (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3.6) to form a
comparative adjunct, and the adjective or verb that expresses the quality occurs in the
clause-final, predicate position. Examples are shown in (5.78) and (5.79). (5.78) shows
- 520 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 521the comparative construction that is used most commonly when the predicate is an
adjective or a state-change verb; the adverb roore ‘exceedingly’ or ale-nni ‘exceedingly’
(lit., ‘aboveness-LOC’) (or simply ale) can occur optionally between the comparative
adjunct and the predicate for the quality. For an action verb predicate, the causative form
of the verb roor- ‘to exceed’, rather than the adverb roore, which is used as a subordinate
verb with the connective suffix, occurs between the comparative adjunct and the
predicate, as in (5.79).(5.78) bule

• Verb — tense/aspect auxiliary verb
There are two verbs that serve as aspect auxiliary verbs: the existential verb (lit.,
‘to come to exist, come to be located’) (no for a third-person subject) and the verb for ‘to
live’ hee- (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.1). The existential verb is always in one of its
present perfect forms, and does not have any other aspect forms; it cannot occur with the
infinitive suffix or the connective suffix. It can follow a content verb to constitute the
present-progressive form of the verb with the infinitive form of that verb followed by the
manner/concomitance suffix -nni, as in (5.81), or the present continuous verb form with
the connective form of another verb, as in (5.82).(5.81) insa

this way, hee- is always in the third-person singular simple perfect (hee’r-ø-i [live3SG.M-S.PRF.3SG.M]), regardless of the person and number of the subject; it follows a
verb in the present perfect or in the imperfect, whose suffix has information on the person

‘He slid the pen between books.’256.2.3.2 Expressions of Motion Events with Multi-Verb Constructions
The discussion so far has dealt with cases where a Motion event consisting only
of a framing event is expressed with a single verb. The present section looks into cases
where Motion events are expressed by multi-verb constructions (section 6.2.2). Sidaama
seems to follow the prototypical V-language pattern of expressing Motion events to a
large degree, though there are exceptions discussed later.
As is characteristic of V-languages, Sidaama often expresses co-events with V1
and Paths with the V2 in one of the V1-V2 constructions. A pair of examples is shown in
(6.88). (6.88a) is an example of the temporal sequence construction with the connective
suffix, and (6.88b) is an example of the manner/concomitance construction with the
infinitive suffix and the suffix -nni. (There is almost no clear difference between (6.88a)
and (6.88b), except that the manner of running is more emphasized in (6.88b) than in
(6.88a).)25As in (6.87), surk- can be followed by the Path verb ee-ss- ‘to put in’ or wor- ‘to put’ in the temporal
sequence constructions, but the order of the two types of verbs cannot be reversed in this construction, as in
(i).

but the use of each construction depends on the type of the co-event. The present section
examines how different types of support relations of a co-event to a framing event of
Motion appear as V1 of the V1-V2 constructions depicting Motion events, and shows the
following: (i) for the types of support relations of a co-event that have to precede the
framing event, Precursion and Enablement, only the temporal sequence construction can
be used; on the other hand, for Subsequence, which has to occur after the framing event,
none of the V1-V2 constructions can be used; (ii) for Cause, usually the temporal
sequence construction is used, though the extended causation construction may be used
when the causation can be interpreted as extended causation; (iii) for Concomitance, the
manner/concomitance construction is usually used when the co-event of Concomitance
expressed by V1 is normally an unbounded action, as is generally the case, but the
temporal sequence construction can be used when V1 is a state-change verb; (iv) for
- 745 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 746Manner, as mentioned above, either the temporal sequence or manner/concomitance
construction can be used with almost no difference in meaning. Manner seems to have a
special status in that it can often be expressed by the V1 of two V1-V2 constructions
interchangeably.
Out of the several types of co-events, one of them, the co-event of Subsequence,
which is preceded by the framing event, cannot use any of the V1-V2 constructions. For
example, a subtype of Subsequence, Purpose, is expressed by ‘in order to do ...’ (Chapter
4 section 4.2.2.3.4) or ‘so that’ (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.8), as in (6.89) and (6.90).(6.89) milli

A second condition concerns the subject’s belief or judgment. In order for a
clause with the form of a dative construction to be interpreted as the Dative EPC, the
speaker has to believe that the dative entity is affected by the event either beneficially or
adversely. Thus, the Dative EPC takes the speaker’s, rather than the subject’s or the
dative entity’s, perspective.

This section describes affixes in Sidaama, first discussing derivational suffixes
(section 4.2.1; derivational noun suffixes, derivational adjective suffixes, derivational
verb suffixes) and then inflectional affixes (section 4.2.2; inflectional noun affixes,
inflectional adjective affixes, inflectional verb suffixes). Section 4.2.3 examines the
ordering relationships of the suffixes.",[334]

subject NP in many cases.
46The use of the word for ‘head’ seems to be widespread across languages (Schachter 1985: 28). Such
languages include not only languages distantly related and geographically close to Sidaama (e.g., Amharic)
but those both genetically and geographically distant from it (e.g., Fula [Schachter 1985: 28]). On the other
hand, there are Cushitic languages that use words other than ‘head’ (e.g., ‘bone’ in Somali; Schladt 2000:
122).",[205]

5.1.2.1.4 Cleft Construction (a construction that excludes the subject)
There is one construction that excludes the subject and allows the direct object,
the indirect object, and non-arguments. It is the cleft construction “RC=hu ...=ti”, whose
subject is the nominative singular masculine noun-phrase clitic, =hu (Chapter 3 section
3.2.2.1), modified by a relative clause, and whose predicate is a focused NP or adverbial
ending in the predicating noun-phrase clitic =ti. Note that the head of the relative clause
in this construction is =hu regardless of the gender of the head noun of the clefted NP or
the noun (if there is one) in the clefted adverbial. Examples are shown in (5.39)-(5.46).
As in (5.39)-(5.42), the constituent extracted from the relative clause in this construction
may be the direct or indirect object of the relative clause. The (a) examples use feminine
nouns and the (b) examples use masculine nouns. In (5.39)-(5.41), the clefted NP is the
direct object of the relative clause. In (5.42), the clefted NP is the indirect object of the
relative clause.","[523, 524]"

suffix -t or /t/ of the second-person plural suffix -tin) to a stem-final obstruent
When a verb root with an obstruent (a single obstruent, not part of a consonant
cluster or geminate) at its end is followed by a /t/-initial suffix, the /t/ becomes totally
assimilated with the obstruent and forms a geminate with it, in order to avoid a sequence
of two different obstruents (Hudson 1976: 250, Abebe Gebre-Tsadik 1985: 73).","[71, 72]"

In order to show the fulfillment of the agent’s intention, which is not implied by a verb,
this verb is usually used as V1 of the temporal sequence V1-V2 construction and is
followed by another verb, V2, which expresses the framing event of fulfillment, as in

Note that the pronominal object suffix on the verb of the RC does not always refer
to the head of the RC. When the head of an RC is its subject, and the pronominal object
suffix is used on the verb of the RC, it refers not to the subject, but to a constituent in the
RC (usually, a primary object), or its referent may not be mentioned anywhere in the
sentence. For example, in (5.329), the pronominal object suffix -se refers to the direct
object of the verb of the RC, lat’o, if it is mentioned, and refers to a third-person singular
feminine person who does not appear anywhere else in the sentence if lat’o is not
mentioned.",[695]
