4.4.1RP functions and constituent orderIn addition to the predicate, a clause can (but need not) contain referring expressions that function
as subjects and objects, or in oblique roles. Referring expressions are expressed syntactically as
referring phrases (RPs) (§4.5). The predicate usually comes first in the clause followed by the
core (i.e. subject and object) RPs in either order. There is no case-marking or other overt means
of indicating which RP is subject, and which is object.

Example (168) contains the possessive clitic <F`ji, which here indicates that the grammatical
subject is the possessor of the single argument of the intransitive predicate head (S) cTvhprt
‘father’; the possessed S argument is syntactically an oblique. The first person possessor in (168)
is hence the subject and the second person participant, the S of cTvhprt ‘(be) father’, is oblique.
Significantly, the same Indicative pronominal clitic is used as in the preceding first person singular acting on second person singular transitive example (167).

Eschewing the details, arguments can be given to show that (168) is, in fact, intransitive; that is,
we are not dealing with a transitive construction like ‘you (are) father (to) me’.
In Nuuchahnulth, the first word in a mood-marked predicate hosts a mood clitic followed directly by a pronominal clitic that expresses the person and number of the subject:
(169)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Q`G
mtmTj<""`Q<(l)@<`G
sing=TEMP=INDIC=1sg‘I am singing.’
Third person, however, is unmarked by a pronominal clitic –– the absence of a pronominal clitic
indicates third person. In some cases the mood clitic shows slight formal peculiarities when not
followed by a first or second person clitic that could be said to mark third person, but third person
has no clitic of its own:102(170)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Ql`
mtmTj<""`Q<l@
sing=TEMP=INDIC‘He/she/it/they are singing.’
The Nuuchahnulth pronominal subject clitics fall into several sets of forms depending on the preceding mood clitic (§7.2.2), e.g. the Indicative mood clitic in (169) and (170) <(l)@ (or <l@
with no following pronominal clitic) is followed by a set in which first person singular is indicated by <`G.
Unlike Makah, Nuuchahnulth does not mark non-subjects in the clitic sequence under most
circumstances. However, first person non-subjects are marked in imperative moods (§7.2.20),
and, very rarely, in the Indicative (§7.2.4).
Southern Wakashan mood clitics express a varied set of modal, evidential, and speech-act
categories. Most of these are in paradigmatic opposition, but a few may co-occur to form mood
combinations (§7.2.3). Mood clitics include the Indicative illustrated above for both languages,
the Purposive M, N <""`9 ‘in order that’, interrogative moods used to form both yes/no and content questions, the Conditional M <pdx(t), N <pt9 ‘if, when; would’, the Nuuchahnulth Dubitative <p@E` ‘perhaps’, and the Subordinate M <W, <p`9, N <p@, which forms that-clause
complements of predicates of saying, thinking, etc. as well as causal (‘because’) clauses, and, in
Makah, ‘when’ clauses (in conjunction with Ftxt ‘when’). There are also several evidential
moods in both languages, including the Quotative M <v`9s, <v`9c`, N <vDFhm and inferential moods. The Makah Relative <(p)hj, <(p)h and Nuuchahnulth Definite Relative <FHsp and
Indefinite Relative <(x)h9 moods form relative clauses. See Chapter 7 for more on the form and
function of these and other mood clitics.
Predicates without mood marking are often called “absolute” or “absolutive” in the Southern
Wakashan descriptive literature (e.g. Sapir 1924: 82, note 1, Rose 1981: 213, Jacobsen 1979a,
1993). It is necessary to recognize two types of absolute predicates: subject-marked absolutes and103non-subject-marked absolutes, which I henceforth refer to as “bare absolutes”. Bare absolutes
occur only as same-subject juxtaposed predicates in the common sentence-building construction
described in §4.5, or as complements of certain complement-taking words (§4.6.2.1). Subjectmarked absolutes typically occur in narrative contexts where the mood has been previously established in the discourse by a preceding mood-marked predicate.
Pronominal subjects in subject-marked absolute predicates are marked on the first word of the
predicate by a set of pronominal clitics, which, in Makah, has no form indicating third person
singular, and, in Nuuchahnulth, has no form indicating third person whatsoever. Bare absolute
predicates (by definition) have no subject marking. This means that a third person subject-marked
absolute is overtly indistinguishable from a bare absolute. For example, in the Makah sentences in
(171), compare the third person singular subject-marked absolute in (171)a with the two predicates in (171)b, the first of which is the third person singular subject-marked absolute matrix
predicate vhJ`Q ‘He/she/it did, were not’, and the second, g`FtjRhQ ‘eat’, a bare absolute functioning as complement to vhJ`Q.

The three predicates are superficially identical with respect to subject marking. However, it is
easy enough to tell them apart as long as we keep in mind the structural difference between a zero
form and nothing, that is, a form where a decision between paradigmatic options has resulted in a
marker that happens to be zero versus a form in which no marking can ever occur. This distinction clearly emerges when the sentences are put in first person:104(172)MAKAHa. g`FtjRF`Qrh

not=TEMP=1sg[eat–PERF]‘I didn’t eat.’
(172) c. )vhJ`Qrh [g`FtjRhQrH]
The subject-marked absolute predicates in (172)a-b are now marked with the first person singular
clitic <rh9. The bare absolute complement to vhJ`Qrh in (172)b remains without the subject clitic, and, as (172)c shows, the sentence becomes ungrammatical (with this meaning) if it is added.
(172)c is a grammatical string, but only if it is interpreted as two successive subject-marked absolutes (‘I didn’t do it; I ate’), where the speaker asserts that he did eat, but didn’t do something
else. In this dissertation, predicates in constructed sentence examples are usually marked with
Indicative mood (the unmarked mood for conversation), but examples cited from texts are frequently subject-marked absolutes. See, for example, (176)e-f, (178)b, (179)c etc. below. Presented with a subject-marked absolute out of context, Makah speakers typically “correct” it to a
mood-marked predicate.
4.3.2TenseSentences with no overt tense marking are, strictly speaking, non-future, that is, they are interpreted as having either past or present time reference, according to context. Non-tense-marked
predicates in isolated elicitation sentences are invariably interpreted as having present time reference in Makah (unless they are perfective –– see below), and I suspect in Nuuchahnulth also. In
both languages, however, one frequently finds non-tense-marked predicates with past time reference in narrative discourse. Past and future tense clitics in the predicate indicate time reference105relative to that already established in the discourse. For example, the past tense clitic M <(a)hs,
N <(l)hs is a relative past marker in that it indicates time reference prior to the discourseestablished time reference rather than absolute past time reference.
(173)NUUCHAHNULTHmtmTJi`Qhsrh
mtmTj<""`Q<(l)hs<rH
sing=TEMP=PAST=1sg‘I was, had been singing.’
It is worth pointing out here that tense and aspect are entirely distinct formal systems in Southern
Wakashan. Tense is marked by clitics, while aspect is marked by suffixes, reduplication, or length
changes in base vowels (§4.2.3). However, past temporal reference is strongly implied by perfective aspect, which is usually incompatible with present reference (§6.4). See, for example, the
past tense translations of the sentences in (171) and (172).
The temporal specifier M, N <""`Q is another predicate clitic implicated in temporal reckoning. It precedes tense, mood and pronominal clitics in the clitic sequence. The temporal specifier
is not a tense marker, but is used to indicate temporal sequencing of events and states. It is usually
left untranslated, but can be rendered ‘now, then, at that time’ if necessary. The temporal specifier
is grammatically optional, but is stylistically important and very frequent in discourse. See §7.3.3
for further information.
4.3.3Other cliticsThus far we have seen clitics expressing mood, pronominals, and tense. These belong to a larger
set of clitics that may occur in the predicate. When more than one occurs on the same word in the
predicate, they are strictly ordered. Although the order differs somewhat for the two languages,
clitics in both may be divided into three groups based on their sequencing requirements: premodal clitics, mood and pronominal clitics, and post-modal clitics. Pre-modal clitics precede
mood clitics. Among them we find the following (only a single allomorph of each is shown):106(174)Selected pre-modal cliticsIntentive Future: N <F`9pQ (§7.3.2)
Causative: M, N <""`o
Temporal Specifier (‘now, then, at that time’): M, N <""`Q (§7.3.3)
Passive-inverse: M <""hs, N <""`s (§4.4.2, §7.3.5)
Possessive: M, N <tj (§7.3.4)
Tense: including past M<(a)hs, N <(l)hs and hypothetical future M <""dxhj, N <""h9j
Co-occurrence restrictions and relative ordering of these clitics are discussed at §7.5. Some of
the clitics in (174) are briefly discussed elsewhere in this chapter, e.g. see §4.4.2 for the passiveinverse.
Post-modal clitics follow mood and pronominal clitics.

Habitual: M <`9j, N <F`9K` (§7.4.2)
‘again’: M <QFn, N <Q`9 (§7.4.4)
4.3.4Predicate modifiersThe basic predicate structure of head and clitics in the examples seen so far in this section may be
expanded by the addition of one or two predicate modifiers. Predicate modifiers are a small
closed-class of words like N F`GF@ ‘then’, M F@ch, N F@mh ‘really, in fact’, M xTxT, N C@mh
‘at first, for a while, temporarily’, N FHpGH ‘still’, M gTF`Wh ‘still, yet’, M jTvhK, N jtVhK`
‘doing as directed’, N v@Q ‘now, then, thereupon’, and M xTpi@, N XTpi@ ‘likewise’. A few
words from other word classes can also play this syntactic role, e.g. M FhFHWi`, N FHGi ‘big’
also occurs as as a predicate modifier meaning ‘really, very much, to a great extent’.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122]"

8.1 Inventory
Southern Wakashan has at least the following classes of unextended words (§4.2.1).
(491)Nominals
Nouns (§8.2.1)
Numerals, quantities, and quantifiers (§8.2.2)
Pronouns (§8.2.3)
Verbs (§8.3)
Predicate modifiers (§8.4)This list does not include particles, that is, words with limited capacity for taking lexical suffixes
or clitics and no implication of aspect. The class of particles includes imperative particles, interjections, and syntactic particles. See Swadesh (1933: 20-23, 1939: 80-81) for more information.114
The degree of grammatical differentiation among word classes in Southern Wakashan is famously low.115 Words are sometimes said to be polyfunctional (e.g. Rose 1981: 10, who, referring
to Kyuquot, speaks of “the extreme degree of constituent multipurposeness of lexical entries”),
but according to the conception of Southern Wakashan syntax developed in Chapter 4, this characterization is a bit misleading. Referring phrases (RPs), the syntactic realization of referring expressions, are claimed to be headless relative clauses or “nominalized” clauses, where “nominal”
is understood to mean “referring expression”.116 This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that all full
words (except proper names) are predicative, as Swadesh (1933, 1939) proposed early on. Hence,
the difference between (common) nouns and verbs is not in their ability to function in different
grammatical roles, for there is only one major syntactic role in Southern Wakashan, predicate325head, but rather in the ease with which clauses headed by them can function as clauses that refer,
referring phrases, which fill the syntactic roles of subject, object, and oblique.
Based on this insight, first expressed by Jacobsen (1979a) in somewhat different terms, we
can say more precisely that clauses with verbal predicates cannot function as RPs unless they also
have an expressed nominal subject or are marked by the enclitic article M <?hp, N <FH, or both.
Thus, the second and third words in (492)a, a verbal predicate and its object, cannot be interpreted as belonging to an RP that functions as subject of ghwi@F`k ‘he/she is working hard’. This
proposition would have to be expressed by (492)b, which includes the article:
(492)*MAKAHa. *ghwi@F`k
)ghwi@<""`Q<?h
*working.hard=TEMP=INDIC.3sgEhQHEHx
g`Fta

g`Fta wwwwww
EhÊ(x)` [RepR]<?hp g`Fta`
cut–REP=ART
food wwwwwwwwwwwwwwww‘The one, a certain one who is cutting food, is working hard.’
Note, however, that (492)a could mean ‘he/she is working hard cutting fish’.
It may well be, as argued by Nakayama (1997a), that good functional motivations exist for
this structural pattern, but since it defines distributional classes, there seems no reason not to call
words in the resulting classes “nouns” and “verbs”.117 I claim that the essential difference between Southern Wakashan and a language like Latin is one of degree, not of kind: it is not that
Latin has nouns and verbs and Southern Wakashan does not, but that the degree of grammaticalization of the classes is much greater in Latin than in Southern Wakashan.
The three nominal subclasses (noun, numeral/quantifier, pronoun) are distinguished by formal criteria discussed in the relevant sections below. Such formal differences are again slight.
Predicate modifiers are distinguished from verbs by their lack of ability to function as predicate heads and by the pattern of clitic placement in predicates containing them (§8.4).","[338, 339, 340, 341]"
"273 Phonological Alternations
A variety of phonological alternations take place during word formation, the most important and
common of which are described in this chapter. The presentation is descriptive in intent and informal for the most part, although, for descriptive purposes, it does assume a model of phonology
with extrinsically ordered rules applied to underlying forms.
The alternations are presented in order of application to underlying forms except that the
automatic alternations in §3.2 are ordered after the morpheme-specific alternations in §3.3 even
though they are described first for expository reasons. The important issue of vowel-length alternations is discussed apart from the other alternations in §3.1. Only alternations of some generality
are discussed individually in this chapter; those that are restricted to a few morphemes or are
rarely encountered are introduced as necessary.
Underlying forms, which do double duty as citation forms, frequently contain diacritics that
specify how or if certain morpheme-specific rules apply. It has not been possible to avoid using
morphemes with diacritics in examples before the diacritics themselves have been introduced;
readers may consult the list of abbreviations and symbols after the Table of Contents for brief
explanations of them. Most are used in the same way as in Sapir and Swadesh’s works, where
they were originally introduced (see especially Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-39), although their
diacritic conventions have been simplified in a few cases. Some of their original diacritics are
used to abbreviate sets of allomorphs (cf. McCawley 1967: 108): they represent the phonological
properties of each allomorph in a single citation form by “superimposing” the allomorphs on one
another. Sometimes, however, the present analysis posits a single underlying form for such lexical items rather than an allomorph set, which eliminates the need for Sapir and Swadesh’s diacritic. For example, labialized consonants alternate with their non-labialized homorganic counterparts in word-final position and a few other environments (§3.2.2), e.g. we find l`l@rhX`ji,Hb28‘belonging to a mud shark’, but l`l@rhX`j ‘mud shark’ without the suffix. In Sapir and
Swadesh’s analysis, the ‘mud shark’ root has two allomorphs, the word-final allomorph
/l`l@rhX`j/ and the pre-vowel allomorph /l`l@rhX`ji,/. They merge these to produce the
citation form l`l@rhX`j(i,), where the parentheses and hyphen show that the labialized allomorph appears before vowel-initial suffixes. The analysis proposed in §3.2.2, on the other hand,
posits the underlying form l`l@rhX`ji and an automatic delabialization rule. With this analysis
the parentheses and hyphen are redundant: since no labialized final consonant fails to alternate in
the relevant environment, there is no need for a special mark to signal the alternation.12
Many of the alternations described in this chapter are triggered by affixation. The language
distinguishes an inner layer of affixes, mostly suffixes but also a few infixes, from an outer layer
of enclitics. The inner affixes include various aspectual formatives and “lexical” suffixes, suffixes
with relatively concrete meanings like the verbalizing suffix ,rhlC ‘doing ritual for ...’. The clitics are more loosely joined to their host phonologically, and typically have more abstract grammatical functions than inner-layer affixes, coding grammatical categories like tense, mood, and
person and number of the subject. The inner affixes and the clitics behave differently with regard
to several of the phonological alternations described. Differences will be noted piecemeal as we
go along, and a summary list of them can be found in Chapter 7.","[42, 43, 44]"

ABSTRACT
Studies in Southern Wakashan (Nootkan) Grammar
by
Matthew DavidsonThis dissertation is a study of Southern Wakashan (Nootkan) grammar using data from two languages, Makah and the Tseshaht dialect of Nuuchahnulth (Nootka). The phonology, morphology,
and syntax of each language are examined with emphasis on structurally important or typologically interesting features. The description of Makah is based mostly on field data collected in
Neah Bay, Washington by the author. Nuuchahnulth data is drawn from Sapir and Swadesh’s two
published text collections on the language (Sapir & Swadesh 1939, 1955).
Chapter One introduces the Southern Wakashan family and describes the nature of the present study, explaining how the dissertation came to be written, the corpus used in the study, and
previous literature on Southern Wakashan. Chapter Two summarizes Southern Wakashan segmental phonology with a presentation of the Nuuchahnulth consonant and vowel inventories, basic allophonic processes, ablaut patterns, and discussion of the special behavior of nasals when
they appear in syllable codas. The accent systems of the two languages are also briefly described
and compared. Chapter Three, Phonological Alternations, describes a variety of alternations triggered by affixation, including glottalization and lenition of final base segments by affixes, alterations to the CV skeleton of bases required by affixes, and, in Makah, widespread patterns of
vowel insertion and loss. Chapter Four is a grammatical sketch of Southern Wakashan divided
into sections on word classes, morphology (word structure, lexical suffixes, and aspect), predicate
structure, basic clause structure (referring phrase functions, constituent order, clause types), referring phrases, and complex constructions. Chapter Five examines the recursive polysynthetic word
structure more closely. Chapter Six presents the aspect system. Chapter Seven, Clitics, describesxviimood and pronominal clitics, as well as other clitics associated with predicates. Chapter Eight
argues that, although word classes are very weakly grammaticalized in Makah and Nuuchahnulth,
distributional evidence is available for distinguishing nouns (and other nominal subcategories)
from verbs. It goes on to show many examples of nominals and verbs in each of their possible
syntactic contexts. Lists of lexical suffixes in Makah and Nuuchahnulth and selected Makah vocabulary are provided in two appendices.","[14, 15, 16]"

The behavioral properties of such object-like RPs must be compared across apparent transitive
types in order to determine their status. The most obvious behavioral property of RPs to test is
whether they can become passive subject. Another is their ability to precede the predicate head,
which appears to be possible only for core RPs (Rose 1981).",[141]
"1264.4.3.2Nominal predicatesNominal predicate heads in Southern Wakashan occur in three construction types: class-inclusion
predicates, equational constructions, and existential constructions.
Class-inclusion predicates
In Makah and Nuuchahnulth, nominals may function directly as predicate heads with no intervening copular element.52 They take predicate clitics exactly as verbal predicates do: there are no restrictions on the predicate clitics they may occur with. The words in (205)-(206) show Makah
nouns and property words as heads of class-inclusion predicates; that is, predicates denoting a
class of entities the subject is asserted to be a member of.53 Example (207) shows an intransitive
verbal predicate for comparison. The coding of each clause type is identical: the mood and pronominal clitics are attached directly to the predicate head in all cases. (Only the masculine singular gloss is given for the third person examples for sake of economy.)

the past tense noun, property, and verbal predicates in (208).54 Polar Interrogative mood is used
in these examples instead of Indicative mood for sake of variety, and also to further illustrate the
ability of nominal words to occur with mood and subject clitics. Only second person singular127forms are given, the possibility of nominal predicates occurring with all persons being amply
demonstrated by (205) and (206). Second person singular is zero-marked with this mood in

The homogeneity of coding across word classes demonstrated for mood-marked predicates in

word, and an intransitive verb as bare absolute predicates in complements to the negative root

property + noun, a quantifier + noun, etc.). The words in a multi-word nominal predicate head are
usually strictly ordered: quantifier/numeral > property > noun. Clitics must occur on the first
word of the head. Example (210) shows two multi-word nominal predicates; the predicated expression in (210)a is M FhFHWi PhcHQ ‘big dog’ and, in (210)b, it is N QtK g`Ftl ‘good food’.
Note the position of the predicate modifier XTpi@ ‘likewise’ following g`Ftl in (210)b; its
location is evidence that the string QtKF`Q g`Ftl is indeed a unitary predicate head, since, as
described in §4.3.4, post-head predicate modifiers usually directly follow the predicate head and
precede core arguments.

Equational clauses
Within the major clause types in a language one often finds subtypes with different coding properties that vary according to the semantic or grammatical properties of the lexical items functioning in predicates (e.g. transitive and intransitive subtypes of verbal predication), or according to
different functional predication types possible with expressions headed by the same word class.
An important distinction of the latter sort among nominal predicates is between clauses with
class-inclusion predicates (called “true nominal predicates” by Dryer [to appear]) and those with
equational predicates. In a (declarative) class-inclusion clause the subject is asserted to be a
member of the class of entities denoted by the predicate, e.g. John is a teacher. An equational129clause, on the other hand, asserts that the individual denoted by the predicate is the same as the
individual denoted by the subject, i.e. the latter is equated with the former, e.g. John is the
teacher. In English, the two types are distinguished in several ways (Lyons 1977: 471-72, Dryer
[to appear]). The examples in the previous section are of the class-inclusion type, e.g. (205)a M
vhjvHx@jr ‘I am a boy’. We see from those examples that class-inclusion clauses in Southern
Wakashan have the nominal expression as the (syntactic) predicate head. Clauses with equational
predicates are formed at least two ways. The first, and less preferred, way, only attested in Nuuchahnulth, is to use the same construction found in class-inclusion clauses: the entity to which the
subject is equated serves as predicate head with the appropriate predicate clitics attached:
(211)NUUCHAHNULTHG`VhKl`
G`VhK<l@ghK
ghKchief=INDICtherewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww‘He is the chief there.’ (based on NA 47.2)
Although the translation of (211) in the source and its discourse context make clear that it is to be
taken as equational, out of context it is presumably ambiguous between class-inclusion and equational readings, i.e. out of context (211) could also mean ‘He is a chief (i.e. high ranking male)
there’. (The usual English gloss for G`VhK, ‘chief’, is misleading because it implies unique status
for its referent in a group. The word actually refers to any high-ranking male, so a group can have
more than one G`VhK –– the class-inclusion reading is perfectly plausible, and, as we see next, is
probably preferred.)
The second, and more common, construction involves pronouns interposed as copular elements. This is in fact the only possible construction if the (semantic) predicate is a personal name,
place name, an RP with the article, or, in Makah, an RP with a possessive clitic, because these
types of nominal expressions cannot normally function as syntactic predicate heads:55130(212)MAKAHa. *BillFh

*gtWs`jÊr`9pÊshFh9<?hp<?h
*know.how–CAUS.PERF–...er=ART=INDICBill
Bill
Bill*‘Bill is the teacher.’
(The prohibition against co-occurrence of mood clitics and the article will be shown to be natural
when I suggest in §4.5.1 that the article itself is a mood clitic.)
The precise form of the correct construction in Nuuchahnulth depends on the person of the
subject, which is the entity on X-side of the semantic equational schema. If it is first or second
person, the predicative form of the appropriate independent pronoun intervenes as predicate head,
and the entity on the Y-side of the equational schema is simply syntactically apposed to it:56

rhX@p<(l)@<`G m`omHs<FH
1sg.PRED=INDIC=1sgpriest=ART‘I am the priest.’
The literal force of this construction appears to be ‘I am I (who am) Niinispatwas’, with the name
or RP-with-article as an “appositional complement” to the predicate. This is supported by the fact
that the very same construction translates as ‘It it I, NAME’.

If the subject is third person, the deictic pronoun FtG ‘this one, that one, so-and-so, such-andsuch’ fills the syntactic predicate head slot with the X as its subject and the Y as antecedent to
FtG. The construction literally means something like ‘He is so-and-so (who is) Bill’ or ‘Bill is
that one (who is) the priest’. Note in (216)c that the Y has been moved before the predicate head,
while in (216)d it is the X that has been fronted.

4.6.2Complement constructionsComplement clauses fill a (semantic) argument slot of a higher complement-taking (CT) predicate head. It is unclear whether complement clauses have grammatical relations with matrix
predicate heads (i.e. function as subjects or objects) as well, or are simply oblique constituents of
some sort. Southern Wakashan has both bare absolute and mood-marked complement clauses.
The essential structural difference between a complement construction and an adverbial construction is that, in the former construction, the roles of the two clauses are not permutable, while,
in the latter construction, they are. That is, only (245)a is grammatical; the complement-taking
word vhj,, vhjH ‘not’ must be the initial, subject-marked, predicate head:

However, when two clauses are in an adverbial relation, either may be the initial predicate:

(Note that (246)a is the unmarked construction; the variant in (246)b adds emphasis to the identity of the instrument: ‘I chopped it with my axe’.)1554.6.2.1Bare absolute complementsA bare absolute complement clause always follows the matrix clause. An expressed RP subject
can either precede or follow the complement predicate. The subject of the complement predicate
must be co-referential to that of the matrix.

Ftxh, in origin a derived word meaning ‘at so-and-so time’ but now essentially grammaticalized
(in this construction, at least) as a temporal-conditional complementizer. Makah does not have
F`mh. It is not known whether the Makah analogue of the Nuuchahnulth temporal-conditional
complementizer (Ftxt) occurs with Conditional complements, but it seems likely.

5.1 Formal structure
According to a traditional morphological classification of languages,67 Southern Wakashan is a
classic example of a language family with polysynthetic word structure. Though definitions vary,
a major criterion for polysynthetic status in most accounts is a high average number of morphemes per word. An important corollary is that a significant portion of these must be “lexical”,
rather than grammatical in nature; that is, they should have meanings typically expressed by independent lexical items in other languages. These morphemes might include incorporated nouns
and adverbs, or semantically rich affixes like locative suffixes. Such features permit polysynthetic
languages to have words with complex internal structure that often correspond semantically to
entire sentences in less morphologically elaborate languages.68 True to type, words in Southern
Wakashan can be internally complex with numerous morphemes and multiple hierarchic levels of
structure packed into a single derivative.69
Southern Wakashan word structure can be described by the diagram in Figure 2, a more
detailed version of Figure 1 given previously in Chapter 4.70 The major structural division falls
between the unextended word (base + suffixes) and the extended word level (unextended word +
clitics). Important formal differences exist between the two. The sequence of clitics has templatelike organization with a fixed number of slots, flat structure, strict requirements on linear order of
Figure 2. Word structure

in principle to the number of suffixes that can be added to a base, and the order of suffixes can
often be changed to produce changes in meaning, as demonstrated by the following example set
from Swadesh (1939: 86):
(254)NUUCHAHNULTHa. QtXHrbjih
QtrÊ""HrÊbjiH
herring–consume–remains.of‘left-overs from eating herring’
(254) b. QtrbjihYhr
QtrÊbjihÊpÊ""Hr
herring–remains.of–BFR–consume‘eating left-overs of herring’
This open-ended “stacking” of suffixes creates layered structure rather than flat, slot-based structure with a fixed number of affix positions. The remainder of this section describes these formal
aspects of unextended word structure further. Use of clitics has been briefly described in §4.3 and
is more fully covered in Chapter 7.
An unextended word is formed by a base plus (core) lexical suffixes plus aspectual morphemes. (Expanded unextended words and the core/peripheral suffix distinction are discussed
below.) Words can have aspectual value with no overt aspectual formative if their final morpheme (root or lexical suffix) has inherent aspectual force. Anticipating more detailed discussion
of suffix types in §5.3, we find two basic types of lexical suffix: nuclear suffixes (nominalizing,
verbalizing suffixes, etc.), which determine the word class of the resultant word (§5.4), and restrictive suffixes, which merely modify the meaning of the base without necessarily altering its
word class (§5.5). From these definitions we derive two principles of Southern Wakashan word
formation:
i. The category of a nuclear suffix becomes the category of the resultant word.71
ii. Restrictive suffixes do not necessarily determine the category of the resultant word.","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"5.7 Etymological relations between lexical suffixes and roots
Lexical suffixes are at least very rare cross-linguistically and clearly very different semantically
than affixes in familiar languages.83 Despite their root-like meanings, very few show any phonological relationship to a root from which one might hypothesize they are historically derived.
Swadesh (1939: 79) points out two lexical suffixes with both obvious phonological and semantic
similarity to an extant root: the path suffix N ,l`K,, M ,a`K, ‘moving about’ with root N l`K,
‘move’, M a`K`s, ‘(large object) tremble, shake’, and the verbalizing suffix N, M -v@(K) ‘say ...’
with root N, M v@ ‘say’. We might also compare the root N FHpG, ‘tell, narrate’ (probably reduced from earlier *Fhx`pG,) to the verbalizing suffix N ,hx`pG [R] ‘sing ... song’, or, in Kyuquot dialect, ‘tell ... story’ (Rose 1981: 356). A final example involves the primitive root element
N, M vh, that occurs as a component of various roots expressing negative concepts, e.g. N vhj,
M vhjH ‘not’, N vHX`, M vHx` ‘never’, M vHa` ‘not know, recognize a person’, N vhF`ji
‘invulnerable, unafraid’, N, M vH,p, ‘angry, unpleasant; stormy, bad (weather)’, and many others.84 This element evidently occurs as a suffix in a single Nuuchahnulth derivative, rtvHX`j
‘instrument for not holding, nothing to hold’ (< rt, ‘hold’ + ,vH + ,X`ji ‘... instrument’)
(Swadesh 1933: 154). These root/suffix pairs exhaust readily detectable examples. More typical
is the situation shown in (319): roots with semantically similar suffixes are not phonologically
related to them:
(319)RootLexical SuffixN O`OH, M OhOhFH ‘ear’N ,""hlK, M ,""`ahK‘at the ear’N p`rH, M p`khFH ‘eye’N ,(b)rt(K), M ,(j)rhK‘at, in the eye’214N StGBhsh, M StWTBhc` ‘head’ N ,`xtj, M ,dxtj‘at the head, hair’N ,(v)h9ji‘on the head’N ,(b)rhmxtj‘on the head’N ,vhGs`‘at the head’Many body parts are not even coded by roots. If they must be referred to, the corresponding
body-part locative suffix is affixed to a dummy root, either the empty root N ghs`, ghm`, ghm,, M
ghs`, ghc`, or the general locative root N F`l,, M F`u, F`a, e.g.
(320)N F`F`l`r‘(on) the cheeks’ (,`r [R] ‘at the cheeks’)M F`F`a`c`phK ‘(at) the midriff’ (,`c`phK [R] ‘at the midriff’)
N ghm`jrtK‘(at) the mouth, lips’ (,`jrt(K) ‘at the mouth, lips’)M ghs`ptK‘(at) the face’ (,(p)T(K) ‘at the face’)5.8 Specialization
Derived words vary widely in spontaneity of composition and degree of lexicalization. Speakers
are capable of using the principles of derivation we have discussed in this chapter to spontaneously produce and interpret new words, but many derived words must be considered elements of
the permanent mental lexicon, that is, words that are learned as units by speakers during the
course of language acquisition and not derived anew for each use. The clearest indication of this
is specialization of meaning. Derived words frequently have meanings more specific than the
meanings of their component parts would suggest. Examples are legion. The Nuuchahnulth word
FHGsTo (FHGi ‘big’ + ,(R)sTo ‘... species’) literally means ‘big sort, species of thing’ but now
denotes only ‘whale’. The literal force of the component morphemes (‘big’ and ‘... species’) has
been lost, as shown by the fact that one can say ‘big whale’ by modifying the derived word with
one of its own components: FHG FHGsTo ‘a big whale’ (NA 149.47). Similarly, N bhY`r (bhp,

"7.5 Organization of the clitic sequence
Clitics fall into three groups: pre-modal (§7.3), mood and pronominal (§7.2), and post-modal
(§7.4). Though some combinations of clitics are rare or unattested (e.g. temporal specifier and
future in Makah, intentive future and irrealis in Nuuchahnulth), most of the pre- and post-modal
clitics may co-occur with one another and with the mood and pronominal clitics or an article.
When two or more clitics are hosted by the same word, they appear in a fixed order. The order of
clitics in Makah is shown in (483).
(483)Organization of the clitic sequence in Makah=DIM=TEMP=CAUS=POSS=PINV=TENSE=MOOD=PRO=HAB=3PL=RESP=again
The tense slot can be filled by either future <""dxhj or past <(a)hs (<(a)t preceding second and
third person). There seems to be another future clitic <hQ, but this is not well attested. The pre-321modal benefactive clitic <to follows the temporal specifier, but its exact position among the
other pre-modal clitics is unknown:

The “advisitive” clitic <jd9 mentioned in §7.2.20 is another post-modal clitic; it is not known
whether this co-occurs with the other post-modal clitics, and, if so, where it occurs in the sequence.
The order of Nuuchahnulth clitics is shown in (485).
(485)Organization of the clitic sequence in Nuuchahnulth=DIM=INTENT=CAUS=TEMP=PINV=POSS=IRR=FUT=PAST=MOOD=PRO=3PL=again=HAB
One of three future tense clitics may appear in the FUT slot. Note that, unlike its Makah cognate,
the Nuuchahnulth past tense is not in paradigmatic opposition with future tense. It may co-occur
with at least two of the future clitics, <(x)hj IRR.FUT and <""h9j FUT (not at the same time), to
express present and past counterfactuality.

When the Nuuchahnulth causative and possessive occur in the same sequence, the possessive
precedes the causative (487)a, although if the causative is not present it comes later in the sequence, following the passive-inverse (487)b:
(487)a. POSS<CAUS<TEMP<PINV

Example (487)b also shows that the temporal specifier normally precedes passive-inverse and
possessive. When the irrealis and temporal specifier co-occur, however, the temporal specifier
follows the irrealis and thus these other clitics as well:
(488)PINV<POSS<IRR<TEMP

When the temporal specifier moves to the right of the irrealis, the passive-inverse and possessive
may optionally “piggy-back” along. Compare their positions in (488) to their positions in (489):
(489)PINV<IRR<TEMP<PINV<POSS

In (488) only the temporal specifier has moved. In (489) the passive-inverse and the possessive
have moved with it; all three clitics now follow the irrealis. Surprisingly, a copy of the passiveinverse is retained before the irrealis. This means the passive-inverse occurs twice in the same
sequence. Such double marking occurs only in this circumstance and is unknown with other clitics. Example (490) gives two more instances of double passive-inverse marking:

The objects expressing the R and T arguments seem to receive identical grammatical treatment; there is no immediate evidence for recognizing either distinct direct and indirect object re-122lations, or distinct primary object (PO) and secondary object (SO) relations. In a PO/SO system,
the R argument of a ditransitive predicate is treated grammatically like the single P argument of a
transitive predicate (Dryer 1986, to appear). The sentences shown in (198)-(199) might suggest a
PO/SO system in Southern Wakashan, but this is probably artifactual. We have seen that, while
objects are marked by clitics in Makah, they are not in Nuuchahnulth. There is one exception to
this rule: as shown in (198)b, first person objects in Nuuchahnulth are marked in clauses in Imperative mood with second person subjects (§7.2.20).

In an Imperative mood ditransitive clause with a first person R, the R is likewise marked by the

The first person R in (199) is treated like first person P in (198) as in a PO/SO system, but this is
simply a reflection of the general primacy in Southern Wakashan of first person over third person123we already have seen in the discussion of subject choice §4.4.2, rather than evidence of any particular grammatical identity of R and P arguments per se.
The T and R arguments can both be expressed by overt RPs in the same clause, but it is more
common for only one object RP to appear. Frequently one or the other is old information and left
unmarked if third person singular (in Makah) or third person (in Nuuchahnulth):

Another option is to express the R and T in separate clauses with a bare absolute construction
(§4.5). In (201)a, the T arguments are set off with the bare absolute predicate FtxHF`Q ‘give’,
and, in (201)b, the R argument is set off with FtFHo ‘give a gift to’.

Atransitive predicates have no semantic arguments. Moods are marked just as in other clause
types, but there is no subject reference. Atransitives typically express environmental situations
like weather conditions.

In addition to the apparently clear-cut examples of different predicate types we have seen to
this point, Makah and Nuuchahnulth present not a few cases that are less easy to categorize. As
Dryer (to appear) points out, the classification of predicates based on transitivity in a language
rests on the ability to distinguish transitive verbs (or other transitive predicates) with objects from
intransitive predicates with adjuncts (or obliques). In Southern Wakashan, this distinction is not125always straightforward. First, there is little explicit marking of syntactic relations or transitivity.51
Second, earlier examples like (184)a-f have shown that locative and temporal obliques can occur
in a sentence with no overt marking of their adjunct status. It must be considered at least a possibility that other participant roles (e.g. instrumentals) might occur as unmarked adjuncts as well.
Hence, it is not always clear which non-subject RPs are objects and which are adjuncts. For example, on the face of it, it is unclear whether the instrumental participants in the Nuuchahnulth
examples in (203)a-c (‘club’, ‘stick’, ‘cedar-limb lines’) are objects in some type of ditransitive
construction or adjuncts. (See §4.5 for a more common way of expressing instrumentals.)

7.3.5Passive-inverse(Makah) <""hs, (Nuuchahnulth) <""`s, <""`9m before <(l)hs past tense and sometimes <tj possessive (PINV): This clitic covers the functional range of passive and inverse constructions in
other languages. Its use is triggered by the following conditions:
1. The A argument of a transitive clause is lower than the P argument on one of two hierarchies,
a person hierarchy (1,2 > 3) or a topicality hierarchy (more topical > less topical).
2. The S argument of an intransitive clause or the A argument of a transitive clause is impersonal.
Let us first consider the principles governing the use of the passive-inverse in relation to the person hierarchy.109
When one argument of a transitive clause is a speech-act participant (SAP) and the other is
third person, the SAP must be the subject regardless of its semantic role. If the third person argu-310ment is the P (patient-like argument), it is coded as object, and the clause is direct, i.e. nonpassive-inverse.

If, on the other hand, the SAP is the P, a passive-inverse construction is used (marked by the passive-inverse clitic on the predicate head) with the SAP as subject and the third person A (agentlike argument) as an oblique (463)a. A direct construction with the third person A as subject and
the SAP P as object is ungrammatical (463)b.

A word on the morphological status of aspectual formatives as inflectional or derivational elements in Nuuchahnulth is in order at this point. In this dissertation, word class terms like noun
and verb refer to classes of lexemes. To claim that M PhcHQ ‘dog’ is a noun and PhcHQRhQ ‘become a dog’ is a verb is therefore also to claim that the perfective aspect suffix is changing the
lexeme class of the base.120 The power to change lexeme class is generally seen as a property of
derivational, rather than inflectional morphemes. According to such a conception of the inflectional/derivational distinction, it would seem that Southern Wakashan aspect must be considered
derivational. Further support for this idea comes from the frequent occurrence of aspect before
affixes that would seem uncontroversially derivational, as in the Makah noun344(527)Q@Q@Rj`sdx`j
Q`Rj`sÊ(x)` [RepR]Êx`ji
rigid–REP–thing.for‘(an) iron’
where the nominalizing suffix ,x`ji ‘thing, instrument for ...’ occurs on a base already containing the repetitive aspect formation. In terms of the analysis of word structure given in Figure 2
(Chapter 5), the word consists of the bound root Q`Rj`s, ‘rigid, stiff’ as base followed by the
repetitive aspect to form an unextended word Q@Q@Rj`s` ‘making rigid’, followed in turn by
the peripheral suffix ,x`ji, which forms an expanded unextended word. (,x`ji is one of a handful of lexical suffixes that can function as either core or peripheral suffixes.)
Third, derived verbs are formed by bases of any class with nuclear verbalizing suffixes:

"355105There are a few examples of it attaching to a lone demonstrative in Nuuchahnulth, however,
e.g. F`GjTFh ‘that one’.
106
Tseshaht x@ is probably cognate with the morpheme g@ in Kyuquot dialect that Rose (1981:
40) describes as a definite article.
107
In Makah, the article itself may be extended by demonstrative elements: <?hp`9c proximate
article, e.g. PhcHkhp@c ‘this dog’, <?hp@b distal article, e.g. PhcHkhp`9b ‘that dog’.
108
See Rose (1981: 206, ex. 43; 209, ex. 60-61)
109
Rose (1981), Rose & Carlson (1984), Whistler (1985), Emanatian (1986), and Nakayama
(1997b) may be consulted for further discussion of passivization in Nuuchahnulth, especially the
controversy over whether this construction should be properly be considered a passive or an inverse. The reader will correctly infer from my labeling the morpheme in question “passiveinverse” that I consider the question to be terminological. The Southern Wakashan construction
simply mixes properties associated with constructions called “passive” and “inverse” in other
languages. It appears to be intransitive like the English passive, but is subject to person and topicality hierarchies like inverse constructions in Algonquian languages.
110
An obvious alternative analysis of this construction some have suggested describes ,(C)hK as an
object case marker. Rose (1981: 62-67) presents several arguments against such an analysis and
for a multi-clausal analysis like the one given here.
111
This is perhaps a typo for ,@bxhm, the normal shape of this suffix, cf. Sapir & Swadesh (1939:
319).
112
Makah has a morpheme ,""tW seems analogous to the Nuuchahnulth irrealis clitic, but it is not
yet fully analyzed.
113
In formal speeches first person singular forms may have plural reference (i.e. ‘I’ = ‘we’).
114
The classification of many words expressing property concepts is unclear. This uncertainty
primarily involves free roots like dimension terms, e.g. M, N F`p ‘wide’, M FhFHWi`, N FHGi
‘big’, and evaluative terms, e.g. M QtKT, N QtK ‘good’, and also some words with the durative
aspect suffix, e.g. M, N Ihrtj ‘white’, M, N F`C`ji ‘propped, wedged up’. Most property words
probably belong to a subclass of verbs, as proposed by Jacobsen (1979a), but some may constitute a separate class of adjectives (Rose 1981). Their syntax requires further investigation before
definitive classification can be made. Other property words such as those formed with suffixes I
have classified as verbalizing state suffixes (§5.4.1), e.g. M ,chs, N ,mhs ‘stocked with ...’, M, N
-h9b ‘belonging to ...’, are more clearly verbs.
115
Jacobsen (1979a: 84-108) includes a thorough review of various proposals concerning Southern Wakashan word classes in both the primary and secondary literature.
116
This is a different sense of “nominal” from the one used in the preceding list of word classes,
where the word simply means ‘having the character of a noun, noun-like’.
117
I therefore disagree with Nakayama’s (1997a: 64) contention that “...[T]here is no strong formal basis for positing word classes in Nuu-chah-nulth. That is, there is no unique and constant
correspondence between sets of words and formal markers or formal structuring patterns that justifies grammatical classes among words.”
118
Note also that this is a rare example of a post-head predicate modifier hosting a clitic.
119
The speaker is the mythological culture hero Kwatyaat, whose speech is characterized by inserted /x/’s (Sapir 1915, reprint 1949: 186; Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 210, footnote 8).
120
Jacobsen (1979a: 106) makes the same claim: “[T]he momentaneous [i.e. perfective––MD]
formation ... derives verbs from stems of other classes.”","[370, 371]"

The base, which is here only a noun root, provides more precise specification of the meaning of
the suffix –– it fills out or completes its meaning just as the object NP does for the English preposition.
The word in (275)b demonstrates an entirely different grammatical relationship between suffix and base. Unlike ,Ch, the suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ does not determine the class of the resultant word, which remains a noun; it adds information about the base and limits or restricts its denotation, much as an adjective or relative clause limits the denotation of an English noun: the
word’s potential referent is not only a pack-basket, but a pack-basket that is in a container. The
noun p`FTbBt ‘pack-basket in a container’ functions like any other noun. Example (277) shows
it as nominal predicate head in a main clause:
(277)NUUCHAHNULTHap`FTbB`Ql`
p`FTbÊBT<""`Q<l@mHr@jFhwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
mHr@ji<FHpack.basket–in.container=TEMP=INDICsack=ARTa. ‘There is a pack-basket in the sack.’
b. ‘The sack has a pack-basket in it.’
c. ‘He/she/they have a pack-basket in the sack.’
The source of the multiple meanings is described in §4.4.3.2. If the predicate is atransitive
(§4.4.3.1), the clause has the existential reading in (277)a, and the RP mHr@jFh ‘the sack’ is a182locative oblique expanding the reference of ,BT. If the subject is personal, the sentence can mean
either (277)b or (277)c depending on the subject reference: if mHr@jFh is interpreted as the subject, (277)b is the appropriate translation; if it is interpreted as an oblique locative, (277)c is the
appropriate translation. The word might also occur as predicate head in a referring phrase (RP):

not–find–PERF=TEMP=INDIC=1sg[sack=ARTpack.basket–in.container]
referring phrase‘I could not find [the sack with a pack-basket in it].’
This use is related to the possessive-existential meaning in (277)b. The RP literally means something like ‘the sack having a pack-basket in it’.
I refer to suffixes of the ,Ch type as nuclear suffixes. Suffixes like ,BT are restrictive suffixes.77 The essential difference between the nuclear and restrictive types is that a nuclear suffix
determines the class of the resultant word, while a restrictive suffix simply modifies the meaning
of its base without fundamentally altering its semantic category or word class. This can be also
expressed in terms of headedness: a nuclear suffix becomes the head of the resultant word, while
the base remains the head when a restrictive suffix is added.78 There are also the morphological
differences between the two types described in §5.1.
The Nuuchahnulth examples in (279) (from Swadesh 1948b: 62) provide further illustration
of the nuclear/restrictive distinction. Compare the word class and denotation of the words in
(279)a and (279)c with that of the word in (279)b.

canoe–big=INDIC‘It is a large canoe.’
noun: E`o`b`p ‘large canoe’
The underived word in (279)a, E`o`b ‘canoe’, and the derived word with the restrictive suffix in
(279)c, E`o`b`p ‘large canoe’, are both nouns and refer to the same entity: addition of the restrictive suffix ,(p)`p ‘very; big’ (this time a degree suffix rather than a locative suffix) has not
changed the word class or reference of the resultant word. Addition of the verbalizing suffix
-(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’ in (279)b, on the other hand, changes the category from noun to
verb, and fundamentally alters the relation of subject to predicate.
Boas’s (1947: 237) objection to this classification scheme runs as follows. (The original
quote is rather oddly phrased. I have taken the liberty of including Nakayama’s 1997a: 49 clarificatory emendations in brackets):
We cannot accept the classification of “formative” suffixes in two groups: “governing” and “restrictive” suffixes which are not based on internal evidence, but
rather on our European classifications ... For instance [the morphological complex] “to see a canoe” which [includes a lexical suffix expressing the notion of
“to see” that] would fall under the heading of “governing suffixes” may as well
be conceived as “to perform an action relating to a canoe by seeing” in which
case [the lexical suffix expressing] “to see” would be a restrictive element ... It is
impossible to decide how these combinations may be felt by native speakers.
Formally the governing and restrictive groups are identical.
His point concerning Eurocentric approaches to grammar is well taken, as I have said. In this case
though, contra Boas, the nuclear/restriction distinction is not a product of “European classifications”. The distinction is real and fundamental to Nuuchahnulth word formation. We see better184why his charge is unwarranted if we break it down into three subparts and address them individually. Each makes a slightly differently claim:
1. There is no language internal evidence for the distinction;
2. There is no formal evidence of the distinction;
3. Classifications of individual suffixes as governing [nuclear] or restrictive are artifacts of
translation, as purportedly shown by the ‘see a canoe’ example.
All three of these points can be shown to be false.
The first and second claims are contradicted by patterns like those I presented above, which
show systematic differences in the grammatical and semantic relationships between the two types
of suffixes and their bases. These are certainly language internal and formal (since determination
of word class is based on distributional evidence) –– nuclear suffixes have the power to determine
the class of the resultant word, while restrictive suffixes normally do not. Chapter 8 discusses the
criteria for defining word classes.
As for the third claim, Boas fails to show that the distinction is an artifact of translation because the revised translation of ‘see a canoe’ he proposes to demonstrate this is nothing more than
a convoluted restatement of the original translation. His revision still contains a verb phrase,
namely ‘to perform an action relating to ... by seeing’. Hence, the suffix with this translation
would still produce a verb rather than a noun, which is precisely what is predicted. Further, the
fact that ‘see’ is restrictive in the new translation is irrelevant since it does not modify the right
word. If the suffix were restrictive in the present sense, it would modify the base ‘canoe’ and produce a noun denoting something about a canoe that sees or is seen. Instead, the phrase ‘by seeing’
is an adverbial phrase that modifies the participle construction ‘relating to ...’, which itself modifies the word ‘action’ in the verb phrase ‘perform an action’. As Swadesh (1948b: 62) himself
points out:185Boas says that ‘to see a canoe’ ... may as well be conceived as ‘to perform an action relating to a canoe by seeing.’ But, since the stem alone means ‘canoe,’ this
translation includes for the meaning of the suffix ‘by seeing to perform an action
relating to’ –– which leaves the problem exactly as before ... It is no mere trick of
English translation but an inescapable fact that the relation of subject and stem
remains the same in [(279)a and (279)c] but is radically changed in [(279)b].
Ironically, Boas’ pessimism about gaining insight into native classification leads him to a
wholly translation-based descriptive categorization of suffixes in Kwakwala that is not so far
from the structurally-based scheme adopted for Southern Wakashan in this dissertation (see especially Boas 1947: 237-46). He divides Kwakwala suffixes into 19 categories (some of which contain only one or two suffixes) with labels like “general locatives”, “special locatives”, “nominal
suffixes”, “verbal suffixes”, etc. Based on examples of suffixes he offers from various categories,
it seems likely that at least the locative suffixes and nominal/verbal suffixes (and perhaps suffixes
of the other classes) fall into behaviorally distinguishable super categories comparable to the
Southern Wakashan restrictive and nuclear classes.
I present a provisional summary classification of the various Southern Wakashan nuclear and
restrictive subcategories below. Complete suffix lists can be found in Appendix A. For the most
part these categories have distinct formal properties, which provides some justification for claiming they are reflective of native classification. However, the semantic subdivision of restrictive
locative suffixes in Appendix A (after Rose 1981: 359-61) is simply a convenience to show the
reader the range of meanings expressed by them and is not based on language-internal or formal
criteria.
The proposed classification is not intended as a Procrustean scheme into which all suffixes
must neatly fit. Some fall into more than one category. For example, a handful of suffixes are
sometimes used as restrictive locative suffixes and other times as nuclear verbalizing suffixes
(e.g. N ,bHK ‘(restrictive) on the edge; (nuclear verbalizing) on the ... edge’). These are generally
listed only once in Appendix A, under the category that seems most characteristic.","[196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"

heads in main clauses. Sometimes predication of numerals and other words in this class seems to
involve a type of quantifier raising, whereby a word that would otherwise appear as a predicate in
an RP is instead raised to main predicate position, e.g. (516)b,d.

Southern Wakashan is apparently cross-linguistically unusual in having numerals as predicate
heads: it is an exception to Greenberg’s (2000: 770) generalization that “most languages show a
reluctance to predicate numerals”.
8.2.3Independent pronounsSouthern Wakashan has a set of independent first and second persons pronouns. Nuuchahnulth
pronouns have distinct forms for referential, predicative, and possessive functions (Table 25). The339simple referential form of the pronoun appears when it is base (in its combining form) to lexical
suffixes in a derived word, or when it is used (in its free form) in a subject or object RP. The examples in (517) demonstrate the first of these environments. (517)a shows rh, ‘I, me’ in a derived

When a pronoun is to function as the P (patient-like ) argument, it often occurs as base in a derived verb with the verbalizing suffix -(C)hK [L] ‘do to ...’ rather than appearing as an independent
word; this is actually the most common circumstance in which pronouns appear in derived verbs.
The derived P-encoding verb usually occurs as a bare absolute predicate following the transitive
predicate denoting the main action (§4.6.1.1).

In these sentences the locative oblique RPs add information about the locative specification given
by the locative suffixes on the predicate head, i.e.,
(185)a ,""`Wr,hQ --- E`o`Bhp ‘in(to) a vessel, the canoe’
(185)b ,o`Q --- C`aDFhKrhr ‘in the house (on) my bed’

(185)e ,pr,ho --- IhlRr`bFh ‘in(to) a vessel, the boiling box’ in (185)c
Another strategy is for the locative element itself to be the predicate head. The languages differ somewhat as to nature of this locative predicate. Makah has a transitive verb, Fhx`W` ‘(be) at’,
described by Jacobsen (1979a) as a “preposition” (which, for him, is a subtype of transitive verb),115but I prefer to think of it simply as a locational verb. With this verb as predicate head, the locative
RP is not an oblique, but an argument. A path-orientation suffix or locative suffix can occur on
the verb to further specify the location.

The locative verb often occurs in a bare absolute adverbial clause (§4.6.1.1):

Nuuchahnulth has a series of intransitive deictic verbs of which ghK ‘there, at this place’ is
one of the most commonly encountered.48 The locative RP is set in apposition to the deictic verb.
The deictic may or may not contain restrictive path-orientation or locative suffixes that further
specify location.

These constructions certainly do not exhaust the means for expressing location in Makah and
Nuuchahnulth, but at least give an idea of how this function is accomplished.
Locative and temporal modifiers are not the only oblique RP types. Agent RPs in passiveinverse clauses and possessed RPs in clauses with possessor subjects are also oblique:

See §7.3.4 for the possessive subject construction and §7.3.5 for the passive-inverse.
4.4.2The grammar and functional dynamics of subject choiceAn important characteristic of the syntax (really, an interaction between syntax and discourse
principles) is a strong tendency for speech-act participants (i.e. first and second persons) and
highly topical third person arguments to occupy main grammatical roles, particularly subject.49 It
is not, of course, uncommon for languages to show a statistical preference for coding such participants as subjects, but Southern Wakashan stands out for how sensitive the structure of basic
clauses is to reference-related requirements on subject choice. The use of two common constructions, the passive-inverse and possessor-raising constructions, is largely controlled by these concerns. Details are reserved for §7.3.4 and §7.3.5, but a preliminary Makah example will give an
idea of the considerations involved.","[129, 130, 131, 132]"

"4.1 Word classes
Makah and Nuuchahnulth have at least the following word classes. (Note that “word class” in this
dissertation refers to distributionally-defined classes of unextended words, §4.2.1).
Nominals
Nouns
Numerals, quantities, and quantifiers
Pronouns and demonstratives
Verbs
Predicate modifiers
The division between the major classes of nominal and verb rests on the syntactic fact (first
pointed out by Jacobsen 1979a) that nominals may occur as single-word referring phrases (RPs),
the Nootkan equivalent of a noun phrase, while verbs may do so only when accompanied by the
enclitic article M <?hp, N <FH (§4.5, §7.2.21). In Makah, the classes are further distinguished
by the fact that only nominals may occur with possessive enclitics like <rhr first singular possessive ‘my’ (cf. Jacobsen 1979a: 140). The various nominal subclasses are distinguished from each
other by morphological and syntactic criteria laid out in Chapter 8. Unlike words of the other
classes, predicate modifiers may not function as predicate heads (§4.3.4).
As will be evident throughout the present chapter, the degree of grammatical differentiation
among word classes is quite low. Consequently, researchers have debated whether Southern Wa-92kashan languages should be analyzed as having nouns, verbs, and other word classes at all. Most
(e.g. Swadesh 1933, 1939, Sapir & Swadesh 1939, Renker 1987, Nakayama 1997a) have argued
that they should not be, while others (e.g. Jacobsen 1979a, Rose 1981) disagree. In this dissertation I accept the claim that the distributional differences one finds do justify word classes in
Southern Wakashan. See §8.1 for discussion.
I reserve word-class terms like noun and verb for words, but the Southern Wakashan lexicon
also contains many bound roots that cannot function as a word without affixation by a lexical suffix or aspectual formative. Bound roots are provisionally referred to as “bound verb roots” or
“bound noun roots” (though the vast majority seem to be verb roots) based on morphosemantic
parallelisms with free roots of the relevant class (§8.1).","[107, 108]"
"35367See Anderson (1985: 9-10) and Spencer (1991: 37-39) for introductory discussion. In Sapir’s
(1921: 142-43) morphological typology, Nuuchahnulth (or Nootka, in his terminology) is classified as having a polysynthetic level of synthesis and “agglutinative (symbolic tinge)” technique.
68
See Fortescue (1994) for more detailed characterization of polysynthetic languages.
69
In a 100-word sample from Text 2 in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 19-21), Jacobsen (1993: 266)
counts an average of 3.66 morphemes per word in Nuuchahnulth, which just slightly lower than
Greenberg’s (1954) figure of 3.72 morphemes per word in a similar sized sample from Eskimo.
70
Figure 2 should be understood as a static representation of the structure of existing words,
rather than a generative device for creating new words. Without extensive filtering or constraint
mechanisms, Figure 2 will generate many impossible words.
71
This statement does not apply to words formed on relative roots like N x`pi, M x`p@ ‘one
who, that which’, which always determine the category of the resultant word regardless of suffix
type, e.g. N x`pi plus the verbalizing suffix N ,FhC ‘clothed in ...’ forms the noun x`piFhC
‘clothing, what one is wearing’ rather than the verb *‘wearing sth that is ...’.
72
The terms “core” and “peripheral” are borrowed from Nakayama (1997a), where they are used
in a different sense.
73
See Haas (1972) for more on Nootkan root structure.
74
As mentioned later (see note 114 in Chapter 8), it is not clear if evaluative and dimensional
terms are a subclass of verbs or constitute a separate class of adjectives.
75
See Rose (1981: 284-89) for a different classification scheme.
76
Eskimo languages also have suffixes of this type, which are sometimes called “post bases” in
the specialist literature (e.g. Jacobson 1984, Miyaoka 1996). Eskimo, Wakashan, and Quileute are
strikingly similar in their reliance on these suffixes to the virtual exclusion of other wordformation techniques. Eskimo languages are even more extreme than Wakashan and Quileute in
this respect.
77
Other works refer to nuclear suffixes as “governing” suffixes, a term I avoid since nuclear suffixes sometimes do not “govern” the base in the sense used in current grammatical theory.
78
This statement is generally true, but oversimplified. Certain restrictive path-orientation suffixes
have the effect of deriving verbs due to their inherent perfective aspect (§5.5.1). In these cases,
the restrictive suffix could be considered the grammatical head, but the base remains in some
sense the main semantic element.
79
These types roughly correspond to Swadesh’s (1933, 1939) governing action and governing
state suffixes.
80
Rose (1981: 357-58) categorizes most of my verbalizing state suffixes as “adjectival” rather
than “verbal” suffixes, but, assuming her (p. 344) definition of the adjective class, it is not clear
how this could be correct. Jacobsen (1979a: 139) refers to Makah ,h9b ‘belonging to ...’ as forming adjectives, but since he considers Makah adjectives a subtype of intransitive verb, there is no
disagreement with the present analysis.
81
Locale suffixes are called “zone” suffixes in Davidson (1999).
82
The initial vowel is shortened due to insertion of the long epenthetic vowel (§3.4.3).
83
“The use of suffixes for adding new material ideas to the initial morpheme is common to a restricted area inhabited by all the Kwakiutl dialects, Nootka [and other Southern Wakashan languages––MD], Quileute, and Salish. Outside of this area it is unknown. Its closest analogue is
found in the suffixes of the Eskimo language” (Boas 1947: 236).
84
This root element must go back to Proto-Wakashan, cf. Kwakwala forms such as vhP5mWi` ‘to
fail to go straight to a person’ (Boas 1947).","[368, 369]"
"35122Cf. also Sapir’s (1938, reprint 1949: 231-32) discussion of the historical origins of glottalization, where he argues that it is unlikely to have been simply a result of coalescence of consonant
+ glottal stop clusters.
23
Like glottalization (§3.3.2), lenition (referred to as “softening” by Wakashanists) is a well described process, and the two are often treated together. Many of same sources are relevant: Sapir
(1924: 92, note 84; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 5-6), Rose (1976,
1981: 18), Nakayama (1997a: 19-20). On lenition in Ditidaht, see Swadesh & Swadesh (1933:
199), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.
24
Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238) cite QtX`r ‘good on the ground’, but this form is not attested in
the corpus. QtKF`r is found at NA 15.18.
25
Sapir (1938, reprint 1949: 236), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 237), Rose (1981: 22-23)
26
Examples (90) and (91) are from Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 236).

one used in this dissertation.

Final /a/ is present underlyingly, but does not appear in the surface form due to a rule of final
vowel deletion in Makah (§3.4.3) (cf. also Jacobsen 1971).
31
Boas (1947: 238), Lincoln & Rath (1980: 111)
32
This, incidentally, raises the question of the historical source of modern Southern Wakashan
non-labialized velars, which, with the exception of /w/, are by no means rare in the present day
languages. That is, if PW velars became alveo-palatals, whence the velar in morphemes like the
N, M root j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’?
33
TRANS = transitivizing suffix used with stative or intransitive verbs (Boas 1947: 241, #6); NOM
= nominal suffix (Boas 1947: 323). Thanks to Emmon Bach for checking my Kwakwala forms.
He drew my attention to the fact that Boas (1947: 353) erroneously writes the ‘lick’ root in (120)c
with a plain voiceless velar stop. I have substituted the correct glottalized form per Lincoln and
Rath (1980: 244).
34
See Haas (1969: 111-112, 115-120) for discussion and examples of similar correspondences
between Nuuchahnulth and Ditidaht.
35
This word, like many others with original */Wi/, now contains morphophonemic /Gi/ (§3.3.2).
36
Makah voiceless stops undergo the allophonic process of coda aspiration described for Nuuchahnulth in §2.1.
37
This example and the next are found on page 16 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in
Jacobsen’s possession.
38
Jacobsen (1996) indicates these segments with a capital barred-l.
39
Jacobsen (p.c.) has recorded this suffix as ,#` and ,#h. The ,#t form appears in my data.
40
This example is found on page 9 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in Jacobsen’s possession.
41
See §2.5 for accent.
42
Some speakers change /@/ preceding /v/ to /N/ so they would have [c`9Kn9w].
43
Interestingly, Ditidaht shows similar patterns of syncope except that, in Ditidaht, it is the second of the two vowels that deletes rather than the first. See Swadesh & Swadesh (1933).
44
This first-syllable shortening sometimes seems to apply also in words that have undergone epenthesis (§3.4.3).
45
More fully translated in Makah as ‘good, rich tasting, full of fat (said of shellfish)’.
46
Actually, the question of whether Makah, Nuuchahnulth, and other languages with lexical verbalizing suffixes can be characterized as incorporating is controversial. I am agreeing with the352view expressed by Sapir (1911b) and Mithun (1984), among others, that these languages are not
incorporating. See Jacobsen (1993: 266-67, note 2) for discussion.
47
Swadesh himself (1933: 11, note 1) compares them to the Latin enclitic conjunction -que.
48
At least one of these, x@K ‘yonder’, is attested in Makah as well.
49
See §4.4.1 for brief comments on grammatical relations. The relevant aspect of this topic here
is that a subject category can be justified for Southern Wakashan.
50
Cf. Swadesh (1933: 101-02).
51
This characteristic of Nuuchahnulth and Southern Wakashan languages contrasts sharply with
the situation in Salish languages, which are generally quite careful about indicating transitivity.

However, equational clauses involving personal names, place names, and RPs that contain the
article do require a copular element. See below for discussion.

Jacobsen (1979a: 114) tentatively reports a possible restriction in Makah against occurrence of
the future tense clitic with nouns. However, I was able to elicit several examples of nouns with
this clitic with no difficulty.
55
A few exceptions to this generalization have turned up in Nuuchahnulth, but syntactic predicates expressing names all seem to have existential readings, e.g. there at the door is Codfishalways-getting it (the name of a family crest), rather than equational readings.

58
This claim does not apply to proper names, which, as discussed in §4.4.3.2, cannot function as
(syntactic) predicate heads.
59
Swadesh (1939: 82) proposes the same analysis, labeling the Nuuchahnulth article a “subject
relative” in a list of modal formatives and glossing it ‘he who is, does’.
60
However, the proper analysis of Makah RPs with possessive clitics, which have essentially the
same syntactic distribution as the article, (e.g. E`o`b<rhr ‘my canoe’) is as yet unclear.
61
Some have suggested that referring expressions in Salish languages are also nominalized predicates or clauses. See, for example, van Eijk (1997) on Lillooet and Thompson, Thompson, &
Egesdal (1996) on Thompson. Similar claims have been made for other languages of the Americas. See Comrie & Thompson (1985: 391-95) for a brief review.
62
Relative roots do have the special property of remaining the grammatical head of the word
when affixed by nuclear lexical suffixes, which otherwise become head themselves. See §5.1.
63
These might be considered a kind of equational clause (§4.4.3.2).
64
Often it is also possible to express manner of action and relation in a single derived verb, with
the manner expressed by the base and the relation by a suffix, e.g. M J`b,hx@, N J`b,H pinchgive.PERF ‘pinch sth off and give it to’, M C`p,hx@, N C`p,`xH push-give.PERF ‘push sth to sb’,
M Bhbj,hx@ throw-give.PERF ‘throw sth to sb’, N b`r,Hbr chase-bringing.along ‘chase sth
along’. For an example of the first word, see (201)b.
65
With some hesitation he terms this construction “serialization”, a characterization I find misleading because of the many differences between the Southern Wakashan construction and constructions called “serial verb” constructions in other languages, e.g. 1) any number of predicates
can be so combined (although more than two or three is uncommon), 2) the set of predicates from
which bare absolute predicates can be drawn is open-ended, 3) any lexical item can fill the role of
main predicate or of the bare absolute.
66
“Serialization combines multiple clauses into a unit that expresses a single state of affairs (=
event or state), i.e. a predication” (Nakayama 1997a: 115).","[366, 367, 368]"

Complex (i.e. multiple-predicate) constructions, which we continue our discussion of in this section, are very frequent in Southern Wakashan and classifying them into a definitive set of types is
far from straightforward. Rose (1981), Jacobsen (1993), and Nakayama (1997a) provide three
alternative views of how to divide up the pie. I make a few comments below on differences149among the various schemes, but a comprehensive evaluation of them is a task for the future. The
main area of difference is the status of different kinds of absolute predicates.
The difficulty in classifying multi-predicate constructions arises mostly from the scarce marking of grammatical relationships between words and clauses. The analyst is often left attempting
to differentiate constructions by subtle and sometimes apparently statistical behavioral characteristics of uncertain grammatical significance. Jacobsen (1993: 239-40) provides a useful summary
of the analytic problems one encounters.
Keeping the preceding caveat in mind, I recognize the following types of clauses in complex
constructions: the referring phrases described in §4.5 (i.e. “nominalized” clauses), adverbial
clauses (§4.6.1), and complement clauses (§4.6.2).
4.6.1Adverbial clauses4.6.1.1Bare absolute constructionsAn exceedingly common sentence-building device in Southern Wakashan is to introduce one or
more bare absolute predicates into a sentence with an adverbial function. These elaborate on, expand, or modify the meaning of the main predicate. Subjects must be coreferential.

Bare absolute constructions are a favorite sentence type, and used for a wide variety of expressive
purposes. One frequently finds sentences composed of two transitive predicates in which one
predicate expresses something of the specific manner or type of action affecting the object while
the other expresses the general relation of subject to object. The general relation is often coded by
a verbalizing lexical suffix. For example, in the Nuuchahnulth examples in (240) we see the following distribution of meanings between predicates:
General Relation of ParticipantsSpecific Manner/Type of Action

The semantic patterns are sometimes easier to see with literal translations, e.g.

(240)d: ‘She was consuming [relation] worm-wood by eating [manner of action] it’.64151Instrumentals, locations, and other adjunct participants can be introduced into a sentence with

"In addition to glottalizing suffixes there are also several glottalizing clitics, e.g. <""`Q temporal specifier, <""`s passive-inverse. These are similar to glottalizing suffixes, but have less influence on preceding sounds: they glottalize preceding stops just as glottalizing suffixes, but simply
insert a glottal stop when following fricatives. They do not glottalize them:

glottalizing suffixes. The three leniting suffixes are ,#hK ‘on the floor, in the house’, ,#hr ‘on the
beach’, and ,#`ChQ perfective inceptive aspect. Table 6 summarizes these patterns.",[73]
"Finally, there is an obvious difference in denotation between lexical suffixes and clitics. As
we have seen, suffixes often have semantic content akin to that of independent lexical items, or
even phrases, in English, e.g. M ,(ji)h9K [L+S] ‘making ...’, ,hctW ‘looking for ...’, -`chK [L] ‘on
the neck’. The meanings of clitics (e.g. tense, mood) are much more abstract by comparison, and
clearly mark them as belonging to the grammatical, rather than the lexical level, of the language.
Before turning to more detailed discussion of individual clitics, let us remind ourselves of
their general character. Syntactically, clitics are most associated with the predicate, which was
defined in §4.3 as an obligatory predicate head (normally a single word, but sometimes a complex
of property + noun, numeral + noun, etc.) and one or two optional predicate modifiers. Based on254their typical positions in this predicate structure, three types of clitics can be distinguished
(§4.3.4): 1) second-position clitics, which attach to the first word of the predicate, whether head
or modifier, 2) head clitics, which attach at least to the head, and 3) flexibly-positioned clitics.
The Nuuchahnulth sentence in (367) shows exemplars of each category. The second-position
tense, mood, and pronominal subject clitics are hosted by the initial predicate modifier; the passive-inverse and possessive head clitics are hosted by the predicate head EHKr@o ‘cause to escape, run away’; and the flexibly-positioned temporal specifer <""`Q is hosted by both.

However, rightward copying of second-position clitics is sometimes possible and leftward copying of head clitics is common. In (368)a, the subject clitic has been copied from the initial modifier onto the following head, and in (368)b, the passive-inverse has been copied onto the initial
modifier from the following head:

Another situation in which head clitics are copied leftward involves the passive-inverse, which is
often copied from the head of a lower bare absolute complement head onto the head of the higher
matrix predicate (§4.6.2.1):255(369)NUUCHAHNULTHavhJ`s

It has been suggested by some (e.g. Klokeid 1976, Renker 1987) that clitics in Ditidaht and
Makah (and, by extension, Nuuchahnulth) form a second-position AUX constituent. I find examples like (367)-(369) to be evidence against this analysis, since the clitics do not appear to form a
single block or constituent in sentence structure, nor do they all automatically attach to the first
word of the predicate (or sentence).","[269, 270, 271]"

the affix is from the portion of the word specified by the template, either in number of syllables or
in number of morphemes. The locative suffix -`oh ‘in the air, erect; standing’ selects the (a) template. If attached to the four syllable (synchronically) monomorphemic base j`Kjhms`ohlK,
‘strawberry’, the first syllable must be long even though the affix itself is separated from it by
several intervening syllables:
(48)j@Kjhms`ohlKÊ`oh‘strawberry up in the air’Similarly, the word F`E`otFhKhl ‘a pad underneath’ consists of four morphemes, the root F`C,
‘support with a block or pad’ and three neutral (not associated with a template) suffixes, ,""`ot(K),
‘underneath’, ,#hK ‘in the house’, and -hl ‘... thing’ (lit. ‘thing serving as a pad underneath in the
house’). If affixed by the suffix -GVhmji [L] ‘using ...’, which selects the (a) template, the first
syllable is lengthened despite the three suffixes between the specifying suffix and the specified
syllable:
(49)F@EÊ`otÊFhKÊhlÊGVhmj‘using a pad underneath’Affixes are subject to their own templatic specification if their position in a base is within
their template’s domain. Let us consider a straightforward example. The suffix -bh9Xtj [L+S]
‘going to ...’ is associated with the (b) template, the two-syllable template that requires the first
syllable of the word to be long and the second syllable short. If this suffix is affixed to a monosyllabic base such as the relative root pih, ‘whoever, whatever’, the persistently long first syllable of45the suffix ends up as the second syllable of the resultant base and is thus subject to shortening by
the template: piHbhXtj ‘wherever one is going’:
(50)underlying→B0 UG0 B1 E1pihÊbh9Xtj→pi H b h---XtjA word can contain multiple template-specifying affixes (suffixes or infixes). Three types of
interactions are possible. The affixes can specify 1) the same template, 2) compatible templates,
or 3) conflicting templates. The result of the first situation can be predicted from the principles I
described above: because a base that conforms to a particular template requires no alteration upon
addition of an affix associated with that template, we would correctly predict that a given template is only applied once; addition of a second affix associated with the same template as an earlier affix will thus produce no change. Example (51) demonstrates this with a word with two affixes specifying template (a):
(51)FTrhlCM`Gh
FtÊrhlC [L]ÊM`Gh [L]
so.and.so–do.ritual.for–ready.to‘ready to perform a ritual for it’
Assuming that templates are applied in order from left to right as their affixes are added to the
base, we would expect the effects of compatible templates to be cumulative. That is, effects of
later templates are applied to the form that results from application of earlier templates. Examples
like (52) seem to bear this out:
(52)Y@Y`pl`pJtji`MTG
Y`pÊl`pÊJtj [R]Ê@Mt(K) [L]Êh9G [L]
grass–plant–resemble–along.length–PL‘made of hemp rope, pl.’ (NA 63.46)
The leftmost non-neutral suffix is -Jtj (,l`p, ‘... plant’ is neutral), which is associated with
template (d), initial CV reduplication with nonspecified vowel length. This template applied to
the underlying form Y`pl`pJtj produces Y`Y`pl`pJtj. The (a) template associated with46-@Mt(K) [L] ‘along a length’ is then applied producing Y@Y`pl`pJtji`MtK. Addition of the plural suffix ,h9G rounds out the attested form. (The final /K/ of ,@Mt(K) is deleted before the plural
suffix.)
Following the same logic, conflicting templatic effects ought to be resolved by the later template undoing the effects of the earlier template. Conflicts always involve conflicting length requirements. For example, when a suffix specifying the (a) template (long first syllable) is followed by a suffix that specifies the (c) template (first and second syllables both short), the resultant word should have a short first syllable. Comparison of (53)a-b supports this hypothesis:
(53)a. F@S@MtK
F`S`Ê@Mt(K) [L]
thick–along.length‘thick along its length’
b. F`S`MtK`p`p
F`S`Ê@Mt(K) [L]Ê`p`p [S+S]
thick–along.length–very‘very thick along its length’
The effect of the (a) template of -@Mt(K) [L] ‘along a length’ has been undone in (53)b by the (c)
template associated with ,(p)`p ,`p`p [S+S] ‘very’.
Although examples (51)-(53) are preliminary support for our predictions about templatic interactions, more study is necessary to determine how consistently they are born out. Rose (1981:
341) reports restrictions against the co-occurrence of suffixes associated with certain templates,
e.g. (g) and (h), in Kyuquot dialect. I suspect this is a consequence of the semantic or grammatical incompatibility of the suffixes rather than an inherent property of the templates themselves.
She also reports a dominance hierarchy among certain templates that determines which will prevail in combination. These possibilities require further investigation for Tseshaht. Incidentally,
affixes are frequently associated with different templates in Kyuquot and Tseshaht, e.g. -(b)rS`K
‘reciprocally’ is neutral in Tseshaht but associated with template (i) in Kyuquot (Rose 1981: 361).","[60, 61, 62]"
"1184.4.3Clause types4.4.3.1Verbal predicatesIn many languages, it is possible to classify verbal predicates by the number and types of objects
they take: intransitive (no object), transitive (one object), and ditransitive (two objects). Sometimes atransitive or ambient predicates, that is, predicates with no (semantic) arguments, are also
distinguished. In Southern Wakashan, a classification with roughly these types is possible in theory, but in practice it proves difficult to assign every predicate to one or another of the types with
certainty. In this section I first present a few more-or-less straightforward examples of each of the
apparent verbal predicate types (intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and atransitive), and then discuss problems that Makah and Nuuchahnulth raise for such a classification.
Intransitive predicates have a subject, but no object.

As a rule, however, simple RPs are less complex than main clauses; referring expressions requiring overt subject and/or object RPs are often expressed by apposed simple RPs (231), or else by a
root RP containing a relative root like x`pi ‘one who, that which’ (for which see §4.5.2 below).

The bracketing in (231)a represents one possible analysis of the structure of such examples. Other
analyses are conceivable.
If the RP does not contain a nominal word (i.e. a noun, property word?, or quantifier/numeral), use of the article is obligatory. If a nominal word is present, the article is optional;141in this case, its presence or absence can have functional significance. Its function overlaps the
English definite article, but, rather than indicating definiteness (i.e. identifiability or uniqueness),
the Southern Wakashan article appears to indicate something closer to specificity, e.g. pTF`rFh
in (231)a is more accurately translated ‘the, a certain one that is a man’. The function of the article is considered in more detail in §7.2.21.
The spirit, if not the letter, of the present analysis of RP structure is anticipated by Sapir
(1911a, 1924). The parallelism is somewhat obscured by the fact that, like other writers of the
time (cf. Andrade 1933 on Quileute, and Boas 1947 on Kwakwala), Sapir uses the terms “nominal” and “verbal” in reference to kinds of linguistic categories that are today considered distinct;
he uses these terms to refer to both lexeme categories (noun and verb) and logico-syntactic categories (referring expression or noun phrase and predicate). (We leave open here the question of
whether Sapir himself recognized such distinctions conceptually.) Making allowance for such
terminological conflation, we see the germ of the RPs-as-clauses analysis already in this early
statement (Sapir 1911a: 17): “In both [Nuuchahnulth and Kwakwala] the stem is, as far as its
meaning allows, indifferently verbal [i.e. able to function as predicate––MD] or nominal [i.e. able
to function as a referring expression] and one or more suffixes [clitics] are required to give rise to
definitely verbal [predicative] or nominal [referring] complexes; in [Nuuchahnulth] a suffixed
[<FH] is often used to substantivize [i.e. make referring] a verb [i.e. predicative] form.” Likewise, in Sapir (1924: 84, note 9), he says the article is “often used as [a] nominalizing element”.
A more straightforward antecedent is found in Jacobsen (1979a, 1993), who refers to
“nominalization by the Article of core clauses” (Jacobsen 1993: 256). On the same page he also
claims “[The Nuuchahnulth phrase] KTbrldFh “the woman” ... is formed from KTbrl`
“woman” as a nominalized predicate “the one who is a woman”, with the identifying value that
would be conferred by an English relative clause.” Referring to Makah, he (1979a: 122) says: “...
[F]orms with ,?hp contain undercover predications, so that, for instance, PhcHkhp is literally, or at
least etymologically, ‘(the) one that is a dog’.” This is close to the present analysis, except I142ogically, ‘(the) one that is a dog’.” This is close to the present analysis, except I would omit the
etymological qualification. I claim Southern Wakashan RPs contain predications synchronically,
and, moreover, that all RPs (except proper names), even those without the article, are clauses; the
article is simply an overt marker of the subordinate syntactic status of RPs as referring expressions.60, 61
An alternative line of analysis takes RP structure to be much like that of an English NP, that
is, a phrase consisting of a noun head and optional modifiers (Rose 1981: 39-45, Stonham 1999).
I will forego detailed discussion or critique of “standard NP” analyses except to comment that
they suffer from two main faults: 1) they fail to account for the clause-RP symmetries we have
seen, and 2) they assume the noun is the head of the phrase, but I see no language-internal structural evidence that justifies this assumption (e.g. a noun need not be present, the distribution of
the phrase as a whole is not equivalent to the distribution of the noun, etc.).
4.5.2Root RPsSimple RPs are the most common way of referring to entities. Another option, however, is to use
a “root” RP, i.e. an RP containing a relative root. These RPs are also headless relative clauses,
and are structurally similar to questions (§7.2.15-7.2.16). In this construction, a relative pronoun
root such as M x`p@, N x`pi ‘one who, that which’ or M pih, N pihp ‘whoever, whatever’ is
predicate head with a relative mood clitic and appropriate pronominal clitic attached. Other predicative clitics (e.g. passive-inverse, temporal specifier, tense) appear according to their normal
grammatical behavior. Predicates in the phrase other than the initial relative nominal predicate are
bare absolutes.

If the entity referred to is not equivalent to the subject of the phrase-internal predication, the relative root must in fact have affixed a verbalizing lexical suffix. The default suffix for this purpose
in Makah is ,(j)sh9o ‘doing to, with reference to ...’ and in Nuuchahnulth is -(C)hK [L] id., if a suffix with more specific meaning is not available. Compare the meanings of the root RPs in (234)

Root RPs can function as stand-alone referring expressions, as we have seen in all the examples so far in this section, but they are often set in apposition to simple RPs to form more complex
referring structures. They generally follow apposed simple RPs, but sometimes precede them

Unlike nuclear suffixes, multiple restrictive path-orientation and locative suffixes may occur on a
single level of hierarchical structure. When more than one occurs on the same level, they are or-167dered according to the following hierarchy: path > locative site > locative locale. That is, if a path
suffix is present, it comes first, followed by any locative site suffixes, followed by any locative
locale suffixes. (The structural distinction between site and locale suffixes is discussed in §5.5.2;
there are only four locale suffixes: M ,""@, N ,""@F` ‘on the rocks’, M, N ,""`r ‘on the ground’,
M, N ,#hK ‘in the house’, M, N ,#hr ‘on the beach’.) Sequences of more than three restrictive suffixes have not been observed. Only one path and one locale suffix may occur per sequence. Ordering principles governing multiple site suffixes are discussed in Davidson (1999). See also
Rose (1981: 336). The following examples show several Nuuchahnulth nouns with restrictive
sequences.

Southern Wakashan can be shown to follow an accusative alignment pattern: the single argument of an intransitive (S) predicate is treated grammatically like the agent-like argument of a
transitive (A) predicate (cf. also Jacobsen 1993: 236). Given the relative paucity of marking of
syntactic relations, this is not immediately obvious, but, as demonstrated by Rose (1981) for
Nuuchahnulth and later emphasized by Emanatian (1986), a subject relation (grammatical union
of S+A arguments) can be deduced from fairly subtle patterns of clausal co-reference we need not
elaborate here. Similar arguments could be developed for Makah.
A core RP can be positioned before the predicate head under certain pragmatic circumstances. Fronting of RPs has no effect on placement of clitics –– they remain on heads or predicate-initial modifiers as described in §4.3.4. Example (183) shows a pre-head subject:112(183)NUUCHAHNULTHXTpi@F`Q

The subject RP ‘a Tseshaht warrior’ has been displaced from its typical post-predicate position
and moved forward between the predicate-initial modifier and predicate head. The context for this
example involves contrastive focus on the subject, which perhaps motivates the shift. A canoe
load of Maktliath band warriors is struggling over a drift whale against a canoe load of Tseshaht
warriors. Both canoes have attached cedar ropes to the whale and are pulling in opposite directions. The sentences immediately preceding this example read ‘The Maktliath warrior Sound-ofDropping took the line (of the Tseshaht). He cut it apart.’ The subjects and objects in these sentences are in their usual position after the predicate . The tit-for-tat action reported by example
(183) produces a contrastive focus reading: ‘A Tseshaht warrior likewise took hold of the (Maktliath) line.’
Unlike core RPs, RPs functioning as oblique adverbial modifiers do not bear a grammatical
relation to the predicate head. As described further in §4.4.3.1, it can be difficult to determine in
some cases whether an RP is an object or an oblique, but differences in behavior do exist that distinguish the two (e.g. ability to passivize). Obliques most commonly occur after core RPs (184)g.

The two situations of the bird being alive and the speaker traveling home are clearly to be taken
as temporally overlapping: ‘... was alive as I returned home’. For another example, see (359)b.
Comrie (1976: 16-17) argues against equating perfectivity with short duration or momentaneous occurrence in part by citing examples from several languages that show perfective verbs in
construction with temporal expressions that imply duration like ‘for an hour’ and ‘for ten years’,
e.g. Ancient Greek ebasíleuse (perfective past) déka étē ‘he ruled ten years’. A similar argument
can be made in Southern Wakashan, with the difference that the temporal expressions themselves
take the perfective marking; they are complement-taking words that serve as matrix predicate
heads for the temporally modified complement clauses (§4.6.2.1), e.g. pH ‘(do) [COMP] for a
long time’ and lTCHK ‘(do) [COMP] for four days’. The perfective suffix with these expressions
indicates the completion of the time period denoted by the matrix.

Before discussing the functions of each aspectual morpheme in more detail in §§6.4-6.5, a summary of how the different aspects are marked is in order (Table 12). Perfective aspect is inherent
in the meaning of some free roots and lexical suffixes, e.g. M, N v`g@ji ‘go (perf.)’, M, N ,""hQ
[L] ‘get ... (perf.)’, M ,(j)rhKs`, N ,(b)rtGs` ‘come out of the woods (perf.)’. If it is not inherent,

suffix with changes to
vowel length of the baseperfective aspect is marked by the M, N suffix ,RhQ, which has many allomorphs (Table 13). A
handful of free roots and lexical suffixes (e.g. M FhFHWi`, N FHGi ‘big’, N X@p ‘long’) take the
“inceptive” suffix ,#`ChQ instead: X@p`ChQ ‘become long’. However, other roots and lexical suf-223fixes, particularly those with final vowels or (in Nuuchahnulth) coda nasals (§2.3), are marked for
perfective aspect by another suffix, M ,dx`ChQ or ,h9vhQ, N ,h9ChQ, traditionally known in the
literature as the inceptive: M ctCHvhQ ‘turn into a mountain’ (ctChFH ‘mountain’), N
phC`mHChQ ‘become a louse’ (phChm ‘louse’).
Perfective aspect is essentially marked by a single suffix (the inceptive suffixes notwithstanding), but imperfective aspect is indicated in a variety of ways. Most free roots and lexical suffixes
are inherently imperfective and require no special imperfective marking: M phCHc`, N phChm
‘louse’, M, N ,""`r ‘on the ground’, M -hctW, N ,M@G ‘seeking ...’. If a word is already perfective, it can be imperfectivized by the graduative, indicated by the [L+S] CV template (see example (324)).91 The durative suffix ,`ji ,tj added to a bound root indicates a stative intransitive
imperfective aspect: N mhmj`ji ‘wrapped around’ (mhmj, ‘twist, wrap around’); it also occurs
with many bound roots denoting manner of motion: M WHFtj ‘crawling’ (Wh, ‘crawl’). The continuative suffix ,(x)@ or, occasionally, the [L] CV template, with a bound root indicates dynamic
imperfective aspect: verb N mhmj@ ‘getting wrapped around’, verb M, N C`p@ ‘pushing’ (C`p,
‘push, shove’).
In addition to the graduative, durative, and continuative imperfective aspects, which can be
called “uniplex” imperfective aspects, there are two multiplex aspectual formations, the repetitive
and the iterative. These imply various types of iteration of events versus the essentially steadystate meanings of the uniplex aspects. The repetitive, which expresses events repeated at regular
and generally narrow-spaced intervals, is formed by a special reduplication type plus the suffix
-(x)`. As we will see below, the repetitive has expanded its function somewhat beyond this in
Makah to cover semantic space expressed by the continuative in Nuuchahnulth. The iterative,
which expresses irregular iteration, is formed in two ways, one involving reduplication, and the
other involving changes to the perfective form of the base.","[236, 237, 238, 239]"
"326The classification laid out in (491) does not include bound roots, since syntactic tests of the
sort used to classify words are irrelevant to them. Some, like M, N Shpi, ‘sitting’ or M, N gto,
‘roundish object’, seem clearly verbal or nominal, but, in the absence of specific distributional
criteria, attempts at classification are speculative. Additional morphological criteria must be developed to allow definitive placement of bound roots in the classification scheme. One way of
doing this is to compare the morphological distribution of bound roots with that of free roots
whose categorical status is already established. For instance, it is known that when (free) nouns in
construction with restrictive locative suffixes function as predicate heads, along with the regular
readings allowed nominal predicates, a bahuvrihi reading is generally possible whereby the subject of the predication is asserted to have some association with the referent of the noun loosely
referred to as “possession” (§4.4.3.2), e.g. the noun root M PhcHQ ‘dog’ (in its combining form
PhQC,) with the locative suffix ,""`Wr ‘in a vessel’ can have the meaning ‘X has a dog in a vessel’
as a predicate head:

‘He has a dog in his vessel.’
When a verb with a locative suffix is predicate head, on the other hand, a possessive-existential
reading is generally not possible:

MAKAHa`atx`Ji`Wr`k
a`atx`jiÊ""`Wr<""`Q<?h
work–in.vessel=TEMP=INDIC.3sg‘He is working in a vessel.’

It appears that when the bound root Shpi, ‘sitting’ is predicated with the suffix, the possessiveexistential reading is equally impossible:327(495) Bound root as base

ShpiÊ""`Wr<""`Q<?h
sit–in.vessel=TEMP=INDIC.3sg‘He is sitting in a vessel.’
*‘He has someone sitting in his vessel.’
The morphosemantic parallelism between a`atx`ji ‘working’ and Shpi, ‘sitting’ is one piece of
evidence for classifying Shpi, as a bound verb root. Until more such tests are developed and systematically applied to the lexicon, however, classification of bound roots must be considered
tentative.","[341, 342, 343]"

Nuuchahnulth also has directional imperatives that mean ‘come and ...!’ or ‘go and ...!’.

Finally, a structural note. As we have seen, the pronominal marking in the clitic sequence
usually expresses the person and number (in first and second person) of the subject. In Imperative
moods, however, first person objects are indexed with a pronominal clitic. In bare absolute complement constructions the mood and pronominal clitics occur on the matrix predicate (§4.6.2.1).
This means the first person object of a transitive bare absolute complement predicate is actually
marked on the matrix predicate instead of the complement in an Imperative mood.

7.2.21 The articles
The article M <?hp, N <FH (and its evidential-quotative counterpart N <(l)hE` ~ <E@) normally attaches to the first non-demonstrative word of the RP.105 It has multiple functions. The
most basic is simply to mark referring phrases as such. It occurs optionally with RPs containing a
noun or quantifier, but obligatorily with RPs that do not contain a word from one of these classes.
In cases where it is optional, its appearance seems to be conditioned by some functional parameter akin to definiteness. Sapir (1924: 84, note 9) calls <FH a “suffixed definite article, often used
as nominalizing element”, Swadesh (1948: 109) calls it a “definite suffix”, and Rose (1981: 250-29853) describes it as a definite and particularizing marker. Jacobsen (1973: 21) says the Makah article “indicates a certain definiteness of reference”. It is true that RPs whose referents are definite
(in the sense of identifiable) and particular (specific and referential) almost always have an article, sometimes in concert with the preceding demonstrative particle, x@ in Nuuchahnulth106 or sH
‘this’, WT ‘that’ and related forms in Makah.107 For example, the referents of N pTF`rFh ‘the
man’ in (443)a and N x@ pTF`rFh ‘the man’ in (443)b are introduced in preceding sentences of
their respective texts (Text 13 and Text 76) and are thus identifiable and particular.

However, definiteness and particularity cannot be the whole story, as shown by the two RPs in
example (444), which is the first sentence of Text 16.

FtÊm@ji<vDFhmG@ji@Q pTF`rFh

This sentence introduces the referents of both RPs into the text for the first time, which means
they ostensibly have the same identifiability status (unidentifiable), and both are particular, yet
the subject RP has an article and the object RP does not.
In general, RPs that depart from the narrow identifiable-and-particular type in (443) (e.g. RPs
with unidentifiable referents, non-referential expressions, generic RPs, etc.), show complex patterns of article use that are not well understood and that may not be reducible to a single general
principle. Consider the RPs in (445). These sentences come from a passage in which the speaker299is describing his attempt to build a big house, a project which first requires finding appropriately
large cedar logs. Sentence (445)a occurs two paragraphs before (445)b.

GtlHrgoodcedar‘... when I found good cedars.’ (NT 140.19)
The pattern of the article use in these sentences is further evidence against the definiteness-andparticularity hypothesis in its simplest form. Neither of the referents is identifiable, and the object
RP in (445)a, QtjiHsFh GtlHr ‘stout cedar logs’, which has the article, is non-referential –– the
speaker is looking for any objects that satisfy the intension of the RP rather than some specific
subset of stout cedar logs. In fact, that may be exactly the point: the article in (445)a may indicate
that the speaker is looking for “the whole set” in the sense that any member of the set of cedar
logs that are stout will do, while the lack of article in (445)b indicates he did not find the entire
set of good cedars, just some non-specific subset.
It is probably the case that the article is sensitive to discourse-pragmatic factors like topicality
and communicative importance in addition to –– or instead of –– definiteness or particularity/specificity strictly defined. Other criteria, as yet undiscovered, may also be relevant. As Rose
(1981) suggests, it may be necessary to take into account other elements that are present in an RP,
and if so, their categories. Further study of how the article is used in discourse is the only sure
way of making progress on these questions.
Makah also has a series of possessive clitics, shown in Table 23, that attach to the first word
of RPs containing a noun to indicate possessor.","[312, 313, 314, 315]"
"7Work on Makah was begun in the early 1960s by W. H. Jacobsen, Jr. His research has focused on various aspects of the (morpho)phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicography of the
language. This research program has produced the bulk of our knowledge of Makah. A number of
papers concentrate on phonology or morphophonology. Jacobsen (1968) addresses the issue of
glottalized resonants in the historical reconstruction of Makah and uses this reconstruction to account for some synchronic morphophonemic processes in the language. Jacobsen (1971) discusses the widespread patterns of vowel insertion and vowel loss. Ablaut in vocative forms is presented in Jacobsen (1994). Jacobsen (1996) describes the morphophonemic processes of “hardening” (i.e. glottalization) and “softening” (i.e. lenition) in Makah. Two papers, (Jacobsen 1997a,
1998a), deal with ablaut/reduplication patterns. Jacobsen (1998c) describes labialization dissimilation. Finally, Jacobsen (1999a, 2000) discuss the “velar increment”, an excrescent /k/ that appears in certain forms. In addition to these papers, there is another publication (Jacobsen 1979b,
1999b) that contains useful discussion of the segment inventory, pronunciation, and morphophonemics, as well as several modal paradigms.
Jacobsen’s works on Makah morphosyntax include Jacobsen (1973), which presents the system of pronouns and mood forms, and Jacobsen (1979a), an important paper that uses Makah data
to establish morphological and syntactic criteria for distinguishing word classes in Nootkan languages, which are often claimed to have no noun/verb contrast (cf. Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 23536 and Renker 1987). Other papers are Jacobsen (1979c), which considers the relationship of
Makah to the other Wakashan languages and discusses the history of Wakashan comparative
studies, Jacobsen (1980), on the semantics of Makah neologisms, and Jacobsen (1986), which
presents the Makah evidential system. Jacobsen (1998b) discusses an early Makah word list collected in 1792 by Spanish explorers.
The other researcher who has worked on Makah is A. Renker. Her American University dissertation (Renker 1987) examines the behavior of AUX elements in Makah grammar and con-8cludes that an appropriate characterization of these elements obviates the need for a noun/verb
distinction in Makah. In the course of the analysis, she presents part of the clitic system that codes
tense, person, mood, and evidentiality, as well as a classification of stem types based on their cooccurrence patterns with various AUX elements.
Several anthropological works contain information on Makah, including Waterman (1920), a
discussion of Makah whaling equipment, Gunther (1936) on ethnozoology, and Gunther (1945)
and Gill & Renker (1985) on ethnobotany.","[22, 23, 24]"
"117When one argument of a transitive clause is a speech-act participant (SAP) and the other is
third person, the SAP must be the subject regardless of its semantic role. If the third person argument is the P (patient-like argument), it is coded as object, and the clause is direct, i.e. nonpassive-inverse.

person A (agent-like argument) as an oblique (191)a. A direct construction with the third person

This example demonstrates the preference for having SAPs rather than third persons as subject. A similar (though not so rigidly enforced) preference exists for more topical third person
referents to occupy the subject role rather than less topical third person referents. As others have
noted (e.g. Jacobsen 1993: 236), this plays a major role in reference tracking in the absence of
other structural means (like case marking, a gender system, etc.) that could serve this function.","[132, 133]"
"7.2 Mood and pronominal clitics
We begin with description of the mood and pronominal clitics due to their importance in the
grammatical system. The basic principles underlying their use have been described in §4.3.1.
7.2.1Makah mood-pronominal formsJacobsen (1973) contains the first description of Makah moods and pronouns. My analysis generally agrees with his, but does differ in certain respects. Some differences are merely terminological, e.g. I have renamed his “nominal” mood the “Relative”. In other places, as he notes, alternative analyses of forms are possible given the raw data. My choice of an analytical alternative for
Makah has sometimes been influenced by study of the Nuuchahnulth material (and vice-versa).
For instance, one can analyze one particular Makah variant of the third person plural clitic as either <K or <`K (see the section “Third person subject” below). Based on the Nuuchahnulth cognate <F`K (§7.4.1), I have analyzed the form as <`K. This also brings the form into line with two
other variants of the clitic in Makah which are uncontroversially <@K and <?`K. On the other
hand, Jacobsen selects the <K option (Jacobsen 1973: 5, et passim), presumably on the sound
principle that, everything else being equal, one should only posit segments for which one has di-256rect evidence. For me, the Nuuchahnulth form and the other Makah forms tip the scales for <`K.
This allows us to straightforwardly reconstruct a third plural allomorph for Proto-Nootkan
*<(F)`K (assuming the Ditidaht data is not contradictory) without having to account for an errant
Makah reflex that lacks the vowel. Nonetheless, there is one instance in which it does seem we
must posit an <K allomorph in Makah (§7.4.2).
Combinations of first and second person
We begin our presentation of Makah pronominal clitics with forms expressing combinations of
first and second persons, shown in Table 14.

“object” because, as mentioned in §4.3.1, obliques are sometimes indexed by these forms as well
as objects.) Further morphological segmentation is possible in the table, but I have chosen to
leave the forms unanalyzed in this dissertation for simplicity. Jacobsen (1973: 6-8) can be consulted for suggestions concerning further analytic possibilities.
The four forms at the top left of the table express first person subject with second person nonsubject. These forms occur by themselves as Indicative mood forms as well as with clitics expressing other moods, or with no mood clitic (in absolute predicates). The bottom right of the table shows the eight forms expressing second person subject with first person non-subject. The
upper form in each cell occurs by itself as the Indicative mood form. (The longer forms appear257preceding the responsive post-modal clitic <Rh9 (§7.4.3).) The lower form occurs elsewhere, i.e.
with mood clitics or in absolute predicates.
First and second person subject, intransitive or with third person non-subject
Table 15 shows pronominal clitics expressing first and second person intransitive subjects. The
same forms convey first or second person subjects with third person non-subjects. Some forms

<∅<r`9have longer shapes when followed by certain post-modal clitics, especially the habitual <`9j
(§7.4.2) and the responsive <Rh9 (§7.4.3), e.g. the Set 2 second plural form is<rn9v`C when
followed by<`9j: <rNv`C@j ‘you (pl.) always ...’. Presentation of these longer variants is
mostly reserved for later sections to avoid cluttering the table with alternate forms. We can note
here, however, that the first person singular Set 1 form is <rh when followed by the habitual and
responsive, otherwise it is <r. The first person plural Set 1 form is <c unless it follows a consonant and is not in turn followed by a vowel, in which case it is <hc.
The forms are divided into four sets according to the shape they take following different
mood clitics, although no person/number combination shows four distinct variant forms: first singular and plural and second singular have three variants each; second person plural has only two.
Some individual variants for any given person/number combination are obviously shared between
sets, but the sets differ as to which particular variant they show, e.g. Set 2a and Set 2c show the
same first plural variant (<ct9), but for second singular, it is Set 2a and Set 2b that are identical
(<rt9).","[271, 272, 273]"

manuscripts.
While it is generally true that Sapir & Swadesh (1939, 1955) do not record the actual phonetic variation in labialization, even in these texts it can be found in few places. Consider the examples in (34): addition of the Subordinate mood clitic <p@ (§7.2.7) to G`xt ‘ten’, a base ending in a rounded vowel, produces a form transcribed variously as G`xtp` or G`xtpi`. As previously mentioned, clitic boundaries are treated like word boundaries for purposes of labialization,
so such variation is expected:
(34)G`xtp` or
G`xt<p@G`xtpi`ten=SUBOR‘that there were ten’ (first form at NA 344.20, second at NA 62.33-34)
3.2.3Reduction of vowel sequencesVowel sequences are not permitted. When two vowels come to be adjacent in the course of derivation, the sequence is reduced to a single vowel whose length and quality are determined by the
length and quality of the underlying vowels (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 236-37). The rules for reduction of vowel sequences that involve the first root vowel (i.e. the vowel following the initial37consonant of the root) differ slightly from those for sequences that do not involve the first root
vowel. This involves a bit of morphological conditioning (because the rules need to “know”
whether a vowel is the first vowel of a root –– a morphological rather than phonological question), so reduction of vowel sequences is not a purely phonologically-conditioned process like the
other processes in this section, but it is regular, unlike the morpheme-specific processes described
in §3.3.
3.2.3.1Sequences not involving the first root vowela) The quality of the resultant vowel is determined by the hierarchy t > h > `. The quality will
be /t/ if one of the two underlying vowels is /t/, /h/ if an /h/ but no /t/ is involved, and /`/
only if both underlying vowels are /`/. The order of the underlying vowels is immaterial. Examples are wanting for h*t and `*t sequences due to the scarcity of /t/-initial suffixes.

Predicate heads with no formal aspect marking and no aspectual meaning indicated in the morpheme-by-morpheme gloss may be assumed to be inherently imperfective. Inherent perfective

The predicate is a complex consisting of an obligatory head, clitics coding clause-level categories

Words from most of the classes listed in §4.1 may function as predicate head. (See §4.4.3 for a
classification of clause types according to the word classes of their predicate heads.)
4.3.1Mood and pronominal markingSouthern Wakashan predicates may be mood-marked or “absolute,” i.e. not marked for mood. In
Makah, the first word in a mood-marked predicate hosts a clitic indicating mood. Indicative100mood, the default mood for conversation, is marked by its own set of pronominal clitics. (For the
moment we restrict our attention to predicates containing no predicate modifiers.)

Other moods are generally expressed by a mood clitic followed by a separate pronominal clitic.
The Polar (‘yes/no’) Interrogative mood shown in (165), for example, is marked by the Polar Interrogative clitic <(p)@j plus a set of pronominal clitics in which the first person singular subject form is <r:

In non-Indicative moods, pronominal markers involving first and second persons are transparently structurally distinct from the mood clitics. For third person forms, although a more abstract
analysis is theoretically possible in which the mood markers and pronominal formatives are
sometimes distinct, formal complexities arise that make it more analytically convenient to assume
fused mood-pronominal forms (§7.2.1).

Pronominal clitics (including the fused mood-pronominal combinations) in Makah index at
least the subject and sometimes also one non-subject grammatical role. The non-subject role is
often, but not necessarily, the object.","[114, 115, 116]"
"180His worries about imposition of external categories on the object language are clearly wellfounded, and even today this is a common pitfall of comparative semantic research. Lucy (1994:
624) describes such research as follows:
Lexical items are grouped together [in analyses of this sort] and analyzed as a
coherent set not because speakers of those languages group them together in a set
as revealed, for example, by common grammatical treatment, but because the
analyst so groups them. And meanings are assigned not on the basis of close examination of actual usage, but on the basis of rough functional equivalence with
forms in our own language. Thus an external framework is imposed on the language in place of a framework deriving from its native logic.
Conclusions from these studies are likely to reveal more about the external framework than about
the language under analysis.
Fortunately, we need not content ourselves with a classification of lexical suffixes in Southern Wakashan that is descriptively useful, but ultimately of little value in understanding how the
languages works. We can make use of language internal criteria, both semantic and formal, to
classify the suffixes following “native logic”. Given the importance of the suffixes in the grammar, this is, in fact, an essential task. As we know, however, “all grammars leak”, so there is no
reason to expect every suffix to fit neatly into our classification scheme, whether its logic is native or external. By and large, suffixes do fall fairly clearly into one category or another, but a
few belong to more than one category, and we are left with the inevitable residue of suffixes that
are difficult to classify.
Use of language internal criteria can be demonstrated by considering the status of two ostensibly similar Nuuchahnulth suffixes, ,Ch ‘at, in ...’ and ,BT ‘in a container’. At first glance, one
might think to group these together as “locative” suffixes. However, closer study of their semantic relationship with bases and their effect on the grammatical category of the resultant word
shows that, according to Nootkan logic, they actually belong to different categories. Consider
(275), which shows each suffix with the simple noun root p`FTb ‘pack-basket’ as base.","[195, 196]"

the force of an insult –– such a greeting would normally only be given to a child or slave.
The diminutive can also indicate that a situational element other than a participant is small or
less than expected. Example (453) shows the diminutive used to indicate that the group size of a
plural argument is few.

Certain roots in Nuuchahnulth that denote the lower end of a scale (e.g. F`m`GFhr ‘small’
denotes the lower end of the property SIZE) obligatorily take the diminutive. Compare, for example, the pairs of roots in Table 24.

Roots that denote the upper limit of a scale like FHGi ‘big’ can occur with the diminutive as well,
but with these roots it expresses qualified or partial possession of the property, e.g. FHGFhr ‘fairly
big’.
Use of the diminutive with scalar roots in Makah is not obligatory. When it does occur with a
root in this category, it intensifies the meaning: ji`F`vhRC ‘really small’ (ji`F`ji ‘small’).
As first discussed in Sapir (1915), the Nuuchahnulth diminutive can be used to indicate persons with certain “abnormal” physical characteristics other than small size such as lame people,
left-handed people, those who squint or are cross-eyed, hunchbacks, and others. In these cases the
diminutive acts in concert either with a characteristic and otherwise meaningless consonant cluster that is inserted into the word (e.g. ,QR, plus <Fhr to indicate lameness) or with special articulatory changes that are applied to particular groups of consonants (e.g. to indicate those with a
defect of the eye all sibilants are changed to the corresponding lateral stops or fricatives: /r R/
become /K/, etc.). To cite two of Sapir’s examples, S`MdFhrFh ‘the little child’ becomes305S`QRMdFhrFh to refer to or to address a lame child; similarly, x@KF`Ql` ‘He is yonder now’ (x@K
‘yonder’, <""`Q temporal specifier’, <l@ Indicative mood) becomes x@KCGFhB`Ql` to indicate a left-handed person, which Sapir translates as ‘There now he is, poor little left-handed
chap!’.
7.3.2Intentive future (Nuuchahnulth)<F`9pQ (rarely <""`9pQ) (INTENT): This Nuuchahnulth clitic is typically used as a future tense
marker with the implication, though not the necessity, that the subject or some other participant in
the event has control over whether it comes about.

grandchild–PERF=INTENT=POSS=ART‘his future grandchild’ (NA 77.24)
The intentive future does not co-occur with the other future clitics that appear later in the sequence. Rose (1981) reports that <F`9pQ co-occurs with the irrealis <""`9G and the past tense
clitic<(l)hs in Kyuquot dialect, but examples of either are lacking in the Tseshaht corpus.1083067.3.3Temporal specifier<""`Q (TEMP): This ubiquitous clitic, common to both languages, has a number of subtle functions, all of which derive from its basic function of fixing a situation at a specified time in the
course of events. When translated at all, it is rendered ‘now’, ‘(and) then’, or ‘at that time’.
It often serves as a device for expressing the temporal succession of a series of events. The
first two sentences of the following Nuuchahnulth excerpt from paragraph one of Text 77 (77.1.4
and 77.1.5 below; NA 385) relate two events in narrative sequence. The third sentence (77.1.6)

An important feature of restrictive sequences is that the entire sequence carries a single aspectual value. This is, in fact, one reason for analyzing the series of suffixes as being on the same
level. Aspect is normally indicated by the last morpheme in an unextended word, whether by an
aspect suffix, or by the aspectual value inherent in a word-final lexical suffix or root. In a wordfinal restrictive sequence, however, a path suffix can determine the aspectual value of the word,
even though it may precede a locative suffix in the sequence that otherwise has a different value,
e.g. the verbs in (265)and (266) are perfective because of the path suffix M, N ,jihr,s, ‘move
out, away (perf.)’ despite the presence of the following imperfective locative site suffixes -BT ‘in
a container; in a bay’ and ,""`Gr ‘in a vessel’.

Any number of nuclear suffixes and restrictive sequences may co-occur in a derived word.
For example, the Nuuchahulth verb F`QphlKHbr`S`r ‘carry two round objects out of the woods’
in (267) consists of the numeral root F`Q, ‘two’ plus the nuclear nominalizing suffix ,phlK ‘...
many round objects’, forming the noun F`QphlK ‘two round objects’. This in turn serves as base
for the nuclear verbalizing suffix ,h9br ‘bringing, carrying ...’, forming the verb F`QphlKHbr
‘carrying two round objects’. The word is then capped off by the restrictive sequence ,`s,""`r
‘move out of the woods on the ground’, which, incidentally, is another example of a path suffix
determining aspect despite a following locative suffix.","[183, 184]"
"‘I shall instruct you.’ (NT 60.6)
However, another common strategy is to use a bare absolute predicate to introduce the P argument in a separate clause.

In (466), the A arguments are subjects of the initial clauses, and the P arguments appear as roots
of bare absolute predicates with the verbalizing suffix -(C)hK [L] ‘doing to, with reference to ...’.
Literally, the construction means something like ‘X caused to be awake, doing it to Y’. See
§4.6.1.1 for details on this type of construction.110
We turn now to the use of the passive-inverse in relation to the topicality hierarchy. When
both arguments of a transitive predicate are third person, the more topical of the two is generally
coded as subject, regardless of its role. If the A is more topical, the clause is direct: the A is coded
as subject and the P is coded as object. If, on the other hand, the P is more topical, the clause is
passive-inverse: the P is coded as subject, and the A, if mentioned at all, appears as an oblique
agent RP. In syntactic terms, the passive-inverse clitic on the predicate head signals that the P
rather than the A is subject. In discourse terms, it signals that the A is less topical than the P.",[327]

symbolized ‘(K)’. The lateral fricative is later deleted by a morpheme-specific final consonant deletion rule (79). See §3.3.7.

All the examples we have seen so far have glottalizing suffixes following consonants. They
can also follow vowels, in which case a glottal stop is inserted. This is often lost later in the derivation (§3.3.4) (but the glottal stop in examples like (79) is not subject to deletion, §3.3.7), e.g.

Why not simply analyze glottalizing suffixes as suffixes with initial glottal stops? This
straightforward solution is prevented by the existence of suffixes with initial glottal stops that
never trigger the effects described above, e.g. ,F`st [L] ‘sink (perf.)’ and ,-FTjs ‘obtained by57...’.22 These suffixes always appear with glottal stops (which may be lost later in the derivation)
and have no effect on preceding sounds. (The period diacritic in ,-FTjs ‘obtained by’ is explained in §3.3.4).

The unextended word in (150), the verb M, N vdFhC ‘sleeping’, contains no lexical suffixes or
aspectual morphemes –– it is a bare root.

In (151)a, the Makah verb is composed of vdFhC, functioning as the base, plus a lexical suffix,
the locative suffix -""`Wr ‘in a vessel’. The verb in (151)b is composed of the bound verb root
F`bj`s, ‘jump’ as base plus -""`Wr and the perfective aspect suffix -hQ.

base and suffixes, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Not indicated in Figure 1 is the fact that words may also be marked as plural or distributive
by reduplication, infixation, or some combination of the two. Such plural/distributive marking is
grammatically optional and subject to many formal irregularities. See §5.5.4 for examples.
Depending on its syntactic role and position in a sentence, the morphological construct of
base + lexical suffixes + aspect (called the “unextended” word by Swadesh 1933, 1939) can take
additional formatives known variously as “incremental suffixes” (Swadesh 1933, Sapir &
Swadesh 1939), “word suffixes” (Swadesh 1939), “inflectional suffixes” (Rose 1981), or
“peripheral suffixes” (Nakayama 1997a) to form an “extended” word. Such formatives express
clause-level grammatical categories like tense, mood, voice, and pronominal indexes.
Though all the aforementioned authors refer to these formatives as “suffixes” of one type or
another, their status as such is actually rather ambivalent. They differ from lexical and aspect suffixes on a number of phonological, morphological, and semantic points (see Chapter 7 for a summary list). Some researchers (e.g. Klokeid 1976, 1978, Jacobsen 1979a: 151, note 31, Renker
1987) have suggested that these formatives in Ditidaht and Makah are actually clitics (an analysis
that extends easily to Nuuchahnulth as well).47 This idea appears to account for a number of their
syntactic properties.
The unextended word carries the lexical (dictionary) meaning of the word, while the clitics
specify values for grammatical categories associated with the word in its syntactic context. As
Swadesh (1933: 11) puts it for Nuuchahnulth: “From the lexical point of view, the word is the
unextended unit composed of stem plus derivational and aspect suffixes. From the syntactic point
of view, the word is the total phonetic unity, sometimes identical with the lexical unit, sometimes
more or less extended by [enclitic] elements.” In (153), for example, Makah vdFhE`k ‘he/she/it is95sleeping’ is formed from the verb vdFhC ‘sleep’ plus the temporal specifier clitic <""`Q glossed
“TEMP” (explained in §4.3.2 below) and<?h, the third person singular Indicative mood clitic.
(153)MAKAHvdFhE`k
vdFhC<""`Q<?h
sleep=TEMP=INDIC.3sg‘He/she/it is sleeping.’
In general, words functioning as predicate heads in main clauses have the greatest potential for
hosting clitics. The clitics occur in an ordered sequence of slots following their host (§7.5). First
come clitics coding categories like the causative, passive-inverse, and tense. Next are mood and
pronominal clitics indexing subjects and, in Makah, some non-subjects. As seen in (153), third
person formatives in Makah have fused with mood clitics. In Nuuchahnulth, there is no marking
for third person in most moods. Finally, a word may end with one or more clitics drawn from a
small post-modal set that includes a morpheme expressing the plurality of a third person participant, a morpheme meaning ‘again’, and a habitual marker. See §4.3 for more on clitics and their
place in the structure of the predicate.
4.2.2Lexical suffixesThe 500 or so lexical suffixes can be divided into two main types (§5.3). The first type, nuclear
suffixes (§5.4), includes nominalizing suffixes (154) and verbalizing suffixes (155):
(154)Examples of nominalizing suffixesM ,`Bhr, N ,`Btr ‘surface, platform for ...’
M ,HshFh9, N ,Hs` ‘... -er’
M ,(j)r`b, N ,(b)r`b ‘container, vessel for ...’
M ,x`ji, N ,X`ji ‘thing, instrument for ...’
(155)Examples of verbalizing suffixesM ,`a`9Bt, N ,l`Btj ‘talking about ...’M, N ,Jtj [R] ‘resembling ...’96M ,Bhr, N ,Btr [L] ‘laughing at ...’M, N ,O`K ‘smelling like ...’M ,c@ji, N ,m@ji ‘having ...’M ,rta`C, N ,rhlC [L] ‘do ritual for ...’M ,hctW, N ,M@G ‘seeking ...’M ,tF`K, N ,(x)tF`K ‘perceive ... (perf.)’The second type, restrictive suffixes (§5.5), consists mostly of suffixes indicating spatial disposition including path-orientation suffixes (156) and locative suffixes (157):
(156)Examples of path-orientation suffixesM, N ,(-F)`K ‘attached on’
M ,@xhQ, N ,`xh9FhQ ‘enter a building (perf.)’
M, N -jihr,s, ‘move away from (perf.)’
M ,a`K,, N ,l`K, ‘moving about’
N ,MHp, ‘down a slope (perf.)’
(157)Examples of locative suffixesM ,""`Wr, N -""`Gr ‘in a vessel’
M, N ,@rB` ‘on the roof’
N ,hmjrS`r ‘at the back of the head’
M ,`chK, N ,(v)hmK [L] ‘on the neck’
M ,(j)rF`shFh9, N ,(b)rF`st [L] ‘at the door’
At least since Sapir (1924) ellipses, i.e. the symbol “...”, have been included in the glosses of
nuclear suffixes to indicate the relation of the meaning of the suffix to that of the base, that is,
where the meaning of the base “fits” in the meaning of the suffix. Ellipses are not used in glosses
of restrictive suffixes because they have essentially additive relations with bases that are always
semantically predictable. In this dissertation nuclear ellipses are used only with glosses in the
body of the text and not in morpheme-by-morpheme glosses for reasons of economy.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112]"
"134Existentials in which the location is expressed by a following verb –– e.g. (218)a,c-d –– are in
essence multi-clausal reversals of a mono-clausal construction having the locational verb as the
sole predicate head and the nominal expression as its subject. (218)c-d, for instance, could be expressed equally well with such a mono-clausal sentence:

Nominal predicates containing restrictive path-orientation or locative suffixes are a special
case. They are often atransitive existentials (in (218)b,e-g, for example). In some cases, however,
they are intransitive with personal subject reference. In this use, the subject referent is asserted to
have some relation with the referent of the nominal base that can be loosely referred to as possession.57 Schematically: ‘X [subject referent] has Y [referent of nominal base] at Z [location denoted by suffix(es)]’. I call this the possessive-existential (or bahuvrihi) reading. Consider the
examples in (220).

It is often unclear whether a third person referent in a sentence with a restricted nominal predicate
(i.e. a predicate containing a predicate head with a restrictive locative suffix) is to be interpreted
as the subject of the predicate (triggering a possessive-existential reading) or as a locative adjunct
expanding the reference of the restrictive suffix(es) (triggering a simple existential reading). This
ambiguity exists in (220)c, for example. The source translates the sentence assuming the first
reading, as if M@r`otKFh ‘a day screen (a board with a painting depicting a mythological subject
on it)’ were the subject of the nominal predicate ptF`bF`BtK F`Q`F`BtK ‘(be) two people on a
surface’, but it is just as likely to be a locative RP expanding the reference of ,-F@Bt(K), that is,
an adjunct further specifying the identity of the surface the two people are on. The alternative
readings are ‘a day screen has two people on it’ and ‘there are two people on a day screen’. Another ambiguous Nuuchahnulth example is shown in (221). This sentence is especially interesting
because it contains two restricted nominal predicates. The first is the main complex predicate
head b`pHbs`phlKBt l@sl@r ‘twenty tribes in a container’; the second is the relative clause
x`Y`pQMtj ‘that which is in the hand’, which is adjoined to the demonstrative F`G ‘this’

The relative clause is clearly possessive-existential: the first person pronominal clitic assures us
of that. The question is whether F`G x`Y`pQMtjp`r ‘this that I have in my hand’ is the subject
of the main predicate (translation a) or an adjunct RP expanding the reference of the locative suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ (translation b).","[149, 150, 151, 152]"
"201They are formally distinguished from site suffixes by three main criteria:
1. All four have suppletive portmanteau perfective aspect allomorphs, e.g. N ,""TQ, perfective of
,""@F` ‘on the rocks’, N ,(#h)ohQ, M ,o`Q, perfective of ,#hK ‘in the house’. Site suffixes do
not have suppletive perfective forms unless they contain one of the locale suffixes as an etymological component, e.g. the site suffix N ,@xHK ‘on a raised platform in the house; in the
sky’, which is probably a fossilized combination of ,@r ‘on a horizontal surface’ and ,#hK ‘in
the house’, has the perfective form ,@xhohQ.
2. Locale suffixes are in paradigmatic opposition; unlike site suffixes, locale suffixes do not cooccur.
3. Locale suffixes always occur last if they appear in sequences of multiple spatial suffixes
unless they are lexicalized as part of the base.
There are also semantic differences between locale and site suffixes. Locale suffixes divide the
world into four broad zones or spheres of activity in which events and objects can be situated
(297). They express the equivalent of Talmy’s (2000) “locale” semantic category, which, in his
words, “pertains to the type of area or physical setting in which an event takes place”. He cites
cognate Kwakwala suffixes as examples of this category. Example (298) shows three Nuuchahnulth words with N ,""@F`, M ,""@.

The property word F@prF`st ‘wide (door)’ in (301)a is an example of a secondary, classificatory function in both Nuuchahnulth and Makah performed by locative suffixes. In this use, a
locative suffix attaches to a predicate head to index or classify its overt or implied subject, e.g. the
locale suffix ,""@F` ‘on the rocks’ attached to N lhK-, ‘smooth’ in (302) forms N lhKF@F`
‘smooth (said of a rock)’, which is predicated of the noun N LtjrXh ‘rock’.

lhK-Ê""@F`<FHLtjrXhwwww
LtjrXhsmooth–on.rocks=ARTrock‘the smooth rock’ (NT 94.27)
The classificatory use contrasts with the more usual locative function, in which the suffix specifies the location of the subject rather than its type. The regular locative function of ‘on the rocks’
is, in fact, also shown in the very sentence from which the RP in (302) was drawn. Attached to
the main predicate head, the suffix (in its suppletive perfective form) specifies the location of the204subject (Pitch-Woman); the classificatory reading is obviously nonsensical here: she is not asserted to be a supine rock.

Use of classificatory locatives appears to be always grammatically optional, although it may be
stylistically preferred in certain contexts. That is, one could probably say simply lhK`jFh LtjrXh
‘smooth rock’ (with the durative aspect suffix on lhK-,).
It is not known how may locative suffixes have this classificatory function, but there are almost certainly more than those represented in (304). Jacobsen (1996: 12) records two Makah examples of classificatory locatives: F`P`r ‘wide (of a road)’, F`P`Wr ‘wide (of canoe, house)’. It
is likely that the Nuuchahnulth cognates (,""`r and ,""`Gr) allow classificatory use as well..
5.5.3Degree suffixesThere are a half dozen or so restrictive degree suffixes, all of which appear to be peripheral suffixes. These are N ,(p)`p ,`p`p [often S+S], M ,(j)KFhs ‘very, big’, N, M ,`9oh [LR+S] ‘too
much, too ...’, N ,bJhm, M ,bJhc` ‘slightly’, N -(p)GKh ‘excessively’, N, M ,r` ,r`r` [usually L
or L+S] ‘precisely, very, too, really, just’, and N ,S`9m` ,S`m` ‘slightly’.","[216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"
"4.5 Referring phrases
Referring phrases in Southern Wakashan may be divided into two types according to whether
they contain a relative root like M x`p@, N x`pi ‘one who, that which’. We first discuss simple
RPs, i.e. RPs that do not contain such a root.
4.5.1Simple RPsThere are striking similarities in the structure of simple RPs and the structure of clauses that are
neatly explained by an analysis in which such RPs are, in effect, nothing but “nominalized”
clauses, that is, clauses made into referring expressions; or, put more formally, referring phrases
are headless relative clauses.58 The entity denoted by a simple RP is equivalent to the subject of
the corresponding non-nominalized clause. Key to this analysis is the idea that the morpheme I
have glossed thus far as an article M <?hp, N <FH is a type of relative mood marker.59 This is
supported by the fact that the article is in a relation of absolute paradigmatic exclusivity with the
other mood markers (cf. (212)b above). Predicate clitics thus naturally appear in “referring
clauses” just as they do in ordinary main clauses, with the exception that only the article (or, in
Nuuchahnulth, its quotative counterpart <(l)hE` <E@ ‘the reputed, the one they speak of’) may
appear in the mood slot of the clitic sequence. Thus, the RPs in the a. examples below are claimed137to have the same structure and grammatical relationships among words as the clauses in the b.
examples. That is, M w`cF`ji ‘girl’ is predicate head in both (222)a-b, M vdFhC ‘sleeping’ is
predicate head in (223)a-b and w`cF`ji ‘girl’ is its subject, and so on.

A simple RP (with the article) can include any elements (subjects, objects, obliques, adverbial
clauses, complement clauses, etc.) that an ordinary clause can. As (229)i demonstrates, an RP
may be preceded (or more rarely, followed) by a demonstrative. The article attaches to the first
non-demonstrative word of the RP, precisely as a mood clitic attaches to the first word of the
predicate in an ordinary clause.","[152, 153, 154]"
