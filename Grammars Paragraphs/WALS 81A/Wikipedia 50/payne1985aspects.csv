"Basic constituent order is VSO (order of direct object and
oblique may vary).
Fronting of NP's (or other elements) to the left of the verb
is a possibility under pragmatically marked conditions.
There is a tendency to move given information to end of the
clause (relative to the order of direct object and oblique).
The language is agglutinative and polysynthetic.
There is essentially no nominal case marking for subject and
object (but Set II clitics have case/pronominal features).
Relative clauses are post-head.
Descriptive modifiers are post-head.",[407]

various
factors19 In Tables 6.15 and 6.16 I have factored out those cases where
the oblique is jasiy 'there’'. Jaésiy has almost an adverbial sense
in
many cases indicating sequentiality rather than a clearly referential
location. It almost exclusively precedes 0, regardless of
whether
0
is
encoded
with an noun phrase or a clitic, and whether O is given,
new, definite,- or indefinite.20 although Tables 6.15 and 6.16 both have 44 tokens each, these
sets
of
tokens
are
not
identical.
In some instances a given-new
combination might also encode definite-definite information. Thus the
particular
case
would be represented in Table 6.15 but not in Table
6.16. This explains
why there are 23 cases
of OP and 21 of
PO
order
in Table 6.15, but 27 cases of OP amd 17 of PO order in Table 6.16.

are misleading in some of the other cases.
For
example when clitics encode both 0 and P, PO order occurs in
