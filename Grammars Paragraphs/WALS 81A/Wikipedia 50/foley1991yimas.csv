-The Yimas Language
of New Guinea1The Language and Its Speakers1 . 1 Linguistic Type
Yimas belongs to the grouping of languages spoken in the Pacific known
as Papuan languages .. Languages of the New Guinea area are generally
divided into two large groupings: Austronesian languages and Papuan
languages. The Austronesian languages all belong to the far-flung Aus­
tronesian language family, stretching east to west from Southeast Asia
to Hawaii, and north to south from Formosa to New Zealand. Most of
the roughly 250 Austronesian languages of the New Guinea area (and
all of those in Papua New Guinea) belong to a single subgroup of the
family known as the Oceanic subgroup.
Papuan languages are quite different in this respect. The 750 or so
Papuan languages do not constitute a single, genetically unified language
family, but rather are organized into about sixty different language fam­
ilies averaging ten member languages each. With much more careful and
detailed comparative work, some of these language families will undoubt­
edly be combined into larger genetic groupings, as the Celtic, Germanic,
and Slavic language families among others have been combined to form
the Indo-European language family. Wurm (1982) presents some hy­
potheses in this direction, but at this point nearly all of these need to
be verified by careful comparative work.
With so many Papuan language families composed of so many dis­
tinct languages, it is very difficult to describe what a 'typical' Papuan
language is, as all generalizations will be contradicted by one language
or indeed one language family. Nonetheless, I attempted just this in
Foley 1986, and I will summarize here how Yimas fits with the charac­
terizations of Papuan languages proposed in that work. Yimas is one
of six member languages of the Lower Sepik family (see Section 1 .4 for
more discussion of the family, as well as Foley 1986, 214-29). As with
12THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSthe other languages of the family, it is morphologically agglutinative,
employing both prefixes and suffixes. Word order is highly variable and
quite free, although some other languages in the family have a weak
preference for Subject/ Object/Verb.
The phonological inventory of Yimas is small, even by the stan­
dards of Papuan languages, having only 12 consonants and 4 vowels.
The phonology exhibits many features typical of Sepik area languages.
There are no fricative phonemes; [s] is just an allophonic realization of
the voiceless palatal stop / c /. The language distinguishes four places of
articulation: bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar, with a corresponding
voiceless stop and nasal in each position. There is no voiced/voiceless
distinction for stops, the voiced stops being allophonic realizations of the
voiceless stops in certain positions, such as following nasals. Unusually
for a Papuan language, Yimas has an r/l distinction, but the /1/ is always
palatal(ized) , i.e., [lY] or [.A] , and the /r/ is always dental-alveolar, to a
large extent varying freely between [l] and [r] as phonetic realizations.
The vocalic system is typically-one might say prototypically-Sepik.
There is a dearth of vowel phonemes, both abstractly and as the seg­
mental phonemes of particular words. Many words lack underlying vowel
phonemes altogether, and the string of underlying consonants is broken
up in phonetic realization by epenthetic vowels inserted by a phonolog­
ical rule. The only clear unambiguous underlying vowel in the language
is the low central vowel fa/. The three high vowels /i, i, uj are often the
result of vowel epenthesis, the /i/ almost invariably so. The semivowels
jyj and jwj, especially the latter, interact closely with the phonological
rules involving vowels, such that their phonetic realization is often the
result of these rules. Stress is predictable and generally occurs initially.
Yimas has two major word classes, noun and verb. In addition to
these, there are eight minor categories: adjective, quantifier, locational,
temporal, pronoun, deictic, conjunction, and interjection. There are
only three true adjectives in Yimas; other roots corresponding to adjec­
tives in English belong to the major classes of verb and noun. Quantifiers
must be treated as a separate word class from adjectives in Yimas due to
their highly divergent morphology. Locationals and temporals are two
adverb-like parts of speech, expressing the spatial and temporal orien­
tations of events. They both share some of the features of nouns, such
as the occasional ability to pluralize. The number distinctions of Yimas
pronouns are much richer than in most other Papuan languages. In ad­
dition to the usual three persons, Yimas pronouns distinguish four num­
bers: singular, dual, paucal (a few), and plural (more than a few). De­
ictics exhibit a three-way distinction: place near the speaker, place near
the addressee, and place near neither of these. There are over sixty ofLINGUISTIC TYPE3these deictic forms; besides deictic distance, they distinguish noun class
and number of the nominal designating the object whose position they
describe. Like most Papuan languages, Yimas has a very restricted set
of conjunctions (some languages in the central highlands of Papua New
Guinea lack them entirely). There are no subordinating conjunctions
and only two coordinating conjunctions, equivalent to 'and' and 'but'.
Nouns in Yimas are characterized by being divided into ten major
classes, plus a few idiosyncratic classes. The criteria for assignment to
noun class are both semantic and phonological. Nouns are obligato­
rily inflected for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) , with the
morphemes indicating number highly variable according to noun class.
Suppletion of the noun stem in the plural form is common. The only
other inflection available to nouns is case, and for this there is only a
single oblique case inflection, which marks nouns functioning in an in­
strumental or locative role. Possession is marked by a particle postposed
to the possessor.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex word class in Yimas,
and they are highly so; about half of this grammar is devoted to verb
morphology. Because of this complexity, Yimas can properly be char­
acterized as an agglutinative polysynthetic language, equal in most re­
spects to the much discussed polysynthetic languages of the Americas.
The verb can occur with many prefixes and suffixes, with the former pre­
dominating. The suffixes largely express notions of tense, aspect, and
mood. The language is very rich in this area, marking, for example, eight
distinct tenses. There are five potentially filled suffixal slots to the verb.
The prefixes are more numerous, with eight potentially filled positions.
The prefixes express notions like modality; agreement for noun class, per­
son and number of core nominals like subject, direct object, and indirect
object (this information can also be expressed by suffixes in some envi­
ronments) ; adverbial notions like place, direction, duration and manner;
and finally, valence alternations to the verb like reciprocal formation,
causativization and applicative verb formation (see Comrie 1985). An­
other common feature of verbs is verb compounding, or serialization.
This is done at the word level, as shown by the fact that the whole set
of verbal prefixes and suffixes flank these compounded verbal forms.
Pronouns in Yimas are not inflected. True pronouns only exist for
first- and second-persons; the so-called third-person independent pro­
nouns are actually deictics, and distinguish noun class and number.
Pronouns are actually rather infrequently used in Yimas, for the simple
reason that the verb has pronominal affixes for the subject, direct object,
and indirect object of the clauses. These affixes exhibit a very complex
1wrson-bascd split for their case-marking schema. First- and second-4THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSperson forms follow an underlying nominative/accusative pattern, and
third-person forms, something like an ergative/absolutive one.
Word order in Yimas is remarkably free, even in comparison to
the relative freedom exhibited by other Papuan languages. Within the
clause, there is no set word order pattern at all (in fact, the majority
of clauses consist of just a verb, so word order is not much of a ques­
tion in these cases anyway) . The verb has a slight tendency to occur
last in a pragmatically unmarked context, with the preceding nominals
in any order, but it is common for a nominal to occur after the verb
with a slightly marked pragmatic force. Word order in Yimas is so free
that noun phrases need not even form a constituent. Yimas exhibits
the 'scrambled' pattern of noun phrases, well known from Australian
languages, in which a noun and its modifiers can be separated from one
another within the clause. In these cases, the modifiers obligatorily take
concord affixes for the noun class and number of the noun they modify.
Yimas contrasts with many other Papuan languages in making less
extensive use of clause chaining (Foley 1986). Yimas completely lacks a
productive morphological system of switch reference: the same form of a
medial dependent verb form can be used before another verb regardless
of whether they share the same subject or not. The most common type
of clause linkage in Yimas involves nominalization, both finite and non­
finite. Finite nominalizations in Yimas correspond to relative and ad­
verbial subordinate clauses in more familiar languages, while non-finite
nominalizations are like infinitive complements and gerunds. Yimas can
also link clauses through coordination, by simple juxtaposition, or by
using one of its two conjunctions.
Yimas discourse strikes an English speaker as very dense. Because
of the pronominal agreement affixes, overt nominals are rare and carry
strong contrastive emphasis. This results in the text often consisting
of little more than verbs over long stretches. The highly incorporating,
agglutinative morphology of the verb further contributes to this impres­
sion of density: much information is carried by the bound affixes of the
verb, in contrast to the independent words of a language like English.
This can put heavy processing loads on the hearer in trying to decipher
a verb consisting of ten morphemes.
Yimas is spoken in two villages, totaling about 250 people. One vil­
lage is the original village site, and the other has only recently hived
off from that village, since 1970 or so. There is constant traveling back
and forth between the two villages, most people spending some time
each year in both. Only a small minority live exclusively in one or the
other village, but even these make day trips between the two, which are
separated by about 15 km. Because of this situation, there is no geo-LINGUISTIC TYPE5graphically based dialect differentiation in the Yimas language. There is,
however, significant socially based differentiation according to age. All
speakers under 40 have grown up bilingual in Tok Pisin, and this has
influenced their Yimas to a greater or lesser extent. Even older male
speakers who grew up monolingually in Yimas and learned Tok Pisin
while serving stints as recruited plantation labor show this influence to
some extent. Older women speak the least affected Yimas and show the
lowest degree of fluency in Tok Pisin.
Tok Pisin is the prestige language and its influence on Yimas has two
effects. First, Tok Pisin words are borrowed into Yimas. This borrowing
may be so heavy that the speaker's talk may resemble a code switching­
like discourse, containing snatches of Yimas followed by Tok Pisin. In
other cases, Tok Pisin forms are borrowed into what is otherwise pure
Yimas. These may be nativized to such an extent that speakers are
unaware of the words' ancestry. Second, the very complex morphology
of Yimas is subject to simplification. Verbs have fewer morpheme slots
filled, and irregular and suppletive forms are regularized. In some cases
these irregular forms may be lost altogether. For example, almost no
speakers under 40 can completely control the highly complex and irreg­
ular numeral system. In daily use these are replaced by the Tok Pisin
numbers. The whole impression of the Yimas of younger speakers is its
simplicity and regularity relative to the highly complex and irregular
language of older (especially female) speakers. The language described
principally in this grammar is of men now in their late thirties, who
grew up in an almost purely monolingual Yimas environment, and who
speak a relatively rich and elaborate version of the language. Regular­
izations and changes in the speech of younger speakers will be noted
when relevant.
The influence of Tok Pisin on Yimas is now reaching its logical out­
come among the very young. Many young children in the Yimas commu­
nities, especially those under seven years of age, are not learning Yimas
at all and are certainly growing up with Tok Pisin as their first language.
Whether they will learn Yimas as a second language around ten years
of age or slightly older is not clear at the moment, but this seems un­
likely, given the status attached to Tok Pisin (Foley 1986, 27-8) and the
great morphological complexity of Yimas, which puts a great burden on
simple memory in language acquisition. In traditional times, the single
greatest intellectual task facing a Yimas child was probably learning his
language. But now with schooling and other Western accoutrements,
there are other claims on his time. It is perhaps too early to say that
the Yimas language is dying, but it must be admitted that the prognosis
is not good.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
"194BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYNote that the word order in both these sentences is exactly the same,
and further that neither of the nouns have any case marking affixes. Yet
their meanings are contrastive. This meaning difference is carried by
the different choice of verbal prefixes. In the first example, the prefixes
indicate a singular object and a plural subject. The associated plural
noun payum 'men' must therefore be the subject, and the singular noun
narmav 'woman' the object, resulting in 'the men saw the woman'. In
the (b) example, the inflectional pattern of the prefixes is the opposite,
indicating a singular subject and a plural object. Hence, the singular
noun narmav 'woman' must now be the subject and the plural noun
payum 'men', the object, expressing the meaning 'the woman saw the
men'. Note that the verbal affixes signal the grammatical relations of
core nominals rather indirectly: they associate a grammatical relation
with a certain person/number combination. The noun which matches
this person/number combination is then interpreted as filling the gram­
matical relation. If the person/number combinations of the pronominal
affixes are the same, ambiguous sentences may result.
(5-2) panmal narma!J
na-n-tay
man I SG woman II SG 3SG 0-3SG A-see
'The man saw the woman.' or
'The woman saw the man.'
Noun class distinctions may come to the rescue in many cases. This
does not help in (5-2) because, although the two nouns belong to dif­
ferent classes (classes I and II) the verbal prefixes for these clauses are
identical. If, however, the object were a class VI noun, the ambiguity
would disappear.
k-n-tay
narma!J
(5-3) kray!J
frog VI SG woman II SG VI SG 0-3SG A-see
'The woman saw the frog. '
* 'The frog saw the woman.'
The prefix k- VI SG is unambiguously associated with kray'f) 'frog',
which thereby must function as the object. The subject narmav 'woman'
is similarly identified by the prefix n- 3SG A. Hence (5-3) is unambiguous
and can only mean 'the woman saw the frog'.
I have been using the terms subject and object thus far in the exposi­
tion in a pre-theoretical and undefined way. These notions as understood
from the prism of English grammar are not entirely straightforward when
extended to Yimas. The notion of subject in English confiates the sub­
ject of an intransitive and a transitive verb and contrasts these to the
object of a transitive verb. Note, for example, that for the third person
singular masculine pronoun, English uses the same form for the sub-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS195ject of a transitive and an intransitive verb, but a different form for the
object of a transitive verb:
(5-4) a. He runs.
b. He hit him.
This English way of marking grammatical relations is called a nomin­
ative-accusative system, in which the nominative is the form for the
subject of the intransitive and transitive verb, and the accusative is the
form of the object of the transitive verb. In a system like this, subject is a
well defined notion in that it always corresponds to the nominative form.
Object is equally well defined, always corresponding to the accusative
form.
Yimas is not so straightforward, and the system of grammatical re­
lations as assigned by the prefixes cannot be so simply characterized.
Different person/number combinations work in different ways, but none
align grammatical relations exactly as in English. The prefixes asso­
ciated with third person participants vary in form according to their
position in the verb. There is one form for initial position and another
for non-initial position, as in (5-5):
(5-5) a. pu-wa-t
3PL S-go-PERF
'He went . '
b. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them.'
* 'They saw him. '
c. na-mpu-tay
3SG 0-3PL A-see
'They saw him.'
* 'He saw them.'
Note that when both prefixes refer to third person participants, this
schema based on linear order amounts in essence to an ergative-absolu­
tive marking system. The form pu- 3PL is used for the subject of an
intransitive verb (5-5a) and also functions for the object of a transitive
verb (5-5b) . On the other hand, the subject of the transitive verb has
the unique form mpu- 3PL. (I adopt Dixon's ( 1979) symbolism of S for
the subject of an intransitive verb, A for the subject of a transitive verb
and 0 for its object). We may diagram this contrast in the alignment
of grammatical relations between English and Yimas in the following
terms:196BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY
English:S: he
A: heS: pu-Yimas:
0: himnominative-accusativeA: mpu-0: pu-ergative-absolutiveThe ergative form is that for the A, the subject of the transitive verb­
in this Yimas example, mpu- 3PL. The absolutive corresponds to the
S, the subject of the intransitive verb, and the 0, the object of the
transitive verb-in this case, the prefix pu- 3PL. Note that at least in
these morphological terms, the notion of subject as employed in English
is not applicable to Yimas, for it fails to align A, S, and 0 in the way in
which this term is normally understood.
In fact the situation is more complex than this, for with the first
and second person prefixes, A, S, and 0 typically do not conflate at all,
each one of them having a distinct form, as in these examples of the first
person singular prefixes:
(5-6) a. ama-wa-t
lSG S-go-PERF
'I went.'
b. pu- ka-tay
3PL 0-lSG A-see

'They saw me.'
For the first person singular, ama- is the form for the S, ka- for A, and va­
for 0. (The alert reader will have noted the form pu- for A instead of the
expected mpu-; this is because it occurs initially. As mentioned above,
the form of the third person pronominal prefixes is largely determined
by linear order, as will be discussed in detail below.) These forms for
first singular contrast with those of third plural presented earlier in that
they do not display an ergative system. Instead of aligning S and 0 as
against A as do the third plural forms (pu- S , 0; mpu- A), all three are
distinct. This presents an equally difficult problem for extending the
English notion of subject to Yimas, for again the S fails to align with
A, the morphological defining characteristic of the notion subject for
English and for languages generally with nominative-accusative marking
conventions for grammatical relations.
Having said this, however, there is in fact some morphological evi­
dence in Yimas for a notion of subject along the lines of English. This
evidence appears in secondary verbal forms, particularly those with one
of the modal prefixes (see Section 5.2.2). When one of these modal pre-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS197fixes is added to a. verb which normally would occur with the S prefix
form, the prefix actually appears as the A form.

'I fell down. '
b. ant-ka-tmuk-t
POT-lSG A-fall-PERF
'I almost fell down. '
c.* ant-va-tmuk-t
POT-lSG 0-fall-PERF
(5-7a) is a straightforward verbal form with no modal prefixes in which
the S argument is indicated by the normal S form ama-. (5-7b) is a verb
inflected with the prefix for potential modality ant-, and the S argument
is inflected with the normal A form ka- instead of the expected S form
ama-. As (5-7c) indicates, the 0 prefix va- is ungrammatical in this
construction. Thus, in this construction the S argument surfaces with
the A prefix, rather than the 0 form, demonstrating a clear conflation of
S and A, that is, a nominative-accusative alignment reflecting a notion
of subject much like that of English.
The third person prefixes diverge here. When a modal prefix is added
to a verb with a third person S form prefix, this remains and does not
convert to an A prefix.

3PL S-fall-PERF
'They fell down'
b. a-pu-tmuk-r-um
POT-3PL S-fall-PERF-PL
'They almost fell down. '
In (5-8a) , a verbal form without any modal prefix, the normal absolu­
t.ive form pu-, is used to indicate S. When the verb is inflected with the
potential modal prefix ant- (with the allomorph a- for third plural) , the
S form pu- is still used to indicate the S argument, unlike the compara­
ble situation for first and second person S arguments, which would be
i ndicated with the A prefix forms (compare (5-7b)) . So while the first
and second persons betray in their modally inflected verbs an underlying
nominative-accusative argument alignment, the third person does not,
the absolutive form being used in both normal and modally inflected
verbs.
It has already been mentioned that linear order imposes the primary
constraints on the form of verbal prefixes, particularly the third person198BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYones. The pronominal prefixes are normally the initial prefixes to a verb.
The only prefixes which may ever precede them are the modal prefixes.
,
For third person participants, Yimas requires the order 0 prefix-A prefix:
for example, for two third plural participants, pu-mpu- 3PL 0-3PL A.
Yimas has an additional stipulation (to be discussed in detail in the
following section) that the highest participant on a person hierarchy
1 > 2 > 3 should appear to the right, closest to the verb stem. Thus,
in constructions involving a third person A and a first or second person
0, the A will actually appear on the left, in initial position, outranked
for the rightmost position by the 0. Whenever this happens, the third
person A will actually surface in what is typically the 0 prefix form, as
in the following example:
(5-9) pu-nan-tay
3PL A-2SG O-see
'They saw you.'
The prefix pu- 3PL is actually the usual S/0 prefix form, being used
for A because it is in initial position. The normal corresponding A form
would be ungrammatical in this environment.
(5-10) a. * mpu-nan-tay
3PL A-2SG O-see
Interestingly, for some unknown reason, the third plural A form and only
this form may optionally appear in initial position if the 0 is first person
singular.
b. mpu-JJa-tay
1PL A-1SG O-see
'They saw me.'
There is no explanation forthcoming for this anomaly, but it does demon­
strate that the rules determining the forms of the prefixes cannot be
completely put down to linear order. Clearly, (5-lOb) supports the con­
tention that the basic underlying alignment for the third person prefixes
is ergative-absolutive, or A ( mpu-) versus S, 0 (pu- ).
Now when modal prefixes occur, they always occupy the initial prefix
position. Any co-occurring third person prefix must occur in the second
position, the position normally associated with the A form. Yet any
third person participant functioning as S will still surface with the S
prefix form in a verb inflected with a modal prefix.

will be written as nawkwan and kawkawpwi, respectively. This seems
necessary because R spreading in these cases produces a segment w
rather than just rounding the vowel. Finally, initial w as a result of
initial semivowel formation (2-10) will also be orthographically repre­
sented; thus jut/ 'night' becomes orthographic wut. This will not be
done with initial y resulting from the same rule. This difference in or­
thographic convention reflects the more common pronunciation.
Consonants contrast with vowels in the orthography in that their
writing conventions approach their surface phonetic realizations more
closely. This was already mentioned with the case of final stops following
nasals. Any underlying consonant which undergoes a phonological rule
of Section 2.3, such as palatalization (2-3) or liquid strengthening (2-4, 25), will be written as the derived segment, not the underlying one. Thus
jtaJ]kway + takal + k/ 'look after' will be written as tal]kwaycakalk
(palatalization) , fapur/ 'green skink' as aput (final liquid strengthen­
ing) , and /tal + na + k/ 'hold it' as tatJlak (palatalization plus prenasal
liquid strengthening).
�---3Word C lassesYimas has only two major, open classes of words, nouns and verbs; all
other classes are small and closed. The inventory of the closed classes is
the following:
pronouns
deictics
conjunctions
interjectionsadjectives
quantifiers
locationals
temporalsWe can distinguish these word classes by a variety of criteria; both se­
mantic and formal. Often the semantic content of a word class will
determine its range of morphological possibilities. For example, nouns
commonly denote objects. Hence number, the morphological category
for the expression of multiple tokens of an object, and case, the category
which indicates the role an object plays in a given event, are general
inflectional possibilities for nouns. Verbs, on the other hand, denote
states or events. A common morphological category for them is tense,
which expresses the time at which the event occurs. But not all inflec­
tional categories can be explained so straightforwardly: Yimas verbs are
assigned to just one word class, but the language has a rich system of
derivational morphology by which verbs are derived into nouns and ad­
jectives. Adjectives in turn may be derived into adverbs and verbs. No
other parts of speech are derivable. Some choices are just an arbitrary
feature of a particular language. For example, in Yimas number is an in­
flectional category of verbs as well as nouns. Consequently, word classes
cannot be defined in terms of semantic content alone, but we must use
in their definitions a combination of semantic content, morphological
possibilities, and syntactic behavior. This is the procedure that I will
follow in defining each of the Yimas word classes in the sections that
follow.
8!190WORD CLASSES3.1 Nouns
Nouns are the word class which provides an inventory of the objects
of interest in the world (or imagination) of the speakers of a language.
Nouns are employed in discourse to introduce props, entities, and partic­
ipants relevant to the progression of the discourse. They accomplish this
because by the conventions of the language they are symbols associated
with their referents, the real world or imaginary objects which are called
into mind when the noun is uttered in discourse.
The natural world, as well as the human creations of the social and
cultural worlds, presents a vast array of entities which may be con­
ventionally expressed by nouns. Each language group, according to its
interests, its ecological niche, its social and cultural forms, selects from
this range and codes a subset of it in its system of nouns. However, the
system of nouns is still always large and is invariably the largest word
class in a language. This is undoubtedly true of Yimas, in which the set
of nouns is much larger than the next largest word class, verbs.
Because nouns are typically employed in discourse to introduce or
mention props or participants, they are associated with syntactic func­
tions which describe these participants or express their roles. Nouns fill
the functions of grammatical relations such as subject and object and are
associated with the category of case, which expresses the syntactic roles
of participants. For example, Yimas has a single case marker, an oblique
case suffix - n ""' - nan, which indicates locations, times or instruments
(see Section 4.2). This is a common inflection for noun stems:
(3-1) nam-n
tmat-jlan
wanwa-n
rna
house-OBL
other sun-OBL
knife-OBL
'with a knife'
'on another day'
'in the house'
Nouns also function as the subject and object of a verb. Nouns in
these functions are not inflected for case, but do agree in person and
number with the verb. Their agreement is indicated by a set of verb
prefixes (0 indicates the object of a transitive verb and A, its subject;
see Section 5.1.1).
(3-2) a. narmau namat pu-n-tu-t
woman men
3PL 0-3SG A-kill-PERF
'The woman killed the men.'
b. narmau namat na-mpu-tu-t
woman men
3SG 0-3PL A-kill-PERF
'The men killed the woman.'
The word order of the nouns in Yimas is free, so order does not sig­
nal their syntactic functions as it does in English (compare the English
translations of the above examples). Rather this is indicated by the pre-91NOUNSfixes t o the verb. The sequence o f prefixes in (3-2a) pu-n- indicates a
singular subject and a plural object, so the plural noun in the sentence
namat 'men' is the subject, and the singular noun narmav 'woman' is
the object. The opposite situation obtains in (3-2b) where the prefix
sequence na-mpu- indicates a singular object and a plural subject.
The morphology of nouns will be treated in greater detail in Chapter
4, so I will only mention here some basic morphological defining char­
acteristics. All nouns except for proper names are inflected for three
numbers-singular, dual and plural-and are assigned to a single noun
class. It is this last feature which distinguishes nouns from adjectives
or deictics. Adjectives and deictics vary over the whole range of noun
classes, co-occurring with all possible number/class suffixes. Nouns dif­
fer in being uniquely assigned to a class and taking the number/ class
suffixes specific to that class. Contrast the adjective ma 'other', occur­
ring with a number of different number/class suffixes, with the class VI
noun kav 'shell':

many common nouns have suppletive forms to mark number, i.e., the
singular and plural forms have different stems (in all these cases the dual
form is derived regularly from the singular stem) . This generally applies
to nouns referring to human beings, some animals and other important
objects. Consider the following small sample:

'bird'

two possible inflections, the number/class markers and the oblique case
suffix -n ,...., - nan . The morphology of nouns is exclusively suffixal, while
that of verbs is both prefixal and suffixal. Nouns are inherently assigned
to a given class and are marked for number by a set of number suffixes
which vary for class.

yakiaura-3.2 Verbs
Verbs contrast with nouns in that they are the word class which denote
events or states. While objects, especially those in the natural world,
exist in their own right, this is not true of events or states. These only
manifest themselves by virtue of some object or objects undergoing or
performing them. The set of verbs in a language may be viewed as a
script outlining the various modes in which objects denoted by the set
of nouns may interact.
Because verbs function as the script of a language, it is they which
lay out the basic plot of a discourse. Verbs prototypically fill the syntac­
tic/semantic function of the predicate of the clause, which denotes theADJECTIVES93nature of the state or event participated in by a set of objects referred
to by the nouns in the clause. Thus, the verb hit functioning in John hit
Peter tells us the manner in which John and Peter interacted. Verbs like
hit indicating a transaction between two or more objects are transitive.
Other verbs function as predicates denoting an event or state performed
or undergone by some object; these are intransitive verbs, and exam­
ples are run as in John ran in the race, or sleep as in John slept in the
barn.
The morphology of verbs will be treated in detail in Chapters 5 and
6, so I will only discuss some basic defining features here. The morpho­
logical feature most characteristic of verbs, and the only obligatory one,
is tense. All finite verbs must be inflected for tense, and non-finite verbs
must have a suffix -ru in the normal inflectional position for tense. No
other part of speech is ever inflected for tense, so it can be regarded as
a necessary and sufficient condition on the word class verb.
A second defining characteristic of verbs is that only they can occur
with the modal prefixes, such as ta- NEG, ant- POT and ka- LIKELY.
These are not necessary inflections on a verb, as most verbs are un­
marked for modality. But the potential occurrence of one of these pre­
fixes on a word always identifies it as a verb, for no other word class is
inflectable for modality.
A third morphological characteristic of verbs is the presence of pre­
fixes to indicate the person, number, and noun class of core nominal ar­
guments, i.e., subject, object, and indirect object. I have already pointed
out how nouns are uniquely assigned to noun classes and inflected for
number by suffixes, varying allomorphically according to noun class.
Verbs parallel this variation for noun class and number by indicating
these features for the nouns functioning as their core arguments, but do
so by means of prefixes. Examples of such verbal prefixes corresponding
to the noun suffixes were presented at the end of Section 3.2.
3.3 Adjectives
Adjectives are the word class that expresses a state, quality, or defining
characteristic of some object. As such, they most commonly function
syntactically as the modifier of some noun in a noun phrase. Some
languages seem to have no word class of adjectives at a.ll, assigning all
words denoting states or qualities of objects to the word classes verb or
noun (Dixon 1977). Other languages have a very small and restricted
class of adjectives. Yimas is one of these. There are only three true
unambiguous examples of adjectives in the language. They are kpa 'big',
yua 'good', and ma 'other'. These are distinguished from other Yimas
words denoting qualities of objects in that they are uninflected for the94WORO CLASSESverbal category tense and may occur with a following noun in a tightly
knit noun phrase (see Section 4.6).
(3-3) a. kpa nam
b. * nam kpa
house big
big house
'a big house'
No other word can occur between the adjective and the head noun. If this
should occur, the adjective must then be suffixed with a number class
suffix agreeing in these features with the modified noun. Its position is
now free and can occur on either side of the noun.
(3-4) a. kpa-nm
nam
big-house SG house
'a big house'
b. nam kpa-nm
house big-house SG
'a big house'
In fact, the inflected adjective need not even adjoin the noun, but may
occur anywhere in the clause.
(3-5) ama-na
nam
lSG-POSS house SG
ant-ka-na-war-kiant-nm
kpa-nm
POT-lSG A-DEF-build-NR FUT-house SG big-house SG
'Tomorrow I will be able to build my big house.'
Other words denoting qualities are morphologically verbs. These
occur with the suffix -k, the tense suffix for irrealis (IRR) . This suffix
is normally used to remove the action denoted by the verb from the
continuum in real time and thus mark it as timeless. It is therefore
used for events in the legendary past, unrealized events in the future
whose time of occurrence cannot be fixed, and states whose duration
cannot be bound (see Section 5.2. 1 . 1 ) . It is this last meaning which
accounts for its use with words denoting qualities. These adjectival-like
verbs suffixed with - k also require a number/class suffix, agreeing in
these features with a modified noun. As such they may occur on either
side of the noun, or may not even adjoin it. These tensed adjectival
verbs never occur in the construction characteristic of true adjectives,
i.e., immediately preceding the head noun in a close-knit noun phrase
without the number/ class suffixes. Examples of these adjectival verbs
follow:
(3-6) a. apak tukut-k-nmau
sister heavy-IRR-11 SG
'a fat sister'ADJECTIVES95b. urkpwica-k-n
numpran
black-IRR-III SG pig III SG
'a black pig'
*
c. urkpwica numpran
black
pig III SG
The adjectival verbs comprise the largest class of words denoting qual­
ities in Yimas. Besides the first stems already illustrated, we have the
following non-exhaustive list:
'white'
'long'
'short'
'hard/strong'

'new'

'whole'
'hollow'
'stubborn'
'empty, clear'
'dry'wapimuntaurmpwi­
ara!Jalca­
kamtakacJlaA further indication that these so-called adjectival verbs are really
verbs shows up in the formation of inchoatives, expressing changes of
state. The adjectival verbs can do this directly, by changing the tense
inflection to one within the real temporal continuum, and changing the
number/ class suffixes to the more typically verbal number/class prefixes
(S indicates the subject of an intransitive verb).
(3-7) a. na-t!Jknt-t
II SG S-become heavy-PERF
'She got fat.'
p-urkpwica-t
b. narm
skin VII SG VII SG S-blacken-PERF
' (My) skin darkened.'
The examples in (3-7) clearly indicate that these stems in their basic
meaning are process verbs; they only assume the stative meaning by
virtue by the IRR suffix -k, which stipulates that the event is unbounded
in time.
The true adjectives may not form inchoatives in this fashion. Rather
they must occur with the verb ti- 'do, become, feel', which carries the
tense suffix. The adjective may occur as a separate word or may be
incorporated into the verb, but in both cases it must co-occur with the
proper number/class suffix for the subject of the verb.

Another intriguing feature shared by Yimas, Karawari, Chambri, and
Angoram, as against Murik, concerns the order of the subject and object
pronominal affixes. In Murik the order is fixed: the object agreement
prefix precedes the subject prefix (Abbott 1978).
di-bi-takwat-ara
PL 0-3DL A-hit-3
'They two are hitting them.'
But in the other four languages, the order of the subject and object
suffixes varies. The conditioning factors for this variation are different
across the languages. For Yimas and Karawari, the causal factor is a
topicality hierarchy of first-person > second-person > third-person, with
the stipulation that the highest ranked prefix must occur closest to the
verb stem. These two languages typically have distinct prefix forms for
subject and object.","[46, 47]"

=6.5 Yimas Clause StructuresYimas clauses present a stark contrast to the highly structured and hier­
archically ordered pattern of its verbal morphology. Yimas clauses have
very little structure and certainly none that could be called hierarchical,
analogous to the levels of Vo , V 1 , V2 , and V in the verb. Yimas is an
excellent exemplar of a non-configurational language at the clausal level
(Chomsky 1981; Hale 1983): word order is free and clausal constituents
largely correspond to the word. Let me examine these claims in more
detail.
The only obligatory constituent of a clause in Yimas is a verb. In fact,
the great majority of clauses consist of just a verb. If other constituents
are present, they are arranged loosely around the verb, in no obligatory
order, although locationals and temporals tend to be located at the
clause periphery. Thus, in addition to examples like (6-184a,b) with
verb-final word order, the language also possesses the fully acceptable
variants in (6-184c,d).

A clause with both norninals following the verb (i.e., a verb-initial struc-370THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREture ) is perfectly grammatical, but is a bit more marked pragmatically
than the above examples.

kay
VIII SG 0-lSG A-push-SEQ-put down canoe VIII SGmarmp-n
river VII SG-OBL
'I pushed the canoe into the river.'
Examples ( 6-184a,b ) correspond to what may be called the unmarked
word order, i.e., with the verb last. A verb is associated in Yimas with a
falling intonation contour at its end, which in ( 6-184a,b) also functions
to mark the end of the clauses. This falling verbal intonation contour
also occurs in ( 6-184c,d) , but in these cases, another separate falling in­
tonation pattern occurs on the final constituents. This falling intonation
pattern is no more prominent on core arguments ( 6-184c ) than oblique
constituents ( 6-184d) . It may be that these final nominal constituents
correspond to a kind of afterthought phenomenon, as indicated by the
separate intonation contour, but these must not be equated with af­
terthought constructions in English. Yimas clauses like ( 6-184c,d) have
none of the marked pragmatic force of afterthought constructions in
English: postverbal constituents in Yimas are slightly more contrastive
than preverbal ones and thus ( 6-184c,d) are somewhat more marked
than ( 6-184a,b) , but this difference is nowhere near as emphatic as that
between John went to Berlin last weekend and He went to Berlin last
weekend, John did. It is also important to note that in examples like
( 6-184a,b ) , the core argument kay 'canoe' is already rather contrastive
in that it is encoded both as an independent noun and as a pronominal
i- VIII SG 0. The most neutral version of ( 6-184a) with no contrastive
reading at all on kay 'canoe' would lack the independent noun alto­
gether ( see Section 5.1.5 ) . It should be pointed out that afterthought
constructions with a core argument such as ( 6-184d) commonly code
the argument simultaneously with a pronominal affix. This suggests
that what is happening pragmatically in these cases is that the speaker
first codes the argument as an established referent with a pronominal
affix, but having done so, then decides that this coding is insufficient
either because there are multiple potential referents for that affix, or
because the referent is too far removed in the discourse, or because it
is simply not emphatic enough. He then repeats the full constituent
preverbally, producing an afterthought construction like ( 6-184d) . The
potential weakness in this argument is that afterthought constructions
with core arguments ( 6-184d ) are not more marked phonologically orYIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES371frequency-wise than those with oblique nominals (6-184c), for which no
verbal coding with a pronominal affix is available. This further suggests
that these afterthought constructions in Yimas are not highly marked
pragmatically, but represent weakly contrastive variants from the un­
marked versions.
The same comments apply to examples with more than one overt
core argument, as shown below:

'The man made a canoe.'
If one asks a Yimas speaker to translate 'the man made a canoe', one
is most likely to get (6-186a) as the equivalent (with (6-186b) a close
second). In this sense one could claim the word order of (6-186a), i.e.,
actor-object verb ( S OV), as the unmarked word order of Yimas. How­
ever, this claim is actually a chimera of elicitation, for in actual Yimas
discourse, examples like (6-186a) are quite rare. This is due largely to
the fact that clauses with two overt nominals functioning as core ar­
guments are very uncommon in Yimas, a highly marked structure; but
even when this does occur, it is by no means the case that a structure
like ( 6-186a) is statistically more frequent than ( 6-186b), or, for that
matter, (6-186c) or (6-186d). In this sense, the notion of unmarked
word order in Yimas corresponds more to an idealization of the linguist
than anything actually in the grammatical patterns of the speakers of
the language. Thus, both (6-186a) and (6-186b) can fairly be taken as
being roughly equivalent as to unmarked realizations of 'the man made
a canoe', with the proviso that both structures are in actuality highly
marked for having two overt nouns as core arguments.
Given the fact that the base structures (6-186a,b) are already quite
marked, it should come as no surprise that the afterthought construc­
tions (6-186c,d) are not much more so. In fact, constructions like
(6-184d), in which the noun functioning as the A participant of a transi­
tive occurs as an afterthought constituent, are probably the most com-372THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmon of all afterthought constructions, and statistically would be more
common in Yimas texts than constructions like ( 6-186a,b). Sentences
like (6-186d) occur commonly in texts when the actions jump back and
forth sequentially between two or more central A participants. Often
when the A participant changes, the speaker first encodes the new A
with an overt deictic or just a pronominal affix or both, but he then
decides that this marking was insufficient and thus additionally express
it as an afterthought noun. Example (6-186e), like (6-184) earlier, is the
most marked of these alternatives, because it is difficult to imagine a
context in which it would be appropriate, given the pragmatic force of
contrastiveness associated with afterthought nominals.
Yimas clauses are normally just a string of words. (Phrasal con­
stituents are relatively rare in Yimas and will be discussed below.) Other
than the verb, the words usually belong to the class of nominals and there
may be more of them than allowed by the valence of the verb, as in this
example:

kalakn na-n-kpuc-t
nam-n
boy I SG V SG 0-3SG A-chew-PERF house-OBL
'In the afternoon, the boy chewed my rotten betelnut in the
house.'
This verb contains a bivalent verb root kpuc- 'chew' which functions
formally as a transitive verb with two pronominal affixes, na- V SG 0
and n- 3SG A. Associated in the same clause are a temporal avkayapan
'afternoon' and five nominals, one oblique nam-n house-OBL 'in the
house' and the rest core, kalakn 'boy', patn 'betelnut', ama-na-kn 1SG­
POSS-V SG 'mine' and mama-k-n bad-IRR-V SG 'bad'. The four core
nominals must be linked to the two core argument slots of the verb for
this sentence to be grammatical (by the completeness constraint; see
Section 5.1.5).
A sentence like (6-187) is generated around the verb; all other con­
stituents are paratactically linked to it. The verb emerges from the
lexical and morphological derivational rules of the previous section fully
formed. It is a transitive verb, with two core arguments, one specified
as class V SG and the other as third person singular.
na - n -kpuc-t[sg] - [s�]-chew-[PERF]YIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES373The pronominal prefixes can now be linked to nominals with the same
specifications. The feature cluster
is easily matched to kalakn 'boy' which is third singular and, being ani­
mate, is the only possible noun that could be linked to the n- pronominal
prefix. The other prefix with the feature cluster[sg]has three possible nominals that may be linked to it: patn 'betelnut',
ama-na-kn 1SG-POSS-V SG 'mine', and mama-k-n bad-IRR-V SG 'bad'.
Because all of these are direct nominals, i.e., neither affixed with - n ""'
-nan OBL nor in a postpositional phrase, they must all be linked to this
one pronominal affix, or by the completeness constraint, the sentence
will be ungrammatical. This linkage is possible because all of them have
the same feature specifications as the pronominal prefix.
The nominals ama-na-kn 1SG-POSS-V SG 'mine' and mama-k-n bad­
IRR-V SG bear a similar kind of loose paratactic relationship to the
noun patn 'betelnut' (in this case, commonly termed apposition) that
patn 'betelnut' and kalakn 'child' bear to the pronominal prefixes. Fi­
nally, the oblique nominal nam-n house-OBL 'in the house', functioning
as a locational, and the temporal avkayapan 'afternoon' can be freely
added, for not being direct nominals, they need not be linked to the
verb. Such oblique and peripheral constituents modify the clause as a
whole. The structure of (6-187) can be diagrammatically represented as
shown below:

"Sago flour is cooked in two ways, either in flat, rather dry pancakes( tpuk) or in a porridge ( kalk) made by adding sago flour to boiling water
until it gels. A Yimas meal typically consists of sago ( tpuk) and a meat
( navkpuk) , usually fish, but occasionally other animals. Meats are oftenalso supplemented with various types of edible green plants gathered by
the women; the most common type is a fern of the lake shores ( namlan) .
One of the great delicacies in Yimas cuisine are sago grubs ( wun) which
are cultivated by felling and opening a sago palm which is allowed to
decay. A large black beetle lays its eggs in the tree, and these hatch into
the sago grubs. The tree is allowed to lie for a month or so until the
grubs become large and fat. They are then collected and eaten.
Yimas divide their year into two seasons, dry and wet, or dry water
(kavm) and high water ( arm kparm) . The dry season, which is at its
height around September, is a time of plentiful food. As the lakes dry
out due to lack of rain, the fish get trapped in the shrinking pools and
float to the surface for lack of oxygen. Further, as the forest dries out,
animals come closer to the lakes for water and are easier to hunt. This is
a time of gluttonous feasting on fish and hence is a good time for rituals
requiring feasts. The wet season, which runs from November through
May and peaks around February, is exactly the opposite. This is a time
of scarcity of food, although the Yimas with their rich lands never suffer
real hardship in this regard. With the lakes at a high level and the river
in flood, fish find many hiding places from the net, trap, and spear. PigsETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH13and other animals retreat deeper into the rain forest and, as much of the
low lying forest is flooded anyway, hunting is seriously disadvantaged.
There may be as much as a seven meter difference in water levels between
the dry and wet seasons.
As many anthropologists have noted, exchange and trade is a per­
vasive feature of the life of most New Guineans, and the Yimas are no
exception in this regard. Indeed, Yimas life is so structured by exchange
that people conceive of their relations to others primarily in terms of
exchange potential and responsibilities. All major rituals require an ex­
change of valuables. For example, when a villager dies, his relatives are
compensated by other villages with small payments of money; this is
regarded as part of the mourning ritual. Links with other villages are
almost exclusively structured in terms of exchange, and an important
trade network with Yimas as a pivotal link has existed for some time
in this area. As Gewertz (1983) has so clearly pointed out, a central
theme in Sepik societies is the asymmetrical exchange relationship be­
tween water and bush peoples. The bush peoples produce sago and trade
this with the water people for fish. As is typical throughout the world,
fish being a protein food is more prestigious, so that the exchange rate
favors the water people. As a water people, the Yimas enter into this
asymmetrical exchange relationship with the bush peoples speaking the
Arafundi and Alamblak languages to the east and west. These are long­
standing and important trade links, as demonstrated by the existence of
pidginized forms of Yimas which were used in these transactions (their
function has now been usurped by Tok Pisin).
These trading links persist today, but traditionally, Yimas was in­
volved in an even more extensive trading network. The flat, swampy
lands of the Yimas are especially valuable in that they produce strong
large strands of grass. These are collected, pounded flat, and woven
by the women into highly prestigious items throughout the middle and
lower Sepik: mosquito bags ( arv) (absolutely necessary in the mosquito
infested Sepik basin), various types of baskets, and sleeping mats ( irwa) .
In the past, men would fashion spears (ivkay) and bows (parmpan) and
arrows (piam) and would collect birds of paradise plumes ( warwarvkat)
from the nearby foothills to trade. These would be traded for clay pots
( yavi) , plates ( aprm), and hearths ( nuvkp) through the middlemen of
the middle Sepik, the Iatmul. This network has ceased to function since
World War II, but as far as I can reconstruct it from reports of older
villagers, it worked as follows. The Iatmul people of the villages at the
mouth of the Korosmeri and Karawari rivers, Mindimbit and Angriman,
��;rew tobacco and other goods and traded these with the people in the
Aibom village in Lake Chambri for the plates, pots, and hearths fash-14THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSioned there from the plentiful clay. The Iatmul then carried these to
Yimas to trade for the Yimas produced goods. My older informants
assure me that a special pidginized form of Iatmul was used in these
transactions. Although the pidgin is no longer known, this report is
consistent with Mead's (1935) claim of the widespread use of a jargon
Iatmul for intervillage trade in the middle Sepik. Further, both the
Yimas language and culture show unmistakable traces of importations
from Iatmul (Foley 1989).
Yimas, like Sepik societies generally, is strongly egalitarian in its so­
cial structure and ideology. There is no institutionalization of power and
authority, and the people are very resistant to any attempt to impose
someone else's will or decisions on them. The concept of advantageous
exchange remains the ideal even in interpersonal relationships. With
the lack of any institutionalized differences in status, social life is char­
acterized by incessant competition between individuals and clans, often
resulting in quarrels and even brawls. Individuals of both sexes are
proud, assertive, and demonstrative, but there are significant differences
in the social character of men and women which bear mentioning.
There is a strong sex-based differentiation of tasks in Yimas society,
and from a very early age boys and girls are separated. The life of
the women revolves around cooperative tasks such as fishing or making
sago thatch for roofing. Reflecting this, Yimas women tend to have a
practical, cooperative approach to life, and are interested primarily in
caring for their children. They lack the love of competitive display so
characteristic of the men, but exhibit a down-to-earth self-confidence.
It is important to note that Yimas women, in contrast to their sisters of
the highlands and western regions, are economically independent; they
produce the prestigious trade goods like fish and woven objects, and
they hold the rewards of this production.
In contrast, Yimas men are boastful, individually competitive, and
prone to aggression. They jealously guard their prerogatives and con­
stantly gossip, attempting to run down the reputation of rivals. Any per­
ceived status gain or economic reward is likely to be a cause of a quarrel
or worse. Yimas men find it virtually impossible to engage in large-scale
cooperative activities. What cooperation there is among them is gen­
erally the activity of close kin. If it were not for the activities of the
women, Yimas society would probably be subject to constant fissions,
as Bateson (1936) claims the Iatmal are, or would end up like the picture
of Mundugumor society that Mead (1935) draws.
Traditionally, the life of Yimas men, like so many Sepik societies,
revolved around the male cult house or house tambaran ( manm ) . These
houses were destroyed during World War II and never rebuilt, with theETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH15result that all the important ritual life associated with these ceased be­
fore 1950. It is quite likely that the activities of the male cult house
provided a powerful integrating force in the life of the men, counter­
balancing the divisive effects of their competitive strivings, as appears
elsewhere in the Sepik (Tuzin 1974), and their disappearance might have
left a serious cultural vacuum. The male cult houses were the places
where the initiated men of the village spent most of their time, gossip­
ing, chewing betelnut, and doing small odd jobs. They were closed to
women and uninitiated boys under pain of death. Men typically slept
in their clan's cult house, not with their wives or children, who slept
together in the large family houses. Young boys were initiated into the
life of the male cult house in early puberty. They were secluded in the
cult house for several months and only allowed to go outside to bathe
in the dead of night so that they would not be seen by the women.
Within the cult house they were plastered with mud, beaten regularly
and only given the foulest of food to eat, which they were forbidden to
touch, being fed by their mother's brothers. In the final act of initiation,
their backs were cut transversely with sharp rocks, leaving permanent
scars.
All traditional Yimas religious life centered on the male cult house
(they are now baptized Roman Catholics, but many of the traditional
beliefs in spirits still persist). The male cult house held carvings and bark
paintings depicting the spirits of totemic ancestors, as well as fetishes,
such as stones that housed spirits. Religious rituals entailed making
entreaties to these spirits of totemic ancestors to provide benefits for
the living. Most of these rituals required the playing of paired bamboo
flutes (tavkut) , which were said to be the voices of the spirits. These
were kept in the cult house and hidden from women. Rituals would
typically go on all night or even for several nights in a row. Elaborate
rituals would precede all important male activities, such as raiding a
neighboring village. The Yimas were both headhunters and cannibals,
the former playing an especially important role in the culture of the
village. For example, only boys who had killed in a headhunting raid
were permitted to wear a pubic covering of a flying fox skin and hence
be eligible to take a wife. During the frenzied, all-night rituals which
preceded a headhunting raid, a man would often fall into trance, taken
by other men to be possession by a totemic spirit. He would then be
interviewed as to the prospects and proper procedures for a successful
raid. The most popular targets for Yimas raids were the Arafundi vil­
lages of Imanmeri and Wambramas-Yamandim and the Alamblak village
of Chimbut. Their only ally was the Arafundi speaking Auwim village.
Yimas society is built up out of kinship ties. In fact, unlike our16THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSwestern society, there are no other institutionalized social ties. The
largest kinship groups in the village are the patrilineal clans, each with
its own totemic ancestor(s) and totemic animal. For example, my main
informant's clan has the central totemic ancestor Kikay and the totem
the hornbill (kaykut) . Each clan is divided into two or more lineages.
Every member of the clan is given at birth a personal name drawn from
the names of the totemic ancestors of the clan. There are no specific
names for the clans in Yimas; rather, each takes its name from that
area of the village where its male cult house stood. There is also no
generic word for 'clan', the word anti 'land' being used instead. So to
say 'we are of the same clan', one would actually say 'we are of one land'.
The clans are the unit of marriage within the village. The Yimas are
largely endogamous (marrying inside the village), and marriage is across
clans. Tradition has long prescribed which clans are linked together in
marriage arrangements, and from a very early age, children are aware
as to who are permissible spouses within this schema. Within recent
years this has weakened somewhat, with couples occasionally marrying
according to personal choice, against the traditional arrangements. This
is frowned on by older villagers, but they shrug their shoulders and say
'this is another time'. There are also some traces of what may have
been a dual organization of the clans into two moieties. This seems to
have been involved in the initiation of boys in the male cult house and
other rituals associated with this, but as these had completely ceased
for over 25 years before I went to Yimas for the first time, it has proved
impossible to verify this.
The Yimas kinship system, like that of many Sepik societies, is a
Crow-Omaha variant (or, to be more precise, an Omaha system given
the patrilineal bias). Crow-Omaha systems are those which exhibit a
confl.ation of generations along the main line of descent. In Yimas, this
occurs because the paternal grandfather (father's father) is classified as
older brother (kpan) i.e., of the same generation as ego instead of two
generations above. This also has the peculiar effect of placing one's
own father in the class of one's son, because his father is one's older
brother (sons of a group of brothers are sons of each). Thus, one's
father is simultaneously one's son and one's son is simultaneously one's
father. I have often witnessed the event of a father addressing his five
year old son as api 'father' because of this generational collapsing. This
tallies well with Bateson's ( 1936, 38-41) point about the identification
of father and son in Iatmul society (also having a Crow-Omaha variant
for kinship terminology), but as far as I know, Yimas is the only culture
in which this identification finds articulation in the kinship terminology.
In the maternal clan, one's most important relation is mother's brotherETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH17( away). He is always ready to provide support and take one's side in an
argument. Whereas there is some tension in the father/son relationship,
there is none in this maternal uncle/nephew kin link.
Yimas recorded history only stretches back about 50 years. Prior to
that, we must rely on oral history in the form of myths and legends (a
small amount of archeological work was very recently done at Yimas, but
no results are available just yet) . The Yimas legends indicate that it is
largely an immigrant village (see Harrison 1989 for a similar claim about
the prehistory of Manambu-speaking villages of the Sepik river). The
ancestors of the various clans came to Yimas from different areas: from
the Sepik river near the mouth of the Korosmeri-Karawari, from the
extensive swamps of the Blackwater river, a tributary of the Korosmeri,
from the foothills beyond the large southern group of Yimas lakes, and
from the mountainous country which forms the source for the Arafundi
river. The last group called their homeland Manki and today say that
it was also the homeland of the Chambri and Murik peoples. The myth
relates that after a quarrel with their menfolk over food, the women of
Manki drifted in a hollow log down the Arafundi river. At the junction
of the Arafundi and Karawari rivers, the log got tied up in some debris.
The women went ashore and climbed up the hill there and saw the
mountain behind the present Chambri village. Some determined to go
there. They reboarded their log and floated down the Karawari river
until it joins the Sepik. Here some of the women separated and went
to Lake Chambri, where they perfected the art of pottery making. The
rest remained on the log and floated down the Sepik to its mouth where
they married the men there. This legend is especially interesting in that
it provides a historical account for the clear genetic relationship between
the Yimas, Chambri and Murik languages.
The Yimas also have legends concerning a flooding of the site of the
village and the creation of land out of endless expanse of water, both of
which correlate quite closely with recent speculations on the prehistory
of the Sepik area (Swadling 1984) . Other legends give explanations for
natural phenomena, such as why flying foxes sleep hanging upside down
in trees, or for cultural themes, like the origin of bamboo flutes. Many
of the legends related by men show a deep distrust and fear of the power
of women, a not unusual theme in New Guinea.
Yimas contact with the western world only came in the 1930s, and
then it was only marginal. Their major induction into the modern world
was the Japanese invasion of northern New Guinea in World War II. This
was a very traumatic period for the Yimas, as the Japanese stationed a
small garrison in the village and irrevocably disrupted much of their life
and culture. The male cult houses were destroyed, and all their associ-18THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSated rituals abandoned. The entire village was burned during a bombing
raid. The massive technological superiority of the western world left a
deep impression on the Yimas, and following the war they determined
to follow European practices with a view to acquiring European made
goods. They moved down from the original village site on the hill above
the river (a good defensive position) and built their houses along the
river, hoping to attract European interests. They abandoned their tra­
ditional religion of the male cult house, converted to Roman Catholicism
and built a church. Yimas children of both sexes have gone to school
since the mid-1960s. But western type development and western-made
goods have been slow in coming. The only source of work in the area is
a tourist lodge which employs about a half dozen Yimas. In spite of the
appearance of goods like outboard motors and cassette players, Yimas
life still largely revolves around subsistence hunting and gathering. For
most Yimas, daily life is pretty much as it was 50 years ago, although a
little easier. The major casualty of western contact has been their ritual
and spiritual life. (Virtually no traditional legends are known by anyone
under 30.) The young have no interest in them, preferring electrified
music from Port Moresby and New York.
1.4 Sepik Area Languages in General and the Lower Sepik
Family in Particular
Excluding the languages of the upper Sepik and the Torrecelli mountains
which are very diverse, but are beyond the purview of this study, the
languages of the Sepik-Ramu basin number about 80 in over a dozen lan­
guage families. In spite of such great genetic diversity, the languages of
many different families often share a number of structural traits. This
diffusion is a linguistic reflection of the pronounced consciousness of
trade and exchange discussed in the previous section. Because of trade
and other cultural links, a village's language is subject to strong influ­
ences from the outside. Further, shared linguistic allegiance is insuffi­
cient as a basis for intercommunity solidarity. The Karawari language
is spoken by around 1 ,500 people in ten villages. Dialect differentiation
is not great, but there is little feeling of a larger community composed
of the villages speaking Karawari. Some Karawari villages have closer
cultural links to villages speaking other languages such as Iatmul or An­
goram, than to those speaking Karawari. Iatmul villages provide another
example; they often raided and headhunted in other Iatmul villages, the
shared language being no hindrance in this regard. Clearly, in the Sepik
region, shared linguistic allegiance is not a rallying point for cultural
cohesion.
Given this situation, it is not surprising that frequent shifting of lan-8EPIK AREA LANGUAGES AND THE LOWER 8EPIK FAMILY19guage boundaries is common in this area of New Guinea. Like other
cultural artifacts, language is a trade item. Villages on the border be­
tween two language groups may shift their linguistic allegiance if their
shifting cultural and economic links would seem to warrant this. Some
border villages may be so precariously balanced linguistically that it is
difficult to determine their affiliation. Some individuals and families are
bilingual; others speak only one of the two languages. Mead ( 1938, 159)
mentions the case of Ulup village on the border between the Arapesh
and Abelam languages. These two languages are structurally very dif­
ferent and belong to different language families. Neither the Arapesh,
nor the Abelam, nor the inhabitants of the village themselves were sure
of Ulup's affiliations. In a shifting situation like this the final result may
be that small language groups are gradually assimilated and disappear
entirely. (See Foley 1989 for further discussion of the points of this and
the previous paragraph.)
Given a sociolinguistic situation like this, it comes as no surprise that
genetically unrelated languages over a wide area often display remark­
ably uniform structural features. Phonologically, for example, nearly all
languages of the area are characterized for a short high to mid-central
vowel, non-phonemic and epenthetically introduced to separate imper­
missible consonant clusters. A common consonantal pattern is to have
stops in four places of articulation (labial, dental, palatal, and velar) ,
with a corresponding nasal i n each position. This is attested, for exam­
ple, in such widely geographically separated languages as Yimas, Abelam
(Maprik area), and Mikarew (Ramu river). Prenasalized stops are com­
mon, but are sometimes best analyzed as clusters consisting of a stop
preceded by a homorganic nasal. Unlike other areas of New Guinea, a
phonemic contrast between two liquids, /r/ and /1/, is not uncommon.
Suprasegmental phenomena are limited to stress; languages with phone­
mic tone are unattested, in contrast to their common occurrence in the
central highlands.
With the notable exception of the Lower Sepik family and a few
others, languages of the Sepik-Ramu region are morphologically rather
Himple. What affixation there is is largely suffixal, but again, the Lower
Sepik family is an exception. All languages make a sharp distinction
between noun and verb. Nouns are simpler morphologically than verbs;
in some languages the only common nominal inflections are suffixes to
mark oblique cases, as in Iatmul (Staalsen 1972) ( Vk<Jy-mpa house-LOC
'in the house'). Languages of the lower Sepik and Ramu rivers area
commonly have complex, highly irregular plural formations. Compare
these forms from Miyak (Yuat river) , Angoram (lower Sepik river) and
Kaian (Ramu river; Z'graggen 1971 ) :THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS20

the overall plural-marking system of the three languages is quite similar
and clearly an areal feature.
Another areal feature of the region concerns the possessive mor­
pheme. In all languages this is a suffix or postposition and occurs in
one of two forms: -kV or - nV. Unrelated, geographically widely sepa­
rated languages will often show agreement in the morpheme form chosen
for this function. For example, Miyak (Yuat river) and Tangu (Ramu
river; Z'graggen 1971) both employ -kV (M: va-k'J ken 1SG-POSS dog
'my dog', T: ku-ka riei 1SG-POSS dog 'my dog'), while Yimas, like all
Lower Sepik languages, and Kaian (Z'graggen 1971) both use -nV (Y:
ama-na mamay 1SG-POSS brother 'my brother', K: lA-na yakay 1SG­
POSS brother 'my brother'). While the possessor precedes the possessed
in these cases (and this is the usual pattern) , it is not always so (Emerum
(upper Ramu river: Z'graggen 1971): isam ya-ka brother 1SG-POSS 'my
brother'). Proto-Ndu and most of the languages of this family have an
interesting variant on this theme; they use - nV if the possessor is first­
or second-person and -kV if it is third-person.
Verbal morphology of Sepik region languages is on the whole rather
simple. In many languages the only affixation is suffixation for tense/as­
pect/mood (Yessan-Mayo (middle Sepik; cf. Foreman 1974): yi-we go­
NR PAST 'went', Miyak (Yuat river): som-b-a cook-PRES-INDIC 'cook­
ing', Bosman (between the Sepik and Ramu rivers; cf. Capell 1951):
vas-et see-PAST 'saw', Abelam (Maprik area; cf. Wilson 1980): k-'Jk eat­
PAST 'ate') . In addition to tense/aspect/mood suffixes, a minority of
languages have subject agreement suffixes, cross-referencing the person
and number of the subject of transitive and intransitive verbs (Iatmul
(Staalsen 1972) : yi-b-win go-PRES-1SG 'I am going') . More complex
verbal morphology than this in the area is rare, although quite commonSEPIK AREA LANGUAGES AND THE LOWER SEPIK FAMILY21elsewhere in New Guinea. Only the languages of the Lower Sepik family
and some contiguous languages in the region ( Gapun, Alamblak, and
Arafundi) have both subject and object agreement. The relevant af­
fixes are prefixes in Lower Sepik languages (Yimas: pu-ka-tay-pcut 3PL
0-1SG A-see-RM PAST 'I saw them') but suffixes in Alamblak (Bruce
1984) (fayk-r-m get-3SG M A-3PL 0 'he got them') and Arafundi (yep7)gi-na-cik see-3PL O-FUT-1SG A 'I will see them') .
All Papuan languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have typological
characteristics of verb final languages. Many, perhaps most, of these
have rather rigid subject/object/verb word order.

Note that the Bosman and Miyak examples show case-marking on the

cropping up here and there, although many are like Iatmul and Yimas
in lacking case suffixes. One fairly common feature of Sepik languages
is the use of the dative case suffix to mark animate, particularly human,
direct objects.

Sepik languages with rather richer morphology, including nominal gen­
der or noun classes and subject and object agreement, are not so rigid.
Yimas, for example, is extremely free in its word order, as seems to be
true of thP: other Lower Sepik languages.(1-5) a. Yessan-Mayo:

Any permutation o f these three words in Yimas produces a grammat­
ical sentence. Alamblak tends to have the verb last, although oblique
constituents commonly follow it, with subject and object preceding the
verb, but in either order (Bruce 1984) .

All Sepik area languages attested make use of dependent medial verb
forms, but in almost all these are restricted to the case in which the
subjects of the linked clauses are the same (but see Section 7.3.1 for a
discussion of the complications in this regard in Yimas) . Consider these
examples of clauses linked with dependent medial verb forms:

When compared to the general picture of the linguistic scene of the
Sepik-Ramu region just sketched, the languages of the Lower Sepik fam­
ily emerge as a great anomaly in many grammatical respects. Phonolog­
ically they fit quite well, but morphologically they are very divergent.
Lower Sepik languages are highly elaborated morphologically, and most
are just as heavily prefixing as suffixing, if not more so. They tend to
have quite free word order at the clausal level and a weak development
of dependent verb forms.
The languages of the Lower Sepik family are relatively closely re­
lated, roughly on the order of the Germanic family. There are six mem­
ber languages in the family: Yimas (250 speakers) , Karawari ( 1,500
speakers), Angoram (7,000 speakers) , Chambri (1 ,200 speakers) , Murik
( 1,500 speakers) and Kopar (250 speakers) . Map 2 gives the relative
positions of these languages. Murik and Kopar are very closely related,
almost dialects of the same language, so I will treat them as one for the
purposes here. The 25 cognate sets in Table 1 demonstrate this close
relationship of the languages. (K after a form indicates that it is Kopar,
not Murik) . In Foley (1986, 215-20) , I attempted a careful, somewhat
detailed, reconstruction of the phonology of the protolanguage; I will
simply summarize the results here. Proto-Lower Sepik had a phonemic
system of consonants like the following:
*p
(* b)
*mp
* mb
*m
*w*t
*d
* nt
* nd
*s
*n
*r
*y*k
( * g)
* :uk
*:g g
*:uThis system is rather tentative; only Chambri preserves the distinction
hdween the voiceless and voiced prenasalized stops, the other languages
uwrging them. Further, the plain voiced series is established on the basis
of a single sound correspondence establishing *d in one cognate set. If020

The Yimas language is found in the Sepik river basin area of Papua New
Guinea. It is spoken in two villages along the lower reaches of the Ara­
fundi river, a tributary of the Karawari river, which in turn is a tributary
of the main Sepik river, the great pulsing cultural artery of this region
of New Guinea. Map 1 depicts the linguistic situation in this general
area. Yimas is the southernmost language of the Lower Sepik family, so
that most of the surrounding languages are genetically unrelated to it.
Only directly to the north is a related language, Karawari.
Karawari and Yimas are rather closely related, on the order of Dutch
and German, and form a subgroup within the Lower Sepik family. The
family as a whole will be discussed in some detail in Section 1.4, so only
a few points of close similarity between the two languages will be noted.
Phonologically the two languages are very close, except that Karawari
lacks the palatal lateral, having /r/ as its only liquid. Thus, Yimas /lY/
corresponds to /ri/ in Karawari (Y: palYapa, K: pariapa 'front porch').
Other correspondences are Yimas /r, t/ to Karawari /s/ (Y: triv, K:
sisiv 'tooth'); word initially, Yimas /n/ to Karawari /y/ (Y: nam, K:
yam 'house'); and Yimas /TJ/ for Karawari 0 (Y: varwa, K: arwo 'pe­
nis') . Finally, in the environment of the low vowel /a/ , Yimas /r, t/
correspond to Karawari /y/ (Y: patn, K: payn 'betelnut'; Y: numpran,
K: yimbyan 'pig') .
Morphologically, the two languages are quite similar, but generally
Karawari exhibits a greater simplicity than Yimas. Both languages
have inherited the complex noun class system of Proto-Lower Sepik,
but whereas Yimas has preserved a three-way contrast in number (sin­
gular, dual, and plural) in all classes, Karawari has merged the dual with
the plural in half of its classes, resulting in a simple singular/plural con­
trast for these. Verbs in Karawari are also less elaborate than in Yimas.
Karawari has fewer tense distinctions than Yimas (which has eight), and
also lacks the paucal number suffix of Yimas. Still, the languages are
remarkably similar, even to fine points of detail. For example, instead
of the expected prefix sequence ma-ka for a first-person singular subject
and a second-person singular object, both languages have a suppletive
form kampan-.
To the east of Yimas, along the upper reaches of the Arafundi river,
and in the mountains which constitute its source, lie the villages speak­
ing the Arafundi language. This is spoken by around a thousand people
in ten villages. Dialect differentiation within the Arafundi language is
significant. Until very recently, it was thought to be a language isolate,
but it now seems fairly likely that it is genetically related to the Harwai,
Hagahai and Pinai languages spoken in the mountains further to the8THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSeast in the head waters of the Yuat river. Although there has been some
borrowing of words from Yimas because of long-standing trading contact
(even basic vocabulary like Yimas apwi 'father' into the Wambramas­
Yamandim dialect of Arafundi), Yimas and Arafundi are clearly not
genetically related and are contrastive on all levels. In contrast to the
two-height vowel system of Yimas, Arafundi distinguishes three vowel
heights and adds a length distinction ( yampa 'his fire', ya·mpa 'door'.
The palatal consonants of Yimas seem to be a relatively recent addition
and most are derived by a productive phonological rule of palataliza­
tion (see rule (2-3) in Chapter 2). This claim is buttressed by their
restricted distribution: they cannot occur at the ends of words. Palatals
in Arafundi are strongly established in the phonological system; there
are even two series, !amino-palatals and palatalized velars. The palatals
are basic, underived consonants and occur in most positions of the word,
including finally (nip 'you (DL)').
Morphologically, Arafundi is much simpler than Yimas. Nouns are
not inflected for gender, noun class or number. There is an optional
nominative case marker for nouns, -n, and an accusative case marker
for pronouns, -i. The only other feature for which a noun may be
inflected is its possessor (kot-k hand/foot-1SG POSS 'my hand/foot').
Yimas, like Lower Sepik languages generally, lacks this possibility. All
person/number suffixes in Arafundi fail to distinguish between second­
and third-person in the non-singular numbers. Arafundi verbs are also
much simpler than those of Yimas: there are no prefixes at all (prefixes
being diagnostic of Lower-Sepik family languages), and suffixes are used
for tense and to indicate subject and object (pok-nanci-na-cik hit-2SG
O-FUT-1SG A 'I will hit you'). (A marks the subject of a transitive verb
and 0, its object. I will also employ the abbreviation S for the subject of
an intransitive verb. These are Dixon's (1979) suggestions.) The subject
suffixes are also portmanteau, representing basic tense/aspect/mood dis­
tinctions, a common feature of the languages of the neighboring central
highlands ( ow-k wash-1SG S PERF 'I washed' versus ow-v wash-1SG S
IRR 'let me wash' versus ow-p-cik wash-PROG-1SG S IMPERF 'I am
washing'). This never occurs in Lower Sepik languages. Finally, most
dialects of Arafundi have the typical clause-chaining structures of cen­
tral highlands languages, involving morphologically distinct dependent
verb forms, and make extensive use of switch-reference morphology, as
in this example from the Auwim dialect.

The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the contrast in syntactic
behavior between (4-60a) and (4-60b) is that (4-60a), without posses­
sive agreement, is a noun phrase, but (4-60b), with it, is not. The latter
construction is a scrambled paratactic construction, with the two nom­
inals in apposition to each other (as we will argue below). In addition
to these structural differences there is a semantic difference between
the (a) and (b) constructions, as demonstrated by the choice of nouns
in (4-60a) and (4-60b). The unaffixed (a) construction is largely re­
stricted to possessed kin terms. These are the only possessed nouns
for which it is commonly heard spontaneously and indeed is highly fa­
vored for them. The (a) construction with other types of nouns, while
grammatical, is only marginally so and is rarely encountered. The (b)
construction with the p�ssessive agreement suffix is much preferred with
non-kin nouns. It could be argued that this difference reflects a distinc­
tion between alienable and inalienable possession, but, since classically
inalienably possessed nouns such as body parts occur in the (b) con­
struction (as well as the possessor raising construction with verbs, see
Section 6.2.3.2), this claim does not seem entirely warranted. The (a)
construction seems reserved for kin terms only.
The (a) construction, i.e., the noun phrase structure, is restricted to
possessor-possessed phrases and true adjective plus noun constructions.
Phrases composed of kpa 'big', yua 'good', and ma 'other' have the same
restrictions as possessors lacking agreement.

Unlike possessive-possessed phrases, there is no semantic restriction for
true adjectives concerning the type of noun which can occur in either
the tightly knit noun phrase or the scrambled pattern. Common nouns
like patn 'betelnut' occur freely in both structures. Adjectival verbs
which require in all contexts the adjectival agreement suffixes are only
encountered in the scrambled pattern. The tightly knit noun phrase
structure is ungrammatical for them.

The two stems, mama 'bad' and waca 'small', which are simultaneously
members of the class of true adjectives and adjectival verbs, are espe­
('ially interesting. When they have the morphological properties of true
adjectives, they only occur in the tight noun phrase structure; with
t.he morphological properties of adjectival verbs, they are found in the
scrambled patterns.

As such, it can occur in any position and be freely separated from the
noun it modifies by other words.
We may summarize the behavior of these two constructions in the fol­
lowing table (where AGR indicates any adjectival/possessive agreement
suffix):

The constructions in the first column are clear examples of noun
phrases and should be generated explicitly by phrase structure rules.
An important generalization about noun phrases in Yimas is that they
may consist of only two constituents, a modifier and a head, in that
order. If more than two modifiers are present for a given noun, one
must take an agreement suffix and occur in the scrambled pattern.

A noun phrase with a head noun composed of conjoined nouns, as in
( 4-75a), is ungrammatical. One uses either a conjoined construction of
two noun phrases, each consisting of an adjective plus a head noun, as
in ( 4-75b ), or a scrambled structure in which the adjective occurs with
an agreement suffix and has no restrictions as to its position, as in ( 475c,d). Note that the gender resolution in (4-75d,e) is to the masculine
dass I with the agreement suffix - mampan I DL. Using the corresponding
fmnale suffix - nput II DL, as in (4-75e) results in ungrammaticality. ThisNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES186illustrates the general gender/class resolution rule always neutralizes to

Clearly, the phrase structure rules needed to generate Yimas noun
phrases must produce structures of no more than two constituents, the
rightmost of which must be a noun, not another noun phrase, in order
to block structures like (4-75a). In other words, unlike English noun
phrases, those ofYimas are non-recursive, and the phrase structure rules
must reflect this. The following is suggested:
(4-76) NP
(M) + N
ADJ }
M
{ POSSR
N, of course, covers simple nouns like patn 'betelnut' as well as noun
compounds like numn karm 'native language'. ADJ covers all mem­
bers of the class of true adjectives, i.e., those which may occur without
agreement suffixes. POSSR consists of a noun or pronoun plus na POSS.
There is a selectional restriction concerning noun phrases with POSSR
to the effect that they are highly preferred when N is a noun, and disfa­
vored (but grammatical) elsewhere. The constituent preceding na POSS
in the POSSR slot is either a noun or a pronoun. As these are nominals,
it could be the case that a noun phrase precedes na and this would be
potential source for recursion. This possibility is more theoretical than
actual, however, for the language has general ways to avoid such possi­
bilities. For example, if we wanted to say 'my mother's brother's child'
with recursive in the POSSR constituent, one might expect the following:
(4-77) ?ama-na uayuk
na matn
na
lSG-POSS mother II SG POSS brother I SG POSS
kalakn
child I SG
'my mother's brother's child'
This is a possible structure but would, in fact, very rarely if ever be
uttered. There is a perfectly good kin term for 'mother's brother's child',
akay, just like 'cousin' in English, which would be used instead.
( 4-78) ama-na akay
lSG-POSS mother's brother's child
'my mother's brother's child'
Since the overwhelming use of possessives in noun phrases is with kin
terms, this effectively almost excludes recursion in the POSSR slot. But
even in cases with non-kin terms recursion may be avoided. Consider,
for example, the following phrase:
-->--tNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES187na kay
(4-79) ama-na matn
lSG-POSS brother-! SG POSS canoe VIII SG
'my brother's canoe'
This contains a recursive POSSR slot and is grammatical. But an al­
ternative, and preferred, way to express ( 4-79) is to treat the complex
POSSR constituent as a single noun phrase and attach the possessive
agreement suffix for kay 'canoe' to it, thus generating a scrambled struc­
ture overall.
( 4-80) kay
na-y
[ama-na matn]
canoe VIII SG lSG-POSS brother I SG POSS-VIII SG

It is important to note that noun phrases generated by the rules in
( 4-76) typically inflect as if they were single nouns. We have already
seen that noun class and number are obligatory inflections for nouns;
they cannot be carried solely by adjoining modifiers.
( 4-81) a. m-!Jkl

( 4-82) a. mu-m
payum
NR DIST-1 PL man I PL
'those men'
b. m-um
*panmal
NR DIST-1 PL man
The (b) examples are ungrammatical because the nouns appear in their
base forms (equivalent to the singular), but are modified by non-singular
pronouns. This is impossible. Nouns which are non-singular must be
inflected as such, e.g., in the (a) examples, number and noun class in­
flection may not be carried by adjoining modifiers. As the (a) examples
further demonstrate, the modifiers themselves must be inflected for the
same features of noun class and number.
But this is not the case with modifiers in noun phrases. In these
constructions, the adjective or possessor remains completely uninflected
for noun class and number (if they are so inflected the scrambled pattern
n�sults), and the head noun is the sole carrier of these features. In other
words, the noun phrase is assigned the features of noun class and number
a whole.

The claim that grammatical features are assigned to the noun phrase
as a whole is further borne out by the behavior of the oblique suffix. It
follows the head noun, but has scope over the whole noun phrase.
(4-84) a. [rna ka]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
b.*ma-nan ka-Jlan
other-OBL canoe VIII SG-OBL
(4-84b) shows that the modifier in a noun phrase cannot be affixed with
the oblique suffix even if its head noun already is indicating that the
domain of the oblique suffix is the whole noun phrase not just the head
noun.
The modifiers which freely form noun phrases are possessors and
true adjectives, but there are sporadic instances of other word types
occurring in noun phrases without their normal adjectival/possessive
agreement suffixes. An interesting example is the following:
(4-85) [[mpa ant]-Jlan
namat]
aypak
one ground VIII SG-OBL person I PL COP I PL
'We are one clan.' ('people of one ground')
The numeral mpa 'one' almost always takes adjectival agreement suf­
fixes, but here it occurs as modifier of a noun phrase which is the first
constituent of a compound. If mpa 'one' were to take an agreement suf­
fix in the above example, it would no longer form a noun phrase with
the following noun. Because nouns and noun phrases are the only pos­
sible first constituents in this compound it would then be ill formed.
Consequently, an agreement suffix for mpa is blocked in this case.
The scrambled structures have very different properties from the
tight noun phrases. They are not single noun phrases at all, but rather
two noun phrases in apposition, one consisting of a noun, the other a
modifier, nominalized by the agreement suffix. They are joined together
as a single semantic unit (but two syntactic units) by the agreement
suffix, for it is this marker on the modifier which links it to the noun
being qualified. In no sense, though, is this noun the head of the modi­
fier; they are only joined at the level of semantic interpretation to formNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES189a conceptual unit. Rather, there is evidence to suggest that the actual
head of the modifier is the agreement suffix itself.

The (a) examples are typical noun phrases, while (b) and (c) are
scrambled structures, with and without an overt deictic, respectively.
The (d) examples are the ones relevant here. They demonstrate that
a deictic cannot serve as the head of a noun phrase. Note the close
parallelism between the (b) and (d) examples. The agreement suffix in
(b) corresponds to the deictic in (d). This suggests that the agreement
suffix could be analyzed as the realization of the deictic, as follows:
( 4-88) [[yua]
m-ra]
good NR DIST-VII PL\ I[[yua] -ra]
In other words, modifiers affixed with the adjectival/possessive agree­
ment suffixes are noun phrases in miniature, with the agreement suffix
functioning as the head. A noun and a modifier affixed with an agree­
uwnt tmffix are simply noun phrases in apposition to each other. There190NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESis no strong syntactic relationship between them, merely a loose parat­
actic link, established by the coreference in noun class and number. This
accounts for the completely unconstrained permutations of word order
observed between a noun and a modifier with an agreement suffix. So
the structural relationships in a sentence like ( 4-86b) are as shown below:
[[yua-]ra]
[ya-n-ampa-wat]
(4-89) [imprampat]
basket VII PL good-VII PL VII PL 0-3SG A-weave-HAB
'She weaves good baskets.'
or more literally:
'She weaves baskets, good ones. '
There is no closer syntactic relationship in ( 4-89) between imprampat
'baskets' and yua-ra 'good' than there is between imprampat and the
verb. The linking between them is done at the semantic level; they
are interpreted as denoting the same real world objects because of the
coreference in the noun class and number specifications.
Further evidence that modifiers with agreement suffixes are noun
phrases in miniature is demonstrated by their behavior with the oblique
suffix, even when there is no overt noun in the clause.
( 4-90) [[[ma]-m]-un]
na-wapal
other-IV SG-OBL 3SG S-climb
'She climbed on another (sago palm) .'
The understood noun is tnum 'sago palm', indicated only by the class
IV singular adjectival suffix - (u)m. The claim is that the stem ma-m
other-IV SG is a noun phrase and, as expected, it may be affixed with
the oblique suffix.
A more interesting example is given below:
( 4-91) [anti]
[kanta] [[[[waca-k]-i]-Jlan]
ground VIII SG but
small-IRR-VIII SG-OBL
[kapa-taw-wat]]
lDL S-sit-HAB
'But we two live on a little land.'
As mentioned in Section 3.9, Yimas conjunctions like kanta 'but' have a
strong tendency to occur in the second position of the clause, as in this
example; but here it intervenes between a noun and an adjectival verb
modifier. The adjectival verb is nominalized and functions as a noun
phrase because of the suffix - i VIII SG (triggering the palatalization rule
(2-3) for the following /n/ ) . It is clear that it modifies anti 'ground'
because of their agreement in noun class and number features. The really
interesting detail is the position of the oblique suffix. While anti 'ground'
is obviously under the scope of the oblique suffix, it is only indirectlyNOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES191linked to it, by having the same noun class and number specifications
as the noun phrase waca-k-i small-IRR-VIII SG, which is in turn affixed
by the oblique suffix. Note that the oblique suffix is here attached to
what would seem at first view to be a modifier rather than the head, but
given the claim that such modifiers are in fact noun phrases themselves,
the construction is quite straightforward.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"

"384INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSThe verb in (7-20a) lacks any valence decreasing affix so, being a bivalent
verb, it must be associated with two core arguments, an A n- 3SG A and
an 0 na- 3SG 0. The contrastive pronoun panawt 'self' must be linked
to the A participant above, deriving the meaning 'he killed him himself'.
The verb in the reflexive example (7-2b), while semantically bivalent, is
formally intransitive. Further, pan- is marked with the oblique suffix so
may not function as a core argument. Thus, the single core argument
m-n 'he' is an S acting on himself, and hence the reflexive reading of the
construction.
As can be gleaned from the preceding examples, these contrastive
pronouns only mark gender and number. Person must be expressed
through an appositional independent pronoun or deictic ( mi pan-mav
2SG self-F SG 'you, yourself'; kapa pan-mampan-an lDL self-M DL-OBL
'both of us, ourselves'; m-um pan-put NR DIST-Il PL self-F PL 'those,
themselves'). The pronoun or deictic can be left out if the referent is
clear from the immediate context, and in any case, deictics are commonly
omitted with the contrastive pronouns. If a contrastive pronoun occurs
alone (7-18b), it is normally interpreted as third person unless contextual
features determine otherwise.
Complementation
Complementation is one of the most interesting and elaborated parts of
Yimas grammar, and is remarkably different in a number of ways from
the system of complements in many other languages, including other
Papuan languages. Complements are not all that common in Yimas
formal narrative discourse, but in everyday speech and conversation they
are frequently encountered.
Complements in Yimas are typically nominalizations and are formed
with - ru NFN. In other words, in order for a clause (the complement) to
function as an argument of another clause (the main or matrix clause),
it must be made non-finite through the process of nominalization. Com­
plement nominalizations are like nouns and nominals generally in being
affixed with suffixes to mark noun class; we have already seen this with
the suffixes - awt M SG, etc. It is these class suffixes which indicate the
different types of complements. In addition to the agentive nominaliza­
tions marked by - awt M SG, etc., there are four types of complements in
Yimas: complements of speech or language, marked by -mpwi; comple­
ments of desire (-wampuv ) , complements of action (-nti), and comple­
ments of customary action (-wal) . The semantics of each type will be
discussed below, but first I wish to present the general syntactic features
of Yimas complementation structures.
The first point about Yimas nominalized complements is that they
7.1.2NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS385have the basic syntactic structure of compounds. Remember that Yimas
possesses a productive means of forming verb plus noun compounds
using the - t allomorph of -ru NFN (see Section 4.4).
(7-21) a. ayk-t
yaw
yua-0
yak
marry-NFN road IX SG good-IX SG COP IX SG
'That's a proper match of marriage partners.'
tpuk
ku-n-kacapal
b. am-t
eat-NFN sago pancake X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot his sago for eating.'
The compounds in (7-21) are very close to complements. If we replace
the head noun of the compound in (7-21b) with complement markers
and specifically that of the complement of desire, - wampuv (nothing but
the class V noun meaning 'heart'), we derive a parallel complementation
structure of almost morpheme-for-morpheme similarity.
na-n-kacapal
(7-22) tpuk
am-tu-wampu:u
sago pancake )\ SG eat-NFN-heart V SG V SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He lost interest in eating sago.'
In (7-22) the head noun of the compound is wampuv 'heart', the indi­
cator of a complement of desire. This is what is marked on the verb as
the 0 participant by na- V SG 0, the class and number specifications
for wampuv 'heart'.
It is also possible for class markers by themselves to function as the
heads of verb plus noun compounds either with or without an overt
coreferential noun.
(7-23) a. tpuk
am-t-u:u
ku-n-kacapal
sago pancake X SG eat-NFN-X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot his sago for eating.'
b. am-t-u:u
ku-n-kacapal
eat-NFN-X SG X SG 0-3SG A-forgot
'He forgot his (sago) for eating.'
Example (7-23a) differs from (7-21b) in that the order of verb plus noun
has been altered, changing the embedding structure of modifier plus
head to one of two appositional nominals of the same class and number,
the second being headed by the class marker -uv X SG. This alternation
is no different from that involving possessors or adjectives.
(7-24) a. ama-na matn
1SG-POSS brother I SG
versus
ama-na-kn
matn
brother I SG 1SG-POSS-I SG
'my brother'INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS386b. kpa kay
big canoe VIII SG
versuskay
kpa-y
canoe VIII SG big-VIII SG
'a big canoe'
Example (b) in (7-23) is simply the second nominal in the appositional
arrangement of (7-23a) standing on its own. This clause would be used
whenever the context makes it clear what referent denoted by a class
X SG noun is being talked about (expressed by the suffix - uv X SG),
just as kpa-y big-VIII SG would generally be all that is necessary in a
discourse about canoes.
The examples in (7-23) are again very closely paralleled by comple­
ment structures.
(7-25) a. tpuk
am-tu-mpwi pia-n-kacapal
sago pancake X SG eat-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot to eat sago.'
b. am-tu-mpwi pia-n-kacapal
eat-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-forget
'He forgot to eat.'
In (7-25) the class marker - mpwi 'talk' is used to mark a nominalized
complement of speech; the complements could express the A partici­
pant's thoughts (thoughts are regarded as internal speech in Yimas), or
could paraphrase an order or exhortation directed to the A which was
forgotten. The class marker -mpwi 'talk' functions as the head of these
nominalized complements, so that in fact they have the syntactic struc­
ture of verb plus noun compounds. Since compounds have the following
syntactic structure,
(7-26)
N
---- ----s---- ---V
I
INNmawrun
enemyi!]kay
tu-t
kill-NFN
spear-V PL
'spears for killing enemies'
nominalized complements can be represented in rather the same way.
The complement in (7-22) has the structure (7-27), and (7-25) that of
(7-28).","[399, 400, 401, 402]"
"374THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREAs mentioned above, clausal constituents are generally words. The
only phrasal constituents that exist at the clause level are noun phrases
and postpositional phrases. As discussed in Section 4.6, Yimas has a very
restricted category of noun phrase, consisting of no more than two words
and generated by the following rules, repeated below for convenience
(where N true nouns, independent pronouns and deictics, as well as
nominalized adjectives and verbs).
(M) + N
(6-189) NP
POSSR
M
ADJ
=--t
--t{}NPs can be either direct (as in 6-190a) or oblique, taking the oblique
suffix as a single constituent ( 6-190b).
(6-190) a. ama-na patn
1SG-POSS betelnut V SG
'my betelnut'
b. rna pucmp-n
other time-OBL
'at another time'
Postpositional phrases parallel noun phrases in that the head always
occurs to the right; in this case, it is the postposition. Unlike noun
phrases which are highly restrictive in only allowing a single modifier to
occur before the head noun, postpositional phrases allow a number of
prehead modifiers, which correspond to nominals.
(6-191) a. makaw
mawnta
kantk
fish (sp) IX SG fish (sp) V SG with
'with makaw and catfish'
b. kumpwi kpa-y kpa-y kantk
boys I PL big-I PL big-I PL with
'with grown up boys'
The modifiers may even constitute a noun phrase,
(6-192) ama-na matn
kantk
1SG-POSS brother I SG with
'with my brother'
or they may be no more than a pronoun.
(6-193) a. ama-naJJkun
1SG-toward
'to my house'YIMAS CLAUSE STRUCTURES375b. mpu-nampan
3PL-toward
'toward them'
The two rules for generating postpositional phrases are therefore as
follows:
(6-194)pp-+0-+O+P
(NP) nApplying these rules to (6-191b) we get the phrase structure:
pp----0Ip---- � ----NPNPNPNINN/ '-.....

'with'As already discussed, at the actual clause level there are no hierarchi­
cal structure or ordering constraints among the constituents. Adapting
the convention of Gazdar et al. (1985) of using a comma for constituents
freely ordered, we can write the following rule for generating Yimas
clauses:
(6-195) S (NP) n , (PP) n , (X) n , V
where X indicates words belonging to minor word classes, such as tem­
porals and locationals.
Applying this rule and those in (6-189) and (6-194) to example
(6-196) we generate the phrase structure (6-197).

'with'The branches directly off S can be rotated and shifted around freely with
no change in meaning, but this is not true of the next level of branches,
those corresponding to the phrasal units and the V. We have already
seen that the internal structure of the V is highly complex and hierar­
chically ordered. It may be that the very simple structure of the clause
level in Yimas compensates for the highly elaborate structure at lower
levels, especially inside the V. It is a commonplace among modern lin­
guistic theories that internal hierarchical structure is a universal feature
of language. This may be true, but languages like Yimas demonstrate
that such a structure need not be manifested at the clause level, where
it is commonly expected, but may show up elsewhere, where it is less
expected, for example, in the internal structure of the words. It may be
a truism that polysynthetic languages like Yimas choose to elaborate the
internal structure of words in contradistinction to phrases and clauses.
If one glances back at the phrase structure rules in (6-189) and (6194), an obvious generalization about Yimas emerges: the heads of con­
structions always occur to their right. The question then arises as to
what is the head of a clause. The only obligatory constituent of a clause
is, of course, the verb, and the rightmost obligatory constituent of a
verb is the tense morpheme. I suggest then that we consider TNS as the
head of its clause. In other words, as a noun phrase is defined by its
head noun and a postpositional phrase by its head postposition, so is
the category S defined by the tense morpheme.",[392]
"416INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSAs with the evidence from the modally inflected verbs, the anomaly
of -nak 3SG 0 illustrates a nominative-accusative bias in this part of
Yimas grammar. Note that, when relativized, S and A participants
of these specific class and number features are coded alike, with 0
-n, while 0 participants are treated differently, requiring - nak. The
following examples make this very clear:
(7-83) a. namarawt [m-na-taw-n-0
mnti]
person I SG NR DIST-DEF-sit-PRES-3SG there
'the person who is sitting there'
b. namarawt [narmaJJ
m-tpul-0]
person I SG woman II SG NR DIST-hit-3SG
'the person who hit the woman'
c. namarawt [narmaJJ
m-n-tpul-c-ak]
person I SG woman II SG NR DIST-3SG A-hit-PERF-3SG 0
'the person whom the woman hit'
It is difficult to explain the reason for this form. It cannot be to eliminate
ambiguity, for the obligatory absence of any third person pronominal
prefixes in A relativization versus their presence in 0 relativization is
sufficient to accomplish this. Further this is exactly how disambiguation
is accomplished in the dual and plural which use the same concord suffix
regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun.
(7-84) a. namat

Relativization of the T argument of a ditransitive verb is simplest
if the D participant is first or second person and hence marked by a
pronominal prefix. Then, the concord suffix for the relativized T noun
simply follows the tense suffix.

If the D is third person and thus a suffix, the concord suffix for the
relativized T follows it, causing the D suffix to appear in its non-word­
final form.

Relativization of D participants presents a special problem. The
m- NR DIST stem always occupies one of the verbal pronominal pre­
fix positions potentially usurping the position for the prefix for the T
participant. The pronominal affixes for third person D participants are
suffixes following the tense suffix, and this is the position for the con­
cord suffix marking the class and number features of the noun modified
by the relative clause. Both of these present morphological difficulties
for relativization of D participants, and this is generally avoided in the
language. I have never encountered an example in spontaneous usage,
but in elicitation sessions I have been able to get speakers to produce
examples like the following, although given the context in which they
were obtained, it is probable that they are fairly stilted.
(7-87) kalakn [!Jaykum

V PL-3PL A-DEF-give-PRES-3SG D house-OBL
na-na-iray-n
3SG 8-DEF-cry-PRES
'The boy that the women gave food to is crying in the house.'
The relative clause in (7-87) has no unambiguous concord suffix nor m­
NR DIST. The verbal pronominal suffix in this example does double418INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSduty as both the relative clause concord marker and the affix for a third
person singular D participant. The stem m- NR DIST is completely
prohibited because of ya- V PL T. In fact, the modified noun plus the
relative clause looks like a main clause, and (7-87) is ambiguous between
a construction with a relative clause and one consisting of two conjoined
clauses with the meaning 'The women gave the food to the boy in the
house and he is crying.' What, in fact, can discriminate between these
two are word order constraints. If the first clause is simply one of two
conjoined clauses, then kalakn 'boy' can occur anywhere within it, say
between vaykum 'women' and amtra 'food'. If, however, it is the ex­
ternal modified noun of a relative clause, this is not possible. It must
always occur outside of the relative clause, either before it, as in (7-87),
or after it.
Yimas does not restrict relativization to core arguments only. The
language allows relative clauses to be formed by relativizing locationals
(and temporals, as well, but these will be discussed in Section 7.2.3).
When a locational is relativized, the clause describes the place at which
an event occurs, but locative relative clauses contrast with those formed
for core arguments in that they never permit a true head noun, al­
though a locational word or deictic may be present, as following exam­
ples illustrate:
(7-88) a. maramara mnti ya-n-ta-t

b. mawn (m-um

m-mpu-kaprak-war-a-n]
NR DIST-3PL A-cut skin-HAB-IX SG-OBL
'up there where they cut their skin'
The relative clause in the (a) example can only be construed as modify­
ing mnti 'there', but the class-number concord marker on the verb is - a
IX SG. This is the typical class-number marker for referring to places or
areas and may reflect a now lost noun referring to this concept (much
as - mpwi 'talk' and - nti 'act' probably do) . This may be related to
the prefix ta- found on the other locational deictics ta-k 'here' and ta-n
'there' or even more likely to the interrogative stem -vka 'where', both
of which end in -a and on phonological grounds are plausible members
of class IX. In any case, the relative clause is marked as modifying aFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS419class IX singular noun which clearly cannot be the locational deictic.
Rather we must assume some obligatorily missing noun of this class and
number specification which, in turn, is in apposition to the deictic. Sim­
ilar remarks apply to ( 7-88b), with the locational word mawn 'above'.
Sometimes there is not even a deictic or locational word to act as a stand
in head for a locative relative clause; they simply occur on their own as
in (7-89):
(7-89) a. [maramara m-mpu-ti-r-a-n]

Negative finite relative clauses are formed in the same way that
tensed clauses generally are negated, with the verbal prefix ta- NEG
(this obligatorily replaces m- NR DIST). In relative clauses, however,
ta- creates some problems because the morphological effect of negation
on a verb is very much like that of relativization: both require par­
ticipants normally coded by pronominal prefixes to appear as suffixes.
This can result in negative relative clauses being ambiguous (note that
the same result obtains with negation by -kakan 'without' used with
non-finite relative clauses).

ta-pu-n-tpul-c-ak]
person I SG woman II SG NEG-3-3SG A-hit-PERF-3SG 0
the woman did not hit.'
'the person that did
not hit the woman.'
The suffix -nak 3SG 0 could be either the result of negation or relative
clause formation. If the latter, it would identify the relativized noun as
in 0 function and thus require the first of the two possible readings. This
is, in fact, the preferred reading. If - nak 3SG 0 derives from negation,
then no conclusions are possible concerning the role of the relativized
noun and the relative clause is therefore compatible with a reading of it
being the A participant (the seeond meaning above). The only way to{}420INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSforce a reading of the A as being the relativized noun is not to code the
0 by a verbal affix at all.
(7-91) namarawt [narma!J
ta-pu-tpul-0]
person I SG woman II SG NEG-3-hit-3SG
'the person who hit the woman'
Here the bivalent verb tpul- 'hit' is formally intransitive, with just a
single participant coded by pu- . . .-0. The fact that the concord suffix on
the verb is 0 rather than - nak indicates that the relativized noun must
be A. Hence, this example is not ambiguous.
The placement of a relative clause (finite or non-finite) with respect
to its 'head' noun is free. It can precede the 'head' noun,

ative clauses normally function to provide definite descriptions for an en­
tity just being introduced in order to help the hearer identify it. To pro­
vide the definite description but omit the noun to which it applies is prag­
matically very odd and requires quite a marked context to be acceptable.
Example (7-95) belongs in a narrative context discussing crocodiles,
where the entity described by the relative clause is already well es­
tablished. The relative clause then functions contrastively, to select a
particular set of crocodiles out of the class which is already the topic.
The freedom of movement of relative clauses and their very weak
links to their 'head' nouns is fully in keeping with the analysis adopted
here that they are independent nominals in their own right, but appo­
sitionally linked to their head. Unlike other nominals, though, finite rel­
ative clauses are full clauses and partake of the grammatical features of
clauses. As discussed in Section 6.5, Yimas clauses are very loosely struc­
tured, with nominals (core and oblique) occurring in any order with re­
spect to the verb. Structurally, a Yimas clause is flat, with the verb and
nominal clauses all on the same level, as first order branches of S. Rel­
ative clauses have the same basic structure, and are just as free in their
word order possibilities. Thus, (7-96a,b) are both fully grammatical.

Relative clauses can assume any function in the main clause: core
arguments, obliques, or even constituents of possessive NPs. Most com­
monly they are linked to 'head' nouns in these functions and thus assume
the same functions, although the 'heads' can be missing, with the rela­
tive clauses bearing these functions on their own. Examples of relative

Note that in both of these examples, the relative clause follows the non­
finite verb ( it is possible for them to precede ) .
The above facts clearly demonstrate that finite relative clauses have
all the syntactic features and privileges of nouns, including class and
number, but at the same time remain full finite clauses, with tense real­
ized on the verb. They must be analyzed in the most basic terms as an
N realized as a clause. There are two morphological exponents of these
nominal features-m- NR DIST and the final concord suffixes-and so
the question arises as to which of these is the head of the construction,
i.e., that morpheme which actually makes the sentential constituent into
a noun phrase. This would be difficult to decide if it was not for one
small piece of evidence, and that is the concord suffix - nak 3SG 0. This
actually codes the function of the relativized noun, which is a clause­
internal constituent, not that of any constituent in the main clause.
Thus, its behavior is like that of a verbal pronominal affix within the
relative clause. This leaves m- NR. DIST to assume the function of theINTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS424head of the relative clause, and suggests a more formal structure like the
following:
(7-99)NP---- ---N
S
I
/ ""'-.
mX
PRONR DIST--This structure is anomalous in having its head on the left, because Vi­
mas otherwise is a consistent head to the right language. However, this
discrepancy must be faced with the deictics generally; consider the fol­
lowing deictic forms for class I SG:
na-n
m-n
(7-100) na-k
I SG-FR DIST
NR DIST-I SG
I SG-PROX
'that near you'
'that yonder'
'this'
Regardless of whether we choose the concord suffix or the deictic stem
as the head in these forms, at least one form will be anomalous. Sticking
to the majority head to the right pattern of Yimas, we can analyze the
proximal and far deictic forms as consisting of modifier + head, with the
head being the deictic stem. Applying this then to the near distal form,
we identify m- NR DIST as its head. This is unusual because the head
is on the left, but it does independently vindicate the structure (7-100)
suggested for relative clauses.
The stem m- NR DIST is not equivalent to the head noun of an
English relative clause such as the man who killed the crocodile. It is
equivalent rather to the main clause noun to which the relative clause
as a whole is paratactically linked.
Consider the structure of example (7-97a) , which is diagrammed
below in (7-101). Because m- is a form bound to the verb, noun ar­
guments of the relative clause occur before it, represented by the line
branching from the S of the relative clause and crossing over the ver­
tical line from the N of the relative clause. The concord suffix on the
verb of the relative clause marks the class and number (and the par­
ticipant role) of the relativized noun. These features are transferred
to m- NR DIST, much as - m on English who-m identifies that the
relativized noun is an object. Since m- NR DIST is the head of the
noun phrase, these features are also those of the noun phrase as a
whole. These finally are matched up to the features of the noun kaywi
'girl' which is thereby established as the noun modified by the relative
clause.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"
"10THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSTo the west of Yimas along the upper reaches of the Karawari river
and along the Wagupmeri river, lies the Alamblak language, spoken by
about 1200 people in a dozen villages. This is the easternmost language
of the Sepik Hill family, stretching away to the west to the West Sepik
provincial border and the south to the Southern Highlands provincial
border. This family is composed of 14 languages and is quite possibly
related to the languages of the middle Sepik area, such as the Ndu lan­
guages, Iatmul and Abelam. The evidence for this is merely suggestive,
however, and any conclusive proof of genetic relationship remains to be
produced.
Alamblak has exactly the same three-height vowel system as Ara­
fundi, but is phonetically very similar to Yimas in the heavy prepon­
derance of the epenthetic high central vowel. It also parallels Yimas in
the relatively recent appearance of the palatal series and in having a
productive synchronic rule of palatalization. It contrasts with Yimas,
Arafundi, and Enga in having a somewhat richer inventory of fricatives,
including those at the bilabial and velar positions. A further difference
from Yimas and Arafundi is the presence of a distinctive voiced stop
series, which, contra Enga, is not prenasalized.
Morphologically, Alamblak is most like Yimas, in spite of the lack of
any genetic affiliation. This seems to be the result of extensive diffusion
of structural traits over the centuries, which probably also accounts for
some of the phonological similarities. It must be emphasized that Yi­
mas and Alamblak share traits of general morphological structure; they
do not share any actual morphological cognates. Alamblak nouns are
inflected for gender and number. There is a three-way number distinc­
tion and a two-way gender distinction between masculine and feminine.
Gender in Alamblak is determined by biological sex or shape: long thin
objects are masculine and short squat objects are feminine. There is no
neutralization of person distinctions in the non-singular numbers, as in
Arafundi and Enga. Nouns functioning in core roles like subject and
object are not inflected for case, but there is a rather rich array of case
suffixes for oblique functions like instrumentals or locatives. Verbs are
again largely suffixing (in contrast to prefixing Yimas), the main pre­
fixes being those marking mood, like imperative and hortative. The
main suffixes are for tense, subject agreement and object agreement, in
that order. This contrasts with Arafundi, in which the object agreement
suffix precedes the tense suffix which in turn is followed by the subject
agreement morpheme. Like Yimas and Enga, Alamblak has a rich tense
system, distinguishing a number of past tenses according to the number
of days removed from today. The subject and object agreement suffixes
encode person and number, and for third-person singular, they encodeETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCH11gender as well, using the same affixes which code the gender and num­
ber of nouns. Alamblak further shares with Yimas a very productive
process of verb-compounding or serialization. Clause linkage is typically
achieved by nominalization and coordination, as in Yimas, but Alamblak
does make sparing use of switch-reference morphology (Bruce 1984).

1.3 Ethnographic SketchThe Yimas people can best be described as sedentary hunter-gatherers.
That is, while they live in permanent established villages, they do not
practice subsistence agriculture, but rather collect their food from the
surrounding forest and wetlands. The Yimas lands are very rich: the
main village is surrounded by a great expanse of swamp and eight major
lakes. These supply the staple protein source of the Yimas, fresh fish,
the most common species being tilapia, mosambia, called makau in Tok
Pisin and Yimas. The word is a loan into Yimas from Tok Pisin because
this fish species is not native to New Guinea, but South America. They
were introduced into the Sepik as the result of an accident at an ex­
perimental agricultural station in Maprik. By the mid-sixties they were
well established in the Yimas lakes. They seem to have largely replaced
indigenous species, and now constitute the largest proportion of any fish
catch. Second to makau in percentage of catch are native specifies of
catfish ( mawnta). Fishing is largely the province of the women, who use
nets purchased in towns and traditional traps woven from reeds in this
task. Men provide a relatively minor supplement of fish by spear fishing,
using multiple-prong spears.
Hunting is exclusively the domain of men. While fishing is done daily
by nearly all the women, hunting is a rather irregular, more infrequent
activity. The male members of the tribe vary greatly in their enthusi­
asm for hunting, some going out on a hunt a couple of times a week,
some never going. The major animals hunted are wild pigs ( numpran)
and possums ( tuvkntuma), but cassowaries ( awa), which are extremely
dangerous large flightless birds, and wallabies ( warkawpwi) , smaller re­
lations of kangaroos, are also taken, albeit rarely. Men also shoot ducks
( manpakwarv) and other wild birds, such as the large crowned pigeon
or gouria ( mpuvkan). Crocodiles ( manpa) are also eaten, but they are
never hunted as food per se. They are hunted for their skins, which are12THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERSdried and sold as a source of cash. The carcass of the crocodile is then
eaten. Meat from hunting is a much less important protein source in the
Yimas diet than fish, but it does provide a much-desired respite from a
constant bland fare of fish.
The staple carbohydrate for Yimas is sago derived from the sago
palm tree, Metroxylum rumphii ( tnum). The gathering of sago is a
cooperative effort involving both men and women. The men cut down
the sago palm, strip off its bark ( kapwa) , and pulverize (pan-) the pith
of the tree with blunt adzes ( awi) . The pulverized pith ( tki) is placed
in large woven baskets (pantimpram) and passed to the women. The
women set up a canoe with a small wooden frame at one end as the
catchment for the washed sago pith. The women wash ( tuk-) the sago
pith by placing it in another type of woven basket ( walamuv) , filling
it with water and squeezing the basket over the wooden frame. The
sago flour ( wampunv) flows out through the holes in the basket and,
being very heavy, collects in the bottom of the canoe. The women
finish washing the sago pith and then scoop out all the water from the
canoe. They then collect the sago flour and place it in clay storage pots
( yavi).","[25, 26, 27, 28]"

As mentioned briefly in Section 6.3.3, elevationals/directionals can oc­
casionally appear inside serial verb constructions, usually when the pre­
vious verb root is either wa- 'go' or ya- 'come' linked by ka- SEQ. In
other words, V2 constituents can occasionally be joined recursively with
other V2 constituents (when Vo wa- 'go'jya- 'come') to form another
v2 , as in the following:

This recursive property for V2 can be expressed formally as follows:THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURE362(6-170) V 2 V2 (Vo wa-/ ya-) + V2
The first V2 must be a minimal V2, i.e., can only consist of Yo plus the
linking morpheme -ka SEQ. The second V2 is not so constrained (see
(6-146b)).
The final derivational process of the verb theme is adverbial incorpo­
ration, both obligatory and optional (optionally incorporated adverbials
will have already been derived from adjectives and verbs elsewhere by
lexical rules). The language permits more than one incorporated ad­
verbial in a single V2 constituent (see example (6-120b)). The normal
position for incorporated adverbials is as the first morpheme of the verb
theme, so that (6-167) should be amended as follows:
(6-171) V2 ((ADV) n ) + (ELEV) + (VAL) + ( [V1 + [ [�Pi } ] ]n ) + V1

3.7 Pronouns
Yimas has a very rich inventory of pronominal forms, but most of these
are bound morphemes and will be discussed in the relevant sections of
the morphology. I will only be concerned here with pronouns which
are free independent words. True pronouns in Yimas only belong to
the first- and second-persons, i.e., refer to the speaker and addressee.
The so-called third-person pronouns refer to participants absent, or not
directly interacting in the immediate, ongoing speech act, and belong
to the word class of deictics in Yimas, to be treated in the following
section.
Besides two persons, Yimas distinguishes four numbers in its pro­
nouns: singular, dual, paucal (a few: from three up to about seven,
but variable depending on context) , and plural. The basic independent
pronouns are
DL
PC
PL
SG
1 ama
kapa
paukt
ipa
2 mi
kapwa

ipwa
I t. should be noted that for the non-singulars, the second-person formsderived from the first by an infix -w- (this goes back to Proto-Lower
S1�pik; see Foley 1986, 220-1). In fact, in the paucal there is no difference
whatsoever; the two forms are homophonous, the distinction being made
hy cross-referencing verbal person/number prefixes.
Compared to English, these pronouns are used relatively infrequently,
t.lwir basic categories being normally expressed by prefixes to the verb
(Hm� Section 5.1). The free pronouns can be used in combination withare112WORD CLASSESthe verbal prefixes, but then the pragmatic effect is generally contrastive,
i.e., ' it 's me (not you or anyone else) who . . . ' (see Section 5.1.6).
3.8 Deictics
As with many languages, deictics are a rather elaborated part of Yi­
mas grammar. The basic function of a deictic is to locate the position
of an object in space (or in some languages, in time (Becker 1974))
with respect to the positions of the participants in the speech act. The
basic participants in a speech act are the speaker, the addressee, and
the person spoken about (absent from the immediate speech act, but
nonetheless one of its topics). Yimas has a deictic stem corresponding
to each of these three positions. There is a deictic stem -k 'this (near
me)' to refer to things close to the speaker, a stem m- 'that (near you)'
for those close to the addressee and a stem - n 'that yonder (near neither
you nor me) '. All deictics agree in number and noun class with the noun
denoting the objects whose location they are specifying. The proximal
deictic -k and the far distal deictic - n take the set of verb prefixes, while
the near distal deictic m- takes the adjectival suffixes. So for class VII
we would have the following set of nine forms:
-n FR DIST
-k PROX
m- NR DIST
SG
m-n
p-k
p-n
pla-n
pla-k
mpl
DL
PL
pia-n
pia-k
m-rampl 'those two' is a contraction from m- the near distal stem plus - mpl
the adjectival class VII dual suffix.
These deictic forms can be used as modifiers of head nouns (like
adjectives) or as noun phrases in their own right (like pronouns). When
used like adjectives they most commonly occur after the head noun,
as in imp ram pk 'this basket', but this is by no means obligatory, and
the opposite order is also found, pk impram. The former are sometimes
elliptical versions of predicative uses of the deictics with the usual copula
deleted. So we would have examples like the following
(3-30) impram
p-k
papk
basket VII SG VII SG-PROX COP VII SG
'This is a basket.'
The copula in Yimas is a highly complex verb form with many irregu­
larities (see Section 5.1.5) . It agrees for person, number, and class with
the noun it predicates (in the above example, class VII SG) . The forms
of the copula with different person, number, and class combinations are
presented in Section 5.1.5. In the singular (and only for some classes)
the copula makes an additional distinction usually associated with de-DEICTICS113ictics in a number of languages. In these classes, there are two forms in
the singular for the copula, one used for objects which are visible and
one for things invisible.

bandicoot X SG X SG-PROX COP X SG VIS
'This is a bandicoot (seen) . '
b. awruk
akuk
bandicoot X SG COP X SG INVIS
'It's a bandicoot (unseen).'
The (a) examples above use the visible copula forms and identify ob­
jects seen by the speaker. These are largely identificational uses of the
copula, rather than predicational: the (a) examples would be uttered in
a context when the speaker is holding up a bandicoot or a lump of dirt
and identifying what it is. The (b) examples are used when describing
objects unseen by the speaker and largely correspond to predicational
uses of the copula. For example, (3-32b) would be uttered if on walking
through the bush one heard a rustling sound in the grass, while (331b) would be said if on swimming through the lakes one stood up and
touched bottom. (3-30), with a visible copula form, also corresponds to
a predicational usage and would be a likely answer to a question like
'what are you making?', asked while watching someone weaving. As the
object being woven is visible to both parties in this context, this demon­
�·ltrates that the semantic contrast of visible versus invisible is more basic
than that between identificational and predicational uses. In most cases
the two meanings coincide, so it is in fact difficult to extricate them.
AH mentioned above, the visible/invisible contrast is only found in the
singular and only with some classes; for further discussion of the uses of
the copula and a complete listing of all forms, see Section 5.1.5.
These deictics also function in Yimas as the third-person pronouns.
The unmarked form in this usage is the near distal deictic. In ongoing
narrative discourse, it is this set of forms which are most commonly
used as free pronouns. But in direct quotes in and in normal everyday
('onversational discourse, all three basic forms are employed with the
following meanings. Forms based on the proximal deictic stem -k are
used to refer to participants or objects within the immediate contextWORD CLASSES1 14of the speech act. So in talking about a child sitting next to the two
interlocutors, one would use the form na-k, the proximal form for class
I and II singular, the classes for human beings. The choice between the
near distal and the far distal stems is more subtle. If one wishes to
emphasize the position of the participant or object as being near the
addressee, one could use the near distal stem. Similarly, if one wishes to
emphasize its distance from both major participants, one could use the
far distal form. But both of these reasons for their use would be unusual
and would result in a quite emphatic reading on the deictic, i.e., 'that
thing right here near you' or 'that thing which is certainly far away, not
near you or me'. More commonly, the choice of the near or far distal
deictic stem reflects the centrality of the participant in the discourse or
the speaker's empathy toward it. So, for example, one would talk about
a child using m-n, the near distal form for classes I and II singular, if
he was a central participant in the discourse or we felt good feelings
toward him. The far distal form na-n, on the other hand, is likely to be
used if we are angry at the child or if he is of only passing, secondary
interest.
Corresponding to each of the deictic stems is deictic adverb of place.
These are formed from the same stems plus an affix.
ta-k
m-nti
ta-n'here (near me)'
'there (near you)'
'there (near neither me nor you)'Again the stems -k and -n occur with a prefix in this case ta-, while
m has a suffix - nti. These forms are closely related to the interrogative
deictic, meaning 'where'. Yimas has a stem vka, meaning 'where?',
to which is added the same set of prefixes found on the deictic stems
-k and -n. The basic form is ta-vka 'where', which is used when the
location of an action is queried or when the speaker wishes to be vague
about the object whose location is requested. In all other cases in which
the location of a known object is being sought, the stem -vka must be
prefixed with the proper verbal prefix for the class of the object. Quite
clearly, in Yimas the word 'where?' is a verb. Consider the following
question in (a) with its answer in (b) , employing the class VII singular
noun impram 'basket'.

b. impram
basket VII SG hook VII SG-OBLDEICTICS115p-na-apca-mpi-irm-n
VII SG 8-DEF-hang-SEQ-stand-PRES
'The basket is hanging on the hook. '
In the interrogative (a) sentence, the - vka 'where?' functions as the main
verb, taking the normal verbal prefix for its nominal argument. -vka is
a rather defective verb. It cannot be inflected for any typically verbal
categories like tense, mood, or aspect, nor can it mark the number of its
nominal argument by the prefix; it can mark only class.

'when'
As can be clearly seen many of these interrogative words are based on
the stem wara 'what' plus suffixes of nominalizations and complements.
This suggests that like -vka 'where' , wara also has verbal characteristics.
Another set of words to be considered in this section are adverbs of
manner derived from the deictics of place. These are formed by adding
the adverbial suffix - mpi to the proximal and near distal adverbs:
tak 'here' + -mpi > takmpi 'like this'
mnti 'there' + -mpi > mntmpi 'like that'
Interestingly, this suffix can be added to the word tavka 'where?' to
form a derived verb (further demonstrating its status as a verb), as in
the following example:
(3-34) tauka-mpi ya-n-ntak-t
mnta
where-ADV V PL 0-2SG A-leave-PERF then
ma-ya-t
2SG S-come-PERF
'You left (things) where and now you came?'
Here the things left behind are left unspecified, cross-referenced by the
vague, unmarked plural prefix ya- (probably understood as referring to1 16WORD CLASSESthe noun maramara 'things, possessions') . There is no real semantic con­
trast between this sentence and one with the underived tavka, although
the tavkampi form is more likely to be used with action verbs ( espe­
cially motion verbs) and tavka with stative or position verbs. Perhaps
a more accurate translation, then, of tavkampi would be 'in a where-ing
manner? '.
Finally, there are two stems, which on morphological and to a certain
extent semantic grounds, seem best assigned to the deictic word class.
These are kawvkwan- 'something like _' and mntn- 'this sort of _'.
Like the near distal deictic stem m-, these take the adjectival concord
suffixes indicating the class and number of their modified noun.

3 . 9 Conjunctions
Yimas has only three conjunctions tay 'and then', mnta 'and then' and
kanta 'but'. The second two are obviously built on a stem - nta, to which
is added the near distal deictic stem m- or a negative prefix ka-. Both
of these are coordinating conjunctions. Yimas lacks a disjunctive coor­
dinating conjunction, i.e., 'or' , and all subordinating conjunctions. The
meanings of the latter are expressed through bound affixes to verbs,
sometimes in combination with temporal stems. The conjunction tay
normally introduces a new sentence, but may function to conjoin clauses
within a single sentence. The other two conjunctions kanta and mnta
normally occur after the first element of the second clause they are con­
joining, rather than between the two clauses (as do their English equiv­
alents), although that position is also possible. Consider this example:mnta

4.3 Proper NounsProper nouns correspond to names for persons and places in Yimas. All
inhabitants of Yimas village are given a traditional Yimas name at birth,
which stays with them throughout life, although they may acquire addi­
tional names as they mature. This traditional name is generally that of
legendary or mythological ancestor, usually belonging to the same clan
n170NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESas the conferee. As with many Sepik societies (Bateson 1936; Gewertz
1983), knowledge of long lists of names for totemic ancestors is a val­
ued resource for Yimas clans, so there is an enormous pool of available
names to draw on for any newborn child. As Yimas is a missionized,
Catholic village, almost all inhabitants also have a Christian name, be­
stowed by the priest at baptism. These are names of saints or other
Biblical characters. In daily social intercourse in the village, the great
majority normally go by these Christian names; the traditional names
are more commonly used in ceremonial indigenous contexts. Traditional
names are also commonly associated with contexts for Yimas vernacu­
lar, while Christian names are almost invariably employed in contexts
for Tok Pisin. For official, governmental purposes, Yimas people go by
their Christian name plus the traditional name of their father, following
the Anglo-Saxon convention in this regard. Thus, my primary language
helper, whose traditional name is Yakayapan, is found on the electoral
rolls as Stephen Mambi , his Christian name plus the traditional name
of his (adopted) father.
All significant areas in the territory of the Yimas have names which
designate them. Within the immediate area of the village, a separate
name may cover areas as small as a hundred square meters, but outside
of this area, the regions enclosed by a particular name are usually much
larger. Still, all hills, mountains, or even sub-parts of mountains, parts of
lakes, and lake shorelines, sections of the river, and canals have separate
names. Sometimes, these names are based on common nouns, coining
a proper noun from these to name the place according to some salient
physical feature. But this is rather rare. More commonly, a place takes
the name of some legendary person who died or performed an important
action there. But most commonly, the name is unanalyzable and has no
personal legendary precursor.
Proper nouns contrast with common nouns in that they are assigned
to no noun class and they never take number inflections. Proper nouns
designating the names of persons are also completely prohibited from oc­
curring with the oblique suffix. The proper nouns denoting place names
are more complicated. A few place names based on a common noun,
such as Kpa-upnk-n big-lake-OBL 'the largest of the eight major lakes
in the Yimas territory', have the oblique suffix as part of the name.
But in these cases it is semantically and syntactically empty, for it is
always present, regardless of the syntactic function of the nominal. It is
simply fossilized as a constituent in the compound which makes up the
name of the lake. Other than these fossilized cases, proper nouns denot­
ing place names generally cannot occur with the oblique suffix. When
being used locatively they appear simply in their stem form. There isNOUN COMPOUNDS171one exception: proper nouns denoting the names of villages do generally
take the oblique suffix when being used locatively. Some examples are
Tamprakmat-n Yimas-OBL 'at Yimas', Kapakampt-n Imanmeri-OBL 'at
Imanmeri', and Kaywal-pan Kaiwaria-OBL 'at Kaiwaria'. Note that the
morphological forms with these village names can be quite exceptional.
The proper name for Yimas village is Tamprakmal, so by the usual al­
lomorphic rules for - n - nan, the form chosen should be *-nan, rather
than -n.
f'V4.4 Noun CompoundsBoth nouns and verbs, the major, open word classes in Yimas, compound
freely. Verbal compounds are an extremely common and pervasive fea­
ture of Yimas (see Section 6.3.1). Noun compounds are rather less com­
mon, but still are not infrequently encountered. Noun compounds by
definition always have nouns as their heads, and it is the noun class and
number of the head noun which determines these features for the com­
pound as a whole. The other member of the compound (there are no
examples with more than two basic constituents) may be either a verb
or another noun or noun phrase (see Section 4.6).
Compounds made up of two noun roots are the most common type.
The language has a few examples of lexical compounds formed directly
by juxtaposing two stems. This is non-productive, and sometimes the
non-head stem is not an isolatable morpheme in the language, i.e., these
are examples of 'cranberry' morphemes (Nida 1949). Examples of this
kind of non-productive compounding follow:
(4-34) a. wala-kput
wind( wal )-rain V SG
'heavy storm'
b. kampat-paympan
?-eagle V SG
'small brown and white hawk'
c. Parampt-paympan

'totemic ancestor'
d. kayan-taki
spirit-stone/spirit I SG

e. anti-Jlam-n

blood?(yat)-liver V SG
'spleen'
g. irwan
pkam
white possum V SG skin of back
'hide of white possum'
The much more common and productive way of forming noun plus
noun compounds in Yimas is to suffix the first (the non-head) noun with
the oblique suffix. The oblique suffix occurs in the allomorph proper to
that noun. Examples follow:
(4-35) a. muca-n
marm
flower (sp) IX SG-OBL smell V SG
'smell of muca flower'
b. puratuuk-n
tampan
bile VI SG-OBL liver V SG
'gall bladder'
numpran
c. num-n
village-OBL pig III SG
'domesticated pig'
d. narmau-n wurm
woman-OBL flute VII SG
'female (i.e., smaller) flute'
e. kalk-n
apra
sago pudding V SG-OBL plate VII PL
'plates of sago pudding'
yaw
f. pukmp-n
guts VII SG-OBL road IX SG
'intestines'
yanu
g. yanan
tree V SG-OBL stick VI SG
'tree branch'
h. namtamparawt-jlan api-c-awt
foot IX DL-OBL
put inside-NFN-SG
'sock' (i.e., something into which the two feet are put)
The last example is interesting in that the head noun is actually a verb
which has been nominalized by - ru (realized as - c ) and -awt (see Section
7.1.1 on nominalizations of verbs) . The semantic relations between the
nouns in these compounds are part/whole (e,g), characteristic property
(a,b,c), and location or goal (c,f,h).
Generally in these compounds, the noun marked by the oblique suffixNOUN COMPOUNDS173may not be inflected for number: (4-35h) is one of the few examples that
shows that this is indeed possible, though such cases are rather rare.
Other cases are the words 'male' and 'female' from panmal 'man' and
narmav 'woman', which seem to vary freely between singular and plural
in some cases,
wurm
( 4-36) a. narmau-n
woman II SG-OBL flute VII SG
'female flute'
b. uaykump-n
wurm
woman II PL-OBL flute VII SG
'female flute'
but not in others.
( 4-37) a. uaykump-n
kumpwi
woman II PL-OBL child I PL
'girls'
b.*narmau-n
kumpwi
woman II SG-OBL child I PL
This difference may simply reflect the fact that (4-37a) is actually a
lexical entry, the plural form of kaywi 'girl, daughter'.
Proper nouns may also occur in noun compounds, as the non-head
noun, but as usual they occur without the oblique suffix.
( 4-38) a. Malukawt
yaw-n
place of the dead road IX SG-OBL
'on the road to Malukawt'
b. Kapakampt kaywi
Imanmeri girl II SG
'girl from Imanmeri'
c. Kamrat
namat
place in big lake person I PL
'people of Kamrat'
num
d. Wamut
Wambramas village
'Wambramas village'
As mentioned above, noun plus noun compounds may consist of ex­
actly two major constituents (see Section 4.6) . Compounds as a whole
may be modified by other elements, in which case the resulting con­
Ht.ituency may at first seem ambiguous.
[karm]]]
( 4-:m) a. [ama-na
[[num-n]

b. [[ama-na num-n]
1SG-POSS village-OBL lip/language VII SG
'my native language' (i.e., 'the language of my village')
This string could be analyzed at first as having either the constituency of
(4-39) (a) or (b); it is impossible to determine this from the meanings in
these cases, as they are identical. As soon as the head noun is switched
from karm 'lip/language' to numpran 'pig', however, it becomes possible
to determine that the constituency of (a) is correct for (4-39).
[numpran]]]
(4-40) [ama-na [[num-n]
1SG-POSS village-OBL pig III SG
'my domesticated pig' (i.e., 'my village pig')
If one wanted to express the equivalent of the constituency outlined in
(4-39b), i.e., 'the pig of my village', a compound construction would not
be possible. Rather we would need a construction something like ( 4-41)
in which a finite relative clause modifying numpran 'pig' is employed:
ama-na-num-n
(4-41) numpran [num-n
pig III SG village-OBL lSG-POSS-village-OBL
m-ya-t]
NR DIST-come-PERF
'a pig which came from my village'
Further evidence that the constituency diagrammed in (4-39a) and (440) is correct for nominal compounds comes from the behavior of ad­
jectival modifiers. These always modify the compound as a whole and
have the number/class features of the second (i.e., head) noun. They
are prohibited from ever agreeing with these features for the first noun.
(4-42) a. [kpa-n
[num-n
numpran]]
big-III SG village-OBL pig III SG
'my big domesticated pig'
b.*[kpa-nm
num-n]
numpran]
big-village SG village-OBL pig IV SG
The impossibility of (4-42b) clearly demonstrates that the actual con­
stituency for nominal compounds is that of (4-42a).
These noun plus noun compounds bear a superficial similarity to
noun plus postposition constructions. Compare these noun plus postpo­
sition constructions with the noun compounds in (4-35):
(4-43) a. nam-n
wampll{)n
house-OBL inside
'inside of the house'NOUN COMPOUNDS175b. yan-an
akpJlan
tree V SG-OBL behind
'behind the tree'
As with noun compounds, the first noun bears the oblique suffix. But
this similarity is more apparent than real, for the constituency of these
noun plus postposition constructions is quite different. When a modifier
is added, it modifies only the noun, not the whole construction, which
argues for the constituency in (4-44):
(4-44) [[[kaw!Jkra-k-n yan]-an]
akpJlan]
long-IRR-V SG tree V SG-OBL behind
'behind the tall tree'
In this example, the whole noun phrase kawvkra-k-n yan-an is embedded
under the postposition. Also, the noun and the postposition can be
separated by modifiers, something not possible within noun compounds:
( 4-45) [[[yan
kaw!Jkra-k-n]-an]
akpJlan]
tree V SG long-IRR-V SG-OBL behind
'behind the tall tree'
Noun compounds are also formed with a verb root functioning as
the non-head constituent. The verb roots occur in the same pre-head
position, but are suffixed with the nonfinite suffix -ru (for the rules for
the allomorphic variation of this suffix, see Section 7.1.1).
( 4-46) a. araka(l)-t mura!J
paddle-NFN paddle VI SG
'a paddle for paddling'
b. pan-t
impram
pound sago-NFN basket VII SG
'a basket used for carrying pounded sago pith to the washing
place'
c. ayk-t
yaw
marry-NOM road IX SG
'rule for a proper marriage'
Verbs occurring in these noun compounds obligatorily lack tense suffixes
and the cross-referencing affixes for core arguments. However, a noun
functioning as the object of the verb in the compound can appear overtly.
(1-47) [[tamana tu-t]
[kalk]]
sickness kill-NFN sago-pudding V SG
'sago pudding for curing sickness'
I n these cases the complex consisting of the noun object plus verb func­
tions as the first constituent of the noun compound.
It is also possible for a verb plus noun compound to occur as the first176NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASESconstituent of a noun plus noun compound. These structures fit well into
the overall structure of Yimas complex nominals, for the language has a
structural principle requiring heads on the right. When verb plus noun
compounds occur as non-head members of noun plus noun compounds,
this target is met serially; the two noun heads are adjacent to each other
to the right of the verb as follows:
[[verb - ru noun] noun]
Examples of such compounds follow:

4 . 5 PossessionAs in many languages, possession in Yimas is best characterized as an
oblique relation, i.e., the semantic relation between possessor and pos­
sessed is paraphrasable by English prepositions like 'with', 'to', or 'at'.
This is most transparently indicated in Yimas when possession is ex­
pressed clausally, in examples like 'I/you/etc. have a chair'. In these
cases the possessor functions as the subject of the clause whose predi­
cate is the copula, and the thing possessed appears as the object of a
postpositional construction with kantk- 'with, along with' ( tak- is an
alternative when the possessed noun is a body part). The postposition
kantk- occurs with an agreement suffix of the adjectival suffix set, indi­
cating the number and class of the possessor. Consider these examples:
kantk-n amayak
( 4-49) a. ama tkt
lSG chair V SG with-1 SG COP lSG
'I have a chair.'
b. impa-n
arm kantk-nprum aympak
3DL-FR DIST water with-11 PL COP 3DL
'Those two (females) have kerosene.'
c. ipwa tawra kantk-um aypwak
2PL money with-1 PL COP 2PL
'You have money.'
These uses of kantk- 'with' to express possession are no different from
its other uses, such as comitative.
Nouns marked by kantk- and hence functioning as oblique nominals
may under certain semantic conditions (see Section 6.2.3.3.1) becomePOSSESSION177core nominals by increasing the valency of the verb with tav- COM, i.e.,
kantk- peripheral nominals correspond to tav- core nominals. Compare
( 4-49a) above with ( 4-50):
( 4-50) arm ma-na-tau-taw-n
water 2SG S-DEF-COM-sit-PRES
'Do you have kerosene?'
This use of kantk 'with' to indicate possession is obviously closely
related to its use with the adjectival nouns (see Section 3.3). Since
these function syntactically as nouns, the relationship to the nouns they
modify is close to one of possession, and so it is no surprise that the
same construction is available, among others (see Section 3.3).
(4-51) a. ama tamana
kantk-n amayak
lSG sickness IX SG with-I SG COP lSG
'I am sick.'
b. ipa wapun
kantk-um aypak
lPL happiness V SG with-I PL COP lPL
'We are happy.'
These examples with adjectival nouns contrast with examples involving
true possessives, in that when the adjectival noun becomes a core ar­
gument it does so directly; tav- COM is completely unacceptable in the
same meaning.
( 4-52) a. wapun
ama-na-pay-n
happiness V SG lSG S-DEF-carry-PRES
'I'm feeling happy.'
b.*wapun
ama-na-tau-pay-n
happiness V SG lSG S-DEF-COM-carry-PRES
(Example (4-52b) is acceptable in the meaning 'My clan is happy' where
tav- COM marks the members of one's clan, literally 'I (with my clan)
am happy'. This is a true comitative usage). Further, when adjectival
nouns become core arguments, they often function as subjects of their
dauses. This is impossible for truly possessed items.

the copula, it can also be indicated nominally, often as part of a noun
phrase. If a noun phrase is formed of the possessor plus possessed, the
possessor precedes the possessed item and is followed with the possessive
marker na.

c. Yakayapan na ka-Jlan

POSS canoe VIII SG-OBL lSG S-go-IRR
'I will go in Yakayapan's canoe.'
The possessive marker na normally is a particle rather than a bound
affix. It takes stress, although not full primary stress. Rather like
English 's POSS, it can follow and have scope over whole phrases or
clauses.
na

fire NR DIST-DUR-carry-sit-DUR-RM PAST POSS
kalakn
child I SG
'The one who looks after the fire's child'
The embedded structure is a finite relative clause (see Section 7.2.1).
Possessive constructions consisting of possessor plus na plus pos­
sessed form tightly knit noun phrases. The word order is rigid: no
permutations are possible and nothing may be inserted between the two
constituents. The head of the construction is the possessed noun, as
demonstrated by the fact that it is this noun which is cross-referenced
on the verb (see example (4-54a)). In all these features, possessor plus
possessed noun phrases are exactly like noun plus noun compounds, and
the close similarity between the possessive suffix na and the oblique
suffix - n ""' - nan would seem not to be coincidental. We have already
documented above the claim that the relation of possession in Yimas is
an oblique one, like the relationship between the nouns marked by the
oblique suffix. It appears then that the fundamental relationships be­
tween the nouns in a nominal compound and a possessive noun phrase
are very closely related, if not identical. Further evidence for this view
is provided by examples like the following:POSSESSION179( 4-56) a. tu:ukntuma na-kn
marm
possum III SG POSS-V SG smell V SG
'smell of a possum'
b. mlmp-n
marm
feces VII SG-OBL smell V SG
'smell of feces'
(4-56a) is a possessor-possessed construction while (4-56b) is a noun
plus noun compound. The head noun marm 'smell' is identical in both
cases, and it could hardly be claimed that the basic relationship between
the nouns is very different in the two examples. However, there is a
subtle semantic difference between these two, which is responsible for
the difference in construction. The smell of a possum may be important
in a particular discourse, but is not normally taken as a permanent,
pervading characteristic of the animal, while the smell of feces is. The
difference between transitory qualities and characteristic properties is an
important semantic contrast throughout Yimas grammar and realized in
number of different ways and constructions, as we shall see in Chapters
6 and 7. It is this contrast which is being realized here in the choice
between a possessive noun phrase construction or a noun compound.
Another factor probably relevant here is that na POSS is restricted to
the animate nouns, the only possible true possessors.
Common and proper nouns functioning as possessors are simply suf­
fixed with na POSS. First and second person possessors use the indepen­
dent pronoun forms (see Section 3. 7), while the forms for third person
are closely related to the verbal prefixes for third person (see Section
aG . l .2.1).","[184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"

Another morphologically induced stress peculiarity concerns adjecti­

a nominal concord marker, regardless of the number of syllables of the

Note that this rule blocks the operation of the secondary stress rule (217) for the pentasyllabic words. Normally, these would have secondary
stress on the antepenultimate syllable by rule (2-17), but rule (2-20) is
more restricted in its domain and hence overrides it, so that the sec­
ondary stress appears on the penultimate syllable, the final syllable of
the roots.
The final morphologically induced peculiarity of stress concerns verbs
inflected with pronominal prefixes (see Section 5.1.1). These arc norkantamdhnurkupwicdkin

2.6 Boundaries and the Notion of the Word
If one approaches the notion of word from a formal perspective, it is
clear that it can be defined in either of two ways: either by phonological
criteria or by morphosyntactic ones. (Di Sciullo and Williams (1987)
have recently proposed that this latter actually disguises two distinct
types of criteria for the word, morphological ones versus syntactic ones.
They propose some very useful and interesting ideas, but for the pur­
poses here we will treat both of these types under the single category
of morphosyntactic criteria) . A word can be determined by phonolog­
ical criteria in terms of the rules, both segmental and suprasegmental,
whose domain is specified with respect to this notion. For example,
Yimas provides a number of rules which help us to determine words.
The final nasal plus stop cluster simplification rule (2-14) only applies
at the ends of words; initial semivowel formation (2-10) only applies at
the beginning of words; and most of the other rules, such as R spreading
(2-8), (but not, notably, palatalization (2-3)) occur internally to a word.
In addition, the stress rules of Yimas discussed in the previous section
also help to define the word, for they supply to every word unit at least
a primary stress and possibly one or more secondary stresses. Thus, any
string of phonemes which behave as a unit with respect to these rules can
be designated as a word and set off by the word boundaries before and
after it. So because the underlying phoneme sequence /awklmp/ 'wrist'
is realized phonetically as (awkulim] (from initial syllable primary stress
(2-16), vowel epenthesis (2-2), R spreading (2-8), and final nasal plusBOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD81stop cluster simplification (2-14) ) , we know that it constitutes a single
word with the placement of word boundaries thus /# awklmp #/.
Turning now to morphosyntactic criteria, we can state analogously
that a word is a string of morphemes that behaves as a single unit
with respect to morphological processes in the language. The strictly
morphological processes of a language, of course, are a language-specific
fact: some languages such as Vietnamese may have no morphological
processes at all; others, like Yimas, have an exuberance of these. Let
me first consider the morphological patterns of nouns in Yimas. Nouns
are marked for number in Yimas, as well as case. Thus, consider the
above noun 'wrist' inflected for these two categories: jawklmp + l +
nan/ wrist + DL + OBL realized phonetically as [awkulimbitJlan]
'on the two wrists'. The plus sign here is used conventionally to mark
a morpheme boundary, i.e. , a boundary between morphemes internal
to a word. This form is morphologically a single composite unit. The
morphemes must occur in this order and no other:
jawklmp + l + nan/ wrist + DL + OBL,
* jawklmp + nan + 1/ wrist + OBL + DL,
* /1 + awklmp + nan/ DL + wrist + OBL, etc.
Further, no other morphemes may be inserted internal to this sequence:
* jawklmp + kpa + l + nan/ wrist + big + DL + OBL,
* /awklmp + l + kpa + nan/ wrist + DL + big + OBL,
* / awklmp + prpal + l + nan/ wrist + two + DL + OBL,
* jawklmp + l + prpal + nan/ wrist + DL + two + OBL.
From the grammatical point of view, this noun forms a composite unit,
a word, and should therefore be represented as /# awklmp + l + nan
# /, with both the internal morpheme boundaries + and the external
word boundary # indicated.
Note that the grammatical criteria in this case coincide with the
phonological criteria in defining this as a single word-level unit. Whereas
the uninflected form jawklmp/ undergoes final nasal plus stop clus­
ter simplification (2-14) to surface as [awkulim], thus indicating a word
boundary, this rule fails to apply to j awklmp + l + nan/, which is re­
alized as [awkulimbftJlan] . This leaves no doubt that there is no word
boundary between the root for 'wrist' and the DL suffix in this form.
This is buttressed by the fact that the fp/ is voiced to [b] following the
nasal. Postnasal voicing of stops in Yimas is all but obligatory internal to
a word. Further, the liquid strengthening rule (2-5) applies in this form
between the /-1/ DL and the initial /n/ of the oblique suffix /-nanj.
T his rule, like most phonological rules treated earlier, is restricted to82PHONOLOGYapplying internally to the word across morpheme boundaries. (Palatal­
ization (2-3) is the one exception here: it does commonly apply across
word boundaries.) Clearly, then, both the grammatical criteria and the
phonological criteria unambiguously identify /awklmp + 1 + nan/ wrist
+ DL + OBL [awkulimbitJlan] as a single word.
Similar considerations apply to adjectives. Consider the form of the
adjective 'big' which would modify the inflected noun above: /kpa +
mp + 1/ big + class VII + DL, realized as [kipambH] . This demonstrates
that adjectives are inflected for the class and number of their modified
noun. Again the ordering of morphemes is rigid.
* /kpa + 1 + mp/ big + DL + class VII,
* jmp + kpa + 1/ class VII + PL + big;
and nothing may be inserted between the morphemes.
* /kpa + prpal + mp + 1/ big + two + class VII + DL,
* /kpa + mp + prpal + 1/ big + class VII + two + DL,
* /kpa + plak + mp + 1/ big + this + class VII + DL,
* /kpa + mp + plak + 1/ big + class VII + this + DL.
All this indicates that /kpa + mp + 1/ big + class VII + DL is a com­
posite unit, a single word. Again the phonological criteria bring down
the same verdict. The class VII concord marker /-mp/ appears phonet­
ically as [mp] , rather than as its word final allomorph [m] derived by
final nasal plus stop cluster simplification (2-14). Clearly there is no
word boundary between the class VII concord marker and the DL suffix,
so that the form can be established as / # kpa + mp + 1 # /.
The coincidence between phonological and grammatical criteria for
determining word boundaries vanishes, however, when we turn to verbs.
They are by far the most morphologically complex part of speech in
Yimas, but here I will concern myself only with negation and valence­
increasing, both of which are marked by prefixes. Negation is an espe­
cially good diagnostic of words, for it affects both the first morpheme of
a word and the last. Negation is marked by a prefix ta-. which occupies
the first prefixal slot of the verb, usurping the normal occupier of this
slot, a pronominal prefix, and shifting this to the final suffixal slot of the
word. Thus, consider the following pair:
(2-22) a. tampaym
p-ka-apca-t
hook VII SG VII SG 0-lSG A-hang up-PERF
'I hung up the hook.'
b. tampaym
ta-ka-apca-r-m
hook VII SG NEG-lSG A-hang up-PERF-VII SG 0
'I didn't hang up the hook.'","[94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"
"THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS199This example demonstrates that the basic underlying ergative-absolutive
basis of the third person prefixes weighs more heavily in determining
their form than the constraints imposed by linear order. Here the third
person plural S participant is still coded by the S form pu- and not the
A form mp u-, in spite of the fact that it occurs in the normal second
position of the A prefix. Thus, for third person prefixes, linear order can
cause an A participant to be coded by a S or 0 prefix form if outranked
by a first or second person 0 participant, as in (5-9) (although that is
only optional if the 0 participant is first person) . But it will not cause an
S participant to be indicated by an A prefix form even if its pronominal
prefix occurs in second position, the normal position of A, as a result of
a modal prefix preceding it.
This does happen, however, with first and second person partici­
pants. There, the accusative pattern with modally inflected verbs re­
ally does reflect the underlying pattern, for there are no linear order
constraints prohibiting the A or the 0 prefix from occurring in second
position (look back at examples (5-6b,c)). The S prefix forms for first
and second person participants are closely related to the correspond­
ing independent pronoun forms (see Section 5.1.2), and in most cases
simply seem to be these pronouns bound to the verb stem. No other
prefixes are allowed to precede these normal S forms. The other two
prefixes for first or second person participants-those for A and 0-do
allow prefixes to precede them, typically a prefix for a third person core
participant (again see examples (5-6b,c)) . When a verb with an associ­
ated S participant is inflected with a modal prefix, one of the two prefix
forms which allow a preceding prefix must be chosen, and it must be
that which would normally mark an A.
(5-12) a. ant-ka-tmuk-t
POT-lSG A-fall-PERF
'I almost fell down. '
b. * ant-va-tmuk-t
POT-lSG 0-fall-PERF
Both examples illustrate first person singular S participants, but this
participant must be realized by the A prefix form ka- (5-12a) and not the
0 form va- (5-12b) . Given what has been presented about the language
HO far, either option could be expected, but the fact that the language
chooses the A form to reference an S participant clearly identifies an
accusative pattern. S and A are conflated here rather than the ergative
pattern of S and 0. This fact clearly argues that underlying the usual
three-way split of role marking for first and second person participants,
i .e . , treating all three distinctly (as is found with verbs without modalBASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY200inflection) , is a basic nominative-accusative schema, which conflates S
and A and opposes this to 0 . We will see more evidence for this claim
as the exposition proceeds.
5.1.2 The Prefixes and Their Combinations
The pronominal prefixes in Yimas for each of the three functions A,
S , and 0 and for all person-number combinations are presented below.
The independent pronouns for first and second persons also appear for
comparison with the S forms (there are, of course, no true pronouns for
third person, that function being simply filled by the various deictics for
the different noun classes discussed in Chapter 4).

miThe person-number combinations are arranged in what seems to be a
rough Silversteinian hierarchy of feature markedness (Silverstein 1976).
Only the highest ranked combination, first dual, fails to distinguish A
and 0. It uses the same prefix vkra- 1DL for both A and 0 and contrasts
this to an S form kapa-, derived in the typical fashion from the indepen­
dent pronoun kapa 1DL. Verbs using this vkra- 1DL are ambiguous
between the A and 0 interpretation.
(5-13) pu-vkra-tay
3PL A/0-lDL A/0-see
'We two saw them.' or
'They saw us two.'
Note that the 3PL prefix is of no help in disambiguating the construction,
because, since it occupies the initial position, it must appear in the S/0
form regardless of whether it is functioning as A or 0.
The remaining combinations for first and second person all have dis­
tinct forms for A and 0 and, with a distinct form for S, (which is trans­
parently the bound form of the corresponding independent pronoun) ,
all exhibit a three-way split in their role marking schema. Only for the
second singular S form ma-, is there any difference from the independentTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS201pronoun, in this case mi 2SG. Transitive verbs involving these prefixes
are always unambiguous in their role indications.
(5-14) a. pu-ka-tay
3PL 0-1SG A-see
'I saw them.'
b. pu-IJa-tay
3PL A-1SG O-see
'They saw me.'
Finally, all third person prefixes operate on an ergative-absolutive role­
marking schema, conflating S and 0 and opposing this to the A form,
as in the following:
(5-15) a. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them.'
b. na-mpu-tay
3SG 0-3PL A-see
'They saw him.'
A curious anomaly in the Yimas paradigm of verbal pronominal pre­
fixes is the coincidence in form of the A prefix for second and third sin­
gular. This coincidence only applies in combinations of second singular
with third person, for in combinations with first person, other consid­
erations are operative, as we shall see below. But this coincidence does
create ambiguity in a number of verbal forms as seen in the examples
below.
(5-16) a. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-2/3 SG A-see
'You/he saw them.'
b. na-n-tay
3SG 0-2/3SG A-see
'You/he saw him.'
A similar problem of ambiguity afflicts the 0 prefix for second singular.
Notice that its form nan- is homophonous with the A prefix for second
plural, so that again verbal forms involving third person participants are
ambiguous.
(5-17) a. pu-nan-tay
3PL A-3SG O-see
'They saw you.'
b. pu-nan-tay
3PL 0-2PL A-see
'You all saw them.'","[214, 215, 216, 217]"
"202BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYIf the combination of participants is third singular A and second singular
0, the prefix na- functioning as A may be optionally deleted, resulting
in homophony with (5-16b) and a further ambiguity.
(5-18) a. na-nan-tay
3SG A-2SG O-see
'He saw you.'
b. 0-nan-tay
3SG A-2SG O-see
'He saw you.'
c. na-n-tay = (5-16b)
3SG 0-2/3SG A-see
'You/he saw him.'
I should point out that there are ways to disambiguate most of these
forms either by the use of independent pronouns or by nominalizing
them. See the discussion of finite nominalizations in Section 7.2.
It is now necessary to turn to the major principles which determine
the linear order of the A and 0 prefixes on transitive verbs. There are
two, sometimes conflicting, principles involved here. The first is a person
hierarchy in which first person outranks second which outranks third.
The second is a role hierarchy which states that for first and second
persons 0 outranks A, but for third person, A outranks 0.
Let us start with the simplest case, a verb with two third person
participants. In such a case, the first principle is irrelevant, for there
is no difference in person. Because both participants are third person,
by the second principle the higher ranked prefix will be the A. Rank is
indicated in the Yimas verb by a position to the right, closer to the verb
stem. Thus, for a verb with two third person participants, the 0 will
occur first and be followed by the higher ranked A, as in these examples:
(5-19) a. pu-n-tay
3PL 0-3SG A-see
'He saw them. '
b. na-mpi-tay
3SG A-3DL A-see
'They two saw him.'
In (5-19a) the A is third singular and the 0 third plural, so the prefixes
must occur in the order 0-A or pu-n- 3PL 0-3SG A. Similarly, in (5-19b)
there is a third dual A and a third singular 0, and again the prefixes
must occur in the order 0-A or na-mpi- 3SG 0-3DL A.
So far, all third person participants we have considered have referred
to humans, that is, members of noun classes I and II. One may have
in fact noted that the S/0 prefixes given for third person correspondTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR C ORE NOMINALS203to the verbal agreement prefixes for classes I and II. These two are in
fact one and the same. But the vast majority of potential third person
participants, the nouns of Yimas, refer to animals, plants or inanimate
objects. These too may be marked on the verb by the corresponding
verbal prefixes for noun classes given in Chapter 4. Like the prefixes
for classes I and II, these verbal prefixes are the forms used to mark S
and 0.
p-na-apica-mpi-irm-n
(5-20) a. tampaym
food hanger VII SG VII SG 8-DEF-hang-SEQ-stand-PRES
'The food hanger is hanging up.'
b. tampaym
p-ka-apica-t
food hanger VII SG VII SG 0-lSG A-hang-PERF
'I hung up the food hanger. '
(5-20a) contains an intransitive verb for which tampaym 'food hanger'
functions as the S nominal and is marked on the verb by the correspond­
ing class VII verbal prefix p-. (5-20b) illustrates the corresponding tran­
sitive verb for which the same nominal now functions as the 0 argument,
but again it is indicated by the prefix p-. Thus, these verbal prefixes for
noun classes exhibit the same ergative-absolutive pattern found through­
out the forms for third person. Examples from other classes follow:
(5-21) a. wut ura-na-irm-kia-k
night night 8-DEF-stand-night-IRR
'It's getting dark.'
wa-ka-tar-wapi
b. wanwa
knife IX SG IX SG 0-lSG A-CAUS-sharp
'I sharpened the knife.'
c. mura!Jkl kla-ka-yamal
paddle VI DL VI DL 0- lSG A-carve
'I carved the two paddles.'
Only occasionally can an inanimate noun be referenced by an A pre­
fix. The A prefixes have no differentiation for noun class: all nouns
regardless of noun class are indicated by one of the three A prefixes for
t hird person given above. Inanimate nouns may be expressed by an A
prefix if they are associated with a transitive verb indicating a change of
state or location, and they function as the force or instrument causing
the change. For example:
pu-n-kra-t
( 5-22) al
machete V SG 3PL 0-3SG A-cut-PERF
'The machete cut them.'","[217, 218, 219]"
"5Basic Verbal MorphologyThe verb is by far the most morphologically complex word class in Yi­
mas. Much of this complexity derives from elaborate processes of deriva­
tion and root compounding which will be the focus of the next chapter.
In this chapter I will discuss what would in traditional terms be described
as verbal inflection, although as we shall see, a sharp line between ver­
bal inflection and verbal derivation is very difficult to draw in Yimas.
Specifically, this chapter will deal with the inflectional system for tense,
aspect, and mood, as well as the pronominal affixes for the core argu­
ments. Because Yimas lacks any case marking on nominals functioning
as core arguments, these pronominal affixes serve as the primary device
signalling grammatical relations in the language. Since the pronominal
affixes can cause allomorphic variation in the tense/aspect/mood sys­
tem, I will begin with them. As the exposition will demonstrate, the
inflection of Yimas verbs with pronominal affixes is very complex. The
possibilities are summarized in Tables 5-7 at the end of Section 5.1.3.
5.1 The Pronominal Affix System for Core Nominals
5.1.1 The Basic Schema for Role Marking
As mentioned above, it is the verbal pronominal affixes on a Yimas verb
which indicate the semantic roles of its associated core nominals. These
function like case marking in languages like Latin or Sanskrit or word
order in languages like English or Indonesian. Consider the following
two examples:
narmaiJ
na-mpu-tay
( !""1- l) a. payum
man I PL woman II SG 3SG 0-3PL A-see
'The men saw the woman. '
b. payum

amakapapa:ukraipa2 m1kapwapa:ukraipwa3 m-/nampikrampumi- 2SG will, of course, cause palatalization of the initial /n/, so that the
combination will appear as m-pa 2SG-POSS. These possessive pronouns
are always bound to na POSS as prefixes. It is na which carries word
stress ( ama-na [AmA-na] lSG-POSS). Examples of these follow:

In the third person singular, the language makes a distinction between
what might be called proximative and obviative pronouns. The proxi­
mative form m- (the near distal deictic stem) is used when the possessor
is coreferential with a core argument in the clause, generally the subject,
while obviative na- is used when it is not.

'He bought his (someone else's) betelnut.'
This contrast is only found in the singular; to get the same distinction
in the other numbers, the normal possessor form must be modified by
the adjective ma 'other' to express unambiguously the non-coreferential
reading. Otherwise, the form remains ambiguous.

The latter construction, it must be admitted, was obtained only by
elicitation; I have never heard it used spontaneously. The speaker was
content to live with the ambiguity of ( 4-59a).
4.6 Nominals and Noun PhrasesFrom some of the above examples the alert reader will have noted two
constructions for possessor-possessed relations, illustrated again in the
following examples.

lSG POSS-V SG betelnut V SG
'my betelnut'NOMINALS AND NOUN PHRASES181Superficially these two constructions only differ formally in the pres­
ence or absence of the possessive agreement suffix -kn, but syntactically
there is a world of difference between them. The construction without
the possessive agreement suffix for the noun class and number of the
possessed noun is a tightly knit noun phrase. Its word order is rigid and
nothing may intervene between the two constituents.
(4-61) a.*matn
ama-na
brother I SG lSG-POSS
b.*ama-na mpa-n matn

However, neither of these prohibitions apply to the construction with
the agreement suffix.

b. ama-na-kn

In fact, when the possessor is suffixed with an agreement marker, any
word order is possible.

"YIMAS AS A POLYSYNTHETIC LANGUAGE279These sentences are nearly synonymous, and both are regarded as gram­
matical by native speakers. (There may be a subtle semantic difference
between them equivalent to 'He turned and came toward her' (6-2a) ver­
sus 'He turned toward her and came (toward her) ' (6-2b), but all speak­
ers queried regarded them as practically equivalent. Note that while
the two English sentences above have different structures and might be
said to have different meanings, they clearly can denote the same event.)
The formal difference between the two examples in (6-2) concerns the
placement of the allative valence increasing prefix ira- 'toward, because
of' (see Section 6.2.3.3.3). It is this prefix which sanctions the 0 prefix
na- 3SG 0 for this complex which only contains two intransitive verbs,
way- 'turn' and ya- 'come'. Note that regardless of whether ira- ALL
is placed immediately before ya- (6-3a) or precedes both verb roots (63b), it still licenses the appearance of na- 3SG 0 at the beginning of the
whole verb, demonstrating its integrity as a single grammatical word.
A final argument in favor of the analysis of the complex expressions
in ( 6-1 ) as single words concerns the behavior of modifying forms such as
those for aspect, modality, and mood. Note that the aspectual marker
nanav- DUR modifies both verbs in (6-1b) , as does the negative prefix
in (6-1c). This latter does not mean * 'again those few did not see her,
but they again came back'. This principle also applies to the scope of
mampi 'again' in this example: it modifies both verbs. In the text from
which (6-1c) is drawn, the expression describes the second time in which
someone who has fallen out of a canoe is ignored and the people paddled
on. Thus, the intended interpretation: ""Again those few did not see her
and again those few did not come back (for her).""
These arguments establish fairly conclusively that the constructions
in ( 6-1) are best analyzed as single words. Thus, Yimas is a polysynthetic
language. There is a very strong tendency throughout Yimas grammar
to reduce complex expressions to single words, as befits its polysynthetic
status. In the above examples, clauses and even complex sentences are
realized as single words. This tendency also finds articulation in the
system of nominals, discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.6. As pointed out,
Yimas productively forms compounds with two nouns, the head noun
to the right and the other suffixed with the oblique suffix - n ""' - nan.
(6-3) a. num-n
numpram
village-OBL pig III SG
'a domesticated pig'
b. p!Jkmp-n yaw
guts-OBL road IX SG

namarawt
magic X SG-OBL person I SG
'magician'
d. purkmp-n
yaw
bladder VI SG-OBL road IX SG
'urethra'
These nominal compounds are further examples of this polysynthetic
tendency to reduce complex expressions to single words. That these
form single words is indicated by the fact that they may serve as the
head of possessive constructions,
(6-4) [ama-na
[num-un
numpram]]
1SG-POSS village-OBL pig III SG
'my domesticated pig'
while true noun phrases may not.
(6-5) * [ama-na
[kpa [numpran]]]
1SG-POSS big pig III SG
These same constraints apply to the tightly knit noun phrases con­
sisting of a modifier plus a noun discussed in Section 4.6. In many ways
these too behave as single words. For example, the oblique suffix may
occur only once, on the head noun,
(6-6) a. [rna
kay]-Jlan
other canoe VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe'
*
b. ma-nan
kay-Jlan
other-OBL canoe VIII SG-OBL
while in the loose, scrambling type of nominal constituents, it may occur
on both modifier and noun.
(6-7) kay-Jlan
ma-y-Jlan
canoe VIII SG-OBL other- VIII SG-OBL
'in another canoe.'
The moral of this discussion of Yimas as a polysynthetic language is
that Yimas is one language in which the distinction between the gram­
matical levels of word and phrase is hazy at best and perhaps non­
existent. (In the next chapter we shall see that a similar haziness applies
to the border between clause and sentence.) Basically, it is the genius of
Yimas to employ many grammatical devices in a conspiracy to reduce
phrase-level units to word-level ones. This is closely related to the fact
that Yimas is syntactically a very flat language (see Hale 1983; Blake
1983): that is, the basic relations in Yimas syntactic constructions are
syntagmatic, forms following forms in linear sequence, rather than in aSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES281hierarchical arrangement. We shall see many examples of this property
in the next two chapters. One of the results of this resistance to hierar­
chy is that phrase-level structures are formally rather like words. Thus,
instead of [black[dog]), in which the hierarchical structure is indicated by
the level of bracketing, the Yimas equivalent is rather more like [black­
dog] , in which the components are syntagmatically related on the same
level.
Returning now to the examples in (6-1), it will be noted that I have
marked off a sequence of morphemes in each example by enclosing them
within brackets. This simply sets off the verbal morphology discussed
in the previous chapter from the rest of the verb whose structure will
be discussed in this chapter. A verb is made up of the basic verbal
morphology already presented, which corresponds to the verb periphery
and what I will term the verb theme. Verb themes may themselves be
complex, composed at least of one verb stem plus a set of optional verbal
affixes and incorporated adverbials. For example, in (6-la) the verb
theme is composed of the verb stem takat- 'touch' plus the prefixes pay­
'first' and ma- 'in'. The verb theme of (6-lc) is composed of two verb
stems taympi- 'see' and waraca- 'return' plus the incorporated adverbial
mampi- 'again' . A verb stem is in turn composed of no more than one
verb root plus optional derivational affixes. In (6- le), the verb stem is
composed of the verb root kulanav 'walk' and the derivational affixes
tav- COM and tal- CAUS.
The last chapter dealt with the basic verbal morphology of pronomi­
nal affixes: tense, aspect, modality, and mood. These categories form the
basis of the verb periphery and correspond to the morphemes which oc­
cur outside the verb theme, those morphological categories which apply
to it as a whole. In this chapter ,I will be concerned with the morphol­
ogy internal to the verb theme, that complex verbal morphology which
is particularly indicative of Yimas as a polysynthetic language. Because
this morphology is so complex, it is necessary to proceed from the basic
units and build up the morphological structure of the theme, brick by
brick. Thus, we start with the structure of the verb stem and its con­
struction from a verb root and, more specifically, with the question of
the transitivity of Yimas verbs.
6.2 Stem Derivational Processes
6.2.1 The Concept of Transitivity
Yimas is a language in which it is very important to make a clear dis­
tinction between the syntactic-semantic notion of the valence of a verb
and the formal morphological idea of transitivity. Very often there is a
mismatch between these two concepts, much more so than in more fa-282THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREmiliar languages like English. In Yimas, transitivity is defined formally,
by the number of overt pronominal affixes present: an intransitive verb
has no more than one pronominal affix, a transitive verb has two, and
a ditransitive verb has three. Valence, on the other hand, is a lexical
feature of verbs, either basic verb roots or derived verb stems and verb
themes. Verbs with one associated core argument are monovalent, those
with two are bivalent and those with three are trivalent. Yimas neither
allows verbs with more than three pronominal prefixes nor possesses
verbs, either basic or derived, with more than three core arguments.
In English and many other languages, there is generally a straight­
forward correspondence between transitivity and valence: monovalent
verbs are intransitive, bivalent verbs are transitive, and trivalent verbs
are ditransitive. This is not always transparently so in Yimas. First of
all, as pointed out in Section 5.1.6, overt pronominal affixes are not oblig­
atory, but are linked to pragmatic functions like givenness, etc. Hence
it is not unusual for a trivalent verb like va- 'give' to appear as an in­
transitive or simple transitive verb, with only one or two pronominal
prefixes.
(6-8) m-n
patn
ka-ua-ua-n
NR DIST-1 SG betelnut V SG LIKE-lSG D-give-PRES
'He will give me betelnut.'
Or a bivalent verb like wampaki 'throw' can be used intransitively with
only a single pronominal affix.
(6-9) nmpi
ay-cra-wampak-Jla-ukt
leaf VII PL HORT PL-around-throw-IMP-PC
'Let us few distribute letters.'
Examples like these were discussed earlier in Section 5.1.6, and it was
claimed there that they present cases of zero pronominal affixes. With
this analysis, the valence and transitivity of these verbs are in a one­
to-one correspondence; this is simply disguised by the zero pronominal
prefixes. By virtue of the completeness constraint, zero pronominal pre­
fixes are, of course, directly linked to core nominal arguments such as
patn 'betelnut' or nmpi 'leaves', so that all argument slots of these verbs
are in fact filled.
More problematic are common cases like those below, in which a
verb is marked with more pronominal prefixes than are called for by its
valence.
(6-10) a. ta-mp-ant-kia-k-nak-mpwi
NEG-3 DL A-hear-NIGHT-IRR-3 SG D-talk T
'Those two did not listen to her.'","[294, 295, 296, 297, 298]"
"THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS229As the A prefix is plural, the plural vaykum 'women' is linked to it and
interpreted as the A. The singular D prefix then links to the singular
noun panmal 'man' which assumes a D participant relation. Note that
if there was no number distinction between these two nouns, the clause
would be ambiguous.
(5-66) :uaykum
makaw
payum
woman II PL fish (sp) IX SG man I PL
wa-mpu-:ua-r-mpun
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'The men gave the women makau.'
'The women gave the men makau. '
As mentioned previously, the word order among noun phrases is free, so
that it does not play a role in disambiguating this clause. Taken out of
context, it must remain ambiguous.
It must be emphasized again that it is the pronominal affixes which
fill the argument positions of the verb, not the noun phrases, and these
latter only receive a participant role interpretation by being in a parat­
actic relationship with a pronominal affix of the same categorical speci­
fications. Given this fact, it is not surprising that in the large majority
of Yimas clauses in ongoing discourse, there are no independent noun
phrases at all. The participant roles are simply filled by the pronominal
affixes; so the following then correspond to (5-65a,b) :
( 5-67) a. ya-mpu-yamal-wat
VIII PL 0-3PL A-carve-HAB
'They usually carve them.'
b. wa-mpu-:ua-r-akn
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3PL D
'They gave it to them. '
These Yimas verbs would be used in contexts very similar to those of
their English clausal translations: when the referents of the pronomi­
nal affixes had been established in the discourse or context. The noun
phrases are suppressed and their referents tracked simply by the pronom­
inal affixes in Yimas, as the pronouns do in English. However, because
of the difference in grammatical status between the Yimas pronominal
affixes and the English pronouns, and because of the great range of dis­
tinctions made in its affixes, through the systems of noun class, person,
and number, Yimas allows much greater latitude in this feature than
English. For example, in some recitations of traditional legends, impor­
tant props and characters are not introduced through overt nouns, but
only with pronominal affixes. It seems to be assumed that the story line230BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYand characters are so familiar and well known that that is all that is
necessary. Also, the established, old information status of a participant
may persist much longer in Yimas discourse than in English. For exam­
ple, in the Yimas creation legend, there is an important prop which is
introduced and then ignored for a reasonably long stretch of discourse,
about 3 pages; it is then reintroduced, but only through the use of its
corresponding pronominal prefix! This is because, being class VII dual,
a relatively rare combination, there is no chance of confusion with any
other referent. English with its undifferentiated it is too impoverished
morphologically to allow this kind of free pronominalization over such a
long stretch of discourse.
An interesting difference between Yimas and English in this area
concerns translation strategies. I have very often been surprised by the
frequency with which Yimas speakers reference a participant simply by
a pronominal prefix when asked to translate a sentence from Tok Pisin.
For example, when asking for a translation of the Tok Pisin version of
'I bought betelnut', one may very well get:
(5-68) na-ka-wayk-t
V SG 0- lSG A-buy-PERF
'I bought it'
in which na- V SG 0 is the only overt indication of the class V singular
noun patn 'betelnut'. I have made no study of this, but I conjecture that
if English speakers were asked to translate the same Tok Pisin sentence
into English it is highly unlikely the noun would be omitted. I believe
this again reflects the basic difference between these pronominal affixes
and English pronouns: the pronominal affixes fill the argument slots of
the verb, and a clause is complete with just them. The noun phrases
are indirectly and paratactically linked to the verb through these affixes.
They may be omitted freely if they correspond to established referents.
On the other hand, in English the noun phrases themselves, whether
they be nouns or pronouns, fill these argument slots of the verb. So in
parroting back a clause in translation, it is straightforward and expected
that the speaker will simply repeat the nouns of the prompt sentence,
given that the noun phrase positions of an English clause must be filled
if it is to be complete.
An additional argument for regarding the affixes as filling the verbal
argument positions concerns the indication of paucal number. Paucal
number is predominantly a verbal category; with the exception of the
pronouns and deictics for humans, no noun phrases exhibit overt inflec­
tion for paucal, i.e., the plural number covers the range of paucal as well.
Consider the following example:THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS231(5-69) namat
patn
na-!Jkl-wayk-t
men I PL betelnut V SG V SG 0-3PC A-buy-PERF
'The few men bought betelnut. '
Assuming that the pronominal affixes fill the argument positions, this
example is easy to analyze. The A prefix vkl- 3PL A is third person
and paucal. Searching for a noun phrase which shares these features
we come across the class I plural noun namat 'men'. Knowing that the
equation paucal = plural holds for all nouns, we conclude that namat
'men' is linked to vkl- 3PL A, and it is interpreted to function in the A
role.
Now consider an analysis with the opposite assumption: that the
noun phrases really fill argument slots of the verb and the pronominal
affixes are just automatic copies of these onto the verb. Example (569) now becomes problematic because namat is morphologically plural
and should therefore be copied by the plural A prefix, mpu-. One could
argue, of course, that namat is actually specified as paucal, and that it
just happens that paucal and plural are homophonous. But this seeming
harmless coincidence happens throughout the language: no Yimas noun
distinguishes paucal from plural number. This analysis requires us to
posit a morphological category for Yimas nouns which never has any
overt realization for them. The previous analysis, with the pronominal
prefixes only filling argument positions, has no such requirement and is
therefore to be preferred.
Still another piece of evidence concerns verbal pronominal prefixes
with conjoint reference. Consider this example:
impa-wa-ntut
( 5-70) panmal
narma!J
man I SG woman II SG 3DL S-go-RM PAST
'The man and woman went . '
I have already presented arguments that Yimas does not permit nounphrases composed of conjoined nouns in Section 4.6. Hence panmal
'man' and narmav 'woman' cannot form a constituent in this example
to trigger the dual number specification for the S prefix on the verb
impa- 3 DL S. Rather this is specified independently and fills the S ar­
p;ument position for this verb. This is then linked to both singular nouns
paratactically, integrating both of them to fill out the dual specification
of the S prefix.
A final argument concerns the phenomenon of possessor raising to
he discussed in detail in Section 6.2.3.2. In this construction, a human
possessor of a core argument of the verb is promoted to function in its
own right as a core argument marked by a D affix.","[244, 245, 246, 247]"
"If the object is third-person and the subject first- or second-person,
they will again appear in that order, but the subject will additionally
be expressed by a suffix.
na-n-ti-ka-ndupa-m·ti-ka-nde3SG 0-2-hit·PRES·2PL A3PL 0·1-hit-PR.ES-1 PL A'You all are hitting him.'·we are hitting them.'",[48]
"INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS412suffix on the main verb. This is typical of negative oblique clauses. The
non-finite oblique clauses are within the same time frame as the main
clause and express events whose non-occurrence right now is responsible
for the circumstances holding in the main clause. Thus, in (7-75a) the
speaker's decision not to return is contingent on whether the women
come or not. If they do not come, the situation of the main clause will
eventuate. Similar remarks apply to (7-75c ). The middle example (775b) is perhaps the most interesting. The failure of the plane to arrive
will leave the speaker and his group without food. This situation is thus
summed up in the query which forms the main clause, 'what do we eat?'.
An interesting difference between positive and negative non-finite
oblique clauses concerns word order possibilities. While core arguments
of positive non-finite oblique clauses can occur after the verb, as exam­
ples (7-70b,e) demonstrate, this is not possible with negative non-finite
oblique clauses. So (7-76) is ungrammatical.
(7-76) *ya-kakan-0-nan
balus
ipa wara
come-without-V SG-OBL airplane V SG 1PL what
ipa-na-am-n
1PL S-DEF eat-P RES
This may indicate that -kakan 'without', like kantk 'with', is a postpo­
sition and governs an NP constituent preceding, blocking any possible
extraction from it.
-7.2 Finite NominalizationsFinite nominalizations contrast with non-finite ones in that they require
a tense suffix and never take -ru NFN. Pronominal affixes may also occur
on verbs in finite nominalizations. Another typical morphological feature
of finite nominalizations, albeit not a universal one, is the near distal
deictic stem m-. The verbs of finite nominalizations commonly occur
suffixed to this stem, replacing the normal class and number concord
suffixes, with the whole forming a complex nominal not unlike m-n NR
DIST-1 SG 'he'. The use of distal deictics to mark relative clauses is
common in Papuan languages (Reesink 1987; Olson 1981) and elsewhere
(note English that). In most languages, this occurs at the boundary of
the relative clause, but in Yimas it is a form bound, like a prefix, to the
inflected verb of the relative clause. This again reflects the polysynthetic
nature of the language; a relative clause will commonly consist of nothing
but a fully inflected verb, suffixed to m- NR DIST. A clause is again
realized as a word-level unit. Finite nominalizations have a similar range
of functions to their non-finite counterparts, except that they are neverFINITE NOMINALIZATIONS413used as complements. Their most common functions are as relative and
oblique (i.e., adverbial) clauses.
7.2.1 Finite Relative Clauses
Finite relative clauses are not an infrequent feature of Yimas discourse.
The verbs in finite relative clauses share a good deal in their morpho­
logical formation with modally inflected verbs, the discussion of which
the reader may care to review (see Section 5.2.2). Finite relative clauses
are typically marked by m- NR DIST, to which the fully inflected verb
is suffixed. (There is a sub-type of finite relative clauses which does not
employ m- NR DIST, and this will be discussed in detail later in this
section.) The stem m- NR DIST functions much like the wh word or
that in English-to mark the whole relative clause as a definite referring
expression. The other obligatory morpheme marking a finite relative is
a class and number concord suffix. These are the adjectival concord suf­
fixes for the various noun classes and occur as the final suffix of the verb,
except that human nouns do not distinguish class, i.e., masculine and
feminine nouns take the same set of suffixes, those found with modally
inflected verbs (see Section 5.2.2).
(7-77) a. krayu

'the frog which I killed'
[m-ua-tay-nc-u]
c. krayu
frog VI SG NR DIST-lSG 0-see-PRES-VI SG
'the frog watching me'
The suffix -'T)k VI SG (-1) in word final position) occurs on each of the
verbs in these relative clauses, marking the class and number of these
nominalizations and hence indicating what noun is modified by them,
i.e., what are their head nouns. The same class and number concord
suffix is used regardless of the participant role of the relativized noun: S
in (7-77a), 0 in (7-77b), and A in (7-77c). This is typical of lower animate
and inanimate nouns, but higher animate and especially human nouns
are more complicated. It will be necessary to discuss relativization on
the differing participant role types separately.
The basic rule is that the noun which is being relativized is marked
only once, by the final class and number concord suffix. The relativized
noun may be defined as the noun coreferential to the 'head', but obli­
gatorily absent in the relative clause. Thus, in all three examples in414INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-77) the relativized noun is krayv 'frog', the same as the 'head', but
it is obligatorily absent in these relative clauses and only traced by the
concord suffix agreeing with it in number and class. Relative clauses in
which the relativized noun functions as S are the simplest case, so let's
start there. The only agreement suffix permitted on a verb in a relative
clause with the S as the relativized noun is the final concord suffix; the
S cannot be also coded by a pronominal prefix. Consider these:
(7-78) a. namarawt [m-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-come-PERF-3SG
b.*namarawt [m-n-ya-t-0]
person I SG NR DIST-3SG S-come-PERF-3SG
'the person who came'
The relativized noun in both of these is the S participant, namarawt
'person'. This is, of course, the same as the head noun, and is marked
by the concord suffix 0. (Human singular nouns and singular nouns of
classes III and V are irregular in that instead of the expected concord
suffix -n, a zero morpheme is found. This is parallel to the usage with
modally inflected verbs.) Example (7-78b) is ungrammatical because
the S is coded twice on the verb, once by the concord suffix and also
by the pronominal agreement prefix n- 3SG S. The latter is completely
prohibited by the blanket rule against double marking of the relativized
noun.
When the relativized noun is an A argument, the resulting structure
is similar to that with relativization on an S. The verb can contain
pronominal agreement prefixes in addition to the obligatory concord
suffix, but these must code an 0 or D participant, never the A. The
morphology for marking a relativized A is identical to that for S.

person is first or second: third person prefixes are prohibited. So (7-80a)
is grammatical, but (7-80b) is not.
(7-80) a. namat

'the people who hit me'
[m-pu-tpul-c-um]
b.*namat
person I PL NR DIST-3PL O-hit-PERF-3PL
'the people who hit them'
The reason for this restriction is probably to eliminate ambiguity. Be­
cause the third person pronominal prefixes do not actually distinguish
participant roles as do those of the first and second persons, but vary
in form according to their word position, a form like (7-80b) would be
ambiguous as to whether pu- codes A or 0. In fact, a string like (7-80b)
can only have the meaning where pu- functions as the A.
When the relativized noun is 0, pronominal agreement prefixes of any
person are permitted on the verb to code the A participant. Consider
these examples:
(7-81) a. napntuk [m-kay-JlanaJJ-tmi-aw!Jkcpa-ntuk-ulJ]

NR DIST-3DL A-DUR-pound sago-RM PAST-IV PL
'the sago palms which they both were pounding'
Singular human nouns (and nouns of class III and V which behave
morpho- logically like them) have a special concord suffix - nak used
when the relativized noun is in 0 function.
(7-82) a. [Macprak m-n-wu-ntuk-nak]

m-mpu-tu-r-ak]

b. wakn

'the snake which the people killed'
This is the only concord suffix for relative clauses that actually codes the
participant role of the relativized noun. All others are oblivious to this.","[427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"
"BOUNDARIES AND THE NOTION OF THE WORD83Example (b) corresponds to (a) as negative to positive. Note that the
pronominal prefix p- in (a) appears as the corresponding suffix - m in
the negative example (b), as a result of its position being usurped by
the initial negative prefix ta-. Thus, we define the string flanked on
both sides by these affixes as a word, using the behavior of negation as
a grammatical criterion for determining words.
Unfortunately, this grammatical criterion is often at odds with pho­
nological ones. Consider this example with an incorporated nominal (S
marks the subject of an intransitive verb):
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n
(2-23) mamam
sore VII SG VII SG S-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The sore is getting smaller.'
waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG is a derived nominal incorporated into the
verb and forming a grammatical unit with it (see Section 6.2.3. 1.3). This
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that when rule (2-23) is negated, the
usurped pronominal prefix p- becomes the suffix -m at the end of the
word, following the tense suffix -nt PRES.
(2-24) a. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-ti-nt-m
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES-VII SG S
'The sore isn't getting smaller.'
*
b. mamam
sore VII SG
ta-na-waca-k-m-m-ti-n
NEG-DEF-small-IRR-VII SG-VII SG S-become-PRES
Other pieces of evidence that this is a single grammatical word are
the behavior of valence-increasing prefixes. For example, if a causative
is derived from (2-23), the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- can precede the
incorporated nominal.
mamam
(2-25) marasin
medicine V SG sore VII SG
p-n-na-tar-waca-k-m-ti-n
VII SG 0-3SG A-DEF-CAUS-small-IRR-VII SG-become-PRES
'The medicine made the sore smaller.'
The whole sequence waca-k-m-ti- small-IRR-VII SG-become 'become
small' is causativized by tar- CAUS, again demonstrating that it func­
tions as a grammatical unit.
While the verbs in (2-23) and (2-24) are single words by grammatical
criteria, they are not so on phonological grounds. Consider the incor-84PHONOLOGYporated nominal waca-k-m small-IRR-VII SG again. Note that the class
and number concord marker appears as the word final allomorph - m
and not the word medial (and underlying) form -mp. This indicates a
word boundary between - m and the verb ti- 'become'. Stress patterns
also indicate two words, as the stress pattern for the verb in (2-23) is
p-na-waca-k-m-U-n, with both waca-k-n and ti- being assigned stress
independently (remember as discussed above, the pronominal prefixes
are unstressed and ignored by the stress rules when assigning stress) .
So on phonological criteria, the word would be represented as I# p­
na-waca-k-m # ti-n #I, while on grammatical criteria it would be I#
p-na-waca-k-m-ti-n #I. Clearly, this is contradictory, and in order to
solve this dilemma, it is necessary to appeal to two different notions of
word, a phonological word and a grammatical word. With the earlier
discussion of nouns and adjectives, this was not necessary, as the two
criteria types coincided (although in treating noun compounds a similar
distinction would need to be invoked in English as well as Yimas; see
Di Sciullo and Williams 1987) . But with verbs, this distinction is clearly
needed. Phonological words are those word units defined by phonological
criteria, while grammatical words are those determined by grammatical
criteria. Units defined as words in Yimas by the segmental phonological
rules and stress rules are phonological words; I will henceforth use the
word boundary symbol to indicate the boundaries of phonological words.
Sequences which behave as integrated units with respect to grammatical
processes like valence changing and negative (among others) are gram­
matical words. The boundaries of grammatical words have no special
symbol. Rather, I will use the practical orthography to indicate these.
Sequences of verbal morphemes that I write as single words correspond
to grammatical words (they may, of course, also correspond to phono­
logical words), and the sub-word morphological units will be set off from
each other by hyphens.
Another interesting example of the contrast between phonological
and grammatical words involves the very common Yimas construction
of verb compounding or serialization, in which two or more verb roots
join to form a complex verb, as seen in examples such as these:
(2-26) a. urauknut

ura-mpu-ntak-mpi-]la-ntut

'They left the coconut meat.'

V PL 0-3PL A-split-SEQ-break-SEQ-tie-PERF
'They split the branches, broke (them) and tied ( them) .'
Each of these verbs corresponds to more than one phonological word,
as shown by the number of primary stresses marked in each example.
Yet they each clearly correspond to one grammatical word. First of all,
negation applies to the verb as a whole, demoting the first pronominal
prefix to the end of the full sequence of morphemes.

ta-mpu-park-mpi-kapik-mpi-wark-ra
NEG-3PL A-split-SEQ-break-SEQ-tie-V PL 0
'They didn't split the branches, break ( them) and tie

Further, valence increasing also applies to the verb compound as a whole.
Consider the examples above in ( 2-26 ) in combination with tav- COM,
indicating an action done for the benefit of someone present ( see Section
6.2.3.3 ) .

Interestingly, it is in the area of compounds where nouns also show
a split between the phonological and grammatical word, albeit not as
extreme as that for the verbs. Yimas has a productive system of noun
eompounding employing the oblique ease suffix on the first member of
the compound, rather like the use of the genitive ease in German noun
compounds.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"

"204BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYHere al 'machete' functions as the instrument responsible for the cutting.
There is no responsible agent mentioned in the sentence, so it is the
instrument which is coded by the A prefix. Note that although the 0
is animate and the A inanimate, the A still occurs closer to the verb
stem, in the higher ranking position. Now consider the following two
examples:
kay

water VIII SG 0-3PL A-CAUS-heavy-PERF canoe VIII SG
'The water made the canoe heavy. '
b. ikn
antki
smoke V SG thatch VII PL
ya-n-tar-urkpwica-t
VII PL 0-3SG A-CADS-blacken-PERF
'The smoke blackened the roof (thatch) .'
It is worth pointing out that arm 'water', which constitutes a noun
class by itself and is normally referenced by an S/0 verbal prefix ima-,
is treated as a plural noun when an A argument and indicated by the
third plural A prefix mpu-. In both examples, the verbs are overtly
causative, as expressed by the causative prefix tar- ""' tal- (see Section
6.2.3.1.3), and the inanimate nouns which express the forces functioning
as the causes are referenced by the corresponding A prefix. While con­
structions like those of (5-23) are certainly grammatical in Yimas, such
constructions with an overtly causativized verb have an alternative in
which the verb is intransitive and associated with an S argument express­
ing the entity undergoing the change of state and an oblique noun for the
causing force. So compare the examples in (5-23) to the corresponding
intransitive examples in (5-24) :
(5-24) a. arm-n
kay
i-cJJknt-t
water-OBL canoe VIII SG VIII SG S-heavy-PERF
'The canoe got heavy from the water.'
b. ikn-an
antki
ya-urkpwica-t
smoke-OBL thatch VII PL VII PL S-blacken-PERF
'The roof (sago thatch) blackened from the smoke.'
These later constructions obviate the need to code the inanimate causers
with an A prefix, instead marking them as peripheral nouns with the
oblique suffix. The constructions of both (5-23) and (5-24) are equally
grammatical and there is no significant meaning difference between
them, although perhaps the examples (5-23) , in which the causing func­
tions are marked as A, reflect a more direct causation, focusing on theTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS205causer, rather than the change of state. This seems to be true of the
corresponding English translations.
Having now discussed in some detail verbs associated with two third
person participants, let me turn to the next most straightforward cases,
those with one third person participant and one first or second person
participant. According to principle one, the first or second person par­
ticipant outranks the third person, so it must occupy the position closer
to the verb stem. Now the second principle must be considered: A out­
ranks 0 for third person, but 0 outranks A for first and second. So if
the A is third person and the 0 is first or second, there is no conflict
between the two principles: the first or second person 0 will occupy the
ranking position closer to the verb stem, and the third person A will
precede it.

3SG A-lPL O-see
'He saw us. '
p-ua-kra-t
d . naukm
grass VII SG VII SG A- lSG 0-cut-PERF
'The grass cut me.'
Note that because of the constraints on the form of the third person
prefixes imposed by linear order, the third person A's in these examples
actually appear in the form for S and 0, the only permissible form for
initial position. Also, because the A prefix must occur initially in an
S /0 form, it is now possible to indicate the noun class of inanimate
A 's as in (5-25d). This is not possible for verbs with two third person
participants, in which the A prefix must be the A form in the ranking
H«'cond position (5-23) .
If the A is first or second person and the 0 third person, the two
principles for ranking are now in conflict with each other. In this situ­
ation, principle one provides, and the first or second person participant
occupies the higher ranked position, even though it is an A (compare
t.lwse with examples in (5-25)) :
( fJ-26) a . pu-ka-tay

3DL 0-2DL A-see
'You two saw them two.'
c. na-kay-cay
3SG 0-lPL A-see
'We saw him. '
Now let us turn to the most complex cases, verbs with a first person
participant and a second person participant. By principle one, the first
person participant, will always outrank the second. But principle two
poses a potential dilemma. Remember that for first and second persons
0 outranks A, so that if the first person participant is the 0 and the
second person the A, there is no problem: both principles select the
same participant, the first person 0, as the higher ranked. If, on the
other hand, the first person participant is the A and the second person
the 0, the two principles are in conflict: principle one selects the first
person A as the higher ranked, while principle two chooses the second
person 0. As we shall see below, Yimas has evolved a clever solution to
this dilemma.
Let us start with the simpler of the two cases, that in which the
principles are in harmony. These involve a first person 0 and a second
person A. By both principles the higher ranked will be the first person
0, and therefore the prefix for this participant will occur closer to the
verb stem:
( 5-27) a. ma-IJa-tay
2SG A-lSG O-see
'You saw me. '
b . ma-kra-tay
2SG A-lPL O-see
'You saw us.'
c. kapwa-IJkra-tay
2DL A-lDL O-see
'You two saw us two.'
d. ipwa-IJkra-tay
2PL A-lDL O-see
'You all saw us two.'
Because the second person A is the lower ranked participant, it would
have to appear in the verb-initial position. But as we have seen with
third person prefixes, there is a constraint which prohibits the A prefix
forms from appearing there. Hence, the second person A is actually real­
ized with the S prefix form, as with the third person examples discussed
earlier. For example, in ( 5-27a,b) , the second singular A is marked byTHE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS207the prefix ma- 2SG S. The same constraint causes the S prefixes for non­
singular second person participants to be employed in examples (5-27c,
d), although in these cases it is a little more difficult to be sure that
there are in fact bound S prefixes, for they are completely homophonous
with the independent pronouns. Evidence that there are in fact bound
prefixes will be presented below in Section 5.1.4 on paucal marking and
again in Section 5.2.2.1 on negation.
Let us now look at the case in which the two principles fixing the lin­
ear order of A and 0 prefixes are in conflict, those involving a first person
A and a second person 0. By principle one, the first person A should
be the higher ranked, but by principle two, the second person 0 should
be. For a second person singular 0, the language avoids the problem en­
tirely by having a suppletive portmanteau morpheme mpan- ""' kampan­
(whose allomorph occurs word-initially) which is used whenever a first
person A of any number acts on a second singular 0.
(5-28) a. kampan-tay
1A/2SG O-see
'I saw you.'
b. kapa kampan-tay
lDL 1A/2SG O-see
'We two saw you.'
c. ipa kampan-tay
lPL 1A/2SG O-see
'We saw you.'
To distinguish the number of the first person A, an independent pronoun
must be used, as in (5-28b, c). Without a pronoun, first singular is
assumed, unless context determines otherwise (5-28a).
If the second person 0 is non-singular, the language copes by simply
prohibiting both participants from being realized as bound prefixes to
the verb. The second person 0 occupies the ranking position of the prefix
to the verb, and the first person A must appear as an independent pro­
noun. These independent pronouns are, of course, again homophonous
with the corresponding S prefixes (as with the examples of the non­
H ingular second person A's in (5-27c, d), but in this situation the first
JH�rson A's are flatly prohibited from being bound to the verb).

"FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS437As mentioned above, these oblique finite clauses have a fairly wide se­
mantic range to cover, corresponding to all types of English subordinate
clauses except manner clauses. The semantic contrast between English
subordinating conjunctions like when and if is carried in Yimas by dif­
ferent choices of tense suffixes or modal prefixes, because Yimas lacks
subordinating conjunctions of any kind. I will discuss these semantic
differences in turn.
The simplest and most common usage of oblique finite clauses is
as temporal adverbial clauses. The temporal relationship between the
oblique clause and the main clause can be either simultaneous or se­
quential. However, finite oblique clauses with a simultaneous temporal
relationship to the main clause are quite unusual, for this is the proper
semantic domain of the non-finite oblique clauses (see Section 7.1.4).
They do occur, but only in a meaning of partial temporal overlap; com­
plete overlap requires the non-finite construction.

'While I was in Australia, some people broke into my
house and stole my belongings.'
In these examples there is only partial overlap between the actions of
the two clauses. In (7-127a), seeing will precede spearing, but of course,438INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSwill coincide partly with it. For ( 7-127b) , the act of buying tobacco will
occur sometime in the time span of being in the store, but the latter
will certainly extend beyond that. Similarly for ( 7-127c ) , my stay in
Australia had a much longer duration than the burglary of my house,
but did overlap with it. As the first two examples demonstrate, a finite
oblique clause in a simultaneous temporal relation can be marked with
the imperfective regardless of the tense of the main clause. This choice
shows relative tense, i.e., simultaneous with respect to the tense of the
main verb, which registers the actual absolute tense of the overall sen­
tence. In ( 7-127c ) , the verb of the oblique clause shows remote past,
the absolute tense, and is identical with that of the main verb. ( 7-127b)
is also interesting in that the scope of the imperative does not operate
over the oblique clause. This is universally the case: oblique clauses
are invariably declarative; no other illocutionary force specification is
possible for them. This is because they encode presupposed background
information ( Haiman 1978 ) .
It should be noted in the above examples that the finite oblique
clauses precede the main clause. This is generally the case because Yi­
mas discourse is highly iconic: the order of the clauses reflects the order
in the real world of the events described by the clause. Because finite
oblique clauses describe presupposed background information and be­
cause established presupposed information is generally temporally prior
in narratives to new asserted information, it follows then that the finite
oblique clauses should precede their main clauses. This constraint pre­
dictably is most rigid with finite oblique clauses in a sequential temporal
relation, e.g., those which express an event which is temporally prior to
that of the main event. Examples of these follow:

The verb root ant- 'hear' is a perception verb for which typically the

are in a different place. In (6- 143) the elevational prefix l- 'down' can
only be interpreted as indicating the location of the slit drum (the 0
participant) , not the perceivers.
Transitive verbs of motion where the A participant moves toward the
0 argument or where the 0 participant itself moves are parallel: it is
the location or the direction of movement of the 0 participant which is
coded by the elevational/ directional prefixes.

In (6-144a), the A participant moves toward the 0 participant, the po­
sition of which is specified by l- 'down' as below the point of origin for
the movement. Example (6-144b) illustrates the setting in motion of the
0 participant by an action of the A participant. Again, it is the direc­
tion of the 0 (in this case, many directions) which is expressed by the
elevational/directional prefix tra- 'about'. Finally, (6-144c) illustrates a
case where through the action of the A participant, the 0 participant
actually comes into being. Again, the directional prefix tra- 'about' in­
dicates the location of these created objects (0 participant) not that of
the creators (A participant) .
The final question to be addressed in this section is the placement
of elevational/directional inflections in the morphological derivation of
a verb. They have been treated here as morphemes added at the level
of the verb theme and this analysis works well for the great major­
ity of cases. For example, an elevational/directional prefix usuallyTHEME DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES351appears before a serial verb construction, just as with incorporated
adverbials.

1DL S-down-turn-SEQ-run-toward-NIGHT-IRR
'We turned around and ran down here. '
I n each example o f (6-145), an elevational/directional prefix precedes
a complex verb theme which is of a serial verb construction. And in
each case, the prefix actually semantically modifies the last verb root
in the serial construction, the one farthest removed from it. Clearly,
by these examples, elevationals/directionals must be analyzed as mor­
phemes added at the level of the verb theme, parallel to incorporated
adverbials.
However, there are problems with this claim, for there exist exam­
ples where the prefixes occur inside serial verb constructions, like stem
derivational affixes.

3PL A-1SG 0-say-up-go by water-toward-PERF
'He made me come upriver toward the village.'
These exceptions fall into two clearly defined types. In the first type,
the elevationalfdirectional follows the basic motion verbs wa- 'go' and
ya- 'come' joined in a serial construction by -ka SEQ, as illustrated in
(6-146a,b). It may be that serialization of these two verbs using -ka SEQ
iH a later stage in the derivation, itRelf a derivation at the verb theme352THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTURElevel. In other words, in (6- 146b) a complex verb theme is first com­
posed by serializing the verb root ta- 'put' and the verb stem tantaw­
'sit down'. To this verb theme is then added the directional prefix ma­
'in' . Finally, this complex theme is then serialized again at the theme
level with ya- 'come' to form the final complex serial verb construction.
This analysis finds some plausibility in that it is strictly lexically gov­
erned by the two basic motion verbs; it needs to be stipulated as an
option restricted to these verbs in the grammar. This construction how­
ever, is only optional and is not obligatory as example (6-145a) clearly
demonstrates, for there kaw- 'inside' precedes ya- 'come' + -ka SEQ in
a serial construction.
The second two examples illustrate the other type of exception, which
involves the verb roots, vka- 'go by land' and impu- 'go by water'. These
exceptions are explained by the fact that the elevational/directional pre­
fixes are probably already associated lexically with these verb roots, so
that the prefix plus root should be regarded as a single verb stem. This
explanation is immediately confirmed by the observation that it is pos­
sible to use two elevational/directional prefixes with these verbs, one
before the root and joined at the stem level, and one at the level of the
verb theme, preceding the serial verb construction.

Having established that the elevational/ directional prefixes are mor­

ordering constraints with the other morphemes added at this level, in­
corporated adverbials. Although these morphemes function at the same
level their sequential order is rigid; the adverbial must precede the ele­

"AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF YIMAS VERBAL MORPHOLOGY3536.4 An Explicit Account of Yimas Verbal Morphology
In the last chapter and the previous sections of this chapter, I have pre­
sented a detailed discussion of the structure and categories of Yimas
verbal morphology. Within the verb, I have distinguished three levels of
structure: root, stem, and theme, and I have shown how the morphemes
of these three levels interact. I have also attempted a fairly careful de­
scription of the meanings and functions of the morphemes in the various
morphological categories, such as tense suffixes, pronominal affixes and
valence altering affixes, etc. In this section, I will try to draw all this
together and present a fairly explicit and coherent account of Yimas
verbal morphology.
Perhaps the primary bifurcation in the Yimas verb is that reflected
in the division of material between this chapter and the previous one.
This is the split between the categories within the verb theme, e.g. , ad­
verbials, serialized verbs, valence altering affixes, and those outside of
it, e.g., pronominal affixes, aspect, tense, and mood. In more traditional
terms, this corresponds. to the difference between derivational and inflec­
tional morphology, respectively. Derivational morphology is normally
described as that belonging properly to the lexicon, generating a new
complex form from a simplex base form, while inflectional morphology is
held to belong to the clause as a whole, specifying semantic and syntac­
tic categories at this level. Derivational morphology is usually optional,
while some categories of inflectional morphology in a language are of­
ten obligatory. While this distinction can be drawn in Yimas (as I just
did above), I do not believe it is of any great value in the description
of the language. I believe that ultimately all of the verbal morphology
in Yimas is produced as the result of derivational processes. There is
no sudden switch in the structural behavior of the verbal morphology
when one passes from inside of the verb theme to outside, so there are
no motivated grounds for drawing a distinction between two types of
morphology at this boundary. Rather the whole structure of a Yimas
verb is the result of ordered processes of morphological derivation, as I
will demonstrate below.
But before proceeding to this, let me first dispose of the argument
that the verbal morphology should be produced via syntactic rules. I
cannot consider all classes of morphology here, so let me consider what
might be the most promising cases-valence altering. There are a cou­
ple of compelling arguments for treating valence changing as a lexical
derivation process and not a case of a syntactic rule. First, note that
although Yimas has numerous productive valence increasing affixes, the
final output of these derivations can never be more than a trivalent verb
stem, the maximum permitted for underived verb roots like va- 'give' or354THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREi- 'tell'. In other words, the result of the valence increasing rules must
be the equivalent of the valence of a base lexical item. This constraint
makes sense if the valence increasing rules occur in the lexicon, but does
not if they are independent syntactic processes.
Now let me consider the second argument. Remember, as noted in
earlier sections, that valence increasing prefixes may have alternate con­
structions involving postpositions, as in the following examples, repeated
from previous sections.( 6-150) a. ipa kantk pu-mampi-wa-k
1PL with 3PL S-again-go-IRR

'He turned back and came toward her.'
b. na-n-way-mpi-ira-ya-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-turn-SEQ-ALL-come-RM PAST
'He turned back and came toward her.'
In the ( a) examples, a participant in the event appears as an oblique
phrase, while in the ( b ) examples, it is a core argument. Thus, oblique
nominals marked by the postpositions kantk 'with' and nampan 'toward'
correspond to core nominals coded by the valence increasing prefixes tav­
COM or ira- ALL, respectively. From the structural alternations and the
paraphrase equivalences between the ( a) and (b ) examples above, one
may conclude that there is a convincing case for a productive syntactic
process in Yimas which promotes oblique nominals to core arguments,
much as dative shift constructions are commonly analyzed in English:
he gave a book to Mary becomes he gave Mary a book.
This analysis, however, runs into immediate problems when we con­
sider the entire range of valence increasing affixes in Yimas. For most
of these, unlike tav- COM and ira- ALL, there is simply no alternative
construction in which the core argument licensed by the valence increas­
ing prefix appears as an oblique nominal. In other words, there are no
paraphrase equivalents such as the ( a) examples in ( 6-150) and ( 6-151 )
for these examples:( 6-152 ) a. na-n-taukway-iray-Jlcut

3SG 0-3SG A-KIN-cry-toward-IRR
'He cried carrying her toward the village.'
The ideas behind the examples in (6-152) can only be expressed in this
way; alternatives with oblique nominals do not exist (although para­
phrases employing two clauses are possible). This casts grave doubt on
the productive syntactic analysis of valence increasing in Yimas. There
are no plausible underlying syntactic constructions from which the ex­
amples in (6-152) can be derived. Rather one must conclude that they
(and, by extension (6- 150b) and (6- 151b)) are base generated. Further,
because the sequence of valence affix plus verb root forms a single verb
stem, this base generation must be accomplished by morphological rules
and most likely accomplished in the lexicon.
Having established the morphological basis of such processes as va­
lence changing, it is now time to turn to a more detailed account of
the derivation of Yimas verb forms. This model of Yimas verbal mor­
phology means that the entire polysynthetic structure of a verb, with
all its elaborate morphological specifications, is produced by a complex,
ordered series of derivations. The morphological rules which accomplish
these derivations are located in a component of the lexicon. It will be the
task of the remainder of this section to elucidate explicitly the internal
structure of this derivational process in its various stages.
The starting point, of course, for all Yimas verbs is a verb root: these
are all entered separately in the lexicon. Let us represent a verb root
with the symbol Vo .
The next state is the derivation of verb stems from verb roots. The
verb stem is represented by V1. There are a number of processes which
derive verb stems, i.e., convert Yo to V 1 : reduplication, noun incorpora­
tion, and valence altering. These processes are themselves hierarchically
arranged. The most basic, i.e the one applied first, is reduplication.
Reduplication seems to be the most lexicalized of all derivational pro­
cesses: there are two bits of evidence to support this. First, there is a
special dissimilation rule that applies to reduplicated forms that does
not apply elsewhere in the grammar (rule (2-7)) . This removes the F
autosegment from a reduplicated segment, so that wul- 'put in water'
reduplicated is wurt-, not *wult-. This is a specialized phonological rule,
something to be expected for a highly lexicalized process. Second, Yi­
mas has some irregular reduplicated forms: ira- 'dance' reduplicated is
iranta-, not *irata- . This, again, would be expected of a highly lexi­
ealized process. So, applying reduplication to two representative verb
roots, we have the following derivations:356

v1/ �REDREDVo\�a i'put in'/Vo\J/a k'break'arkarkapapiThis derivation can be stated as the lexical rule V 1 = (RED) + Vo .
The next stem-level derivational process is noun incorporation. As
mentioned in Section 6.2.5, this is a sporadic process which often re­
sults in idiomatic constructions, a feature diagnostic of a highly lexi­
calized process. The only productive type is incorporation of nominal­
ized adjectives. Diagrammatic examples of noun incorporation are given
below:

Combining reduplication and noun incorporation in one lexical rule, we
have V1 = (N) + (RED) + Vo .
Finally, we turn to the most common and most varied type of verb
stem derivation: valence alterations. All valence changing processes but
possessor raising and va- BEN are possible at the level of the verb stem.
A couple of examples illustrating valence changing inside serial verb
constructions (hence on the level of the verb stem) follow:
(6-155) a. na-n-way-mpi-ira-ya-ntut

'He turned and came toward her.'

b. tpwi
sago X PL X PL 0-3DL A-gather-KIN-ascend-NIGHT-IRR
'They both were gathering sago and carrying it up with
them.'
Valence altering affixes not uncommonly co-occur with the other two
derivational categories of the verb stem, reduplication and noun incor­
poration.","[368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"
"LOCATIONALS107Examples of these locational postpositions are given below:
pawmpn
'underneath' (trees)
'at the bottom, below' u rnkun
mawn
'above, at the top'
akpJlan
'behind'
wampuJlan
'in front of'
wampuun < wampu!J 'heart' + -n OBL
'inside'
tapukapn < tapukap 'outside' + -n OBL
'outside'
'outside' + -n OBL
'at the side of'
ayukn
< ayuk
Some of these are transparently derived from nouns by affixing the
oblique suffix. A few other locational words are still nouns because
they can be pluralized. Examples are kcpn 'space underneath a house',
PL: kcpnkat 'the spaces underneath houses'; and mawvkwat 'the other
side', PL: mawvkwara 'the spaces on or at the sides of a dwelling or
object'.
Although these looational postpositions most commonly occur in
postpositional phrases, they may also be used as free locationals. In
this sense, they are like English prepositions, as in John slept inside
versus John slept inside the house. So compare the following examples:
(3-27) a. akru
yampauk-n
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG head VI SG-OBL above VI SG-DEF-sit-PRES
' The frog is on top of (his) head.'
b. akru
mawn k-na-taw-n
frog VI SG above VI SG 8-DEF-sit-PRES
'The frog is on top.'
In the second example, the location which the frog is above is left unspec­
ified. It is either the position of some object inferred from the context
or may be taken to be the position of the speech event itself or some
event reported in the discourse.
Yimas has four other postpositions which may perhaps be treated
here and squeezed into the class of locationals, although they contrast
from those postpositions treated thus far in some important respects.
These postpositions are
nampan
'toward, for, because of'
nampayn
'like'
'toward, at the house/residence/property of (French chez ) ' naukun
kantk
' with, together'
These grammatical postpositions contrast with the locational postpo­
Hitions in that the preceding noun is never marked with the oblique
caHe suffix. Hence, these grammatical postpositions function like case108WORD CLASSESmarkers themselves, and this explains why they have more abstract re­
lational meanings in contrast to the concrete locational meanings of the
locational postpositions. Besides being postpositions, another feature
shared by members of both types is their ability to become specified
through prefixes to the verb. When this happens with a locational post­
position, the associated noun remains oblique, but with a grammatical
postposition, it becomes a core argument cross-referenced by a verbal
agreement prefix. Consider the following examples:
(3-28) a. panmal
numpk-n
mawn
man I SG mountain V SG-OBL above
na-na-taw-n
3SG S-DEF-sit-PRES
'The man is on top of the mountain.'
b. panmal
numpk-n
na-na-wi-caw-n
man-I SG mountain V SG-OBL 3SG 8-DEF-above-sit-PRES
'The man is on top on the mountain.'
(3-29) a. panmal IJaykum
kantk na-na-wa-n
man I SG woman-11 PL with 3SG-DEF-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
b. panmal IJaykum
pu-na-taiJ-wa-n
man I SG woman II PL 3PL 0-3SG A-DEF-COM-go-PRES
'The man is going with the women.'
In (3-28a) the oblique noun numpuk-n 'mountain' is followed by the
postposition, mawn 'above', while in (3-28b) the oblique noun occurs
by itself, and the notion of 'above' is expressed by the verbal elevational
prefix wi- 'above', which triggers palatization of the following /t/. (For
a detailed discussion of elevational prefixes, see Section 6.3.3.) Sentences
(3-28) (a) and (b) are not perfectly synonymous in all senses. (3-28a)
would normally be taken to mean 'the man is at the top of the mountain'.
Although the reading 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
on the mountain' is possible, it is definitely not preferred. (3-28b) has
the exact opposite ranking of preferred readings. It would normally
be taken to mean 'the man is above (us, where the speech act occurs)
somewhere on the mountain'. The reading 'the man is at the top of the
mountain' could only be a special case of the former reading, a discourse­
based inference. Thus, the structural difference between a locational
postposition and a verbal elevational prefix reflects a difference in the
preferential readings of the scope of ' above'. As a locational postposition,
it is primarily taken as a modifier of its oblique head noun, while as
a verbal elevational prefix, it is taken as a modifier of the verb and,TEMPORALS109more widely, the speech act. Note that this same contrast is carried in
English by the choice of the prepositions of versus on (see the English
translations of ( 3-28a, b)).
The examples (3-29a, b) are different in two respects. The noun
vaykum 'women' is not case marked by the oblique suffix, but is directly
followed by the postposition kantk 'with'. When the concept of 'with'
is expressed by the comitative verbal prefix tav-, naykum is necessar­
ily a core argument. This is demonstrated by its corresponding verbal
prefix pu-, which agrees with the noun in terms of number/class fea­
tures. (For a detailed discussion of the notion of core arguments and the
function of valence-increasing verbal affixes like tav- COM, see Section
6.2.3.3. These two examples also contrast with the previous two in that
they are absolutely synonymous. As far as can be determined, there
is no difference in sense whatsoever between (3-29) (a) and (b) . There
are pragmatic differences, however, concerning the contrastiveness of
vaykum 'women' (see Section 5.1.6).
In their true postpositional use, all four grammatical postpositions
require human (or at least higher animate) nouns or pronouns as their
objects. kantk has another adjectival-like use to express possession and
then is often found with inanimate object nouns, but that is not of
concern here (see Section 4.5) . nampan, navkun, and nampayn contrast
with kantk in that their objects, when pronouns, must be in the form
of the bound possessive prefixes (see Section 4.5). This is prohibited for
kantk, whose pronoun objects must be the free forms.

Temporals express the time setting of an action. Temporals are of two
types in Yimas, basic temporals and nouns metaphorically used as tem­
porals. Basic temporals are themselves of several types:General temporals:muntawktn
kal]kran
tampin
mpa'at first'
'before, early'
'after, later'
'now, already'Parts of the day:kratut
tumpntut
aJ]kayapan
wut'twilight' (5:00-6:00)
'morning' (6:00-9:00)
'late afternoon' ( 17:00-19:00)
'night' ( 19:00-5:00)WORO CLASSES1 10There is no specific word to refer to the main part of the day from about
9:00-17:00 hours. The general word tmal 'sun, day' can be used for
this period, and more specifically, the phrase kpa tmal 'big sun' can be
used for the middle, hottest part of the day. In parallel fashion, kpa
wut 'big night' can be used to refer to the period around midnight. In
addition speakers often use the Tok Pisin word belo 'noon' for the very
specific period between 12:00-13:00, when government offices are closed,
and people would have lunch in the towns.
Day counters:kwarkwa
IJarlJ
urakr!J
tnwant!J
kampraJlCIJ
manmaJlCIJ'today'
'one day removed'
(i.e., 'yesterday, tomorrow')
'two days removed'
'three days removed'
'four days removed'
'five days removed'Yimas has the interesting, but not unusual, Papuan system of reckoning
time from the point 'now' Janus-like in both directions, so that one day
in the past (yesterday) and one day in the future (tomorrow) are both
denoted by the same term varr). The actual time referred to by varr.J is
distinguished by the choice of tense on the verb, near past (yesterday)
versus near future (tomorrow) (see Section 5.2.1).
Yimas also has two basic nouns used metaphorically as temporals.
These nouns contrast with all previous temporals in that when they are
used as temporals, they must be suffixed with the oblique case suffix.
mlantrm-nan
moon, month V DL-OBL
'in two months'tmat-jlan
sun, day V SG-OBL
'during the day'They are, however, not the only temporals which some morphological
features of nouns. A few temporal words from all types except the
general temporals may form close-knit noun phrases with the adjective
ma- 'other' to mean 'on another ' Such noun phrases formed with the
temporal nouns or the words for parts of the day occur with the oblique
suffix.
_rna
tmat-jlan
other sun, day V SG-OBL
'on another day'.rna
wut(-Jlan)

'on another night'The oblique suffix is optional with wut, but required with tmal. 'l)arr.J
from the class of day counters also forms this construction, but is pro­
hibited from taking the oblique suffix.","[122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"

wayk-ru-mpwi pia-n-yaukurau-takal
b. patn
betelnut V SG buy-NFN-talk talk 0-3SG A-thought-feel
'He thought to buy betelnut.'
The formal difference between the ( a) and ( b) examples is simply the
absence versus presence of the prefix pia- 'talk' for the 0 argument.
This formal difference correlates with a consistent, albeit subtle, seman­
tic contrast. The (b) examples, with the prefix, express a situation in
which the A participant states verbally to some other participant that
he is going to carry the basket or get betelnut ( but in ( 7-34b) he sub­
sequently forgets to do so ) . The ( a) examples, without the prefix, do
not require that A state his intention verbally to someone else; he may
simply have the intention as an idea in his mind ( again ( 7-34a) indicates
that the intention slips his mind) . Note that the use of the pronom­
inal agreement prefix here very closely reflects its pragmatic function
with noun phrases generally. With the prefix, the intention expressed
by the complement has been stated explicitly; it is very much estab­
lished information in the context of the discourse. Without it, the com­
plement is simply an intention in the A participant's mind, and not
stated explicitly, and hence not clearly established information in the
discourse.
In the examples presented so far, the complements have always pre­
ceded the matrix verbs. This is probably the most common order, but
is by no means the only one. Complements can follow the matrix verb,
as in these examples:
( 7-36 ) a. pu-ua-tkam-t
patn
3PL A-lSG D-show-PERF betelnut V SG

Here, the complement verb consists of a verb theme formed by a serial
verb construction consisting of two verb roots, yara- 'pick up' and wul­
'put down'.
7.1.3 Purpose Clauses
Purpose clauses share a number of the grammatical properties of com­
plements, but contrast with the latter in that they never function as a
core argument of the matrix verb. Rather, they function somewhat like
oblique constituents of the matrix verb, expressing the intended goal of
the action of the matrix verb. Purpose clauses are like complements in
that they are non-finite: they never occur with pronominal agreement
affixes or true tense suffixes (only the irrealis suffix) . Purpose clauses are
always controlled: the A or S of a purpose clause can never be overtly
expressed and is always coreferential with a human core argument of the
matrix verb. Normally this is the S or A participant, but if the verb has
more than one human participant, it is possible for the 0 or D to be the
controller. ( See example ( 7-61c) below. ) The verb in a purpose clause
is marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' -vk, as in these examples:
( 7-61 ) a. rna IJarlJ
wa!Jkia
awl-k
other 1 day removed rafters IX PL get-IRR
ipa-wa-ntut
1PL S-go-RM PAST
'Next day we went to get (wood for) rafters.'
b. wut am-kia-k

kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-1SG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
taiJkway-cakal-k
VIS-grasp-IRR
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
In ( 7-61a,b) the matrix verbs are monovalent verbs of motion with only
an S participant, which is then the controller of the purpose clause. NoteNON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS403further the presence of -kia in both the matrix verb and that of the pur­
pose clause. Its presence on both verbs is obligatory. True complements
diverge here in prohibiting -kia. Example (7-61c) has a bivalent main
verb with two human arguments, an A, vaykum 'women', and an 0, va­
lSG 0. The controller of the purpose clause must be the 0 participant:
witness the above translation. (7-61c) cannot have A control (*'it was
the women who sent me so that they could look after the children').
The irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk is the general and common marker of
purpose clauses, but in one specific context there is an alternative to it.
If the act denoted by the purpose clause is to be carried out directly and
immediately as the result of a directive speech act, such as a request or
an order, then the marker for a complement of speech - mpwi 'talk' plus
the immediate aspect clitic mpan IMM may be used. Compare (7-62)
with (7-61c) above:
(7-62) !Jaykum
m-IJa-wampak-c-um
kumpwi
woman II PL NR DIST-lSG 0-throw-PERF-3PL child I PL
ta!Jkway-cakal-cu-mpwi mpan
IMM
VIS-grasp-NFN-talk
'It was the women who sent me to look after the children.'
Examples (7-61c) and (7-62) are very close in structure and meaning.
They structurally contrast in that (7-61c) has the irrealis suffix -k ,...., -vk
while (7-62) has the form of a complement with -ru NFN plus - mpwi
'talk' and the clitic mpan IMM. The meaning difference is that (7-62)
requires an immediately prior verbal order or request to someone that
they look after the children. This is not the case in (7-6lc); although
this scenario is possible, others are also, such as an arrangement made
days earlier or a pre-established custom that one does regularly. It
needs to be noted that not all speakers make this contrast. For some
speakers the contrast is one of immediacy; for them purpose clauses in
-mpwi mpan need to follow directly from the action of the matrix verb.
Other speakers seem to use the two ways of forming purpose clauses
interchangeably. And even some speakers who make it in some contexts
do not make it in others. It appears to be a semantic distinction well on
its way to being lost.
7.1.4 Non-Finite Relative Clauses
Yimas has two types of constructions corresponding to English relative
clauses. A relative clause is a clause-level construction (or more formally,
an S) which modifies a noun, such as the dog [which chased the cat] , in
which the relative clause which chased the cat modifies the noun dog ,
generally called the head of the relative clause. This relative clause404INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSis embedded as a constituent within the whole noun phrase, so that
the constituent structure is [the dog [which chased the cat]] . Both of
the Yimas relative clause types differ from English relative clauses in
that they are never embedded, but are simply nominalized forms of
verbs appositionally linked to a noun they modify, their 'head noun',
rather like juxtaposed possessive nominals. The two types of relative
clauses in Yimas contrast as to whether they are tensed or not. Non­
finite relative clauses are prohibited from occurring with tense suffixes
and instead have - ru NFN plus one of the set of suffixes which mark
agentive nominalizations (for head nouns referring to humans) or one
of the possessive/adjectival concord suffixes (for non-humans). Finite
relative clauses, which will be discussed in detail in Section 7.2.1, are
formed with or without the stem m- NR DIST, but require a true tense
suffix. This difference correlates closely with a meaning difference. Non­
finite relative clauses denote traits or characteristic actions of the noun
modified, while finite relative clauses denote states which hold or actions
which occur within the time frame denoted by the tense suffix on their
verbs. Consider this contrast in the following examples:
(7-63) a. namarawt [awt pampay-kulan-t-awt]
person I SG fire KIN-walk-NFN-M SG
'the person who tends the fire' (as his job)
b. namarawt [awt m-na-pampay-kulana:u]
person I SG fire NR DIST-DEF-KIN-walk
'the person who is tending the fire' (right now, others may
do so at other times)
The glosses in (7-63) clearly bring out the meaning contrast between the
non-finite (7-63a) and the finite (7-63b) relative clauses. The non-finite
relative clause expresses a long duration characteristic action, hence the
reading of the action as a job, while the finite relative clause denotes
the action as occurring within the time frame of the tense suffix, 'right
now', as the tense in (7-63b) is present imperfective. A similar contrast
can be found with states.
(7-64) a. namarawt [tamana
ti-r-awt]
na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG feel-NFN-M SG 3SG S-die
'The person who was always sick died.'
b. namarawt [tamana
kantk-n] na-mal
person I SG sickness IX SG with-I SG 3SG S-die
'The sick person died.'
The non-finite relative clause in (7-64a) denotes a typical characteristic
state. The copula anak COP 3SG has been deleted in (7-64b), leaving
just the postpositional phrase inflected with the concord suffix - n I SGNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS405as the finite relative clause (the copula could be inserted, but it is better
to omit it). Again, the finite relative clause is bounded in time, denoting
a temporary, transitory state of illness.
The syntax of non-finite and finite relative clauses is nearly identical
and because the latter are the more common type, I will discuss the
syntax of relative clauses in detail in Section 7.2.1. The one significant
difference between the two types is in the range of core argument posi­
tions which are relativizable (Keenan and Comrie 1977). The relativized
noun is that obligatorily missing argument of the relative clause which
must be coreferential with the noun modified, the 'head'. Any core ar­
guments plus locationals and temporals are relativizable with a finite
relative clause, but the relativized nouns in non-finite relative clauses
are restricted to S or A arguments. This is readily explicable, because
non-finite relative clauses are nothing but agentive nominalizations in
apposition to some nominal (the 'head noun'). Hence the noun which
they relativize must belong to the same general class as agentive nom­
inalizations, i.e., either S or A. Interestingly, as ( 7-65c) shows, it is
possible to use a non-finite relative clause to relativize a nominal which
is a non-agentive S. Examples of non-finite relative clause are provided
below:

c. mukawu yampara-t-uu
post X SG stand-NFN-X SG
ku-ka-pay-pu-t
X SG 0-lSG A-carry-away-PERF
'I took the post for standing up.'
A slight morphological peculiarity of non-finite relative clauses (one
they share with non-finite oblique clauses to be discussed in the next406INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSsection) concerns singular class III and V nouns functioning as 'heads'.
Instead of the expected concord suffix -n III/V SG in this case, what
is actually found is the agentive nominalization suffix - awt M SG, as in
this example:
(7-66) kakam
[awt yara-t-awt]
tree (sp) V SG fire pick up-NFN-M SG
'a (piece of kakam) wood for picking up fire'
Other inanimate nouns are regular, in that the proper concord suffixes
are used.
(7-67) awruk
[awt yara-t-u!J]
torch X SG fire pick up-NFN-X SG
'a torch for picking up fire'
In addition to the positive non-finite relative clauses exemplified thus
far, Yimas also possesses negative non-finite relative clauses, which ex­
press the lack of a state or characteristic action. These are formed with
the postposition - kakan 'without' which behaves morphologically like the
attributive kantk- 'with'. (See example (7-64b)), except that it uses the
agentive nominalization suffixes for human 'head' nouns. There is even
a further exception to this last generalization: for the singular of classes
I, III, and V, -kakan actually uses a zero morpheme, rather than either
the expected - awt M SG or - n I, III, V SG.) Consider these examples:
(7-68) a. wik

am-kakan-mat]
week V SG one-V SG tobacco eat-without-M PL
na-kay-caw-ntut

Both the (a) examples with kantk 'with' and the (b) examples with
tav- are grammatical, but the latter are the more common and greatly
preferred structure in all cases. This is in keeping with the general
polysynthetic character of Yimas. Given the choice between coding an
event as a clause or as a single word, the latter is generally chosen.
There appear to be no meaning differences between these two encodings,
beyond the fact that the (a) sentences are far more marked (i.e., much
less likely to be uttered spontaneously in a discourse).
Promotion of nominals by tav- applies to both monovalent and bi­
valent verb roots, but not to trivalent ones, because Yimas never allows
more than three core arguments to a verb. (6-53) and (6-54) illustrate
promotion with tav- applying to monovalent verb roots. In the (a)
examples of each, a pronominal appears as an oblique marked by the
postposition kantk 'with'. In the (b) examples, these pronominals are
now realized as core arguments, kra- lPL 0 and impa- 3DL 0 , as sanc­
tioned by the use of tav- . With derived bivalent verbs, the constituent
promoted by tav- is always coded by the 0 prefix form.
Examples (6-55) and (6-56) illustrate bivalent verbs derived into
trivalent ones by tav- . Again, in the (a) examples the pronominal is
marked with the postposition kantk 'with', but in the (b) examples it
is realized as a core argument through promotion by tav-. Note that
with derived trivalent verbs the promoted argument appears in a da­
tive affix form: va- lSG D and kra- lPL D. (6-55b) represents a two
step derivation. First, the monovalent activity verb root kwalca- 'rise'
is derived into a bivalent accomplishment causative verb stem by tar- ,.....,
tal- CAUS. This stem is then subject to derivation by tav- COM, which
converts it to a trivalent verb stem, licensing the appearance of va- lSG
D as a core argument. The ordering of the two prefixes in (6-55b) is free;
altering the sequence results in a grammatical sentence with exactly the
same meaning.

(6-56) illustrates tav- promotion applying at the level of the verb theme.
The verb theme here is complex, made up of two verb stems: ntak-( mpi-)
'leave, abandon' and nav- 'stay, live' (the final nasal of the stem disap­
pears by nasal truncation) . The prefix tav- immediately precedes ntak­
'leave', but it cannot be claimed that it semantically modifies only thisSTEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES305verb, for the wrong meaning would result: * 'they along with us left
those (pieces of coconut meat) which stayed'. Rather, it is clear that
tav- semantically belongs with the second verb nav- 'stay': 'they left
those (pieces of coconut meat), and those stayed with us'. The con­
struction in (6-56b) is the result of applying tav- promotion at the level
of the verb theme: it derives a trivalent verb theme from one which was
bivalent, composed of the verb compound ntak-mpi-nav leave-SEQ-stay,
i.e. , 'deposit'. Other examples with tav- follow:

As pointed out i n Section 4 . 5 and elsewhere, the relationship o f pos­
session is commonly predicated through the use of kantk- 'with' plus the
copula. In such constructions, possession thus is viewed as a comitative
relationship between the possessor and the possessed: they accompany
each other, and are in the same place and time. This construction
with kantk- 'with' is most commonly found with objects which may be
viewed as alienably possessed, that is, in which the possessive relation­
ship is not an essential, defining, and integral characteristic of possessor
and possessed, but rather a relatively transitory and shallow relationship
resulting from the vicissitudes of life events. The following are typical
examples of alienable possession:
(6-59) a. arm kantk-n amyak?
water with-1 SG COP 2SG
'Do you have kerosene?'
kantk-mampan aympak
b. tawra
money IX SG with-1 DL
COP 3DL
'Those two have money.'
I >ossession expressed through kantk- is also permitted (albeit rather rare)
with nouns which are inalienably possessed, such as body parts, names,
de. For these nouns, possession is an essential, defining characteristic
of their relation to their possessor, which is thereby a relatively perma­
nent relationship. Examples of inalienably possessed nouns with kantk­
follow:

"334THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREIt is important to note that although these two verbs have specialized
meanings in serial verb constructions, such readings are not obligatory.
Although they, of course, must have their literal meanings after -mpi
SEQ (6-110a) , this is also possible if they are joined simply by juxtapo­
sition (6-1 10b) .
(6- 110) a. na-mpu-wampaki-mpi-tay-k

'They threw it and watched it.'
b. impa-mpu-yakal-irm-tay-JlCUt
3DL 0-3PL A-CONT-stand-see-RM PAST
'They were standing up and watching those two.'
6.3.1.2 Specializations in Serial Verb Constructions:
ti- 'do, feel, become'
The verb root ti- 'do, feel, become' is used in serial verb constructions
in two specialized ways. In both these uses, it occurs as the first verb
in the serial structure and is only linked to the following verb by simple
juxtaposition. In the first of these uses, ti- 'do, feel, become' is always
employed in combination with the verbal prefix tia- 'act, deed' (or its
suffixal variant - nti) to emphasize that an action is accomplished to a
greater extent than is usually expected. This is most common with verbs
of motion, as these examples illustrate:
(6-111) a. tia-n-t-arm-mpi-wa-k
act 0-3SG A-do-board-SEQ-go-IRR
'He boarded (the canoe) and went for good.'
b. tia-kay-c-arpal-kiantu-JJkt
act 0-lPL A-do-exit-FR PAST-PC
'Those few came outside completely.'
c. tia-n-taJJ-ti-wa-kia-ntuk-nakn
act 0-3SG A-COM-do-go-NIGHT-RM PAST-3SG 0
'He went with her for good.'
Notice that, in some ways, ti- 'do, feel, become' functions in these exam­
ples as a valence increaser, to derive bivalent verb themes from mono­
valent verb roots of motion. It is treated here as a specialized use of
a serial verb construction rather than as a valence increasing prefix be­
cause it is completely restricted to a single introduced participant, coded
by the agreement prefix tia- 'act'. As this prefix is transparently related
to the semantics of the verb root ti- 'do, become, feel', it seems on bal­
ance more justified to treat this construction as a specialized serial verb
construction, although, I do admit, the boundary between specialized
serial verb constructions and, say, constructions with pampay- KIN isTHEME DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES335not a sharp one. The last example above (6-111c) is an interesting one.
Although the core lexical verb root wa- 'go' is monovalent, the whole
verbal construction is formally ditransitive. This is because serialization
with ti- 'do' derives a bivalent verb theme and requires the presence of
tia- 'act'. This in turn is derived into a trivalent verb theme by tav­
COM, which licenses the appearance of - nakn 3SG D.
Related to this first specialized use of ti- 'do, feel, become' is the
second one involving the interrogative adverbial waratnti 'how, in what
way' . Consider first the following example:
(6-112) takmpi tia-kay-JlanaJJ-ti-ntut
like this act 0-lPL A-DUR-do-RM PAST
'We used to do it like this.'
Since ti- 'do, feel, become' is a bivalent verb in this usage, it is associated
with two pronominal affixes: kay- lPL A and, filling the 0 slot, tia- 'act',
so (6-112) literally means 'we used to do the act like this' The interrog­
ative waratnti adverb contains the suffixal equivalent of tia- 'act' which
is -nti . When this interrogative word is used in a clause, it typically is
linked to the verb ti- 'do, feel, become', joined by juxtaposition as the
first member of a serial verb construction. The adverb waratnti 'how'
is formally a noun (it has the nominal concord suffix - nti 'act'), and is
regarded as a core argument (note that it has no oblique suffix). Just as
ti- 'do, feel, become' requires tia- 'act' in (6-111), it sanctions waratnti
in the examples below:
(6-113) a. waratnti tia-kay-JlanaJJ-ti-kra-ntut
how
act 0-lPL A-DUR-do-cut-RM PAST
'How did we used to cut (it)?'
b. waratnti anta-ti-kra-kia-na-IJ?

V PL 0-lSG A-DEF-do-down-get-SEQ-stub-NR FUT-IRR
'How am I getting (these) and stubbing (toes)?'
Although formally all the verbs in (6- 113) are transitive, matching
the bivalent specifications of their verb stems, they are actually trivalent,
for the third core argument is waratnti 'how'. This is possible because336THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREof the use of ti- 'do, feel, become' in all the above examples, which links
to waratnti 'how' in much the same way as it did to tia- in (6-112). This
is transparently the case in (6-113a) in which the prefix tia- is overtly
present and appositionally linked to waratnti.
6.3.2 Adverbial Incorporation
A second common process of derivation in Yimas which derives verb
themes from verb stems is adverbial incorporation. Yimas possesses
two types of adverbials: those which are base adverbials and can only
appear incorporated as part of the verb theme and those which are
derived from other word classes, notably adjectives and adverbs, and
normally can appear either as incorporated elements or as independent
words. As an example of the first type, consider pay- ' (at) first, right
now'. A sentence in which it appears as an incorporated element of the
verb theme (6-114a) is grammatical, but one in which it appears as an
independent word (6-114b) is not.
(6-114) a. na-mpu-pay-kulanaJJ-tay-Jlcut
V SG 0-3PL A-first-walk-see-RM PAST
'They walked around and looked at it first. '
b. * pay na-mpu-kulanalJ-tay-JlCut
first V SG 0-3PL A-walk-see-RM PAST
But mampi 'again' is a member of the second class. It is derived from the
adjective root ma- 'other' plus the adverb derivational suffix - mpi and
can appear either as incorporated element (6-115a) or as an independent
word (6-115b).
(6-115) a. na-n-mampi-ira-wampulJkra-ntut
3SG 0-3SG A-again-ALL-angry-RM PAST
'He was angry with her again. '
b . mampi na-n-ira-wampu1Jkra-ntut
again 3SG 0-3SG A-ALL-angry-RM PAST
'He was angry with her again. '
Obligatorily incorporated adverbials commonly, but not exclusively, ex­
press aspectual or temporal notions, while optionally incorporated ad­
verbials denote the manner in or degree to which an action is carried
out. I will first take up the discussion of the former.
6.3.2.1 Obligatorily Incorporated Adverbials
6.3.2.1.1 Continuative yakal-. This morpheme and the next one to be
discussed are the most common of incorporated adverbials. The con­
tinuative yakal- (sometimes contracted to kal-) expresses that an action
or event continues uninterrupted over an extended period and is trans­
latable by the Tok Pisin usage i wok long. It is commonly found inTHEME DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES337combination with verbs denoting actions. It may only be used in past
and future tenses; in the present, its function is usurped by na- DEF +
-nt PRES.
Examples of yakal- follow:
(6-116) a. impa-yakal-cmi-kiantut
3DL S-CONT-say-FR PAST
'Those two were talking. '
b. na-mpi-yakal-ca-mpi-yampara-pu-k
V SG 0-3DL A-CONT-put up-SEQ-erect-away-IRR
'Those two were putting it up and erecting it while going.'
c. pu-n-yakal-calJkway-cantaw-malak-ntut
3PL 0-3SG A-CONT-VIS-sit(RED: taw-)-converse-RM PAST
tak
here
'He was sitting here, talking with them to their faces. '
The position of incorporated adverbials is fixed. The obligatory incor­
poration of adverbials always occurs at the level of the verb theme and,
thus, follows the derivation of a complex verb theme through verb seri­
alization (6-116b) or valence altering (6-1 15c) . Any other order of the
morphemes in (6-1 16b,c) is ungrammatical.
6.3.2.1.2 Durative nanav-. This morpheme expresses an event or, more
commonly, a state which endures over an uninterrupted span of time.
In contrast to yakal- CONT, nanav- DUR is more commonly associated
with verbs denoting states or conditions, and is typically translated by
the Tok Pisin preverbal particle se HAB. Verbs marked by nanav- DUR
are typically viewed as extending over a longer period of time than those
with yakal- CONT, hence the correlation of nanav- with the Tok Pisin
habitual particle. It is transparently related to the verb nav- 'live, stay'
by partial reduplication, but the meaning is now quite divergent, and
it must be regarded as a separate morpheme. A relationship between
stance verbs like 'stay' or 'sit' and a durativefprogressive morpheme is
a common feature of Papuan languages (Foley 1986) . The adverbial
nanav- DUR is also commonly found in combination with the aspectual
suffix -na( v) DUR (see Section 5.2.1.6.2) .
Examples of nanav DUR are:
na-nanalJ-yamat-jla-ntut
(6-117) a. kay
canoe VIII SG 3SG S-DUR-carve-DUR-RM PAST
'He was making a canoe.'","[349, 350, 351, 352, 353]"
"STEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES293This example comes from a text in which a slain brother will make a
flood come to drown the inhabitants of the village as revenge. This is
done through magic, which requires both actions and words. Note that
tal- is the morpheme used. It may also be possible to argue that events
accomplished through magic are properly viewed as done by physical
action, for, in the Yimas world view, magic is a force raised and brought
to bear by a magician's skillful use of ritual. This force may operate
through the intermediary of malevolent spirits raised by the magician.
So far I have presented bivalent causative accomplishment verb stems
derived from monovalent achievement verb roots (examples in Section
6.2.3. 1.2 and example (6-28a) above) and monovalent activity verb roots
(examples in (6-27) , (6-28b,c), (6-29a), and (6-31)). The only monova­
lent verb root class not yet treated is that of states. States belong to
two different word classes in Yimas: verbs and the small closed class of
true adjectives. Both may be causativized.
The true adjectives denote states in their basic root meaning. In
order to be causativized, first inchoative forms are derived, which are
in turn causativized with the causative prefix tar- ""' tal-. First, con­
sider some examples of adjectives used as predicates, i.e. , in equational
sentences.
(6-32) a. ma!Jka!Jkl kpa-JJkl
aklak
arm VI DL big-VI DL COP VI DL
' (His) arms are big.'
b. kumpwi yua-y
aykk
boy I PL good-1 PL COP I PL
'The boys are good.'
These equational constructions are actually composed of two noun
phrases, connected optionally by the copula. Note that the adjectives
must be suffixed with the proper adjective agreement suffix, converting
them to nominals (see Section 4.6).
Inchoative achievement verbs are derived from the true adjectives
nsing the general verb ti- 'do, feel, become'. Contrast the following with
the stative examples in (6-32) :
( 6-33) a . ma!Jka!Jkl kla-kpa-!Jkl-ti-ntuk-nakn
arm VI DL VI DL S-big-VI PL-become-RM PAST-3SG D
'His arms became big.'
b. mpa kumpwi i-]la-yua-y-ci-n
now boy I PL I PL S-DEF-good-1 PL-become-PRES
'Nowadays the boys are growing up well. '
Note that the adjective and ti- 'do, feel, become' together form a sin­
gle verbal stem. The adjective continues to take the proper agree-294THE VERB THEME AND CLAUSE STRUCTUREment suffix for the noun it modifies; hence this is properly a type of
noun incorporation (see Section 6.2.5). The pronominal affixes and the
tense/aspect/mood inflections are, as usual, affixes to the verb theme as
a whole. It should be pointed out that incorporation of the adjective is
not obligatory. Competing with the examples of (6-33) are (6-34) below:
(6-34) a. maJJkaJJkl kpa-JJkl
kla-ti-ntuk-nakn
arms VI DL big-VI DL VI DL S-become-RM PAST-3SG D
'Their arms became big.'
b. mpa kumpwi yua-y
i-Jla-ti-n
now boy I PL good-I PL I PL 8-DEF-become-PRES
'Nowadays the boys are growing up well. '
There is no discernible meaning difference between constructions with
the incorporated nominalized adjective and those without.
When constructions such as those in (6-33) are in turn causativized,
the causative prefix tar- ,...., tal- is employed, but there are a few options
as to its placement. The most common choice is to place it immediately
before ti- 'become'.
(6-35) a. irpm
coconut palm IV SG
mu-ka-kpa-m-tal-ci-t

b. kumpwi i-kay-yua-y-cal-ci-t
boy I PL I PL 0-lPL A-good-I PL-CAUS-become-PERF
'We raised the boys to be good.'
The prefix may also occur before the adjective (6-36a) or there may
be two occurrences of it, one before the adjective and one before ti­
'become' (6-36b):
(6-36) a. irpm

"446INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONS(7-136) kla-nti maa ya-nti
get-3SG DR come-3SG
'He 1 got (it) and he2 came.'
This constraint is not operative in many other Papuan languages. In
these other languages, dependent verbs are marked for switch refer­
ence, which monitors whether their subjects are the same or are dif­
ferent from that of the following verb, such as in these Kewa examples
(Franklin 1971):
(7-137) a. nf reko-a
agaa la-wa
1SG stand-SEQ talk say-1SG NR PAST
'I stood up and spoke.'
b. nf reka-no
agaa la-a
1SG stand-DR.1SG talk say-3SG NR PAST
'I stood up and he spoke.'
In (7-137a), the dependent verb reko- 'stand' has the same subject as the
following independent verb and so is simply suffixed with - a SEQ to mark
its temporal relationship. In (7-137b), the subjects of the independent
and dependent verb are different; hence the dependent verb receives the
suffix -no to indicate that its own subject is first singular, but that that
of the next verb will be different.
Dependent verbs in Yimas are always marked with - mpi SEQ and
express a sequential temporal relationship between it and the following
verb (those in a simultaneous relationship must use other constructions,
like non-finite oblique clauses). Normally, they take no other inflections
but - mpi SEQ, although it is possible for them to co-occur with -kia
NIGHT/NEAR and - k IRR. This is yet another example of the common
usage of -k IRR as a non-finite suffix. They take their specifications for
tense and mood from the following verb, but unlike the Iatmul exam­
ples above, it is not necessary that their S or A argument be corefer­
ential with that of the independent verb (there is no switch reference
system).
Consider these examples:
(7-138) a. kalakn !Jayuk
tay-mpi na-na-kuck-n

'The boy, having seen his mother, is happy.'

"STEM DERIVATIONAL PROCESSES295This last option is of questionable grammaticality, as it was obtained
only in elicitation. I will say no more about it. The difference between
(6-35a) and (6-36a) is in the order of derivation. In (6-35a) the causative
derivation applies to the stem. The monovalent achievement verb root
ti- 'become' is first derived to the bivalent causative verb stem by tar­
"""" tal- , and this in turn is joined with the adjective as an incorporated
nominal to form the final complex verb theme. This is in keeping with
the general pattern of valence-altering devices in Yimas, which derive
verb stems from verb roots. (6-36) has the opposite derivational order.
First, the adjective derived as a nominal by the proper agreement suffix
is joined with ti- 'become' to form a verb theme, which is a monova­
lent achievement predicate. This in turn is causativized by tar- """" tal-.
Both of the derivational paths are possible, although the first is strongly
preferred by most speakers. This is because valence-increasing in this
derivation applies at the level of the verb stem, rather than the verb
theme, which is the preferred option for this construction in Yimas.
As with the inchoative examples in (6-34), incorporation of the
nominalized adjective is not obligatory with these derived causatives.
Hence, alternating with the examples in (6-35) and (6-36) we have the
following:
(6-37) a. irpm
kpa-m
coconut palm IV SG big-IV SG
mu-ka-tal-ci-t
IV SG 0-lSG A-CADS-become-PERF
'I grew the coconut palm to be big. '
b. kumpwi yua-y
i-kay-cal-ci-t
boy I PL good-I PL I PL 0-lPL A-CADS-become-PERF
'We raised the boys to be good.'
Again, there is no meaning difference between these examples without
incorporation and the earlier ones with it.
Adjectival nouns such as tark 'coldness' and tamana 'sickness', used
in association with kantk- 'with', form inchoatives and causatives in
similar ways to true adjectives. The stative uses are also similar in that
they commonly employ the copula.

It should be noted that every form of the copula ends in -k. This is none
other than the irrealis suffix and is obligatory on the copula because the
statements in which it occurs are not bound in time. These statements
of identity or ascription of qualities are not held to a particular temporal
frame of reference, but are held to be true generally, or at least without
clearly defined temporal limits. If the statement is bound within some
statable temporal limits, then the verb ti- 'become, feel, do' must be
nsed with a tense suffix.

The Grammatical Status and Pragmatic Functions of the
Pronominal Affixes
! laving now expended a great deal of effort to understand the complexity
to which Yimas has elaborated its system of pronominal affixes, the
reader will probably be surprised to discover that they are not obligatory.
This is not to say that they are not very common; they certainly are.
The great majority of transitive verbs in discourse, for example, have
both an A and an 0 prefix attached to them. But the fact remains that
they are an option, and it is the purpose of this section to outline what
are the factors which determine these choices and, further, what is the
��;rammatical status of these affixes on verbs which contain them.
To borrow terminology from Bresnan and Mchombo (1987) , the Yi­
maH pronominal affixes are examples of pronominal agreement rather
than grammatical agreement. The idea behind this contrast is not new:
5 . 1 .6228BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYit is basically the analysis of Aztec that Wilhelm von Humboldt pre­
sented 1 50 years ago ( Humboldt 1836) . In essence, the claim is that the
pronominal affixes actually fill the argument positions of the verb and
that any noun phrases filling what seem to be the core argument posi­
tions of the verb are actually only indirectly linked to it, by being in ap­
position to a pronominal affix which bears the same noun class, person,
and number specifications as the noun phrase. Consider some examples:
( 5-65 ) a. kacmpt
payum
ya-mpu-yamal-wat
canoe VIII PL man I PL VIII PL 0-3PL A-carve-HAB
'The men usually carve the canoes. '
b . lJaykum
panmal
makaw
woman II PL fish ( sp) IX SG man I SG
wa-mpu-lJa-r-akn
IX SG T-3PL A-give-PERF-3SG D
'The women gave the man makau. '
The verb yamal 'carve' i s a simple transitive verb with two core argu­
ments, A and 0. The prefixes to the verb identify the A as third person
singular and the 0 as class VIII plural. As pointed out earlier, the A
prefixes do not normally distinguish noun class and are almost always
restricted to human nouns, or at least higher animates. Now the process­
ing task is to search for the noun phrases which have the same person,
number and class specifications as the verbal prefixes, so as to fill out the
interpretation of the clause. The class VIII plural noun kacmpt 'canoes'
has the same class and number specifications as the 0 prefix ya- VIII
PL; the nominal is therefore integrated with the prefix and interpreted
as carrying the 0 role. The human plural class I noun payum 'men' has
the same number specifications as the A prefix mpu- 3PL A. Being hu­
man, it is a potential A, unlike the other noun, and hence is interpreted
with the role of A in the clause. The two nouns are not themselves filling
argument positions in the verb; those are simply the pronominal affixes.
The nouns are, however, linked to these affixes by virtue of having the
same category specifications and through this indirect route are inter­
preted as having the same participant roles. The word order of the noun
phrases is free and plays no role in their interpretation.
Example ( 5-65b) is similar, but in this case the verb is ditransitive.
Its affixes indicate a class IX singular T ( wa- ) , a third plural A ( mpu-)
and a third singular D (- nakn) . The singular class IX noun makaw 'fish
( sp) ' is clearly linked to wa- and thereby receives the theme interpreta­
tion. The other two nouns, the class II plural vaykum 'women' and the
class I singular panmal 'man' are both human and hence both potentially
A and D. But the number contrast here is sufficient to disambiguate.","[242, 243, 244]"
"6The Verb Theme and Clause
Structure6.1 Yimas as a Polysynthetic Language
In this chapter and the next I will deal with what might be called the
'syntax' of Yimas. I put this word in quotes because to a very great
extent Yimas lacks the features that we take as diagnostic of syntax in
the more familiar languages of Western Europe. Other than the minimal
noun phrase discussed in Section 4 .6, the syntactic landscape of Yimas
strikes a speaker of a western European language as very alien territory
indeed, presenting very few analogues to the syntactic constituents we
have come to expect.
Like many Amerindian languages, Yimas may be described as poly­
synthetic. Boas ( 1911 , 74) defined this feature as follows: ""a large num­
ber of distinct ideas are amalgamated by grammatical processes and
form a single word, without any morphological distinction between the
formal elements in the sentence and the contents of the sentence."" In
other words, a word (especially a verbal word) in a polysynthetic lan­
!!;Uage corresponds in the range of distinct ideas expressed in it to what
is articulated by a sentence in more familiar languages. To see how this
applies to Yimas, consider the following examples (the square brack­
ds indicate the structural level of verb theme, which will be defined
later) :
( 6- 1) a. ka-mpu-[pay-ma-takat ]-.Jla-mpan-m

b. ya-mpu-[nanaiJ-tacay-ckam]-tuk-mpun

'They were showing those very carefully to them.'

'We few got up and quickly started to walk.'
e. na-n-[mampi-taJJ-tal-kulanalJ]
3SG 0-3SG A-again-COM-CAUS-walk
'He made him walk with him again. '
All of these examples constitute single words, yet are translated by
sentences in English, in some cases (6-lc,d) by quite complex sen­
tences. That these are single words is clearly supported by a num­
ber of facts. First, these sequences are fully coherent and are not
interruptible. For example, no word or phrase can come between
kwalca-mpi arise-SEQ and kulanav walk in (6- ld) , in spite of the fact
that, from the English point of view these would seem to be sepa­
rate words. Note that in the English translation, the adverb quickly
occurs between these two verbs; this is not possible in the Yimas
form.
Second, the verbal morphology discussed in detail in Chapter 5 ap­
plies to these verbal forms as a whole, not individually. Note that the
tense suffixes in the above forms occur only once, following the last verb
root. Further, the pronominal affixes which mark the core arguments
have scope over the whole complex. Thus, in (6-lb) the 0 and A argu­
ments are indicated by the initial prefixes and the D argument by the
final suffix. In (6-lc) the A argument is marked by the second prefix
vkl- 3PC A (immediately following ta- NEG), and the 0 argument by
the final suffix - nak 3SG. In the corresponding positive sentence, of
course, both the A and the 0 would be indicated by prefixes. Perhaps
the most striking case is the long example in (6-ld). Here the S argu­
ment is expressed by the initial prefix pavkra- lPC S, and its number is
again referenced by the final suffix -vkt PC, eight morphemes away!
Third, the ordering of morphemes within these complexes is rigid.
For example, in ( 6-la,e) any ordering of morphemes other than that
given will result in ungrammatical forms. In a very few cases alternative
orderings are possible, but with no appreciable difference in meaning.

'He turned back and came toward her.'","[292, 293, 294]"
"NON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS391There seems to be no meaning difference between the two orders,
complement-matrix or matrix-complement: they are interchangeable,
although the former is preferred. This flexibility, interestingly, also ap­
plies to nominals inside the complement. These too can be transposed
outside of the complement.

These sentences are generated by shifting a core argument of the comple­
ment outside of the embedded S. Note that the moved core arguments
of the embedded S are now coded as core arguments of the main verb,
by -ra V PL in ( 7-37) and na- V SG T in ( 7-38 ) . In other words both of
the movements in the following structure are acceptable:

core nominals associated with the matrix verb, but so can its shifted
core argument.
Consider the following examples:
(7-40) a. :uaykum
irut
ampa-t-wal
woman II PL mat IX PL weave-NFN-custom V SG

:uaykump-n

ampa-t-wal
weave-NFN-custom V SG
tia-mpu-na-tkam-t-mpun
act T-3PL A-DEF-show-PRES-3PL D
'The women are teaching the girls how to weave mats.'
The matrix verb in (7-40), being ditransitive, is linked to three nominal
arguments: the A, vaykum 'women', the D, vaykump-n kumpwi 'girls',
and the complement irut ampa-t-wal 'how to make mats' functioning
as T. The complement only has the single overt nominal argument,
irut 'mats', functioning as 0. The entire complement can appear be­
tween the other noun arguments of the matrix verb (7-40a) or following
them (7-40b). Further, the single noun argument of the complement,
irut 'mats', can appear among the arguments of the matrix verb, as
in (7-40c )
Perhaps the most salient morphological difference between matrix
and complement verbs, other than the suffix -ru NFN, is the use of
pronominal affixes with the former and their obligatory absence in the
latter. The lack of pronominal affixes for complement verbs is corre­
lated with restrictions on associated nominal arguments. An S or A
argument of a complement verb (the subject of the verb in the sense
of the term used in English grammar) cannot appear as a simple core
.","[406, 407, 408]"

Note that the verb root ti- 'do, become feel' is always used in combi­
nation with - nti 'act' in the verb of the manner clause. This function is
undoubtedly like that with waratnti 'how', to allow the suffix - nti 'act'
to code a core argument (see Section 6.3.1.2). As with temporal and lo­
cational relative clauses, these manner clauses are finite relative clauses
without external modified nouns, their only indication being the final
suffix - nti 'act'. The manner clause of (7-133d), for example, may be
more literally glossed as '(like) the act(s) which their fathers did build­
ing houses'. Although these manner clauses are oblique constituents
(they are manifestly not core arguments of the main clauses), they dif­
fer from all others in never being suffixed with -n - nan. This is
a unique feature of them. There is, however, an alternative construc­
tion available employing relative clauses without m- NR DIST and the
postposition nampayn 'like' which overtly marks the manner clause as
oblique.

""'CLAUSE CHAINING AND COORDINATION4457.3 Clause Chaining and CoordinationIn addition to the rich array of nominalized structures I have described
in the previous sections of this chapter, Yimas also possesses several
types of conjoined clause structures. One of these, clause chaining, is
very common in Papuan languages (Foley 1986, 175-98) and I will take
this up first.
7.3.1 Clause Chaining and Dependent Verbs
Clause chaining is accomplished in Papuan languages through the use of
dependent verbs. The difference between dependent verbs and serialized
verbs was discussed and illustrated in Section 6.3.1. To recapitulate, de­
pendent verbs are the predicates of full but dependent clauses, which
obligatorily take their specifications for tense and mood from the fol­
lowing fully inflected verbs of the independent clause. Consider these
examples from Iatmul of the middle Sepik River region (Staalsen 1972):(7-135) a. vi:-si:mpla ya-wi:n
see-SIM come-1SG
'I saw it while coming.'
b. vi:-laa ya-wi:n
see-SEQ come-1SG
'Having seen it, I came.'
The first of the verbs in these two examples is the dependent one, while
the second is independent. The independent verb is inflected for the
person/number of its S argument (- win 1SG), past tense (0), and declar­
ative mood (also 0). The dependent may have none of these inflections.
It simply takes a suffix -simpla SIM or - laa SEQ which indicates the
temporal relationship between it and the following independent verb.
Dependent clauses are not in a subordinate or embedded relationship
to the independent clause. The structural relationship is one of coor­
dination (see Foley and Van Valin 1984, 239-44), yet dependence. The
difference between chained dependent clauses and coordinated indepen­
dent clauses is simply that in the former the specifications for some
semantic features such as tense and mood are taken from the indepen­
dent clause, while in the latter the clauses are separately specified for
these same features.
Iatmul dependent verbs obligatorily take their specification for their
subjects (S or A argument) from the following independent verb. If the
subjects are different, two independent verbs in a coordinate structure
must be used.","[459, 460, 461]"

as they find their way in the modern worldPrefaceThis book is the result of a research project spread over some ten years
and funded largely by the Australian Research Grants Scheme (Grant
A176/15655) , with some supplementary funding in 1985 from the Fac­
ulties Research Fund of the Australian National University. The goal of
the project was a complete study of the Yimas language, its grammar
and lexicon, the social and cultural contexts of the use of the language,
its history and genetic relations, and its interactions with neighboring
languages. Some of the results of this project have been reported in pre­
vious works, notably Foley (1986, 1988), but this book represents the
most complete document on the language to date. Still to come are a
Yimas dictionary and a volume of traditional legends, presented in Yi­
mas with Tok Pisin and English translations. Further, the result of the
Yimas language project will play a central role in a long term research
project I have just commenced-a reconstruction of the prehistory of
the Sepik-Ramu basin, using largely linguistic data.
The following grammar is not written in any set theoretical frame­
work. I wanted the organization of the grammar to reflect the structure
of the language as closely as possible. Hence, I have deliberately chosen
to be eclectic, choosing various ideas from different theories when these
Heem to elucidate the structure of the language best. Thus, the reader
will find that the phonology is largely cast in an autosegmental frame­
work, while the syntax reflects a rather broad structuralist/functionalist
pmspective. Still, these frameworks are not rigidly adhered to, but are
adapted as needs be in order to make the grammar widely accessible.
This seemed to me to be the best approach, because this work is likely to
hP the only documentation ever of the grammar of the Yimas language,
and hence it is esset;1tial that it be intelligible to the widest possible au­
di«�nce. Those who find in the labyrinth of Yimas grammar, facts which
viiviiiPREFACEare confirmations (or disconfirmations! ) of their favorite linguistic hy­
potheses are welcome to make whatever use they like of this grammar
and restate it in whatever theoretical model they fancy.
This book is the last I will write at the Australian National Univer­
sity, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues
and the general staff of the University for their help and kindnesses over
the years, which have made my twelve years here such a pleasant time.
The conditions at the Australian National University must be among
the very best in the world, and whatever value the reader may find in
this work is due in no small part to the excellent support provided by
the University over the years.
For the completion of this work, I owe a great debt to several people.
The two most important are Mrs. Ellalene Seymour, who patiently and
uncomplainingly typed the manuscript from untidy handwritten drafts,
and Rosemary Butt, whose electronic wizardry made the correcting and
editing of the manuscript much less painful than it otherwise would have
been. Thanks also go to Val Lyons, who drew the maps.
Finally, a simple thanks is inadequate to express my debt to my main
language teacher Stephen Yakayapan Mambi and my other language
helpers at Yimas: Paul Api, Pius Taki, Marikin, Malkior Yumbwi, and
Bruno Yumbwi. It was their hard work and patience which made this
book possible. Finally, I hope the dedication of this book to the Yimas
people goes part of the way in repaying their kindness and trust in me
over the last ten years.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

'They cut my hair. '
ti- 'become, fell' is normally an intransitive verb, but in (5-71a) it has
two affixes, S and D; kra- 'cut' is a transitive verb, but in (5-71b) it has
three pronominal affixes, S, 0, and D. These D affixes mark fully core
arguments: whatever processes are available to D affixes on ditransitive
verbs are available to these as well, e.g., relativization, anaphoric control
over non-finite modifiers, etc. (see Chapter 7) . By assuming that the
pronominal affixes directly fill the core argument positions of the verb,
this is easily explicable. But otherwise it is not, for the nouns which
these affixes reference are only possessors of other core arguments, the
S in (5-71a) and the 0 in (5-71b). While these may be coded as core
arguments through the verbal prefixes, they may not appear as core
arguments in their own right:
(5-72) a.* wampu1J

b.* ama yampa1J

I
head VI SG VI SG 0-3PL A-cut-PERF
These examples are ungrammatical because these possessors may
not be treated as core (i.e., lacking the oblique suffix) unless linked to
a pronominal affix. The contrast in grammaticality between (5-71) and
(5-72) clearly demonstrates that it is the pronominal affixes which confer
core status and, in fact, fill the argument slots of a verb.
Thus far, I have been discussing referents which are old or established
information and can therefore be indicated by a pronominal affix. What
about new information, characters or props now just being introduced
in the discourse? These can appear with or without a pronominal affix
so that in essence we have the three following structural patterns:
Pattern 1 :
Pattern 2 :
Pattern 3:0
NP
NPPRO-verb
PRO-verb
verbestablished referent
established/new referent
new referentwhere 0 means no overt noun phrase and PRO any pronominal affix.
Pattern 1 has already been illustrated and discussed elsewhere (exam­
ples (5-67a,b) and discussion thereof) , as has pattern 2 for established
referents (examples 5-65a,b) . In considering how new referents are intro-THE PRONOMINAL AFFIX SYSTEM FOR CORE NOMINALS233duced, let me consider the unambiguous case, pattern 3, first. Examples
of this follow:
(5-73) a. num-n-mat
Kampramanan wapal-k
village-OBL-PL hill name
climb-IRR
'The villagers climbed Kampramanan. '
paympan
b . m-n
impa-tay-k
NR DIST-Ill SG 3PL 0-see-IRR eagle III SG
'It, the eagle, saw those two.'
pu-nan-JJa-t
c. patn
betelnut V SG 3PL A-2SG D-give-PERF
'They gave you betelnut.'
(5-73a) has an intransitive verb, wapal- 'climb', with no pronominal
affixes; (5-73b) a transitive verb, tay- 'see', with only one pronominal
affix, that of the 0 argument; and ( 5-73c) a ditransitive verb, va- 'give',
with only two pronominal affixes, A and D. In each case, the missing
core argument is provided by an overt noun in the clause: numunmat
'villagers' in (5-72a) , paympan 'eagle' in (5-73b) , and patn 'betelnut' in
(5-73c). These examples all come from running texts in which these
nouns are just being introduced or re-introduced after a longish gap.
They are new information.
Given the earlier claim that the pronominal affixes fill the argument
positions of the verb, an important question is what is the relationship
to the verb of these nouns without coreferent agreement affixes? The
simple answer is just the same, but in this case they are linked to a
zero pronominal affix. In other words, Yimas has much in common
with the feature of uncontrolled 'pronoun drop' in East Asian languages
like Japanese, Thai, and Indonesian. To see how this analysis would
work, consider (5-73b) again. The transitive verb tay- 'see' has two core
arguments, A and 0 (I am here considering the notion of transitivity and
associated arguments to be a straightforward notion in Yimas. This
is not entirely the case, but it is best to postpone the discussion of
this until Section 6.2.1.). This transitive verb only has a single overt
agreement prefix, the prefix impa- 3DL 0, but, as it is a transitive verb,
it must have an A participant. Because of pragmatic reasons, i.e., the
referent of the A is a new participant, this is realized by a zero prefix.
A zero prefix is exactly that, one which has no specifications for class,
person and number and may therefore be linked to any noun which is
morphologically marked as core, i.e. , is not suffixed with the oblique
suffix -n """" - nan. Both noun phrases in (5-73b) meet this requirement,
m-n NR DIST III SG and paympan eagle III SG. But as they have the
Harne noun class and number specifications, they clearly have the same234BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYreferent, which is linked to the zero A prefix and interpreted with the A
role.
Example ( 5-73c) is similar, except that it contains a ditransitive verb
va- 'give' with overt agreement prefixes for A and D, but a zero prefix
for T. The clause contains a morphologically core noun patn 'betelnut'
which is linked to the verb through the zero T prefix and interpreted as
the theme.
Now consider example ( 5-73a) . This sentence contains an intransi­
tive verb, wapal 'climb', with no agreement prefixes and two associated
noun phrases. One of these, numnmat 'villagers', is morphologically a
core argument; the other, Kampramanan 'place name', is morphologi­
cally oblique, with the oblique suffix -n ""' - nan. Hence only numnmat
'villagers' may be linked to the zero S prefix on the verb and interpreted
in the S role.
This last example points up a very important constraint on the gram­
maticality of Yimas clauses which I will call the completeness constraint
(Foley and Van Valin 1984, 183) . It states that a noun may be realized
morphologically as a core argument (i.e., without the oblique suffix - n ""'
- nan) if and only if it is linked to a pronominal affix on the verb (which
may be zero). In other words, a noun without the oblique suffix must
be linked to a pronominal affix and a noun with it never can. The verb
wapal- 'climb' is a good one to illustrate this principle with. Although
basically intransitive, as in (5-73a) , it is actually ambitransitive like its
English equivalent. English climb is intransitive in the child climbed to
the top of the tree but formally transitive in the child climbed the tree.
Yimas behaves identically.

coconut palm IV SG-OBL 3SG S-climb
'He climbed up on the coconut palm.'
b. irpm
mu-n-wapal
coconut palm IV SG IV SG 0-3SG A-climb
'He climbed the coconut palm.'
(5-74a) contains wapal- 'climb' used intransitively with a single S prefix.
The noun irpm-un coconut palm IV SG-OBL is not a core argument and
therefore occurs with the oblique suffix. In (5-74b), the verb wapal is
used transitively and has both the A prefix n- 3SG A and the 0 prefix
mu- IV SG 0. Now irpm 'coconut palm' must be realized morpholog­
ically as a core argument and lack the oblique suffix. The use of the
oblique suffix in (5-74b) will result in ungrammaticality.

used to express new referents, let me return briefly to the case of pat­
tern 2 constructions (i.e. , NP PRO-verb), which may also express new
referents. It is important to remember that pattern 2 is potentially
ambiguous; it can also express established referents, as illustrated in
(5-65) . Pattern 2 , (noun phrase plus PRO-verb) commonly has a strong
contrastive component to its meaning. For example, it is generally used
in answer to an information question when the question word functions
as 0 or D.
(5-76) a. Q: nawn ma-tpul
who 2SG S-hit
'Who did you hit?'
b. A: .uaykum
pu-ka-tpul
woman II PL 3PL 0-lSG A-hit
'I hit the women'
Here, vaykum 'women' is the focus of the answer. This is indicated both
by an independent noun and the verbal agreement affix pu- 3PL 0.
In other cases, new referents are introduced through pattern 2 if they
are especially important new props in the development in the discourse
around which its progression turns, as in this example from a traditional
legend:
( 5-77) JlCt
mnta
ya-n-awa-ta-k-nakn
urine V PL and then V PL 0-3SG-excrete-put-IRR-3SG D
'And then she urinated on him.'
Although pet 'urine' is a new participant here, it is an important one,
because by noticing the urine, the man locates his daughter, and the
remaining plot of the story unfolds.
These examples are meant to give the reader a general feel for the
pragmatic, discourse-based differences which determine the choices of
pattern 1, 2 or 3. Because they are pragmatic and discourse-based, it is
impossible to write hard and fast, all-encompassing rules. Rather, there
are devices left open to the speaker to use creatively as he frames the
text. Some of the general principles involved I have discussed here, but
a more complete account will have to remain for a later more detailed
Htudy of Yimas discourse structures. The reader who is especially inter­
eHted is invited to study the texts at the end of this grammar and try
to work out some of these principles himself.
�.2 Tense, Aspect, and Mood
Yimas has a very rich system of tense, aspect, and mood distinctions.
Some aspectual distinctions are expressed through incorporated adver-BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGY236bials and compounded verb stems and will be discussed in the relevant
sections in the next chapter (Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2). In this section, I
will only treat the aspect distinctions which are indicated in the suffixal
slots. Mood really corresponds to two separate inflectional categories in
Yimas: modality and illocutionary force. Modality is expressed through
a set of modal prefixes which occur verb-initially, before the pronomi­
nal prefixes, while illocutionary force distinctions such as imperatives or
hortatives are indicated by distinctive inflectional patterns with specific
pronominal affixes.
5.2.1 The Tense/ Aspect System
The only affixal position of a finite verb which is obligatorily occupied is
that of tense. This is a suffixal position following the verb stem(s) and
preceding the paucal and dative suffixes. If these latter are lacking, it
will occur in word final position.
(5-78) a. patn
na-kay-!Ja-ntuk-mpun
betelnut V SG V SG T-1PL A-give-RM PAST-3PL D
'We gave betelnut to them long ago.'
b. tan ipa-wa-ntut
there 1PL S-go-RM PAST
'We went there long ago. '
Note the alternation between the non-final form of the RM PAST tense
suffix, ntuk , and the final form, - ntut. This pattern of alternation be­
tween non-final and final forms is a common feature of the tense suffixes
in Yimas.
The tense/ aspect system of Yimas makes nine distinctions. The pri­
mary distinction is strictly not one of tense, but a modal one. But since
this is realized in the same suffixal slot as all the other tense distinctions,
it will be treated as part of the same paradigmatic system here. Thus,
the basic distinction in the Yimas tense/aspect system is between unreal
and real events. Unreal events are marked by the irrealis suffix -k ""' - T)k,
which indicates that the event so marked is outside the continuum of real
time, e.g. , in the legendary past or in the indefinite future (see Section
5.2.1.1). Real events must be marked by one of the other tense/aspect
suffixes. These express an eight way contrast. Yimas has two basic past
tenses: a near past, for events which occurred yesterday; and a remote
past, for events which occurred any time since the legendary past up
to about five days ago. In addition there is a far past, composed of
the remote past suffix plus the suffix -kia, discussed in Section 5.2.1.2,
which is used for events occurring from two days ago to five days ago,
although the boundary between this and the remote past is flexible, and
-TENSE, ASPECT, AND MOOD237a switch from the remote past to the far past is often used for nuances
of vividness in narratives. The present tense is used to express events
which occurred today, but is divided according to aspectual contrasts.
There is a three-way aspectual contrast for present tense: perfective, for
events which are completed; imperfective, for events which are ongoing;
and habitual, for events which recur regularly according to the normal
expectations of life patterns in the community. Finally, there are two
future tenses: a remote future, for events which are fully expected to
occur the day after tomorrow or later; and a near future, for events
expected to occur tomorrow. The contrasts in the Yimas tense-aspect
system may be summarized in the following schema:
events
----- ---real
unreal
------ 1 ------present
past
future
--- I -----._

The irrealis suffix is used in Yimas to indicate events which are located
outside of the continuum of real time: they must be completely timeless,
in the legendary past or in the indefinite future. In other words, it marks
events whose temporal coordinates cannot clearly be fixed by the speaker
in what he regards as experiential time. Because the irrealis occurs at
both ends of the temporal continuum, it may be conjectured that Yimas
speakers view time not as an open infinitely expandable line, but as a
closed circle.
UNREAL TIME
IRR
PRESENT
REAL TIME
This is a tempting speculation, but there is no evidence at present, other
t han the distribution of the irrealis suffix to affirm or deny it.
The use of the irrealis to express timeless events is prototypically
indicated by its use with the copula. If the reader will glance back at
the forms of the copula in Section 5.1.5, he will note that all forms
l.!�rminate in the irrealis -k. The copula is used in statements which hold238BASIC VERBAL MORPHOLOGYtrue generally and are not bound to particular periods of time. In fact
the use of any other tense/aspect/mood inflection with the copula is
ungrammatical.
The irrealis suffix is probably most commonly found in traditional
legends, where it is almost invariably used, although the remote past
would also be an option. Consider the following:
(5-79) a. tan impa-ampu-mpi-awl-k
there 3DL S-float-SEQ-take-IRR
'They both drifted there.'
b. impa-mpu-yakal-irm-tay-Jlcut
3DL 0-3PL A-CONT-stand-see-RM PAST
'They stood watching them both.'
These two examples come from the same text and are separated only by
a single sentence. Both take place in exactly the same time period, the
legendary past, yet one is marked with the irrealis and the other with
the remote past suffix. In terms of absolute time reference, there is no
difference in this text between the irrealis and the remote past. But the
use of the remote past implies that events occurred in the stream of real,
albeit remote, time, while the irrealis removes them from the continuum
of real time altogether and situates them in the period before real time
as apprehended by men began. The use of the remote past in such
traditional legends is actually rather less common. In the text from
which the sentences in (5-79) were drawn, that of the creation myth,
less than 20% of all sentences in the legendary past are inflected with
the remote past suffix, the rest occur with the irrealis. Quite commonly,
a speaker will start a legend with the remote past suffix, but by the
third or fourth sentence will switch to the irrealis and remain with that
through the rest of the text. Also, it is sometimes the case that a speaker
will switch from the irrealis to the remote past in the denouement of a
text: this provides a vivid or immediate coloring to the events described.
The irrealis may also mark as yet unrealized future events. In this
case, it contrasts with the remote future tense. Consider these examples:
(5-80) a. ama patn
wayk-k
lSG betelnut V SG buy-IRR
'I want to/will buy betelnut.'
b. patn
na-ka-wayk-kt
betelnut V SG V SG 0-lSG A-buy-RM FUT
'I will buy betelnut after tomorrow.'
The remote future suffix -kt , as in (5-80b) , commits the speaker to the
belief that the event described will definitely or at least is highly likely
to occur in the future. The irrealis suffix requires no such commitment.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]"

In both the examples in (7-10), the /r/ of - ru would appear as t if it were
not for the adjoining high front vowel. This simply causes palatalization
of t to c. Note that, unusually, palatalization does not spread rightward
in the first example from c to the adjoining n and t.
There are other cases in which the /r/ appears as c without benefit
of an intermediate stage t , for in these examples, if it were not for the
presence of a segment with the F autosegment, the r would remain
unchanged.

Note that in this last example, the general rule of unstressed fu/ deletion
is blocked. The morpheme specific rule for - ru NFN converting /r/ to
c after a segment associated with F takes precedence and after it has
applied, the environment for the general rule no longer exists.
The final variation to mention for the segment /r/ in -ru is in verb
plus noun compounds. In these constructions it is invariably realized
simply as t.

The suffix -ru NFN is used as the basic derivational suffix in all sorts
of nominalization constructions. These are very common in Yimas, for
they correspond to the general embedded or complement constructions
of other languages. Perhaps the most straightforward kind of nomi­
nalization is agentive nominalization, equivalent to English - er. There
are seven different morphemes to indicate agentive nominalizations in
Yimas, a distinct masculine and feminine form for each of the threeNON-FINITE N OMINALIZATIONS381numbers, singular, dual and plural, and a paucal form, undifferentiated
for gender, as in the following:
M
F
-ma!J
SG -awt
DL
-mampan
-mprump
PC
-JJ�
-nput
PL -mat
With the exception of - awt M SG and - mat M PL, these forms are closely
related to the adjectival concord suffixes for classes I and II. Forms with
these suffixes are all subject to the phonological rules discussed above:
in addition, the /u/ of - ru NFN regularly deletes before -vkt PC.
(7-14) fampa-ru-JJkt/ > amparvkt
'a few weavers'
weave-NFN-PC
The feminine suffixes for agentive nominalizations are only used in the
non-singular to refer to groups which are exclusively female: mixed
groups are denoted by the masculine suffixes. The masculine forms
are also used for animals and inanimate objects. Examples of agentive
nominalizations follow:
(7-15) a. kpanti-pramuJJ-tu-mat
big-sleep-NFN-M PL
'people who sleep too much'
b. irut
ampa-r-ma!J
mat IX PL weave-NFN-F SG
'a mat weaver (F)'
c. pacuk-r-awt
copulate-NFN-M SG

d. ta!Jkway-cakal-cu-mprum
VIS-feel-NFN-F DL
'the two women that look after (the children)'
e. namtamparawt-Jlan api-c-awt
foot IX DL-OBL
put in-NFN-M SG
'a sock'
These agentive nominalizations always carry a habitual meaning: they
denote an object or person (or group of people) which typically per­
forms the action of the nominalized verb root. This habitual or typical
meaning is readily apparent in all of the above examples, but perhaps
especially clear are (7-15a,e). If one wishes to form an agentive nominal­
ization to express a non-habitual performer of an action, a finite relative
clause must be used (see Section 7.2.1). Note that agentive nominal-382INTERCLAUSAL RELATIONSizations in Yimas are commonly associated with nouns or adverbials,
much like those of English: dishwash-er, story tell-er, hard work-er. In
both languages such nouns may never function as A participants, but are
typically 0 or T arguments. The last example (7-15e) with the oblique
suffix -n ""' -nan, illustrates an agentive nominalization that has actu­
ally been realized as the head noun of a noun plus noun compound (see
Section 4.4), much like English blackboard erase-r. As with English dish­
washer versus dish maker, the boundary in Yimas between compounds
and agentive nominalizations is rather fuzzy.
These suffixes have a number of other uses besides marking agentive
nominalizations. Some of these involve subordinate clauses and will be
discussed in the relevant sections on relative clauses (see Section 7.2.1)
and temporal adverbial clauses (see Section 7.2.3); here I will confine
myself to word-level uses. These suffixes can be added to locative words
with or without the oblique suffix -n ""' -nan to express a person or
people associated with that place.

The oblique suffix plus - awt M SG, etc. can be added to Tok Pisin words
denoting other areas of Papua New Guinea and, indeed, the world, to
indicate the inhabitants of that area.

These suffixes are also added to a stem pan- (of no separate meaning,NON-FINITE NOMINALIZATIONS383but probably related to panmal 'man'), to derive contrastive pronouns
'myself', 'yourself', 'himself', 'themselves', etc. Consider these examples:
(7-18) a. ama pan-awt na-ka-tu-t
1SG self-M SG 3SG 0-1SG A-kill-PERF
'I killed him myself.'
b. pan-put kalk

c. m-n
pan-awt-mpwia ""ama paympan
NR DIST-1 SG self-M SG-QUOTE 1SG eagle
tampan""
NEG COP
'He himself said ""I am not an eagle."" '
These contrastive pronouns sometimes occur with the oblique suffix but
with no apparent difference in usage or meaning. Compare (7-19) below
with (7-18a):
(7-19) m-n
pan-awt-jlan trmantak
NR DIST-1 SG self-M SG-OBL spear V SG
na-n-awkura-ntut
V SG 0-3SG A-get-RM PAST
'He got a spear himself.'
These pronoun forms are contrastive in that they indicate that the per­
former of the action is exhaustively defined by their referent, i.e., 'it is
they and no one else who X-ed'. Thus these forms always denote agen­
tive participants. This explains to a certain extent their morphological
formation. The suffixes - awt M SG, etc., are of course most commonly
used to derive agentive nominalizations. Because of the meaning of pan-,
it varies between a purely contrastive and a reflexive usage. Consider
these examples:
(7-20) a. m-n
pan-awt na-n-tu-t
NR DIST-1 SG self-M SG 3SG 0-3SG A-kill-PERF
'He killed him himself.'
*'He killed himself.'
