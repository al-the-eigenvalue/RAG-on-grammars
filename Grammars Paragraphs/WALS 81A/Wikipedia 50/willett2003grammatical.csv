"In example (53), the Ist person sg.subject is marked by the intransitive clitic kn. Again, there is no overt intransitive

When overt noun phrases are expressed, the basic transitive word order is
VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order as shown in the following

"Iintroduced the four determiners and three demonstratives that have been
identified for Nxa?amxcin, and then looked at oblique and locative prepositions.
In the final section on noun phrases, I reviewed the syntax of genitive phrases.
I then turned to the syntax of various types of clauses. I illustrated that
simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive, and the unmarked VOS for
transitive clauses, noting that there is some freedom of word order as VSO
constructions are also possible.",[131]
"Hence,they should exhibit some freedom of word order. This is certainly true of
Nxa?amxcin which can have the following combinations, even though VOS

noun incorporating languages (under Baker’s analysis), it is worth investigating
whether or not Nxa?amxcin bound stem constructions share the same propertieswith incorporated noun constructions in languages like Mohawk.
26The term nonconfigurational can be misleading since it has also been
used in the literature in reference to flat (non-binary) structures. However, it is
evident from the tree Baker gives in (196) for Mohawk that this is not his use
here.",[420]
"This VSOordering is not as frequent as VOS, but is possible nonetheless.
One might think that such variations on word order would lead to
ambiguity, but this is not the case. The particle wa, which surfaces in both (54)
and (55), serves as a disambiguating device.",[108]

[...] X-bar theory alone cannot account for everything that is relevant in
the construction of complex words. X-bar theory determines the position
of the head in words and sentences, but it says nothing about the actual
mechanism that effects labeling of nodes within words, that is, the process
by which categorial information and other features are projected up from
lexical entries to produce fully labeled word structures.
In order for the appropriate features to be passed on from one node to another

6.2.1.1Topical Object
Topical object constructions in Salish were first labelled and defined byKinkade (1989a, 1990b), who provides a pan-Salish discussion of thisoperation.18 He defines (1990b:343) the topical object construction as follows:
The main function of the topical object as contrasted with the plain (often
zero) third-person object is to keep track of a topic in a section of
discourse when there is more than one third-person referent present and
the one that is topic has been shifted into a patient role and designated by
a pronominal object marker. In order to maintain its topicality, it is
specially marked.
Topical object voice constructions resemble inverse voice constructions
with respect to relative topicality.",[160]

The “substantivals” of Selish and Wakashan, elements of substantival
significance but used only in combination with other stems or elements of
words and usually unrelated in form to the independent words of the same
significance, furnish apparent instances of incorporation, in that they are
sometimes used as objects of verb stems with which they are combined.
They are however also employed subjectively and adverbially, and are
therefore more than incorporated nouns. The essential nature and function
of these elements is still obscure, and until they become better understood
they also can furnish no proof of objective noun-incorporation.
A. Kroeber 1909:572-3
... it is clear that verbal affixes that refer to nouns, in other words, convey asubstantival idea, are not instances of noun incorporation if they are
etymologically unrelated to the independent nouns or noun stems with
which they seem logically connected. Such affixes are generally either
instrumental (Siouan, Shoshonean) or local (Kwakiutl, Salish) in character,
but may also be employed to represent the logical object or even, in the
case of intransitive verbs, subject (this use is characteristic of Kwakiutl,
Chemakum, and Salish). As long, however, as they are lexically distinct
from noun stems proper, they must be looked upon as grammatical
elements pure and simple, however concrete their signification may seem.
They are logically related to independent nouns of the same or allied
meaning as are tense affixes to independent adverbs of time.
Sapir 1911:251-2
The main reason lexical affixes have not fit neatly into any specific crosslinguistic category is due to their dual or ‘split’? behaviour.","[390, 391]"
"Selkirk recognizes an “apparent need for particular rule statements; a
general X’ schema for compounding does not adequately characterize the
compounding possibilities found in English” (p.13). Anderson claims that
compounds are created by a set of word structure rules which “have much the
same form as phrase-structure rules, but apply only to lexical categories. Word
Structure Rules operate to specify the internal constituency of lexical categories
and (optionally) their heads” (p.299). Both Anderson and Selkirk agree that
these rules must be specific enough so as to rule out any gaps present in the
compounds of a language. Possible stem combinations as well as the feature of
“headedness” are very much language-specific, therefore what is available in the
grammar of a particular language should be encoded in its word structure rules.
For example, a compound of the lexical category verb comprising a verb stem and
a noun stem would be realized by the following Word Structure Rule:dg)VoOVNThe word structure rule in (1) indicates that a verb stem and a noun stem can
combine to form a single lexical item of the category verb. The head of the
compound is underlined.
The semantic interpretation of a compound is closely tied with the conceptof head.",[350]
"In effect, Czaykowska-Higginsargues that a derivational-inflectional distinction like that defined in Anderson
1982, 1988 cannot account for the dual behaviour of the lexical suffixes, thus, alexical-grammatical distinction has more explanatory value in this case.54Czaykowska-Higgins notes that the order of morphemes also supports a
lexical vs. grammatical/morphosyntactic distinction.
5Rice (2000) also takes an alternate view in her morphological analysis of
Athapaskan verbs. Instead of a derivational vs. inflectional distinction, Rice
distinguishes between lexical items and functional items. The former covers items
that are usually labelled derivational, while the latter includes some items that
have been considered derivational and others that have been viewed as
inflectional.",[43]

"89.09.21.533Kroeber (1999: 16-17) notes that the use of clitics with intransitive

the Interior languages. Newman (1979a, 1980) claims that this pattern goes back
to Proto-Salish.

object’ or -stti- ‘causative’ (with a zero 3 sg. object) occurs”.",[302]

Givon (pp.253—254) later defines topicality as follows:
Topicality pertains to nominal participants (‘referents’; most commonly
subjects or objects) of clauses. The propositional information coded in
state/event clauses is typically about some topical participant(s) in the
state/event. Such topical participants are most commonly the subject,
direct-object or indirect-object of the clause, and thus most commonly
noun phrases (‘entities’) rather than verbs (‘events’) or adjectives
(‘states’) [...] In spite of being grammatically manifest at the clause level,
topicality is not a clause-level property of referents, but rather a discourse-dependent one. This is often masked by the fact that one can examine awell-coded clause out of context, and observe all the grammatical devices
that mark participants as referring, topical definite etc. But such isolated
clauses are only artifacts. What makes their participants topical is not the
fact that they are grammatically coded as topical (subject, object) in the
self-contained clause. Rather, they are so coded grammatically because
they are topical across a certain span of multi-propositional discourse.
Their topicality is thus due to their being recurrent referents in some larger
discourse.
Givon (1994, 2001) identifies the major pragmatic voice operations as
inverse, passive and antipassive, and he defines these in relation to the unmarked
active voice in which “both the agent and the patient are topical, but the agent is
more topical than the patient” (2001:94).","[158, 159]"
"The Lahu example in (187b)contains the predicate ‘drink’ preceded by the noun ‘liquor’. The noun is not
marked accusative, as in (187a), and Mithun (p.853) notes that “[i]t qualifies the
type of drinking discussed”.
In other languages the noun and verb stem of lexical compounds combine
morphologically to form a single complex word.",[413]

the field of Salish studies. Researchers such as Kuipers (1968), Hukari (1977),

8.1 What is a Compound?
Anderson (1992:292) defines a compound as “the combination of (two or
more) existing words into a new word”. Such a process, he claims, contrasts with
derivation and inflection which involve “the application of a Word Formation
Rule to a single existing word”.",[349]
