"However, there is in Tiriy6 a more likely cognate for the Kari’na and Tamanaku words:péeto ‘servant, subject’ (as e.g. the inhabitants of a village, with respect to the chief).°11.3.2. Color terms. In order to identify Tiriyé color terms, five different speakers (fourmales and one female; one from Miss4o Tiriés, in Brazil, two from Kwamalasamutu and
two from Tepoe, in Surinam)were consulted. With the help of the computer programPaintbrush (a simple drawing software that comes as part of the accessories folder in
most versions of Windows for PCs), 24 different colored squares, each of which occupies
the whole screen, were prepared; these were shown to the speakers, whonamed themwith Tirty6 color words. Afterwards, the list of all terms was read to the same speakers;
for each word, the speakers were asked to give names of animals,artifacts or naturalobjects that had the corresponding color. Table 11.2 lists the terms which had the most
consistent uses, which are assumed to be more ‘basic’; the remaining words are in Table
11.3. These results are admittedly preliminary and subject to revision.",[611]

"10. SYNTAX10.1. Introduction. Of all aspects of grammar, it is in the realm of syntax that Cariban
languages are least understood, in spite of having attained world celebrity with cases of
OVS as the basic word order (cf. e.g. Derbyshire & Pullum 1981). There are more detailed
studies for twolanguages,Carib(also knownas Kari’na: Hoff1968,1978,1986,1990,1995, and also Gildea 1994a) and Hixkaryana (Derbyshire 1979, 1985, 1986a). The syntax
of fourotherlanguageshasreceivedsomeattention:Apalai(Koehn&Koehn1986),De’kwana (Hall 1988), Macushi (Abbott 1991, Carson 1981), and Waiwai (Hawkins 1998).
Given this situation, any generalizations in the area of Cariban syntax are at best tentative.
Asfarknowledgeextantasgoes,however,Tiriy6isa fairlytypicalCaribanlanguage. It has several recognizable phrase types (cf. 10.2): noun, verb and postpositional
phrases. The possessive noun phrase in Tiriy6 is different from the general Cariban pattern
(cf. Gildea 1998:112-113); the others, however, seem to be almost pan-Cariban (cf. Gildea1998:61ff for the OV
the 3A0verb phrase, described in terms of the morphosyntactic behavior ofprefix n-; cf. Gildea [to appear]clause types (cf. 10.3)for a diachronic perspective). The basic maininclude equative and conjugated or Set I (copular, intransitive andtransitive), which are widely attested in the family, but also remote past (t- -se) and habitual
past(-se)clauses,nominalizations,whichwhichareis alsonot.","[511, 512]"
"Table 10.5
Main tendencies in word order.",[603]
"Oneof the verbal personmarkers,n(i)- (used ontransitive verbs when both participants are third persons), has the syntactic peculiarity of
being in complementary distribution with an overt preverbal object (cf. 5.4.1.1.1, 10.2.2).
(16a-c) illustrate this fact:(16a)An-VOpahkon-etaji-pawana1:father 3AO-hear:Prs.Prf 1-friend
‘My father heard my friend.’(b)AOVvpahkoji-pawanaetal:father 1-friend
_hear:Prs.Prf
“My father heard my friend.’This fact is interpreted as an indication that n(i)- occupies the same syntactic slot
as a preceding object (forming a single constituent with the verb; cf. 10.2.2 for the OV
phrase). Such behavior is reminiscent of e.g. French pronominal clitics such as il ‘him/it’,
which is obligatory as a subject marker, but cannot co-occur with an overt subject (unless
a pause is inserted between the subject and the verb):124

properties that were mentioned in 3.2.1: it does not occupy a specific position within thesentence, it does not have phrasal scope, it takes no morphology, it cannot be separated
from the verb word by any clitics, and it is specific to the verb class. It seems simpler to
analyze it as a prefix, rather than to introduce new criteria so as to be able to add n(i)- tothe set of clitics. Sincethe other person-markingprefixesthe sameoccupyalreadysyntactic slot as a freer morpheme (clitic or independent word; cf. 10.2.2) within the verb
phrase, assuming the same for n(i)- does not entail any extra costs.","[144, 145]"
"509
Of course, as research progresses and more details about the intricacies of Tiriy6
grammarandsemanticsbecomeknown,hypothesesandgeneralizationsare boundtochange. At the current stage of our knowledge, however, the following remark seems valid:
—In order to understand(‘volitionality’,‘affectedness’,the behavior of Tiriy6 participants, semantic‘control’, etc.) do not seem crucial. Participantsfeatures
that showall kinds of combinations of these features (e.g. the A participants of stems like tuuka ‘hit
O’and ene‘see O’, or the S participants of the S, and So verb stems listed in 5.2.2 and5.3.1.1)seemtohavepossiblesubgroupingsthesamethesameof participants,andmorphosyntactic
thepossibilities.morphosyntacticThetreatmentvariousthatgroupings receive, seem to be more insightfully understandable as consequencestheseof theirhistory. Thus, once one realizes that the t- -se(mi) nominalizer and the t- -se ‘Remote Past’
are historically connected (cf. 4.2.2.1.2), the fact that both are involved in ergative patterns
ceases to look like a coincidence;the same is true for the Negative, Supineand HabitualPast constructions (cf. 5.4.3.1). In the spirit of Gildea (to appear), who suggests that word
order for certain constructions may be a consequence of their diachronic evolution rather
than the result of general discourse tendencies in the language, it may be proposed that case
markingand syntactic alignmentconstructions’patternsmay sometimesbe‘fossil remnantsof olderrather than indicators of synchronic meaning. The best candidate for thisinterpretation is the “‘epiphenomenal split-S system’ as described in 5.2.2.","[529, 530]"

In the following sections, various aspects of Tiriyé syntax are examined in detail.
The main formal units (phrases, clauses, sentences, etc.) are dealt with in 10.2-3, while themain semantic units (roles and grammatical relations) are treated in 10.4. A description of
phrase types is given in 10.2, followed by a presentation of the main clause and sentence
types in 10.3 and of complexsentences and subordination in 10.4. A first approach athigher-level problems (coordination, topic, rhneme, and word order) are addressed in 10.4.2
and 10.5.","[512, 513]"
"Asmentioned in 5.1.3, there is some variation as to whether a preceding overt O nominal can
co-occur with the extra t(i)- or not (116m). Notice that, in the forms without the t(i)-, they

with its Habitual Past equivalent, because it was‘easier’ or ‘simpler’. An older speakerclaimed that ‘young people don’t speak like this anymore’ (referring to a Past Imperfective
form). Although further sociolinguistic research would certainly be necessary, a preliminary
impressionis that the Past ImperfectiveSubjunctivein English,or the passéunderstood, but not really used.in Tiriyé hassimplein spokena statussimilar to that of theFrench:it is recognizedand3335.4.3.1.2. Remote Past. In addition to the suffix -se, the Remote Past form has a prefix
which basically has the form t- with vowel-initial stemsand ti- with consonant-initialstems, with the following additional details:—transitive and So stems must occur in their back grade if there is one (whichimplies the changes e > €, aCé > €Cé, and aCo > oCo; cf. 2.6.1 for Tiriy6 ablaut);
— Sa stems take the class-marking prefix w- before the prefix t-. On &-initial stems,
the result is the sequence ti-w- (120m-n); on e-initial stems, the result is t- + lengthening of
the initial e (1200-p; notice that this is idiosyncratic to combinationswith the t- prefix,since the w- occurs as such on nominalizations without t- [cf. 4.2.2.1]). The two consonantinitial non-detransitivized stems ka ‘say’ and té[mil] ‘go’ take a ‘lengthened’ prefix tii- (cf.122q-r); the length can be seen as another realization of the class marker w-.*® The irregular
stems ihté ‘go down’ and oeka / weka ‘defecate’, which take irregular initial consonants in

"3.4.4. Postpositions. Postpositions can inflect for person (with the same markers used to
indicate the possessor on nouns, the object on transitive verbs, and the subject on one
subgroup of intransitive verbs; cf. 3.3.1); they also have a reciprocal form (with a prefix
also found onverbsand on somenouns;cf. 3.3.1.4). Theycan be morphologicallydistinguished from nouns and verbs in that they do not take typical noun or verb affixes

Syntactically, postpositions must always form a postpositional phrase, either by
taking prefixes or an overt nominal object. Postpositional phrases behave like adverbs;
therefore, they cannot be subjects or objects of verbs, or of other postpositions, withoutbeing nominalized.","[168, 169]"

"However, some general observations, based on the most evident patterns, can already be
made about rheme and word order.
About rheme, it is possible to say, judging by the pattern presented by questions and
answers,that it is associatedwith sentence-initial position. Noticethat interrogatives,ifpresent, always begin the sentence, and that the optimal answers have the unknown element
also at the beginning (94a-b); the question marks indicate answers that were considered
‘possible, but less natural’. Sentence-initial position also seems to be important for focus,
considering that it is occupied by elements that correct wrong presuppositions (94c-d).(94a)—aki

reanalysis, it seemssimpler to consider this as one more case of the general pattern: anominalization in a postpositional phrase used to express an adverbial notion. Note also
(88f), which deviates from the general causal semantics of -too_me, and (88g), where it
occurs as the complement in a syntactic causative construction.(88a)koeka-eéé-té-tuuwé,defecate-Sup 2:S,-go-Afterékéin-ee-ja-nsnake 3S,-come-Prs.Ipf-Dbté-eka-fo00_me

to find. Since the text is a first-person narrative, first-person markers and pronouns (/j-/,
/w-/, /wi/) occur relatively often. Certain frequently used items (/tahken/ ‘maybe’, /ahtao/
‘while’,the /eh/ allomorph of the copula, /ke/ ‘Instrumental’, /me/‘Attributivizer’, the/t- -se/ remote past) appear to have a positive effect on /h/ and /e/, which are present in

Tirly6 syntax is also probably typical of its family, though the lack of studies on
Cariban syntax makes this claim difficult to assess. Recognizable constituents include an
OVverb phrase, a (possessor-possessed) genitive phrase, and a postpositional phrase;groups of appositional nouns can sometimeshave phrase-like properties. In the simplesentence, the ordering of constituents is pragmatically determined, with topical elements
tending to occur in initial position. Several kinds of dependent sentences occur, mostly
(but not all) non-finite. Case marking depends on the sentence type: in most cases, it is
(superficially) split-S, but there are also ergative and nominative sentence types. The two
strongest semantic roles are Agent and Patient, with good arguments in favor of Dative as
well;all non-Dativeobliquescan be seenas one broadtypeof CircumstantialsorPeripheral Participants. Grammatical relations (subject, object) are not really useful toolsfor the description of Tiriy6 syntax.
The Tirty6 lexicon includes a high number of surprisingly long monomorphemic
stems (‘roots’). Bisyllabic roots are less frequent than trisyllabic ones, and stems with

(O) of verbs (28a), and objects of postpositions (28b). In possessive constructions, theyinstantiate the possessor and the possessed (28c). In copular sentences, only nouns can
occur in the predicate followed by the attributivizer postposition _me(28d). Whenadirect object noun precedes a transitive verb with a third-person subject, it fills the same
slot as the third-person prefix n-, which means that they cannot co-occur (28e-f). Thus, anoun immediately preceding the prefix n-, like ji-pawana ‘my friend’ in 28f, cannot be a
direct object.(28a)A

former having the advantage of being shorter.'?
All verb stems, transitve or intransitive, can be used as -(ri) class nouns, withoutany overt nominalization marker. Strictly speaking, it is pointless to ask whether or not
there is a ‘non-realized’,‘abstract’ nominalizer;the observed facts are the same,that verb stems can occur with nominal possessive morphology.to wit,In order to indentifythese cases, a “:N” will be added to the gloss (e.g. see:N).

The t- -se ‘remote past’ does not form a verb phrase with an overt O noun phrase.
Thoughusually preverbal,the O noun phrase can occur postverbally (47a-c), it can beseparated from the verb by a pause or by an adverb (47c), and second-position particles can

withwhichto describeit (‘mood’and‘aspect’seemtobeinvolved,but arenotsufficient). The label ‘predicational’ was chosen to indicate that they alter the meaning of
the predicate, by displacing it from actual reality (‘Irrealis’), by limiting it to a small time
span (“Temporary’), or by suggesting, in more than one way, that it is being repeated.
The particle _mo has three apparently very different uses. It occurs in hypotheticaland contrary-to-fact statements, co-occurring with the suffix -i (10a-b; cf. 5.4.1.3.5). In
fact, -i cannot be used without it. Mois also used with the morphological imperatives,the static -(ké) and the allative -ta, to mark a ‘future’ imperative, i.e. an order and/or
suggestion which must be carried out at a later moment (10c-d; cf. 5.4.2). Finally, it was
also found once with the Doubt form of the Future Imperfective (-ta-(ne)), resulting in a
counter-conditional(‘unless’) clause (10e). These apparently divergent uses share thefeature of non-actuality.","[474, 475]"

"‘I am explaining my story to all my friends.’
(lit. ‘I am making/letting all my friends hear my story.’)10.3.3. Remote past clauses. As was seen in 10.4.1, for sentences with a remote past verbform (t- -se; cf. 5.4.3.1.2), there is a mismatch between the case-marking pattern (ergative)
and the control of coreference (nominative). The A participant occurs in a postpositional
(_:ja) phrase, while the O and S participants occur as independent, non-case-marked noun
phrases (an ergative-absolutive pattern, also present in ‘Equi-deletion’ (cf. 10.4.1) and word
order (cf. 10.5)); at the same time, the possessor of a noun marked with the ‘reflexive’possessive prefix t(i)- is coreferential with either the A or S participant—whichever is
present—but never with the O participant (a nominative-accusative pattern). There are noperson-marking prefixes on the verb in the remote past. As with the conjugated sentences
of the previous sections, adverbs and postpositional phrases are free to occur as adjuncts.
These characteristics of remote past clauses are exemplified in (66). Copular clauses
(66a-b) and intransitive clauses (66c-d) have non-case-marked S noun phrases, including
ka‘say’clauses(ideophones(66e-f)and quotations(66g);noticethat the :ja-markedparticipant in (66g) is not an A) while transitive clauses have :ja-marked A noun phrases
and non-case-marked O noun phrases (66h-i). (66j-k) has further examples (in addition to
(14d))of coreferencecontrol,by the A(66j)and S (66k)participants.",[573]

borrowingsfrom native Cariban words (but cf. Rodrigues1985 for cases of apparentborrowingsbetweenpresent,CaribanandTupianlanguages).",[623]
"Asaconsequence, there is a ‘formal schism’ in the number category, which includes particles
(_to(o)), derivational affixes(-to(mo),-ko(mo))and inflectional affixes(-ti(i), -hki(i),3 At one point, it seemed possible that -to(mo) and -ko(mo) (especially the latter) would mark a boundary
between affixes (which precede them) and clitics (which follow them). In view of examples like (21a-d),
however, this idea was abandoned. Notice also that not all speakers agreed with the interchangeability;
some speakers preferred one of the orders, others preferred the other one, and others yet accepted both. This
agrees with the hypothesis of a transitional status for these morphemes. Comparative evidence further
supports this idea: cognates of -ko(mo) in other Cariban languages (e.g. komo in Hixkaryana [Derbyshire
1985:245], kumu in Katxuyana [Gildea, pers.comm.]) were analyzed as independent particles.",[150]

whichcertainstemshaveseveralforms(grades)differingbyonesyllablehasbeendescribed in 2.6.2. To recapitulate briefly, the syllable that differentiates the grades (the
reducing syllable, either the first or the last of the stem) can occur as a full syllable, or then
reduce to one of three possible forms: a single consonant (h, if the non-reduced syllable
Starts with a stop, r ors; n, if it starts with a nasal), lengthening of the preceding vowel, or
nothing at all. The allomorph of the stem in which the full syllable occurs is the full grade;
the others (the reduced grades) are the coda grade (in which the syllable occurs as h or n),
the length grade (in which the reducing syllable occurs as vowel lengthening), and the zero
grade (in which the reducing syllable is dropped). The occurrence of the different grades isconditioned by affixes of different syllabic structures (cf. 2.6.2 for details and examples). In
cited forms, the reducing syllable is written in parentheses.
If the reducing syllable is stem-final, the process is very regular, and was described
in 2.6.2.2.1;sufficeit to mentionherethat stemsendingin r-initialsyllablesarenotpredictable (some reduce and others do not), and that there are two verbs, e(i) ‘be’ and' Of course, most possessible verbal nominalizations (e.g. -to(po), -@) have a corresponding back-grade nonpossessed form (and also with the possessor-marking prefixes k- ‘1+2’ and t- ‘3R’). This, however, is
considered as a purely nominal phenomenon: these are the back grade forms of the nominalizations, not backgrade verbal stems undergoing nominalization (cf. 3.3.1.1, 4.3.1.2).","[248, 249]"

an overt O participant is immediately preverbal, a conjugated (Set I) transitive verb stemoccurs without the n- prefix (i.e. the O participant occupies the syntactic slot of the prefix;

that the i- is a third-person marker (any of the O-marking prefixes described in 5.4.1.1—
j@-‘1’, &‘2’, k@-‘142’, and thusalso i- ‘3’—couldoccurhere,to indicateparticipant). Furthermore, the -i ‘hypothetical’ and -je(pe) ‘incredulitive’the Oforms could beanalyzed as taking a prefix i- (with allomorph @- for vowel-initial stems) instead of
nothing, which would parallel the other i-final prefixes (wi-, mi-, ni-, kii-,etc.). Thisanalysis is adopted here. Of course, this has the consequence that the intransitive forms in
(a-c) and (f) must be seen as having an unexpected i- prefix ((d-e) would have the same
third-person i- prefix that the transitives take in the -i ‘Hypothetical’ form).""!

two groups of stems, i-initial and C-initial ones, and that they merged, producing a mixedmorphological pattern. Comparative research may shed some light on this issue.'”5.1.6.","[258, 259, 260]"
"Ofallareasof a language,thefirstonetoreceivesomedocumentation is the lexicon. For many languages, word lists remain the only kind of
available information. However, most of the lexicon of a language, usually comprisingthousands of words, remains almost always unexplored beyond the first few dozen words
collected by early explorers. In the field of Cariban linguistics, very little lexicographicworkhas been done:with the exceptionof Ahlbrinck1931for Carib of Surinam(Kari’na), Armellada 1943 and Armellada & Salazar 1981 for Pemon, Williams
Makushi,and Mattei-Muller1998for Panare,there are nopublished1932 fordictionariesofCariban languages. Specific semantic fields are also almost never considered in detail,
except for anthropological studies on the studies on kinship terms.
The study of Tiriy6 words and their meanings is still in its infancy; not much ofreal significance can be said at this stage. However, certain ideas and interpretations.
unearthed during the ongoing research on this language, have already been reached, at
least preliminarily, and they may be interesting for the purpose of illustrating some of the
richness of this language, as well as furnishing some material for comparisons with other
languages. Some of them involve certain regularities in word shapes that were not strong
enough to deserve morphological segmentation; these were the formatives mentioned in3.2, discussed in 11.2. Others involve selected semantic fields, containing words which
seemed close enough in meaning to deserve further comparison. They seemed interesting583584

(cf. 5.4.3.1.3): in order to say ‘I don’t kill birds’, Tiriyé speakers use ‘I am birds not-killing’
(71a-f). Like the habitual past, the negative form follows a nominative pattern of person
marking, in that the O participant can occur as a person prefix on the negated verb stemwhile the A and S participants must be either noun phrases or person prefixes on the copula559e(i). There is some evidence that a preverbal O noun phrase forms a verb phrase with the
verb, but the data are scant (cf. 10.2.2). The optional occurrence of the copula makes the
negative clause look structurally different from the habitual past; a further difference is theidiosyncratic third-person O prefix im-, which does not occur on habitual past forms (71b).","[577, 578, 579, 580]"

/ti-moi-je/33 Gildea 1995, based on comparative evidence, suggests that /rV/ syllables follow a different path of
evolution and thus develop idiosyncratic morphophonological properties. In Tiriy6, they seem to be
responsible for most of the cases of irregularities. It is interesting to notice, for instance, that the reducing
suffix /-(ti)/ ‘Possession’ occurs in the coda grade (/-h/) when followed by /t/- or /p/-initial clitics or suffixes, but not /k/-initial ones: /ji-pakoro-h_tao/ ‘in my house’, /ji-pakoro-h_pona/ ‘toward my house’, but
/ki-pakoro-:-kon/ ‘our house’, not */ki-pakoro-h-kon/.
Among the /ri/-final reducing verbs, there is one verb, /epori/ ‘meet O’, which presents an unexpected
irregularity: along with its regular full grade, coda grade (e.g. /w-epoh-tae/ ‘I will meet 0”), and length
grade (e.g. /epoo-se/ ‘in order to meet 0’), it has an allomorph /epon/ that co-occurs exclusively with the
/-ne/-past suffix (e.g. /w-epon-ne/ ‘I met O’).",[108]

alike’ can be termed roles if they are semantically based, and grammatical relations if theirsource is elsewhere (usually, discourse pragmatics). However, if it is true that a clear-cut,
all-or-nothing distinction between semantics and pragmatics is not possible (and sometimes
not even useful), it follows that no deep conceptual rift separates roles from grammatical
relations. Many theories have taken strong positions about distinguishing them, and also
about the number of categories (‘Agent’, ‘Patient’, ‘Subject’, ‘Object’,‘Topic’, etc.) thatthey should include; there might even be a ‘universal set’ of categories from which every500
