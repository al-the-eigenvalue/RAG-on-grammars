"The only extensive morphological system found in the Nimboran
language is the verb-system.1 0 Its productive categories will be described at length in this chapter. The improductive categories and the

"This category we call the category of the Final Infinitive.
The peculiarities in form of some members of this category ask
for a more detailed discussion.
A Final Infinitive, corresponding with an Infinitive with word-initialMORPHOLOGY115consonant immediately followed by an e which is immediately followed
by another consonant, has the same form as that Infinitive, e.g.bekei - 1° to rise, 2° in order to rise,
netJguo - 1° to swallow, 2° in order to swallow,
rCt3gye - 1° to show, 2° in order to show.
A Final Infinitive, corresponding with an Infinitive which has an
initial stop or s immediately followed by a vowel which immediately
precedes a nasal or a vowel which is immediately followed by a nasal,
has the initial consonant of the Infinitive doubled with, in between,
the vowel e immediately followed by a nasal homorganic to that
consonant, e.g.butJ - to wait,
dytJ - to tie together,
dam - to eat,
kitJ - to crush,
sotJ - to water,
tetJgatJ - to knock,
teneitJ - to peel,
deitJ - to stretch out oneself,
doutJ - to draw,bembutJ - in order to wait,

"PART ONE:PHONOLOGYI. THE WORDBefore proceeding to the description of the Nimboran speech-sounds
and their functions, we have to discuss a term whioh - although a
common notion in non-linguistic use - in many linguistic puhlications
is either purposely avoided or used without any definition or discussion:
the word. Our description is based on the standpoint that the Nimboran
language has wOf'ds as its sma!l1est independent meaningful units. As <this
is not the place to set forth the theoretical backgrounds of t'his wewpoints, reference may be made to the existing literature.1
In general, the word, as a linguistic unit, is characterized by:1. a fixed form, connected with a meaning,
2. isolability.
That a word has its own form and meaning, comes from its signvalue. 2 By ""fixed form"" we mean a set of specific sound-characteristics
in a fixed order. Seeming exceptions to this rule will be dealt with
separately (see esp. chapter VIII). The term ""isolability"" does not mean
that every word may be used separately (i.e. as the only constituent of
a sentence), but refers to the fact tha:t words have 1!he possibility of
being separated from surrounding words, e.g. by the insention of other
words.
The assumption of the w01""d, as a basic unit, neither denies the
possibility of border-line cases, like the ""sub-words"", discussed in
Ch. VII, 4, nor is in any way contradicted by the existence of such
border-cases.
Phonological characteristics of words as such will be discussed in
chapters III to VII.
Especially the comprehensive study by A. J. B. N. Reichling: Ret woord.
Een studie over de grondslag van taal en taalgebruik. Nijmegen, 1935. A review
of the history of various theories on this subject is found in: Knud Togeby,

(1949), p. 97-111.

"The members of the only blockading category for the Final Infinitive
are characterized by reduplication of the initial consonant, with the
vowel e in between, in spite of this initial consonant (in the Infinitive)
already being followed by an e without accent and immediately followed
by another consonant.
The members of this category are:
bebesib - in order to bend (Infinitive besib),
bebetao - in order to pull out (Infinitive betao),
bebetyb - in order to throwaway (Infinitive betyb),
dedekuo - in order to enter (Infinitive deMto),
sesebuo - in order to sew (Infinitive sebuo),
tetehao - in order to fry (Infinitive tehao).
The place for a Final Infinitive corresponding with the Infinitive
usifJ - to say, is blockaded by the word uensifJ - in order to say.",[174]
"If an Infinitive has an initial consonant-cluster, the corresponding
Final Infinitive has reduplication of the first consonant only, e.g.brub - to fold,
drii - to defecate,
prib - to throw,
prau - to dance,
spou - to unloosen,
skab - to pinch,
skrey - to shake,
trey - to pursue,bebrttb - in order to fold,

sespou - in order to unloosen,
seskdb - in order to pinch,
seskrey - in order to shake,
tetrey - in order to pursue.",[125]
"If morphological categories contain words belonging to the same
morphological sets, there is a certain relationship between these
categories. Such mutually related categories constitute a m 0 r p h 0log i cal s y s t e m. A morphological system may consist of many
categories.
If categories, belonging to the same system, show opposition and,
therefore, are mutually exclusive within one word, they are of the
same 0 r d e r; categories, not showing opposition, are of different
order. A word may be a member of more than one category but never
belongs to two (or more) categories of the same order.",[65]
"Opposed to the Infinitive forms:
bie - to open (etc.),
buo - to hang out (etc.),
muo - to make (etc.),
syeifj - to cut loose (etc.),we find the following forms:
bebie - in order to open,
bebuo - in order to hang out,
memuo - in order to make,
sesyeifj - in order to cut loose.",[124]
"MORPHOLOGYiao - to rub,
iasi13 - to bathe,117ieiao - in order to rub,

"If an Infinitive has initial hr-, the h is dropped and the r is reduplicated in the Final Infinitive, e.g.hrey - to scream,
hri - to go down,
hrub - to suck,
hru-ry - to break,rerey - in order to scream,
reri - in order to go down,
rerub - in order to suck,
reru-ry - in order to break.",[126]
"But if the first consonant of an initial cluster of and Infinitive is -ry,
the Final Infinitive has the whole cluster reduplicated, e.g.-rygeddu - to shave,
-rygedey - to attach,
-rygrey - to press,-ryge-rygeddu - in order to shave,
-ryge'rygedey - in order to attach,
-rygre'rygrey - in order to press.",[126]
"If an Infinitive has initial u, this u is doubled in the corresponding
Final Infinitive, except if the initial It of the Infinitive is immediately
followed by a second u in which case the Final Infinitive has the same
shape as the Infinitive, e.g.
uau - to rasp,
uo - to dibble,uou - to row,
UU13 - to weed,
uuo - to answer,uuau - in order to rasp,
uuo - in order to dibble,
uuou - in order to row,
uU13 - in order to weed,
uuo - in order to answer.",[127]
"If an Infinitive has initial a, the corresponding Final Infinitive has
the same form as the Infinitive, e.g.di - to shriek,
Iii - in order to shriek,
apid-ry - 10 to fill up, 2 0 in order to fill up.
If an Infinitive has initial i immediately followed by a consonant,
this i is doubled in the corresponding Final Infinitive, e.g.ira - to fill,
i-rygdo - to wash,
isiu - to shake,iira - in order to fill,
ii-rygdo - in order to wash,
iisiu - in order tc shake.",[126]
"If an Infinitive has initial y, the corresponding Final Infinitive has
an u immediately following this y, e.g.
ya - to look for,
ye - to signal,yua - in order to look for,
yue - in order to signal.",[127]
"116THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEIn accordance with the rule given above, the e m between the
reduplicated consonant of the Final Infinitive is followed by a nasal
homorganic to that consonant, if in the Infinitive the vowel, immediately following the initial consonant-cluster, is followed by a nasal,
either directly or with only one vowel intervening, e.g.
kry-ry - to ring,
tri-ry - to dig,
ski-ry - to strangle,
pri-ry - to fly,ke-rykry-ry - in order to ring,
tentri-ry - in order to dig,
senski-ry - in order to strangle,
pempri-ry - in order to fly.","[125, 126]"
"If the initial consonant of an Infinitive is separated from a following
nasal by more than two vowels, the doubled consonant of the corresponding Final Infinitive is separated by e without nasal, e.g.syeitJ - to cut loose,
tyeitJ - to even out (ground),sesyeitJ - in order to cut loose,
tetyeitJ - in order to even out.",[125]
"The same can be done with the rest of the given verb-forms. In this
way, it appears that forms, having a formal element -d- immediately
preceding the Actor morpheme and having as part of their meaning
""the action will take place in the future, or begins in the present and
will continue in the future, or takes place in the present and is directed
towards the future"", are opposed to forms which do not have this
semantic element and are characterized by having -t- or -k- instead of
the -d-. The words characterized by the morpheme -d- constitute a
productive category which we call the category of the Future.
Further study of the use of Future forms shows that the given
formula of the categoric meaning is not broad enough. Because forms
of the Future category are often used to indicate that the actor intends
or wants to perform the action, or that the speaker wants the action
to take place. In the latter case, the meaning may be a command or
a request.
The words, characterized by the morpheme -t- which immediately
precedes the Actor morpheme, all show the semantic element ""the
action takes place in the present or is completed in the present"". They
constitute a category which, again, appears to be productive. This we
call the category of the Present.
Sometimes, members of the Present category are also used when,
strictly speaking, the action does not relate to the present, or is not60TIlE NIMBORAN LANGUAGElimited to the present. For Present forms are used in all those cases
in which the time of the action is unimportant or is left out of account
(in general statements and the like). So it might be said that, semantically, this category is characterized by the absence of a certain element
of meaning and its members have reference to actions, not explicitly
mentioned as belonging to either the future or the past.
The fact that many Present forms are formally characterized by a
zero morpheme - as we shall see later on - may be said to be III
accordance with this.
The words which are characterized by the morpheme -k- have in
common the semantic feature ""the action took place in the past"". They
appear to constitute a productive category which we call the category
of the Past.
The categories of Present, Past, and Future are of the same order.
This we call the order of the categories of Tense. That this order is
different from that of the Actor categories appears from the fact that
all verb-forms, given so far, belong to an Actor category as well as
to a Tense category.
6. The category of the Recent Past.","[69, 70]"
"The structural function of the accent includes:
1° dis tin c t i v e val u e for w'O r d s. This only applies to
plurivocalic words, because infuese the place of the accent is as
distinctive as the character and order of the constituent phonemes
are. This distinctive value is, once more, most clearly demonstrated
by minimal pairs., in this case pairs of words consisting of the
same phonemes in the same order but different in the place of
their accent. Out of the - relatively few - cases of such minimal
pairs we give the following instances:
kie - hand
mere - ourselves
sie - citronella grass
tebu - silentkie - time
mere - kind of fruit
sie - twist
tebu - (cigarette-) stub.2° dis t.j n g u ish i n g the w 0 r d ass u c h. As the place of
the accent in the word-form is not determined by the word-form
itself, the accent can not act as a real border-marker. But from the
number of accentuated vowels in an utterance the hearer obtains
an idea of the number of words in the utterance. The contribution
made by the accent to the recognition of the number of words is
imp<l!ired by the existence of words, having two accents, and of
words, h<l!Ving no accent, but not as seriously as one might expect
In the case of words having only one vowel there is no need for indicating
the accent in writing.
25 This is the reason why we indicate the accent with all plurivocalic words
in writing.

"If we compare the words, given in § 2 and § 3, with the following:13guaduln - she (it) will bite,

uoduln - she (it) will dibble,
uotUln - she (it) dibbles,
uokuln - she (it) dibbled,we find them to be members of another productive category which
has the morpheme -Uln and the categoric meaning of the attribution
of the action to a singular actor, which is not of male sex and not
identical with either the speaker or the person addressed. We call this
the category of the Third Person Neutral. It is found to be in opposition
with the categories belonging to the order of the Actor categories, so
it is of that same order.
5. The categories of Future, Present, and Past.",[68]
"Members of this category are formally identical with those of the
-re13- category of the Unspecified Object (see § 2 under F.). Here
we find separate categories of Dual and Plural. This is in striking
contrast with the situation found in the Plural Object categories
discussed sofar in this § and in the productive Plural Object category.
In the Momentary forms of the First Position category the element
-re1J- has an accent and the Plural forms of Future and Present may
have an i immediately preceding the Actor morpheme.
The members of this category are:
Momentary forms with the root-morphemes
ki13- - order,MORPHOLOGY149tratJ- - call,
ya- - seek;
for these root-morphemes the Iterative 1S blockaded by the -ritJcategory (see under K.);
forms with the root-morpheme iantctJ- - show, which are all in competition with members of the -ritJ- category (see under K.);
forms with zero root-morpheme, having the lexical meaning ""dream
(of)""; the Plural forms have a prefixed i.
Examples:k£erendy - I will order them (here),
tratJkrembeki - you (plur., du.) called them above,
irentiy - we dream of them (here).

u6ke - you dibbled,we see that each word of the first group can be put side by side with
one of the second group, each of these pairs showing the same difference
in form (final u vs. final e) and the same difference in meaning. The
partial difference in meaning, appearing from the use of the words ""I""
and ""you"" in the translation, can be described more specifically as
follows: in one case - that of the words having final u - the action 11
is attributed to the speaker as the actor; in the other case - that of
the words having final e - the action is attributed to a singular
person addressed, as the actor.
More examples can be found ad libitum; further investigation shows
that the number of such forms is, in principle, unlimited. We have
to do with productive categories whose members are characterized
by the formal elements (morphemes) -u and -e respectively. We call
them the category of the First Person (singular) and the category of
the Second Person (singular).
They appear to be in opposition and are mutually exclusive; so
they are of the same order which we will call the order of the Actor
categories.
3. The category of the Third Person Masculine.","[66, 67]"
"Opposed to:
f3guadu - I will bite (here),
f3guakeMu - we two bite above,
f3guatemetJgetim - he is biting repeatedly below,112THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEand all other forms of this verb, discussed so far, we find:1Jgua - 1° (to) bite, 2° bite!, 3° bitten.
There appears to exist a whole series of such forms, e.g. :ki1J - to pack, pack! packed.
Together, they constitute a productive category. Their formal mark
is the absence of any categorial morpheme: they consist of a bare
root-morpheme. The common seman tical element is less easy to
describe. It appears that some heterogeneous semantical elements are
found side by side, distinguishable in the different cases in which the
forms in question are used:
1° just the absence of all the other categorial meanings, in cases like:no po 1Jgua - he wants to bite,
130 l3gua besam - I refuse to bite.
2° a curt order: 1Jgua - bite! For a more polite order, a friendly request
etc. the Second Person Future is used:l3guade - please, bite! have the goodness to bite!
3° a state, caused by being submitted to the action, attributed to a noun:ndie hru me l3gua - that man is already bitten,
hru l3gua be ndie - the bitten man is there.
This use is the same as that of adjectives, e.g.:ndie hru krap6 - that man is bad,
hru krap6 be ndie - the bad man is there.
This category we call the category of the Infinitive.
The indifference of Infinitive forms in regard to the other categories
is seemingly absent in cases like:tao - to put many objects,
dao - to give (take) many objects,
,.au - to roast many objects,
prei - to bring many objects,
as these could be thought to be connected with the Plural Object
category. However, we must assume that these are Infinitives of verbs,113MORPHOLOGYhaving the semantical element of ""many objects"" as part of their lexical
meaning. In the cases of tao, rau, and prei this becomes quite clear
from other forms which, without being Plural Object forms, still
possess the plural object-element in their meaning. The fact that tao,
dao, rau, and prei and words, morphologically related to them, are
used, by way of suppletion (see Ch. I, § 10), instead of the (nonexisting) forms of the Plural Object category of tey - put, tei - take,
give, dey (dy-) - roast, and a series of forms with zero root-morpheme
to which belongs rebedu - I will bring from here to above, respectively,
is not relevant, as the latter have no morphological connections with
the first.
In the examples, cited above, the form of the Infinitive is the same
as that of the root-morpheme in its combinations with the various
morphemes but not the same as the special Singular or Plural stem,
found with some root-morphemes. This appears to be the case with
the great majority of Infinitive forms, e.g.:nC13ga - to light (etc.),
tC13ga13 - to knock (etc.),
sam - to put inbetween (etc.),
skye - to smoke (etc.),
bie - to open (etc.),
13gri13 - to draw, trail (etc.),
tC13gei13 - to cut (etc.),
13gedey - to fasten (etc.),
temY1J - to stab (etc.),uo - to dibble (etc.),sebuo - to sew (etc.),
trao - to lift (etc.),
dou - to start (etc.),
hru13 - to break (etc.),
siab - to pour out (etc.),
peb - to peel (etc.),
pyb - to stick (etc.),
brub - to fold (etc.).","[121, 122, 123]"
"Some proper names, having more than two
vowels, may have - apart from ,the fixed, primary, accent a
secondary accent on a certain VI)wel, preceding the vowel which
has the primary accent. In ~hese cases the two accents are no1
interchangeable. The secondary accent may be absent; this usually
~s the case in fast speech. In writing, this secondary aocent will be
indicated with a grave accent (~), e.g. masdtekdte - mythological
name, hdmot3greintYr> - a field-name, hamongrat3 - name of a village.3° the w '0 r d sam sam. In this word, which means ""slow, in
order"", the two vowds are equally accentuated so that formally
it corresponds with a repeated word like kend6 kend6 - quick (!).
But samsam can not be called such a repeated word, as a simple
form sam does not occur. 29
Therefore, it is impossible to use the accent for the distinction of the word
in Nimboran. Cf. what is said about this by Joseph H. Greenberg in his ""Essays
in Linguistics"", Chigaco, 1957, esp. p. 31-32.
27 For the terms ""morpheme"" and ""root-morpheme"", see Part Two, Ch. I.
28 See Part Two, Ch. II, § 9.
29 A word sam really exists but its meaning is totally different so that it hardly
can be connected with samsam.
26PHONOLOGY39It may be said that all words, having two accents, constitute border
cases between single words and groups, consisting of two separate
words. This view is supported by the fact that consonant-sequences,
which are not found elsewhere, occur in many such words as morphemejunction-markers (s·ee Oh. VI, §§ 2, 3, 4 and 10). They are treated
here as words because of their inseparability.
4. Words without an accent.","[50, 51]"
"In Nimboran, as in most languages, borrowing words from other
languages is an important means for enriching the vocabulary.
Especially in recent times, foreign cultural influence has been the
cause of many words being borrowed. The most important lending
language is the lingua franca, which is used - with some regional
variaDJts - in the coastal areas Oof western New Guinea. This language
we call New Guinea Malay (NGM), for want of a better tenn. This
NGM is not very much different frOom Bahasa Indonesia, the national
language of Indonesia, so that in many cases the question, if a word
was borrowed from NGM or from Indonesian, is utterly senseless.
For words, borrowed by Nimboran frOom other languages - among
which in the first place Dutch must be mentioned -, NGM often, but
not always, served as an intennediary. As Indonesian/Malay was
introduced in primary education already years ago, every Nimboran-44THE NIMBORAN LANGUAGEspeaker has a certain knowledge of this language .and borrows words
from it freely, not only in high-flown speech-making and in technical
statements, but also in everyday conversation. Especially among the
younger generart:ion, garnishing the language with Malay jIndonesian
words is an established custom, even in those cases in which original
Nimboran words would be as good or even better.
2. Adapted and unadapted loan-words.","[55, 56]"
"A morphological category may be productive or improductive. If a
category is improductive, new members can not normally be added,
and, consequently, its members can be enumerated.
Productive categories, however, have no fixed number of members;
they represent a procede that may be extended over ever more words.
Such productive procedes provide a speaker with the morphological
means for forming new words, no matter wether he has heard these
words being used by other speakers or not. Investigating the ways in
which this is performed is the main subject of descriptive morphology.s

In the same way we find, corresponding with members of the First
Secondary Verb category, forms different from them only in having
Actors morphemes of the Apophonic series (and the form of other
morphemes that goes with these Actor morphemes: -de- instead of
-da, -re- instead of -ra-, etc.).
The common semantical element in these words is ""to be in a state,
caused by the action"", or ""to be in a state (denoted by the lexical
meaning)"".
All these forms constitute a productive category which counts among
its members words without corresponding forms in the categories of
Unspecified Object, Masculine Object, Plural Object, Durative, Infinitive, and Final Infinitive, but whose root-morphemes are found
among the adjectives. All what is said in § 48 about the connection
of the First Secondary Verb Category with the adjective and the
Infinitive also applies to this category. Therefore, we call it the Second
Secondary Verb Category.
In this category a series of forms is found with zero root-morpheme

fallacy of preliminary conclusions (the latter case receiving her preferential consideration I).
Work with Dina and other informants in Hollandia was kept going
and supplemented by the results of periodical visits to the Nimboran
villages. During these stays usually no systematic procedures were
foUowed and most of the attenibion was given to the unconstrained, freeand-easy, conversation of the villagers which always yielded pointts. for
further investigation. As a matter of fact, it would have been impossible
without observation on the spot to fonn an accurate idea of the
Nimboran people's environmenit, daily life, and culture and correspondingly of the words of their language and ,the contents of their
conversation.
Although collecting traditional tales was not entirely neglected, the
main object always was the study of the living language: detection of
the rules according to which the Nimboran language is spoken. 44There is only one publication giving information on the Nimboran language,
viz. : G. Schneider,Proben der Nimboran-Sprache. Zeitschrift fUr EingeborenenSprachen, XVIII (1927-1928), p. 128-140. We mention this here only as
a matter of curiosity, as it is the result of superficial observation and so full
of errors that it is of very little use.","[16, 17]"
"58TIm NIMBORAN LANGUAGEwe meet with members of another productive category, the members
of which are marked by the morpheme -aln. The categoric meaning is:
the action is attributed to a singular male being, not identical with the
speaker or the person(s) adressed.
This category is in opposition with the two categories, already
mentioned, and so is also of the order of the Actor categories. We
call it the category of the Third Person Masculine.

"The formal characteristics, marking words as members of a category,
we call m 0 r p hem e s. The use of this term is open to objections,
as in many linguistic publications it is used in a meaning which we
do not want to attach to it, viz. the meaning of a basic structural unit.
In this matter we share Uhlenbeck's view, that ""a morpheme is
merely a moment in a word"".2 Therefore, we would prefer to speak
of ""formal features marking members of a morphological category as
such"". But this would be a long-winded and cumbersome formula and
so we will use the existing word ""morpheme"". However, we do this

"Members of this category are characterized by Actor morphemes
of the Apophonic series and by an element -rem- immediately following
the root-morpheme, except in Dual forms where it immediately follows
the Dual morpheme which then has the form -k-. If immediately
followed by the morpheme of the Third, Fifth, or Ninth Position
category, the form of the characterizing element is -reme-. In forms
of the First Position category, except those of the First
Second
Person, -rem- has an accent.
The members of this category are:+forms with the root-morphemes
ya- - seek,
tra13- - call, which is tra13- also in Plural forms,
ki'l3- - order; this root-morpheme is unchanged III Plural forms;
in the Singular stem the 13 may be dropped, so that it is kieor kie13-;
Plural forms with root-morpheme re- - go, proceed; the Singular
forms are supplied by root-morpheme ki- and the Dual by forms

Some examples:kieremty or kieryremty - I order (here),
yakreme13eri - you (two) will seek below,
tra'l3remenekim - he (they) called far away.",[148]
"The Tense forms discussed in the preceding Section can be opposed
to still other forms, e.g. 13guadu, 13g1£at1£, and 13guaku to 13guapu - I bit.
This word is formally characterized by the morpheme -p-, preceding
the Actor morpheme, and its meaning shows the feature ""the action
took place in the past but not before yesterday"". With precisely the
same difference in meaning we find opposed to 13guade, 13guadam,
13guadum, etc., 13guape, 13guapam, and 139uapum; opposed to bekddu
etc., bekdPu etc.; opposed to te13gandu etc., tC13gampu etc.; opposed to
13grundu etc., 13grumpu etc.; opposed to u6du etc., u6pu etc.
Again, we have to do with a productive category; we call it the
category of the Recent Past. As it appears to be in opposition with
Tense categories, it is of the same order.
To the description of the semantic value of the Recent Past category
must be added that members of this category are also used for denoting
actions, performed in a past more remote than the preceding day, this
to indicate a difference of time in the past. Thus, in a narrative, told
with verb-forms of the Past Tense, a form of the Recent Past may
be introduced to refer to some event that happened at a time, later
than that in which the rest of the story is set.",[70]
"In some members, corresponding with verb-forms with zero rootmorpheme, the place of the root-morpheme is occupied by the morpheme
of the blockading Unspecified Object category to which those corresponding forms belong. This is the case with:

tasi'3 - to make cat's-cradles (see § 2, K.),

"Word-final 1 is Inst, except if immediately preceded by i or 0, as -it
becomes -ie and -01 becomes -uo, e.g.
repe - spoon (Dutch lepel) ,
pinsie - pencil (Mal. pensil) ,
betuo - bottle (Mal. botol) ,
pasiuo - pick (Mal. patjol).
This is a clear case of a word borrowed from Indonesian; the NGM
equivalent is ketimun.
39 Bonggo is an Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) language, spoken in the
coastal area east of Sarmi, north-west of Nimboran.

taringy - flour (Mal. terigu) ,
ngam - chewing-gum (Eng1ish gum),
temante, tomante - tomato (Dutch tomaat or Mal. tomat).
Above we already came across the forms temate and tomate; m this
case different ways af adaptation gave rise to four alternants.
In some cases the changes are less simple than those discussed above.
tuse, used in the expression unduo tuse - cat, can be traced back to
the word tusa which is found in eastern Indonesian languages, but
this leaNes unexplained the change Q1f final a into e. 40
The words 1)gr0Jru and 1)gratue both mean ""tractor, bulldozer,
road-grader"". However, it is uncertain if the model was tractor or
grader. It is not beyornd possibility that the two words blended into Q1ne.
Besides bendera - flag (Mal. bendera), an alternalllt mendro exists,
which :is used particularly by the aged and is regarded as ridiculous
by the young people, more versed in Malay. Likewise especially used
by the older people is ari1)gy as an alternant of harimi1)gu - week,
Sunday (Mal. hari minggu).
'Dhe[""e are more instances of adaption making one word out of what
was originally two, as is the case in harimi1)gu, e.g. tua1)gry - teacher
(Mal. tttan guru - Mister teacher).
In some cases popular etymology caused formal deviations. So for
""co-'Operative"", instead 'Of a form which could be expected from Mal.
koprasi like koprasi, the expression kym prasi, literaIIy meaning
""c'Oconut magic"",41 came into use.
Of the two alternant words for ""maize"", iembrokase and emberekase,
some people think the latter is more correct, as they interpret it with
NGM amberi kasi - foreigners gave it.42
There is another expression aiam fuse, used as an abusive term for women.
The explanation, given by some informants, that its original meaning was
""duck"", does not seem to be. very reliable.
41, This is closely connected with the fact that the Nimboran people think of
means to modern development first of all as magical means for procuring
wealth.
42 It is not easy to see what the real history of this word must have been. It is
rather certain that the first part of it is the word amber - foreigner. Most
probably it came, by a long route, from one of the languages of the Geelvink
Bay area. W ondama, an Austronesian langilage in that area, has as an
equivalent pas-amber - litt. foreign rice. That the constituent parts of the
expression changed places on the way from an Austronesian to a nonAustronesian language, is easily accounted for by syntactical rules, governing
these languages. But the change of pinto k remains unexplained, as long as
we do not know more about the historical backgrounds.","[58, 59]"
"As the categories we came across in the §§ 9 to 12 show mutual
opposition, they are of the same order which we call the order of the
P 0 sit ion cat ego r i e s.
The forms which do not show a formal mark as to ""position"", e.g.
1Jguaku etc., also have their place in this connection. Semantically,
they are not as un-characterized as they seemed to be. A form like
13guaku, if opposed to 13guabaku, 1Jgua13aku, etc., has the meaning ""I bit
here"" or - in a more general formula - it contains the semantic
element ""in the place where the speaker is"". Therefore, these forms
may be said to be members of a Position category with zero morpheme.
We call this the First Position category. Members of this category
are always used in those cases in which the place of the action in
regard to the speaker's position is indefinite or does not playa role,
e.g. in stories, general statements, and the like.
I t must be observed that in some cases the lexical meaning of a
morphological set asks for an a d hoc adaptation of the categoric
meanings of the Position categories, as described in the §§ 9 to 13.
E.g. in forms with the root-morpheme kri- (flee) or with the rootmorpheme uauy- (take along) the position category does not denote
the place w her e but the place fro m w her e the flight or the
taking takes place.

below, from above (far away) to there,All these forms belong to a productive category whose members are
characterized by the formal element -tem- which has its place immediately following the root-morpheme, and Actor morphemes of the
Apophonic series. The semantical element they have in common is
""the action continues"". We call this category the Durative category.
In the Durative category there is no formal opposition between
forms for dual Actor and those for Plural Actor, except for the Third
Person Neutral, whereas all non-Singular forms are, formally, Plural
forms, just like what we found in the Plural Object category. From
forms like saontemty - I am watering (here), it appears that those
verbs which have a special Singular stem in the Unspecified Object
and Masculine Object category, do not show this special form of the
root-morpheme in the Singular forms of the Durative. This also is
parallel to what is found in the Plural Object category.
The Durative category is in opposition not only with the category
of the Unspecified Object but also with the Masculine Object and
Plural Object categories and, therefore, is of the same order. Though109MORPHOLOGYthis is seldom the case, an object may be mentioned in a sentence in
which the predicate is a Durative form. This object, however, does
not have any influence on the verb-form, in other words: Durative
forms are indifferent to sex or number of the object.
It might be said that the Durative category is opposed to the whole
group of non-Durative categories in which the opposition of the three
object categories plays a role. But on purely formal grounds the
Durative category can be seen in one line with the categories of
Unspecified Object, Masculine Object, and Plural Object.
It must be observed that those Position categories whose mutual
formal opposition in the categories of Unspecified, Masculine, and
Plural Object consists only in the difference of the vowels of the Actor
morphemes, lack this formal difference in the Durative forms, as these
all have Actor morphemes of the Apophonic series. The result is that
there is no formal difference between the Seventh and the Eighth or
between the Fourteenth and the Sixteenth Position categories in the
Durative forms.
In most cases also the forms of the First
Second Person and the
Third Person Plural are the same, because all Actor morphemes have
the accent, except those of the Eleventh and Twelfth Position categories
Second Person forms. In
in which this is only the case with First
these two Position categories there is a formal difference between the
First
Second Person and Third Person Plural forms, e.g.:+++priitiembentim - they are throwing from below to here,
priitiembentim - you and we are throwing from below to here,
priitiemsentim - they are throwing from there to here,
priitiemsentim - you and we are throwing from there to here.

"Morphology is concerned with those words which show a partial
similarity in form and in meaning, in so far as their partial differences
in form and meaning show a systematic character. As there appears
to be a good deal of misunderstanding with regard to this matter, we
have to enter, at least, into the basic principles.
In many languages, including Nimboran, groups of words are found
which show a partial similarity in their forms and also have a common
element in their meanings, whereas each of these words can be opposed
to one or more other words from which they are differentiated by
precisely the same formal and semantic element. Such groups we call

by the members of a category, need not be absolutely uniform but may
show some variation, provided that this variation is defined by the
phonemical shape of the word and, therefore, is predictable. If differences are found which are unpredictable, the words in question do not
belong to one category.

speakers of these languages also show many common features in their
cultures.
Of these languages Gresi and Kamtuk are most closely related. The
position of the Kwansu-Bonggrang language may be said to be half
way between these and Nimboran. The position of Mekwei within the
subgroup is a bit more apart. So it might be said thart the geographical
position of these five languages is fairly reflective of their mutual
relationships.
3. How the materials were collected.
The data for the present description were gathered in the years 1954
to 1957. In the following years from time to time incidenta:1 additions
were made. The way of collecting data was based on the assumption
that '<lin accur<lite idea of the structure of a language can only be formed
when the 'reseal'cher has acquired a sufficient degree of mastery - both
active and passive - of the language in question. This appeared to be
an exacting and timetaking affair, but was most remunerative. However,
even if the researcher learns to speak the language, he can ill dispense
with the help of informants, because otherwise he might stand in
jeopardy of describing not the language itself but only tht part of it
whioh he has learned to use. On the other hand mastering the language
is a powerful means to the efficient use of informants.
During ;these years so m<liuy people served as informants for the
r'esearch from which the present description has resulted, that it is
imposs~ble to mention all their names. But an exception must be made
£01' Dina N apo, an adolescent girl, who was a daily collaborator f'Or
years. She proved to possess an outstanding intelligence and a natural
gift for linguistic work whioh was not hampered by any preconceived
theory whilch might have made it less easy for her to look upon her
language with an open mind. Very soon she got a dear perception of
the how and why of linguistic research and helped to think out means
to discuss linguistic matters in her own language, showing great powers
of invention in coining grammatical terms -etc. Moreover, she had the
sense not only to check up - in a crafty, subtle way - doubtful points
wi,tIh other informants, but also to be constantly in search for exceptions

"The formal element, common to all these words, is found immediately
preceding the Position morpheme or, if the latter is zero, immediately81MORPHOLOGYpreceding the Tense morpheme. This common element is -man- if
immediately preceding t, d or s, -mam- if immediately followed by p
or b, and -1na13- if immediately followed by k; it appears to be -ma13together with the 13 of the Third Position category and -man- together
with the n of the Fifth Position category. Moreover, all these forms
show the ending -am which is the same as the morpheme for the Third
Person Masculine except for always having an accent, whereas in the
forms of the Future and Past of the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth
Position categories the Position morpheme has no accent. The combination of this -am with the Position morpheme in those forms in
which the Tense morpheme is zero (Present - Recent Past forms of
the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Position categories) is the same
as found in the corresponding forms of the Third Person Masculine.
The common semantical element in all these words, represented in
the translation of the examples by ""you and I"", is more accurately
described by the formula ""the action is attributed to a singular person
addressed and the speaker together as an actor"".
All these forms appear to be members of a productive category which
is of the order of the Actor categories. This category we call the
category of the First
Second Person Singular.
In the same category we find:+bekamambaram - you and I will kick above,
te13gamantam - you and I knock (here),
13grumansakam - you and I hung up there,
u6marJke13am - you and I dibble (dibbled today or yesterday) below.","[90, 91]"
"Having mentioned the semantic element that is common to the
members of a category, we now have to state this view more fully.
For in certain cases the members of a category are distinguished from
correlated words not so much by an element of meaning as by a
difference in syntactic val e n c e. 4 By this term is meant: systematic
combinability with other words; e.g., the English words sings and
singer (in: The man sings a song and The man is a good singer) have
different syntactic valence (and therefore are not interchangeable). As
a common syntactic valence and a common element of meaning do not
exclude each other - the latter is even usually found in combination
with the former - , we may say that members of a category have in
common: an element of form
an element of meaning and/or
syntactic valence.",[62]
