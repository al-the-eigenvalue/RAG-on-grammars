"the clause829(13) xa-kàrm5le} rába gò‰a.} ‘It is an orchard (which is) very large.’
(A12:9)
When the adjective occurs in the same intonation group as the head noun,
the copula is placed at the end of the phrase, e.g.
(14) ""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n.} ‘I am an old man.’ (A8:43)
(15) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} ‘It is a long story.’ (A25:52)
(16) xa-qèßß6t rába mapš6mànt5la.} ‘It is a very sad story.’ (A4:31)
On some sporadic occasions the copula is placed on a quantifier or intensifier particle that stands before the head of the predicate, e.g.
(17) ráb5wa náše xêðye.} ‘The people were very happy.’ (B15:12)
(18) ráb6xwa xèðye pßìxe.} ‘We were very happy and cheerful.’ (B16:6)
(19) t8r6t ""ùmra} ráb5wa kòpa.} ‘The door of the church was very low.’
(B15:2)
(20) kúlla qumašàt ""7-ga bíš-w5wa rešàye.} ‘All the material at that time was
of the very best quality.’ (B10:45)
This retraction of the copula can be regarded as a device for expressing the prominence of the intensifier particle. The predicate as a whole
expresses new information, so the particle is not being singled out as the
only information focus in the clause. This is reflected also in the prosody,
in that the nuclear stress is placed at the end of the predicate, which is
intended to mark the whole phrase as new information. Rather, within
the new information of the predicate, the intensifier is being given an
enhanced prominence. This can be compared to a construction with a
compound verbal form such as (21), in which the copula is moved back
onto the quantifier raba to give it an enhanced prominence within the
new information of the predicate:
(21) zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ‘I had cultivated it with
my hands and greatly toiled in it.’ (A17:32)
When the subject constituent is postposed, in some isolated cases it is placed
after the head noun of the predicate but before a dependent modifier.
This applies to (22), in which the independent subject pronoun intervenes
between a noun and its adjective. As with other cases of postposed subjects,
the clause has a status of a comment on what precedes it:830chapter seventeen(22) káze xoš-ßlìg6n} yalúnka ""áti zòr5w6t.} ‘He tried (to persuade him to go)
“Go down, you are a young child.” ’ (A29:28)
17.1.2. Independent Copula
17.1.2.1. Basic Predicate
An independent standing copula without a subject constituent is attested
in the text corpus in two contexts.
(i) Present Copula before the Predicate
These tend to occur as answers to rhetorical questions such as (1) and (2):
(1)
(2)""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèw6n.} ‘They put
the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
(B6:38)
x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
it? It is water.’ (B6:53)This type of question and answer structure has a similar function to
clauses with an independent copula after the subject such as guða ""ile g6ld6t
heyw6n, x5la diya ""ila miya (§17.1.2.2.), which typically supply an explanatory
or elaboratory comment on what precedes.
(ii) Past Copula after the Predicate
These constructions do not appear to be significantly different in function
from corresponding ones with an enclitic copula. The ‘heavier’ coding
brought about by the prosodic separation may have been exploited by the
speaker to give the clause added prominence, e.g.
(1)
(2)gu-bˆ°a wéwa.} ‘He was in the house.’ (A6:1)
rába tàza ""iyéwa.} ‘It was very good.’ (B5:55)17.1.2.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
Clauses containing an independent standing copula generally have a
subject constituent in the form of an independent pronoun or a nominal.
The constructions discussed in §17.1.2.1. which lack a subject constituent
are far more rarely attested in the text corpus. The subject constituent is
regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate. The copula
is placed either before the predicate, immediately after the subject (1–6),the clause831or is placed after the predicate (7–10). This applies both to the present
and the past copula.
(1)
(2)
(3)""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
(4) b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
(A26:55)
(5) m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
wood.’ (B5:87)
(6) w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ‘He was an angel.’ (A8:25)
(7) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
(8) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
(9) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)
(10) tròßa} ""áni milàne ""iy7wa} ‘In fact, they were green.’ (B5:218)
The placement of the copula immediately after the subject in clauses such
as (1)–(6) expresses the topical prominence of the subject. This reinforced
coding of the topic in initial position functions as a discourse boundary
marker. The construction is used either in statements that supply explanatory information concerning what precedes or in statements that open
a section of discourse. When acting as explanatory comments on what
precedes, they differ from constructions with postposed subjects such as
(§17.1.1.2., examples 18–24) in their degree of independence and prominence. The postposed subject constructions are incidental comments that
are tagged onto what precedes. The constructions with the initial subject
and following copula are presented as important pieces of information,
which typically have relevance for what follows as well as being explanatory of what precedes.
As remarked, the position of the copula after the subject expresses the
topical prominence of the subject. The prosodic detachment of the copula
as an independent word can be interpreted as a ‘heavy’ grammatical coding
device intended to give the clause as a whole prominence and distinctness.
Construction such as (7)–(10) which have have a prosodically independent
copula after the predicate exhibit this latter device. They can, therefore, be
regarded as expressing some degree of prominence. Indeed, they can all
be interpreted as being intended as important statements in the contexts832chapter seventeenin which they occur. They lack the additional device of reinforcing the
topical prominence of the subject as a means of marking their distinctness. It should be noted, however, that in the attested examples of this
construction a pronominal subject is always expressed by an independent
pronoun (cf. 7, 8, 10) rather than zero anaphora. This in itself is a ‘heavy’
coding device designed to mark a boundary (see §17.7.4.).
The subject constituent in clauses with an independent copula is not
postposed after the predicate. This can be explained by the fact that, as
seen in §17.1.1.2, the postposition of a topic subject constituent, is typically used as a device to bind cohesively the clause with what precedes
as a form of incidental tag. This is incompatible with the function of the
independent copula as a marker of distinctness and independence from
what precedes. An apparent exception to this is (11):
(11) r6š-kúlla d-áni ""íla S6ttìye.} ‘Above all of these is S6ttiye.’ (A25:22)
Here the inflection of the copula agrees with the noun S6ttiye and in this
respect the latter would normally be construed as the grammatical subject.
In terms of information structure, however, the initial prepositional phrase
containing the anaphoric pronoun is clearly more topical than the noun
S6ttiye, which is the asserted focus of new information.
The initial subject constituent is sometimes separated from the rest of
the clause by an intonation group boundary. This is a further prosodic
device to reinforce the prominence of the initial topic in order to give the
clause as a whole distinctness in the discourse and disjoin it from what
precedes, e.g.
(12) ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} ‘A flat-bread is thicker.’ (B6:49)
(13) Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrians.’ (B6:17)
(14) M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zìne} ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘M>mo was in
""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)
17.1.3. Deictic Copula
17.1.3.1. Basic Predicate
When the deictic copula occurs in a clause without a subject constituent,
it is normally placed before the predicate (1–3).","[867, 868, 869, 870, 871]"

(19) ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše.} ‘The Christians were not slipping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)
15.13.3. Independent Pronouns
Independent personal or demonstrative pronouns are occasionally used
in the direct object position. In such cases there is generally agreement
on the verb in the form of a coreferential pronominal element, except in
the aforementioned circumstances where agreement tends to be omitted,
e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)dáx p5rmènne ""àwwa?} ‘How can I slaughter him?’ (A15:9)
""áwwa xá-ga xéta d5r7le gu-mìya.} ‘They put it again in water.’
(B6:44)
lát-°i°a ""ána mpaló†6lli m-gu-sêj6n.} ‘You did not come to take me out
of jail.’ (A26:82)In (4)–(6) the independent object pronoun is in narrow focus and the
agreement is omitted:
(4)
(5)
(6)""ána ""àti b8y6n.} ‘I want you.’ (A25:31)
""àyya b8y6n.} ‘I want her.’ (A8:91)
m7°6x ""ày k6sle-díye.} ‘Let’s take her to him.’ (A4:3)It should be noted, however, that there is a greater tendency for the
agreement element to be omitted when the object is a 3pl. demonstrative pronoun than there is with other types of independent pronominal
object, e.g.
(7)
(8)
(9)pálš6x ""áni. ‘Let’s fight them.’ (A14:52)
bár d-ày,} xá-tre yomà°a,} y-a°ˆwa} áa¬7wa ""áni mìya.} ‘One or two days
after that they would come and fill them with water.’ (B5:77)
qím5le šqìla-ani.} ‘He took them.’ (A17:13)782chapter fifteen15.13.4. General Remarks Concerning Object Agreement
Taking into account all the various factors discussed above, it appears that
the basic motivation for object agreement is the existence of some kind
of prominence of the verbal predicate. The tendency for the agreement
to occur with definite direct objects rather than indefinite ones can be
correlated with a high degree of transitivity according to Hopper and
Thompson’s scale of transitivity (1980), in which ‘individuation’ of the
object is a factor bringing about high transitivity. This would also apply
to the exceptions to this rule with regard to definite objects that are
inalienable possessions of the subject and indefinite objects that play a
prominent discourse role, which may be interpreted as having a reduced
or enhanced degree of individuation respectively. This high transitivity can
be said to give the verbal predicate a higher degree of prominence. The
reduced likelihood of object agreement in verbal predicates that occur in
background clauses is due to the reduced prominence of the clause as a
whole due to its status in the discourse rather than the properties of its
components. Similarly, the lack of agreement with objects that constitute
a narrow focus arises from the consequential reduction in the prominence
of the verb relative to that of the object due to the pragmatic relation
between the object and the clause rather than the pragmatic property, i.e.
definiteness, of the object. The explanation for the increased tendency
for agreement to occur when the object is topicalized at the front of the
clause is likely to be that constructions with fronted topical constituents
are typically used as a strategy for disjoining in some way the clause from
what precedes in order to mark a boundary in the discourse (§17.7.2.3.,
§17.7.5.2.). The function of boundary marker gives the clause, including
the verb, a enhanced degree of prominence.
15.13.5. The Distribution of Compound Verbal Forms with ‘Heavy’ Pronominal
Objects
As remarked above (§15.13.1.), compound verbal forms express the pronominal object by L-suffixes or by pronominal suffixes attached to the
longer preposition ""6ll-. This is obligatory when the form does not have a
copula enclitic but optional when there is a copula enclitic. When an ""6llphrase is used with a form that has a copula enclitic, the form is longer
than one with an L-suffix. Most examples of such ""6ll- phrases combined
with copula enclitics that are attested in the text corpus occur with 3rd
person copula elements and their position is before the copula.","[819, 820, 821]"

the resurrection has come).’ (B5:54)
We should mention here a few isolated cases in which the interrogative
particle ""5ni is idiomatically translated as an indefinite pronoun or a relative
particle. These appear to have arisen by a blend between an interrogative
and another construction, e.g.
(24) ""àna} kut-dax-t-íla bràti,} b8y6n ""ˆni m7°ela.} ‘Whatever has happened
to my daughter, I want somebody to bring her back (I want—who
will bring her back?).’ (A27:18)

together with my horse (who has brought me?).’ (A26:22)
19.3. Subordinate Content Clauses
A variety of subordinate clauses that are embedded as components of
a higher clause will be brought together in this section under the broad
classification of ‘content clauses’. These function either as direct object
complements of a verb or are governed by clausal conjunctions consisting
of prepositions, adverbials and quantifiers. In a large proportion of cases
these subordinate clauses are introduced by the subordinating particle D,
though this is omitted in some circumstances. As is the case with relative
clauses, in this type of subordinate clause the enclitic copula is regularly
attached to the subordinating particle D at the front of the clause.
19.3.1. Direct Irrealis Complement
When a clause that is the direct complement of a verb expresses an event
that is unrealized, its verb is in the qa†6l or qa†6lwa form. The clause may
be juxtaposed asyndetically to the main verb or it may be connected to
it by the subordinating particle D. Some aspects of these constructions
have been described in §15.1.1.8. and §15.1.2.5. Here we shall restrict
ourselves to some remarks concerning the word order attested in irrealis
complement clauses of the text corpus.
When the complement clause contains a subject nominal, this is placed
before the verb and before the subordinating particle D, if this is used:syntactic subordination of clauses979(1) b8y6n ""álaha t-yaw•lli m•ndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
more.’ (A3:1)
(2) la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do not
want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed has
died.’ (A4:33)
A direct object nominal is placed in various positions. It is found after the
verb of the complement clause, e.g.
(3) b8yi t-áxli xa-ràmša.} ‘They want to eat dinner.’ (A2:2)
(4) b8y6n †alb•nna brátux †la-xòni.} ‘I want to ask for the hand of your
daughter for my brother.’ (A32:11)
It is sometimes placed before the verb of the complement clause and the
D particle but after the main verb. In such cases the object has topical
status due to its connection with what precedes (5) or due to its being set
up as a contrastive topic with another item in an adjacent clause (6):
(5) ""ána b8y6n ""ánna déwe maxênna.} ‘I want to attack these wolves.’
(A14:52)
(6) b8y6n mênnux} hélma t-yáw6t b-rèši} ""u-be-má'na †ízux yaw•tle l-gùda.} ‘I want
you to blow breath on me and—excuse me2—turn your bum to the
wall.’ (A25:12)
The object may also be fronted before the main verb. In the attested
examples of this the object is the complement of the particle ""ap and has
focal prominence, e.g.
(7) ""ap-b7°i b8y6t ßa†mêtle?} ‘Do you want to destroy my house as well?’
(A23:39)
(8) ""áp-xa la-qábl6t t-áw6r gu-bˆ°a.} ‘You should not allow anybody to
come into the house.’ (A23:25)
In (9) an irrealis clause stands in apposition to a demonstrative pronoun
that refers to the propositional content of the clause. The whole construction is presented in a single intonation group:2Literally: without meaning.","[1016, 1017, 1018]"
"896chapter seventeen(7) tàwra} primále ðá ""íðe dìye.} ‘The ox—he cut off one of its feet.’
(A22:3)
(8) Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye.} ‘Blind David—his father and
mother urged him.’ (A16:5)
An extraposed nominal is in principle definite with an identifiable referent.
In some cases the nominal has not been explicity mentioned, but its referent is referentially anchored in some way to a nominal in the preceding
context, as in (9), where the nominal ‘one room’ is a member of the set
of ‘two rooms’ mentioned earlier. The referent of the nominal may be a
class that is identifiable by its descriptive content alone (10)—(11):
(9) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
two rooms. In one room they slept. The other one was (for) the
animals.’ (A22:10)
(10) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘But a ladder—it is made of wood.’
(B10:60)
(11) kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a ""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle
dìye.} ‘Whoever brings me word about my son, whether he is dead
or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
When the referent of the fronted nominal has the role of direct object
in the clause, marked by a direct object pronominal suffix on the verb, as
in (12)–(15), its syntactic status is ambiguous. This is because there is a
general tendency for there to be a pronominal suffix on the verb agreeing
with a definite direct object constituent irrespective of whether the object
is placed before or after the verb (§15.13.2.1.).
(12) ""a-št7°a šat7wala t-lá mìya.} ‘They drink that drink without water.’
(B5:14)
(13) ""áy ""ilána mßaqlìwala.} ‘They decorate that tree.’ (B5:39)
(14) ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘We produced that drink there.’
(B5:11)
(15) ""o-qàmxa} m5°7wale bˆ°a.} ‘They would bring the flour back to the
house.’ (B5:16)
Although there is ambiguity on the level of syntactic structure, certain
object initial clauses possess the functional properties of extrapositional
constructions. This applies to the type of construction that has beenthe clause897referred to in §17.7.5.2. as ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses, in which
the object sets the topical frame for the clause. As we shall see, this is a
basic functional property of extraposition. It should also be noted that
the prosodic isolation of the initial object in a separate intonation group,
as in (14) and (15), is a feature common to ‘topic-orientated’ object initial
clauses and extrapositional clauses, but is rarely found in ‘event-orientated’
object initial clauses. ‘Topic-orientated’ object initial constructions with a
resumptive pronoun will be included together with extrapositional constructions in what follows.
17.8.1.2. Resumptive Element
The extraposed constituent is generally resumed in the clause by a
pronominal suffix. The suffix may be on the verb (1), a noun (2) or a
preposition (3):
(1) ""áw y-amríle xêppo.} ‘That—they call it a x6ppo.’ (B5:35)
(2) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
wood.’ (A12:39)
(3) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome.} ‘In our commuity a week is seven
days.’ (A17:13)
In some cases the resumptive element is an independent pronoun. In most
of the attested cases this is the subject of the clause, e.g.
(4) jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘The chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
(5) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse} ‘But a ladder—it is (made) of wood.’ (B10:60)
(6) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Only my eye, which saw
it—let that go to Hell.’ (A16:2)
(7) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has worked—he will eat.’ (A21:15)
Occasionally the independent resumptive pronoun is the object of the
verb, e.g.
(8) táma ""áti kut-b8y6t gór6t ""àw.} ‘There anybody you like—you can marry
him (= You can marry anybody you like).’ (A8:80)
(9) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was (some of the tobacco)
that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they threw that
away.’ (B7:17)898chapter seventeenThe resumptive element may even be a full nominal, e.g.
(10) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the cooking pot
became the mullah’s.’ (A5:10)
In (11) where the extraposed element is a generic relative phrase, the
resumptive noun has an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun:
(11) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)
In (12) an extraposed plural noun does not have any direct resumption,
but is linked to a singular noun in the clause in a set relationship:
(12) bàte} ""áxni qáßra díy6n mubnél6n šét6t xámši-w †¬à°a,} ""u-xámši-w ""àrpa.}
‘As for houses, we had our villa built in the year fifty-three and
fifty-four.’ (B1:20)
An extraposed item may be left without any explicit resumption in the
clause. In such cases the extraposed element sets the orientation of the
clause, similarly to a clause initial adverbial, without playing a syntactic
role in it.
(13) †alòbe,} béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ‘As for the betrothal—they would make
food.’ (B5:7)
(14) m5xólta y-áwa mbúšle qawúrma-w rêzza,} ""u-k6ftàne.} ‘As for the food,
they would have cooked qawurma, rice, meat-balls.’ (B5:15)
(15) palá††6t ""9raq,} t-amrèxi,} y-a°7wa m5°7wa lìne ""í°wa,} d5r7wa lìne,}
""u-d5r7wa mìya gáwa.} ‘As for the production of arak, as we would
say, they used to bring pots, they would put down the pots and
put water into them.’ (B5:12)
(16) sab-xlúla rába náše ‘5dˆwa.} ‘Because the wedding—they invited many
people.’ (B5:23)
A speaker sometimes extraposes the 1pl. independent pronoun in this way
when referring to activities in his own home or community.
(17) ""áxni b-sètwa mš7ra dúnye ràya} m6n-yárx6t ""êßra-w} xadèss6r hòd6x.} ‘We
(= in our community)—in winter it starts raining from October
and November onwards.’ (B5:145)the clause899(18) ""àxni} ""Ón-Núne npílta bel-†úra l-†ùra.} We—""“n-Nune is situated between mountains.’ (B5:148)
(19) ""áxni b7°6t be-bábi ""atìqa-wewa.} ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùlnaše.} ‘We—the house of the family of my father was old, but
it was higher than the villas of everybody (in our community).’
(B10:51)
In (20) and (21) the resumptive independent pronoun itself stands extraposed from the clause:
(20) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or anybody—he—they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
(A17:17)
(21) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—the three of
them—I have given them an appointment.’ (A22:21)
17.8.2. Function
17.8.2.1. Discourse Boundary Marking
The function of the extraposition of an item at the front of a clause is
in most cases to express some kind of boundary and reorientation in the
discourse. The initial nominal expresses the topic referent of the clause,
which often has topical status also in the following clauses. When the
initial topic is given added prominence by being prosodically separated
from the rest of the clause in a different intonation group, the degree of
disjunction from what precedes is in principle enhanced. As we have seen,
subject initial clauses and ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses also have
a disjoining function. In these constructions also the degree of disjoining
is enhanced by the prosodic separation of the initial topical constituent.
The subject constituent may be separated from the rest of the clause by
an intonation group boundary, e.g.
(1)
(2)šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
(B6:21)In copula clauses another type of prosodic separation of the initial subject topic constituent is its detachment from the copula, resulting in a900chapter seventeenconstruction such as (3). Example (4) has the same structure, with the
copula after the subject, without the prosodic separation:
(3) gèrðo ""íla m6n-màsta.} ‘G6rðo is (made) of yoghurt.’ (B5:64)
(4) xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)
It is worth noting that in some other NENA dialects, constructions that
correspond to (3) are extrapositional with an independent resumptive
pronoun attached to the copula, e.g. C. Qaraqosh:
(5) ""ójar ""áhu-l6 xa-mèndi d-gár6šl6 xmàra.} ‘The plough is something that
an ass pulls.’ (Khan 2002: 412)
The types of boundary that are expressed by extrapositional clauses in
the text corpus can be classified as follows:
(i) Beginning of Speech
A speaker often opens a speech turn with a topic referent that is accessible to the hearer. If this is not the subject of the clause, it stands in
extraposition, e.g.
(1) mère yêmmi} ""êdyo} †¬à°na} xon>wá°6t Qára Tè≥din} mopíš6lle l6bbèy.} ‘He
said “Mother, today the three brothers of Qara Te≥din—their hearts
became (angry).” ’ (A26:71)
(2) mèra ""áwwa náša f>qìra} t-awéle xá bronà.} ‘They said “This poor
man—to him will be a son (= he will have a son).” ’ (A8:3)
(3) mère xàli} xmàre,} šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwe.} ‘He said “Uncle, the
asses—the seven of them have been eaten by wolves.” ’ (A23:15)
(4) ßlélux xá-bena xèna?} gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘ “Have you
come down again?” “Your stupid club (literally: the club of your
behind)—would I have been finished off by it?” ’ (A52:17)
If the subject of the clause is a possession or attribute of the speaker or
hearer, the speech turn often begins with an extraposed 1st or 2nd person
independent pronoun respectively, e.g.
(5) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole.} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
(6) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
wood.’ (A12:39)the clause
(7)
(8)
(9)901""ána ""úrxi rába rìxt5la.} ‘I—my way is very long (= I have a long way
to go).’ (A8:42)
""áxni ""áti xà°6n-iw6t.} ‘We—you are our sister.’ (A34:16)
""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)The choice of extraposed pronoun to open the speech turn depends on
the topicality of the referent in the ensuing discourse. This is seen in (10),
in which the first clause opens with the 2s. pronoun although the grammatical subject is 1fs., since the following clauses are ‘hearer-orientated’,
containing various deontic expressions addressed to the hearer:
(10) ""áti ràba b>yánnux.} bas-msà'6dli xá‘‘a.} hálli xákma mêndi} masqánne l-bˆ°a}
""u-""aßèrta b-l7le ""á°eti kêsli.} ‘I love you a lot. Only, help me a little.
Give me something to take up to the house and tonight come to
me.’ (A22:19)
(ii) New Section of Discourse
On some occasions a construction with an initial extraposed topic referent
occurs at the onset of a section of discourse that is disjoined in some way
from what precedes. Various types of disjunction can be identified.
In (1) the extrapositional clause coincides with a shift in topic referent:
(1)xíllux táma mubsêmlux.} ""ána q6m-†arðìli.} ""è°y6n m-k7rbi hon-xíl6lla ""ày.}
‘You ate there and enjoyed yourself. I—they drove me out and,
out of my anger, I have come and eaten it.’ (A2:11)The construction is used when there is continuity of a topic referent from
the preceding discourse but disjunction on some other level. In narrative it
is used to signal the onset of an event section that is presented as separate
from the previous one:
(2)""ím6t pìdle †úra,} ßàle} ""êlt6x.} réša xtáya kúlle mêlx5le.} sùsux} ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela.} mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘When he has
crossed over the mountain, he will go down. Down hill it is all
salt. Your horse—(when) its legs have become wounded, salt will
strike his legs and he will screech.’ (A24:12)In narrative the construction is used at the onset of a section that supplies some kind of elaboration on what precedes rather than carrying the
narrative forward. In (3) it presents an event that is circumstantial to the902chapter seventeenpreviously mentioned event. The extrapositional clause in (4) provides an
evaluative comment on what precedes rather than an event that is presented as sequential to what precedes. In (5) the narrator opens a section
that shifts to a point earlier in the time-line and recounts the events that
led to the protagonist becoming blind.
(3) qíme dwíqe xá b-aw-rùše} xá b-aw-rùše} nùbl6lle.} ""áw lá snidíle ""áqle dìye}
q6m-nablìle.} ‘They held him, one this shoulder and one the other,
and took him away. His legs did not support him. They took him
away.’ (B9:24)
(4) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} xabúše muntéwala bíya dìya.} ‘They began to cultivate
apples. They were successful with apples.’ (B5:75)
(5) qám d-áyya qêßß6t} t-miràli} Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye} mèra
""èllahi magurêxlux.} ‘Before this story that I have told you (so far), the
blind David—his father and mother pressed him and said “By God,
we must marry you.” ’ (A16:5)
In (6)–(8), from descriptive discourse, the extrapositional construction
constitutes an explanatory supplement to what precedes:
(6) béna gu-d-á-dana m5°7wa štˆ°a.} ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘At
that time they brought drink. That drink—we produced it there.’
(B5:11)
(7) béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘They would make
food. The food—the family of the bride would make it.’ (B5:7)
(8) ""í°wa jawêtta.} jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘There was a chopper. The
chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
In (9) the construction is used in a clause that repeats the content of the
preceding clause as a strategy to introduce elaborative material:
(9) y-áz6xwa ""áxni zóre m†alèxwa kolàne.} koláne m†alêxwa gáwa.} mattèxwala
bé""e gu-ßawêlta.} ‘We would paint eggs. We young people would go
and play in the streets. The streets—we would play in them and
would put eggs in a shoe.’ (B16:5)
In (10) the construction coincides with a shift from a general description
of a habitual situation to the description of a specific event, which is
offered as an illustration:the clause903(10) yawíwala xà-mdi.} ""ána xmá°i xá-dawa z8ra mutt7°6lli gu-""íð6t xóni ""Ìsh6q.}
‘They would give her (the bride) something. I—my mother-in-law
put a yellow gold coin for me in the hand of my brother Ish6q.’
(B8:35)
An extrapositional construction is used after a presentative clause with
existential particles in (11) and (12). This is likely to be a strategy to mark
off the presentative clause with enhanced distinctness in order to give the
item presented added prominence:
(11) ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} †úra t-ásq6t bíye dìye,} kúlle skinyà°5le.} ‘There is a mountain. The mountain—you should go up it, it is all (covered in)
knives.’ (A24:11)
(12) ""ítl6n ""7n6t ""ùmra.} ""ay-‘ú-ga lá-q7†a-w lá-s6twa bárzi míya dìya.} trè ""5ná°a
""ítl6n.} ‘We have the spring of the church. It—its water never dries
up, in summer or winter.’ (B10:61)
Generic or proverbial statements, which have an inherent independence
and distinctness from the preceding context, may open with an initial
topic standing in extraposition, e.g.
(13) ""ó-t šawèrra šáwwa sêkke,} ða-q7°a gu-be-têkke} ‘He who jumps seven
stakes—(one stake) will hit him in his waist.’ (D2:1)
(14) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or
anybody—he, they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
(A17:17)
In clauses denoting an iterative action containing a constituent with a
universal quantifier, the quantified phrase is often made the topic of the
clause and placed in extraposition, e.g.
(15) kut-mêsta} xa-zága dáry6t bìya.} ‘Put a bell on every hair.’ (A27:8)
(16) kú-reš6t xúwwe °èle,} q6m-maxèle.} ‘He struck each head of the snake
that came (his way).’ (A24:40)
(iii) Opposition between Topics
In some cases the motivation for the extrapositional construction is to set
up an opposition or parallelism between two topic referents. Each topic904chapter seventeenreferent is placed at the front of the clause and stands in extraposition if
it is not the subject referent, e.g.
(1) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
""6štà-yomela?} ‘We—a week for us is seven days and a month is thirty
days. You—is your week six weeks?’ (A17:13)
(2) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
two rooms. One room—they slept in it. The other one—it was (for)
the animals.’ (A22:10)
(3) zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ""u-màsta} ""áxl6t mènna qrúšta díya t-la-xàrwa.}
‘The pittas—you should eat them without breaking them. The
yoghurt—you should eat it without the crust being spoilt.’ (A30:5)
(4) ""ína júllux hálla †làli.} ""u-xmártux t-átw6n ""àna l-xáßa.} ‘Your clothes—give
them to me. Your donkey—I shall sit on its back.’ (A6:8)
In (5) and (6) the extraposition of the topical subject constituent by means
of an independent pronoun is used to mark it off distinctly from a topic
of an adjacent clause:
(5) d>ráje t-kèp5la,} ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘Steps are made of stone, but
a ladder—it is made of wood.’ (B10:60)
(6) ""ánna qurðáye barzanàye} ""áni hóla jrà†a.} ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a.} ‘The Barzan
Kurds were slipping, but the Christians were not slipping.’ (B19:7)
(iv) Prominence of Clause
In some cases the main motivation for an extrapositional construction
with a clause initial topic is to mark it off distinctly from what precedes
in order to give it prominence, e.g.
(1) °éle xa-hambišàya.} hambišàya} ""ˆ-ga} xír5le bìye,} ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle!} ‘A
giant came. The giant looked at him. That man’s heart burst (with
fear).’ (A31:2)
(2) lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ""áxni har-xòn6n-it!} ‘We do not want
water or anything else. You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)
In (3) the extrapositional clause marks the climactic point of the discourse
section, the origin of the name of the church being the main point of
the narrative:the clause905(3) gu-d-ò-""umra} †ùmr6lle} ""u-bènyela ""úmra b-réše dìye.} ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye
Mar-Sàwa.} ‘They buried him in (the site of) that church and built the
church over him. They gave it the name of Saint Sawa.’ (B6:30)
17.8.2.2. Topic Referents Obligatorily Resumed by L-Suffixes
In certain clauses, an initial topic referent regularly stands in extraposition
and is resumed on the verb by an L-suffix. These include the following:
(i) ‘Naming’ Constructions with the Verb ""mr
(1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
(2) ""áyya y-amrèxla m>màðta.} ‘This—we call it baptism.’ (B6:8)
(3) ""áni xa†oryà°a y-amríla.} ‘They are called “washing-boards.” ’ (B19:9)
(ii) Possessive Constructions with the Existential Particle
(4) ßlí°5la bàxta} xzí°a qa-màlla.} málla ""ítle d6kkán6t ""aparù°a.} ‘The woman
went down (to the town) and saw the mullah. The mullah had a
shop of household goods.’ (A22:11)
(5) ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya.} ‘He has a room like this one.’ (A21:5)
(6) ""àxni} gu-""Ón-Nùne} ""ítl6n šèra.} ‘We in ""“n-Nune have a saint’s festival.’
(B5:72)
(iii) Clauses Containing Verbs with Impersonal Subjects
(7) "">wáha t-ile xóðe díye b>yéle bàxta.} ‘The man who is alone needs a
wife.’ (A27:7)
17.8.2.3. Narrow focus
In some cases the nuclear stress is placed on an independent pronoun
that resumes an extraposed nominal phrase. This puts narrow focus on
the referent. The construction is typically used when the nominal is a
long phrase, e.g.
(1) kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ""o-t-pàl6x} ""àw t-áx6l.}
‘Whoever does not work in this house will not eat food. Whoever
works—he (and not anybody else) will eat.’ (A21:13)
(2) qa-mó g8r6g ""áz6l kúlla páxri gu-nùra,} gu-jahànnam?} bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày
xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Why should all my body go to the fire, to
Hell? Only my eye that saw it—let it go to Hell.’ (A16:2)906chapter seventeen
17.9. Miscellaneous Clausal Particles17.9.1. n6mu/l6mu
This particle gives an expostulatory or hortatory sense to questions. When
used to introduce negative questions, which is its most frequent usage, the
question is equivalent in function to an asseveration, e.g.
(1) nèmu la-mèri-llux dày6‰,} mí°a dày6‰?} ‘Did I not tell you that he would
return (= indeed I told you . . .), that the dead would return?’
(A22:39)
(2) nèmu ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘At
the wedding of Gw6rg6s did not my aunt buy his cake and say
“(I buy it) for a beehive? (= indeed my aunt bought his cake . . .)” ’
(B8:29–30)
(3) nèmu la-""awðèxle ""áwwa †ùra} d>rajyà°a,} d>ràje,} t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?}
‘Should we not make for this mountain steps (= indeed let us
make . . .), so that we can go up the mountain?’ (A17:4)
(4) lèmu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} ‘Should I not go? (= indeed I should go)’
(A39:10)
(5) lèmu lax-xnìq6llux?} ‘Have we not drowned you? (= surely we have
drowned you)’ (A7:22)
Occasionally the most appropriate translation of the particle is ‘why?’,
e.g.
(6) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmu
la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)
The particle is occasionally used in positive questions, where it has a
remonstrating force, e.g.
(7) nèmu ""áyya bèrke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
you are swimming? (= surely it is mine not yours)’ (A25:61)
17.9.2. xo-/xuThis particle, which is related etymologically to Syriac k∫ar, is used most
frequently in negated clauses. When used in non-interrogative clauses, it
intensifies the negation, often with a remonstrating force, e.g.","[934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941, 942, 943, 944, 945]"
"CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE CLAUSE
17.1. The Copula Clause
Many aspects of the function of the various copulas and the clauses in
which they occur have already been dealt with at length in §8.7. The use
of copulas in the predicate of compound verbal constructions has been
presented in §8.8. Here we shall be concerned with some features of the
word order of copula clauses. The clauses are divided into three groups
according to the type of copula they contain: (i) enclitic copula (including
present and past copula), (ii) independent copula (including present and
past copula) and (iii) deictic copula.
17.1.1. Enclitic Copula
17.1.1.1. Basic Predicate
When the enclitic copula occurs in a clause consisting of a predicate
without any independently standing subject constituent, it is suffixed to
the predicate, e.g.
(1) xòðiw6n.} ‘I am by myself.’ (A22:32)
(2) xàwr6n-ile.} ‘He is our friend.’ (A14:61)
(3) zòr5le.} ‘He is young.’ (A25:87)
(4) senàyile.} ‘It is easy.’ (B5:106)
(5) ""5-gò‰t5la.} ‘She is the elder one.’ (A25:19)
(6) xa-""ilàn5le.} ‘It is a tree.’ (B5:152)
(7) qùwy5wa.} ‘It was strong.’ (B5:145)
(8) zàxme-wawa.} ‘It was huge.’ (C7:2)
When the predicate is a 1st or 2nd person pronoun, the copula agrees
with the predicate, e.g. ""àn5w6n} ‘It is me’, ""àti-w6t} ‘It is you’.
17.1.1.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent in the form of an independent pronoun or a nominal, the subject is normally placed before the824chapter seventeenpredicate and the copula is suffixed to the predicate with the nuclear stress
occurring on the predicate, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""ána màlk6n.} ‘I am a king.’ (A4:30)
""áwwa nišànq5le.} ‘It is a symbol.’ (B5:41)
bráta zamàrt5la.} ‘The girl is a singer.’ (A25:68)
xáli zàngin-ile.} ‘My uncle is rich.’ (A23:3)
w-áw xamìm5wa.} ‘It was warm.’ (B5:154)
xóne díye f>qìra-wewa.} ‘His brother was poor.’ (A25:1)When the predicate is a 1st or 2nd person pronoun, the copula agrees
with the predicate, e.g.
(7)""áni xášwi ""áti ""àn6n.} ‘They will think you are me.’ (A7:18)The subject constituent may occur in a separate intonation group. Constructions such as these often occur at some kind of boundary in the
discourse. The clause in (8), for example, opens a section of discourse
concerning the village saint’s festival. The clause in (9) marks the onset
of a concluding comment on the preceding foreground section of the
discourse concerning the cultivation of apples. The clause in (10) occurs
at the onset of a turn of speech:
(8)
(9)šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
""u-xayu°èy} b-àyy5wa.} ‘Their livelihood was in this (profession).’
(B5:106)
(10) ""ána-w ""àti} xon>wà°5w6x.} ‘You and I are brothers.’ (A26:49)
The copula is occasionally placed on the subject constituent. The motivation for such a construction is to express the prominence of the subject.
This may be focal prominence or topical prominence (§15.4.1.4.1. i–ii).
When it has focal prominence it functions as an information focus. This
is signalled on the prosodic level by the placement of the nuclear stress
on the subject constituent, e.g.
(11) ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog, you are a dog.’
(A11:20)
(12) dêbb5la táma} ‘The bear is there.’ (A20:7)the clause825In (11) and (12) the predicate belongs to the presuppositional background
of the clause. In (11), for example, the presupposition is ‘x is a dog’ and the
subject constituent supplies the new information that x is to be identified
with ‘you’. The clauses are used in a context in which the speaker assumes
that the hearer is entertaining another referent for the role in question
and the purpose of the construction is to reverse this expectation.
In (13) the construction is used to express an exclusive focus after the
particle har:
(13) lèmu har-àtit ""árya?} ‘Is it only you who are a lion? (literally: Only you
are a lion?)’ (A46:3)
When the subject constituent with the enclitic copula is topically prominent, the nuclear stress remains on the predicate. The topical prominence
of the referent arises from the fact that it has been evoked in the immediately preceding discourse. This construction is not regularly used with
all subject constituents that have been previously evoked. The purpose
of the ‘heavy coding’ of the initial topical subject is to mark a boundary
in the discourse, endowing the clause with a distinctness from what precedes. This may mark a new discourse section, as in (14) and (15), where
the clauses are concluding comments on a preceding foreground section.
The construction is also used to give a clause distinctness for the sake of
making it more prominent, as is the case in (16):
(14) ""áwwa mèšxa y-amrèxle óìta.} ""áwwa ""i-map6lxìle} ""èn y-axlíle b-lêxma,} ""èn
""i-d5ríle b-rêzza,} . . . ""áyy5la óìta.} ‘We call this butter óita. They use
it—either they eat it on bread or they put it in rice or, when they
cook rice . . . This is butter.’ (B6:40–41)
(15) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yawèlla yalêx°a ""èlli.} ""u-""áyy5la kùlla.}
‘The young man whom she loved has come and has given me her
scarf. That is all.’ (A4:24)
(16) xúwwele q†ìla.} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)
The topical prominence marked by the copula may also be forward
pointing, i.e. the item is marked as having relevance in the subsequent
discourse. This is found in constructions with the deictic form hatxa or
had6x ‘thus’, when it has a forward pointing correlative function in that it
relates to what is specified in the following clause, e.g.","[860, 861, 862, 863, 864]"
"924chapter eighteen18.1.4.1. Topical Function
The particle is often attached to a clause initial nominal or independent pronoun that has topical status, in that it has been referred to in the preceding
discourse and is the pivot for the new information of the clause. The
particle can be interpreted as enhancing the topical prominence of the
initial item. This reinforces the boundary marking function of the clause
initial topic. In most cases the initial topical item is the grammatical subject. This often constitutes a shift in subject referent from the preceding
discourse, as in (1–4). The clause may be sequential to what precedes
(1–3) or overlapping temporally with it (4):
(1) m•re yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu,} ‘ìdetu} ta-mšax•lpi š•mm6t ’ùxo} mattúle xá-š6mma
xèna.} ""ánna-≥i ""ê°yela.} xìlela-w} šêtyela.} ‘He said “Come, come, you are
invited” in order for them to change the name ’uxo and give him a
another name. They came. They ate and drank.’ (A7:3)
(2) dmìxela.} xá-bena xéta qìmela} qèdamta.} yála-≥ig6n qím5le f†ìr5le} mxúll6lla
pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘They went to sleep. Again they got up

his face and went to his work.’ (A21:16)
(3) qímela mšux•lpe b-jùlle.} ""awwá-≥i zìl5le.} ""5-kusí°a múßl6lla gu-""7ne díye t-’ùxo.}
‘They exchanged clothes. He (the shepherd) went and lowered the
hat of ’uxo over his eyes.’ (A7:19)
(4) mubsêmlux,} ˙uriyy?t.} w-ána q6m-maxˆli} w-áti xyára bìyi.} ""ána-≥i m-k7rbi

houris. But they beat me while you were looking at me. I, out of my
anger, came and put the chicken on the fire and ate it.’ (A2:10–11)
The particle occurs in constructions where two topics are set up in a
disjunctive opposition (‘either x or y’), as in (5), where the nuclear stress
occurs on the subject constituent since the lexical content of the verb is
given information:
(5) har-déwe t-axlìli.} har-t-áz6n gu-d-ànna hambišáye} har-hambišàye-≥i t-axlíli.}
‘(Either) the wolves are sure to eat me (or) I shall go to these giants
and the giants are sure to eat me.’ (A39:4)
In some cases the subject constituent continues that of the preceding
discourse, but the construction nevertheless marks a boundary on some
other level of the discourse. In (6), for example, the clause ""áwwa-≥i q•ry6llaclause sequences925(‘He called to them’) marks the onset of a section where the protagonist
engages directly with the inhabitants of the town, whereas in what precedes he surveys the scene:
(6) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} x•zy6lla náše
jêmye} qúrb6t qáßr6t màlka,} kút-xa mßawó°e xà-m6ndi,} kút-xa mára xà-m6ndi.}
""áwwa-≥i q•ry6lla m•re mòdila q•ßß6t?} ‘In the end God made him come
across the town where the daughter of that king was. He saw the
people gathered near the palace of the king, each one saying something, each one telling something. He called to them and said “What
has happened?” ’ (A4:11)
If the clause with the initial topic is negated, it may stand in an adversative relationship to what precedes, e.g.
(7) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ""u-""áxni-≥i láx muqíme m-bá°re díye
màlka.} ‘On the day he left, his son died. But we have not installed
(another) king after him.’ (A4:32)
18.1.4.2. Focal Function
When the particle is attached to a nominal constituent that is in focus it
has the inclusive sense of ‘also’ or ‘even’. The focused item, which may
occur anywhere in the clause, generally takes the nuclear stress, e.g.
(1) ""ána hadíya m-kêsl6n °áya.} ""u-b8ye ""á°e xazèlux} ""u-qa-t xazéla bràta-≥i.} ‘I
am now coming back from him and he wants to come to see you and
to see also the girl.’ (A4:24)
(2) ""u-b-l7le t-yánne xa-bàxta-≥i} ‘And at night I shall give him also a
woman.’ (A14:63)
(3) ""ítle t8ra gu-˙adìqa} ""u-""ítle dàrga-≥ig6n.} ‘There was a door in the garden
and there was also a main gate.’ (A17:23)
(4) ""6n-háwe dàwa-≥i} ""áxni t-yaw•xla xa-b-†¬à°a ""•lle díye.} ‘Even if it is gold,
we shall give him threefold (if it is lost).’ (A7:10)
On a few occasions the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere in the intonation group, e.g.
(5) d•ry6lla š-qaràw6t,} ""ánna wajjúwe díya-≥i mútt6lla tàma.} ‘They put her on
the bed and they also put her effects there.’ (A21:7)926chapter eighteenThe particle is occasionally attached to a verb in order to express the climax
of a sequence of events. This may be regarded as a focal inclusive function,
marking explicitly that the verb is to be included in the sequence, e.g.
(6) síq5le šqílle xa-kèpa} mútt6lla ""àxxa} kalêb°a,} q†ìl6lla,} dêry6lla,} mqulêbz6lla≥i.} ‘He went up and took a stone, put the dog here, killed it and
(finally) turned it upside down.’ (A30:20)
18.1.5. ""ina
The basic function of this particle is presentative, i.e. it draws attention to
something. The item to which attention is directed may be a referent or a
proposition. The contexts where it is most commonly used are as follows.
18.1.5.1. In Association with Verbs of Perception
It is used in narrative after a verb of perception, usually ‘to see’, to introduce what is perceived. In this context it introduces a proposition rather
than a referent and so is equivalent to the English complementizer ‘that’.
The proposition typically denotes a state or an imperfective progressive
activity rather than a perfective action. The clause that expresses the
proposition generally lacks a copula element, e.g.
(1) ""•°yela xêzye} ""ína †éna kúlle á•¬ya šêxta.} ‘They came and saw that the
saddle bag was completely full of filth.’ (A7:11)
(2) qím5le plì†a} x•zya ""ína b7°6t Qára Té≥din qàða.} ‘He went out and saw
that the house of Qara Te≥din was burning.’ (A26:53)
(3) xzéli b-xêlmi} ""ìna} ""ána zíla l-pardˆsa.} ‘I saw in my dream that I went
to Paradise.’ (A2:7)
(4) qímela zíle x•zye ""ína d°s.} ‘They went and saw that it was true.’ (A14:13)
(5) xár°a tfíqe bíye x•zy6lle ""ína šênya,} npìla.} ‘Then they came across him
and found that he had fainted and fallen.’ (A14:88)
In (6) a construction of this type is followed by a negated construction
with the verb of perception and the presentative particle gapped after
the negative particle la. The ""ina before the la in the negative construction
here has an adversative function (see §18.1.5.3.):
(6) xzèla} ""ína núra †•pya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là b5°a-qíða.} ‘They saw that fire
had been kindled in his house, but not that his house had burnt
down.’ (A48:3)clause sequences927Occasionally the complement clause has a deicitic copula in addition to
the presentative particle, e.g.
(7)wíra x•zya ""ína kúl-xa m5xólta hóla mbušle wíðe hàz6r.} ‘He went in and
saw that all kinds of food were cooked and made ready.’ (A14:29)The particle is sometimes used before a verb of perception. This construction is used when the complement of the verb is an object referent
rather than a proposition, e.g.
(8)pa°êxle t8ra,} ""ína xazéle ""o-""a≥vána tàma.} ‘He opened the door and
saw the caretaker there.’ (A22:43)
(9) l•xma p°ìxle} ""ína xáze ""•sri ""•óóa lêxme.} ‘He opened (the basket of ) bread
and saw that there were twenty-nine loaves of bread.’ (A17:12)
(10) ""á°ya gàšqa} ""ína xazyála Lelì°a.} ‘She comes and looks. She sees
Leli°a.’ (A19:8)
(11) qédamta qím5le xále dìye,} ""ína x•zy6lla ""án ""askaràye.} ‘The next morning
his maternal uncle got up and saw those soldiers.’ (A25:79)
(12) S6ttíye xðìrt5la} ""ína xzì°6lle.} ‘S6ttiye searched and found him.’ (A25:37)When the complement of the verb ‘to see’ is a proposition the subject
of the proposition is sometimes raised into the position of direct object
of the verb. In such case the presentative particle is placed either after
the verb (13–14), which is characteristic of constructions with proposition
complements, or before the verb, which is characteristic of those with
referent complements (15):
(13) xazéle ""ína b7°e áê¬ya.} ‘He sees that his house is full.’ (A21:8)
(14) ""ím6 t-ìn prám6lle,} xzáy6n na°yà°e} ""ína t-h5wàne.} ‘When I was slaughtering it, I saw that its ears were those of animals.’ (A23:39)
(15) ""ína q6m-xaz•nn6x ""áti rába hawnànta.} ‘I have seen that you are very
clever.’ (A40:16)
On some occasions the particle is used to introduce something that is
perceived without the explicit expression of a verb of perception. What
is perceived may be a proposition or a referent. If it is a proposition, this
usually denotes a state or progressive activity, e.g.
(16) qímela mbádla nàše} ""an-mar>wá°a ""ína ""6rwéy kúlla npíle twíra qðalèy.} ‘In
the morning the people, the owners (of the sheep), got up (and
saw) that they had all fallen and broken their necks.’ (B18:7)928chapter eighteen(17) wídle hàtxa,} ""ína kúlla †rì°a.} ‘He put (his hand here) like this (and
felt it) was all wet.’ (A18:30)
(18) mátti bála gu-yàma,} ""ìna} ""a-súst6t yamà°a} nabòl6lla} ’6lk9ze.} ‘They
looked at the sea (and saw) the mare of the seas taking away
’6lk>ze.’ (A12:34)
(19) ""án-naše kúlla xìrra bíye díye} ""ína qur†án6t xmáre tàma.} ‘All the people
looked at it (and saw) that asses’ blankets were there.’ (A23:15)
Note that a 3rd person pronominal subject has zero expression in (20)
and (21):
(20) ‰ìš5le} màlka} ""ína gu-‘à‘ma.} ‘The king woke up (and saw) that he
was in the bathroom.’ (A17:27)
(21) báxte díye xá-bena knàša-wawa,} xírta hátxa †úw6t ""isêq°a,} ""ína bdìla!}
‘While his wife was sweeping, she looked at the diamond of the
ring and saw that it had changed colour!’ (A18:25)
In (22) it is used before a clause containing a q†ille verb form denoting
an event that took place at a point immediately preceding the act of
perception:
(22) m•ra ""Øx ya-""alàhi!} b-xšáw6n gáw‰i °èle.} p°íxle t9ra.} ""ína °èle.} ‘She said
“Oh, my God! I think my husband has come back.” She opened
the door (and saw that) he had come back.’ (A39:18)
The perceived item may be a referent, e.g.
(23) ""o-xabúša p°ìxt6lle,} ""ína ""is•q°a dìya.} ‘She opened up the apple and
(saw) her ring.’ (A4:19)
(24) qím5la bàbi,} šqíl6lla xon>wá°e díye ""ò-parša} d-o-ma©àra,} ""ína xa-mar•gla
gò‰a} á•¬ya dàwe.} ‘He set off, my dear, and his brothers took off the
flat stone, of that cavern (and they found) a large pot full of gold
coins.’ (A39:15)
(25) p°íxt6lla ""ína kúlla dàwe.} ‘She opened them (the bags) and saw all
the gold coins.’ (A39:20)
When a nominal is followed by an non-restrictive attributive description
the construction can sometimes be interpreted as a referent or a proposition. This is particularly the case when the noun is definite in status and
so is suitable for functioning as a clause subject, e.g.","[962, 963, 964, 965, 966, 967]"
"20introduction
Kurdish
p-‘ak ‘armed’
p-hawas ‘happy’C. Barwar
b-šrara ‘truthful’
b-xamme ‘worried’(v) In both the C. Barwar and Kurdish dialects the copula verb ‘to be’ is
expressed by an enclitic that is inflected for person and number like
a verb. Although there are signs of the emergence of such a clitic in
earlier Eastern Aramaic, its full development and acquisition of verbal
inflection are apparently due to the influence of Kurdish:
Kurdish
C. Barwar
aw kurd-a ""aw qurðay5le (< qurðaya-ile)
‘He is Kurdish’
tô kurd-ì
""ati qurðay5w6t (< qurðaya-iw6t) ‘You (ms.) are Kurdish’
Kurdish inflectional morphological material is occasionally incorporated
into Aramaic words. This is the case, for example, with hypocoristic vocative forms of names. In the C. Barwar dialect these take the endings -o and
-e, the latter being characteristic of female names (§20.2.22.), which are
the Kurdish inflectional endings of vocatives (MacKenzie 1961: 156).
In some cases there is a convergence of the phonetic form of an item
in the NENA dialect with a corresponding item in Kurdish without there
necessarily being a borrowing of morphological material. Such phonetic
convergence is found, for example, in the demonstrative pronouns. In
C. Barwar there are three categories of demonstrative, viz. near to speaker,
in the distance, and absent. The Kurdish dialects of the region not only
have the same tripartite demonstrative system but also have demonstrative
pronouns of a strikingly similar form. Those from among the sets listed
by MacKenzie (1961: 174) that are of the greatest similarity are shown in
the following table. Despite this resemblance, the pronouns in C. Barwar
can be explained as having an internal Aramaic etymology (§7.4.):
C. Barwar
""awwa
"">waha
""aw‘this (ms.)’
‘that (ms.) over there’
‘that (absent)’Kurdish
awa
awèhè
awThe verbal system of C. Barwar and the NENA dialects in general has
undergone fundamental changes from what is found in the earlier literary forms of Aramaic. The two finite verbal forms of earlier Aramaic,
known as the suffix conjugation (q†al) and the prefix conjugation ( yiq†ol,introduction21liq†ol, niq†ol ) have been completely replaced by participles, which have
acquired verbal properties and verbal inflection. Broadly speaking, the
erstwhile active participle serves as the base for verbal forms expressing
present and future tenses or the past tense with an imperfective aspect
whereas the erstwhile passive participle serves as the base of past tenses
with a perfective aspect.
Several features of the verbal system that is found in C. Barwar have
parallels with Kurdish and must be considered to be contact induced.
These include the ergative type of construction of the perfective past verbal
base q†il-, whereby past actions are expressed by a passive construction
with the patient being presented as the grammatical subject rather than
by an active construction with the agent as the grammatical subject (§8.3.),
e.g. baxta q†ila-le ‘He killed the woman’ (literally ‘The woman was killed
by him’). This type of ergative construction with perfective past verbs,
which is common to the whole NENA group, has parallels in Kurdish
(MacKenzie 1961: 193–194). Another innovation of C. Barwar, which is
found only in a subgroup of NENA, is the use of a compound construction consisting of the combination of an originally passive participle q†ila
(referred to in this grammar as the resultative participle) and the verb ‘to
be’ to express the perfect (§15.4.1.). Again, this appears to have arisen by
influence from Kurdish, which has a parallel type of compound construction (MacKenzie 1961: 187–189).
It is important to observe, however, that there are some differences
between the C. Barwar dialect and the local Kurdish dialects in these
two verbal forms. In Kurdish the ergative type construction of the past
perfective with the patient of the action being the grammatical subject
and the agent expressed by an oblique agentive phrase (‘by X’) is naturally
restricted to transitive verbs. In the C. Barwar dialect and most other
NENA dialects, however, the ergative type of inflection with an agentive phrase (‘by X’) expressed by the preposition l- has been extended
by analogy to intransitive verbs, e.g. qim-le ‘He has risen’. This has not
happened in Kurdish or any other Iranian language in the NENA area.
In fact, in some Iranian languages the precise opposite has happened,
namely the active intransitive construction with the verb agreeing with
the grammatical subject has been extended by analogy to the transitive
past conjugation. This is the case, for example, in Modern Persian. The
extension of the ergative inflection to intransitives seems, rather, to be a
development internal to NENA. Vestiges of the original system in which
the ergative inflection is restricted to transitive verbs has survived in a22introductionfew Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery of the NENA area (e.g.
J. Sulemaniyya, J. Kerend and J. Sanandaj).32
Another difference between C. Barwar and Kurdish is the fact that in
C. Barwar the compound perfect construction is not ergative. The grammatical subject of transitive verbs is the agent rather than the patient. In
Kurdish, on the other hand, the corresponding compound construction,
which appears to have been the model for the NENA construction, is
ergative in form when the verb is transitive. The loss of the ergative inflection in C. Barwar and most other NENA dialects is again a development
internal to NENA. The original ergative type of construction has survived
only in a few Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery.33
These developments suggest that the influence from Iranian on the
Aramaic verbal system must have had a considerable time depth. In fact,
traces of ergative inflection of past tense verbs is found in Aramaic as early
as the 5th century B.C. and also in the main literary languages, Syriac,
Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic and Mandaic, in the first millennium A.D.
This must have arisen by contact with earlier forms of Iranian, such as
Old Persian and Middle Persian, where ergative constructions are found.
It is significant that in Classical Syriac texts a number of cases are found
where the ergative inflection is used with intransitive verbs, e.g. qìm l-eh
(Nöldeke 1904, §279). This is presumably the result of interference from
the vernacular and shows that the analogical extension of the ergative
inflection to past intransitives had taken place many centuries ago in the
vernacular.34
The influence of Arabic on the C. Barwar dialect is largely restricted to
the lexicon (§20.1.2.2.) and has not had a discernible effect on the phonological and grammatical structure. In the twentieth century the speakers of
C. Barwar were immersed in an Arabic speaking environment, both due
to their residence in the Iraqi towns and also due to the use of Arabic in
schools. The fact, however, that Arabic influence has not penetrated the
grammatical structure of the dialect in the same way as Kurdish and its
Iranian predecessors suggests that this intensive contact with Arabic is a
relatively recent phenomenon. Indeed many of the Arabic loanwords that
are established in the lexicon entered the dialect through Kurdish rather
coming directly from contact with Arabic (§10.11., §20.1.2.2.).","[58, 59, 60, 61]"
"the syntax of verbs655If the actionality of the verb is telic, the resultative participle can have
both a verbal and an adjectival interpretation. In the verbal interpretation, the predicate expresses the telic event including both its dynamic and
final static endpoint, the subject of the clause being either the agent or
the experiencer of the event. In the adjectival interpretation, it expresses
only the resultant state of the endpoint. Verbs of this nature falling into
the category of achievements, according to the classification described
above, include, for example, ""tw ‘to sit down’, kly ‘to stand up’, †l"" ‘to go
to sleep’, dmx ‘to lie down, go to sleep’, rkw ‘to mount (an animal)’, m†y
‘to arrive’, npl ‘to fall down’, pq"" ‘to split’, sps ‘to rot’, ""ßy/ßy"" ‘to get stuck’,
gðl ‘to become frozen’:
(1) ""áw hóle tìwa}
(2) ""áw hóle †lìya}
(3) ""áw hóle npìla}‘He has sat down’ (verbal)
‘He is seated’ (adjectival)
‘He has gone to sleep’ (verbal)
‘He is asleep’ (adjectival)
‘He has fallen’ (verbal)
‘He is (lying) fallen’ (adjectival)The adjectival function of the resultative participle of such verbs is demonstrated by the fact that it can function as an attributive modifier of the
participant that is affected by the event, i.e. the subject noun, e.g.
(4) ""aw-náša hóle tìwa}
xzáy6nne ""aw-náša tìwa}
(5) ""aw-yála hóle †lìya}
xzáy6nne ""aw-yála †lìya}
(6) ""aw-yála hóle npìla.}
xzáy6nne ""aw-yála npìla.}‘The man is seated’
‘I see the seated man’
‘The child is asleep’
‘I see the sleeping child’
‘The child is (lying) fallen’
‘I see the fallen child’Furthermore the adjectival interpretation of the copula predicate is shown
by the fact that it can be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’ in cases
where the resulting state is not permanent, e.g. héš hóle tìwa} ‘He is still
seated’, héš hóle †lìya} ‘He is still asleep’.
The category of telic achievements include various verbs that denote
ingressiveness into a state. The subject of these is typically an experiencer
rather than an agent, e.g. pßx ‘to become merry’, xðy ‘to become happy’,
krb ‘to become angry’, my° ‘to become dead, die’:656chapter fifteen(7)""áw hóle xêðya}(8)naša x6ðya
""áw hóle mì°a}
naša mi°a‘He has become happy’ (verbal)
‘He is happy’ (adjectival)
‘A happy man’ (adjectival attribute)
‘He has died’ (verbal)
‘He is dead’ (adjectival)
‘A dead man’ (adjectival attribute)Various telic intransitive verbs have a dynamic component with some
degree of quantifiable durativity and so should be classified as accomplishments, although in some cases the subject is inanimate. These include,
for example, m-qrn ‘to grow up’, m-nty ‘to succeed’, r°x ‘to boil’, ómó ‘to
wither’, qry ‘to study (i.e. to apply one’s mind purposefully to the acquisition of knowledge), be educated’:
(9)bróni hóle mq5rêna}brona mq5r6na
(10) míya hóla r°ìxe
miya r°ixe
(11) ""áw hóle qêrya}
naša q6rya‘My son has grown up’ (verbal)
‘My son is grown up’ (adjectival)
‘A grown-up son’ (adjectival attribute)
‘The water has boiled’ (verbal)
‘The water is boiling’ (adjectival)
‘Boiling water’ (adjectival attribute)
‘He has studied’ (verbal)
‘He is educated’ (adjectival)
‘An educated man’ (adjectival attribute)If the resultative participle in an intransitive clause is from an atelic verb,
which by its nature does not express an event with an inherent resultant
state, only a verbal interpretation is possible. The participle does not function as an adjective expressing a state, as shown by the fact that it cannot
serve as an attributive adjectival modifier of the affected participant of the
event nor can it be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’. Attested atelic
intransitive verbs include those classified as activities and statives.
Activity verbs include, for example, zmr ‘to sing’, bxy ‘to weep’, spr ‘to
wait’, plx ‘to work’:
(12) ""aw-náša hóle zmìra}
*naša zmira
(13) ""aw-náša hóle plìxa}
*naša plixa‘The man has sung’ (verbal)
‘The man has worked’ (verbal)the syntax of verbs657Punctual activities include such verbs as tp° ‘to sneeze’, m-tnx ‘to sigh’
(14) ""aw-náša hóle tpì°a}
*naša tpi°a
(15) ""aw-náša hóle mtùnxa}
*naša mtunxa‘The man has sneezed’
‘The man has sighed’Stative verbs include, for example, zd"" ‘to fear, be afraid’:
(16) ""aw-náša hóle zdìya}
*naša zdiya‘The man has feared’The resultative participle is combined with the copula also in the predicate
of transitive clauses, which contain an argument in addition to that of the
subject. In such constructions the participle always has a verbal interpretation. The participle and the copula agree with the subject, e.g.
(17) ""aw-náša hóle dwíqa bàxta.} ‘The man has seized a woman.’ (verbal)
Perfective transitive events are typically telic, in that they result in a state
which constitutes an inherent endpoint. The affected participant in the
event is generally the goal of the action, in (17) ‘a woman’, rather than
the subject referent. A resultative participle can only be used adjectivally
when it is a predicative or attributive adjective of the affected participant
of a telic event. It follows that the participle can be used adjectivally in
a passive construction such as (18), in which the affectee of the event is
subject. This is shown by the fact that it can be combined with the adverb
heš ‘still’, which can only be used in relation to states, e.g.
(18) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}
‘The woman is seized’ (adjectival)
""ay-báxta héš hóla dwìqta} ‘The woman is still seized’ (adjectival)
""ay-baxta dwiqta
‘The seized woman’ (attributive adjective)
Such passive constructions can also have a perfective verbal interpretation, e.g.
(19) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}‘The woman has been seized’658chapter fifteenThe agent is optionally expressed in a phrase introduced by the preposition l- or m6n. This can be used both when the participle has a verbal
interpretation and also when it is adjectival, e.g.
(20) ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key has been made by Baz
people’ (verbal)
""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key is made by Baz people’
(adjectival)
qðila mturßa l-baznaye ‘A key made by Baz people’ (adjectival attribute)
In transitive clauses such as (17) the resultative participle and the copula
agree grammatically with the subject of the clause, which refers to the
agent, rather than the object, which refers to the affectee, so only a verbal interpretation is possible. Furthermore, the grammatical agreement
with the subject, which is the agent of the event, forces the participle to
be interpreted with an active rather than passive voice. This active interpretation is further demonstrated by the fact that pronominal objects are
expressed by attaching L-suffixes, which are used elsewhere to express the
pronominal object of active verbs, e.g.
(21) ""aw-náša hóle dwìq6lla} ‘The man has seized her’
cf. ""aw-náša b-dawêqla} ‘The man will seize her’
The behaviour of the resultative participle in the various structural configurations discussed above may be summarized in the table below:Intransitive telic

Transitive active
Transitive passiveFunctionGrammatical agreementVerbal/adjectival
Verbal

Verbal/adjectivalGrammatical subject

Grammatical subject
Grammatical subjectThe following historical development of the construction may be hypothesized. The resultative participle was originally an adjectival form qualifying the affectee of an event, denoting the resultant state of the affectee
in a telic intransitive event or a transitive event. When used predicatively
an ambiguity developed between the interpretation of the function of the
construction as the expression of the resultant stative property (adjecti-the syntax of verbs659val) or the verbal event that brought about the state (verbal). The verbal
interpretation was extended by analogy to intransitive atelic predicates,
which do not result in any state and could not by themselves provide the
semantic basis required for the formation of the resultative participle. It
was also extended by analogy to transitive active predicates. The feature
of agreement with the grammatical subject was extended by analogy
from the original intransitive/passive construction to the transitive active
construction.
Regarding the copula component of constructions with the resultative
participle, this can be either the deictic copula or the basic copula. As
has been shown in §15.3.1.–§15.3.2., one of the conditioning factors for
selecting one particular type of copula is the nature of the predicate.
The enclitic basic copula and the deictic copula are used with predicates
expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent
basic copula is used only with predicates expressing permanent properties
that, typically, are intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have
not been acquired. It follows that it is in principle not appropriate to use
the independent copula with the resultative participle, which, whether
adjectival or verbal, expresses an acquired property of the subject. There
are sporadic exceptions to this principle, such as (22), where the speaker
appears to have used the independent copula in order to present the

‘Don’t you know that she has been betrothed to me since before
she was born? She is my wife.’ (A25:39)
15.4.1.2. Function in Non-Narrative Discourse
We shall now examine in greater detail the function that these resultative
constructions have when used verbally.
It is important to make a distinction between its usage in narrative texts
and its usage in non-narrative discourse.
In non-narrative discourse the resultative form is used to denote the
result of a past verbal event that is in existence in the present. It is generally appropriate to translate it with the English present perfect. The deictic
copula is used with the participle to draw particular attention to a current situation. There is a certain amount of subjectivity in the use of
the deictic copula, but it is generally employed in assertive clauses to
draw attention to a resultant state that has some kind of relevance to the660chapter fifteenimmediate present moment in time, e.g. hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’. In interrogative clauses the enclitic copula is used, e.g. ""6°y5le? ‘Has he come?’ The
construction is negated in both assertions and questions by the negative
copula, e.g. l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’, l5le ""6°ya? ‘Has he not come’.
The expression hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’ denotes that the subject has the
property of ‘having come’, which is the result of a prior event of coming.
It asserts the existence in the present of the result of an event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result.
Therefore, without further specification by a time adverbial in the clause
or by the discourse context, the statement hole ""6°ya denotes that he has the
property of ‘having come’ as a result of some unspecified event of coming
that occurred some time in the past. There is no restriction on when the
event occurred other than that it was some time before the present. The
q†ille form,6 by contrast, refers directly to a specific event in the past and
not to its result. The event has typically occurred in the recent past and
this may extend up to the present moment. The expression dìya °éle} ‘He
has come just now’ would be used to assert the occurrence of a specific
event that has just taken place. Likewise the q†ilwale form °ewale denotes
the occurrence of a specific event in the more remote past.
It may be the case that the result of the actions of q†ille and q†ilwale
have some kind of relevance in the present. This is especially the case
with regard to q†ille, which, in conversational discourse, is often translated
most appropriately with the English ‘perfect of recent past’.7 Such resultant present relevance is, however, an implicature of their use rather than
a component of their meaning. As remarked, the endpoint of an event
expressed by q†ille may be the present moment. The q†ille form °ele ‘He
has come’ would be used by a speaker when he sees a person walking
through the door of his home and the greeting said to the visitor on his
arrival would be b-šˆna °élux!} ‘You have come in peace!’ The resultative
form refers to a resultant state that holds at a period that is not adjacent
temporally with the endpoint of the event. The resultant state is disconnected from the event temporally in that the resultative form is typically
used after some time has elapsed after the event, crucially when none of
the event can be witnessed directly. The resultative form hole ""6°ya ‘He has
come’, for example, would be used when a guest is sitting in the house
6
For the sake of conciseness we shall dispense with noting in all cases the fact that the
q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa forms are suppletive variants of transitive perfective q†ille and
q†ilwale forms when pronominal suffixes are added.
7
For this type of English perfect see Comrie (1976: 60).","[693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698, 699]"
"874chapter seventeen(1) ""u-šwíqle zúze díye táma zìlle.} °éle xa-xèna,} ""an-zúze šqilíle ""u-zìlle.}
‘He left his money there and went off. Another man came, took
the money and went off.’ (A15:15)
(2) yála °éle m6n-zrùta,} táwre m5ríle gu-gòma.} ""u-síqle ta-t-áx6l mêndi.}
‘The young man came back from his cultivating, put the oxen in
the basement stable and went up to eat something.’ (A21:8)
(3) ja-jálde qìm5le} ""u-zíla šqíl6lle ""o-q7sa rìxa} ""u-wír5le gu-d-o-bˆ°a} r6š-dò-dapa} ""u-t8ra óêmt6lle báre.} ‘He quickly got up, took the long
stick and entered the room, by the board. She closed the door
behind him.’ (A22:27)
(4) mère mo-t-òð6x?} p5rmèxle ""o-zòra} t-axlêxle,} hal-""7-g6t t-áza dèbba m-tàma.}
qímela ""o-zóra prìm6llela} ""u-xìl6llela.} ‘He said “What shall we do?
Let’s slaughter the young one and eat him, (and wait) until the bear
goes away from there.” They slaughtered the young one and ate
it.’ (A20:7–8)
The construction is also used to express close spatio-temporal cohesion
of habitual events in descriptive discourse, e.g.
(5) mar6x°ìla,} ""u-""i-šoqíla t>màha,} míya ""i-†7pi b-rèša.} míy6t †7pi b-réša
b5zìla.} ‘They boil it and put it aside. The water comes to the top.
They pour off the water that comes to the top.’ (B6:42)
The cohesion may be one of total overlap, in that the clause is a reiteration of what precedes. Although in such cases the clause is strictly not
sequential to the preceding narrative, it often acts as a link between what
precedes and a subsequent series of sequential clauses, e.g.
(6) ""u-dwíqt6lle ""ixála gu-‘ánte dìye,} jarrèta y-amrèxla.} jarréta dwìqt6lla}
""u-másta gu-bùrra-w} drí°6lle gu-‘ánte dìye.} ‘She packed food in his
bag—we call it a jarreta (‘lunchbag’). She packed the lunchbag, (put)
yoghurt in a pot and placed it in his bag.’ (A21:11)
The construction is sometimes used in clauses that are logically cohesive
with what precedes in that they express the cause or the evidence for it,
e.g.
(7) ""áp-xa lì° láxxa gu-b7°a.} ""ayále díye hóle mšùdr6lla xa-dúk°a
xéta.} ‘There is nobody here in the house. He has sent his children
to another place.’ (A22:28)the clause
(8)875mère qa†lênnux.} mère q†ùl!} lìtli.} zúze làn-x6zya.} ‘He said “I’ll kill
you.” He said “Kill (me). I have not got it. I have not found the
money.” (A15:4)’The preposed object in such event-orientated constructions may be a
non-referential negative expression that has no anaphoric connection with
what precedes, e.g.
(9)kùt-yum} ßaléwa gàw‰a} l-šùqa} msawòqe} ""u-‘ú-m6ndi l7 m5°èwa.}
‘Every day the man would go down to the market to do shopping,
but would bring nothing back.’ (A22:1)
(10) kúl-xa náša ßày6m.} ßày6m,} hí‘-m6ndi lá-""ax6l †¬à yománe.} ‘Everybody should fast. (Everybody) should fast and should not eat anything for three days.’ (B6:19)
When the construction is topic-orientated, the initial object is set up as
a topic that is the main centre of concern in the clause. This strategy is
used at the beginning of a section of discourse, in which the referent of
the preposed object often retains its central topicality in what follows. The
fronted referent is often a newly introduced referent, e.g.
(11) xèlya mar6x°ìle} ""u-šoqíle p7ša d8raj ˙>rára díye taqríban ""àrbi.} d7ri
marè°a bíya.} ‘They boil milk and let its heat become about forty
degrees. They put rennet in it.’ (B6:37)
(12) sá‰e xašlèxwala b-xašòlta.} ""u-mpart6nêxwala} ""u-qašrêxwala.} ‘We
would crush barley in a mortar. We winnowed it and removed the
peel.’ (B10:12)
(13) xá-m6ndi t-amrànn5xu.} x†í°i b-quðalˆxu} bnóni qam-""7ni là qa†lítula.} bá°6r qa†lìtuli,} xéna ""ap-bnòni qa†lítula,} b-gòti qa†lítula.} ‘I say to
you one thing. I implore you, do not kill my children before my
eyes. After you kill me, then kill also my children, kill them by my
side.’ (B9:13)
(14) ""íðux lá-dar6t gu-nùra} t-là-""aqða.} ‘Do not put your hand in the fire,
lest it burn’. (D2:8)
In some cases the newly introduced referent is not explicity referred to
in the following clauses, but nevertheless it has some kind of relevance
in what follows. In (14), for example, the lamp is needed to see the girl
asleep. In (15) the living room is required to accommodate the guests on
their return. The object ""urxa ‘way’ in (16) is closely linked semantically876chapter seventeenwith the following clause, which should be analysed as its complement
(‘the way she learnt’):
(15) xa-lámpa m7°6t b-""ìðux,} ""u-háyyo láxxa kêsli.} xzìg6n} ""áyya bráta šapìrt6
t-íla dmíxta kêsli.} ‘Bring a lamp in your hand and come here to
me. Look at this beautiful girl who has fallen asleep with me.’
(A26:5–6)
(16) mur-†la-Zìne} kú‘ke mtag6bràla,} ""áxni dì‰‰6n} la-mßél6n síql6n ßˆda.} ‘Tell
Zine to prepare the living room. We have returned, we could not
go out hunting.’ (A26:46)
(17) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""èlla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)
The initial object that is set up as the topic of the clause may be a generic
relative phrase, e.g.
(18) kú-m6ndi b8y6t šqùl.} ‘Take whatever you want.’ (A22:17)
(19) kú-m6ndi-t ""amrènnux g8r6g ""òð6t.} ‘Everything I say you must do.’
(A14:66)
The construction is used in direct speech where the referent has topicality
due to its presence in the speech situation, e.g.
(20) ""áyya bràta} hox-mú°y6lla †làl6x} †la-brònux.} ‘We have brought this girl
for you, for your son.’ (A21:6)
(21) t-yánnux ""6ßrà dináre.} bàs} ""áwwa náša nablètle †amrêtle.} ‘I shall give you
ten dinars. Only, take away this man and bury him.’ (A22:37)
When two or more such topic-orientated constructions are juxtaposed,
they are presented as two parallel situations without being connected
sequentially, e.g.
(22) ""ap-šúl6t banjáne har-hàd6x ""awðíwale.} ""ap-šúl6t xiyáre hàd6x ""awðíwale.}
‘They carried out the cultivation of aubergines in the same way.
They carried out the cultivation of cucumbers in the same way.’
(B7:13)
(23) †¬á-bnone xilìli.} báxta xilàli.} ‘I have eaten three sons. I have eaten
the wife.’ (A20:12)
(24) ""í°wali xa-kàrma.} zrìy6nwale} mútta-wewa dalyá°a ""u-xabúše ""u-kúl xamêndi.} mútta-wewa ""ixàla.} °éle xa-náša q6m-šaqèlle ""o-kàrmi.} lá-karmithe clause877l5le-m>dò‰e} ""u-la-˙áqq6t kàrmi l5le-yáwa.} ‘I had an orchard.
I had cultivated it. It was laid out with vines, apple-trees, everything. It was laid out with food. A man came and took away my
orchard. He does not return my orchard nor does he pay the price.’
(A17:30)
The topic-orientated construction with a fronted object may be juxtaposed
with a clause with an initial subject, which has the same effect of expressing parallel situations rather than sequentiality, e.g.
(25) mèšxa páy6š xòðe,} ""u-dáwwe d5r7la gu-xa-qußxáne gò‰ta.} ‘The butter
remains by itself and they put the yoghurt water in a large pot.’
(B6:40)
The constructions discussed above should be distinguished from constructions with a fronted object that is an information focus marked by the
nuclear stress, e.g.
(26) A: xzéli bàbux} B: là,} màmi xzélux.} ‘A: “I saw your father.” B: “No,
you saw my uncle.” ’
(27) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
“Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
a peach. He has not eaten an apple.” ’
In such cases the remainder of the clause belongs to the presuppositional
background, i.e. it is assumed to be known to the hearer. What is unknown
is the identity of the argument in question. In (25) the presuppositional
background of the clause with the fronted object is ‘You saw x’ and in (26)
it is ‘My brother has eaten x’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the new
information that he is conveying, is the identity of x in each case. Note
that in clauses with compound verbal forms, the copula is attached to the
fronted object. Examples from the text corpus (see §15.4.1.4.1 i):
(28) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I
did not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of
his sister.’ (A8:85)
(29) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
(A24:31)878chapter seventeenThe fronted object in focus may be introduced by an inclusive or restrictive particle (‘also, only’), e.g.
(30) ""ap-mêlxa piðále.} ‘He passed by also the salt.’ (A24:19)
(31) mèri qa-yêmmi} bas-mìya mátt6t qam-réša díya.} ‘I said to my mother
“Place only water by her head.” ’ (A21:37)
The inclusive particle ""ap is also used with initial object constructions that
have the nuclear stress on the verb and so do not express narrow focus on
the object but rather a broader focus on the proposition as a whole, e.g.
(32) hot-ß†ìm6lle b7°6t xálux.} ""ap-b7°i b8y6t ßa†mêtle?} ‘You have ruined
the house of your uncle. Do you want to ruin also my house?’
(A23:39)
(33) ""úp Mar-Sáwa q6m-talêxle.} ‘He also destroyed (the church of) Saint
Sawa.’ (B6:33)
(34) béna ""àw} ma-t-íwa hal-hàd6x,} b>yéwa qa-""alàha} ""u-""aláha b>yèwale,}
""ap-míya muklèle gu-d-5-sálla.} ‘He was so (holy), he loved God and
God loved him, that he could even hold water in the basket.’
(A16:10)
17.7.6. Double Objects
In constructions that take two direct object nominal constituents these are
normally both placed after the verb, e.g.
(1)
(2)""áxni šaqlèxxe ""u-áá¬6xxa ‘ántux zùze.} ‘We shall take it and fill your
bag with money.’ (A39:14)
madoqíla xètna-w k yálo got6-©ðàðe} ‘They make the groom and bride
hold each other’s side.’ (B5:50)The first object constituent may be fronted before the verb in contexts
where single object constituents are fronted. In (3), for example, the
fronting of the object ‘his bag’ occurs in a clause that is intended to be
cohesive with what precedes in a close temporal sequence. In (4) the object
is fronted in a topic-orientated construction that is presented as parallel
with what precedes:
(3)wídla ""ixàla} †la-yàla.} xìlle.} ‘ánte díye dwíqla zwàðe.} ‘She made
food for the youth. He ate. She packed his bag with provisions.’
(A21:22)the clause879(4) t-óð6n ""ixàla,} xá""a m6n-d-ánna kúbbe gò‰e.} xá""a †la-xmà°ila} ""u-xá †la-gàw‰i.}
""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme,} t-yánna xa-†làlux} ""u-xá †law9zìr.} ‘I’ll make food, one of these big meat-balls. One is for my
mother-in-law, one is for my husband. The one that is for me I’ll
make into two parts and give one to you and one to the vizier.’
(A21:28)
17.7.7. Subject—Object—Verb
Occasionally the object is fronted before the verb when the clause has an
initial subject constituent. Most attested cases of such constructions have
independent pronouns as subject, e.g.
(1) mère yába b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} mère zílla °èla} ða-""àqla!} ""áti
""áqla šqùlla} ‘He said “Will you sell it to me if it has one leg?”
He said “All this fuss (literally: they have gone, they have come),
now one leg! Take the leg.” ’ (A22:5)
(2) t-óð6n ""ixàla,} xá""a m6n-d-ánna kúbbe gò‰e.} xá""a †la-xmà°ila} ""u-xá †la-gàw‰i.}
""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme,} t-yánna xa-†làlux} ""u-xá †la-w9zìr.} . . . ""ána
sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu} ""ána lè-y-axl6n.} ‘I’ll make food, one of these
big meat-balls. One is for my mother-in-law, one is for my husband.
The one that is for me I’ll divide into two parts and give one to
you and one to the vizier. . . . I shall give my share to you. I shall
not eat.’ (A21:28–29)
(3) sóg6n m7°o xárj-u bárj6t botanàye} ""u-""ána xá°i t-yánna †la-M9mo.}
‘Go and collect the taxes of the people of Botan and I shall give
my sister to M>mo.’ (A26:73)
In all cases the object is anaphorically bound to the preceding context
and the clause is semantically cohesive with what precedes. As we have
seen, clause initial subject pronouns are in principle used to signal some
kind of disjoining from what precedes, so there appears to be some tension here. The main motivation to use the subject pronouns seems to be
to give prominence to the clause as a whole.
17.7.8. Independent Object Pronouns
Occasionally an independent pronoun or anaphoric demonstrative pronoun is used to express a pronominal direct object. It is placed either before
or after the verb. This construction is found in the following contexts.","[912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 918]"
"the syntax of verbs727With regard to the subject referent of an infinitive, this is in principle
either explicitly expressed together with the infinitive or, if not expressed,
it is the continuation of the subject referent of the preceding clause. An
exception to this is where the infinitive has an impersonal subject. This
is seen, for example, in (1), in which the infinitive †>ya has an impersonal,
unspecified 3pl. subject, which is not the subject of the preceding clause.
This infinitive, moreover, is the first of a sequence of two infinitives, the
preceding clauses having q†ille form verbs. The plural resultative participles
in the following clauses demonstrate that the subject of the infinitive is
3pl.:
(1) pílle šnèle.} †8ya bá°re díye la-xzày6lle.} xár°a tfíqe bíye xèzy6lle ""ína šênya,}
npìla.} ‘He fell and fainted. They searched for him but did not find
him. Then they came across him and found that he had fainted
and fallen.’ (A14:87)
In addition to narrative sequence, the infinitive is used in the contexts
described below. When the infinitive lacks the verb ‘to be’ in these contexts, it is still treated as a verb with regard to its syntactic relation to the
participants in the clause. The subject and direct object are combined
with the infinitive as they are with verbs, the infinitive never being linked
to these clausal participants by nominal annexation with the particle D.
15.5.2. Temporally Overlapping Activity
The infinitive may be used to express an activity that was being performed
at the same time as that of the preceding verb. If the subject of the infinitive is the same as that of the preceding verb, the infinitive is normally
used without any pronominal subject, e.g.
(1) xa-núra ""è°y5le b-lˆle} ""ax-""áxxa sàqa.} ‘A light came in the night, coming
up right here.’ (A29:23)
(2) ""àw} šaqèlla gána Bakúrko ràqa,} ßàle} k6s-M9mo.} ‘He, Bakurko, took
himself off running and went down to M>mo.’ (A26:78)
(3) xz7g6n xòn6x} ""u-M8mo t-íla tíwe m†awóle b-s6tr6njàne.} ‘See your brother
and M>mo who are sitting playing chess.’ (A26:64)
(4) síqle l-bˆ°a} pšìma-w} bxáya mxáya l-gáne dìye} bnóne díye t-la-""ixàl5la.} ‘He
went up to the house, sad, weeping, beating himself (thinking that)
his children would be without food.’ (A22:7)728
(5)chapter fifteen
xa-béna ""è°y5le xa-""aqúbra xàß-sùsa,} ma†ròye,} ""u-lwíša júll6t xumàla,} ""uma†róye xàß-súse dìye,} pyáða táma tàma.} ‘Then a mouse came on the
back of a horse, riding, dressed in fine clothes, riding on the back
of his horse, passing by.’ (A35:4)In such contexts the infinitive is generally negated by the particle t-la
‘without’, e.g.
(6)(7)
(8)
(9)máxe zórna xa-salíqa xèna,} ""èrbe b-dˆri,} b-g yanèy,} t-la-m>dó‰e la-š>vàna}
""u-la-""àp-xa.} ‘He played another tune on the pipe and the sheep
returned, by themselves, without a shepherd driving them back or
anybody.’ (A25:27)
zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ‘You should eat the pittas without
breaking them.’ (A30:5)
""áni xè††e huwèdi sáma zóda} ""i-z>ríla t-là maštóye.} ‘The huwedi wheat
they generally sow without irrigating.’ (B5:94)
q6m-dárila ""an-dáwwe heš-t-là bráza,} xán‘i t-la-bráza m5°íwa xa-gèlla
y-amríle sêrmo.} ‘(When) they have poured out the dawwe while it is
not yet dry, shortly before it becomes dry, they would fetch a herb
called s6rmo.’ (B14:1)In (10), from a poetic passage, a finite verb rather than an infinitive is used
after t-la, in order to rhyme with the end of the preceding clause:
(10) xámši yóme ßimìla} qurbáne t-la qriwìla.} ‘She fasted for fifty days without
taking communion.’ (A37:4)
The infinitive construction is also used when it has a different subject
from that of the preceding verb. In such cases the subject is expressed by
a nominal or independent pronoun, e.g.
(11) xèzy6lla náše jêmye} qúrb6t qáßr6t màlka,} kút-xa mßawó°e xà-m6ndi,} kútxa mára xà-m6ndi.} ‘He saw the people gathered near the palace of
the king, each one saying something, each one telling something.’
(A4:11)
(12) sìqt5la.} ""áy hár mšeyðòne} šwára nðáya gu-d-án ""otáxe šluxˆ°a.} ‘She (the
old woman) went up (to see her). She (the princess) is continually
acting madly, leaping and jumping around naked in the rooms.’
(A4:17)the syntax of verbs729(13) w-ána q6m-maxˆli} w-áti xyára bìyi.} ‘They beat me while you were
looking at me.’ (A2:10)
Again, the infinitive is generally negated by the particle t-la ‘without’,
e.g.
(14) qím5le jálde madènxa t-la-mxàya.} ‘He rose early while the dawn was
not breaking (= before dawn broke).’ (A8:51)
We have seen that also the infinitive with the deictic copula can be used to
express an event that overlaps temporally with that of an adjacent clause
(§15.4.2.3.). In principle this expresses a greater degree of independent
duration. The infinitives in the foregoing examples, by contrast, are typically more closely knit with the activities expressed by the adjacent verbs
with a lesser degree of independent duration.
In the foregoing examples the infinitive supplies a further description of
the event. In some cases the infinitive may have an epexegetical relationship
to a preceding clause, in that it supplies further explanatory information
that is necessary for its interpretation. This applies to the following:
(15) ""ána wídli spayù°a,} maxzóy6llux dàwa.} ‘I did a kindness by showing
you the gold.’ (A10:12)
(16) ""áwwa mò-t>h6r náš5le?} là-""amr6tti?} zála škáya ""êlli?} ‘What kind of
person is he (’ixalo)—won’t you tell me?—going complaining
about me?’ (A25:31)
(17) qa-mòt hátxa wáða bíyi,} m5°óye dwáq6lla ""ùrxi?} ‘Why have you done
this to me, bringing (snow) and blocking my road?’ (A25:42)
An infinitive may be used in a clause preceding the main clause, expressing an activity or situation that was in existence when the event of the
main clause took place, e.g.
(18) ""ánna kút-dan6t jrà†a,} suráye dwaqêlla.} ‘Each time they slip, the Christians grab them.’ (B19:7)
(19) ""áni xyàpa,} zíl5le yàwna} zdí°6lle l5ka-S6ttìye.} ‘While they were bathing,
the dove went and threw it by S6ttiye.’ (A25:72)
(20) ""áxni plá†a gu-bˆ°a,} b8y6x †8y6x xá-m6ndi t-àxl6x,} hóla xzáy6ll6n qá†u
ráqa bá°r6n xàl6ll5ni.} ‘(When) we go out into the house and search
for something to eat, the cat sees us, runs after us and eats us.’
(A44:1)730chapter fifteen(21) š-lá-praqa ""o-pék dìye} ""o-xáwri hád6x gabbàra,} xáz6x wírre gawàye.} ‘(While)
my friend, who was a huge man, had not yet finished his measure
(of whiskey), we saw him go inside.’ (B15:58)
Also in these contexts an infinitive with a deictic copula may be used.
The difference again is that the copula makes the clause less tightly knit
with the adjacent clause and presents it as having a greater degree of
independent duration.
15.5.3. Cognate Infinitive
On some occasions a finite verb is combined with an infinitive from the
same root and stem. Such infinitives are placed either before or after the
verb. The general purpose of this construction is to give prominence to
the verbal predicate. It is found in a variety of different contexts.
The verbal predicate is sometimes given prominence in order to set it
in contrastive opposition to a situation mentioned in the adjacent context,
e.g.
(1) ""áwwa b7°a x>làla-wewa} bás ""áyya †ása dàwa} gnàwa-wawa gnúta.} ‘That
house was pure, but the bowl had been stolen.’ (A15:18)
(2) kusì°a,} har-""àm‰a-wewa,} gamríwa gmàra.} ‘A hat was only wool. They
pressed it (they did not knit it).’ (B10:50)
(3) ""ína bróna lˆla xílt6lle.} har-nobált6lle mutt7°6lle mattòye.} ‘But she did not
eat the boy. She had just taken him and put him down.’ (A19:7)
(4) b-q7†a lá-mß6x doqêxle,} ""6lla-q†ála qa†lìwa náše.} ‘In summer we could
not catch them, but rather people would kill them.’ (B5:147)
The construction is used when the situation described is deemed by the
speaker to be unexpected in the context, e.g.
(5) ""ap-q†ála b>yènwa qa†lênwale.} ‘I even wanted to to kill him.’ (A1:17)
(6) ""7-ga lánwa brì°a ""ána bráya.} ‘At that time I was not even born.’
(B8:5)
(7) práxa prìxle?} ‘Has he flown away?’ (B9:6)
In many cases the cognate infinitive is used with a verb denoting an action
that has particular importance. This is often reflected also by the repetition
of the verb within the section of discourse in question, e.g.","[765, 766, 767, 768, 769]"
"258chapter eightWhere both the stem I and the stem II form are used without direct
objects, the semantic difference between the two can in some cases be
identified as relating to the degree of control of the action by the grammatical subject. This applies, for example, to
xmala ‘to enjoy oneself ’mxamole ‘to put on festive clothes’It can be said that in the activity of putting on smart clothes in order to
become festive (mxamole) the subject is the agent of the action and has
control over the action. In the event of ‘enjoying oneself ’ (xmala), on the
other hand, the grammatical subject is less of a controlling agent and
often may be simply an experiencer of the event. Agency of the grammatical subject and control of the action by the agent are parameters
that increase the transitivity of the verb according to the Hopper and
Thompson model.
There are, nevertheless, several pairs of stem I and stem II forms that
do not express any identifiable difference in meaning or transitivity, e.g.
bðara ‘to scatter’
dwara ‘to thresh’
graóa ‘to scratch’
jraga ‘to snatch’
ngara ‘to tear bite from bone’
npaša ‘to tease (wool, cotton)’
pšama ‘to be sad’
qrawa ‘to approach’
qwara ‘to bury’
sxaya ‘to swim’
šðaya ‘to card (wool, flax)’
šra†a ‘to escape’
ßlaxa ‘to split (wood)’
tlaxa ‘to destroy’mbaðore ‘to scatter’
mdawore ‘to thresh’
mgaroóe ‘to scratch’
mjaroge ‘to snatch’
mnagore ‘to bite meat from bone’
mnapoše ‘to tease (wool, cotton)’
mpašome ‘to be sad, regret’
mqarowe ‘to approach’
mqawore ‘to bury’
msaxoye ‘to swim’
mšaðoye ‘to card (wool, flax)’
mšaro†e ‘to escape’
mßaloxe ‘to split (wood)’
mtaloxe ‘to destroy’It is possible that the stem II form of these pairs originally expressed
enhanced transitivity due to such features as the iterativity of the action,
e.g. npaša ‘to tease’ vs. mnapoše ‘to tease repeatedly’, šðaya ‘to card’ vs.
mšaðoye ‘to card repeatedly’, ßlaxa ‘to split’ vs. mßaloxe ‘to split repeatedly’,
the energy input of the subject, e.g. sxaya ‘to bathe’ vs. msaxoye ‘to swim’,
or the degree of affectedness of the subject, e.g. pšama ‘to be sad’ vs.","[296, 297]"

17.7.14.2. Negative Particle before Other Constituents
The negative particle is sometimes placed before another component of
the clause that intervenes before the verb. This is found in the following
circumstances:
(i) Verb Not in Scope of Negation
One context where this is found is where the scope of the negator
includes this item but not the verb. In order for it to be within the scope
of the negation, it must be in the focus component of the clause. There
is, therefore, a narrow focus on the negated item, with the verb being in
the presupposition. The nuclear stress is sometimes, though not regularly,
placed on the negator before the item in narrow focus, as in (1)–(4):
(1) xzèla} ""ína núra †èpya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là-b5°a qíða,} xá‘‘a q7se rè˙qa m6nbˆ°e.} ‘They saw that fire had been kindled in his house, but his
house had not burnt down, only a few sticks far from his house
(had burnt).’ (A48:3)
(2) ""è°yela hìw6lla} ""áy mèra lˆk6t naból6lli?} mère ""ána làn †láli naból6ll6x.}
naból6ll6x †la-d-áwwa dewêrr6š.} ‘She said “Where are you taking me?”
He said “I am not taking you for myself. I am taking you for this
vagabond.” ’ (A12:35)
(3) là-kulley yapáwa.} ‘Not all of them used to bake.’ (B5:17)
(4) ""áx‘i là gu-""Ôn6 Núne q6m-""oðènne ""éða,} q6m-""oðènwale gu-Dòhok.} ‘But I did
not spend the festival in ""“n-Nune, I spent it in Dohok.’ (B15:9)
(5) lá kulla-náše y8ði t-oðìla.} ‘Not all people know how to make it.’
(B10:22)
(6) ""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ‘We do not use it much.’ (B10:18)
(7) ""ilan5ni t-xabušta. m-reša-w š6tta mnoqašta. l-Yaws6p zwinta b-dabašta. nèmu
""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘ “Our
tree is an apple tree. It is decorated above and below. It has been
bought by Yaws6p for a beehive.” [wedding song] At the wedding
of Gw6rg6s was it not my aunt who bought his cake and say “(I
buy it) for a beehive?” ’ (B8:29–30)
(8) xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man.’ (A26:79)892chapter seventeenConstructions such as (9) and (10), in which the verb has been gapped,
can be included here:
(9)""áni maßlèxwa ""êrxe,} †axnêxwala.} là kúlla náše.} bas-""àxni.} ‘We brought
them down to the water-mill and ground them. Not everybody,
but we did (this).’ (B10:88)
(10) mattátla xa-kawáz6t míya k6s-réša-w bàs,} la-""ixàla,} la-lêxma.} ‘You should
put out for her a jar of water by her head and that’s all, not food,
nor bread.’ (A21:10)In (11) the item in the scope of negation is placed after the verb, with the
negative particle used both before this item and the verb:
(11) lá d5r7le là r6š-séla} ""i-maxíle gu-tanùra.} ‘They do not place it on a
griddle, they place it in the oven.’ (B6:49)
(ii) Constituents Coordinated in a Set Relation
The negative particle is placed before a subject constituent when the latter
is placed at the front of a clause in order to establish it in a set relationship
with an item in a coordinated adjacent clause and the scope of negation
includes the subject, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)la-k yàsa m>ráwa} ""u-la-xàßa m>réwa,} la-∂á©a† y-awèwale.} ‘(One’s) stomach did not ache, (one’s) back did not ache and one did not have
(high blood) pressure.’ (B5:31)
""ána lˆ-gor6n,} la-""àti gáwr6t.} ‘I shall not marry, so long as you do not
marry.’ (A25:83)
la-""áxnix xàla} ""u-lá sus>wà°6n xála.} ‘Neither are we eating nor are
our horses eating.’ (A26:16)If the items that are coordinated in a set relationship across a series of
two or more clauses are not subject constituents, a second negator is often
placed before the item in question, in addition to a negator in the normal
position in the clause, e.g.
(4)lá-karmi l5le-m>dò‰e} ""u-la-˙áqq6t kàrmi l5le-yáwa.} ‘He does not return
my orchard nor does he pay the price.’ (A17:30)Constituents that are coordinated in this way include the resultative participle and infinitive of compound verbal constructions, e.g.","[929, 930, 931]"
"838chapter seventeenWhen an adverbial interrogative expression meaning ‘why’ is placed at
the front of a copula clause, the copula is, likewise, attached to this item
rather than to the predicate, e.g.
(14) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is this town like this?’ (A4:31)
17.1.5. Existential Usage
In a few cases the enclitic copula is used simply to predicate the existence
of a referent rather than ascribe some property to it or identify it with
another item. This is most commonly found in meteorological expressions, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)xapù°5la.} ‘It is foggy (literally: There is fog).’
mê†r5la.} ‘It is rainy (literally: There is rain).’
xêmm5le ""èlli.} ‘I am hot (literally: There is heat is to me).’
qàr°5la ""èlli.} ‘I am cold (literally: There is cold is to me).’Other examples:
(5)
(6)
(7)gu-xa-gèppa hambišàye-wawa.} ‘There were giants in a cave.’ (A12:18)
há ríx6t náša naxrày5le!} ‘Ha, there is the smell of a foreign man!’
(A24:47)
""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} ‘While there was flour on her hands,
she opened the door.’ (A21:26)In principle the nuclear stress is placed on the existential subject in such
constructions, which reflects its status as a new information focus. In (8)
the copula is placed on a preceding quantifier. In such constructions the
whole clause is a new information focus, including the existential subjects,
which is reflected by the position of the nuclear stress on the subject at
the end of the intonation group. The placement of the copula on the
quantifier, therefore, does not express a narrow new information focus on
the quantifier, but rather expresses a prominence or intensification of the
quantifier within the broad information focus of the clause:
(8)""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""á°‰a.} ráb5wa tàlga} ráb5wa mè†ra ""u-m6ndiyàne.}
‘(The month of ) February was very bad in our country. There was
a lot of snow. There was a lot of rain and so on.’ (B5:152)the clause839Sporadically the enclitic copula is found with an existential function with
referentially definite subjects in other contexts, e.g.
(9)har-W7rda-w Nˆrgis-ila.} làtla,} lá bnòne,} lá ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Only W5rda
and N5rgis were there. They had no children, nothing.’ (A24:51)The independent copula is attested with existential meaning in clauses
contaning indefinite subjects, e.g.
(10) gu-d-ó qotíya ""íla xa-ßêpra.} ‘In that box there is a sparrow.’ (A12:40)
The deictic copula is used existentially with definite or indefinite subject
constituents. It is placed either before or after the subject, e.g.
(11) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
(12) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)
(13) xa-b7°a hòle.} ‘There is a house over there.’ (A33:5)
17.2. Clauses Containing a Negative Copula
The negative copula is in principle placed before the predicate. The most
basic construction consists of a simple nexus of copula and predicate, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)l7le dàwa.} ‘It is not gold.’ (A14:26)
l7le póìla.} ‘It is not crooked.’ (A17:20)
l7le gnàyi.} ‘Its not my fault.’ (A23:23)
l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this country.’ (A25:82)
l7wa rába gò‰a.} ‘It was not very big.’ (B5:140)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally placed
before the predicate, e.g.
(6) ""áwwa lˆle qáša.} ‘He is not a priest.’ (B17:7)
(7) ""áw l7le ""ùpri.} ‘It is not my land.’ (A25:52)
(8) Yuwán6s lˆle táma.} ‘Yuwan6s is not there.’ (A52:6)
(9) dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
(10) yèmmi l7wa qrì°a.} ‘My mother was not educated.’ (B8:15)840chapter seventeenThe nuclear stress is placed either at the end of the predicate phrase or on
the copula. It is typically placed on the copula when the predicate consists
of an item that has been introduced in the preceding discourse, e.g.
(11) mère má-l6x bráta t-it-hátxa bxàya} qam-d-ánna ""êrwe?} mèra ""ánna lˆwa
""èrwe,} xon>wà°i w7wa.} ‘He said “What is the matter with you girl
that you are weeping so much in front of these sheep?” She said
“These used not to be sheep, they used to be my brothers.” ’
(A34:20–21)
(12) mère mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} . . . mèra ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He
said “What dog have you given birth to?” . . . She said “He is not
a dog. You are a dog.” ’ (A11:20)
(13) ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ""áwwa mì°5le.} ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,}
""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.} ‘They say that he has
no relatives. He is dead (in this case). So long as he had a wife,
he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’ (A17:17)
The subject constituent is sporadically placed after the predicate. As with
positive copula clauses with postposed subjects, this construction is used
to express close cohesion to what precedes. It is found in contexts such
as (14), in which the clause is a comment that is presented as a tag to the
preceding remark and not the onset of a new discourse section. Note that
the subject is in a separate intonation group:
(14) hot-q†ìl6lle ""a≥vána!} mêre} lˆle ""a≥vána} ""àwwa.} (She said) “You have killed
the caretaker.” ’. He said “He is not the caretaker.” ’ (A22:46)
The negative copula is placed after the predicate in idiomatic interrogative
constructions such as (15) and (16). In these an interrogative clause with
a negative copula echoes a preceding interogative clause with a positive
copula, maintaining the same word order:
(15) dréla šláma l-f9qih} dàx-it?} dax-lˆw6t?} ‘She greeted the jurist “How
are you? How are you not?” (A22:16)
(16) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla.} ‘If he is my
nephew, he will come and will know what these are and what they
are not.’ (A25:49)the clause841This echoing of the word order of a preceding constituent question with
a positive copula is also found in the answer to such questions, as in (17),
in which the negative copula in the answer is placed after the predicate:
(17) ""àm6r,} Fárxo †la-xále díye ""àm6r} xáli mòdila?} xáz6x ""askaràye.} kúlla ""Amedía
píšla ""askaràye.} mère xá-m6ndi lˆla.} ‘He said, Farxo said to his maternal
uncle “What is the matter uncle? We can see soldiers. The whole of
Amedia has become soldiers.” He said “It is nothing.” ’ (A25:79)
The 3fs. form of the negative copula l5la is tagged onto the end of clauses
in various contexts to refer to some general propositional content, e.g.
(18) b8z6xwa tannêkka.} tannèkka t-nù†a l7la?} ‘We would make a hole in
the can, an oil can, is that not so?’ (B10:86)
(19) kèma gàye} gu-xáßa díya mútte tópe ‘Æruk,} lˆla.} ‘Several times the guns
were pointed at her back, bang, but it does not happen (i.e. the
gun does not shoot).’ (B9:18)
The negative particle la is occasionally used in a clause containing a positive copula in order to express asseveration rather than negation. In such
cases the negative particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.
(20) la-hóle mì°a.} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
(21) la-""aw-d°s-wewa.} ‘He was indeed right.’ (A17:8)
(22) la-málka màmi} hóle yèmya b-rèši.} ‘Indeed the king my uncle has sworn
on my head (to execute me).’ (A25:36)
(23) la-""àxxa-wewa.} ‘He was indeed here.’
Such constructions have no doubt developed from the use of the negator
as an interjection to contradict some statement or request of the interlocutor, as is seen in contexts such as (24):
(24) mère ßli-qàm°a} mère la-""àti ßli-qám°a.} ‘He said “Go down and
meet her.” He (the other) said “No, you go down to meet her.” ’
(A26:40)842chapter seventeen
17.3. The Existential ParticlesThe existential particles (""i°, ""i°wa, li°, li°wa and their variants) are placed
either before or after the nominal with which they are combined.
17.3.1. Particle—Nominal
In most constructions with the positive existential particle that are attested
in the text corpus the nominal is placed after the particle. The function
of such constructions is to introduce into the discourse new referents,
which have not been mentioned previously. The nominal in most cases is
indefinite with a specific referent, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)""í°6n xa-†ùra.} ‘There is a mountain.’ (A24:11)
""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘There was a king.’ (A1:2)
""í° xa-párša b-réše dìye.} ‘There is a flat stone on him.’ (A39:13)
""í°6n táma ðà""a.} ‘There is a woman there.’ (A25:53)In some cases the nominal denotes a generic class or is a proper name.
Both of these types of nominal are definite in status, since their referent is identifiable from their description independently of context. The
crucial feature, however, is not identifiability but rather the fact that they
have not been mentioned previously and are being introduced into the
discourse, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)""í°wa ""9raq.} ‘There was arak.’ (B5:11)
""7-ga qam-lámpa ""í°wa šrà""a.} ‘At that time instead of an (electric)
lamp there was an (oil) lamp.’ (A33:1)
""7-ga ""í°6n ’ixàlo} ""u-""Ašeba†àlo.} ‘At that time there were ’ixalo and
Ašeba†alo.’ (A25:23)When the particle is negative, the nominal is placed after the particle on
several occasions, e.g.
(8) lí° ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There is nothing.’ (A21:5)
(9) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Is there nobody in the house?’ (A22:32)
(10) lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} ‘There are no steps for them to go down
into the basement stable.’ (A22:10)
(11) lí°wa ""ánna q>n9fe-u m6ndiyáne.} ‘There were no armchairs and things
(like that).’ (B5:200)the clause843The nuclear stress is normally placed on the phrase that follows the particle.
It is placed on the particle to express a narrow focus in contexts where the
speaker asserts the existence of something when it may be presupposed
that it does not exist, e.g.
(12) mabyóne ""ì°-xa-m6ndi gu-qèßß6t.} ‘It seems there really is something in
the story.’ (A4:18)
17.3.2. Nominal—Particle
Constructions with the positive existential particle that have the nominal
before the particle are only sporadically attested. They are used when the
nominal is modified by an interrogative particle, e.g.
(1)k6mà 'Abda-Ra˙màn ""í°?} ‘How many 'Abda-Ra˙màns are there?’
(A23:27)The nominal is placed before the particle in contexts where the referent
of the nominal has already been introduced in the immediately preceding context, e.g.
(2)†alítuwa †awalyà°a?} †awalyá°a ""í°wa ràba} ""àx‘i} lá-raba ""i-taxrênna.}
‘ “Did you play games?” “There were many games, but I do not
remember them much.” ’ (B15:30)The preposed nominal may not have been explicitly mentioned, but is
nevertheless bound to previously mentioned items in a set relation. This
is the case in (3), in which the universal set term ‘everything’ includes the
items ‘fine grapes’ and ‘houris’:
(3)""i°-táma ""ènwa †èpi} ""u-˙uriy?t} ""u-kúlla-m6ndi ""ì°gena} ‘There are there
fine grapes and houris. There is everything.’ (A2:8)Constructions with the negative existential particle that have the nominal
before the particle are frequently attested in the text corpus. On some
occasions the referent of the nominal has been mentioned in the preceding
discourse. The construction in such cases does not deny the existence of
the referent but rather denies its presence on the scene, e.g.
(4)""áza xázya jùlla,} júlla lì°.} ‘She goes to find her clothes, but her
clothes are not there.’ (A14:99)844
(5)
(6)
(7)chapter seventeen
""o-xóna zóra lì°.} ‘The young brother is not there.’ (A12:24)
Parizáda ‰ìšla,} †7ra lì°.} ‘Parizada woke up, but the bird is not there.’
(A24:30)
‰íšela ""ánna maymùne,} ""ína ""áni lì°.} ‘The monkeys woke up, but they
(the men) were not there.’ (A14:57)In some cases the referent of the nominal is linked to what precedes by
associative anaphora, such as a set relationship, e.g.
(8)xílle xá‘ca m6n-d-o-dùša.} ßéle mìya,} xa-†6ppí°a míya lì°.} ‘He ate some
of the honey. He became thirsty for water, but there was not a
drop of water.’ (A14:24)In many cases, however, the preposed nominal has no clear anaphoric
relationship with what precedes. The placement of the nominal in such
cases is likely to be conditioned by its lack of referentiality. It would appear
that referential nominals that introduce a referent into the discourse
have a greater tendency to be placed after the nominal than negated,
non-referential ones. In the attested examples the nuclear stress is placed
either on the particle (9–11) or on the nominal (12–13). The placement
of the nuclear stress on the nominal takes place where the negation of
the nominal is reinforced by the negative particle ‘u- or, in the case of
the indefinite pronoun xa, the particle ""ap. The nucelar stress gives added
force to these particles. These negative reinforcement particles may also
be used where the nuclear stress is on the existential particle (10–11):
(9)qímela xìlela.} qímela šqílela xa-""amána xàn‘i zóra.} mútt6lla k6s-réša dìya.}
ßáw°a lì°6n.} ‘They ate. Then they took a small container and put
it at her head. There was no speech (with this).’ (A21:17–18)
(10) xzéle xa-qáßra ràba gó‰a.} zíl5le mèxya t9ra.} ‘ú-naša lì°.} ‘He saw a
very large palace. He went and knocked on the door. There was
nobody.’ (A14:28)
(11) q6m-šaqlàla kanóšta,} daryála gu-nùra.} ‘ú-m6ndi lì°.} ‘She took the broom
and put it in the fire, but there was nothing (= nothing happened).’
(A12:39)
(12) ‘ù-qala lí°.} ‘There is no sound.’ (A18:15)
(13) ""àp-xa lí°.} ‘There is nobody.’ (A33:3)
When two or more negated existential clauses are conjoined, the negative
particle la may be placed before each nominal. In such constructions thethe clause845nominals are presented as being linked in a set relationship. The existential
particle may have either its positive or negative form, e.g.
(14) la-bˆ°a ""í°6n,} ""u-la-nàša ""í°6n.} ‘There is not a house and there is
nobody there.’ (A39:2)
(15) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There is no ass with him, (there
is) nothing.’ (A22:25)
The negative particle la can be used before the positive existential particle
with an asseverative function, e.g.
(16) la-""í°wa manày.} ‘Indeed there was a meaning (to this).’ (B8:33)
17.3.3. Particle Alone
In certain contexts the negative particle is used by itself, without any other
clause constituents.
It may refer anaphorically to a referent in the previous discourse denoting the absence of this referent from the scene, e.g.
(1)Óásan ""Á©a spár5le ta-t-dˆ‰a} ""u-spár5le ta-t-dˆ‰a,} lì°.} ‘Óasan A©a waits
for her to return, waits for her to return, but she is not there.’
(A27:26)Speakers sometimes use the particle as an interrogative tag to receive confirmation from the interlocutor. This is generally used in contexts where
the speaker is sure about what he is saying, but seeks confirmation as a
device for drawing attention to a particular point. The sense can often
be rendered in English by ‘you see’:
(2) ""o-šúla ""áwwa y-amrèxwale qêr†a lí°6n?} ‘We called this job trimming,
you see.’ (B5:141)
(3) mágl6t gilándi xá-mdi gò‰5le lí°6n?} ‘The scythe is something big, you
see.’ (B5:144)
(4) ""ítwa náše šuléy ""àww5le lí°6n?} ‘There were people whose job was this,
you see.’ (B5:135)
(5) ""í°wale qèšta-w géra d-ˆ-ga,} lì°?} ‘He had a bow and arrow (typical)
of that time, you see.’ (A12:32)
In narrative it is occasionally used as a device to draw attention to an
unexpected event, e.g.","[876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881, 882, 883, 884]"

In the light of the foregoing, it is easiest to regard the q†il5le preterite as a
narrative verbal form, characteristic of fictitious discourse, which originally
developed in imitation of the use of the Turkish evidential verbal forms
with -mi{ in fictitious narrative. It did not, however, come to be used as a
fully functional evidential form that could be used outside of narrative.
15.4.1.4. Movement of the Enclitic Copula
As remarked, positive assertive resultative constructions can have the
enclitic or the deictic copula. If special prominence is given to a particular constituent of the clause, however, only the enclitic copula is used. In
such circumstances this is moved from the participle and attached to the
prominent constituent in question. In most cases the constituent that is
given prominence in this way is placed before the participle, whatever its
grammatical function in the clause, and so the movement of the enclitic
is leftwards. In some constructions in narrative the enclitic moves rightwards and is attached to a constituent that occurs after the participle in
the clause.
15.4.1.4.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic
In constructions where the enclitic copula is moved leftwards it is important
to distinguish cases where the constituent that is given prominence bears
the nuclear stress and cases where the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere
in the clause. As a general rule, prominent items bearing the nuclear
stress are clausal arguments expressing some kind of information focus,
by which the speaker wishes to draw the hearer’s attention to important
new information. This may be termed ‘narrow’ focus, in that attention is
drawn to one particular argument in the clause and not to the predicate
or overall proposition as a whole. The normal default position for the678chapter fifteennuclear stress is at the end of the intonation group. Since the focused item
is placed at the beginning of the clause the nuclear stress is in a marked
position. Items given prominence that do not bear the nuclear stress, on
the other hand, are generally not a focus of new information.
(i) Narrow New Information Focus
One type of narrow new information focus that is expressed by the attachment of the enclitic copula is contrastive focus. This is used when the
speaker wishes to correct a misunderstanding by strongly asserting that
one particular item should be selected for the role in question rather than
the one currently entertained by the hearer, e.g.
(1) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} brònux-ile xíla xabúša.} ‘A: “Your brother
has eaten an apple.” B: “No, your son has eaten an apple.” ’
(2) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
“Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
a peach. He has not eaten an apple.’ ”
(3) A: xóni hóle xèzya brat7xu qedàmta} B: l7le qedàmta xèzya brát6n,} têmm6l-ile
xèzy6lla.} ‘A: “My brother saw your daughter this morning.” B: “He
did not see our daughter this morning, he saw her yesterday.” ’
Examples from the text corpus:
(4) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I did
not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of his
sister.’ (A8:85)
(5) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
(A24:31)
(6) yába ""àn6n mšúdr6lla!} ‘I (not God) have sent them!’ (A6:4)
(7) ""àn6n xèzy6lle,} dìyile.} ‘I (and nobody else) have found it. It is mine.’
(A14:15)
(8) ""ànna} Sêttiyela mutt7°6lla láxxa.} ‘S6ttiye (not anybody else) put these
here.’ (A25:36)
In principle when the speaker expresses a narrow focus on one particular
argument of the clause, the proposition of the clause is presupposed to
be known to the hearer and activated in his mind with the exception of
the identity of the argument in question. In (1), for example, the clause
brònux-ile xíla xabúša} is used by the speaker when he presupposes that the
hearer knows that somebody has eaten an apple, i.e. the presuppositionalthe syntax of verbs679background is ‘x has eaten an apple’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the
new information that he is conveying, is that x is to be identified as ‘your
son’.8 In many languages this type of argument focus can be expressed
by a cleft sentence, e.g. ‘It is your son who has eaten an apple’, in which
the assertion of the identity of the argument in focus is expressed by an
identificatory predicate and the presupposition is placed in a subordinate
relative clause. The constructions with copula movement such as brònuxile xíla xabúša} are not cleft sentences since the presupposition is not in a
relative clause and, moreover, the copula agrees with the subject, even if
this is the asserted argument, e.g. ""àn6n mú°y6lle} ‘I have brought it’ (= It
was me who has brought it). The attachment of the copula to the focused
argument and the placement of the nuclear stress on this argument are,
nevertheless, properties of the predicate of a copula clause. It may be
said, therefore, that the construction possesses some properties of a cleft
sentence but does not have all the components of its structure.
Clauses exhibiting leftward movement of the copula may have two foci
of contrast, in which case the subject is given preference for the attachment of the enclitic, e.g.
(9)""àtit °í°a kêsli.} lán ""àna-""6°ya kêsl6x.} ‘You came to me. I did not come
to you.’ (A4:4)
(10) yà-baxta} lan-""àna ""è°ya dmíxa gu-šwì°6x.} ""àtit °í°a dmíxta gu-šwì°i.}
‘Woman, I have not come to sleep in your bed. You have come to
sleep in my bed.’ (A26:4)The presuppositional background of these constructions would have two
unknown variables, e.g. ‘x came to y’ and the speaker is asserting the
identity of both of these.
The intention of the new information focus may be to express exclusivity, e.g.
(11) har-""àtit plíxa} ‘Only you have worked.’ (A21:15)
(12) kúlla hóla q†ìle.} bas-àn6n šrí†a.} ‘They have all been killed. Only I
have escaped.’ (B19:8)
The presuppositional background of these examples would be ‘x has
worked’ and ‘x has escaped’ respectively.","[715, 716, 717, 718]"

y6mmi la-hòya} ""àna} xà°i lá-""az6n xazènna.} ‘It is impossible for me not
to go and find my sister.’ (A37:9)
sab-lá-hoya biš-p°ì°a.} ‘It (the space between the beams) should not
be wider.’ (B5:189)Questions in the qa†6l forms such as (8) and (9) are deontic expressions
whereby the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an
obligation (deontic necessity) or give permission (deontic possibility):
(8)
(9)de-mà†o hóya?} ‘How can it be/should it be?’ (A30:21)
mò-hoyali gwárta-w?} ‘What can marriage be to me?’ (A16:5)On some occasions the modality is epistemic, in that it expresses a less
than complete commitment to the truth of the proposition by the speaker.
Examples (10)–(11) fall into this category, in which the speakers express
disbelief that the situation could exist:
(10) ""ána háw6n Qára Tè≥din,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye,} t-á°e xa-""árxa
""ax-d-àwwa} gu-bˆ°i} ""u-pál6† l7ð6n lˆk5le zála,} l7ka là!} ‘(How could it
be that) I am Qara Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people
of Botan, and a guest comes like this into my house and leaves

(11) ""ána háw6n š¶x d-áyya hênna} ""u-náše lá-""a°a l-diwàni,} ""u-lá-hawa ""àrxi,}
yátwi háwa rê˙qa.} ‘(How could it be that) I am the sheikh of this
place and people do not come to my reception and do not become
my guest, but sit far away.’ (A7:7)
The form is used in the protasis of conditional sentences referring to
present or future time, e.g.
(12) ""6n-háwe t-têrte ""aqlá°a,} ""ána b-zawnênne.} ‘If it were two legged, I
would buy it.’ (A22:5)
(13) ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
(14) ""6n-hóya rázi šènna díya p>làla,} pálga †la-d-áy ""u-pálga †la-d-àw,} maqimêxle.}
‘If she will be happy to share her years, half for her and half for
him, we shall resurrect him.’ (A4:46)the syntax of verbs645In (15) it takes the past time reference of the verb of the main clause as
its deictic centre:
(15) ""6n-háwe yále ràbe,} mère ""7ni máxe sar-amòða?} ‘If there were many children, he (the priest) said “Who will be the first to be baptized?” ’
(B8:44)
It is used in subordinate clauses that are complements of various verbs
and expressions denoting deontic obligation, when the action of the verb
in the subordinate clause is as yet unrealized, e.g.
(16) b8y6n t-áw6t láxxa b-sá""6t tmànya.} ‘I want you to be here at eight
o’clock.’
(17) hammáše míya g8r6g háwa ""èlle dìye.} ‘Water must be on it constantly.’
(B5:78)
(18) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
she goes to and enters, the other has to be (i.e. to follow) after her.’
(B12:2)
Contrast (19) in which the expression laz6m expresses epistemic necessity,
in which the subordinate clause expresses what the speaker believes is a
real situation, rather than one that has not yet been realized:
(19) láz6m ""awwa-ràba ferèss5le.} ‘He must be a heroic warrior.’ (A29:43)
In such cases the word laz6m is sometimes placed at the end of the clause,
e.g.
(20) ""u-xa-mašmóye-wewa ""6llˆni láz6m.} ‘Somebody must have been listening to us.’ (A35:19)
The form is used in clauses expressing purpose, e.g.
(21) ""ána b8y6n ""aláha t-yawèlli kùl-m6ndi bi-záwda,} ta-t-xayú°i hóya spày.} ‘I
want God to give me more of everything, so that my life will be

(22) ""í°wa ko‘5rnáy6t qurðàye} ""ánna ""i-ßáli dàšta} šaxínta háwi b-sêtwa.} ‘There

šaxínta mkasˆwala.} ‘Then they would cover them and place them
in a warm place, which we call a basement-stable. In order for it
to be warm they would cover them.’ (B5:12)
As can be seen in several of the examples cited above, qa†6l forms may
be used in clauses that have past form verbs in the surrounding context
and in such cases they have past time reference, with their deictic centre
in the tense of the adjacent verbs.
15.3.9.1.3. Generic Relative Clauses
The qa†6l form of hwy is used in a relative clause that has a generic antecedent rather than one referring to a specific referent, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)hézuke mòdila?} táli xàwla} b-xa-""ilána t-óya gó‰ta rába ramànta.} ‘What is
swinging? They hang a rope on a tree that is large and very high.’
(B6:7)
kúl naša t-awéle xa-bròna.} ‘Everybody who has a son.’ (B6:35)
""o-t-awéle ""êrwe} y-áwe xzida †àrpa.} ‘Anybody who had sheep, would
harvest leaves.’ (B5:108)
""áw máßli xá-duk°a t-óya šaxínta y-amrèxwa gòma.} ‘They bring them
down to a place that is warm, which we called a “basement stable.” ’
(B5:211)
kút-duk6t t-óya bis-senày,} sab-ràba-""iyewa tálga.} ‘In whatever place was
easiest, since there was a lot of snow.’ (B5:195)15.3.9.2. qa†6lwa
The qa†6lwa form of hwy is occasionally used as a realis past form, referring imperfectively to a situation in the past, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""otáxe gò‰e hawéwa.} ‘The rooms were big.’ (B10:51)
kút-xa hawéwale xà.} ‘Everybody used to have one.’ (B10:11)
""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ""ína hawèwal6n.} ‘We did not use it (raisin
syrup), but we used to have it.’ (B10:18)
mqarb6níwa l-mà°a} sab-tàlga hawéwa,} lì°waley ""ixála.} ‘They would
come near to the village, since there was snow and they did not
have food.’ (B15:37)
kul-má°6t ""ítla ""ùmra} ""an-ma°wá°a hawéwaley šèra.} ‘Every village that
had a church—these villages had a saint’s festival.’ (B6:22)the syntax of verbs647In these examples from the text corpus the subject refers to a class rather
than to a specific referent in the class. Examples (1)–(3) refer to a permanent situation, whereas (4)–(5) may be interpreted as having a predicate
with habitual/iterative aspect. The verb ‘to be’ in clauses with the profile
of (1)–(3) may also be expressed by the past copula (§15.3.5.–6.) or past
existential particle (§15.3.8.).
The qa†6lwa form is also attested as a realis past form in the protasis
of temporal clauses (generally with the subordinating particle D attached
to it), e.g.
(6)""7-g6 t-awéwa m8°>lan báw°6 Ninwàye} yapèxwa làz6m háw5 †èlme.} ‘When
it was, for example, the fast of Nineveh, we had to bake †6lme.’
(B10:95)Elsewhere the qa†6lwa form is used to express irrealis, which cannot be
expressed by the past copula or existential particle, e.g.
(7)xéna ""6n-hawéwa bêsra,} . . . dˆr6xwa bèsra.} ‘If there was meat, . . . we
would serve meat.’ (B10:19)
(8) ""a-šáb°a qam7°a d5r7wa gu-m6ššàra} qa-t-rèzza t-awéwa spày.} ‘During
the first week they would put it in the paddy field in order for the
rice to be (grow) well.’ (B5:135)
(9) hátxa y-as‰ìwa baxtá°a,} ˙átta lá-haw5wa sarkòle.} ‘Women tied them
(on their head) so that they did not have an uncovered head.’
(B10:42)
(10) ""ó-bena ""a-""ilàna} ta-zonìwa náše.} ta-zonìwala,} ta-t-hawéwa hayàrta}
ta-xêtna.} ‘This was so that people would buy the tree, so that they
would buy it, so that it would be a help for the groom.’ (B8:36)
15.3.9.3. ""i-qa†6l
When the ""i- prefix is added to the qa†6l form of hwy, the initial /h/ is
generally elided, e.g. y-awe < ""i-hawe. Occasionally, however, speakers use
the forms without the elision of the /h/.
This form is used in place of the copula or existential particle when
the proposition expressed by the clause has a generic property. This is
conditioned by the generic nature of the subject argument or of the
predicate. The ""i-qa†6l form is used when the subject argument is a generic
class term without a specific referent, e.g. tálga xwàra y-áwe} ‘Snow is white.’
In this example it is the subject that contributes to the generic nature of648chapter fifteenthe proposition. The predicate expresses a permanent property. The form
is also used when the subject argument has a specific referent and the
predicate expresses a habitual, iterative situation, e.g. kút-yom brónux làxxa
y-áwe} ‘Everyday your son is here.’ In such cases it is the predicate that
contributes to the generic nature of the proposition rather than the subject.
In many cases where the form is used both of these factors are operative,
in that the subject is a generic class term and the predicate expresses a
habitual, iterative situation, e.g. kut-šéta tálga gu-†ùra y-áwe} ‘Every year there
is snow in the mountains.’
Examples from the text corpus with generic class terms as subjects and
predicates expressing a permanent property:
(1) lèxma prìša y-áwe.} ‘Bread is different.’ (B5:99)
(2) lawàše} . . . ""i-max7la l-tanùra.} tanùra} y-áwe xamìma.} ‘They put lawaše in
the oven. The oven is hot.’ (B6:48)
(3) ""áw q6qwána gu-†ùra y-áwe.} ‘The partridge is in the mountains.’
(B5:147)
(4) ""ítl5ni halùke,} ""ap-""áni har-gu-""aqàra y-áwa.} ""ap-""áni rába basìme y-áwa.}
""ap-""áni y-áwa smòqe} zˆre} basìme.} ‘Plums, we have plums. These are
only in the farmland. These are also very tasty. They are red and
yellow, (they are) delicious.’ (B5:222)
(5) fa-""áw qunjiyá°e dìye} d-áy mandòrta} y-áwa bêzye} y-áwe bóya bìye.} ‘The
ends of the roller are bored, there are holes in them’ (B5:193)
As is shown by (4), generic class terms may be pronominalized. The subject
may be distributive denoting ‘each one’ of the class concerned, e.g.
(6) kút-xa y-áwe gu-bˆ°e} ""u-heywáne y-áwa mènne dìye.} ‘Everybody is in his
home and his animals are with him.’ (B5:116)
Examples containing a subject with a specific referent and a predicate
expressing a habitual, iterative situation:
(7) béna Rust8mo ""7-g6t dàm6x} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°á l5l>wá°a y-áwe dmíxa
l5-‰ày6š.} ‘Now, when Rustam slept, he would be asleep for three
days and three nights and not wake.’ (A29:19)
(8) b-š6ry>wá°a šaxìnta y-óya dúnye.} ‘During the festivals the weather
(literally: the world) is hot.’ (B6:25)the syntax of verbs649Examples with both generic subjects and habitual, iterative predicates:
(9)sab-""áxni xluláne kèsl6n šàb°a y-áwa.} ‘since in our community weddings are on a Saturday (i.e. each time there is a wedding it takes
place on a Saturday).’ (B5:46)
(10) ""ap-""èrxe b-gàrre y-áwa.} ‘Also the water-mills are by turns (i.e. each
time people use a water-mill they take it in turns).’ (B5:90)
As we have seen, constructions with the basic copula may also be used
to express the permanent property of a generic subject. In this profile,
therefore, there is free variation between y-awe and the copula. This is seen
in cases such as (11), where both forms are used in the same context:
(11) mandórta ""íle kèpa} gò‰a y-áwe,} yá'ni y-áwe mtúrßa xàß-d-ó-m6ndi.} ‘A
roller is a stone, which is large and is made specially for this thing.’
(B5:193)
15.3.9.4. ""i-qa†6lwa
The ""i-qa†6lwa form of hwy is used as a realis past form, referring imperfectively to a situation in the past. It is attested in the text corpus in clauses
with a variety of profiles.
(i) Clauses with a subject argument referring to a specific referent and
with a predicate expressing a permanent property, e.g.
(1)
(2)Mar-Sáwa y-awéwa xa-qaddìša.} ‘St. Sawa was a saint.’ (B6:27)
""úmra qúrb6t b5°-qorayà°a y-awéwa.} ‘The church was near the cemetery.’ (B5:56)(ii) Clauses with a subject that is a class term and a predicate expressing
a permanent property, e.g.
(3)
(4)
(5)q>lúnka bazèkka díya rìxa y-awéwa.} ‘The stem of the pipe was long.’
(B7:19)
†axníwa y-oðíwa qámxa daqìqa y-awéwa.} ‘They would grind it and
make it into flour that was fine.’ (B10:88)
""a-t-la-ßaléwa kaws-díya y-awéwa rába x5làna-w} xlìma,} d5ríwa ""úpra.
‘(A woman) whose whose hair would not (comb) down, (since) it
was very abundant and thick,—they would apply the (oily) mud.’
(B10:68)650chapter fifteen(iii) Clauses with a subject that is a class term and a predicate that can
be interpreted as expressing habitual/iterative aspect, e.g.
(6) ""u-réš6t púnda ""ù¬¬ul y-awéwa.} ‘The top of the wick was upwards (on
each of these occasions).’ (B15:83)
(7) q7†a xêmma y-awéwa rába.} ‘Summer was very hot (each year)’ (B11:34)
(8) rába gáye ráya palê†wa,} . . . palê†wa} qˆsa y-awéwa b-íðe díye.} ‘On many
occasions the shepherd went out . . . He went out with a wooden
stick in his hand.’ (B15:48)
The verb ‘to be’ in clauses with profiles (i) and (ii) may also be expressed
by the past copula.
15.3.9.5. b6d-qa†6l
When the prefix b6d- is attached to hawe, the /h/ is elided and the prefix
reduced to a voiceless stop resulting in the form t-awe. This form is used
to denote a situation in the future, which cannot be expressed by the
copula forms or the existential particle. The aspect expressed by the form
is either perfective, e.g. tèmm6l t-áw6n láxxa sá""6t tmànya} ‘Tomorrow I shall
be here at eight o’clock’, or habitual, e.g. kút-yom t-áw6n láxxa sá""6t tmànya}
‘Everyday I shall be here at eight o’clock,’ which can be still interpreted as
perfective in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express
each individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation. Examples
from the text corpus:
(1) ""áwwa náša f>qìra} t-awéle xá bronà.} ‘This poor man will have a son.’
(A8:3)
(2) †la-d-ˆni t-óya béta?} ‘The egg will be for whom? (D1:3)
(3) ""áyya dàx-t-awya?!} ‘How will this be?!’ (A7:7)
(4) mó-t-oya ""àyya?} ‘What will become of her?’ (A4:38)
With a 1st person subject it is often used to express intention, e.g.
(5) ""àxxa t-óy6n} hál-o-yoma mˆ°6n.} ‘I shall be here until the day I die.’
(A4:45)
(6) ""ána bt-áw6n mênn6x.} ‘I shall be with you.’ (A8:68)the syntax of verbs651With 2nd and 3rd person subjects it may have a deontic sense, e.g.
(7) ""ína Nozáli ""u-Gozàli} bt-áwi m-gèb-brònux} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°ux.} ‘But Nozali
and Gozali will be in place of your son in this house of yours.’
(A8:95)
(8) ""àxxa t-óy6t.} ‘You will be here.’ (A30:20)
(9) málka t-áw6t basìma.} ‘King, you will (I hope) be well.’ (A1:14)
15.3.9.6. q6m-qa†6l
The q6m-qa†6l form, which functions as a perfective past tense, is used only
with pronominal suffixes as an alternative to the q†ille form. It may be used
with the verb hwy when the verb takes an indirect object suffix, e.g.
(1) q6m-hawéla xá°a yakànta.} ‘An only sister was born to them (literally:
was to them).’ (A18:1)
15.3.9.7. b6d-qa†6lwa
This is attested in contexts where it is used to express the future in the
past, i.e. a perfective action that is in the future from the perspective of
some point in the past, e.g.
(1) ""ána bí°6nnux °í°6n bà°rux.} w-ana-l7ð6n t-awètwa ""áti xày6n pal†ètwa
mènni.} júlli mattètwala gu-gùda} ""u-bán6twa ""o-gúda b-rèša.} I loved you
and followed you, while not knowing that you would turn out to be
treacherous to me, that you would put my clothes in the wall and
build the wall over them.’ (A14:101)
In (2) it is used to express discourse dependency, which is a function
exhibited by other verbs in the b6d-qa†6lwa form (cf. §15.1.6.3.). The clause
is an elaboration of what is stated in the clause before it:
(2) ""í°wal6n ""ùmra} Mar-Gwìrgis} ""ax-tré †abàqe} t-bàte} ""í°wabe yá'ni xàmši,}

Various subordinate clauses that are introduced by interrogative particles
may be classified as indirect questions. These are embedded under verbs
such as ‘to know’, ‘to see’, ‘to show’, ‘to say’ and ‘to write’, e.g.
(1)
(2)y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I put him?’ (A22:44)
lá maxzátle ""•lli ""7ka pàl6†?} ‘Won’t you show me where it comes out?’
(A24:38)
(3) xáze mòdila q•ßß6t.} ‘He sees what the problem is.’ (A22:43)
(4) làn-ða""a mo-qaríwale.} ‘I do not know what they called him.’ (A12:20)
(5) ga-l7ð6x . . . ""7nila ""ùrxa.} ‘But we do not know . . . which is the road.’
(A26:18)
(6) ""ína ""ána léyð6n b-7ni dána t-à°e xúwwe.} ‘But I do not know at what
time the snake will come.’ (A24:39)
(7) síq5le l-b5°-qòra,} gu-qawrà°a,} xáze ""7nila qáwra xà°ta.} ‘He went down
to the cemetery and among the graves he saw which (of them)
was a new grave.’ (A25:89)
(8) múr ""ˆni-m6nn6n} biš-šapìrt5la.} ‘Say which of us is the most beautiful.’
(A25:17)
(9) xzi-k6mà t-áz6l ""áwwa táwra.} ‘See how much this ox will go for.’ (A22:1)
(10) b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman mˆ°ena.} ‘I want to know when I shall die.’ (A16:1)
(11) l7la k°ìwe} ""ím6 t-íle bênya.} ‘They have not written when it was built.’
(B6:31)
If an indirect question clause that is introduced by an interrogative particle
contains a subject nominal or independent subject pronoun, this is often
placed before the particle, e.g.
(12) ""úp ""aláha la-y8ðe ""áti ""ìman m5°éti.} ‘Even God does not know when
you will die.’ (A16:11)
(13) ""áw xzèle ""o-dídwa ""7ka wìrre.} ‘He saw where the fly entered.’ (A11:9)
(14) ""u-šákr6x š•mm6t márya ""álaha xáz6x ""úrxa ""ˆk5la.} ‘We shall pray to the
Lord God that we may find where the road is.’ (A26:17)syntactic subordination of clauses977(15) ""6n-lá galêtli} róxux gu-mòdila} ""u-dáx-it xyà""a} ""ána xà-yoma k•slux la-p7š6n.}
‘If you do not reveal to me in what your spirit lies and how you
live, I shall not stay with you a single day longer.’ (A12:40)
The subject may be raised and made the object of the main verb. This
process is reflected by the pronominal object in (16) and (17) and the
object agreement pronoun in (18):
(16) ""an-š5r°†} láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila.} ‘You should know what these conditions are.’ (A24:10)
(17) ""7ni ""ítl5xu t-náše t-máßi mšáw°i mênna} xaz7la mà†ola?} ‘What people
do you have who can speak with her and find out how she is?’
(A4:13)
(18) t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa jùlla.} ‘He will come
and will know what these are (Literally: what these are and are
not) under this cloth.’ (A25:49)
A constituent that does not have the role of subject is occasionally extraposed before the interrogative particle, e.g.
(19) yába t-áz6x xàz6x} ""5-brat7ni mà m•nna.} ‘Let’s go and see what has
become of that daughter of ours.’ (A21:25)
In (20) the embedded interrogative clause is introduced by the complementiser qa-t:
(20) xzéwali qa-t-""ó-f6lsa ""7ka npìlle.} ‘I saw where the coin fell.’ (B15:34)
Interrogative particles are also used to express embedded exclamations, e.g.
(21) xzi-k6m7le lxìma!} ‘Look how fit he is!’ (A15:13)
(22) xzi-""ánna yále k6mà š6†ránela!} ‘Look how beautiful the children are!’
(A8:16)
Some speakers have the practice of introducing new information that is
regarded as worthy of particular attention by an interrogative word, to
which the new information supplies the answer. This question and answer
structure may sometimes be blended together and put in the same intonation group, with the result that the whole construction is most easily
interpreted as an assertion, e.g.","[1014, 1015, 1016]"
"the syntax of verbs681(18) mère yèmmi ""7nile plìxa?} mèra bábi plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra} ""u-""ána
mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “Mother, who has worked?” She said
“My dear, you have worked, (also) the ass and the ox, and I have
attended to the house.” ’ (A21:13)
Observe that in the responses of (16) and (17) the copula that occurs with
the resultative participle is an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. This
reflects a tendency to use the enclitic copula in conversational discourse
when the verbal form is in the presupposition of the clause and is not
asserted. This is typically the case in responses to constituent questions
when the verb is repeated.
The construction is sometimes used elsewhere in a more subjective
fashion, in places where the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to
an item, due to its unexpectedness or its importance in the context, e.g.
(19) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Have you sent for me for this reason?’ (A21:35)
(20) ""abàyele dèrya b-réša.} ‘He put his cloak over her.’ (A26:50)
(21) ""àm6r} ""áwwa t>r7xu póìl5le.} báb6t bráta màra} m-ˆk5le póíla?} har-gubb?n-ix

(22) mèra màlka t-áw6t basíma.} ""áwwa náša hàtx5le wáða.} màra} mú t-àw6ð?}
xa-dúk°6t gèld6t tàwr6n híw6lle báne b7°a.} ‘They said “King, may you
be well. That man is doing such-and-such (i.e. building the fortress
of D6md6ma).” He said “What could he do? I have given him the
space of an ox skin to build a house.” ’ (A11:15)
(23) Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} yá'ni xá°6t Mir-Zàndin-ile šqíla Qára Tè≥din.}
‘Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law, that is Qara Te≥din has married
the sister of Mir-Zandin.’ (A26:55)
(24) ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše.} ‘The Christians were not slipping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)
(25) xòš-zuz6x wíðe.} ‘We have made good money.’ (A14:18)
Constructions such as those in (19)–(25) are not making contrastive assertions to correct a misapprehension nor are they responses to an explicit
constituent question. The section of the clause that is not in focus is not
strictly a presupposition, i.e. it is not necessarily assumed to be a proposition that is active in the mind of the hearer. It is part of the assertion of
the clause but with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused item.
Its lack of communicative pronominence relative to the focused item is a682chapter fifteenproperty that it shares with presuppositional material. The basic function
of the leftward focus movement can, therefore, be identified as a means of
marking an enhancement of prominence on the item in question without
necessarily implying that the remainder of the clause is presuppositional.
In (19)–(22) the motivation for the construction is that the argument in
the clause is deemed by the speaker to be unexpected in the general situation described. In (23) it draws particular attention to the identity of the
person whom Qara Te≥din married, since this is the crucial point that
defines the term x6tna ‘brother-in-law’. Likewise in (24) the speaker gives
enhanced prominence to the ‘sheepskin shoes’ since these were the crucial
reason why the Christians did not slip and so were the key to their success.
In (25) prominence is given to an evaluative expression ‘good money’ in
order to enhance the degree of evaluation.
Temporal adverbial expressions may be put into focus with the construction in order to convey immediacy, e.g.
(26) bálki qam-xa-šàb°5le ""è°ya.} ‘He has come perhaps just a week ago.’
(A8:56)
The focusing of a gradable quantifier or intensifier with the leftward
copula movement conveys an enhanced degree, e.g.
(27) ""ána ràb5w6n plíxa gu-k7rma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
(28) ""áw hàdele bèrya.} ‘He has just been born.’
In constructions such as (27) and (28) the elements that come after the
focus are not necessarily presuppositional, but may be part of the assertion of the clause with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused
item. In such constructions with quantifiers and intensifiers the nuclear
stress is sometimes placed at the end of the intonation group rather than
on the item bearing the copula, e.g.
(29) ""ána ráb5w6n plíxa gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
(30) yóma hádele zrìqa.} ‘The sun has just now risen.’ (A26:37)
(31) xúwwe ""áx‘ile múdwa rìqa.} ‘The snake just managed to escape.’
(A1:15)
In constructions such as (29)–(31) the material after the item bearing the
copula is part of the assertion. These examples show that the copula andthe syntax of verbs683the nuclear stress placement may operate independently in the marking
of prominence. The nuclear stress is in the default position at the end of
the intonation group and signals that the predicate as a whole is asserted
new information. The copula is used to give particular prominence to one
item in this assertion. In such constructions the copula marks a weaker
level of prominence than when it is combined with the nuclear stress. The
item with the copula is, nevertheless, given more prominence than when
there is no leftward copula movement at all, as in (32).
(32) ""ána rába plíx5w6n gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
orchard.’
Conversely the nuclear stress is occasionally moved forward to give particular prominence within the intonation group without the copula moving
from its default position, e.g.
(33) xzáy6t-6lle ""áwwa qàßra?} kúlle b-qarqupyà°a bèny5le.} ‘Do you see this
palace? It is all built of skulls.’ (A24:51)
(ii) Topically Prominent Constituent
A leftward moving copula may also be attached to a topically prominent
constituent. A constituent with topical prominence has a referent that has
been mentioned in the immediately prior discourse, with the result that
it is not only assumed to be familiar to the hearer but also activated in
his consciousness. It serves as the topic of the clause. Unlike an item in
focus, the topic is not part of the assertion of the clause, rather it is the
remainder of the clause that is asserted and that conveys new information
about this topic.
Topical items with a leftward moving copula do not bear the nuclear
stress. They are, therefore, given a weaker level of prominence than focused
items that have both the copula and the nuclear stress.
Not all items that serve as a clause topic have the leftward moving
copula attached to them. This construction is restricted to topics that
the speaker wishes to give particular prominence. One context in which
the construction is attested is where the item has been activated in the
immediately preceding discourse and is repeated in consecutive clauses.
This is the case in (1) and (2), in which the second occurrence of the item
in question has a copula attached to it:
(1)""áti rába wíð6t spayù°a} ""u-""átit pqiðêll6n.} ‘You did a lot of good and
you instructed us.’ (A8:87)684chapter fifteen(2) mátti táxta hàtxa} ta-t-""àzi,} lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} táxt5la mútte hàtxa}
ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They placed a board like this, so that they could go
(there)—there are no steps—so that they can go down to the basement. They placed a board like this, so that they could go down
there.’ (A22:10)
These constituents are anaphorically bound to the immediately preceding discourse and function as the informational starting point, i.e. topic,
of the ensuing propositions. These can be regarded as two aspects of a
broader notion of topic as a current item of concern in the discourse. The
constituents would have this status even if they did not have the copula
enclitic. The copula gives added coding, which enhances the prominence
of this status. This ‘heavy’ coding of the clause initial topic is often used
as a strategy to signal a boundary in the discourse. The purpose of signalling the boundary may be to mark the clause off distinctly from what
precedes in order to give prominence to the content of the clause, which
appears to be the motivation in (1) and (2). In (3) the strategy of boundary marking is used to mark a clear opposition between the actions of
the subject referents in two adjacent clauses:
(3) mbàdla,} qyàm5la,} kúlla b8yi t-àzi,} ""áww5le dmìxa Barzèkko.} ‘In the
morning they got up and all wanted to go, but he, Barz6kko, was
asleep.’ (A12:8)
The construction may also be used to give topical prominence to the
anaphoric element hatxa ‘thus’, which refers back to a situation in the
preceding discourse. In (4) the purpose is to set the two clauses apart and
present them as expressing separate events:
(4) hátx6n wíða be-xàli,} hátx6n wíða be-""àmti} ‘I did such-and-such in the
house of my uncle, I did such-and-such in the house of my aunt.’
(A23:40)
(iii) Other cases of leftward movement
It is necessary to distinguish some other categories of construction which
exhibit leftward movement of the copula enclitic. These include interrogative constituents, adverbials and certain subordinating particles.
(a) Interrogative constituents
The copula element of the resultative is generally attached to interrogative constituents. In some cases the interrogative constituent bearsthe syntax of verbs685the nuclear stress and it can be classified as the expression of a type of
narrow focus. The remainder of the clause is presuppositional and the
focus is put on the interrogative item. Unlike assertive clauses, however,
the identity of the interrogative item is not being asserted but rather
questioned. Examples:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""ˆnile plíxa ""èdyo?} ‘Who has worked today?’ (A21:15)
""ˆnile q†íl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A28:7)
mòdit wíða?} ‘What have you done?’ (A23:34)
yóm6 tré ""ˆk5tu dmíxe?} ‘Where did you sleep on the second day?’
(A12:19)
m-ˆk6t ""è°ya láxxa} ""u-dàx-it ""è°ya?} ‘From where have you come here
and how have you come?’ (A14:33)
dàx-it xíla kúlla?!} ‘How have you eaten all of it?!’ (A2:11)Such constructions are analogous to interrogative clauses such as (7) and
(8) in which the question concerns one constituent:
(7)
(8)""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Was it you who killed the snake?’ (A24:45)
""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} ‘Was it you who brought back my bird?’ (A24:32)In many cases, however, the nuclear stress is placed on the final word of
the intonation group rather than on the interrogative constituent, e.g.
(9) ""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
(10) ""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
(11) m8nile mèßya z6dy6lléy laxxàne?} ‘Who could have thrown them here?’
(A8:15)
(12) módit xèzya qam-ˆnux?} módit xêzya?} ‘What have you seen before your
eyes? What have you seen?’ (A24:31)
(13) módin xèzya b-xêlmi?} ‘What have I seen in my dream?’ (A1:14)
(14) ""7ni báxt5la mubrˆ°a?} ‘Which woman has given birth?’ (A25:6)
(15) †la-módit ""è°ya dmìxa} gu-šwì°i?} ‘Why have you come to sleep in my
bed?’ (A26:3)
(16) ""u-lé-y-y>ð6n m-7k6t ""ê°ya.} ‘And I do not know from where you have
come.’ (A14:76)
(17) y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I have put him?’ (A22:44)
Such constructions, in which the nuclear stress is not on the interrogative
constituent, have a different information structure, in that the question686chapter fifteenis not focused exclusively on the interrogative constituent but rather on
the proposition as a whole. The attachment of the copula enclitic to the
interrogative constituent, therefore, cannot be motivated by its being in
narrow focus. The interrogative constituent, nevertheless, is what the
question primarily requests information about and so is given prominence
by the copula, but this is a weaker level of relative prominence than
constructions in which the constituent is marked both by the copula and
by the nuclear stress.
(b) Adverbials
Narrow focus is sometimes given to an anaphoric adverbial by attaching the copula to it and giving it the nuclear stress. As in some of the
examples of narrow focus on nominals cited above, the remainder of the
clause is not always necessarily a presupposition. The purpose of giving
the adverbial a high degree of prominence is to enhance its anaphoric
function and bind it closely with what precedes, e.g.
(1) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
(2) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
word) †alana means “shady”, since when the sun rose, the mountains
became like that (i.e. became shady).’ (B3:2)
(3) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa
xóni tàm5le bèrya.} ‘My father set up home there. We went, as far as
I remember, together with my older brother. This brother of mine
was born there’. (B8:10)
In (4) this device of enhancing the force of the anaphoric binding of the
adverbial is used in a clause that has the status of a relative clause. The
effect is to bind the clause clearly to the preceding head noun:
(4) ""5-dúk°6t m>m6ðìwal6n,} ""ax-xa-bányo zòra,} ""átxa gu-""úpra nqìra,} kúll6n
tàm5w6x m5mèðe t-íw6x bèrye}—""áw6n pìš5wa.} ‘The place in which they
used to baptize us, like a small bath, dug into the earth, where all
of us who were born were baptized—that has survived.’ (B3:20)
An adverbial that does not bear the nuclear stress may have the copula
attached to it, as in (5), where the copula is moved leftwards onto the tem-the syntax of verbs687poral adverbial in the clause ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme}. This may be regarded as
a type of topical prominence, which is a weaker level of prominence than
the prominence expressed by both the copula and the nuclear stress. The
effect, as is generally the case with clauses with initial topically prominent
items, is to signal a boundary in the discourse. Although the initial item
is anaphorically bound to what precedes, its status as a communicative
starting point is enhanced. This is the case here, in which the clause in
question offers a piece of incidental information about the general historical situation, which is not directly connected to the event of the wedding
discussed in what precedes. This should be contrasted with the function
of the construction occurring earlier in the passage ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni
Šèmmo}, in which the adverbial is given a stronger degree of prominence by
both copula movement (in this case a past copula) and by nuclear stress.
The speaker intends this clause to be bound closely with what precedes,
since it relates directly to the wedding.
(5) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,}
""áskar t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ""6ngl6znàye}
""áskar-t léwi tàxr6n.} ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘I remember
the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune. It
was then that Š6mmo married. I remember the English, the Levy
army. At that time the borders were moved, they were moved up
to Turkey.’ (B9:21)
A similar strategy is exhibited by (6)–(8). Here the adverbs with an enclitic
copula but without the nuclear stress are linked correlatively to the following clause rather than being bound to what precedes. In (6) the following clause specifies the content of the adverb. Examples (7) and (8)
are adversative constructions. The initial adverbials set up an expectation
that is reversed in the second clause:
(6) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situation is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
(7) zíl5le †8ya bràtux.} hád6x-ile wìða,} bás lˆle xèzy6lla.} ‘He went to look
for your daughter. He acted thus, but did not find her.’
(8) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
times we have sat together, I still cannot be like him.’ (A25:44)688chapter fifteen(c) Subordinating Conjunctions
In subordinate clauses opening with the general subordinating conjuction
D or the conditional particle ""6n the copula is attached to the conjunction
at the front of the clause.
The subordinating conjunction D may serve as the head of a relative
clause (1–3) or the subordinative operator of other types of clause, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)
la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do
not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed
has died.’ (A4:33)
t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux dèry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
""áx-t-it-""áti šêtya,} ""áp-""aw hàd6x.} ‘As you have drunk, he also (has
been treated) in the same way.’ (A26:33)
dáx t-in-mu°7°6lla ""a-béna xèta,} ""ay-béna ""àna ma°yánna.} ‘Just as I
brought her before, so this time I shall bring her.’ (A27:30)
""ím6 t-íla mú°y6lla ""a-bráta ""èlle dìye,} mbùrx6lla.} ‘When they brought
that girl to him, they wedded her (to him).’ (A16:6)
xá-xeta qímela zìlela,} ha-t-íla zíle óêmy5le.} ‘They went (to help) once
again, but by the time they had gone, it was put out.’ (A48:4)
l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
(A17:2)On many occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intonation
group, e.g.
""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went
back down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previously.’ (A26:32)
(10) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his
son died.’ (A4:32)
(11) ""ánna dax-t-ìla zíle,} M8mo dèry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘When they had gone,
they put M>mo in jail.’ (A26:74)
(12) ""ax-t-ìle wíra,} ""í°wa dúk°a ta-t-kalèwa.} ‘When he entered, there was
space for him to stand.’ (A22:30)
(9)The placement of the copula on the subordinate particle in relative clauses
can be related to the use of leftward copula movement to mark topicallythe syntax of verbs689prominent items. The referent represented by the D particle, which is that
of the antecedent noun in the adjacent main clause, is clearly the main
topical concern of the relative clause. Although such copula movement
to mark topical prominence is an optional strategy in main clauses, it has
been formalized as a fixed rule in subordinate relative clauses. It would
appear that this was further generalized to other types of subordinate
clause opening with the particle D.
Examples of leftward movement of the copula in protasis clauses opening with ""6n:
(13) ""èn-in ""àna ""è°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep
in you bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
(14) ""6n-it ""è°ya šúl6t qa˙bù°a,} k6s-báb6n B9ku.} ‘If you have come to fornicate, then (lodge) with our father B>ku.’ (A26:26)
The movement of the copula onto the conditional particle ""6n is likely to
have arisen from the fact that the particle was originally followed by D,
as is still the case in some NENA dialects.
15.4.1.4.2. Rightward Movement of the Enclitic
The default position for the nuclear stress of an intonation group is on
the last item in the group. When the nuclear stress occurs in this position,
therefore, it does not necessarily express ‘narrow focus’ on this one item
but frequently expresses a ‘broad focus’ which includes the whole predicate
of the clause.9 The copula element may be shifted rightwards onto this
word with nuclear stress at the end of the intonation group. This is done,
however, only when the nuclear stress is expressing broad focus. The purpose of the construction, therefore, is not to express narrow information
focus on the word, with the remainder of the clause presupposed. Rather,
the clitic gives the item in question an enhanced prominence within the
broad focus of the predicate, due to its importance or unexpectedness. In
example (1) a group of men are transformed into sheep, which is presented
as a surprising and pivotal development by the placement of the copula
on the nouns at the end of the intonation groups. In (2) the rightward
shift of the copula highlights the royal clothes, by which the king’s son
identifies himself, and this is an important turning point in the narrative.","[719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"
"the clause849(1) háw6t hèšy6r ""ítl6n jênne.} ‘Be careful, we have jinn.’ (A22:26)
(2) ""ána b8y6n ""aláha t-yawèlli kùl-m6ndi bi-záwda,} ta-t-xayú°i hóya spày.} ‘I
want God to give me more of everything, so that my life will be
good.’ (A3:3)
(3) hézuke mòdila?} táli xàwla} b-xa-""ilána t-óya gó‰ta rába ramànta.} ‘What is
swinging? They hang a rope on a tree that is large and very high.’
(B6:7)
(4) ""áw máßli xá-duk°a t-óya šaxínta y-amrèxwa gòma.} ‘They bring them
down to a place that is warm, which we called a “basement stable.” ’
(B5:211)
A predicate constituent is put before the verb only in a few sporadic
cases, in which the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to the
constituent, e.g.
(5) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
she goes to and enters, the other has to be (i.e. to follow) after her.’
(B12:2)
17.6. Verb ‘to be’ Omitted
In some cases the verb ‘to be’, in the form of a copula, existential particle
or the verb hwy, is omitted from a clause. The majority of the attested
examples can be classified into the following categories.
17.6.1. Clauses Expressing Supplementary Information
The verb ‘to be’ is sometimes omitted when the situation expressed by the
clause is presented by the speaker as information that is supplementary
to what is expressed in the adjacent clauses, e.g.
(1) xa-náša díye t-ám6rwa ""ána zonènna b-""êßra,} šaqlíwa ""èßra dinàre.} ""u-xéna
t-ám6rwa zonènna b-xamšàss6r,} šaqlíwa xamšàss6r.} qa-xumlàna ""áwwa
mèndi.} ‘One relative of his would say “I shall buy it for ten” and
they would receive ten dinars. Another would say “I shall buy it for
fifteen” and they would receive fifteen. This was for fun.’ (B5:42)
(2) ""áy y-amríla x>dáy6t xêtna.} yá'ni xa-x6llèta †la-xètna ""ap-áyya.} ‘This is
called “the lunch of the groom.” This also was a gift for the groom.’
(B5:48)850chapter seventeen(3) y-azíwa mpal†íwa k yàlo,} m5°7wa be-xêtna.} xlúla t-†¬a°à yomá°a,} xá-šab°a
xlùla.} ‘They would go and bring out the bride and bring her to the
house of the groom. A wedding is for three days or a wedding is
for a week.’ (B8:22)
(4) ""í°wa xáß6t góm6t ""êrwe,} ""u-t-xáß6t tàwre} ""u-t-pà‰e} xòðey.} ""èrwe b-xoðèy,} ""ína
tawrá°a ""u-táwre ""áni kút-xa b-xòðey.} ‘There were special stables for
sheep, special ones for oxen and for lambs, by themselves. Sheep
were by themselves, cows and oxen, they were all by themselves.’
(B10:55)
(5) sètwa tàlga} màrk6n} ""áwwa t-dùša,} ""áwwa t-mêšxa,} ""áwwa t-jàj6k,} ""áwwa
t-gùpta.} ‘In the winter (we had containers known as a) mark6n, one
was for honey, one was for oil, one was for jaj6k, one was for cheese.’
(B8:11)
In (6) the speaker has omitted the copula in the first clause since it is
presented as the background to the following statement concerning the
main protagonist of the narrative. This can be captured in English by
translating it with a subordinate construction such as one introduced by
‘whereas’ or ‘while’:
(6) ""ína kúlla ""an-xéne bná°6t guràne,} ""áyya Šóše brát6t faqìre-wawa.} ‘Whereas all
the others were daughters of gentlemen, this Šoše was the daughter
of poor people.’ (A38:3)
The expression of the verb ‘to be’ is sometimes omitted in clauses describing a state that is circumstantial to an action expressed in an adjacent
clause. Such clauses are sometimes introduced by the connective particle
w, e.g.
(7) bróni hóle xíla ""6dlˆle,} gu-dargúšta dmìxa.} ‘My son was eaten tonight
while asleep in his cradle.’ (A18:2)
(8) m-l7le qìm5le,} ""o-xuláme dìye.} táwre mpúl†6lla-w nùbl6lla} ""u-tullèk°a m6nnedìye,} ""u-bzára m6nne-dìye,} ""u-màsta-w} zeðàye} zíl5le ta-t-z8re.} ‘That servant of his got up early in the morning. He brought out the oxen,
took them (with him) and went to plough, a hound (being) with
him, a plough (being) with him, and also yoghurt and pitta breads.’
(A30:7)
(9) ðiyìle} ""o-pár‘a b-rešèy.} ‘He knew them (while) the cloth (was) on them.’
(A25:50)the clause851If the subject of the circumstantial clause is pronominal, this is regularly
expressed by an independent pronoun when there is a change in subject
from the preceding clause, e.g.
(10) napßènna kúlla b-réše dìye,} ßáli tàma,} ""áwwa dmíxa gu-d-áw ""òt6x.} ‘I’ll
shake them all over him and they will go down there (in the house),
while he is sleeping in that room.’ (A10:10)
(11) xaz7la ""ánna júllux hàtxa,} kášxa-w ""áyya xmàrtux} ""u-sˆrga-w} w-ána bánna dašdàše-w} b-ánna ‘akàlle-w} ""u-š6xtàna-w} šár† qázi t-yawèlla †làlux.}
‘They will see these clothes of yours like this, the smart suit and
this donkey of yours, with the saddle, while I am in these plain
clothes and slippers, all dirty, and the judge will make a sentence
in your favour.’ (A6:7)
When the subject of the circumstantial clause is the same as in the preceding clause, it is sometimes expressed by an independent pronoun, e.g.
(12) y-azíwa zrà""a,} y-azíwa xzàda,} y-azíwa m5°óye mèndi ta-bˆ°a} ""áni ßìme.}
‘They would go to cultivate (the fields), go to harvest, go and bring
things for the house, while they were fasting.’ (B16:17)
In some cases, however, there is no morphological expression of the
subject, e.g.
(13) ""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha,} har-dbíše b-bronèy.} ‘They did not pray to
God, being constantly attached to their son.’ (A15:17)
Of a similar nature are imperative expressions such as qu-qima! ‘Stand
up!’ (literally: ‘Stand while being standing’), tu-tiwa! ‘Sit down!’ (literally:
‘Sit while being seated’), páqðu tìwe!} ‘Please sit down’ (A15:8) (§15.7.
examples 42–44).
The close connection of the reduced circumstantial clause to the main
clause is sometimes expressed prosodically by combining the two in the
same intonation group, e.g.
(14) ""ána majbúr-iw6n t-áz6n qá†l6n gáni pálx6n w-áy dmíxta maxlênna?} ‘Was
I obliged to kill myself working to feed her while she was asleep?’
(A21:38)
(15) kú-mdit láy6p náša yála zòra} ""áyya pyàša gu-réš6t náša.} ‘Everything that
a person learns (while he is) a young child, this remains in the
mind of person.’ (B8:20)852chapter seventeenThe copula is sometimes omitted in questions. This is found in questions
that are used as a device to introduce information that is supplementary
to what precedes, e.g.
(16) ""ay-""ilána ""ˆka?} masqíwala gàre.} ‘Where is the tree? They take it up
to the roof.’ (B5:39)
(17) ""o-Dáwið mòdi šúle díye?} máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle} xáy6†wa ßàwle.} ‘What
is the profession of that David? He used to polish shoes and sew
shoes.’ (A16:1)
In (19) the copula is omitted in a clause expressing a supplementary piece
of information that the speaker has previously forgotten:
(18) bína ""ána ""áxxa nšéli xa-mêndi.} k yàlo} ""íman t-a°yàwa} pá°a díya mkusˆ°a.}
k yàlo} pá°a díya mkusˆ°a.} ‘But I have forgotten something here. The
bride, when she came, her face was covered. The bride’s face was
covered.’ (B5:35)
17.6.2. Gapping in a Series of Clauses
The expression of the verb ‘to be’ is sometimes omitted also in a series of
clauses of equivalent status in the discourse. In a series of closely related
clauses, ‘gapping’ of the expression of the verb ‘to be’ may take place in
the clauses that follow the first of the series. This is found, for example,
in (1) and (2), in which clauses of parallel structure are linked together.
(1)
(2)S6ttíye ""5-gò‰ta-wawa} ""u-Nàze} gawˆ°a} ""u-Zíne ""5-zòrt6t kúlla.} ‘S6ttiye
was the oldest one, Naze the middle one and Zine the youngest.’
(A26:20)
bejíye hóla xa-gòta} ""èrwa xa-gòta.} ‘The young lambs were one side
and the sheep the other.’ (A25:31)Such gapping of the verb ‘to be’ is more commonly found in clauses
containing compound verbal forms that consist of the verb ‘to be’ and the
resultative participle or the infinitive. This occurs in narrative in clauses
expressing an event that is presented as directly sequential to a preceding
event (§15.4.1.3.):
(3)
(4)""è°y5le wìra.} ‘He came and entered.’ (A26:47)
""u-sìq5le} súse kèlya tàma.} ‘He went up and his horse stopped there.’
(A26:28)the clause853(5) ""ánna plà†5la,} kúlla zála ßˆda.} ‘They go out and all go hunting.’
(A13:7)
(6) súse díye mtaslóm6lle †la-xolàma.} wára gu-‘ádre dìye,} dmáxa hal-mbàdla.}
‘He handed over his horse to the servant. He entered his tent and
slept until morning.’ (A12:8)
17.6.3. Presentative Constructions with the Particle ""ina
The presentative particle ""ina is used in various contexts to introduce a
referent or a proposition in place of the verb ‘to be’ (§18.1.5.1.), e.g.
(1) qrúla qrúla kèsle dìye} ""ína xa-bˆ°a,} xa-qáßra rába šapìra.} ‘They came
near to it and behold a house, a very beautiful palace.’ (A14:42)
(2) ""ína xa-senìye} dáwa xaße-díye xá-xuwwe zòra,} réš6t nàša} ""u-gán6t xùwwe,}
gu-d-à seníye.} ‘Behold a gold tray on which there was a small snake
with the head of a man and the body of a snake.’ (A14:31)
(3) qímela zíle xèzye ""ína d°s} xa-képa hàtxa} ""u-ða-yàdde gáwe díye,} t-prêzla.}
‘They went and saw that it was true, there was a stone like this,
with a handle of iron in it.’ (A14:13)
(4) yèmme dìye} ""u-báxte díye táma xèzy6lle sùsa,} ""ína sapìqa.} ‘His mother and
his wife there saw that the horse was without a rider (literally: saw
the horse behold empty).’ (A28:29)
17.6.4. Presentative Constructions with Demonstratives
In clauses with the speaker deixis demonstrative as subject which have
the function of presenting an item to the hearer, the copula is usually
omitted, e.g.
(1) ""áwwa qðìla.} ‘This is the key (= Here is the key).’ (A12:63)
(2) ""áwwa ""ixàla} †làlux.} ‘This is food for you (= Here is some food for
you).’ (A17:12)
Of a similar nature is the phrase ""áyya xá-šeta (literally: This is a year =
Look it is a year) in (3):
(3) ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘It has been a year that
they have been here but have not asked for you.’ (A26:78)854chapter seventeen17.6.5. Exclamatory Clauses
When the clause expresses an exclamation, the verb ‘to be’ is often omitted, e.g.
(1) ""áti bìš-zlima mènni!} ‘You are more oppressed than me!’ (A13:5)
(2) ""áwwa hambišàya!} ‘It is a giant!’ (A31:2)
(3) nèmu ""ánna là-biš †áwe m-áwwa Gozáli xóni!} ‘Surely they are not better
than Gozali, my brother!’ (A8:72)
In various constructions expressing wishes, a deontic form of the verb
hwy is omitted, e.g.
(4) basíma ràba.} ‘Thank you very much.’ (literally: ‘May you be very
healthy’; cf. háw6t basíma ràba} A22:31)
(5) qè†ma b-rèšux!} ‘May ash be on your head!’ (A23:8)
(6) ""álaha šuxa-l-šèmme ‘God—praise be to his name’ (A6:10)
(7) bríxta dudíya t-iw6t ""áti qíma gàwa!} ‘Blessed be the cradle in which you
grew up!’ (A21:41)
(8) y-azíwa mšamšíwa b5°-qòra,} rè˙qa m6n-an-dukàne!} ‘They would go and
hold a ceremony in the cemetery—(may death be) far from these
places!’ (B10:3)
The exclamation may be expressed in the form of a question, e.g.
(9) mú-t qála dìyi?} ‘What is my voice (in comparison with his)?’
(A25:44)
17.6.6. Proverbs
Expressions of the verb ‘to be’ are often omitted in proverbial contexts, e.g.
(1) lèxma šaxína darmán6t náša kpìna.} ‘Hot bread is the medicine of a
hungry man.’ (D2:69)
(2) lišáne rìxa} ""u-xáße †wìxa.} ‘His tongue is long, but his back is broken.’
(D2:67)
(3) dárta l-yòma,} ""èrwe gu-gòma.} dárta l-sèra,} ""èrwe l-†èra.} ‘If the sun has a
halo, the sheep will be in the basement stable. If the moon has a
halo, the sheep will be in the noon sun.’ (D2:15)the clause85517.6.7. Meteorological Expressions
In some meteorological expressions that have the general term dunye ‘world,
weather’ as subject or leave the subject unspecified, the copula tends to be
omitted, e.g. ""èdyo šaxìnta} ‘Today it is hot’. In a similar manner the copula
is omitted in meteorological expressions with an infinitive such as dúnye
ràya} ‘It is raining’ or ráya tàlga} ‘It is snowing.’
17.7. Verbal Clauses
17.7.1. Basic Verbal Clauses
A verbal clause may consist of a verbal form alone, with the participants
of the activity expressed by affixes but without any other independently
standing components, e.g.
(1) ""àz6l} ‘He goes.’ (A28:33)
(2) ""à°ena.} ‘I shall come back.’ (A26:30)
(3) damxàwa.} ‘She would go to sleep.’ (A18:1)
(4) raqðìwa.} ‘They would dance.’ (B7:4)
(5) tìwle.} ‘He sat down.’ (A15:1)
(6) kpìnna.} ‘They became hungry.’ (A20:9)
(7) t-axlênne.} ‘I shall eat it.’ (A23:5)
17.7.2. Clauses with a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is placed either before
or after the verb.
17.7.2.1. Subject—Verb
Most subjects that are placed before the verb are definite, e.g.
(1) téla rìqle.} ‘The fox ran.’ (A20:5)
(2) málka rwèle.} ‘The king became drunk.’ (A17:26)
(3) kúlle b7°e qìdle.} ‘All of his house burnt.’ (A48:7)
(4) gáw‰i °èle.} ‘My husband has come back.’ (A22:32)
(5) dèbba zílt5la tàma.} ‘The bear went there.’ (A20:6)856chapter seventeenIn descriptive discourse, indefinite subject constituents introducing new
referents are sometimes placed before the verb in foreground sections
concerning a habitual activity or generic situation, e.g.
(6)
(7)xa-náša y-azêlwa} . . . y-azèlwa ‘yàda,} b7°a bˆ°a.} ‘A man would go . . .
he would go from house to house making invitations.’ (B5:20)
báxta y-àza} mattála qaßxàne} rèš-bèrka dìya.} ‘A woman would go and
place a pail on her knees.’ (B5:175)In narrative, indefinite subjects that introduce a specific referent tend
to be placed before the verb in background rather than foreground sections of the discourse. The background may be presented as a perfective
event or an imperfective situation. In (8) the clause expresses a punctual
event that opens a background section of narrative that explains how the
protagonist lost his hand. The clauses in (9)–(11) express a background
resultative state and the construction in (12) denotes a background ongoing activity. The lack of the indefinite particle xa in (8) and (12) reflects
the diminished tendency to use this particle in backgrounded sections of
discourse (§14.1.2.2.).
(8)
(9)""árya °éle †álbe dìye.} ‘A lion attacked him.’ (A11:1)
""êdl5le} xa-bráta °í°5wa dmíxta kêsli.} ‘Last night, a girl had come and
slept with me.’ (A26:10–11)
(10) xa-nàša} sìq5wa} l-†ùra.} ‘A man had gone up into the mountains.’
(A31:1)
(11) xa-náša hóle mì°a.} ‘A man had died.’ (A17:7)
(12) xà-yoma} dèbba xðára-wawa gu-†uràne.} ‘One day a bear was wandering
around the mountains.’ (A20:1)
If, however, an indefinite subject constituent is a narrow information
focus, it is fronted before the verb in all contexts, including where the
verb expresses a punctual foreground action. The nuclear stress is placed
on the subject in these circumstances. This construction is found in contrastive contexts where the speaker corrects a misapprehension of his
interlocutor, e.g.
(13) A: q6m-qa†èlle ""àrya.} B: là,} dêbba q6m-qa†lále.} ‘A: “A lion killed him.”
“No, a bear killed him.” ’the clause857In such constructions, the verb is in the presupposition of the clause,
which in this case is ‘x killed him’. The subject, therefore, is a narrow
new information focus, which asserts the identity of x.
In (14) the indefinite noun in focus does not have a specific referent:
(14) díga lè-yað6l.} k°ˆ°a yádla.} ‘A cock does not lay eggs. A hen lays eggs.’
(D1:3)
Of a similar structure is (15), in which an indefinite subject with the nuclear
stress on the subject occurs in initial position and the verb is repeated from
the preceding discourse. The subject is not, however, intended to replace
that of the preceding clause but rather it is a component of a separate,
albeit related, event, e.g.
(15) °éle màlla.} . . . mu'àll6m °éle.} ‘A mullah came . . . (then subsequently) a
teacher came’ (A22:3–5)
This again is a kind of new information focus on the subject. The verb
is presented as a presupposition. It is not completely old information
recoverable from the preceding clause, but rather is linked to it in a set
relationship, i.e. the set of the acts of coming.
A subject that is a non-referential negated constituent is treated like
definite constituents as far as order is concerned and freely occurs in
foreground narrative sections in all contexts, e.g.
(16) ""áp-xa la-šqìlle.} ‘Nobody bought it.’ (A22:6)
(17) ""áp-xa lá-ßbirre ""asêqle.} ‘Nobody dared to undertake it.’ (A33:4)
A subject that is placed before the verb is sometimes presented in a separate intonation group, e.g.
(18) náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
(B6:21)
(19) báb6t bràta} xazéwa yèmm6t bràta.} ‘The father of the girl would see
the mother of the girl.’ (B5:2)
(20) mìya} maz6vríle xa-parwàna.} ‘The water drives round a propellor.’
(B6:53)
(21) ""ó t-là pál6x} lè y-áx6l.} ‘Whoever does not work does not eat.’
(A21:13)858chapter seventeen17.7.2.2. Verb—Subject
In clauses expressing a foreground punctual event the subject constituent is
generally postposed after the verb if it introduces a new referent that has
a prominent role in the discourse. In narrative this construction is typically
used when a new protagonist character comes onto the scene, e.g.
(1) °éle màlla.} ‘A mullah came.’ (A22:3)
(2) °í°5la xa-bràta.} ‘A girl came.’ (A16:2)
(3) ""ína ""è°y5le xa-yàla,} xa-""aßò†a.} ‘But a tiresome youth came.’ (A17:7)
The referent is not necessarily always indefinite. This construction is used
also where the subject is definite, but newly introduced into the discourse.
This is seen in (4), which is the report of an event uttered by the speaker
in isolation without any preceding or immediate following context. The
subject constituent ‘my house’ is definite in status, but newly introduced
and prominent in the mind of the speaker:
(4) ßríx5le yàba} qídle bˆ°i!} ‘He shouted “Oh, my house has burnt down!” ’
(A48:4)
On many occasions, however, the postposition of the subject after the
verb does not have this presentative function that is independent of a
preceding context. Rather, the subject is familiar to the hearer from the
previous context or is, at least, related in some way to the previous context. In such cases the motivation for the construction is to express the
existence of a close semantic relationship of the clause with the preceding
discourse. When it is used in narrative, the close relationship with what
precedes may be one of close temporal sequence and spatial continuity.
The effect is to present the series of clauses as components of the same
overall event. The subject may be the same as that of the preceding main
event clause (5–6) or it may be different (7–8):
(5) mèra gáw‰a ma-yxàl6f.} ""ána b-ßalyàna.} ßlí°5la bàxta.} ‘She said “Husband, it’s all right. I shall go down (to the town).” The woman went
down.’ (A22:11)
(6) mère bráti lá là.} ""áti ""àxl6t.} ""áxni t-àzexi.} lá p5š6x †la-x>dàya.} ""u-qím5le
màlka.} ‘He said “My daughter, no, no. You eat. We shall go. We
shall not stay for lunch” and the king got up (to leave).’ (A21:30)
(7) zìl5le,} qedámta qímt5la bràta-w} mx5lált6lla ""ay-dùk°a.} ‘He went
away and in the morning the girl got up and cleaned the place.’
(A17:27)the clause
(8)859x°ìm6lle.} kúlle zqìr6lle-w} píšt5la hád6x dèbba gàwe.} ‘He finished
it. He wove it all and the bear remained inside it.’ (A20:4)As can be seen in the preceding examples, the nuclear stress is normally
placed on the subject constituent. It is occasionally retracted onto the verb,
especially where the speaker wishes to give prominence to a climactic or
important event. In (9), for example, the fall of the fox is a climax:
(9)mère díya mò t-óðexi?} qú npila-xìla.} qú npila-xìla.} †rípela l-©ðàðe} npìlle
téla.} ‘He said “Now what shall we do? Come on (let’s fight and)
whoever falls (first) will be eaten.” They attacked each other and
the fox fell.’ (A20:10)The verb—subject construction is used in descriptive discourse in a similar
manner to express the close temporal sequence of habitual events. This
is seen in (10)–(12). In (11) and (12) the temporal anteriority of the first
clause is explicitly marked by the conjunction bar ‘after’:
(10) q7mi mpál†i k yálo marqðìla.} bína y-á°i náše qam°èy,} šaqlíla maßlˆla}
qam-t>r6t-b7°a gò‰ta y-óya.} maduqíla xètna-w k yálo got6-©ðàðe,} ""u-béna
náše ràqði.} ‘They bring the bride out and make her dance. Then
people come up to them and take them down to a large space
outside. They put the groom and bride together side by side and
then people dance.’ (B5:50)
(11) bár hàd6x,} bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le
qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ‘Afterwards, after the woman has become
official there, that is she enters the house, the priest comes and
ties the band.’ (B5:44)
(12) bár mbarxìwa,} ""u-razgìwa} béna y-atwíwa kyálo-w xêtna-w} ‘Afterwards, after they performed the blessing and were finished, the
bride and the groom would sit down.’ (B5:30)
The postposition of the subject may express cohesiveness with what
precedes in contexts where there is no temporal sequentiality. In (13) the
construction follows the existential clauses that introduce the characters of
the narrative. It coheres with these in that it continues to give background
information that forms the setting for the main narrative. The verbs in
this background setting express habitual rather than punctual actions. The
same applies to the (14), which also occurs in a background section. In
(15) the clause with the postposed subject coheres closely with what860chapter seventeenprecedes in a causal relationship. In (16) the construction supplies supplementary detail to the statement made in the preceding clause:
(13) ""í°wa xa-gáw‰a-w bàxta.} ""í°wala bnòne.} kùt-yum} ßaléwa gàw‰a} l-šùqa}
msawòqe} ""u-‘ú-m6ndi l7 m5°èwa.} ‘There was a man and a wife. They
had children. Every day the man would go down to the market to
do shopping, but would bring nothing back.’ (A22:1)
(14) ""ítwala xa-qaráw6t gò‰ta.} m5°íwala xadamyá°a díya ""ixàla,} y-axlàwa-w} damxàwa.} ‘She had a big bed. Her servants would bring
her food, she would eat then go to sleep.’ (A21:1)
(15) xáze mòdila qèßß6t} míya lˆla °áya.} hóle ßèlya ""o-náša gu-mìya.} ‘He
saw what the problem was. The water was not flowing (because)
that man had come down into the water.’ (A22:43)
(16) šèmša mxí°a l-†uràne,} heš-l7la kmìlta šèmša.} ‘The sunshine has
struck the mountains, but the sunshine has not yet completely
(spread).’ (A26:37)
The coherence may be one of total overlap, in that the clause is no more
than a reiteration of what precedes, e.g.
(17) wír5le tàma} ""u-dèbba zílt5la tàma.} zílt5la dêbba} ""u-dráy6lla ""íða díya
""èlle dìye.} ‘The fox entered there and the bear went there. The bear
went there and put her paw into it.’ (A20:6)
It is worth noting that this coherence principle can also be identified in the
tendency for verb—subject order to be used in syntactically subordinate
clauses, whose close semantic connection with what precedes is signalled
by a subordinating particle. This applies, for example, to purpose clauses
such as (18):
(18) mátt6t q7sa gáwe dìye,} t-lóxi ""ánna qˆse.} ‘You put wood in it and the
wood blazes up.’ (B15:23)
17.7.2.3. Further Remarks on the Function of Subject Position
In general, it can be said that the verb—subject construction is ‘eventorientated’. When, by contrast, the subject constituent is placed before
the verb, the construction can be said to be ‘topic-orientated’. The shift
of attention from the event-line to a topic referent at the front of a topicorientated clause causes it to be interpreted has having a lesser degree of
cohesion with what precedes. In foreground narrative the placement of thethe clause861subject before the verb may be used to express the onset of a new section.
The effect is that the clause is in principle forward looking, cohering with
what follows, rather than cohering with what precedes. In (1) the clause
‘The king became drunk’ with an initial subject follows sequentially the
preceding speech. It is not, however, presented as a tag to this speech but
rather as the onset of an episodic section in which the woman disposed
of his inebriated body. Similarly in (2) the clause ‘The king was perplexed
regarding her (i.e. his daughter)’ is presented as the onset of a section of
discourse that describes his worries about her.
(1) mèra d6-yàlla,} jàlde,} ští ta-t-dàmx6x.} málka rwèle.} rwèle} q6m-doqále

that we can go to sleep.” ’ The king became drunk. He became
drunk and she grasped him by his legs, dragged him along and
took him to the bathroom, then closed the door behind him. She
came back and went to sleep in her room. She closed the door and
went to sleep.’ (A17:26)
(2) †rìsla rába.} málka hírre b-gáne díye bíya dìya.} ""áp-xa l7le gwàr6lla.} mère
""ána mò-""oð6n?} xa-‘ára xazèna.} ‘She became very fat. The king was
perplexed regarding her. Nobody would marry her. He said “What
should I do? I should find a solution for this daughter of mine.” ’
(A21:1–2)
A shift in subject from that of the immediately preceding discourse is not
always the crucial factor that conditions the placement of the subject in
initial position. This is shown by the fact the speaker in many cases opts
for a verb—subject continuity construction where there is a change of
subject (e.g. §17.7.2.2. examples 7–8). The crucial factor is rather that the
speaker decides to present the clause as disjoined from what precedes in
some way.
The disjoining expressed by the subject—verb construction sometimes
reflects a lack of temporal sequentiality between the events expressed in
clauses. This is clearly seen in (3) where subject initial clauses are used to
present a listing of events that occurred in parallel. In (4) the subject—verb
clauses expresses an action undertaken by Zine and her servants that overlaps temporally with that of the preceding clause. The important point
is that in both cases the actions expressed by the subject—verb constructions are presented as distinct events rather than cohering together in a
single overall event:862chapter seventeen(3) mèra ""ána báxt6t ""á©6t ô?l-iw6n.} ""áyya xmá°a díya homênna.} x6myána
homênne.} bróna homênne.} kúlla homênna.} kál°a là homènna.} ‘She said “I
am the wife of the a©a of ôàl.” Her mother-in-law believed it. Her
father-in-law believed it. The son believed it. Everybody believed
it. The daughter-in-law, however, did not believe it.” ’ (A19:2)
(4) qím5le ""è°ya síqa l-gàre.} síq5le l-gàre} maxzóy6lle Jazíra Bòta.} Zìne} ""u-""ánxaddamyá°a díya ßléla r6š-""ˆna.} ‘Now, he came and he went up onto
the roof. He went up onto the roof to show him Jazira Bota. Zine
and her maid-servants went down to the spring.’ (A26:40)
In (5) the verb—subject clauses are temporally sequential with what precedes. The clause ‘The three hundred horsemen returned’, on the other
hand, has a subject—verb structure. This reflects the fact that it is not
directly sequential to what precedes but rather presents a final synopsis
of the overall series of preceding events.
(5) mère sò} kut-qón6x yòma} d7‰i ""èmma m6nnˆxu.} [ VS] ""amrítu ""áxni là-m†el6n

You will say: We have not reached Jazira Bota. We do not know
where it is.” Three hundred horsemen went off. Every day a hundred returned. Everyday a hundred returned. The three hundred
horsemen returned and said ‘We have not found where Jazira Bota
is.” ’ (A26:14–15)
On some occasions a subject-initial clause is used to introduce a new referent into a narrative. In such cases the referent generally does not play a
prominent role in the discourse as a whole, although it may have topical
continuity over a series of several clauses. Here the boundary marking
function of the subject—verb construction overrides the presentative function of the verb—new subject construction, since the latter is used only
to introduce referents of textual importance. This applies to (6)–(8), in all
of which the referents of the subject constituents play only an incidental
role in the discourse:
(6) ""ê°y5le,} qam-t8r6t b7°a tíw5le hàd6x.} bábe díye °èle.} mère ha-bròni,} M9mo}
mà-lux} tíw6t xaššàna?} ‘He came and sat down in front of the door
of the house. His father came. He said “Ah, my son, M>mo, why
are you sitting (looking so) sad?” ’ (A26:10)the clause
(7)
(8)863jênne} t-šmàyya} qímla wídla tàgbir.} ‘The jinn of heaven made a plan.’
(A26:1)
""árya °éle †álbe dìye.} ‘A lion attacked him.’ (A11:1)In descriptive discourse expressing habitual or generic events, the subject
is in principle placed before the verb in all contexts where the speaker
wishes to present the clause as disjoined in some way from what precedes.
In (9), for example, the subject initial clause ‘The priest would take a long
stick’ opens the section of discourse that describes the geyasa ceremony.
The verb initial clause ‘The people would go and take communion’, on the
other hand, continues the introductory background section. In (10) the
two subject initial clauses express two distinct events that occur in a parallel opposition:
(9)""o-yóm6t trè t-""éða} y-amríle geyàsa.} geyàsa} yóm6t trè} t-""éða gò‰a.} y-ázi náše

‘The second day of the festival was called geyasa (‘the [good] thief ’).
The geyasa was the second day of the festival. The people would
go and take communion. The priest would take a long stick. He
would take it in his hand and make a sign like this on the heads
of the people, he would tap it on the heads of the people, as
blessings.’ (B6:3)
(10) ""an-t-ìla qam-t9ra t-á°i gawàye,} ""an-gawáye pál†i qam-t9ra.} ‘The ones that
are outside come inside and the ones inside go outside.’ (B11:9)Generic and proverbial statements, which by their nature stand independently of a context, in principle have the subject in initial position, e.g.
(11) mi°7ni dˆ‰i.} ‘Our dead return.’ (A22:37)
(12) neríya b-gè≥≥e lè-may6°.} ‘A male goat does not die (at the sight of a
raised) hand.’ (D2:12)
(13) qála m6n-qáwra lè-y-a°e.} ‘A voice does not come from the grave.’
(D2:13)
(14) ""ó t-là pál6x} lè y-áx6l.} ‘Whoever does not work, does not eat.’
(A21:13)
(15) xètna lè-xaze k yálo.} ‘The groom does not see the bride.’ (B5:35)864chapter seventeen17.7.3. Subject Verb Agreement
In principle, the inflection of the verb agrees in number, gender and person
with the subject nominal. In a few cases, however, there is a discrepancy
of agreement. The attested examples may be classified as follows.
In clauses with the verbs hwy and pyš that are used existentially with the
subject placed after them, the verb sometimes remains in the 3ms even
when the subject is 3fs. or 3pl., e.g.
(1) píš5le têrte.} ‘Two remained.’ (A22:9)
(2) píš5le gˆrme.} ‘(Only) bones remained.’ (A2:5)
(3) q6m-hawéla xá°a yakànta.} ‘An only sister was born to them.’ (A18:1)
In a few cases these verbs have 3fs. inflection when the following subject
is plural, e.g.
(4) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
(B5:163)
(5) ""u-píšt5la ""an-d6bbòre} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘The hornets remained, flying
back and forth.’ (A20:8)
As discussed in §14.2.3., the feminine singular is used in some temporal
adverbial expressions to refer to the general temporal situation in a narrative. This can result in some constructions in which 3fs. verb forms appear
to take a following plural noun as their grammatical subject, e.g.
(6) zílta láxxa tre-†¬à-yarxe,} ""arbà-yarxe,} mère xa-béna xéta mjarbênna.} ‘Two or
three months, four months passed. He said “I’ll test them again.” ’
(A48:4)
(7) y-oráwa kèma yàrxe.} ‘Several months would pass.’ (B5:18)
In such cases, however, the 3fs. inflection should be interpreted as referring to the general temporal situation: ‘(Time) went by (for) two or three
months, four months’, etc.
In a few cases the verbal agreement is based on the sense rather than
the form of the subject noun. In (8) and (9) the collective nouns ""askar
‘army’ and b6‰-našu°a ‘mankind’ are construed as plural.
(8) ""u-kúlla ""áskar qlíbela píše náše xa-ga-xèta.} ‘All the army returned and
became men again.’ (A8:83)
(9) b6‰-našù°a} zlìm6lli.} ‘Mankind has wronged me.’ (A14:34)the clause865A subject constituent consisting of a combination of a 1s. and a 2s. pronoun takes 1pl. agreement on the verb, e.g.
(10) ""ána w-áti xon>wà°6x.} ‘You and I are brothers.’ (A15:7)
(11) ""ána ""u-""áti q†él6n l-d-áwwa šùla.} ‘You and I decided on this matter.’
When the conjoining of the subject referent with another referent expresses
a concomitative relationship, the verb sometimes agrees only with the first
referent. This is found when two conjoined pronouns are placed after the
verb, e.g.
(12) kèly5le gu-t8r6t b7°a ""áw ""u-""ày.} ‘He stood at the door of the house
together with her.’ (A4:55)
17.7.4. Independent Subject Pronouns
A pronominal reference to the subject of the clause is contained within
the inflection of a verb and so the additional occurrence of an independent subject pronoun is redundant with regard to the identification of
the subject. The use of an independent pronoun does, nevertheless, have
discourse functions. These functions are performed both by independent
pronouns in verbal clauses and also by those that occur in copula clauses.
The following discussion, therefore, will include examples from both verbal
and copula clauses. The subject pronoun may be placed either before or
after the verb/copula.
17.7.4.1. Preposed Subject Pronouns
When an independent subject is placed before the verb or copula, its
function depends on the prosody. If it does not bear the nuclear stress,
the motivation for the use of the pronoun is generally to mark some kind
of semantic discontinuity in the discourse. The discourse function of such
clauses, therefore, is similar to that of clauses with subject nominals in
initial position. The various types of semantic discontinuities include the
following.
(i) Shift in Subject Referent
An independent subject pronoun is used when there is a change in subject, e.g.","[887, 888, 889, 890, 891, 892, 893, 894, 895, 896, 897, 898, 899, 900, 901, 902, 903, 904]"
"the syntax of verbs753(4) ""u-Dùre} píšt5la muqyàmta} muxràwta} šawwà gáye} l-xànpe} qa†òle}
t-muš6lmàne.} ‘Dure was evacuated and destroyed seven times by
pagan murderers of Muslims.’ (B2:2)
Constructions with a past perfective of pyš such as pišle q†ila or its equivalent in narrative piš5le q†ila correspond in function to the obsolescent q†il
form.
In (5) the resultative participle of pyš is combined with the past copula:
(5) ""éða gó‰a ""íle xa-†ùxsa} qyámt6t Mšíxa bá°6r t-wéwa píša q†ìla.} ‘The Great
Festival is a ceremony (commemorating) the resurrection of Christ
after he had been killed.’ (B6:1)
In (6) a future form of pyš is used, in (7)–(8) an irrealis form and in (9) a
past habitual form:
(6) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)
(7) yába ""ána t-à°6n,} ""áx‘i ""6n-yáwul Ä>m?n} š∞x} ""áwwa †éni páy6š n†ìra} tat-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘Well, I’ll come, only if the sheikh gives a
guarantee that this saddle bag will be guarded so that nothing will
happen to it.’ (A7:9)
(8) kúl-xa náša . . . yalúnka zór6t bàre} g8r6g páy6š m5mèðða gu-""ùmra.} ‘Everybody . . . when a young child is born, he must be baptized in the
church.’ (B6:9)
(9) hadíya mtánexi xa-tuní°a ""atìqta} p5šáwa mtun7°a gu-ma°wà°a.} ‘Now we
shall tell an old story, which used to be told in the villages.’
Constructions with the resultative forms of pyš such as hole piša q†ila / piš5le
q†ila ‘He has been killed / He is killed’ and piš5wa q†ila ‘He had been killed /
He was killed’ are equivalent in function to the passive resultative forms
hole q†ila / q†il5le and q†il5wa. The difference is that forms with pyš can only
function as passives whereas the forms with the copula could in principle
have a passive or active interpretation according to context. Speakers use
the constructions with pyš to eliminate this opacity of diathesis. In (10)
the motivation for using the unambiguously passive form pišewa ‘ide may
have been to distinguish it clearly from the active form ‘5diwaley in the
immediately preceding discourse:754chapter fifteen(10) kúlla ma°wá°a ‘5dìwaley.} m6n-kúlla ma°wá°6 t-íla marzabán6t ""Ón-Nùne,}
xa-tmánya ""6ßrà-ma°wa°a} náše píšewa ‘ìde.} ‘They invited all the villages. From all the villages that were adjacent to ""“n-Nune, eight
or ten villages, the people were invited.’ (B15:61)
Occasionally pyš is used with the resultative participle of intransitive verbs.
Such constructions are used to convey the sense that the subject referent is non-volitional and the event is caused to take place by an external
agent. This is in conformity with the pyš q†ila passive construction, which
in principle has a non-volitional subject who is the undergoer of the
action. In (11), for example, the construction pišla riqe is used to express
the fact that the inhabitants of the villages were forced to flee against their
will. The ‘active’ form riqla ‘they fled’, by contrast, would in principle be
interpreted as having a volitional subject.
(11) rába m6n-d-ánna ma°wà°a} píšla prìme} ""u-xákma píšla rìqe-u} píšla q†ìle.}
‘Many (of the inhabitants of ) these villages were slaughtered. Some
(were forced to) flee and were killed.’ (B1:2)
15.9.4. Resultative Participle Combined with ""°y
On some sporadic occasions the passive is expressed by a construction
consisting of a finite form of the verb ""°y ‘to come’ with the undergoer
as subject and a resultative participle, e.g.
(1)b-r6š-d-àyya bráta} réš6t bábe díye t-Zàlo} °éle twíra ràbe gáye.} ‘On account
of this girl, the head of his father Zàl was broken many times.’
(A29:39)15.9.5. Infinitive Combined with ""°y
In another type of periphrastic construction the verb ""°y ‘to come’ is
combined with the infinitive of the verbal stem that expresses the action.
This construction is of more restricted use than that the pyš + resultative
participle construction. In most of the recorded examples the verb is
negated. The infinitive may be preceded by the preposition l-, e.g.
(1)
(2)har-Dúre lˆ-""a°ya l-manšóye.} ‘Dure will never be forgotten.’ (B2:7)
""u-hál hadíya ""áwwa m6ndiyáne píšela l-bàl6n} ""u-lˆ-""a°i l-manšóye.} ‘Until
now these things remain in my mind and will not be forgotten.’
(B15:1)the syntax of verbs755The l- preposition is sometimes omitted, e.g.
(3) lágne lé-y-a°5 xzàda.} ‘Lagne are not harvested.’
(4) lá-kulla danáne kúlla †awalyá°a t-a°íwa m†awòle.} ‘Not all games would
be played at all times.’ (B11:1)
(5) ""á°e maxròpe.} ‘It is sharpened.’ (B11:17)
In (6) the instrument of the action is introduced by the preposition b-:
(6) ""ána hon-màra} ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘I say
that this head of mine will one day be cut off by your hands.’
(A14:35)
The construction may be used deontically to express deontic possibility
or obligation, e.g.
(7) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} la-""á°ya l-mtanòye.} ‘It is a long story. It cannot be
told.’ (A25:52)
(8) mèra mòdi qèßß6t?} tànil5ni!} mère là} l5-""á°ya mtanòye} xàf náše šmà""6ll5ni.}
‘They said “What is the story? Tell us!” He said “No. It cannot/must
not be told, lest people are listening.” ’ (A35:10–11)
15.9.6. Unaccusative Intransitive Verbs
Numerous verbal forms exhibit an alternation of transitive and unaccusative intransitive usage. These can be used transitively with a volitional
subject and an object complement that is the undergoer of the action or
alternatively can be used intransitively with the non-volitional undergoer
being made the grammatical subject. They are found in all verb stems
(for a set of such verbs in stem III see §8.17.2.).
The translation equivalent in English may be a verb that exhibits a
similar alternation, e.g.
""áw šmí†le kupàle.} ‘He broke his stick.’
""o-kupála šmì†le.} ‘The stick broke.’
""áw ßlíxle qˆsa.} ‘He split the wood.’
""o-q7sa ßlìxle.} ‘The wood split.’
núra q6m-qaméla ßùdri.} ‘The fire scorched my shirt.’
ßúdri qmèla.} ‘My shirt scorched.’756chapter fifteen
""áni q6m-xanqìle.} ‘They drowned him.’
""áw xnìqle.} ‘He drowned.’
""áw mkuwèrre ""9raq} ‘He distilled arak’
""8raq mkuwêrra.} ‘The arak distilled.’
""áw mukíšle gùða.} ‘He deflated the skin.’
gúða mukìšle.} ‘The skin deflated.’In some cases the transitive alternative must be translated by supplying
the matrix verb ‘to cause’ or a different lexical item, e.g.
""áw mujrè†le yàla.} ‘He caused the child to slip.’
""o-yála mujrê†le.} ‘The child slipped.’
""áw †ríxle nàša.} ‘He caused the man to lie flat.’
""o-náša †rìxle.} ‘The man lay down flat.’
""áw tlíxle bˆ°a.} ‘He destroyed the house.’
""o-b7°a tlìxle.} ‘The house collapsed.’
In many cases an unaccusative intransitive alternative of a transitive
verb is rendered idiomatically by an English passive. This applies, for
example, to the verbs q†a""a ‘to cut’, šqala ‘to take’, which are normally
used transitively:
(1) m6n-êdyo} malkù°a} m-bnónux q9†a.} ‘From today the kingship will be
cut off from your sons.’ (A8:96)
(2) mðíta b>yènna mbádla jálde kúlla ""ax-qamàye,} muxwàrta.} ""áwwa kóma šàq6l.}
‘(By) early morning I want all the town as (it was) before, made
white. Let the black be taken away.’ (A4:34)
Numerous other verbs exhibit this alternation, e.g.
g6lyále duzù°a.} ‘He revealed the truth.’
duzú°a glèla.} ‘The truth was revealed.’
páwxa q6m-mbalbèlle kàwse.} ‘The wind ruffled his hair.’
káwse mbulbèlle qam-pàwxa.} ‘His hair was ruffled by the wind.’
máw°6t mámi q6m-mzarzèli.} ‘The death of my uncle shook me.’
mzurzèli.} ‘I was shaken.’the syntax of verbs757q6m-qa†èrre gêšra.} ‘He complete the arch of the bridge.’
gèšra q†êrre.} ‘The arch of the bridge was completed.’
ß†imlux bˆ°i.} ‘You have devastated my house.’
""ána ß†ìmli.} ‘I am devastated.’
burb6zíli zùze.} ‘I scattered the money.’
zúze burbêzla.} ‘The money was scattered.’
q6m-mxa°xè°la x6zmayù°a.} ‘He renewed the family relationship.’
x6zmayú°a mxu°xêtla.} ‘The family relationship was renewed.’
The alternations described above are not restricted to past pefective forms,
as in the examples above, but apply also to forms with present or future
time reference and imperfective aspect.
Even when an unaccusative intransitive usage is available, a transitive
verb is sometimes made intransitive by the pyš q†ila construction, e.g.
(3) ""ína kupáli píšla šmì††a} ""u-piláwe píšla šmì†e.} ‘But my staff has broken
and my shoes have broken.’ (A37:17)
15.9.7. Diathesis of Causative Verbs
Causative forms of transitive verbs exhibit alternating diathesis. These
may either take as their grammatical object the agent of the action that
is being caused with the undergoer expressed as a second object or alternatively may take the undergoer of the action as the only grammatical
object, e.g.
q†ala ‘to kill’:maq†ole ‘to cause to kill’(1) q6m-maq†èlli xàwri.} ‘He [AGENT1] caused me [AGENT2] to kill my
friend [UNDERGOER].’
(2) q6m-maq†èlle xàwri.} ‘He [AGENT1] caused my friend [UNDERGOER] to be killed.’
When the grammatical object is the undergoer, as in (2), the caused action
is presented with passive diathesis. The agent who is caused to perform
the action need not be specified. If it is specified, it must be expressed
in a prepositional phrase, as is the case in (4), unless it is a reflexive construction (5):758chapter fifteen(3) bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.} maq6†làle gáw‰a.} ‘A woman is treacherous. She will
cause her husband to be killed.’ (A26:2)
(4) ""áwwa náša sáwa †la-mó q6m-maq6†lètle bìyi?} ‘Why did you cause that
old man to be killed by me?’ (A15:18)
(5) tre-†¬á-gaye mamxêxwala gán6n.} ‘We used to cause ourselves to be struck
two or three times.’ (B5:84)
15.9.8. Diathesis of Infinitives
An infinitive of a transitive verb that is subordinate to a matrix verb can
have active or passive diathesis. Examples of infinitives presented with
passive diathesis are (1)–(4), in which the agents of the action denoted by
the infinitive are not specified:
(1) °í°5la xa-bràta} mxáya ßáwla díya darmàna.} ‘A girl came in order for
her shoes to be rubbed with polish.’ (A16:2)
(2) muttúla ""ixála xàla.} ‘They served food to be eaten.’ (A15:11)
(3) ""áni kúlla b>yíwa maxóle ""u-maštòye.} ‘They all needed to be fed and
given drink.’ (B16:62)
(4) ""u-l5w6x naše t-manxope. ‘We are not people to be shamed.’ (C1:14)
15.9.9. Impersonal 3pl. Subject
When the agent of a transitive action is not specified, an active verb may
be given a 3pl. impersonal subject. Such constructions are often translated
idiomatically into English as passives, e.g.
(1) q6m-†arðíli m6n-bˆ°a.} ‘They drove me from the house = I was driven
from the house.’
(2) gu-Zàxo} bnáya w7wa xa-gêšra.} ‘In Zakho they were building a bridge
(= a bridge was being built).’ (C8:1–2)
(3) ""u-har-b6nyàla xá-gaya xéta.} ‘They have already built it (the village of
Dure) again (= It has already been built again).’ (B2:7)
(4) Qa†ina x6tn5le t-la-mbarxile. ‘Qa†ina is a groom without them wedding
him (= without being wed).’ (A50:15)
(5) be-palge sarxi d6mma. ‘They defile its middle with blood (= Its middle
is defiled by blood).’ (A52:22)
This use of an impersonal 3pl. subject is common in naming expressions
with the verb ""mr ‘to say’, e.g.","[791, 792, 793, 794, 795, 796, 797]"
"786chapter fifteen(1)y-oðíwale pùwuš.} j>míwale y-oðíwale qàpla.} ‘They made it into hay.

15.14. Indirect Objects
A nominal that has the function of the indirect object of an action, i.e.
one that refers to a participant who is a recipient or beneficiary in the
action, is expressed by attaching the preposition †la-/ta- or qa-. Unlike
direct object nominals, indirect object nominals normally do not have
any agreement element in the form of a pronominal copy on the verb,
even when the noun is definite, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l têrte tawriyá°a.} ‘He will give to your neighbour
two cows.’ (A3:4)
tèmm6l t-ámr6n ta-bàbi.} ‘Tomorrow I shall tell my father.’ (A18:7)
mèrt5la †la-d-áw-naša sáwa puš-b-šˆna!} ‘She said to that old man
“Remain in peace!” ’ (A8:69)On some rare occasions an agreement L-suffix is attested on the verb,
e.g.
(4)""ána t-àz6n} tanyánne ða-tuní°a †la-màlka.} ‘I shall go and tell a story
to the king.’ (A36:2)the syntax of verbs787As already described in §8.19.5., a pronominal indirect object of a verb
may be expressed by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase
consisting of the prepositions ""6ll-, †la- or qa- and a pronominal suffix. With
past base verbs the pronominal indirect object may also be expressed by
the inflection of the past base, e.g. mirále ‘He said to her’. Here we shall
examine in greater detail the distribution of these alternative devices in
the text corpus.
When there is no direct object, the pronominal indirect object may
usually be expressed either by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase. In such cases the ‘heavier’ prepositional phrase tends to be
used at the end of an intonation group (7–9) and avoided in the middle
of an intonation group following the verb (5–6). Included here are verbs
of saying followed by direct or indirect speech:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""álaha yállux b-àyya dúnye} ""u-b-5-xèta.} ‘May God grant you (bounty)
in this world and the next.’ (A21:44)
xáli lá ""amrètli qèßß6t d-áwwa qáßra mòdila?} ‘Uncle, will you not tell
me what the story of this palace is?’ (A25:67)
""ám6r ""èlle dìye.} ‘He says to him.’ (A21:2)
t-ámreti †làli.} ‘Tell me.’ (A21:43)
""ána mar6n-êllux.} ‘I say to you.’ (A17:34)A compound verbal form consisting of a resultative participle or an
infinitive without a clitic copula never takes L-suffixes. It usually takes a
cliticized ""6ll-phrase, e.g. hon híw6lle ‘I have given to him’, hon yaw6lle ‘I am
giving to him’. At the end of an intonation group this may be replaced
by an independent prepositional phrase with its own stress, e.g.
(10) hóle mára †làli.} ‘He says to me.’ (A17:10)
(11) ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi.} ‘She has been given to me.’ (A25:39)
When the verb has both a pronominal direct object and a pronominal
indirect object, the direct object is normally the primary object affix on
the verb and the indirect object is expressed by a prepositional adjunct
phrase, which in most cases follows the direct object affix, e.g.
(12) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ‘Let’s look for a
man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
(13) ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)788chapter fifteen(14) á¬óla sámma-w hallùle-lle.} ‘Fill it with poison and give it to him.’
(A26:86)
(15) b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} ‘Will you sell it to me if it has one
leg?’ (A22:5)
(16) xúwwe mà t-áw6ð b-an-álpa dáwe,} t-áz6n hawènna ""6lle-dìye?!} ‘What will
the snake do with the thousand gold coins that I should go and
give them to him?!’ (A1:8)
(17) xà°i,} Zìne,} hiwála ""êlli.} ‘My sister, Zine gave it to me.’ (A26:38)
(18) ""ána t-amrênna-llux.} ‘I shall tell it to you.’ (A21:35)
When the verb has a definite direct object nominal, this generally takes
an agreement in the form of a direct object pronominal affix and a pronominal indirect object must be expressed by an independent prepositional
phrase, which generally follows, e.g.
(19) bas-yátla Náze ""êlli.} ‘But you must give Naze to me.’ (A25:23)
(20) qá-mo le-yátla xá°ux ""êlle?} ‘Why won’t you give your sister to him?’
(A26:72)
(21) ""ána sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu.} ‘I shall give my portion to you.’ (A21:29)
(22) t8ra la-pa°xètle ""èlle dìye.} ‘Do not open the door to him.’ (A23:25)
(23) ""áwwa yála yíw6lle ""álaha ""èlla díya ""6štà yárxe.} ‘God gave them this
child six months ago.’ (A15:9)
In (24) there is a deviation from this usual rule, in that the indirect pronominal object is expressed by an L-suffix on the verb before the L-suffix
that agrees with the direct object nominal:
(24) hállila masr6q°ònti} ‘Give me my little comb’ (A34:3)
Occasionally a textually prominent indefinite direct object nominal takes
an agreement pronoun, e.g.
(25) ""áp-""awwa šaqèlla ðá-k6sta qa-d-ày,} yawèlla qa-d-ày.} ‘He also takes a
purse for her and gives it to her.’ (A4:22)
When a direct object nominal has no object agreement on the verb, the
pronominal indirect object is the primary affix on the verb, which is an
L-suffix in verb forms that take L-suffixes. The main circumstances in which
the direct object agreement element is omitted include the following:the syntax of verbs789(i) An indefinite direct object nominal
(26) ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n xa-bròna.} ‘Oh God, give us a son.’ (A15:17)
(27) hállule xa-sùsa.} ‘Give him a horse.’ (A12:59)
(28) mattúli xá-š6mma xèna.} ‘Give me another name.’ (A7:2)
(29) q7m6n šaqlènni xákma mèndi mènni b-""ìði.} ‘I shall get up and take for
myself a few things, with me in my hand.’ (A23:5)
(30) b>yánni ""èmma bnà°a.} ‘I want for myself a hundred girls.’ (A25:74)
(ii) A definite direct object that is an inalienable possession or closely
associated appurtenance of the referent of the indirect object
(31) híw6lla jùlla.} ‘He gave her clothes to her.’ (A14:84)
(32) hot-yàw6lle rèsqe díye} hóle xàla.} ""áp-""ana ßál6n dámx6n bˆ°a.} ""áti májbur
t-yàtli rèsqi.} ‘You are giving to it its sustenance and it is eating it. I
also shall go down and sleep at home. You will be obliged to give
me my sustenance.’ (A10:3)
(iii) A definite nominal that is a narrow focus
Agreement with a definite direct object is omitted on the verb if the object
constitutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may
be a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence, e.g.
(33) har-t-yàtli ða-bráta,} là?} mère hè.} mère yátli S6ttìye.} mère ma-yxàl6f,} t-yánnux S6ttìye.} ‘ “You will still give me a daughter, is that not so?’ ” He
said “Yes.” He said “You should give me S6ttiye (rather than one of
the others).” He said “Fine. I’ll give you S6ttiye.” ’ (A25:25)
(34) ""aláha hóle yíw6lli ""áyya ""ùrxa.} ‘God has given me this way.’ (A21:42)
Even when there is no direct object agreement suffix on the verb, the
indirect object can be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase.
This is found at the close of an intonation group to act as end-weighting, e.g.
(35) hátta m5xólta b-kàwe dár6x ""6lle-díye.} ‘We even give food to it through
the window.’ (A12:62)790chapter fifteenIt is also found where the speaker fronts the phrase to give the indirect
object prominence in order to set it in contrastive opposition to an indirect
object in an adjacent clause, e.g.
(36) ""6n-†lálux yáw6l xà xmára} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè xmáre.} ‘If he gives to
you one ass, he will give to your neighbour two asses.’ (A3:4)
(37) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘I have left nothing for you (whereas I
have taken everything for myself ).’ (A2:11)
At the end of a discourse unit the long alternative type of suffix construction for the expression of an indirect object is occasionally used on
compound verbal forms, whereby the copula element is placed after the
pronominal suffix. For the use of this construction with direct object suffixes for end-weighting see §15.13.5.:
(38) ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""è°ya kêsl6x.} ""6n-là mjuwèbla,} ""àtit °í°a kêsli.}
qrí°5la qála b-Šál6m ""u-Sùrma,} ‘u-jwába la-yìw6ll5la.} [< yiwa + 6lla
(3fs. indirect object) + ila (3pl. copula)] ‘ “If they answer you, then
indeed it is me who has come to you. If they do not answer you,
you have come to me.” She called Šalem and Surma, but they
did not give her any reply.’ (A26:4–5)
If a past base verb is used in the clause, an indirect pronominal object
tends to be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase in all circumstances, e.g.
(39) yíwla xa-q7sa xéna ""èlle dìye.} ‘She gave another stick to him.’
(A22:29)
(40) ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} ‘When God gave them a son . . .’
(A15:17)
(41) mêre ""èlle díye} ‘He said to him’ (A17:4)
(42) mère †làli} ‘He said to me’ (A22:8)
(43) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king replied to me thus.’ (A17:34)
(44) wídla f†árta ""êlli.} ‘She made breakfast for me.’ (A21:35)CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE SYNTAX OF PREPOSITIONS
The morphology and basic uses of the prepositions have been described
in §13.3. In this chapter we shall take a closer look at the syntax and
semantic range of the main prepositions, particularly those that have
multiple functions.
16.1. BThe preposition b- has a variety of uses. When it takes pronominal suffixes, these are attached to a longer base with the form biy-.
16.1.1. Spatial and Temporal Location
It may express location in a perceptible space in contexts such as the
following:
(1) šqíl5le q7sa b-""íðe dìye.} ‘He took the stick in his hand.’ (A22:30)
(2) ""o-yála zóra hóla mútt6lle be-pàlga.} ‘They put the small child in the
middle.’ (A4:58)
(3) w-ána b-ánna dašdàše-w} b-ánna ‘akàlle-w} ‘while I am in these plain
clothes and slippers’ (A6:7)
(4) šwíq6lla xáye bìy6x.} ‘He has left his life (which remained to him) in
you.’ (A4:42)
The preposition gu- is far more commonly used to express location within
an enclosed physical space, e.g. gu-xa-g6ppì°a} ‘in a cave’ (A15:1), gu-jˆbe}
‘in his pocket’ (A15:2), gu-Kàrkuk} ‘in Kirkuk’ (A16:1), gu-ða-mà°a} ‘in a
village’ (A48:1), gu-dudìya ‘in the cradle’ (A15:8). When the preposition
b- is used to refer to location in a physical space, this is generally less
physically enclosed, as in (1)–(4). It is more frequently used for location
in an abstract space, e.g. b-š7na b-†awà°a} ‘(You have come) in peace and
blessings’ (A15:8), b-xèlmi} ‘in my dream’ (A1:2), b-šóp6t bròn6n} ‘in the place
of our son’ (A4:39). The preposition b- expresses location within a state792chapter sixteenor activity in progressive constructions with infinitives, e.g. hóle b-°áya ‘He
is coming’ (A13:14), and occasionally other nouns.
It is used when a lesser degree of enclosure than in (1)–(4) is involved,
such that there is only surface contact, e.g. b-""ùrxa} ‘on the road’ (A15:1),
b-rèšux} ‘on your head’ (A23:8), b-miya šaxine ‘by warm waters’ (C2:54),
b-qðàli} ‘on my neck’ (A21:27).
In some cases it is used in an ingressive (5–8) or occasionally egressive
(9) sense:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)míya ßèlyela b-rešèy.} ‘The water came down onto their heads.’
(A16:11)
síqela b-xa-†ùra.} ‘They went up onto a mountain.’ (A17:4)
drí°a xêppo b-réša.} ‘She had put a veil on her head.’ (A19:2)
npílt5la b-xùbba.} ‘She has fallen in love.’ (A4:14)
mèšx6t qálya plí†le b-jebàne díye.} ‘The oil of the roast meat came out
of his pockets.’ (A23:9)The preposition gu- is likewise used in an ingressive or egressive sense,
e.g.
(10) wìrela gu-b7°a.} ‘They entered the house.’ (A15:7)
(11) zílela gu-ða-má°a xèta.} ‘They went into another village.’ (A15:10)
(12) síqela gu-xa-†ùra.} ‘They went up into a mountain.’ (A15:13)
(13) zèdy6lla gu-ða-dˆrta.} ‘They threw it into a house enclosure.’
(A15:12)
(14) šár†6n gu-""i°á°6 d-áwwa nàša.} ‘so that I escape from the hands of
this man.’ (A31:3)
(15) ""áti pál†6t gu-d-ànna.} ‘You should depart from these people.’
(A12:5)
Various nouns are used with b- in some contexts and with gu- in others,
as can be seen in the examples cited above. This should not necessarily
be interpreted as complete functional overlap, but rather is likely to reflect
different conceptualizations of the degree of enclosure involved, e.g.
b-xa-†ùra} ‘onto a mountain’ (A17:4)
gu-xa-†ùra} ‘into a mountain’ (A15:13)
gu-jˆbe} ‘in his pocket (hidden)’ (A15:2)
b-jebàne díye} ‘(from) in his pockets (revealed)’ (A23:9)the syntax of prepositions793b-""íðe dìye} ‘in his hand’ (A22:30)
gu-""i°á°6 ‘(from) in his hands (trapped)’ (A31:3).
The place through which one passes is also marked by b-, e.g.
(16) b-t8ra wìrt5la.} ‘It (the cat) entered by the door.’ (A23:19)
(17) táwre morètla b-kàwe.} ‘You should bring the oxen in through the
window.’ (A30:22)
The preposition b-, rather than gu-, is used to express location in a time
period, e.g. b-áyya dána ‘at this time’ (A15:7), b-lˆle ‘at night’ (A15:8), b-lˆle
b-yòma} ‘night and day’ (A21:2), b-""aßêrta} ‘in the evening’ (A22:31), b-q7†a
‘in the summer’ (B5:19), b-xarˆ°a} ‘at last’ (A22:5).
16.1.2. Instrument
It is often used in relation to the instrument or means by which an action
is performed. The complement is usually an inanimate object or a part
of the body, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)b-o n9ra} ""an-táwre dìye} mqudêqd5lel5y.} ‘He chopped the oxen up with
the axe.’ (A30:23)
xzáy6t6lla b-dùrbin.} ‘You see it with binoculars.’ (A25:52)
b6rzóma yá'ni ta-t-ßáli gu-gòma,} b-semàlta} ‘a hatch for them to go
down into the basement stable, by a ladder’ (A23:28)
zríy6nwale b-i°à°i.} ‘I had cultivated it with my hands.’ (A17:32)
""áyya kúlla q6m-max6rwàla} b-aqlá°a dìya.} ‘This (cat) has spoilt everything with its feet.’ (A23:19)Occasionally the complement is an animate referent, e.g.
(6)súq m7°i qˆsa biyéy.} ‘Go up and fetch wood with them (the asses).’
(A23:34)The expression waða b-xabra ‘to do by, according to the word (of so-andso)’ belongs here, e.g.
(7)""u-""èdyo ""áti lat-wáða b-xàbri.} ‘Today you are not doing as I say.’
(A21:43)794chapter sixteenUnder this head can be included phrases with the base b-gan- ‘by oneself ’,
e.g.
(8)ma-lat-ðáya b-gán6x qàr°5la?} ‘Don’t you know yourself that it is cold?’
(A20:1)
(9) wídla ""ixála ""áy b-gàna.} ‘She made the food by herself.’ (A21:40)
(10) y8ð6t b-gànux.} ‘You know by yourself.’ (A1:11)
Here also belong multiplicative expresses such as:
(11) ""áxni t-yawèxla xa-b-†¬à°a ""èlle díye.} ‘We shall give him threefold (if
it is lost).’ (A7:10)
16.1.3. ‘with’
On a number of occasions it is appropriate to translate the preposition
by English ‘with’. The relation may be comitative, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""á°i b-dáwla-w zórna-w tópe-w ‘Let them come with the drum and
pipe and with guns.’ (A4:33)
xáz6x ßèly5le b-xà †ena ""èxre} ""u-°éle b-†¬á°a †ène.} ‘We see that he went
down with one saddle bag of excrement and he has come back
with three saddle bags.’ (A7:12)
""ánna ma-t-íla xmíle b-©ðàðe!} ‘How happy they were with each other
(= together)!’ (A4:50)
""áyya bráta la-p7ša bìyux.} ‘This girl will not remain with you.’
(A29:33)
""i-xo†íla b-mêšxa.} ‘They mix them with oil.’ (B6:51)
""an-tre-maláxe t-w7wa ""è°ye bìya} ‘those two angels who had come with
her (= had brought her)’ (A4:44)It is also used to express various other types of association or linkage,
e.g.
(7)
(8)lìtl6n šúla bíye.} ‘We have no business with it (= It is not our business).’ (A48:6)
""aláha hole-mìra} t-yawêllux} b-šàr†} kú-mdit yawêllux} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l
trè.} ‘God has said that he will give to you with the condition that
everything he gives to you he will give to your neighbour twofold.’
(A3:4)the syntax of prepositions795(9)""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n,} wíra b-šênne.} ‘I am an old man, advanced in
age.’ (A8:43)
(10) mol6xmáli . . . ""áyya zmárta bíye dìye.} ’I composed this song about him.’
(C4:2)
(11) naša go‰a b-š6nne ‘a man big with regard to years (= an elderly
man)’16.1.4. Attributive
The preposition sometimes has the function of linking a referent to a
nominal that is presented as an attribute, in that it constitutes a component or property of it. e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)m6n-d-ànna} pazesór b-""6lyà°a,} hátxa b-qanàne} ‘Some of those big sheep
with fat tails and horns (big) like this’ (A7:22)
""ána làn b-xá-reša} b-šàwwa reš>wá°6n.} ‘I do not have just one head,
I have seven heads.’ (A24:41)
""ána b-zawnènne ""6n-háwe b-tèrte ""aqlà°a.} ‘I shall buy it if it has two
legs.’ (A22:9)
w-aßèrta m5°êtli} xá-qapla qˆse} t-lá-hawa b-qàlpe.} ‘In the evening bring
me a bundle of pieces of wood that are without bark.’ (A30:6)
wél6x hawnànta,} b-""iqár6t ßáw°a basìmta,} ""u-màqul.} ‘You have been
clever, with the honour of sweet and fine words.’ (A40:16)
b-ràxme!} ‘(May you be) with mercy! (= Bless you!)’ (A4:60)
†¬á-mma xatáne b-xa xerìya.} ‘Three hundred ladies with one veil.’
(D1:9)
barða b-qanane ‘hail with horns (= heavy hail)’We should classify here attributive expressions such as the following:
b-xamme ‘sad’, b-xaye ‘alive’, b-†ali ‘ill’, b-palxana ‘busy’ (§11.7.).
16.1.5. Material
It is occasionally used to denote the material out of which something is
made, e.g.
(1)t-oðètli gèšra b-qˆsa.} ‘Make me a bridge of wood.’ (A17:18)796chapter sixteen16.1.6. Price
It denotes the price at which an item is fixed either in an amount of
money or a bartered object, e.g.
(1) xá-kilo ""èxre b-†¬á°a dàw5le.} ‘One kilo of dung sells for three gold
pieces.’ (A7:14)
(2) ""ána zonènna b-""êßra.} ‘I shall buy it for ten (dinars).’ (B5:42)
(3) xál6t xètna q6m-zawènna ""ilána b-xamšì dináre.} ‘The maternal uncle of
the groom has bought it (the tree) for a hundred dinars.’ (B15:68)
(4) l-Yaws6p zwinta b-neriya. ‘It has been bought by Yaws6p for a male
goat.’ (B8:28)
Conversely it is used before the item sold in expressions such as (5):
(5) y-a°éwa zonàna,} y-amêrwa} ""àyya} ""àtxa b-yawènnux bíya díya.} ‘A purchaser
would come and say “I shall give you such-and-such (an amount
of money) for them (the apples).” ’ (B15:52)
16.1.7. Manner
It may express the manner in which an action is performed. In such cases
it is generally combined with an abstract nominal, e.g.
(1) maßl7l6n b-iqàra.} ‘They bring us down with honour.’ (A4:30)
(2) b8y6n lá-""a°i b-xàšša.} ‘I do not want them to come in sadness.’
(A4:33)
(3) ""áni b-x7la b8yi mbarxíla ""êlli.} ‘They want to marry her to me by
force.’ (A7:18)
(4) bás ""amrêtli} b-duzù°a} dàx ""áyya bráta wiðálux brát6t b7°a.} ‘Just tell me,
in truth, how have you made this girl a housewife.’ (A21:34)
16.1.8. Causal Background
Occasionally it expresses the cause or purpose of an action, e.g.
(1) ""ám6r b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Was it for this (reason) you sent for me?’
(A21:32)
(2) zílle b-ríx6t k>bàbe,} xzéle mdaxóye xmàre.} ‘He went after the smell of
kebabs, but he found the branding of asses.’ (D2:30)the syntax of prepositions797(3) l7w6t ""àti} ""5-bráta t-in-""ána wíð6lla gáni kóra b-rèš6x,} mèxy6lla ""urêdxa}
gu-""ˆni?} ‘Are you not the girl on account of whom I made myself
blind, by puttinng the needle into my eye?’ (A16:7)
16.1.9. Oath
The preposition is used in oaths or adjurations before the item by which
the speaker is swearing, e.g.
(1) mèra b-rèšux.} ""áti mútt6t-6lle tàma.} ‘She said “(I swear) by your head.
You put him there.” ’ (A22:39)
The preposition is most frequently used with this function before the
noun ""alaha ‘God’ in the phrase b-álaha, which is usually stressed on the
first syllable and often pronounced [b-a[la]. This expression is used in a
variety of contexts. In general it strengthens an assertion, by committing
the speaker fully to the truth of the statement, e.g.
(2) b-álaha ""áwwa xoš-yàl5le.} ‘By God, he is a good lad.’ (A21:5)
(3) b-álaha d°s-it.} ‘By God, you are right.’ (A17:19)
It is often used to introduce the response to a question, e.g.
(4) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” “By God, I’m
looking for my sustenance.” ’ (A20:1)
(5) há bròni,} m-ˆk6t °áya?} b-álaha m-bˆ°6n °áya,} ""àmti.} ‘‘ ‘Hey, my son,
where are you coming from?” “By God, I’m coming from home,
aunt.” ’ (A23:2)
(6) mèra mòdila qèßß6t díya?} mère b-álaha qèßß6t díya hàtx5la.} ‘She said “What
is her story?” He said “By God, her story is like this.” ’ (A4:14)
It is used to strengthen a remonstration expressed by a negative question,
e.g.
(7) b-álaha látwa mìrta} la-h7w6n ""u-lá b6‰-náša ""áw6r gu-""òt6x?} ‘By God, did
you not say that no animal and no person should enter the room?’
(A23:22)798chapter sixteen16.1.10. Complements of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition b- is used as the complement of some verbs, e.g. dbaša
b- ‘to stick to’, dqara b- ‘to touch’, mbaxole b- ‘to envy’, mhaymone b- ‘to
believe in’, mparoje b- ‘to look at’, tfaqa b- ‘to meet’, †paya b- ‘to catch
onto (fire)’, parpore b- ‘to plead to’, qya°a b- ‘to hit’, tpara b- ‘to threaten’,
xðaya b- ‘to rejoice in’, xkaka/gxaka b- ‘to laugh at’, xqara b- ‘to honour’,
xyara b- ‘to look at’. It is also used as the obligatory complement of some
attributive expressions, e.g. bista b- ‘familiar with’, bliga b- ‘busy with’, x6ðya
b- ‘pleased with’.
Several verbs may take a direct object complement or a complement
introduced by the preposition b-. In general the construction with the
prepositional complement is used to express a situation in which the action
affects the referent to a lesser extent than when a direct complement is
used, or a situation in which the action is less directly associated with the
referent. Some pairs are given below by way of illustration:
ðaya + object ‘to know, understand (sth., so. by direct knowledge)’, ðaya
b-‘to know about (sth. so. indirectly)’, e.g.
(1) y6ðènne ""á°‰6t bàbi.} ‘I know the land of my father.’ (A14:90)
(2) hé b-àlaha,} qídle b7°6t duglàna-w} ""áxni là-ðiye bíye.} ‘Oh, by God, the
house of the liar has burnt down, without us knowing about it.’
(A48:7)
mxaya + object ‘to strike’, mxaya b- ‘to play (a musical instrument)’, e.g.
(3) lá maxênn6x.} ‘I shall not strike you.’ (A51:19)
(4) ""Ašeba†àlo} ""áwwa máxe b-zòrna.} ‘Ašeba†alo played the pipe’ (A25:26)
mšaxlope + object ‘to change’, mšaxlope b- ‘to exchange’, e.g.
(5) ta-mšaxèlpi šèmm6t ’ùxo} ‘in order for them to change the name ’uxo’
(A7:3)
(6) mšuxlèpla b-is6qyà°a.} ‘They exchanged rings.’ (A4:5)
zmara + object ‘to sing (a song)’, zmara b- ‘to sing to (so.)’, e.g.
(7) ""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘They used to sing rawe.’ (B15:75)
(8) zmírre b-Zìne.} ‘He sang to Zine.’ (A25:22)the syntax of prepositions799xala + object ‘to eat (completely)’, xala b- ‘to eat (parts of sth.)’, e.g.
(9) xílela xa-ràmša.} ‘They ate dinner.’ (A16:9)
(10) ""u-rípel6lle kùlla,} nyása-w xàla ""èbbe-diye.} ‘They (the animals) all
attacked him, biting and eating bits of him (= gnawing him).’
(A35:21)
Some verbs can take a direct object or another preposition but use b- before
a referent that is disadvantaged in some way by the action, e.g.
(11) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why have you done this to me?’
(A15:14)
(12) xzi-málka bt-áw6ð bìyi.} ‘See, the king will do (something) to me.’
(A21:33)
(13) ""áp-""ana šqiláli š6ndùxta} d6ryáli bìya.} ‘I picked up a small stone and
threw it at it.’ (A23:22)
(14) ""áp-xa l5le-mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘Nobody could (do anything) against her
(= nobody could defeat her).’ (A25:68)
(15) šuréla ßráxa bíye dìye.} ‘She started shouting at him.’ (A25:82)
(16) bálki t-íle xa-mèndi °í°a bìya.} ‘Perhaps something has happened to
her.’ (A21:25)
The preposition with the sense of ‘disadvantage’ is found after the existential particle in expressions such as:
(17) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured. Nothing is the matter with
me.’ (A4:20)
With some verbs the preposition b- may be exchanged for other prepositions to express a different relationship to the complement. In (18), for
example, the verb xyara ‘to look’ takes a complement with b- (‘look at’),
but in the second clause the complement has gu- to express ‘looking into’
the enclosed interior of the cave:
(18) qamáye xírta b-áql6t súsa dìya,} la-xírra gu-gêppa.} ‘At first she looked at
the legs of her horse, she did not look into the cave.’ (A8:72)800chapter sixteen16.1.11. b6d-, budThe expression b6d- and its variant bud- is in origin a combination of the
preposition b- and the subordinating particle D. It is not, however, used
with exactly the same distribution as the basic preposition b-. It generally has the sense of ‘about, concerning’, which is not a meaning that is
generally expressed by b- alone, e.g.
(1)(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)""6n-xá-naša m7°elaxu xàbra} b6d-bròni,} kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a
""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘If somebody brings you word
about my son—whoever brings me word about my son, whether
he is dead or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
""ánna šèmye-wawa b6d-M8mo m6n-Zìne.} ‘They had heard about M>mo
from Zine.’ (A26:25)
šmìla bud-díye.} ‘They heard about him.’ (A21:5)
lá taxmènn6n ""ána b6d-z6ndàna.} ‘I shall not think about prison (= I
don’t care about prison).’ (A26:44)
náše spáy t-y8ði bud-màrra} ‘fine people who know about the illness’
(A8:32)
qím6n molèxm6nna ""ánna šére bud-dìye.} ‘I composed these verses about
him.’ (C4:3)
b6d-""áwwa náša tàlx6x.} ‘Let’s destroy with regard to this man (= let’s
get rid of this man).’ (A30:41)Elsewhere the phrase is occasionally used to denote relations that are
expressed by the basic b- preposition, including causal (‘because of, on
account of ’), instrumental (‘through the means of ’) and comitative (‘with’),
e.g.
(8)bud-àyya mu°7lux ""ánna zúze.} ‘Because of this you have brought these
coins.’ (A1:27)
(9) rába ""ítley xayú°a basímta b6d-àyya,} yá'ni zrát6t xabùše.} ‘They had a
very good life on account of this, that is the cultivation of apples.’
(B5:106)
(10) y-axlíwa lèxma bêd-an q7se.} ‘They would eat bread through the means
of (the sale of ) this wood.’ (A14:10)
(11) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘This head of mine
will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
(12) qímla k°úla xa-k°àwa,} mšudèrra b6d-qàz6d.} ‘She wrote a letter and
sent it by a messenger.’ (A11:17)the syntax of prepositions801(13) l5šále bàxta,} b6d-míya mênne.} ‘A woman kneads it, together with
water.’ (B5:100)
In addition it is found in a few fixed expressions, e.g.
(14) qím5le híw6lla bná°e dìye} †la-d-an-nàše,} b6d-xá†6r d-ó-xona zòra.} ‘He gave
his daughters to those people on account of that young brother.’
(A12:22)
(15) har-dmíxt5la b6d-lèbba gu-b7°6t bába dìy5la.} ‘She continued sleeping,
thinking that she was in her father’s house.’ (A21:18)
16.1.12. Combined with Other Prepositions
The preposition b- is often combined with the locative preposition reš‘upon’, e.g.
(1)
(2)hóle dèrya jùlla b-réša.} ‘He put a cloth over them.’ (A25:48)
qím5le zíla mútta ""án-julla díya gu-d-o-sandùqa,} mútt6lla gu-""asàs6t b7°a,}
""u-bèny5le gùda b-réše.} ‘He put her clothes in a box and placed it in
the foundations of the house, then built a wall over it.’ (A14:99)
16.2. L-This preposition has a wide variety of functions. One reason for this is
that it is derived from two different prepositions in earlier Aramaic, namely
*l-‘to, for’ and *'al ‘upon’. Generally the usage of l- in the dialect makes it
clear from which of these two earlier prepositions it is derived in any one
particular case. In some cases, however, the derivation is not completely
certain. For this reason all the usages of l- are here treated together. It is
important, furthermore, to make a distinction between the adnominal uses
of l- and the adpronominal forms. Various possibilities exist for pronominalizing a phrase consisting of l + nominal. These include the L-suffixes
and independent phrases consisting of ""6ll- + pronominal suffixes. Each
of these pronominal forms has a restricted usage and is not found in all
contexts that l + nominal phrases are used.","[824, 825, 826, 827, 828, 829, 830, 831, 832, 833, 834, 835, 836, 837, 838, 839, 840]"
"772chapter fifteen(8)""a-másta marˆla.} mátti š-nùra-w} šáxna-w d7r5 marˆ°a.} ‘They congeal
the yoghurt, they put it on the fire, it warms up and they add a
congealing agent (rennet).’ (B5:65)
(9) ""u-""áyya har-šaqláwa m6n-d-àn šíše} mattàwa} ""èlla dìya.} ‘She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron bars and putting them
into her.’ (A19:6)
(10) yáw6xley xá‘‘a kèke} madúq6x b-iðèy.} ‘We shall give them some cakes,
making them hold them in their hands.’ (A8:11)
(11) ta-t-kút-yom xà-maßla kèsla díya,} madêmxa kèsla} ‘in order that she could
bring somebody to her every day and cause him to lie with her.’
(A4:51)
(12) y-áw6ð xà-†ena,} trè-†ene q7se,} y-á°e mzabènwa †la-d-àw-u yèmme díye.}
‘He made one or two loads of wood, and would come back and
sell them for himself and his mother.’ (A14:10)
A pronominal direct object is often omitted on the verb ‘to give’ ( yawa)
when its referent is understood from the context, e.g.
(13) bábi náb6lla gu-jàma} hàlle!} ‘Father, take them to the mosque and
give them to him!’ (A17:11)
(14) mère xa-sùsa} ""ánna xamšà šènne} ""áp-xa l7le mèßya mè†ya ""èlle dìye.} . . . d6-hálli
""àna t-ásq6n.} ‘He said “There is a horse that for these five years
nobody has been able to get near.” . . . He said “King, may you
be in good health, give it to me, I shall go up (and ride it).” ’
(A12:62–63)
(15) ""ána l7-yaw6nne ""àp-xa-f6lsa} . . . xíš5le l-bˆ°a} l7le-hiwa ""àtxa.} ‘ “I shall
not give him a penny” . . . He went to the house and did not give
(any of the money) and that was that.’ (A1:8–9)
(16) qímt5la báxta zílta †lìbt6lla.} hal-jálde jàlde mèra} ‘The wife went and
requested it. “Give it quickly,” she said.’ (A5:8)
A pronominal object is generally omitted on the imperative of šqala ‘to
take’ when the referent is perceptible in the speech situation, e.g.
(17) ha-šqùl,} máttula t>màha.} ‘Here, take them, put them over there.’
(A6:3)the syntax of verbs77315.13.2. Direct Object Nominal
When the object is a nominal, it is not usually combined with any
object marker, but the verb frequently has a pronominal object that is
co-referential with it. The occurrence of this pronominal object agreement is conditioned primarily by the status of the object nominal, the
usual situation being that a definite object nominal has object agreement whereas an indefinite one lacks it. The distribution of the object
agreement is also affected by the pragmatic relation of the nominal to
the other elements in the clause and the status of the clause within the
surrounding discourse.
15.13.2.1. Definite Direct Object Nominals
When the object nominal is definite, the verb normally has a pronominal
object that agrees with it. This applies both to object nominals placed
after the verb and those placed before the verb. Examples from the text
corpus:
Present base verbs
(1) mattúla kàrte.} ‘He lays down his load.’ (A15:3)
(2) ""ína xazyála Lelì°a.} ‘She sees Leli°a.’ (A19:8)
(3) mère šaqlèxle bronéy ta-t-taxríle ""álaha xá-ga xèta.} ‘He told us to take their
son so that they remember God again.’ (A15:17)
(4) t-axlènne lèxmi hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n.} ‘I shall eat my bread until the day
I die.’ (A15:21)
(5) °éle xa-náša q6m-šaqèlle ""o-kàrmi.} ‘A man came and took away my
orchard.’ (A17:30)
(6) bás †6pp6ryá°a q6m-xazyàla kál°a.} ‘But the daughter-in-law saw her
finger-nails.’ (A19:2)
(7) ""èrb6t xwáre p5rmìwale-u} ‘They used to slaughter the sheep.’ (B5:7)
(8) ""6n-lá-""awð6t b-xábra dìyi} gánux šaqlênna.} ‘If you do not do as I tell

cradle.’ (A15:8)774chapter fifteen(10) wúr gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a.} óúmle t8ra bàrux.} ‘Go into this room. Close the
door behind you.’ (A22:26)
(11) mpál6†la zùzi!} ‘Bring out my money!’ (A15:3)
Past base forms
(12) ""àwwa} munšìle zúze díye.} ‘He forgot his money.’ (A15:1)
(13) mpul†íla táwra-w xmàra.} ‘She got out the ox and the ass.’ (A21:23)
(14) †¬á-bnone xilìli.} báxta xilàli} ‘I have eaten the three sons. I have eaten
the wife.’ (A20:12)
(15) ""áp-ay ""áqla primàli} ‘I cut off also that leg.’ (A22:9)
Compound verbal forms
(16) šqíl6lla †ása b-lˆle.} ‘They took the bowl in the night.’ (A15:12)
(17) mx5lált6lla ""ay-dùk°a.} ‘She cleaned that place.’ (A17:27)
(18) ""ína bróna lˆla xílt6lle.} ‘But she did not eat the boy.’ (A19:7)
(19) šuréla manšóy6lle ""alàha.} ‘They began to forget God.’ (A15:17)
(20) súse díye mtaslóm6lle †la-xolàma.} ‘He handed over his horse to the
servant.’ (A12:8)
The pronominal agreement with a definite nominal object does not occur
in certain situations, which may be classified as follows.
(i) Inalienable Possession
The agreement on the verb is occasionally omitted when the referent of
the object nominal lacks distinctness from the subject referent due to its
being an inalienable appurtenance or possession of the subject, usually a
body part or the reflexive expression gan- ‘self ’, e.g.
(21) šám6† qðále dìye.} ‘Let him break his neck.’ (A15:13)
(22) si-mxi-""áqlux gu-xáße díye. ‘Go and kick his back.’ (A15:13)
(23) m†áši gànux!} ‘Hide yourself !’ (A22:29)
(24) ""ána majbúr-iw6n t-áz6n qá†l6n gáni pálx6n w-áy dmíxta maxlênna?} ‘Was
I obliged to kill myself working to feed her while she slept?’
(A21:38)
This, however, is only a tendency and on several occasions the agreement
pronoun occurs on the verb with such objects, e.g.","[810, 811, 812, 813]"
"the syntax of nominals465(1)b-lˆlela,} plí††5la zìlt5la} xzí°6lle xa-nàša.} ‘(When) it was night, she

(7) ""u-šaqláwa qúrb6 l-""árbi, xamšì yomá°a.} ‘It would take about forty or
fifty days.’ (B5:12)
(8) mèdre ""i-zamríwa-w šatˆwa} hál y-oráwa gu-lˆle.} ‘They again sang

by and then the king said to his wife . . .’ (A4:38)
(11) y-oráwa kèma yàrxe.} ‘Several months would pass.’ (B5:18)
(12) pal†a-bàh6r} y-oðèxwa ""ùpra.} ‘When Spring came, we would collect
the mud.’ (B10:68)
In (9)–(12) the fs. verb forms appear to take the following plural nouns as
their grammatical subject, but they should be interpreted as referring to
the general temporal situation: ‘(Time) went by (for) two or three months,
four months’, etc.
14.2.4. Object Pronoun
In a number of expressions a 3fs. object pronoun on a verb has no clear
referent. The purpose of this otiose object appears to be to denote the
telicity of the verb. In (1), for example, the verb phrase mtagbêrra denotes
that the man administers something and achieves a result, whereas the
form mtagb6r without the object could be construed as non-telic, denoting466chapter fourteenthat he administers without necessarily achieving a result. In (2) the verb
q6m-jarála denotes not only that the cat engaged in the activity of urinating,
but also that it completed the activity, fully emptying its bladder. The same
applies to the act of defacation in (3). In (4) and (5) the object pronoun
conveys the sense of finality in the act of surrender.
(1) bíš-y>ðe mtagbêrra.} ‘He knows better how to deal with things.’
(A30:2)
(2) qá†u krìbla,} q6m-jarála gu-nùra.} ‘The cat was angry and urinated in
the fire.’ (A34:8)
(3) kút-ile xíl6lla xa-ràmši-m6ndi} gu-bˆ°i} ""á°e xarèla gu-b7°i.} ‘Everyone who
has eaten my dinner or the like (i.e. any food) in my house, let him
come and defecate in my house.’ (A7:5)
(4) lá q6m-mattúla qam-màlka.} ‘He did not surrender to the king.’
(A27:1)
(5) m-xúwwe hon-muxêrw6lla.} ‘I have wrecked it with the snake’ (i.e. I
have wrecked my relationship). (A1:10)
An intransitive verb may be given a complement of a prepositional phrase
containing a 3fs. non-referential pronominal suffix. Again the effect is to
express telicity and hence greater salience and force, e.g.
(6) ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya.} ‘I have absolutely gone with it!’ (i.e. I am
finished!) (A14:25)
14.2.5. Meteorological Expressions
In some expressions relating to the weather a 3fs. inflection is used without any explicit subject, e.g. tèmm6l rìt5la} ‘Yesterday it rained’, bt-àrya} ‘It
will rain’, ""èdyo šaxìnta} ‘Today it is hot’. In such cases the subject should
be understood as the feminine noun dunye ‘world, weather’, which is
used in other meteorological expressions such as dúnye ràya} ‘It is raining’,
dúnye šaxìnta} ‘It is hot’, dúnye x6mmànta} ‘It is hot’. Note also expressions
of temperature such as (1)–(3), where the implicit subject again can be
interpreted as dunye:
(1) q6m-x>ðíla hátxa t-la-q5ralèy.} ‘They wrapped them up, like this, so
that they would not be cold.’ (A8:12)
(2) wít5la xá‘‘a b-yóma xêmma.} ‘It became rather hot during the day.’
(A14:68)the syntax of nominals
(3)467ta-t-óya šaxínta b-sètwa ""6llèy.} ‘So that it will be warm for them in
the winter.’ (B14:9)
14.3. Demonstrative Pronouns14.3.1. Preliminary Remarks
The demonstrative pronouns may qualify a noun or stand independently.
When they qualify a noun, they are regularly placed before the noun, e.g.
""áwwa gáw‰a ‘this man’, ""áyya báxta ‘this woman’, ""ánna náše ‘these people’,
etc. They may be combined with nouns that have possessive pronominal
suffixes, e.g. ""áwwa ""êrbi ‘this sheep of mine’ (A10:3), ""áwwa bˆ°ux ‘this house
of yours’ (A11:11), ""áw kawsèy ‘that hair of theirs’ (A8:14), ""aw-n9re ‘that
axe of his’ (A14:12), ""o-q7se dìye ‘its wood’ (B5:84), ""áy bráti ‘that daughter
of mine’ (A40:10), ""5-brat7ni ‘that daughter of ours’ (A21:25), ""áyya róxi ‘this
soul of mine’ (A26:82), qu-s7 k6s-d-anna-šwàw6n} ‘Go to these neighbours
of ours’ (A5:1).
Independent demonstrative pronouns may stand in any syntactic position in a clause, including subject, predicate, direct object of a verb or
complement of a preposition or particle. In the majority of attested cases
they are in subject position:
(i) Subject
(1) ""aw-tíw5le xaràya.} ‘He sat last (in the queue).’ (A17:31)
(2) xa-bèna,} dmìx5le ""áw.} ‘Then he went to sleep.’ (A24:40)

The independent demonstrative pronouns function as 3rd person personal
pronouns. The distribution of the independent demonstrative pronouns
is wider than that of 1st and 2nd person personal pronouns, which can
occupy the subject, direct object or predicate positions of clause, but cannot be the complement of prepositions.
14.3.2. The Function of the Demonstrative Pronouns
When examining the function of the demonstrative pronouns a distinction should be made between their use to refer to visible objects in the
extra-linguistic speech situation and their use to refer to referents withinthe syntax of nominals469the discourse. As indicated in §7.4., when used to refer to extra-linguistic
objects the pronoun system can be said to be ‘hearer orientated’, in that the
deictic centre for all pronouns is the hearer. It consists of three series:
‘speaker deixis’
‘far deixis’
‘default’""áwwa k°áwa ‘this book (near me)’
"">wáha k°áwa ‘that book (remote from me and
you)
""o-k°awa ‘that book (with you)’The far deixis form may be intensified by replacing the /a/ with /a""/ in
the stressed syllable: "">wá""ha k°áwa ‘that book (very remote from me and
you).
Examples from the text corpus:
(1) qu-šqúlla ""áyya skìnta.} ‘Get up and take this knife.’ (A15:8)
(2) yába là dámx6x gu-d-áwwa qáßra.} dámx6x l-w9d6r.} ‘Let’s not sleep in
this palace. Let’s sleep outside.’ (A12:11)
(3) y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha †úra.} ‘We shall go up and fetch water
from that mountain over there.’ (A39:9)
(4) réšux mattánne gu-d-yàha káwe} t-íla pyàša.} ‘I shall put your head in
that opening over there that remains.’ (A25:62)
(5) mère kˆle b7°a díya?} ""aw-xášu xa-badêkk5le.} mêra "">wá""ha qáßra t-it-xzày6lle.}
‘He said “Where is her house?” He thought it was a hut. They said
“That villa that you can see over there.” ’ (A40:11)
(6) mè†y5le xa-káwt6t ""êrwe,} ""íbe tre-†¬á°a ""álpa rēš-""êrwe.} q6m-qaréla ""an-šavàne}
mère d-ˆnila ""an-""èrwe?} ‘He came to a flock of sheep, in which there
were two or three thousand head of sheep. He called the shepherds
and said “Whose are those sheep (which are in your keeping)?”’
(A32:14)
(7) šqíl6lla qamáye ðá-kista dàwe.} mère ""áy †làl6x} . . . mjun6gníla hàtxa.} . . . mère
. . . ""íman t-à°y6t,} ða-kista-xéta max-d-áy yawênn6x.} ‘He first took out a
purse of gold pieces. He said “This is for you” . . . She shook them
like this . . . He said . . . “When you come back, I’ll give you another
purse like that one (you are holding).”’ (A4:15–16)
(8) kúlla ""an-waríð6x q>†ênna.} ‘I shall cut all those roots of yours.’
(A25:64)
(9) ""ay-mòdila?} ‘What is that (by you)?’ (A21:8)
The structually least complex form, which is designated here as ‘default’,
is used when the item is with the hearer in the deictic centre. Since it is in470chapter fourteenthe deictic centre, it does not have a deictic function, i.e. it does not point
the attention of the hearer to a specific point in the surrounding environment. Rather it simply indicates that the item in question is identifiable
somewhere in the accessible situation of the hearer. It would be, in fact,
more accurate to translate it simply by the English definite article, which,
likewise, is non-ostensive. The ‘speaker deixis’ and ‘far deixis’ forms, on
the other hand, have ostensive force and point the attention of the hearer
to a specific point in the environment.
Several NENA dialects have only two series of demonstratives. These
consist of a speaker deixis form and a default form. e.g. J. Arbel:
Speaker deixis
""iyyaDefault
""oThe speaker deixis form form always points to a specific point close to
the speaker. The default form may be used in a deictic or non-deictic
sense. When used in a deictic sense, it expresses ‘far deixis’, pointing to
an item that is remote from the speaker and hearer. When used in its
non-deictic sense, it does not point the hearer’s attention to any specific
point but simply indicates that the referent is identifiable somewhere in
the environment (cf. Khan 1999: 208–219). It has this non-deictic sense
when it refers to an item that is with the hearer. This two pronoun system
consisting of a speaker deixis and default form is more archaic than the
three pronoun system that is found in C. Barwar and numerous other
NENA dialects. The three pronoun system developed by creating a new
form to take over from the default form to express far deixis. As a result,
the original default form now only has a non-deictic sense.
When used to refer to items within the discourse rather than to items
in the extra-linguistic situation, demonstrative pronouns generally have
an anaphoric function, i.e. they form a referential link with some item
elsewhere, usually earlier, in the discourse. Of the three series of pronouns,
it is the default (""o-k°awa) and speaker deixis (""awwa k°awa) forms that are
most frequently used with this anaphoric function. The default form, as
is the case when used to refer to extra-linguistic items, does not point to
any specific place in the discourse, but simply indicates that the referent
of the item is accessible somewhere in the discourse environment, typically
in the discourse history. The nearest functional equivalent in English is
the definite article, which is often the most natural translation. It is used
with a nominal, for example, when the referent of the nominal has been
explicitly mentioned in the preceding discourse, e.g.","[503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509]"
"870chapter seventeen(13) har-""àtit plíxa.} ‘Only you have worked.’ (A21:15)
(14) kúlla hóla q†ìle.} bas-àn6n šrí†a.} ‘They have all been killed. Only I

(15) har-""àxni bt-áxl6x.} ‘Only we shall eat.’ (A21:15)

(17) ""ap-""àna hów6n zála †8ya bá°6r ˙aqqú°a ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘I also am going
to search for what is lawful and what is unlawful.’ (A15:6)
17.7.4.2. Postposed Subject Pronouns
Independent subject pronouns are on some occasions postposed after the
verb or copula predicate. This construction expresses greater continuity
and cohesion with the preceding discourse than the construction where
the pronoun stands before the verb.
In many cases the motivation for this additional coding appears to be
to give prominence to the clause as a whole, due to its importance or
unexpectedness. Sometimes the prominent clause is the final one of a
series, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)""ána spayù°6n wáða,} ""u-""èdyo m†éli ""ána làxxa.} ‘I was doing good and
today I have come here.’ (A14:34)
""ày} ""u-xolamwà°a} kúlla rqáða ©ðáðe zmàra,} mára xa-'>b≈d kòma} dmáx5la
mènne díye ""ày.} ‘She and her servants all danced and sang together.
She slept with a black slave.’ (A13:8)
""í° xa-yàla,} ""ána mquwált6n mênne} g8r6g gawrànne,} g8r6g d7‰6n ""ána
l-tàma.} ‘There is a young man. I gave him a promise and I must
marry him, I must return there.’ (A14:86)
hey-nàša} la-""àz6t} ""á°e mtalèxlux ""àw.} ‘Don’t go, man. He will come
and destroy you.’ (A14:65)
m-ˆka q6m-y>ðètli ""áti t-íw6n Gozáli?} ‘How did you know that I was
Gozali?’ (A8:41)
xóni dàw6qlux} darélux gu-z6ndàna,} gu-hàbsa.} mère lá taxmènn6n ""ána
b6d-z6ndàna.} ‘ “My brother will seize you and put you in prison,
in jail.” He said “I don’t care about prison.” ’ (A26:43–44)A postposed second person subject pronoun is used with imperatives to
give added force to the command, e.g.
(7)
(8)
(9)qu-plú† ""àti} xzi-mò-d-ila qèßß6t.} ‘Go out and see what is happening.’
(A26:54)
túg6n ""áti gàwe} ‘Sit in it!’ (A20:3)
háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a.} ‘Come Karim, go down into
this conduit.’ (A14:16)the clause871In some cases the pronoun is used to give prominence to the subject
referent for contrastive purposes. This is not a narrow new information
focus on the subject, since the predicate is not presuppositional. Rather
it should be regarded as a form of topical prominence. The construction
is used to give the subject added distinctness where the activity of the
subject is set up in a contrastive opposition to that of another referent.
In (10), for example, there are two characters on the scene, a man and a
woman. The man goes to sleep whereas the woman remains awake. The
construction dmìx5le ""áw} with the postposed pronoun expresses cohesive
temporal sequence to what precedes, but underscores the fact that the
activity was undertaken by him and not her. In (11) the clause with the
postposed pronoun is, likewise, cohesive with what precedes, but the activity of the subject (a lioness) is set up in opposition to the activity of her
young, which is described in the following clause:
(10) kut-dán6t ""á°e xùwwe} m>r6šàtli.} mèra spày.} mára xa-bèna,} dmìx5le ""áw.}
dmìx5le,} wít5la b-lˆle} xúwwe °èle.} ""áy bxèla.} ‘(He said) “When the
snake comes, wake me.” She said “Fine” and he went to sleep.
He went to sleep and during night the snake came. She wept.’
(A24:39–40)
(11) ßlì°5la ""arí°a,} ßráx5la, ßràxa.} ßlí°a šmìy6lla.} klì°5la-""ay.} bnóna díya ßèlye
šètye mìy5la.} ‘The lionness came down, yelling. She came down and
he heard her. She stood and her young went down and drank the
water.’ (A33:10)
It could be argued that the opposition between the two activities in cases
such as (10) and (11) is made distinct by increasing the prominence of
the proposition expressed by the clause as a whole and so the function
of the postposed pronoun is basically the same as in examples (1)–(9). It
is worth noting that in (11) the copula of the compound verbal construction is postposed to the end of the clause, which is a device used to give
prominence to the predicate as a whole (see §15.4.1.4.2.).
When the independent 1pl. subject pronoun is postposed, the intention is often to express a contrastive prominence that gives the pronoun
an exclusive sense. This is typically used in clauses in which the pronoun
refers to the community of the speaker, which is distinct from the community of the hearer. This may be compared to the use of the ‘heavy
coding’ of the long 1pl. pronominal suffix -5ni to express the exclusive
1pl. In (12) and (13) the clauses with postposed 1pl. pronouns are cohesive
with what precedes:872chapter seventeen(12) ""elí°a m6n-""êrb6 xwára,} pà‰a,} ""êrbe,} la-""êzze,} lá ""an-kòme} y-amrèxla ""àxni.}
‘Tail fat is from white small cattle (sheep), a lamb, sheep, not goats,
not black (small cattle), as we call them.’ (B10:5)
(13) y-oðíwa pèške hátxa zòre,} ""o-t b>yéwa q>ràne.} pèške y-oðêxwa ""áxni,} taxàla.} ‘They would make pieces of meat small like this or, if people
wanted, thick. We would make meat pieces for eating.’ (B10:7)
In the constructions considered so far, the nuclear stress is often not placed
on the pronoun, even when the pronoun occurs at the end of an intonation group. If, however, the postposed pronoun is a narrow focus of new
information, it always bears the nuclear stress, e.g.
(14) mèra †la-xa°wà°a,} xá°i ""àna pál†6n.} plí††5la ""ày.} ‘She said to her sisters
“My sister, I shall go out.” She (not any of the others) went out.’
(A12:67)
(15) ""èdyo p7ša ""ày maxóle †la-náše.} ‘Today she (not other people) has begun
to feed people.’ (A21:32)
In many examples in the text corpus the narrow focus is inclusive, expressed
by the particle ""ap, e.g.
(16) t-yálli xa-šúla pálx6n ""àp-ana.} ‘He will give me a job so that also I
can work.’ (A23:3)
(17) xuš-p7š6n képa ""ap-""àna.} ‘Let me also turn into stone.’ (A8:55)
(18) bróni qa†lètli ""ap-àti?} ‘My son, would also you kill me?’ (A28:34)
(19) xon>wá°i mv8do mv9do} t-la-""azítu b-míya ""ap-àxtu.} ‘Brothers, move out
of the way! Move out of the way, so that you also do not go with
the water.’ (A39:12)
Pronouns are postposed in constructions such as the following where they
are conjoined with other items:
(20) t-átw6x šát6x ""ána w-àti.} ‘so that we can sit and drink, you and me.’
(A17:25)
(21) plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra.} ‘You, the ass and the ox have worked.’
(A21:13)
(22) ""u-qíme ""áw ""u-bròn-díye ""u-tre-w>zíre plí†e ßˆda.} ‘He, his son and two
ministers went out hunting.’ (A14:36)the clause87317.7.5. Clauses with a Direct Object Constituent
17.7.5.1. Verb—Direct Object
The default position for the placement of a direct object nominal is after
the verb, e.g.
(1) šáqli lˆša.} ‘They take the dough.’ (B6:46)
(2) m7°6n ""ixàla.} ‘I shall bring food.’ (A26:30)
(3) šaryáwa b>núda dìya.} ‘She would untie her bands.’ (A18:1)
(4) bašlíwa rêzza.} ‘They would cook rice.’ (B7:3)
(5) q6m-p>réla ""ˆne.} ‘He burst his eye.’ (A16:2)
(6) mx5lált6lla ""ay-dùk°a.} ‘She cleaned that place.’ (A17:27)
In most cases the nuclear stress is put on the object, as in the examples
above. When the object is definite in status, the speaker occasionally puts
the nucleus on the verb. The purpose of this is usually to give prominence to the event expressed by the clause for some reason. In (7), for
example, the event is a remarkable act of strength performed by one of
the characters in the narrative. The clause in (8) has importance in the
discourse structure, in that it marks the onset of the climactic section of
the narrative in which the Leli°a monster is destroyed:
(7) na‘êlle ""o-š6ryóxa.} ‘He pulls the tether apart.’ (A28:20)
(8) q6m-""aómàle t8ra.} ‘She closed the door.’ (A19:4)
17.7.5.2. Object—Verb
The object is sometimes placed before the verb. A distinction should be
made between constructions where the fronted object is an information
focus marked by the nuclear stress and those in which it is not an information focus and does not bear the nuclear stress.
The latter type of construction without the nuclear stress on the fronted
object is used to perform two main functions, which may be designated
as ‘event-orientated’ and ‘topic-orientated’ respectively. When it has an
event-orientated function, it expresses an event or situation that has a close
cohesion with what precedes. The object in such cases has some referential link with the preceding discourse, either by explicit previous mention
or by some kind of associative anaphora. In narrative the construction
presents an event as occurring in close spatio-temporal sequence to the
preceding event, e.g.","[908, 909, 910, 911, 912]"
"remarks on the lexicon1031In other cases, by contrast, a dialect word has a meaning that is wider
than that of the Classical Syriac cognate and subsumes it. This has often
arisen as a result of additions or losses in related areas of the lexicon.
The semantic range of the verb xzy in the dialect, for example, includes
both the sense of ‘to see’ and ‘to find’, whereas the cognate in Syriac ˙zy
denotes only ‘to see’. This has arisen, no doubt, due to the loss of the
Syriac verb ""eška˙ ‘to find’ in the dialect. A modern reflex of ""eška˙ can be
identified in the verb form m-‘x III, which is occasionally used by some
speakers, but this is likely to be a loan from the C. Urmi dialect, where
it is regularly used.
The verb dry is used in the C. Barwar dialect as a general word for ‘to
put’, whereas the cognate verb in Syriac has the sense of ‘to sprinkle, scatter’. It appears that the expression of the transference of location that was
a semantic component of the Syriac verb became the dominant feature
and the verb came to be used more generally without being associated
with a specific manner of action. The specific action of ‘scattering’ is now
expressed by other verbs, such as bðq or bzq. The verb sym, the cognate
of which in Syriac is a general verb ‘to put’, has come to be restricted in
the dialect to the sense of ‘to ordain (a priest)’ in stem I and to the fixed
collocation with the object bala with the sense of ‘to pay attention’ in stem
III. The verb m-ty, the irregular stem III for of ""tw, is largely restricted to
the sense of placing a stable object on a horizontal surface.
In some cases the shift in meaning involves an extension of control by the
subject of a verb, i.e. an increase in transitivity. The verb dbq in Syriac,
for example, means ‘to stick to, to adhere’ whereas the dialectal derivative
of this dwq denotes the activity of ‘holding’ or ‘keeping’, which typically
involves greater control over the object referent. This is reflected by the
fact that the dialectal verb dwq ‘to hold, to keep‘ takes a direct object,
whereas the Syriac verb dbq ‘to adhere’ is connected to its complement
by a preposition b- or l-. The verb †'y in Syriac has the sense of ‘to wander, to go astray’, whereas the dialectal reflex †y normally has the more
purposive sense of ‘to search for’, in which the subject has greater control
over the action.
A further type of semantic change is where the basic meaning of the dialectal word does not directly subsume nor is subsumed by the basic Syriac
meaning but rather is associated with some aspect of the contextual usage
of the Syriac cognate. This is a broad category that includes various types
of development, some examples of which are the following.","[1077, 1078]"

17.5. Predications with the Verb HWYIn various contexts, which have been fully described in §15.3.9., the copula
and existential particle are replaced by a form of the verb hwy. Here we
shall restrict ourselves to some remarks concerning the word order of
predications with this verb.
When the verb in the predicate of a main clause expresses a generic or
habitual sense, it is often placed after the other constituents, e.g.
(1) kálba gu-t8r6t màre} l6bbàna y-áwe.} ‘A dog at the door of his owner is
brave.’ (D2:64)
(2) lèxma prìša y-áwe.} ‘Bread is different.’ (B5:99)
(3) ""otáxe gò‰e hawéwa.} ‘Rooms were large.’ (B10:51)
(4) ""áw q6qwána gu-†ùra y-áwe.} ‘The partridge is in the mountains.’
(B5:147)
(5) ""ítl5ni halùke,} ""ap-""áni har-gu-""aqàra y-áwa.} ""ap-""áni rába basìme y-áwa.}
‘We have plums. These are only in the farmland. These are also
very tasty.’ (B5:222)
(6) xlìmta hóya.} ‘It is thick.’ (B6:49)
(7) har-dmáxta dìy6n} biz-zóda gu-b5°wà°a hóya.} ‘Our sleeping is mainly
in the houses.’ (B15:27)
The verb is also placed before the predicate constituents when it has this
generic or habitual sense, e.g.
(8) ""ína ""áyy6t xúmßa har-xúmßa háwe xwarnàya.} ‘But the dish consisting
only of xumßa is whitish.’ (B10:16)
(9) qedámta hál bar-kawù°ra} šèmša y-óya bà°6r †úra,} fa-†êlla háwe} qam-†ùra.}
‘In the morning, until after lunch, the sun is behind the mountain
and there is shade at the front of the mountain.’ (B3:2)
The frequent posposition of the verb hwy to the end of the predicate in
generic/habitual main clauses is no doubt by analogy with the position
of the copula in main clauses. This has come about due to the semantic
proximity between this generic/habitual function of the verb and the
function of the copula.
When used in contexts other than these generic/habitual main clauses,
the verb hwy is regularly placed before the predicate constituents, e.g.","[886, 887]"
"the syntax of verbs775(25) q6m-p>réla ""ˆne.} ‘He burst his eye’ (A16:2)
(26) ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta.} ‘The monk put his leg onto
the leg of the woman.’ (A16:11)
(27) ""u-""áti d6-ráqð6t š5šátla gàn6x.} ‘You should dance and shake yourself.’
(A27:11)
(ii) Objects Lacking Distinctness from the Activity
In some cases the explanation for the lack of agreement with a definite
object nominal is that the nominal does not play a prominent role in the
discourse but rather is presented as an incidental component of the activity. This applies to constructions such as those in (28)–(30) which have the
word b5°a ‘the house’ as the object complement of the verb:
(28) ""ána mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘I have looked after the house (I have done
housekeeping).’ (A21:13)
(29) ""ána mquzqázt6n bˆ°a.} ‘I have arranged the house (I have done
housework).’ (A21:15)
(30) qìmt5la,} mxulálta ""amàne} ""u-kníšta bˆ°a} ""u-mtugbàrta.} ‘She got up and
washed the dishes, swept the house (did house-sweeping) and tidied
it.’ (A21:20)
(iii) Clauses with Reduced Discourse Prominence
The omission of the agreement pronoun is conditioned in some cases by
the reduced prominence of the clause as a whole due to its occurrrence
in a section of the discourse supplying background material rather than
in the prominent foreground. This applies to (31) and (32), which are
extracts from narratives. In (31) the clauses referring to the cutting of
Zàl’s hair without the object agreement are in a section that gives the
preliminary background to the following foreground narrative section, in
which the clause that recounts one specific event of the cutting of his hair
has object agreement. In (32) the clause without object agreement ‘They
did not know God’ supplies general information about the nature of idol
worshippers, which supplies the background for the following foreground
events. The foreground contains a key clause in direct speech with object
agreement ‘I shall kill my son’:

enormous wounds.’ (A29:2–3)

know God. They did not know what the religion of Christians
was. They used to worship idols. (29) His father the king said “I
shall kill my son”. His son fled.’ (B6:28–29)
In some cases of the omission of the object agreeement the clause in
question is of reduced discourse prominence due to the fact that it repeats
information that has been given previously rather than advancing the
discourse, e.g.
(33) qayèmwa báb6t xêtna,} dawèqwala ""íð6 báb6 k yàlo.} ya'ni dwáqa dawèqwa
""íð6-dìye} qá-t ""ó-m6ndi wèle.} ‘The father of the groom would rise

(A14:17)the syntax of verbs777In a stretch of foregrounded discourse the end of the section is sometimes
given greater prominence than the body of the section to mark a clear
boundary. This may be reflected in the distribution of object agreement.
In (37), for example, the execution of two brothers is presented in a
discourse section that may be interpreted as expressing a single overall
event. The princess Parizada gives a command for the execution of each
of the brothers. The command for the second execution, which closes the
section, has the agreement but the first command lacks it:
(37) síq5le xóna ""o-gò‰a,} . . . mèra prúmu rèše!} ""áwwa prìm réše.} qím5le
""o-trè.} qím5le ""o-trè,} sìq5le} . . . mèra prùmle réše díye!} ""áp-aw réše
díye prìma.} ‘The oldest brother came up . . . she said “Cut off his
head!” His head was cut off. The second one got up. The second
one got up and came up . . . she said “Cut off his head!” Also his
head was cut off.’ (A24:31)
(iv) Pragmatic Relation of the Object to the Rest of the Clause
Another factor relevant to object agreement is the pragmatic relation that
the object has to the other components of the clause. Agreement with a
definite direct object is generally omitted on the verb if the object constitutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may be
a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence. In (38), for
example, the clauses marked in bold that have the proper names Zine
and M>mo as direct objects, have the presupposition ‘We shall take X to
Y’, the object slot X, therefore, is a narrow information focus whereas the
verb is in the presupposition:
(38) šuréla mjawóde m-©ðàðe} ""7ni nábl6x k6s-d-ˆni.} Zìne nábl6x k6sM9mo} lo-M9mo nábl6x k6s-Zìne.} mèra là,} bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.}
maq6†làle gáw‰a} nabléxi Zìne k6s-M9mo.} ‘They started arguing
with one another regarding whom to take to whom. “Should we
take Zine to M>mo or M>mo to Zine?” They said “No, a woman
is treacherous. She will have her husband killed. Let us take Zine
to M>mo.” ’ (A26:2)
As we have seen in §15.4.1.4.1. and §15.4.2.6.1., when the verb is a
compound form with a copula clitic, the copula element is often moved
leftwards onto the item in narrow focus. When the clitic is attached by778chapter fifteenthis process to a definite nominal object, there is no pronominal agreement on the verb, e.g.
(39) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: k°àwux-in xèzya gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “What have
you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’
(40) Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} yá'ni xá°6t Mir-Zàndin-ile šqíla Qára Tè≥din.}
‘Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law, that is Qara Te≥din has married
the sister of Mir-Zandin.’ (A26:55)
(41) ""àyy6n ""ána wíða bíya díya.} ‘I did this with her.’ (A21:40)
When a narrow focus is put on some element of the clause other than the
direct object, the agreement pronoun is used with a definite object, e.g.
(42) ""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} mère hè} ""àn6n mú°y6lle †7r6x.} ‘ “Did you bring my
bird?” He said “Yes, I brought your bird.’ ” (A24:32)
(43) ""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Did you kill the snake?’ (A24:45)
If, on the other hand, the object nominal is set up as a topic referent at
the front of the clause rather than as a narrow focus, there is an increased
tendency for object agreement to occur. This can be seen when this
construction occurs in the contexts which have been identified above
as reducing the tendency for the occurrence of object agreement. The
passage in (44), for example, constitutes a preliminary background section to the narrative, which explains why the object agreement has been
omitted in the clauses masqíwa ""6rwèy} (‘They would bring up their sheep’)
and m5°5-""6rwèy} (‘They bring their sheep’). By contrast, in the clause
""6rwéy masqíla l-gár6t ""ùmra} (‘They would take their sheep onto the roof of
the church’), in which the object is placed at the front as a topic, there
is object agreement, despite the fact that this is in the same background
section of the discourse.

they would come alongside that village and become guests of the
village. They would take their sheep onto the roof of the church.","[813, 814, 815, 816, 817]"
"syntactic subordination of clauses995(1) mšaxnánne ""ixàla} ta-t-áxl6x ""ána-w ""áti m-©ðàðe.} ‘I shall heat the food so
that you and I may eat together.’ (A22:31)
(2) d•ry5le xˆla} ta-t-šarê†la gáne.} ‘He struggled in order to release himself.’
(A26:81)
(3) ""áwwa †éni páy6š n†ìra} ta-t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘This saddle bag will
be guarded so that nothing will happen to it.’ (A7:9)
Occasionally the D subordinator is omitted. This is attested mostly where
the preposition has its longer form †la, e.g.
(4) K8rìm zìlle bar-xmáre díye} †la-m5°éwa xmáre dìye.} ‘Karim went after his
donkey, in order to fetch his donkey.’ (A14:17)
In (5), where the purposive particle is placed before a conditional sentence,
the subordinator D, which belongs with the ta-, occurs both before the
whole sentence and also before the main clause:
(5) bnáya gúda ""u-dráya r>ß?ß,} tá-t ""áp-""6n maxíle màdfa'} t-là-tal6xwa gúda.} ‘He
built the wall and put lead into it, so that, even if it was hit by artillery, it would not be destroyed.’ (A11:13)
On some occasions a ta-clause denotes the final outcome or result of a
preceding action, whereby the speaker presents the chain of events from
the viewpoint of this outcome, e.g.
(6) qa-mòt hátxa wáða bíyi,} m5°óye dwáq6lla ""ùrxi} ta-t-lá-mß6n ßál6n be-xàli.}
‘Why have you done this to me, bringing (snow) and blocking my
road, so that I cannot go down to the house of my maternal uncle?’
(A25:42)
(7) ßlàya,} ßálya šátya mìya,} ta-t-qàlba xá-bena xéna.} ‘She went down to
drink water and then finally returned again.’ (A33:8)
19.3.10.2. ‘until’
It is sometimes appropriate to translate †la-/ta- ‘until’, in which case the
realis ""i-qa†6l(wa) form may be used in habitual contexts, e.g.
(1) xall•xwa ""amáne bíye ""u-hênna} ta-t-y-awéwa ßàwma.} ‘We would wash vessels in it and so forth, until it was the fast.’ (B16:8)
(2) ""u-m†ašóy6lla gána hàtxa} tá-t brát6t málka t-ásqa r6š-gàre.} ‘She hid herself
until the daughter of the king went onto the roof.’ (A27:13)996chapter nineteen(3) m•ra d6-klìg6n!} pàl†6n m-gáwe.} m•re là} ta-t-óð6n q8p6x ""àp †la-réš6x,} ba'd∞n
pàl†6t.} ‘She said “Stop! I (want to) get out of it.” He said “No,
not until I make a lid also for your head, then you come out.” ’
(A20:3)
19.3.10.3. Direct Complement
A content clause introduced by †la-/ta- sometimes functions as a factive
object complement of verbs such as ‘to say’, ‘to know’, ‘to inform’. This
is related to its use as an object marker of object nominals (§16.3.4.).
(1) ""•°y6x ta-t-m5ðêxl5xu} ta-t-m-díya ""arpà-sa""6te} g8r6g kúlla náš6t má°a pàl†i
m-gu-má°a.} ‘We have come to let you know that in four hours from
now all the people of the village must leave the village.’ (B1:13)
19.3.11. qa19.3.11.1. Purpose and Result
Clauses introduced by this particle generally are deontic in modality and
express purpose, e.g.
(1) xán‘i t-amr•nna qalùlta} qa-t-pàrqa.} ‘I’ll tell it to you quite quickly so
that it will finish.’ (A4:5)
(2) ßráx5le qa-t-š9ma} brát6t màlka.} ‘He is shouting so that the daughter
of the king hears.’ (A21:16)
(3) b•ny6t-6lla ""ót6x tàma,} qá-t mab•sma kút-yom xà.} ‘You have built her a
room there in order for her to entertain somebody everyday.’ (A4:52)
Occasionally it expresses result without deontic modality, e.g.
(4) ""6n-maxéwa xa-xèna,} ""áp-""aw xón6t Lelì°5wa,} xa°êmwa} qa-t-axêlwale.} ‘If
he had struck again—he was the brother of Leli°a—he would heal
and (as a result) would eat him.’ (A52:25)
(5) qímle b-zdáya m-bróne dìye} qa-t-là-""am6r.} ‘He was afraid of his son and
(as a result) did not tell (= He was afraid to tell his son).’ (A8:17)
In (6) the verb of such a result clause is in the realis ""i-qa†6l form:
(6) xzóli xa-darmána qa-""ˆni,} qa-t-y-ámß6n xáz6n b6‰-našú°a m•ndi hàle.} ‘Find
a remedy for my eyes, so that (as a result) I can see people and the
things around me.’ (A24:2)syntactic subordination of clauses997In (7) it is used as a complement of an expression of ‘keeping vigil’:
(7) šahárta qa-t-qyàmta pál†a.} ‘(They keep) vigil for/until the resurrection
comes out.’ (B5:54)
19.3.11.2. Direct Complement
A content clause introduced by qa- sometimes functions as a factive object
complement. Note that in (1) the copula is placed on the initial pronoun
on account of its focal prominence rather than on the subordinating
particle D:
(1) bár t-ila-ðíta qa-t-""àyy5la °í°a k6sle-dìye,} mux•bla ©ðàðe.} ‘After she realized
that she had come to him, they fell in love with each other.’ (A4:4)
(2) la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do
not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed
has died.’ (A4:33)
(3) dwáqa daw•qwa ""íð6-dìye} qá-t ""ó-m6ndi wèle.} ‘He would shake his hand
(to confirm) that this has taken place.’ (B5:10)
Such a clause may be the complement of an existential particle in constructions such as (4):
(4) lí°wa qá-t mbaqríwa bràta.} ‘It was not the practice to ask the girl.’ (B5:2)
In (5) the main verb takes a 3fs. pronominal suffix, which can be regarded
as a type of anticipatory raising, in that it refers to the propositional content of the embedded clause:
(5) ""áwwa maxzóy6lla qá-t ˙>wáli ""álpa-w ""arbà-mma} šênne} t-íle píša bênya.}
‘This shows that it was built about one thousand four hundred years
ago.’ (B1:7)
Such object complement clauses may also have deontic force, e.g.
(6) múr †la-xòn6x} qa-t ""êdyo} ""áwði tàgbir} ""ásqi l-ßˆda.} ‘Tell your brother that
today they should make a plan to go out hunting.’ (A26:43)
(7) b-xáðexi qá-t mxa°6x°•xxa x6zmayù°a.} ‘We would be very happy to
renew the family relationship.’ (B5:4)
The particle is also used to introduce a clause that is the direct complement of other expressions, e.g.","[1033, 1034, 1035, 1036]"

20.1. Historical Considerations
Many lexical items of Aramaic origin in the C. Barwar dialect have a
meaning that corresponds directly to the meaning of their cognates in
earlier forms of literary Aramaic. Several items, however, have undergone
a semantic development from the meaning that was expressed by their
literary cognates. It must be borne in mind, of course, that the NENA dialects are unlikely to be direct descendants of the classical Aramaic dialects
and so some of the differences in meaning may have already existed in
proto-NENA many centuries ago. It is, nevertheless, of interest to examine
the types of semantic differences from the classical forms of the language
that are exhibited by some of the lexical items in the dialect.
Lexical items in the dialect sometimes exhibit a meaning that is more
specific than that of their cognates in Classical Syriac. In such cases, the
basic meaning of the dialectal word is subsumed by the more general
basic meaning of the Syriac word. This often arises since another lexical
item is used in the dialect with a related meaning.
The word ""arxe (pl. ""arxa°a) in the C. Barwar dialect, for example,
denotes specifically a ‘water-mill’, whereas the cognate in Classical Syriac
ra˙yà (pl. r˙awà∆à) refers to a ‘mill’ in general, including a hand-mill. The
reason for the narrowing of the meaning range of ""arxe in the dialect is
likely to be the existence of another lexical item that denotes specifically
a ‘hand-mill’, viz. garosta n.f. (pl. garosya°a). The semantic range of the
Syriac singular form ra˙yà, moreover, includes also the sense of ‘millstone,’
which is a component of the mill, whereas the dialectal word ""arxe refers
only to the mill as a whole. A ‘millstone’ in the dialect is expressed by
the word p6nxa.
The noun ""6spa n.m. (pl. ""6spe) ‘loan’ is related to the Classical Syriac root
yzp ‘to borrow’. Whereas the Syriac root is used to refer to borrowing in
general, the form ""6spa is used only to denote borrowing in kind, in most
cases consumable items of food, e.g. šqílli x•††e b-""êspa} ‘I borrowed wheat’.
The act of borrowing money must be expressed by a form of the root1030chapter twentydyn, e.g. mudy•nni zúze †la-Gwìrgis} I became indebted in money to Gwirgis
(= I borrowed money from Gwirgis).
The cognate of Syriac sa'rà ‘hair’ (in general) is se‰a, but the dialectal
word is restricted in sense to ‘goat’s hair’. Other words are used to refer
to hair in general, viz. kawsa (collective), m6zze (sing. m6sta).
According to the Syriac dictionaries the nouns 'arbàlà and me˙˙al∆à (variant ma˙˙oltà) both mean ‘sieve’. The reflexes of these words in the dialect
have a more specific meaning, in that they denote sieves with different
sizes of hole, viz. ""6rbala n.f. (pl. ""6rbale) sieve with medium sized holes and
mxilta n.f. (pl. mxilya°a) sieve with small holes (for flour).
The adjective šammìnà in Syriac has a range of meaning including the
senses of ‘physically fat’ and ‘fertile’, e.g. 'ànà šammìnà∆à ‘fat sheep’, ""ar'à
šammìnà ‘fertile land’. In the dialect the word šamina is restricted to the
more abstract sense of ‘fertile’, e.g. "">ra šaminta ‘fertile land’. The narrowing of the semantic range of the adjective in the dialect has arisen due to
the existence of another adjective †risa, which is used to express the sense
of physically fat, e.g. ""6rwe †rise ‘fat sheep’.
The verb xll II ‘to wash’ is more restricted in usage than its Syriac
cognate ˙allel. The dialectal verb xll II is used to express the washing of
individual parts of the body (such as hands, feet etc.) and various objects
but not clothes. The Syriac verb, by contrast, is used to express also the
washing of clothes. In the dialect another verb is used to express specifically the washing of clothes, viz. msy. To wash oneself by covering the
body in water, in a bath or a shower, is expressed in the dialect by the
verb xyp I.
Several verbs in the dialect that are restricted in their usage to activities
relating to animals had a more general application in Syriac. The Syriac
verb ˙sl, for example, was used to express ‘weaning’ both of animals and
of humans, whereas the cognate dialectal form xsl is used only to denote
the weaning of animals. The weaning of humans is expressed by phrases
such as q†"" m6n-m>moße ‘to cut off from sucking’ or q†"" m6n x6lya ‘to cut off
from milk’. The Syriac verb yld ‘to give birth’ was used in relation to all
living creatures, humans and animals, including the laying of eggs. The
dialectal reflex of this yðl, however, is used only in relation to the birth of
animals and the laying of eggs. The birth of humans is expressed by forms
of the verbal bry. The verb dw‰ in the dialect is used to denote specifically
the dwelling of sheep in a rest area during the summer. This appears to
be the reflex of the verb dwr in Syriac and other literary Aramaic dialects,
which has the generic sense of ‘to dwell’.","[1075, 1076, 1077]"
"826chapter seventeen(17) hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye} ""u-hóle míra ""áyya bráti
qa-brònux.} ‘This is the situation: the king has brought his daughter
and said “This daughter of mine is for your son, that is she will
become your wife.” ’ (A21:8)
The enclitic copula, therefore, expresses a general prominence, which is
unmarked with regard to its pragmatic nature. The nucleus of the intonation group, on the other hand, expresses a new information focus. The
two devices usually coincide, in that the enclitic copula is generally placed
on the element that is the new information focus of the clause. They may,
however, operate independently, as in (14)–(17).
On some occasions the subject constituent is placed after the predicate.
In such cases the enclitic copula and the nuclear stress are generally on
the predicate, e.g.
(18) ""àww5le geyása.} ‘The geyasa ceremony is this.’ (B6:4)
(19) ""ànn5la ""eð>wá°6 diy7ni.} ‘Our festivals are these.’ (B6:16)
(20) y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha †úra.} rába rê˙q5le ""o-†úra.} ‘We shall go
up and fetch water from that mountain over there. That mountain
is very far away.’ (A39:9)
(21) mšadóre ""èlla dìya} ""u-náše °èla} q6m-ban7le b7°e dìye,} gu-""èšta šáwwa
yomàne,} ""ašír6t ràb°a-wawa Jazíre Bóta.} ‘She sent them to her and
people came and rebuilt his house, in six or seven days. Jazire Bota
was a large community (consisting of many people).’ (A26:59)
(22) xzéle b-xèlme dìye} ""í° xa-náša gu-d-áy mðìta} biš-f>qíra m-kúlla nàša.}
rába f>qìra-wewa ""awwa-náša.} ‘He saw in his dream that there was
a man in the town who was poorer than anybody else. The man
was very poor.’ (A8:3)
Constructions with postposed subjects such as (18)–(22) are typically used to
express an elaborative comment on something that has been talked about
in the immediately preceding discourse. They are intended to be cohesive
with what precedes more than with what follows. The subject is a topical
referent and not part of the information focus of the clause.
This construction is used also in clauses that repeat information that
has been given in what immediately precedes without advancing the discourse. This is the case in (23), where the postposed subject is placed in
a separate intonation group:the clause827(23) mèra g8r6g m7°6t sisisàmb6r.} sáw6n Tóma smèle, píšle kòra.} sisisàmb6r}
""ˆk5la?} k6s-Lelì°a.} ""áp-xa lá-maße má†e ""èlla dìya.} k6s-Lelì°5la} sisisàmb6r.}
‘They said “You must bring the sisisamb6r plant. Grandfather
Toma has become blind.” “Where is the sisisamb6r?” “With Leli°a.
Nobody can reach it. The sisisamb6r is with Leli°a.” ’ (A50:1)
When the referent of the subject constituent has been mentioned in the
immediately preceding discourse, the copula is occasionally placed on the
postposed subject rather than on the predicate. The copula in such cases
signals the topical prominence of the subject constituent, e.g.
(24) mère k yˆle qáßre díye?} . . . mère "">wà""ha qáßre díyele.} ‘He said “Where is
his residence?” . . . He said “His residence is that (over there).” ’
(A37:10)
The motivation for a construction with a postposed subject such as (24)
is again to signal cohesiveness with what precedes, in this case supplying
the answer to a preceding question. When, conversely, a topical subject
constituent occurs at the front of a clause, this typically expresses a less
cohesive connection with what precedes. As we have seen, the discourse
boundary marking function may be enhanced by increasing the coding
of the subject topic by means of the enclitic copula (14–16).
17.1.1.3. Split Predicate
When the predicate is a composite phrase consisting of several constituents, the copula is sometimes placed on the head of the predicate before
the dependent elements.
This is frequently the case when the head of the predicate is modified
by a dependent prepositional phrase, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""áyya q7†5la †la-˙aywàne.} ‘This is (the activity of ) the summer for
the animals.’ (B5:112)
""Ón-Núne npílt5la l-†úra l-†ùra.} ""“n-Nune lies between one mountain
and another.’ (B5:148)
har-blíg6t b-kàsux.} ‘You are always concerned about your stomach.’
(A23:10)
""an-markáne mtúrßela m-""ùpra.} ‘The jars are made from clay.’
(B5:168)
""aw-zeðáya mtúrß5wa m-xê††e.} ‘The flat-bread was made out of wheat.’
(B5:15)828
(6)chapter seventeen
""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùl-naše.} ‘But it was higher than the
villa of anybody (else).’ (B10:51)If the speaker wishes to give particular focal prominence to the dependent
prepositional phrase, this may be fronted before the head of the predicate
with the nuclear stress and copula placed on it, e.g.
(7)ßáw°a gu-púmm6t màr5la š6klánta.} ‘A word is beautiful (only) in the
mouth of its master (= It is easier said than done).’ (A26:40)The split of the predicate is regularly found when the head of the predicate
is a noun with a subordinate clause as its dependent, e.g.
(8)dán5la qá-t d5r7la m5rˆ°a.} ‘It is time to add the rennet.’ (B5:164)It is occasionally found in nominal annexation constructions, whereby the
copula is placed on the head noun, e.g.
(9) ""ána málk6n d-ày-ba≥6r.} ‘I am the king of that town.’ (A32:9)
(10) ""áwwa xa-nišànq5le} t-""á°‰a d-ˆ-ga.} ‘This was a symbolic act of our
country at that time.’ (B5:153)
In (9) the annexation particle is attached to a dependent phrase that begins
with a demonstrative and in (10) the particle is attached to a dependent
noun that is separated from its head by an intonation group boundary.
In both cases, therefore, the connection between the head and dependent
elements of the annexation are looser than in a construction in which the
annexation particle is suffixed to the head noun (k°aw6t qaša ‘the book of
the priest’). The copula does not split the head and dependent elements
in the latter type of tight annexation, e.g.
(11) ""ap-""ána brón6t màlk5w6n.} ‘I also am the son of a king.’ (A24:45)
(12) ‘ál°6t qáša Hˆdot?} ‘Are you the daughter-in-law of the priest H5do?’
(B9:10)
A copula normally intervenes between a head noun and an adjective only
when the adjective is in a separate intonation group. In such constructions
the adjective can be regarded as a reduced form of a separate predication
(see §14.7., examples 47–50), e.g.","[864, 865, 866, 867]"

dí‰‰e ""o-qamáya q6m-qa†•lle ""o-sàwa.} ‘The first man returned and killed
the old man.’
""u-dí‰5le ß•ly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na.} ‘He went back down to the spring.’
(A26:32)
""áxni †la-mò ßál6x ""áxni mpal†•xle?} ‘Why should we go down and
release him?’ (A26:77)
síqle wírre k6s-bràta.} ‘He went up and entered the girl’s home.’
(A17:24)Examples with imperatives:
(9) sa-dùqla ""ayya-yáwna!} ‘Go and grab that dove!’ (A25:72)
(10) d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
(11) ßli-mur-""êlle} ‘Go down and say to him . . .’ (A26:37)
When the verbs ßly ‘to go down’ or ""sq ‘to go up’ occur in a tight sequence
to a preceding verb, the sequences can often be rendered idiomatically
by English phrasal verbs containing the elements ‘down’ and ‘up’ respectively, e.g.
(12) zadéle ßàle} gu-xa-‘ále gò‰ta.} ‘He threw him down into a big pit.’
(A22:40)
(13) kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-ar•qwa y-ás6q qám d-o-dèwa.} ‘Every day one of
our sheep would run up to that wolf.’ (A10:5)
18.3.3. mßy/ ""mß ‘to be able’
When used in a past perfective form (mßele, m6ßy5le), this verb is often combined asyndetically in a paratactic relation with the verb that is dependent
on it, in that the second verb is put in a past perfective form (q†ille, q6mqa†6l, q†il5le), e.g. mßele °ele ‘He was able to come’. The same applies to
negated clauses, e.g. la mßele °ele ‘He could not come’, la mßele q6m-""aw6dla
‘He could not do it’. The second verb in a negative construction is semantically irrealis, since the action did not take place. In principle, therefore,940chapter eighteenan irrealis form would be expected. The use of the realis perfective form
has apparently arisen by morphological attraction. This, no doubt, is the
background also of the positive construction. The majority of examples
from the text corpus are negated or occur in interrogative clauses:
(1) là-mßeli mu°yáli.} ‘I could not bring her.’ (A8:55)
(2) ""áyya bàxta} lá-mßela mxumˆla ""•rwe.} ‘The woman could not keep the
sheep.’ (A10:6)
(3) la-mßél6n s•ql6n ßˆda.} ‘We could not go up to hunt.’ (A26:46)
(4) lá-mßeli zrìli.} ‘I could not cultivate.’ (A30:13)
(5) l7la-m6ßye wíðe ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They could not do anything.’ (A8:65)
(6) dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a?} ‘How could he have
made this girl a hard-working housewife?’ (A21:32)
(7) ""ánna tre-yále m8nile m•ßya d6ry•lla gu-šaqì°a?} ‘Who could have put these
two children in the stream?’ (A8:15)
When the verb mßy/ ""mß is in the qa†6l form, expressing the present or
future, the complement verb is in the irrealis form, sometimes introduced
by the subordinating particle D, e.g.
(8) máß6x t-àmr6x} ‘We can say’ (B4:3)
In (9) a perfective past verb is followed by another perfective verb but the
latter is introduced by the subordinating particle D:
(9) bráta làn-m6ßya t-in-mú°y6lla.} ‘I could not bring back the girl.’ (A29:8)
18.3.4. ßbr ‘to dare’
A similar paratactic joining is found after perfective forms of ßbr ‘to dare’,
e.g. ßbirre °ele ‘He dared to come’, la ßbirre °ele ‘He did not dare to come’.
The examples attested in the text corpus are negated:
(1) ""áp-xa m•nna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared to speak in the
reception room.’ (A26:70)
(2) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)clause sequences941The irrealis form is also attested after the perfective past, e.g.
(3) ""áp-xa lá-ßbirre ""asêqle.} ‘Nobody dared to go up (and do) it.’ (A33:4)
18.3.5. qbl ‘to permit’
The verb qbl ‘to permit’ may be used in a similar syntactic structure. In
the following example from the text corpus it is negated:
(1) ""áw là-qbille °éli.} ‘He did not permit me to come.’ (A46:3)
18.3.6. šry II ‘to begin’
This verb is normally followed by an infinitive (§15.5.5.). When, however,
it is in a perfective past form, it is sometimes followed by a perfective form
of the verb linked to it paratactically in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
(A25:11)
(2) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
(3) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)
18.3.7. prq ‘to finish’
Similarly, the verb prq ‘to finish’ is sometimes combined together with a
verb in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) bar-príqla kúlla náše šqílla ""arz?q.} ‘After all the people had finished taking provisions . . .’ (B17:12)
18.3.8. pyš majbur ‘to become obliged’
This expression is used to express an obligation and is often prosodically
bonded with the following verb, which expresses the lexical content of
the action, e.g.
(1) páy6š májbur béna xaráya šàte.} ‘In the end it will be forced to drink.’
(A12:47)
(2) píš5le májbur ßêly5le.} ‘He had to dismount.’ (A28:33)942chapter eighteen18.3.9. Cirumstantial Clauses
When a clause is dependent on another clause by virtue of the fact that
it expresses the circumstances of the action of the other clause, this
dependence is often expressed prosodically by combining the two clauses
in the same intonation group, e.g.
(1) kúlla ""•°ye ""itléy š>rá†e t-amríla qa-màlka.} ‘They had all come while having cases to present to the king.’ (A17:31)
(2) hadíya b8ye t-áx6l m•ndi kpìn5le.} ‘Now he wanted to eat something,
since he was hungry.’ (A30:11)
(3) ""u-sulámm6š doqíle lóši xa-jùlla.} ‘They would hold the hive whilst wearing a cloth.’ (B5:178)
18.3.10. Temporal Adverbial Clauses
Similarly, prosodic bonding between main clauses is often used when one
clauses supplies the temporal adverbial setting of the action of the following clause. In such cases the first clauses is idiomatically translated by
supplying a temporal particle such as ‘after’ or ‘when’, e.g.
(1) barzíwa xá‘‘a mkal‘ìwala.} ‘(After) they (the logs) had dried a little, they
would remove their bark.’ (B5:187)
(2) hadíya mkop•šla ßlèla.} ‘Now (after) they had gathered it, they went
down (to the plain).’ (A7:15)
(3) b>láwala yabíšta x6rqá x6rqá gu-qðála díya mabyênwa.} ‘(When) she swallowed a raisin, it could be seen, ring by ring in her neck.’ (A8:63)
(4) m†éle mo°7°6lle xá‘‘a mìya.} ‘(When) he came, she brought some water.’
(A22:28)
(5) hátta Gozáli b-gáne mšudr•tle lˆn °í°a.} ‘Even (when) you sent Gozali
himself, I did not come.’ (A8:94)
18.3.11. Complement of a Clause Constituent
Another context in which clauses occur in a single intonation group due
to their semantic connection is where the second clause functions as a
complement of a constituent in the first clause. In (1), for example, the
second clause should be analysed as the complement of the noun ""urxa
‘way’ (‘the way she learnt’):clause sequences943(1) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""•lla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)
This applies also to clauses that are formally marked as subordinate by
by the particle D. When these are direct complements of a verb, they are
typically in the same intonation group as the verb, e.g.
(2) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
(3) b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
(4) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)
If, however, the subordinate clause is not integrated into the main clause
as the complement of a constituent, but rather is a complement of the
clause as a whole and so is external to it, this looser relationship is sometimes expressed by putting the subordinate clause in a separate intonation
group, e.g.
(5) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you, so that
you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)
18.4. Repetition of Clauses to Mark a Discourse Boundary
Some types of repetition across clauses have been described already in
relation to the connective particles (cf. §18.1.1., §18.1.2.). A further type
of repetitive overlap across clauses is described in this section.
In narrative the narrator sometimes repeats the mention of an event that
has already been narrated before recounting the event that is sequential
to it. The informational status of the clause, therefore, may be compared
to that of a topical referent. The purpose of ‘heavy’ coding of topical
information at the front of a sentence is generally to mark some kind of
boundary in the narrative. This is, indeed, the function of the construction under discussion since it is used to signal the onset of a section. It is
a device used by the narrator to present an activity as a new event with
a degree of independence from what precedes. This is usually a result
of the subjective choice of the speaker as to how the narrative should be
staged. The function of this construction is similar to that of subordinate
‘when’–clauses (§19.3.3.) and, indeed, they are often idiomatically rendered
by supplying ‘when’ in an English translation. Examples:944chapter eighteen(1) kúlla twìre qðaléy,} mì°ela.} mì°ela,} ""áwwa rìq5le,} ß•ly5le m†ùšy6lla gáne.}
‘They all broke their necks and died. (When) they died, he fled, went
down and hid himself.’ (B18:6)
(2) xà-yoma} sìqle} l-ßˆda,} tfìqle} xa-""àrya bíye díye.} tfíqle xa-""àrya bíye díye,}
zílle †ál6b ""àrya.} ‘One day he went out hunting and a lion chanced
to come his way. (When) a lion chanced to come his way, he went
to attack the lion.’ (A27:3)
(3) qímle q6m-†arêdle.} q6m-†ar•dle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him
away. (When) he drove him away, he went back to his aunt’s house.’
(A23:32–33)
(4) zílla q6m-qa†làla} Šóš6t Xère,} q6m-m†amrála gu-""òr6t sus>wá°a ""•lt6x.} q6mm†amrála gu-""ór6t sus>wà°a,} bróna díya °èle.} ‘She went and killed Šoš6t
Xere and buried her in the horses’ manger below. (When) she buried
her in the horses’ manger, her son came back.’ (A38:3–4)
The repeated material is in some cases uttered with a different distribution
of stress either across the words of a stress group (5) or within a single
word (6):
(5) map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.} má†6t l-d-ò-qaßra,} háw6t
h•šy6r ""ína ""áyya sústa là marp•tla.} ‘She will fly you over the seven seas
and you will reach that palace. (When) you arrive at that palace, be
careful not to let that horse go.’ (A12:29)
(6) ""u-m•†y5le qam-d-o-†ùra.} m6†y7le qam-d-o-†ùra,} xirˆle,} mùjb5le.} ‘He
arrived in front of the mountain. He arrived in front of the mountain, he looked and was amazed.’ (A8:53)
In cases where long morphological variants are available, the long form
is used either in the first clause or in the repeated clause. This can be
regarded as two alternative strategies whereby a heavy morphological
form is used as a boundary marker to signal either closure or onset. In
(7) the first clause has a long form of pronominal suffix on the resultative
participle to mark closure (§15.13.5.), whereas the repeated clause has the
shorter, default form. In (8), on the other hand, the long variant of the
imperative is used in the repeated clause:
(7) ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} p°íxt6lle t9ra,} xzí°6lle bába dìya} ""u-""up-w8zīr
mênne.} ‘While there was flour on her hands, she opened the door.
She opened the door and saw her father and also the vizier who was
with him.’ (A21:26)clause sequences
(8)945só l-b7°6t flàn-naša.} sógun l-b7°6t flàn-naša,} ""u-š•qlula ""an-trè-yale,} ""umtàlquley.} ‘Go to the house of such-and-such a man. Go to the
house of such-and-such a man, and take away the two children.
Get rid of them.’ (A8:8)In (9)–(11) the repeated clause has more lexical material than the first
clause. This again can be viewed as a strategy of using linguistic ballast
to mark a boundary, which should be interpreted as the onset of what
follows. In (9) the repeated clause also exhibits the use of the long alternative form of the 3pl. suffix -l5y (cf. §15.12.):
(9)""í°wa xá-n>ra tàma.} kut-táwra m•xy6lle xá gu-réše dìye,} gu-be-""7ne

and put it on the ground. He chopped them all up. He chopped

them they should do. They went off. The police went off at night
and took the two children from their father and mother.’ (A8:9)
18.5. Intonation Patterns
The relationship between clauses is also signalled by the pitch contours
associated with the nuclear stress in an intonation group. By means of
intonation contours the speaker conveys to the hearer a wide range of
signals, some of which belong to levels of expression that have no direct
correlations in linguistic structure, such as numerous personal attitudes.
For this reason it was decided not to mark the intonational pitch contours
in the transcription of the texts. Here we shall restrict ourselves to a
brief examination of some of the main intonational signals, with special
attention to those that mark semantic continuity and discontinuity across946chapter eighteenclauses. The semantic connection between clauses is an issue that has
been discussed in numerous places in the foregoing discussion of syntactic
structure.
We may distinguish two basic types of intonational contours that
are relevant for the present discussion, namely a contour expressing
disjunction and one expressing conjunction. Following the terminology that
is customary in the field of intonation, we may refer to these as ‘major
juncture’ and ‘minor juncture’ respectively.
18.5.1. Major Juncture
The intonation expressing major juncture is characterized by a low fall
in pitch at the end of the intonation group. There is sometimes a slight
rise in pitch on the nucleus. Any syllables occurring after the nucleus have
decreasingly lower levels of pitch. This contour is represented by the symbol . It expresses completeness and disjunction from what follows. As is
the case with many syntactic expressions of disjunction, the decision as to
where such a signal of disjunction should be placed is generally governed
by the choice of the speaker as to how he wishes to present the discourse
to the hearer. Examples:
(1) ""o-gó‰a píšle tàma. } ‘The eldest one remained there.’ (A24:5)
(2) xa-n>ßíy6t t-yánna †làlux. } ‘I’ll give you some advice.’ (A24:9)
(3) lá-""awð6t xá-mdi xéna t-la-b-dìyi. } ‘Do not do anything else without
me.’ (A24:9)
Speakers separate clauses with major juncture to express lack of sequentiality in a variety of contexts.
In (4) the major juncture is used to separate two clauses that are not
connected in temporal sequentiality, but rather are overlapping temporally.
The second clause does not complete the first so much as stand in parallel
with it, giving a supplementary description of the same event. Similarly
in (5) the second clause does not follow temporally or logically from the
first but rather elaborates on it:
(4) ""an-míya p7ši trè-q6sme. } kàli. } ‘The water will become (divided into)
two parts. It will stop.’ (A24:14)
(5) wúðuli xa-‘àra. } xzóli xa-darmána qa-""ˆni. } ‘Cure me. Find a remedy
for my eyes.’ (A24:2)clause sequences947In (6) the disjunctive prosody separates a prohibition from a following instruction, which is supplementary to the prohibition rather than
sequential to it:
(6) là-šoq6t t-kále. } máx6t ""•lle díye ta-t-""ás6q payêdle ""o-†úra. } ‘Do not let
him (the horse) stop. Strike him so that he will go up and cross over
that mountain.’ (A24:11)
When the clauses express temporally sequential events, the purpose of
the major disjuncture is to make a clear division between the two and to
signal that they are not seamlessly connected. This may coincide with a
spatio-temporal shift, as in (7) in which the arrival at the palace is separated
from the event of crossing the water in both place and time:
(7) ""u-p5ðêtla ""an-míya. } má†6t l-qáßr6t Parizàda. } ‘You should cross the
water. Then you will arrive at the palace of Parizada.’ (A24:14)
18.5.2. Minor Juncture
The intonational contour that are typically associated with minor juncture
consists of a rise in pitch on the nucleus. This is typically followed by a mid
fall on the syllables coming after the nucleus. Such a contour is represented
here by the symbol . Minor juncture contour signals incompleteness. It
is regularly used on a clausal constituent that is uttered in an intonation
group that is separate from that of the rest of the clause. This applies to
the clause initial subjects and extraposed items in (1)–(4):
(1) báxta yaqùrta, } ""i-màbra. } ‘A pregnant woman will give birth.’
(A24:13)
(2) ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya mðìta. } ‘The eldest one said
“I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
(3) ""an-š5r°† } láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila. } ‘The conditions—you must know
what they are.’ (A24:10)
(4) sùsux } ""aqlá°e mdurbênnela. } ‘Your horse—his legs have become
wounded.’ (A24:12)
Likewise, if a constituent is placed at the end of the clause in a separate
intonation group, the clause is connected to the postposed constituent by
minor juncture. This applies to (5) and (6), which have a postposed subject
and adverbial respectively:948
(5)
(6)chapter eighteen
""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
t-yáxlux xamšì dináre } kut-yàrxa. } ‘We’ll give you fifty dinars every
month.’ (A24:7)When the speech reported by the verb ‘to say’ is placed following it in a
separate intonation group, the clause with this verb regularly has minor
juncture, e.g.
(7)qím5le m•re qa-bnóne dìye: } bnòni } wúðuli xa-‘àra. } ‘He said to
his sons “My sons, cure me!” ’ (A24:2)Minor juncture is typically used in clauses that occur in non-final position
in a sequence, the final clause in the sequence being marked by a major
juncture intonational contour. The clauses connected in this way may be
temporally sequential, as in (8). The effect is to present the two events as
closely linked together. Minor juncture is commonly used in clauses containing the verb qym (9) or a verb of movement (10–11). As we have seen
in §18.3.1. and §18.3.2., these types of verbs also exhibit a tendency to
be closely bound prosodically with what follows by being combined with
a following verb in the same intonation group.
m•lxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye, } t-áwe súsa mßarßòre. } ‘He will get salt
on his legs and will screech.’ (A24:12)
(9) qímela †¬á°na t-bnóne dìye } ""u-zìlela. } ‘The three sons of his set off
and went on their way.’ (A24:3)
(10) zílela m•†ye gu-ðá mðìta. } ""o-gò‰a } m•re ""ána p7š6n láxxa gu-d-áyya
mðìta. } ‘They travelled and arrived in a certain town. The eldest
one said “I shall remain here in this town.” ’ (A24:4)
(11) ""o-zóra zílle b-""ùrxa. } zílle, zílle, zìlle, } ""•šta šáwwa yomàne, } m†éle
xa-náša sàwa. } ‘The young one went on the road. He went along
for six or seven days and came upon an old man.’ (A24:7)(8)In constructions such as those described in §18.4., in which a boundary is
expressed in the discourse by repeating the content of a clause, the first
clause has major juncture and the repeated clause, which is presented as
the onset of a new section, has minor juncture, e.g.
(12) qímela ""an-tre-xéne zìle. } zílela ""an-trè. } ""ap-o-gawàya } m†éle ða-mðìta.
} ‘The other two went off. The two went off. Also the middle
one came to a town.’ (A24:5–6)clause sequences949(13) t-yánnux xámši dináre kut-yàrxa. } kut-yárxa t-yánnux xámši dinàre, }
""u-plúx m6n-d-ànna paloxáye. } ‘I shall give you fifty dinars each
month. Each month I shall give you fifty dinars, now work with
these labourers.’ (A24:5)
Clauses containing the existential particle that introduce a referent into
the discourse frequently have minor juncture. This is because such clauses
are closely connected with what follows in that they typically create the
expectation that the ensuing clauses will elaborate further on the newly
introduced referent, e.g.
(14) ""í°wa xa-màlka. } ""ì°wale } †¬à bnóne. } ‘There was once a king.
He had three sons.’ (A24:1)
18.5.3. Interrogative Clauses
Interrogative clauses are uttered with a rise from a higher level of pitch
than that of minor juncture (1–3). There is a short fall on syllables after
the nucleus. The contour is represented here by the symbol . Negative interrogative clauses that function as a device for drawing attention
to preliminary background material (§18.2.1.) typically have a lower
level of pitch than the normal interrogative contour (4). To distinguish
these two levels of pitch the symbol of the lower level is qualified by the
numeral 1 whereas the symbol for the regular interrogative contour has
the numeral 2:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)mò t-óð6t? 2} ‘What will you do?’ (A24:4)
k6mà t-yátli? 2} ‘How much will you give me?’ (A24:5)
mòdila? 2} ‘What are they?’ (A24:11)
""ánna l7la dmìxe, 1} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta. } ‘While
they were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’
(A16:11)When a question is rhetorical and does not expect an answer, it may have
a low fall intonation characteristic of major juncture, e.g.
(5)m•re qá-mo là? } ‘He said “Why not?” ’ (A24:7)950chapter eighteen18.5.4. Asseverative Clauses
Clauses that are intended to make a forceful asseveration are uttered
by speakers with a very high level of pitch, higher than the interrogative pitch contour. It includes a rise and fall. This will be represented as
pitch level 3 by the symbol 3. This type of pitch is typically used, for
example, in asseverations containing the negative particle la (cf. §17.2.
and §17.7.14.2. iii):
(1) la-hóle mì°a. 3} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
(2) A: štélux ‘àyux? 2} B: la-štèli! 3} ‘A: “Have you drunk your tea?”
B: “Indeed I have drunk it!” ’CHAPTER NINETEENSYNTACTIC SUBORDINATION OF CLAUSES
19.1. Relative Clauses
Relative clauses may be attributive and modify a head nominal or they
may stand independently of a head nominal and have themselves the
status of a nominal. We shall refer to these types as attributive relative
clauses and nominal relative clauses respectively.
19.1.1. Attributive Relative Clauses
Relative clauses that have attributive function are always placed after the
nominal that they modify. They may be explicitly connected to the head
nominal by the relative particle D, which is either prefixed to the first
word of the clause or is suffixed to the end of the head nominal, e.g. kutyala t-a°e laxxa ~ kut-yal6t ""a°e laxxa ‘Every child that comes here’. When
the particle is prefix to the first word of the clause, the final /a/ vowel
of the head noun is sometimes centralized to /6/ as is the case when the
particle is suffixed to it, e.g. ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli ‘this beautiful
girl, who has fallen asleep with me’ (A26:6). The final /6/ is occasionally
elided, e.g. ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo ‘at the time that the bride came’ (B8:32). A
D particle is sometimes elided, but the final vowel of the head nominal
remains /6/ rather than /a/ as if it were still present, e.g. ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux
gáwa díya ‘the enclosure in which you threw it’ (< ""5-d5rt6t A15:18).
Constructions with the particle D may be termed syndetic relative
clauses. Attributive relative clauses may also be placed after the head
nominal asyndetically, without the particle. The distribution of syndetic
and asyndetic attributive relative clauses is conditioned to a large extent by
the definiteness of the head nominal. A distinction should also be made
between restrictive relative clauses, which limit the reference of the head
noun, and non-restrictive ones, which present supplementary information
concerning a nominal without limiting its reference. This difference in
function sometimes gives rise to distinct syntactic structures.","[977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 987, 988, 989, 990]"
"628chapter fifteen(13) ""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèyw6n.} ‘They put

the Ninevites is not a religious festival. It is a national festival.’
(B6:17)
Occasionally the independent copula with its own stress is placed after
the predicate, e.g.
(16) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
(17) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
(18) ""áw har-xá-mdi ""ìle.} ‘It is something.’ (A14:25)
15.3.1.3. Enclitic Copula Attached to the Subject
When the subject of the clause is high in topicality, the copula in some
instances does not stand independently with its own stress but rather is
cliticized to the subject, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)""áyy5la óìta.} ‘This is butter.’ (B6:41)
""u-""áyy5la kùlla.} ‘This is all (the story).’ (A4:24)
""áw-ile sí‰a bìya.} ‘It is tied to it.’ (B6:55)
xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed!’ (A24:42)These constructions share with the independent copula construction the
feature of having subjects with topical prominence. In the examples cited
above, the referent of the subject has been referred to in the immediately
preceding discourse where it is of central concern. The clauses are, however, unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that they
may express either a contingent or a permanent property of the subject.
They are also unmarked with regard to the communicative salience and
assertiveness of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is shown
by the fact that the construction is used in interrogative clauses containing
interrogative words that are in the subject position, e.g.
(5)
(6)""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’the syntax of verbs629Such constructions, therefore, are close in function to clauses with the
copula cliticized to the predicate, which are likewise unmarked with regard
to the nature of the predicate and the communicative salience of the clause.
They differ only in the marked status of the subject referent, in that this
must be an item that is topically prominent. The placement of the copula
on the interrogative subject as in (5) and (6) can be interpreted as a reflection of the topical prominence of the interrogative word. It is not topically
prominent by virtue of being informationally given, but rather since it is
what the question primarily requests information about.5 Moreover it has
a feature analogous to what has been described above as forward pointing
topicality. This is because the referent of the interrogative constituent is
typically expected to be identified in the subsequent discourse.
The notion of forward pointing topicality also explains the attachment
of the copula in (7) to the adverbial hád6x, which is linked as a correlative
to the following prepositional phrase:
(7) ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma} hád6x-ila š†rànta} max-d-àwwa yóma.} ‘I have a cousin.
She is as beautiful as this sun (lit. She is thus beautiful, like this
sun).’ (A7:17)
15.3.2. The Deictic Copula
As is the case with the independent basic copula, the deictic copula exhibits
certain restrictions with regard to the nature of the predicate and subject
and also with regard to the communicative salience of the proposition
expressed by the clause. It is generally used when the predicate expresses
a contingent situation that is not necessarily a permanent property of the
subject. It may be used without any other clause constituents to draw attention to the location of a referent in the current speech situation, e.g.
(1) mère kˆla tóto?} mère hòla.} ‘He said “Where is grandma?” He said
“There she is (as we speak).” ’ (A7:24)
In many cases it is combined with a locative adverbial in the predicate.
Examples from the text corpus:
(2) yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} ‘Doves are over him.’ (A25:58)5For the topicality of interrogative words see Steedman (2000: 659).","[666, 667, 668]"
"42chapter one
zwana ‘to buy’
gwaya ‘to beg’
qwaya ‘to scoop’mzabone ‘to sell’
mgaboye ‘to elect’
mqaboye ‘to swell’Likewise, the stop of stem II is not elsewhere extended by analogy to
nominal forms as in the case of mzabole: z6bla; cf. mšaboxe ‘to glorify’ vs.
šuxa ‘praise’.
(vi) In some cases the stop /b/ rather than the expected /w/ occurs as
the second radical of a stem I verbal root apparently in order to avoid
homophony between two roots, e.g.
†bele ‘he sank’ (< *†b' )
†wele ‘it roasted’ (< *†wy)
2
gwaya ‘to beg’ (< *gby)
gbaya ‘to froth’ (< *gbb)
A historical *b is sometimes devoiced to /p/ when it has been adjacent
to a laryngal *"", which often, but not always, derives historically from
pharyngal *', e.g.
""arpa
ß6ppa
p-aqle
p-ape< *""arb""à < *""arb'à
< *ß6b""à < *ß6b'à
< *b-""aqlè < *b-'aqlè
< *b-""appè‘four’
‘finger’
‘by foot’
‘beyond’The first two of these examples have alternative forms without devoicing,
viz. ""arba ‘four’ and ßabota ‘finger’. It is possible that the forms with devoicing
have entered the speech of some informants under the influence of the
Christian dialect of Urmi, in which this process of devoicing is regular.
As remarked in §1.3.2., devoicing has sometimes been conditioned by an
adjacent unvoiced consonant, e.g. gupta ‘cheese’ (cf. Syr. g∫ettà < *g∫entà).
1.4.1.2. *p
The reflex of *p is, as a general rule, the stop /p/, including in postvocalic positions, e.g.
kepa
""upra
s6p°a2Cf. Syr.. g∫ì∫à ‘gibbous’.‘stone’
‘soil’
‘lip’< *kèªà
< *'aªrà
< *seª°àconsonants
†6pra
x6pyaya
nap6l‘fingernail’
‘barefoot’
‘he falls’43
< *†eªrà
< *xeªyàyà
< *nàªelA few exceptions to this are found, e.g. †lawxe ‘lentils’ (< *†laª˙è), ruša
‘shoulder, arm’ (< *ruªšà cf. Syr. raªšà ‘shoulder blade’) in which a postvocalic *ª behaves like a post-vocalic *∫. Note also †ußa ‘example’, which
has an original stop *p deriving ultimately from Greek pi (< *†upsà <
Greek τύπος). A further case may be swana ‘projecting edge of a roof ’,
which appears to be cognate with ˇuyoro ßfarno of the same meaning,
both being derived from Syr. sªàrà ‘edge’ (cf. Tezel 2003: 238).
The stop /p/ often appears in Arabic and Kurdish loanwords where
the source language has the fricative /f/, reflecting a process analogous
to that of hardening the fricative *ª in Aramaic words, e.g.
šapra
mtalope
p6rß6t
q6ppo‘large knife’
‘to ruin’
‘opportunity’
‘foam’< Arab. šafra
< Arab. tallafa
< Arab. furßa
< Kurd. kefSome loans exist in two variant forms, one with the original /f/ and one
with /p/, e.g.
feka ~ peka‘fruit’< Arab. fàkiha1.4.1.3. *t
The original interdental fricative allophone of this consonant has been
preserved as an independent phoneme and is represented in the transcription by the symbol /°/. The phonemic contrast between /°/ and /t/ is
demonstrated by minimal pairs such as:
°ela
ma°a
mar°a‘she came’
‘village’
‘mistress’tela
mata
marta‘fox’
‘grape’
‘saying’The fricative /°/ occurs in all positions, after both vowels and consonants,
and also at the beginning of a word, e.g.
""a°‰a
xa°a‘land’
‘sister’44chapter one
xma°a
k°awa
šab°a
qar°a
°ele‘mother-in-law’
‘book’
‘week’
‘cold’
‘he came’When /°/ occurs as a radical consonant in a root, it is used throughout
all inflections of the root, irrespective of the phonetic environment, e.g.
r°x ‘to boil’: ra°6x ‘it boils’, mar°6x ‘he causes to boil’; k°w ‘to write’: ka°wa
‘she writes’, k°awa ‘book’, ka°awa ‘writer’.
In a few isolated cases the articulation of the fricative /°/ is weakened
after a vowel and is elided. This applies to the numeral †¬a ‘three’, which
is a variant of the form †¬a°a. It also sporadically occurs in the inflections
of the verb m-°y ‘to bring’, e.g. may7wa ‘They used to bring’ (< m5°7wa,
B5:157), m5y•nna ‘I shall bring her’ (< m5°•nna A4:9).
On some occasions the stop /t/ is found after vowels in words of native
Aramaic stock. The occurrences may be classified as follows:
(i) Cases where the /t/ was originally geminated, e.g.
brata
‘daughter’
< *brattà
mðita
‘town’
< *mðìttà < *mðìntà
šeta
‘year’
< *šattà < *šantà
(ii) Where the /t/ was originally separated from the preceding vowel by
a pharyngal or a laryngal, which have now been elided, e.g.
qa†ota
‘break in channel’
< *qa†o""ta < *qà†ò'tà
garruta
‘pile of leaves’
< *garru""ta < *garru'tà
beta
‘egg’
< *be""ta < *bè'tà
šmita
‘heard (fs.)’
< *šmi""ta < *šmì'tà
tata
‘crest’ (of bird)
< *ta""ta < *ta8tà
nita
‘(party until) dawn’
< *n8ìhtà
(iii) Where the stop /t/ was originally preceded by the consonant *∫,
which has subsequently become contracted
gota
‘side’
< *ga∫tà
šwota
‘neighbour (f.)’
< *š∫à∫tà
ruta
‘Friday’
< *'aru∫tà
The sequences *a∫ and *à∫ more frequently develop into the diphthong
/aw/ than contract completely to /o/. The stop /t/ occurs after /aw/consonants45diphthongs with this background, in contrast to /aw/ diphthongs containing an original /w/, which are followed by the fricative /°/:
sawta
xlawta
ka°awta
maw°a
ßaw°a‘old woman’
‘milking’
‘writer (f.)’
‘death’
‘voice, sound’< *sà∫tà
< *˙là∫tà
< *ka°°à∫tà
< *maw°à
< *ßaw°à(iv) The fricative /°/ shifts to the stop /t/ when it is in contact with a
following /l/ or /n/. This is abundantly attested in verbs with a final /°/
radical when they have a pronominal suffix beginning with /l/ (L-suffix)
attached to them, e.g.
mitle
‘he died’
< my°
qitle
‘he hit’
< qy°
ditle
‘he sweated’
< dy°
tpitle
‘he sneezed’
< tp°
‘he listened’
< m-ßy° III
mußy6tle
mxu°x6tle
‘he renewed’
< m-x°x°
It takes place when an L-suffix is added to the existential particle ""i° ‘there
is’, e.g. ""itle ‘he has’ (< ""i° + le).
It also occurs when /°/ comes into contact with /l/ within a root,
e.g.
patli‘they turn’< p°lExamples of the shift of the fricative /°/ before /n/ include:
x6tna
""ašitnaya‘groom’
‘man from Ashitha’< *x6°na
< ""Aši°aThis shift of alveolar fricatives before /l/ and /n/ occurs regularly.
(v) Various cases of the stop /t/ after a vowel that cannot easily be
explained by the historical phonology of the word have apparently arisen
by analogy with cases of the stop that can be explained historically.
A few verbal roots contain the stop /t/ throughout all inflections, even
when occurring after vowels, e.g. šty ‘to drink’, ""tw ‘to sit’. The explanation
for the existence of the stop /t/ in these seems to be that at an earlier46chapter onehistorical period the stop allophone was used in some of their inflections
where there was no preceding vowel and that this was then generalized by
analogy to all inflections. In the case of šty, the initial sequence of sibilant
+ stop in certain inflections of the verb, such as the imperative or forms
derived from the past base, is pronounced with ease as a cluster, without
an intervening epenthetic, e.g. šti ‘drink!’, šteli ‘I drank’. This is reflected
by the prosthetic vowel that is indicated in the orthography of some forms
of earlier Aramaic, e.g. Syr. ""eštì. After the distinction between /t/ and /°/
had become phonemicized, the stop would have been generalized to all
inflectional forms, including those where it was preceded by a vowel, e.g.
šate ‘he drinks’. The stop in ""tw ‘to sit’ may have been generalized from
inflections of this verb that have initial /t/, e.g. tiwle ‘he sat down’, tiwa
‘sitting’. Mention should also be made of the noun s6twa ‘winter’, where
the stop /t/ occurs after a vowel. It is likely that here also the explanation
is the initial sequence of s and t. These would have formed a cluster in
the absolute form *staw at some earlier historical period.
The feminine singular resultative participle of the verb hwy ‘to be’ is
wita with the stop /t/, whereas other final /y/ verbs have /°/ in the corresponding form, e.g. xzi°a (xzy ‘to see’). The stop seems to have arisen
by analogy with final /""/ verbs, where the stop is historically explicable
by the original presence of a preceding pharyngal. This is due to the
resemblance between the masculine singular resultative participles:
šm"" ‘to hear’
hwy ‘to be’Resultative participle ms.
šmiya
wiyaResultative participle fs.
šmita
witaIn the inflection of verbs and the existential partial ""i° a stop /t/ resulting
from contact with /l/ is sometimes extended by analogy to inflections
where they are not in direct contact with /l/, e.g.
patli
mitle
""itle‘they turn’
‘he died’
‘he has’pat6l ~ pa°6l
mitwale ~ mi°wale
""itwale ~ ""i°wale‘he turns’ ( p°l )
‘he had died’ (my°)
‘he used to have’1.4.1.4. *d
The original interdental fricative allophone of this consonant has been
preserved as an independent phoneme and is represented in the transcription by the symbol /ð/. The phonemic distinction of /ð/ from /d/
is demonstrated by minimal pairs such as:consonants
guða ‘churn’47guda ‘wall’The consonant /ð/ occurs after both vowels and consonants, and also at
the beginning of a word, e.g.
""iða
huðaya
qðala
mðita
rawðana
ðile‘hand’
‘Jew’
‘neck’
‘town’
‘earthquake’
‘he knew’When /ð/ occurs as a radical in a root, it is used in all inflections of the
root, irrespective of the phonetic environment, e.g. rqð ‘to dance’: raq6ð
‘he dances’, raqði ‘they dance’, r6qða ‘a dance’; šðy ‘to card (wool)’: šaðe ‘he
cards’, šðele ‘he carded’, šaðaya ‘carder’.
A diphthong /aw/ in which the /w/ is the reflex of an original *∫ is
followed either by the stop /d/ or the fricative /ð/, e.g.
kawda
""awða‘liver’
‘she does’< *ka∫dà
< *'à∫≈àThe fricative /ð/ in ""awða occurs since it has been generalized throughout
the root from contexts where it occurs after a vowel, e.g. ""aw6ð ‘he does’.
On some occasions the stop /d/ is found after vowels in words of native
Aramaic stock. The occurrences may be classified as follows:
(i) Words that originally contained geminated /d/, e.g.
< *guddà
guda
‘wall’
šlada
‘corpse’
< *šladdà
b6dra
‘threshing-floor’
< *be + ""6dd6rà
mšad6r
‘he sends’
< *mšadd6r
In some cases the gemination was a secondary development consequent
upon a resyllabification. This explains, for example, the /d/ in the form
xad•ss6r ‘eleven’, which appears to have been secondarily geminated in order
to allow an /a/ vowel to follow the initial letter, presumably by force of
analogy with the form for one, xa: xad•sser < *xadd•""s6r < *˙6≈a'sar.","[80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86]"

"the syntax of verbs701(i) ‘to become’
When used with an ascriptive or identificatory predicate, it has an ingressive sense of ‘becoming’, expressing a present resultative state, e.g.
(1) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} záwna wíy5le t-šlàma.} ‘You
have not become a good man and brought these coins. The time
has become one of peace.’ (A1:26)
(2) bálki qam-dána háwa wíye xèzme m-©ðàðe.} ‘Perhaps beforehand they
have become relatives of one another.’ (B5:5)
(3) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
word) †alana means ‘shady’, since when the sun would strike the
mountains, they became like that.’ (B3:2)
Note that in (3) the resultative form is used in an apodosis of a temporal
sentence that contains a habitual verb in the first clause (maxyàwa). The
resultative must have a distributive sense, i.e. on each occasion when
the sun struck the mountains, they became like that. Furthermore, since
the resultative expresses a state, it cannot be interpreted as a sequential
event but rather as an temporally overlapping situation (literally: ‘At the
time when the sun struck the mountains, they have become like that’).
(ii) Existential Function
The form may be used to express the coming into existence of the subject.
When the subject is inanimate, the verb has the sense of ‘happening’,
e.g.
(1) ""áp-""ayya p-aqènna ""êllux,} sab-wít5la b-réši ""up-àyya.} ‘I shall tell you also
about this, since this also happened to me.’ (B15:85)
(2) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
(B5:163)
(3) hadíya mtán6x xa-qêßß6t} t-íla wíta gu-ˇiyàre} qám-plaša qamàya.} ‘Now
we’ll tell a story that happened in ˇiyare before the First World
War.’ (B17:1)
(4) ""ˆ-ga} ""ánna m6ndiyáne wìyela.} ‘Those things happened at that time.’
(A19:9)
In (1) and (2) the events in question took place at a time that is remote
from the present, but they are presented from the perspective of the
speaker at the present moment. They can be interpreted as ‘experiential
perfects’, i.e. events that are part of the speaker’s life experience or at702chapter fifteenleast events that he has heard about in his life. Examples (3) and (4) are
narrative uses of the resultative construction that are equivalent in function to the q†ille form (§15.4.1.3.).
When the subject of the verb is animate, it has the sense of ‘to be
born’, e.g.
(5) šet6-†è¬¬6° wìt5la} S6ttìye.} ‘In the third year S6ttiye was born.’ (A25:25)
(6) ""ím6 t-íla wíta S6ttìye,} ""áy biš-xám°5la m-kùlla.} ‘When S6ttiye was born,
she was the most beautiful of all.’ (A25:26)
(7) b-ay-dána lànwa wí°a.} ‘At that time I was not born.’ (B10:45)
(iii) Temporal Expressions
In narratives, the construction sometimes takes a nominal denoting a period
of time as its subject in clauses that set the temporal frame for what follows. The subject nominals are placed after the verbal form, e.g.
(1) wíy5le yóm6t †¬à°a} ""áwwa f†ìr5le} ""u-plì†5le.} ‘(When) the third day came,
he had breakfast and went out.’ (A22:24)
(2) wít5la qèdamta,} jènne ""ê°yela,} šqìl6lla Zíne} nùbl6lla Jazíra Bóta.} ‘In the
morning, the jinn came and took Zine, took her away to Jazira
Bota.’ (A26:8)
(3) wít5la qedámta sá""6t ""árpa b-lˆle,} ‰ìš5le} màlka.} ‘(When) the morning
came, four o’clock in the morning, the king woke up.’ (A17:27)
(4) wít5la dán6t mabròye,} tèrw6°na mubrèla} hàr ""o-yóma.} ‘(When) the time of
giving birth came, they both gave birth on the same day.’ (A25:4)
(5) wít5la dàna,} mìßela ""èrbe,} pá‰e m6n-y6mma°èy,} mère . . . } ‘(When) the season
came and the sheep sucked, the lambs sucked from their mothers,
he said . . .’ (A25:26)
As has been discussed in §15.4.1.3., the resultative form can be used in
narrative with the function of a preterite rather than a present perfect.
Judging by cases such as (4) above, however, where the following clause
is in the q†ille form, it would appear that the resultative forms wiy5le and
wit5la here have their basic function of expressing a resultant state rather
than an event, i.e. the state against the background of which the event
described in what follows took place. In (1)–(5) the verbs can be interpreted
as existential forms of hwy, correponding to the previous category (‘the
third day happened’). The gender agreement between the initial verbthe syntax of verbs703form and the following temporal noun demonstrates that the noun is the
grammatical subject.
Various examples are attested that exhibit a development of the aforementioned construction, whereby the resultative of the verb hwy is used
before an adverbial prepositional phrase or an adverbial clause, which
cannot function as the grammatical subject. In such cases the verb has
a 3fs. form, which must be an impersonal subject, with the adverbial
functioning as the predicate, e.g.
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)wít5la b-lˆle} maláxa m5‰èšle qa-ràbb6n.} ‘In the night the angel woke
the monk.’ (A15:11)
wít5la b-lˆle} xúwwe °èle.} ‘In the night the snake came.’ (A24:40)
xa-béna wít5la hád6x b-lˆle} mèxy5le taq-taq-táq l-t9ra.} ‘Then, at night,
there was a knock at the door.’ (A23:26)
wít5la bar-""o-náša sáwa ßèly5le mt>mòz6lla ë6nn6k7ra díya,} ""áp-""aw ßèly5le
mhayóre ta-d-o-sàwa.} ‘After that old man went down to clean around
it, he also went down to help the old man.’ (A14:77)In (10) the two constructions are combined, in that it contains both a
prepositional phrase and a nominal without a preposition:
(10) wít5la b-lˆle,} dána t-dmàxa,} xílela mêndi.} wít5la dána t-dmàxa,} x6mmêr°a,}
x6mmèr°6 šên°a} šqìlt6lla,} mutt7°6lla r6š-ßádr6t xmá°a dìya.} ‘At night,
the time of sleep, they ate something. At the time of sleep, she
(Leli°a) took a bead, a bead of sleep, and put it on the chest of
her mother-in-law’. (A19:3)
In the discourse structure of narratives, constructions with initial adverbials discussed in this section are disjunctive in function and mark the onset
of new episode.
(iv) Combined with the Existential Particle
When the verb has an existential function, the copula is sometimes replaced
by the existential particle (""i°, li°), e.g.
(1)
(2)lí° wíya ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Nothing has happened.’ (A29:22)
lì° hátxa mèndi wíya gu-mðíta.} ‘Nothing like that has happened in
the town.’ (A22:2)704chapter fifteenSuch constructions may refer to a situation that arises through a series
of recurrent events, e.g.
(3) ""í°wa rába xlulàne} wíye gu-mà°a.} ‘Many weddings took place in the
village.’ (B15:73)
15.4.2. The Infinitive Combined with the Verb ‘to be’
15.4.2.1. General Remarks
The infinitive may be combined with the various copulas and inflections
of the verb hwy to form a compound verbal form.
This construction originated historically as a locative predication, with
the locative preposition b- ‘in’ attached to the infinitive. In some NENA
dialects this preposition is still regularly used with the infinitive in the
construction, e.g. C. Urmi b-grašel6 ‘he is pulling’, but in C. Barwar the
preposition is normally elided and is only heard sporadically. Examples
attested in the text corpus include:
(1) hóle b-°áya ""axêll5xu.} ‘He is coming to eat you.’ (A13:14)
(2) †ˆre} hóla b-°áya l-qàle.} ‘The birds are coming at (the sound of ) his
voice.’ (A25:43)
(3) ""u-†árp6t d5rúb6r hóla b-n°àra.} ‘The leaves of the wood are falling.’
(A25:46)
(4) b-xyára b-zeðàye.} ‘He looks at the pitta breads.’ (A30:11)
(5) b-txár6n ‘I remember’ (B15:84)
The b- is regularly used only in the fixed phrase b-xšaw5n ‘I think’.
15.4.2.2. Progressive Function
The infinitive may be combined with the deictic copula, the basic copula
or the negative copula. When the basic copula is used, this is in its enclitic
form. As has been shown in §15.3.1–§15.3.2., the enclitic basic copula
and the deictic copula are used with predicates expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent basic copula is used
only with predicates expressing permanent properties that, typically, are
intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have not been acquired.
As will be shown below, the infinitive compound construction expresses
a transient activity that is not a permanent property of the subject and
so it is in principle not appropriate to use the independent copula in the
construction.","[739, 740, 741, 742, 743]"
"558chapter fourteen(11) kùll6n,} m6n-yále zóre ""u-hal-gò‰e} ‘all of us, from young children all
the way to old people’ (B16:4)
(12) m-ó-yoma dwíq6lle M8mo gu-hàbsa,} ""u-hàl-""6dyo.} ‘From that day he has
held M>mo in prison, all the way until today.’ (A26:75)
Lists of items, which are presented individually rather than linked together
in a composite whole, are in some cases expressed without any connective
particles, e.g.
(13) gêrwe,} ßàwle,} júlle rìxe,} júll6 j6rj∞t} ‘stockings, shoes, long clothes,
clothes of purple fabric’ (B10:30)
(14) y-awéwa wásta bra-qðàla,} br5°á°e rìxe} y-oðêxwala.} ‘There was the chest
(of the blouse), the collar, long sleeves, which we would make.’
(B10:45)
(15) ""u-kúl-m6ndi y-áwe pêrya,} xàlta,} štˆ°a,} m-kùl-m6ndi.} ‘Everything was
in abundance, food, drink, (something) of everything.’ (B15:63)
A noun may be repeated to make the class denoted by it more general.
In most cases the second occurrence of the noun is introduced by the
particle ma-. The connective particle w may optionally occur before the
ma- particle (X ma-X ~ X ""u-ma-X), e.g.
(16) jawètta †la-pràma} ""anna q7se ma-qˆse.} ‘A chopper was for chopping
wood and the like.’ (B5:141)
(17) ""áxxa xuwwáwe ma-xuwwáwe lˆ-y-a°5 l-d-áwwa gèšra.} ‘Here snakes
and the like will not come onto this bridge.’ (A30:49)
(18) kúl-m6ndi d5r7wa bìya.} harmòne} ""u-ma-harmòne,} h5rmìye,} sparêgle.} ‘They

you should not say (that he) is a fiancé or something.’ (A25:22)
On some occasions, instead of prefixing the ma- particle, the first consonant
of the second occurrence of the noun is replaced by a different consonant,
resulting in a word that has no meaning in isolation, e.g.
(20) ""ána háw6n Qára Tèždin,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye.} ‘I am Qara
Teždin, the collector of taxes and the like of the people of Botan.’
(A26:34)the syntax of nominals559A related strategy is to repeat the word with a change of internal vocalic
pattern, e.g.
(21) bráte díye muttúla qáßre ""u-qaßòre.} ‘His daughter established villas and
palaces.’ (A40:7)
We may include here the combination of stem I and stem II resultative
participles in order to express intensity in contexts such as (22) and (23):
(22) b6d-p7š6t b-šòpi,} bríxta mburàxta.} ‘You will stand in my place, (you
are) greatly blessed. (A40:15)
(23) pàq6ð bába ""azíza,} xqìra,} gu-d-áyya dúnye mxùqra.} ‘Welcome dear,
esteemed father, honoured in this world.’ (A40:12)
In (24) the second resultative participle is from a cognate quadriliteral
verb:
(24) qóipew6x mqor6ópew6x.} ‘We are cut down and harvested.’ (A51:8)
Another practice is to place the generic word m6ndi ‘thing’ in apposition
to the noun, e.g.
(25) kút-ile xíl6lle xa-ràmši-m6ndi} gu-bˆ°i} ""á°e xarèla gu-b7°i.} ‘Everyone
who has eaten my dinner or the like (i.e. any food) in my house,
let him come and defecate in my house.’ (A7:5)
14.12. Numerals
Cardinal numerals are placed before the counted nominal, which follows
in apposition. The nominal is in the plural after all numerals above ‘one’,
unless it is a loanword that has not been adapted to Aramaic morphology and does not take plural inflection. The only exception to this is the
word ""6mma ‘hundred’, which remains singular when preceded by numerals, e.g. tré ""èmma ‘two-hundred’, †¬á°a ""èmma ‘three-hundred’, ""árba ""èmma
‘four-hundred’. The word ""alpa ‘thousand’, by contrast, is made plural after
numerals, e.g. tré ""álpe ‘two-thousand’, †¬a°a ""alpe ‘three-thousand’, ""árba ""álpe
‘four-thousand’. The word ""6mma is plural in expressions such as ""6mmày6t
šènne} ‘hundreds of years’ (B15:92).","[596, 597, 598]"
"the clause833(1) hóla làxxa.} ‘They are here.’ (A14:100)
(2) hóle gu-Kàrkuk.} ‘He is in Kirkuk.’ (A16:1)
(3) hóla gwìrta.} ‘She is married.’ (A26:31)
On sporadic occasions deviations from this structure are found. In (4)–(6),
for example, it is placed after the predicate. In (7) it is used in combination with an enclitic copula:
(4) bas-†lìya hóle.} ‘But he is asleep.’ (A31:6)
(5) ""árye dìye} k6s-báxte dìye hóla.} ‘His lions are with his wife.’ (A18:19)
(6) šxàna hóli!} ‘I am getting hot!’ (A32:23)
(7) hóle qúrb6t nùr5le.} ‘He is near the fire.’ (A23:9)
17.1.3.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent, the deictic copula is normally placed before the predicate. There is variation, however, regarding
the position of the subject, in that it may be placed before or after the
copula.
(i) Subject—Copula
When the subject is placed before the copula, the clause in principle
marks some kind of discourse boundary. This construction often occurs
at the beginning of a section of text that concerns the referent of the
subject, e.g.
(1) xa-bráta hóla tàma} ""ána mèri ""êllux,} bráta zamàrt5la.} ""áp-xa l5lemßáya bíya dìya.} ‘A girl is there. The girl is a singer—as I said to
you. Nobody can prevail over her.’ (A25:68)
(2) baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.} ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti
mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla
bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘Our wives are both pregnant. If your wife
gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth to boy, your daughter
(will be married) to my son. If my wife gives birth to a daughter
and your wife gives birth to a son, my daughter (will be married)
to your son.’ (A25:2–3)
(3) ""Ón-Nùne} hóla npílta gu-""á°‰6t Bêrw6r.} ""“n-Nune lies in the land of
Barwar.’ (B4:1)
The construction is sometimes used to introduce a discourse section that
is inserted within a larger section. This applies, for example, to (4), which834chapter seventeenis an extract from a description of the activities of the bride in a wedding. The construction in question with the deictic copula marks a shift
to a section concerned with the activities of the groom. The discourse
subsequent shifts attention back to the bride:
(4) y-amríla zawèrt6t k yàlo.} ""ày} ta-t-toràla} k yálo xaráye t-óra gu-bˆ°a.} maxyàle
""o-mèšxa.} xètna hóle zína l-gàre.} m6n-gáre maxé-""aqle r6š-swána
hàtxa,} ßále xán‘i ""úpra gu-réš6t k yàlo.} xaráye t-àwra.} ‘They call it “the
bride’s pot.” It was for the bride to break in order that she could
finally enter the house. She would apply the oil, while the groom
was standing on the roof. From the roof he strikes his foot on the
eves like this and a little earth falls onto the head of the bride.
Finally she enters.’ (B8:33–34)
The inserted section may consist of only a clause, as in (5), in which the
speaker uses the construction to turn attention to the activity of the doves.
The effect is to present this as an activity with a degree of independence
from the activity of the youth described in what precedes, which is concomitant with it rather than being a component of it:
(5) xa-yála rába šapìra} hóle ""ê°ya,} súse mrúpy6lle gu-màrgax.} hóle dèry6lla gáne
gu-bèrke dìyax.} hóle sxàya,} yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} mút ""áti tíwta
làxxa?} qu-xzà!} ‘A very handsome youth has come and released his
horse in your meadow. He has immersed himself in your pool and
is swimming. Doves are (flying) over him. Why are you sitting here?
Get up and see!’ (A25:58)
The initial subject constituent is occasionally placed in a separate intonation group. This is the case in (6), in which the two clauses with the
deictic pronouns distinguish between the situation of his aunt and uncle
by presenting them in a contrastive opposition. The prosodic separation
of the subject topic constituent enhances the distinctness of the two poles
of the opposition:
(6) qìm5le,} šèmm6t má°a díye wéwa Barwòre.} ""ámte dìye} hóla gu-Sàrzar} ""u-xále
dìye} hóle gu-Daštàne.} ‘The name of his village was Barwore. His aunt
was in Sarzar and his uncle was in Daštane.’ (A23:1)
(ii) Copula—Subject
When the subject constituent is placed after the copula, the clause is
presented with a greater cohesion with what precedes. In (1) and (2) thethe clause835construction gives descriptive detail concerning the preceding event. In
(3) it describes a situation that is an immediate consequence of the preceding event. In (4) the clause introduces the instrument of the following
activity of the cutting of the bread and in this sense is cohesive with what
follows. The placement of the subject after the copula, however, has the
effect of binding the whole section describing the cutting of the bread to
what precedes and presenting it as a direct consequence of it.
(1) wír5le gu-xà-""ot6x xéta} gò‰ta} hóla xákma kurs>wà°a} m-ày-gota}
xákma m-ày-gota.} ‘He went into another room, a large one.
Some chairs are on one side and some on the other.’ (A14:29)
(2) ""áy hóla wáða kùbbe.} hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe.} ‘She is making
meat-balls. Her hands are in dough, while kneading the meat-balls.’
(A21:26)
(3) mú°y6lla làxxa} ""áw-u w9zìr} ""u-hóla wajjúwe díya làxxa.} ‘He and
his vizier brought her here, and her effects are here.’ (A21:9)
(4) zeðàye} t-la-qßàya} de-mà†o hóya?} hóla skínta mênne.} xarè†la zeðàye}
b-pálga dìya.} ‘(He says) “Pitta bread without breaking it, how could
that be?” He has a knife with him. He scores the pittas in their
middle.’ (A30:21)
17.1.4. Copula Clauses with an Interrogative Constituent
The predicate of a copula clause may be an interrogative constituent, e.g.
mòdile?} ‘What is it?’ (A4:48), ""ˆnile?} ‘Who is it’ (A22:32), ""ˆk5le?} ‘Where
is he?’ (A4:19).
When the clause contains a subject constituent, the copula is always
placed on the predicate. The subject is placed either before or after the
predicate. The basic principle determining the position of the subject is
the same as in indicative clauses. The placement of the subject in initial
position before the predicate typically marks some kind of boundary in
the discourse, whereas the subject is postposed after the predicate when
the speaker wishes to present that clause as having greater cohesion with
what precedes.
The construction with the subject before the predicate is frequently
attested in the text corpus at the beginning of a section of discourse that
supplies an explanatory comment on what precedes, e.g.
(1) hóle ""í°6n làxxa} stêrra.} stèrra mòdile?} xê††ele} ""u-šìšmele} ""u-pràge} ""u-sà‰e,}
kúlla dèrye gu-mzìðe.} ‘There was a food store. What is a food store?","[871, 872, 873, 874]"

1.4. Historical Background of the Consonants1.4.1. The BGDKPT Consonants
1.4.1.1. *b
The reflex of the fricative allophone of *b in earlier Aramaic is the semivowel /w/. This is found after both vowels and consonants, e.g.
genawa
sawa
ßliwa
""6rwa
šwawa
dawa
g yaw‰a
zawna
xawra
šawqa‘thief ’
‘grandfather’
‘cross’
‘sheep’
‘neighbour’
‘gold’
‘man’
‘time’
‘friend’
‘she leaves’< *gannà∫à
< *sà∫à
< *ßlì∫à
< *'er∫à
< *š∫à∫à
< *dah∫à
< *ga∫rà
< *za∫nà
< *˙a∫rà
< *šà∫qàWhen *∫ was preceded by *u, the sequence *u∫ contracted to /u/, e.g.
gure
tuna
duša
ruta‘men’
‘straw’
‘honey’
‘Friday’< *gu∫rè
< *tu∫nà
< *du∫šà
< *'aru∫tàOn some occasions the sequence /aw/ that derives from *a∫ or *à∫ contracts to /o/ before a consonant, e.g.
gota‘side’< *ga∫tàIn a number of words of native Aramaic stock, the stop /b/ occurs after
a vowel. These may be classified as follows:
(i) Cases where the /b/ was originally geminated, e.g.
xabuša
‘apple’
< *˙abbùšà
dabaša
‘bee’
< *dabbàšà
šab°a
‘week’
< *šabb6∆à
mzab6n
‘he sells’
< *mzabbenconsonants41In the word ßabota ‘finger’ the stop /b/ may have arisen by secondary gemination of an original *b in order to prevent the elision of the preceding
vowel after the insertion of an epenthetic vowel after it: ßabota < *ßabb6""tà
< *ßab'6∆à. Compare J. Amedia ßabo""ta, Qaraqosh ßub6""°a. The gemination
has been preserved in some dialects, e.g. D5re ß6bbota.
(ii) When the preceding vowel is an epenthetic, e.g.
kal6b°a
‘bitch’
cf. kalba ‘dog’
(iii) Where a word beginning with /b/ has been bonded with a preceding
element that ends in vowel, e.g.
xo-b5°a
‘under the house’
gu-b5°a
‘in the house’
We can include here verbal roots that have /b/ as their first radical. The
stop remains through all inflections, including when prefixes that end in
a vowel are attached to it, e.g. brq ‘to shine’, bar6q ‘it shines’, mabr6q ‘it
causes to shine’; bny ‘to build’, bane ‘he builds’, mabne ‘he causes to build’.
This invariability is also exhibited by most noun forms, e.g. kalba ‘dog’,
kal6b°a ‘bitch’. The plural form of this word constitutes an exception to
this principle: kalba ‘dog’ vs. kalwe (< *kal∫è) ‘dogs’.
(iv) Where the /b/ was originally preceded by a vowelless consonant,
which has now been elided, e.g.
sebu°a
‘old age’
< *sa""bu°a
mšaboðe
‘to enslave’
< *mša'boðe
(v) Forms arising by analogy with words that have preserved /b/ for one
of the reasons listed above. Examples of this include dab6š ‘it sticks’, which
is a stem I verb and so the middle radical would not have been geminated
historically, and z6bla ‘manure’ (cf. Syr. ze∫là). In both cases the source of
the analogy appears to have been stem II verb forms (historical pa''el), in
which the middle /b/ was originally geminated, viz. mdab6š ‘he makes stick’
(originally ‘he makes like honey’) and mzab6l ‘he lays manure’. Elsewhere a
stop /b/ occurring as the middle radical of a stem II verb is not extended
by analogy to stem I forms that belong historically to the same root. This
is found mainly where there is considerable semantic distinction between
the two stem forms, e.g.","[78, 79, 80]"
"748chapter fifteen(6) b-7-šeta píšla Dúre muqyàmta-w} ‘In that year Dure was evacuated.’
(B1:8)
(ii) The verb pyš with an ingressive function can be combined with an
infinitive and have the sense of beginning the action in question, e.g.
(1) ""u-táwra píšle mangóle ""áxxa l-tàmma.} ‘The ox began to limp back and
forth.’ (A22:3)
(2) píšt5la mtanóye ða-qêßß6t} †la-qà†u.} ‘She started telling a story to the
cat’. (A14:2)
(3) píšela mnáy6lla l-xà-xa.} ‘They began to count them, one by one.’
(A6:3)
(4) ""áyya m6škènta píšt5la mxàya} dráya qè†ma gu-réša dìya.} ‘The poor woman
began to beat (herself ) and put ash on her head.’ (A14:22)
(iii) Ingressive pyš is occasionally combined with a perfective verbal form
to convey the sense that the event in question is the final outcome of a
chain of events. This is the case in (1), where it is combined with a perfective future qa†6l form:
(1) bas-tàma} qèßß6t dìy6x} ""u-t-xòn6x} p7ša mà†ya} l-xarayú°a dìya.} ‘There your
story and that of your brother will (finally) reach its end.’ (A8:88)
A similar function is sometimes performed by a construction in which pyš is
combined with the resultative participle of a telic intransitive verb, e.g.
(2) tíwela tàma} ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They sat there, ate food, then
(in the end) went to sleep.’ (A15:8)
(iv) Ingressive pyš is sometimes used in narrative before expressions of
time to mark the beginning of a new episodic section. It may be used to
denote the onset of a point in time, e.g.
(1) píšle yòma} hár wewa-xðàra.} ‘Day came and he was still searching
about.’ (A14:24)
(2) píšt5la ""aßêrta.} gu-sá""6t ""èšta ""aßèrta šáwwa gu-gn7°6t yòma,} hóle °éle ’ùxo,}
xa-bèrra ""èrwe bà°re.} ‘The evening came. At six or seven o’clock in
the evening, at dusk, ’uxo came, with a flock of sheep following
him.’ (A7:21)
(3) píšta mbàdla.} mbádla qìm5le.} ‘Morning came. In the morning he got
up.’ (A14:66)the syntax of verbs749In (1)–(3) above the expression of time can be construed as the grammatical
subject of the verb. The expression of time may also be a prepositional
phrase, as in (4). Here the grammatical subject of the verb, which is 3fs.,
must be impersonal:
(4) píšla b-lˆle,} sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘At night he went up onto the roof.’
(A25:52)
The verb pyš may also be used to denote the passage of an interval of time.
In such contexts it has 3ms or 3fs inflection. The time expression appears
not to be construed as the grammatical subject, judging by constructions
such as (7), in which a 3ms. verb is followed by a feminine nominal phrase,
and (8), where a 3fs. verb is followed by a masculine nominal phrase:
(5) píš5le xà-yarxa} málka xzéle xa-xèlma xèna.} ‘A month later the king had
another dream.’ (A1:9)
(6) píšle šènne rábe ""árbe xámm6š ""èšš6t šènne la-zìlle.} ‘For many years, four,
five six years, he did not go there.’ (A18:12)
(7) píš5le ða-šáb°a xˆta,} ""ám6r †la-báxta . . . ‘A week later, he said to his
wife . . .’ (A5:8)
(8) p5šáwa xa-yóma trè,} hál barêzwa.} ‘One or two days would go by until
it became dry.’ (B5:167)
15.9. The Expression of the Passive
Various constructions are used to express the passive of a transitive
verb.
15.9.1. q†il
The dialect exhibits a vestigial use of the past base stem q†il to express a
passive action. This is only used sporadically and is restricted to the 3rd
person. As is the case with the q†ille form, the q†il form expresses a specific
event occurring in the past at a particular point in time, e.g.
(1) mèra prúmu rèše!} ""áwwa prìm réše.} ‘She said “Cut off his head!” He—his
head was cut off.’ (A24:31)
(2) bá°6r t-gníw Mar-Qayòma,} q6m-dawríle t9ra.} ‘After (the church of ) St.
Qayoma was plundered, they closed the door.’ (D2:66)750chapter fifteen(3) mó°i júlla dìya.} ‘Her clothes were brought.’ (A4:20)
(4) brátux mù°ya.} ‘Your daughter has been brought back.’ (A29:42)
(5) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre.} ‘That was the last girl who
was buried in Dure.’ (B1:12)
(6) ""ína ""an-tre-xéne píšela hál-dan6t t-íxwa ""áxni tàma,} hál-šèt ""álpa ""6óóá-mmaw šáwwi tmànya,} ""íman t-moqìma Dúre.} ‘But the other two remained
until the time that we were there, until the year 1978, when Dure
was evacuated.’ (B1:5)
There are other signs of the fossilization of this construction in addition
to the extreme infrequency of its use. The 3ms. form q†il can be used also
with 3fs. and 3pl. nominal subjects:
gaw‰a q†il
baxta q†ila ~ q†il
naše q†ili ~ q†il‘The man was killed’
‘The woman was killed’
‘The people were killed’Example from the text corpus:
(7) prim-""êrwe.} ‘Sheep were slaughtered.’ (B10:40)
If the agent of the action is expressed in the clause by a nominal phrase,
this is not necessarily introduced by any preposition, e.g.
(8) mú°y6lla qaráw6t dìya} mùtt6lla.} b7°a dwìq} qaráw6t dìya.} ‘They brought
her bed and laid it down. The house was filled by her bed.’
(A21:7)
Both these features reflect a certain degree of opacity regarding the status
of the patient argument as the grammatical subject of the verb. Lack of
agreement of a verb with its grammatical subject would not in principle
be possible elsewhere in the verbal system, but lack of agreement with
a grammatical object would be permissible, especially with indefinite
nominals as in (7). The lack of the preposition on the agent nominal in
examples such as (8) is a property of a grammatical subject, suggesting
that it is competing for this status with the patient nominal.","[786, 787, 788, 789]"
"syllable structure111In the stem II and stem III, on the other hand, there is a greater effort
to keep the two radicals distinct. Indeed, some stem I verbs with identical
second and third radicals have alternative middle /y/ inflections where
the two radicals are in contact, e.g. jnn ‘to sing a dirge’:
janna ( jnn) ~ j5na ( jyn)‘She sings a dirge’4.4. The Elision of Laryngals
As has been shown in §1.4.2.2, §1.4.2.4., a historical laryngal *"" is elided
when in contact with another consonant, e.g.
pala
t>ra‘worker’
‘door’< *pa""la < *pà'là
< *tar""a < *tar'àThe form t>ra must have undergone resyllabification on account of the
aforementioned principle of not having a vowel as a syllable onset, i.e.
*tar.""a > t>.ra. The shortness of the vowel in the first syllable must be
regarded as a fossilized vestige of the period when the syllable was closed,
indicating that vowel lengthening is not always in step with changes in
syllable structure.
A laryngal /""/ between vowels is sometimes elided. This is attested
between two /a/ vowels, which coalesce into one vowel nucleus. If it is
stressed, this vowel is pronounced long, even if in word final position,
where according to the normal rules of vowel length it would generally be
expected to be short, at least when in the middle of an intonation group
(§2.2.1.2.). As far as vowel lengthening is concerned, it is treated as if it
were still in an open non-final syllable. Since this type of contraction does
not regularly occur it is treated as an allegro form and not represented in
the transcription, e.g. hóle zdá""a [}zdæ[] ‘he is afraid’.
The laryngal /""/ at the beginning of a word is often elided when a
vowelless particle is prefixed to it, e.g.
(1) b-áyya dúk°a (< b-""ayya) ‘in this place’ (A13:6)
(2) b-áwwa dúša (< b-""awwa) ‘with this honey’ (A14:15)
(3) w-ána šaqlênna (< w-""ana) ‘and I shall take it’ (A14:52)
(4) w-ánna (< w-""anna) ‘and they’ (A29:50)
(5) m-áxxa l-t>màha (< m-""axxa) ‘from here to there’ (A13:11)112chapter fourThe subordinating particle D is devoiced in some cases. This devoicing
is not a blind phonetic process but is conditioned by the grammatical
category of the word to which the particle is prefixed. In principle the
devoicing takes place only when the word is a verb or a copula. The
devoicing results in an unaspirated /t/, e.g.
(6)""áwwa dúxa t-íle (< d-""ile) prìma} ‘the sacrifice that has been slaughtered’ (B5:71)
(7) ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla (< d-""ila) dmíxta kêsli} ‘this beautiful girl who
slept with me’ (A26:6)
(8) qáša ""u-šamáše t-íwa (< d-""iwa) tàma} ‘the priest and the deacons who
were there’ (B5:45)
(9) ""áw ""akàra} t-í°wale p°án6t tàwre} ‘the farmer who had the pair of oxen’
(B5:74)
(10) b8y6n t-àz6n} (< d-""az6n) ‘I want to go’ (A8:65)
(11) la-ßábr6x t-òr6x} (< d-""or6x) ‘We do not dare enter’ (A14:40)
The lack of aspiration of the unvoiced particle in these words is marked
in the transcription since it may contrast phonemically with the usual
aspirated /t/ before a vowel, as shown by minimal pairs such as:
t-aza
t-awra
t-arya
t-iwa‘that she goes’
‘that she enters’
‘that it rains’
‘who was’:
:
:
:taza
tawra
tarya
tiwa‘beautiful’
‘bull’
‘it becomes wet’
‘sitting’When the word is a demonstrative or the interrogative pronoun ""5ni, it
remains in its voiced form d-:
(12) r6š-kúlla d-áni (< d-""ani ) ‘above all of them’ (A25:22)
(13) l7w6t d-áwwa (< d-""awwa) ""à°‰a} ‘you are not from this country’
(A25:82)
(14) xóna d-o-málka (< d-""o) ‘the brother of the king’ (A25:1)
(15) báb6 d-á-brata (< d-""a-) ‘the father of the girl’ (A29:35)
(16) yíwt6lle ta-d-án (< d-""an) xulàme} ‘She gave it to the servants’ (A28:26)
(17) gu-d-7ni (< d-""5ni) mðíta x9ye?} ‘In which town does he live in?’
(A28:23)
(18) ""u-yal•xta d-ˆnila?} (< d-""5nila) ‘and whose handkerchief is it?’
(A26:12)syllable structure113On account of this variation in the phonetic realization of the particle it will
be convenient to refer to it as D, which should be understood as an abstract
representation including both the voiced and unvoiced realizations.
Occasionally a b- particle is devoiced to p- when the following laryngal
is elided. This is restricted to a few fixed expressions where the consonant
after the vowel is unvoiced, e.g.
(19) p-àqla (< b-""aqla) ‘on foot’ (B5:37)
(20) hóla p-ápe šawwà yamá°a} (< b-""ape) ‘They are beyond seven seas’
(A12:21)
The elision of the laryngal /""/ sometimes occurs also when a word with
its own vowel nucleus is combined in a stress group with a word beginning with /""/, e.g.
(21) m6n-an-m6ndiyàne} (< m6n-""an) ‘some of those things’ (A32:2)
(22) q6m-ax•lle ‘he ate it’ (A31:5)
In such cases the final consonant of the preceding word is syllabified with
the beginning of the word that has lost the /""/, since a syllable cannot
begin with a vowel. This resyllabification does not result in any change
in vowel length, just as the vowel in words such as t>ra (< *tar""a < *tar'à)
remains short. It has, however, sometimes motivated the lengthening of
the final consonant, allowing it to act as onset of the following syllable
while remaining also the coda of the preceding one. This lengthening is
not marked in the transcription:
(23) q6m-axlíla [q6m.mæx.}li[.læ] (< q6m-""axlila) ‘They ate them’ (A23:35)
(24) qam-7nux [qæm.m}5[.nÛx] (< qam-""5nux) ‘before your eyes’ (A15:15)
(25) ta-t-axlíwale [tæt.tæx.}li[.wæ].le] ‘in order to eat it’ (A14:68)
An initial /""/ is sometimes elided also when a preceding stressed word ends
in a consonant and the vowel forms a syllable with this consonant across
the word boundary. In such cases the elision of the /""/ is not represented
in the transcription, e.g.
(26) f•ll6n ""àti} [}f6ll6n }æ[ti[] ‘you so-and-so’ (B5:9)
(27) q7m6n ""àz6n} [}q5m6n }æ[z6n] (A1:4)
(28) d6-šqúl ""anna-zùze.} [d6-}∫qÛl æn[æ-}zu[ze] (A1:27)114chapter fourThe elision of the /""/ is not obligatory in any of these contexts and in
many cases it is retained, e.g.
(29) m6n-""6srí dináre [m6n-""6s}ri] ‘from twenty dinars’ (B5:8)
(30) bas-""í°wa [bæs-}""i°wâ] ‘but there was’ (A8:2)
(31) ""èn ""amrênnux} [}""6n ""æm}rinnÛx] ‘If I tell you’ (A1:12)
(32) mu°7lux ""ánna zúze} [mu]}°5[lÛx }""ænnæ] ‘You have brought these
coins’ (A1:27)
The laryngal also occurs sometimes after vowelless particles, but in such
cases the particle does not cluster with the laryngal in the onset of the
syllable, since the sequence /C""/ is not permissible as a syllable onset.
Rather it is syllabified with the preceding word or the cluster is broken
by a prosthetic or epenthetic vowel, e.g.
(33) báxte díye láwa píšta b-""ùrxa} [}pi∫.tæb. }""Ûrxæ] ‘His wife was not on the
way (to having a child)’ (A8:4)
(34) qímela mšox•lpe b-""is6qyà°a} [m∫o[.}x6l.peb.""i[.s6q.}jæ[.°æ] ‘They exchanged rings’ (A26:7)
(35) ta-t-áxl6n b-""ùrxa} [""6b.-}""Ûrxæ] ‘so that I could eat (it) on the way’
(A23:8)
Resyllabification does not take place across intonation group boundaries,
so at the beginning of an intonation group such a cluster is always broken
by a prosthetic or epenthetic vowel, e.g.
(36) mèra d°s} bábi.} b-""ùrxa} [""6b.}""Û{.xæ] lát-xila xa-l•xma-w xa-bèta?} ‘She
said “(He’s) right, father. On the way did you not eat a loaf of
bread and an egg?”’ (A17:15)
A laryngal /h/ within the interior of a word is sometimes elided. This is
attested between two /a/ vowels, which coalesce into one vowel nucleus. If
it is stressed, this vowel is pronounced long, even if in word final position,
where according to the normal rules of vowel length it would generally be
expected to be short, at least when in the middle of an intonation group
(§2.2.1.2.). As far as vowel lengthening is concerned it is treated as if it
were still in an open non-final syllable.
(37) t>màha} [tæ}mæ[] ‘over there’ (A2:5)
(38) "">wáha [""â}wâ[] ‘that one over there’ (A27:5)
(39) b-álaha [}bæ[læ] ‘by God’ (A1:5)syllable structure115It also takes place in fast speech when in contact with a preceding consonant, e.g.
(40) múrra tóti t-á°ya mh5ràli} [m5}{æ[li] ‘Tell my grandmother to come
and help me’ (A7:25)
Since these two aforementioned types of elision of /h/ do not take place
regularly they are not marked in the transcription.
A laryngal /h/ is elided at the beginning of a word after a vowelless
prefixed particle in some cases. This is regularly the case with the verb
hwy ‘to be’, e.g. y-áwe ‘he is’ (< ""i-hawe), t-awe ‘he will be’ (< b6d-hawe). Note
the contraction and devoicing of the future particle.
It is occasionally elided when the previous word ends in a consonant.
As with the elision of /""/ in such a context, this is not marked in the
transcription, e.g.
(41) xá‘‘a xéna biš-hód6x [bi.}∫o[.d6x] ‘a little further on’ (A7:22)
(42) hàl qèßß6t hàtx5la} [}q6ß.ß6.}tæt.x5læ] ‘The situation is like this’
(A24:32)
The sequence CV + ""V sometimes contracts to CV at the juncture between
words. For the sake of orthographic consistency, this contraction is not
represented in the transcription. It occurs both where the two vowels are
the same and also where they are different qualities.
(i) Contraction of two vowels of the same quality.
This is attested particularly frequently in the text corpus when the
vowels have the quality of /a/, e.g.
(43) qím5le mkúpš6lla kúlla ""ànna} [}kÛl.}læn.næ] ‘He gathered them all up’
(A7:5)
(44) kúlla-""ani [}kÛl.læ[.ni] q6m-qa†lìla} ‘They killed all of them’ (A13:9)
(45) m5y•nna ""ay-bàxta} [m5]}jin.n æj.-}bæx.tæ] ‘I shall bring that woman’
(A4:9)
(46) dì‰t5la ""áy} [}d_‰.t5.læj] ‘She returned’ (A24:50)
(47) xa-b6‰-náša xéna lá-""am6ß [}læ[.-á!6ß] xáya tàma} ‘Another person cannot live there’ (A8:48)
(48) ""7-ga ""ana-mˆ°6n.} [}""5[.-gæ[.næ] ‘when I die’ (A12:41)
(49) ""ána mò-""oð6n?} [}mo[.ð6n] ‘What should I do?’ (A23:23)116chapter four(ii) Vowels of different quality
In general the final vowel of the first word tends to be elided if it is
an unstressed /e/ or /a/, e.g.
(50) mpìlle-"">ra [""6m.}pil.læ.{æ] gáwza} ‘The walnut has fallen on the
ground’ (A1:5)
(51) ‘rík6lle ""aw-bˆ°a} [}t∫ri[.k6l.l æw.}b5[°æ] ‘They surrounded that house’
(A4:53)
(52) hadíya m>‰6šánne ""áwwa [mæ.‰!6.}∫æn.}nâw.wâ] 'afr≈t qa†êll5xu} ‘Now I
shall wake this demon and he will kill you’ (A13:12)
(53) ""ítle ""árbi [}""it.}l æ{.bi] bnà°a} ‘He has forty daughters’ (A12:2)
(54) ""arbí-""otaxe ""ì°wal6x} [""o].tâ]}x.i°.wâ].l6x] ‘You had forty rooms’
(A24:34)
(55) ""ána wáð6n} be-baxtù°a ""èllux} [be].-bæx}tu[.° 6l.lÛx] ‘I am performing
treachery against you’ (A13:8)
(56) muxzélux ""áwwa x>zìna-""6lli} [xæ.}zi[.n 6l.li] ‘You showed this treasure
to me’ (A14:23)
(57) b-àyya ""úrxa} [}bæj.}j Û{.xæ] ‘in this way’ (A9:4)
(58) tèmm6l ""ana-""ê°y6n} [""æ].}ni°.jin] ‘I came yesterday’ (A12:66)
Unstressed /i/, /u/ and /o/ at the end of the first word, on the other
hand, tend to be preserved, e.g.
(59) ""áti ""6n-yaw•llux [}""æ[.ti n-] ðà-taw6rta} ‘If he gives you a cow’ (A3:4)
(60) ""áp-""ati ""ê°y6t} [}""æp-""æ[.}ti °.y6t] ‘You also came’ (A2:9)
(61) šár†6n gu-""i°á°6 [gu.-}°æ[.°6] d-áwwa nàša} ‘I shall escape from the
hands of this man’ (A31:30)
If the final vowel of the first word is stressed, it is generally the one that
is retained after the contraction irrespective of its quality, e.g.
(62) kút-yum xá ""6rbe-díye [}xæ {.be] talêqwa} ‘Every day a sheep of his was
lost’ (A10:1)
(63) mò-""aw6ð [}mo[.-w6ð] b-g yáne?} ‘What should he do with himself ?’
(A30:28)
In a few cases the /""/ in the sequence CV + ""V is replaced by a glide
consonant when the two vowels are of a different quality, e.g.
(64) mo-""ìba?} [mo[.}ji[.bæ] ‘What is in it?’ (A13:1)syllable structure117The sequence CV + hV, with the laryngal /h/, is sometimes contracted
to CV across a word boundary. This contraction is not marked in the
transcription, e.g.
(65) ""ána háw6n [}""æ[.}næ[.w6n] Gozàli} ‘I should be Gozali’ (A8:55)
(66) ""ána mo-hoyàli?} [mo[.}jæ[.li] ‘What could she be to me?’ (A32:12)
(67) lá-haw6t [}læ[.w6t] šeðàna} ‘Don’t be mad’ (A10:8)
4.5. Other Contractions and Elisions
Various other contractions of syllables take place in natural fast speech.
These can be categorized as follows:
4.5.1. Syllables Beginning with Identical Consonants
In a sequence of two syllables beginning with the same consonant, the first
is sometimes elided. This generally takes place where the first consonant
is preceded by a vowel and the second occurrence of the consonant is
geminate thus:
VCVCCV>VCCVSuch contractions occur mainly in the endings of verbal forms with
pronominal suffixes. It regularly takes placed when a pronominal object
L-suffix is bonded to a compound verbal form ending in a 3rd person
copula:
q†íl6lle
gráš6lle‘He has killed him’
‘He is pulling him’< q†íl5le + lle
< gráš5le + lleSince the contraction in this context is the norm, it is represented in the
transcription. The endings of 3rd person compound verbal forms with
pronominal suffixes are sometimes contracted further in verbs whose third
radical is /l/, e.g.
(1) xìl6lle} [}xi[l[le] ‘They ate him’ (A14:22)
(2) šqíl6lla [}∫qi[l[æ] ""álpa dàwe} ‘He took the thousand gold pieces’
(A1:15)
(3) ""áp-xa lá-°ele šqàl6lle [}∫qæ[l[e] ‘Nobody came to buy it’ (A22:9)118chapter four(4) ""a-súst6t yamà°a} nabòl6lla} [næ[bo[l[æ] ’6lk9ze} ‘The mare of the seas
is taking away ’6lk>ze’ (A12:34)
The stressed vowel in these contracted forms remains long, as if it were
still in an open syllable. The contracted compound past forms with suffixes
are, therefore, distinguished from the non-compound past forms only by
the length of the vowel:
šqílle [}∫qil[e]
šqíl6lle [}∫qi[l[e]‘He took’
‘He has taken it’Since, however, this type of contraction does not regularly take place, it
is treated as an allomorph of the normal uncontracted form and is not
represented in the transcription.
A syllabic contraction of the type VCVCCV > VCCV occasionally occurs
when the 1st person singular verbal inflection -6n follows an /n/ that
belongs to the verbal root, e.g.
(5) hálli banênni [bæ[n[i] xa-b7°a} ‘Let me build myself a house’
(A11:10)
(6) hadíya mtán6nnux [}mtæ[n[Ûx] ða-q6ßßêtta} ‘Now I shall tell you a story’
(A45:1)
4.5.2. Elision of /l/
The articulation of the consonant /l/ occurring after a vowel in the copula
or L-suffixes attached to a verb is occasionally weakened in the speech of
a number of informants and is elided outside the contexts described in
§4.4.1. If the vowels on either side of the /l/ are homorganic or closely
related they coalesce into a single vowel, e.g.
(1) ""6n-twírwala [}twi[{wâ] t•rna ‘If both have broken’ (B5:59)
(2) ""í°walan [}""i]°wân] ‘we had’ (B5:206)
(3) °éle [}°e[] ‘He came’ (A34:5)
(4) q6m-daryála [q6m-d6{}jæ[] ‘She has put it’ (A34:6)
(5) l7ð6x ""ˆk5la [""5[k5] ‘We do not know where she is’ (A34:7)
(6) ""u-zeðáye šwíqile [}∫wi[qi] ‘He left the flat breads’ (A30:12)
If the two adjacent vowels are not homorganic the elided /l/ is replaced
by a glide, e.g.","[149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"
"When the fronted prepositional phrase bears the nuclear stress, it expresses
an information focus, the rest of the clause being presuppositional, or at
least less prominent, e.g.
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)""ána b-àrbe lánwa zwán6lle} zawnènne b-†ê¬¬6°?} ‘I would not buy it with
four legs, would I buy it with three?’ (A22:8)
""aw-t-lá-šax6n b-zráqt6t šêmša} b-gnˆ°a la-šáx6n.} ‘He who does not get
warm with the rising of the sun, does not get warm at its setting.’
(D2:21)
""ána qa-S6ttìye b8y6n.} ‘I love S6ttiy6 (not anybody else).’ (A25:22)
dáx lítl6x xá†6r bàxta,} ""u-bt-à°6n} gu-d-ànna ""7ni bt-á°6n.} ‘Of course,
you are welcome, my lady. I shall come. By these eyes (of mine) I
shall come.’ (A22:20)In such cases the short prepositions b- and l- are occasionally omitted on
the focused item, e.g.
(9)har-gubbàn6x (< b-gubban6x) wíð6lle.} ‘We made it exactly according
to a spirit-level.’ (A17:20)
(10) kut-""èrba ""aql6t-gàne (< b-""aql6t-gàne) páy6š tèlya.} ‘Every sheep is hung
up by his own legs.’ (D2:55)
(11) ""áyya yalêxta} bàbila (< l-bàbila) zqírta} ""u-xá°i Nasìmola (< l-Nasimola)
mnuqášta.} ‘This handkerchief was woven by my father and embroidered by my sister Nasimo.’ (A37:12)884chapter seventeen17.7.12. Placement of Adverbials
The placement of adverbials in relation to other components in the clause
is conditioned by a number of factors. We shall consider here both verbal and copula clauses, since the conditioning factors are the same. The
majority of adverbials that occur in the text corpus are temporal or spatial
expressions. The various positions can be classified as follows.
17.7.12.1. In Clause Initial Position
Temporal or spatial adverbials that stand at the front of a clause in
principle mark a shift in the discourse and set the temporal or spatial
frame for what follows. This frame often incorporates a series of clauses.
Examples:
(1) xá-yoma ßlèle,} ""ína šmíle xzéle ""ína †ê¬¬6°-yawne tíwla táma.} ‘One day he
went down and heard (something) and saw that three doves had
alighted there.’ (A14:81)
(2) xá-yoma ßléla gu-gòma.} ríx6t júlla díya °èle.} mèra hóla làxxa.} ‘One day
she went down into the basement. The scent of her clothes came
to her. She said “They are there.’’ ’ (A14:100)
(3) šúry5le zráya hàl-""aß6rta.} ""aßèrta ""á°e l-bˆ°a.} ‘He began cultivating (and
continued) until evening. In the evening he came home.’ (A21:12)
The temporal frame may be set by a distributive adverbial expression,
e.g.
(4) kút yom6t-šáb°a míya là-hawe gu-néra.} ‘Every Saturday there is no water
in the river.’ (A14:50)
(5) ""u-kut-šéta xa-gáya y-oðèxwa m6n-d-o-""ùpra.} ‘Once every year, we would
collect this mud.’ (B10:68)
(6) kut-yárxa t-yánnux xámši dinàre.} ‘Every month I shall give you fifty
dinars.’ (A24:5)
In descriptive discourse, some kind of shift is often marked by a reidentification of the temporal frame by an anaphoric adverbial such as ""5-ga ‘at
that time’ or tama ‘there’. In (7), for example, these adverbials are used in
a clause that occurs at the beginning of a section of discourse concerning the churn. The reidentification is also used to mark a shift from the
foreground discourse to a background comment (8):the clause
(7)
(8)885""7-ga táma gu-ma°wá°a k6slˆni} ""í°wal6n gùða.} ‘At that time, there in
our community in the villages, we had a churn.’ (B7:20)
maxíwa ""ilàna.} ""7-ga lì°wa kéka.} y-asqíwa l-gàre,} ""5-dán6 m5°íwala k yàlo,}
napßìwala.} ‘They would set up the tree. At that time there was
no cake. They would go up onto the roof, at the time when they
brought the bride and shook it.’ (B10:27)In narrative the initial adverbial may express the point at which an event
takes place, e.g.
(9) bár †¬a°a-yóme dì‰‰e.} ‘After three days he returned.’ (A3:6)
(10) ßêlyela.} yom6t-†¬á°a mê†yela} l-Amedìa.} ‘They went down. On the third
day they reached Amedia.’ (A25:77)
On some occasions the initial adverbial is placed in a separate intonation
group. The effect of this is to disjoin more forcefully the clause from what
precedes. Some of the examples of such adverbials in the text corpus are
numerical expressions such as those in (13)–(15), which denote members
of a limited set of points or periods in time. The added disjunctive effect
of placing the adverbial in a separate intonation group marks these off
distinctly in contrastive opposition:
(11) xa-yòma} qímla zílla mêra} t-áz6x l-""êrwe.} ‘One day they set off and
said “Let’s go to the sheep.” ’ (A25:23)
(12) ""o-lèle} y-azèxwa be-k yàlo.} ‘That night we would go to the house of
the bride’s family.’ (B5:28)
(13) bén6 †ê¬¬6°} nàpla} bàxta.} ‘The third time the wife fell.’ (A20:11)
(14) yóm6t trè} ""ay-là xílla.} ‘On the second day she did not eat.’ (A21:14)
(15) yóm6t xàmša,} qímla ""áy m-b8dal xmá°a dìya.} ‘On the fifth day, she got
up instead of her mother-in-law.’ (A21:22)
An initial adverbial that is not placed in a separate intonation group on
some occasions takes the nuclear stress. This is used to put a narrow
information focus on the adverbial. In clauses containing a copula, the
copula is placed on the adverbial, e.g.
(16) kúlla lˆlela l-bálux?} ‘Has it been on your mind all night?’ (A25:67)886chapter seventeenWhen narrow focus is placed on anaphoric adverbial expressions, its
function is to strengthen the anaphoric bond with what precedes. In (17)
and (18) the adverbial ‘at that time’ binds the clause with what precedes
rather than setting the temporal frame for what follows:
(17) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
(18) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,} ""áskar
t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ‘I remember
the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune.
At that time Š6mmo married.’ (B8:21)
By contrast, in (19) the initial adverbial is not marked by the nucleus and
it sets the temporal frame for what follows. The copula on the adverbial
here signals topical rather than focal prominence (§15.4.1.4.1. ii):
(19) ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘At that time the borders were
moved, they were moved up to Turkey.’ (B9:21)
When the anaphoric adverbial hatxa has narrow focus, it likewise links the
clause to what precedes, e.g.
(20) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse,} max-d-ánna t-ásqi "">bu-bêrqa.} ""áxni hàtx5wa
semált6n ""ap-""áxni.} ‘A ladder is made of wood, like the ones that the
electricity workers climb up, our ladder was like that.’ (B10:60)
(21) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king repled to me thus.’ (A17:34)
(22) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše.} ‘You should treat people like this.’ (A22:47)
In (23), on the other hand, where it is does not have the nucleus, it is
forward pointing:
(23) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situation is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
A backwarding linking function is performed also by the focused spatial
adverbials ""axxa ‘here’ and tama ‘there’ in (24)–(27). In (26) and (27) these
occur after a subject constituent, but their function is the same:the clause887(24) dámx6x š-gêšra,} biš-salàm6t-ile.} ""áxxa xuwwáwe ma-xuwwáwe lˆ-y-a°5
l-d-áwwa gèšra.} ""àxxa damxéxi.} ‘Let’s sleep on the bridge. It is safer.
Here—snakes and the like will not come onto this bridge. Let’s
sleep here.’ (A30:49)
(25) ""7ka ßà†qa} tàma z>réti.} ‘Wherever she squats down, you should
plough there.’ (A30:4)
(26) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa

‘That place where we were baptized, of course all our ancestors
were baptized there.’ (B3:21)
17.7.12.2. Adverbial in Clause Final Position
When temporal or spatial adverbials are placed at the end of the clause,
they, in principle, do not mark a shift in the discourse by setting the
temporal or spatial frame for what follows. Rather the clauses in which
they occur are cohesively bound to what precedes. This is seen in (1) and
(2), in which the adverbials are anaphoric. The clause with the adverbial
‘at that time’ in (1) develops the description of ‘mats’, which have been
introduced in the preceding clause. In (2), from a narrative, the clause
with the adverbial ‘on that day’ does not introduce a new episode, but
rather recapitulates on an event that has already been related:
(1)
(2)""í°wa y-amrèxwa xaßìra.} xaßíre m5°7wala m-mðinà°a ""7-ga.} ‘There was
a mat, as we called it. They brought the mats from the towns at
that time.’ (B5:199)

mullah. . . . They put up in a hotel. . . . . They put up in the hotel
that day and remained there.’ (A2:2)17.7.13. Clauses with an Interrogative Constituent
Interrogative particles that function as a subject, object or adverbial in the
clause are in principle placed before the verb. The nuclear stress is placed
either on the fronted particle or at the end of the intonation group. If
the verb is a compound form containing a copula, the copula is attached
to the interrogative particle:888

módi wìdle?} ‘What did he do?’ (A20:5)
mó t-òð6x?} ‘What shall we do?’ (A14:47)
mó b9y6t?} ‘What do you want?’ (A12:62)
mòditu xèzye?} ‘What have you seen?’ (A12:16)
†la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why did you do that to me?’ (A15:14)
""ˆnile q†íl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
""7ka p7š6n ""àrxa?} ‘Where can I be a guest?’ (A26:26)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally not placed
between the interrogative particle and the verb, but rather is positioned
either before the interrogative particle or after the verb. The decision to
place the subject at the front or end of the clause is conditioned by the
discourse factors that have been discussed above (§17.7.2.), e.g.
(9) Barzèkko módi wìdle?} ‘What did Barz6kko do?’ (A12:7)
(10) x6yál5xu mù-q†ila?} ‘What have you decided? (literally: What have
your thoughts decided?)’ (B5:2)
(11) ""ána mò-""oð6n?} ‘What should I do?’ (A21:2)
(12) w-áti mò t-amrètli?} ‘What will you say to me?’ (A17:33)
(13) ""áxni mò t-áxl6x?} ‘What shall we eat?’ (A10:5)
(14) ""áwwa mòdile wíða?} ‘What did he do?’ (A22:27)
(15) mót mára ""àti?} ‘What do you say?’ (A25:21)
(16) mò ""awðéna ""ána hadíya?} ‘What should I do now?’ (A26:13)
(17) mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} ‘What dog have you given birth to?’
(A11:20)
In a few sporadic cases the subject intervenes between the interrogative
particle and the verb, e.g.
(18) mút ""áti tíwta làxxa?} ‘Why are you sitting here?’ (A25:58)
The interrogative particle mo is used to express exclamation in constructions such as (19), in which the verb is repeated:
(19) qìmta} mgašóqe hàtxa,} mo-mgàšqa!} ‘She got up and looked and what
(a sight) she sees!’ (A25:59)the clause889This construction is used also with intransitive verbs, e.g.
(20) ""ánna ßàli} ""ína mò ßáli!} ‘They went and what (a surprise when) they
went down! (A25:13)
(21) dmíx5le xá-bena ‰ày6š} ""ina mò ‰áy6š!} ‘He went to sleep, then woke up,
but what (a surprise when) he woke!’ (A14:30)
The adverbial interrogative particle dax is used also in a longer form daxi.
The occurrence of the longer form is prosodically conditioned, in that it
occurs predominantly in pause at the end of an intonation group, as is
the case with the long forms of verbal inflections (§15.12.), e.g.
(22) dàxi?} ‘How (could this be)?’ (A25:69)
(23) báxta dìya dáxi?} ‘Wife, now how (can we solve the problem)?’
(A20:9)
17.7.14. Negated Verbal Clauses
17.7.14.1. Negative Particle before Verb
When a verbal clause is negated, the negative particle la is normally
placed immediately before the verb. Various stress patterns are attested
in relation to this particle. In some cases it is stressed and in others it is
unstressed (§6.4.). It takes the nuclear stress of the intonation group when
the speaker wishes to give the negation particular prominence. This is
found predominantly in the following circumstances.
(i) Negated Deontic Expressions
When the negated verb has a deontic modality, such as a prohibition
addressed to the hearer or an expression of deontic intention by the
speaker, the negator is often given prominence, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)là mtalpètle} là-daqr6t bíye.} ‘Do not harm him! Do not touch him!’
(A26:73)
là maßí°6t!} ‘Do not listen!’ (A26:11)
là-mßaw°6t!} ‘Do not speak!’ (A26:89)
bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)
là maštóla míya!} ‘Do not give them water to drink!’ (A25:9)
""ána là-""a°6n mènnux!} ‘I shall not come with you!’ (A6:6)
là-""awr6n gu-má°a!} ‘I shall not go into the village!’ (A25:34)890chapter seventeen(ii) Adversative Contexts
The negator is given prominence when the clause defeats an expectation
that arises from what precedes, e.g.
(1) spírra spìrra} bróna díya là °éle.} ‘She waited and waited, but her son
did not come.’ (A14:21)
(2) ták-tak mxáy6lla goyá°6 sùsa} ta-t-dày6‰ súsa m-táma,} là-jwijle súsa.} ‘He
struck the sides of the horse so that the horse would move away
from there, (but) the horse did not move.’ (A26:28)
(3) mèra t-ásq6n ta-t-axèlli xùwwe.} mère ""ána t-á°6n mênn6x.} ""áti xúwwe là
""axèll6x.} ‘She said “I am going up in order for the snake to eat
me.” He said “I shall come with you. The snake will not eat you.” ’
(A24:39)
(iii) Contrastive Oppositions
When the negated clause is set up in a contrastive opposition with what
precedes, the negator, which is the focus of contrast, has the nucleus,
e.g.
(1) mèra ""ána báxt6t ""á©6t ô?l-iw6n.} ""áyya xmá°a díya homênna.} x6myána
homênne.} bróna homênne.} kúlla homênna.} kál°a là homènna.} ‘She said “I
am the wife of the a©a of ôàl.” Her mother-in-law believed it. Her
father-in-law believed it. The son believed it. Everybody believed
it. The daughter-in-law, however, did not believe it.” ’ (A19:2)
(2) réši parmênne} ""u-réš6x là parmènne.} ‘I shall cut off my head. I shall not
cut off your head’ (A14:35)
(iv) Verb mßy ‘to be able’
(1) ""ána là-mß6n t-á°6n mènnux hátxa.} ‘I cannot come with you in that
case.’ (A26:18)
(2) ""ána là-mß6n ma°yánne.} ‘I cannot bring him back.’ (A25:75)
(3) †¬á gáye súse dìye} °éle ta-t-šàw6r} là mßéle.} ‘Three times his horse came
up to jump but could not do so.’ (A25:55)
(4) zmìrra,} là-mßela bíyi.} ‘She sang and could not beat me.’ (A25:69)
(v) Negator Combined with Intensifier
In some cases a negator with the nuclear stress is combined with the
intensifying particle xo-/xu-, e.g.","[922, 923, 924, 925, 926, 927, 928, 929]"
"the syntax of verbs625(21) ""ána spày-iw6n.} ‘I am good.’
(22) ""áti spày-iw6t.} ‘You are good.’
It can be seen, therefore, that the construction in which the enclitic copula
is attached to the predicate is used irrespective of the topicality of the
subject nominal.
The construction is also unmarked with regard to the communicative
salience of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is reflected by
its usage irrespective of the factivity of the proposition. It is used both
in factive and non-factive propositions. Clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to its factuality. Non-factive propositions do not involve
such commitment and are low in communicative salience. This applies,
for example, to interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is being
questioned, e.g.
(23) bróne díye spày-ile} ‘His son is good’
(24) bróne díye spày-ile?} ‘Is his son good?’
The present enclitic copula sometimes has a past tense reference in clauses
that are syntactically subordinated to or closely associated with a clause
with a past verb form, e.g.
(25) Fárxo mêre} ""áp-""ana m†ál6n m6nnˆxu.} zòr5le.} ‘Farxo said “I also shall
play with you.” He was young.’ (A25:87)
(26) ""u-""5-Lelí°a °èla.} ""áy kúlla dòn5la,} dòna,} mêšxa.} ""ína °éla l-t9ra.} ‘The
Leli°a came. She was all (made of) fat, fat, oil. She came to the
door.’ (A19:4)
(27) ßlèla,} tfíqla mu'àll6m.} mu'àll6m,} d6kkána gò‰t5la.} ‘She went down
and met the teacher. The teacher—the shop (he was in) was big.’
(A22:18)
(28) qìmt5la} wíðt6lle ""ixàla,} bè""e.} qèdamt5la.} ‘She made him food, some
eggs. It was early morning.’ (A23:4)
15.3.1.2. The Independent Basic Copula
The independent basic copula is marked with regard to the nature of the
predicate and subject and also with regard to the communicative salience
of the proposition expressed by the clause.
There are restrictions with regard to the type of predicate and subject
that occur in this construction. The predicate is identificatory or expresses626chapter fifteena permanent property of the subject, which is typically an intrinsic defining property rather than an acquired property. It is not used when the
predicate denotes a contingent situation. The subject of the construction
is always high in topicality. There is no restriction, however, regarding the
referential status of the subject, in that it may have a specific referent or
denote a generic class. This is illustrated in the following examples,
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
""ána ""íw6n Yúw6l Yu˙ànna.} ‘I am Yuw6l Yu˙anna.’ (A1:1)
""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
""áwwa ""íle sulàqa.} ‘This is the (festival of) Ascension.’ (B6:7)
b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
(A26:55)
(6) ""í°wal6n ßàwma,} yá'ni ""éða y-a°éwa m6n-ßàwma.} ßáwma ""íle xamšì yomá°a.}
‘We had a fast, that is the festival came after a fast. The fast is fifty
days.’ (B5:52)
(7) ""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
(8) °áy5le qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ""ó gnúna ""íle nišànqa.} ‘The priest comes
and ties the band. The band is a symbol.’ (B5:44)
(9) ""u-kùt-xa} ""ítle góm6t g yàne,} ""ítle dúka mruzágta y-amrèxla dùna.} . . . góma
""íle gawàye,} dúna ""íle qam-t9ra.} ‘Everybody has his own basement
stable and a place prepared (for feeding), which we call a duna
(feeding pen). . . . The basement stable is inside and the feeding
pen is outside.’ (B5:110)
(10) xàr°a} y-a°él5ni ""èða} ""éð6t be-yàlda.} ""éð6t be-yálda ""íle w7°6t Mšìxa.} ‘Then
we have (another) festival, the festival of Christmas. The festival of
Christmas is (in commemoration of) the birth of Christ.’ (B6:12)
The high topicality of the subject item in (4)–(10) arises from the fact that
its referent has been referred to in the immediately preceding discourse,
where it is an item of central concern. In the case of full nominal subjects, moreover, the nominal itself has typically been mentioned in the
preceding clause, as can be seen in the examples. Constructions such as
(1)–(3) with 1st person pronominal subjects, however, often occur at the
beginning of speech. One factor contributing to the high topicality of the
subject referent could be that the referent of the pronoun is present and
observable by the hearer in the speech situation. Another factor is thatthe syntax of verbs627such clauses are typically used at the beginning of a speech in which the
first person referent plays a prominent role in the subsequent clauses. We
may call this forward pointing topicality. This is the case, for example,
with the discourse following the clause adduced in (1) above, which is
reproduced below:
(11) ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo,} . . . hon-""è°ya †láb6lla bràtux,} nablènna
†la-bàbi.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl . . . I have come seeking the hand
of your daughter, in order to take her to my father.’ (A29:63)
A construction with an independent copula is marked with regard to
communicative salience. It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive
propositions, which are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to their factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive
propositions such as interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is
being questioned. If the clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the
predicate is used. This is illustrated in (12), which contains assertive and
interrogative clauses:
(12) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
""6štà-yomela?} yarx7xu ""6sri-w-""6óóà-yomele?} ‘A week for us is seven days
and a month is thirty days. Is your week six weeks? Is your month
twenty-nine days?’ (A17:13)
The communicative salience of the construction gives the clause a degree
of independence from the preceding discourse. This is often exploited to
express some kind of reorientation in the discourse. When the subject is
a 3rd person pronoun or a nominal that has been mentioned in the preceding discourse, the construction is generally used to express some kind
of elaborative background on what precedes. It can be seen as a device
to mark a boundary or discontinuity in the flow of the discourse. This is
a common discourse usage of contructions with communicative salience.
Alternatively communicative salience of the construction is sometimes
exploited to give prominence to a statement deemed to be of particular
importance. This applies especially to clauses with a 1st or 2nd person
pronominal subject (1–3). These often occur at the beginning of a section
of discourse.
When the subject of the independent copula is pronominal, in some
cases it is expressed only by the inflection of the copula and is not realized by an independent pronoun, e.g.","[663, 664, 665, 666]"

the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
""o-m6nn7xu t-dàq6r} b-M9mo} ‘whoever of you touches M>mo . . .’
(A26:68)When the referent of a definite antecedent noun has the role of direct
object in the relative clause it is resumed by a pronominal object pronoun,
whether the clause is restrictive or non-restrictive, e.g.
(6)
(7)""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
(A26:64)The resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the relative clause, e.g.
(8)""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)In the relative clause of (9) the clause embedded under the verb b>y6t ‘you
want’ that would have contained the resumptive pronoun has been elided:
(9)šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘The sapling—you put it in the
land that you want (to put it in).’ (B5:103)When the antecedent noun is indefinite with a non-specific referent and
the relative clause is restrictive, there is generally no resumptive pronominal direct object, e.g.
(10) hálli xá-m6ndi t-àxl6n.} ‘Give me something to eat (literally: that I
may eat).’ (A26:57)
(11) kú-mdit t-yáw6l †làlux} ""áp ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè.} ‘Everything that he
gives to you, he will give also to your neighbour, twofold.’ (A3:4)

(13) ""áwwa kú-mdit mßaw•°wa ’ùxo,} ’ùxo,} ’ùxo.} ‘Everything that he
spoke (= on every occasion that he spoke) (people would say) ’uxo,
’uxo, ’uxo.’ (A7:1)972chapter nineteenWhen the interrogative pronoun mo ‘what’ functions as an indefinite pronoun at the head of a restrictive relative, there is likewise no resumptive
object pronoun, e.g.
(14) mo-t-ámr6t wúð hàd6x.} ‘Do whatever you say (= whatever you think
best).’ (A8:17)
When, on the other hand, an indefinite antecedent noun has a specific
referent and the following clause is non-restrictive, a pronominal object
suffix is used, e.g.
(15) q6m-xazéle xa-nàša} mì°a} naból6lle m†amòr6lle.} ‘He saw a dead person,
whom they were taking to bury.’ (A17:1)
(16) ""ína hóla xá-qay6m°a k°íwta tàma,} málka Šlémun k°ìw6lla.} ‘They found
there an inscribed monument, which king Solomon had written.’
(A14:55)
(17) ""ítl6n xá-m6ndi b8y6x t-oð•xxe †làl6x.} ‘We have something (in mind)
which we want to do for you.’ (A4:48)
This distribution of resumptive pronominal suffixes can be interpreted
as reflecting the different syntactic status of restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses. In restrictive clauses the head nominal, or at least
the relative particle D, is treated as the direct object of the verb in the
clause. Since indefinite objects in principle do not take object agreement
suffixes (§15.13.2.2.), there is no resumptive agreement suffix on the verb.
The occurrence of the pronominal suffix in non-restrictive clauses reflects
the fact that they have the status of independent clauses. Since, on the
other hand, definite direct objects in principle regularly co-occur with
pronominal agreement suffixes, this distinction in structure is not reflected
in the suffixes and the pronominal suffix occurs in both restrictive and
non-restrictive clauses.
If the referent of the head nominal is the complement of a noun in the
relative clause, it is obligatorily represented by a resumptive pronoun, e.g.
(18) ""í°wa xa-""á©a gu-Bˆrw6r,} š•mme Raš‰d-bek.} ‘There was an agha in
Barwar whose name was Rašid Bek.’ (B19:1)
(19) ""áxtu kúll5xu ‘ìdetu} l-b7°6t màlka} t-íla Gozáli ""u-Nozáli gu-b6°-dìye.} ‘You
are all invited to the house of the king, in whose house Gozali and
Nozali are staying.’ (A8:89)syntactic subordination of clauses973When the antecedent noun has the syntactic relation of an adverbial in
the relative clause that could be expressed without a preposition, there is
generally no pronominal resumption when the clause is restrictive. This
is the case with temporal adverbials (20–22) and the destination of verbs
of movement (23) (§14.13.):
(20) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die,
I shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)
(21) ""7-g6t ""an-yomá°a t-awéwa ràba séra} . . . j>míwa kúlla ""ùrze,} jwànqe.} ‘On

(22) hót m-ó-yom6 t-íx ""axni-zíle ""áti d•ry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘From the day that
we went away you have held him in prison.’ (A26:76)
(23) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux} là †arðílux.} ‘Every home that you go
to will give you something.’ (B7:7)
If the role of the head in the relative clause would be normally expressed
by a locative preposition in an independent clause, the preposition is
sometimes still omitted when the clause is restrictive. This is found where
the locative role would be expected to be expressed by the preposition
gu-, b- or m6n-, e.g.
(24) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
could be.’ (B9:29)
(25) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} ‘In the
end God made him come across the town where the daughter of
that king was.’ (A4:11)
(26) d6-púš làxxa} gu-d-ay-šwí°a t-wewa-dmíxa xòn6x.} ‘Stay here, in the bed
in which your brother slept.’ (A8:68)
(27) hon-d•ry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pal6†.} ‘I put him in
a deep pit from which he could never come out.’ (A22:41)
In some cases, however, the preposition is used in a restrictive relative
clause with a pronominal suffix resuming the head, e.g.
(28) ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)
(29) m†éle gu-t8r6t ""ó-b5°a t-íla-wirta gàwe.} ‘He reached the door of the
house in which she had entered.’ (A34:11)974chapter nineteen(30) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
following now.’ (A21:35)
If the clause is non-restrictive, a preposition with resumptive pronoun is
regularly used, e.g.
(31) ""í°wa xa-g•ppa gáwe díye ""àrbi hambišáye.} ‘There was a cave in which
there were forty giants.’ (A24:54)
A preposition is regularly used in all types of clauses if this is other than
the locative prepositions gu- or b-, e.g.
(32) d•ry5le ""an-b>†aníye xo°a-díya t-wewa-dmíxa Gozáli rèša.} ‘He placed
under her the blankets that Gozali had slept on.’ (A8:69)
A resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the relative
clause, e.g.
(33) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)
When the head nominal has the function of locative adverbial in the relative clause, it is occasionally resumed by the adverb tama, e.g.
(34) t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux d•ry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
(35) wíð5le ""a-dúk°a nišànqa,} ""a-dúk°a t-wéwa ""o-dídwa wíra tàma.} ‘He made
a sign in that place, the place where the fly had entered.’ (A11:10)
When the head nominal of a relative clause is a predicate in a clause with a
1st or 2nd person subject and the referent of the head nominal is the subject of the relative clause, the verb of the relative clause is inflected in
the 1st or 2nd person, in agreement with the subject of the main clause,
e.g.
(36) ""ána ""o-xà qáša} t-ín ""•°ya gu-ˇiyàre.} ‘I am that priest who came to
the ˇiyare.’ (B17:15)
(37) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} ‘You have not become

explicit syntactic marker, e.g.
(1) xáz6x máß6t t-amr•tli módin x•zya b-xêlmi.} ‘Let’s see whether you can tell
me what I saw in my dream.’ (A1:7)
(2) xàz6n} màß6n} t-óð6n xa-‘àra.} ‘I shall see whether I can find a solution.’
(A33:6)
In (3) the indirect question is negated:
(3) xáz6x lá-mß6t mam†•tla ""i°á°ux hátxa ©ðàðe?} ‘Let’s see whether you can
(literally: cannot) bring your hands together like this.’ (A28:15)
If the indirect question consists of two alternatives, these may be presented
asyndetically (4–5) or the second alternative may be introduced by the
conditional particle ""6n (6), e.g.
(4) ""o-m•ndi la-ðíle sùsa-wewa} náša-wewa l-xàße.} ‘He did not know whether that thing was a horse or whether there was a man on its back.’
(A29:21)
(5) ""áwwa táwr6t wála lán-ða""a módi ""•°ya bìye,} npíl5le b-""isàra,} ""awwa
xà-m6ndile qí°a bíye.} ‘I don’t know what has happened to that wild
ox, whether it has fallen on a rock or whether a thing such as that
has happened to him.’ (A12:52)
(6) l7la ðá""a módi bràya,} hadíya p7ša kèpa} ""•n la-p7ša kèpa.} ‘She did not know
what was happening, whether she would now turn to stone or not
turn to stone.’ (A8:73)
In (7) the conditional particle introduces a second indirect question that
is an expansion of the first rather than an alternative:
(7) l7ð6n b-x9y6n} ""6n-b-d7‰6n t-xazênn6x.} ‘I do not know whether I shall
live, whether I shall return and see you.’ (A8:56)
The alternative question may be reduced to the negative particle la (la""a).
This is introduced by lo or ""6n, resulting in the forms lo-la and ""6lla (<
""6n-la), e.g.","[1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014]"
"802chapter sixteen16.2.1. Adnominal Uses
16.2.1.1. Destination
The preposition l- is frequently used in the complement of a verb of
movement to express the destination, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)""áwwa qíma zíla l-bˆ°e díye.} ‘He went to his house.’ (A17:6)
""è°y5le l-bˆ°a.} ‘He came home.’ (A17:20)
si-dú‰ l-šòpux.} ‘Go back to your place.’ (A15:20)
ha-t-""á°e ""o-náša qamàya} má†e l-""ˆna} ""á°e xa-náša sàwa.} ‘Before the
first man reached the spring, an old man came.’ (A15:3)
dèqne díye m†áya l-9ra.} ‘His beard reached the ground.’ (A15:13)
t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?} ‘Shall we go up to this mountain?’ (A17:4)
masqánne l-bˆ°a.} ‘I shall take it up to the house.’ (A22:19)
°éla ßlèla} l-""árx6t be-Xàmmo.} ‘She came down to the water-mill of
the family of Xammo.’ (A19:1)
’úxo híwle bále l-bˆ°a.} ‘’uxo set off for home.’ (A7:12)In some cases the movement has a purposive sense, e.g.
(10) lá-""az6t l-q7se b-xáwl6t xàwrux.} ‘Do not go to (collect) wood with the
rope of your friend.’ (D2:71)
16.2.1.2. Direction
It may be used to express, broadly, the direction or objective of an action
without any clear movement towards the complement of the preposition
being invovled. It should be noted, however, that the relation of recipient
or beneficiary is normally expressed by the prepositions ta/†la- or qa- when
the complement is a nominal:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)ràbb6n} ""áwwa t-i-sàx6ð l-""álaha.} ‘A monk is somebody who worships
God.’ (A15:4)
dráya búxt6n l-xá l-d-o-xèna} ‘slandering this one and that one’
(A48:5)
dréla šláma l-f9qih.} ‘She greeted the jurist.’ (A22:16)
""álaha šuxa-l-šèmme ‘God—praise be to his name’ (A6:10)
""ána †líbt6nwa l-brón6t màmi.} ‘I was engaged to my cousin.’ (A13:14)the syntax of prepositions80316.2.1.3. ‘Upon, On’
In numerous cases l- has the sense of ‘upon’ or ‘on’, denoting a spatial
location above or, at least, on the surface of the referent that it governs.
The preposition in such cases is clearly derived from *'al:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)hóle tíwa l-kèpa.} ‘He is sitting on a stone.’ (A15:13)
bròn-málka tíw5le l-d-a-tàxta.} ‘The son of the king sat on the throne.’
(A14:43)
†ayènwale l-xàße.} ‘He would carry him on his back.’ (A17:18)
párxa ""átwa l-gàre.} ‘She flew up and sat on the roof.’ (A14:101)
klí°a l-márz6 d-a-j>zìra.} ‘It came to rest on the shore of the island.’
(A14:39)
máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle.} ‘He used to put polish on shoes.’ (A16:1)
míla l-hàlux!} ‘Blue on your condition! (= Confound you!)’ (A23:10)In certain contexts, where the verb involves movement, the preposition
has a sense of ‘onto’,
(8)
(9)sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘He went up onto the roof.’ (A25:52)
ta-d7rela l-xáß6t xmàre} ‘in order that he puts them onto the back of
his donkey’ (A23:13)
(10) mattíwala l-""9ra.} ‘They would put it onto the ground.’ (A12:3)
In constructions with the verb mxy used with the sense of ‘applying’ a
substance to something, the adnominal preposition l- may be used with
the item upon which the substance is applied (11) or a transposition may
take place as in (12), in which the preposition is placed on the nominal
expressing the substance:
(11) máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle.} ‘He used to put polish on shoes.’
(A16:1)
(12) ""u-mèxy6x6lla má°6n kúlla l-míla-w l-kóma m-bá°re dìye.} ‘and we have
covered all our village with blue and black after him (= after his
departure).’ (A4:32)
In some cases where the preposition l- corresponds to *'al in earlier Aramaic it has the sense of ‘concerning, about’, e.g.
(13) mbaqóre l-d-ò-naša:} ""ìtle bróna?} ‘He was inquiring concerning the
man: Has he a son?’ (A8:5)804chapter sixteen16.2.1.4. General Spatial Location
In some cases it denotes a static spatial location without any implication
of being ‘above’ in a higher position, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
(9)hóle ""àrya} l-àyya góta} ""u-""êzza} hóla l-àyya góta.} ‘There is a lion on this
side and a she-goat on the other side.’ (A24:15)
""u-xmáre l-gòte-diye} ‘with his ass at his side’ (A7:6)
l-a-pá°a xét6t nèra} ""í° xa-má°6t huðàye.} ‘On the other side of the river
there is a village of Jews.’ (A14:50)
""u-xètna l-b7°a pˆšena.} ‘and I shall become a son-in-law in the house.’
(A17:35)
šqúl ""áwwa q7sa l-""ìðux.} ‘Take this stick in your hand.’ (A22:26)
""aw-l-˙àmmam sáxe.} ‘He washes in the bathroom.’ (A21:17)
hóla spára l-kàwe.} ‘They are waiting at the window.’ (A4:59)
""u-qáre l-t9ra.} ‘and he calls at the door.’ (A6:5)
""u-šawqíwale l-šêmša.} ‘and they would leave it in the sun.’ (B7:20)We could include here the adverbial laxxa ‘here’, which has been formed
from l- + ""axxa and may be used to denote static location. The l- that
is often used with the particle of isolation xoð- (§14.6.) also falls in this
category, e.g.
(10) pìšela} har-""àni-tre l-xoðéy.} ‘Only those two remained by themselves.’
(A20:9)
16.2.1.5. Expression of the Agent
An adnominal l- is sporadically used to express the agent in constructions
with resultative participles (cf. §15.9.2.–3.), e.g.
(1)šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwa.} ‘The seven of them have been eaten by
wolves.’ (A23:15)
(2) ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka
bt-áz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)
(3) xá°ux Nasímo jlíwt5la l-""arabàye.} ‘Your sister Nasimo has been kidnapped by Arabs.’ (A37:5)
(4) ""u-Dùre} píšt5la muqyàmta} muxràwta} šawwà gáye} l-xànpe} qa†òle}
t-muš6lmàne.} ‘Dure was evacuated and destroyed seven times by
pagan murderers of Muslims.’ (B2:2)the syntax of prepositions805(5) ""u-síq5le gu-d-ó sàrga} mtúrßa l-an-jaqsìye} t-mðìta.} ‘He went up onto the
saddle, which was made by the town craftsmen.’ (A8:52)
16.2.1.6. Manner
The use of the preposition l- in adverbials of manner is restricted to
numerical expressions such as (1):
(1) píšela mnáy6lla l-xà-xa.} ‘They began counting them one by one.’
(A6:3)
16.2.1.7. Complement of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition l- occurs as a complement to various verbs and expressions, e.g. dmaya l- ‘to resemble’, masloye l- ‘to despise’, maßyo°e l- ‘to listen
to’, mhaymone l- ‘to believe in’, mqahore l- ‘to grieve for’, qrawa l-, mqarobe
l- ‘to approach’, mraxome l- ‘to pity’, mßawore l- ‘to curse’, mxaya l- ‘to hit,
knock’, n†ara l- ‘to watch’, †>ya l- ‘to search for’.
16.2.1.8. Combined with other Prepositions
The preposition l- may be combined with other prepositions. After verbs
of movement, for example, it may be combined with k6s-, e.g.
(1) ""o-gáya q9m5°a °élux l-kèsli} ‘the first time you came to me’ (A1:22)
16.2.2. Adpronominal Uses
16.2.2.1. L-suffixes
The L-suffixes exhibit only a very restricted degree of functional overlap
with the adnominal uses of l-. The most common uses of the L-suffixes
include the expression of the subject of verb forms derived from the past
base (q†ille, q†ilwale) and the expression of the direct and indirect object
of transitive verbs.
The use of the L-suffixes to express the subject in forms such as q†ille
originated historically as a marking of the agent in a passive construction
(< q†il ‘He was killed’ + le ‘by him’). We have seen above that adnominal
l- is still used to mark the agent of a passive. The L-suffixes have, however,
been extended to the marking of the subject of past base intransitive
verbs, where they clearly do not mark an agent. This can be explained as
a result of the suffixes being reinterpreted as markers of the grammatical
subject of the verb rather than markers of the agent.","[840, 841, 842, 843, 844]"
"the syntax of verbs581(13) hon-zála réš6 d-ò gèšra,} ""ína ràba zdá""a} t-là-napl6n gu-d-a-yáma.} ‘I went
over the bridge, fearing greatly that I would fall into the sea
(= wishing that I would not fall).’ (A11:7)
The qa†6l form occurs in complements of expressions of obligation consisting of the impersonal forms g>r6g, laz6m, b>ye (‘it is necessary’), the
former of these being the most common one. The complement clause is
not introduced by the particle D, e.g.
(14) g8r6g ""àmr6x.} ‘We must say.’ (A4:38)
(15) g8r6g ""à°6t.} ‘You must come.’ (A7:9)
(16) g8r6g ""ázi b6°-be-xêtna.} ‘They must go to the house of the groom.’
(B5:36)
(17) g8r6g rába ""áxl6t xàm.} ‘You have to be very careful.’ (B5:105)
(18) bèl-šèdla l-šêdla} g8r6g mátteti xa-xamšá ""aqlà°a.} ‘Between the saplings
you must leave about five steps.’ (B5:103)
(19) láz6m ""axlênne.} ‘I must eat him.’ (A47:5)
(20) hadíya b8ye mpal†êtle.} ‘Now you must take him out.’ (A26:77)
The negative particle is placed before the verb in the complement clause,
e.g.
(21) g8r6g là-""amr6t hátxa.} ‘You must not say that.’ (A18:10)
The qa†6l form occurs in complements of the verb mßy ‘to be able’ and
also of various other expressions denoting possibility (or lack of it). The
particle D is used in these constructions, though not consistently, e.g.
(22) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)
(23) máß6x ""àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B15:16)
(24) máßi m†àli gáwa.} ‘They can play in it.’ (B11:30)
(25) har-là-mß6n t-amrènnux.} ‘I just cannot tell you.’ (A11:2)
(26) ""áp-xa l7le mßáya ""5-š8r6† t-awêdla.} ‘Nobody can fulfil the condition.’
(A25:70)
(27) ""ána bi-zóda m-hód6x là-maß6n ""oðènnux} ‘ù m6ndí.} ‘I cannot do anything
more for you than that.’ (A8:44)
(28) láx mßáya ""áz6x ""amrêxla.} ‘We cannot go and tell her.’ (A4:39)
(29) le-y-bárya ""áyya ""o-šúla ""oðêxle.} ‘It is not possible for us to do this
thing.’ (A8:10)
(30) lá-hoya yóma qamáya xètna t-xazéla k yàlo.} ‘On the first day it is not
possible for the groom to see the bride.’ (A4:36)582chapter fifteen15.1.1.9. Irrealis Clauses Introduced by Prepositions
The qa†6l form is sometimes used in a clause introduced by the prepositional phrases qam ‘before’, ha-t, hal ""5-g6t, ta ‘until’ or t-la ‘without’, which
refer to an event that has not yet taken place from the perspective of the
verb in the main clause, e.g.
(1) qam-t-à°i} mpál6†le m6n-hàbsa.} ‘Before they return, release him from
prison.’ (A26:72)
(2) qám t-qáre ""ax-dìga,} šáql6t m6n-d-ó ""ixàla.} ‘Before it calls out like a cock,
take some of the food.’ (A24:16)
(3) qam-má†e šéta ""úmre dìye,} ""i-nablíle l-""ùmra.} ‘Before he reaches a year
in age, they take him to the church.’ (B6:35)
(4) wúr gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a,} óúmle t8ra bàrux} . . . ha-t-gáw‰i ""àz6l.} ‘Go into this
room and close the door behind you . . . until my husband goes.’
(A22:26)
(5) ya-""àlaha,} háwe ßáxi hál-""5-g6t ""ána má†y6n ""èlle dìye.} ‘Oh God, let him
be well until I reach him.’ (A26:80)
(6) mèra d6-klìg6n!} pàl†6n m-gáwe.} mère là} ta-t-óð6n qáp6x ""àp †la-réš6x,} ba'd∞n
pàl†6t.} ‘She said “Stop! I (want to) get out of it.” He said “No,
not until I make a lid also for your head, then you come out.” ’
(A20:3)
(7) ""u-màsta} ""áxl6t mènna qrúšta díya t-la-xàrwa.} ‘You should eat the yoghurt
without the crust being spoilt.’ (A30:5)
(8) Qa†ina x6tn5le t-la-mbarxile. ‘Qa†ina is a groom without being wed.’
(A50:15)
15.1.1.10. Purpose Clauses (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in clauses expressing purpose. These clauses are
sometimes introduced simply by the particle D. In many cases, however,
this is combined with the particles qa or ta, e.g.
(1) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you so that
you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)
(2) ""áti qam-""7n6 d-ánna botanàye} mšád6rra t-ázi m7°i xàrje.} ‘Before the eyes
of these people of Botan, send them in order to go and collect
taxes.’ (A26:72)
(3) xon>wá°i mv8do mv9do} t-la-""azítu b-míya ""ap-àxtu.} ‘My brothers, move
out of the way so that you do not go with the water (i.e. so that
you are not carried away by the water).’ (A39:12)the syntax of verbs583(4)xán‘i t-amrènna qalùlta} qa-t-pàrqa.} ‘I’ll tell it to you quite quickly so
that it will finish.’ (A4:5)
(5) ßráx5le qa-t-š9ma} brát6t màlka.} ‘He is shouting so that the daughter
of the king hears.’ (A21:16)
(6) d5rètla sùla lí°6n} qá-t šéta b-šéta biš-mq>rèna tàza.} ‘You put manure
on it, you see, in order that from year to year it grows better.’
(B5:105)
(7) mšaxnánne ""ixàla} ta-t-áxl6x ""ána-w ""áti m-©ðàðe.} ‘I shall heat the food
so that you and I may eat together.’ (A22:31)
(8) m†amrètle spáy ta-t-là dáy6‰.} ‘Bury him well so that he does not
return.’ (A22:37)
(9) ""áwwa †éni páy6š n†ìra} ta-t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘This saddle bag
will be guarded so that nothing will happen to it.’ (A7:9)
(10) la q7m6n jàlde} ta-t-óð6n p6lxàna} †la-gàni} ta-t-àxl6n?} ‘Should I not get
up early to work for myself, so that I can eat?’ (A21:19)
Occasionally the D particle is elided before the initial consonant of class
B verbs, e.g.
(11) b>yánna bìya} b-sùsa} b-ráš6n diyéy kùlla,} ta-ßály6n ma°yànne.} ‘I want
them all with their horse and rations, in order for me to go down
to bring him back.’ (A25:75)
(12) táxt5la mútte hàtxa} ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They have put a board like this in
order to go down there.’ (A22:10)
15.1.1.11. After Particle of Imminent Future gaThe element ga-, most likely in origin the noun gaya ‘time, instance’, takes
a verb in the qa†6l form introduced by the subordinator D as its complement to express the imminent future (‘is about to . . .’), e.g.
(1)ga-t-à°6n.} ‘I am about to come.’The subordinator D is often elided before consonants:
(2)
(3)ga-t-pàrq6n} ~ ga-pàrq6n.} ‘I am about to finish.’
ga-t-mà†6x} ~ ga-mà†6x.} ‘We are about to arrive.’The construction is attested in the text corpus in (4):
(4)""è°y5la ""àrye.} ""ê°ye,} ""ê°ye,} š-l7wa mè†ye ""6lle-dìye,} há há ga-má†ya t-axlàle,}
dèry6lla bòóe.} dèry6lla bòóe,} qíme tre-xùre.} ‘The lions came. They came,584chapter fifteen
but they had not yet reached him. “Hah, hah” she is about to eat
him. So, he cast the seeds. When he cast the seeds, two willow trees
grew up.’ (A18:26)15.1.1.12. Generic Relative Clauses
The qa†6l form is used in a relative clause that has a non-specific antecedent rather than one referring to a specific referent, e.g.
(1) ""alpá-dáwe b6d-yáw6l †la-kút ""amèrre mòdile xèlme.} ‘I shall give a thousand
gold pieces to whomsoever tells me what my dream is.’ (A1:12)
(2) kút ""ás6q qamáya xazéla ""5-dalí°a brì°6ll-ani} parêmla.} ‘The first one who
goes up and sees the vine growing on those (trees) cuts it down.’
(A26:91)
(3) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
she goes to and enters, the other has to follow after her.’ (B12:2)
(4) ""an-t-óði koðênta,} t-awéle tùna.} ‘Those who keep (literally: do) mules
have hay.’ (B5:108)
15.1.1.13. In Subordinate Clauses with Past Time Reference
On numerous occasions, the qa†6l form is used in subordinate clauses in
the contexts described above also when the main clause contains a past
form verb. Such qa†6l forms have past time reference, with their deictic
centre in the tense of the main clause, e.g.
(1) ""u-b>yéwa palè†-u plì†le.} ‘He wanted to come out and he did come
out.’ (A22:45)
(2) ßêly5le} ta-t-""áz6l ""ùrxa.} ‘He went down to set off on the road.’
(A15:5)
(3) ""u-t8ra óím6lle ta-t-lá-""aw6r ""áp-xa náša gàwa.} ‘They closed the door so
that nobody would go into it.’ (A23:24)
(4) qímt5la šqílt5la xa-bròna} ""u-nobàlt6lle} ta-t-axlàle.} ‘She got up and
took a son (of hers) and took him in order for her to eat him.’
(A19:3)
(5) ""u-síqle ta-t-áx6l mêndi.} ‘He went up to eat something.’ (A21:8)
(6) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre,} qam-maqimìl6n.} ‘That was the
last girl to be buried in Dure before they evacuated us.’ (B1:12)
(7) ""u-zílela ha-t-ázi má†i l-""á°‰6t . . . d-áw . . . báb6 d-a-bràta.} ‘They travelled
until they reached the land of the girl’s father.’ (A29:36)the syntax of verbs58515.1.2. qa†6lwa
The qa†6lwa form, with the past verbal affix -wa, always has past time
reference. It has both realis and irrealis functions.
15.1.2.1. Narrative Past (Realis)
In a few cases the qa†6lwa form is used in narrative perfectively to express
an event in the past. The clauses in which it occurs can be interpreted as
having a background function, preliminary to an ensuing foreground section of the narrative. In (1), for example, the event of the woman going to
church and her kidnap by Arab horsemen is part of the preliminary section
of the narrative, which sets the scene for the following foregrounded events.
In (2) the event of the baby Leli°a going out to eat a child is presented as
the setting for the following foregrounded scene in which the people of
the village come to the king in panic. In (3) the main prominence in the
speaker’s narration of events is on the reaction of the other man to the
speaker’s blows, the act of the speaker striking him being preliminary to
this. Similarly in (4) the main prominence is given to the event resulting
form the Leli°a’s biting of the man’s leg:
(1) ""azáwa ""úmra qa-t-qarwàwa,} dášta áa¬yáwa rakáwe ""arabàye.} ‘She went
to church to take communion and the plain filled with Arab horsemen.’ (A37:2)
(2) gu-dargúšta q5màwa,} šaryáwa b>núda dìya} ""u-""azáwa gu-mà°a,} ""axláwa
xa-bròna,} ""a°yàwa,} damxàwa.} ""áp-xa lè-y-y>ðewa bíya díya.} y-a°7wa škáya
qa-màlka.} málka t-áw6t basìma,} ""áyya mut-má°5la?} ""ánna mut-˙àrs-it mattóye?} bróni hóle xíla ""6dlˆle,} gu-dargúšta dmìxa.} ‘She (the baby Leli°a)
stood up in the cradle, untied her bands, went into the village, ate
a child, then came back and went to sleep. Nobody knew about
her. They came (repeatedly) to complain to the king. “King, may
you be healthy, what kind of village is this? What kind of guard
are you appointing? My son was eaten tonight while asleep in his
cradle.” ’ (A18:1)
(3) maxènwale s7pa gu-xàße.} yáha mère mù-mxelux gu-xáßi.} tabzìya qítla bíyux.}
maxènwale rúmxi ""èlle dìye} mù-qítle bíyi?} ‘I struck a sword on his back
and he said “What did you strike on my back”, (I said) “A rosary
has hit you”. I struck my spear into him (and he said) “What has
hit me?” ’ (A12:20)
(4) xá-""aqle ""axlàwale,} qè†ma kúlle ßléle gu-pá°a dìya.} ‘She (the Leli°a) bit (literally: ate) one of his legs and the ash all fell into her face.’ (A18:23)586chapter fifteenThis perfective narrative use of the qa†6lwa form can be regarded as standing in a relationship to the narrative qa†6l form (§15.1.1.1.) that is similar
to the relationship of q†ilwale to q†ille in narrative (§15.2.2.). In both cases
the form of the pair with the explicit marking of the past with the -wa
particle denotes a prior event that is off the line of the main narrative
foreground. Although the form qa†6lwa when used in this function may in
some cases be felicitously translated by the English pluperfect (e.g. ‘She
had gone to church . . .) , it is important to note that it expresses an event
and not a resultant state. Any resultant state is only an implicature not a
component of its meaning. When the speaker wishes to express a resultant state directly, the compound construction consisting of the resultative
participle and the past copula is used (§15.4.1.).
15.1.2.2. Past Habitual (Realis)
The qa†6lwa form is occasionally used with class A verbs to refer to habitual
actions in the past, expressing an imperfective aspect in the past indicative,
though in the majority of cases the past habitual of this class of verb is
expressed by the ""i-qa†6lwa form with the ""i- prefix. Examples from the text
corpus in main and subordinate clauses include the following:
(1) kút-yum ""azáwa l-†úra ma°yáwa ða-k7rt6 q7sa l-xáßa dìya.} ‘Everyday she
would go to the mountains and bring a bundle of wood on her
back.’ (A10:6)
(2) tÆtun-≥ig6n} z>rìwala} ""ánna xaqlà°a} z>ríwala kùlla.} ""awðíwala zrùta.}
‘They would cultivate tobacco. They would plough all the fields
and make them into ploughed land.’ (B7:10)
(3) ""as‰íwala dàsta.} ‘They would bind it (the tobacco) in bundles.’
(B7:16)
(4) m6n-""6mmày6t šènne} duxrán6t Mar-Sáw6t ""oðìwale} ""íwa t6ltáss6r b-""êóóa.} ‘For
hundreds of years the memorial of Saint Sawa which they observed
was on the thirteenth of September.’ (B15:92)
(5) ""ína bušála t-""oðèxwala †làl6n,} xán‘i miyànta,} la-ràba.} ‘But the stew,
which we made for ourselves, was somewhat watery, though not
too much.’ (B10:17)
(6) ""im6t-""a°íwa barzanáye kêsle,} y-ám6r . . . ‘When the people of Barzan
came to him, he would said . . .’ (B19:1)the syntax of verbs587In class B verbs the qa†6lwa form without the prefix is very frequently used
to express past habitual action, e.g.
(7)bašlíwa rêzza.} bašlíwa šòrba.} ‘They would cook rice. They would
cook soup.’ (B7:3)
(8) q5míwa m†alìwa,} raqðìwa,} zamrìwa.} ‘They would get up and play,
dance and sing.’ (B7:4)
(9) ""an-šêdle} šalxìwala m6n-táma} max7wala gu-m6ššàra.} ‘They would uproot
the seedlings from that place and plant them in the paddy field.’
(B7:11)
(10) béna halbát m5°7wa štˆ°a-w,} yá'ni ""9raq,} ""u-m-xàmra-w} zamrìwa-w}
xamlìwa.} ‘Then they would, of course, bring drink, arak together
with wine, and they would sing and enjoy themselves.’ (B5:62)
(11) kút-xa šáq6lwa xákma x6zmàn-dìye,} masèqla k6sle-díye †la-f†àrta.} ‘Each
person would take some of his relatives and take them up to his
home for breakfast.’ (B5:60)
The form may be used also to express iterative action that took place over
a short interval of time, e.g.
(12) mère ""ána b8y6n S6ttìye.} ""áy biš-šapìrt5la S6ttíye} ""u-d5réwa képe hátxa biyˆni.}
‘He said “I love S6ttiye. S6ttiye is the most beautiful” and threw
stones (repeatedly) at us.’ (A25:20)
(13) xà-gaya,} daríwa xà-f6lsa.} ""5néy yawíwala l-†ùra} ""u-xaßéy ""6l-gàrra.} ‘On
one occcasion they were throwing a coin (repeatedly). They turned
their eyes to the mountain and their backs to the pool.’ (B15:33)
15.1.2.3. Continuous Situation in the Past
We have seen in §15.1.1.4. that a small set of verbs denoting mental
processes or states are used in the qa†6l form to express a situation that
holds in the actual present but is not necessarily a habitual property of
the subject. When such verbs are used in the qa†6lwa form, they may
denote, accordingly, a continuous situation at a particular period in the
past rather than a habitual property of the subject, e.g.
(1)
(2)
(3)""u-b>yéwa palè†-u plì†le.} ‘He wanted to come out and he came out’
(A22:45)
""ap-q†ála b>yènwa qa†lênwale.} ‘I even wanted to to kill him.’ (A1:17)
""áyya ’6lk8ze B8dal Sahàre} y>ðàwa} ""áwwa hóle °àya.} ‘This ’6lk>ze
B>dal Sahare knew that he was coming.’ (A12:33)588chapter fifteenThe qa†6lwa form is used with these verbs also to express a habitual situation, e.g.
(4) ""u-mdi b>yêxwa} zaqrèxwa ""àxni.} ‘Whatever we wanted we used to knit.’
(B10:46)
(5) y>ðíwa mo-qádra d5rˆwa.} ‘They knew how much (soil) to put on.’
(B5:191)
15.1.2.4. Conditional Constructions
The qa†6lwa form is used in the protasis of conditional constructions.
These may refer to real iterative situations in the past (1–3). Alternatively,
the qa†6lwa form may be used to refer to a hypothetical condition in the
past, which was not fulfilled, or to a hypothetical condition in the present or future, which the speaker assesses to be impossible to fulfil (4–6).
Such hypothetical conditions refer to a single event or an iterative event.
The verb can be interpreted as expressing perfective aspect, presenting
the action as an event delimited by a start and end point, or at least with
a start point. In the case of iterative actions, the speaker uses the form
that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence of
the iterated situation. Verbs expressing mental processes and states such
as by ‘to want’ in (3) are exceptions. In main clauses the qa†6lwa form of
these verbs are used imperfectively to express a continous situation in the
past and this applies also to their usage in the syntactic context under
discussion here. Examples:
(1) ""u-""6n-xà‘‘a} xá‘‘a xa-béna ""aryàwa-dunye} d5r7wa xá‘‘a tùna,} biš-dawùqwa.}
‘If it rained, they put down a little straw, so that it was more compact.’ (B5:146)
(2) ""6n-parèqwa ""Èšwu†,} ""áw ""6srí-tmanya yomá°a yan-""6srí-""6óóa yomàn5le,}
y-azèxwa †ùra.} ‘If February was finished—it is twenty-eight or twentynine days long—we would go to the mountains.’ (B5:152)
(3) ""6n-b>yèxwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6n-ile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
(4) ""6n-maxéwala xa-xéna xa°màwa} t-axlàwale.} ‘If he had hit another (blow),
she would have healed and eaten him.’ (A50:14)
(5) ""6n-maßéwa t-axêlwala,} lˆla xamúße.} ‘If he could have eaten them, (he
would not have said that) they were sour.’ (A43:4)
(6) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa.} ‘If I could, I would come.’the syntax of verbs589Note the usage of the qa†6lwa form to refer to a hypothetical perfective
event in the past that did not actually take place in contexts such as (7)–(10)
or a hypothetical condition in the future, which the speaker assesses to be
unlikely to take place (11)–(12):
(7)""ó-yom6t gorànwa,} ""è°y5le ""áwwa 'afr≈t gnìw6lli.} ‘The day I would have
got married, this demon came and stole me away.’ (A13:14)
(8) ""ap-""àti} m-g¶b t-a°ètwa m7°6twali zùze,} šqíllux xa-š6ndòxa.} ‘So you,
instead of coming and bringing me money, took a rock.’ (A1:25)
(9) m-7ka †>yênwalux ""ána?} ‘From where could I have sought this for
you?’ (A30:23)
(10) †úwe t-xazênwale!} ‘If only I had seen him!’
(11) bas-xá°i Nozáli xazênwala.} ‘If only I could see my sister Nozali.’
(A8:57)
(12) p5š6nwa mevan diya. ‘(If only) I could become her guest.’ (C2:1)
15.1.2.5. Other Subordinate Clauses
The qa†6lwa form is used in the various other types of subordinate clauses
that the qa†6l form is used in. It has past tense reference and is dependent,
in principle, on a past verb, which may express perfective or imperfective
aspect, e.g.
(1) b>yéwa palê†wa.} ‘He wanted to come out.’ (A22:45)
(2) lá-qab6lwa ""áxni saxêxwa.} ‘He did not allow us to swim.’ (A25:20)
(3) lé y-šawqíwa m†àl6nwa m6nnéy.} ‘They did not let me play with them.’
(B15:33)
(4) ràq6nwa} ta-t-mbašlánwa-w qítli bìyux.} ‘I was running in order to cook
and I knocked into you.’ (A27:42)
(5) p5rmèxwala qá-t ""5-qálya mbarzêxwale.} ‘We would slaughter them in
order to dry the fat tail.’ (B5:139)
(6) qam-t-asèqwa mère †la-bnà°e.} ‘Before he went up he said to his daughters . . .’ (A26:85)
(7) ""i-p5šíwa yá'ni t-la ma†íwa ""7k5le b5°èy.} ‘Only a few of them remained
without arriving at (the place) where their house was.’ (B15:44)
On some sporadic occasions the qa†6lwa form is used in a subordinate
clause that is dependent on a main clause containing a qa†6l form. In such
cases the qa†6l form of the main has past time reference. This is attested
in constructions with the verbs by ‘to want’ and mßy ‘to be able’ in the
main clause, e.g.","[619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628]"
"Unspecified plural: alpaye.
12.1.6. Combination of Numerals
Cardinals are combined by the conjunction w in descending order, e.g.
álpa-w 6štà-mma š•nne ‘one thousand six-hundred years’ (B1:7), •šti-w xàmša
šére ‘sixty-five poems’ (B1:15), •mma-w xamšì-f6lse ‘a hundred and fifty fils’
(B1:20), álpa-w 6óóá-mma-w •šti-w tré ‘1962’.
12.1.7. Cardinals with Pronominal Suffixes
Distinct forms of the cardinals 2-10 are used when they are combined
with a pronominal suffix. There are two alternative forms for the numeral
‘2’ in these constructions:
2 t6rw•°n6n
t6rw6°n7xu
t6rw6°néy‘the two of us’
‘the two of you’
‘the two of them’trá°n6n
tra°n7xu

‘the nine of you’
‘the nine of them’106 ra°n6n
6 ra°n7xu
6 ra°néy‘the ten of us’
‘the ten of you’
‘the ten of them’In these constructions the stress is often moved forwards to the place
it occupies in the isolated form of the numeral, e.g. árba°n6n (cf. árba),
xámša°n6n (cf. xámša), etc.
12.2. Ordinals
A distinct ordinal form is used for ‘first’, viz. qamáya, fs. qam7°a, pl. qamáye.
The remaining ordinals are expressed by combining the cardinal with
the genitive particle D. The cardinals 2–10 have the appropriate form in
accordance with the gender of the noun:
1st
2nd
3rd
4th
5th
6th

t-tmánya

inconsistently. There is a tendency to generalize the use the masculine
forms after all nouns. The genitive particle is usually bonded with the
preceding noun.
Examples: úrza qamáya ‘the first man’, báxta qam7°a ‘the first woman’,
árxe qamáye ‘the first guests’, úrz6t tré ‘the second man’, báxt6t t•rte ~ báxt6t
tré ‘the second woman’, árx6t tré ‘the second guest’; úrz6t ŀá°a ‘the third
man’, báxt6t •ŀŀ6° ~ báxt6t ŀá°a ‘the third woman’, árx6t ŀá°a ‘the third
guest’, etc.
Ordinals from 11th onwards are, likewise, expressed by the particle D
and the appropriate cardinal:
11th
12th
13tht-xad•ss6r
t-tr•ss6r
t-t6ltáss6r, etc.
12.3. FractionsThe words for ‘half ’ and ‘quarter’ are as follows:
‘half ’
‘quarter’pálga
čár6kConstructions such as ‘one and a half ’, ‘two and a half ’ etc. are formed
by attaching the 3ms. suffix -e to the word palga thus: xa-w palge, tre-w palge
(Literally: ‘one and its half ’, ‘two and its half ’). Although in origin the
3ms. pronoun, the ending -e has become fossilized in this context and is
used also when the preceding item is feminine, e.g. xa-kista-w palge ‘one
and a half bags’.
The word čár6k is a loan from Kurdish. It is usually given an Arabic
plural pattern, e.g. ŀá°a čăwár6k ‘three quarters’.
Other fractions may be expressed by the structure xa m6n + cardinal,
e.g. xá m6n- ŀá ‘a third’, xá m6n-xámša ‘a fifth’.","[464, 465, 466]"
"522chapter fourteenA restrictive appositive, which picks out one member of a set, is not
normally fronted in this way before a singular noun. It can only be annexed
to a plural noun referring to all members of the set, e.g.
(71) ""o-go‰6t xon>wa°a ‘the elder of the brothers’
Exceptions to this are attested with the ordinal adjectives qamaya ‘first’
and xaraya ‘last’, e.g.
(72) w-áti °èl6x,} ""a-qamˆ°a báxta °él6x.} ‘Now, you have come. You are the
first woman to come (literally: You have come, the first woman).’
(A8:79)
(73) ""6srì ""otáxe} hòla} óìme.} ""áni pa°xêtla.} ""an-t-íla p°ìxe} ""aómêtla.} má†6t
""5-xar7°6t ""òt6x.} ‘Twenty rooms are closed. You should open these.
Close the ones that are open. You will reach the last room.’
(A24:16)
The plural adjectives priše ‘various, different’ and rabe ‘great, abundant’
may be placed before or after the head noun. Their semantic range is
more restrictive when they come before the noun, in that in this position
they can only have a quantifying sense:
priše m6ndiyane
m6ndiyane priše‘various things’
‘different/various things’rabe m6ndiyane
m6ndiyane rabe‘many things’
‘great/many things’An adjective may be combined with further material that is dependent
on it. This may take the form of a prepositional phrase, e.g. gò‰e b-šènne
‘old in years’ (B15:62). In some cases the adjective is combined with the
dependent item in a nominal annexation construction, e.g.
(74) ""áyya dúk°e díye . . . qí°t6t kèpe.} ‘This place on him was wounded by
the stones.’ (B9:25)
Such constructions often exhibit tightly-knit asyndetic annexation, e.g.
kōm-pa°a ‘black-faced, disgraceful’, xwār-pa°a ‘white-faced, innocent’, xwār
d6qna ‘white bearded = senior’, p°īx ""5na ‘open-eyed’ (in the expression
mi°a p°īx ""5ne ‘dead with his eyes open’), prī†-dína ‘destroyed of religion =the syntax of nominals523irreligious’ (A30:28), prī†-baba ‘destroyed of father = bastard’ (C7:11), xrīwdiyára ‘destroyed of houses = accursed scoundrel’ (A30:24).
Note the constructions ""6rb6t xware ‘white sheep’ and ""6rb6t kome ‘black
sheep (goats)’. Here a noun is annexed to a plural adjective. The noun
may be singular or plural in number, e.g. xa ""6rb6t xware ‘a white sheep’,
raba ""6rb6t xware ‘many white sheep’. These phrases express the affiliation
of the sheep to a generic class that share the property of being ‘white’ or
‘black’ respectively, rather than expressing a property that is peculiar to one
particular sheep or group of sheep. A similar construction is x6††6t romaye
‘roman wheat, maize’, properly ‘wheat of (the class of ) roman (wheat)’.
An adjective stands without a head when it occurs in an ascriptive
predicate with the verb ‘to be’, which assigns a property to the subject
of the predication, or in a predicate containing copula-like verbs such as
pyš ‘to become, remain’, e.g.
(75) gilándi rába gò‰5le.} ‘A scythe is very big.’ (B5:143)
(76) y-áwa hátxa zòre.} ‘They are small like this.’ (B6:52)
(77) maštˆwala} qá-t xá‘‘a p7šawa rakìxta.} ‘They would irrigate it so that
it would become rather soft.’ (B5:76)
As indicated in (§11.6.), some words of Aramaic stock that function like
adjectives remain uninflected for gender and number. In some cases the
explanation for this is that they are in origin adverbial expressions whose
use has been extended to attributive positions. This applies, for example,
to the words qurba ‘near’ and r6˙qa ‘far’, which are used as invariable
attributes modifying nouns, e.g.
b5°a qurba/r6˙qa
ma°a qurba/r6˙qa
ma°wa°a qurba/r6˙qa‘a nearby/distant house’
‘a nearby/distant village’
‘nearby/distant villages’These words are nouns that are used in other contexts in adverbial phrases,
modifying verbs. They may be accompanied by a preposition (78–79) or
used without one (80–81)
(78) xá-bena xzéle m-rè˙qa xá-mdi xwàra.} ‘He suddenly saw from afar
something white.’ (A14:28)
(79) mè†yela l-qùrb6t b7°a.} mè†yela l-qúrb6t qáßr6t màlka.} ‘They came near
to home. They came near to the palace of the king.’ (A24:24)
(80) m†í°5la qúrb6t qàßra.} ‘He came close to the palace.’ (A27:31)524chapter fourteen(81) qímt5la šqílt5la xa-bròna} ""u-nobàlt6lle} ta-t-axlàle.} mutt7°6lle rê˙qa} m6nmà°a.} ‘She got up and took a son (of hers) and took him for her
to eat. She put him down far away from the village.’ (A19:3)
They occur in the predicate of clauses containing the verb ‘to be’,
where they were originally locative predicates, but evidently came to be
re-interpreted as attributes, e.g.
(82) rê˙q5le qáßra.} ‘The palace is in the distance [locative]’ > ‘The palace
is far [attribute].’ (A24:48)
(83) kúlla náše díye t-w7wa qùrba.} ‘All his relatives who were in the vicinity
[locative]’ > ‘All his relatives who were near [attribute].’ (B8:38)
Due to their being re-interpreted as attributes in predicative position, they
could then be used as attributives of nouns in a nominal phrase, e.g. qaßra
r6˙qa ‘a distant palace’, b5°a qurba ‘a near-by house’, etc.
An attributive adjective is sometimes separated from its head noun by
intervening material. The purpose of this is generally to give the adjective
prominence by placing it in the default position of the nuclear stress at
the end of the intonation group, e.g.
(84) †>†íye y-oðèxwa gò‰e.} ‘We made big rugs.’ (B10:79)
(85) bálk6t qám°a ""í°wa núne gáwa díya gò‰e.} ‘Perhaps formerly there were
large fish in it.’ (B3:11)
(86) b-álaha hóle xa-púrya láxxa zòra.} ‘By God there is a small light here.’
(A14:25)
(87) ""ína ðá qotíya hátxa zòra.} ‘Behold a box, small like this.’ (A12:51)
(88) píš5le màjbur} hà-t-ile} ríxa ""è°ya mènne díye spìsa.} ‘He remained like
that, of necessity, until a rotten smell came from him.’ (A27:43)
(89) ""u-xá kèxwa gu-be-""7ne díye kòma} ‘with a black star on its forehead’
(A8:62)
(90) ""ánna zmaryà°6x} m-7k6t lípt6lla hátxa basìme?} ‘Where did you learn
those songs of yours, which are so beautiful?’ (A35:8)
When the adjective is given contrastive focal prominence, it is sometimes
placed at the front of the clause, e.g.
(91)""áy xwàra} m†albále sùsa.} ‘She requests a white horse (whereas her
brother requested a black one).’ (A8:62)the syntax of nominals525In some contexts an adjective without a head should be interpreted as
the predicate of a reduced adverbial clause. This applies to cases such
as the following:
(92)yèmmi zòrta mítla.} ‘My mother died (when she was) young.’
(B8:14)
(93) d6qnáy g>réwale bríza m-àxxa.} ‘He would shave their beard (while
it was) dry from here.’ (A11:14)
(94) ßléla xaššàne l-b7°a.} ‘They went down to their home (while they
were) sad.’ (A14:20)
(95) ""u-qím5le màlka} xêðya} gu-gàne-w} ‘The king left, (while he was)
cheerful in spirits.’ (A21:30)
(96) ""áy hár mšeyðòne} šwára nðáya gu-d-án ""otáxe šluxˆ°a.} ‘She (the princess)
is continually acting madly, leaping and jumping around (while
she was) naked in the rooms.’ (A4:17)
(97) koðènta b-ìðiyawa} šulxˆ°a.} ‘The mule was in my hand, (while it
was) bare-backed.’ (B5:130)
(98) dráya képe ""áxni sxàya} šluxayà°a.} ‘He threw stones when we were
swimming (while we were) nude.’ (A25:20)
(99) q6m-qabèlle šláme tíwa l-""9ra.} ‘He received his greetings (while he
was) seated on the ground.’ (A26:47)
(100) S6ttíye tu-láxxa xarˆ°a.} ‘S6ttiye, sit here (while being) the last (i.e.
in the last place).’ (A25:16)
(101) xán‘i t-amrènna qalùlta} qa-t-pàrqa.} ‘I’ll tell it (the story) to you
quickly (= it being quick) so that it will finish.’ (A4:5)
Resultative participles of verbs with atelic actionality in some contexts
appear to be attributes of a noun. Participles from such verbs cannot
in principle have this attributive adjective function (see §15.4.1.1.). In
examples such as (102)–(104), therefore, they must be regarded as the
predicate of reduced relative clauses:
(102) ""àna} ""íw6nwa jásūs ""è°ya tàma.} ‘I was a spy, (who had) come there’.
(B17:16)
(103) ""í°wa xa-Lelí°a °í°a m6n-ô?l.} ‘There was a Leli°a, (who had) come
from ôāl.’ (A19:1)
(104) ""u-""6n-í°6n náše ""è°ye m-ma°wá°a xène} ‘If there are people (who have)
come from other villages . . .’ (B5:60)526chapter fourteenSuch resultative participles may be used in nominalized phrases such as
(105), which, as has been shown, should be regarded as predicates of
reduced relative clauses:
(105) kúlla ""è°ye ""itléy š>rá†e t-amríla qa-màlka.} ‘All (those who have) come
have cases to tell the king.’ (A17:31)
Resultative participles of verbs that take a double direct object (§15.13.7.)
take the second object as their direct complement without any linking
preposition, e.g.
(106) díw6n-t málka hóle ŀí°a náše ràbe.} ‘The audience chamber of the
king is full of many people.’ (A17:31)
(107) ""6n-háwe plá†a m6n-""èrxe †íša qàmxa,} lá h>mèn6t ""êlle.} ‘If he is coming out of the water-mill covered in flour, do not trust him.’
(D2:61)
(108) ""aqára hóle dwíqa sêll6r.} ‘The farm land is packed hard with
frost.’
A noun may be modified by a following prepositional phrase. This is most
frequently a locative or partitive expression, e.g.
(109) ""u-náše gu-mðíta kúlle mˆ°ula.} ‘Bring all the people in the town.’
(A8:32)
(110) má°6t Dùre} gu-Bárw6r Bàla} m-záwna qamáya ""ì°wala} ""arbà ""umráne.}
‘The village of Dure in Barwari Bala from ancient times had
four churches.’ (B2:1)
(111) xzí°6lle bába dìya} ""u-""up-w8zīr mênne.} ‘She saw her father and also
the vizier with him.’ (A21:26)
(112) ""è°y6x xa-néra benà°6n.} ‘We came to a river between us (and the
town).’ (A17:9)
(113) díya ""èlla xá-mdi dàwa b8yi,} ya-ßlìwa,} ya-š6bbêr°a,} ""isèq°a m6n-d-án
yaqùre,} m-an-tàze.} ‘Now they only want something made of gold,
a cross, bracelet, a heavy, fine quality ring.’ (B10:40)
Such prepositional phrases may be combined with an adjective in the
modifying phrase, e.g.","[560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565]"
"496chapter fourteen(8)""ay-xá-yoma har-t-y9ða} t-íle mí°a bròn6n.} . . . p7ša ""áy ""àxxa,} b-šóp6t bròn6n.}
‘She will surely know one day that our son is dead. . . . Let her stay
here in the place of our son.’ (A4:39)
(9) lá xazèxle bròn6n.} ‘We shall not see our son.’ (A25:11)
(10) maqðêxle b7°6n.} ‘Let’s burn our house.’ (A26:51)
(11) qu-s7 k6s-d-anna-šwàw6n.} ‘Get up and go to these neighbours of
ours.’ (A5:1)
The short form is, however, also used in contexts where the reference of
the 1pl. suffix is exclusive, e.g.
(12) ""áxni l7le šùl6n.} har-sa-xúpla ""áti b-gàn6x!} ‘It is not our job. Go and
wash her yourself !’ (A27:25)
(13) mèxy6x6lla má°6n kúlla l-míla-w l-kóma m-bá°re dìye.} ‘We have covered
all our village with blue and black after he left.’ (A4:32)
The short form should, therefore, be regarded as the unmarked form that
can be used for both exclusive and inclusive reference, whereas the long
form is the marked form, which expresses only exclusive reference.
The long form of the 3pl. suffix, which consists of a diphthong, is the
most frequently used form of the suffix. It is found in all prosodic positions, e.g.
(14) ""u-šwiqála mðíta-w dè‰‰a ta-""a°rˆy.} ‘They left the town and returned
to their land.’ (A4:27)
(15) tá-t šaqlíle n6šmèy} ‘so that they could take away their soul’
(A4:59)
(16) bálki ""ad6téy hàtx5la.} ‘Perhaps their custom is that.’ (A4:36)
(17) brat7y gwìrt5la.} ‘Their daughter is married.’ (A30:29)
The occasional retraction of the stress from the long form of the suffix to
the penultimate syllable appears, however, to be prosodically motivated
since it tends to occurs within the interior of intonation groups and not
at their boundary, e.g.
(18) ""ap-xmárey šqìl6lla} daw7rey †rìð6lla.} ‘They also took their asses and
drove away their mules.’ (A7:15)the syntax of nominals497The use of the short form of the 3pl. pronominal suffix, in which the
diphthong is contracted to the monophthong -5 or -a, is pragmatically
motivated. It tends to be restricted to contexts where the suffix is predictable and has low information value, especially when it is coreferential
with the subject of the clause. This is no doubt due to the fact that in
these contexts the suffix is less likely to be confused with the basic nominal
inflectional ending -a, e.g.
(19) prím6lla sosiyà°a,} dèry6lla réše dìye.} ‘They had cut their locks and laid
them on him.’ (A31:10)
(20) xákma †5níwa xàßa} masqíwale bêdra.} ‘Some carried it on their back
and brought it up to the threshing floor.’ (B5:81)
(21) xayú°a q6m-mšax6lpìla.} ‘They changed their livelihood.’ (B5:75)
(22) ""u-xákma mxulßàla gána.} ‘Some saved themselves.’ (B6:18)
The contracted form of the suffix is frequently used also on numerals,
where no confusion with the nominal inflectional ending is possible, e.g.
têrw6°na ‘the two of them’ (A25:2), trà°na ‘the two of them’ (A25:6), †¬á°na
‘the three of them’ (A24:3), šáwwa°na ‘the seven of them’ (A23:15). Occurrences of the long form on numerals are also found, e.g. trá°ney ‘the two
of them’ (A26:89), †¬a°nèy ‘the three of them’ (A28:37).
14.5.2. Suffixes on the Independent Genitive Particle
The pronominal suffixes of a noun may be suffixed directly to it or by the
mediation of the independent genitive particle diy-. The genitive particle
is placed after the noun in an annexation relationship, the initial d- being
in origin the annexation particle:
3rd pers.ms.
fs.
pl.b7°a díye ~ b7°e díye
b7°a díya
b7°a diyéy‘his house’
‘her house’
‘their house’2nd pers.ms.
fs.
pl.b7°a díyux
b7°a díy6x
b7°a diy7xu‘your (ms.) house’
‘your (fs.) house’
‘your (pl.) house’1st pers.s.
pl.b7°a díyi
b7°a díy6n ~ b5°a diy7ni‘my house’
‘our house’498chapter fourteenNote that when the 3ms. form of the genitive particle is combined with
a noun, the 3ms. suffix (-e) may optionally be attached also to the noun,
which, in fact, is the more frequent construction.
The annexation between the head noun and the particle may undergo
various degrees of contraction. The final inflectional vowel of the noun
is sometimes reduced to the central vowel /6/, e.g. "">rá°6 díye ‘his lands’
(B5:73), m-zorú°6 dìy6n ‘from our childhood’ (B3:10), t6xrúny6 dìy6n ‘(according
to) our memory’ (B3:10). On several occasions the inflectional ending of
the head noun is completely elided, e.g. brōn-díye ‘his son’ (A14:36), brōn-díya
‘her son’ (A14:5), b6°-dìye ‘his house’ (B5:18), šùl dìya ‘its job’ (B5:90), ""8°6r
dìy6n ‘our country’ (A14:91), nāš-dìy6n ‘our people’ (B15:9), taqān-díye ‘its
branches’ (B5:206), x6zmān-dìye ‘his relatives’ (B5:60).
The distribution of the independent genitive partice and the motivation for its use differs according to the suffix. When the pronominal suffix
is 3ms. or 3fs., the genitive particle construction is the norm. This is no
doubt a device to disambiguate the pronominal suffixes -e (3ms.) and -a
(3fs.) from the simple nominal inflectional endings. Examples: qále díye
‘his voice’ (A25:43), kosí°a díya ‘her hat’ (A25:83), júlle díye ‘his clothes’
(A25:33). When two nouns are conjoined in a tightly-knit phrase, one
genitive particle may serve for the phrase as a whole, e.g. bábe yèmme díye
‘his mother and father’ (A25:11).
The genitive particle is occasionally omitted after 3ms. and 3fs. suffixes.
This occurs in principle where the interpretation of the suffix is highly
predictable from the context and it has low information value. A typical
context for this omission is where the suffixes are attached to words referring to body parts or implements and they refer unambiguously to the
subject of the clause or a topical referent in the discourse, e.g.
(1) mèxy6lla ""íðe hátxa gu-nar†óm6 sùsa.} ‘He put his hand like this on the
snout of the horse.’ (A12:65)
(2) ""áw6ð ""íðe xo-d-ò képa.} ‘He put his hand under the stone.’ (A12:30)
(3) ßléla dèmme r6š-pà°e.} ‘Blood flowed down onto his face.’ (A24:40)
(4) ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle.} ‘This man—his heard burst.’ (A31:2)
(5) ""7ne p°ìxt5la.} ‘His eye is open.’ (A31:6)
(6) šqílt6lla kosí°a díya hátxa m-rèša.} ‘She took off her hat from her head.’
(A25:82)
(7) ""áwwa mèxy5le s7pe l-qðál6 d-o-súsa.} ‘He drove his sword into the neck
of the horse.’ (A12:61)
(8) ""o-yála zóra žàre} šqíla ""aw-n9re mènne díye.} ‘The poor young boy took
that axe of his with him.’ (A14:12)the syntax of nominals499When the reference of the suffix on a direct object is different from that
of the subject, there is a greater tendency for the ‘heavier’ construction
with the genitive particle to be used, e.g.
(9) ""ína ""árya ""íðe díye q6m-axêlla.} ‘The lion ate his hand.’ (A11:1)
The particle is sometimes omitted before other types of inanimate inalienable possessions, e.g.
(10) de-qíma mtúny6lla q6ßßètte kúlla †la-d-o-sàwa.} ‘He told all his story to
the old man.’ (A14:76)
(11) mtagbèrwala g yān-díye xayù°e.} ‘He would support his life himself.’
(B5:74)
Animate inalienable possessions such as family relations in general take the
genitive particle, e.g. bábe díye ‘his father’ (A32:31), yèmme dìye ‘his mother’
(A14:5), xóne díye ‘his brother’ (A25:1), xále díye ‘his uncle’ (A25:45), bába
dìya ‘her father’ (A14:1), bróna dìya ‘her son’ (A14:4).
The genitive particle is sometimes omitted after a 3rd person singular suffix when the nominal phrase as a whole has reduced information
value due to its status in the discourse. This is exemplified in (12). Here
‘his dream’ in the initial announcement ‘Anybody who knows . . . what he
saw in his dream . . .’ has the gentive particle (x6lme diye), but later in the
discourse, where this announcement is repeated and does not convey new
information, the narrator uses the ‘lighter’ form without the particle to
express the same (x6lme):
(12) ""áwwa málka xzéle xa-xêlma.} . . . kút y8ðe . . . mòdile xèzya b-xèlme díye}
b-yawèlle ""êmma dáwe.} . . . ""o-xúwwe mêre} hà-naša} lˆk6t zála?} mère
b-álaha hon-zála k6s-màlka.} málka hóle xèzya xa-xêlma.} màra} kút-y>ðe
mòdile xèzya b-xèlme w-amêrre} b6d-šáq6l ""álpa dàwe.} ‘This king had
a dream. . . . Anybody who knows . . . what he saw in his dream, he
will give him a hundred gold coins. . . . The snake said “Hey, man,
where are you going?” He said “By God, I am going to the king.
The king has had a dream and says that anybody who knows
what he saw in his dream and tells him will have a thousand gold
pieces.”’ (A1:2–5)
Conversely, when a noun with a suffix is repeated in a clause that expresses
climax (13) or one that reiterates a fact to express its importance (14–15),500chapter fourteenthe genitive particle sometimes occurs in the second, more prominent,
clause but not in the first:
(13) q6m-maxéla ""áqla biš-x5làna,} q6m-parèla ""áqla dìya.} ‘He struck her leg
harder and burst her leg.’ (A33:12)
(14) ""ó K>r‰m,} bábe mìtle.} bábe díye mìtle.} ‘Now, the father of Karim died.
His father died.’ (A14:4)
(15) dwíq6lle, nšíq6lle, mútt6lle šòpe.} mútt6lle šópe dìye.} ‘He held him,
kissed him and put him in his place. He put him in his place.’
(A25:51)
The genitive particle with pronouns other than the 3ms. and 3fs. have a
different distribution.
The particle is often used when the head noun is an unadapted loanword, e.g. b8lam diyéy ‘their boat’ (A14:39), ˙àÄÄ díyi ‘my luck’ (A1:4),
quwāt-díy6n ‘our forces’ (A14:53), qêßß6t díyux ‘your story’ (A14:33). They
are also generally used after a proper name, e.g. Fárxo diyˆxu ‘your Farxo’
(A25:21), be-H7do diyˆni ‘our family of H5do’ (B8:1).
On common nouns with nominal inflectional endings, however, the
suffixes of the 1st and 2nd person and 3pl. tend to be attached directly
without the mediation of the genitive particle. Some cases are, nevertheless,
found where the genitive particle is used with these suffixes. This mostly
occurs when the speaker wishes to give some kind of prominence to the
suffix. In this group of suffixes it is the 1pl. suffix that is expressed by the
genitive particle with the greatest frequency. In most cases where the particle is used for the 1pl. suffix, the speaker is referring to a referent that
belongs to his community but not to that of the hearer, i.e. the 1pl. suffix
is ‘exclusive’. The exclusive interpretation arises from the prominence that
the heavy coding of the construction gives to the suffix, which is contrastive
in nature (‘ours not yours’). This can be compared to the exclusive 1pl.
function of the long suffix -5ni described above (§14.5.1.). The construction with the genitive particle is frequently used with the nouns denoting
the location of the speaker’s community, such as ma°a ‘village’ and ""a°‰a
‘country’, its people, institutions or aspects of its life, e.g.
(16) ""í°wal6n šawwá ""abòne} gu-má°a dìy6n.} ‘We had seven bishops in our
village.’ (B2:6)
(17) klá klá làxxa!} ""áwwa ""8°6‰ dìy6n-ile.} ‘Stop, stop here! This is our
land.’ (A14:91)the syntax of nominals501(18) ""u-gníw6lla ""êrwe} ""u-mupíð6lla b-˙ŭd°d} yá'ni ""á°‰a d-áy-got6t diyˆni.} ‘They
stole the small cattle and took them over the border, that is (the
border of ) the country on our side.’ (B5:161)
(19) har-m6dre-táma xzél6n nāš-dìy6n.} ‘Again we saw our relatives.’
(B15:9)
(20) ""áxni ""ax-t-íx bèny6lle ""úmra díy6n gu-""Ón-Nùne} ‘When we built our
church in ""“n-Nune . . .’ (B6:31)
(21) ""áti díya píšlux málka dìy6n,} málk6t maymùne.} ‘You have now become
our king, the king of the monkeys.’ (A14:45)
(22) sab-áxni xluláne dìy6n} hammáše y-oðêxwala} ‘eriy>wà°a.} ‘because we
always used to hold our weddings in Autumn.’ (B5:18)
(23) ""u-rába pšì††5wa xayú°a díy6n gu-ma°wá°a.} ‘Our life in the villages
was very simple.’ (B15:12)
In some cases the genitive particle has the long form of the 1pl. suffix,
e.g.
(24) ""ànn5la ""eð>wá°6 diy7ni.} ‘These are our festivals.’ (B6:16)
(25) náše diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
(B6:21)
The 1pl. suffix is given additional prominence in (26) by expressing it as
an independent phrase with a demonstrative head (""o-diy6n ‘our one’) and
placing this in apposition to the noun:
(26) máx gèšr6 Zàwa d-o-dìy6n} ‘like the bridge over our Zab’ (A30:51)
The genitive particle with a 1s. suffix is rarely attested in the text corpus.
In (27) it is clearly a contrastive focus:
(27) ""u-qále díye rába basìm5wa.} mút qála dìyi?} ‘His voice is very beautiful.
What is my voice (in comparison)?’ (A25:43–44)
In some cases the speaker appears to be giving prominence to the intrinsically exclusive nature of the 1s. reference, e.g.
(28) b8y6n xáðr6n gu-""úpra díyi xazênne.} ‘I (the king) want to go around
my own land to see it.’ (A14:47)
(29) mumˆ°5w6n,} kèm6t ""úrz6t dúnye ""á°a bá°ri le-y-azàna} †la-hì‘-""urza.} bas-""èn
""á°ya xá-baxta nabláli qa-kut-t-b9ya,} y6n-qa-xóna dìya,} ""ána bt-azàna.}502chapter fourteen
mèra ""àww5le qawla-díyi.} ‘“I have taken an oath that however many
men in the world may come after me I shall not go to any man.
But, if a woman comes to take me to anyone she wants, or to
her brother, I shall go.”’ She said “This is my word (i.e. which I
made to myself, not to anybody else).” ’ (A8:78–79)Likewise 2nd person suffixes are rarely expressed by the genitive particle.
The cases that are attested in the text corpus can be interpreted as having
the purpose of giving the suffix some kind of prominence. In (30)–(32) the
exclusivity of the 2nd person reference is given distinctness. In (30) and
(31) this is the exclusivity of a family or community. In (32) it connotes
the sense of uniqueness to the head noun:
(30) x6zmayú°a ""íla manáy ""6n-xá náša dìyux} yan-xá bráta díyux hot-híw6lla
qa-ðà-ma°a,} píše xêzme.} ""6n-""àti} m8°>lan xa-xêzmux} ""èn xa-nāš-dìyux}
""èn xa-gwíra m-ðá-ma°a xéta ""è°ye kêslux,} ""ánna y-amríla xêzme yá'ni.}
‘The meaning of family relationship is (as follows). If you have
given somebody of your family or a daughter of yours to a certain
village (in marriage), (the two families) become relatives. If a relative of yours, a person of your family or somebody married (into
your family) comes to you, they call these people family relatives.’
(B5:232)
(31) ku-brón6t bè‰-naša ""á°e l-d-áy j>zíra qamàye,} ""áwwa t-áwe málka diyˆxu.}
‘Whichever human being comes to the island first, he will be your
king.’ (A14:46)
(32) li° b6‰-náša hátxa b-aw-pêßla díyux.} m-hàd6x q6m-y>ðènnux.} ‘There is
nobody with that figure of yours (i.e. it is unique to you). That is
how I knew you.’ (A8:41)
In (33) the prominence gives added force to the assertion of a pragmatic
relation that is contrary to expectation:
(33) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ""àti parmètle réši.} ‘This
head of mine will one day be cut off by your own hands. You will
cut off my head.’ (A14: 35)
The genitive particle may be used independently of a head noun. If it
functions as an ascriptive predicate that assigns a property to the subject
of the clause, it requires no pronominal head, e.g.","[534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"
"444chapter thirteen13.3.20. šawp-, šop- ‘instead, in the place of ’
This is the noun šawpa ‘place, trace’ used adverbially. When used with this
adverbial function the diphthong is frequently contracted to /o/ (§2.4.2.).
It is combined with the following nominal in an annexation relation, e.g.
dáx páy6š málka šáwp6t bròni?} ‘How will he become king in place of my son?’
(A8:4), mútt6lle šópe dìye} ‘He put him in his place’ (A25:51), hálli b•sra šóp6t
lêxma} ‘Give me meat instead of bread’, šóp6 d-áw ‘instead of him’. It takes
pronominal suffixes, e.g. šópux ‘instead of you’, šóp6n ‘instead of us’.
13.3.21. t-la ‘without’
Examples: t-la-zùze} ‘without money’ (A24:23), t-lá mìya} ‘without water’
(B5:14), t-lá m5xòlta} ‘without food’ (B5:114), t-lá marăwà°5le o-márga?} ‘Is the
meadow without owners?’ (A25:60). It is connected to a following demonstrative pronoun by the subordinating particle D, e.g. t-lá d-o-náša ‘without
that man’, t-lá d-áw ‘without him’. Pronominal suffixes are expressed by
combining it with the independent genitive particle, e.g. t-lá díyi ‘without
me’, t-lá díyux ‘without you’. Occasionally the preposition b- is placed
before the genitive particle, e.g. t-la-b-dìyi ‘without me’ (A24:9).
13.3.22. la-/ta- ‘to, for’, object marker
Either of the two variant forms of the preposition, la- or ta-, are used
before nominals, e.g. maláxa m•re la-ràbb6n} ‘The angel said to the monk’
(A15:7), áwwa q ìlle la- árya} ‘He killed the lion’ (A11:1), híw6lla qu •rta
ta-màlla} ‘They gave the pot to the mullah’ (A5:8), d• a ta- a°rˆy} ‘They
returned to their land’ (A4:27).
They are connected to demonstrative pronouns and the interrogative
pronoun 5ni by the subordinating particle D, e.g. mtúny6lla q6 •tte kúlla
la-d-o-sàwa} ‘He told all his story to the old man’ (A14:76), pálga la-d-áy
u-pálga la-d-àw} ‘half for her and half for him’ (A4:46), bron6t-málka m•re
ta-d-an-wăzìre} ‘The son of the king said to the ministers’ (A14:40), o-bába
sáwa m•re ta-d-àni} ‘The old timer said to them’ (A14:85), la-d-7ni? ‘for
whom?’
Pronominal suffixes are added to the base form lal-, e.g. lále ‘to him’,
lálux ‘to you (ms.)’, láli ‘to me’, etc. Forms with the third person suffixes
may be extended by the independent genitive pronoun, e.g. lále díye ‘to
him’, lála díya ‘to her’. The form ta- may be combined with pronominalparticles445suffixes by means of the independent genitive particle, e.g. ta-dìyi} ‘to me’
(A25:84).
13.3.23. xo-, xo°- ‘under’
This is generally attached directly to the following word in the short form
xo-, e.g. xo-kosì°e} ‘under his hat’ (A23:6), xo-réša dìya} ‘under her head’
(A24:17), xo-ðà ilána,} ‘under a tree’ (A35:12). Occasionally the longer form
xo°- is used, e.g. áxni xo°-tagbárt6t màlk6x} ‘We are under the administration
of the king’ (A8:80).
The subordinating particle D is sporadically used to connect the preposition to a nominal without a demonstrative, e.g. xó-t má°a ‘under the
village’. It is regularly used before a demonstrative, e.g. xo-d-áwwa jùlla}
‘under this cloth’ (A25:49), xo-d-ò-kepa} ‘under that stone’ (A12:27), xo-d-à
ilána} ‘under that tree’ (A35:12).
Pronominal suffixes are attached to the base form xo°-, e.g. xó°e ‘under
him’, xó°ux ‘under you (ms.)’, xó°i ‘under me’. Third person suffixes may
be extended by the independent genitive particle, e.g. xó°e díye ‘under him’,
xó°a díya ‘under her’.
Sometimes xo-/xo°- is combined with the preposition m6n even when
static location is intended, e.g. u-m-xò°e} y-oðíwa nùra} ‘and under it they
would put fire’ (B5:183).
The original initial /t/ of this preposition is preserved in some proverbial sayings, e.g. íði txo-kèp5la} ‘My hand is under a stone’ (D2:20), míya
txo-tùna} ‘(He is like) water under straw’ (D2:42).

14.1. Expression of Definiteness
14.1.1. Preliminary Remarks
The term ‘definiteness’ can refer to a cognitive phenomenon in the act of
linguistic communication or to a feature in the grammatical structure of
a language. It is important to distinguish these, since the definiteness
of something on the cognitive level is not always signalled by the grammatical structure. When a nominal is said to be definite on the cognitive
level, this refers to the informational status of a nominal. The crucial
factor is the judgement by the speaker concerning the identifiability of
the referent by the hearer. If the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify which specific referent he is referring to by the nominal, the
nominal is treated by the speaker as definite in status. This assumption
is typically made when the referent has been mentioned previously or at
least is associated in some way with the context or situation that is being
talked about, or when the nominal has a unique referent, as is the case
with proper nouns. If, on the other hand, the speaker assumes that the
hearer cannot identify which specific referent he is talking about, the
nominal is treated as indefinite in status. The grammatical expression of
this definiteness varies across languages.
In Aramaic the distinction between the definite and indefinite status
of nominals was originally expressed grammatically by the distinction
between the ‘determined state’ and the ‘absolute state’ respectively. In
the NENA dialects, this original grammatical means of expressing the
distinction has broken down, but other devices have been developed to
compensate for its loss. In the C. Barwar dialect, as in other NENA dialects
and indeed as in many other languages, the cardinal numeral ‘one’ (xa
m., ða f.) is often used as an indefinite article that is a grammatical signal
of the indefinite status of the nominal. The dialect has not, however, a
corresponding definite article, though, as we shall see, there are embryonic
signs of this developing.","[482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488]"

(= it is not possible for us to do such a thing).’ (A8:10)
19.3.2. Direct Factive Complement
Direct complement clauses may also be of factual content. These are
typically found as complements of verbs such as ‘to say’, ‘to know’, ‘to
remember’, ‘to swear’, ‘to forget’. Various constructions are attested.
19.3.2.1. Zero Marking
The factive complement clause may be embedded under the verb without
any marking of subordination. This is regularly the case after the verb ‘to
say’ when the clause expresses reported speech and is frequently found
also after other verbs, e.g.
(1) hóla màra} xzí°6lle xa-bron6t-xà-malka.} ‘She says that she saw the son of
a king.’ (A4:12)
(2) ""ána hon-màra} ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘I say that
this head of mine will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
(3) lá-m6r5xu ""áyya qußárta hóla b-""ùrxa?} ‘Did you not say that this cooking
pot is on the way (to giving birth)?’ (A5:5)
(4) ""ána lán-mir6llux be-b9x6t-iw6t.} ""u-lán-mira qa†òl5w6t.} ""u-lán-mira xòšnaš5w6t.} ""u-lán-mira lebàn5w6t.} ‘I did not say that you are dishonest.
I did not say that you are a murderer. I did not say that you are a
good man. I did not say that you are a trickster.’ (A1:21)
(5) y>ðána mbádla qa†•lli ""aw-màlka.} ‘I know that the king will kill me in
the morning.’ (A14:3)
(6) ""áw lˆle ðíya málk5le.} ‘He did not know that he was the king.’ (A4:31)
(7) ""áx‘i b-txár6n hal-hadíya tre-†¬á-gaye mamxêxwala gán6n.} ‘But I remember
until now that we would have ourselves tapped (on the head) two
or three times.’ (B15:24)
(8) ""áni xášwi ""áti ""àn6n.} ‘They will think that you are me.’ (A7:18)
19.3.2.2. D
The clause may be introduced by the subordinator D, e.g.
(1) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
(2) ""ay-xá-yoma har-t-y9ða} t-íle mí°a bròn6n.} ‘She will surely know one day
that our son is dead.’ (A4:39)
(3) n•šya-wewa qáša t-wéwa yóm6t-tre rùta.} ‘The priest had forgotten that
the next day would be Friday.’ (A2:4)syntactic subordination of clauses981(4) ""ay-lˆða t-íle gáw‰a dìya ≥áre.} ‘The poor thing did not know that he

(5) ""áti m-ˆka-y>ð6t t-íx xon>wà°a?} ‘How do you know that we are brothers?’ (A39:6)
(6) pšám6n ràba} t-in-màr6ll5xu} qußart7xu mì°t5la.} ‘I am very sorry to tell
you that your cooking pot is dead.’ (A5:10)
19.3.2.3. Raising of Subject
In some cases the subject component of the embedded clause is raised
into the main clause where it functions as the direct object of the verb.
This is attested in (1)–(3), in which a pronominal copy of the subject of
the subordinate clause is attached as an object suffix to the main verb:
(1) ""u-y>ðánne xón6x hole-gòt6x.} ‘I know that your brother is by your side.’
(A8:79)
(2) m-ˆka q6m-y>ð•tli ""áti t-íw6n Gozáli?} ‘How did you know that I am
Gozali?’ (A8:41)
(3) bálki y>ðálux ""áti t-it-Gozàli.} ‘Perhaps she knows that you are Gozali.’
(A8:49)
19.3.3. ""iman
When the interrogative particle ""iman ‘when?’ is used as the governor of
a subordinate content clause, it has a temporal adverbial function. The
combination of ""iman + D is often reduced phonetically to ""im6t. The subordinate clause is normally placed before the main clause and, in most cases,
is uttered in a separate intonation group from that of the main clause.
The main clause may express an action that is temporally sequential to
the action in the subordinate clause or one that overlaps with it temporally.
19.3.3.1. Temporally Sequential
When the verb of the subordinate clause has a perfective aspect, expressing a
complete event, the main clause denotes an event that is sequential to this, e.g.
(1) ""ím6-t m†éla †únte dìye,} °éle xa-nàša,} q6m-šaqêlla ""5-†únte díye.} ‘When its
fruit became ripe, a man came and took its fruit.’ (A17:33)
(2) ""íman t-à°y6t,} ða-kista-xéta max-d-áy yawênn6x.} ‘When you come back,
I’ll give you another purse like that one.’ (A4:16)
Similarly a sequential relation exists between clauses expressing a habitual
series of events, e.g.","[1018, 1019, 1020]"
