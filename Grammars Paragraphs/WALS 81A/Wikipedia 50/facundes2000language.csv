The fact that I was not able to reproduce with various speakers the same behavior
in which OSV is interpreted as the default constituent order suggests that OSV cannot be
considered as an order type that is syntactically structured. That is, there is no general
syntactic template such as OSV in Apurinã that can override semantic or pragmatic
information. As a consequence, it would appear that the various types of constituent
order patterns are more likely to be motivated by discourse-pragmatic factors. If that
were the case, it would be natural for speakers to vary when evaluating clauses with
certain ambiguities as to ‘who did what.’8.10.5 Frequency Distribution of Constituent Order Types
On the basis of the data provided above, we can conclude that there are 5 transitive
and 2 intransitive general clausal constituent order types in Apurinã, as listed in Table 2.
Since the presence of AUX is also structurally optional, it has been omitted here. Also
omitted was the oblique argument of potentially ditransitive, described in 5.1.1.2..2. Table 2
554summarizes the information on the bound pronominal markers and on the optionality
property of post-verbal subject/object NPs:

s-V (S)*s-V-o (S) (O)In the remaining of this subsection, I will present a text frequency count based on
8 texts that include 3 traditional narratives, 1 personal narrative, 2 procedural texts, and 2
dialogs. The total number of clauses in the 8 texts is 744 units. No significant difference
in text genera has been attested, which, thus, justifies lumping them together here. That
is, when the texts are considered individually, no contradictory numbers appear. Lexical
and pronominal subject/object are not distinguished in the counts presented below. I
have ignored such a distinction for the purpose of this paper because the dominant
distribution of lexical subject and lexical object is not different from the dominant
distribution of pronominal subject and object respectively. Furthermore, in analyzing
constituent order types, I only considered clauses with verbal predicates. As a result, out
of 745 clauses, 244 non-verbal or objective descriptive predicates were excluded from the
count, thus leaving 501 clauses with verbal predicates. Both non-verbal and object
descriptive predicates differ from other non-descriptive verbal predicates in their
pronominal marking patterns and, as such, require a separate description. Further
investigation is required on the constituent order variation involving non-verbal and
objective descriptive predicates.
The next table shows the numbers for clauses with no NP-subject/object, clauses
555with only one NP-subject/object, and clauses with both NP-subject and NP-object cooccurring. As Table 3 shows, a little more than half of all clauses have at least one NPsubject/object. The second most frequent type is that in which there is no NPsubject/object. In only 8.6% of all clauses do we find NP-subject and NP-object cooccurring.","[585, 586, 587]"

Although in all of the examples in (126-131) subject and object are, for convenience,
expressed as independent pronouns, as further data will illustrate in the subsections
below, the facts are the same when subject and object are expressed as lexical NPs.
In the examples in (126-131), I have ignored the presence of the bound
pronominal forms attached to the verbs. These forms and their relation to constituent
order variation will be discussed in the following subsections. What I wish to underscore
here is the fact that except for VSO, all clausal constituent order patterns are acceptable
in the language. Furthermore, of the five order types attested in the elicitation of
transitive clauses, only the orders VOS and VSO are not attested in text material. I must
also notice that although VOS and VSO are not found in text material, VO and VS are.","[577, 578, 579]"

Generally speaking, information questions (also known as WH questions) “areused typically when the speaker and the hearer share the knowledge of a proposition —it
is presupposed or backgrounded —but the speaker does not know one element in the
proposition” (Givón 1990:2.793). As seen in the next subsections, various elements in a
sentence can be questioned. The major elements within a sentence that can be questioned
using a set of systematic question forms include subject/object, place, time, reason and
manner. The interrogative words are always sentence-initial.
8.8.2.2.1Questioning subject and objectThe form used to question the subject or object of a verb is ke-pa (or ki-pa,
depending on speech variety). As described in chapter 6, interrogative words in Apurinã
can be compared with interrogative words in other languages. ke- and -pa can be
compared with the WH initial in English or the QU initial in Romances languages such as
Portuguese. The difference is that ke- and -pa are more clearly segmentable as
morphemes in Apurinã, whereas the others are synchronically more opaque forms, and
also that ke- and -pa are two recurring forms in interrogative words, whereas there is only537one recurring form in English and Portuguese. The following examples are illustrative of
interrogative words questioning subject/object:
113a. ke-pa
oka-pe-ru
uwa-nhi?
WH-INT kill-PFTV-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
‘Who/what has killed kill him/it?’
b. ke-pa
p-oka-pe?
WH-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV
‘What/who have you killed?’
As the following examples show, when nouns such as suto ‘man’ and xenhi
‘meat’ occur as part of the interrogative word, the argument being questioned is more
specific, being semantically modified by the interrogative word:
114a. ke-suto-pa
kariwa
txa-wa?
WH-woman-INT white.person be-REFL
‘Which woman is a white person?’
b. ke-xenhi-pa
hare-ka?
WH-meat-INT be.good-PRED
‘Which meat is good?’
The interrogative forms in which a noun occurs as part of interrogative words
have been clearly attested in some speech varieties, and were also reported in Pickering
1977b. However, at least one speaker from the Paciá village reported that he himself
would rather use forms such as the following, where nhi- is added to mark subject/object
as a specific one:
115a. nhi-ke-ro-pa
kariwa
txa-wa?
SPEC-WH-3F-INT white.person be-REFL
‘Which woman is a white person?’538b. nhi-ke-ru-pa
ãkiti
oka-pe?
SPEC-WH-3M-INT jaguar kill-PFTV
‘Which jaguar has killed him/it?’
Further research is necessary in order to determine the extent to which this second type of
question marking is common in other speech varieties.
8.8.2.2.2Questioning TimeIn order to question time the TEMPORAL bound form -sawaku is added as part
of ke-pa subject/object interrogative word form, following the gender marker -ru, as the
following example illustrates:
116a. ke-ru-sawaku-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
WH-3M-TEMP-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘When have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.3Questioning ReasonIn questioning reasons it is the noun form nere ‘will, volition’ that is added as part
of the subject/object interrogative word form, as the following examples illustrate:
117a. ke-nere-pa
kariwa
i-txa-pẽ-ka-wa?
WH-will-INT white.person be-PFTV-PASS-REFL
‘Why has he become a white person?’
b. ke-nere-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
WH-will-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Why have you killed the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.4Questioning PlaceIn order to question places the interrogative word form nhã-pa (or yã-pa,
depending on speech variety) is used. The place interrogative word can occur by itself
539introducing an interrogative sentence questioning a place, as illustrated in (118a), or it
can have a pronominal bound form or the GOAL postpositional marker added into the
interrogative word form, as the examples in (118b-c), respectively, illustrate:
118a. nhã-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Where did you kill the jaguar?’
b. nhã-õ-pa
o-su-pe-ru?
PLACE-3F-INT 3F-go-PFTV-3M.O
‘Where has she gone?’
c. nha-monhi-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-GOAL-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘Where have you killed the jaguar?’
There is also an unrelated form that is used to question places, namely atapa-ru
(or ĩtepa-ru, depending on the speech variety). This second interrogative word form for
places does not allow the addition of other forms into it and is generally used in sentences
with nominal predicates, such as the one illustrated in the next example:
119. ata-pa-ru
ãkiti?
PLACE-INT-3M jaguar
‘Where is the jaguar?’8.8.2.2.5Questioning MannerIn order to question manner, the manner interrogative word kanhi-pa is used. The
manner interrogative word does not allow the addition of other forms into it. The
following examples are instances of kanhi-pa being used to introduce interrogative
sentences questioning manner:540120a. kanhi-pa
o-txa?
MANNER-INT 3F-do
‘How did she do (it)?’
b. kanhi-pa
pi-txa-pe?
MANNER-INT 2SG-do-PFTV
‘How did you do (it)?’
For interrogative sentences questioning manner there is also an unrelated form
that can be used, in addition to kanhi-pa, namely natoko-pa, as the following example
demonstrates. This second manner interrogative word also does not allow the addition of
other forms into it.
121. natoko-pa
p-oka-pe-ru
ãkiti?
MANNER-INT 2SG-kill-PFTV-3M.O jaguar
‘In which way have you killed the jaguar?’
8.8.2.3Indirect Content Questions
Indirect questions (or dependent interrogatives or embedded-WH questions,(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:186 and Givón 1990:2.804-806) consist of interrogative
clauses whose verbs take an information question as complement. Examples of such
verbs may include ‘ask’, ‘know’, and ‘announce’. Different from languages like English
and Portuguese, however, Apurinã does not make use of interrogative words in indirect
question. Instead, indirect questions use the same formal device of relative clauses
(described in detail in the next chapter, subsection 9.1.1), as illustrated in (122).

u-kama-kutu
1SG know-VBLZ-3M.O 3M-make-REL

b. nota umaru-ta-ru
o-sãbire-ta-kutu
1SG know-VBLZ-3M.O 3F-talk-VBLZ-REL
‘I know what she talked about.’
5418.8.3 Imperative Speech Acts
Imperative speech acts consists of “syntactic forms that explicitly convey some
subset of requests/commands/orders/suggestions/instructions/entreaties, and so on”
(Sadock and Zwicky 1985:170). Pickering (1971:28) lists various forms as marking
subsets of “imperative verbs”. However, commands, requests and instructions take no
special markers in the spontaneous discourse of any the speech varieties I have observed.
The only form I have observed to occur marking these imperative speech acts is the
bound verbal morpheme -poka, but this form was given by one speaker in elicited data.
The fact that this bound morpheme has been only found in elicited speech may suggest
that it is being left out of the language in more contemporaneous speech varieties. -poka
was described by Pickering as marking a “polite command”. The way they are used now
is more as commands, as the following examples illustrate:
123a. ĩporãã p-apa-poka
watxa
water 2SG-fetch-IMPER now
‘Go get water now.’
b. p-umaka-poka
2SG-sleep-IMPER
‘Go sleep.’
Other than examples such as these above, commands, orders etc. take no
additional marking forms. Instead, they lack a subject expressed by an independent NP;
their subject is expressed solely by the bound pronominal form for the second person
singular subject. In the following examples in (124), the sentences can be uttered as
command in (124a), a request in (124b) (repeated from (74)), and a warning in (124c):542124a. xamuna pu-taka xãã-poki-ã
firewood 2SG-put flame-border-INSTR
‘Put firewood in the fire.’
b. ĩporãã pu-suka-no
water 2SG-give-1SG.O
‘Bring me water.’
c. tsora! pu-muteka!
Tsora 2SG-run
‘Tsora! Run!’8.8.3.1Hortative Speech Act
Hortative sentences can be considered the subtype of imperative speech actwhere “the speaker is encouraging or inciting someone to action” (Bybee et al 1994:179),
thus different from commands, orders, instructions and the like. Hortative sentences are
marked with the clause-initial (h)amo ‘HORTATIVE’ particle already mentioned in
chapter 6. (h)amo is found in clauses about inviting someone to go somewhere, do
something (e.g. eat, dance, etc.) and so on. Aside from occurring only clause initially,
another restriction of this hortative marker is that it can only be used with first person
plural, as the following examples illustrate:
125a. hamo a-su-pe
HORT 1PL-go-PFTV
‘Let’ get going.’
b. hamo a-nhipoko-ta
HORT 1PL-eat-VBLZ
‘Let’s eat.’543c. hamo a-serena
HORT 1PL-dance
‘Let’s eat.’
HORT [s-V-o
O ]
d. hamo [a-kama-ro
ããta ]
HORT 1Pl-make-3M.O canoe
‘Let’s build a canoe”.’8.9. Summary: Evidence for Subject-Object
Distinctions
The notions of grammatical subject and grammatical object can be motivated on
the basis of various ways that the syntactic expressions of notional subject and notional
object behave in the clause, as summarized in Table 1. The distinct marking or
behavioral properties that the syntactic expressions of subject and object have in the same
set of clauses characterize a syntactic distinction between the two.

replaced with -wa
replaced with -kakaAt this stage in the description of the language no other unambiguous syntactic evidence
has be attested for distinguishing subject from object syntactically. Some of the syntactic
tests generally used to distinguish core grammatical relations are not conclusive, since the
results can be accounted for on semantic or discourse-pragmatic grounds rather than
syntactically. For this reason, I have defined subject and object over the coreferential
544properties of NPs with the pronominal markers in the verb. However, there are certain
problems that arise from defining subject and object over such morphosyntactic markers
(as will be seen in the discussion of relative clauses in the next chapter, in 9.1.1.6).
Finally, the distribution of subject and object NPs in simplex sentences cannot be
predicted on grammatical grounds. Further research is necessary in order to establish
whether/which specific discourse-pragmatic factors play any significant role in the
“decision” of Apurinã speakers to use one or another of the clausal constituent orders
found in the language. Nevertheless, it would appear that none of the clausal constituent
order types in the language can be argued to be more basic/neutral/unmarked than the
other in any way other than in terms of rather theory-specific assumptions or principles,
as will be shown in the next section.","[567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576]"

Facundesfor the degree ofDoctor of Philosophyin the Department of Linguistics to be taken January 2000Title: THE LANGUAGE OF THE APURINÃ PEOPLE OF BRAZIL
(MAIPURE/ARAWAK)A somewhat typologically informed grammatical description of the Apurinã
language is provided, including historical, socio-cultural, demographic and geographic
information about the Apurinã society. The Apurinã communities spread along
tributaries of the Purus River, in western Brazilian Amazon. The grammatical analysis
consists of the phonology, morphology and syntax, with appendixes on language
variation and the design of the Apurinã ortography, a text sample, a vocabulary list, and a
preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari. The grammatical analysis is
based on language internal factors, though with some typological observations on major
aspects. The segmental phonology is simple; morphophonemic alternations are restricted
to pronominal subject/possessor markers and a few other bound morphemes. Stress is
predictably penultimate, though with exceptions that need further investigation.
Although a preliminary analysis of prosodic structures is suggested, more work is
required in this area. The morphology is complex and includes special bound forms
which are partially distinguishable from typical affixes. Nouns and verbs are clearlyxxviidistinct syntactic categories; however, property-referring words are describable as a
subclass of intransitive verbs. Classificatory nouns are used as part of productive noun
compounding and a subset of them can be verb-incorporated and refer back to physical
and shape properties of participants previously mentioned in the discourse —in this way
resembling verb incorporated classifiers of North American languages. The description
of the syntactic organization of the language involves, to a great extent, examining the
functions and behavior of bound morphemes, and reaches its highest complexity in the
system of relative clauses. A subset of property-referring words, called objective
descriptive verbs, presents a morphologically marked split intransitivity system which is
partly based on the semantic class of these verbs. Such a system is typical of Arawak
languages. The constituent order is semi-free; the VO order is the most frequent in texts,
but the patterns of word order correlations point to OV. Overal, the Apurinã language
constitutes a laboratory for examining the interplay between morphological forms and
syntactic structure and functions, providing certain grammatical and semantic categories
and structures that resemble only in part those attested in other languages.xxviiiList of Abreviations and other Conventions UsedA

1.0. Introduction
The purpose of this dissertation is to present a preliminary grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. Apurinã is spoken by the Apurinã indigenous
people of the Northwestern Amazon region of Brazil. The Apurinã population may vary
in number depending on the parameters used to identify as Apurinã a person of Apurinã
ancestry living out of contact with an Apurinã community. Intra-culturally, these
parameters may be determined by the extent to which this person (and/or others in his/her
environment) is aware of his/her Apurinã ancestry. Sometimes, a person may claim the
Apurinã ancestry for potential government help (poorly) provided to indigenous peoples.
The dissertation is organized as follows: Chapter 1 is the introduction, where
some general information on the language and the people who speak it is presented;
chapter 2 presents the phonemic inventory, articulatory phonetics and phonological
analysis of the language, in addition to the orthographic system for the language; chapter
3 presents an introduction to Apurinã morphology where the major concepts used in
chapters 4-7 will be introduced; chapters 4-6 present the morphology of the noun, verb
and closed word classes in that order, and the their relevant syntactic properties; chapter 7
presents a special set of bound morphemes that share properties of affixes as well as of
independent words in a clitic-like fashion; chapter 8 presents the constituent structure
1analysis of phrases and the clause, an analysis of grammatical relations, predicates and
the syntactic properties that operate at the level of simplex sentences; chapter 9 presents
the structure of complex sentences; the conclusion summarizes the major aspects of the
Apurinã grammar covered in this work and points to parts of the grammar that deserve
further investigation. Appendix A summarizes some general information on issues
involved in the design of the Apurinã orthography and on a general picture of dialectal
variation. Appendix B provides a text sample consisting of an Apurinã traditional story.
Appendix C provides a vocabulary sample of the language. Finally, appendix D presents
a summary of a lexical comparison involving Apurinã and its closest extant languages,
Piro and Iñapari to arrive at a preliminary phonological reconstruction of Proto-ApurinãPiro-Iñapari.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
"Clausal Constituent Order Variation inSimplex Sentences
The (morpho)syntactic properties considered in the next subsections correspond,
respectively, to the distribution of the NP-subject and the NP-object in the clause, and to
the patterns of bound pronominal markers in the verb as they correlate with the
distribution of NP-subject and NP-object in simplex sentences. The information provided
below on constituent order variation has already been made partly explicit in various
parts of this and the previous chapters, and will be systematically presented now. The
analysis presented below is restricted to NP-subjects and NP-objects, the distribution of
clausal constituents bearing oblique grammatical relations is not included here. As was
shown in the previous chapter, in section 7.5, NPobls can occur almost anywhere in the
545clause, except that they depend in part on the individual properties of each of the various
types of oblique constituents. These individual properties require further investigation
before a detailed analysis of oblique constituents can be presented, and they will not be
discussed in this work.","[576, 577]"
"8.10.1 Clauses with Co-Occurring NP-Subject and NP-Object
If we only consider clauses in which subject and object co-occur as NPs, we can
describe Apurinã as a language that has semi-free constituent order variation. This is
so because, of the six logically possible constituent order types in a language,
i.e.",[577]
"556The next table shows the number for pre- versus post-verbal subject. Table 5
shows an unequivocal tendency for subjects to occur pre-verbally rather than postverbally:

(9%)170
(100%)Table 6, on the other hand, shows that post-verbal (rather than pre-verbal)
position is dominant for object. The higher frequency of post-verbal over pre-verbal
object, however, is not as more frequent as the higher frequency of pre-verbal over postverbal subject.

"4708.3.1 Core Grammatical Relations
Core grammatical relations have been defined above both in terms of generally
taking the form of a NP to express arguments of a verb, as well as in terms of expressing
arguments that are required by the lexical meaning of the verb. The latter part of the
definition can be considered of greater importance, since, as will be seen later (8.3.1.2,
8.3.2.4 and 8.3.2.5), there are two subclasses of oblique grammatical relations that can be
encoded as NPs. There are two types of core grammatical relations that can be
distinguished on the basis of a cluster of properties associated with one but not the other
NPs expressing argument functions. These are referred to by the traditional labels
(grammatical) subject and (grammatical) object. As will be seen later, in section 8.9,
the distribution of clausal constituents in a sentence cannot be used as a defining criterion
for subject- and objecthood, since the position of such clausal constituents may vary in
ways that cannot be predicted on the basis of specific grammatical factors. That is, there
is enough variation in the order of clausal constituents so as to make it impossible to tell
whether a NP bears subject or object grammatical relation to the verb purely on the basis
of its position in a sentence. The data on clausal constituent order variation will be
systematically described in 8.9.
In earlier chapters, the notions that were referred to as “subject/object” were
preliminarily defined over the morphological co-referential pronominal markers that
occur on the verb. In motivating the notions of subject and object, it is counted as
evidence for the existence of subject certain syntactic behavior which are intrinsically
associated with the putative subject NPs and which the putative object NPs do not share.
The reverse is also true. These distinctions in behavior are taken to represent the
471realization of distinctive syntactic properties characterizing subject and object, and that
also single out grammatical relations as distinct from semantic or pragmatic ones.6
The evidence generally considered in defining subject can be characterized as one
of overt coding properties, behavior-and-control properties, or functional properties
(Givón 1995:228-252, adapted from Keenan 1976). Overt-coding properties are those
consisting of morphosyntactic distinctions between subject and object NPs; behaviorand-control properties are those consisting of syntactic operations (such as
reflexivization, relativization etc.) which one but not the other NP argument can undergo;
and functional properties consist of semantic, referential or pragmatic roles that can be
associated with one but not the other NP argument. Since the analytical goal here is to
determine whether subject and object can be distinguished syntactically, only overt
coding and behavior-and-control properties are considered as evidence here. Functional
properties, on the other hand, will be mentioned only to show that subject/object
grammatical relations cannot be reduced to purely semantic or pragmatic notions.
8.3.1.1Subject
It may be best to start by showing that subject cannot be identified/reduced to itsmost typical semantic or pragmatic correlate. Rather than illustrating the dissociation
between subject/object and each relevant semantic role, I will illustrate the dissociation
between subject/object and the semantic macroroles (Van Valin and LaPolla 1997:139146). The notion of “semantic macroroles” subsumes a number of specific semantic roles
on the basis of their meaning similarities and of how they are most often formally6Some of the major typological and theoretical discussions on grammatical relations that influenced the description
presented here are found in Van Valin and LaPolla 1997, Givón 1995:225:304, Croft 1990:95-123, Comrie
1989:104-123, Dryer 1986, Andrews 1985:62-164, DeLancey 1984, and Keenan 1976.","[501, 502, 503]"
"612Chapter 10Concluding Remarks
In this work I have presented a somewhat typologically informed grammatical
description of the Apurinã language. In the first chapter the socio-cultural context where
the language is spoken was summarized. The group of Apurinã speakers is nowadays
mainly made of elders, and few of the children are learning the language. These
characteristics, in addition to the others described in the first chapter, place Apurinã
among the endangered languages of the Amazon region of Brazil.
As seen in chapter 2, the segmental phonology of the language is organized in
relatively simple terms. The language has a (C)(V)V syllable template and its
morphophonological alternations are restricted to the subject/possessor markers and a few
other bound morphemes. Stress is mostly predictably penultimate, although sensitive to
syllable weight —as determined by nasality and lengthening. Further research needs to
be done in order to explain the exceptions to the general patterns described in chapter 2,
especially with respect to the possibility of the same word form to vary in its primary
stress position. Only a tentative analysis was presented on intonation in Apurinã; more
research is necessary in the prosodic structure of the language.
Perhaps to compensate for the simplicity of the phonological system of the
language, its morphology is extremely rich. Bound morphemes abound in the language,
especially in the verb, with a great variety of functions. Due to this typological
characteristic of this language with respect to its morphological system, five chapters (36137) were spent describing, respectively, a general introduction to morphology, the noun
morphology, verb morphology, closed word class morphology, and special bound
morphology. It is this richness in morphological forms and their specific functions that
give Apurinã characteristics associated with so-called polysynthetic languages. Nouns
and verbs can be independently motivated as distinct parts-of-speech on morphological as
well as syntactic grounds. Adverbial and adjectival meanings, on the other hand, have
their typical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes or particles, in the first
case, and, in the second case, by bound morphemes, classificatory nouns and descriptive
verbs. Special bound morphemes are less than typical affix forms that can be classified
as floating, quasi-floating, or non-floating in terms of whether they occur with different
word categories or not. Aside from the floating characteristics of bound morphemes they
show the common property of occurring as the “outer”-most layers of bound morphemes
in their word bases. Moreover, some of them interact in special ways with syntactic
phenomena as, for example, the complementary distribution that is found between
subject/object pronominal markers and coreferential pre-verbal subject/object
expressions, or subject/possessor markers and free coreferential possessor expressions.
These particular properties of special bound formatives are comparable to properties
associated with independent words, thus making them behave as clitic-like forms. On the
other hand, the fixed linear position of special bound formatives is a property they share
with the more typical affixes found in the language.
Two features of the morphosyntax of the language can be considered somewhat
particular. First, certain inalienable noun forms are productively used as part of
compound nouns in ways reminiscent to numeral classifiers. Such nouns are used with
classificatory functions to refer to (or impose) semantic features related to the shape and
614consistency of the referent expressed by the compound noun. Not only that, these
classificatory nouns can also occur incorporated in the verb and, in this position, be used
with anaphoric-like functions. Second, the bound formatives can be seen as organized in
hierarchical “layers” that are motivated by the distribution of distinct sets of these bound
forms. From a cross-linguistic and theoretical perspective, while the description of
classificatory nouns can contribute to a better understanding of the ontology as well as,
perhaps, the ontogeny of classifying systems, the properties of special bound formatives
may serve as an inportant source of information on the interaction of syntactic and
morphological processes.
Since the present description of the Apurinã grammar is part of an on-going
research project, it was not possible to be equally specific about every part of the
grammar. As a consequence, chapters 8-9 describe only the major parts of the syntax of
the language. I should also note that the lack of a more detailed description of the syntax
of the language does not imply that there is little of specific behavior of forms that can be
characterized as syntactic in this language. Although it is the case that the Apurinã
syntax is not so much about inter-clausal operations, but much more about what happens
intra-clausally, much of the morphology of the language cannot be accounted for without
making reference to the clause or other clause-level elements.
To a great extent, the syntax of Apurinã consists of the functional or distributional
behavior expressed by bound formatives. The notions of a grammatical subject and a
grammatical object can be established partly on the basis of two paradigms of bound
pronominal forms, one used for subject and the other for object grammatical relations,
and the way these grammatical relations pattern in causative, reciprocal, reflexive and
relative constructions. Oblique grammatical relations are generally marked with oblique
615markers that attach to (pro)nominal forms. A VP constituent cannot be easily motivated
on the basis of language internal evidence and empirical grounds. Inter-clausal relations
can be marked with a few subordinator forms, but such relations are more often (in terms
of token as well as type sentences) expressed by juxtaposition —as is the case of sentence
conjoining.
Although Apurinã discourse-pragmatics and a detailed sociolinguistic description
of the language and its socio-cultural correlates have been left out of this study, they
constitute very important aspects of the language description that shall be part of future
revisions of this work. A part of the language where discourse and pragmatic factors play
a very important role is with respect to clausal constituent order variation, which is quite
free in the language. The socio-cultural variables that may play a significant role in
language variation may turn out to explain part of the “irregularities” attested in the
present description of the language grammar. Finally, in this work I have not attempted
to establish comparisons between Apurinã and other Arawak languages (except for the
preliminary reconstruction for Proto-Apurinã-Piro-Iñapari given in appendix D);
however, further investigation on diachronic developments in the grammar as well as
further typological-comparative work within Arawak might also shed new lights on
phenomena that seem to be arbitrary from a purely synchronic point of view.","[643, 644, 645, 646, 647]"
"558The fact that clauses where one NP-subject/object occurs and clauses where both
NP-subject and NP-object co-occur constitute only 60% of the total number of clauses
attested in the language (i.e., in my text database; cf. numbers in Table 3) requires that a
rather large corpus of texts be used in analyzing discourse-pragmatic factors involved in
constituent order variation. Nevertheless, the fact that no clear-cut relationship can be
attested between discourse-pragmatic factors and the type of constituents order used by
itself suggests the unlikelyhood that a single constituent order type can be convincingly
associated to a single (unmarked/neutral) discourse-pragmatic factor.","[589, 590]"
"8.1.2 Verb and the Object NP
Now that the structure of NP(obl)s have been motivated and their structure
described, it is worth inquiring whether there is any way that the verb plus the object NP
constitute a separate phrasal constituent, different from NP(obl)s. At the present time there
is no convincing positive evidence to argue that a verb plus the object NP form a phrasal
unit similar to, for example, the verb phrase (hereafter VP) in English or in other
languages where such a constituent can be motivated. The closest thing we can find to a
replacement test would consist of the replacement of the verb plus the NP object
construction by the verbal form txa described under 5.11.4. So, in (37a) suto ‘woman’ is
a NP subject of the clause, and nhika-ru nhipoko-ru1 ‘ate food’ is the predication about
the subject. In (37b) we see that the whole predication about the subject can be replaced
with the form txa-ru ‘do-3M.O’:
37a. suto
[nhika-ru [nhipoko-ru]NP ]?
woman eat-3M.O food-UNPOSS
‘The woman ate food.’
b. o-[txa-ru]
3F-do-3M.O
‘She did it.’
The use of txa-ru to replace an intransitive verb or a transitive verb plus its NP object is
common in the language. This particular use of txa-ru may be what led Aberdour
(1985:46) to label txa a “summary verb”, since in a way it sort of “summarizes” the
meaning of a predication previously expressed in the discourse. To the extent that txa is
462used anaphorically to express the meaning of a previous predicate, it could be argued to
serve as evidence, on the basis of the replacement test, for treating the verb plus NP
object construction as a VP. In the next example in (38), however, we see that the NP
expressing the notional object nhipokoru, that seemed to be internal to the predication in
(37a), occurs clause initially, without the addition of any phonological pause:
nhika
38. [nhipoko-ru]NP suto
food-UNPOSS woman eat
‘The woman ate food.’
The fact that the verb and the NP object can be separated by the NP subject needs to be
explained in order to maintain a VP analysis. It is possible that the clause initial NP
object illustrated in (38) is restricted to clauses that are somehow marked (structurally
and/or pragmatically) and derivable from clausal structures such as that represented by
(37a). However, such a markedness would still need to be established in the language.
The fact is that further evidence would need to be gathered in order to motivate a VP in
Apurinã. Traditional tests such as conjoined constructions are not found in the language
(as already noticed by Pickering 1974; see also discussion on juxtaposition in chapter 9,
in 9.2) and, thus, cannot be used as a constituency test for VPs. Without the firmer
support of other evidence, the predication will NOT be treated here as contained within a
VP, but rather as a V and a (structurally optional) NP object both as immediate
constituents of the clause.","[493, 494]"
"8.10.4 Constituent Order Resolution in Potentially Ambiguous Sentences
In Facundes 1994 I described clauses with no bound pronominal markers attached
to the verb. In principle, unless semantics or discourse-pragmatics made it clear who the
subject or object was, such clauses would be ambiguous as to their interpretation of who
did what to whom. In clauses such as the following in (145), semantics and/or discoursepragmatics would suffice to provide the correct interpretation of the clause. This is true
since ‘I ate the food’ expresses a trivial and natural event. ‘The food ate me,’ on the
other hand, would require a conception rather distinct from the way the event of ‘eating’
is normally conceived in the Apurinã world of natural events —which, of course, could
be licensed by the specific context of mythological stories but less likely in the context of
everyday language.

O
V
b. nota nhipoko-ru2
nhika
1SG food-UNPOSS eat
‘I ate the food.’
(*The food ate me.)
Clauses such as those in (146) could have a default interpretation in which the
man is thought to be a hunter, and, since more stories are about the hunters than about the
hunted animals, the hunter would more typically be interpreted as the subject of the
clause. Here however, one just needs to change the perspective of the person uttering the
clause (to, e.g., one in which the tapir escaped because it saw the man and ran away) for
the second interpretation to be more natural. That is, a minor addition of contextual
specific information here would suffice to change the default interpretation.
O
S
V
146a. kema kuku atama

‘The man saw the tapir.’
‘The tapir saw the man.’
S
O
V
b. kuku kema atama
man tapir see
‘The man saw the tapir.’
‘The tapir saw the man.’
In the next example in (147), however, there is nothing semantically or
pragmatically associated with Mipatu or Mipake to make either of them ‘the one who
sees’ or ‘the one who is seen.’ There is no pragmatic default interpretation, as far as I can
tell, that can be associated with Mipatu or Mipake, as the two individuals are cousins who
live in the same village. Thus, in this example, neither semantics nor a default pragmatic
interpretation can be used as clues as to what the correct interpretation of the clause is. In
553Facundes (1994a), I used similar data to argue that OSV was the default interpretation for
examples that lack semantics or default pragmatic properties that could resolve the
ambiguity. Indeed, it is true that some speakers choose OSV as default interpretation
when ambiguity cannot be resolved by semantics and pragmatics. However, now it is
also clear that the strategy used to resolve ambiguity varies across different speakers. I
have not been able to confirm OSV as default order for more than a handful of speakers.","[583, 584, 585]"
"1.6. Apurinã and Linguistic Typology
Apurinã has typical properties of a polysynthetic language insofar as it has a rich
system of grammatical functions expressed by means of bound morphemes —not only
the functions typologically expressed by grammatical morphemes across many languages
but also functions typologically expressed by lexical morphemes. Different, however,
from many of the polysynthetic languages of North America, Apurinã is more of an
agglutinative (rather than fusional) type language; the language has a (C)(V)V syllable
structure, and morphophonological alternations are basically restricted to proclitic-like
pronominal markers and to a few other verb bound forms.
The language has characteristics of a head-marking type language in having, for
instance, cross-referencing markings on verbs and possession markers on the head
possessed noun. The rich morphology of this language does not at all imply the lack of
syntactic operations; instead, it simply means that many grammatical functions are
formally encoded in the morphosyntax, i.e. they are expressed by forms that partially
obey morphological rules as to their distribution, but syntactic conventions as to their use
and allocation in the clause. As to clausal constituent order, the language is52predominantly OV in terms of its word order corelations, although the most frequent
order in text is VO. The language also has a gender system based on the
feminine-masculine grammatical distinction, a morphologically marked noun class
system based on alienable versus inalienable possession, and an incipient noun
classification system consisting of nouns with classificatory functions that recur as part of
a productive noun compounding system.","[83, 84]"
"442Chapter 8Simplex Sentences
8.0. Introduction
This chapter describes both the constituency and relational properties of syntactic
expressions (i.e. NPs and NPobls) of the arguments of the verb and the various properties
of clauses and predicates found in the language. Particular attention is given to the NPs
encoding notional arguments required by the lexical meaning of the verb to show the
evidence that can be used to construe the core syntactic relations subject and object.
Chapters 3-7 have presented the internal morphological structure and the syntax of word
categories. Now it is also time to show whether it is required to make use of syntactic
notions different from the purely structural ones, and, furthermore, if such notions can be
motivated, to show what types of constructions arise when relational and constituent
syntactic properties are considered, and what their distribution in the clause is. Before
describing the relevant data and their syntactic status, a few syntactic labels need to be
introduced and properly defined.
In the previous chapters, I have used the term “clause” to refer to any construction
involving a (pro)nominal form (including bound pronominal markers) plus some
predication of it. In this and the next chapters I will continue to use clause to name any
syntactic construction containing a single predicator. So, the examples in (1a-b) are both
instances of clauses. In (1a), su-pe-ka-ko ‘go-PFTV-PRED-FUT’ is the predicator and
443nota ‘1SG’ is the argument of the verb; in (1b), sãpaka-pe-ka ‘be.tired-PFTV-PRED’ is
the predicator, and nota ‘1SG’ again is the argument of the verb:
1a. nota su-pe-ka-ko
1SG go-PFTV-PRED-FUT
‘I’ll get going.’
b. nota sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’m already tired.’
Furthermore, I will reserve the term sentence to name any one or more clauses
that can stand by themselves in Apurinã discourse. That is, an Apurinã sentence will
consist of a single independent clause or of an independent clause plus one (or more)
dependent (i.e. subordinate, see chapter 9, section 9.1) one(s). So, each one of the two
examples in (1) above constitutes an instance of a sentence, as well as the combination of
an independent and a dependent clause in (2):
2. nu-su-pe-ka-ko
kotxi
nu-sãpaka-pe-ka
1SG-go-PFTV-PRED-FUT SUBORD 1SG-be.tired-PFTV-PRED
‘I’ll get going because I’m already tired.’
What is of interest in this chapter are the mono-clausal sentences, as represented by the
examples in (1), rather than multi-clausal sentences, as represented by the example in (2).
In order to facilitate the presentation of mono- versus multi-clausal sentences I will refer
to the former as simplex sentences, and to the later as complex sentences. Complex
sentences will be dealt with in the next chapter. I should note that the term “simplex”
(rather than “simple”) is used here so as NOT to imply that the relevant sentences are
necessarily simpler in any trivial way than complex sentences, since it is possible for
certain simplex sentences to involve more complex structures than certain complex ones.
444In using the terms just introduced I intend to make a compromise between presenting a
description of the Apurinã syntax in terms of concepts that can be clearly motivated in
the language on the basis of its internal properties and that, at the same time, are
crosslinguistically sound.
Therefore, sentence, as it is defined in the syntax of Apurinã, is an abstract
construct that can only achieve audible realization through clause(s). What the next
sections will show is that such an abstract concept is not only useful but, also, it can be
easily motivated on the basis of the data to be described in this and the next chapter.
Moreover, such a definition of the Apurinã sentence will partly match the (perhaps) most
often cited general definitions of “sentence” found in the linguistic literature, such as the
ones represented by (3-8):
3. “The sentence is considered here not as a unit consisting of a predicate and nouns
related to it (a simple clause), but rather as a combination of such units (clauses) into still
larger structures of a sort here summarized.” (Longacre 1985:235)
4. “The sentence is the largest unit of grammatical description.” (Bloomfield, as
presented in Lyons 1968:172)
5. “As a grammatical unit, the sentence is an abstract entity in terms of which the linguist
accounts for the distributional relations holding within utterances.” (1968:176)
6. “[T]he sentence in turn can be defined as the maximal unit of syntax, or the largest
unit over which constructional relations hold.” (Matthews 1981:29)
7. The sentence is “[t]he largest unit in terms of which the grammar of a language is
organized.” (Crystal 1992:349)4458. “In generative grammar, [the sentence is] the syntactic category which is taken as the
largest category capable of syntactic characterization, all of its component parts being
bound together by rules of syntax and its entire structure being well-formed.” (Trask
1992:250-251)
However, one should also bear in mind that there are perhaps as many putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” as the number of different syntactic theories.
The definition used here follows from the properties of the Apurinã grammar as well as
(partly) from what implicitly or explicitly is found in some of those putative
crosslinguistic definitions of “sentence” (such as the ones given in 3-8). In the way
conceived here, the notion of “sentence”, as unit of syntax, is an abstract construct in a
way analogous to the way in which “phoneme”, as a unit of phonology, and “morpheme”,
as unit of morphology, also are abstract constructs.18.1. The Structure of Phrases
The goal of this section is to motivate and describe the constituent structure of
clauses. In providing evidence for parts of speech as units involved in the organization of
clauses, by implication, I have also provided motivation for treating words as constituents
of the clause. What needs to be examined now is the extent to which words can combine
into larger constituents within a clause. There is no question that words constitute
individual constituents within the clause. So, for example, in the first of the three clauses
in (9a), suto ‘woman’ occurs preceding the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. As shown by the1I have found particular useful the discussions in Lyons 1968:172-180 and Matthews 1981:ch.2 on the various
definitions of “sentence”, where detailed references on the subject are also provided.","[473, 474, 475, 476, 477]"

"8.10.2 Pre- versus Post-Verbal Subject/Object-NPs
In any order type in which there is a post-verbal NP functioning as subject or
object, there has to be also a bound pronominal marker attached to the verb that is
coreferential with the post-verbal subject or object. In contrast, in any order type in
which the NP-subject/object is pre-verbal, no bound pronominal marker that crossreferences the NP-subject/object can be found on the verb.23 Examples such as those23It is true, however, in my database (as it was in Aberdour’s 1985) that some rather marginal exceptions can be
attested in text material.",[579]

still uncertain of, as will be made explicit in the subsections where they are respectively
described. Except for the forms having a question mark, all other relative pronominal
markers in the language have been clearly attested. As suggested by the information
summarized in Table 1, the relative pronominal markers form a rich system for coding
various piece of information about the relative clause and its components: i.e. the
grammatical relation of the headREL in the relative clause, as well as its gender and
number; the (positive/negative) polarity of the verb; the “actorlessness” of the verb; and a
sort of hierarchical role of the participants when expressed as pronominal forms.
Although it is possible to break down the relative pronominal markers given in Table 1
564into component parts, for the moment they will be described in terms of the general
function these four-segment phonemic clusters have as markers of ClRELs. The final
subsection in 9.1.1.5 will present a more detailed morphological breakdown of these
tetrad-partite phonemic clusters, with a discussion on the syntactic status of the verb
which results from the presence of such clusters.
Various of the examples illustrating the use of relative pronominal markers
originate in elicited material. I have chosen to use such data here for two major reasons:
First, because they are used systematically enough in elicited material so as to suggest
that speakers are aware of their function in the language grammar, and, second, because
some of the relative pronominal forms are not easily found in text material (in, general,
regardless of genre). The extent to which they are not found so often in text material may
suggest that (at least for some speakers) they are in the process of going out of use, either
due to language contact influence or just as a natural consequence of internal language
change. The next subsections describe each of the functions of the relative pronominal
forms listed in the table above, and the subtypes of ClRELs distinguished by these
pronominal forms.
9.1.1.1.2The Role of the HeadREL in the Relative ClauseThe first opposition encoded by the relative markers that is illustrated below is
that concerning their role in the clause while encoding core grammatical relations, i.e.
subject and objects. The sentences in (6) illustrate two independent clauses. The subject
of the first and second clauses are both suto ‘woman’, and (in the context used here) they
are coreferential. In order to relativize the subject of the first clause, i.e. suto, making
this subject a headREL, the coreferential relative pronominal marker -karo is added to the
565verb of the first clause. The resulting complex sentence (containing a relative clause) in
(7) (already given above in (2) is formed when the two sentences in (6) are combined:
O
S
V
6a. kuku suto
karota
man woman hurt
‘The woman hurt the man.’
S
V
b. suto
apo-pe
woman arrive-PFTV
‘The woman arrived.’

[O
V-rel.s ]ClREL
V
7. suto
kuku karota-karo
apo-pe
woman man hurt-REL.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘The woman who hurt the man arrived.’
That is, as a result of adding -karo to the verb of the sentence in (6a), this sentence is
“nominalized”, becoming a relative clause embedded as the subject of the matrix clause.
(The meaning of the term “nominalized” as it applies to ClRELs is discussed in detail in
9.1.1.6.)
In contrast to (7) the next example in (8) has suto again as the headREL and kuku
karota-kuto ‘whom the man hurt’ is the ClREL:
S/O
[S
V-rel.o
]ClREL V
8. suto
kuku
karota-kuto
apo-pe
woman man
hurt-REL.F.O
arrive-PFTV
‘The woman whom the man hurt has arrived.’
While in (7) the relative pronominal marker is -karu, the example in (8) shows a different
pronominal marker attached to the verb, namely -kuto. As is clear in (8), when the
relative pronominal marker -karo is replaced with the relative pronominal marker -kuto
566the result is that the headREL suto is interpreted as the object of the ClREL. Note that since
suto ‘woman’ is the headREL in both the complex sentences in (7) and (8) there is no
difference in person or gender information. Moreover, since everything else in (7) and
(8) is the same, the only distinct grammatical functions -karo and -kuto may correspond
to is that of subject and object, respectively. Hence the relative pronominal markers
directly encode the subject versus object grammatical distinction.
In (9a), the example illustrates a case where the headREL, suto, is the goal
argument of the verb of the ClREL, nhipoko-ru2 nu-suka-kuto ‘whom I gave the food to’,
whereas in (9b) it is nhipoko-ru2 ‘food-UNPOSS’ that is the headREL, showing that both
the expressions for undergoer (here including the argument of objective descritive verbs)
and the expressions for goal arguments follow the same relativization strategy:

‘The food that I gave to the woman was good.’
In complex sentences containing ClRELs the only grammatical relation which is
relevant for relativization is that played by the headREL in the ClREL. That is, the role of
the headREL in the matrix clause is completely irrelevant for the formal encoding of
relativization in Apurinã. This irrelevance of the role of the headREL in the matrix clause
for the formal markings of ClRELs can be seen by comparing the examples given in (7),
(8) and (9) with the following examples in (10). In all the examples of ClRELs in (7), (8)
and (9a) the headREL is subject in the matrix clause, and both the relative pronominal
567markers -karo and -kuto occur in all those examples. In the examples in (10), the object
pronominal marker -ro in n-apoko-ro shows that the headREL suto is object in the matrix
clause, and, again, both -karo and -kuto occur:

can also be marked for gender and number in ways that can potentially help to identify
the role of the headREL. Insofar as gender and number help to (indirectly) determine the
core grammatical relation of the headREL they function as redundant markers of the
syntactic role of the headREL in the ClREL.
In order to demonstrate how gender is encoded by the relative pronominal
markers, we can start by observing the gender of the headREL in (7) above, contrasting it
with the following example in (11). While in (7) the headREL is suto ‘woman’, which is
modified by the ClREL kuku karota-karo ‘who hurt the man’, in (11) the headREL is kuku
‘man’, which is modified by the ClREL suto karotakaru ‘who hurt the woman’. When we
contrast examples (7) and (11), where the headRELs differ in that one is feminine and the
other is masculine, we see that the relative pronominal marker agrees with the gender of568its respective coreferential headREL. The way this gender agreement is shown is by
alternating the last vowel of the relative pronominal marker, i.e. /o/ versus /u/:

V-rel.s ]ClREL
V
11. kuku suto
karota-karu
apo-pe
man woman hurt-REL.M.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘The man who hurt the woman has arrived.’
Analogously to (7) and (11), (8) and (12) can be compared to produce similar
results for the relative object pronominal markers. So, while -kuto in (8) was shown to
agree with the headREL suto, in (12) the relative object pronominal form -kutu is shown to
agree with the headREL kuku.

V-rel.o ]ClREL V
12. kuku suto
karota-kutu
apo-pe
man woman hurt-REL.M.O arrive-PFTV
‘The man whom the woman hurt has arrived.’
Finally, another piece of information about the headREL that is encoded in the
relative pronominal marker is the number. In the examples in (13) the clauses illustrate
the plurality expressed in the pronominal relative markers for subject and object,
respectively. -kanu is used for subject plural in (13a), coreferential with the plural
headREL suto-wako-ro ‘women’; whereas in (13b) -kunu is used for object plural, also
coreferential with the plural headREL sutowakoro:

The following examples in (14) are analogous to those in (13), and they have the
masculine headREL kuku-wako-ru ‘men’ coreferential with the plural relative pronominal
markers in the verbs. These examples are only given to show that plural relative
pronominal markers (both subject and object forms) do not encode the gender distinction.
That is, the relative pronominal forms -kanu and -kunu can agree with both masculine
and feminine nouns, as the examples below show; in other words, there are no feminine
plural forms such as *-kano or *-kuno.

‘The men whom I saw you didn’t see.’9.1.1.1.4Relative Clauses and the Polarity of the VerbIn order to illustrate the polarity agreement, we can compare the examples in (7)
and (10) with the following examples in (15). The first difference to note is the addition
of the privative marker ma- to the verb. As shown in 5.3.1, ma- is a negation marker that
forms descriptive verbs. When the example in (15a) is compared with (7), it becomes
clear that the relative pronominal marker changes its form to agree with the negative
marker ma-. The comparison can also be made between (10) and (15b) to produce the
570same analytical result. The way the relative pronominal marker changes is by alternating
between the polarity markers -r and -t, where the first marks positive and the latter marks
negative polarities:

]

15a. suto

man
PRIV-snore-INTR-VBLZ-REL.NEG.F wake
‘The man who does not snore woke up.’
Lit.: ‘The man who is a non-snorer woke up.’
Notice that, although polarity markers are restricted to descriptive verbs (i.e.
intransitive verbs that take object rather than subject pronominal markers), subject but not
object relative pronominal markers inflect for polarity. This is unexpected, since
descriptive verbs take object rather than subject pronominal markers.
9.1.1.1.5The Distribution of Relative ClausesIn analyzing the position of the ClREL in relation to the headREL (or vice-versa)
there are three possible outcomes. The first possibility is for the ClREL to precede the
headREL; the second is for the ClREL to follow the headREL; and, the third is for the ClREL
to occur discontinuously on both sides of the headREL. The labels prenominal,
postnominal, and circumnominal (or internal-head) relative clauses are found in the
literature (Keenan 1985:143, Comrie 1989:45-46) referring to ClRELs when they occur,
respectively, before, after, or on both sides of the headREL. These labels are used here in
the description of the distribution of ClRELs.
571In all examples of complex sentences containing a relative clause seen so far the
ClREL follows the headREL, thus characterizing the postnominal type of relative clause.
This constitutes the most common and, in an informal sense, the “unmarked” distribution
of the ClREL in relation to the headREL. Postnominal ClRELs are “unmarked” in the sense
that they are the ones naturally offered by the speaker when translating relative clauses
from Portuguese, they are the most frequent type, and, most importantly, because they
also are the ones most easily accepted by the speaker.2
Prenominal ClRELs are also attested in texts as well as in elicited material, as the
following examples in (16) show. In (16a) suto atama-nanu-ta-karu ‘who was looking at
the woman’ is the ClREL that precedes the headREL kuku ‘man’. In (16b) the ClREL is kuku
atama-nanu-ta-karo ‘who was looking at the man’ which precedes the headREL suto
‘woman’:

In the examples in (16) the headREL functions as subject of the ClREL. In (17) the
examples are illustrative of complex sentences whose headREL functions as the object of2One could argue that speakers may be influenced by Portuguese (wherein postnominal ClRELs are the only type found)
while translating Portuguese ClREL into Apurinã; however, speakers’ judgments of postnominal ClRELs are the same
when these clauses are presented to them in Apurinã. Moreover, a Portuguese influence would NOT explain why
prenominal ClRELs are disfavored/rejected in the same contexts where postnominal ones are preferred —as the
following paragraphs show.","[595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, 603]"
"9.1.2 Complement Subordination
Complement subordination is here defined as the process by which a complex
sentence is formed of two or more clauses, wherein one functions as the subject/object of
the other. Although complex sentences (and hence complementation) are less common in
Apurinã than, for example, in languages like English, two general types of complements
can be distinguished on the basis of whether they carry any formal marker of
subordination. In other words, complements can be described in terms of how
(dis)similar they are to a full sentence. Complements that carry no formal marking of
subordination and that, thus, resemble the most complete sentences, are described under
full sentence complements. Complements that carry a formal marking of subordination
and/or that are reduced forms of full sentences are described under marked
complements. A full sentence complement is to be understood as a complete sentence
that minimally has all the (morpho)syntactic expressions of the core arguments (i.e.
subject and/or object), where such (morpho)syntactic expressions may take the form of
the phrasal units described in chapter 8, section 8.1.1, or of the subject/object pronominal
markers described in chapter 7, in subsections 7.1.1 and 7.1.12. The constituent structure
of the clauses that realize a complete sentence was provided in 8.1.1.1, and the types of
these clauses were described in chapter 8.4.
The current description of complementation is more of a general survey of the
complement types found in the language based on their formal properties than an indepth analysis of each of these types. Further analysis on the behavioral properties of the
597complements and their sub-components is necessary, as well as analysis specifically
about the semantics of the complement-taking verbs. The terms used here to label the
semantic category of the complement-taking verbs (i.e. utterance, perception,
knowledge... verbs) as well as the semantic classification itself are partly based on
Noonan (1985:110-133).
9.1.2.1Full Sentence Complements
Full sentence complements are those that carry no formal subordination markingand that can stand by themselves as a sentence. Full sentence complements can function
as objects of utterance verbs, immediate perception verbs, and at least one manipulative
verb.
In the first pair of examples in (44) the full sentence complements (between
brackets) are direct quotations that function as objects of the utterance verb txa ‘say’: (In
the examples below brackets are used to highlight the complement of the sentence.)

that function as objects (again) of the utterance verb txa:598APPOS [ S V-o

As can be seen from (44) and (45a), there is no formal distinction between direct
and indirect quotation as a complement object of the utterance verb. The distinction
between direct in indirect quotation, however, can be made prosodically, with a longer
pause between the verb form and its complement for direct quotations. I should also note
that the utterance verb txa has one property that distinguishes it from other complement
taking verbs, namely that its complement necessarily precedes it. So, the following
example in (46) can be compared to the one given in (44b) to illustrate the property that
the utterance verb txa has of allowing only pre-verbal complement clauses. As shown by
both of the ungrammatical translations of the example in (46), this distributional
restriction on the complement of the utterance verb txa applies regardless of whether the
complement txa is a direct or indirect quotation:

The next pair of examples in (47) further illustrates full sentence complement
objects of utterance verbs, here with the verb sãpire-ta ‘to tell’:599S

The semantic difference between sãpire-ta and txa, is that the former is the one used to
mean ‘to tell a story’, but that, different from ‘tell’ in English, does not take a third core
argument. Otherwise, there is a partial overlap in the semantics of these two utterance
verbs. Moreover, the pre-verbal restriction on the complements of txa does not apply to
sãpire-ta:
The examples provided in (48) illustrate the immediate perception complementtaking verb etuka ‘to see’, in (48a-b), and a manipulative complement-taking verb akirita

Aside from the unmarked full sentences that function as the complement in theexamples presented above, there are marked complements clauses that carry the gerund
marked -inhi, morphologically described in chapter 4, subsection 4.4.7, and that
constitute the most common type of complement clauses found in the language. In 4.4.7
the gerund marker was described as part of the noun stem morphology; at the end of this
subsection the syntactic category of the verb forms to which -inhi attaches will be revised
on the basis of the syntactic properties presented below. Further distinctions among
complement clauses can be established on the basis of the formal marking properties of
their major components.
The first type of marked complement clauses to be described is one marked with
-inhi in the verb and whose undergoer is marked as object of the matrix clausal verb.
That is, insofar as the formal marking goes, these examples can be described as
constructions where the undergoer object of the transitive verb in the complement clause
is “raised” into the object of the verb in the matrix clause. The term “raising” (and its
derived forms) is with quotation marks so as to highlight the fact that the term is being
used here to refer to linguistic phenomena that only partially fit into the established
typology of raising constructions (as, e.g., the one discussed in Noonan 1985:68-73).
As the example in (49) shows, complements with object-object “raising” can
occur with a knowledge verb. In this example, -inhi occurs in the second clause to make
it a subordinate clause functioning as the object of the first clause:601s-V-o
[ O
s-V-GER-o ]
49. Ø-umarota-putu-ka-ro
[ããta u-kam-inhi-ro]
3M-know-EMPH-PRED-3F.O canoe 3M-make-GER-3F.O
‘He knows how to make canoe.’
In (49) ããta ‘canoe’ is the object of the verb u-kam-inhi-ro in the complement clause.
Although the presence of the coreference marker -ro in this verb would normally indicate
that ããta is the grammatical object in the complement clause (see grammatical properties
of the object under 8.3.1.2), there are two additional properties in the sentence suggesting
otherwise. The first is that, as shown in 8.3.1.2, it is a post-verbal (rather than pre-verbal)
object that is accompanied of the coreferential pronominal marker in the verb; and the
second is that there is also a coreferential pronominal marker -ro in the verb of the matrix
clause, thus indicating that ããta is in fact object in the matrix clause. One way to account
for the coreference marking in both the verbs of the matrix and the subordinating clause
is by postulating that the object of the complement clause has been “raised” to be the
object in the matrix clause, leaving a pronominal “copy” in the complement clause.
At the present time, this object-object “raising” analysis is a hypothesis that is
based on the formal marking of the objects in sentences such as the one illustrated above.
Further information on the behavior of the object in question is required in order to
demonstrate the viability of such a hypothesis.
The next examples in (50) illustrate complement clauses with -inhi attached to a
desiderative verb. In (50a) nu-serepi ‘my arrow’ is the undergoer and kuku is the
recipient of the verb marked with -inhi in the complement clause. However, the recipient
of the verb in the complement clause is marked (by the coreferential pronominal marker
-ru) as the object of the verb in the matrix clause. The undergoer serepi ‘arrow of’, as a
feminine noun, would require the pronominal marker -ro, rather than the masculine -ru.
602Moreover, as shown by the ungrammaticality of (50b), the marking of the undergoer
object of the verb in the complement clause as the object of the verb in the matrix clause
is an obligatory property of complex sentences with complements containing a
potentially ditransitive predicate. The example in (50b) is only ungrammatical because
the pronominal marker attached to the verb in the matrix clause is coreferential with the
undergoer (rather than with the recipient) of the verb:
s-V-o
[UNDERGOER O s-V-GER ]
[nu-serepi
kuku nu-suk-inhi]
50a. nu-nereka-ka-ru
1SG-want-PRED-3M.O 1SG-arrow.of(F) man 1SG-give-GER
‘I want to give the man my arrow.’
s-V-o
[ O
RECIPIENT s-V-GER ]
b. *nu-nereka-ka-ro
[nu-serepi
kuku
nu-suk-inhi]
1SG-want-PRED-3F.O 1SG-arrow.of(F) man
1SG-give-GER
(I want to give the man my arrow.)
One way to explain the marking of the recipient of the verb in the complement
clause as the object of the verb in the matrix clause is by positing a “raising” of the
“recipient” expression in the complement clause into the object in the matrix clause.
Here, again, although this “raising” hypothesis would explain the formal marking
properties involving the objects of these complex sentences, it would be desirable to find
additional information on the behavioral properties of such objects that would confirm (or
disprove) this hypothesis. Ideally, a more detailed investigation into the behavioral
properties of core grammatical relations should reveal further distinctions between
subject and object. However, it remains to be shown whether such additional behavioral
distinctions are actually found in the language.
While the types of complements presented above are analyzable as object to
object “raising” constructions, the second type to be described would seem to involve an
603equi-object-control deletion, where the object of the complement-taking verb and the
subject of the verb in the complement clause are identical. In this second type of
complement the subject of the verb in the complement clause marked by -inhi is
coreferential with the object of the verb in the matrix clause. In both the examples in (51)
the subordinate clause is a complement of the manipulative verb awirita ‘allow’, is
marked by -inhi in the verb, and its subject is coreferential with the subject pronominal
marker n- in the complement clause and with object pronominal marker -no in the matrix
clause:
S
V-o
[ s-V-GER ]
[n-umak-inhi]

kona
awirita-no
[n-umak-inhi]
be.thirsty-UNPOSS not
allow-1SG.O 1SG-sleep-GER
‘The thirst didn’t let me sleep.’
The third and last type of complement clauses marked with -inhi consists of those
that differ from full sentences in that they take the gerund marker -inhi and in that they
take a pronominal marker attached to the verb where such a marker could be interpreted
as coreferential with the complement itself, rather than with one of its arguments. In the
first pair of examples given in (52) the complex sentences have, respectively, the
commentative complement-taking verb potxita ‘like’ and the desiderative
complement-taking verb nereka ‘want’. In these examples the verbs of the complement
clauses are intransitive, they take the gerund marker as well as the bound pronominal
forms for first person singular subject. Moreover, the complement clauses in these604examples function as object of the complement-taking verbs, being marked as such with
the default gender marker for third person object, -ru, in the matrix verb:
S
V-o
[s-V-GER
]
52a. nota potxita-ru [n-okatsã-t-inhi]
1SG like-3M.O 1SG-fish-VBLZ-GER

]
b. nota nereka-ka-ru
[nhi-nhipoko-t-inhi]
1SG want-PRED-3M.O 1SG-eat-VBLZ-GER
‘I want to eat.’
It is important to observe that this third type of marked complements is
translatable into English as equi-subject constructions (i.e. where the subject of the
complement clause in deleted under identity with the subject of the matrix clause.)
Different from English, however, in Apurinã the subject of the complement clause is not
deleted, but rather expressed as a bound pronominal marker in the verb of the
complement clause.
In concluding this subsection, I must reiterate that the analysis just presented
above for the three types of marked complements is not intended to be a definitive, since
supporting evidence is still required to (dis)prove its validity. Finally, it would be
conceivable to posit a very distinct analysis where the marked complement clauses would
only be syntactically different from full sentence complements in that the latter lack the
gerund marker -inhi. Nonetheless, the fact that the argument of the complement clause is
marked as argument of the matrix clause needs somehow to be explained. What is
presented here is one possible account of such marking patterns.","[628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636]"
"8.5.1 Valence-Increasing Operations
In the following subsection the causative markers used in operations that result in
increased valence are first described.
8.5.1.1Causatives
As seen in 5.2.1.1.1.2, 5.2.1.1.1.5 and 5.2.1.2.1.4, there are three forms ofmorphological causatives in the language. The first causativizer is the class1 bound
verbal form -kũtaka, used with transitive verbs, and described in 5.2.1.1.1.5 above. -kũ
taka is illustrated in clausal context in (79a), where it attaches to the transitive verb nhika
‘to eat’; p-ita-ru ‘2SG-cousin.of-M’ refers to the one caused to do something (i.e. the
causee); yapa ‘“capibara”’ is what was caused to be eaten; and the subject marker arefers to the one who causes the causee to do something (i.e. the causer). nhika is a
bivalent verb, but in this example it works as a trivalent one as a result of the presence of
the causativizer: (In these and in other examples below, underlining is used just to
505highlight the causativizer, whereas double underlining indicates coreference between
double-underlined forms.)
O.CAUSEE

79a. hamo p-ita-ru

HORT 2SG-cousin.of-M capybara 1PL-eat-T.CAUS-VBLZ

HORT capybara 1PL-eat-T.CAUS-VBLZ-3M.O 3SG.M-AFFECT
‘Let’s make him eat “capybara”.’
The example in (79b) illustrates the fact that, in causative constructions, the
causee can be marked in the verb as the object marker. Thus, the NP-causee bears the
subject whereas the NP-causer bears the object grammatical relations. The question left
unanswered is what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is. In other
words: What is the grammatical relation of yapa in (79)? One possible analysis of this
third argument of causative constructions is to treat it as bearing an oblique grammatical
relation. The problem, however, of treating arguments such as yapa in (79) as an oblique
is that this argument is not structurally optional in the clause in the same way as other
obliques are in the language. Another possible analysis is to treat it as a secondary object
that is restricted to causative constructions. The problem with this second analysis is that
there is no independent evidence to treat such an argument as an object. The notion of a
grammatical object was defined for Apurinã over the possibility of a free expression cooccur with a coreferential object marker in the verb. As was shown in (79), the object
marker in the verb of causative constructions is coreferential with the causee and not with
‘what is caused to be V-ed’. Hence, either analyses have problems. In order to avoid
positing an ill motivated solution to this problem, I will choose to leave undetermined
506what the grammatical relation of ‘what is caused to be V-ed’ is in a causative
construction. I suspect that further research on the intrinsic properties of objects and
obliques in Apurinã will reveal ways that will help to resolve the issue.
The second and third causativizers have the same phonological form, -ka, and the
same function, occurring with both transitive and intransitive verbs. They only differ in
their affix position within the verb: One belongs to class1 bound verbal forms
(5.2.1.1.1.3) whereas the other belongs to class2 bound forms (5.2.1.2.1.4). In the
example in (80a) n- is the causer and amarunu ‘boy’ is the causee; in (80b) (repeated
from chapter 5), nhi- is the causer, -ru the causee, and yapa the object. In the first case a
monovalent verb is made bivalent, and in the second case a bivalent verb is made
trivalent:
O.CAUSEE s.causer-V
80a. amarunu
n-umaka-ka2-nanu-ta
boy
1SG-sleep-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ
‘I am making the kid sleep.’
causer-V-o.causee
O.CAUSEE
b. nhi-nhika-ka3-ru
yapa
1SG-eat-CAUS-3M.O capybara
‘I made him eat capybara.’
That the causee of an intransitive verb behaves as a grammatical object is shown
by the next example in (81). In this example the causee is anãpa ‘dog’ and it co-occurs
with a coreferential object pronominal marker, i.e. -ru ‘3M.O’, in the verb:
S.CAUSER V-CAUS-o.causee
O.CAUSEE
81. kuku
muteka-ka3-pe-ru
anãpa
boy
run-CAUS-PFTV-3M.O dog
‘The man made the dog run.’507Notice also that, as can be seen by comparing (80a) and (80b), the causer maps
onto subject regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive. On the other
hand, as can be seen by comparing (80b) and (81), the causee is mapped onto the object
regardless of whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.
Presently, aside from the transitivity distinction there is no evidence that other
grammatical properties play a role in the decision to use one or the other of the
causativizers. This may suggest that any such a distinction, instead, comes from subtle
semantic or discourse-pragmatic properties that are not grammaticalized in the language
—and which still need to be determined. So far I have not been able to find any
grammatical or discourse-pragmatic factor that can be used to distinguish the use of -ka2
versus -ka3. The co-occurrence of -ka2 and -ka3 in the same verb base does not occur in
natural speech. Only very collaborative speakers can sometimes accept the use of two
causativizers in the same verb base. Finally, notice that, as demonstrated by (80a) when
compared to (82), whereas the causer is always the subject (since the causer can be
coreferential with or expressed as the subject pronominal marker), never the object, the
causee is always the object (since the causee can coreferential or expressed as the object
pronominal marker), never the subject:
S.CAUSEE
V-causer.o
82. *amarunu umaka-ka-nanu-ta-no
boy
eat-CAUS-PROG-VBLZ-1SG.O
(I am making the kid sleep.)
Thus, the mapping between causer and causee and the grammatical relations borne by
their syntactic expressions further confirms the subject-object distinction, insofar as the508former always maps onto the grammatical subject whereas the latter always maps onto
the grammatical object.","[536, 537, 538, 539, 540]"
"8.10.6 Brief Note on the Discourse-Pragmatics of Constituent Order
Variation
No clear-cut association between the discourse-pragmatic status of the
information being encoded and the constituent order type used to encode such
information has been as yet established for Apurinã. In work still in progress, a textdistributional study is being developed following the methodology given in Givón 1983,
1988, 1992 and 1995. The preliminary results are still inconclusive, only suggesting that
a complex interaction of discourse-pragmatic functions beyond what Referential Distance
and Topic Persistence can describe, but for which such measurements can be useful
heuristic tools. One of the problems, however, with these preliminary results is that they
are based on a pilot project for which the data are NOT based on a representative sample
of text material. The results of a more representative data sample (on which the
frequency count described in the previous subsection was based) have not yet been
tabulated in terms of the Givónian text-based quantitative analysis and, as such, cannot
yet be reproduced in this work.",[589]
"5749.1.1.1.6Actorless Passive Relative ClausesAn actorless passive ClREL, as the label suggests, is the type of relative clause
that obligatorily lacks an actor and wherein the subject encodes an undergoer semantic
role. Insofar as the subject of an actorless passive ClREL systematically encodes an
undergoer, this ClREL resembles a passive clause. In order to illustrate this type of ClRELs,
let us first take the following examples of simplex sentences in (19) and (20). In (19a-b)
the first example illustrates a clause marked with the morpheme -~ka which, in some of
its uses, resembles a “passive” marker (as seen in 7.1.8), and the second example shows a
common simplex intransitive sentence. In the relevant context, the subjects of these two
sentences are coreferential:
S
V-pass
19a. kuku ketã-ka
man shoot-PASS
‘The man was shot.’
S
V
b. uwa
upũpe
3SG.M die
‘He died.’
In (20a-b) the first example is a common simplex transitive sentence, the second a
simplex “passive” sentence, and the subjects of these two sentences are also coreferential:
s-V-o
O
20a. n-atama-ta-ru
manhiti
1SG-see-VBLZ-3M.O deer
‘I saw a deer.’
S
V-pass
b. uwa
nhikã-ka
3SG.M eat-PASS
‘It was eaten.’
575In order to make each of these two pairs of simplex sentences into a complex
sentence containing a relative clause, it is necessary to make use of a special form of
relative pronominal marker, as the following examples illustrate. The complex sentence
in (21a) can be construed as a combination of the simplex sentences in (19). (21a) is
analyzable as consisting of the headREL kuku that is modified by the ClREL keta-koru ‘who
was shot’, and the matrix clause verb upũpe ‘died’. In a similar fashion, the complex
sentence in (21b) can be construed as a combination of the simplex sentences in (20),
such that this latter complex sentence consists of the matrix clause n-atama-ta-ru ‘I saw
it’, following the headREL manhiti ‘deer’ plus its modifying ClREL nhika-koru ‘that was
eaten’. Furthermore, the examples in (21c-d) are given to show that actorless passive
ClRELs do not admit an actor to be present in them. These two sentences are
ungrammatical because of the presence of the actor subjects kuku and suto in (21c) and
(21d), respectively:
S/O [V-rel.pass]ClREL
V
21a. kuku keta-koru

"5.1.1 Simple Verbs
A verb may consist of a basic or a derived verb form. Analogous to nouns (see
4.1 and 4.5.2), a basic verb form can be a free root (i.e. a lexical form that cannot be
analyzed into smaller morphological units and that can stand by itself as a verb) or a root
plus formatives phonologically attached to it. In (4a-b) we have examples of a basic verb
form. In (4a) the verb form arika ‘to set on fire’ consists of a free standing verbal root; in
(4b) the same verb form takes the bound pronominal formatives as the expression of the
arguments of the verb; (4c) shows that this verb form requires a nominalizer in order to
be a noun, and, thus, behaves as a form that is verbal:2744a. arika‘to set on fire’b. n-arika-ru
1SG-set.fire-3M.O‘I set it on fire.’c. arika-txi
n-atama
fire-NMLZ 1SG-look‘I looked at the fire.’A derived verb form can be made out of a noun, as in (5b), in which a noun stem,
karuwa in (5a), can only behave as a verb if the bound verbalizer formative -ta (described
in 5.2.1.2.1.1) is attached to it. The formative -no (described in detail later in chapter 7,
in 7.1.12) is one of a set of formatives that are restricted to verbs:
5a. karuwa‘a non-Indian person’b. karuwa-ta-no
non-Indian-VBLZ-1SG.O‘I am/act like a non-Indian person’The reason the derived verb karuwa-ta ‘to be/act like a non-Indian person’ takes the
object formative -no to express the notional subject (i.e. the argument that is expressed as
subject in English) is that karuwa-ta happens to belong to the class of verbs that
systematically take these object pronominal markers, rather than the subject pronominal
ones. This property of certain verbs will be described in detail later, under 5.1.1.1.2.
Also, analogous to nouns (see 4.1 and 4.2.10), a derived verb form can also be
made out of a bound root (i.e. a root that cannot stand by itself as a verb or noun unless
additional verbal or nominal morphology is attached to it) plus the verbalizer -ta. In (6),
it is shown that a bound root, nhipoko, cannot stand by itself as noun or verb without
further morphological marking. So, in (6a) the form nhipoko-ru2 ‘food’ is a noun; in (6b)
nhipoko is shown not to stand by itself as a noun or verb; in (6c) -ta is added to form the275verb nhipoko-ta ‘to eat’, and in (6d) the pronominal marker nhi- is added to the derived
verb form to express its notional subject:
6a. nhipoko-ru2
food-NMLZ‘food’b. *nhipoko
c. nhipoko-ta
food-VBLZ‘to eat (INTR)’d. nhi-nhipoko-ta
1SG-food-VBLZ‘I eat (INTR)’Therefore the simplest forms a verb can take are a free root (FRt), a noun form plus a
verbalizer, or a bound root (BRt) plus a verbalizer, as represented in (7):

FRt
N
+
VBLZ

7. V → 
BRt + VBLZ
The verbs can be classified in terms of their valence as transitive or intransitive.
Although the valence properties are more generally reflected in the syntactic and
semantic domains of a language grammar, certain morphological properties associated to
valence can also be found, and are described in the following subsections. In addition to
transitive and intransitive verbs, there are the auxiliary and presentational verbs which
show some grammatical distinctions that justify describing them in subsections of their
own, although they may turn out to be best as, ultimately, subclasses of transitive or
intransitive verbs.","[305, 306, 307]"
"283The verbs listed in the Table 2, however, are restricted to non-derived objective
descriptive verbs. As will be shown in section 5.3, the attributive markers pa- and kacan attach to root forms to derive objective descriptive verbs. Although a more
systematic study of the lexical semantics of objective descriptive verbs is required, I
should say that the semantic fields involved in derived objective descriptive verbs only
widens the range of properties referred to by objective descriptive verbs in general.
Finally, some of the verb forms listed in the Table 2 are the positive values of a
property; for these verbs, their negative values (i.e. their antonyms) are expressed as a
negation of the positive value. So, for example, the opposite of the verb hareka ‘be
good’ is kona hareka ‘be bad (not be good)’.
5.1.1.2 Transitive Verbs
Transitive (or bivalent) verbs differ morphologically from the general class of
intransitive ones insofar as only the transitive verbs can take both subject and object
pronominal markers. Transitive verbs are syntactically different from intransitive verbs
precisely in that only the former require the presence of both subject and object
simultaneously. Transitive verbs can be divided into regular transitive verbs and
(potentially) ditransitive verbs on the basis of whether their object can be marked by an
oblique marker or not. The example given in (4b) was an instance of a transitive verb.
Other examples are as given in (14), where nhi-, n- and nu- are subject pronominal
markers, and -ru is an object pronominal marker:
14a. nhi-nhika-ãpo-ta-ru
1SG-eat-RANDOM-VLBZ-3M.O
‘I went around aimlessly eating it.’284b. n-oka-ma-ru-ko
1SG-kill-FRUSTR-3M-FUT
‘I would have killed it.’
c. nu-taka-pe-ta-ru
1SG-put-pulp-VBLZ-3M.O
‘I put it (the fleshy thing) away.’
Solely in terms of their morphology, there is no basis for distinguishing bivalent
verbs from potentially trivalent verbs in Apurinã. The recipient argument of a potentially
trivalent verb can also be marked with object pronominal markers. So, the morphemes
-ru and -ro of the examples in (15) express the recipient of suka ‘give’:
15a. pu-suka-ru
2SG-give-3M.O‘Give (something) to him.’b. pu-suka-ro
2SG-give-3F.O‘Give (something) to her.’However, there are other types of differences between transitive and ditransitive
verb worth of note. In the next subsections I will describe properties indicating that both
regular transitive and ditransitive verbs can be analyzed as subclasses of transitive verbs,
under the definition of transitive verbs provided above. In distinguishing regular
transitive verbs from ditransitive verbs I will make use of the structural constituency
notion of “noun phrase”, which will be properly motivated later in chapter 8. For the
moment, “noun phrase” can be informally defined as the (pro)nominal free syntactic
expressions that are used to bear grammatical relations to the clausal predicator.
5.1.1.2.1Regular Transitive VerbsRegular transitive verbs are the most typical transitive verbs in the language,
insofar as they require both a (grammatical) subject and a (grammatical) object, wherein
285subject and object can be expressed as noun phrases, as a combination of noun phrases
plus the corresponding subject/object pronominal marker in the verb, or just as subject
and object pronominal markers. Regular transitive verbs constitute by far the great
majority of transitive verbs found in the language. In the following examples in (16)
(where underlining marks co-reference between the relevant arguments), the
(pro)nominal forms aõtu ‘umari fruit’, uwa ‘3SG.M’, maku ‘Brazil-nut’, and komeru-pe
‘manioc-pulp’ are all grammatical objects in the clauses they occur in; in (16d) the
subject is formally expressed as the pronominal marker a- ‘1PL’; and in (16e) both
subject and object are only manifested, respectively, as the pronominal markers a- and
-ru:
aõtu
16a. hãtako-ro apa-nanu-ta-ru
girl.F
fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O umari(M)
‘The girl is fetching “umari” (fruit).’
b. o-atamata-ru uwa
suto
3F-look-3M.O 3SG.M woman
‘The woman, she looked at it/him.’
c. maku
ata apa
Brazil.nut we fetch
‘We gather Brazil-nut’
d. a-makatxaka txa-ru
komeru-pe
1PL-take.out AUX-3M.O manioc-pulp
‘We take the manioc pulp out.’
e. a-makatxaka-ru
1PL-take.out-3M.O
‘We take it out.’
In the examples in (16) subject/object pronominal markers are only found in the verb
when the subject/object NP is either post-verbal or absent in the clause. I will discuss in286further detail the correlation between post-verbal subject/object noun phrases and
subject/object markers in the next chapter, in 8.1.1.
5.1.1.2.2Potentially Ditransitive VerbsVerbs that translate as ditransitive (i.e. trivalent) verbs in other languages behave
like regular transitive verbs in Apurinã insofar as only the subject and one object are
structurally required to occur, and the third argument is structurally optional (i.e. the third
argument can be omitted without making the clause ungrammatical). The examples in
(17) illustrate the general case, namely that verbs that translate as ditransitive verbs in
some other languages, in this case as ‘to teach’ and as ‘to tell’ in English, behave as
regular transitive verbs in Apurinã (parentheses indicate that the expression is structurally
optional in the clause in which it occurs):
u-sãkire
(pita-monhi)
17a. mipake owara-pira-ta-ru
Mipake teach-language-3M.O 3M-language.of 2SG-GOAL
‘Mipake taught his language (to you).’
b. nota sãpire-ta-ru
tsora sãkire
(youkake-monhi)
1SG tell-VBLZ-3M.O Tsora language.of Youkake-GOAL
‘I told the Tsora story (to Youkake).’As shown in (17), the argument expressing the “theme” is obligatory and occurs as the
object of the verb, expressed by a “caseless” noun phrase, while the recipient argument is
optionally expressed by an “oblique” noun phrase. For the present purposes of this
section, a “caseless” noun phrase can be informally defined as a noun phrase without any
morphological case marker, whereas an “oblique” noun phrase can be described (also
informally) as a noun phrase marked with an oblique (case) marker. The description of
noun phrases will take place under 9.3.
287There is one ditransitive verb, i.e. suka ‘to give (away)’, however, that differs
from regular transitive verbs in two main ways. There are two special properties to be
noted about the Apurinã verb suka that make it a special case of transitive verb: The first
property is that only this ditransitive verb allows a third argument (representing the
recipient) to be expressed by a caseless noun phrase. So, for example, in (18) a
comparison is made between the verb for suka and etuka ‘to look’, where the former is
the special case of a transitive verb (i.e. a potentially ditransitive transitive verb) and the
latter is the typical case of transitive verbs (i.e. a regular transitive verb) in Apurinã:
18a. nhi-yowata-ne
pita nota suka
1SG-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG give
‘I gave you my knife.’
b. *i-yowata-ne
pita nota etuka
2M-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG look
(I watched/looked over his knife for him.)
In (18a), where pita ‘2SG’ and nhi-yowata-ne (1SG-knife-POSSED) ‘my knife’ are,
respectively, recipient and “theme” arguments, both (recipient and “theme”) arguments
are expressed by noun phrases, whereas (18b) is ungrammatical.
The second special property of suka is that, while regular transitive verbs take a
single caseless object noun phrase, with suka either the “theme” argument, represented by
a “caseless” noun phrase, or the recipient argument, expressed by an oblique noun phrase,
can bear the object grammatical relation, as indicated by what the object pronominal
marker agrees with, as the examples in (19) illustrate:
19a. o-suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
3F-give-3F.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘She gave my arrow to him.’
288b. nota suka-ru
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
1SG give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave my arrow to him.’
In (19a), the verb bears a feminine object pronominal marker, agreeing with the caseless
noun phrase representing the “theme” argument nu-serepi ‘my arrow’. In (19b), in
contrast, the verb bears a masculine pronominal marker, agreeing with the recipient
object, which is expressed by the oblique noun phrase uwa-mokaru ‘to him’
(morphologically described in chapter 7, 7.1.2.4). That is, insofar as pronominal object
markers can be considered to be the major formal marking property of the object
grammatical relation in Apurinã, the object of the ditransitive verb suka can be expressed
either by the caseless noun phrase representing the “theme” or by the oblique (or
caseless) noun phrase expressing the recipient. In the interest of focusing here on the
properties that regular transitive and ditransitive verbs share or do not share, I will
postpone to chapter 8 (in subsection 8.1.1.2, where the relevant type of grammatical
relations will be presented) further discussion on what it means for the recipient or the
“theme” semantic role to be marked as object in the language. General constraints on the
structure of clauses with potentially ditransitive verbs will be discussed in 8.3.
In sum, the examples in (18-19) show that the ditransitive verb suka differs from
regular transitive verbs in two ways: First, only this ditransitive verb allows for a
recipient argument to be expressed as a caseless noun phrase; and, second, the object of
this ditransitive verb denoting the recipient can be expressed either by a caseless noun
phrase or by an oblique noun phrase. On the basis of the distinctions just described, one
might feel motivated to postulate that transitive regular verbs and ditransitive verbs
constitute distinct general syntactic types of verbs, types that would be as different from
289one another as are intransitive and regular transitive verbs. There are, however, two
important reasons to analyze ditransitive verbs as a subclass of transitive verbs in
Apurinã. The two examples in (20) have in common the fact that only two arguments of
the verb are overtly realized in the clause: In (20a) nota ‘1SG’ is the object, since it is
coreferential with the object pronominal marker -no ‘1SG.O’, and in (20b) the only
formal manifestation of the object is the object pronominal marker -ru ‘3M.O’:
nota
20a. pu-suka-no
2SG-give-1SG.O 1SG
‘Give away to me.’
b. nu-suka-pe-ka-ru
1SG-give-PFTV-PRED-3M.O
‘I’ve given away to him.’
Examples such as those in (20) reflect a common property of ditransitive verbs,
namely that they only require two arguments to be (morpho)syntactically realized in the
clause, the subject and the (recipient) object; that is, they are only “potentially”
ditransitive. The examples in (20) also confirm what was already illustrated by the
examples in (19) (and underscored in chapter 5, in subsection 5.1.12). Only one nonsubject argument of ditransitive verbs is required in a clause, and, moreover, only one of
the non-subject arguments can be coreferential with the object pronominal marker in the
verb. Thus, insofar as ditransitive verbs require only two arguments and insofar as the
free standing expression that can be in an object relation (whether a “caseless” noun
phrase or an “oblique” noun phrase in post-verbal position) can be coreferential with the
same pronominal object markers in the verb as those that attach to regular transitive
verbs, they can be considered to belong to the same general category as regular transitive
verbs.
290Aside from the verb suka ‘to give’, there is only one other verb, namely, sukare
‘sell’, that appears to allow the recipient to be expressed either as a “caseless” noun
phrase or as an “oblique” noun phrase, as illustrated in (21).
21a. aiko mipake sukare-pe-ro
suto
house Mipake sell-PFTV-3F.O woman
‘Mipake sold the house to the woman.’
b. mipa sukare-pe-ru
aiko
mipa-mokaru
Mipa sell-PFTV-3M.O house(M)-AFFECT woman(M)-GOAL
‘Mipa sold the house to the woman’However, the verb sukare requires further verification, since the data available still do not
allow a conclusive analysis about the formal marking of its argument roles. Although it
is clear in (21a) that the verb sukare can take a third caseless noun phrase argument, the
example in (21b) is ambiguous as to whether the pronominal object marker is
coreferential with the caseless noun phrase argument aiko ‘house’ or with the “oblique”
noun phrase argument mipa-mokaru (since both contain a masculine noun). One of the
problems with sukare is that it expresses a concept that has been fairly recently
introduced into some of the Apurinã communities, and, as such, it is not consistently used
across large numbers of speakers or across speech varieties. As will be seen in
5.2.1.1.1.3, some speakers simply add the intransitivizer -rewa to the verb suka in order
to express the concept ‘to sell’. It is likely that the form sukare is a lexicalized form that
resulted from the reduction of suka-rewa-ta into sukare, going through some process of
reanalysis that still needs to be determined. In terms of their most general use, although
verbs such as suka and sukare can take both a “theme” and a recipient argument, these
verbs are most often found with only one of these two arguments morphosyntactically
291expressed —exactly as expected from a transitive verb. Issues related to when the object
of a ditransitive verb stands as a “caseless” noun phrase or as an “oblique” noun phrase
will be addressed in chapter 8, in subsection 8.1.1.2. Some restrictions apply to the
clausal distribution of the noun phrases bearing an object grammatical relation; such
restrictions will be described later in 8.3.
5.1.1.3 Presentational Verb
Constructions used to introduce a participant in the discourse generally make use
of the verb awa. In its presentational use awa translates as ‘there be’, as indicated by the
following examples. In the examples in (22) the nominal forms i-ye sãko ‘this “traíra”
fish’, nhiki-txi ‘game (meat of hunted animal)’, and yowata ‘knife’ occur as arguments of
the presentational verb:
22a. sãko awa?
traíra there.be
‘There is “traíra” fish.’
b. nhikitxi awa-ka-sawaku
game
there.be-PRED-TEMP
‘When there’s game…’
c. apoka-koru yowata awa
find-REL
knife
there.be
‘There’s a knife that was found.’
Although the presence of the third person object marker -ru in (22a) would seem
to suggest that awa takes an object argument, there are other syntactic properties
associated to this verb which still need to be better understood. As the examples in
(22a,c) show, the presence of the pronominal marker in the verb is not a obligatory. The
exact nature of the syntactic arguments of awa and the factor(s) that determine(s) the
292presence (or absence) of the pronominal marker in the verb are issues which are still
unresolved. The reason for this is partly because I have not done yet a careful survey of
the syntactic consequences of the (sub-)meanings of awa. For the purpose of this work, I
will simply list these (sub-)meanings here and leave for further research the decision as to
whether they reflect semantic properties of different (but homophonous) lexical entries or
whether they constitute semantic sub-variants of one and the same lexical entry. In
addition to introducing presentational constructions, the verb form awa can also be used
as a main verb with the meanings described and illustrated in the next paragraphs:
awa used with a sort of existential meaning, i.e. ‘to exist, live’, as in (23):23a. popũka-ru-wakoru awa-ru
Apurinã-M-PL.M
there.be-3M.O
‘Apurinã existed.’
b. kone kariwa
awa-ru
not
white.person there.be-3M.O
‘White people didn’t exist.’
c. aiko kone watxa awa-yoka
house NEG today there.be-NO.LONGER
‘The house no longer exists nowadays.’
It is true that there is a clear overlap between the existential meaning of awa, as
illustrated by the examples in (23), and its presentational meaning, as illustrated by the
examples in (22). In both the presentational and existential scenarios in which awa is
used, the verb predicates about the types of existences of what is referred to by its
argument. A very subtle difference is that in the cases illustrated in (23) the predication
is about a longer (more permanent or stable) existence during states or processes, whereas293in (22) the predication is about a shorter (more short-lived, momentary, accidental, or
casual) existence during states or processes.
awa used with locative meaning, i.e. ‘to live in, inhabit, reside’, to refer to inhabitancy or
other place circumstances, as in (24):24a. nu-wãka-tu-kata
1SG-namesake-big-ASSOC
‘I live with my namesake.’n-awa
1SG-there.beb. nha-monhi-pa
p-awa-ru

‘Where do you live?´
c. aiko here-ri-nhi

‘The cute house where the woman lives in collapsed.’
d. uwã-ra
ata wai awa-pe-ru

‘Then we stay here.’
awa used with possessive meaning, i.e. ‘to have’, as in (25):
25a. nha-pakunu-pa p-ãtenekoru p-awa
WH-plus-INT
2SG-children 2SG-there.be
‘How many children do you have?’
b. n-awa-ru
epi kanawa
1SG-have-3M.O two canoe
‘I have two canoes.’5.1.1.4 Auxiliary
The auxiliary verb txa is used with verbal predicates, following the verb and
serving as the “host” base for some of the material the main verb inflects for, as the294examples in (26) illustrate. In (26a) the auxiliary follows the verb akirita ‘to call’ and
takes the object pronominal marker; in (26b), the auxiliary follows the verb atama ‘to
look’ and takes the object pronominal marker; in (26c) the auxiliary follows the verb
form yotika-xiti-ka-ta ‘burn-field-INTENS-VBLZ’ and takes no pronominal marker; and,
in (26d) the auxiliary follows the objective descriptive verb form hareka-ko ‘be.goodFUT’:
26a. akirita i-txa-ro
owa
call
3M-AUX-3F 3SG.F
‘He called her.’
b. pitxeka i-txa
komeru
grow 3M-AUX manioc
‘The manioc grew.’
c. ata yotika-xiti-ka-ta
txa
1PL burn-earth-INTENS-VBLZ AUX
‘We burn well the farm field.’
d. hareka-ko
pi-txa
be.good-FUT 2SG-AUX
‘Be good.’
The form txa behaves as an auxiliary verb in that it adds no meaning to the
proposition expressed by the clause in which it occurs, and it usually carries part of the
bound formatives that would otherwise attach to the lexical verb form. txa is rarely found
in elicited material offered by Apurinã speaker as translations of Portuguese data, but it is
very commonly found in text material. Presently I have not found any grammatical or
semantic factor that determines when txa is used or not, nor have I been able to find any
grammatical or semantic motivation for when a bound formative will attach to the
auxiliary rather than to the lexical verb. Except for rare instances, the subject and/or
pronominal markers will attach to the auxiliary form when this auxiliary is present in the
295same clause. However, other bound formatives are more often found attached to the
lexical base rather than to the auxiliary.
The form txa can also be used as a main verb with various meanings, as described
and illustrated in the next paragraphs:
txa can be used to mean ‘to speak, to say’ introducing (or not) a direct or an indirect
quotation. This is the most common use of txa as a main verb attested in texts and is
illustrated in the following examples. In the first two examples below, (27a, b), txa
introduces direct quotations; in (27c) txa introduces an indirect quotation; and in (27d)
txa simply takes an object:
27a. kuku-ka-ne-ra-no
i-txa
man-PRED-ALSO-FOC-1SG.O 3M-say
‘He said “It’s a man that I also am.”’
b. Ø-oka-pe-no-na-ko
i-txa
kema owa-mokaru
3M-kill-PFTV-PL-FUT 3M-say tapir 3SG.F-GOAL
‘“They’ll kill me”, the tapir said to the woman.’
c. kuku-ka-ne-ra
uwa
o-txa-ru
man-PRED-ALSO-FOC 3SG.M 3F-say-3M.O
‘She said that he’s also a man.’
d. akirita i-txa-ro
owa
call
3M-say-3F.O 3SG.F
‘He called her.’
txa can be used as a copula verb to mean ‘to be’, as seen in (28), in which case the
reflexive marker -wa is also found in the verb:
28a. owa-kanera
suto
o-txa-wa
3SG.F-ALSO woman 3SG.F-be-REFL
‘She is also a woman.’296b. uwa-kanera
kuku i-txa-wa
3SG.M-ALSO man 3SG.M-be-REFL
‘He is also a man.’
Finally, txa can also be used to make reference to the lexical meaning of another verb
(normally found in the preceding discourse). It can be roughly translated as ‘do’, as
shown next:29a. a-txa-ru
ata kitxekapirĩka
1PL-do-3M.O 1PL formerly
‘We did it in ancient times.’
b. i-txa-ka-ta-ru
3M-do-INTENS-VBLZ-3M.O
‘He really did it.’5.1.2 Verbs with Incorporated Nouns
Verbs can incorporate a noun form which occurs adjacent to the verb root. So far
I have only attested incorporated nouns with transitive verbs. The incorporated noun
form can either be a regular noun (i.e. non-classificatory inalienable nouns and/or
alienable nouns) or a classificatory noun. As happens to any other forms that occur as
part of the morphological structure of the verb, incorporated nouns need to obey the
morphological rules for placement inside the verb. What this means is that incorporated
nouns also have one (and only one) slot in which they occur inside the verb and, for
reasons to be explained under 5.2.1.1, the presence of an incorporated noun in the verb
requires the presence of the verbalizer -ta (described under 5.2.1.1). The simplest
structure of a verb with an incorporated noun can be represented as in (30), where the slot
for the incorporated noun is the first position immediately after the first root in the verb,
297as represented by the underlined space: (Recall that BRt=Bound Root and FRt=Free
Root.)
BRt
30. V → FRt  + __ + ta
5.1.2.1 Verbs with Incorporated Regular Nouns
Verbs with incorporated regular nouns are verb forms that incorporate a noun
which expresses a semantic argument of the verb inside which it occurs. That is, certain
nouns when used as a syntactic unit expressing the argument of a verb can also occur
incorporated in the verb and still have the same semantic function as non-incorporated
nouns. This is illustrated in the examples in (31) and (32). In (31a), tapo-txi ‘arrow’
occurs non-incorporated as a syntactic unit expressing the notional object of the verb.
The same noun form occurs incorporated in (31b), also expressing the notional object of
the verb. The examples in (32) follow an analogous pattern, except that in (32a) the nonincorporated noun is possessed whereas in (32b) it is unpossessed —i.e. marked with the
unpossessor marker -txi:
pu-suka-ta-no
31a. tapo-txi
bow-UNPOSS 2SG-give-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me a bow.’b. pu-suka-tapo-ta-no
3F.S 2SG-give-food-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me a bow.’32a. nota pu-suka-ta-no
pu-tou
1SG 2SG-give-VBLZ-3M.O 2SG-thing‘Give me your goods.’b. pu-suka-toi-txi-ta-no
2SG-give-thing-UNPOSS-VBLZ-1SG.O‘Give me the goods.’298The semantic propositions expressed in (31a-b) are exactly the same, since in both
examples the incorporated and non-incorporated nominal elements express the “theme”
semantic role of the verb. However, syntactically the incorporated noun constitutes part
of a compound verb base within which it (the noun) plays no syntactic role, whereas the
possessor agrees with the pronominal object marker found in the verb, as do nominals in
object relation to the verb.
In the next pair of examples in (33), the nominal form yãkunu ‘footprint.of’
occurs non-incorporated in (33a) and incorporated in (33b):
33a. n-atama-ta ru-na
kema yãkunu
1SG-look-VBLZ-3M.O tapir footprint.of
‘I looked at the tapir’s footprint.’
b. n-atama-yãkunu-ta-ru
kema
1SG-look-footprint.of-VBLZ-3M.O tapir
‘I looked at the tapir’s footprint.’
The semantic interpretations of (33a-b) are the same, since in both cases yãkunu,
incorporated or not, is the possessed element in the clause. Here, again, the incorporated
element plays no syntactic function and the possessor element is cross-referenced by the
object marker in the verb. Therefore, the analysis of these incorporated nominal elements
can be described as a result of possessor raising where the possessor element acquires
syntactic properties of the syntactic object of the verb. The types of verb incorporated
regular nouns given above are not intended to exhaust all the types of regular noun
incorporation in the language. Instead, they simply illustrate the presence in the language
of regular noun incorporation, which can be contrasted with the classificatory noun
incorporation.","[314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330]"

transitivity of the verb (as shown in chapter 5, under 5.1.1), semantic or pragmatic roles
of the subject NP. What would appear to constitute an exception are the objective
descriptive intransitive verbs, described in the chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2. If it could be
shown that these verbs have different semantic properties from standard intransitive
verbs, one could argue that pronominal subject markers are co-referential with arguments
other than the single argument of verbs with the semantics of object descriptive verbs and
other than the “patient”-like argument of transitive verbs. However, as was shown in the
previous chapter (in subsection 5.1.1.1.2.2), although the class of descriptive verbs shows
some semantic correlates, it cannot be reduced to a specifiable semantic class of verbs
and, as such, can be more generally characterized as a grammatically (as opposed to
semantically) motivated subclass of intransitive verbs, although one that strongly
correlates with property-referring concepts. That is, the fact that object descriptive verbs
475take object rather than subject as their single argument cannot be motivated on purely
semantic grounds, thus constituting no exception to the claim that the pronominal subject
markers are co-referential with grammatical rather than semantic relations, namely with
the grammatical subject. As a consequence, subject pronominal markers are a reliable
criterion that can be used for the identification of grammatical subjects in Apurinã,
although not all grammatical subjects in other languages will translate as grammatical
subjects in Apurinã.
8.3.1.2Object
The pronominal marking system can be used to distinguish the object from thesubject. As seen in various examples of previous chapters (e.g. 7.1.1, 7.1.12, and in
Tables 6-7 in section 7.3), the pronominal marking system includes a set of (bound)
object markers that is distinct from the set of (bound) subject pronominal markers. This
object pronominal marking is further illustrated in (50), where, e.g. in (50a), the
pronominal form that is suffixed to the verb, i.e. –i, is co-referential with the post-verbal
independent pronoun for second person singular, pite, expressing the undergoer argument
of the verb. The other examples below illustrate the same for the other grammatical
persons of the object paradigm (where underlining marks coreference):

As was shown in (47), the subject can also be an undergoer argument of a verb,
which by itself already suggests that a core grammatical relation encoding an undergoer
argument is not an exclusive property of the object, and, by extension, that grammatical
relations cannot be equated with semantic roles. This is confirmed by the examples in
(50) where verbs expressing from the least to the most “patient”-like meanings all take
the object marking paradigm coreferential with the independent pronominal forms.
Furthermore, to the extent that the single argument of (intransitive) descriptive verbs can
be accompanied by a coreferential object (rather than subject) markers (as was shown, for
example, in chapter 5, in 5.1.1.1.2.2) justifies treating the syntactic expression of such
arguments as bearing object (rather than subject) grammatical relation. So, the single
arguments of each of the simplex sentences illustrated in (51) (repeated from 12 in
4775.1.1.1.2.2) are all coreferential with object pronominal markers in the verb and, as such
bear object relation in these sentences:
51a. pooma-no
nota
be.hot-1SG.O 1SG.
‘I’m/feel hot.’
b. katsopu-ru
ũ-ũwu
be.white-3M.O 3SG.M-flower

c. pomama-ru
mãka-txi
be.black-3M.O clothes-UNPOSS
‘The clothes are black.’
d. mita-ru
aiko
be.big-3M.O house
‘The house is big.’
Also, as was briefly mentioned in chapter 7 (7.1.1.2.2), the (bound) object
pronominal markers can sometimes be coreferential with the undergoer and sometimes
with the goal argument of verbs that can optionally take a third argument (where “goal”
also functions as a macrorole semantically in that it includes “recipient” and “goal”
semantic roles, and which is properly described in 9.1.2.4). This is precisely what is
demonstrated in (52) (as highlighted by underlining). In (52a), the third person feminine
object pronominal marker -ru is coreferential with the goal NPobl, uwa-mokaru ‘to him’,
whereas in (52b), the third person feminine object pronominal marker is coreferential
with the undergoer NP, nu-serepi ‘my arrow’:
s-V-o.goal UNDERGOER GOAL
52a. o-suka-ru
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
3F-give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of

V-o.underg GOAL
UNDERGOER
b. nota suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nu-serepi
1SG give-3F.O
3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘I gave the arrow to him.’
The fact that either a NPobl or a NP can be coded in the verb through the
coreferential object pronominal marker (i.e., -ro (52)) indicates that the object of a
(potentially) ditransitive verb can be expressed either as a NP or as a NPobl. Moreover,
the only non-subject argument whose (morpho)syntactic expression is obligatory in a
clause with a ditransitive verb is the goal argument. So, in a clause such as (53a) the only
obligatory non-subject argument is suto ‘woman’, rather than kinharu ‘“buriti” fruit’:10
UNDERGOER s-V-o.goal GOAL
53a. kinharu
u-suka-ro
suto
buriti
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave the woman “buriti” fruit.’
s-V-o.goal GOAL
b. u-suka-ro
suto
3F-give-3F.O woman(F)
‘He gave (it) to the woman.’
Since the object has been defined over the object pronominal markers, it follows
that NPobl that are coreferential with an object pronominal marker bear an object
relationship with the verb. However, object has also been classified above as a core
grammatical relation, that is, one that is required by the lexical meaning of the verb and,
as a result, obligatorily expressed (morpho)syntactically in a clause having such a verb.
Hence, since the only non-subject argument required in a clause with a ditransitive verb
is the goal argument, it would be logical to conclude that only the (morpho)syntactic10I have found more recently that this is not true of all dialects, since in some of them the example in (53b) is479expression of the goal argument should be considered the object of clauses with
ditransitive verbs. So, in an example such as (52b), where it is the undergoer NP
nu-serepi ‘my arrow.of’ that is coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb (not
the goal NPobl uwa-mokaru ‘to him’), the question arises as to which element is the object
of the verb, the goal NPobl or the undergoer NP. I will maintain that the element that is
coreferential with the pronominal marker in the verb is the object in the cause, thus
postulating that object pronominal marking is the primary definitional property of
grammatical objects. That is, in (52b), uwa-mokaru is the object in the clause. This
question, however, about which element is the object of the verb only appears to arise in
elicited data, as there is no instance of natural spontaneous data where the undergoer
argument is expressed as a free syntactic expression that is coreferential with a
pronominal object marker in the verb. In natural texts, only the goal arguments co-occur
with such a pronominal marker. Instances of both goal and undergoer arguments cooccurring pre-verbally (thus, with no accompanying coreferential marker) is even less
natural and, perhaps, an artifact of the method by which the data are collected, i.e.
through elicitation.
On the face of the fact the syntactic expression of the goal argument can behave
(for the purpose of coreference with the object marker in the verb) similarly to the
syntactic expression of the undergoer argument in some clauses, but differently in others,
one may be led to describe the former situations (i.e. goal behaving the same way as
undergoer) as constituting instances of promotions of non-objects into objects. Although
such an analysis has been suggested for other languages in the past (e.g., Givón’sambiguous, being interpretable as ‘He gave the woman (to somebody)’ or ‘He gave something to the woman.’4801994:233-234 analysis of a piece of data from Machiguenga, another Maipuran
language), it would appear to be equally plausible to describe the marking syncretism
attested for goal and undergoer marking in Apurinã as simply following from what
defines object in Apurinã. In this case, the different ways in which objects are marked in
languages like Apurinã would follow from the same principles that motivate the different
mappings between semantic roles and the grammatical subject in various languages (see
Dryer 1986). In sum, the object in a potentially ditransitive clause in this language will
be the free expression of the non-subject argument that is coreferential with the object
marker in the verb; the third non-subject argument in the clause will be described as an
oblique, regardless of whether it is an undergoer or recipient.
8.3.1.3Remarks on Subject/Object and the Co-referential Pronominal MarkingPatterns
The coreferential marking patterns associated with the subject and object
pronominal markers and the arguments of the verb can be described as involving a type
of Split-S Intransitivity, where the single argument of descriptive (intransitive) verbs is
marked in the same way as the object of transitive verbs, and differently from the single
argument of (standard) intransitive verbs. Following the notation used by Dryer (To
Appear), the grouping of arguments into what is the grammatical subject in Apurinã can
be represented as follows: (Where ‘S’ = the single argument of an intransitive verb, ‘A’ =
more “agent”-like argument of a transitive verb, and ‘P’ = more “patient”-like argument)48154.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513]"
"45528a. o-apo-pe-ka
[kuku unuro]NP
3F-arrive-PFTV-PRED man mother.of
‘The man’s mother has arrived’
b. Ø-apo-pe-ka
[kuku uru]NP
3M-arrive-PFTV-PRED man father.of
‘The man’s father has arrived’
So, this property that nouns (such as the underlined ones given in (28)) have of
determining the inflecting properties of other elements inside the same phrasal
construction or clause can be taken to be one of the defining properties of a head of a NP.
The second is that various of the examples above also show that a noun (or pronoun) can
be the only element within a bare NP. The control of inflecting properties, then, can be
used to motivate the category head of a NP, and nouns and independent pronouns are the
elements that can head a NP. Hence, following the “head rule as internal structure test
for phrase class” given in (15), the presence of a noun or pronoun head constitutes a
positive evidence of a NP. Also, following the “internal structure test for phrase class”
given in (13), the presence of a numeral or demonstrative (as elements internal to NPs)
will count as positive evidence of NPs —insofar as wherever one finds a demonstrative
or a numeral, one will also find a NP.
In contrast to languages that require a determiner in order for the noun to function
as the syntactic expression of a verbal argument, in Apurinã nouns can stand by
themselves (without any determiner) as the sole nominal expression of a subject or an
object. In the following examples hãtako-ro ‘youth-F’, and ximaku ‘fish’ are instances of
nouns that can stand by themselves as the nominal expression of notional subject and
object, respectively:45629a. o-su-pe
hãtako-ro
3F-go-PFTV youth-F
‘The girl left.’
b. hãtako-ro nhika-ru ximaku
youth-F
eat-3M.O fish
‘The girl ate fish.’
c. ximaku o-muna hãtako-ro
fish
3F-bring youth-F
The girl brought fish.’
There are some preliminary indications that in some Apurinã speech varieties the
demonstrative forms constitute a subclass of independent pronouns, insofar as they can
stand by themselves as a noun phrase. If further investigation confirms the existence of
pronominal demonstratives in those speech varieties, the NP structure will need to be
revised accordingly for those speech varieties, since in such cases demonstratives would
constitute instances of pronouns.
One final note about subject/object/possessor NPs is that, as was shown in 7.3,
pronominal markers are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal (but NOT postverbal) coreferential subject/object (pro)nominals and with any coreferential possessor
(pro)nominal. Now that NPs have been introduced, this complementary distribution can
be thought of as involving subject/object/possessor NPs and coreferential person markers.
The examples in (30) further illustrate this complementary distribution:
30a. o-apo-pe
3F-arrive-PFTV
‘She has already arrived.’
b. *[owa]NP o-apo-pe
3SG.F 3F-arrive-PFTV
(She has already arrived.)457c. *owa o-unuro
apo-pe 3
3SG.F 3F-mother.of arrive-PFTV
(Her mother has already arrived.)
d. *o-unuro
owa
apo-pe
3F-mother.of 3SG.F arrive-PFTV
(Her mother has already arrived.)
In (30a) this form o- ‘3F’ can stand by itself as the sole formal expression of an
argument of the verb; (30b) shows that this same pronominal marker is in complementary
distribution with the coreferential independent pronominal subject; (30c) shows that the
pronominal marker is in complementary distribution with the pre-nominal possessor; and,
in (30d) the pronominal marker is shown to be also in complementary distribution with
the postnominal possessor. Insofar as pronominal markers can replace pre-verbal
coreferential nouns or independent pronouns, they behave like NPs. However, they are
NOT in complementary distribution (i.e. they can co-occur) with post-verbal NPs, as
shown by (28) and various of the previous examples. The complementary distribution
involving pronominal markers and a subset of coreferential NPs (i.e. subject, object and
possessor NPs) under the circumstances just described is relevant for the identification of
NPs insofar as it can be used to identify one important subset of NPs in the language.
8.1.1.2Oblique Noun Phrases
Oblique noun phrases (hereafter NPobl) consist of nominal forms that aremarked with one of the oblique markers which were morphologically described in
chapter 7, in 7.1.2, and whose syntactic function of the (pro)nominal expressions where3This sentence, however, could be grammatical if interpreted as ‘Her mother, she has left.’458they occur will be discussed in 8.3.2. Oblique markers are the bound forms that attach to
a (pro)noun to form a NPobl, as the examples in (31) illustrate:
31a. n-awa-ru
wai [[nota tanu-ro
nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl
1SG-exist-3M.O here
1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’
b. p-ita-ru
su-pe
[[ata nurumane awapoko]NP -mokaru]NPobl
2SG-brother.of-M go-PFTV 1PL relative
village-GOAL
‘Your brother has gone to the village of our people.’
As can be gathered from the two examples in (31), although the morphological “host” of
the oblique marker is always the last word of a NPobl, its semantic scope is the whole
NPobl within which it occurs, not the word base it is phonologically attached to. The
ungrammatical examples in (32) are given to demonstrate the fact that oblique markers
cannot attach to elements within a NPobl other than the rightmost one:
32a. *n-awa-ru
wai nota tanu-ro1-kata
nurumane
1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG spouse.of-F-ASSOC relative
(I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
b. *n-awa-ru
wai
nota-kata
tanu-ro1
nurumane
1SG-exist-3M.O here 1SG-ASSOC spouse.of-F relative.of
(I live here with the relatives of my wife.)
The examples in (33) show that a NPobl passes both the movement and
replacement tests for constituency. If we compare (33a) to (31a) we can see that the
NPobl can move as a unit; and if we compare (33b) to (31b) we can see that a NPobl can be
replaced by a single word, where both clauses (with and without replacement) have
related meanings in that they can refer to the same location/goal:45933a. [[nota tanu-ro
nurumane]NP -kata]NPobl n-awa-ru
wai
1SG spouse.of-F relative-ASSOC
1SG-exist-3M.O here
‘I live here with the relatives of my wife.’
b. p-ita-ru
su-pe
[werã]
2SG-brother-M go-PFTV there
‘Your brother has gone there.’
A valid question about what is being treated here as NPobls regards the extent to
which they are different from NPs and, moreover, whether such differences would justify
creating a new phrasal category rather than simply positing a new NP subcategory. In
terms of the structural definition given in the previous subsection for NPs, one could
argue that the following examples in (34) present a piece of evidence for not treating the
putative NPobls as NPs, where in (34b) a pronoun cannot replace the NPobl given in (34a):
34a. nota apo-pe
[mipa-kata]
1SG arrive-PFTV Mipa-ASSOC
‘I came with Mipa.’
b. *nota apo-pe
[uwa]
1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M
For all NPs seen so far it is the case that they can be replaced with an independent
coreferential pronoun. Thus, what is relevant in (34) is precisely the fact that, as shown
by (34b), NPobls cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun. However,
the ungrammaticality of (34b) follows directy from the semantics that the oblique marker
-kata adds to the NPobl mipa-kata, rather than necessarily from any structural distinction
between caseless and oblique noun phrases. That is, the distinction between NPs and
NPobls can be described solely in terms of their distribution in the clause that follows
from the grammatical relations they bear. So, as an associative oblique grammatical460relation (described in detail in 8.3.2.3), mipa-kata can only be replaced by a semantically
compatible “pro-form”, as illustrated in (35):
35a. nota apo-pe
[uwa-kata]
1SG arrive-PFTV 3SG.M-ASSOC
‘I came with him.’
Another possible argument for distinguishing NPobls from NPs in Apurinã follows
from its internal structure. As was seen in the previous section and summarized in (27), a
NP can precede a possessed noun. In (36) it is shown that NPobls cannot occur with a
possessed noun:
36. *nu-suka-ru
uwa
[nota hãke-ru-monhi] suto-re
1SG-give-3O.M 3SG.M 1SG child-M-GOAL woman-POSSED
(I gave it to the wife of my son.)
In (36), again the distinction can be argued to follow from the semantics of possession
construction rather then from any structural syntactic property of NPobls.
In sum, aside from always taking an oblique marker, NPobls also differ from NPs
in that they cannot be replaced by a coreferential independent pronoun, and in that they
cannot function as possessor. However, a different interpretation of the evidence
presented so far for distinguishing NPobls from NPs is that they follow from the semantic
roles denoted by NPobls, rather than from any major structural syntactic distinctions they
might have. In fact, the extent to which no crucial grammatical property is revealed by
how the distinctions between NPobls and NPs are categorized by itself suggests that this
may be ultimately a terminological issue. For the purpose of this work, I will continue to
treat NPobls as a subtype of noun phrases in Apurinã. Furthermore, as will be seen in the461description of grammatical relations in 8.3, there is a strong correlation between each
individual type of NPobl and the semantic roles they denote.","[486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"
"8The two examples above illustrate the type of test that needs to be done in order to show that grammatical relations
are distinct from semantic or pragmatic relations. Although, in principle, one should perform such tests for each type
of evidence presented for grammatical relations, in fact, this is not done here. Instead, in the following subsections I
only perform the test with respect to the most typical semantic role associated with the relevant grammatical relation,
making only textual mentions of the dissociation between a specific grammatical relation and its pragmatic role.
This can only be done here because the evidence in the language against treating subject/object as performing purely
pragmatic roles is so overwhelming that it would be redundant to repeat it for each time a property of a grammatical
relation is presented.",[504]
"4638.2. The Structure of Clauses
In the previous sections I have described the distribution and clustering of words
into phrases. In this section, the organization of clauses is described in terms of the
words and phrasal constituents presented above. The types of constructions that fit into
the definition of clause given in 8.0 are listed in the various examples described in the
following paragraphs.
The simplest type of clause will consist of a single word, where the referring
expression is a pronominal marker that is attached to the verb, as illustrated in (39a); or,
also, a bare independent pronominal or lexical NP plus a verb, as illustrated in (39b-c),
respectively. (39d) shows that a pronominal and a coreferential independent NP in postverbal position can co-occur. In (39e) a “branching” NP is shown to also form a clause
with a verb:
39a. [ [n-apo-pe]V ]S
1SG-arrive-PFTV
‘I have already arrived.’
b. [ [nota]NP [apo-pe]V ]S
1SG
arrive-PFTV
‘I have already arrived.’
c. [ [kuku]NP [apo-pe]V ]S
man
arrive-PFTV
‘The man has already arrived.’
d. [ [n-apo-pe]V
[nota]NP]S
1SG-arrive-PFTV 1SG
‘I have already arrived.’
e. [ [iye
hãtu kuku]NP [apo-pe]V ]S
PROX ONE man
arrive-PFTV
‘This one man has already arrived.’464The examples in (40) illustrate the types of clause structures that includes both a
NP and one or more NPobls, as immediate constituent of the clause:
40a. [ [uwa]NP [[suto]NP -kata]NPobl [apo-pe]V ]S
3SG.M woman-ASSOC
arrive-PFTV
‘He has already arrived with the woman.’
b. [ [uwa]NP [apo-pe]V

‘He has already arrived with the woman.’

g. [[suto]NP [o-nuro-kata]NPobl

h. [ [kukata]NP-mokaru]NPobl [suto]NP [su-pe]V [o-nuro]NP-kata]NPobl ]S
afternoon-GOAL
woman go-PFTV 3M-mother.of-ASSOC
‘Towards the afternoon the woman had left with her mother.’
(40a-c) illustrate the most typical positions where a NPobl occurs in a clause, and
(40d) shows that NPobls can be recursively used in a clause. (40e-f) show clauses with
both verb-initial and verb-final NPobls, where in (40e) the NPobl precedes a NP preverbally, and in (40f) the NP subject is replaced with a coreferential pronominal marker
in the verb. (40g) shows a NP preceding a NPobl pre-verbally, and a clause-final NPobl.
465Finally, (40h) shows a NPobl preceding a NP pre-verbally and clause-final NPobl. NPobls
preceding NPs are generally avoided in post-verbal position.
I should point out that, although the clausal structures with intransitive verbs
described here are the ones that are generally accepted by speakers of the language, some
individual speaker’s variation has also been attested. It still needs to be determined
which factors (grammatical or discourse-pragmatic) lead speakers to choose one or the
other of the various types of structures illustrated above. Moreover, the auxiliary verb txa
has not been illustrated here and, in principle, it can occur in any of these various
structures immediately after the main verb. It still needs to be determined also when the
auxiliary verb is used and when it is not.
The structure of clauses with transitive verbs is different (from that of clauses
with intransitive ones) only in requiring an obligatory extra NP or NPobl to express the
object of the verb. (37a), repeated below as (41a), shows a clause where both object NP
and subject NP precede the verb. The examples in (41b) (repeated from 38 and 41c-d)
are added to show that the two independent NPs of a transitive clause can precede or
follow the verb. As shown in (41c-d), when one or both of these NPs follow the verb, a
coreferential pronominal marker is added to the verb. Moreover, as (41e-g) show,
independent NPs are structurally optional when a coreferential pronominal marker is
found in the verb:
41a. [ [nhipoko-ru]NP [suto]NP [nhika]V ]S
food-UNPOSS woman eat
‘The woman ate food.’
b. [ [suto]NP [nhika-ru]V [nhipoko-ru]NP ]S

‘The woman ate food.’
466c. [ [nhipoko-ru]NP [o-nhika]V [suto]NP ]S

‘The woman ate food.’
d. [ [o-nhika-ru]V [nhipoko-ru]NP [suto]NP ]S

‘He called her.’ (2:48:A)
g. [ [o-nhika-ru]V ]S
3F-eat-3M.O
‘She ate it.’
The examples in (42) illustrate the distribution of NPobls in the clause, in relation to the
verb and to co-occurring NPs:
42a. [ [nhipoko-ru]NP [suto]NP [nhika]V [kikio-monhi]NPobl ]S

‘Toward the afternoon, with our family, she ate it next to me.’
The structure of clauses with (potentially) ditransitive verbs differs from that with
regular transitive verbs in allowing for a third NP to occur expressing the recipient
argument of the verb, as was shown in 5.1.1.2.2 and illustrated (17) in chapter 5, repeated
below as (43) (with brackets added):
43a. [nhi-yowata-ne]
[pita] [nota] [suka]
1SG-knife-POSSED 2SG 1SG give
‘I gave you my knife.’
b. *[i-yowata-ne]
[uwa]
[nota] [etuka]
2SG-knife-POSSED 3SG.M 1SG look
(I watched/looked over his knife for him.)
I need to point out, however, that examples such as (43) are rather unatural, as they can
be found only in elicited material gathered with rather collaborative speakers. As was
shown in 5.1.1.2.2, and illustrated in (19) in chapter (repeated below as 44), ditransitive
verbs behave like regular transitive ones in that they only require the subject and one
object to be (morpho)syntactically expressed in a clause:
44a. pu-suka-no
nota
2SG-give-1SG.O 1SG
‘Give away to me.’
b. nu-suka-pe-ka-ru
1SG-give-PFTV-PRED-3M.O
‘I’ve given away to him.’
Moreover, the same recipient argument that was shown to be expressed as NP in (43) can
also be expressed as a NPobl, as the examples in (45) illustrate:
46845a. o-suka-ro
uwa-mokaru
nhi-serepe
3SG.F-give-3F.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘She gave my arrow to him.’
b. nu-suka-ro
nu-serepi
pita-monhi
1SG-give-3F.O 1SG-arrow.of(F) 2SG-GOAL
‘I gave my arrow to you.’
Clauses with ditransitive verbs also differ from clauses with transitive verbs (and, for that
matter, also from clauses with intransitive verbs), however, in one particular way: They
allow for a post-verbal NPobl to be accompanied by a coreferential pronominal object
marker in the verb, as illustrated in (46):
46a. [ [o-suka-ru]V [[uwa]NP -mokaru]NPobl [nu-serepi]NP ]S
3F-give-3M.O 3SG.M-GOAL
1SG-arrow.of(F)
‘She gave my arrow to him.’
b. [ [o-suka-ru]V [nu-serepi]NP [[uwa]NP -mokaru]NPobl ]S
3F-give-3M.O 1SG-arrow.of 3SG.M-GOAL
‘She gave my arrow to him.’
In these particular examples in (46), it is clear that the third person masculine object
pronominal marker in the verb is coreferential with the NPobl uwa-mokaru ‘to him’ rather
than with the NP nu-serepi ‘my arrow’, since the word for ‘arrow’ is feminine in
Apurinã. The issue as to what it means for a NPobl to be coreferential with an object
pronominal marker in the verb will addressed in subsection 8.3.1.2.
The general structures in illustrated above, however, include types of clauses that
only rather collaborative speakers can accept and which have never been attested in text
material. Further research is required in order to determine whether any of these types of
clauses can be associated with specific grammatical or discourse-pragmatic functions.","[494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500]"
"271mean to describe is simply the one-to-many mapping between form and meaning which
is associated with some morphemes.
When referring to pronominal marking bound formatives as they are used with
verbs, I will use the term subject pronominal markers, so as to distinguish their use
with verbs from their use (as possessors) with nouns, and, also, to distinguish them from
the object pronominal markers (also listed in Table 1 above). The terms “subject
pronominal markers”, however, is more of a label used for mnemonic purposes, since, as
I will argue later in 7.1.1.1, subject is morphologically marked as a function of the slot
which subject pronominal markers occupy in the verb, rather than part of the function of
each individual pronominal marker that occurs in such a slot. Before analyzing the
syntactic properties of verbs I will need to introduce preliminarily the notions of
grammatical subject and grammatical object. The full set of properties that can motivate
grammatical subject and grammatical object will be presented in chapter 9 (sections 9.1
and 9.8), once all the required syntactic information has been systematically presented.
However, there is one basic property that will work for the purpose of describing the
syntax of verbs, namely that the grammatical subject is the syntactic expression of an
argument (of a verb) that can co-occur with a coreferential subject pronominal marker
attached to the verb. The grammatical object, in contrast, is the syntactic expression of
an argument (of a verb) that can co-occur with a coreferential object pronominal marker
attached to the verb. The co-occurrence of the subject or the object free expression with
its corresponding coreferential pronominal marker, however —as will be discussed later
in 8.2.1.2— is only possible when the subject/object free expression is post-verbal. So,
in (2a) -ru is the object pronominal marker for third person masculine object which is
coreferential with the nominal form ximaku ‘fish’, thus indicating that ximaku is the
272grammatical object of the verb in that clause. In (2b) n- is the subject pronominal marker
for first person singular subject which is coreferential with the independent pronominal
form nota ‘1SG’, thus indicating that nota is the grammatical subject of the verb in that
clause:
2a. ata nhika-ru ximaku
we eat-3M.O fish
‘We eat fish.’
b. yowata n-atamata nota
knife
1SG-look 1SG
‘I look at the knife.’
The full sets of both subject and object markers which is given in Table 1 will be
morphologically described in chapter 7, in 7.1.1 and 7.1.12, respectively.","[302, 303, 304]"
"434As to the object pronominal markers (described in 7.1.12), they are also different
from independent pronouns both in their phonological form and in their function. While
object pronominal markers can only be used with object function, independent pronouns
are used with subject, object or possessor function, as represented in Table 7:

phonological reductions of the independent pronouns. Furthermore, although object
pronominal markers are restricted to verb forms, they share with the subject/possessor
pronominal markers the special property of being in complementary distribution with a
pre-verbal coreferential argument expression —which, however, must bear the object
(rather than the subject) grammatical relation.
The best candidate for a special clitic among the special bound morphemes are the
oblique markers (described under 7.1.2). What is of interest to us here are the scope
properties of oblique markers. In the following examples the associative marker -kata
(identified in 7.1.2.2) is used to illustrate the general properties of oblique markers. In
the example in (59a) the construction nota hãke-ru ‘my son’ is shown to function as the
subject of the verb apo-pe ‘arrive-PFTV’. In (59b) it is shown that the oblique marker
-kata can occur attached to this nominal construction:43559a. nota hãke-ru2
apo-pe
1SG child.of-M arrive-PFTV
‘My son has arrived.’
b. hãtako-ro nota hãke-ru2-kata
apo-pe
youth-F
1SG child.of-M-ASSOC arrive-PFTV
‘The young woman has arrived with my son.
Notice that the semantic scope of -kata is the whole nominal construction nota hãke-ru2,
not just the last word in this nominal construction.
Examples such as these, however, do not constitute sufficient evidence that the
oblique markers are in any way words rather than morphological units. The fact is that,
for being a phonologically bound formative, they need to attach somewhere. The best
evidence that we could have would be to find a construction with a postnominal
modification, and see where the oblique marker would go. The only type of postnominal
modification found in the language are the relative clause constructions and, as it
happens, the oblique maker does go in the postnominal modifier rather than in the noun
being modified, as illustrated by (60) with the oblique marker -mokaru ‘GOAL’:
60. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3SG.F youth-F
3M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom she took away.’
However, although examples such as (60), where the goal oblique marker attaches to the
relativized verbal construction, can be found in text material, I have not been able to find
similar examples for other oblique markers. Even in translating examples from
Portuguese, speakers do not offer examples with oblique markers other than -mokaru
attaching to the predicate of relative clauses or complement clauses. This may indicate
that -mokaru is unique in attaching to deverbal constructions, aside from nouns and
436pronouns. Regardless if one decides to use the syntactic properties of oblique markers to
argue that they constitute special clitics in the language, it is important to recognize that
there is an important interaction between morphological and syntactic properties as far as
these markers are concerned. By recognizing this interaction we may be better able to
understand the sort of atypical properties of the word structure and/or atypical properties
of the clause structure. However, since Apurinã lacks any corresponding free form which
oblique markers can be compared to, it is not possible to show that the placement of such
markers in the clause is determined in any way by a syntactic rule different from that
determining the placement of corresponding free words.
Finally, an analysis of all special bound formatives as bound words which lack a
(phonologically) free corresponding form is, in principle, possible, though, as I will
suggest, undesired. Since all special bound formatives require a host base to lean on, and
since they all lack a corresponding free form, they all resemble bound words (except for
the still unclear “passive” marker). That is, (quasi-)floating special bound formatives
resemble bound words in that they can occur in two or more host bases; the object
markers, though constituting a non-floating special bound formative, resemble a bound
word in that they are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal coreferential object
free expressions; and, the gerund marker resembles a bound word in that it marks a whole
clause as subordinate, rather than just the verb itself, thus, in a way analogous to free
complementizers in some other languages. The fact, however, is that clear cases of
bound words were presented in chapter 4 as a subset of classificatory nouns. So, a
classificatory noun such as ku ‘seed, kernel; small and roundish’ behaves like a noun in
the language in that it can take a possessed marker such that u-ku [3M-seed/kernel] will
mean ‘its/his seed/kernel’. As was shown in chapter 4, only nouns can take pronominal
437markers functioning as possessors. However, ku is different from typical nouns in that it
can never stand by itself as a free word form, thus behaving as a noun that is
phonologically bound. Special bound formatives, on the other hand, can never take a
possessed marker.
On the basis of the description of special bound formatives as elements that are
integrated into the word structure, the structure of nouns and verbs given in (1-2), can be
revised as in (61). In (61a) N’ is the complex noun form that is formed of the nouns
described in chapter 4 plus the relevant special bound morphemes (SBM). In (61b) V’ is
the complex verb form that is formed of the (non-descriptive) verbs described in chapter
5 plus the relevant special bound morphemes:438N’

The next subsections briefly illustrate some formatives that are likely to constitute
additional instances of special bound formatives, but that, for being rarely used presently
in the language or for being restricted to one or more speech varieties, still cannot be
described in detail in this work.","[465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471]"
"279intransitive verbs take subject pronominal markers. An arguable difference would consist
of the fact that while the standard intransitive verbs can take the same morphological
forms as the transitive verbs (described in 5.1.1.2) —as long as such forms are
grammatically compatible with intransitivity— subjective descriptive verbs do not easily
allow these morphological forms. I use the expression “do not easily allow” because
there is a degree of variation across speakers as to which morphological forms can go
with subjective intransitive verbs. So, while the examples of standard intransitives in
(10) are perfectly grammatical, those of subjective intransitives in (11) vary from
somewhat acceptable to ungrammatical for different Apurinã speakers: (The
morphological forms used in these examples, except for the pronominal markers, will be
described in detail in 5.2)
10a. nu-muteka-nanu-ta
1SG-run-PROG-VBLZ‘I’m running.’b. u-muteka-powa-ta

3M-be.tired-AUGM-VBLZ‘The fat one is tired.’c. u-sãpaka-ãpo-ta
3M-be.tired-RANDOM-VBLZ‘He’s aimlessly tired.’It is the somewhat distinct behavior of subjective intransitive verbs in terms of the
verb morphology they take that has led me to separate them morphologically from
280standard intransitive verbs. As a result of the speakers’ variations in evaluating the
grammaticality of these examples, I have not reached any systematic results as to the
complete set of morphological forms that can or cannot go with subjective intransitive
verbs. At the present time I can only say that it is most likely that both semantic as well
as grammatical factors play a role in determining the difference between standard
intransitive and subjective intransitive verbs, and that a more detailed work specifically
on the class of subjective intransitive verbs is required in order to tease apart semantic
from grammatical (in)compatibility with standard/subject descriptive verbs. One of the
problems in accounting for the examples such as those in (11) is to tease apart cases that
are ungrammatical simply because they are semantically anomalous from others where
syntactic factors determine their (un)grammaticality.
5.1.1.1.2.2Objective Descriptive Intransitive VerbsObjective descriptive verbs are the monovalent property-referring verbs whose
only (lexically) required syntactic argument (when a free post-verbal (pro)nominal
expression) can (optionally) co-occur with an object pronominal marker attached to the
verb, but where such pronominal markers are used to express the notional subject rather
than the notional object of the verb. In the following examples the verbs hareka ‘be
good’, here ‘be pretty’ and pooma ‘be hot’ all take the object pronominal marker for first
person singular:
12a. hareka-no
be.good-1SG.O
‘I am good.’
b. here-no
be.pretty-1SG.O
‘I am pretty.’
281c. pooma-no
be.hot-1SG.O
‘I am hot.’
In the examples in (13) nota ‘1SG’, hũwu ‘flower’, mãga-txi ‘clothes-UNPOSS’
and aiko ‘house’ are all instances of object forms co-occurring with the object
pronominal markers:
13a. pooma-no
nota
be.hot-1SG.O 1SG
‘I’m/feel hot.’
b. katsopu-ru
hũwu
be.white-3M.O flower

c. pomama-ru
mãka-txi
be.black-3M.O clothes-UNPOSS
‘The clothes are black.’
d. mita-ru
aiko
be.big-3M.O house
‘The house is big.’
The semantics of objective descriptive verbs covers a wide range of physically
observable properties or sensations, as well as value. Table 2 lists a sample of objective
descriptive verbs and their corresponding semantic fields.","[310, 311, 312, 313]"
"591semantic role of its subject is converted into undergoer. The third column (and subcolumns under Polarity & Number) lists the morphemes that may mark cumulatively both
polarity and number. Finally, the fourth column (and sub-columns under Gender) lists
the morphemes for masculine and feminine. Notice also that, as is made explicit in the
table below, the major distinctions in the types of ClRELs can be described in terms of
distinctions of GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and Gender, thus producing tripartite
morphemic clusters. That is, at the same time that relative pronominal markers are
segmentable into three morphological markers (GRs & Voice, Polarity & Number, and
Gender), they also cluster together to function as relativizers.

-oWhen these tripartite morphemic clusters are contrasted to the way languages
generally mark ClRELs, they are found to be somewhat comparable to the relative
pronouns commonly found in European languages (Keenan 1985:149-152, Comrie
1989: 149-150, Givón 1990:656-658). Similar to relative pronouns, relative pronominal
markers in Apurinã occur inside the ClREL indicating the role of the headREL, and
functioning as subordinators. So, for example, the pairs -k-a-r-u/r-o vs. -k-u-t-u/t-o, in
Apurinã, and who vs. whom, in English, are both relative pronominal forms that occur
inside the ClREL, marking the headREL as subject and object respectively. The differences592between these two pairs are in their phonological status (as bound vs. free forms), in the
number of functional properties they encode (i.e. grammatical relation, voice, polarity,
number and gender in Apurinã vs. grammatical relation and animacy in English), in their
position inside the ClREL (i.e. following the verb in Apurinã vs. initial in the ClREL in
English), and, finally, in that only the Apurinã forms can also mark headless ClRELs.
Relative pronominal markers can also be compared with nominalizers, as the following
discussion shows.
9.1.1.6The Syntactic Category of the “Verb-REL” in Relative Clauses: Verbalor Nominal?
One final issue about ClRELs is with respect to the syntactic status of the verb of
the ClRELs as a result of taking the relative pronominal markers. (VREL is used hereafter
to refer to the verb of a ClREL.) In the description of the noun morphology in chapter 4,
relative pronominal markers are listed as relativizing nominalizers under 4.4.6. Since to
refer to the tripartite morphemic clusters marking the predicate of VRELs as both
nominalizers and pronominal forms suggests a misapplication of typical derivational-like
versus typical inflectional-like properties, some clarification is in order.
It is certainly possible for a language to make use of nominalizations to mark
ClRELs (Givón 1990:663-666)5. In Apurinã there are two major pieces of evidence that
the VRELs marked with the tripartite morphemic clusters listed in the table above are
nominalized forms: one morphological and the other syntactic. In the discussion that
follows, to say that VREL is “nominal” (or “deverbal”) or “verbal” means that VREL can5Where examples from Turkish, Ute and Lhasa Tibetan are cited.","[622, 623, 624]"
"420As was briefly mentioned in the previous subsection, of all the 14 position classes
occupied by the special bound formatives described earlier (7.1.1-7.1.14), only those
occupied by the oblique markers and the restrictive marker cannot be part of a verb base.
Conversely, only the gerund marker, the “passive” marker, and the object markers cannot
be part of a typical noun base. Although a more complete survey is necessary in order to
determine exactly which closed word classes can take any of the special bound
formatives, the preliminary evidence presented above suggests that all special bound
formatives that attach to a noun base also attach to one or more of the closed word
classes. For the purpose of describing the general distributional properties of special
bound formatives, these formatives can be presented in terms of whether they occur with
verb bases, with noun bases, with closed class word bases, or with a combination of these
bases. Table 4, where “other bases” refer to any one or more word bases that belong to
closed word classes, summarizes the information about the word category of the possible
host bases of each one of the special bound formatives:421Table 4: Special Bound Formatives and the Category of Their Host Base

+A general property shared by almost all special bound formatives, which is made
explicit in Table 4, is the fact that, except for the gerund, “passive”, and object markers,
every other special bound formative attaches to two or more distinct word categories.
Conversely, except for the gerund marker, “passive”, and object markers, no other special
bound formative occurs exclusively with one word category. Hence, out of 14 slots for
special bound formatives, 7 are found in with at least three distinct word categories, 4 are
found with two word categories, and 3 are found with one word category (namely, the
verb). The property that special bound formatives have of occurring with one or more
host bases of distinct word categories can be used to classify special bound formatives
into three types, as represented in Table 5. In this table, special bound formatives that
attach to host bases of three or more word categories are termed floating special bound
formatives; those that attach to host bases of at least two word categories are termed
quasi-floating special bound formatives; and, those that attach to host bases of one422specific word category are termed non-floating special bound formatives:

OBJECTTherefore, the general tendency is for special bound formatives to be floating or
quasi-floating rather than non-floating. On these grounds, some qualifications need to be
made about the non-floating minority subset of special bound formatives. Such
qualifications apply to the presence/absence of oblique markers in verb bases, to the
presence/absence of object markers in noun bases, and to the status of the “passive”
marker in the language. First, at least some oblique markers are found in deverbal-like
bases. Deverbal-like bases are the word forms that show both noun and verb properties,
and that consist of a verb plus the gerund marker or plus a relativizer. The examples
below constitute instances of an oblique marker attached to deverbal-like bases: The goal
marker -mokaru attaches to V-inhi in (51a) and to V-kuto in (51b):
51a. aiko
nota s-inhi-mokaru
house 1SG go-GER-GOAL
‘My going to the house...’
423b. i-txa
kema owa
hãtako-ro Ø-anhi-kuto-mokaru
3M-say tapir 3SG.F youth-F
3M-take-REL.F.O-GOAL
‘The tapir said to her, the woman whom it took away.’
A detailed discussion of the nominal and verbal properties of V-inhi and V-kuto will be
presented within the appropriate syntactic context in chapter 9, in 9.1.2.2.3 and 9.1.1.6,
respectively.
The second qualification to be made is about the presence/absence of object
markers in noun bases. There is a limited set of noun forms that take the object marker
when these noun forms function as the predicator in a clause. The examples in (52)
present instances of noun bases that function as predicators of non-verbal clauses, and
that take the first person object marker –no, in (52a-b), or the second person object
marker -i, in (52c-d), to encode the sole argument of the predicator:
52a. kiyomane-txi-nhi-pẽ-ka-no
elder-UNPOSS-AFFECT-PFTV-PASS-1SG.O
‘I’ve become old.’
b. kona hãtako-ru-ka-no

‘I’m not young.’
c. popũka-ru-ka4-ra-i
Apurinã-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re Apurinã.’
d. kãkutu-ka4-ra-i
person-M-PRED-FOC-2SG.O
‘Are you’re a (white) person.’
The third qualification, about the functional status of the “passive” marker, is that,
as was made explicit in 7.1.8, the grammatical function/meaning of the “passive” marker
may be undergoing changes in the language, going from a passive marker to a marker of
424a specific subtype of perfectivity. These changes, however, require a better
understanding. At the present time, the current data available do not allow a conclusive
analysis of the function of the “passive” marker or of the distribution of this formative in
terms of the range of the host bases it attaches to. That is, it still is possible that the fact
that the “passive” marker has been attested only with verb bases may be an artifact of the
data available.
Examples such as those in (51-52) would then seem to suggest that some of the
cases (of non-floating formatives) that are listed in Table 5 as possible exceptions to the
predominant (quasi-)floating property of special bound formatives would actually be no
exceptions. However, in the present work, I will maintain the exceptional status of the
oblique markers as well as of the object markers for two specific reasons. The first
reason is that the deverbal-like bases share both noun and verb properties (as will be later
shown in detail in chapter 9, in 9.1.1.6 and 9.1.2.2.3). The second reason is that
examples such as (52), where an object marker attaches to a predicator noun base, so far
have been attested in the speech of a single speaker. It is possible that examples such as
those in (52) are specific to a speech variety that still requires further investigation, in
which case it remains to be shown how representative such examples are of the
morphosyntactic properties of non-verbal clauses in the language. (Non-verbal clauses
are described in chapter 8, in 8.4.2.) Nonetheless, if the status of the gerund, “passive”,
and object marker turns out to be confirmed as non-floating formatives, they would still
differ from the typical affixes found in the language, even if only insofar as they occur
outside of typical affixes in the same way as do (quasi-)floating special bound formatives.
Here may be a good place to note that it is NOT the case that the distribution of
special bound formatives can be predicted in any obvious way on the basis of the surface
425syntactic structure of the language as it applies to free (i.e., non-phonologically bound)
word forms. In other words, although special bound formatives may occur most often in
a particular position in the clause, they do not occupy fixed positions, for example, at the
edge of phrases or clauses. Take, as a first example, the perfective marker -pe. -pe is a
floating special bound formative that occurs most often attached to verb forms. In (53a)
-pe is shown attached to a clause-final verb; in (53b) it occurs attached to a main verb
which precedes the clause-final auxiliary verb; and, in (53c) it attaches to a verb form that
occurs clause initially:
53a. oposo uwa
kema anhika
txa-pe-ro
PTC 3SG.M tapir take.away AUX-PFTV-3F.O
‘So, the tapir, it took her away.’
b. oposo uwa-kata
su-pe
o-txa
PTC 3SG.M-ASSOC go-PFTV 3F-AUX-PFTV
‘Then she went with it.’
c. ĩ-imata-pe-ro
owa
3M-mate-PFTV-3F.O 3SG.F
‘It had intercourse with her.’
As an instance of a non-floating special bound formative, take the gerund marker
-inhi. -inhi is non-floating because it attaches only to verb bases, as was shown in 0. As
the examples in (54) illustrate, -inhi can occur in host verb bases that are in clause-final,
clause-medial or clause-initial position:
54a. i-ye
komeru i-ye
katarokuru a-kam-inhi
M-PROX manioc M-PROX manioc.flour 1PL-make-GER
‘…our making of this manioc and of this manioc flour.’
b. nh-ita-ru

n-ũpu

1SG-cousin.of-M 1SG-remember-GER-INSTR 1SG-come here-GOAL
‘In remembering of my cousin, I came here.’
426c. a-yana-poko-t-inhi
uwã
1PL-walk-DISTR-VBLZ-GER there
‘Our visiting around there...’
However, although examples such as (54c) can be attested in spontaneous discourse, it is
the case that the verb base taking -inhi rarely occurs clause initially. That is, the norm is
for -inhi to occur with host bases in clause-medial or clause-final position. This
“dispreference” for the clause initial position is most likely to follow from two properties
of the gerund marker: First,-inhi generally functions as a marker of subordinated clause
(as will be shown in chapter 9, under 9.1), and it happens that Apurinã subordinate
clauses tend to follow rather than precede the matrix clause. Second, -inhi attaches to
verb bases and, as it happens, verbs normally occur in clause—medial or in clause-final
position —when one or more free argument expression(s) is/are found in the clause (as
will be shown in chapter 8, in 8.9.5). Hence, the “dispreference” for clause-initial
position for the host base -inhi to attach to is a by-product of the functional properties of
-inhi as well as of the distributional properties of its host verb base, NOT the result of any
syntactic rule applying to -inhi itself.
As an instance of a quasi-floating special bound formative, take the restrictive
marker -nanu. As (55) illustrates, -nanu occurs with (pro)nominal host bases that are in
clause-initial or in clause-medial position:
watxa ata nhi-pe
55a. a-serota-re-nanu-ra
1PL-salt-POSSED-RESTR-FOC today 1PL eat-PFTV
‘Nowadays (it’s) only with salt that we eat.’
b. uwa-nanu

apa-monhika-ãpo-ta
fetch-GOAL-RANDOM-VBLZ
‘…it was only the language of the elders that we’d go about learning.’
In contrast to the gerund marker, the restrictive marker simply does not occur (in text
material) in host bases that are in clause-final position. This restriction, however, again is
more likely to follow from the meaning properties of the restrictive marker, rather than
from a purely syntactic constraint on its distribution. -nanu individualizes the referential
properties of the (pro)nominal base it attaches too roughly in the same way that the word
only, just and alone do in English. In doing so, -nanu restricts the application of the
meaning conveyed by the predicator of the clause and highlights the importance of the
referent expressed by the (pro)nominal base which -nanu attaches to. Thus, the
“dispreference” for clause-final position is likely to follow from the discourse-pragmatic
properties associated with -nanu. Analogous discourse-pragmatic properties can be more
easily shown to play a role in the placement of the focus of attention marker, -ra
(described in 7.1.11). -ra is a floating special bound formative whose function is to bring
the focus of attention onto the word base to which it attaches. Thus, the
function/meaning of -ra is clearly a discourse one. As it happens, the host bases to which
-ra attaches show strong preference for clause-initial position, although it can sometimes
occur clause-medially. The examples in (56) illustrate the distribution of -ra:

DISC.PTC 3SG.M-ASSOC-FRUSTR-FOC-FUT 1PL-go-FRUSTR
‘Then it would be with him that we’d go.’
-ra occurs in the first word in the clause in (56a, c). Notice that, as it is clear in (56b, d),
the actual preference is not for -ra to occur in the first word; instead, the strong
preference is for the phrasal constituent (rather than simply the word form) with which
-ra occurs to be positioned clause-initially. Moreover, as illustrated in (56e-f), when the
phrasal constituents in which -ra is found do occur clause-medially, these phrasal
constituents are generally preceded by a clause-initial discourse particle —which do not
constitute constituents of the clause. (A detailed discussion of constituent structure will
be presented in chapter 8, in 8.1-2) Here, again the strong preference for a specific
position inside the clause is not necessarily determined by any syntactic constraint but,
instead, it follows from the meaning and functional properties of the special formative in
question. In the case of -ra, it makes perfect sense (from a discourse and cognitive
perspective) to place in the beginning of the clause the construction whose focus of
attention is called for.
429One last important aspect of the distribution of special bound formatives in the
clause is that at least some of them can occur more than once in different host bases in the
same clausal construction —in a way reminiscent of agreement markers in other
languages. It is this repetition of the same special bound formative in the same clausal
construction that is illustrated by the examples in (57): (Repeated forms are underlined in
these examples.)

the occurrence of both frustrative and the future markers in an associative expression and
in a verb form. Finally, (57d-e) illustrate, respectively, the occurrence of the perfective
and the predicate markers both in the main verb and in the auxiliary forms. No case has
been attested where the same special bound form occurs both in a verb form and in its
430expression of its object. Also, no case has been attested of the same special bound
formative being used both in the possessor and in the possessed forms in the same
possession construction. Exactly what the factors determining if/when a special bound
formative can or cannot be repeated in a clausal construction still needs to be determined.
Nevertheless, there is no indication that there is any grammatical factor(s) that is/are
systematically associated with the agreement-like property of some special bound
formatives. In fact, the repetition of the same special bound formative within a syntactic
construction is structurally optional, and, most likely, is motivated by discoursepragmatic factors still to be determined. Nevertheless, regardless of what the motivating
factors are, the fact that some special bound formatives can be repeated in the same
construction constitutes an important distinction between these special bound formatives
and any of the affix forms described in the previous chapters.","[451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"
"585However, although non-verbal ClRELs of the type illustrated in (35) can be found
both in elicited as well as in text material, it is more common (both in elicited and text
material) for clauses with non-verbal predicators to make use of the verb form inha
(briefly mentioned in 9.1.1.1, in association with ClRELs with descriptive verb
predicators). In (36a) suto is the headREL that is modified by ClREL popũka-ro
inha-karo-wa ‘who is Apurinã’. In (36b) amarunu ‘child’ is the headREL that is modified
by the ClREL suto-nhi inha-karo-wa ‘who is woman’:

Lit.:‘The child who was a woman died.’
Notice that in while in (36a) the reflexive marker -wa occurs attached to the verb form,
no such a marker is found in (36b). Although the reflexive marker is often found in these
types of nominal ClRELs, its presence is structurally optional and is likely to be
conditioned by discourse-pragmatic factors which, however, remain to be determined.
As the examples in (36) show, non-verbal ClRELs are marked with the subject
relative pronominal markers plus, in some cases, the reflexive marker. Therefore, both
the strategies used for relativizing clauses with descriptive verbs and for relativizing
clauses with non-descriptive verbs can be used with clauses with non-verbal predicators.
That is, simplex sentences with non-verbal predicators can either take no formal marker
586when embedded as a ClREL in a complex sentence (as in 35), or they can make use of the
verb form inha plus the subject relative pronominal marker (as in 36). The verb form
inha is only found in ClRELs with descriptive verbs (as shown in 9.1.1.1) or non-verbal
predicators. Although inha can be described in this work as a copula verb that is
restricted to certain ClRELs, it is possible (as mentioned in 9.1.1.1) that more data will
show that some uses of it can be best described as an auxiliary verb that is restricted to a
subset of ClRELs. Finally, so far there is no evidence of any grammatical factor that may
condition the presence versus absence of inha in the ClRELs in which they can occur.
9.1.1.4Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses
Non-restrictive relative clauses are generally defined in other languages asClRELs that do not constrain the headREL, and whose headRELs are “fully specified, definite
NPs such as proper nouns” (Keenan 1985:169); as ClRELs that add information “about an
already identified entity, but not to identify that entity” (Comrie 1989:138); or, as ClRELs
encoding a “proposition [that] tends NOT to be presupposed” (Givón 1990:649). On the
basis of these definitions, we would like to then find an example of a complex clause
formed out of the combination of sentences such as the ones given in (37). In (37) both
simplex sentences have a common argument, kayãparo, which is a proper noun:
37a. kayãparo nu-suto-re
Kayãparo 1SG-woman-POSSED
‘Kayãparo is my wife.’
S
V
b. kayãparo apo-pe
Kayãparo arrive-PFTV
‘Kayãparo has arrived.’587The combination of these two simplex sentences into a complex one produces the
sentence in (38). In (38) kayãparo ‘name of a woman’ is the headREL that is modified by
the ClREL nu-suto-re inhakaro ‘who is my wife’. The headREL kayãparo, as a proper
noun, is a fully specified, identified, NP, and the information expressed by the ClREL is
not presupposed. What this example then shows is that non-restrictive ClRELs make use
of the same formal marking strategy as restrictive ClRELs; that is, both restrictive and nonrestrictive ClRELs are marked with relative pronominal markers:
S/UNDERGOER [
O
V-rel.s]
V
38. kayãparo
nu-suto-re
inha-karo
apo-pe
Kayãparo
1SG-woman-POSSED be-REL.SG.F.POS.S arrive-PFTV
‘Kayãparo, my wife, has arrived.’
Lit.: ‘Kayãparo, who’s my wife, has arrived.’
However, non-restrictive ClRELs, by definition, also allow for certain ClRELs that
are unlikely to be encoded as restrictive ClRELs. For example, aside from proper nouns,
non-restrictive ClRELs, in principle, also allow for pronouns to be relativized. In fact, in
Apurinã, the relativization of pronouns is more than a logical possibility, as the examples
in (39) illustrate. In (39a-e) all independent pronouns (with the exception of third person
singular) are “modified” by a ClREL. Although there is nothing special about the
relativization of pronouns per se, it is surprising (based on what has been shown so far) to
find that these pronouns are accompanied of a coreferential OBJECT pronominal marker
(highlighted with double underlining in 39a-c) on the verb, in addition to the relative
pronominal markers that themselves are also coreferential (in gender) with the headREL
pronouns:588S/S [ V-rel.s-o

The problem is not so much in having coreference marked twice in the same
ClREL, but that there is a conflict in what the coreference is marked for. The relative
pronominal markers -karu and -kanu are also SUBJECT markers (as shown in 9.1.1.1.2),
whereas the bound pronominal forms following the relativizers are OBJECT markers (as
shown in 5.1 and 7.1.1.2). Aside from marking object, the bound pronominal markers
found in the examples in (39) also add another parameter of coreference, namely person
marking. The following paragraphs present two partial accounts of the data in (39), in an
attempt to explain what appears to be conflicting markings for core grammatical relations
in non-restrictive ClRELs.
One first possible account of the presence of the bound pronominal markers in
non-restrictive ClRELs is that they are also “present” in restrictive ClRELs, and that it
589simply happens that restrictive ClRELs by definition modify headRELs in third person. In
this account the assumption is that the marker for third person in ClRELs is not audible
phonologically (or, in other words, is not morphologically marked). One potential
problem with this account is that not only the marker for third person but also the one for
second person plural will be not audible phonologically (or is not morphologically
marked) —a potential but not critical problem. On this account, restrictive and nonrestrictive ClRELs are NOT distinguishable syntactically. The following example in (40),
where the headREL is a third person independent pronoun, supports this first account. In
this example, a non-restrictive ClREL “modifies” an identifiable NP, and there is no formal
difference between this non-restrictive ClREL and the comparable restrictive ClRELs seen
so far:
S/S [ V-rel.s-o ]
V-o

40. owa
okatsããta-karo kona nhika-ika-ru
ximaku
3SG.F fish-REL.SG.F.S not eat-ANYMORE-3M.O fish
‘She, who did fishing, did not eat fish anymore.’
Another possible account of the data in (39) is that person markers are restricted
to non-restrictive ClRELs, and the morphological distinction between the two follows from
the semantics and discourse-pragmatics inherent to both types of relative clauses. Even
in this second account, however, restrictive and non-restrictive ClRELs can be considered
as non-distinguishable syntactically, since their only formal marking distinction follows
from non-syntactic properties they have. This second account would work in the same
way as the first one, except that there would be no null morpheme for third person in
restrictive relatives clauses. So, in (40), third person would be null or unmarked in the
verb.
590Either of the accounts in the foregoing discussion provides a motivation to find
the person markers in the data in (39). What these accounts, nonetheless, do not explain
is why such person markers mark object rather than subject, if the latter is what is marked
in the relative pronominal markers. This latter question is dealt with in the next section.
To finalize the discussion on non-restrictive ClRELs, I should add that, as far as I
have been able to observe, no evidence of a pause preceding and/or following nonrestrictive ClRELs has been detected so far. Nonetheless, it would not surprise me to find
Apurinã speakers with higher proficiency in Portuguese (than in Apurinã) making use of
such a prosodic strategy to distinguish non-restrictive from restrictive ClRELs —since this
strategy is available for speakers of Portuguese.
9.1.1.5Relative Pronominal Markers as Tripartite Morphemic Clusters
Now that all the syntactic distinctions found in ClRELs have been described, theglossing of the various relative pronominal markers given in Table 1 earlier in the chapter
can be finally revised into a more detailed morphemic description, such as the one
provided in Table 2. In this table the first column shows the types of ClRELs that can be
distinguished on the basis of the grammatical role of the headREL in the ClREL and on the
basis of how the headREL is affected by the presence of the coreferential relative
pronominal marker in the verb. 4 The second column (and sub-columns under GRs &
Voice, where GRs=Core Grammatical Relations) lists the bi-phonemic morphemes that
mark whether the headREL is subject, object, or whether the ClREL is actorless or the4The fact that all markers of grammatical relations and voice in ClRELs start with -k may be used to argue that -k is
also a morpheme —for example, a marker of relativization. I have chosen to analyze -k as part of the markers of
grammatical relations and voice so as to reduce the number of ambiguities which is already very large even in the
current morpheme breaking used here.","[616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622]"
"7.3. The Category Status of Special Bound Formatives
The purpose of this subsection is to discuss the arguments to be constructed on the
basis of the data presented so far (but not yet systematically discussed as to what they
mean) for treating special bound formatives as a special category of morphological units.
While such special morphological units can be shown to resemble the more typical affix
units (as the ones described in chapters 4-6) in terms of their distribution in the base they
attach to, they can, nonetheless, be distinguished from typical affixes in at least two
ways: first, in terms of their positioning outside of the more typical affixal morphology
described in chapters 4-6, and, second in terms of their “floating” distribution in the
clause and/or the way in which they interact with phrasal or clausal constructions. The431analysis of the status of special bound formatives as an extension of morphological
strategies (rather than as a result of purely syntactic operations) has a twofold motivation:
On the one hand, it follows from my perception of a general trend in Apurinã, namely to
make use of morphological strategies to encode functions that apply at the level of the
phrase or clause; and, on the other hand, it is partly inspired in Anderson (1992, and
references there cited, especially chapter 8) —although I do not make use of the formal
descriptive language nor necessarily of all axioms that accompany that framework. The
discussions in chapter 8 of Spencer 1991 and in chapter 3 of Sadock 1991 were also
helpful in organizing the content of this section.
I have so far intentionally avoided making use of the term “clitics” here due to the
various meanings associated with it, and have chosen instead to work with languagespecific labels. As a consequence, the distinctions being made here are clearly motivated
by language internal factors. After all, as Sadock points out, “[t]he elements we call
clitics are often characterized by a constellation of properties from diverse grammatical
realms”, among which he lists the following:
58. Sample of wide range of properties associated with clitics, as given by Sadock (1991:52):
“I. Morphology
a. Clitics are bound morphemes.
b. They attach outside inflection.
c. They block further morphology.
d. They attach without regard to the morphological class of the host.
e. They are completely productive.
II. Syntax
a. Clitics are independent elements of syntax.
b. They are syntactically adjacent to their morphological host.
III. Semantics
a. Clitics are semantic functions.
b. They take the meaning of a phrase as argument.
IV. Phonology
a. Clitics are phonologically dependent.
432b. They are agglutinative.
c. They are stressless.
d. They are subject to automatic phonological rules only.
V. Lexicon
a. Host plus clitic forms are not lexicalized.
b. Clitics alternate with free words.”
Clitics are defined over the property that some word-like elements have of being
prosodically deficient. Among the various attempts to establish a typology of clitics, the
one most often referred to in the literature is by Zwicky (1977). Zwicky classifies clitics
into three types: simple clitics, special clitics, and bound words. A simple clitic “is an
element of some basic word class, which appears in a position relative to the rest of the
structure in which the normal rules of the syntax would (or at least could) put it”
(Anderson 1992:200). A special clitic “is one whose position within some phrasal unit is
determined by principles other than those of the non-clitic syntax” (Anderson 1992:201202). Bound words “are the words which don’t correspond to a full form and thus can’t
possibly be analyzed as reductions of ‘real’ words, but which nevertheless need a host
and in some cases are restricted to a particular sentence position” (Spencer 1991:376).
Perhaps the best candidate for a simple clitic among the special bound formatives
are the subject/possessor pronominal markers as well as the object pronominal markers.
The special property of the subject/possessor pronominal markers (including here the
plural marker, described in 7.1.13, that is in dependency relation with the third person
plural subject/possessor marker), as shown in 7.1.1, is that they are in complementary
distribution with coreferential pre-verbal nominal expression bearing the subject in a
clause or the possessor in a possession construction. So, these pronominal forms are able
to replace nominal expressions in some specific distributional and functional contexts,
namely as pre-verbal subject free expression or as possessor free expression. However,
433one first difference from simple clitics is that the pronominal markers, when used as
subject or as object markers, are in complementary distribution ONLY with pre-verbal
free coreferential nominal expressions, but NOT with postverbal free coreferential
nominal expressions (as shown in 7.1.1 and in 7.1.12). Another difference is that,
although the phonological similarity between subject/possessor pronominal markers and
independent pronouns is quite clear, they have partially different functions, since while
the former can only be used with subject or possessor function, the latter can be used with
subject, object or possessor function, as represented in Table 6:

unawaWhile independent pronouns can bear subject as well as object grammatical
relations, or yet bear the possessor relation (as described in detail in chapter 6, in section
6.1), the subject/possessor pronominal markers can be used to bear the subject or the
possessor, but NOT the object (as described earlier in 7.1.1). Since independent
pronouns and bound pronominal markers show some partial distinction in their
grammatical meaning, the latter cannot be described as phonological reductions of the
former —although there is likely to be a diachronic link between the two sets of
pronominal forms. Therefore, subject/possessor pronominal markers cannot be described
as simple clitics, that is, as simple phonological reductions of the independent pronouns.","[462, 463, 464, 465]"
"268Chapter 5Verb Morphology
5.0. Introduction
The focus of this chapter will be on the internal structure of verbs and their
syntactic properties; that is, how verbs are formed and the subcategories that may arise
from their morphological and syntactic properties. As nouns, verbs take bound
formatives that only attach to verb forms (i.e. bound formatives that are inherently
verbal), as well as, also, formatives that occur outside of the inherently verbal
morphology. The majority of this outer-layer morphological forms are not inherently
verbal insofar as they can attach to nouns, pronouns and/or a few other closed word
classes (depending on the bound formative in question). In this chapter I will focus
exclusively on the morphological forms that are inherently verbal, that is, the bound
formatives that only occur as part of verb bases. The bound formatives that occur outside
of the inherently verbal morphology will be described as a special class of bound
formatives in chapter 7.
Verbs in Apurinã, as a part of speech, can be distinguished from nouns on the
basis of various syntactic and morphological properties. An example of an inherently
nominal morphological property is the plural marker -wako-ru1/-wako-ro.
-wako-ru1/-wako-ro, which was described in the previous chapter, in 4.5.1, as a number
marker, and is further illustrated in (1a) where it attaches to the noun stem kãkutu
269‘people’ to mark plural. The example in (1b), on the other hand, illustrates the fact that
-wako-ru1/-wako-ro cannot occur with verbs:
1a. hãkiti-nhi
kãkutu-wako-ru1 keta
jaguar-AFFECT person-PL-M
shoot
‘The (male) people shot the poor jaguar.’
b. *hãkiti-nhi
kãkutu keta-wako-ru1
jaguar-AFFECT person shoot-PL-M
(The (male) people shot the jaguar)
In the verb reside the most complex morphological structures found in the
language. Although the interaction of verb-internal forms with typical syntactic functions
is constant, this chapter surveys only the processes and verb forms (through which such
processes are formally encoded) that need to be considered in building a grammatical
verb category. The ways by which these processes and verb forms are relevant for the
clausal and propositional units are described in chapters 8-9.
Analogous to nouns, verbs can consist of elements that are prefixed or suffixed to
a verb base (here used as a neutral term to refer to any verbal unit to which bound forms
can be added). It will become clear when these elements are presented in the rest of this
chapter that the verb morphology (like the noun morphology) is predominantly suffixal.
Among 31 position classes (i.e. slot positions, including those described in chapter 7)
clearly identified in the base of non-descriptive verbs (i.e. those that are not propertyreferring verbs, see 5.1.1.1.1, 5.1.1.2, and 5.2), 30 are suffixal and only 1 is prefixal.
Although the morphology of descriptive verbs (i.e. property-referring verbs) is more
limited, it includes a subset of the non-descriptive verbs morphology plus two prefix
positions inherent to descriptive verb bases. The number of (mutually exclusive)
formatives that can occur in each of such position classes can vary from one to seven.
270Most position classes consist of only one formative. The set of subject/possessor
pronominal markers may have seven or five members depending on how one interprets
the homophonous forms used both in the singular and plural. Both the pronominal
marking sets (which will be described in detail in chapter 7, in 7.1.1 and 7.1.12) are given
in Table 1 below for convenience, since they will be referred to very often as important
verbal properties:

…-na, such that both u-… and …-na will always co-occur in order to encode third person
plural. Although …-na has been added to Table 1, it occupies its own position class in
the verb —as will be made clear in chapter 7, in 7.1.1.1. As it is clear from Table 1, these
pronominal markers behave as cumulative morphs (in Anderson’s [1988:154]
terminology, or as multiple exponence or cumulation in Spencer’s [1991] terminology,
or as portmanteau morphs1 in Bauer’s [1994:17] terminology). What all these terms1Linguists, perhaps from different linguistic traditions, use the term “portmanteau” to refer exclusively to morphemes
resulting from the contraction of morphs (e.g. Spencer 1991:50) or to morphemes that accumulate meanings (e.g.
Bauer 1994:17).","[299, 300, 301, 302]"

Thus, once we have added CN2s to the typology of classifying systems, it comes
as no surprise to note DeLancey’s suggestion of the existence of a continuum from pure
noun to pure classifier, and that such continuum can be observed in the syntactic and
semantic behavior of certain nouns and classifiers. Such a continuum has been attested in
the form of class terms in some South-East Asian languages. CN2s in Apurinã then
would constitute another manifestation of similar continuum, this time in an Amazonian
language.
4.1.1.2.4Remarks on the Semantic Nature of C(lassificatory)N(oun)2sIn the previous sections we have seen that Apurinã has CN2s; that CN2s are the
recurrent elements in productive noun compounding; that some CN2s can be used as
anaphor-like nominal elements that can be incorporated into the verb in a manner similar
to certain verb incorporated classifiers; and that CN2s play important grammatical roles in187the morphology, syntax and the lexicon of the language, as well as that they can
encompass important discourse and pragmatic roles.
In the analysis presented above for CN2s, I have suggested that there is enough
synchronic evidence pointing toward a continuum within which the nature of CN2s can
be understood. When we look at CN2s in productive compounding by isolating parts of
this continuum based on observable differences in their semantic or syntactic behavior,
we identify parts of the mechanisms by which lexical meaning “emerges” as a result of
language use and language variation. In terms of their semantic properties, we have seen
that CN2s have two sources currently attested: most CN2s derive from plant parts/nature
elements, and a few others derive from body parts. The fact, however, that there are too
few instances of the latter cases does not allow us to discard the possibility that further
investigation may reveal that all CN2s have plant parts/nature elements as source
meanings. Moreover, CN2s occur as one of the elements in a productive noun compound
and they refer to anatomical properties of the derived meaning of the compound. Thus,
CN2s may refer to semantic properties of nouns which fall into two or three of the
following meaning categories: (i) plant parts/nature elements (as source meaning), (ii)
body parts (as derived meaning and, perhaps, also as source meaning), (iii) manufactured
elements (as derived meaning).
Based on the descriptive information above, two important questions can be asked
about CNs:
I - What is the motivation which may lead the same CN2s with the semantic field
in (i) to be used to refer to the semantic field in (ii) and/or in (iii), or those with the
semantic field in (ii) to refer to the semantic field in (iii)? Furthermore, can we say188anything on why the source semantic field is (i) rather than (ii), when the converse seems
to be more well attested crosslinguistically?
II - In terms of the semantic internal structure of CN2s, which are the semantic
properties that are preserved or abandoned as CN2s have their meaning extended with
accompanying semantic bleaching?
The semantic development of CNs suggests a number of semantic changes that
can be explained through metaphorical extensions of particular source meanings into
particular target meanings. One type of semantic change observed was that which occurs
when plant parts have their meaning extended to refer to body parts. In contrast, another
semantic change occurs with the extension of meaning from plant parts to manufactured
elements. For instance, there is a sense in which the use of -muna in ãã-muna ‘tree’ is
different from its use in kiri-muna ‘animal’s nose’; and the use of -muna in aiko-muna
‘house bean’ is different from both of the previous uses. In the first case, -muna refers to
the properties of a plant; in the second case, -muna refers to the properties of a body part;
and in the third case, -muna refers to the properties of a manufactured element. Is it the
case that, in the three cases, -muna carries the same meaning properties? If yes, then
what are these meaning properties? Are the various uses of -muna a case of polysemy or
homonyny?
As Sweetser points out “[n]o historical change of meaning can take place without
an intervening stage of polysemy. If a word once meant A and now means B, we can be
fairly certain that speakers did not just wake up and switch meanings on June 14, 1066.
Rather, there was a stage when the word meant both A and B, and the earlier meaning of
A eventually was lost” (1991:9). In that view, -muna could be, conceivably, treated as an
instance of polysemy. Now, does this help us answer question I or II posited above?
189How can we show that each instance of -muna in words like ãã-muna ‘tree,’ aiko-muna
‘house beam,’ kiri-muna ‘animal nose’ etc... corresponds to different word meanings that
happen to be expressed in the language by the same phonological form? If we followed a
strict version of the polysemy view, we would end up having to accept a lexicon
consisting of lexical entries such as -muna1, -muna2, -muna3, -muna4, -muna5 etc... which
when applied to the other CN2s of the language would generate a close to infinite number
of lexical meanings the language learner would need to memorize. This certainly is not a
desirable result. If on the other, we assume that there is enough similarities among the
various uses of -muna that justifies to treat them as semantically related in some way, we
find ourselves in the position of having to show which “similarities” those are.
Question I could be answered if we made use of the some sort of cultural mode
underlying the use of CN2s. We may take CN1s (i.e. plant parts/nature elements and
perhaps body parts) to constitute the set of semantic properties expressing a source
domain, whereas CN2 (manufactured elements) would constitute a target domain. In
order to understand, express or conceptualize elements within the target domain,
elements of the source domain are used. The meaning of CN2s would emerge out of the
mappings between image-schematic models containing “specific schematic images,
such as trajectories or long, thin shapes or containers” (Lakoff 1986:31). There would be
three of such image-schematic models involved here, one for (i) plant parts/nature
elements, another for (ii) body parts and, finally, a third for (iii) manufactured elements.
These mappings could be characterized as metaphoric mappings within a metaphoric
model (idem), in which elements from one image-schematic model maps onto another
one, as (i) maps onto (ii), (i) maps onto (iii), and (ii) maps onto (iii), as in the diagrams
below:

ELEMENTSFig. 6: From Body Parts to Manufacture Elements
Apurinã then would have conceptual mappings of a sort that motivate the
meaning alternation of CN2s. As a first approximation, Apurinã could be said to have the
following global conceptual metaphoric mapping:
THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ANIMAL BODIES/MANUFACTURED
ELEMENTS ARE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PLANT PARTS OR
NATURE ELEMENTS.
Fig. 7: Generic Metaphoric Model
A version of such a conceptual metaphorical mapping in Apurinã could be
grounded on the Apurinã cosmology wherein plants and non-human animals are treated
as the same sort of beings —as attested in the Apurinã creation mythology. Thus, what
we would be finding is that there would be a generic metaphoric model embedded into an
Apurinã idealized cultural model (or an Idealized Cognitive Model, see Lakoff 1987)
which would work to motivate the use of certain semantic domains in connection with
other semantic domains, in this case, the semantic domain of plant parts/nature elements
191in connection with that of body parts (Fig. 4), or of plant parts/nature elements in
connection with that of manufactured elements (Fig. 5), or the semantic domain of body
parts in connection with that of manufactured elements (cf. Fig. 6). Within this semantic
analysis, CN1 and CN2 can be treated as items that constitute a natural category (see
Lakoff 1982); their commonality consists of the similarities perceptually identifiable in
their semantic contribution to the derived compound noun, such similarities consisting of
shape and/or consistency. Physical shape and consistency are the general set of semantic
features making an anatomical image-schematic model that, once made available to the
speakers, can be extensively used with CN2s with functions beyond that of a simple head
of a noun compound. That is when CN2s can be used as modifying elements with
attributive function in nouns or in verb incorporation.
In order to answer question II, we need a more detailed analysis of the semantic
features (properties) of CN2s; we need to specify the shape and consistency properties
involved in the mappings posited in Figures (4-6). In order to motivate the properties of
CN2s in terms of image-schematic mappings, we need to specifically describe which
particular properties are being mapped between domains. That is, it still remains to be
said which of the several different “physical properties of Plant Parts/Nature Elements”
are associated to the “physical properties of Body Parts/Manufactured Elements,” and so
on. This is what is dealt with in the next paragraphs.
A semantic analysis of the data allows us to make sense out of the descriptive
facts by positing schematic models which would motivate the association of the semantic
fields given in (i)-(iii) above. Such an analysis also allows us to note that it is the
perceptually salient physical properties inherent to (i) and/or (ii) that are mapped onto (ii)
and/or (iii). However, we have only been able to account for the semantic classes whose
192properties are associated to one another (through metaphorical mappings), and to
motivate only one very general set of properties involved in the semantic mappings,
namely the set of “physical salient properties.” The obvious question then would be
“How do we know which properties are salient?” One way to find the answer to this
question would be to perform psycholinguistic experimental tests such as those used in
Prototype studies à la Rosch 1977. Another possibility would be to use linguistic
information through a structural analysis of the data. It is the structural analysis that
follows below.
The CN2 -muna can be used to illustrate how the data presented in the paper
indicate that it is that the most salient features inherent to the source domain (i.e. CN1)
turn out to be preserved in the target domain (i.e. CN2). As we have already seen
above, -muna can only be used with plant parts names (when used with the plant
parts/nature elements category) to refer to trees with large trunks. It is generally the case
that such large trunks have as salient perceptible properties the fact that they are ‘thick,’
‘rigid,’ and ‘cylindrical’. Hence ‘thick,’ ‘rigid’, and ‘cylindrical’ can be naturally
interpreted as the salient source meaning properties of the CN2 -muna. Now, having
established the source salient properties of -muna, we can examine which of such
properties remain or are lost when -muna is used to refer to body parts or manufactured
elements. As seen in the Table 13 below, the ‘rigid’ property is lost when used to refer to
body parts, but maintained when used to refer to manufactured elements. Thus, the
recurring properties of -muna across categories are ‘thick’ and ‘cylindrical’.
In Table 13, I extend the analysis for each CN2 in order to illustrate the recurring
properties which can be observed when CN2s refer to the shape or consistency of plant
parts/Nature Elements, body parts, and manufactured elements. Hence, in Table 13 we
193track the original salient properties for each CN2 as such properties are preserved or lost
when the CN2s are used with any of the relevant noun categories. As a result, we arrive
at the (presumed) “core” properties, that is, meanings that may recur across categories, as
summarized in Table 14.
Thus, in Table 14 the “core” properties can conceivably be taken to be the
specific features which are mapped from the source to the target domains which were
represented in Figs. 4-6.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225]"
"Subject/Possessor Pronominal Markers
The subject/possessor pronominal markers, briefly mentioned in theintroduction to chapter 5, in section 5.0, consist of the set of bound pronominal
formatives that can attach to nouns to express the possessor in a possession construction
or to verbs to function as the subject marker. These pronominal markers, listed in Table
3791, inflect for number, person and for the gender of third person singular: (See chapter 3,
in subsection 3.6.2, for the allomorphic variations of these pronominal markers.)

special bound formatives: first, because they are in complementary distribution with
coreferential preverbal subject NPs as well as with coreferential independent
(pro)nominal possessors, and, second, because they can be described as attaching to both
noun as well as verb bases. The list in (3-4) illustrates the pronominal markers both with
verb forms and with noun forms:

g. u-kuwu(-na)
3-head.of-3PLThese examples illustrate the fact that the same pronominal forms attach to noun forms as
well as to verb forms. Moreover, these pronominal markers are interpreted as subject
markers when attached to verb bases, as shown in (3), and as possessor markers when
attached to noun bases, as shown in (4). In (3) the standard intransitive verb muteka ‘to
run’ (which could be replaced with any other standard intransitive verb or with any
transitive verb, as many of the examples seen so far illustrate) inflect for person, number
and (in the case of third person singular) gender. In (4) the alienable noun form kuwu
‘head of’ takes the corresponding pronominal forms that attach to noun bases to function
as possessors. As was mentioned in the introduction to chapter 5, the formative -na in
(4g) is a plural marker that is in a discontinuous dependency relation with the third
person marker u-. That is, in order to express third person plural subject/possessor by
means of the subject/possessor pronominal markers, the third person marker u- is
prefixed to a verb/noun form and the third person plural marker -na is suffixed to the
verb/noun form. Insofar as both u- and -na need to co-occur in order for the semantic
‘third person plural’ to be expressed through bound forms, u- and -na are in a
discontinuous dependency relation. Since all special bound formatives are presented
following the internal distribution in their host, and since u- and -na have distinct
distributions within their host base, -na will only be properly presented later in subsection
7.1.13. Furthermore, -na is in parenthesis in (4g) to represent the fact that nowadays not
all speakers make use of the plural marker -na in expressing third person plural. Some
381speakers use, instead, only the form u- to express both third person singular masculine
and third person plural masculine or feminine.1
Note that these pronominal forms, when attached to noun forms as possessor
markers, are not simply possession markers that are co-indexed with the ""real"" free
expression of a nominal possessor; in fact, they are in complementary distribution with
free nominal possessors, as shown by the examples in (5): (Underlining marks
coreference.)
5a. *nota nu-nuro

b. *pita pu-nuro

3SG 3M-mother.of
(man's mother)
d. *suto
o-nuro
woman 3M-mother.of
(woman's mother)
etc...
When used with verbs as subject markers, pronominal markers differ in one
particular way from the more familiar agreement markers found in various other
languages (e.g., Romance languages in general). In Apurinã, the subject/possessor
pronominal markers are in complementary distribution with the coreferential pre-verbal1In my last visit to the field, I also found that in some speech varieties the plural marker –na works as a plurality
marker for both third person non-object and third person object. For example, in the Fortaleza village (Marahã area),
‘They looked at me’ is uttered as Ø-etama-ta-no-ne (3-look-VBLZ-1O-PL) and ‘I looked at them’ is uttered as382free subject (pro)nominal forms. That is, whereas pronominal markers used as possessors
are in complete complementary distribution with any coreferential free (pro)nominal
forms expressing the possessor, these same pronominal markers, when used as subject
markers in verbs, are in complementary distribution with pre-verbal, but NOT with postverbal, coreferential free (pro)nominal expressions of the subject. The complementary
distribution is shown by the three examples in (6):
u-su-pe
6a. *uwa
3SG.M 3M-go-PFTV
(He has left.)
b. *suto
o-apo-pe
3SG.F 3F-arrive-PFTV
(The woman has arrived.)
c. *suto
o-apa-nanu-ta-ru
aõtu
woman 3F-fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O umari
(The woman was gathering “umari” fruit.)
d. *nota nhi-nhika-ru
nhi-nhipoko-re
1SG 1SG-eat-3M.O 1SG-food-POSSED
(I ate my food.)
In (6a) the clause is ungrammatical because the pre-verbal independent pronoun
uwa ‘3SG.M’ co-occurs with the coreferential subject/possessor pronominal marker u-; in
(6b) the clause is ungrammatical because the pre-verbal nominal form suto ‘woman’ cooccurs with the coreferential subject/possessor pronominal marker o- ‘3M.O’; finally, in
(6c-d) both clauses are ungrammatical because the pre-verbal noun form suto and the preverbal independent pronoun nota ‘1SG’ co-occur, respectively, with the coreferential
pronominal markers o- in (6c) and nhi- (6d).n-etama-ta—ne (1SG-see-VLBZ-PL). At this point I do not know how the potential ambiguityis resolved in cases383In contrast to pre-verbal free subject (pro)nominal forms and their coreferential
pronominal markers, there is no complementary distribution between free post-verbal
(pro)nominal forms and their corresponding coreferential subject/possessor pronominal
markers in the verb, as the examples in (7) demonstrate:
7a. u-su-pe
uwa
3M-go-PFTV 3SG.M
‘He has left.’
b. o-apo-pe
suto
3F-arrive-PFTV woman
‘The woman has arrived.’
c. aõtu o-apa-nanu-ta-ru
suto
umari 3F-fetch-PROG-VBLZ-3M.O woman
‘The woman was gathering “umari” fruit.
d. nhi-nhipoko-re
nhi-nhika-ru
nota
1SG-food-POSSED 1SG-eat-3M.O 1SG
‘I ate my food.’
Therefore, the descriptive facts reveal that (i) subject/possessor markers attached
to verb forms are mutually exclusive with coreferential free pre-verbal (pro)nominal
forms (but not with postverbal ones), that (ii) subject/possessor markers attached to noun
forms are mutually exclusive with any free coreferential (pro)nominal element, and, also,
that (iii) pronominal markers are obligatory if no pre-verbal nominal is found in a clause
—although the converse is not true (see also 9.7.2).
The reason why the meaning ‘possessor’ is not included as part of the gloss of
these pronominal markers in the examples above is that the meaning ‘possessor’ can be
described as a function of the slot these markers occupy in the noun base, rather than aswhere both core arguments are non-coreferential third person plural.","[410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415]"
"6.3 Numerals
Two numerals are found in any Apurinã speech variety. The first of them, hãt-u ‘one-M’
or hãt-o (one-F), inflects for gender; the second of them is epi ‘two’. To count over two, hãt-u/o
and epi are combined with the form -pakunu ‘plus’, as illustrated in (4):
Table 4: Numerals
Forms
hãt-u, hãt-o
epi
epi-hãtu-pakunu
epi-epi-pakunu
epi-epi-hãtu-pakunuGloss
‘one (M., F)’
‘two’
‘three’
‘four’
‘five’The examples in (17) illustrate the use of numerals modifying nouns:
17a. hãt-u kuku
one-M man
‘one/other man.’
b. hãt-o suto
one-F woman
‘one/other woman.’
c. epi kuku-wako-ru
two man-PL-M
‘two men’
d. epi suto-wako-ro
two woman-PL-F
‘two women’359As the following examples show, although numerals resemble demonstratives in that they
also precede the noun, the two co-occur with a fixed order with the demonstrative preceding the
numeral and, thus, have a different syntactic distribution. This is true to the extent that, in
Apurinã, the distribution of words within larger units constitutes a somewhat reliable syntactic
criterion for distinguishing parts of speech (see 8.2.1). In the following examples hãt-u, hãt-o
and epi occur with the noun forms hãtako-ru/-ro ‘boy/girl’ forming a nominal construction that
is determined by the demonstrative forms i-/o-ye:
18a. i-ye
hãt-u hãtako-ru
M-DEM one-M youth-M
‘this one/other boy’
b. o-ye
hãt-o hãtako-ro
M-DEM one-F youth-F
‘this one/other girl’
19a. i-ye
epi hãtako-ru
M-DEM two youth-M
‘these two boys’
b. o-ye
epi hãtako-ro
F-DEM two youth-F
‘these two girls’
The traditional Apurinã way to count works on a base of two. In order to count over two
it is necessary to combine hãt-u/hãt-o and epi ‘two’ with the bound form -pakunu ‘plus’ (briefly
described in 7.4.2), as the following examples show:
20a. epi hãt-u-pakunu hãtako-ru
two one-M-plus
youth-M
‘three boys’360b. epi epi-pakunu hãtako-ru
two two-plus
youth-M
‘four boys’
c. epi epi hãt-u-pakunu hãtako-ru
two two one-M-plus
youth-M
‘five boys’
In elicited data speakers often count up to three or four using this system. Five is
normally translated as ‘one handful’, and speakers tend to get confused when counting over five.
Reports by Pickering (1971:33) show that in the past speakers could count up to ten using the
traditional system. Some speakers have also given unrelated complex words when counting over
five. Nowadays it is more common to find Apurinã speakers using the Portuguese numerals.","[390, 391, 392]"
"6059.1.2.3The Syntactic Category of the “Verb-inhi”: Verbal or Nominal
The purpose of this section is to describe the syntactic category of the verbmarked by -inhi in the complement clause. Similar to the relativizers described above in
9.1.1.5, the gerund marker -inhi was morphologically described as a part of the noun stem
morphology in 4.4.7. However, as became clear from the previous discussion on
complementation, -inhi functions syntactically to mark clausal complements. The
following paragraphs analyze the sort of properties that can be used in deciding whether
the gerund marker indeed nominalizes the verbs it attaches too, or whether it simply
attaches to verbs to form other verbal forms. Some initial discussion of this issue was
briefly introduced in 4.4.7 in a morphological context, and is now reviewed in a syntactic
context.
Of all the data on complement clauses marked with -inhi presented in 9.1.2.2
there is one first major piece of evidence that can be gathered from the examples in (49)
in favor of analyzing V-inhi as a verbal (rather than nominal) construction. In (49) the
complement clause is [ããta u-kam-inhi-ro] (canoe.POSSED 3M-make-GER-3F.O). In
this complement clause -inhi precedes an object pronominal marker, -ru in (49). As far
as the morphological structure of words in Apurinã goes, these pronominal markers could
not be added to a form unless such a form were a verb (as shown by the detailed
morphological analysis of the verb category in chapter 5). Notice that the pronominal
markers in these complement clauses are definitely object pronominal markers, and not,
for example, their homonym gender markers described under 4.4.1. As is clear in these
complement clauses, the object pronominal markers can express or be coreferential with
an independent NP also referring to the object of the verb (as was shown in further details606under 8.3.1.2), whereas the gender markers simply assign the masculine/feminine gender
to the noun form they attach to (as shown in 4.4.1). Hence on the basis of examples such
the ones in (49), V-inhi has a verbal (rather than nominal) morphological property.
A second piece of evidence for the verbal status of V-inhi is found in all
grammatical examples in 9.1.2.2, except for the ones in (51) and (52) —which have an
intransitive verb in the complement clause. Except for the two latter examples, all the
ones described in 9.1.1.2.2 include forms corresponding to the subject and the object in
the complement clause. That is, while an argument could be made that complement
clauses with intransitive predicates such as the ones in (51) and (52) have been
nominalized and that the notional subject is expressed as possessor whereas the verb is
expressed as possessed forms, the same argument cannot be made for complement
clauses with transitive predicates.7 Hence, notwithstanding the fact that further
information on their syntactic behavior is required, the presence of syntactic forms
corresponding to the subject and object in complement clauses marked with -inhi would
suggest V-inhi to be a verbal construction.
However, in contrast to the verbal properties presented for V-inhi above, there are
two other properties suggesting that V-inhi is also a nominal construction, where
“nominal” is to be understood as “associated with typical complex noun and/or NP
properties” (as described in 4.6 and in 8.1.1, respectively). The first nominal property
can be motivated on the basis of the examples described in (52) for the third type of7Notice that in English clauses such as ‘my killing of the jaguar’, the two types of possession markings available in the
language are used in nominalizing a transitive clause. There is no reason to believe that a corresponding strategy is
available in Apurinã, even because in this language there is only one general strategy for marking possession,
namely the one involving juxtaposition of nominal forms combined with the possibility of marking the possessed
form with a suffix, depending on its lexical properties, as shown under 4.1.","[636, 637, 638]"
"6.7.5 Hortative Particle
The hortative particle can be realized as (h)amo or am-, depending on a combination of
speech variety in the first case, or on rate of speech, in the second case. As the label suggests,
hortative is used to incite or invite someone to do something, as shown by the examples in (37).
I will say more on hortative marking in chapter 8, in 8.8.3.1, when presenting the clause it occurs
within as speech act.

3746.8 Final Remarks
As is clear from the list of words belonging to the closed classes presented in this chapter,
only a limited set of grammatical functions can be expressed in Apurinã by means of such
independent words. This follows as a natural consequence of the wide range of grammatical
functions expressed by bound formatives in the language, as the ones described in chapters 3-5
and the ones that will be described in the next chapter. Moreover, although closed word classes
such as independent pronouns, in general, possess no inherent morphological properties formally
marked (i.e., with very few exceptions such as the 3rd person plural marker -na, they are not
generally segmentable into class-specific morphemes in the same way as nouns and verbs are).
Finally, I will return to some of the closed classes or words in chapters 8-9, where the syntax of
simplex sentences is described. As happens in various other places in this work, certain word
properties can be better described within the specific domains of the grammar that these
properties are most relevant to. This applies most clearly to the interrogative words and to the
majority of the particles introduced above. In fact, even more than syntactic structures, discourse
particles require information about the organization of the Apurinã discourse structure in order to
be properly described. Since this work does not include a description of discourse structures,
discourse particles cannot (unfortunately) be satisfactorily described here.","[405, 406]"
"5779.1.1.1.7“Inverse” Relative ClausesAside from the relative pronominal markers described above and the types of
ClRELs they mark, there is one last subset left. This subset was given in the last column in
Table 1 above, and it consists of -keru and -kero. The form ??-keno, also given in Table
1, is a putative form that can be arrived at by internal reconstruction, that has not been
attested in the language and, as such, that may never have existed at all. In the present
analysis only the attested singular forms (i.e. -keru and -kero) are described. The basic
facts about these markers may sound complex at first and can be best described in two
parts: First, in purely distributional terms, -keru and -kero occur attached to transitive
verbs in ClRELs containing an overt (phonologically) free argument expression that refers
to first or second person singular, or an argument encoded as a pronominal marker; and,
second, in functional terms, -keru and -kero invert the semantic roles of subject and
object when the former is encoded as first or second person singular or as a bound
pronominal marker. These descriptive facts are observable in the following examples.
First, take the simplex sentences in (24), where the subjects of both sentences are
coreferential:
O
s-V
24a. kuku n-/pu-/a-/h-atama-ta
man 1SG/3M/2SG/1PL/2PL-see-VBLZ
‘I/you(SG)/we/you(PL) saw the man.’
s-V
b. kuku apo-pe
man arrive-PFTV
‘The man has arrived.’578If the two sentences above are combined to form a complex sentence where (24a) is
embedded in (24b) as a ClREL marked with -keru, the result is the complex sentence in
(25):
S/ACTOR [undergoer-V-rel.inv

25. kuku
n-/pu-/a-/h-atama-ta-keru
apo-pe
man
1SG/2SG/1PL/2PL-see-REL.M.INV arrive-PFTV
‘The man who saw me/him/you/us/you(PL) has arrived.’
In (25) kuku is the headREL, n-/pu-/a-/h-atamatakeru ‘who saw
me/you/us/you(PL)’ is the ClREL, and apo-pe ‘has arrived’ is the verb of the matrix
clause. Note that there is NOT an error in the gloss, the bound subject pronominal forms
n-/pu-/a-/h- that encoded the actor semantic role in the simplex sentence in (24a) indeed
now encode the undergoer semantic role in the ClREL in (25); and the form kuku that
encoded an undergoer semantic role in (24b) now encodes the actor semantic role of the
ClREL in (25). Hence, my use of “S/ACTOR” (i.e. subject of the matrix clause/actor in
the ClREL) on top of kuku and of “s-“ (i.e. bound subject marker) on top of n-/pu-/a-/h- in
(25) reflects the syntactic roles that would be associated with these forms if there was not
an “inverse” ClREL pronominal marker. This inversion of the semantic roles of subject
and object (from actor to undergoer and vice-versa) is the most interesting aspect of these
relative pronominal markers, and is what has led me to refer to the type of ClRELs marked
with -keru/-kero as “inverse” ClRELs —the quotation marks being justified in the
following paragraphs.
Take now the simplex sentences in (26-27), which can be combined into complex
sentences such as those in (28):579O

The purpose of the examples in (28) is twofold. First, the example in (28a) shows
that the “inverse” relative pronominal markers can also be used when the argument of the
ClREL is expressed as independent pronouns for first or second person singular. So, in
(28a) kuku is the headREL, nota/pita karota-kero ‘who saw me/you’ is the ClREL, and
apo-pe the verb of the matrix clause. And, second, the examples in (28) also demonstrate
the gender distinction, also marked in “inverse” relative pronominal markers. In (28b)
suto is the feminine headREL, p-atama-ta-kero ‘who saw you’ is the ClREL taking the
580relative marker (-kero) inflected for the feminine gender to agree with the headREL suto,
and kona apoka ‘not arrive’ is the predicate of the matrix clause:
The examples in (29) are analogous to the ones above, except that the headREL
both in (29a) and in (29b) is object in the matrix clause, whereas in the previous
examples given in this section the headREL is subject in the matrix clause. The data in
(29) are given (for the sake of completeness) to demonstrate that, as is the case with the
other pronominal relative markers described in previous sections, the role of the headREL
in the matrix clause is irrelevant for the marking of “inverse” ClRELs.

The final examples of this subsection are given in (30), and they demonstrate one
of the properties mentioned above for “inverse” ClRELs: These clauses are restricted to
the ones where the overt argument is expressed by a pronominal marker or by first or
second person independent pronouns. Hence, the example in (30a) is ungrammatical
because the undergoer argument of the ClREL is a third person singular independent
nominal expression; and the one in (30b) is ungrammatical because the undergoer of the
ClREL is neither first nor second person singular:

(The man who hurt her/him/us/you has arrived.)
There are two ways in that “inverse” ClRELs may be seen (under one specific
view) as reminiscent to inverse systems such as the one of North American Algonquian
languages (Foley and Van Valin 1985:296-399 and references there cited). The first is
that affixes otherwise associated with actors are associated instead with undergoers. The
second is that part of the constraints on the use of the “inverse” relative pronominal
marker is that the inverse is required when the actor is third person and the undergoer is
first or second person, partially following a person hierarchy. While the first way in
which a comparison can be made between “inverse” ClRELs and inverse systems is clear,
the second way put forth here is not so straightforward, thus requiring some further
justification below.
The “inverse” ClRELs constitute a type of restrictive clause. The semantics and
pragmatics of first and second person pronouns are such that, in most usual
circumstances, they are incompatible with those inherent to a headREL modified by a
restrictive ClREL. Since the most common function of a restrictive relative clause is to
specify, identify, restrict, etc., the meaning of the headREL, it cannot in principle modify
first or second person. It follows then that the headREL modified by a restrictive ClREL
refers, by definition, to third person, not first or second. Therefore, it follows that the
constraint on the kinds of independent pronouns that can function as undergoer of
“inverse” ClRELs plus the semantics and pragmatics inherent to restrictive ClRELs and
(exclusively) to first and second persons singular will produce only “inverse” ClRELs with
582independent subjects where 3>1,2 (i.e. third person acts on first and second persons
singular). However, at the same time that this analysis of the data can be used to justify
an analogy between “inverse” ClRELs and inverse systems in other languages, it can also
be used to understand the properties of “inverse” ClRELs as a development which is
independent and (perhaps) unrelated to true inverse systems.
An explanation, however, is still needed for why pronominal forms are among the
elements that can be the overt argument of “inverse” ClREL, and for why constraints that
apply to independent pronouns referring to first and second persons singular do not apply
to those referring to first and second persons plural. Of all the types of restrictive ClRELs
found in Apurinã, “inverse” ClRELs are the ones that require further investigation the
most. The data presented here are mostly based on the speech of one speaker and,
although, the speaker was very consistent in producing data with the same cluster of
properties given above, further verification needs to be done with more speakers, even if
only to confirm that the speech of more speakers shares such properties. It is possible,
for example, that what is described here as “inverse” ClRELs is actually the residue of
another subsystem of relativization that is pretty much out of use in the language
nowadays.
9.1.1.2Headless Relative Clauses
In all types of relative clauses described above there is a headREL that is modifiedby the ClREL. The purpose of this subsection is to show that ClRELs can also be headless,
that is, they can occur with no headREL. The pair of examples in (31) illustrates headless
ClRELs marked, respectively, with the subject and the object relative pronominal markers.
In (31a) the headless ClREL is suto oka-karu ‘who/what killed the woman’, and the
583subject is encoded solely by the subject relative pronominal marker -karu. In (31b) the
headless ClREL is a-nhika-kutu ‘what we eat’, and the object is encoded solely by the
object relative pronominal marker -kutu:
s-V-o

V-rel.s ]ClREL

b. a-nhika-kutu
hareka-putu-ru
1PL-eat-REL.M.O be.good-EMPH-3M.O
‘What we eat is very good.’
The example in (32) is illustrative of a headless ClREL where the negative form of
the subject relative pronominal marker is used. The headless ClREL is ma-ãreka-kat-inhi
‘the one who is not bad’, and the subject is encoded solely by the negative relative
subject pronominal marker -katu:

32. ma-ãreka-kati-nhi

PRIV-be.good-REL.M.S-AFFECT die

In (33) the headless ClREL is n-atama-kero ‘the one who saw me’, and it is marked with
the inverse relative pronominal marker -keru:

33. p-apoka-ru

2SG-find-3M.O 1SG-see-REL.M.S

In (34) the headless ClREL is nhipoko-ta-koru ‘the devoured one’, marked with the passive
relative pronominal marker -koru:
584[ V-rel.pass ]ClREL
34. nhipoko-ta-koru ...
eat-VBLZ-REL.F.PASS
‘What was devoured...’
Lit.: ‘The devoured one...’9.1.1.3Relative Clauses with Non-Verbal Predicators
In 8.4 two general types of clauses were identified in the language, verbal andnon-verbal. For all ClRELs described above the clauses are verbal rather than non-verbal.
This subsection describes ClRELs with non-verbal predicators. Simplex sentences
constituted of non-verbal predicators may consist of the juxtaposition of word forms, and
they can only encode states (as seen in 8.4.2). A non-verbal clause can occur inside a
complex sentence where one NP (from the non-verbal clause) is interpreted as the
headREL that is modified by another NP (also from the non-verbal clause) functioning as a
ClREL. So, in (35a), the nominal form popũka-ro ‘Apurinã-F’ works as a nominal
predicator modifying suto ‘woman’, and in (35b) suto-nhi ‘woman-AFFECT’ works as
the nominal predicator that modifies amarunu ‘child’: 3

boundaries are nowadays opaque in some speech varieties, and the word is used to mean as a hybrid now to mean
‘child’, interpretable as masculine or feminine.","[608, 609, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616]"
"607complements marked with -inhi in the previous subsection. In both of the examples in
(52a) and (52b) the complex sentence has a complement clause with an intransitive verb,
and a matrix clause with a complement-taking verb that is marked with the object
pronominal marker -ru. The presence of -ru indicates that its complement is functioning
as object of the matrix verb, in which case V-inhi would have a nominal (not verbal)
distribution. That is, in order for the V-inhi to function as the object argument of the
matrix verb it must be nominalized. This nominal distribution as evidence for the
nominal status of V-inhi is, however, a weak one, since (as seen under 9.1.2.1) even a full
sentence can also function as the object of a matrix verb, for example, for utterance verbs.
The second type of evidence, nonetheless, is stronger. This latter evidence can be
gathered from examples other than those involving a complement clause. As shown in
(53), -inhi is not restricted to complement clauses; that is, the gerund marker can also
occur with other types of subordinate clauses. In both of the examples in (53a-b) -inhi
precedes the goal oblique marker -mokaru:
S/GOAL [ S
V-GER-GOAL ]ClREL
53a. aiko
nota s-inhi-mokaru
house 1SG go-GER-GOAL
‘My going to the house...’
S/GOAL [ S
V-GER-GOAL
]ClREL
b. aiko
nota sa-nanu-t-inhi-mokaru
house 1SG go-PROGR-VBLZ-GER-GOAL
‘My being going to the house…’
As far as the organization of the Apurinã grammar is concerned, the presence of an
oblique marker is a clear evidence of the nominal property of the form it attaches to.
Hence, here we have a strong evidence for the nominal status of V-inhi. The properties
relevant to determining the syntactic status of V-inhi can then be summarized as follows:
608Table 4: Properties of Complement Clauses with V-inhi
Verbal Properties
. take object pronominal markers
. maintain forms corresponding to subj/objNominal Properties
. function as NP subj/obj
. take oblique markersThe conclusion that arises as a result of analyzing the verbal/nominal properties
listed in Table 4 is that V-inhi shares both a subset of nominal and a subset of verbal
properties, and that only a more in-depth analysis that takes into consideration other
factors such as, for example, the ones described in Comrie and Thompson 1985:358-391
for action nominals can reveal whether there are more reasons to place V-inhi into the
verbal rather than the nominal category or vice-versa. In this particular fashion, the
gerund marker then bears some similarities with the relative pronominal markers
described earlier in the chapter.","[638, 639, 640]"
"5.2. The Morphology of Non-Descriptive Verbs
In this section, standard intransitive and transitive verbs (i.e. those that are not
descriptive verbs) are grouped under the umbrella non-descriptive verbs. Descriptive
verbs will continue to be called descriptive verbs. Non-descriptive and descriptive verbs
are described separately because their morphology follows slightly different patterns and,
also, because only a small percentage of the rich morphology attested in verbs applies to
descriptive verbs.
In the following subsections it will be clear that the verb morphology (like the
noun morphology) is organized in what I have been informally calling “slots” which can
consist of one or more morphemes with a specific position class distribution. Before
getting into the descriptive presentation proper, the following paragraphs discuss some
issues relevant to a morphological analysis of the verb structure.
The identification of position classes in a language with a rich morphology is no
trivial matter. The major problem is to obtain the right examples that show that a specific
morpheme precedes or follows another when there are just too many possible
combinations to consider. Ideally, we would like to find textual examples for each
combination; however, the rare types of combinations that make sense but which the
speakers never or rarely use may be extremely difficult to find in texts. One alternative is304to try to elicit such combinations. One of the problems with elicitation is the lack of
contexts necessary to make any sense out of combinations performing subtle functions, in
which case it is not always obvious when some unacceptable combinations result from
ungrammaticality or pure pragmatics. In the case of Apurinã, the problem is worsened by
the fact that the language still has no written literature and the speakers have not gone
through the years of school training where they might develop ways to play with the
language structure in its written form in a manner useful to find clues supporting one or
another analysis.
Standard criteria frequently used to distinguish between distinct position classes
include (i) rigid surface ordering of bound forms and (ii) complementary distribution
among the elements with identical ordering (see for example Inkelas 1993). As the data
presented in the following sections will show, criteria (i) and (ii) can be used to argue for
the need to make use of an abstract construal such as position class in order to properly
analyze the Apurinã verb morphology.","[335, 336]"
"7.1. The Meaning/Function of Special Bound
Formatives
The following subsections describe briefly the meaning and functional properties
of the various types of special bound formatives. More detailed description of the
meaning/function of these formatives will be provided in chapter 9, in the appropriate
syntactic contexts. As will be seen in the various subsections below, the grammatical
functions associated with special bound formatives do not yield other word
(sub)categories; instead, they more often add grammatical meanings that are overtly378reflected in the noun phrase or in the clause, thus being inflection-like formatives. The
order of presentation of each formative follows their internal distribution in the word base
they attach to. This distribution will be summarized in terms of position classes in 7.2.
I should also note that in various subsections below one may feel the need to ask
why certain forms are described as morphological units (rather than syntactic ones) when
they are clearly associated with predicates, phrases, clauses or even discourse functions.
The answer to this question follows from the definition of word and the domain of
morphology as described for Apurinã in chapter 3. In its relevant definition, a word can
be as complex as a phrase or clause; in fact, a word can stand syntactically as a phrase or
as a clause. However, since the primary goal of morphology is to describe the structure
of words, words need to be morphologically described even when they can stand by
themselves as a phrase or clause. This in no way means that all formatives which are
morphologically described cannot be syntactically described as well, or even described as
to their discourse functions. To the contrary, such formatives are only morphologically
described insofar as their place in the word needs to be established. Their precise
function, however, in some cases can only be properly described within the syntactic or
discourse domain. With this in mind, we can now proceed to analyze the
meaning/functional properties of special bound formatives.","[409, 410]"
"8.5.2 Valence-Decreasing Operations
In the following subsection the formal markers used in operations that result in
decreased valence are described.
8.5.2.1Intransitivization
Bivalent verbs may become monovalent as result of the suffixation of the class1bound form -rewa (morphologically described in 7.12) to the verb. As shown in (83), a
bivalent verb such as akatsata ‘to bite’ in (83a) can be made into a monovalent verb, as
seen in (83b):
S
V-o
O
83a. ãkiti akatsa-ta-ru
kuku
jaguar bite-VBLZ-3M.O man
‘The jaguar bit the man.’
S
V-intr
b. ãkiti akatsa-rewa-ta
jaguar bite-INTR-VLBZ
‘The jaguar did some biting.’
The same holds for verbs that translate as ditransitive verbs in languages like English, as
illustrated for the verb suka ‘give’ in (84a) (repeated from chapter 5), compared with
suka-rewa-ta in (84b), where the presence of -rewa again intransitivizes the verb:
S
V-o
GOAL
O
84a. nota suka-ro
uwa-mokaru nu-serepi
1SG give-3F.O 3SG.M-GOAL 1SG-arrow.of
‘I gave the arrow to him.’509s-V-intr
b. nu-suka-rewa-ta
1SG-give-INTR-VLBZ
‘I did some giving.’
Finally, the last example in (85) is given just to show that intransivized verbs cannot take
an object with or without the object pronominal marker:
S
V-o
O
85. *ãkiti akatsa-rewa-ta(-ru)
kuku)
jaguar bite-INTR-VBLZ-3M.O man)
(The jaguar did biting to the man.)8.5.2.2Reflexivization
A reflexive clause, in general terms, is one where subject and object refer to thesame participant. In Apurinã, reflexivization occurs when the class3 bound form -wa
(morphologically described in 5.2.2.1.1.11) occurs in the verb, replacing the object of a
transitive verb, occupying the same position class as object pronominal markers. In (86a)
nhi- ‘1SG’ is the subject of the bivalent verb yõka-ta ‘to.paint-VBLZ’ to which the
reflexive marker attaches to form a monovalent verb. In (86b) the only difference is that
the subject is an independent pronominal form. In (86c) an analogous process is
illustrated for the verb suka ‘to give’, making this verb monovalent:
s-V-refl
86a. nhi-yõka-ta-wa
1SG-paint-VBLZ-REFL
‘I painted myself.’
S
V-refl
b. uwa
harita-ta-wa
3SG.M beat-VBLZ-REFL
‘He beat himself.’
510Oblique
s-V-refl
c. toi-txi
o-suka-wa
thing-UNPOSS 3F-give-REFL
‘She gave herself a gift.’
As was shown in (77) above (and repeated below as 87), the reflexivizer is also
found in copula clauses marked with the verb form txa:
87a. owa-kanera
suto
o-txa-wa
3SG.F-ALSO woman 3SG.F-be-REFL
‘She is also a woman.’
b. uwa-kanera
kuku i-txa-wa
3SG.M-ALSO man 3SG.M-be-REFL
‘He is also a man.’
At this stage I cannot provide any convincing motivation for having the reflexive marker
in copula clauses. Further study is required on this issue.
8.5.2.3Reciprocity
Reciprocity can be generally defined as “a grammatical feature expressing themeaning of mutual relationship” (Crystal 1992:328), and is marked in Apurinã with the
bound verbal form -kaka. -kaka (morphologically described under 5.2.1.2.1.6) can occur
with transitive verbs that have inherent/potential reciprocal meaning, such as ‘see, meet,
talk, fight, etc.’ For a predicate to be formally marked as reciprocal there are three
requirements that need to be fulfilled: (i) the event being expressed by the clause must be
one where two or more participants act upon one another (that is, reciprocals cannot be
used as reflexives —where there would be only one participant acting upon
him/it/herself); (ii) although there have to be two or more participants in the event being
encoded by the clause, there must be only one grammatical person overtly expressed in
511the clause; and, moreover, (iii) the participant must be expressed as subject. It follows
from (i-iii) that only plural subjects can be found in reciprocal clauses. The example in
(88a), repeated from chapter 5, is a case where the subject is first person plural; in (88b)
the subject is second person plural; and in (88c) the subject is third person plural. The
example in (88d) has been constructed to show, first, that singular persons cannot be used
in reciprocal constructions, and, second, that the object cannot be overtly expressed when
the predicate is marked as reciprocal:
S
V-recipr
88a. ata atama-ta-kaka
1PL see-VBLZ-RECIPR
‘We saw each other.’
S
V-recipr
b. hĩte pitxoka-kaka
2PL kiss-RECIPR
‘You (PL) kissed each other.’
S
V-recipr
c. iye
suto-wakoro akirita-kaka
PTC woman-PL call-RECIPR
‘So, the women call one another.’
S
V-recipr-o
d. *nota txita-kaka-I
1SG argue-RECIPR-2O
(You and I argued with each other.)
The fact that only the NP that can be coreferential with pronominal subject
markers (or the pronominal subject markers themselves) can (potentially) be overtly
realized in reciprocal constructions further confirms the grammatical distinction between
the subject and object NPs. The reciprocal marker does not occur with intransitive verbs.","[540, 541, 542, 543]"
"616Appendix ALanguage Variation and the Design of the
Apurinã Orthography
Language Variation and the Phonological System
If we consider the large geographic scattering of the Apurinã speech communities, it is not
surprising to find that there are different speech varieties that make up the Apurinã language. Such
language internal diversity is a major feature of the language that cannot be ignored in the study of the
language grammatical system. In order to investigate the several speech varieties and verify in which
aspects they diverge or converge, a standardized word list was used in collecting data samples from
different communities. In the analysis of language variation presented here the phonological processes
found in the speech variety of the Japiim community is compared to the speech of 11 other communities.
Although this study served as the basis for the design of an orthographic system for the language, it still
cannot be taken as a complete survey of the Apurinã speech varieties. In order to do a more complete
survey of these Apurinã speech varieties, the speech of other communities will also need to be described in
detail, as was done for the Japiim speech community.
It is important to mention that there also are types of speech distinctions motivated by the different
degrees of mono/bilingualism and their interplay with degrees of fluency attested in different speech
communities. This part of the process of language change falls within the domain of language
obsolescence/death/coalescence and deserves more specific and systematic investigation. The data used in
the comparative analysis of the speech of 11 Apurinã communities, through which the information given in
the rest of this appendix was arrived at, are described in detail in Facundes 1997a.
All oral vowels which represent the phonemes of the Japiim speech variety are attested in the data
sample representing the speech of the other 11 communities. In two cases of allophony also considered
617here, [] is more frequent than [], and [u] is more frequent than [o]. All inherently nasal vowels are also
attested.
As to the consonants (including their allophones), some general observations are as follows:
1. The consonant /p/ is attested across speech communities in the data sample, occurring less
frequently with /u/ than with the other vowels;
2. /t/ is less frequent only with //, otherwise it occurs with all the other vowels;
3. /t/ is very frequent preceding /i/ and, to a lesser extent, /u/, which suggests a possible recent
development for its current contrastive status. The fact that /t/ does not occur with /a/, /e/, and // is not a
coincidence. I have been able to confirm in additional data that /t/ occurs with /a/ or /e/ only in very few
examples (e.g. ta ‘AUX’, piteka ‘to grow’) and it never occurs preceding //. All of this reinforces the
idea that /t/ has become contrastive only recently;
4. /ts/ occurs less frequently preceding /e/ and /i/, but common otherwise;
5. /k/ is absolutely common across all speech communities;
6. /m/ is less common before /u/, but otherwise very common with the other vowels;
7. /n/ is less common only when preceding /i/ and /u/;
8. // is the clearest case of a recent development of phonological contrastiveness; it is widely
more frequent preceding or following /i/. // can be contrastive only in some speech varieties, while in
others it only occurs adjacent to /i/. In older varieties of Apurinã (see Polak 1894 and Pickering 1964) //
does not distinguish words and is in complementary distribution with /n/, supporting an analysis suggesting
the recent development of its phonological status in some speech varieties;
9. /s/ is not attested in the data sample when preceding /i/. At this point, it is not clear whether
this simply constitutes a phonotactic constraint or a sound alternation that has been missing in my analysis.
Some additional data available confirm the rare occurrence of /s/ preceding /i/. In some of Pickering’s
(1964) data, /i/ corresponds to [] while preceding /s/;61810. // has a narrow distribution across speech communities following the same pattern as /t/ and
//, suggesting that palatal or palato-alveolar consonants occur more frequently preceding the vowel /i/;
11. /h/ is a clear case of a difference between speech varieties. /h/ does not exist in some speech
communities, and in those in which /h/ is attested, this consonant only occurs word initially or preceded by
the reduced form of the first person pronoun {no-};
12. /r/ is well attested across speech varieties without restriction on its distribution, except that it
never occurs word initially;
13. /j/ is more frequently found preceding /a/ and /u/, although, in very few cases, it also occurs
preceding /e/ (e.g. jejemna ‘“yeye” tree’). What is even rarer is the occurrence of /j/ before //, confirming
the phonological constraint described in (119) of chapter 2, section 2.5. There are rare occasions in which
/j/ occurs before /i/; however, speakers never actually distinguish /ji/ from the long vowel /i/;
14. /w/ is normally attested across speech communities in all environments, except preceding /o/;
As to the long vowels, nasal long vowels are more frequent than oral long nasals. The fact that long
nasal vowels are more frequent than long oral vowels follows naturally from the existence of derived long vowels,
as described under 2.1.1.4 in chapter 2.
Once we have established that the same phonological chart identified for one of the villages can be
distributionally attested in other speech communities, with very few exceptions, we would expect language
variation in Apurinã to consist of the alternation of phonetic values of certain phonologically less pertinent
elements within the language overall sound system. That is, basically the language varies its allomorphs
across speech communities without, however, varying much on its phonemes. The only clear exceptions
are //, which does not contrast with /n/ or /j/ in some speech varieties, and /h/, which is indubitably absent
in some speech communities.
Although a description of every speech community is not yet available, the data obtained from the
11 speech communities confirm overall the results described in chapter 2 for the Japiim speech community.
Nonetheless, it is important to mention again that this seems to be less true when we consider the speech of
the Apurinã people who, in different ways, have acquired Portuguese as their first language. In the Japiim
speech community there is one clear case of an Apurinã speaker who learned Apurinã only when he was
619already 10 years old. His phonology is slightly distinct from that of another Apurinã from the same
community who learned Apurinã as his first language. At this stage, however, such observations are still
impressionistic, since a detailed and systematic study of the Portuguese influence on the Apurinã
phonology of young speakers still is required.","[647, 648, 649, 650, 651]"
"2765.1.1.1 Intransitive Verbs
Intransitive (or monovalent) verbs are split into two classes: standard
intransitive or descriptive intransitive. It is important to take into account the
subclasses of verbs while doing a morphological analysis because they differ somewhat
either as to which verbal bound forms each subclass can take or as to the different
functions homophonous bound formatives have in each subclass.
5.1.1.1.1Standard Intransitive VerbsStandard intransitive verbs are the most typical monovalent verbs which express
events; these verbs lexically require one syntactic argument, and their only required
argument may co-occur with a subject coreferential pronominal marker (listed in Table 1)
on the verb if the subject is post-verbal. In the following examples (8) nota ‘1SG’, kuku
‘man’ and suto ‘woman’ have in common the property of being coreferential with the
prefixed pronominal markers in the verb, thus characterizing the verb as belonging to the
class of standard intransitive ones:
8a. Ø-upũ-pe
3M-die-PFTV
‘He/It has died.’
b. nh-irika nota
1SG-fall 1SG
‘I fell down.’
c. n-umaka-ko
1SG-sleep-FUT
‘I will sleep.’
d. u-muteka kuku
3M-run
man
‘The man ran.’277e. o-serena suto
3F-dance woman
‘The woman danced.’
f. o-apo-pe
3F-arrive-PFTV
‘She has arrived.’
As the examples in (8) illustrate, standard intransitive include verbs that take
patient-like subject (such as ‘die’ and ‘fall’), experiencer-like subject (such as ‘sleep’),
and agent-like subject (such as ‘run’, ‘dance’ and ‘arrive’). Therefore, the class of
meanings of these verbs cannot be established on the basis of the semantic roles of their
arguments.
5.1.1.1.2Descriptive Intransitive VerbsIn semantic terms, descriptive intransitive (hereafter descriptive) verbs differ
from standard intransitive verbs insofar as the descriptive intransitives are exclusively
property-referring words, while standard intransitives typically refer to events or, in a few
instances, states. In morphological terms, descriptive verbs follow a split-S pattern
(Andrews 1985:147-150) common in other Arawak languages (see Payne 1991:376),
dividing into two subclasses: subjective and objective (here used as purely mnemonic
labels). That is, the notional subjects of some descriptive verbs take subject
morphological markers, while the notional subjects of other descriptive verbs take object
morphological markers —both subject and object markers were listed in Table 1. Each
of the two sub-classes of descriptive verbs are further described and illustrated in the next
subsections.","[307, 308, 309]"
"2.3.1. Preliminaries
In terms of the most general definition, the term stress is here used to refer to the
perceived prominence associated with one (or more) syllables in a morpheme, word or in
larger units, and which can also be systematically associated with a cluster of
phonological phenomena. An in-depth description of stress marking patterns in Apurinã
is no simple matter and would require a more detailed analysis than the one I propose to
present here. In fact, the description of prosody (which includes stress and other
rhythmic structures) is still part of an on-going research and, as such, is the piece of the
Apurinã phonology that requires further investigation the most. The results presented
here constitute the generalizations that have been attested so far in the language, and are
restricted to the word stress, i.e. the perceived prominence associated with syllables at
91the level of the prosodic (i.e. phonological) word. (The distinction between grammatical
and phonological words is discussed in chapter 3). Therefore, unless noted otherwise, the
term “stress” is hereafter used to refer only to the word stress.
Word stress is one manifestation of culminativity, i.e. the assumption that “each
word has a single strongest syllable bearing the main stress (Hayes 1995:24, where
Liberman and Prince 1977:262 is cited as earlier source). Further research on stress in
clausal and phrasal units may reveal that additional rules and constraints are required in
order to account for stress marking patterns in contexts larger than words. By narrowing
the scope of the stress marking properties described here I intend to highlight the most
consistent results, presenting as preliminary any conclusion on properties of larger units
which only further research will clarify.
Before presenting the stress properties of Apurinã, one note about the definition of
stress is in order. It is apparent in the current linguistic literature that no agreement has
been reached as to an invariable phonetic correlate of stress cross-linguistically (Hayes
1995:5-8, Kenstowicz 1994:549-550). Hayes cites references on experimental research
in phonetics to state that “no one physical correlate can serve as a direct reflection of
linguistic stress levels” (Hayes 1995:5). Although Ladefoged still states that “[s]tressed
sounds are those on which the speaker expends more muscular energy” 1994:249, it is
not clear to me whether he believes “the increase in the flow of air out of the lungs” to be
a distinctive invariant cue of stress, or whether it is one of the stress properties that can
also be found to correlate with other phonological phenomena and that does not
constitute sufficient condition to define stress. The acoustic correlates of stress in
Apurinã are still under investigation. As a consequence, the “perceived prominence”
used here to phonetically define stress consists of the increase in the pitch and in the flow
92of air out of the lungs, as they can be observed by the trained ears of linguists. The
putative acoustic correlates of higher pitch and increase in the air flow would be,
respectively, higher frequency and higher amplitude; but these still require confirmation
from instrumental measurements and/or other experimental research methods.","[122, 123, 124]"
"299In addition to verbs with incorporated nouns such as those illustrated above, there
are rare examples of verbs that can be analyzed as consisting of a compound base plus a
verbalizer. An example of this is illustrated in (34), where yõka ‘spot’ and tsopa ‘leaf’
are shown in (34a) and (34b), respectively, to be noun roots. In (34c) a base consisting of
these two noun roots take the verbalizer -ta:
34a. i-yõka
3M-spot.of‘its/his spot’b. u-tsopa
3M-leaf.of‘its/his leaf’c. a-yõka-tsopa-ta
1PL-spot-leaf.of-VBLZ‘We wrote...’A verb with the structure of yõka-tsopa-ta would differ from verbs with incorporated
nouns in that, in contrast to the latter, the former cannot be “unincorporated”. So, the
root -tsopa in the verb yõka-tsopa-ta ‘to write’ cannot be “unincorporated” to form a
construction such as the one below:
35. *nhi-yõka-ta-ru
u-tsopa
1SG-spot.of-VBLZ-3M.O 3M-leaf.of(I write)Examples like (34c) would seem to require postulating a category of compound
verbs that would differ from verbs with incorporated regular nouns in that in the
compound noun there is no incorporated noun (i.e. a noun functioning as argument of a
verb it occurs inside of). However, it is still NOT possible to discard the possibility that
forms such yõka-tsopa-ta are actually lexicalized verbs. A more systematic investigation
of this specific type of verbs still needs to be done in order to decide whether
300yõka-tsopa-ta is an isolated example or whether there are other instances of verb forms
that can be analyzed as compound verbs. The simplest structure a verb with incorporated
regular nouns can have may be represented as in (36):
BRt
36. V → FRt  + N + ta
5.1.2.2 Verbs with Incorporated Classificatory Nouns
Verbs with incorporated classificatory nouns (ICN) are the types of verbs that
incorporate the C(lassificatory) N(oun)s described in 4.1.1.2., particularly the CN2s
described in 4.1.1.2.2-4.1.1.2.3. In section 4.1.1.2.2, CN2s were defined as the type of
inalienable nouns that can recur with a classificatory function as part of a productive
noun compound formation. ICNs occur productively incorporated into the verb in ways
analogous to the way CN2s occur productively as part of the productive noun compounds
described in 4.2.1. In the following examples, -ke, -pe, and -ã are classificatory nouns
that are incorporated into the verb:
37a. a-txirãka-ke-ta-ru
1PL-split-stick-VBLZ-3M.O‘We opened a long, thin, flexible object’b. nu-taka-pe-ta-ru
1SG-put-pulp-VBLZ-3M.O‘I put the paste object.’c. u-pokĩka-ã-ta
3M-leave-water-VBLZ‘It floated in the water.’The simplest structure verbs with ICNs can have may be represented as in (38):
BRt
38. V → FRt  + ICN + ta
301Furthermore, ICNs can be used with anaphorical-like functions insofar as they can
also either keep a copy non-incorporated in the same clause or be used anaphorically to
refer to a subset property of another nominal that occurs in the preceding discourse
(within or outside the same clause).3 In the example in (39a) the CN2 -ke occurs both
incorporated and as part of the noun form expressing the notional object, namely ãã-ke
‘stick’; and, in the (39b), -pe also occurs both incorporated and as part of the noun form
expressing the notional object, namely komuru-pe ‘manioc pulp’:
txirãka-ke-ta
39a. ata i-ye
ãã-ke
1PL 3M-PROX plant-stick split-stick-VBLZ
‘We split open the stick.’
b. ata komuru-pe
usonãka-pe-ta-ka
1PL manioc-pulp.of dry-pulp-VBLZ-CAUS
‘We put the manioc pulp to dry.’
In (40) clauses (a’-a”) occur in the same text, (a’) preceding (a”) in the discourse. In (a’)
the CN2 -pe ‘pulp of’ occurs as part of the productive compound noun komuru-pe
‘soft/paste-like. In (a”) the same -pe occur as an ICN in the verb base aminhãka-pe-ta ‘to
carry something which is paste-like’, thus referring back ‘soft/paste-like manioc’ through
its consistency property:
40a’. ata makatxa-ka
txa-ru
i-ye
komuru-pe…
1PL take.out-PRED AUX-3M.O M-DEM manioc-pulp.of
‘…(when it softens,) we take out the softened manioc (out of the water)…’3Notice, however, that the term ‘anaphor’ is here extended to included metonomy or other sort of relationships in
which a reference is made to a property of an tem in the preceding discourse, not to the item itself. Hence, the
anaphor described here differs slightly from that expressed by pronominal forms and, thus, understandingbly can be
argued by others as being outside the domain of anaphor per se.","[330, 331, 332, 333]"
"8.10.3 SO versus OS
Pickering also claimed that the sequence SO (i.e. NP-subject immediately
preceding NP-object) is ungrammatical. Indeed I have not attested VSO in texts, and at
least some speakers reject VSO in elicitation. Example (131) above was illustrative of
this ungrammaticality, and the example in (143) further supports Pickering’s observation.
The sentence in (143), is ungrammatical, as was the one in (131), because the NP-subject
precedes the NP-object. However, although SOV is extremely rare in the text material I
have gathered, some speakers accept SOV in elicitation, as illustrated in (126) (repeated
below as 144):551*s-V-o
S
O
143. o-txa-ru
suto

3F-do-3M.O woman 3M.SG
(The woman did it.)
S
O
V
144. ata uwa
maporoka
1PL 3M.SG root.up
‘We rooted it up.’
Aberdour (1985) also reports cases of SOV clauses in texts, except that in her data
SOV is only found in reported speech.","[582, 583]"
