"16.2. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order,
clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. However,
whereas head-final word order is obligatory in noun phrases and adjective
phrases, verb-final order is only the preferred word order in independent
sentences. Alternative orders are possible, especially in the colloquial language. The order of the other major constituents of the clause (arguments
and adjuncts) is quite free, although there is a strong tendency for the subject to precede the other arguments.",[318]
"16.1. Grammatical relations: the notion of subject
16.1.1. Subject properties
Notions such as subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. (i.e. grammatical
relations, or syntactic functions) are generally used sparingly in this book.
The reason is that their use is not as straightforward in role-dominated languages like Lezgian as it is in reference-dominated languages like English.
There are very few generalizations that need to be stated over grammatical
relations.
The subject is the most important grammatical relation, and I will mostly
be concerned with this notion in this section. There is some evidence, albeit
rather slight, that a notion of subject is needed in Lezgian grammar. The arguments that have subject status are the Absolutive argument of intransitive verbs, the Ergative argument of transitive verbs, and the Dative argument in the Affective Construction.
However, most of the properties that often serve to identify subjects in
other languages do not uniquely identify subjects in Lezgian. Following
Keenan (1976), we can divide subject properties into coding properties and
behavioral properties. Coding properties are case marking, subject-verb
agreement, word order and the like. Case marking would of course identify
the Absolutive argument both of intransitive and of transitive sentences as
the subject. However, case marking is not normally considered sufficient
evidence for grammatical relations in languages with ergative case marking.
Subject-verb agreement is lacking in Lezgian. There is some weak evidence
from word order that Ergative agents and Dative experiencers are both subjects, because both precede the Absolutive argument in the unmarked order:

Ibrahim'Mu'minat saw Ibrahim.'aku-na.see-AOR16.1. Grammatical relations295However, since word order is very flexible (especially the order of arguments and clausal adjuncts, cf. 16.2.), this is very weak evidence. It is just as
possible that the true word order generalization is a strong tendency for
topics to precede non-topics, and for agents and experiencers to be topics.
Behavioral properties have to do with behavior in valence-changing (or
relation-changing) operations and with behavior in various types of coreferential constructions. Valence-changing operations do not yield any criteria
in Lezgian, because the only valence-changing verbal categories, the
Causative and the Anticausative (cf. 10.1.-2.), affect only one type of argument (Causatives are formed only from intransitive verbs, Anticausatives
only from transitive verbs). It is only in coreferential constructions that we
begin to get some clearer evidence for a notion of subject in Lezgian, as discussed in the following two sections.
16.1.2. Evidence from coreferential constructions
Let us first consider constructions involving omission under coreference.
In such constructions, there is a controller and an (omitted) target. For instance, in English Maria promised Kim to meet Hans, the subject of to
meet is omitted under coreference with Maria; i.e. the subject of to meet is
the target and Maria (the subject of promised) is the controller of the omission.
Across languages, the controller of coreferential omission is very often
the subject. In Lezgian, too, subjects are commonly controllers. In (801a-c),
an Ergative argument, an intransitive Absolutive argument, and a Dative
experiencer control a complement clause target.

However, not only Ergatives, intransitive Absolutives, and Dative experiencers can control omitted targets. Other arguments that are salient in the
clause can do so as well, such as Genitive experiencers (802a) or Subelative
arguments (802b).

However, the order of the arguments with respect to each other seems to be
determined by information structure rather than by grammatical relations.
Given information tends to precede new information, and the subject simply is most often given information. In those relatively infrequent cases
where another argument is given and the subject is new, the subject follows
that argument:

say-FUTwunayou:ERGlah. (Du85,3:116)
say:IMPVWe'll tell you where the treasury is hidden, and you tell the king
that that treasury was hidden by jinns.'
When the Absolutive object is given information, the sentence can be
translated by means of a passive (as in 818a-b). When the given element is
not a direct object, other constructions (e.g. existential constructions) must
be used in the English translation:
(819) Abur.u-zthey-DATqwe-da,come-FUTgila k'walaxze-da,k'wal-e-nisa kapnowworkbe-FUTzibin.di-zpocket-DAThalaldulluxsalaryfuhouse-lNESS-and one chunk self.earned breadze-da. (HQ89:6)
be-FUT'They will now have work, there will be a salary coming into the
pocket, and a piece of self-earned bread will be in the house.'
Another reason for reversing the normal subject-first order may be the
heaviness of an argument. Heavy arguments tend to be placed at the margin
of the clause, i.e. clause-initially in verb-final clauses.","[320, 321]"
"16.2. Word order at the clause level30316.2.4. Discontinuous constituents?
While word order in Lezgian is generally rather free, there is a very strong
tendency for the elements of a constituent to be adjacent. Discontinuous
noun phrases, as can be found in languages like Latin or Warlpiri, are prohibited in Lezgian.
However, sometimes subordinate clauses appear to exhibit discontinuities. An example is (823) (cf. also (457a), (568a), (1156), (1163b)).
(823) Amni-wajaqwazar-izhe: Α BS who-ADEL stop-INFze-da? (K90,3:2)
can-FUT'Who will be able to stop him?'
According to the analysis of this grammar (cf. 20.2.2.), [am aqwazariz] 'to
stop him' constitutes a subordinate Infinitival complement clause, which is
an argument of the verb xun 'be able', and whose omitted subject is controlled by the ""subject"" of xun, niwaj 'who'. However, the argument of the
main verb, niwaj,
is in the middle of the subordinate clause [am
aqwazariz].
Since continuity is generally considered a strong argument for constituency, one might suspect that the analysis is not in fact correct, and that
sentences like (823) are not biclausal but monoclausal.
More research is needed to decide whether discontinuous complement
clauses are allowed or whether the analysis of complement clauses like (823)
has to be revised.","[322, 323]"
"Chapter 16
Syntax of the clauseThe preceding chapter on verbal valence contains the central information
on clause-internal syntax. This chapter deals with some further issues: the
problem of grammatical relations (especially the subject, 16.1.), word order at
the clause level (16.2.), and clausal adjuncts (16.3.).","[313, 314]"
"14.4. Word order in the noun phrase
Noun phrases are strictly head-final. All types of modifiers precede their
head: quantifiers (see 14.2.), appositions (see 14.3.), demonstratives (cf. 683),
adjective phrases (cf. 684), Genitive NPs (cf. 685), and relative clauses (see
19.1.).

The order of noun modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free,
and the generalizations below reflect only the orders that are used most
commonly. Native speakers tend to accept most possible orders. In many
cases there may be semantic differences between different orders (e.g. reflecting different scope relations), but they are too subtle to be described here.
14.4.1. The position of the Genitive NP
The Genitive NP generally precedes all other modifiers because otherwise
those modifiers could be taken as modifying the Genitive noun rather than
its head. In example (686), the Genitive NP precedes an adjective (a), a
demonstrative (b), a quantifier (c), a numeral (d), and even a relative clause
(e) (but see 14.4.2. for the order of relative clauses).

However, two types of Genitive NPs prefer a position closer to the head
noun: short pronominal Genitives (cf. 687) and non-referential Genitive
modifiers that correspond to English first compound members and to
Russian relational adjectives (cf. 688).","[279, 280]"

b. ithisjeke gatu-n
bigsummer-GENxali-jarmelon-PL'these big muskmelons (lit. summer melons)' (not: melons of this
big summer)
All these examples are syntactically ambiguous, but since the other reading
is extremely unlikely in (687) (personal pronouns are hardly ever modified),
and non-referential Genitives form fixed expressions with their head nouns
in (688), the danger of confusion is small.
When a plausible meaning results, two Genitive NPs may modify the
same head noun:
(689) a. öiawe:GEN t h a t6'aw.a-n predsedatel'
time-GENchairperson(R66:12)'our chair of that time'
b. ziI:GENgat.u-nsummer-GENkanikul-arvacation-PL(M83:64)'my summer vacations'
14.4.2. The position of the relative clauseThe participial relative clause is generally the first constituent of its NP because of its heaviness. If other modifiers preceded the relative clause, these
would be relatively far away from their head nouns. E.g.
(690) wa-ltapSurmiS-da-j[you-SRESS entrust-FUT-PTP]sa c'iji kar (E56:14)
one newjob'a new job that will be entrusted to you'
When this preference is in conflict with the preference that the Genitive NP
should be the first constituent of the NP (14.4.1.), both orders are possible,
and the order which causes least ambiguity in the context wins out.","[280, 281]"
"16.2. Word order at the clause level29916.2.1. Position of the verb
The finite verb is in the sentence-final position in the overwhelming majority of cases, at least in the written standard language. This is illustrated by
(810) and by many other examples in this grammar.
(810) Kamalov.aKamalov(ERG)itim.di-zstol.di-qflman-DATäkatable-POESSqalur-na.p l a c e show-AOR(M90:76)'Kamalov showed the man a seat at the table.'
In subordinate clauses the clause-final position of the verb is practically
obligatory, as illustrated in (811) and in many other examples, especially in
Ch. 19-21.

However, there are certain conditions under which non-verb-final order
in independent sentences is possible or even required. One such condition
is in reporting clauses where the object argument represents direct speech.
This appears to be something of a literary convention (much like in
English), but in narrative prose writing it is practically exceptionless. The
reporting verb follows the direct speech immediately, followed by other
constituents of the clause.

21.5.4. Other causal clauses
In a very bookish style, the particle £i can be used in combination with a

It takes a Masdar clause in the Absolutive case. ΡαίαΖ-clauses may have a

a salient argument in the superordinate clause, as in (1090).","[410, 411]"

one-place predicates (e.g. lazim [...VMSD] 'it is necessary to V ' ) , but they may
have an optional Dative experiencer argument which then controls the subject position of the Masdar (e.g. lazim EQAT [0SUBJ—VMSD] 'it is necessary for

In complement clauses with manipulative meaning (other than the
causative verb tun, cf. 20.2.4.), the verb is in the Absolutive Masdar form
and the complement subject position is controlled by the manipulee argument of the verb, i.e. an Adelative argument or a Dative argument.

Perhaps the rule reflects an earlier state of the language (and GadZiev's own
intuitions) and has disappeared under the influence of Russian. Thus, examples as in (926), where GadZiev's rule is violated, are quite normal nowadays. In (926a), an intransitive and a transitive verb are conjoined, (926b)

and Maxaikala who spent many hours with me, patiently answering questions whose points were mostly obscure to them: Muminat M. Gusejnova,
Maisa Xalimbekova, Muradxan Axmedov, Fizuli and Salbuzdag Kurbanov,
Nizam Zagirov, Etibar Bagirov, Farid I. Gusejnov.
I am very grateful to Professor Axmedula G. Gjul'magomedov for his
hospitality in Maxaikala, to Muminat and Ibrahim Gusejnov for making
me feel at home in their house, and to Farid Gusejnov for his friendship.
I also profited from discussions with Bukar B. Talibov, Enver M. Sejxov
and RadZidin I. Gajdarov in Maxaikala, and with Sandro V. Kodzasov,
Mixail E. Alekseev, Vjaieslav A. Cirikba, and Aleksandr E. Kibrik in
Moscow.
Georg Bossong read the whole manuscript and suggested various improvements. Sandro Kodzasov, Matthias Butt, and Michael Job read earlier
versions of the phonological chapters and provided numerous valuable
suggestions. And special thanks are due to Matthias Butt for solving all my
computational problems.
This work would not have been possible without the generous financial
and organizational support of the German Academic Exchange Service
(DAAD). I thank Moscow State University and especially the Linguistics
Department for their hospitality (Irina Μ. Kobozeva, Aleksandr E. Kibrik).
And I would also like to mention some of my Moscow friends and colleagues who made my stay there such a unique experience: Sergej A.
Krylov, Mira Β. Bergel'son, Andrej A. Kibrik, Vladimir A. Plungian, Ol'ga
Ju. Boguslavskaja, Igor' M. Boguslavskij, Yakov G. Testelec, Leonid I.
Kulikov, Vera I. Podlesskaya and (from Leningrad/St.Petersburg) Vladimir
P. Nedjalkov.
Most of the actual writing of this grammar was done while I had the privilege to work in the ideal environment of the European Science Foundation
Programme in Language Typology (EUROTYP), together with its Programme Director Ekkehard König and dozens of linguists from all over
Europe, whose interest in Lezgian has always kept me motivated.
Finally, I have to thank Hans-Jürgen Sasse, George Smith, Stefanie
Eschenlohr, and Albrecht Hofheinz for help of various kinds.

The principles that determine which syntactic elements can be controller
and target of coreferential omission are very similar for complement clauses
and for adverbial clauses. The main difference is that some types of complement clause constructions always or typically involve particular coreferential a r g u m e n t s , so that coreferential omission is more g r a m m a t i c i z e d .
Thus, while both (1136) (a) and (b) are possible, (1137b), without omission of
the (reflexive) pronoun, is quite unusual and would only be u s e d for emphasis.

Omission is practically obligatory in (1137a) because the girl's ability only
concerns her own (potential) actions (a sentence like T h e girl is able for you
to help her' w o u l d be nonsensical). However, in complement clause constructions where the complement subject m a y or may not be coreferential40822. Coreferencewith an argument of the higher clause, the situation is again as with adverbial clauses: omission is again optional.

Complement clauses can roughly be divided into subject-controlled and
object-controlled clauses. Some complement-taking verbs that take subjectcontrolled complements are k'an- 'want', d- 'know how to', werdiS Aun 'get
used to' (with infinitival complements, 20.2.1.-3.); dawamarun
'continue',
aqwazarun
'stop', q'et'un 'decide' (with Masdar complements, 20.3.3-4.).
Some complement-taking verbs that take object-controlled complements
are tun 'make, cause', öirun 'teach' (with Infinitival complements, 20.2.4.);
t'alabun 'ask', bujrugun 'order', qadaga awun 'forbid' (with Masdar complements, 20.3.2.).
Besides controllers that are subjects in the sense of 16.1., there are also
other salient arguments that are typically animate and that can act as controllers of omitted complement clause subjects, e.g. the Adelative argument
of fun 'be able', the Superelative argument of alaq'un 'be able to' (cf. 20.2.2.),
the Genitive argument of rik'elaj alatun (cf. 20.2.3.).
Finally, there are complement clause constructions which never show
coreferential omission because the complement clause is the only argument
of the complement-taking verb, e.g. baUamiSun
'begin' (20.2.5.), lazim
'necessary' (20.3.1.).","[426, 427, 428]"

Verbal valence15.1. Verbal valence patterns: introduction
Verbal valence patterns are represented here in the following format:
V (ACASEI/ BCASE2/···)where V stands for the verb, and A and Β stand for arguments in the case
indicated by the subscript (the order of the arguments is arbitrary). The letters used as variables for arguments are arbitrary and serve only to distinguish different arguments. However, I will often use letters that can be
thought of as mnemonic for particular semantic roles (A: ""agent"", T:
""theme"", L: ""location"", E: ""experiencer"", R: ""recipient""). Otherwise no attempt is made to systematically describe the semantic roles expressed by the
arguments; this information is left implicit in the translations of the individual verbs.
Let us take a concrete example: The verb ilisun has the valence pattern:
V (AERG/ TABS/ LSRESS)and means Ά presses L by putting Τ in contact with L (= A presses L with
T)'. This means that it has an (""agent"") argument in the Ergative case which
corresponds to the subject of 'press' in the translation, a (""theme"") argument
in the Absolutive case which corresponds to the object of 'put in contact
with', and a (""location"") argument in the Superessive case corresponding to
the object of 'press'. This is all the information contained in a valence
frame, and it is sufficient, for example, to obtain the correct translation of
the following sentence:
(717) Adahe(ERG)knopka.da-lbutton-SRESSt'ubilis-na. (R66:9)finger press-AOR'He pressed the button by putting his finger in contact with it.'
(= 'He pressed the button with his finger.'
Lit. 'He pressed his finger on the button.')15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patterns
There are very tight restrictions on possible verbal valence patterns, especially the following:
(i) There are no verbs that take fewer than one argument. Weather situations (rain, snow, etc.), which are expressed by zero-argument verbs in many15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patterns269languages, are expressed as 'rain is falling' (marf qwazwa),
etc. (However,
predicative adjectives may be subjectless, cf. 17.3.)
(ii) There are no verbs that take more than three arguments.
(iii) Most of the valence patterns contain an Absolutive argument. There
are a few exceptions which belong to the ""non-standard valence patterns""
and are discussed in 15.4. below.
(iv) For each intransitive valence pattern with an Absolutive argument
there is a corresponding transitive valence pattern which contains the same
arguments plus an Ergative argument.
(v) Except for the purely adnominal Genitive case and the rare Directive
cases, all cases occur in at least one valence pattern together with an
Absolutive argument (but see 15.3.15. for ""Genitive arguments"").
Thus, the valence patterns in (718) are the most typical, and they are
therefore called ""standard valence patterns"" here. Each of them is exemplified in one subsection of 15.3.

restrictions on the form that the adverbial will take).
V (TABS, L A D V)V (A E R G , TABS, L a d v )(15.3.14.)In addition, there are two groups of ""non-standard valence patterns"". In
the first group, there is a Dative argument with subject properties (15.4.1.),
and in the second group, the Absolutive argument has been incorporated
into the verb so that there is no Absolutive argument in the valence pattern
(""Absolutive absorption"", 15.4.2.1.).
The valence patterns of verbs that take clausal arguments (=complement
clauses) have not been taken into account here. For such complement-taking verbs, see Ch. 20.
The general principles to which Lezgian valence patterns conform
(especially (i)-(v) above) are not particularly exotic or exceptional. Aside
from Ergativity, there are only two features that set Lezgian off from the familiar European languages: Dative experiencers and consistent Absolutive27015. Verbal valencethemes. Thus, in an experiential verb like akun 'see' and other experiential
expressions (cf. 15.4.1.), the experiencer is expressed in the Dative case:
(719) Zamira.di-zDianaZamita-DATDianaaku-na.
see-AOR'Zamira saw Diana, (lit. Diana was visible to Zamira.)'
And themes are consistently in the Absolutive case, even where a patient
argument is also present and would be the direct object in the familiar
European languages. In Lezgian, this patient is expressed in one of the local
cases. For example, the patient arguments of the verbs 'stroke' and 'sweep'
appear in the Adelative and Superelative cases, respectively, in the following examples (an analogous example is (717) above).
(720) Emirmet.a
Emirmet(ERG)qhilqw.e-wajgilgiic'-na. (Q81:113)cheek-ADELhandstroke-AOR'Emirmet stroked her cheek with his hand.' (Lit. 'Emirmet stroked his
hand along her cheek.')
(721) Aminat.a
Aminat(ERG)k'wal.e-lajkkulelä-na. (Talibov 1958:241)room-SRELbroomsweep-AOR'Aminat swept the room with a broom.' (Lit. 'Aminat swept the
broom through the room.')
In the familiar European languages, the Lezgian local patients have to be
rendered as direct objects, and the Lezgian Absolutive themes correspond to
instrumental phrases. These instrumental phrases sound somewhat redundant in the translations of (720M721) because the verbal actions ('stroke',
'sweep') are such that they are exclusively or typically carried out with these
instruments. But this is not the case in Lezgian because quite generally verb
meaning is more general than in the familiar European languages. For example, gilc'un not only means 'stroke', but also 'wipe' (stoldiwaj pek giic'un
'wipe a table with a cloth') or 'rub', and elägun not only means 'sweep', but
also 'wave (with a cap)' and 'nod (one's head)'.
These characteristics of Lezgian valence patterns can be generalized and
we can say that Lezgian shows a tendency toward a closer correspondence
between semantic roles and case-marking: Agents are always in the Ergative
case, themes are always in the Absolutive, recipients and experiencers are
always in the Dative, patients are always in one of the local cases. This is in
marked contrast to the familiar European languages, where nominative
subjects can be agents, themes, experiencers, and sometimes even patients,
accusative direct objects can be themes, patients, or experiencers, etc. It is
true that there are exceptions in Lezgian as well; for instance, the Absolutive
argument of kiligun (CABS/ DDAT) ' C looks at D' would appear to be an agent
rather than a theme, and Lezgian also has metaphorical expressions like i
banka.di pud litr q'ada (Talibov & Gad2iev 1966:207) 'this can holds three
liters'. But it cannot be denied that there is a tendency toward a closer link
between semantic roles and case-marking, so that we can call Lezgian a
""role-dominated language"" (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984, A. E. Kibrik 1980b).","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"(J89:24)do-FUT-CND] know-IMPF-NEG-PSTH e didn't know what to do in order for Ali to stay.'
21.6.2. The Infinitive
The Infinitive (Imperfective converb) is used only in short clauses that express the goal or purpose of a movement action. Infinitival purpose clauses
are very unlikely to have a subject of their own, and their subject is as a rule
controlled by the subject of the movement action.

"1.3. A user's guide to this grammar
This book is intended as a reference grammar of Lezgian for linguists who
wish to learn more about Lezgian grammar as a whole or about particular
aspects of it.
Since it was written for linguists, the grammar presupposes familiarity
with a large number of fundamental grammatical notions which greatly facilitate the concise formulation of grammatical regularities. However, it
contains no framework-specific jargon, idiosyncratic formalisms, or other
unnecessary obstacles.
1.3.1. User-friendly features
An attempt has been made to make this grammar maximally user-friendly
even for readers who need a particular piece of information (e.g. for a crosslinguistic investigation) and have no time to wade through the whole
grammar. This grammar has the following features that make it easy to use
as a reference work:
(A) Morpheme-by-morpheme glosses with brackets marking subordinate
clauses for better readability (cf. 1.3.5.).
(B) A detailed subject index which, in addition to normal entries referring
to places in the book, contains entries that do not occur elsewhere in the
book. Such entries are names of grammatical phenomena that do not occur
in the language. Thus, looking up the subject index suffices to find out that
Lezgian has no passive, no dual, no tones. There are of course no negative
statements about these categories in the grammar, and since the mere absence of a category in the index proves nothing, the negative information in
the index might be useful.
(C) An index to the example sentences. Since the examples (most of
which were taken from original Lezgian texts) usually show other interesting phenomena in addition to the point which they illustrate in the particular place in the text, such an index makes a lot of additional information
available. By looking up the number of an example in the index, the reader1.3. A user's guide to this grammar9can find up to twenty more examples elsewhere in the grammar that illustrate the same point.
(D) A more or less complete bibliography of scholarly works on Lezgian.
Most of these are not mentioned in the text, but a reader who is interested
in further information or different points of view is given the chance to
look them up. The subject index simultaneously serves as an index to the
bibliography. This step was taken so as not to clutter the text with references
that few readers will find useful because most of the publications are difficult to get outside of Daghestan.
(E) An index to the grammatical morphemes of Lezgian.
1.3.2. Structure of the grammar
The structure of this grammar follows the well-established traditional order:
phonology — morphology — syntax — texts. This ensures that the amount
of information that is presupposed in a given section but comes later in the
book is minimized.
The morphological chapters deal with the form and the meaning of the
grammatical items of the language. For inflectional categories, the inflection
as a whole is first described, followed by a description of the meanings of the
individual inflectional categories. For derivational categories, form and
meaning are treated together.
While the morphology takes the analytical perspective (from form to
function), the syntax takes the synthetic perspective (from function to form),
with chapter topics such as coordination, relative clauses, complement
clauses, adverbial clauses, coreference, questions, and comparison. All these
are taken as functional notions. For example, participial relative clauses and
correlative relative clauses show no formal similarities, but they are treated
together in Ch. 19 because of their similar function.
Thus, this grammar to some extent fulfills the theoretical requirement to
present the grammatical information both from an analytical and from a
synthetic perspective (von der Gabelentz 1901, Lehmann 1980). For example,
the functions of the Dative case are described twice: First from an analytical
perspective in the chapter on nominal inflection (7.2.2.4.); and then from a
synthetic perspective in the sections on verbal valence (15.3.2., 15.4.1.), on
adjectival valence (14.5.1.1.), and on spatial and temporal adverbials
(16.3.1.1., 16.3.2.1.). Similarly, the functions of the Aorist converb are described twice: First in the chapter on verbal inflection (9.9.4.), and then in
the sections on adverbial clauses (21.1.) and on complement clauses (20.6.1.2.). Sometimes only cross-references are made to avoid unnecessary repetitions.
However, this grammar, too, has an analytical bias. Not everything is described from a synthetic point of view. For example, there is no function-toform treatment of tense meanings, or of number meanings. For such phenomena, the form-to-function description must suffice.","[28, 29]"

Adverbial clausesJust like the other dependent constituents, Lezgian adverbial clauses as a
rule precede their head, i.e. the verb of the superordinate clause. Since they
are generally heavy, they tend to precede all other elements of the superordinate clause (cf. 1047). Less commonly the adverbial clause is embedded in

Adverbial clauses show several kinds of formal marking:
(A) Special verbal affixes, called converbs: -(i)z, -na, -la, -waldi, -nmazdi,
-rdawaj,
-daldi.
(B) Postpositions governing noun clauses of the substantivized participle
type (20.4.) or the Masdar type (20.3.): q'uluqh 'after', iniqh 'since', patal 'in
order to'. When used in this way, the postpositions could also be regarded as
subordinating conjunctions.
(C) Nouns with very general meaning which are the heads of participial
relative clauses: ö'awuz 'at the time (when)'.
(D) The Conditional mood marker -t'a (9.3.4.3., 9.8.5.), suffixed to a finite
verb or to an Aorist participle.
(E) Subordinating conjunctions that introduce the clause. These are loans
from Persian, and only eger 'if is widely used.
(F) luhuz llahana, converbs of luhun 'say'.
The subject of adverbial clauses is often omitted under co-reference with
a noun phrase of the superordinate clause. See 22.2. for details.","[394, 395]"
"1.2. An overview of Lezgian grammar
This section is an introduction to the typologically most striking features of
Lezgian. Detailed information on each topic can be found in later chapters.
1.2.1. Phonology and morphophonemics
Lezgian has six phonemic vowels which form an asymmetric system which
is typologically rather unusual. Distinctive length of /a/ and /as/ is marginal.
iey
aeu
aWith its 54 members, the Lezgian consonant inventory is quite rich.
There are 34 occlusives, in six places of articulation (labial, dental, dental sibilant, postalveolar sibilant, velar, uvular) and four series (voiced, voiceless
unaspirated, voiceless aspirated, voiceless ejective). Dental, velar, and uvular obstruents have a labialized and a non-labialized variant.

Until recently, Lezgian had only syllables of the structure CV, CVC, and
CVCC. The last type occurs only at the end of a morpheme (e.g. /wertfh/ 'hen',
/halth-zawa/ 'meets'), and morpheme-internal consonant clusters (CVC-CV...)
are restricted to a few types in native words.
Quite recently Lezgian has undergone a sound change of vowel syncope
that eliminated high vowels in pretonic position between voiceless obstruents, e.g.
/tfhu'xun/
/sv'pekh/
/kn'tf'e/
/sith'%a/>
>
>
>Afhxun/
/spekh/
/k^tf'e/
/st^a/'comb'
'mulberry'
'afraid'
brother'1.2. An overview of Lezgian grammar3A s a result of this change, which lacks uniformity and is apparently still in
progress, a large number of new morpheme-initial consonant clusters has
arisen. In addition, the syncopated vowels often leave the preceding consonant labialized (in the case of syncopated Inf) or palatalized (in the case of /i/)
or both (in the case of /y/), so that a whole new class of palatalized and labialized-palatalized voiceless obstruents has come into being. This change complicates the description of Lezgian phonology considerably.
Another prominent feature of Lezgian is the occurrence of various consonant alternations in nouns. The Absolutive Singular form, which ends in
zero, often differs from the other forms, e.g.
Word-final Ejective Aspiration
/ne't'er/'lice'/net*1/'louse'/t'ab/'block (Abs.)'Word-final Ejective Voicing
/t'a'p'uni/'block (Erg.)'Word-final Unaspirated Voicing
/tse'kwer/'ants'/tsegw/'ant'Pre-obstruent Unaspirated Aspiration
/tsykh/'flower'/tshlflcwer/'flowers'Lezgian also shows palatal (/e, i, y/ vs. /a, u[) and labial (/u, y/ vs. Of) v o w e l
harmony, but only in the first two syllables of a word. For instance, the
oblique stem suffix -Uni has the alternants /-ini/, /-uni/, /-yni/:

from Arabic may also be stressed on the third syllable.
ak'äzarun

hukumät'bow'
'swallow'
'government' ( < Arabichukuumat)Suffixes are of two types: stress-neutral and stress-attracting. Stress-neutral suffixes do not bear stress. Since roots are commonly monosyllabic and
quite a f e w stress-neutral suffixes may f o l l o w a root, polysyllabic w o r d s
stressed on the first syllable are not uncommon, e.g.
f!4£-zawa
hält-nawa-j-bur-u-kaj'is crying'
'about those w h o have met'41. IntroductionMost stress-attracting suffixes can follow only monosyllabic roots, resulting
in words stressed on the second syllable.

'having gone'1.2.2. Morphology
Lezgian morphology is overwhelmingly suffixing and agglutinating.
Nouns, adjectives, and verbs can be easily distinguished by morphological
criteria.
Nouns are inflected for number (Singular, Plural), case (Absolutive,
Ergative, Genitive, Dative, Essive, Elative, Directive), and localization (Ad,
Sub, Post, Super, In). The locative cases Essive, Elative, and Directive occur
in combination with the localizations (Ad-essive, Sub-elative, Super-directive, etc.). All cases other than the Absolutive are based on a special oblique
stem whose suffix is idiosyncratic for many nouns. An example (hül 'sea'):

hill-er-ajThe locative cases in combination with the localizations can express various local relations. However, local relations are more often expressed by
postpositions, and noun inflections tend to express more abstract relations.
The only inflections of adjectives are the substantivizing suffix -di (e.g.
c'iji 'new', c'iji-di 'new one') the adverbial suffixes -(di)z / -dakaz
(e.g.jawaS
'slow', jawa$-diz 'slowly').
Verbs are inflected for tense-aspect, negation, several mood forms and
various non-finite forms. There are no person-number agreement forms.
The most important inflected verb forms are (from gun 'give'):1.2. An overview of Lezgian grammar

ta-ga-j-laThere is little derivational morphology in Lezgian. The most important
nominal derivational suffix is the abstract suffix -wal (c'iji-wal 'new-ness').
Verbs can be derived from verbs by means of the causative suffix -(a)r
0aqwaz-un 'stop (intr.)', aqwaz-ar-un 'stop (tr.)'). Some derivational affixes
have been borrowed along with loanwords and are so common that they
must be considered Lezgian affixes, e.g. nominal -6i (e.g. lawga-ü
'proud
person'), adjectival -lu, -suz (e.g. meSreblu
'pleasant', me Srebsuz
'unpleasant'), verbal -lamiSun (e.g. leke-lami§un 'stain, soil').
1.2.3. Syntax
Word order patterns in Lezgian are overwhelmingly head-final. This order
is obligatory in noun phrases (Genitive-noun, adjective-noun, numeralnoun, demonstrative-noun, etc.), adjective phrases, and postpositional
phrases, and it is preferred for clauses. However, alongside SOV order other
orders are also possible, especially in the spoken language.
The case-marking patterns in clauses is uniformly ergative, as shown in
(2) (for notational conventions used in example sentences, see 1.3.4.-5.).
(2) a. Stxak'wal.i-zbrother(ABS) house-DATxta-na.return-AORThe brother came back home.'","[22, 23, 24, 25]"
"14.3. Apposition259However, the Russian order ""given name - surname"" is also common.
When this order is chosen, the given name is in apposition and the surname inflects for case (cf. the examples in the newspaper text, 25.5.).
Appositions where no proper name is involved are much rarer. Some
examples:
(681) a. zidust-arI:GEN friend-PLniik'-er.i-z (M83:44)
bird-PL-DAT'to my friends the birds'
b. Dideq'iigür.disa gweö'imother hedgehog(ERG) one l i t t l emurmur

c. Isabeg.a-n

In connection with pronouns of the 1st and 2nd person, postposed appositions occur:

ANTIC-IMPF'The fish jump upward in order to get across these falls.'
Less common variants of patal are the Superdirective form pataldi 'for' (cf.
553), which also takes an Absolutive argument, and the Postelative form
pataqhaj
(cf. 554), which takes a Genitive argument.

"Ali(ERG) selfbeat-IMPF'Ali beats himself.'
b. Nabisat.a-zwit güzgü.d-aNabisat-DATself mirror-INESSakwa-zwa.see-IMPF'Nabisat sees herself in the mirror.'
Much more frequently it is a Genitive modifier of a noun phrase, e.g. in examples (1141b-d), (1142a-c) above. It may also be the argument of a postposition:
(1152) Nuralibuba.diNuralifather(ERG)öantawiöi-nbagself-GENwilikbeforeecig-na. (M83:74)
place-AOR'Father Nurali put the bag in front of him.'
The reflexive pronoun is not clause-bound. It may occur in a subordinate
clause when the antecedent is in the superordinate clause. The examples below also show that linear order is irrelevant: The reflexive pronoun may
precede or follow its antecedent.
(1153) Adverbial clause

In relative clauses the reflexive pronoun may also occupy the position of
the relativized constituent and may thus function as a resumptive pronoun
(cf. GadZiev 1954:152-153). This device is used especially when it would
otherwise be unclear which is the relativized constituent (cf. also 19.1.1.).

Unlike other complements marked by luhun, these complements have fact

and likewise with other emotional predicates.

restricted.

muallimwal
awun 'work as a teacher', regiixbanwile k'walaxun 'work as a miller'. That
-wile in such constructions is a sort of ""functive case"" suffix can be seen in

However, since the information conveyed by the personal pronoun is
very often recoverable from the context, the anaphoric pronoun can also be
omitted. This type of pronoun dropping is particularly frequent in dialogs
and in informal narratives. It occurs much more rarely in more formal
styles such as newspaper articles or technical texts. In the following examples, pronoun dropping is indicated by square brackets in the translations.

Dropping of personal pronouns is also possible and common with first and
second person pronouns. (Cf. also 9.8.1. on the omission of the second person pronoun in Imperatives.)

"15.5. Free omission of arguments
The arguments specified in a verb's valence pattern must normally be present for the sentence to be grammatical. However, arguments can be omitted under certain conditions. The most common reason for the absence of
an argument is pronoun dropping (22.1.).
In this section I describe cases of missing arguments that cannot be recovered from the discourse context, but that do not involve a different valence
pattern either (thus contrasting with labile verbs, 15.6.).
A very common type of argument omission is the omission of the subject
argument (cf. 16.1. for the notion of 'subject'). The interpretation is 'an unspecified participant' or 'people in general'. When the verb is transitive,
such subjectless sentences are best translated by means of passive sentences:
(778) a. Rossija.di-n
Russia-GENleiber-r.i-nfarmer-PL-GENassocijacija

Not only the Ergative subject of transitive verbs can be freely omitted with
the same interpretation, but also the Absolutive subject of intransitive
verbs. This shows that the omissibility of the Ergative argument in sentences like (778) cannot be due to a special peripheral status of Ergative arguments (as claimed by Mel'iuk 1988). Languages that lack a subjectless pas-28815. Verbal valencesive, like English, must resort to expressions like 'one' in translating such
Lezgian sentences.

That the same phenomenon is involved both in the omission of Ergative
and Absolutive arguments is confirmed by examples where both an
Ergative subject and an Absolutive subject are omitted in the same sentence
and with the same interpretation:

"Since Lezgian prefers verb-final word order, background-first constructions

or the focus of a parametric question, as in (977), a wh-cleft is impossible in

"34819. Relative clauses19.3.1. The nominal predicative substantivized participle
This construction is used to characterize the subject by means of an event in
which it participates. In contrast to the corresponding finite sentences, such
sentences do not express a particular, temporally localizable situation, but
rather a timeless characteristic feature of the subject. For example, sentence
(963)
(963) Halimat
Halimatgimnastika.da-lmaSgulze-zwa-j-di[gymnastics-SRESSoccupiedbe-IMPF-PTP-SBST.SG] COPja. (DD85,3:23)'Halimat occupies herself with gymnastics.' (lit. 'Halimat is one who
(or: is such that she) occupies herself with gymnastics.')
conveys an important characteristic of Halimat, whereas (964) would express
either an ongoing or a habitual event.
(964) HalimatHalimatgimnastika.da-lgymnastics-SRESSma$guloccupiedie-zwa.be-IMPF'Halimat is doing gymnastics.' 'Halimat (habitually) does gymnastics.'
The semantic difference can be quite subtle, but with transitive predicates
(as in (965)) there is a drastic syntactic difference: The subject of a transitive
verb appears in the Absolutive case, as is normal for a subject of a copula
clause.

Since Lezgian participles are not inherently oriented, the Absolutive subject of the predicative substantivized participle construction does not have
to correspond to the participle's subject. Example (966) shows sentences
where the subject corresponds to the participle's Absolutive direct object.
Such sentences are best translated by passive sentences, but the Lezgian construction is not passive at all.","[367, 368]"

The referential control of reflexive pronouns works very similarly:
although reflexives are most commonly controlled by subjects, they may
also be controlled by other salient arguments (see 22.4.).
A property that is much more restricted than controllership is the property of being the target of coreferential omission. As the above examples
show, the omitted argument is generally the Ergative or Absolutive subject.
Coreferential omission of Dative experiencers is also possible:
(803) a. Gada.di-z

gladbecome-AOR'When seeing this snake-exterminating army, Alaquli became
infinitely glad.'
But even though the property of being a target of omission is a better candidate for a true subject property, it is not completely reliable because of the
general freedom of omitting pronominal arguments when they are recoverable from the context (cf. 22.1.). Thus, even here it is quite possible that
other, pragmatic factors are at work. And Kibrik (1980a) reports that even
non-subject arguments can sometimes be omitted optionally (Kibrik's examples are from the Axceh dialect; I have substituted the standard spelling).
(804) a. RuS.a-z
girl-DATgada.diwiö/0gata-zkiö'e-zwa.[boy(ERG)s e l f / 0 ( A B S ) beat-INF] fear-IMPF'The girl is afraid that the boy will beat her.'

girl-DAT[boy-DATs e l f / 0 ( A B S ) see-INF]fear-IMPF'The girl is afraid that the boy will see her.'
Nevertheless, there is one coreferential construction that seems to give
reliable evidence for subjecthood in Lezgian. It distinguishes between
Ergatives, intransitive Absolutives, and Dative experiencers (i.e. subjects)16.1. Grammatical relations297and all other arguments, and is apparently not semantically or pragmatically
determined. This is switch-reference with 'want'-complements.
16.1.3. Evidence from switch-reference with 'want'
As is noted in 20.2.1., complements to k'an- 'want' are in the Infinitive form
when the subject of the complement clause is coreferential with the wanter
(i.e. the matrix subject). This condition can only be stated in terms of the notion of subject. (805a) shows a coreferentially omitted Ergative complement
subject, and (805b) shows an omitted Absolutive complement subject.
(805) a. Nabisat.a-zktabNabisat-DAT[bookk'el-izk'an-zawa.read-INF]want-IMPFTSIabisat wants to read a book.'
b. Nabisat.a-zqhür.e-zNabisat-DATk'an-zawa.[laugh-INF]want-IMPF'Nabisat wants to laugh.'
But when the complement subject is not coreferential with the matrix subject, the complement verb is in the Aorist converb form (cf. 806). The
Infinitive form is not possible here.
(806) a. Nabisat.a-zrukaNabisat-DATktab[girl(ERG) bookk'el-na/*k'el-izk'an-zawa.read-AOC/read-INF]want-IMPFTSJabisat wants her daughter to read a book.'
b. Nabisat.a-z

xta-na/*xkwe-z
Nabisat-DAT[sonhouse-DATcome.back-AOC/come.back-INF]k'an-zawa.
want-IMPFTSIabisat wants her son to come home.'
This is thus a sort of syntactic switch-reference system in which the
Infinitive is the same subject form and the Aorist converb is the different
subject form. This criterion clearly shows that the 'direct object' Absolutive
behaves differently from the Ergative and and Absolutive subject:
(807) *Musa.di-z
Musa-DATdide.di[mother(ERG)seher.di-z
town-DATraqur-izsend-INF]k'an-zawa.want-IMPF'Musa wants to be sent to town by his mother.'
It also shows that the Dative experiencer of experience verbs has subject status (cf. 808a) and the Absolutive stimulus does not have subject status (cf.
808b).","[315, 316, 317]"
"355in such(983) a. Gadadi didediz, — Zun Seherdiz fida, — lahana.
The boy said to his mother: ""I will go to town.""'
b. *Gadadi, — Zun k'wale amuq'da!, — harajna.

c. Gada.di, — Zun
boy(ERG)I:ABSk'wal-eamuq'-da!,— laha-nahouse-INESS stay-FUTsay-AOCharaj-na.scream-AORThe boy screamed: ""I will stay at home!""'
The same is true for indirect speech: The zero strategy is possible only with
luhun itself, whereas other verbs must use the Zuftu/i-strategy. In (984), the
use of the reflexive pronoun shows that we are dealing with indirect speech.
(984) a. Gada.didide.di-z,boy(ERG)mother-DATwie[selfSeher.di-z

b. *Gada.diboy(ERG)wid k'wal-eamuq'-daharaj-na.[self house-INESS stay-FUT]scream-AOR'The boy screamed that he would stay at home!""'
Even the Imperative may be used in indirect speech. Examples such as
the following show that the direct-indirect speech division is not as sharp in
Lezgian as in the familiar languages.
(985) a. Belkinilk'.rewiöi-zsa k'usmaybe bird(ERG) [self-DAT one piecefuceluhu-zwa-t'a?bread give:IMPV] say-IMPF-CND'Maybe the bird asks for a piece of bread? (lit. says, give itself a

20.2. The Infinitive
The infinitive is used mainly in complement clauses with irrealis modality,
i.e. complement clauses whose complement modality does not imply the
realization of the complement situation. The irrealis modality can be either
PROSPECTIVE (i.e. the realization of the situation is expected for the future)
or POTENTIAL (i.e. the realization is not expected for a particular moment in
the future but is possible anytime).
The subject of the Infinitival complement clause is generally omitted
under referential identity with the subject of the main clause ( S U B J E C T35620. C o m p l e m e n t c l a u s e sCONTROL) or in one case {tun, the causative verb) with the Adelative object
of the main clause (OBJECT CONTROL). An exception are complements to the
one-place verb baSlamiSun 'begin' (20.2.5.), which have their own subject.
The following sections consist of lists of valence patterns with Infinitival
complements and illustrative examples that instantiate the various types.

Complement clausesThere are quite a few different morphosyntactic strategies for forming complement clauses, each of which is described in one of the sections of this
chapter. In principle, the complement-taking verb determines which complement-forming strategy is chosen, and the strategy has to be given in the
dictionary. However, the choice of complement-forming strategies is to a
large extent predictable from the meaning of the verb and the complement
clause. Roughly, the zero strategy (20.1.) is used for direct speech, the
Infinitive (20.2.) is used for irrealis complements, the Masdar (20.3.) is used
for complements with action meaning, the substantivized participle (20.4.)
is used for factive complements, the luhunCsay') strategy (20.5.) is used for
non-factive propositional-attitude verbs, the converb strategy (20.6.) is used
for verbs of perception, and the ii-strategy (20.7.) is used to extrapose complements of several different types.
The subject of complement clauses is often omitted under identity with
an argument of the main clause (i.e. it is controlled by one of the main
clause arguments). To facilitate the recognition of the control relations, each
of the relevant sections in this chapter contains at least one example where
the relations are made explicit notationally. The omitted target is represented by a 0 (zero), and both the target and its controller are underlined.
See also 22.3. for some discussion of control in complement clauses.
The use of the terms ""subject"" and ""object"" for controllers and targets in
this chapter is not unproblematic; see 16.1. for some discussion.","[373, 374]"

23.3.2. ""Indirect questions"" used as independent sentences
Sentences whose main verb is in the Conditional mood can also be used as
independent sentences and express hesitating questions, self-addressed questions (Ί wonder...'), and statements with low probability. They can perhaps
be regarded as ""indirect questions used as independent sentences"".
(However, such ""independent indirect questions"" of the alternative type differ from indirect alternative questions, where the Conditional mood is not
used, cf. 23.3.1.3. above.)

20.2.4. Object-controlled complements
The Infinitive subject is controlled by the main-clause Adelative argument
with the verb tun 'make, cause'. This verb is the standard way to express
causative situations. It is sometimes treated as a ""causative auxiliary"" (e.g.
Uslar 1896, Moor 1985), but there is no reason not to regard it as an ordinary
complement-taking verb.

"22.4. Reflexivization
The usual means for marking coreference within a clause are the reflexive
pronouns (11.2.): wit for 3rd person singular, 6eb for 3rd person plural, zuw
for 1st and 2nd person singular. As in the case of coreferential omission, the
precise syntactic conditions for the use of reflexive pronouns are not easy to
determine, and a lot depends on the pragmatics.
22.4.1. Syntactic function of the antecedent
The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun must occupy a prominent syntactic
position. For instance, it cannot be the direct object or a possessor when the
reflexive pronoun is the subject:

b. *Wiöi-zself-DATAli.di-nAli-GENruS-ardaughter-PL'Himself saw Ali's daughters.'aku-na.see-AOR22.4. Reflexivization409Most commonly, the antecedent is the subject and the reflexive pronoun is
a non-subject argument or a noun modifier. Example (1140) shows an
Absolutive subject antecedent, and (1141) shows Ergative subject antecedents.

experiencer or other roles that are typically filled by human referents.
(1146) a. Ada-ηrik'.e-lwiöi-nshe-GEN heart-SRESSstxa-jarself-GEN brother-PL return-IMPF'She remembers her brothers.'
b. Ferma.di-n rak'-ar-a

The antecedent may also be within the relative clause part of a cleft sentence
(cf. 19.4.):
(1147) Ada-zaku-r-diöpi-ndexme.di-n[he-DAT see-AOP-SBST] selves-GEN cabin-GENcl-arwaqawwall-PL androoftir. (X89:31)
COP:PSTWhat he saw were the walls and the roof of their poor cabin.'
And the antecedent may be the Genitive modifier of a noun phrase when
the reflexive pronoun occurs within the noun phrase, e.g.
(1148) Güldeste.di-n
Güldeste-GENwiöi-njuldaS.di-nt'warala-j[self-GENhusband-GENnamebe.on-PTP] grandchild'Giildeste's grandson who bears her husband's name'xtul (583:21)22.4. Reflexivization411However, it is not possible to put any syntactic limits on the positions that
the antecedent may occupy. While it is possible to maintain in most of the
cases above that the antecedent is a subject or a quasi-subject, this is completely impossible in the following cases.
(1149) a. ISttin äadwal
[suchpleasureöin-a-niface-INESS-alsowiH-Zi-niAu-n.i-kdiRahman.a-niSad qhwerhat-na. (J89:21)self-DAT-also become-MSD]-SBDIR Rahman-GENglad smileappear-AOR'Since such a pleasure had also happened to him, a happy smile

Daghestan.'
In both cases the controller is a Genitive NP used attributively within another NP and therefore a very unlikely syntactic (quasi-)subject. But note
that the head noun on which the controller NP depends refers to a mental
situation which is spelled out in the rest of the sentence. The controller NP
is therefore pragmatically very salient, so any generalization concerning
possible controllers of reflexivization in Lezgian must refer to pragmatic factors, or perhaps to the semantic factor 'human/non-human'.
Sometimes the antecedent of the reflexive pronoun is even in object position:
(1150) a. Tagi=xaluwiöi-nTagi=unclefikir-r.iself-GEN thought-PL(ERG)ak'ai-nawa-j.torment-PRF-PST(J89:32)'Uncle Tagi was tormented by his thoughts.'

This is only possible when the antecedent is animate and no other possible
antecedent exists in the clause.","[430, 431]"

21.6.4. Purpose clauses with luhuz/lahana + Optative
In this type of purpose clause, the verb is in the Optative form. The purpose
meaning arises in the following way: Ά does B, saying: May C do D!' gives
rise to 'A does Β in order for C to do D'. Such purpose clauses always have a
subject that is not identical to any of the arguments of the superordinate
clause. As in the case of luhuz/lahana
in causal clauses (cf. 21.5.3.), such
purpose clauses express a highly subjective motivation. A literal translation
with 'saying' is often not very far from the correct sense, cf. (1094).
(1094) Wunmasa-bur.u-lajusal ta-itu-j[you:ABS other-SBST.PL-SREL poorluhuz, zaNEG-be-OPT saying] I:ERGzehmet-arwunpatal6'ugwa-zwa. (N88:72)work-PLyou:ABSforpull-IMPFwiri

In the following example the subjective value of this type of purpose clause
is clearly shown by the different perspectives in the main clause (speaker's
perspective: the speaker recalls her childhood) and the subordinate clause39421. Adverbial clauses(the adults' perspective). Here the translation with 'so thaf is somewhat
misleading.

put-PRF-PSTThey had put us in the middle so that the children (i.e. we) would

In conditional sentences of the most common type, the protasis is marked
(a) by the Conditional mood suffix -t'a on the verb and optionally (b) by one
of the clause-introducing conjunctions eger and nagah 'if' (loans from
Persian). The use of eger is particularly frequent in styles that are strongly
influenced by Russian (e.g., journalistic writing).
The form of the verb to which the Conditional mood suffix is attached is
determined by the time reference of the clause and by the degree of hypotheticality. Two degrees of hypotheticality are distinguished: ordinary conditionals and counterfactual conditionals.
21.7.1. Ordinary conditionals
In the most common type of ordinary conditional, the time reference is in
the future. In such conditionals, the apodosis verb is in the Future, and the
protasis verb is in the Aorist participle form.

"61. Introduction

Dative subjects occur with some experiential verbs, e.g.
(3) Wax.a-zstxaaku-na.sister-DAT brother(ABS) see-AORT h e sister saw the brother.'
There is no agreement in Lezgian, neither in noun phrases nor on finite
verbs. Personal pronouns are normally used if there are no full noun
phrase arguments. (However, these may be omitted if they can be recovered
from the context.)
(4) Adaaburk'wal.i-zshe(ERG) they(ABS)raqur-na.house-DATsend-AOR'She sent them home.'
Lezgian has practically no rules that change grammatical relations. There
is only a derivational suffix -(a)r (causative) which turns intransitive verbs
into transitive verbs.
Subordinate clauses are normally non-finite, i.e. marked by special subordinating verb forms, and they generally precede the superordinate clause.
Relative clauses make use of the participles, which have no inherent orientation and can therefore be used to relativize almost any constituent.

Complement clauses are of three major types: Masdar (verbal noun)
complements (6), Infinitival complements (7), and participial complements
(8).","[25, 26]"
"22.2. Controller and target of omission in adverbial clauses
In the overwhelming majority of cases, the target of coreferential omission
is the subject, i.e. the Ergative, intransitive Absolutive, or Dative experiencer argument. This is illustrated in (1126-1135) below. In exceptional cases,
the transitive Absolutive argument (the direct object) may be omitted under
coreference, as in (1124). This seems to be possible only when the Ergative
argument is inanimate and therefore is not a typical subject.
(1124) Dilnja,

(Lit. '...flames having caught [it] from end to end...')
Non-subject targets of omission are also possible in converbal clauses with
one of the local copulas. Such clauses are usually very short and resemble
postpositions rather than adverbial clauses.
(1125) a. Amzakwe-ztargwa-zxta-j-laluhu-da.that:ABS I:ERG you.all-DAT [[tara be.at-IMC] retum-AOP-TEMP] say-FUTThat I'll tell you-all when [I] come back with a tara (lit. a tara being

songladbe-FUT-NEG'Which son is not glad when his father comes back with so much

Subjects are not only the most common targets of omission, they are also
the most common controllers. In (1126) an Ergative argument is the controller, in (1127) an Absolutive argument is the controller, and in (1128) a
Dative experiencer argument is the controller.

Like indirect questions and conditional clauses, correlative relative clauses
tend to precede all other words of the superordinate clause. But (as Gad2iev
1963:140 observes) even here clause-medial position is not excluded, e.g.
(955) Ktab za
bookwa-z,I:ERG you-DATwunmus ata-j-t'a,haö'aw.u-z[you:ABS when come-AOP-CND] t h a t time-DATgu-da.give-FUT'When you come, I will give you a book.' (G63:140)
When the interrogative word is the determiner hi 'which', the full NP may
be repeated in the main clause.
(956) Aburhi[theygaf.uni-zwhich word-DATk'anikajtaluq'ja-t'a,hagaf.uni-nbelonging COP-CND] t h a t word-GENc'ar 6'ug-u. (G57:43)belowlinedraw-IMPV'Whichever word they belong to, draw a line below that word.'
The non-specific character of such relative clauses may be emphasized by
putting har 'every7 (11.7.2.) in front of the interrogative word.
(957) Harhiuöenik[every which pupilönaiurnalwiri-da-lajall-SBST-SRELwilik ata-j-t'a,before come-AOP-CND]hada-zthat-DATgu-da. (G63:9)we:ERG magazine give-FUT'Whichever pupil comes first, to him we will give the magazine.'
Correlative relative clauses with the verb in the indicative (rather than in
the Conditional mood) are found in the archaic poetic language:
(958) Q'el hikas.dine-da,hadajadqhwa-da.[salt which man(ERG) eat-FUT] that(ERG) water drink-FUT'Whoever eats salt will drink water.' (Jetim Emin, G54:5)
This construction is more usual in the neighboring languages Budukh and
Kryz (Boguslavskaja 1981).
Non-specific relative clauses are similar in meaning to parametric concessive conditional clauses, and their formal expression differs only in that
parametric concessive conditionals have the additional suffix -ni (cf. 21.8.4.).",[366]
"20.6. The converb strategy
This strategy is used in two cases: (1) in different-subject complements to
k'an- 'want, must'; (2) in situation complements to akun 'see'.
20.6.1. Different-subject complements to k'anAs we saw in 20.2.1., same-subject (and subject-controlled) complements to
k'an- are expressed by the Infinitive. But when the complement subject is
not coreferential with the Dative subject of k'an-, the complement is expressed by the Aorist converb. A minimal pair is shown in (1029a-b).
(1029) a. Nabisat.a-zktabNabisat-DAT[bookk'el-izk'an-zawa.read-INF]want-IMPF'Nabisat wants to read a book.'
b. Nabisat.a-zNabisat-DATruS.a[girl(ERC)ktab k'el-na
bookread-AOC]k'an-zawa.want-IMPFTMabisat wants her daughter to read a book.'
See 16.1.3. for more discussion of the two types of k'an- complements (and
cf. (190b) for an unusual Masdar complement of k'an-).
When k'an- is used without a subject ('one wants'), it means 'must'.
Since the complement subject is necessarily different from the (non-existing) subject of k'an-, the complement predicate is always in the Aorist converb form. In this meaning, k'an- is generally in the Future tense (k'anda,
cf. 9.5.2.1.).
(1030) Nabisat.a[Nabisat(ERG)ktabbookk'el-naread-AOC]k'an-da.want-FUT'Nabisat has to read a book.' (lit. 'One wants Nabisat to read a book.')37020. Complement clauses20.6.2. Situation complements to akutt 'see'
All the three general converbs (Aorist converb, Imperfective converb and
Secondary Imperfective converb of the Perfect) are used in complement
clauses with situation meaning to akun 'see'. See 20.4. for fact complements
of akun.

Complement clauses can be extraposed to a clause-final position. In such
cases the particle Ai follows the complement-taking predicate, and an intonation break (indicated by a comma) separates the main clause from the extraposed complement clause that follows it. This strategy was borrowed ultimately from Persian (probably via Turkic), where ke is a clause-initial subordinator. However, in Lezgian xi is clearly a clause-final particle (as it is in
some
(1034) Turkic
Selim.a languages).
laha-na £i Nabisat
Seher.di-z
fe-na.
Selim(ERG)say-AORΡΓNabisattown-DATgo-AOR'Selim said that Nabisat had gone to town.'
The status of the extraposed complement clause seems to be ambiguous between subordinate clause status and independent clause status. Evidence for
this ambiguity comes from reflexive pronouns, which have to be used in
subordinate clauses when coreference with a reflexive controller in the superordinate clause is intended (see 22.4.). In extraposed clauses either the reflexive or the anaphoric pronouns may be used:20.7. The xi strategy 371

The extraposition strategy can be used, roughly, whenever English that is
used, i.e. in complements to (1) cognitive complement-taking predicates; (2)
verbs of thinking; (3) verbs of saying; (4) evaluative predicates.
20.7.1. Cognitive complement-taking predicates

"15.4. Non-standard valence patterns
15.4.1. Valence patterns with a Dative subject argument:
the Affective Construction.
When Dative arguments represent experiencer participants, they play a
privileged role and the case can be made that they are subjects (cf. 16.1.). The
construction with a Dative subject is called the Affective Construction in
Daghestanian linguistics (cf. Alekseev 1975, Sejxov 1986). The special status
of the Dative argument is one of the reasons why valence patterns with
Dative experiencers are given special treatment here. The valence pattern in
(742) is formally identical to the valence pattern in 15.3.2.1., but the two arguments correspond to different semantic roles and show different syntactic
behavior.
