GRAMMARUnlike so many Papuan languages in Papua New Guinea, Yele does not have a switch
reference system. Verbs move in a bewildering array of modes and tenses, doubled by an all­
pervasive distinction in duration, and elaborated by the incorporation of deictics into the
verb. Analysis proves difficult, because many of these distinctions are expressed in
portmanteau morphemes, rather than by agglutination. Yele also shows the
monofocallpolyfocal distinction found in some New Guinea Highland languages.
The order of terms in the clause is SOV. Within the predicate, a modified norninative­
accusative system operates, but the items predicated in the clause follow ergative marking.
The ergative marker used with singular Agents, nge, is homophonous with the Instrument
marker, as in a number of Huon Peninsula languages.
2.1 PREDICAnONYele verbs move through a multidimensional array of:
indicative, imperative and habitual moods, doubled by
continuous and punctiliar aspect, and multiplied by
six tenses:
future, immediate future, present,
immediate past, near past and remote past.
The verbs also agree with the person and number of the subject and object. The
morphemes marking all these parameters are merged into portmanteau forms which defy
simple analysis, and contribute to the reputation Yele has of being impossible to learn,
whether by Papua New Guinean or by foreigner.
The morphemes appended to the verb root - prefixes and suffixes in many languages are in Yele separated from the verb root on phonological grounds. Thus a predicate consists
of a prenuclear component, verb root and postnuclear component, each written as a separate
word. Many verb roots vary in form to express the mood, aspect and tense by using
suppletive forms or reduplication. (Some irregular verbs have as many as five different
roots. See §2.1.4 for the details.)
The verbal prenucleus also expresses the mood, aspect and tense, along with the person
and number of the subject of the predication. (I am using the term 'aspect' in the 'catch-all'
sense, so 'aspect' in this chapter includes more than duration. It also includes the items
elaborated in §2.1.7, such as indefiniteness, commonality and repetition.) It is in the
prenucleus that a number of deictics can be incorporated. (See §2.l.S and §2.1.7).
With transitive verbs the postnucleus expresses the person and number of the object, but
also reflects the mood, aspect and tense, and often monitors the person and number of the
subject as well. (See §2.1.6).
1415
With intransitive verbs, the postnucleus expresses the duration, mood and tense of the
verb, and then the number of the subject. In imperatives, the postnucleus also monitors the
person of the subject. (See Tables 2. 1. 6.1 and 2. 1. 6. 2.)
The following examples illustrate the Ergative-Absolutive system operating in the clause.
The Ergative referent is marked with <ngb, while the Absolutive referent is unmarked.

This section deals with the order of items in clauses manifesting verbal predications.
§2. 1 .9 deals with non-verbal predications.
( 1 ) Presence of explicit subjects and objects
Since the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the Yele verb mark the subject and
object of the predication so fully, these referents are frequently not specified by nouns or
noun phrases. Typically, they are made explicit where they enter a discourse, or where the
referents change, and elsewhere are carried just by the markers in the verb. For example, text
(a) in §2.4 introduces the author in the verbal prenucleus of clause 1 , and thereafter his
identity is carried by the verbal markers. He introduces his brother Nkal by name in clause
6a, and the quote formulae in their conversation keep track of the speakers. Nkal refers to
fish with a noun in 6c. Third person objects are introduced with nouns in clause l Ob 'I didn't
see anyone' and 1 1 b 'I chewed some betel nut' . The author refers to his father with a kin58
term in 1 2c, and quotes h i s father' s use o f h i s own name in 1 3b. H i s father also mentions
fish with a noun, in 1 5b.
Where there is more than one third person referent on stage at a time in a discourse, the
subjects and objects are made explicit more often, to ensure that the hearer can keep track of
the referents of the clauses. (As is often the case, folk stories show less explicit reference to
the participants, because everyone knows who does what in the story, and it is not necessary
to be as explicit. Everyone knows, that is, except the linguist from another culture!). Text (d)
in §2.4 provides an example of a text with more than one third person referent on stage at a
time. It is by the same author as the fishing story referred to above. The topic of the text is a
savage dog, which is introduced and named in clause l a, then referred to with third person
singular verb parts in clause 1 b. The author disclaims responsibility in sentence 2 ,
introducing himself with a pronoun, and using the word 'dog' in sentence 3 . H e names the
culprit, his brother Nkal, with a noun, and uses the word 'dog' again in sentence 4. Nkal ' s
name is repeated i n sentence 5, but this time the other third person referent i s understood to
be the dog, without specific reference. The dog is mentioned again specifically in the next
sentence, number 6. It remains the topic of the rest of that paragraph, sentences 7 to 9, being
referred to only pronominally. Sentence 1 0 begins a narrative episode, in which Mepe and
his son Yidika are introduced by name. In this episode each sentence uses a noun to refer to
one of these actors, as the initiative moves from one third person referent to another in quick
succession. The result of the incident comes in sentence 1 7, but the dog is not mentioned
specifically - it is just the third person singular referent of the verb. The text ends with a
specific reference to a safe road for people to follow.
(2) Order of items in the clause
Apart from the subject and object of the clause, other items can be included at will when
their semantic content is to be made explicit, up to a limit of five items in any one clause,
including the predicate. The histogram in Table 2. 1 .8 . 1 shows the proportion of transitive
and intransitive clauses having each number of items. The histogram is based on a sample of
667 clauses all from texts or conversation.","[65, 66]"

With first and second person objects, the similarity with the free pronouns (Table 2. 1 .5. 1 )
can easily be seen. With the third person objects, dual and plural are nearly always marked
with forms containing d and t respectively.
( 1 ) Monofocal versus polyfocal subject
Many of the forms show a consistent pattern where for any number of object, one form is
used if the subject is first person or singular, and a different form is used with other subjects.
The forms used with a third person object and indicative proximal events or with punctiliar
habituals provide an example of this phenomenon. If the subject is first person or singular,
the postnucleus is @ for a singular object, de for a dual object or te for a plural obj ect. For
subjects other than first person or singular, however, the corresponding forms are ngme,
d:oo and t:oo respectively. Deibler ( 1 964:23) and Young ( 1 964:47-49 and 1 97 1 :22-23) have
termed these monofocal and polyfocal forms in describing Gahuku and B ena-bena
respectively, Papuan languages of the New Guinea Highlands. Table 2 . 1 .6.3 highlights this
phenomenon, showing how a third person plural object is affected by the person and number
,
of the subject in 'X ate them (yesterday) .

tumoThe postnucleus nge/@ used with monofocal subjects is analogous to the wo/@ postnuclei
of remote past indicative intransitive verbs with a singular subject. Weak transitive verbs
with a third person singular object and a monofocal subject have a postnucleus of nge,
whereas strong transitive verbs change to the remote past verb root with zero postnucleus.
(See examples (56) and (57) in §2. 1 .4.)40
Haiman ( 1 979:898) has subjected Young ' s analysis to resegmentation to highlight firstly
the occurrence of a glottal stop in dual modal suffixes and secondly the identical marking of
first person plural and second person singular. He points out that these two features are
typical of a number of languages of the Eastern New Guinea Highlands Stock. It is
interesting to note the identity of second and third person dual prenuclei in Yele in continuous
non-proximal tenses (Table 2. 1 .5.3) and with punctiliar habitual forms (Table 2. 1 .5 .2). This
identity does not extend to the first person dual forms, however. Another point to note is that
where languages of the Eastern New Guinea Highlands Stock have the same modal suffix
for second person singular and first person plural, Yele has the same prenuclear component
for second person singular and first person dual in continuous habituals, immediate past and
immediate future indicatives (Table 2. 1 .5.3) and in punctiliar indicatives other than those in
the immediate past tense (Table 2. 1 .5.2).
(2) Natural topic hierarchy
The effect of the natural topic hierarchy (see Dixon 1 976:7f, 1 1 2-200) can be seen in
Table 2. 1 .6.2, in that first and second person objects are important enough for the free
pronouns to have a strong influence on the predicate postnuclei used with these objects. With
third person objects, however, the person and number of the subject are increasingly
important, until the point is reached in the last three lines of Table 2 . 1 .6.2, where for third
person singular objects of punctiliar imperatives, the person and number of the subject are
almost completely distinguished.","[46, 47, 48]"

There is a set of intransitive verbs which take as Goal objects that are affected by the
action of the verb. These objects at first seem to be the objects of transitive verbs, but the use
of ka to mark them and the verb morphology show that Yele regards them as the Goals of
intransitive verbs instead.

"With transitive verbs in the remote past tense where the object is third person singular and
the subject is monofocal (i.e. first person or singular), strong verbs use the strong root with

section deals with the system of cases marked in the clause, and with the structure of

2.2. 1 CA SE RELATIONSHIPS
( 1 ) Ergative and Absolutive
The Ergative-Absolutive system operating within the clause has been introduced in §2. 1

verb has been described in §2. 1 .5 and §2. 1 .6. This agreement is illustrated again briefly in
examples ( 1 46) and ( 1 50).
With transitive verb roots the verbal prenucleus agrees in person and number with the
Ergative item, the subject of the clause. (See the tables in §2. 1 .5 . ) The postnucleus agrees
primarily with the Absolutive item, the object of the clause, but it also monitors the subject to
some degree. (See the tables in §2. 1 .6.) Examples ( 1 46a) to ( 1 46e) illustrate this agreement.

012.1. 4 THE PREDICATE NUCLEUS
The predicate nucleus consists of the verb root and sometimes an incorporated noun.
( 1 ) Noun incorporationNoun incorporation is a flexible and ongoing process in Yele, and is used to refer to an
action affecting a generic noun in the role of Patient or Goal. The noun incorporated must be
non- specific, and the resulting predicate is intransitive and continuous. As Mithun
(1984: 849) has pointed out, the noun cannot co-occur with deictics or numerals. Noun
incorporation in Yele matches her type 1.1 classification, composition by juxtaposition:
... a V and its direct object are simply juxtaposed to form an especially tight
bond. The V and N remain separate words phonologically; but as in all
compounding, the N loses its syntactic status as an argument of the sentence,
and the VN unit functions as an intransitive predicate.
Example (39a) is typical of noun incorporation, while (39b) shows how the noun cannot
be incorporated if specified in some way, in this instance by a possessive pronoun.

Stress is predictable, falling first on two-syllable words, and first and third on four­
syllable words. In four-syllable words, the first syllable is stressed slightly more than the
third syllable.

crocodileReduplicated words longer than two syllables are phonologically two words, because
voiceless allophones are found at the beginning of the reduplication, as are found word­
initially. (See Table 1.1.15.) Although the longer reduplicated words are phonologically
separate words, they function grammatically as single words, so they are written as single
words in the practical orthography.

inhabitants of Rossel Island in the Milne B ay Province of Papua New Guinea. It is non­
Austronesian, sharing only 6 per cent of cognates with the nearest Austronesian language,
Sudest. (See Henderson and Henderson 1 974.) No close relatives of Yele have been
identified.
This monograph describes the phonology and grammar of the language, highlighting the
portmanteau orthography and portmanteau interaction of tense, mood and aspect i n
predications. The grammatical description is b y prose statements, the analytical insights
being drawn mainly from Tagmemics and Functional Grammar (Dik 1 978).
A preliminary description of the Yele language was published in 1 975 ( Henderson 1 975).
I wish to express my gratitude t9 the people of the Jinjo area of Rossel Island, particularly
to Gregory Mepe, John Lamonga and Isidore Yidika, for their patience in teaching my wife
and me their language, and in explaining the significance of the features of Yele grammar. I
also wish to thank fellow members of the Summer Institute of Linguistics whose guidance
made this analysis possible, particularly Joy Lloyd, Anna Kila, Robert Litteral, Ger Reesink
and Carl Whitehead. I am also grateful to Professor Talmy Giv6n for his suggestions,
derived from his broad experience.vABBREVIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS[item] A

"(8) Interaction between duration and transitivity
While transitive verbs are generally distinct from intransitive verbs, and both can be either
continuous or punctiliar, there is a small set of verbs in which there is an interaction between
transitivity and duration. The verb 'writelcarve' is a suitable example of the verbs in this set.
The transitive verb d:ee 'write something' is completely regular, using the root d:ee for all
punctiliar predications (58 a), and the reduplicated form d:eed:ee for all continuous
predications (58b). The intransitive verb 'writing ' , however, is also d:ee, but in this case the
root is continuous (58c). As is to be expected, the intransitive form shows focus on the
event, with no way of specifying the object being carved or written. There is no punctiliar
intransitive verb 'write' .",[39]

to the speech act: present, immediate future and immediate past. Similarly , with punctiliar
aspect, postnuclear dmi is used with the three tenses closest to the speech act: future,
immediate past and near past. This pattern is also evident with transitive predicate postnuclei,
so for each duration the three tenses closest to the speech act are termed 'proximal'. Remote
past differs clearly from the proximal tenses, not only in peripheral components of the
predicate, but also in verb root selection, as shown in sections 2. 1. 4 to 2.1. 6 below. The24remaining two tenses used with continuous aspect (future and near past) are termed 'distal'.
Their peripheral predicate components are identical except that the future is marked with a­
'future' to distinguish it from near past. Table 2. 1.3.2 represents this division of tenses
diagrammatically.

(7) Transitive verb tense marking
Turning now to the equivalent transitive verb 'hide something', the punctiliar root is
ngmo, while ngm:aa is used with continuous aspect. The transitive forms use the same
prenuclei as the intransitive predicates do, but the postnuclei are different. While intransitive
postnuclei divide first by duration then by mood and tense and finally by the number of the
subject (see Table 2. 1.6.1), transitive postnuclei divide first on the person of the object, then
on duration, mood and tense and finally on the number of the object and the person and
number of the subject. (See Table 2. 1.6.2.) The postnuclei are discussed in detail in §2.1.6.
Table 2.1.3.3 gives the transitive equivalents of the forms in Table 2.1.3. 1, for instances
with third person plural subject and third person singular object (such as 'They will be hiding
it').

(8) Tenses in imperative mood
In the imperative mood, punctiliar verbs display two tenses, an imperative to be obeyed
immediately and a deferred imperative, which is not to be obeyed until a later time.
Continuous imperatives, however, show no distinctions in tense. Imperatives with second or
third person subjects have a prenucleus of dpi if the action is not to be performed
immediately, compared with zero prenucleus when the action is to be performed straight
away.

2. 23Combined with the 38 contrastively different vowel sounds outlined above, this gives a
grand total of 94 contrastively different sounds in the language.
Traditional phonemic principles call for the interpretation of 'ambivalent' sequences of
consonants, to decide whether they should be regarded as consonant clusters or complex
consonants. Normally one would look for clusters of heterorganic consonants on which to
base a cluster solution when interpreting prenasalised stops, stops with nasal release,
palatalisation and labialisation, but there are no sequences of consonants that do not involve
one or more of these features. Simultaneous bilabial closure involves two articulations, but
they occur simultaneously, and act as a multiplier, covering the prenasalisation or nasal
release of a stop as well as the stop itself. Clearly the 'unambivalent cluster' criterion must be
relaxed, or the sum total of consonant phonemes could approach the possible maximim of
56!
The sequences [pY], [kY] and [mY] cited in Tables 1. 2. 6 and 1.2.7 above are heterorganic,
even though they involve palatalisation. They provide the basis for recognising consonant semivowel clusters. [Y] and [W] can then be regarded as allophones of y and w respectively.
Turning now to prenasalisation and nasal release, it is observed that they constitute a reverse
sequence, stop-nasal and nasal-stop, so those clusters are allowed on that basis.
Following traditional phonemic principles, the consonants with simultaneous bilabial
closure would be set apart as separate phonemes, addingtprimdpnmkpngmand Iv12
to the thirteen basic phonemes illustrated in Table 1.2.1, making a total of 20 basic
consonantal phonemes.
In this analysis a consonant would have the formula C1(C2)S, where if Cl and C2 are
both manifested, they are homorganic in the order nasal-stop or stop-nasal. The order stop­
nasal only occurs with post-alveolar and velar consonants. With bilabial consonants, S can
be manifested by yand w simultaneously.
Non-nasal continuants are a special case, with the formula C(y), where yoccurs only with
1 and v.
1. 3 SECONDARY PHONEMES
The founder of prosodic analysis, J.R. Firth (1948:4), rejected the ""tendency to use one
magic phoneme principle within a monosystemic hypothesis"" and applied the term 'prosody'
to a feature extending over more than one segment, such as the voicelessness of the [st]
sequence in English. Grimes (1969: 85-88) outlines the principle of regarding as a
simultaneous prosody any features which pertain to a larger unit than a single segment. In the
transformational mould, Goldsmith (1979) has proposed autosegmental phonology, in
which phonological entities are effective in separate tiers. For example, tones would be in a
separate tier from that covering the consonantal and vocalic segments of utterances. Other
scholars have applied autosegmental phonology to further phenomena, such as complex
segments, vowel harmony and nasalisation, as reported by Van der Hulst and Smith (1982).
I have followed these departures from monosystemic analysis and set up a distinction
between basic phonemes and secondary phonemes. My secondary phonemes are contrastive
modifications which can be handled most economically in a second system, and which can
extend over more than one segmental phoneme. They are analogous to the suprasegmentals
of traditional Phonemics, to Firth's and Grimes' prosodies and to the tiers of autosegmental
phonology. I use the term 'secondary phoneme' rather than 'prosody' as the latter term is the
equivalent in Generative Phonology of the traditional term 'suprasegmentals' (Schane
1973:14). Granting a second system of phonemes opens the door for a simpler and more
concise analysis, and leads naturally to an economical and effective arrangement of the
material to be covered in the primer with which speakers of Yele can learn to read their own
language (Henderson and Henderson 1978). The more basic phonemes are introduced first,
and then the secondary phonemes quickly expand the readers' capabilities.
Turning now to the secondary phonemes of the Yele language, the eleven basic vowel
phonemes displayed in Table 1.1.1 are augmented by two secondary phonemes, length and
nasalisation. Length is readily accepted as a suprasegmental phoneme along with pitch and
stress in traditional Phonemics. Schane (1973: 14f) lists these three as prosodies. Pike
(1947: 63) regards only these three as suprasegmentals under the premise that only
""quantitative characteristics ... may serve as suprasegmental phonemes"". He also refers in a
bibliographical section to the work of many linguists, from those who regard various other
features as suprasegmentals to those who deny any structurally relevant distinction between
segmental and suprasegmental phonemes (Pike 1960/3:53). Thus length would be regarded
by most linguists as a suprasegmental or as a prosody, so I automatically count it with the
secondary phonemes in Yele. I also regard nasalisation as a secondary phoneme, as it can be
applied to eight of the basic vowel phonemes, and it constitutes alone a causative morpheme:
[ta y�i]
[ta y�]it fell down
he made it fall13
[ta pWi:]
[ta pWJ::]it came out
he made it come outThe secondary phoneme of nasalisation removes the need for a series of eight nasalised
vowels, and nasalisation is taught successfully in a single lesson in the Yele primer
(Henderson and Henderson 1 978: 22- 26).
If simultaneous bilabial closure can be regarded as a secondary phoneme of consonants
analogous to length and nasalisation of vowels, then the seven simultaneous stops and
continuants demonstrated in Table 1. 2. 4 can be represented as the corresponding non-bilabial
consonants uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure. When prenasalised stops or those with
nasal release are uttered with sirniltaneous bilabial closure, the bilabial closure affects both
the stop and the nasal, as illustrated in Table 1. 2.5.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"
"There is a small set of verbs of motion in which the punctiliar root is used to portray an
event actually taking place at the moment of speech, or an event soon to take place. The fact
that a punctiliar root is used in the domain of the continuous is marked by an anomalous set

equivalent. The following examples illustrate the fact that kee, 166 and pwiye are essentially

"(7) 'Weak' versus 'Strong' verbs
Another dichotomy affecting punctiliar verb root selection is between 'weak' and ' strong'
verbs. The dichotomy is only relevant in the remote past tense. With remote past intransitive
verbs with singular subject, strong verbs change to the strong root with zero postnucleus
(54c), but weak verbs use the normal punctiliar root or the ' followed root' as appropriate
(see 'Paranoid' verbs above) with a postnucleus of wo (55c):

"The continuous root of a verb is also used as a nominal item, to name the event. When
used this way, the object affected by the event can be made explicit, but the Agent of the
action cannot be specified. Examples (11) and (12) below illustrate the verb 'hit', whose
punctiliar root is vy:a and whose continuous root is vyee. In example (12), vyee is used as a
nominal item. (Examples (11) and (12) can be seen in their wider context in text (a) in §2. 4,
where they are sentences 9 and l Oa respectively.)

With intransitive verb roots the verbal prenucleus agrees in person and number with the
subject of the clause. The postnucleus also agrees with the subject, but only in number.

doer of somethingWhen interpreting sequences of vowels such as [k!e] 'bite', there are no sequences of low
vowels such as * [£0] on which to base an interpretation as a sequence of two vowel
phonemes. All vowel sequences involve a high or mid close vowel, suggesting that
palatalisation, labialisation or a semivowel is involved. Palatalisation and labialisation both
contrast with sequences of a higher vowel followed by a lower vowel, as shown in Table
1.1.13.

semivowel-vowel, to avoid a sequence of vowels. Thus two items of Table 1.1.13 are
interpreted as follows:
[pie]
[pgo]is interpreted as

PUW8lean against
started itBy analogy, sequences of [i] followed by a lower vowel are interpreted as having [y]
between the [i] and the lower vowel:
[k!a]
[k!:G]is interpreted as
is interpreted askigha ripe
kight grandfatherThis interpretation is supported by dialect variation. The eastern dialect word [k!e] kighe
'lizard type' corresponds in the western dialect with [ki�e] kike. Further evidence for the
interpretation was found by dictation testing. I asked the test subjects to dictate test words
slowly so I could write them, breaking the words into syllables. Words such as [k!e] 'bite'5were dictated as [lei - j£] rather than as [ki - £] or [k!£]. Furthermore, people who had
been taught to write [i] as f and [y] as gh wrote words such as [lc!a] 'ripe' as kigha, thus
filling the gap in the distribution of [i] and [y], in that [y] never follows [i] in speech.
The remaining vowel sequences are �i], �i], �i] and @i]. These are interpreted as oy, ey,
ey and ay respectively. For example, [y�i] 'fall' is interpreted as ghay. Table 1.1.14 showsthese sequences in contrast with plain vowels.","[11, 12, 13]"
"IT. P- >C.SG.SB2. 1. 2 MOOD
I am using the term ' mood' to refer to a fuzzy parameter along which Yele makes three
structural distinctions, based on the type of speech act and the specificity of the action. These
distinctions are marked in the verbal prenucIeus and postnucIeus, and even affect the verb
root with some verbs. From the perspective of speech act, Yele makes only one major
distinction, namely that between informational speech and commands. Questions use the
same verb roots and exactly the same prenucIear and postnuclear components as do19
statements. Imperatives differ markedly in form from statements and questions. (Yes-no
questions differ from statements in intonation, and content questions contain a question
word. Otherwise they are the same as statements.) Thus Yele distinguishes morphologically
between informational speech and imperatival speech.
Within informational speech, Yele distinguishes between reference to specific events in
the past, present or future, as opposed to habitual events that people perform. The reference
to specific events is termed the indicative mood in this paper, while the reference to habitual
events is the habitual mood. Table 2. 1.2. 1 shows these distinctions diagrammatically.
TABLE 2. 1. 2. 1: PARAMETERS ALONG WHICH YELE MOODS ARE DISTINGUISHEDSpecific
InformationalIndicative moodSpecificity
HabitualHabitual moodSpeech act
CommandImperatival moodThe term 'imperative' is used for first person and third person forms as well as for second
person forms, as imperatival forms with all three persons of subject share two features in
common:
1 . All imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a tense distinction between
commands or suggestions to be carried out immediately and those to be deferred
until a later time. (See §2. 1. 3 below.)
2. All immediate imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a zero prenucleus. (See
Table 2. 1.5. 2 below.)
The morphological differences between the moods are difficult to characterise, because of
the portmanteau representation of a number of parameters at once. The following examples
illustrate the differences. The details are presented in §2. 1A and §2. 1.5 below.
Continuous intransitive:

"(2) Uniform verbs
As mentioned at the beginning of §2. 1 , many verbs express the mood, aspect and tense
by using suppletive forms, but there is a small set of verbs, referred to as ' uniform verbs' ,
which use the same root for all combinations of mood, aspect and tense. A n example is
mbepe 'run away / running' .

The morpheme takes a number of forms, depending on the combination of tense and
mood, and the person and number of the subject. These forms are displayed in Tables A-5
and A-6 in the appendix.
The simplest strategy used to indicate that motion is involved in the event is simply to
suffix -n:aa to the predicate prenucleus. This strategy is used with the following categories of
events:
A:punctiliar habitual or indicative immediate past with non third person Subject
(compare (8 I a) and (8 I b))B: punctiliar deferred imperative with fIrst person Subject (82)
C: continuous indicative and habitual in non-proximal tense (83)
D: continuous imperatives with non first person Subject (84)
