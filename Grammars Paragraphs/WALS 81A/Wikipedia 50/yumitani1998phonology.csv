"2.5.18.2. Lexical and postlexical modulesIn Lexical Phonology, some phonological rules apply only in the lexical
module, some only in the postlexical module, and some in both. The main difference
between the two modules is that the lexical module creates words as the output, so
sometimes a rule may require morphological information to derive the correct lexical
representation. In the postlexical module, however, supposedly there is no
morphological information to determine if a rule can apply. The postlexical module
consists of two submodules-asyntactic module and a phonetic implementaionmodule. The phonetic implementation includes, among other things, what are called
'allophonic rules' in classical phonemics.
The lexical module in Jemez seems to consist of three levels. Level 1 (simplestem formation) is necessary because some phonological rules must apply within a stem
first before the stem is compounded or affixed. Compounding and incorporation are
placed in Level 2 since a set of rules including tone rules only applies to compounds.
Finally, Level 3 (affixation) consists primarily of rules which operate on affixed stems.
Morphological processes do not have to be ordered at the same level, but phonological
rules must be ordered. In the model provided below, phonological rules in (a) must
apply before those in (b), and (b) before (c), etc. Within each group, the rules can
apply in any order. Note that L-effect operates at both Level 2 and LeveI 3. Also, e
Raising, Syllable-final Consonant Drop, F to M, and M to L, which are marked with an
asterisk *, apply both lexically and post-lexically.",[104]

"(76)'I am tired.' (in&[l sg]-be.tired/stat)i-kh&n€This speaker uses the forms with the palatalized stop, [kw6.1ami]and [khy&ni]
after
prefixes which do not contain [g (e.g. [Q-] 'intransitive prefix for second person
singular subject'), or when the prefix is null, as with third person singular subject.
This is in agreement with the above-mentioned distribution of velar stops, i.e. the
occurrence of palatalized and non-palatalized velar stops is phonetically conditioned:
the non-palatalized stops occur after non-low back vowels, and the palatalized stops
occur after other vowels.

The rule of Velar Stop Depalatalization which applies to velar stops after a
benefactive prefix can be formulated as (79).

environment in which a non-low back vowel such as /i/ and /o/ occurs before a velar
stop, whether or not a benefactive prefix is present. Such a generalized rule can be
formulated as (go), and it produces surface forms such as those in (81).

involves L-effect could be the result of a different order in rule application. The verb
stem-initial velar stop becomes depalatalized if the Velar Stop Depalatalization rule
applies before noun incorporation in a possessive construction, as in (82a). On theother hand, if noun incorporation takes place fust, then the Depalatalization rule may
only apply to the initial consonant of the incorporated noun, in which case, the velar
stop may remain palatalized. (See (82b) below.) This suggests that as in the case of Leffect, these phonological and morphological rules may apply at different levels in word
formation.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"

As we have seen, the application of some phonological rules requires
morphological information. In turn, some phonological rules must apply before certain
morphological processes in order to generate the correct output. Thus there is an
interaction between phonological rules and morphological processes, and the theory ofLexical Phonology seems to explain the Jemez data well. In this section, we will
briefly survey the domains in which phonological rules apply.
In the formation of simple stems (i.e. non-compounds), the rules in (1 1 1)
apply. Reduplication is used in deriving the imperfective form of some verbs. It must
apply before any other rule (e.g. L-effect) changes the shape of the verb root. The
imperfective form of some other verbs involve the change of root-final consonants.
The application of the Nasality Spread and Oral to Nasal Stop rules are limited to within
the stem.","[101, 102]"
"1.3. Previous research on the language and people of Jemez
1.3.1. Linguistic studies
There are not many published works on the Jemez language, and most of these
deal with comparison of Kiowa-Tanoan languages. Harrington (19 lob) was the first
linguist to include Jernez data. He compared the newly obtained Kiowa vocabulary
with similar words from Tiwa, Tewa, and Jemez. He did not provide any phonetic
guide to the triu~scription,and although some Jemez words cited there have accent
marks, the meanings of the marks are not clear.",[19]
"3.4.4.3. Class IIT nouns
The basic number for nouns in this class is singular and plural, so the inverse isonly dual. There is some overlap in categories of nouns, as reckoned in English terms,
between Classes II and III, but Class HI includes many terms for clothing, ornaments,
and modem objects. (Note that Jemez people use English words for items such as
television and radio.) It is also interesting that the word for 'sun' is a Class III noun,
but the word for 'moon' is Class I.

Contrary to the usual patterns in languages where 'give' is ditransitive, /m&/ is a simple

and transitivity and which occur with pronominal prefixes. In addition to words which
denote actions and processes, most of the words which would be treated as 'adjectives'
in other languages belong to this class. (See Section 3.8 'Noun qualifiers'.)
There are two classes of verbs: transitive and intransitive. Transitive verbs are
obligatorily detransitivized (i.e. passivized) under certain syntactic conditions, and this
is reflected in the inflectional paradigm and the pronominal prefixes which they take. It
is also possible to classify verbs as active or stative. All active verbs have at least five
inflected forms, while most stative verbs have just one basic form.
Jemez verbs are quite complex phonologically. Some consonants alternate, and
tones and vowel length vary with particular inflectional categories. For this reason,.there is a greater coverage of phonological phenomena in this chapter than in the
preceding chapter on noun morphology. The discussion of verbs in this chapter centers
around three main topics: (a) stem formation (Section 4.1 through 4.4), (b) pronominal
prefixes (Section 4.6), and (c) inflection (Section 4.8).
Unless stated otherwise, the citation forms of verbs found in the text (and many
examples) of this chapter are the perfective form for active verbs and the basic form for
stative verbs. This is necessitated by the fact that the surface forms of Jemez verbs can
be very different from the underlying forms due to various phonological processes.","[162, 163]"

45Note that In/ in /khy&ng'dog' is not glottalized when the word is incorporated in the
verb. The underlyingly F tone in the second syllable of the word is lowered to L
through the F to M and M to L rules (Section 2.4.3), and the Glottalization rule does
not apply to the 1111. Thus the surface form of the word for 'dog', when incorporated,
is homophonous to [khy$ni]'betired'.",[82]
"CHAPTER 2. PHONOLOGY2.0. Introduction
This chapter discusses the sound system of Jemez, including consonants and
vowels, phonotactics, suprascgmentals, and phonological rules. The language has a
complex phonology, and one of its most prominent features is the alternation of various
consonants. Some of the consonants have a limited distribution and are derived from
underlying segments. This is the rationale for setting up surface and underlying
consonants.
Martin (1964) contains a detailed description of Jemez sounds. She uses a nonabstract, classical phonemic approach in her analysis. She does not explain the
underlying systematic alternations among segments, some of which are phonologically
conditioned, others of which are morphologically conditioned. Her discussion of
syllables and tones is also brief, and there is a need for a more detailed account of them.
A more abstract, generativist approach is used in this analysis and description of
Jemez phonology in order to explain the underlying regularities. This dissertation
employs some notions and formal notations of generative phonology, particularly a
version of Lexical Phonology. However, I have tried to include a detailed account of
the facts since the data presented here should be accessible to linguists of various
theoretical orientations. I have also tried to keep the usage of formalism to a minimum
for the same reason.
Two terms and notations require clarification. I use the term 'underlying'
representation in the same sense as generative phonologists do, and I indicate the
underlying form by enclosing it between slashes / 1. This level is necessary for
capturing morphophonological alternations, which are very common in Jemez.
However, my 'surface' representation (or 'surface' forms), enclosed in square brackets[ 1, is not the same as 'surface' (or 'systematic phonetic') representation, as was usedin early generative phonology.' It is an abstraction from the systematic phonetic
representation; that is, not all the phonetic details are represented. Some sounds have
'allophonic' variants: for example, [th]is sometimes pronounced as [ts]in Jemez.
(Note that I use square brackets for both the basic and the variant phones? The
phonetic symbol for the more common variant is used to refer to the particular 'surface'
segment, i.e. [th]in this case.) I have included a discussion of some speech variation,
but a detailed analysis of stylistic and other types of variation is beyond the scope of
this study.
This surface level of representation is useful for practical reasons, too, that is,
for developing an orthography for the language. It is against the speakers' intuition to
insist that the letter 'byshould be used instead of 'm' in writing a word because the
former is the underlying form of (some occurrences of) the latter.
The surface segments were identified primarily on the basis of whether they
contrast on the lexical level, usually by identifying minimal or near-minimal pairs.","[24, 25, 26]"

'small' (Booker 1982). For a comparative Kiowa-Tanoanit is particularlystriking that in both Jemez and Kiowa, the same forms are used for the verbs 'be
sitting/stat' and 'by lying down/stat' when the subject is plural.54.2. Derivation
4.2. l. Detransitive verbsJemez has a detransitivizing suffix l-tz/ (perfective), which is used to derive
intransitive verbs mostly from transitive roots. (There are two cases where the
detransitives are derived from the intransitive roots, as we will see below.) The
morpheme has two phonologically conditioned allomorphs: [itk]occurs with roots
which end in /d/ or fl/, and [-&l with other roots. Both the transitive verbs and theirSThe Kiowa verb stem for 'be sitting (pl)' and 'be lying (pl)' is /k7(ll/ (Watkins

The following text is a personal narrative told by one of my older consultants
about her childhood. The text serves two purposes: (a) it illustrates, in natural
discourse, some of the phonological and morphological points discussed in the
preceding chapters; (b) it gives a glimpse into aspects of Jemez life, both past and
present.
After transcribing the text from the tape, I checked my transcription with the
same speaker. During the second session, she explained details and helped to refine the
translation, and in addition, she sometimes made corrections to her original. All the
changes are noted in Section 5.1.4.
Each line is marked with a number enclosed in parentheses in order to make iteasy to relate the text to the translation, the interlinear gloss, and the notes. Each line
represents a single clause or a rnain clause and an embedded clause. A comma indicates
places where the speaker paused.","[264, 265]"
"There are still questions regarding the internal relationship of the language
family. Some linguists-for
(1967)-suggestedinstance, Irvine Davis (1959) and George Tragerthat the family had first split into Kiowa and Tanoan. Others hintedthat this might not be the case. Watkins writes that ""the label Kiowa-Tanoan reflects an
obvious cultural division rather than a linguistic one"" (1984:2).1 (See also Paul
Kroskrity ( 1993:56-57).)
It is not certain if there was any other language in the Towa sub-group. It has
been generally assumed that Pecos spoke another dialect of Towa. Harrington wrote
that Jemez and Pecos were two dialects of the Towa language:
It was also suggested that the dialects of group B be known as constituting the
Towa language, since the term tdwa, meaning ""native,"" is applied by the Jemez
and Pecos to their own language. (Harrington 1910a: 13)
However, the Jemez historian, Joe Sando, rejects this assumption: ""What few words
are known of the Pecos language sound more Tewa than Towa"" (1982: 149).","[18, 19]"

active verb roots (21), descriptive nouns (22), and nouns (23). (All the examplesbelow are perfective forms.)'fill' (gY<'be full')
'sharpen' (kai 'be sharp')
'make someone cry' ($11- 'cry')
'make someone laugh' (hf-l- 'laugh')

'make something wet' (p7Fyk. 'wet one')
'gather, rake' (bi 'whole thing')
'melt' (p3$ 'water')
'write' (tiY 'mark')
The causative verbs are all transitive. Contrast the transitive verbs (24a) - (27a)
with the non-causative (i.e. intransitive) counterparts in (24b)- (27b). The causative
verbs are simple transitives with two arguments, which are encoded as A and P in the
transitive prefixes. The patient (P) in the transitive sentences corresponds to the S of
the intransitive verbs.

Ann Arbor, M1 48103ABSTRACTThis is a descriptive study of Jemez (or Towat-aNative American language ofthe Kiowa-Tanoan family, spoken at the Pueblo of Jemez in New Mexico. It providesa detailed account of the phonology, noun morphology, and verb morphology.
Although the phonological analysis in this work is essentially generative, a
phenomenon-oriented approach is used rather than a model-oriented approach. Data
contained in this dissertation should be readily accessible and comprehensible to other
linguists.
Jemez has a large vowel and consonant inventory. There are 22 vowels,
distinguished by vowel length and nasality as well as tongue height and lip rounding.
Some of the surface consonants have a limited distribution and are derived from
underlying segments. The alternation of various consonants is the most prominent
feature of Jemez phonology, and is useful for understanding the morphology,
particularly the verbal morphology. The language has four surface tones, derived from
three underlying tones.
Just as in other Kiowa-Tanoan languages, Jemez nouns are grouped into four
classes on the basis of what is called 'basic number'. The noun classification is
reflected in the distribution of the nominal 'inverse-number' suffix and coreferential
demonstratives and in the pronominal verbal prefixes which encode grammatical
relations.
There are two ways of grouping Jemez verbs: one is according to the criteria of
transitivity and stativity, which results in four verb types: transitive active, transitive
stative, intransitive active, and intransitive stative. The other is a grouping into
morphological classes of verbs, based on the shared inflectional properties. Thisclassification takes into account the alternations of root-final consonants and tonal
patterns in inflected stems, among others.
The dissertation includes a short narrative. It illustrates, in natural discourse,
some of the phonological and morphological points, and also gives a glimpse into
aspects of Jemez life, both past and present. The appendices include a list of Spanish
loanwords and Jemez numerals.","[4, 5, 6]"
"Furthermore, these prefixes occur when the P of a transitive verb is
unspecified. In the (a) examples below, a basic-number P corresponds to the patient in
(123a), to the source of a transferred object in (124a), and to the recipient in (125a). In
the (b) examples, on the other hand, P is unspecified in (123b)-(125b)' so the
'Reflexive, Plural P, Indefinite P' prefix /til-l occurs.

"4.5.3. Transitive active verbs
Transitive verbs are characterized by having active and passive forms. They are
two-place predicates and CO-occurin active sentences with transitive prefixes, which
index A and P. (See Section 4.6 for the discussion of syntactic roles.)

(= That man punched me.)'dB $6--tq i-t6-sb(that man-agt intr[lsg]-punch/psv.pf)While most transitive verbs can take any transitive prefix, there is a subclass of
transitive verbs which occur only with a subset of transitive prefixes which I tentatively
call 'reflexive/indefinite object' prefixes. (See Section 4.6.1 for the details.) These'reflexive' verbs are structurally intransitive, i.e., there is only one argument, and many
of them refer to actions performed with the body, particularly the mouth or the legs.
They are listed in (78) below.13 They are still considered a subtype of transitive verbs'3[hp7~*]
'laugh, smile' is not inherently a reflexive verb because it can occur with any
transitive prefix-not just the reflexive prefixes. [tahfrg*]'I laughed at him'; [titfilh*]'I
laughed, smiled'. Many of the verbs listed in (78) contain the verb root P&/ 'do,
make', but this is not a defining characteristic of 'reflexive' verbs, as the above
example shows. [m@Sap*]'borrow' can also take a non-reflexive transitive prefix.",[185]
"3.7.1. Possessive marking by benefactive prefixesThe most common way of asserting possession is by means of intransitive
benefactive preilxes.18 The intransitive benefactive prefixes are typically attached to the
copula re/ 'be' or the stative verbs of position to indicate a possessor. The possessed
objects occurring in such constructions can be animate or inanimate. The examplesentences (75) through (77) literally mean 'X (possessed object) is (lying down) for
me'. Note that / k W has a different plural form /g%*/.l9

beneficiary of an action. (See Sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.4 for the details.)

usually realized as depalatalized velar-B?] and [g], respectively. For the details of the
alternation between palatalized and depalatalized velar stops, see Chapter 2, Section
2.5.8.",[142]
"1.2. Jemez and the Kiowa-Tanoan language family
Jernez belongs to the Kiowa-Tanoan language family. It is the only member of
the Towa branch of the family. The other branches are Tewa, Tiwa, and Kiowa.
Tewa, Tiwa, and Towa are generally grouped as ""Tanoan"" languages. It was John
Powell(189 1) who first used the name ""Taiioan"" to group them. He treated Kiowa as
constituting a different family ""Kiowan"" at the time. J. P. Harrington (1910a) was the
first to propose the classification of the Tanoan languages into three branches-Tewa,
Tiwa, and Towa. He also noted similarities in vocabulary and sounds between Kiowa
and Tanoan languages (Harrington 191Ob). The genetic relationship between these
groups of languages is well established through the comparative works of Wick Miller
(19591, George and Edith Trager (Trager and Trager 1959), Kenneth Hale (1962,1967), and Laurel Watkins (1 977, 1978).",[18]
"Similarly, (107a) contains a kinship verb with an intransitive prefix and an intransitive
benefactive prefix on the main verb. In (l07b), the main verb is marked by an
intransitive prefix, not an intransitive benefactive prefix.

from other word classes. The Jemez equivalents of adjectives found in other languagesare mostly stative verbs. In addition, there are descriptive words which cooccur with
the copula and behave like nouns. The qualification of nouns is usually done by
relativized verbs, including the copula, or by compounded noun modifiers, as we saw
in Section 3.3.
First, let us look at the structural characteristics of stative verbs modifying
nouns. In (108a) and (109a)' the verb /N'bright' occurs as the predicate of the
sentence. In ( l OBb), (109b), and ( 109~)'it qualifies the noun /wQh~/'star', formingan NP with the nominalizer /-?6/ which functions as the P of 'see'. The norninalized
clause shows the expected agreement with a Class I noun.""

(1 13) Compounding and incorporation (nouns, verbs)Non-initial Root H LoweringL Spread

Velar Stop Depalatalization applies to the stem-initial velar stop when it is preceded by abenefactive prefix. The Low Vowel Fronting rule changes the root-final vowel /a/ to[se], when it is followed by the inverse-number suffix /-S/.",[103]
"Even when a syllable-final consonant occurs on the surface, there is a tendency
toward a CV template in the language, i.e. a tendency toward eliminating a closed
syllable in favor of an open syllable. For instance, the 'inverse' suffix /-Uis often
omitted from the noun stem, and when it does occur before a verb stem with a
pronominal prefix, speakers usually pause slightly between the noun stem and the
suffix, and pronounce [S] and the following vowel (i.e. the initial vowel of the
pronominal prefix on the verb) as one syllable: e.g. [v8*la:Sijq 'Men (du) fell off' <
/v&la-S P-Si/ (man-inv intr[3du]-fall.sg/pf). In the early 1920's Elsie Clews Parsons'
(Parsons 192570) transcription [ywa' kishi sernihy] 'your children send' suggests
that the pronominal verbal prefix [i] was already phonetically bound to the inverse
number suffix [-sh] in [kjshi].)
Word-internally, closed syllables are not possible in present-day Jemez, but it
appears that there used to be a consonant cluster of word-medial [t] plus a stop
consonant in the language: [pdpa'] '(term for) September-October' (Parsons 1925:75).
Although long consonants also occur, they are not contrastive. Voiceless stops,
particularly lpl, N and Ity/,are lengthened if the preceding vowel is short and stressed:
e.g. 14itYimv[@itYtYirnd
'weak';lsipaeyd [sippaeya] 'marry'. l l
There is a remaining question of whether Jemez has true vowel-initial syllables.
What appear to be syllable-initial vowels in some roots start at a low pitch level, the
pitch quickly rising as the vowel is pronounced. Often a voiced glottal fricative [fi] is
heard before the vowel: e.g. [fii.p7ae] 'yesterday'. l2 ' [fi] is present at least in rootinitial syllables. Hale (1967) points out that in all the Kiowa-Tanoa languages except
1lThe double consonant symbols here indicate long consonants; they do not mean
rearticulated geminate consonants.
l2Laurel Watkins (personal communication) observes a similar low-high tonal pattern
on syllable-initial vowels and on vowels which follow an initial voiced consonant, and
argues that there is a voiced laryngeal /W at the beginning of what appear to be vowelinitial syllables.","[38, 39]"

generously made copies of his Jemez grammar notes available to me and other

know the language better.","[7, 8]"
"2.4. Suprasegmentals
2.4.1. Surface tones and their distributionJemez uses pitch differences for lexical and grammatical contrast. At the
surface level, there are four tones: High (H), Low (L), Falling (F), and Mid (M). H is
represented by [' ] above a vowel, F by [""I, M by I'1, and L is unmarked.
Phonetically, H and L are level. F has an onset lower in pitch than that for H, and it is
followed by a quick drop in pitch. F on a short vowel starts at an even lower pitch thanF on a long vowel. M is generally level, but sometimes it has a short downglide. Its
onset is perceptually close to that of F.
The distribution of tones relative to positions within words differs between
native Jemez words and Spanish loanwords. To summarize the differences: in
Spanish loanwords, (a) L tone can occur in an initial syllable in polysyllabic stems; (b)F tone is found in non-initial syllables; (c) a L-tone syllable may be followed by a H-18The word is sometimes pronounced [veymiJ.
19In a small set of verbs, [v] systematically alternates with [p] in inflection: e.g. [gyipe]
'bend/pf, potn, inc', [gyfve]'bendimpf"". In the verb for 'enter', [z] occurs steminitially in some inflectional forms (e.g. potential and imperfective), while [P] is found
in perfective and imperative stems.",[45]
"Although surface F and L must logically be treated as underlyingly different
since M and L contrast, and F and M belong to the same underlying tone, the
relationship between these surface tones is not straightforward. They are never found261n the analysis, only native Jemez words were used, since many Spanish loanwords
exhibit different tonal patterns.

3.4.1. Basic and inverse numberOne of the important features shared by Kiowa-Tanoan languages is that nouns
are grouped into four classes on the basis of what is called 'basic number'. In Jemez,
the basic number for Class I nouns is singular; that is, when a Class I noun occurs
without the suffix /-S/, it indicates singularity. When the suffix is added to the stem,
the noun is considered to be dual or plural. Generally speaking, this suffix changes the
number of the noun from its basic number to its 'inverse', that is, its complementary
number. Thus the inverse of singular in Class I nouns is dual and plural.
For Class II nouns, the basic number is plural, so its inverse number is singular
and dual. The basic number of Class III nouns is singular and pkural, the inverse of
which is dual. Class IV nouns are so grouped because they do not'occur with the
suffix /-S/. This is the distribution of the basic number in Jemez, and interestingly the
basic numkr has exactly the same distribution in Jemez and Rio Grande Tewa (R.
Speirs 1986), although the class membership of individual nouns differs among these
languages. Other Kiowa-Tanoan languages have different distributions. In Kiowa, the
basic number is singularldual (Class I), duaVplura1 (Class II), dual (Class m),and no
basic/inverse distinction in Class TV nouns (Watkins 1984:79).","[113, 114]"

the ""ergative"" and the ""absolutive"" (i.e. the A and P of transitive predicates). However,
with a few ditransitive verbs, P indicates the recipient rather than the transferred object.",[192]

All but one noun in this class, only some of which are listed here, are indexed
only with the basic-number verbal prefixes, but [hi] 'flour' occurs with both the basicnumber and the non-inverse plural prefixes on verbs. Thus there are two subsets of
nouns in the class.
Sprott (1 992) recognizes mass nouns as Class N, but he favors ""redefining it
on the basis of verbal morphology rather than nominal."" In other words, whether a
noun takes the inverse suffix 1-51should not be the deciding factor (1992:96). His
argument is summarized in (41).
(41)a. Some of what he groups as Class IV nouns appear to show singularlplural
distinction in the verbal prefixes-justlike nouns of other classes-butthe nouns themselves (i.e. no inverse suffix): [sfm]not in'sand', [w&*sa]'ice',[@6*lb] 'hair', [w6h071k] 'dough' (1992:93-94).10 They can take both the basicnumber and the non-inverse plural prefixes.
b. Other nouns do not show such a number distinction in verbal agreement.","[127, 128, 129]"

Another quantifier which denotes a large size, [yk*],can be used instead of P a d , thus
we have two more forms for 'being big': [ykbe] (sg), [yhM](du/pl). (See Section4.5.6 for a further discussion of intransitive stative verbs.)

than 'big'), and take the copula /-%l when they occur as the predicate of the sentence,as in ( l lOa), (1 lob), ( l l la), (l l lb). As noun modifiers, these words are foIlowed by
the copula, and the resulting clause is norninalized, as in (1 1 0 ~ )(' l lOd), ( I l lc),
( 1 l Id). These descriptive words can take the inverse suffix, just like nouns. In ( l lob)and (l lOd), the noun is inverse, so rilzbe] is followed by the inverse suffix 1-31. The

Of the words with four or more syllables, almost ail in my data are
compounds.24 They exhibit the same surface tonal patterns found in words with one to
three syllables. For example, the initial syllable can carry H or F in native words. H in
non-initial syllable occurs only if the preceding syllable carries H tone, e.g. n@nise7yZ
'oriole' (no-ni 'cottonwood'). M tone typically appears after a F syllable or wordfinally on a short vowel, e.g. p?6=lide?lg'turkey', w8-traSili 'blue' (w&t7b 'not ripe').","[48, 49]"
"discusses 'Noun Phrase', 'Verb Phrase', 'Location Phrase', and 'Time Phrase', butshe tends to describe only the sequence of words in particular phrases without giving
adequate morphological information. Like Martin (1964), her phoneme inventory is
based on the classical phonemic approach. She does not indicate tones or stress in her
phonetic transcription. In addition to the discussion of phrases, Myers provides a
vocabulary list and the transcription of three informal talks.
Laurel Watkins presented papers on aspects of Jemez phonology and verbal
morphology at linguistic conferences (Watkins 1990a & 1990b).
Robert Sprott's 1992 doctoral dissertation ""Jemez Syntax"" includesphonological and morphological analysis. Among the morpho-syntactic topics covered
are the passive and incorporation. In addition, he provides a detailed analysis of Jemez
pronominal prefixes in the framework of relational grammar. The most elaborated part
of his work is the interlinear annotation of three biblical stories, as retold in Jemez by a
Jemez man. Sprott's phoneme inventory is similar to mine, but there is a considerable'difference in our treatments of suprasegmentals. In fact, he did not undertake the
analysis of tones.
There are three instrumental studies of Jemez phonetics. Alan Bell (1992)
discusses some issues related to Jemez prosody, including tones and stress. Rebecca
Heins (1993) provides formant values for the Jemez vowel system. Heins (1994) is an
MA thesis on the stop consonants in Jernez.","[20, 21]"

"The terms 'inverse number' and 'basic number' were first used by Wonderly,
Gibson, and Kirk (1954), in their paper on number in Kiowa:The suffix (9)
is then described as marking the INVERSE (abbreviated inv.)
number; i.e. it inverts the basic number to the categories not implicit in the stem.
Thus it changes the duaVsingular of class I nouns to plural, and the duaVplura1
basic number of class II to singular. (1954:3)
Since then, the suffix /-g31 in Kiowa and its counterparts in other Kiowa-Tanoan
languages have been referred to as the 'inverse suffix' or 'inverse-number suffix' by
Kiowa-Tanoanists.","[114, 115]"

discussed in Section 4.7 'Passivization', passivization is normally not possible when
the A is first or second person. The use of the detransitive potentiai form in an
