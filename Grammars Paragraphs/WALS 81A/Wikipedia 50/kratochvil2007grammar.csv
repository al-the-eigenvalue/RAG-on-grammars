In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[153, 154, 155, 156]"
"1.5Earlier descriptions of the Abui languageAs mentioned in 1.3, Abui language was briefly studied by Martha M. Nicolspeyer. Her
dissertation includes an appendix containing a number of glossed texts in Abui as well
as an Abui-Dutch wordlist, but no grammatical analysis. A first linguistic description
was Stokhof (1984).4 In his analysis, Stokhof first defines the area where Abui is spoken
and shows its relationship with other non-Austronesian languages of the Alor-Pantar
area. The descriptive part of the paper is based on a text from Du Bois that describes
an uprising in September 1918.
Stokhof gives a basic overview of Abui phonology as spoken in Ateng Melang.
It differs from Takalelang Abui phonology (as described in this book) in having the
phonemes /g, v/, and a number of vowel sequences /uɛ, ɑu, ɑɔ, ɔu, ɔɛ/ (cf. Stokhof,
1984:116).
In nominal morphology, two types of possessive inflection are identified:
inalienable and alienable. Inalienably possessed nouns are semantically characterized as
referring to body parts or kinship relations (1984:120). Pronominal prefixes containing
*t- are described as having generic reference. In verbal morphology, Stokhof
distinguishes free and bound verb stems. Bound verb stems obligatorily combine with a
pronominal prefix (1984:124).
In syntax, Stokhof claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent
fronting is mentioned (1984:137). In an NP, modifiers follow heads in the order:
attribution, quantification, specification (1984:139). In a clause, the phrases expressing
temporal settings of an event precede the arguments. The sketch provides rich
comparative data with other Alorese languages such as Kabola or Woisika, as well as
Timorese Bunak.",[28]

typological characteristics of a language such as phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Foley (1998, 506-515) listed a number of typological features (phonological,
morphological and syntactic), which distinguish Austronesian languages from NonAustronesian languages. In what follows, I specify a number of diagnostic features,
listed by Foley (1998), for Abui. A list of features for three grammatical domains is
followed by a section in which Abui features are evaluated in the context of
Austronesian and Papuan languages, as discussed by Foley (1998, 2000).
Features of Abui phonology:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)five phonemic vowels
four phonemic places of articulation for stops (labial, alveodental, velar,
and glottal)
voicing distinction only in labial and alveodental stops
restricted fricatives /f, s, h/
two liquids /l ~r/
open and closed syllables, no consonant clusters
final stress, iambic feet with optional extrametrical syllable10CHAPTER IEvaluation: It is common for Papuan languages to have five phonemic vowels, but the
same holds also for Austronesian languages. Abui lacks prenasalized stops, commonly
found in other TNG languages, and instead voiced stops are found. Fricatives are
restricted, as is common in Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:367-8). There is also
phonemic contrast between stop [t] and the flap [r], and there are two liquids [l] and [r].
Both of these features are not very common in TNG languages; but are almost
universal in Austronesian languages (cf. Pawley, 1998:670-4; Foley, 2000:369). Papuan
languages typically lack consonant clusters, or use epenthetic vowels to split them (cf.
Foley, 2000:369), but many Austronesian languages of Eastern Indonesia show the
same tendency (Klamer, 2002:367). We can conclude that Abui shares some
characteristics with Papuan languages, and some with the Austronesian languages
surrounding it.
Features of Abui morphology:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)
(viii)agglutinative morphological structure, elaborate verbal morphology
developed inflectional morphology (aspect, person)
prefixes for person inflection, suffixes for aspect inflection
nouns inflect only for possessor
no case inflection of NPs, no gender
no agreement for subject/actor
verbs may combine with up to three bound aspectual markers (two
suffixes, one clitic)
roots display categorial indeterminacy, sharp division only between
prototypical nouns (persons) and verbsEvaluation: Abui nouns do not inflect for number nor are they classified for gender, as
is common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:371-2). Nouns are classified
through posture verbs such as ‘stand’, ‘sit’ – long-shaped objects ‘stand’, flat-shaped
objects ‘lie’ etc. Such classification systems are well-known from some of the highland
languages (cf. Lang, 1975). There is no case in Abui, grammatical relations are signalled
with pronominal prefixes on the verb or by additional verbs employed in serial verb
construction. Abui has semantic alignment, a feature also found in other languages in
Eastern Indonesia, Papuan as well as Austronesian (cf. Klamer, To appear-a). Pronouns
in Abui show an inclusive/exclusive distinction, which is typical for Austronesian
languages, but rarely found among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376).
Agglutinative morphological structure and elaborate verbal morphology are
typical TNG features, including the common distinction between ‘medial’ and ‘final’
verbs. In Abui, final verbs are typically fully inflected, medial verbs lack inflection.
While verbs in many TNG languages typically carry subject suffixes, Abui lacks such
subject suffixes. Instead, pronominal prefixes co-indexing undergoers are found, which
are common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:378). Abui roots display a high
degree of categorial indeterminacy. It contrasts with the typical situation in Papuan
languages which make a sharp distinction between nouns and verbs, and in this respect
Abui sides with Austronesian languages that commonly display a high degree of
categorial indeterminacy (cf. Foley, 2000:370).","[31, 32, 33]"
"INTRODUCTION11As in other Papuan languages, Abui has a small class of verbs (referred to as
generic verbs in this study) that derive new verbs. This is a feature specific of Papuan
languages (cf. Foley, 2000:386). Generic verbs also frequently combine with other
verbs, and then function as auxiliaries. Abui has no ditransitive verbs and most verbs
may occur in both transitive and intransitive construction. These features are common
among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376-7).
Features of Abui syntax:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)basic Actor-Undergoer-Verb (AUV) constituent, pragmatic UAV order
no adpositions (instead, serial verb constructions are used)
anaphoric demonstratives follow the noun
modifiers follow the head noun (only deictic demonstratives precede)
frequent clause chaining without conjunctionsEvaluation: Abui shows clause chaining and tail-head linkage, which are both
commonly found among Papuan languages. It is also very rich in serial verb
constructions. Switch reference, sometimes found in TNG languages (cf. Foley,
2000:384), is not found in Abui. In sum, Abui has many features that are typically
Papuan, but also shares some features with the Austronesian languages of Eastern
Indonesia. There is a possibility that Papuan languages of Alor-Pantar predated the
Austronesian languages (cf. Pawley, 2005-b:100). In that case, it is expected that there
has been diffusion of features from Austronesian to Papuan and vice versa (cf. Klamer
et.al., In press).","[33, 34]"
"178CHAPTER Vevent[SEMANTIC PROPERTIES OF THE EVENT]participant[INHERENT SEMANTIC PROPERTIES]macroroleAU[+CONTROL]
[+VOLITION][+AFFECTED]Figure 18: Semantic features identifying participants for A and U macroroleInherent semantic properties of the participants (animacy) may be sufficient to
determine the direction, in which an event was performed; i.e. who is acting upon
whom. In most cases, participants identified as actor are animate. They are moving,
consuming, cutting etc; they are characterized by features [+CONTROL] and [+VOLITION]
(in that order). On the other hand, participants identified as undergoer tend to be
inanimate. They are consumed, moved, cut; and so on; so in general, they are
characterized as [+AFFECTED].
As mentioned in section 3.2.3, Abui nouns do not display any case inflection.
When arguments are expressed as lexical NPs, the semantic roles of the arguments are
determined by the animacy of their referents. This is illustrated in (1), where a transitive
and an intransitive construction are given. In both constructions, the verb occurs in the
final position; the arguments precede the verb. In (a), the verb nee ‘eat’ combines with
the NPs ama ‘person’ and sieng ‘rice’. The NP ama ‘human’ has an animate referent
and is identified as the A argument. The NP sieng ‘rice’ is identified as the U argument
because it is inanimate. In (b), the NP fala ‘house’ is the single argument of the verb fak
‘break’. It is identified as the U argument because it is affected by course of the event.
(1)a. amasiengneeperson rice
eat
‘someone eats rice/people eat rice’b. falafak-ihouse break-PFV
‘a house broke down’In transitive constructions, the order of arguments expressed as lexical NPs is
determined pragmatically. This is illustrated in (2)-(3), where the syntactic order of the
NPs does not indicate whether they should be identified as A or U arguments. The NP
ama ‘person, people’ has an animate referent. It is identified as the A argument. The
NPs kawen ‘machete’ and bataa ‘wood’ are identified as U arguments because their
referent is inanimate. This shows that the semantic role of an argument is identified by
the animacy of the referent. In pragmatically neutral order, the A argument precedes
the U argument. When the order of arguments is reversed, the semantic roles assigned
to the arguments do not change. Instead, the construction with the reversed NP
ordering is pragmatically marked; the fronted NP expressing the U argument is in
focus.","[200, 201]"
"4.4.4QuantifiersIn an NP, quantifiers (QUANT) indicate the quantity of the referent. In Abui, there are
two types of quantifiers: (i) numeral quantifiers that express the exact quantity of the
countable referent (see 4.4.4.1); (ii) non-numeral quantifiers that express a fuzzy
quantity of both countable and uncountable referents (see 4.4.4.2). Both types of
quantifiers are discussed in section 3.5.3. In an NP, quantifiers follow the head noun.
4.4.4.1
Numeral quantifiers
A number of NPs with numeral quantifiers are given in (85). In all cases the numeral
follows the head noun:

‘one man and one woman, they gave birth, two sons (were born)’[B02.023.00:03]As discussed in 4.4.1, nouns with inanimate reference denote substances rather than
well-defined objects. In quantified NPs, these nouns combine with modifier nouns that
specify their shape and size in order to be enumerated. In their function, modifier
nouns are very much like classifiers. The modifier noun bika ‘kernel’ co-occurs in
enumeration with nouns denoting smallish round objects, as illustrated in (87).
(87)na-wetbika nuku1SG.INAL-tooth kernel
‘one tooth of mine’oneh-ièngbikaayoku3II.INAL-eye kernel

(88)kabala kasingkar-nukucloth
splinter
ten-one
‘ten pieces of cloth’faala kasing nuku
slab splinter one
‘one slab (on the poles of the house)’The modifier nouns may also appear in enumeration of human and animal referents to
indicate generic (non-specific) reference. In (89), the nouns moku ‘kid’ , fe ‘pig’, ama
kang ‘person’, and ura ‘sibling’ combine with the modifier noun upi ‘fruit’ to refer to a
number of unspecified referents.

given in (90), where the head noun toku ‘leg’ combines with numerals ayoku ‘two’ and
buti ‘four’. The NP refers to two- and four-legged domestic animals.
(90)he-toku ayokubuti3II.AL-leg two

Non-numeral quantifiers
A fuzzy quantity of the referent is expressed by non-numeral quantifiers (see also
section 3.5.3.2). Non-numeral quantifiers follow the head noun. There are three nonnumeral quantifiers that will be discussed here; the plural quantifier loku (PL), the
quantifier kabei ‘few, little’ and faring ‘much, many’.
The quantifier loku expresses the plural quantity and is glossed as (PL). The
quantifier loku (PL) can never be followed by a numeral, which proves that it is not an
instance of plural inflection but a plural quantifier. It combines with referents that are
countable and individuated; such referents are mostly human. The meaning of the
quantifier loku (PL) can be translated with ‘many’ or ‘several’ or with a plural form of
the modified noun; nevertheless, these translations seem to be less felicitous as glosses.
A number of examples are given in (91):
(91)nenglokuruwolman

with the NP moku loku. The head noun moku ‘kid’ is quantified with loku (PL).
(92)moku loku sakolahe-seikid

3II.LOC-come.down.CNT
‘the children come down for school’[B03.003.02]In (93), the quantifier loku (PL) occurs with the noun fe ‘pig’ in (a). It was used in a
situation where the speaker referred to four pigs. In (b), the noun fír ‘star’ is combined
with loku (PL) to mean a high number of stars. Clearly, the quantifier loku (PL)
indicates “more than one”.
(93)a. felokub. fírpig
PL
‘pigs’lokustar PL
‘stars’In (94), the quantifier loku (PL) combines with proper names that refer to persons,
groups, or areas. However, the NPs that consist of these nouns and the quantifier loku
(PL) do not simply refer to the plural number of these referents but to a group of
people associated with the persons, groups or areas expressed by the proper name. A
number of examples is also given in (11) above.

‘Takalelang people’The quantifier loku is a constituent that occurs exclusively in the NP domain (see also
section 4.3.4). The other non-numeral quantifiers may combine with verbs, as discussed
in section 3.5.3.2.
The quantifier kabei ‘little’ indicates a small number of a countable referent and
a small quantity of an uncountable referent.

‘the kepala adat7, he will bring around a little bit of money’[B13.010.36:51]The quantifier faring ‘many, much’ indicates a large number of countable
referents or a large quantity of uncountable referents. In (97), the quantifier faring
‘many, much’ quantifies the NP ama kang ‘people’:
(97)amakangfaring meperson be.good

[B02.098.16:52]Combinations of adnominal modifiersThe order of adnominal modifiers in an NP is fixed. As discussed in section 4.4, only
the deictic demonstratives (DEICT) precede the head noun; other modifiers follow the
head noun. The order of modifiers is schematically represented in (98), which is a
repetition of the same scheme given in (67):The Malay word kepala adat refers to the ‘head of custom, habbits’; that is somebody with the traditional
knowledge who is able to negotiate and enter various contracts in a culturally recognized way.","[186, 187, 188, 189]"
"5.8Development of Abui bound pronounsAbui pronouns seem to be cognate to the pronominal forms found in other Papuan
languages of Alor-Pantar area. The formal relation goes even further to the mainland
languages of the Trans New Guinea family (TNG), cf. section 1.6. The reconstructed
proto-TNG forms *na and *ka (Foley, 2000) are found in 1st and 2nd singular
respectively and in 1st plural. The velar proto-TNG root [k] indicating second person is
possibly related to Abui glottal [ʔ] that characterizes second person singular. In Papuan
languages, the singular vs. plural number is indicated by the vowel alternation *a ~*i
(cf. Foley, 2000:362; Ross, 2006:29); in Abui, this alternation is found as well. In (Ross
2005), a reconstructed inclusive suffix *-p is given. It is possible that this form is also
the source of Abui inclusive forms pi (1PL.I), po-/pu- (1PL U arguments), and pi- (1PL U
arguments and possessors).
There is cross-linguistic evidence that diachronically the pronouns were
morphologically complex. The consonant roots identify the person while the vowel
roots mark the number (cf. Foley, 2000:362). In Abui these basic composed
pronominal forms fused later with the generic verbs *a ‘be at’, *e ‘add, continue’, and *o
‘point’ (cf. Klamer and Kratochvíl 2006). In (60), I illustrate the development for206CHAPTER Vsingular bound pronouns. In all given cases, the vowel root [ɑ] that codes the singular
number was deleted. The pronominal form and the generic verb fused into a single
morpheme and became grammaticalized as prefixes.5

preserved. In (b), the high vowel fused with the lower vowel and was preserved. The
resulting prefix has the same form as the PAT prefix. In (c), the high front vowel was
deleted resulting in the REC prefix ro-, or in other dialects ru-. The vowel alternation
seems to reflect the diachronic development. In sum, (60) and (61) suggest that the
pronominal prefixes originate from a serial verb construction. Although this might
seem unlikely at the first sight, there are other serial constructions reminiscent of these
proposed constructions (see 8.4.2). The possessive prefixes developed along the same
path as shown in (62).

"2SG what

‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place

intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES129(178) a. Simon nala nee

are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.

"3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and wordexternal (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to timestable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[89, 90]"

Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.
NOUNS. Abui nouns are only identified unambiguously by their referential properties
when they have animate referents. Inanimate nouns are typically underspecified for
number, shape, or size; in other words, their reference is generic. Many lexical items are
categorially indetermined and may refer to objects and substances as well as to events.
Abui nouns are divided in two groups by possessive inflection. Inherently
possessed nouns require possessive inflection. Semantically these are body parts and
kinship terms. This distinction is illustrated in (3), where the bound nominal stem min
‘nose’ combines with the inalienable possessive prefix na- (1SG.INAL). In (b), the noun
fala ‘house’ belongs to the second group of optionally possessed nouns. The possessive
prefix ne- (1SG.AL) marks the alienable possession. In third person, the possessor is
optionally expressed with a noun that precedes the possessum denoting noun, as
illustrated in (c).

(PROPOSS), with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives
(DEICT), modifier nouns (NMOD), stative verbs (V), adjectives (ADJ), quantifiers (QUANT),
and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) in a fixed order, as illustrated in (4).
(4)NP Æ(DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)Optionally, an NP may be modified by a modifier linked to the head noun with the
linker ba (LNK); typically, a relative clause (RC). The linked modifier may either precede
or follow the head noun as illustrated in (5). It forms a single intonational unit with the
modified NP. In (a), the modifier clause precedes the head noun bataa ‘wood’. In (b),
the modifier clause follows the head noun. The second order is more common.

Controlling and volitional participants of an event are identified as actors. Actors are
realized as A arguments with NPs and/or free pronouns. This is illustrated in (6). In (a),
the A argument is expressed with the NP maama ‘father’ and the free pronoun di (3A);
in (b), the A argument is expressed by the free pronoun di (3A).

‘s/he/they came’Affected participants of an event are identified as undergoers and realized as U
arguments with NPs and/or bound pronouns. This is illustrated in (7). In (a), the U
argument is expressed with the NP wil ‘child’ and with the bound pronoun ho(3II.REC). In (b), the U argument is expressed with the bound pronoun no- (1SG.REC).

1SG.REC-hot-be.at
‘I feel hot’There are three sets of bound pronouns that express arguments with a specific
reference. Their distribution is determined by the semantic features of the participantsINTRODUCTION15such as [±change of state] and [±individuated]. In (8), the U argument of the verb loi
‘put far, chase’ is realized in a number of constructions.

1SG.LOC-give
‘Simon chases me’DISTR.REC-3II.PAT-put.farIn (a), the U argument nala nuku ‘something’ is co-indexed as LOC; it has a specific
non-individuated referent that must be understood in a very broad sense as ‘purpose’ or
‘reason’. In (b), the same U argument is co-indexed as REC; its referent is
[+individuated] and probably a human or some other clearly distinguished referent. In
(c), the U argument kaai ‘dog’ is affected by the event chasing, and effectively chased
away. While in (a) and (b) the meaning of the verb loi was translated as ‘bark’, the
translation ‘chase’ is more appropriate in (c). As illustrated in (d), the use of the PAT
bound pronoun is not felicitous to refer to first and second person participants.
Instead, the benefactive serial construction with the generic verb l ‘give’ must be used.
The first person participant is expressed as the U argument of the verb l ‘give’. Note
that the verb loi ‘put far’ combines with two bound pronouns. The distributive form
to- (DISTR.REC) refers to a plural number of participants that are ‘recipients’ of chasing.
The PAT form ha- (3II.PAT) indicates that a single participant is chased. The first person
prefix may not appear here. The combinations of prefixes in double U transitive
constructions are restricted.
Depending on its semantic properties a single participant of an event may be
expressed as different types of arguments of the same verb. In (9), the single participant
of the event of ‘leaving (towards a DC)’ is expressed as actor (a), experiencer (b), and
undergoer (c).

stems may be combined with the REC prefix. This is illustrated in (10), where the verb16CHAPTER Ilàk ‘leave for’ combines with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC) in (a). The noun fala ‘house’ in
(b) may not combine with the REC prefix.

events with distinct telic properties. There are three basic distinctions made depending
on the inner temporal structure of the event. Inceptive stems (ICP) indicate events that
have an initial point. Completive stems (CPL) indicate events that have a final point.
Continuative stems (CNT) indicate events that are viewed as having neither initial nor
final point.

"8.2Symmetrical serial verb constructionsThe verbs in symmetrical SVCs (SSVC) belong to unrestricted sets (as already discussed
in 8.1.2). They do not show any dependency in respect of each other. In general, the
linear ordering of the verbs in a SSVC is the same as order of sub-events building up the
reported event. However, the choice of the verbs reporting various sub-events is
conventionalised as an event has to be reported in a culturally and conventionally
accepted way (cf. Bruce, 1988; Pawley, 1991).4
The SSVC is sometimes indicated by the presence of an aspectual marker
between two verbs. In (13) the verb ban ‘carry’ combines with the aspectual marker te
(INCP.C) that is not shared with the verb sei ‘come down’. Both verbs form a SSCV
characterized by its intonational properties.
(13)ban=tesei!carry.CPL=INCP.C
‘bring it down!’come.down.CNT[B02.060.24:01]The borders of a SSVC may be fuzzy, which makes it difficult to determine whether a
SVC is symmetrical, asymmetrical, or hybrid. In (14) the verb me ‘come’ may be
interpreted to be part of two SVCs. It either indicates the direction in which theThis type of SVCs is found in other Papuan languages consisting sometimes of more than five verbs in
languages such as Kalam (Pawley, 1987; 1991; 1993; 2004) or Kobon (Davies, 1984).",[376]
"4.4Noun PhrasesA noun phrase (NP) is a syntactic constituent headed by a noun. It expresses the
argument of a verb. In Abui, the head noun of an NP combines with a number of
adnominal modifiers such as modifier nouns, adjectives, stative verbs, demonstratives,156CHAPTER IVand quantifiers. Modifier nouns (NMOD) specify some property of the referred entity
such as shape, size, age, or gender. Adjectives and stative verbs (ADJ/V) specify some
property of head nouns such as colour, quality, size, taste etcetera. Demonstratives
(DEM) are modifiers expressing something about the identifiability and referentiality of
an NP in space or discourse. Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are
referred to as deictic demonstratives (DEICT); demonstratives that locate the referent in
discourse are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). As discussed in section 3.5.2, both
subtypes of demonstratives are differentiated by their syntactic position in an NP. The
deictic demonstratives precede the head noun while the anaphoric demonstratives
follow it. Quantifiers (QUANT) express something about the quantity of referents
realized as a noun phrase. As discussed in section 3.5.3, there are two subtypes of
quantifiers: the numerals and non-numeral quantifiers. Quantifiers always follow the
head noun. In Abui, there are complex NPs that contain more than one adnominal
modifier. In such complex NPs, the adnominal modifiers combine in fixed order
schematically illustrated in (67). Of all adnominal modifiers, only deictic demonstratives
(DEICT) and possessors (NPOSS) may precede the head noun, which may carry possessive
inflection (PROPOSS) discussed in section 4.2. The nouns, adjectives, stative verbs,
numeral and non-numeral quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives must follow the
head noun.6
(67)NP Æ(DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)In the following sections, I will give an overview of each adnominal modifier type. In
section 4.4.1, I describe the modifier nouns that combine with the head noun. In
section 4.4.2, I give an overview of the verbs and adjectives. The demonstratives are
discussed in section 4.4.3. In 4.4.4, I describe the quantifiers. The combinations of
adnominal modifiers in complex NPs are described in section 4.4.5. In section 4.5, I
discuss related complex structures characterized by the intersective linker ba (LNK). In
these structures, a complex modifier (an NP or a clause) is linked by the intersective
linker ba (LNK) to a head noun.","[178, 179]"
"Stokhof (1984:137) states that the modifiers follow the head in the order: attribution, quantification,
specification.",[179]

"3.5.1AdjectivesIn Abui, the grammatical category of adjectives contains only six items. They refer to
the properties of participants such as colour, size or age just as stative verbs (see
3.4.4.8). Adjectives are differentiated from the stative verbs because they cannot head a
VP. This is illustrated in (120), where the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’
modify the head noun (a, b), and cannot head a VP (c, d). In order to be used as head
of a VP, the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’ must combine with a generic root
in a complex verb. In (e, f), the adjectives combine with the generic root ì ‘put’.",[132]

[B10.051.06]The last derivational strategy that derives new nouns employs the non-numeral
quantifier loku (PL). As discussed in section 4.4.4.2, the quantifier loku (PL) is an
adnominal modifier that follows the head noun. The quantifier loku (PL) indicates that
the referent is individuated (mostly human) and occurs in plural number. Any stem that
is followed by the quantifier loku (PL) is interpreted non-predicatively and serves as the
head of an NP. This is illustrated in (65) where a number of verbal stems combine with
loku (PL).

linker and one arrives at forms listed above.

constituent.","[177, 178]"
"8.3.2SVCs with minor verbs expressing directionIn SVCs of direction, a number of motion verbs such as marang ‘come up’, sei ‘come
down’, me ‘come’, we ‘leave’, and lol ‘walk’ are used as minor verbs indicating
direction.10 The minor verb shares a single A argument with the major verb. In what
follows, I discuss a number of directional SVCs with the minor verbs marang ‘come
up’ (8.3.2.1), sei ‘come down’ (8.3.2.2), me ‘come’ (8.3.2.3), we ‘leave’ (8.3.2.4), and lol
‘walk’ (8.3.2.5).
8.3.2.1
SVC with marang ‘come up’
The minor verb marang ‘come up’ refers to an upward direction or orientation of the
activity expressed by the major verb. Consider the situation in which somebody comes
running up the hill. In that case the construction given in (41) can be used to order
somebody else to run up as next. The major verb luol ‘gain’ combines with marang
‘come up’ that encodes the upward direction of the ‘following’.
10Directional SVCs are found in many other Papuan languages (Foley 1986:149-152).",[385]

Nominalized Verb Phrases
In Abui, there are verb phrases that are used non-predicatively. These verb phrases are
nominalised and possibly lexicalized; they combine with adnominal modifiers (mainly
anaphoric demonstratives) and serve to express arguments. As discussed in section
3.2.2, many lexical items in Abui are categorically indetermined and can be used
predicatively and referentially. The ambiguity is usually resolved by the syntactic context
in which the item is inserted. The presence of a quantifier or anaphoric demonstrativeNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES153typically indicates a nominal structure. However, also a number of verb phrases are
nominalised and used referentially, as illustrated in (56). They indicate spatial or
temporal locations that are specified by the first constituent. The final constituent of
these forms is always a verb. The first constituent is either a noun, expressing an
argument of the head verb, or another verb.

‘two main beams of the house supported by vertical poles with mouth-like endings’In (57), a number of species are grouped according to their typical habitat. The habitat
(a ‘location’) that expressed with an NP is the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’; it is
referred to by the prefix he- (3II.LOC). Observe that the first constituent is a noun (tei
‘field’, mang ‘possession’, or an NP (ahiling tama ‘air’), or another nominalised VP
(tama wal ‘ocean’).

‘pond’In (63), the nominalised VP da-wa bang (lit.: ‘carry his mouth’) refers to a person that
likes to gossip. This referent is cross-referenced with the possessive prefix da- (3I.INAL)

‘carry’.

It is followed by the noun adua ‘master, boss’ in a possessive-like construction.","[173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"

These include Adang (Haan, 2001), Blagar (Steinhauer, 1991), Kabola (Stokhof, 1987),
Klon (Baird, 2005, in preparation), Kui (Donohue, 1997a), Western Pantar (also
referred to as Lamma) (Holton, 2005; To appear), Sawila/Tanglapui (Donohue, 1997a),
Teiwa (Klamer, In prep.). No linguistic studies have yet been done on Kula, Wersing,
and Retta. There are at least six languages reported in linguistic sources that are not
listed on the map. They are Kaera (Klamer, To appear-b), Kolana (Donohue, 1997b),
Manata, Mauta, Alor Malay (a local variety of the Indonesian lingua franca) and Alorese
(sometimes referred to as Bahasa Alor). Alor Malay and Alorese are spoken mainly in
coastal areas. Alor Malay is being used in many communities to bring up the youngest
generation and is the strongest candidate to become the most commonly used language
in the Alor-Pantar area.","[27, 28]"

arguments displaying some plurality. In transitive construction, distributive pronouns
express or co-index a number of NPs (typically two) that serve as U arguments; they
have a distributive reading. In intransitive construction, distributive prefixes co-index a
number of A arguments acting upon each other (again formally at least two
participants); the distributive pronouns have a reciprocal reading.
In (21), an example of a transitive construction is given. The distributive
pronoun ta- (DISTR.PAT) co-indexes a number of NPs (underscore in the glossing). The
construction has a distributive reading ‘each’ or ‘one by one’. Note that the A argument
of verb bot ‘order’ is expressed with the NP ama ‘person, people’.

"114CHAPTER IIIaddressee. 16 The speaker typically uses the demonstrative nu to refer to specific
information that is present in the context and already known to the addressee.
The use of the anaphoric demonstratives in both domains is illustrated below.
Only the axis SPEAKER-ADDRESSEE and PROXIMAL-DISTAL apply to anaphoric
demonstratives. In (126), the proximal anaphoric demonstratives do (PRX) and to
(PRX.AD) are given.
(126) a. kaai do
dog PRX
‘the dog (I just talked about)’b. kaai to
dog PRX.AD
‘the dog (you just talked about)’The use of the anaphoric demonstratives given in (126) is exemplified in (127). In both
cases, the referent fala ‘house’ expresses an argument of the verb fak ‘break’. In (a), a
neutral case is given. In (b), the referent fala ‘house’ is located as proximate in the
discourse of the addressee. The speaker refers to the house that the addressee talked
about. The demonstrative to is used to draw addressee’s attention.

referent is traditionally considered definite.
In (128), the noun kawen ‘machete’ is followed by the anaphoric demonstrative

a situation in which Waksi makes nice drawings in his book. Simon wants to have a
look at his book, and asks Waksi to lend him his book. Waksi is afraid that Simon will
lose it and tells Simon that he wants to make a copy of his book before Simon may
borrow it. He uses the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) in order to refer to his own
book that Simon talked about.","[136, 137]"

"3588.3CHAPTER VIIIAsymmetrical Serial Verb Constructions type IAsymmetrical SVCs of type I (henceforth ASVC.I) consist of a grammatically restricted
‘minor’ verb(s) that follows an unrestricted ‘major’ verb, as defined in 8.1.2. While the
major verb identifies the event, the minor one has the grammatical function of
expressing aspect, direction, manner,8 or mood of the event identified by the major
verb. The order of the verbs in ASVC.I is fixed and grammaticalized.
The various subtypes of ASVC.I found in this section are discussed according to
the grammatical function of the minor verb: SVCs with minor verbs expressing aspect
are discussed in section 8.3.1. SVCs with minor verbs expressing motion are discussed
in 8.3.2. SVCs with minor verb expressing manner are found in 8.3.3. SVCs with minor
verbs expressing mood can be found in section 8.3.4. One type of ASVC.I is
characterized by the verb-class membership of the minor verb. As discussed in 8.3.5,
the minor verb belongs to the index-verb class. In general, it has a function relating to
manner.","[380, 381]"
"3.5.6Conjunction markersIn Abui, there are a small number of forms that serve as conjunction markers such as
ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), e ‘and’, and re ‘or’. The coordination marker e ‘and’ occurs only in
the nominal domain. As illustrated in (168), the marker e ‘and’ may combine with
nouns referring to humans and inanimate referents.
(168) Boi e

‘Boi and his friends’faling, kaweneSimoneDoriname

machete and whetstone
‘axes, swords and red whetstones’kika
be.redIn coordinating constructions, at least two nouns are conjoined by a conjunction
marker or simply listed with an intonational pause after each of the constituents.
Coordinating constructions must be distinguished from list compounds (see section126CHAPTER III4.3.3). The order of constituents in a list compound is lexicalized, while in case of
coordinating construction this is not the case.
The conjunction markers ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), and re ‘or’ may be used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain. The linker ba (LNK) joins two constituents so that they
have shared reference to a single referent or event. I refer to this linker as ‘intersective’.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) may be used in nominal domain to link an NP to other
constituents (relative clauses, numerals, deictics, other NPs) that serve as adnominal
modifiers. In (169), the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the head noun kaai ‘dog’ with
the modifier NP he-bikeng faring ‘his many lice’. The complex NP serves as the A
argument of the verb kafia ‘scrape, scratch’ and it is co-indexed with the prefix do(3I.REC).
(169) [kaai]NP ba
{he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a

LNK 3II.AL-louse many
DST 3I.REC-scrape-DUR
‘that dog with many lice is scratching (itself) over there’[B05.060.02]In section 4.5, I discuss other structures that are linked with the intersective linker ba
(LNK) to an NP. In the verbal domain, ba (LNK) links two verbs as in (170) the verbs
bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’. The events of ‘carrying’ and ‘going’ refer to a complex event
‘carry towards’.
(170) tafaa di bang ba
yaa
drum 3A carry LNK go
‘he carried drums to the village’melangmi-a-d-ivillagebe.in-be.at-hold-PFV
[B02.118.07:50]The linked verbs form a tight unit that falls under the scope of a negation. This
type of construction is different from serial verb constructions, which are defined as a
verb clusters without any conjunction markers (see 8.1). The use of ba (LNK) in the
verbal domain will not be further analysed in the current description.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) contrasts with the non-intersective linker ya
glossed as SEQ(uential). ya (SEQ) indicates a non-intersective union of two constituents
(a sequence of phrases or clauses). It may be used in both nominal and verbal domain.
In the nominal domain, ya (SEQ) links two NPs. This is illustrated in (171), where two
NPs are linked. Recall (169), to see the contrast with ba (LNK) that can not serve as a
coordinating conjunction marker.

[B05.008.06]GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES127In the verbal domain, ya (SEQ) links verbs that retain their own reference so that the
construction is read as a sequence of events. Example (170) is contrasted with example
(172) below. In (172), the verbs bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’ do not refer to a single event
because the ‘carrying’ preceded the ‘going’.

‘he carried drums and (then) went to the village’In (173), a more complex example is given, where the non-intersective linker ya (SEQ)
marks that the verbs we ‘leave’, tahai ‘search’ and marang ‘go up’ describe successive
events.

[B06.078.00:37]The linker re ‘or’ indicates a disjoint set of constituents. It is often used in alternative
questions, in which two or more possible answers are presented. It is used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain as illustrated in (174).

This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

‘this house is big’PRXDEM]NPQuantifiers are the second right-most adnominal modifiers. In an NP, they are
preceded by stative verbs and adjectives. When quantifiers are not followed by an
anaphoric demonstrative, they signal the end of an NP. As illustrated in (101) the
stative verb foka ‘be big’ must precede the quantifier ayoku ‘two’ in order to be
interpreted as an adnominal modifier (b). When the stative verb foka ‘be big’ follows
the numeral, it is interpreted as a VP head (a).

verbs that are not interpreted as adnominal modifiers but as VP heads. In (b), these
stative verbs are embedded in the NP with the linker ba (LNK) that is discussed in the
following section.

structures, the linker ba (LNK) links the NP with a modifier constituent. Linked
modifiers come in a variety ranging from NPs, adnominal modifiers such as stative
verbs, quantifiers, demonstratives, to relative clauses and adverbs. In case of relative
clauses, the relativized NP is usually not expressed inside the relative clause (it is
gapped), unless it is a U argument that has to be obligatorily expressed with a
pronominal prefix. In (104), the linked modifier of the bare NP kaai ‘dog’ is the NP
bikeng faring ‘many fleas’.

NP moku fila ‘little child’ is linked with ba (LNK) to the modifier NP pikai kira

refers to the fable character Sharp Butt. The modified NP is referred to with the
alienable possessive prefix he- (3II.AL). In the fable, Sharp Butt and Sharp Head venture
to steal coconuts but lacking savvy and solidarity, both die at the end.

demonstrative nu (SPC.AD). The NP headed by fala ‘house’ contains also the numeral
nuku ‘one’. The complex structure expresses the U argument of the verb tukai
‘support’.","[190, 191, 192]"
"GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES69From the presented data, we can construct a number of morphological
templates of Abui words. They are listed in (4) and represent the possible
morphological structures of Abui words. Abui words consist minimally of a free root
(i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes, either prefixes (ii) or suffixes
(iii), or with both (iv). They may form a complex stem with a bound root and be
combined with affixes (v). There are also bound roots. To form a word, bound roots
obligatorily combine with prefixes (vi), suffixes (vii) or other bound roots (viii).

word. Generally, free roots, illustrated in (i), are found in all grammatical categories.
Free and bound roots that combine with pronominal prefixes (ii, vi) are either nouns or
verbs. Only verbal roots combine with both pronominal prefixes and aspectual suffixes
(iii, iv, vii). Stems that consist of two roots, of which one is bound, are interpreted as
verbs.
In Abui, verb stems may display stem alternation. This is illustrated in (5), where
a number of stems show an alternation in their rime. The alternation affects either the
coda, as illustrated in the first and second row, or the nucleus, as illustrated in third row
where no coda is present.

scoop.CPLThe stem alternation encodes aspectual properties of the referred event. The
completive stems (CPL) refer to an event that has a final point. The inceptive stems (ICP)
choose the opposite perspective; they refer to an event that has an initial point. The70CHAPTER IIIstem alternation is a typical morphological characteristic of the verbal category. It is
discussed in detail in sections 3.4.2.3 and 6.1.1.1 as an aspect marking device.
In Abui, a number of bound roots cliticize to free forms to form a prosodic
word. They are aspectual particles te (INCP.C), se (INCP.I), si (PHSL.I), and ti (PHSL.C), and
the bound root ng ‘see’. As illustrated in (6), these forms can be characterized as
enclitics, as they are always attached to the preceding prosodic word.

[B04.019.01]NounsSemantic propertiesThe grammatical category of nouns contains items that refer to time-stable concepts:
persons, objects, places, and substances (cf. Payne, 1997:33; Schachter, 1985:7; Anward
et al., 1997:173). In Abui, the words given in (7) are identified as nouns, as they share
these semantic properties.

semantic as many items that are in some contexts identified as nouns (typically with
non-human referent) may also refer to events. Instead, the grammatical category of
nouns is identified by its distributional properties (see section 3.2.3).","[91, 92, 93]"

"2.5.4Stress and toneIn a relatively small number of monosyllabic and disyllabic words, the stress pattern
results into differentiation of the pitch contour which is lexicalized. There are a number
of words that have lexical tone. Although yet underdocumented from the Timor-AlorPantar area, Abui is clearly a language with lexical tone. For the Takalelang dialect,
words with lexical tone were recorded in an experiment, where they were randomly
mixed with other words without lexicalized pitch contour. The syntactic position of all
recorded words was kept constant to minimize interference of the clausal pitch
contour. In orthography, the high tone is marked with the acute accent diacritic on the
vowel; the low tone is marked with the grave accent diacritic as illustrated in (91).",[81]
"1.4Linguistic situationAbui is spoken in a linguistically diverse area where Austronesian and Papuan languages
are spoken. The Alor-Pantar area comprises approximately twenty five languages of
which only a number have been studied and documented. Map 2 shows both Papuan
and Austronesian languages spoken in the Alor-Pantar area. The immediate neighbours
of Abui are Kamang, Kui, Hamap, Klon, Kafoa, and Kabola. The map does not
mention Alor Malay, which has an increasing number of speakers in the area. The Abui
community is relatively large (16,000 speakers) compared to other ethnic groups in
Alor-Pantar area. Abui is reported to be the target of language shift in some of its
neighbouring languages such as Kafoa or Hamap (Katubi 2004).
In the recent past, a large number of settlements (practically all larger villages
such as Takalelang, Fanating, or Mainang) have been moved down from their
mountainous habitat either to the coast or to valleys. As a result of the resettlement,
many settlements are now located near markets, roads, or the sea where they have more
contact with other language communities. These factors stimulate the language shift of
the youngest generation towards Malay. The northern and western settlements such as
Takalelang, Welai, Fanating and Moru are most affected by the shift while small
mountainous settlements are least affected. In Takalelang, most children are brought up
in Malay, though they become more proficient in Abui when they grow up because it is
still the main language used between adults.
The situation is different in small settlements such as Tifol Afeng, where I
conducted a part of my fieldwork. Here, people are fluent in Malay, but in their daily
lives Abui is the main language and is used in communication with children. Children
remain monolingual in Abui until the age of five or six, the age at which they start
going to school.
In churches, the situation varies. In Takalelang, the protestant church uses
exclusively Indonesian; the catholic community uses the Indonesian liturgy. Abui is
used in parish council meetings and in worship where the priest is not present, such as
in Rosary worship that takes place in the houses of parish members. The first attempt
to translate the Gospel in Abui has been made by the late Julius Onkari Manimabi. It
resulted in a typescript of the first chapter of the Gospel according to Mark which is
included in the corpus.
In schools, Abui is banned. Despite official policy stimulating bilingual
education in Indonesia, in Alor education is monolingual and many teachers are
unaware of the official policy. To my knowledge, instruction materials in Abui have not
been made available or developed up to this day.
In the market, members of various Alorese ethnic groups address each other
using each other’s native terms, which is considered very good manners. Abui speakers
are identified by their pronunciation of the sound [k], which is pronounced as the
uvular stop [q] in word-internal and word-final positions.",[27]

usually a stative verb in (a, b). The structures in (a, b) have a restrictive reading.
Consider also the distinction between (b) and (c). While (b) refers to a person that is
bad because of his deeds, (c) has an open reading and refers to a ‘bad guy’, i.e. a person
who does not necessarily do anything bad, but has a potential to do so.

ba (LNK) is obligatory when the following verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’ is to be
interpreted as a modifier (a). The intersective linker ba (LNK) follows the modifier
palata ‘be cold’ and introduces a relative clause. In (b) and (c), the intersective linker ba
(LNK) is not present; consequently, both constructions have a different reading. In (c),
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) follows the verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’. The
demonstrative is not interpreted as an adnominal modifier because the verb dakun-i
‘become dirty’ is not embedded but predicates over the NP ya palata ‘cold water’. For
the clause level functions of anaphoric demonstratives see section 6.4.3.

meting ‘betel nut and betel vine’ is logically the U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ but in

structure, the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the bare NP kafiei ‘goat’ with the relative
clause nai-d-i nu ‘became lost (some time ago)’. Note that the head noun kafiei ‘goat’ is
the single argument of the verb nai-d- ‘get lost’.

[B07.013.01]In (113), the bare NP fe ‘pig’ combines with a relative clause. Observe that the head
noun fe ‘pig’ is co-indexed as the possessor of the noun toku ‘leg’ in the relative clause.
The noun toku ‘leg’ serves as the U argument of the verb kor ‘bind’. The A argument
of the verb kor ‘bind’ is not expressed. Note that the relativized NP fe ‘pig’ is coindexed with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL) and PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) inside the

former village head’. This NP is linked with a large relative clause given between curly172CHAPTER IVbrackets. The example comes from a conversation concerning the place name Fota
Ailol. The name refers to a place with a large wide stone that used to be a resting place
in the old days. The speaker described the stone as being located with respect to the
house of the addressee’s uncle. He refers to the house as standing below a big and wide

[B02.127.01:35]From the previous examples, we can conclude that the linker ba (LNK) links an NP and
a modifier in a structure that functions as single NP. In fact, this definition can be
expanded also to the clause level, as the linker ba (LNK) serves to link verbs in a single
clause (see also section 3.5.6). The linked ba (LNK) has an intersective function; it links
two constituents to a single unit on the level of one of them.
In the complex NPs given so far, the NP precedes the linker ba (LNK) linking it
with a modifier constituent (adnominal modifier or a clause). The modified NP may be
considered as the head of the construction. However, in some cases, the modifying
constituent precedes the noun or the noun may be omitted. The modifier constituent
has either deictic or possessive function and its location corresponds to the location of
deictics and possessors within the NP. In (116), the relative clause nopa mia ‘be
touching on me’ precedes the NP bataa do ‘the wood’. The linker ba (LNK) follows the
clause. In (b), the expected constituent order is given which is also attested.

function is deictic; its structure is parallel to that of an NP. As discussed above, deictic
modifiers precede the head noun in the NP.

ama ‘person’ is not expressed but its expected position is marked with ∅ following the
relative clause. Because the head is not expressed intersective linker ba (LNK) follows
the quantifier loku (PL). The complex NP serves as argument for the index verb n-u ‘be

[B06.038.05:20]In (119), a complex construction is given where an NP headed by the noun he-kalieta
‘old person’ combines with the noun Kafola that expresses the possessor of the noun
kalieta ‘old person’ referring to the area where the old person comes from. It precedes
the NP and is linked with ba (LNK). The NP contains an embedded relative clause
marked with curly brackets. The evidence that this relative clause is embedded comes
from the position of the numeral nuku ‘one’, which follows the relative clause but
quantifies the noun kalieta ‘old person’. The relative clause he-tafaa do ayoku fala mi-a
‘his two drums are in the house’ is not linked to the head kalieta ‘old person’ with the
linker ba (LNK) as expected. One possibility is that it is omitted in the fast speech (this is
a fragment of a conversation); another possibility is that the possessive prefix he(3II.AL) that links the noun tafaa ‘drum’ to the possessor kalieta ‘old person’ is
sufficient.

[B06.041.10:49]In (120), the relative clause el adat he-ì is linked with ba (LNK) to the NP nala nu ‘those
things’. The relative clause precedes the NP because it expresses a possessor. The verb ì
‘put’ is often used in Abui to express possession (see also 8.4.2.7).

‘you should agree on those!’[B13.012.38:14]However, when the possessor expressed in the relative clause is inanimate, the relative
clause is not fronted. This is illustrated in (121), where the relative clause mi=ng tanga
he-ì do follows the NP nala ‘something’. This structure describes a mobile phone as a
thing that one uses for speaking (with other people).

‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’[B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).

there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example ofNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES175nominal predication is given in (123). In (a), the bare NP kalieta ‘old person’ serves as
nominal predicate. In (b), the NP moku fila ‘small child’ predicates over Fan Malei.

This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal
predicate with the NP Simon ayoku ‘two Simons’. The construction is contrasted with
nominal predicative construction in (b).

index verb wi-d- ‘be like.MD’ usually follows both NPs. This is illustrated in (128),176CHAPTER IVwhere the NPs Jakarta do ‘Jakarta’ and Takalelang fila ‘small Takalelang’ precede the

In this chapter, I discuss Abui argument realization. Event participants are realized as
different arguments of a verb with NPs and/or pronouns. The choice of the
appropriate realization is determined by the semantic properties of the participant. This
is discussed in section 5.1. The controlling and volitional participants are identified for
the actor (A) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or free pronouns. The affected
participants are identified for the undergoer (U) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or
bound pronouns. The listed criteria apply to arguments in both transitive and
intransitive constructions.
The choice between a pronoun and an NP is determined by the referential
properties of the participant. In section 5.2, I show that arguments with a specific
reference are expressed with pronouns and optional NPs; arguments with a nonspecific reference are expressed with NPs. In section 5.3, I discuss the A arguments
that are expressed with free pronouns. In section 5.4, the U arguments expressed with
bound pronouns are described. There are three distinct sets of bound pronouns that
may express the U arguments. As discussed in section 5.5, the choice of a bound
pronoun is determined by the semantic properties of the participants such as
[±individuated] and [±change of state]. In section 5.6, I focus on the U argument in
transitive constructions. I illustrate multiple ways in which the U argument can be
expressed. In section 5.7, the argument realization in intransitive constructions is
discussed. The single participant of the intransitive verb may be realized as the A or U
argument. In section 5.8, I present a diachronic analysis of the bound pronouns.
Finally, in section 5.9 an overview of the argument realization is given.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"
"1.3Abui communityThe term ‘Abui’ is an Abui word that means ‘mountains’ or alternatively ‘enclosed
place’. This term is also used in local Malay to refer to Abui speakers who refer to their
language as Abui tanga ‘mountain language’ and to themselves as Abui loku ‘the
mountain people’. In Abui oral tradition (cf. Nicolspeyer, 1940; Djeki, 1986, my own
records) Abui people settled in Alor in ancient times and did not find other settlers
there. Later some of them moved to the Kabola peninsula. The same tradition accounts
that they dwelled in caves in the mountains in the Mainang area. In this area also some
rock art is found. They refer to neighbouring tribes as ‘younger siblings’ or as ‘new
arrivals’. However, the oral tradition in Alor serves too often as a political instrument.
The oral tradition has not been verified by archaeological research yet.
Abui speakers are mainly farmers, just like other inhabitants of Alor. However,
in mountainous areas hunting and gathering is also an important supplement to the
staple diet of corn, cassava, and rice.3 In the coastal areas, which are less favourable for
agriculture, many farmers have switched to fishing, the traditional activity of the
Austronesian population. Traditional livestock are pigs and chicken. However, livestock
seldom supplement the diet due to frequent swine fever and poultry diseases. Thus, the
diet is not well balanced, often resulting in poor health conditions and anaemia,
especially among children and women. In the mountainous areas the situation is better
as traditional hunting provides a more balanced diet. The mountains also favour a
number of important cash crops such as coconuts, coffee, cloves, cocoa, cashew nuts,
candle nuts, vanilla and tobacco. These provide the farmers with additional income,
which results in generally better living standards than for people in the coastal areas.
Educational facilities in the Abui area are limited to elementary and secondary
schools in district capitals. The nearest university is in Kalabahi, which offers limited
training in economy, law, English and computer science. The more significant
educational institutions are found in Kupang, the provincial capital of NTT.
In the interbellum period, the Abui community was studied by scholars Cora
Du Bois and Martha M. Nicolspeyer. Cora Du Bois was a psychologist who spent two
years in Ateng Melang (a.k.a. Atimelang), carrying out psychological research focussing
mainly on the personality structure of Abui people and the relationship between
personality and culture. She is considered to be one of the founding scholars of this
subject, together with Sigmund Freud, Edward Sapir, Abram Kardiner and others. The
research that Du Bois carried out among Abui people resulted in the monumental
monograph The People of Alor (Du Bois, 1944; 1960). Du Bois’ colleague, Martha M.
Nicolspeyer, accompanied Du Bois during her research in Ateng Melang and published
a dissertation about the sociological structure of Abui society (Nicolspeyer, 1940).
3Source: Sensus 20024CHAPTER INicolspeyer attached to her dissertation a corpus of texts in the Ateng Melang dialect.
These texts were recorded jointly with Du Bois; they are glossed in Dutch and a Dutch
translation is provided together with a word list. Although Nicolspeyer’s corpus is
included in the corpus for my research I do not refer to it in this grammar because the
present work describes the Takalelang dialect.","[26, 27]"

However, it is impossible to analyse all of them as regularly derived compounds: the
semantic contribution of their head (the final generic) is elusive, and it is difficult toCOMPLEX VERBS329relate it to how it is used in other paradigms. In other words, the overall morphological
function of particular generic verbs can only be spotted by comparing their function
across various sets of paradigms (cf. the sets discussed above, and the ones to be
discussed in the sections below). But even then, the patterns are not always regular and
semantically transparent, and there are many paradigms with lexical gaps.
Other generic roots are used with very low frequency in the final position. The
generic root f ‘sever’ encodes events of separation such as ‘steal’, as illustrated in (34),
k-o-f- ‘cut off’ that alternates with k-o-i ‘cut’ illustrated in (87), or -yong-f- ‘forget’. In
(92), the order of the generic roots is reversed. Interestingly, also the semantics of the
CV is reversed. The CV t-e-k refers to downwards motion of ‘sliding’. The CV k-e-t
refers to the upwards motion of ‘prodding’.

as ‘lying down’. The verb refers to the ‘cutting’ and ‘rolling down’ of the weed in the
garden. In this way the garden is cleaned, the weed is consequently burden, and new
crop planted.

‘I go to work in my garden’, lit.: ‘I go to make lay (the weed in) my garden’ [B01.035.32]In (94), the completive CV t-e-t refers to a similar event. The ‘stone wall’ kota collapsed
during an earthquake and slid on a man. The person buried under the stones is realized
with an NP ama kang nuku ‘one man’ and co-indexed as the recipient/goal with the
pronominal prefix ho- (3II.REC). Because the event is completed already the CV stem is
followed by the perfective suffix -i (PFV). The original final root k ‘bring’ is replaced by
the root t ‘lie’.

[B05.078.01]In (95), a contrastive example is given. The CV k-e-k refers to an event oriented away
from DC. The CV combines with two arguments, the A argument is realized with the
free pronoun di (3A); the U argument is realized with the NP baleei wataka do ‘the
banana blossom’. The referred event is a motion towards a ‘banana blossom’ that is
best translated as ‘prodding to’. It is the reversed motion from ‘sliding’ or ‘rolling
down’.","[351, 352]"

(84). The verb ong ‘make’ combines with the complex verb nai-d-i ‘become lost’. This
part of the serial verb construction serves as a complement for the verb ma ‘be.PRX’
and in the next step also for the verb re ‘reach’ which are joined in a SVC expressing a
hypothetical condition.

belongs to the generic-verb class (see 3.4.5.2) such as ng ‘see’, d ‘get, hold’, m ‘take, be
in’, l ‘give’, k ‘bring’, p ‘touch’, and ì ‘put’. 14 The function of the minor verb is to
express or specify a participant. The arguments of the minor verbs refer to
benefactives, instruments, recipients, locations etcetera. I discuss the functions of the
minor verbs in the following order: ng ‘see’ (8.4.2.1), d ‘hold, get’ (8.4.2.2), m ‘take, be
in’ (8.4.2.3), l ‘give’ (8.4.2.4), k ‘bring’ (8.4.2.5), p ‘touch’ (8.4.2.6), and ì ‘put’ in (8.4.2.7).
8.4.2.1
SVC with ng ‘see’
The generic verb ng ‘see’ occurs as a minor verb in SVCs encoding three related
grammatical functions. (i) In allative SVCs it expresses the goal location of a movement
or activity. (ii) In purpose SVCs it serves to express the purpose of an activity. It is, in
fact, expressed in the same way as the goal location in time, with the difference that
‘purpose’ is encoded as a specific argument with the LOC prefix as the U argument of
the minor verb ng ‘see’. (iii) The third function is different. The SVC is used to express
an experiencer. The ‘experiencer’ component is contributed by the semantics of the
minor verb ng ‘see’. The A argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ expresses the nonvolitional actor of the whole construction. These three functions are discussed in turn
below:
14 The monosegmental roots such as ng ‘see’, d ‘hold, get’ etc. are identified as verbs in Abui, because carry
aspectual and person inflection and have the ability to derive new verbs from non-verbal roots, as discussed
in chapter 7. Cross-linguistically, adpositions inflecting for person are not found frequently, a know example
is Irish (cf. Noonan 2001; 2004). However, the other properties of the Abui roots indicate their verbhood.","[398, 399]"
"10 The term ‘involuntary experience construction’ is borrowed from Pawley (2006). It refers to a number of
transitive constructions found across TNG languages. In these constructions ‘one participant is an
experiencer which is encoded as direct object. The other denotes a bodily or mental condition or process that
affects the experiencer’ (cf. Pawley, 2006:2).",[271]
"3.2.4Relation between semantic and distributional properties of nounsIn Abui, semantic properties of nouns, such as animacy or individuation, are in relation
to their distributional properties. In general, actors are animate. They are realized with
NPs and co-indexed with the free pronoun di (3A). This is illustrated in (19) where the
NP naana ‘older sibling’ combines with di.
(19)naanadi na-welolder.sibling 3A 1SG.PAT-pour
‘my older sibling bathes me’[B01.032.08]Inanimate referents may be identified as a force and realized as the A argument of a
verb. As illustrated in (20), the force timoi foka ‘big wind’ is co-indexed with the
pronoun di (3A) as the A argument of the verb -lák ‘break’. Note that the free pronoun
di (3A) combines exclusively with A arguments.
(20)timoi fokadi likfalaha-lákwind
be.big 3A platform house 3II.PAT-break
‘the big wind broke the house and verandah’[B06.011.02]Both animate and inanimate participants may be identified as undergoers. In general,
animate and human undergoer participants are realized in more complex constructions
than inanimate undergoer participants. This is illustrated in (21) where the verb bol ‘hit’
combines in (a) with an inanimate undergoer realized as the NP wó kanai do ‘the canariGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES75nuts up there’. In (b), the verb bol ‘hit’ combines with a human undergoer Arjun. This
participant is identified as a benefactive and expressed as the U argument of the verb l
‘give’ and co-indexed with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC). The verb l ‘give’ is
grammaticalized to encode benefactive participants.

literature (cf. Gentner and Boroditsky 2001) that nouns differ in their ontological status
ranging from prototypical objects such as ‘man’ to prototypical substances such as
‘water’. This scale is referred to as ‘Individuation Continuum’ (cf. Gentner and
Boroditsky 2001:230). Prototypical objects in languages such as ‘man’ or ‘father’ are
individuated. Prototypical substances such as ‘water’ or ‘wood’ are not individuated. In
Abui, the feature [±individuated] is manifested in the asymmetrical use of the quantifier
loku (PL). 3 The quantifier indicates a plural number of individuated referents. It is
ungrammatical to use the quantifier loku with typical mass nouns such as bataa ‘wood’.
This is illustrated in (22).
(22)a. bataab. *bataa lokuwood
‘wood, forest, trees’woodPLThe quantifier loku may not be used with nouns referring to small animals, typically
occurring in large groups such as fikai ‘ant sp.’; this identifies them as mass nouns.
(23)a. felokupig PL

contribute the feature [+individuated] and can make nouns such as bataa ‘wood, forest,
trees’ countable. Another related strategy is the use of a modifier noun such as tuku
‘piece’. The semantics of the noun tuku ‘piece’ describes the shape of the substance
and helps to conceptualize it as a [+individuated] object. This is illustrated in (24).","[97, 98]"
"2SG must go
‘you must go’[B05.065.04]Some more ambiguous lexical items are listed in (11)-(14). There is a semantic
relation between their two meanings in the sense that the noun refers to a U argument
of the verb in a very broad sense. The semantic relations may be described in pairs such
as undergoer/result-activity, instrument-activity, location-activity, and entity-property

an NP) or predicatively (as the head of a VP). The same categorial ambiguity is found
also by lexical items that are borrowed from Malay, as illustrated in (15). The two uses
of sakola display the location-activity relationship; tulusa displays the undergoeractivity relationship:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES(15)a. sakola73b. tulusa‘school/school, teach’‘writing/write’As exemplified above, ambiguous items are identified as either noun or verb by
the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.13.2.3Distributional propertiesAt the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):
(16)ne-feela‘my friend’1SG.AL-friendhe-maama‘his father’3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)
below. As illustrated in (17), the bound roots –táng ‘hand’ and wei ‘ear’ combine with
pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.
(17)na-táng
1SG.INAL-hand‘my hand’ha-wei‘his ear’3II.INAL-earThere is a distinction between the nouns in (16) and (17). The nouns in (17) obligatorily
combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction
1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)
Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuan
languages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.","[94, 95, 96]"

In this chapter, I give an overview of Abui phonology. In other words, I discuss the
different sounds of the language and how they are combined together. The data
presented in this chapter are from the Takalelang, Alila and Tifol Afeng dialect. In a
small number of cases, data from the Fanating dialect are used. These cases are
explicitly marked.
This chapter is organized as follows: in section 2.1.1, the phonemic inventory of
Abui is discussed. The distribution of the phonemes within words and syllables are
described in 2.2, with subsections for consonants (2.2.1) and vowels (2.2.2). Syllable
structure is described in 2.3 and further referred to in 2.4 where I give an overview of
prosodic word types. In a prosodic word, syllables are stressed following the iambic
pattern (2.5); a penultimate heavy syllable causes the final syllable to be extrametrical
(2.5.3). A small number of Abui word has lexical tone (2.5.4). This chapter ends in 2.6
with an overview of orthographic conventions used in this grammar.","[46, 47, 48]"
"1SG.LOC-hold-IPFV go.up.CNT take-DUR
‘friend, will you go up to take it or me, I go up to take (it)’[B06.050.00:48]In Abui, focus is primarily encoded by fronting to the left-periphery of the
clause.16 This position is marked by an pause in intonation that follows the focussed
constituent. This pragmatic structure may interact with the focus SVC. The minor verb
and its U argument are extracted from the core of the clause (realized as contiguous
SVC) and placed in the clause-initial pragmatic position. An NP can be extracted to the
focus position without leaving any pronominal trace. This is illustrated in (117) where
the NP kawen ‘machete’ occurs clause-initially.

focus pronoun, just like the form ne-d-e. The pause in intonation between nedo and na
in (118) may be used as evidence supporting such an analysis.17 In my analysis, I choose
The left edge of the clause is a typical location of focussed constituent also in other Papuan languages, as
argued by Donohue (2005:187).
17 In fact, a similar construction occurs in the neighbouring language Kabola (cf. Stokhof: 1987:647) where a
pronoun combined with a morpheme -ri, which is analyzed as a case marker, may be fronted to a pragmatic
position as illustrated in (2). Interestingly, the morpheme -ri may be combined with the inceptive aspectual
marker so.

form ne-d-o as a verb phrase that appears in the clause-initial pragmatic position. As
illustrated in (119), the pragmatic position has a nominalising effect on the verb phrase
occurring in it. The pragmatic position marks any constituent appearing in it as given.
The resulting nominal ne-d-o has a lot in common with pronouns. The pragmatic
position does not allow free pronouns, which cannot be extracted from the clause.

demonstrative do (PRX), as illustrated in (121). Anaphoric demonstratives do not
combine with pronominal prefixes, unlike nouns, verbs and numerals.18

SVC with m ‘take, be in’
The generic verb m is glossed either as ‘take’ or ‘be in’ depending on the grammatical
context in which it is used. The decisive factors are the type and animacy value of its
arguments. In contexts where the minor verb combines with an animate A argument it
is glossed as ‘take’, in other contexts as ‘be in’.","[409, 410]"
"8.4.1Causative SVC with ong ‘make’In causative SVCs, the minor verb ong ‘make’ introduces an A argument referring to
the acting participant. Consider the causative SVC given in (80) consisting of the verbs
ong ‘make’ and moni ‘die’. The verb moni ‘die’ typically occurs in intransitive
constructions (see examples (60)-(63) in section 6.1.2.1). A causative SVC is required to
introduce an acting participant involved in the event of ‘dying’. The U argument de-ura
‘his sister’ is shared by both verbs. The major verb remains intransitive and indicates
the resultant state of participant realized as the U argument of the verb ong ‘make’.
(80)di de-uraongmon-i3A 3I.AL-sibling.OS make die.CPL-PFV
‘he killed his sister’, lit.: ‘he made his sister die’[B05.071.02]The causative SVC with ong ‘make’ is used with verbs that refer to events that do not
include acting and volitional human participants such as ‘die’. Note that a similar event
can be expressed with a transitive construction, such as in (81) using the verb fen
‘injure, kill’ that commonly occurs in transitive construction:
(81)dide-urafen-i3A
3I.AL-sibling.OS injure.CPL-PFV
‘he killed his sister, lit.: he injured his sister (with intention to kill)’[B05.071.02]Another verb that does not combine with acting human participant is fak ‘break’. In
(82), it occurs in a causative SVC combining with ong ‘make’. Both verbs share the U
argument bataa ‘wood, tree’. The intransitive verb fak ‘break’ requires the support of
ong ‘make’ in order to express the acting force ahana beka ‘storm’ realized as the A
argument of ong ‘make’.

"Note that for some Abui kinship terms are relative to the ego and gender of the possessor. The form ura
refers to a sibling of the opposite gender than the possessor. The form muknehi refers to a sibling of the same
gender as the possessor. For the terms naana ‘older sibling’ and nahaa ‘younger sibling’ the age of the
possessor is relevant.

Abui deictic demonstratives
Abui deictic precede the head constituent and indicate the spatial location of the head
constituent. As in other domains of Abui grammar, the demonstratives are organized
along the relative frame of reference based in either speaker or addressee. The
horizontal distance from the deictic centre is categorized by the axis
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. The vertical location is specified only for medial and distal
referents. As illustrated in (122), the noun sura ‘book’ combines with proximal deictic
demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). Following Levinson (2003), these deictic
demonstratives refer to the proximate location of a figure (F) with respect of the
viewpoint (V). In (a), the viewpoint is located at the speaker, while in (b); it is located at
the addressee. Often the addressee based demonstrative is used to draw addressee
attention. Mostly, the speaker based demonstrative is used.

Levinson 2003:43-47). They refer to a location with alternating viewpoint (V) over
speaker or addressee (cf. Levinson 2003:24-61).
The second axis of Abui deictic systems is a horizontal axis that measures the
distance of F from the ground (G). As illustrated in (123), a nearby horizontal distance
of F is expressed with the deictic demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). I refer to
these deictic demonstratives as ‘proximal’. A distant position of F with respect to G is
indicated with the deictic demonstratives o (MD) and yo (MD.AD) that alternate V over
the speaker and the addressee. In (e), the far distance of F, further than the previous
one, is expressed with the deictic oro (DST). In the distal position the alternation of V
does not apply.

apply to proximate positions and is absolute (V cannot be alternated). The deictic
demonstratives in (124) refer to vertically oriented positions of F. Medial (less
proximate) positions are expressed with the low medial deictic ò (MD.L) and high medial
deictic ó (MD.H); distal positions are referred to with the low distal deictic wò (DST.L)
and high distal deictic wó (DST.H). The suprasegmental features of a deictic form112CHAPTER IIIindicate either high or low position: the high tone indicates the high position, while the

vowel /ɔ/. In spoken language, they are usually accompanied by a pointing gesture. The
pointing can be done by index finger, lips, eye movement, or chin. Note that the
relative frame of reference is neutralized in the distal position. The forms to and lo may
be related to the deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ and la ‘be.MD’ discussed in 3.4.5.3.
Deictic demonstratives occur in nominal and verbal domains indicating the
location of the referent or event respectively. This is illustrated in (125), where in the
deictic wò (DST.L) combines with the noun fala ‘house’ in (a), and with the verb sei
‘come down’ in (b). In (a), it indicates that the house is located below. In (b), the deictic
wò (DST.L) does not indicate the location of the referent he-aduo ‘his owner’ but refers
to the location of the event of ‘coming down’.

Note that the distal demonstratives based in speaker are neutrally pronounced with the mid tone. In case

"324CHAPTER VIIFor example, in the tripartite derivations, the verbs h, k, l/r, ng/n, p, t, and i frequently
occur as final root, while l/r, d, ng and i are typically used as final root in larger
derivations or in heterogeneous verbs, and f and b have an overall low frequency. The
verb u is used most often in non-final position, in final position it is ambiguous with
the perfect suffix -u (PFV). The verbs s and m are typically used as initial verbs and
occur rarely as final roots.
In (74), I demonstrated that the generic root k ‘bring’ can derive other CV stem
from the CV t-a ‘be on, lie’. In (77), the full set of CVs derived from the CV t-a ‘be on,
lie’ is repeated:
(77)t-a-i‘put on’t-a-h-t-a-k
‘bring down, shoot, empty’

lie-be.at-bring
‘release, let drop on’lie-be.at-seeNote that the derived CVs in (77) cover a wide range of meanings. Some of these
meanings will be exemplified in (78)-(86). In (78), the use of the CV t-a-i is illustrated.
In (a), t-a-i is interpreted as ‘to put x down’, in (b), it refers to curing a person by
‘putting on’ medicine, while in (c), it is used to express an order as something (a duty)
that the old woman ‘imposes on’ the child.

[B02.017.09:35]The final generic verb i ‘put’ alternates with the verb h ‘lack’ when the event of ‘putting

‘put.on.CPL’. In (79), the verb t-a-h- is exemplified. In (a) t-a-h- is interpreted as
‘already put x down’. In (b), it is interpreted as ‘x being put down on y’ where the y
argument is expressed with the noun pelang ‘canoe’ The x argument is understood as
the second person.

[B02.097.16:21]In the verb t-a-k, the verb k ‘bring’ derives a verb indicating a motion event, which
causes the participant(s) to ‘lie down’. Depending on the context in which the verb is
used, it may get various interpretations, including ‘to shoot x’, ‘to cover x’ or ‘to empty
x’. In (80), the CV t-a-k is used to refer to the ‘bringing down’ of birds and has here the
reading of ‘shooting’. The CV combines with two arguments. The A argument is
realized with the NP Arjun. The U argument is expressed with the NP kuya ‘bird’ coindexed as patient with the prefix ha- (3II.PAT)

[B06.014.03]Interestingly, when the event of ‘shooting’ was completed, the final root k ‘bring’
alternates with the root p ‘touch’ as illustrated in (81).

‘her foster child was shooting birds along the way coming down there’ [B02.104.20:08]The final verb is not alternated for the other meanings of the CV t-a-k. In (82), the CV
t-a-k refers to ‘covering’ of one’s head with a piece of cloth, thus being a possible
interpretation of ‘to bring x to lie on y’ where the x argument is expressed as the U
argument of the verb mi ‘take’.

[B02.169.08:43]Another use of the CV t-a-k is given in (83). The verb refers to ‘stopping’ of the
speaker to prevent him to step on a snake. The interpretation ‘to bring y to lie’ is
translated as ‘stop, prevent, interrupt’.

This is illustrated in (84)-(85). In (84), the verb t-a-l refers to sewing of tobacco.","[346, 347, 348]"

divided into three formally distinct sets. Pronominal prefixes are polysemous. They
combine with verbs to express the Undergoer (U) arguments and with nouns to express
possessors.4
Pronominal prefixes from all three sets combine with verbs to express or coindex the Undergoer (U) arguments. The U arguments identified as LOC (location) are
expressed with set I, REC (recipient) with set II, and PAT (patient) with set III (for more
details, see section 5.5). Pronominal prefixes from sets I and III combine also with
nouns. They express or co-index possessors (see 4.2). The prefixes from set III serve to
express possessor in inalienable possessive relations (INAL), set I is used to express
possessor in alienable possessive relations (AL). The prefixes from set I are
polysemous, they refer to locations and possessors. In fact, possessors are encoded as a
‘location’ of the possessed entity.5 An inalienably possessed body part is marked in the
same way as a PAT(ient) argument because both are fully controlled by the POSSESSOR
Polysemous pronominal prefixes used in both nominal and verbal domain are found in other related Alor
Pantar languages such as Teiwa (Klamer and Kratochvíl, 2006; Klamer, In prep.), and Adang (cf. Haan
2001:38, 46). Steltenpool and Stap (1959) report polysemous prefixes for Ekari (referred to as Kapauku), a
language from the Wissel Lakes-Kemandoga group of the TNG family. They observe a similarity between
possessor marking on body parts and kinship terms and the object marking: ‘considering the extremely
passive nature of the acquisition of such ‘possession’ it is not a coincidence that these prefixes are reminiscent
of the passive voice’ (Steltenpool and Stap, 1958:20, translation F.K.).
5 Polysemous pronominal possessor and benefactive markers are also found in Lower Grand Valley Dani
(Bromley 1981:190). Lichtenberk (2002) and Margetts (2004) argue for possessive-benefactive polysemy in
broader cross-linguistic perspective.

DISTRte-to-ta-In the table, prefixes are organized according to their reference. The egophoric prefixes,
referring to the speech act participants are listed first. In egophoric plural forms there is
no distinction between sets I and III; while set II displays free alternation in plural
forms (1PL.I and 2PL). The allophoric prefixes refer to other than the speech act
participants. In allophoric reference, two subtypes are distinguished: 3I and 3II. The 3I
prefixes share the same referent with the A argument within the same domain. The 3II
prefixes do not share the same referent with the A argument within that domain.
The referential domain of allophoric and distributive prefixes is maximally a clause. In
complex structures with the intersective linker ba (LNK) as illustrated in (28), the 3I
prefix refers to the nearest NP within the structure. In this case, the 3I possessive prefix
de- (3I.AL) co-indexes the NP Timo as possessor and the A argument of the verb on
‘make’.
