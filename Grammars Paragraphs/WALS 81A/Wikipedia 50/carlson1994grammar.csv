"7.1. Basic word order in simple clauses
The three basic types of simple clause all share in common the constituent
order subject—predicate. The subject in Supyire is typical from a cross-linguistic point of view, and has the most common subject properties noted in
Hopper and Thompson (1980). From a pragmatic point of view, it is the unmarked topic of the clause (see Giv6n 1984: 139). From a semantic point of
view, it is for the most part the participant which is highest on the scales of
animacy and control. From a syntactic point of view, apart from the obvious
word order criterion (which in the context of this section would be a circular
identification), it is the noun phrase which controls reflexivization (chapter
10, section 10.4), ""equi-NP"" deletion in complements of modality verbs (see
chapter 11, section 11.2), switch reference (see chapter 15, section 15.3),
and the ""logophoric"" alternation between anaphoric and emphatic pronouns
in complements of verbs of speech (see chapter 11, section 11.5.1). All these
are typical syntactic properties of subjects cross-linguistically. In addition,
the subject is the only syntactic role in Supyire which requires a resumptive
pronoun when fronted for focus (see chapter 12, section 12.1.1). Following
are examples of each of the three major clause types, illustrating the order
subject—predicate.

"1.2. The language
Supyire belongs to the Senufo group of the Gur family of Niger-Congo. Although no systematic reconstruction has yet been done, preliminary evidence
indicates that the Senufo languages can be divided into northern, central, and
southern branches. Supyire is the southernmost member of the northern
group, which also includes Minyanka (spoken in Mali to the north of Supyire), Nanerge, and Sucite (spoken in Burkina Faso). All of these languages
are quite closely related to each other. Supyire is separated from the central
Senufo languages to the south by a narrow band of Mande-speaking people.
The Kampwo dialect described in this grammar is only one of several. At
this point little is known of the degree to which the dialects diverge from
each other. Within the Kampwo area the speech is fairly homogenous, and I
had no difficulty in communicating with people 30 kilometers to the south or2Chapter 1: Introduction20 kilometers to the north of Farakala. Further afield, however, there are notable differences which call for investigation.
The Senufo languages are like other Gur languages in having a suffixal
noun class system. They are atypical, however, in having a word order like
that of Mande languages, to which they are geographically contiguous. The
chief peculiarity of this word order is the placement of the direct object before the verb, but of all indirect objects after the verb. This order is an areal
phenomenon, being also shared by Songai to the north, and, to some extent,
by the Kru languages to the south.
The Senufo languages resemble the Mande languages in numerous other
ways besides word order. Many of these similarities are noted in this grammar, and many more would doubtless come to light if the matter were
studied systematically. It is fairly clear that there has been a long history of
bilingualism in Bambara (or its diaspora Jula) among the Supyire. Many
lexical items and quite a few grammatical ones have been borrowed from
Bambara, and it is probable that several grammatical constructions are
caiques on the corresponding Bambara constructions. An effort has been
made to indicate Bambara borrowings in the examples. The Bambara forms
given are taken from Bailleul (1981), though it should be borne in mind that
the dialect recorded there is standard Bambara, whereas the source dialects
for Supyire loans are normally Gana and Sikasso Jula.","[24, 25]"
"1.6. Typological characteristics
Given the typological aims of this grammar, it may be helpful at the outset
to mention some ways in which Supyire may be interesting. In the
phonology, the complications of the tonal system are certainly worthy of
note, in particular the system of four phonemic tones within a three-level
register. In syntax, the word order (with direct object preceding the verb but
all indirect objects following it) alluded to in section 1.2 above is of interest.
Another point of interest is the extensive use of serial verb constructions in
many parts of the grammar.
In complex constructions, the rarity of true embedding is of note. Complement clauses and relative clauses are placed alongside the ""main"" clause in
a nearly paratactic way. The beginnings of embedding can be detected in
both cases, showing that Supyire is at an interesting stage of syntactic
development. Finally, clause chaining is used in connected discourse,
especially narrative, with a system of switch-reference conjunctions unique
to Senufo languages.",[28]
"The absence of any copula in the affirmative, and the absence of any
relative clause morphology or syntax, makes the ""cleft"" look very much
like Y-movement. The construction seems in fact to cover the pragmatic
functions of both clefts and Y-movement (i.e. both strong and somewhat
weaker contrast). I have chosen to label it cleft because of the use of a
copular element in the negative, and because of the use of a place-holding pronoun when the subject is focused. As pointed out by Givön
(1990, chapter 16), in a subject initial language (like English or Supyire) a true Y-movement construction should not be able to code focus on
the subject, since it is already in initial position.
On the face of it this contradicts some predictions based on the
""accessibility hierarchy"" (see Keenan and Comrie 1977, Keenan 1985).
Pronoun retention is typically lower on the hierarchy than gapping.
Supyire is thus unusual in using pronoun retention with subject, which
is the highest point on the hierarchy, and gapping with direct object,
which is lower. Because of the peculiar word order of the Senufo lan-Notes: Chapter 123.","[753, 754]"

"7.1. Basic word order in simple clauses237Chapter 7
Simple clauses
In this chapter the structure of simple (non-complex) clauses will be described. Simple clauses fall into three basic categories based on the type of
predicate they have: those with pronominal predicates (identifier pronouns),
those with copular predicates, and those with verbal predicates. Aside from
this basic categorization, verbal clauses can further be subclassified according to the semantic and pragmatic nominal roles (""cases"") that they have.
After an initial section dealing with the order of constituents in a simple
clause, each of the above categories will be described in turn. The final
category (verbal clauses) comprises by far the greatest variety of subtypes,
and will consequently occupy the bulk of this chapter. The chapter concludes with a section on optional nominal case roles and another on adverbs.","[259, 260]"

"12.1.1. The cleft focusconstructionThe "" c l e f t "" construction in Supyire differs from the construction so labeled
in other languages (e.g. English) in that it has none of the specific trappings
of relative clause syntax, and does not appear to be derived from it in any
way. Indeed, as will be shown in chapter 13, the influence seems to have
been in the opposite direction. The label is justified on two grounds, however. Firstly, the function of the Supyire construction approximates that of
clefts in other languages. Secondly, the Supyire construction shares certain
syntactic characteristics with clefts in other languages, characteristics quite
separate from anything specifically related to relative clauses.
The cleft in Supyire, like that in other languages, functions primarily to
code strong focus on one item in the proposition. As noted in the preceding
section, a speaker may choose to put an item of information under strong focus for a variety of reasons. The focused item may or may not be new information, but the ""out of focus"" part of the construction is typically presupposed (in a pragmatic if not strictly logical sense).
From the coding point of view, the Supyire cleft is like other clefts in the
following ways: the focused noun phrase is placed first, followed, without a
pause, by the rest of the clause containing the presupposed information. The
focused item receives heavy stress, and the rest of the clause is correspondingly relatively unstressed. In the affirmative, no copula or other verbal element marks the focused noun phrase: 1
(1) Sig6
e υ
a
kard.
bush.DEF to s/he PERF go
'It is to the bush that s/he has gone.'
In the negative, the negative identifier bä 'it is not' is placed after the focused noun phrase.
(2) Sig6
e bä
u
a
Jcärd mi.
bush.DEF to it.it.not s/he PERF go
NEG
'It isn't to the bush that s/he has gone.'
The three elements of fronting the focused item, heavy intonational stress
on the focused item, and use of a quasi-copula (at least in the negative) are
all elements shared by typical clefts cross-linguistically. The absence of any
relative clause morphology and syntax (specifically the absence of relative12.1. Focus constructions469pronouns and of the clause final relative marker) is typical of strong focus
constructions in West African languages (see Creissels 1978 for a survey of
twenty languages).
The presupposed, ""out of focus"" clause which follows the focused item is
not marked in any special way in Supyire with one exception. If the tenseaspect is present progressive (with the auxiliary na), the copula pye is inserted before the auxiliary:
(3) Na
mu /
m)i pye na
yu.
with you with I
be PROG speak.IMPFV
'It is with you that I ' m speaking.'
This admittedly restricted marking of the presupposed part of the proposition
is also found in questions and relative clauses, and forms part of the marking
of negation in progressive clauses (see chapter 9, section 9.4.1.2).
When word order is exploited for pragmatic purposes, its function of coding syntactic roles is disrupted. The cleft construction thus creates a ""caserecoverability"" problem: how does the speaker let the addressee know what
the syntactic case role of the focused item is? With a focused direct object, a
simple gap is used. If the verb is transitive, the absence of a direct object between the tense-aspect auxiliary and the verb is a clue to the hearer that this
is where the focused item belongs. Note that when the direct object is removed from its normal position, the intransitive prefix appears on the verb.

IP-call bogoWhen the focused item is the subject, it is immediately followed by a
coreferential anaphoric pronoun. Without this pronoun, the focus construction would be morphologically indistinguishable from an ordinary clause,
since the subject normally comes first in such clauses. The strong stress on
the subject would of course provide an intonational clue, but this is evidently
not sufficient. The pronoun, which like ordinary subjects is unstressed, is an
unmistakable indication that the construction is marked for focus. 2 When the
focused item is a first or second person pronoun, the resumptive pronoun is
third person, gender 1. In the following examples, context has been included
where possible to get a feel for the nature of the focus involved.","[491, 492]"
"4Chapter I:IntroductionThe first assumption is that a language is most insightfully described in
functional terms. Language behavior (like most human and indeed animal
behavior) is for the most part goal directed and purposeful. The forms of a
language (its lexical items and syntactic structures) are analogous to tools.
Accordingly, this description frequently employs the verb 'use'. Speakers
are said to use such and such a construction in order to express such and
such a meaning. More than convention is involved in the linking of a given
form with a certain range of functions. Just as flint is a better material for
cutting than a vine, while a vine is a better material for tying something than
flint, so a given linguistic structure is better suited for some jobs than for
others.
In line with the functional approach is the conceptualization of language as
""code"". In a basic sense the forms of a language exist for the sake of what
they are used to express and not vice versa. The use of the concept of
""code"" can be misleading, however, if it conjures up the idea of an arbitrary
link. The language code, far from being arbitrary, is pervasively shaped by
what it is coding. This shaping results in the essentially iconic nature of
syntax.
Within a code as complex as a natural language, subparts are linked in
subsystems in highly complex ways. Another basic assumption guiding this
description is that it is useful to compare different languages to see how the
subparts interact with each other. It is essential to this typological approach
to describe phenomena in comparable terms. While like any language
Supyire has particularities which require special treatment, a concerted
effort has been made to use generally accepted terminology which will
facilitate cross-linguistic comparison.
A final guiding assumption is that the current state in a language cannot be
understood apart from its history. To return to the tool analogy: in order to
accomplish a novel task, a tool user will select and perhaps modify some
tool whose form is appropriate for the new task. In general, one does not
create a totally new tool from scratch. Thus I may use a screwdriver to pry
off a lid, but would be unlikely to try to perform the same task with a plastic
bag. The plastic bag, however, might come in handy to cover a hole in my
thatch, where a screwdriver would be useless. Neither of these tools was
originally designed for the purpose to which I put them, but their forms
(dictated by their original functions) lend themselves to ""metaphorical""
extension to perform other functions. In a similar way, speakers use the
forms of their language to perform novel tasks.
In order to patch my roof well, I may split open the plastic bag and spread
it out. Although I have modified its form to adapt it to its new function, it
still retains many of the basic characteristics and limitations of its original
form. Historical change in language is analogous. Though a given form may
take on a new function, and be modified in the process, it often continues to1.6. Typological characteristics5retain many of its original characteristics long after the original function is
forgotten.
The historical study of Senufo languages is in its infancy. All too often information which might elucidate peculiarities of Supyire grammar is simply
unavailable. Every effort has been made to indicate etymologies where possible, and quite a bit of speculation about historical antecedents is included.
Much of this will doubtless be superseded, and all speculations should be
treated as such.","[26, 27, 28]"
"Identificational clauses have no further constituents (see following section
for a description). As can be seen from the examples above, however, copular and verbal clauses can and usually do consist of more than simply a subject followed by a copula or verb. Except in the case of existential clauses,
copular clauses have something following the copula, either a predicate
nominal, as in the above example, or an adpositional phrase functioning as a
locative or dative, or an adverb:
(2) a. with locative phrase
U pye bag£
e.
she be house .DEF in
'She's in the house.'
b. with dative phrase
Ku pye m)i ά.
it
be me to
'It's mine (lit. it is to me).'
c. with adverb
U pye ani.
she be there
'She's there.'
The basic structure of copular clauses can thus be summarized as follows:
(3)SUBJECTCOPULAPREDICATE NOMINAL
LOCATIVE OR DATIVE PHRASE
ADVERBVerbal clauses have many more possible constituents. Except in very limited cases, verbal clauses require one or more tense-aspect-modality (ΤΑΜ)
auxiliaries, which immediately follow the subject, and are frequently phonologically cliticized to it. Like copular clauses, verbal clauses may also
have adpositional phrases (functioning as indirect objects with various se-7.2. Ideatificatioaal clauses239mantic roles), a predicate nominal, and adverbs, all of which follow the
verb, as they do the copula:
(4) a. with indirect object
Uakärdsig6e.she PERF go
bush.DEF to
'She went to the bush.'
b. with predicate nominal
Uasiceewe.she PERF be.born woman
'She was born a girl.'
c. with adverb
Usim-paηύτηέ.she FUT FP-come now
'She will come now/
In addition, transitive verbs may take a direct object, which is placed between the auxiliary and the verb:
(5) with direct object
Unmha suroshwoho.she HAB mush cook
'She cooks mush.'
The basic structure of verbal clauses is thus:
(6) SUBJECT ΤΑΜ (DO) VERB (PN) (INDIR OBJS) (ADVERB)
The relative order of the postverbal elements is variable, and a single clause
may have more than one indirect object.
It should be pointed out that any nominal and many adverbs in a copular or
verbal clause may be moved to the beginning of the clause for focus purposes. See chapter 12 for a discussion of this construction. Note that this
means that the subject must be defined (in structural terms) not as the first
nominal of the clause, but as the nominal which immediately precedes the
copula or the auxiliary.","[261, 262]"
"1.7. A word on the examples
The majority of examples used are taken from the text collection alluded to
in section 1.5 above. Occasionally elicited examples are used in the interests
of clarity. Glossing presents a few problems. The sex-based gender system
of English pronouns is a constant annoyance. The gender 1 pronouns of
Supyire are used for human beings of both sexes. In elicited examples the
gloss 's/he' is used for the gender 1 singular pronouns to indicate that a
person of either sex could be intended. In examples taken from texts, the
gloss used is simply 'he* or 'she' depending on the sex of the participant
referred to. It should always be born in mind, however, that the gloss adds
information which is not actually present in the Supyire.
On the other hand, the glosses employed on occasion leave out
information, in the interests of avoiding irrelevant clutter. Thus in much of
the grammar, pronouns of various genders are glossed as 'it', without6Chapter I: Introductionindicating the particular gender involved. In a similar way, definite noun
suffixes are simply labeled 'DEF', without indicating their gender. Anyone
interested in the precise gender of a pronoun or suffix will find the tables in
chapters 3 and 5 handy.
Another case of underdifferentiation in glossing is the narrative conjunctions kä and mä. These are usually glossed simply 'and', although they usually mean something like 'and then' and also include switch reference information: kä indicates different subject, mä same subject as the preceding
clause.
The differences in word order between English and Supyire have made the
free translations of multi-line examples awkward at times. This problem is
especially acute with relative clauses, which in Supyire are preposed to the
main clause rather than embedded. In chapter 13 accordingly many examples
have a more natural translation appended at the end labeled 'Freely... 1 . This
translation is closer to the functional equivalent in English, though of course
it is further from the Supyire form.","[28, 29]"
"14.1. Manipulative speech acts517Chapter 14
Non-declarative speech acts
Most if not all languages distinguish three major sentence types: declarative,
imperative, and interrogative (Sadock and Zwicky 1985). Supyire, in common with all the Senufo languages, conforms to this generalization. The bulk
of this grammar is devoted to declaratives, in conformity with descriptive
tradition. This tradition is probably due to the twin factors of the greater
text-frequency of declaratives and to the greater degree of syntactic elaboration usually found in declaratives (Givön 1990, chapter 18). This chapter in
contrast is devoted entirely to the description of the other two sentence
types.
The three major sentence types can be conceived of as grammaticalized
means of performing three major functions of language: to convey information (declarative), to give orders, requests, invitations or the like
(imperative), and to elicit information (interrogative). In Supyire, as in many
languages, imperatives are principally distinguished by what they lack
(subject, auxiliary) in comparison to other clause types. There is also one
auxiliary used exclusively in a subtype of imperative. Also dealt with in this
chapter is the use of the subjunctive to accomplish a politer manipulation
than the ""bare"" imperative.
Questions in Kampwo Supyire are a more marked sentence type than either
imperatives or declaratives. All questions have some sort of interrogative
particle at the end or, in a few cases, at the beginning of the sentence. In addition, in constituent (""wh"") questions, the use of question words and, in the
majority of questions, the use of the cleft focus construction also mark the
clause as different.
A further characteristic distinguishing both imperatives and interrogatives
from declaratives is the use of the non-declarative set of first and second
person pronouns (for the form of these pronouns see chapter 5, section
5.1.1.2). These special pronouns are not obligatory in imperatives and questions, and in fact, ordinary first and second person pronouns are even more
common in these sentence types. Further, the first person singular non-declarative pronoun na cannot be used as subject. On the other hand, the nondeclarative pronouns cannot be used in declarative sentences, except in three
functions: as reflexive genitive possessors (see chapter 6, section 6.2.1), as
genitive possessors in vocatives (first person only), and in exclamations. Examples of the latter two functions are:518Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts(1) a. vocative, genitive possessor

'But your fruit is delicious!1
c. exclamation, indirect object
Νύ fblä

näf
cow owner PERF grab me.NONDECLon
'The owner of the cow has caught me!'
The vocative can perhaps be distinguished as a minor speech act (getting
the addressee's attention, or acknowledging or establishing a specific level
of politeness or familiarity/formality with the addressee) which is different
from the declarative speech act of conveying information. Exclamations,
when they are complete clauses, are usually syntactically like declaratives in
Kampwo Supyire (there are no 'interrogative' type exclamations like English
'How tall you are!' or 'What a mess you've gotten into!'). The use of the
non-declarative pronouns is an indication that they are not prototypical declaratives. Their major function is certainly not to convey propositional-semantic information. It should also be noted here that the non-declaratives are
sometimes used in poetry in what seem to be declarative clauses. This may
be an indication that their use was more widespread in the grammar formerly.
Aside from these relatively minor uses, the presence of a non-declarative
pronoun constitutes a rather clear indication of the non-declarative status of
the clause in which it occurs. There is some anecdotal evidence that the use
of non-declarative pronouns is at least in some cases more polite than the
corresponding use of ordinary pronouns in the same command or question
would be.","[538, 539, 540, 541]"
"The tilde indicating nasalization will be written under rather than over
the nasalized character in phonetic transcriptions in order to leave room
for tone markings over the character.
2. Nasal + stop clusters are rare in Senufo languages. It appears that they
are a relict in Supyire. In most of the other languages (e.g. Mamara,
Cebaara) a voiceless stop was voiced following a nasal and the nasal
was subsequently lost. In some cases this has led to a three-way contrast
in stops: voiceless, simple voiced, and ""lenis"" voiced (see Prost 1964).
3. Since most loan words are borrowed from Bambara, and since voiced
stops are more numerous in Bambara than voiceless ones, the addition
of loan words raises the ratio of voiced to voiceless stops. For comparison with the ratios given in the main body of the text, the figures are
given here for roots beginning with stops including loans: b/p = 1.33;
d/t = .28; j/c = .37 ; g/k = .05.
4. In fact, none of the palatals except /y/ can occur in a medial unstressed
syllable.
5. Other Senufo languages have many /g/-initial words, but these mostly
appear to be a reflex of proto *gk, which is preserved in Supyire.
6. Several complexities in the morphology are ignored here as irrelevant.
7. One of the three quartiers of the village of Farakala voices much less
enthusiastically than the other two. In another of the quartiers there is
one particular family which is known for its fast, slurred, speech, and it
is here, I suspect, that the champion flapper should be sought.
8. Some speakers will occasionally use a glottal stop in these environments.
9. The pronouns and conditional auxiliary are written separately in keeping with a general decision to write clitics separately in the orthography.
10. The rarity of /g/-initial words was noted above. This verb is borrowed
from Bambara. It requires an indirect object.
11. There is some evidence from internal reconstruction that the process described here as elision was actually historically a multi-stepped process
which involved first elision of an unstressed vowel, subsequent gemination of the two consonants thus brought into contact, followed by de-70212.","[724, 725]"
"14.2.4. ' What about...?' questions
There is a type of question in Supyire which solicits more information than
merely a comment on the truth of the proposition as in a yes/no question, but
does not ask for the hearer to identify a particular referent as in constituent
questions. The speaker rather asks a generalized question 'What about...? 1 ,
and the specific information desired is usually obvious from the context. The
question is marked with the final interrogative particle
which in the examples below will be glossed 'what about* in order to distinguish it from the
interrogative particles discussed in previous sections.
There are two subtypes of 'what about1 questions. The first type consists
simply of a noun phrase with the interrogative particle appended. The addressee must infer from the speech context what information about the referent of the noun phrase the speaker is seeking. In the following example, a
master poses the question to his slave, who had previously been ordered to
fill the master's snuff box. The question therefore means something like
'What have you done with my snuffbox? 1 :(68) Mii batärjidt?my snuff.box.DEF what.about
'What about my snuffbox?'
Similarly, the following example was uttered in the context of a discussion
of who would be going to market that day. The question therefore means
something like 'Are you going too? 1 :
(69)Mu d6?
you what.about
'How about you?'",[568]
"10.1. Transitivity in Supyire
From a purely structural point of view, it is easy to distinguish transitive
from intransitive sentences in Supyire merely by the presence versus the absence of a direct object. Subjects and direct objects are easily distinguishable by their fixed position in the sentence. 1 It is now generally agreed,
however, that a merely structural account of transitivity is hopelessly inadequate. As a means of making cross-linguistic generalizations, categories
such as subject and direct object run into all sorts of difficulties, since a
structural definition valid for one language is often not applicable to another.
There is a considerable literature on this topic (see in particular Keenan
1976, Hopper and Thompson 1980, Givön 1984, 1989, DeLancey 1987).
Two major points have been established in this literature. The first is that
transitivity from a functional point of view is a scalar phenomenon and not a
binary one. The second is that to gain a clear picture of what the function of
a given syntactic role is, one must take into account both semantic and
pragmatic factors.
Assuming the correctness of this approach, what can be said of the roles of
subject and direct object in Kampwo Supyire? The subject is a largely pragmatic role, just as it is in languages like English and French (see Giv6n
1983, 1984: 139). This means that one cannot simply equate the syntactic
role of subject with a semantic role such as agent. The subject of a clause
can in fact also be the semantic patient, recipient, or even some other role.
The choice of which semantic role is to be subject is a pragmatic one. Having said this, it is necessary to affirm that the hierarchy of ""accessibility"" to400Chapter 10: Transitivity and voicesubject (see Keenan 1976, Keenan and Comrie 1977, Givön 1984) which has
been found valid for other languages is also valid for Supyire:
(1) Agent>Recipient >Patient >OtherAccording to this hierarchy, subjects are more likely to be agents than they
are to be any of the other roles. From a pragmatic point of view, of course,
agents tend to be more interesting and relevant, and are therefore better
candidates on the whole for the position of subject.
The choice of direct object, in contrast, is largely semantic: it is almost
always the patient. This sets Supyire apart from languages such as English
which freely allow recipients, and sometimes even roles lower on the hierarchy, such as instrumental or locative, to be ""promoted"" to direct object (the
so-called ""dative shift"" rule). In such languages the direct object can be defined in pragmatic terms as a secondary clause-level topic. Supyire allows
dative shift with only one verb, kan 'give', which may be characterized as
the prototypical three-participant verb, and whose equivalents in other languages are cross-linguistically the most likely to allow recipient direct objects. Most often when the recipient is made the direct object of kan the patient is suppressed altogether. It is, however, possible to include the patient
as an indirect object marked with the postposition na 'on, at': 2
(2) Mli a
ύ
kan bikf3 ηά.
I
PERF him give pen at
Ί have given him a pen.'
Even where they are allowed (i.e. with the verb kan), recipient direct objects
are quite rare. Of 270 occurrences of kan in the corpus, only 8 ( = 3%) have
recipient direct objects. It is significant that all eight are either anaphoric
pronouns or proper names, an indication that only a highly topical recipient
can be promoted. However, by far the great majority of highly topical recipients (coded by anaphoric pronouns or proper names) are not made direct
object.
A few verbs take direct objects with the semantic role of locative, instrument, or time. Thus the normally intransitive verb jiaara 'walk' may take
such direct objects as sig6 'the bush', kuni 'the road', or tatoongo 'a long
way' to indicate where or how far the walking occurs. An example of an instrumental direct object is the use of Iwoho 'water' as the object of wuli
'bathe' to mean 'take a bath' (lit. 'bathe water'). The verb pyi 'do' may
have the sense 'spend' when it has a direct object referring to a span of time.
Very few verbs have been found so far which permit this kind of non-patient
direct object.
It is clear therefore that the direct object role is not primarily a pragmatic
one. Its major function is to code the semantic role of patient. It should be10.2. Detraasitivization401pointed out though that it does not have a corner on patients. As already
noted above, patients can be coded as subject, and as will be shown below,
patients may be ""demoted"" to indirect object.
The ensuing discussion will demonstrate that the factors affecting
""structural"" transitivity (i.e. whether or not a direct object is present) are of
two sorts. One is pragmatic, involving the relative topicality of participants
in the clause. The other is semantic, involving such things as semantic case
roles (agent, patient, recipient, etc.) and the degree of affectedness of the
patient.","[422, 423, 424]"

Although there are no requirements of coreference with the complements
of verbs in this group, as there are for the complements of manipulative and
modality verbs, there often is coreference in fact. The most common type of
coreference is between the subject of the main verb (the original speaker or
thinker) and some noun phrase in the complement clause. The reason that
this is common is of course because people like to talk about themselves.
Many African languages have special pronouns to use in indirect speech
complement clauses in order to show coreference with the main clause subject. 1 0 Supyire does not have a special set of pronouns for this purpose, but
instead uses the emphatic pronouns {uru, pJre, etc. see chapter 5, section
5.1.2.1.2, for the forms). These are used only for third person, there being no
special first or second person forms. The following examples illustrate this
special function of the emphatics:
(53) a. complement subject = main clause subject
U a
jwo na uru
si
s/he PERF say that s/he(EMPH) FUT
'S/he said that s/he would go.'rj-kard.
FP-gob. complement subject * main clause subject
U ä
jwo na u
si
g-Jcard.
s/he PERF say that s/he FUT FP-go
'S/he said that s/he would go.'
In contrast to the coreferential noun phrase in complements of modality or
manipulative verbs, whose syntactic role is restricted (to subject and direct
object, respectively), the coreferential noun phrase in indirect speech may
have any syntactic role. In view of the unpredictability of its role, the use of
the marked emphatic pronoun to indicate coreference (rather than the unmarked anaphoric pronoun as in the other two complement types) makes
sense. The following examples show the coreferential noun phrase in a variety of syntactic roles.","[466, 467]"
"15.1.11. The discourse-thematic function of adverbial clauses
A number of recent studies have drawn attention to the use of various types
of adverbial clause to signal the thematic organizaion of the discourse in
which they occur (see in particular Haiman 1978, Thompson 1985, 1987,
Marchese 1987, Ramsay 1987). This is a large and varied subject which warrants further research.
In a number of languages, and probably in most, some types of adverbial
clause have a discourse-thematic function far beyond merely providing adverbial modification of their main clauses. In some languages, where there is
freedom to place the subordinate clause on either side of its main clause,
preposed adverbial clauses have been found to have a markedly different
discourse function from postposed ones. In general, preposed clauses have
both a linking and a demarcating function: they recapitulate or recall information in the preceding thematic paragraph, while simultaneously indicating
the beginning of a new thematic paragraph (cf. Thompson and Longacre
1985:207f¥). For most adverbial clause types in Supyire, this freedom of
placement is not available. 'When' clauses, for example, must be preposed
to their main clause, while purpose clauses must be postposed.
It is nevertheless not difficult to demonstrate that preposed adverbial time
clauses in sequentially ordered discourse function at the thematic level in a
way similar to preposed 'when' clauses in English. This is illustrated in the
following extract from a procedural discourse on how to construct a granary.",[611]
"111concurrence of form cannot be merely a coincidence, but must be due to
a deep-seated similarity in meaning. In fact the ingredients noted in the
preceding discussion, viz. perfectivity, current (or ""lingering""; Givön
1984: 280) relevance, and anteriority are all characteristics which the
pluperfect shares with the simple perfect.
S6bi (frequently also pronounced s6mi), borrowed from Bambara
sehen, means any piece of paper with writing on it, including books,
letters, and permits. In the context here is indicates the ticket for a
""bush taxi"".
Never/is borrowed from French ncufhcures.
Fwdrdbä 'co-operative society' is borrowed from Bambara fdrdba,
which Bailleul defines as 'bien appartenant h la communaut6'. Darashf
'five francs 1 is borrowed from Bambara dalasi.
As a main verb, ίέέ either takes a dative-experiencer subject with a patient indirect object ( = the thing the experiencer is accustomed to), or
the syntactic roles are reversed, with the patient as subject and the dative-experiencer as indirect object. The serial construction follows the
first configuration in having the dative-experiencer as subject. See
chapter 7, section 7.4.3.2 for examples.
Comrie calls these tenses ""combinations of absolute tenses"". In Supyire
they are not absolute, however, as the reference point can be in the past
or future, as will appear below.
The progressive marker here is a relic of the origin of the future auxiliary as an imperfective verb.
The low tone on sähä here is due to the spread of the floating low tone
following the subject, not to the negative auxiliary.
The term ""main line"" is used to denote independent clauses which encode the events of the narrative in their proper chronological order. It
thus excludes all clauses encoding background information, and all subordinate clauses.
In poetry the earlier form warf is attested.
Comrie (1986: 26-28, 61, 103) also doubts that the so-called ""sequential"" tenses actual code sequentiality. He claims that the sequentiality
can in most if not all cases be attributed to an ""implicature"", and that it
is not part of the meaning of the grammatical forms in question. There
can be no rigid dividing line between ""implicature"" and ""meaning"",
however, since in historical change yesterday's ""implicature"" often
becomes today's ""meaning"". Certainly if the speaker regularly intends
the hearer to draw a certain inference from a given grammatical form,
and in fact counts on that inference being drawn (i.e. it becomes a
""conventional implicature""), the stage is set for the inference to become
part of the ""meaning"" of the form. Since the narrative/sequential auxiliary in Supyire can only be used under certain well-defined conditions,
one of which is that the chronological sequence must be observed724Notes: Chapter 9(events can overlap or occasionally be simultaneous, but not out of order), it seems clear that the speaker intends the hearer to understand this
to be indicated by the use of the auxiliary.
36 See Carlson 1986 and chapter IS below for a description of the switchreference system of Supyire.
37. It looks very much like the perfect marker ä (this would explain the low
tone on the final vowel of AS/), but it is unclear how the meaning
(sequential with middle strength thematic continuity) could be derived
from a composition of the perfect with a non-finite form. It could be
that the original meaning of the perfect (possibly 'come', as noted
above) could have been at the origin of this construction.
38. The leaves referred to are dead leaves with which the yam mounds have
been covered in order to keep in moisture till the yams sprout.
39. The subject refers to a very old man who was incapable of walking. He
used to be brought outside and 'spread out' in the sun—the verb is the
one used for spreading out grain or cotton to dry. Cängke is 'sunlight'
or 'daylight', and is the common word for 'day' as well'.
40. The subject refers to a fish caught by the speaker. Supyire fishermen
are as prone to exaggeration as fishermen elsewhere.
41. C6g6imanner, way, means' is borrowed from Bambara cogo, with the
same meaning.
42. Occasionally one even hears [d] instead of [r] (or [s]). Since [r] is an
allophone of /d/ in unstressed medial syllables, it is not surprising that
some speakers, when for whatever reason they introduce a slight pause
just after the future auxiliary, interpret the [r] that normally appears
there as /d/.
43. To 'answer the yes' means to supply the interjections and murmers of
assent at the end of each breath group during a monologue by another
speaker. The speaker of this example is about to launch into a narrative,
and wants to make sure that someone is designated to 'answer the yes'.
44. This is evidence that the original form of the auxiliary was ba.
45. Jinä is borrowed (via Bambara) from Arabic jiimiy. In the Supyire cosmology it refers to tutelary spirits which inhabit streams.
46. The construction is rather similar in meaning to the French expression
Void que...
47. Although the perfect auxiliary is written separately in this construction,
for most speakers the vowel following the glottal stop is not in reality
long (/nähä ä/ becomes [nä?ä]). Note that the low tone of the perfect
auxiliary replaces the high on the final vowel of nähä.
48. Compare the similar construction with säJiä described in section 9.2.5
above.
49. The development from 'create' to 'reputed' probably went through
some such stage as 'imagine'. Compare the development of English fie-Notes: Chapter 9725tion from the past participle of the Latin verb fingere 'shape, fashion,
feign'.
50. Buwara was the first inhabitant of the region including Kampwo, according to legend. This speaker believes, though he is not certain, that
Buwara was a Samogo (a Mande-speaking people whose territory at
present divides the Supyire from the central Senufo groups) who came
from Kong, a city in northern C6te d'lvoire.
51. Ja is also used as a main verb in the common expression for 'thank
you': Mu a jä. Literally this means 'You have overcome.'
52. Following a high tone, mä is pronounced a step lower, as if it were mid
tone, due to downstep (see chapter 2, section 2.3.5.1). Since nothing follows in the clause (and the tone register is generally reset during the
pause following the m£), the terracing effect of the downstep is not felt.
To avoid encumbering the orthography with apostrophes, therefore, the
negative particle following a high tone is simply written as if it were
mid, i.e. me. The same practice is followed for other high tone clause final particles such as the relative clause marker k6 and the interrogative
marker be.
53. Coming at the edge of the clause as it does, this looks superficially like
evidence for the analysis of negation as it is treated in propositional calculus, as an operator on a proposition. The placement of negative marking at the periphery of a clause is extremely rare (see Dahl 1979), which
Horn (1989) takes to be good evidence that such an analysis is misguided. The value of the Senufo ""evidence"" is of course considerably
vitiated by the occurrence of negative marking in the auxiliary position
in most tense-aspects, a placement that is cross-linguistically common.
54. Pyenga 'compound, home' has a mid-low tune, the final low of which
floats and docks on the following negative marker.
55. Yatooro, literally 'things with legs', has the same mid-low tone tune as
pyenga referred to in the previous note.
56. Thus in spite of its consistent clause final negative marking, Supyire
also abides by the ""Neg First principle"" (Horn 1989: 449, quoting Jespersen) to the effect that negative marking is placed first or near the
beginning of the sentence in the interests of clearness. Without such
early marking, of course, the hearer would be unaware that the current
clause was negative until it was terminated.
57. Horn (1989: 190), picking up on a hint in Clark (1974), uses the term
suppose rather than presuppose to label this ""entertainment"" of the affirmative, which obviously does not qualify as presupposition in the
strict sense. As Giv<Sn (1989) points out, the information must be assumed to be backgrounded in order for the negative to be pragmatically
felicitous, and this same notion covers the other cases of the use of the
combination pye na.","[746, 747, 748]"
"Sometimes a speaker puts the Bambara purpose clause conjunction walisa
in front of a different subject subjunctive purpose clause. The following example contains two purpose clauses, the second giving the purpose of the
first, which is preceded by the subordinator walisa:
weyi

as the preceding one:

The etymology of ni is unknown at present. This type of purpose clause
can only be equi-subject with the main clause. The ni purpose marker is
followed by the future prefix, a fact obscured in the above example since a
direct object immediately follows it. Following is a clearer example, with
two /z/clauses:

The third type of purpose clause has the form of a special type of bä...mi
clause. Ordinary bä...mi clauses were described above (section 15.1.4) in
their function as comparison clauses. To function as purpose clauses they
must have a distinctive internal structure consisting of an initial potential
clause with the verb pyi 'do,be', followed by a same subject subjunctive
clause which is in fact identical to a subjunctive purpose clause as described
above. The entire two clause structure is bracketed by subordinators bä and
me.

"10.2.1. Passive
It is important to recall at the outset that passive clauses in Supyire are not
morphologically distinguished in any way from simple intransitive clauses
(see chapter 7, section 7.4.1). 4 They can only be differentiated from ordinary
(active or stative) intransitive clauses on the basis of their meaning. Like the
statives, passives have subjects with the semantic role of patient. They can
be differentiated from the statives and the active intransitives on the basis of
the verb: an intransitive clause with a patient subject and a normally transitive verb must be passive.
In order to give some substance to the ""normally"" of the last sentence, the
most commonly occurring transitive verbs in the corpus were tabulated. A402Chapter 10: Transitivity and voicetotal of 21 transitive verbs occur more than 20 times each in the corpus. 5
These are given in Table 35 together with the percentages of occurrences of
each verb in transitive, passive, and active intransitive clauses.","[424, 425]"

effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the people'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

k<<The majority of constituent questions in Supyire are in the form of cleft focus constructions. The question word, or the noun phrase containing it, is
fronted to focus position at the head of the clause. The same case recoverability strategies are used as in clefts: a resumptive pronoun for subjects, a
gap for direct objects, and adpositional marking of the focused item for indi-534Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsrect objects (see chapter 12, section 12.1.1). The information which the
speaker and hearer share is placed in the presupposed clause following the
focused item. Following are examples illustrating a questioned subject (35a),
direct object (35b), and indirect objects (35c, d):

QThe focused noun phrase containing the question word is not always
moved to the absolute beginning of the sentence. It may be preceded by a
phrase in topic position, from which it is typically separated by a pause. The
topic usually delimits a domain within which the desired information is to be
sought. Thus in the following example, taken from a riddle-like story, the answer to the question is to be chosen from the list in topic position:

"14.2. Questions
Questions in Supyire, like those in most languages (cf. Sadock and Zwicky
1985: 178), can be broadly classified into two major types: yes/no questions
and constituent questions (Sadock and Zwicky call them ""information"" questions). The two types are distinguished in Supyire by the different interrogative particles they require, and by the presence of question words in constituent questions versus their absence in yes/no questions. These two major
types of question are dealt with in the first two principal subsections of this
section.
In addition to the major question types, there are a couple of minor types.
Alternative questions (see section 14.2.1.4) are similar to yes/no questions,
and are historically related to them. The 'What about ...' question type (see
section 14.2.4) is more like a constituent question in function, but lacks a
question word. Two further subsections deal with subjects related to questions: complex questions (section 14.2.3), and non-interrogative uses of
questions (section 14.2.5).",[549]
"2818.1. Serials versus consecutives283Chapter 8
Serial verb constructions
8.1. Serials versus consecutives
In common with most other West African languages, Supyire makes frequent use of serial verb constructions. These are mid-way in complexity
between simple clauses as described in the preceding chapter, and the complex sentences to be described in chapters 11 through 15. There is a considerable literature on serial verbs. Much of the early debate revolved on the
question of whether or not serial verbs should be derived from coordinate
clauses (cf. Stahlke 1970, Schachter 1973, Lord 1973; cf. also Matisoff
1969, Foley and Van Valin 1984). The general consensus was that they
should not. The chief reason for this is the grammaticalization so common in
the construction (see Lord 1973, Giv6n 1975, 1984) which means that the
verb involved has one sense when a main verb and quite another when in a
serial construction. It is therefore better to treat these constructions as belonging to multi-verb clauses, rather than as a variety of conjoined sentence.
Supyire has four different types of serial verb construction (described in
detail in section 8.2 below). The choice of which one to use is mainly governed by tense-aspect and modality. Two of the types employ what might be
analyzed as connectives, which by some definitions disqualifies them as serial verbs. On this view serial verbs must be concatenated without the use of
any coordinating or subordinating conjunctions. Constructions which use
conjunctions but which otherwise resemble serial constructions must in this
analysis be classified as ""consecutive constructions"" (cf. Hyman 1971). The
four constructions which will be classified here as serial, however, share important common characteristics which serve to differentiate them as a group
from other same subject concatenations.
In Supyire, chains of same subject clauses in sequentially organized discourse are conjoined with a variety of conjunctions which signal greater or
lesser semantic and pragmatic closeness between the conjuncts. Fairly loose
connection is signaled by the complex conjunctions maä (for perfective) and
marii (for imperfective). Both of these conjunctions incorporate the narrative
tense-aspect auxiliary si.1 They both also share the initial element ma, which
when it occurs by itself (and with a low tone) signals a much closer connection between the conjuncts.
It is certainly no accident that mä is identical to the original form of the
perfect auxiliary, i.e. mä, now found mostly in poetry, the [m] regularly284Chapter 8: Serial verb constructionseliding in ordinary speech to yield i. 2 Like the perfect, mä requires the following verb to be in its neutral, perfective form.
Three things should be noted about this level of concatenation. First, indirect objects are allowed to intervene between verbs. The individual conjuncts look simply like clauses without subjects (of course the tense-aspect
marking is minimal as well). Second, a direct object of an earlier verb can
be coded with an anaphoric pronoun as the direct object of a later verb in the
chain. Although an anaphoric object is usually not repeated, that is, zero
anaphora is most often used, what is important is that an anaphoric pronoun
direct object can be interpreted as being coreferential with an earlier noun
phrase in the chain. Following is an example of this type of coreference:
(1) Käzäntügös)pwun ""ηεέηίηέέηέand hyena
NARR dog tail.DIM.DEF taste
'Then Hyena tasted Dog's little tail
mä Π täΙέέtään.and it find it.COMP PERFbe.sweet
and found it tasted sweet.'
The third important thing to note about this relatively close level of concatenation is that a verb may be repeated in order to show duration:
(2) Käu ύtf-kärääsäjiäara mäpaara.and he NARR IP-go SC go walk and walk
'Then he went and walked and walked.'
It is this type of concatenation which will be called the ""consecutive construction"" in this grammar. Although this label is not entirely satisfactory,
since concatenation through repetition of the progressive aspect auxiliary na
more often codes simultaneity than sequentiality, it is a term familiar in African linguistics for a similar level of conjoining. For a description of this
construction and higher levels of concatenation, see chapter 15 below.
The serial verb constructions to be described in this chapter represent a
closer level of connection than the consecutive construction. Each of the
three points noted as being true of the consecutive are disallowed in the serial construction. Thus regarding the first point, in contrast to the consecutive construction, indirect objects are not generally allowed to intervene
between the verbs of a serial construction. In the following exchange, taken
from a conversation between three men, the first speaker, recounting the end
of a story about one of his interlocutors, conjoins two clauses with mä. The
first verb of the construction has a locative indirect object which immediately follows it. The second speaker echoes the first in a question to the person about whom the story has been told. He encodes the same prepositional
information as the first speaker, but using a serial construction (the serial8.1. Serials versus coosecutives285connective is a). Note how the locative phrase must be moved to the right so
as not to intervene between the serialized verbs, even though it belongs semantically with the first verb.

mäshwbn.","[304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"
"15.3.2. SwitchreferenceWhat distinguishes Supyire from other African languages is the use of the
conjunctions kä and mi to signal switch reference. The development of
switch reference markers from conjunctions is well documented. Cases have
been reported in such widely diverse languages as Polish (see Frajzyngier
1986), Green Hmong (see Li 1990), Pima and Papago (see Scancarelli
1989), and Paez (see Gerdel and Slocum 1976).
Switch reference systems of the Supyire sort, on the other hand, differ
from the type found in New Guinea, in which the clause with the finite verb
is placed at the end of the clause chain rather than at the beginning. Preceding clauses in the chain are in a medial, less finite form. There is a cline of
finiteness, ranging from the most finite final verb form through the different
subject medial verb form, with the least finite form being the same subject
medial verb form. Supyire displays the same cline, although the finite clause
comes first rather than last in the chain.
The Supyire switch reference system, like those reported in other languages, has the ability to ""skip"" over subordinate clauses. Thus a same subject clause may be used following a different subject subordinate clause, if
the preceding narrative clause has the same subject. Following are examples
of this:

Focus and topic constructions
The bulk of this chapter is concerned with two constructions, one coding
contrastive focus, the other a marked topic. In both constructions, one noun
phrase is placed at the beginning of the clause rather than in its ordinary
place. This placement in initial position can be attributed to a very general
principle whereby information which is less predictable and/or more important tends to get mentioned first. This in turn is due to a very general cognitive principle that more attention is typically accorded to information which
comes first. Speakers exploit this principle in order to make sure the appropriate amount of attention is paid to the various bits of information in a
communication (see Givön 1985, 1988, 1990).
In addition to these two constructions, two other means of coding focus
and topic are dealt with in this chapter: the contrastive genitive construction,
and marking of topic by means of the particle kbtii.","[488, 489, 490]"
"13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses
Relative clauses in such languages as English and French are commonly divided into ""restrictive"" and ""non-restrictive"". This is unnecessary in Supyire
for the simple reason that all relative clauses are restrictive. Non-restrictive
relative clauses, in those languages which have them, function mainly to
code parenthetical assertions. This function is accomplished by simple
parataxis in Kampwo Supyire. Thus the following example can reasonably
be translated idiomatically in English with a non-restrictive relative clause.
Note, however, that there is nothing in the Supyire which resembles the kind
of relative clause structure described below in this section.
(1)Kälires)and it(EMPH) NARR
'It ( = the bird)
wocbnqinäcedyijwümp6punfIdgd.crocodile.DEF and woman.DEF say.DEF all hear
heard all of the crocodile's and the woman's words.
(CeöqimigääpyiNteencwö.)woman.DEF name PERFbe Nteencwo
The woman's name was Nteencwo.
Käcedijis)ή-kärd...and woman.DEF NARR IP-go
Then the woman went...'
Freely: 'It heard all the words of the crocodile and the woman,
whose name was Nteencwo. Then the woman left...'
All relative clauses in Supyire, then, are restrictive. They serve to restrict
the reference or interpretation of the noun they modify (though see below on488Chapter 13: Relative clauses""afterthought"" relatives). In the most typical case, the speaker provides information in the relative clause which allows the addressee to uniquely identify the referent of the modified noun. In order to accomplish this function,
the information provided must be about the referent, and must be known to
or inferable by the addressee. Relative clauses thus contain a noun phrase
which is coreferential with the noun phrase being modified in the main
clause, and the information they contain is most often treated as presupposed
by speakers (cf. Givdn 1990, chapter 15).1 It is not surprising that such
clauses share basic characteristics with cleft focus constructions and the
commonest type of constituent questions, both of which consist of an initial
noun phrase followed by a clause containing presupposed information. Neither of these constructions derive historically from the present day relative
clause construction, however.
Relative clauses in Supyire are unembedded. 2 The most typical variety,
with definite, referential heads, are preposed to the main clause. The relative
clause is terminated by the clause final relative marker k6, frequently voiced
to g6, and is typically followed by a short pause before the main clause. 3

mu a
kürü
c6.
thing.DEF it PERF him kill REL you PERF it(EMPH) know
'The thing that killed him, you know it.'
Freely: 'You know the thing that killed him'
The etymology of k6 is not certain, but it is undoubtedly related to the locative question marker of the identical form k6 (see chapter 14, section
14.2.2.7). A connection between a locative question word or marker and the
relative clause marker is attested in a number of languages (see Givön
1990b, where Krio, modern Greek, southern colloquial German, and Bambara are cited). Both the relative k6 and the interrogative k6 are quite likely
derived from the gender 2 singular demonstrative r)k6. The corresponding
relative marker in Cebaara is
which is probably derived from the gender
3 singular demonstrative tee. In Cebaara the marker is generally placed after
the verb rather than at the end of the relative clause. This placement and the
demonstrative etymology can be taken as indications that the markers had a
nominalizing function originally.
As noted above, in the canonical relative clause construction there are two
coreferential noun phrases, one in the relative clause and one in the main
clause. The first of these we will call the ""relativized noun phrase"". It is in
some respects like the ""head"" noun phrase in a language like English, since
it comes first in the construction and is more fully specified. The noun
phrase in the following main clause, which is typically pronominalized, will
be labeled simply as the ""coreferential noun phrase"". The relativized noun
phrase is most frequently placed at the beginning of the relative clause, and
may or may not be additionally marked with an ordinary demonstrative or13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses489with a relative determiner. The coreferential noun phrase typically takes the
form of an emphatic pronoun (e.g. uru, pire, etc.; see section 13.3 below for
a discussion of the use of these pronouns), and occurs in the position it
would normally take in the clause (that is, it is most often not focused). The
following example (as well as the previous one) illustrates all these features.
In it the relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, and the
coreferential noun phrase is likewise the subject of the main clause:
(3) Pücwdgi
u
jjye ηά
mu f
ke,
girl.DEF(GlS) she(GlS) be with you with REL
'The girl who is with you,
uru
si
ή-kwü.
she(EMPH.GlS) FUT FP-die
she will die.'
Freely: 'The girl who is with you will die.'
The similarity of this construction with the left dislocated topic construction described in chapter 12 (section 12.2.2) should be noted. In a topic construction, the topicalized noun phrase is placed before the main clause, from
which it is typically separated by a pause. The position from which it was removed in the main clause is typically indicated by a pronoun, most often an
emphatic pronoun. It looks as though the relativized noun phrase together
with its modifying clause is being treated syntactically as if it were a topic
noun phrase. Looked at from a functional point of view, this is not very
strange. As noted in chapter 12, left dislocated topics are generally not
highly ""continuous"". That is, they most frequently represent a switch from
the topic of the previous bit of discourse. Participants introduced with relative clauses tend to be even more discontinuous. About 70% of relativized
noun phrases refer to participants not previously referred to in the discourse
in which they are found.
The ""canonical"" structure described in the preceding paragraphs can be
varied in a number of ways. These variations are the subject of the remaining subsections of this chapter. One of them can be disposed of immediately,
however, since it is rather minor. The final relative clause marker k6 is
sometimes replaced with the functionally equivalent marker ä de. This is extremely rare in the corpus (3 examples, out of a total of 288 relative
clauses). It may be dialectal or archaic (all three examples were produced by
two very old men not from Farakala) although I encountered no difficulty in
eliciting examples from young people in Farakala. The etymology of the ä de
marker is unknown, though it is quite possibly related to the relative clause
marker in Cebaara, id. Following is an example of an ä de relative. The relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, the coreferential
noun phrase is a genitive possessor in a focused time phrase in the main490Chapter 13: Relative clausesclause. The sentence is taken from a quotation, which accounts for the use of
would in the English translation:

Freely: '(On) the twentieth day of the month which was just about to
begin he would catch Samory.'
Another variation which is also not very important in terms of the number
of tokens (N = 3) recorded so far is the delaying of the relative clause till
after the main clause, apparently because it is an afterthought. Following is
an example:

RELThe other variations in relative clause structure and function treated below
are: the different ways of coding the relativized noun phrase, including
whether or not it is fronted (section 13.2); the different ways of coding the
coreferential noun phrase in the main clause (section 13.3); the treatment of
non-referential relativized noun phrases (section 13.4) and referential indefinite relativized noun phrases (section 13.5); and negative relative clauses
(section 13.6). A final section (13.7) describes ""semi-embedding"" and discusses the syntactic status of relative clauses.","[510, 511, 512, 513]"
"15.1.10. PurposeclausesThere are four distinct clause types regularly used as purpose adverbial
clauses. The first is a simple subjunctive clause, as in the following example:586Chapter 15: Interclausal connections(90) Pi na

Such a purpose clause can only be postposed to its main clause. If the purpose clause has the same subject as the main clause, its subject is omitted,
leaving the clause to begin with the subjunctive auxiliary, as in the above example. The purpose clause can also have a different subject:

"14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions
Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the question words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occasionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and emphatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]
"718 Notes: Chapter 8
59. This is the ubiquitous verb pyi ' d o ' which has already been mentioned
frequently in the preceding sections as having the senses 'become, be
(non-present tense), call'.
60. With a complement clause, kanmeans 'give in order that...'.
61. With an indicative na complement, ßye means 'see (realize) that...',
with a real is (H tone) complement, it means 'see someone/something

62. This is borrowed from Bambara /n/zr/'think'.

64. Cya 'try' is also used as a transitive verb meaning 'seek f o r ' .
65. This is not surprising in view of the fact that many of the adverbs are
derived from nouns. They have shed any adpositional marking they may
have had, and they no longer inflect as nouns, but many of them carry
the vestiges of noun class morphology. See chapter 5, section 5.5.

"262Chapter 7: Simple clauses7.4.4. TransitiveverbsIn this section we will examine those verbs which ordinarily take a direct
object. Before proceeding to a closer look at the various configurations of
semantic roles possible with this large group, a word should be said about
the intransitive use of these verbs. For the great majority, the intransitive has
passive meaning, the subject in this case coding the patient of change. This
passive use is described in section 10.2.1 of chapter 10. Besides the passive,
there are two other constructions which detransitivize transitive verbs. These
are the suppression of the patient of certain verbs verbs and the demotion of
the patient to an indirect object role with a few other verbs. Both of these
are relatively minor constructions in terms of the number of verbs they can
occur with. They are dealt with in sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 of chapter 10.","[284, 285]"
"14.2. Questions535Not all constituent questions are cast in cleft form. A small minority of examples in the corpus have their question word in the place it would take in a
declarative sentence. This may be partly a result of influence from Bambara,
which does not place focused items or question words at the beginning of the
clause. It may also be due to some as yet undetected pragmatic factor(s).
Following is an example of a questioned direct object left in its normal position:

kanha na bi?
I
SUBJUNC go what say dead(GlP) village at Q
'What must I go say in the village of the dead?'
Supyire also allows ""double"" questions, in which two constituents rather
than just one are questioned. In such questions, only one of the questioned
words is fronted, and the other is left in its ordinary place:
(39) Jö

"8.3.1. Deictic motionverbsMotion verbs, usually accompanied by a locative indirect object or a locative adverb, are often used as V2 in order to indicate the direction of the action designated by VI. They often thus are equivalent in information value
to prepositions in a language like English. The most commonly used verbs
for this purpose are: pa 'come', kare 'go', jye 'enter', fworo 'exit', dugo
'ascend', tigd 'descend', and y)r) 'get up, leave'. Sometimes cwo 'fall' is
also used to indicate downward motion. A very common combination is the
verb / w i ' t a k e ' plus pa 'come' or kare 'go' to mean 'bring' or 'take':

locative adjunct (see chapter 7, section 7.4.3.1), but which regularly combine with one of the above verbs, whose function is to indicate the direction
of the motion. Note the following examples with the verbs fe 'run' and yi

"294Chapter 8: Serial verb constructions8.3. Grammaticalized verbs
In this section we will survey the verbs which have developed specialized,
more abstract meanings when they occur in serial constructions. They are
roughly categorized semantically into deictic motion verbs, temporal and aspectual verbs, modality verbs, case marking verbs, and ""adverbial"" verbs.
Before proceeding with this survey, it should be pointed out that although
a given verb may be grammaticalized it is not necessarily so, even when it
occurs in the right position in a serial construction. In the following example
the verb yaa is in the right position (VI) to have its grammaticalized sense
of 'V2 well' (see section 8.3.5.9 below), but in fact retains its basic lexical
meaning of 'fashion, make, create'.
(24)Ρ irekäy)rdyälaäpa ...they(EMPH) COND these(EMPH) make SC come

Although no examples have been recorded in texts, elicitation reveals that
a predicate nominal, which normally follows its verb just as postpositional
adjuncts do, must also be placed after a verb or postposition governing the
nominalized clause to which it belongs, as in the following example:

they are indefinite, they resemble predicate adjectives in English and similar
languages. Two comments are in order, however. The first is that the normal
function of predicate adjectives in English, viz. the predication of a quality,
is ordinarily performed by simple verbal clauses with stative verbs in Supy-228Chapter 6: Noun phrasesire. The use of adjectives in predicate nominal position is relatively rare. The
other fact which must be noted is that frequently the adjective in predicate
nominal position has a deontic reading: it indicates what should or must be
done. 19 Following are some examples without such deontic meaning:

"14.2.3. Complex questions
The restrictions on the questioning of items in subordinate or coordinate
clauses is a large topic which needs to be further explored. Only a few observations will be made here, first on questions with serial verb constructions, and then on questions with complement clauses. Many of the examples
in this section were elicited rather than culled from texts, and several of
them are manifestly unusual from a pragmatic point of view. The generalizations drawn therefore should only be considered as tentative.
Questioning of the subject in a sentence with serial verbs presents no difficulty, since all the verbs must share a common subject. The usual method,
with a resumptive pronoun, is used:
(59) Jlähä ku si
fi-jä
vwdro
j)g6 mobiligi i
ye?
what it FUT FP-be.ableFP-go.out this car.DEF from Q
'What will be able to get out ofthat car?'
There are restrictions on the questioning of direct objects, however. If only
one of the verbs in the serial construction is transitive, there is no problem,
and the object of either the initial (60a) or the final verb (60b) can be questioned without difficulty:
(60) a. Jlähä u a
lwb a kärd pyenga ye?
what s/he PERF take SC go

'What did s/he take (lit. take and go) home?'
b. Jla/iä mu a
teen na
wii
ύ ' tään ye?
what you PERF sit
PROG look.at her beside Q
'What are you sitting and looking at beside her?'
If both verbs are transitive, the direct object of the first (61a) can be questioned in the ordinary way (i.e. by means of placing the question word in focus position), but this is not possible with the direct object of the second
verb (61b):
(61) a. Jlähä u a
täha ä kyaäre

"11.1. Types of complemea t cla use4 21Chapter 11
Complement clauses
As in most languages, certain verbs in Supyire can take a clause as an argument in place of a noun phrase. These ""complement"" clauses can fill the role
of subject or object. The bulk of this chapter (sections 11.1 through 11.5) is
concerned with the latter type, for which the term ""complement clause"" will
be reserved. Section (11.6) will briefly examine sentential subjects. The final
section discusses the theoretical implications raised by the unusual complement structures of Supyire.","[442, 443, 444]"

"42Chapter 2: Phonology2.3. Tone
Tone has a high functional load in Supyire. Boys cowherding in the bush
often communicate with each other by whistling. The whistling contains no
other information than vowel length and pitch, but this is sufficient to permit
fairly detailed conversations. In learning to speak Supyire I often had the experience of an interlocutor interpreting my speech on the basis of my
(incorrect) tones, assuming that I had mistaken the consonants and vowels,
which were in fact much closer to what they were supposed to be than the
tones.
There are four phonemic tones. The high (H) and low (L) are fairly ordinary, but the middle two are differentiated in behavior rather than pitch. One
of these, which we will call strong mid (Ms) undergoes substantially less
perturbation than the other, which we will call weak mid (Mw). As will become apparent, weak mid resembles high in its behavior. Northern Senufo
languages (Supyire, Sucite, Mamara) all have both weak and strong mid
tones. Central Senufo languages such as Cebaara and Shenara, however,
seem to have a more conventional three tone-system. Cebaara cognates for
Supyire weak mid verbs are mostly high tone. Garber (1987: 227) suggests
that proto-Senufo had a four-tone, four-pitch system, and that the upper of
the two middle tones was subsequently lost in some languages by merger
with high.32 In northern Senufo the upper of the two middle tones has
merged phonetically (that is, it is realized on the same phonetic pitch) with
the other mid tone. This phonetic neutralization has not entailed serious
phonological neutralization, however, due to the complex tone rules of
Supyire. In effect, the two mid tones behave quite differently with respect to
tone rules, and consequently, in the majority of environments one or the
other is possible, but not both. Consider the following example. When a
weak mid noun occurs as the possessed noun in a genitive construction in
which the possessor is the first person singular pronoun mH\ it is raised to
high tone: cig6 'the tree' becomes m)i cige 'my tree' (the -ge is the definite
noun suffix for gender 2 singular). When a strong mid noun occurs in the
same environment, however, it keeps its mid tone: bag6'the house' stays m)i
bag6. The multiplicity of rules of this sort ensure that words with weak mid
tone are nearly always distinguished from those with strong mid tone.
As in many tone languages, different subsystems of the language exhibit
somewhat different tonal behavior. In particular, verbs, nouns, pronouns, and
adverbs all differ in tonal behavior. Verbs and pronouns are rather more susceptible to perturbation than nouns, which in turn are more perturbable than
adverbs.
Syllabic nasals and of course vowels may bear significant tone. In
addition, initial nasals which precede stops may also carry significant tone
(with important restrictions—see below), but word-medial nasals which
precede stops always take the tone of the previous vowel. A stressed vowel2.3. Tone43may carry up to three tones, but this is rare. Rather more common are
vowels with two tones, but by far the most common are vowels with one
tone. Pre-stop nasals and unstressed vowels may only carry one tone.
Spreading rules must sometimes make reference to moras.
Tone rules are also sensitive to different kinds of boundary. Most tone
rules apply only in relatively close syntactic environments, such as between
possessor and possessed in genitive constructions, between direct object and
verb, between noun phrase and postposition. In other contexts, even within
the same clause, a rule may not apply. Certain morphological boundaries are
impermeable to tone spreading, but allow feature changing rules to apply
across them.
The following discussion will begin with an examination of basic tone
tunes and then proceed to an exposition of the various rules needed to
account for the Supyire data.","[64, 65, 66]"
"13.3. The preferential noun phrase in the main clause503The coreferential noun phrase may be modified by a quantifier not present
in the relativized noun phrase, again rendering its meaning more precise.
The following example has an indefinite/partitive determiner (cf. also (11a)
above, with the quantifier 'all'):
(25) Μρίί

Freely: Ί don't know any of the people whom you are naming.'
When the relativized noun phrase is a first or second person pronoun, the
coreferential noun phrase is the same pronoun, as in (16) above. When the
relativized noun phrase is non-referential, the second person singular pronoun is sometimes used as a coreferent, in a manner reminiscent of the nonreferential use of 'you' in English. (The following example is also of interest
in that it has a topic noun phrase preceding the relative clause.)

in Supyire, as is common in languages with gender systems. Thus while gender 1 can be characterized semantically as the ""human"" gender, there are a
few words in other genders which can be used to refer to human beings. The
gender 2 noun yaaga 'thing', for example, is sometimes used in a rather informal way to refer to a person. In syntactically ""tight"" constructions, such
as within a noun phrase, agreement is governed entirely by grammatical
gender. In ""loose"" constructions, however, such as between clauses, there is
a tendancy to revert to a more semantically appropriate gender. Note in the
following example that the relative determiner agrees with its gender 2 head
noun, but the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause is gender 1, which
is more semantically appropriate:

Relative clauses in which the relativized noun phrase functions to encode
time frequently function as time adverbial clauses for the following main
clause, and in this case there is usually no coreferential noun phrase in the
main clause. (18) above is an example of this. Often the noun cyaga 'place'
is used instead of a time word:

"14.1. Manipulative speech acts
""Manipulative speech act"" as used here encompasses such subcategories as
commands, requests, and invitations.1 For such a speech act to be felicitous,14.1. Manipulative speech acts519the manipulee must be both free to perform the desired action and at least
theoretically capable of doing so. 2 It follows that most predications of states
(e.g. 'be talF, 'be fat') and involuntary active verbs (e.g. 'sneeze', 'snore')
would not normally be used in imperatives. At any rate, I was unable to induce any speaker of Supyire to use such verbs in any of the constructions to
be described below in this section.
Successful manipulation also normally requires that the manipulator have
some socially based right to carry out the manipulation. The social standing
of interlocutors can of course vary considerably, and Supyire, like other languages, is sensitive to these differences. Thus one important parameter along
which the constructions described below vary is that of politeness or deference. In general the shorter and less finite the form of the utterance, the less
polite or deferential it is.
A further condition that usually applies to manipulative speech acts is that
the desired state of affairs does not yet exist at the time of utterance. All the
forms described here are thus irrealis. It is noteworthy in this regard that the
simple future can be used to convey an order, though this practice does not
appear to be at all common. Following is an example, taken from a folktale
recounting the origins of jealousy:

The first three subsections below describe forms primarily used in manipulative speech acts proper. That is, their subjects are understood to refer to
the addressee. The first subsection describes the ""bare"" imperative, which is520Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsactually the imperative proper. The following two subsections describe imperative uses of the subjunctive and the negative subjunctive (prohibitive).
Subjunctives can also be used with first and third person subjects. This
""hortative"" use is described in the final subsection of this section.","[541, 542, 543]"
"10.2. D e t r a n s i t i v i z a t i o n
As shown in chapter 4 above, verbs in Supyire can be broadly categorized
into transitive and intransitive, according to whether they ordinarily take a
direct object or not. The use of the word ""ordinarily"" should alert the reader
to the fact that there are exceptions, and it is precisely with these exceptional
cases that this chapter is concerned. The exceptions are of two sorts: intransitive verbs which occur in transitive clauses, and transitive verbs which
occur in intransitive clauses. The latter form the topic of this section.
There are two major types of detransitivization in Supyire. The first, the
passive, is accomplished through the suppression of the agent, for pragmatic
reasons. The remaining patient (or some other participant) is then made
subject. The other type of detransitivization may be called ""antipassive"" because it involves the suppression or ""demotion"" of the patient. It may in turn
be classified into two types. The first involves the simple suppression of the
patient/direct object of certain verbs. This suppression, like that of the agent
in the passive, is done mainly for pragmatic reasons. The second type of
""antipassive"" detransitivization is in contrast done mainly for semantic reasons, and involves the ""demotion"" of the patient to an indirect object role.",[424]
"6.6. Reduplicated verb modifying phrases
A modifying phrase consisting of a reduplicated verb together with a genitive noun possessor may precede a head noun. The whole noun phrase is
thus a type of nominalized clause. The head noun corresponds semantically
to either a nuclear (e.g. agent) or peripheral (e.g. instrument, circumstance)
participant of the finite clause. The possessor noun preceding the reduplicated verb corresponds in general to the absolutive argument of the verb,6.6. Reduplicated verb modifying phrases231that is, the subject/agent of an intransitive verb, and the direct object/patient
of a transitive verb. The reduplicated verb itself behaves tonally as if it were
a noun rather than a verb, but it does not take a noun class suffix. Although
it is written separately in the orthography, it is perhaps better thought of as
forming a compound with the following (head) noun. Nothing may intervene
between the reduplicated verb and the head noun.
In the following examples, the head noun represents an accompanying circumstance: the noise produced in the event. The verb is intransitive, and the
genitive noun consequently corresponds to the subject/agent. Note that a
time word may intervene between the genitive noun and the verb, as in

"708Notes: Chapter 410. There is some variation in tonal behavior among the three classes of
roots which take -re. As indicated here, those with medial /l/ behave
like other strong Mid verbs. Strong Mid verbs with medial /h/ [?], however, remain strong Mid in the imperfective. If they have an alternate
form, it usually is Low in the regular pattern: paha 'open wide', pare
'open wide.IMPFV', alternate form pähägd 'open wide.IMPFV'. There
is a disproportionate number of strong Mid verbs in this group (seven of
a total of thirteen). None of the verbs with medial /g/ has strong Mid
tone.
11. As with the change from strong Mid to Low (see previous note), there is
variation among the root-types which take this suffix. Those with medial /l/, of which a disproportionate number have a Low tune (fourteen
of seventeen), do not have any examples of the switch to High in the
imperfective. The switch seems to be obligatory, however, for roots
with medial /h/ [?] and /g/ [R]: mähä 'do all over the place 1 (used as a
final verb in a serial construction), ηιέτέ'άο all over the place.IMPFV'.
Other /g/-medial verbs act like nügd.
12. The L tone on the initial syllable of the verb has spread from the auxiliary through the pronoun and is not an indication of transitivity in any
way.
13. There is no evidence for this verb of a root final nasal. The imperfective
form is tuu/ithe adjective of gender 1 singular is nintorowo, and so
forth. Why it should have the nasal form of the causative suffix is therefore a mystery.
14. The Supyire color system of three basic terms might be better translated
'light colored' (instead of 'white'), 'warm colored' (instead of 'red'),
and 'dark colored' (instead o f ' b l a c k ' ) .
15. The switch from low to high tone in the derivation of this verb and others in this example seems to be regular and is not confined to forms
with the -#Ksuffix only. Thus kürülö 'roll up a long object' comes from
kürü 'fold, roll up a short object'. There are two exceptions, however:
nähänä 'drive animals in order to capture them' is the intensive of nähä
'herd', and mähänä 'go round in a circle' may derive from mähä 'do all
over the place' (used only as the second verb in a serial verb construction).
16. The possessed noun may be referential indefinite, but in that case the
definite form of the noun is used, followed by the indefinite determiner:
m)i pyä-qiwä
my child-DEF(GlS) IND(GIS)
'one of my children'17. The definite form funrjke is also possible in this construction.","[730, 731]"
"731guages (with an auxiliary between the subject and direct object), gapping is an ideal strategy for direct object, but not at all for subject.
Ordinarily a direct object consisting of a simple anaphoric pronoun
should take the (floating) low tone of the perfect auxiliary. The reasons
why it does not do so in this example (and a handful of others) are unclear, but probably have something to do with the exclamatory nature of
the utterance.
The basic meaning of wyere (definite wyeire) is 'leaves'. Herbalist
practices have led to the extension of the word to cover both 'medicine'
and 'poison', as here.
Lakyärä is borrowed from Bambara lakari 'antidote'.
Säsä is an intensifier that occurs only with ηά/ηέ 'now'. The combination means 'right now', 'this instant'. Its use by the speaker of the example is an exaggeration, since the person referred to had died several
months previously.
The high tone on the subject pronoun is also found in the realis (high
tone) complement clause type (see chapter 11, section 11.3). The highlow tune on the identifier pronoun is surprising, since normally these
pronouns, which have a strong mid basic tune, simply allow a preceding
high to spread onto them, wiping out the mid tone. The source of the final low remains unexplained at present.
The genitive particle in a few cases is not used for focus as in the above
examples, but to show that a genitive construction is intended in certain
cases where there could be another interpretation. Thus, since sometimes adjectives can be used substantially, occasionally the combination noun + adjective could actually be intended to be genitive + noun.
The following phrase could thus have the two meanings indicated:
Dähä nin-jwogi
Daha ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
a. 'Daha taken' (e.g. in Ί saw Daha taken from the room.')
b. 'Daha's taking' i.e. his salary
The use of the genitive particle unambiguously forces the second interpretation, but does not necessarily indicate any focus on the genitive
noun:
Dähä ' ύ
nin-jwoiji
Daha GEN ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
'Daha's salary'
A difficulty of another sort arises in participial nominalizations in which
the deverbal adjective is accompanied by an adpositional phrase. Since
the adpositional phrase intervenes between the genitive and its head, the732Notes: Chapter 13
only way to show that a genitive construction is intended is to insert the
genitive particle in front of the head noun:
pddrji
nu-vworogi
lwoh6
e
catfish.DEF ADJ-come.out.DEF water.DEF from
υ
tunmp6
GEN noise.DEF
'the noise of the catfish coming out of the water'Here again there is no hint of any kind of special focus. A possible explanation of the distribution of functions of the genitive particle may be
that it was formerly used in all genitive constructions, but was subsequently lost in ordinary genitives. It was retained in those cases where it
was necessary to indicate that a genitive construction was intended, and
also in those cases where there was a special focus (accompanied by intonational stress) on the possessor noun phrase.

"Negative constituent questions are marked with the same negative interrogative clause final marker (/ni/i) as negative yes/no questions. However,
instead of replacing the positive marker, as in yes/no questions, the negative
marker is placed in front of the other interrogative particle. The set of nonparticipants in a specific event is of course infinite. This means that the
pragmatic situations in which a speaker would want information on the
identity of a specific non-participant are rather rare. It is often of practical
use to know why an event did not take place, however, and so negative reason questions like the following are not uncommon:

Q14.2.2.2.jö 'who, whom, whose'
Jö (or jö) is borrowed from Bambara jon 'who'. It is sometimes combined
with the Supyire root foo 'owner, person in charge' (see chapter 3, section
3.2.2.9), which takes a low tone in this context: jöfbö. The use of jö or jöfbd
indicates that the speaker believes the referent he or she is asking the identity of is a human being. Jö is accordingly treated as being gender 1 singular
for the purposes of agreement. Thus when it is the subject which is questioned, a gender 1 singular place-holding pronoun must immediately follow
the question word:
(42) Jd

who he PAST PROG FUT FP-sit
'Who would have succeeded
ΒAm be me k66ge

Babemba inheritance.DEF on Q
Babemba (lit. sat on Babemba's inheritance)?'
Jd, like all other pronouns in Supyire, is not marked for case in any way:
the same form is used for subject, direct object, indirect object, and genitive:
(43) a. subject, indirect object

"5.6. Tense, aspect, and modality auxiliaries
In common with other Senufo languages, Supyire has a class of auxiliaries
marking tense, aspect, and modality. These are placed following the subject,
and preceding the direct object if there is one. Most of them cannot be described as auxiliary verbs, since they do not retain the ability to act as the
main verb in any clause. Most if not all of them are derived historically from
verbs, however. The most common auxiliaries are given in Table 23. For descriptions of their function, and possibilities of combination, see chapter 9.
As can be seen, most of the auxiliaries in Table 23 are very small, consisting of one syllable only. Many of them in addition suffer varying degrees of
phonological erosion as they are cliticized onto the preceding subject noun
phrase.
All five of the copulas (jiye 'be', mpyi 'be (Past)', sii 'be (Emphatic)',
nähä 'be here', and wä 'be there') are used as supplementary auxiliaries in
various constructions. The verbs pa 'come' and sa 'go' have also developed
quasi-auxiliary functions.",[200]
