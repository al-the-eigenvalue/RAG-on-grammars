"11.1. Word order
Kakua has a predominant preference for an (S)OV order of constituents,
where the subject NP can be omitted under certain semantic and discourse conditions
(These conditions are discussed in Chapter 6 on case marking and grammatical
relations, and include animacy and accessibility.) Additionally, subject arguments
can be indexed on the predicate by means of cross-referencing proclitics that agree
in person and number with the subject argument, and gender for 3rd person singular
subject arguments. A detailed discussion of the criteria governing the omission or
full expression of subject argument NPs and cross-referencing proclitics is given in
Chapter 6.
Whenever overtly expressed, the subject argument most frequently precedes
both the object(s) argument(s) and the verb. The verb is predominantly in final
position. The following examples illustrate this preferred SOV order of constituents.
An SV intransitive clause is illustrated in (1), an example in which the subject NP
of a transitive clause is omitted (OV) is illustrated in (2), and sentences with subject,
object, and verb are illustrated in (3)-(5):mi=ʔèh-ep=be=buh

Alternatively, other orders are also accepted. However, when these occur,
they tend to be stricter as regards the morphological encoding of arguments. An OSV
order, for example, tends to favour the overt marking of case on the object argument,
and preferably also the overt expression of the subject cross-referencing proclitic on
the predicate:
6) jegêʔ=diʔ fǐt

‘we sewed clothes’fĩ=waj ̀=na1PL=pull=DECLThe least accepted order seems to be VSO, followed by OVS. The latter was
accepted by speakers if the information given was visually witnessed, but even in
these cases it was considered as a rather odd order. The scale from most accepted to
least accepted, or from most preferred to least preferred (and least frequent) orders
conforms to the following scale. All of these orders are attested in naturally occurring
texts and elicitation:
Figure 11.1 Acceptability scale of order of constituents in Kakuamost preferred
SOV >OSVleast preferred>OVS>SVO>VSO>VOSThe scale above shows that orders towards the least preferred end of the scale
are those in which the object argument follows the verb and the verb is not in final
position. Kakua’s preferred order, thus, can be described as basically OV.
The scale shown above is based on general impressions of both texts and
elicitation. A more accurate description of these alternate orders would require a
quantitative approach of the occurrence of each of these orders throughout the
corpus.
Clauses with adjuncts tend to place the adjunct immediately after the subject
of the clause. Other orders, however, are also found. The most common linear order
of constituents in a clause with an adjunct follows the template below:Alignment and word order307Figure 11.2 Most typical constituent order in clauses with adjuncts

Examples (7)-(9) below illustrate intransitive (7), transitive (8), and
ditransitive clauses (9) with adjuncts. Note that in all cases the adjunct (highlighted
in boldface) follows the subject NP.

Despite the preferred SOV constituent order, the object NP may also precede
the subject NP. This often occurs when the object argument is being emphasized in
discourse, resulting in an OSV order:

The alignment system in Kakua conforms to the prototypical nominativeaccusative type, whereby the intransitive subject and the most agentive argument of
a transitive clause are expressed in the same way, but different from the least
agentive argument of a transitive clause: A=S≠O. Because intransitive subjects (S)
and the most agentive arguments of transitive clauses (A) are treated equally in
Kakua, I refer to both as ‘subjects’. Subject arguments are not morphologically
marked by case. Cross-referencing proclitics attach to the verb and agree in person
and number with the subject arguments of the clause. All other arguments (i.e.,
arguments functioning in any role different from subject) are morphologically
marked for case, if the requirements for differential object marking are met (see
Chapter 6). Alignment of object arguments is neutral, meaning that object arguments308A Grammar of Kakuain the semantic roles of patients, themes, and recipients are all encoded in the same
way: P=T=R (see Chapter 6).
The morphological marking of arguments in Kakua shows both head and
dependent marking (in terms of Nichols 1986). While subject arguments are headmarked (morphologically indexed on the predicate), object arguments are dependentmarked by morphological case markers on the object NPs.
The remainder of this chapter is divided into two parts. Section §11.3 focuses
specifically on the alignment of subjects, while section §11.4 describes the alignment
of objects. A summary is given in §11.5, listing the most relevant information
regarding alignment in Kakua.","[326, 327, 328, 329]"
"11.5 Summary
The word order and alignment of arguments in Kakua can be summarized as
follows:
 Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
Alternative orders follow a preferentiality scale, from most preferred SOV to
least preferred (but attested with restrictions) VOS.
 Most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.
 The coding of subject arguments is of the head-marking type.
 Subject arguments are not morphologically marked for case.
 Kakua A arguments and S arguments are not different morphosyntactically. This
conforms to a typical nominative-accusative type of alignment, where A and S
arguments are equal, while different from P arguments: A=S≠P.",[334]
"Alignment and word order309Compare this to the construction in (14), where the clause is formed by a single
predicate with the proclitic wã= ‘1SG’, indexing the subject argument of this
intransitive clause:
13) kǎn
ʔã=ʔêw=na=ka
3SG.M
3SG.M=sing=DECL=ASS
‘he is singing’
14) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
‘I’m always afraid’
Subject arguments can express the semantic roles of agents or experiencers.
Examples (15) and (16) show subject arguments of stative verbs in which the subject
arguments have the semantic role of ‘patient’, a prototypical semantic role of subjects
of stative verbs:
15) wěm
wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-weʔe-kan=be
1SG
1SG=HABT-know-NEG=REC.PST
‘I used to know’
16) wěm
bɨ
wã=tʃù-fwɨʔɨ
1sg
today
1SG=rest-TEL.PROG
‘I am, today, still resting’
Subjects of intransitive verbs of motion or active verbs prototypically have
the semantic role of agent. This is illustrated in example (17) below:
17) kǎn
ʔã=t-fwɨ ̂b-ʔǎb-beh=na
3SG.M
3SG.M=EVID-follow-go.up-go=DECL
‘he went back up again’
Finally, subjects of intransitive clauses involving verbs of mental or emotional
processes (or verbs of perception) prototypically have the semantic role of
experiencers. Examples (18)-(20) below give an illustration of these types of clauses
in Kakua:
18) kǎnʔ
mi=pĩ-tîk=na=ka
3SG.F
3SG.F=HAB-be.embarrassed=DECL=ASS
‘she is usually embarrassed’
19) wěm

be.big 1SG=be.sad=REM.PST
‘I was very sad/very sorry’310A Grammar of Kakua20) ʧej-bit
kět
ʔĩ=t-wɨ ̂ʔi=dê=ka
night-other 3PL
3PL=EVID-be.surprised=INF.FUT.EVID=ASS
‘they might be surprised tomorrow’
Examples (12)-(20) above illustrate the expression of subject arguments in
intransitive clauses, showing that, although the subject noun phrase does not receive
morphological marking to indicate its grammatical function (i.e. no subject case
marker), the verb usually takes a cross-referencing proclitic encoding person and
number properties of the subject argument.
The expression of subject arguments in transitive clauses is illustrated in
examples (21)-(22), which show that the subject arguments are morphologically and
syntactically expressed in the same way as the subject arguments in the intransitive
clauses presented in (11)-(20) above. In (21) the subject argument expressed by the
NP wã=ʔibi ‘my uncle’ is the instigator of the action expressed by the transitive
verb tɨh ‘kill with blowgun’ performed on an object argument with the semantic role
of patient, which is morphologically marked with the object case marker =diʔ:
21) wã=ʔibi
wɨbɨ=diʔ
1SG=uncle bird.sp=OBJʔã=t-tɨh=na=tagǎ3SG.M=EVID-kill.with.blowgun=DECL=INF.EVIDtʃãhãpPROG‘my uncle must be hunting Curassow (bird.sp)’
Example (22) shows a similar type of clause, where the subject argument is
expressed both by the NP hiw ‘jaguar’, and indexed on the predicate with the
proclitic ‘3SG.M’, agreeing in person, number and gender with the subject argument:
22) hiw
mɨhiw=diʔ
ʔã=t-tʃãk=na=wɨt=be
jaguar dog=OBJ
3SG.M=EVID-bite=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
‘the jaguar bit the dog, it is said’
The syntactic position of subject arguments in intransitive and transitive
clauses is preferably sentence-initial (see above). Additional examples are given in
(23)-(24), displaying constructions involving verbs of perception or mental
processes. In (23) the subject is a lexical noun cross-referenced on the verb by the
proclitic ʔã= ‘3SG.M’. In (24) the subject argument is a pronoun and is also crossreferenced on the verb:
S

through an NP, but indexed on the predicate of the clause only. In this case the
resulting constituent order is O s=V. Example (26) further illustrates the same order,
where the noun wãp ‘white capuchin’ is the object of the verb fwãʔ ‘find’, and the
subject is expressed by the proclitic fwĩ= ‘1PL’:

‘we met the (evil spirit) white capuchin’11.4 Object alignment
Kakua marks its object arguments with the case marker enclitic =diʔ on the
object NP, i.e. a dependent-marking strategy, in terms of Nichols (1986). Unlike
subject arguments, object arguments are not indexed on the verb. Examples (27)(28) below illustrate object case marking:
27) měm=be
2SG=REC.PST
‘you taught me’wěm=diʔ1SG= OBJ28) wěm

different semantic roles.1 This is examplified in (29)-(32). (See further discussion on
semantic roles and object marking in Chapter 6). Example (29) shows an object
1See the comment in Chapter 6 regarding the possibility that the object marker =diɁ might haveother functions than marking object arguments, as it also occurs on noun phrases expressing source/goal,
as well as on other NPs that are not core arguments.","[329, 330, 331, 332]"

not contain TAME marking. If the reportative evidential is used, it does not attach
to the predicate together with the negative imperative, but it rather occurs forms
another clause (as in (107) above), and (110) below. The use of a reportative
construction seems to serve a function of making the command more ‘soft’, or more
polite:

‘Katherine, don’t push them! they have said’
As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).
12.13 Responding to imperatives
Responses to imperative clauses are constructed like responses to questions
(described in §12.10 above under interrogative polar and content questions).
̃̂ ‘yes’, or
Commands are usually responded to with the particle (interjection) hɨhɨ
another particle with affirmative meaning (see Chapter 3 for a list of particles and
interjections in Kakua), such as da! ‘thereǃ’, among others. Additionally (as with
questions), imperatives can be responded to by repeating the predicate of the
imperative clause in a declarative construction. Example in (111) below illustrates a
response to a command:Basic clause structure and types of clauses341waj-kan=héʔ

Negative responses to a command are also constructed like negative responses

12.14 Summary
This chapter describes the basic clause structure in Kakua. A minimal clause
contains at least one predicate. Given that cross-referencing proclitics can stand for
the subject NP of the clause, the overt expression of the subject NP is not obligatory
in order to form a clause. In basic clauses involving predicates with semantically
transitive verb roots, the object argument NP generally precedes the predicate of the
clause. Most other clause types also prefer the basic SOV order of constituents. An
exception to this is the imperative clause, which prefers an OSV order.
The basic clause structures of copula constructions (affirmative and negative
copular clauses), predicative possessive clauses, comparatives, verbless clauses, and
basic locative clauses were described in sections §12.2 to §12.7 respectively. It was
also shown that nonverbal clauses represent a common strategy in Kakua to express
equative copular meanings.
This chapter ended with a description of the structure and coding of
declarative, interrogative and imperative (both affirmative and negative) clauses in
§12.10 and §12.11. Kakua declarative clauses represent the default type of clause.
Additionally, there is a morpheme which expresses an imperative mood for
when the request is to perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The origin
of this morpheme is obscure, and a diachronic explanation is still to be found in
order to have a more accurate approach to analyze the form. Future research,342A Grammar of Kakuaincluding perhaps a comparative analysis between Kakua, Nɨkak and other
neighboring languages, will undoubtedly presents us with fascinating hypotheses on
the origin of this form.","[360, 361, 362, 363]"
"Introduction: Kakua and its speakers3The morphology of Kakua is highly agglutinative (especially in its verbal
morphology), with a combination of head and dependent marking. The language is
predominantly suffixing, with a few prefixes occurring exclusively on the verb.
Kakua has cross-referencing proclitics that agree in person and number with the
Subject/Agent argument of the clause. Third person singular referents have,
additionally, gender agreement of feminine or masculine. Roots are often
compounded to form new words.
Parts of speech in Kakua can be divided into open classes (nouns and verbs),
and closed classes (adjectives, adverbs, numerals, interjections, and other particles).
Kakua nominal categories include number, classifiers, diminutive and
augmentative distinctions, and case marking. Nominalization is a highly productive
strategy to derive nouns from verbs. Animacy is particularly relevant for the system
of differential object marking and differential number marking. There are no
prefixing positions in the noun template, unless additional derivational processes
have been applied (Chapter 4).
Nouns can be further subdivided into alienable and inalienable classes, as
is evident from the system of possession marking (Chapter 5).
Most of Kakua morphology occurs in the verbal construction. There, prefixes,
suffixes and enclitics encode all of the tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality (TAME)
distinctions (clitics conveying TAME distinctions can also occur on other word
classes). Likewise, valency changing morphemes, verbal negation, cross-referencing
proclitics, and many markers of discourse also occur in the verb construction. Verb
roots can group together in a very productive grammatical strategy of verb
serialization.
Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other
orders are also allowed. It has a nominative-accusative alignment system.","[24, 25]"
"116A Grammar of KakuaIn Kakua, most attributive or quality meanings are expressed through
descriptive verbs. A small set of words which are not verbs and can be used directly
in attributive modification, however, can be identified.
The small set of adjectives in Kakua is formed by a total of four adjectives.
Morphologically, these words can take both verb and noun morphology.
Syntactically, the adjective words have a fairly free order and the modifier can occur
either preceding or following the modified noun.
The adjectives have a likely etymology in verbs, as discussed at the end of
this section. The four Kakua adjectives are given in (53) belowː
53) hàphâp
bɨdǐ
jehěp‘tall/up’
‘new’
‘big’
‘bad’All other qualities or attributive meanings in the language are expressed by
descriptive verbs. When a descriptive verb is used for expressing an attribute or
quality, the verb root is marked with the adjectivizer morpheme –ni following the
modified noun in juxtaposition.
The class of adjectives is distinct from verbs and nouns. Unlike verbs,
adjectives can occur as free morphemes without the need of derivational morphology
to function as modifiers of nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives can take all of the verbal
morphology, and may function as heads of verb phrases.
The syntactic position of the four adjective words in Kakua is apparently not
fixed, and whereas some speakers prefer an N Adj order, others have no clear
preference for either one, accepting both as being just as good. It must be said,
however, that allowing for either order to occur is much more common in elicitations
than in natural texts, where the modifier tends to follow the modified noun. This
might be explained in that the four adjectives in Kakua have an etymological source
in verbs, and Kakua is predominantly a verb-final language.
The examples in (54) and (55) below illustrates a case in which the same
speaker uses indistinctly both Adj N and N Adj orders in the same narrative text:

When descriptive verbs function as attributive modifiers, they are adjectivized
by the adjectivizer suffix –ni.
The following examples in (59) and (60) below illustrate this adjectival
function of descriptive verbs. Note also the order of constituents where the predicate
remains in final position whereas the adjectivized verb precedes the verb phrase.

regional languages (see also nominalization via compounding of classifiers to verbs described in chapter4), these adjectives can also occur as head of a NP without the classifiers, as can be seen in example (4)above.","[137, 138, 139]"

object argument conditioning DOM in Kakua, showing that object marking is
obligatory on noun phrases with human referents (and a few others). Other features
given by Creissels in the list above, such as formal properties of the noun phrase, or
semantic transitivity of verbal lexemes and their relation with obligatory marking
(c.f., Hopper & Thompson 1980:259, 272; von Heusinger & Niyazmetowa 2008),
are not considered here, but will need further study. Another factor favouring the
overt marking of object case appears to be word order, where OSV order tends to
favour the overt marking of case on the object argument (see Chapter 11, §11.1).
The criteria conditioning DOM presented here for Kakua should be further
investigated in future research, and many questions remain unanswered for this
version of the description on the grammar of Kakua. Issues regarding topicality, for
example, and the interaction between definiteness and specificity, call for a detailed
study.
This section is subdivided as follows: animacy and DOM in Kakua are
presented in §6.3.1-§6.3.6 while section §6.3.7 describes DOM and definiteness.

Kakua (namely definiteness) is given in §6.3.7 below. Future research should be

Types of morphemes and word classes
3.0IntroductionThis chapter presents an overview of the major word classes in Kakua. These
are divided into open classes and closed classes of words. The defining grammatical
features of these word classes are established by syntactic, semantic, and
morphological criteria. The word classes in Kakua include nouns, verbs, a small set
of adjectives, a small group of adverbs, a group of particles, and a large number of
grammatical, bound morphemes.
The intricateness of Kakua’s grammar is due, for the most part, to its
morphological complexity. Kakua morphology is highly affixing; most affixes are
post-stem (suffixes), as is characteristic of the languages spoken in the Vaupés
linguistic area (c.f., Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999, Payne 1990, Aikhenvald 2002b,
2012). Prefixing occurs in the verb phrase only and the number of prefixes in Kakua
is far less than that of suffixes (see Chapter 8). Compounding in Kakua occurs very
productively as a strategy of derivation, possession, or as a strategy to form new
(lexical) meanings.
The verb morphology in Kakua is by far more complex than the morphology
of nouns, regarding both inflection and derivation (cf., Chapter 8). A detailed
discussion of inflection and word class-changing derivational processes related to a
specific part of speech can be found in later chapters where for each part a thorough
description is given.
Kakua syntax, on the other hand, is more simple and straightforward. The
preferred order is SOV, although alternative orders are often allowed (see Chapter
12).
The word in Kakua consists of roots (at least one is obligatory) plus other
optional elements such as prefixes, a large number of derivational and inflectional
suffixes, and other formatives, such as clitics. Some discourse-related morphemes,
namely particles serving as intensifiers, or adverbial particles, also cliticize to
preceding hosts. For an overview of the definition of the Kakua word see Section
§3.1 below.
The first aim of the present chapter is to offer an overview of the main types
of morphemes of Kakua. Note that this chapter provides only a basic description of
the main concepts that help define Kakua’s parts of speech and different
morphological categories. Secondly, this chapter describes Kakua’s open and closed
word classes. Open and closed word classes in Kakua differ in that open word classes
admit new items, whereas the closed classes, on the other hand, strongly resist the
introduction of new items.","[115, 116, 117]"
"Basic clause structure and types of clauses337Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:
97) mi=Ɂên-é
3SG.F=see=IMP
‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
3SG.F=work=IMP
‘may she work!’
Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:
99) kan=diʔ měm
3SG=OBJ 2SG
‘leave it!’ma= fwẽh-é2SG=leave-IMP100) bab-ni=diʔ
be.white-ADJVZ=OBJ
‘sift the manioc drink!’měm101) wã=pebʔ

1SG=be.near
2SG
‘you come stand by me!’ma=ɲɨʔ-hɨwʔ-ɨ ̃́2SGma=dúk-ú2SG=sift-IMP2SG=stand-come-IMPThe only evidentiality marker that can occur in combination with imperative
clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:338A Grammar of Kakua102) ma=tʃɨd-ɨ ̃́,

2SG=take.out-IMP grate-NMLZ
POT
‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’nih=wɨt=hĩsay=REP.EVID=REM.PSTIn fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.
104) ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ
nih-áʔbuhú

say-IMP2
‘(she) is recording, (you) tell her!’
105) kǎn=diʔ ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
6Basic clause structure and types of clauses33912.12 Negative imperative
Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :
106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
‘don’t be afraid!’of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:
(i)
ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ
nih-áʔbuhú
take.out=DECL=ASS=D.S
say-IMP2
‘(she) is recording, tell her!’
(ii)
kǎn=diʔ
ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
3SGM=OBJ
take.out-IMP2
‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicatedmarker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possiblesource for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complexbenefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.","[357, 358, 359, 360]"

‘he loves his daughter’ʔã=ʔûj3SG.M=care.aboutKakua treats all object arguments in the same way, including when two or
more objects co-occur in di-transitive constructions, both in terms of the use of the
object case marker =diʔ and the differential object marking that applies to it.
An example of a ditransitive construction is given in (33) below. This example
exhibits a typical ditransitive Kakua verb wɨʔ̃ ̌ ‘give’, exhibiting an agent-like subject
argument, and two objects, one of which is in a recipient (R) role, Gabí ‘Gabriel’,
and the other, dâwa-daʔ ‘ball-CL:round’ is in a theme (T) role. Two things are
important to note here. Firstly, note that all object arguments are marked with the
object case marker =diʔ. Secondly, note that all arguments occur before the verb:
SOOV.

Gabí=diʔ ʔã=wɨ ̃ʔ=na=be
Edgar rubber-CL:round=OBJ Gabriel=OBJ 3SG.M=give=DECL=REC.PST
‘Edgar gave a ball to Gabriel’
Example (34) illustrates the ditransitive verb ʔɨ ̀b ‘bring’, taking two object
arguments (kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ and tũj ‘manioc’), and an adjunct (waptʃi ‘manioc field’):
34) kǎnʔ=diʔ waptʃi=na=bǔ=diʔ

‘they brought her manioc from the manioc field, it is said’Alignment and word order313With respect to example (34) note, firstly, that the adjunct takes both the
locative case marker =bǔ and the object case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’ (see Chapter 6).
Secondly, note that the adjunct precedes the verb. Additionally, note that the adjunct
occurs in between the two object arguments of the clause. This may be related to the
fact that there is no overt subject NP in this example. This example thus suggests
that Kakua prefers to place the adjunct preceding the verb, but not in clause-initial
position, adjuncts thus ending up in the second position within the clause. The
preferred ordering of constituents in clauses with adjuncts would then be as follows:
S[ADJUNCT]OV, or O[ADJUNCT]V, the second ordering being preferred whenever the
subject NP is absent.
Examples (33)-(34) also show that all arguments functioning as objects are
marked by the morpheme =diʔ, regardless of their semantic roles. In other words,
object arguments in the semantic roles of patient (P), theme (T), goals/recipients (R),
are all encoded by the same morpheme. As described in Chapter 6, the order of
object noun phrases encoding T, P or R is also free. The alignment of object
arguments is thus neutral (as in Croft 2003; Haspelmath 2005; Dryer 2007;
Malchukov et. al 2010).

TRThis type of alignment responds to the functional principles of economy, in
that one single marker is sufficient for the coding of all three arguments types (c.f.,
Malchukov et. al 2010:4).","[332, 333, 334]"

Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0IntroductionKakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"A Grammar of Kakua192followed in order to establish other possible correlations between DOM and other
areas of the grammar6.1.1DOM and animacyThe oligatoriness of object marker in Kakua responds to the animacy of the
noun phrase in object function. Object marking is obligatory on all noun phrases
with human referents. On other object noun phrases, object marking is obligatory if
the object noun phrase is higher on the animacy hierarchy than the subject noun
phrase. Otherwise, the overt marking of object case is optional, and may be favored
by definiteness.
Object marking and its conditioning by animacy is a relatively common crosslinguistic phenomenon and in fact seems to have been the most widely explored
conditioning feature for differential object marking across languages, c.f., Comrie
(1989) for references in a broader typological view of DOM; Bossong (1980, 1991,
1998) for Romance, Turkic, some Indo-European languages, and languages of
Australia; Blake (2001) for some aspects of DOM in Hindi; England (1996) for
Mayan languages; for languages of the Vaupés see Aikhenvald (2003, 2012); Zúñiga
(2007), and Epps (2008); Comrie (2008) makes reference to alignment of case
marking in a typological perspective; Campbell & Grondona (2012) for languages
of the Chaco and the southern cone; and O’Connor & Muysken (2014) and Birchall
(2014) for an overview of languages of South America.
From these studies, we know that the higher the animacy of the object noun
within the hierarchy, the more likely it is that its marking will be obligatory. The
hierarchy governing this is reproduced below from Silverstein 1976 (see also Comrie
1989, and Croft 1991 for more discussion on animacy hierarchies):4
1 > 2 > 3 > Human > Animate > Inanimate
The rationale behind this is that entities lower on the animacy hierarchy are
very likely to be patients and thus objects therefore do not need to be overtly marked
as such. For instance, nouns referring to human entities are typically agents, whereas
inanimate nouns are typically patients. This disambiguates between agents and
patients in many cases. However, ambiguity can occur when two (or more)
arguments within a clause have potentially the same animacy and thus the possibility
to be agents, e.g. when the object argument has a human referent. This is the reason
why nouns referring to humans when functioning as the object(s) argument(s) of the
clause are obligatorily marked, also in Kakua.
DOM in Kakua conforms to this animacy hierarchy. All noun phrases with
human referents, including pronouns and demonstratives with human referents, are
obligatorily marked when in object function (demonstratives are obligatorily marked
also for a different reason, namely because they are definite, a pragmatic criterion
that favours the overt marking of object case; see §6.3.7 below). Nouns referring to
4Comrie (1989) notes also that pronouns do not really relate to animacy, but to referentiality.","[213, 214]"
"236A Grammar of KakuaPhonologically, the characteristics of verb roots are not unique to the class of
verbs (see the description of the defining characteristics of the different parts of
speech in Chapter 3). Verb roots, as roots in the language as a whole, must be
minimally monosyllabic, and maximally bisyllabic. Roots bear lexical tone, and all
of Kakua’s tonal inventory is exhibited in verb roots (as shown in 1 below):
1) jùjjûj
jǔj‘have diarrea’
‘massage while praying’
‘be dripping’Although a verb word may be composed of several roots (see Chapter 9 for verb
compounding and serialization), and these roots may present different tonal values,
the verb word as a whole has a characteristic intonation, with a high pitch at the
beginning of the word that gradually falls towards the end of the word. Thus, if a
verb word is composed of more than one root, the highest tone pitch for the second
root is invariably lower than the highest tone pitch of the first root (this is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2 on Kakua phonology regarding downdrift).
Verb roots are also lexically specified for nasality or orality, as another general
characteristic of Kakua roots that is not unique to verb roots. As briefly introduced
in Chapter 2, verbs are distinguished from nouns primarily on semantic and
morphosyntactic grounds, rather than phonological (see the overview in Chapter 2
on the parts of speech and their basic characteristics).
Semantically, verbs roots refer to actions (e.g., ʧaǩ̃ ‘bite’), processes (e.g.,
mǒp ‘to rot’), and temporal or permanent states (e.g., paʔ ‘be.like’; hěp ‘be.jealous’).
In other words, Kakua verbs prototypically express relations that are anchored in
time, processes or actions, or more general atemporal states of being such as dɨ ̀ ‘be
red’, nɨmʔ ‘be below’, etc. States denoting inherent or temporal properties are usually
expressed by descriptive verbs. The verb word may function as the predicate of the
clause.
Related to its characteristic of being a heavily agglutinative language, Kakua
verb roots tend to encode only one relatively simple meaning each, while complex
meanings are created by combining various verb roots (see discussion in §8.3 below
for each of these verbal morphemes).
Syntactically, the predicate tends to be the last constituent of the clause
(SOV). It is, thus, easy to recognize the verb word within a clause: it is the
morphologically most complex word, and the one that normally occurs in the last
syntactic position of the clause. The verb word by itself can also be sufficient both
as the predicate and as the only constituent of the clause, as is further discussed in
Chapter 11 on clause structure. Two examples are given in (2) and (3) below.
Example (2) illustrates the predicate occurring in its most typical final position.
Example (3) illustrates the predicate as sufficient to function as a clause in itself:The verb: morphology and structure

section will first address the semantics of verbs with regard to transitivity; after these
transitivity distinctions have been addressed, this section will describe the different
types of verbs with regard to other semantic features, specifically the semantic
subclasses of verbs, such as descriptive, stative, positional, and motion verbs. Other
verbal constructions and their semantics, such as verb serialization and
compounding, are dealt with in Chapter 9.
With regard to transitivity, verb roots can be identified as being inherently
intransitive or transitive (mono- or ditransitive) verbs, judging by the number of
arguments that they can take. This distinction, however, is not very straightforward
and the lexical transitivity of verb roots is often difficult to establish. This is because
arguments do not have to be overtly expressed whenever these arguments have been
previously mentioned in the discourse. This applies particularly to the overt
expression of object arguments. Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb,
and only with restricted exceptions these are not overtly expressed. The rules
governing the optionality of cross-referencing subject proclitics are discussed in
Chapter 6.
Example (4) below illustrates this problematic classification of verbs roots
according to their lexical valency. The example is extracted from a conversation in
Kakua, shows a semantically transitive verb bɨ ́dʔ-tû ‘add.onto-hold.vertically’, where
the object argument is not expressed. However, since the argument to which the verb
is referring had been previously stated, the sentence is perfectly grammatical in
Kakua discourse:
4) bɨ ́dʔ-tû=ka=nit
add.onto-hold.vertically=ASS=S.Sʔã=t-hɨjbi-ɲɨʔ-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here-stop-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘he arrived and stopped, and held (the panflute) vertically (against his body)’238A Grammar of KakuaThe use of another semantically transitive verb with and without an overt
object noun phrase is illustrated in (5)-(6).
5)6)Teʔã=t-tʃúh=na=wɨt=bekǎnʔ=diʔʔĩ=t-tʃúh-up=wɨt=hĩTe
3SG.M=EVID-bathe=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
‘Te went to bathe (it is said)’
3SG.F=OBJ 3PL=EVID-bathe-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
‘they bathed her (it is said)’Example (7) illustrates the semantically ditransitive verb hɨ ̂t ‘show’. With this
verb also, not all arguments need to be overtly expressed. Here, only two overt
arguments occur: the proclitic for 3SG.M ʔã= referring to the subject argument of
the clause, and the object kǎn=diʔ referring to the indirect object (recipient)
‘shaman’. The direct object (theme), tɨb ‘pain’, is dropped since it had been
previously established in the discourse:
7)kǎn=diʔhɨ ̂dɁɨ=kaʔã=t-beh=tagǎ3SG.M=OBJ
show=ASS
3SG.M= EVID-go=INF.EVID
‘perhaps he went to show (his pain) to him (the shaman)’As discussed in Chapter 8, Kakua does not mark subject arguments with
morphological case, but rather they are indexed on the verb. Other arguments
(objects), receive the case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’. The marking of case for object
arguments, however, is governed by differential object marking rules (c.f., §8.3), and
thus, some arguments that function as objects may lack case markers. Therefore, the
presence or absence of object case markers on arguments is not a reliable indicator
of the transitivity of the root. Example (8) illustrates the verb ‘eat’ hěmʔ, where the
object argument is not morphologically marked for case, which is one of the formal
cues that help identify the valency of verb roots, here camouflaged by the absence
of such marker on the object argument:
8)Katerinetʃɨ ̂Katherine pineapple
‘Katherine eats pineapple’mi=hěmʔ=na=ka3SG.F=eat=DECL=ASSAs seen in the examples above, defining transitivity values of Kakua verbs is
complicated by the omission of arguments, on the one hand, and optionality of case
marking, on the other hand. Intransitive verbs can thus be identified as those that can
maximally take one (subject) argument, and no object arguments, while mono- and
ditransitive verbs can be identified as those that can take one or two object
arguments, keeping in mind that these do not need to be overtly expressed, and if
they are, they do not need to be marked for object case. Given the possible omissionThe verb: morphology and structure239of object arguments, mono- and ditransitive verbs can also be called ambitransitives,
i.e. verbs that may behave both like intransitive and transitive verbs.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261]"
"The verb: morphology and structure243Table 8.4 below further displays all of the morpheme slots of the verb word,
divided in numbered morphological positions corresponding to the relative order of
individual morphemes that can potentially co-occur. The numbering corresponds to
the order of verbal morphemes when moving from left to right in the verb word.
Those morphemes presented as occurring in the same slot are mutually exclusive,
but also some that are presented in different slots cannot co-occur because of
semantic incompatibility. For instance, of the evidentiality enclitics from slot 12,
only the reported evidential =wɨt can co-occur with the declarative mood marker
from slot 11 (see §16.8 and Chapter 13). Another such restriction is that evidentiality
enclitics from slot 12 cannot co-occur with the assertion marker from slot 14.
For these reasons, the templates presented in Tables 8.3 and 8.4 below are rather
idealized versions of what the verb word would look like. The forms presented in
8.4 represent a comprehensive list of the morphemes of the verb word; not all of
them can actually co-occur in a verb word.

occurs preceding the declarative marker as shown in example (14) below (which is
why it is listed in position 10 in Table 8.4 above). When the clause is marked for
reported evidentiality, the frustrative marker cannot occur preceding the reported
evidential marker =wɨt; rather, it must follow the marker as illustrated in (15) below,
and it functions as a clitic and not as a suffix (which is why it is given also as an
enclitic in position 13 on Table 8.4 above).","[264, 265, 266, 267]"
"9.3Order of verb roots in a SVCA further interesting aspect regarding the serialization of verb roots concerns
the order in which the verb roots occur within the SVC. It is known from other
languages that the sequencing of verb roots in a SVC tends to be tense-iconic (c.f.,
Haspelmath 2014:13; Diessel 2008; Aikhenvald 2006:16, 21, 28-29; Durie 1997:§4;
Givón 1991). Likewise, the verb roots of a SVC in Kakua are ordered in such a way
that the verb expressing the earlier event of the sequence is placed at the beginning
of the SVC and is then followed by verb roots expressing later events, in
chronological order. Example (19) below illustrates this:
19) ʔã=fwɨb-hɨ ̃wʔ-pàʔ-hɨ ̌j=na
3SG.M=return-come-float-arrive=DECL
‘he came back, floated and arrived’
In example (20) the crying of the child is presented as preceding the arrival, and
therefore the verb root hɨj̃ ̌ ‘cry’ precedes the verb root hɨjbi ‘arrive here’ in the SVC.
This does not imply that the TAME values are different for the roots involved in the
SVC. The TAME values have scope over all of the roots in the construction.

Many other functions and meanings of SVCs in Kakua remain to be further
explored in future research. In many other Vaupés languages, for example, in
addition to lexicalized SVCs and temporally iconic sequences of events, SVCs also
serve to express causative relations and simultaneous events. Furthermore,
Aikhenvald (2003, 2006:178-201) describes for Tariana (Arawak language spoken
in the Vaupés area) that certain orderings of the elements of a SVC appear to be noniconic with regard to temporality. Thus, the careful focus on SVCs in Kakua show a
promising, very fructiferous aspect of the language that should be further explored.",[284]

Objects with the semantic roles of recipient were already illustrated in

recipients, in addition to beneficiaries, and maleficiaries in both transitive and
ditransitive clauses.
If both objects of a ditransitive clauses have similar status in terms of animacy,
both usually are marked with the object case marker (see §0 below on differential
object marking criteria). Example (16) illustrates an argument in object function with
the semantic role of recipient. Note also that example (19) shows a source (location)
being marked with the object case marker, this is further discussed below:̃̌

If both object arguments are expressed by noun phrases and both are marked
with the object case marker =diʔ (independently of their semantic role), the order
of constituents is fairly free, and speakers will judge as acceptable various different
alternate orders. See the following example, which was recorded from a conversation
(22)a and posteriorly rearranged and presented to speakers during elicitation (22)b:
22) a) Ɲɨjʔ-idip
ʔEbebʔ=diʔ
mɨ ̀=diʔ

wild.pig=OBJ give
‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’

ʔEbebʔ=diʔ
wɨʔ̀
Opossum-bone wild.pig=OBJ Venom=OBJ
give
‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’
Both of these examples were judged by speakers to have the same meaning.
Both examples have two possible interpretations: ‘Opossum Bone gives wild pig to
Venom’ or ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’, where Opossum Bone and
Venom stand for proper names or nick names of two males, and wild pig refers to
an animal. This shows that the order of the two objects is free. In the case of example
(22), since the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’ is pragmaticallyArgument marking and case marking 191
odd, speakers usually interpret this sentence with the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives
wild pig to Venom’ even when both readings are acceptable.
Even though the ordering of objects is syntactically free, I have observed
when doing elicitation that speakers tend to more readily accept an order in which
the participant with a lower/less agentive-like semantic role is placed to the left of
the argument with higher/more agentive semantics.
In addition to arguments in patient, theme, recipient, beneficiary, and
maleficiary roles, the object marker also occurs on noun phrases with the role of goal
(see example (41) below), and source as in (19) above.","[210, 211, 212, 213]"

For temporal adverbial clauses, Kakua also uses bare verb roots (see §13.4
above) (note that this is a different strategy than verb serialization. See Chapter 9).
In addition to the verb pêa ‘finish’, other verbs with similar semantics can be used
in this function, e.g., běd ‘extinguish’ or pê ‘be.last’ (these verbs are non-finite, used
in their bare form, i.e., without any additional morphology). Examples (42)-(44)
illustrate the use of such verbs as temporal linkers between the adverbial clause and
the main clause. Note that, like complement and relative clauses, the adverbial
subordinate clause precedes the main clause being modified. Note also that the verb
does not necessarily need to be a bare verb root in order to serve as an adverbial
clause linker (see also example (20) above, where these verbs appear to link two
main clauses, instead of marking a subordinate clause):̃́

"350 A Grammar of Kakua13.2 Subordination
The combination of clauses in an asymmetric relation in Kakua is realized
through five main strategies. These are presented in the following table, indicating
which strategy is used for which kind of subordination:

xAs shown in Table 13.1 above, these five different subordinating strategies
are used to form three types of subordinate construction in Kakua. A canonical
description of subordination regards it as a particular type of combination of clauses,
such that one of them is syntactically and semantically dependent on the other (c.f.,
Langacker 1991, Cristofaro 2003). The subordinate clause functions as a constituent
of the higher clause. This presupposes a distinction between main clauses and
subordinate clauses. I follow here the general definitions of these three types of
subordinate constructions as defined in e.g. van Gijn et al (2011:3), Cristofaro
(2003), and Haumann (1997): complement clauses, which function as arguments of
the verb of the superordinate clause, are described in §13.5; relative clauses, which
function as modifiers of a noun phrase in the superordinate clause, are described in
§13.6, and adverbial clauses, which modify the verb of the higher clause or the higher
clause in its entirety, are described in §13.7.
As shown above, subordinate clauses in Kakua can often be identified by
morphological cues (suffixes, clitics, particles, or even verb roots): i.e., there are
morphological elements that serve to identify the subordinate clause in a complex
clause construction (Table 13.1). These elements, as introduced in Table 13.1, haveComplex Clauses351different syntactic positions with regard to the subordinate clause. They can be in
initial position of the subordinate clause (as with the temporal adverbial particle
tɨtimaʔ ‘then’), be cliticized to an element of the subordinate clause (as with switch
reference markers when used to link adverbial subordinate clauses, see §13.7 below),
suffixes (as with the subordinator suffix -ni, see §13.5 and §13.6 below), or as postor prepositions (as with the potential particle pînaʔ ‘POT’ see §13.7 below).
As presented in Chapter 11, the preferred order of constituents in Kakua is
that in which the predicate of the clause is in final position (S)OV. Adjuncts and
subordinate clauses tend to occur embedded in the main clause (see, however,
examples of exceptions to this in §13.4 for tail-head linkage, and in §13.5 for
complement clauses). The internal structure of the embedded clause also tends to
maintain the preferred OV order. Thus, in an asymmetric combination of clauses
(subordination), there are going to be two predicates, one pertaining to the
subordinated clause, and another one pertaining to the superordinate clause. A
structure similar to the following is typical for an asymmetric combination of clauses
in Kakua, where the square brackets refer to the subordinate clause in the
construction: (S)[(S)OV]OV.
The subordinate clause furthermore in the majority of cases precedes the
element that it modifies or is an argument of in the main clause. Thus, complement
clauses (§13.5) in the majority of cases precede the predicate of the main clause, as
follows: (S)[COMPLEMENT]V (see discussion of exceptions below). Likewise, relative
clauses (§13.6) tend to precede the N they modify, but relative clauses may also
follow their head. Example (14) illustrates a complement clause that precedes its
head, the predicate of the main clause.

Before turning to the specific description of the different types of subordinate
clauses in Kakua (complement, relative and adverbial clauses), the following
subsection, §13.3, focuses on the description of markers of switch reference in
Kakua, which play important roles in both main and subordinate clauses. A
subsection discussing bare verb roots, as introductory elements to subordinate
clauses, is given in §13.4. Finally, descriptions of complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses are given in §13.5, §13.6, and §13.7 respectively.
Causal constructions, which involve the use of a finite verb (and perhaps more
recently the repetition of a bare verb as a linking strategy to express causation), are
decribed in §13.8.","[370, 371, 372]"
"5.3.1 Alienable possession
Alienable nouns are those that when possessed take the possessive form of
the pronouns (see Table 5.4 below), or can also be marked with the possessive suffix
-ǐɁ ‘POSS’. Most nouns in Kakua are possessed through this strategy. When the
possessor is a full noun, in an alienable possessive construction, the possessor is
suffixed with the possessive morpheme -ǐʔ (examples (85)-(86) below). Note that
this suffix could be called a genitive case marker. However, it occurs in a different
morphosyntactic slot than other case markers, i.e., because it occurs on the dependentNoun compounding, noun classification and possession 171
rather than the head of the NP. For this reason is best not to understand this suffix
as a grammatical case morpheme.

"Chapter 12
Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0IntroductionThis chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1Minimal clauseA basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)

12.2The affirmative existential copular verb hɨmThe affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:

Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔiand the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: crossreferencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):

Although the affirmative existential verb hɨm can also be negated by attaching
the negation suffix -kan to it, Kakua speakers strongly prefer using the negative
existential wîʔikan, when the predicative or existential clause is negative. NegatingBasic clause structure and types of clauses319the verb hɨm (hɨm-kan ‘be/exist-NEG’) with the intended meaning of ‘not exist/not.be’
is qualified by most speakers as odd and is corrected to wîʔikan.
12.4Predicative possession constructionsKakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:
23) badʔdaʔ
deceasedtelu-ʧaʔquiver-CL:containerbɨdǐbe.bigʔĩ=t-bibùʔ=hip=tagǎ3PL=EVID-have=DUB=INF.EVID

hũptʃi ʔã=bibùʔ=na=ka

cold
3SG.M=have=DECL=ASS
‘the child has a cold’
As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).","[335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"
"13.5 Complement clauses
A complement clause is commonly defined as a clause that functions as a core
argument of the predicate of the main clause (c.f., Givón 2001:39, Dixon 2006:1540, Noonan 1985:46, 2007: 52). Predicates that can take a complement clause,
instead of an NP, as their argument, are commonly verbs that encode meanings of,
e.g., say, believe, wish, know, see, hear, tell (Noonan 2007). These type of predicatesComplex Clauses359are commonly called ‘complement-taking predicates’ or ‘CTPs’ (e.g. by Noonan
2007:53).
In Kakua, common CTPs are verbs like nih ‘say’, nǎwɁ ‘tell’, and hêjɁnahǔj
‘think/believe’ (from hêjɁ ‘know’ and hǔj ‘listen/understand’). Complement clauses
in Kakua do not take special subordinating morphology (i.e., a complementizer
particle). Syntactically, complement clauses are most typically embedded within the
main clause:
30) fǐt [Iginio tew-bǔpʧew-ni=na=ka]
1PL Iginio work-have.flu-ADJVZ=DECL=ASSfĩ=niɁ1PL=not.knowhêjɁnahǔj-kan=bethink-NEG=REC.PST
‘we didn’t think [that Iginio was sick]’ (with dengue)Although the complement clause tends to be embedded within the main
clause, alternative orders can also be found. Consider example (31), referring to a
child who is in her crawling stage, perhaps about to walk. In (31) the complement
clause occurs following the main clause. The alternative order in (32) is also accepted
by speakers.
31) kǎnɁ mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
3SG.F 3SG.F=say-think=DECL[ʧejbitmi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]tomorrow

follows the main clause:

1SG=know-NEG=ASS
WHAT=ASS
‘I don’t know [what they did]’Ɂĩ=ʧãh-ãp=tagǎ]3PL=do-PST=INF.EVIDAlternatively, the example shown above can also be analyzed as a
combination of two main clauses (e.g., ‘I don’t know, what did they do?’).","[379, 380]"
"11.3 Subject alignment
Subject arguments of intransitive verbs in Kakua are not treated distinctly
from those of transitive verbs. In other words, both A and S arguments behave in the
same way both morphologically and syntactically, exhibiting a prototypical
nominative-accusative type of morphosyntactic alignment: A=S≠P. Subject
arguments of a clause can be identified in two ways: they are NPs lacking
morphological marking for case (as opposed to other case-marked arguments), on
the one hand, and they trigger morphological agreement on the verb, on the other
hand. Compare the subject of the intransitive verb ʔêg ‘vomit’ in (11) with the subject
of the transitive verb hěmʔ ‘eat’ in (12) below. Note that in both cases the subject
argument is expressed by the pronoun kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ and it is indexed on the predicate
with the proclitic mi= ‘3SG.F’; the lack of morphological case marking and the
syntactic position of the subject noun phrase and the indexing on the verb seen in
the intransitive construction in (11) are the same as those in the transitive
construction in (12):
11) kǎnʔ
mi=ʔêg=na=ka
3SG.F
3SG.F=vomit=DECL=ASS
‘she is vomiting’

‘she ate the manioc bread, everything reallyǃ’
As mentioned above, a clause in Kakua can be formed by a subject and a
predicate, or by a predicate with a subject proclitic (in addition to no expression of
subject at all, if recoverable from the context). Consider the following intransitive
clauses. In (13) the subject argument is fully expressed with a free pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’ as well as indexed on the verb with the cross-referencing proclitic ã=
‘3SG.M’, which agrees in person, number and gender with the subject NP kǎn.",[329]
"Kakua displays a complex system of evidentiality, and many markers
(prefixes and enclitics), encode different evidentiality values. In SVCs, one
evidentiality value has scope over all the elements of the clause, and no additionalVerb serialization261or different value may be given to its elements individually (see Section §10.6, on

marking, for all arguments other than the subject of a clause, and subject indexing
on the verb by cross-referencing proclitics (see Chapter 6 on argument marking).
All the verbs in a SVC always share the same arguments in the clause, i.e. the
subject and objects, if present, see example (15) below. Even when no crossreferencing proclitic is present (when its referent was previously established in the
discourse, one of the exceptions allowing for the omission of subject indexing on the
verb; see Chapter 6 and Chapter 11), the verbs in the serialized construction have
the same arguments. In example (15), ‘he’ is the subject of both ‘burn’ and ‘give’
and ‘tobacco’ is the object of both of these verbs.","[281, 282]"
"120A Grammar of Kakuaa separate class from verbs and nouns. Finally, adjectives in Kakua can function as
verbs, taking all the available verbal morphology, suggesting that adjectives in Kakua
have a verbal origin.
The same argument given above to account for the derivation of the adjective
words hâp ‘new’, and hap ‘tall/up’, can serve to explain the diachronic development
of the adjective word jehěp ‘bad’. It could be argued that jehěp ‘bad’ is a lexicalized
form from the verb jěh ‘be.damaged’ plus the general past marker –Vp: jěh-ep
‘be.damaged-PST’. Because of phonological processes, the realization of a rising tone
in a bisyllabic morpheme is assigned to the last syllable, and thus, the tone of the
verb root jěh ‘be.damaged’ has its realization in the last syllable when it has been
lexicalized as a bisyllabic adjective jehěp.
The word jehěp can function as an adjective or as a verb, as shown in (70).

Perhaps the least etymologically transparent of the four adjectives in Kakua
is bɨdǐ ‘big’. However, even when its source is not clear, the fact that it can occur
both as a verb and as a free form (adjective), without the need of the adjectivizer
marker –ni, can serve as a sign to suspect its verbal origin. I acknowledge, however
that it is cross-linguistically common for adjective to share properties with either
nouns or verbs. My argument is based on the large number of descriptive verbs that
in Kakua serve to describe properties of nouns.
The examples in (71)-(73) below illustrate the adjective bɨdǐ ‘big’ used as an
attributive modifier (with animate and inanimate entities):

Like some verbs, the adjective bɨdǐ can also function as an adverb. When
functioning as an adverb, bɨdǐ occurs at the beginning of the clause, as in examples
(74) and (75) below, and its semantic meaning is that of ‘very much’:Types of morphemes and word classeŝ

The main features of the closed class of adjectives can be listed as follows:
a) Adjectival concepts in Kakua are generally expressed through descriptive verbs.
b) Attributive modification is expressed by adjectivized verbs, noun compounding
or noun classification.
c) The adjectivizer suffix is –ni. It can be attached to (descriptive) verb roots to
form adjectives. When attached to other verb roots (other than descriptive
verbs), it can also function as agent nominalization.
d) The adjective or adjectivized element has free syntactic order, although normally
it follows the modified element, it may also precede it.
e) The four adjectives identified in Kakua are items expressing the notions of ‘big’,
‘tall/up’, ‘new’, and ‘bad’. These four forms can be used as free forms (as
attributive concepts or modifiers), or as heads of a predicative construction.
f) The four attested adjectives do not take pronominal prefixes.
g) They share a number of features with verbs and some other features with nouns.
Unlike nouns, adjectives can take verbal morphology and can be nominalized.
And unlike verbs, adjectives can take nominal morphology.
h) Adjectives are synchronically monomorphemic, but some are probably
historically derived3.3.6 Adverbs
Like in the case for quality or attributive modification, modification of verbs
and clauses in Kakua is mostly expressed by verbs. However, there is a set of words
that are not verbs and that can also serve to modify verbs and clauses. These adverbs
are morphosyntactically different from verbs and nouns.
Although most members of this set of words have a clear etymological source
in verbs, they can be morphosyntactically distinguished from verbs in that they can
occur as free morphemes, whereas verbs must always occur with additional
inflectional morphology (see Chapter 8 for discussion of the exceptional cases when
verb roots can occur as free morphemes).
Most adverbs can constitute a sentence on their own, like nouns. Unlike
nouns, however, some adverbs cannot take case marking. Also, unlike nouns,
adverbs can take verbal morphology.
On the basis of their syntactic behavior adverbs can be divided into two sets.
A set of adverbs that occurs at the beginning of the clause they modify, and a set of
adverbs that occur as particles at the end of the clause that they modify.","[141, 142, 143]"
"Complex Clauses355As in the case of the different subject clitic, the same subject clitic can attach
to elements other than verbs. This is illustrated below (see also (15) above, where
the same subject clitic occurs on a pronoun):7nɨwá

‘Finally granddad! you bring him!, to your relative’
In summary, there are two clitics in Kakua that often seem to indicate a
change or maintenance of the subject across clauses, be these combinations of
independent clauses or combinations of independent and subordinate clauses. Note
that example (20) also involves the repetition of the verb and the object of the
preceding clause, as a strategy to temporally link independent clauses among
themselves. This strategy, described for many languages as tail-head linkage, is
presented in the following subsection.8
Some questions regarding switch reference markers that should be undertaken
in future research are: What conditions the syntactic position of switch reference
markers? What are the semantic, discourse, syntactic or pragmatic environments that
favors the occurrence of switch reference markers? Are the conditions regarding
their occurrence in main clauses different from the once governing their occurrence
in subordinate clauses?","[375, 376]"
"Basic clause structure and types of clauses325The locative enclitic, as illustrated in the examples above, attaches to the head
noun of the locative NP. The locative-marked NP tends to occur in initial position
(preceding core arguments). However, it can also be seen in the examples above
(e.g., (41) and (44) that an alternative placement of the locative adjunct is possible).
A second set of constructions expressing locative meanings are those
involving a positional verb, in which the verb specifies the location/position of the
nominal. This verb often appears as part of a serial verb construction (see Chapter
9). Constructions of this type do not require the locative marker =bǔ. Examples are
given in (46)-(47) below:

Table §12.1 below gives some examples of positional verbs. A list of
positional verbs can be found in Chapter 8. Note that these verbs express inessive
and adessive locative meanings not expressed by the locative clitic case marker =bǔ.

independent clauses in Kakua. Declarative clauses are described in §12.9, followed
by a section describing interrogative polar and content questions (§12.10). Section
§12.11 provides a description of affirmative imperative clauses and §12.12 of
negative imperatives. These sections show that these types of clauses differ in their
possibility of encoding evidential categories.
All of these clause types have dedicated markers, as given in Table 11.2
below. Additional description and exemplification of these markers are also
presented in other chapters. Chapter 10 on TAME describes the meanings of these
markers in the context of other markers encoding mood, e.g., frustrative, dubitative,
and other moods. Chapter 8 gives a basic template of the verb and describes the
syntactic position of these markers within the verbal word.

12.9Declarative clausesDeclarative clauses in Kakua are those expressing statements (in the sense of
Palmer 2001:65). Declarative clauses are morphologically marked by the clitic =na.
Note, however, that in many cases the declarative marker does not occur. The criteria
predicting the omission, or facultative marking, of the declarative clitic, are left for
future research.
From a formal perspective declarative clauses do not have special
phonological features (like, for example, dedicated intonation, or other phonological
traits to be found exclusively in declarative clauses) nor do they have a special
constituent order. Declarative clauses can express affirmative or negative statements,
as seen in the examples in (48)-(49) below:

12.10 Interrogative clauses12.10.0 Interrogative clauses
Kakua has two main types of interrogative clauses: Content (or questionword) interrogative clauses, and polar (yes-no) interrogative clauses. Content
questions (§12.10.2 below) are formed by using interrogative pronouns or other
interrogative words like interrogative demonstratives and/or adverbials (see Chapter
7 on interrogative pronouns and question words). Polar interrogative clauses
(§12.10.1 below), on the other hand, are morphologically marked by the clitic =nit.
Interrogative clauses contrast with declarative clauses in that the declarative marker
=na does not occur in interrogative clauses. They do not differ from declarative
clauses in word order. Also no particular intonational pattern is required to
exclusively mark interrogative clauses (although in future work intonation patterns
in interrogative clauses should be looked at carefully).. Interrogative clauses can be
both affirmative and negative. When negative, the verbal predicate must be marked
by the negation suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’, or the negative existential wîɁikan ‘not.exist’
is used. Compare the following examples:

that interrogative clauses have not been found to occur with the entire range of
evidentiality distinctions (I have found them occuring only with the inferred
evidential markers). Further research should focus on specifically testing for
acceptance of each of the evidential markers in interrogative clauses and explore the
reasons why some (at least the inferred category) are allowed to occur whereas other
categories are not. Examples (55) above and (58) below illustrate interrogative
clauses occurring with the inferred evidential. It is interesting to note that evidential
markers can occur in interrogative clauses, even though one might think that
evidential marking presupposes assertion.
Additionally, the interrogative marker can also co-occur with the dubitative
mood suffix -hi ‘DUB’ in the same clause, as illustrated in (60) below. See Chapter
10 for further descriptions of interaction of the interrogative mood with evidentiality
and other mood markers.

while in interrogative clauses formed with question words, the presence of = nit is
optional, and it is most often omitted.","[345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"

‘to pack’ʔâmuʔ5) a.‘to plant big seeds’‘type of mushroom’
‘be happy’For the Kakua varieties of Wacará, mûmuʔ serves to express both ‘to plant
big seeds’ and ‘type of champignon’. Only context can disambiguate the meaning of
this word. Also in Wacará, while ʔâmuʔ means ‘to pack’ or ‘organize inside a
container’, the word expressing ‘be happy’ is wè̃j̀ . Both ʔâmuʔ and wè̃j̀ were accepted
for the Kakua speakers of Nuevo Pueblo as words meaning ‘be happy’. I have not
tested for whether or not a similar word with similar semantics is found in the
surrounding languages of the area to infer a borrowing into Kakua.
Based on the contrasts presented above only, I propose, with reservations, that
Kakua had /o/ as a contrastive sound that was lost as a contrast and became
neutralized into one phonemic sound in the dialects spoken in Wacará, while
remaining two different contrastive sounds in the Kakua dialects spoken in Nuevo
Pueblo.4 The data in hand, however, are not sufficient to support this hypothesis and
future dialectal studies are needed in order to have more evidence against or in favor
of this hypothesis.5
For the moment being, the data at hand only supports the vowel inventory
shown in Table 2.1 above for the Kakua varieties spoken in Wacará, where the back
mid vowel [o] will be considered a marginal phoneme.

Pueblo is given in Table 2.4 below.

"3.1.1 Identifying affixes and clitics
A property common to affixes and clitics is that there are no pauses in
between these formatives and their hosts. The main syntactic characteristic that
differentiates affixes from clitics in Kakua is that clitics, unlike affixes, can attach to
different hosts. The ‘freedom of host selection’ is a defining characteristic of
prototypical clitics cross-linguistically (cf. Bickel & Nichols 2007: 174, see also
Haspelmath & Sims 2010: 197ff.). Affixes, on the other hand, have a much more
restricted syntactic distribution and are, for the most part, exclusive to a particular98A Grammar of Kakuaparts of speech. An overview of some of the clitic morphemes and their hosts is

from a distance far from the actor) do not satisfy the criteria of freedom of hostTypes of morphemes and word classes99selection. However, they are still being described as clitics here, because they occur
after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).

Normally, the remote past clitic occurs at the very end of a construction. These
examples are not common. I only have gathered a few. One such is:

(long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
‘el cadaver finado’)Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:

violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:

are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ

Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"

Question-word interrogative clauses elicit specific information (as opposed to
‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers sought in polar questions). Content questions are formed by
using the relevant question word (the question word can occassionally be omitted,
see below). A list of interrogative words (discussed in Chapter 7) is given in Table
12.3. These interrogative words are derived from the interrogative stem de- (see
Chapter 7 for an extensive description of interrogative pronouns and other question
words).

Note one question word dêʔe has two meanings, ‘who’ and ‘where’ (examples
(76)-(78)). Its interpretation is based on inference driven by context. The
interpretation of the question word dêʔe ‘where/who’ as ‘where’ in (82) below, for
example, is inferred by speakers based on context.

Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).

Kakua does not have a dedicated ‘no’ particle. The negative existentialwîʔikan serves as an expression of clausal negation. Alternatively, negation can also
be expressed by the verbal suffix -kan/-kap ‘NEG’ (for verbal negation).
Either of these two can be used when responding negatively to a question. A
negative response to a polar question can be done by repeating the predicate of the
interrogative clause and adding the negation suffix -kan/-kap (88), or with the clausalBasic clause structure and types of clauses335negative expression wîʔikan (89). A negative response to a content question can
include the expression of negation wîʔikan (89):

interrogative clauses. Content interrogative clauses demand a full declarative clause
as a response, or just an NP.
12.11 Imperative clauses
Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):
90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
‘listen carefully!’
91) hemʔ-é
eat-IMP
‘eat!’336A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
‘tell me’5
Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:
93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́
return-IMP
‘come back!’
94) ɲaw-á

construction at the end of this section.","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]"
"10.3 Mood: illocution and modality
The modal categories in Kakua are very versatile and encode many more
distinctions than any other category related to the event or situation encoded by the
predicate.
While tense and aspect deal with temporal particularities of a proposition
(‘external temporal constituency’ and ‘internal temporal constituency’, respectively,
as in Comrie 1976:3), mood deals with finer specifications regarding the status of
the proposition, reflecting a speaker’s attitude towards the proposition, “not directly
concerned with situating an event in the actual world, as conceived by the speaker”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). Consequently, mood in Kakua is described here as the
morphological category that is not anchored to an expression of time, but rather it is
concerned with expressing “the status of the proposition” describing the event (I
follow here Palmer’s 2001 general definition of mood). This is to say, mood in Kakua
conforms to a cross-linguistic grammatical category that expresses something about
the speaker’s view of the proposition (c.f. Bybee 1990, Palmer 2001, Hengeveld
2004 for discussions of mood).
Hengeveld (2004) proposes a subdivision of the category of mood into
illocution and modality, illocution being “instances of specific types of speech acts”,
while modality is “concerned with the modification of the content of speech acts”
(Hengeveld 2004:1190). In the subsequent sections I follow Hengeveld’s division of
mood, and describe separately illocution and modality as categories of mood in
Kakua. The motivation for adopting Hengeveld’s division of mood categories is
mainly a semantic one. Dividing the mood markers in Kakua into two groups helpsTense, aspect, mood and evidentiality281to better describe their semantics: illocution markers are ‘unqualified’ expressions
of the speech acts, whereas modality markers do express the type of relationship,
expectations, or attitude of the speaker towards the content of these speech acts
(modality can “modify the content of the speech acts” ibid). Additionally, only the
group of illocution markers can constitute types of clauses. The same cannot be said
for the modality markers, which do not form types of clauses (there are no clauses
such as ‘frustrative clauses’ or ‘dubitative clauses’).
The semantics of these categories are described in the subsequent sections.
Section §10.4 describes grammatical morphemes encoding illocution, 5 and section
§10.5 describes the different morphemes expressing modality. Evidentiality is
presented separately in §10.6. Note that all three categories are considered to be part
of the overall mood category in Kakua.
A formal distinction between illocution and modality, as presented in
Hengeveld (2004), is that “in the expression of illocution the morphological category
of mood has to compete with word order and intonation as markers of particular
subdistinctions, whereas modality is expressed by mood markers only” (Hengeveld
2004:1190). As shown in the subsequent sections, although one of the illocution
morphemes comes along with a particular intonation, it is not necessarily the case
that illocution morphemes in Kakua, as opposed to modality morphemes, compete
in terms of word order and intonation with other subdistinctions. Rather, I will say
that the primary distinction between illocution markers and modality markers in
Kakua, is that, as stated above, illocution markers have the ability to indicate a clause
type, whereas modality markers does not.
Morphosyntactically, it cannot be said that there is a distinction that
characterizes one or the other type of mood. Although most of these markers have
their own dedicated morphosyntactic slots, and while most occur following the stem
(as suffixes or enclitics), there are some in prefixing position (specifically
evidentiality markers).","[301, 302]"
"13.4 Bare verb roots as clause linkers: tail-head linkage
In addition to the switch reference markers presented in §13.3 above, Kakua
uses repetition of bare verb roots as a strategy to link clauses, in a system of ‘tailhead linkage’9 (c.f., Hopper 1979, Stirling 1993, Thompson et al. 2007; also Givón
2001: 347). Tail-head linkage, as described previously for other languages, consists
of connecting (groups of) sentences or clauses by partially or completely repeating
the predicate of the last element of the linked clauses or sentences (the ‘tail’) at the7Note also that, as in the case of the different subject marker, the same subject marker in example(15) and (23) above is cliticized onto an element of the main clause. Thus, this same subject marker should
not be described as a marker of subordination, rather, it can be more accurately described as a marker
that serves to combine clauses.
8Note however that the repetition of the object argument is not a usual characteristic of tail-headlinkage strategies.
9Other terms used are ‘linkage’, ‘head-tail linkage’, ‘recapitulative linkage’, ‘tail-headrecapitulation’ (c.f., Guillaume 2011:109 ff and other references there given). It is commonly found simply
with the abbreviation THL.",[376]
"320A Grammar of Kakua12.5Comparative constructionsThe function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.

and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:Basic clause structure and types of clauses

equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.
A further description of Kakua’s particles, including the ones occurring within
comparative constructions, can be found in Chapter 3.

The superlative, describing a situation in which the comparee has the highest
degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).

relations, including identity, class inclusion, and class membership. Examples in

Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.
12.7Basic locative constructionsA basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in324A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :2

2SG=want=INTERR
‘which (one) do you want?’
Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:
17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be

‘what (story) do you know?’
Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):

20) dêʔe-wɨʔ=diʔ=ti=be

‘whose son did you see?’ma=ʔên2SG=seeKakua has a set of forms that are homophonous to the element de- present in
the interrogative forms: the inferred future evidentiality enclitic =dê ‘INF.FUT.EVID’;
and the noun dê ‘relative’ (‘person who is related). The extent to which these forms
may or may not be related is unknown.","[236, 237, 238]"
"13.6 Relative Clauses
Relative clauses are clauses that modify an NP of the main clause (c.f.,
Keenan 1985, Van Valin 2005:183-224). In Kakua, relative clauses differ from
complement clauses in that they are marked with the relativizer suffix –ni/-nit12 (here
glossed as SUBR ‘subordinator’) that attaches to the predicate of the relative clause.
The relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. 13 When the relative clause is
modifying the object argument of the main clause, the object marker may also occur
on the relative clause (e.g. (35) below). The relativized noun phrase can be the
subject, or object (as in (35)-(36) below) within the relative clause. There is no
relative pronoun in Kakua, and as the examples below show, the subordinator suffix
marks the predicate of the relative clause:

‘they killed the opossum [that ate the pineapple]’12Note the (near) homophony of this morpheme with other functional morphemes in Kakua: theinterrogative clitic =nit ‘INTERR’ (Chapter 8), agent nominalizer suffix -ni ‘A.NMLZ’ (Chapter 4),collective plural -nit ‘PL’ (Chapter 4), and same subject clitic =nit ‘S.S’ (Chapter 8 and section §13.3
above). The homophony of morphemes in Kakua has been seen also for other morphemes (e.g., declarative=na, inanimate plural number -na; emphatic =bǔ and locative =bǔ). The extent to which all of the
-ni/=nit forms might have a historic relation hasn’t been explored yet. Finally, the variants -ni ~ -nit as
complementizer suffixes seem to have free variation even within one and the same speaker. Since I did
not test for a context in which one form would be preferred over the other, a more systematic study should
be undertaken in future research on Kakua.
13According to Dryer (2013), relative clauses preceding the noun are rather uncommon outsideof Asia. He also points out that typologically languages in which the relative clause precedes the noun are
also verb-final languages, which is true for Kakua.",[381]
"3.1Overview of types of morphemes3.1.0 Overview of the morphosyntactic characteristics of the types of morphemes
This section summarizes the main characteristics of the different types of
morphemes in Kakua.
Syntactically, morphemes in Kakua can be divided into two basic types of
morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes.
Free morphemes are monomorphemic roots, which may represent nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, or particles. Verbs, on the other hand, cannot occur as free
morphemes (exceptions to this are discussed in Chapter 8 where a full description of
Kakua’s verbal morphology is given).
Bound morphemes can be subdivided into three types: i) roots, ii) affixes, and
iii) clitics. Bound roots have lexical semantic content, whereas formatives (affixes
and clitics) tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. Some formatives,
nonetheless, have a clear lexical source from which a grammatical function has been
derived, and both the semantic meaning and the grammatical function can still be
identified.
Most of the grammatical morphology in Kakua occurs after the stem. Thus,
the set of suffixes and enclitics is larger than the set of prefixes and proclitics.
Affixes can be further subdivided into inflectional and derivational affixes.
Derivational affixes are optional whereas inflectional affixes are obligatory.
A list of the different types of morphemes in Kakua is seen in Table 3.1
below:Types of morphemes and word classes97Table 3.1 Overview of types of morphemes in Kakua

intensifiers and emphasis
morphemesAs opposed to the free morphemes and bound roots, affixes and clitics cannot
function as heads of phrases. Those morphemes that can function as head of phrases
are understood as words, whereas affixes and clitics form the set of formatives in
Kakua. The morphosyntactic characteristics of these formatives are described in
§3.1.2 below.
The semantics and morphosyntax of the different word classes in Kakua are
described in §3.2 and §3.3 of this chapter.","[118, 119]"
"2.2Syllable structure2.2.0 General description: syllable
The preferred syllable structure in Kakua is CVC. Most of Kakua’s
morphemes are monosyllabic (84% of the word list used for this work). Syllables
without an onset occur only in V-initial affixes.
Though at a lower rate, open syllables (CV) are also encountered. In wordfinal position, however, these open syllables undergo phonetic vowel lengthening,
forming heavy syllables [CV:].
The process of phonetic vowel lengthening, together with Kakua’s preferred
CVC syllabic structure, seeks to produce heavy syllables as the ideal prototype of
syllabic structure (as the hierarchy below shows).
The syllabic weight can be understood in terms of a continuum favoring CVC
syllables, and whenever an open syllable cannot be avoided, then phonetic vowel
lengthening provides extra weight to the surface structure. Virtually, this continuum
will gradually become flexible in order to include less preferred structures until
finally reaching the less heavy syllabic structure:
CVC > CV: > CV > VC > V
/CVC/
includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
/CV/ (and [CV:]) includes: content word roots, affixes, clitics
/VC/
includes: V-initial affixes
/V/
includes affixes
In mono- and bisyllabic loans involving root-final open syllables, the CVC
structure is adopted whenever possible, demonstrating a preference for the CVC
syllabic pattern. In borrowings with open syllables, by default the glottal stop /ʔ/ isPhonology 65
epenthesized in the coda position of the final syllable of the word. Speakers of Kakua
speaking Spanish usually transfer the CVC pattern to Spanish:
Spanish
[si]
[pa.pel]
[me.sa]
[ma.ɾi.na]Kakua
[tiʔ]
[pa.pe.laʔ]
[me.saʔ-paʔa]
[ʔĩnãʔ]‘yes’
‘paper’
‘table-cl.flat’
‘Marina’ (proper name)As noted in the examples above, in loan words the glottal stop occurs as a
default epenthetic consonant as a strategy to increase syllable weight, forming an
ideal heavy CVC syllable, whether epenthesized in onset or in coda position.
Vowel-initial suffixes do not insert any epenthetic consonant at the
syllable/morpheme boundary even when the morpheme to which the suffix attaches
is an open-syllable morpheme: CV-VC. This shows evidence that these V-initial
suffixes do not have empty consonant slots. Some of these V-initial suffixes do have
unspecified vowel slots (e.g. past marker -Vp) in which cases the vowel in the suffix
copies the vowel quality of the root to which the suffix is bound.","[86, 87]"

sequencing of events is tɨtimaʔ ‘then’. In example (45) below the adverbial particle
links a nominalized subordinate clause (see below) to a main clause:

‘Today I’m better, after she gave (me) her medicine, I am better finally’
Additionally, Kakua has a set of other adverbial particles (see Chapter 3,
section §3.3.6 on adverbs) that can serve as temporal adverbial linkers between a
main clause and a subordinate clause.

Purpose adverbial clauses can take the potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’.
Unlike the other subordinate clauses, purpose adverbial subordinate clauses follow
the main clause. The potential morpheme pînaɁ ‘POT’ does not have any evident
etymological source. The fact, however, that it forms adverbial clauses that are
different from all other ones in that they follow the main clause, may suggest a
historic development of pînaɁ ‘POT’ that is different from other Kakua particles.

‘learn how to work, they said [for your strength]’
Also in the absence of adverbial particles, the nominalization of the predicate
of the subordinate clause is used in Kakua as a type of adverbial subordination to
describe a result or a process together with its result. Note that nominalization is a
common strategy that South American languages use to create subordinate clauses
(van Gijn et al. 2011:3). In Kakua, nominalizations can function in the same way as
other subordinate clauses, where the adverbial subordinate clause precedes the main
clause being modified. The subject of the nominalized verb is also the subject of the
superordinate clause. Examples are given below:̌ ʔɨ=tʃaʔ

A causal relation between two events can be expressed in Kakua by a
predicate construction with the verb root hîb. The use of this verb to express a causal
relation seems to be falling out of use, and only a few older people still use this verb
with a meaning such as ‘do as a consequence of’. Some speakers reported still
knowing and using this verb with such a meaning; however, they still attributed the
correct use of this verb to the older generation. Also, while in an elicitation session
with an elderly speaker, the young men accompanying the session would inquire
about the meaning of hîb when used by the older speaker. The following example
illustrates an instance where the verb hîb is used to express a causal relation:

‘Since he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’
Younger speakers make use of some of the adverbial strategies in order to
construct causal relations, but more often by linking clauses via bare verb roots
(described in 13.4 above), resulting in constructions like the elicited example in (52)
below:
52) ʔã=t-ʔɨw-ɨp=be
3SG.M=EVID-sleep-PST=REC.PST,ʔã=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=beʔɨwɨsleephiwjaguarkǎn=diʔ3SG.M=OBJ3SG.M=EVID-eat=REP.EVID=REC.PST
‘he fell asleep. Sleeping, the jaguar ate him’ (because he fell asleep, the jaguar
ate him)368 A Grammar of Kakua13.9 SummaryKakua has different mechanisms of expressing the relation between events:
i)
ii)
iii)Verb serialization, which serves to express events that are
conceptually integrated into a bigger event (described in Chapter 9)
and which is not a combination of clauses,
coordination, which serves to express a symmetrical relationship
among different independent clauses (described in §13.1 in the
present chapter),
subordination, which expresses a dependent relationship among the
combined clauses (described from §13.2 onwards in the present
chapter).","[385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"
"Body parts
In principle all terms referring to body parts in Kakua are obligatorily
possessed; they must always be preceded by N-ǐʔ (the inalienable strategy of using
plain bound pronouns, shown in Table 5.5 above, is not used for body parts), or can
be bound to the possessor forming part-whole relations (see discussion for (105)
below), and body part terms used in numerals (see Chapter 7 for description of
numerals)
When the possessor of a body part is unspecified or unknown, the term
referring to such body parts must occur with the possessive pronoun for 3SG
masculine ʔãǰʔ= ‘3SG.M.POSS’:

Compounding of two body part nouns serves a possessive function of the
part-whole type. Note that in this type of construction there is no use of a possessive
proclitic or possessive pronoun on either element. I interpret this lack of a possessor
on an otherwise obligatorily possessed noun as an indication that the compound in
itself is sufficient to express the possessive relationship, since the body part terms
are not occurring on their own as free roots. However, the different marking when
taking a proclitic pronoun sets them apart from inalienably possessed nouns, since
these body part terms do take possessive pronouns as opposed to inalienably
possessed kin term nouns:
104) mã̌w-deppâwa-idǐp-na
haʔ-jǔ‘gums’ (tooth-flesh)
‘ribs’ (rib-bone-PL)
‘beard’ (mouth-hair)As described in section §5.2 inanimate nouns can be specified for shape by
taking shape classifier suffixes. Body part terms are also specified for their shape as
illustrated in the following examples. In these compounds too, possessor marking is
absent, but I follow the same assumption made for the previous examples in (104)
above, where the compound in itself has a possessive function. In any case, nouns
referring to body parts do not occur on their own, and must have some kind of bound
morphology, be it a possessive pronoun, another noun (N-N), a noun classifier (NNclassifier), or other morphology:
105) mǎw-paʔawâw-daʔ
mɨh-naʔ
wɨ ̂-naʔ‘jaw’ (tooth-CL:concave)
‘head’(head-CL:round)
‘arm’ (arm-CL:tree)
‘leg’ (leg-CLːtree)B. Part-whole relationships
Nouns whose referents are considered to be inherently part of another referent
(like plant parts as seen in 5.2 above in the description of classifiers) are obligatorily
bound. In such constructions, N1 corresponds to the whole and N2 to its part (see
§5.1 above on noun compounding strategies and productivity). Examples of these
part-whole relations are given below:
106) ʔɨ ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit
blowgun-base.of.blow.gun-CLːlog
‘mouth piece of the blowgun’
107) mɨh-fwẽ̌h
river-other.side
‘shore’180A Grammar of KakuaWhat sets these examples apart from inalienably possession is that when
possessed via a pronoun, the possessive pronoun is used, instead of the bound (nonpossessive) pronoun, which is exclusively the inalienable strategy. Thus, to express
that the mouth piece of the blowgun pertains to somebody, e.g., ‘my mouth piece of
̃̌
the blowgun’, the relation will be expressed as wiʔ=ʔɨ
̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit, using the possessive
form of the pronoun, and not as *wã=ʔɨ ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit with the non-possessive pronoun.
C. Other obligatorily possessed entities
Terms referring to objects that are closely associated with people or that are
indispensable for subsistence are also inherently possessed. Therefore, nouns
referring to these elements must always be encoded within a possessive construction.
The set of other obligatorily possessed entities includes the followingː
i)
ii)

In addition to the strategies presented above for the expression of possessive
relations, Kakua encodes a possessive relation between nouns referring to animate
entities and a place to which the entity is affiliated (the ‘belonging’ of an animate
referent to a certain place). The morphemes marking this type of possessive relation
are called here associative markers. Associative markers are clitics that have a
singular form =bû ‘ASSOC.SG’, and a plural counterpart =mǔn ‘ASSOC.PL’:

Argument marking and case marking
6.0IntroductionThis Chapter presents a description of Kakua’s syntactic and morphological
strategies for coding grammatical relations of arguments, and also describes case
marking for adjuncts.
The grammatical relations of arguments in Kakua are marked by
morphological and syntactic means. An interesting characteristic of the coding of
grammatical relations in Kakua is its mixture of head-marking and dependentmarking strategies (in terms of Nichols 1986).
Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb (a head-marking strategy),
while object arguments (encompassing any argument in a function other than
subject), receive case morphology, marked on the NPs themselves (a dependentmarking strategy, see examples 1-3 in Chapter 3).
Kakua’s alignment is strictly nominative-accusative. Object arguments and
adjuncts receive case marking. This is summarized in Table 6.1 below:

(adjuncts)Locative=bǔInstrumental/Comitative=hiʔ̃́Terminativepɨ (preposition)Kakua does not have different markers for arguments expressed by nouns or
pronouns.
In the subsequent sections of this Chapter I provide a description of the
characteristics of the coding of grammatical relations and case markers in Kakua.
The expression of subject arguments is described in section §0. Object
arguments in Kakua are morphologically marked by case; this is described in §0.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"
"9.1Serial verb constructionsSerial verb constructions (henceforth SVCs) are constructions consisting of
two or more verb roots in sequence such that they represent one single clause. In
such a construction, there should be no other element (grammatical nor lexical) in
between the verb roots.
Haspelmath (2014) has proposed a series of descriptive generalizations for
SVCs across languages. Loosely following these, I propose in the following list the
defining properties specific to SVCs in Kakua:
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)
vi)Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately .
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same tense value and may not be
given different tense values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same aspectual value and may not
be given different aspectual values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same mood value and may not be
given different mood values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same evidentiality value and may
not be given different evidentiality values individually.
Components of a SVC in Kakua share the same argumentsI proceed now to provide examples in order to illustrate each of these
properties of SVCs in Kakua:
i)Components of a SVC in Kakua may not be negated separately :The scope of negation in Kakua is the entire clause, and no element smaller
than a clause may be negated. In SVCs then, the scope of negation runs over allVerb serialization259elements (all verbs and other morphology) within the SVC, rather than over one
single verb of the SVC. See examples (4)-(5) below:1

‘I don’t know, don’t talk’If one verb of the construction were to be negated separately, the resulting
interpretation of the utterance changes drastically. Compare (4) above to the elicited
variant in (6) below:
6)měm=diʔ nɨmɁ=héʔma=hêjʔ-kanjap-bak=nit1SG=OBJ be.under=INTS 2SG=know-NEG
pass-emerge=INTERR
‘you don’t know, can (you) pass to the other side (if you go) underneath me?’Components of a SVC in Kakua have the same tense value and may not be
given different tense values individually.ii)The tense suffixes in Kakua are past –Vp, immediate future –min, and general
future –bip (see also Chapter 8 for verb morphology in Kakua and Chapter 10 on
tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality). These markers are always suffixed closest to
the verb root of the clause (see Chapter 8 for a full template of verb morphology). If
in a SVC, the tense suffix will attach to the last verb root in the construction.
Crucially, the scope of tense is over the entire set of serialized verbs. See examples
(7)–(8) below:

‘you all put inside and ate the night ants’1Note that the English translation given in (5) above might suggest that the verbs are negatedseparately, and not as a SVC as a whole. The construction in Kakua, however, is conceived as a SVCeven though the translation in English fails to express this. Negating each of the verbs in the constructionseparately would require the overt marking of the negation suffix -kan to occur on each of the verb stems
resulting in a combination of clauses (see §9.3 below for discussion of SVC and coordination):

"6.1The expression of subject argumentsAs shown in Table 6.1 in the introduction to this chapter, subject arguments
(for both transitive and intransitive predicates) in Kakua are not marked by case;
instead, subject arguments are indexed on the verb with cross-referencing proclitics
that encode number and person values of the subject argument (and gender for 3 rd
person singular subjects). Subject marking in Kakua is thus done by head-marking
(on the verb), while other arguments are dependent-marked (by case).
Table 6.2 below gives a list of Kakua subject proclitics (see Chapter 7 for a
detailed description of Kakua’s pronominal system). The proclitic ʔã=, here glossed
as ‘3SG.M’, is used for any 3rd singular subject argument that is not feminine; that is
to say, the ʔã= proclitic is used as a “default” 3rd singular in general.

In the intransitive clause in (1), the subject argument húptʃi ‘summer’ is crossreferenced on the verb by the proclitic ʔã = ‘3SG’. In the transitive clauses in (2)
and (3) the subject argument is a free pronoun and the cross-referencing proclitic on
the predicate of the clause agrees in person and number with the subject pronoun. In
(4) and (5) the subject is not expressed by a noun phrase, but the proclitic on the
verb alone expresses the subject argument of the clause:̃̌ ʔ=na=ka

Subject indexing on the verb, however, can also be omitted under specific
semantic and discourse conditions, related to animacy, definiteness, and if the
argument can be recuperated from the discourse.
The omission of cross-referencing morphology due to semantic criteria seems
to be typologically common (c.f., Givón 1979; Lambrecht 1994, Comrie 1989, Croft
2003, Iemmolo 2011).
In Kakua, if the subject argument of a clause can be recuperated from the
discourse context, cross-referencing proclitics are not obligatory, and thus may be
omitted.
Example (6) below illustrates one such case. This example is taken from a
conversation in which the speaker producing the text was commenting on the time
when a group of Nɨkak people were brought to the Kakua village in Wacará in the
early 90’s. At the beginning of the conversation it was established that the Nɨkak
people came, as illustrated in (6):

‘the Nɨkak came, they went to the forest’Following the statement in (6), the speaker moves on to comment on the
various different activities that the Nɨkak people did while in Wacará. Note that the
first predicate in (6) is marked with the cross-referencing proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’A Grammar of Kakua186(highlighted in boldface) in agreement with the subject argument nùtkãkwã1 ‘Nɨkak’.
The second predicate in (6) and the predicates in (7) below, mâw ‘kill’ and nǎwʔ
‘tell’, have the same argument nùtkãkwã ‘Nɨkak’, but they do not have the expected
cross-referencing proclitic ʔĩ= ‘3PL’. I have highlighted in boldface these predicates
which should be expected to carry the cross-referencing proclitic:

‘They killed animals (it seemed), they told of three, two (animals) they'd killed

argument can be recovered from discourse and thus cross-referencing proclitics can
be omitted. These examples come from a narrative in which the speaker starts out
by establishing that one day he went out to look for food (8); then the speaker
continues to tell the different activities that he did while looking for food. Note that
once the speaker has established who the main topic of the story is, cross-referencing
proclitics are omitted in the other verb constructions (9).

The bound pronouns (proclitics) are normally bound to a head noun or verb.
When bound to verbs, the proclitics serve as cross-references to the subject argument
of the clause (see Chapter 6 on argument marking in Kakua).
The set of pronouns that are called “bound pronouns” can also occur without
being attached to a head noun or verb, but in this case the bound pronoun must
always be followed by another clitic to form a phonological word. The contexts
motivating the constructions of the pronouns without a head noun or verb need to be
explored in future research.
An example of the proclitic occurring with additional morphology only,
lacking a head noun or verb, is illustrated in (5) below:
5)fwɨb=bereturn=REC.PSTwã=beʔên=tâ=tikmâ-naʔtree-CL:treekanʔã=bewɨw3SG.M3SG.M=REC.PST caimanʔã=bewɨw1SG=recognize=INF.EVID=INTS
3SG.M=REC.PST caiman
‘I came back, (with) a stick I recognized the caiman, he must have been a
caiman!’
Unlike the free pronouns, the forms of the bound pronouns do not have lexical
tone specification; instead, their tone value is assigned by the elements in the
surrounding environment to which the proclitics are attached (usually the tonal value
is assigned by the roots to which the pronoun is clitized). In cases such as the one
presented in (5) above, where the bound pronoun lacks a head, and instead it occurs
only with other morphology, which are themselves also toneless, the entire set of
bound morphemes is realized with a low tone.
When pronominal forms function as subjects, objects, or comitative or
locative adjuncts they take case markers indicating their function within the clause:214A Grammar of Kakua6)kǎnʔkan=diʔ3SG.F
3SG.M=OBJ
‘She ate it’ (it is said)mi=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=be3SG.F=EVID-eat-PST=REP.EVID=REC.PSTAs described in Chapter 5, (bound) pronouns can be used to indicate
possessive relationships. Inalienably possessed nouns take bound pronouns, while
alienably and inherently possessed nouns take the possessive (bound) pronouns (see
Chapter 5, §5.3, for description of possession). As mentioned in Chapter 5 (§5.3),
the possessive pronominal forms in Kakua are derived from a combination of the
bound forms of the pronouns with the possessor marker –íʔ. This is shown in Table
7.1 above in the column of possessive pronouns. An example of an alienably
possessed noun marked with the possessive bound pronoun is given in example (7)
below:

‘[they parted…], he (the armadillo) on his way, and the person also on his way’
Free pronominal forms do not have variants when used as possessive forms.
Kakua pronouns can have anaphoric functions, referring back to a previously
mentioned noun or noun phrase, as discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 (§11.2 on
subject alignment).
In Kakua narratives, usually a (3SG.M) pronoun is sufficient to refer to the
main participant of the story, and the expression of the participant as a lexical noun
is not necessary. Example (8) below illustrates a situation in which two participants
of the narrated event are being referred to by using 3SG.M pronouns only:

‘he (the person) shot darts to him (the jaguar)’Like the demonstrative form kan (see above), the third person pronoun can
also be used for generic reference to inanimate entities in general, or abstract
concepts like thoughts, feelings, or ideas. The bound pronoun highlighted in bold in
̃̂
example (9), anaphorically refers to the derived noun higaɁ-at
be.sad-NMLZ
‘sadness’. It can also be translated into ‘it (the sadness)’. Example (10) illustrates an
instance of the pronoun kǎn used for generic anaphoric reference.","[234, 235, 236]"
"10.4 Illocution
10.4.0 Introduction
Illocution refers to a semantic subgroup of mood markers that function to
express the communicative intention with which the speaker presents a proposition.
As such, the communicative status of the proposition in Kakua can be that of an
assertion, a question, or a command. This section deals with these three basic
illocution markers, namely declarative (§10.4.1), interrogative (§10.4.2), and
imperative (§10.4.3).
The markers of illocution are presented here only briefly in order to illustrate
their semantics. This is because these markers have a formal distinction as well as a
semantic one: they have the ability to form clause types (clause types are described5A formal description of illocution marking is presented in Chapter 12 (clause types).",[302]
"3PL=eat-NMLZ

‘doctor/healer’
A detailed discussion of nominalization strategies in Kakua is given below inPosition 3: Number marking
Kakua distinguishes between singular and non-singular. Singular is
unmarked. Non-singular number is marked by means of three different morphemes.
The choice of these morphemes depends on the semantics of the noun. Some nouns,
such as màɁ ‘water’, or běp ‘mud’ don’t take number marking, suggesting that they
form a set of mass nouns. However, the mass-count noun distinction in Kakua hat
not been studied further so far.
The plural suffix -na serves to encode plural number for most inanimate
nouns, as illustrated in (8)-(9):
8)9)mɨ ̌–nahouse-PL
‘houses’miʔ=nih-at-na3SG.F.POSS=say-NMLZ-PL
‘her sayings’The plural suffix -wã encodes plural number for most animate nouns, as
illustrated in (10)-(11) below:132A Grammar of Kakua10) kãk-wã

11) jǔ-wãarmadillo-PL
‘armadillos’
A small set of nouns occur with the plural suffix -nit, as illustrated in (12):12) nom–nit
bloodsucker.leech-PL
‘leeches’
The -nit suffix, is used to mark plurality for a small set of nouns that are
conceived as belonging to a group or as moving in groups or bands. Note that this is
not necessarily a group of smaller animals like leeches or mosquitos, but also
includes larger animals such as monkeys (though never human beings, or large
animals like tapirs, or jaguars), as in (13) below:
13) nakni
‘monkey (generic)’vs.nak-nit‘monkeys’Position 4: Possessive suffix -ǐʔ
This position is filled by the possessive suffix -ǐʔ. Possession of nouns in
Kakua is marked on the dependent element of the possessive construction, i.e. the
possessive suffix is attached to the possessor.

Possession is not marked twice. Thus, if a proclitic pronoun precedes the

nouns. Positions 6 onwards are filled by enclitics that are not exclusive to the noun
word, and can be added to other parts of speech. These enclitics, which are not part
of the noun grammatical word, are presented below since they represent a part of the
phonological word for nouns. They are presented here to show the order in which
each of these enclitics attach to the nouns.1
Position 6: Case markers
Case markers in Kakua are enclitics that indicate object case, locative case,
and comitative/instrumental case. Case marking and grammatical relations are

The first enclitic that can attach immediately after the noun word is a mood
marker, which can attach to non-verbal predicates. This position is filled by sentential1See Chapter 3, section §3.1.2 for a description of the placement of clitics and constituency.","[153, 154, 155, 156]"
"352 A Grammar of Kakua13.3 Switch reference markers
13.3.0 Introduction
Kakua has two clitics which may indicate the maintenance or switch of
subject referents across clauses. These markers are not obligatory. However, the
criteria conditioning their occurrence have not yet been explored. They also have
some exceptional uses which likewise have not been explored in detail yet. Therefore
the description provided in the following sections must be regarded as preliminary.
These clitics are used both in main and subordinate clauses. The forms, also given
in Table 13.1 above, are: different subject =tʃaʔ ‘D.S’, and same subject =nit ‘S.S’.4
These clitics attach not only to verbs, but to other parts of speech as well (e.g.,
pronouns (15) below). Likewise, switch reference clitics in Kakua are not restricted
to subordinate clauses, as they occur also in combination with main clauses (see
examples below). These switch reference markers can be used to mark adverbial
clauses. Such an adverbial use of the switch reference markers seems to be, according
to van Gijn et al. (2011:8ff), a common strategy in South American languages. The
present section aims to show the semantics of the switch reference markers, and does
not particularly focus on the adverbial uses of these markers.","[372, 373]"
"3.3.1 Pronouns
In this section I describe the pronominal paradigm in Kakua. This section is
intended as an overview only; for a detailed description and discussion of Kakua’s
pronominal forms and the pronominal system see Chapter 7.
Kakua has distinct forms for free and bound personal pronouns. Free
pronouns can function as arguments without the need for extra affixes. The bound
pronouns (proclitics) always precede a noun or verb. When cliticized to nouns, the
bound pronouns express possessors. When cliticized to verbs, the bound pronouns
function as cross-referencing proclitics of the subject argument of the clause. Unlike
the free pronouns, bound pronouns do not have tone specification by default and
instead their tone value is assigned by the elements following the bound pronoun.
Pronouns functioning as subject or object arguments of a clause take case
markers.",[132]
"10.4.1 Declarative mood =na
The declarative marker in Kakua expresses an assertion without indicating
the reasons for that assertion or the speaker’s commitment to it (as in the definition
of declaratives given in Palmer 2001:64). It is, in terms of Palmer (2001:64), an
“unqualified assertion”. This characterization of the semantics of the declarative
marker in Kakua also implies that a proposition marked with the declarative mood
can be further specified by modality in order to convey the speaker’s commitment
to it.
In Kakua the declarative marker can co-occur with some evidential markers,
as long as they encode, by themselves, a certain degree of assertion. Such is the case
of the reported evidential clitic =wɨt ‘REP.EVID’, in which the degree of assertion is
entirely a third party’s responsibility (see examples below).
The declarative marker in Kakua is the clitic =na ‘DECL’, and although its
most common host is the predicate (verb; as in Table 10.4 above), the declarative
marker can also attach to other parts of speech such as nouns, pronouns,Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality283demonstratives (43), particles (45) and (46),6 and nominalized or adjectivized verbs
(44):

restricted to main clauses, as illustrated in the following example. Note that the
declarative marker occurs on the elements of the subordinated clause: 7

3SG.M=HAB-take-finish
‘he would always take everything, that which they grinded and left, that which
they rotted (manioc), that which they drink (beer)’
Assessments can refer to situations in the future or the past. Because of this,
the declarative marker can also co-occur with markers of tense distinctions. This is
illustrated in the following examples:
6Note cases such as the one in (45), where the declarative enclitic occurs twice. Cases like this
are not explained in this grammar and future research is necessary to understand this phenomenon.
7
This is a very intriguing syntactic distribution of the declarative marker, occurring in
subordinate clauses even when not necessarily conveying reported speech. Perhaps an explanation for this
strange occurrence in subordinate clauses can be found in other semantic values that the declarative
marker can convey. For example, as implied above, the declarative marker can also convey some kind of
evidentiality value (i.e., that of an ‘unqualified assertion), as opposed to strictly functioning as a
declarative marker. In this sense, the declarative marker in Kakua would have properties of both illocution
and modality markers, blurring the line between these two type of mood markers.","[303, 304]"
"Elements of the noun phrase7.3219DemonstrativesKakua has a demonstrative system which makes three distinctions: proximate,
distal, and immediate proximate. The forms of demonstratives are given in Table 7.4
below:
Table 7.4 Kakua demonstrative pronouns
FunctionkanProximate ‘there/this’kun ~ kǔn ~ nunDistal ‘that’
Immediate
proximateForm Demonstrative Pronounmasculine ‘this right
here’
feminine ‘this right
here’nin
ninʔThe proximate and distal demonstrative forms, kan and kun respectively, can
be specified for gender if necessary (unlike immediate proximate forms, which are
already inflected for feminine gender in their basic form). In such cases, the classifier
-wili may be suffixed to the demonstrative form as follows: kan-wili ‘this (female)’,
and kun-wili ‘that (female)’.
Additionally, the 3rd person singular feminine personal pronoun, kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’,
can be used as a demonstrative when referring to female animate beings that are
(spatially) proximate to the speaker, and in such cases it is preferred over kan-wili.
As mentioned in §7.1 above regarding the 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’, both kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kan ‘PROX.DEM’ can be used with the same deictic
meaning. It is also possible that the proximate demonstrative form kan was the
historical source of the pronominal forms kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ (following a
crosslinguistically common development of 3 rd person pronouns from
demonstrative), but the pronominal forms include further phonological
specifications, which suggests that a reverse development might also be possible.
The proximate demonstrative kan ‘PROX.DEM’ is used to refer to objects
which are spatially close to speaker, to the hearer or to both. It is not used for objects
immediately next to the speaker, for which the immediate proximate demonstrative,
nin or ninʔ, is used. The proximate demonstrative is also used to refer to something
that has already been mentioned in the discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this
aforementioned’ object. The proximate demonstrative can be translated as English
‘this’ or ‘there’, and is glossed as such where appropriate:

The proximate demonstrative form is a common variant of the third person
singular pronouns kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’, and can function in any grammatical
role in a clause: subject, object, or adjunct:

from the speaker, hearer, or both (32). Its alternate forms are kǔn and nun. The use
of the distal demonstrative is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture signaling
towards the (imagined, in the case of stories, for example) location of the referred
entity. The referent can be either visible or not visible to speaker and hearer. This
distal demonstrative has an alternate form nun as shown in Table 7.4 above. The
criteria conditioning the use of one over the other seem to correspond to clan dialectal
variation but need to be investigated further.
