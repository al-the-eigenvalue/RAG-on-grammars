9.1 Basic word order
Yurok word order is ﬂexible. It is often possible to arrange the words in the same sentence in two or more different ways, all of them quite acceptable. The order that speakers
choose may depend more on emphasis and the nature of their conversation or story than
on purely syntactic rules. But several clear patterns can be noted here.","[118, 119, 120]"

"LBy 1902 (ALK)QuestionsQuestions are of the following two types:
• In a yes–no question, there are only a couple of natural answers. For example, thelikely answers to the English question Will you help me? are either Yes or No (or some
expansion or equivalent).
• In a content question, the range of likely answers is broader. For example, given theEnglish question Who will help me?, there are numerous possible answers depending
on the circumstances: Alice, Bert, Charlie, Donna, etc.
In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions are formed in different
ways. In English, for example, content questions use a word such as where?, what?,
why?, etc., while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order: Can you hear
me? Yurok too has two different methods for forming the two types of questions.",[123]
"MM 1927 (ES)
FS 1980 (PP)In contrast, adverbs, even those with generally similar meanings, may be positioned
before or after verbs. For example, in (150), the adverbs chmeyaan “yesterday”, ’owook
“tomorrow”, and wonekw “above” occupy a position before the verb (and before the preverbs) in two sentences, and after the verb in two others.
(150) Adverb position
(a) Wonekw ’o soonekw kue laas.
“The trail goes uphill.”
(b) Chmeyaan neskwechook’ mehl Kohpey.
“Yesterday I came from Crescent City.”
(c) Kue pegerk no’p’en’ meweehl chmeyaan.
“The man chased an elk yesterday.”
(d) Kee lahchue’ so Kohpey ’owook.
“A voyage will be made to Crescent City tomorrow.”
Preverbs never show the word order ﬂexibility of adverbs.",[120]
"xx/GlossaryObject. Some verbs have an object as well as a subject; the object is the person or thing
affected or targeted by the action. In English, for example, that rock is the object
in the sentences I saw that rock and I threw that rock.
Plural. A plural noun or verb refers to more than one person or thing (in the case of
verbs, usually the subject but occasionally the object).
Preﬁx. A preﬁx is a piece of a longer word that is added to the beginning of the word,
such as English un- in unhappy) or Yurok ’ne- in ’ne-’yoch “my boat”.
Singular. A singular noun or verb refers to one person or thing (in the case of verbs,
usually the subject but occasionally the object).
Subject. Almost every verb has a subject: the person or thing that does the action,
or that experiences or undergoes the state expressed by the verb. In English, for
example, that rock is the subject in the sentences Yesterday that rock fell on my car
and That rock was big.
Suﬃx. A suﬃx is a piece of a longer word that is added to the end of the word, such as
English -ness in happiness or Yurok -ek’ in skewokseemek’ “I like it”.
Transitive verb. A transitive verb is a verb that requires an object and a subject. See
§2.1 on page 17. An English example is see; a Yurok example is newook’ “I see it”.
Verb. See §2.1 on page 17.","[26, 27]"
"Word classes/19Both inﬂected and non-inﬂected verbs can be classiﬁed according to transitivity,
which refers to the number of obligatory participants implied by their meaning. The
options can be summarized as follows.
• An intransitive verb has a subject but no object. Yurok examples are kepoyuerek’ “Iswim” and knewolepek’ “I am tall”.
• A transitive verb has a subject and an object. Yurok examples are ko’moyok’ “I hear it”and nooluemek’ “I love her or him”.
• A ditransitive verb has a subject and two objects. These verbs usually refer to givingor transfer, where one object is the thing given and the other is the recipient (the person
to whom it is given). A Yurok example is nahchek’ “I give it to her or him”.
• An impersonal verb has no subject or object. These verbs usually refer to the weatheror similar situations. A Yurok example is rook’ws “it’s windy”.
For more information about Yurok verbs see chapters 5–6 and 11–25.","[49, 50]"
"2.3 Nouns
A noun is a kind of word that can be the subject or object of a verb, or the object of a
preposition; nouns typically refer to people, places, things, events, substances, or qualities. English nouns include boy, creek, boat, water, and happiness; Yurok nouns include
mewah “young boy”, raak “creek”, and ’yoch “boat”. (Abstract concepts tend to be expressed
as verbs in Yurok, not nouns.) For more information about Yurok nouns see chapter 3.",[50]
"GT 2003 (YLCB)LT 1922 (GR)GT 2003 (YLCB)YL 1951FS 1980 (PP)Questions that ask “what?”, as in (165), use the question word tee’neeshoo. As a rule,
tee’neeshoo questions are used with verbs that ordinarily have a noun as their (missing)
subject or object. In (165c), the missing noun is understood with mehl “about”.
(165) Questions with tee’neeshoo
(a)Tee’neeshoo kee nepem’?
“What are you going to eat?”",[126]
"Grammatical description
Non-inﬂected verbs are identiﬁed as such. For other verbs, verb class (e-class, aa-class,
o-class, or oo-class) is identiﬁed. For information about non-inﬂected verbs, see §5.2 on
page 38 above. For information about verb classes, see §5.3–§5.4 beginning on page 40.
For oo-class verbs, the 3rd person singular ending (-ok’w, -om’, or -o’) is identiﬁed.
For information about these endings, see §5.3 beginning on page 40.
Finally, impersonal verbs are identiﬁed as such. For all other verbs, transitivity status
(intransitive, transitive, or optionally transitive) is identiﬁed. These terms are deﬁned
here:
• intransitive. An intransitive verb has only a subject, and no object; for these terms seethe Glossary beginning on page xix. Examples are English run and Yurok ro’opek’ “I run”.
• transitive. A transitive verb has both a subject and an object. Examples are English seeand Yurok newook’ “I see it”.
• ditransitive. A ditransitive verb has a subject and two objects. Most ditransitive verbsare verbs of transfer, like English give (for example, I gave her a book, with two objects
her and a book). A Yurok ditransitive verb is nahchek’ “I give it to her/him”.
• optionally transitive. An optionally transitive verb can be intransitive or transitive.",[144]
"2.4 Pronouns
A pronoun is a kind of word that stands in place of a noun. It may be the subject or object
of a verb, for example, but its reference may differ from sentence to sentence, depending
on context. English pronouns include words like me, that, and what. Yurok pronouns are
of three types:
• personal pronouns refer to “I”, “you”, “me”, etc.: nek, kel’, nekah, kelew, etc.
• demonstrative pronouns refer to a third person, that is, “s/he”, “that one”, “them”, etc.:yo’, wee’eeet, etc.
• question (or interrogative) pronouns include words like kues “how?”, tee’now “who?”,tee’neeshoo “what?”, and other words in forming content questions (§9.3.2).",[50]
"2.1 Verbs
Verbs in the broad sense actually consist of two distinct word classes.
A verb (in the narrow sense) is a kind of word that changes its form depending on
its subject (and possibly its object), and that prototypically expresses an activity or state.
English verbs include know, run, sing. A Yurok verb that changes form is illustrated by
the following selection of forms:
• komchuemek’ “I know it”
• komchuem’ “he or she knows it”
• komchuechek’ “I know you”
• komchuepa’ “you know me”
• komchuesek’ “I know her or him”A non-inflected verb is a kind of verb (in the broad sense) that does not change
form; it is not “inﬂected” according to the subject. For example, without changing form,
the Yurok non-inﬂected verb skewok “like, want” can be used in expressions like nek skewok “I want”, kel’ skewok “you want”, or yo’ skewok “he or she wants”. For more information
see §5.2.",[48]
"6.1 Passive verbs
Most transitive verbs (verbs that have objects as well as subjects) have a set of passive forms.¹ These can be used to indicate that the speaker does not know who the
(ordinary) subject of the verb is, or does not care, or generally that the discourse is
oriented toward the object and not the subject. Yurok passives are broadly equivalent to
English sentences like I was hit with a rock or Mistakes were made, but often the best
translation is “somebody did (the verbal action)”.",[80]
"Additional verb types/51Figure 6.1: Aileen Figueroa and Jimmie James at the 2006 Yurok Language Celebration. Both Mrs. Figueroa
and Mr. James used Yurok in their homes and taught the language to family members and in classes.am seen” is the one who sees. In many examples, like those in (50), passive verbs are
used when the basic subject is unknown or of no special interest in context.
(50)(a)Keech ho’omohtkoyek’.
“I’ve been hurt.”","[81, 82]"
"FS 1951 (YL)In cases like (51), the basic subject is known but the focus of attention is the participant who is affected by the action. This is especially common for plural basic subjects
that might be translated as “they” or “people” (in general).
(51)(a)Hesem’ hes newoyem’?
“Do you think they see you?”
(lit. “Do you think you were seen?”)AF 2001 (JB)(b) Keech syaahlkoyem’ hes?
“Did they kick you?”
(lit. “Were you kicked?”)AF 2001 (JB)(c) Keech nuemee sya’syaahlkoyek’.
“They keep kicking me.”
(lit. “I am really being repeatedly kicked.”)AF 2001 (JB)52/Additional verb typesAs illustrated in (52), passives are also sometimes used when the basic subject is
overtly expressed — kue puesee “that cat” in (52a) and kue meges “the doctor” in (52b).
Typically, in such cases the focus of attention is not the basic subject but the participant
who is affected by the action.
(52)6.2(a) Newook’ kue puesee sesomenoyem’.
“I saw that cat scratch you.”
(lit. “I saw you scratched (by) that cat.”)
(b) Kue meges keech meskwoyek’.
“The doctor is treating me with medicine.”
(lit. “I am being treated with medicine (by) the doctor.”)AF 2001 (LJC)AG 2007 (AG)Bipersonal verbsWhile the verbs discussed above have endings that indicate the subject, Yurok also has
verbs with endings that indicate both the subject and the object. These are called bipersonal verbs, and can be used when the object of the verb refers to a person (or an animal
behaving like a person, for example in a story). Examples are in (53–54). The verbs in
(53) all end in -chek’ and involve a subject “I” and an object “you”, such as ko’moyochek’
“I hear you” in (53a).
(53)(a) Nek ko’moyochek’.
“I heard you.”
(b) Nekee’ meskwochek’.
“I’m treating you with medicine.”
(c) Kee ’orechek’.
“I’m going to owe you money.”","[82, 83]"
"Chapter 4Articles and pronouns
Articles and pronouns belong to different word classes, as discussed in chapter 2, but
they nonetheless share an important feature of meaning. Both can express meaning distinctions that involve proximity and distance, such as “near” vs. “far”, or “this” vs. “that”.¹4.1 Pronouns
4.1.1 Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns in Yurok are words that refer to speakers and addressees — the equivalent of English I, me, and you. Table 4.1 lists the personal pronouns that are documented
in Modern Yurok.²1st person
2nd personsingularpluralcontrastiveobjectivenek

kelachTable 4.1: Modern Yurok personal pronouns
The singular pronouns nek “I, me” and kel’ “you” and their plural counterparts nekah
“we, us” and kelew “you” are very common. They are not simply the equivalent of the
English subject pronouns I and you. In addition to being used as subjects of sentences,
they are used as objects of prepositions like ho, mehl, and ’o. This is illustrated in (21).

In any language, words can be grouped into various classes, which are deﬁned partly by
their meaning and partly by how they are used in sentences. It is useful to identify the
word classes of a language because then you can make general statements about them,
such as “Yurok nouns do not usually change according to whether they are singular or
plural” and “Yurok preverbs are positioned before the verb”.
Though there are many similarities across languages, word classes do differ from
language to language. For example, English has a class of adjectives; Yurok does not.
In Yurok, the meanings that are expressed by English adjectives are instead expressed
by the class of verbs. Likewise, English has no class of preverbs despite the importance
of this word class in Yurok grammar. English also lacks non-inflected verbs.
Every Yurok word belongs to one of the ten word classes below.","[46, 47, 48]"
"Chapter 7Time reference with preverbs
Basic time reference is expressed in Yurok by preverbs and preverb combinations. It is
also possible to use adverbs of time, words like chmeyaan “yesterday”, we’yk’oh “now”,
and ’owook “tomorrow”. These do not need to be pre-verbal, and they can stand on their
own without a verb. But they supplement the basic system of preverbs, to make time
reference more speciﬁc. The use of the most common preverbs for this purpose is the
subject of this chapter.","[92, 93, 94]"
"FS 1980 (PP)The singular pronouns nek “I” and kel’ “you (sg)” are not used as the objects of verbs
with third-person subjects. As seen in (27), however, plural pronouns like nekah “we,
us” are used in this context.
(27)Yo’hlkoh nekah sermeryerwery.
“They will kill us.”",[64]
"Chapter 5Basic verb formation
Broadly speaking, Yurok verbs are of two types:
• non-inflected verbs do not change their form depending on the subject or object. Theyare described in §5.2.
• inflected verbs, do change their form, depending on whether their subjects are ﬁrstperson (“I, we”), second person (“you”), etc. They require much more discussion.
Every inﬂected verb belongs to one of four verb classes. The four classes are named
according to the vowel that sometimes appears before the ending:
• e-class verbs
• o-class verbs
• oo-class verbs
• aa-class verbsAll four classes are described here in general terms. For details about individual verbs,
consult Part II beginning on page 113 below. This includes information about usage and
the forms of many common verbs. In general, when you learn a verb, you should learn
its class (and its subclass if it is an oo-class verb), whether its usual plural is collective,
whether it has any irregular forms, and its usage patterns.","[67, 68]"
"6.4.1 Forming subjunctives
The subjunctive preﬁxes and endings are shown in Table 6.7 on page 55. The forms in
this table have preﬁxes; their endings make singular forms look like 1 sg verbs, but preﬁxes disambiguate key forms. Examples of subjunctive clauses (underlined) with skewok
are given in (55) for statements and in (56) for questions.
¹ Subjunctive verbs were called pronominal-prefix verbs in R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958; for the
full reference see the Bibliography on page 299). A subjunctive non-inﬂected verb is in fact indistinguishable
from a possessed noun; the word ’ue-pa’ah may be interpreted as “for it to be wet” (non-inﬂected verb) or
“its water” (noun). An alternative linguistic term for subjunctives might be subordinative, because they are
associated with subordinate clauses.",[85]

Classical and Modern Yurok
It is sometimes good to distinguish the usage patterns of two sets of Yurok speakers at
different times. The dates given below are somewhat arbitrary, since in every period of
a language there are always some speakers who use an older style and others who use a
newer style.
Classical Yurok. This term refers to the usage of Yurok speakers recorded in the ﬁrst
half or two thirds of the 20th century, those born before about 1900–1910. (These
include Lowana Brantner, Florence Shaughnessy, Robert Spott, and many other
people.)
Modern Yurok. This term refers to the usage of Yurok speakers recorded late in the
20th century and early in the 21st century, those born after about 1900–1910.
(These include the most active teachers of the last generation.)Terminology
You do not need to know special terminology to speak a language. Yurok children learned
their language perfectly, and elders spoke masterfully and subtly in the language, for
centuries with no linguists. But linguistic terminology is helpful if you want to talk about
the structure or the use of a language.
1st, 2nd, 3rd person. Verbs have ﬁrst-, second-, and third-person forms: 1st person
means that the subject is “I” or “we”; 2nd person means that the subject is “you”
(singular or plural); and 3rd person means that the subject is “he”, “she”, “it”, or
“they”.
Impersonal verb. An impersonal verb is a verb that has no subject; the usual impersonal verbs concern weather and other situations that need not involve any participants. See §2.1 on page 17. A Yurok example is tenpewe’hl “it is raining”.
Intransitive verb. An intransitive verb is a verb that has a subject but no object. See
§2.1 on page 17. An English example is walk; a Yurok example is ro’opek’ “I run”.
Noun. See §2.3 on page 19.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"

9Table 10.1: Selected numerals from 1 to 10 (q = question “How many?”)10.3Numerals and color termsWords used for counting things (“one”, “two”, etc.) and words used to describe colors
(“light-colored”, “red”, etc.) are mostly verbs in Yurok. (Recall that Yurok, unlike English,
does not have any adjectives.) The most commonly-used forms are attributive verbs
and non-inflected verbs.
A distinctive feature of Yurok numerals and color terms is that they change form
depending on the meaning of what they are applied to; a different form of “two” or “lightcolored” is used for snakes and for human beings. This is a classificatory system; it
is how Yurok organizes phenomena in the world. Numerals show more different forms
than color terms in Yurok, but both are classiﬁcatory.",[137]
"FS 1951 (RHR)
FS 1951 (RHR)
YL 1951
FS 1951 (RHR)Finally, Table 4.1 includes two objective pronouns nekach and kelach. These are
used when the object of a verb is “me” or “you (sg)” and the verb has a third-person
subject. Given in (24) are two examples with ordinary transitive verbs and the objective
pronoun kelach “you (sg)”.
(24)Examples of objective kelach “you (sg)”
(a) To’ hes kelach skewok kue mewasegoh?
“Do the boys like you?”
(b) Yo’ kelach ’o noo’rep’.
“He followed you there.”",[63]
"12/The sounds of Yurok1.2Major differences between English and YurokWhen you learn a second language as an adult, your ﬁrst language always inﬂuences
your new language. For example, usually you have an accent in your second language;
you do not sound like somebody who grew up speaking that language. To reduce your
accent and what you carry over from your ﬁrst language, it can be helpful to focus on
major differences between the two languages.
Six major differences between English and Yurok are described here; if you pay attention to these differences, your Yurok may sound less English-inﬂuenced. You can hear
recordings of most words below on the Yurok Language Project website (linguistics.
berkeley.edu/~yurok).","[42, 43]"
"MM 1927 (ES)
FS 1951 (YL)With verbs that are inconsistent with motion, as in (147), the meaning of neenee is that
multiple subjects or multiple objects are located in a variety of places.
(147) Examples of neenee “(multiple subjects or objects being) around”
(a) Wee’ neenee rek’eeen ’ue-kahchuuem’.
“They’re sitting around sewing.”
FS 1980 (PP)
(b) To’ cho’ neenee neee’nowom’.
“You should look around.”
DW 1906 (ALK)
Second, neenee expresses comparison and can be translated “more”, as in (148).
(148) Comparative neenee
(a) Cho’ neenee plerrsem’.
“Talk louder.”
(b) Nek neenee chey ’o kel’.
“I am younger than you.”",[118]
"Part IBasic grammarChapter 1The sounds of Yurok
1.1 Writing and pronunciation
The principle of the basic sound, which linguists call the phoneme, underlies the writing
of a language and its sound patterns. In every language, sounds can be arranged into a
set of phonemes or basic sounds. Sometimes a phoneme is pronounced in only one
way in a language; or a single phoneme may have two or more different pronunciations
depending on its position in the word, or on nearby sounds.¹ In what follows, the writing
system to be described is phonemic in the sense that each basic Yurok sound has a
unique spelling (which may consist of more than one letter, such as ch, er, or eee).","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
"7.4 Future time: Modal kee
The modal future preverb kee can mean that the action described by the verb will take
place sometime in the future, but it also commonly means that the subject of the verb
can or must do the action described by the verb. In other words, future reference is only
a(n implied) part of the meaning of this preverb. A few examples that can be translated
as future are in (92).
(92)Examples of kee “will”
(a)Perwerh kee sootook’.
“I will go south.”",[102]
"114/Verb overviewRelated verbs
Closely related verbs are sometimes shown. This means other verbs derived from the
same root, but differing in form, meaning, or usage. This will often include non-inﬂected
verbs. Examples of groups of closely related verbs include the verbs in (203) and the
verbs in (204). Within these groups, non-inﬂected megetohl in (203) and myah in (204)
are the most common individual forms. You will ﬁnd them listed under megetohlkwook’
(page 274) and myaahlkepek’ (page 229).
(203)Verbs related to megetohlkwook’ “I take care of it”
(a) megetohl “take care of’
(b) megetohlkwepek’ “I take care of myself’(204)Verbs related to myaahlkook’ “I jump”
(a) myah “jump”
(b) myaahlkepek’ “I jump”
(c) myaahlkahpeemek’ “I jump on him”Meaning and usage
Information about how a verb is used, and what it means, is always given, with example
sentences.
Verbs with similar meanings
It can be helpful to know how a verb differs from other verbs with similar meanings.
For example, hohkuemek’, serrhlerperk’, and sonowok’ can all sometimes be translated as
“do”. An attempt is made to explain the differences in such cases.
Inﬂected forms
Every inﬂected verb in Yurok has numerous possible forms. Many of these are given for
reference in the chapters that follow. Essential grammatical terminology is explained
in chapter 5, beginning on page 37; see also the Glossary of terminology and symbols,
beginning on page xix.
For all verbs, ordinary (indicative) forms are given, and in most cases subjunctive,
attributive, and imperative forms. For many verbs, collective plurals are included. For
transitive verbs, passive and bipersonal forms are often given.
Readers should note that not every form cited here has been documented. In fact,
most of the forms cited have not been documented, but are presented according to the
regular grammatical patterns of the Yurok language. On page 121, for example, the 1 pl
subjunctive of hohkuemek’ “I make” is given as ’n-ohkuemoh even though this precise
form has not been recorded. But other subjunctive forms are documented, and the formation of 1 pl subjunctives is quite regular as far as is known.
The use of predictable but undocumented forms is not desirable; ideally, every word
in a book like this would be checked with a ﬂuent ﬁrst-language speaker. But this is unfortunately no longer possible. Academic researchers and others who prefer to make use
of only those forms that were actually documented from a ﬂuent ﬁrst-language speaker
should consult the corpus of Yurok data at linguistics.berkeley.edu/~yurok.","[144, 145]"
"Acknowledgements
We would not know what we know about Yurok without the patient work of ﬂuent
speakers who never stopped teaching their language. I had the good fortune to learn
from ’aawokw Aileen Figueroa, Jimmie James, Glenn Moore, Sr., Archie Thompson, and
Georgiana Trull. I have also spent many hours listening to, and reading transcripts of,
the voices of other Yurok speakers, including the elders of a century and longer ago;
those of the mid-twentieth century, such as Lowana Brantner, Frank Douglas, Florence
Shaughnessy, Alice Spott, and Robert Spott; and many others. All of them generously
shared their knowledge so their language can endure with its people.
Also essential have been linguists of earlier generations who worked with ﬂuent
speakers to document Yurok, carefully studied aspects of its grammar, and published
valuable analyses of its patterns. The most important of these linguists is R. H. Robins,
whose book The Yurok language (1958) contains key observations on every page; this
book makes constant use of what he learned from Florence Shaughnessy and other
Yurok elders. Also invaluable is the work of Howard Berman, A. L. Kroeber, Paul Proulx,
Edward Sapir, and T. T. Waterman. These scholars created a lasting analytic framework
for the study of Yurok grammar.
This book is intended for members of the Yurok community — language learners and
teachers — and is a direct result of their support and inspiration. Participants in the Yurok
Language Institute and grammar workshops have made helpful comments and suggestions on grammar, handouts, and drafts of part of this book; they include Tammy Cairns,
Leo Canez, Georgiana Gensaw, Robert R. Kinney, Kate Lowry, Skip Lowry, Chelsea
Reed, Margo Robbins, Bessie Shorty, Britty Vigil, Lawrence Williams, and others. The
Yurok Tribe language program staff over the years — Victoria Carlson, James Gensaw,
Barbara McQuillen, Kathleen Vigil, and their colleagues and interns — are good friends
and engaging teachers. Long-time Yurok language teacher Kay Inong has played an important role in creating a language curriculum that informs the choice of topics covered
in this book. The Yurok Tribe language program poy ’we-son, Carole Lewis, deserves special mention for her hard work and long-term vision in creating a program that inspires
communities throughout California. Thanks also to activist, artist, and Yurok language
teacher Annelia Hillman for kindly contributing original artwork to this book.
Without two friends who changed my career, I would never have worked with the
Yurok language. Leanne Hinton introduced me to California language documentation
and revitalization, and has offered unstinting support. Juliette Blevins introduced me to
Yurok itself, persuaded me that a philologist could play a role in the community, and
talked with me for years about the grammar of the language. I am forever grateful toxxii/Acknowledgementsboth of them.
My colleagues Lisa Conathan, James Martin, Line Mikkelsen, Alysoun Quinby, Ruth
Rouvier, Justin Spence, and Tess Wood have greatly improved my understanding of
Yurok grammar with ideas and work that have made a difference throughout this book.

This book is meant to be used by Yurok language teachers and advanced learners, in
support of language restoration in the Yurok community. That goal has determined the
contents and style of what follows. Linguists and other scholars may ﬁnd this useful
as well, but should be aware that it is not an academic reference grammar. All readers
should keep in mind that languages are best learned by speaking and listening; this is a
supplement to the spoken language.
This is a combination, expansion, and revision of two earlier publications, Yurok verb
guide: 75 common verbs (2009, 78 pages) and Basic Yurok grammar (2010, 69 pages).
Those earlier books are completely superseded by this one; substantial content has been
added and signiﬁcant errors have been corrected.
Part I (chapters 1–10) provides information about the sounds of Yurok and about
basic grammatical and vocabulary patterns. Many were identiﬁed by the Yurok Tribe
for teacher certiﬁcation purposes. Part II (chapters 11–25) introduces the meanings and
forms of the most common Yurok verbs. Over 200 different verbs are covered, in 117
numbered sections. Because Yurok verbs tend to pack more information into them than
English verbs, Yurok verbs usually have many different forms, indicating participants
in the action and sometimes also relations to other verbs in the sentence. Some Yurok
verbs have dozens of different forms. This makes a guide useful.
Other grammatical topics are discussed only brieﬂy (such as some of the preverbs),
or are omitted entirely (such as reﬂexive and reciprocal verbs, locative forms of nouns,
and many sentence patterns). Advanced learners and teachers may consult R. H. Robins’s
1958 book The Yurok language: Grammar, texts, lexicon, written in a technical style for
linguists, and other linguistic publications. See the Bibliography on pages 299–300 for
details.

"2.6ParticlesThe term particle refers to a set of ﬁve different word classes which share two features:
all of them have relatively few words, ranging from only two articles to a few dozen
preverbs; and in all cases they cannot be used on their own to form utterances. Particles
occur only with other words. For example, since you can answer a question with just
an adverb, an adverb is not a particle: if someone asks where you’re going, you can just
answer lekwsee “outside”. A noun is not a particle because if someone asks what you want
to eat, you can say nepuy “salmon” by itself. But you cannot say words like keetee, ’ochkaa,
k’ee, or kwelekw on their own without being part of a larger phrase or sentence. The ﬁve
Yurok word classes that can be regarded as particles are detailed in §§2.6.1–2.6.5.",[51]

with ﬁrst-person and second-person subjects. This is in contrast with keetee, which simply expresses a prediction about the future, and is typical with impersonal verbs or verbs
with inanimate subjects.
Second, whereas keetee is often associated with a prediction for the near future or an
impending event, and can thus often be translated “about to”, kee carries no such implication. For example, in (105), the syntactic context in each case makes the time of the
verb with kee entirely indeﬁnite.

Chapters 12–25 present detailed information concerning over 200 Yurok verbs. All are
common; many are essential in everyday speech. They were chosen because of their
frequency or importance in language use. The verbs included are also organized by verb
class in Tables 11.1–11.4 on pages 116–117.
Beginning in chapter 12, each chapter lists the most common verbs in a single area
of meaning. Several types of information are given for each verb, as follows.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

YL 19518.2 Negation: Using mos and neemee
English negative sentences usually have not or -n’t. Yurok negative sentences are usually
formed with the words in (117).
(117) Yurok negative words
(a) the ordinary negative preverb neemee, or (especially in Classical Yurok) its
variants mee, ’eemee, and keemee “will not”
(b) the emphatic negative particle mos (and a rare longer variant mosee’)
Note that neemee is a preverb that occurs before the verb together with other preverbs,
while mos is a discourse particle that occurs, like to’, at the beginning of a sentence. In
texts and spontaneous language use by ﬂuent speakers, in the expression of negation
neemee is more common; mos occurs in an important but restricted set of situations.",[110]
"The sounds of Yurok(2)/9Tense e
(a) Repetitive verbs: slekwslekw “put clothes on”, tekwtekwsook’ “I cut it up”,
tektekon’ “it’s sticky”
(b) Nouns and non-inﬂected verbs: chekwchem “black acorns”, keget “mountain
lion”, keychek “tired”, kweget “visit”, legech “mudhen”, segep “coyote”Tense e is spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet, but is not the same sound as the combination of e plus y. That combination occurs in words like cheykenee “small”, and is also
spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet.
Third, in all other contexts (wherever open and tense e are not used), the lax pronunciation is used. Lax e is the same as the vowel sound of English head.
Open and tense e only occur in stressed syllables and only in adverbs, interjections,
nouns, pronouns, and verbs — not in the various particle word classes (see §2.6). Otherwise, there are very few exceptions to the rules above; one common exception is hesek’,
whose ﬁrst syllable has a lax vowel rather than the tense vowel.
The relationships among the variant pronunciations of e can clearly be seen when
the same vowel, in a related word, undergoes a change because its word position has
changed. Several such examples are in (3–6). In each case, the ﬁrst word has a tense e
that becomes open e in the related second word. For example, in each verb pair in (3),
the ﬁrst form is a 1 sg verb with tense e in the initial syllable and the second form is the
corresponding 3 sg verb with an open e.
(3)Tense e → Open e: Verb pairs
(a) chkeyek’ “I sleep” → chkey’ “s/he sleeps”
(b) nekek’ “I put it” → nek’ “s/he puts it”
(c) nepek’ “I eat” → nep’ “s/he eats”In each noun pair in (4), the ﬁrst form is a full noun with tense e in the initial syllable
and the second form is the corresponding short form with an open e (on short forms see
§3.4 beginning on page 27).
(4)Tense e → Open e: Noun pairs
(a) lewet “net” → ’ne-lew “my net”
(b) ’leptoyhl “hair” → ’ne-’lep “my hair”
(c) pekcheech “rope” → ’ue-pek “his or her rope”
(d) ’ne-k’ep’ch’em → ’ne-k’ep’ “my daughter-in-law”In each word pair in (5), the ﬁrst word is a longer noun or verb with tense e in the
initial syllable and the second form is an iterative with an open e (on iteratives see §6.6
beginning on page 59).
(5)Tense e → Open e: Iteratives
(a) meskwoh “medicine” → meges “doctor”
(b) sepolah “prairie” → segep “coyote” (“goes on the prairies”)
(c) tetolo’hl → teget “cry”Finally, in the miscellaneous related word pairs in (6), the ﬁrst example in each case has
tense e in an initial syllable and the second example has open e in a ﬁnal syllable.","[39, 40]"

chapter 4; question pronouns are discussed in §9.3.","[50, 51]"
"YL 1951
WF 1902 (ALK)What is common to all these uses is that something (a manufactured object or a natural
object) is made useful. Note that unlike many transitive verbs, hohkuemek’ requires an
expressed or understood object. To say “I’m working”, you would say Keech kol’ hohkuemek’, not †Keech hohkuemek’.
A further use of hohkuemek’ is to express cause, as in (210) on page 121. In this
construction it is combined with a subjunctive verb to express the equivalent of English
make (somebody do something).
(210)(a)Nek hohkuemek’ kee ’ue-menechook’.
“I make it disappear.”",[152]
"Additional verb types/576.5 Attributive verbs
Every inﬂected Yurok verb has attributive forms. These have distinctive endings and a
set of uses that sometimes correspond to modiﬁers in English, sometimes to nouns, and
sometimes to phrases with meanings like “the one who steals” or “the boy who ran fast”.
The attributive phrases that are formed with attributive verbs can be understood
informally as descriptive phrases; they serve to characterize or describe a noun or a
referent under discussion.¹
The most common patterns for forming attributive verbs are shown in Table 6.8.e-classe-classo-class or

As the table shows, all ﬁrst-person (singular and plural) attributives have an ending
-oh, similar to the 1 pl ending of indicative verbs. Second-person attributives distinguish singular and plural endings, and have different patterns for e-class vs. o- and ooclass verbs. Note that oo-class verbs with 3 sg forms in -ok’w have 3 sg attributives in
-okween. Collective ﬁrst- and second-person attributives are identical to indicatives; the
third-person forms are distinct.
By far the most common attributive forms in use are third-person forms (singular,
plural, and collective). Their use to modify nouns is illustrated in (61–62). Given ﬁrst,
in (61), are examples with the pattern Attributive + Noun.²
(61)Attributive + Noun

“a very big snake” (peloyek’ “I am big”)FS 1980 (PP)AF 2001 (JB)¹ Attributive verbs are used to form what linguists call relative clauses. A relative clause that consists of only
an attributive verb can function like an agent noun, the equivalent of English baker, hunter, etc. Note that
a number of details of attributive formation and usage are omitted here. More information can be found in
R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958) and Howard Berman’s “Subordinate clauses in Yurok: A preliminary
report” (1972); for full references see the Bibliography on page 299.

It is uncommon for a sentence in ordinary usage to have more than one noun, and it is
common for sentences to have no nouns. If there is a noun, it may be positioned either
before or after its verb. As a rule, no more than one noun will be positioned before the
verb. Any others will be positioned after the verb, and it is even possible that all nouns
will be positioned after the verb.
If one noun at most is positioned before the verb, which noun is it? When are nouns
positioned before their verbs? Two general rules about noun position are given in (151).¹
(151)Noun position: Two general rules
(a) A noun is usually before the verb if it is contrastive, emphasized, or new
to the discourse.
(b) A noun is usually after the verb if it conveys old information, or if it is
very long.","[120, 121]"
"10.2.2VM 1994 (BJ)Verbs in son- “how”Verbs that begin with the relative root son- (or its variants sern-, soo-, or serr-) answer
(or ask) the question “how?” They refer to a manner of being or doing, and must be
used with a word or phrase that expresses the manner. For example, as in (191), the
verb serrnerh “be (a particular) color, it is colored (thus)” requires an expression like
won “differently”.
(191)Won nee kee serrnerh k’e-wa’aw.
“Your ﬂoor will be a different color.”",[135]
"10.2Relative rootsYurok has many verbs beginning with no’om-, son-, tom-, or weno’om-, which are called
relative roots.¹ Such verbs have in common that a sentence containing one of them is
incomplete unless a word or phrase is added to express a particular relation implied by
the root. Details differ depending on the initial element, but this general proﬁle is the
same across all four roots.",[135]
"6.1.2 Using passives
The term basic subject may be useful to avoid ambiguity in referring to the subject of
a non-passive verb.² For example, the basic subject of newook’ “I see it” and newoyek’ “I
¹ Note that passive forms like hohkelek’ need not have the unlikely meaning “somebody made or repaired me”
(as if spoken by a boat or house); they could be used in a causative construction with meanings like “somebody
made me (do something)”. For this construction see §12.2 on page 121.
² Linguists might use the term underlying subject.",[81]
"Some examples of the KMPW rule are listed in Table 3.4 on page 25.
Third, a special pattern is found in words beginning with hue- in the third singular
(“his, her, its, their”) form, h is replaced by ’ rather than ’w. A common example is with
huuek “child” and huueksoh “children”: ’n-uuek “my child”, but ’-uuek “his or her child” — in
this word the initial glottal stop (’) is the possessive preﬁx!
A ﬁnal rule that affects possessive preﬁxes has to do with their stress pattern. Usually
the preﬁx is not stressed, and the possessed noun has its usual stress pattern. But for a
small subset of nouns (see §3.3) with one syllable, the preﬁx plus noun are treated as a
single word and the preﬁx is stressed. Examples are listed in (18).",[55]
"6.1.1 Forming passives
The most regular type of passive is formed as follows. For an e-class verb (1 sg -ek’),
the passive is formed in a variety of semi-regular and sometimes irregular ways; often a
suﬃx -el- or -ey- is used. For an o-class or oo-class verb (1 sg -ok’ or -ook’), the passive
is formed in -oye- (1 sg -oyek’). All passive verbs are themselves e-class verbs, whether
they are passives of e-class, o-class, or oo-class verbs. Some of the patterns are illustrated
in Table 6.1 on page 50. The 1 sg forms in this table have the meanings in (48).
(48)(a)myewoletelek’ “I am pushed under the water, somebody pushed me under
the water”¹ To describe these verb forms R. H. Robins used the term passive in his book The Yurok language (1958).
In an article “Pragmatic convergence: Person hierarchies in northern California” (2002), Lisa Conathan has
shown that they are what linguists would now call inverse verb forms; this explains some key differences
from English passives. (For full references see the Bibliography on page 299.) Linguists may wish to note the
following additional analytic point: while Robins treated these as inﬂectional forms of the verbs with which
they are associated here, this may not be the correct analysis. It may instead be the case that “passive” forms
are among a suite of derivationally related verbs with different argument-structure properties.",[80]
"6.3Speciﬁc verb typesSome speciﬁc and common types of verbs have systematically irregular forms. In other
words, though the pattern for a speciﬁc type is irregular (compared with verbs generally), once you know the pattern you can easily form other verbs of that type.",[83]
