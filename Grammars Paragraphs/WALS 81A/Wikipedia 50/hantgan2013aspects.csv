"Word Order11.1 Overview of Word Order
The previous chapters showed that the verb stem is inflected for aspect by vowels following
derivational suffixation. The tense or aspect of a clause is indicated by word order and verb
particles. The word order of a clause in Bangime, the placement of the subject, object, and verb,
changes depending on the tense, aspect, or mood of the phrase. The attested word orders in the
language are SVO, SOV, and OSV for untopicalizationed sentences. The incompletive aspects
are usually SVO, the completive aspects SOV, and the future can be expressed with OSV word
order. These word orders are the defaults, or most commonly expressed, for each TAM
category. The table in (348) presents the default word orders with the particle associated with
each TAM category. The verb particles are discussed in detail in the previous chapter

ha=258Each verb particle except for the completive precedes the verb stem. The particles which
precede the stem are also more closely tied to the stem in that other words may not intervene.
The object follows the verb directly in a perfective construction and the perfective particle
appears clause-finally. The incompletive categories (348a) are usually in SOV order, and the
completed categories are SVO (348b) and the future tense may be either SOV or OSV (319c).
Some verbs may deviate from the default word order to indicate topicalization.
This chapter is organized by word order category: the tense, aspects, and moods which
are expressed through the SVO word order are shown in §11.2. In §11.3, the SOV tense, aspect,
and moods are discussed. Section 11.4 presents the future tense, which is indicated by OSV
word order. The passive mood is indicated by the OSV word order and is mentioned in §11.5.
Then, in §11.6 a brief discussion of the effect of topicalization on word order is presented.
11.2 Subject-Verb-Object
Forms denoting the completive aspects have subject-verb-object as the default word order. The
irrealis mood also has S-V-O word order.
11.2.1 Perfective
Perfective aspect is marked by a verb suffix vowel and occurs with SVO word order, with the
TAM marking and the person tonal marking on the verb. 50 The sentences in (349) - (351) are
representative of the perfective aspect.

there are few verbs which have transitive-intransitive counterparts.
1.8.3SyntaxIn the syntactic category of Bangime grammar, the attributes of the language which separate it
from the Dogon languages are the word order changes based on the tense, aspect, or mood of the
clause, and the tonal indexing of the subject on the verb and object if present.
As noted above, in some Dogon languages, nouns agree in number and animacy with
adjectives and demonstratives, and verbs agree with pronominal-subject categories. In Bangime,
there is no other form of agreement except that the plural clitic marks both an NP and the relative
complementizer.",[49]
"26611.6.2 Topicalization on Object
When a question is intended to differentiate objects instead of actions, as in (372), the response
in (372) is again the preferred answer, although not the default word order for an incompletive
sentence, that of the subject phrase-initially, followed by the aspect marker, which is in turn
followed by the verb.

11.6.3 Topicalization Changes in other Tenses
Examples of the verb ‘step on’ (374), a verb not marked inflectionally for tense or aspect,
illustrate the word-order variation for additional tenses. The default word order for an
incompletive clause with an object is SOV, as shown in (374) as SOV.
n dáà m póɣɔ̀
1.S INC T step on
I am stepping on.
n dáá kéndɛ̀ kéɛ̀ m póɣɔ̀
1.S INC slither thing T step on
I am stepping on a snake.
The object ‘a slithering thing’, meaning ‘snake’ precedes the verb as expected in an
incompletive clause.
The present tense is also shown to display variable word order in (376). The word order
of the sentence above may not be changed if the aspect is incompletive [*n dáá póɣɔ̀ kɛ́ndɛ̀ kɛ́è].","[285, 286]"

That is, both of the sentences describing the consequences of the phrase ‘I stepped on a

completive particle indicates the subject.

11.7 Summary of Word Order and TAM
The default or underlying word orders for each tense and aspect category which was shown to
undergo changes is shown in (386).
Word Order Variation
OSVINCSVOINC/CPL//PFV//PRF/SOV/INC/CPLPFVPRFThe completive aspects are by default verb final and the incompletive aspects are by
default object final. It appears that the concept of the action as relating to time of utterance is
secondary to the undergoer of the action since the object is closer to the subject when the action
is performed in the present and further away from the subject and the beginning of the sentence
if the action has already occurred.","[287, 288, 289]"

The subject of the sentence is tonally marked on the verb and noun. Aside from the lack
of auxiliaries, the sentence in (376) is not marked for tense or aspect in the expected manner.
The perfective aspect is normally formed with SVO word order. The perfective aspect is
distinguished from the completive by the addition of the completive particle following the object
noun but not by word order. However, as illustrated by (377), the default word order of the
perfective aspect is used, that of SVO.

The second clause in (378) is specifically marked by the particle and the high vowel
suffix on the VC4 stem as being perfect. The first clause is perfective. The perfect clitic could
also be seen as marking the entire phrase because the word orders are both SVO. An example of
three verbs being chained together without the use of the chaining particle is Chief 1.2.
The completive aspect default word order is SVO as in the phrases in (379) and (380);
however the object may precede the verb, as shown in (379).","[286, 287]"

refer to one who is writing a letter or a book.

Notice again that the object appears first, not the action, which would be expected if the

perfective aspect.

"260The completive, perfective, and perfect all have the same word order, but the perfect has
different inflectional marking for a VC1 verb. All verbs act the same for word order, but not for
inflectional suffixation patterns.
11.2.4 Irrealis Mood
When the verb is in its irrealis or chaining form, as with the verb ‘want’ in (354) or ‘go’ in (355),
the word order is S–V–V–O.

The object remains final in an infinitive and the verb is inflected with the root vowel

and the inflectional marking of the verb stem differs from the irrealis.

The incompletive aspects, all of which also employ the particle /daw/, follow the word order
SOV, except the future, which may have an OSV word order.

The number of the subject does not change the word order, and the allomorphy on the
incompletive particle is discussed in Chapter 9. Both sentences are in the default word order
found for the incompletive aspects, S-AUX-O-V. In some cases, such as in texts, with examples
found in Appendix I, Text II: Chief 3.4 - 5, it appears that the cause of the word order change is
one of topic. Topicalization can also be differentiated by asking a question.
11.6.1 Topicalization on Verb
The first question, in (367), was meant to focus on the task the subject is performing, reading or
writing. Four distinct answers are possible, given in the order listed below. The structure of

Western concepts of container and figure. Both [húⁿ] and [ko] may be translated as ‘to’ in (19a b) yet as ‘on’ and ‘with’ in (19c - d), respectively. Further, English ‘to’ is represented with the
postposition [waji] in (19e - f), but as ‘than’ in textual examples such as Chief 1.19. The
example (19c) is of further interest as the verb is clause final; the unmarked tense is normally
object final.
Although at the phrase level Bangime is head initial, with noun-postposition and nounmodifier word order (except DEF N and POSS N), at the clause level, the basic constituent order
depends is either SVO, SOV, or OSV. The ordering of constituents in the sentence depends on
the tense/aspect/mood of the clause. This is highly unusual, with surrounding languages of the
Mande and Dogon language groups all being strict SOV languages and languages of the Atlantic
group, such as Fulfude, being strictly SVO.
Person marking is optionally marked by pronouns, but is obligatorily indexed tonally on
the verb and object when present. As is further elaborated upon in Chapter 13, the first and third
singular person markers have three allomorphs, the morpheme [mi], a nasal, or tone on the verb
and/or object noun, if present.
The perfect aspect requires a non-second person nasal that precedes the perfect clitic,
labeled [~2], in addition to the pronominal subject. It is unclear why the subject is obligatorily
marked before the perfect clitic [kɛ́ɛ̀], unless the marker means ‘finish’ and the sentence is taken
to mean, ‘I drank cream; I finished it’. Second person is a short [a] and second person plural is a
long [aa], both precede the completive morpheme.
The tonal alternations represent tonal agreement for person. The object noun is part of
the tone alternations, which is interpreted to be a single tone contour for verb+object.","[50, 51]"
"A possessive pronoun is used instead of the genitive nasal to form stems in (178).

The person marker is a nasal (21a, c - d, f) for non-second persons and [a] for second
persons singular (21b) and plural (21e). The nasal or [a] also precedes the second stem of
reduplicated verbs. While a subject pronoun is obligatory, object pronouns may be omitted as
shown throughout Text I: Chief I.
A feature which is not shared by any surrounding language to my knowledge is the use of
tonal marking on the verb and object if present. Subject and TAM are marked by a combination
of segmental and autosegmental features. Shown in sentences (22) - (26), the aspects perfect and
perfective, and completive and incompletive, are marked by inflectional suffixation on the verb
(Chapter 8 - 9), particles (Chapter 10), and the placement of the object in the sentence (Chapter
11). The subject is marked by a nasal or [a], and tone on either the verb, object, or both.
The verb given in the examples /deɡ/ ‘hit’ is a transitive verb in verb Class One. The
perfective is an unmarked aspect in Bangime. The verb receives no inflectional marking other
than the root vowel, and there are no verb particles. The word order for the perfective is SVO.
Verbs in the perfective are not marked with the transitive morpheme, rather, as before the perfect
particle, the verb is preceded by a nasal for non-second persons and [a] for second persons
singular and plural. High tone marks the vowel of the verb stem in the first person and low tone
for third person. When an object is present, it surfaces with a polar tone, the opposite tone, to the
verb.",[53]
"The incompletive aspect can be viewed as being complementary to the completive aspect.
The incompletive /daw/ and completive /kamaa/ particles both follow the subject, and the verb
has the default, root vowel as the suffix. The differences lie in the word order and, consequently,
surface tone patterns. The verb precedes the object in an incompletive clause and the high tone
associated with the first person and low tone for third person continues to be marked on the verb.

"23910.2 Perfective Aspect
The simplest form of a sentence is tentatively glossed as the perfective aspect. The perfective is
expressed solely by the verb stem and the placement of constituents within the phrase, without
TAM auxiliaries.
n déɛ́
déɛ̀
.
1.S millet seed cultivate
I have cultivated.
The verb /de/ ‘cultivate’ is a VC2 stem (Chapter 8) and takes ‘millet seed’ as an
obligatory object (290). Certain verbs, such as /de/ ‘cultivate’, shown in Chapter 12, require a
cognate accusative i.e. a noun derived from the verb. The perfective word order is SVO.
Illustrated in Chapter 11, the word order of the sentence also changes based on the TAM of the
clause. The reason the gloss of the aspect is tentative is that examples from narratives comparing
the ‘perfective’ to the completive aspect such as Chief 7.2 and 4 make determining the exact
definition difficult. The same verb is used, with the same suffixation on the verb, and may be
even glossed the same. Thus, the term ‘perfective’ and ‘completive’ are used in this dissertation
with the matter of refining the definition left to further research.
10.3 Incompletive Particle /daw/
All incompletive clauses are marked with the particle /daw/. The placement of the particle
within the sentence helps to determine the tense or aspect of the phrase. The incompletive aspect
or incompletive particle has several allomorphs: [n da] ~ [na] [naw] ~ [na] and [daw] ~ [da].
The incompletive particle allomorphy is based on the subject of the sentence so that /na/
becomes [da] after the non-second person nasal as in examples, [n da noo] ‘I am coming’, [a na
noo] ‘you are coming’, but there are exceptions.","[258, 259]"

Eliciation of the verb ‘to sleep’ results in [dóɔ̀ ná ɲáẁ] ‘sleep is taken’. Note the changes
in word order between (404a, d) and (404b, c). The SVO word order corresponds with the
perfective aspect while the SOV order is found in the incompletive aspect clauses. The verb is
marked in each case as the perfective form segmentally since this is a VC3 stem which takes the
[–r] suffix in all incompletive aspects. The example (404d) illustrates the metaphorical use of
the verb to include a change to a solid state.
12.10 Summary of Cognate Accusatives and Reduplication
It has been shown in this chapter that verbs which take an obligatory object, a cognate
accusative, are often easily confused with those which are reduplicated verb stems. The
difference can be seen in the tenses in which the [r] suffix is inflected on the verb stem, or if a
direct object is specified in the verb phrase.","[295, 296]"
"261A sentence in the incompletive aspect utilizes the incompletive particle, the verb is
phrase-final, and the verb is inflected with the [–ɛ] suffix.
Compare the phrase in (357) with that in (355). Both use the verb [wore] ‘go’ to indicate
motion. The difference lies in the tense of the phrases and therefore the word order. The
sentence above in (325) is in the completive aspect with SVO order, while the one shown in
(357) is SOV; the ‘dummy’ verb [wore] is considered to be part of the auxiliary, so that the
structure is S-AUX-V-O-V.

"ConclusionBangime is a complex language with an unknown history. The language may have some
shared lexical items with surrounding Dogon languages, but shares little else in terms of
phonology, morphology, and syntax. Bangime has few productive suffixes on nouns. These
include the diminutive and the agentive. The plural is a clitic and the augmentative is a bound
morpheme. The underlying tone on nouns is seen before the plural or the augmentative marker.
The tonal system on nouns can be categorized into six classes or types. There is a tendency for
nouns with more than one syllable to necessitate a change in pitch somewhere in the word so that
monosyllabic nouns may surface with level tones but polysyllabic words may not. Syllable
structure is also restricted so that a minimal word consists of two morae, and a maximal word is
three, light syllables. Most bisyllabic words have either a heavy initial or heavy final syllable,
but not both. Potential vowel harmony processes are neutralized by the laxing of mid vowels
before approximant [r], velar [ɡ], and nasals. Diphthongs often occur in lieu of long vowels and
consist of vowels of different heights or even opposing [ATR] values.
Compounding is not a productive means of creating new lexical items in Bangime.
Instead, genitive constructions, [X's Y], are used in lieu of mono-morphemic lexical items, and
in many cases describe flora and fauna terms.
Adjectives follow the noun they describe. The plural marker is a clitic which then
follows the adjective. The tone of the noun does not influence the adjective, and the plural clitic,
which receives a polar tone, is opposite that of the adjective, not the noun stem. Quantifiers,
however, precede the plural clitic. The definite marker and the possessive pronouns precede the
noun. Both affect the tones on the noun stem and are affected by the noun stem as well. There is330a tendency in the language in general to express the first person tonally as a high tone and the
third person tonally as a low tone.
Verb stems are categorized into five main classes, based on the behavior of the verb root
in the various aspects and tenses in the language. Morphological marking on the verb stem
varies among the classes and includes a suffix [r] which is proposed to indicate efferentiality.
The only productive suffix on the verb is the causative suffix.
Tense, aspect, and mood is indicated in three ways in a clause: (1) the verb stem is
inflected based on its verb class, (2) the placement of the object (if present) varies within the
sentence - SOV for incompletive aspects, and SVO for completive ones, and (3) verb particles or
auxiliaries either precede or follow the verb stem or the object. Bangime also displays the rare
word order OSV in the future tense with an object; this should not be considered the passive
since it is the only way to express the future with an object and there is a separate morpheme and
process to create the passive mood. There is a contrast between the incompletive aspect and the
completive aspect for the markers /daw/ and /kama/ respectively. Further, a contrast exists
between the perfect clitic [kɛ́ɛ̀], for activity verbs and the stative suffix [wɛ], for stative verbs.
Another contrast takes place between a verb stem suffix vowel which is determined through
harmony patterns and a high vowel, although what the vowel signifies is yet to be determined.
The subject of a clause may be expressed through a noun, a pronoun, or tone. Even in the
presence of a subject marker, tone is marked on the verb stem, the particle, and/or the object
noun depending on the tense and the verb involved. There is a tendency again to express the first
persons with high tones, the third persons with low tones, and the second persons with low tones
as well, but the syllable shape of the verb, the object, and the tense of the sentence all affect the
outcome of the placement and the surface distribution of the tones.","[349, 350]"
"242The incompletive particle marks a phrase with ‘go’ as something which is ‘going to
happen’ in the future (300), while the completive aspect marker indicates that the event occurred
in the completive (301).
n dáẃ wórè n déɛ̀
.
I INC go
T cultivate
I am going to cultivate.
ŋ kó wórè déɛ̀
.
I CPL go
cultivate
I went to cultivate.
The default word order for a declarative incompletive sentence is S-AUX-O-V. A
definite direct object follows the incompletive particle, as shown in (302). An indefinite direct
object (303) or a pronominal object (302) may also precede the incompletive particle.

Thus, the incompletive aspect is formed with a segmental subject pronoun and/or tonal
marking on the verb and object, the particle /daw/ or its allomorphs, and the verb, which for most
verb classes does not have suffixation. Modifiers follow the object noun but precede the verb.","[261, 262]"
"The future is formed in one of two ways depending on whether or not the sentence has an
object. Even if the verb is transitive, if no object is specified (24a), the word order is subjectverb, followed by the secondary person marking (nasal or low vowel) and the incompletive
particle. If an object is included, the future tense is formed with the object first, followed by the
incompletive particle and the verb.

"When the word [daɣaɛ] modifies nouns such as ‘rope’ (229a) or ‘calabash’ (229b) it
functions as an adjective. However, when it modifies a verb (229c), it functions as an adverb,
although there is no segmental, or tonal change in the word.
7.10.4 Numerals
Numerals follow the noun they quantify. The numerals one to two thousand are listed in
Appendix VIII. Plural nouns which are quantified by numerals are not marked with the plural.

The clause is object-final, however, in any word order, the numeral and noun act as a
cohesive unit in the location within a sentence.
7.11 Adverb
Adverbs modify verbs and adjectives. An example adverb [jáár!ré] is shown modifying verbs
(232) and adjectives (233).",[216]
"23In some Dogon languages, nouns agree in number and animacy with adjectives and
demonstratives, and verbs agree with pronominal-subject categories. In Bangime, there is no
agreement for plural except in complementizer phrases. Also, tonal agreement for subject is
marked on a verb and an object where present. The plural in Bangime is a clitic [=nɛ] ~ [=ndɛ].
The homophonous marker [nɛ] is found as a singular in some Dogon languages, such as Yanda
Dom.
Another difference in the noun phrase is that the tone-lowering found on possessed
nouns, which is widespread among Dogon languages, is not found in Bangime. Although
complex tonal patterns are found in the possessive pronoun-possessed noun paradigms in
Bangime, tone lowering is not one of them. However, a tone-lowering process is triggered by
the definite article in Bangime.
Compounding is a productive means of creating new lexical items in Dogon. While
phrasal forms are common in lieu of one-stem lexical items, compounding as a process for
forming new lexical items is absent in Bangime.
Particularly in verbs, Dogon languages express inflectional and derivational morphology
through the use of multiple suffixes. Therefore, there is a significant difference morphologically
in the formation of verbs in Bangime and in the Dogon languages.
Forms for the word ‘I write’ in two Dogon languages are compared with Bangime in
(11). Shown in the examples, the negative imperfective and negative perfective aspect are
formed through a combination of suffixes in Dogon languages; in Bangime, the only difference
between the two sentences is the tone on the final vowel of the phrase. Note that the word for
‘write’ in each of the languages is similar, suggesting a borrowing if the whole Dogon word,
including the negative marker, is considered.","[42, 43]"
"24010.3.1 Incompletive Aspect
When the incompletive particle /daw/ precedes a verb, the clause is interpreted to be in the
incompletive aspect. In an incompletive clause, the subject is marked by a phrase-initial nasal
for non–second persons, and the transitive nasal marker precedes a transitive verb. The verb
agrees with the subject for person by tonal marking. The inflection on the verb differs for each
verb class; (291) is with a VC2 stem.
n dàá déɛ́
n dèɛ̀
.
1.S INC millet seed 1.S cultivate
I am cultivating.
n dáà n dèɛ́
.
1.S INC T cultivate
I cultivate.
The verb in (259) is not marked with the [–r] suffix, which, in VC2 stems, marks the
completive aspect. Therefore, the particle /daw/ indicates that the clause is in the incompletive
aspect, and the lack of [–r] suffix shows that the verb stem is also in the incompletive aspect.
The presence of the object before the verb indicates that this sentence is in the incompletive
aspect; the lack of it in (292) means that the sentence is in the completive aspect.
Some sentences in the incompletive aspect are ambiguous with respect to time. Temporal
adverbials may be used in order to specify when the event took place. For instance, ‘always’ or
‘every day’ modifies the phrase as being habitual (293).

the complementizer, to create nouns.
4.3.1Agentive with VerbsAfter a simple verb, the toneless agentive suffix surfaces with a low tone. Verbs in the agentive

"42whether the people have any genetic relation to the Dogon as they claim. In the meantime, the
description of Bangime set out in this dissertation provides the only description of the language
thus far, and may help eventually in solving a greater mystery of the origin of the Dogon
languages as well.
The Dogon language group had been misrepresented as one language (Bendor-Samuel,
Olsen, & White 1989), but current research estimates 18 to 20 separate Dogon languages and
over 60 dialects (Heath 2008; Hochstetler et al. 2004). This diversity and complexity is due to
the Dogon peoples’ geographic inaccessibility; they have until recently been confined to
secluded, sometimes concealed, villages within the rocky Bandiagara escarpment and various
isolated nearby mountains. Although Marcel Griaule, his team members Germaine Dieterlen and
Michel Leiris and his daughter, Geneviève Calame-Griaule, have published studies on a variety
of topics since the 1930s, including the Dogon languages, much of this work is widely criticized
by those who dispute Griaule’s methodology (van Beek 1991). Their generalizations about
Dogon language and culture based on one language do not apply to the rest of the Dogon area.
Even Leiris (n.d.) found Griaule’s badgering of speakers inappropriate and unproductive, leading
to incorrect data. Many of Griaule’s Dogon language consultants have now admitted to playing
games and misleading him. Publications on Dogon languages from Leiris and Calame–Griaule
continue to be criticized for top-down elicitation techniques.
The classification of languages is critical to tracing cultural history and lineage (Blench
2006). The Dogon languages lack certain features, such as a full noun class system, that are
common among languages of the Niger-Congo family, to which the Dogon languages have been
assigned, causing some historical linguists to doubt their common ancestry (Williamson &
Blench 2000). Further, the classification of the Dogon languages has fluctuated between the Gur43or “Voltaic” (Bertho 1953; Greenberg 1963) and Mande (Delafosse 1952) sub-branches, but
since significant links with either remain inconclusive, they are now not linked with any
subgroup (Gordon 2005), which makes determining their history difficult.
1.11 Organization
This dissertation provides a description of aspects of the morphophonology of Bangime. Since
this is the first published description of the language, the first chapter is dedicated to providing
an overview of all aspects of the language in comparison to surrounding languages, particularly
those in the Dogon group since it is among them that the language is spoken. The phonetic
inventory of the features found in the language is covered in 2.1. Chapter 3 illustrates noun
stems and their underlying segmental and autosegmental representations based on their behavior
with accompanying clitics. Nouns are divided into six segmental categories and six tonal
categories. Evidence is inconclusive at this time as to the link between the segmental and
autosegmental categories and there is at least one nominal suffix which has an undetermined
meaning. Known nominal clitics and suffixes are presented in Chapter 4, and pro-clitics follow
in Chapter 5. The tonal interactions between morphemes associated with the noun and nominal
stems are thoroughly discussed. Word-formation processes that go beyond the stem are shown
in 6.1. The main non-affixal word-formation process is the genitive construction. Compounding
is not a means available in the language, thus two nouns are connected with the genitive
morpheme, a nasal which takes the place of the initial consonant of the possessed noun. Genitive
constructions can act as stems semantically in that they may be modified or affixed in a manner
similar to stems. However, the phonology of the genitive construction acts as a phrase. Chapter
7 gives an overview of the modifiers found in the language. Adjectives must modify a noun; an
adjective does not surface in isolation. Quantifiers act in the same way, but a difference lies in a44plural NP as the plural clitic follows the entire NP in the case of an adjective, but follows the
noun and precedes a quantifier. There is only one negative marker, which may precede or follow
an NP. Because the same negative marker negates a verb phrase, it and its tonal effects are
presented in the final chapter, Chapter 14. An unusual attribute of the language is the fact that a
noun as an object in a verb phrase is tonally affected by the subject of the phrase. The person
marking is often not overtly marked but is marked tonally on the object noun. This is presented
in Chapter 13.
The second part of the dissertation covers the verb phrase. Because the tense, aspect, and
mood (TAM) system of the language is complex, it is broken up into three chapters. The verb
root is introduced first in Chapter 8. Verb roots are abstract representations of an underlying
form; a verb stem always emerges with tense, aspect, or mood and person tonal marking. Links
between form and meaning of proposed underlying verb roots illustrate that verbs may have even
more abstract underlying forms which indicate general senses, such as movement or types of
actions. Verb roots are grouped into five basic classes based on the ways the inflectional affixes
affect the verb phonologically and semantically. Chapter 9 presents the verb particles, which,
along with the inflectional categories presented in the previous chapter, specify the tense and
aspect of a sentence. In Chapter 11, the word order for each TAM category is presented. The
derivational categories of verbs are presented in Chapter 9. Some verbs may be reduplicated and
some must surface with an obligatory nominative accusative as an object. These verbs and the
manner in which they appear with other constituents in a sentence are shown in Chapter 12. The
tonal patterns on the verb phrase, the person marking on the verb and object nouns, are shown in
Chapter 14.","[61, 62, 63, 64]"
"24310.3.2 Future Tense
The future tense in a sentence without an object, shown in (305), is formed in with the same
constituents, in the same manner as the incompletive, except that the incompletive particle
follows the verb and invariably [naw]. A transitive verb is preceded by the transitive nasal. The
subject nasal may be differentiated from the transitive nasal when the subject is in the second
person, illustrated above.
n déɛ́
n náẃ .
T cultivate ~2 INC
I will cultivate.
When a sentence in the future tense has an object, the object may be inferred from the
sentence as shown in (306), or the object may surface clause-initially as shown in (307). The
incompletive marker then either follows the verb (306) - (308) or the object (309). Here, word
order is OSV.

When the particle /daa/ is used to mean ‘exist’ it always appears with the postposition
[wi] or [ko]. This expression is not marked for aspect or aspect, it can be used to indicate the
incompletive aspect as shown in the second sentence, the future tense, shown in the first
sentence, or the completive, shown in Chief 1.10.
10.4 Completive
The completive may be differentiated from the incompletive by the auxiliaries either preceding
or following the verb. The completive aspects include the completive aspect, the perfect aspect,
and the stative aspect. The completive aspect particle, like the incompletive aspect particle,
precedes the verb. The perfect and stative aspect morphemes follow the verb stem.
10.4.1 Completive aspect
The completive aspect is marked by the particle /kamaa/ with allomorphs [kaw̃aa] ~ [kɔo]. It
appears to be a grammaticalized form of the verb/adjective/noun meaning ‘become old’,‘older’,
and ‘ancestor’, [kaw̃aa] with root [kɔo] (verbal inflection is discussed above). The completive
aspect marker precedes a verb, which is preceded by the person agreement nasal.","[262, 263, 264]"
"26211.4 OSV
The future tense can be formed in two ways: O-S-V-AUX or O-AUX-S-V. The incompletive
particle /daw/ may follow the verb, shown in (360). The object precedes both the subject and the
verb. The other common way of expressing the future when the subject is not a pronoun is to use
a construction which is similar to the passive, shown in (361). The object is phrase-initial with
the verb at the end of the phrase. 51

There is no alternative construction to indicate that a sentence with an object will occur in
the future. The sentence in (361) is not considered to be in the passive mood since the passive
construction differs as shown in the following section.
11.5 Passive
The passive morpheme (362) - (363) is homophonous with the first and third person pronoun
[mi]. The subject is the first constituent in the sentence. The particle which indicates the
passive follows the verb.

"31914.5.2 Complex Nouns
Compounds are not a productive means of creating new lexical items in Bangime. Two potential
exceptions are shown in (480) to illustrate that the tones are not affected by the negative marker.
The word ‘child’ has a bound or lexicalized diminutive suffix in the singular citation form
[jaambɛ] but emerges as [jaa=ndɛ] in the plural and with [pʷiɛ]. The word [pʷiɛ] refers to a
‘wife’, but when following the root of ‘child’ the stem means ‘girl’. Similarly, when the word
[boro+mbɛ], plural [boro=ndɛ] ‘boy/boys’, follows the root of ‘child’, it means ‘young men’.

noun, with the exception of the dummy noun (481c - d), each noun has a high tone on the final
mora. It appears that the adjective blocks the tone lowering of the negative marker but that the
adjective itself is unaffected.
14.5.3 Summary of the Negative effects on the NP
The negative marker may precede or follow a noun in a NP. When it precedes a noun, it changes
the tone(s) of the noun. If an adjective follows a noun, the tone of the noun is affected. The next
section shows the tonal and segmental effects of the negative marker with a verb.
14.6 Negative Verb Phrase
The TAM categories are simplified in a negated clause. There are only two aspects when the
clause is marked as negative: incompletive and completive. The negative marker [bie] precedes
the verb just as it does a noun. The difference in the incompletive and completive aspects
depends on the verb’s inflectional class and the valency of the verb. Evidence from narratives
shows that the tones in negated clauses follow the opposite pattern as those described for positive
ones. Text XII, Tiga 2.14, 20, 26, shows that the tonal patterns shown for positive clauses is
reversed; the first person is associated with low tone on the verb and high tone on the object.
14.6.1 VC2 Stems
The present tense in both negative and positive clauses has SOV word order. The verb stem is
unsuffixed for inflection, and the verb stem is preceded by the transitive nasal.
In the completive aspect, just as with a positive clause, the word order is SVO. The verb
root is followed by the [–r] suffix. As discussed in Chapter 8, verbs in Class Two take the [–r]
suffix only in the completive aspect. Examples from texts, Chief 1.3, 4 show that when a clause
is in the present tense and the verb takes a direct object, the object directly precedes the verb.","[338, 339, 340]"

11.6 Topicalization

‘write’ without an object is shown in (364) to illustrate that the verb is transitive and is marked
by the transitive nasal preceding the verb. The verb [ɲɔɡɔndo] ‘write’ is an uninflected verb.

ASPECTS OF BANGIME MORPHOLOGY, PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOSYNTAX
This dissertation provides a description of aspects of the phonology, morphology, and
morphosyntax of Bangime. Bangime is a language isolate spoken in the Dogon language
speaking area of Central Eastern Mali. Although the Bangande, the speakers of Bangime, selfidentify with the Dogon, their language bears practically no resemblance to the surrounding
Dogon languages. Bangime has limited productive morphological processes whereas Dogon
languages are agglutinating, with productive morphemes to indicate inflectional and derivational
verbal and nominal processes.
Bangime has a complex tonal system. General tendencies of the tonal patterns are
described, with the many exceptions which frequently occur also outlined. Nominal tonal
melodies are apparent in plural forms. Objects in verb phrases receive tonal agreement with
tones on the verb in accordance with the subject of the sentence.
The tense, aspect, and mood system of the language is also complicated. Inflectional
marking on the verb, auxiliaries, and the word order all contribute to the indication of the tense,
aspect or mood of the sentence. An overview of these multifaceted phonological and
morphological processes is provided in this dissertation with hypotheses as to how the language
might have evolved.

The Human Subjects approval number is #08–13242. All the data included in this study were
recorded using a Marantz PMD660 Professional Portable Digital Recorder with a Shure SM48S–
LC Microphone and were analyzed using the program Praat. Microsoft Excel was used for
plotting vowel formant values and storing lexical items. SIL Fieldworks was used to analyze
texts. Transcriptions are either /phonemic/ or [phonetic] and are written in IPA format. Lexical
items are listed in citation form unless otherwise noted. Long vowels are represented by the
notation {vv}, with tone marked on both vowels of the sequence. Tones are marked with an
acute accent for high {ˊ}, a grave accent for low { ̀}, and a combination for rising { ̌ }.
Morpheme boundaries are indicated with a dash { – } in between morphemes for suffixes and a
equals sign { = } for clitics. The terms root and stem are defined by Aronoff (1994). A
superscript {ⁿ} following a target vowel or approximant is used to represent nasality. When
available, two examples are shown, otherwise the sole example found is shown. TAM markers
are abbreviated and translated. Postpositions have varying meanings which do not translate
directly so PP is used in lieu of a gloss. Hyperlinks are underlined and written in blue
throughout the dissertation which lead to the section mentioned.","[6, 7, 8, 9]"
"The perfect aspect is differentiated from the perfective by the addition of the perfect clitic
[kɛ́ɛ̀], and the high vowel suffix on the verb. The word order is not changed, and neither are the
tones. The transitive nasal precedes the verb in the perfect aspect, but the secondary person
marking precedes the perfect clitic.
Perfect
a.",[54]
"Cognate Accusatives and Reduplication12.1 Cognate Nominals as Obligatory Objects
Some verbs appear to be a reduplicated form of the stem. However, most seemingly
reduplicated verbs in Bangime are actually a combination of a verb stem and a phonologically
related nominal. This is particularly evident in the generic present tense. In a declarative
statement in the generic present tense with a non-second person subject, the only difference
between the verb stem and an indefinite noun stem is the tone. In the generic present tense, the
word order is SVO.
12.2 Perfective
The verb /dé/ ‘cultivate’ emerges as [déɛ̀] in the perfective aspect. The noun ‘millet seed’ is also
[déɛ̀] ~ [déɛ́+mɛ̀]. I hypothesize that these words are derived from the same root since millet is
the primary cultivated crop. Therefore, the sentence ‘I cultivate’ is the same as ‘I cultivate millet
seed’; speakers do not perceive a difference between the two statements as shown in (387).

Compare the phrases in (375a) and (375b). Segmentally, the verb and noun in (375a) are
the same. Tonally, the verb is marked with a high tone for the first person and the object noun
with a low tone in the manner described in detail in Chapter 13. The phrase in (375b) shows that271the object noun is in the same place as the proposed object in (375a). This illustrates that the
verb and noun are separate words, not a reduplicated stem.
Other verb and cognate noun combinations differ by vowel quality, as shown by (388).

In the perfective aspect, the verb appears almost identical to the noun, making the
distinction difficult to determine.
12.3 Completive aspect
The difference between the noun and the verb stem is most clearly seen when the verb stem is
inflected for tense, such as in the completive aspect, and is contrasted with a verb stem which is
clearly marked for the completive aspect.

In addition to the verb being affixed with the [–r] suffix, the definite marker may
intervene to mark the noun, clearly illustrating that the verb and object noun are separate stems
and not part of a reduplicated verb stem.
Further examples of verbs which are marked with the [–r] suffix illustrate the differences
between the verb and the cognate noun in the sentences (390) - (392).","[290, 291]"

I do not writeI did not writeComparison of the forms for the word ‘write’ in Jamsay and Tiranige, two Dogon
languages, with the form in Bangime (11), show that although the verbs are similar, the
morphology differs. The examples from Jamsay are representative of typical Dogon
morphology. Although negation and aspect are expressed through a portmanteau morpheme in
the Jamsay verb, the stem is composed of three discernible morphemes, two of which are
suffixes. In the sentence from Bangime, there are three separate morphemes, none of which has
affixal properties.Also, the order of the constituents in the Dogon verb stem, person, tense, and
negation, is to follow the verb root, whereas person and negation precede the verb stem in
Bangime. 20 Tone in Dogon is a property of the verb root; although the lexical tone can be
overridden by inflectionally or derivationally-controlled tone overlays. In Bangime, tone is an
inflectional morpheme which interacts with the tone of the verb stem to indicate aspect.","[43, 44]"

The word order of a sentence varies based on the tense of the clause. However, the
placement of the object in the sentence does not seem to be the contributing factor to explain the
tonal differences. Rather, the tense of the sentence, the syllable shape of the verb stem, and the
syllable shape of the object noun all seem to play a part in influencing the tonal behavior.","[332, 333]"
"48
The aspect which is glossed as being ‘perfective’ has been difficult to elicit and to translate accurately. Also, the
verbs were given with both the high [u] and the mid [ɛ] vowel as acceptable in the perfective aspect. The tense
‘completive’ is mostly used in texts and is glossed here tentatively as such. Verbs may also vary in this tense/aspect
for word order and inflectional marking without apparent changes in meaning. Both of these aspects will be
examined in detail in future research.",[220]
"278Shown in this chapter, the tonal patterns for person and number vary and are marked on
the verb stem, the auxiliary, the object noun, or in some cases, all of the above. Although the
determining factor causing the variation is not yet known, it appears to be dependent on the
phonotactics and underlying tones of the verb stem. First, a verb is shown in the perfective
aspect with a noun whose tones do not alternate to concentrate on the patterns of the verb stem.
13.2 Perfective
In the perfective aspect, the clausal structure is relatively simple. A clause consists of a subject
or a pronoun, verb, and an object noun, in that order. The perfective aspect is not marked with
any auxiliaries or verb particles. The tones on the verb differ depending on the number and
person of the subject. Tonally, the first person is a high tone and the third person is a low tone
on the verb. However, similar to the possessive pronoun paradigms, the surface realization of
the tone on the stem depends on a variety of factors. An indefinite noun appears in each
sentence in (406) with a high-low tonal melody, which differs from the noun’s singular low-high
melody [ŋàmbá].

1.8.4Greeting SequencesA curiosity in Bangime are the greeting sequences shown in (28), or rather, lack thereof. Most,
if not all, African languages are known for their lengthy call and response greeting sequences.
Bangime has the normal question-type of greetings, but there are few responses which are not
borrowings from Arabic, and many are simply intonational prolongations of the greeting itself.

are curious. Note that, in addition to the relative simplicity of these greetings, there is no
introductory [pòó] or final [tàárè] common to every Dogon language. The one similarity
between the Bangime greeting sequence and those of Dogon languages is the afternoon
introductory greeting [tija], which is also used in the neighboring Dogon language Tiranige.
Thus, the key grammatical aspects of Bangime which separate it from other languages in
the area in which it is spoken in Central-Eastern Mali are (1) disharmonic sequences for the
feature [ATR] tautosyllabically and tautomorphemically, (2) lack of bound morphology, (3)
person agreement marking on objects in the verb phrase, and (4) word order specified by tense.
Among the core vocabulary items, some lexical items bear strong resemblances with Dogon
languages, and consistent sound changes are found between Bangime and potentially related
Dogon words. The Dogon languages themselves vary extensively and lexical correspondences
between Bangime and the Dogon languages are found in a geographically widely distributed
area. Although Bangime is not a Dogon language, I hypothesize that the language had a
connection to, or borrowed from, the Dogon languages at a time when the Dogon languages were
more cohesive. Suggestions as to why the Bangime speakers drew so heavily upon the
vocabulary of Dogon and not the grammar are outlined in the following subsections.
1.9Bangime: ‘a secret language’During the last few months of my second to last fieldwork trip, it became clear that elicited
lexical items were not the same as those used in natural conversation. The elicited items were
often loanwords. These contrast with the periphrastic expressions used in speech. For example,
the word given for ‘fence’ [sáàⁿ], suggests a loan word from Bamana [saaⁿ], but in every day
usage, the phrase [bùrá̃ míndé ɥùrúɡí dóò à ɡòmè màá kɛ́rɛ́], translated as, ‘stick(s) put into the38ground so that people may pass next to the rice’, is employed to describe, in this instance, a fence
surrounding the rice fields. In fact, ‘sáàⁿ’ is unacceptable for any type of fencing if one is
speaking the “true” language. Further examples of so-called “deep Bangime” are shown in (29).

"ɡûɥthrowN/HLHLg.pǔɡwashN/HLLHh.jéndōcallHMHHAs summarized by the table in (429) bisyllabic stems display more variation than
monosyllabic verb stems tonally. While all the verbs have at least one high tone in the first
person, not all have at least one low tone in the third person, as would be predicted by the
generalizations shown thus far.
13.4 Verb Phrase with an Object
A direct object follows the verb in a perfective phrase. The verb tones continue to follow the
same pattern as described for clauses without objects; a phrase with the first person singular as
the subject receives a high tone on the verb and a phrase with the third person singular as the
subject surfaces with at least one low tone on the verb stem. A direct object is marked with a
polar tone to that of the verb, irrelevant of the noun’s tonal class. A direct object is marked with
a low tone in a phrase where the first person singular person is the subject and with a high tone
when the third person singular is the subject.",[309]

10.8 Summary of Verb Particles and TAM
Recall from the previous chapter that the inflectional patterns differ depending on the class of
verb and that the class of verb may be a composition of the derivational properties of the stem.
Now that the verb particles have been presented, the next chapter gives an overview of the how
the categories of tense, aspect, and mood fit into the word order patterns.","[275, 276]"
"25210.5 Mood
The irrealis, imperative, subjunctive, and prohibitional moods are found in Bangime and are each
marked by particles shown in this section.
10.5.1 Irrealis
The irrealis is marked by the particle [ha] and is used with a verb stem in clauses such as ‘I wish
to do X’ or ‘in order to’ as in (328) - (329). Conditional phrases may also use the irrealis marker
in the second clause (330). The hortative (331) may also be marked with the particle [ha].

10.6 Copula
A particle which has arisen in texts but is difficult to elicit seems to act as a copula in some verb
clauses, such as those listed in (334). The copula /maa/ can be used in a manner similar to ‘be’
in English. In the cases elicited, the copula serves as the perfective aspect. However, it has
occurred in texts in other tenses as well. The copula [maa] is used with humans.

"Negation14.1 Overview of the Negative Marker
The negative morpheme [bíè] is the only means to negate a sentence. The negative marker may
precede a noun, acting as a negative copula. The negative marker may also follow a noun to
indicate lack of something. Verbs are also negated by the same marker preceding the verb. The
tonal effects of the negative marker and its placement in a sentence are discussed in this chapter.
14.2 Word Order in a Negated Clause
The negative marker usually precedes each constituent it negates.

"321The word order of a negated present tense clause is S-AUX-O-V, just as with the positive
incompletive marker /daw/.
In both tenses, the tone of the verb stem after the negative marker is in most cases low,
although there are exceptions. First person singular examples are shown in (482).

reduplicate and take the [–r] suffix.
14.6.2 Timing in the Negative VC2 Stem
The negative verb phrase differs from the positive verb phrase in the behavior of the transitive
nasal. The completive lacks the nasal, and it employs the [–r] suffix on the verb; the present
surfaces with the nasal, but the verb does not have the suffix. The difference between the present
and completive aspects in the negative is one of timing. Each verb phrase contains the exact
same number of syllables and morae, as illustrated in (484).

"32514.6.3 Intransitive Stems with the [–r] Suffix
Among verbs that are suffixed with the [–r] morpheme, few are intransitive, with examples listed
in (486). Intransitive verbs cannot compensate for the loss of the mora in the incompletive
negative stem, as there is no transitive morpheme.

number of morae in the corresponding present and completive sentences must contain equal
numbers. Since the transitive morpheme, a homorganic nasal, must precede the verb in the
present tense forms to follow the correct word order, this takes the place of one mora and thus,
the present tense verb stem deletes a syllable to compensate. Further, the data illustrate that even
if the clause contains an object, the nasal marker remains, showing that it is a true marker of
transitivity and not a pronominal form. The data show that intransitive verb sentences do not
follow the same mora-timing pattern, but the syllables are still of the same number.
14.7 Transitive Verbs
Verbs which do not take the [–r] suffix also do not compensate for the lack of the nasal in the
negative completive aspect stem. In addition to the presence or absence of the transitive nasal,326transitive verbs without the [–r] suffix show a tonal difference. Based on the above conclusion
that the language is mora-timed, the tonal assignment is likely to have a correlation based on the
mora timing as well but this needs further investigation. The verbs in (487) show a pattern of a
high tone on the final mora of the Incompletive stem and a low on the final mora of the
completive aspect stem.

being pulled. Alternatively, this could also be due to word order fluctuation. Further, note that if
there was a genitive nasal between the constituents, it would be omitted because of the adjective
which follows the noun.","[188, 189]"
"1646.10 Genitive with Postposition
Although postpositions typically do not co-occur with the genitive, one postposition, [ŋ kò],
glossed as ‘inside’, is always preceded by it. I analyze this as the root of ‘stomach’ [kò+ríɛ́],
preceded by the genitive marker, as the use of ‘stomach’ to refer to ‘inside’ is an areal feature for
West African languages and it is is shown in its full form in certain narratives (Tiga 1.150).

Other postpositions (and the completive particle) are preceded by a secondary personal

As shown in §5.9.4, certain flora terms are obligatorily denoted as being definite.

Recall that the definite marker often lowers (at least) the initial tones of the noun it
precedes, especially when it is obligatory. In (173) we see that the tone-lowering only spreads to
the penultimate syllable of the initial noun of the genitive phrase.
Multiple phrases are shown in (174) with ‘tree’ and ‘head’ plus the adjective ‘white’ in
order to illustrate the loss of the genitive marker with adjective phrases, and the fact that the
definite marker does not induce the loss of any segment in the phrase. The phrases (174a - c) are
simple phrases while the phrase (174d) is the name of an herb species with a white flower.","[183, 184]"
"19intermediate fricative allophone [β], (instrumental phonetic study is needed on this point), and
the voiced velar stop /ɡ/ alternates with the voiced velar fricative [ɣ] intervocalically. This latter
alternation is found among Dogon languages, although the former, /b/ ~ [ʋ], is not.
As shown in the phonemic inventory comparison, nasalization appears on approximants
among the Dogon languages as well as in Bangime. In Bangime, a nasal stop cluster becomes a
nasalized approximant via an aspectual change in verbs. The closest Dogon counterparts,
according to Heath (p.c.), are cases of syncope of CVrV
̃ – to CVn– before a consonantal suffix,
and, (in Toro Tegu only), of CVw̃V to CVm– in the same environment. These can be taken as
consonant-cluster adjustment processes and do not have the more abstract transformational
character of the Bangime alternations.
The syllable structure of Bangime is different than that found in Dogon. Codas are
permissible in Dogon but appear as co-articulation or as secondary features on vowels in
Bangime. Bangime has a set of labialized and palatalized consonants word-initially. Labialized
and palatalized word-initial consonants (CʷV and CjV) may occur in free variation with syllabic
CuwV and CijV sequences, respectively, as they do in some Dogon languages (e.g. Tomo Kan).
Nasals represent another area of differentiation. Nasals are typically homorganic with the
following consonant. The many instances of homorganic nasal segments found in Bangime arise
from phonologically occurring geminate segments, the genitive morpheme, the transitive marker
for verbs, and person marking for non-second person subject and object.
As shown in (7), bisyllabic words which begin with a nasal are preceded by a nasal. This
nasal is homorganic for alveolar and bilabial nasals, and alveolar for palatal and velar nasals.
Word-internally, geminate nasals are either alveolar or bilabial.","[38, 39]"
"250A change-of-state verb is also marked with the stative suffix when describing the
condition of a person. Shown in (323), in order to describe a person as being dead, the
complementizer is used, followed by the verb ‘dead’ and the stative suffix.
