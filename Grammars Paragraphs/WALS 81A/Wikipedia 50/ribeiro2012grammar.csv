"125Vowel harmony is among the most remarkable characteristics of Karajá phonology.
Common in African languages, [ATR] vowel harmony is exceedingly rare outside of Africa;
Karajá presents the first documented case of this type of vowel harmony in South America.
Since most languages presenting [ATR] vowel harmony are genetically or areally related, the
Karajá case provides a different perspective for the typological understanding of the
phenomenon (Ribeiro 2002). Once again, the chapter does not provide the final word on the
subject, indicating instead additional topics for investigation; for instance, a thorough
accoustic analysis of the vowel inventory is yet to be conducted, in order to investigate
whether the mechanisms underlying [ATR] distinctions in Karajá are similar to those found
in better-known languages.","[136, 137]"

Northern Karajá, and Xambioá. In Javaé, on the other hand, 1st person centrifugal forms completely parallel the
centripetal form, as it can be seen in the examples below. In this sense, the Javaé dialect presents a more
regular paradigm. Javaé may reflect more closely what may have existed in Proto-Karajá, or such regularity
may be an innovation by analogy.

the other hand, can be identified by their position and by the circumstance that, when
pronominal, they are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29). However, when both
subject and object are nouns, they can only be distinguished by the word order, canonically
SOV:(33)8.3.1a.","[51, 52]"
"5. Descriptive wordsA number of Macro-Jê languages—including Karajá--are traditionally described as
presenting an active-stative verb agreement system to some degree. According to Fortune &
Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs are divided into two different classes, active
and stative, with the latter consisting essentially of predicates which denote adjectival
meanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ These predicates take a series of person markers
which partially coincides with the pronominal object markers in transitive verbs, and which
happens to be the same series of possessive prefixes occurring with nouns. A more careful
examination, however, demonstrates that such ‘verbs’ are, in fact, nouns, and that transitivity,
rather than stativity, plays a central role in Karajá grammar.
The case of Karajá (as well as a brief observation of other languages of the stock)
suggests that one must be cautious in analyzing descriptive predicates as verbs in Macro-Jê212languages. In cases in which there are clear criteria to distinguish nouns and verbs,
descriptive predicates tend to behave mostly like nouns. For example, in Karajá a verb must
first be nominalized in order to appear in a descriptive predicate. Consequently, one must
also be cautious in relying on the behavior of descriptive predicates as a sole criterion to
propose active-stative systems.
Predicative and attributive adjectives are among the lesser known aspects of Macro-Jê
languages. According to the descriptions available, in all Macro-Jê languages the ‘adjective’
would follow the noun (Rodrigues 1999: 193). Since most Macro-Jê languages are SOV, the
position of the adjective in these languages would constitute a systematic counter-example to
Greenberg’s implicational universals, according to which adjectives would tend to precede
the modified noun in SOV languages (Greenberg 1966). However, since most such
descriptions do not give clear evidence for the existence of adjectives as an independent part
of speech, the apparently exceptional nature of adjectives in Macro-Jê may well be just
another undesirable result of what one might call ‘translation-based linguistic analysis.’
That is certainly the case of Karajá, also traditionally described as having postposed
adjectives (Maia 1998: 32). However, a careful analysis of the Karajá data clearly
demonstrates that words denoting adjectival meanings in this language are abstract nouns
whose behavior is identical to that of obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding to
attributive constructions such as the angry man, Karajá presents a genitive construction, the
man’s anger. This implies that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” word
would be, in fact, the head of the noun phrase, a phenomenon documented in languages such
as Aleut (Sadock 2000), but commonly overlooked when considering Lowland South
American languages.","[223, 224]"
"45Relative case marks a syntactically dependent form; absolutive case marks an independent form.
2206. Final remarksThis chapter described the morphology of Karajá, focusing especially on the
inflectional and derivational properties of nouns and verbs. A thorough description of verb
and noun morphology makes it possible to determine the morphosyntactic position of
‘descriptives’, i.e. lexemes that denote adjectival meanings. Contrary to previous analyses
(Fortune 1973, Maia 1986), the description provided here demonstrates that descriptives are
in fact nouns. A conclusive proof of their nominal nature is the fact that, in order to be used
as a descriptive word, a verb must be first nominalized, which is particularly clear in cases
for which nominalization is indicated by consonantal replacement.","[231, 232]"

The domain of vowel harmony seems to be the phonological word, characterized by a
single primary stress. Although stress seems to be useful in determining the domain of vowel
harmony, it is irrelevant in characterizing triggers, since, as we have seen, vowel harmony113can be triggered not only by stems and derivational suffixes (which are intrinsically tonic),
but by clitics (which are intrinsically unstressed) as well.
Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with the
verb, vowel harmony can take place between the verb and the object. Considerations of
frequency seems to play a role in predicting whether vowel harmony will take place. That
seems to be especially common with idiomatic and formulaic constructions (such as curses).
A case in point is the noun b´dE ‘time, ground, world’, which occurs in a number of
idiomatic expressions as an ‘empty’ object (b´dE + rÈrÈ ‘remember’ > ‘to become sad’; b´dE
+ buka ‘disagree; not fit’ > ‘to be unlucky, when fishing, hunting, etc.’; b´dE + kErÈ ‘to
know’ > ‘to realize’). This word also occurs in non-idiomatic constructions, as the subject of
‘atmospheric’ verbs (‘to cool down’, ‘to become silent’, ‘to become dark’, etc.) or as an
object. In its more idiomatic uses, b´dE can cliticize to the verb or even be incorporated into
it; as the examples below demonstrate, vowel harmony triggered by the first vowel in the
verb root buka extends all the way to the object b´dE (78). Vowel harmony between the verb
and its object is further illustrated by (79), a curse, where the clitic èr-e ‘imperfective’
triggers vowel harmony throughout the verb, reaching the object ruE ‘eye’.","[124, 125]"
"8.2.1 Syllable and bimoraic-minimality constraintThe canonical syllabic pattern in the language is (C)V. However, in Southern and
Northern Karajá, surface CCV syllables can appear as the result of the deletion of a schwa
8Although the occurrence of the low-frequency vowel /¸)/ with a)h¸) could in principle be attributed to the likely
onomatopoeic origin of the word, the same obviously cannot be said of its other attestations.

The minimal phonological word in Karajá must be bimoraic. In order to satisfy such
constraint, an underlyingly monosyllabic root must, when pronounced by itself, duplicate its
vowel: bE ‘water’ [bE""E], wa ‘pé’ [wa""a], tSu ‘sun’ [tSu""u]. CCV-words behave, as one would
expect, as bimoraic. As we will see (Chapter 2), CCV syllables also behave phonologically
as bimoraic units in processes such as reduplication and hypocoristic shortening.","[40, 41]"
"AntipassiveAntipassive is a phenomenon typical of ergative languages, corresponding
functionally to a ‘mirror image’ of the passive construction in nominative-accusative
languages (Silverstein 1976). In a syntactically ergative language, “while the A and the O in
an ergative clause are marked as ergative and absolutive respectively, the A in an antipassive
is typically coded as an absolutive NP, and the O (if present) appears in a case other than the
absolutive” (Cooreman 1994, 50).39 Although some authors, such as Cooreman, limit the
discussion of antipassive constructions to ergative languages, nominative-accusative
39I will follow Cooreman in adopting Dixon’s (1979) use of the labels A and O to refer to the two participants in
a two-participant clause—prototypically, the agent and the patient, respectively.
195languages may also present backgrounding antipassives, which “function to demote the
undergoer to peripheral status” (Foley and Van Valin 1985: 338). This is what occurs in
Karajá, where antipassive, marked by the prefix O-, results in the deletion of an unknown or
irrelevant direct object:(33)nadIrOTUhOrErI

‘The man is splitting (something).’As these examples show, antipassive in Karajá is not promotional (or foregrounding),
in the sense that the A remains in the same syntactic relation it occupies in the corresponding
active, transitive voice. Furthermore, the antipassive construction in Karajá does not allow
the expression of the demoted O whatsoever, which is an interesting parallel to what occurs
with the agent in the passive construction.
Antipassives in Karajá are used to suppress an irrelevant, unknown, or undetermined
object. Common examples involve typical activities such as ‘to clear (a garden)’:(35)idZoi wobaèdI∅-r-O-laSiurEèkre
guys ax=INSTR
3-CTFG-ANTI-clear=FUT
‘The guys will clear [the garden] with axes.’
At least one intransitive stem, -ObrO, seems to have resulted from reanalysis of aformerly transitive stem including the antipassive marker, as suggested by the existence of an
allomorph without the initial vowel (brO; cf. also the nominal form, a-l-ObrO-da ‘plant’). As196the example below shows, -ObrO ‘to plant’ is an intransitive, intrinsically antipassive verb,
which needs to be transitivized in order for it to occur with objects:40(36)warikOrEwadEkErIkOrOm´)Îawa-rikOrE

Although the antipassive was not described by previous authors, it is commonly
found in both narrative and descriptive texts, commonly being used in contexts such as the
one above, in which an antipassive form of the verb is later followed by a transitive one,
specifying the object. Another example, from a traditional tale, is provided below. The
sentences are part of a passage in which two young men, returning to their village, hear
someone pounding something with a mortar. At first, the verb TÈ is given in an antipassive
form, later followed by a transitive one:(37)id´)

of direct object prefixes coincides partially with the series occuring with nouns and
descriptive predicates. Pronominal subjects of transitive and intransitive predicates are
expressed by free pronouns (dIkar´) ‘I’, kai ‘you’, Î´kI ‘he, she, it’).","[206, 207, 208, 209]"

‘The birds scattered.’2.6.3 Verbalization of noun-noun compoundsA number of verbs present compound stems which superficially resemble noun
incorporation constructions, but which are actually the result of the verbalization of nounnoun compounds. In some cases, the second element in the noun-noun compound is a
deverbal noun, creating constructions which may look, at first sight, as the result of valencechanging noun incorporation, as in the example below:(46)♂a.biuèkI

3-CTFG-INTR-jatobá-eat-VERB=CONV∅-r-∅-Ud´)èb´)h´)
3-CTFG-INTR-sit=HABIT
‘He sat at the top eating jatobá fruit.’
That ÎO ‘to eat (sweets), suck’ in (46) is in its nominal form (derived by zeroaffixation or conversion) is shown by the fact that it requires the verbalizing suffix -d´). That
is particularly clear when the deverbal noun is derived by consonantal replacement, as in (47)
below, where rÈ is the nominal form of the verb kÈ ‘to eat (grains, bread, etc.)’:(47)♂a-r-a-bolo-r
bolo-rÈÈ-d´)èkre
a-CTFG-INTR-cake-eat-VERB=FUT
‘I will do some cake-eating.’2.6.4 Derivation as incorporation: causative -d
-d´´k´)203All the incorporation constructions described above fit well into the traditional,
Sapirian definition of noun incorporation, since they involve independent noun and verb
stems which can also occur in non-incorporating constructions. I suggest, however, that
Karajá also has a less usual type of incorporation, similar to what has been described by
Sadock for West Greenlandic (Sadock 1980), involving the causativizer -d´k´). As we have
seen, -d´k´) selects only nominal stems, in such a way that, in order to be causativized, a verb
root must first be nominalized. I suggest that -d´k´), although morphologically dependent, is
a noun-incorporating stem.
Such an analysis is particularly appealing if one takes into consideration extended
intransitive verbs, which, as we have seen, take non-canonically marked objects. That is the
case of the verb -ehu ‘to throw’, whose objects are marked with the instrumental postpositionèdI (48a). While, with transitive verbs, the original object cannot be expressed under
causativization, with extended intransitive verbs the original object is preserved with its
original marking, and the original subject (the causée) is expressed as a direct object (48b):(48)a.kUladU m´nadIrehurebOdOIdIkUladU b´)da)èdI

The man made the child throw the rock with a sling.’204The main argument for treating causativization as a case of noun incorporation à la
Sadock (i.e., a case of syntactic word-formation) is the fact that the original verb root seems
to preserve some syntactic saliency, still assigning case to its original, non-canonically
marked object.","[213, 214, 215, 216]"
"2. The minimal wordThe minimal phonological word in Karajá must contain at least two moras. In order
to obey this constraint, underlying monomoraic stems must duplicate their vowel (1a), when
occuring by themselves in a phrase, or they may cliticize to a following word in the same
phrase (1b, 1c). This is illustrated below by the noun stem bE ‘water’ (1) and by the pronounÎU ‘3.LOC’ (2):(1)a.[kUla""dU

Although some (Î-class) roots are constituted of a single vowel (u ‘tooth’, O ‘cluster,bunch; stem’), no root is constituted by a consonant alone. With the exception of the
causative suffix -d´k´) (♂ d´)´)), affixes (some of which are constituted of a consonant alone;
e.g. r- ‘centrifugal direction’, d- ‘centripetal direction’, Î- ‘3rd person’) are all monosyllabic.
Verb and noun stems can be monosyllabic or polysyllabic. Most postpositions are
monosyllabic, but a few are disyllabic (èw´da) ‘comitative’, èr´bI ‘ablative’, èw´TE
‘comparative’, èd´kE ‘dative’, èlaku ‘evitative’).","[85, 86]"

When an oblique domain noun is separated from the relative clause, notice that the
postposition marking the oblique NP occurs twice—with both the domain noun and the
subordinate clause. That is, the stranded relative clause agrees in case with the domain noun:(33)iwErUèb´)

nouns. In this section, attention will be given to the relativized position—that is, the position
in the relative clause which is co-referential with the domain noun. In all the examples of
relative clauses presented so far, the relativized position corresponds to a core argument of
the subordinate clause—either the subject, as in (32), or the direct object, as in (33). As these
examples show, there is no surface indication of which position is relativized, which is
indicated by gapping—that is, the relativized NP is simply absent from the relative clause.
This lack of explicit indication of which position is relativized may lead to ambiguity when
one has a third-person transitive verb with a third-person object. Thus, in both examples
below, the relativized position may be interpreted as being either the subject or the direct
object of the subordinate clause:(34)♂ha)wÈÈèb´)

‘The woman who hit the man is arriving’
or ‘the man who hit the woman is arriving.’235Subject and direct objects are the positions which tend to be more easily relativizable
cross-linguistically, when compared with other syntactic positions. The hierarchy of which
positions are more likely to allow relativization is thus summarized by Keenan and Comrie
(1977):(36)Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility Hierarchy:Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Object of Adposition > Possessor
While subject and direct object relativized positions are not marked in Karajá,
relativized positions occupying a lower position in the accessibility hierarchy are marked by
a third-person pronominal form. That is, relativization of any syntactic position besides
subject and direct object is accomplished through pronoun retaining strategies. This is the
case for objects of all the postpositions (including the dative, which behaves as any other
oblique NP in the language, and objects of comparison), as well as possessors. Below are
examples of relativized locative (37), ablative (38), and genitive (39) positions:(37)kai

The example below further illustrates a pronoun-retaining relative clause, involving
the object of the verb -ehu ‘to throw, to shoot’, which is marked with the instrumental
posposition èdI. Notice that the clitic èle ‘only’, which generally attaches to the right edge
of a noun phrase, occurs after the subordinate verb:(40)biuraèO

device—which we may call ‘subordinating accent’—is reminiscent of the ‘definite accent’ in
Tonga, described by Anderson (1992: 212) as an example of non-affixal clitic. In this
language, according to Anderson, “the normal location of stress is on (the syllable
containing) the penultimate mora. A sort of definiteness is marked by a stress shift to the
final mora of the entire NP.” In this case, the stress shift is explained as being the reflex of a
demonstrative morpheme *a which would have existed diachronically.","[245, 246, 247, 248]"

This chapter describes Karajá’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition to
morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Most of the chapter will be devoted to verb morphology, which is where most of
Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb inflects for person (with portmanteau
morphemes which also indicate mood), direction (which also play evidential functions), and
voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive), besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns
(sometimes with classificatory purposes). Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and
particles, respectively. As in many other lowland South American languages, nouns,
postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share person-marking paradigms. Since
postpositions have already been described in Chapter 1, and their semantic and syntactic
characteristics will be further discussed in Chapter 5, they will not be dealt with in this
chapter. Section 2 describes the inflectional properties of verbs. Section 3 deals with the
inflectional properties of nouns and briefly discusses the small class of personal pronouns,
outlining their main differences in relation to nouns. Section 4 discusses derivational
morphology, describing processes used to create new noun (Section 4.1) and verb (4.2)
stems.
Karajá, like most (if not all) Macro-Jê languages, lacks adjectives as an independent
part of speech. In languages lacking adjectives, their functions tend to be expressed by nouns
or verbs. The tendency, in Macro-Jê studies, has been to describe ‘descriptives’ (i.e., words
expressing adjectival functions) as verbs, an interpretation which has also been proposed for172Karajá (Fortune 1973, Maia 1986). Section 5 describes the morphological and syntactic
properties of such descriptive words, demonstrating that, contrary to previous claims, they
are indeed nouns.","[182, 183, 184]"

unstressed ones. The position of the stress is predictable: in general, it falls on the last
syllable of the (isolated) word (4). As these examples show, stress follows an iambic
rhythmic pattern, being assigned in a right-to-left fashion (4e-g). By default, primary stress2The Karajá name for their village in Aruanã (Goiás), Buridina [bUr´dI""na], probably derived from Portuguese
Leopoldina (the old name of the town), also illustrates this use of the schwa.

undergo adaptation to conform to the stress pattern of Karajá: bEradU [bEra""dU] ‘treacle’ (<
Portuguese melado [mE""ladU]), Îak´Si [Îak´""Si] ‘taxi’ (< Portuguese táxi [""taksi]), biSik´rEÎa
[biSikrE""Îa] ‘bicycle’ (< Portuguese bicicleta [bisi""klEta]).
The iambic nature of stress assignment in Karajá is especially clear with
morphologically complex words. Notice that, in compounds, the original stress pattern of the
individual stems is ‘rearranged’ in order to follow the iambic pattern. One can assume that,
although stems can be said to carry stress, the position of such stress is not underlyingly
predetermined. Although the stress is, by default, assigned to the last syllable of a stem, its
ultimate position will depend on the morphological or syntactic position of the stem. That is
illustrated below by a compound (5a), a case of derivational suffixation (6b), and by a
vocative phrase involving the vocative interjection, which is stressed (7b). The behavior of
the stress if further illustrated in (8) and (9), which show stress (re-)assignment under
suffixation (8b) and compounding (9b). As shown in (9c), a possessive phrase such asbrOrE-d¸) hUk´)-TÈ ‘cow’s milk’ can be pronounced as two words (in which case both preserve
their primary stress) or as a single phonological word.","[87, 88]"
"3-CTFG-INTR-ask.for=CTFG-PLURAL=CTFG-IMP‘And they asked him for firearms.’
Notice that while (17a) is marked for centripetal direction, the verb in the following
sentence, (17b), is marked for centrifugal direction, a fact rather common in narrative texts.
This suggests that the choice of a centripetal verb is made only to signal a shift in the deictic
center. Once the identity of the new deictic center is stated, the narrator takes a neutral
position. The same tendency can be noticed in the text ‘The Hawk and the Snake’ above. In
Line F, the verb deTeède ‘he/she moved down (hither)’ signals a shift in the deictic center,
reflecting the fact that now the crucial actions are going to take place on the ground.
However, the verb in the following sentence, raao)bidad´)èkreèb´) ‘in order to fight,’ presents
centrifugal marking.
The data presented here suggest that directional marking is commonly used as a tool
to confer dramaticity and dynamism to the narrative. In narrating an event in which an action
can be contemplated from different angles, the speaker rarely adopts a static point of view.
Thus, even the “enemy” can be chosen as the deictic center, if the more intense actions are
taking place in the enemy’s field. Thus, in the text ‘Krysa-my Ijyy,’ the deictic center is
switched to a Xavante man who is shot (18).",[197]

‘firefighter’ (lit. ‘the one who extinguishes fire’)122A likely explanation would be that uri underlyingly contains a [-ATR] vowel in its
first syllable: /Uri/. The surface [+ATR] quality of its first vowel would be a consequence of
vowel harmony triggered by the [+ATR] vowel occurring in its last syllable. The rules of
vowel harmony and palatalization would be in a counter-feeding order. The initial vowel
may very well have been a fossilized intransitive marker, U-, attested with other stems (see
Chapter 4).","[133, 134]"
"8. Final remarksKarajá presents a pervasive and straightforward mechanism to create subordinate clauses,
shared by relative, complement, and ‘adverbial’ clauses alike. This device is clause
nominalization: an entire clause is nominalized and, as such, can occur in all the positions
traditionally occupied by noun phrases (including subject and direct objects, objects of
postpositions, and noun modifiers). Clause nominalization (a syntactic process) differs from
lexical nominalization (a morphological process) in a number of ways, the main one being
that the former preserves all the inflectional properties of the verb. With subordinate clauses
occuring in the position of a bare nominal (that is, a noun phrase not followed by
28Notice that in both nominalizing suffixes, -dV and -TV, ‘V’ is a copy of the last vowel in the verb stem.
260postpositions or an article), the subordinate status of the clause is indicated by stress shift, an
interesting case of non-concatenative morphology which went unnoticed in previous
descriptions of Karajá grammar.","[271, 272]"
"8.3 MorphosyntaxKarajá is an SOV, head-marking language. Core NP arguments—that is, subject and
direct object—are not morphologically marked. Pronominal subjects are expressed by a
series of free pronouns, such as ♀ dIkar´) ‘I’ in (28) below, while pronominal objects are37expressed by a series of bound morphemes, such as wa- ‘1st person’ in (29). In contrast to a
fairly simple nominal morphology, Karajá presents a complex verb morphology, being
traditionally described as having a very irregular fused set of prefixes indicating person,
aspect, object, and direction (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Wiesemann 1986, Maia 1998).
However, a more careful analysis reveals a rather regular, mostly agglutinating morphology,
with separate prefixes indicating person (and cumulatively, mood), direction, and valence
(28). In addition, pronominal direct objects are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29).","[48, 49]"

‘My father will wait for me.’Nominals functioning as subjects and direct objects are not morphologically marked,
but there is a clear-cut distinction between subject pronouns and non-subject pronouns.
Pronominal subjects are expressed by the independent pronouns ♀ dIkar´) (♂ dIar´)) ‘I’, kai
‘you’, and Î´kI (♂ ÎII) ‘he/she/it’, all of which can be pluralized by the morpheme -boho
(dIkar´)-boho ‘we (exclusive)’, kai-boho ‘you (plural)’, and Î´kI-boho ‘they’). Non-subject
pronominal NPs (such as direct objects, objects of postpositions, and possessors) are
expressed by a series of pronominal affixes (Table 11). The noun id´) ‘human, people’
followed by the pluralizer -boho works as a first person plural inclusive pronoun. A major
12Although the word waha would appear to contain the first-person prefix wa-, it cannot be segmented. There
are suppletive forms for both the second- (bU ‘your father’) and third-persons (Î´bÈ ‘his father’).
38difference between nouns such as id´) and real pronouns is in the fact that independent
pronouns such as dIkar´) cannot occur with postpositions or as possessors.
As the examples above suggest, Karajá is predominantly agglutinative, fusion
between morphemes being fairly rare. However, under certain circumstances, person and
voice/valence markers can be merged phonologically, making the morphological
segmentation less obvious. Thus, in the examples below, the second person prefix Îa- fuses
with the transitive marker I- (30b) and with the intransitive marker a- (31):(30)a.ÎadiwÈ5Îeb.Îa-d-I-wÈèÎ-e(31)♂ÎewÈ5Îe

"Lastly, I would like to thank my professors at the University of Chicago, to whom I owe any
merits this dissertation may have. Many of the ideas in this dissertation grew out of classes I
took with Jerry Sadock, Amy Dahlstrom, Michael Silverstein, Salikoko Mufwene, John
Goldsmith, Kostas Kazazis, Anthony Buccini, and Gunnar Hansson, among others. Chicago
provided me with a deeper understanding of the value of theoretical diversity and with a set
of analytic tools which I will forever cherish in my career as a linguist. I was particularly
fortunate to have in my dissertation committee linguists who, while having solid reputations
as theoretical linguists, equally value data-oriented linguistic analysis: Amy Dahlstrom, Jerry
Sadock, and Michael Silverstein. I am particularly indebted to Amy Dahlstrom, not only for
her contributions to my education as a linguist, but also for her kind support and
encouragement, without which this dissertation would not have come to light.viiABBREVIATIONS

INTRODUCTION1. The Iny and their languageThe main purpose of this dissertation is to provide an introductory grammar of Karajá, a
Macro-Jê language spoken along the Araguaia River, in Central Brazil. Karajá has three
mutually-intelligible dialects—Karajá proper, Javaé, and Xambioá. Karajá proper can be
further divided into Northern and Southern Karajá. Combined, the four dialects have a total
of approximately three thousand speakers (Silva 2009), in the Brazilian states of Goiás, Mato
Grosso, Tocantins, and Pará. The dissertation takes into account data of all four dialects,
collected by the author in several field trips. Except for the Xambioá dialect, Karajá is quite
vigorous in sociolinguistic terms, being the first language to be learned by the children and
the language used in everyday life in nearly all of the villages.
Speakers of the four different dialects refer to their people as Iny [i""n´)] ‘people, human’,
and to their language as Iny Rybe [i""n´) rÈ""bE]. Ethnographic naming practices follow in part
the point of view of the Karajá proper, who call their northernmost kin iS´)bIkOwa
‘companion people’ (iS´) ‘people’ + bIkOwa ‘friend, companion’), whence the Portuguese
word Xambioá. Despite their obvious linguistic and cultural communion, the Karajá refer to
the Javaé as iS´)dZu, a term generally reserved for non-Karajá Indians such as the Xavánte.
As we will see (Chapter 2), such attitude has less to do with linguistic differences than with
cultural and historical ones. The Javaé, on the other hand, call the remaining Karajáberohok´) maha)dU ‘the people of the big river [i.e. the Araguaia]’. Non-Indians are called1Îori or, less-commonly, weku or w´l´ (words whose etymologies are unknown).
Bilingualism is very common among the men, who frequently visit the neighboring towns in
order to trade fish and other commodities; some (including entire families) travel even
farther, seeking education or medical treatment.
In this introduction, I provide background information on the language and its
speakers: Section 2 describes the geographic location of the Karajá-speaking tribes; Section 3
discusses the language’s genetic affiliation; Section 4 describes contacts with speakers of
different languages; Section 5 offers a brief appraisal of previous scholarship on Karajá
language and culture; Section 6 describes basic dialectal differences; Section 7 briefly
discusses the circumstances surrounding the collection and elicitation of the data on which
the present dissertation is based. The introduction concludes with a brief grammatical sketch
of the language (Section 8) and a narrative table of contents (Section 9).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

1-CTPT-INTR-move=FUT
‘I will come.’The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionally
define an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, and
productivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence of
direction as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy
(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically that
direction “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack of
lexical generality:By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motion
verbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectional
category. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘to
take away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction is
also found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I go
across.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited175lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of some
sort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectional
status.”
Bybee’s predictions apply well to languages such as Georgian, for example, where
the opposition between the particles mo ‘hither’ and mi ‘thither’ seems to be productive only
with lexemes denoting some sort of “notional direction towards a goal” (Manning
1996:250).33 However, in Karajá all verbs inflect for direction, including those that
apparently do not indicate a motion at all, such as UrU ‘to die’ (2) and EkÈw´TE ‘to get tired’
(3), as shown by the examples below:(4)a.b.rurure

also used for other purposes. Analyzing the use of the directional markers in narrative texts,
this section explores the hypothesis that directional inflection can be used to show empathy
relationships between the participants of the speech act and between narrator and characters33The grammatical category expressed by the opposition between the particles mo and mi is called ‘orientation’
in Georgian linguistics, whereas the term ‘direction’ is used to refer to another grammatical category, which
“consists of a multi-term system of preverbs, arranged in opposed doublets such as ‘in’ versus ‘out,’ ‘up’ versus
‘down,’ etc.” (Manning, op. cit., 250) The use of the term ‘direction’ in this paper coincides with Talmy’s (op.
cit., 135) definition: “[Direction] refers to whether the Figure in a Motion event is moving toward or away from
the speaker.”
176in a narrative text, playing a role similar to what in other languages may be performed by
obviation systems, evidentials, or attitude markers.
Centrifugal direction (‘thither’) is clearly the unmarked member of the
centrifugal/centripetal opposition. Not only it can, under certain circumstances, be marked
by a zero prefix, but it is also overwhelmingly more common in narrative and descriptive
texts and everyday verbal interactions. Descriptive predicates, marked with auxiliary clitics
which present directional markers, are always marked for centrifugal direction. Furthermore,
verbs in the imperfective (marked by the clitic èr-a) cannot inflect for centripetal direction
(an exception which remains to be explained) and there seem to be pragmatic restrictions as
to the occurrence of centripetal marking with verbs in the progressive (marked with the
auxiliary clitic èr-ErI). As we will see (Section 2.2.2), such restrictions demonstrate that
direction can clearly be used with evidential purposes.","[186, 187, 188]"

3-CTFG-INTR-go=HAB=CTFG-IMPRF
‘You better stay, for I’m going far.’Maia (2002:155) analyzes ♂ èdori as a ‘focus marker,’ which is probably a mistake:
being a second-position clitic, it is not surprising that this morpheme occurs after fronted
elements, but that is also the case of most discourse-oriented particles in the language (see
Chapter 4). Fortune (1970) translates it (rightly, I think) as ‘because.’ As a second-position
clitic, èdokuri attaches to the first constituent of the clause, regardless of its syntactic status.
In (79) above, èdokuri attaches to a postpositional phrase. The examples below illustrate its
occurrence with noun phrases (81) and a predicate (82):(81)♂b´-d-a-lOèkE,biuèdori255k´-d-∅-Oaèk´re2-CTPT-INTR-enter=POT

‘I won’t go, because it is dangerous.’
In fact, its distribution and phonological behavior suggest that èdokuri belongs in the
large class of speech-act particles, that inform on the attitude of the speaker with relation to
the utterance (indicating certainty, doubt, excitement, boredom, sympathy, surprise,
assertiveness, resolve, etc.). As other speech act clitics, èdokuri is unstressed; notice that,
unlike adpositions, èdokuri does not change the stress of the verb phrase to which it attaches;
thus, i-Oha)ruèr-eèdori ‘because it is dangerous’ is pronounced [iOha)""ruredori].
Analyzing èdokuri as a speech act clitic helps us to understand the differences
between dokuri-clauses and the reason clauses described above: dokuri-clauses are probably
examples of speech act adverbial clauses, whose function, as defined by Thompson &
Longacre (1985:203) “is not to modify or qualify the main clause in any way, but to modify
or qualify, as it were, the speech act which the speaker is performing in uttering the main
clause.” In fact, most attitude markers can be seen as speech-act subordinators to a certain
extent, since they anchor the utterance to a previous one; in an example such as (83) below,
the attitude markers èTOE ‘enthusiasm’ and èT´) ‘repetition’ can only be interpreted in
reference to a previous speech act (it was jokingly said as a warning to a child who insisted in
climbing a tree against a parent’s repeated admoestation):(83)b´-d-∅-UrUèkreèTOEèT´)

finds nominalized forms of the verbs playing the role of complements. Deverbal nouns may
be preceded by a grammatical possessor which corresponds to the original absolutive
argument of the verb—that is, to the subject of an intransitive verb, such as in wa-rira ‘my
walking’ (from ♀ rika ~ ritSa ‘to walk’), or to the object of a transitive verb, such as inkOÎUd¸) b´)d´) ‘turtle catching.’ (from b´) ‘to catch’). These constructions occur in any of the
functions performed by subordinate clauses (or by any NP, for that matter)—that is, as
subjects (84), direct objects (85) or objects of postpositions (86-91):(84)♀∅-r-I-wa-d-EkÈw´TE-d´)èr-a

In addition, the suffix -dU forms subject nouns (that is, nouns refering to the subject of the
original verb), which can be translated as relative clauses (92). The suffix -da), on the other
hand, forms nouns which name instruments, places, or other circumstances related to the

"4. Complementation15The fact that Maia does not signal any pause between both sentences corroborates my analysis of these
examples as cases of subordination, not juxtaposition of two independent clauses (‘the man threw the arrow; he
saw the guariba monkey’), which would be a rather odd construction in Karajá, given the lack of particles
marking any type of relation between the last clause and the preceding one.
16
Maia’s original transcriptions of these examples are (i) weriri Dolora dewinade kau awire and (ii) Hãbu wyhy
rehura asynihiky-my robina. In addition to the overall shortcomings of Karajá orthography, Maia’s
transcription also presents some inaccuracies of its own. For example, the verb ehu ‘to throw’ takes objects
marked with the instrumental postposition èdI, never a ‘bare’ object as Maia’s transcription suggests. This and
other inaccuracies are corrected in (41) and (42) above.
239Complement clauses are those which occupy the position of a noun phrase, occuring
as arguments of the verb or as objects of postpositions. Like relative clauses, complement
clauses in Karajá are also characterized by stress shift. In (43) below, the subordinate clause
is the subject of the main clause, whereas in (44), the subordinate clause is the object of the
verb ♀ kErÈ, ♂ ErÈ ‘to know’.","[250, 251]"

Thus, there is a strong tendency to assign the role of deictic center to the most salient
character or location, and not necessarily to the character or location which is physically
closer to the speaker. The same tendency is manifested in other, longer texts, such as in the
text ‘Krysa-my Ijyy,’ which tells the story of a war occurred between the Karajá and the
Xavante, their traditional enemies. The text was narrated by a Karajá man in the same
village where some of the narrated events took place. Most of the story is about an
expedition of Karajá warriors to Xavante territory in order to revenge the killing of a Karajá
youth. The Karajá village is initially presented as the deictic center. At a certain point, the
Karajá men ask for the help of Bandeira, a White man, who lends them firearms. This
fragment of the text is reproduced below (17). Notice that the narrator adopts Bandeira’s
viewpoint (dOIdEd´)ède ‘they came’) and not the viewpoint of the Karajá men. This reflects
the more central role played by Bandeira, the man who has the firearms, at this point of the
narrative.","[194, 195, 196]"

most verbs. In nouns, plurality is indicated by at least three different devices: reduplication,
the use of the noun ba)ha)dU ‘group, crowd’, and the attachment of the pluralizer èboho.
Plurality in the verb is marked by the auxiliary -Ed´), which presents the same inflectional
properties of the temporal-aspectual auxiliaries mentioned above. Although it agrees only
with the subject, the auxiliary -Ed´) can express the plurality of the subject, the object, or60both, as the different translations for the example (70) below show. This morpheme occurs
also with oblique pronominal objects (71).","[71, 72]"
"2.2 Temporal constructions7As in English or Portuguese, the verb aha ‘to find’ is also used with an ‘evaluative’ meaning (as in I found the
play annoying). In this case, the evaluative phrase is marked by the postposition èb´):

229The semantics of some postpositions can be further illustrated by their use in
temporal constructions. In addition to the temporal postposition proper, èku, locative èb´)
and instrumental èdI were also attested in temporal uses: rukuèb´) ‘at night’, rukuèdI ‘at
dawn’; bikuraTOèku ‘in the morning’, bikuraTOèb´) ‘tomorrow’; etc. The use of èdI
‘instrumental’ in rukuèdI ‘at dawn’ (literally, ‘after night’) mirrors its use with subordinate
clauses such as (22) below:(22)k´-d-∅-EhEb´)d´)èkreèdI
a-r-∅-aèkre
3-CTPT-INTR-arrive=FUTèINSTR 1-CTFG-go=FUT
‘After he arrives, I will go.’3. Relative clausesFor the sake of terminological clarity, I will adopt here the basic terminology
employed by Keenan (1985). Like Keenan, I regard relative clauses to be full NPs (a fact that
is rather clear in Karajá, where relative clauses can take articles, as we have seen, and
postpositions, as it will be shown below). As Keenan points out, a relative clause typically
consists of a common noun (or a pronoun), the domain noun, optionally accompanied by
determiners, and a restrictive clause: “Semantically the common noun determines a class of
objects, which we shall call the domain of relativization, and the restrictive clause identifies a
subset of the domain, those elements which satisfy the conditions given by the restrictive
clause” (Keenan 1985: 142). Thus, in Îori dOrOède! ‘a White man who arrived’, Îori ‘White
man’ is the domain noun, and dOrOède! ‘who arrived’ is the restrictive clause.
As we have seen, the only surface difference between the independent clause in (1)
and its subordinate counterpart in (2) is in the location of the stress: [Îo""ri do""rode] ‘the White230man came ashore’ versus [Îo""ri doro""de] ‘the White man who came ashore’. In fact, stress
shift is the basic mechanism to mark the subordinate status of relative clauses that modify
core NPs (that is, subjects and direct objects). That the subordinate clause occupies the
position of an NP is further demonstrated by the fact that it can be followed by the enclitic
indefinite article ♀ èdo), ♂ èo) (24), which attaches to the rightmost element of an NP (23). In
addition, an NP modified by a subordinate clause can still act as a possessor, and, in these
cases, the possessed noun will occur after the subordinate clause (25).9 Notice that the
relative clause is postnominal, occurring after the modified noun. This fact, as we will see
(Section 6), reflects the general distribution of modifiers in attributive constructions.","[240, 241, 242]"

In all the examples above, the domain noun occupies the position of core arguments
of the verb (subject or direct object), which are not morphologically marked in Karajá.
However, when the domain noun is an oblique NP, the postposition that marks such NPs will
occur after the restrictive clause, cliticized to the verb (a further argument for the nominal
status of the relative clause). Thus, while with core arguments stress shift may be the only
surface indicator of subordination, in examples such as (28) the postposition can also be seen
as an indicator of the subordinate nature of the clause. Notice that stress shift also occurs in
10kUa ‘that (distant from both the speaker and the addressee)’ is a demonstrative (not a relative pronoun, as the
translation of the example may suggest). There are two other demonstratives in Karajá, ka ‘this’ and kia ‘that
(close to the addressee)’ (see example 40).
232those cases in which the subordinate verb is followed by an article or a postposition. In such
cases, however, stress shift may be analyzed as being triggered by the article or the
postposition (see 3.3 below). Therefore, stress shift will only be indicated in this paper in
cases in which it is the only surface marker of subordination.
In (28) below, the relative clause modifies the object of the verb ♀ rakuSi ‘to eat’ (♂roSi), which is marked by the postposition èb´), as we have seen above (21). The postposition
marking the object will occur after the relative clause. This is further illustrated by examples
of relative clauses modifying the objects of the postpositions èb´), èlaku, and èkI:(28)♂kiaèrEd´)∅-r-∅-´)ièr-ErIèleèb´)thatèPL3-CTFG-INTR-stand.upèCTFG-PROGR=only=LOCb-∅-i-roSièb´)

stand up’. As the example below illustrate, the result is a stative meaning (75a), as opposed

grammaticalized than the converb constructions illustrated above. Since both the subordinate
and the main verbs share the same subject, they tend to form a contiguous, uninterrupted
250construction. In addition, there is at least one clear case in which an auxiliary-like
construction underwent further grammaticalization, resulting in a aspectual marker, as
described in the following section.","[260, 261, 262]"

Subordinate Clauses1. IntroductionThis chapter describes subordinate clauses in Karajá, including relative clauses, complement
clauses, and (the functional equivalents of) adverbial clauses. Although this study is mainly
concerned with subordinate clauses proper (that is, complements or modifiers which present
the internal structure of a full clause), it will also briefly discuss nominalized complements,
very common functional equivalents of subordinate clauses in Karajá.
The basic mechanism to signal subordination, as illustrated by relative and
complement clauses in subject and direct object positions, is stress shift, an interesting
example of non-concatenative morphology. As we have seen, a typical finite verb in Karajá
presents tense-aspect clitics, which are unstressed. In independent clauses, the stress falls
ordinarily on the last syllable of the verb stem (1). In relative clauses, however, the stress
shifts to the tense-aspect clitic (2). The entire subordinate clause behaves as a noun phrase,
and, as such, may take nominal clitics such as the indefinite article (3) ♀ èdo) (♂ èo)) (and, as
we will see, postpositions):(1)Îori ∅-d-∅-OrOèd-e

also be described in this chapter (Section 2). Section 3 will be dedicated to the description of
the properties of relative clauses, providing a background for the discussion of complement
clauses (Section 4) and postpostional clauses (Section 5), which in Karajá play most of the
functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses. Section 6 describes nominalized
complements. Section 7 deals with èdokuri clauses, a case of speech act adverbial
subordination. Section 8 provides a summary of the chapter.","[232, 233, 234]"
"6.3 Interactions between vowel harmony and palatalizationAs we have seen, palatalization is clearly a lexical process in Karajá, whereas vowel
harmony is likely a post-lexical one, occuring across word-boundaries; vowel harmony and
palatalization would be, in traditional terms, in counter-feeding order. There are, however, at
least two cases in which vowel harmony clearly feeds palatalization. These can be seen as
old compounds, which are not synchronically perceived as such. One is the kinship terma)dZikura ‘mother’s older sister’, which results probably from the combination of the
morphemes a)dI ‘mother’ and kura ‘white’41 (compare it with waha ‘my father’ versuswahakura ‘my father’s older brother’). In this case, the high [+ATR] vowel /u/ triggers
vowel harmony in the [-ATR] vowel of the preceding root, which then triggers palatalization
on the voiced stop /d/, as shown by the derivation given below:(96)41input
vowel harmony
palatalization
output/adI-kura/
adikura
adZikura
[adZiku'ra]For a discussion of the use of color terms in Karajá kinship terminology, see Donahue (1982:158).
123Another example in which vowel harmony seems to have fed palatalization is the
particle tSibo ‘approximately’, which is probably the combination of the pro-form ÎI and the
interrogative particle èbo (ÎIbo [""Îibo] ‘how?’ > tSibo):42(97)input

repetition. The entire verb root is reduplicated (98). Again, a bimoraic minimality constraint
is at play: when the root is monosyllabic, reduplication includes all the verb prefixes:(98)(99)a.b-∅-I-krOèkre

analyses of the language, the analysis presented here proposes a larger vowel inventory; a
major contribution of the present analysis lies in demonstrating the relevance of the feature
[ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony. The
reanalysis of the vocalic inventory has substantial consequences for the analysis of the
consonantal inventory as well: palatal consonants, considered as independent phonemes in
previous analysis, are the result of a process of palatalization around [high, +ATR] vowels.
Although the distribution of palatal consonants is fairly predictable from a morphologicallyinformed point of view, a process of phonogenesis seems to be taking place: in addition to
the adoption of loanwords which violate native phonotactic constraints, there are even
minimal pairs (cf. idZ´d´) ‘feces’ vs i-r´d´) ‘his feces’), albeit morphologically conditioned.
Such factors result in a fluid situation in which palatal consonants may end up acquiring
phonological status.","[134, 135, 136]"

immediately preceded by a pronominal direct object or an incorporated noun, the relational
prefix l- is used (38b):
14This is a denominal verb derived from -UahI ‘medicine’. It is tempting to consider the prefix Î- occurring
with transitive verbs as simply a marker of 3rd person object. However, this prefix also occurs with antipassive
constructions (54), which do not allow explicit direct objects.

3-CTFG-INTR-go=CTFG-IMPERFA common characteristic of lowland South American languages is the existence, with
nouns, of different degrees of grammatical possession: there are obligatorily-possessed nouns
(e.g. body-part terms, for instance), optionally-possessed nouns (e.g cultural items), and
nouns which cannot be directly possessed (e.g. items of nature, such as rocks, water, animals,
etc.). That is a well-documented phenomenon in several Macro-Jê languages, including
those of the Boróro, Jê, and Karirí families (Rodrigues 1999:190-192). In the latter case (that
is, items which cannot be directly possessed), generic nouns such as the ones described above
are used as possessive classifiers in indirect possessive constructions, such as 43 below, from
Boróro (Crowell 1977:178). In Karajá, however, that is not the case, as any noun can in
principle be directly possessed (wa-idZOrOTa ‘my dog’, etc.).","[54, 55, 56]"

‘four Xavánte spirits’spirit9. Table of contentsAs I intended to show in this introduction, many aspects of Karajá phonology,
morphology, and syntax (as well as its peculiar system of gender deixis) remain to be
thoroughly understood. However, even a succinct overview of the language reveals a
number of phenomena rich in theoretical and descriptive implications. It is my hope that this
dissertation will provide us with a better understanding not only of the Karajá language, but
also of the general analytical questions its study raises. The following chapters provide an in
depth description of phenomena which are central to the understanding of Karajá.
Chapter 1 provides a thorough account of the language’s phonological inventory,
syllable and stress patterns, and morphophonology. A major difference between the account
given here and those offered in previous sources lies in the vocalic inventory: here it is
shown that the feature [ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’ plays a central role in Karajá
phonology, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony--the first of this kind ever
described for a South American language. [ATR]-ness is also relevant in describing the
second-most common morphophonemic process in the language, palatalization.
Reduplication, maybe the most phonologically-oriented of all word-formation processes, will
also be treated in this chapter.
Chapter 2 deals with an oft-mentioned—yet poorly understood—peculiarity of
Karajá: the existence of systematic differences between male and female speech. As
suggested early on by Ehrenreich (1894), female speech is more conservative, male speech69being generally characterized by the deletion of the velar stop /k/. However, although such
‘genderlectal’ differences are often described as being the result of regular phonological
processes, they can have morphological consequences as well—a fact that went unnoticed in
previous descriptions. The chapter also includes an account of male vs. female speech
distinctions in Javaé, where genderlectal variation is much less prominent (Javaé women
speaking what seems to be a relaxed version of the male speech in the other dialects). A
possible explanation for such a situation, based on a well-documented case of language
contact involving the Javaé, is proposed. Hypotheses on the possible diachronic origins of the
male vs. female speech distinctions are also discussed. Contrary to previous suggestions,
according to which they would be contact-induced (Rodrigues 1999, 2004), the facts seem to
favor an explanation in terms of the language’s own internal historical tendencies.
Chapter 3 describes the language’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition
to morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Verb morphology is where most of Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb
inflects for person (with portmanteau morphemes which also indicate mood), direction
(which also play evidential functions), and voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive),
besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns (sometimes with classificatory purposes).
Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and particles, respectively. As in many other
lowland South American languages, nouns, postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share
person-marking paradigms. Comparative evidence plays an important role in explaining
less-than-transparent morphological devices, such as linking prefixes (which, as it turns out,
are cognates with similar prefixes in other Macro-Jê languages), synchronically invariable
roots with fossilized prefixes, and a non-concatenative mechanism to derive nouns from70verbs. The latter constitute an unusual case of replacive infixation, which, thanks to
comparative evidence, can be traced back to the affixation of a nominalizing suffix.
Chapter 4 deals with complex sentences. Subordinate clauses in Karajá are always the
result of sentential nominalizations, not only in the cases of relative and complement clauses,
but of adverbial clauses as well. It is here claimed that adverbs in Karajá do not exist as an
independent part-of-speech (or, at least, constitute a marginal part-of-speech with very few
members), adverbial functions being played by postpositional phrases. Consequently,
adverbial clauses are postpositional clauses, marked by the same postpositions which mark
nouns. Their use as subordination markers mirrors their use with nouns, even in the case of
converbs—by far, the most common type of subordinate clauses--, which are marked by a
locative postposition. Considering the role they play with adverbial clauses, postpositions are
described in this chapter. A case of discourse (rather than grammatical) subordination, the
=dokuri clause, will also be described in this chapter.
The last chapter, Chapter 5, provides an appraisal of the evidence for the inclusion of
Karajá in the Macro-Jê stock, taking into consideration additional evidence uncovered by the
present study, informed by recent improvements in the reconstruction of Proto-Jê (Ribeiro
2005). Although a relationship between Karajá and the Jê family had been suggested early
by von den Steinen (1884), Karajá was one of the last languages to be included in the MacroJê stock (Davis 1968). As its late inclusion in the stock suggests, the similarities between
Karajá and other Macro-Jê languages are far from obvious. The evidence presented by Davis,
however, is being further corroborated by additional data, as this chapter hopefully
demonstrates. Especially compelling for the hypothesis of genetic relationship are those
instances in which comparative evidence helps explain synchronic irregularities of Karajá, as71in the case of the replacive infix. The chapter demonstrates the interplay between descriptive
and historical linguistics: on the one hand, it shows how a better descriptive knowledge of a
language may contribute to uncover additional pieces of comparative evidence; on the other,
it shows how a better comparative knowledge may contribute to improve our understanding
of synchronic phenomena.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"

labeling the Karajá pospositions, I took into consideration what seems to be their more general, productive, and
non-idiomatic uses (as far as possible).

Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).
According to Blake (1994: 156), evitative (also called ‘aversive’) case markers are also common in Australian
languages.

Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),
226name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,
asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15). As we will see, this semantic
diversity accounts for the use of this postposition to mark both purpose clauses and converbs,
as well as sentential complements of verbs such as say, tell, etc.6(11)♂a-r-∅-aèkre

for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.
6
This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.
227In addition to the paradigmatic peculiarities and wide range of semantic uses, the
‘diffuse locative’ postposition, èb´), presents some distributional peculiarities. As illustrated
by (16) below, in which èb´) occurs as a purpose marker, it can follow other postpositions (in
this case, the ‘static locative’ èkI). [The example also illustrates the use of the dative

Therefore, this process occurs only with a closed set of words, all of them containing

from a Tupí-Guaraní-based lingua franca spoken in Brazil in the first centuries of the

such as the indefinite article èdo), which are intrinsically unstressed.
140in the male speech, becoming ♂ ao)da) [ao)""na], probably due to analogy with its native
homonym, ado)da) ‘thing’.113.3. Lexical differencesIn some cases, the forms occurring in the male and female speech may be totally
different words. That is the case of the vocative interjections (♀ wu, ♂ kÈ) and of the
interjections expressing surprise or admiration (♀ bi, ♂ bEbE). Examples such as these-involving interjections and other “emotive words”--are rather common in other languages.
Fortune and Fortune (1975: 115-6) also mention two other cases in which “the men’s speech
form is totally different from the women’s”—the verbs ‘to cry’ and (in my translation) ‘to
become angry’. This is clearly a mistake. The roots obu and hi ‘to cry’ and TIra and EbUrE
‘to become angry’ are used in both female and male speech to refer to processes happening to
female and male subjects, respectively—a difference having no relation with the female
versus male speech distinctions with which this chapter is concerned.12 Similar examples are
found in Yana, according to Sapir’s (1949) description:11In Javaé, as we will see, only the male forms of the words containing the morphemes ado) and do) were
preserved: ao)da ‘thing’, hirarièo) ‘a girl’ etc. However, the loanword for ‘pineapple’ in Javaé maintains the
original [n] in both male and female speech: ado)da). This example suggests that the drift towards male speech
(if there was indeed one; see Section 6) was already consolidated by the time this loanword entered the
language (cf. section 4).
12
Similar mistakes were made by Ehrenreich (1894), in a time when knowledge of Portuguese among the
Karajá was probably very rare, making communication between outsiders and the Karajá a challenging
endeavor. He listed as male-female speech variants words that actually have different meanings, and are
common to both varieties. That is the case of the words watSiwi ‘cooking pot’ and b´TE ‘plate’, listed by
Ehrenreich as the male- and female-speech forms for ‘pot’, respectively (Ehrenreich 1894:23).
141(…) there is a small number of verb stems which apply exclusively to activity
carried on by a male or by a female; e.g., ni-, ni@- “a male goes” but ‘a- “a
female goes,” bu-ri-, bu-ri@- “a man dances” but dja-ri, dja-ri@-, “a woman
dances.” In the latter case the difference of verb probably reflects an actual
difference in the style of dancing. [1949:206]
Following Sapir, I shall suggest that, for ‘to cry’ and ‘to get angry’, the differences between
the verbs in Karajá would probably also reflect actual differences in the processes of crying
and getting angry. Notice that the verb obu ‘(a woman) to cry’ is also used to refer to the
sounds made by birds and to the ritual wailing of deceased relatives, performed exclusively
by women.
Fortune & Fortune (1963, 16) also include in the same category of ‘totally different’
words the verb ♀ ohokudZa ‘to listen’ (♂ ohola). However, in spite of the somewhat striking
surface differences between the form used in female speech and the one used in male speech,
the latter can be regularly derived from the former by the processes described above: kdropping and vowel deletion. The differences between the consonants occurring in the last
syllable of both forms, dZ versus l, can also be explained as the result of a regular
phonological process. As seen in Chapter 2, the lateral \l\ becomes palatalized when
contiguous to the [high, +ATR] vowels /i/, /È5/, and /u/. In the aforementioned example,
palatalization does not occur in the male form because the vowel /u/, which would trigger it,
is not present. A similar example is ♀ b´dokudZ´kE ‘pirarucu fish’, ♂ b´dOl´kE ~ b´dOlEE.","[151, 152, 153]"

‘As soon as he gets there, they will come for us.’22Haspelmath (1995:3) defines converb as “a nonfinite verb form whose main function
is to mark adverbial subordination” [his emphasis] “Another way of putting it”, he adds, “is
that converbs are verbal adverbs, just like participles are verbal adjectives.”23 At first, from a22This is one of the few examples of a third-person centripetal verb in the realis that does not occur with the
prefix k´-. Possible semantic motivations for the absence of the prefix are being investigated.
23
Similar constructions have been called ‘absolutive clauses’ by some authors. According to Thompson &
Longacre (1985:200-203), absolutive “is a cover term for a subordinate clause type in which the following
conditions hold: (i) the clause is marked in some way as being subordinate; (ii) there is no explicit signal of the
248grammatical point of view, there seems to be no reason to distinguish converbs from the
other postpositional phrases described in the preceding sections. However, there is a crucial
difference between them: while the clauses discussed earlier are commonly marked for tense,
converbs generally are not. Since typical finite clauses in Karajá are characterized by the
presence of a tense-aspect marker, a distinguishing feature of converbs (as opposed to the
other postpositional clauses) is their nonfiniteness (which, according to Haspelmath, is a
definitional characteristic of converbs).
In the majority of the examples, the converb has the same subject as the main clause,
but that is not necessarily the case. As examples (72) and (73) show, converbs with different
subjects are also possible.","[258, 259, 260]"
"8.3.6. Noun incorporationNoun incorporation in Karajá is a process by which the head of the absolutive noun
phrase is inserted into the verb, thereby forming a compound. The more productive pattern of
noun incorporation involves only body-part terms, which are in general inherently possessed
nouns. Since only the head of the absolutive noun phrase is incorporated, the valence of the
resulting noun-verb compound remains unaltered, as the possessor is promoted to subject

‘The people’s bellies were broken there, it is said.’18Examples (55a) and (55b) are from the Javaé dialect. Although Maia (op. cit.: 63) claims that object
incorporation does not occur in Javaé, noun incorporation seems to be as common in Javaé as it is in the other
three dialects. The example below, involving the incorporation of the noun ÎIkOhU I ‘knee’ to the transitive
verb wE I ‘to penetrate’, occurs in the same text from which the examples above were obtained:(a)rIÎIkOhuwere,

A morphologically similar construction involves the combination of body-part terms
with predicates in a fashion similar to what Mithun (1984: 863) labels ‘classificatory noun
incorporation’ (57b). In such cases, the noun stems are body-part terms that ordinarily
function as measure terms (57a), such as ra ‘head’ (measure term for potatoes and yams), ru
‘eye’ (measure term for grains), and wE ‘belly’ (measure term for round fruits):

‘Are you the one who knows Karajá?’8.13 NumeralsKarajá has numeral words (or constructions) for the concepts ‘one’ to ‘twenty’. For
numerals ‘one’ to ‘five’, there are single words (81). Some of these numerals seem to be
made up of more than one identifiable, albeit fossilized, morpheme, including third person
prefix i-, bIkOwa ‘companion’, èdo) ‘indefinite article’ (as suggested by stress and its
behavior in male speech), and kÈre ‘half’. The use of words such as ‘companion’ with the
numeral ‘four’ is also found in other lowland South American languages (Green 1997), and
could be an areal phenomenon. The numeral ‘five’ could arguably (and rather speculatively)
65be segmented as i-ru-kÈrE [3-eye-half] ‘the half (of both hands?)’, a descriptive construction
including ru ‘eye’, the classifier for ‘round, small things’ such as beans, beads, and coins.","[76, 77]"

phrase is inserted into the verb, thereby forming a compound. The more productive pattern of
noun incorporation involves only possessed nouns—that is, productive noun incorporation in
Karajá is a possessor-raising strategy. Since only the head of the absolutive noun phrase is
incorporated, the valence of the resulting noun-verb compound remains unaltered, as the198possessor is promoted to subject with intransitive, unaccusative verbs such as bOhO ‘to break’
(38), or to object with transitive verbs such as Î´ka I ‘to tie’ (39):41(38)a.id´)wEèrIkIpeople bellyèNARRÎai∅-r-a-bOhOèr-e3.LOC 3-CTFG-INTR-break=CTFG-IMPERF‘The people’s bellies were broken there, it is said.’b.id´)èrIkIÎai∅-r-a-wE-bOhOèr-epeople NARR 3.LOC 3-CTFG-INTR-belly-break=CTFG-IMPERF

incorporating transitive verb can still be made passive or antipassive.
41Examples (21a) and (21b) are from the Javaé dialect. Although Maia (op. cit.: 63) claims that object
incorporation does not occur in Javaé, noun incorporation seems to be as common in Javaé as it is in the other
three dialects. The example below, involving the incorporation of the noun ÎIkOhU ‘knee’ to the transitive verb
wE ‘to penetrate’, occurs in the same text from which the examples above were obtained:

Noun incorporation of body-part terms is generally used to form compound verb
stems with a more specific meaning, refering to ‘nameworthy’ activities, such as ÎI-Î´ka in
example (39) above: while other animals can be tied in different ways, a bird is more
commonly tied by the legs. A similar example, overheard from a man instructing his son on
how to kill a chicken, is given below (41). Additional examples are kO-krO [wood-cut] ‘to
clear (a garden)’, kO-TUhO [face-wash] ‘to wash [someone’s] face’, and -OÎI-krO -OÎI-krO
[neck-cut] ‘to cut [someone’s] neck’. Although every incorporating construction is said to be
replaceable with a more analytical, non-incorporating version, there is a tendency to use
incorporation for more idiomatic compounds: kO-TUhO ‘to face-wash’, for instance, refers to
a ritual in which someone washes the face of a masked performer (cf. Toral 1992), although
it can also be used literally. The same can be said about -OÎI-krO, which has an idiomatic use
(‘to become downcast (Portuguese cabisbaixo)’), in addition to a literal one, ‘to cut [one’s]
neck’.","[209, 210, 211]"

"5.2 HeadshipThe data analyzed here clearly demonstrate that words denoting adjectival concepts in
Karajá are nouns—especially abstract nouns. These nouns present a morphological behavior
identical to obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding to attributive constructions
such as the angry man, Karajá presents a possessive construction, the man’s anger. This
would imply that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” word would be, in fact,
the head of the noun phrase. Uncommon as this may seem, such a situation is reminiscent of
what happens in Tupinambá and Aleut, for example.
In Tupinambá, a Tupí-Guaraní language once spoken along the Brazilian coast,
Rodrigues (1996) also treats descriptive words in Tupinambá as nouns; “
Muitos nomes designam qualidades ou estados, tais como orÈ!B ‘alegria’, -asÈ! ‘dor’, -u!n
‘pretume, escuridão’, pira!N ‘vermelhidão’, pora!N ‘beleza’, kane/o) ‘cansaço’, ma/enwa!r

têm sido muitas vezes considerado adjetivos ou verbos descritivos. Entretanto, morfológica e

3SUBJ-finishA similar situation is presented by the ‘relative-anaphoric’ construction in Aleut
(Sadock 2000). Sadock describes it as a “highly favored structure in Aleut,” which is
“deployed in a surprising array of formally and semantically distinct cases”, including
genitivization (74), nominal modification (75), and relativization (76).45(74)Aleut (Sadock 2000)

However, according to Sadock (op. cit.), in (41) and (42) “the notional modifier is theformal head of the phrase. […] Despite the formal headship facts, the relative case NP (the
counterpart of a possessor) is the semantic head.” Thus, the relative-anaphoric construction
in Aleut presents a striking similarity with genitive-like constructions in Karajá (and in Jê,
and in Tupí-Guaraní). The distribution of the relative case marker in Aleut in (39)-(41) is
extremely similar to the distribution of relational prefixes in Macro-Jê.","[230, 231]"

258Verb nouns can also be used as (notional) modifiers of other nouns, both as predicates
(93a) or attributes (93b). Notice that constructions such as Î´kÈ TUrO can be translated as
‘washed clothes’ or ‘the clothes’ washing’, being structurally identical to genitive phrases.

attributive constructions.","[269, 270]"

agreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (46a) or transitive (46b). Person agreement
markers are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and past
tenses) and the other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes are
listed in Table 12 below.1515The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.

"3.4. Exceptions, obligatoriness, and variation142Although it is a very productive process, applying even to loanwords, there are a few
exceptions to the k-dropping rule. These are mainly grammatical words, such as the personal
pronoun kai ‘you’, the demonstratives ka ‘this’, kua ‘that (far from both the speaker and the
addressee)’, and kia ‘that (close to the addressee)’, the locative postposition èkI, the verb
particles èk´re ‘future marker’ and èkE ‘potential marker’, and discourse markers, such as
èr´kI ‘narrative’. I am not aware of any noun or verb roots constituting absolute exceptions
to the k-dropping rule.
Although the previous studies do mention the existence of such exceptions, they fail
to notice a very remarkable fact. Even among the words for which the k-dropping rule is
possible there are differences concerning the degree of obligatoriness with which the
differentiation takes place. That is, while for some words k-dropping is obligatory, for others
it is optional. According to this criterion, words presenting a velar stop may be classed into
three different categories: (a) absolute exceptions, that is, words for which the deletion of /k/
does not occur at all; (b) words for which the k-dropping rule is optional; (c) words for which
the k-dropping rule is obligatory.13 Tables 3, 4, and 5 below show examples of members of
each class:Table 3.3. Class a: absolute exceptions to the rule of k-dropping

ruÎǨThat these differences do not relate to criteria such as morphological status or part-ofspeech is shown by the fact that each of the three subject pronouns behaves in a different
way. For the first person pronoun, k-dropping is obligatory: ♀ dIkar´), ♂ dIar´). The second
person pronoun, kai, belongs to the small class of absolute exceptions. Finally, for the third
person pronoun, Î´kI, k-dropping is optional. The same assumption is also valid for the
postpositions: while the locative postposition èkI belongs to Class a, the dative postpositiond´kE belongs to Class b, and the temporal postposition èku to Class c. Finally, the same
differences in behavior occur with affixes: although k-dropping is obligatory with the first
person irrealis prefix ka-, it is optional with the third person irrealis prefix k´-.
Furthermore, the k-dropping rule does not apply equally to all the occurrences of the
velar stop in a given word. If two adjacent syllables in the same word contain a /k/, the144tendency is that only one of its occurrences will be deleted, generally the first one: ♀ kOka
‘to shred’ (♂ Oka); ♀ kukO ‘to lift’ (♂ ukO). It is plausible that at least some of these
restrictions are due to phonological constraints, such as to limit the number of vowels in a
row. Also, at least some cases of obligatory male-female speech differentiation can be stated
in phonological terms. Thus, the velar stop seems to be always deleted when occurring
before /u/. Thus, in the male speech form corresponding to ♀ kowoku ‘mortar’, k-dropping
is obligatory in the last syllable, but optional in the first (♂ kowo, owo).14 The deletion of
the velar stop seems to be generally optional in the cases described in section 2.1.2, which
involve schwa assimilation. On the other hand, differentiation is always obligatory in the
cases described in section 2.1.1 above, in which vowel fusion takes place (♀ bEraku ‘river’,
♂ bero), and in section 2.1.3, involving epenthesis (♀ ikOrO ‘fox’, ♂ idZOrO). Thus, the
differentiation between male and female speech seems to be obligatory exactly in those cases
in which the differences between the words in both gender dialects are more salient.
Some morphemes seem to be on the borderline between Class a and Class b. That is
the case of the ‘augmentative’ morpheme -hVk´), which generally preserves the velar stop in
the male speech, such as in ♀ berohok´) [river-big] ‘great river (the Araguaia)’, ♂bErakuhuk´). Although this morpheme may occasionally occur without the velar stop in the
speech of some individuals, this is very sporadic, and considered wrong by the majority of
the speakers. Therefore, although the classification suggested here accounts for the behavior14Therefore, examples such as kowoku ‘mortar’ belong simultaneously to classes b and c.
145of most of the Karajá lexicon, one has to keep in mind the influence of factors such as
hypercorrection in the performance of individual speakers and the impact analogy may have
had in the development of such distinctions.
Thus, there is a great deal of variation in the pronunciation of Class b words, not only
among different speakers, but even in the speech of the same individual. A good example of
the variation in the use of Class b words occurs in the examples below, from a text narrated
by a Northern Karajá man, in which both forms of the verb Î´ka ‘to tie’ occur in the same
sequence:(16)Îar´kI´n´)SiwEirOdU dErarIÎ´kare,Îaèr´kI

‘Then Kynyxiwè tied the arms of the animals, and tied the deer with a rope.’
Therefore, forms such as Î´ka should be better considered as neutral in terms of
female versus male speech distinctions, since they do not necessarily indicate anything about
the sex of the speaker. Thus, while (17a) is clearly a female speech form and (17b) is clearly
a male speech form, (17c) can occur in the speech of both males and females. Thus, male
speech is characterized by a higher degree of variation, which is not available in the female
speech.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"
"2.1Subject agreement173Person agreement displays a strictly nominative pattern, with the verb always
agreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (2a) or transitive (2b). Person agreement markers
are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and past tenses) and

English or Portuguese, on the other, is that in Karajá there are no lexical opposites for
direction, such as English come versus go and bring versus take. In Karajá, such a
distinction is completely dependent on the morphological mechanisms that are made
available by the language. Thus, in the examples below, the prefix r- indicates that the event
is seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (centrifugal direction),
32The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the

62There is one basic negative morpheme in Karajá, -ko); suffixed to the verb, it negates
the entire sentence (73). It can also occur with the pro-form ♀ ado) ‘thing’ (♂ao)), forming a
negative particle which negates individual constituents of the sentence (74) and also occurs
in answers to yes/no questions (75b). The negative morpheme, followed by the imperfective
clitic, can also be used in such circumstances (75c). An emphatic morpheme, hÈkÈ (♂hÈkÈ),
occurs with ado)ko) or a verb to convey a strong negation (75d).","[73, 74]"
"5. Adverbial clausesKarajá apparently has few, if any, true adverbial clauses, a fact that mirrors the
overall lack of adverbs in the language.19 Corresponding to locative adverbs (‘here’, ‘there’,
‘hither’, ‘thither’) and temporal adverbs (‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’), Karajá has demonstrative
pronouns (ka ‘proximal’, k´da) ‘distal’) followed by postpositions (kaèkI ‘here’; ♀ kaèku, ♂kaèu ‘yesterday’; ♀ k´da)èku, ♂ k´da)èu ‘the day before yesterday; the day after tomorrow’).
Corresponding to manner adverbs (‘quickly’, ‘swiftly,’ etc.), Karajá has nouns followed by
the postposition èb´) (wÈèb´) ‘quickly,’ etc.). Thus, just as most adverbial functions are
played by postpositional phrases, functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses are
played by ‘postpositional clauses’ in Karajá. Below are examples of allative, locative, and
temporal clauses:(51)♀i-r´bI a-hEèb´)

19One candidate for adverbhood would be widZi ‘today, now’. The locative morphemes ÎU, Îab´), and Îai
(which, as we have seen, are suppletive third-person forms of postpositions) could also be alternatively
analyzed as adverbs. Even if these morphemes are considered as adverbs, this would be a closed class in
Karajá.

Notice that the adverbial-like subordinate clauses above are structurally identical to
relative clauses which modify oblique domain nouns (as seen in Section 3 above), except for
the lack of a domain noun. That is, the locative clauses above can be analyzed as headless
relative clauses. This structural identity between relative clauses and adverbial clauses is not
unusual. As Thompson & Longacre (1985:179) point out, adverbial clauses expressing time,
location, and manner can commonly be paraphrased, in many languages, “with a relative
clause with a generic and relatively semantically empty head noun: time, place, and
way/manner, respectivelly;” such clauses have also in common the fact that they can be
replaced by a single word, an adverb, such as today (time), here (location), and quickly
(manner) in English and other languages with a clear class of adverbs.","[253, 254]"

sentences including the verb form ♀ rekurO ‘(it/one) crossed’ (♂reurO). Thus, ‘six’ is
literally ‘(it) crosses to one (at the other) hand’; ‘sixteen’ is ‘(it) crosses to one at the foot’,
and so forth. The data for the higher numerals are given here in a very careful—didactic,
even--form. In casual speech, and especially in itemized counting, both the allative
postposition èkO and the verb can be suppressed. Depending on factors such as speed and
informality, constructions such as these can be pronounced as a single phonological word (in
which case vowel harmony may take place) or as two separate words: e.g. [""debo""Toho""dZi] ~
[dE""bO Toho""dZi] ‘six’. Currently, the overwhelming tendency is to have such constructions19In Javaé, the numeral ‘one’ is lohodZi; the correspondence Javaé /l/ :: Karajá /T/ is not a regular one.

by the incorporation of OÎI). It is more likely, however, that OÎI-TIra is a compound, in which case
incorporation would have taken place only once.
