"Why is Bora so interesting?
The Bora phonology is rich in nonsegmental phenomena. There is an elaborate tone system, intimately tied to both the lexicon and the grammar.
(An entire chapter is dedicated to tone, and it is discussed in virtually
every chapter.) Various phenomena are sensitive to syllable weight, and
perhaps conditioned by foot structure.
Morphologically, Bora is fairly agglutinative. There are many suffixes
and few— if any— prefixes. Many apparent prefixes are proclitics.
Typologically, Bora is an OV language. Evidence for this claim is as
follows:
1. Both Subject-Object-Verb and Object-Subject-Verb are common
word orders. Predicate complement clauses generally have Complement-Subject-Verb order.
2. There are postpositions, e.g., in the locative construction, but no prepositions.
3. In the genitive construction the possessor precedes the possessed.
4. Adjectives may precede the nouns they modify but it is more common
for the modifier to follow the head in an appositive phrase. (This is a
consequence o f the role played by the classifiers in forming referring
expressions.)
5. Auxiliary verbs follow the semantically main verb (which is structurally
subordinate to the auxiliary verb); see, for example, section 4.3.6.
Bora has a strong case system implemented by suffixes. There is an
interesting animacy-controlled inversion o f the direct object and recipient
(goal).
Perhaps the most outstanding feature of Bora grammar is the presence
o f a large number of classifiers and the various ways they are exploited in
carrying out reference. Strikingly, apposition— not constituency— is the
primary “ glue” for creating referring expressions.
In forming discourses, Bora has a remarkable system o f sentential con­
nectives, one that exploits the classifiers to provide great intersentential
cohesion.

THE INDEX:In the index, entries are ordered according to the English alphabet. Bora
words are written according to the Bora writing system (the “ practical
orthography”) to facilitate finding them in alphabetical order.
EXAMPLES:Examples generally present four types of information. The position of
these parts varies in the interest o f saving space. (1) The Bora example is
written in a phonetic or phonemic form using the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA). (2) The example is also written in the Bora writing
system, with this sort o f font (sans serif). This is sometimes located
above the phonetic / phonemic representation and sometimes following
the phonetic / phonemic form (in parentheses). (3) A
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss is given either below the Bora example or
in parentheses following it. (4) A free translation follows, either on a line
below the morpheme-by-morpheme text or following it at the end o f the
line.
BORA C ITATIO N FORMS:(a) Words given “ in isolation” (i.e., without any preceding or following
text) may meet the conditions for the application of either PLTS or FLTS.
If so, the isolation form will be the output o f the rule (which is how it
would be pronounced in isolation). (b) Sometimes the phonetic /
phonemic representation of words, roots, affixes,...make lexically
©2012 SIL International ®Conventionsx x x iiimarked tones explicit, as discussed below, while omitting the tones of
other syllables. (c) When verbs are cited, the phonetic / phonemic
representation may make lexically marked tones explicit whereas the
orthographic form gives the nonfinite form; see section 4.1, page 100,
especially figure 4.1. For example, akpakhumrn (awacunu) ‘to yawn’.
PHRASE MARKERS:Phrase markers ( “ trees”) with which structure is represented are
intended as suggestive, neither definitive nor what would might be
expected for any particular theoretic perspective. Some sentences are
given with a rather flat structure. This makes it easier to deal with Bora’s
relatively free word order, but at the cost o f sometimes obscuring
subcategorization relationships. For example, see the tree given for
example 662, page 277. Some affixes are treated as separate syntactic
constituents; for example, case markers are treated as postpositions.
TONE DERIVATIONS:The Bora forms in tone derivations are written as Bora people normally
read and write their language. Tone derivations use the font with
which this sentence is written.
LETTERS REPRESENTING USES OF TONE:We sometimes use v to highlight a high tone and v to highlight a low
tone. Further, to help the reader keep track of different uses o f tone, we
sometimes indicate the use by writing a small letter over the vowel.
These letters are as follows:

The grammatical relations o f causatives are further discussed in section
10.3.3.
Adding -mei ‘reflexive or passive’ after -teho ‘causative’ yields only the
passive interpretation in which the subject (o f the whole) is the causative
agent (the one who caused the action):

object is marked with -§m ‘goal’ and the causee is marked as the direct
object, and (2) reflexivization identifles the direct object with the subject,
then example 256 is problematic. We assume that the agent of H IT is the
subject and the patiënt is the direct object, as consistent with UTAH , the
“ uniformity of theta assignment hypothesis” (Baker 1988:46f).
• If, on the one hand, we flrst apply causativization and then reflexiviza­
tion, as in the first diagram in figure 5.5, the order o f verbal suffixes is
correct but the subject o f the whole is incorrectly identified as the agent
of HIT.
• If, on the other hand, we apply reflexivization before causativization, as
in the second diagram in figure 5.5, the verbal suffixes are incorrectly
ordered. Further, the patiënt of H IT ends up as the direct object rather
than the goal, so would incorrectly bear -khe (-ke) rather than -§m (-vu)
(as in 256).","[178, 179]"

b. He* got that in order that he^ eat it.
C O M P L E M E N T CLAUSES:In 538 i max$ho-nè (self eat-(n)) is the complement o f the ïmi^e- ‘to want’.
In 538a the subject of the complement is i ‘self’, which is bound by the
subject o f the higher verb. By contrast, the overt pronoun in 538b must
not be bound by the subject o f the main clause, so necessarily refers to
someone other than the subject o f the main clause:
(538) a. Im fllém é im ajchone.
b. Im fllém é dibye m ajchone.imi^é-mé
want-(AnPl)
a. They want to eat.
b. They want him to eat.
Likewise, in 851b, page 328, the anaphoric subject of the complement is
bound by the subject of ‘to want’ (whether indicated by a classifier as in
851a or by an overt personal pronoun as in 851b).
R E L A T IV E C L A U S E S :In 1030, page 392, the subject of the relative clause, indicated by i ‘self’,
is coreferential with the subject of the main clause.
In 539, the three cases o f i ‘self’ refer to the subject o f the main clause.
The two that are underlined indicate the subjects o f subordinate clauses;
the other (in the first word) is part of a possessive pronoun:
(539) Ih n e im u jtatsón e im flleebe dihne iujcune.

[ti?-pè i mxkhm ]-nè your-(0) self obtain -(0)
‘Having caused the loss of his own, he wants to get yours.’
We now turn to cases in which the anaphor is the modifier (possessor)
in a genitive construction. In 540a the anaphor i ‘self’ modifies (possesses)
©2012 SIL International ®8.3. THE ANAPHOR I ‘SELF’239‘house’ and refers to the sentence’s subject (John). By contrast, in 540b
the personal pronoun ti-:pie must refer to someone outside o f this domain,
that is, someone other than John:
(5 4 0 ) a. Jóaa p ee ihjyavu.
b. Jóaa p éé dffbyé ja vu .hóaa phé:-?i

ha-§m
that-(SgM) house-goala. ‘John* went to his* house.’
b. ‘Johnj went to hisj house, (i = j ) ’
And i ‘self’ behaves as an anaphor when it is part of a free possessive
pronoun. For example, i?pe ‘self’s (thing)’ must refer to something pos­
sessed by the referent of a nearby expression,one close enough to bind
the anaphor. In 564, page 248, it refers to the sentence’s subject.
Although i ‘self’ behaves like a typical anaphor in the majority of cases,
some cases are unexpected. For example, in 541 it refers to the subject of
the sentence, but that subject is outside o f the immediate clause o f the
anaphor:
(541) Jóaa w aajacu foohffbye ds+j+véne.

teihï^é ]-nè
John know-(t)
self
dog-(SgM) die

‘John* knows that his* dog died.’
Example 542 is perhaps even more problematic. Generally anaphors must
be coreferential to a noun phrase that is in a structurally more prominent
position. However, in 542 i refers from within the subject to the direct
object, which presumably is not more prominent:
(542) Io o h ffb ye Jóaake thdóhi.

ï?tó-?i

dog-(SgM) John-objAn bite-(t)‘John*’s dog bit himj.’Technically, the binding expression should c-command the anaphor. Fur­
ther, subjects generally c-command objects, but objects do not c-command
subjects. This may be evidence that Bora has a “ flat” structure, one lacking
a verb phrase. However, this raises other questions beyond the scope of
this grammar. We leave the question as an outstanding research issue.","[271, 272, 273]"
"5.1Basic sentence structureThe basic clause has a subject and a predicate, and the subject precedes
the predicate. For example, in 209 the subject is the noun phrase o:?i:piè
‘dog’ and the predicate is the verb teï:nè ‘run’:
(209) (3:?i-:pié
teï:né-?i (O ohn bye ds+tnéhi.) ‘The d og runs.’
d o g - ( SgM ) run-(t)
The subject may be a free, preverbal pronoun, as in 210:©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 5. M AIN CLAUSES AND VERBS126(210)a:nm $hèmé-?i (A an u ch em éh i.) ‘This one (SgM) is sick.’
this be.ill-(t)
A clause may contain many other phrases, the order of which may vary
considerably. (This word-order flexibility is undoubtedly due to Bora’s
healthy case system.)
When the subject is an overt, preverbal pronoun, if it is either first or
second person and either dual or plural, then the verb bears the proclitic
me ~ ma1 ‘nonsingular speech-act participants’, which will be glossed SAP.
For example, in 211 the subject is first person plural exclusive (that is, it
does not include the hearer); in both the conditional and the main clause
the verb bears me ‘ SAP’:
(2 1 1 )f mf muha m ecu w aca tsa muha m echém étu róhi.
im i? m m ?a mè khrnkpa-khagood we.ex SAP sleep-CF
teha? mm?a mè ^hémé-thm-ró-?i
not we.ex SAP be.ill-neg-frs-(t)
‘ If we (ex.) had slept well, we would not have gotten sick.’
In 212 the subject is second person plural:
(2 1 2 ) im f amuha m ecuwahajchn tsa amuha m echém éftyuróhi.imi? amm?a mè khrnkpa-?ax$hi:

‘ If you (pl) sleep well, you are not likely to get sick.’
Of course, me ~ ma- ‘SAP’ is not used when the subject is third person;
compare 213 with 211-212:

Enclitics (which we generally refer to simply as “ clitics”) have syntactic or
semantic “ scope” over an entire phrase. They attach themselves phonologically to the last word o f a phrase.1 Bora uses the following types of
clitics (among others, e.g., the personal pronominal subject proclitics of
table 10.1, page 270):
1. Second p o s it io n clitics occur only following a clause’s first con­
stituent; these include:
(a) TEMPORAL, i.e., ones that indicate tense (the time of an event rel­
ative to the time o f speaking) are -phe ~ -© o ‘remote past’, -(?)ne
‘recent past’, and -iikjhè ~ -i ‘future’. These are discussed in section
5.9.3. They are also included in figure 11.1; note that they do not
all occupy the same position relative to the other clitics.
(b) EVIDENTIAL, i.e., ones that indicate how the speaker came to know
what she or he is reporting; see section 11.1.
(c) The verb ‘to be’ ixkjha has become a second-position clitic in a type
o f predicate complement structure; see section 5.10.2.
2. ADVERBIAL clitics follow various classes o f sentence constituent; see
section 11.2.
3. A NEGATIVE clitic is discussed in section 13.3, page 13.3.
The clitics occur in the order given in table 11.1:
*W e do N O T intend a strong claim that the morphemes discussed here are strictly clitics as
opposed to suffixes. Examples like 790, in w hich -ro ‘ frs’ precedes -:pè -(S gM ), suggest that
-ro is a suffix rather than a clitic.","[337, 338, 339]"
"©2012 SIL International ®Chapter 7Nouns and Noun Phrases
Noun phrases refer to persons, animals, things and abstract ideas (actions,
events, states). They are formed from nouns, pronouns, numbers, nonfi­
nite verbs, and classifiers.
To join elements with a noun or noun phrase to form referring expres­
sions, generally languages make liberal use of constituency, conjunction,
and compounding. Bora, by contrast, favors other mechanisms because it
has an ample set o f classifiers. These play a major role in the formation of
noun phrases, arguably heading them. For example, in the-tehi ‘that baby’,
the head is the classifier -tehi (baby) and this is modified by the demon­
strative “ adjective” the(:)- ‘that’. See chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of
classifiers.
Various mechanisms for forming referring expressions are given in ta­
ble 7.1 roughly in the order o f their frequency of use.1 The significance of
this table should become clear as this chapter is read.
1In table 7.1 “ N P ” should not be understood strictly as a phrase projected from a noun,
but loosely as a set o f elements (morphemes, words, phrases, not necessarily contiguous) that
cooperate in form ing a referential expression.","[222, 223]"

‘not’ in the previous examples) and the classifier subject occupies the place
o f -ne (0). Thus, two arguments for the claim that these negatives are sub­
ordinate are not available; the only available argument is that the first syl­
lable of the verb bears high tone (as characteristic of subordinate clauses).
Examples follow. In 846, -©:pè (SgM) delinks the low tone o f -© thm ‘neg’
in order to place its low tone on -thm.

that the referent o f the phrase to which it is cliticized was or did what has
been asserted (or assumed) about it. The form -hi:§a is used at the end of
a sentence and -hi: is used within a sentence. -hi:(§a) may be cliticized to
verbs (13.3.1) or to nominals (13.3.2).

and understood. For example, lb is drummed as in la (with no extra pause
at word boundaries).
(l)a.HL
H H L L
b. ?i kjho: kha cé ti $ha
icyoocaré
dicha‘Come here now!’Because many words have identical tone and syllable patterns it is necessary to have standardized phrases. A given message may have a number
of different phrases; these may be repeated several times and in varying
orders, but the word order within each phrase is rigid.
How someone would be called to come is illustrated in table 1.1. First,
the call notice is drummed. This varies depending on whether one or more
than one person is being called, and on whether the person (or persons) is
instructed to come immediately or at their convenience. Second, the name
of the person or persons being called is drummed, first the clan name and
then the personal name (or names). Finally, the purpose for wanting the
person(s) to come is drummed.

the distinction between short and long vowels, or between heavy and light
syllables. Although no study has been made o f the effectiveness o f drum
communication (what range o f messages can be communicated, if techniques are used to increase redundancy, how frequently “ repairs” must
©2012 SIL International ®1.8. THE BORA SIGNAL DRUMS25be made, and so forth), it is clear that some level o f communication is
possible. For example, Thiesen once needed his tape recorder, which was
in a downriver village. Knowing that someone was travelling upriver, he
had a drummer ask that the traveller bring it. Thiesen got what he had requested. On another occasion the chief from a downriver village drummed
to the chief from an upriver village, asking him to send something down
with Thiesen (who was travelling downriver).","[57, 58, 59]"

Neither ordering o f reflexivization and causativization yields a satisfactory

that, when transitive verbs are causativized, the subject (causee) becomes
the direct object and the direct object becomes a goal.

stood that the referents o f the subject caused each other to do the action
indicated by the verb; for example:
17In many cases the causative suffix has /o/, whereas in 263 and 257 it has /a/. This
reflects the fact that most speakers o f the Ineje dialect apply a rule w h ereby -teko becomes
-te^a b efore -mèi.","[179, 180]"
"©2012 SIL International ®1917.1. APPOSITION‘man’ is inherently animate, singular and masculine. The other noun
phrases share those features by virtue of the classifier -:pè (SgM).
Numeral phrases and other quantifying phrases work the same way.
For example, in 392 the numeral phrase teha?oxtehi ‘five’ combines with
the classifier -me (AnPl); this combination is followed by the appositive
noun (the animate plural suffixes providing the referential linkage):
(392) Tsahojts+meva wajpiïmu tsaahi.
teha-?oxtehi-mè-§a
kpaxphi:-mm teha:-?i
one-(hand)-(AnPl)-plQ man-plAn come-(t)‘Five men

classifier:
(393) nè-:pé-§a-a
© [i
© $i:] (neebévaa fllif) ‘said his son’
say-(SgM)-rpt-rem
self
son
A noun may be in apposition to a pronoun. For example, in 394 tha:
kha:ni ‘my father’ is in apposition to the pronoun a:nm ‘this (SgM)’:
(394) Aanu taacaani tsaahi.
a:nm
© tha: © kha:ni teha:-?i
this(SgM)
my
father comes-(t)‘This, my father, comes.’A demonstrative adjective is made a demonstrative pronoun by the
addition of a classifier. The noun it modifies is structurally appositive to
it.

(© mékpa-m:?jo-khè
that- (mother)

above the relative clause is appositive to the subject of the clause (the
man); in 399 it is appositive to the direct object (the squirrel) o f the verb
(not given here); in 400, to the goal o f motion, and so forth:
(399) ...néépicyókevaa avyéjuube anuubeke...

kpapé?hi ixkjha-né]-§m
festival-goalanimal-(AnPl) festival be-(0)-goal
‘ ^ t o a festival, to where there was an animal festival...’
The phrases in apposition may be noncontiguous, as in 401, where
max$hó-:pè-khé-hi:§a is in apposition to ti-:piè-khè. (See also 807, page
316.)

eat-(SgM)-objAn-deny
‘Why do you take him who has not yet eaten?’
A negative deverbal adjective may be appositive to a noun or pronoun,
as in 188 (page 116) and 189.
A few words,3 among them mitjha-nè ‘many’, function like prenominal
adjectives, as in 402:
(402) mitjha-nè kpa:-mjm
(mftyane waamyu) ‘many mosquitos’
much-(0) mosquito-pl
However, because these require the classifier -ne (0), the modifier and
head are arguably related by apposition rather than constituency; for fur­
ther discussion see section 7.8.I.2.

Early Attachment. The analyses (given at the foot of the page) generally
favor early attachment. For example, the sentence in 1194a could be
analyzed either as in 1194b or as in 1194c:
(1194) a. ... baajurf me thtune mé nijtyuhi
b. ...[[manioc we peel] we wash]
c. ... [manioc [we peel] we wash]
b. ‘after having peeled the manioc, we wash it’
c. ‘after having peeled it, we wash the manioc’©2012 SIL International ®476APPENDIX G. BORA TEXTSIn 1194b, the direct object ‘manioc’ is attached to the verb ‘we peel’ and
then this phrase is attached t o ‘we wash’. ; hence [[DO s-V] s-V]. In 1194c,
on the other hand, the attachment of ‘manioc’ is deferred until ‘we peel
(it)’ has been attached to ‘we wash’; hence [DO [s-V s-V]].","[508, 509, 510]"

"©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 3. TONE92(b) It could be a low tone prefix (© - ) that forces the initial syllable
to bear high tone: #©-cr...-suffix. (The host’s first syllable would
have to bear high tone to avoid violating the *LLX constriant.)
This suggestion can be immediately rejected. Recall that o ‘I’,
m ‘you’, i ‘self’, and me ‘SAP’ are proclitics that form a tonal
phrase with the following verb. If © occurred between the pro­
clitic and the verb, the proclitic should necessarily bear high tone.
(Otherwise it and the following © - would violate the *LLX con­
straint.) However, this is not the case, as seen in mè max^ho-khi
(SAP eat-pur memajchoki) ‘in order that we eat’ and 1max$hó-nè-ma
(self eat-(event)-with imajchónema) ‘after eating’.
2. The initial high tone would be imposed by an independent process of
subordination, and the suffixes of table 3.3 would subcategorize for a
subordinate clause. For example, the subcategorization frame o f -(©khi
‘purpose’ would be [[s[+Subordmate]---]_] (the verb being final within
the subordinate clause). This subordination process could be imple­
mented in either of the just-mentioned ways, namely simply imposing
high tone on the verb’s first syllable or by a low tone prefix.
Thus, we adopt the third possibility: (1) the suffixes o f table 3.3 subcatego­
rize for a subordinate clause, and (2) subordination is marked by docking
a high tone on the verb’s initial syllable. The derivations o f imipax^ho-khi
‘to fix’ and max$hó-mè-khè ‘the ones (AnPl) who eat-objAn’ (from exam­
ple 106c) are given in figure 3.34. In the latter, - © ©m e (AnPl) can not
doek its low tone because this would displace the high tone that marks
subordination.30

‘good’ is a predicate adjective modifying the subject kharakha ‘chicken’ but
in 505b it modifies the verb max$hó?i ‘eat’:
(5 0 5 ) a_ f mf caraca.
b. Im f ca ra ca m ajchóhi.a. imi? kharakha
good chicken‘It is a good chicken.’b. imi? kharakha max$hó-?i
good chicken eat-(t)‘The chicken eats well.’The word order in 505b is interesting: it is as though the adverb is predicated o f “the chicken eats.” To characterize the chicken as good— without
“ good” being interpreted as an adverb, as in 505b— it is necessary to com­
bine imi ‘good’ with a classifier and make “ chicken” appositive to the combination, as in 506:
(506) Im iib ye ca ra ca m ajchóhi.
imi-:piè(O kharakha max$hó-?i ‘The good chicken eats.’
good-(SgM)
chicken eat-(t)
Another example of an adjective used adverbially follows:
(5 0 7 ) M ftyan e fm fjyuuvém e.mitjha-nè imihjm-:§é-mè
much-(0) happy-sIn-(AnPl)7.8.5‘They became very happy.’Suffixes added to adjectivesThere are three suffixes that can be added to an adjective: -kpm(:) (wuu
~ wu) ‘diminutive’ (7.8.5.1), -i$ho (ic h o ) ‘somewhat’ (7.8.5.2) (the cooccurrence of these is discussed in section 7.8.5.3), and -(Om^m (-uvu)
‘max’ (7.8.5.4).7.8.5.1 -wuu ~ -wu ‘diminutive, very’
The suffix -kpium (-wuu) ‘dim’ is used to enhance the meaning o f its host.
-kpm is used word finally and -kpium is used when some suffix follows;
compare mé:m-kpm ‘little pig’ with mé:m-kpmm-mm /mé:ni-kpm:-mm/ ‘lit­
tle pigs’.
©2012 SIL International ®7.8. ADJECTIVES227When -kprn(rn) ‘dim’ follows a noun, both the noun’s final and penul­
timate syllables generally bear high tone, as in the examples just given.
Following an adjective the form is generally #O----kpui(m), that is, it im­
poses a low tone on the adjective’s initial syllable, as in 508-509:
(508) aja-kpm urai ( A ya w u uu.) ‘You are very tiny.’
small-dim you
(509) imi-kpm ti:-$è
(Im fw u d iflle.) ‘She is beautiful.’
good-dim that-(SgF)
When #O----kptu(ü) ‘dim’ follows a scalar adjective, it indicates an
extreme degree on the (implied) scale, as illustrated in 510:
(510) Im fw u d+jts++méne.
imi-kpm ti
xtehi:ménè
good-dim your child‘Your baby is very
good (or pretty).’Because imi-kpm ‘very good’ is the predicate in 510, we might expect it
to bear all high tones, but -kpm imposes a low tone on its host’s initial
syllable. For additional examples, compare the a and b sentences in 511
and 512:
(511) a. C h ém épf difbye.
b. Chem épfw u difbye.a. $hémé-phi(?)26 ti-:piè

and 194, page 117.","[259, 260, 261]"
"©2012 SIL International ®10.1. SUBJECT2712. The proclitic and the verb root’s initial syllable may not both bear low
tones because these form a single tonal phrase which must respect the
*LLX constraint.
3. ti ‘you (imperative)’ and i ‘self’ cause a following consonant to be
palatalized. (Palatalization applies across word boundaries only if the
words belong to the same phonological phrase.)
Further, t(i) ‘you (imperative)’ may be ti, t, or 0 (nothing) depending
on the number o f syllables o f the root and whether it begins with a
consonant or a vowel.
If o ‘I’, m ‘you’, or me ‘SAP’ is used as the subject and bears any suffix,
then it is repeated, procliticized to the verb. We will call this PRONOUN
DOUBLING. For example, in 637 o ‘ I’ is followed by -i ‘projected time’, so
the pronoun is repeated:
(637)ó-i o phé-hmkhó:-?i (Ói o péjucóóhi.) ‘I am now about to go.’
I-PT I go-now-(t)
In 638 m ‘you’ is doubled:
(638)m:-3a m phè-é-?i
(U u va u p eé h i.)
‘They say that
you-rpt you go-fut-(t)
you will go.’
In 639 me ‘ SAP’ is doubled; the second cliticizes to the verb:
(639)M etsu m eere m epéékif.mètehm mè-:rè
mè phé:-khi:
let.us SAP-only SAP go-pur‘Let’s go alone.’When me ‘SAP’ is the subject, it can be preceded by mm?a ‘we (ex.)’,
mm?tehi ‘we (DuM)’, or mm?phi ‘we (DuF)’. A word may intervene between
the free pronoun and the pronominal clitic, for example, ti:pièkhè in 640:

a. In basic relative clauses there simply is no such noun phrase. For exam­

referring to a being or object of the type indicated by the classifier; see
chapter 18. In this section we consider subordinate clauses in which the
classifier following the verb is -ne (0 ) ( ‘thing’). These are C O M P L E M E N T S ,
and may function as the subject o f a sentence (16.2.1) or as direct objects
(16.2.2).
Some subordinate clauses, such as that in 948, are ambiguous between
a complement and a relative clause. This comes about because the maximally unspecified classifier -ne (0) may refer either to a object or to an
event, as discussed in section 16.3.

949 the subject is ti:piè phé:nè: ‘that he goes’, i?tatehó(?) ‘sad’ is a predicate
adjective, and the copula is implicit:

axtjhmmi ‘see’, i:the ‘look’, $e:po ‘hear’, imi^e ‘want’, phi:^iethe ‘be able’,
and kpa:hakhm ‘know’. The object complement usually follows the
complement-taking verb, but it may also precede it.
The verb of the complement always bears a high tone on the first syl­
lable and is always followed by
O nE (0)-3 - © O nG does not impose its
(1) on a monosyllabic or bisyllabic verb because the initial syllable must
Lbear high tone. Further, the tones o f # ...- O O ne (0) do not override the
tones imposed by, for example, a preceding - O O tm ‘like’ or -OOi.Pm ‘g°
after doing’.
We now present various examples. Note that in 950a the subject o f the
complement, which is coreferential to the subject of the main clause, is
a pronoun; it is not— as might be expected— an anaphor. By contrast, in
951, in which the subject o f the complement is third person, the anaphor
i ‘self’ is used.

Relations
Case marking suffixes indicate the role o f a noun phrase (or subordinate
clause) with respect to the clause within which it occurs. Bora has the
following case markers: -0 ‘nominative’ for subjects ( 10.1), -khe ~ 0 (with
animate and inanimate phrases, respectively) ‘direct object’ ( 10.2),
‘goal’ or ‘theme’ (10.3), -thm ‘source’ (10.4), -fi ‘inanimate obliques’ (10.5),
-ma ‘with’ (10.6), and -$i:?è ‘motive’ (10.7). In addition to these, there are
two “ pseudo-cases”: -?tm ‘comparative’ (10.8) and -x ‘vocative’ (10.9).
Some of the case-marking alternatives are illustrated in 625. 625a has
a singular transitive verb whereas 625b-d have an intransitive verb.

exception is discussed below.) Subjects are recognized by the absence of
another case marker, by their position in the sentence, or by the classifier
suffixed to the verb.
There are three possible patterns for the subject and predicate, as rep­
resented in 626a, b, and d:
(626) a.","[300, 301, 302]"
"6.2The uses of classifiersThis section surveys the various ways classifiers are used. Classifiers may
follow finite verbs to indicate the subject (6.2.1). Aside from this case,
what precedes the classifier modifies the classifier. This may be a simple
adjective (6.2.2). It may be a bound noun (6.2.3) or a bound stem such as
demonstrative, indefinite, and interrogative modifiers (6.2.4.1), numerals
and quantifiers (6.2.4.2) or a(:)- ‘thematic’ to form connectives (6.2.4.3).
What precedes a classifier may be a nonfinite verb which, with the clas­
sifier, forms a derived noun, e.g., ‘doctor’ from ‘treat’ (6.2.5). Classifiers
may head relative clauses (6.2.6) or perhaps, in the case o f -ne (0), function like a subordinator (6.2.7). What precedes the classifier may be a free
possessive pronoun (6.2.8) or a collective or general noun, in which case
the classifier “individuates” it (6.2.9). Classifiers may occur multiple times
in a word (6.2.10). Classifiers may follow -e ‘pertain to’ or -eme ‘similar to’
(6.2.11). And classifiers play a vital referential role in discourse (6.2.12).",[207]
"7.1AppositionThe primary mechanism for combining various nominal words into a noun
phrase is apposition, not— as in most languages— constituency.2 Patterns
like those in 390 are frequent (and in some cases the appositive parts are
discontinuous).
(3 9 0 )a. NPj (© NPj (© NP;...
b. verb-(classifier); (© NP; © NP; ...
The classifiers play an important role in linking the various parts of a
phrase. Consider 391 for example:
(391)Diibye wajpi cdracddfvu ó ajcuube péjucóóhi.
ti-:piè
© kpaxphi © [kharakha-ti-§m
that-(SgM)
man
chicken-anim-thm
ó 0i axkhm ]-:pè;
phé-hmkhó:-?i
I
give
-(SgM) go-now-(t)
‘The man to whom I gave the chicken left.’The first noun phrase, ti-:piè ‘that (SgM)’ is a determiner-based pronoun;
the second, kpaxphi ‘man’ is a noun; and the third, kharakhati§m ó axkhm:pè
‘the one (SgM) to whom I gave the chicken’ is a relative clause. kpaxphi
2By apposition w e mean the use o f tw o or m ore referring expressions, possibly discontinu­
ous, interpreted as having the same referent, but lacking a syntactic relationship. Apposition
depends on an interpretive link in a w a y that constituency does not.",[224]
"©2012 SIL International ®188CHAPTER 6. CLASSIFIERSAnother case is that o f mï-nè transport-(0) ‘canoe’. By itself, the root
mi- does not refer to a canoe; rather, it means quite generally ‘trans­
portation’. However, it does refer to a canoe when combined with -nè
(0), which (1) satisfies the structural requirement for a head, and (2) de­
notes a class o f objects, thus enabling the phrase to refer.12
5. It might be possible to formulate an argument against the claim that
classifiers head their phrases based on the remarkable behavior of clas­
sifiers with numeral phrases.
When a numeral phrase is used to quantify a noun, that noun must agree
in animacy, gender and number. For example, consider 478, page 218.
The phrase that means ‘six’ ends with an animate, singular, masculine
classifier because ‘ six’ is literally ‘one from this hand’. When this phrase
quantifies a noun (phrase), it must agree in animacy, number and gen­
der. Thus, in ‘six dogs’— contrary to what one might expect— ‘dogs’ is
marked as singular and masculine. See section 7.7.2 for further discussion. However, this lends further support for the claim that classifiers
head their phrases. What matters are the features of the the numeral
phrase and the noun, which are precisely the features of the classifiers
with which each ends. That is, the classifiers determine the features of
their phrase, even though these features do not reflect the semantics of
the expression.
To conclude this section (6.3), it should be clear that Bora classifiers
are eminently nominal. Here we have made a stronger claim: that Bora
classifiers are nouns. By doing so, it follows that Bora classifiers should
share the major properties o f nouns: the types o f meanings they encode,
the grammatical functions they may have, their distribution/use, and so
forth. Indeed, they do except that they have a more restricted distribu­
tion than other nouns. And this restricted distribution is due to a simple
property: that they are bound.
Based on the claim that Bora classifiers are nouns, it seems reasonable
to think that what have been called “ classifiers” in Bora are not really
such, but simply a subclass o f nouns. We will not try to resolve this issue
here because the answer depends on whether one believes in universal
category definitions or that ultimately each category must be defined for
each language.","[221, 222]"
"10.2.3Objects as cliticized classifiersWhen a clause has a preverbal subject, the direct object may occur as a
classifier cliticized to the verb, displacing the -(0 0 ?ï (t) that normally
follows when there is a preverbal subject.

(thematic), as when responding to a question about the object. Perhaps
these are not sentences, but relative clauses (in elliptical responses). As
such, the high tone on the first syllable o f each verb marks the clause as
subordinate.","[308, 309]"
"©2012 SIL International ®CHAPTER 8. PRONOUNS234However, in single word responses to questions the vowel is long, as in
530:
(530)a. o:-khè (O ó k e.) ‘To me.’
b. mè:-khè (Meéke.) ‘To us (in.).’8.1.2 The use of personal pronouns
First and second person pronouns are used to refer to the speaker(s) and
hearer(s) as needed. Third person pronouns are used either to “point” to a
referent in the external context or to establish coreference with another
referring expression, usually one that has been previously established.
This latter use o f pronouns competes with two alternatives: (1) with the
anaphor i ‘self’, and (2) with the use of a classifier subject to refer to the
subject. We comment briefly on these in turn.
First, i ‘self’ is an anaphor, so must be bound within a very local domain
(as discussed further in section 8.3) while the personal pronouns must not
be bound within that domain. For example, consider 531, the structure
o f which is represented in figure 8.1. The possessor in the subordinate
clause is ti-:piè (that-(SgM)) and it is bound from outside o f the subordinate
clause. (It could refer to the speaker’s brother or any other male other
than the speaker himself.) If instead it were i ‘self’, as in 1157, page 439,
it would be bound by the subject o f its clause and thus refer to “ me” rather
than to John.4

On the other hand, -teho ‘causative’ after -mei ‘reflexive or passive’
yields only the reflexive interpretation in which the subject is understood
as making the causee do the action to himself; for example:
(260) Oke wahdah+numeichoóbe.

Likewise, -teho ‘causative’ after -xkhatehi ‘reciprocal’ indicates that the
subject causes the referents o f the direct object to do the action indicated
by the verb to each other; for example:

other object) was affected by the verb’s action. The agent of that action
can be understood as the subject himself, that is, “ reflexively,” as in 262a,
or as some other person, that is, “ passively,” as in 262b:
18In exam ple 260 the causative suffix could also be -teko.","[180, 181]"
"The use of qualifier phrases
Qualifier phrases can be used like other noun phrases to refer to persons,
animals, or things. They are not used to introducé a new participant; they
are only used when the context provides a referent. With sufficiënt context
“ one” could be the subject, as in 497:
(497) imia-:péteha:-?i (Im + a ab é t s a a h i.) ‘One who is
proper-(SgM) come-(t )
good comes.’
Or they can be the direct object:
(498 )mitjha-nè max$hó-mè (M fty a n e m ajch óm é.) ‘They ate a lot.’
much-(0) eat-(AnPl)
In most languages an adjective modifies a noun by means o f con­
stituency: [NP Adjective Noun]. However, in Bora adjectives are made
©2012 SIL International ®7.8. ADJECTIVES225into qualifier phrases and the nouns they modify are in apposition. For
example, consider 499 in which kpaxphi ‘man’ is in apposition to imia-:pé
‘good one’:
(4 9 9 ) Im +aabé w ajpi tsaahi.imia-:pé
@ kpaxphi teha:-?i
proper-(SgM)
man
come-(t)‘A good man comes.’And this is the general case: qualifier phrases “modify” by the mecha­
nism o f apposition: QualifierP @ NP. Classifiers play the crucial roles of
(1) heading the qualifier phrase24 and (2) linking them referentially. For
further discussion see section 7.1.","[258, 259]"
"6.2.4.1 Classifiers with demonstrative, indefinite, and interrogative

with (bound) quantifiers like pha- ‘all, completely’, as in 359.
(358) a. teha-?è

The resulting phrase is normally used in apposition to another noun
phrase. For example, in 360 miammnaa ‘people’ is modified by phaa:mai
‘all like sticks in a row’:
(360) M+amunaa juuvayf péé paaamai.
mi ammnaa hm:§a-ji phé:-? pha-a:ma-i
people
path-oblln go-(t) all-(in.row)-(stick)
‘People go on the path in a column, i.e., one behind another.’
Deverbal classifiers (as discussed in 6.1.2) may also be used this way. For
example, in 361 the classifier -ï§ó?o:-m is derived from the verb i§o?o- ‘lie
face down’ by the addition of -m ‘DVC’. This is combined with pha- ‘all’ to
form a noun phrase that is appositive to -mi, the classifier subject on the
main verb:
(361) Teehf uniuri fjcyamt, m++ne pa+vóhoóu.

6.2.4.3Classifiers forming connectives with a(:)- ‘thematic’A classifier may combine with the bound, anaphoric modifier a(:)- ‘the­
matic’ to form a sentential connective. For example, the phrases in 362
refer to a person, animal or thing mentioned in the previous sentence. For
further discussion see section 19.1.
(362) a. a:-$è

thm-(leaf)
d. a:-?è
(a a h e )
‘that tree (plant,...)’
thm-(tree)6.2.5Classifiers with nonfinite verbsA verb is made nonfinite by adding a low tone regressive to the antepenult.
(The nonfinite low tone is indicated by N in the examples below. For
further details about the tonal modification, see figure 4.1, page 100.) A
nonfinite verb may be combined with a classifier to refer to an object (o f
the type indicated by the classifier) associated with the event indicated by
the verb.
The examples of 329, page 165, are like agentive nominalizations. Note
that in 329e -xthe (AnPl) is used with a nonfinite verb, whereas in 346c
above - © ©m e (AnPl) is used (to indicate the subject) following finite
verbs.
In the following examples the classifier refers to an object other than
the subject (agent) o f the nonfinite verb:
(363) kpa:hakhm-?a:mi (w a a ja c u h d a m t) ‘book’
knowing-(leaf)
akhm:§è-kpa
sitting-(slab)(acuuvewa)‘bench’kha:thmnm-i:?jo
writing-(stick)(caatununhyo)‘pencil (pen,....)’©2012 SIL International ®178CHAPTER 6. CLASSIFIERS6.2.6Classifiers as heads of relative clausesA classifier may head a relative clause, either restrictive or nonrestrictive. The initial syllable of the relative clause’s verb bears high tone, as
characteristic o f subordinate clauses. Examples follow:
(364) o ajtyumt teemt fmibajchóóbeke.
ó axtjhmmi-? [thè:-mï

[ó-phéè7 o teixkho ]-ha
tehm:kha noxkhanm-?i
I-rem I sew
-(shelter) already deteriorate-(t)
‘The clothes that I sewed are now deteriorated.’
As with adjective + classifier combinations, relative clauses headed by
a classifier may be appositive to a noun phrase, thereby modifying it; see
example 391, page 190. For further discussion and examples see chapter
18.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"
"6.3.3Classifiers have the distribution typical of nounsMorphologically, classifiers are like nouns in bearing inflection for number and case; e.g., $hémè-mé-?hï-khè (be.ill-(AnPl)-pl-objAn) ‘to the sick
people’.
Functionally, classifiers are like nouns in that they may indicate a sentence’s subject (see 6.2.1), as illustrated with -:phe (SgM), -?e (tree) and
-ha (shelter) in 387:
(387) tha:po-:pè (Taaboóbe.) ‘He treats (medically).’
ai:^iè-?è (Affvyehe.) ‘The tree is burning.’
fmfifc'e-ha (Imffvyeja.) ‘The house (clothes,...) is finished.’
Significantly, preverbal overt subjects do N O T co-occur with classifier
subjects. This is because the classifier IS the subject— not simply an agreement marker.
A subject indicated by a classifier following the verb may be followed
by an overt subject noun phrase, but this is appositive to the classifier
subject:
(388) [predicate*..verb] [subject -classifieri] (( (NPj)
Like nouns, classifiers may head relative clauses; see examples 364-366
and discussion in section 6.2.6.
And, like nouns, classifiers may have adpositional complements as, for
example, English (a ) table like this one. In Bora, this is i-kpa-èmé-kpa ‘a
slab (plank, table, machete,...) like this one’, in which -eme- ‘similar to’ is
a postposition. Compare the structures in figure 6.4:©2012 SIL International ®186CHAPTER 6. CLASSIFIERSlike|Det

In both cases there are two noun phrases. The lower refers to the object
of comparison while the higher refers to the object being likened to it. In
Bora both of these noun phrases are headed by an instance of -kpa (slab).
Finally, as discussed in section 6.3.4, classifiers play a role within noun
phrases typical of nouns, that is, they head the noun phrase.","[219, 220]"
"17.2.1 “Normal” conditional clauses
“ Normal” conditional adverbial clauses are formed with -?ah$hi:(hjm) (hajchnjyu) ‘i f ’. These indicate that the event o f the main clause depends
on that o f the subordinate clause. Sentence finally -?ax$hi:hjm (-h ajch n jyu )
is used, as in 971, and sentence medially -?ax^hi: (-h a jc h n ) is used, as in
972.2

(contrary-to-fact)’ (CF). Their underlying assumptions are: (1) the truth of
the main clause depends crucially3 on the truth o f the conditional clause,
(2) the conditional clause is false, and (3) therefore the main clause is
false.
The verb of the main clause always bears -i ‘future’ and -ra ~ -ro ‘frus­
trative, contraexpectation’.4 For example:

Note that the order of the main and subordinate clauses is reversed in

expectation) suffixes— negates the future possibility o f the event o f the main clause, thereby
givin g the counterfactual meaning.","[405, 406]"

Aspect (the nature o f the event’s unfolding in time, i.e., whether it is
presented as occurring in an instant, as ongoing, as a persistent state,...)

aspect; see section 5.7.2.

to his beliefs or behavior) is indicated in various ways. Imperatives are
discussed in chapter 14. Interrogatives are discussed in chapter 15.
Evidentiality (i.e., the basis on which one knows the information being
communicated) is indicated by clitics; see section 11.1.
Verbs can be modified by adverbs, which may be verbal suffixes
(5.12.1) or independent words (5.12.2).","[167, 168, 169, 170]"
"6.3.4Classifiers head their phrasesIn Bora the syntax of noun phrase formation is played out intemal to the
word. Indeed, the syntax o f noun phrases extemal to the word amounts to
little more than apposition; see section 7.1 for further discussion.
We claim that—with the exception of classifiers used as (post-verbal)
subjects11— classifiers are the structural heads o f their phrases. Given that
classifiers are nouns, what is projected from them is a noun phrase. What
precedes (nonfinite verb, subordinate verb, demonstrative, numeral, quantifier, adjective, and such) is a modifier.
We now present various arguments:
1. The head o f a phrase is what gives the phrase its character. Formally, a
head’s features are shared by the phrase projected from it. For example,
assuming that dog is [+animate] and brown is [+color], the phrase the
brown dog is [+animate] because its head, dog, is [ + animate]. It is
not [+color] because brown is a modifier, not the phrase’s head. (The
phrase very brown is [+color] because its head, brown, is [+color].)
In Bora, kpa:hakhm ‘know’ is a verb having features like [+verbal,
+cognitive], which it shares with its nonfinite form kpa:hakhm ‘knowing’. Suppose this is combined with with -?a:mi (leaf) (paper, book,...),
11It m ight be possible to extend the claim to these cases on an analysis that projects sen­
tences from their inflection, but w e do not pursue that possibility here.",[220]

"Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the indispensible role that various people
have played in making this grammar possible:
The Bora people welcomed the Thiesens into their community; they
taught the Thiesens their language; they collaborated on the preparation
of educational material, on a translation o f the New Testament, and on the
preparation o f a dictionary. The following individuals made particularly
noteworthy contributions: Julia Mibeco N., Eduardo Soria P., and Zacarïas
Mibeco.
Throughout the years o f involvement with the Bora people, Eva Thiesen
constantly supported the work and was an active co-worker. In particular,
she developed the series o f reading instruction materials whereby hundreds o f Bora people learned to read.
The support network of the Instituto Lingüistico de Verano (Summer
Institute o f Linguistics) in Peru: the aviation, radio and computer technicians, the doctors and nurses, the school teachers, the administrators...,
all enabled living and working over a protracted period in an otherwise
challenging environment.
The Ministry of Education of Peru, by granting the Summer Institute of
Linguistics a contract, made research such as that reported here possible.
The backbone o f financial and moral support for this effort has been
provided by Christians who desire that the Bible be translated into “forgotten” languages, even endangered ones like Bora. Without their support
none of this would have happened.
Steve McConnel and members o f the “ (La)TeX for linguists” mailing
list (at ling-tex@ifi.uio.no) provided indispensible help for formatting this
book with TgX, KTgX and finally XjTgX.
Thiesen called his “ tone book.” I f w e assume that there are seven tone marks per w ord (a
conservative estimate), then the tone book has over 20,000 tone marks. A fter exhaustive
study w e have found on ly about a h alf dozen words in which Thiesen may have made an
error.",[26]

Clauses are either main or subordinate. Main clauses are described here.
Subordinate clauses are described in chapters 16-18.
A complete sentence has at least one main clause with a subject and
predicate. The subject may be either a postverbal classifier or it may be
preverbal, in which case the verb is followed by either -?i (-h i) (t) or -ne
(-n e ) (n), as described in section 5.4. A preverbal subject may be a noun
phrase or it may be a proclitic. The tone o f proclitic subjects is discussed
in section 3.12.2, page 93.
The predicate may be a verb or verb phrase, as discussed in sections 5.1,

a. ‘He carried off the thing that he fixed.’
b. ‘After having fixed it, he carried (it) off.’
Both types of -ne are present in mèkha?khmxtehónè mèimipai^éné in figure
16.5; this is a subordinate clause which has a subordinate adverbial clause
within it:7 The adverbial clause bears -ne (event) while the clause in which
it is embedded bears -ne (0). (The tone o f the proclitics is explained in
section 3.12.2, page 93.)
5The distinction corresponds closely to w hat Langacker calls objects and interactions; he
writes (Langacker 1991:183):
Conceptually, objects and interactions present a maxim al contrast, having opposite values for such properties as dom ain o f instantiation (space vs. tim e),
essential constituent (substance vs. energy transfer), and the possibility o f
conceptualizing one independently o f the other (autonomous vs. dependent).
Physical objects and energetic interactions provide the respective prototypes
for the noun and verb categories, w hich likew ise represent a polar opposition
am ong the basic gram m atical classes.
6The crucial syllable is the host’s penult, which must not be the initial syllable because
for both suffixes the host’s initial syllable bears the subordination high tone.
7This example is taken from (Thiesen et aL 1982).",[399]

(t) (5.4.1) or - © ©ne (n) (5.4.2).85.4.1 -hi ~ -h (t)
The morpheme - © © ? (i) (t) is suffixed to the verb o f the main clause, as
in 229:

‘The chief told his people to fix his9 house.’
This suffix occurs only with explicit preverbal subjects, as in 230a. It does
not co-occur with a classifier subject, as in the first alternative in 230b:
(230) a. ï:hm mmï§a-?i (I+ju um+va.) ‘The horse escaped.’
horse escape-(t)
*mmi§a-:pé-?i{I(p f ^ (t) | (Um+vaabe.) ‘He escaped.’escape-(SgM)Nor does it occur in negative clauses; such cases are discussed in the next
section.
The suffix - © © ? (i) (t) imposes a low tone on its host’s penult:
(231) a. ó $e:né-?i (ó lleen éh i) ‘I eat (fruit).’
b. ó i?§èthé-?i (ó th v e té h i) ‘I stop.’
8A theory that entertains some notion o f m ovem ent m ight consider (t) and (n ) to be
“ tracés” o f subjects that have been m oved to a preverbal position. This could be m otivated
by the follo w in g distributional facts: (1 ) (t) and (n ) never co-occur w ith a classifier subject,
presumably because they occupy the position o f classifier subjects, and (2 ) (t) and (n ) occur
i f and on ly i f there is an overt preverbal subject (pronoun, name, or noun phrase).
9This could also refer to “ their” house, i.e., it could be bound by the indirect object rather
than the subject o f the higher clause. The interpretation given in 229 is preferred because
‘house’ is singular. If, how ever, the object w ere plural, that is i ’ Wa ?apè (s e lf house various)
‘his/their various houses’, then the favored interpretation w ou ld be ‘ their houses’ .","[164, 165]"
"6.2.1 Classifiers indicating the subject

the main mechanism for uniting various referring expressions (determiners, modifiers, nouns) into a single phrase; see section 7.1.","[207, 208, 209]"
"7.4.1-coba ‘augment’Suffixed to a noun phrase, -khopa (- c o b a ) ‘augment’ indicates that its refer­
ent is large. The host’s final syllable must bear high tone to avoid violating
the *LLX constraint; see section 3.10.
(456) a. mmé-?é-khopa
(u m é h é c o b a )
‘big tree’
tree- (tree) -aug
b. mmé-?é-khopa-nè (u m é h é c o b a n e ) ‘big trees’
tree- (tree) -aug-pl
Note that -khopa directly follows and modifies the noun phrase referring
to a type of tree. Further note that, in 456b, the pluralizer follows -khopa.
However, -khopa may follow the pluralizer, in which case it enhances the
plurality of the referent:9
(457) a. mmè-?é:-né-khopa (u m e h é é n é c o b a ) ‘many trees’
tree- (tree) -pl-aug
b. kpaxphi:-mm-khopa (w a jp ffm ü c o b a ) ‘many men
men-(AnPl)-aug
(or male animals)’
Note the alternate orders of -khopa ‘augment’ and -mm ‘plAn’ in 458
(where the G over the vowel indicates the genitive low tone):10
(458) a. tha mé:m-kjhopa-mm (ta m é é n ic y o b a m u ) ‘my big pigs’
my pig-aug-plAn
b. tha me:m-mm-khopa (ta m e e n fm u c o b a )
my pig-plAn-aug‘my very many
pigs’9Perhaps the structure o f 456b is [ [ [ mmé-?é ] -k1opa ] -nè] w h ile that o f 457a is
[ [ mmè-?é: ] [ -né-k1opa ] ].
10In 458a -kkopa ‘augment’ is not part o f the stem so the genitive tone © docks on the
m odifier. By contrast, in 458b -mm ‘plAn’ is part o f the stem so © docks on the head’s initial
syllable.",[240]

are burning.’
(221) ai:foé-?a:mi-hi (Anvyéhaam +j+.)
burn-(leaf )-(pl)‘(The books
are burning.)’A preverbal subject noun phrase and a classifier subject are mutually
exclusive, i.e., either one or the other may occur, but not both. We will
call this the PREVERBAL SUBJECT CONSTRAINT.
When the subject is indicated by both a classifier suffixed to the verb
and an overt phrase, then the phrase must follow the verb and is in apposition to the classifier subject. For example, in 222 the verb is followed by
the classifier subject and then a noun (phrase) in apposition to the classi­
fier subject:
(222) T sa ju co ob e oohnbye.
teha-hmkho-:pè
@ oiTi-ip’è
come-now-(SgM)
dog-(SgM)‘The dog already came.’In 223, which might initiate a text, the verb is followed by the classifier
subject and then by a pronominal phrase and a relative clause, both of
which are in apposition to the classifier subject:
(223) Ijc y a a b é e tsa a p i Jóaa im yém e (jcyaabe.
be-(SgM)-rem one-(SgM) John self name
‘There was a man whose name was John.’be-(SgM)From a cross-linguistic perspective it is not unusual to have a postverbal
subject in an “ existential presentative” such as 223. In Bora, aside from
existential presentatives, an overt postverbal subject generally serves to
clarify the identity of the subject in contexts where the classifier is not
sufficiently specific.","[162, 163]"
"4.3.2.1-lle ‘treat like, regard as’The suffix -(OO$G(""He) ‘treat like, regard as’ and -(OOnm ( _nu) ‘cause to
have, do’ derive transitive verbs. With -$e (-lle) ‘regard as’, the referent of
the direct object is compared to the referent o f the host (i.e., the noun to
which
is suffixed). For example, in 158 he (subject) regards me (object)
as a child (host):
(158) oke ts++ménélleébe.
0-khè tehi:méné-^è-:pè
1-objAn child-regard-(SgM)‘He considers me to be
like a child.’17For this reason the Bora dictionary (Thiesen & Thiesen 1998) lists both singular and
m ultiple forms for verbs.
18These m ight be considered noun-incorporating verbs.",[143]
