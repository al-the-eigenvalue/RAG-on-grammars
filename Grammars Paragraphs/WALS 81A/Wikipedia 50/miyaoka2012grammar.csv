Any NP (nominal, nominal phrase, nominalization) can be a sentence by itself:
(60) a. Ciissiq.
A bug.
bug.ABS.sg.
 as in response , e.g. to:
cf. U-na
ca-u-ga?
this-EX.ABS.sg. what-be-INT.3sg.
What is this?
b. Ma-kuciq
ciissiq This kind of bug.  this-kind.ABS.sg.
c. Kegge-ste-ka ciissiq. The bug that bit me.  bite-VNrl-ABS.1sg.sg.
Particles can act as predicates like nauwa (§ 15.2.3.3), in place of the interrogative-mood verb na-nt-a (where-be.at-INT.3sg.) where is it?:
(61)Nauwa
aana-ka?
where
Mo-ABS.1sg.sg.
Where is my mother?A few nominal suffixes in particular, inflected for the absolutive case but not
for person, may give the nominal a predicative force by itself:
VN/NN |-[̙lainaћլ*-| nothing but, lots of, all, only (§ 41.3.3)  possibly related to VV |+*ƾinaћլ-| only, just . Within an appositive nominal phrase, it
has a predicative force:
(62) a. Tua=i nere-rrlainaq.
then
eat-nothing.but.ABS.sg.
Oh my, he/you is/are always eating!
 which may be accompanied by a personal pronoun to specify the
person:
cf. Tua=i nere-rrlainaq
elpet.
then
eat-nothing.but.ABS.sg. 2sg.
Oh my, you (sg.) are always eating!
b. Qai-nga
aug-glainaq
surface-ABS.sg.
blood-NN.ABS.sg.
Its surface is all bloody.
NN |+1paћ-| big (§ 20.1.1):

(䍦tanqig-pag-luni).
when see-IND.1sg.3sg. bright-ITS.ABS.sg. bright-ITS-APP.3Rsg.
I saw it, and (then) it was something very bright.Sentence types 177 the -pak nominal has the verbal force as the parenthesized
cosubordinate -luni form, which is also the case with the following:

 see § 12(3) for u-na this; something noticed and § 53.5-ix for
maaten. The appositive phrase with -pak is quasi-equivalent to:

CAY has a number of devices for reporting what someone has said.
i) Direct quotation: The most direct technique is a direct quotation that uses
a reporting verb with the stem |qanћլ-| to say or pro-verb |pi-| to do together
with what was actually said. Note no shift in person in the following:
(65)Tai-ciq-ua

He said, I will come tomorrow.(66)[Ki-na=llu

[LL]  addressing to fish; § 49 (65a).ii) Reportative enclitic |=ћuћլ| (§ 54.4): This is a very common device for
transmitting a message or information through the speaker as an intermediary,
with:
a. the addressee (listener) as the goal and a third party as the source 
(he, etc.) says/reports that
b. the addressee as the source and a third party as the goal  tell/ask
(him, etc.) that.
The enclitic is attached to the sentence-initial word if the whole sentence is a
matter to be conveyed.
(68) a. Tai-ciq-uq=gguq
unuaqu.
come-FUT-IND.3sg.=RPT tomorrow
(He says) he will come tomorrow.
b. Tai-narq-ua=gguq

(He says) I should come tomorrow.
(69) a. Tai-ciq-ua =gguq

(Tell him/them) I will come tomorrow.
b. Tai-narq-uq=gguq
unuaqu.
come-should-IND.3sg.=RPR tomorrow
(Tell him) he should come tomorrow.
If the third party is indefinite, the enclitic =gguq indicating hearsay it is
said is very frequently used in narratives, usually coming at the end of a sentence-initial word.
See § 54.3 for more illustrations.
iii) Indirect speech with |+ni-|: The third device involves indirect speech by
means of the reportative complex transitive |+ni-| A' say (§ 40.2.4), which, as
stated (§ 5.1.1.3-iii), adds an upper-layer clause (A' says that ), with the information to be delivered by the embedded clause. The embedding |+ni-| functions as an indicator of the evidential status of the sentence. In the following
pair, repeated from (18), the transitive (a) is a report made by the speaker ofConstituent order179another persons arrival (with two arguments), while the detransitivized (b) with
subject coreferentiality is a report of the speakers own arrival:
(70) a. Tai-ciq-ni-a
unuaqu.
come-FUT-A'.say-IND.3sg.3sg. tomorrow
He says she/he (another) will come tomorrow.
b. Tai-ciq-ni-uq
unuaqu.
come-FUT-A'.say-IND.3sg.
tomorrow
He says he (himself) will come tomorrow.
The construction may be periphrastic with the complex verb in an appositional form accompanied by a main clause with the verb |qanћլ-| to say,
|qanћլuc-| to tell (|qanћլ+(u)c-| with EAPL), or the pro-verb |pi-| to do
(§ 51.3.2):
(71) a. Tai-ciq-ni-luni
unuaqu
pi-uq ~ qaner-tuq.
come-FUT-A'.say-APP.3Rsg.
tomorrow say-IND.3sg.
He says he (himself) will come tomorrow.
 the reflexive third person -luni (appositional) being coreferential
with the main clause verb
b. Tai-ciq-ni-luku
unuaqu
pi-uq ~ qaner-tuq.
come-FUT-A'.say-APP.3sg.
tomorrow say-IND.3sg.
He says she/he (another) will come tomorrow.
With an optative verb, the following has a reversed flow of information:
(72)Qanrus-gu,
tai-ciq-ni-lua
tell-OPT.2sg.3sg.
come-FUT-A'.say-APP.1sg.
Tell him I am coming tomorrow.unuaqu.
tomorrowSee also § 5.3.1-vi for indirect questions using the secundative ditransitive
|apѠc-| to ask.
4. Constituent order
CAY morphologically handles within a single word those various syntactical
relationships for which many other (less synthetic) languages employ a number
of separate words. While the internal constituent order of suffixes is very much
restricted, word order in sentences is rather flexible, largely in correlation with
the double-marking system of the language (§ 4.1.4.2) for both:
i) a predicate verb (subject and object number) and its core argument NPs
(case and number)  for the clause level180 Syntactical preliminaries
ii) a head NP (third person/number) and its attributive NP (number)  for the
phrase level.
In the following example:
(73)assik-ai
mikelngu-u-tP
Elitnauriste-mA
teacher-REL.sg.
like-IND.3sg.3pl. child-EV-ABS.pl.
The teacher likes the children. where the syntactic relationship among the verb and two argument NPs is
unambiguous, because of their inflections with double marking, univocally
showing that the subject is the teacher (singular) and the object is the children (plural), and implying that any one of the six possible orders for the three
items involved have no substantial difference, even though the order above is
likely to occur more commonly than others (§ 5.4.1).
By the same token, at the phrase (attributive):
(74)elitnauriste-mG
teacher-REL.sg.mikelngu-i
the teachers children.
child-ABS.3sg.pl. where the relation between the possessor and the possessum is marked in the
two NPs, hence the reversed order of mikelngui elitnauristem bringing about no
difference, though the NP in G function is likely to come first.
Less constrained order is also the case with other nominal phrases than attributive  appositive, coordinate (apart from the conjunctive enclitic),
adjunctional  except for the strongly bound juxtaposed phrases (§ 5.1.2-3,
§ 14.3.3 [numerals], § 16.3).
Subordinate or cosubordinate clauses do not show any discrepancy from
main clauses in terms of constituent order.
Little evidence exists that the heaviness of an argument NP or a predicate
may affect the word order.
However, word order either within clauses or nominal phrases may be pragmatically conditioned  see e.g. § 5.4.4.
No particular quantifier or numeral floating is relevant to CAY.
An enclitic and an enclitic-like particle generally follows the clause-initial
word (i.e. second-position enclitic), except for the coordinate |=Ѥu| and.
See § 15.2 and § 35.2.4 for the position of interrogative words.
4.1. Some tendencies
If, as in the following example, both the subject and the object NP
(elitnauriste-t and mikelngu-u-t) are in the same number (plural), there is no
formal cue to indicate whether either NP is the subject or object, since theConstituent order181absolutive and the relative case have no distinction for non-singular unpossessed nominals (Table 20; § 21). In such a case, the word order comes into
play  (a) is most naturally taken to have the teachers as the subject, and (b)
the children as the subject, suggesting a tendency towards A P V (or S O V):
mikelngu-u-tP
assik-ait
(75) a. Elitnauriste-tA
teacher-REL.pl.
child-EV-ABS.pl. like-IND.3pl.3pl.
The teachers like the children.
b. Mikelngu-u-tA
elitnauriste-tP
assik-ait
child-EV-ABS.pl.
teacher-REL.pl. like-IND.3pl.3pl.
The children like the teachers.
 although P NP may be encountered to stand before A-NP, both in the same
number  see e.g. § 49 (26).
The verb may also come sentence-initially as below:
(76)Apt-ait
ask-IND.3pl.3pl.mikelgu-u-tA
child-EV-REL.pl.angute-tP.
man-ABS.pl. which is commonly understood again to mean the children asked the men,
that is, with the same tendency to place the subject before the object, although
the reverse reading (the men asked the children) may also be possible. Thus it
would not seem easy to decide the canonical or dominant word order of CAY
sentences in terms of the subject, object, and verb, 12 although the language does
show a measurable preference for APS (or SOV) as the unmarked order.
However, the word order may be largely conditioned by discourse/pragmatic
factors instead of syntactic function. An NP in a syntactic case, absolutive and
relative, that works as a discourse topic typically comes at the sentence-initial
position, with a peripheral or demoted argument (in an oblique case) placed
towards the sentence final. See § 5.4.3 for fronting of a peripheral or an oblique
NP that works as a sentence topic.
This is also the case for ditransitive verbs as in the following pair, (a) transitive and (b) intransitive:12. The possibility of finding keys to the matter of basic word ordering may be partly
excluded in CAY by the very fact that the language does not employ stem compounding or noun incorporation as a morphological process, and that its dependentmood (connective) verbs do not seem to reveal a pronounced tendency toward a
certain type of ordering (unlike some languages whose subordinate clauses can reflect unmarked word ordering as the clause tends to be used merely to describe a
fact or to set the scene for the main clause, and is less liable than the latter to word
order variability in terms of, say, topicalization).","[227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"Words, bound phrases, and phrases29of lexical creativity tends to be at the bound phrase level, which produces new
lexical units (except for borrowings) in an innovative and extensive way, which
would possibly be the case with a considerable portion of so-called compounds
in the language. 16
If articulation on the content plane is, as presumed above, a single continuous process in which both the so-called morphology and syntax are intrinsically
one and the same, with the main difference being a matter of a single form vs.
two or more forms (articulus vs. articuli), one might be inclined to think of the
possibility that the two are not autonomous.
3.3. Detached or hetero-articulations
Two or more free words may form a syntactic phrase (or a clause), leading to
the issue of constituent (or word) order. Even though grammatically or semantically related words in languages tend to occur adjacent to each other, we very
often come across instances in which a single phrase of two (or more) words is
split by another syntactically remote word, that is to say, de-articulated. In
CAY where word order is largely free, nominal phrases (e.g. appositive;
§ 16.1), which are typically articulated as bound phrases, as well as relative or
nominal clauses (§ 17, § 18) are easily split by another syntactically remote
word, as in (13), (14), § 20(115), and even word order crossing of two nominal
phrases may occur (§ 27 [115]). Splitting or de-articulation may occur also with
(clitic- or non-clitic) bound phrases. 17
16. Chinese was a polysynthetic language for Vladimir Skaliþka (19091991) who
talked of polysynthesis in reference to compounding (incl. noun incorporation; fn.
4)  1951 Typ polysyntKHWLFN\  7\S þHãWLQ\ Slovanké nakladatelství, Praha (according to Chino Eiichi). Its so-called compounds, however, may perhaps be considered as more or less weakly bound phrases that are easily transferable to
phrases. The more remarkable case of this may be represented by the ionization
(so called since the 1930s) in which compounds (bisyllabic and most frequently
verb + object nominal combinations) in the language are frequently subject to this
form of disjunction or detachment, causing the two words to fill the predicate and
the nominal argument slots of a clause. Cf. Chao 1968: 159160, 426434, etc.,
e.g. ✗曮 (earth-quake) vs. ✗ṭ ᷧ㬈 曮 (earth-ASP one-time quake) there was an
earthquake one time, although the degrees of separation and insertability do possibly vary. By contrast, the Japanese ✗曮 [jisin] is a fixed compound and can never
separate. A more striking instance than this is one provided by Chao (1968, 433),
⹤滀 \ǀXPz humour(ous), a phonetic transliteration (!), which may occur in ẽ ⽯
⹤滀 (he very humor) he is very humorous vs. ㇸ ⹤ ẽ ᷧ滀 (I hu- him one-mor) l
made a joke with (humored) him.
17. Though a typologically rare feature, Cysouw (2005) offers an extensive survey of
pre-posed enclitics in the wrong place, an example of which is also attested in30 A word in Yupik
All these aberrant detached or hetero-articulations could hardly be understood unless the word is merely a form that is not directly or strongly constrained by content (grammatical and semantic). Even though cases such as preposed enclitics may seem unstable, reversal to a functionally explainable order
for them, would not be so easily predicted (if not impossible; cf. Haspelmath
1996: 55). Morphology should be seen to have its own motives largely independent of the content or the function. If the function is a controlling factor,
pre-posing itself would hardly be expected to have come about in the beginning.

"Subject and object persons8711.2. Intransitive vs. transitive
As mentioned (§ 2.1), a stem is a pre-formal unit of content and, as such, has
to be inflected verbally (or nominally) in order to be realized (i.e. articulated) as
a form (articulus) or a word.
i) Whether a stem is primary or extended (modified), and no matter how
many arguments (the level of valency) a stem may have, only one or two arguments can be indexed as core argument(s) in an inflection, thereby forming an
intransitive or transitive verb respectively, as stated above. While intransitive
verbs index one core argument as the subject person in their inflection, transitive verbs have two core arguments as the subject and the object.
A so-called second or indirect object (of ditransitive verbs; § 35) is not
marked inflectionally, as one of the arguments T or R being obligatorily demoted (i.e. CAY has no tri-personal inflection like Basque, for instance). This
means that a tri- or multi-valent stem has to be subject to the argument reduction of one or two arguments, accompanied by obligatory case alternations for
the NPs concerned.
To speak of an intransitive vs. transitive distinction, ditransitives and complex transitives (§ 40) may also be inflected intransitively or transitively, despite the terms. The antipassives (or half-transitives) are intransitively inflected verbs. Note also that, as stated in § 4.2.1-ii, CAY comparative verbs (§ 45)
as well as relational (or equational) verbs (§ 37) may be either transitive or intransitive.
ii) The categories for which verbs are inflected are the person (combined
with number distinction) of core arguments (§ 32.2) and mood (§ 32.4); see
also§ 4.2.4. Morphologically, a mood marker and a person (number) marker
occur in that order, although there is a certain extent of fusion in the composition. Each mood has its own set of inflections as given in Tables 46 through 49.
The indicative and the participial moods, however, share the same set of person
markers (Table 46), though with distinct mood markers.
In CAY, either grammatical gender distinction or noun classification is alien
 hence the conveniently used gloss he/she/it for a third person singular,
above. Alienability is not a grammatical category for the language, either.
2. Subject and object persons
CAY verbs, like nominals, distinguish in inflection among four persons, i.e.
first, second, third, and reflexive third (1, 2, 3, and 3R) each in the singular,
dual, or plural (sg., du., pl.) For verbs, the person refers to the core arguments872 Verb inflection
that syntactically function as the subject (e.g. he arrived) and the object (e.g.
we ate it), whereas for nominals the person refers to possessor (e.g. my/their
house; § 22).
The subject functions as the syntactic pivot, as in reflexivization and (clausal) subordination. The reflexive-third person refers back to the third-person
subject of the main clause, indicating coreferentiality (he
himself), similar
to the possessor of a noun (his own), and also occurs in the connective and
appositional moods (§ 50, § 51) and, marginally, in the participial mood (§ 47).
It is this reflexive third person that distinguishes these three moods from the
other three (§ 32.4).
A verb with plural subject may be used for a singular person out of respect
(cf. § 6.1-ii), though it is interesting to note that this use is used reportedly (according to some consultant) by a male speaker to a male addressee (but not to a
woman or by a woman to a woman [David Chanar, p.c.]):
(3)a. cangac-eci
(something.wrong-INT.2pl.)
how are you (sg.)? for cangac-it? (INT2sg.)
b. pi-ur-ci
(do-CNT-OPT.2pl.)
goodbye! for pi-ura-a (OPT.2sg.)
 the plural forms, with -ra- deletion from pi-urar-ci, may be used
literally for plural persons as well.","[922, 923, 924]"
"96 Morphological preliminaries
1.4.2. Double marking
At the clause level, an absolutive-case NP agrees with the intransitive subject or
the transitive object, and a relative-case NP with the transitive subject, as inflectionally marked. At the phrase level, a relative-case NP is the dependent of an
attributive (genitive) phrase (§ 16.4), agreeing with the third-person possessor
of its head NP (possessum). Thus, both the head and the dependent show double marking at both the clause and the phase level.
Correlated with this double-marking of the basic grammatical relationships,
the constituent order (word order) in clauses and nominal phrases does not play
a central role in the syntax of CAY but is generally very flexible (§ 5.4), and
detached articulation (§ 2.3.3) may be far from a rarity.
The double marking also permits a very high frequency of sentences consisting of only a single (predicate) verb, as a head, with the core argument coded
only in its inflection, thereby yielding practically no ambiguity. By the same
token, attributive constructions may often consist only of the head for the
possessum, with no external NP in G function but with the person (possessor)
marked in the head NP.
CAY belongs to the type of languages where a heavier grammatical weight
is placed on VP than NP(s), though both are intimately correlated.
1.4.3. Case marking
Primary (i.e. non-extended) verb stems have primary arguments, that is, S for
monovalent (intransitive), P and A for bivalent (monotransitive), and T, R, and
A for ditransitive (§ 4.2.1, § 4.2.3.1). S includes impersonal subject (S IMP). Extended (i.e. non-primary or secondary) stems have valency modification, i.e.
increase (and rearrangement) or decrease, as derivational process. Increase includes causative A (only on monovalent stems or roots, § 4.2.2-iv), applicative
and adversative E (standing for extension of experiencer E; E APL and EADV,
§ 39.4, § 39.4), impersonal agent (A IMP), and complex transitive agent A', A"",
Decrease includes antipassive and pseudo-passive. See § 30.1.2 for the list of
primary and extended arguments.
All these arguments are candidates for core arguments. These, with various
combinations occurring in a single verb, are subject to case-marking, if externally expressed by a free NP (except S IMP and AIMP which can never be explicit,
thus irrelevant to case marking, though they are coded as intransitive or transitive subject in verb inflection). A single verb is actually attested to have up to
six or seven arguments involved (though theoretically with no upper limit).
Every one of the arguments may be promoted to the absolutive-case status and
all, except for P argument, may occur in the relative-case status. Corresponding-Word and its constructions97ly, all of them can also be subject to argument reduction (by way of demotion, deletion, and coreference; § 30.3). Given all this, no static case alignment
pattern may be feasible in CAY, but a dynamic process of case assignment
should be considered that rigidly follows argument hierarchy in § 30.2 (where
the whole pattern of case assignment is summarized).
The language has no active-inactive [active-stative] split (Sapir 1917,
Klimov 1974) in its case marking, that is: there is no split intransitivity, 7 although the active verbs are only relevant to one kind of relativizer (§ 17.5.1)
and imperatives in the optative mood (§ 49). S A argument only pertains to the
agentive/active relativizer |+st-| one who (§ 17.5).
An adjunct NP is assigned one of the five oblique cases  ablative-modalis,
allative, locative, perlative, or equalis  aside from a vocative form (§ 31). Details of the seven cases and their assignments are provided in § 23 through § 29.
Chapter 30 of case assignments is at the midpoint of the whole description
where many things from the previous nominal chapters (e.g. nominal derivation
and inflection) get explained and looks ahead to issues that will be handled in
the following verb chapters (e.g. verb valency and inflection), as their integrative treatment.
2. Word and its constructions
As stated in connection with non-templatic polysynthesis (§ 4.1.3), a CAY word
as defined in § 2 can easily be seen as an functional equivalent of a sentence
with a complex syntactic structure at one extreme, while at the other extreme it
may be coterminous with a single morpheme (as is in typical isolating languages). CAY words as such are structurally diverse, functionally versatile, and
deviate considerably from the common view of words that is based on wellknown European languages.
Accordingly, a CAY word may be a very long sequence of syllables. However long it may be, a CAY word is a form that is characteristically patterned by
certain morphological features and underscored by phonological ones that include (basically iambic) accentuation, a (potential) intonation contour, and,
most fundamentally, potential pausing. These two conspire to unify a word as
a form (§ 2.2.2).
Yupik words are in fact not merely static constructs but may approach the
dynamism of a sentence in a microcosm, as speakers creatively articulate a
word, to a considerable extent, on each occasion or on the spur of the moment.
A word can be made up, though necessarily within certain limitations, by using

Adnominal clauses (verbs)  appositional and stative-connective ..... 483A nominal phrase, consisting of two or more constituents (nominals) and filling
a syntactic slot just like a single nominal, is internally either appositive
(§ 16.1), 1 coordinate (§ 16.2), juxtaposed (§ 16.3), attributive (genitive;
§ 16.4), or adjunctional (§ 16.5). Finally added here is a non-restrictive adnominal clause (§ 16.6), a clause characterized by an appositional (§ 51) or a
stative-connective (§ 50.10) mood, which semantically modifies an NP or a
noun-stem. This is distinct from a (restrictive) relative clause as a nominalization (§ 17).
The two (or more) nominals concerned are typically, though not necessarily,
contiguous, occurring next to each other. They are usually pronounced as a
single articulus  as a weakly bound phrase  but with possible permutation, i.e.
internal free word order. Attributive phrases tend to have the dependent NP (in
G function) preceding the head, though the reverse order by permutation is still
possible. An exception is a juxtaposed phrasal numerals (§ 14.3.3), which are
strongly bound and basically have fixed word order with no permutation or
insertion.
Except for a juxtaposed phrase (because of the nature, § 16.5), a nominal
phrase may have one or two nominal phrases embedded, which in turn may
have another phrase embedded (thus three-layered). Different combinations are
attested below, where the double greater than sign 䍿means which embeds:
i. appositive phrase:1.䍿attributive phrase (11), (13b), (16), (19), (23), (32)

"If angute-m ever occurs, the word order does not matter, and as a statement, no
marked prosodic prominence is necessarily given to any word.
In the following example also, (a) typically occurs without the agent NP
angute-m the man, but it likely shows up if with an anaphoric (demonstrative)
specification and/or some adjunct in apposition like in (b):

Likewise, the transitive object (him/her) is not explicit with a free NP in
(80a). In (b) it shows up with the demonstrative and the relative clause as the
sentence-final phrase, though more as supplementary information rather than the
topic (with the anaphoric im-na particularly emphasizing shared knowledge):

Where shall I find that man who is tall?
Despite the relatively low functional load of word order, there are certain
constructions that may tend to, or even have to, occur in certain more or less
fixed orders. This includes rigid order of juxtaposed-phrasal numerals
(§ 14.3.3), interrogative words that typically occur in the sentence-initial position (though also in the second position; § 48.2.3), the pro-word |+pi-| in periphrastic constructions  optative verbs (§ 49.4.2), complex verbs (§ 40.6.1) 
after the other, i.e. cosubordinate word, and so on.
See Woodbury (1987b: 191192) for elucidations as to particle-related ordering.
4.2. Detached constructions
Although items belonging to a constituent show a strong tendency to be adjacent, discontinuation or detached articulation (§ 2.3.3) is far from rare, correlated with a low rigidness in word order that is largely supported by double marking.
NPs constituting a nominal phrase (§ 16) or a relative clause, for instance,
are typically contiguous, but they easily can be interrupted by another word,
say, a predicative as in the example § 17(36). See also § 27(115) for a particularly interesting instance of word order crossing across two nominal phrases,
schematically, of {A B}{C D} into {A C B D}.
4.3. Disambiguation
Word order, however, may often be relevant or even crucial in avoiding possible ambiguities in different types of constructions  clausal and phrasal.
In the following pair of sentences the dual demonstrative tau-ku-k those is
ambiguous, i.e. either in the absolutive or the relative case, as is the case with
the indicative verb anglica-llini-ak with either the transitive inflection of -ak,
i.e. either 3du.3sg. or 3sg.3du., when it occurs after stem-final CV (see § 46.1).
The different position of the demonstrative, however, should disambiguate as
the translations provided:184 Syntactical preliminaries

Oh, (I see that) he raised them two as if they were her/his (own two)
children.
In attributive phrases the dependent is more apt to precede the head (as stated), but sentences such as the following (a) are ambiguous with regard to
whether the relative-case NP arna-m is in G or A function, while (b), with atr-a
placed after the verb, is more likely to have the reading a-ii):
(82) a. Arna-m
atr-a
assik-aa
woman-REL.sg. name-ABS.3sg.sg.
like-IND.3sg.3sg.
i. He likes the womans name.
 with arna-mG constituting an attributive phrase with its head NP atr-a
ii. The woman likes his name.
 with arna-mA as the subject of the transitive assik-aa.
b. Arna-mA
assik-aa
atr-aP.
The woman likes his name.
Ambiguity also arises with appositional-mood verbs as to whether they are
subordinate to a main clause predicate or belong to an embedded clause:
(83)Cuka-luni
yuarut-mek
atu-ner-mek
elit-uq.
fast-APP.3Rsg. song-ABM.sg. sing-VNnm-ABM.sg. learn-IND.3sg.

He is learning fast how to sing a song.
b. [Cuka-luni
yuarut-mek
atu-ner-mek](P)
elit-uq.
He is learning how to sing a song fast.The ambiguity is avoided if the appositional verb follows the main clause predicate:
(84)[Yuarut-mek atu-ner-mek] elit-uq cuka-luni (䍦cukamek PCL).
He is learning fast how to sing a song.Constituent order185(Potential) pauses often play an important role in disambiguating otherwise
identical utterances in a variety of cases. The relevance of pauses in semantic
interpretations will be mentioned in sections where it is relevant.
4.4. Fronting
i) In actual utterances, any part of a sentence including a peripheral can be
fronted as a sentence topic, optionally accompanied by the reactive/responding
enclitic |=wa| (or non-enclitic _ wa| in some coastal areas; § 54.1-i), forming a
single bound phrase characterized by marked prominence  greater stress and
length, falling tone, but, most significantly, a pause. For instance, back to (78)
the man killed the bear:
(85) a. Árna-m,

"3.1. Suffix orders
Since the scope of a derivational suffix is, in general, the immediately preceding
portion (either the stem, the suffix, or the whole) of the word, different suffix
orders inside a complex transitive verb yield semantic and (internal-)syntactic
relationships.
Between two VVcm suffixes  cf. § 40.3.2:
(116) a. naulluu-vkar-ni-luku

"The relative word order between the possessor nominal, i.e. Mayam, and the
possessum, i.e. pania, is not relevant, though the former may tend to precede
the latter, that is, A+N type.
Whichever word order it may take, (7) can have another reading, however,
due to the two functions of the relative case (A and G; § 24.1 and § 24.2). The
relative-case Mayam in G function in (7) can also be in A function for a transitive construction as in the following, that is, an explicit NP for (6):

"Word and its constructions121Denominal verb derivation may share certain characteristics with noun incorporation (e.g. some extent of lexicalization, nominal elements as non-core
arguments, etc.), though CAY denominal verbs are not viewed as incorporation
in this grammar.
The denominal verbs derived with NV suffixes are monovalent (with S argument  [51]) or bivalent (with P and A arguments  [52]), the more common
of which include:
(51) a. to be/become   (stative/inchoative relational verb)
b. to be at (locative verb), to be far in direction, to go to
to have,to have plenty of, to catch a lot of; to lack/have no, to
deprive of, to de-, to make, to supply (with), to have a good, to
be a bad/unpleasant, to eat, to hunt, to go and get, to be affected/hurt in [body part], etc.
(52) a. to be/become someones  / to (now) have  as (stative and inchoative relational verbs), cf. (51a) above
b. to make/build for, to supply  with.
The (a) and (b) group are described in separate chapters § 37 and § 38. The
former, i.e. relational verbs (a), are very productive in many ways, both synchronically and diachronically, and will turn out to be the warp and weft of the
grammatical texture unique to CAY. Later chapters will clarify how important a
part relational verbs play in CAY grammar.
iv) Verb-elaborating suffixes (VV; § 39, § 40; § 41 through § 45)  modify a
preceding verb stem to form a verbally expanded stem, without converting the
word class. They are functionally most versatile and make up two groups in
terms of valency modification.
One group is responsible for valency modification  increase, decrease, and
rearrangement of arguments  within simplex verbs (VVsm; § 39  e.g. causative, applicative, adversative, etc.) and for producing complex transitive
(VVcm; § 40  directive, speculative, causative, ignorative, etc.), which embeds
a simplex verb into a (possibly recursive) upper-layered clause with its own
agent argument (A') added.
The other group involves no valency modification, but only concerns verbal
categories (VV; TAM, polarity, evidenciality, etc.), adverbial modifiers (of
manner, degree, location, time, etc.), and same-subject secondary verbs (e.g. to
wish to, pretend to, be tired of ing, etc.).
Besides these major types, there are a few specific types of suffixes:
v) (Dis)honorific suffixes  include a fair number of NNh/VVh suffixes that
express an attitude/evaluation (e.g. affectionate, pejorative) of the speaker to-122 Morphological preliminaries
wards the person(s) or thing(s) concerned as the subject argument (S/A). One
and the same suffix works either NN or VV, but is conveniently illustrated in
§ 20.2 as NNh. Some suffixes of this type in particular have the peculiarity that
they are typically nomadic, floating among nominals or verbs, and others may
stand after particles or (inflected) personal pronouns and particles, reminding us
of postinflectional derivation (§ 4.1.3.2). 17
vi) Particle related suffixes  there are a small number of suffixes  cf.
§ 5.1.3.2  that may:
(53) a. be added to particles  relational verb NVrv |+ƾu-| to be N, linker
EX |+(V/VV)ћլ-| to utter/say, VVa |+1paћ-| to say loudly, possibly
after particles as in § 41.3.2(111)
b. be added to ignorative words and particles  intensifying VVa
|-qapic-| ~ |-qapia(ћլa)ћլ-| (§ 41.3.1)
c. particlize verb stems  exclamative VPc |+1paa| (§ 52.4.1)
2.5.2. Suffix order
The considerable flexibility of word order within a sentence contrasts with the
relatively rigid suffix order within a word, which is, in general, determined semantically, grammatically, and/or pragmatically. A suffix may have semantic
and/or syntactic scope over the immediately preceding suffix or an expanded
stem as a whole. Due to semantic or grammatical constraints, two suffixes may
occur in opposite positions, generally with some difference.
Variously contrastive orders may be illustrated with two or three VV suffixes, each with different scopes, one of which is the reportative complex transitive
VVcm |+ni-| A' to say (§ 40.2.4):
(54) a. pissur-ciq-ni-a
hunt-FUT-A'.say-IND.3sg.3sg.
b. pissur-ni-ciq-aa
hunt-A'.say-FUT-IND.3sg.3sg.she said he would go hunting
she will say he has gone hunting17. The floating of attitudinal or evaluative suffixes is attested among some neighboring languages, like Koryaks argument-modifying type of diminutive/augmentative suffixes, which contrastively show the ergative pattern of S/P (M. Kurebito
2000). She remarks, in regard to the argument being referenced, that the Aleut suffixes (based on Bergsland 1997) behave neutrally in both between those of
Koryak/Chukchi and of Central Alaskan Yupik Eskimo (154).","[172, 173, 174]"
"Part 6
VerbsMorphological constitution of CAY verbs is the same as for nominals, that is,
they consist of one stem, derivational suffix(es), and an inflection (or an ending), occurring in that order. It is a verbal inflection that completes a verb
morphologically. Since no derivational suffix is obligatory (unlike the stem
and the inflection), a stem can be closed directly by an inflection. Some stems
may consist of a root and a root expander (EX), a kind of derivational suffix.
A root alone cannot be directly followed by an inflection.
A verb inflection is a combination (occasionally fused) of two inflectional
suffixes coding its obligatory grammatical categories  person (for both subject and object) and mood, as opposed to nominals with case, number, and
person (possessor). Inflected verbs are either intransitive with the subject
marked or transitive with both the subject and object marked. Tense, aspect,
modality, negation, and evidentiality belong to derivational morphology.
Verb-related derivational suffixes, which may optionally occur, have a
very wide range of functions. They are responsible for:
i. adverbial modification (VVa; § 41)
ii. grammatical modification tense and aspect (VVt; § 42), modality
(VVm; § 43), evidentiality (VVe; § 43.2), negation (VVn; § 44), and
comparison, § 45)
iii. valency modification (VVsm, VVcm; § 39, § 40)
iv. verbalization (NVrv, NV; § 37, § 38)
v. nominalization (VNrl, VNnm, VV; § 17, § 18, § 19).","[915, 916, 917]"

similarity, i.e. kingunermitun ayuqelriamun, and the attributive phrase, i.e.

which are typically characterized by a sentence-final (highest) tone rapidly falling, displaying the same intonation as declarative sentences. While binary questions are characterized by the rhetorical question | qaa| (is that right?  sentence adverbial, § 53.2) and no interrogative-mood verb, content questions
obligatorily contain an interrogative word (§ 15.2) and a verb that is generally
in the interrogative mood (this chapter). Content questions are also possible
with verbs in other moods than the interrogative  the participial (§ 47), optative
(§ 49), and appositional (§ 51).
1. Inflection
The inflection for interrogative verbs consists of a mood marker followed by a
subject person marker (intransitive), or a subject-object marker (transitive). As
with the optative, the mood marker has different variants depending upon the
subject person, i.e. |+1ta-| (postconsonantal) ~ |+ћa-| (postvocalic) for the third
person and |+1ci-| for the first and the second person, as indicated by the shaded
portions in Table 47.
The third person marker is illustrated, with an interrogative word implied

"2.5.5.2 Splitting with expletive |pi-|  periphrastic constructions
More systematic and extensive than the preceding lexical periphrasis, synthetic
verbs (certain denominal verbs and expanded verb with VV suffixes) may be
rendered periphrasically by splitting them into two independent words, with the
use of the expletive and ambivalent pro stem |pi-| thing; to do (§ 10.3.1, etc.),
thereby serving discourse functions in particular (spotlighting, shading off, indirectness, etc.).
i) Nominal splitting: A synthetic denominal verb (N + NV) may be split into
a full NP and a |pi-| verb. The suffix requires a prop |pi-| in order to reset a
word, while the discharged 㔥⇡ 18 or stranded noun is inflected with the ablative-modalis (§ 25.2.2).
In the following example, (a) is a denominal verb (intransitive) with an S argument, while (b) has the nominal stem qayar-pa(g)- big kayak stranded into
an ablative-modalis NP, with the prop verb used to reset the rest of the original
verb -ngqer-tuq. Splitting as in (b) may yield room for focusing the big kayak.
Either word order is possible, with some pragmatic difference.
(93) a. qayar-pa-ngqer-tuq
kayak-big-have-IND.3sg.
b. qayar-pag-mek(P)
pi-ngqer-tuq ~ pi-ngqer-tuq qayar-pag-mek
kayak-big-ABM.sg. PI-have-IND.3sg.
he [S] has a big kayak.
In addition, a synthetic nominal with the particular NN suffix |-lћ-| one having (§ 20.1.2) may also be split with nominal prop |pi-|:18. This is employed as a contrary process of incorporation in its wide sense. The
term 㔥⇡ itself was once suggested, with utmost caution, by Rokuro Kono as regards the nature of Japanese verbs and verbal complexes (§ 2.3.2) in Kamei et
al. (1989: 15801582, 1996: 1298).",[188]
"All the clauses illustrated with |qaa| are in the indictive verb, but an optiave one

"General characteristics851.1. Predominant suffixation
CAY is endowed with a great quantity and variety of highly productive suffixes
that provide supple means for the complex inflection and derivation of both
verbs and nominals other than non-inflecting words (§ 52 through § 54).
A CAY inflecting word  verb or nominal  is made up of a single stem that
can optionally be followed by a potentially long series of derivational suffixes
(or postbases called by some Eskimo linguists), which are in turn obligatorily
followed by final inflection (or ending by some), as schematized:
(1)STEM1 + DERIVATIONAL SUFFIX0~ + INFLECTIONAL SUFFIX1-3
(i.e. INFLECTION1)where the superscript 1 for the word-initial stem implies a single stem, namely,
that there is no stem compounding (below) nor prefixation (with the caveat in
§ 4.3-i), the 0~ for derivational suffixes means a zero or (theoretically) an indefinitely large number of them, that is, they are optional, and the 1-3 for inflectional
suffixes consist of one, two, or three (depending upon the kinds of words; superscript for inflection). These are frequently fused and are called an inflection,
being generally given as a single unit without analysis in representations. While
derivational suffixes are optional, a stem and an inflection (with superscript 1)
are obligatory.
A stem, followed by derivational suffixes (§ 4.2.5), is called an expanded
stem.
Even though the following example has suffixes which are concrete in content, it is a single and completed word, i.e. a (derived or denominal) verb as a
minimum form or articulus:
(2)qayar-pa-ngqer-tuq
kayak-big-have-IND.3sg.he has a big kayakwhich consists of one stem qayar- and one inflection -tuq, with two derivational
suffixes -pa-ngqer- intervening. The qayar-pa- as well as qayar-pa-ngqer- are
expanded stems. But deprived of the stem and/or the inflection, the remaining
portion can never be a word, so that there cannot be any such forms in CAY
as *pa-ngqer-tuq (devoid of a stem) and *qayar-pa-ngqer (devoid of an inflection).
More complex examples are shown by the following (a) nominal (nominalization; § 18) and (b) verb (complex verb; § 40):
(3)a. qayar-pa-li-yara-qa
kayak-big-make-VNnm-ABS.1sg.sg.
the way I make a big kayak86 Morphological preliminaries
b. qayar-pa-li-qa-a-sqe-ssaaqe-llru-aqa.
kayak-big-make-POL-EV-A'.ask-but-PST-IND.1sg.3sg.
I asked him to make a big kayak (but actually he has not made it yet)
 both of which will be shown with more detailed analysis respectively in (1) and (10).
Derivation and inflection cover a wide range of grammatical and semantic/pragmatic functions. In CAY the distinction between inflection and derivation is clear-cut (though with very slight blurring)  the final -qa in (a) and -aqa
in (b) are inflections.
Inflection, as an obligatory constituent for inflecting words, is paradigmatic,
while the derivation of optional constituents is syntagmatic. The inflection
completes a word morphologically, i.e. as a minimal form or articulus. The derivation that optionally occurs between a stem and an inflection is both lexical
and grammatical, though the demarcation is not so clear. This takes the place of
many syntactic, i.e. word-external, operations made in other languages, including relative clauses and nominalizations (§ 17 and § 18), etc.
i) Morphological homogenity: Most of the important grammatical strategies
in CAY (or any Eskimo language for that matter) rely very much upon the morphological process of suffixation to the almost complete exclusion of other processes, a remarkable contrast with many languages in the world that use two or
more mixtures of morphological processes side by side. Other processes than
suffixation are very much limited, only including, to a very small extent, reduplication, suppletion, and a few other anomalies, some of which may be arguable (§ 4.3).
Stem compounding (either N+V, V+N, N+N, or V+V) is entirely alien to the
language, apart from a few kinds of phrasal compounds (§ 4.3-v) which are
single words. As a corollary, the language is completely free of incorporation as
a morphological process (as a kind of N+V or V+N type compounding) of the
Sapir-Mithun tradition (§ 2.1-i), which is an important process in many socalled polysynthetic languages (including Ainu and Chukchi-Koryak languages
in northeastern Asia and numerous Native American languages). Suffixation is
thus fully or resourcefully exploited by the language, producing incomparably
intricate words rich in functional diversity.
ii) Pure and simple suffixes: Many derivational suffixes appear to be lexical
with a concreteness of content that would characterize stems or roots in many
other languages. They are highly productive in creating new lexical items.
However, CAY suffixes are clearly distinct from the so-called lexical or
nominal suffixes of the controversial Mosan languages (Sapir 1929)  Salish, Wakashan, and Chimakuan  in the Northwest Coast, which are commonly
counted as polysynthetic. They too may express content such as he is huntingGeneral characteristics87rabbits in a single word with the same constituent order of stem-derivationinflection. But the fundamental difference between GCAY and those languages
may be illustrated with a regular process of forming words schematically, to
follow Matthews (1997: 173), along the lines of:
GCAY:
Mosan:rabbit-hunt-IND.3sg.
hunt-rabbit-PRG.3sg.vs.with the nominal element rabbit (underlined) is the stem in GCAY but is the
derivational suffix in Mosan where it is literally a nominal suffix. The verb
to hunt is a derivational suffix in the former, but is a stem in the latter. Despite
the difference, the words in either languages are far from a fixed or ready-made
unit established prior to a speaker and stored as a single concept (§ 2.2).
While most derivational suffixes are highly lexical or concrete in terms of
content, some of the stem-elaborating suffixes (§ 4.2.5.1) may merely add an
associative elaboration or slight modification on the content of the stem, and
what is added may not be clearly differentiated and thus hard to conceptualize.
Rather than distinctly modifying or subcategorizing what is denoted by the
stem, those suffixes may have a general, diffuse or elusive meaning or may be
just an expression of a speakers some psychological or mental attitude toward
it or an emotional reaction  cf. Mithun (1998).
iii) CAY suffixes, either derivational or inflectional, are pure and simple (or
canonical) suffixes in the sense that they are etymologically unrelated to any
stems in the language with which they may seem logically connected and that
none of them are all grammaticalizations of free (independent) or bound words. 1
The language has no explicit evidence either of enclitics having come from free
words or of suffixes from enclitics. None of the person suffixes for nominals
(marking possessors), for instance, are either enclitics or reduced forms of (synchronic) free pronouns, as is also the case with verbal persons (for subject and
object), though, historically, some of Eskimo inflectional suffixes seem to have

adjunct unuk, cakneq), since any core arguments are indexed in the verb inflection as pronominal subject or object. See § 23.2 for peripheral function of unuk
in the absolutive case.
Pragmatically, a core argument NP such as angute-m, angun, atsa-t in a syntactic case generally carries old information and as a discourse topic it may

"The focus Nukaq for the question by ki-na may stand word-initially or not.
Ignorative words in content questions may either be a particle (how), an inflected adverbial adjunct (why, when, where), or a core or demoted argument (what, who[m], which). Not only intransitive S and monotransitive P
and A, but any ditransitive T, R, or A can be questioned by an ignorative word
and the interrogative-mood verb (as illustrated in § 48.2)  cf. § 35.2.4 for ques-168 Syntactical preliminaries
tions of ditransitive verbs. Content questions are more fully illustrated with
ignorative words (§ 15.2) and interrogative mood verbs (§ 48.2).
Verbs of other moods than the interrogative, however, may also be used to
form content questions, see, e.g. § 47.2 for a participial-mood verb particularly
with the particle |ima| you know.
ii) Polar questions: A polar question, in contrast with the content question
just above, does not occur with an interrogative-mood verb and is characterized
by the rhetorical question particle |qaa| (§ 53.2; instead of an ignorative word). 9
This |qaa| as a particle may occur independently as a free word meaning (is

nevertheless forming a non-HQFOLWLF ERXQG SKUDVH DV LQGLFDWHG E\  EHORZ

"1.4. Ergativity and case-marking
A predicate verb (§ 5.1.1) in CAY marks only one or two core arguments (subject and object), hence an intransitive or transitive verb, whether externally expressed by NPs or not: An NP or noun phrase as an argument may be a single
nominal, a nominal phrase  including appositive, coordinate, juxtaposed,
adjunctional as well as attributive or genitive (§ 16)  or a nominalization, that
is: a nominal or relative clause (§ 17, § 18). In CAY the basic grammatical relations in phrase and clause level are marked both in the head and its dependent
with its own inflection, hence the double-marking system (below). Cases for
nominals are one of the inflectional, i.e. obligatory, categories to be marked
(§ 4.2.4).
Eskimo languages are well known for being ergative languages in terms of
morphology. This ergativity, however, manifests itself in a few other aspects.",[145]

"88 Morphological preliminaries
cognates in Aleut as Bergsland has argued (1951, etc.). That is, CAY is a language for which suffixes, clitics, and free-standing words are clearly distinct
(even though free words may very often be articulated as part of bound phrases;
§ 2.3).
There are a fair number of suffixes, however, which are composed of two or
more suffixes to be more or less fixed markers for grammatical categories  see
4.1.3.1-ii for composite suffixes.
iv) Although the predominant morphological process is suffixation, there a
few morphological anomalies (prefixation, root increment, suppletion, reduplication, and phrasal compounds) specific to certain morphemes (§ 4.3-i through
v) as well as symbolistic (Sapir 1921: 133134, etc.) processes which have
grammatical significance, i.e. prosodic (disturbances of the regular pattern; consonant gemination, vowel doubling) and phonemic (phonetic symbolism by
vowel height). Woodbury (1981b) supplies a fair amount of information of
symbolic processes from the Chevak dialect (HBC).
1.2. Agglutination
CAY is an agglutinative language in that:
i) Morphemes within a word have a mechanical cohesiveness, with more or
less transparent or clear-cut boundaries (segmentability)  as in (4a) below. To a
very limited extent, however, segmental adjustments at morpheme boundaries
may have blurred morpheme division due to a certain amount of fusion (§ 7).
This is more often the case within inflections (consisting of not more than three
word-final morphemes  out of case, number, person, and mood), thus no morpheme-for-morpheme division generally given in interlinear glosses for inflections. Different degrees of cohesiveness may be shown by example (4), starting
from a) clear-cut segmentability to b) partial fusion (between possessor and
possessum numbers) and c) complete fusion (of three morphemes):
(4)a. angya-ge-m-ni du.-1sg.-LOC
in my two boats  |aƾ\Dћլ-| boat
b. angya-a-ni
3sg.sg.-LOC
in his boat
angya-m-ni
1sg.sg./pl.-LOC in my boat/boats
c. angya-a
ABS.3sg.sg.
his boat.ii) There exists a high degree of one-to-one correspondence between expression and content since morphemes are generally isomorphic or monofunctionalGeneral characteristics89(with a few exceptions)  as plural marker |+t-| (with no variants) in both
nominals and verbs. 2
Suppletive variants, both in derivational and inflectional suffixes, constitute
just a handful of exceptions (§ 4.3-iii).
iii) Except for a very limited amount of peculiarity specific to certain suffixes as well as some inflectional fusion, the CAY phonology or the segmental
adjustments as given in § 7 is fairly regular, even though deeply layered (ordered) in many instances.
1.3. Non-templatic polysynthesis
As stated, CAY, like other Eskimo languages, has a remarkably high degree of
synthesis owing to the availability, and recursive occurrence, of a great number
of highly productive derivational suffixes (including transcategorial ones). These occur in sequence with semantic compatibility, with possible different suffix
orderings as a reflection of different scopes. The flow of a word is thus characterized by a method of pruning afterthoughts (Sapir 1921: 135, fn. 10). The
remarkably high degree of polysynthesis, as will be amply illustrated (§ 4.2.5.3
and § 4.2.5.4), is obviously attained by the non-templatic nature of its derivational suffixation (Mithun 1999: 43).
In this respect, CAY polysynthesis is remarkably contrasted with many other
polysyntetic languages of the North Pacific Rim. The language, for instance,
flatly precludes a slot-and-filler template analysis as first employed by Sapir
and Hoijer (1967) for Athabaskan verbs, in which a good number of rigid preroot slots (or morphological positions) and a few post-root ones are paradigmatically filled. In contrast, CAY suffixation is semantically conditioned in
general, with a suffix having its immediately preceding morpheme (or sequence) as its scope, and it is semantic compatibility rather than position class
that is the guiding structural principle, with the result that different suffix orders
are possible. Even in Eskimo languages, however, it is necessary to

"The highest number possible with native numerals (by multiplication),

common than the opposite (the permutated malru-k yuin-a-k and others are also

"Connective mood1385A comparison of Table 49 with Table 22 (§ 24) will show that the intransitive connective-mood markers are exactly identical with the relative-case inflections for possessed nouns  the shaded portions in both the Tables. 1
Considered to be a connective mood here for morphological reasons, the
stative-connective (§ 50.10  or independent relative below) is functionally
closer to an appositional verb (§ 51) with its function of adnominal verbs.
(§ 16.6, § 51.5).
The relative order of a connective-mood clause and its main clause is not
fixed. It may stand before or after the main clause.
Due to the inflectional distinction between the third and the reflexive third
person, the subject of a connective-mood (adverbial) clause may or may not be
identical to that of the main clause. The object can also be shown to be identical
to the main-clause subject if it is the reflexive third.
In complex sentences with a subordinate clause characterized by a connective-mood verb, the head-clause verb cannot only be in the indicative, participial, interrogative, or optative moods, but also in the appositional mood.
Connective verb clauses may occur independently without the head clause,
which is, pragmatically speaking, most naturally the case. The indirectiveconnective (§ 50.7) has only independent use despite the fact that it is morphologically characterized by the connective person markers.

"Periphrasis with appositionals1473This kind of periphrastic construction with |pi-| has a rigid word order (with

See § 39(33c) which contains six SF, four in the appositional word and two in
pi- verb (participial).
This is in notable contrast to free phrases (of cosubordinate constructions),
like the following, which, unlike a pi- periphrastic construction, allow permutations:

"Particles and enclitics 1503Although an enclitic always forms a part of single articulus (enclitic bound
phrase), it is less subject than a suffix to the cohesive forces inside the articulus.
Suffixes and enclitics have different boundary-signaling features in prosody and
their segmental realizations (§ 8.4).
iii) Enclitics are unanalyzable, i.e. monomophemic and many particles are
also unanalyzable, but many other particles are clearly or apparently derivatives
and allow a greater or lesser degree of analysis (polymorphemic).
Some particles even appear to be petrified remnants of originally inflected
words. Some nominals, still retaining a degree of inflection, may be classed as
particles, though their categorical demarcation may be difficult to make.
iv) An enclitic may be accented, depending upon syllabic sequence of a
whole enclitic bound phrase (§ 8.1), e.g. |=lu| in (2) below, as contrasted with
(1).
v) One enclitic may be followed by another as in (2) below (and further by
another), but they are largely constrained in a relative order, as contracted with
particles, which have more flexibility in this regard.

"146 Syntactical preliminaries
1. Constituents of clauses
A typical CAY clause consists of two cores, i.e. a verb predicate (with its adjuncts) and one or two NPs (core nominal arguments). As the predicate, a VP in
CAY contains a single verb, with obligatory indexing of one or two core arguments in inflection (pronominal arguments), hence an intransitive or a transitive verb (§ 5.1.1). A verb may optionally be accompanied by its adjunct(s)
which include oblique (demoted) arguments, peripherals or adverbials (which
can be nominals, particles, and subordinate clauses), and cosubordinate clauses
(as used by Van Valin 1993).
While one or two core arguments are obligatorily indexed in verb inflections, their external NPs are not obligatory. When external, the NP is marked
with a syntactic case  either absolutive or relative (§ 4.1.4, § 23 and § 24) 
and is cross-referenced with the person in verb inflection, agreeing in number
(obligatory verbal agreement).
A core argument NP, marked with the absolutive or the relative case, can be
a single nominal, a nominal phrase (§ 5.1.2), or a nominalized clause (i.e. relative and nominal; § 17 and § 18), as is also the case for a non-core (demoted)
argument NP marked with the ablative-modalis, allative, or locative case. By
contrast, a peripheral (adverbial) argument NP is marked in one of the five
oblique cases (perlative and equalis besides the preceding three) but not indexed
in the predicate.
Verbal agreement follows the subject-object (nominative-accusative) pattern.
The subject (S or A), the most important grammatical relation, functions as the
syntactic pivot. The subject status is given to the absolutive-case argument of
intransitive verbs and to the relative-case (i.e. ergative-case) argument of transitive verbs. The absolutive-case argument for the latter is the object. The subject
controls reflexivization (with a reflexive pronoun; § 13.1, § 13.2) as well as the
reflexive third person (3R; § 22.2) in possessed nominals and in two nonindependent clauses  subordinate (characterized by the connective mood;
§ 50) and cosubordinate (appositional mood; § 51). A nominal clause, to be
complemented in the main clause, requires demotion of the subject of the original clause into G function (relative case).
Other constituents may include conjunctional, interjective, or vocative elements.
A clause may form a compound or a complex sentence together with another
clause, hence biclausal, or may have another clause morphologically embedded,
forming a complex transitive verb or a comparative clause.","[197, 198]"

"796 Locative case
6. Exclamative
A locative-case NP may commonly be used for an addressee in argument-less
exclamations (§ 5.3.3-i), an exclamative construction that consists of a verb
particlized by the exclamative suffix VPc |+ 1paa| (which does not inflect) and
the enclitic |=li| often attached to the sentence-initial word (§ 54.2-iv). Since
such an exclamative form is morphologically not a verb but a particle (with no
person inflection), the addressee of the exclamation cannot reasonably be expressed by an absolutive-case NP and is instead expressed by an oblique one
(the locative). See § 52.4.1 for more examples with the VPc |+ 1paa|.
The following vocative sentence is from the intransitive construction, which
has an absolutive-case NP as the S argument (the weather):
(62)Akerte-mi=lli
puqlanir-paa! ~ Puqlanir-paa=lli akerte-mi!
sun-LOC.sg.=EXC warm-VPc.EXC
How warm the sun is!
 word order does not matter only if the enclitic |=li| is attached to a
sentence-initial word:
cf. AkertaS
puqlanir-tuq.

Nominal phrase embedding often results in a detached articulation (§ 2.3.3),
as amply illustrated below. See § 27 (115) also for an interesting case of word
order crossing between two nominal phrases as a special type of detached articulation.
A CAY relative clause with its (external) head noun (§ 17.1.1) consists of an
appositive phrase (with external head) with or without an attributive phrase
(with external subject), while a comparative phrase (verbalization of which is a
comparative clause; § 45.4) consists of an appositive phrase (with comparee)
and an attributive (with standard of comparison), and a complement clause consists an attributive phrase (with its logical subject; § 18.1), that is, forming a
possessive construction.
A nominal phrase as a whole cannot be subject to morphological derivation
in CAY. As far as appositive and coordinate phrases are concerned, however,
they may have one constituent (typically a common noun) expanded by a nominal-elaborating suffix NN |-lћ-| one having as in example (74) below, or verbalizing suffixes NV |-ƾT[̙-| / |+WDƾT[̙-| to have, there be, |-ƾ Ѡ-| to get, |+tuћլ-|
to eat, |-li-| to make), with the other constituent being stranded (or left
behind) to the ablative-modalis status (§ 25.2.2).
The case marking of a nominal phrase as a whole is naturally determined by
its function within a clause, where it fills a syntactic slot.
CAY has neither verbal phrases (phrasal verbs), verbal complexes (§ 2.3.2),
nor serial verbs in other languages.
1. Appositive phrases
The two or more nominals that constitute an appositive phrase agree in number
and case, and generally (though not obligatorily) stand next to each other. A464 Nominal phrases
relative clause with external head is an appositive phrase in constitution, e.g.
(25), but compare with (56b).
An appositive phrase comes, with the absolutive case inflection and in connection particularly with the reactive enclitic |=wa| (§ 54.1-i), to have a predicative force. This is a property that leads the issue of a participial relative clause
(with external head) vs. a participial mood verb 㸫 cf. § 17.2.1-vii, § 47.2.1. See
Woodbury (1985: 6972) for the significant insight in this regard.
Various combinations of nominal constituents in appositive phrases are attested, although it is very often the case that one of the constituents is a common noun. In that case, it is the semantic head to be modified by the other constituent(s). An implication of this is that CAY has no zero copula (verbless
copula) clauses created merely by juxtaposing two nominals  cf. relational
verbs (A is [someones] B; cf. § 5.1.1.3-i, § 37) instead.

A"". See also Woodbury (1985c: 275).
A periphrastic construction (§ 40.6, § 51.3) may be one of the devices to
avoid the ambiguity, but even a multi-layer construction with five arguments
may occur without much ambiguity or confusion if each party is explicit with a
free NP.
It is true that such complexity as illustrated above can indeed be too confusing to be properly understood by many speakers. But there are consultants who
testify that this degree of complexity is not in fact beyond the point of tolerance
and it may sometimes be used in daily contexts with no sense of unnaturalness.
iii) Five-layered constructions: A few consultants went further to supply me
with such six argument sentences as the following (i.e. bivalent agentive stem
nere- to eat with four VVcm). This is surely very confusing to many speakers
who are asked to interpret, unless each of the parties is expressed by independent nouns  except for the first person singular (I), which is marked in the verb
inflection:

the reverse -ni-ssuke- (for what reason she says she knows), and also confessed
that a six-layered nere-vka-a-sqe-ssuk-ni-yuk- with another speculative (A"""")

"90 Morphological preliminaries
acknowledge the tendency toward some extent of templatic ordering among
certain verb-elaborating derivational suffixes (VV; § 4.2.5.1), most notably, in
suffix compositions (§ 4.1.3.1-ii) which are semi-lexicalized (Fortescue 1980,
and its discussions in Woodbury 1981: 318331 for the Chevak dialect of
CAY), and in derivational vs. inflectional ordering in itself. See § 4.2.5.2 and
§ 4.2.5.3.
CAY does not have noun incorporation either (as stated; § 2.1-i), which is
an important morphological device for many polysynthetic languages in the
North Pacific Rim, such as Chukchi-Koryak (T. Kurebito 2001a, M. Kurebito
2001). Furthermore, CAY not only lacks the nominal suffixes as noted just
above in Mosan languages, but also such instrumental or locational affixes
(prefixes) widely employed in North American languages, though these are
often taken as one necessary characteristic of polysynthesis (Mattissen 2003,
writing on Nivkh in Sakhalin). CAY instrumental or locational suffixes are of a
totally different kind.
In § 4.2.5.1, derivational suffixes are classified, but a few features responsible for polysynthesis are mentioned beforehand:
1.3.1. Derivational suffixes in advance
i) CAY derivational suffixes, standing between a stem and an inflection, are
recursive and a word may repeatedly switch back and forth between nominals
and verbs by means of transcategorial, i.e. nominalizing and verbalizing, suffixes as illustrated in § 4.2.5.1. Because of the transcategorial conversions in
particular (fully illustrated in § 4.2.5.4.1, § 20.4, § 37.5.3.2, etc.), it is hard to
define an upper limit in polysynthesis of CAY words.
ii) In addition to an abundance of primary suffixes, there are many secondary or composite suffixes consisting of two (or more) suffixes, which, more
or less fixed and lexicalized/grammaticalized. Many of them are (very) productive and responsible for transcategorial conversions as illustrated in § 4.2.5.3.
Some composite suffixes, however, can be deceptive unless precise analysis
based on proper phonological adjustments is applied. In addition to being a
primary suffix, the causative suffix -cir- (§ 39.1.3), for instance, may reflect
different morphological sources; see i), iii), iv) under the verbalizing |-liћլ-|
(§ 38.3).
Many composite suffixes show what may be called cyclical expansion
(though not necessarily a felicitous term) by a pair of suffixes, that is,
1ĺ9ĺ1 (starting from a nominal and back to a nominal) DQG 9ĺ1ĺ9
(starting from a verb and back to a verb). And such cyclical derivation may also

exemplified in (44) by a nominal clause with successive derivations.","[141, 142]"
"Word and its constructions99ii) Verbs  are characterized by the inflectional categories of person (subject
and object; § 32) and mood (§ 46 through § 51). There are three kinds of primary stems in terms of valency, primary in the sense of being without valency
modification:
a. intransitive 8
monovalent with S (§ 33); to die, to be small
b. monotransitive bivalent
with P and A (§ 34)
agentive type
to eat [S=A]
patientive type
to break [S=P]
impersonal patientive type to freeze [S=P, with A IMP it]
c. ditransitive
trivalent
with T [theme], R [recipient], and A (§ 35)
secundative type
to give someone (something)
indirective type
to give something (to someone).
These different types of verb stems are minimally illustrated in § 5(3) and (4).
Impersonal A (AIMP) is coded in transitive inflection (as the third person singular subject), forming a transimpersonal construction (Haas 1940;
Malchukov 2008), but it cannot be externally expressed by a free NP (§ 34.3).
Primary stems may be subject to valency modification by means of valencymodifying suffixes (VVsm and VVcm; § 4.2.5.1, § 39, § 40), thereby increasing, decreasing, or rearranging one argument.
When stems (primary or modified) are inflected, they can be either of the
following (§ 32.1.2):
a. intransitive verbs
with subject marked
b. transitive verbs
with subject and object marked
Transitive verbs may be detransitivized into antipassive, medio-passive, reflexive or reciprocal, e.g. § 5(4), depending upon how the argument reduction is
made  see § 5.1.1.1-i and § 34.1 through § 34.4 for details. 9
CAY is considered not to have the so-called copula. Copula-like or
equational verbs (like A is [his]B) in CAY, which are not necessarily intransitive but may indeed be transitive, are referred to as relational verbs 10  see
§ 5.1.1.3-i and § 37. A parallel distinction between intransitive and transitive is
also made for comparative verbs (like A is bigger than [his] B)  § 5.1.1.3-ii,
§ 45.1, § 45.2. Besides intransitive vs. transitive, CAY relational and comparative verbs manifest contrast between stative and inchoative (§ 37.3, § 37.4).
iii) Non-inflecting words  consist of multisyllabic particles and monosyllabic enclitics, prosodically distinguished from each other (though some dialects

"Bilateral articulation25vance is secondary, and therefore attempts to define or analyze a word primarily
from a syntactic and/or a semantic standpoint could ultimately lead to the denial
of the concept of a word, or at least, for instance, to unrestrained use of the term
compound in linguistics descriptions for surprisingly varied entities across
languages. CAY incidentally has no compounds per se, as will be shown below
(§ 2.4, etc.).
2.3. Mismatches
Returning to the subject of bilateral articulation, it does not necessarily proceed
in perfect correspondence on two planes (expression and content), even though
the two terms of any linguistic sign, which presuppose each other, are symmetrically paired. It would not be surprising that each plane has its own motives in
the form-giving process. Terms within one plane bear multifarious se tenir
relations among themselves, independent of any within the other plane (cf.
Hjelmslev [1943] 1953 and Saussurian valeurs). These plane-internal mutual
relations of the terms, together with the pre-linguistic limiting conditions and
constraints (§ 2.1), are responsible for the abundance of apparent mismatches
between the two units on different planes, which understandably induce us to
make a distinction between a morphological / grammatical word and a phonological word.
Given the nature of bilateral articulation as part and parcel of human speech
controlled by the brain and speech organs, however, asymmetries or mismatches
between the two types of articuli on the two planes would be a natural consequence of it. Nor would it be surprising that word boundaries do not necessarily
match syntactic boundaries as in possibly controversial CAY locative verbs
(12), which, despite having two inflections (nominal and verbal) involved, are
regarded as single words, here suggested phrasal compounds (§ 2.4-vi;
§ 4.3-v).
Since a word here is taken to belong to the content plane in contrast with a
syllable on the expression plane, this grammatical description does not commit to two kinds of words (grammatical/morphological and phonological) but
sticks to only one kind of word by treating it as immediately contrasting with
what we call a bound phrase (㊿㝆⏌; with two types, i.e. clitic and non-clitic 
§ 2.3), which in turn contrasts with (free or syntactic) phrase. This hopefully
may help dissolve some of the mismatches and may suggest the possibility
that part of what are commonly treated as compounds may well be reconsidered in view of bound phrases.
In addition to mismatches, a word as a mere form is not so directly constrained by function as are syntax (in view of linguistic communication). Less
functional constraints will allow for more freedom of form, given what the26 A word in Yupik
American anthropologist A. A. Goldenwiser called principle of limited possibilities (1913). This could possibly be the very basis for how a word can vary
surprisingly in size and in function as well as in content, probably contributing
to tremendous intra- and cross-linguistic diversity, and it would be easy to see
that the formhood itself of a word is at least partly responsible for the much
greater diversity of linguistic morphology, or even that linguistic morphology is
destined to be much more diverse and complex, than syntax  hence, by the
same token, linguistic diversity than non-linguistic culture (in view of environmental adaptation). See Miyaoka (2007: 150158).
To add, articulation as a form-giving process is not only a matter of speech
but is a matter of writing by recourse to visual forms as well (§ 2.5-ii), not surprising given that writing is a more or less exact transfer of speech.
3. Words, bound phrases, and phrases
i) A word may be a free/independent word 凑䪲媅 if it occurs as a single
form or articulus to be uttered in isolation without any other word being inserted, while a language may have a clitic 媅, which is typically articulated in
phonetic dependence (i.e. clining) upon another word (host). 13
A CAY free word is either mono- or multi-morphemic and may be subject to
a great extent and variety of suffixation, which is by far the predominant morphological process in the language (§ 4.1.1). The language has no stem compounding per se (despite the oft-expressed generalization that the process is a
universal feature of language), 14 though it has two specific types of what we call
phrasal compounds  e.g. (12) below.
ii) On the other hand, CAY has a limited number of monosyllabic words,
which are predominantly enclitics ∴ 媅 marked by = (equal sign) at the beginning, as in (3), apart from one exceptional proclitic ⽳ 媅 or procliticized, as in
(15). A CAY enclitic is monosyllabic and monomorphemic. Though dependent,
it is still a word by itself with some independence and is utterly distinct either
from a suffix (derivational or inflectional) or a free word. The concept of a clitic, so called in descriptions of many languages of the world, is known to be a
knotty problem in that the demarcation between an affix and a clitic may not be
as rigid, possibly being more or less gradual (cf. Nevis 2000: 392, Dixon and
13. Shiro Hattori once proposed three basic principles for rigidly distinguishing a
bound (dependent) word from a free (independent) word (Hattori 1955: esp. 470
479), while also distinguishing between a free form 凑䔘⽉⻶ and a bound form
ếⱅ⽉⻶  note that his form is totally distinct from mine, however (§ 2.1).

"624 Nominal clauses
4. Nominalizations in main clauses
A nominal clause is complemented into a main (superordinate) clause to fill one
of its argument slots  core, demoted, or peripheral.
Word order of a nominalization in relation to the main clause is not syntactically relevant, although it may pragmatically be affected. Not so rarely, a nominalization is attested to be split by the main clause, as in the following (tangelar-aput), where the sentence-initial perlative NP is an adverbial adjunct to the
constituent in G function within the nominalization in P function:

"While loanwords from Russian have now been totally incorporated into Yupik and inflect as part of the native lexical stock (a) below, this is not yet the
case for English loans, which thus generally take a linker (b), unless (c) the
English word has already been adjusted to Yupik phonologically:
(41) a. mulukuu-mek (ABM.sg.)
b. milk-aa-mek (with LNK -a-)
c. mileg-mek.milk2.4. Inflectional suffixes (inflections)
Together with stems, inflections are obligatory elements in inflecting words
(except for the optional category of person [possessor] for nominals). 14 An inflection consists of no less than three inflectional suffixes encoding such grammatical categories as number, person (possessor), and case for nominals, and
person (subject and object) and mood for verbs, which are often phonologically
fused. Tense-aspect and modality are not inflectional categories of the language
but are derivational and not obligatory  cf. § 42, § 43. Gender and nominal
classification play little role in CAY, and its grammar focuses little on sex distinctions. Glosses for the third person are thus given for convenience as it, its
(for non-humans) or he, his, him (for humans), unless it is pragmatically adequate to use she, her.
i) CAY distinguishes three numbers, i.e. singular (sg.), dual (du.), and plural
(pl.), and four persons, i.e. first (1), second (2), third (3), and reflexive-third
(3R), each in all of the three numbers. Use of duality is rapidly declining among
young speakers, which is one of the most obvious and remarkable decays in the
inflectional system of the language.
The reflexive-third person, which occurs with possessed nominals and with
participial, connective, and appositional mood verbs (below), is triggered by the
third person subject (S/A) as the syntactic pivot of the main clause.
14. Even though person (possessor) is not necessarily an obligatory category for
nominals, it is fused with number and case and has to be considered as part of inflection.",[166]
"A long sequence of suffixes may cause some confusion for some speakers.
In the following two words with reverse-ordered suffixes, the second may be
taken as having the meaning of the first (though not vice versa):
(57) a. pissur-ciqe-nqigg-ni-a
she says that he will go hunting again

b. pissur-ciq-ni-nqigt-aa
she again says that he will go hunting
hunt-FUT-A'.say-again-IND.3sg.3sg.
On the other hand, in such cases, the following analytic or periphrastic expression with the prop-verb |pi-| (or explicit |qanћլ-| to say) would unmistakably be understood as equivalent to (b) above (cf. § 51.3.2):
(58)pissur-ciqe-ni-luku
pi-nqigt-uq
hunt-FUT-A'.say-APP.3sg.
do-again-IND.3sg.
she again says that he will go hunting.",[175]
"24 A word in Yupik
could suggest that grammatical and semantic content is secondary to words as a
linguistic form.
Besides the psychological reality, an important corollary of morphological
articulation or the formhood may be that only when it is articulated or formed
can a word undergo change or dilution/bleaching in content as a whole, a phenomenon that may be found in any human language. Expletives 12 (or meaningless particles far beyond more or less opaque lexicalizations or grammaticalizations) could be expected to serve in languages merely as empty fillers of
syntactic or phonological slots. Expletivity would be a sheer necessity for the
mere formhood of words as such.
In this vein, some rare morphological processes in languages, apparently
anomalous or idiosyncratic, could be understood only if words are viewed as
nothing but a form (Miyaoka 2002: 143147)  § 2.3.3.
ii) As a matter of fact, it tends to be commonly accepted that a word is a static, fixed, or ready-made entity established prior to each speaker and stored as a
single concept. In languages like Eskimo, however, words may also be a dynamic, flexible, and continuous form-giving process by which each speaker is
capable of producing a new word, even with a sentence-like content, a-matterof-coursely or far from being nonce or ad-hoc, although within certain limits (as
illustrated in § 4.2.5.4.1 in particular), and strictly following collectively shared
predetermined morphological and phonological patterns unique to the language
concerned (cf. § 2.5-i).
As such, a CAY word has the potential to be full of content and functionally
equivalent to complex sentences in many other languages, packed with a variety
of concrete, abstract, and grammatical concepts (as if to the bursting point). At
the other extreme, in the same language, it may also be an expletive devoid of
content that merely fills out a sentence  e.g. cushion-like sentence fillers
(§ 53.6), which may have an important pragmatic effect. There should be nothing surprising about this, given that a word as a mere form is, as Sapir (1921:
33) exquisitely defined it,  a definitely molded entity that takes in as much
or as little of the conceptual material of the whole thought as the genius of the
language cares to allow [emphasis mine]. If it were the case, this may lead to
the conclusion that, as far as a word is concerned, its syntactic or semantic rele12. Expletives are words that are empty in content but simply fill a phonological
and/or syntactical slot (cf. Latin explere to fill out) and are not necessarily limited
to isolating languages characterized by high monosyllabicity (below). Whereas a
word can be empty content-wise, a morpheme on the content plane, by definition,
must be full (not meaningless). One may be reminded that Louis Hjelmslev felicitously coined the glossematic terms plereme (with the same root to fill) corresponding to morphemes and ceneme (empty) to phonemes (then perhaps implying the meaningless morpheme as an oxymoron).","[75, 76]"
