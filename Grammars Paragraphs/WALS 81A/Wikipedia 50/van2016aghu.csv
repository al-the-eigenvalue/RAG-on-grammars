"Coming back to the tendency in Papuan languages to avoid a stacking of
(pro)nouns for referent tracking, it should be pointed out that Aghu has278PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structuredeveloped an effective way of referent tracking: In addition to the inflection
of person and number on the verb, the language has developed a switch
reference system, with nonfinites indicating same subject (SS), and
semifinites implying different subject (DS). More on this can be found in
chapter 5, especially 5.4.
To conclude, it should be noted that the word order as described by Drabbe
is not without exception. The text corpus does contain a number of
examples where the object precedes the subject. One of these cases is
presented below. Although the number of examples is too small to draw
any rigid conclusions on factors influencing word order, it is not unlikely
that in a case like (453) the initial position of the indirect object has to do
with its topicality. The sentence is about the two boys who have received
food (from a parrot), even though the two are not framed here as a subject
(which is the grammatical role that usually coincides with the pragmatic
role of topic (cf. footnote 202)).

adds a footnote stating that this is not the normal word order and that the

clear indication that also here the deviating word order has to do with the
topicality of the object.

(6.202)4.1.1 Experiential clauses
Drabbe 1957: section 60, p. 23b-24aLike many Papuan languages, 201 Aghu has a number of ‘experiential verbs’,
which are listed below. Semantically, these verbs have at least one200“En de spullen, die neemt de vrouw over” (Drabbe 1957:87, note 127).","[295, 296, 297]"

"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure275The text corpus contains a few examples of ditransitive clauses, two of
which are presented here. Note that both of them lack an overt subject.

them and they eat.’ (1.054)Drabbe writes that the normal order in clauses is subject, object, verb.
Expressions of time usually come in first position, while expressions of
place follow the subject. If we have two non-subject arguments, their
mutual order is free. According to Drabbe, the NP directly preceding the
verb receives more emphasis. Thus, in (450) below, it is emphasized that it
is ‘to my wife’ that the taro are given, more than what is given. Following
traditional terminology, Drabbe describes the recipient as the indirect object
and the gift as the direct object. We will follow Drabbe at this point.198
198It should be noted that the terms subject, direct object and indirect object are generallytaken as indications of grammatical roles, which intermediate between semantic roles (like
Agent, Recipient) and pragmatic roles (like topic, focus, pragmatic pivot; cf. Andrews
2007). One should, therefore, have formal grammatical criteria to distinguish between
grammatical roles like direct object and indirect object, and not semantic criteria like
‘referring to a recipient’ versus ‘referring to the undergoer’. We have insufficient data,276(450)PART I: GRAMMAR.

1957:43b)In addition to order, the syntactic function of noun phrases (including
pronouns) may be indicated by case markers: the nominative marker te or
the accusative marker ke; That they should be analyzed as case markers is
further explained in 4.4. These markers are optional, and do not need to be
used when the function of the NP is clear from the context. Their precise
pragmatic function remains unclear. It is important to note, however, that
the use of te seems to be restricted to humans and larger animals: this is
stated explicitly by Drabbe for its use in non-verbal clauses, but might be
true for its use in verbal clauses too.199however, to find these grammatical criteria. Moreover, many of these criteria, like
coreference relations in clause linking, can only be found out in fieldwork experiments, by
asking informants for grammaticality judgments etc. As this is not possible, it seems most
practical to follow Drabbe’s terminology, and use a loose semantic criterion to distinguish
between the two roles.
199Because Drabbe does not state this for verbal clauses, however, this is not more than anassumption. The text corpus contains only two examples of nominative te (2.074 and
7.065), which happen to be cases of reference to humans.","[292, 293, 294]"

"4 Clause structureThis chapter discusses the structure of clauses. The focus of the chapter is
on main independent clauses: those clauses that can stand on their own, and
need not be followed by another clause in order to be grammatical; in Aghu
this category is formed by clauses headed by semifinite and finite verbs
(and nonverbal clauses). Some attention will also be given, however, to
clauses headed by nonfinite verbs. These clauses cannot stand on their own
and need to be followed by another clause in order to form a grammatical
sentence.
A clause can be defined as “the linguistic expression of a proposition”
(Payne 1997:71). In the present study, a verbal clause may contain
maximally one inflected verb: a nonfinite, semifinite or fully finite verb.
Sequences of verbs within one sentence are referred to as ‘clause chains’ or
even sequences of clause chains, more on which can be found in Chapter 5.
The first section of this chapter discusses verbal clauses (with the exception
of those headed by the copula verb ki(k) ‘become’), while the second
section deals with nonverbal clauses: nominal, adjectival and numeral
clauses. The second section closes with a section on clauses headed by the
copula verb ki(k). The remainder of the chapter will deal with a number of
other phenomena that operate at clause level. Section 4.6, finally, will
summarize the similarities and differences between the types of clauses that
were discussed: verbal and non-verbal positive, negative and question
clauses.","[288, 289]"
"PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlist
reference to the wordlist means that the item was not attested in this list,
but only in one or more of the other sources. See, for example, abi or
abibiamV. Coming back to the references in non-bold, the following
method was followed. If an item was attested in the text corpus, I have
always added at least one reference to a place of occurence. In addition, I
have added references to sections in Drabbe or in this publication, only in
those cases where the form was not attested in the text corpus, or in cases
where these extra references were considered useful for the reader.
Verbs are given in their stem_I form; the form of the realis marker is given
in brackets, directly following the stem; cf. section 2.3.1.1. For the
corresponding forms of stem_II and the imperative stems, the reader is
referred to sections 2.2 and 2.5 respectively. For stems in -mV (where V is
a harmonizing vowel, cf. section 1.3) and those ending in nasal vowel, the
forms of the realis marker are predictable (-ox and -g, respectively, see
section 2.3.1.1), and, therefore, not indicated. Iterative stems have also not
been included; these can be found in section 2.4.1.
The words are presented in alphabetical order, where the mutual order of
unmodified vowels, nasal vowels and long vowels is random. For example,the order of ã, a and ā is random (all count as a). The same is true for the
mutual order of u and ü: both count as u. The consonant x ([x]) counts as
the English consonant x: it follows the consonant w and precedes z (y is not
attested in Aghu). Compounds directly follow the (first) word with which
they form a compound, so that e.g. a-müto is presented higher in the
alphabetical list than a word like abi.
Although Drabbe discusses the different parts of speech, and is aware that
there is not a one to one correspondence between parts of speech in Dutch
and in Aghu, he has refrained from giving the part of speech for each stem.
This means that the indication of the part of speech in this publication is389390PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlistsometimes not more than an ‘informed guess.’ An exception is formed by
words belonging to the class of verbs, as they can be formally
dinstuinguished from other forms by having a realis marker. Also formally
distinguishable are those adverbs that end in -mu. Apart from these verbs
and adverbs, the indicaton of membership is based on the meaning of the
form, based on the class membership indicated by Drabbe, or based on the
use of the form in the text corpus. In those cases where neither of these
criteria is sufficient, I have placed a question mark, as in the examples
presented below. The question mark proceeding n at ake indicates that it
might be a noun. As is clear from the remark, however, it is not attested as
an independent noun, so that it is only the analogy to other compounds
(where the second position is filled by a noun, cf. section 3.1) that would
justify the analysis of ake as a noun. The question mark after akimu
indicates that the part of speech is unclear. As indicated in the explanatory
remark, the word is attested only in combination with a following verb ogü,
and not attested independently. (It could be an adverb in -mu (cf. section
3.4.2), but lack of comparable forms, e.g. forms from which the adverb
could have been derived, makes this rather hypothetical.)Figure 20: part of the Aghu-English wordlist, with indication of the use of question marksThe translations in this word list are not always exactly the same as those
that we find as glosses in the text corpus. This is because the glossing in the
text corpus suffers from technical limitations, like the impossibility to use
multi-word descriptions in interlinear glossing, or the wish to keep the
glosses as compact as possible.","[406, 407, 408]"

sequentiality. The use of -ku, in other words, indicates:232One might want to argue that -ku and -ne are clitics rather than suffixes, because theycan be attached to a wider range of verbs than most affixes, to verbs that do not need this

"When nouns are used as subject of a verb, we find an interesting
discrepancy between more animate and less animate nouns. For more
animate nouns, referring to bigger animals and human beings, subject
inflection on the verb is either singular or plural. This means that for thesePART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes163more animate nouns the interpretation of the NP as referring to a singular
entity or more entities is guided by the inflection on the verb (optionally
supported by the use of joxo ‘3PL’ directly following the noun, see 3.1.5.5).
Compare the following two examples, where the verb of the first example
exhibits singular inflection, and the verb of the second example plural
inflection.

Especially for nouns referring to larger objects and trees, reference to164PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesmultiple entities may but need not be expressed by plural inflection. The
situation can be visualized as follows:
Humans; larger animals; ?smaller animals; trees; larger objects; smaller objects; mass nouns 122plural subject inflection on verb
singular subject inflection on verb
Figure 13: Animacy and the use of plural subject inflection on the verbIn the figure above, the question mark indicates that the precise behavior of
the respective category is not clear. The use of dashed instead of closed
lines indicates that the borders between the categories are not clear. In
sentence 10 below, for example, we find two nouns that refer to smaller
objects, which nevertheless combine with plural inflection. I would
hypothesize that here plural inflection is used because of the strong
association with animacy; it might even be that here the genitals, as it were,
represent or stand for the persons themselves.

(2.133)122The choice for singular inflection in (195) and (196) above could be explained on theassumption that the sago crumbs and the fruits are conceived of not as multiple individual
objects, but as a collective whole. This might be taken as an argument in favor of an
analysis in which it is ‘individuation’ rather than animacy that underlies the hierarchy; for
a discussion of individuation, and a hierarchy based on this concept cf. Audring 2009:123f.","[180, 181, 182]"
"An example of such an overt subject is gõ ‘blood’ in the example below.
Although Drabbe writes that it is also possible to use overt free pronouns as
subjects, he does not give any examples for verbal clauses.196(444)Gõmike.gõmi-kebloodcome.down-N1.RLS[SG]‘Blood comes down.’ (1.012)Clauses may be intransitive, transitive or ditransitive. Analogous to what
we saw for subjects above, objects may be left out if their identity is clear
from the context. This is in line with a general distributive tendency in
many Papuan languages for the verb to occur without any associated
nominals at all (cf. Foley 1986:70, cited in de Vries 2005:813), and with the
observation by de Vries that many Papuan languages “have little room fornouns and pronouns to track given, active referents” (2006:183). Consider
the following passage. In (446) we first find the intransitive clause xodok,196In the text corpus, the only examples of free pronouns in subject position are pronounsfollowed by ke ta ‘FOC IN.TURN’; focused 3SG pronouns were described 3.2.3.2274PART I: GRAMMAR.

explicit object, as the identity of the object is clear from the preceding

made explicit in the clauses abu ‘he took it’ and toxoŋge ‘he cut it in big

discuss the precise conditions under which sentences which lack an overt object may be

"The locative marker de seems, therefore, mutually exclusive with focus on
the location. The same principle might explain why the locative marker isPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs137also lacking when posture verbs are combined with demonstratives, which
is the topic of this section. 100,101
Drabbe writes that the notion of ‘being present’ can be expressed bycombining a demonstrative element (nego ‘THIS’, xo ‘DST’ or ü ‘there’)
with the durative form of posture verbs. The demonstrative element directly
precedes the verb, and for a number of demonstrative-verb combinations
the language has developed contracted forms. Table 35 shows the forms for
combinations of posture verbs with nego ‘THIS’, where it should be noted
that nigi is used instead of nego.102100This explanation is based on the assumption that there is a positive correlation betweendemonstrative deixis and focus: demonstratives will usually be focused and therefore not
be followed by de. By frequency of association, what starts off as a tendency:
demonstratives are usually not followed by de, may grow into a grammatical restriction:
demonstratives cannot be followed by de, but directly precede the verb. That
demonstratives frequently precede the verb is proven by the existence of the contracted
forms under discussion here.
101It should be noted that locative verbs may easily bring along a focus on the clause as awhole, which Lambrecht describes as ‘presentational’ or ‘thetic’ focus (1994: 141,
168,233). An example of a thetic focus in this context would be a sentence like ‘there’smother sitting there’, where the whole sentence is an assertion, or ‘new information’. In
order to decide whether the verbs under discussion here bring along this reading, however,
we would need examples of the use of these sentences in daily conversation.
102Although Drabbe might be right in his suggestion that nigi is a contracted form of negoand the durative prefix -i, it is remarkable that except from here, durative i- and
durative -ke are never used simultaneously.","[154, 155]"
"280PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureargument, which can best be characterized as (subtype of the category of)
experiencer: it is sentient, not instigating the event, and affected by the
event. Pragmatically, this experiencer is the topic, representing what the
sentence is about. On the basis of its pragmatics, therefore, one would
expect it to be realized as a subject, as there is a strong association between
‘being the subject’ and ‘being the (sentential) topic’. 202 Semantically,
however, the experiencer deviates from the prototypical semantic properties
associated with subjects (sentient, but instigating and not affected), and is
actually closer to the semantic prototype of objects. 203 This section
describes the solution developed in the Aghu language to deal with this
tension.
In Aghu, there is a split in behavior between singular and 1PL experiencerarguments on the one hand, and N1 plural arguments on the other hand.
When the relevant argument belongs to the first category, the language uses
an ‘experiential construction’, which reflects the semantic nature of the
experiencer as being more closely associated with objects than with
subjects. The verb has (impersonal) 3SG inflection, while the argument is
optionally marked as accusative, by the use of the postpositional case
marker ke ‘ACC’. This is illustrated in (455) below. When the argument is
N1 plural, however, it behaves as a normal subject in a normal verbalclause: the subject is optionally marked as nominative by the use of te,
while verbal inflection is N1PL, showing agreement with the subject. This is
illustrated in (456).","[297, 298]"

part of a possessive construction of the form described in 3.1.2, however,efe can also be used in combination with other nouns. Drabbe gives the
following examples:
(240)kitoefewomufoot3SGmiddle‘the middle toe / thirteen’ (Drabbe 1957: 7b)
(241)büsiüefetohouse3SGopening‘house door’ (Drabbe 1957: 7b)190PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesInstead of efe, one may also use one of the pronouns wofe(ne) or xofe(ne),
which are formed from wo ‘THAT’ and xo ‘DIST’ plus fe, but which I have
glossed simply as 3SG forms. The only example of these forms given by
Drabbe is the following, where we find the vowel e assimilated to the i of
the following noun. Assimilation to a following i is also not uncommon forefe, as can be seen in example b.

expressions of space, I will make use of the term deictic center (DC) to
refer to the ‘point in space’ from where a situation is viewed. This section
will first focus on the form of demonstrative pronouns, and then go deeper

"The quote above summarizes the main point: clauses headed by less
inflected verbs depend for their interpretation on the next fully inflected
verb to their right, but are at the same time not a constituent of the clause
containing the fully inflected verb. Following Foley (2010), these clauses
are probably better characterized as coordinate rather than subordinate.223
223It is not so easy to prove, however, that the dependent clauses in Aghu are coordinaterather than subordinate. According to Foley (2010), subordinate clauses are always
constituents of the main clause: either as a core argument, in which case they are
complement clauses; or as oblique arguments, in which case they are adverbial subordinate
clauses, or as modifier of a nominal constituent, in which case they are relative clauses.
One could state, therefore, that subordinate clauses, are ‘nominalized’, or — generally —
formally marked as noun phrases.
While in certain other Awyu-Dumut languages dependent clauses can be contrasted with
subordinate structures in which the clause is nominalized (cf. Wester 2014: 158 f.; de Vries
2005:372-377), this is not the case in Aghu; it is impossible to use language-internal
criteria to contrast the dependent clauses under discussion here with subordinate clauses.
Still, it makes more sense to consider them coordinate rather than subordinate. The main
reasons for this are the following: (1) There is simply no evidence that the clauses are
embedded in the following clause with fully inflected verb, and there is no evidence that
the clauses are nominalized (unless we follow Drabbe’s analysis of ke, see below); (2)
Drabbe never translates the dependent clauses in Aghu as complement clauses or relative
clauses, which — as stated by Foley 2010:32 — are typical functions of subordinate
clauses in Papuan languages. Although it is true that translations can never be taken as
evidence for the existence or non-existence of a certain grammatical construction, I
nevertheless believe that the total lack of relative and complement clauses in the Dutch
translation is telling; (3) although Drabbe refers to the nonfinite forms as deelwoordenPART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations3135.4 Aghu and switch reference
As stated in the previous section, switch reference systems typically appear
in clause-chaining languages. As argued in de Vries (2010), who modifies a
theory set out in in Haiman and Munro (1983), clause chaining structures
are the result of coordination reduction in thematic continuity conditions,
where the basic principle is that those operators that are consistent over the
clauses are marked only on the verb of the final clause. De Vries shows
how, for Dumut languages, reduction took place in a diachronic process, in
cases where the operators of tense, mood and subject of a series of clauses
were continuous. In this process, verbs in SS conditions were the first to be
reduced and to become part of a chaining structure. Present Dumut
languages show the traces of this diachronic process: All Dumut languages
have dedicated nonfinite SS forms, which lack a specification for tense,
mood and person, while only some have dedicated DS forms. These DS
forms have grown from the non-reduced forms when used as non-final verb
in a series of clauses; as the use of reduced forms was restricted to SS
conditions, the non-reduced forms came to be associated with DS conditions.
In Dumut languages, then, we find (apart from the tensed forms which(‘participles’), he places the words in apostrophes to show that they are different from
participles. The difference may very well be that participles are embedded while nonfinites
are not; (4) There are very clear cases where nonfinite clauses present foreground
information, e.g. in the durative constructions discussed in Durative aspect expressed by
constructions with posture verbs and at the end of 5.4.1.1. This is very unusual for
subordinate structures (cf. Dooley 2010). With regard to the first point, it should be noted
that the connective =k that is optionally used after nonfinites is considered by Drabbe the
same as the oblique marker ke used after nouns. Although it cannot be excluded that there
is a diachronic connection between the two particles, I believe that the two particles
synchronically have very different functions. The use of =k after nonfinite verbs cannot
be used, therefore, as an argument that the nonfinite clause would have been nominalized,
and that it would, therefore, be in a subordinate relation to the final clause.","[330, 331]"

constituents is often a matter of interpretation by the language user (Booij
2005:75). Language users have to interpret the relationship on the basis of
the meaning of the composing parts, their knowledge of the world, and
sometimes on the basis of the context. At the same time, one may think of
certain types of compounds as imposing a ‘semantic scheme’ on the
composing parts and or on the resultant meaning. This scheme may be
rather loose, and put only few restrictions on the possible range of
constituents, or rather strict, allowing only for certain constituents, and
specifying the semantic relation between the parts as well as the meaning of
the whole. If we compare the two types of compounds in Aghu, it seems
that those of type 2 are more specific or answer to a stricter scheme than
those of type 1. For compounds of type 2, Drabbe gives the following three
subtypes, with a strictly defined range of possible constituents — fillers ofthe N1 and N2 positions in the figure below — and a strictly defined
relation between the two composing parts. . Drabbe is not explicit about thequestion whether the modifying elements in these compounds are also
attested as separate words.","[163, 164]"

again makes more sense than the analysis as a case marker. This is mainly
because in non-verbal clauses we cannot find a grammatical opposition
between the use of ke and the use of te as we found in verbal clauses.
Examples of the use of ke marking a complement are found in (464)-(467)
above, the last of which has been copied here as (526).218
(526)WikedepigFOCCOP‘it’s a pig’ (Drabbe 1957:8b)The analysis of ke as a focus marker is supported by other contexts whereke is best analyzed as such. We also find ke in the subject position of
verbal clauses, always in combination with a free pronoun, and often
followed by ta. This was discussed extensively in Chapter 3; the use of eke,
a cliticized form efe ‘3SG’ plus ke ‘FOC’, was discussed in 3.2.3.2, while theuse of ke ‘FOC’ in combination with other pronouns came along in the218Dixon (2010b:159 f.) refers to copula as copula verbs and to the predicate as the copulacomplement. He writes that cross-linguistically copula complements are often not casemarked at all. He also points out, however, that we find other possibilities, like some
Eastern European languages where copula complements can be marked either with
nominative, or with oblique case, dependent on the nature of the relation: permanent or
temporary (ibid: 170). From a functional point of view, it is not so surprising that a copula
complement can be marked either way: it has the same referent as the subject-topic, but
generally refers to an object that is affected, which is typical for objects. In Aghu we find
all three possibilities: no marking, marking with a a nominative marker te (which usually
marks subjects), and marking with a focus marker ke, possibly historically related to an
accusative marker ke (which usually marks objects).","[319, 320]"
"3.1.7 Optional non-inflectional case markers te and ke
Drabbe 1957: section 103c, p. 42a; section 103p, p. 43bThis section discusses the case markers te and ke as attested in verbal
clauses. For a discussion that includes the marking of pronouns and NP’s,
in non-verbal clauses the reader is referred to section 4.4.
In verbal clauses, pronouns and noun phrases can be followed by one of the
case markers te or ke (or kèmu / kumu, see 3.6.2 below). Te ‘NOM’ is
optionally used to mark a subject, while ke ‘ACC’ may be used to mark the
object. In this book I will use the term object for those constituents that can
be marked with ke and which bear the semantic role of patient, beneficiary
or target. In addition, ke may be used to mark a location or a temporal
expression, although we hardly have any examples of the latter use. 135
Although te and ke belong to the class of postpositional case markers that
will be discussed in 3.6, the fact that they mark the central syntactic
functions of subject and object justifies an additional discussion here. Te
and ke may be seen as having a disambiguating function, as they can easily
be left out when the context makes clear what is intended. Compare the
following examples, where the interpretation of (221a) is dependent on the
context and allows for different readings out of context, but ( b) and ( c )135In fact, the only example is the expression womiŋ ge / gèmu ‘in the night’ provided byDrabbe in his discussion on kèmu, kumu and ke (Drabbe 1957:42a). Cf. 3.6.2 below.",[193]
"When used as arguments in verbal clauses, the interrogative pronouns
behave the same as nouns. They optionally combine with the nominative or
accusative cases markers te NOM or ke ACC, as can be seen in (264) and
(265)a-c below. Note that, parallel to what we saw for full NP’s in 3.1.7, te
is used to mark either an intransitive subject (as in (264)) or a transitive
subject (as in (265)a and b), while ke is used to mark an object. As is clear
from (265)a-c, the function of the case marker is to disambiguate between
different syntactic roles. The fact, however, that it is also possible to use a
case marker in (264) — where the syntactic role of meoxo is not ambiguous
— shows that it must also have a pragmatic function.154(264)meoxo(te)da-xewho(NOM)come-N1.RLS[SG]‘Who has come?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)

In (250) below, the demonstrative pronoun takes the position of the
possessor, which is an illustration of number 4 in the list above. The use of

the entire text collection, all lexical material, and the grammatical analysis
of Drabbe (1957) available to a wider public, including those who are not
competent in Dutch. Although the present book is entirely based on Drabbe
(1957), and generally follows his grammatical analysis rather closely, at
points I have added some of my own insights, or tried to make a connection
with relevant developments in linguistic theory that have taken place since
the Fifties (e.g. a growing understanding of clause chaining and switch
reference).
This adaptation has been written as part of the project The Awyu Dumutfamily of Papuan languages in its linguistic and cultural context. In this
project the different languages that are part of the Greater Awyu language
group have been compared, and documented in more detail.5 At times, I
have made reference to other publications that have resulted from this
project, especially where new insights shed light on analytical problems
within Aghu.
Great care has been taken to indicate clearly in the text where my analysis
differs from Drabbe’s. At the same time, in order to enhance the
comparison between this book and the original, each section closes with a
list of references to the corresponding sections in Drabbe (1957). The
structure of this book follows that of Drabbe: Part I, consisting of chapters5This project took place at the VU University of Amsterdam, and was supported by De NederlandseOrganisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, reference number 380-89-020.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

The expression used for catching fish is widi gike, which refers to the
activity of scraping off a poisonous root in the water, in order to
poison part of a river and to intoxicate fish and catch it afterwards
(Drabbe 1957:57a, 84b (note 19)). Fishing by poisoning is not uncommon in
the area, and was also described for e.g. the Korowai in van Enk and de
Vries 1997:28).",[472]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes257corpus likewise lacks examples of conjoined Noun Phrases. As an
alternative to conjoined noun phrase, we find examples like (406) below.
There we can observe an asyndetic repetition of the same verb axe ‘he
takes’ with a different object: first xabü ‘stone axe’, and then motü ‘sack’.","[274, 275]"
"3.2.3 Free (and possessive) pronouns: distribution
If we want to discuss the use of free pronouns and possessive pronouns, the
first thing to be noted is that the great majority of verbal clauses in Aghu
lack overt free pronouns; they are used only for special rhetorical purposes.
Second it should be noted that Drabbe’s text corpus is highly biased in that
it contains very few examples of direct speech. This makes it very hard to
make a comparison between the use of 3rd person pronouns and the use of
1st and 2nd person pronouns. At this point it suffices to follow Drabbe’s
description, who states:PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes181“Nu and nugu [1st person, WvdH] are not often used as subject of a verbal clause, as in
such sentences the person is clear from subject inflection on the verb. The 2 nd and 3rd
person pronouns are attested more frequently, as verb inflection does not distinguish
between 2nd and 3rd person, but when it is clear from the context which person is intended
they are often left out. Efe never appears without ke or te, neither as subject, nor as object,
nor as predicate in nominal clauses. When te is used one says efe te. With ke the two are
contracted into eke. Eke is sometimes also used as subject.”","[198, 199]"
"201It is Drabbe (1957:23b) who points out that most Papuan languages have a class ofverbs that are used ‘eventively’, where the logical subject functions as grammatical object.
Foley (1986:121f) points out that many Papuan languages have impersonal constructions in
which the animate participant functions as a passive, non-controlling undergoer. Although
Foley focuses on languages where these impersonal constructions function to distinguish
between controlled and uncontrolled events, these impersonal constructions are formally
very similar to the experiential constructions that we find in Aghu. De Vries (2006:814)
discusses experiential constructions in the light of ‘thematizing preferences in Papuanlanguages’. He argues that the impersonal constructions involving experiential topics in
Kombai and Inanwatan may have developed out of expressions in which the experiencertopic formed a syntactically non-integrated part of the sentence, which became
intonationally and syntactically integrated into a conventional clause structure. For
experiential verbs in Kombai see de Vries and Wiersma (1992:16).",[297]

In order to tear the leaves, they probably make use of their teeth to
make a good start (Lourens de Vries, p.c.).
Atetam 'split.IT' is the reduplicated form of atame 'split', where the
reduplication expresses iterativity; it is not just one, but many leaves
that are split (Drabbe 1957ː56, 84a (note 7)), and, according to Drabbe's
translation, also into many parts. For the relation between the
allomorphs atetam and atetame, see 2.3.1.1, where it is described that
stems ending in -mV and derived from *mV 'do' have combine with the
N1.realis marker -oxe and have vowel elision.","[457, 458]"
"Atumiobüsiüba-xe-nãAtumiohousesit-N1.RLS-N1PL‘Atumio and his clan mates live in a settlement.’ (5.02)3.1.5.6 Verbs implying plurality of subject or object
Plurality can also be implied by the verb, in the sense that iterative verbs
(see 2.4.1) often imply a plural object. Examples given by Drabbe are wisaxa [shoot.IT pig] ‘shoot pigs’ and büsiü sigumùdu [house build.IT] ‘build
houses’, which refer to repetitive shooting and building, respectively, andtherefore (in most contexts) imply plural objects. In at least two cases we
have a suppletive iterative verb implying a plural subject: kü ̃ is the neutralword for ‘die’, which may have a singular or a plural subject (e.g. 1.300and 2.149, respectively), while suppletive iterative xani ‘die.IT’ implies aplural subject (e.g. 2.105). Analogously, we find kunum’ i(g) ‘sleep’ witheither singular or plural subject, and kunũ xanda(x) ‘sleep.IT’ implying a
plural subject.128128The form is attested in 2.2, where Drabbe adds that it combines with a plural subject,and in sentence 5.28 of the tekst corpus.",[189]
"Coming to the distribution of verbal nouns, their distribution comes close to
that of nouns:
a. they can be argument (subject or object) of a predicate;
b. they can be predicated over by means of the predicator de;
c. they can be marked for (dative) case;
d. they can take the position of the possessed noun in a
possessive construction; vowel initial verbs in this position
combine with the possessive linker nThey differ from nouns, however, in that they can also be predicated over
by oxo, a predicator that is otherwise never used for nouns, but only for the
predication of adjectives and numerals (cf. section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). The
remainder of this section will first discuss and illustrate the different
distributional properties of verbal nouns mentioned above, and then give
some additional contexts in which they are used. We will begin, therefore,
with contexts in which the verbal nouns clearly take a position usually
reserved for nouns.",[73]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations333Drabbe continues by giving a somewhat different case, in which the second
clause forms a specification of the first clause:
“Consider the following, additional, example: jã bodo kutofidik tümoxe, xabã tümoxe ‘he
put (the defeated one) on a tree branch and cut off, he cut off the head; one may considerxabã tümoxe as a new sentence, in which the narrator gives an explanation of the
preceding sentence” (Drabbe 1957:19b).248Summarizing, Drabbe describes how, especially in slow speech, a sequence
of two semifinite clauses can be used in SS conditions. In this respect, Aghu
fits a general tendency in Awyu Dumut languages, which was described by
Wester (2014:179). Wester points out that semi-finite forms may have the
same subject as the next verb in case at least one of the following two
conditions is met:
a. The verbs must express sequential actions that have no
temporal overlap or
b. The second verb must occur in a clause that further explains
the clause in which the first verb occurs.
Although these conditions do seem to hold in Aghu, I would like to add
another, formal criterion: in the data available to us, the great majority of
semifinite clauses with SS interpretation are followed by a break, indicated
by a comma, a semicolon or a temporal expression like bagidi ‘next day’.249248“Ziehier een ander voorb.: jã bodo kutofidik tümoghe, ghabã tümoghe hij legde (deverslagene) op een boomtak en sneed af, hij sneed het hoofd af; ghabã tümoghe kan men
beschouwen als een nieuwe zin, waarin de verteller uitleg geeft van het voorafgaande.”
249We restrict ourselves to sequences of verbs within one and the same sentence. Examplesof semifinites with same subject separated by ba-gidi sit-next.day — which marks the endof a clause chain — are plenty. The following list forms only a small part: 1.016, 1.017,
1.019, 1.021, 1.023, 1.025 (...) 1.116. Some of the few exceptions to the strong tendency334PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinationsIf we recall that clause chains are defined as clauses demarcated by pauses,
we must conclude that — within the definition that we use in this book —
these semifinites belong to different clause chains, although they are part of
the same sentence. We can still state, therefore, that sequences of
semifinites within a clause chain imply DS; over clause chains, however,
they may be used in SS conditions. This is only possible, however, if the
conditions (a) and (b) given above are answered. In other words, in order
for a sequence of semifinite verbs within one sentence to be interpreted as
having the same subject, separation by a pause is a necessary, but not a
sufficient condition.250
Sentences (570) through (572), all taken from the text corpus, form a good
illustration of these ‘inter-clause-chain’ but intra-sentential sequences of
semifinites. The relevant verb forms have been printed in bold. First
consider (570). The sequence of memoxenã ‘they continue (placing)’ and
described above are the following (these are intra-clause-chain semifinites referring to the
same subject): 2.150, 2.173 (where we find two semifinites separated by dateke. If we takedateke as a temporal expression analogous to bagidi, however, we might also state that it
introduces a new clause chain, which would make the relation between the two verbs interclause-chainal rather than intra-clause-chainal), last two verbs of 5.16.
250This means that the text corpus also contains examples of DS forms within one sentenceseparated by a pause. A clear example is found in 5.16, presented here, where we find a
switch of subject between afamoxe and ogüke and again between ogüke and sibumoxe.
Between sibumoxe and kifioxe there is no change of subject:Xatiwokifetoafamoxe,siaxatiwokifetoafam-oxesiaagainbamboo3SGopeningopen -N1.RLS[SG]cricketogüke,sibumoxekifioxe.ogü -kesibum-oxekifi -oxego.down.close-N1.RLS[SG]close -N1.RLS[SG]lay.down -N1.RLS[SG]‘He opens another bamboo case, and a cricket goes in, he closes it off and lays it down.’ (5.16)PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations335daxenã ‘they come’ answers criterion (a): the verbs express sequential
actions that have no temporal overlap. The sequence of daxenã and daxenã
is seen as an instance of condition (b): the second clause forms a
specification of the first. We see something similar in the repetition of the
verb bimoxenã in (571): the second clause specifies that it is the front of the
body that is cut open. The sequence of bimoxenã and afogioxenã in the
same sentence is probably best explained as expressing two events that have
no overlap, although it is also possible to read the second clause as a
specification or explanation of the first.

‘They cut him open, they cut open the front of his body; they pull it open.’ (8.004)Another clear example of verbs expressing sequential events is given in
(572), where the two verbs in bold express subsequent events. The sentence
also forms a good illustration of the principle that a sequence of two verbs
within one and the same clause chain implies a change in subject: the
sequence of kimoxenã, doxe and eŋgenã all implies a double change in336PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinationssubject: from the ‘roasters’ to the food that is cooked through back to those
who have roasted and who are now going to eat.

weaknesses of our definition of the sentence as a meaningful unit. Exactly
the same sequence of words is marked by Drabbe as one sentence in 3.045,
example (573), but as two different sentences in 3.007 and 3.008, example
(574). Although it cannot be excluded that there were some intonational
differences between these utterances, it is more likely that Drabbe didn’t
adopt very strict criteria in deciding whether clauses belong to the same or
to different sentences.

3.008)Summarizing, we can state that sequences of semifinite verbs within a
clause chain imply a very strong likelihood for the second verb to have a
different subject from the first. Over clause chains but within the same
sentence, semifinites may be interpreted as SS forms only in case the second
clause explains or specifies the first, or in case the two events take place in
sequence and do not overlap. In other same subject conditions, the speaker
needs to use nonfinite SS forms.","[350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355]"

In an article comparing Asmat-Kamoro, Awyu-Dumut and Ok languages,
Voorhoeve writes that “all comparative work involving Awyu-Dumut
languages will find itself restricted to an inventory of maximally 500
words.” (Voorhoeve 2005: 164). As can be seen in the wordlist below,
however, I have managed to collect over 800 lexical entries for Aghu, by
unraveling all the data hidden in Drabbe’s publication.
The wordlist below is a compilation of data from three different sources:
the text corpus, examples given by Drabbe in his grammatical introduction
(most of which are cited in this publication) and the thematic wordlist
provided by Drabbe and presented above. Of those three sources, the text
corpus provides the most reliable data, as it presents the words as used in a
more natural context compared to the words in the other sources, which are
all based on word-by word or sentence-by sentence elicitation.
At one point, the orthography in the list differs from elsewhere in this
publication. It is only in this list that words that end in -mV, where V
indicates a harmonzing vowel, are written as such. At other places in this
publication, I have chosen to follow Drabbe’s orthography, and to write theharmonizing vowel according to how it is realized. Thus, kusumV ‘burp’ is
written as kusumu in the English-Aghu wordlist above, as kusum in the
gloss of 2.096 (where the vowel is elided), and as kusumV in the wordlist
below.
For each lemma, we find, in different fonts and in the order as given below:
the part of speech; then an English gloss;352 then one or more references to352Instead of an English gloss, we sometimes found an abbreviation in capitals, used torefer to a grammatical function of the morpheme, e.g. de OPP. While the grammatical388PART II: WORDLISTS. Aghu-English wordlistoccurences in the text corpus, passages in Drabbe or sections in this
publication; then a reference to the number in the English-Aghu wordlist;
then a reference to semantically or formally related words; and finally an
optional remark. An example is given in the following figure.","[395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406]"
"2.4.3.5 Longer duration, expressed analytically
Drabbe 1957: section 87 p. 35; section 89 p.36According to Drabbe, longer duration can also be expressed analytically.
The examples below are analyzed by Drabbe as a bare stem of a posture
verb followed by the postposition ni, which is analyzed in 3.6.1.1 as a
dative marker.

Drabbe 1957: sections 100-101, page 4181From Drabbe’s description it appears that he considers the final e in mebaxe (etc.) aspart of the stem. In 2.4.3.4, however, the stems were analyzed as consonant-final. The
forms under consideration here may very well be grammaticalized forms of the N1SG
continuative forms, see Table 20. They are not verbal nouns, as these end in a nasal vowel,
also when followed by ni, cf. 2.3.2.2.3 above.",[126]
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes159Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:
(186)efen-etoefen-amoko3SGLNK-father3SGLNK-son‘father and son’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)
(187)efen-amoefen-agã3SGLNK-husband3SGLNK-wife‘husband and wife’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 4.003)
(188)efeküdaefen-ēxo3SGyounger.sibling3SGLNK-elder.brother‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:
(189)ãŋgokuwomanandman‘man and woman’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)3.1.5 Number
Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to160PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesmake clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:
“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,men.””121Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.
As stated above, nouns and noun phrases are generally not specified for
number. In line with Jakobson’s wording we may say that Aghu speakers
do not have to specify nouns and noun phrases for number. In these cases,
it is the linguistic or extralinguistic context which guides the interpretation.
Thus, in (190) and (191) it is knowledge of the world (that is: the
extralinguistic context) which makes that reference is made to a single
river, and to multiple fish traps.","[176, 177, 178]"
"300PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureThe most convincing arguments in favor of ke and te as case markers are
the following. First, Drabbe gives some contrastive examples in which the
markers serve to disambiguate between the syntactic roles of subject and
object. A very convincing example, which was given in 3.1.5 and is
repeated here, is the following:
(523)anan-amset=ed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childNOMgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘my children gave it’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
bnan-amsek=ed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childACCgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)Second, the case markers are in complementary distribution with other case
markers, discussed in 3.6.
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.
cnan-amseed-oxe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childgive-N1.RLS-N1PL‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
(524)nan-amseteda-xe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childNOMcome-N1.RLS-N1PL301‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:
Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauseste, analyzed aske analyzed asIn subject positionNominative case markerFocus markerAs a complementNominative case markerFocus markerConsidering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:
216An interesting example of the use of ke is found in 3.024, which was cited in 4.1 above,example (452).
217Nominal clauses with meoxo as a subject were discussed in 3.2.5.1.","[317, 318, 319]"
"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure277A very good illustration of the optionality of case marking, taken from the
text corpus, is given in (452) below. In the first clause we find two overt
NP’s, neither of them marked for syntactic function (although eke ta has
exclusively been attested in subject position, cf. 3.2.3); apparently, their
function is clear from the context. In clause 2, we find only one overt NP,
in object function, not overtly marked as oblique. In clause 3 we again find
two overt NP’s, an indirect object: efe joxo ‘his brother’ and a direct object:afitamã xabai ‘half a head’. In clause 4, finally, the non-subject role of efe
joxo is marked by the oblique marker ke, for unclear pragmatic reasons.

"134PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: VerbsDrabbe points out that posture verbs are also used to express the concept of
‘possession’. In order to state that a ‘pronominal possessor’ possesses a
‘possessed’, a speaker of Aghu will use a possessive noun phrase asdiscussed in 3.1.2, followed by a posture verb, as illustrated in (157)
through (159) below.
(157)nanamsedeba-xe-nã1SG.POSLNK-childLOCsit-NL.RLS-N1PL‘my children are (sitting) there --> I have children’ (Drabbe 1957:32b)

(159)gabüsiüdee-ke2SG.POShouseLOCstand-N1.RLS[SG]‘your house is (standing) there -> you have a house’ (Drabbe 1957:32b)Posture verbs can have both stative and inchoative readings, 96 and can be
contrasted with a number of verbs that are intrinsically inchoative: xuba(x)
‘sit down’, doto(x) ‘get up from lying position’97, (saŋge-de=k) musu-du=k e(k) [(raise-SS=CON) come.up-SS=CON stand] ‘get up from sitting
into standing position’ and düko(x) ‘lie down’. To this may also be added
the form mese(k) ‘get up from sitting position’, a form that is cited in
section 2.2 and 2.5.
As discussed in 2.4.3.3 above, posture verbs are also used in the formation
of analytic durative constructions, two examples of which are repeated here:96Drabbe speaks of ‘statisch’ and ‘metastatisch’, where metastatisch refers to ‘entering intoa state’.
97To specify whether the getting up leads to a sitting or a standing position, one may useexpressions like doto-do=k ba(x) [get.up -SS=CON sit ] ‘get up into sitting position’ vs.doto-do=k e(k) ‘get up into standing position’.","[151, 152]"

in his discussion of adverbs. 2. Drabbe is not consistent in rendering stress for this word,
which may indicate that it alternates. In this book, the form is consistently rendered asisiomu, except when citing examples provided by Drabbe. 3. Xati seems to indicate the
repetition of an earlier event. It is also used in cases where the same event is performed on
a different object, e.g. in 2.094, where first some moldered wood is brought up, and now
(again / also) a stick. In such cases, we would use 'also' in English, instead of 'again'. This
might be seen as an indication that xati (in these cases) modifies the verb (only the
bringing up is modified), and not the entire clause (which includes the object).","[229, 230]"

flying), while the other animals are thought of as lying or standing,
dependent on whether they are considered as creeping animals or not. An
analogous division between lying and standing applies to objects, and more
research would be needed to find out more about the criteria that make
objects belong to either of these two classes. Fruits on a tree are
conceptualized of as lying, which is also true for dead animals or dead
humans. 9292Whereas animateness also plays a role in the use of continuative_I stems derived fromposture verbs, discussed in 2.4.3.4 above, this role is remarkably different. In these derived
stems, inanimates can only combine with ba-me, and not with me-me and i-me. The use of
these latter two derived verbs is, in other words, restricted to animates.","[148, 149]"

(509)o-xo-neda-despeak-N1.RLS[SG]-DScome-1.RLS[SG]‘he asked me and I came’ (Drabbe 1957:39b)I follow Drabbe in analyzing de as a copula.213 As the number of examples
given by Drabbe is limited, and as we have only few examples of this
construction in the text corpus, it is hard to characterize the precise function
of this construction. It can at least be said that speakers may embed verbal
clauses of different moods, including content questions. In (510)-(512) and
(515) we find realis verbal clauses (serving as an assertion), while (513) is
an example of an embedded irrealis. In (514) we have to do with a (realis)
content question (more on which will be said below). Example (516) and
(517), finally, are examples of embedded imperative clauses. In order to
clarify the structure of the clauses, I have given both a translation that
follows the Aghu structure quite closely, and a more liberal rendering.

few. A clear example is found in the myth on the two brothers, where the

clauses ending in de, it is important to note that the copula here stands in a
paradigmatic relation with negative de xo ‘NEG COP’; with interrogative ka /(a)xajo ‘QST’, and with counterfactual fini oxo ‘CFT COP’, more on which
can be found in 5.5.2. Especially informative is the contrast between open
questions and polar questions. Open questions begin with a question word,
and are optionally embedded in a copula clause ending in de, as illustrated

embedded in clauses ending in ka or (a)xajo, as can be seen in (520)

As was stated in 3.1.7 and 3.6, there are good reasons to analyze te and ke
as case markers. Here I will defend this analysis, but show that they also
have a pragmatic function, which I tentatively describe as ‘focused’. I will
also explain why I analyze ke in certain contexts as a focus marker rather
than a case marker.
expected to take place. The use of ka or axajo puts in question whether the event has taken
place, is taking place or will take place. One might say that the use of de implies a high
degree of authority from the side of the speaker for the truth of the proposition, while polar
questions hand the authority for the truth of the proposition over to the addressee. Cf.
Timberlake (2007: 315f.).
215This is the only case where I have analyzed eke as an accusative; in all other cases ithas been analyzed as a 3SG pronoun plus focus, and glossed as 3SG.FOC; cf. 3.2.3.1.","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317]"
"4.1 Verbal clauses
Drabbe 1957: section 103c, p 42; section 103p-104, p. 43As could be seen in chapter 2, verbal clauses may be headed by nonfinite,
semifinite or finite verbs. I refer to clauses headed by these verbs as272PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structurenonfinite, semifinite and finite clauses, respectively. Only semifinite and
finite clauses may be sentence-final; nonfinite clauses can never be used on
their own, but always need to be followed by another clause.
Following Wester (2014:173) we may define the subject in Aghu as “that
element of reality that is referred to by the person-number marking on the
semifinite or finite verb.” In intransitive clauses, person-number marking
refers to the sole, intransitive, subject-argument (S), as is true for the
inflection on fomeŋgenã in (439). In transitive clauses, person-number
marking refers to the transitive subject or “the most Agent-like argument(A)” (cf. Payne 1997:133), as is the case for the inflection on bēkenã in
(440).","[289, 290]"
"282PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structureNote that most of the verbs listed above have, in addition to the
experiencer, an additional argument that may seem to function as a subject.
In this respect, it is interesting to compare the following pairs:
(457) anukekinoxomi-ke1SGACCtearcome.down-N1.RLS[SG]‘I got tears in my eyes’ (Drabbe 1957:24a)
bjoxotekinoxomi-ke-nã3PLNOMtearcome.down-N1.RLS-N1PL‘They go tears in their eyes (Drabbe 1957:24a)It is very well possible to think of kinoxo in (457) a as the subject. Its status
in the b- example, however, is harder to define. If we consider joxo te as
the subject — which is what I would propose, given its marking asnominative and the agreement with the verb — what then is the status ofkinoxo? I will leave this question for further research.
While the verbs described so far obligatorily behave as experiential verbs,
the language also has a number of verbs where the use of an experiential
construction is optional. Drabbe gives only one expression as an
illustration, presenting the following alternation:
(458) anügukunuŋgi-d-oã/nügukunuŋgi-ke1PLfatiguebecome-1.RLS-1PL1PLfatiguebecome-n1.RLS[SG]‘we are sleepy’ (Drabbe 1957:24a)In the text corpus no examples of experiential constructions were found.","[299, 300]"
"The language has different words for different types of carrying, In a strict sense, kēkũseems to refer to a carrying on the shoulders, cf. the Aghu-English wordlist, and 1.237. A
common expression for ‘carry along’ is he combination of a ‘take’ with a directional verb,
cf. 344-346 above and section 3.5.1.1, esp. the rightmost columns of Table 47 and Table
48.

"PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations3095.2 Basic observations
(1) Nonfinite verbs are virtually always followed by a clause with same
subject; 221 they never form the final verb of a clause chain or
sentence. The use of nonfinite verbs was briefly explained in
2.3.2.1, and will be discussed in more detail in 5.4.1.1.
(2) Within a clause chain, an asyndetic sequence of bare semifinite
verbs with same subject is very rare. Stated differently, an asyndetic
sequence of bare semifinite verbs has the strong implication that the
following clause has a different subject. If we combine observation
(1) and (2), we may state that clause chains are the domain of a
rudimentary switch reference system (further explained in 5.4
below).
(3) Within a clause chain, -ne and -ku are used as markers of
sequentiality and switch reference. They combine with semifinites or
imperatives.
a. According to Drabbe, the use of -ku implies that the
following clause has the same subject. The use of -ku seems
very rare or restricted to specific genres, as the text corpus
contains no examples of the use of -ku. The use of -ku is
further explained in 5.4.2.1.
b. According to Drabbe, the use of -ne implies that the
following clause has a different subject. This is confirmed in
our corpus, as will be shown in 5.4.2.2.","[326, 327]"

3.1 Nouns and noun phrasesAghu has very few morphological processes operating on nouns. The only
ones are: (1) plural suffixation, on a very restricted set of kinship terms and
nouns denoting humans (3.1.5.1), and (2) suffixation with a possessive
linker, on vowel-initial nouns in possessive constructions (3.1.2; 3.2.2).
There are no productive processes of noun formation, except from
compounding, which is the topic of the following section.1073.1.1 Compounding

following figure. In both constructions, the modifying noun has main

languages.","[161, 162, 163]"
