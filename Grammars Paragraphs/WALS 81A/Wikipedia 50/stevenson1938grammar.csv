FORMATION OF MOODS lllill TEfI§;8S.
From the foregoing paradigms it will be seen that all moods

Singular.
Verbs which are formed from different stems are

Irregularities in other verbs will be noted as they
occur.
In regular verbs, if the Present, singUlar is knovm, any Person
in any mood or tense may be ascertained.
