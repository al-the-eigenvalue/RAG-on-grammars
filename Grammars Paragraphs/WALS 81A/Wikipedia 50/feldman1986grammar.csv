"( 1 ) Although sub j ects never bear case marking, there are other nouns that may
occur in the c lause that never bear case marking e i ther ( c f . 6 . 1 and 5 . 4 ) .
( 2 ) Obj ect marking is obl i gatory on some di rect obj ects and optional on others
(cf. 6 . 2 ) .
( 3 ) Although indirect obj ects always bear obj ect marking , certain direct
obj ects do so too ( c f . 6 . 2 ) .
Furthermore , a lthough Awtuw ' s basic word order is readily identifiable as verb
fina l , indeed as 50V, as order and other permutations are far too common to
allow word order to be of any value in ident ifying grammatical relations .
It is possibl e , nevertheless , to i solate the three relations on the basis of a
more complicated s tatement of their case marking properties in combination with
other criteria . It is important to be able to identi fy grammatical relations
on formal grounds. and without re ference to verb semantics because the
classif icat ion of verbs in section 5 . 2 relies on the ir abi lity to co-occur with
NPs in various grammatical relations .",[93]
"CHAPTER 7STRUCTURE OF THE NOUN PHRASEAwtuw word order is , on the whole , very free . Where the constraints are most
rigid is within the Noun Phras e . This chapter describes the constituents of
the NP , their possibilities of co-occurrence , their orde r , and the permis sible
permutations of canonical orde r .","[121, 122]"
"2.2Mo rphophono l o gyThis section presents a number of ordered rules which together produce most o f
the phonetic forms of Awtuw words from strings of morphemes .
On the whole , the rules apply to verb forms , but where other types of words
meet the environmental criteri a , these rules affect them as wel l . The only
cases o f such rules are one of the vowel harmony rules ( 2 . 2 . 10) , which changes
the canonical lei of the past , future , and obj ect suf f ixes to lrJ or [�J, and
the pre-rhotic stop insertion rule in 2 . 2 . 18 .",[22]
"6. 1Unmarked c a s eThe Sub j ect of the clause , as identi fied above in section 5 . 1 , is always
unmarked .

Miytiy NEG short man
3MS tal l man very
Miytiy isn ' t a short man, he 's a very tal l manAs we saw in Chapter 5 , any Obj ect , including the recipient of a bitransitive
verb or the bene fic iary of a verb with benefactive · marking , may accept Object
mark ing . This section will examine under what circumstances Object marking is
obl igatory , and under what circumstances it is optional .
I n order to describe the relative tendencies of NPs to bear Object marking , we
must first develop an Empathy hierarchy . NPs conforming to the type s to the
left are higher in empathy than those to the right . Object NPs of the highest
empathy a lways take Obj ect marking . Tho se of the lowest empathy ra re ly take
Obj ect marking , and those in between have a greater or lesser propensity to
take i t . This depends particularly upon whether o r not the object N P is
de finite , and the relative empathy of the object and the sub j ect . The
conditions under which obj ect NPs take Object marking are di scussed in de tai l
in section 6 . 2 .
[ PRO ] > [ prN ] > [ +HUMAN ] > [ +ANIMATE ] > [ -ANIMATE ]F i g u re 6 . 1
The Object of a clause is optiona lly marked when it is lower in empathy than
the Subj ect ( c f . 6 . 2 ) . Consequently , low-empathy Common noun Objects are
frequently unmarked .","[113, 114]"

The ye l ow/y i ma y reflexive construction has a very low functional load - there
are no examples whatsoever in the corpus of narrative I have collecte d . This
is in part because in many of the cases where one might expect frequent
reflexivisation , for example with a verb l ike �QrY� wash , the reflexive is
lexical ised , in this ins tance by y i w l Y�� water bathe .

The examples i n ( 3 8 ) illu strate these two meanings .

hairy(d)yen kay- neney
husband-y
married (of woman)Another important function of thi s suffix is to take up the s lack left by
Awtuw ' s closed class of adj ectives . Unl ike many other languages with closed
adj ective classes , many of the gaps in the inventory of basic adj ectival50
meanings are filled not by nouns or verbs ( cf . Schachter to appear p . 1S ) , but
rather by derived adj ectives with - n eney .

the two a llomorphs appears to be lexically conditioned . Perhaps most important
among these is the derivation of colour terms . Section 1 1 . 2 contains further
discussion of colour terminology .

greenExamples ( 40a) and ( 40b) il lustrate the derivation of ad j ectives from nouns and
( 40c) il lustrate s the derivation of an adj ective from another adj ective .
Another important function of this suffix is to derive an extremely common
adj ective .

demonstratives , and other adverbs .

-wcew DUAL and -worn PLURAL and on Place names and most common nouns and
adj ectives in the case of ycen i rn GENERIC . All three of these have the pecu l iar
property of deriving a form with some of the morphological character istics of a
personal pronoun from a noun . Both the di stribution of the number markers and
the morphological properties of personal pronouns rece ive fuller discussion in
section 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 . But briefly , where nouns may not take the possessive
suffix - ke , nouns bearing the number markers may . Where a subclass of nouns
may take the locative suffix - a / - ka , nouns with number marking may not . And
where nouns take one of the allomorphs of the object marker beginning with a
consonant , number-marked nouns take the al lomorphs consisting of a vowe l alone .
-CHAPTER 4V E RBAL MORPHOSYNTAX4. 1Structure o f the verb compl exMany o f the aff ixes discussed in this chapter have already appeared in section
2 . 2 . There I was concerned with the changes phonemes undergo in the presence
of other spec i fied phonemes and boundaries in the verb complex and elsewhere .
Here , I descr ibe the formal morphological simi larities and differences among
verbs , the co-occurrence of affixes , and the meanings and functions of the
affixe s . I llustrative paradigms are to be found at the end of this chapter .
We can begin by examining a few highly expanded forms of typical verbs to
i l lustrate the overall structure of the verb complex and the order of the
elements that it compr ises . For the sake of intel ligibility , I wi l l f irst
display a table o f the slots i n the verb complex and the affixes that may f i l l
them , and then present the evidence for the analys i s . with the exception o f
slot +1 , the l i s t s o f affixes for each slot are exhaustive . I discuss the
aff ixes that occur in slot +1 fully in section 4 . 1 2 .
Co-occurrence restrictions make three examples neces sary to i l lus trate the
relative order of a f f ixes in all slots . I will discuss these in subsequent
section s .
Example ( 1 ) shows the relative order o f a f f ixes i n s lots -8 , - 7 , - 6 , - 5 , -4 ,
- 3 , 0 , +1 , +2 , and +5 .

of non-adj acent affixe s .","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
"9 . 4 . 2 Awtuw uses four other focusing strategie s , a l l o f them much rarer than
po . The simplest of the se is topicali sation , which entails e xtracting the
focused constituent with a pause between the extracted constituent and the rest

Othe rwise , constituents in a WH -que stion have the same freedom of order as they
do in other types of c lauses . In particular, there is no requirement , though
there may be a slight tendency , for the interrogative to occur clause initially .

"9 . 1 . 1 While each word stress in a declarative sentence is uttered at approxi­
mately the same pitch , in a yes-no que stion , the last word stre ss in the clause
is appreciably higher in pitch than the others and the pitch of any syllable s

But we will need to apply another substitution test to identify pronominal and
personal name direct obj ects in clauses wi th common noun subj ects , in other words ,
where the direct ob j ect is higher in empathy than the subj ect . In such clauses ,
pronominal and personal name direct obj ects take obligatory object marking and
are therefore indi stinguishable from indirect obj ects on formal grounds wi thout
reference to information about the meaning of the verb . We cannot substi tute a
human common noun , because it will nece s sarily be equal to or higher than the
sub j ect in empathy , and therefore still require object marking . Thus we can
substitute a non-human common noun for the pronoun or personal name in que s tion .
If the substituted common noun s t i l l requires ob ject marking , then it must be
an indirect obj ect . If the clause is acceptable whether the substituted common
noun bears object marking or not , then i t i s a direct ob j ect .

Note that ( 1 2b-d) are grammatical whether or not the direct ob ject ( p i y ren in

ungrammatical when the indirect obj ect is unmarked , as il lustrated in ( 1 2e ) .","[95, 96]"

1. 1PrefaceThe data upon which I base the description presented here was collected in the
course of a field trip of 15 months' duration' (November 1979 February 1 9 8 1 )
in the village of Kamnum, the largest of the five Awtuw-speaking villages .
Insofar as possible I have gleaned examples from a small corpus of narrative
text. But I have also used elicited examples to illustrate points where
necessary.
The content and structure of this description rest on a number of assumptions
which I will attempt to make explicit.
-1 . 1 . 1 Language is a singularly prominent facet of culture in that it serves as
the main repository and channel of communication of culture. But there are
areas of linguistic structure that may in most cultures be described
conveniently and without significant distortion as discrete from other aspects
of culture.
within the domain that is nuclear to language, there are a number of structural
components that mediate between meanings to be conveyed and the acoustic code
through which they are transmitted. These components are the proper subject of
linguistic description.
1 . 1 . 2 The physical properties of the acoustic code are marginal to linguistic
description. Similarly, the nature of the relations between expressible
meanings and cognitive processes on the one hand and external reality on the
other, are marginal to the description of linguistic structure.
within this periphery are three main structural components. The phonological
component mediates between meaningful forms and the acoustic code through which
they are transmitted. The lexical component mediates between lexical forms and
expressible meanings. And the grammatical component organises the composition
and combination of lexical forms , mediating, as it were , between the other two
components .
Viewed in this way, the grammatical component is central to linguistic structure.
I intend here to present a comprehensive, even if not exhaustive , description
of the morphology, syntax, and morphosyntax of Awtuw. Because Awtuw is a
previously undescribed language, I include information on aspects of the
language peripheral to my main concerns. Specifically, Chapter 1 places the1Feldman, H. A grammar of Awtuw.

Because of the nature of the equative relation , the subject and predicate of an
Equative clause are interchangeable . Posses sive and Comparative predicates may
precede the ir subj ects with a change in intonation , as in examples ( 20 f ) and
( 20g)

There i s one final predication type that bears some resemblance to some of the
Idiomatic Composite constructions described above ( c f . 5 . 9 ) , on the one hand ,
and to the verble ss body part constructions ( c f . 8 . 3 . 1 ) , on the othe r . All
such predicates denote Cognitive state s .
8 . 7 . 1 Two of the four predicates may be regarded as participating in more or
less straightforward Ascriptive predications that happen to take complements

nenffin thought occupies the same position in the nenffin l§� construction as do
nouns in other predicates of the same type . Its abi l ity to take - neney he re
provides further evidence for be l ieving ne nffin to be a noun . The adj ective­
deriving suffix on neknek in example ( 2 2 ) suggests that i t may be a noun
denoting ' knowledge ' . But as the next example i l lustrates , neknek can occur8. 7 . 2141
as the predicate without derivation or any verb with which t o partic ipate in a
composite construction , making the gloss ' knowledge ' appear most improbable and
casting doubt upon its part -o f - speech a f f i l iation .

marker - m . It cannot even take - neney , as neknek and ne n�n can , nor can it
modify a noun attributively . I will not speculate further upon its part -of­
speech membership , but simply exempli fy its use .

di stingui shed from declarative clau ses by a change in intonation contour .
Alternative questions are formed by postposing the particle yok r i perhaps to
each alternative . wH-questions are formed by substituting one of the set o f
interrogative s , which begin with I y l in Awtuw , for a constitue nt .","[144, 145, 146, 147, 148]"
"The answer to a WH-question will ordinarily consist of the word that wi l l most
suitably replace the interrogative in the question . When the interrogative
bears case marking , the answer too wi l l usually have it , even if the answer
consists of only a single word . It is common , though not quite as common as
in answers to alternative questions , for the particle po to focus the answer .

(I gave food) to Yawur9.2Nega t i o nAwtuw has two basic negation strategie s . The negative prefix ka - / kiIl- may f i l l
the f i r s t s lot in the verb complex t o negate any verbal predicate . And the
negative particle y e n e may negate any constituent , inc luding a predicate
nominal or adj ective , a verb , or even a negative verb , that it precede s .",[151]
"5 . 1 . 3 In summary , then , I define the three identifiable grammatical relations
as follows :
( 1 ) The subj ect is that NP that never takes obj ect marking , even when
pronominal , that triggers person and number agreement on the verb , that is the
obligatory antecedent of an emphatic pronoun , and that may occur as the direct
obj ec t of the matrix clause in di rect perception constructions .
( 2 ) The direct object i s the NP that takes optional object marking when i t i s
a common noun and when i t s referent is lower in empathy than , o r less l ikely to
have performed the action than , the subj ect .",[96]
"72The other plural s lot , +6 , may b e f i l led o n any verb that has tense , but not
Condi t ional , marking . The presence or absence of Plural marking in slot +3 has
no e ffect on the abi l i ty of verbs with tense marking to have s lot +6 fu l l .

and they may trigger number agreement in s lot +6 if the verb has tense marking .
I f the verb has both aspect and tense marking , then either or both s lots may be
f i l led . The option always remains for the verb to display no number markin g .","[77, 78]"
"5 . 2 . 2 To complete the basic classification , we may further di stinguish two
types of trans itive verbs - those that occur with an indirect object , and those
that may only do so when marked with the Benefactive suffix .",[97]

of the e l i gible morphemes can co-occur in the same verb complex . I have chosen
to place the entire class o f morphemes in the same s lot , rather than three
separate slot s , because any of the e ligible morphemes would be able to occupy
any of the s lot s , as long as no s ingle morpheme occurs more than once . And
final l y , seven of the morphemes are identical or nearly identical in form to a
verb root that occurs independently. I t is for thi s reason that I have
designated the slot a Compound slot. Another factor that has contributed to
this deci sion is the semantic diversity that the morpheme s in this class
d i splay. They range from the Benefactive suffix -kow which increases the
valence of the verb it i s attached to , through the aspectual-l ike I nchoative
suffix - tffiwa , to such apparently lexical and adverbial meanings as - a t a in
order to detain someone .
Every member of this class of morphemes is of a phonological shape plausible
for a verb root , i . e . they end in a consonant or /a/ , and it i s l ike ly that
this construction has ari sen diachronically from a very tightly-bound verb
serialisation . As the seriali sation crystall ised into suffixation , some o f the
verbs which could participate in the seriali sation have ceased to occur as
independent verb s , and a few have not yet done so .
The suffixes that can f i l l this slot may conveniently be divided into semantic
c lasses wh ich I label Grammatical , ' pretend ' Aux i l iary , Aspectual , Quantitative ,
Adverbia l , Consecutive , and Obstructive .",[81]
"In bitransitive clause s , the I ndirect Obj ect takes Obj ect marking obligatorily .
Indirect Objects are almost invariably Pronouns or Personal Name s . But Common
noun Indirect Obj ects do not have the same freedom to occur unmarked as do
Direct Objects and it was for thi s reason that I recognised the category in 5 . 1 .
I t follows that pronominal Indirect Obj ects wi ll invariably take Obj ect marking .

language in its social and sociolinguistic context, Chapter 2 provides an
overview of Awtuw's rich phonological and morphophonological system, Chapter
examines the structure of a few lexical fields of general interest, and Chapter
12 describes some paralinguistic phenomena.
111 . 1 . 3 The aims and methodology of linguistic theory and of linguistic
description are fundamentally different. The aim of theory is to delimit and
explain the functions of language in human society and human cognition. Its
methodology must therefore be to establish a set of explanatory principles that
will generate hypotheses about linguistic functions and the ways that languages
can express them. These hypotheses can then be tested against empirical data
about languages.
The aim of linguistic description is to identify the formal classes, categories ,
and structures of a language on empirical , language-internal evidence. Its
methodology must therefore be to examine and analyse such evidence and to
correlate the formal properties so isolated with their semantic functions.
In other words, it must describe language from the addressee's perspective
decoding forms into meanings, rather than from the speaker's perspective
encoding meanings into forms.
This is not to insist that every identifiable form is necessarily in a one-to­
one correspondence with a single meaning; we often encounter examples of
polysemy or structural ambiguity. But, as a heuristic, we do not expect a
mUltiplicity of forms to correspond to a single semantic category.
1 . 1 . 4 The approach taken in this description is therefore essentially
structuralist. I assume the utility of binary features and relative markedness
in distinguishing categories at all levels of structure. I further assume that
features used in a description should correspond to empirically identifiable
categories. Whenever possible, I have attempted to establish a correspondence
between formal categories and plausible semantic categories .
A feature-based analysis has two advantages . Features often cross-classify
such that a small set of formal/functional properties can distinguish a large
number of categories . It is also possible to make certain kinds of generalis­
ations regarding the properties of marked and unmarked categories.
For example, in the analysis of tense marking in Chapter 4, the feature
NONPRESENT at the same time distinguishes Present forms from Past forms, Future
from Desiderative, and Conditional from Frustrative. It also identifies the
morphologically unmarked Present with the semantically unmarked category of
non-NONPRESENT.
Throughout this description, I have aimed to express significant generalisations
intelligibly. When it seemed to further this aim, have borrowed formalisms
from Generative theory. I do not mean this to imply any credence in the claims
of the theory. The formalisms merely represent a handy and familiar convention
for schematising certain types of generalisations.
When a language is described in accordance with these principles, the hypotheses
generated by theory can be tested against the description. I have attempted
therefore to present an analysis that is empirically-based and relatively
theoretically neutral , and that reflects the structure of the language
faithfully.

between 142°29 ' and 142°3 1 ' East longitude and 3°3 4 ' and 3°3 6 South latitude in
an area of about 30 square kilometres in the southern foothills of the
Torricelli Range in north-western Papua New Guinea (see Map 1 ) . All five
villages are administered as part of the South-west Wapei Census Division of
the Lumi District, Sandaun (West Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea.
The five Awtuw-speaking villages are located at altitudes ranging from 3 2 0 to
400 metres above sea-level. Rainfall in Kamlakwlape, recorded from May to
December 1980 , ranged from a low of 7 1 . 5mm in June to a high of 2 3 7 . 7mm in
December. Temperatures range from 19 . 4° to 3 2 . 2° Celsius, with an average of
2 2 . 2° at 0600 and 29 . 4° at 1500 daily, with no appreciable seasonal variation.
Table 1.1 lists the five villages with their vernacular names, their names in
Tok Pisin, their populations in 1980 , and the names of the component hamlets.

the data it is based upon belong to the Awtuw speaking people of Kamlakwlape,
Wutlakwlape , Wiyuplape , Tupumlape, and Kalaktuwlape .
I am most deeply indebted to the people of Meleylape , who allowed me to live in
their hamlet for fifteen months, who helped me in many ways, and who patiently
taught me their language . Among those who were most forthcoming were Yowmen,
Takiy, Poliw, Altiy, Awkay, Awtiy, Eykiy, Kampo, Keriy, Mimpel , Momoy, Naytow,
Osiy, Ruwmay, Wawpey, Yinow, Napeyre, Nimpiy. I am particularly grateful to
Kewmaey, Yawur, Yakop, and Napeyre, who allowed me to tape their narratives and
to Peyaw, Mimpel, and Ruwmay, who dictated stories to me . There is no way that
I can ever repay my debt to Yawur and Yakop, who helped me to transcribe texts
and provided virtually all of the elicited material I have used.
I am also grateful to the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies, the Department
of Language at the University of Papua New Guinea, the Sandaun Provincial
Government, the Lumi District Office, and Kewmaey, Councillor for the Awtuw­
speaking area, for their permission to study Awtuw.
A large number of people deserve my thanks for the accommodation they so
graciously provided. Wietze Baron accommodated me at Ukarumpa. Paul of the
Lumi Police Detachment, Ian Bagley and other staff at Lumi High School , Father
Terry and others at St Mary' s Catholic Mission, and Kewmaey allowed me to stay
in their houses in Lumi . And Brian McClintock put me up in Port Moresby.
Leo Yimiten and Lumi District Office Staff helped me in a variety of ways and
made the 1980 census data available to me .
Val Lyon of the Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts at the Australian
National University was kind enough to draw the map.
Ger Reesink, Wietze Baron, Ken McElhanon, Les Bruce, and Dave Scorza of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (PNG Branch) discussed my proposed fieldwork
with me and provided me with access to some unpublished material in their
library.
Don Laycock, Cecil Brown, Bill Mitchell , and Keith Thomas corresponded with me
and encouraged me while I was in the field.
I would also like to thank Avery Andrews , Cliff Goddard, Ian Green, Walter
Seiler, Tim Shopen and David Wilkins for discussing my work with me, and Cliff
and David in particular for their valuable comments on draft chapters .
The Australian National University provided me with a generous scholarship
which made it possible to undertake this project at all .
Finally, my gratitude to Tanya and Adam McConvell for their support and
encouragement is unbounded.

1 . The subordinate verb in any nominal construction may optionally bear the
suffix - re o As I wi ll discuss in section 10 . 3 , verbs in adverbial cons tructions
may bear the suffix - re - k . The se two suffixes are homophonous with the obj e ct
and instrumental/comitative case markers , respectively ( see Chapter 6 ) .
While a number o f the constructions di scussed in this section are , in fact ,
direct object complements , it i s interesting that subj ect complement s , although
marginal , may take - re , as shown in section 10 . 2 . 4 . Relative clauses may also
take this suf fix . It would appear therefore that this case marker has been at
least partially reanalysed a s a subo�dination marker . But since - re retains
its obj e ct-marking function in many case s , I wi l l continue to gloss it as such .
There i s no convincing evidence that the Instrumental/Comitative suffix has
undergone a similar reana lysi s .

with an obligatory , lexically specified noun which may not accept object

verbs intersects the categories o f transitivity . Most of the verbs in this
class depict intransitive bodily processes . Often the complementary noun
resembles an ' internal accusative ' in that its meaning does not contribute to
the meaning of the composite because the verb root alone conveys the whole
meaning and there i s no apparent derivational relationship between the noun and

verb may be the first in such a compound , the second and subsequent roots are
se lected from a clo sed set of about 30 member s . About a third of the members
of this set may themselves function as independent verb roots in meanings
reasonably closely re lated to the meanings they express in a compound . The
balance bear no phono logical resemblance to any independent verb root , although
they al l have a phonologica l shape that would be plausible for one .
The morphemes that may occur as the second and subsequent components of such a
compound range in meaning from �2� give , which marks verbs with a benefactive
argument , through aspectual meanings l ike ! ��� begin and �2 � � � comp le te ly ,

There is no apparent correlation between the independence of the morpheme and
the independence of its meaning from that of the matrix verb root . Thus , kow
the bene factive marker , which has the most clearly ' grammatical ' meaning of the49
morphemes in this set , is among the commonest verbs in the language used

range from the strategy described in section 3 . 7 . 3 and 4 . 14 , which fuses roots
within a single verb complex , to strateg ie s that con join clauses with separate
sets of NPs and complete ly independent speci fication for verbal categories .
This chapter describe s the forma l properties of each construction and re lates
them to the ir semantic functions .
The constructions fall into five di stinct categorie s . Serial isation construc­
t ions concatenate verb roots , verb forms , or verb phrases whose subj ects are
obl igatorily co-referential to code diverse semantic functions ranging from an
increase in valency to a sequence of actions .
Nominal constructions subordinate a verb phrase or a full c lause as a
constituent of an NP per forming a nominal or ad j ectival function. In these
constructions , the tense of the subordinate verb is e ither determined by the
construction or interpreted as relative to the tense of the matrix verb .
Nominal constructions code a variety of relations ranging from so-called psych­
action complements , such as ' remembe r to . . . ' , to cause clause s , inc luding
re lative c lause s .
Adverbial constructions code actions contemporaneous or sequential to the
action coded by the matrix verb . They are formally similar to nominal
constructions in some respect s . But where a nominal clause is marked a s
subordinate with the suffix - re , a n adverbial clause bears the suf fix - rek .
Moreover , the subject of an adverbial clause may not occur as the obj e c t o f
the matrix clause , a s is possible in certain nominal constructions . And an
adverbial clause functions adverbial ly rather than nominally or adj ectivally .
Condi tional constructions j uxtapose two interdependent clause s which must bear
identical future or conditional marking .
Co-ordination constructions j uxtapose two or more entirely independent clauses
to code simultaneous , consecutive , and unspecified re lations among predicate s .","[155, 156, 157, 158]"

intransitive verbs or not and whether it is the subj ect or the obj ect of the
trans itive verb that becomes the subj ect of the intransitive verb .
Verb Morphology does not reflect these derivations . It is only through the
argument structure of the pred ications the verb participates in that the
derivation becomes apparent .
Some transitive verbs do not der ive corre sponding intransitive verbs at all .
A deleted subj ect or obj ect can only be interpreted as anaphoric or irre levant .
Because these verbs are always transitive , I call them card inal transit ive
verbs .

resemblance to the class of English verbs that Lyons ( 1 968 : 3 59-360) calls
' causative ' verbs . I am therefore adopting his term for the corresponding
class of Awtuw verbs .

"5.2Maj o r c l a s se s o f verb roo tsA number of factors conspire to compl icate the classification of Awtuw verb
roots on strictly formal ground s . First , a l l verbs , with a few exceptions
discussed i n section 4 . 14 , have prec isely the same properties with regard to
the affixes they may bear . Second , the four con j ugation c lasses described in
section 4 . 1 3 do not correlate with any other grammatical or semantic categorie s .
And third , many contexts permit , or even require , the deletion o f NPs .
The analysis I present here w i l l rest heavily on the number of NPs that co-occur
with various verb roots and what the i r grammatical relation is to the verb .
The first thing to notice is that no verb root in Awtuw always occurs without
an accompanying NP . NPs may be deleted in e l l iptical contexts to leave a verb
form alone in a clause , but i n unmarked , out-of-the-blue contexts , a l l Awtuw
verbs have at least one accompanying NP .
Before embarking on the analys i s it is important to point out that the
Benefactive marker - kow- may be suff ixed to a wide variety of verb roots .
This suffix increases the valency of the verb so that it may co-occur with a
bene ficiary NP in addi tion to any NPs that they otherwise co-occur with . I n
establ ishing the basic classification of verbs , therefore , I will be considering
only those that do not bear thi s suffix .
Final ly , it is appropriate at thi s stage to define the verb phrase as the
constituent that includes :
- a verb form ,
- any NP e l igible to bear Obj ect marking , ( c f . 5 . 7 and 6 . 1- 2 ) ,
- the goal or source NP with a Direction verb ( c f . 5 . 3 . 1 and 5 . 4 . 1 ) ,
- the source NP with the verb ka ( c f . 5 . 4 . 1 and 6 . 4 ) .",[97]

a place , . i . e . a place name , a direction , or denotes some physical locality ,
e . g . a house , a road, a river, a part of a house o r a tree , etc . It also marks
the location of a state , process , or action , again provided that the NP refers
to a place . The meaning of the as sociated verb determines the interpretation
of Locative NP as e i ther location or direction , and if direction , whether
from or to . Thus , unless the clause contains a Direction verb , the Locative NP
wil l refer to a location . I f the clause contains the verb �y go , one of the
other Goal verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) or a seriali sation with �y , then the Locative NP
wil l refer to a goal . And i f the clause contains the verb �y� come , one of the
other Source verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) , or a seriali sation ending in �y� , then the
Locative will be a source . There are a number of ' location ' nouns that commonly
compound with other nouns to make the reference of the Locative more explicit
( c f . 3 . 7 . 2 ) . The fol lowing list includes all such nouns that have come to my
attention .","[119, 120]"

syntactic ground s . Each of them , when transitive , depicts a n action with a
more or less clearly defined end point , and typically results in a state .
When intransitive , they depict a s i tuation where the subject undergoes a
process with a definable end point .
Many causative verbs have lexical ly speci fied obj ects , o r a very small class of
permis sible obj ects . Table 5 . 8 lists a number of the verbs in thi s clas s ,

"10. 2 . 2Fu ture compl ement c o n s truc t i o n sThe first three constructions we w i l l b e examining require a verb with future
marking in the nominal clause . These constructions express desire or lack o f
de sire t o d o something , remembering or forgetting to do something , asking o r
tell ing someone t o d o some thing , and purpose . I n each case , the future -marked
verb depicts an action that must take place after the situation depicted by the
matrix verb . This make s the future marking seem semantically natural .
1 . In one o f the se , the covert subj ect o f the nominal clause must be
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the matrix c lause . Although Awtuw lacks an
infinitive form , this bears a close resemblance to an infinitive construction .
In thi s construction , the future verb functions as the complement o f the othe r
verb , as s ignalled by the Obj ect suffix. The Obj e ct-marked verb may have an
obj ect of its own , but it has no overt subj ect as it is neces sarily
co-re ferential with the subj ect of the other verb.
There is a l imited class of roots that can occur as the matrix verb in this
construction , speci fically , a subset of the cognition verbs . This class
include s the two preference verbs , rewrey l � � like and ���� don ' t like, don ' t
want when they mean like/want to and not like/want to .

Fami ly . He further classif ies this fami ly within the Upper Sepik Super-stock
of the Sepik Sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu Phylum . Whi le the postulated broader
relationships are tentative , there is little doubt that the three Ram Fami ly
languages are c losely related ( c f . Laycock and Z ' Graggen 1977 , Wurm 197 1 ) .
Karawa , with some 53 speakers , is spoken in the vi llage of Bulawa , directly
south of the Awtuw-speaking area , and Bouye , with some 642 speakers , is spoken
in the villages of Giliato , Maurom , Wokien , and Yukilo to the south-west ( see
Map 1 ) .
1 . 2 . 3 Most reports of patrols through the area prior to World War II were
destroyed in air attacks on the administrative centre of Aitape . Some of those
that survive indicate that patrols were conducted near , but probably not
through , the Awtuw-speaking region in the early- to mid-1930s ( McCarthy 193 1 ,
1936- 3 7 , Robinson 1931-34 , c f . Marshal l 1 9 3 7 , 1 9 3 8 ) .
Prior to contact and the establishment of government control over the area ,
there was sporadic fighting among the villages in the area . The most recent
series of conf l i cts , which ended in a permanent armistice around 1950 , involved
the vil lages of Kamlakw and Wiyup on the one side , and Nalpetlape ( Taute) and
Wilkilape (Wi lki l i ) on the othe r .
B y the t ime of World War II , Awtuw speakers were regularly contracting t o do
plantation labour and some served in the armed forces during the war . The
Japanese crossed the Torricellis in the course of the invasion and were
certainly in the village of Se inim, but apparently fai led to penetrate as far
south as Kamlakwlape or Wutlakwlape .
In 1948 , the Franciscan order established their mission at Lumi , the nearest
airstrip to the Awtuw-speaking area , about three and a half hours ' walk north­
east of Kamlakwlape . The government established a patrol post there the
fo llowing year and the Christian Missions in Many Lands ( CMML ) , a Brethren
mission , also set up their mission at Lumi in 1949 . The two missions competed
with each other for the souls of the people in the surrounding area , but
eventually divided the area to their mutual satisfact ion . Don and Ai leen
MacGregor , a CMML couple from New Zealand , staffed the Lumi mission , probably
from its inception , unt i l Don ' s death in 1976 . During this time , Don wrote a
number of papers on the culture of the Wapei people ( MaCGregor 1969 , 1972 ,
1974a , 1974b, 1 9 7 5 ) , and , in collaboration with Ai leen , a sketch of 010 grammar
and a glossary of 010 , a Torricelli Phylum language ( MacGregor and MacGregor
198 2 ) .
In 195 7 , Ken Knight , of the Sola Fide Mission , established himself and his
party of seven to nine people in what is now Me leylape . The hamlet was
inhabited at the time , but since the Knights wanted to bui ld their compound
there , the Meley people moved to a nearby spot on the track to Wutlakw . The
Knights compensated the people thus displaced with a payment of one pound .
The Knights ran a school and a clinic at Meley and left in 1961 for reasons
which I have not been able to determine . The Sola Fide Mission sti ll exists ,
with headquarters in Goroka EHP .
After the Knights ' party left , the CMML took over responsibility for Kamlakw
and the surrounding area . Don MacGregor visited frequently to conduct services .
In the mid- 1960s , the CMML sent a school teacher to Kamlakw , but the hamlet
decided to expel him after a year because they considered him excessively cruel
to the chi ldren .","[9, 10, 11]"

verb . In fact , the form that I cite as the root , � ���y is probably a
crystalised imperfective stem formed from a root � and the imperfective
circumfix - k - -ey .
If this conj ecture is correct , then the initial vowe l would
have ari sen from an epenthetic vowel regu larly inserted between the factive
prefix d- and the prefix component of the imperfective circumf ix - k - and a
regular w-metathesis rule would have reversed the order of the - k - and the -w- .
The future form , w-owkey - re , which occurs only rare l y , demonstrates that the
form is indeed crystalised because the regular future imperfective of a root �
would have to be * ka -w-ey- re . There wou ld be no factive prefix , the non-factive
prefix w- would be deleted before the - k - , and there would be no epenthetic
vowel before the -k- to accept stress and condition w-metathesi s . The past
tense form , d - awkey- e , i s much more common . The root appears very often in the
Debitive wan-owkey . A l l three of these are formal ly regular for a root �� �� y .
But the root occurs most frequently in a defective imperfective form unmarked
for tense , d - awkey , sometimes with the Absentive prefix wa- , yielding
da-w- awkey .
Like � � ��y , l �lY stay , live , be a live resembles an imperfective stem .
But here if we were to assign the - k - and the - i y to the imperfective circumfix,
the verb would most likely have to be derived from a root with the canonical
form 0, and it i s difficult to see how a O- root could condition the - i y
allomorph of the imperfective suffix . I t seems more probable that l � l Y derives
from the imperfective of l� sit .","[89, 90, 91]"

"42
Wurm ( 1 9 7 7 a ) has drawn attention to a remarkable consistency among the diverse
languages of New Guinea in the forms of certain personal pronouns . Examining
the s ingular forms in all three persons and the first and second person plural s ,
h e finds that most of the pronouns marking these categories throughout New
Guinea fall into one of three basic sets and that a given language wi l l often
select most of its pronouns from the same set or in a predictable way from two
or a l l three set s . Because the pronominal forms in a given set crop up over a
geographically large area and in no way restrict themselves to s ingle genetic
groupings , Wurm concludes that personal pronouns are , contrary to popular
opinion , commonly borrowed from language to language .
Awtuw ' s personal pronouns are quite consi stent in their set membership . The
second person plural form bears no resemblance to the pronouns in any of the
sets Wurm has establ i shed . But the other four categories a l l display Set I
feature s .
One of the postulated Set I forms for third person singular i s / te / , which
resembles the corresponding female form in Awtuw quite c losely . There i s a l so
a predictable consonant alternation , character istic of Set I pronouns signal l ing
the gender distinction in the third person s ingular . A property of second
person s i ngular forms in Set l aX appears to end in a coronal consonant and
begin with a /y/ , as does the Awtuw form /ye n / . S imilar l y , Set I first person
forms typica lly contain an / n / , while Set X forms add to this a /wV - / in the
s ingular , and an /-m/ in the plura l , yie lding the Awtuw forms /wa n / and / nom/ .
Personal pronouns have a somewhat different set of morphological properties
from nouns , demonstratives , and interrogatives . With regard to the suff ixes
they may accept , nouns marked for number resemble personal pronouns . In other
respects , however , personal pronouns are unique .
First of a l l , only personal pronouns may bear the Possessive suffix -ke ,
described in 6 . 3 . Second , the Obj ect suffix on personal pronouns has the
canonical form -e , subj ect to vowe l harmony ( cf . 2 . 2 . 1 0 ) , and does not exhibit
the sex gender agreement characteristic of the corresponding suffix on other
substantive lexemes . And third , personal pronouns may never bear the Locative/
Direction suffix -e/ke , described in 6 . 5 .
