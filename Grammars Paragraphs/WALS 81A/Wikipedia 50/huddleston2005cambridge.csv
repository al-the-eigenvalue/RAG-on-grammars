"O before P [ungrammatical]
b. You their arguments heard.
b. ∗Their arguments heard you.
∗Version [ia] illustrates the basic order S–P–O. In [iia] the object is preposed, but the
subject remains in the position before the predicator. The [b] examples have the object§ 3.1 Distinctive grammatical properties of the subjectbefore the predicator, and both are completely ungrammatical. S can be separated from
P by an adjunct (You never heard their arguments), but not by a complement. Noncanonical constructions where S follows P involve subject–auxiliary inversion or subject
postposing: see (e)–(f) below and §3.2.3.
(c) Case
In finite clauses a personal pronoun with distinct nominative and accusative forms
appears in the nominative when subject, and in the accusative when object: compare
I know them (with nominative I as S, accusative them as O) and They know me (nominative
they as S, accusative me as O).
In many languages case plays the major role in distinguishing subject and object,
and in such languages the order of elements is characteristically very free. In English,
however, the loss of any inflectional distinction between nominative and accusative
except in a handful of pronouns has resulted in order becoming the primary marker
of clause functions, and this limits the scope for varying the order, as illustrated above.
Note that O–P–S is excluded even where the NPs are pronouns with a nominative–
accusative contrast: ∗Them know I. This underlines the slender role of case in English
syntax: typically in a language with case-marked subject and object, such positional
reversals are permitted.
(d) Agreement
Person–number inflection in the verb is determined by agreement with the subject:
[4] i The minister knows the candidates.
ii The candidates know the minister.[knows agrees with the minister]
[know agrees with the candidates]As with case, verb agreement plays a lesser role in marking the subject in Present-day
English than in many languages, and again this is due to the large-scale loss of inflectional
contrasts: leaving aside the verb be, there is no person–number inflection in the preterite,
and in the present tense we have only a two-way contrast between 3rd person singular
and any other person–number combination (as in the above knows vs know). Thus in
You know the candidates the verb-form know provides no indication that the subject is
you. It is worth observing, however, that although more often than not the subject is not
directly identifiable by pronominal case and verbal person–number, inflection still has a
significant indirect role: the subject status of you in You know the candidates is indicated
by the fact that if we replace you by she the form required will be nominative she and
know will have to be replaced by 3rd person singular knows.
(e) Subject–auxiliary inversion
In closed interrogative main clauses and various other constructions, the subject follows
the predicator instead of preceding it, as in canonical clauses: compare canonical She can
swim and She likes it with closed interrogative Can she swim? and Does she like it? The
predicator has to be an auxiliary verb, and these constructions are accordingly said to
involve subject–auxiliary inversion.
This property provides an indirect way of identifying the subject in structures not
illustrating inversion: you can be confirmed as subject of You know the candidates because
it is you that comes to occupy the post-auxiliary position when we convert this declarative
to the corresponding closed interrogative Do you know the candidates?","[256, 257]"
"§ 5.4 Class 3may, in favourable circumstances, trigger an implicature that permission is given to the
object-referent. Permit and let behave in essentially the same way. So indeed do the
modals can and may in their deontic sense, except that here only one argument is
encoded: the raised complement is thus subject, not object. You can come in now may
be interpreted in context as “I give you permission to come in now”, but the giver and
receiver of permission are not encoded as arguments of can.
Order has a meaning comparable in specificity to give permission rather than allow : it involves issuing some (normally verbal) order. But the object clearly doesn’t
encode the recipient of the order in examples like He ordered the documents to be destroyed: this has a raised object and is equivalent to the finite construction He ordered
that the documents be destroyed. Nevertheless, order differs from allow in that the cases
where the object clearly does not represent the recipient of the order predominantly
have passive infinitivals.41 Thus whereas we can say He ordered that the data be freely
available to all interested parties, the infinitival #He ordered the data to be available to
all interested parties is anomalous (since it requires us to take the data as recipient of
the order).
With a human object and active infinitival there is a strong implicature that the object
represents the recipient, so that He ordered Kim to unlock the safe, say, is not equivalent
to He ordered that Kim unlock the safe. Command is more straightforward in that it does
not normally allow a raised object with a passive: #He commanded the documents to be
destroyed.
3 Aiii: oblique-complex (Kim appealed to them to release the hostages)
[38]appeal [to]bank [on]count [on]depend [on]keep on2 [at]rely [on]These take a catenative complement only in combination with a prepositional complement; in addition call uniquely occurs either in this construction or in the for-complex:
cf. [9iia–b] of §3 (He called for Ed to be sacked ; He called on Ed to resign).
Class 3 B: infinitival, gerund-participial, or past-participial
Verbs in this class all take non-genitives in the gerund-participial. We distinguish two
subclasses on the basis of matrix passivisation.
3 Bi: no matrix passivisation (I got them to talk /talking; I got my car repaired )
[39]get4have3 BThese belong semantically with the verbs of causation, but occur in a wider range of
constructions than the others, which are found in classes 3 Ai and 3 Aii: we consider them
all together here. The distinction between ordinary and raised complements is seen
in:
[40] i They forced/compelled Kim to unlock the safe.
[ordinary object]
ii This caused both of us to overlook the inconsistency.
[raised object]
Force and compel (3 Ai) impose selectional restrictions on the object and assign an agentive role to the covert subject of the infinitival: in [i] force/compulsion is applied directly
41Not exclusively, however: cf. France has ordered nuclear testing to resume. Occasional examples of this kind are
also found with instruct: I instructed prison routine to continue as normal.","[1254, 1255]"

"601602Chapter 7 Prepositions and preposition phrases
 Position of the preposition relative to its complementThe traditional definition specifies that prepositions usually precede the NP they govern. Simplified versions often omit the qualification ‘usually’, but it is indispensable for
two reasons. In the first place, a very small number of English prepositions can follow
the complement: compare notwithstanding the weather (head + complement) and the
weather notwithstanding (complement + head) – we deal with these items in §4.2. Secondly, we have to allow for cases like What are you looking at?, where the complement
appears in prenuclear position in the clause and the preposition is said to be stranded –
this matter is discussed in §4.1. Preposition stranding is restricted to various kinds of
non-canonical construction such as open interrogatives, relatives, etc.: in canonical constructions traditional prepositions (with the minor exception of the notwithstanding
type) always do precede their complements. But so do verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
The location of prepositions before their complements is thus not a distinguishing feature
of the category. Moreover, we have argued that not all prepositions have complements,
and where they don’t the issue of relative position obviously doesn’t arise.
It should be clear that the term ‘preposition’ is by no means ideal for our purposes, for it is
etymologically divisible into a base position and a prefix pre · meaning “before”. However, the
term is so thoroughly established that we have found it best to retain it despite the shift in
sense, and the application to a category of words not defined by linear order at all.
It is helpful that the first syllable of ‘preposition’ is pronounced /pre/, as in prep (“homework”), not /pri/, as in pre-war, where the “before” meaning is transparent. Preposition thus
falls together with such words as supposition or proposition, in which there is no longer a
prefix that makes an independent contribution to the meaning.
There are languages where words of the category in question characteristically follow the
NP complement, as in Japanese, and in grammars of such languages they are generally called
‘postpositions’. However, in most such languages transitive verbs follow their objects, so again
order is not distinctive. Rather, there is a general typological distinction between head +
complement and complement + head languages. The term ‘postposition’ is transparently
analysable into a meaningful prefix and a base, and when it is contrasted with ‘preposition’
the etymological meaning of ‘pre·’ is revived.
Because position relative to the complement reflects general typological features, one
wouldn’t want to regard Japanese postpositions as representing a different primary category
from English prepositions. For example, the phrase T ōky ō ni clearly has a structure parallel
to that of its English translation to Tokyo. The term ‘adposition’ is accordingly used by some
linguists as a more general term covering both ‘postposition’ and ‘preposition’. This term
is not used, however, to form a term for the phrases headed by adpositions. There is no
established term ‘adposition phrase’.
It has to be recognised, therefore, that the term ‘preposition’ is ambiguous. In one sense
it is neutral as to linear position, and in the other it is restricted to words which precede their
complements. In this book we are using it in the former sense, but since we are describing a
language where these words do characteristically precede their complements the dual usage
should not create any problems. All that is necessary here is that the reader should see that
in our sense of the term there is no contradiction in saying that the weather notwithstanding
is a preposition phrase headed by the preposition notwithstanding.","[621, 622]"

Italics are used for all expressions cited in orthography.
Bold italics are used to emphasise that we are citing a lexeme in abstraction from any of
its inflectional forms, as in ‘the verb go’ (p. 27).
“Double quotation marks” enclose meanings, or propositions.
Underlining (single or double) and square brackets serve to highlight part of an example.
small capitals are used, where appropriate, to indicate focal stress: I DID tell you.
Arrows mark intonation, with  representing a rising pitch,  a falling pitch, as in Is it a
boy  or a girl ?
The symbol ‘—’, as in ‘what Kim bought —’, represents a gap (p. 49).
The symbol ‘·’ marks a morphological division within a word or a component part of a
word, as in ‘work·er·s ’ or ‘the suffix ·s ’.
Subscript indices, such as ‘i ’ or ‘j ’, mark pairs of items related as antecedent and anaphor
(p. 49); thus in ‘Jilli said shei would help’, the pronoun she is to be interpreted as
anaphoric to the antecedent Jill.
The following symbols indicate the status of examples (in the interpretation under
consideration):

The slash symbol ‘/’ separates alternatives: The picture seemed excellent/distorted represents
an abbreviation of the two examples The picture seemed excellent and The picture seemed
distorted. Similarly, I asked you not to leave / ∗to don’t leave until tomorrow is an abbreviation of I asked you not to leave until tomorrow and ∗I asked you to don’t leave until
tomorrow. The slash is flanked by spaces unless both alternatives consist of a single word.
Parentheses enclose optional elements: The error was overlooked (by Pat) is an abbreviation
of The error was overlooked by Pat and The error was overlooked.
The letters ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent different speakers in an interchange, as in A: Where’s the
key? B: It’s in the top drawer.","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"3.1 Distinctive grammatical properties of the subject
(a) Category
The prototypical subject has the form of an NP. In [2], for example, identification of the
subject is completely straightforward on this basis:
[2] i The moral objections are more important.
ii An upturned seat lay across the path.
In [i] there is only one NP; in [ii] there are two, but the second, the path, is complement
within the PP across the path and hence does not function directly in the structure of
the clause. These examples were chosen as ones where the order can be reversed (More
important are the moral objections ; Across the path lay an upturned seat) without changing
the subject.
Subordinate clauses can also function as subject, as in That he was guilty was obvious
to everyone; such subjects are, however, non-prototypical, as is reflected in the existence
of a more frequent (non-canonical) alternant in which the subject function is assumed
by the dummy NP it and the subordinate clause is extraposed: It was obvious to everyone
that he was guilty. Other categories appear as subject only under very restrictive conditions. The major issue, therefore, is what distinguishes a subject NP from NPs in other
clause functions, especially object.
(b) Position
The default position of the subject is before the predicator, external to the VP constituent.
In transitive clauses, linear order is the most important factor distinguishing the subject
from the object, whose basic position is after the predicator, internal to the VP.
Compare, for example, the following, with you as S, their arguments as O:
[3]S before P
i a. You heard their arguments.
ii a. Their arguments you heard.",[256]
"In the finite construction, the subordinator that is readily omissible after so, but hardly
after in order, which is somewhat more formal and considerably less frequent. The finite
construction usually contains a modal auxiliary, such as might in [i], can in [iii]; clauses
without modals are certainly possible, however, especially in the negative, and we also
find examples of the subjunctive construction with in order:727Chapter 8 The clause: adjuncts728[8]i We think we have to fight in order that Cuba is integrated into the Latin American
system.
ii I’ll try and get home a little earlier than usual so we don’t have to rush.
iii The administration had to show resolve in order that he not be considered a
lame-duck president.(b) Ungoverned clauses: infinitivals or finites with may/might
[9] i We left early to miss the rush-hour.
ii He requested an adjournment that he might have adequate time to study the
documents.
Here the subordinate clause functions as purpose adjunct itself, rather than being governed by a preposition. Example [i] illustrates the most frequent type of purpose adjunct,
while [ii] by contrast is very rare and formal: instead of the content clause that we have
here, we would usually have a PP headed by in order or so.21 Ungoverned infinitivals are
always positive: a negative requires a governing preposition. In He modified the story
somewhat in order not to offend his parents, for example, we cannot omit in order.
(c) PPs with NP complements
[10] i I did it for fun /for your sake /for her benefit.
ii He called in Kim [with a view to /with the intention of obtaining some professional
advice].
Example [i] illustrates the purposive use of for, while the construction in [ii] depends
for its purposive meaning on the lexical content of the head noun, and the noun purpose
itself could of course substitute for intention.
 Syntactic functionPurpose elements are usually adjuncts, but they are also found as predicative complements: This is in order that the local delegates can be officially informed.
 Further remarks on infinitival clauses(a) Infinitivals with an overt subject
Infinitivals governed by so + as cannot contain a subject: if a subject has to be expressed
after so, the finite construction is required. Both infinitivals that are governed by in order
and those that are ungoverned may have a subject preceded by the subordinator for,
though this construction is much less common than the subjectless one:
[11](In order) for the flavours to mingle properly, the dish should be cooked very slowly
in a low oven.(b) Governed infinitivals with no subject
In subjectless clauses governed by in order or so as, the antecedent for the missing subject
is the subject of the matrix clause:
[12]
21He resigned in order /so as to avoid any conflict of interest.","[747, 748]"
"3.1.1 Basic reflexives in verb domains
Where antecedent and pronoun are related to the same verb, a reflexive form is almost
always admissible; when they are both related to it directly, rather than via a preposition,
the reflexive is (with one minor exception) mandatory.
In clauses with canonical constituent order, a reflexive must follow its antecedent. For
this reason, the antecedent is usually the subject of the clause – and the subject cannot
itself be reflexive:
[12] i Sue defended herself.
[subject as antecedent]
∗
ii Herself defended Sue.
[subject as reflexive anaphor]
We will review in turn the various functions where verb domain reflexives occur in
the simplest constructions, and then turn briefly to clauses with non-canonical order.
(a) Reflexive pronoun in direct object function
Here the antecedent is subject and the reflexive mandatory:18
[13] i The protesters chained themselves to the Embassy railings.
ii Tim considered himself a victim of the system.
iii Liz believes herself to be suitable for the job.
iv Everyone committed themselves to continuing the fight.
v Sue was the only one [who defended herself ].
These examples illustrate reflexive objects in a range of transitive constructions.
Example [i] represents the elementary case where antecedent and pronoun represent
arguments of the same verb. In [ii] we have a complex-transitive clause with the object
himself predicand for the following predicative complement. In [iii] herself is a raised
object (Ch. 14, §3.1.1). These first three examples have the pronoun coreferential with
the antecedent, while [iv] illustrates again the case where a pronoun expresses a bound
variable, as discussed for non-reflexive forms in §2.3.2. In [v] anaphor and antecedent
are located within a subordinate (relative) clause.19
Verbs that select mandatory reflexives
A number of verbs select objects that are required to be anaphorically linked with the
subject, and these must then be reflexive in form:
[14] i a. He cried himself to sleep that night.
ii a. Ann acquitted herself extremely well.b. Ed prides himself on his tolerance.
b. You express yourself very clearly.",[1507]
"§ 4.2.2 The catenative-auxiliary analysisanalysis allows the construction to be handled with a simpler model of constituency. The ease
with which we can insert elements between auxiliary and ‘main verb’ casts serious doubt on
the idea that they form a syntactic constituent comparable with, say, NP, AdjP, PP, and the like.
 Ordering constraintsUnder the dependent-auxiliary analysis the fixed ordering of the auxiliaries is catered for by
stipulating that the VGp has the structure shown in [20]. Under the catenative analysis the
order results from certain independently needed constraints.31
(a) Initial position of the modals
This is attributable to their defective morphology: they have no secondary forms and so can’t
appear in the non-finite complement of another verb.32
(b) Final position of passive be
This is due to the fact that it is the following verb that is passivised: the preceding auxiliaries –
the modals, have, and progressive be – don’t have objects and are outside the scope of the
voice contrast. Compare now:
[36] i The king appears to be hated by his subjects.
ii The king may be hated by his subjects.
Be occupies second position among the verbs in [ii] for the same reason as in [i]: may, like
appear, is outside the scope of the passive.
(c) Fixed order of perfect and progressive
Be can’t precede have because of a more general constraint excluding perfect have from the
complements of aspectual verbs:
[37] i ∗He was having read the book.
ii ∗He began having read the book.
iii ∗He stopped having read the book.
 ConclusionThe dependent-auxiliary analysis has certain attractions for textual analysis, in that it very
much reduces the amount of embedding that has to be recognised. It may have been raining,
for example, will be a simple clause instead of a complex one with three layers of embedding.
Given the high frequency of auxiliary verbs, this will result in a very considerable ‘saving’
in the analysis of most texts. It is also simpler in that we don’t have to decide which clause
temporal and similar dependents should be assigned to – e.g. whether at noon belongs with
be or with sleep in They were still sleeping at noon. And the cases where we have shown
it to give clearly unacceptable results are textually quite rare. Nevertheless, we believe we
have shown that from a more theoretical perspective the catenative analysis is very much
sounder.
It follows that in [10] above we distinguish just three categories, sequence of main clauses,
finite subordination, and non-finite subordination. Within this last category, catenative
31In languages where mood, tense, and aspect are marked inflectionally there is some tendency for an aspect
marker to be closer to the lexical base than a tense marker, and for the latter to be closer than a mood marker;
the English syntactic order matches that morphological order.
32
The have of We have to stop and the like is not a member of the syntactic category of modal auxiliaries, and in
particular is not defective. It is therefore not catered for by structure [20] – e.g. it can precede or follow the
perfect (You have to have completed three years of undergraduate study; I have had to put it aside). Nevertheless,
in some varieties it can be used as a core auxiliary (Ch. 3, §2.5.6), and there is no evident reason why it should
then be treated differently from other core auxiliaries.","[1238, 1239]"
"243244Chapter 4 The clause: complements
 Distinguishing the two non-basic positionsIn clauses containing an auxiliary verb but no lexical verb, the two non-basic positions
look superficially the same:
[14] i Where were the children’s toys?
ii Under the bed were the children’s toys.[post-auxiliary]
[postposed]They can be easily distinguished, however, by adding a non-auxiliary verb: Where were
the children’s toys hidden? reveals that [i] has the subject in post-auxiliary position, and
Under the bed were hidden the children’s toys shows that [ii] has a subject in postposed
position.
 Subject postposing affects order, not functionWe have assumed that the financial arguments is subject in all three of the examples in
[13], and hence that they differ only in the order of elements, not in the assignment of
functions to equally flawed and the financial arguments. This is very obvious in the case of
[ii], but is worth demonstrating for [iii], since this construction is sometimes found as an
alternant of the existential: compare Over her desk was a photograph of her grandparents
and Over her desk there was a photograph of her grandparents. Evidence that the financial
arguments is subject of [13iii] is provided by agreement (cf. Equally flawed is the financial
objection), the interrogative tag (Equally flawed had been the financial arguments, hadn’t
they?) and, very marginally, case (?Equally flawed are they).
 The order X–P–SIn spite of the importance of position in marking the subject, it interacts with other
factors. The order X–P–S is excluded where X is O, but not for other values of X.
A non-object X can even occasionally take the form of an NP:
[15] i A thorough rogue was James Bacharach.
ii The following morning came news of her father’s arrest.
iii ∗A loud explosion heard the children.","[263, 264]"
"14891490Chapter 17 Deixis and anaphora
 Non-canonical constituent orderThe basic rule, we have noted, is that a reflexive pronoun must follow its antecedent. It
can precede the antecedent, however, in cases of preposing:
[23] i To herself, the coordinator allocated the first watch.
ii Himself, he excused from these onerous duties.
These correspond to the canonical structures:
[24] i The coordinator allocated the first watch to herself.
ii He excused himself from these onerous duties.
In [24] the order is determined by the basic rule, and in [23] the choice as to which
of the linked NPs is treated as anaphor and which as antecedent is the same as in the
corresponding canonical structure. Again, then, we cannot have a reflexive as subject of
a main clause: ∗To the coordinatori , herselfi had allocated the first watch.
Where the antecedent is object rather than subject (as in [20i], I had to save Mary
from herself ) such a reversal of the order of a reflexive and its antecedent is in principle
possible in clauses with heavy-object postposing, but in practice examples of this kind
are of questionable acceptability:
[25]?","[1509, 1510]"
"As the above formulation makes clear, it is only the [a] examples that we analyse as
ditransitive, as double-object constructions. In [b] the PP to/for Sue is not an indirect
object, not an object at all, having none of the properties outlined in §4.1 above, and the
NP Sue is of course an oblique, hence not a possible object of the verb.
This departs from the traditional analysis where the PPs to Sue and for Sue (or just the NP
within them) are taken to be indirect objects. The traditional account appears to be based
solely on the fact that the semantic role (recipient or beneficiary) of Sue is the same in [b] as
in [a]. But Sue also has that role in the passives Sue was sent a copy and % Sue was ordered a
copy, yet no one would want to say it was indirect object here: it is clearly subject. We have
seen that the grammar allows for varying alignments of semantic role and syntactic function:
syntactic functions must be assigned on the basis of syntactic properties, not semantic ones.
 Oi and Od distinguished by orderWhen both objects follow P (as in all canonical clauses) their relative order is fixed, with
Oi preceding Od .23 If we switch the order of the two NPs we change their functions,
yielding a clause with a quite different meaning or else an anomaly:
[8]i a. They offered all the overseas students one of the experienced tutors. [Oi –Od ]
b. They offered one of the experienced tutors all the overseas students. [Oi –Od ]
ii a. He gave Sue the key.
[Oi –Od ]
b. #He gave the key Sue.
[anomalous]The effect of the switch is comparable to that of switching S and O NPs in a monotransitive: Ed saw Kim vs Kim saw Ed or Kim enjoyed the concert vs #The concert enjoyed Kim.
In the ditransitive case, however, the switch almost always results in anomaly, because in
the great majority of such clauses Oi is human (or at least animate) and Od inanimate,
as in [iia].
In constructions where an object occupies prenuclear position, Od –S–P–Oi (with the
first post-verbal element being Oi , as in the canonical construction) is strongly preferred
to Oi –S–P–Od :
[9]23Od –S–P–Oi
i a. The key he gave Sue.
ii a. The key which he lent me didn’t fit
the lock.
iii a. He asked what I bought her.
iv a. What a lot of hardship he caused
them!",[268]
"§ 4.3 Ditransitive clausesSpeakers vary considerably in their judgements of the [b] examples, particularly of those
where the corresponding prepositional construction has to, as in [ib/iib], rather than for,
as in [iiib/ivb]. Nevertheless, there is very widespread agreement that the [b] examples
are significantly less acceptable than the [a] ones.
 Ditransitives and their related passivesTwo passive constructions need to be distinguished according to which object the passive
subject corresponds to:
[10] i a. I sent Sue a copy.
ii a. Sue was sent a copy.
iii a. ?A copy was sent Sue.b. I ordered Sue a copy.
b. ?Sue was ordered a copy.
b. ∗A copy was ordered Sue.[first passive]
[second passive]We use the term first passive for the one where the subject corresponds to the first object,
Oi , and second passive for [iii], where it corresponds to the second object, Od . These
terms also reflect the order of preference: the first passive tends to be quite strongly
favoured over the second. Ditransitive verbs vary considerably in how readily they occur
in passive clauses. In general, where Oi corresponds to the complement of to in the
prepositional alternant [7i], characteristically having the semantic role of recipient, the
first passive is fully acceptable, as in [10iia]; judgements vary as to the acceptability of
second passives like [10iiia]: many find them unacceptable,24 and they are textually quite
rare. Where Oi corresponds to the complement of for in [7ii], with the semantic role
of beneficiary, neither passive is completely acceptable, but many speakers find the first
marginally possible.
 Ditransitive Oi and Od compared with monotransitive OdWe have been assuming that the second object of a canonical ditransitive can be identified
with the single object of a monotransitive (as Od ) while the first is a distinct type of object (Oi ).
This is not entirely unproblematic, however, as is evident from the following examination
of the properties of Oi and what for convenience we will refer to as ‘monotransitive Od ’ and
‘ditransitive Od ’.
(a) Passives
We have noted that the first passive (with the subject corresponding to Oi ) is preferred over
the second (where the subject corresponds to ditransitive Od ). This makes Oi somewhat more
like monotransitive Od than is ditransitive Od . However, the marginality of [10iib] shows that
it by no means behaves like a prototypical monotransitive Od .
(b) Post-verbal position
It is of course Oi rather than ditransitive Od that characteristically occupies the position
immediately following P, as in [10i]. It is, however, significantly more resistant to departures
from this position than is monotransitive Od , as we see from the next two points.25
24
Acceptability is greater when we have a personal pronoun + by phrase: This copy was given me by my grandfather.
25
iNote also that O does not readily allow a particle to intervene between it and P: examples like I gave John
back his sunglasses are more acceptable than ? I gave back John his sunglasses, an order that many speakers
find unacceptable. The issue is complicated by the fact that the presence of a particle will often favour a PP
complement over an Oi . Thus while He sent his students out a questionnaire may be more acceptable than ? He
sent out his students a questionnaire, it is appreciably less so than He sent out a questionnaire to his students or
He sent a questionnaire out to his students.","[268, 269]"

strengthThe great majority of the head nouns are morphologically derived from (or homonymous
with) verbs of matching senses that take the same complementation, as with those in
[i]. Those in [ii] are similarly derived from adjectives, while with those in [iii] the
complementation is not predictable in this way. Compare then:
[11] i a Kim decided to go to Bonn.
ii a. Pat was eager to help us.
iii a. [no relevant counterpart]b. Kim’s decision to go to Bonn
b. Pat’s eagerness to help us
b. the opportunity to make a quick profitWe include strength in [iii], not [ii], because the adjective strong does not take an infinitival complement. Note, then, that the following do not have matching structures or12591260Chapter 14 Non-finite and verbless clausesinterpretations:
[12] i She was strong to withstand this pressure.
ii She had the strength to withstand this pressure.
In [i] the infinitival is an adjunct in the clause; the meaning is that she withstood the
pressure, this indicating that she was strong. In [ii] the infinitival is a complement, and
the meaning is “She had the strength necessary to withstand the pressure”.
All the nouns in [10] take subjectless infinitivals, and those with the annotation ‘F’
also allow the construction with subordinator for + subject:
[13] i This provided an opportunity [for them to plan the next step].
ii Permission [for the ceremony to be held in the church itself ]was finally granted.
A number of other nouns in our list could probably also occur with for + subject in the
infinitival, but it is in general a relatively infrequent construction, and judgements as to
whether a given noun could appear here are not always clear-cut.
In the subjectless construction, the antecedent for the missing subject may be found
within the NP (as genitive determiner or within a PP complement), as in [14i], or
outside the NP, as in [ii], and in cases like [iii] there is no antecedent in the sentence
at all:
[14] i a. your /Kim’s promise to help me with my tax return
b. a proposal by the government to introduce a goods-and-services tax
c. the willingness of the other members to agree to the proposal
d. an instruction to the secretary to call an extraordinary meeting
ii a. They gave me instructions [to evacuate the building].
b. I received instructions [to evacuate the building].
c. What I hadn’t expected to receive was an instruction [to evacuate the building].
iii They were discussing a proposal [to introduce a summer semester].
In general, the recovery of the understood subject is determined by semantic principles, not rules of syntax. But in some cases the matter is more grammaticalised; with
selection, for example, the antecedent is normally required to appear as complement
to of :
[15] i The selection of Judge Carter to head the inquiry is to be welcomed.
ii ∗The selection to head the inquiry hasn’t yet been announced.
iii ∗Judge Carter is their selection to head the inquiry.
 Nouns do not take raised complementsIn general, clauses with raised complements, licensed by raising verbs or adjectives, do
not have counterparts with the form of NPs:
[16] i a. Kim seemed to be distressed.
ii a. I believe them to be genuine.
iii a. They are certain to resent it.b. ∗the seeming of Kim to be distressed
b. ∗my belief in/of them to be genuine
b. ∗their certainty to resent itOne exception involves the verb tend, which has the noun counterpart tendency. Corresponding to clausal The tabloids tend to support Labour and the equivalent Labour tends to be
supported by the tabloids we have:§ 8.2 Non-finite complements of nouns[17] i a. the tendency for the tabloids to support Labour
b. the tendency for Labour to be supported by the tabloids
ii a. the tendency of the tabloids to support Labour
b. Labour’s tendency /the tendency of Labour to be supported by the tabloids
In [ia/ib] the tabloids and Labour are subjects of the infinitival clauses, and the equivalence
between the whole NPs simply reflects the equivalence holding between the active and passive
subordinate clauses they contain. In [ii], however, the tabloids and Labour are oblique or
genitive complements of tendency: here, therefore, they appear to bear some resemblance
to raised complements. There is, however, a major difference between the NP and clause
constructions. Dummy elements can occur as raised complements in clause structure, but they
cannot occur as oblique or genitive complement of tendency – or of any other noun. There
does not have a genitive form and cannot normally occur as complement of a preposition,
but these general restrictions do not apply to it, and yet this too cannot be used in the relevant
positions when it is a dummy element:
[18] i a. It tends to be the wife who provides this support.
b. ∗its tendency to be the wife who provides this support
ii a. It tends to be more efficient to pay by credit card than by cheque.
b. ∗its tendency to be more efficient to pay by credit card than by cheque
Such data argue that nouns, unlike verbs and adjectives, do not take raised complements.
We take the tabloids and Labour, therefore, to represent arguments of tendency in [17iia–b]
respectively, though not of course in [17i]. The relation between [17ia] and [17iia] is thus the
same as that between [8ib] and [8ia] of §6.3 (It was hard for Ed to accept her criticism and Her
criticism was hard for Ed to accept).
The same applies to failure, derived from the raising verb fail. The verb allows dummy
subjects, but the noun does not:
[19] i It had failed to become apparent, even after a day, what their intentions were.
ii ∗its failure to become apparent, even after a day, what their intentions were
Consider finally the case of order:
[20] i a. They ordered the building to be evacuated.
b. #the order to the building to be evacuated
c. the order for the building to be evacuated
ii a. They ordered the doctor to examine the victims.
b. the order to the doctor to examine the victims
c. the order for the doctor to examine the victims
The verb takes a raised object: the building is not an argument of the verb in [ia]. But with
the noun the complement of to is an argument, with the role of recipient of the order.
Hence the anomaly of [ib]: one doesn’t give orders to buildings. The nominal structure
thus differs from the verbal one in allowing for this role to be explicitly encoded. It does
not have to be, however, for we can also have [ic/iic]: these match the verbal (clausal) construction in not encoding who received the order. Here the building and the doctor function
as subject of the infinitival, not as oblique complement of the noun. Again, then, oblique
complements of the noun are not raised: they have to be interpretable as arguments of the
noun.","[1279, 1280, 1281]"
"10131014Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speechnot with provided : the coordination here is between two expanded declaratives, two clauses
introduced by that.
A second point is that the that is usually omissible: we can equally have I’ll do it provided
you pay me. Under analysis [7b] this is covered by the general rules for the omission of the
subordinator that as described in §3.1; under analysis [7a] it has to be treated as a separate
phenomenon.
Thirdly, in order allows an infinitival complement, with or without a subject:
[8]i [in order] [that their baby have food]
ii [in order] [for their baby to have food]
iii [in order] [to save food for their baby]Traditional grammars commonly recognise two complex units here, in order that and in order
to. But this doesn’t cater for [ii]. The relation between [ii] and [iii] is just like that between
It is essential [for their baby to have food] and It is essential [to save food for their baby]. If
an infinitival clause contains a subject it takes for as subordinator, and for is permitted only
when there is a subject. It is clear, then, that the structural division in [ii–iii] is between in
order and the infinitival clause, as shown by the bracketing. And similarly in [i] the structural
division comes before that, not after it; that as a marker of a finite declarative contrasts with
for as the marker of an infinitival one with subject–predicate form. Similarly, items such as
notwithstanding, except, granted take either a content clause or an NP as complement:
[9]i notwithstanding [that the commission has not yet made its report]
ii notwithstanding [the delay in the publication of the commission’s report]We don’t want to say there are two items notwithstanding that and notwithstanding : there is
just one item, the preposition notwithstanding, and that appears when the complement is a
declarative clause but not, of course, when it is an NP.
Once it is established that the that belongs in the content clause, it is quite clear that
provided, in order, notwithstanding, and the like are syntactically quite different from that. They
are not markers of clause subordination contrasting with that, but prepositions functioning
as heads of phrases that may contain declarative content clauses as complement.","[1033, 1034]"
"We interpret [ia] with the falling ill preceding the return to her mother’s and [ib] with
the opposite order of events, and in [ii] only [a] is acceptable since far and away is a fixed
expression.
In this section we will consider certain general factors which cause the different orders
to be less than fully interchangeable; certain more specific ones (such as that involved in
[35i]) will be taken up in the discussion of the individual coordinators in §2.
 AnaphoraOften, reversal is blocked for the simple reason that the second coordinate contains
(or has as a supplement) an item explicitly or implicitly anaphoric to the first or to an
element within it:
[36] i Her father had once lied to her and because of this she never really trusted him.
ii Jill was rich and Pat, moreover, was even richer.
In [i] this has the first coordinate as antecedent and him has her father: since an anaphoric
item and its antecedent cannot in general be located in successive coordinates, the order
can only be as in [i] itself. The same applies with [ii], where there is implicit anaphora:
the supplement moreover means roughly “besides this”, and richer is here understood as
“richer than her”. Quite similar are cases like I’ll tell the truth and nothing but the truth or
You and you alone will be held responsible, where there is repetition rather than anaphoric
reduction. The second coordinate must follow because it presupposes the first: I’ll tell
nothing but the truth presupposes that I’ll tell the truth, and so on.
 Lexicalised coordinationsA large number of coordinations – mainly pairs of words joined by and or or – are
partially or fully lexicalised. The fully lexicalised ones constitute composite lexical items
with the order completely fixed and with meanings generally not fully predictable from
those of the coordinates and the coordinator:
[37] aid and abet
betwixt and between by and large
common or garden
first and foremost hem and haw
high and dry
hither and yon
let or hindrance
part and parcel
rhyme or reason rough and ready
rough and tumble spick and span
to and fro
well and truly12871288Chapter 15 Coordination and supplementationSome of these contain words that no longer occur in contemporary English other than
in the coordination: fro, hem, spick, etc.
Partially lexicalised coordinations are combinations where the items regularly go
together in a particular order; reversal is not impossible but represents a quite sharp
departure from the expected order:
[38]buy and sell
fish and chips
hope and pray
meek and mildcome and go
for and against
husband and wife
tried and testedcup and saucer
friend and foe
life and deathcuts and bruises
head and shoulders 6
loud and clearIn both [37] and [38] the coordinates are often either near-synonyms (tried /tested,
meek/mild , first /foremost) or opposites of one kind or another (come /go, husband /
wife , buy/sell ).7
 Ordering tendenciesIn many cases, the fixed or preferred order of coordinates in fully or partially lexicalised
coordinations reflects certain tendencies that favour one order over another in ordinary,
non-lexicalised coordinations too.8
(a) Temporal order
Coordinates denoting periods or points of time tend to be ordered so as to match the
temporal order: past, present, and future ; yesterday, today, and tomorrow; the morning,
afternoon, and evening; sooner or later; on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.Similarly with
states ordered in time, as in life and death, or parts of a whole, as beginning and end.
(b) Spatial hierarchy
With items arranged on the vertical dimension, there is a tendency to put the higher
before the lower: up and down , upstairs and downstairs , upper and lower, above and
below , head and shoulders, top and bottom. It may be that this order reflects the greater
salience of the higher in important cases like above and below ground, above and below the
horizon, and arguably a similar salience hierarchy is reflected on the horizontal dimension
in the ordering of front and back, fore and aft, etc.
(c) Deixis
The order in here and there, hither and thither, now and then, this and that reflects a deictic
hierarchy, with the reference of the first coordinate being closer to the deictic centre, the
time and place of the speech act. With the category of person, however, the hierarchy is
overridden by a convention of politeness, which has 1st person in final position. Compare
you and your sister (which accords with the hierarchy: 2nd person before 3rd) and my
sister and I (reversing the hierarchy, with 3rd person before 1st).9
6
This is fully lexicalised in its metaphorical sense: This model is head and shoulders above the rest.
7Comparable to lexicalisation is institutionalisation in the form of proper names – of books, public houses,
organisations, etc. Many such names consist of or include coordinations, and the order of the coordinates is
of course fixed as part of the name: Pride and Prejudice ; the Hare and Hounds ; the Department of Employment,
Education and Training.
8
Lexicalisation may also have been facilitated in expressions following certain phonologically favoured patterns, such as shorter before longer (in terms of number of syllables, stuff and nonsense, out and about,
or length of vowel, stress and strain, brush and comb), high vowels before low in monosyllables (dribs
and drabs, fits and starts), more sonorant before less sonorant initial consonant (high and dry, hope and
pray).
9
Non-standard !Me and my sister were alone simply follows the deictic hierarchy. With time and space factors
(a) and (b) may outweigh (c): yesterday, today, and tomorrow ; up there and down here.","[1307, 1308]"
"451452Chapter 5 Nouns and noun phrases15 Order of elements in NP structure
The preceding sections have introduced the main kinds of dependents that we distinguish
in describing NP structure, and we must now say something further about the order
in which they occur. The ordering constraints are of two kinds, which we call rigid
and labile ordering constraints. Violation of a rigid ordering contraint results in clear
ungrammaticality, as when the determiner is placed after the head instead of before it –
compare the unicorn and ∗unicorn the. A labile ordering constraint, on the other hand,
gives the preferred order in the default case: departures from this order will often be of
questionable acceptability but they may also be justified by considerations of scope and
information packaging. Compare:
[1]i I want to buy [a large black sofa] / ?[a black large sofa].
ii I want to buy a [black large sofa], not those other colours of large sofa you insist on
showing me.","[471, 472]"
"2930Chapter 1 Preliminariesif I say this I am not telling you, or asking you, to sleep well, but expressing the hope
or wish that you will. Yet grammatically it belongs with [ia] and [iia]: it is clearly an
imperative clause. Conversely, [iib] conveys the same kind of meaning as [iia], but has a
quite different grammatical structure: it is not imperative but interrogative. Again, then,
satisfying the terms of the definition is not necessary for a clause to be imperative (as
[ib] shows), nor is it sufficient (as [iib] shows). The relation between form and meaning
here is too complex for one to be able to determine whether a clause is imperative or not
simply on the basis of its meaning.
The traditional definition of noun is unsatisfactory for a somewhat different reason.
The problem here is that the concept of ‘thing’ (or perhaps ‘name’) is too vague to
provide a workable criterion. There are countless abstract nouns such as absence, fact,
flaw, idea, indeterminacy, lack, necessity, etc., so ‘thing’ cannot be intended as equivalent
to ‘physical object’; but we have no way of telling whether a word denotes (or is the name
of) a thing unless we already know on independent, grammatical, grounds whether it is
a noun. Take, for example:
[19] i I was annoyed at their rejection of my proposals.
ii I was annoyed that they rejected my proposals.[noun]
[verb]These have essentially the same meaning, but rejection is a noun and rejected a verb.
What enables us to tell that rejection but not rejected belongs to the category of noun is
not that rejection denotes a thing while rejected does not, but that they figure in quite
different grammatical constructions. Thus rejection contrasts with rejections as singular
vs plural, whereas rejected contrasts with reject as preterite vs present tense. The transitive
verb rejected takes a direct object (my proposals), but nouns do not take direct objects, so
we need a prepositional complement in [i] (of my proposals). Similarly, rejected takes a
nominative subject (they), whereas rejection takes a genitive like their or a determinative
like the. And if we wanted to add some modification we would need an adjective in [i]
(e.g. their immediate rejection of my proposals), but an adverb in [ii] (that they immediately
rejected my proposals).
The problem with notional definitions is that they do not refer to the kinds of property
that motivate the use in the grammar of the theoretical concepts being defined. The
reason we need such concepts as noun, preterite, imperative clause in writing a grammar
of English is that they enable us to make general statements about words, about the
inflection of verbs, about the structure of clauses. Lexemes fall into a number of major
categories on the basis of their inflection, the kinds of dependent they take and the
function in larger constructions of the phrases they head: noun belongs in this system
of lexeme categories. Verbs have a variety of inflectional forms, and the preterite is one
of these. Clauses show structural contrasts on one dimension according to the presence
or absence of a subject, its position relative to the verb, and the inflectional form of the
verb, so that we have contrasts between such sets as (a) You are punctual, (b) Are you
punctual?, (c) Be punctual: ‘imperative clause’ is one of the terms in this system of clausal
constructions.
A satisfactory definition or explanation of concepts like noun, preterite, and imperative clause must therefore identify the grammatical properties that distinguish them
from the concepts with which they contrast. The discussion of rejection and rejected in
[19] illustrated some of the major ways in which nouns differ from verbs. As for the§ 4.4 Defining grammatical conceptspreterite, it is distinguished in part by its form (in regular verbs it is marked by the
suffix ·ed, though this also marks the past participle), in part by its distribution (like
the present tense, but unlike other forms, a preterite form can occur as the verb of a
declarative main clause: Kim gave it away, but not, for example, ∗Kim given it away), in
part by its lack of agreement with the subject (with the single exception of the verb be),
and so on. Imperative clauses differ from declaratives and interrogatives in the form of
the verb be (Be punctual vs You are punctual ), the optionality of a 2nd person subject
(you is omissible in You be punctual, but not in You are punctual ), the formation of the
negative (compare Don’t be punctual, formed with auxiliary do, and You aren’t punctual,
with no do), and so on.
In this grammar we will be at pains, therefore, to specify the distinctive grammatical
properties of the concepts we introduce. This is not to suggest that we are not interested in
the meaning, but rather to say that we need to distinguish between grammatical concepts
and semantic ones; indeed, making such a distinction is a prerequisite for describing the
relation between them.
 General and language-particular definitionsIn criticising the traditional notional definitions, we assumed that they were intended to
enable us to determine what expressions in English belong to the categories concerned.
It must be emphasised, however, that most of the terms that figure in a grammatical
description of English are not unique to English but appear in the grammars of other
languages too – in some cases, in the grammars of all languages. There are therefore two
issues to be considered in defining or explaining such terms. At one level there is the
issue of what grammatical properties distinguish one category from another in English.
We call this the language-particular level. This is the level we have been concerned with
so far. A language-particular definition will enable us to decide which expressions in
the language concerned belong to the category. At another level there is the issue of
what principled basis we have for using the same grammatical terms in the grammars
of different languages, given that the language-particular distinctive properties will vary
from language to language. We call this the general level. The fact, for example, that the
negative imperative Don’t be punctual requires auxiliary do while the negative declarative
You aren’t punctual does not is clearly a specific fact about English: it belongs in the
language-particular definition of imperative clause for English, but not in a general
definition.
It might then be suggested that the traditional notional definitions should be construed as applying at the general rather than the language-particular level. Certainly
they are not intended to apply uniquely to English. But at the same time there can be
no doubt that as they are presented in school textbooks, for example, they purport to
be language-particular definitions: the student is meant to be able to apply them to
decide whether a given word in English is a noun, whether a verb is in the preterite,
whether a clause is imperative. In effect, the traditional definitions aim to work at both
levels simultaneously, and our objection is that the levels need to be distinguished,
and approached differently. At the language-particular level, as we have argued, it is
necessary to focus on form: to specify the grammatical features that distinguish expressions which belong to the category from those that do not. At the general level
it is quite legitimate to invoke meaning: languages serve to express meaning, and it3132Chapter 1 Preliminariesis rare to find grammatical distinctions that have no correlation at all with semantic
distinctions.
We need to make it clear when giving a general definition that it is to apply at
the general level, not the language-particular. And we need to acknowledge that the
correlation between grammatical form and meaning is typically complex rather than
one-to-one. The general definitions we propose for the categories discussed above are
as follows:
[20] i noun:
a grammatically distinct category of lexemes of which the morphologically most elementary members characteristically denote
types of physical objects (such as human beings, other biological
organisms, and natural or artificial inanimate objects)
ii preterite:
a grammatically distinct inflectional form of the verb whose primary use is to locate the situation in past time (relative to the
time of utterance)
iii imperative: a grammatically distinct clause construction whose members are
characteristically used to issue directives
The move to an avowedly general definition, together with the reference to characteristic
use of the most elementary members, enables us to avoid the vagueness of the term
‘thing’ (or ‘name’) in [16i]. The fact that such lexemes as rejection, arrival, idea do not
denote physical objects is not a problem for a definition at this level. By virtue of the
distinctive grammatical properties specified in the language-particular definition, these
lexemes belong to the same category as girl, boy, daffodil, window, etc., and this category
as a whole satisfies the general definition of noun because it contains lexemes like these
last examples that do denote physical objects. Note that the abstract nouns rejection
and arrival are morphologically derived from lexemes of another category (verb); morphologically elementary nouns, such as girl, boy, etc., characteristically denote kinds of
physical object.
Definition [20ii] allows for the fact that verb inflections often have more than one
use. In [17ia] (The finals started yesterday), we have the past time use. In [17ib] (You
said the finals started tomorrow) the preterite form started is within a subordinate clause
functioning as complement to said: this is a case of what is traditionally called indirect
reported speech. Your actual words will have been, say, The finals start tomorrow, but
present tense start is shifted into the preterite started in my report. Another use of the
preterite is seen in I wish the finals started tomorrow, where it indicates counterfactuality:
we understand that the finals do not start tomorrow. Of these three uses, it is the one
that indicates past time that is primary. The others are found only in special contexts,
such as the complement of a preterite verb of reporting or the complement of wish. This
verb-form therefore qualifies for the label preterite.
Definition [20iii] likewise overcomes the problems we noted in [16iii]. The languageparticular criteria assign Sleep well to the same category as Go to bed and Please open
the door, and since most clauses with this form are normally used as directives we call
the category imperative clause. Would you mind closing the door is excluded from the
category at the language-particular level: it does not have the distinctive grammatical
form of imperative clauses in English.","[49, 50, 51, 52]"
"13831384Chapter 16 Information packagingA gun is not heavy (and in relative terms the locative PP on the desk is slightly heavier than the object), but in terms of information status a gun is discourse-new while
a desk is discourse-old (by virtue of the prior mention of the office and the salient
relation between desks and offices). It is this difference in information status that
motivates the postposing. Postposing of this kind is less frequent than that motivated by weight. Whereas the default order version he saw a gun on the desk is quite
neutral, the version with a postposed object emphasises the unexpectedness of
the gun.
 Subject postposingPostposing of the subject is usually accompanied by preposing of another complement or
an adjunct, giving the subject–dependent inversion construction seen in More important
are the moral objections, etc.: this we deal with in §5 below. For the rest, postposing of the
subject is found in two constructions. One is the comparative construction illustrated
in [1i]; here the postposing is motivated by weight, as we have seen. The other is with
verbs of reporting:
[6]i The best solution, suggested Pat, would be to install a security alarm system.
ii Said Manager Kim Kessels: ‘This is our best result in 20 years!’Here subject postposing occurs predominantly in parentheticals, as in [i], but in journalistic style it is also found with the verb in initial position, as in [ii]. This is a different
kind of postposing from the others considered in this section, since it is apparently not
motivated by weight.
 Object postposingIn the examples given so far, the object is postposed over a PP. Other possibilities are
illustrated in [7]:
[7]i I have read very carefully /several times all the articles she has written.
ii I found rather more promising the proposals that his sister had made.","[1403, 1404]"
"Examples of idioms virtually requiring the order verb – object – preposition are:49
[43]answer back
draw out [person]
have on [“tease”]
order aboutask round/over
get up [out of bed]
have out
take abackboss about/around
have down [as guest]
leave alone
work over [“beat up”]6.3.2 Constructions containing verb + intransitive preposition idioms
Verbal idioms of this kind are found in the following structures (again leaving aside those
containing subordinate clauses as complement):
[44] i verb – prep
ii verb – prep – O
iii verb – Oi – prep – Od
iv verb – prep – transitive PP
v verb – O – prep – transitive PP
vi verb – prep – (as) PC
vii verb – O – prep – [as + PC]He gave in.

"§ 18.2 Semantically motivated overridesExamples [i–iv] – from a letter to shareholders from the chairperson of a major British
company, a newspaper, government instructions relating to academic grant applications,
a formal notice in a credit union office – are unquestionably ungrammatical, but examples of this kind are not uncommon, even in written texts. They clearly involve processing
errors: the subjects are relatively complex, and the verb has been made to agree with a
plural NP within the subject rather than with the singular subject NP itself. The position
of the plural NP immediately before the verb has presumably given it greater salience for
the writer at the time of choosing the verb than the singular NP containing it. In the case
of [i] and [iv], and perhaps [ii] also, the selection of the plural NP as agreement source is
facilitated by the fact that it could substitute for the larger subject NP with little change
to the meaning: The Directors believe that the above resolutions are in the best interests of
the Company, and so on.
This phenomenon is often described in terms of the concept of ‘proximity’: the verb
agrees with the proximate preceding NP. The proximate preceding NP is the one whose
head is closest to the verb: in [7i] the NPs the effect of the above resolutions and the above
resolutions both immediately precede the verb, but the second is the proximate one since
its head resolutions is closer to the verb than effect, the head of the first. English clearly has
no general rule saying that the verb agrees with the proximate preceding NP (which is
why we have starred these examples), but we will see that there are places where proximity
is a relevant factor in more acceptable departures from simple agreement – and indeed
one such case is seen in [vi].
Example [7v], from a textbook by an eminent linguist, is more acceptable than [i–iv],
but still cannot be covered by any established rule of grammar. The underlined verb is in a
relative clause whose subject has singular kind as antecedent, so the simple agreement rule
would predict is rather than are. The latter form matches the plurality of the sequence
variations of word-order and grammatical structure, and again the sentence could be
reformulated with this as antecedent for the relative clause: to control and interpret
the kind of variations of word-order and grammatical structure that are exemplified in the
sentences cited above.
Examples [7vi–vii] are fully acceptable and grammatical: they illustrate cases where
more specific rules require or permit the general rule of simple agreement to be overridden. We will survey a variety of such override constructions in §§18.2–3, and in §18.4
we look at the interaction between coordination and agreement.7218.2 Semantically motivated overrides with collective
and number-transparent nouns
Two of the most common overrides of the simple agreement rule are found with singular
collective nouns and with the number-transparent quantificational noun construction
introduced in §3.3 above:
[8]72singular collective as head of subject NP
i The committee has not yet come to a decision.
ii The committee have not yet come to a decision.[simple agreement]
[plural override]Examples like More than one glass was broken and One more application has been received than we had expected
([6] of §11) follow the simple agreement rule and hence do not need to be dealt with here: what is noteworthy
about such examples is the mismatch between the syntactic number of the subject NP and its meaning.","[520, 521]"
"§ 2 Coordinators and related linking items(d) Polarity and evaluation
Positive terms tend to precede negatives: yes and no, admit or deny , accept or refuse,
with or without. The concepts of positive and negative are extended to many scales of
evaluation, and it is again the positive (more highly valued) term that tends to come first:
good and bad , for [better or worse], friend or foe , right or wrong. The concepts are also
relevant to pairs like come and go and arrive and depart, where the positive–negative
contrast is a matter of being at a certain place and not being there.
(e) Social hierarchy
Another tendency is for the order to reflect social status: employers and employees ; officers
and men ; peers and commoners. Two special cases of this hierarchy rank adults above
children and males above females: father and son ; Mr and Mrs ; the Duke and Duchess of
Penzance; husband and wife; brothers and sisters; he or she; men, women, and children.
The male–female order is reversed, however, in Ladies and Gentlemen; bride and groom;
mums and dads.10 Precisely because the usual male–female order can be seen as reflecting
the social hierarchy, it can be regarded as a case of ‘sexism’ in language – and it may then
be consciously reversed for that reason; it has, however, received very much less attention
and criticism than more obvious cases of sexist language such as the use of masculine
terms like he to subsume females (Ch. 5, §17.2.4).","[1308, 1309]"
"§ 2 Distinctive grammatical properties of the major clause types Exclamatives[5]i Exclamatives contain an initial exclamative phrase, based on one or other of the
two exclamative words what and how.
ii They may be reduced to just a predicative exclamative phrase; otherwise they are
always tensed.
iii They usually have subject + predicator order, but subject postposing and
subject–auxiliary inversion are also possible.
[6] i What a disaster it was!
ii How great would be their embarrassment if the error were detected!
iii How happy would he be if he could see her once more!
iv What a disaster!
Examples [6i–iii] have fronting of a non-subject exclamative phrase; in [ii] this is accompanied by postposing of the subject their embarrassment and in [iii] by subject–auxiliary
inversion. In [iv] the clause is reduced to the exclamative phrase, understood predicatively
(“What a disaster it was!”).","[876, 877]"
"3.2.1 The passive and preposing constructions
Passive clauses and clauses with preposing differ from canonical clauses in radically
different ways. Compare:
[8] i She took the others.
ii The others were taken by her.
iii The others she took.[canonical]
[passive]
[preposing]We use examples with minimal lexical content in order to facilitate the manipulation
needed in applying the various tests. The others might be interpreted in context as “the
other photographs”, “the other lectures”, “the other books”, and so on. In [ii] the subject
function has clearly been reassigned from she to the others, whereas in [iii] she remains
subject and we simply have a special position for O – we may think of it as having been
preposed from its basic position. The difference is shown in the following table, which indicates for each of the two NPs whether or not it has the subject properties (b)–(i) of § 3.1.

In [8ii] the others is in subject position; in [iii] the others is in front position but it is still
she that occupies the basic S position, just preceding P.
(c) Case
In [8ii] the others can be replaced by nominative they ; in [iii] a personal pronoun replacing
the others would have to be accusative: Them, she took.
(d) Agreement
In [8ii] were agrees with the others ; in [iii] if we replace the preterite by the present we
get The others, she takes ; replacing she by you would yield The others, you take. The verb
agrees with she or you.
(e) Subject–auxiliary inversion
For [8ii] the form is Were the others taken by her? Preposing of a complement is extremely
rare in closed interrogatives (but not ungrammatical: we cannot exclude examples like I
did the first half; the second half should we leave for Pat to finish?). However, we can apply
the inversion test more clearly by taking another construction involving subject–auxiliary
inversion, namely one where the preposed element is negative, as in None of the others did
she take seriously. Again, it is she, not the preposed element, that behaves like a subject.
(f) Open interrogatives
For [8ii] we have Which ones were taken by her? For [iii], the criterion is not applicable (‘n/a’), since this kind of preposing is incompatible with the open interrogative
construction.
(g) Tags
The evidence from tags is straightforward. For [8ii], we get weren’t they?, where they has
the others as its antecedent. For [iii], we get didn’t she?
(h) Coordination
For [8ii] we can have the basic coordination The others were taken by her and gave us great
pleasure. In [iii] both S and O are external to the VP, and for this reason coordination
no longer distinguishes clearly between them – hence the entry ‘n/d’ (non-distinctive)
in the table. It is possible to have a coordination of VPs, as in The others she took and
published in a magazine, but the coordinates took and published in a magazine are not
ordinary VPs, as they do not contain the object; moreover it is also possible for O to
combine with a coordination, as in The others, she took but the editor rejected.
(i) Obligatoriness
The maximal finite reduction for [8ii] is They were; but this parameter is not applicable
to [iii], since if we reduce it to She did we no longer have a preposing construction.
The syntactic effect of preposing is thus merely to change the order of elements: it does
not affect the alignment of semantic roles with grammatical functions. Non-canonical
clauses of this kind, however, do not allow the full range of manipulation available in
canonical clauses. Passivisation, by contrast, does affect the role–function alignment: to
use the metaphor introduced above, it ‘promotes’ the element that is object in the active§ 3.2.2 The extraposition and existential constructionsto subject in the passive, and assigns the active subject the status of oblique within a
PP headed by by. This PP is a non-core complement we refer to as an internalised
complement, since it is internal to the VP but corresponds to the external complement
of the active; it is almost invariably omissible (compare [8ii] with The others were taken
afterwards).","[259, 260, 261]"
"237Chapter 4 The clause: complements238(f) Open interrogatives
The rules forming open interrogatives likewise distinguish sharply between subject and
non-subject elements:
[5]i Who bought it?
ii What did you buy?[interrogative element as subject: basic order]
[interrogative element as non-subject: inverted order]If the interrogative element is subject, the order is the same as in the declarative
(cf. Someone bought it), but if it is non-subject, then the interrogative element is usually
placed in front position, triggering subject–auxiliary inversion.
(g) Tags
Interrogative tags attached to a declarative clause contain a subject pronoun that agrees
with the subject of that clause:
[6] i You know the others, don’t you?
ii The candidates know the minister, don’t they?
The tag has the form of an elliptical closed interrogative consisting of auxiliary + personal
pronoun, the choice of pronoun being determined by the subject of the declarative: you
agrees with you in [i], they with the candidates in [ii] (see Ch. 10, §5.1). Note that this
holds even when the declarative clause does not have the elements in the basic order, as
in The others you know, don’t you?; Even clearer is the second point, isn’t it?
(h) Coordination
Since its default position is external to the VP, the subject can enter straightforwardly
into construction with a VP-coordination:
[7]Sue typed the letter and posted it herself.","[257, 258]"
"The distinctive property of particles is that they can precede the object, but in general they
don’t have to, so that we have alternation between the two clause structures illustrated in
[ia] and [iia]. In [ib], however, off the wall forms a single clause element, and the order
within this phrase is fixed.
Important though it is, this test is not as straightforward as (b) below: there are a
small number of alternations between transitive PPs and sequences of NP + intransitive
preposition (illustrated in [33] below), and also cases where a particle cannot be shifted
around the object (§6.3.1).
(b) Only a transitive preposition can be followed by an unstressed personal pronoun
The NP following a transitive preposition (its object) can have the form of an unstressed
personal pronoun, but the NP following a particle can’t: objects of this kind must immediately follow the governing verb.
[28]a. ∗She took off it.b. She jumped off it.",[301]
"‘Inversion’ in [iii] is short for ‘subject–dependent inversion’, as opposed to subject–
auxiliary inversion. In the particular example given here, there is inversion of the
subject two knives and the locative complement in the bag. In Soon afterwards came
the second package we have inversion of the subject and a temporal adjunct.
In [1i–iii] the only syntactic difference between the two versions is in the linear order
of the elements, whereas in [iv–vii] there are differences in syntactic function. In the
existential example, the dummy (semantically empty) pronoun there is subject, while
one guard is displaced subject, and similarly in the extraposition example the dummy
pronoun it is subject and that it’s a forgery is extraposed subject. The terms ‘displaced
subject’ and ‘extraposed subject’ denote elements which are not themselves subject but
which are interpreted semantically as though they were, and characteristically correspond
to the subject of the more basic construction. Extrapositional it can also appear in object
function, as in I find it strange that no one noticed the error ; in this case the embedded
content clause functions as extraposed object.
A cleft clause contains the elements of the more basic counterpart divided into two:
one (here a bee) is foregrounded and functions as complement of the verb be ; the other
(stung me) is backgrounded and placed in a subordinate (relative) clause. The example
in [1vi] is, more specifically, an it-cleft (having the dummy pronoun it as subject of be),
contrasting with the ‘pseudo-cleft’ What stung me was a bee, where the backgrounded
component is located in a fused relative construction.",[87]
"With you the subject-first order is strongly disfavoured, whereas with other, especially
longer, subjects, the subject-first order tends to be preferred and examples like [iib]
are somewhat marginal. Contrastiveness will tend to favour the subject-second order:
The girls can board now, but don’t the boys move until I say so. The choice may also be
determined by the scope of the negative:
[14] i One of you don’t forget to turn off the light.
ii Don’t one of you forget to sign the register.[narrow scope negation]
[wide scope negation]One is outside the scope of the negative in [i], inside in [ii]: the meanings can be
contrasted as “One of you remember to turn off the light” and “All of you remember to
sign the register”.",[948]
"247Chapter 4 The clause: complements2484.3 Ditransitive clauses
 Alternation with prepositional constructionMost ditransitive clauses have alternants with a single object and a PP complement with
to or for as head:
[7]ditransitive: S–P–Oi –Od
i a. I sent Sue a copy.
ii a. I ordered Sue a copy.monotransitive: S–P–Od –C
b. I sent a copy to Sue.
b. I ordered a copy for Sue.","[267, 268]"
"2.2.3 Asymmetric constructions, i: and (He got up and had breakfast, etc.)
Example [13iia], There is a copy on the desk and in the top drawer, is symmetric in
that it is equivalent to There is a copy in the top drawer and on the desk, where the
coordinates appear in the reverse order. Similarly for the corresponding example with
or and indeed the other examples considered in §§2.2.1–2. We have noted, however,
that the order of coordinates is not always reversible in this way, and where the different orders convey different meanings we will speak of the coordination as asymmetric. The fact that the orders are not interchangeable indicates that the linked
19If the coordination is moved to the front, as in this gloss, it will be unambiguously outside the scope of the
negative. Expanding the second coordinate by a modifier can also give the coordination wide scope, as in He
wasn’t at work on Monday or perhaps Tuesday.
20
The qualification ‘generally’ is needed because there is another possibility, involving gapping (§4.2), as in Kim
hadn’t been at home on Monday or Pat on Tuesday. Here or is within the scope of the negative in the first clause,
so that the meaning is “Kim hadn’t been at home on Monday and Pat hadn’t been at home on Tuesday”.",[1319]

"The postposed elements here are respectively subject, predicative complement, displaced
subject (in the existential construction), and direct object. For the subject the default
position is before the predicator, and for the other three functions it is immediately after
the predicator.

for heavy constituents to appear late in the clause. The examples in [1] may thus be§ 4 Postposingcontrasted with the structurally similar ones in the right-hand column of [2]; here the
postposed constituent is short, and the version with postposing is much less natural or

b. ?She seemed at that time sad.
b. ?There is in the fridge some milk.

#The felicity of a postposing depends not simply on the weight of the postposed constituent, but on the relative weights of it and the constituent over which it is
moved:

ii They never gave each other presents.
iii We sat opposite each other.
iv We must protect them from each other.
v I talked to Kim and Pat about each other.[subject; direct object]
[subject; indirect object]
[subject; comp of prep]
[object; comp of prep]
[comp of prep (both)]The annotations on the right give the functions of the antecedent and pronoun respectively; in [v] both have the function of complement of a preposition.26 As with reflexives,
the pronoun cannot have subject function: ∗Each other love Kim and Pat.
(b) Noun-domain reciprocals
[15] i We were alarmed at [their growing hostility to each other].
ii She wrote a poem about [the love of Karl and Sophie for each other].
iii The story is about [the love for each other of two teenage students who had both
been rejected by their parents].
Here antecedent and anaphor are related to the same noun, the pronoun by means of a
preposition, the antecedent by genitive case or a preposition. Example [iii] shows that
in this construction the pronoun can precede the antecedent.
 ExtensionsThe same types of extension are found with reciprocals as with reflexives, except that reciprocals are hardly possible as complement in the it-cleft construction: ?It was each other
that they criticised most harshly.
(a) Predicative adjective domain
[16] i They seem very fond of each other.
ii The competition had made them somewhat antagonistic towards each other.
The pronoun is oblique complement of a predicative adjective, and the antecedent is the
predicand – subject in [i], object in [ii].
(b) Subject of non-finite complement of verb
[17]
They arranged for each other to be nominated by one of the directors.
(c) Mixed verb–noun domain
[18] i They had had [nightmares about each other].
ii Lady Mary and Sir Harry had presented [portraits of each other] to the Gallery.
iii Kim and Pat sued [each other’s parents].
Examples [i–ii] are comparable to the reflexive examples [32–33]. In [18iii] the reciprocal
is genitive subject-determiner to the noun parents, while the antecedent is subject of the
verb sue; this pattern is much more common than that of [i–ii] but, as we have observed,
has no reflexive counterpart because reflexives do not have genitive forms. Note that
in the mixed verb–noun domain it is not possible for the antecedent to be a genitive
(∗The girls’ assignments had been typed by each other); genitive antecedents are found only
in noun-domain anaphora, as in [15i].
26As with reflexives, the preferred order in [14v] has the to phrase before the about phrase: ? I talked about Kim
and Pat to each other.","[1522, 1523]"
"3 Speech and writing
There are significant and interesting differences between spoken and written language,
but we do not regard written English as a different language from spoken English. In
general, we aim to describe both the written standard variety that is encountered in
contemporary newspapers, magazines, and books and the spoken standard variety that
is heard on radio and television programmes in English-speaking countries.
 ‘Speaker’ and ‘utterance’ as medium-neutral termsMost of what we say will apply equally to the spoken and written varieties of the language.
As there is no non-technical term covering both one who utters a sentence in speech
and one who writes a sentence, we will follow the widespread practice in linguistics
of extending the ordinary sense of ‘speaker’ so as to subsume ‘writer’ – a practice that
reflects the fact that speech is in important respects more basic than writing.4 We likewise
take ‘utterance’ to be neutral between the mediums, so that we will refer to both spoken
and written utterances.
 Practical bias towards written EnglishDespite our neutrality between speech and writing in principle, there are at least three
reasons why the reader may perceive something of a bias in this work towards data from
3The computer corpora that we have made use of are the Brown corpus of a million words of American English;
the Lancaster/Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of British English; the Australian Corpus of English (ACE); and the
Wall Street Journal corpus distributed by the Association for Computational Linguistics. The British National
Corpus (BNC) was only released to scholars working outside the UK after the book was in final draft. We have
also drawn on a variety of other sources, including collections of our own from sources such as magazines,
newspapers, plays, books, and film scripts.
4
Since our discussion of sentences will very often make reference to the way they are used we will have very
frequent occasion to talk of speakers, and in order to avoid repeatedly using the term ‘speaker’ we will often
simply use the 1st person pronoun I . Given that the book has joint authorship this pronoun could not be used
in reference to any specific person, and hence is available as a convenient variant of ‘the speaker’.",[31]
"101102Chapter 3 The verb
 Position of adverbsAuxiliaries differ from lexical verbs in their position relative to various adverbs, notably
frequency adverbs (such as always, usually, often, sometimes, never) and modal adverbs
(such as possibly, probably, certainly). Such adverbs tend to precede lexical verbs but to
follow auxiliaries:
[35]
lexical verb
auxiliary verb
i a. He always looks miserable.
b. He is always miserable.
ii a. They probably go by bus.
b. They have probably gone by bus.
With lexical verbs the opposite ordering (with the adverb following the verb and preceding its complement) is excluded: ∗He looks always miserable; ∗They go probably by bus.13
With auxiliaries the verb + adverb order shown above is the usual one, but the reverse
order of adverb + verb is also possible: compare He always is miserable; They probably
have gone by bus. One special case where the latter order might be found is with emphatic
polarity, with stress on the auxiliary.
 Quantificational adjunctsA comparable difference in position between auxiliaries and lexical verbs is found with
certain determinatives, such as all, both, each (Ch. 5, §9.2), that are semantically associated
with the subject:
[36]lexical verb
i a. All the players took a card.

" Dimensions of contrast between canonical and non-canonical constructionsThe examples in [1] illustrate five major dimensions of contrast between canonical and
non-canonical clauses. In each case the canonical clause is syntactically more basic or
elementary than the non-canonical one.
The examples in [1i] differ in polarity, with [a] positive and [b] negative. In this
example, the negative differs from the positive not just by virtue of the negative marker
not but also by the addition of the semantically empty auxiliary do.
The contrast in [1ii] is one of clause type, with [a] declarative and [b] interrogative.
The syntactic difference in this particular pair concerns the relative order of subject and
predicator: in [a] the subject occupies its basic or default position before the predicator,
while in [b] the order is inverted. In the pair She finished the work and Did she finish the
work? the interrogative differs from the declarative both in the order of elements and
in the addition of the auxiliary do. All canonical clauses are declarative; non-canonical
clauses on this dimension also include exclamatives (What a shambles it was!) and imperatives (Sit down).
In [1iii], canonical [a] is active while [b] is passive. These clauses differ strikingly in
their syntactic form, but their meanings are very similar: there is a sense in which they
represent different ways of saying the same thing. More precisely, they have the same
propositional content, but differ in the way the information is presented – or ‘packaged’.
The passive is one of a number of non-canonical constructions on this dimension. Others
include preposing (e.g. Most of them we rejected, contrasting with canonical We rejected
most of them), the existential construction (e.g. There were several doctors on board,
contrasting with Several doctors were on board ), and the it-cleft (e.g. It was Pat who spoke
first, contrasting with Pat spoke first).
The underlined clause in [1ivb] is subordinate, whereas [a] is a main clause. In this
example, the non-canonical clause is distinguished simply by the presence of the subordinator that, but many kinds of subordinate clause differ from main clauses more§ 2 Canonical and non-canonical clausesradically, as for example in This tool is very easy to use, where the subordinate clause
consists of just the VP subordinator to together with the predicator, with both subject
and object left unexpressed. The clause in which a subordinate clause is embedded is
called the matrix clause – in [ivb], for example, subordinate that Liz was ill is embedded
within the matrix clause He said that Liz was ill. Subordination is recursive, i.e. repeatable,
so that one matrix clause may be embedded within a larger one, as in I think he said that
Liz was ill.
Finally, the underlined clause in [1vb] is coordinate, in contrast to non-coordinate
[a]; it is marked as such by the coordinator or. A greater departure from canonical
structure is seen in Jill works in Paris, and her husband in Bonn, where the predicator
works is missing.
It is of course possible for non-canonical constructions to combine, as in:
[2]I can’t understand why I have not been questioned by the police.","[66, 67]"
"§ 5.3.3 Dubitativesonly a declarative or an open interrogative (Considering what the conditions were like, it
was a creditable performance, but not ∗Considering whether it was her first attempt, . . . ).
Similarly with given, except that here the verb from which it is converted does not take
content clause complements at all.
Non-factive careful, take care behave in the same way: Be careful what you say but not
∗
Be careful whether they see you. Instead of the latter we need a declarative: Be careful they
see / don’t see you.
 Subject–auxiliary inversionSome varieties of English (quite widespread in the USA) allow subordinate interrogatives
with subject–auxiliary inversion in contexts of strong question-orientation:
[44]inverted order
i a. She asked what had she done wrong.
ii a. % He wanted to know was she ill.
iii a. ∗ He didn’t know was she ill.
%uninverted order
b. She asked what she had done wrong.
b. He wanted to know if she was ill.
b. He didn’t know if she was ill.","[1002, 1003]"
"249Chapter 4 The clause: complements250(c) Object postposing
Unlike monotransitive Od and ditransitive Od , Oi cannot be postposed when heavy:
[11] i He gave to charity everything he earned from the concert.
[monotransitive Od ]
[ditransitive Od ]
ii He gave Sue immediately all the spare keys he had had cut.
∗
[Oi ]
iii He gave a second chance all those who had scored 40% or more.
The ban on S–P–Od –Oi is comparable to that on O–P–S. Order is the primary factor distinguishing Oi from Od as well as S from O, and the grammar excludes structures which reverse
the normal Oi –Od and S–P–O orders.
(d) Prenuclear position
As we have seen in [9], clauses with prenuclear Oi are of low acceptability, whereas ditransitive Od occurs as readily in this position as monotransitive Od – compare the [a]
examples with The key he lost, The key which he tried didn’t fit, He asked who(m)I had invited,
What a lot of them he had offended!
(e) Predicand
Unlike monotransitive Od and ditransitive Od , Oi cannot be the predicand for a predicative
adjunct:
[12] i She ate the steak almost raw.
ii He served her her steak almost raw.
iii ∗He offered her the steak fiendishly hungry.[monotransitive Od as predicand]
[ditransitive Od as predicand]
[Oi as predicand]In [i–ii] the property expressed by the adjunct almost raw is predicated of the steak, expressed
as Od , but [iii] illustrates the impossibility of having Oi as predicand: it can’t mean that
she was in a state of fiendish hunger as he offered her the steak (the asterisk applies to this
interpretation: it is grammatical with the subject he as predicand).
(f) Control
In infinitival purpose clauses an O can be left unexpressed if it is recoverable from the
superordinate clause O – which is said to ‘control’ the gap, or missing element. The controlling
element can be monotransitive Od or ditransitive Od , but not Oi :
[13] i He wanted it to spend on his children.
ii She gave him it to spend on his children.
iii ∗She sent him it to prove wrong.[monotransitive Od as controller]
[ditransitive Od as controller]
[Oi as controller]In [i–ii] we understand to spend on his children as “to spend it on his children”: there is
a missing O (a gap marked by ‘ ’) recoverable from the Od it of want or give. But [iii],
where the intended interpretation is “She sent him it to prove him wrong”, thus with Oi as
controller, is ungrammatical. (The infinitivals here are ‘hollow clauses’: see Ch. 14, §6, for
further discussion.)
Conclusion
On balance, ditransitive Od has greater syntactic affinity with monotransitive Od than
does Oi , justifying our analysis of the canonical double-object construction as containing Oi + Od .26 The most important distinctive property of Oi is (d), its resistance to front
26Some modern grammars take the opposite view, regarding the first internal complement as Od and the second
as not an O at all. Languages with a ditransitive construction fall broadly into two types, one where the O
which characteristically has a recipient role behaves syntactically like a monotransitive O, and one where it§ 5 Predicatives and related elementsposition, for (e)–(f) involve fairly infrequent constructions and certainly don’t apply to all
Od s.
 Oi not found in canonical clauses without OdIn canonical clauses containing just one object, that object is always a direct object, even
if it corresponds semantically to the indirect object of a ditransitive clause:
[14] i She teaches the first-year students introductory logic.
[Oi + Od ]
d
ii She teaches introductory logic.
[O , with semantic role of ditransitive Od ]
iii She teaches the first-year students.
[Od , with semantic role of ditransitive Oi ]
Although the semantic roles of introductory logic in [ii] and the first-year students in
[iii] are different, there is no syntactic basis for assigning different structures to these
clauses. Except in certain non-canonical constructions (such as the passive), therefore,
Oi is found only in combination with Od .
Note, in support of this analysis, that the internal complement in [14iii] does not
have the major Oi property of resisting prenuclear position: These students she has never
taught, the students whom she taught, Who does she teach?, What a lot of first-class students
she taught! are completely acceptable, just like the equivalent constructions based on [ii],
Logic she has never taught, the subject which she taught, and so on. The case is comparable
to that involving different kinds of relation between monotransitive and intransitive
constructions:
[15] i She rang the bell twice.
[S + Od ]
ii She rang twice.
[S, with semantic role of monotransitive S]
iii The bell rang twice.
[S, with semantic role of monotransitive Od ]
It is uncontroversial that she in [ii] and the bell in [iii] have the same syntactic function,
subject, even though the semantic roles are different, and we are saying that introductory logic in [14ii] and the first-year students in [14iii] likewise have the same syntactic
function, this time direct object, in spite of the semantic difference.","[269, 270, 271]"
"We are of course concerned here with make as a complex-transitive verb (“cause to be”):
other uses of make allow PPs, but not as predicative complement.
Seem, appear, etc., allow predicative PPs with idiomatic meanings, such as in a bad
temper, in good working order, in good shape, out of control, under the weather. But even
these are normally excluded by become and make: compare He seems in a bad temper ;
∗
He became in a bad temper ; ∗This made him in a bad temper.
 Predicative adjuncts in front position: the predicand requirementPredicatives require an overt or understood predicand. In Kim seemed sad, the predicand
is the subject Kim; in I consider his behaviour outrageous, it is the object his behaviour;
and in Be careful, it is the understood 2nd person subject.
This requirement provides the basis for distinguishing between adjectives and prepositions functioning as head of a phrase in front position in the clause. Compare:
[8]i Upset, the children had daubed paint on the walls.
ii Upstairs, the children had daubed paint on the walls.",[550]

"2.1 Properties of prototypical coordinators
(a) Unlimited number of coordinates
Arguably the most important distinctive property of coordination is that there is no
grammatical limit to the number of coordinates that can be joined in a single layer of
coordination.
10The order in Ladies and Gentlemen is widely felt to be a matter of conventional politeness, though historically
it may be related to the origin of lady as the female counterpart of lord and hence higher in the social hierarchy
than gentleman. There is also a historical explanation for bride and groom : the second term derives from
bride’s groom, which followed bride because it is defined in terms of its relation to the latter. With names,
the male–female hierarchy is likely to take second place to the pragmatic principle of ordering according to
primary interest: in a context where Kim and Pat are married, for example, Kim’s parents are likely to refer to
them as Kim and Pat, Pat’s as Pat and Kim, and so on.",[1309]
"In both pairs the order of the underlined constituents is reversed, and this reversal is subject
to the constraint that the one that comes to occupy first position must not be less familiar in
the discourse than the one that comes to occupy a later position.",[1464]
"∗(b) Insertion of adjunct (climbed slowly up ∼ ∗gave slowly up)
In free combinations, adjuncts (e.g. of manner) can be inserted before an intransitive
preposition in complement function, but this possibility is greatly reduced in idioms, as
seen in:
[39] i a. She climbed slowly up.
b. She led him triumphantly out.
∗
ii a. She gave slowly up.
b. ∗She knocked him triumphantly out.
Adjuncts before intransitive prepositions are not excluded altogether: we can have They
pressed resolutely on or It faded gradually away, contrasting with ∗They carried resolutely
on or ∗He passed gradually away (“died”), and so on. But in general the close association
between the verb + preposition sequence inhibits this kind of separation, and the further
the meaning is from that of a literal combination the less likely it is that such insertion
will be acceptable.
(c) Order alternation (took off the label ∼ took the label off )
As we noted in §6.2, intransitive prepositions can generally either precede or follow
the object of the verb: compare [27ia/iia], She took off the label ∼ She took the label off.
There are some cases, however, where the intransitive preposition can only precede the
object (unless the latter can have the form of an unstressed personal pronoun), and this
restriction can be seen as a clear case of fossilisation: the lexical unity bars the usual
syntactic separability. In the following examples the order alternation is permitted in
one sense of the verb + prepositional particle combination but not, or at best only very
marginally, in another – and the fossilised one is clearly further removed from the literal
meaning of the components:
[40] i a. He carried out the chairs.
ii a. He carried out his threat.
iii a. He put on his hat.
iv a. He put on an act.b. He carried the chairs out.
b. ? He carried his threat out.
b. He put his hat on.
b. ? He put an act on.",[305]
" Reanalysis of for as subordinatorThe item for that appears with to-infinitivals differs in important ways from the one
that takes NP complements. Although traditional grammars and dictionaries classify it
as a preposition, there are strong grounds for analysing it as a subordinator, with the
following NP functioning as subject of the infinitival VP. The subordinator for does for
infinitival clauses with subjects what the subordinator that does for finite content clauses.
(a) Occurrence of to-infinitivals in non-PP positions
In spite of the similarities illustrated in [36], for clauses commonly appear in places that do
not allow for PPs:
[38] i For you to give up now would be tragic.
ii It’s rare for the bus to be so late.
iii This made it necessary for the meeting to be postponed.
iv I can’t afford for them to see me like this.[subject]
[extraposed subject]
[extraposed object]
[complement of afford]Most importantly, they occur as subject or as extraposed subject/object, as in [i–iii]: PPs do not
appear in extraposed position and appear as subject only under highly restrictive conditions.
In addition, [iv] shows that the class of verbs taking for clause complements is not limited to
those allowing for PPs: while [iv] is grammatical, ∗I can’t afford for an investigation is not (cf.
also agree and say).
(b) Range of subject NPs
Except for the matter of accusative case, the NPs following for are the same as those which
occur as subject of finite main clauses. Note in particular that dummy there occurs freely§ 1.4.2 The infinitival subordinator tohere though it can’t occur as complement in a for PP, and the same applies to numerous NPs
that form parts of idioms:
[39] i It’s essential for there to be no misunderstanding on this point.
ii He called for close tabs to be kept on the new recruits.
(c) Constituent structure
It is clear that for + NP + VP forms a constituent – the subject of [38i], for example, is
uncontroversially for you to give up now, and similarly for the other examples cited.8 Within
this sequence there is no reason to say that the NP combines directly with for ; rather the NP
and VP combine to form a clause nucleus showing the same range of contrasts as a main
clause – or as a clause nucleus following the subordinator that :
[40] i It’s necessary [for both your parents to sign the form].
ii It’s necessary [for the form to be signed by both your parents].
iii It’s necessary [for your parents both to sign the form].
The underlined clauses in [i] and [ii] contrast as active vs passive, while that in [iii] contrasts
with [i] with respect to the position of both: the NP following for behaves like an ordinary
clause subject.
(d) Absolute initial position and contrast with that
For must occupy initial position in the subordinate clause. We have noted that it can’t occur
in the interrogative and wh relative constructions [22]: this is because the initial position is
there pre-empted by the interrogative subordinator whether and the interrogative and relative
phrases. Its syntactic role is therefore closely parallel to that of the finite clause subordinator
that, which is likewise excluded from interrogative and wh relative constructions. Like that,
for has no identifiable meaning of its own, but serves as a syntactic marker of a particular
syntactic construction. The functional similarity to that is particularly clear in such pairs as
the following, where we find a direct contrast between finite and infinitival clauses:
[41] i a. It is important that detailed records be kept.
b. It is important for detailed records to be kept.
ii a. That’s the best course that you can take.
b.That’s the best course for you to take.
iii a. In order that the bill may be passed major amendments were made.
b. In order for the bill to be passed major amendments were made.","[1202, 1203]"
"5.2 Modification
In this section we survey the kinds of modifier found in the structure of PPs.
(a) Idiomatic PPs with gradable meanings
We have seen that there are a number of idiomatic PPs that are gradable, and as far as
their external syntax is concerned they bear significant resemblances to adjectives – PPs
such as in a bad temper, in control, out of sorts, out of order, on top of the world. These take
degree expressions as modifier:
[25] i She seemed [completely in control of the situation].
ii That remark was [wholly out of order].
iii I was feeling [very much out of sorts].
For the choice between very much and very or too much and too, see Ch. 6, §2.2.
20To a certain extent, beyond behaves in a similar way, as in this AusE example: He is understood to have been
given no assurances [beyond that the Coalition did not believe Labor’s cross-media regulations were effective]
(corresponding to He was given the assurance that the Coalition did not believe Labor’s cross-media regulations
were effective).",[663]
"10891090Chapter 12 Relative constructions and unbounded dependenciesThese have the same grammatical structure, differing only lexically, with [i] having
write and [ii] despise as the verb of the relative clause. But they differ significantly in
acceptability: [i] is clearly acceptable, while [ii] is very unnatural. This difference has a
semantic explanation. The relative clause combines with the antecedent subject to form a
nominal that denotes a class of subjects. In the case of [i], this class has some coherence:
to say of some subject that Steven Jay Gould wrote a book about it points to a selection
of significant topics in areas like evolutionary biology, geology, palaeontology, etc. The
class denoted by the nominal in [ii] has no such coherence. What would have to be true
of a subject in order for it to be an x such that Steven Jay Gould despises a book about x ?
Someone, at some time in history, has to have written a book about x that Gould despises
for some reason (it is badly written, or was plagiarised, or has annoyingly pretentious
page design, or is full of mistakes, or whatever reason there might be). The subject in
question could be shoes, ships, sealing wax, cabbages, or kings. In other words, there is
no sensible characterisation of a class of subjects in [ii] at all, and as a result the example
seems anomalous.
Let us turn now to the review of constituent types. In the examples, we use one pair
of square brackets to delimit the constituent in question, and another to delimit the
unbounded dependency construction if it is less than the whole sentence. Antecedents
are underlined if they contain more than the one word that carries the subscript index.
(a) VP in predicate function
[34] i Most of the criticismsi he [accepted i with good grace].
ii I don’t know [wherei he [found it i ]].
iii It was to her cousini [that she [sold the business i ]].
VP predicates readily allow gaps within them. In [i] we have a preposing with a direct
object gap, in [ii] an open interrogative with an adjunct gap, and in [iii] a cleft relative
with a complement gap linked to a PP antecedent.
(b) AdjPs in predicative complement function
[35] i Whether it’s ethicali I’m not [so certain i ].
ii That’s the only crime [of whichi they could find him [guilty i ]].
Example [i] has preposing of a clausal complement of certain. In [ii] the relative PP of
which is antecedent to the gap functioning as complement of guilty.
(c) Declarative content clause in post-head complement function
[36] i It was herei [she said [she found the knife i ]].
ii I don’t know [whoi he thinks [he is i ]].
iii Here’s a booki [I think [ i might help us]].
iv He’s the only onei [that I’m [sure she told i ]].
Gaps are readily allowed here: an adjunct in [i], predicative complement in [ii], subject in
[iii], object in [iv]. The adjunct case has the potential for ambiguity. In the interpretation
indicated by the inner brackets in [i], the gap belongs in the find clause: it is a matter of
where she found the knife. The gap could also be in the say clause: It was herei [she said [she
found the knife] i ]. In this interpretation it is a matter of where her utterance took place.","[1109, 1110]"
"§ 1.4 Order of coordinates1.4 Order of coordinates
 Reversible and irreversible coordinationIn the simplest cases, the order of bare coordinates is free, so that we can change the
order without discernible effect on interpretation or acceptability:
[34] i She [was very bright and had a warm personality].
ii She [had a warm personality and was very bright].","[1306, 1307]"
"As evident from the above examples, the exclamative feature percolates upwards in
the same way as the interrogative feature; in [1iia], for example, it goes from what to the
NP what strange people, while in [2i] it goes from how to the AdvP how impossibly, and
thence to the AdjP how impossibly polite. It may percolate up into a PP or stop at the NP
complement, leaving the preposition stranded:
[3]i With what unedifying haste he accepted the offer!
ii What unsavoury people he associates with![fronting of preposition]
[stranding of preposition] Ambiguity between exclamative and open interrogativeHow and what can be either exclamative or interrogative, and in abstraction from the
prosody/punctuation such examples as [1ia/iia] are ambiguous between an exclamative
reading (“A remarkably large amount remains to be done”; “Remarkably strange people
inhabit these parts”) and an open interrogative reading (“What is the amount that
remains to be done?”; “Who are the strange people that inhabit these parts?”). Where
the clause is not ambiguous, as in the other examples given above, this is due to the
distributional differences between exclamative and interrogative how and what or to
differences in the order of elements in the clause. We will consider the exclamative words
in the next two subsections, and then take up the issue of order.
Whereas there are a fair number of interrogative words, the exclamative class has
only two members, how and what: clauses like Who remains to be seen? or Which strange
people inhabit these parts? are unambiguously interrogative. Like interrogative words,
exclamative how and what have a dual role: on one dimension they are markers of
exclamative clause type, but they also have what we are calling a core role. And in
their core role they show some differences from their interrogative counterparts in both
grammar and meaning.",[938]
"993994Chapter 11 Content clauses and reported speech
 Alternatives to the subjunctive constructionIn none of the above three cases is the subjunctive construction obligatory. Two other
possibilities have to be considered, as in the [b/c] examples in:
[2]i a. It is essential [that everyone attend the meeting].
b. It is essential [that everyone attends the meeting].
c. It is essential [that everyone should attend the meeting].
ii a. They must co-operate in order [that the system operate effectively.]
b. They must co-operate in order [that the system operates effectively.]
c. They must co-operate in order [that the system may operate effectively.]The [b] examples are ordinary declaratives, while [ic/iic] belong to what we call the
specialised-modal construction. This involves a use of a modal auxiliary that cannot
be identified with one of the uses characteristic of main clauses. The should of [ic],
for example, is not the same as that seen in the main clause Everyone should attend the
meeting : the latter does not accurately express the content of our demand since the should
here is weaker than in [ic], allowing that not everyone will necessarily attend. Similarly
the may of [iic] is not interpreted like that of the main clause The system may operate
effectively, where it conveys epistemic possibility. The ordinary declarative contains a
present tense or preterite non-modal verb or else a modal auxiliary with a sense that
it can also have in a main clause: compare, for example, subjunctive It is essential that
everyone be able to see the screen with ordinary declarative It is essential that everyone is
able to / can see the screen.
 Distinguishing the subjunctive from an ordinary declarativeThe subjunctive construction contains the plain form of the verb, which is overtly distinct
from a present tense only with the verb be or a 3rd person singular subject:
[3]i be as verb
ii 3rd sg subject
iii otherIt’s vital that they are kept informed.
It’s vital that he keep them informed.
It’s vital that he keeps them informed.
It’s vital that they be kept informed.","[1013, 1014]"
"It is clear that the third and ninth words are not distinct: they are tokens (instances) of the
same word. But what about hard and harder: are these the same word or different words?
The answer depends on what you mean by ‘word’. In one sense they are obviously
different: harder has a suffix that is missing from hard. This enables it to occur in
constructions like that of Your sister works harder than you, where it could not be replaced
by hard; and conversely hard could not be replaced by harder in Your sister works very
hard. So from a syntactic point of view they are different words. But there’s another
sense in which they are traditionally said to be ‘different forms of the same word’. The
perspective this time is that of the dictionary, which would have just one entry, labelled
hard. The same applies to are and is in [14]: syntactically these are different words, but
lexically (i.e. as far as the dictionary is concerned) they are the same. In order to avoid
possible misunderstanding we will restrict the term word to the syntactically-oriented
sense, so that hard and harder are different words, and likewise are and is. For the more
abstract, lexically-oriented sense we will use the term lexeme. Hard and harder are then
forms of the same lexeme, as are are and is.
In many cases it makes no difference whether we take a syntactic or a lexical perspective. Lexemes such as the and and are invariable, i.e. there is only one word corresponding
to each. Also invariable are lexemes like efficiently: although more efficiently is in some
respects like harder, it is not a single word, but a sequence of two, and hence efficiently
and more efficiently are not forms of a single lexeme. Variable lexemes, by contrast, are
those which have two or more forms. Where we need to make clear that we are considering an item as a lexeme, not a word, we will represent it in bold italics. Hard, for
example, represents the lexeme which has hard and harder – and also hardest – as its
forms.13 Similarly are and is, along with be, been, being, etc., are forms of the lexeme
be. In example [14], then, we have two occurrences of the lexeme hard, but only one of
the word hard, and of course just one of the word harder. A variable lexeme is thus a
word-sized lexical item considered in abstraction from grammatical properties that vary
depending on the syntactic construction in which it appears.
The variation found in variable lexemes is known, more specifically, as inflection,
and the various forms are called inflectional forms of the lexeme. For the most part,
inflectional categories apply to large sets of lexemes. Almost all verb lexemes, for example,
inflect for tense (e.g. preterite took vs present tense take), most nouns inflect for number
(e.g. singular dog vs plural dogs), many adjectives one or two syllables in length inflect for
grade (e.g. plain old vs comparative older vs superlative oldest). The inflectional contrast
of nominative case vs accusative case (e.g. we vs us), however, applies to just a handful
of pronoun lexemes.
13We minimise the use of bold type for lexemes, because in many cases it would simply distract. If we are simply
listing adjective lexemes that can occur in the construction They are difficult to please, for example, we will
generally list them as ‘difficult, easy, hard, impossible, tough’, etc., rather than ‘difficult, easy, hard, impossible,
tough’, etc.; the fact that easy is inflectionally variable and difficult invariable has no relevance in that context.",[47]
