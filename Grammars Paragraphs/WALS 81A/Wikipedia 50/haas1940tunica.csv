"HANDBOOKOF5.22AMERICANTHEINDIANPURPOSIVELANGUAGES71SUFFIXThe purposive suffix -wan “‘in order to . . .”’ is added to noncausative or causative infinitives (4.51 and 4.541). The resultant
form may be inflected for pronominal object (4.56) but not for
pronominal subject, e.g.,
2u'kiwan ya'k?ahkint.(12:e) I have come to stay; ?u/kiwan< ?u’ki to sit, dwell, stay + -wan
na'rawan ?a'm ?uwana'ni. (15:f) he wanted to leave in order
to fly; na’rawan < na’ra to fly + -wanmu’ éusina’ni, ?uhta’piwan. (4a:ay) they were diving in order
to catch him; ?uhta’piwan < ?uhk-, 3ms pref., + ta’pi to
catch + -wanAs is illustrated in the above examples a purposive form may be
freely used as the complement of any verb. In addition it is often
used as the complement of an active verb form built on the stem
ya’ “to do, make, commit” giving a somewhat idiomatic construc-tion having the meaning ‘‘to try to, intend to; start to” (< the
literal meaning ‘‘to do in order to’), e.g.,
ta’ st?ekiin, ?uhke’héawan yako'ni.
to bite him; ?uhke'hédawan(13:h) the horse was trying
< ?uhk- + ke’héa to bite+ -wanra’puwan ya'wthé (42F) when he intended to sleep; ra’puwan
< ra’pu to sleep + -wan
lo'tawan ya'tthé (9:}) when she starts to run; lo/tawan < lo’ta
to run + -wan
5.23THELINKINGOFACTIVEVERBSTEMS5.231
Two or more active verb stems having the same logical
subject are often linked together, the subjective inflection being
provided in connection with the last stem only. In all cases this
linkage constitutes a copulative construction ! comparable to the
copulative noun stem plus noun stem composites discussed in 5.433.
The events expressed by the different stems may be simultaneous or consecutive. If simultaneous, the stems may occur in anyorder, e.g.,
ha’raht' putthé (38: d) when she sang and danced; based on ha'ra
to sing + hi’pu to dance
tira’pape’k?uhke’nt. (9:1) He hit her and killed her; based on
ra’pa to kill+ pe’ka to hit; note that since the events aresimultaneous it is not necessary to place pe’ka first
kipa'tamu’ €?uhke'nt.
(16:1) he dived and fell in; based on
pa'ta to fall + mu’éu to dive; contrast with kimu’'éupa’tawe’nt (16:m) wherein the order of the stems is reversed.

"But inasmuch as the position of certain predicate modifiers is relatively free (rule 8 below), it sometimes happens that the independent subject follows a predicate modifier, e.g.,

(9:g) then when the little one got up very earlyMoreover, in case it is desired to give especial emphasis to the
independent subject it may be placed after the predicative word.

before the predicative word. In such a case the independent object and the predicative word will often be included in the same
phrase, i.e., will not be separated by phrasing. Note also that the
independent object will normally follow the independent subject
if both are expressed in the same clause, e.g.,
(1s) ta’rustaéku,(10) to’mahkak(pw)?uwe’niwthé (14421) whenRabbit found the alligatorIf the independent object is expressed but the independent subject is not expressed, the independent object will then normally
stand at the beginning of the clause unless a sentence connective

CHAPTER7.6 Order...",[7]
"In certain cases more than one postfix may be attached to the
same word and in this event their order is fixed (9.37).",[115]
"In all other cases -tan is used in connection with the negative postfix -?aha (no. 17 below) with the force of a prohibitive. Prohibitive forms are not inflected; in other words, -?aha + -tan (in this
order) are added directly to active verb infinitives, e.g.,
2uhpe'k?ahatan.",[118]
"(10:Mc)?uha’ytk(Pw:Mc)he got to the house,the oldBut even though there is a strong tendency to place the predicative word at the end of the sentence or clause, this order is not toorigidly adhered to. For example, certain predicate modifiers are
permitted to stand after the predicative word although they are
just as likely to be placed before it (rule 8 below). It should be
noted, however, that this freedom is applied most frequently in
the case of the predicative word of a main clause and rarely in the
case of the predicative word of a subordinate clause. In addition
to the possibility of placing certain types of predicate modifiers
after the predicative word, we find that the independent subject
may occasionally follow this word (see rule 3 below).
Rule 3. The independent subject tends to precede all other
syntactic elements in the clause except the sentence connective,
e.g.,(sc) hinya’tthé, (1s) tu’wak (pw) ?u'wako'ni.(20:e) Then theowl hooted, it is said.(sc) hinya’tihé, (1s) ?u’win, (pm) ?u'rig (pw) lo’t?am?uhke’nt.

non-amalgamated form, viz., ta’hkala’yihta (e.g., in 4B:bk) ‘‘on
the bank, shore” < ta’hkal- ‘‘the bank, shore” + (h)a’ythta. Except for this one word amalgamations are probably to be considered as characteristic only of careless or allegro speech. They
would seem to result from a habit comparable to the English one
known as “running one’s words together.”
2.35STRESSLOSSESAs in the case of the word, two stressed syllables may not occur
consecutively within the phrase.",[30]
"7.46 Adverbial clauses are ‘‘where”’ clauses or locative clauses.
These may modify the predicative word of either a main or a dendent clause.
‘‘Where” clauses contain the interrogativeindefinite adverb ka’ta (5.75) which may introduce the clause or
else be placed immediately before the verb. Such clauses also have
the subordinating postfix -hé attached to their verb, e.g.,
(Is:Mc)se’mdn,(Pw:Mc)?a’tane’ni,(pM: ac) ka’tén,(PW: Ac)?u'kika’tahé. (9:b) They came, it is said, (to the place)

-§1 “‘at, to”’ attached to their predicative word (4.855), e.g.,

7.5TasSyntactic
7.51ELEMENTSGENERALOFTHECLAUSEREMARKSThe syntactic elements of the clause are as follows: a predica-tive word, an independent subject, an independent object, a
subject or object modifier, a predicate modifier, a predicate complement, and a sentence connective. Every clause (except one
consisting of a quantificative, 10.21, or an exclamative or imitative,
10.7) must have a predicative word and may consist only of this
word. In addition to a predicative word a clause may contain anyof the remaining syntactic elements (except a subject or object
modifier) or any combination of these (including a subject or object modifier when the modified element is also present). In most
Cases the syntactic elements are words, but subject or object modi-fiersandpredicatecomplementsarewordsor clauses,whilePredicate modifiers are words, phrases, or clauses.
} In this case the predicate modifier consists of two words comprising a postpositional phrase (10:3).",[92]
"These word-classes or special combina-tions thereof (i.e., phrases or clauses) may serve in one or more of
the following syntactic functions: as predicative words, as independent subjects, as independent objects, as subject or object
modifiers, as predicate modifiers, as predicate complements, and

(10.21) and in still other cases they stand in apposition to the
noun (7.591).

used in this way are adjectives, comparatives, adverbs, and locative nouns. Phrases and clauses used in this way are always adverbial.
Adjectives are used as modifiers of noun predicative words,

may be either words or clauses. Words used in this way are independent personal pronouns, nouns, interrogative-indefinite pronouns, quantificatives, adjectives, and active verb infinitives.
Independent personal pronouns, nouns, and interrogativeindefinite pronouns are used as complements of static verb predicatives or of impersonal or transimpersonal active verb predicatives, e.g.,

4.61orGENERALTHEACTIVEVERBREMARKSActive verbs (both non-causative and causative) fall into four
sub-classes: intransitive, transitive, impersonal, and transimpersonal. While none of these sub-classes makes use of any special
inflectional elements, each of them (except the transitive) is restricted in a different way as to which of the total number of inflectional elements it may use. Thus intransitives are inflected
only for pronominal subject while transitives normally undergo.
additional inflection for pronominal object.
Impersonals differ
from intransitives in that they may be inflected only for a third
person feminine pronominal subject. Transimpersonals are like
impersonals in inflection for subject but undergo further inflectionfor pronominal object.",[55]
"The auxiliary verbs have the following unique characteristics:
(1) All of them exhibit the same general types of irregularities ininflection, namely, that certain forms are inflected like non-inchoative static verbs, others like non-causative active verbs in the
semelfactive aspect, while still others are unanalyzable. (2) Certain of these irregularities are occasioned by the use of supple-tion, a process not used by any other word-class of the language.
(3) Reduplication is regularly employed in the formation of their
repetitive paradigms, and, like suppletion, is not used elsewhere in
the language. (4) All of these verbs are employed in the periphrastic inflection of active verbs although all but one of them
may also be used independently.
Thecharacteristics of active verbs, which fall into two inflec-tional categories(non-causativeandcausative), are as follows:(1) Non-causatives are inflected(a)by suffixation, as exhibitedin the use of the semelfactive, habitual, and conditional sets of
endings, or (b) by juxtaposition, as exhibited in periphrastic constructions involving the auxiliary verbs. (2) Causatives are normally inflected only by juxtaposition. (3) Both types of verbs are
inflected for object by means of the alienable pronominal prefixes.
Static verbs exhibit the following inflectional traits: (1) Their
non-inchoative forms are constructed by means of the inalienable
pronominal prefixes which function on the grammatical level as
objects, on the interpretive level as subjects. (2) Their inchoative
forms are constructed by the use of certain active verb inflectional elements but at the same time retain the inalienable pronominal prefixes in the function just described.",[39]

"A word, phrase, or clause serving in oneof these functions is known as a syntactic element of a larger
clause or of a sentence.
Syntactic elements arebuiltupintoclauseswhichmaybedivided into two principal types: main and subordinate. The lat.
ter are further subdivided into four functional types: dependent,
complementary, relative, and adverbial.
The various types of clauses are built up into three main types
of sentences: simple, compound, and complex. Simple sentences
differ from main clauses only in that they stand alone. Compound
sentences are rare but contain two or more main clauses. Complex sentences, on the other hand, are very common and consist
of a main clause and one or more of the various types of subordinate clauses.
This brief summary is intended to elucidate the terminology
used in the immediately following sections (7.3 to 7.5) in which is |
presented a more detailed discussion of syntax in reverse order,
viz., sentences, clauses, and syntactic elements. The syntactic
uses of the various word-classes are discussed in section 10.

may contain any one of the other syntactic elements or any combination of these. Examples:

"He himself always spoke veryrapidly as if he might be in danger of forgetting the words if he did
not utter them as fast as possible. But in contrast to his own manner of speaking he says that ‘“‘the old people sitting around the fire
telling stories always talked slow, slow.’’ In addition he oftencommented on the fact that the old people “‘spoke more plain.”
In spite of the obvious deficiencies in Youchigant’s command of
the language, I think it is safe to say that I obtained as much linguistic information from him as it is possible to obtain. While it
cannot be denied that there are certain lacunae in this material,
most of these are to be interpreted as lacunae in his knowledge of
the language. Although the grammatical analysis of a dying language presents for this reason many problems and difficulties, I
have made every attempt to present the grammar of Tunica in thesame way that I would present that of a living language.
Most of the illustrative material quoted in the chapters on
morphology and syntax is taken from my book Tunica Tezts.? The
source is given in parentheses immediately after the Tunica exam-ple.",[10]

4.64TRANSITIVESTransitives are normally inflected for pronominal object as well
as for pronominal subject. Inflection for pronominal subject isthe same as for intransitives while inflection for pronominal obJect is accomplished by the use of the alienable pronominal prefixes or the reciprocal prefix (4.56). It should be noted that a
number of stems may be used as either transitives or intransitives
depending on whether they occur with or without expressed proNominal object, e.g.,
?uya nakate’ni.(44:d) she spoke to him; ya'nakate'nt.she spoke

"Nouns in the indeterminative category or in the definitive case
of the determinative category are used in the following ways:

"On the other hand, it is equally possible to place both modifiers
either before or after the predicative word, e.g.,
(1s) to’mahkdku,Puhke’ni.(pm) ha’tikdn, (pM) ta’wist ha’ytht, (pw) hopi’-(14a:k)The alligator again came out on thewater, it 1s said.(pw) ?a’'k?uwa'ni, (pM) ta'rku ki’étin, (pm) la’hontohku.
He went into the woods early, it is said.(118:c)Rule 9.
All non-locative predicate modifiers are permitted
considerable freedom as to placement. They may precede or fol-low the independent subject, the independent object, the predicative word, or a locative predicate modifier. They may stand at
the beginning of the clause (after the sentence connective) or theymay stand at the end of the clause, e.g.,

(pm) hihé (pw) ?u'k?anta'ni, (pm) ha’tikdn.",[99]
"Other special points regarding the use of the independent personal pronouns follow:
(1) Theyare used as substitutes only for animatenounsandmust agree with them in gender and number (see 8.22).
(2) Since all verbs contain pronominal referentials it is not
necessary to employ an independent personal pronoun as independent subject or object unless there is a shift in the animate
referred to. In other words, once the characters are established
in the context by means of nominal referees, the independent personal pronouns are used in cases like the following:
ka’na la’pu yu'k?éné, la’pu sa’k?ik?ahed, 2uni’kate’ni.
tthé, ?u'win, pa’kahk?uta'ni. ta’hein, ya'nakate'ni.hinya'?u'win,pa'kahk?u't?una’ni. (4a:d) “If I cook something good, you

very rarely, immediately follows) the predicative word. Phrasing
normally separates the two elements, e.g.,

7.62ORDEROFCLAUSESThe following rules and tendencies of clause order should be
noted:Rule 1. Main clauses always take sentence-final position.
Apparent exceptions in the case of complementary clauses (rule 3
below) and adverbial clauses (rule 5 below) are occasioned by the
fact that such clauses complement or modify the predicative word
of the main clause. Either of these two types of clauses is theretore to be construed as a clause within a clause. The sentencefinal position of the main clause is illustrated in the following
example:
(pwipc-l) ?uso'liyu’kawithé, (pc: pc-2) ?usu’éiwan (Pw: Dc-2)
ya'wihé, (1s:pc-3) ri’hkuya’hon (pw:pc-3) wa'hkawthé
(pm: pco-4) hih (pw: pc-4) po’wihé, (Is: Mc) ya’?an, (Pw: MC)
ka'l?ura’ni. (20:a) When he arrived and crept up on him,when he was about to shoot him, when a limb cracked,
when he looked there, a deer was standing, it is said. Or,
very freely: He crept up on it, got ta (it) and was about
to shoot it when a limb cracked; looking (in that direction
he saw) a deer.",[100]
"Similar examples are the following:
?4’man, tt'ri§ na’ ?and, ma’?an, 2a’hkis na’ 2k? thé, la'puhé, ?uni’kate'nt. (4a:g) “If I lie to the front and if you lie to the

10.13THEINTERROGATIVE-INDEFINITEPRONOUNSThe interrogative-indefinite pronouns are ka’ku “who, someone, anyone” and ka’nahku “what, something, anything.”’ The
former is a masculine singular but the latter is genderless and
numberless. They are used as substitutes for nouns with the following restrictions: (1) They do not occur in the locative case,
noun use no. 6, and (2) ka’nahku does not occur as independent
subject, noun use no. 2. Note also that when ka’nahku occurs as
independent object, the verb never takes an objective pronominal referential (see third example below). Examples:
ka’nahkiin.(11a:e) What is it?(< ka’nahku + -n, interrog.postf.; predicative word)ka’k sihpe Pun.(33:a) Someone has seen me.subj.)(ka’ku; indep.ka'na ra'p?dné (9:4) if I kill something (ka’na(hku) ; indep. obj.)

quantifiers such as ho’tu “all, everything’; na’mu “many, much”;

2a’mari “enough.” ! These words are used as follows:

occur in the texts, but in non-text examples it is used with adjectives and with non-inchoative static verb forms, e.g.,

available material. Some of these are probably archaic and most
of them are of doubtful meaning.
(31) -we, prob. an archaic exhortative postf., occurring in two
identical examples, viz., sa’kunawé (224:f, 22B:f) which the informant translated as ‘‘Let’s eat!” If the first person dual is implied it should be sa’k?inawé and the form as dictated is apparentlyincorrect. In corroboration of this we find that Gatschet wrote the
form as sa’kinawe ! and, since he did not record glottal stops, we
may read his form as sa’k?inawe < sa'k?ina “we eat’? + -we.(82) -yo, of no certain meaning, occurring only in the word
?7’mayo (4A:ar, 4B:ap, 4B:aq, 4B:ar) with the meaning “‘It is I”
(< ?¢’ma, 1s pron., + -yo).
(33) -tan, some kind of subordinating postf. In the only two
instances of its occurrence it is translated once as ‘‘after’’ and once
as “while,” e.g., 2a’m?uhkitan (4a:p) “after he had gone” (< ?a’m?uhki “he had gone” + -tan); hi’htin, ?u'natan (4a:bd) “‘while
he lived there” (?u'natan < ?u’na “he lived” + -tan).
(84) An element -at (or possibly -hat, though apparently unrelated to no. 21) is used once with a verb form, viz., po’nihcét (30)
“when I looked” (< po’ni “I looked” + -héi + -at or -hat). It is
assumed that -hci may be the unapocopated form of -hé (no. 4
above) but it has not been possible to establish a meaning for -at
or -hat; note that po’nihé (< po’ni + -hé) would mean ‘“‘when I
looked.”
(35)In one case an element -?aha is used in a context whichdoes not require a negative (see no. 18). In this case it has seemed
appropriateto rendertheelementas‘“‘indeed,”’viz.,te’hé?ehé,?o’wand (13:y) “It is she, indeed, (that) I want.” (ti’héehe < ta’hi, 3FS8 pron., + -?aha). Though the same form could mean “‘it is
not she,” such a rendition would not fit the context.
9.37ORDEROF THEPOSTFIXESIn certain cases more than one postfix is attached to the same
word and in this event their order is fixed. Note the following
rules. The references are to 9.32, 9.33 and 9.34:
Rule 1. The quotative postfix -a’ni (no. 6) follows any other
postfix which is used with the same word, e.g.,
lu'piwik?ahéa'nt.

discussed in the next section.
4.63LIMITEDINTRANSITIVESORPERSONIFICATIVESThere are two types of limited intransitives which may be referred to as masculine and feminine personificatives, respectively.

limited subjective inflection, personificatives resemble imper-sonals.",[55]

material obtained from Youchigant has contributed much toward making pos-sible a fuller and more adequate analysis of the language.

"74HAASTUNICAtually synonymous stems are sometimes linked in order to make
more vivid the picture that is being portrayed, e.g., t’Slindhé,ta’yoronéa'hak ?uhk?o'nise’man, na'mu ri'kin sthko'héusa’kukate'ni
(4B:k) ‘The Stone Witch was devouring and eating too many of
the Tunica chief’s people” wherein sihko’héusa’kukate'ni is based
on ko’héu “to devour” + sa’ku “‘to eat.”
5.38StaticVersSTEMs5.381 In one instance it has been found that the thematic suffix
-hapa- (5.215) is added to an inchoativized static verb form (4.73),
viz.,
?uya' Sep?ake'ni.
(4B:br) he was already angry < had already got angry; based on -ya’sepa- < -ya’s& to be angry
+ -hapa-On the basis of this single example it is not possible to determine
whether such formations are legitimate or not. If they are, it
seems likely that they would require the verb to be of inchoative
form since -hapa- must be followed by an inflectional element.
5.32 What remains to be said about the formation of static
verb stems is concerned with petrified or non-productive formatives. We find that there are a few static verb stems beginning in
two consonants and that in most cases the first of these is § In
addition, a few of such stems appear to be related to certain active
verb stems, and, on the strength of this observation, it is assumed
that we have here an archaic prefix *-§(7)- which may at one time
have served the function of deriving static verb stems from active
verb stems. Note the following cases:
-sni'yu- to be lonesome; possibly related to the act. verb stemni'yu intr. to think
-§pi'tu- to get lost; possibly related to pz’tu trsimp. to get lost-Sru’ka to be afraid, scared, frightened;
ru’ka..c. tr. to frighten, scarepossibly related toFor other stems beginning in § plus a consonantwith active verb stems have been found.no connectionsThe prefix is set up as*.§(7)- rather than as *-§- because of such stems as -3?e’pa ‘“‘to behappy” which may be derived from *-%- + *-?a’pa, the trace of
the 7 being preserved in the presumably assimilated vowel e. Note
also -§?e’lama ‘“‘to be helpless” which may be <*-&i- + *-?a’lama.

forms a nexus known as a postpositional phrase; see illustrations
In 7.56 and 10.3.
7.593 Still another type of nexus is found in the case of a
noun functioning as possessor followed by the noun which is possessed. A possessive nexus serves in any of the syntactical functions that a noun may, e.g.,

gender, and number (4.22) but do not have special forms distinguished as to the indeterminative and determinative categories as
nouns do. They are used as substitutes for nouns and hence,
except for the fact that they do not occur in the locative case
(noun use no. 6), they may be used in all the ways that nouns are

"Another difference between the two types ofstems is found in the fact that whereas active verb stems must begin in one but only one consonant, static verb stems may begin in
a vowel, a single consonant, or two consonants.
Although static verb stems are limited in number (there being
in all not more than thirty of them in the available material), the60HAASTUNICAtypes of ideas they express deserve attention and may be briefly
summarized as follows:(1) an emotional state, e.g., -ya’ri ‘‘to be ashamed”’; -ya’8i “‘to
be angry”; -wa’na ‘“‘to want, wish, be willing’’; -sru’ka “‘to be
afraid, scared, frightened”’; -5?e’pa “‘to be happy, glad, pleased”’;
-he’kani “‘to be excited, distraught.”
(2) a physical state, e.g., -ya’hpa “‘to be hungry”; -p.’htuni
“to be intoxicated’’; -si’pi “‘to be cold, chilly (of an animate
only)’’; -sz’hu “to be dry, thirsty” ; -re’kani “‘to be tipsy, partiallyintoxicated”’; -3to’hku “‘to be tired, fatigued, lazy’’; -ha’yz ‘‘to be
old.”
(3) a mental state, e.g., -e’rusa “‘to know”’; -Spi'tu- (inchoative
only; 4.73) ‘“‘to forget.”
(4) possession, e.g., -e’hiini ‘‘to own, possess”’; -la’ka “‘to have’’;
-hk?a’ra “to have’’; -hk?a‘ha (suppletive neg. of -hk?a’ra) ‘“‘not to
have.”
(5) andoneunclassifiedstem-hk?a’?akimeaning‘‘to be re-maining, left, left over.”
It will be noted at once that a number of the stems which express
an emotional or a physical state resemble adjectives on the semantic level. On the inflectional level, however, they are quite distinct
from adjectives. Whereas static verb stems, as mentioned above,
must be inflected by means of the inalienable pronominal prefixes,
adjectives are never permitted to undergo this or any other type
of inflection (3.3). Note the following contrasting pair of examples:
ta’hct te’'yast. She is angry. (é’héi, indep. pers. pron., “she”;
tiya’ st “she is angry” < ti-, 3¥Fs inal. pref., + -ya’81, static
verb stem, ‘‘to be angry’’)
thé lap.
She is good.
(ti’hdéi “she”; la’pu, adjective,
“good’’)4.724.721NON-INCHOATIVEFORMSThe non-inchoative forms of static verbs consist of theinalienable pronominal prefixes (4.21) plus the given stem.

rendered as subjects in English translations (as above).
4.722 The stem -e’rusa “to know”’ forms its dual in an irregular manner. Unlike other static verb stems it has a special dual
stem -e’runasa formed from -e’rusa by the insertion of a dual infix
-na- between its second vowel and the following consonant. The
dual stem is used for the 1p-p, 2mp-P, 2FD-P, 3MD, and 3FD-P formsof its paradigm and the infix -n- belonging to the inalienable prefixes is then omitted, e.g., 2e’runasd ‘“‘we know” (< %%-, in place of
9j-n-, 1p-P pref., + -e’runasa). The simple stem -e’rusa, on the
other hand, is used for all of the singular forms and for the 3mp
form, e.g., ?0’rusa “he knows” (< ?u-, 3ms pref., + -e’rusa);
se'‘rusa ‘they know” (< si-, 3mp pref., + -e’rusa).
4.73INCHOATIVEFORMS4.731
Most static verbs may also have special inchoative
forms which contain not only an inalienable prefix but also a 3Frs
subjective element, i.e., either a 3Fs inflectional ending (normally
attached to active verb stems, 4.52) or the 3rs form of the auxiliary verb ?u’hki (4.421). The use of one of these 3rs forms adds an
inchoative significance to the static verb complex, e.g.,
?uya'hpatihé(421)whenhegothungry< ?u-,3ms_pref.,+ -yavhpa to be hungry + -t, 3Frs smlf. endg., + -hé,
subord. postf.
Puya’ Seke’ni. (4B:r) he got angry < ?u-.+ -ya’& to be angry
+ ?a’ki, 3Fs smlf. of 2u’hki, + -a’nt, quot. postf.
sinsto’hk?oke'nt.
(4a:ay) They got tired < si-n-, 3Fp-P pref.,
+ -sto’hku to be tired + ?a’ki + -a'ni4.732 Inasmuch as the inchoative forms of static verbs contain
an element which must be construed as the grammatical subject,
we have in this fact justification for our assumption that the inalienable pronominal prefixes function as grammatical objects
when used with static verbs (4.721). Attention should also be
called to the fact that the inchoative forms of static verbs are conStructed in a manner comparable to the construction of transimPersonal active verbs (4.66). The difference between the two types of verbs lies in the fact that whereas transimpersonal verbs can-hot be used without an expressed 3rs subject, most inchoativeStatic verb forms have
Which no expressedcorresponding non-inchoative forms ingrammaticalsubject is required.two static verb stems, -&ni’yu- “to get lonesome”However,and -Spi’tu- ‘toforget,” form exceptions to this rule. Although they may occur

"While there are a fewother Indians who know some isolated words and phrases of Tunica, none of them is familiar enough with the language to converse with Youchigant. In fact Youchigant has had no occasion
to converse in Tunica since the death of his mother in 1915, and,
even before her death, he preferred to speak French to her al-though she always spoke Tunica to him.
Tunica was probably in a more or less decadent state even two
or three generations ago. The reasons for this are obvious. Nearthe end of the nineteenth century the Indian village near Marksville was inhabited by remnants of at least three rapidly dying
tribes: Tunica, Ofo,? and Avoyelles.? To add to the linguistic confusion there were Biloxi? and Choctaw Indians living nearby and
the various groups frequently danced and played ball together.
Since the language of each of these tribes (except the Choctaw)was known to only a few individuals, intertribal communication
was possible only through the medium of the Mobilian jargon °

"VERBSActive verbs may be used in finite or infinitive forms. Finite
forms are always inflected for a subjective pronominal referential (4.52 and 4.54) and are always used as predicative words.
