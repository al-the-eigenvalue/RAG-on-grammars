"122type of causative derivation is a very productive means of increasing transitivity.
Besides this, a causative derivate can heighten the status of a peripheral argument
without adding a new argument. For example, the intransitive verb ‘walk around’
<smb.: N, smth.: L> becomes transitive under causativization, cf.:
(27) a. gymmy
I+NOMty-kamlily-krara-k.1sg.S-walk.around-1sg.Shouse-LOCI walked around the house. [a=b]b. gym-nan
I-ERGty-n.kamlil.avy-nrara-Na.1sg.A-walk.around-3sg.Phouse-NOM+SGIn (27b) the causative verb re-interprets the initial peripheral argument ‘house’
as the Absolutive. Initial S-argument receives an iconic agentive marking in the
ergative case.
3.1.6. Dative agreement
Transitive verbs usually agree with A- and P-arguments. However a personal
recipient/addressee of a three-place verb can “usurp” control over the P-marker:
(28)aktykamy-jyl-gytjava-l@-uwwi ...impossible1sg.A+OPT-give-2sg.Puse-ATR-NOM+PLI can't give you (my) clothes [=those I'm using]. {RC: Later my husband will come, and
I will give you the clothes on the sledge.} [7:34]The P-argument javal@uwwi ‘used’ preserves its nominative marking, however
the verb agrees with the recipient ‘to you’. In such clauses the properties of a Pargument are distributed between the patient (case) and recipient (agreement).
3.2. Word order
Alutor has free word order. It is often difficult to claim which order is basic.
Discontinuous constituents are also possible.
3.2.1. Word order in a predicate-argument structure
In verbal clauses the most frequent word order structures are SVO and VSO:
(29) a. tita·qaqutkinJnJaqu-nakmaN.ki·@anaone.dayQutkinnaqu-ERG+SGsomewhere123ga-la@u-linynny-@yn.","[122, 123, 124]"
"ADJ-thick-ADJ+3sgice-NOM+SGWell, the layer of ice (was) thick {RC: but it began to break like paper.} [16:17]The word order in clauses with nominal predicates also varies.
(31) a. gytka-wasgileg-NOM+PLnownaqam

(It was) because (I) was sorry for the children (who) came out to meet me [=It was
because the meeting children (were) poor]. [10:31]In (31a) the word order is SV, while in (31b) VS.
3.2.2. Word order in noun phrases
A modifier can precede as well as follow the NP head.",[124]
"I+NOMyou-DATADJ-most=strong-1sg... I am the strongest of you all ... [22:23]99It is remarkable that the Alutor word is in the singular, which means that there is only one
object for each possible subject of the action.",[87]
"Words that do not acquire stress according to these rules are considered
unaccentuated, cf. &najylyn ‘they gave him/her/it’, &tyjylyn ‘I gave him/her/it’ (the
accentuated root {jyl}), &tyHalJulJun ‘I rocked him/her to sleep’ (the unaccentuated
root {HalJulJu}) (some exceptions were mentioned in 1.2.2, group 4b).
1.3.4.3. Syllable Addition
It appears that the rhythmic structure of the language does not permit stress to fall on
the last syllable of a word, but strings with the last stressed syllable may appear at
intermediate stages of derivation (see rules I and II). In order to improve the rhythmic
structure a supplementary syllable is added.
The syllable addition rules run as follows:
if the stress falls on the last (closed) syllable of a word, a supplementary
syllable of the |CV| type is added by means of geminating the last consonant and
35In Alutor there are neither stressed disyllabics with the second light syllable nor stressed
disyllabics with the first light and the second open syllable.
36
Otherwise, i.e. if the first syllable is light, the word does not acquire any stress.",[25]
"2.3.1.3. Local semantic functions
A noun phrase can also express different types of location (location with respect to
the object expressed by a base noun). These functions are expressed either by a
derivative suffix (in the case there is a contact between the objects or at least it is
implied) or by an adposition governing the locative noun phrase (in the case there is
no obvious contact between the objects), for details see [Muravyova 1994].
In order to express functions of the first type, a nominal derivative with a
locative suffix is used. In general, such derivatives have complete paradigms
including the nominative, but the most frequent forms are cases with locative
functions, such as the locative, the dative (with an allative function), the lative and the
prolative.
The following local functions are expressed by means of suffixes:
SUPER ‘surface of an object’, the marker -lq (with the variant -lJq), for
instance: Najy-lJqy-N ‘(climb) the mountain’ [8:38], gytgy-lq-epyN ‘(migrate) along
the surface of the lake’ [16:7], ujatiki-lJqy-k ‘(load smth.) on the sledge’ [22:66],
vylJusa-lJqy-k ‘(put smth.) on a dish’ [29:27];
IN ‘inner part of an object’, the marker -giN, for instance: ulJgyv-giN-ki ‘in the
grave’ [5:10], ulJgyv-giN-gypyN ‘(shout) from the grave’ [7:59], syge-giN-ki ‘(hide) in
the sands’ [18:18], tygar-giN-kyN ‘(go) inside the store-hole’ [21:73];
INTER ‘place among objects’, the marker -swyn/-lwyn, for instance: tumykkalwyny-k ‘(to talk about smth.) in the presence of other people’ [22:68], ra.mky-swyni ‘(to visit) all the houses’ [28:2], Ne-swyny-k ‘(to live) among the mountains’ [32:4];101APUD ‘place near an object’, the marker -teny, for instance: ra-teny-k ‘(to
dance) by the neighbouring house’ [39:4], inmy-teny-k ‘(to build a village) near the
cliff’ [23:3], ynykka-teny-k ‘(to put smth.) near himself’ [29:21].
If there is no obvious contact between the two objects, adpositions 108
expressing various local functions are used (they govern the locative case form), cf.
ymiNqal tynupy-k ‘behind a hill’, ujatiki-k gytulNyNqal ‘at the side of a sledge’,
rymetyNqal tynupy-k ‘far behind a hill’, inmy-k telyNqal ‘on the other side of a rock’,
tilirra-k semyk ‘near Tilirran {the village Tilichiki}’.
2.3.2. Predicative forms
The predicative form of a noun is marked for person and number of its S-actant. To
express the 1st and the 2nd person the person-number suffixes identical with those of
an adjective (original or deverbal) are added. The 3rd person is identical with the
nominative singular, dual and plural respectively. The person-number forms are given
in Table 19.

2-jgyt-turi-turu3= NOM+SG= NOM+DU=NOM+PLThe predicative is used when a noun is a predicate (for present situations).

marked differently:

I+NOMalva.l@-igymqaj.unJunJu-jgym ...not-1sglittle.boy-1sgI'm not a little baby ... [30:32]108These auxiliary words can be used both prepositionally and postpositionally (though the
latter is more common). We refer to them as adpositions and use this term in the Dictionary
(adpostions are marked with the abbreviation adp). Some Alutor adpositions consist of two parts:
the main part (the root) and the suffix with a local function, cf. tely.Nqal ‘on that side of’, with the
root {tely} ‘there, that’ and the suffix {-Nqal} meaning ‘the side of’.

Alutor shows a clear morphological opposition between two classes of adjectives:
q u a l i t a t i v e adjectives and r e l a t i v e adjectives. These classes of adjectives
have different markers and belong to different derivation types. Qualitative adjectives
appear as an original lexical group, while relative adjectives are derived from other
parts of speech (mostly nouns).
From a syntactic point of view adjectives are used either a u t o n o m o u s l y
(i.e. as separate words, usually attributes or predicates), or in i n c o r p o r a t i o n . An
adjective can be used attributively only when its head noun is marked for the
nominative (see 2.2.4). In this case an attribute agrees in p e r s o n and n u m b e r
with its head noun. If an adjective is used predicatively, it also agrees in person and
number with its S-actant, so the forms used in both situations are identical. In the case
its head noun is not a nominative case form, an adjective is usually incorporated (for
details see 2.2.4).
We will first consider qualitative and relative adjectives used autonomously,
and then discuss adjective incorporation.
2.2.1. Qualitative adjectives
Qualitative adjectives belong to the class of original predicates denoting various kinds
of qualities and properties. They have at least one actant, that is an S-actant (the
subject of a quality or property).
Qualitative adjectives are marked with the circumfix n-...-qin(a) (further
shortened to n-...-qin), the same as that used with verbal adjectives (see 2.1.2). The
prefixal part n- appears in all qualitative adjectives, so it marks the part of speech,
while the suffixal part -qin(a) is used only with the 3rd person S-actant, so it
expresses both the part of speech and the person(-number) agreement. With the 1st or
2nd person the standard monopersonal markers are used (see Table 11 above). A
sample of person-number adjective forms is given in Table 12.",[84]
"114Cf. the English pronoun what used attributively in phrases like what book?.
Actually, there exists an interrogative pronoun derived from the root {taq} by means of
the suffix -in(a), that is the pronoun {taq.in(a)}. However, it is used only to denote the object of
certain verbs of speech such as ‘say, speak (about smth.)’ in an interrogative sentence, cf. taq.in
ynN.ina iv-la-t? ‘What did they say?’ [10:48]
115109CHAPTER 3. Syntax
In this chapter we shall briefly, without any ambitions to completeness, consider
some of the most important topics of clause structure.
3.0. Basic notions
In this study of Alutor syntax we do not use such t r a d i t i o n a l syntactic notions as
subject and object since, in our opinion, their common usage is not congruent with
the internal structure of Alutor and would merely lead to misunderstanding. In this
case it is more advisable to use more neutral notions based on a framework of core
arguments constituting the base of clause syntactic structure (for the grounds of the
opposition “core vs. peripheral arguments” see [Kibrik 1998]).
There is a restricted number of core arguments in a clause. If there is only one
core argument in a clause 116 , the clause (as well as its predicate) is i n t r a n s i t i v e .
This argument is called the S - a r g u m e n t (Sole) irrespective of its semantic role. If
there are two core arguments in a clause, the clause (as well as its predicate) is
t r a n s i t i v e . A transitive clause has an agent-like A - a r g u m e n t (Agentive) and a
patient-like P- a r g u m e n t (Patientive).
In our case, this terminology is preferable because it does not ascribe a
particular syntactic pattern to Alutor clause structure, keeping this fundamental
question open for further investigation, as there is not yet enough data to resolve this
problem.
3.1. Transitivity increase and decrease
Alutor has a strict distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs. T r a n s i t i v e
verbs have two core arguments: an A-argument and a P-argument. The A-argument is
116In Alutor there are many ambient verbs with a zero S-argument indicating ‘environment
of the event’:

(ii) imjaq
Hitu-ru@-i.
alreadygoose-fly.in-3sg.SGeese have already flown in.","[109, 110]"
"108Besides demonstrative adjectives, there are also demonstrative adverbs derived
from the same roots: wutku ‘here’, wutkepyN ‘from here’, Nanyk ‘there’, igynNinak
‘that is why’ and others. In order to express great distance from the speaker and the
hearer the iconic vowel lengthening is used (see 1.3.8.1), for instance, instead of
Nanyk ‘there’ the form NOnyk ‘far over there’ is often used.
2.4.4. Interrogative pronouns
The following two interrogative nouns are used in Alutor: {taq} ‘what’ ( tinga ‘what,
NOM+SG’) and {mik} ‘who’ (migga ‘who, NOM+SG’). They are used very much
like nouns. The pronoun ‘what’ is declined as a word of the 1st declension, and the
pronoun ‘who’ − as a word of the 2nd declension. The pronoun ‘what’ is used not
only in the singular, but also in the plural (cf. taq-uwwi ‘what, NOM+PL’ [17:13]).
Being used predicatively, these pronouns agree with their S-actant (which can
be omitted) in person and number:
(84)mik-igyt?
who-2sg
Who are you? [5:12]When the pronoun {taq} ‘what’ is used attributively in the underlying structure,
it is obligatorily incorporated; in this case it means ‘what; what kind of’ 114 . Compare:
(85)taq=Nav.@an-igyt?
what=wife-2sg
(It's not important) whose wife you are. [13:10]A pronoun similar to the adjectival form is found only for the pronoun ‘who’ −
it is the possessive pronoun mik.in(a)- ‘whose’ 115 . It is used like any other
possessive adjective marked with -in(a) and it may be substantivized like any other
pronominal adjective.","[108, 109]"

the agreement of the predicate.
The predicative is also used as an apposition for another noun or pronoun (the
pronoun itself may be absent).
(81)yjOwytina-n.tymNi.v-la-tyklong.time.agoNan-ynnul-egym ...1sg.P-lose-PLUR-2nsg.Athere-the.same-1sgLong, long ago you lost me. That's me ... [6:35]The predicative is also used when addressing somebody:

The adjectival form of a noun is actually the result of a derivational process, when a
noun becomes an adjective. We distinguish between relative (REL), possessive
(POSS), habitive (HABIT) and caritive (CARIT) adjectives, see 2.2.2. From a
syntactic point of view an adjectival is used in the role of the genitive, sometimes the
ablative, which occur in other languages with case systems.
2.3.4. Noun incorporation
A noun in the nominal can by incorporated by a verb or other noun. Thus, we have
v e r b a l composites, with a verb as the head, and n o m i n a l composites, with a
noun as the head, (for details see 3.1.4). An adjectival (= denominal adjective) can
also be incorporated (see 2.2.4 above). Incorporated nouns have no category markers;
incorporated denominal adjectives may preserve their adjectivizers -kin and -in,
which are referred to as derivational affixes.
Nouns are easily incorporated when they have no modifiers in the underlying
syntactic structure, and the speaker refers to the corresponding objects as background103information (for details see 3.1.4).
Nouns are incorporated by other nouns when they are used attributively in the
underlying structure and denote non-specific objects, for instance: tanNy=@irra-n
‘the enemy party’ [21:10], Hasu=nym.jyr@y-n ‘a village of pink salmon’ [3:21],
viHe=rara-Na ‘a grass house’ [6:16], wir=imyt ‘the load of alder bark’ [7:8]. Not all
linguists consider this type of compounding incorporation, but it is obviously a highly
productive type of compounding.","[102, 103, 104]"

Usually there is a distinction between existential, taxonomic, characterizing, and
identificational nominal clauses. In Alutor existential clauses are opposed to all other
types of nominal clauses.
3.3.1. Status of existential clauses
Alutor existential clauses are not in the strict sense nominal. They have the verb it‘be, be found’ governing the nominative S-argument.
(36) a. to
andymqa-ninjil@alNy.tumgy-nEmqa-POSS.SG+3sgmale.cousin-NOM+SGg-ity-lqiv-lin...

...And Emqa had a male cousin ... [21:3]b. wajyn

below), there are grounds to consider existential clauses verbal.
3.3.2. Taxonomic clauses
Taxonomic clauses indicating the membership of a nominal argument in a class of
objects have two main patterns. T h e f i r s t , most natural pattern is a combination of
two adjacent NPs, one of them being the S-argument, and the other the predicate:
(37) a. qutawwyjNy-nin
[Qutawweyngen-POSS.SG+3sgqetakalNy-nHaqaniNvitbrother-NOM+SGAqaningvit+NOM+SG]126qajylJHinny-kin.
[Qayelinne-REL+3sg]
{LC: Once there lived an old man from Alut {the village Alutorka} called
Qutawweyngen and his wife Kemlingawet.} (And) Qutawweyngen's brother
Aqaningvit, (was) from Qayelinnen {the village Khayilino}. [30:2]b. tur.ginsinin.kin[your+3sgqetakalNy-none's.own+3sgHaqaniNvit.brother-NOM+SG][Aqaningvit+NOM+SG]Aqaningvit is your own brother. [30:16]In (37a) the order of NPs is SV, in (37b) it is inversed: VS. The nominal
argument can be expressed as a demonstrative/deictic pronoun wuttin ‘this’:
(38)wutt.inkysim=@ujpy-lNyn,wutt.inlyla=@ujpy-lNyn,[[this+3sg][kidney=stick-NOM+SG]][[this+3sg][eye=stick-NOM+SG]]wutt.inpunta=@ujpy-lNyn.[[this+3sg][liver=stick-NOM+SG]]{LC: She went out for a stick for roasting:} This is a stick for the kidney. This is a stick
for the eyes. This is a stick for the liver. [14:13]The head of a predicate NP is marked with the predicative form of a noun (see
2.3.2), namely the overt personal markers controlled by 1st/2nd person S-arguments:
(39)tita-kin-egymgymmy(N)gy.nin-egymNav.akk-egym.when-REL-1sgI+NOMyour+1sgdaughter-1sgOnce I was your daughter. [6:33]In the predicate NP titakin-egym gy.nin-egym Navakk-egym ‘your once upon
a time daughter’ its head Navakk-egym, as well as modifiers agree in person-number
with the S-argument.
T h e s e c o n d pattern uses the verb it- that has in this context the meaning
‘be, serve as’ <smb.: N, as smb.: Eq>. This verb is compatible with the values of all
verbal categories in accordance with the semantics of the clause. In the predicate
position the noun is marked with the equative:
(40) a. jaqqy
wellynnua-lJylJa-ki-nun-it-qin.(s)he+NOMA-eye-CARIT-EQUATADJ`-be-ADJ`+3sgActually she was blind. [35:10]127b. y.ninny

POT-be-LQIV+PF{LC: If you step over me along the waist,} you will become a shaman. [24:12]In (40a) the predicate position is occupied by a substantivized caritive adjective,
in (40b) by a substantivized participle, and in (40c) by a noun 126 .
3.3.3. Characterizing clauses
Characterizing clauses add individual properties to the noun's referent. In the
predicate position the use of adjectives is the most natural.
(41) a. kali.l@y=kulta-lNyn
eared.seal=skin-NOM+SGny-Humry-qin,ally a-sim.av-kyl@in.","[126, 127, 128]"
"16special morpheme properties (also shown by the lowered script). Irrelevant segments
that separate X from A or B are marked in the context with “ ... ”. The symbol ∧
represents the null segment. The following symbols are used to indicate different
types of boundaries: “ # ” for a word boundary, “ = ” for a composite boundary, and “
- ” for an ordinary morpheme boundary. To describe the context, the logical
conjunctions “and” and “or” are sometimes used (they are underlined). All the rules
given below are illustrated by Alutor words. For each word we write its practical
transcription (see 1.3.12) and show its “phonological derivation”, that is a sequence
of several relevant intermediate stages coming from the underlying representation.
The derivation of a word is shown in round brackets and is marked with “ < ” (which
means “comes from”). The underlying representation is given in braces, the relevant
intermediate steps – without any brackets (but within the round brackets). Other
notations used in the rules are listed in Abbreviations and Symbols.
1.3.1. Reduplication
Reduplication in Alutor is used as a means of forming the nominative singular. The
information whether a noun employs reduplication to form the nominative singular is
shown in the Dictionary, the exact morphological structure of a word is defined by
morphological rules, so in this section we only describe the way a root copy is
formed. In Alutor a root copy always follows the corresponding root and consists of
only one syllable.
The root copy of a given reduplication is formed according to the following
rules (Rred marks a root to be reduplicated):
if a root to be reduplicated begins with a single consonant, the root copy
consists of the first three segments of the root, if it begins with a two-consonant
cluster or a vowel, the root copy consists of the first two segments of the root, i.e.
(1) 23 a. C1V1C2(…) ⇒ C1V1C2(…)=C1V1C2 / #_ and C1V1C2 ∈ Rred
b. C1C2... ⇒ C1C2...=C1C2 / #_ and C1C2 ∈ Rred
c. V1C1... ⇒ V1C1...=V1C1 / #_ and V1C1 ∈ Rred
Examples: kaltøkal (< {kaltired}) ‘beetle’, kãmNykum 24 (< kumN=kum
< {kumNred}) ‘voice’, HasãHas (< {Hasured}) ‘pink salmon’, wirãwir (< {wirured})
‘(kind of) salmon’, HÔlyHal (< HAly=HAl < {HAlyred}) ‘axe’, nykønyk (< nki=nk <
{nkired}) ‘night’, @anã@an (< anu=an < {anured}) ‘spring’, @ãjpy@uj (< ujp=uj <
{ujpred}) ‘prize’.
23Let us be reminded once again that the rules are given here in the order they should apply
to the underlying representation.
24
After the described operation, some other modifications take place (for instance, the
segments y and @ are epenthesized).","[16, 17]"
"RES-reach-LQIV-RES+3sg.Pgrass=house-NOM+SG...they arrived at a grass house. [6:16]In (22a) the first two incorporated compounds include the meaning of

Incorporation is a device that simplifies the syntactic structure of a clause. It121decreases the syntactic rank of constituents that are out of the scope of assertion and,
more generally, beyond the focus of attention 124 . If incorporation affects the
constituent that occupies a prestigious position in a clause, it opens the possibility of
raising the status of another constituent occupying a peripheral position in the initial
structure.
Along with this, it is possible to confirm the usage of incorporation for the
purpose of overcoming syntactic restrictions over syntactic structure. For example, l@- participles form reduced relative clauses whose nominative argument is
coreferential with the head NP. With respect to this restriction it is sometimes
necessary to free the nominative position, incorporating the P-argument of a transitive
verb:

sky’ (cf. HøHyk ‘in the sky’), @amkykO ‘very many’ (cf. @ômkyka ‘many’). Native
speakers do not perceive such long vowels as stressed ones.
1.3. Phonological Processes
Alutor exhibits a great variety of phonological processes22 . Here we find various
segmental changes − a l t e r n a t i o n s , as well as root copying − r e d u p l i c a t i o n s .
Among alternations there are replacements (including assimilations of different types,
lenitions and fortitions, coalescences, etc.), insertions and deletions, and also
metatheses. The most important phonological process in Alutor is that of creating the
right syllable and rhythmic structure: some phonological processes help to create the
right structure, while others take place only after the right structure has been created.
Most Alutor alternations are phonologically conditioned, but there are also many
alternations that are morphologically conditioned (the latter will be described in this
section too).
Alutor phonological processes are represented here in the form of rewriting
rules. The rules apply to the underlying representation of a word, that is a sequence of
underlying representations of morphemes constituting the word. Underlying
representations of morphemes are given in the Dictionary − see Part III. The result of
application is the surface representation, i.e. the phonetic transcription of a given
word. The rules are listed here in the order they should apply to the underlying
representation (the only exception is mentioned in 1.3.3.2).
The majority of rules given below describe various segment modifications; they
are numbered with Arabic numerals. There are also the stress assignment rules – they
are numbered with Roman numerals. Besides, there are some additional rules that do
not change the structure of words, but mark syllable boundaries and types of syllables
– they are numbered with capital letters.
Each rule is given in two variants: as an ordinary utterance and as a formal rule.
The notation we use for formal rules is X ⇒ Y / A_B, which means that a segment
(or a string of segments) X is replaced by a segment (or a string of segments) Y in the
context defined by A_B. The bar “ _ ” marks the position of the segment undergoing
the process. The context A and B may contain: symbols for consonants and vowels –
C and V, their phonological properties (shown by the lowered script), a morpheme
(M) the segment belongs to - a root (R) or an affix (this is marked with “ ∈ ”), some
22Here we follow the logical classification of phonological processes given in [Mel’иuk1996].","[15, 16]"
"13In unaccentuated words the vowel length contrast is hardly detectable. It should
be noted that unaccentuated words can be clearly distinguished only if the syllable
supposed to bear stress is an open one, cf. jônut [A] ‘today’ vs. &janut [a] ‘earlier’
(the symbol “ & ” indicates the absence of stress in a word), @inøri [I] ‘blanket’ vs.
&siriri [i] ‘sandpiper’. If such syllable is a closed one, it is more difficult to reveal the
absence of stress.
The position of stress in Alutor can be described in terms of syllable weight,
thus it is a quantity sensitive system. Two types of syllables are distinguished here:
l i g h t (mono-moraic) syllables and h e a v y (bi-moraic) syllables. Syllables of the
|Сy| type are light syllables, while the other types are all heavy.
The position of stress in accentuated words is determined by the following three
phonological constraints:
1) only a heavy syllable can bear stress; light syllables are always unstressed;
2) only the first or the second syllable can bear stress (but the second syllable is
preferable);
3) a word-final syllable cannot bear stress.
These constraints help us to describe all the possible rhythmic patterns. First of
all, a monosyllabic cannot bear stress, for its only syllable is the final one (but there
exist some unaccentuated monosyllablic auxiliary words − see below). In case of a
disyllabic accentuated word, the first syllable is stressed (it always appears to be a
heavy one), for instance, @ôkyk ‘son’, kíttil ‘forehead’, wôla ‘knife’ 20 . Polysyllabics
may have stress either on the first or the second syllable, cf. tølpyqal ‘shoulder’,
tírgytyr ‘meat’, nØgyqin ‘cool’, vitôtyk ‘work’, NyrôlNyn ‘knee’, vagílNyn ‘nail, claw’.
For details see the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.).
The class of unaccentuated words is represented by the following groups and
subgroups:
1) auxiliary words of different types, such as conjunctions, particles,
introductory words, and also some adverbs, cf. &qinaq ‘in order to’, &Horo ‘then’,
&matka ‘whether’, &kytvyl ‘not (prohibition)’, &gemat ‘maybe’, &agi ‘very’, &lygan
‘even’, &wasaq ‘sometimes’, &jaqi ‘later’;
2) some personal pronoun forms, such as:
a) the dative form with a light second syllable, cf. &gymykyN ‘to me’, &gynykyN
‘to you (sg)’, &@ynykyN ‘to him’, &murykyN ‘to us’, &turykyN ‘to you (pl)’, &@ytykyN
20Actually, when morphemes are combined into a word, at intermediate stages there may
appear a monosyllabic word with the only stressed syllable or a disyllabic word with the second
stressed syllable, but such intermediate representations are then extended by means of some
special rules (see 1.3.4.3), cf. Nôjjy (< Nôj < {Naj-∅}) ‘mountain’, Nyvã-jjy (< Nyvã-j < {Nvu-j})
‘(s)he/it began’, gyvô-kki (< gyvô-k < {gva-k}) ‘to stick’.","[13, 14]"
"1173.1.4. Incorporation
3.1.4.1. Syntax of incorporation
Syntactically incorporation can be described as a process resulting in some
constituent (t a r g e t o f i n c o r p o r a t i o n ) being deprived of its independent
syntactic position and being included in the stem of a word that immediately governs
it (g o a l o f i n c o r p o r a t i o n ). Incorporation does not obligatorily entail the
change of the argument structure, its functions are more general, therefore in this
section it is reasonable to consider this process from the point of view of its syntactic
potential in general.
The goal of incorporation can be the head of a VP (the verb) or of a NP (the
noun). As a result v e r b a l and n o m i n a l compounds 123 appear. Any modifiers of
VPs and NPs can be the targets of incorporation. They can belong to different word
classes.
The types of targets will be considered separately for VPs and NPs.
3.1.4.1.1. VP incorporation
Incorporation of the P-argument is most widespread. In this case the verb usually
becomes intransitive, while its initial A-argument becomes the S-argument:

"12No connection is found between syllable boundaries and morpheme boundaries.
At the same time, there is an obvious correlation between morpheme boundaries and
the position of epenthetic schwas: the schwa often plays the role of an
“intermorpheme segment”, cf. ní-mky-qin = n-y-mk-y-qin (< {n-mk-qin})
‘numerous’ (see 1.3.3.2).
The morphology of Alutor combines morphemes in such a way that an
underlying representation may be ill-formed. It may have illicit sound strings, such as
initial syllables without onsets, illicit consonant clusters, hiatus etc. Illicit strings
usually appear word-initially and word-finally, and also at morpheme boundaries 18 .
In order to obtain well-formed words, we must modify the underlying representation
by means of certain phonological rules, among them initial consonant deletion, glottal
stop epenthesis, schwa epenthesis, and hiatus vowel deletion (see 1.3.2 and 1.3.3).
1.2.2. Rhythmic Structure
According to their rhythmic structure, all Alutor words can be divided into two main
classes:
1) words having a phonetically prominent syllable − such words are called
a c c e n t u a t e d words;
2) words with no phonetically prominent syllables − such words are called
u n a c c e n t u a t e d words.
The class of accentuated words is the most numerous. Here we find the majority
of words belonging to the main parts of speech, and also a lot of auxiliary words.
The prominence of the stressed syllable is characterised by the increase of
pronouncing energy applied mainly to the rhyme of a syllable. This is manifested in a
number of ways. If a syllable is open and the nucleus is a short vowel (but not a
supershort y), the stress is expressed by the vowel lengthening, cf. qylôvul [A]
‘husband’. If a syllable is closed, the stress is expressed by the code strengthening,
that is the syllable-final consonant. The strengthening of a final consonant is clearly
perceptible in case of the |CyC| syllable type (native speakers say that in such
syllables the stress falls on the consonant, not on the vowel), cf. wítwyt [wíttywyt]
‘flower’ 19 . It is worthy of remark that syllables of the |Cy| type cannot bear stress,
because the vowel y cannot be lengthened.","[12, 13]"
"4studying this language group do 4 .
1.1.1.3. Long and Short e and o
Vowels e and o always appear as long segments in open stressed or open pre-stressed
syllables (that is in the first or the second syllable of an Alutor word − see 1.2), cf.
@ógyv [E] ‘yesterday’, jepílNyn [E] ‘hoof’, tùrak [O] ‘sink’, lJotítkyn [O] ‘top’.
Short e and o are found in several roots in closed stressed and closed prestressed syllables before or after q and H, cf. lóqtyk [e] (along with løqtyk) ‘come
back’, HoptílJHu [o] ‘all’, qùnpyN [o] (along with qãnpyN) ‘always’. In post-stressed
syllables, both open and closed, the vowels e and o are usually short, cf. @ísse [e]
‘aunt’, tytôtoratkyn [o] ‘I'll sink’. The latter situation can be treated as standard
vowel shortening in post-stressed position − see 1.3.7 5 . Short e and o are also found
in non-accentuated auxiliary words (see 1.2.2), cf. &gemat [e] ‘maybe’, &Horo [o]
‘then’ (non-accentuated words are marked with “ & ”).
Long E and O are also found in both open and closed syllables in so-called
“expressive” words, cf. tOk ‘(interjection) let us’ (for more details see 1.3.8.1).
Expressive lengthening of this kind can be found in many languages, but such long
vowels are not considered separate phonemes.
Thus, in Alutor long and short e and o occur in positions that complement each
other. That is why we find it possible to treat a long phone and its short counterpart as
4It is worth mentioning that native speakers of Alutor are not aware of the schwa as a
segment of their pronunciation, whether predictable or not. They think some Alutor words have
only consonants; at the same time, they can easily divide such words into syllables. For instance, a
word which sounds like pyNílly ‘news’ is treated as having three syllables – |p|Nl|l| (the symbol “ |
” indicates syllable boundaries), wítwyt ‘flower’ – as |wt|wt|, HítvyHyt ‘boat’ – as |Ht|v|Ht|. The
same is true for the Koryak language. E.A.Kreynovich [Kreynovich 1958] proposed for Koryak
words the non-vocalised representation (that is without y), but with marked syllable boundaries,
like |wt|wt|. Since the schwa is not part of such representation, the author does not consider it a
phoneme. In our opinion, such approach in neither adequate nor typologically justified, because
there arises a problem of dividing words into syllables – some words have unpredictable syllable
division. Nevertheless, E.A.Kreynovich was the first to pay attention to the crucial importance of
the notion of syllable for Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages. As we will see further, this notion is
absolutely necessary to create well-formed Alutor words.

From an historical point of view, the Alutor long E and O originated mostly from aj and
aw, or from yj and yw, and original e and o changed into i and u in most positions (they are
preserved only in closed syllables before or after q and H – see above), cf. the following related
words from Alutor and Koryak: Alutor jepílNyn [E] – Koryak jajpylNyn ‘hoof’, Alutor lJotítkyn
[O] – Koryak lJawtytkyn ‘the top of smth.’, Alutor @imNãlyk – Koryak @emNolyk ‘to miss (smb.)’,
but Alutor lóqtyk – Koryak leqtyk ‘to come back’, Alutor qùnpyN – Koryak qonpyN ‘always’
(these correspondences are discussed in detail in [Muravyova 1986a]).","[4, 5]"

deviations from this ideal semiotic pattern (the so called n o n - t r a n s p a r e n t

"Thus, we have examined pure and combined agreement markers. Their
distribution testifies to the fact that generally according to the cognitive logic of
Alutor the values of person are not independent from the values of mood and aspect.
On the contrary, they constitute a united semantic space where coordinates of various
person values are at different distances from each other and from various values of
mood and aspect. These spacal relationships of mutual proximity/remoteness have
their iconical (though not yet completely understood) expression in the overt form of
agreement markers.
2.1.1.2.3. Pure non-transparent agreement markers
Now let us consider pure n o n - t r a n s p a r e n t markers, presented in boldface in
Table 3. These markers are specific in the sense that it is difficult to ascribe to them a
single person-number value of an A/P-argument. It is easy to see that these markers
usually simultaneously take account of person-number values of both the A- and Parguments of transitive verbs. To be more precise, these markers are present with the
following combinations of person-number values of A- and P-arguments:
A
P
2nsg 3
3sg 3
3nsg 1/2/3
3sg 2
3sg/2 1nsg
3sg/2 1sgAgreement markers
-tki

nananaina-What is a motivation of this united expression of A/P-person-number values? In
our description the interpretation of these markers is based on the Deictic Hierarchy
mentioned above (see Figure 1). In this Hierarchy the arguments' person-number
values are ordered in accordance with the principle of m a r k e d n e s s r e v e r s a l
with respect to A/P-positions. Namely, the leftmost member of the Hierarchy51generally harmonizes with the A-role, and the rightmost member with the P-role.
Therefore the A-role is mostly unmarked for the ‘I’-argument, and the P-role for the
‘they’-argument, and vice versa, the A-role is generally marked for the ‘they’argument, and P-role for the ‘I’-argument. With respect to the intermediate positions
of the Deictic Hierarchy, markedness of the A-role increases in the Hierarchy from
left to right, whereas markedness of the P-role increases from right to left. The critical
point of this Hierarchy is the boundary between locutors and non-locutors. It is
normal for locutors to play the A-role 69 , whereas it is normal for non-locutors to play
the P-role. The following person-number combinations of A- and P-roles are
congruent with this tendency 70 :
A
P
I
— you sg/you nsg/him/them
we
— you sg/you nsg/him/them
you sg — him/them
It is easy to see that these combinations of deictic categories trigger the regular
(pure and combined) agreement markers. Deviations from the regular coding are
found in the context of the following person-number A- & P-combinations:
A
you sg —
you nsg —
he
—
they
—P
me/us
me/us /him/them
me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/them
me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/themIt is exactly these combinations that trigger non-transparent agreement markers
(see boldfaced markers in Table 3). However, the various combinations of deictic
values trigger different types of non-transparent markers, thus a more precise
formulation is needed. In general the choice of non-transparent coding depends on the
values of both arguments of the transitive verb, nevertheless the starting point for the
choice is the deictic properties of one of them. In the following cases it is the Aargument:
(a) the most deictically unnatural, i.e. the most marked A-argument (= ‘they’) needs the nontransparent marker (na-);69Moreover, locutor can play the P-role in case when the A-role is also occupied by locutor
outranking the former in the Deictic Hierarchy.

"1.3.3. Insertions
The following types of insertions occur in Alutor:
1) glottal stop insertion;
2) schwa insertion.
In order to formulate the schwa insertion rules we need two additional rules
which describe marking irrelevant morpheme boundaries and metathesis of a schwa
and a consonant.
1.3.3.1. Glottal Stop Insertion
The rules regulating glottal stop insertion run as follows:
a glottal stop is inserted word-initially immediately before a word-initial vowel,
and also before the initial vowel of a non-initial stem in a composite, i.e.
(5)a. ∧ ⇒ @ / #_V
b. ∧ ⇒ @ / =_V
Examples: @ôkyk (< {akk(a)}) ‘son’, @øt@yn (< {it@-n}) ‘fur coat’, @ypôNa (<
{ypa-Na}) ‘soup’; @alô@al (< ala=al < {alared}) ‘summer’, @ønmy@in (< @inm=@in <
inm=in < {inmred}) ‘gulp’, gymík@unJunJuN (< {gymyk=unJunJu-N}) ‘to my son’.
1.3.3.2. Schwa Insertion
In general, the schwa insertion rules seem to be rather simple and roughly run as
follows (some comments are given further):
a schwa breaks up a word-initial or word-final two-consonant cluster
(irrespective of whether there is a morpheme boundary between the two consonants21or not); a schwa breaks up a word-medial three-consonant cluster at a morpheme
boundary of any type, i.e.
(6)a. ∧ ⇒ y / #С1_(-)С2
b. ∧ ⇒ y / C1 _(-)С2#
c. ∧ ⇒ y / C1 _-C2C3 or C1 _=C2C3
d. ∧ ⇒ y / C1C2 _-C3 or C1C2 _=C3
Examples: typôNa 29 (< {tpa-Na}) ‘stone hammer’, nymôlqin (< {n-malqin(a)}) ‘good’, môqym (< {maqm(i)}) ‘arrow’, tôtyk (< {tat-k}) ‘bring’, jatítkyn (<
{jat-tkyn}) ‘(s)he is coming’, jagísvinin (< {jag=svi-ni-n}) ‘(s)he cut his/her foot’,
nørvyqin (< {n-irv-qin(a)}) ‘sharp’, @ønmy@in (< @inm=@in < inm=in < {inm=in})
‘gulp’; nôlgyHytvu (< {nalg=Hytv-w}) ‘canoe’.
Now let us comment on these rules. In the case where there is a one-consonant
morpheme in a three-consonant cluster, namely -С2-, the schwa is inserted at only one
of the boundaries, to the left or the right of this morpheme (therefore, the string
C1C2C3 does not change into C1yC2yC3). The boundary that does not count here is
referred to as “irrelevant” one. In the rules given above irrelevant boundaries are
considered null boundaries, cf. mytíntakravna (< {myt-n[-]takr-av-na}) ‘we took
them down’, where [-] is an irrelevant boundary.
The following one-consonant morphemes are found in Alutor which may
appear word-medially: 1) @- − the conjunctive prefix; 2) n- − the medial variant of the
causative marker; 3) -N − the suffixal part of some circumfixes − the potential marker,
the desiderative marker and also the derivative marker meaning ‘create (smth.)’.
When any of these morphemes appears as С2 in the string C1-С2-C3, the following
rules apply to reveal which of the boundaries should be treated as irrelevant:
if there is a non-final string of segments C1-С2-C3, the left boundary of the
medial consonant is considered irrelevant in case it is the prefix @-, and the right
boundary in case it is the prefix n-; in case the medial consonant is the suffix -N, the
left boundary is considered irrelevant, except when the suffix -N is followed by the
morph -ki (the marker of the infinitive, the locative or of a converb), in which case
the right boundary is considered irrelevant 30 , i.e.
29In the surface representation we attach an inserted y to the preceding morph, cf. jôty-k
*(< {jat-k}) ‘come’.
30
This additional rule can be interpreted in the following way. As the glottal stop is avoided
in syllable-final position (in this position y@ => A, see 1.3.6), and the fact that the morphs N and ki
appear close to each other can be explained historically (here ki comes from kyj, as the Kerek data
show [Skorik 1968]), the principle of irrelevancy can be formulated as follows: the irrelevant
boundary is a boundary between a root and a one-consonant affix, i.e. if possible they are not
broken up by a schwa.","[21, 22]"

Comment:The category m o o d is also obligatory. It has four values:
- i n d i c a t i v e (IND), does not have its own specific markers;
- o p t a t i v e (OPT), does not have its own specific markers 48 ;
- p o t e n t i a l (POT), circumfix marker ta-...(-N) 49 , framing the verb stem;
- c o n j u n c t i v e (CONJ), prefix marker @-/A- 50 .
Besides these, in Alutor there is also an impersonal form of the i m p e r a t i v e
(see 2.1.3).
Finally, the finite verb agrees 51 in person and number with its core arguments,
distinguishing three persons (1st/2nd/3rd person) and three numbers — s i n g u l a r
(sg), d u a l (du) and p l u r a l (pl) 52 . Intransitive verbs agree with their sole core
argument (S - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the nominative, and have, aspect and mood
being fixed, 9 person-number forms. The transitive verb agrees simultaneously with
the agentive argument (A - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the ergative as well as with the
patientive argument (P - a r g u m e n t 53 ) marked with the nominative, and has, aspect
48The mood value is coded cumulatively, together with person-number values, see below.
The suffix component of the circumfix can be covert, for example, in imperfective
potential. The potential marker coincides with desiderative marker (see 2.1.3 below).
50
The marker A- is a phonetic variant of the marker @- in specific positions (see 1.3.6).
51
In Alutor the person-number markers are combined with the unmarked usage of personal
pronouns in the core argument positions, so it is possible to interpret them as agreement markers.
52
As the paradigms show, semantically this tripartite personal opposition has its own
internal structure. The opposition ‘singular — non-singular’ (sg — nsg) consists of six deictic
items. Elementary single entities are defined in terms of speech act participants (1sg = ‘speaker’,
2sg = ‘hearer’) and non-participants of the speech act (3sg = ‘somebody’). Non-singular entities
are totalities of elementary entities: 1nsg = ‘speaker and hearer/somebody’, 2nsg = ‘hearer and
somebody’, 3nsg = ‘somebody and somebody’ (i.e. the countable number opposition of
homogenous entities is present only in the 3rd person). Exactly these entities are ordered in the
Deictic Hierarchy (see Figure 1 below). The arrangement of non-singular entities with respect to
singular entities is semantically motivated. Thus, ‘1nsg’ includes, besides the speaker, the hearer
and/or the 3rd person. Such an entity is lower on the Hierarchy than ‘1sg’. Simultaneously this
entity is higher than ‘2sg’, because it includes the speaker, and this factor is most important for
the Hierarchy. The motivation for ‘2nsg’ is similar.
Within the scope of the non-singular there is a proper number opposition of dual and plural
(du and pl), because the number of homogenous elementary entities increases, and this opposition
uses iconically specific coding devices (see 2.1.1.2.4). Dual does not have a surface expression (it
is possible to postulate the zero marker), and plural is expressed by a specific morpheme —
pluralizer -la.
In that way the prototypical number opposition is represented in the subsystem of 1/2nd
person nsg, and partially in 3rd person sg/nsg.

The conjugation of the intransitive verb ‘jump’ and the transitive verb ‘beat’ are
presented in Appendix. The linear structure of the finite verb form is presented in
Table 1. The nucleus of the form is its verb stem. It has the zero rank. Morpheme
slots that precede the stem (prefixes) have negative rank numbers increasing from
right to left. The slots following the stem (suffixes) have positive rank numbers
increasing from left to right.

Quantitative reduction follows the rule:
a long vowel is shortened in post-stressed position, i.e.
(14) Vlong ⇒ Vshort / Vstressed ..._
Examples: HÔlyHal (< HAly=HAl < {HAlyred}) ‘axe’, rarôtenyk (< {rara-tEny-k})
‘near a house’, rarôkinegym (< rara-kin-Egym < {rara-kina-jgym}) ‘the one from a
house (1sg)’, @í11a (< yllA < {ylla@-∅}) ‘mother’.
1.3.8. Fortitions
Fortitions are represented in Alutor by the following two phonological processes:
1) expressive vowel lengthening;
2) consonant gemination.
1.3.8.1. Expressive Vowel Lengthening
Expressive vowel lengthening takes place in certain “expressive” words − the
“distant” vocative, the “distant” locative and others. Although expressive vowel
lengthening is not a regular process, we think it possible to give here approximate
rules:
in expressive words short vowels y, a, i, u change into mid long vowels O, O, E, O
respectively, i.e.
(15) a. y ⇒ O / in expressive words
b. a ⇒ O / in expressive words
c. i ⇒ E / in expressive words
d. u ⇒ O / in expressive words
Examples: NOnyk (< {Nan-k} ‘there far away (the distant locative)’, cf. Nônyk
‘there’; @ômkykO (< {a-mk-ka} ‘very many’, cf. @ômkyka ‘many’; &mitE (< {miti∅}) ‘oh, Miti (the distant vocative)’ , cf. &miti ‘‘oh, Miti (a mythological proper
name)’, &@awEn (< {awin}, the contracted form of {awinaN-∅}) ‘oh, crab (the
distant vocative)’ along with @awønaN ‘oh, crab’.
1.3.8.2. Consonant Gemination
In some rare cases the root-final obstruent t is geminated, so that the preceding
syllable becomes closed. The process is partly morphologically defined, since roots
geminating their final consonants form a restricted group of the lexicon (the
corresponding words are given in the Dictionary). Some roots ending in t do not
demonstate this alternation, cf. arôt-i ‘(s)he fell’.
The rule regulating consonant gemination runs as follows:
if a root is marked for gemination, its root-final obstruent t is geminated29immediately before a word-final vowel, provided the preceding vowel is a stressed
one, i.e.
(16) t ⇒ tt / #CVstressed _-V2# and t ∈ Rgemination
Examples: jôtti (< jôt-i < {jat-j}) ‘(s)he came’; cf. tyjôtytkyn (< {t-jat-tkyn}) ‘I
am coming’.
Consonant gemination is obviously related to syllable addition when the
consonant is geminated too − see 1.3.8.2.
1.3.9. Regular Contact Consonant Assimilations
Contact assimilation of consonants is a wide spread phenomenon not only in Alutor,
but also in its related languages − Chukchi and Koryak. Most Alutor assimilations are
regressive, but some are progressive. In Alutor assimilations take place only
intervocalicly (that is at a syllable boundary). In some cases an intervocalic position
appears after an epenthetic schwa has been inserted, for instance, gônmylin (< {gatm-lin}) ‘(s)he killed him/her’. Most changes given below occur irrespective of a
morpheme boundary between the changing segment X and the context (but
assimilations are optional at a composite boundary). In order to simplify the formal
rules we omit here syllable and morpheme boundary markers. It should also be noted
that the dental t of a person-number verbal prefix is not assimilated at a morpheme
boundary before a root consonant (this information is also omitted in the rules), cf.
mytlô@utkyn (= {myt-la@u-tky-n}) ‘we see him/her/it’.
The following types of assimilation occur in Alutor:
1) partial assimilation of the dental t before nasals, namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent dental t changes into the corresponding
nasal (of the same place of articulation) immediately before a nasal m, n, nJ, or N
(see also rule (19)), i.e.
(17) a. t ⇒ n / _m
b. t ⇒ n / _n or _nJ
c. t ⇒ n / _N
Examples: gônmylin (< {ga-tm-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he is killed’, @akminnin (< {akmit-ni-n}) ‘(s)he took him/her/it’, varônJnJaqu (< varan-nJaqu < {varat-nJaqu-∅}) ‘a
lot of people’, ganNôlin (< {ga-tNa-lin(a)}) ‘it grew’.
2) complete assimilation of the dental t before sonorant dentalveolars, namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent dental t changes into the corresponding
sonorant immediately before a sonorant dentalveolar 1, 1J, or r (see also rules (17)
and (19)), i.e.
(18) a. t ⇒ l / _l or _lJ
b. t ⇒ r / _r30Examples: vitôllat (< {vit-at-la-t}) ‘they worked’, tírran (< {t-tra-n) ‘I tore
it’.
3) contact dentalveolar palatalization, namely:
at a syllable boundary a non-palatalized dentalveolar t, n, or l changes into its
palatalized correlate immediately before the corresponding palatalized
dentalalveolar s, nJ, or lJ respectively, i.e.
(19) a. t ⇒ s / _s
b. n ⇒ nJ / _nJ
c. l ⇒ lJ / _lJ
Examples: @arôssityk (< {arat-sit-k}) ‘pour’, mytônJnJaqu (< {mtan-nJaqu})
‘big mosquito’, @ystãlJlJyqyk (< ystul-lJyqy-k < {ystul-lJq-k}) ‘on a table’.
4) palatalization of the sonorant dentals n, l before the palatal j (here both
segments change), namely:
at a syllable boundary a non-palatalized dental n or l together with the
following palatal j change into the corresponding geminated palatalized dental nJnJ
or lJlJ respectively, i.e.
(20) a. nj ⇒ nJnJ
b. lj ⇒ lJlJ
Examples: tínJnJun (< ty-nju-n < {t-nju-n}) ‘I guarded him/her/it’, tilJlJøta (<
{til-jita}) ‘by a wing’.
5) complete assimilation of the nasal n before sonorant dentoalveolars, namely:
at a syllable boundary a sonorant nasal n changes into the corresponding
sonorant dentalveolar immediately before a sonorant dentalveolar l or r, i.e.
(21) a. n ⇒ l / _l
b. n ⇒ r / _r
Examples (this assimilation is attested only for the medial variant of the
causative marker -n-): tyllóvyn (< {t-n-levy-n}) ‘I took him/her/it (with me)’,
tyrrItylavyn (< {t-n-rItyla-av-n}) ‘I saw him/her/it in (my) dream’.
6) complete assimilation of the uvular q, namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent uvular q changes into k when it is
immediately preceded by a velar k, i.e.
(22) q ⇒ k / _k
Examples: tôkkin (< {taq-kin(a)}) ‘why’.
7) complete progressive assimilation of the labial v , namely:
at a syllable boundary an obstruent labial v changes into w immediately after a
labial w, i.e.
(23) v ⇒ w / w_
Examples: tíwwak (< ty-wva-k < {t-gva-k}) ‘I stuck’.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"1.1.1.2. Phonological Status of Schwa
The phonological status of schwa is one of the most interesting problems of the
Chukchi-Kamchatkan phonology. Some authors (see, for instance, [Zhukovа 1968])
regard this vowel as a purely auxiliary segment and do not include it in the inventory
of phonemes. Actually, the fact that the schwa is predictable in many contexts is
rather obvious. In such cases the surface representation of a word containing y can be
derived from the underlying representation without y (= the “non-vocalized”
representation) by means of simple insertion rules (see 1.3.3.2). For example, if a
word sounds like tyjôtyk ‘I came’, it can be derived from *tjatk. Here the schwas
break up the word-initial and the word-final consonant clusters. Thus, in this word, as
well as in many other words, y is just an epenthetic. This means that the schwa is
1Previously, long vowels were found neither in Alutor nor in any other ChukchiKamchatkan language (cf. [Moll 1955; Zhukova 1968] and others).",[3]
"3839CHAPTER 2. Morphology
In this chapter we consider the main word classes, rich in inflectional morphology,
namely, the verb, adjective, noun, and pronoun.
2.1. Verbs
The verbs can be divided into two classes, f i n i t e (inflected) and n o n - f i n i t e .
Finite forms are defined as compatible with the head predicate position of an
independent clause. Non-finite forms can occupy the head predicate position of a
subordinate clause as well as be part of the analytical verb form.
Finite forms have several conjugations depending on the number of agreement
slots. First of all there are polypersonal and monopersonal conjugations. In
p o l y p e r s o n a l conjugation the verb has two agreement slots: a prefix and a suffix
slot. Transitive verbs agree with the agentive and patientive arguments (referred to
below as A - a n d P - a r g u m e n t s ). Intransitive verbs agree with the sole core
argument 46 (referred to below as S - a r g u m e n t ). It is important that the S/Aargument, i.e. the argument bearing the Principal hyperrole (see argumentation
below) is the main controller of agreement. In m o n o p e r s o n a l conjugation the verb
has only one agreement slot – the suffix slot controlled by the S/P-argument, i.e. the
argument bearing the Absolutive hyperrole. Furthermore there is a number of
i m p e r s o n a l forms that do not distinguish person values of core arguments.
First, we will consider three conjugation types of finite and non-finite verb
forms.
2.1.1. Polypersonal conjugation of finite verb
Polypersonal conjugation is notable for a specific set of grammatical categories as
well as agreement encoding.
2.1.1.1. Grammatical categories of polypersonal conjugation
Polypersonal conjugation is specified by the following categories: aspect, mood, and
person-number agreement with the core arguments of intransitive and transitive
verbs. There are two values for a s p e c t : perfective (PF) and imperfective (IPF).
P e r f e c t i v e has an unmarked value, it coincides with the verb's stem,
i m p e r f e c t i v e has a suffix marker -tky /-tkyn /-tkyni (its ending depends on the
type of the following morphemes 47 ).
46
47In this case both agreement slots are used, see below.
The distribution of the imperfective’s allomorphs (-tky /-tkyn /-tkyni-) is not quite clear.","[38, 39, 40]"
"22A. 31 a. C1-C2-C3 ⇒ C1[-]C2-C3 / V1_V2 and C2 = Pref @
b. C1-C2-C3 ⇒ C1-C2[-]C3 / V1_V2 and C2 = Pref n
c. C1-C2-C3 ⇒ C1[-]C2-C3 / V1_V2 and C2 = Suf N and C3V2 ≠ Suf ki
d. C1-C2-C3 ⇒ C1-C2[-]C3 / V1_V2 and C2 = Suf N and C3V2 = Suf ki
Examples: mín@ypi1alatkyn (< {myn[-]@-pila-la-tk-n}) ‘we would leave
him/her/it’; mytíntakravna (< {myt-n[-]takr-av-na}) ‘we would get him/her/it
down’; @atôn@alNyka (< {a-ta-n@al[-]N-ka}) ‘(s)he does not want to become’, cf.
tan@ôlyNki (< {ta-n@al-N[-]ki}) ‘want to become’.
Evidently, the rules marking irrelevant boundaries precede the schwa insertion
rules, namely rules (6c), (6d).
1.3.3.3. Schwa and Consonant Metathesis
According to rule (6c), in the string C1-C2C3 the schwa is inserted at a morpheme
boundary, that is between C1 and C2, but in many words it actually appears between
C2 and C3, so that C1 and C2 occur adjacently. This usually happens when C1 and C2
are homorganic consonants (namely dentalveolars). We treat this transformation as
metathesis of a schwa and a consonant.
The metathesis rules run as follows:
if a three-consonant cluster of the underlying representation has been broken
up by a schwa, the vowel may change places with the second consonant, provided the
first and the second consonant are dentalveolars 32 , i.e.
(7)a. y-C2 ⇒ -C2y / C1_C3 and C1,C2 are dentalveolars (optionally)
b. y=C2 ⇒ =C2y / C1_C3 and C1,C2 are dentalveolars (optionally)
Examples: tyHí1ly@yn (< tyHyly-l@y-n < {tHyl-l@-n}) ‘sick (person)’, cf.
nymíl@yn (< {nym-l@-n}) ‘settled person, villager’.
1.3.4. Stress Assignment Algorithm
In order to create the right rhythmic structure, we need three types of rules:
1) rules regulating syllabification – the syllabification rules proper and the
syllable marking rules (1.3.4.1);
2) rules regulating accentuation – the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.2);
31As this rule describes only the boundary marking, not a phonological process, it is
numbered with a capital letter.
32
Metathesis of this type is attested not only for dentalveolars, but also for some other types
of consonants. For example, the same change occurs when one of the consonants is the causative
marker − the prefix -n-, while the other consonant is not a dentalveolar, cf. myt-y-n-gyjulavyn (<
{myt-n-g(y)jul-av-n}) ‘we taught him/her’ (the root {g(y)jul}), cf. nojulqin (< ny-gjul-qin < {ng(y)jul-qin(a)}) ‘educated’. We fail to describe such examples by means of standard rules.","[22, 23]"
"32in meaning and therefore are treated on the synchronic level as different affixes, cf. {l@at} ‘iterative action’ − {-s@at} ‘constant action’ (see the list of affixes in the
Dictionary). All these facts show that the distant palatalization in Alutor cannot be
described in terms of formal rules, so the exact distribution of the alternants is
lexically defined (see the Dictionary).

1.3.12. Practical Transcription of Alutor Words
In order to write Alutor words we use a simplified variant of the phonetic
transcription, which we refer to as the practical transcription. The simplifications we
use are the following:
1) we omit the glottal stop in word-initial position before a vowel, cf. alpínNyn
[@alpínNyn] ‘patch’;
2) in most words we do not mark vowel length on e and o (see 1.1.1.3), cf.
jepílNyn [jEpílNyn] ‘hoof’, rarôtenyk [rarÔtenyk] ‘near a house’, but we do mark the
length of e and o in expressive words (see 1.1.1.3), cf. qolomE [qolomE] ‘that’s
great!’;
3) we do not mark vowel length on stressed vowels i, u, a occuring in open
syllables, cf. tøtyk [tØtyk] ‘I was’;
4) we always mark vowel length on originally long vowels I, U, A, except in
closed syllables, cf. jØlyjil [jØlyjil] ‘tongue’, jIlítkuk [jIlítkuk] ‘gossip’;
5) we usually transcribe the palatalized correlate of t as s (except some rare
examples in texts when it is pronounced like tJ), cf. nysôsaqin ‘tasty’.
And finally, since the stress assignment rules in Alutor are rather simple, we do
not mark stress in Alutor words except in this section.
1.3.12. How Phonological Rules Apply
Here are some examples of how the above-listed phonological rules apply to
underlying representations. They illustrate situations where one rule creates a context
for applying another rule.
Example 1. {inmred} ‘rock (Nsg)’ (rule 1c) ⇒ inm=in (rule 5a) ⇒ @inm=in
(rule 5b) ⇒ @inm=@in (rule 6d) ⇒ @inmy=@in (rules Ba, Bb) ⇒ |@in|my|@in| (rules
Ca, Cc) ⇒ − ∪ − (rule IIIc) ⇒ [@ønmy=@in]; the practical transcription is ønmy@in
‘rock’.
Example 2. {(l)qyt-j} ‘go away (3sg pf)’ (rule 2a) ⇒ qyt-j (rule 6b) ⇒ qyty-j
(rules Вa, Bb) ⇒ |qy|ty-j| (rules Ca, Cc) ⇒ ∪ − (rule IIb) ⇒ qytí-j (rule 8a) ⇒ [qytíjjy]; the practical transcription is qytíjjy ‘(s)he went away’.
Example 3. {myt-n-takr-av-n} ‘get (smth./smb.) down (1pl-3sg pf)’ (rule Ab)
⇒ myt-n[-]takr-av-n (rule 6b) ⇒ myt-n[-]takr-avy-n ⇒ (rule 6с) ⇒ myty-n[]takr-avy-n (rules Вa, Bb) ⇒ |my|ty-n[-]|tak|r-a|vy-n| (rules Ca, Cb, Cc) ⇒ ∪ −...
(rules IIIb) ⇒ [mytí-n[-]takr-avy-n]; the practical transcription is mytíntakravyn
‘we got him/her down’.
Example 4. {ragred} ‘ptarmigan (Nsg)’ (rule 1a) ⇒ rag=rag (rule 9b) ⇒36raw=raw (rules Ba, Bb) ⇒ |raw=|raw| (rule Cc) ⇒ − − (rule IIa) ⇒ rôw=raw (rule
10b) ⇒ rÙ=rO (rule 14) ⇒ [rÙ=ro]; the practical transcription is rùro ‘ptarmigan’.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]"
"95The final vowel truncation is accompanied by standard phonological processes,
cf. tatul (root {tatula}) ‘fox’, but akyk (root {akka}) ‘son’, imyt (root {imti}) ‘burden’
(since consonant clusters do not occur word-finally, a schwa is inserted here − see
1.3.3).
The inflectional ending -n is added to stems ending in either a vowel or a
consonant 104 , cf. gytga-n (< {gytga-n}) ‘late autumn’, nalgy-n (< {nalg-n}) ‘fur
skin’.
The inflectional ending -lNyn is usually used with nouns denoting body parts
(both human and animal's), names of animals, and also with nouns denoting one
object of a pair, cf. vilu-lNyn ‘ear’, masvi-lNyn ‘animal's chest’, Higy-lNyn (< {HiglNyn}) ‘wolf’, lili-lNyn ‘mitten’. After stems ending in a homorganic consonant the
inflectional ending -lNyn appears as -lyNyn (see 1.3.3.3), cf. aNar-lyNyn ‘star’.
The inflectional ending -qal is used only with nouns denoting one object of a
pair, cf. pylak-qal (along with pylaky-lNyn) ‘fur boot’, lili-qal (along with lili-lNyn)
‘mitten’.
The inflectional ending -Na is used with a few nouns that probably belong to
the original Alutor lexicon: ypa-Na ‘soup’, kuka-Na ‘pot’, mami-Na ‘fish drying
shed’, qura-Na ‘reindeer’, rara-Na ‘yurt, house’, ruru-Na ‘bed, sleeping place, titiNa ‘needle’, typa-Na ‘stone hammer’.
Many original and some loan-words form the nominative singular by copying
(= reduplicating) the root morph. Such words belong to different semantic groups, cf.
anu-@an (< {anured}) ‘spring’, wiru-wir (< {wirured}) ‘(kind of) salmon’ (for
reduplication rules see 1.3.1).
The ergative markers -a/-ta are distributed according to the final segment of a
stem: the variant -a is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -ta is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tyrg-a ‘meat, ERG’,
jIl-a (< {jIly-a}) ‘tongue, ERG’, , but gytka-ta ‘leg, ERG’.
In the locative the inflectional ending -ki is characteristic of stems ending in N
(and sometimes in w), in other cases the ending -k or its phonological variant -kki are
used (the latter − after a stressed vowel), cf. lyqlaN-ki ‘winter, LOC’, rara-k ‘house,
ERG’, mimly-k ‘water, LOC’, but lylô-kki ‘eye, LOC’.
The dative, as well as the lative (the latter can be treated historically as a double
case composed of the locative and dative items), has no variants.
In the prolative the morph -gypyN is used with the stems ending in a single
consonant, while in other cases the morph -jpyN is used. If a stem ends in the vowel 104If a stem ends in a consonant, an epenthetic y is inserted to break up an illicit consonant
cluster (see 1.3.3.2).","[95, 96]"
"The d a t i v e is used to indicate: a) the Addressee of an action − see (72а), b)

illicit consonant clusters.
However, in some other cases the schwa is unpredictable, because it is difficult
or even impossible to formulate more or less standard phonological rules defining
schwa epenthesis in the non-vocalized representation. In such situations the fact that a
schwa is pronounced in a given word can be explained only by the individual
property of a given morpheme. In other words, we think that in such cases y should be
considered an inherent constituent of the corresponding morpheme. Many roots and
affixes therefore contain the schwa in the underlying representation, cf. the root {ypa}
‘soup’ appearing in the following words: @ypôNa (< {ypa-Na})‘soup’, tynypatyn (<
{t-n-ypa-at-n}) ‘I cooked it’ 2 . We also treat some root-medial y that always appear
in one the same place in a morpheme as part of the corresponding underlying
representation, cf. tímkytym 3 ‘hummock’, gatímkylin ‘covered with hummocks’ (the
root {tymk}); tyHylyk ‘be ill’, gatHíllin ‘(s)he fell ill’ (the root {tHyl}), myt-jôn-myk
(< {myt-jat-myk}) ‘we (two) came’ (the prefix {myt} and the suffix {myk}). In other
words, we always include the schwa in the underlying representation in case is not
inserted by means of the standard rules listed below. On these grounds we consider
the schwa an independent phoneme of Alutor.
Thus, schwas in Alutor words can be of two different origins: some y are part of
the underlying representation (“original” y), some appear only in the surface
representation, they are epenthesized by means of standard rules (“epenthetic” y). In
the phonetic transcription we write the vowel y in all positions, as all linguists2We treat the glottal stop in @ypANa as a segment epethesized before a word-initial vowel (a
situation similar to German, Arabic etc.). We can certainly choose another variant for the
underlying representation – without y, but with the initial @ , that is {*@pa}, but in this case the
second word would appear as *tynApavyn (< *ty-ny-@pa-vy-n < *{t-n-@pa-v-n}), because in
syllable-final position y@ changes into A (this alternation is typical for the conjunctive − see 1.3.6).
Since it is not the word we have in reality, we choose {ypa} as the underlying representation.

The non-epenthetic vowels y coming from the underlying representation are underlined

"2.4. Pronouns
2.4.1. Personal pronouns
Free personal pronouns for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person, singular, dual and plural,
occur in Alutor. The 3rd person singular does not distinguish between either human/
non-human or animate/ non-animate. Substantivized demonstratives are also used as
3rd person pronouns (see below).
Dual and plural pronouns are derived from one and the same stem and differ
only in the nominative and sometimes in the ergative, in other oblique cases one and
the same form is used for each case (in the ergative the difference between the dual
and plural can be marked through verbal agreement). Thus, there are 9 pronouns, but
only 6 pronominal stems: {gym} ‘I’ (NOM gymmy), {gyt} ‘you (sg)’ (NOM gytty),
{yn-/y-} 110 ‘(s)he/it’ (NOM ynnu), {mur} ‘we’ (NOM muri ‘we two’, NOM
muru(wwi) ‘we’), {tur} ‘you (nsg)’ (NOM turi ‘you two’, NOM turu(wwi) ‘you
(pl)’)’, {yt} ‘they’ (NOM ytti ‘they two’, NOM ytuwwi ‘they’).
Personal pronouns have much in common with nominal forms of the noun: they
are used in the same syntactic positions and are marked for case. But, unlike nouns,
personal pronouns are not incorporated, they are used only as autonomous words.
Adjectives derived from pronominal stems and similar to adjectival forms of the noun
belong to another group of pronouns − possessive pronouns.
Alutor personal pronouns have approximately the same set of cases as nouns.
10 cases are distinguished: n o m i t a t i v e , e r g a t i v e , l o c a t i v e , d a t i v e ,
prolative, contactive, causal, equative, comitative, associative.
As for the Lative, its pronominal form is likely to coincide with the dative form, so it
is not represented in the list of cases.
There is some divergence from the case system of nouns as regards the
realization of different cases.
The nominative singular is marked with a zero morph; in the 1st and 2nd person
110The morph y- is usually used before markers beginning with n-.",[104]
"RES-door=open-RES+3sg.Sthat=man-DATThe bear opened the door of the person's (house) [= to that person]. [12:1]In (15a) the transitive verb ‘go around’ becomes intransitive and agrees in nonsingular with the contextually retrievable S-argument ‘dogs’. In (15b) there is an
overt S-argument keNyn ‘bear’ of the intransitivized verb ‘open’. The benefactive
preserves its marking as a peripheral argument. However, it is not obligatory. In the
context of patient incorporation a benefactive can be promoted to the nominative
position, transitivity of the verb being preserved:
123Such insight on incorporation is widely presented in the works on Chukotko-Kamchatkan
languages, cf. [Skorik 1948; 1977; Zhukova 1953; 1972; Muravyova 1989b; 1990b].",[118]
"9most cases it is a plosive, but sometimes it sounds like an affricate 13 .
Laryngeals deserve special consideration. The glottal stop @ is sometimes used
as an auxiliary segment, for instance, it is found before any word-initial vowel. In
such contexts the glottal stop is predictable: it is inserted in accordance with the
standard rules (see 1.3.3.1). But in other contexts this segment is unpredictable, so it
must be treated as part of the underlying representation, cf. ny@ôlyk (< {n@al-k})
‘become’ (the root {n@al}), @yllô@a (< {ylla@-a}) ‘by a mother’ (the root {ylla@}),
nymôl@a (< {n-mal-@a}) ‘well’ (the circumfix {n-...-@a}). In syllable-final position
the glottal stop behaves similar to the glides w and j (see 1.3.6). The sound H is an
epiglottal plosive laryngeal, that is a glottal stop accompanied by epiglottis
lowering 14 . Due to such configuration the larynx becomes closed and the pharynx is
narrowed in its lower part. Like the uvular q, the Alutor H is also slightly
pharyngealized. That is why both q and H make the adjacent vowels more wide. There
is an obvious contrast between the sounds @ and H, cf. jã@yk ‘reach’ − vøHyk ‘die’, but
the fact was not mentioned in previous papers on Alutor 15 .
1.1.2.3. Sonorants
Among the sonorants the most numerous group is the nasals; here we find the labial
m, two dentals – the non-palatalized n and the palatalized nJ, and the velar N.
Laterals are represented by the non-palatalized l and the palatalized lJ.
The palatalized dentals nJ and lJ belong to the same place of articulation as their
non-palatalized correlates l and n. The non-palatalized dentals t, n and l, like all other
non-palatalized sounds, are not velarized 16 , that is why they do not velarise the
following front vowels. It should be also noted that the opposition n/nJ, l/lJ is not
neutralized before the front vowels, so both variants − a palatalized and a nonpalatalized one − occur there (cf. kôlik ‘write’ vs. kalJøsityk ‘write (repeatedly)’).
The remainder of the sonorants do not require special comment. The consonants
13That is why in Russian borrowings the Russian fricative x changes into the Alutor q, cf.
qylJøppy ‘bread’ (from the Russian xl’eb), @ãrvaq ‘shirt, dress’ (from the Russian rubáxa), &kolqos
‘collective farm’ (from the Russian kolxóz).
14
In the Koryak language [Zhukova 1972] the corresponding phoneme is realised as the
fricative pharyngeal and is written in the transcription as h.
15
The initial Alutor @ corresponds to the Koryak laryngeal @, while the non-initial Alutor @
and H (the latter – both initially and non-initially) correspond to the Koryak pharyngeal fricative
H, cf. the corresponding Koryak words jãHyk ‘reach’, vøHyk ‘die’.
16
Actually, sometimes there occurs a velarized variant of l (we often transcribed this sound
as w, not as l), but this may be due to the influence of the Russian language, where l is strongly
velarized.","[9, 10]"
"96a, the morph -jpyN appears as -epyN; the same variant is used if a stem ends in a two
consonant cluster, because in such cases the epenthetic y is inserted, and the
combination yj in most cases changes into e, though in some rare cases – into i (see
1.3.6), so the marker -ipyN 105 may appear, cf. qaNJav-gypyN ‘ravine, PROLAT’, nutepyN (< {nuta-jpyN}) ‘land, PROLAT’, winv-epyN ~ winv-ipyN (< winvy 106 -jpyN <
{winv-jpyN}) ‘road, PROLAT’. The morphs -e and -i are short variants of the morphs
-epyN and -ipyN respectively.
The equative markers -u/-nu have the same distribution as the ergative markers
-a/-ta: the variant -u is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -nu is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tavHal-u ‘dried fish,
EQUAT’, keN-u (< {keNy-u}) ‘bear, EQUAT’, but ypa-nu ‘soup, EQUAT’.
The variants -a/-ta in the comitative and associative are identical with those of
the ergative and have the same distribution, cf. ga-qlavul-a ‘husband, COMIT’, gamasla-ta ‘butter, COMIT’, geqy-masla-ta ‘butter, ASSOC’.
2.3.1.2. Case functions
Below we enumerate the main functions of the Alutor cases.
The n o m i n a t i v e is used mostly to express the syntactic function of an S/Pactant, that is the Absolutive hyperrole, according to the ergative actant marking
strategy (see 3.0). The nominative (not a bare stem) is also used to express named
objects. Besides this, the nominative is used in the vocative position, with final vowel
lengthening (we treat this process as expressive vowel lengthening − see 1.3.8.1), for
instance, in the vocative we may use miti along with mitE 107 ‘Oh, Miti!’ (Miti is a
mythological woman’s name).
The e r g a t i v e is used to express the following functions: a) the A-actant of a
verb, that is the actant with an Agentive hyperrole, b) the instrument of an action, c)
the lowered actant of a verb in the antipassive construction (see 3.1.3.1). Beside the
Agent, the Agentive hyperrole in Alutor also includes the Experiencer. Thus, the
Agentive hyperrole is typical for verbs such as ‘take’, ‘cut’ (the Agent) / ‘see’, ‘wish’
(the Experiencer):

"At the same time, it is important to note that in Alutor there are s y n t a c t i c contexts
favoring the antipassive. Thus in a relative clause the deleted coreferential NP should
be marked with the nominative. If in a primary diathesis this NP is marked with an
oblique case, antipassivization is necessary:

stuck’, it has the government pattern <smb.: E; smth.: N; in smth.: L>. In the primary
structure of the relative clause the coreferential NP ‘enemy’ takes the locative form,
therefore antipassivization takes place. In (14) the relativized NP ‘friends’ is marked
in its primary diathesis with the ergative, so the antipassive is used.
The usage of the antipassive has not been exhaustively investigated. It is
relatively rare in the texts, however the tendency for the syntactic usage of the
nominative is attested, i.e. the tendency towards syntactic ergativity in Alutor; see
[Kibrik 1979].",[117]

Identification clauses have the same structure as other nominal clauses: they consist
of two adjacent NPs being in a relation of referential identity. The auxiliary verb it‘be, be found’ marked with the resultative can also be used:
(47) a. waj-@ynnul-egym

3.4. Relative clause
In Alutor there are two main means of a relative clause formation — with the help of
the participle construction or the finite subordinate clause.
3.4.1. Participle strategy
The -l@- participle marks the head of a relative clause if both coreferential NPs are
marked with the nominative. The dependent NP can be omitted or reduced to a
relative pronoun maNin/maNki ‘which/where’ often combined with the correlative
pronoun qynut ‘as/such/there’ 127 .

CHAPTER 3. SyntaxCHAPTER 1. Phonology
In the present phonological sketch we will describe the following two main aspects of
Alutor phonology: the static aspect, that is inventories of units (segments and
suprasegmentals), and the dynamic aspect, that is phonological processes. The static
part deals with the sounds of Alutor − phones and phonemes (1.1), as well as the
syllable and rhythmic patterns (1.2). The dynamic part deals with the phonological
processes of Alutor, which are presented in the form of rewriting rules (1.3).
The approach we use here is similar to that of generative phonology (see also
[Kodzasov, Krivnova 1981]). Two levels of representing Alutor words are
distinguished: the underlying level, that is the level of phonemes (it corresponds to
the morphophonemic level in the Russian traditional phonology) and the surface
level, that is the level of phones, or systematic phonetic level (we omit some minor
details of Alutor pronunciation, irrelevant for the phonetic system). Rewriting rules
apply to the underlying representation of a word, which is a sequence of underlying
representations of the corresponding morphemes. Underlying representations of
Alutor morphemes are given in the Dictionary – see Part III. The application of
rewriting rules results in the surface representation, or the phonetic transcription.
In the present section the underlying representation of Alutor words and
morphemes is given in braces. Phonetic and practical transcriptions of words are
usually not parenthesized, but in some special cases the phonetic transcription is
given in square brackets. The application of rewriting rules is shown in round
brackets. The inventories of the surface and the underlying representations are
identical, that means we use one and the same chart of symbols for writing phones
and phonemes.
1.1. Segments
1.1.1. Vowels
1.1.1.1. Inventory
The vocalic system of Alutor consists of 11 vowels. They are: [i], [I], [u], [U], [e],
[E], [o], [O], [y], [a], [A]. The phonological status of each vowel is discussed further.
The Alutor vowels represent a typical triangle system. They are distinguished
in terms of q u a l i t y and q u a n t i t y . The aspects of quality are: t o n g u e h e i g h t
(high vs. mid vs. low), f r o n t n e s s / b a c k n e s s (front vs. central vs. back) and l i p
r o u n d i n g (rounded vs. unrounded).
The classification of vowels is given below in Table 1. The vowel [y], or schwa,
differs from all the other vowels both in length and in function. It is a supershort
vowel, while all the other vowels are of normal length (short or long – see below).","[1, 2]"
"10w and j are glides, which may coalesce with the preceding vowel syllable-finally (see
1.3.6). As we have mentioned above, the consonant @ also acts like a glide in the
same context.

1.2. Syllable and Rhythmic structure
1.2.1. Syllable Structure
Alutor imposes strict conditions on syllable structure, and the notion of syllable is
essential for the phonological pattern of the Alutor language.
If we consider the main classes of sounds − consonants and vowels − the
canonical syllable patterns will be |CV| and |CVC| (the symbol “ | ” indicates a
syllable boundary). These patterns have only one constraint: if the nucleus of a
syllable is a long vowel, the syllable has no coda. Thus, in reality we find the
following syllable patterns: |Cy|, |СVshort|, |CVlong|, |CyC|, |СVshortC| (here V is a nonschwa vowel), cf. |vi|tô|tyk| ‘work’, |tøl|my|til| ‘eagle’, |@øt|@yn| ‘fur coat’, |@a|lô|@al|
‘summer’, |jØ|ly|jil| ‘tongue’, |wi|rã|wir| ‘(kind of) salmon’, |ja|tít|kyn| ‘(s)he is
coming’.
The set of syllable patterns given above is valid only if we consider a careful,
distinct pronunciation, which we will call the standard pronunciation. In fluent speech
native speakers may often elide the schwa in a two or three consonant cluster (one of
the consonants is usually a sonorant), so there may appear some consonant clusters,
illicit in the standard pronunciation. Thus, we often find optional words pronounced
of other syllable types, such as |CCV| and |CCVC|, cf. qylôvul ~ qlôvul ‘husband’,
@ínkyjap ~ @ínkjap ‘long ago’ 17 . In the present paper we prefer to deal only with the
standard pronunciation.
Word boundaries in Alutor always coincide with syllable boundaries, for
instance, @ógyv|#@arNønati (not *@ógy|v#ar|Nønati) ‘It rained yesterday’.
In reduplications the boundary between the two root morphs also coincides with
the syllable boundary, cf. @ønmy|@in (< {inm=in}) ( not *@in|min) ‘gulp’. The same is
true with incorporations and productive compounds, but only if the second stem
begins with a vowel, cf. mis@ô=@it@yl@yn (< {mis@a=it-l@-n}) ‘the one in a beautiful
fur coat’, sasø=@ilNatgyrNyn (< {sasi=ilN-at-gyrN-n}) ‘watchstrap’. In some
compounds there is no glottal stop before an initial vowel of the second stem, and the
syllable begins with a preceding consonant, cf. tig-ølNyn (< {tig-ilN-N}) ‘ski strap’.
17The same situation is found in related languages. Some Koryak dictionaries (for instance,
[Korsakov 1939a]) register the standard pronunciation, while others (for instance, [Zhukova
1967]) record the fluent speech, cf. myjen ~ mjen ‘mosquito’. As P.Ja.Skorik writes [Skorik
1961:63], in Chukchi the process of omitting schwas “ is more widely spread in the western
dialect than in the eastern one”.","[10, 11, 12]"
"171.3.2. Deletions
The following types of deletions occur in Alutor:
1) initial consonant deletion;
2) final vowel deletion;
3) hiatus vowel deletion.
The first two processes are found only in particular restricted groups of roots
and affixes, so they are partly morphologically defined (the corresponding roots and
affixes are marked in the Dictionary). But since these types of deletion play an
important role in creating the canonical syllable structure, we find it necessary to
describe them together with phonologically defined processes.
1.3.2.1. Initial Consonant Deletion
Initial consonant deletion occurs most commonly in word-initial position and only in
a verb root beginning with a two-consonant cluster. The segments undergoing the
process are the dentalveolars t, s, n, 1. They are usually deleted immediately before a
labial, velar, uvular or laryngeal. The process is partly morphologically defined, since
roots truncating their initial consonants form a restricted group of the lexicon. In the
Dictionary the initial consonant of such roots is shown in round brackets, cf. {(t)va}
‘stay’, {(t)givi} ‘year’, {(t)kypl} ‘beat’, {(t)Hylwyt(i)} ‘day’. Some roots beginning
with the same clusters do not truncate their initial consonant, cf. tygótatyk (< {tgetatk}) ‘jump’. The deletion of a root-initial consonant is sometimes found in
composites 25 .
The rules regulating initial consonant deletion run as follows:
if a root beginning with a two-consonant cluster is marked for consonant
deletion, its root-initial consonant is deleted in word-initial position; the deletion may
also occur when the root appears as a non-initial part of a composite, i.e.
(2)a. C1 ⇒ ∧ / #_C2 and C1 ∈ Rconsonant deletion
b. C1 ⇒ ∧ / =_C2 and C1 ∈ Rconsonant deletion (not regularly)
Examples: kíplyk (< {(t)kypl-k}) ‘beat’, cf. ty-tkíply-n (< {t-(t)kypl-n}) ‘I
beat him’; @asgønHylJu (< {asgi-in(a)=(t)Hylw}) ‘today’.
1.3.2.2. Final Vowel Deletion
Final vowel deletion is typical of noun roots and also for some nominal suffixes. This
is usually found in the nominative singular or in the 3 person singular of adjectives
25The fact that a root-initial consonant can be deleted in composites shows that a non-initial
root tends to be similar to the beginning of a word.","[17, 18]"
"marked with the ergative and controls the prefix agreement slot in polypersonal
conjugation; the P-argument is marked with the nominative and controls the suffix
agreement slot in polypersonal conjugation. In monopersonal conjugation agreement
is controlled by the P-argument.
I n t r a n s i t i v e verbs have one core S-argument marked with the nominative
that controls the suffix agreement slot in monopersonal conjugation and both
agreement slots in polypersonal conjugation.
From the point of view of case marking Alutor uses the e r g a t i v e
alignment 117 , unifying the S/P-arguments (with the Absolutive hyperrole) and
opposing them to the A-argument. Monopersonal conjugation is analogous (the
Absolutive is the agreement controller). An interpretation of polypersonal conjugation
is more controversial. Namely, the S-, A- and P-arguments use different sets of
controlled agreement slots: The S-arguments control the prefix as well as suffix slots,
the A-arguments control the prefix slots and the P-arguments control the suffix slots.
Therefore, from the point of view of polypersonal conjugation the t r i p a r t i t e
alignment is realized. From the point of view of the marker's material form, the prefix
markers bring the A- and S-arguments in line with t h e a c c u s a t i v e alignment
(with the Principal hyperrole), opposing them to the P-argument; see 2.1.1.2.
In the suffix slots the sets of S- and P-markers are different, therefore the suffix
slot realizes the tripartite alignment opposing the S/A/P-arguments.
In Alutor there are different means of including a verb's arguments into the set
of core arguments as well as excluding them from the set of core arguments. The first
process is called i n c r e a s e , and the second one d e c r e a s e of their syntactic status.
These processes often take place simultaneously as the status of some argument
increases while the status of another one decreases.
From the point of view of the increase/decrease of the syntactic status, the
nominative position is the most important. This position is always present in a clause
(it can lack material form in the context of ambient verbs or in case of ellipsis). It is
the target of all increasing processes. Therefore, the Absolutive hyperrole can
correspond to different primary semantic roles. In contrast to the nominative position,
the ergative position is stable from the point of view of its role identification: it
merges the agent and experiencer in the Agentive hyperrole. Almost always, it is the
initial position of the government pattern of the respective verb 118 . The only exception117For a more detailed discussion of the typology of syntactic constructions and the
corresponding hyperroles see [Kibrik 1997a].
118
This position can be added in the case of causativization, however in this case it is a
derivational process producing a new lexeme rather that a diathesis change.","[110, 111]"
"19boundary 27 , for instance, gøllin (< {ga-it-lin}) ‘(s)he/it was’.
NOTE. At first sight, the distribution of these two processes seems to be rather simple: one
is found at a composite boundary, the other – at an ordinary morpheme boundary. The problem is
to define what particular type of boundary appears in a word with two or more roots, that is in a
composite. Actually, we distinguish three types of composites: reduplications, incorporations and
compounds.
Some words appear with an epenthesized glottal stop between the vowels. Such situation is
typical of incorporations and reduplications, cf. gymík@unJunJuN (< {gymyk=unJunJu-N}) ‘to my
son’, @alô@al (< ala=al < {alared}) ‘summer’. Other words demonstrate vowel deletion. The latter
is typical of non-composites, cf. gøvlin *(< {ga-iv-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he said’. We regard these two
means of transforming hiatus as marking different degrees of coalescence between the parts of a
word: it is less so in case of epenthesis, and is more so in case of vowel deletion.
As for compounds, some of them epenthesize a glottal stop, while others delete a vowel, cf.
sasi=@ilNatgyrNyn ‘watchstrap’, but Haqømluk (< {Haqa-iml-u-k}) ‘drink vodka (=drink bad
water)’. We think that the difference between the two types of compounds lies in the degree of
coalescence, so compounds of the first group should be treated as productive compounds, while
compounds of the second group should be treated as non-productive ones (at least from the point
of phonology). We mark the difference in morphological representations of compounds by using
two different boundaries: in compounds like sasi=@ilNatgyrNyn (as well as in incorporations and
reduplications) we indicate a composite boundary, while in compounds like Haq-imluk we
indicate an ordinary morpheme boundary. When phonological rules apply, the type of boundary is
considered to has been already assigned to the underlying representation.","[19, 20]"
"311.3.10. Irregular Distant Dental Palatalisations
Alutor alternations which we call distant palatalizations are rather peculiar from a
typological point of view. The alternation itself looks like this: in some morphemes
(mostly roots) a dental non-palatalized consonant changes into its palatalized
correlate in the context defined by another morpheme of the same word (mostly an
affix), cf. vilJãpilJ (< {vilu-pilJ}) ‘little ear’. Since some such morphemes (but not all
of them) contain a palatalized consonant and the changing segment becomes a
palatalized one, we treat this process as distant palatalization, and refer to the
corresponding morphemes as “palatalizing” ones 43 .
The process takes place in roughly the following environment:
if there is a palatalizing morpheme in a word, a non-palatalized dental t, n, or l
changes into its palatalized counterpart s (seldom tJ), nJ, or lJ (in some cases s)
respectively, i.e.
(24) a. t ⇒ s (seldom tJ ) / ∃Mpalatalizing
b. n ⇒ nJ / ∃Mpalatalizing
c. l ⇒ lJ (in some cases s) / ∃Mpalatalizing.
Examples: gasvôs@atylqivlin (< {ga-(t)va-s@at-lqiv-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he was
sitting’, anJãs@atyk (< {anu-s@at-k}) ‘spend spring’, alJôs@atyk (< {ala-s@at-k})
‘spend summer’, nJyvøssykuk 44 (< {nvil-tku-k}) ‘stop (repeatedly)’, lJóvytkuk (<
{levy-tku-k}) ‘walk’, mysôtkuk (< {mla-tku-k}) ‘break’.
But in reality the distribution of the alternants and the context they appear in
turn out to be more complicated than it is shown in the above-mentioned rule. First,
palatalizing morphemes may not contain a palatalized consonant 45 , cf. HønJnJykvyn (<
{Hinn-kv-n}) ‘scarf’ ({kv} is a palatalizing suffix). Second, palatalizing affixes may
cause palatalization in one root and not affect another root, cf. lJóvytkuk (< {levy-tkuk}) ‘walk’, but @ôngytytkuk (< {angyt-tku-k}) ‘celebrate’ ({tku} is a palatalizing
suffix). Third, it is difficult to find a strict distribution between the palatalized
consonants lJ and s (actually, we think that the alternation l/s is more ancient, while
l/lJ is an innovation). Fourth, there exist not only palatalizing affixes, but also
palatalizing roots, for palatalization appears in some affixes, cf. nJãmqin (< {n-umqin(a)}) ‘warm’ ({um} should be treated as palatalizing root), but nurôqin ‘distant’.
And finally, there are duplicate affixes with the alternation l/s, which slightly differ
43A.N.Zhukova [Zhukova 1972] refers to similar alternations in the Koryak language as
“consonant harmony”.
44
When the dental of a root is palatalized, the dental of an affix is usually palatalized too.
45
At the same time, if an affix has a palatalized consonant, it is not necessarily a palatalizing
one.","[31, 32]"
