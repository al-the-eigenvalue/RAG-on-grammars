"9.6 Argument disambiguation
In Hidatsa, the nominal clause arguments Agent, Subject, and Object are regularly omitted if
they are recoverable from the pragmatic context, preceding text, or from grammatical concord,
376therefore transitive constructions where both nominal arguments (Agent and Object) are overtly
realized are not common. New participants are often introduced as subjects of intransitive
clauses (e.g., “and then N came’) or objects of transitive clauses (e.g., ‘and then he saw N’). After
the new participant has been introduced, it seldom occurs as an overt noun phrase, unless the
participant structure needs to be refreshed after some other participant intervenes.
(36) is a passage from a traditional trickster story, told by Anna Wicker and recorded by
A. Wesley Jones in 1977. In the first sentence, the first participant, the mythical First Maker, is
introduced with an overt noun phrase which is not repeated again in the passage. In the second
sentence he sees two men, who are again introduced with an overt noun phrase. The two men are
referred to explicitly again in the third sentence when the focus shifts from the First Maker to the
men.

377The First Maker was travelling along (they say). He was roaming around, traveling
along the riverbank and scrutinizing the landscape; he was doing that, going around, and
there were two men sitting there, catching fish at the river (they say). Standing here he
watched them and he examined them and one could hear the men talking to each other,
but they were not looking around (they say). (Jones 1978: 5)
If a transitive clause has two overtly expressed arguments outside the verb stem, they
need to be disambiguated from each other. The need for disambiguation becomes even more
pronounced in light of the relatively flexible word order that Hidatsa has. The unmarked
constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons.
The order of A and B-set agreement prefixes on a transitive stem, which, with a few exceptions,
always follows the order O-A (B-set prefix followed by a A-set prefix), is never affected by the
pragmatic constituent order outside the stem.
Besides word order, Hidatsa relies on two strategies to disambiguate overtly expressed
clausal arguments. The first strategy relies on the relative ranking on the animacy scale (see 9.6.1)
and the second one on the relative ranking on the agentivity scale (see 9.6.2) .","[399, 400, 401]"
"5.3 Non-derived ditransitive verbs
A small number of non-derived ditransitive verbs subcategorize for two objects. Nevertheless,
utterances with the agent, direct object, and indirect object noun phrases overtly specified almost
never occur in natural discourse. Participants are typically introduced one by one in intransitive
or transitive clauses, and in intransitive clauses at least one of them is disambiguated by context.
Direct objects are disambiguated from indirect object mainly by word order, especially if other
clues, such as differences in animacy, are not available. The three most common ditransitive
active verbs are listed in (9) and an example with overt direct and indirect object is (10).

More examples and a table illustrating the full combinatory potential of pronominalprefixes with gúˀ and gahéè can be found in 17.5.2.
Boyle has suggested that in Hidatsa “there is a small set of transitive stative verbs” where
“both the pronominal subject and object are of the B-set” (Boyle 2007: 144). A partial paradigm
he provides is actually an example of the middle verb iighací to understand something. Although
middle verbs (see 3.3), which are inflected with C-set prefixes (1 mi-, 2 ní-, 3 i-), are normally
not transitive, there are at least two exceptions, as the object, indicated with a B-set prefix, can be
marked both on iighací and also iigigúà to hear sth. Accent on the C-set second person prefix nídisambiguates it from the unaccented B-set second person prefix nii-. Incorrect accent marking in
Boyle’s examples accounts for his erroneous analysis: his miiriikháciic you understand me should
have an accented C-set second person prefix, as in miiríìghacic (mii- 1B, ní- 2C, iighací
understand, -c DECL).
Although there are no stative verbs that are subcategorized for two arguments, two B-set
prefixes may co-occur with stems whose valence has been increased through the process of
causativization (see 4.7.2). In such cases the causee and object occur together initially in the
verb, as in (11) and (12). Note that additional data are required to account for the variation in the
order of the prefix for the causee object and the prefix for the object of the causative verb. The
agent (causer) in the examples is expressed by the pronominal indirect causative suffix.

"5.1 Split-intransitivity
From a typological perspective, Hidatsa is a split-intransitive type language (also known as an
active-stative type language). This means that the core arguments of a clause are marked by two
types of pronominal prefixes that are grouped into two sets: the A-set prefixes (1 maa-, 2 ná-, 3 Ø)
mark the transitive agent and the subject of the first subset of intransitive verbs, whereas the Bset prefixes (1 mii-, 2 nii-, 3 Ø) mark the transitive object as well as the subject of the second
subset of intransitive verbs. The primary principle that divides intransitives into the two subsets
is based on control: the S-argument is marked like an agent (A) if the subject is in control of the
intransitive activity; it is marked like a transitive object (O) if the subject is not in control of an
intransitive activity49. Since the grammatical subject S is marked by two different types of
prefixes, such a system is also known as a split-S alignment.
Intransitive verbs that mark the subject with B-set prefixes are called ‘stative verbs’. Most
of the stative verbs describe states and qualities, such as hisí to be red and xaráhxi be skinny, but
49The only exception to this generalization is the plural object prefix maa- (see 5.2) which never occurs in the roleof an intransitive subject.",[234]

"The ergative pronoun is also used for emphasis and to assign contrastive focus to a
specific referent in order to differentiate it from other possible referents. In emphatic and
contrastive clauses the presence of the ergative pronoun indicates that, although the agent is
easily indentifiable, its particular referent rather than some other is being singled out. In English
the equivalent effect is achieved by stressing the appropriate pronoun or by the clefted phrase.",[436]
"Finally, there is an interesting group of Hidatsa personal names that are formed with the
vertitive goal suffix in order to express the wish that one return to his or her roots. Examples are
(38a-c).",[524]
"2085 Transitive verb inflection
Hidatsa employs two systems of morphosyntactic alignment that distinguish between the
arguments of transitive and intransitive verbs. The two core arguments of transitive verbs, agent
(A) and object (O), and the single core argument of intransitive verbs, subject (S), are marked
by (1) pronominal prefixes on verbs (split-intransitive alignment) and (2) suffixes on noun
phrases (ergative alignment, see 9.5).
Split-intransitive alignment, which is marked by pronominal prefixation on verbs, is
based on the notion of volition. In such systems, participants that are characterized by the
property of control over the activity are initiators of events. Such participants are marked on
verbs with A-set prefixes regardless of the valence of the verb. In contrast, participants that have
no control over the activity, such as objects in transitive clauses and S-arguments of verbs that
describe states, are marked on verbs with B-set prefixes.
Since some S-arguments are clearly in control of the activity that certain intransitive
verbs describe (e.g., diríá to run, awáàgi to sit down), they are marked in the same way as Aarguments of transitive verbs, that is, with A-set prefixes. S-arguments that are not in control of
activities and states described by the second type of intransitive verbs (e.g., hiirá to be slow,
háchageegi to hiccup) are marked on verbs in the same way as O-arguments of transitive verbs,
that is, with B-set prefixes. Because the marking of S-arguments is split along the lines of
volition (Sa=A; So=O), this system is known as the split-intransitive alignment.
In other words, in a split-transitive system some subjects of intransitive verbs are treated
in the same way that subjects of transitive verbs are treated, while other subjects of intransitive
verbs are treated in the same way that objects of transitive verbs are treated.","[231, 232]"
"9.5 Ergativity
The ranking of grammatical relations between the matrix verb and and its syntactic arguments is
represented through the syntactic encoding of participant roles. Whereas the Hidatsa verbal
system follows the split-intransitive alignment (see 5.1), its nominal system follows the ergativeabsolutive alignment, whereby the A-argument (agent) of a transitive verb can be marked with
an ergative case, while the S-argument (subject) of an intransitive verb and the O-argument
(object) of a transitive verb are left unmarked for the absolutive case. In other words, ergative
alignment, which is marked by case marking on noun phrases, categorizes all intransitive Sarguments like transitive O-arguments of transitive verbs – both are left unmarked. The Aargument of transitive verbs is specified by the ergative case suffix -rí.
The ergative suffix has three allomorphs. When suffixed to a word-final light syllable
(CV) whose onset is the stop g or the fricative c, it occurs as -hirí if preceded by a front vowel a
or i, as in (26). The ergative suffix occurs as -hurí if it is added to an obstruent-initial syllable
whose nucleus is the short back vowel u, as in (27). The short vowel before -hirí/-hurí is deleted.

obstruent, if a light syllable begins with a consonant cluster, or if the syllable is heavy (CVV).
Examples are in (28).

garíhgaariIn Hidatsa, the nominal clausal arguments A, S, and O are regularly left unspecified if
they are recoverable from the pragmatic context, preceding text, or from grammatical concord.
Transitive clauses with both core arguments realized as independent NPs are rare. A single overt
core argument may occur as a bare stem, or marked with either the indefinite article -wa, definite
article -s, the ergative suffix -ri, or one of the attributive demonstratives (see 10.2). The ergative
suffix -ri may also occur in conjunction with any of the articles or attributive demonstratives.
Case marking in Hidatsa is not based on the properties of the agent/subject alone, but
depends on the context.
In a transitive clause where both the agent and object are inflected for third person, a
single overt nominal argument is interpreted as the object unless it is marked with the ergative
suffix. In example (29a), the ergative suffix -hiri identifies the word icúùwasga horse as the
agent. The absolutive form (unmarked) in (29b) is grammatical, but pragmatically unacceptable.

"5.4 Object marking in causative stems
The principles of marking core arguments on a causative verb are similar to the description
above, except that the position of the pronominal causative affix, which marks the agent, is stemfinal. As in other transitive verbs, the B-set object prefixes, which mark the causee, are verbinitial and the plural suffix, if present, is added directly to the inflected causative suffix.
Examples of various transitive combinations with the causative stem gháhee to make somebody
laugh are in (14a-d).

construction seˀri after ihgás the mother is optional since the three arguments (ihgás the mother >
mii- 1B > ahí turnip) are disambiguated according to their relative ranking on the animacy and
agentivity scales (see 9.6.1 and 9.6.2).

Hidatsa and Crow prefix order in causative constructions is of interest from theperspective of comparative Siouan, since in Lakota the prefix for the causee goes on the
causative marker, not at the beginning of the whole stem; only prefixes for the object of the
causative verb go at the beginning of the whole stem.","[241, 242]"
"683 Verb classification
Typologically, Hidatsa is an active-stative type language. In transitive clauses the transitive
Agent (A) is marked with one set of pronominal prefixes and the transitive Object (O) with
another. The single argument in intransitive clauses, the intransitive Subject (S), is marked for
some verbs like (A) and for some verbs like (O). This type of morphosyntactic alignment is often
referred to as the Split Intransitive, or simply as Split-S (Dixon 1979: 82).
Most Hidatsa verbs, which can be classified on the basis of pronominal marking, fall into
three classes, conventionally labeled transitive verbs, intransitive verbs, and stative verbs. The
split-S pronominal marking in Hidatsa is illustrated in TABLE 3.1.

Ø / mii- / nii-Mithun’s (1991) observation that the division of monovalent verbs into active and stative
classes is motivated by volition or control is generally true in Hidatsa, but there are a few
exceptions. For example, the verbs déè to die and aríìdi to be hungry are both classified as active
intransitive verbs, even though the subject presumably has no control over either of these states.
Impersonal verbs are classified as statives, but they occur only in third person forms (with Ø
prefix).
A small number of Hidatsa verbs that occur in reflexive constructions or refer to bodily
movement defy classification based on straightforward valency. The pronominal system of such69verbs resembles both active verbs (accented second person prefix) and stative verbs (prefix
vowel i). Such verbs literally straddle the line between active and stative verbs on the one hand,
and transitive and intransitive verbs on the other. Following the example of more familiar IndoEuropean languages, such as classical Greek and Sanskrit, this pattern is termed the ‘middle
verb’.
Active, stative, and middle verbs can all be causativized. The causative marker is an
inflected suffix that follows the stem (see 4.7). Pronominal prefixes are not used with causative
verbs, except to indicate the transitive object.
Hidatsa marks three grammatical persons, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, that occur in four inflectional
patterns, which are the following:
A-set. Pronominal prefixes in the first set mark agents of transitive verbs and subjects of
intransitive verbs. Transitive and intransitive verbs form the class of active verbs. A-set prefixes
are subject to considerable allomorphy depending on the derivational class.
B-set. This set of pronominals marks the subjects of stative verbs. In transitive
constructions, B-set pronominals also mark the direct objects of transitive verbs (see 5.1).
C-set. The third set of prefixes marks the subjects of middle verbs, as well as objects of
postpositions. Verbs inflected with C-set prefixes describe actions that are performed by the
subject for his or her own benefit or in which the subject affects itself.
The third person is unmarked in the inflection of active and stative verbs; it is the bare
stem. It is, however, overtly marked in the middle and causative inflections. Pronominal prefixes
are identical in the singular and plural, and they are attached directly to the stem. The pronominal
suffixes of the caustive inflection, discussed in section 4.7, are also identical in the singular and
plural, but subject to ablaut when immediately followed by the plural marker -aˀ.","[91, 92, 93]"
"12.1 Pronominal D-words
Three D- words, dabéè to be who, dáàba to be what, and agudóò to be which one are stative
verbs that in a matrix clause occur mostly, but not exclusively, in questions. They are also
extremely common in the dependent conditional and concessive clauses, in which case they
function as nonassertive indefinite pronouns.
Two types of interrogative pronouns are derived from pronominal D-words by suffixation.
When either dabéè, dáàba, or agudóò substitutes for a noun that is an absolutive clausal
argument (i.e., an Object in a transitive or a Subject in an intransitive clause), it is followed by
the focus marker -wa (see 9.4). 110 When any of the three pronoun substitutes for a noun that is an
ergative argument (i.e., an Agent in a transitive clause), it is usually followed by the ergative
110I am hesitant to call -wa an absolutive case marker although this is clearly the main function of this suffix when itfollows any of the interrogative pronouns. The same suffix can also be used emphatically with pronouns (see 11.2.2)
that can substitute for any argument of the verb, although the unambiguously ergative pronoun iirahéèri is by far
more common than íìwa in the emphatic agentive argument role. The focus suffix -wa is also found in dóòhseewa
why where it is clearly not an absolutive case marker.",[444]
"9.4 Focus particle -wa
The focus particle -wa derives D-words and it is used emphatically with pronominal and
demonstrative stems.
When -wa is suffixed to the pronominal stem íì or the demonstrative pronouns hirí, gúá,
and seˀ, it emphasizes the main argument of the verb (see 11.2.2). The emphasized argument is
usually the intransitive subject or the transitive object, but the ergative agent is also occasionally
emphasized, especially if the first person pronoun is followed by a transitive verb agentively
inflected for first person (with A-set or causative pronominal affixes) or the second person
pronoun is followed by a transitive verb similarly inflected for second person. Third person
pronouns and the demonstratives that represent the ergative agent are usually followed by the
ergative suffix -rí because the emphatic form with -wa would be too ambiguous and could be
interpreted as the object of the transitive verb.",[391]
"9.6.2 Agentivity scale
Definiteness and case marking have an important role to play in disambiguating argument roles
in transitive clauses when (1) both outside arguments are animate, (2) both are inanimate, or (3)
the inanimate argument is the ergative agent and the animate argument the absolutive object.
The grammatical agent can be disambiguated in three ways: (1) it is marked with the
ergative case marker -rí; (2) the A-argument is marked with the definite article or an attributive
demonstrative (see 10.2) if the O-argument is indefinite or has no article; or, (3) the A-argument
is marked with the indefinite article if the O-argument is unmarked for definiteness.
The relative agentive values on the scale are presented in (39). Note that the attributive
demonstratives (e.g., -hee, éèhgu, éèraga, etc.) are ranked equally with the definite article -s.
(39)-rí ERG > -s DEF / DEM > -wa INDEF > Ø
The order of outside arguments in a transitive clause is not important since the A-argument is always disambiguated by its higher ranking on the agentivity scale relative to the Oargument. Thus ‘the cat’ in (40a) and (40b), marked with the definite -s, is always recognized as
the Agent regardless of its relative position in the clause since it outranks the unmarked Oargument ‘mouse’.

"17.2 Relative clauses
There are two basic relativizers, agu- and aru-, that mark relative clauses and which function as
all of, or part of, an element in the relative clause. Hidatsa relative clauses can be lexically
headed or occur without lexical heads.17.2.1 agu- ‘entitive relativizer’
The entitive relativizer agu-, which occurs as oo- before the obstruent g, functions as a
relativized element that is anaphorically linked to the head noun. In other words, the prefix
functions as a relative pronoun that refers to an antecedent in the preceding clause. The relative
prefix marks the position of the subject, agent, or object, as in (1).",[539]
"76The indefinite prefix can be attached to virtually any stative verb in order to create lexemesfor novel concepts and entities. For example, maacigída something sticky could be used as an ad
hoc reference to sticky candy. However, very often the meaning of maa- and a stative verb
sequence has become lexicalized and is unpredictable, as in (38).

"6.1.3 Commands
Commands are used to elicit action from one or more addressees either by directing them or
suggesting that they engage in an activity. Prohibitive, or negative, commands direct the
addressee to refrain from an activity. In Hidatsa, there are two types of commands. The more
common one is a prototypical imperative that has no other attitudinal connotations. The other
one, the precative, softens the tone of the command and makes it appear more like a polite
request or an entreaty rather than an order. Imperative and precative forms of active stems are
inflected for number but not for person. Commands formed from middle and reflexive verbs are
inflected for second person and number.",[266]

Hidatsa also allows what Miner (1986) termed Noun Stripping and Mithun (1984)
Composition by Juxtaposition. In the case of noun stripping, the noun and the verb remain
separate words phonologically but the juxtaposed noun is stripped of the articles, demonstratives,
and case markers. The demoted noun loses its status as a syntactic argument and the two
juxtaposed words function as a single intransitive predicate.
The effects of noun stripping are illustrated in (290). As we saw in 2.4.2, morpheme-final
vowels are often deleted at a morpheme boundary in compounds. If the affected syllable has a
long vowel, then invariably both moras are deleted. However, in (290a) the final syllable in the
juxtaposed noun, ihúù mother, loses only the second, unaccented, mora. According to section
2.4.3, the shortening of final long vowels is indicative of the right word boundary. This indicates
that in (290) both ihúù and áˀciwi are separate phonological words. Although the sentence in
(290a) appears to have AOV structure, the ergative case marker -rí in (290b) is not grammatical;
therefore, maagarísda child cannot be the transitive Agent and, as a corollary, ihúù mother
cannot be the transitive Object. Finally, since the definite article -s in (290c) cannot intervene
between ihúù, which is in the “object” position, and the verb that follows, the only possible
analysis is to treat ihúù and áˀciwi as a single grammatical word, which functions as an
intransitive predicate that happens to comprise two phonological words.","[227, 228]"
"40511 Independent personal pronouns
Hidatsa pronominals can be divided into bound pronominal prefixes that are obligatory and
optional free pronouns. 10211.1 Pronominal prefixes
Bound pronominals comprise three sets of prefixes that express the core arguments of the verb:
(1) the A-set marks the subject of intransitive and transitive active verbs, (2) the B-set marks the
subject of stative verbs, predicative nouns and quantifiers, and direct objects, and (3) the C-set
prefixes are used when an action is performed by the subject for his or her own benefit or in
which the subject affects itself. The pronominal prefixes are treated in Chapter 3, and the
combinations of them in Chapter 5.","[428, 429]"
"2.2 Phonotactics
2.2.1 Syllable structure
The canonical form of the syllable in Hidatsa is CV(V). All lexical stems end in a vowel. Codas
are restricted to the lexical glottal stop, a small number of utterance final consonantal speech act
markers (see 6.1) and other clausal suffixes (see Chaper 17), codas formed by final vowel
deletion in commands (see 6.1.3.1), and the definite article -s.
29A word begins with either a single phonemic consonant or the phonetic glottal stop
preceding vowel-initial syllables. There are no word-initial clusters except for a small number of
lexemes that begin with a Ch cluster, as illustrated in (41). Other types of consonant clusters are
licensed only morpheme internally and at morpheme boundary.

éè
éˀlong

as is the case with máàhdii vehicle in (43) and gíˀria ride in (44). Since content words consisting
of a single light syllable are not grammatical in Hidatsa (unless the onset is a cluster), a phonetic
[h] is added to the end of a monosyllable in order to keep it heavy, as the three examples in (45).
However, there are monosyllabic words and grammatical morphemes, such as míà woman, múá
fish, and -hgua LOC, as well as final diphthongs in polysyllabic words, such as macúà sinew, that
are never shortened under any circumstances.","[52, 53]"
"=b. Hucí giwaduc.
hucí hgi-madú-c
wind GI-exist-DECL
The wind has picked upThe status of the compounded noun and verb as a single phonological word is further
confirmed by the placement of the GI- prefix in incorporating stems with a lexicalized meaning,
in which case the prefix always precedes the noun. For example, naadaxiibí to be lazy is an idiom
that literally means ‘to have a wrinkled heart’ (naadá heart + xiibí to be wrinkled). The prefix
hgi-, which in this case has an inchoative meaning, can only be inserted in the initial position
before the whole lexicalized phonological word, as in (284a). If hgi- were prefixed to the verb,
the meaning would become literal and nonsensical, as shown in (284b).

follows the noun. In the case of noun incorporation, however, it is grammatical only before the
noun, as in (285).

The main question raised by possessive incorporation is, what are the grammatical
relations? Does the possessed noun still act as the subject of the verb, or is the possessor
reinterpreted as the syntactic subject (despite still appearing with possessive morphology)? There
are indications that noun incorporation in Hidatsa is undergoing reanalysis. Presumably the (b)
examples in (286)–(288), in which possessive inflection can be replaced by a B-set prefix, the
possessor has been reinterpreted as a subject; but further investigation is needed to figure out
what is going on in cases where the possessive inflection is retained. Finding out more about the
syntactic properties of subjects (e.g., what counts as a subject for purposes of switch reference,
for control-type phenomena in complement clauses, etc.) should help to clarify the status of
grammatical relations.

"Hidatsa verbs describe activities and states, whereas prototypical nouns are referential
and designate physical objects and phenomena. What are perceived as activities and states on the
one hand, and tangible objects and phenomena on the other, is not always predictable on
semantic grounds. There are several formal criteria that help to distinguish nouns from verbs. For
example, nouns, unlike verbs, do not undergo ablaut before the coordinative suffix -g or the
compromisive suffix -aci (see 2.4.1.1). Unlike nouns, verbs have to be nominalized by
prefixation or lexical compounding (see 7.2.3 and 7.2.4) before any determiners can be suffixed
to them. However, no criterion alone applies consistently to all words, as there exists a small
number of nouns, such as áàba leaf, which in isolation (i.e., when not compounded) always
occurs with one of these affixes, as aruˀáàba a leaf of something. In such cases other tests have
to be applied. The case of áàba is disambiguated by attempting to causativize it – a test that
nouns do not yield to, except under exceptional circumstances.
Hidatsa nouns can be divided into non-derived and derived. Non-derived nouns are
monomorphemic roots that synchronically are not analyzable. The overwhelming majority of
nominal roots can occur as words by themselves, but a small number of bound roots and/or
lexical suffixes occur only in complex stems. As no clear distinction can be made between bound
306roots, lexical affixes, and derivational affixes, bound roots and lexical affixes are treated together
with derivational suffixes in this grammar.
There are three types of noun derivation in Hidatsa. The first type is conversion. The
second type is derivation by suffixation and with bound roots. The third type is compounding.
Compounding is an underlyingly syntactic process in Hidatsa. The subcategorization frames are
quite rigid even for derived nouns in Hidatsa. Just as it is not possible to omit a subcategorized
argument of a verb in Hidatsa, in compounds the argument slot for the subject of nominalized
stative and intransitive verbs, and the object or agent of transitive verbs has to be filled either
with a lexical noun or the indefinite prefix maa-. Inalienably possessed nouns subcategorize for
the possessor, and alienably possessed nouns have no arguments. The whole process in recursive
and a derived stem may serve as an argument in a more complex stem.","[329, 330]"
"335Examples of instrumental compounds that are derived from stative bases but may have a
transitive internal structure are given in (95).
(394)
maaˀiidawúá
bell (lit. something with
which one / that rings)
< dawúá ring like a bell
maaˀiixawúá rattle (lit. something with which one / that rattles) < xawúá rattle
Instrumental compounds are sometimes reduced to a single phonological word in casual
speech along with all concomitant phonological processes, such vowel deletion in complex stems
(see 2.4.2) and pitch spreading (see 2.3.1). Examples are in (96).
(395) migháá iibácaadi > mighiibácaadi pitchfork < migháá grass, bácaadi poke sth
migháá iiracgiidí > mighiicgiidí
lawn mower < migháá grass, nacgiidí clip sth
mirába iigigúà > mirábiigigua
beaver trap < mirába beaver, gigúà trap sth
maagarísda iigigawará > maagarísdiigigawara schoolbus < maagarísda child,
gigawará haul sth
The order of indefinite and instrumental prefixes is not fixed in some instrumental
compounds; the specific order depends on semantic scope and the order of derivation. In
example (97), the transitive stem bháàhgee to signal something is preceded by the most
frequently encountered sequence whereby maa- precedes ii-. In example (98), however, the
prefix order is reversed, possibly because bháàhgee was first detransitivized with the indefinite
prefix maa- (maabháàhgee to be signaling) and only then was the instrumental prefix ii- added
to the derived intransitive stem.
(396) maaˀiibháàhgeturn signal < bháàhgee to signal sth(397) iiwaabháàhgeturn signal < maabháàhge to be signaling336Instrumental compounds, just like all Hidatsa compounds, are inherently recursive. The
literal translation of the Hidatsa word for ‘cement’ in (99) is ‘something with which to mix [the
mass] with which one smears the house’.
(398) adí iiˀíbgidi iiˀíhasahemortar, cement < adí house, íbgidi smear sth at sth,
íhasahee mix sth with sth7.3 Proper nouns
Whereas common nouns refer to any member of a class of animate or inanimate beings, proper
nouns refer to uniquely identifiable members of these classes. Prototypical proper nouns include
personal names, place names, and names of any other unique entities. Proper nouns may be
derived from words belonging to any lexical category; they may occur as individual words,
compounds, or phrases. What sets proper names apart from other types of nominals is that, being
uniquely identifiable in most contexts, they usually occur with the definite determiner -s unless
the name is used predicatively or as a vocative. Examples of personal names are seen in (100),
place names in (101), and other types of names in (102).

For the most part, possession in Hidatsa follows the typical Siouan pattern that distinguishes
alienable and inalienable possession. The membership of each class is determined largely on
semantic grounds. Nouns denoting inalienably possessed entities form a closed class of words,
primarily comprising body parts, kinship terms, bodily secretions, and clothing items; in short,
things that the owner cannot be easily dispossessed of. Items that are perceived as being
transferable to other possessors belong to the open class of alienably possessed nouns.
Uniquely for a Siouan language, Hidatsa has developed a third class of nouns whose
membership is based on classificatory possession. Membership in this class is based on semantic
grounds. Only a relatively small number of traditional food products are classificatorily
possessed.
The three types of possession are morphologically marked by distinctive sets of
possessive prefixes, presented in TABLE 8.1 and described in the sections that follow.

2idamadanída-Ø; ima- / m- ; miiní- / n´-; nii-eˀmeˀnéˀ-his, her, its, their

main differences between the three types of possession is given in (1).
(1)Alienable:
madasíìba
Inalienable: miisíìba
Classificatory: meˀsíìbamy intestine (that I am holding in my hand)
my intestine (inside my body)
my intestine / my sausage (that I am eating)339Possessed nouns are inflected for person and number. Person marking by prefixation is
identical for singular and plural forms. Since number marking by suffixation is always
predictable (see plural formation in section 4.2.), only first, second, and third person singular
forms will be presented in the sample paradigms below. However, as possessed nouns inflected
in the plural have three possible readings (plurality of possessor, plurality of possessum, or
plurality of both), an example of a full paradigm is given in TABLE 8.2. The exact reading of the
plural form depends either on real world knowledge or grammatical cues (such as agreement)
elsewhere in the utterance. Oftentimes only one interpretation is possible, the others being
nonsensical or contrived, such as when discussing body parts. Plural marking on the possessed
noun is often not obligatory 83 if plurality is indicated by the context or is simply common sense.

Whereas alienable nouns make up an open class of words that can be enriched by each
and every process of nominal derivation, the only strategy to add novel lexemes to the closed
class of inalienable nouns is morphological compounding. The alienability or inalienability of
the resulting compound is lexically conditioned. If the first element in the compound is an
inalienable noun, as iihsá teeth in (2), then the new lexeme is possessed inalienably as well.
83The exact conditions of obligatory plural marking remain to be determined.","[358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"76More irregularly inflected verbs without any particular order are presented in TABLE 3.8.
The stem initial /n-/ in nuudí to eat sth becomes /w-/ following the first person prefix for no
apparent reason. The citation form and the third person forms of to beat sb in the game occur
only with the prefix hgi- even though the first and second person forms may occur without it.
The vowel in the second person prefix of to stand and to sneeze is long. The first person prefix is
short in to dig sth and to pack sth on the back.

have a special first person plural prefix maa-. The long stem vowel either shortens after the
second person prefix (except in náreec you went), or, according to an alternative analysis, the
second person prefix has an irregular shape nára-. The same process affects the second person
prefix also in a few other verbs that are regular in other respects, as in (8) below.","[99, 100]"
"3The three Hidatsa groups were generally on good terms with each other, but occasional
quarrels did break out, the most severe of which resulted in three-year warfare between the
Awaxa’wi and the Hidatsa proper.
During the smallpox epidemics of the early 1780s, both the Mandan and the Hidatsa
experienced severe population loss. No more than 2,000 Hidatsas, or less than one half of the
pre-epidemic population, survived the calamity. To make matters worse, a tribe of relatively
recent newcomers, the Sioux, who were both numerous and aggressive, started to apply
unbearable pressure on the sedentary village tribes. In order to increase their ability to withstand
the common enemy, the separate Hidatsa and Mandan villages consolidated their strength by
settling together. The Five Villages (Awadigihxú), as they came to be called, comprised three
Hidatsa and two Mandan villages near the mouth of the Knife River at present-day Stanton,
North Dakota.
The close proximity of the three Hidatsa and two Mandan villages offered relative
stability and new venues for communication. Each group tried to maintain its independence as
much as possible, but soon a considerable cultural and linguistic assimilation process was
underway. Already in the early 1830s Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied (2008-12) remarked
that most Mandan were also fluent in Hidatsa (the opposite was not true), and by the 20th
century the two tribes were virtually indistinguishable culturally. As for the three Hidatsa groups,
each one still spoke its distinct dialect. According to Buffalobird Woman, who was born in the
Awadixa village, “the dialects of the three tribes differed somewhat and there is a story that
quarrels sometimes arose through misunderstanding of one another’s language” (Wilson
1913:194). The Hidatsa proper, who were the most numerous, dominated the other two Hidatsa
groups in most aspects of daily life.","[26, 27]"
"17.3.2 Coordinate verb phrases
Coordination of verb phrases is accomplished by suffixing the coordinative marker -g and to
each of the coordinates except for the last one that has a speech-act marker suffixed to it. Verb
phrases, unlike noun phrases, are subject to ablaut before the coordinative suffix. Examples are
in (37) and (38).

liar and the singular form of the demonstrative focus phrase séˀwa that one confirm that there is
only one liar (the agent); therefore the plural -ˀa in miireechááˀac can only denote a plural object.
The plurality of the object in the gloss of miireechááˀac as ‘he is annihilating us’ is further
confirmed by the imperative stem in the sentence that follows, garáàra! run away!, which is
formed with the plural impertive suffix -ara.

The same argument can be made for the sentence in (3), in which the agent hirí this one isin the singular (as opposed to hiróˀ these ones); therefore the plural suffix -ˀo in the relative
clause must be co-indexed with the first person object. In (4), the plurality of the object is
encoded in the mass noun nuxbáàga people, but the number of the agent is ambiguous; there is
no overt agentive noun phrase, therefore niiwááˀac could be translated either as ‘I tell you’ or

The command in (5) is given to a single person, as indicated by the morphologically empty
singular imperative form, and it refers to a single door, as indicated by the root naagí to be sitting
that only refers to singular subjects. The command in (6), on the other hand, clearly refers to
several doors, as indicated by the plural suppletive form gáá of naagí to sit. Since the command
refers to a plural subject, the illocutionary act is marked with the plural form of the imperative
speech-act marker. It is unclear whether a single person or a group is addressed since the plural
imperative suffix -ara is, in any case, obligatory because of the plural grammatical object.

"6.4 Positional verbs
One of the most interesting features of Hidatsa morphology is its innovative system of positional
verbs. Positional verbs and their use as aspectual auxiliaries are common in many language
families. In fact, it is a feature that is found in all Siouan languages, as well as in many other
Plains languages of the area. What makes the Hidatsa system typologically unique is the
combination of position and posture with evidentiality.
Although they describe the posture and position of people, animals, or objects, positional
verbs are even more common in serial verb constructions in the role of auxiliary verbs with
aspectual or evidential overtones. Semantically positional verbs denote posture, position,
existence, and general location. Their primary function, when used lexically, is to describe an
animate or inanimate entity’s ‘posture’; i.e., whether somebody or something is in a sitting,
standing, or lying position, or whether somebody or something is moving around. The second
function of positional verbs is to form existential constructions where the posture of the
described entity, even though understood literally, is of secondary importance. The final function
of positional verbs is to express aspect and evidence when in the role of modal auxiliaries. Even
in the auxiliary modal function the actual posture described by the verbs is still to be literally263interpreted while the focal point of the construction lies in modality. In addition to their literal
meanings and grammatical functions, positional verbs often occur in idiosyncratic collocations.
Although all positional verbs are intransitives that take nominal subjects, they can also be
transitivized through causativization.
Serial constructions of verbs (see 17.5) are exceedingly common in Hidatsa and from a
syntactic point of view positional verbs are in no respect different from other verbs that
participate in such constructions. However, from a semantic perspective, and in light of the
degree of grammaticalization and morphological peculiarities they share, it becomes readily
apparent that they should be treated separately from other verbs and syntactic constructions.
There are two cross-cutting parameters for classifying positional verbs. The first
parameter sorts them into three classes. Verbs belonging to the first class describe literally the
posture of both animate or inanimate entities. They serve in an auxiliary function in
constructions that describe states and activities over which one has no control (e.g., sleeping,
crying). Verbs in the second class are used only in an auxiliary evidential function and describe
the most probable posture of some unseen but audible source of sound. The literal meaning of
verbs belonging to the third class describe the location of animate entities. In an auxiliary
function, verbs in the third class are used in serial constructions for activities over which one has
control (e.g., cooking, whittling).
The second parameter divides positional verbs into verbs of posture and verbs of location.
The majority of positional verbs are unambiguous in their description of posture. However, there
are also two verbs, mahgú and háhgu, that do not specify posture but describe location. Finally,
one verb, nahgú, straddles both categories, describing both posture (sitting) and location.","[286, 287]"

"14.5 Onomatopoeia
Onomatopoetic words imitate or suggest the sounds that they describe. Ideophonic values that
are onomatopoeic are also found in sound symbolism (see 2.5) and reduplication (see 4.10).
However, most onomatopoetic expressions are imitations of natural sounds. Although
onomatopoeias in many languages are grammatical words, their incompatibility with122The transitive verb bóˀsi to bundle sth has an irregular reflexive derivation: the stem-final short i is lowered to ebefore the reflexive suffix -ria.",[486]
"211a few, such as gáàxuga to joke, geebí to gasp, and háchageegi to hiccup, are processes and
activities.
Intransitive verbs that mark the subject with A-set prefixes are called ‘intransitive active
verbs’. Also known simply as ‘intransitive verbs’, in Hidatsa, unlike in some other languages,
they almost never denote qualities or states; instead, they describe activities and processes that
are not directed at an object. Typical intransitive active verbs include diríá to run, gháà to laugh,
and miidí to crawl. The overwhelming majority of intransitive active verbs is characterized by
control over the activity by the participant, but a few, such as húá to cough, déè to die, and
gibsúgi to belch, are not controlled.
Verbs that employ the A-set prefixes to mark the transitive agent and B-set prefixes to
mark the transitive object on a single stem are known as ‘transitive active verbs’, or simply
‘transitive verbs’. All verbs that employ A-set prefixes to indicate core arguments, both transitive
and intransitive, are collectively known as ‘active verbs’.
In TABLE 5.1, the classification of verbs according to active and stative morphology,
presented in columns, is projected onto the transitive and intransitive subcategorization frames in
rows.

"6.1 Speech-act modality
According to the speech act theory first put forward by Austin (1962) and later developed further
by Searle (1969), the speech acts that we produce proceed from the context of the situation in
which they are produced and are therefore pragmatic acts, rather than mere linguistic acts.
Hidatsa is one of those languages that has grammaticalized the implied, or intended meaning, of
every speech act in addition to its literal meaning. Thus, the propositional content of every
utterance (or locutionary act) is always combined with an indicator of the illocutionary force of
that utterance. The illocutionary force of every well-formed Hidatsa utterance (in the simplest
case an independent clause) is indicated by an obligatory matrix clause-final marker.
The main purpose of speech-act markers in Hidatsa is to add illocutionary force to the
locutionary, or literal meaning, of an utterance. The speech-act markers do not alter the
223propositional content of utterances, they merely permit us to draw inferences about the speaker’s
intentions, assumptions, and attitudes. Thus, a simple statement like “he speaks Hidatsa” can be
uttered assertively, emphatically, as an exclamation, or a simple neutral statement without any
attitudinal overtones.
Speech-act markers in Hidatsa can be divided into three categories of unequal size:
statements, commands, and questions. Each category contains a number of grammaticalized
speech acts identified by traditional grammatical labels, such as interrogative, declarative, and
imperative. The feature differentiating minor speech-act types from each other in each of the
three categories is the force of assertion. The statements category comprises the largest number
of grammaticalized speech acts, questions have three, and commands two. As Givón (1984: 318)
has pointed out, the “major well-coded speech-acts [i.e., statements, questions, and commands]
are just the most common, conventionalized (‘grammaticalized’) prototypes”. In reality, the
prototypes are distributed along a continuum space organized along a number of socialpsychological dimensions (Givón 1984: 318).
The three major types of speech acts and their realizations in Hidatsa are listed in TABLE
6.2.

The domain of most illocutionary markers in Hidatsa is a sentence that may be a single
independent clause, or may include relative, adverbial subordinate, or coordinated clauses.
Speech-act suffixes and evidential enclitics (see 6.2) are not necessarily sentence final since
other constituents of the sentence may follow the verb and the illocutionary suffix. Examples (1)
and (2) illustrate variation in word order.

"125Finally, in clauses without an overt subject or object the role of the prefix maa- is
ambiguous. According to the specific pragmatic context it may be interpreted either as the
indefinite marker, if one is speaking about things in general, or as the plural object marker, if
specific multiple objects are referred to. More often than not, however, the reading is indefinite.

"333The overwhelming majority of instrumental compounds are derived from active transitive
verbs. The Object of the transitive verb is indicated by a specific lexical noun, as in (90), or the
indefinite prefix maa-, as in (91). 81 The “instrumentalized” verb subcategorizes for an Object in
the argument slot and the whole compound can be glossed as ‘instrument that one Vs the N with’.

81Interestingly, in Crow the instrumental prefix always precedes the lexical object and the indefinite prefix. Insteadof the Hidatsa N +ii-V and maaˀii-V, Crow incorporates the object and has ii-N-V and ii-waa-V. (c.f., Graczyk

(392) aruˀiirúdaaditriggerInstrumental nouns derived from intransitive active verbs, although not common, are

subcategorize for the Object argument, and the derived word begins with the instrumental prefix.

verb, it fills the Subject slot of the verb. However, since native speakers gloss such compounds
agentively as ‘something with which one Vs’, it appears that the stative verb becomes transitive.
82Whereas instrumental nouns with a specific referent are always syntactic phrases in which each component has itsown pitch pattern, there are a few irregularities to this pattern. For example, the instrumentalized verb stem in
máàˀiibaxisi snow plow forms a single phonological word with the object noun máà snow and is pronounced with the
low pitch to differentiate it from a minimally different indefinite lexeme maaˀiibáxisi shovel.","[356, 357, 358]"

The indefinite object prefix maa- should not be confused with the homophonous thirdperson plural object prefix maa-. Although the two prefixes do not occupy the same slot in the
124affix matrix, they are mutually exclusive in intransitive clauses. The intransitive verb
maaˀirídihee to be haunted subcategorizes for the intransitive subject in (71). If the house in this
example were an agent in a transitive clause it would have to be marked as such with the ergative
suffix -rí.
The same verb, irídihee, is transitive when it occurs without the indefinite prefix and
means to frighten somebody, spook somebody. ‘Your family’ in example (72) functions as a
transitive object of the verb ‘to spook somebody’. The prefix maa- marks third person plural
object in this example.

Finally, the focus morpheme derives interrogative pronouns from D-words that are stativeverbs (see 12.1). D-words that are derived with -wa are used to ask questions about the nonergative arguments S and O. The ergative case marker -rí is suffixed to the same stem instead of wa if the question asked is about the ergative argument A. D-words with -wa may be used
370instead of ergative D-words if the argument structure of the clause is disambiguated by other
means, such as by marking the first or second person transitive object with the B-set pronominal
prefixes on the stem (see 5.1). The derivation of absolutive (S or O) and ergative (A)
interrogative pronouns is given in TABLE 9.1.

Syntactic compounds are lexicalized relative, possessive, and instrumental clauses that may
comprise more than one phonological word. The semantic role of the noun that serves as the
head of the lower clause is subcategorized for by the predicate in the lower clause. In most cases
the lexical head of the relativized clause can be substituted with the indefinite prefix maa-. The
four prefixes that participate in syntactic compound derivation are given in (47).

7.2.4.1 Entitive compounds with agu-/ooThe entitive, or specific, relativizer agu- is used to derive syntactic compounds that are actually
lexicalized relative clauses. Agu- has an allomorph oo- before g-initial stems. The prefix itself is
321a relative clause marker that may also be interpreted as a relative pronoun referring to the
antecedent in the matrix clause (see 17.2.1). As a relativizer, agu- indicates that a specific entity
is referred to (as opposed to partial entities or times/locations referred to by the partitive
relativizer aru-). The basic meaning of an entitive compound can be glossed as ‘X that is sth’, ‘X
that does sth to sth’ or ‘X that sth is done to’.
Relativized stative, intransitive, and existential verbs subcategorize for a Subject in the
argument slot, as in (51), and the subject appears as the initial compounded element. The
compounded subject is coreferential with the relativized constituent and hence with the referent
of the whole compound (‘beetroot’ = ‘turnip that is red’, etc.).

The compounded object is usually not coreferential with the relativized constituent nor the
referent of the whole compound (‘woodpecker’ = ‘Ø that knocks on wood’) although such
compounds do exist (‘candy’ = ‘something sweet (i.e., sugar) that one twists’).

indefinite prefix maa- with the approximate meaning ‘something that is V’. The third item,
322‘criminal’, in (53) is internally complex: the lexicalized relative clause maa-agu-isíà something
that is bad (i.e., crime) is treated as the object of hirí-gsá-s the one who always does.

Many entitive compounds lack the head of the relative clause. The overwhelming
majority of headless relative clauses that begin with agu- and have become lexicalized are
derived from active verbs and refer to the semantic agent. Examples of nouns where agu- can be
glossed as ‘one that Vs’ are given in (54).

casual speech along with all concomitant phonological processes, such vowel deletion in
complex stems (see 2.4.2) and pitch spreading (see 2.3.1). Examples are in (57).

Entitive syntactic compounds are quite often reducible even further by omitting the
relativizer agu- entirely and creating a morphological noun-verb compound, as shown in (58).

Even though syntactic and morphological compounds are to a large extent
interchangeable, it is not always possible to substitute a syntactic compound for a morphological
one, or vice versa. For example, the Hidatsa word for ‘ocean’ in (59) is only acceptable as a
syntactic compound whereas the word for ‘alcohol’ in (60) would literally mean ‘water that is
white’ if it were substituted for a syntactic compound.

spherical (= ‘apple’) that looks hairy’.

3247.2.4.2 Partitive compounds with aru-/ooThe partitive prefix aru-, just like the entitive agu- in 7.2.4.1, is used to derive syntactic
compounds that are actually lexicalized relative clauses (see 17.2.2). Aru- has an allomorph oobefore the liquid consonant r. Aru- has two primary functions in compounds: it indicates (1)
whole-part relationships and (2) locative/temporal relationships. The partitive relationship
should not be confused with the possessive relationship expressed by possessive compounds (see
7.2.4.3).
Compounds consisting of two nouns, the second of which is relativized by aru-, usually
express part-whole relationship, as in (62).

function (as in the examples in (51) above). If agu- is replaced by aru- then the construction has
a partitive meaning; consequently N + aru- Stative Verb constructions can be glossed literally as
‘the adjective part of X’. Examples are in (63).

Relativized active verbs subcategorize for a Subject or Object in the argument slot. Names of the

325V happens to N’. Compounds with the locative meaning in (66) have the literal meaning ‘where

oorigí, literally ‘when the clock is hit’. The literal meaning of the instrumental compound (see
7.2.4.4) mirí iigigísgi clock is ‘an instrument to examine the sun with’.

Relativized stative verbs may also have a locative or temporal meaning, but they are lessfrequent than compounds with active verbs. For example, the place name Garrison in (68), which
literally means ‘place where there are many water snakes’, is derived with the stative verb ahú to
be many.","[343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349]"
"82constructions in combination with the GI- morpheme (see 4.8.). Whereas the productivity of
reflexive constructions is restricted only by semantic constraints, the non-reflexive, or underived,
middle stems form a closed class of verbs.
In addition to reflexive verbs, Hidatsa also uses the middle to mark objects of
postposition.
The Hidatsa middle seems to have counterparts in other Siouan languages. However, it
has never been recognized in any of them and the middle is usually described in terms of
morphologically peculiar intransitive inflection. For example, the received view of the Lakota
ištíŋme to sleep (1P mištíŋme, 2P ništíŋme) is either that of an intransitive active verb, or a
stative verb. The parallel with Hidatsa is striking, since neither language typically marks the third
person, and the shape of pronominal prefixes differs markedly from the regular active and stative
prefixes (3P 0/ , 1P wa-, 2P ya- for active, and 3P 0/ , 1P ma-, 2P ni- for stative verbs in Lakota).
Like in Hidatsa, the Lakota prefixal series of i-/mi-/ni- is also used with postpositions and
reflexives.","[105, 106]"
"209Ergative alignment (see 9.5), which is marked by case marking on noun phrases,
categorizes all intransitive S-arguments like transitive O-arguments of transitive verbs – both are
left unmarked. The A-argument of transitive verbs is specified by suffixation (S=O; A separate).
A common view of morphosyntactic alignment classifies morphologically complex
languages into nominative-accusative, ergative-absolutive, and split-intransitive types. The
separation of the three systems is implied by Pustet in her 2002 article on Lakota and Osage
split-intransitivity, in which she hypothesizes that different subtypes of split-intransitive
languages have a tendency to evolve over time into nominative-accusative or ergative-absolutive
languages (2002).
The coexistence of ergative alignment with split-intransitive alignment in the same
language is a particular type of alignment split that has not been reported in the typological
literature. The presence of both split-intransitivity and ergative case-marking in Hidatsa poses a
challenge to Pustet’s hypothesis. Although the nominative and ergative language types, both of
which are marked on nouns, are clearly in complementary distribution with each other, there is
no reason why the verb-marking split-intransitive system should be incompatible with either one
of the noun-based case-marking systems. In Hidatsa, both the split-intransitive and ergative
alignment types are manifestations of the same underlying principle of transitivity-based coreargument disambiguation that is projected through different value systems onto verbal and
nominal morphology, respectively. Neither system interferes with the other, and both work
toward a common goal.
The discovery of middle verbs in Hidatsa (see 3.3) somewhat complicates the alignment
of verbs in the lines of volition (or agency) and transitivity. Prototypical middle verbs are neither
transitive nor intransitive, but combine the properties of the transitive A and O with the210intransitive S in a single prefix. In addition to the convergence of semantic properties, the C-set
pronominal prefixes, which are used to mark middle verbs, tellingly also combine morphological
elements from both A- and B-set prefixes. On one hand the C-set prefixes mi- and ní- look like the
shortened B-set prefixes mii- and nii-; on the other, the C-set second person prefix ní- is accented
just like the second person A-set prefix ná-. Since the argument structure of middle verbs falls
outside the scope of the traditional notions of transitivity, it will not be discussed further in this
chapter.","[232, 233, 234]"
"54617.6 Switch reference
Graczyk observes that in Crow clauses linked with “-ak are more tightly bound to each other
than clauses linked with -m in several respects” (2007: 406). The properties he lists include no
plural marking before the coordinating suffix and the fact that coordinate clauses have coreferent
subjects. He then takes his analysis a step further and demonstrates that Crow has a switchreference system that marks ‘same subject’ with -ak (Hidatsa -g) and ‘different subject’ with -m
(Hidatsa -wa) (2007: 404).
Boyle (2007: 181-190) reaches the same conclusion about the “older Hidatsa.” He
identifies -g as the ‘same subject’ marker both in the conversational and narrative styles, and -wa
as a ‘different subject’ marker in the conversational style and -rug in the narrative style. As for
temporal and conditional clauses, he identifies -wa as the completed action marker in the
conversational style and -rug in the narrative style, while future action and conditional clauses
are marked with -rug in both styles (Boyle 2007: 182). Boyle then states that the same-subject
marker -g has been reanalyzed by modern speakers so that it is now used to conjoin verbs and
verb phrases even when the subjects of the clauses are different (Boyle 2007: 191). He provides
an example of the modern usage, reproduced below in (134), in which the subjects of the clauses
coordinated with -g are different. According to Boyle’s description, -g has lost its function as a
same-subject marker and is now only a verbal coordinator (Boyle 2007: 191).

Speakers deem vocative forms for woman’s father-in-law and man’s mother-in-law
unacceptable since these affinal relationships require avoidance.
Most of the words in TABLE 8.18 above belong to the morphological class of inalienably
possessed nouns, but a few, repeated in TABLE 8.20, are inflected with alienable possessive
prefixes.

relativeIn general, alienably possessed nouns may freely drop the possessive prefixes and the
remaining nominal stem has a non-possessed meaning. In the case of kinship terms there are two
ways in which words that otherwise seem to follow the pattern of inalienable possession deviate
from this rule. First, the roots *maabísa grandchild and *wácha sibling never occur without
alienable possessive prefixes. Second, four kin terms are formed from ordinary nouns with nonkin senses, but take on special lexicalized kinship meaning when possessed. The meanings of the
basic, unpossessed stems of idawíà his older sister, idaˀaruwíà his wife, idaˀidáàhga his fatherin-law, and idadáàba relative, are, respectively, míà woman, aruwía one who is a woman,
idáàhga old man, and dáàba something. Thus, regardless of their alienable possessive359morphology, all of these words have to be listed as separate lexemes (conventionally under ida-)
in the dictionary.
A few more words (TABLE 8.21.) have been introduced into the kinship system by
analogy with alienably possessed kin terms. For instance, another term for ‘husband’ has been
coined by analogy from macéé man > aruwacéé one who is a man > idaˀaruwacéé her man,
interpreted as her husband. This development is a clear analogy from idaˀaruwíà his wife.
Similar development has yielded idagáàru his old lady, from gáàru old woman, interpreted as his
wife. However, the kinship meaning of these two lexemes in possessed forms is still somewhat
ambiguous and has not become completely lexicalized.

—Kinship terms offer an insight into how alienable possession may become inalienable.
For example, idáàhga old man is possessed in both ways with distinct lexicalized meanings.
Thus, ‘man’s father-in-law’ is a clear example of alienable possession. In ‘woman’s old man’ the
alienable possessive prefix has merged with the stem and the unpossessed form is not possible
anymore, as in TABLE 8.22.

terms may be telling of their order of grammaticalization and their invested meaning in cultural
context. Most important kin terms, such as the terms for parents and children, belong to the class
of unequivocally inalienably possessed nouns.
Finally, the word for ‘husband’ is inflected with active verb prefixes, as demonstrated in
TABLE 8.24, but the word itself is used as a nominal, usually modified with the definite -s or
other nominal modifiers, as in the examples in (25).

Inalienably possessed kinship terms, just like other inalienably possessed nouns, can be
depossessivized by prefixing the indefinite maa- to the third person (or citation) form of the
word. Absolutive forms of kinship terms are used to express abstract concepts or to speak about
kin relations in general. Examples of depossessivized kinship terms are given in (26).

There are two articles, the definite -s and indefinite -wa, and one case marker, the ergative -rí / hirí / -hurí. Unlike Crow (see Graczyk 2007:226), Hidatsa does not distinguish between specific
and nonspecific indefinite articles. The indefinite -wa is specific and the absence of article
indicates nonspecific NPs. The indefinite article has a homophone -wa that is used as a focus
marker. In addition to specifying the definiteness of the noun phrase, articles, along with the
ergative case marker, disambiguate transitive arguments by ranking them on the agentivity scale.
Both articles, the focus marker, and the ergative case marker are suffixed to the noun phrase.
Articles and attributive demonstratives (see 10.2) occur in complementary distribution;
however, the ergative case suffix may follow a demonstrative. The ergative suffix may be
followed by the focus marker.
A single overt core argument may occur as a bare stem, or be marked with either the
indefinite article -wa, definite article -s, ergative case marker -rí, or one of the attributive
demonstratives (see 10.2). The ergative suffix -rí can be combined with any of the articles or
attributive demonstratives. Each of these determiners is described in the sections that follow.","[381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386]"

According to Boyle (2007) and Graczyk (2007), -g marks the connected clauses as havingcoreferential subjects. Although in most cases this characterization is true, it is certainly possible
525to find examples of sentences where the coordinative suffix clearly does not refer to the same
subject, as in (42).

Plural suffixes are incompatible with the coordinative suffix. Grammatical number of thesubject or the object in the coordinated clause is revealed by the plural suffix before the
illocutionary marker or the plural form of the illocutionary marker in the final clause, as in (43).
The grammatical number of the subject in the coordinated clause is disambiguated if a verb has
suppletive forms in the singular and plural, as in (44), or by the use of the collective prefix -aba,
as in (45).

"1.4 Previous scholarship
The earliest historical records of the Hidatsa language include several 19th and early 20th
century wordlists of varying length. The most extensive early vocabularies are those recorded by
Thomas Say (in E. James 1822), Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied (M. Wied, Prinz zu.
81839-41), Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden (1862) and Edward S. Curtis (1907-30, Vol.4).
Lewis Henry Morgan (1871) contains kinship terms.
The first grammar sketch, which includes an extensive vocabulary, was compiled by
Washington Matthews, who served between 1865 and 1872 as a post surgeon in the United
States Army in what is now North Dakota. During his six years in Dakota Territory Matthews
became relatively fluent in Hidatsa. According to James Mooney (1905), Matthews lost all his
manuscript notes and his library when his quarters at Fort Buford burned in 1871. Nevertheless,
he was able to reconstruct from memory his Grammar and Dictionary of the Language of the
Hidatsa, published in 1873. A revised version, entitled Ethnography and Philology of the
Hidatsa Indians, was published in 1877.
In his eleven page grammatical sketch Matthews succeeds in highlighting many of the
essential features of Hidatsa. The grammar is accompanied by a wordlist of almost 3000 entries,
including grammatical particles. Even though Matthews’s transcriptions are often excessively
phonemicized and therefore unreliable, his wordlist contains a number of interesting lexemes and
word forms that have disappeared from contemporary active usage as a consequence of culture
change.
In 1876, a twenty-nine-year old Congregational missionary, Charles Lemon Hall,
arrived at Fort Berthold where he remained until his death in 1940. In order to be more
successful in his activities, Hall resolved to learn all three native languages that were spoken on
the reservation. Without doubt he had most success with Hidatsa. Hall’s published materials
include a thirty-five-page pamphlet containing hymns and Bible passages (Hall 1906b), as well
as a six-page mythological narrative (Hall 1906a) with an interlinear translation. Hall’s most
significant unpublished materials include a manuscript Hidatsa phrasebook (Hall 1882) and an9annotated copy of Matthews’s (1873) dictionary (Hall 1876-90), both preserved at the State
Historical Society of North Dakota.
Between 1905 and 1918, Gilbert Livingston Wilson spent ten seasons on Fort Berthold
documenting Hidatsa culture. Included in the huge number of ethnographic data that he amassed
are valuable lexical terms for material culture and for local fauna and flora. Much of this material
remains unpublished.
Alfred Bowers’s fieldwork in the 1930s and 1960s resulted in a large collection of
Hidatsa texts, many of them sound recorded, all of which remain unanalyzed and unpublished.
In 1911, Robert H. Lowie collected four traditional Hidatsa texts while on a collecting
expedition for the American Museum of Natural History. Those texts were reelicited, transcribed,
and translated by Zellig Harris and Carl F. Voegelin in 1938 and published together with one
additional text that they themselves collected 1939. The published texts, comprising altogether
about 300 sentences, were translated, extensively annotated, and supplemented with
paradigmatic examples and morphological analyses of complex expressions. Although Harris
and Voegelin did not prepare a grammatical sketch of Hidatsa, the generalizations, sample
paradigms, and morphological analyses that they provide in extensive footnotes constitute the
first modern, albeit random and unorganized, description of many aspects of Hidatsa grammar.
As a byproduct, Harris and Voegelin’s fieldwork resulted in an alphabetically organized
lexical slip file containing about 800 inflected themes and several thousand word forms that to
this date remains unpublished.
In the 1950s, Voegelin passed the slip file on to Florence Robinett, who was then
writing a master’s thesis on Hidatsa morphophonology at Indiana University. In 1954, Voegelin
and Robinett co-published a paper on motherese in Hidatsa (Voegelin and Robinett 1954).","[31, 32, 33]"
"Arguments are focused for emphasis. Since the argument structure is encoded by
pronominal affixes in the verb stem, the use of overt pronouns is usually redundant. They are
often used in commands and directives, as in ‘you drive today’, or for suggestions, as in ‘I will
be the driver today’, especially if the person thus singled out is an unexpected candidate for the
task.
Focused arguments are different from contrastive arguments which are formed with ihgii
(see 11.2.3). As the label implies, such arguments are contrasted with each other, as in ‘I will
drive; he will cook, but she will sew’. 92
The focus particle -wa is homophonous with but distinct from the indefinite article -wa.
In addition to the simple fact that the focusing -wa can follow a demonstrative or a personal
pronoun the main argument in support of distinguishing the two morphemes comes from
92The function of focus and contrast markers in Hidatsa if very similar to the use of subject particles -i/-ga andcontrastive particles -eun/-neun in Korean. Although Korean verbs do not mark subject agreement, the use of
pronouns marked with -i/-ga is largely restricted to emphatic constructions. As in Hidatsa, pronouns marked
contrastively are used to mark contrast or the sentence topic.",[392]

"4.2 Grammatical number
Hidatsa marks three grammatical persons, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, that follow four sets of inflectional
patterns. The sets, described in Chapter 3, are reproduced in TABLE 4.1.

iminí-The prefixal inflection mostly marks person (except for plural forms of motion verbs and
third person plural object prefix, described in 5.2); number is marked by a plural suffix. Hidatsa
verbs and pronouns, as well as predicatively used or possessed nouns, are inflected in the
singular and plural. Singular is the unmarked form. Unlike many other Siouan languages,
Hidatsa does not distinguish between inclusive and exclusive forms, and there is no dual.4.2.1 -ˀa and -ˀo ‘plural’
The principles of plural formation with -ˀa and -ˀo are largely identical for nouns and verbs and
the discussion in this section applies equally to both. (The plural pronominal morpheme -roˀ,
which is inserted between the basic pronominal root íì- and the rest of the stem, is described
separately in 11.2.)
The plural suffix -ˀa only occurs with the stem if it is directly followed by any suffixes or
enclitics except the interrogative speech-act marker -ˀ (see 6.1.2.1) and the vocative construction
86(see 14.4). Most types of stem-final syllables are subject to morphophonological change before
the plural suffix (for details on ablaut see section 2.4.1). The following rules apply in plural
formation:
•The vowel in the plural morpheme is deleted if the stem ends with a short a or i. The final
vowel in a few lexically determined noun stems, such as ahí turnip, is not deleted and the
plural suffix is added directly to the unmodified stem, as in ahíˀo turnips. The short u is
not deleted, but in some speakers’ speech the plural form is reduced to a diphthong and a
glottal stop sequence.","[109, 110]"
