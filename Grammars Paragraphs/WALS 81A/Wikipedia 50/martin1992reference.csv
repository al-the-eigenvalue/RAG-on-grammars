"3.2. Parts ofspecch.
ln tlris book all the inflected words are calletl venns. There are, to be sure, many subclasses, but
they share the chlracteristic of being stems that require the attachment of one ottthe int'lectional
endings in order to serve as a free word. The unint'lected wortls divide into two broad categories called
NouNs and PARTICLES. The characteristic of particles, which are typically quite short, is that they
occur as the last member of a eunese, or ari part of a string that can be treatetl as the last member. In
pronunciation they are attached to the last word of the phrase: a noun or a verb tbrm or some other
particle. These charatteristics they share with forms of the copula (i-), a seconrlary subclass of verb.
Typically, particles occur after nouns, but some of them also are attached to verb forms, not only those
forms which often serve as the head of a nominal phrase (as tloes haki 'doing') or an adverbial phrase
(as does hakey 'so as to do') but also tbrms which often stand as the head of a verbal phrase, such as
hay 'does'. Particles that are cAsE M.\RKERs specify va.lences that certain other languages express
through affires or prepositions; coNTExruAL particles (delimiters and partictes of focus) convey
information carried in many other langulges by anicles, adverbs, prosodic elements, or worrl order.
lvfany of the particles originated as bound nouns or verb forms.
The verb ending is considered to be in construction only with its stem. The particle, on rhe other
hand, is taken to be in construction with the entire phrase, which may end in a noun, a verb form, or
one or more prior-attached particles. In a string of particles, the constituents are assumed to peel off
from the right, even when two (such as ey se) form a frequent collocation.",[90]
"If we leave aside the question forms and the particle+olored sentences (such as $e polite -. yo or
the apperceptive -. kwun), the typical sentence ends in a verbal. A sentence is quite complete, and
even quite usual, with nothing but a verb: Ponta 'lSomeonel looks at [something/someone]',
To the verb we can add almost any number ofadverbial phrases with additional informatioo:
Ayki ponta ' ; the baby is involved
Emeni ponta ' ; the mother is involved'.
Cikum ponta
; now is involved'.
Ayki emeni ponta ' ; the baby, the mother are involved'.
Cikum ayki emeni ponta ' -. ; now, the baby, and the mother are involved'.
The orrler in which we add the additional information is determined by the relative importance we
attach to it: the more important, novel intbrmation, the more startling things less likely to be already'-#
'!:*A Reference Grammar of Korean282 p,rnr tknown, come later. All the following sentences are possible:
Cikum emeni ayki ponta.
Cikum ayki emeni ponta.
Enreni cikum ayki pontl.
Ayki cikum emeni ponta.
Enreni ayki cikum ponta.
Ayki emeni cikum ponta.
None of rhem tells you anytbing explicit about who does the looking or who gets looked at, and
only by knowing the meaning of rhe word cikum do you realize that it could not have those roles. The
woids'cikum, ayki, and emeni are simpty adverbial phrases. Only their individual meanings are
helpful in tleciding which two sould be subject and object: under ncrrmal circumstances ponta takes a
personal sutrject and eirher a personal or an impersonal object, so that if kdng 'balt' were to replace
either 'bahy' or 'morher' it wouhl pretty well resolve tbr the hearer the question of subject and objerx
though there woukl still be the outside chance that a whimsical speaker meant 'the ball looks at the
baby' wherher that mpkes strict sense or not. The word cikum is an atlverb of time, un:rble to take the
role of personal subject or object nor of impersonal object, so it does not lead to ambiguity' Both of
the sentences Emeni ayki ponta and Ayki emeni ponta are ambiguous as to subject and object. Or,
rather, they are DIsTNTEREsTED in the subject/object relationship; all sentences are ambiguous in that
they are disinterestetl in some of the possible intbrmation that could be supplied about a situation.
There is, however, a normal expectation about what the speaker or hearer will likely treat as novel
intbrmation; the object is more likely to be the element close to the verb, so that it is a good guess that
Ayki emeni ponta is intended to mean 'The baby looks at the mother' such a good guess, in fact,
111it many spiakers may not be happy with the notion that the other interpretation ('The NlorHER lools--at the baby') is possible.
Both of the sentences Emeni ayki ponta and Ayki emeni pont! are ambiguous not only withrespect to subject and object, tbr the two nouns could be taken as a constiruent, with the first
adnominal to the seconrl, and that could be made explicit by inserting the particle uy alter the t'irst. So
i
there are several possible translations, depending on how each of the sentences is
Ayki (ka) emeni (lul) ponta.
(l) 'The baby looks at the mother'
Emeni (lul) ayki (ka) ponta.
Emeni (ka) ayki (lul) ponta.
(2) 'The mother looks at the baby'
Ayki (lul) emeni fta) pontr.
(3a) 'The mother's baby looks [at it/someonel' Enreni (uy) ayki (ka) ponta.
(3b) 'The baby's mother looks [at it/someone]' Ayki (uy) emeni fta) ponta.
Emeni (uy) ayki (lul) ponta.
(4a) '[Someone] looks at the mother's baby'
Ayki (uy) emeni (lul) pontl.

,ltore details on the use of rhe individual particles will be found in the entries of Part II. Noti!'e
that a phrase with un/nun naturally tends to come toward or at lhe beginning of a sentence because, as
implied earlier, the position fanhest back from the verb is the natural place to put information that is

interest as it buil<ls up to fte uerb. That is in marked contrast with the English sentence, which usually

or adds hedges and
The inglish sp.uf.. g.s his punch in at the beginning, and then relaxes
reservations, oi in4ulges in afterplay. The Korean builds the tension up, then explodes with his verb
and almost immediately subsides.
From what we have said above, it sounds as though Korean has lree word order tbr the arguments
taken bv the predicate, and that is largety true for many common simplex sentences. But certain kinds
of sentjnces iequire the argumenrs to tbllow a certain order, such as those with multiple subjects or
objecrs dat come tiom unrierlying arlnominal (genitive) relationships, as rlescribed in $t0.6. lt""tanin

A ka B to pointa 'A tooks (seems) to be B'
(C ka) A lul B lo yekinta '(C) considers A to be B' (the order of C ka is irrelevant; it can
appear atier A lul or B kD
To this list we can add sentences with the negative copula:
A ka B ka ani 'ta'A is not B'
Notice rhat while B ka A ka sni 'ta 'B is not A' has the same truth value, it is not saying the same
thing, tirr the perspuctivc is ditlcrent.","[277, 278, 279]"
"6.0. Fornu: particles.
Particles are words that mark grammatical relationships, focus, emphasis, attitude, and a variety
of emotional meanings. A Korean particle follows the word or phrasd which it is marking, so that the
Korean particles (like those of Japanese and many other languages) may be called PosTPostrtoNs, by
analogy with the prepositions of western languages, such as English. It is often difficult to translate a
given panicle from one language to another, just as it is diftlcult to translate prepositions, which serve
a similar function in English. The translation of a Korean particle will sometimes be a preposition in
English, but it may instead involve word order or the placement of sentence stress, the choice of
definite or indefinite article, and other subtleties that are ditficult to pinpoint.

dispensation called 'personification"", Kiing i ayki lul ponta 'The ball looks at the baby'. But in our
choice of a particular one of the three nuclear sentence types, we impose much broader constraints
upon the kinds of operations possible, and that is why we need all three types, even though the
predicates oithe second and third type may be regarded as restricted subclasses oithe tirst.
(2) We can EXPAND the sentence. by prethcing the predicate with one or more adverhial phra.ses

marker could be obtained from the kernel sentence Ayki ka ponta 'The baby looks at it', but that
procedure seems both unnatural and unnecessary
(3) We can coNvERT or transfbrm the sentence by applying somewhat interdependent processes:
L status elevation: normal honorific.
2. style shift: plain
formal,
semiformal (authoritative),
familiar,
intimate (including
intimate casual and circumstantial), + polite (including polite casual and circumstantial).
3. tense-aspect shift: present (or timeless)
past,
frtture.
tentative,
retrospective; and
combinations of these.
4. finite-mood shift: statement + question, + command,
proposition, + apperception.
5. voice shift: active + causative,
passive.
6. negation: aftirmative + negative. + strong negative.
7. condensation: sentence
nominalizatiolt, + 3.1no*'nalization,
atlverbialization.
8. quotation: sentence
quoted sentence.
A basic form is postulated tbr each category and labeled above as 'normal, plain. present, statement,
active, atfirmative sentence', to which all three of our nuclear sentences correspond. The other forms
mentioned are considered as produced by some process of derivation from the basic form.
(4) We can transform the ExPANstoNs ofexpanded sentences by means ofthe following processes:
9. switching emphasis (order of the expansions). We are assuming no ""normal' order, but that
may be untenable, since there is usually a least marked version, such as rnrE - pLAcE - suBJEcT -+**+****++** --OBLIQUE OBJECTS . DIRECT OEJECT . VERB.10. subdual offocus (wirh the particle un/nun).

Lorsque ce sens est assez clair par lui-m6me leur emploi est facultatif; on peut les mettre ou

bien souvent dans les livres. On s'exposerait au ridicule si I'on voulait toujours et panout

Not every verb can occur in all the verb constructions we have listed (in $1.5 anA elsewhere); not
every simple verb sentence can take the same adjunct expansions (as tbund in $10.5, $ll.l;; not every
specitication is possible for every expansion. There are various constraints imposed upon the possibli
sentences of the language. Though these are primarily semantic in nature, to some extent they can be
described in terms ofclasses ofverbs, as we have already done in a preliminary sort ofway with such
labels as..'verb : adjective : copula"" and 'transitive : intransitive'; and in terms ofclassei ofnouns,
such as 'animate : inanimate"" and the like. Such classes, while usually labeled with semantic notions
in mind, are made up of members that adhere to certain constraints that can be described as panof the
syntax. This section is an attempt to explore some of these constraints, but it is far from complete, and
much further research is needed.l. Subject-obj ect expansion constraints.
The most obvious constraints are those invotving subjecs specitiecl by the nominative particle
i/ka, direct objects specitierl by ul/lul, and indirect objects specitied by thi personal panicle eykey
(or is more colloquial synonym hanthey) or by rhe impersonal ey.
We will divide the verbs into tlrose which can take no subject, those taking one subject, and those
taking more than one. I have yet to t'ind a verb that cannot, under the proper circumstances, take a
subject. The quasi-processive verbs iss- 'have' and €ps- 'lack' san take two subjects, in the
sense of
nominative-marke<l noun phrases, as crn many (perhaps all) atljectives in the special sense of X
ka y
:Who's
gor a big head?'. The first subject marks
\o -' 'e has a - B', as in Nwu ka meli ka khun ya
the possissor and the second marks the possessed, but a scrambled order is possible: Dleli ka
nwu ka
khun ya 'Just wHo has got a big heltl'l' Such sentences are particularly common with adjectives of

A Reference Grammar of Korean is a description of the language spoken in both nonh and south
Korea in the second half of the 20rh century. This material is given historical perspective by a
description of the structure of the language of the Hankul texts of the second half of the fifteenthcentury and somewhat later, here called Middle Korean (MK); occasional reference is made to still
earlier forms of the language, for which we have only very limited materials in the form of Chinese
characters used for their sound value (i.e. as phonograms) or inferences that ue made from systematic
irregularities in the grammar of the earliest Hankul texts. Anention is paid also to dialect variation
reported for the modern language and errlier speech. The core of the modern material reflects the
pronunciation and usage of speakers who were born in Seoul betbre 1950, but thrt has been updated by
observations of the speech habits of younger speakers, both in Seoul and elsewhere. ln addition to
direct elicitation, tape recordings, anrt written materials, VCR tapes of quite recent Seoul TV programshave provided authentic data of the contemporary usages referred to in various sections of the book.
The sentences are presented in a Romanized form which can be readily converted to a Hankul
representation, but they are intended to write spoken language, and do not dways coincide with theprescribed speltings. The reader should be aware that Romanized forms such as pat.e and iss.ey yo are
not misukes, but represent the relaxed pronunciation of the Seoul speakers who have provided or
checked them, rhough the speakers would indeed themselves write the words with the usually seen
spellings 'pat.a' and 'iss.e yo-, following the pronunciations heard in other areas and increasingly
among younger speakers in
r
Although a good deal is said about the history of sounds and forms, this work does not address
questions of prehistory or genetic relationships. When references are made to Japanese, Chinese, or
English data the intention is usually to show how the Korean counterparts are similar or different, or toseoul.add perspective on the meaning.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

Alrhough in general it is possible to 'scramble"" the phrases that serve as adjuncts to tlre predicate,
so that the object can be emphasized by putting it before the subject, the order ofthe like-mrrked case
phrases (especially objects) is restricted by the semantic relations which allowed the structures to be
tbrmed. The sentence (Ku namca ka) emeni lul pol ul ttrylys;s.tr '(He) hit the mother on the cheek'
cannot easily be said as *(Ku namca ka) pol ul emeni lul ttrylyess.ta though the subject can be
moved to oiher positions: Emeni lul ku namca ka pol ul ttaylyess.ta 'The mother he hit on thd
cheek', Emeni lut pol ul ku nlmca ka ttaytyess.ta 'HE hit the mother on the cheek'. The order of
'mother'and'cheek'is t'ixed even when thematization and focus are applied: emeni nun (ku namca
ka) pol ul tluyly€ss.tn 'As tbr the mother, he hit her on the cheek' but not tpol un (ku namca ka)
emeni lul tttylyqis.ta'As tbr the cheek, it was the mother's that he hit', which could be expressed as
Pol un emeni uy pol/kes ul tttylyess.ts, using an oven genitive structute.

"A word, or a morpheme, somctimes occurs in more thm one shape. The stlAPE is the way the
elcment is represented in phonemes, as actullly pronounced. [n general we tind a resemblance between
the several shapcs of a given element. Except tirr the nrrminative particle i/ka and a few ofthc
intlcctional endings. the different shapes of a given morpheme or word have some stretches ofphonetic
mlkeup in common. The dirtirences in shape betwecn the :rlternlnts of many morphemes and words
cltn be stared in general tcrms; such sratements are ofren ca.lled ttonpuoPHoNElvltc rules. Some of
rhese rules were steted in $:.6; a glurce at thc chart of pcrmi$ed consonant clusters tells us to expect
that r morpheme which sometimes has the shape sip can be erpectetl to show the shape sim (and even
the shape si) in cenain environments. These alternations iue so automatic (every 'expected' -.p before
a nasal turns out to be pronounced -.m) that tbr the most part they are disregarded by the Hankul
spelling and by the Yale Romanization. When we hear the spoken sequence -.mm'. we cannot be sure
m) instead of m + m unless we recognize the
that it will be spelled p + m (or ph + m, ps
morphemes or words involvcd. As a result of convergence, Korean has a fair number of words and
phrases rhat sound the same but are spelled differently because each constituent part is always written
according to its ""basic"" shape, as tirund in some of its other environments. That is why the string
/cimnran/ is written cim mun when it means 'just the burden' but cip man when it means 'just the
house' and ciph man when it means 'just the straw'.
The alternations shown in the cluster table are AUTor\tATtc in that you apply them to shapes
regardless of the particular words involved; and they are FULLY AUToNIATIC because you need not
even know what the grafirmar of the words may be. A similrr kind of fully automatic alternation is
found in English when an expected ""s"" is pronounced /z/ after lgl'. we do not have to know the
grammar to pronounced 'legs"" as llegzl, for the rules of our language automatically keep us from
saying /legs/. Such nrles work for nonsense worcls as well:rs real words: the pseudo-word ""blegs"" can
only be pronounced /blegz/.
Notice that the morphophonemic nrles apply only if the two syllables are run together, with no
pause intervening. In general, that is true for most of our rules for alternations that occur at the point
/ll/ in ku tul ney /kutulley/ 'they',
of contact between Korean morphemes or words. Thus, I n
tal nala /tallala/ 'the moon (as a place)', saynghwal-nan /saynghwallan/ 'the hardships of litb', t0lnol.i /t[lloli/ 'picnic', and other expressions where pause vinually never intervenes. In certain other
expressions, pause is infrequent: kaul nal /kaullal/ 'autumn dayiweatier', onul nal /onullal/.'today'
The expression cal nol.a'plays
compare onul nal(-ssi) /onullnal(ssi)/'torJay the weather
nicely' (adverb + verb) is usually pronounced without pause /callola/. Pause is infrequent between
short unmarked ohject and verb, so tlrat atul nuh,ko ttul nuh.ko 'giving birth to sons and daughters =
(lived) happily cvcr afrer'is usurlly srirl /utullakholttrlhkho/. Wjth a marked object, there are
conmon versions with rrr without pause: ul ul n[ynla 'lays eggs' may he heard as /alullliynta/ or as
/alullnAynta/. Since the accusative particle ends in I and the verb nny-'puts out, ...'takes many
different nouns as object, that verb is ti'equently heard in the alternant shape l5y-. There are also cases
of unmarked subject
verb that are such common expressions they are usually said without an
intervening pause, c.g. pul nunta /pulluntl/ 'a tire brcaks out' (= pul i nlnta). Kyel nanla and kol
nanta, both rneaning 'gets angry' (tiom 'temper appears'), are usually pronounced /.-ll'../ as are their
synonyms kyet niynta and kol niynta ('displays temper'). If a pause is inserted, it would be more
natural to attach the appropriate particle to mark the subject or object: kyel I nanta, kyel ul I
naiyntr. In erpressions of modit'ier
nominal, an intervening pause is usually unnrtural in relaxed
speech, so that tt6.nal nal 'the day to leave' is usually pronouncetl /ttenallal/. We can know the** +-.'.",[101]
"1.10. Alphabetization.

What about the alphabetization of words written in Hankul? There are several different orders in

"5.2.3. Proper nouns: names and titles.
Personal names are ofien of two syllables, and one of the syllables is sometimes used as ageneralion reference, so that brothers may be named Sengen and Cwuen, or Cengkit and Cengmin.
The Chinese chancter tbr the common syllable is called the tollimq ca or hang.lyelq ca. Female
names often take as a second syllable the suffix -huy (a Chinese loan meaning 'princess'), and in rapid
pronunciation -huy sounds like -i, the common hypercoristic sufix that is added only to names ending
in a consonant and is not to be confused with the nominative marker i/ka: Chwunhyang-i fta/luti
'Little Chwunhyang las subject/objectl', Chwunhyang (i/lul) ,Chwunhyang [as subject/objectl',
Ch*unhuy (kai lul)'Chwunhuy [as subject/objectl'. A girl who is called /swuni/ may bear the
straightforward name Swunhuy, incorporating the suffix -huy, but she may write her name with a
spelling variant Swuni; or, she may write it Swun-i. especially when it is a short form for names like
PokrtnGi) or Cengswun(-i). Similar short forms are heard for other names, such as Swuk-i for
Yengswuk-i, Tong-i tbr Poktong-i, .- . Either the family name or the given name may be of one or
two syllables - rarely, even lhree - so that a full name may have as few as two or as many as four
syllables: He wung, Payk rNakcwun, sen.wu wung, ulqci Muntek, He Narselhen. The threesyllable type is the most common in Korea, as it is in China. Civen names of three syllables are
unusual and typically of non-Chinese origin, though the syllables may sound like Chinese elements,
and characters are sometimes assigned to them on a phonetic basis. Korean names are usually said withthe t'amily name tirst, as in Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese. When the personal name has two
syllables, some people like to Romanize it as two words. with or without a hyphen. A man named Kim
Cen.il, for example. may want to write his name as Kim Cen ll or Kim Cen-ll and in English call
himself C.l. Kim. Some Koreans have 'foreign"" names, either in addition to Korean names. or in
place of 6em; the name is often Biblicat. When the family name is Korean it is probably better to write
that first: Kim Phollin (= Pauline), Cen Tawis (= David). If rhe name is that of a foreigner (other
than Chinese or Japanese), it is best to leave the name in the foreign order even in Hankul, and to let'it
revert to the foreign spelling when Romanizing: 'samuel E. Manin- not 'Martin samuel-E."". In
English texts Koreans usually try to tbllow the foreign order. so that the late lYi Sungman is referred
to by the English spelling he preferrerl 'Syngman Rhee"" and the educator Payk rNakcwun writes in
English under the name 'George L. Paik'.",[134]
"-A semantic direct object may be marked by the accusative particle ul/lul,

*transitiveverbs, we will have to recognize;[.i
called psEuDo-rxrneNsirrue verbs (pseudovi)' which function like those intransitive verbs that are seklom, if ever, preceded by
an accusativemrrked phrase. The accusative phrase could still be rreated as an
ohject, but the object is limited to
certain kinds:
(l) a noun showing the destination: hak.kyo lul kanta = hnk.kyo ey kanta .goes to
school,
anends school'.
(2) a noun showing the purpose: kwiikyeng ul kanta
.goes

to see it,;
(3).as.an-.object complement, the substantive form of the
same siem 1or other semanrically and/or
etymologically cognate objects): cam ul cantr
= canta 'sleeps (one's sleep)', chrrum ul chnunlai;r"".=
chwunta'dances (a dance)', ket.um ul kit.nunta

Twu-cip I : l0b; < kichU') 'coughing (a cough)'. But norice rhat kiilim ul
kolinta .draws (a drawing),
paints (a painting)' and cim ul cinta 'bears a burden' are transitive
verbs + tangible objects. There are
also.a_few.cognate subjects: noph.i ka noph.ta'is high (in height)',
kiph.i ia kiptr.ta.is deep (in
ka nelp.ta'is wide (in width)', khi ka [huaa.is tiig'(in bigness)
9:ttl',nelp.i
= is tail 1in stature),,
kil.i ka kilta 'is long (in length)'.
(4) an expression ofduration: sahul ul onta ,comes tbr three
davs'_
(5) an expression of order or number of times: ches-ccay lul kanta ,goes
first,, s6y pen ul kanta
'goes three times'.
(6) a place traversed or a.path traveled: kang ul k€nne kanta 'goes
across the river', kil ul kel.e
kanta 'walks (along) the road', unhayng ul cina kanta .passes the bank,.
(7) a quantified distance traversed: chen-li tul ttwinta ,leaps
a thousanrl leagues'.
(8) an affected part of rhe body: tali lul cdnta .limps (in a ieg)'.
(9) substituting for some other particle in an unuiual p""rrp-hrare:
swul ul chwl hants
_
sr+rl ey
ch*'i hanta 'gets drunk on liquor'. @ut many, I am told, rejeci ul anrl prefer swul ichwi =

Quite a few intransitive verbs take accusatite-marked objeits in speciiized figurative senses, such as
su- 'stand' in aph-cang ut su- 'stand in the van (in the iead)' rnd'K.ki I'susle ya
toyke,vss.nun ya
'lvlust you stand there?' Usually we can say that ul/lul in
these expressiont is""rinrpry substituting for
some other particle, typically ey, or for a larger construction.
A verb is INTRANSITwE if it is never precedetl hv a (semantic) direct ohject: nuc- .be llte,,
c*uk'die', anc- 'sit tlown', iss- 'stay'. Each olihe intransitive verbs falls into
oni of the following classes.
A PRocEssrvE verb lacks the category of plain intticative assenive -ta, replacing it by rhe piocessivo
assenive 'nunta/'nta, except in literary Korean and in set literary phrases
use,Jln thi colloquial. All
transitive verbs are processive, but some of the intransitives are oescntprlve verbs
here called
ADJEcrlvEs (adj). The reference is not so broad as suggested by the corresponding
English category,
which includes not only predicated adjectives but also many attributiv* t.rrni th.t
rr..t..l as nouns-or adnouns in Korean.ir.",[216]
"A Korean sentence can have more thln one.subject hut ordinarily only one direct object, though
there may be more than onc accusative-marketl ntlun when the accusative is used tirr marking
something other thur the direct object and in certain special cases we will describe. Compare Nwu ka
meli ka aph,un ya 'Who has a headache?' (both the sufferer and the body part rre subjects of the
adjective, in somewhat different ways) and Nwu ka meli lul alh.nun ya 'Who is sick in the head?'
(with a transitive verb). Korean is much like Japanese with respect to multiple subjects, but Japanese
seldom permits the kind of multiple accusatives that we t'ind in Korean. Conjoined subjecs or objects
('X antl Y) are, of course, treated as a single constiruent anrl therefore one syntactic suhject or object
in the surtice sentence, which in such cases could be regardetl as derived from a conjoining of two or
more sentences that have the same verb - or as including a stripped-down copular sentence that
packages the multiple nouns before assigning roles.",[280]

unobtrusively the syllable divisions of the original spelling, which varied considerably from text to
text, or even within a single text. The spaces we write represent grammatical information that is not
directly supplied bythe texts, for they recognized graphic syllables and morphemes but no unit between
those chunks and longer strings, such as sentences. Modern writers usually insert spaces that break up
the Hankul text into phrases, basing the boundaries on likely surface junctures - pauses, or momentary
slowdowns in the articulatory process. The main principles followed are to attach parricles at tho end
of the phrase, just like verb endings, and to keep many complex ending structures as unbroken strings.
At the levels of phrase and morpheme alike people vary in deciding just which complex stnrc$res are

of English (""solid, space, or hyphen?') but usually without the benefit of the hyphen.","[260, 261]"

"For a few words, such as those cited on p.41, history has gone awry and confusion is ritb. Some
Koreans treat -.n-n... the same as -..n-l-. and '.1-l-., namely as /ll/, and say Allyeng hasimnikka for
Annycng hasip.nikka'How are you?'. The words kwannyern 'idea'and kdnnan'difficulty'are often
treated as if kwan.lyem /kwallycm/ and k0n.lan /k6llan/, and those spellings are included in some of
the dictionaries, and we have taken account of a few of these by writing such Romanized versions as
kon.rnan. (The word /kw€llyen/ 'cigarene' is usually spelled phonemically, though etymologically it is
kw€n.yen.) Somewhat similar c'ases are kilyern tbr kinyem 'memory, souvenir' and kilung for kinung

represented, and certain shapes are always basically long (like th€, whictr represents a iingle
morpheme). But other shapes are distinctively short or long depending on the morpheme. The lo-ng
vowel in these shapes usually crtrrcsponds to the Midtlle Chinese'rising"" antl ""t'alling"" tones,
bui
there are many exceptions. Parentheses enclose mlrginal or special shapes.
Although there are characters that are to be read with the syllables cum, cwul, nin, nwal, nyek,
nyep, and phik, they are not used in loanwords found in modern Korern, so those have been feft Uiank
in the table. There are no characters rearl with the syllables c*ang, hi (as <.listinct from huy), kut, kya,
mam' non' nyak, nyang, n-vey, op, phyu, or pik; these, too, are blank in the table. Among the filied
slots in the table, several shapes appear in rrnly a few loanwords and some of the n... shapes tlo not
appear in environments critical tbr decitling the initial. For kh... rhe only shape is khway.

ttg shapes kkik. ssang. and ssi are anomalous in beginning with reinfbrced consonants, but theNorth Koreans standardize kkik 'ingest' as kik, and ssi was spellecl si in earlier times. The rearling
ssang 'pair' first appeared in 1677, but the reading ssi 'clan' seems to be fairly new, anrl is probabl!

To write most words of the Chinese vocabulary the Koreans have traditionally used Chinese
eharacters, called IItrnqcrr or lliinnrunr;-ca. Frlr eirch syllable oI a Chinese word there is an
appropriate trarlitional character. so that knowing the characters is olien .r help in tinding out what
twomorphemes make up the word. The bulk of the Chinese vocabulary consists of binoms
morpheme (hence two-syllable) words. You can suspect that you are helring a Chinese word, and
accordingly that the word can be written in Chinese characters, whenever you hear a word that consists
ofany two syllables listed in the shape-type tahle. Sometimes, ofcourse. y()u mry be wrong, especially
if one of the syllahles (such as ka or sa) is of a very comm()n typc anyway. Vru would be mistaken to
think that salang 'love' should bc writtcn with Chinese characters. Antl sayngknk 'thinking', despite
its detinitely Chincsey t'lavor (antl perhaps even :r Chinese etynrology), is n(tt written with characters.
The Chinese characters are listetl in dictionaries, and the dictionaries are usually organized
according to a somewhat arbitrary system tiat analyzes the structure of each character so iui to find a
'radical"", traditionally the element that gives the character its category ofmeaning, and a residual part
that is often called the'phonetic"" because it hints at the pronunciation. The 214 Radicals are ordered
according to the number of strokes originally made in writing them (some are now writlen with fewer
strokes than the order implies), and each of the charrctcrs is listed accortling to its Radical number +
the number of residual strokes. For example, the chrmcter {E .ny 'plum' is listed unrler Radical 75
(the Tree or Wood Radical), in the subgroup of characters that have a residual-stroke count of 7, so
that we can designate its general location as '75.7"". The radical, as so often. is on the left and by iuelf
is a character that means 'tree'. The part on the right is the phonetic; by itself it is the character may
which is listed under Radical 80, while the bottom part of that character by itself is mo
'eue.y'
'mother' El. It sometimes happens that a character has a residual-stroke count of zero; that is, the
character is a radical itself, like
mok 'tree' 75.0. When there are several characters with the same
residual-stroke count, the order is usually determined by an arbitrary tradition that follows'earlier
tlictionaries. Most Korean dictionaries of Chinese characters also have an indei by ""totd stroke
count-, which is useful if the radical is not readily ascertainable, and an index by Korean readings
arranged according to the Hankul alphabet, with the order under each reading determined either by the
rrdical or by the total stroke count. A list of the names by which Koreans call the 21,$ Radicals will be
tound in Appentlix 5. (Some of the names, like the radicals they represent, are rare.)
When we look up a character in a Chinese character dictionary, called lliinqca sacen or (after the
name of a dictionary famous in ancient China) okphyen 'Jewel Book"", we are given only scanty
information, usually just a Korean 'reference tag"" which tells us the appropriate pronunciation and
something of the meaning. lf there are several meanings or readings, each is given, usually following
the traditional entries of large Chinese dictionaries, so that the information is often archaic and not
always relevant to real loanwords that are used in Korean today. The typical form of a reference tag
fbr a noun is the Korean translation (as a noun or noun phrase) + the reading: A siilam in 'the in that
means silam 'man"". Tbe reference tag for a verb tlpically gives the Korern translation in the form of
a prospective modifier (or a phrase that ends in one)
the reading: -H, polq kyen 'the kyen that
means pol 'to see'', The prospective modifier is also used tbr the adjectives, but a few of the
adjectives are tagged with the simple modifier, to differentiate them from processive use of the same
l,hun tay (1576 rYuhap 2:47b) vs khulq tly

€-I 1.3. Style conversions.
Koreans speak in diftirent sryLEs dcpending on the person with whom they are talking. The style
chosen shows something ahout the social rapport which the speaker t'eels to exist between himself and
the person he is addressing. The stylization of a sentence dittbrs, of course, ttom the insenion of the
honoritic marker -usi-/-si-, in thlt the verbs containing the honoritic show a special detbrence toward
the suBJEcT of the verb tbrm, and that subject may or may not be the same as thc person to whom one
is speaking. Honorit'ic t'urms occur in eLu styles of speech. lf you are talking to a chikl about his
teacher, you might use thc eLAIN style, but a! the same time insert the honorit'ic marker tirr each verbwhich has the teacher tbr a subject.
Euch style is mlrketl hy the choice olthe tjnal verh expression in the sentence. Each ofour threc
scntcncc typris can bc altcrcd tiorrr the hasic, pllin-stylc tirrms by doing something to the inflccted
word (Ponta; Coh.ta; -.itr). Thc possible sentence-t-rnal typcs are realized through the finite-moodA Reference Grammar of Kottan300 p,rnt Ishi6s of $l 1.5, where all of the shapes are presented. The full range possible tirr kinds of ending

with the panicle ka is awkward (ungrammatical?); it is also ditficult (impossihle?) for the intransitive
cinta 'is defeated, loses', sala cinta 'vanishes', and swtm (i) cinta 'breath expires = dies'.
(4) The intransitive verbs cwuk- 'die' (Cwukci ka/lul anh.nunta 'He just won't die!'), phi- 'bloom'
in kkoch i phi- 'flowers bloom', tulli- in kimki ey tullinta 'catches a cold'; and perhaps a few others.
(5) Periphrastic passives ($11.6) with VN (+ ul) + tang hantr are slightly awkward with ka as preemphasis, but apprrently not ungrammrtical. Those with pat-, on $e other hand, are all rejected.ln interesting contrast with the behavior of adjectives and of the other verbs, most of the
processive verbs that allow either ka or lul tbr preemphasis cannot have the mOs hanta form, even
without pre-emphasis. There is no *mek.hici (lul/ka) mds hanta'can't/won't get eaten', *kakey
toyci (lul/ka) mds hanta'can't/won't get to go', ... . But we can do this: nrrls kanta'can't/won't go'
+ mds kakey toynta'gets so one can't/won't go'+ mds kakey toyci lul/ka anh.nunta'doesn'tget
so one can't/won't co'. And poici (lul/ka) mds hrnta occurs, but only as the causative'can't show',
not as the passive 'can't get seen'; the passive and causative stems derived from p(F'see'converge in

"3.3. Free and bound words.
The borderline between't'ree"" and ""bound'tbrms is not always easy to delineate antl many
decisions have to be somewhat arbitrary, but I try to be as consistent as possible. Every word is tb
some extent 'bound' in that there are constraints upon its occurrence: '..ts' .rn take as its object
'rice' but not 'his high-jumping' though 'likes' can take both phrases as objects. But some words are
much more severely bound than others, so that it is easier to list their constraints in general terms. In
this book I speak of FREE and QUAsI-FREE nouns, of FREE and BouND verbs. I also speak of certain
words as being seren,uLE or INsEPARAoLE, meaning that elements (such as particles) either can orcannot be inserted between those words and the other words with which they are typically in
construction. Another kind of word category is that of the BouND NouNs, nouns that are restricted in
construction to limited sets of partners. The bound 1'prenoun"" =) arlnoun approaches the status of a
noun prefix, the bound 'postnoun' approaches that of a noun suffix. Tlre bounrl ""preverb' approaches
the status of a verb prefix or an adverb, the bound 'postverb"" approaches that of a verb suffix.
Ultimately perhaps all noun pretixes should be called 'bound atlnouns' and all noun suftlxes should be
called'bound postnouns"", but I have matle a division, basetl on the relative range ofoccurrence with
different sets of nouns.
ln the same sort of way, it might be said that those particles which appear only after nominals
approach the noun subcategory of'postnouns' and tlose which appear only aiier verbals approach the
category of verb endings. The difference lies in the constituency of the phrases: I consider that the
particle always stands in construction with the entire remainder of the phrase.",[90]

On the subtleties of reference, see Lukoff 1978. On multiple subjects, see $10.6.
Since the purpose of the honoritic marker is to elevate the status of the subject, that phrase must
be personal and other than the first person. You never use honorific forms of yourself. There is one n!1l
type of exception to the requirement for a personal subject: 'it rains (snows)' is otien said as pi ka rae
(nw0n i) osinta or pi ka (nw0n i) naylisinta. But no other statements of weather phenomena ars
llr:
treated as intrinsically detbrential, and some speakers reject nwtn 'snow'.
Some verbs are commonly rephced by euphemisms in place of the expected regular honorific .ilsij
lirrnutions: capswusi- (abbrevilted otlen to capswus-) or ciisi- < ""c(w)asi- is used tbr (*)mek.usi'deign to elt', cwumusi- tbr rcasi-'deign to sleep', tol,a k:rsi-'deign to go back'tbr (*)cwuk.usi'[an honored person] dies' (but wuli lul wi hay cwuk.usin YEyswu nim 'Jesus who died tbr us'). For
the honoritic tbrms of the stem iss- (strictly speaking the three homonymous stems meaning'be',
'stay', and'have') see the discussion under suppletive negarives ($11.7.3). The euphemistic
+replacements are much like simple nonhonorific stems in freely entering into larger structures, tbr tley
's
are not subject to the combinatorial restrictions of -usi-.
,gg:
In complex conversions involving more than one verb, it is often possible to pur thc honorific rfr1

On the acceptatrility of marking as honoritic a verb with an auxiliary, see the chan in $7.5 (p. 226).
An obsolete variant of the honorit-rc marker has the shrpes -usiop/-siop (also -usinp'/-siap)
bclirre one-shape endings antl the shapes -usir/-sio (also -usia-/-sia-l) betirre two-shape endings.
The obsolete inrperative ending -usiopsose/-siopsuse, as in the tornr cwusirtpsose'pleuie give us'used
:rn obsolcte entling -sose, which sometimes drops and
in prlyers, consists of this element -sioplelves just cwusiop (also orr.rsilp).
Parallel to the honoritic marker there is an obsolete element with the shape -sa(o)w-/-ow-, whichfis,lescribed by Korean gramrnarians as'humble"", but since the humility olten seems to retbr to the
objecr or indirect object rather than the subject (Ak ey se kwu haopsose 'Deliver us trom evil') it can
be equivalent in tbrce to the honorit-rc. On the other hand, a derived version -caow- (abbreviation
-urw-) or -caow-/-cao., usually attached only to stems that end in t c ch nc, seems to have only the
meaning'l/we humbly do': Tut.caopkentay... or Tut.cao(\vu)ni ...'From what has reached myhumble ears, ... ', IUut.caopkenlay ... or Mut.cao(wu)ni ... 'Nlay I venture to ask .- '. This tqr is
obsolete. About the only modern humble stem is p6yw- 'I have the honor of seeing', and we might say
that this verb is the converse of posi- 'deign to look at' in that it elevates the status of the oBJEcT
(explicit or implied) rather than the suBJEcr: Tto poypkeyss.sup,nikka 'l'll be (having the honor of)
and'you', ofcourse, are worthy ofdct'erence.
seeing you again'
'fhere are other dcvices to cxalt thc status of phrases in the expansion of the nuclear sentence. The
indirect object can be exalted by using the honorif-rc panicle kkey 'to someone esteemed' in place of
eykey or its synonyms such as hrnthey, and to say 'tiom someone esteemed' you replace eykey se
with kkey se. One way of exalting a personal subject is to turn ii into an indirect subject with the
particle sequence ey se 'tiom; at'
:rs in h6ysa ey se cwunt! 'the company gives it', the usual way to
but replacing the indirectobject particle ey with ia honoritic tbrm kkey,
srate an impersonal subject
as in sensayng nim kkey se cwusip.nita 'you tleign to give it'. Another way to make any personal title
honoritic is to add the postnoun ninr, as in sensayng nim 'the esteemed teacher/maestro/gentleman'
(onen 'you, sir'), paksa nirn 'the esteemed Doctor', samo nim 'ivtadam', Kim sensayng nim 'the
esreemed lvlr Kim', Kirn sensayng (nim) samo nim 'lvfarlame Kim, lvlrs Kim'. The postnoun is also
apeci 'father', eme' nim
userl with kin terms, br)th male and t'emale: ape' nim 'honoretl thther'
'honorett mother'
atul 'son', tta' nim 'esteemed
emeni 'mother', atut nim 'esteemed son'
daughter'
ttal 'daughter', hyeng nim 'esteemed eldcr brother' hyeng'elder brother' (also 'you'
in a letter m a male colleague of any age). There are both honorit'ic and humble terms for kinship
roles. In general, the honoritic version is used in addressing one's own elder kin and in speaking of
someone else's kin ofany age. Younger kin are usually addressed by name or nickname. In speaking of
one's own kin, less honoritic tbrms are in order, but honorifics are olien heard even so, perhaps as a
ciuryover t'rom chiltlhood inculcation, especially with reference lo grandparents and parents.","[294, 295]"

my own, however humble it might be'.
The unusual structures of (3) and (7) above mark both the noun and the numeral(-counter) phrase
with the nominative particle. The accusative particle, too, permils such strucrures (chayk ul hana lul
pwas.s.ta) but they are not usually compatible with other panicles. such as that marking the indirect
object: *chinkwu eykey twtil eykey cwuess.ta
chinkwu twtl eykey (or twii chinkwu eykey)
cwucss.ta 'gave it to two tiiends'. But when the dative phrase is optionally marked by the accusative
particle (ul / Iul) instead of the dative panicle (eykey or hanthey) rhe structures are acceptable. at least
to some speakers: Emeni ka ai tul ul motwu lul s€nmul ul c*uess.tr 'The mother gave a present to
each of the children' (LR 24:174:n6). There are advantages to 'copying"" the nominative or acuusative
marker inslead ol letting the quantitier stand as an adverb, in that the reference of the adverbialized
number could be either to the subject or to the object, so that (as Gerdts 1985 points out) A ka B
eykey C lul s€ys cwu€ss.ta is ambigu<lus as to whether three of the A or three of the C are involved,
whereas A ka B eykey C lul s€ys ul cwuess.ta is unambiguously'A gave three ofC to B'and A ka B
eykey C lul s€ys i cwuess.ta is unambiguously'Three ofA gave C to B'.
Numbers (whether numeral + counter or just numeral) are allowed to ""tloat"" away from the
nouns they are counting when those nouns are suhjects or direct objects. The float is normally not
permitted ifthe noun has some other role in the sentence, unless that role is secondary to an underlling
role as suhject or object, as in the c:rusative structure of Nny ka hlksayng eykej scys lte.nakey
hayss.ta 'l let three of the students lelve'
ltukslyng i sEys (i) tlena.ss.la 'Three of tie sturJents
leti'. A special case is found in Nay ka hakslyng eykey sGys i ttr'nukey hayss.t:l 'I let the students
leave in groups ofthree (or as a group ofthree)', where the nominative-markerl quantifier is allowed to
float although the underlying subject to which it refers has been converted from nominative to dative
(haksayng
haksayng eykey) under the causativization. We know that this is the nominativemarked quantifier (and not, say, a variant of stsi 'three persons') because the suppletive alternant of
the marker appears in Nay ka haksayng eykey yel hana ka ttenakey hayss,ta'I let the students leave
in groups of eleven (or as a group of eleven)'. The underlying strucrure secms to be something like:
let the students do it such that three [of theml leave"". ln a simpler sentence without the causativization
yttu might get haksayng i s€ys ... or hlksayng ul sOys ul ... 'three of the students [as subject or
objectl'. Perhaps these are just cases of kintl of pscutlo-tloat using the multiple-case marking that is
permitted for genitives, from an underlying structure *haksayng uy s€ys 'three of the srudents', but
that explanation seems disconfirmed by the fact that, unlike Japanese, Korean does not permit the
structure *N uy Num. (CrTsukamoto 1986. I find no examples of .N r Num in earlier Korean.)
The floating of the numbers is usually called 'quantitier float'. since in other languages (such as
Japanese) there are quantifiers like 'all' and 'lots' that can behave the same way as the number words.
It should be noted that Korean tjl 'all' and mf,nhi 'much/many' ar. advg1tr5, unlike the number words,
so that they will occur only in structure (l) as N pcl li/miinh.i 'N entirely/muchly'. and only that
structure is theretbre tbund for them in earlier Korean, too. Exceptirrnally the adverb motrrt'all; each,
every' is also now (and perhaps newly) treated as a noun that can trke the nominative and accusative
markers. To say'all N'or'many/much N'you use the corresponding adnominal forms mritun and
minh.un. The word meych myech 'how many; a tbw', is a numeral. and like the other numerals it
can stand as subject or object. The most frequent occurrence is betbre a noun or a counter: meych
tal(q tong-an)'how many months (time)', meych salam/pun ina'about how many people', meych
pen 'how many times'. But it can also occur alone without a counter: Swu ka meych ina toysinun ci
yo 'lvlay I know your age?' And, with or without the counter. it can occur in the various stmctures
open to the numerals: Thokki meych (nrali) eykey punpay han s€1'm in ya 'How many rabbits do you
tiguie got their rations?'; Son nim meych pun i osip.nikka 'How mlny glests are expected?'; Chayk--i-'Ii(lA Reference Grammar of Korean174 penr rmeych kw€n ul ilk.ess.ta 'l read a t'ew books'; Ku ttohy lul meych kly te sir 'tit cwuo 'Buy a few
moie of that size'; Ko ttolay meych i chac.e wass.ess.ta 'A group (of boys) of thirt age had been here
to call'.
Once the quantitier is t'loatect as an adverbial it has rhc tieedom of other movable adverbs and may
move away t'rom the noun ro which it retbrs. According to Gerdts (1985:55) Ku cik.kong i sonq-kalak
i kikyey ey sEys i callyess.ta can be taken either as 'Three tingers of the workman were cut on [cut off
byl the machine' or'The tingers ot thrce workers wcrc cut on [cut otTbyl the machine'.
Although the plurll panicle tul can tieely occur aner just about irny phrase, anrl can be insened
repelredly to increse the emphasis, it is not quite the samc as qumtit'ier float, because the ret'erence is
onty rc rt"" subject, an{ that may be implied rather than expressed. Notice that (lvuli kt) chayk tul

should be noted that the relationship between the two nouns in N1 i/ka N2 i/ka -'is more narrowly
defined than that of the nouns in N1 uy N2 with rle adnominal particle, which neutralizes all sorts of

the other moods
Because of the complexities of form taken in the various styles ($11.3), I have prepared a table to
display the forms used for each category and it includes also the retrospective forms ($l 1.4) because of
their interrelated complexities. In the tahle an arrow pointing up means ""use the simple statement
form, perhaps with a different intonation"". An arrow pointing to the left means 'use a form from a less
polite style"", one pointing to the right means 'use a form from a more polite style"". An arrow pointing
both lett antl right means'use either a less or a more polite style"". The difference between the styles is
not entirely a gradation ofpoliteness as such. to be sure, but tbr the purposes ofthis table we will so
consider it. Some categories offer several possibilities, for which there is generally a slight difference
in usage; the options are cited here in the order of the relative frequency with which they are chosen.
The table on p. 306 summarizes the facts that are discussed in detail, style by style, in later sections. In
the table Okwun represents also G)kwumen and kulye represents also kwulye.
There are several colloquial and dialect forms that do not appear in the table, such as -(su)pci yo,
'(u)psey, -la kwu, -ca kut, ... . They will be found as individual entries in Part lI.",[301]

"0.4. Grammatical terms.
You may find the terminology unfamiliar and irksome. lf so, think of the categories in terms of
concrete representations. Should you not tbel comfortable referring to a common form of the verb as
the'gerund-, take that jusr ro mean ""rhe -ko tbrm"" of that verb or, if you prefer, 'the hako form"".
The grammatical categories ot Korean are numerous, diverse, and complexly represented. They cannot
easily be put into a tiame ofreference based on the descriptions ofother languages. But in practice it is
convenient to choose terms thar are sonrewhat t'amiliar, supplemented when necessary by new terms
mrde up by analogy, with the clear understanding that No DIRECT coRREspoNDENcE is intended with
the categories ofother langurges that are given similar names.
The set of names found in this book has grown out of terms used in earlier books; many of them
stem from Elinor Clark Horne antl our teacher Bernard Bloch. One that has troubled many people is
'infinitive"" for the -e ending. Reg;rrdless of the merits of the word itselt, tlre name has become so
widespread in discussions of the grammar of Japanese (where it refers to the -i form, sometimes called
'continuative stem""; that it has surely become the standard. For what is here called the 'summative' I
earlier applied Horne's term 'nominrtive"", but that is bener used in ret'erence to rhe case-marking
function ofthe particle -.i/k:r, and so I have abandoned its use tbr any other purpose. The word
'substantive"" is sometimes used as r general term tbr ""noun"", but here it is narrowed in det'inition to
one of the endings (-unr) thct make the verb inn a tirrrn thlt is used like a noun; orher such forms are
the summative -ki and the 'derivetl noun"" -i. For the -key ending I have changed t}e earlier term
'adverbial"" to 'adverbative"" so that 'adverbial"" can be used to discuss syntacric phenomena only. I
adopt Wagner's term 'purposive"" to retbr to the -ute ending, but what he calls the ""expository"" is here
called the 'sequential"" (the -uni entting), and what he called the'eftbctive' is called the'projective'
(the -tolok ending), so that fre term 'eft'ective' can dcsignate an aspect marker of lUiddle Korean
(:ke,b- or -'eh-). ln speaking of sentence styles I continue to use 'authoritative"" to refer to verb forms
ending in -o/-so (etc.), as a synonym tbr'semitbrmal"", u'lgner's term, which characterizes the style
in broader way.",[13]

"10.0. Constructions.
The words of Korean enter into a variety of constructions which form phrases that serve ds
constiluents of sentences. Below we discuss the problem of dividing a phrase into words, to begin
with, and then describe the formation of sentences in terms of predicates and adjuncts, witb
observations on t'eatures that constrain the acceptable combinations of syntactic components.
I10.1. Problenr of word division.
One of t\e most perplexing of the basic problems in describing Korean syntax is that of deciding
whether a given stretch of morphemes is one word or a phrase of several words. For sone llnguages
such decisions can largely be bxed on phonological cues: is there a pause, or could there be a pause?
In Korean that is not thc most useful criterion, for adjacent elements are apt to stick to each other even
if they are not closely tied grammatically. tnstead, we base our decisions on t'reedom oi combination.
Can the individual elements occur in other and widely varying environments? Is the unit, though
restricterl in occurrence, grammatically parallel to similar units that occur more widely? h is this
relative freedom of combination drat enables us to decide the phrase stnrcture of sentences. Typically,
a free word is always an immediate constituent of some larger sequence. No ""IC cuts"" sepcrate some
part of the worrl and put it with an adjacent
Ielement.",[270]

"0.3. Orientation.
This book is not trying to prove a theory about the nature of language. I do not maintain that the
structure of a language is either discoverable or describ;rble in one and only one 'correct"", or even
uniquely 'best"", way. The critcria tbr judging a description vary with the purpose for which it is
intended. For a retbrence grammar the most imponant criterion is balanced completeness. As much
useful intbrmrtion as possible must be given in a tbrm that mrkes it readily accessible to the user. The
intbrmltion thrt is most often, or m()st s()rely, needed shoukl be the euiest to get at. Lists are not to
be scornerl; tbrmulm are not to he worshipped. Econorny of stltcnrent is a technical criterion relevant
to the accessibility ofthe informltion; elegance ofstrtement is a psychological criterion relevant to the
impact of the infbrmation.
Just whlt intbrmation is useful and for whom? The foreigner who is decoding (making out the
meaning of) messages spoken or written in Korean is concerned, first of all, with the coNsTtTUENcy
of senlences. Given a sentence, he wants to know what are its pieces and how do they fit together. He
needs to be able to take the sentence apart, to 'parse"" it. The foreigner who is encotling (making up)
messagcs in Korean is interested in the tteNtpuLertorv of sentences. Given known sentences, what
new but related sentences can he say that will be understood and accepted by Korearu? Up to the
sentence level our presentation is in terms of item and arrangement: the items are morphemes (words
or parts of worrls), and the arrangement is statetl in terms of immediate constituents 0C's) or, in a few
cases, unordered strings. Beyond the sentence level, the presentation is in terms of item and process:
the items are certain types of simplex sentences, and the processes are coNvERstoNs that turn these
into more complex structures.",[13]

"Koreans usullly write in an alphlbct known as Hankul. As l result, the wortl Hankul is also used
to mean 'Korean, langulge, especirlly as written' and 'Korean letters = literature'. ln the system of
writing there are symbols to represent each of the phonemes of Korean. The term 'Hankul"" was first
used by Cwu Sikyeng in l9l0; earlier the symbols were called Cnmun. Ir is possible to use the sysrem
as we use Roman letters, writing horizontally a$oss the line letter by lener: that is called kalo.ssuki'horizontal writing'. But usurlly the symbols are joined into written syllables, which often but not
always correspond to spoken syllables. The written syllables are made up of an 'initial"" consonant
(including zero) + a vowel nucleus or 'medial"", consisting of a vowel or a semivowel (y or w)
a
vowel, written as a unit. The vowel is sometimes fbllowed by a'tinal"" consonant or two-consonant
cluster that is called by the Korean grammarians pat.chim 'pedestal'. The syllables are written as
*logotypes""
blocks (called
by 1893 Scott) designed ro resemble the shape anrl spacing of Chinese
characters, which are still otlen used to write, or to clarity, Chinese words in the midst of native
Korean words. The initial is wrincn at the top, the nucleus either on the right (those containing a or e
or i) or below (those containing u or wu or o). A tinal pat.chinr is placed below everything and
slightly to the right, if it is but a single consonant. The shapcs of the symbols are altererl a bit when
they appear in different positions. For example, betbre a the k swoops back to the Ieft 7F ka, but
astride the o it has a straighter fall lr'! ko, and the t'inal k is longer, tlatter, and straighter: si mak.

consistent, the Roman transcription can be automatically converted into the Hankul version ancl vice

ditl'iculties and specinl rules. The system used in this book takes time to ge! used to, because it is*-A Reference Grammlr of KoreanPARTI 7tlesigned to be typographically simple by avoiding 'odd"" leuers, such as 6 (= e) and (= u). Bur

How many dift'erent syllables does Korean have? For the modern language, computer codes allow
about 2,500 Hankul syllables to be differentiated. Using all conceivable sequences, including many that
do not occur in any word, rYu Huy (1824 Enmun-ci l8) came up with rhe staggering number of 10,250

Koreans, like speakers ofEnglish, have spelling problems. Although the Hrnkul system ofwriting
is very simple, it is not easy to devise a consistent systenr tbr spelling out the words ofthe language.
That is because the structure of Korean is somewhat complicrted, in drat words and parts of words
often change the way they sound depending on the words around them. The Korean writer has a
choice: he can use the Hankul symbols (or their Roman equivalents) to write phrases rxrctuy es
THEY souND, or he can write individual words and parts of words ALwAYs THE sAME wAy regardless
of changes in sound. The first method, known as a PHoNEMtc orthography, has the advantage that
even a foreigner beginning his srudy of Korean can read sentences without learning a lot of special
rules; and he can write down everything he hears - provided he hears accurately - without worrying
about what words the phrases contain. But the disadvantage to the reader who already knows the
language is obvious: the same word appears sometimes in one shape, sometimes in another. For that
reason, native speakers of Korean naturally pretbr some son of ltonpHopHoNEMtc onhography, u
linguisa call the second kind of spelling. Morphophonemic spelling tells the reader a lot about the
gramrnar of the phrase he is reading, since it tries to spell each word (or pan of a word) always in the
same b:sic shape, with the expectation that dre reader will be able to apply a set of rules that willautomatically produce the particular phonemic shape needed to pronounce the phrase, We do somethingsimilar in English when we write our plural ending as 's"" both ater 'cat"", where it is pronounced as
an s, and after-dog"", whereit is pronounced as a z.","[16, 17]"
"6.5. Particle sequences.
Particles occur in sequences of two (eykey se), three (eykey se nun), and even four (ey se puthe
uy) or, rarely, more (ccum ey se poia to, .- ). The longer sequences usually enrl with one of the
particles un/nun, to, or uy. In my analysis the constituency cut is always between the particle on the
right and the remainder ofthe phrase, so that each particle 'peels of in turn from the right. Yet even
though this analysis does not treat the particles in sequence as in construction with each other, it is
interesting to see what sequences can be found. I have looked for all possible shorter combinations and
tried to elicit those which I could not fiod in texts. Some sequences alleged to exist (e.g. by CM) are
rejected because I have been unable to elicit satisfactory examples. Among these are:?* chetem iya mat lo; (ey) se lul; (ey) se to, ey wa; ina to,
pota 'na, pola uy, pota chelem, pota kkaci, pota ya mal lo,
man iya mal lo, iele 'na-ma to, tele uy, ulo lul, uto wn.
The sequences that have been found are supplied with substantiating examples in the entries of Part II.
Here part of that information is recapitulated in a different form,
Ignoring for the moment certrin syrK,nyms, such as the colloquial synonym hanthey for eykey,
and less interesting forms, such as poko and lele for only some of fte uses of eykey, we will examine
the sequences of particles that have been found lo occur after nouns and include the copula forms ila
to, inn(-ma), in tul, itun ci, and G)ta (ka) as if they were particles. Some of the strings are rare, an<l
sonte of thc examplcs are extremely,colloquial. Certain sequences could be elicitetl only in sentences
that speakers considered'awkward"". Untloubterlly there are sequences that have been missed; in
particular, I would expect to find more with final un/nun and to, since I did not try to elicit all
possible longer sequences with those two particles. Some ofthe sequences with i/ka as the last
member are ohtainahle only with the copula negative construction -.i/ka ani 'ta
lSee remarks at end
of $11.7.2) antl these are marker!'rv"". ln the lists I have used tlre <tesignations eykey, (k)wa, an4
sekken to include sequences that were actually found with the more common Seoul colloquial forms
hanthey, hako, and ilang/lang (respectively). The more exact information given in Part II suggests
that a few of the colloquial versions, because of the relative infrequency of the sequence, are rejecterl
in lrvor of the less colloquial synonyms; see, for example, the notes on mtrn kwa (
man hako),+kwa kkaci (* hako kkaci). Although hako occurs more freely than kwa/wa, certain extended
particle phrases ($6.3;, because of their stiff and titerary flavor, taie only kwa/wa: you do not hear
hako taking the place of the less colloquial particle in .- kwa/wa tongsi ey 'at the same time
(together) with - '.
In the two lists that follow, the sequences are given alphabetically: in the first list by the prior
member, in the second by the latter member. Each particle is listed by its postconsonantal shape eventhough the other shape might be appropriate to the particular sequence, so that eykey + ft)wa
=
eykey wa, eykey + i /ka
eykey ka. Space within two-word units is here shown as '_-.
It will be seen that virtually no other particle ever follows these markers:
i/ka lBut there are examples of i/ka tul in Part II. And see -ta ka ka in $6.6; this may be an
argument against that analysis.)

(perhaps somewhat unlikely) sentence: Cel.yak ulo ey ya mil lo nun khenyeng (un) hana to 6fs.tt
.Far from being a maner of economizing on them, I just haven't got a single one'. The particle ssik is
preceded only by ccum; the panicle mankhum is preceded only by chelem, eykey, and kkaci. In older

usage, mata is preceded only by ccum but modern usage prefers the order eykey mata,
and eykey se mala ftkey se mats) to the older usage with mata first; and rather than mata ey tho
modein usage prefers simply mata. Thal leaves ssik eykey and perhaps ccum eykey as the only
sequences with a particle preceding eykey.
Every particle that occurs after a noun is sometimes preceded by at least one other particle. That
criterion alone is sufticient to distinguish a panicle from a postnoun
The list of panicles excludes rhe sequence kkey se (honorific oblique subject); it has the sane
following partne;s as se alone, and additionally also i/ka, mata, and sekken. In Seoul sekken is
usually rlplaced by rhe synonym ilang; I have assumed that the distribution is the same in the samc
(se)'
meaning. ittrr p.tti.t. ilang is also used as a synonym of hako = kwa/wa'with'.) Like eykey
the sequence kkey se is preceded only by the particles ssik and mata, and modern usage refers kkey rc
msta. Not included are strings with piun (man) 'only' such as uto se ppun and ey se ppun maii,
which will be found in Part II. Notice Jso (in Part II) the unusuat sequerces uto sse (nun) and iyo mil
