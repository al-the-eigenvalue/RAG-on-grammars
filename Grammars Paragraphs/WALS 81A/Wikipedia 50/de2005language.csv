structurally as a “circumclitic”. The temporal marker precedes the element under the

Keenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to a
greater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea of
grammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who254points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities there
are amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way they
are. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processes
which themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that are
universal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may or
may not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.
In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammatical
relations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according to
language internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems of
alignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant for
the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé
(a) word order
(b) person prefixes
(c) independent pronouns
(d) person inflection in imperative clauses
(e) the use of reflexives
(f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
(g) switch-reference strategies
(h) valency-changing operations
(i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
(j) equi-deletion in complementation
(k) coreferential deletion in coordinationThe SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful
criterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-255intransitive system in simple main clauses, and an absolutive pattern in nonfinite clauses.
To go along with the absolutive pattern, criterion (i) reveals an ergative case-marking
system that is conditioned by subordination environments. All other criteria (c-h; j-k)
betray a nominative pattern and provide strong support for the grammatical relation
Subject in Apinajé.
On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in the
language. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the O
does not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person of
O. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a uniqueform, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the Direct
Object. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving no
syntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category with
the many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot be
indexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we push
them to the next category, that of Indirect Object.
If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of the
grammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In the
traditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, and
in the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bears
one of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the category
of Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have no
morphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"27confluence of the Tocantins and Araguaia Rivers in the north,16 traditional Apinajé
territory (Nimuendajú 1983).172.1. Genetic affiliation
Apinajé is classified as a Northern Jê language, along with Panará, Suyá, Kayapó, and
Timbira. Other branches of the family are Central Jê, which includes the Akwe
languages (Xavante and Xerente) and Southern Jê, consisting of Kaingáng and Xokléng.
Most Jê languages are spoken in cerrado areas, with the exception of Kayapó and Suyá,
spoken in rainforest areas (see e.g. Rodrigues 1986; 1999).
A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal
the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent
clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in
subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically
distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic
morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on
the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other
things.1816The area is known in Brazil as “Bico do Papagaio” (‘the parrot’s beak’).","[40, 41]"
"3.4.2. Equative predicates244Equative predicates functionally express a one-to-one identity relation between two
specific, referential entities, as in “I am Sam” or “I am your sister.” A structural
difference between the juxtaposition construction employed here and the one expressing
proper inclusion is that here a personal prefix on the predicate noun indicates the
possessor, and not the subject. The subject is encoded rather by a free pronoun, although
its order relative to the mood marker remains reversed as compared to verbal clauses: the
pronoun occurs clause-initially, and not in second position.(65) a. pa

verbal clauses primarily with respect to the relative order of the mood marker and the

predicator is not coreferential with the subject of the clause.","[257, 258]"
"The definitional criteria put forward by them are seen, admitedly, as types rather
than universal criteria, which may not apply to every language. In regard to the definition
of a grammatical word, however, they offer what they see as a set of universal criteria.
Their list is as follows:A grammatical word consists of a number of grammatical elements which:
(a) always occur together, rather than scattered through the clause (the
criterion of cohesiveness);
(b) occur in a fixed order;
(c) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning. (...)
(d) Morphological processes involved in the formation of words tend to be
non-recursive. That is, one element will not appear twice in a word. (...)
(e) There will be just one inflectional affix per word. (...)
(f) A speaker may pause between words but not within a word. (...)
(g) A word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself (Dixon and
Aikhenvald 2002:19-25).",[102]

syntactic context; in this sense, they are syntactically bound (details in section 3.2.2).
The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criteria
listed in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internally
cohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically,
because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component92morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word clitics
always occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word final
boundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thus
indicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word without
interruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort,
which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical word
can constitute a complete utterance by itself.","[105, 106]"

Spike GildeaThe dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spoken
by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the core
facts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogical
perspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts
and a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternative
interpretation for the inventory of phonemes as compared to earlier analyses, pointing to
phonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findings
regarding the historical development of the language. Apinajé morphemes are typically
monosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression of
grammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages.
Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especially
with respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs andv
Postpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterized
morphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are either
semantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal or
semantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituency
constitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions,
and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitives
and descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal personmarking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructions
include verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking a
characteristic of subordinate clauses.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
"Ku- Verb Stems. Ku- verbs constitute a morphological class only, since the semantics
that unites verbs in this set is opaque. In general, though, the semantics characteristic of
the ku- verb set seems to focus on movement or direct contact against a surface. For
instance, in order to wash a firm object, such as a table or one’s body, one might think of
rubbing a brush or soap against the surface of that object; in the seemingly more
problematic case of kukw ‘break hard-shelled nuts’, as compared with kakw ‘dig;
poke’, the action again affects the surface of the item being broken, and so on. Ku- verbs
are mostly transitives (although there are a few exceptions), and they do not display any
structural idiosyncrasies.",[137]
"4.1. Person marking
First, examples (83-84) illustrate the use of person prefixes. In finite verb forms O and
some S are morphologically marked in the verbal stem (83). In nonfinite verb forms, all S
and O participants are marked by prefixes (84).(83) a. pi

as well as the use of word order for the identification of A and O, are illustrated in section
3.3.","[270, 271]"
"3.4.1. Proper inclusion predicates
Functionally, proper inclusion predicates indicate the membership of a given entity into a
general class, as in “I am a teacher.” In Apinajé, a juxtaposition construction expressing243this kind of predication does not require the presence of a free pronoun for the expression
of the subject. Here, the person prefix attached to the predicate noun is what indicates the
subject, regardless of whether a pronoun also occurs. Should a pronoun be included in
the clause, it would appear preceding the modality marker and agreeing with the prefix,
as illustrated in the elicited examples presented below.(64) a. pa

‘This is a knife.’This construction type then differs structurally from verbal clauses and descriptive
predicates because of the potential absence of the independent pronoun, and the reversed
relative order of the mood marker and the pronoun when one occurs at all. In addition, it
is specifically distinct from descriptive predicate constructions in that, even though
pronominal prefixes refer to the subject in both, in the nominal predicate construction the
prefix structurally encodes the subject, rather just than agreeing with it.","[256, 257]"
"RelativizationRelativization in Apinajé is necessarily expressed by means of subordination. Thus,
other morphosyntactic properties internal to Apinajé relative clauses include the facts that
the verb must occur in its nonfinite form and, if it is a transitive verb, the ergative case
marker must occur on the first nominal constituent of the subordinate clause.
Additionally, the definite marker ja must occur at the end boundary of the clause, being
optionally preceded by the agent nominalizer cw, which occurs most often (though not
strictly) with verbs of action or activity. The order of elements remains basically the
same as in simple clauses.
Relativization is carried out by means of both internal and external relative
clauses (meaning “internally headed” and “externally headed,” as in the terminology and
typology proposed in Keenan 1985, inter alia). The choice for one or the other strategy
depends on the position being relativized. Positions that may be relativized are A, S, O
and the dative/recipient (Keenan and Comrie 1977; Givón 2001b). When an external
relative clause is employed, it will be of the postnominal type, as the RC will come
postposed to the head noun.
Of the positions that may be relativized, S and O form verb phrase-internal
absolutives and are thus grammatically required to occur in internally headed relative
clauses; however, the head may occur externally if a third person resumptive pronoun is
employed in the required position. The ergative A is always external to the RC, with the
person prefix (or the suppletive form) of the ergative marker serving as a resumptive282pronoun. A relativized dative participant is external to the RC, with no need for a
resumptive pronoun.
The examples in (6) illustrate these points. (6.a) shows the regular use of the verb
are ‘tell’ in a simple clause, for comparison with the other constructions. In (6.b), the
noun b ‘man’ is the understood head of the RC and occurs within the restrictive clause.
That is so because b is the second argument of the verb are, and accordingly, it occurs
immediately preposed to the verb, which takes the relational prefix; the same is true of di
‘woman’ in (6.c), the S argument of the verb ca ‘stand’. In (6.c-d), on the other hand, the
relativized element di ‘woman’ is the A argument of are ‘tell’. The external relative
strategy applies in this case, with the restrictive clause following the head noun. Notice in
(6.d) the presence of the third person ergative marker kt inside the subordinate clause;
the ergative case marker is coreferential with the external head noun and serves as a
resumptive pronoun.(6) a. pa

‘This woman who told me about you has already left.’The examples in (7-9) further illustrate the point. In (8), the relativized element is
the dative participant, which also occurs internally in the relative clause. Thus the
instances in which externally headed relative clauses occur include mostly cases of
ergative relativization, but are not limited to this. For instance, consider (9.b), where the
second argument of the verb, mekdc ‘medication’, appears in initial position in the
sentence. Inside the relative clause, the subordinate verb appears without the relational
prefix, since its object is not contiguous to it. Examples of this kind were not very
frequent during elicitation sessions. It is possible that this fronting of the object of the RC
is a pragmatic strategy for placing it under focus, in which case this construction would
be more marked than those in which the relativized object occurs internal to the relative
clause. It is also possible that this is all artefacts of elicitation; further (textual) examples
are still needed for clarification of this point.","[295, 296, 297]"
"198While relational prefixes are indicative of constituent internal cohesion, other
morphological devices delimit the initial and final boundaries of certain types of (phrasal
and clausal) constituents. These devices include (a) nonfiniteness suffixes, (b) ergative
clitics, (c) nominalizers and (d) determiners, like the definite article ja. Most of these
markers pertain to subordination, and the roles they perform in such contexts are
discussed in chapter V. With respect to constituency, however, positional clitics (b-d)
overtly set the boundaries for clausal constituents.
Distributional criteria include (a) the relative order of elements inside the
constituent and (b) the distribution of the constituent in the sentence, along with (c) the
distribution of overt indices of constituent internal cohesion and boundaries.
Prosodic, morphological and distributional criteria for the establishment of
constituency are illustrated and discussed further in the following sections.","[211, 212]"

goSome alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme  in
this context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in the
grammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that  is the instrumental postposition
in the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the preceding
verb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominal
than verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.
Another hypothesis is that the morpheme  appearing in these contexts is the
transitive verb ‘do’, which likewise could require a more nominal form of the lexical
verb. According to this interpretation, the sequence of elements involved could be
analyzed as a case of verb serialization, including the lexical verb, the verb , and the
movement or position verb.","[308, 309]"
"221.3. Apinajé society in the twenty-first century
Currently, there are thirteen Apinajé villages, with São José (formerly Bacaba;
Krijobreire leadership) and Mariazinha (Cocojoire leadership) being the largest and
oldest ones, and the smaller villages having been derived from either one or the other.12
Thus, the villages of Cocalinho, Patizal, Buriti Comprido, Palmeiras, Prata, Cocal Grande
and Serrinha have been founded by former members of the São José community, whereas
Botica, Riachinho, Bonito and Brejão were founded by former dwellers of Mariazinha.
Except for the most recent settlements, namely, Brejão, Cocal Grande, Palmeiras,
Prata, and Serrinha, all villages include a medical assistance facility provided by FUNASA,
where a (non-Indian) staff person assists community members full time during weekdays.
In order to receive routine medical assistance of this kind, dwellers of the younger
settlements must take a trip to the nearest Apinajé village. As a complement to this more
basic health service, a physician visits the villages every two weeks in order to provide
more detailed medical examination. Patients suffering from serious illnesses are sent to
urban centers for medical attention.
Another initiative taken by FUNASA has been the implementation of infrastructural conditions for water treatment as a preventive measure against the proliferation12The Rõrkojoire abandoned their villages at the Araguaia in the first half of the twentieth century. The
village of São Paulo, at the margins of the Araguaia, was abandoned in 1920; the Apinajé were uneasy with
the proximity with the Kayapó, and moved south to reunite with the Rõrkojoire of São Martinho. That
village, in turn, existed until 1943, when an epidemic of fevers nearly decimated the population. Chief
Mãtyk and the Krijobreire rescued the survivors, taking them to Bacaba. Some of the Rõrkojoire remained
with the Krijobreire (Bacaba/São José) and others joined the Cocojoire (Mariazinha).","[35, 36]"
"IntroductionThe present chapter discusses those construction types that encompass more than one
predicator within a single syntactic unit. Arguments are typically shared, but that may not
necessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are the
domains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as a
complex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b)
relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within a
noun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantial
information that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is,
clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectual
meanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) the
comparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, also
constitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by the
types of syntactic strategies described here.
In structural terms, these functional domains are expressed in Apinajé by means
of subordination embedding, parataxis, and serialization. Many cases of
complementation make use of embedding, while in others parataxis is used (Noonan2741985: 44; 55). The alternation between one type of construction and the other within this
domain is determined by the syntactic properties of complement-taking verbs, which are,
in general, of the non-canonical marking type. The alternation between subordination
and parataxis is observable also among the different types of adverbial clauses, although
parataxis is more frequently used.
On the other hand, relative clauses are always embedded inside the noun phrase.
Certain properties commonly found in subordinating constructions, such as the use of the
nonfinite form of verbs, are also necessarily employed in the expression the comparative
of superiority and one type of inchoative construction. The structural properties observed
in the latter cases, which are typologically less common, are crystallized and presumably
result from the diachronic development of source biclausal constructions, in which the
modern main verb was subordinate and the modern postverbal particle was the main verb.
The original main verbs eventually became reanalyzed and grammaticalized as function
words, which they still are in the synchronic stage of the language.
Serialization is a structural strategy often used for the expression of the
progressive and continuous aspects, as well as the more adverbial manner nuance.
The discussion proposed here is intended to be broad enough that it will touch on
the various structural strategies observed in the corpus for the expression of typologically
common functional domains, but it is by no means intended as an exhaustive account of
the inventory of complex predicates and constructions found in Apinajé. That is a task
that requires continued analysis of the data already found and yet to be included in my
database. For the time being, however, the present chapter should serve as a275representative sample. The formal properties of subordination, parataxis, and
serialization in Apinajé are introduced briefly in the remainder of this section; subsequent
sections elaborate on structure in further detail, along with the functional domains
expressed by each structure.
Subordination in Apinajé requires that the relevant verb be inflected for
nonfiniteness. The ergative case marker may or may not mark the A argument,
depending on coreference conditions. In complementation, the distribution of a
subordinate predicate is the same as that of the equivalent nominal. The matrix verb
occurs in final position, postposed to the subordinated element.
Paratactic clauses are finite, displaying the very same structure as independent
simple clauses. Parataxis may require the same-subject or different-subject switchreference markers, where pertinent, and it often involves morphemes from the TAM clitic
inventory.
Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative or
instrumental morpheme) verb  ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form of
verbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the class
of intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serialization
always involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging to
each category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, but
only a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resulting
overall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yielding
awkward or jocose meanings.","[287, 288, 289]"
"Co-occurrence restrictions. Some determiners may co-occur within the same noun
phrase. In my database, the only determiners that appear as such are the ones in (15)
below, and only in the relative orders presented. The juxtaposition of determiners
encodes specific semantic nuances in a more hierarchical than linear way, structurally.
Here, determiners perform distinct functions within the same noun phrase, such that one
member of the class heads the other. Consider the examples below, among them (6.b),

stand207In (15.a), the marker ja indicates definiteness and referentiality pertaining to the
phrase ‘slice of meat/sliced meat’; the indefinite marker õ, in turn, encodes a (generic,
non-specified) portion of that referent. Thus, the indefinite marker õ heads the definite
noun phrase br ire ja in a genitive construction, whereby it expresses the partitive
category. The constituency relation is indicated here by the intonation pattern and the
cohesive distribution of the elements with respect to one another and the verb.
The examples in (15.b-c) involve the definite marker ja and the distal
demonstrative muj. Here, the definite article has a third person pronominal function and
heads the phrase; and the distal demonstrative performs its regular function as a
determiner of the head.","[220, 221]"

1-angry4.7.3. Coreferential deletion
Onishi (2001) observes that languages with clear syntactic derivations have
constraints on many clause-linking devices; for instance, they may required that one of
two coreferential arguments be deleted in such contexts (what Dixon 1994 terms “pivot
conditions”). Languages in which semantic roles dominate the process typically lack
these constraints, whereas languages with noncanonically marked arguments have an271intermediary status. In general, noncanonically marked A/S are more likely to control
pivot constraints than to become targets of such constraints. Some languages allow
predicates with non-canonically marked A/S to occur both in the main and the
complement clause. In general, restrictions on the occurrence of predicates with
noncanonically marked arguments are more likely to apply when they function as target
of coreferential deletion in the complement clause.
In Apinajé, most, if not all complement-taking verbs are noncanonical predicates.
There seems to be no restrictions as far as the occurrence of noncanonical predicates in
complement positions either. Under coreferentiality conditions, all relevant arguments are
marked with person prefixes on the verb and the postposition, as applicable. However, no
independent pronouns occur in the subordinate clause, that is, there is A/S coreferential
deletion. On the other hand, when there is no coreferentiality between A and/or S of both
clauses, the occurrence of the ergative marker in the subordinate clause is obligatory.(107) a. i-m

2-RP-abandon4.8. Conclusions
At this point, sufficient evidence has converged to argue for a convincing
grammatical category of Subject, a morphologically heterogeneous category that is united
by syntactic behaviors. In future research, this category might become even stronger, as
the database lacked examples of noncanonical predicates with noun phrase coordination,
in sentences that engage the switch reference system, and in valency-changing
derivations. In any of these, the noncanonical A arguments might share yet one more
syntactic pattern with the canonical A.
In contrast, the search for syntactic properties that distinguish the categories of
Direct Object and Indirect Object was unsuccessful, leaving a potentially interesting topic
for future research.","[284, 285, 286]"
"In the first construction (‘SBJ will X, then SBJ will Y’), the particle ri is
immediately postposed to the clause(s) describing the first event in the sequence; the
clause expressing the second event occurs last in the sentence. In the examples below,
the two events in sequence share the same subject, so the subject is mentioned only once
at the beginning of the sentence.
Example (16.b) is more complex in that the first event of the sequence consists of
two clauses – i.e. two minor events: the wait for the potatoes to cook, and the cooking of
the potatoes. Within that domain, the subjects of the first and second events are distinct,290thus the different-subject third person conjunction occurs in the second clause. Although
there is no structural evidence of subordination between the clauses expressing the first
and second events, the ‘cook’ clause stands in a complement-type relation with the ‘wait’
clause, albeit semantically. For the purposes of the construction being described in the
present section, those two clauses are taken here as if constituting a unit.(16) a. Kt paj

[Lit.: “At the conclusion of my waiting for my potatoes to cook, I’ll eat.”]The second possibility (‘before SBJ X, SBJ will Y’) includes the negative marker
ket. Here, the order of the clauses is reversed in the sentence: the first clause encodes the
event that should happen last in the sequence; the particle ri occurs postposed to this
clause and the negator ket modifies its predicate.(17) a. Kt paj

whether that clause indicates the initial or the final event of the sequence depends on the
occurrence of the negative marker ket.
Some aspects in the overall structure of ri constructions which show that the rimarked clause is in fact structurally subordinate to that in sentence-final position are as
follows. In examples (16.a) and (17.b), repeated as (18) below, the sentence-final clauses
have the typical distribution of a main predicate, and the subject of each is that expressed
by the nominative pronoun at the beginning of the whole complex sentence. As for the
ri-marked elements, they have the distribution that a postpositional phrase would have,
and they come marked with a postposed particle that, in other contexts, may function
either as a demonstrative or a locative. An alternative semantic interpretation of the rimarked expressions in the examples below then could be, respectively, ‘at/upon/when
[clause]’. Hence the alternative translations:(18) a. Kt paj

The morpheme kutep marks a temporal adverbial construction, which consists of
clauses that encode simultaneous events. The clauses in question do not occur in a
subordinating relation: they occur in a paratactic relation with one another and each has
its own subject. That the clauses involved belong in the same sentence is indicated by the
fact that they fall under the scope of the same mood marker; and by the intonation pattern
of the utterance, which clearly includes them both.
The morpheme kutep is a postposition that indicates something like ‘in one’s
stead’. Functionally, it clearly indicates the simultaneous relation between the events
described in each clause. As to its distribution in the sentence, it occurs in the clause that
serves as the ground event with respect to which the other, simultaneous event is located.
The person index occurring in kutep refers to the subject of the second, “figure”
clause in the temporal relation, as expressed by agreement with the independent pronoun.(19) a. Ktka

synchronically. Notice that it does not even display the same morphological behavior as
that of stems beginning with the formative u- (section 3.1.2.2).
While it is true that the sequence aw- occurs mostly with transitive stems
beginning in /a/, its distribution is not so limited. Aw- also appears on two consonantinitial bases: the descriptive stems kagr ‘be hot’ and r ‘be long’. The other descriptive
stem with which aw- occurs is akr ‘cold’. The semantics of aw- in these forms appears
to conform to that observed in transitive stems, i.e. the patient — here the sole argument
— takes generic or impersonal semantics. If, on the one hand, each morpheme a- and uhas its own particular function, on the other, they must occur in combination in order to133convey the meaning observed in the examples, the nonfinite formal changes
notwithstanding.","[146, 147]"
"1.5. The school system25The Constitution of 1988 guarantees the right of all autochthonous populations to
differentiated, bilingual education. This recent development has resulted in more
systematic governmental support for indigenous schools in Brazil, at least in regard to
their infrastructural conditions.
School buildings exist in all Apinajé villages, except the youngest ones, which are
still in the process of structuring themselves (namely, Brejão, Cocal Grande and
Serrinha).14 The core of infrastructural conditions for the Apinajé school system is
provided by the State of Tocantins, following the legislation enforced by the Brazilian
Ministry of Education (MEC). Instructors, books, supplies, and food for the school
community are all provided by the State.
The first initiatives in the production of didactic materials for the Apinajé were
taken by missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Missionary Patricia Ham
was responsible for the elaboration of the Apinajé orthography in the 1960’s. That
orthography is still currently in use. She also elaborated school books for Apinajé
language teaching and helped organize various books of reading in Apinajé (many
Apinajé individuals were involved in the latter project).
Other, not as fruitful, initiatives were taken by the University of Goiás and the
University of Tocantins, in the early eighties and late nineties, respectively. On these
occasions, a few reading books were also produced for Apinajé schools. In addition,14Dwellers of younger settlements must commute to the nearest Apinajé school in order to pursue their
studies.","[38, 39]"

The purpose of this dissertation is to present a description of the language spoken by the
Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. The study is based on original
data collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 and
August 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city of
Goiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work is
intended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as further
analysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns as
can possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology,
lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study will
serve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstruction
of the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the better
understanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number of
little-documented South American languages.
The dissertation discusses the principal facts about Apinajé and includes three
appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts and a preliminary dictionary. The
remainder of this chapter presents general information about the Apinajé people,
including some details about their culture and social organization; geographical,
historical, and demographic facts; observations about language contact situations and the2school system available in the communities; as well as details about the genetic affiliation
and previous studies done on the language. Methodological considerations and
information about the database for the study, as well as conventions used in the text, are
also presented in this chapter.
Because most previous studies focus on the phonology of Apinajé, the core of my
research project has been devoted primarily to the study of its grammar. Nonetheless,
facts about its phonology and morphophonology were also captured during my time in
and out of the field. These observations are presented in Chapter II, along with a
discussion of previous literature on Apinajé phonology. Chapter III is an introduction to
Apinajé morphology in which the relevant morphological units and categories are
presented. Chapter IV presents the syntactic and morphosyntactic properties of phrases
and simple clauses. Subordination, serialization and other kinds of complex
constructions are discussed in Chapter V. Chapter VI is the concluding section; it
summarizes the major facts about Apinajé discussed in this work, includes some
language internal hypotheses about the development of certain forms and structures, and
points to areas that deserve further investigation. Illustrative maps regarding the history
and geographical distribution of the Apinajé are found in Appendix A. Appendix B
provides three text samples: a traditional story, a personal experience narrative, and an
instructional narrative. Appendix C, the Apinajé Dictionary, was created out of the
material available the general database I started in 1995, in addition to the items I
collected primarily my the lexicographical project. Appendix D is a list of abbreviations
used in the glosses.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"
"3.1. Lexical categories
The categories Noun, Verb and Postposition share inflectional properties. The same set
of person prefixes is employed in the expression of possession, grammatical relations,
and postpositional objects. In rare instances, Nouns and Verbs may even display the
same derivational morphology. The fluidity that exists among Nouns and Verbs is also
noticeable in conversion, fairly common in the language. The similarities between each
of these classes and Postpositions is indicative of the diachronic sources of postpositions.
The same is partly true for adverbials, some of which may have verbal or nominal
sources.
The morphological and semantic properties of the various lexical classes are
introduced in what follows.",[120]

"100Benveniste 1967) call attention to the fact that compounds display internal syntactic
structuring, among other syntactic properties; whereas those that argue for the affiliation
of compounds to the domain of morphology (e.g. Matthews 1993) point out that these
complex elements name (rather than describe) entities, properties or events, and that they
are learned as a single units, i.e. lexemes, by young speakers. The approach adopted here
for the analysis of the Apinajé data is one which takes into consideration both views. I
will seek to justify an analysis of compounds as morphologically complex lexical units
by providing criteria that distinguish them from ordinary phrases, but I will also
demonstrate the possible combinations of basic elements, and how these elements may
form constituents within the compound itself.
Apinajé compounds consist of more than one putative phonological word, since
they consist of more than one root. They also have an internal structural organization
whereby the stress patterns of each putative phonological word must be combined, and
thus constitute what I term here a phonological phrase. Compounds are phonological
phrases that correspond to grammatical words. That they are words (not syntactic
phrases) can be established on the grounds of internal cohesion and conventionalized
meaning (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 19), as well as prosodic properties and certain
phonological processes.
For the most part, Apinajé compounds are not characterized by any obvious stress
shifts, as compared to grammatical phrase patterns. However, the phonological phrase
that results from compounding displays a particular, cohesive intonation pattern, that
comes accompanied by a rearrangement of the overall stress pattern of the word. It can101be described, in the terms of Hayes (1995), as an iambic stress pattern, parsed from right
to left, with final prominence, foot construction being iterative. These phonological
properties of compounds are illustrated below, after their structural properties have been
introduced.
Compound stems are verbs and nouns. In terms of internal structure, these
grammatical words may involve nominal, verbal and postpositional bases, as well as
clitics.","[113, 114, 115]"

In 1748, the mining district acquired the status of Capitania Geral de Goyaz thus
becoming administratively independent from São Paulo. The need for executive
autonomy was a consequence of the district’s economic and population growth. By that
time, a newly formed local population was emerging, resulting from the offspring of
European men with African and Native women, since European women were not to be
found in the “sertões” (Larousse 1977).
With the decline of gold-mining productivity in the second half of the eighteenth
century, subsistence agriculture and cattle farming gave new character to the region. The
importance of fluvial navigation for commercial purposes became highlighted and, in the
following years, both Goyaz and Grão-Pará organized expeditions in order to assess the
conditions for the fluvial transportation of goods (A. Oliveira 1994).","[24, 25]"

"1971. Criteria for the establishment of constituency
Phrasal and clausal constituency are detectable in Apinajé according to three types of
criteria: prosodic, morphological, and distributional. By prosodic criteria I mean (a) the
intonation contour that characterizes phrases and larger constituents as internally
cohesive units, and (b) stress patterns characteristic of such combination of elements.
Another phonological criterion that may help identify the boundaries of a constituent is
the echo-vowel phenomenon, which is indicative of final boundary and must be followed
by silence (sections II.4.5 and III.2.1). This criterion, although helpful, is not as
specifically indicative of constituency, since it may delimit a word said at random, that is,
one that is not necessarily in a constituency relation with some other element (a word
uttered as a citation form, for instance).
The main morphological criterion to be considered is the use of relational prefixes
(section III.4.1.2), which are precisely the overt grammatical marking of phrasal
constituency in Jê (and other Macro-Jê) languages. Relational prefixes are common to
noun, verb, and postpositional phrases, and indicate contiguity between the head of a
phrase and its dependent. Such contiguity is one of the clues for the constituency relation
between the elements, and a violation of this state of affairs has overt grammatical
repercussions as well, such as the use of specific person prefixes for head marking
(section 2.3). Even though the relational prefix strategy indicates the bond between twoword units, and thus would not seem as useful for larger units, it may reccur in sequences
of more than two words thus indicating relevant constituency relations among the units
that participate in the hierarchy (provided the elements involved are vowel-initial).","[210, 211]"
"17In an interview on this subject, an Apinajé speaker declared his total lack of familiarity with the latter
terms. Most interesting in this case would be to check on the word for ‘tip, corner’ in any of the Timbira
languages.
18Data examined are from Alves (2002), Timbira Apanjekrá; Reis Silva (2003) and Salanova (2001),
Mebengokre Kayapó; Santos (2004), Suyá; and Dourado (2001), Panará.",[41]
"3.1.3. Postpositions
Postpositions constitute a (rather large) closed class in Apinajé. Postpositions occur
postposed to their object noun phrase or, in the absence of an overt dependent noun
phrase, they inflect for person in the same way as Verbs and Nouns. The set of person
prefixes used is the same for all three lexical categories, as is the complementary
distribution between prefixes and noun phrases.
The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at odds
with the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set of
standard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical than
lexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem more
like postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here
“relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions in
Apinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfway
open” class.
Relator nouns are lexemes whose semantics extend metaphorically into
grammatical meanings related to space orientation and position. Typically, relator nouns
are body part terms, or part-whole terms which pattern as inalienable nouns in languages
that make this distinction (DeLancey 1997). This kind of diachronic development is140fairly common crosslinguistically. In Apinajé, it is possible to observe, at the synchronic
level, hints of the grammaticalization of some nouns into postpositions, as will be seen.
Although there seems to exist a tendency for postpositions to evolve from nouns
in Apinajé, there is at least one instance of a postposition having a verb as its diachronic
source. That is the case of the instrumental postposition  and the verb  ‘do’ (Oliveira
1998).
The set of grammatical postpositions and some selected relator nouns are
introduced in what follows.","[153, 154]"
"WordIn any language, words can be characterized in terms of phonological and grammatical
properties, which constitute independent criterial dimensions. One general definition of
the phonological word is provided in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) as follows:A phonological word is a phonological unit larger than the syllable (in some
languages it may minimally be just one syllable) which has at least one (and
generally more than one) phonological defining property chosen from the
following areas:and occupy predictable positions in clauses and phrases.",[101]
"IntroductionFor the unacquainted observer, Apinajé may appear as a morphologically plain language
of the analytic kind, consisting of rather short words, and having much of its grammatical
categories expressed by function words rather than bound morphemes. That impression
is justified: Apinajé morphemes are monosyllabic indeed, and the grammatical
categories found in the language are often expressed by function words that may or may
not be phonologically dependent, or by syntactic constructions that often times employ a
subset of these very function words.
However, Apinajé words are not necessarily monomorphemic – nor
monosyllabic, for that matter. Words consisting of more than one syllable usually consist
of as many morphemes; and Apinajé morphology is rather rich, especially in regard to
content words. Thus, Apinajé may be typologically characterized as an agglutinating
language of analytic spirit, with compounding and prefixation playing major roles in
word formation. The predominance of prefixes over suffixes is reminiscent of the fact
that Apinajé is a head final language: syntactically dependent elements serve as a
diachronic source for phonologically dependent ones.",[95]

on the basis of the category of number, among other details. Morphology: The verb 
‘serve’ is almost homophonous with the verb r ‘cook’, except that the former has a
different finite form and a relational prefix, and the latter has the same form in both
finite and nonfinite positions, and it has no relational prefix. Ex.: Na ktm meõ kw

Na wa atpen t krikrit. ‘The two of them are racing each other.’ Na ka wa atpen t
akrikrit ketne. ‘The two of you are not racing one another.’ See krikrit.
v.intr. sit. Nonfinite form: S=r. Semantics: The semantic contrast between this verb
and kri appears to be that the former indicates movement towards sitting position,
whereas the latter indicates being in sitting position. However, only  seems to occur
in constructions that require position verbs, indicating, in this case, something already
in sitting position. This hypothesis is at odds with the morphological class of each
verb and their correlation with descriptive and eventive notions. Another hypothesis is
that the contrast may have to do with the number of participants,  being the singular
and kri the plural counterpart. A third hypothesis is that both verbs mean ‘be sitting’,
but with the semantics of kri focusing on the resultative aspect of sitting down, and 
not having such connotation. Grammar: a. This verb is used in VV constructions,
indicating progressive or continuative aspect. b. The verbs nõ ‘lie’ and  ‘sit’ contrast
with their respective counterparts ikw and kri in that the former seem to have a more
flexible use, with respect to the number distinction of the absolutive, than the latter. It421ˆ)rkuremis possible to find examples of m nõ and m , even though these verbs refer
basically to singular and dual absolutives; but kri and ikw are often not found with
singular absolutives. Ex.: Pip  muj  . ‘Sit on that bench.’ See r, kri.

its counterpart ujw) is used with reference to objects shaped in such a way that allow
the speaker to conceive of them as “standing up”, such as plates or cups. Its use would
be more problematic with objects such as forks and knives, for instance, since these
kinds of objects are typically laid in horizontal position. Ex.: Kt paj ami m kuw

"The list certainly includes criteria that cannot be taken to the letter, or, as Dixon
and Aikhenvald put it, they must be “tempered by a number of caveats”. In the case of
Apinajé, at least two of those certainly do not apply, namely, criteria (d, e). As will be
seen, relational prefixes, for instance, can certainly appear more than once in a word
(section 3.1.2.4, example (63)). In addition, a relational prefix must necessarily co-occur89with a person prefix in the context of a vowel-initial stem; and both relational and person
prefixes are inflectional morphemes in Apinajé.
Dixon and Aikhenvald call attention to the fact that a phonological word – or, the
word as defined by its phonological properties – in a given language, may or may not
coincide with a grammatical word in the same language. Thus, a grammatical word may
consist of more than one phonological word or, likewise, a phonological word may
consist of more than one grammatical word. In the first case, they cite the example of
Yimas (Foley 1991: 86, cited in Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002), in which compounds
(grammatical words) are composed of more than one phonological word (the
participating nouns), in that they bear individual primary stresses. As an illustration of
the second case, they cite examples of one positional clitic in Dyirbal (p. 27-28).
In Apinajé, as will be seen, a grammatical word may comprise more than one
phonological word. The grammatical and phonological criteria for the delimitation of the
word in Apinajé are addressed next.","[102, 103]"
"196CHAPTER IVSYNTAX0. Introduction
The structural and semantic properties of phrases and simple clauses, and the functional
motivation behind possible construction options, constitute the subject of the present
chapter. Section 1 introduces the relevant criteria for the establishment of constituency in
Apinajé. Section 2 presents the morphosyntactic properties shared by the noun phrase,
the postpositional phrase and the verb phrase, as well as those properties typical of each.
Section 3 discusses the various clause types. Relevant clause-level grammatical
distinctions, such as realis and irrealis mode, and the formal expression of speech-act
distinctions, serve in part as the base for a structural subcategorization of simple clauses;
for that reason, they are introduced first. Section 4 is a discussion of grammatical
relations in terms of the morphological and syntactic properties that characterize such
relations in Apinajé. Valency-changing operations, which affect not only the
morphological composition of predicators but also the grammatical properties of the
clause as a whole, are presented in section 5. Section 6 summarizes the findings imparted
in this chapter and offers language-internal hypotheses about the historical development
of some of the grammatical patterns observed.","[209, 210]"
"3. Methodological considerations and fieldwork conditions
The present dissertation is deliberately a descriptive study. It has a functional and
typological orientation, and includes some diachronic hypotheses for the interpretation of
certain blurry domains. It is meant to serve as a useful source for readers interested in
learning about the Apinajé language, researchers interested in typological studies, and
linguists engaged in the study of Macro-Jê languages, especially in historicalcomparative studies for the reconstruction of Proto-Jê. For these reasons, I have
deliberately avoided formal approaches to language, which sometimes obscure the
explanation of the data and usually tend to become rapidly outdated.
In the remainder of this section, I comment on fieldwork conditions and on
methodological strategies for data collection that I have applied during my research.
My initial interviews with Apinajé speakers occurred in Goiânia, Goiás State. I
met Amci Creuza de Souza Fernandes and Dioro Aparecida Laranja in the second half of301995. Dioro had brought her son to Goiânia for medical attention and they were staying
at the Casa do Índio, a hostel unit provided by FUNAI for patients and their caregivers.
I had heard about Dioro’s party through the staff of the local FUNAI office, so I
proceeded to visit with them at the Casa do Índio. We eventually made arrangements for
a recorded interview at the Setor de Etnolingüística of the Museu Antropológico
(University of Goiás) to take place a few days later. In that interview and others that
followed we recorded word lists and short texts, which I used for preliminary
phonological and grammatical analysis. Those meetings occurred in October 1995.
Two weeks later Amci and Dioro received me at the village of São José for a six
week fieldwork session. I decided from the outset to work most directly with the women.
I accompanied them in their daily tasks such that we had plenty to talk about during
recording and interview sessions. I collected most personal experience narratives in that
way. For a beginner in the study of the language, having been present at the events
narrated allowed me to capture the semantic nuances of certain utterances more promptly
than I would have otherwise.
My main consultants turned out to be Amci (Dir) and Ir Rita Dias Laranja, who
was introduced to me by Amci herself. Other major consultants I met in that first session
were Kojkoti Iraci Dias (Dkr) and Grri Júlia Estêvão (Dada, my adoptive mother), the
daughter of late Velho Estêvão, former Chief of São José.
Besides contributing personal experience narratives to the database, Dkr took it
upon herself to teach me how to do things properly while in Apinajé country (see Text II,31Appendix B). Grri contributed a significant part of the traditional narratives in my
database over the years. From her storytelling comes the version of the Apinajé creation
myth found in Appendix B (Text I). Another version of the myth, as well as other
traditional stories were provided by Gr o Júlia Corredor; recording sessions with Gr o
started in 1999.
The interviews I conducted with male speakers were usually mediated by Amci
and Ir, although in certain cases I made the arrangements with the speakers myself.
That was the case with Daniel Laranja Rodrigues (Kiki), who contributed a procedural
narrative as well as elicited data. Vame Miguel Fernandes provided a number of
traditional stories, and Bogo Moisés Dias Roxo (Velho Moisés) contributed valuable
information on animals, plants, and traditional weapons and crafts, which was used in the
lexicographical project. Interviews with Vame started in 1997, and those with Bogo
occurred in 2000.
In 2004, I also conducted interviews with a male speaker, who wishes to remain
anonymous, about general information on the villages and the Apinajé school system; he
also aided me in some follow up work on the phonology of the language.
The transcription and translation of most narratives were done with the assistance
of Amci and Ir. They also contributed some texts of their own (testimonies and
instructional narratives – see Text III, Appendix B) and the bulk of the elicited material32found in the database.19 Although these women are illiterate, their keen linguistic
awareness and passionate interest in their native language and culture proved essential for
the development of the project.
Besides the main consultants introduced above, other speakers — men, women,
and children — contributed to the database either through scheduled interviews, informal
conversations or in a more passive manner, as I took linguistic notes on the way they
spoke with one another.
The database consists of about ten hours of recorded material and various books
of elicited data. It includes some additional three hours of songs in Krikatí recorded live
at the B rkape festival that took place in São José in mid 2000;20 those songs are
permeated with conversations and ceremonial forms of speech in Apinajé. It was on that
same occasion that I recorded a personal experience narrative by Irptsi Maria Barbosa,
Amci’s mother, who passed away in 2002.
About six and a half hours of the recorded texts have been transcribed and
analyzed, with their transcriptions and analyses having undergone at least one round of
revisions. The remainder of the recordings has not been transcribed yet.
Between 1995 and 2000, I worked with speakers in and out of the field, although I
spent more time conducting my research in the indigenous land itself. The time I spent1920Kojkoti (Dkr) assisted in a few transcription sessions as well.","[43, 44, 45, 46]"
"2.2. Documentational material and previous studies
The first records of the Apinajé language were short lists of words and clauses. The first
known record was a 38-word list collected by a military man in São João das Duas Barras
in the nineteenth century. The list, which according to Curt Nimuendajú’s assessment
was poorly transcribed and contained some mistakes, was published in Castelnau (1844:
1850-51); in the same publication, Castelnau includes a list of 177 words collected by
himself. Leal (1895: 125-29) reproduces Castelnau’s list with Portuguese orthography.
Sampaio (1911) inadvertently collected 206 words and phrases in Apinajé, believing he
was interviewing Krahô speakers. Snethlage (1926:187 ff.) includes 337 words and
phrases, and Oliveira (1930) includes Apinajé data collected by the author in 1926
(Nimuendajú 1983:7).
Analyses of Apinajé language data were first produced in the sixties, when
missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics started linguistic work with the29ultimate goal of Bible translation. Most of that work followed the phonemic and
tagmemic frameworks (Stout 1960; Ham 1961, 1962, 1965, 1967; Burgess and Ham
1968), with the exception of Callow (1962), which was grounded in Prosodic Theory. In
contrast, work published in the seventies, such as Koopman (1976), Waller (1976) Ham,
Waller and Koopman (1979), presented the data in a more descriptive – and user-friendly
– manner.
More recent studies and publications on the language include Oliveira (1998,
2003) and Salanova (2001).","[42, 43]"

EThe schematic representation in (48) defines possible clauses types according to
the types of arguments that are obligatorily required in each. Thus, a plain transitive
clause must include A and O; a ditransitive clause must include A, O and a third argument,
which may be expressed morphosyntactically as an indirect object E or as a secondary
object O; a plain intransitive has its single argument S; and an extended intransitive has
two obligatory arguments: S plus another, E, which is typically expressed with oblique
markers. Extended arguments differ from oblique participants or adjuncts in that they are
obligatorily required by the verb.
The fact that some of these core arguments will be marked with adpositions or
case-marking certainly makes it hard to decide whether the participant in question is in
fact a core argument of the verb. Thus, as Onishi wisely points out, “both morphological
and syntactic criteria [are necessary] to determine which arguments should be regarded as
A, S, O and E” (p.2).",[245]

O VVerb phrase/clause coordination. Verb phrase coordination basically coincides with
clausal coordination. The strategies employed include the conjunctions ne and um,
which have the additional function of a switch reference system; or simply the
juxtaposition of phrases. The distribution of these markers is also ruled by the contrast
between speech-act and third person participants.
Ne indicates same subject (see discussion of grammatical relations in section 4)
and is used regardless of person distinctions (38.a-b). When there is switch in reference
such that both referents are third person participants, the conjunction um is employed
(38.c). When there is switch of reference to a speech-act participant, however, there is
juxtaposition of clauses such that the second referent is introduced by a free pronoun
(38.d).

possessed by ic-kra in the examples below. Acwj behaves morphosyntactically as an
inalienable noun. It takes person prefixes and may be followed by determiners such as
the definite marker ja. In other words, not only does it belong in the noun phrase, it
heads it (38). The adverbial mne ‘also’, on the other hand, is a sentence-level operator
with rather flexible distribution in the clause, as will be seen later on.
Thus, the strategies presented in (39-40) are not exactly instances of noun phrase,
but clausal coordination. Further details on this subject are in section (4).","[234, 235, 236]"

The declarative, interrogative and imperative speech-acts correspond to morphological
and structural distinctions in Apinajé. Declarative clauses have the structural properties
of the types just introduced.
Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure as
simple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may be
introduced by the positional clitic c (alternative form co, depending on the speaker),
which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b).
Information questions are naturally introduced by interrogative pronouns, also at clause
initial position (45.c-d).(45) a. co

them is the use of an irrealis clause whose nominative participant is the addressee of the
command (46.a). This strategy is employed when the speaker is making a request or
giving advice to the addressee. The other strategy is used in more direct commands, and
that is reflected in the structure of the imperative construction (Haiman 1985; Givón
2001: 34-35). Here, no mode marker is employed. The proposition is expressed, instead,
by the bare or inflected form of the verb, depending on its morphosyntactic class. This is
the only construction type in which a transitive verb may display a nominative pattern of
inflection (i.e., it takes the second person prefix, as one might expect of an imperative
context (46.b)).kaj

Verbal clauses have a structure distinct from nominal ones, not only because they –
obviously – are centered around verbal predicators, but especially because they involve
an interesting combination of alignment patterns (cf. section 4).
In the present discussion, I will be employing the notation A, S, and O, proposed in
Dixon (1979, 1994) and later expanded to include E, in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi’s
(2001) framework. The characterization proposed by Dixon for these symbols, as
representing universal syntactic-semantic primitives, has been critiqued by other
linguists. Some of the problems that have been pointed out include (a) inadequacies in the
semantic characterization of these primitives; (b) the fact that their definition is based on
a mixture of semantic and grammatical properties; and (c) that certain languages do not
seem to follow these kinds of patterning, and therefore such primitives should not be
regarded as universal (Mithun and Chafe 1999; Comrie 1978; 1989). Nonetheless, these
symbols are amply used in the literature as a means to refer to core arguments of
transitive and intransitive verbs.
Keeping in mind the problems raised in the literature regarding the theoretical
implications carried by these symbols, in the present discussion I will use them more as
useful mnemonic devices than as strict theoretical constructs. On the other hand, I will
follow the typology proposed in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi (2001) when laying out
patterns of participant marking noted in Apinajé. Once these patterns have been laid out,
I will propose a set of language internal criteria for identifying what relevant grammatical
relations there are in Apinajé (section 4; cf. Dryer 1997).","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"
"31. The Apinajé people
A distinguishing feature of Jê groups is the contrast between their relatively simple
technology and their highly elaborate social organization. Jê material culture is noted for
basketry techniques, but it does not include, for example, hammocks, canoes or ceramics.
Jê social organization, on the other hand, is characterized by an intricate system of
moieties and men’s groups, rules of proper name transmission, and a relationship
terminology that ignores the generational distinction principle (Da Matta 1982; Carneiro
da Cunha 2004). According to Da Matta’s interpretation, the Apinajé universe is ruled by
a principle of dualism whereby elements at all dimensions are placed in a relation of
complementary opposition thus constituting necessary parts of a closed totality.
Apinajé cosmology, social and physical organization is permeated by this
dualism, which is not as much hierarchical as it is dialectic. This may be observed in the
Apinajé creation myth, according to which all things existing on Earth were created by
Sun and Moon. Sun, the older character, is the initiator, the one who poses a particular,
harmonic state of affairs. Moon, the younger character, is the antithetical element, the
one who questions the order and brings chaos into the status quo. The result of this
interaction is a thesis that justifies the dual aspect of all creation in both nature and
culture. Thus, animals, colors, name sets, ceremonial roles, among other things, are
divided in pairs which are directly associated with either one or the other mythical
character; and the members of each pair stand in a kind of inalienable relationship, for the
existence of one is only justifiable by the existence of the other (Text I, Appendix B).","[16, 17]"
"Periphrastic causative. The periphrastic causative construction encodes indirect
causation; in this context the construction  ane expresses the cause, and a subsequent
clause encodes the result. Unlike languages like English where the causative predicator
takes an embeded complement clause, in the periphrastic causative construction of
Apinajé, the clause encoding the resulting situation is not structurally an embedded
complement, but rather a different-subject clause in a paratactic relation with the clause
that expresses the causation ((92) see chapter V for other complex constructions).",[275]

"2. The Apinajé language
Although the term “Apinajé” and its variants15 have been employed in the literature to
refer to the people and their language, the origin of the term is not known. It is likely that
it was first used by outsiders, since the Apinajé themselves use the term pai to refer to
their own community, and the expression pai kaper, to refer to their language.
However, when speaking in Portuguese of themselves or their language, they
occasionally employ the term Apinajé (or Pinajé [pinaz]), as they have grown
accustomed to its use in interethnic relations.
Other denominations found in reports from previous centuries include Afotigés,
Uhitische, Utonsché, Otogé, and Aogé (Villa Real 1891 [1793], Pohl 1932, Marques
1870, Mattos 1875, cited in Nimuendajú 1983). Curt Nimuendajú suggests that the latter
terms derive from the word ôd, ôdo ‘tip; corner’, and points out that the variants Hôti and
Ahôtiyê used to be employed by the Eastern Timbira to refer to the Apinajé. He further
speculates that the terms may have been a reference to the corner formed at the15This word is also spelled as “Apinayé” in the literature, as first introduced by Curt Nimuendajú. Variants
of the term are Pinarés, Pinajés and Oupinagees.",[40]

Inflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structure
is restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes may
consist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfiniteness
suffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stress
properties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonological
word, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ is
inflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfinite
form in (b).(5) a. ic-pi

they too were affixes at an earlier stage in the development of the language. For instance,
it is possible to identify personal prefixes that have been reanalyzed as part of some
stems, which take productive inflectional morphology at the synchronic level (6).(6) a. kupe

Clitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all of
which display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of the
syllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of the
clause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition as
a whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate the
initial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). The
same is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the
(grammatical) word (9).22As mentioned in footnote 3 of chapter II, throughout this dissertation I will use the symbol “=” to indicate
clitic boundaries, but only in the case of word clitics. Positional (phrase and clause) clitics will be simply86(7) a. pa

prefixes encode first, second, and third persons, that refer to the objects of Postpositions,
the possessor in Nouns, and the absolutive arguments of Verbs. There are three third
person prefixes: ku-, i- and Ø-. The zero prefix is the only one used with all three word
classes. The prefix ku- occurs exclusively with transitive verbs (there is one instance of
ku- with a postposition) and the prefix i-, very marginally, with nouns. The accusative
prefix ku- has further distributional restrictions: it occurs exclusively with the finite form181of verbs, only in monosyllabic stems, and is employed when the accusative noun phrase
is not contiguous to the verb, but elsewhere in the clause (section IV.2.3).
The nonfinite form of a verb performs a more nominal role in the syntax (section
IV.2.1). The set of prefixes employed with nonfinite forms is reduced, as compared tothat of finite verb forms, because only the third person zero prefix (not ku-) may occur.
The third person form i- does not occur very frequently. Although the occurrence
of i- seems to coincide consistently with the absence of a dependent noun phrase
contiguous to the head noun (137), Ø- may also appear in this context (138). It seems,
then, that the use of i- is lexically, rather than phonologically or grammatically,
motivated.(137) a. [[Ken kr] krat] õ

classes. There is a set each of noun, verb and postposition stems that include the
formative i- (sections 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.2.2). The formative ku- does not seem to occur on
postpositions, except – hypothetically – as the source of the suppletive forms found in
some postposition paradigms. The distinction between person prefixes as productive
morphology and i- and ku- as formatives resides in the fact that stems containing either of
these formatives may be inflected for (any) person.
An accusative person prefix is in complementary distribution with its referent
noun phrase, as seen above. The pattern with descriptives seems more like one of
agreement, since both the prefix and an independent pronoun indicate the same referent
in the clause (section IV.2.3); however, it is the prefix that actually encodes the argument
of a descriptive: in casual speech, the independent pronoun may be omitted, but not the
prefix (see chapter IV).","[194, 195, 196]"

content words, though there are instances of echo-vowels in function words too. The
morphemes ket and kot, in (96), are a negative particle and a postposition, respectively.
The fact that these units are prominent within their respective constituents might
be one reason why these function words – and not others – tend to display echo-vowels.
Both particles and postpositions occur phrase-finally and thus have better chances of
appearing in utterance-final position, the locus of echo-vowels.
An independent hypothesis for why ket and kot display a property characteristic of
content words is that both, particle and postposition, must derive historically from content
words – a verb and a noun, respectively (chapter III). The occurrence of echo-vowels
may be one feature that indicates their diachronic origin.","[92, 93]"
"277As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression of
complementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. The
subordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in final
position, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Since
the complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking one
of the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is often
the case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,
when A is the noncanonically marked argument.
The examples in (1.a-d) illustrate the parallel distribution of clausal complements
with that of an O noun phrase. The noun phrase in (1.a) occurs immediately preposed to
the matrix verb (which therefore displays its relational prefix-equivalent form pubu) and
postposed to the dative phrase that indicates the A argument of the verb in question.
In (1.b-c), the subordinate verbs are transitive and intransitive, respectively; the
internal structure of the clausal complement thus reflects this difference in transitivity.
Comparing (1.b) with (1.d), in which both subordinate verbs are transitive, it is possible
to notice the presence of the ergative marker in the latter, but not in the former. The
ergative case marker in (1.d) indicates that the A argument of the subordinate verb is not
coreferential with that of the matrix. The subordinate A arguments is thus overtly
expressed in the embedded clause.(1) a. nai-m [kuke]

verb is slightly different than that of (1). In (1), the matrix verb stem follows a transitive
pattern of inflection, whereas in (2), the matrix verb follows a descriptive pattern of
inflection. That is, in (2), the first argument of the matrix verb is indicated by both an
independent pronoun (when it occurs) and the person prefix attached to the verb. In its
turn, the dative marker attaches to the constituent that refers to the (noncanonically
marked) O argument of the verb in question. When that constituent is a clausal
complement, the dative marker follows the final boundary of the subordinate clause.","[290, 291, 292]"
"4.7.1. Imperatives
In his typology, Onishi (2001) points out that non-canonically marked A/S tend not to
occur in languages where only second person A/S is allowed in imperative constructions,
since they refer to non-controllers; but that they seem to occur marginally in this type of
construction, in head marking languages.
In Apinajé, many noncanonical predicates can be found in the imperative of
command; these are presented in (100-102) below.(100) a. kja-m kaga

Different types of noncanonically marked arguments may behave differently even within
the same language, with respect to control over reflexives. In Hindi-Urdu, for instance,
dative, genitive and locative arguments control reflexivization, but instrumentals do not
(Onishi 2001).
In Apinajé, noncanonical predicates of the set presented in ((49) section 3.3.1) do
not allow reflexivization (103), which means that these are really monovalent predicates,
and not predicates that involve third-person impersonal verb forms.","[282, 283]"

gob.ma,Postpositional phrase coordination. The coordination of postpositional phrases seems
more restricted in possibilities than plain noun phrase coordination. The conjunction
used is the associative marker me. The examples in (29) show structural distinctions that
have to do with whether one of the coordinates is a speech-act participant. If so, it will be
expressed as a person prefix on the postposition, which results in non-contiguity between
the (notional) coordinates, since the two nominal elements are separated by the217associative and the dual marker (29.a). That is not exactly what could be called
coordination, though the combination of dual marker and first person prefix encodes first
person exclusive, and the other participant is clearly indicated by the associative marker
me. In (29.b), on the other hand, the two third person objects are expressed by overt noun
phrases linked by the associative marker.(29) a. ktkaj

[Lit.: ‘Sirac, towards the village and the field, in both places she lives/wanders.’]The unacceptable examples in (30) show that the presence of the dual marker wa
is necessary, and that it mediates the relation between the coordinate noun phrases and
the postposition that heads the higher phrase. In other words, there is no coordination of
postpositional phrases as such; instead, there is either noun phrase or clause coordination
