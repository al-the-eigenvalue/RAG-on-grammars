"4. 1 COREGRAMMAR ANDGRAMMATlCALRELATIONS
The basic word order of an Abun clause, like all other West Papuan Phylum languages, is
SUBJECT VERB OBJECT.
Firstly, in regard to subjects, Andrews ( 1 985: 1 04) points out that in a great many
languages a subject grammatical relation is clearly marked by the coding features of ordinary
main clauses. For example, in English, subjects are primari ly marked by the coding feature
of preverbal position, and in some limited cases indicated by case marking and cross­
referencing. Abun subjects are similar to English because they are clearly encoded by word
order. No case-marking or other coding devices signify an Abun subject. Rather, Abun
subjects are always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately precedes the
verb.
The direct object in an Abun transitive clause is also encoded by word order alone. The
Abun object is always the constituent realised by a noun phrase that immediately follows the
verb, except in certain contexts where the object can be fronted (see §4.7.2).
According to Andrews ( 1 985:69), the first step in analysing the system of grammatical
relations in a language is to identify A, S, and 0, where A is transitive subject (prototypically
an agent), S is intransitive subject (either agent or patient) and 0 is transitive object
(prototypically a patient). Typologically languages differ according to how these grammatical
relations group. Nominative/accusative systems combine A and S functions, whereas
absolutive/ergative systems combine S and 0 functions.
On this basis, Abun is a nominative-accusative language since it combines the S and A
functions. Abun combines S and A on a syntactic level, the syntactic coding being word
order. S and A precede the verb, whereas 0 follows the verb. In an intransitive clause, a4849ClAUSE STRUCTUREsubject (S) precedes the verb, as in example 4. 1 . The same is true for a transitive clause, the
subject (A) precedes the verb and an object (0) fol lows, as in 4.2.","[60, 61]"
"172CHAPTER 1010.2.4 COMPLEMENT CLAUSE STRUCI1JRE IN ABUN
When a subordinate clause is a complement, it is common for the complement to function
as the subject or object of the larger clause into which it is embedded. In Abun , complements
may function as objects of a clause and this type of complement will be described under
§ 1 O.3. However, the type of subordinate clause that has been under discussion here, those
that are identified by the complementiser do, do not function in this way.
At this stage it may be relevant to restate the criteria that determines which constituent i s
the object i n a n Abun clause. A s stated i n §4. 1 , ""The direct object in a n Abun transitive
clause is also encoded by word order alone. Abun objects are always the constituent realised
by a noun phrase that immediately follows the verb . . . "" Since there is no case marking on
nouns, this cannot be used to identify the object. The rigid word order of the Abun language
does not allow passivisation and so this cannot serve to identify the object either. Unlike the
dative relation the object is not identified by a particular preposition. The object i s
distinguished from the subject o n the sole criteria o f word order.
When the complementiser is used, the constituent that follows the complementiser does
not function as the direct object of the main clause. Three arguments are put forward here to
support this analysis:(1)
(2)
(3)A do-clause can follow an intransitive verb.
When the verb is transitive a do-clause can co-occur with the direct object.
Abun word order indicates that a do-clause functions as an oblique.","[183, 184]"
"CHAPTER 450
4.2 ABUN AND lHE GRAMMATICAL RElATIONS HJERARONBlake ( 1 990: 1 ) summarises some of the basic notions of relational grammar and includes
a discussion of grammatical relations that can be arranged in a hierarchy, namely subject,
object, indirect object and obliques (that is, adjuncts). Each level of the hierarchy can be
distinctly marked; for example, the presence of case marking or adpositions tends to be
associated with the oblique end of the hierarchy.
In arranging the grammatical relations of the Abun language in a hierarchy, it can be seen
that each level is marked in a distinct way, as listed in Table 3 . 1 8 below. First, the subject is
marked by word order; it is simply preverbal. Second, the object also is marked by word
order; it is postverbal. Next, at the level of indirect object, a change in marking takes place.
Higher in the hierarchy, word order alone marks the grammatical relations, but for indirect
objects and obliques grammatical relations are marked by prepositions, with word order
taking a secondary role.","[61, 62]"
"CHAPTER S
PHRASE STRUCTUREThe structure of phrases in Abun is consistent with what has already been stated about its
syntax; namely that fixed word order and particles, rather than affixation, are used to signify
meaning.
This chapter consists of a survey of phrase types, namely verb phrases (§5 . 1 ), noun
phrases (§5.2), possessive phrases (§5.3), prepositional phrases (§5.4), adverbial and
adjectival phrases (§5.5), quantifier phrases (§5 .6) and complex phrases (§5.7). The head of
each phrase type is indicated by word order, and word order alone. Table 5 . 1 below
summarises the structure of each of these phrase types.","[76, 77]"
"10.2.4.3 THE dO-ClAUSE MAY rou.ow AN INDIRECT OBJECT OR A PRFPOSmONAL PHRASE
Abun word order is such that if there is a prepositional phrase then this follows the
indirect object and is the final constituent of the clause. If the clause contains no prepositional
phrase then the indirect object is the final constituent. In example 10.44 below the do-clause
occurs after an indirect object. Since in Abun a direct object never follows an indirect object,
it is not possible that the do-clause of this example could be considered to function as the
object of the main clause.",[186]
"25MORPHOWGYAND WORD ClASSESHoney ( 1 972: 277) makes the point that ""the object of the grammarian i s to establish
categories of words which are most efficient for enabling him to make the most
comprehensive and, at the same time, the simplest grammatical statements . . . "". Honey
developed systematic syntactic statements whereby he established his system of word classes
for Vietnamese (which is also an analytical language like Abun) on the basis of positional
relationships of certain selected words and/or classes of words. Some of his methods have
been applied in order to establish a set of word classes for Abun.
The word classes in Abun have been divided into open and closed classes. Open classes
of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs have a membership that is in principle unlimi ted.
Closed classes, which in Abun are noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conj unctions, proforms,
particles and interjections, have a fixed and generally small number of words.","[36, 37]"

OBJECfMost other grammatical relations, including that of dative, are encoded by the use of
prepositions. In addition to being encoded by prepositions, word order is stil l fairly rigid. For
example, dative, where present, follows an object and precedes other prepositional phrases .
Locative phrases with the preposition m o usually fol low a l l other prepositional phrases.
Free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases which express time or location are free from the
otherwise rigid word order of the Abun clause, with the exception that they cannot occur
preceding the direct object (see §4.4. 1 ).
Thus, an Abun main clause consists of:
(ADJUNCTS) SUBJECf VERB (DIRECr OBJECf) (INDIRECr OBJECf) (ADJUNCTS) (PARTICLES)
Adj uncts include free-form adverbs or adverbial phrases and various prepositional phrases
expressing associative, instrumental, benefactive and the like. The subject is obligatory and i s
rarely elided, even in subordinate clauses. Particles may optionally occur clause-finally to
indicate polarity, aspect, modality or mood. A detailed discussion of these particles is the
subject of the chapters 6, 7 and 8 of this work.
Objects may be topicalised by fronting. Adj uncts expressing location or time may also be
fronted and thereby precede the subject in certain contexts (see §4.7 below). Those
expressing time usually precede the subject, whereas those expressing location are only
fronted on rare occasions.",[61]

NEG131CHAPTER 81 32In the above example the predicate ma mo nu is bracketed by the linked pair of particles,
yo follows the subject and precedes the predicate, and nde follows the predicate. If, for
example, the subject of a negative indicative sentence is preceded by yo, this would be
syntactically unacceptable to an Abun speaker. Word order here is rigid. The particles must
bracket the whole predicate, PRED (includes v, 0 and any adj uncts). The subject is never
included within the bracket for reasons discussed under the scope of negation in § 8 . 5 .
There are two patterns o f negation found in Abun a s follows:S PRED nde
syo PRED nde
They are unusual and have been documented in only a few languages. In SVo languages
the negative particle normal ly precedes the verb (Payne 1985b:224). One would expect the
particle nde to be preverbal, but instead, in Abun, it is not only postverbal but also postobject
and adjunct. This pattern type, though uncommon, is also found in a few documented
languages such as Bolewa, Ngizim, Angas, Ron, Gisiga, Higi and Tera (Payne 1 985b:226).
Furthermore the second pattern type, where a pair of linked negative particles occur, is
also uncommon. In French a linked pair of particles is used in negation, but this pair brackets
only the verb and its associated clitics, whereas in Abun the linked pair brackets the whole
predicate including object and adjuncts. However, this pattern type is an attested one in some
Chadic languages such as Hausa, Jegu and Sura (Payne 1 985b: 225-226). The difference
with these languages is that their word order is not rigid as in Abun. In Hausa both particles
can move to bracket the constituent that is to be negated, and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope and focus of negation (Schachter 1985:60).
Syntax of negation involving the use ,of nde (§ 8. 1 ), the use of yo (§8 .2), negation in
subordinate clauses (§8.3), negation in words (§8 .4) and a discussion of the scope of
negation in Abun (§8.5) provides an organising framework for the remainder of this chapter.","[143, 144]"
"27
28An alternative analysis is that these are treated as serial verbs.
It could be stated that the fact that subjectless constituents do not exist elsewhere in the language
does not in itself represent an argument that they do not exist in the constructions shown here. It
needs to be pointed out that in Abun there is not sufficient syntactic evidence to posit that a
subjectless subordinate clause exists as a real constituent in the language, either in these cases or
anywhere else. The only reason for positing that such a constituent may exist here is not due to
syntactic evidence but rather to accommodate a certain theoretical position. In order to master a
second language properly the language learner must not only master vocabulary but also master the
syntactic patterns that are found in the language. In order to speak Abun effectively it is not
necessary to include in one's inventory of syntactic patterns a reduced clause of this kind. It seems
strange to add to the list of Abun clause types a reduced clause which does not have any specific
syntactic marking to indicate its separate existence. This raises the question of whether certain
clause types should be added to the language' s inventory when the only basis for doing so is
theoretical rather than observed syntactic evidence.",[196]

NEGIn a similar way the Chadic language, Hausa, syntactically marks the scope of negation by
the use of two negative particles. In that language these particles can move around to bracket
the subject, the predicate or other parts of the sentence. Examples are found in Schachter
( 1 985 :60). However word order is not rigid as it is in Abun. In Hausa, both particles can
move to bracket the constituent that is being negated and thereby very neatly indicate the
scope as well as the focus of negation. Abun ' s use of the linked particles is not as flexible:
because for example, the subject can never be surrounded by the linked pair of particles.
However the subject may be included in the scope of negation as discussed in the next
section.",[155]
"3.4.5 PARTICLES
There are several subclasses of particles including a topicaliser particle, a particle used for
negation, three aspect, three modal and eight mood particles. The term particle is used to
mean a free form word that does not take any type of inflection. It is an invariant form that
never occurs in an environment where i t could be described as 'bound' .
The topicaliser or focus particle is ana(to), which always occurs after the subject and
before the verb. See §4.7.2 for more details about the use of this particle.
There is one negative particle, nde, which occurs after the predicate and before aspect
mood or modal particles. Used on its own it may answer a question in the negative. To form
the indicative negative this particle along with the predicate marker yo form a linked pair of
particles. These particles jointly bracket the constituent 'predicate' . Used in a sentence without
yo, nde makes the mood of the sentence prohibitive. For further details see §8.
If a clause includes aspect, modal or mood particles, those particles will always be in
clause-final position in that order. The particles may occur after either the verb, the object, the
indirect object or an adjunct, depending on the constituents of the particular clause concerned.
Also, these particles are not clitics in that the particle takes equivalent phonological stress
along with every other word in the clause.",[57]
"4CHAPTER 11.5.2 PAPUAN VERSUS AUS1RONESIAN FFATURfS OFTIIE AEUN LANGUAGE
Wurm's classification of Abun as a Papuan language seems to be based mainly on its
lexical inventory, with special reference to its set of personal pronouns. There are a
considerable number of Austronesian loan words in the West Papuan (WP) Phylum
languages, and when only non-Austronesian lexical items are compared, the lexical
interrelationship between the WPP languages is much closer. WPP languages in the Bird's
Head contain a small Trans New Guinea (TNG) Phylum lexical element, some of which
may be due to borrowing from the South Bird's Head Stock (which is part of the TNG
Phylum), or may be traces of an old TNG Phylum substratum (Wurm 1 982:204). The
personal pronouns are clearly Papuan, belonging to Wurm's set III (Wurm 1 982:40). Abun
personal pronouns do not distinguish between first person plural inclusive and exclusive,
whereas this is universal for Austronesian languages. Neither are there bound subject
markers on the verb, which is a feature of Austronesian languages. Thus Abun' s pronouns
are more akin to Papuan languages than to Austronesian languages.
Other Papuan (or perhaps non-Austronesian) features include: no bound subject markers
on the verb, phonologically relevant tone and an irrealis-realis (or non-pasUpast) distinction
which is marked only on complex sentences. Perhaps the most striking Papuan features of
Abun syntax are found at the level of the complex sentence. In some Abun complex
sentences there is no clear syntactic marking to distinguish those clauses which could be
considered subordinate from those which might be termed coordinate. This lack of
subordinate/coordinate distinction is found in Papuan clause-chaining languages. Likewise, in
Papuan clause-chaining languages the semantic notions of temporal sequence and
simultaneity are strongly marked (Longacre 1985:264). These notions also feature strongly in
Abun complex sentences.
However, Abun has a number of Austronesian features. Most notable is the rigid word
order of svo as distinct from the Papuan SOY word order (Wurm 1 982:64). Other significant
Austronesian features include: a very simple derivational morphology; uncomplicated and
very little inflectional affixation; the common use of particles where verb affixation would be
used in Papuan languages; the use of prepositions instead of postpositions or case marking;
no special sentence-medial verbs; a decimal numbering system unlike the normal Papuan
binary, trinary or quinary systems (Wurm 1 982:64); the existence of reduplicated adverbs;
simple morphophonemic changes and the common use of labialised consonants.
Despite these features which could make it appear that grammatically Abun has more in
common with Austronesian languages, Abun has some unique features which distinguish it
from both Papuan and Austronesian languages. The use of particles in Abun is so extensive
that it is far greater than in Austronesian languages such as Indonesian. Particles are the main
means of grammatical communication, with affixation playing an extremely minor role. Due
to the lack of affixation in Abun syntax, other grammatical strategies have been developed. In
particular, the use of bracketing (whereby two particles act as boundary markers for a
particular grammatical constituent) serves to identify some important grammatical features,
namely negation, interrogatives and relative clauses. Therefore, Abun does not neatly fit into
either of the neighbouring language classifications, that is Austronesian or Papuan, but shares
features of both.","[15, 16]"
"2324CHAPTER 3The second index that Comrie discusses is the index of fusion, which measures the extent
to which morphemes within the word are readily segmentable, with the extremes being
agglutination and fusion. The few affixes which occur in Abun are easily segmentable. There
is some slight variability of morpheme shape predictable in terms of general phonological
rules discussed in §2.5. Abun, then, has an agglutinating morphology within its relatively
small amount of polymorpherruc words. Very little fusion is evident.
Comrie ( 1 989:46ff.) discusses several languages in relation to the index of fusion
including Turkish, Hungarian and Russian. Turkish is relatively agglutinating, Hungarian
exhibits more fusion, and Russian even more fusion again. Abun, however, is more like
Turkish in that it is close to the agglutinating end of the continuum.
Therefore, Abun is an isolating language, mostly monosyllabic. In the few cases of
affixation and word compounding that do occur, the morphemes are easily segmentable.
The implications of very little affixation in Abun are that other strategies are required to
effect what is normally achieved through affixation. For example, in many languages
affixation on the head of a noun phrase defines grammatical relations. However, in Abun,
word order alone defines core grammatical relations, while prepositions are used with
obliques. Number is expressed with a classifier and a number word, rather than an affix.
Possession is not marked with an affix, but instead a linker is used between the possessor
and the possessum.
Very little affixation occurs on Abun verbs. Instead of person/number agreement affixes
on verbs, only free form pronouns are used. While other languages in the West Papuan
Phylum have both free pronorrunal forms and person/number prefixes on verbs, including
the most closely related language, Maibrat, Abun does not. Time adverbs, temporal
prepositional phrases and some conjunctions indicate notions of time normally carried by
tense affixes. Polarity, aspect, mood and modality are conveyed by the use of particles, not
by affixation on verbs as is common in Papuan languages (Foley 1 986).
The processes of word-building in Abun are therefore rather lirruted. The following
processes are evident: lirruted suffixation on verbs (§3 . 3 . 1 ) ; three prefixes for nouns (§3.3.2);
word compounding, principally in nouns (§3.3 .2); and some adjectives are used as manner
adverbs (§3.3.3 and §3.3 .4).","[35, 36]"
"1 1 .2.3 CONSTITUENT STATUS OF Sa ANDyo
When both of these 'tensed' conjunctions mark a sentence they modify the first clause of
the sentence only. Thus these sentences have the following structure:[CLAUSE 1 + sa / yo] + CLAUSE 2
Because a single clause cannot be modified by a grammatical category 'tense ' , sa and yo
are considered subordinating conjunctions. These 'tensed' conjunctions behave differently to
other Abun conjunctions in that they are postpositional. Prepositional and compounding
conjunctions such as we 'because ' and wo 'but' do not behave this way. This is to be
expected since Abun is a language with svo word order and has prepositions. The 'tensed' or
temporal conjunctions sa and yo depart from this. In fact in vo word-order languages
generally ""the connecting morpheme appears clause-initially
in the following clause""
(Givon 1 990:889). These conjunctions being postpositional illustrate characteristics often
found in ov languages. Because these two conjunctions show a difference in syntactic
behaviour to other Abun conjunctions they are considered to be in a separate subclass to the
others.
-The two final examples show clearly that while both conjunctions have several meanings
in Abun, the predominant meaning is to give a time setting to the sentences concerned. The
first clause of each sentence is almost identical to the other except for the choice of
conjunction. The meaning difference is that the events expressed by example 1 1 .36 had at
that stage not yet taken place (being in the middle of a narrative); whereas sentence 1 1 .37
(given earlier as example 1 1 .20) expresses events already concluded and is in fact a
summary statement at the end of the same narrative. Therefore it is by the means of two
subordinating conjunctions that hearers can identify the time settings of Abun sentences.",[213]
"153RELATNE CLAUSES9.5. 1 THE ROLE OF mE DETERMINER
It was said in §9. 1 above that some restncl1ve relative clauses are closed with a
determiner. The demonstrative pronouns re 'this' and ne 'that' have several functions in
Abun and one of these is to behave as a determiner. Unlike English determiner usage it is not
obligatory to use the determiner after a noun in Abun.
What factors govern the use of the determiner in the relative clause? It is not found in
every instance of a restrictive relative clause. Example 9.22 above has no determiner, in
contrast to example 9.23, in which the restrictive relative clause is closed by the determiner
ne. These two examples differ in two ways. Firstly, in example 9.22 the relativised argument
of the clause has the grammatical relation of subject. In 9.23 the relativised argument has the
grammatical relation of object. Secondly, due to Abun word order the location of the gap in
each restricting clause is different. In example 9.22 the gap is clause-initial since the subject in
Abun is clause-initial. In 9.23 the gap would have been clause-final if the determiner had not
closed the restricting clause. The determiner, by closing the clause, actually assists in locating
the gap, and thereby assists in encoding the grammatical relation of the head.
The determiner's role in locating the gap is most clearly seen when a direct object is to be
relativised. The determiner ne is used frequently when a direct object is to be relativised, but
not in all instances. To understand how the determiner is used in locating the gap in the
restricting clause, several examples are set out below. In example 9.24 to 9.27 both the head
and the relative conjunction have been highlighted. Further elements within the restricting
clause are underlined to show where the determiner has been omitted. Example 9.24 shows
the determiner as it normally appears, at the end of the relative clause.","[164, 165]"
"9.5.2 ABUN RELATIVEClAUSES ANDTHE ACCESSIBILITY H1ERARCHY
Keenan and Comrie ( 1 977) in their work on relative clauses devised a hierarchy they
called the Accessibility Hierarchy which summarised their findings across a wide sample of
languages. They had investigated the types of constraints across languages on which
grammatical relations could be relativised. Comrie ( 1 989: 1 56) later refined this hierarchy so
that ""The hierarchy subject > direct object > non-direct object > possessor defines ease of
accessibility to relative clause formation"". He stated that ( 1 989: 1 56): ""if a language can form
relative clauses on a given position on the hierarchy, it can also form relative clauses on all
positions higher (to the left) on the hierarchy"".
How do Abun relative clauses compare to this hierarchy? Does this hierarchy hold true
for Abun? In §9.5 . 1 above, several examples were given which showed that various
positions along the hierarchy could be relativised. In fact in Abun all positions on Comrie's
Accessibility Hierarchy can be relativised.
Keenan ( 1 985 : 1 56), when referring to the different strategies that a language may use to
form relative clauses, noted that ""pronoun retaining strategies are (a) more effective means of
forming RCS (restrictive relative clauses) than RPRO (relative pronoun) or gapping strategies"",14
15Probably the formula should contain ± OBJECT, but n o examples with a n object occur i n the corpus
of data.
It i s our experience i n living among Abun speakers that such errors that Giv6n imagines rarely arise.
Because word order is the main means of encoding grammatical relations, there are very strong
internal expectations in the mind of the hearer. These expectations are not necessary for languages
which use case marking or affixation for deriving meaning. The device of the boundary marker is
strongly used throughout Abun grammar to assist hearers in encoding meaning. It is used in
negative constructions and in interrogatives. Here, also, the dual particles involved could be
considered as 'bracketing' devices. These are discussed more fully Chapters 6 and 8.",[167]
"In order for negative raising to take place as has been attempted in example l O.47 , only
one negative particle, -yo-, will move in order to negate the matrix verb nut 'think' . Due to
the structure and word order of complex negative constructions in Abun it is not possible to
shift the second negative particle nde and retain a grammatical sentence. Abun rules of word
order do not allow this. Normally in languages that allow negative raising the means of
negation is syntactically removed from the subordinate clause and 'raised' into the main
clause. Because Abun negation involves the use of two particles, both of these cannot be
'raised' from the complement clause. This structural limitation shows that negative raising is
not possible in Abun.lO.3 EMBEDDED COMPLEMENTS
The second type of complement to be found in Abun does not make use of the
complementiser. For want of a better label we have called these complements 'embedded' .
There are mainly two types of predicate which do not need to have a complementiser: those
which involve desiderative or attitudinal predicates and those which involve some type of
force, that is a manipulative predicate. These semantic distinctions are illustrated by the type
of verb suffix used. Attitudinal predicates make use of the suffix -wa, while those indicating
some sort of force or pressure (manipulative) use -gat. Examples of these verb types which
do not use a complementiser are fwa 'want' , bariwa 'not.want/dislike', nyuwa 'fear' and
nokwa 'worry about' , all being attitudinal predicates, and wergat 'persuade/pressurise' and
krokgat 'annoy/stir up' being manipulative predicates. Other manipulative predicates will be
discussed later in the chapter.
The following examples illustrate these complement types:

RELATIVE CLAUSESIn this section subordinate clauses of the type known as relative clauses will be discussed.
In Abun, relative clauses can be divided into the two basic types, restrictive and non­
restrictive. The restrictive type is by far the more common and more flexible grammatical
structure and so it will be discussed in more detail here. This discussion will attempt to show
that the Abun relative clause utilises a relative conjunction together with a strategy called a
gap strategy, in order to relati vise various grammatical relations.
By using a different conjunction, a non-restrictive relative clause as well as a third type
which could be described as an indefinite relative clause are also possible in the Abun
language. These will be described in detail below.","[157, 158]"

"10.2.4.2 THEdo-cLAUSE MAY FOlLOW A DIRECr OBJECT
In a simple clause, constituents that may follow the direct object are the indirect object and

The embedded clause of example 10.40 is in apposition to the object suk 'thjng' . It is an
expansion of the object or gives clear content to it. It is certrunly not common to have a
structure as ful l as this, but 1 0.40 shows that if there is a do-clause it occurs after the object
and indirect object, if these constituents are present. In 1 0.40 the object, here suk 'thjng', is a
generic non-specific noun without any known or specific content until the do-clause is given.
Because the do-clause is a more internally complex constituent than a single noun such as
suk, the placing of the do-clause in sentence-final position, rather than immediately following
the object, is an example of the heavy-to-the-right movement principle. This principle of
word order, evident in many languages, shifts larger complex units to the right, that is
towards the end of the sentence, to reduce burden on the short-term memory (Mallinson &

constituent within the sentence in addition to the direct object, the pronoun ji ' l sG ' . In 1 0.74,
however, the entire embedded complement clause is the object. In this case no
complementiser is used since a complementiser is used only when the complement clause is

gap within the relative clause when the gap occurs in a clause-final position. Usually it is by
word order that the gap is located within the restricting clause. Since the determiner acts to
close the clause like some kind of boundary marker then it is still possible to locate the gap in
these situations. Giv6n ( 1990:659-660) stated that the gap strategy is most commonly found
in languages with rigid word order, as is the case with Abun. However, he felt that
""processing rate"" would be longer in such languages as well as ""increased error rate, and
increased dependence on context"" (Giv6n 1 990:660ff). If there were no boundary marker, it
would not be fully clear where the gap was and such 'increased errors' as Giv6n describes
could arise. B ut the device of a boundary marker behaves as another means for hearers to
correctly encode what they hear. Together with the relative conjunction gato, the determiner
'brackets' the relative clause. l s There are some instances where some speakers will use ne to
close the relative clause even though the gap is not clause-final. It may be that they want to
add extra certainty that the relative clause is in fact closed and this is made more evident by
the 'bracketing' nature of the determiner.","[166, 167]"
"1 87COMPLEMENT ClAUSES10.4. 1 MANIPUlATIVE PREDICATES
There are two manipulative predicates which when they take a complement clause may be
with or without the complementiser. These are syogat 'order' and syaugat 'command

Erensi deceived the child into going (away).
It appears that only a small number of predicates may behave this way, exhibiting two
distinct structural possibilities. As the above examples illustrate, there appear to be certain
restrictions which limit the number of predicates capable of doing this. One restriction limits
predicates to those that are transitive. Any intransitive verb can occur only with the
complementiser present. The second restriction appears to be one of co-referentiality. Givan
( 1 993: 1 5) describes the sharing of referents across contiguous clauses and tenns this
'referential continuity' . In describing co-reference limitations for English complement
clauses he notes ( 1 993 : 1 6) that ""The subject of the complement of a modality verb must be
co-referential with the subject of the main verb and the subject of the complement of a
manipulative verb must be co-referential with the object of the main verb"" [italics his]. In
Abun, co-reference restrictions also apply but are somewhat different to those which Givan
has described for English. In Abun, if these predicates can take both an object and
complement constituent then there needs to be agreement between the object and the
complement constituent. In three of the above examples, 1 0.73, 1 0.75 and 1 0.77, the object
of the predicate is co-referential with the subject of the complement clause. In all of these
cases the subject of the complement clause is replaced by a pronoun which agrees in number
and person with the object of the matrix clause. However, example 1 0.79 shows a pretence
predicate which varies in that the subject of the complement clause agrees with the subject of
the main clause predicate. Here again a pronoun is used to indicate agreement. The means of
pronominal reference to the subject of the complement clause is typical of all cases where
these two constituents are co-referential. Unlike English, where only in manipulative
predicates does the object of the predicate agree with the subject of the complement, as
shown in Table 10. 1 , this restriction is shared by other predicate types. 29 Therefore it appears
that if a particular predicate can take complements both with and without a complementiser
then co-reference restrictions operate.
10.4.4 KNOWLEDGE PREDICATES
The predicate jam 'knowlhear/understand' also may be considered a Type 3 predicate in
that it may occur with or without a complementiser. However, this verb is structurally
different in that it does not have an object immediately preceding the complement clause
constituent, as is the case with the other Type 3 predicates. If jam has the meaning 'know ' it
is more likely to use the complementiser in conjunction with the complement clause. If jam29In particular predicates such as 'know' , 'lie' and 'call' which Giv6n terms 'Perception-Cognition­
Utterance' predicates 'no co-reference with any argument in the main clause' is required in English
(Giv6n 1 993: 1 6).",[200]
"IICHAPTER 9152
9.5 RELATIVECLAUSE FDRMAnON STRAlEGYIn any relative construction, the noun phrase that is denoted 'head' holds a gramm atical
relation in both clauses of that construction, namely in the main clause and in the relative
clause. Cross-linguistically, it appears that there is more significant variation in encoding the
grammatical relation of the head in the embedded clause, than is found in the main clause
(Comrie 1 989: 147, 1 53). Comrie distinguishes four major strategies for encoding the head
within the relative clause. These he terms non-reduction, pronoun retention, relative pronoun
and gap (Comrie 1989: 147). Non-reduction means ""that the head noun appears in full,
unreduced form, in the embedded sentence, in the normal position and/or with the normal
case marking"". With pronoun retention, the head noun is represented in the embedded clause
as a pronoun. When a relative pronoun is used, it is in clause-initial position and it is marked
for case. With any of these three strategies the role of the head noun within the relative clause
is overtly indicated ( 1 989 : 1 5 1 ). The fourth strategy, however, does not provide any overt
indication at all of the role of the head within the relative clause. The head is actually omitted
from the relative clause. For this reason it is called a gap strategy. A study of Abun relative
clause structure shows that Abun uses the fourth strategy in Comrie' s list, the gap strategy.
Abun does not make any overt reference to the head noun within the restricting clause.
The embedded clause does not retain a pronoun referring to the head noun, nor is there a
relative clause pronoun which specifically refers to the head noun, nor is there a full noun
phrase inside the embedded clause. The head is omitted in the restricting clause, thereby
creating a gap. But since the restricting clause does not contain any reference to the head
noun, how can one know what grammatical relation the relativised argument holds?
As explained in Chapter 4, Abun does not actually mark the case of nouns. The
gramm atical relations of Subject, Object and so on are normally marked by word order.
Therefore, it is the word order of the relative clause and the location of the gap created by the
omission of the head that provide the clues for encoding the gramm atical relation of the head.
For example:
9.22M e mu gu y e
gato man siri
su
men bi
nggon.
I PL go kill person RFL do wrong with I PL POSS woman
We (will) go (and) kill the person who has slept with our woman (woman

"Modifiers are optional. The types, their order and co-occurrence restrictions are discussed
below in §5.2. 1 .
Determiners, like modifiers, are optional. They are used less frequently than determiners
are in English. They will be discussed in §5.2.2 below.
Since modifiers and determiners are optional, frequently a noun phrase consists of a single
noun. For example:5.13Fredikbari-wayetu.gitFredik not.want-TRs eat people
Fredik does not want to eat people.
Noun phrases fill subject and object positions, as seen in the examples below. They also
fill head positions in possessive and prepositional phrases and these will be discussed in §5.3
and §5.4 respectively.

1 . People call it the sacred house, the house that must not be seen.
2. People call it the sacred house, that people must not see the form of it.
In all these examples, although they represent relativisations of a direct object, the
determiner has not been used. The word order is sufficient to locate the gap, created by the
omission of the head, since prepositional phrases must always follow a direct object. In these
cases the gap is not clause-final and there is no need to indicate the boundary of the restricting
clause. Therefore, whenever there is an adjunct or complement of some kind within the
structure of the restricting clause, the determiner does not need to be used. So a relativisation
of the direct object may have the following composition:HEAD+ gata +SUBJ+ VERB+GAP+DET
OR
+GAP+ADJUNCT/COMPLEMENT
+
+
HEAD+ gata SUBJ VERB
The same situation is evident when a non-direct object is being relativised. In example9.28 below, the preposition su 'with' indicates a prepositional phrase. The gap is indicated by
the presence of the preposition without the noun which normally accompanies it. Although
the gap here is clause-final it is part of the prepositional phrase. Part of the phrase is present,
so it is not necessary to use ne since there is another means through which the location of the
gap may be encoded.",[166]

In both these examples there are several clauses where the subject was omitted. In both
cases the omitted subject was not in the immediate context of the clauses concerned. The
omitted subject was given several clauses earlier. In example 1 0.69 the omitted subject
'people' was given only two clauses preceding. However, in example 1 0.70 the omitted
subject is 'eel' and is given four clauses prior to the first which takes 'eel' as its subject. It
can be seen that in Abun omitted subjects occur only in certain types of narrative, particularly
where these subjects have several actions attributed to them. In these instances the subjects
are omitted from either simple clauses or coordinate clauses. These clauses are not
subjectless embedded clauses.2 7
On this basis it is concluded that a subjectless subordinate clause is not a valid clause type
in Abun. A sentence having the constituent division SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT is quite common
in Abun. However, a sentence which has the constituent division
SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT + (VERB + OBJECT)
is not. 28 In the above the embedded clause is subjectless.
There are languages such as English which allow fronting of subordinate clauses.
Frequently, when a subordinate clause is fronted it consists of verb and object only.
However, in Abun it is not possible to front any subordinate or embedded clause. Since
fronting is not possible this cannot be used as a test of subordination.","[195, 196]"

CLAUSE STRUCTUREThe focus of thjs chapter is the structure of an Abun main clause. Firstly, some comments
are made about the core grammar and grammatical relations (§4. 1 ) followed by a note on
how the grammatical relations hierarchy relates to Abun (§4.2). A discussion of clause types
(§4.3), peripheral constituents, which are labelled here adjuncts (§4.4), and clause-final
particles (§4.S) completes the picture of the Abun verbal main clause. In §4.6, Abun verbless
clauses are djscussed.
A feature of Abun clauses is their fairly rigid word order, especially in the core, but also in
the periphery. The acceptable variations are limited. There are several syntactic information­
packaging options in Abun clauses such as de-focusing, topicalisation and cleft-like
constructions, which are discussed in §4.7.","[59, 60]"

"10.4 ADDITIONAL POSSmll...ITIES
So far two types of complement have been described, those that use the complementiser
and those that do not. There are certain predicates which, when they take a complement, do
so only by using the complementiser. We would like to call this type of predicate Type l .
Then there are a small number of predicates where n o complementiser i s used and the
complement clause is an embedded object. We would like to call this type of predicate Type
2. Then there is another type of predicate (Type 3), which is able to take complement clauses
of both types that is with and without the complementiser. Table 10. 1 below lists these three
predicate types:CHAPTER 101 86TABLE 10. 1 : PREDlCA1ETYPES

following structure:SUBJECT + PREDICATE 1 + (OBJECT) + (INDIRECT OBJECT) + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
This type of predicate can have a maximum valency of three, if the complement clause is
considered in apposition to the direct object.
Sentences which take predicates termed Type 2 have been analysed as fol lows:SUBJECT + PREDICA1E 2 + COMPLEMENT CLAUSE AS OBJECT
This type of predicate has a valency of only two.
Sentences which take predicates termed Type 3 have two possible representations:SUBJECT + PREDICA1E 3 + OBJECT + (do) + (COMPLEMENT CLAUSE)
CRSUBJECT + PREDICA1E 3 + COMPLEMENT CLAUSE AS OBJECT
Again if the complement clause is considered to be in apposition to the direct object like
those of Type 2, these predicates have a valency of only two but the sentence contains an
additional constituent. In the alternative structure the sentence is identical to that for predicate
Type 2.
Examples of predicates of this third type are given below showing both possibilities, with
and without the complementiser do.","[197, 198]"
"CHAPTER 101 82Because the clauses of the type similar to that of example 1 0.63 function as objects, they
must be understood as complements even though no complementisers are used. These
clauses are therefore embedded clauses.
The other types of verb under consideration here are those which take the manipulative
suffix -gat. Besides wergat 'force/persuade' and krokgat 'stir.up ' , the verbs syogat 'order'
and syaugat 'command strongly' may also take embedded complements. Of these verbs
only wer 'seduce/persevere' exists as a separate verb form without the suffix. When wer has
the meaning 'to persevere' or 'to try to work out' it is an intransitive verb. However, when a
verb takes the -gat suffix it becomes transitive. Because the structure of the complement
clauses involved here is identical to those where the matrix clause verb has the -wa suffix, it
is reasonable to posit a similar analysis for these complement clauses. A verb which uses
-gat must have an object and in these cases the complement clause is the object.
10.3.2 EMBFDDFD COMPLEMENT CLAUSE AS OBJECr
Having shown that these complement clauses are subordinate, even though they possess
no overt grammatical marking to indicate this status, the second claim is that these embedded
clauses function as the object of the complement-taking predicate. In one sense this might
seem obvious since a complement clause is by definition a notional object of some predicate;
in the structures under discussion here it is hard to see how it might function as anything
else. Nevertheless there could be differences of opinion over the types of constituent
divisions being made for these sentences. Two examples will be shown again being
representative of the two different predicate types.

"1 83COMPLEMENT CLAUSESrelation. In fact there is no marking anywhere in the structure to show what is the object or
where various constituent divisions can be made. The evidence previously given attempts to
establish that these clauses function as a single unit. If this is not the case then what follows
these verbs must be two divisions: one for the noun phrase which will function as the object
and a second division for what is left, a truncated subjectless clause. This is the type of
division that is made in Relational Grammar, where only part of the embedded clause
assumes the function of direct object and the rest takes the relation of chOmeur 'unemployed'
(Blake: I 990:93ff.). It is a 'raising analysis' where a constituent that belongs logically to the
complement clause is said to be raised to the object of the matrix clause.
This is a possible analysis since Abun clauses are unmarked to show any type of
constituent marking. However, on structural grounds, this analysis is not preferred.
Firstly, with both predicate types involved, the entire clause which functions as the object
can be replaced by a single noun phrase which can operate as the object. For example:
1 0.67An kidoankra3so say COM 3soanbari-wasujimarry with I sosare-wojilike. this-but I soreonot.want-TRS 3so PERF
She said that she would marry me but I did not want her.
1 0.68Kapreanbari-waRahel biaiwergatan.although 3so not.want-TRS Rahel poss father persuade 3so
Although she did not want (to come) Rahel's father persuaded her.
It could be said that if only a single noun phrase can constitute the direct object, as in the
above examples, this would confirm the analysis that only a part of the embedded clause
functions as the direct object. However these sentences show that for Abun sentence
structure only a single constituent division follows the predicate. This single division consists
of the direct object. There is a single division only, rather than two constituent divisions
following the predicate as is posited by the alternative analysis. If it is assumed that there are
two constituents which follow the predicate in these cases--one a direct object and the other a
truncated clause-we are left with determining the constituent status of these truncated
clauses. In some languages like English, it is possible to have reduced subordinate clauses
which have no overt subject as in the following: ' Having eaten the hamburger, he got on with
the rest of his work' . However Abun does not appear to have subjectless subordinate
clauses. If example 1 0.66 is considered again,men mu ki.

"1 79
Does10.3. 1 . 1 ABUN VERB MORPHOLOGY
Applying traditional labels such as infinitive or participial to Abun is difficult. Since Abun
lacks subject-verb agreement and various other means by which the verb may be marked,
the structural definitions that are applied to complement types of other languages (synthetic
rather than isolating languages) cannot be applied to Abun. In Abun the morphological shape
of the verb never changes. It is invariant. There are no verb participles in Abun so it is not
possible to have a participial complement. Neither is there an infinitive in Abun.
Determining what an infinitive is for Abun is somewhat difficult in that such definitions
are usually based on variations of the basic verb, showing person-number marking of the
subject. As has already been stated the Abun verb is invariant since changes to aspect and
mood are carried by particles and subject-verb agreement is not marked in Abun. If an
infinitive is said to be a verb that is 'not able to take a subject NP' , this definition is also
problematic because verbs in Abun normally take a subject P. In Abun, verbs are never said
in isolation. For example, if an enquiry is made as to the Abun terms for such words as
'come' and 'go' the reply is always given using a personal pronoun, usually second person
singular. Therefore 'come' would be given as nan rna 'you come' and 'go' would be given
as na rnu 'you go' . An infinitive cannot be elicited because such a verbal form does not exist.
On some occasions the overt subject of a clause may be omitted, but this is an option the
speaker has and is not obligatory. Predicates which take the -wa suffix may allow the subject
of the complement clause to be elided if it is co-referential with the subject of the main
clause. For example:10.56Ji i-wa
da
ron
a-reo
l sG happY-TRs drink medicine Foc-this
I am happy to (or agree to) take some medicine now.",[191]
"A few nouns have also combined with -gat to fonn verbs, such as: syim-gat 'hand-tNT: to
start' and syo-gat ' mouth-INT: to order' .
3 .30Pilot syim-gat kaparok uk
pilot hand-tNT
airplane sound
The pilot started up the plane again.",[43]
"3.4 CWSED WORD CLASSES
In Abun, there are six basic closed word classes conslstmg of noun adjuncts, verb
adjuncts, conj unctions, proforms, particles and interjections. Each of these and their
subclasses will be discussed in tum below.
With regard to closed classes, Schachter ( 1 985:23) makes the comment that there is a
correlation between the prominence of closed classes in a language and the position of the
language on the analytic-synthetic scale. The more analytic the language is, the more
prominent i s the role of closed classes. Schachter ( 1 985:24) adds, "" . . . much of the semantic
and syntactic work done by the members of closed word classes in analytic languages is
done instead by affixes in synthetic languages."" Therefore, Abun, being heavily analytic, has
many distinct types of closed classes and very few affixes.",[50]

intensification (see §5 .5), but they have borrowed this, even though the actual use of the

NEG1 .6 ABUN AND OTHER WEST PAPUAN PHYLUM LANGUAGES
The closest language lexically to the Abun language is Mai Brat (and in particular, the
Karon Dori dialect), which is also part of the Central B ird' s Head Stock, but is in a different
family, the Central B ird' s Head Family. Even then the lexical relationship is rather low:
somewhere in the order of 1 0-15% are cognate depending upon the dialects compared. Berry
and Berry ( 1 987:30) show figures of 6-8% cognate for a dialect of Mai Brat and each of the
three main Abun dialects. This is based on a word list of 200 words. However, when the
Swadesh 1 00 list is used the percentages tend to be about 5% higher as illustrated in Berry
and Berry ( 1 987:56).
The other West Papuan Phylum languages show a lexical similarity of 3-6% (Berry &
Berry 1987: 30), or about 8- 1 1 % based on the 1 00-word Swadesh list. According to the
critical percentages used for classification of languages based on lexicostatistical comparison
in Voorhoeve ( 1 975a: 1 6), these other languages would be considered as part of a different
stock to Abun. A figure of 1 2-27% of shared cognates would result in the classification of
the languages as belonging to the same stock, but different families. So Abun and Mai Brat
belong to one stock, but they are in different families, on the basis of lexical similarity. The
other languages in the West Papuan Phylum in the Bird's Head belong to other stocks.",[19]
"In example 9.22 above the restricting clause following gato contains no subject. There is a
gap between the relative conjunction gato and the verb phrase man siri 'do wrong' ,
indicating that the embedded clause contains no overt subject. Therefore the grammatical
relation of the head ye 'person' within the restricting clause is subject. Compare this example
with the relation of the relativised argument in example 9.23:
9.23Ii nut-bot
ye
galo ji
i-wa
I SG thought-about person RFL
I SG happY-TRs
I thought about the person that I liked.ne.
DEYHere there is a gap after the verb iwa 'like', even though the transitive suffix -wa indicates
that this verb is a transitive verb. Therefore in this case the head ye 'person' is interpreted as
having the grammatical relation of object in the relative clause. 1 3
13It is to be noted here that this clause also contains a determiner which will be discussed i n §9.S. 1
below. The determiner i s more common when the head has the grammatical relation o f object.",[164]
"3 .2 EsTABLISHING WORD CLASSES
In this section the parts of speech appropriate for the Abun language will be defined after a
discussion of the basis upon which the distinctions are made.
In establishing the parts-of-speech classification for the Abun language, grammatical
criteria have been employed, namely the word ' s distribution, its range of syntactic functions
and the morphological or syntactical categories for which it is specifiable. These criteria are
listed by Schachter ( 1 985 :3), who states they are not open to the objections of unclear
application that traditional definitions are.
Once the types of word classes are established on the basis of grammatical criteria, they
are given a label that reflects their characteristics. For example, words that express actions,
processes and the like are called verbs. A label for a word class is decided upon after the
word class has been established.",[36]

Abun has three subclasses of proforms
interrogative proforms.includingpronouns,prosentences,andThere is only one set of pronouns in Abun which is used for subject, object and possessor
and is listed in Table 3 . 1 4 below. There is significant dialectal variation, with the three main
dialects being distinguished by their first person singular pronoun. In addition to dual forms
trial and greater are possible. Thus me-ka-gri ' we three' or an-ka-at 'they four' are
frequently used in story telling.","[55, 56]"
"Information-seeking questions have a final falling intonation contour similar to yes/no and
alternative questions. Such type of intonation is not what would be expected according to the
findings by U1tan ( 1 978:230), where he points out that information questions have a
considerably better-than-chance probability of having a rising terminal contour.
The question word fol lows the constituent that is the focus of interrogation. In example
6. 1 8, the subject, that is 'the person who came ' , is the focus of interrogation; whereas in 6. 1 9
the object, that is 'the types of plants' , i s the focus of interrogation. I n 6.20 the location is the
focus of interrogation, and in 6.21 the indirect object is the focus of interrogation.

"4.3.2 'I'RANSlTIVE CLAUSES
Transitive clauses contain verbs such as sap 'cut', git 'eat ' , gwa 'hit' and nai 'get ' . The
basic structure is SUBJEIT + VERB + OBJEIT. Example 4.6 illustrates a transitive clause:4.6Men
gil
I PL
eat
SUBJECr VERB
We ate fish.boge-ku.
fish-flesh
OBJECrThe subject, as for intransitive clauses, is obligatory. The object is also notionally
obligatory, however object ellipsis frequently occurs in discourse. In example 4.7 there are
two transitive clauses, the first containing sugil 'food' as the object. However, in the second
clause the object is elided. It could be phrased an gil sugil or, including the object, and the
statement would stil l be acceptable grammatically. In all cases where the object i s elided it is
recoverable from the context.",[63]

"4.3. 1 IN'rRANSITIVE CLAUSES
The verbs in intransitive clauses may be simple verbs of motion such as kas 'run ' , rnu
'go ' , rna 'come ' , titi 'flee ' , ok 'fly ' , e 'fall over' , ges 'fall down ' , sun 'get up' ; verbs of
body functions such as sernda 'dream' , ro 'urinate' , ku 'cough ' ; or verbs relating to a state
such as sern 'be asleep' , kwop 'be dead ' , nyu 'be afraid' , i 'be sick ' , { 'be happy' det 'be
broken ' , karn 'be hot ' .
The basic structure of an intransitive clause is SUBJECT + VERB. The verbs are i n most cases
uninflected, except for those inflections discussed in §3.3. 1 . The subject is obligatory since
no cross-referencing on the verb indicates who or what the subject was. The closest related
language, Maibrat, does have a subject person prefix on the verb, but Abun does not,51CI�USE STRUCTUREnecessitating the continual use of the subject. So, for example, in example 4.4 Isak is
obligatory.","[62, 63]"
"3.3. 1 . 1 THE GRAMMATICALISATION OFml
One of the suffixes that is an inflection on verbs or derives verbs from nouns is -wa. This
suffix has resulted from the lexical fonn , wa ' BENEFACTIVE' , uncergoing gramrnaticalisation.
Frequently the free-form wa is separated from the verb as in example 3.2. It is common
also for wa to be adjacent to the verb, and in these cases coalescence results in a semantic
shift as well as a change in prosody. This occurs because the object is frequently omitted in
Abun grammar, leaving the verb adjacent to wa. The preposition does not coalesce in all
cases, but particularly when the interpretation of the verb and wa is no longer compositional,
it is clear that wa has become the suffix -wa. According to Anderson ( 1 985:42), the inflected
verb, once formed, is then like all words, subject to shift, specialisation, generalisation and
other changes of meaning. The inflected form is seen in example 3.3 as well as in example3 .4.

"CHAPTER 3MORPHOLOGY AND WORD CLASSESTraditionally major classes of words that are gramma tically distinguished in a language
have been called parts of speech. In this chapter, after a brief discussion of morphological
typology (§3 . 1 ), we will explore the parts-of-speech distinctions that are significant for the
Abun language (§3 .2), the components of each word class and their formation (§§3.3 and
3 .4).
Of particular interest is the analytical or isolating nature of the Abun language which
therefore has very little affixation and has, as a result, a prominent role of closed function
word classes.
In addition, many of the free forms in Abun are undergoing the process of
grammaticalisation to become affixes, since they focus on grammatical function rather than
lexical meaning. These free forms are handled together with the affixes in this description of
Abun morphology.","[34, 35]"
