"Remarks on word orderBeing a morphologically complex language, with obligatory argument agreement on the verb, Kwaza has a fairly simple syntax. Although it still remains to
be investigated thoroughly, word order appears to be quite free, and seems to
depend mainly on pragmatic factors. This will be briefly discussed in the present section.
3.3.1. Introduction
The order of placement of the constituents in Kwaza clauses and phrases is
relatively free. In several footnotes throughout the present description, alternative word orders have been indicated by numbers. In such footnotes, word order in the original sentence is implicitly symbolised as 1, 2, 3, etc., in numerical order from left to right. When an alternative word order of the same example is attested, this is represented by a non-numerical order of these numbers,1003. Parts of speech and constituent ordere.g. in notes such as “order 3-1-2 is also permitted” or “order 2-3-1 is ungrammatical”. Notice the footnote that goes with the following example:
(28) Ǌmã'tİ-da-ki manini-tsu-'mãi
'ko-hͿ-tİ
fish-CL:bone-CL:tooth empty-NOM-NOM
fish-1S-DEC
‘I fished without a hook’83
The footnote indicates that the constituents of example (28) can occur in the
following alternative order:
(29) manini-tsu-'mãi
'ko-hͿ-tİ
Ǌmã'tİ-da-ki
fish-CL:bone-CL:tooth empty-NOM-NOM fish-1S-DEC
‘I fished without a hook’
No goal-oriented research was done on word order in Kwaza. In most cases it
is not known what the exact semantic or pragmatic difference is between the
alternative word orders. In some cases it was observed that the first constituent
of a sentence receives focus. Of alternatives which were declared by my consultant to be ungrammatical, or less felicitous than others, it has not been established to what extent this is the case, and whether this really depends on
word order or on other factors.
3.3.2. Predicate and arguments
In intransitive sentences, subject-verb (SV) order is encountered more often
than verb-subject (VS) order, but upon explicit inquiry both are usually allowed. Note the following sets of examples:
(30) 'xyi-dy-hͿ
'kopu ko-'ro-tse
you-POS-NOM cup without-CL:cup-DEC
‘your cup is empty’
(31) ko-'ro-tse
'xyi-dy-hͿ
'kopu
without-CL:cup-DEC you-POS-NOM cup
‘your cup is empty’
(32) e'tay xyi-dy-'hͿ-re
wife I-POS-NOM-INT
‘is she your wife?’83. The order 2-3-1 is also permitted.(33) xyi-dy-'hͿ-re e'tay
I-POS-NOM-INT wife
‘is she your wife?’3.3. Remarks on word order101In transitive sentences, object-verb (OV) order is encountered more often than
verb-object (VO) order, but upon explicit inquiry both are usually allowed.
Note the next pairs of examples:
(34) kreBa-'na ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki
Gleba-LOC tapir bring-FUT-1S-DEC
‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)
(35) kreBa-'na waja-'nã-da-ki
ã'rǊi
Gleba-LOC bring-FUT-1S-DEC tapir
‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)
(36) tsİ̘
hedy-'ra
salt mix-IMP
‘put salt (on the food/drink)!’(37) hedy-'ra tsİ̘
mix-IMP salt
‘put salt (on the food/drink)!’In transitive sentences with an overt subject and an overt object, the order is
usually SVO or SOV. No difference in meaning has been discovered between
these different orders:
(38) kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki zjwãu
canoe=leg-too kill-DEC João
‘the car killed João’84(39) kanwã=ekai-'e zjwãu o'tsi-ki
canoe=leg-too João kill-DEC
‘the car killed João’About an OSV equivalent of the above examples, my consultant remarked that
this would be nonsense:
(40) *?zjwãu kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki
João
canoe=leg-too kill-DEC
‘João killed the car’
Apparently then, in a construction where subject and object precede the predicate, the first position is likely to be reserved for the subject.85
Other word orders have also been attested. Notice the following SVO example:
(41) ho'Bİto aure-da'mͿ-tse
hita-'wã
Roberto marry-want-DEC Rita-AO
‘Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita’84. Animate object marking was not considered as very grammatical: *zjwãwã.
85. If ‘car’ would be marked as an animate object: kanwã?ekai'?ewã, the OSV order
would be acceptable, according to my teacher, but the meaning of the sentence
would be nonsense.","[137, 138, 139]"

Parts of speech and constituent order
The complexity of Kwaza grammar resides to a large extent in its morphology.
Kwaza morphology is predominatingly suffixing. By contrast, the syntax of
Kwaza is fairly simple. Both SVO and SOV word orders occur frequently, but
alternative orders are often allowed. Possibly, Kwaza word order is determined
by discourse-related factors.
The Kwaza word may consist of roots, derivational morphemes and inflexional morphemes, in that order. Of several categories, e.g. the classifiers and
the object markers, it may be difficult to say whether they are inflexional or
derivational. So far, over 300 suffixes were identified.
Kwaza word classes include nouns, verbs, adverbs and several “particles”.
Although the distinction between nouns and verbs may not be absolute in
Kwaza, it is justifiable to say that verb morphology is more complicated than
noun morphology, especially with regard to inflexion.
The present chapter deals with parts of speech, types of morphemes and
constituent order. It is relatively brief since it really only serves to define the
basic concepts that are required for the understanding of the grammar of
Kwaza, the complexity of which I regard as mainly morphological in nature. In
(3.1.) the parts of speech of Kwaza will be introduced and discussed, (3.2.) represents an inventory of different types of morphemes and their distribution, and
in (3.3.) basic characteristics of Kwaza word order will be discussed and illustrated.

"1023. Parts of speech and constituent orderThe constituents of this example can occur in the following alternative OVS
order, apparently without change of meaning:
(42) hita-'wã aure-da'mͿ-tse
ho'Bİto
Rita-AO marry-want-DEC Roberto
‘Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita’
The order in (42) was considered as the “clearest” alternative, so this does indicate that word order is not totally free. However, it does not necessarily mean
that SVO order is in general better than OVS. Notice the following example:
(43) kuraku'ra 'tsje-ki
jere'xwa
chicken
close-DEC jaguar
‘jaguar grabbed chicken’
As mentioned in (4.1.1.6.), there may be a relation between the presumed optionality of the animate case marker and word order. The nature of this relation,
however, has not been established so far. Note that on the application of an
animate case marker, VSO and SOV equivalents of (43) are also allowed:
(44) 'tsje-ki
jere'xwa ku'rakura-'wã
close-DEC jaguar chicken-AO
‘jaguar grabbed chicken’
(45) jere'xwa kuraku'ra-wã 'tsje-ki
close-DEC
jaguar chicken-AO
‘jaguar grabbed chicken’
The range of word order variability may not only depend partially on case
marking, but also on overt cross-reference agreement of subjects and the emphatic use of pronouns. Compare the following examples:
(46) si 'kui-da-ki
hã
(47) hã
'kui-da-ki
water drink-1S-DEC
I drink-1S-DEC water
‘it is me who is drinking/drank water’
‘I am drinking/drank water’
(48) *si hã
'kui-da-ki
I water drink-1S-DEC
‘it is me who is drinking/drank water’
Example (48) was considered ungrammatical, but it is not clear how that
should be interpreted. In ditransitive sentences, the order relative position of
the direct and indirect objects is also variable:3.3. Remarks on word order103(49) mƭu
marju-'wã 'hai-da-ki
chicha Mario-AO drench-1S-DEC
‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
(50) mƭu
'hai-da-ki
marju-'wã
chicha drench-1S-DEC Mario-AO
‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
The following order is also permitted, although it is considered as less wellformed:
(51) marju-'wã mƭu
'hai-da-ki
Mario-AO chicha drench-1S-DEC
‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
3.3.3. Predicate and satellites
The relative order of predicate and local satellites seems to be free. Compare
the next example to (34) :
(52) ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki
kreBa-'na
tapir bring-FUT-1S-DEC Gleba-LOC
‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)
Notice also the following set of alternatives:
(53) ͅrjãwã-'na o'nİ-ki
(54) o'nİ-ki
ͅrjãwã-'na
return-DEC forest-LOC
forest-LOC return-DEC
‘he came/went out of the forest’
‘he came/went out of the forest’
3.3.4. Predicate and adverbs
The relative order of predicate and adverbs is variable. The adverb occurs often
at the beginning or at the end of a clause:
(55) la'to
tsu'ty kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki
yesterday head hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC
‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’
(56) la'to
kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki
yesterday hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC
‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’tsu'ty
head1043. Parts of speech and constituent order(57) kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki
tsu'ty la'to
hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC head yesterday
‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’
The adverb does not necessarily occur at the periphery of the clause:
(58) a-ri'tsa
a'wͿi-da-ki coha-si'ki
Ø-DR:outside see-1S-DEC foot-CL:skin
‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))

3.3.5. Noun and modifier
The usual constituent order of modification constructions is head-dependent:
(60) txa'hͿ tsi'cwa-rjͿ
'Ǌi-da-ki
path
begin-CD:area lie-1S-DEC
‘I rested at the beginning of the road’
However, an alternative order is also attested. Compare these examples:
(61) 'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-'hͿ
board
house-CAU-1P-NOM
‘boards to build a house’(62) a'xy-dy-a-'hͿ
'tauBa
house-CAU-1P-NOM board
‘boards to build a house’The following set of examples shows how the relative order between a noun
and a demonstrative modifier order may vary, and even how a matrix predicate
may be inserted between an argument and the demonstrative:
(63) ko'sa Ϳ-'hͿ
si-dy-'hͿ-ki
(64) Ϳ-'hͿ
ko'sa si-dy-'hͿ-ki
this-NOM sun I-POS-NOM-DEC
sun this-NOM I-POS-NOM-DEC
‘the / this lantern is mine’
‘the / this lantern is mine’
(65) ko'sa 'si-dy-hͿ-ki
Ϳ-'hͿ
sun I-POS-NOM-DEC this-NOM
‘the / this lantern is mine’
However, it may be possible that the demonstrative in (65) stands in extraposition.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"
"Structural characteristics of KwazaThe Kwaza vowel system comprises eight oral vowel phonemes and seven nasal vowel phonemes. The central close-mid vowel /y/ also occurs in semivowel
position. Nasality may spread to neighbouring vowels. There are 19 consonant
phonemes, among which implosive and apico-alveolar stops. Basic syllable
structure is Consonant-Vowel, and glides may occupy consonant position, either together with other consonants or not. There is no phonemic tone, stress or
quantity. Main word stress tends to fall on the ultimate syllable of the stem. A
provisional analysis of the phonology of Kwaza was published by van der
Voort (1997a).
The grammatical categories of Kwaza are verbs, nouns, adverbs, particles,
ideophones and auxiliary-like roots. There are no adjectives. Constituent order
in Kwaza is relatively free, although Subject-Verb-Object and Subject-ObjectVerb patterns prevail. Morphologically, Kwaza is a highly complex language
and most of the grammatical load is to be found on the verbs. There are over
300 derivational and inflexional suffixes and the distinction between these
categories is gradual rather than absolute. There are no complex morphophonological processes. Reduplication and compounding occur frequently.",[61]
"241. IntroductionNominal morphology is fairly simple. Nouns, including pronouns, demonstratives and numerals, are not inflected for number or gender. Only a third
person possessor may be morphologically marked. Nouns may receive animate
object case marking or one of the oblique case markers: instrumental, locative,
beneficiary and comitative. Nouns can be zero-verbalised by attachment of person and mood marking. Nouns can be modified by other nouns which are
placed in juxtaposition. Because complex verb forms can be nominalised and
function as nouns, nouns can of course be morphologically complex.
Verbs are obligatorily marked for subject and mood, whereas overt pronominal or lexical arguments are optional. Both the subject agreement system
and the personal pronoun system contain a distinction between first person inclusive and first person exclusive. Since the system explicitly indicates exclusive agreement, by the form -xa-, the notions “singular” and “plural” are used
for convenience sake, even though the system is analysed as being based on
distinctions of “association”. Third person agreement is zero-marked. Indefinite
argument agreement has no lexical counterpart. Mood inflexion comprises declarative, interrogative, the three persuasive moods imperative, exhortative and
volitive, which complement one another, and three prohibitive moods negative
imperative, negative exhortative and monitory. In the imperative and negative
imperative, second person “singular” subject agreement is zero-marked. Object
agreement of the verb is optional and can perhaps be regarded as derivational.
Negation, valency and valency change, and tense, modality and aspect are also
marked by a wide array of (probably derivational) verbal morphemes. Some
morphemes of modality are etymologically related to mood markers, such as
the causational morpheme -nƭ- and the exhortative mood marker -ni. Verbs can
be turned into nouns or adverbs by the highly multifunctional stem-final nominalising morphemes -hͿ and -nãi.
Two quite prominent morphological categories in Kwaza are those of class
and directionality. Classifying morphemes have a very wide distribution and
may have nominalising and agreement properties. They can have a very general
meaning and refer to shape, substance and texture, but the majority are semantically rather specific. In the present analysis, there are close to 150 classifiers.
Directional morphemes have a more limited distribution. They either occur on
verbs, where they indicate the direction in which an action or event takes place,
or they are used to form directional adverbs. There are nearly 45 directionals.
The distributions of classifiers and directionals overlap partially, and a small
number of these morphemes are ambiguous in this respect.
The moods mentioned earlier are restricted to matrix clauses. In Kwaza several different types of subordinate clauses may be formed. Subordinate clauses
usually precede matrix clauses. The predicates of subordinate clauses contain
the same subject agreement forms as mentioned earlier, but they have different
“mood” markers. Among the adverbial clauses there are two types of conditional clauses, two basic types of concessive clauses, and additive, manner,
temporal and contemporative clauses, all marked by different predicate-final
morphemes. Among the nominal clauses there are attributive (relative) clauses1.9. Structural characteristics of Kwaza25and complement clauses. These involve the same nominalisers as referred to
above. Kwaza does neither have infinitives nor conjunctional particles. However, long chains of medial clauses can be constructed through the cosubordinative “mood” marker. In these constructions a distinction is made between
same subject and different subject. The different subject marker is always
found on the subordinate clause, whereas it indicates that the subject of the next
clause is going to be different. When one of the different subjects is a non-third
person, a special switch reference mood marker is required.
A special phenomenon in Kwaza, rare among the Amerindian languages, is
morphological ellipsis. Although verbs are canonically obligatorily marked for
person and mood, these inflexions can be omitted if the context permits. Inversely, the inflexional complex of person and mood marking can occur freely
without a verb stem under similar circumstances. In both situations the hearer
can be expected to deduce from the context which verb stem or which inflexions were intended by the speaker. On a more grammatical level, independently
occurring person and mood inflexions can also function as resumptive particles, and double layers of person and mood inflexion are instrumental in morphologically complex constructions which have “complementising” functions
such as desiderative and quotation. A discussion of these phenomena from the
perspective of grammaticalisation was also the subject of a separate article (van
der Voort 2002a). Other unique grammatical phenomena in Kwaza concern
morphologically motivated reduplication of bound person markers to express
tense distinctions, and alternative morpheme orders to formally express the
distinction between canonical negation and negation of a presupposition.
In the lexicon of Kwaza many items are encountered which show morphological structure. Often, formally similar roots without such morphological
complexity are semantically related, but not in an entirely productive way.
Therefore, such apparent morphological complexity is considered as lexicalised
and such roots are treated as monomorphemic. Nevertheless, there are certain
roots which are (semi-)lexicalised with morphemes that retain some productive
properties, such as those of the verb stem haka-(hͿ)- ‘to be old’. In the present
work I refer to these latter roots as bound or etymological roots.
The following text excerpt is to illustrate some of the phenomena mentioned
in the present section:

A short grammatical sketch of the language was presented in van der Voort
(2000b). Aikhenvald and Dixon (1999:363-364) contains a brief typological
characterisation of the language.
1.10. The classification of Kwaza
If mentioned at all, Kwaza is usually classified as “isolated” (e.g. Loukotka
1963, 1968 and Rodrigues 1986). In two recent sources, Kwaza is even registered as an extinct (Kaufman 1990:49) or possibly extinct (Campbell 1997:198)
isolated language. For the lack of sufficient comparative data, solid proof for
the classification as isolated has been absent so far. Therefore, Kwaza is in reality an unclassified language.
In some sources, the language is affiliated with other languages. In Loukotka (1950:128), Kwaza is under the name “language of the São Pedro creek”
grouped together with Kapixana (i.e. Kanoê) as a Kapixana language, probably
because of the apparent cognate lexeme aki ‘stone’ (1950:141). In the same article, however, the language is considered as an unclassified language, under
the name Quaia (1950:137). In 1957, Loukotka identified the São Pedro language on the basis of Zack’s manuscript (1943) as Kwaza and classifies it under the names “Koaiá or Quaiá” as isolated (Loukotka 1963:12).
Greenberg (1987) classified Kwaza on the basis of a few lexemes as belonging to the Macro-Tucanoan linguistic stock: e'cǊi ‘eye’, mani'ni ‘fish’,
ha'ki ‘stone’, hi ‘fire’, co'ha ‘foot’, cuku ‘tongue’ and e'tay ‘woman’. The word
ha'ki is probably correctly related to Kanoê (Capixana) and Aikanã (Huari), but
the other words, which he compares to forms in Puinave, seem far-fetched. If
these words should point to a relation with Macro-Tucanoan, then a score of
other words can be added to the list with an equal degree of plausibility, such
as hoi ‘bat’, mã'bi ‘arrow’, jã'si- ‘hear’, tai ‘lizard’, e'kãi ‘mouth’ and others
(compare also the Proto-Tucanoan forms as reconstructed by Waltz and
Wheeler 1972). In fact, several of these words, and many others, can be related
to Aikanã and Kanoê as well (the inclusion of which in Macro-Tucanoan or
any other stock is as questionable as of Kwaza). Note furthermore that a number of words could be just as well related to languages from other stocks proposed by Greenberg. The correspondences are fascinating but the long dis1.11. Organisation of the present work27tances combined with the sparse evidence make Greenberg’s claims premature.
In van der Voort (fcb), the linguistic correspondences and possible relationships between Kwaza and neighbouring languages are discussed.
1.11. Organisation of the present work
This book consists of three parts: a grammar (part I), texts (part II) and a dictionary (part III). It is an attempt to describe the Kwaza language. It neither
follows a specific theoretical model, nor does it examine theoretical implications of the analysis. Its primary concern is to prevent the Kwaza language
from disappearing without leaving behind representative documentation. The
description is intended to be comprehensive and dependable, so that theoretical
issues can be dealt with in later studies.
The basic orientation of this grammar is formal rather than functional, that
is, the structure of the present description is determined by the productive
forms of the language and the way they are used, rather than by possible
grammatical functions and the way these are realised by the grammatical system. Nevertheless, the sections are not always located where they could be expected to be on formal grounds. The subsection about classifiers (4.2.) is relevant both for nominal and verbal morphology. Since classification is important
for a complete understanding of attributive modification, numerals and demonstratives, I have discussed it prior to these. The subsections which concern adverbial affixes (6.2.4.) have been placed together, because I deemed it convenient to have all adverbial morphology in one place rather than scattered
throughout the book. Finally, the chapter on complex constructions (8.) also
has a basis in verbal morphology. However, since that morphology is characteristic for subordinate clauses, its grammatical domain is greater than that of
the verb alone. Therefore, I have discussed it after the sections on nouns, verbs
and adverbs. The subsections of (8.) together provide a complete account of
subordinate clause formation. If a strictly formal arrangement were followed,
the discussion of subordinate constructions would become highly fragmented.
Additionally, some minor subsections have been assigned to chapters on functional grounds, such as (5.1.7.) on the impersonal use of the special verb root
jã- ‘to be’, although they are also mentioned in chapters where they belong
formally (in this case 7.6.2.).
In the present work the subject of morpheme order has not been discussed
thoroughly. Its basic characteristics are dealt with briefly in (3.2.) as a separate
issue. Otherwise, it is only discussed in an ad hoc manner in those places where
it is of immediate importance for identification or proper understanding of a
specific morpheme, such as e.g. the negative morpheme -he- in (7.1.).
With regard to the internal organisation of the subsections, I have striven to
discuss the most common constructions, and the examples which serve to illustrate them, first, and the more exceptional ones towards the end of these
subsections.","[61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"

5.1.1. Remarks on the cross-reference forms and further examples
With respect to table (22) above some remarks are in order. Firstly, most of the
object markers have to be combined with subject markers. Furthermore, some
object cross-reference forms are portmanteau morphemes. Finally, both third
person subjects and third person objects get zero morphological expression. In
the present section the constituent elements of cross-reference marking will be
discussed separately. First the subject forms will be dealt with, and then the
object forms, both in alphabetical order. Indefinite and impersonal argument
cross-reference will be dealt with in the separate sections (5.1.4.) and (5.1.5.)
respectively.
Certain temporal and aspectual constructions are formed, among other
ways, through repetition, or perhaps better, reduplication of cross-reference
morphemes. In the remote past construction the reduplicated person markers
have a slightly different form and are best considered as allomorphs of the canonical person markers. These are discussed and demonstrated extensively in
(5.5.4.), and in the following sections I will only mention their existence and
their appearance.
5.1.1.1. Subject cross-reference
a ‘1P’. The first person plural subject form -a- is the unmarked default form in
the distinction between inclusive and exclusive. In fact, only the exclusive is
marked, through the element -xa- in -a-xa-. An important reason why -a- by
itself could be regarded as inclusive is that the difference with first person -daotherwise would have to be explained in terms of a number distinction. Never5.1. Person cross-reference249theless, -a- will be glossed as ‘1P’ in order to avoid incompatible glossing in
the exclusive situation. The distinction between inclusive and exclusive will be
further elaborated upon in sections (5.1.2.) and (5.1.3.). -a- is obligatorily used
for first person plural subject and can be combined with all possible objects.
The rare allomorph -ay- occurs in the remote past construction (5.5.4.).
da ‘1S’. The first person singular subject form -da- is glossed as ‘1S’ even
though the difference with -a- is probably not a number difference. -da- can be
combined with all possible objects.
(1043)si 'mİ̘-da-ki
zjwãu
I beat-1S-DEC João
‘I hit João’The allomorph -day- occurs in the remote past construction. As shown in
(5.5.4.), it appears usually as a reduplicated form, preceded by the canonical
form -da-, and followed by a nominalising element:
(1044)na-ay-'wyo'nİ-da-day-hͿ-kiPROX-that-time arrive-1S-1S-NOM-DEC‘I arrived at that time’In certain nominal(ised) expressions which do not have a past reading, -daycan occur by itself:
(1045)aky'nͿ-day-hͿ
friend-1S-NOM
‘my friend’(1046)mama'ñͅ-day-'nãi are'ta-da-ki
sing-1S-NOM
know-1S-DEC
‘I know how to sing’It is not perfectly clear why -day- occurs instead of -da- in these constructions.
Maybe there is a habitual connotation.
xa ‘2’. The second person subject form -xa- may refer to singular or plural
subjects, and is hence glossed as ‘2’. It is homophonous with the third person
associated subject form -xa-. In rapid speech the pronunciation of -xa- may
change to [tsa]. Second person subject -xa- does not occur in combination with
first person singular object marking.

(5.5.4.), but note the rare occurrences of non-reduplicated nominal(ised) instances of -xay- without a past sense:2505. The verb phrase(1049)aky'nͿ-xay-nahere

‘I want to learn your language’xa ‘AS’. The third person associated subject form -xa- occurs as the second
element of the exclusive morpheme combination -a-xa- and of the Kwaza
equivalent of the second person plural -xa-xa-:
(1051)aku'tjǊ-nahe're-wa

see-2-AS-DEC
Indian-COLL-AO
‘you are looking at the Indians’The fact that this morpheme is homophonous with the second person subject
morpheme -xa- creates the impression that second person plural is based on reduplication of the second person form: -xa-xa. However, a single -xa- can also
express a plural second person subject, as in (1055). Furthermore the element
-xa- is not reduplicated in the definite non-third person object forms. Also, it
not present in all transitive second person subject forms. Finally it is not always
present in intransitive second person subject forms in all moods, such as the
imperative (see 5.2.1.3.). In transitive inflexion, the associated form only appears with second person plural objects and indefinite objects (see table 23 below).
5.1.1.2. Object cross-reference
eteja ‘1PO’. The first person “plural” object form -eteja- occurs in combination
with all subject markers, including indefinite subject. Although this form is not
further analysable, the element -ete- also occurs in the second person “plural”
object form -etelexwa-, and in both forms it may also be pronounced as [İte]
and [Ite]. The element -ja- resembles the indefinite object form -ja- but it is
probably lexicalised (see 5.1.4.).

"4.3. Attributive modification181In relation to the second type of modification, it should also be mentioned
that there are demonstrative, numeral and attributive roots which are neither
clearly verbal nor nominal and which always require the application of a nominalising morpheme, either -hͿ, another classifier, or another nominaliser, in order to form a complete stem/word and occur as such in an attributive construction. In a number of cases, a special attributive morpheme -Ϳ- is required. It
should furthermore be added that nominalised verbs represent verb-noun derivations which may range in complexity between a morphosyntactically very
simple predicate with a semantically attributive root, to a fully-fledged relative
clause-like finite verb phrase with case marked arguments and all.
The basic principle is always the same: attributive modification of a noun is
realised by juxtaposition of another noun. Under the proper circumstances the
modified head noun in a noun phrase may be omitted, leaving the dependent
modifying noun to represent the referring noun phrase. In this section the various ways in which modifiers are formed and applied to head nouns are discussed. Many additional examples of noun modification can be encountered in
section (4.2.) on classifiers. Kwaza attributive constructions are also the subject
matter of a separate article (van der Voort fca).
4.3.1. Possessive
One important form of nominal modification is possessive modification.
Kwaza has no possessive pronouns. The possessor- the modifier in the Kwaza
possessive construction- is a personal pronoun or a noun. These constructions
require a derivational possessive morpheme -dy-, which must be applied to the
possessor and which must be followed by a classifier, usually the nominaliser
-hͿ, which functions as a semantically neutral classifier. Some examples are:
(657) 'si-dy-hͿ ecǊi'ri
I-POS-NOM buttock
‘my buttock’(658) 'si-dy-hͿ
'kopu ko-'ro-tse
I-POS-NOM cup without-CL:cup-DEC

112.The order 231 is also possible.","[218, 219]"
"1204. The noun phrase(198) atxitxi'?Ǌ du'dunjǊ-a-hͿ
rice
pound-1P-NOM
‘pounded rice’
The possibility of object marking in (197) is not understood, but its impossibility in (198) can probably be explained in relation to the fact that this phrase
represents an attributive construction. The object of the verb root is the head of
this attributive construction (see also 4.3.2. and 8.4.1.).
4.1.1.9. Concluding remarks
In conclusion, we can say that objects of transitive verbs tend to be case
marked in the first place because they belong to the animate category. When
they are inanimate, case marking is ungrammatical. From a formal point of
view, case marking is not strictly necessary in order to distinguish between the
subject and the object, because the subject is identified by cross-reference
marking on the verb. However, if all arguments are third persons there is room
for ambiguity. In the absence of case marking, if both subject and object are
animate third persons, there would be no way to know on the basis of the syntax alone which would be what. From a pragmatic point of view, the absence of
case marking generally does not create ambiguity when the verbal object is inanimate. The same holds for indirect objects of semantically ditransitive verbs:
it is usually people who give things to living beings. So, if the case marker -wã
were an animacy marker alone, the disambiguation function would be an automatic side effect. Nevertheless, it is essential when the arguments of transitive
verbs are equal in animacy and person. Therefore -wã is bifunctional: it serves
to mark both animacy and objecthood. At the same time, it reflects the much
attested pragmatically based tendency to prefer to give subject function to animate beings (see e.g. Comrie 1989:128). From the contrast between certain
verbs, remember the pair (106) and (107), it appears also that in the grammar of
Kwaza, human beings are higher on the animacy hierarchy than non-human
animate beings.
The occurrence of -wã on inanimate nouns, as in (197), is not understood in
the light of the present analysis.
For some verbs no information was obtained regarding the question whether
animate object marking is optional, obligatory or ungrammatical:

In combination with the element -a- and the nominaliser -hͿ, -wã may have
an adverbialising function. This is discussed in (6.2.4.3.).
4.1.2. Locative -na
The locative case ending -na, also pronounced often as [nã], basically expresses the sense of ‘in’. It is also used as a general marker expressing other locational senses as ‘into, under, from, etc.’, often in combination with verbs
bearing a directional suffix (see 5.3.).

pan-LOC-ATT-NOM begin-CSO water shed-DEC

As will be seen in (4.1.3.), the locative can also be expressed by the instrumental ending -ko.
In some instances a locative or instrumental object is already understood
from the pragmatic context or from the semantic content of the verb, in which
case it is not considered acceptable to add one:
(217) (*? xui-'na / xui-'ko) atxitxi
bag-LOC / bag-INS maize
‘I put the maize (in the bag)’boi-'dy-da-ki
fill-CAU-1S-DECIn the above example the bag is a “local” object, and not a subject or (in)direct
object. One may inquire about the local object:
(218) tsǊhǊ-rati-'na
what-FOC-LOC
‘in what?’
Only nouns which function as locative adverbs may occur without locative or
instrumental case marking. Such nouns often bear the classifier/directional -rjͿ
‘area’ (see 4.2. and 6.2.3.).
4.1.3. Instrumental -ko
The ending -ko marks the noun as an instrumental argument of the verb.
(219) prego-'ko'twe-ki
lo'te
(220) co'ha-ko 'dai?oce-'ra
foot-INS clear-IMP
spike-INS pierce-DEC door

‘kick it aside with your foot!’
(221) ho'ho-Ϳ-mǊ-'ko
ha'je-wa-ki
black-ATT-CL:liquid-INS smear-IS-DEC
‘it is painted black’
Instrumental -ko can also be omitted. One would expect that arguments
without instrumental or locative case marking are nuclear arguments instead of4.1. Case123local arguments. With some verbs the omission of -ko may indicate an alternative valency interpretation:
(222) mƭu-(ko)
nǊ'ri-da-ki
chicha-INS satiate-1S-DEC
‘I’m full of chicha’
Because verbs are often not morphologically marked for transitivity, it is not
certain that (222) is transitive when -ko is omitted. With respect to the arguments in the following examples my teacher explained that “they are more correct with -ko, but if you are lazy or you don’t feel like talking, you leave it
out”:
(223) awe-mǊ-(ko)
haha-nͿ-'djo-xa-re
rain-CL:liquid-INS wash-REF-CL:foot-2-INT
‘are you washing your foot with rainwater?’
(224) awe-mǊ-(ko)
haha-'djo-hata-ni
rain-CL:liquid-INS wash-CL:foot-3S.2O-EXH
‘let the rainwater wash your foot!’
The consultant’s remark probably indicates that the omission of the case
marker does not reflect increase of the verb’s valency. Note the following ungrammatical example:
(225) *awe-mǊ
haha-ki
xyi-dy-hͿ
coha
rain-CL:liquid wash-DEC you-POS-NOM foot
‘the rainwater washes your foot’
The consultant explained that this sentence was incorrect because “the rain did
not place me here, in order to wash me”95. This remark indicates that the rain is
not considered a proper agentive argument of the verb.
Although grammatical omission of instrumental -ko does not necessarily
imply that the noun is a nuclear argument of the verb, it is not entirely optional
either. Omission of -ko does have an influence of the meaning of the sentence:
(226) awe-mǊ-'ko
toma-'ra
rain-CL:liquid-INS bathe-IMP
‘take a bath with rainwater (from the barrel)!’
(227) awe-'mǊ
toma-'ra
rain-CL:liquid bathe-IMP
‘take a bath (standing) in the rain!’

"923. Parts of speech and constituent orderThere is no justification for adjectives, articles and adpositions as separate
categories.
3.1.1. Nouns
Nouns form an open class that is characterised by a number of properties, some
of which contrast with those of other grammatical categories, such as verbs.
Pronouns and proper names are regarded as closed subclasses of nouns. Nouns
have the following properties:
a)
b)
c)
d)Nominal roots can occur as free morphemes, and this is the most important formal property that distinguishes them from verbal roots.
Nouns can function as arguments of a predicate or as attributive modifiers of other nouns.
Nouns can be inflected for case, whereas they are not inflected for gender, definiteness and number.
Nouns can be the result of nominalisation of verbs. Since the grammar of
Kwaza is characterised by great verbal morphological complexity, this
means that nouns can be internally quite complex. Note the object in the
following example sentence:(16) Ǌcenãi-'he-da-hͿ
ere'we-da-ki
know-NEG-1S-NOM write-1S-DEC
‘I’m writing what I don’t know’
e)Nouns can consist of the semantically empty root e- and a bound classifying morpheme, which is an important formal property that distinguishes them from adverbs. Note the following example:(17) e-'mǊ
Ø-CL:liquid
‘liquid’
Note that predicative use of nouns in Kwaza is realised through zeroverbalisation, by direct attachment of verbal morphology. In order determine
whether the root of a certain predicate is a noun, one needs to know whether it
also has properties a), b) and c). Zero-verbalisation is discussed in (4.4.9.).
3.1.2. Verbs
Verbs form an open class and share a number of properties which members of
the other categories do not have:3.1. Parts of speecha)
b)
c)93Verbs consist of roots which cannot occur as free elements. This forms a
basic difference with nouns, adverbs and particles.
Verbs require person and mood inflexion.
Verbs can be nominalised by attachment of nominalising suffixes or
classifiers. Note the following example, ending in a classifier:(18) 'ha-Ϳ-xy
clean-ATT-CL:leaf
‘white paper’
d)Since arguments do not have to be expressed by independent nouns or
pronouns, and are always referred to by person inflexions, a verb can be
the sole constituent of a complete sentence.","[129, 130, 131]"
"3.2. Types of morphemes97Note that in Kwaza, reduplication is not only defined by phonotactic
boundaries, i.e. it does not exclusively concern reduplication of roots or syllables. Also certain bound morphemes such as person markers can be reduplicated, as a special grammatical means to express aspectual and temporal differences. This is discussed in section (7.3.).
The different types of morphemes in Kwaza are listed in the table below:

Within the word, the facultative derivational morphemes occur basically between the root on the left and the inflexions on the right. The example below
shows the canonical relative position of morphemes inside the noun and the
verb:
(27) atxitxi'mu
kui'nãxare
atxitxi-mu
kui-nã-xa-re

maize-CL:liquid
Noun-Classifier
Verb-Tense-Person-Mood
ROOT-DERIVATION
ROOT-DERIVATION-INFLEXION-INFLEXION
‘do you want to drink maize chicha?’ (HYPOTETICAL EXAMPLE)
Although much more research still has to be done with regard to morpheme positions, it is possible to make a few general statements.
In nouns, the first morpheme is usually the obligatory noun root. Thereafter
derivational morphemes may follow, such as possessive and attributive. In the
subsequent positions classifiers or a nominaliser or other derivational morphemes may occur. If relevant, the noun may be terminated by an object argument case or oblique case inflexion. The obligatory slots are in bold print:

Thereafter optional derivational morphemes follow, such as directional, classifier, attributive, tense, modality, aspect, valency change, object person and
negative morphemes, more or less in that order. Thereafter come the obligatory
subject person and the word-final mood inflexions. In certain constructions,
derivational elements such as the negative morpheme and a tense, modality or
aspect morpheme occur between the person and mood inflexions.

for morpheme slots in specific constructions such as compounds, reduplication,
quotation and certain others.

1. Introduction
The third part of this description of Kwaza concerns the material which
comprises the lexicon. This part contains 2200 unique free and bound
morphemes of the language, all that I have encountered so far. In section (2.)
below, all recorded Kwaza morphemes are listed as headwords in the
phonological orthography and according to the alphabetical order as proposed for
Kwaza. This alphabetical order, which was also presented in the phonological
chapter in part I, section (2.17), is as follows:
a ã b/B d/D e Ӂ İ İҊ f g h i ƭ j y ӻ k l m n ñ ng o õ œ p r s x t ts c tx u Ǌ ü v w z zj ?
Headwords are only listed in their radical forms, with the following
consequences. Nouns and adverbs are presented as complete words. Verbs are
presented as uninflected underived roots, which end in a hyphen. Transparently
derived forms do not have separate entries but may be dealt with under the entry
of their root. There are also verb roots which require further derivation with
specific affixes from a very limited set. Since these root and affix combinations
are not completely lexicalised I have presented the bound or etymological roots
in separate entries, but without such affixes. Conversely, certain verb roots that
contain recognisable but truly fossilised or lexicalised morphological elements
are presented in separate entries. Affixes are presented as isolated elements in
separate entries. Apart from the two prefixes, all affixes start with a hyphen and,
in case they cannot occur word-finally, they also end with a hyphen.
The first line of each entry starts with a Kwaza headword, or rather,
headform, followed by an abbreviation between brackets, which indicates the
grammatical category of the headform, and it ends in an English equivalent of the
headform. In the rest of the entry, more specific grammatical information is
given, and illustrated by Kwaza examples of use in italic print, followed by free
English translations in inverted commas. The examples of use are not always in a
strictly phonological spelling, and contain additional phonetic information, such
as multiple stress marking, length, deviating vowel and consonant qualities and
other idiosyncrasies.
On certain occasions, forms are presented in phonetic spelling in square
brackets. Note that this does not involve the IPA alphabet as in the other parts of
the present description, but that it is based on the phonemic orthography.
Futhermore, italics are also used in this case. This means that e.g. /c/ is
symbolised as [t] in part I and II, and as [c] here in part III. The [B] and [D] in
part III represent the plosive [b] and [d], and [O] represents close-mid [o]. In a816Dictionarynumber of instances the family or the exact speaker who uttered a certain
example is specified by an abbreviation.
Whenever forms from neighbouring languages to which I happened to have
access showed similarities to the Kwaza forms, these were usually added at the
end of the entry in italic print. In respect to Kwaza terminology for flora and
fauna species, I have tried to find the corresponding Western scientific
equivalents mainly via the Brazilian Portuguese translations obtained from
consultants, thus in an indirect manner. Unfortunately, identical popular names
are very often used for different species in different regions, and dictionaries and
handbooks are therefore often contradictory. It even seems possible that some
species may not have received a Western scientific name yet. Therefore there are
doubts about a number of Western equivalents of local names in the present
dictionary. In a number of cases I did not succeed to identify a Kwaza name with
a certain species at all. In case of doubt I added the Aikanã terms, if available,
even if they were not likely to be etymologically related to the Kwaza terms. The
usual order is: scientific terms (species, genus, family, order); Portuguese terms;
English terms, all whenever available.
Portuguese loanwords are also included if they are not the result of codeswitching, but have clearly become naturalised, i.e. part of the Kwaza lexicon,
e.g. through phonological adaptation. Their Portuguese origin is always
indicated. In contrast to the Portuguese equivalents of scientific terms mentioned
above, Portuguese forms that can explain Kwaza forms are always in italics.
Section (3.) below contains an English-Kwaza index to the preceding
vocabulary. Because of the broad meaning of certain headforms, a number of
Kwaza forms are repeated with alternative English translations. This is why the
index has a higher number of entries (nearly 2800) than the vocabulary. Within
certain translational domains, such as “stick” or “foot”, the different Kwaza
equivalents are alphabetised according to the order in the Kwaza alphabet, where
e.g. <y> occurs before <k> and <c> after <ts>.
All abbreviations used in this dictionary are listed at the beginning of this
work. All bibliographical references encountered in the dictionary are included in
the list of references.","[851, 852, 853, 854]"
"3005. The verb phrasetranslated as ‘think that, it seems that, maybe’. Maybe it consists of the morphemes -te-he-re ‘(-INTENS-NEG-INT)’:
(1351)awe-'nã-tehere
rain-FUT-APPR
‘I think it is going to rain’Finally, there is a focus suffix -rati- (see 7.2.8.) which is often combined with a
question word in an interrogative matrix sentence:
(1352)tsuhǊ-ra'ti-wã hã
'ta-a-re
what-FOC-AO water say-1P-INT
‘what does “hã” mean?’(1353)wai-ra'ti-re
good-FOC-INT
‘is it delicious?’The specific morphemes involved in the emphatic interrogative expressions
will be treated more extensively in the aforementioned sections.
5.2.2.2. Gerundial -tsy- in the interrogative
As we have seen in third person examples like (1331) the interrogative marker
is attached to the zero-marked verb root. Although there is no alternation in the
interrogative between forms comparable to declarative -ki and -tse, there is a
morpheme which resembles -tse. The element -tsy- may be inserted between
subject cross-reference marking (which is zero for the third person) and interrogative -re. No solid explanations have been found with regard to its presence
or absence. Alternatively, the element -tsy- often occurs in nominalised constructions that can be identified as gerundial and which end in -tsy-hͿ (see
8.1.2.). There is a morpheme that is homophonous with -tsy-, but which has
been identified as an potential tense/aspect marker. Although I see no compelling reason to relate it to declarative -tse and gerundial -tsy-, it does have a
somewhat similar distribution, which may lead to ambiguity in the interrogative. Compare the following examples to (1331):
(1354)di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re
who cut-GER-INT
‘who cut (the tree)?’di'lİ 'cu-tsy-re
who cut-POT-INT
‘who is going to cut (the tree)?’The example in which -tsy- is analysed as gerundial has a past tense reading
when contrasted to present tense (1331) and to the potential construction that
has a future tense interpretation. It is unclear whether -tsy- is an allomorph of
declarative -tse in the third person interrogative or whether it is a different
morpheme. Probably the function of gerundial -tsy- is to give an extra cleft-like
effect, like ‘who could it be who ...?’ or ‘what could it be that ...?’. Note that in
case of verb stem ellipsis, -tsy- always precedes -re. In fact, tsyre is often used5.2. Mood301as a free minimal response particle, with a potential connotation of doubt: ‘is
it?’, ‘would it be?’, ‘I don’t know’. The element -tsy- is dealt with extensively
in section (8.1.). Gerundial -tsy- in combination with the interrogative is discussed further in (8.1.2.1.).
5.2.3. Imperative
The imperative mood marker -ra is used to indicate the speech act of commanding by which the hearer can be required, requested or invited to do something. The imperative marker attracts stress.
(1355)wady-'ra
give-IMP
‘give (it to him)!’(1357)e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-'ra
woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
‘give (it) to all women!’(1358)Q:İ-'nã-da-ki

‘I’m going’(1356)A:wa'dy-e'teja-'ra
give-1PO-IMP
‘give (it) to us!’İ-'ra
go-IMP
‘go!’182Two possible subjects have been attested for imperative verbs: second person
singular, which is zero-marked, and second person plural, which is marked by
-xa-. Zero-marking is explicitly indicated only in the first two of the examples
below:
(1359)ka'we
kui-Ø-'ra
coffee drink-2-IMP
‘drink coffee!’ (2sg)(1360)ka'we
'kui-Ø-xa-'ra
coffee drink-2-AS-IMP
‘drink coffee!’ (2pl)(1361)xyi'tsİ tͅi'tja

‘you are going without them!’ (2pl)(1362)xyi'tsİ o'ja-e'te-xa-'ra
(*o'ja?e'texaxa'ra)
you.PL leave-COMIT-AS-IMP
‘you are going with them!’ (2pl)These examples show that in contrast to the declarative, where unmarked person represents third person, the default value of the imperative is second per
182.According to MA this answer is a bit harsh. Nicer is: tsy're ‘would it be?’3025. The verb phraseson. The second person plural imperative is marked by -xa-, and this form contrasts with second person plural form -xa-xa- of the declarative and other
moods. The following examples represent strong evidence for this:
(1363)(1364)xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-ra
you
hit-AS-IMP
‘you hit!’vs.xyi'tsİ 'mİ̘-xa-xa-ki
you
hit-2-AS-DEC
‘you hit’xyi aky-'ta
e'mã-xa-xa-ta o'ja-xa-ra
more-2-AS-CSO leave-AS-IMP
you two-ANI
‘you three, go to Barroso!’Ba'hozo-na
Barroso-LOCAs explained in (5.1.), the element -xa-xa- consists of the second person element -xa- and a homophonous associated person marker -xa-. Considering the
fact that second person is zero-marked for the singular subject of the imperative, it is likely that it is also zero-marked for a plural subject. Therefore, the
element -xa- in the second person plural imperative represents associated person, and not second person.
In spite of the fact that -xa- in most imperative sentences represents a plural
subject, there are examples of the imperative in which -xa- is used for second
person singular. In the next example, which is from a mythical tale, the enchanted tapir is being addressed by a group of women:
(1365)huruja=du'hͿ-İteja-xa-ra
like=all-1PO-2-IMP
‘make love to us all!’ (t)Compare this example to (1356). The tapir from this tale is a singular being
with a solitary life. And far as I am aware no special register was used in this
tale. Therefore, I have interpreted -xa- as a second person subject marker.
Imperative verbs were never attested bearing any other subject person
marking than either zero or -xa-. Imperative verbs can be marked for any kind
of object and the same forms are used as in the declarative, with one exception.
The declarative first person object -ta- corresponds to the imperative (and
monitory) first person singular object -ta?Ϳ-:
(1366)wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra (*wadytara)

‘give it to me!’(1367)(1368)oi'tsi-ta?Ϳ-'ra

([jawÓihÓ'tãsa'4a])
see-NOM-1SO-AS-IMP
‘help!’ (lit. ‘you pl. look at me!’)303The negative imperative is expressed by a different morpheme -ky, which
will be treated in (5.2.7.). Nevertheless, some instances of a negative morpheme in combination with imperative -ra were attested. They are rather emphatic:
(1371)ehͿ-'he-ca-ra
make-NEG-EMP-IMP
‘don’t do that!’(1372)ja-'he-ca-xa-ra
eat-NEG-EMP-2-IMP
‘(since you didn’t work)
you (PL) are nót going to eat!’Note that -ra is not immediately attached to negative -he- in this construction.
The intervening element -ca- will be discussed below in section (5.2.3.3.).
5.2.3.1. -tsy- as an imperative element
No mitigated version of the imperative has been identified with absolute certainty. Sometimes the imperative can be expressed by an alternative construction which involves the potential/future morpheme -tsy-:
(1373)hako're
oja'nͿ-e-ra
/ hako're
tomorrow return-again-IMP/ tomorrow
‘tomorrow you (sg/pl) come again’ojanͿ-'?e-xa-tsy-tse
return-again-2-POT-DECThe next examples show that the alternative imperative construction with potential -tsy- may also be zero marked for second person just like the canonical
imperative construction is (note that both are embedded as reported speech
constructions, see 5.5.11.).
(1374)hã
mǊi-'ra-tsy-le-'hͿ
bõ'rõ-tse
water submerge-IMP-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’(1375)hã

bõ'rõ-tse
water submerge-POT-DEC-GER-FRUST-NOM perforate-DEC
‘he ordered me to fetch water, but there is a hole (in the bucket)’3045. The verb phraseThe difference between overt and zero marked second person in the imperative
construction with potential -tsy- is discussed in section (8.1.1.1.).
The consultant regarded the imperative content of the alternative expressions as equally strong or equally nice. On one occasion, however, the potential
construction was indicated as a mitigated and possibly euphemistic alternative
to the imperative:
(1376)wayrjͿ-'ra
clean-IMP
‘clean!’/way'rjͿ-xa-tsy-tsİ
clean-2-POT-DEC
‘you may clean’5.2.3.2. -ta as an imperative element
The procrastinative morpheme -tara- ‘later’, ‘do first’ was discussed above and
demonstrated in example (1268). In the declarative it cannot precede -ki but
only -tsİ. In the imperative it can only be succeeded by a verb-final element -ta.
This element -ta is not a cosubordinative marker, as it is clearly imperative in
combination with -tara-.
(1377)e'hͿ-tara-'ta
make-PROC-IMP
‘do that first! (before going away)’(1378)ka'we 'kui-tara-'ta
(1379)
coffeedrink-PROC-IMP
‘drink coffee first!, wait for the coffee!’here?ece-'hͿ-tara-'ta
rest-NOM-PROC-IMP
‘rest first!’Maybe -ta should be regarded as an allomorph of -ra, although it only occurs in
this construction. The morpheme -tara- is involved in several different constructions and will be treated by itself in section (5.5.19.).
5.2.3.3. The problem of imperative -ca
Imperative -ra may be preceded by the element -ca-, which is usually pronounced as [ta] but sometimes also as [tja]. Out of considerations which will be
explained towards the end of this section, I have provisionally identified -ca- as
an emphatic morpheme.
There are several verb stems which allow the application of -ca- in the imperative without any obvious semantic or pragmatic consequences. The only
consequence -ca- seems to have in the next example is the shift of stress:5.2. Mood(1380)koreja'ro waja-'ra
pan
bring-IMP
‘take the pan!’(1381)'cutse(')rjͿ-(ca)-'ra
lie-EMP-IMP
‘stay lying down!’/
/305koreja'ro wa'ja-ca-ra
pan
bring-EMP-IMPWith some verbs the element -ca- seems to have an effect on the meaning of
the utterance. In the next examples it is hard to determine what is the exact nature of this effect, because the demonstrative ayhͿ ‘that one (close to hearer)’
may co-determine the effect:
(1382)ay'hͿ dai-'ra
that grab-IMP
‘take thát one (which
we know, close or not)’(1383)ay'hͿ 'dai-ca-ra
that grab-EMP-IMP
‘take this one there! (i.e. the
one over there close to you)’Notice that besides the stress shift, the demonstrative in the latter example received extra heavy and probably emphatic or contrastive stress. This may confirm the suspicion that -ca- has an emphatic function. The next two examples
were considered as fully equivalent by MA, but to ZE there was a difference in
emphasis:
(1384)koreja'ro wa'ja-nͿ-'ra
pan
bring-REF-IMP
‘bring here the pan!’(1385)koreja'ro waja-'nͿ-ca-'ra
pan
bring-REF-EMP-IMP
‘I’m telling you, bring here the
pan (I’ve asked you before)!’The distinction between less emphatic and more emphatic literal equivalents of
the last example also involves -ca-, besides the combination of the nominaliser
plus the resignation morpheme -hͿ-tsy which may have emphatic and/or past
connotations (see 5.5.17.). Example (1387) is clearly an emphatic cleft construction:
(1386)koreja'ro
waja-nͿ-'ra-da-hͿ-tsy
pan
bring-REF-IMP-1S-NOM-RES
‘I said to you bring the pan!’(1387)koreja'ro
waja-'nͿ-ca-ra
jã-hͿ-'tsy
pan
bring-REF-EMP-IMP be-NOM-RES
‘I’m telling you bring here the pan (I’ve asked you before)!’3065. The verb phraseWith certain verbs the use of -ca- was considered correct by some people, but
incorrect by others. The next example was rejected by ZE, but accepted by
MA:
(1388)txu'hǊi mãmã'ñe-(*)ca-ra
small
sing-EMP-IMP
‘sing a little!’On one occasion the presence of -ca- was considered as correct, and on the next
occasion it was considered as incorrect by the very same person (MA):
(1389)'diri-(*)ca-'ra
descend-EMP-IMP
‘get out of the hammock!’Sometimes, the application of -ca- was allowed in one construction, but not in
another one:
(1390)'nãi-ca-ra
like-EMP-IMP
‘do like that!’(1391)magariDa-dy'nͿ nãi-(*ca)-'ra
Margarida-COMIT like-EMP-IMP
‘do it with Margarida!’Not all imperative verbs seem to allow the application of -ca-:
(1392)hy'hyrwa'ra
hu'huira
ka'we kui'ra
‘mİ̘'ra
tomã'ra‘walk!’
(*hy'hyrwaca'ra)
‘beat him!’
(*hu'huicara)
‘drink coffee!’ (*ka'we kuica'ra)
‘hit him!’
(*'mİ̘cara)
‘take a bath!’ (*tomaca'ra)In some rare instances there is a lexical semantic difference between imperative
with and without -ca-:
(1393)'aru'ra
a'ruca'ra‘cross!’
‘jump!’(1394)kurira
ku'rica'ra‘quiet! (don’t move)’
‘quiet! (don’t speak)’(1395)koreja'ro warja'ra
‘take the pan with you!’
koreja'ro wa'rjacara ‘hold the pan! (for me)’There are some possible explanations for the consultants’ different opinions
about the applicability and meaning of -ca-. It is quite possible that the dialect
of MA, who is from the mixed family I, has changed because of intensive con5.2. Mood307tact with the surrounding languages in the indigenous reserve. A related possibility is that there is more uncertainty among family I about the use of -ca-, and
that this is due to phenomena of linguistic attrition or obsolescence. Family II
forms a more closed and less plurilingual community in which Kwaza is the
only language used on a daily basis among all members. Another, important
complementary explanation is that the use of -ca- depends less on semantic
factors than on pragmatic factors, and that my methodology of direct elicitation
and translation of short phrases outside of a discourse context is wrong because
it does not make visible the function of -ca-. For the time being I am inclined to
attach most value to ZE’s remarks about -ca- and consider it as an emphatic
marker used in the imperative.
Note that the element -ca- is never used in combination with any other
mood morpheme than -ra and the cosubordinative. In the next example -caoccurs in a phrase cosubordinated to an imperative matrix phrase:
(1396)nãi-ca-ta
oce-'ra
like-EMP-CSO throw-IMP
‘throw it away like that!’Finally, note that -ca- succeeds the element -he- in an emphatic negative
construction in examples (1371) and (1372). This is also the only construction
in which -ca- is preceded by person marking.
5.2.3.4. Imperative particles
The combination of the elements -ca- and -ra is also used independently in elliptic constructions (see also 7.5.2.):
(1397)R:ja-'e-da-mͿ
eat-again-1S-VOL
‘I’m going to eat again’A:ca-'raEMP-IMP‘do that!’, ‘yes!’The answer to the remark can be said to derive from the expression ja'?eca'ra
‘eat again!’ of which the stem is omitted. It is likely that this ellipsis led to the
emergence of an auxiliary-like verbal particle cara ‘order, send’:
(1398)zjwãu ca-'ra 'ta-ta-ki
João EMP-IMP say-1O-DEC
‘João sent me’ (lit. ‘João said “go!” to me’)(1399)zjwãu-'wã ca-'ra 'ta-da-ki
EMP-IMP say-1S-DEC
João-AO
‘I sent João’3085. The verb phraseIn a similar fashion the verb-like particle ratja ‘order him’, ‘insist’ must
have emerged. In this case the imperative morpheme -ra functions as the root,
in a fixed combination with -tja-, which probably originates from a transitiviser. ratja- shows more resemblance to a normal transitive verb stem than does
cara:

The verb-final exhortative morpheme -ni is pronounced as [ni] or [nƭ]. It can be
applied to verbs cross-referring to the first person inclusive subject by -a-, indefinite subject by -wa and zero-marked third person subject.

‘let’s extinguish the candle so they can get some sleep!’In other constructions -ni may be considered as a purposive or causational modal morpheme: -nƭ- ‘to make (someone do something)’, which is pronounced
[nƭ] rather than [ni]. It occurs often, but not necessarily, in subordinate constructions and it has a valency-increasing effect:

the embedded agentive subject of the verb root. In (1419) subject of onİ- ‘to

onİnƭ- ‘to make him come’ is. Compare the following examples:

Ǌi-'nƭ-da-ta

hack-REF-1S-DEC
‘I cut myself (on purpose)’(1429)hadai-'nƭ-da-ki
hack-CAUS-1S-DEC
‘I cut myself (by accident)’Because this construction involving -nƭ- is the result of post-cliticising complementation similar to the reported speech construction, it will also be discussed in (5.5.15.). The causational construction resembles the volitional construction with -damͿ- ‘to want’ discussed in (5.2.5.1.). An important difference
is that the causational morpheme is never preceded by subject crossreference.183
5.2.4.2. Exhortative paucal -jaAn alternative exhortative construction involving the element -ja(-) is suspected to have a paucal connotation.

"Valency and valency changeIn the present section, valency and valency change are discussed. Kwaza verbs
need not be explicitly marked for a specific valency value. Also, verbs need not
be subcategorised for a specific number of arguments. This will be exemplified
in subsection (5.4.1.). Although a number of verbs are neutral or unmarked
with respect to valency, many verbs can be explicitly transitivised or detransitivised through suffixes. These are suffixes which introduce or remove an object. In subsection (5.4.2.) those morphemes are discussed which usually only
have a transitivising function; -ta-, -tja-, -xotİ- and -nͿdwatİ-. There are also
valency changing suffixes which have clear additional functions such as causative. The following morphemes are discussed in the various subsections:
causative -dy- (5.4.3.); benefactive =wady- (5.4.4.); detrimental -ty- (5.4.5.);
reflexive and middle -nͿ- (5.4.6.); reciprocal -lİ- (5.4.7.); comitative -ete(5.4.8.); and valency changing effects of -hͿ- (5.4.9.). A very limited subset of
verbs is subcategorised for argument number, i.e. they require either singular or
plural arguments. They are treated in the final subsection (5.4.10.).
5.4.1. Number of arguments

Kwaza has semantically intransitive verbs. They are subcategorised for only
one argument. Examples are listed below:
(1706)atsi'lebaye'mãemǊ'hͿ-‘to be heavy’
‘to be sour’
‘to weep’
‘to be wet’ku'ryo'ritãitsǊ-‘to row’
‘to climb’
‘to be hard, to be tough’
‘to swim’Some intransitive verbs can be regarded as impersonal because they never take
an independent subject or object:
(1707)a'webİ'rİkara'jakyry'jaty'jetsi?a'rjͿwİ'ro-‘to rain’
‘exploding of thunder with lightning’
‘to be the dry season’
‘rumbling of thunder with rain’
‘to stop raining’
‘to be silent’
‘flashing of lightning’Kwaza also has semantically transitive verbs, which are subcategorised for two
arguments: subject and object. Some of them are listed below:
(1708)daidiha'dohã'tsǊmİ̘ro'roitsİ̘itsu'kuwa'txi-‘to take, to grab something’
‘to break something’
‘to pierce something’
‘to skin an animal’
‘to beat someone’
‘to mash something’
‘to tear something’
‘to chew, to hold something inside the mouth’
‘to collect, to pick up something’A few verbs were attested which appear to be potentially ditransitive:
(1709)haiwa'dy-‘to water, to give liquid to someone, to drench’
‘to give something to someone’5.4. Valency and valency change357The following example illustrates the verb hai- ‘to drench’:
(1710)mƭu-(*ko) marju-'wã 'hai-da-ki
chicha-INS Mario-AO drench-1S-DEC
‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’220The fact that mƭu ‘chicha’ cannot receive instrumental case marking indicates
probably that it is the direct object here. Compare this to the following example:
(1711)keimǊ-(ko) marijaDite-'wã
haje-'kai-da-ki
Maria.Edite-AO smear-CL:leg-1S-DEC
oil-INS
‘I put oil on Maria Edite’s leg’In this example instrumental marking is optional. At one stage the consultant
explained about such arguments that “they are more correct with -ko but if you
are lazy or you don’t feel like talking, you leave it out”. Therefore, I have not
considered the omission of (optional) local case marking of one of the arguments as very strong proof for formal (di-)transitivity (see the related discussion in 4.1.3.).
The verbs listed above do not require any special morphological marking in
order to be used with the number of arguments for which they are subcategorised. Furthermore, the valency of many transitive verbs can be decreased
without any further morphological adaptation. Verbs such as ãwͿi- ‘to see’,
hyri- ‘to steal’, kui- ‘to drink’, wady- ‘to give’, etc. can be used both transitively or intransitively.
So far, one verb was attested which is inherently reflexive: hoñͅ- ‘to hide
oneself’.
5.4.2. Transitivisers
Kwaza has two important transitivising morphemes, -ta- and -tja-, and three
marginal ones, -xote-, -dwate- and -xete-. In the following three subsections
these will be discussed.
The morphemes -ta- and -tja- have in common that they can be applied to
both intransitive and transitive predicates and that they either introduce an (extra) object or bring into focus the transitivity of the verb or its object. Apparently they have no clear semantic effect on the predicate. Although many questions have remained that require further systematic research, both the form and
the behaviour of these two morphemes are strongly reminiscent of applicativelike morphemes in other Amazonian languages.

"8.1. The form -tsy-611Potential verbs nominalised by the morpheme -wy ‘time’ may function as an
adverb or an adverbial clause with a future temporal sense:
(3247)da'nͿ awe-'he-tsy-wy
still rain-NEG-POT-time
‘before it may rain’a'we hã'rã-tsy-wy
rain stop-POT-time
‘after the rain’Potential verbs nominalised by -hͿ occur as nouns or as adverbial clauses with
a purposive function:

pile-DR:onto-1S-POT-NOM
table
make=bring-IMP thing
‘make a table for me to put the things on’These examples show how the verb stem of the purposive adverbial clause retains its valency, and may have embedded lexical arguments. On a morphological level, these are arguments of that verb stem. However, the internal syntactic structure of the purposive clause is identical to that of a nominal modification construction in which the dependent and the (omissible) head are juxtaposed (see 4.3. and 8.4.1.5.). On a sentence level the adverbial clause is a beneficiary argument satellite of the matrix verb. In the following purposive clauses
the lexical heads represent the subject, object and instrumental satellite arguments, respectively, of the verb stem embedded in the dependent:

‘grubs to breed grubs with’In the following example the object of the matrix verb could be regarded as the
subject of the purposive clause, although this clause can also be regarded exclusively as an adverbial phrase:
(3254)e-si'ki
'bİta-'nã-da-ki
ka'ra-tsy-hͿ
Ø-CL:skin hang-FUT-1S-DEC dry-POT-NOM
‘I’m going to hang out the clothes to dry’In the following example the object of the cosubordinated clause is identical to
the subject of the verbal root of the purposive nominal which functions as the
stem of the matrix verb (‘João’):
(3255)talo-'tja-dy-ta
'İ-tsy-hͿ-ki
zjwãu
sulk-TRA-DS-CSO go-POT-NOM-DEC João
‘by sulking (ignoring him) she made João go away’A literal reading of this example could be: ‘she sulked with João in order for
him to leave’, and the effect appears to be causative.352
The contrast between the next two examples shows that, instead of nominaliser -hͿ, a specific classifier (see 4.2.) can be applied. This faculty of classifiers to represent specific nominals morphologically, is interconnected with the
phenomenon of omissible heads. The result is an even more synthetic construction in which the head (‘board’) has in a sense “incorporated” the descriptive dependent (‘for you to make a house’):
(3256)a'xy-dy-'xa-tsy-tse
house-CAU-2-POT-DEC
‘you are going to make a house’(3257)a'xy-dy-'xa-tsy-ka'nİ
a'wͿi-da-ki
house-CAU-2-POT-CL:oblong see-1S-DEC
‘I saw boards for you to make a house with’Notice that the latter example does not contain an adverbial clause. It illustrates
that a nominalised potential verb may have an internally purposive meaning,
even although on the sentential level it may be just a Patiens object argument of
the matrix verb. The next example illustrates that this “incorporation” also ap
352.In an alternative analysis, -tsy- can be interpreted as gerundial, which would yield the
translation ‘the fact that he is/was treated bad is/was a reason for João to leave’. It is
difficult to say what the best interpretation is.","[648, 649, 650]"
"1144. The noun phrase4.1.1.3. Verbs which contain classifiers
Also the animate objects of transitive verbs which contain classifying morphemes do get -wã, whether the classifier is lexicalised to the verb stem, as
seems a likely explanation for -ro in (127), or when it is not, as in (147):
(146) luzeu-'wã hãrǊ'ro-da-ki
Luzeu-AO strangle-1S-DEC
‘I strangled Luzeu’(147) zjwãu-'wã hado-'ri-da-ki
João-AO

‘I pierced João through the chest’(148) marija'Dite-wã haje-'kai-da-ki

‘I smeared oil on the leg of Maria Edite’
(149) (axy(*-wã)) haje-'hͿ-da-ki
house(-AO) smear-NOM-1S-DEC
‘I painted (the house)’
In the above examples one could argue that the animate objects are indirect
objects. Some verbs which contain classifiers do not allow case marked objects
at all, however, whether direct or indirect, whether animate or inanimate:
(150) wara-'hͿ-da-ki

There are some transitive verbs of which the animate object is only optionally
marked:
(157) deda(-'wã)
ha'dai-da-ki
anaconda-AO cut-1S-DEC
‘I cut up the snake’(158) hu'ri(-wã) oxote-'hͿ-da-ki

‘what a pity he left his wife!’
(163) zjwãu pedro-'wã txa kui-he'ta-tsİ
João Pedro-AO tea drink-DESI-DEC
‘João wants Pedro to drink tea (but he is not saying it)’
(164) (zjwãu peDro(-wã)) kui-he'ta-tse.
drink-DESI-DEC
João
Pedro-AO
‘he (João) wants him (Pedro) to drink’
But often this optionality is not unconditional:
(165) zjwãu(-'wã) butxi-'nã-da-ki
free-FUT-1S-DEC
João-AO
‘I’m going to free João’(166) xyi-'wã butxi-'nã-da-ki
you-AO free-FUT-1S-DEC
‘I’m going to free you’If the object of the latter example were not marked for case it would make the
impression of a second person singular subject with wrong cross-reference
marking on the verb.
With regard to the following examples, it may be that there is a different
sense involved in the presence and absence of -wã:
(167) zjwãu(-wã) axe'hͿ-da-ki
find-1S-DEC
João-AO
‘I met (with) João’(168) si(-wã)-'e
I-AO-too
‘I want (for me) too’1164. The noun phraseDepending on the verb stem to which it is applied, the (transitivising) verbal
morpheme -tja- (see 5.4.2.2.), which probably introduces objects of reason,
may allow or may require that the object is case marked with -wã. In the following examples, case marking is optional:
(169) hu'ri(-wã) Ǌ'ca-da-ki
ambush-1S-DEC
paca-AO
‘I’m hiding from the paca (ready to get it)’
(170) hai'munDa(-'wã) we-'tja-da-ta
fear-TRA-1S-CSO
Raimunda-AO
‘I tremble with fear for Raimunda’dyry'ry-da-ki
tremble-1S-DECIn example (171) below and (1744) in section (5.4.2.2.), the obligatory combination of -tja- together with case marking yields a specific or determinate
sense:
(171) de'da
'we-ki /
anaconda fear-DEC /
‘the snake is afraid’'we-tse
fear-DEC(172) deda-'wã
we-'tja-ki
anaconda-AO fear-TRA-DEC
‘he is afraid of the snake’ (“only when seeing it”, not in general)
Comparing the following examples, the combination of -tja- with case marking
is dependent on animacy:
(173) wãwãwͿ-tja-'hͿ-da-ki
magariDa-'wã
Margarida-AO
dream-TRA-NOM-1S-DEC
‘I dreamt of Margarida’ (-wã required because object is a person)

tsǊrǊrǊ'nƭ(-wã)
sand-AO
Mario dream-TRA-NOM-DEC
‘Mario is dreaming of sand’ (-wã optional because not a person)
In the following examples containing -tja- applied to verbs of saying and ordering, the object is obligatorily marked for case:

4.1.1.5. Interrogative objects marked by -wã

words to be marked with -wã:

The verb phrase
Kwaza verbs can be morphologically highly complex and there are many different suffixes. A verb in Kwaza consists minimally of a bound root and
obligatory person and mood suffixes. Between the root and the obligatory suffixes other, optional, suffixes may be inserted. The obligatory suffixes, which
can only be omitted when the speech context allows, are considered as inflexional. The optional suffixes are considered as derivational. Their occurrence
depends on the specific state of affairs as described or expressed by the utterance.
The distinction between derivation and inflexion is not clear-cut. Valency
changing suffixes, aspectual suffixes, directionals and the like are optional, and
could be considered as derivational. Subject cross-reference151 markers and
mood markers are obligatory and could be considered as inflexional. Modal
suffixes and object cross-reference markers are to a certain extent optional and
they take a position inside the word between the derivational and inflexional
suffixes.
Although I do not make an explicit and categorical formal distinction between derivational and inflexional morphemes, I do distinguish different types
of suffixes on the basis of an intuitive notion of the distinction. This is reflected
in the order by which the verbal morphemes will be treated in the subsequent
sections. First I will discuss the most inflexional of the suffixes, the person
cross-reference markers, in (5.1.). Mood (i.e. illocution) markers, which can
also be considered as inflexional, are discussed in (5.2.). Then, more derivational-like morphemes are discussed, such as directional morphemes in (5.3.),
valency changing suffixes in (5.4.), tense, modality and aspect morphemes in
(5.5.) and nominalisers in (5.6.).
Even though negation in Kwaza can be considered as a verbal derivational
process, I have, because of its special formal and pragmatic characteristics,
relegated it to (7.1.).
I regard those roots as verbal which are morphologically bound. From the
point of view of morphology, Kwaza verbs are not complete words if a nominaliser, or person and mood marking is absent. In essence, “incomplete” stems
are not well-formed in Kwaza. Nevertheless, ellipsis of person and mood
marking occurs in certain contexts. This is discussed in another chapter, in
(7.5.).
Semantically, verbal roots are either attributive or predicative. Kwaza verb
roots contrast morphologically with noun roots in that Kwaza nouns can occur
151.In this work I have used the term “cross-reference” as in Shopen (1985) in the sense
of “agreement” or “concord”.","[278, 279, 280, 281]"

-siNominal clausesBesides adverbial clauses and cosubordinated verbal clauses, Kwaza also has
complex constructions which contain nominal clauses. These nominal clauses
are the result of nominalisation. They can be internally very complex with embedded arguments and all. There are two types of nominalisation which lead to
two different types of nominal clauses. The nominaliser -hͿ creates nouns
which may function as arguments of a matrix predicate or as modifiers of other
nouns. I have called them attributive clauses and they will be discussed in
(8.4.1.) below. The nominaliser -nãi creates nouns which may function as
complements (especially of verbs of cognition), or as adverbs. In section
(8.4.2.) I will discuss -nãi only as a complement formative, while its adverbial
functions were discussed in (6.2.4.2.) and (8.2.6.). Finally in (8.4.3.) I will discuss overlap between the functions of -hͿ and -nãi.
8.4.1. Attributive clauses
Kwaza does neither have adjectives, nor does it have relative pronouns. Instead, nouns can be modified by other nouns or nominal clauses through the
means of juxtaposition. This property of attributive modification is treated extensively in (4.3.). In (5.6.) the nominaliser -hͿ was discussed. It derives nouns
from verb stems or verbal expressions of any degree of internal complexity.
Through nominalisation of verbal clauses by -hͿ, highly complex nominal expressions can be formed. Such expressions may function as attributive clauses,
comparable to relative clauses in other languages. The attributive clause is a
dependent that modifies a juxtaposed head and forms an attributive construction together with that head. Attributive constructions function as arguments of
the matrix verb. Compare the following examples:

i'si-tse (3627)

The head of an attributive construction may be an argument of the verbal root
of the dependent modifying attributive clause. In Kwaza, there are two arguments which are in this manner “accessible to relativisation” (see Keenan and
Comrie 1977): subject and object. In (3627) and the subsequent examples, the
head of the attributive construction is the subject of the verbal root of the modifier:

(3637)'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-hͿ
board
house-CAU-1P-NOM
‘boards to build a house’395One construction was attested in which the head seems to be a locative satellite (which avails itself of the instrumental case, see 4.1.3.1.):
(3638)txu'hǊi
small'enǊ
barrierti-nãi-'hͿ
what-NOM-NOMhu'ri ('ja-tsy-hͿ)
paca eat-GER-NOMharu'rai
'ja-tsy-hͿ-ko
armadillo eat-GER-NOM-INS
‘the small barrier where the paca eats, and the armadillo’ (t)
In this example a locative satellite appears as accessible to “relativisation”.
However, this example represents the only attested instance of its kind, and it is
not certain whether it is correct and in which way it should be analysed.
In Kwaza no systematic distinction is made between a nominalised verb that
functions as a dependent modifier of its subject and one that functions as a dependent modifier of its object. In fact there is no formal distinction at all between subject and object “relativisation”. This is further shown and discussed
in section (8.4.1.4.) below.
8.4.1.2. Headless attributive clauses
Besides juxtaposition, another property of attributive modification that is also
attested for attributive clauses is the fact that the head of the attributive construction can be “omitted”. Apparently, headlessness is optional:
(3639)a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki
(tswa) 'mİ̘-hata-hͿ
hit-3S.2O-NOM

‘I saw that one (man) who beat you’396395.The order 21 is also allowed.
396.Note the inverse: 'mİ̘-da-hͿ-ki
a'wͿi-hata-hͿ
hit-1S-NOM-DEC see-3S.2O-NOM
‘I beat that one who looked at you’6908. Subordination and coordinationThe following example lacks in principle an overt subject head, i.e. the “person” which killed the pig:
(3640)dutu're hu'hui-ty-hata-hͿ
axe'hͿ-da-ki
pig
beat-DET-3S.2O-NOM find-1S-DEC
‘I encountered that one who killed your pig’The following example contains an idiomatic pattern for a certain type of expression.397 The attributive clause which is employed lacks in principle an overt
subject head of its embedded verb, i.e. “you”:
(3641)e'tay-xa-re
cutsikja-ro'tİ-xa-hͿ
woman-2-INT stand-CL:door-2-NOM
‘are you a woman, the way you keep standing in the doorway?’398In this and in other headless types of expression, there may be an overt object
not representing a head:
(3642)ka'tay-xa-re
kǊ'cͅ
ja-xa-'hͿ
agouti-2-INT brazil.nut eat-2-NOM
‘are you an agouti, that you are eating (so many) Brazil nuts?’In the next example, the “omitted”, or perhaps better “understood” head is also
the subject, i.e. the “thing” which kills while the object “rat” is overtly present:
(3643)waru'ka huhui=a'sa-a-hͿ
rat
kill=leave-1P-NOM
‘do you have a rat trap?’e-xa-'re
have-2-INTThe contrast between the subsequent examples demonstrates the omission of an
overt object head:
(3644)ay-'hͿ

‘that one called “puppet”‘, ‘that one they call “puppet”‘ (t)(3645)tã'jã ta-wa-'hͿ
chief talk-IS-NOM
‘the one whom they call “chief”‘, ‘the one called “chief”‘397.This does not imply that the occurrence of headless attributive clauses is limited to
idiomatic expressions.

"6668. Subordination and coordinationHowever, the medial clause can also have a purposive sense without such
means, aside from its purely consecutive function:
(3525)pİ̘rİ̘jã-'tja-da-ta
oja'nͿ-da-ki
arrive-1S-DEC
speak-TRA-1S-DEC
‘I talked to him and I came’ (i.e. I came authorised)(3526)pİ̘rİ̘jã-tja-'ja-da-ta
oja'nͿ-da-ki
arrive-1S-DEC
speak-TRA-IO-1S-DEC
‘I came here to talk with them’ (i.e. I came here for us to talk)As suggested in the introduction, a clause ending in a cosubordinate mood
marker may also function as an adverbial clause:
(3527)txu'hǊi-tja hǊnǊ-'dy-da-ki
small-CSO scorch-CAU-1S-DEC
‘I burnt the food (just) a little’(3528)txu'hǊi-tja a'we-tse
small-CSO rain-DEC
‘it rained a little’Notice that it is not really possible to speak of same subject medial clauses in
(3527) and (3528), because the matrix subject is different from that of the medial clause. Furthermore, this subject discontinuity is not marked in the expected manner as discussed in (8.3.2.). These adverbial clauses are probably
subordinate clauses which modify the verb root of the matrix clause only. They
do not cosubordinate a second proposition to the matrix clause proposition, like
medial clauses do.
Cosubordinate mood verbs which are used in coordinative constructions are
discussed in (8.3.1.10.).
8.3.1.8. Some morphosyntactic aspects of cosubordination
The linear order of cosubordinated clauses does not seem to be so strict that the
matrix clause always has to follow the medial clause. Compare example (3473)
to the following:
(3529)dodotxi'te ohui-'nã-tja
o'ja-tse
ball
play-FUT-CSO leave-DEC
‘he went there to play ball’381According to the consultant, there was no meaning difference between the alternative orders. In the following examples, the order is iconic:381.Alternative order: 312.","[703, 704]"
"NegationNegation is expressed principally by a verbal suffix -he-. Its use and the different positions it can take inside the word will be discussed in section (7.1.1.). In
addition to the negation suffix, an emphatic marker with a negative effect has
been identified. It may be related to the adverb ƭ ‘idly’ and it is discussed in
(7.1.2.). Finally, the negative habitual morpheme -hͿsi, which replaces the
verb’s mood marker, is dealt with in (7.1.3.).
Besides these negative elements there are three specific prohibitive moods.
These are not treated here extensively, but in the chapter on mood, in sections
(5.2.7-10.).
7.1.1. The negative suffix -heThe negative suffix -he- occurs in two different basic types of constructions.
One expresses straightforward negation, and the other involves a counter of
presupposition. These constructions are formally distinct. In the negative construction, the suffix -he- attracts stress, it occurs in a position between the verb
root and person inflexion, and if the subject is a zero-marked third person, the
declarative mood marker is -tse. In the countersupposition construction, the
suffix -he- does not bear stress, it occurs in the position between person inflexion and the mood marker, and the declarative mood marker is -ki under all
circumstances. This situation can be schematised as follows:5207. Other morphosyntactic structuresTable 30. The negative suffix -he- in the declarative mood

‘V-Ø-he-kiThe negative construction will be discussed in subsection (7.1.1.1.) and countersupposition in (7.1.1.2.). The other subsections deal with issues involving
the negative, which do not depend exclusively on the distinction between these
basic constructions. With respect to the formal expression of this distinction
Kwaza seems to be very rare among the Amazonian languages (see van der
Voort 2002b). Alternative placements of the negative and other morphemes
such as derivational future -nã- have been seldomly attested and have not yet
been the object of research.
7.1.1.1. Negation by -heNegation of predicates and propositions is realised through the bound verbal
morpheme -he-. In this construction, the negative suffix usually precedes person and mood marking:

‘he hops, he limps’ (t)Cases of double negation inside the word have not been found. Repetition of
the negative suffix is not possible:
(2767)*hoi-he-he-tsesweet-NEG-NEG-DECThe antonyms of some verbs are expressed through litotes, i.e. by negation of the root through -he-:
(2768)tãi-ki

‘it is hard’tãi-'he-tse
hard-NEG-DEC
‘it is soft’(2769)by'ru-ki

It could be that in some verbs there is a lexicalised negative element, e.g.
hedutu- ‘lose’; hetxa- ‘bar’; hewedutu- ‘forget’; he?ai- ‘want not’.
Some verbs contain the element -he- as an integral part of the root, but it has
nothing to do with the negative morpheme:5227. Other morphosyntactic structures(2770)de'he-ki
bitter-DEC
‘it tastes bitter, strong, dry’dehe-'he-tse
bitter-NEG-DEC
‘it isn’t bitter’There is no lexical root *de-.
7.1.1.2. The counter of presupposition by -he
In the countersupposition construction, the negative morpheme is found in a
different position, after person inflexion. Furthermore, the negator does not
tend to attract stress (whereas the mood marker sometimes does). Compare the
following examples and notice the difference in meaning:
(2771)kawİ
kui-'he-da-ki
coffee drink-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I did not drink coffee (yet)’(2772)kawİ
'kui-da-he-ki
coffee drink-1S-NEG-DEC
‘I’m not drinking coffee (but something else)’294Apparently, the order in which the negative precedes the person marker indicates negation of the action expressed by the verb root. The reverse order, person-negative, seems to indicate negation of the object of the verb. A somewhat
similar difference may be observed between the following examples:
(2773)awͿi-'he-(c)wa-ki
(2774)
see-NEG-IS-DEC
‘he did not see’,
‘they are not watching now’a'wͿi-wa-he-ki
see-IS-NEG-DEC
‘they did not look’,
‘he didn’t (go there to) have a look’The following example shows how satellites marked by oblique case are contrasted in the countersupposition construction:
(2775)kuja'ba-na
oja-da-'he,
vilena-ko-'le
leave-IS-NEG Vilhena-INS-only
Cuiabá-LOC
‘I didn’t go to Cuiabá, only to Vilhena’Note that this example, which is from family II, is elliptic since the mood
marker is absent, and it forms an exception to the statement that the negative
does not attract stress in the countersupposition construction.
294.Unfortunately, main stress placement in the word kawİ was not registered. Here it is
probably on the first syllable and in the previous example on the second syllable.","[557, 558, 559, 560]"

The element [!İte] resembles the comitative morpheme -ete- (see 5.4.8.),
but there is no reason to suppose that they are productively related. When the
comitative morpheme is followed by the indefinite object marker -ja- the composite meaning does not correspond to ‘first person plural object’:

‘Arino hides you (PL)’Although this form is not further analysable, the element -ete- also occurs in
the first person “plural” object form -eteja- and in both forms it can be also
pronounced as [İte] and [Ite]. It bears a strong resemblance to the comitative
morpheme -ete-. At one point the consultant said that addition of the verb duhͿ‘all’ as in example (1058) is superfluous here, because this sense is included in
-etelexwa-. A more literal translation of -etelexwa- may then be something like
‘you together’. The consultant apparently made a comparable association and
translated etelexwa in isolation as ‘with you (PL)’.155 In spite of these considerations, if the element -ete- can be related to the comitative morpheme, it is
lexicalised. The following example illustrates how the intransitive verb “dance”
requires a comitative morpheme in order to acquire a comitative sense:
155.He confirmed that it cannot be used as a separate word. It is unclear, however, what
the consultant regards as a “separate word”. He or she may use a pragmatic criterion
and correctly argue that one cannot utter a word like “you” or “house” in isolation.","[288, 289]"
"8.4. Nominal clauses691The next example also lacks an overt object head, i.e. “door”, which was
woven (by an indefinite subject, that is) out of braided palm leaves and which
is used to close things:
(3646)hetsy'se-ko ce-wa-'hͿ
ku'ro-wa-hͿ
broom-INS weave-IS-NOM close-IS-NOM
‘(door) braided out of palm leaves to close off things’The following examples lack in principle both an overt object head and an
overt embedded subject:
(3647)Ǌcenãi-'he-xa-hͿ
ere'we-xa-ki
write-2-DEC
know-NEG-2-NOM
‘what you don’t know you’re writing’(3648)cari=a'sa-(wa)-hͿ
e'xyi=exyi='le-Ϳ-ki
shoot=leave-IS-NOM hair=hair-only-ATT-DEC
‘him whom they killed had very long hair’In (3647), the nominal clause, with the understood object “unknown things”
and the understood subject “you”, functions as an object in the matrix clause.
In (3648) the nominal clause, with the understood object “victim” and the understood subject “killer”, functions as a subject in the matrix clause.
The Kwaza property of attribution, which allows omission of a head is related without doubt to the property of predication that allows the omission of
overt arguments. Also the possibility of zero-verbalisation has a nominal
equivalent. The following example contains what can be regarded as an inherently headless attributive clause, c.q. zero-modification:
(3649)mãrİ̘ri'tsa-wa-hͿ kwİ'nİ-wa-ki
enter-IS-DEC
person-IS-NOM
‘someone has entered here (while we were away)’Remember that Kwaza does not have an indefinite pronoun. The literal translation of the subject mãrİ̘ritsawahͿ is ‘an indefinite being who is a person’ or
‘indefinite beings who are persons’. It is based on the zero-verbalisation
mãrİ̘ritsawaki ‘they are persons’ of the noun mãrİ̘ritsa ‘person’. On the other
hand, nominalisation of zero-verbalised nouns is not really a special grammatical category by itself. The next example shows that such nominalisations can
be headed too:6928. Subordination and coordination(3650)dutu're

nͿhͿ-tsy-'hͿ
kill-1P-CSO big-GER-NOMkahİ=ka'hİ-ja-ta
bite=bite-IO-CSO
‘we kill peccary pigs, the big ones who bite people’ (t)
The nominal clause duture hajeretsyhͿ means literally ‘wild pigs which are
peccaries (Tayassu tayacu)’.
Note that in many of the headless structures given here, the actual presence
of an overt head was never attested. The use of overt heads in these cases
would probably not be felt as a “natural” way of speaking.
8.4.1.3. Case marking in attributive clauses
The following example shows clearly how an attributive clause modifies a
noun with which it is juxtaposed.
(3651)emǊtay-ku'ty=txuhǊi eto'hoi ohuini-'hͿ
play-NOM
glass-CL:head=small child
‘a small glass marble for children to play (with)’There is no morphological indication that the head of the attributive construction in the above example, “small glass marble”, is an object argument of the
embedded verb “play”. This is according to expectations, because Kwaza has
only animate object case. Furthermore, the verb ohuini- does not require “instrumental” objects to be case marked.
Animate objects may receive the case marker -wã, also when embedded in
attributive clauses. The following example contains a “relativised subject”, i.e.,
the head of the attributive clause is equivalent with the subject of the embedded
verb root:
(3652)etohoi-'wã jere'xwa
ka'hİ-tsy-hͿ
a'wͿi-da-ki
jaguar
bite-GER-NOM see-1S-DEC
child-AO
‘I saw the dog which bit the child’In this example only the noun which is embedded as an object inside the attributive clause receives case. The next example shows a “relativised object”. It
should receive animate object case at least because of its object function inside
the attributive clause. However, this is not what happens:
(3653)jere'xwa
eto'hoi ka'hİ-hͿ
a'wͿi-da-ki
jaguar
child
bite-NOM see-1S-DEC
‘I saw the child which was bitten by the dog’8.4. Nominal clauses693Apparently, the head of an attributive clause does not receive case marking
even when it represents an animate object of the nominalised predicate.
Example (3653) suggests at the same time that complex attributive clauses
do not receive animate object marking even when they represent an animate
object of the matrix predicate. However, this does not always seem to be the
situation. In the following example a (headless) relative clause si hurujadahͿwã ‘the one I loved’ is marked as an animate object of the verb cari?asa‘kill and do away with’:
(3654)xyi-'dy-hͿ
a'ha
you-POS-NOM fathersi huru'ja-da-hͿ-wã
I like-1S-NOM-AOca'ri=asa-ty-ta-tay-hͿ-'ki

he?ai-'tja-da-ki
you-POS-NOM-AO not.want-TRA-1S-DEC
‘because your father killed from me the one I loved, I don’t want your
one (i.e. your father)’ (t)
For -wã, see (4.1.1.).
In the next examples, attributive clauses are marked because of their status
with regard to the matrix predicate for instrumental case and locative case respectively:
(3655)'ywynwͿ
'bukja-hͿ-ko 'bu=Ǌ-rjͿ-ta
put=be-CD:area-CSO

kara-ko'ro-tsy-hͿ-'na
mau'ru
tree
dry-Cl:arm-GER-NOM-LOC woodpecker
‘woodpecker lives in a dry tree’s branch’'Ǌ-ki
be-DECThese examples suggest that case marking of complex nominals is expressed
on the dependent or on the last concomitant. As an alternative translation of
(3656), ‘tree, in the dry branch of which the woodpecker lives’ is not correct
because the verb “live” (lit. ‘be located, sit’) is not embedded in the attributive
clause. It is not certain whether such a construction is possible at all, since the
one presented in (3638) is doubtful.
8.4.1.4. Context dependent heads
As explained in (5.6.1.), the fact that verbs can be ambiguous with respect to
their valency and the types of arguments they take, may have very unpredict6948. Subordination and coordinationable effects on the result of their nominalisation by -hͿ. Consequently, it is not
always foreseeable which argument will be accessed by an attributive clause.
Furthermore, the application of an indefinite subject marker may interfere in an
equally unpredictable manner. As an example, the verb root hãtsǊ- ‘to skin’
may be active in the sense that a subject may tear off skin, with either skin itself or the animal from which the skin is taken as object. Or it may be mediopassive in that the subject may be the skin itself, which hangs loose, and an
object may be the animal or the body part from which the skin lets loose. Compare the subsequent six examples:
(3657)'hãtsǊ-da-ki
skin-1S-DEC
‘I’m skinning, I’m pulling the skin’(3658)hãtsǊ-ko'je-ta-ki
skin-CL:hand-1O-DEC
‘the skin hung loose/was torn off my hand/a blister developed’In the next example, the nominalised verb represents the active subject:
(3659)a'wͿi-da-ki ay-'hͿ
tswa dutu're
see-1S-DEC that-NOM man pig
‘I saw that man who skinned the pig’hã'tsǊ-hͿ
skin-NOMIn the next example, an indefinite subject marker (see 5.1.4.1.) occurs and the
nominalised verb represents a patient object:
(3660)ay-'hͿ
a'wͿi-da-ki dutu're
that-NOM see-1S-DEC pig
‘I saw that pig that they skinned’hã'tsǊ-wa-hͿ
skin-IS-NOMHowever, in the following example, the very same nominalised verb form as in
(3660) represents the active subject again (and in the form of a headless attributive clause):
(3661)dutu're hã'tsǊ-wa-hͿ
pig
skin-IS-NOM
‘the one who skinned the pig’Finally, the nominalised verb form is identical to the one encountered in (3659)
but it represents the product of skinning either as a direct object or as a subject
in a headless attributive clause, while there is an embedded patient as an indirect object:8.4. Nominal clauses(3662)695dutu're hãtsǊ-'hͿ
pig
skin-NOM
‘skin torn from the pig’It appears that form and function do not correspond systematically here. Maybe
the interpretation of the head of the attributive clause depends to a great extent
on the context.
8.4.1.5. Multiple attributive relationships
When transitive verb phrases with two overt arguments are nominalised, the
modifying relations may become double-layered. In the next example jerexwa
‘jaguar’ is both the object of the matrix verb awͿi- ‘see’ and the subject of the
embedded verb dwͿ- ‘break’. The object of dwͿ- is ekai ‘leg’:
(3663)jere'xwa 'ekai 'dwͿ-hͿ
a'wͿi-da-ki
jaguar leg break-NOM see-1S-DEC
‘I saw the/a broken-legged dog’The entire internally complex nominal clause is an object argument of the verb
awͿi-. The internal structure of this object may be viewed from two different
perspectives. The grammatical relationships can be regarded as attributive, in
which perspective the head jerexwa ‘dog’ is juxtaposed with a dependent modifier. This modifier is internally complex as it contains an embedded object:
ekai ‘leg’. An alternative way to interpret this structure is predicative. In that
perspective the example represents a nominalisation of an entire verb phrase
with two embedded arguments. A third interpretation combines the different
perspectives. The difference between these approaches can be illustrated
through a contrast between bracketing structures which symbolise the different
embedding relations. In this notation, the elements that modify one another
through means of juxtaposition are separated by square brackets:
a)[[jerexwa] [[ekai] [dwͿ-hͿ]]]
‘broken-legged dog’b)[[jerexwa] [[ekai dwͿ]-hͿ]]
‘dog which has a broken leg’c)[[jerexwa ekai dwͿ]-hͿ]
‘dog which has a leg which is broken’In analysis (3663a), dwͿhͿ modifies its object ekai, the result of which, ekai
dwͿhͿ, means ‘broken leg’. This entire phrase again forms a nominal modifier
to its subject jerexwa and bears the sense of ‘broken-legged’. However, in6968. Subordination and coordinationanalysis (3663c) there are no modifying relationships at all; only the argument
relationships. (3663b) represents an intermediate analysis. These three representations reflect different possible interpretations of the relationships within
the nominal clause. As far as the attributive relationships are concerned, the example is ambiguous between (3663a) and (3663b). In view of the basic property of attributive constructions, that is, modification is realised through juxtaposition, it is not necessary to assume a big scope for the nominaliser -hͿ.
Therefore I tend to consider (3663a) to represent the most plausible analysis.
8.4.1.6. Restriction in attributive clauses
Many attributive clauses in the present section are restrictive. In these clauses
the modifier provides specifications which restrict the number of possible referents of the (zero) head. There is no special grammatical device which indicates the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive attributive clauses.
Non-restrictive attribution was attested for non-third person subject headless
attributive clauses in (3641) and (3642). The following example represents a
third person subject attributive clause that can only be non-restrictive:
(3664)a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki
zjwãu
'kwİ-ta
enter-CSO
see-1S-NOM-DEC João
‘I saw João enter and break a cup’'kopu
cup'kãu=asa-hͿ
break=leave-NOMObviously, further restriction of the embedded subject zjwãu is not relevant
here. The sentence was elicited as a translation of a Portuguese sentence containing a complement clause. The next example was given by the consultant as
a fully equivalent alternative:
(3665)a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki
zjwãu
'kwİ-ta
'kopu

‘I saw that João entered and broke a cup’'kãu=asa-nãi

in Kwaza, which is discussed in (8.4.2.). Apparently, examples (3664) and
(3665) illustrate a functional overlap in Kwaza between attributive and complement clauses. Note that no such pair was attested for the attributive function
since -nãi is never used as an attributive clause. This matter is pursued further
with more examples in (8.4.3.) below.
In addition to the non-restrictive interpretation of the attributive clause
proper, which seems to be possible only to a limited extent, there is also a strategy to express this function through a medial clause. Compare the following
restrictive attributive clause construction to its subsequent non-restrictive
equivalent:8.4. Nominal clauses(3666)Ǌce'nãi-hͿ 'ja-ki
atxi'txi
know-NOM eat-DEC maize
‘wise men eat maize’(3667)Ǌce'nãi-hͿ-ta
'ja-ki
atxi'txi
know-NOM-CSO eat-DEC maize
‘men, because they are wise, eat maize’697Whereas the subject of (3666) is a headless attributive clause which represents
that subject, in (3667) the subject is not expressed at all. The attributive clause
of the former is zero-verbalised as a medial clause in the latter. Of course, nonthird person equivalents of this medial clause construction are possible:
(3668)si 'tswa-da-hͿ-ta
da'rje-da-ki
I man-1S-NOM-CSO strong-1S-DEC
‘being a man I’m strong’
(lit. ‘it being the case that I am a man I’m strong’)Medial clauses are discussed exhaustively in (8.3.), zero-verbalisation is discussed in (4.4.9.). Attributive constructions are also discussed in van der Voort
(fca).
8.4.2. Complement clauses
Kwaza has neither infinitive verb forms nor complementisers. Instead, verbal
phrases can function as complement sentences after nominalisation. In (5.6.)
the nominaliser -nãi was discussed. Like -hͿ, it derives nouns from verbal roots
of any degree of internal complexity. However, whereas -hͿ produces nouns
which refer to participants of events, -nãi produces nouns which refer to the
events themselves. Through nominalisation of verbal clauses by -nãi, highly
complex nouns can be formed which may function as complement clauses.
These complement clauses function as arguments of the matrix verb and resemble the infinitives of other languages.
Verbs ending in -nãi function often as complements of verbs of cognition
like “like”, “know”, “forget”, “see” etc.:

"5.1. Person cross-reference271It appears that -ja-, although being an object marker itself, can occur together
with another, definite object marker in one word:
(1188)axehͿ-ja-'he-eteja-ki
find-IO-NEG-1PO-DEC
‘he did not meet us’Note that both object markers are separated by a negative morpheme and that
-ja- precedes it. This can be seen as a case of recursive derivation, and it may
indicate that -ja- is derived on a deeper level than the subsequent elements. A
likely interpretation would be ‘he met no-one of us’ or ‘he did not meet anyone
with respect to us’. This also suggests that -ja- is not a constituing part of
-İteja-. Maybe -ja- is lexicalised with the verb root as axehͿja- ‘meet’.
The indefinite object morpheme has clearly a plural connotation in the following example:
(1189)e'tay-nahere-wã wa'dy-ja-ra
woman-COL-AO give-IO-IMP
‘give (it) to all women!’It is not clear whether the second occurrence of -ja- in the third phrase below represents a second instance of indefinite object marking:
(1190)wady-'ja-da-ki
‘I gave to them’
wady-'ja-du'hͿ-da-ki
‘I gave all to them’
wady-'ja-duhͿ-'ja-da-ki ‘I gave all to them all’Even though the following example involves a definite subject, -ja- is applied. It is probably lexicalised with the root asa- ‘to leave’ as a euphemism:
(1191)asa-'ja-da-ki
leave-IO-1S-DEC
‘I buried him’Some verbs contain a root-final element -ja-, which may originate from the
indefinite object morpheme, but which is completely lexicalised. Semantically
it does not refer to an indefinite object. As an example xareja- ‘search things’
does take overt definite objects: ui xare'jadaki ‘I’m looking for the tobacco’. In
order to refer to an indefinite object the addition of -ja- is required:
(1192)xareja-'ja-da-ki
(1193)

‘I’m searching (many) people’waja-'ja-he-tsy-tse
bring-IO-NEG-POT-DEC
‘he is not going to bring anyone’2725. The verb phrase5.1.4.3. Extension to inclusive object reference
Some translations provided by the consultant suggest that, in the proper context, a first person object can be “understood” and be expressed by the indefinite object morpheme -ja-:
(1194)'a-ty-ja-ki
exist-DET-IO-DEC
‘there was for us’(1195)o'tsi-ja-ki
fall-IO-DEC
‘it fell on top of us’(1196)axe'hͿ-ja-ki
find-IO-DEC
‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)In fact, the example (1196) was presented in a first person inclusive context,
whereas contrasted with a first person exclusive context the consultant offered
the following Kwaza equivalent:
(1197)axe'hͿ-e'teja-ki
find-1PO-DEC
‘he met (us)’ (accidentally on the road)These examples represent the only attested pair in which a contrast between inclusive and exclusive first person interpretations of object cross-reference
markers can be suspected. Now remember from example (1177) above that,
against expectations, the indefinite object marker -ja- can be followed by the
special declarative marker -tse. So, when inquiring about a truly indefinite object equivalent of (1196) the following sentence was offered:
(1198)axehͿ-'ja-tse
find-IO-DEC
‘he met them’As a consequence, two apparent anomalies with respect to the expected behaviour of object cross-reference; an inclusive reading (of -ja-) and a combination (of -ja-) with the morpheme -tse, may be related in that they work together
to enable both the expression of an inclusive object and of a true indefinite object. In view of the fact that these are the only clear examples encountered, it
may not be the case that the distinctions discussed here are fully grammaticalised. Example (1094) above forms evidence for the fact that -eteja- may
cross-refer to an inclusive pronoun. Furthermore, the verb axehͿ- ‘find’ may be
ideosyncratic. Nevertheless, about the following examples it was said that they
have the same meaning, but that the second alternative was “better”:5.1. Person cross-reference(1199)'mİ̘-ja-wa-ki
hit-IO-IS-DEC
‘they hit us’(1200)273mİ̘-'eteja-wa-ki
hit-1PO-IS-DEC
‘they hit us’In case the first alternative involves an inclusive first person object, it may have
been considered as less felicitous because it is less easy to imagine a proper
pragmatic context for uttering it.
5.1.5. Impersonal reference
The category of impersonal subject reference on verbs has been attested in the
speech of several consultants from both families. There are no impersonal pronouns,160 but there is a cross-reference affix -na- (also pronounced as [nã])
which refers to an impersonal plural subject, and by extension to a first person
plural subject ‘one, we’. Its occurrence is not very frequent and its nature is not
fully understood.
(1201)o'kja-na-ki
hunt-one-DEC
‘we are/one is hunting’The impersonal has usually inclusive meaning. The speech contexts of following examples show a contrast to this effect:
(1202)unͿte'ta-a-xa-ki
(1203) unͿte'ta-na-ki
converse-one-DEC
converse-1P-AS-DEC
‘we are talking’
‘we are talking’
(CX: and what about you?) (CX: pay attention, you were sleeping!)One consultant notably translated the impersonal using the Portuguese speakerinclusive impersonal a gente ‘one (including I)’, which is opposed to Portuguese o pessoal ‘one (excluding I)’.

"6768. Subordination and coordinationits position after -hͿ-, however, it is more likely that -dy- is a different subject
morpheme here (the nominaliser -hͿ- may have a clefting function, see 5.5.20.).
8.3.2.1.2. Functions of different subject clauses
As was demonstrated in (8.3.1.7.) the medial clause may function as a complement of cause or reason. This is also true for medial clauses marked for different third person subject:

‘(as) it was raining much, he was planting/planted maize’8.3.2.1.3. Different subject clauses and comparison

grammatical analysis probably warrants the conclusion that it represents the
different subject marker:8.3. Cosubordination: medial clauses(3577)677wanã'dy txu'hǊi-Ϳ-dy-ta

eat-NEG-DEC
food
small-ATT-DS-CSO
‘there remained just a little food for him, he didn’t eat’388Notice furthermore the discussion about the examples of (8.3.2.1.1.) in which
-dy- may originate from a metaphorical use of the benefactive. It is possible
that the two categories of benefactive/causative and different subject are related
in some way. About the following example, it cannot be denied that the logical
subject of the verb root are- ‘transform’ is different from that of oja- ‘leave’:
(3578)ã'rǊi are-dy-da-'ta
o'ja-da-ki
tapir turn-CAU-1S-CSO leave-1S-DEC
‘I made him turn into a tapir and I went away’Because of the fact that the formal subjects of the concomitant clauses in this
example are identical, non-third persons, the element -dy- is to be interpreted as
a causative marker.
A clear formal difference between both morphemes may be that causative
-dy- tends to attract stress, whereas the different subject morpheme does not.389
My teacher MA pointed out to me the possibility of the following minimal pair:
(3579)cu-'dy-ta
cut-CAU-CSO
‘he ordered him to cut’'cu-dy-ta
cut-DS-CSO
‘he cut, and then...’He considered the similarity between these phrases as striking but said that they
were totally different in nature.
The following example contains a verb in which both the causative morpheme and the different subject marker cooccur:
(3580)diri-'dy-dy-ta
a'wͿi-ta
see-CSO
descend-CAU-DS-CSO
‘she(i) made him descend and she(j) saw him’ (t)Maybe one could say that causative -dy- causes a switch of subjects within the
verb stem, and different subject -dy- causes a switch of subjects across a complex clause construction.388.‘ficou pouquinho para ele, não comeu’
389.Since it does not even receive secondary stress, the different subject marker is often
almost inaudible in narrative texts and its presence can be reconstructed from a
pause.","[713, 714, 715]"
"CompositionIn Kwaza, compounding of two or more verb roots, which is discussed in section (7.4.1.), is fairly common. It may refer to sequences of different events,
but it may also have a more grammatical function and refer to a single event.
Compounding of roots from other categories, which is discussed in (7.4.2.), is
rare. Negation in compounds has already been discussed in (7.1.1.6.). Reduplication, classification and directionality are regarded in the present work as distinct from compounding.
7.4.1. Verbal compounds
Compounding of verb roots is a very common and productive way to link up
events in Kwaza. Verbal inflexion is marked only on the last member of the
compound. Consider the following examples:
(3035)kuri=tsi'kja-da-ki
(3036)
stop=stand-1S-DEC
‘I stopped, and stayed put’kui='hay-da-ki
drink=cut.off-1S-DEC
‘I drank until half (the glass)’(3037)konajã'dy=a-tsy-wy
ace'rjͿ-ki
nigh-DEC
sweat=exist-POT-time
‘the hot rainy season is coming’ (lit. ‘the time of sweat is nigh’)5687. Other morphosyntactic structuresThe first member of a compound may be morphologically complex to some
extent:
(3038)kawİ
'kui-e=a-tsy-wy
ace'rjͿ-ki
coffee drink-again=exist-POT-time nigh-DEC
‘coffee-time is arriving’(3039)cari-'ty=asa-a-ni
kill-DET=leave-1P-EXH
‘let’s kill him off!’ (t)(3040)cari-'nã=asa-le-hͿ
tsoho'roi=oja-hͿ-lİ
kill-FUT=leave-FRUST-NOM run=go-NOM-PREC
‘wanting to kill it, however, it got away, then’ (t)(3041)nͿ-hͿ=txu'hǊi-tse
big-NOM=small-DEC
‘it is somewhat big’ (but not very big)There are several different kinds of relationships between compounded roots.
This depends on the semantics of the concerned roots and on the relative order
of the concomitants of the compound structure. The compound may reflect a
sequence of events:
(3042)towİ=ca'we-ki
break=go.down-DEC
‘he broke branch and fell down’(3043)jere'xwa
wãwͿi=tu'ru-tja nwã'rã 'dai=warja-ta
jaguar
sleep=wake-CSO cudgel take=bring-CSO
‘jaguar slept, woke up and took a wooden machete’ (t)The internal order of sequential compounds is iconic. Depending on the semantics of the verb root, some orders are logically excluded:
(3044)terja=hy'ja=tse
slide.down=fall-DEC
‘he slipped and fell’(3045)*?hy'ja=te'rja-tse
fall=slide.down-DEC
‘he fell and slipped’Nevertheless, the order can be reversed, in accordance with an alternative
course of events. This may lead to somewhat different lexicalised meanings. In
the following examples, the verb root buru- ‘to pass or visit a place which is
inhabited by people’ is combined with the verb root oja- ‘to go away, leave’, in
different orders:7.4. Composition(3046)ay-'rjͿ

buru=o'ja-ki
pass=go-DEC
that-CD:area
‘he passed by there’ (he did not stop)569Serial compounds may have a purposive sense:
(3048)ja=Ǌi-a-'ni-tse
eat=lie-1P-EXH-DEC
‘she says let’s eat so that we can go to sleep’(3049)onİ='kui-da-mͿ

see=go-DEC
‘he went there to see’(3051)mã=audy'nİ̘-ki
call=make.return-DEC
‘she called him back’Not all compounds are sequential, since some compounds refer to synchronic
events:

‘he went down’ywynwͿ-simjã'ku 'dy=asa-xa-xa-ki

(3055)
write=walk-1S-DEC
‘I’m writing while walking’erewexy=hǊ'dwa-da-ki
write=sit-1S-DEC
‘I’m writing sitting’Sometimes compounds may be regarded as consisting of a predicate and its
verbal complement:
(3056)'mİ̘-e-dy-ta

beat-again-DS-CSO cry=stop-CSO
‘when he beat again, she just stopped crying’ (t)(3057)areta=mã-'he-da-ki
know=call-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I don’t know how to call it’5707. Other morphosyntactic structuresWhen one of the members of a compound is semantically attributive, it modifies the other member, as if it were an adverb:
(3058)wai=txu'hǊi-tse
good=small-DEC
‘it got a little better’(3059)tyka?o=txu'hǊi-tara-mͿ
visit.far=small-PROC-VOL
‘I’m going to visit far away people a little’(3060)be='hİ-dy-'hͿ-ta-ki
black=paint-CAU-NOM-1O-DEC
‘I’m painted black (with genipap) by someone’Several verb roots with a relatively abstract meaning occur so frequently as
a second element in a verbal compound that they are like suffixes. The root
kwİ- ‘to enter’ was illustrated in (5.3.1.) to function often in the same way as a
directional morpheme. Note the following “illative” compound:
(3061)towİ='kwİ-tja
go=enter-CSO
‘they went into (the forest, house, corral etc.)’ (t)The verb root asa- ‘to end, leave behind, separate from’ is usually a second
element in a compound verb and adds a terminative meaning ‘into bits, into
oblivion, away’:
(3062)do'te=asa-hͿ-ki
shed=leave-NOM-DEC
‘leak empty’(3063)ha'dai=asa-xa-tsy-tse
hack.up=leave-2-POT-DEC

'dy=asa-wa-ki
tree
cut=leave-IS-DEC
‘they cut the log in order to clear it out of the way’As mentioned in (5.4.10.), asa- has a singular object. Its plural equivalent ujais also usually compounded:
(3065)ywy'nwͿ
'dy=uja-wa-ki
tree
cut=leave-IS-DEC
‘they cut the many logs in order to clear them out of the way’Similarly, the verb root bwa- ‘to end, finish’ adds a completive meaning as a
second member in a compound:7.4. Composition(3066)'boi-dy=bwa-dy-'ra
full-CAU=end-CAU-IMP
‘fill it up for him!’(3067)571ba='bwa-cwa-ki
cut=finish-IS-DEC
‘they finished clearing a field’Also the verb hãrã- ‘to stop’, as in (3056), is used as a second element with an
aspectual meaning. This was also discussed in (5.5.23.).
The benefactive function of the verb root wady- ‘to give’ as a second member of a compound was discussed in section (5.4.4.). Here, a few examples will
suffice:
(3068)ui
kurje=wa'dy-nƭnã-da-ki
tobacco wind=give-2O-1S-DEC
‘I rolled a cigarette for you’(3070)lonã-'na
hy=kwİ=wa'dy-da-ki
hole-LOC go=enter=give-1S-DEC
‘I entered into the hole for him’(3069)kwe=wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-ra
string=give-1SO-IMP
‘string it for me!’Some compound constructions, like those involving wady- ‘give’, are like serial verbs: they contain several verbs, but they refer to a single event. The following examples contain constructions which also seem to represent “serial
compounds”:
(3071)i'tsosisi 'dy=wanİ-ra

revolt=go-CL:woman-COL
‘the runaway women’Compounds involving the verb root wanİ- ‘bring’ may have a similar function
as with wady- ‘give’, but not as regular and as abstract. They should probably
not be regarded as serial compounds:

'dy=wanİ-ra (3075)
Ø-CL:skin cut=bring-IMP
‘cut and give me a piece of cloth!’coha-si'ki
'dai=wanİ-ra

definiteness and the applicative. In Kwaza, when applied to the ambitransitive
verb we- ‘to fear’, the combination of -tja- together with case marking yields a
specific or determinate sense (see also 4.1.1.4.):

‘he saw me steal and went after me and beat me’It is likely that -tja- resembles -ta- in that it may both introduce an object and
put focus on the object or on the transitivity of the verb.
The transitiviser -tja- appears to be lexicalised with some verbs (both in the
forms -ca- and -tja-):
(1749)dudu'tja-‘to close, finish all’
‘to fill’(1750)ǊǊ'ca-‘to be, stand, sit’
‘to lie in ambush (for an animal)’(1751)*mͿimͿi'ca- ‘to frighten (someone)’224Since the verb root tjata- ‘to say to a person’ has a transitive sense, it is
imaginable that it derives from the verb ta- ‘to say, talk’, transitivised by the
element -tja- as a prefix:
(1752)tja'ta-ta-tsy-tse
say-1O-POT-DEC
‘he is going to talk with me’However, the root tjata- ‘say’ and the relatively fixed expressions tjara ‘do it!’
and ratja- ‘to order (someone)’ originate probably from the combined processes of ellipsis and cliticisation. It follows from the discussion in (5.5.11.1.)
and (7.5.2.) that the cosubordinative marker -tja- seems to be a more likely
candidate for identification with the “prefix”.
5.4.2.3. Transitivisers -xote-, -dwate- and -xete
Three other overt transitivising morphemes may be distinguished, although
they are not very productive; -xote-, -dwate- and -xete. Transitiviser -xote- has
been attested with only two verbs so far: ka?awanihͿ- ‘to worry, suffer’ and
tutunitahͿ- ‘to think, worry’. Without -xotİ- these verbs are considered as intransitive.
224.The intransitive counterpart of the verb mͿica- is mİ̘jã- ‘to be startled’. It might be
etymologically related when we assume that -tja- truncated the final syllable of
mİ̘jã-. Thereafter metathesis involving the palatal may have occurred (see also
2.15.).","[399, 400, 401]"
"CaseKwaza does not make a clear-cut obligatory morphological distinction between
the subject and object function of nouns or pronouns. Nevertheless, Kwaza
nouns may be inflected for case.
There is one case which is partially the consequence of a syntactic government relation between verb and argument. It is expressed by the suffix -wã,
which I have termed the “animate object” case.
Furthermore, there is a small number of “local” or “oblique” case markers
which express semantic relations between the verb and optional nominal satellites. The suffix -na expresses “locative” case, -ko expresses “instrumental” and
“locative”, -du expresses “beneficiary” and -dynͿ expresses “comitative”.
Kwaza does not have adpositions.
4.1.1. Animate object -wã
The animate object case ending -wã marks certain animate non-subjects of
transitive verbs. It is applied under circumstances that are not fully clear. Often
it attracts stress.
With most verbs, the animate object marker is obligatory for animate nouns
in direct object function:1064. The noun phrase(66) jere'xwa 'kay-ki

Besides indicating which animate argument is object, the case marker -wã also
has the effect of disambiguating between subject and object itself, especially
when both are third person arguments:

The case marker is not always absolutely indispensable to distinguish between

subject cross-reference marker is zero, but for first and second persons it is not

been sufficient for the identification of subjects and objects:

Note that the following examples do not contain -wã, whereas all involve overt
subject cross-reference. However, disambiguation is not the principal function
of -wã. Comparison with the previous examples, where there is both crossreference and case marking, shows that -wã rather marks the object as animate.
Since the principal function of -wã is animate object case marking, its application is ungrammatical with inanimate objects, which apparently includes plants,
seeds etc.:

On several occasions during more recent fieldwork the distincion was spontaneously made explicit by the consultant. With respect to the impossibility of
-wã in the following example, which I had smuggled into my repetition of it,

examples where the subject is animate and the object inanimate and both are
third persons:4.1. Case109(99) uru'hu xare'ja-ki au

Nevertheless, there are a number of verbs of which even animate objects do not
receive a case marker. In this situation, one could say that only cross-reference
marking disambiguates the sentence. Note the following examples:

‘you are created by/as fish’ (t)
There may even be gradual differences in animacy. The animate object of
some verbs like ca'ri- ‘shoot, kill game’ is not case-marked, unless the object is
a person:
(106) ze'zƭju dutu're ca'ri-ki

In principle, all living animals belong to the Kwaza category of animates, but
vegetable beings and lifeless things do not. Apparently there is uncertainty
whether the moon belongs to the animate category:89. The last word of this sentence may, alternatively, also have been Ǌce'nãi-ki

"1364. The noun phrase(317) haki.'dwa nͿ-'dwa-ki
stone.stone big-CL:stone-DEC
‘the stone is big’
The word ha'ki ‘stone’ is considered as obsolete nowadays, but it was used by
the old people, and closely similar forms are found in Aikanã (ha'ži) and Kanoê
(a'ki) today.
The unidentifiable root kaxa- may be etymologically related to verbs like
kay- ‘scratch’, kakani- ‘itch’.
Some verbs also contain lexicalised classifiers, such as -ro ‘cup, container’
in the verb root bobo'ro- ‘make dents’. The element -ro- cannot be omitted nor
replaced by another classifier.
4.2.1.11. Free lexical forms and the empty root
In Kwaza, a classifier is a bound morpheme that never occurs by itself as an independent word. The closest it can get to independent occurrence is when attached to the empty word-formative root e-. In this position, classifiers create a
general or a prototypical noun belonging to the corresponding class.

Ø-CL:flat
‘(its) liver’(322) e-'tay
Ø-CL:woman
‘woman, wife’(320) e-'kai
Ø-CL:leg
‘(its) lower leg’The empty root in Kwaza often occurs in words which denote things or beings
which are part of something. For example, there is no “leg” without it being the
leg of someone. However, there is no systematic contrast between alienable
and inalienable possession involving the respective absence or presence of the
prefix e-. In case the empty root would once have had its origin in inalienability
phenomena as in Tupi languages (e.g. Gavião in Moore 1984:146-152 and
Mekens in Galucio 2001:32-33), no such distinction belongs to the grammar of
Kwaza today. The empty root strongly resembles the Kanoê prefix i-, both in
form, function and distribution. This prefix is provisionally analysed in Bacelar
(2004) as an element to express inalienability, but there are also alienable items
where it occurs and inalienable items where it does not occur.
A practically identical root ƭ- is mentioned for Latundê (Northern Nambikwara) in Telles (2002a:96) where it is analysed as a semantically empty root
that lends independent nominal status to bound classifier morphemes in the
very same way. The empty root is also strikingly similar in form and use to the
prefix e- in Tacanan languages, such as Ese Eja (Chavarría 2000) and Cavineña4.2. Class137(Guillaume 2004) where it occurs in the same position with the same function.
The empty root may be an areal trait (see van der Voort fcb). It is absent in Aikanã.
On a synchronic level, and unlike the other languages of the region, the
empty root e- can be associated with the verb root e- ‘to have’ in Kwaza. There
is a parallel with the word-formative empty root a- in Kwaza to which directional morphemes can be attached in order to form adverbs. That root can be
associated with the verb root a- ‘to have’ (see 6.2.1.). I have seen no equivalents of this in other languages, even though there are also directionals in Kanoê.
4.2.2. The types of classifiers
The morphemes illustrated above appear to behave like classifiers, but are they
truly classifiers? The answer to this question is important for the assessment of
the nature of Kwaza morphology. Many Kwaza classifiers behave as if they
were the second element in a compound, which is otherwise practically only
attested with Kwaza verbs. In other constructions, the behaviour of classifiers
shows resemblance to incorporation. In order to determine whether some essential differences emerge, I have roughly ordered the morphemes I consider to
be classifiers into sections according to their etymology.
In the very first subsection (4.2.2.1.) I discuss the use of the nominaliser -hͿ
as a neutral classifier. The following three subsections contain an inventory of
all known specific classifiers. In section (4.2.2.2.) I listed the classifiers which
have no fully transparent etymological relation to the nouns they classify. In
the next section (4.2.2.3.) I listed those which seem to be only slightly adapted
or reduced versions of the independent nouns with which they are referentially
identical. The final section (4.2.2.4.) lists those classifiers which can only appear as an independent noun when attached to the empty root e-.
4.2.2.1. The nominaliser -hͿ- as a neutral classifier
The element -hͿ- has many functions, which are probably related to its semantically zero, or “neutral” nature as a classifier. As was illustrated above, it may
have a nominalising effect, and it can be replaced by a specific classifier:
(323) aky'nͿ-day-hͿ
friend-1S-NOM
‘(my) friend’(324) aky'nͿ-xay-tay
friend-2S-CL:woman
‘your FEM friend’The neutral classifier may also have valency changing effects (see 5.4.9.).
These are probably the consequence of the process of incorporation of the classifier into certain verbs. In some cases, the neutral classifier can then be re1384. The noun phraseplaced with a specific classifier. Intransitive verbs like 'ha-ki ‘it is clean’ or
o'xote-ki ‘he is waiting’ can “incorporate” an object in the form of a classifier:
(325) ha-ha-'hͿ-ki
clean-clean-NOM-DEC
‘he washes things’(326) ha-ha-'ro-ki
clean-clean-CL:cup-DEC
‘he washes pans’(327) ônibus(*-wã) oxote-'hͿ-da-ki
wait-NOM-1S-DEC
bus(-AO)
‘I’m waiting for the bus’
The nominaliser -hͿ- may be used to form a clefted construction and thereby
create an intensified sense (see 5.5.20.) which results in comparatives and superlatives:
(328) nͿ-'ro-hͿ-ki
(*nͿro'hͿki)
big-CL:cup-NOM-DEC
‘the cup is bigger / biggest’
This looks like reduplication when the root contains -hͿ- as a neutral classifier:
(329) nͿ-hͿ-'hͿ-ki
big-NOM-NOM-DEC
‘it is bigger / it is the biggest’
Note, however, that the verb root nͿ- without a subsequent classifier means ‘to
be fat’. I regard -hͿ- as semi-lexicalised in the root nͿ-hͿ- ‘to be big’ because
this meaning is retained when -hͿ- is replaced by a specific classifier. There are
in fact many instances of (semi-)lexicalised or lexicalising neutral classifiers. A
more lexicalised example is ku'kui-ki ‘it hurts’ vs. kukui-'hͿ-ki ‘he is ill’. When
the neutral classifier is replaced with a specific classifier the original sense of
the stem returns and a corresponding specific illness has to be expressed in another way:
(330) kukui-ko'ko-ki
kukui-ko'ro-ki
kukui-'tõi-ki
kukui-mjã'ka-ki‘his throat (ekoko) hurts’
‘his arm (tsoro) hurts’
‘his eye (ecõi) hurts’
‘his belly (emjãka) hurts’4.2.2.2. Etymologically opaque classifiers
The following classifiers are at best etymologically only partially related to
certain specific independent nouns.","[173, 174, 175, 176]"
"DirectionalityIn section (4.2.8.) the attachment of classifiers to verb stems was discussed.
There is another type of morphological operation on Kwaza verb stems which
has a spatial or directional function. It replaces case markers and prepositions. I
have called it “directional”, after the terminology used by Craig for a similar
phenomenon in Mayan languages (1979:34) and by Hinton (1994:55-57) in the
native languages of California. An (either optional or obligatory) directional
morpheme specifies the directionality of the activity expressed by typical action, process and motion verbs like “enter”, “take” and “put”. Kwaza directionals are almost exclusively marked on verbs. Some of the morphemes appear to
combine the functions of nominal classification and verbal directionality.
Apart from certain distributional similarities between noun classifiers and
directionals, there is a structural parallellism. Similar to the way in which noun
classifiers can be attached to the empty root e- to form nouns, directionals can
be attached to the empty root a- in order to form adverbs (see 6.2.).
Another characteristic of the application of a directional morpheme is that
the overt lexical expression of a “prepositional object”, which has to be in the
locative or instrumental case, is optional. This reminds one of the optionality of
an overt noun when that noun is specified by its classifier on the verb or on the
modifying dependent nominal. In some instances an overt prepositional object
was even rejected because in the verb, as the consultant explains: “you already
said everything”.
The next subsection contains an inventory of morphemes that have been
identified as directionals by the examples. The subsequent subsection will discuss ambivalent forms which can function both as classifiers and directionals.

occurs in -dwatja- ‘into the forest’.
dwatja ‘into the forest’. This morpheme consists apparently of the abovementioned morpheme -dwa- and the unidentified element -tja-. This latter element
does not occur as such with other directionals. It seems to reinforce the notion
of ‘forest’ observed with respect to examples (1525) and (1526).

from this latter juxtapositive sentence construction. One could imagine that the
root of the verb for ‘to say’ is omitted, and that the remaining context dependent person and mood markers are cliticised to the preceding fully inflected
quoted verb.
Elliptic constructions in which the root of the quoted utterance, or the entire
quoted utterance itself, is omitted occur as well. In the following four examples, the omitted material is represented by “0”.

example:

'ta-wa-si

‘“you don’t want?” they said (to him)’ (t)(2051)kwİ-nİ-he-'ky-tja

enter-DR:hither-NEG-NEI-CSO talk-1S-VOL
‘I’ll tell him not to enter’
(lit. ‘I’m going to talk, saying: “don’t enter!”‘)Note the difference in perspective with the quotation construction:
(2052)ja-'nã-xa-re-tja
'ta-da-ki
talk-1S-DEC
eat-FUT-2-INT-CSO
‘I asked him whether he was going to eat’
(lit. ‘“are you going to eat?” I said (to him)’)(2053)ja-'nã-xa-'re-da-ki
eat-FUT-2-INT-1S-DEC
‘I’m asking you whether you ate’
(lit. ‘“are you going to eat?” I said (to you)’)Note that there are no verbs for ‘allowing’ or ‘forbidding’ in Kwaza. Such
senses are expressed through constructions in which imperatives and negative
imperatives are quoted. The verb root ratja- ‘to order’ and the imperative particle cara (see 5.2.3.4.) are also possible derivations of elliptic quotation constructions. Note the following examples:
(2054)ra'tja-ta-ki

Quotation may represent mental activity, and the quotation construction does
not always concern literally reported speech. In the following examples, the
first person singular interrogative quoted by a first person singular is shown to
have a dubitative or ruminative function:
(2058)wara'ñͿ-e-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
work-again-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
‘I think I’m going to work again’(2059)warañͿ-te'te-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
work-INTENS-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
‘I think I’m really going to work much’(2060)wara'ñͿ-e-nã-da-'hͿ=wara
ti-nãi-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
work-again-FUT-1S-NOM=but what-NOM-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
‘I’m going to work again but I don’t know how to do it’(2061)he?ai-da-tsy-'re-da-ki
want.not-1S-POT-INT-1S-DEC
‘I think I’m going to say no’There is a quotation construction in which the quoting person is a first person singular in a preconditional adverbial clause involving -lİ (see 8.2.1.3.1.):
(2062)kude're korİ-'ki=da-lİ
'ja-da-tsy-tse
Kudere cleave-DEC=1S-PREC eat-1S-POT-DEC
‘(only) if Kudere/Canderé harvests (grubs), I will eat”
(lit. ‘as soon as I’m aware that Kudere harvests, I will eat’)An English equivalent of this construction is probably something in the order
of ‘as far as I am concerned, I will eat if Canderé harvests the grubs’. The preconditional value of the construction in (2062) it probably not very strong.
In section (5.2.2.1.) various constructions in which the interrogative has an
emphatic function are discussed. One of these constructions seems to have extra emphasis when presented as quoted by the first person singular. Note the
following examples:
(2063)kukui 'cu=hy=hy-dwa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
wow step=move=move-DR:onto-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
‘my, what a lot of tracks there were on the road!’5.5. Tense, modality and aspect(2064)ku'kui ja-'re-da-hͿ-ki
wow
eat-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
‘my, what did he eat much!’(2065)ku'kui ja-xa-'re-da-hͿ-ki
wow
eat-2-INT-1S-NOM-DEC
‘my, what did you eat much! / how did you eat!’409Literally, (2065) can be interpreted as ‘it is a fact that I said: “wow!, do/did you
eat?”‘. Such an interpretation resembles partially similar emphatic constructions which consist of first person quotations in English, e.g. ‘I say, you know
how to eat!’.243 Apparently, this construction must contain a first person subject, since otherwise a more literal reading is obtained:
(2066)ku'kui ja-'re-xa-hͿ-ki
wow
eat-INT-2-NOM-DEC
‘you said: “wow, he eats much!”’The quotation construction is probably also the basis of the purposive construction involving -te- (5.5.12.), the desiderative construction involving -heta(5.5.13.), the intentional construction involving -here- (5.5.14.1.) and the construction involving apparential -tehere- (5.5.14.2.).
Finally, the degrammaticalised occurrence of certain mood markers as modality morphemes may also derive from quotation constructions.
5.5.11.3. Indirect speech
When considering the free translation of several examples above, it seems that
Kwaza quoted speech may be semantically ambiguous with respect to the difference between direct and indirect speech. Notice the discrepancy between the
free translation given by the consultant and the literal translation of the following example:
(2067)tsǊhǊ-ra'ti huruja-xa-'re-da-ki
what-FOC like-2-INT-1S-DEC
‘I don’t know what you want’ (lit. ‘I said: “what do you want?”‘)The semantic distinction is not reflected in the grammar of Kwaza. Maybe
there is one construction which comes close to an indirect grammatical way to
quote speech:
243.In the Dutch equivalent there is no quotation structure, but there is an interrogative
pronoun, an optional interrogative intonation, and a first person as a dative object:
wat at je me daar (veel)! (lit. ‘what did you eat me there (much)!’).","[442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447]"
"6.2. Adverbial morphology(2620)497a-ha'kate a-'wy
Ø-ancient exist-time
‘in olden times’ (t)In (4.2.1.5.) the possibility of extending (directional) adverbs with classifiers was mentioned. Such adverbs terminated by classifiers often behave as
nouns:
(2621)tsiritsa-tu-'na
cu'cu-ki
middle-CL:back-LOC walk-DEC
‘he is walking in the middle of the slope’(2622)cucu-ki
*?tsiritsa-tu
middle-CL:back walk-DEC
‘the middle of the slope is walking’In example (2621) the adverb tsiritsa is followed by the classifier -tu- and subsequently by the locative case marker -na. Example (2622) is anomalous precisely because the classified adverb is interpreted as a noun. The following
classified a- initial adverbs can hardly be imagined to have anything else but a
nominal interpretation:
(2623)a-'tatsitswa-kai
Ø-DR:under-CL:leg
‘calf’(2624)a-haka'te-tay
Ø-ancient-CL:woman
‘a woman from olden times’ (t)Nevertheless, classified adverbs were also attested to maintain their adverbial
nature, as is suggested by the following examples:
(2625)a-toto-'xy
aru'nja-leja
'ta-dy-ta
Ø-DR:upward-CL:house leave-2O.FUT talk-DS-CSO
‘“I will put you up in the attic”, she said’ (t)(2626)a-toto-'xy
'bu-dwa-ki
Ø-DR:upward-CL:house put-DR:onto-DEC
‘(the parrot) is sitting on top of the house’Note that adverbs can apparently function as nouns sometimes even without
classifiers. The locative case marker -na in the following example suggests that
the adverb asilona ‘corner of the house’, which is based on the directional
-silona- ‘corner of the house’ is interpreted as a noun:
(2627)a-silona-'na
a'sa-da-ki
Ø-DR:corner-LOC leave-1S-DEC
‘I left the broom in a corner’hetsy'se
broom4986. Adverbs and adverbial expressionsSome directionals were only attested with the prefixed empty root a- when
followed by a subsequent classifier. It is not always clear whether the result is a
noun or an adverb. In the following example, the locative case marker -na is
evidence for the nominal status of aratsamǊ ‘on the bottom of the river:
(2628)a-ratsa-mǊ-'na
tsǊrǊnǊ'nƭ 'a-ki
exist-DEC
Ø-DR:under-CL:liquid-LOC sand
‘there is sand on the bottom of the river’In another word order, however, the (optional?) absence of -na suggests it may
be interpreted as an adverb:
(2629)tsǊrǊnǊ'nƭ 'a-ki
a-ratsa-'mǊ(-na)
sand
exist-DEC Ø-DR:under-CL:liquid-LOC
‘there is sand at the bottom of the river’There is even a verb root tewe- ‘slant, slide down’, which was encountered
with the prefixed empty adverbial root a- only if followed by the classifier -tu‘shoulder, back’:
(2630)a-tewe-'tu
Ø-slant-CL:back
‘slope from one side of the hill over the top down the other side’Because atewe- of example (2630) is not attested without -tu, the combination
can be treated as lexicalised. tewe'tu itself is a noun that means ‘slope, hillside’
and atewe'tu, which means something like ‘down the slope’ can either be used
as a noun or as an adverb:
(2631)a-tewe-'tu
'a-da-ki
Ø-slant-CL:back exist-1S-DEC
‘I live down there at the bottom of the slope’(2632)a-tewe-'tu-na
'a-da-ki
Ø-slant-CL:back-LOC exist-1S-DEC
‘I live on a slope’Adverbial use of a bare verb root without classifiers, directionals or
the
empty prefix a- was also attested, e.g. the verb root takaisa- ‘traverse, divide’.
Furthermore, some bare nouns have been attested to function as adverbs too,
e.g. te'ja ‘(opposite) side of a place (river, settlement, road)’. Both are discussed in (6.2.3.).
In the above it was shown how adverbs may be formed productively by the
semantically void root a-. The other components may be bound directional
morphemes, classifiers, verb roots and even nouns. It was furthermore shown6.2. Adverbial morphology499how adverbs without initial a- may also involve the same components. The fact
that morphologically unmarked category-changing operations are quite productive only adds up to the possibilities. There are situations in which it is very
difficult to determine what the primal grammatical category of a certain lexical
root is, which greatly complicates the establishment of rules for adverb formation and use.
Let me finally address the status of the semantically empty adverbial root aitself. It was noted in (5.3.2.) and (4.2.1.11.) that there was a parallel between
the empty nominal root e- and the empty adverbial root a-. Classifiers can be
attached to e- in order to form independent nouns, and directionals can be attached to a- in order to form independent adverbs. Both e- and a- are homophonous with basic verb roots, to wit e- ‘have’ and a- ‘exist, live, remain, be
born’ respectively. However, the e- and a- roots diverge with respect to their
distributional properties. Of the e- roots the distribution is practically complementary, since the empty root cannot be used with the sense of ‘have’ and since
the classifier cannot represent an incorporated object of the verb root ‘to have’.
Compare the following two examples:280
(2633)e-'tay-da-ki
(2634)
Ø-CL:woman-1S-DEC
‘I’m a woman’ (*’I have a woman’)e-'tay
'e-da-ki
Ø-CL:woman have-1S-DEC
‘I have a woman’The distributional distinction between the two a- roots is not that clear. Consequently, the a- root is sometimes ambiguous. In example (2635) a- seems easily identifiable as the empty adverbial root:
(2635)a-ri'tsa
a'wͿi-da-ki coha-si'ki
Ø-DR:outside see-1S-DEC foot-CL:skin
‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))281Earlier on, we have seen how adverbs can be zero-verbalised, and the result can
be a matrix sentence:
(2636)a-ri'tsa-ki
Ø-DR:outside-DEC
‘he/it is outside’However, one could claim also that (2636) should be analysed in the following
manner:280.Note that these two examples were created by myself.
281.order 213 or any other also allowed5006. Adverbs and adverbial expressions(2637)a-ri'tsa-ki
exist-DR:outside-DEC
‘he/it is outside’Such an analysis becomes even more plausible when it is confirmed by the free
translation given by the consultant:
(2638)a-toto-'mǊ-wa-ki
exist-DR:upward-CL:liquid-IS-DEC
‘they live along the river’Fortunately for the present analysis, both a- roots can usually be kept distinct
on structural and semantic grounds.
6.2.2. Reduplication in adverbs
Adverbs can be extended by full repetition of the adverbial root (see also
7.3.1.). The semantic effect is emphasis or intensification of the meaning original adverb:
(2639)wa'txi zjwãu
hy'ja-re
true
João
fall-INT
‘has João really fallen?’(2640)watxi-wa'txi
ãwͿi-'ra
true-true
see-IMP
‘aim right!’, ‘look well!’Reduplication of an adverb can also have a repetitive effect:
(2641)haja-ha'ja
day-day
‘every day’This is not possible with similar temporal adverbs: *hakorehakore.
Partial reduplication of the adverb txarwa ‘first, now, today’ may go together with the intensifying suffix -te. Compare the following examples:
(2642)txa'rwa 'a-da-hͿ-ki
first
exist-1S-NOM-DEC
‘I’m living here now’Ϳ-hͿ-'ko
this-NOM-LOC6.2. Adverbial morphology(2643)txatxarwa-'tehã'rã-ki
atxi'txi
stop-DEC
maize
‘he’s just stopped planting maize’
RED.first-INTENS501anǊ-'nãi
plant-NOMThe suffix -te, which can be reduplicated itself, is discussed further down below. The partial reduplication in haja'jadyko're ‘tomorrow early’ was discussed
under (2606).
Some adverbs were only attested in a partially reduplicated form, such as
harehareja'wyle ‘(only) after a (long) time’ or ‘just a little while later’:
(2644)sa'mweu aha-tja'te-dynͿ
Samuel father-3POS-COMIT'a=a-ta
exist=exist-CSOharehareja'wyle axe-'rjͿ-tse
long.while
find-CD:area-DEC
‘Samuel lived together with his parents until he found a place of his
own’
The root of this adverb harejawy, in which the suffix -wy ‘time’ can be discerned, was translated by the consultant as ‘late, slow, belated, retarded’ but it
was not considered as an independent word. However, the element -le, which
probably means ‘only, just’ here, was omitted in one instance, and the reduplication involved an even smaller part of the root:
(2645)harereja'wy
tsa'si-ki
long.while
follow-DEC
‘it took him long to come’, ‘he is the last one’6.2.3. Other categories used as adverbs
For other categories to function as adverbs, specific morphological operations
are usually required. As is demonstrated elsewhere (4.4.9.), the possibilities of
zero-derivation in Kwaza allow for many lexical roots to be ambiguous with
regard to their grammatical category. However, there is only a very small number of adverbs which are ambiguous in this respect. Some words used as adverbs may actually be nouns, for example because they end in a classifier.
Other words used as adverbs may be uninflected verb roots but their original
status is difficult to prove.
Some bare nouns have been attested to function as adverbs, e.g. teja ‘(opposite) side of a place (river, settlement, road)’:
(2646)'si-dy-hͿ te'ja
I-POS-NOM side
‘my side’(2647)na-ay-xu'kote'ja 'a-ki
side exist-DEC

Ba'hoso te'ja

‘we started on the side/part/region of Barroso’ (t)If teja would function as a locative satellite, it would have been marked with
the locative morpheme -na. As this is not the case, and because teja is clearly
not an argument of the verb, its function may be considered as adverbial in
these examples.
The noun kohͿtİ ‘thing without (something)’ is a classified nominalisation
of the verb root ko- ‘to be without (something)’. It is regarded as a noun in the
present analysis, but in the following construction it may be regarded as having
both a nominal argument function and an adverbial modification function:
(2650)wa'txi ko-hͿ-'tİ
kui-'nã-tsy-re
drink-FUT-GER-INT
true
without-NOM-NOM
‘is he really going to drink (coffee) without (sugar)?’In the next example there is no doubt that kohͿtİ functions as an adverb, or,
rather, the head of an adverbial clause:
(2651)ma'telu ko-hͿ-'tİ
hammer without-NOM-NOM
‘I hit him without a hammer’hu'hui-da-ki
beat-1S-DECThe adverbial in (2651) has a negative instrumental sense, and cannot be interpreted as an argument in the form of a relative clause, like ‘I hit him who was
without a hammer’.
Although the origin of the root of the apparent adverb dako'ro ‘left’ is unclear, its extension -koro ‘arm’ is otherwise a productive classifier. The proper
use of this adverb is not well documented, but the following example shows
that it cannot function as an adjective, though other nouns normally do:
(2652)*dako'ro
left
‘left eye’e'cǊi
eyeOther adverbs ending in classifiers are based on nominal roots but they
contain directionals such as -rja- ‘rim’ (see 5.3.3.) in the following examples:6.2. Adverbial morphology(2653)mãreri'tsa a'wͿi-da-hͿ-ki

hide-DEC503ywynwͿ-rja-'nwͿ
tree-DC:rim-CL:treeIf these nouns would not function as adverbs, but as locative arguments of the
verb, they would have been marked with locative case. These adverbs do not
differ structurally from those discussed in (6.2.1.), which are based on the
empty adverbial root a- and which contain directionals and which end in a classifier, such as e.g. (2625).
Demonstratives and question roots ending in the classifier -rjͿ ‘area’ are
considered as nouns in the present analysis.282 Although they often function as
locative objects, they do not usually bear the corresponding locative or instrumental case marker. Hence, their use can be considered as adverbial:

not allow the locative case either.

Zezinho-POS-CD:area(-LOC) many-NOM exist-DECchicken
‘there are many chickens at Zezinho’s’Nevertheless, similar instances were attested in (4.6.3.) where the locative case
marker was allowed.
Also demonstratives ending in -(xu)ko may function as adverbs (see the examples in 4.6.3.).
Because independent stems of whatever categorial status can be easily zeroverbalised, it is not entirely certain whether the adverbs discussed in the following are originally verb roots or whether their possible use as verb roots is
the result of productive verbalisation. The root of the verb habui-ki ‘it is outside of the house’ is used as an adverb in the following example:
282.The hypothesis that these words are nouns is corroborated by many data presented in
section (4.6.) on demonstratives and section (4.2.) on classifiers.","[534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"
"7.1. Negation523Probably, the interpretation of negative+person order reversal is dependent
on relations of scope:

‘I did not see only him (I saw the other one too)’295In (2776) the subject did see the object Alberto, but not exclusively him. Apparently then, the negative morpheme corrects a presupposition which is present in the context of speech. In this case the presupposition to be corrected is
represented by the morpheme -le ‘only’. In the following example -he- seems
to negate -rata:
(2777)xyi-ra'ta
a'wͿi-xa-hͿ-he-ki
you-first
see-2-NOM-NEG-DEC
‘you didn’t see it first (I did)’296
(lit. ‘it isn’t so that you were the first one to see it’)Also in (2777), the subject did see the object, but he was not the first one to do
so. In the ensuing examples person-negative morpheme order may also be connected with the counter of presuppositions:

‘what good would it be?, he couldn’t stay together with me’ (t)295.The full expression in Kwaza for ‘I did not only see Alberto, but the other one too’
does not involve a negative, but a positive extra medial clause.
296.There is no unambiguous way to express: ‘you saw it last’.
297.On one occasion, the consultant MA said that this sentence consists of three words:
si nãi daheki. This could be an indication that Kwaza is morphologically less complex than I presume. On the other hand, he said elsewhere that words can occur unfinished, and do require to be completed.","[560, 561]"
"Types of morphemesIn this section, a schematic overview is given of different types of parts of
words, i.e. morphemes, and how they relate to specific parts of speech. There
are two basic morpheme types: free morphemes and bound morphemes. The
free morphemes can be further divided in monomorphemic stems, which may
represent either nouns, adverbs or particles, and morphologically complex
stems, which can represent any independent word, including inflected verbs.
3.2.1. Bound morphemes
There are three types of bound morphemes in Kwaza: roots, suffixes and prefixes. The roots have usually a lexical semantic content, whereas the affixes
tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. From a semantic perspective,
the distinction is not absolute, since there are also affixes with a highly lexical
content, which is in contrast to certain semantically rather empty roots.
Roots can be subdivided further. The canonical verbal roots constitute one
of the two big open word classes. The bound roots represent a specific type that
consists of three closed classes of specific verb roots which require further
derivation by a nominaliser, a classifier or an attributive morpheme. Only
thereafter may they (non-obligatorily) receive person and mood inflexions.
This type includes genuine numeral roots, demonstrative roots and a number of
roots which have an “adjectival” semantic content. A third type is represented
by the two dummy roots nãi- ‘to be like’ and jã- ‘to be’, which have auxiliary
functions in the sentence and which also occur in many expressions. The final
type is represented by the noun formative empty root e- and the adverb formative empty root a-.
Suffixes can be further subdivided into inflexional and derivational suffixes.
Although there is no sharp boundary between these categories, one can roughly
say that derivational suffixes are facultative and their application modifies the
meaning and/or the category of the word, whereas inflexional suffixes are in
principle obligatory and do not modify the word’s meaning but indicate the
syntactic function of sentence constituents. In the present work the inflexional
suffixes are considered not to have category changing properties, because when
attached to noun roots, they form inflected nouns, and when attached to verb
roots they form inflected verbs. However, noun roots may receive verb inflexions and then function as verb roots without any other grammatical marking. I
considered this as zero-verbalisation, i.e.: verbalisation is the default value of
category change in absence of a specific verbalising morpheme. This approach
is possible, because change into one of the the other categories is always accompanied by specific nominalising or adverbialising morphemes.
The demonstrative proximal and distal prefixes are the only proper prefixes
in Kwaza. Apart from these, certain concomitants of compounded roots may
behave as either prefixes or suffixes.",[134]
"5.6. Nominalisation(2448)471ace'rjͿ-ki onİ-'nã-tsy-nãi
close-DEC arrive-FUT-GER-NOM
‘his arrival is close’, ‘he is going to arrive soon’Unlike other nouns, nouns formed by the morpheme -nãi cannot be possessed:
(2449)*si-dy-hͿ kwİ-da-nãi
I-POS-NOM inside-1S-NOM
‘my entering’Besides a nominalising function, -nãi may also have adverbialising functions. Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether a verb in -nãi is used nominally or adverbially:
(2450)hyriko'ro
tu'rwe-tse ku'kuihͿ-nãi
ill-NOM
monkey
heal-DEC
‘the monkey got better from a disease’In the present analysis, adverbs formed by -nãi are regarded as nouns from the
point of view of morphological analysis, but as adverbs from a semantic point
of view. They are discussed extensively in section (6.2.4.2.).
5.6.3. The first person plural cross-reference morpheme -aAs demonstrated in the previous sections, verbs which are nominalised by -hͿ
or -nãi retain person marking. This person marking may be expressed by overt
cross-reference morphemes or, in case of a third person, by zero-marking.
Cross-reference markers occur in nominalised verbs without any change of
meaning, except for the first person plural. When applied before nominalisation
by -hͿ, -nãi and, possibly, -hͿwã (see 5.6.4.below), the first person plural
marker -a- may get a non-personal sense. Under its occurrence in such instances, the verb is interpreted as if it is not inflected for person at all, be it
overt or covert. In a way, the first person plural marker enables the creation of
an abstract noun.
When -a- is applied before the nominaliser -hͿ, the result is often something
that resembles an infinitive-like action noun:
(2451)tsu'tsu-hͿ

‘the one that urinates’(2452)tsu'tsu-a-hͿ

chicha-CAU-1P-NOM
‘about making chicha’ (t)The result of nominalisation with -a- may also resemble an agent noun. Two
possible translations were offered for the word mƭudy?ahͿ in the above example: ‘in order to make chicha’ and (although considered less appropriate)5.6. Nominalisation473‘maker of chicha’. This semantic ambiguity can be explained better with the
following example:
(2463)'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-hͿ
board
house-CAU-1P-NOM
‘boards to build a house’266According to the consultant the word axydy?ahͿ can be translated both as ‘in
order to make a house’ and as ‘maker of a house’. This is apparently because of
the fact that the involved boards both serve the builder to make a house and
constitute the house themselves.267 The next example represents an instrument
noun:
(2464)'a-a-hͿ
exist-1P-NOM
‘(once-) inhabited place / house’In the translations offered by the consultants of the nominalisations discussed here, -a- seems to behave as sort of infinitive marker meaning something like ‘(thing) with reference to V-ing’. Literally, however, all occurrences
of -a- can and should be regarded as first person plural cross-reference. In some
of the following examples, I have added a literal translation. The result of -a-hͿ
can be zero-verbalised:
(2465)ou-'dy-a-hͿ-ki
catch-CAU-1P-NOM-DEC
‘it’s to hook up (i.e. a clip)’ (lit. ‘it’s a thing which we hook up with’)(2466)to'mã=jã-hͿ-le-ki

bathe-1P-NOM-FRUST-DEC
bathe=be-NOM-FRUST-DEC
‘it was for bathing (but now it has broke down)’268
(lit. ‘it was a thing by which we bathed’)The nominaliser -hͿ is also a classifier. The next example shows that it can
be replaced by more specific classifiers also when it is preceded by nonpersonal -a-:266.The order 21 is also allowed.
267.Germanic and Romance languages have words that have the form of an agent noun,
even though they refer to patient, instrument or locative nouns, e.g. English drawer
‘box which can be drawn out of a piece of furniture by its handle’, Dutch hanger
‘thing which is instrumental in hanging up clothes’, and Spanish comedor ‘dining
room’.
268.This is an answer to the question ‘what is this pipe for?’.","[508, 509, 510, 511]"
"2064. The noun phraseThe following examples are from ME who remembered words from Kanoê, a
language that she has not spoken since her early childhood:

(826) cİ̘'rƭ-wa-hͿ-'lİ
İpy'kwa ta-wa-ki
peanut-IS-NOM-only İpy'kwa talk-IS-DEC
‘‘peanut’ they call İpy'kwa’
The Kwaza words that are translated in these three examples are apparently
embedded in a quotative construction through zero-verbalisation (see also
4.4.9.).
It is possible that -le morpheme is related to the frustrative morpheme discussed in (8.2.2.2.) and (5.5.18.). Because of the recursive faculty of nominalisation and verbalisation in Kwaza, -le can occur deep inside a verb:
(827) haje-nͿ-'nãi-le-'ra
(828) ƭ
kui-tsy-nãi-'le-xa-ki
idly drink-GER-NOM-only-2-DEC
smear-REF-NOM-only-IMP
‘only/just put medicine on it!’ (t) ‘you’re just drinking, doing nothing’
4.4.6. Additive use of repetitive -e
The verbal repetitive aspect morpheme -(je)?e- ‘again’ discussed in (5.5.31.)
can also be attached to a noun. It is applied word-finally as -e, and the result is
a noun with the added meaning ‘too, also’:
(829) si-'e huru'ja-da-ki
I-too like-1S-DEC
‘I too want coffee’ka'wİ

(833) ale-'e
'tana o'ri-tja
axe-too well climb-CSO
‘with his axe he climbed up’ (t)
In some words the additive morpheme is probably lexicalised:
(834) ã'rǊi=eke-'e
tapir=horn-too
‘cow’(835) 'kanwã=ekai-'e
canoe=leg-too
‘motorcar’4.4.7. Prioritive -rata
The morpheme -rata ‘first’ is applied to nouns and produces nouns in the following manner:
(836) si-ra'ta 'dai-da-ki
I-first
take-1S-DEC
‘I took first’(837) dilİ-ra'ta
'dai-xa-re

lightning-GER-NOM-first ahead-REF-DEC
‘the flash comes first (then the thunder)’
4.4.8. Intensifying -te(te)
The reduplicated form of the adverbial intensifier -te is applied not only to verb
roots (see 5.5.30.) and adverbs (see 6.2.4.4.), but also to nouns, without an adverbial sense:
(840) kanwa-te'te
canoe-INTENS
‘real canoe’(841) lato-wy-te'te
yesterday-time-INTENS
‘day before day before yesterday’(842) ti-rjͿ-te'te-xa-hͿ-re
what-CD:area-INTENS-2-NOM-INT
‘where exactly did you (say it was)?’2084. The noun phrase4.4.9. Zero-verbalisation
Kwaza verbs are always morphologically complex: in order for a verb to occur
as an independent word, the root must be inflected for person and mood. Elliptic structures (see 7.5.) are of course an exception to this. However, elliptic or
not, verbs can be nominalised only through overt morphemes, such as -hͿ and
-nãi. Nouns, on the other hand, are not necessarily morphologically complex.
Noun roots can occur as such as independent words. Nouns are not verbalised
by specific verbalising morphemes. For nouns to be verbalised, they are treated
simply as verb roots. The affixation of a mood morpheme suffices, and no special morphology needs to intervene between the noun root and the verbal morphemes. Therefore, I consider all application of verbal morphology to nouns to
be the result of zero-verbalisation at some stage.
Zero-verbalisation is very common, and it has several functions. Kwaza
does not have a copular verb which corresponds to English ‘to be’. In order to
express this function the noun is turned into a predicate through the application
of mood markers. This is done with the noun etay ‘woman’ in the following
examples:
(843) e'tay-ki
woman-DEC
‘it is a woman’(844) 'joni e'tay-ki
Ione woman-DEC
‘Ione is a woman’Predicative use of nouns may also express the notion of ‘want to have’ or
‘to be in want of’.125 In the third person singular declarative ambiguity is
avoided through the alternative declarative mood markers -ki and quotatively
used -tse. Compare the following example with (844) above:
(845) ipİ'pa e'tay-tse
Ipepa
woman-DEC
‘Ipepa wants a woman’126
One may also compare the following examples to one another:
(846) ka'wİ-ki
coffee-DEC
‘it is coffee’vs.ka'we-tse
coffee-DEC
‘he wants/asks for coffee’125.According to Vasconcelos (1996) this construction also exists in Aikanã.
126.This implies usually that Ipepa, an Aikanã male, wants to have sex with a woman. In
order to leave no doubt about this, the following was spontaneously proposed by the
consultant as a less veiled alternative: ipİ'pa i'txitse ‘Ipepa wants pussy’. Note that
ipİ'pa e'tayki would mean: ‘Ipepa is a woman’.","[243, 244, 245, 246]"
"1304. The noun phrase4.2.1.2. Classification of derived attributive verb stems
In other constructions than the ones shown above, -hͿ may function as a Neutral classifier. In that position, it can be substituted by any other classifier, e.g.
-mǊ ‘liquid’, depending on the grammatical context. In the following examples,
the attributive (4.3.2.1.) morpheme -Ϳ- has to be added to the verb stem before
a classifier may occur:
(265) ho'ho-Ϳ-hͿ
black-ATT-NOM
‘(a) black (one)’(266) ho'ho-Ϳ-mǊ
black-ATT-CL:liquid
‘black liquid’(267) ho'ho-Ϳ-nǊ
black-ATT-CL:powder
‘gunpowder’(268) ho'ho-Ϳ-siki
black-ATT-CL:skin
‘black clothes’4.2.1.3. Classification of derived noun stems: possessive
Due to the properties of attributive constructions in Kwaza, nouns can be juxtaposed to a referent and act as a modifier (see 4.3.2.). The concomitant nouns
may be bare nouns or not, and the modifier may be an argument of the verbal
stem of a nominalised referent or not. In the following example, wade'xyi
‘straw’ can be considered as an argument of the verb bu- ‘to put’:
(269) wade-'xyibu-ni'te
tucuma-CL:hair put-INSTR
‘straw hat’
(lit. ‘thing of straw of tucuma to (be) put (on the head)’)
The Kwaza possessive construction consists of a noun extended with the
morpheme -dy- (homophonous with verbal causative/benefactive) and a final
classifier (see 4.3.1.). The result can either function as an independent nominal
expression, as in example (270) below, or attributively as a modifier to a referent head noun, as in (271) and (274). Sometimes a choice is possible between a
Neutral or a more specific classifier. When the specific classifier is etymologically related to the referent it classifies, the referent may be omitted, as in (272)
and (275), as if the classifier were a cross-reference morpheme (note that word
order difference probably does not have influence here):
(270) 'si-dy-hͿ
I-POS-NOM
‘mine / my one’(271) 'si-dy-hͿ a'xy
I-POS-NOM house
‘my house’4.2. Class131(272) (a'xy)

Tavivi-POS-NOM
‘Tavivi’s house’(275) tawi'wi-dy-xy
Tavivi-POS-CL:house
‘Tavivi’s house’a'xy
houseNote that the possessive element -dy- is absent or optional under circumstances described in (4.3.1.) and (4.2.1.9.).
4.2.1.4. Classification of bare attributive roots
Kwaza has a small group of bound roots which are always followed by a classifier. They have often an adjectival meaning, such as “new”, “cold” etc. Numerals also belong to this group, which is further discussed in (4.3.2.2.). These
roots cannot occur as bare independent words, since they must be minimally
derived as nouns through the application of classifiers. Neither can they be
used as verb stems without intervening classifiers.
(276) arwa-'hͿ

‘new one’(*arwa-ki)(277) a'xy arwa-'hͿ
house new-NOM

awy-mǊ-'dy-da-ki
cold-CL:liquid-CAU-1S-DEC
grow-CL:woman-1S-CSO
‘being an old woman I find the water cold’1324. The noun phraseNot all verb roots which display this characteristic of boundness are semantically attributive, such as ãrǊ- ‘to rub’, which furthermore never occurs without
verbal inflexion (see the last examples of 5.6.1.).
4.2.1.5. Classification of adverbial stems
There is a group of directional affixes (see 5.3.) which frequently form free
(positional) adverbs when applied to the semantically empty adverbial root a(see 6.2.1.). They can be derived further by classifiers and become nouns:
(286) a-toto-'mǊ
Ø-DR:upward-CL:liquid
‘riverside’
The adverbial stem in the following example does contain a lexicalised directional, -ritsa- ‘outside’ (see also 6.2.1.), but not the empty root a-:
(287) tsiritsa-'mǊ
middle-CL:liquid
‘the middle of the river’
Classified adverbs may also remain functionally adverbial (see 6.2.). As adverbs, the result indicates the position with regard to the item to which the classifier refers:
(288) a-toto-'xy
Ø-DR:upward-CL:house
‘on top of the house’
4.2.1.6. Classification of demonstrative roots
The classifier -hͿ as well as the other classifiers can be applied to a demonstrative root, e.g.:
(289) Ϳ-'hͿ
Ϳ-'ro
Ϳ-'rjͿ‘this one’
‘this cup’
‘over here, this place’ay-'hͿ
ay-'tay
ay-'rjͿ‘that one’
‘that woman’
‘over there, that place’ (t)Demonstratives may be juxtaposed to nouns and form an attributive construction:4.2. Class133(290) ay-'rjͿ
o'ja-tsy-rjͿ
leave-GER-CD:area
that-CD:area
‘that place where he would go to’
Also here, specific classifiers allow the omission of the head of the attributive
construction:
(291) (ywy'nwͿ) jã-Ϳ-'nwͿ
DIST-this-CL:tree
tree
‘the tree (over) there’
4.2.1.7. Classification of interrogative roots
Kwaza has bound interrogative roots which are always followed by a classifier.
In this respect, they resemble attributive, numeral and adverbial roots. Compare
the following examples:
(292) ti-'hͿ
(293) ti-'wy
(294) ti-'tay
what-time
what-CL:woman
what-NOM
‘which one?, where?’
‘when?, what time?’
‘which woman?’
4.2.1.8. Classifier incorporation
The most common occurrence of classifiers is as an “incorporated” element
within verb stems. In this context they represent a trace of an argument of the
verb, and may not nominalise the verb. The root of the verb can also be used as
a verb stem by itself, but usually with a slightly different meaning. The involved semantic change is idiomatic. Compare e.g. wai-ki ‘it is (or tastes)
good’ and nͿ-ki ‘he is fat’ to the following examples:
(295) wai-'hͿ-ki
good-NOM-DEC
‘it is beautiful’(296) wai-'xy-ki
good-CL:house-DEC
‘it is a beautiful house’ (not: ‘a good house’)(297) nͿ-'hͿ-ki
fat-NOM-DEC
‘he is big’(298) koreja'ro
nͿ-'ro-ki
pan
fat-CL:cup-DEC
‘the pan is big’ (not: ‘the pan is fat’)One indication that classifiers do not necessarily nominalise verb stems, but
that they can also be incorporated without changing the category, is the possible attachment of the instrument nominaliser -nite. This nominaliser is never
attached to a noun, and it is only found attached to a classifier if this classifier
is preceded by a verbal stem:1344. The noun phrase(299) de're Ǌ-nã'si-ni'tİ
shell be-CL:ear-INSTR
‘earring’ (lit. ‘shell for being put into the ear’)
The verb root awͿi- usually means ‘to see’ but sometimes also ‘to watch’. The
verb root awãta- ‘to watch (it)’ is probably derived from a combination of
awͿi- and the transitiviser -ta-. This combination is lexicalised because it has to
be succeeded by a directional or a classifier, unlike other verbs marked with
-ta-.
(300) awãta-'hͿ-da-ki
(301) awãta-'xy-da-ki
see-CL:leaf-1S-DEC
see-NOM-1S-DEC
‘I’m looking at him’, ‘I’m watching’
‘I’m looking at the paper’
Multiple classifiers can be “incorporated” into the verb and cross-refer to its
arguments. The verb hay- ‘to cut’ is normally limited to the cutting of wood,
but it may form a relatively fixed combination with certain classifiers:
(302) hay-xy-nǊ-ko'ro-da-mͿ
cut-CL:hair-CL:powder-Cl:arm-1S-VOL
‘I’m going to cut hair off the arm’
In this example, the classifier -xy- refers to the hair that is being cut off, and
-koro- to the arm of which it is cut off. The classifier -nǊ- is probably not an
“incorporated” argument, but it further specifies hair as a powder-like substance and may as such specify the manner of hair-cutting.
4.2.1.9. Classifiers attached to nouns
Classifiers may be attached to nouns, and can act as second members in compounds. The result is a noun either with a related, or with a rather different
meaning, e.g.:
(303) uruhu-'ro
vulture-CL:cup
‘headdress of vulture feathers’(304) haki-'xy
stone-CL:house
‘house made of stone’(305) atxitxi-'to
maize-kernel
‘kernel of maize’(306) atxitxi.'?Ǌ
maize .grain
‘rice’(307) jo-'mǊ
manioc-CL:liquid
‘manioc beer’(308) kawe-'nǊ
coffee-CL:powder
‘ground coffee’4.2. Class135Some possessive expressions may also be turned in to noun-classifying constructions, but this is not very productive either:
(309) o'lu(-dy)-ku'ty
curassow-POS-CL:head
‘head of curassow’
In the following example, the classifier does not change anything but seems to
be there only to further describe the meaning of the stem.
(310) koreja-ka'nİ
knife-CL:oblong.object
‘(wooden) machete’(311) ka'wİ
coffee
‘coffee’(312) kawİ-'mǊ
coffee-CL:liquid
‘coffee’A similar construction, in which a Portuguese noun is combined with a Kwaza
classifier, is found in 'tauBa-kanİ ‘washing-up platform’ (lit. ‘boardCL:oblong’ or ‘board-CL:board’).
4.2.1.10. Lexicalised classifiers
With several nouns, especially names of plant species, a classifier is combined
with a noun root. The noun root and the classifier cannot occur as independent
words. Although such words cannot be analysed (any more?) semantically, the
classifier may remain formally identical to its productive equivalent e.g.:
(313) kuri.'xyi
quiet?.hair
‘penis flag’ (fibre penis gourd for virgin boys)

‘yesterday I was worried about Piu because he had a fever too and
pain in the head and he was nauseous.’ (t)
The etymology of -xote- is unsolved. Maybe it consists of the element -xwa-,
which can be interpreted as the classifier -xwa- ‘human’, or as the element
-xwa-, which occurs in a number of transitive cross-referemce markers. The
element -tİ- might then be related to intensifier -tİ- or nominaliser -te-. Maybe
the same element is found in the verb roots oxote- ‘to stalk (on something or
someone)’ and txixotİ- ‘come to the rescue (of someone)’.
On a few occasions a reflexive alternative of transitive -xote- was documented which partially supports the segmentability sketched above,
-nͿ-dwate-:
(1758)ka?awani'hͿ-nͿ-dwatİ-ta

‘I’m thinking/worrying about myself’5.4. Valency and valency change365The reflexive morpheme -nͿ- is readily recognisable in this morpheme, and
possibly the element -dwa-, which may be related to the indefinite different
subject (see 8.3.2.2.). The entire combination may have an emphatic effect:
(1760)emã-nͿ-dwa'tİ-tse

cry-REF-TRA-DEC
‘(the children are) crying a lot’xy'xy-nͿ-dwa'tİ-da-ki
scream-REF-TRA-1S-DEC
‘I screamed a lot’225Apparently, -dwate- cannot be applied to other verbs that have nothing to do
with one’s emotional state (the consultant said: “one’s life”). In that case, the
intensifying element -tete must be used. The element -dwate- was also encountered with the intransitive verb xyxy- ‘scream of pain or fear’:
(1762)ãrǊi-'wã xyxy-dwa'te-da-ki
tapir-AO scream-TRA-1S-DEC
‘I screamed at the cow’ (it was about to stand on my/someone’s foot)This is the only non-reflexive verb stem with which -dwate- was attested. The
resulting verb means ‘to scream at someone in order to stave off imminent
danger for oneself or someone else’.
There is one alternative for this construction, in which -dwate- is replaced
by yet another transitiviser, -xete- (pronounced as [³ete]):
(1763)ãrǊi-'wã xyxy-xe'te-da-ki
tapir-AO scream-TRA-1S-DEC
‘I screamed at the cow’ (CX: it was about to stand on my or someone
else’s foot, e.g. while milking it)Also -xete- was encountered with just the root xyxy- ‘scream’. The meaning of
(1763) was claimed to be identical to (1762), be it that (1763) was claimed to
be less felicitous. The element -xete- seems to go better with plural subjects:

‘they (people) screamed to thwart danger’226(1765)xyxy-xe'te-ki

long chains of clauses in the cosubordinative mood. These cosubordinated

‘why is he putting on shoes?’661The exact semantics of the medial clause is not perfectly clear. In some examples it was translated by the consultant as a clefted sentence, in which analysis
its subject would obviously not be identical to the matrix clause subject:

‘he writes in order to learn’However, such clefted translations were sometimes also given for medial verbs
which were overtly marked for person, such as in (3483).
Although the fused morpheme -tja is often encountered as the third person
cosubordinative marker, transparent, i.e. zero-marking is also attested. In this
construction the canonical cosubordinative marker -ta is used and the third person subject gets canonical zero expression. No semantic or pragmatic distinctions whatsoever were encountered between these alternative expressions, and
all consultants always said “it means the same”. The following examples were
considered as totally equivalent:

‘he entered and ate maize porridge’The only systematic difference between the two alternatives seems to lie in
their relative frequency of occurrence: third person -Ø-ta is rarer than -tja. The
following examples do not reveal any specific systematic differences with
those containing -tja which we saw earlier on:6628. Subordination and coordination(3502)wywy'rjͿ-ki

the verb root (see 5.5.27.).
No convincing morphophonological circumstances were observed to require
one or the other expression of the third person cosubordinative. The only formal condition which was encountered seems to consist in either formal resemblance (analogy) or etymological relationship of a preceding syllable to a person cross-reference marker. After the verb root tsicwa- ‘begin’, the cosubordinative morpheme -tja is not possible. This is probably because the element
-cwa- is associated with indefinite subject -cwa-, which is discussed in
(8.3.1.5.). Nevertheless In the following example, the element -cwa- is an indefeasible part of the verb root:

ki ‘DEC’. The declarative mood marker -ki is the form normally encountered in
(elicited) declarative sentences. It is fully productive with all subject and object
persons. The zero-marked third person form is usually the citation (translation)
form of an isolated verb.
(1258)'mã-Ø-ki
call-3-DEC
‘he/she/it/they call/called’In elicited complex sentences, declarative cosubordinated verb phrases are in
the cosubordinative “mood” (see 8.3.), whereas the last word of the sentence is
usually the matrix verb ending in declarative -ki:
(1259)'e-wa-ta
'hu-wa-ki
leave-IS-CSO smoke-IS-DEC
‘(she) went (home and is) smoking’In running text the declarative is rare. It is often used for directly quoted passages within a narrative:

nothing-CSO

Curiangu ill-1S-DEC
‘another (man called) Curiangu said “I’m ill” but it was a lie’ (t)In running text most “sentences”, including the declarative, are normally in the
cosubordinative mood. Such texts, usually traditional tales, are often finished
by a verbal formula with a declarative mood ending -ki, as if the whole preceding text was one long complex sentence, symbolically ending with a matrix
verb form:5.2. Mood(1261)duky'hͿ ehͿ-'si

When eliciting the second person forms in the declarative, usually a context
of joking or irony had to be offered. It was never easy to avoid being given the
pragmatically more usual imperative or interrogative forms.
tse ‘DEC’. There is an alternative declarative ending -tse, which is often pronounced as [tsİ]. It is hard to determine what the fundamental difference is
between the declarative in -tse and the declarative in -ki. Sometimes they behave as if they are mutually interchangeable:
(1262)'wy-ki
/ 'wy-tse
(1263)
wind-DEC
wind-DEC
‘(leaves) are rustling (in the wind)’'kwİ-ki
/
enter-DEC
‘he entered’'kwİ-tse
enter-DECVerbs in the -tse declarative are basically equivalent to those in the declarative
in -ki. They are matrix verbs which can take cosubordinate clauses in the cosubordinative mood:
(1264)mangka-'to
hoi-'tja
tãi-'he-tse
mango-CL:fruit sweet-CSO tough-NEG-DEC
‘the mangoes are sweet and soft’5.2.1.1. Distributional characteristics of -tse vs. -ki
There are some important morphologically determined systematic differences
in the distribution of -ki and -tse. -ki may occur with all persons and without
any further adaptation of the verb root. -tse can only occur with the zeromarked third person subject (and object), and cannot be combined with an immediately preceding overt person marker:
(1265)'kwİ-da-ki (*'kwİdatse)
enter-1S-DEC
‘I entered’(1266)'kwİ-wa-ki (*'kwİwatse)
enter-IS-DEC
‘someone entered’2865. The verb phraseWhen following overt person markers, including indefinite and impersonal,
other morphemes have to intervene between -tse and the person marker. In the
following example, the potential aspect marker -tsy- occurs between the person
and mood markers:
(1267)'kwİ-da-tsy-tsİ
(*'kwİdatsyki)
enter-1S-POT-DEC
‘I will enter’So -tse can be combined with overt person markers inside one verb, but it is in
principle never adjacent to them.173
A related morphological condition on the distribution of the declarative
markers is found in the fact that certain morphemes such as the said -tsy- ‘(potential)’, -tara- ‘(procrastinative)’ and -'nã- ‘(future)’ disallow the occurrence
of an immediately subsequent -ki, and require -tse (and see also 5.2.1.5.):
(1268)ja-da-ta'ra-tsİ
(*jadata'raki)
eat-1S-PROC-DEC
‘I’ll eat later’In contrast, there are also derivational morphemes which never precede -tse,
even when there is no overt person marker, such as the attributive -Ϳ-:
(1269)hare'tİ-Ϳ-ki
(*haretİ?Ϳtse)
bald-ATT-DEC
‘he is bald’When overt person marking intervenes between a derivational morpheme
and the declarative, the -ki declarative is required. Note, for example, that future -nã-, which only combines with the -tse declarative, is homophonous with
the impersonal cross-reference marker -nã- ‘one’. The consultant once suggested that in order to preserve the distinction between these morphemes different declarative markers are required:
(1270)kui-'nã-tse
(*kui'nãki)
drink-FUT-DEC
‘he is going to drink’(1272)kui-'nã-da-ki (*kui'nãdatse)
drink-FUT-1S-DEC
‘I am going to drink’(1271)'kui-nã-ki (*'kuinãtse)
drink-one-DEC
‘we are drinking/one drank’173.The only cross-reference morpheme that does seem to be allowed in a position immediately adjacent to -tse is the indefinite object morpheme -ja-. This was attested
twice, in examples (1177) and (1198) in (5.1.4.2-3.).","[321, 322, 323, 324]"
"8.4. Nominal clauses703Example (3706) has three different possible translations.408 The first one seems
the most likely equivalent of the Kwaza sentence, even though the subject wã
‘bee’ is not a possessor. The implicit head can neither be ‘bee’, nor ‘sting’
(Kwaza does not even have a noun with that meaning). Translation (3706a)
suggests that it represents an inherently headless attributive clause that bears
similarity to (3649). The second translation is based on the analysis of the
nominal clause as a complement clause in the sense of section (8.4.2.). The
third translation represents what seems to be the least likely analysis. It suggests that the implicit head of the attributive clause is a locative satellite: ‘the
place’, as it is possibly the case in (3638).
Of course, translations never constitute decisive evidence in themselves for
the analysis of structures in another language. The consultant commented that
bu'hͿ and bu'nãi meant exactly the same and he even translated one example of
the latter as attributive-like, rather than as complement-like:
(3707)kane'xu bu-'nãi
a'wͿi-da-ki
necklace wear-NOM see-1S-DEC
‘I saw (one) with a necklace’409Meanwhile, he also translated nominal clauses ending in -hͿ sometimes as
complement clauses. What makes translations in this context even more independable is the fact that in Portuguese the word que functions both as a relative
pronoun ‘which, who’ and as a complementiser ‘that’.
It must be emphasised that the consultant translated most examples in a way
which corresponds systematically with the analysis presented here in (8.4.).
Compare the next example to examples (3652) and (3653):
(3708)kahİ-'hͿ
a'wͿi-da-ki etohoi-'wã (jere'xwa)
jaguar
bite-NOM see-1S-DEC child-AO
‘I saw that (the dog) bit the child’410This example differs from (3652) in that the embedded verb does not contain
the gerundial morpheme -tsy-, whereas it is similar to the extent that it does
have an object marked by -wã. The situation is reversed with respect to (3653).
Here, (3708) differs in that it has an object marked by -wã, whereas it is similar
where the morphology of the embedded verb is concerned. The fact that the
nominal clause in (3708) ends in -hͿ suggests that we are dealing with an attributive clause. However, the presence of -wã on the embedded object suggests that this object is not the head. And the absence of -tsy- suggests when
compared to (3653) that the subject is not the head either. The translation given

"72. (L:05: zarone), /tsİni/ [tsa(4)ni] ‘nose’, /-karwanƭ-/ ‘nostril (CL)’.
73. Notice also the fact that /Ǌ/ was pronounced fronted as [i] in this word, which was
also found in Zack (1943) (Z:116: bitadê). In family I, the pronunciation is [Ǌta'ÈÓ].
74. (Z:108±: aruín)802. The sounds of KwazaAs regards age-determined variation, it may be the case that certain
“marked” sounds of Kwaza which are not found in surrounding languages are
also relatively difficult to acquire for children. Kwaza adults claim that [³] instead of [s] for /x/ is characteristic for children’s speech, although the adults
themselves have also been attested to use the [³] pronunciation, however seldom. The same goes for [ts] instead of [s], which is often found in children’s
speech, where it is considered as simplified: /exyitaki/ [e'sÓKtaki] ~ [e'tsitaki]
‘(wasp) stung me’.
2.14. Phoneme fluctuation
There are several phonemes between which there is optional fluctuation. This
concerns usually only certain specific words and the occurrence of neither phoneme is predictable on the basis of (morpho)phonological rules. This also implies that it is sometimes difficult to establish which phoneme is basic. Extensive phoneme fluctuation is attested in various other South American languages, e.g. in Bolivian Chama (Tacana) (Key 1968, 1979:86-87), and in Latundê (Nambikwara) (Telles 2002a:90). In relation to the fluctuation phenomena described here, no differences in pragmatic meaning or stylistic connotation were attested.
/a/ and /o/: In some cases free variation [a ~ Į ~ n] seems to be possible before
[u]: [autn'4İ] ~ [nutn'4İ] ‘bird’. In these cases, the difference between the phonemes /a/ and /o/ is neutralised in the initial position of this word and both pronunciations are allowed.
/e/ and /İ/: The phonetic ranges of both /e/ and /İ/ overlap. In order to establish
the phonemic status of the sounds [e] and [İ] in each particular instance it was
necessary to check both possibilities with the consultants. It appeared that /İ/,
rather than /e/, was the odd one out because of its relatively low frequency of
occurrence. The phoneme /e/ is often pronounced [İ] in rapid speech, whereas
/İ/ is hardly ever pronounced as [e].75 For instance, /weki/ ‘he fears’ can either
be pronounced as ['Yeki] or as ['Yİki]; only in an explicit contrast with /wİki/
‘he brought’, the /e/ of /weki/ is obligatorily realised as [e]. Notice furthermore
/eni/ ‘egg’: [e'nƭ] ~ [İ'nƭ]. The overlap between /e/ and /İ/ can be represented as
follows:
/e/
/İ/[e]
[æ]~
~[İ]
[İ]75. There is only one example of /İ/ being pronounced as [e]: /İtİrwİdaki/ ‘I’m rounding them (the cattle) up’ was once attested as [ete'4wİÈaki].","[117, 118]"
"5.5. Tense, modality and aspect(2269)atsile-'he-tjara-re
(*'atsiletjara're)
heavy-NEG-PROC-INT
‘it isn’t very heavy is it?’(2270)dehe-'he-tjara-re
bitter-NEG-PROC-INT
‘it isn’t very bitter, is it?’443In a way -tjara- in the latter two examples can also be interpreted as semantically related to ‘fortunately’. It so happens both questions anticipate a reassuring answer. Example (2269) was uttered in the context of someone wanting the
speaker to carry something, but the speaker was in doubt, because the item to
be carried looked rather heavy. Example (2270) was uttered in the context of
someone wanting the speaker to drink medicine. Especially children abhor bitter tastes. Note that the said positive equivalents (2252) and (2253) also have a
modal connotation of ‘fortunately’. Here is one more, elliptic, example:
(2271)'he-tjara-ki
NEG-PROC-DEC
‘it isn’t dirty!’, ‘don’t worry!’, ‘nothing wrong!’, ‘doesn’t matter!’Instead of the expected -tara-, we find -tjara- in the examples of the present
section. This strongly reminds of the variation between cosubordinative -ta and
-tja as discussed in (8.3.1.4.). This is corroborated by the fact that -tjara- is incompatible with non-third person forms. Compare the following example to
(2268):
(2272)txa'nã kui-'he-da-tara-re
drink-NEG-1S-PROC-INT
we.IN
‘good that I did not drink (it)!’ (it was poisoned)So, one could ask whether -tara- is actually discontinuous. Would it not be
better to analyse it as a clause-final cosubordinative -ta, which is then followed
by an unidentified verb ra- of modal content? And, would this have consequences for the analysis of all examples in the present section (5.5.19.)? Under
such an analysis, e.g. (2214) should be analysed as a biclausal construction:
(2273)'ja-da-ta
'ra-tse
eat-1S-CSO ???-DEC
‘I’ll eat later’The fact that ra- bears stress here could be used in support of its interpretation
as a verbal root. However, there are very many instances of ra- without stress,
to begin with (2215). Furthermore, -tara- can be omitted, together with the
sense of ‘to do later’, as if it were an indivisible suffix:4445. The verb phrase(2274)o'kja-a-'xa-(tara)-tsy-hͿ-he're=jã-re
(see 8.1.1.3.)
hunt-1P-AS-PROC-POT-NOM-APPL=be-INT
‘we are still going to hunt! (but we’re too busy now)’Finally, no clearly identifiable verb root of the form ra- was attested. One
could assume the existence of such a root, by analysing ra- as ‘to be’ or ‘to become’. With some imagination, rahͿki in example (2256) can be ascribed the
sense of ‘to be certainly’, ratsytse in (2220) ‘to be potentially’, ramͿ in (2245)
‘I to be’ and so on. But then one would also expect elliptic occurrences of this
construction, in which a context like e.g. the question ‘when are you going to
eat?’ allows for a minimal answer, such as ratse ‘it will be’. However, such elliptic answers always include the preceding person marker and -ta-, as in
(2223).
There is actually one verb root of the form ra-. It is apparently based on the
imperative mood morpheme -ra. It occurs only in combination with a subsequent transitiviser -tja- and means ‘to order (him)’:
(2275)ra'tja-ki
(2276)
order-DEC
‘he ordered him’, ‘he’s insisting’İ-'nƭ-da-ta ra'tja-da-ki
go-CAUS-1S-CSO order-1S-DEC
‘I ordered him to go home’Another form based on imperative -ra is elliptic, and contains a preceding emphatic imperative morpheme -ca- (which is also pronounced as [tja]). It functions as a positive minimal answer to an offer or a declaration of intention:
(2277)ca-'ra
EMP-IMP
‘yes! / it is O.K. / do so!’I assume that these imperative constructions have nothing to do with any analysis of the procrastinative -t(j)ara-. They are discussed further in (5.5.11.1.).
5.5.19.4. Tentative conclusion
For the time being, I have considered -tara- and -tjara- as variants of the same
modal/aspectual suffix. It may be that both are fossilisations of formerly discontinuous elements in a fixed type of expression containing a modal verb.
In the following table I give an overview of the distributional and semantic
properties of -tara-, according to their order of occurrence in the discussions
above, with reference to primary examples.","[480, 481, 482]"

"2. Kwaza-English vocabulary
-nİ- (DR)
hither (while originating
from here)
This morpheme it not very productive
and has a very restricted distibution.
The goal of the movement it expresses
is always the place where the subject
of the verb in some way belongs, and
only the source of the movement can
occur as a locative satellite. ͅrjãwã'nã
o'nİki ‘he came / went out of the
forest’ (order also 2-1). kwİnİ'ra
‘enter!’ (S is inside), kwİ'ra ‘enter!’ (S
is outside). The concept of ‘hither, originating from there’ can be expressed
by a combination of -ja- ‘thither’ and
-nͿ- ‘reflexive’, as in oja'nͿ-.
nİҊi- (V) press, pinch
Also [nͅƭ]. Also ‘to milk a cow’.
'nİ̎idaki ‘I’m wringing out (clothes)’,
'jono'ni 'nİ̎ini'tİ ‘manioc press’.
-ni (CL) egg
E-noun. nͿ'niki ‘it is a big egg’,
kurakura'nƭ wady?eteja'nãtse sitsİ'wã /
txanã'wã ‘he is going to give us eggs’.
-ni (svv) EXH
Verbal exhortative mood ending of the
matrix clause. It occurs with first
person inclusive,
third
person
(zero-marked) and indefinite subjects.
awemǊ'ko haha'djohata'ni ‘let the rain
wash your foot!’, 'ja?atara'ni ‘let’s eat
first!’. When applied to a noun with
beneficiary case marking, it expresses
claiming or wanting: kanİ'xu 'sidu'ni ‘I
want a bracelet for me’, he'heku'tynͿ'nƭ
‘he should be covered’ (by someone,
but not by himself). It is probably
related to the causational / purposive
modal morpheme -nƭ-. There is a
special paucal exhortative -ja, an
exhortative particle hͿ'dİ and a hardly
productive negative exhortative -ini.
-nite (svn) INSTR
Sometimes also [nitİ]. Deverbal suffix
which creates an instrument, patient,
process or result noun. The element -te
probably originally represents the
nominalising part. hǊdwani'te ‘chair’,
hudadani'te
‘word’,
he'dynite905‘porridge, mixture’. Also used in
attributive constructions: auxwa'na
keni'te ‘fried meat’.
-nƭ- (svv) CAUS
*[ni]. Causational or purposive
modality. This modal morpheme has
probably developed from the exhortative mood marker -ni: 'mãdaki
one'nƭda'ta ‘I call her to come’, ja
kui'nƭdaki ‘I already let (him) drink’. It
may also have an accidental reflexive
sense: hadai'nͿdaki ‘I cut myself (on
purpose)’ vs. hadai'nƭdaki ‘I cut
myself (by accident)’.
-nƭ- (DR) into dust
Lexicalised DR/CL in roots such as
tsǊrǊrǊ'nƭ ‘sand’. More productive in:
kwİ'nƭki a'xydyda'mͿtja ‘he put (the
pole upright) into the ground to build a
house’.
-nƭ (CL) needle, thorn
Also [ni]. xyi'nƭ txinƭ'te ‘big needle’.
Probably also in tsurwani ‘nose’ and
olukeni ‘mutum beak’. ARI nƭ.
-nƭ- (DR) net, basket, bag
‘to put in a bag, net or basket’. tsãnƭ‘put seeds into basket’. Lexicalised in
arwenƭ- ‘carry chicha in a basket’.
-nƭnã- (svv) 2O
I/we-you: verbal first person subject,
second person object cross-reference
morpheme. Usually, the object is
singular. Canonical subject marking
remains obligatory. 'mİ̎nƭ'nãdaki ‘I am
beating you’.
nytesike (N) mat, flag
Traditional mat to sit on, braided out
of large palm leaf. MA also:
[nǊ'tesi'kje] ‘flag out of straw of bacuri
palm leaf, to symbolise party in
contest’. AIK nãe't³i.
nӻ- (V-stem) big
In the third person declarative only -ki
is used. It always requires a classifier,
nͿto'hoiki ‘it is a big child’, nͿ'kãixaki
‘you have a big mouth’, hakidwa
nͿ'dwaki ‘stone is big’, nͿ'hͿtxu'hǊitse
‘it is somewhat big’ (but not very big).
nͿhͿ'hͿki ‘it is bigger’ (comparative).","[942, 943]"
"DemonstrativesIn the present section the Kwaza demonstrative system is outlined. It appears to
be based primarily on orientation with respect to the speech participant. This is
demonstrated in (4.6.1.). Another distinction which is optionally made concerns distance with respect to speech participants and information in the discourse. This is discussed in (4.6.2.). Besides these general demonstratives,
there are also special locative demonstratives, which are discussed in (4.6.3.).
Temporal deixis is discussed briefly in (4.6.4.). Finally, an attempt is made to
summarise the demonstrative system in (4.6.5.).
4.6.1. Orientation: ӻ- and ayKwaza does not have special demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative is expressed by a bound attributive root which requires further derivation by a classifier. This phenomenon is discussed in among others section (7.6.3.). There
are two demonstrative roots: Ϳ- and ay-, and they belong to the group of attributive roots that require a classifier as listed in (4.3.2.2.). They cannot be
used as independent morphemes: *Ϳ, *ay, nor can they be verbalised like verb
roots or noun stems: *Ϳki, *ayki. First when a classifier is attached they can be
used as adverbs, head nouns or attributive modifiers (see 4.3.2.) or, after verbalisation, as predicates:

this-NOM-DEC cup
‘the cup is here, it is this cup’'kopo Ϳ-hͿ-ki
cup this-NOM-DECThe semantics of the demonstrative system is based on the contrast between
speaker-orientedness and hearer-orientedness. Ϳ'hͿ means ‘this one here in my
vicinity’, ay'hͿ means ‘that one there in your vicinity’. The difference between
proximity and distality is a secondary phenomenon which can be elaborated
further through morphological operations introduced below.
The following evidence goes to show that Ϳ- means ‘close to speaker’ and
ay- ‘close to hearer’:
(921) Q: Ϳ-'hͿ-re
this-NOM-INT
‘is it this one?’A: ay-'hͿ-ki
that-NOM-DEC
‘(yes) it’s that one’(922) 'ha-Ϳ-hͿ

‘the thing which you are holding’
(924) ay-'hͿ wa'dy-ta?Ϳ-'ra
that-NOM give-1SO-IMP
‘give me that one there (with you)’137
The distinction between the demonstrative roots may be based on physical
contact. When the hearer holds an object in his hands, the speaker may refer to
the object by ay'hͿ. When the speaker himself holds it he must refer to it by
Ϳ'hͿ.138 However, like many examples in this section show, this is not a prerequisite. One of the attestations of ay'hͿ ‘that one’ was as a warning precisely136.The orders 132 and 213 are also allowed.
137.This example was created by myself as a translation of the Portuguese phrase (mimdá) esse aí (com você), which was given by the consultant as a proper context of use
of ay'hͿ.
138.When the speaker and the hearer together are holding one and the same object in
their hands the object is referred to by Ϳ'hͿ.","[261, 262]"
