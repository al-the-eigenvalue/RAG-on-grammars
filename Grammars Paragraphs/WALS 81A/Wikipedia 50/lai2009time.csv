"442.3.1 Basic Word Order
This section discusses and defines the basic word order of Iquito. The discussion
of basic word order here concerns only the surface word order. It does not deal with
theoretical assumptions concerning the underlying word order from which the surface
word order is derived. The study of basic word order is based on the assumption that
there is always one basic word order in all languages which is syntactically defined by
the relative order among principal constituents. This assumption generally stands except
in the case where the word order of the language is free, is pragmatically constrained or
defined rather than syntactically based, or the appearance of both constituents (i.e.
grammatical subject and object) in a clause is rare, in which case, defining any basic
word order for such languages could be forced to some extent. However, as Mithun
(1987) points out, “for languages with relatively rigid, syntactically defined surface word
order, the establishment of this order at the outset has obvious utility. The description of
rarer, morphologically and pragmatically marked alternative orders as the result of the
movement of constituents out of their normal position is mechanically simple.” The basic
word order of a language refers to the relative order among principal constituents in one
clause. The principal constituents of a transitive clause include subject, verb and object.
Many languages, although not allowing free word order, allow more than one possible
word order. In Iquito, this is also the case. However, a sentence with basic word order is
characterized as being least specific and least marked, morphologically as well as
pragmatically, and although frequency of use is not a necessary part of the definition of
basic word order, in Iquito the most common word order is in fact the basic word order.
This section considers transitive and non-topicalized sentences. Lai (2006) includes
examples of all possible variants which might influence, crosslinguistically, the
placement of nominal phrases, including animacy, definiteness and the weight of the
45phrase, e.g. full phrases vs. pronouns. I argue that the basic word order in Iquito is SVO
instead of SOV and that animacy, definiteness and the phrase weight play no role in
deciding the basic word order for Iquito. The following is a table to illustrate all wordorder variations in a finite clause with one lexical verb.","[62, 63, 64]"
"In the above examples, both subject and object are pronouns.17 Two additional sentences
using full noun phrases as the subject and the object are shown below to demonstrate that
word order patterns remain the same regardless of types of constituents. Example (4) with
a nominal subject and object shows the SVO pattern, and example (5) with a nominal
subject and object shows the SOV pattern.",[66]
"47on defining the basic word order as SVO. I argue in the following that SXV word order is
actually highly marked and that SVO is the true basic one.
Consider first the following two sentences. In (2), we can see that the subject
begins the sentence and the object follows the verb, displaying an SVO pattern. In (3), the
subject and the object are attached together at the beginning of the sentence, displaying
an SOV pattern. Note that pronoun clitics, which are not agreement markers, are not
obligatory if a nominal phrase is used as subject or object.","[65, 66]"
"46the study concludes that animacy, definiteness and phrase weight do not operate on the
pattern of word order in simple transitive clauses and that the basic word order of Iquito
is SVO. In deciding basic word order, this chapter considers sentences containing the
following characteristics: independent transitive clause, affirmative, realis mood and
active voice. In addition, the subject and the object have to be expressed and represented
in complete and full nominal phrases, for example, those including nouns as opposed to
pronouns. In Iquito, there is no agreement information (e.g. person, number, gender,
class, etc.) of grammatical arguments marking on the verb, and the alignment system,
based on word order, exhibits an accusative pattern. It is noted that although pronouns in
Iquito are not agreement inflection markers, they were excluded from the preliminary
stage of investigation and the following examples do not contain them. A sentence with
the basic word order is shown as in (1). As can be seen, the relative order among the
principal constituents in the clause is SVO.","[64, 65]"
"Grammatical mood in Iquito (detailed in §4) is realis or irrealis. Iquito
realis/irrealis mood is expressed by word order change and vowel-hiatus resolution,
72which is unique among strategies that are attested to date. SVO is the basic word order
(Eastman & Eastman, 1963; Lai, 2005) and conveys realis mood. It occurs in finite realis
clauses with no element allowed to appear between the subject and the verb, as in (62)
and (63). Irrealis mood, however, generally requires an element to occupy the position
between the subject and the verb, resulting in SXV word order. The X position in SXV
order can be filled by an indefinite grammatical object (64), a pronoun object (65), the
determiner of a definite object phrase (66) or an adverb (67), among others (Anderson et
al, 2006). In a counterfactual construction, an additional counterfactual morpheme
appears after the subject (68).","[90, 91]"
"In addition to subordinate clauses, Iquito also displays numerous unexpected OV
correlations in terms of word order typology as discussed in Dryer (1991, 1992): (1) it
uses postpositions instead of prepositions; (2) the time/aspect (aux) information follows
the verbal root, utilizing suffixes instead of prefixes; (3) in possessive noun phrases, the
genitive precedes the noun instead of following it; (4) and finally, the copula verb follows
the predicate instead of preceding it. According to typological studies, languages tend to
retain their old word order in embedded clauses. Iquito, therefore, could have once been
an OV language. However, what remains to be confirmed is the motivation of such a
change of basic word order and why SOV, a variety of SXV word order, is retained in
irrealis clauses. Two explanations are offered in the following. One is that in sentences
with S[V(V)….OV] constituent order, all elements after the subject through the sentencefinal verb historically constitute a complex object phrase, with the final verb as the
principal verb. Throughout the historical development, some non-principal lexical verbs
were frequently used and grammaticalized into tense and aspect morphemes, resulting in
grammatical morphemes being positioned in the post-subject position and motivating
the SVO word order in the simple clause. The other possible explanation is that the word
order change in the simple clause is a relatively recent and drastic innovation because
SVO word order, distributively more restricted, only appears in the realis simple clause.
165The motivation of this might be a calque of Spanish sentence structure from the recent
acquisition of the Spanish language. Both options are possible. However, one synchronic
observation is that Arabela, which supposedly forms a branch of the Zaparoan family
with Andoa, is predominantly SOV while Záparo, which supposedly forms a branch with
Iquito, is SVO. SVO word order is therefore a shared innovation, if indeed a new word
order, within the Záparo-Iquito branch. However, an Iquito text in Beuchat and Rivet in
the 18th century displays SVO order (Lev Michael, p.c.). The above discussion suggests
language contact is a less likely scenario since all Zaparoan languages have contact with
Spanish, but present distinct synchronic facts. If SOV is indeed the old word order and
SVO is a new word order, the motivation of such a change remains to be a topic for
future research.
The other possible word-order development is that SVO has been the basic word
order and that SXV is a new strategy in irrealis clauses and a new phenomenon in
embedded infinitival clauses and complex predicate contexts. Complex predicates,
especially complements of cognition verbs and the like, might plausibly be associated
with irrealis mood (Patience Epps, p.c.). Here the explanation needed is the mechanism
of such a word-order-change strategy. Hopper and Thompson (1980) correlate variations
in word order and relative verbal transitivity, such as noun incorporation, with
affectedness or individuation of object, which is also associated with irrealis mood. It is,
therefore, that noun incorporation is the drive of SVO to SXV change. However, this
scenario seems unlikely since there is almost no noun incorporation in Iquito, which is
distinct from most of the Amazonian languages. The motivation of SVO to SXV change
also remains to be a topic for future research.
§4.2 above gives an outline of the Iquito irrealis mood. It discusses the structural
facts of the realis and irrealis word order, and the kinds of semantic contexts in which
166each mood is employed. Iquito evidently adopts an extremely uncommon strategy, word
order change, to encode the irrealis mood. The present study proposes to include this as
one of the grammatical types by which modality can be expressed typologically. The
discussion of this section also attempts to trace the origin of this uncommon means from
a typological approach on word-order correlations. It is suggested that the earlier word
order of Iquito might have been SOV and it gradually developed into SVO word order.
This section also establishes that the choice of the terms realis and irrealis is based on the
fact that these two terms represent two different constructions which are consistently used
in sentences of different modal functions.","[183, 184, 185]"
"Moreover, when the subject is indefinite, the word order in an intransitive clause is SV
instead of VS. It is noted that the translation of subject phrase in English shows that it is
semantically and syntactically indefinite in this language. Example (19) shows that the
bare nominal subject precedes the verb.",[72]
"In (286), the negative particle caa both precedes and follows the verb marked with -ji.
The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’
and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order to
express the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.",[193]
"54The syntactic behaviors of S and O, in terms of positions appearing in the clause and the
discontinuous pattern pertaining to the context of definiteness, are totally different. We
could not group S and O together to say that this is an ergative language.
Besides all the above-mentioned points, the SVO word order indeed appears very
frequently in the texts, and it is usually the word order which starts a discourse. Based on
all these factors, SVO should be considered as the basic word order which fulfills the
criterion of descriptive simplicity.","[72, 73]"
"It is important to mention that SV is basic word order in intransitives, just as in
transitive clauses. When the subject is a non-topicalized, definite nominal phrase, only
the definite article precedes the verb, with the bare nominal remaining after the verb. As
can be seen in (17), the determiner iina begins the sentence and appears before the verb
and the bare subject appears after, showing a discontinuous S. The word order in example
(17) is DVS (D stands for determiner/demonstrative).",[71]
"4.2.3 Possible Origins69 of Irrealis Word order
Expressing mood through word order change is typologically unusual and
interesting. So far, there has not been another language reported in the literature that
utilizes a comparable approach. Irrealis word order in Iquito might be the result of a word
order retention or word order change through historical development. That is to say, it is
possible that 1) SOV (i.e. as one of the varieties of SXV word order) is the old word
order and is retained in infinitival clauses as well as retained in or extended to irrealis
clauses, or that 2) SVO has been the word order and SXV is a new strategy in irrealis
clauses.
Synchronically, in all sentences with a complex verbal predicate, such as those
including embedded infinitival clauses (although not in all kinds of subordinated clauses)
besides the main verb, the word order does not display a straightforward SVO pattern.
Instead, it exhibits a SV(V)...OV pattern. Given the fact that infinitival clauses, which
have an ‘irrealis-like’ (i.e. talking about unrealized situations) element, it is not difficult
to understand why two types of clauses could share the same word-order pattern.
Examples (266) and (267) are sentences in realis mood with complex verbal phrases.",[180]
"Sentence (262) is analyzed as taking a non-finite participle phrase as the object and hence
does not use the irrealis word order.",[178]
"In (263), qu+r++- ‘fear’ is the matrix verb and the subordinate clause also exhibits
irrealis word order. In the subordinate clause, iina m+yaara ‘that dog’ is in the topic
position and the resumptive subject pronoun nu ‘3S’ precedes the definite article of the
object.",[178]
"It is seen that all three sentences above with complex predicates display the same word
order pattern—SV(V)…OV. Mood is only expressed in the finite clause and does not
determine the order of the non-finite clause since the grammatical information of
finiteness is not relevant. In addition, because the subject of the verb in a non-finite
clause is not always present and, therefore, there is no condition of talking about mood
construction, which is based principally on the adjacency of subject and verb. The word
order of non-finite clauses can be variable. The following three sentences have their
embedded clauses as non-finite.
163(269) Qui=nacar++-yaa-Ø quia=asaani=iiraiina papaaja.","[181, 182]"
"In addition, when the definite S is topicalized, leaving behind a resumptive subject
pronoun preceding the verb, the word order is—S, SV as shown in (20).",[72]

definiteness, animacy, and the weight of the nominal phrases and investigate seven
different categories of subject as well as object. The seven categories include ‘inanimate
indefinite,’ ‘inanimate definite,’ ‘animate indefinite,’ ‘animate definite,’ ‘personal
indefinite,’ ‘personal definite’ and ‘proper name.’ These seven different categories,
applying to the subject and object, generate forty-nine different expressions. The result of14 The abbreviations in the chart stand for the following:
A: adverb; D: determiner; V: verb; O: object, including pronouns or the nominal part of the grammatical
object; S: subject, including pronouns or the nominal part of the grammatical subject.",[64]
"Examples (449)-(452) show the imperatives of Accomplishments with explicit
plural addressees and Deictic Perfective Aspects. The subject pronoun is not optional. It
can also be observed that the word order of the sentences reflects SVX realis word order.",[269]
"In (284), caa precedes and follows the verb which is marked with -ji. The questioned
element here is the subject as well. However, the object nu-naana ‘his wood’ does not
appear between the subject and the verb, but remains in the postverbal position. In
comparison with the above example, the negative particle caa in the current example
appears postverbally as well as preverbally, forming a linear SXV Word order to fulfill
the requirement of irrealis mood. Compare this sentence with (286) below.",[192]
"One might attempt to group S and O together as opposed to A (i.e. agent, the subject of a
transitive verb) in terms of grammatical relations, based on the subject position shown in
53(17). However, there are several points we have to make clear. While we can get a
discontinuous S in a realis indicative single-verb intransitive clause, we never get a
discontinuous O in a realis indicative single-verb transitive clause. As can be seen in (18),
the word order is DAVDO (SVO). We do not get a discontinuous O.","[71, 72]"
"So far, both SVO and SOV word orders seem to be unmarked in the sentences in the
Extended Current Tense. However, the following discussion shows that SXV word order
is actually highly marked in all other environments.
In the past-tense environment, SVO word order maintains the same kinds of
morphological markings, while SOV word order cannot appear with only tense-aspect
information as demonstrated above in (3) and (5), but has to be accompanied by either
counterfactual or hypothetical morphemes.18 As can be seen in (1) above, SVO word
order in the past-tense environment only changes its tense morpheme and so still has the
same kinds of morphological markings. However, SXV word order in the past context
can only be used in conditional and counterfactual constructions and has to be
accompanied by either the non-assertive hypothetical morpheme or the counterfactual
morpheme. It cannot be used with just tense-aspect information. Example (6) is a case
with a counterfactual morpheme. As can be seen, the counterfactual morpheme -t++ and
indirect O nu ‘3S’ are inserted between S and V, providing evidence to support the claim
that SXV, with intervening elements between S and V, is a marked word order.",[67]
"160view is that it might not be treated as part of the realis/irrealis system. Realis clauses
display SVX word order and present vowel-hiatus resolution. Irrealis clauses, on the
other hand, generally require an element to occupy the position between the subject and
the verb. The X position is not always filled by a lexical element if the verb is
intransitive, and the vowel-hiatus resolution strategy is blocked. Interestingly, in
imperatives of intransitive verbs, as in (264), vowel hiatus resolution is also suspended
(i.e. two vowels are pronounced distinctively), resembling the phonological
characteristics of irrealis mood constructions. However, in imperatives of transitive
verbs, as in (265), the object follows the verb, displaying SVO word order, resembling
the syntactic characteristics of realis mood constructions. It is ungrammatical if the object
appears between the subject and the verb in an imperative. Mood assignment in Iquito
imperatives is, therefore, an on-going puzzle at this point of research.[p+iisacuaa]

"In addition to the above-mentioned contexts, desideratives are frequently used to rephrase
the commands (i.e. imperatives which impose obligation on the addressee) or wishes (i.e.
CF wishes which do not impose obligation on the addressee) of other people. As a
consequence, the rephrased sentence is ambiguous as to whether the subject of the
sentence imposes obligation on the realization of the event. The subject of the verb
nacar++- ‘want,’ the person who expresses the expectation, can be any grammatical
person. Sentence (371) is used in the following scenario. The addressee is hard of hearing
and couldn’t hear the hostess utter the imperative sentence, as in (372). A person sitting
next to the addressee rephrased the imperative sentence and told him what the hostess
said. The speaker of (372), which is not a syntactic argument in the sentence, corresponds
to the subject of (371). The implicit subject in (372) appears to be the subject, quia=
‘2S,’ of the complement clause in (371). The object of (372), iina itíniija ‘this masato,’
corresponds to the object of the complement clause in (371). It is noted that the word
order of the complement clause in (371) is SXV, an irrealis word order.",[236]
"In Iquito, word order conveys grammatical mood: SVX (realis mood) and SXV
(irrealis mood). Note that SOV is one of the varieties of SXV orders detailed below.
Irrealis mood is characterized as allowing an intervening element between the subject and
the verb in the X position. A variety of elements could appear in the X position, including
grammatical object and adverbs, among others, as detailed in §4.2. This section focuses15 The Recent Past Tense gives an RT frame from the day prior to SpT extending to one to two years prior.",[65]
"4.2 GRAMMATICAL MOOD: REALIS AND IRREALIS
Iquito has a grammaticalized realis/irrealis mood which is expressed by a
typologically uncommon strategy, word order change and vowel-hiatus resolution.55 The
basic word order in Iquito is SVO, which appears in all finite clauses with realis mood.
Irrealis mood in finite clauses,56 however, generally requires an element to occupy the
position between the subject and the verb, resulting in SXV word order. The X position
in an SXV order can be filled by an indefinite grammatical object, an adverb, or the
determiner of a definite object phrase, among others (Anderson et al., 2006). To add to
what is proposed in this literature, I propose that when the X position is not filled by an
overt lexical item, the vowel-hiatus resolution strategy between S and V is blocked.
Because the SXV order conveys the irrealis meaning and imposes syntactic restrictions
on the overall sentence structure, mood in Iquito can be viewed as a grammaticalized
category. Following Bybee (1998: 264), I consider the entire SXV construction as being
responsible for expressing irrealis mood.57 The binary terms ‘realis’ and ‘irrealis’ are
used in this dissertation because these two specific terms are useful, as promoted by
many linguists (Elliot 2000; Mithun 1995, 1999; Palmer 2001), in this case to best
characterize two constructions which systematically apply to clauses with certain modal
functions. ‘Realis’ and ‘irrealis,’ however, do not correspond exactly in meaning to real55 Please refer to Huamancayo (2003), which specifically discusses vowel hiatus resolution in Iquito. Also
see footnote 24 for more information.
56 In complex sentences which contain embedded infinitival clauses, the word order is neutralized to
SV….OV (i.e. with no interrupting element between the subject and the main verb), regardless of mood.
Please see §4.2.3 for more discussion.
57 For a theoretical analysis of irrealis mood, please refer to Anderson et al. (2006).",[159]

"In (362), the verb nacar++- ‘want’ takes an inflected clausal complement. The
embedded clause reflects the irrealis word order SXV, with the determiner of the object
phrase situated between the subject and the verb. General Perfective Aspect is used in the
embedded clause to indicate that the speaker expects the addressee to realize the event
soon after SpT. Sentence (363) shows that the demonstrative iina and the embedded finite
clause in (362) are in equivalent positions in terms of clausal structure.",[233]
"4.2.1 The Structural Characteristics of Realis and Irrealis Mood
The clauses with realis mood display SVX word order, with no element allowed
to appear between the subject and the verb. In addition, vowel-hiatus resolution, detailed
below, appears in realis clauses. In contrast, clauses with irrealis mood display SXV word
order, with an element (X) standing between the subject (S) and the verb (V). The
categories that can appear in this X position are summarized in table 6. It is noted that
this position is not always filled by a lexical element if the verb is intransitive. Under
such circumstances, the interpretation of realis or irrealis mood is determined by the
blockage of vowel hiatus, or by pragmatic knowledge.",[161]
"CF=drink-CAU-MMT.PFV masato3SI wish she could drink masato!
(Literally: Would it make her drink masato!)Irrealis word order appears in the subordinate clauses of desiderative/timitive
verbs. The matrix verb of (260) and (261) is nacar++- ‘want/like/hope’ and the
subordinated finite clause, as indicated by square brackets, exhibits irrealis word order.",[177]
"Note that in sentences with a complex verbal predicate, for example, those having
embedded infinitival clauses besides the main verb, the word order does not display a
straightforward SVO pattern. Instead, it exhibits an SVV...OV pattern, which is also the
case in the irrealis environment (SOV word order). Example (15) is an example of a
complex verbal phrase in the SVO environment, and (16) is an example of it in the SOV
environment. It is seen that both sentences using complex predicates display the same
word order pattern—SVV…OV—no matter whether they are in realis mood (SVX) or in
irrealis mood (SXV).",[70]
"Unlike caa negation, ji-caa negation presents many syntactic variations sensitive
to mood (i.e. in irrealis clauses). The negative particle in such clauses can appear after the
verb, as in the basic pattern, before and after the verb, or only before the verb in some
cases. Recalling the requirement of irrealis mood (i.e. one element should occupy the
position between the subject and the verb), when this requirement is fulfilled, then caa
173stays in the postverbal position, maintaining the basic pattern. When the object of a
clause is dislocated to form a wh-question, or stays in the postverbal position, the
negative particle caa appears between the subject and the verb, by which the requirement
of irrealis mood is fulfilled. Sometimes, when caa already appears in the preverbal
position, it does not appear again in the postverbal position. In each variation, the verb is
obligatorily marked with the negative morpheme -ji.
In sentence (283), -ji marks the verb, followed by the negative particle caa,
displaying the basic pattern of ji-caa negation. The wh-word is the subject, followed by
the object phrase nu-nasi ‘his garden,’72 followed in turn by the verb. This is the
configuration of irrealis mood (SXV word order).","[191, 192]"

"The possible positions of adverbs for both SVX and SXV word orders are nonargument positions including topic, pre-subject and post-verbal positions. However, in
SXV sentences, adverbs are also allowed to appear in the X position where a grammatical
object could appear, indicating that SXV word order is relatively marked. Example (7)
shows that the temporal adverb amicaáca ‘one day away (i.e. yesterday/tomorrow)’
occupies the X position in the SXV sentences. Example (8) shows that such a sentence is
ungrammatical in the past context without the counterfactual morpheme or the nonassertive hypothetical morpheme. Examples (9) and (10) show that the temporal adverb

"A conditional construction in Iquito consists of two clauses—an antecedent clause
and a consequent clause. There is a fairly strong preference for ordering the antecedent
clause before the consequent clause. There are counterfactual (CF) and noncounterfactual (non-CF) conditionals (detailed in §4.4) in Iquito. Tense, Mood, and
Aspect in both CF and non-CF conditionals is ‘real’ in the sense that they receive the
67same temporal, modal and aspectual interpretations as they do in non-conditionals. The
counterfactuality difference between CF conditionals and non-CF conditionals is
expressed by a specialized CF morpheme (+)t+,22 which always accompanies SXV
irrealis word order and conveys CF meaning by entailment instead of implicature. As in
(52), the CF morpheme appears directly following the subject, in this case, between the
subject and the adverb in the antecedent clause and between the subject and the definite
article of the object phrase in the consequent clause. The object phrase in the consequent
clause is discontinuous as the definite article precedes the verb while the nominal follows
the verb.","[85, 86]"
"4.6.1 Imperatives
Imperative constructions are used to address interlocutors in the first person plural

plural, as in (417). Imperatives are observed to reflect SVX realis word order, instead of
SXV irrealis word order, but with the non-vowel hiatus phonemenon, a characteristic of
irrealis mood. It is noted that the addressees are also the action-performing referents in
the sentences. If the addressee is second person singular, the subject pronoun is omitted,
otherwise it appears before the verbs.",[259]

"5.2.3.1 Immediate Future Context
When referring to future situations, speakers use different strategies according to
temporal distance, relative to SpT. When speakers talk about events that will take place
on the same day, they very often use Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -: with realis word order
(SVX), seeing the SpT as part of the entire situation, hence already in progress. They can
also use GNRPFV -qui ~ -Ø with irrealis word order (SXV), seeing the situation as more
distant temporally and SpT as not part of the entire situation. An utterance of this type is
less common, but is sometimes encountered. Finally, they can also use Momentary
Perfective Aspect -r++ with irrealis word order (SXV), seeing the situation with even
greater temporal distance. The difference between the second (GNRPFV with irrealis
word order) and the third (Momentary Perfective Aspect with the irrealis word order)
297strategies is that the second strategy does not require an explicit temporal reference and
the situation is understood to be realized later in the same day of SpT. The third strategy,
however, requires an explicit temporal reference if the sentence indicates an event which
will take place on the same day. Without a specific temporal reference, the interpretation
is that the event will take place within a few days up to a month. To refer to a longer
distance in time, Remote Perfective Aspect -maa with irrealis word order is used. The
interpretation is that the event will take place within a month, up to a few years. To refer
to an even longer temporal distance, Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -:, in combination with
the potential/optative -cuma and irrealis word order, is used. The interpretation is that the
event will presumably take place in the very distant future.
Example (557) is uttered in the late afternoon and speakers choose to use realis
word order with Imperfective Aspect.(557) Ácari iina

nightsuhuaata.","[315, 316]"
"Finally, non-CF conditionals can also be used to express future situations.
Extended Current Tense is used in both clauses. The non-assertive morpheme sacari and
the realis word order SVX are used in antecedents while the irrealis word order SXV is
used in consequents. Aspect morphology in the antecedent depends on the indicated
meaning. A variety of perfective aspects, depending on the remoteness of future
indicated, are used in consequents.
Example (311) concerns an immediate future situation later in the same day which
includes SpT. The antecedent contains a Stative verb and the Imperfective Aspect is used,
indicating overlapping SitT of situations in two clauses. The sentence means ‘I will visit
you during the time while I can.’ It can be seen that Extended Current Tense is used in
both clauses. The antecedent exhibits realis word order while the consequent exhibits
irrealis word order.",[206]
"Statives also cannot appear as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ as in (994) and (995).",[467]
"5.2 GENERAL PERFECTIVE ASPECT
5.2.1 General Characterization of Semantics and Forms
This section discusses General Perfective Aspect (glossed as GNR.PFV; referred
to as GNRPFV hereafter in this chapter) in Iquito. GNRPFV is used in past contexts with
realis106 word order (SVX), in immediate-future107 contexts with irrealis word order
(SXV), and in imperative constructions. This section discusses the first two contexts in
detail and briefly includes its use in imperatives which is discussed in detail in §4.6.
When used in the past context, it conveys a bounded (i.e. closed) event in which SitT
overlaps with RT. It generally renders an inceptive reading in Stative sentences. When
the adverbial jaa ‘already’ is used, the sentence presents properties of the perfect in
which SitT precedes RT. When used in the context of the immediate future, the sentence
106 For a detailed discussion of grammatical mood, please refer to §4.
107 When speakers talk about events that will take place on the same day, they use different strategies:Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -: with the realis word order (SVO) if they view the situation as already in
progress; General Perfective Aspect -qui ~ -Ø with the irrealis word order (SXV) if they view the situation
as being realized later on the day of SpT with more distance; Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ with the
irrealis word order (SXV) if they view the situation with even greater temporal distance.",[294]
"142these contexts are discussed in detail in subsequent sections. In §4.2.3, I propose possible
origins and motivations of word order change.","[160, 161]"
"As is seen in (285), the sentence is ungrammatical when the object as well as the negative
particle remain in the postverbal positions (i.e. nothing appears between the subject and
the verb in a transitive irrealis clause).",[193]

"170The final point of caa negation is that the negative structure is not sensitive to
mood. That is to say, the syntactic position of the negative particle does not vary because
of the grammatical mood. Sentence (276) expresses realis mood (SVX word order), with
General Perfective Aspect and Recent Past Tense, while sentence (279) expresses irrealis
mood (SXV order), with Momentary Perfective Aspect and Extended Current Tense. The
negative particle caa in both sentences follows the topicalized element and precedes the
pronominal subject, remaining in the same position structurally.","[188, 189]"
"Achievements are dynamic and appear in imperative constructions, as in (957) and (958),
and as the complement of the verb ‘order,’ as in (959) and (960).",[457]
"It is important to mention that when the negative particle caa already appears in
the preverbal position, in order to fulfill the requirement of irrealis mood, the sentence is
also grammatical if it does not appear in the postverbal position again. This phenomenon
is especially common in intransitive clauses, although it is also observed in transitive
clauses. In (287), caa appears after the wh-word, which is the subject, to fulfill the irrealis

"In (737), the object of the sentence is a pronoun. It can be seen that the pronominal object
cliticizes onto the subject noun in the irrealis clause. In realis sentences, the pronoun
object stays in the post-verbal position, as in (747).",[384]
"51marked structure. Example (13) shows that caa follows the interrogative subject and then
precedes as well as follows the verb. In (14), the interrogative object begins the sentence.
The negative particle caa follows the pronoun subject and then precedes as well as
follows the verb. The fact that caa can also occupy the object position in the SOV
environment further supports the idea that the SOV pattern is highly marked.","[69, 70]"
