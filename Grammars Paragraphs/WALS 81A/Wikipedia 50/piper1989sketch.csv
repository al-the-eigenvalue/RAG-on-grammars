"Language Oassification and Type.
Unlike its neighbour Kala Lagaw Ya, which is classified as an Australian
Paman language, Meryam Mir is classified by Wurm (Ibid) as a Papuan language
of the Trans-Fly stock with a close genetic relationship to the languages of the
Eastern Trans-Fly Family, Bine, Gidra and Gizra.
Its phonology is relatively simple, comprising a three way distinction in
point of articulation for oral voiced and voiceless stops (bilabial, alveolar and
velar) and a two way distinction in point of articulation for nasal stops and glides
1(bilabial and alveolar). The remaining consonants, a voiced and voiceless
fricative, a lateral and a rhotic tap, are all produced at the alveolar point of
articulation. The language has a five vowel system contrasting front and back
vowels /i, e/ and /u, o/ with a low central vowel /a/. The pitch-accent is
phonemically significant in the language, serving to distinguish certain lexical
items. Every word bears a high pitch on either the first or second syllable with
the majority of words carrying high pitch on the second syllable. The phonology
is covered in Chapter 1.
The following word classes can be distinguished: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, deictics and interjections. Nouns and pronouns are
inflected for syntactic and non-syntactic cases. The cases are: ergative,
nominative, accusative, instrumental, allative (which includes some of the
functions of dative in other languages), ablative, locative, associative (which
could be labelled alternatively 'comitative') and genitive. There is a split case
marking system with an ergative case pattern on nouns for subjects of transitive
verbs and a nominative case pattern on pronouns for subjects of transitive or
intransitive verbs. Within the noun category, a distinction can be drawn between
common and proper nouns. With proper nouns, there is a three way split in the
case marking system with distinct inflections for the subject of a transitive verb,
the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Adjectives
as well as possessors marked by the genitive immediately precede the noun
which they modify and are thus syntactically dependent on the noun which is the
head.
Pronouns distinguish between first, second and third person with a further
distinction contrasting inclusion and exclusion for first person nonsingular. In
addition, there are distinct forms for the singular versus non-singular. There is
no gender distinction with third person. Word classes and nominals are covered
in Chapter 2.
Verbs can be categorised into two classes: atelic stative and telic active.
These classes are morphologically determined since the atelic stative verbs only
include intransitive verbs which mark the subject by means of a prefix, whereas
the telic active verbs mark either the transitive or intransitive subject
predominantly by means of a suffix. The two verb classes are partially
semantically motivated as suggested by the names atelic stative and telic active.
Verbal cross-reference markers encode information about both number,
distinguishing singular, dual, paucal and plural, and to some degree, person.
Time is divided up along the lines of present versus non-present where
present refers to events that occurred any time on the same day as the utterance
and non-present for events that occurred on another day or will occur following
the utterance. There are also aspectual features such as the imperfective and the
perfective. In addition, there is a mood marker, the irrealis non-committal,2which conveys the lack of commitment on behalf of the speaker to say whether
something will happen or not. Temporal, aspectual and mood categories, crossreference markers and other features of the verbal morphology are covered in
Chapter 3. Included in this chapter is a brief survey of adverbs, their formation
and function.
There is a rich and complex system of deixis in the language which is
explored in Chapter 4. Deictic markers' forms are determined by the temporal
occurrence of the event relative to the time of the utterance. Their function is to
essentially focus on various elements in space, time and in discourse itself.
Existential/locational verbs, intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
form the basis of simple clauses. However, there are many events or states which
are expressed by complex verbal phrases consisting of a noun and verb with
nominals forming an essential part of the verbal's meaning. In such instances,
the whole verb phrase must be regarded as a complex head. There are no valency
changing operations except for an intransitiviser morpheme. A verb's valency is
more or less fixed with some non-productive morphemes affecting the verb's
transitivity and with periphrastic constructions for expressing inchoative and
causative meanings. Basic sentence types, verbal and nominal phrases as well as
some complex sentences are briefly examined in Chapter 5.
The following study is a sketch grammar of Meryam Mir with special
attention to verbal morphology and the system of deixis.","[12, 13, 14]"
"The Language and its Speakers.
Meryam Mir is one of three languages spoken in the Torres Strait, that
stretch of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea (see Kmao lh.
!Ca.klw a.Wo.w d J
on p. iv). The other two languages are Kala Lagaw Ya (also known ast\1(alaw
Lagaw Langgus, Mabuiag or Yagar Yagar, see Kennedy 1985 and Ford and Ober
1987; 1), which is spoken on the Western islands, and Torres Strait Creole (also
known as Broken, Pizin, Big Thap, Blaikman or Ailan Tok, see Shnukal, 1988; 3)
which is the lingua franca of the region. Meryam Mir was spoken throughout
the Eastern islands of Erub (Darnley Island), Ugar.(Stephen Island) and Mer
(Murray Island). However, with the ever-increasing use of Creole, Meryam Mir
has been seriously impinged upon and, as a consequence, it is being spoken less
and less in these communities. The number of speakers are estimated to be
approximately 700 (Wurm, 1977; 328)1 which presumably includes Eastern Torres
Strait Islanders living on other islands of the Torres Strait and on the mainland
of Australia in cities such as Townsville, Cairns or Mackay.
The name itself, Meryam Mir, is drawn from the word mir meaning 'word,
language' and from the name of one of the clans living on Mer, the Meryam
people (from Mer 'Murray Island' and the morpheme -(y)am '(?)of a clan, of a
place'). It frequently appears in the literature written as Miriam or Meriam (Mir)
but to be consistent with the orthography used in this study, Meryam (Mir) is
chosen.
Meryam Mir has an agglutinating morphology employing both prefixes
and suffixes. Its word order is basically A-0-V or S-V with the verb always in
word final position but with variation on the arguments' order depending on
pragmatic features. It has an extensive system of cross-reference markers on the
verb coding information about the number, person and syntactic nature of the
arguments as well as case inflections suffixed on nouns to indicate their syntactic
function within a clause. Thus, Meryam Mir can be regarded in typological
terms as a double-marking language (Nichols 1986; 72).

"ABSTRACT.
Meryam Mir is a Papuan language spoken in the Torres Strait, that stretch
of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It has an A-0-V
or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology. Case inflections are
suffixed to nominals to mark their syntactic role in the clause. Markers crossreferencing the syntactic arguments of the clause are affixed to the verb indicating
number and, to some degree, person. In typological terms, the language can be
regarded as a double-marking language.
The following study is a sketch grammar of the language. Chapter 1 deals
with the phonology. Chapter 2 examines briefly the different word classes and
nominal morphology. Chapter 3 looks at verbals and their morphology. In
Chapter 4, the system of deictic markers is presented outlining some of its
functions and meanings. In Chapter 5, basic features of the syntax are outlined.","[2, 3]"

BASIC SYNTAX5.1Introduction.
Before examining clause types, it is worth briefly mentioning that word
order tends to be A-0-V or S-V with local arguments either following or
preceding the nucleus. Variations on this order are presumably the result of
pragmatics although this awaits a detailed study. Roles and functions of
arguments are morphologically marked through case suffixes with syntactic cases
only being cross-referenced on the verb.
Causes.
A clause must minimally consist of a verb. This corresponds roughly to a
simple sentence if one includes a verb's arguments. Different types of simple
clauses can be broadly categorised as follows:
1.
Equational type clauses:
(5.1)
e
[aw sirib+sirib daIi]
3SgS big shameAdj n PIS be(person)-Primpf
'She is ashamed.'
(5.2)
lokot [pe irdi]

'The bush is there.'
(5.3)

lSgGen names S. n PIS be(word)
'My name is Sir.'
2.
Experiencer type clauses:
(5.4)
yaba
werer barug- da
3n SgGen hungers happen-P£Pl
'They felt hungry.'
3.
An intransitive verb with an S argument:
(5.5)

emrida
3SgS Sg/DualS sit down-Pf
'He sat down.'
(i)]
[kobek esi(5.6)
newr
(unmarried) females cough bang down on waves-Pf
'The girl coughed.'
5.21834.
A transitive verb with an A and 0 argument (either explicit or implicit):
(5.7)
koskiride u
ikris- Ii
(married) female-A coconutO scrape-Prlmpf
'The woman is scraping a coconut.'
(5.8)
ka
emetu irw-i
lSgA finish eat-Pf
'I have eaten.'
(5.9)
able neys nar miwsriyey
Det two boatO 3n SgO-drag up on shore-PfDual
'The two boats got dragged up.'
(5.10) ka uteb [lumi dikris- i]
lSgA placeO weed scrape-Pf
'I cleared the place.'
5.
A di-transitive verb with an A and two 0 arguments:
(5.11) ka
abi bawr ikwari
lSgA 3Sg0 spearO give Sg/DualO-Pf
'I gave him a spear.'
(5.12) ka
abi zyawali etomeda
lSgA 3Sg0 bookO show Sg/DualA/0-PfSg
'I showed him the book.'
In addition, clauses may be extended by a number of peripheral adjuncts.
These include instrumental and comitative phrases, locational and temporal
phrases:
(5.13) ka ekyam- da ut- lam
lSgS wake up-PfSg sleep-Abl
'I woke up from (being) asleep.'
(5.14) abgerger-ge kole
ta- bakyamu- da tawn-em

'Yesterday, the European came to town.'
(5.15) ka lukupu
desaw-i
lSgA ointment-Instr rubPf
'I rubbed it with ointment.'
Clause types 1. and 2. will first be examined. Clause types 3. to 5. that is
intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs will only be discussed in the
context of determining which of their arguments are syntactic and which are
non-syntactic, and whether the verb's valency is fixed or with some variation.
Problems of this nature arise from the fact there are complex verb phrases in the
language and that not all arguments need be overtly expressed. Special attention
will be paid to cross-reference markers to show their role in this area.","[193, 194, 195]"
"291here are a number of existential/locational verbs whose choice is determined by
features such as animacy, shape and location of the subject.
Adjectives.
Adjectives are essentially a closed class. These include: aw 'big', kebi 'little,
young', debe 'good', adud 'bad'. Also included in this class are determiners and
quantifier words such as netat 'one', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several',
mitkar 'alot', gayr 'many'. As these items are the most representative of
adjectives cross-linguistically, it seems plausible that these are the basic adjectives
with others being derived from nouns or verbs. Words which function as
adjectives modify a noun in some way or are used attributively in a predicative
construction. Their position in the sentence is either before the noun which they
modif)j or preceding an existential verb when they are used with an ascriptive
function.
Pronouns.
Included in this class are personal, interrogative and indefinite pronouns.
Personal pronouns are a closed class of shifters. The interrogative and indefinite
pronouns differ from personal pronouns syntactically in that the former,
interrogatives and indefinites, inflect for case like nouns; the latter, personal
pronouns, inflect for case by opposing A/S to 0, i.e. on a nominative-accusative
pattern.
Adverbs.
Words in this class serve to modify the verb in some way either in
manner, e.g. dudum+dudum ""quickly"", or in time, e.g. mena 'continue, remain,
still', etc. They are a closed class of words but it is possible through derivation to
extend this class from other word classes. Adverbs do not bear any inflections
and occur in a position preceding the verb.
Deictic Markers.
This is a closed word class in which items occur as phonologically
independent units but do not constitute independent utterances by themselves.
Their forms are determined by the time of the event relative to the time of the
speech act utterance. Aspects of their meaning involve place, e.g. here/there;
time, e.g. now I then; referent, e.g. this one, that one; logical relations, e.g. but,
instead, what has been said, what is about to be said.
Clause Relators.
Items in this closed class serve to link two syntactic elements together.
These might be two phrases or two clauses (and in the case of the conjunction a,30this can also be two words). Little can be said about relators without a full study
of the types of clause linkage. There will be no discussion about them and they
are simply listed with an example of each in the chapter on basic syntax. Note
that deictic markers are also used in this category or rather exploited in this
category to link two syntactic units together.
Exclamations/Interjections.
Within this class of words are items which have no syntactic value and
which can occur as a complete utterance. Examples include waw 'yes', nole 'no',
way (-wey) 'alas, poor one, dear one', megiyem 'yuk' (lit: vomit-All), mayem
'welcome', erarem 'boring' (lit: tired-All), akame-akasi 'to express surprise,
incredulity', no bes mimi 'see you later' (lit: Restr lie wander), baru 'okay'. Items
in this class need not belong exclusively to this class. Thus, an item such as menaJ
which was discussed earlier as an adverb meaning 'keep on, remaining still', may
also be used as an interjection meaning 'hang on, wait'. This class will not be
discussed further.
Noun Morphology.
Nouns_, whether functioning as syntactic or local arguments of the verb,
must be suffixed with a case inflection. The choice of inflection is determined by
the case frame of the verb and the type of nominal; that is whether it is a
common or proper noun.","[40, 41, 42]"
"5.2.2 Experiencer type Clauses.
There is only one verb which has been collected to date where the
agreement on the verb appears to be determined by the number of the possessor,
not the number of the possessed. Consider the following examples:
(5.30) kara
nyap bark- i
1SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
'I am thirsty I Thirst happened to me.'
(5.31) yaba
nyap barug- da
3n SgGen thirstS happen-PfPl
'They were thirsty I Thirst happened to them.'
(5.32) keriba
werer bark- iyey
ln SgExclGen hungers happen-PfDual
'We two (excl.) are hungry I Hunger happened to us (excl).'
The experience itself could be regarded as either the same phenomenon
shared by all experiencers, in which case, one would expect singular marking on
the verb or it could be regarded as a phenomenon experienced individually by
each of the experiencers. It is this latter interpretation which is suggested by the
verbal marking. Alternatively, the structure suggests that the possessor has
subject properties by virtue of its initial position in the clause and verb
agreement.
Both this construction and equational clauses can be used for experiences.
The distinction between the two is unclear:186(5.33)e
nyap-ge daIi
3SgS thirst-Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is thirsty.'
(5.34) abra
nyap bark- i
3SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
'He is (now) thirsty I Thirst happened to him.'
The distinction may be that existential sentences convey a state whereas
experiencer type clauses convey a change of state, or it may be that one state is
more permanent than another. Examples need to be elicited to test whether both
types can be modified by the same set of adverbial/temporal modifiers:
?e no kerkar nyapge dali/?abra nyap no kerkar bark-i 'He is just recently thirsty.'
?e emetu nyap-ge daw-i/?abra nyap emetu bark-i 'He was already thirsty.'
?'He is always thirsty.'
5.3The Verb Complex.
There are a number of uninflected nominals occurring within a sentence.
These must be considered as part of the verb complex. Consider the following
examples:
(5.35) ter mayso [mir iga- Ii]
reef noises word speak-Prlmpf
'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.36) Galiga [ut iperedi]
G.S
sleep n PIS be lying-Pr
'Galiga is sleeping.'
The nominals mir 'word' and ut 'sleep' must be part of the verbal phrase
for the following reasons. The verbs given above are intransitive as evidenced by
zero marking on the S argument so the non-S argument cannot be 0. Its
function must be part of the verb phrase. Other arguments found in support of
this analysis follow.
Nominals in the verbal phrase must occur immediately preceding the verb,
which suggests they form a syntactic unit:
(5.37) *mir ter mayso igali
'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.38) *ut Galiga iperedi
'Galiga is sleeping.'
There is some suprasegmental evidence that the nominal and verb form a
single phonological unit. The main pitch-accent of the verb phrase is carried on
the nominal when it is mono-syllabic and the verb itself begins with a vowel,
e.g. tit ipe 'n PIS be lying asleep', but ipe 'n PIS be lying'.
However, there are instances where the nominal's role is not
straightforward and it could either be a verbal nominal (i.e. within the verbal
187complex) or a syntactic argument of the verb. Consider the following examples
where the verb might be di-transitive or transitive with a complex verb phrase:
(5.39) koskiride lumi dikris-li
uteb- ge
(married)female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
'The woman is clearing her place.'
(5.40) koskiride (uteb) lumi dikris-li
(married)female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
'The woman is clearing (her place).'
In 5.39, number reference for the nonA nominal (be it 0 or whatever) is
automatically plural and no further cross-reference marking can be used. As 0
arguments for transitive verbs can be cross-referenced on the verb for number,
one must assume that the nominal is not an 0 and thus part of the verb complex.
Contrasting with this, in 5.40, number specification for 0 is singular, referring to
the number of yards, and cross-reference marking can be used to indicate
nonsingular number as exemplified below:
(5.41) koskiride neys uteb lumi da-rakris- i
(married)female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf
'The woman cleared two yards.'
(5.42) koskiride neys a
netat uteb lumi da-rakris- idare
(married)female-A two Conj one placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pauc
'The woman cleared several yards.'
(5.43) koskiride mitkar uteb lumi da-rakris- a
(married)female-A many placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pl
'The woman cleared many yards.'
The cross-reference markers for 0 provide syntactic evidence that the
nominal lurni 'weed' is part of the verbal complex and not an 0 argument.
Given that there are complex verbal phrases in the language, it may be
possible to interpret one of the arguments of a di-transitive verb as a nominal
within the verb phrase rather than a syntactic argument. Consider an example
with a di-transitive verb such as ikwar 'give':
(5.44) ka
abi lu
ikwari
lSgA 3Sg0 thingO give Sg/DualO-Pf
'I gave him something.'
(5.45) ka
abi lu
nakwari
lSgA 3Sg0 thingO 3n SgO-give sg/ dualO-Pf
'I gave him two things.'
(cross-reference marking to the inanimate 0 argument lu 'thing')
(5.46) ka
yabi lu
na- kwarda
lSgA 3n SgO thingO 3n Sg-give Sg/DualO-PfFl
'I gave them something.'
(cross-reference marking to the animate 0 argument yabi '3n SgO')188As either of the nonA nominals can be cross-referenced on the verb (5.45
and 5.46), one must assume that both nominals are syntactic arguments of the
verb with the specification that only one of the arguments can be cross-referenced
at any one time on the verb. More examples need to be collected with (di)transitive verbs to prove this.
A couple of transitive verbs have been collected where the nominal can
either be part of the verb complex or a syntactic argument:
(5.47) ka
mara mir
asr- i
1SgA 2SgGen wordO hear-Pf
'I heard your message.'
ditkiri(i)
(5.48) ka lar- ira gepi
1SgA fish-Gen scalesO peel,scrape-Pf
'I scaled the fish.'
mari mir n(a)asr- i
(5.49) ka
1SgA 2Sg0 word 1/2Sg0-hear-Pf
'I heard you (talking).'
(5.50) ka kumala
gegur ditkiri(i)
1SgA sweet potatoO peel peel,scrape-Pf
'I peeled the sweet potato.'
It is unclear what the semantic distinction is between the two types. One
possibility may be that the nominal incorporated into the verbal phrase (5.49 and
5.50) is indefinite whilst the non-incorporated nominal (5.47 and 5.48) is definite.
An alternative explanation would be that the incorporated nominal focusses on
the activity itself whilst the non-incorporated nominal focusses on an end-point,
a purpose. Note, however, that for many verbs, there is no choice.
There are examples of lexicalised complex verb phrases, that is where the
noun is an inseparable part of the verb phrase and its meaning. Examples of
lexicalised complex verb phrases include for intransitive verbs: i ezo 'cry'
(<tearN, shed?), erer ekri 'shout, squawk' (<shoutN, emit?), segur etker 'play'
(<playN, ?), kobek esi 'cough' (<coughN, bang down upon waves), and for
transitive verbs: upi diti 'help' (<tail?,?), lag dasur 'smell' (<smellN, ?), tag
digwat 'shake hands' (<hand, pull), op dipit 'meet' (<face, hit?), tep diskir 'taste'
(<skin of fruit, activity to do with mouth?).
Within complex verbal phrases, a nominal can always be isolated from the
verbal component because verbal inflections occur only on the verb, not on the
nominal, and the nominal can always occur as an independent lexeme. It seems
that the generalization is as follows: at one end of the continuum, there are
nominals functioning as syntactic arguments of the verb and at the other end of
the continuum, there are nominals within verbal phrases forming an essential
part of the verb phrase's meaning. In between these two extremes, there are189some verbs which allow both types to occur and these are exploited for various
stylistic purposes.

5.4The Noun Complex.
The structure of a noun complex is as follows:Determiner-N[modifier]Adjective
lNoun-GenlN[head]- giz 'Pl'
·(iba-ibi 'n Sg') £N-kem 'Ass'
N-ey 'Dual'l(5.51)[able mitkar epey ] pe da-ramar
Det many baskets Deix I -3n SgS- I PIS be resting upon
'The many baskets are there (resting upon something).'
(5.52) [able kebi bam+bam nar ] pe ikase
Det little tumeric Adj boats Deix be going along
'The little yellow van is going by.'
(5.53) lim-ira bi
sun-Gen light
'sunlight'
Case inflections are suffixed to the head or clitic immediately following the
head, i.e. giz, iba-ibi. Genitive nouns follow the order with the possessor (the
modifier) preceding the possessed (the head).
The plural marker -giz(e) always directly follows the noun which it
modifies:
(5.54) gayr legize kari natager-da
alot person-PIA lSgO 1/2Sg0-tell- P£Pl
'Alot of people told me.'
The marker -giz(e) behaves like inflections, which are always suffixed to the
noun. It can be regarded as a post-clitic since it forms a single phonological unit
with the noun, i.e. there is a single pitch-accent, e.g. netat le '1 person', gayr le-giz
'many people'.
Not included in the structure of the noun complex outlined above are
locational adjuncts often involving a nominal and a locational noun acting like a
kind of postposition. Both are inflected for case:
(5.55) ka [pon- ge muy- ge] nazirkedi
lSgS <Eng-Loe inside-Loe 1/2Sg/PlS-Sg/DualS be inside-Pr
'I was inside the phone box.'","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"
"1.418In this study, the syllable has been arbitrarily selected as corresponding tothe following types. A syllable must minimally consist of a vowel:
V
o 'liver' VG aw 'big'
GV wi '3n Sg' GVG
way 'coconut seed'
CV pi 'dust' CVG pew 'wing' CGV Pyu name CGVG syaw 'sneeze'
VC op 'face' VGC Awm name GVC wir 'coal' GVGC ways 'take Fut3'
CVC pit 'nose' CVGClayp 'ear'
CGVCnyap 'thirst'CGVGC (no examples)
Some elaboration is required. The glides, at least with regard to the syllable
structure, need to be distinguished from consonants as glides can occur with
consonants in a word-initial and word-final cluster whereas a consonant cluster
(i.e. with no glides) is not possible in these positions. Consequently, I have
chosen to treat them as a distinct class in order to preserve phonotactic
generalizations. However, note that glides and consonants share features as one
would expect and it is sometimes arbitrary to label a sound sequence such as pew
'wing, flipper' of the type CVG rather than CVC. For reasons given above, the
distinction is best maintained. Any phonemic sequence that is longer than the
sequences listed is regarded as non-monosyllabic. Consider, for example:
way.su 'vagina'
ma.yu 'golden trevally'
mwey.ni 'woven mat for scooping things'
mak.rem - ma.krem 'unmarried male'
kim.yar - ki.myar 'married male'
i.k6s 'spear (verb)'
is.mi - i.smi 'cut Sg/DualO'
It is sometimes difficult to determine where the boundary lies between twosyllables. In such instances, ambisyllabicity must be assigned. This is the case
when there is a consonant cluster of two consonants or a consonant plus glide.
When there is a glide and consonant cluster, the glide is assigned to the previous
syllable and the consonant to the following syllable. H there is a single consonant
or glide, then it is typically perce·1ved as belonging to the syllable following.
In addition, affixed morphemes affect the type of syllable structure
permitted. To illustrate, consider the following sequence /ks/ found in sek+sek
'wrong, bad' (from the reduplicated form sek?). Compare this to the verb iski
'spear Pf' which is derived from the root ikos suffixed with the perfective
marker -i triggering final vowel deletion (parallel to the verb dirpi 'sweep '\'f '
derived from the verb root dirup). Thus, reduplication allows different
consonant clusters to those found at oiher morpheme boundaries.
1.5.1 Phonotactics.
The phonotactic structure of the language may be very generally stated as
follows. All single consonants, vowels or glides, can occur in word-initial and
final position except /rl, which cannot occur word-initially (see discussion below).","[29, 30]"

These are the only examples collected of this type suggesting a semiproductive process. It could be more appropriate to list them directly in the
lexicon as compound lexemes.
Comparison with Adjectives.
It was mentioned in the introduction that compounds, be they listed as
lexemes or produced through a productive process, share comparable and
diverging features with adjectives.
Similarities between these two groups have been alluded to above. It was
seen that the compound types frequently exhibit the pattern in which Nl
provides more information about N2. Adjectives which precede the noun they
modify fulfil a similar function because they too provide additional information
about the referent of the noun. In formal terms, the Nl of a compound and
adjectives both precede the head noun and both fulfil a modifier-type function.
However, most adjectives are derived from nouns by a process of
reduplication whereas nouns in a compound structure do not undergo such a
derivational process (see the section on Adjectives, p75).
There are a number of examples in the data which contrast a modifying
noun and a modifying adjective. Consider:

(2.234) ut+ut

'overripe mango'
(i.e. one which has been lying on the ground for several days)
Semantic differences between the two types are not easily captured.
Wierzbicka (1988) when discussing differences between nouns and adjectives
makes the claim that nouns 'identify a certain kind of person, a kind of thing, a
kind of animal (Ibid; 469) ...endowed with certain properties; whereas adjectives
designate properties as such (and more specifically what is seen as) a single
property' (Ibid; 472). Whilst her explanation has been formulated to capture
differences between independent nouns and adjectives, it does seem that her
comments are pertinent to the differences between a modifying noun in a
compound and an adjective. In compounds, the first noun often provides
information which identifies the kind of referent it is, whereas adjectives provide
information concerning a particular property of the referent.
Givon (1984; 51) in his account of the differences between independent
nouns and adjectives provides a semantic explanation which seems to partly
capture the difference between modifying nouns and adjectives. His claim is that
nouns refer to the most stable conditions, adjectives to intermediate states (as
opposed to verbs which are events of most rapid change). With compounds, the
modifying noun often refers to a permanent and inherent quality of the head
noun, whereas with adjectives, it is often an impermanent quality and often the
result of a process.
Neither approach satisfactorily distinguishes between modifying nouns
and adjectives. However, neither Wierzbicka nor Givon formulated their ideas
in order to account for modifying nouns although features such as 'the kind of
thing' and 'permanence' capture some of the differences. A language which
heavily exploits such a distinction can contribute in refining and modelling these
semantic claims.

to others, e.g. ?kimyar-giz 'men (PIS)'.

Informants have said nalulu is the same as nalu 'what O'. However, the
English gloss might be better captured by 'what kind of X', i.e. what kind of thing
did they get up to yesterday at Dew? What kind of happiness is he feeling? (i.e.
what is the cause?). In other words, nalulu may be the interrogative word used
for asking information about a component of a compound. In order to verify this
claim, questions need to be elicited of the type:
What kind of hair does he have?
What type of house does he live in?
What kind of bananas do you grow? etc.
2.4Adjectives.
The class of adjectives is somewhat problematic in terms of isolating its
members and determining what are its characteristics. The following words are
tentatively classed as adjectives: aw 'big, old', kebi 'little, young', debe 'good',
adud 'bad'. Also included in the adjective word class are the determiner/
demonstrative and quantifier words: able-ale 'determiner I demonstrative', netat
'one', nerut 'another', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several', mitkar 'alot',
gayr 'many'.
Criteria used for determining class membership is not based so much on
what they are as on what they are not. These words typically occur in a modifier
function (although they sometimes can occur as nouns). All words functioning
as adjectives precede the noun they modify or directly precede the existential/
locational verb:75(2.278) able kebi werem i ezo- Ii
Det little childS tear shed-Prlmpf
'The little boy is crying.'
(2.279) debe lag+lag
good want
'Nice flavour.'
(2.280) debe le

(2.281) wader koskir
several (married)female
'several women'
(2.282) nole ko
adud ike
Neg again bad n PIS be(thing)
'It does not matter.'
(lit: it is not bad (here) either)
Examples have been collected where adjectives are being used with a degree
function:
(2.283) e
aw-kaka kebi werem daIi
3SgS big-Intens little child n PIS be(person)-Primpf
'He is a very small child.'
In the above example, aw 'big' is not functioning as an adjective but as a
modifier of the adjective kebi 'little' to intensify it. (It would be pertinent to see
whether it can occur without the intensifier, e.g. ?e aw kebi werem dfili 'He is
slightly younger.')
In the two examples below (2.284 and 2.285), the reduplicated form is being
used with a distributive function:
(2.284) wi
netat+netat taba agud-em erer ba- krier
3n SgS one
3Gen god-. All shout PIS-cry out-n Prlmpf
'They cried out one by one to their god/They each cried out to their god.'

Det crews 3Gen one
Intr-tell- PWl
'The sailors said to each other.. .'
(Both of the above examples are from the manuscript of a biblical translation of
Jonah.)
Most words functioning as adjectives are derived from the noun word class
through a process of reduplication. Using Dixon's semantic types of adjectives
(1982), the following words in adjective function occur:761) dimension:
piri+piri 'long'
tewpay 'short'<piri 'length'
<tewpay 'shortness'
ex. tewpay-em 'for a short while'
<deg 'width'
<dob 'fatness'
<?toyrdeg+deg 'wide'
d6b+dob 'fat'
-toyr+toyr 'fat'
2) physical properties:

urweri(+urweri) 'hot'

kurap+kurap 'bitter'
<kurab 'bitterness'
neru+neru 'sweet'
<neru 'sugarcane'
3) colour:
goli+goli 'dark'
<goli 'squid sp.'
za(r)zer+za(r)zer 'white'
<zarzer 'whiteness'
mamam+mamam 'red'
<mam 'blood'
bam+bam 'yellow'
<barn 'turmeric'
4) human propensity:
serer+serer 'happy'
<serer 'happiness'
pardar+pardar 'clever'
<pardar 'wisdom'
5) age:
peret 'old (of thing)'
<?emeret 'ancient time'
6) value:
<?sek 'badness'
sek+sek 'bad'
<sek 'badness' + kak 'privative'?
sikak 'okay, well'
parko+parko 'imperfect'
<parko 'defect'
7) speed:
<dudum 'haste'
dudum+dudum 'quick'
korider+korider 'fast'
<korider 'speed'
wapum+wapum 'slow'
<?wapum 'slowness'
Several items functioning as adjectives are homophonous in form with
nouns. Should these simply be labelled 'nominals'? In such cases, there is no
morphological or syntactic evidence to suggest that there is any derivation
involved and thus, there is no justification for two word classes.
It remains to be checked whether the reduplicated form is possible at all
and/ or whether it intensifies its meaning:
?e tewpay+tewpay le 'he (is) a very short person'77?peret+peret wali 'very old clothes'
There are also some examples where the adjective can occur either
reduplicated or not (see also section on comparison with nominal compounds
p65):
(2.286) urweri ni
heat
water
'hot water, tea'
(2.287) aw-kaka urweri+urweri gerger pe ike
big-Intens heat Adj
dayS Deix n PIS be(thing)
'It is a really hot day today.'

overboard.'
(from the manuscript of the bible translation of Jonah)
(2.289) aw beber+beber werem daIi
big heavy Adj childS n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a very heavy child.'
The reader can note that the reduplicated form is associated with an
intensified meaning. It is not possible to say whether this meaning is obtained
from an adverbial function or a meaning that can be attributed to the
reduplicated form of the adjective. As this hypothesis was not considered during
fieldwork, no examples have been elicited to test it. The reduplicated form needs
to be tested for an attenuative meaning as well. The examples demonstrate the
possibility that reduplication can also be a semantic device.
Rigsby (p.c) suggests that the reduplicated form has a proprietive meaning
and gives as an example:
(2.290) tulik+tulik le
knife
person
'person with a knife'
No such examples were collected with the current corpus of data so no
comment can be made. However, there are examples where the associative case
has a proprietive meaning:
(2.291) mir- kem le
word-Ass person
'preacher' (lit: word-having person) (cf. 2.129)
(2.292) ged- kem le
land-Ass person
'land owner' (lit: land-having person) (cf. 2.130)78Of course, it may be that reduplication and the use of the associative suffixhave a general proprietive meaning with slight semantic differences between the
two.
There is one example in the data where a proprietive meaning is the only
interpretation possible and yet there is no reduplicated form nor the presence of
the associative suffix:
(2.293) ese ka no
if lSgS Restr
aw bakir le
wan(a)aIi...
big stone person RemPast-1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'H only I had had a lot of money.. .'
It would seem on the basis of the above example that a proprietive
meaning cannot be the sole function of the reduplicated form.
Some words always occur in a reduplicated form when functioning as
adjectives. Such is the case with colour terms, e.g. bam+bam 'yellow', where
reduplication is a signal of its function, i.e. a syntactic device, to mark a
derivational process. The two uses of reduplication are not necessarily
incompatible and there may be instances where syntactic uses and semantics
converge. More data will have to be collected to test such a claim.
Is there a basis for postulating a distinct word class of adjectives? For at
least a small closed class of words whose function is primarily to modify nouns,
an adjective category is appropriate. For other words operating in this function,
one can simply specify that they are nominals which for some will be
reduplicated to mark their adjectival function and for others, to mark intensity.","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"
"44• whether this construction can occur with other case inflections.
There are morphophonological alternations with the associative suffix:
-ipkem-> -ypkem I Vex. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers'
I yex. ?Oy-ypkem 'in front of Oy'
-ipkem I elsewhere ex. Lez-ipkem 'in front of Les'
2.2.2 Syntactic versus Non-Syntactic Cases.
Criteria for distinguishing between syntactic and non-syntactic cases can be
established through the cross-reference markers on the verb. Arguments which
can be cross-referenced are: A, S and 0. The genitive may optionally be crossreferenced on the verb. Examples to illustrate cross-reference marking follow:
- cross-reference marking for S:1-----1
able neys werem ut
miwperedi
Det two childS sleepN 3n SgS-n PIS be lying-Prlmpf
'The two children are lying asleep.'
- cross-referencing for A (by a suffix):
(2.87)1------------------------1(2.88)wiable lu
erapeydarda
3n SgA Det thingO buy Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
'They bought the thing.'
- cross-referencing for 0 (by a prefix and suffix):
e
yabi
natakerda
3SgA 3n SgO 3n SgO-gather Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
'He gathered them (mangoes) up.'
- optional cross-referencing to genitive:
(2.89)1------,abra
werem (d)- ewsmeda
3SgGen childS 3Gen- Sg/DualS born-PfSg
'His child is/was born.'
*werem dewsmeda
(Note the above ungrammatical example when the verb is cross-referenced for an
absent genitive argument.)
The cross-reference markers permit a distinction to be drawn between the
cases as follows:(2.90)45Non-Syntactic:
Locative
Allative
Ablative
Instrumental
Associative
(Genitive)
The genitive can be listed in both categories as it can optionally be crossreferenced, it only occurs with 3rd person genitive and it is used mostly to
disambiguate the lack of coreference between a possessor of 0 and A or the
possessor of an incorporated nominal and S (see the section 3.6 p95 on Genitive
Marker for 3rd Person).

(Genitive)2.2.3 Other Inflectional Affixes.
1)
The nonsingular suffix -iba/-ibi is added to a singular noun in a complex
phrase to indicate that it is a member of a group of two or more. For example:
(2.91) kari
omay-iba mari omay-ey wi
ba- regley
1SgGen dog- n Sg 2SgGen dog- Dual 3n SgS Intr-bite flesh-nPrlmpfDual
'My dog and your dog, they bit each other.'
(2.92) wi
Sigar-iba nardar-dare omaskir-kem
3n SgA S.n Sg 3n SgO-see- Pauc children-Ass
'They saw Sigar along with his children.'
(?They, Sigar and his children, got seen.)
As exemplified in the two sentences given above (2.91 and 2.92), -iba
merely indicates one of a group of two or more. There are no instances of this
suffix occurring with inanimate nouns. Could this be because speakers are less
interested in number reference with inanimates? Typically, with inanimate
objects, the nouns are simply juxtaposed:
(2.93) e
tabara sarik kep- kem giz- ge irmi
3SgA 3Gen bow arrow-Ass trunk-Loe stick Pauc/PlO into-Pf
'He stuck his bow along with his arrow into the base of the tree.'
(Dewmer, p209, sections)
There is one example (2.94.) collected with -iba suffixed onto an inanimate
noun but it is an example collected through elicitation and the genitive case is
used within the complex phrase, a feature which is not normally permitted:
(2.94) ?ma kara
sogob- iba masis-ey narapey0
2SgA 1SgGen ciggies-n Sg <Eng- Dual 3n SgO-buy Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
'Buy my cigarettes and matches.'
The -iba suffix has been classified as an inflection for the following reasons:46•
The apparent restriction against the genitive case co-occurring with it in its
full form (excluding the example just given above). This is a restriction parallel
to that for inflections:
(2.95) taba koskiriba omasker-kem
3Gen (married)female-n Sg children- Ass
'his wife along with his children'
(2.96) *taba-ra koskir-iba omasker-kem
Gen
•
A distinction in the form when affixed to a noun in a non-syntactic case,
namely -ibi. Thus, there are basically two forms for this affix: -iba for syntactic
cases and -ibi for non-syntactic cases. Here are some examples with the form -ibi:
(2.97) ka bakyamu- da Sigar-ibi uteb- em omasker-kem
lSgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg S.n Sg place-All children-Ass
'I went to Sigar and his children's place.'
(Note that in the above example 2.97, the -ibi phrase seems to be in a genitive case
function which could be interpreted as evidence of the genitive's fluid status as a
syntactic or non-syntactic case.)
(2.98) ... pa- ka ta- ba Irwered-ge Mesnare-ybi- (i)m Eydyana-ey
Loe M.n Sg-All E. Dual
Deix-lsgS Deix-go I.da-rabger-i
I -3n Sg0-1 call- Pf
' ... and then, I came to Irwered, to Mesnare and Eydyana's and invited
them.'
(2.99) Bewr pe eypu- ge irdi
Webok-ibi- lam a
Babud-ey
B. S Deix middle-Loe n PIS be(place) W.n Sg-Abl Conj B.Dual
'Bewr is half-way between Webok and Badud.'
There is no distinction between the A, S or 0 argument when the
nonsingular inflection is affixed. Thus, one can use this suffix with an A
argument (2.100) or with an S argument (2.101):
ey lewer ti- dikasr-eyey
(2.100) Lez-iba koskirL. - n Sg (married)female-Dual foodO Deix-cook- PrlmpfDual
'Les and his wife are cooking (there).'
(2.101) Lez-iba koskerey ta- bakyamu- daryey
L.- n Sg (married)female-Dual Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'Les and his wife came.'
There is some ambiguity caused by this lack of distinction. With an
intransitive verb, there will only be one core argument so the -iba phrase will
have to be S. With a transitive verb, the non-iba phrase will either have an overt
ergative case marker for A or it will be marked overtly for 0 if it is a pronoun or a
proper noun. The only instance where it will be ambiguous is when a common
noun is the 0 as this will be the -0 case marker with no way of distinguishing 0
47from A. Of course, word order can always be used to disambiguate. Here is an
example where the overt 0 case marker on the personal pronoun allows the
addressee to interpret the -iba phrase as the A:
(2.102) neti- (i)ba yabi nerwer-da?
who-n Sg 3n Sg 3n Sg0-teach-P£Pl
'Who(pl) taught them?'
There is some diachronic and synchronic evidence which suggests that the
suffix -iba is related to the pronominal plural genitive case form (see section 2.3
p68 on Pronouns for more details). The nonsingular genitive pronominal forms
which are relevant to this discussion are:
1n Sg Exel keriba
Incl meriba
2n Sg
waba
3n Sg
wiyaba I yaba
The nonsingular forms which all end in -(i)ba correspond closely in form
as well as in function to the nominal nonsingular affix -iba.
In addition, Ray in his study (1893) gives the following examples to indicate
a pair or a group:
(2.103) keriba
Pasi-ey bakyamuley
Dawar-em
1n SgExclGen P.- Dual Sg/DualS go-PastDual D.All
'We (exd dual), Passi and I, went to Dawar.'(lbid; 61)
(the glosses are my own)
(2.104) mi
merbitkem namrida
1n Sglnd ln SglndO-Ass
1/2Sg?-Sg/DualS sit down-PfSg
'We sat down in one another's company/You sat down along with us.'(?)
(Ibid; 64)
Although there are no examples in Ray's data of this construction being
used with nominals such as those given for modern Meryam Mir, the reader
should note that in at least one of Ray's examples, the plural genitive pronoun is
used to indicate the plural pair. This parallels the examples found in the presentday language where the -iba is affixed to nominals for similar effect.
The earlier Meryam Mir examples both differ and resemble modern
Meryam Mir with regard to pronominals. Like the earlier form of the language, a
nonsingular pronoun is required in this construction:
(2.105) ki
ama- ey bakyamu- daryey
1n SgExdS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'We two, mother and I, went.'
(2.106) wi
ama- ypkem namreder
3n SgS mother-Ass
3n SgS-Pauc/PlS be seated-n Prlmpf
'They were seated, him along with the mothers.'
Note that if there is possession, it must be with the reduced form:48(2.107) kikerbi
ama- yey
ln SgExclS ln SgExdGen mother-Dual
'we two, our mother and I'
* ki kara amayey
lSgGen
* ki keriba
amayey
ln SgExclGen
* keriba amayey
'we two, mother and I'2)
The privative suffix -kak is added to (pro)nominals to indicate the absence
or the lack of something:
(2.108) e
barkak mir dike
3SgS crookedN-Priv word n PIS be(word)
'That is the right word.'
(lit: it is a word without crookedness)
(2.109) e
sirib- kak werem daIi
3SgS shame-Priv child n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a shameless child.'
(2.110) ka nole utkak n(a)- aIi
lSgS Neg sleepN-Priv 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'I am not sleepy.'
(lit: I am without sleep)
It can be used with pronouns or animate nouns as well to denote their
absence at a particular place:
(2.111) nole abi- tkak meta- ge irdiredi
Neg 3Sg0-Priv house-Loe n SgS be(place)-Pr
'He was not there at the house.'
(lit: There/It is without him at the house)
When it occurs within a noun phrase, it must precede the head noun and
the stem will operate in an adjectival or attributive function. As such, it might be
considered a derivation. For example:
ide abi epIi
(2.112) able mir- kak newrDet word-Priv unmarried female-A 3Sg0 carry Sg/DualO-Primpf
'The quiet silent girl is carrying him.'
Nominalised verbs can also be used with this affix:
a
bab
(2.113) ese ma aspir- kak apu
if 2SgS marryN-Priv mother Conj father
ma n(a)- aIi...
2SgS 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'If you are an unmarrried mother or father .. .'","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
"28CHAPTER TWO
NOMINALS
In this chapter, the different parts of speech will be briefly examined beforelooking at nominals.
2.1Parts of Speech.
The following parts of speech need to be distinguished:
Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
Pronouns
Adverbs
Deictic Markers
Clause Relators
Exclamations/Interjections
Nouns.
Nouns are an open word class including both concrete or abstract nouns.
Concepts such as hunger, thirst, fatness and width are expressed in the language
as nouns; for example, 6mar 'good feeling', weku 'anger', werer 'hunger', nyap
'thirst', dob 'fatness', deg 'width', piri 'height', new 'ripeness, blister', kiris
'rawness'. This class of words is inflected for case through suffixes. Within this
class, a distinction needs to be drawn between common nouns, which inflect by
distinguishing A from S/O,and proper nouns, which inflect differently for all
three cases. There are many compound nouns formed with either two nouns,
e.g. kerim le 'boss' (kerim 'head' and le 'person'), or a nominalized verb and
noun, e.g. aro+aro tup 'sardines' (< ero 'eat'+ tup 'sardine').
Verbs.
Verbs are an open class of words which refer to either states, e.g. ut ipe 'be
asleep', processes, e.g. esk 'flow', edug 'burn', or events, e.g. ewmi 'die', ero 'eat'.
The verb has inflections carrying aspectual/ temporal information as well as
number /person agreement cross-referencing syntactic arguments. These markers
provide the formal characteristics that permit verbs to be categorised into two
classes. These two classes,, have some semantic correlation dividing atelic
statives from telic process verbs although class membership can be purely formal.
For example, an event such as ikase 'go along' is classified, at least
morphologicall~ as an intransitive atelic stative verb, i.e. 'be going along'.","[39, 40]"
"5.5.1 Interrogatives.
There are two types of interrogatives in the language. One type for polar
questions and another type for non-polar questions.
Polar questions have the same form as declaratives but with rising
intonation at the end of the utterance to indicate a question:
(S.64) ma- y
kari-m paret dirup- o?
2SgA-Deix lSg- All dirt sweep-Fut2/3
'Will you sweep for me?'
(S.65) ma suga
dikri- o?
2SgA <EngO throw-Fut2/3
'Have you put in sugar?
Non-polar questions require an interrogative pronoun or clitic inserted at
the beginning of the utterance. The form of the interrogative depends on what is
being questioned (see the section on Interrogative Pronouns, p72). Although
these typically occur at the beginning, they can follow a pronoun:
(S.66) ma nalu ike-li?
2SgA whatO do- Prlmpf
'What are you doing?'
192The attention getting particle aka 'hey!' is often inserted at the beginning
of an utterance such as a question to attract the addressee's attention:
(5.67) (aka) ma- y
idimge bakyamu- 0
awgog- em?
hey 2SgS-Deix morning-Loe Sg/DualS go-Fut2/3 big climb-All
'(Hey,) are you going up to the top of the hill tomorrow?
(5.68) aka ka ge- ka ut
na- ydilu
able uteb- ge?
hey lSgS Deix-lSgS sleep Futl-n PIS lie down-FutlSg Det place-Loe
'Hey, will I sleep here at this place?
There is a particle -aw which is cliticised onto the last word in the sentence.
It operates like a tag question asking for confirmation or just checking to see
whether the speaker has the addressee's attention:
(5.69) ma kcira mir asor- 0aw?
2SgA lSgGen word listen-Fut2/3-tag
'You will listen to what I am saying, won't you?'
(5.70) e
no teb+teb
baka-aw?
3SgS Restr alone Adj go- tag
'He went on his own, didn't he?'
There is also a vocative suffix -oy affixed to a proper noun when the person
being addressed is distant or non-visible. When the person is close-by, no marker
is used:
(5.71) Kosir-oy 'hey Kosir!'
Warib-oy 'hey W arib!'
Eydyana-oy 'hey Eidiana!'
?Pomoy-oy 'hey Pomoy!'
Examples need to be collected to see whether this suffix can be used when
kinship terms or common nouns are used for address forms:
?ama-oy
'hey mother!'
?berbet-oy 'hey sibling!'
?nap-oy
'hey grandchild!'
?kerim le-oy 'hey boss!'
It can also be used with interrogative pronouns where the forms will differ
depending on whether what is being questioned is animate (-oy) or inanimate
(-ay): e.g. nete-oy 'who?'; nalu(w)-ay 'what?'
l
i.I'5.5.2 Imperatives.
As we saw earlier in the section on temporal/ aspectual morphology, there
is no distinction between the future and the imperative for 2nd person. The
same form of the verb is used for both functions. However, the pronoun can be
omitted when it is being used with an imperative function:193(5.72)wapum+wapum ero-0
slow Intens?
eat-Fut2/3
'Eat slowly.'
(5.73) able
erw-am
Det N? eat- Fut2/3Dual
'Eat this (you two).'
When it is a negative imperative, the verb can be used in its nominal form
with the privative suffix:
(5.74) nole ero-0
nole aro- kak
Neg eat-Fut2/3
Neg eatN-Priv
'Don't eat it.'
Note, however, that the privative nominal is actually ambiguous for the
utterance could be interpreted as '(It's) inedible' although there is a different
intonation for each.
5.5.3 Reported Speech.
No examples of indirect speech have been collected in the data despite the
fact that there are some 150 pages of texts. The most common strategy is to report
speech directly. A complement kega can optionally be used to introduce the
speech act. It may be related to the following deictic markers: ke(y) 'in this
manner, way' + ga 'and then, and also there':
(5.75) able narbitgize abi detagr-ey
kega:
Det elder sibling-PIA 3Sg0 tellPastDual Quot

2SgA-Deix Det castawayO hit- Fut2/3

(Dewmer, p212, section19)

'Irwam came (and) stood up at the same place as her, in the water. He
asked her: ""Hey, what are you?"" Dew said to him: ""!am a person."" Dew
asked him in tum: ""Are you a person (or) are you a ghost?"" Irwam said
to her: ""! am a person.""'
5.6Negation.
The negation particle nole - ne (these are in free variation) 'not, no' must
precede the verb and typically occurs following the first accented element in the
utterance to negate an event:
(5.77) wi
kikem-ge
3n SgS first- Loe
le
nole umer-kak da-r(a)a
Neg know-Priv I -3n SgS-1 n PIS be(person)-PrlmpfPauc
'They did not know at first.' (Dewmer, p213, section28)
(5.78) e
ne tabra mamorser tabra bud itkiri op- ge
3SgA Neg 3Gen properly 3Gen mudO wipe off-Pf face-Loe
'She did not properly wipe off the mud on her face.'
(5.79) ma nole abi dip0
2SgA Neg 3Sg0 dob in- Fut2/3
'Don't dob him in.'
The negation particle can sometimes occur at the beginning of a clause
which is intonationally dependent on the preceding clause:
(5.80) wi
sikak we- ge akarik-ley,
3n SgS okay beach-Loe land- PastDual
nole lelut yabi
nardar-i
Neg person-SgA 3n SgO 3n SgO-see- Pf
'They (2) landed on the beach, allright, no-one saw them.'
(Dewmer, p209, section7)
5.7Valency Changes.
In the section on the intransitiviser ba-, the prefix was shown to make
transitive verbs intransitive either by making the A the S argument as it is
reflexive, or by making the 0 the S argument of the intransitivised verb. This
process is exploited in the language for a number of So/listic effects.
The intransitiviser can be used with events affecting inalienable body parts
where the Sis reflexive and the non-S argument, if there is one, is either
interpreted as a non-syntactic argument or as part of the verb phrase:195(5.81)·,
Iimus ba- tu- Ii
lSgS beard Intr-shave-Primpf
'I am shaving myself.' (lit: I am beard-shaving)
(5.82) Gamalay ba- trimurik-li
G.S
lntr-stretch- Primpf
'Gamalay is stretching.'
Contrast 5.81 with 5.83 and 5.82 with 5.84:
(5.83) Lez-ide tabara imus itw- i
L.- A 3Gen beardO shave-Pf
'Les shaved his beard.'
(5.84) ka netat teter erapeyda, ka netat teter itrimurik-da
lSgA one footO break Sg/DualO-PfSg lSgA one footO stretch- PfSg
'I have one leg folded, I have one leg stretched out.'
A much larger corpus of data is required to establish what the meaning
difference is between using the transitive and the intransitive forms. To date,
only events involving body parts have been collected with this kind of case frame
and one could hypothesize that there is a preference for these types to be treated
in this way because an intransitivised verb allows the 0 to be expressed within
the verb phrase, making it parallel in form and function to reflexive
constructions.
There is an innovation in the use of the intransitiviser bai which is
sometimes being used for events that are not necessarily reflexive, but rather
because the same pronominal free form is used. As was seen earlier, the same
pronominal forms can be used for the reflexive, i.e. oneself, as well as the
exclusive meaning, i.e. by oneself:
(5.85) ka imus itw- i kababu
lSgA beardO shave-Pf Exel
'I shaved my beard by myself.'
(5.86) ka kababu imus ba- twi
lSgS lSgRefl beard Intr-shave-Pf
'I shaved myself.'
However, speakers are sometimes making the verb intransitive when it is
the intensive pronominal function:
(5.87) ma
mabu
ba- smer-0
2SgA/S Refl/Excl lntr-see- Fut2/3
'See yourself - See for yourself.'
Thus, the presence of the intransitiviser morpheme doe.6 not,in such
instances) , indicate a reflexive action.It is the result of the pronominal free
form, marking a reflexive action (i.e. 5=0) and/or an exclusive meaning (i.e.
nonsyntactic).
ka1965.8Periphrastic Constructions.
Inchoative and causative events are typically expressed periphrastically.
Causative constructions have two verbs: the causing event and the resulting
change of state. Inchoative constructions also have two verbs: an intransitive
activity type verb and the resulting change of state. Let us examine each type in
turn.
The verbs ikay 'make Sg/DualO' and iker 'make Pauc/PlO' express the
causal part of the event with the A acting upon the 0, and the inchoative verb
expresses the result with the 0 of 'cause' usually the S of 'become' (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.88) wi
nakerda
3n SgA 3n SgO-make Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
tewpay mir berda
short word pauc/ plS become-perfpl
'They have made the words become short.'
(5.89) kaba- yde abi ikayda ekesmu- da
banana-A 3Sg0 make Sg/DualO-PfSg split intr.-PfSg
'The banana (tree) has made it (the pipe) split.'
(5.90) Lez-ide bakir ikayda lawlaw bayda
L.- A stoneO make Sg/DualO-PfSg tableS Sg/DualS become-PfSg
'Les made a table out of a stone/ Les made the stone into a table.'
Causal verbs can occur outside causative constructions meaning 'tell' (with
'word' incorporated into the verb complex) and 'swive' (with the paucal/plural
form of the verb being used which could be an idiomatic use)':
(5.91) kimyaride taba koskir
mir ikay-da
married man-A 3Gen married femaleO word tell- PfSg
aw mir+mir koskir
daIi
big word Adj married female n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'The husband told his wife. She is a big talker.'
(5.92) ka mad naker- e
1SgA 2Sg0 Fut1+1/2Sg0-swive-Fut1
'I will swi ve you.'
With inchoative events, there is a clear preference to express it as a
complex event involving an intransitive activity type verb with an S argument
(akay 'Sg/DualS do' and eker 'do') and the inchoative verb (bay 'Sg/DualS
become' and ber 'Pauc/PlS become'). Here are some examples:
(5.93) e
akayda kimyar bayda
3SgS Sg/DualS do-PfSg man
Sg/DualS become-PfSg
'He has become a man.'
...Je kimyar bay-da197(5.94)ege epigeme-lu
3SgS-Deix change- PastSg

Sg/DualS do-PastSg stoneS/0/0? Sg/DualS become-PastSg
'She then changed, turned into a stone.' (D6pem, p218, section25)
(5.95) ese gur w- akay0

sea-Intens-All Fut3-Sg/DualS become-Fut2/3
maykeaw wag
close big wind
'If the sea turns a deep sea colour (i.e. murky), a big wind (is) nearby.'
Although little can be said about the precise meaning of the intransitive
verbs 'do', it can be pointed out that these verbs are used to mark the inception of
a process and that they always are intransitive with an S argument and the
second nominal, if there is one, being either a non-syntactic argument or part of
the complex verb phrase:
(5.96) ma nole sirib- ge akay0
2SgS Neg shame-Loe Sg/DualS be-Fut2/3
'Do not start to become ashamed.'
(5.97) e
ni
aryem eke-Ii
3SgS water drinkN-All do- Prlmpf
'He is just about to drink.'
(i.e. the glass is pressed against his lips and he is about to drink.)
(5.98) able kimyar
pe able newr
somay-ge eke-Ii
Det married manS Deix Det unmarried female lust- Loe do- Prlmpf
'That man there has started lusting after that girl.'
(Note that the role of the non-S nominal is not understood although it may be
literally: ?That man is doing that girl lust.)
The forms of the inchoative verbs warrant some discussion as well. Note
the resemblance between these forms, i.e. bay, ber, and the causative and
intransitive 'do' forms, i.e. ikay, iker, and, akay, aker. It may be that the forms are
derived from the transitive verb with the intransitiviser ba- although the
transformation also involves an odd change, namely the loss of the initial vowel
and consonant.
5.9Clause Relators.
We saw in the section on deictic markers that these sometimes fulfill a
function parallel to that fulfilled by subordinate (relative) clause markers in other
languages. One of the main differences is the lack of syntactic dependency
between the two clauses although there is often intonational dependency198between the two. In addition, there are several clause relaters which overtly
signal a semantically subordinate relationship between the clause in which they
occur and the main clause. The verb in the subordinate clause, however, has full
inflectional markings, i.e. it is finite. Here are some of the relaters and an
example of each:
temporal clause relaters:

'Flatten it so that it becomes really flat.'
Some of the clause relators have other functions which do not mark a
dependent clause. For example, kewbu can either serve to introduce a temporal
dependent clause meaning 'after' or it can be used as an adverb meaning 'later,
behind':
(5.112) ka na- ba kewbu
lSgS Futl-go later
'I will go later /behind.'
Clause relators can be distinguished from their other functions because
they always occur at the beginning of the clause (except when there is a pronoun
which can precede it).
There is also a co-ordinating conjunction a 'and, or' which can link two
words, phrases or clauses together. This may be a borrowing from English 'and':

A number of the clause relators can combine with each other providing
there is no conflict in meaning. A full description of the relators syntactic and
functional role within the clause or sentence awaits further study.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"

Earlier work on Meryam has been limitgd in quantity and quality. In 1893,
Ray and Haddon published a study of vocabularies and grammatical notes drawn
from various missionaries', explorers' and researchers' notes. Unfortunately, the
study is subject to the contributors' spelling idiosyncracies, e.g. 'Maer' for Mer, to
interpretations of the sort: 'I think the variation of initial vowel is only due to
the influence of individual choice', and to dubious meanings because of personal
beliefs, e.g. omare 'mercy'.
The most extensive study is that of Ray (1907) which provides some 40
pages of grammar, 30 pages of vocabulary and 30 pages of texts. Such a study
provides the opportunity to compare earlier and later forms of the grammar.
A more recent work was undertaken by Bartos (1977), who provides a
preliminary study of the sounds of the language, and a paper by McConvell (1983};
who examines ergativity and verb agreement in the language to demonstrate that
Meryam cannot be said to be fully ergative or accusative in its system.
In addition, there are a number of primary sources such as texts produced
by Meryam students at the School of Australian Linguistics in the newsletter
Ngali and field notes kindly made available by Rigsby.",[14]

3GenA number of generalizations can be made about the structure. The two end
points of the verb stem are positions associated with tense and aspect. Slot 1 in
the structure is a position associated predominantly with 1st and 2nd person.
Within the verb root can be inserted infixes, which are associated exclusively with
3rd person. The last slot of the verb stem carries number information, which is
not necessarily restricted to a particular argument,although it is predominantly
A/S. A couple of examples to illustrate the verb structure follow:
wa- ta- bakyamu- lam

Several comments are needed to understand the overall verb structure.
•
The numbers appearing above each slot indicate the order in which the
morphemes must be affixed. Justification for such ordering will become apparent
when outlining the allomorphic variations.","[99, 100]"
"143mena Adverb 'still, continue'
clause relator 'until, meanwhile'
(3.251) e
mena lewer ero-li
3SgA still foodO eat-Prlmpf
'He is still eating.'
kikem Adverb 'firstly'
clause relator 'before'
(3.252) ka kikem lewer arw-e
lSgA first
foodO Futl-eat-Futl
'I will eat first.'
For some words, it feels intuitively that the adverbial function is primary
with the secondary function having developed from it. Adverbs such as kikem
'firstly', emetu 'already', mena 'still, continue', etc. Unfortunately, there is no
linguistic evidence to either refute or support such a claim.
Although it is not possible to isolate these words as being uniquely or even
primarily an adverb, their function is clearly adverbial. Adverbs contribute
information about the manner:
(3.253) ma taba dudum+dudum
2SgS Deix-go quick
'Come quickly.'
about the time:
(3.254) Geygi, nako aw nyay+nyay daIi?
G.
what big long time n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'Why is Geygi so long (away)?'
about the place:
(3.255) abra
nar ta- ba- ytr- i mayk+mayk Wayer-lam
3SgGen boats Deix-Intr-sink-Pf close
W.Abl
'His boat sank very close to Wayer.'
about the event itself:
(3.256) ...ege emetu ba- yw-i
3SgS-Deix already Intr-dig-Pf
'... (but) he had already buried himself.'
As can be noted from the examples, adverbs covered in this section do not
have any inflections or affixes. (Adverbial phrases do occur as illustrated in the
section on inflections). Their position is relatively free in the sentence although
they tend not to occur in word initial position.
Several of the words used adverbially appear in reduplicated form. This
might be done for two reasons. It may be to derive an adverb from a noun, i.e.
dudum-ge 'in haste' (lit: haste-Loe), dudum+dudum 'quickly'; nyay-em 'forever'
(lit: long time-All), nyay+nyay 'eternally'. Note that since this parallels
reduplicated forms for adjectives, reduplication could be viewed as a syntactic
144process for deriving nouns into modifiers, be they adjectives or adverbs.
However, somewhat similar to adjectives, reduplicated adverbs also imply a
greater intensity, i.e. mayk-e 'dose-by' (lit: close-Loe) versus mayk+mayk 'very
dose-by'. Thus, reduplication is both a syntactic and semantic process for adverbs
as well.","[154, 155, 156]"
"1794.5Status and Grammatical Function of Deictic Markers.
The deictic markers' status is ambiguous. Phonologically, they appear to be
independent words capable of bearing their own pitch-accent. (Pronouns either
get pre or postcliticized onto them):
(4.145) epe ta- bakyamu- da
3SgS-Deix Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
'Then he came.'
(4.146) Kosir pe tabakyamuda
'Kosir then came.'
When they are being used with spatial reference, they often carry stronger
stress marking (evidenced by higher amplitude) which thus adds emphasis:
Determining the deictic markers' position in a sentence is problematic.
There is a tendency for them to occur directly preceding the predicate or
following the first element in the clause, i.e. A/S-deictic-(0)-V, a position itself
frequently associated with clitics. Nonetheless, they frequently occur in a differeni
position although these are always predictable. They sometimes occur in clause
initial position when the A/S is omitted because its identity is already established
(see example 4.149). They sometimes occur following the verb bakyamu-/bakyaw'go'. When the deictic markers follow the verb, they always have the goal
meaning:
(4.147) e
baka ge
3SgSgo Deix
'He went there.'
Their grammatical status makes them clearly dependent as they cannot
occur without a verb:
(4.148) e
nade daIi?
pe daIi
3SgS where n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf Deix n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf
'Where is he? He is there.'*pe
*Npe
Do the deictic markers carry a phoric/ co-referential element in their
meaning and do they have a syntactic role? There are examples where the subject
and deictic marker cannot co-occur within the same clause which suggests that
the markers do indeed carry some kind of phoric/ co-referential element and do
have a syntactic function. Consider:
(4.149) ki
bakyamu- daryey pamas-em able aw lekem
1n SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual shop- All Det big person-Ass
pe kari o- natapert-er
Deix 1Sg0 Fut3-1/2Sg0-growl-n Prlmpf
'I went to the shops with the old man who is always growling me/ I went
to the shops with the old man; the one always growling me.'","[190, 191]"
"When temporal/aspectual/mood/number markers commencing with a
vowel other than /i/ are suffixed to verb roots ending in a high, front vowel /i/,
the root vowel is either reduced to a palatal glide /y/ under certain conditions or
is itself suffixed by a palatal glide when there is a suffix:
1. i -> y I ct
+ V[-i] (C) +
[+accent]
ex. eri 'drink'--> a-ry + e Futl
--> a-ry + ey FutlDual
--> a-ty + e (-a-tiy + e) Futl
--> na-zy + e Futl
--> kab na-ba-ry +er Futln Prlmpfiti 'take out Pauc/PlO'
ner ezi 'rest'
kab eri 'dance'
2. i --> iy I i - + V[-i]
ex. dikri 'sing, throw' ---> d-a-kriy + e Futl
eri 'drink'
--> eriy + eda (- iriy + eda) Prlmp£Pl
ditkuri 'peel'
--> d-a-tkuriy + e Futl
datmi 'follow'
--> d-a-tmiy + e Futl
ati 'suggest Pauc/PlO' --> a-tiy + e Futl
(When the accent is not overtly marked, the reader must assume that it occurs on
the second syllable.)
The rules predicting the forms must be ordered and the second rule102(i.e. i ---> iy) must follow the first. What is being represented is the general rule
that /i/ is reduced to a palatal glide when a morpheme is added. This is similar
to other vowel reductions to glides when there is affixation of a morpheme
commencing with a vowel. There are three environments where it does not
apply and there is an epenthetic glide so that the vowel can retain its syllabicity. It
is blocked when a consonant duster precedes the vowel (CC - + V[-i] ), when the
morpheme added is non-monosyllabic (- + V[-i] C V) and when the vowel is
unaccented (- [-accent] +V[iJ). Note that the apparent free variations in the 1st
person future form ot iti are probably to do with a desire in the production
process to keep the morpheme in a distinct syllable to that of the root.
Consonant Loss or Voicing.
A voiced alveolar stop is deleted when affixed to a verb root ending in a
voiceless alveolar consonant. Voiceless verb root final stops become voiced
before a suffix beginning with a voiced alveolar stop. Rule 1. must be ordered
before Rule 2:
1. I di
> 0 I C[ +alveolar, +voiceless] + ex. etomeret+a 'show Pauc/PlA/O PfPl' (<etomeret + da)
ays+a 'take Pauc/PlO PfPl' (<ays + da)
2. C [-voice] ------> C[ +voice] I - + d
ex. erab+da 'buy Pauc/PlO PfPl' (<erap + da)
barug+da 'happen Pf' (<baruk+da)
Vowel Harmony.
The last vowel of inflected roots undergoes full vowel harmony if it is a
front vowel. The environment in which this happens is before a morpheme
commencing with an initial vowel. This rule must be ordered after the vowel
loss or reduction rule. Note that vowel harmony can also occur across consonant
clusters:
ex. dirup 'sweep' --> derp + er n PrlmpfSg
--> derp + eyey PrlmpfDual
--> derp + eda PrlmpiPl
ex. ewer 'weave' --> iwr + i Pf
--> iwr + iyey PfDual
---> iwr + idare PfPauc
3.8.2 Meaning and Scope of the Tense/Aspect/Mood/Number Prefixes and
Suffixes.
Each tense/ aspect/mood/number category will be examined in some detail
in this section although discussion about number marking will be deferred until
the section on cross-reference markers.","[113, 114]"
"49(from the tape made for Social Security)
The suffix can also be used with nominalised verbs in a negative
imperative:
(2.114) ma nole aro- kak
2SgA Neg eatN-Priv
'Do not eat (it).'
(The above use needs to be tested with nonsingular (pro)nouns to see whether it
is still possible without the usual cross-referencing for number on the verb.)
Morphemes beginning with a voiceless velar stop such as the privative
suffix -kak or the intensifier suffix -kar (see section 4 below p52) devoice the final
consonant of the root if it is a voiced stop:
/b/>p/-+k/d/>t/g/>kkap-kar 'original M.I. dance'
(>kab 'dance' + kar 'intensifier')
tebut-kak 'without friend'
(>tebud 'friend' + kak 'privative')
la(k)-kak 'dislike, not want'
(>lag 'desire, want' + kak 'privative')3)
The semblative suffix -ise is affixed to a (pro)nominal which is the object of
comparison. There are no examples of this affix followed by a case inflection:
eper-da ebur-ise
(2.115) e
3SgS fly- PfSg bird- Smbl
'He flew like a bird.'
lamar koskir
(2.116) Gilam -ide ab+ab- ise dikepwar-er
G.A formerN-Smbl thinkn Primpf spirit (married) femaleO
'Gilam thought as he had the last time that (she) was a ghost.'
The suffix -ise is frequently preceded by an affix -ka whose meaning is not
clear. Examples of its use are:
(2.117) ma pe siga
iri- Ii
kari-ka-yse
2SgA Deix ciggieO drink-Primpf lsg- ?- Smbl
'You smoke cigarettes as I do.'
lu+lu wi- ge iker- iyey

'They (2) did the same thing as what they had done at Erub.'
umer- kak wa- ykay Kosir-ika-yse
(2.119) nerut le
another persons knowN-Priv Fut3-make K.gen?-?- Smbl
'No-one knows how to make it (cocnnuted rice) like one's Kosir.'
(Note that in the above sentence, the privative phrase is functioning like a
predicate.)50It may be that the semblative suffixes -kayse and -ise do not signal anymeaningful difference but are simply in free alternation. Alternatively, it may beO,
mor.photogical distinction where common nouns take the form -ise and other
nominals (pronouns and proper nouns) take the form -kayse.
The suffix -kayse is also used with adjectives with a comparative effect:
(2.120) able wag kikem kelar- kak wam-i
Det windS first
strength-Priv blow-Pf
a
no abra
kelar
aw-ka-yse batay-0
Conj Restr 3SgGen strengths big-?- Smbl grow-Pf
'At first, the wind blew without strength (but then), its strength just
grew bigger (or big-like?).'
The related suffix -ka, which is often reduplicated on adjectives, occurs as a't\i
intensifier to indicate a greater or lesser degree:
(2.121) e
aw le
daIi
3SgS big person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a big/old man.'
(2.122) e
aw-ka+ka le
daIi
3SgS big- Intens person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is a very big/old person.'
In 2.122, -ka(ka) is functioning as an adjectival intensifier. There is a
similar derivation -kar which is added to nouns as an intensifier with the
meaning 'the real N, the even more like N':
(2.123) keymerkar
young sibling-Intens
'the youngest sibling'
(2.124) ukar
pe daIi
coconut-Intens Deix n PIS be(person?)-Prlmpf
'Those are the proper kind of palm trees.'
The suffix -ka occurring on adjectives and the suffix -kar occurring on
nouns could be related and these in turn are probably related to the semblative
construction with -kayse.
There are comparative constructions with the ablative case used to mark a
standard comparison (2.125 and 2.126) and the allative case used to mark the
property with respect to which a comparison is made (2.127):
(2.125) yaba

Note that the suffixes are affixed to a noun phrase which is part of a more
complex noun phrase, be it a pronoun or another noun.
Inclusion is an essential feature of this construction. If a pronoun occurs, it
must refer to the sum of the participants and the associative or dual phrase is
subordinate to it. Note that the cross-reference markers always treat the complex
noun phrase as non-singular. Below are examples to demonstrate the
grammaticality with a nonsingular pronoun and the unacceptability with a
singular pronoun:
(2.85) wa
net- ipkem bakyawda pamas-em?
2n SgS who-Ass
Pauc/PlS go-P£Pl shop- All
'With whom did you go to the shops?'

1n SgExclS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual shop- All
'We, mother and I, went to the shops.'
*ka amaey bakyamudaryey pamasem
It remains to be established whether the use of the associative suffix is a
distinct function and meaning. In this use, it has noun phrase function rather
than clause function. Clearly, however, the two uses are related in meaning.
Participation in the event is marked by the case of the complex whole noun
phrase and by the verbal cross-referencing.
Several sentence types need to be elicited in order to validate these claims:
• whether the associative phrase can ever be linked to an 0 argument, e.g. I saw
the man with his walking stick, or, I saw the man walking with his brother.
• whether the associative phrase can be used with a transitive verb with a plural
agent, e.g. They unloaded the things in front of Les (who did not help at all).
• whether the nonsingular marker attached to the first nominal in the complex
phrase can be omitted when it is an animate, e.g. Sigar omasker-kem bakyawda
Dawarem 'Sigar and his children went to Dawar.'","[54, 55]"
"38These are the only examples collected ending with -im.
8.
The ablative case (-lam/-ilam), like the allative case, has local, temporal
and causal meanings. It is used to mark the point from which there is
movement away:
(2.51) e
op- dewday- lam ta- bakyamu- da
3SgS face-mainland-Ahl Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
'He came from Papua New Guinea.'
(2.52) e
tabi paser-lam
3SgS Deix-climb down-Pf hill- Ahl
'He came down from the hill.'
This case inflection can also be used to mark the cause (of a non-finite
clause):
(2.53) ka gim+gim n(a)- aIi
waywi aro- lam
lSgS illness Adj 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf mangoO eatN-Abl
'I am sick from eating mangoes.'
It can also be extended in meaning to include a temporal notion, i.e. to
mark from a particular point in time:
(2.54) ki-lam 'from/ since last night'
emeret-lam 'from a long time ago'
9.
The genitive case (-ira - -ra) is used to mark the beneficiary or goal of an
action:
(2.55) ka laglag epey
a- rapeylu
kari
ama- ra
lSgS wantN basketO Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg lSgGen mother-Gen
'I want to buy a basket for my mother.'
Note that there is overlap in the functions of the allative case with its
purposive function and the genitive case with its beneficiary function. (It remains
to be tested whether it can also be used as a maleficiary.) It could be argued that in
Meryam Mir, the genitive case includes within its meaning both a benefactive
and purposive meaning. This would account for the more felicitous and
common sentence given below with the genitive rather than the allative case:
(2.56) kara
mekir
ageg
tiruko
lSgGen almond(tree) fleshy fruit?O Deix-pluck PIO-Fut2/3sg
'Pick me some almonds.'
?kari-m mekir ageg tiruk
-All
The two cases, namely the genitive and allative case, must have some
overlap in their function as well as permitting some slight nuance in meaning
because there are examples where the two cases co-occur within a single sentence:39(2.57)ka abra
kerkar wali

1SgA 3SgGen fresh clothingO Deix-3Gen-buy Sg/DualO-PfSg
tciwn-ge abi- m
town-Loe 3Sg-All
'I bought him a new shirt in town.'
Clearly more work needs to be done in this area to refine the distinctions
between the allative and genitive cases.
The genitive case is used to mark the possessor/owner of an alienable or
inalienable object/physical quality /person/body part:
asr- i
(2.58) ka pleyn-ira bUm.er dlsgA <Eng- Gen soundO 3Gen-hear-Pf

Gen hand/fingers cut- PfSg
W.'W arib's finger got cut.'
(2.60) Lez-ira newbet ewmi-da
L.- Gen FZ S die- PfSg
'Les' aunty died.'
The genitive case can also be used to mark the experiencer of a physical or
emotional state:
bark- i
(2.61) Galiga-ra werer
Gen hungers happen-Pf
G.'Galiga is hungry /Hunger happened for Galiga.'
(2.62) able lera weku bark- i
Det person-Gen angers happen-Pf
'That person is angry I Anger happened for that person.'
The genitive case cannot occur when the complex noun phrase itself is
marked by a case as in the following examples. In 2.63, it cannot occur with the
locative case; in 2.64, it cannot occur with the ergative case; in 2.65, it cannot
occur with the semblative case and in 2.66, it cannot occur within a noun phrase
itself marked by the genitive case:

1SgGen
The ending suffixed or pronominal form for the absent genitive is
phonologically homophonous with the 0 argument case form for proper nouns,
i.e. -i,or the accusative pronominal form. One could speculate that the case
marker for this argument is the accusative/ dative case marker as it is used in
adnominal possession, it is typically the base for oblique inflections on proper
nouns and pronouns and, it is used to mark definite or human direct objects.
Another possibility is that there are alternations in the form of the genitive case
morpheme itself, i.e. -i ,.. -y, used when the complex noun phrase in which it
occurs carries another case inflection. Evidence that these are indeed
morphological alternations of the genitive case can be seen by the fact that these
case markers also occur with common nouns (which do not take the case suffix -i
in the accusative case) when they are in a possessor relation within a case-marked
complex phrase:
(2.67) kari
newr-i
kimyaride abi detagr-i
1SgGen girl- Gen (married)male-A 3Sg0 tell- Pf
'My daughter's husband told him.'
Contrast with the lexical compound newr kimyar 'sister-in-law' where
there is no genitive marking (2.83):
(2.68) kari newr kimyaride abi detagri
'My sister-in-law told him.'
Another example follows of a common noun suffixed with the alternative
form of the genitive case:
(2.69) able amay werm-et abi detagr-i
Det mother-Gen child- SgA 3Sg0 tell- Pf
'The mother's son told him.'
*able ama wermet abi detagri
Although the genitive case marker cannot be confused with the accusative
case marker in the examples given above, there are many examples in the third
person singular where these two functions cannot be distinguished, that is where
the (pro)nominal phrase could be analysed as the 0 argument or as the
phonologically reduced genitive case. For example:
41ka abi

verb.)

(2.70)10.
The associative case (-kem) is suffixed to an inanimate noun to indicate
that it was associated although not used to perform the action:
(2.73) e
digm-i koketkem
3SgS walk- Pf walking stick-Ass
'He walked (carrying) his walking stick.'

(2.77) wi

'They (2) insulted each other.'
(lit: they (2) did things to each other using words)
The associative case -kem and the allomorph -ipkem (used with proper
nouns and possibly with kinship terms, e.g. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers),42are used to indicate that the person was associated with a particular event
although not a participant:
(2.78) lu

A similar form and parallel use occurs with pronominals:
(2.79) Dawgiri erkep ikereder
ge Bame-y erdar-i
0 see- Pf
D. S
eye n PIS be(thing)-n Prlmpf Deix Bta- ba- rb- i abi-tkem we- ge akarik-da
Deix-Intr-row-Pf 3Sg-Ass sand-Loe land- PfSg
'Dawgiri was watching when he saw Bame swimming (towards the area
where Dawgiri was) and right in front of Dawgiri, Bame came up onto the
beach.' (Dewmer p210, section12)
Andrews (1985) makes a useful distinction between circumstantial and
participatory roles which correspond neatly to the associative versus
instrumental case. The associative case involves a circumstantial role as the
phrase forms ""part of the setting of the event"" whilst the instrumental case
involves a participatory role with the phrasE; an ""actual participant in the
situation implied by the verb"" (Andrews, Ibid; 69). An argument marked with
-kem/-ipkem is signalling that the thing/person was present although not an
instrument or participant in the activity.
How does the associative differ from the locative when the locative case
carries a comitative meaning? Whilst the locative case is marked on an animate
noun to indicate thats/he performed the same action at the same place as the
S/ A, the associative case is also marked on an animate noun but to indicate that
s/he was at the same place although not performing the event/activity.
However, there is a further use of the associative suffix which is exploited in a
participatory role to indicate paucal or plural inclusion; in this use, it is always
within a complex noun phrase. This function will be examined in the following
section.
Number marking within a complex phrase.
The suffixes -ey 'Dual' and -kem 'Pauc/Pl or Associative' are used within a
complex phrase to indicate that the phrase is dual or paucal/plural respectively:
(2.80) able bab taba newrey...
Det father 3Gen (unmarried)female-Dual
'The father with his daughter.. .' (Dewmer, p208, section4)
(2.81) ...epe Mesnare-yba Eydyana-ey abi ti- ditagr-iyey...
3SgA?-Deix M.n Sg E.Dual 3Sg0 Deix-tell- PfDual
' ... where Mesnare and Eidiana told her .. .'","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"

"19There are no consonant clusters that can occur word-initially or word-finally
although as mentioned in the previous section, consonant plus glide clusters can
occur word-initially, and glide plus consonant clusters can occur word-finally.
The types of consonant clusters which can occur in word-medial position
are not restricted and gaps in their occurrence are likely to be due to the paucity of
data rather than actual restrictions. This apparent freedom in cluster types is the
result of nouns and verbs formed into complex stems, processes such as
reduplication and vowel deletion with certain conjugations and affixation of
certain morphemes. The examples given in the section on syllables indicated
that an analysis which relies on the occurrence of phoneme sequences alone, i.e.
a phonotactic study, will fail to predict why some consonant clusters are
acceptable whilst others are not (such as consonant clusters at word boundaries).
It was suggested that a closer examination of the internal structure of the syllable
might be a more profitable way of looking at the data. An alternative approach
would be to examine whether clusters differ within a word root as opposed to at a
morpheme boundary. It is not always, however, apparent where the root
boundaries are.
This study will restrict itself to giving examples and listing the consonant
clusters that have been collected.
The basic phonotactic structure of a word is as follows:
(C1)V(CC2V)(C3t
where
V=any vowel
u 'coconut (tree)'
e '3SgA/S'
i 'tears', deictic marker
a conjunction
o 'liver'
Cl= all consonants (glides are included in this category) can occur word initiallyexcept /r/
One word has been collected starting with /r/ namely rom 'type of dark
cloud which appears out at sea'. However, this word only appears in a song and
may have been borrowed from Kalaw Lagaw Ya or some other language.

'aeroplane'.)

3SgA E.0 growl- Pf
'He growled Eidiana.'
There are also morphophonological alternations:
-i -> -y I V+ ex. Selayna-y 'Selaina (0)'
-0 I y + ex. Pomoy-0 'Pomoy (O)'
ex. Kinor-i 'Kinor (0)'
-i I elsewhere
4.
The -e case inflection is also used with common nouns to mark both the S
of an intransitive verb and the 0 of a transitive verb, i.e. an absolutive case
pattern:
(2.15) able aw le0 ab- i
Det big person-S fall-Pf
'The old man fell.'
(2.16) able kebi leiut aw le0 eparsi-da
Det little person-SgA big person-0 hitPfSg
'The youth punched the old man.'
5.
The locative case inflection (-ge I -idoge) is used to mark the place where
the event occurs or the end point of a verb of motion:
(2.17) ka meta- ge b- aClari
lSgS house-Loe Intr-put in Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I entered into the house.'
(2.18) e
lewer t- ero-li
taba uteb- ge
3SgA foodO Deix-eat-Prlmpf 3Gen place-Loe
'He is eating at his place.'
The form -idoge is used to mark the Locative case with proper nouns:
(2.19) Lez-idoge
L.- Loe
'at Les""
*Lez-ge
It can also be used with a proper noun to indicate the possessor's place, i.e.
the person's place at which the event occurs:
(2.20) ka ut
eydida Eydyana-ydoge
lSgS sleepN. n PIS lie down-PfSg E.Loe
'I slept at Eidiana's place.'
(The example given above might also be possible to interpret with a comitative
meaning although this has to be checked.)34The locative case is also used with a secondary meaning with animate
nouns to convey the meaning of accompaniment, i.e. a comitative meaning:
(2.21) e
abi
kimyarge digm-i pamas-em
3SgS 3SgGen married male-Loe walk-Pf shop- All
'She walked with her husband to the shops.'
There is a syntactic restriction in that there cannot be two locative
arguments used in a single clause. Contrast the previous example (2.21) in which
the allative case is used for the second peripheral argument with the following
ungrammatical example (2.22) where two locative arguments occur:
(2.22) *e abi kimyar-ge digmi pamas-ge
LoeThe restriction on two locative phrases co-occurring is resolved by either
the phrase referring to a place being marked with the allative case or the animate
noun being marked with the associative case:
(2.23) wi
kimyarkem namiredi
able uteb- ge
3n SgS married male-Ass 3n SgS-n PIS be sitting-Prlmpf Det place-Loe
/
'The two of them, she along with her husband. are sitting at that place.'
There is a correlation between the locative case, used with animate nouns
to mark accompaniment with verbs of motion, and the associative case, used with
animate nouns to mark accompaniment with verbs of non-motion.
The locative case can sometimes be used as a local (syntactic?) argument
reflecting cultural mores or habits. Consider the verb ispi(r) 'marry, hide' tr.vb.
and espi(r) intr.vb.:
(2.24) kimyaride abi ispi- da
married male-A 3Sg0 marry-PfSg
'The man married her.'
Contrast with the following:
(2.25) koskir mayk- e espi- da
womans widower-Loe marry-PfSg
'The woman married the widower.'
In the first example, the man is the A argument marked by the ergative
case whilst in the second example, the woman is the S argument marked by the
absolutive case. The widower whom she is marrying is marked by the locative
case indicating that it is a peripheral argument and also conveys that the place she
will live henceforth will be her husband's abode. (The locative case does not refer
to the place where the marriage ceremony was held.)
The locative case is used to mark the physical or emotional state of the
experiencer:
(2.26) e
nyap- ge daIi
3SgS thirst-Loe n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
'He is thirsty.'","[44, 45, 46]"
"140One pair of verbs has been recorded where the alternation between the
intransitive and transitive form involves the sequence I di/. It corresponds to the
same transitiviser process with the addition of the consonant:
epigerner 'change'
dipigerner 'change, turn over'
e- 'Word Formative' Derivation.
As the reader may have noted from the examples cited above, there is a
high correlation of telic verbs, both transitive and intransitive, whose roots or
stems begin with /e/. It may be that verbs have phonotactic restrictions in their
occurrence in having to commence with (d)V. As a consequence of this
restriction, verbs that begin with a non-permissible consonant are prefixed with
the formative I e/.
The plural intransitive telic prefix ba- and the formative e- are mutually
exclusive, e.g. ewrni 'n PIS die' and ba-wrn 'PIS die'. Similarly, the intransitiviser
ba- and the formative e- are mutually exclusive, e.g. erap 'break' and ba-rap 'be
broken'. Here are some transitive and intransitive verbal forms (see also
examples from the transitiviser section):
intransitive telic verbs:
ernri
'Sg/DualS sit down'
emer
'PaucS sit down'
ekyarn
'n PIS get up'
esemu
'Sg/DualS finish'
egur
'n PIS bathe'
kab emar 'n PIS dance' (lit: danceN.-?)
ewparnar 'n PIS jump'
erer ekri
'n PIS shout, bark, squawk' (lit: cryN.-?)

It is unclear what the affix marker -dar- means. It may be from the paucal
number suffix or from an old auxiliary. In some cases, it appears completely
lexicalised to the meaning of the verb, e.g. er-(dar-) 'watch' where all verbal
inflected forms occur with the affix -dar-: a-r-dar-e Fut1, er-dar-i Pf, er-dar-iyey
PfDual, er-dar-dare P£Pauc, er-dar-da P£Pl, but consider its nominalised form: irem 'to watch' (lit: see-All). In some cases, it is only found on the paucal/plural
forms of verbs, e.g. upi diti 'help Sg/DualO', upi diti-dar- 'help Pauc/PlO', but
consider the nominalised form: upi a-ti-dar-em 'to help'. In some cases, it occurs
optionally with nonpresent durative inflections, e.g. ewsmer 'Sg/DualS come
out', ewsme-dar-er - ewsmer-er n Prlmpf, but ewsme-li Prlmpf, *ewsme-da(r)-li,
e~g. ekyam 'wake up', ba-kyam-er - ba-kyam-dar-er PIS n Prlmpf:
(3.241) gayr idimge wi
o- ba- kyam- er
many morning-Loe 3n SgS Fut3-Pl5-wake up-n Prlmpf

'I will keep going outside to smoke.'
(3.243) Lez no w- ewsmedar-er
lokot telam
L.S Restr Fut3-n PIS come out-?- n Prlmpf bush opening-Ahl
'Les will always only come out from the back door.'
In some cases, it is obligatorily suffixed with all durative type inflections:
e.g. b-aw 'Sg/DualS go in', b-a-da(r)-li Prlmpf, *ba-li, b-a-dar-er n Prlmpf, *ba-r-er;
mir atrum 'suggest Sg/DualO', atrum-da(r)-li PrlmpfSg, *atrum-li.
Whilst it is not possible to predict when it will occur, it is possible to see a
recurrent meaning associated with the suffix, namely that all events are nonpunctiliar as they are either extended in time, repeated several times or over a
long time period. It may be that it is historically derived from a non-punctiliar
derivational morpheme.
Adverbs.
There are only two words which occur exclusively as adverbs. These are
nab '(attempt) unsuccessfully' and mirem 'try':

The allative case is used to mark the goal/place of motion:
(2.37) ka n(a)- akomelu
meta- em
lSgS Futl-n PIS return-FutlSg house-All
'I will go home.'
(2.38) i
ba- tweri gesep- em
3n SgS PIS-climb down-Pf ground-All
'They climbed down to the ground.'
It is also used to mark the purposive (of a non-finite clause):
(2.39) ki
na- ba lewer-em
ln SgExclS Futl-go food- All
'We (excl) will go for food.'
(2.40) ka
newrem dasme-li
lSgA/S? unmarried female-All seePrlmpf
'I am looking for the girl.'
It can also be used as an indirect object, to mark the noun phrase toward
which the action is directed. For this reason, the allative case could have been
glossed as the dative case as it appears to fulfil some of the functions of the dative.
However, as many of the functions are also covered by a second accusative case,
the use of the term dative has been omitted from the case system altogether.
Following are some examples of the allative case with indirect object function:
(2.41) e
deketida
3SgS look quickly-PfSg
'He glanced over.'
(2.42) e
nar- em deketida
3SgS boat-All look quickly-PfSg
'He glanced over at the boat.'",[48]
"90The intransitive/plurals marker must occur in that particular slot in the
verb structure as there are examples where the initial CV of the verb root is
deleted and replaced by this marker. For example, dikmerik 'put Sg/DualO
resting upon something'--> ba-kmerik 'Sg/DualS rest upon something'; dasmer
'look'---> ba-smer 'look at oneself'.
In order to account for the co-occurrence of the 1st person future prefix and
the intransitive/plurals marker, the future prefix na- has to be stated twice, in the
verb root slot(1) and in a prefix position (slot 2).
•
The 1st person future and 1 /2 person associated number morphemes can be
distinguished from each other on the basis of their different allomorphs. The 1st
person future morpheme has the allomorph -a- used with transitive verbs. The
1/2 person associated number morpheme has no allomorph -a- since the initial
consonant plus vowel of the verb root are always deleted when this marker is
prefixed. Examples are:
(3.40) ka abi d-atagr-e
1SgA 3Sg0 1-Futl-1 tell- Futl
'I will tell him.'
marl natagr-i kikem
(3.41) ka
1SgA 2Sg01/2Sg0-tell-Pf after
'I told you first.'
•
Although the 1/2 person associated morpheme and the 3rd person
associated morpheme are homophonous, i.e. na-, their occurrence in the verb
structure differs. The 3rd person associated morpheme is an infix whereas the
1/2 person associated morpheme is a prefix. To illustrate this difference consider
the contrastive examples:
(3.42) ma kari ta- ratager-o
Umar-ge
2SgA 1Sg0 Deix-1/2Sg0-tell- Fut2/3 U.- Loe
'Tell me over there at Umar.'
(3.43) ma yabi
ta- da-ratager-o
2SgA 3n SgO Deix-1 -3n SgO- I tell- Fut2/3
'Tell the two of them over there.'
(Note that the verb root detager 'tell' becomes I da-tager I when there is an infix.)
When the 1 /2 person associated morpheme is affixed, the initial CV of the
verb root is deleted and the prefix na- (-ra-) is affixed whereas when the 3rd
person associated morpheme is affixed, it is infixed following the initial CV of the
verb root. Consequently, the two morphemes are homophonous in form but
distinct in function and placement.
•
For other homophonous morphemes, they can be distinguished from one
another because they are in fact co-occurring morphemes. For example, the past
irrealis and remote past marker involve the same prefix morpheme as 3rd person
future but not the same suffix morpheme:91(3.44)(3.45)wio- dasmer-lam

The intensifier -kar is affixed to nouns to indicate the superlative of the
type, the most characteristic. As examples were given earlier, these will not be
repeated.
Examples need to be elicited with case inflections to see whether these are
grammatical or not:
? ukar- ide kari napit-i
coconut-Intens-A lSgO 1/2Sg0-hit-Pf
'The actual palm tree hit me.'
With this affix, some stems are inflectional, others are lexicalised.
Consider:
(2.128) !ewer
'food'
-kar
'intensifier'
lewer-kar 'type of yam' (lit: real food)
2.2.4 Derivations.
1)
There is a derivational suffix -kem homophonous with the associative case
suffix which derives adjectives from nouns. Whether or not this is a productive,
semi-productive or lexical device remains to be seen as only two examples have
been collected so far. Its meaning can be roughly glossed as 'characterised by' or
'having the characteristic of':
(2.129) mir- kem le
word-Ass person
'a preacher'
(2.130) ged- kem le
land-Ass person
'land-owner'
2)
Nominals (both nouns and adjectives) can be derived from verbs through
a regular phonological process which involves the initial (consonant plus) vowel
of the verb changing. Some examples of nominalised verbs being used as an
adjective or noun follow:52(2.131) e
o- bakyamu lewer arap- em
3SgS Fut3-Sg/DualS go foodO buyN-All
'He will go buy food.' (cf. 2.39)
(2.132) akasir+akasir lu
ikeredi
cook Adj
things n PIS be(thing)-Pr
'(It)'s a cooking utensil.'
As the reader may have noted, the adjectival derivation process can
involve reduplication as well although it is still the same process:
erap 'buy' verb --> arap noun
dikasir 'cook' verb--> akasir noun
The derivational process is as follows:
verbs--------------> nominals
The initial consonant, if there is one, is deleted.
A stressed word initial vowel /6/ becomes /aw/:
#(C) 6 -------- > # aw
An example is:
6g 'climb'--> awgog 'the climb' (as well as reduplication of verbal root?)
(the derivation might be from: aw(g) 'big'+og 'climb')
A stressed word initial vowel /f/ becomes I ay I when it is followed by a single
consonant and /i/. It becomes /aw/ elsewhere:
#(C) r - - - - > #ay / - c 1 i
------->#aw I elsewhere
Examples include:
dfmi 'close'---> aymir+aymir 'closed Adj'
dfski 'open'---> awskir 'tombstone opening'
(Note that verbs ending with a vowel have /r/ suffixed as well.)
A stressed word initial vowel I e/ becomes I a/ if it is followed by a glide and it
remains the same elsewhere:
#(C) e -------> #a I - c [+glide]
----------> #e I elsewhere
Examples include:
ewsmer 'go out, be born'---> awsmer 'birthday'
eydi 'lie down'---> aydir+aydir lu 'mattress'
erwer 'learn'---> erwer meta 'school' (lit: learnN+house)
(One counter-example has been collected in the data where ew -----> #ew,
e.g. ewmi 'die'---> ewd+ewd 'deadly' *awd+awd. However, as the derivation
also involves a change in the consonant, i.e. m ---> d, this could be an irregular
or unrelated form.)53A stressed word initial I a/ remains the same:
#(C) a. ---------->#a
An example follows:
akem 'dip'---> akem 'dippingN'
An unstressed initial vowel becomes I a/:#(C)V ------------>#a
Examples include:
dirmisir 'start'---> armisir 'beginning'
ero 'eat'---> aro+aro 'edible'
akarik 'land'--> akarik 'landing'
okayret 'break (of dawn)'---> akayret 'daybreak'
erap 'buy'--> arap le 'vendor'
dikasir 'cook' ---> akasir le 'cook'542.2.5 Nominal Compounds.
Many examples occur in the data of several nouns juxtaposed within a
single phrase. The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that these are
compounds and can be categorised into different types, lexical and syntactic. A
comparison will be made between compounds and modified nominals as well as
complex noun phrases involving the genitive construction, to show similarities
and differences. Compounds are the result of a morphological or lexical process
whereas modified nominals, be they adjectives or genitive constructions, are the
result of a syntactic process.","[62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"
"IllIll is a voiced alveolar lateral which can sometimes sound quite 'dark' or
velarized when it occurs at the end of a word or syllable:
/1/
----->f I - #
mel'pcnr'black sea snake'
C
Ga.l'gal' 'nickname for Galiga'
BuMntt' 'place name'
manyapu~ 'pawpaw'
abal 'pandanus fruit'
-------->! I elsewhere
lam 'leaf'
goli 'squid sp.'
nalu 'what?'/ml
/n/
The voiced nasal stops are produced by air passing through the nasal
cavity with the lips pressed together for the bilabial stop and the tongue pressed
against the alveolar ridge for the alveolar stop. Note that the nasal stops
correspond to the point of articulation of the bilabial and apical stops although
there is a gap in the system as there is no nasal corresponding to the velar oral
stop.;w/
/y/
The glides include the bilabial continuant /w I and the palatal continuant
iy/. It is not dear-cut as to whether these are phonemically consonants or vowels
and the following discussion raises some of the reasons for considering each
analysis in preference to the other.
Arguments for considering the glides as underlying vowels:
(i)
There is a speech style called nasnas mir 'sorry talk' which is used by the
speaker to convey sympathy I grief for the topic (which might also be the
addressee). The phonetic change that takes place only affects verbs and more
specifically the initial vowel or vowel plus glide sequence in the verb. If the
initial vowel is /a/, then a glide /w/ is prefixed to it. If it is any other vowel or
vowel plus glide, these are deleted and a back vowel /u/, /o/ or /w/ is inserted:10#V[ +high,+front] C V[ +high,+front] ----> #u C V[+high,+front]
---> #(C) wa
#(C) a
-----> #(C) o
elsewhere
For example:
dwali 'n PIS be(person) Primpf'
da-li
---->
dogem 'walk'
digem
---->
or6 'eat'
er6
---->
iri
---->
uri 'smoke, drink'
When there is a vowel plus glide sequence, both phones are deleted and
replaced by a back vowel:
ewpamaret------> 6pamaret 'jump'
This provides some evidence that these are underlying vowels for the fact
is that the replacement by the vowel affects both vowel and glide if there is one.
This suggests that glides could be part of the vowel system as rules affecting
vowels also affect them.
On the other hand, it is generally regarded that glides do share features in
common with vowels and hence their frequent label as semi-vowels. The above
phonetic changes can simply be regarded as evidence of features in common
between vowels and glides.
(ii)
There is an example of a word that has the sequence glide plus vowel and
when it is abbreviated, the glide becomes syllabic which suggests it must be
underlyingly a vowel:
negwam ------>
negu 'cousin'
(i.e. w --> u)
Conversely, one can state the change in terms of a glide becoming syllabic when
there is no other vowel in the syllable.
(iii)
There is morphophonemic evidence that at least some verbs have as their
underlying form a vowel sequence rather than a vowel plus glide sequence:
b-6s 'pl S be born'
e-wsmer 'n PIS be born' (i.e. underlyingly eo)
parallel to:
ba-wm 'pl S die'
e-wmi 'nonpl s die' (i.e. underlyingly ew)
The use of the glide symbol in the word ewsmer obscures the
morphophonemic relationship between the sequence /ew/ and /o/ whereas if
one represents it as a vowel sequence /eo/ (with rules that apply later and
transform the sequence eo --->ew, the change is more transparent and easier to
account for. However, the relationship between the two forms is not always as
clear. If one considers the following examples where the future 1st person is
marked by the infixation of the vowel I a/, in the first example, i--->aw whilst in
the second example, i---->ay:
diski 'open Sg/DualO'
I Idawskilu 'open Sg/DualO Futl'
dimi 'close Sg/DualO'
daymilu 'close Sg/DualO Futl'
Thus, the rule can only be formulated very generally stating that an
accented vowel will become a vowel plus glide sequence when an affix (prefix or
infix) is attached. Is it appropriate to use morphology to prove something in the
domain of phonology? Whilst it is the linguist's task to assemble data from all
areas and assess these in relation to each other, it does not necessarily follow that
an analysis in one area justifies a particular analysis in a different area.
(iv) There are examples in the data where the vowel plus glide sequence
sounds like a complex rather than a single peak; it sounds like two syllables
rather than a single syllable. Examples contrasting single and complex peaks
follow:
peybri-peibri 'name of a clan, moiety(?)'(3syll) peym 'dream'(lsyll)
bawr- baur 'spear'(2syll)
baw 'enter'(lsyll)
Bewr- Beur 'village name'(2syll)
Dew 'village name'(lsyll)
Note that if the examples in the first group were transcribed with the extra
syllable (e.g. eyi), then there could be no claim that the underlying forms were a
monophone vowel sequence as they would represent a sequence of two syllables
with the glide marking a syllable boundary. On the other hand, if these were
transcribed as a single syllable (e.g. eyC), the task would remain to account for
why the first group of words sound different to the second group and if these are
phonetically as opposed to phonemically distinct.
There are two complex peaks in the following environments:
(i) There is an accented vowel I e/ and palatal glide followed by a voiced
consonant cluster, e.g. peybri [pefuri] 'clan name', eyrsida [eirsida] 'SgS moored
(Pf)'. Contrast with: neys [neys] 'two', peym [peym] 'dream', deyb [deyb]
'swelling, mound'.
(ii) There is a front accented vowel and bilabial glide followed by a consonant,
e.g. ewmida [eumida] 'SgS die (Pf)', gewm [geum] 'fear', iwri [iilri] - ewri [euri]
'SgS weave (Pf)', newr [neur] 'unmarried female', newd [neud] 'parrot fish',
ewsmeda [eusmeda] 'SgS come out (Pf)', ewtmer [eutmer] 'ask'. Contrast with:
new [new] 'ripe', Dew [dew] 'village name'.
(iii) There is an accented vowel and glide followed by a voiced consonant /r /,
e.g. toyr [t6ir] 'fat', gayr [gafr] 'many', wawr [waur] 'type of wind', bawr [baur]
'spear', teyr [tefr] 'decorated'. Contrast with: ays [ays] 'bring Pauc/PlO', Koyti
[k6yti] 'name of person', waw [waw] 'yes', Bawz [bawz] 'name of village', awmkep
[awmkep] 'type of cloud', aydir+aydir [aydir+aydir] 'lie Adj'.
The same data could be examined reaching the conclusion that a vowel
sequence is a valid analysis. Glides do share features with vowels and their12ability to become syllabic or maybe make the syllable sound longer is a
consequence of one such feature.
Arguments for considering the glides as underlying consonants.
(i)
There are only sequences of vowel plus glides or glides plus vowels within
the one syllable. Other vowel sequences always occur over two syllables with a
glide intervening although it may not be very prominant, e.g. kayed
'grandparent', keyar 'crayfish', eyu 'type of grass', iyu 'tears Instr', Mowa 'island
name'. Phonotactically, the glide occurs in a position typically occupied by a
consonant and thus, could be regarded as part of the consonant system.
(ii)
With some lexemes, there are examples of two glides and a vowel within
the one syllable:
syaw 'sneeze'
bway 'kinspeople'
way 'seed inside the coconut'
yey 'large blind shark'
waw 'yes, hole'
If glides are analysed as underlying vowels, then an account must be made
in the phonotactics of a possible sequence of three vowels- a somewhat unusual
phenomenon amongst languages of the world. If, however, the glides are
analysed as underlying consonants, then a sequence eve can be hypothesized- a
pattern which can be found elsewhere in the language.
The analysis of glides as consonants will still require further specification
in the phonotactic outline of the language because the only clusters that are
permitted word initially are those of a consonant plus glide type.
(iii)
Glides will have to be postulated to account for their use across morpheme
boundaries:
tutu-em-tutuw-em 'type of doll-all'
,
,
'tears-ms
• tr
1-u-1y-u
6+o-6w+o 'courageous' (lit: liver+liver)
le-em-ley-em-le-m 'person-all'
IThe decision as to whether glides are part of the consonant system or part
of the vowel system cannot be made at this stage of the analysis. More data and
evidence needs to be collected. In this analysis, glides will be presented as part of
the consonant system although this is only tentative.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"
"Examples of juxtaposed nouns can be analysed as nominal compounds for
the following reasons:
(i)
Modifiers precede the noun they qualify and when these occur with
compounds, they cannot interupt it but must precede it and modify both parts of
it:
(2.133) parko+parko kole
mir
imperfect Adj European word
'imperfect English'
*kole parko+parko mir
(2.134) aw lu
tam
big tree,thing branch
'big branch'
*'branch of the big tree'
*lu aw tam
(ii)
Some compounds are clearly lexical in so far as the meaning of the
compound cannot be gleaned from the sum of the components:
(2.135) beyzam
mi
hammerhead shark clam
'clam sp.'
(2.135) apu
le
mother person
'MZS/D'
(iii) For at least some of the compounds) whose components are monosyllabic,
the high pitch-accent only occurs on the second component of the compound
thus indicating a single phonological word and 0. ~hift in 1-IJe accent:
(2.136) bey
lid
palm leaf bone
'palm leaf stem'
(2.137) lu
sik
tree,thing flower
'flower'55There are two kinds of compounds: compound lexemes and syntactic
compounds. Syntactic compounds are those which Lyons (1977; 535) describes as
'regular derived lexemes in that their meaning and distribution can be accounted
for in terms of the productive rules of the language system; and for that reason,
they need not be listed in the lexicon'. Compound lexemes, on the other hand,
have to be listed in the lexicon as they are either idiomatic in their meaning or
the individual components cannot be isolated in form or meaning.
Examples of compound lexemes whose meanings cannot be deduced from
their components include:
(2.138) newr
kimyar
unmarried female married male
'unmarried sister-in-law'
(2.139) wer
sor
star,egg shell
'turtle egg'
(2.140) berbet apu
sibling mother
'FZ'Examples where there have been phonological changes at the morpheme
boundary so that the meaning and form of the components can only be
hypothesized on the basis of parallel syntactic compounds include:
(2.141) imus
'beard'
<ib 'jaw', mus 'hair'
Parallel to the syntactic compound:
(2.142) op
mus
(upper)face hair
'moustache'
(2.143) gesep
'earth, land'
<ged 'land (mass), sep 'earth'
Parallel to the syntactic compound:
(2.144) ged
kawr
land(mass) island
'island'
Examples where a gloss cannot be found for one of the components as a
result of some phonological change or where a free form has not been obtained,
include:
(2.145) gilid
'shoulder bone'
<gir '?', lid 'bone'56(although gir was collected by Ray as meaning 'boar's tusk, a charm worn on the
chest')
(2.146) kirgir makrem
?

(2.147) sursur werem

2SgGen nappie? still back-Loe be stuck on-Pr
'You are still a spring chicken.'

(.Snn t.Ak~I/ 1 C!'3~ i ~ Z.G)
?
tide
'king tide'
(2.149) wadali
lewer
honey ant? food
'rice'
As the reader can note, some of the compound lexemes lacking a gloss for
one of their components are simply the result of gaps in the data and further
elicitation may result in these being re-categorised as syntactic compounds.
Syntactic compounds can be distinguished from compound lexemes in
terms of the productivity of the process. There are roughly nine different types of
syntactic compounds. The labels given for each type are not designed to capture
the full semantic explication but to provide the means by which to contrast each
type. The different types are as follows:
(Nl= initial component of the compound; N2= final component of the
compound)

One of the reasons for postulating syntactic compounds in Meryam Mir is
their ability to occur without the initial compo·nt-1'\i. Thus, reference is made to a
particular well within the same text as both pat 'well' and ni pat 'water well'.
However, if this is used as the sole criterion for distinguishing compound
lexemes from syntactic compounds, then several compounds that have been
discussed as lexemes could be re-classified as syntactic. For example, beyzam mi
'clam sp.' (lit: hammerhead shark-dam) could be referred to as simply mi 'clam'.
An additional feature of syntactic compounds is the presence of a semantic
head noun. The fact that the initial component of a compound may be omitted
suggests that the two nouns are not of equal status but with the initial noun in a
dependent or modifier relationship to the second head noun. Another feature is
that syntactic compounds tend to have a more literal meaning than lexical
compounds.

"3Aside from the sources listed above, the material for this study was mainly
drawn from data collected from 7 months' fieldwork on Mer (Murray Island)
during the periods October 1987-January 1988 and from April-June 1988.
Ethnographic Notes.
Mer can only be described as a tropical paradise with swaying palms and
deep crystal-blue coral sea. The two islands dose-by to Mer are the islands of
Dawar and Wayer, to which people often travel on the weekends in order to get
away from the 'hustle and bustle' of the main island (see map on p. v). These
islands are said to have been created when the wind blew up the nostrils of a
mythological ancestor, Gilam, who then sneezed, throwing two seeds into the
water which then became the islands. Gilam travelled across from M6wa Island
inside the shape of a dugong which he had carved from wood in a desperate
attempt to get away from his mother! When he came to Mer, he lay down on
what became the hill of Gilam, flicked the left flipper of the dugong>which was
filled with food>and created a rich and productive soil found especially on the
eastern side of the island.
The fertile volcanic soil and dense coral reef surrounding the islands
provide the people of Mer with ample food supplies such as fish, sardines, turtles
and many different types of yams, cassava, bananas, coconuts, mangoes, pawpaws,
bellfruit, wild almonds and countless others.
The people are Melanesian with their own distinctive language and culture
although there have been, and continue to be) strong influences from contact with
other Torres Strait Islanders, Europeans, South Pacific Islanders (at least in former
times), and many other peoples. In the late nineteenth century, Europeans
became interested in the area for evangelistic reasons and for commercial reasons
as it is rich in marine resources. The widespread effects of this contact on the
culture and langu.age are evidenced, for example, in songs and dances. Meryam
people, however, pride themselves on their retention of the original songs and
dances of Mer which they appropriately call kab-kar 'true dance' (lit: danceintensifier).
Ceremonies, both religious and secular, draw people together at various
times of the year, especially around Christmas when many people return home
to see family and friends. There will be feasts, singing and dancing sometimes
lasting all through the night for several consecutive evenings. At such times,
two groups of dancers will playfully compete with each other as to who can dance
the best and the longest. The two groups are named after two clan names, Peybri
and K6met, although members are not exclusively from these clans.
Island life appears idyllic but there are pressures exerted on the community.
These come from family and community who have a strong desire to develop4.","[14, 15]"
"128(i.e. It is underlyingly a d-d sequence with deletion, or the cross-reference marker
is absent altogether and it is the pronominal form only which is providing
number information.)
The number of inanimate objects can always be expressed through
independent lexical modifiers:

Such choices are no doubt pragmatically determined and a larger corpus of
data will reveal what are the factors.
Number Markers for S of Intransitive Telic Verbs by Prefixes.
Some intransitive telic verbs carry plural number information by means of
a prefix ba-. Those verbs marking plurality by means of a prefix (as opposed to a
suffix) are all predictable insofar as they all begin with a vowel in their
(underlying) verb root:
b- 6g- i

Complications arise from the fact that this marker is homophonous with
the intransitive marker ba- and it is sometimes used to mark both functions or one or the other:

intransitiviser and as a number marker indicating plural S.)Number Markers for S of Intransitive Telic Verbs and A of Transitive Telic Verbs
by Suffixes.
Suffixes indicating the temporal/aspectual/mood of the sentence also
indicate the number of S/ A of telic verbs. The table using the perfective category
to show the number cross-referencing follows:

Number Markers for 0 by Suffixes.
The previous section discussed how suffixes cross-reference A and S
arguments of telic verbs. However, these markers can also cross-reference 0
arguments provided these do not conflict with the number hierarchy which can
be very broadly summarized as Pauc/PlA/O > Sg/DualA/O; that is paucal or
plural number 0 arguments can take precedence in the number suffix slot over
singular or dual A arguments. In other words, we find examples of Pauc/PlO
animates being marked by suffixes when there 'are 5~/D~l A an;mates:

' ...They (all) spoke Meryam; they (a few of them) then asked Abob and

(DualO>non SingularA)
Several possibilities can be suggested to account for these. This use may
reflect changes happening in the language such as that documented by
McConvell (1983; 26) who notes that there is 'loss of the trial/plural number
distinction intransitives' amongst speakers under about forty years old and so,
the number hierarchy is sometimes not applied. (This is less likely to be the
reason given that both of these utterances were by speakers in their fifties and
above.) It may be that such features are more sensitive to pragmatic features or
that indefiniteness in number for A is tolerated when its number and identity
have been clearly established elsewhere. A larger corpus of data monitoring these
factors would be desirable.
In addition, the number hierarchy needs to be explored with respect to ditransitive verbs where there are potentially two O's competing for cross-reference
marking in the suffix slot. It can be tentatively stated that when this is the case,
the animate 0 will take precedence over the inanimate 0:
(3.218) peybri legize komet le
nam nakwarda
name person-PIA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Sg/Dual0-P£Pl
'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, a turtle.'
(The above example is interesting as it also illustrates how overt lexical number
marking for A will permit the cross-reference marking on the verb to include
number of A and 0.)
Although the hierarchy for animates over inanimates sugges1sa loss of
information for number of 0, the reader is reminded that forms of the verb roots
themselves often carry such information:133(3.219) peybri legize komet le
nam n(a)- ayswerda
name person-PlA name personO turtleO 3n SgO-give Pauc/PlO-PiPl
'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, turtles.'
Problems and Semantic Motivation for Conjugations 1. and 2.
The particular type of cross-reference marking used (i.e. from type 1. or type
2.) may also be carrying information about the 0 arguments. At first glance, the
different types appear totally arbitrary carrying no number information as
evidenced by the fact that both can occur with intransitive telic verbs:
e.g. bayter 'sink'
---> baytr-i 'SgS sink Pf';
ekyam 'get up'
---> ekyam-da(ri) 'SgS get up Pf';
---> bakyam-i 'PIS get up Pf';
bakyamu 'Sg/DualS go'
---> bakyamu-da(ri) 'SgS go Pf';
bakyaw 'Pauc/PlS go'
---> bakyaw-da 'PIS go Pf'.
Similarly, both types can occur with transitive telic verbs:
e.g. ero 'eat'
---> irw-i 'SgA eat Pf';
etomer 'show Sg/DualO' ---> etome-da(ri) 'SgS show Sg/DualO Pf'.
erap 'buy Pauc/PlO'
---> erap-i 'SgA buy PIO Pf';
---> erap-da 'PIA buy PIO Pf';
There is evidence, however, that at least in some cases, the inflections are
not arbitrary, but meaningful as they contrast with one another, within a single
verbal paradigm. With a couple of transitive verbs, the morphemes from
conjugation 1. -dari, -daryey, etc. always refer to singular or dual 0 arguments
(contrasting these with morphemes from conjugation 2. -i, -iyey, etc. which do
not refer to singular or dual 0 arguments). For example, the verb emarik 'send':
(3.220) ka
able netat zyawali emarik-dari
lSgA Det one bookO send- PfSg
'I sent the one book.'
(3.221) ka able zyawali emark-i
1SgA Det bookO send- Pf
'I sent the letters.'
(3.222) ka
wali
itrumda
1SgA clothingO take down-PfSg
'I took down my dress.'
(3.223) ka
kara
wali
itrumi
1SgA 1SgGen clothingO take down-Pf
'I took down my clothes.'
However, whilst there are only a few of these transitive verbs marking the
number of 0 arguments explicitly by contrasting conjugation markers 1. and 2,
there are many transitive verbs with related root forms where conjugation type1341, i.e. -dari, -daryey, etc, occurs consistently with singular I dualO. Here are a few
examples to illustrate:
irmida(ri)
(<irmi)
(3.224) ka netat pil
lSgA one <Eng swallow Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I swallowed the pill.'
(<irim)
i(3.225) ka pil irmlSgA <Eng swallow Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I swallowed the pills.'
(3.226) ka te
dimida(ri)
(<dimi)
lSgA doorO close Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I closed the door.'
dimi
(3.227) ka te
(<dim)
lSgA doorO close Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I closed the doors.'
erapeyda(ri)
(3.228) ka netat lu
(<erapey)
lSgA one thingO buy Sg/DualO-PfSg
'I bought one thing.'
(<erap)
(3.229) ka lu
erapi
lSgA thingO buy Pauc/PIO-Pf
'I bought things.'
Thus, there is evidence demonstrating a relation between singular I dualO
and verb markers from conjugation 1. Nonetheless, there remains a large corpus
of verbs where the claim is not borne out. Intransitive verbs cannot be carrying
information about the number of 0 as they do not have an 0 argument.
Similarly, there are transitive verbs which can only carry markers from
conjugation type 2, irrespective of the number of 0 involved. The following two
examples illustrate an intransitive and transitive verb from conjugation type 2:
(3.230) newr i
izw- i
(<i ezo)
girlS tear shed-Pf
'The girl cried.'
(<ewer)
(3.231) ka papek iwr- i
lSgA matO weave-Pf
'I wove a mat.'
The generalization can be formulated as follows: Only those verbs from
conjugation 1. express overtly singular/dual number for A or S through their
conjugation markers, i.e. through their morphology (and possibly through their
verb root form). Verbs from conjugation 2. generally have the same lexical root
for all numbers. Thus:
(<ezo)
ba- zw- i
(3.232) newr i
girlS tear PIS-shed-Pf
'The girls cried.'","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"Sociolinguistic Notes.
A special form of the language is used for grieving or expressing sympathy
for an individual. This speech style is called nas+nas rnir 'sorry talk' (lit: sad Adj
word) and only affects verbs by either changing the first vowel to /o/ or /u/ or by
inserting a bilabial glide between the initial consonant and vowel; e.g. dali 'be
Primpf' ---> dwali 'be Prlmpf in sorry talk'; digern 'walk' ---> dogern 'walk in
sorry talk' (see the section in Phonology on glides p. 10).
Whilst all Meryam speakers on Mer can talk some Creole, it is not the case
that all Creole speakers can talk Meryam. For this reason, community affairs are
generally conducted in Creole. For example, when council candidates were
giving their election speech during my stay, only one out of six candidates
delivered their speech in Meryam.
Furthermore, even with Meryam speakers, there is code-switching
depending upon the topic and addressee. In the family home, parents often
address their children in Creole, switching to Meryam when they want to discuss
something which does not concern them. However, many younger people in
their twenties and below, only have a passive knowledge of Meryam and,
consequently, always converse in Creole. It is only speakers in their mid-thirties
and above, with a sufficient grasp of Meryam, who can converse in it.
The language of education is English with Creole used informally in the
classroom for giving instructions or explaining difficult concepts. Meryam is
taught for only half an hour or an hour a week in the school and is funded by the
Commonwealth government.
The Creole spoken on Mer (and on the other Eastern Islands, see Shnukal
1988) does have a high proportion of Meryam lexical items. Similarly, speakers of
Meryam also employ Creole words although the proportion may vary
enormously from speaker to speaker and topic to topic. There are sometimes
preferences for words from a particular language and meanings can differ from
one language to another. For example, the Creole kinship terms sisi 'sister' and
bala 'brother' are used far more frequently than the Meryam term berbet 'sibling'.
An example of semantic shift is the instance of two children from one family
who use Creole terms rnarni 'mummy' and dadi 'daddy' for their parents and the
Meryam terms am.a 'mother' and bab 'father' for their grandparents instead of
the Meryam term kayed or ata for 'grandparent'.
Not all speakers of Meryam have the same command and knowledge of
the language and future research must aim at documenting the range and
differences in forms, functions and meanings comparing conservative Meryam
and Creole.",[16]
"145CHAPTER FOUR
DEICTIC MARKERS4.1.. ,IIIntroduction.
There is a closed class of markers grouped together on a semantic basis as
their meaning is dependent and relative to a place, time, referent or proposition.
They can be regarded as deictic markers because they are 'aspects of the
interpretation of sentences that relate to the speech act situation' (Fillmore, 1975;
8). In Meryam Mir, this is reflected in the choice of marker being determined by
the time at which the event or state happens or is happening relative to the time
of the speech act itself.
It is unclear whether the deictic markers are words or not. They may or may
not carry an accent. Their distribution in the sentence is equally unclear. They
always follow the first element in a sentence and they nearly always occur before
the verb in a clause. They never occur in isolation but always in conjunction
with a verb which suggests they do not have independent grammatical status. In
most examples, the deictic markers can be omitted without altering the
grammatical status although there is obviously a change in meaning. Thus, the
main functional load is on their meaning rather than their syntactic role.
Their status and grammatical function will be discussed following a
description of their forms, features and pragmatic/semantic function. However,
several points should be made before the description:
(i) Examples have been drawn mainly from texts or casual conversation as
elicitation proved to be unsuccessful though desirable for testing certain claims.
One of the consequences of such an approach is that there are major gaps in the
data and not all meanings are contrasted.
(ii) The glosses and free translations reflect the analysis of the researcher rather
than informants' translations as they rarely gave any translation for the markers
other than a spatial meaning and in some of the examples, such a translation was
clearly inadequate.
(iii) A number of features are given for each deictic marker which may prove in
the light of further research to be irrelevant in establishing the contrast between
them. Nonetheless these features have been included to make the treatment of
each marker as extensive as possible.
(iv) There is variation amongst speakers as to the appropriate or suitable marker
to be used. Some speakers actually 'correct' the form of the marker used by
another speaker, which suggests the deictic system is in a state of flux. Speakers
do have choices depending on the perspective they wish to take and particular
features which determine the choice of marker for one speaker may not be the146same prominent features which determine the choice for another speaker. In
other words, a certain amount of variation within the system may be the result of
ongoing changes.
(v) The analysis presented below is by no means final but represents a working
hypothesis based on the current corpus of data. Further study in the area may
result in considerable changes.
In the table on the next page, the deictic markers can be distinguished from
one another on the basis of temporal restrictions and domain of applicability. The
table is an attempt to capture,not function~ but differences and similarities. Note
that the gaps in the system may be because of limited data or because the temporal
reference is too distant from the present and thus distinctions are lost, i.e. there
are no markers for goal and source in the remote past and future. Below is a
summary of the deictic markers' functions..jSummary of Deictic Markers' Functions:

The present deictic markers pe and pa contrast with the non-present
markers ge and ga. Whilst the former can only be used with events or states
which coincide with the speech act utterance or precede it at a time earlier on the
same day, the latter are used with events or states which occur prior to the day or
following the utterance. To illustrate this contrast, consider the examples below.
In 4.1, reference is made to a location marked by the form ge when it is associated
with events or states that occurred a day earlier to the speech act (abgergerge
'yesterday') and by the form pe when it is associated with events that occurred
prior to the speech act (able idimge 'this morning'). Although reference is being
made to the same location, different forms must be used to demonstrate the
different time reference. Similarly, in 4.2, one group of fish caught the previous
day is contrasted with a group of fish caught earlier in the day:

'Yesterday, I climbed up to the garden (and) there I saw many bananas

(Note that the markers that concern us here are not the case inflections suffixed to
nominals which in some cases are homophonous with the deictic markers,
e.g. -ge locative inflection: abgerger-ge 'yesterday-loc'. Those that are deictic
markers are clearly labelled as such. In addition, the reader should not get
confused with verbal deictics and non-verbal deictics. These can be distinguished
from one another on the basis that verbal deictics always occur prefixed to the
verb. The deictic markers in this discussion concern the non-verbal ones.)

should recall that most verb roots themselves, mark number distinctions. There
are three types of verb root: Sg/Dual versus Pauc/Pl, NonPl versus Plural, and
no number distinction. The prefix cross-reference markers are of two types:
Sg/Pl versus Dual/Pauc and, Sg versus NonSg. Because the prefixes and verb
roots have a different number opposition, the maximum distinctions for number
are achieved through a minimum number of forms. This is a highly economical
system of marking.
As verb roots' number distinctions carry predominantly number
information about the S or 0 arguments, it is important that suffixes carry
number information about the A argument; hence there is an extensive crossreference marking system in the suffix position contrasting singular, dual, paucal
and plural. However, as there are verbs which have number information that is
not restricted to a particular argument, it is the combination of markers and verb
roots themselves which achieve specific number distinctions.
3.11Non-Productive Derivations.
There are several morphemes used to signal meanings such as 'similar
type of action', 'transitiviser' and 'word formative'. Several language-internal
reasons contribute to their classification as derivations rather than inflections.
They are only semi-productive, unlike inflections. When they do occur, they
occur in all the forms inflected for tense/ aspect/mood including the 2nd person
future singular - a form of the verb that can be characterised as bearing no
inflection. They are always affixed to the verb root before any inflections and
thus are part of the lexical formation process rather than the syntactic process.
d- 'Similar type of action' Derivation.
There are variations in certain verbal forms differing only in the presence
or absence of an initial consonant Id/. This may simply be a phonemic
alternation not signalling a meaningful relation or it may be a meaningful
morpheme. However, this relation is somewhat obscured at a synchronic level,
possibly the result of diachronic development. The hypothesized morphemedhas no syntactic function in that derived verbs are of the same valency. The
process is not fully productive as not all verbs have the semantic alternation.
Some examples include:
water versus land?:
d-ereb 'dig'
ereb 'punt (a boat)'
land versus water?:
d-igwat 'fish i.e. pull in Pauc/Pl fish'
igwat 'pull, inhale'
d-emarge 'n Pl water vehicle,
emarge 'n Pl land vehicle,
be stationary'
be stationary'139similar type of action?:
etaw(e)rik 'go around something' d-etaw(e)rik 'turn something around'
ewer 'weave'
d-ewer 'build'
kar iruk 'build a fence'
kar d-iruk 'emprison' (lit: fence-erect)
ipit 'hit, kill'
op d-ipit 'meet' (lit: face-hit)
ikris 'scrape, scratch'
lumi d-ikris 'weed' (lit: weed-scrape)
erep 'rub together
d-erep 'mix'
such as for compost'
To characterize the relationship between the different forms as merely
'similar types of action' is inadequate and it would apply to many verbs whose
forms do not have related forms. Furthermore, there are verbal forms where the
same contrast exists phonemically but are obscure semantically, e.g. ikayret 'roast
on fire sg/dualO', and dikayret 'leave'.
i- Transitiviser Derivation.
There is a recurrent root initial vowel /i/ with transitive verbs) that may
correspond to a transitiviser morpheme, although it is not fully productive.
Consider the related pairs:
A=S:
ewtmer 'ask for something'
itmer 'ask someone'
S=O:
akaweret 'n PIS climb on'
ikaweret 'transport Sg/DualO'
ba-tir 'PIS climb on' (<etir 'get out'?)itir 'transport Pauc/PlO'
etrum 'n PIS come down'
itrum 'bring down Sg/DualO'
ewsmer 'Sg/DualS be born'
ismer 'give birth to Sg/DualO'
ews(-os) 'Pauc/PlS be born'
is 'give birth to Pauc/PlO'
espi(r) 'marry to someone, hide'
ispi(r) 'marry, hide something'
edug 'burn'
idug 'cause to burn'
This can only be stated as a tendency rather than a pervasive rule. There
are, for example, many transitive verbs which do not begin with the vowel /i/,
e.g. erap 'break Pauc/PlO'; dayu 'dig for Sg/DualO'. There are also intransitive
verbs which begin with the vowel /i/ and must be considered part of the verb
root, e.g. digem 'walk'; ditimed 'start'; ikarik 'come up to the surface of the
water'; igar 'speak'. There are instances where the transitive form of the verb has
a phonemically-related intransitive form but the relationship between the two
has been obscured or is not. at least to a European, transparent, e.g. ipit 'hit, kill'
(<epit 'blossom, flower'?). There are instances where no phonemically-related
intransitive form of the verb has been collected, e.g. ikris 'scratch, scrape (as in a
coconut)' (<*ekris).","[148, 149, 150, 151]"

There are two possible interpretations for this data. One can either regard
the inflected nominal as the head with the preposed nominal acting like a
modifier, or one could regard the whole phrase as a complex phrase with the case
suffixed to the postposition.
Absent from the noun complex structure presented above is the
phenomenon of compounds which behave like a single complex head noun.
There is no syntactic dependency between the two nouns since modifiers affect
both parts of a complex head noun:

Rules for allomorphy.
na- future 1st person
na- intransitive verbs
a- transitive verbs
If intransitive verb roots begin with (a I di and) an unaccented vowel, these
are deleted when there is the future 1st person marker na-. If transitive verb
roots begin with a I di, it is metathesized with the future 1st person marker a-.
The initial unaccented vowel of transitive verbs is deleted after the future 1st
person marker a-:
For intransitive verb roots:
underlying form: na+ (d)V[-accent] ---> 0 I na[futl] + -- [intr.vb.root]
For transitive verb roots:
underlying form: a + 1. a[futl] + d--- [tr.vb.root] ---> da + -- [tr.vb.root]
2· v[-accentl --> 0 I (d) a [futl] + --(metathesis)(Rule 1. must be ordered before Rule 2.)
ex. na-bakyamu-lu (<bakyamu) 'Futl SgS go'
na-gm-e (<digem) 'Futl SgS walk'
ex. a-marik-lu (<emarik) 'Futl send SgO'111d-a-kayret-lu (<dikayr) 'Futl leave SgO'
wa- (all homophonous forms)
When transitive verbs begin with a front vowel, this vowel is reduced to a
glide following the prefix wa-.
#V[ +front]
-> y I wa + ex. wa-yrap (<erap) 'Fut3 buy';
wa-yrpey (<erpey) 'Fut3 strike';
wa-ysamey (<esam) 'Fut3 put out';
wa-yro (<ero) 'Fut3 eat'
wa-ymri (<imri) 'Fut3 seat';
wa-yspi (<ispi) 'Fut3 marry';
wa-ytuti (<ituti) 'Fut3 touch';
Allomorphic variations for the prefix wa- are as follows:
I - V[-front]
ex. way-atrum 'Fut3 suggest'
wa- ->wayway-omey 'Fut3 grow'
way-urid 'Fut3 PlS be(person)'
(This is the only verb collected beginning with /u/ and it sometimes occurs as
[wa-wrid] i.e. the /y/ glide is being labialized as a result of the back, high vowel
/u/ following or it may be that /u/ of the verb root becomes wafter the prefix
/wa/.)
->wey--wI - V[ +front] (intransitive verbs only)
ex. wey-emri-w-emri 'Fut3 sit down'
wey-espi-w-espi 'Fut3 get married'

'Fut3 give 1/2Sg0'
->waI elsewhere
ex. wa-ditager 'Fut3 tell'
wa-yker (<iker) 'Fut3 do'
An interesting feature of the allomorphic variations of wa- and na- is the
interaction between phonological and syntactically-motivated rules; i.e. with wa-,
the front vowel of a transitive verb is reduced to a glide before the prefix like the
accented vowel of an intransitive verb (See the allomorphs of accented vowels
presented in the section on the verb structure p92). In contrast, an intransitive
verb with a front unaccented vowel is not reduced to a glide.","[121, 122, 123]"

There are two examples in the data of the sequences /wn/ and /wl/ which
might suggest that all consonants can occur with the bilabial glide preceding.
However, both of the examples (and there is only one example of each) are
obvious English loan words:

Judging by the number of examples collected in the data, the frequency of
the lateral plus stop cluster is very low. These clusters (i.e. lateral plus
consonant) may be the result of borrowing as of the eight examples collected, two
refer to names of bananas- a source of potential word loan as different types of
bananas were/ are exchanged, possibly resulting in the name being introduced
into the language from the banana supplier /linguistic group.
The lack of lateral plus voiced alveolar cluster, i.e. /Id/, is probably just a gap.
For the cluster /lk/, only one example was obtained from Ray's dictionary.

look, glance'-> deketi-da Pf, *deketir-da; et6mer- 'show'-> a-t6me-lu FutlSg, *at6mer-lu. This suggests that a distinction needs to be made between verbs and
non-verbs when examining the phonotactic structure of the language.. ii261.5.2 Summary Table of Consonant Clusters.

There is an additional pronominal set which functions both as a reflexive/
reciprocal pronoun and as an 'exclusive' pronoun. In the latter function, it
provides information about the will or high level of involvement of the Sor A,
i.e. A or S exclusively. Its meaning is captured by the following paraphrase: by
oneself, by one's own free will, on one's own. It does have a semantic restriction
in that it must be co-referent with the S or A. The forms themselves are derived
from other pronominal forms:
kababu 'myself, on my own' < ka lSgA/S
kerbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n SgExcl)' < kerbi ln SgExclO
merbibu 'ourselves, on our own (n Sglncl)' < merbi ln SglnclO
mabu 'yourself, on your own (Sg)' <ma 2SgA/S
wabu 'yourself, on your own (n Sg)' < wa 2n SgA/S
tababu 'himself, herself, themselves, on his/her/their own (non)Sg'
< taba(ra) 3Gen
Note that the dual function of this set is parallel to the English pronominal
set with 'self: which can be used for both reflexive/reciprocal events, e.g. I hit
myself, and to mark an exclusive role in the action, e.g. I did it by myself.
Some examples of the two uses follow:

'The woman, herself, saw the ghost.'
(i.e. it was not someone else who saw it)
The two functions are usually kept distinct because when the pronoun is
being used in a syntactic function (i.e. as a reflexive/reciprocal pronoun), the verb
has the intransitiviser prefix ba-. Thus:
(2.256) ma mabu ba- smer-o
2SgS 2SgRefl Intr-see- Fut2/3sg
'See yourself.'
(2.257) ma mabu dasmer-o
2SgA 2SgExcl seeFut2/3sg
'See for yourself.'
However, the language is in a state of flux with many speakers using the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as the only signal for reflexive/reciprocal
actions and reserving the pronoun for the exclusive meaning but with the
intransitivising prefix on the verb as well. Thus:
(2.258) werem ba- mrida
childS Intr-sit down-PfSg
'The child sat himself down.'
(2.259) werem tababu ba- mrida
childS 3Excl Intr-sit down-PfSg
'The child sat himself down on his own.'
What seems to be happening is that the presence of the pronoun is
automatically triggering the intransitive form of the verb irrespective of whether
the action is reflexive/reciprocal or not. This change is probably due to the high
frequency of the two meanings of the pronoun (i.e. as both an exclusive marker
and a reflexive/reciprocal marker).
One can speculate on the origin of this set of pronouns. Ray, in his study
(1907), gives the following set of genitive singular pronouns:
kaba-ra 1SgGen (>modern: kara)
maba-ra 2SgGen (>modern: mara)
taba-ra 3SgGen
(>modern: tabara)
These may have been the source of the roots of the pronominal set
discussed above. Note that the affix -bu that occurs suffixed to the pronouns,
e.g. kababu 'on my own', might be a particle or it might be derived from the
instrumental nominal suffix -u, e.g. bakir-u 'with a stone'. The consonant may
have been inserted because of two vowels occurring across a morpheme
boundary, e.g. kaba+u ---> kaba-b-u. (Consonant insertion is attested elsewhere
with the instrumental case, e.g. lu 'thing'---> lug-u 'with something'.) The
choice of the bilabial stop insertion could have been due to the presence of a71bilabial stop in the root (except for mabu, *mababu which was affixed to maintain
regularity within the paradigm). Thus, these free-standing pronominal forms
might be derived from the instrumental case but whose meaning is to provide
information about the clause as to the volition or the unique participation of the
A/S.
Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns.
There is a set of interrogative words used with non-polar questions such as
nete 'who', netim 'to who, for who', nade 'when, where', nalug-lam 'why, from
what', etc. Within this set are included: nade 'when, where~ which is used to
introduce a temporal or spatial adverbial clause, and nako 'what (to do)~ which is
used to introduce an activity clause. Interrogative words follow a case marking
pattern similar to nouns, an ergative-absolutive pattern, i.e. A versus S/O for
non-humans, and a three way split, i.e. A, S and 0 for humans.
The interrogative/indefinite pronominal paradigm is as follows:
nete 'who'
nalu 'what'
A
net-ide
nalug-ide
s
nalu (... nalulu)
nete
0
neti
Locative
neti-doge

neti-m
nalug-em
Ablative
neti-alam
nalug-lam
Genitive
neti-ra
nalug-ira
Associative
neti-pkem
Instrumental
nalug-u
Some of the interrogative words cannot be broken down into morphemes
and must be listed in the lexicon. These include:
nete 'who'
nade 'when, where'
nako 'what'
Other words are formed by the interrogative proclitic na-. For example:
na-lu 'what' (lit: Q clitic-thing)
na-ged-ge 'where' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-Loe)
na-ged-im (-nagadim) 'where to' (lit: Q clitic-land mass-All)
na-nyay+nyay 'how long (in time)' (lit: Q clitic-time N)
na-war-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-length of time-Loe)
na-kerker-ge 'what time' (lit: Q clitic-point in time-Loe)
na-piri 'how long (in space)' (lit: Q clitic-length)
na-urut-ge 'what year' (lit: Q clitic-year-Loc)72Interrogative pronouns typically occur at the beginning of a sentence or
immediately following a sentence-initial pronoun. Examples to illustrate
interrogatives, their position and their inflections follow:

There is no distinction between A, S or 0 for nonsingular interrogative
pronouns. Thus:
neti-de
'who A (Sg)'
nete
'who S (Sg)'
neti
'who 0 (Sg)'
net-iba

The interrogative pronoun with the ergative plural case marking does not
exist, i.e. *nete-gize. However, the interrogative word formed by the question
clitic and the word le 'person' does have an A plural form and an S plural form
(the plural S form is not acceptable to all speakers):
(2.267) nalelut? (\el\..\t:.1fre~ular-{ormof le.''pef""Son'+et~68A"")

"155(In this example, it is not possible to determine whether the deictic markeris used for a temporal effect or to focus on a different referent.)

'He kept on cutting down light things (wood) (and) throwing them into

(An important point to note from the above example is the use of 3rd person
singular pronoun in the second clause: e-ge ... which does not in fact correlate
with the S/ A of the verb in terms of number, i.e. it is marking plural instead of
singular. One would expect to have a nonsingular pronoun. This might lead one
to suspect that it is not the pronoun being marked by the deictic but the event,
clause or even the whole proposition. More about this will be said shortly.)
The use of the deictic markers to focus or contrast referents is further
exploited to introduce a clause that makes the referent specific, i.e. it is used as a
kind of restrictive relative clause marker. It would be premature to label such
constructions as restrictive relative clauses without having undertaken a full156study of complex sentences and such a study is beyond the scope of this work.
However, such a use should be noted and can be exemplified:

5)pe, ge - focus on different proposition
There are examples where the deictic markers cannot be readily identified as
focussing on specific referents but rather on whole propositions.1 either in the form
of a single predicate proposition or of a multi-predicate proposition.

(Dewmer, p212, section18)6)pe, ge - logical relation
Many of the instances of deictic markers serving to focus on referents or
propositions involve a relation of logical dependency. This logical relation might
be, at the very least, a temporal relation marking a sequence or partial overlap
between one proposition and the previous one (such as in the t.lCatortes quoted
above) but sometimes it indicates a result/ consequence:

Note how the contrast is established between pe and ge in the above
example where direct speech involving events of the 'here' and 'now' or of
earlier on the same day have the form pe whereas events narrated such as
'tell'and belonging to the past are reported by the form ge.

(Dewmer, p208, section4)159It may be that the logical relationship established between two referents orpropositions is the result of inference and not part of the meaning proper of the
deictic markers themselves. This is an area requiring further investigation.
4.2.3 pa,ga
1)pa - relative to present time/ space; ga - relative to nonpresent time/ space
The same temporal distinctions as pe and ge serve to contrast the related
deictic markers pa and ga which can both be defined roughly as having the same
referent or event/state as a previous proposition. The difference between pa and
ga lies in their temporal reference. Pa is restricted to the present, ga to the
nonpresent as defined earlier. Note that the marker pa can include states which
began earlier than the day of the speech act and remain current at the time of the
speech act utterance. The following examples illustrate the time distinctions:

"The Syllable.
The syllable remains inadequately defined in linguistics. Attempts have
been made to<cllTelate it with acoustic and physical properties such as a chest
pulse (Ladefoged, 1975; 220) or by asking the speaker (Ibid; 218). Other attempts
have focussed on the different types found within the phonological or
phonotactic system appealing to features such as onset, nucleus and coda
(Clements and Keyser, 1983; 11) as well as rules generating a set of possible syllabic
types for any given language (Kahn, 1980; 39). None of these approaches prove to
be entirely satisfactory when attempting to isolate just what is a syllable in a
given language.",[29]

The analysis of Meryam Mir vowels remains to be undertaken and what
follows is more of an informal discussion. The high vowels /i,u/ do not sound
like cardinal high vowels and hence have not been placed in the far corners of
the vowel chart but in slightly lower and more central position~ ie. they sound
more like [-1.] and [G> ]. In addition, the high vowels can be said to have neutral lip
articulation for the front vowel /i I and only partial lip-rounding for the back
vowel /u/. Note that the non-high front vowel /e/ is a mid-vowel on the vowel
chart and is articulated somewhere in between [e] and [e:]. The non-high back
vowel /o/ is articulated more like cardinal vowel [J] but as there is no phonemic
contrast between [o] and [J], the symbol /o/ can be used. There is a central vowel
I a/. A full description of the vowels' allophones will not be undertaken in this
study.
There is a non-contrastive length distinction with all vowels tending to be
longer when they occur in accented initial syllable non-monosyllabic
phonological words. For example:
i:tmer 'ask'
i:ter 'sink'
a:kmey 'immerse'
a:bu 'go down'
6:mar 'good feeling'
6:ger 'go up n Prlmpf'
u:t eydi 'go to sleep' (lit: sleep lie)
e:rwer 'teach'
Contrast the above with the following monosyllabic words:
is 'pull out PIO'
14a conjunction
op 'face, front'
ut 'sleep'
ep 'carry SgO'
Parallel to this are words beginning with a consonant which may or may
not be lengthened when the accent is on the first syllable:
ki:kem - kikem 'afternoon'
ta:bo - tabo 'neck'
t-6:ger - t-6ger 'come up n Prlmpf'
Likewise with words in which the accented vowel is followed by a voiced
consonant, the vowel may or may not be lengthened:
ir+i:r 'soupy Adj'
lu gi:z 'ancestor' (lit: thing, tree-trunk, base)
era:r 'tiredness'
i:z 'groper' (compare with is 'take out PIO')
Compare:
dirsir 'prepare'
bar+bar 'crooked'
idim 'morning'
wag-em 'for wind' (lit: wind-All)
purud 'cover, shelter'
og+6g 'dirty'
The generalization can be formulated as follows: Accented vowels in word
initial position for non-monosyllabic words can be lengthened. Elsewhere the
accented vowel can be lengthened when followed by a voiced consonant.
There are several lexical items where the front vowels /i, e/ appear to be in
free alternation in unstressed position. This may be that there is some variation
in their realisation when they do not contrast and consequently there is no risk of
confusion. Hence, the varying orthography between Meryarn and Miryam.
Consider also:
omaskir- omasker 'children'
rnikir-mekir 'almond tree""
kirim-kerim 'head'
kila(r)+kila(r) 'strong'; kelar 'strength'
gilar-gelar 'law'
Nonetheless, one would not want to consider these as a single phoneme as
there are minimal pairs where they do contrast:
gim'illness'
gem'body'
mir 'word, language'
Mer 'Murray Island'
wit 'wrong-doing'
wet 'instrument used for skinning coconuts'15Ii 'faeces'
le 'person'
Furthermore, even when these are unaccented they can contrast:
etkir 'undress Plclothes' itkir 'rub off'
itrum 'bring down'
etrum 'come down'
imri 'seat'
emri 'sit down'1.3Pitch-Accent
Accent is distinctive in the language as words are contrasted according to
the particular syllable on which accent is placed. There are a number of minimal
pairs which contrast solely through accent placement. In the following examples,
the first set of disyllabic words have the accent on the first syllable whilst the
second, set have it on the second syllable:
~V-VV-Vtabo 'snake'
tab6 'neck'
kikem 'afternoon'
kikem 'initially, firstly'
u ni 'coconut juice'
uni 'fish sp.'
dikayr 'wait'
dikayr 'leave alone'
isi 'take out Pauc/PlO perf'
isi 'centipede'
bager 'type of spear'
bader 'PlS land'
What exactly is meant by 'accent'? There is no consensus amongst
linguists who have worked on the language as to what feature or bundle of
features mark the 'accent'. Bartos (1977) refers to the feature as 'stress' but fails to
characterize or define it. McConvell (1983) refers to it as 'pitch-accent' with the
accented syllable being the one carrying high tone/ stress on it. Rigsby (p.c)
maintains that an accented syllable may but need not have high tone.
In the current corpus of data, isolated lexical items collected through
elicitation have the accented syllable bearing high pitch:
umar village name
6mar 'good feeling'
apkorep 'habit, manner'
zyawali 'book'
imiredi 'be sitting Pr'
iperedi 'be lying'
dirsir 'prepare'
dirsi 'be moored'
kepkep 'few'
dobdob 'fat'
datrum 'cut n PlO'
itrum 'bring down'
However, when certain inflections or clitics are added or simply within
discourse, the accented syllable can shift place or the previous accent bearing
syllable will no longer carry high pitch:

Should the definition of accent be altered to include these alternations or
should the definition of accent remain correlated with high tone with details
given elsewhere as to its interaction with other features such as intonation? It
would seem more useful in a descriptive work to keep accent as a discrete
linguistic category specifying elsewhere the alternations.
Accent placement is restricted to the first or second syllable of a
phonological word. Thus, in disyllabic or polysyllabic words, there is a fall in the
pitch following the accented syllable:
ex.
bakyamu
[ - - -]
'Go!'ex.e bakyamu-da
[-ex.","[24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

Pf
*e esk-i
Pf
These examples are illustrative for another reason. The two
morphological categories do not coincide exactly with the semantic categories that
were postulated. Thus, the verb ikasir 'be going along' and the verb esk (< -kos)
'be flowing' are not atelic stative verbs yet behave morphologically with verbs of
this category. There are two possible explanations for these facts. One
explanation is that verbs which are atelic stative in one language such as in
English need not be so in another language such as Meryam Mir. An alternative
explanation is that these categories are essentially morphological categories
which cannot be fully specified on a semantic basis.
3.3Transitive and Intransitive Verbs.
It has been established that a distinction needs to be drawn between atelic
stative and telic active verbs partly on the basis of their morphology and partly on
the basis of semantic criterion. What of the distinction between transitive and
intransitive verbs?
On the basis of arguments which the verbs select, a distinction can be
drawn between transitive and intransitive verbs as the nominals bear A, S or 0
case marking. However, the verbal morphology itself does not cross-reference
strictly on a ergative-absolutive basis nor on a nominative-accusative basis but
rather displays features of both types and some verbs can even employ either type. or
both typesof cross-reference marking.
Consider first a nominative-accusative type cross-reference marking
system. With atelic stative verbs (which are all intransitive verbs), number and,
to some degree, person of the S argument, are marked by means of prefixing:
(3.20) kara
sospan pe da-rakmerkedi
lSgGen <EngS Deix I -3n SgS-1 Sg/DualS be resting upon-Pr
urmeme-ge
fireplace- Loe
'My two saucepans are resting upon the stove.'
Similarly, 0 arguments of transitive verbs are cross-referenced on the verb
by means of prefixing:
(3.21) ka
sospan da-rakmerikda(ri) urmeme-ge
lSgA <EngO I -3n Sg0-1 put resting Sg/DualO upon-PfSg fireplace-Loe
'I put the two saucepans resting upon the stove.'
It should be noted that under certain conditions, namely with the number
hierarchy, the 0 can be cross-referenced for number in the suffix position but86there is specification in the prefix position (at least for 3rd person and for some
verbs with 1/2nd person):
(3.22) ka
yabi da-ratagr-idare
1SgA 3n SgO I -3n Sg0-1 tell- Pauc
'I told them (few).'
With telic active verbs involving intransitive verbs, plural number of the
S argument can be cross-referenced by a prefix:
(3.23) wi
ba- mri
3n SgS PIS-Pauc/PIS sit down-Pf
'They all sat down.'
However, for all other numbers (including plural for some verbs), the S
argument is cross-referenced by a suffix:
(3.24) ki
bakyamu- daryey
ln SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual
'We two (excl) went.'
(3.25) ki
bakyawda
ln SgExclS Pauc/PIS go-PEPI
'We all went.'
Similarly, with telic active verbs involving transitive events, the A
argument is cross-referenced for number by means of a suffix:
(3.26) ki
keriba
lewer erapeydaryey
ln SgExclA ln SgExclGen foodO buy Sg/DualO-PfDual
'We two (excl) bought our food.'
Thus, a correlation can be noted between the cross-reference markers and
the transitivity and type of verb. Prefixes are used for S of atelic stative verbs, 0
arguments and for some plural S of telic active intransitive verbs. Suffixes are
used for A or S arguments of telic active verbs. The first type of cross-referencing
is reminiscent of an absolutive case pattern with Sand 0 receiving the same
marking. The second type of cross-referencing is reminiscent of a nominative
case pattern with Sand A receiving the same marking. Both of these represent
general patterns and within them, the reader should be aware that there are
deviations, i.e. the 0 argument can be marked by a suffix.
McConvell in his study (1983; 44-45) on ergative and verb agreement
reaches a similar conclusion using different but related evidence. His argument
is that the suffix slot on the verb is neither strictly 'ergative' nor 'accusative' as A,
S and 0 arguments can be cross-referenced in this position. The prefix slot,
however, is clearly 'ergative' in its operation, only being filled by 0 arguments or
by A/S 1st or 3rd person future markers (although he did not have examples of
atelic stative verbs which do have S arguments cross-referenced in the prefix slot
irrespective of tense).","[96, 97, 98]"
