"289align, how can we still group them together as the Subject of the language? Again, which
coding property is relevant for characterizing the Subject of a language?
According to Givén (1997:29), behavior-and-control properties would reflect
grammatical relations more faithfully than morphology, because they are more directly
motivated by pragmatic factors, while morphology is not: “Being the most
grammaticalized, ritualized or automated feature in grammar, morphology has a higher
potential for dissociation from semantic or pragmatic function, in this case the topicality
function of subjects and objects”.
Givén also points out that the Subjects of the languages of the world can present
different degrees of grammaticalization: “...languages with fewer subject properties have
a less prototypical - less grammaticalized - subject.” (Givon, 1997:29). In other words, a
Subject that is very grammaticalized exhibits properties in all levels: case marking, word
order, syntactic behavior, etc.. When the Subject of a language is little grammaticalized, it
exhibits few properties, most likely in the syntactic behavior-and-control (which is more
directly influenced by pragmatic factors) and less likely in the morphology.
Thus, for an Ergative language, the coding device that “least safely” leads us to
identify the category of Subject is the morphology, and that behavior-and-control
properties can be more helpful. However, even in this case we need to be careful, because
the Subject of the language under study may be little grammaticalized and may therefore
not show many properties even at the syntactic level.","[316, 317]"
"As we can see, in Trumai we do not have reasons to group {S,A} together as the
category of Subject, and to say that the Subject of this language is actually the grouping
{S,O} is not a good solution either. The same can be said with regard to the category of
Object: there are no reasons to group O and the DAT argument of Extended Intransitive
verbs together, given their differences in case-marking (O is marked by -9, DAT by -#l, ki, -s), word order (O is preverbal, DAT follows the VP), and syntactic behavior (O aligns
with S rather than with DAT).",[323]
"6.1. Review of declarative clausesIn this section, the issue of word order will be addressed, in order to give us a
better idea of the differences and similarities between declarative and negative clauses (as
we will see, negative clauses can present variations in word order for the purpose of
narrowing the scope of negation).
As mentioned in chapter 5, simple declarative clauses can have verbal or nonverbal predicates. For clauses with verbal predicates, the basic or unmarked word orders229are [S V (DAT)] and [A O V (DAT)]. Variations in the order are possible when a specificpiece of information needs to be highlighted. The piece of information — which is a
constituent - comes in the first position of the clause, and can be followed by the
Focus/Tense particle ka_in or chi_in (actually, the fronting of the constituent seems to bethe important step for the highlighting). If the constituent being highlighted is a NP, extra
verbal morphology may be necessary, depending on its grammatical role (i.e. if it is an
Absolutive NP).
For clauses with non-verbal predicates (i.e. nominal, equative, locative,
existential), there are two possible word orders, [Pred Subj (Cop)] and [Subj (Cop) Pred],depending on pragmatic factors, that is, which piece of information needs to be
highlighted. A Focus/Tense particle in general is used after the element under focus,
although it is not always employed (again, the fronting of the information seems to be the
important factor). The presence of the Copula chi‘ is often attested for nominal and
equative predicates, but is not always required, especially with 3rd. person subjects (for
nominal predicates, when the order is Subj Pred, the copula is present). Locative and
Existential predicates almost do not employ the Copula chi. Only the order [Pred Subj] is
possible for existential predicates.
Attributive predicates can present two orders, one nominal (Pred Subj Cop),
another verbal(Subj Pred), and so far there is no reason to consider one more basic thanthe other. Their use probably indicates different nuances in the semantics of the clause.
This is the overall scenario with regard to simple declarative clauses. Now, let us
see how clauses are configured in other kinds of modalities.","[256, 257]"
"Given that S and O align in many ways, what should we conclude? Should we say
that the Subject in Trumai is the grouping {S,O}? There are problems with this position
as well:
(i) as already mentioned, the O argument is prototypically a patient, while S is an agent. If
we group S and O together, what is the category Subject in Trumai after all?
Semantically, S and O are different; they do not share a common role.
And if we say that O is the Subject (i.e. the primary topic) of a clause, what is then
the A argument? The Object (i.e. the secondary topic)? In this case, we would have a
language in which O is always codified as being more topical than A, even though Aisagent, a very salient participant of the event, and a strong candidate to be the primary
topic of any Transitive clause. As we see, it is problematic to say that O is the Subject of
a clause. Even if we say that A is not the Object, but rather an ‘Oblique’, there will becomplications (cf. item (iii)). Another problem is that the suppression of the S argument
in a clause produces semantic effects that are different from the suppression of the O
argument (cf. chapter 9, section 9.1.1). This being so, how much sense does it make to294group S and O together as the ‘Subject’ of this language? To us, it seems that to group S
and O as the Subject category of Trumai is to let the formal criteria override semantic and
pragmatic factors that are also important.(ii) to say that the grouping {S,O} is the Subject in Trumai forces the language to satisfy
the necessity of having grammatical relations. Is really necessary to talk about Subject or
Object in order to describe the Trumai grammar? No. We can describe the system and the
syntax of the language only on the basis of the argument types (Absolutive, Ergative,
Dative) that are found in a clause. The use of the labels introduced in section 7.1.1. is alsoenough to describe the Trumai grammar;(iii) one could suggest that in a clause with A and O arguments, the O argument (the NPpatient, marked by -¢) is the Subject, and the A argument (the NP-agent, marked by -k) is
actually an ‘Oblique’. Thus, a clause with a verb such as mapa ‘break’ would have the
following configuration:
AgentPatientNP-kNP-¢Vv>AgentPatient‘Oblique’SubjectVin other words, the clause would have a passive voice configuration, with the patient
marked as Subject (the primary clausal topic) and the agent marked as ‘Oblique’ (a
peripheral function). An important detail here is that this “passive” clause has no active
counterpart, in which the NP-agent would be codified as Subject (primary topic) and the
NP-patient would be codified as Object (secondary topic). There is obviously a problem295with this analysis. It is strange that a language would have “passive” clauses without
having active ones, considering that the passive voice is cross-linguistically more
restricted in discourse (this kind of voice is generally used for special purposes, such as
demoting the agent and promoting the patient to primary topic). Therefore, to say that {O,
S} (the Absolutive) is the Subject category of Trumai does not help us to understand the
system of the language; on the contrary, it leads us to characterize it in a strange way;(iv) one could say that the grouping {S,O} would be the Subject category in Trumai
because, according to the coding properties presented above, every sentence has a
Subject, and in Trumai the Absolutive is always present in a clause. However, this is not
exactly true. The Absolutive argument in Trumai occurs in all clause types, that is, the
canonical Intransitive and Transitive clauses. However, not every individual clause
necessarily has an Absolutive mark. Sometimes the Absolutive argument is suppressed
because of pragmatic reasons (cf. chapter 9 on voice).","[321, 322, 323]"
"310on the hierarchy. Therefore, the motivation for the marking of the causee would merely
formal: the causee would receive the marking on the hierarchy that is available to it.
Comrie observes that some languages allow doubling on one of the positions in
the hierarchy (i.e. in some languages, in the causative of a Transitive verb the causee can
be marked as Accusative, resulting in a construction with two Accusatives). However, the
doubling respects the patterns observed elsewhere in the language (that is, doubling on
object would be possible for a language that allows other clauses to have two Accusative
objects). According to Comrie, the possibilities for doubling of a specific grammatical
relation would depend on its position in the hierarchy: the lower the position, the higher
the possibilities of doubling. As he points out (Comrie 1989:178), “doubling on subjects
is unknown in causative constructions; doubling on direct objects is attested, but
restricted; doubling on indirect object is very widespread”.
Considering Comrie’s ideas, the causative construction in Trumai would represent
a complicated case. If we consider the characteristics of the morpheme ka, we cannot call
the Trumai causative construction analytical, since ka is not a verb (it does not present
verbal properties). Thus, we would have to say that the Trumai causative construction is
morphological rather than analytical. However, if we say this, there will be problems. As
shown above, in the causativization of Transitive verbs, the NP-causee is marked asErgative, as well as the NP-causer. If the causative construction in Trumai involves only
one verb, then we have doubling on “subjects” in the construction; > that is, we have two> We are using the term ‘subject’ here in order to relate our discussion to the observation made by Comrie,
who uses this term in his work. However, to be more precise, what we have in the Trumai causativeconstruction is doubling on the A argument.","[337, 338]"
"Trumai has rich syntax, although word order can change because of pragmatic
factors. The case-system shows an Ergative-Absolutive alignment. With regard to
grammatical relations, the traditional relations of ‘Subject’, ‘Object’, and ‘Indirect
Object’ do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. The case-marking system and the
syntax of the language consistently identify three argument types: Absolutive, Ergative,
and Dative; each type contains a subset of the traditional relations.
Other interesting facts observed in Trumai: (i) when a Transitive verb iscausativized, both the causer and the causee are marked as Ergative; (11) the main strategy
for voice manipulation is argument suppression; (iii) there is a construction that could be
classified as an instance of “possessor ascension”; (iv) the verb of a complement clause
behaves as an inalienably possessed noun (more specifically, as a body part term); (v)
there are multiple types of negative clauses in Trumai.","[5, 6]"
"296Again, we have the question: why do we need the traditional grammatical
relationships of Subject, Object, etc., to talk about Trumai? We do not. For the purpose of
describing the grammar of this language, such relations are not necessary. They would be
interesting for the purpose of doing typological studies, that is, if we want to compare
Trumai to other languages of the world. However, there is not much to say about the
category of Subject in Trumai. If we consider Givon’s idea that a language with few
subject properties has only a slightly grammaticalized subject, then we can say that the
grouping {S,A} could be considered the Subject of Trumai, but it would be a Subject in
the very first steps to grammaticalization. It may be showing its first manifestations in the
control of anaphoric elements, as examples (79-81) above suggest, but there are still
tremendous limitations. Perhaps in future research, careful analysis of texts can bring to
light facts that help us to better define a category of Subject for Trumai.
The relationship among the obligatory arguments types of Trumai may be better
understood if we do not talk about them in terms of Subject, Object, Indirect Object, but
rather if we talk in terms of ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments. In the next section, we
present an alternative way of analyzing this relationship.","[323, 324]"
"287According to Givén (1984:138), Subject would be the grammaticalized
discursive-pragmatic role of topic; that is, Subject would be the codification of the
primary clausal topic, while Object would be the codification of the secondary clausal
topic.
The codification of the primary clausal topic - the Subject - is done through
several devices, such as word order, verb agreement, nominal case-morphology, etc.
Looking at these coding devices, we could identify the category of Subject in a specific
language.
Among the coding devices proposed by Keenan (1976), we have:
eword ordereverb agreement (i.e. the Subject controls person-marking on the verb)enominal case-morphology (in general, the Subject receives the unmarked case)ebehavior-and-control properties (such as control of coreference; reflexivization;
control of coreference in relativization, etc.)eindispensability (the Subject is the NP necessarily present in a clause. All clauses
have a Subject)eagentivity (the agent often is the topical participant)eaddressee phrase of the Imperative constructionThe coding properties presented above work very well for identifying the Subject
of languages whose case system is Nominative-Accusative. For these languages, the
properties coincide in a way that results in a coherent notion of Subject: S and A, which
are “‘...the NPs which refer to functions that can be the initiating/controlling agents”288(Dixon 1994:124-125), aligned both in morphology and in syntax. Therefore, for these
languages, Subject would be the grouping {S, A}.
The scenario is more complex when we use the same properties for identifying the
Subject of languages whose case system is Ergative-Absolutive, because the
morphological properties and the behavior-and-control properties can conflict. Many
languages are Ergative in the morphology (with S and O aligning), but their syntax works
on a Nominative-Accusative basis (i.e. for syntactic operations, S and A align). Then,
how do we define the category of Subject for these languages? Which coding property is
more crucial for characterizing their Subject?
Other Ergative languages have a consistent system, being Ergative-Absolutive
both in morphology and syntax (these languages have “deep ergativity”). For languages of
this type, some authors propose that the Absolutive NP would be the Subject; Keenan
(1976) suggests this with regard to Dyirbal. Dixon (1994:112) does not agree with this
analysis, because if the Absolutive is the Subject, then the category of Subject in Dyirbal
would be the grouping {S,O}; however, there are semantic differences between S and O.
The grouping {S,A} as ‘Subject’ is understandable because, as Dixon points out, S and A
refer to functions that can be the agent. In contrast, the grouping {S,O} as ‘Subject’ is
problematic because O is not semantically an agent, it is a patient.'* Therefore, to say that
the Absolutive is the Subject of a language with deep ergativity - such as Dyirbal - may
not be the best analysis. However, if in a language with deep ergativity S and A do not‘4 The discussion presented here is especially concerned about clauses in the active voice. If we have a
Transitive clause with two arguments, A and O, which one will be the ‘Subject’ of the clause?","[314, 315, 316]"

the use of tao represents an alternative way of expressing causative events, making
explicit how the causing event is brought about (i.e. through an order).
Now, bringing theoretical considerations to our study, how can we analyze the
causative construction in Trumai? First, let us see the approach proposed by Comrie. As
Comrie (1989:166-167) points out, languages can exhibit analytical or morphological/
synthetic causative constructions. The analytic causative has two verbs, one expressing
the predicate of causation, the other expressing the effect; causative constructions of this
type involve the use of verbs such as cause, make, etc. The morphological/synthetic309causative has one verb, and special morphology relates the causative predicate to the noncausative one.
The marking of the causee in morphological causatives is an important issue
for Comrie, especially when a Transitive verb is causativized. Given that inmorphological causatives there is only one verb, and that the introduction of the causer
brings one more participant to the event, the valency of the verb has to rearranged
(theoretically, analytical causatives would not have this problem, because there are two
verbs in the construction, and each verb would have its own set of arguments).*
According to Comrie (1989:175), “cross-linguistically, this problem of valency
increase is almost invariably solved by altering the expression of the causee”. In many
languages, when a Transitive verb is causativized, the causer is marked as subject and the
causee (the original subject) is marked indirect object (Dative) or Instrumental; in some
languages, the causee can be marked as object (Accusative). What would not be
observable in languages of the world is the marking of the causee as subject, because then
the causativized verb would have two subjects.
To account for the marking of the causee observed in the languages of the world,
Comrie proposes a hierarchy of grammatical relations: Subject > Direct Object > Indirect
Object > Other Oblique. His idea is that after all the other participants have been assigned
cases from the beginning of the hierarchy, the causee would receive the next case down4 “The morphological causative normally has a valency one higher than that of the corresponding noncausative, since in addition to the arguments of that non-causative predicate there is also the causer. With
analytic causatives this introduces no problems, since each of the two predicates, expressing cause and
effect, retains it own set of arguments” (Comrie, 1989:175).","[335, 336, 337]"
"254CHAPTER 7Case-Marking Alignment
and Grammatical RelationsIn this chapter, the case system of Trumai is described. The alignments observed
in the data show that this language has an Ergative-Absolutive system, and that there are
four verb classes in Trumai. This language has three kinds of obligatory arguments
(Ergative, Absolutive, Dative) and these argument types are very important in describing
the system of the language. The traditional grammatical relations (Subject, Object,
Indirect Object) do not play a central role in Trumai grammar. There are no syntactic
behaviors that support establishing a cross-cutting category of either ‘Subject’ (grouping
A and S) or ‘Object’ (grouping O and DAT). It seems that this language works on the
basis of another principle: ‘Core’ versus ‘Peripheral’ arguments, with different degrees of
core/peripheriality.
Section 7.1. presents the clause types and the verbal classes found in Trumai, with
characterization of the case system. There is a special discussion with regard to one
verbal class, the Extended Intransitive verbs (section 7.1.3).","[281, 282]"
"311A arguments for the same verb. In no other construction in Trumai a single verb can have
two A arguments.
One could suggest that ka can still be considered a verb, just like tao ‘order/give
order’ is; in this case, one Ergative NP (the causer) would be an argument of ka, while the
other Ergative NP (the causee) would be an argument of the causativized verb. However,if ka does not present verbal properties, how can we can call it a verb? If we say that ka is
a main Transitive verb (like rao), it would be a very strange kind of verb. Therefore, the
“solution” of classifying the Trumai causative construction as analytical does not present
any advantage; it only forces an inappropriate analysis onto the Trumai data in order to
preserve a typological claim.
In any case, the Trumai causative construction with Transitive verbs is
problematic for Comrie’s approach:
1.if we say that the Ergative marking marks Transitive subjects in Trumai, then the
causative construction of this language clearly violates his hierarchy;2.if we say that the Ergative marking does not mark Transitive subjects, we still cannot
explain the doubling on A: if the marking of the causee is formally motivated, why is
the causee in the causative of Transitive verbs marked as Ergative? Why not as
Dative, since doubling on Dative is observed in other parts of the language (cf.
example (78) in chapter 7), while doubling on Ergative with the same verb is not?","[338, 339]"
"203If the clause has a verbal-predicate configuration, the predicate always indicates
temporary states, in both negative and affirmative modalities. However, in the negative
modality, the use of the verbal negator tak is allowed only with the word order [Adj tak
Subj Cop]. As already explained in the previous section, verbal predicates can also
present this word order when in the negative modality, but this construction is not the
typical one, since it is a “blend” of nominal and verbal predicates (it has the Copula and
nominal word order, but the verbal negator). However, that is the only order allowed with
attributive predicates if the negator is tak.

predicates, the negator used is anuk, the same used for nouns. This is again a “blend” of
the characteristics of nominal and verbal predicates (now, we have verbal word order, butthe nominal negator): Subj Adj anuk.","[228, 229]"
"7.3.1. Traditional eramatical relationships (‘Subject’, ‘Object’. etc)We begin our discussion about grammatical relationships in Trumai with a
citation from Dixon (1994:11): “Turning our attention now to syntax, we can first of all
note the confusion concerning the identity of the ‘subject’ in ergative languages”. That is
indeed a complicated issue. In the linguistic literature, several authors have discussed the
notion of Subject, such as Keenan (1976), Comrie (1989), Li (1976), Dixon (1994), and
Givon (1984, 1997), among others. There is some controversy about how to defineSubject, especially with regard to the Subject of Ergative languages; we will see why.",[314]
"The morpheme iets’ comes after the VP, if the clause is the typical verbal
predicate order (111-112), or after the verb/predicate, if the word order is not verbal (113115):(11)hi watkan[hi ao-k[hiisit’ke]iets’].",[431]
"Looking at the patterns presented above, we can see that there is only one way of
expressing permanent characteristics, but two ways of expressing temporary states.
Attributive predicates that indicate permanent characteristics are probably simple nominal
predicates, with the adjective nominalized by ke behaving in the same way as nouns. The205question is to understand the nature of the attributive predicates that indicate temporary
states. Let us first realign them strictly on the basis of word order:
affirmative:
negative:Adj
Subj (Cop)
Adj tak Subj (Cop)Subj Adj
Subj Adj anukLooking at the negative modality, we observe that when the order is nominal, the
negator is verbal, and conversely, when the order is verbal, the negator is nominal. In
other words, the negator has always opposite “polarity” in relation to the word order.
However, a problem remains: what are the semantic differences between the two
ways of expressing temporary states? So far, the only difference that could be detected
was due to pragmatic factors: the Subj Adj or Adj Subj (Cop) order is selected depending
on which information the speaker wants to highlight:
(83)kafe
coffeeyi
YIsupi.
bitter‘The coffee is bitter.” (comment)(84)supika_inkafeyi.bitter Foc/Tens coffee YI
‘The coffee is bitter (new info).’ (answer to the question: Is the coffee sweet?)In sum, it seems that the more adequate way of understanding attributive
predicates in Trumai is to take into account whether the attribute being expressed is
permanent or temporary. If permanent, we have a nominalized adjective in a nominal
predicate and no further complications. If temporary, we have a “hybrid” predicate, with
two possibilities: (i) nominal syntax but not-nominal nucleus (and consequently, notnominal Negation particle); (ii) verbal syntax but not-verbal nucleus and not-verbal206Negation particle. We could go deeper into this issue and explore the nature of adjectives
in general. As some scholars point out, adjectives refer to entities that are more timestable than verbs, but less than nouns (Givén 1984). This being so, it is not surprising that
in some languages adjectives shows properties of both nouns and verbs, since they
constitute an in-between category. Perhaps the temporal attributive predicates in Trumai
play along with this in-between nature, oscillating between nominal (permanent) or verbal
(temporary) characteristics. Could we say that an attributive temporal predicate with
nominal syntax indicates a slightly less temporary attribute than one with verbal syntax?
Or is the choice of a nominal or verbal syntax conditioned only by the same pragmatic
factors which condition order changes in verbal predicates? This remains a point for
further research.","[230, 231, 232]"
"184In order to discuss such questions, this section will offer a view of the possible
historical developments in Trumai that would be the origin of the facts observed in the
contemporary language. The historical approach offered here is based on internal
reconstruction (taking into consideration some patterns observed in the language) and on
parallel developments observed in other languages of the world, which makes the
historical development presented here more plausible, because such developments are
already attested. The historical approach that is being proposed is not a tool to analyze the
synchronic data, it is just a way of understanding where the patterns came from.
We observe that there is correlation of word order between [SV] - [OV] and thepossessive construction:
NP possessorNPpossessed«>SV/ OVThis correlation is not mere coincidence. SV and OV probably came from
nominalizations of verbs used in cleft constructions that eventually became main clauses.
The Focus/Tense particles probably arose from clefts too. We are proposing these facts
because: (1) it is already attested in the development of some languages that clefts can
replace main clauses (cf. Heine & Reh 1984); (2) traditionally, cleft sentences involve theisolation of an argument (in order to be highlighted), the presence of a Copula, and a verb
undergoing nominalization or relativization. This configuration is very similar to the
scenario we have in Trumai.
In previous stages of Trumai, S and O would be originally the possessor of the
nominalized verb used in the cleft (e.g. the monkey’s scream; the construction ofthehouse). Later the nominalizations were reanalyzed as verbs in the infinitive and the NPs185that were with them were reinterpreted as their arguments.” A and DAT probably were
obliques (i.e. they were extra NPs) reinterpreted as Ergative and Dative NPs, respectively.
So, we would have something like:
> The monkey screams.","[209, 210, 211]"
"IYI-3Abs‘It (something) is not water’{not existential meaning]6.3.3. Negation in possessive predicatesThe Negation particle tak is used for both inalienable and alienable possessive
predicates, negating the verb. In the case of alienable possession, the negator modifies
k’ad ‘to have’. In the case of inalienable possession, the negator tak modifies the
nominal root that indicates the possessed entity (and that behaves as the verb of the
clause; cf. section 5.2.6). For instance:(56)sapaun

arm Neg[alienable]ka_in
hachi.
Foc/Tens 1 Cop‘I do not have arms.’[inalienable]The alienable possessive predicate has an alternative way of expressing negative
sense, through the use of the postposition nik:

ka_in = hachi.
salt without Foc/Tens 1 Cop
‘I do not have salt.’The inalienable possessive predicate also has an alternative way of expressing
negative sense, through the use of the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’. Although it is not clear as
yet, the use of t(a)ke here seems to imply that the subject has never possessed the object
in question. For instance, (60) probably means that the speaker has never had a sister, as243opposed to a person who does not have a sister because she died. We raise this hypothesis
on the basis of other occurrences of t(a)ke, where the sense of ‘never’ is evoked.
However, the semantics of example (60) need to be rechecked, in order to confirm ordisconfirm our hypothesis.

they can present both nominal and verbal-predicate word orders (i.e., Adj Subj(Cop)orSubj Adj), and also because when in the negative modality, they have the negator tak
occurring with the nominal order, while anuk occurs with the verbal one; in other words,
the opposite scenario observed in nominal and verbal predicates. For example:

‘Iam not curved.’ (temporary)
(62)hanacha anuk.
1 curved Neg
‘Tam not curved.’ (temporary)Attributive predicates also have alternative ways for expressing a negative sense.
Like verbal predicates, they can use t(a)ke ‘Privative’, and like nominal predicates, they
can employ the morpheme n(i)kik:244(63)nacha-nkikka_inha chi.curvedFoc/Tens1Cop‘I am not curved.’

"3.actually, as discussed in chapter 7, we cannot talk about the traditional grammatical
relations of ‘Subject’ or ‘Object’ for Trumai, given that there are no syntactic
behaviors to support establishing these categories. Therefore, the marking of the312causee in the causative constructions in Trumai cannot be accounted for withComrie’s hierarchy, since the traditional grammatical relations do not play a role in
the grammar of this language.","[339, 340]"
"In the case of nominal predicates, no changes are necessary from the normal word
order, Pred Subj Cop. The scenario is different in the case of verbal predicates, because
the order now is changed, becoming the same as nominal predicates. More interesting,
now the Copula also occurs, and a morpheme ke appears after the verb. For example:

'S As already mentioned in chapter 2 (footnote 11), the order [S V] is based on clauses with Intransitive
verbs, since the presence of only one argument makes it easier to analyze the organization of the clause. We
use Intransitive clauses as the basis for the comparison, but the facts presented here (i.e. position of enclitic;
word for negation) are also valid for Extended Intransitive and (Extended) Transitive clauses. Whennecessary, we present information on these kinds of clauses too.
'S Nominal predicates can also present an alternative order (Subj Cop Pred), depending on pragmatic
factors:

b. ha chi

Foc/Tenstsi-tle.
3Poss-mother.",[220]
"Foc/Tens217The possession of alienable entities involves a special kind of clause: the word
k’ad, which literally means ‘hand’, behaves as the verb of the clause (and probably means
‘to have’ here), and both the NP-possessor and the NP-possessed occur in the Absolutive
case, which is a pattern completely different from those observed elsewhere in the
language.’ In a verbal predicate, when one of the NPs is in the absolutive case, the others
are in the ergative, dative or remaining cases. However, here two NPs are both in the
Absolutive; case marking is not allowed in the NP-possessed (examples 123b-c). In this
case, how do we distinguish the possessor from the possessed? The possessor is the NP
that comes right before the verb k’ad (120), or right before the copula when there are
changes in the word order (121). When the possessor is not lexically realized, the 3Abs
enclitic occurs on the verb k’ad (example 122). As we can see, the possessor has thesyntactic attributes of an S argument (cf. chapter 7). Examples:
(120)(121)tahu ka_in
ha k’ad.

knife[possessor marked in the verb k’ad]27 Given that the verb k’ad probably came from the noun k’ad ‘hand’, we could imagine that the
construction perhaps has evolved from something like [my hand is in/with a knife] to [I hold a knife] and
finally [I have a knife]. Later, the possessive pronoun for ‘my’ was probably reanalyzed as a subject
personal pronoun ‘I’, and the word for ‘hand’ was reanalyzed as verb (probably following the path:
grasp/hold> have; the common evolution observed in some languages is hand>grasp>hold>have, like in
French). This is merely speculation, since there is no direct evidence for this hypothesis, but the evolution
grasp>have is widely attested cross-linguistically, and the connection between ‘hand’ and ‘grasp’ should be
uncontroversial.","[242, 243]"
"O occurs preverbally, otherwise ke appears after the verb. A comes before the VP,
but it can change order without special morphology after the verb. DAT comes after the

DATThere is one more clause type observed in Trumai. This type is required for verbs
such as fa ‘hit/kill’, sone ‘drink, chuda ‘make’, etc. It presents two arguments, one agent-like, another patient-like. The agent-like argument aligns with S in terms of case-markingand word order/constituency behavior. The patient-like argument aligns with the DAT261argument of Ditransitive verbs. We call this clause type Extended Intransitive, a termused by Dixon (1994).
IV. Type 4 (Extended Intransitive clause): the agent argument is marked by -g; the
patient-like argument is marked by -(V)dl, -ki, or -(V)s. If the agent-NP is lexically absent
because of discourse continuity, the last element of the VP receives the 3rd person
enclitic -n/-e. The absence of the patient-like arguments does not require special marking
on the verb.","[287, 288, 289]"
"3.3.4. Imperative ParticlesThere are three particles in Trumai for the expression of the Imperative mood with
verbal predicates: wana, which occurs with (Extended) Intransitive verbs; waki, which
occurs with (Extended) Transitive verbs when Ois inanimate; and wa, which occur withTransitive verbs when O is animate. When the verb is Transitive but O is coreferential
with the executor of the event (i.e. reflexive), then the particle used is wana.
These particles precede the verb, and when a DAT argument is also included in
the imperative construction, it has to either precede the particle or follow the verb, but it7 It is interesting to observe that attributive predicates also allow the presence of the relativizer ke after the
Focus/Tense particle ka_in (cf. chapter 2). However, the attributive predicate has the word order{ Pred ka_in ke Subj Cop], while here the word order is [Causer ka_in ke Causee O V Particle]. In other
words, there is a parallelism with regard the placement of ke, but that is the only similarity between
attributive predicates and the causative construction with constrative focus on the causer.",[137]

NP is the causer, which one is the causee on the basis of the position that the NPs occupy
in the construction, but the ideal scenario would be that the marking of the causer and the
causee were completely different, in order to avoid the risk of ambiguity with regard to
the role of each NP. This is what is observed in many languages: in the typological
literature, there are many examples of languages where the causee is marked as Dative or
Instrumental, while the causer has a different marker. Thus, the causative construction in304Trumai does not present the ideal situation, where all the relations are clearly stated;° that
is, although Trumai is a case-marking language, it uses word order (rather than casemarking) to disambiguate causer and causee. That makes the construction unusual
typologically.
We observe that speakers try to avoid the presence of two Ergative NPs in the
construction if the information can be inferred from the context, or it does not matter who
the causee is:

order is possible.* The Copula in general is not used, while the presence of the
Focus/Tense particle is highly frequent. As we can see, there are many overlaps between
the characteristics of existential predicates and the locative/nominal ones. Thus,

locative/nominal predicate. The existential reading is preferred depending on the

"5.2.5. Other kinds of non-verbal predicateIn this section, we will consider the other possible kinds of predicate that are not

order is Pred Subj and the use of the Copula is frequent. However, each of these
predicates has its own peculiarities that differentiate them from prototypical nominal
predicates and from each other. The following table presents the main similarities and
differences among these predicates (for the comparison, we are excluding the Copula,

eEquative:
Like nominal predicates, Equative predicates have the order Pred Subj but,depending on pragmatic factors, they can also present the order Subj Pred. The presence
of the Copula is not obligatory with 3rd person, but if used, it is always following the
Subject, despite the variations in the order:”°

but the use of the morpheme n(i)kik is preferred by the consultants (cf. chapter 6 foranalysis of this morpheme). We do not have examples with anuk in the order Subj Pred,3 Actually, when the order is [Subj Cop Pred], the copula is conserved in nominal predicates. In equative

of them are preposed to the main clause, others are postposed.
Adverbial clauses are different from simple independent clauses because they all
have extra morphology at the end of the VP or at the end of the clause (when the word
order is not verbal). This morphology can be a bound morpheme (such as -is/-es, in the
Temporal/Conditional clauses, or -ak in the Causal/Reason clauses), or a free morpheme

are not simple Intransitive verbs because they have an obligatory second argument;
however, they cannot be called Transitive, because their morphosyntax is different from
that observed with Transitive verbs and because their second argument is clearly marked
as Dative.
Additional evidence that these verbs are basically Intransitive is the kind of
particle that they require in the Imperative construction. The use of the Imperative
particles shows that Extended Intransitive and Intransitive verbs are of the same type,
while Ditransitive verbs align with Transitive verbs:

‘If the daughter of my uncle likes me, I will (perhaps) get married.’Thompson and Longacre (1985:193) point out that in many languages there is no
distinction between temporal (‘when’) clauses and conditional (‘if’) clauses. As they say,“the distinction between when and if clauses is simply one of degree of expectability,
and is a distinction which many languages do not code.”
As already said, the Temporal subordinate clause comes at the first position of thesentence. Sometimes the order can be changed, if the event in the main clause happened!2 With regard to the kinds of unreality conditional that Thompson and Longacre mention (“imaginative
unreal’, which refers to a situation that might happen or might have happened; ‘predictive unreal’, which
refers to a situation that we predict will happen), we need more research. Our hypothesis is that the
difference between the imaginative unreal and the predictive real may be expressed through the use of the
adverb men ‘frustratively’; that is, we imagine that the imaginative unreal conditional will have this adverb,
because often it is the case that the clauses in which men occurs refer to unreal or counterfactual situations
(cf. examples in chapter 3, section 3.4).
° Notice that the marker used in this example is -is, not -s, which is not accepted here (the subordinate
clause presents a non verbal word order):
*pech pata tak afiawn yi-s, ayey de hat’ke chikida tak.

"Cop-3AbsThen a question arises: can the order between ke and tak be reversed, in order to
negate not only the verb, but the whole predicate? The answer is no. The negator tak is
used if we negate the verb itself, that is, if we want to negate the nucleus of the predicate.
If we want to negate the predicate as a whole, then the Negation particle used is anuk,
which typically negates nominal predicates, as illustrated above:(75)Vv

‘I do not kill jaguars (habitually).’200In all of the examples given above, the clauses have the structure of a cleft
construction: the verb is isolated in first position in order to be highlighted, it undergoes
relativization, and the Copula is present.”! So, example (68a), which is an answer to the
question ‘Do you work?’, could be interpreted as: ‘Yes, I am one who works’. The use of
the negator anuk in example (75) suggests that the verb is relativized. Therefore, one
possible analysis would be to say that all the examples above are instances of cleft
constructions with focus on the verb/predicate.
However, this analysis cannot explain one syntactic property of these
constructions: when the negator tak directly modifies the verb (example (74)), kebecomes optional. It would be strange for a cleft construction to optionally relativize the
verb. Another problem with analyzing all of (68-69b), (74), and (75) as instances of cleftsis that this construction occurs more frequently than we would expect for a cleft.
Basically, these clauses are the usual way of answering a yes/no question about a habitual
event.
There is one more problematic point in saying that these examples are instances of
cleft: how can we account for a clause with a Transitive verb - such as the example below
- where the “subject” of the “nominal predicate” (i.e. the relativized verb) is marked as

"2336.3.1. Negation in verbal predicates6.3.1.1. Negating the verbAs already mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, to negate verbal predicates, the
Negation particle tak follows the verb, or the verb plus other elements, such as
auxiliaries. Negative clauses can present different word orders, depending on whether the
clause is a simple statement or an answer to a question. When it is the second case (i.e.
answer), the clause has a nominal-predicate configuration (cf. chapter 5, section 5.2.3 on
this issue). For instance:A

"The nouns that are losing initial /h/ in general refer to animals and material
objects (hujat ‘sea.gull’ ; huruts‘jaboti (kind of turtle)’ ; hura? 1 ‘bird’ ; hopep ‘arrow forJavari, a kind of ceremony’ ; hid ‘ordinary.arrow’), but there are nouns that do not fit
these two semantic groups (e.g. hulat ‘sand/beach’ ; hamu ‘noise’; Hiru ‘proper name’).
When we look at the nouns that are preserving /h/ in initial position, it seems that we
have a more semantically coherent subclass of nouns: several of them refer to body parts
or elements associated with them (hon ‘eye’ ; huksi ‘eyelash’ ; hud ‘thigh’ ; hokda
‘forehead’; homamak ‘ring’). However, there are also elements that do not belong to this
subclass (e.g. hotet ‘corn’; humau ‘person.in.reclusion’), which results in the fact that the
class of nouns preserving initial /h/ is not totally semantically homogeneous. Therefore,14the process of loss of /h/ at the beginning of words still needs to be better understood. For
the moment, we can say that the groups of words that preserve /h/ (verbs and some terms
for body parts) seems to be more homogeneous than the groups of words that exhibit its
loss.eAdults still retain the glottal fricative in initial position of words, in careful speech.
However, in fast speech, /h/ is prone to disappear, especially if the word occurs in the
middle of a clause, and this fact is observed both in the speech of young and adult
people. The words that often lose /h/ in fast speech are the adverb hen ‘then’, and
again, Ist and 2nd person pronouns. Examples:(8)nifits de
ha

then
‘Then, eat (it)!slow speech:[ma'nuk'hen]fast speech: /nuk hen/ > [nuken][manu'ken]* Finally, a speculation with regard to /h/: as mentioned before, /h/ is never attested wordfinally. Could this absence be due to the complete loss of the phoneme in this position?
That is, perhaps the loss of /h/ word-initially that is currently taking place is a7 In this example, not only /h/ is lost, but also the vowel of the adverb de ‘already’, probably in order to
avoid VV sequence after the loss of /h/ (i.e. dea > da).","[39, 40]"

the word order (plus the use of the morpheme yi). Here, we can see that the control of tsiis made by the NP that is more topical, not by the S or A argument of the clause.
In the next examples, we can see that the antecedent of tsi-/t- is the participant that
is the most logical possessor in the context of the development of the event.",[106]
"6.2.2. Information QuestionsThis kind of question involves the use of one of the interrogative words
(cf. chapter 2, section 2.2.3): te ‘who’; hele ‘how’; hamuna ‘where’, etc. The NP with the
interrogative word comes in first position, receiving the necessary case marking, and
usually is followed by the morpheme in, a mark of focus (cf. chapter 5, section 5.1.1).

will be presented briefly, as they were already described in previous chapters. As we will
see, in Trumai there are two main negators, the Negation particles tak and anuk. in
addition, there are other words which can also be used to express the idea of negation.
These words are the postposition nik ‘without’, the word t(a)ke ‘Privative’, and themorpheme n(i)kik.
We also have in this section a discussion with regard to scope, based on the ideas
of Givon (1984). As he explains, sometimes the scope of negation can be narrowed down,
with only one constituent being negated (the verb, a NP, etc.). By narrowing the scope, a
speaker can make the grounds of denial more precise. When scope is not narrowed, we
have a neutral negation, that is, the event as a whole is denied. According to Givon,
different strategies can be used for the negation of a single constituent. Some languages
front the constituent to be negated; other languages move the constituent to the clause
final position. Trumai has both strategies, but fronting is more common.","[259, 260]"
"3.1. The structure of a Verb Phrase
In the next three sections, we will see how a Trumai verb phrase is organizedinternally, which elements occur inside of it and in which order.",[112]
"10.3.2. Purpose subordinate clausesA Purpose subordinate clause refers to an event which is the target of the main
event. This kind of clause is like simple independent clauses with regard to argument
structure, possibility of occurrence of auxiliaries after the verb, and the occurrence of the3Abs enclitic -n/-e; in other words, this kind of clause is finite. What makes the Purpose
clause different from independent clauses is the presence of extra morphology, the
subordinating morpheme (a)hak, which establishes the connection between the Purpose401clause and the main clause. Purpose clauses come always at the end of the sentence,
following the main clause.
The subordinating morpheme (a)hak comes after the VP (101-105). When the
word order is not typical, (a)hak comes at the end of the Purpose clause (106). The
allomorph hak occurs when the preceding word ends in a vowel, and ahak when it ends in
a consonant (although there are exceptions, such as examples (105-106)). Examples:
(101)(102)hai-ts chi(_in)wawa-ktsi[ [hi otle]hak].","[428, 429]"
"As we can see, the facts observed in the Trumai data exactly181match the scenario described by Heine and Reh. For this reason, from now on we will
make distinction between contrastive focus - observed in examples (46-49) - and
completive focus, observed in examples (50-55) above. Although similar, these two
kinds of clauses are not the same, because their function is different (completive focusfills a gap in the knowledge of the addressee; contrastive focus does not fill a gap, it just
makes the knowledge of the addressee more accurate by correcting wrong information).
With regard to examples (53-55), they are also different from the clefts presented
above, because in these examples what separates S/O from the verb is an adverb, not the
Focus/Tense particles. Therefore, they do represent a different kind of environment forthe occurrence of ke.
A question is then raised: is the ke observed in clauses where the Absolutive NP is
far from the verb the same ke as found in nominalizations? Is it the same ke as found in
cleft clauses? We would like to say yes to this question, in order to have a unified account
for all these three cases, since in all of them the form in question is the same, ke.
However, a unified account is not possible, given the differences among the cases: the ke
nominalizer is phonologically different from the others, because it is bound: -ke. The
difference is more transparent when -ke modifies a root ending in vowel, because in this
case the allomorph used (-k) shows that the nominalizer is bound. The other two kemorphemes are insensitive to the last sound of the word they modify, as pointed outbefore.’ Also, ke relativizer shows some flexibilities that would not be expected with a7 Actually, the case of nominalizations involving verbal roots ending in consonant is a little more
complicated, because the allomorph used is ke, which then generates ambiguity between the nominalizer
and the relativizer. That’s why sometimes it is hard to say if what we have is one ke or the other. In order to
distinguish them, we take in account the context of occurrences (root + ke inside an NP or verb in a clause).","[206, 207]"
"4.1. Definition of the notion “Auxiliary” and the linguistic literatureAs Heine (1993:4-5) points out, the term ‘auxiliary’ is not very well defined in the
linguistic literature: “in many languages, experts will disagree with one another in
defining the term auxiliary, or in determining the range of entities that should be
subsumed under this label, or in deciding whether there is a need for such a label in thefirst place”. The relationship between auxiliaries and verbs is also a subject of intense
discussion: some authors treat them as different categories; others refer to auxiliaries as
subsets of verbs; there are authors that mention that some auxiliaries can have “main verb
uses” too. Heine also observes that auxiliaries have an “amphibian nature”, being neither
clearly lexical nor clearly grammatical entities.",[154]
"3.1.1. Nominal arguments inside the VPThe purpose of the section is to argue that the verb phrase in Trumai contains the
argument S or O of a clause, but excludes A, DAT, and NPs modified by postpositons.
The inclusion of S in the verb phrase and the exclusion of DAT are surprising, but there is
evidence for both. The evidence comes from the interaction of word order and
morphology, in which:87(i) a pronominal clitic (the 3rd Abs enclitic -n/-e) is in complementary distribution withthe absolutive head noun;
(ii) a special morpheme, ke, occurs whenever the absolutive NP is not immediately
preverbal;(iii) the two second position Focus/Tense particles, ka in and chi in, give special status to
the combinations [SV] and [OV];(iv) it is not possible to insert adverbs between S and V, or O and V, without triggering
extra morphology.
As illustration of how the third person enclitic -n/-e occurs in complementary
distribution with the head noun of S or O, consider (cf. also section 3.1.3):
(1)a. pitikora.monkey cry/scream
‘The monkey is screaming.’
b. ora-n.
cry/scream-3Abs
‘It is sreaming.’
(2)a. hai-ts ha atlepadi huk’an.","[112, 113]"
"86CHAPTER 3
Verbs and Verb PhraseIn this chapter, we describe the structure of the verb phrase in Trumai and the
word classes that occur in it: verbs, auxiliaries, particles, and adverbs. In section 3.3, we
describe the intensity, causation, negation, and imperative particles. There is a special
section on adverbs, given that they can occur not only inside the VP, but also outside,
modifying the whole clause. The final section of this chapter is dedicated to the Copuia,
which does not occur in a VP (the Copula occurs in non-verbal predicates), but which istreated in this chapter in order to be contrasted with verbs.","[111, 112]"
