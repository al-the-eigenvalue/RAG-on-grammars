"Griffiths 1973 describes demonstratives and numerals. Griffithsshows that the Kadiwéu demonstrative system is quite complex, encoding gender (m/f), number (sg/pl). and

constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO, while the constituent order of
subordinate clauses is always VSO. My data shows that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses is much
freer than Griffiths reports. Possible orders are OVS, VOS, SOV. OSV, VSO, and SVO. The high frequency of
SVO order in Griffiths’ publications seems to be biased by elicitation technique: I have found that Kadiwéu
speakers tend to translate Portuguese sentences with SVO order. The problem is that, although one can translate
Portuguese sentences word-by-wordinto Kadiwéu,proportion of the constituent order of Kadiwéu,the resulting set of Kadiwéuwhich has muchsentencesreflects a smallfreer order. Griffiths never mentions that(semantic) case is morphologically marked in Kadiwéu, and free constituent order is not unusual among languages

"Bresnan & Mchombo (1987) discuss the fact that Chichewa has an optional object marker on the verb. and
when the object marker occurs, word order is free, while word order is rigid when the object marker is absent. On
the basis of these facts, they claim that the object marker and nominal phrases share argument properties. Thus.
when the object markers appears, the overt nominal associated with it is not in argument position and hence is not
subject to ordering conditions. In contrast, when the object marker is not present. the nominal phrase is anargument and therefore follows a rigid order. Their analysis cannot be extended to Kadiwéu, however. becauseReproduced

"Many languages that have a free constituent order also havemorphologically marked case. In such languages case markers are like English prepositions in that they assignsemantic roles. Thus. several authors prefer to label these elements as semantic role markers or semantic case
markers (e.g. Simpson 1983).",[88]
"A morpheme such as -d: can occur with a subject pronoun(nominative) in unaccusative clauses (310) or object pronoun (accusative) in transitive clauses (311). Allsubjects (i.e. subjects of transitive clauses (which only appear if the object is third-person). unergative
subjects, unaccusative subjects. and subjects of passives and reflexives) are in the nominative case in
Kadiwéu. Objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.",[130]
"Several aspects of the Kadiwés syntax, which bear on theoretical issues, are discussed. Kadiwéu has
the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted, nominal
phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb,
expressions
are allowed.",[6]
"Although transitive verbs normally contain object markers. a third-person object is usually not marked. because
this is the lowest in the hierarchy. Therefore. when a transitive verb has a subject marker rather than an object
marker, one understands that the object is a third-person.
Since second person is higher than first person. a transitive verb whose subject is second person and whose
object is Isg can also be marked by a subject prefix rather than an object prefix. In this case, the subject marker
must be followed by the semantic case marker -d: 'theme’.",[61]
"(42)aObserve in 42 that the vowel is not merely lengthened: instead it is reduplicated into a new syllable. The
syllabic trochee languages which ban degenerate feet studied by Hayes allow no words consisting of a single light
syllable; however,they do allow monosyllabic words consisting of a heavy syllable. Hayes thus proposes thatsyllabic-trochee languages characteristically employ a minimal-word constraint which takes heavy syllables as
proper feet. Kadiwéu conterexemplifies Hayes’ generalization, since all stems containing an odd number of
syllables, even those which contain a long vowel, must be expanded in order to be well-formed. The wave forms inFigure 2 illustrates the analysis with the monosyllables ve: ‘he died' and ye 'my belly’. which show the same
reduplication pattern. Each peak in the wave represents one independent vowel. Long vowels appear as long peaks.",[42]
"According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and affixes are thearguments in nonconfigurational languages; nominal phrases are adjuncts, and therefore they can assume free
order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted. however. The existence of inflectional
morphemesfunctioningas argumentschallengestheidea of a fixed phraserelationships such as subject and object can be defined.structureAn altemative analysis wouldoverwhichsyntacticbe to say that themorphemes on the verb do not replace conventional argument phrases, but that nonconfigurational languages are
nothing more than cases of obligatory pro-drop languages. Baker 1984, for instance, argues that nominal phrases
are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that Mohawk pronominals are arguments. According to Baker. the verbal
arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting
Jelinek's hypothesis that inflectional morphemes can indeed be arguments in some languages. Arguments are
understood in this work as elements that (i) are in A-position (adjuncts are in A-bar position), (ii) are subject to the
Theta-criterion, and (iii) are subject to special kinds of syntactic operations (i.e. passivization, which affects
arguments but not adjuncts).
In 4.2.1 I show that pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements that assign semantic roles. The fact
that pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that
Kadiweu is a pronominal argument language of the Jelinek type rather than of the Baker type. In 4.2.2 a variety of
syntactic tests, for instance passivization — which affects pronominals but not nominal phrases — will be appliedReproduced

"Much of the work on SVCs is concerned with the fact that the constituent verbs of a SVC must share a
subject, but several authors have pointed out that the constituent verbs of a SVC must also share the theme
argument. As observed in Baker 1989. the theme argument of the first verb in a SVC is understood also as
the theme argument of the second verb. and when V2 take an object. this object must be marked as an
indirect object. This is the case with Kadiwéu SVCs. In 261 and 263 -ati and ka- normally take a direct
internal argument, but their object must be marked as an indirect object (i.e. an enclitic followed by a
semantic role marker) when they are part of a SVC. as in 262 and 264.7(261)Maria— yatilod:a:jo.",[111]
'SRecall that the subject of transitive clauses is marked when the object is third-person: when the objectis first- or second-person. the verb is marked by an object pronoun.,"[143, 144]"

""My way of loving’In order to license grammatical internal arguments (i.e. transitive. ditransitive. and unaccusative
clauses), we must add role suffixes. Example 308 and 309 show that a stem functions as a noun or a
transitive verb depending on whether the semantic role markers are present or not.","[128, 129]"
"The Kadiwéu verb is marked for its subject. direct object, and indirect object. Subjectand object markers are prefixes and indirect object markers are enclitics. I analyze indirect object markers as clitics
because clitics, as opposed to suffixes, trigger the deletion of sonorant consonants. Although Kadiwéu has both
subject and object prefixes. they never co-occur. Griffiths & Griffiths (1976) provide a list of transitive verbs in
which some verbs are marked by subject agreement and others are marked by object agreement. but they provide no
systematic account for this fact. Braggio (1981) tries to account for the complementary distribution of subject and
object prefixes in Kadiwéu via phonological rules; unfortunately, though, there is no phonological basis for the
complementary distribution of subject and object prefixes. Intransitive verbs are marked by subject prefixes and
transitive verbs are marked by object prefixes (except for the third-person direct object: when the object is thirdperson, the verb is marked by a subject prefix). The Kadiwéu pronominal affixes and enclitics are shown in Table

chapter 3 I present a detailed description of the verb and noun morphology. Chapter 4 is divided into four sections
that cover aspects of Kadiwéu (morpho)syntax: constituent order and sentence types. pronominals, serial verbs. and
valency/transitivity.",[13]
"In addition to the basicdescriptive study, I have investigated selected topics that bear on theoretical issues. In particular, I provide
evidence that pronominal clitics and affixes are arguments in Kadiwéu and that nominal phrases are optionally
adjoined to the sentence. Here I will briefly explain the significance of my results.
Kadiweéu has the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted.
nominal phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb, and some discontinuous nominal
expressions are allowed. Jelinek 1984 explains the properties of nonconfigurational languages by proposing that
languages set the elements which can work as verbal arguments. According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and
affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages: nominal phrases are adjuncts. and therefore they can
assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted, however. For instance, Baker
(1994) argues that nominal phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that pronominals are arguments in this
language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb.
Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinck's hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some
languages. First, pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly like English prepositions
in that they assign semantic roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive'. -g ‘goal’. -lokom
‘adessive', and -k ‘allative'. Nounsnever co-occur with such semanticrole assigners. Thefact that boundpronominals, rather than nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal
argument language of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests. for
instance passivization --- which affects pronominals but not nominal phrases -~ support the hypothesis.
This work has implications for studies of language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994
prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals.
rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. Kadiwéu roots resemble nouns of betterknown languages in that they are not transitive; that is, they cannot assign theta-roles to complements. Thomason
at al. 1994 argue that transitivity and valency must be distinguished. The facts of Kadiwéu support this proposal.
Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no transitive roots. Transitivity is introduced via morphemes
function as light verbs (Grimshaw & Mester 1988).",[14]
"40
3. Verb and Noun MorphologyThe structure of the verb seems to be similar in all the Waikurdan languages.* The verb agrees with the subject
and object in person and number (sg/pl). Kadiwéu, Toba, and Mocovi mark subject person with prefixes. but
number (pl) is marked with a suffix immediately following the root, althoughin Kadiwéu the pluralizingmorpheme for the third-person subject of transitive and unaccusative verbs is a prefix. All Waikurian languages
have a directional prefix n- ‘hither’ which is added to a verb stem. They also have a set of enclitics which mark
direction and motion. Aspect and mood, but not tense, are marked on the verb in Waikurian languages. Kadiwéu
has seven aspect markers -- completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive. and intensive — and two
mood markers. conditional and desiderative. There are also three negation markers.","[49, 50]"

of elements able to assign theta-roles.
Additional evidence that semantic role morphemes license grammatical arguments comes from
nominalization. Verbs can be nominalized by attaching the classifier n- ‘alienable'. Nominalization via the
attachment of n- does not affect the valency of the stem, and so eventive nouns are derived. The verb i:Gacin ‘teach’ includes the features cause and became, that is, it takes two arguments. The attachment

"Prosodic features have frequently been seen to be especially stable, but when languages remain in contact for
several centuries and a shift process toward the dominant language is slow, the opposite pattern has been attestedY It took us incredible work to understand our female interpreter, whowas alittle less barbarian than manyof the otherinfidels. One of the major difficulties was to convince the interpreter to say the words spoken by the men, which are different
from the ones spoken by the women. Since our interpreter was a woman, she gave us the words proper to her gender. Later we
used those words to talk to the men and they ironically asked us whether we were women: and then they corrected the voice
and told us the words proper to their gender.",[24]

"Kadiwéu long and short consonants are phonemically distinct. Braggio observes that subject and object prefixes do
not co-occur, and she tries to account for this complementary distribution of subject and object markers via
phonological rules. My data shows, however, that there is no plausible phonological basis for the complementarity
of subject and object prefixes in Kadiwéu. Moreover, Braggio complicates the Kadiwéu pronominal system by
postulating two sets of distinct subject prefixes. Kadiwéu has only one set of subject prefixes: these undergo regular
phonological alternations according to the semantic case suffix that follows them.","[15, 16]"
"'9Baker 1994 observes that the existence of anaphoric expressions in polysynthetic languages violatesboth Condition A and B of Binding Theory. Condition A is violated since the anaphoric expression is not
c-commanded by a nominal phrase in argument position. If Binding reconstruction applies. a pronominal
object would be coindexed with a pronominalsubject violating ConditionB. whichstates that apronominal cannot be bound by a c-commanding antecedent within the same clause. Thus. there is no way
to satisfy the properties of the pronominalarguments and of anaphoric expressionsin pronominalargument languages. Baker's argument can be probably extended to Kadiwéu; but since subject and object
pronominals do not overtly co-occur in Kadiwéu.specific syntactic tests are necessary to test whetherBinding reconstruction applies in this language and to embase the postulation of covert pronominalarguments.",[145]

"HigI assume that a lexical representation of a verb must encode a representation of the element of meaning
that sets the state or event expressed by that verb (represented here simply as STATE and LOCATION)
and a set of primitives predicates that represent syntactic generalizations of the meaning of a verb (I will
use the predicates cause and becometo represent these primitive predicates). A LCS encodes alsoinformation about the semantic participants of an event which can be filled or satisfied in syntax: external
argument, represented as the subject of cause (x); internal direct argument. represented as the subject of
become (y): and indirect external argument. represented as z.
I make a distinction between semantic participants and grammatical arguments. Semantic participants
are the arguments present in a LCS. Grammatical arguments are those which actually appear in syntax.
This allows for an lexical entry to have semantic arguments appearing in their LCS which are not mapped
in syntax. Thus. for instance, the verb eat is bivalent; that is, it requires two semantic arguments —- the
one who causes the action of eating (x) and the one which becomes eaten (v). In syntax, however. eat
sometimes have only one grammatical argument (e.g. John ate). Although semantically eat has two
arguments (we understand that John (x) ate something (y)). syntactically eat may have only one argument
(x). The distinction between semantic participants and grammatical argumentsis fundamentalfor alanguage as Kadiwéu because in Kadiwéu there is a frequent mismatch between semantic participants and
grammatical arguments. as will be seen in 4.4.2.
In Kadiwéu any root can appear in a predicate. But certain roots must be modified by the suffixes
glossed in Table 14 as [+cause] and as [+become] in order to appear in a predicate. Compare examples
278 and 279, the root in 279 must be followed the suffix -ti. [ assume that cause and become are a
fundamental part of the meaning of a verb and [ propose that the suffixes in Table 14 operate on the LCS
of an lexical entry, adding or deleting cause and become. On this hypothesis, the root in 278 is a verb
and the root in 279 is a noun. The addition of -ti introduces cause and an external argument licensing a
noun to occur as the head of a predicate.","[119, 120]"

"Eventivenominals in English have an a-structure as well, but they cannot assign theta-role. Therefore. in order to
have grammatical arguments, eventive nouns need a theta-assigner. Thus, eventive nouns appear with a
preposition in English (e.g. donation of money to hospitals) and with a light verb in some constructions of
Japanese. My proposal is that Kadiwéu does not have any lexical category that is able to theta-assign. The
elements that [ classify as verbs in Kadiwéuare similar to eventive nominals of of better knownlanguages: they are valent (i.e. have an argument structure in Grimshaw's terminology) but they are notReproduced
