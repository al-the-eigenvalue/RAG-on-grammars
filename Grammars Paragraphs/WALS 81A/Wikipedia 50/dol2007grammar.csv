"Introduction5Bird’s Head. The language described in the present study is a family-level isolate within
the West Papuan Phylum (WPP).8 This phylum also includes some North Halmahera
languages (Voorhoeve 1987a:717).9
Some characteristics shared by all the WPP10 languages of the Bird’s Head are their
SVO word order, as opposed to the SOV order of those of the TNGP languages. All WPP
languages have prefixes that are coreferent with the subject (for verbs), or with the
possessor (of inalienably possessed nouns). In most languages there is a gender distinction,
and an opposition between inclusive and exclusive forms in the first person plural (Reesink
1996:2–3).11 There seem to be some similarities in the pronominal prefix systems across
WPP languages, suggesting a genetic relation (Cowan 1953:24–26; Reesink 1996:4). All
known languages display sequences of verbs under one clausal intonation contour (Reesink
1996:6), and the word order in NPs is generally: Noun-Adjective-(Classifier)-NumeralDeterminer (Reesink 1996:8). Nominal compounds generally have the order ‘N1+ N2’,
where the whole noun is ‘a kind of N2’ (Reesink 1996:13).
Recent research,12 however, has indicated that viewing the WPP as a group of
genetically related languages is difficult to maintain: in a comparative study Reesink has
hypothesised no less than seven unrelated language groups (Reesink 1996:18). A striking
feature of these languages is the low number of shared lexical items found between the
groups, contrasting with typological similarities. This has led to the hypothesis that
thousands of years ago, possibly even before the arrival of the Austronesians on the
peninsula,13 a number of unrelated languages were spoken in the Bird’s Head peninsula.
Through trade a kind of ‘Sprachbund’ emerged, in which morphosyntactic features were
shared, but vocabularies were not (Reesink 1996:x). So, instead of finding new evidence
for the interrelatedness of the languages of the WPP, recent research has only created an
even more confusing linguistic map of the Bird’s Head area.
1.5 Previous research in Maybrat
Before 1993, some research had been done in the Maybrat area. The first linguistic
notes were made by J.-E. Elmberg, who worked in the Ayamaru area between 1953 and
1957. The Popot feast cycle (1966) includes sixteen pages of transcriptions of texts in the
dialect of Ayamaru (below referred to as Maymaru). These transcriptions give an idea of
the language, but the English translations are free, that is there are no interlinear glosses,
and there is no morphological breakdown. No orthographic conventions are given, so only
very superficial phonetic information can be gathered from these texts. The work also

McElhanon 1975:152).

Foley (1986) does not discuss the WPP at all, as hardly any information on this Phylum was available.
10
However, most WPP languages on Halmahera do have SOV word order (Voorhoeve 1988:192–193; van
Staden pers. comm.).
11
Both the SVO word order and the inclusive/exclusive distinction are typically Austronesian
characteristics. With respect to the opposition between inclusive and exclusive which is not grammatically
expressed, Maybrat is an exception in the Bird’s Head. The absence of this opposition was also pointed
out by Cowan (1953:21). For more information on first person plural forms in Maybrat (see §4.1.1).
12
Within ISIR, work has been done on the languages Moi (Menick 1995, 1996); Hatam (Reesink 1999);
Inanwatan (de Vries 1996); Mpùr (Odé 1995:1996).

According to radiocarbon dating of archaeological remains, the Austronesian population started to
disperse into Western Oceania around 3300 BP (Bellwood et al. 1998:233).","[22, 23]"
"5Noun phrasesIn this chapter I will discuss noun phrases (NP), that is structures that are headed by a
noun (or a pronoun) and that may have one or more dependents (Matthews 1981:161–162).
NPs typically function as arguments in a clause.
The basic structure of possible NPs in Maybrat is given in example (1). The portions
between braces can be subsumed under the heading ‘modifier’. The order of constituents in
the NP is rigid.
(1)Types of noun phrase:
a. ‘Regular’ noun phrase (NP):
N + (Verbal Modifier + [(Classifier) + Numeral]/[Quantifying verb]
+ Determiner)
b. Possessive NP:
N + (Ninalienable + [(Classifier) + Numeral] + Determiner) /
Nalienable + (ro + N + [(Classifier) + Numeral] + Determiner)
c. Relative clause (RC):
N + (ro + Clausal Modifier + Determiner)Thus, Maybrat is a ‘postmodifying’ language, since the modifiers follow the head noun.
This postnominal modifying order is in accordance with one of Greenberg’s universals,
namely that languages which have VO word order (Maybrat word order is SVO, see
Chapter 6) usually have noun-modifier order in NPs (Givón 1984:189, 199, 220, refers to
Greenberg 1966). The order of modifiers themselves in the NP conforms to another
universal, namely that if a language is post-modifying, the order of the modifiers is as
follows: descriptive adjective — numeral — demonstrative (Croft 1990:119, refers to
Greenberg 1966:87).
Below, §5.1 concentrates on the structure of the NP as given in example (1a). As was
pointed out in §4.3.1–§4.3.2, two types of possessive construction can be identified, given
in (1b). Possessive NPs are discussed in §5.2. In §5.3, I will describe the form and function
of relative clause constructions (RCs), where a head noun is modified by an RC. The basic
structure of RCs is given in (1c). As is apparent from (1b) and (1c) above, there are two
types of nominal construction which have the element ro in common (also pointed out in
§4.10.1). I will focus on the similarities between possessive constructions and RCs in §5.4.
127128Chapter 5In §5.5 I will illustrate how adverbials can modify a phrase. Finally, in §5.6, I will
discuss combinations of NPs.
5.1 The regular noun phrase
5.1.1 Head
The head in an NP is obligatory. It can be a noun, a pronoun, a quantifying verb (see
§5.1.5) or an attributive demonstrative (see §5.1.6). If the head is a pronoun, then there are
restrictions on the modifiers. Some examples of NPs headed by a noun are:
(2)ru m-api wo-n-o
bird 3U-big location.GEN-far-U
‘the big bird approximately there’(3)tfo
m-kek m-aku
s-au
machete 3U-red 3U-small one-3U
‘one small red machete’(4)ora
ø-pria t-o
garden ø-all
near-U
‘the entire garden’In examples (5)–(6) the head of the NP is semantically a proper noun. NPs which are
headed by a proper noun followed by an adjectival verb are typically nicknames.
(5)Simon y-apuf
re-t-ait
Simon 3M-short location.SPEC-near-3M
‘that Short Simon’(6)Maria m-anes re-au
Maria 3U-old location.SPEC-DIST.U
‘that Old Maria’
Examples of NPs headed by a free pronoun appear below:(7)ait y-api re-t-ait
3M 3M-big location.SPEC-near-3M
‘that big one (man)’(8)ana eok ro-n-o
3P two location.SPEC-far-U
‘the two of them there’ (lit. ‘they two there’)(9)ana ø-prut
3P ø-all
‘all of them’5.1.2 Verbal modifiers
In §4.2.2.2 a class of adjectival verbs was presented including some illustrative
examples of NPs where they function attributively. I stipulated that in an NP, adjectivalNoun phrases129verbs take a person prefix which is coreferent with the head of the NP. Some more
examples follow:
(10)rae
y-anes re-t-ait
person 3M-old location.SPEC-near-M
‘this old man’(11)fnia
m-anes re-t-o
woman 3U-old location.SPEC-near-U
‘this old woman’Noun phrases rarely occur with more than one verbal modifier. In examples (12) and
(13) there are two modifiers. The maximum number of verbal modifiers attested in the data
is two. In (13) the head noun is a compound noun. If more verbal modifiers are desired in
an NP, RC constructions are used, as in (14) (see §5.3):
(12)ku
ø-kiniah m-of
t-o
child ø-small 3U-nice near-U
‘these nice small children’(13)ara aut
m-api ø-kapes s-au
{Albizzia sp.} 3U-big ø-huge one-3U
‘one very big “Albizzia sp. tree”’1(14)ku
ø-kiniah m-of
ro ø-hifuoh
child ø-small 3U-good REL ø-diligent
‘the good small children that are diligent’If there are two modifiers, there is a preferred order: the information that is more
prominent or that expresses a more inherent property of the noun is found closer to the
noun (see Givón 1990:470). Thus, in example (15) (both of which are elicited utterances),
the implication in (15a) is that the tree is yellow of itself (that is ‘yellow’ pertains to a
salient characteristic of tree) and that an added property of the tree is that it is big. This is
precisely the other way around for (15b), where ‘big’ refers to an intrinsic property of the
tree, and an additional feature is that the tree is yellow.2
(15) a.ara ø-fiyaf
m-api t-o
tree ø-yellow 3U-big near-U
‘the big yellow tree’b.ara m-api ø-fiyaf
t-o
tree 3U-big ø-yellow near-U
‘the yellow big tree’5.1.3 Classifier
Classifiers may precede a numeral in an NP. Classifiers are used to emphasise the
number of items expressed by the noun head of the NP. Both forms below are acceptable,
and I have not been able to establish a semantic difference between the two:
1
2The grated bark of ara aut is heated in fire, and applied to boils to improve healing (Avé 1998:2).
Ara fiyaf can syntactically also be a compound noun (see §4.3.5). Ara fiyaf is claoxyloa sp. or Melicope
xanthoxyloides (Avé 1998:B8).","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"6The clauseA clause is a unit consisting minimally of a predicate and its arguments. Its function is
to introduce new propositions in the discourse (Givón:1984:85). The description of the
clause in Maybrat must be centred around two criteria, namely syntactic and intonational:
syntactically, the simplest type of clause consists of a verb and its arguments and,
optionally, its (adverbial) modifiers. Given that the person prefix on a verb expresses its
subject when the verb functions as a clause, it can be assumed that a person prefix
functions as a subject argument in a clause. With the exception of the obligatory person
prefix, the arguments of a verb need not be expressed as NPs, leaving a clause which
formally consists of a single verb. This type of clause has a unique intonation pattern. This
intonation pattern is needed to distinguish between the two forms below: formally both
constitute a sequence of verbs, and could theoretically constitute a sequence of clauses.
However, they are intonationally different, which indicates that example (1a) syntactically
consists of two clauses, while (1b) consists of one clause, in which t-aut ara functions as
an object complement:
(1) a.b.t-sam
/ t-aut
ara
1s-scared
1s-climb tree
‘I’m scared, and I climb into the tree.’
t-sam
t-aut
ara
1s-scared 1s-climb tree
‘I’m scared to climb into the tree.’Examples of this type are discussed in the chapter on sequences of verbs.
In this chapter I will restrict myself to a description of ‘simple’ clauses, that is those
consisting of a single verb as predicate. The description of sequences of clauses is deferred
until Chapter 8. The present chapter is set up as follows: in §6.1, I will give the basic
syntactic structure of the clause, and its intonational characteristics. Section 6.2 discusses
the head of the clause, §6.3 the subject and §6.4 the object. Subsequently, in §6.5, nominal
clauses are presented. Topicalisation is described in §6.6. In §6.7, I will discuss
relativisation, that is the extraction of subject and object arguments from single-verb
clauses. In §6.8, the various types of adverbials that add extra information to a clause are
treated. These adverbials are collectively referred to as the ‘periphery’ of the clause. The
different types of periphery that can be distinguished are the time periphery; the manner
periphery; the aspect periphery; and the focus periphery. In §6.8.5 I will show that these
142The clause143peripheries can be combined. In the following section the location periphery is treated. In
§6.9 negation, formed with the adverb fe, is discussed. In §6.10, the clausal determiner is
described. In §6.11, I will give some examples of anaphoric reference, although this is,
strictly speaking, a discourse phenomenon, and not a clausal phenomenon.
6.1 Basic structure of the clause
The basic structure of the clause in Maybrat is given in example (2). The order of
constituents, SVO, is rigid.
(2){Time} + (Subject) s-V (+Object) + {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}A clause always consists of a head, the verb (V) taking an overt or covert person prefix.
Subjects and objects may be expressed as full NPs, but may also be omitted if they have
been mentioned earlier in the discourse. The omission of a subject or object does not
violate the acceptability of a clause. An object normally follows the verb, but it may also
be ‘topicalised’, that is fronted, to attract the attention of the listener. Temporal adverbials
precede the verb, and may precede the subject NP, in a clause, while location/manner/
aspect adverbials normally follow the verb and, if present, the object.
A salient characteristic of clauses is their intonation pattern: on the last word of the
clause the pitch rises slightly, followed by a sharp drop. Following this sharp drop, there is
a pause.1
(3)ait y-amo Kumurkek òh
/ men
y-e
ù
/
3M 3M-go Kumurkek already tomorrow 3M-return again
‘He’s already gone to Kumurkek, tomorrow he will return again.’If another sentence follows, there may also be a rise in pitch, as illustrated below. The
same example illustrates that a fall in pitch at the end of a clause is not obligatory:
(4)y-pat
Tenau Kosetiáh / y-ama
y-hu / Tenau Kohmaró
3M-from Tenau Kosetiah
3M-come 3M-stay Tenau Kohmaro
‘He was from Tenau Kosetiah, he came to live at Tenau Kohmaro ...’/Intonation may be indicative of a differing constituent structure, as indicated in example
(5). Example (5a) contains two clauses, because there is a fall in pitch on the last syllable
of m-anes, followed by a pause. In this example, ku m-anes functions as a clause.
Conversely, (5b) contains just one clause: the only intonation break and sharp drop in pitch
are found utterance- (=clause) finally. Here, ku m-anes functions as a subject.
(5) a.b.","[159, 160, 161]"

‘She immediately lifts up the white pig and (takes) it with her, she lifts her

In this chapter, relativisation was used as a test for constituency. A number of forms,
notably objects of prepositional verbs, were difficult or impossible to relativise. These facts
about relativisation in Maybrat correspond to the generalisation introduced by Keenan and
Comrie (1977:66), stated in the Accessibility Hierarchy, given below:
Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Object of Preposition > Possessor
(from Keenan (1985:147))
One of the generalisations that applies to this hierarchy is that if a language can
relativise a position which is low on the hierarchy, then all the positions higher on this
hierarchy can also be relativised (Keenan & Comrie 1977:68). Thus, if a language can
relativise direct objects, then it can also relativise subjects. A language may have a strategy
to make relativisation possible, such as lexical reorganisation, in order to attain this goal
(Keenan & Comrie 1977:71).
To begin on the left-hand side of the Accessibility Hierarchy, in single verb clauses in
Maybrat, relativisation of subjects and objects is always possible, as illustrated in §6.7. The
objects of prepositional notions expressed with verbs -pat ‘from’ and -kit ‘towards’, that is
the prepositional verbs that morphologically behave most like verbs, can be relativised on,
as long as the prepositional verb is preceded by another verb, as in (119). In other words,
these objects behave like ‘normal’ objects.

y-ama
m-hu e
forest
REL 3M-from 3M-come 3U-stay far
‘The forest from where he comes is far (away).’The object of the prepositional ‘verb’ m-kah can be relativised on, but the order of the
verbs has to be reversed in the RC. In other words, Maybrat has a strategy to make
relativisation on the object of this verb possible.

ro m-kah t-kom
am
ø-kiyam m-ase
child REL 3U-to 1S-write letter ø-ill
3U-very
‘The child for whom I write a letter is very ill.’Objects of the ‘defective paradigm’ prepositional verb -ae ‘at’ cannot be relativised,
as in (121). In terms of the hierarchy, Maybrat treats the objects of these verbs as
prepositional objects.","[229, 230]"
"146Chapter 6(19) a.rere
tuo t-amo amah
shortly 1S 1S-go house
‘Shortly I will go home.’b.tuo rere
t-amo amah
1S shortly 1S-go house
‘Shortly I will go home.’The ‘risk’ in omitting subject NPs is that the clause becomes unintelligible because the
referent of the subject is unknown. This is especially the case for clauses including a verb
with a covert person prefix.
6.4 The object
Like subject NPs, object NPs can also be omitted without violating the grammaticality
of an utterance. This is illustrated in the pairs in (20)–(22) below, where in the a-varieties
the clause has a nominal object, and in the b-varieties this object is absent.
(20) a.b.(21) a.b.(22) a.b.m-kai ru

3U-carry.on.back
‘She carries (something) on her back.’
t-e
am
3U-give letter
‘I give a letter.’
t-e
1S-give
‘I give.’Like the omission of subject NPs, the motivation for omitting objects from clauses
which contain a transitive verb is pragmatic: if the object is referred to earlier in the
discourse, and is hence known to the listener, then it can be omitted. In example (23), the
object of m-tah ‘They eat small meat’ is ru r-ana ‘their bird’. ‘Ø’ refers to an omitted
object.

‘They returned again and then they roasted their bird and after that they ate (it).’
Another example is given in the passage in (24)–(26). In (25) the implied object of
m-aut ‘They climb’ is ara wisam ‘“wisam” tree’, given in (24). In (26) the implied object
of m-ehoh is apan, occurring earlier in the same sentence.
(24)ku

apan m-arak
ana eok m-ehoh Ø
3U-meet snake 3U-empty 3U two 3U-stab
‘After they found the snake the two stabbed (=killed) (it).’Omission of nominal arguments is also attested in other Papuan languages and,
according to Foley, characteristic of the fact that in Papuan languages morphology is more
important in the organisation of the grammar than syntax (Foley 1986:168–171). Although
Maybrat has little morphology, and word order is relevant in the organisation of the
grammar, the ‘dropping’ of nominal objects is allowed. As far as I know, any ‘transitive’
verb can also occur without its object, and still be acceptable.
6.5 Nominal clauses
Nominal clauses are clauses with a nominal head. In nominal clauses, the ‘subject’
usually refers to a known entity, while the nominal predicate gives additional information
about that entity. Semantically, nominal clauses can often be adequately translated as
equative clauses, that is clauses of the form ‘x is y’. Nominal clauses can be modified by
adverbials in the same way as verbal clauses. The structure of a verbless clause is:
(27){Time} Subj [NP] {Location/Manner/Aspect + Det}Some examples of nominal clauses appear below. In example (29) the subject contains
an RC, and in (30) the head of the clause is a possessive form.
(28)ait guru
3M teacher
‘He is a teacher.’(29)iso ro rae
kertia tiaran raya4
road REL person work road main
‘The road that people are working on is the main road.’3
4The species referred to by ara wisam was not found by the botanists in Ayawasi (see Avé 1998).
Kertia and tiaran were pronounced by an elderly man who has not received an education in Indonesian.
The pronunciation of these words is adapted (see §2.8).","[163, 164, 165]"

s-au
arin

moment one-3u situation evening already
‘Once upon a time, it was already dark.’Nominal clauses have the same intonational structure as verbal clauses, that is there is a
rise in pitch on the last word of the clause followed by a sharp drop in pitch on the last
syllable of that word, followed by a pause. This is illustrated in example (33). In (33) po
s-au fo constitutes a nominal clause, while y-awe n-ama ø-srot constitutes a verbal clause.
Both clauses are followed by a pause, and the pitch drops on the final syllable of the
utterance:
(33)y-awe n-ama ø-sròt / po
s-au
f-ò

3M-say 2-come ø-fast
thing one-3U very.near-U
‘He says: “Come quickly. Something is the matter.”’6.6 Topicalisation
Although the SVO word order in Maybrat is very rigid, there is a notable variation
whereby the object is placed in clause-initial position. The function of this movement of
object is to switch the attention of the listener away from one ‘topic’, usually the subject of
the discourse, to another ‘topic’. Following Keenan (1985:243), I will refer to the fronting
of objects as ‘topicalisation’.6 The example below gives a contrast between a form where
the object follows the verb (34a) and one where it is fronted (34b). In (34b) the object am
re-f-o ‘this book’ is conceptually more prominent than am re-f-o in (34a). Example (34b) is
more marked than (34a), where the word order is regular.

3M-with 1S-mother
‘This book, I wrote it for my father and mother.’
Topicalised objects are separated from the rest of the clause by a pause, and they are
dominated by their own intonation contour. These intonational characteristics are typical of
what Givón refers to as ‘left-dislocation’, a device used to switch the attention of the reader
back to topics that were introduced earlier in the conversation (Givón 1990:757, 759).7 An
example follows:

illustrate the pragmatic motivations to topicalise the object. In examples (37)–(38),
topicalised objects are underlined:

‘She ordered, his mother, she ordered saying: “you go and cut treebark
and other things. Then come back, so that the sago thing, we place it so
that we can stir it.”’878Givón makes a distinction between left-dislocation, whereby topics ‘that have been out of the focus of
attention for a while ... are being brought back’ (Givón 1990:757), and Y-movement or contrastive
topicalisation. Y-movement is used to contrast a referent with another referent of approximately the same
semantic class (Givón 1990:754). An example of left-dislocation is ‘John, I never saw him there’; an
example of Y-movement is ‘I saw John there. Mary I never saw.’ (the moved constituents are underlined).
What I describe as ‘topicalisation’, in Maybrat corresponds pragmatically and syntactically to Givón’s
left-dislocation.

then stirring until the porridge ‘sets’, i.e. becomes a gluey substance.","[166, 167]"

"166Chapter 6However, the function of ora in each of the forms in (151) is different: in (151b) ora
functions as the nominal object of the verb. A property of this type of object, as was
illustrated in (147), is that it can be relativised. This does not apply to to ora in (151a), as
illustrated in the two forms in (152), which are unacceptable. In other words, to ora is not a
nominal constituent, but rather an adverbial constituent like kait ‘near’ in (148a) and u
‘above’ in (149).

in example (153). Other combinations of locative adverbials are unattested.

‘They go to the top of the hill.’Locative adverbials may be combined with manner, aspect or focus adverbials. As with
other combinations of adverbials, the scope of the clause-final adverbial is over the entire
clause, and the scope of the pre-final adverbial does not include the final adverbial. A
contrast is given in example (154): forms like (154b) do occur, but they are very marked.

There are two ways to express negation, namely with the clausal negator fe and with its
predicative counterpart m-fe. These negators are discussed in §6.9.1 and §6.9.2. In §6.9.3, I
will illustrate that it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between fe and m-fe.
Section 6.9.4 discusses negation of clauses involving adverbial modifiers. I will show how
the scope of the negator can be influenced by varying the order of the negator and the
adverbial in a clause. Some examples of frequently used combinations of negators and
adverbials, such as fe fares ‘not yet’ and m-fe fi-t-o ‘if this is not the case’ are also
discussed. Finally, in §6.9.5 I will present some other forms which semantically express
negation, namely kayie and peroh.
6.9.1 Clausal negator fe
The clausal negator fe occurs in clause-final position, but see (162). Some examples:
(157)om m-ais
fe
rain 3U-descend NEG
‘It is not raining.’(158)ana m-asah fe
3P 3U-laugh NEG
‘They do not laugh.’(159)ait y-amo Kumurkek fe
3M 3M-go Kumurkek NEG
1. ‘He does not go to Kumurkek.’
2. ‘He goes, but not to Kumurkek.’(160)ait y-e
pitis
fe
3M 3M-give money NEG
1. ‘He does not give money.’
2. ‘He gives something, but not money.’In these examples, the unmarked interpretation is where the verb is negated, that is
reading 1. This is in accordance with the typological pattern of SVO-languages, in which
the negative marker is usually a verbal operator rather than a sentential one (cf. Givón
1984:336). However, an interpretation in which only the object is negated (reading 2) is
also common. If a negated sentence allows more than one interpretation, there are two
ways to resolve this ambiguity: one is to use emphasis, as in example (161), and the other
is to add an extra clause which indicates which constituent is to be negated, as in (162):
(161)ait y-e
pítis
fe
3M 3M-give money NEG
‘He does not give money (but something else).’(162)ana m-e
fe23 ait. M-e
mtah r-ait,
Uris
3P 3U-give NEG 3M 3U-give dog
POSS-3M Uris
‘They do not give anything to him, they give it to his dog Uris.’23This is the only attested instance of a negator preceding an object in a clause.","[183, 184, 185]"
"Word classes75syntactic function of the quantifying verb is, since there are no conclusive intonational
cues.14 It is also unclear whether there is a significant semantic difference:

‘all the houses/every house’It seems that in (67) the quantifying verb ‘floats’ through the sentence. A property
associated with quantifiers is their ability to ‘float’ through a syntactic constituent rather
than occupy a fixed position (Crystal 1991:286), so the pair in (67), and the other examples
where the syntactic function of the quantifying verb seems elusive may be typical for this
particular word class.
4.2.3 Transitive verbs
Transitive verbs can take two arguments, namely a subject and an object. Maybrat does
not have verbs that can take more than two arguments. A distinction is made between
different classes of transitive verbs based on their behaviour in sequences of verbs. In this
section, I will define these classes. The syntactic motivations for assigning these verbs to
their respective subclasses are given in Chapter 8.
4.2.3.1 Regular transitive verbs
The object argument of a regular transitive verb must be a noun (68), a pronoun (69), a
demonstrative (70), or an NP (71):
(68)t-ehoh fane
1S-stab pig
‘I stab the pig.’(69)m-ape

‘She carries him on her back.’(70)n-kom re-t-o

‘You write this.’(71)y-nit
po-mna
ro m-of
3M-tell NOM-tell.tale REL 3U-good
‘He tells a tale which is nice.’The object argument of a regular transitive verb need not be expressed: if the object is
known from the preceding discourse, it can be omitted without rendering the utterance
ungrammatical, see (72). Constraints on the omission of objects are discussed in §6.4.","[92, 93]"

In §4.3.1 and §4.3.2, I introduced two types of possessive construction, and I used them
as a criterion to distinguish between alienably and inalienably possessed nouns: in
possessive constructions where the inalienably possessed noun expresses the possessed the
order of the nouns is ‘possessor-possessed’, while in constructions where the alienably
possessed noun expresses the possessed, the order is reversed, that is ‘possessedpossessor’. In the latter, the possessive marker ro precedes the possessor. Examples with
inalienably possessed nouns (50) and (51), and with alienably possessed nouns (52) and
(53) are summarised below:
(50)Yan y-atia
Yan 3M-father
‘Yan’s father’(51)aof m-ake
sago 3U-fruit
‘the fruit of the sago’(52)amah ro-Sely
house POSS-Sely
‘Sely’s house’(53)fane r-ait
pig POSS-3M
‘his pig’In an NP, a possessive construction can be modified by a number phrase, as illustrated
in examples (54)–(56):
(54)ru m-aim

‘two bird’s wings’(55)mikie9 r-ait

‘his one small knife’9Given the order of constituents in the possessive construction ø-mikie r-ait ‘his co-wives’, I assume that
this is an alienably possessed noun, although semantically it could well be a kinship term.",[153]
"263Appendix IIFnia m-kiar ‘Women who are decorated’
This interview was recorded in collaboration with Wanda Avé, ethnobotanist, in
Ayawasi in October 1995. The woman who was interviewed is Ais Mawe, approximately
45 years of age, who spoke very little Indonesian. The purpose of the interview was for
Avé to find out if there are any particular plants used by women, particularly during their
initiation. We asked Elisabeth Korain, 35 years old, and bilingual in Maybrat and
Indonesian, to attend the interview in order to translate and explain if necessary. While
Avé used the interview primarily for the botanical information that Ais Mawe gave, I used
the text as linguistic data. The botanical names of plants that are known are given in the
text. They are taken from the list compiled by Wanda Avé (1998), ‘Preliminary list of the
use of the plants of Ayawasi’.
The recording was made at a house in Ayawasi, using a walkman and a separate
microphone. The text was later transcribed from the recording with the help of Elisabeth
Korain and her husband, Petrus Turot.
Ais Mawe belongs to the lineage Turot, which originates from the area to the north of
Ayawasi. There are some instances in the following text which contain forms that are
unattested elsewhere. I have indicated these as possibly dialectal forms.
Below, I have indicated pauses (‘ / ’) to make the syntactic structure more transparent.

‘With the hammer they hit the kiyit.’12/Kiyit is possibly a dialectal variant of kiet, the bark of a plant of the Ficus family. The kiet bark is hit with
a hammer (a hpat, see next line), in order to make it softer so that they can use it as a garment. Kiyit also
refers generically to garments (see line 12).
The object hpat ‘hammer’ is topicalised (see §6.6). Other instances of topicalisation occur, for instance, in
line 4 (po-kiar ‘decoration’); 14 (prat m-api s-au ‘one big waistband’); 23 (am ‘mat’); 31 and 32 (aya
‘water’).","[281, 282]"

sentence occur commonly in Maybrat, as they do indeed in many Papuan languages (see,
for instance Foley 1986:175–176). Superficially many of these sequences look alike. For
instance, morphologically (1) and (2) look similar because each verb carries a person
prefix. However, they are quite different in constituency. Example (1) represents a
coordinating construction, in which each verb constitutes a separate clause. This is
indicated in the translation. In order to coordinate clauses, an overt coordinator, like
English ‘and’ is not needed in Maybrat. Example (1) is formally similar to (2), so there is
nothing that prevents us from interpreting (2) as ‘He speaks and he stabs a cuscus.’
However, syntactically these constructions are quite different: in (2), y-ame kak ‘he kills a
cuscus’ is an object complement of y-awe. Likewise, by analogy to (1), (3) could be
translated as ‘He goes and he towards the sago tree’ although this translation sounds odd.
In (3), y-kit aof functions as the locative object of the verb y-amo.
(1)y-apo y-ata
3M-eat 3M-drink
‘He eats and he drinks.’(2)y-awe y-ame kak
3M-say 3M-stab cuscus
‘He wants to stab a cuscus.’(3)rae
y-amo y-kit
aof
person 3M-go 3M-towards sago.tree
‘The man goes towards the sago tree.’The question, of course, is in what ways one type of verb sequence differs from another,
and what criteria can be used to describe these distinctions. In the present chapter I will
illustrate how with a number of different criteria the syntactic differences between the
sequences like those in examples (1)–(3) can be described. The different types of verb
sequences that can be identified in Maybrat are listed below (including the section where
they are discussed):186Sequences of verbs

comitatives
a problematic categoryThe chapter is set up as follows: In §8.1, I will present a discussion of coordinating
sequences of verbs. They are characterised according to three different types of criteria,
namely intonational (§8.1.1); morphological (§8.1.2); and syntactic (§8.1.3). In the section
on syntax, I will perform three tests that bring out the constituency of these coordinating
verb sequences: insertion of an overt coordinator; examination of the scope of the
interrogative marker a; and relativisation on the object of a clause. Having established the
properties of coordinating sequences of verbs, I will contrast other types of juxtaposed
verbal forms with these coordinating sequences. In §8.2, I discuss what will be referred to
as adverbial verbs, that is sequences that include a verb which functions as a modifier to a
main verb. Section 8.3 concentrates on sequences in which the second verb (and its
arguments or modifiers) functions as an object complement of the first verb. In these
sequences, the first verb may be a perception verb; a mental activity verb; the causative
verb -no ‘do’; or the verb -awe ‘say’. Section 8.4 discusses prepositional verbs. I will show
that some prepositional verbs have more ‘verbal’ properties than others. The latter behave
more like prepositions. In §8.5, I will describe some syntactic properties of comitative
constructions.
Having used relativisation as a syntactic test for the constituency of sequences of verbs
in this chapter, in §8.6 I will summarise some properties of the relativisability of arguments
in different syntactic types of constructions. I will relate these facts to Keenan and
Comrie’s ‘Accessibility Hierarchy’. Finally, in §8.7, I will present some types of verb
sequences that share properties with both the coordinating constructions discussed in §8.1,
and the constructions involving an object complement. These constructions resemble
constructions that are labelled ‘serial verb constructions’ (SVCs) in the literature.
In the remainder of this chapter, if I refer to ‘verb’, it is implied that this includes a
verbal form plus its arguments, unless otherwise stated. I realise that strictly speaking,
‘verb’ refers to a morphological entity, whereas in this section the functional
characteristics, or the constituency of the verbal forms, are discussed. However, using the
term ‘clause’ for these entities is misleading, since it will appear that some verbal forms
are not clausal. Therefore, ‘verb’ is chosen as a neutral umbrella term.
8.1 Coordination
A coordinating construction can be defined as a construction involving a sequence of
syntactic units, all of the same syntactic category and rank (Zwicky 1990:4). The elements
in these sequences can be either juxtaposed or overtly coordinated (Dik 1997:196). The
problem in Maybrat, as illustrated in examples (1)–(3), is the absence of overt coordinators
in sequences which formally (that is categorially) contain verbs, but functionally (that is
with respect to syntactic rank) may or may not constitute clauses. The question thus is,
which criteria can be used to illustrate that each verb in a sequence syntactically functions
as a clause.","[202, 203, 204, 205]"

"6Chapter 1includes a short word list. Elmberg’s PhD dissertation, ‘Balance and circulation: aspects of
tradition and change among the Mejprat of Irian Barat’ (1968), includes a transcription of a
myth in Maybrat. There is an extensive Maybrat-English word list which includes over
1500 lexical items. Again, no morphological information is given, but a short introduction
to the orthography gives an idea about how the language is pronounced.
The first published information about the people in Ayawasi appears in an ethnography
by H. Schoorl, ‘Mensen van de Ayfat: Ceremoniële ruil en sociale orde in Irian JayaIndonesia’ (1979).14 In the description, many Maybrat terms are included. These terms
only represent a small part of the language material Schoorl collected in Ayawasi:
extensive word lists and recordings of myths, some of which had been transcribed, were
kindly given to me when I started working on the Maybrat language.
More recently, two linguistic articles based on fieldwork in Ayamaru were published by
W.U. Brown, namely ‘Mai Brat nominal phrases’ (1990) and ‘A quantitative phonology of
Mai Brat’ (1991).
A word list including approximately 2500 lexical items in Maybrat/Indonesian/English
was published by UNCEN-SIL.15 These words are arranged according to semantic
category, and in alphabetical order. Some other works have also been published by
UNCEN-SIL: one of these is a book which includes five stories about the origins of rivers
and lakes.16 These works are also based on the Ayamaru dialect.
Recently, research has been conducted in the Bird’s Head within the framework of the
programme ‘Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’ (ISIR).17
1.6 The language
The name Maybrat (see next paragraph for this orthography)18 is morphologically a
compound noun (for an analysis of compound nouns, see §4.3.5), consisting of two
members. The first is mai, a noun meaning ‘sound’. This form can also function as a verb
stem, as in, for instance n-mai ‘You make a sound’; p-mai ‘We make a sound’. The second
part, brat, seems to refer to the type of sound, in other words, the particular language
variety. However, the isolated form brat is unattested. The people who speak Maybrat refer
to themselves as rae ro Maybrat <man REL {sound brat}> ‘the people who speak
Maybrat’. These people are subdivided into groups according to the area where they

Research by the present author has resulted in a number of publications on the Maybrat language, namely
Dol (1995; 1996; 1998; 2000). Other collections of work on the Bird’s Head include Bartstra, ed. (1998)
on geology, Miedema et. al. (1998) reporting on the results of an interdisciplinary conference on the
Bird’s Head, and Reesink (forthcoming) on languages of eastern Bird’s Head.

In §2.1.2 I point out that if [j] and [w] occur phonetically in this position, they are allophones of /i/ and /u/
respectively, and not of /y/ and /w/. Since the orthography I use is based on the phonemic structure of a
form (see §3.6), one would expect the form Maibrat. However, in spelling the name of this language as
Maybrat, I follow the orthography that the Maybrat themselves use. The forms [maj0brYt] and [maj0prYt]
vary freely, although the former is more common, hence the orthography.
15Introduction7originate, for instance, the people in Ayawasi are referred to as rae Hapeh, those of the
East Ayfat as rae Asmaun, those of Fef as rae Karon, those of Suswa as rae Mare.19 In
Ayawasi it was agreed that these people all qualified as rae ro Maybrat, since everyone
spoke the same language, although the dialects differed.
Maybrat is spoken in the kecamatans Ayfat, Ayamaru, Aytinyo, Kebar and Sausapor, of
which kecamatan Ayfat is most centrally located. The area where Maybrat is spoken
covers approximately 2570 km2 (Schoorl 1979:11).
With the establishment of schools in the area, the Indonesian language has also become
widely used. In Ayawasi, where a primary school was established in the early 1950s, many
people under 50 years of age, as well as all younger people, are bilingual in Maybrat and
Indonesian. Older people often speak Indonesian20 to some extent, but prefer to speak
Maybrat. Some older people speak no Indonesian at all. Indonesian is the standard
language in the schools, in contacts with the mission and in the Church.21 At the hospital,
Maybrat is often used by the local nurses when dealing with the elderly. In daily life, both
Maybrat and Indonesian are used, although I noted a preference for Maybrat. Children
learn the two languages simultaneously. Maybrat speakers often pepper their Maybrat with
Indonesian words (but rarely the other way around), or they switch back and forth between
Maybrat and Indonesian.22 Older members of Maybrat families who live in the cities,
usually people who grew up in a village in the interior, may use Maybrat. Their children,
however, only have a limited passive knowledge of the language.
Maybrat has a number of linguistically interesting characteristics. Morphologically,
there are two classes of nouns: those that are obligatorily prefixed for possession, namely
kinship terms and terms for body parts, and those that are not prefixed. The nouns that are
obligatorily prefixed receive person prefixes in exactly the same way as verbs.
Maybrat has an elaborate system of complex demonstratives comprising three bases
which express distance from the point of view of the speaker. Suffixes are taken according
to gender, and the choice of prefix depends on the syntactic function, its meaning, and
specificity. For instance, there are distinct prefixes to refer to specific areas as opposed to
large areas. A number of demonstratives also have derived functions, such as temporal
adverbials and anaphoric referents, while others can function as markers for locative and
temporal adverbial clauses. In the formation of interrogative forms, some of the
demonstrative prefixes are used.
The number system is based on body parts: the numbers from ‘one’ to ‘four’ are unique
terms, and these are combined with terms for hand/finger and foot/toe to form the numbers
up to ‘nineteen’.","[23, 24, 25]"
"Word classes123categorial status of a form may be unclear. This would explain why the prepositions akah
and ete can occur both in front of a noun, which is typically prepositional behaviour, and
following a noun, parallelling the behaviour of inalienably possessed nouns. Processes
whereby nouns that semantically refer to space undergo a change in morphosyntactic status
are well attested in other languages (cf. Heine et al. 1991:3, 136; Svorou 1993:100–101).
But akah and ete are not the only forms that show ‘prepositional’ behaviour. In the
previous sections, I showed that ‘to’, ‘to+directional’ and ‘to+spatial noun’ can all be
followed by a noun. A summary of forms is given below:
(344)y-amo to
Sorong
3M-go LOC Sorong
‘He goes to Sorong.’(345)au ø-hren to-tis
amah
3U ø-sit
LOC-behind house
‘She sits behind the house.’(346)t-se
to
m-ato
lemari
1S-place LOC 3U-hole cupboard
‘I place it inside the cupboard.’4.9 Coordinators
Coordinators are words that are used to link clauses. In Maybrat, the following
coordinators can be identified:
(347)mati
na
ke
mi
re‘and then’
‘and then’
‘because’
‘so that’
‘in order to’These coordinators all occur as free morphemes. Semantically, mati and na indicate
sequentiality of actions; ke, mi and re mark purpose and reason relationships between
clauses. Some examples of these coordinators in a sentence are:
(348)t-amo Sorong mati
ø-tim am
1S-go Sorong and.then ø-send letter
‘I go to Sorong and then I send a letter.’(349)m-aut

‘I go to the hospital in order for the sister to look at my foot.’The syntactic behaviour of coordinators is further discussed in §9.1.
4.10 Subordinate clause markers
There are two types of subordinate clause markers, namely a relative clause (RC)
marker and adverbial clause markers.
4.10.1 Relative clauses
Relative clauses follow a noun head, and are marked by ro. An example is:
(353)aof ro ana m-fat
sago REL 3P 3U-fell
‘the sago tree that they fell’The RC marker ro in these constructions is homophonous to the possessive marker ro,
(see §4.1.2).
(354)amah ro-Yan
house POSS-Yan
‘Yan’s house’It is possible that the possessive marker ro- and the RC marker ro are related. Both may
in turn be related to the demonstrative prefixes re-/ro-. I will discuss the possible
relationship between these re’s and ro’s in §5.4, after a detailed description of possessive
constructions and relative clause constructions.
4.10.2 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are those that modify a main clause. There are three types of
adverbial clauses in Maybrat, namely temporal adverbial clauses, locative adverbial
clauses and manner adverbial clauses. All these clauses are marked by an adverbial clause
marker. There are two forms that have as their sole function to mark adverbial clauses,
namely the locative adverbial clause marker wo-re and the manner adverbial clause marker
fi-re. An example of each is presented below:
(355)ana m-suoh wo-re
fra m-hu
3P 3U-clean LOC.GEN-PART stone 3U-stay
‘They clean where the stone is.’(356)n-fot
fi-re
tuo t-fot
fi-f-o
2-catch similar.to-PART 1S 1S-catch similar.to-very.near-U
‘Catch it like I catch it, like this.’The element wo- in wo-re is obviously related to the demonstrative prefix we-, which
also expresses location. Likewise, fi- in fi-re is related to the demonstrative prefix fi-, given
that they are formally and semantically identical. It is possible that the element -re in wo-reWord classes125and fi-re is related to the demonstrative prefix re-. The possible relationship between these
elements is considered in §9.2.1, after the discussion on temporal adverbial clauses.
Other forms that can function as adverbial clause markers are derived from other word
classes. For instance, to-yo and wo-yo, formally interrogatives, can also function as
locative adverbial clause markers. An example is:
(357)men
tuo t-not
yoyo
wo-yo
t-amo
tomorrow 1s 1s-think continuously location.GEN-INT 1s-go
‘Tomorrow I will continuously think (of you) wherever I go.’Adverbial clauses, and their markers, are discussed in §9.2.
4.11 Enumerator
The class of enumerators comprises only one element, namely o ‘ENUM’. The element o
is used in enumerations, that is when listing items or events. The element o intonationally
occurs in constituent-final position, and a small pause separates o and the following NP.
The element o need not necessarily occur in the last NP in an enumeration. This is
illustrated in (358):69
(358)t-ao
o
# t-ano
o
# ku
ø-kiniah m-ama
1S-sibling.SS ENUM
1S-sibling.OS ENUM
child ø-small 3U-come
‘My siblings of the same sex, my siblings of the opposite sex, small children,
they come.’The element o can also function as a coordinating conjunction between two clauses:
(359)na
m-kuk
intape o
m-kuk ara o
and.then 3U-pull rope
ENUM 3U-pull tree ENUM
‘Then he pulls a rope and he pulls a tree.’4.12 Interjections and particles
There are a number of forms that are commonly used as interjections, that is forms that
do not enter into a syntactic relation of any kind (Crystal 1991:180). Intonationally,
interjections are followed by a pause. Some are given below, with their approximate
meanings:
(360)ae
e
ehe
ka
pa
a‘yes’
‘hey’
‘no’
‘eh?’
‘eh’
‘mmm’Some examples are:69In some dialects, when eliciting words from a list (for instance during surveys), o is added by informants
after each reply given. In this context, the pitch drops sharply on the o, indicating that o is in utterancefinal position.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"

9.1.4 Purpose
The coordinator re ‘in order to’ introduces a purpose clause. Intonationally, re belongs
to the clause expressing purpose, and it occurs in clause-initial position. A purpose clause
follows the clause which describes the action which is undertaken to effectuate the
intention expressed in the purpose clause. Some examples follow:
(38)t-amo amah ø-kiyám / re
suster m-he
t-aò

used as a bride-price.
Wehati is a ceremonial item, but it is not clear what it refers to. The informant I translated this text with
said it was no longer used.
In this sentence the object, i.e. the enumerated NPs, is topicalised (see §6.6).","[248, 249]"
"Word classes95possessive constructions, in which y-atem and ø-wai are inalienably possessed nouns.
Apart from the fact that these b-forms are semantically different from the nouncompounds, they are formally different as well: the b-forms allow insertion of a pause, and
the order of constituents is modifier-head, as opposed to head-modifier in the a-forms.

and forms where the verb functions attributively (194b) or predicatively (194c), a
difference can be made. Unlike in compound nouns, in forms where the verb functions
attributively, the noun and the verb can be separated by a pause without changing the
meaning of the utterance. Inserting a pause between the noun and the verb in a compound
noun results in a change of meaning, as illustrated in (195):

refer to the same type of tree.","[112, 113]"

"Introduction13During the time I stayed in Ayawasi, a number of other researchers from the ISIR
project lived there for shorter or longer periods as well. I worked together closely with Avé
(ethnobotany), and we sometimes collected data together. Polak (botany), Avé and I also
assisted each other with the translations and interpretations of names of plants that the
botanists had collected, and we regularly interpreted other data we received together. Odé
visited in order to assist me in the analysis of a phonetic problem (see §2.1.3, footnote20
and §3.1.3, footnote3).
The present book aims to give an overview of the phonology, morphology and syntax of
the Maybrat language as it is spoken by the people of Ayawasi. Ideally, this work can be
used as a reference grammar: it gives information about the most important structural and
typological aspects of Maybrat. With this in mind, the grammar is full of illustrative
examples centred around contrasts in form and meaning, which are discussed in the text.
The work, which is mainly descriptive, draws on insights formulated by Dik (1987, 1997),
Givón (1984, 1990) and Shopen (1985). Many ideas for the description come from
typological work by Foley (1986), Comrie (1989), Croft (1990) and Hopper and Traugott
(1993). The terminology is kept as neutral as possible: less traditional terms are clearly
defined before they are used.","[30, 31]"

"174Chapter 66.9.5 Other semantic negatives
The negators peroh ‘wrong’ and kayie ‘it is not’, introduced in §4.7.5, can semantically
negate an assertion. In the following examples, kayie ‘negates’ an NP. Intonationally, it
belongs to the NP, and it is followed by a pause:
(195)Koru kayiè / m-tut m-ama m-hu fte tuoh Pamai
Koru not
3U-all 3U-come 3U-stay area place Pamai
‘It was not Koru (where they went), they all came and lived at an area

‘Not Anton, Atafonit, the old one, is the one who died at the foot of the
ironwood tree.’
The negator peroh is preceded by sentence-final intonation of the previous sentence and
a pause, and followed by yet another pause. Syntactically then, it is an interjection.34 The
assertion that precedes peroh is the one that is denied. Some examples appear below. As
indicated, in example (197), the speakers of each sentence are different people, that is, the
speaker of the second sentence corrects the speaker of the first sentence.

Interrogation is discussed in the next chapter.
34The clause1756.10 Clausal determiner
The form fo (but not to and no) can function as a clausal determiner. In this function, it
marks the clause boundary. A clausal determiner makes the clause more ‘definite’: it
becomes a ‘given’ in the discourse and draws attention to the clause. The clausal
determiner fo is glossed as ‘DET’.
The identification of a clausal determiner is somewhat problematic. Clausal determiners
occur strictly in clause-final position, and they are usually left untranslated. They can be
defined negatively: they are not attributive demonstratives, aspect adverbials or anaphoric
referents.
An example involving a clausal determiner appears in (200). This sentence, taken from
a narrative ‘sets the stage’ for the rest of the narrative. It is important that the listener picks
up the information in the clause, and it is therefore marked with fo.
(200)na pi
ait ø-tutu fò
/
then man 3M ø-chase DET
‘It is given that then the man chases.’The distinction between fo as a clausal determiner and fo as an aspect adverbial (see
§6.8.3) is fuzzy, as both occur in clause-final position. Theoretically, the two forms can cooccur, as indicated in example (201), but forms like these are unattested in natural speech.
The clausal determiner invariably occurs clause-finally.

So far, I have discussed demonstratives in several different functions, namely as
determiners in an NP (§5.1.6), as temporal adverbials (§6.8.1), as manner adverbials
(§6.8.2) and as location adverbials (§6.8.6). In this section I would like to illustrate the
function of demonstratives as anaphoric referents.
The demonstrative forms f-o and t-o can function anaphorically to refer to items in the
discourse that are already known. They are particular examples of what Himmelmann
refers to as ‘tracking use’ that is reference to entities that have already been introduced in
the discourse, and which help the listener to keep track of the story (Himmelmann
1996:240). The anaphoric use of deictic elements is common in Papuan languages,176Chapter 6although many of these languages seem to use the far deictic (which in Maybrat would be
-n- ‘far’) anaphorically (Reesink 1987:216).
The sentences in examples (204) and (205) are from a fairy tale. In (204) f-o,
underlined, functions anaphorically, referring back to ku m-ana eok re-f-o ‘these two
children’, which are introduced at the beginning of the example:

m-ana s-aux ‘the one’ and m-ana s-auy ‘the other’ (both enclosed in square brackets):

the speaker is expressed. Traditionally, a distinction is made between three basic types of
mood, namely interrogative, imperative and declarative. In the interrogative mood, the
speaker expresses a wish for information. In the imperative mood, the speaker expresses a
command or gives an instruction. The declarative mood can be defined negatively,
that is speech acts that are not interrogative or imperative are declarative (cf. Lyons
1968:307–308).
So far, the description of Maybrat has centred around simple declarative statements or,
in other words, statements in the indicative mood. In this short chapter, I will discuss two
moods that are grammatically marked, namely the interrogative mood and the imperative
mood. Interrogatives either contain an interrogative marker (polar questions and alternative
questions) or a question word (content questions). Imperatives are characterised by the
presence of an imperative marker re ‘please’ or by a distinct intonation pattern. The form
mai ‘PROHIB’ (prohibitive) marks the prohibitive. Syntactically, statements in the indicative
mood are unmarked.1
7.1 Interrogative
A distinction can be made between three types of question, namely polar questions,
alternative questions and content questions. Intonationally, all types of question behave in
the same way as other clauses, that is there is a fall in pitch towards the end of the clause.2
7.1.1 Polar questions
Polar questions, or Yes/No questions, are characterised by the presence of the interrogative
marker a in clause-final position. No variations in word order are required. Some examples
are given in (1)–(4). Examples (3)–(4) illustrate that the clausal periphery precedes the
interrogative marker. In each case the scope of the interrogator is the entire clause.
12Given that I assume that ‘mood’ is concerned with the attitude of the speaker, the category of ‘pseudoquotatives’, i.e. constructions which include the verb -awe ‘say’ and which express the thought content of
the speaker, could also be described here. However, pseudo-quotative constructions cannot be formally
distinguished from indirect speech forms, which also include -awe ‘say’. Because a formal distinction
cannot be made, pseudo-quotatives are described together with forms involving -awe in Chapter 8.
This is unusual, as according to the universalist view, questions are typically associated with a higher
pitch (see Ladd 1996:113–115).","[191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"

3U-good
‘Ayawasi that he sends a letter to is nice.’However, in example (152), extraction of the object of the third verb, tapam ‘land’ was
always considered acceptable, see for example (152c). Apparently tapam ‘land’ can be
understood as the topic of the RC. It is difficult to find a semantic motivation for the
unacceptability of (150b), and for the acceptability of (152c). It seems that in sequences
with three verbs, it cannot be completely predicted whether the object of a verb can or
cannot be extracted.

‘The ground on which he fells the sago tree and it breaks and crashes is
very muddy.’In sequences of two verbs, of which one is a motion verb, a position verb, or a shared
argument construction verb, the first object can be extracted. Likewise, in ‘valencyincreasing’ constructions, the argument that functions as the object of the first verb and the
subject of the second verb can be extracted. Apparently, all these verbs, when combined220Chapter 8with other verbs, yield constructions from which objects can be extracted without giving
rise to ‘logical conflicts’ and hence unacceptability.
In other words, these constructions seem similar to two types of construction discussed
before: they are similar to coordinating constructions from the point of view of intonation,
and morphology, and they behave largely the same when placed in the interrogative mood.
However, these forms violate the CSC. This makes them similar to the constructions
involving an object complement, which also ‘violate’ the CSC. Indeed, in many of the
problematic constructions the second clause can be analysed as an object complement of
the first clause, as illustrated below (see also the examples in §8.3):
(153) a.b.(154) a.b.ø-hren [[t-kom

‘I sit and write a letter.’

m-amo [[m-ate
aya]]
3U-go 3U-go.under water
‘She goes and bathes.’
m-amo [[aya]]
3U-go water
‘She goes to the river.’However, in §8.3 I illustrated that in constructions involving an object complement, a
pause between the two verbs can bring about a significant change in meaning. This is not
the case for these ‘problematic’ verb sequences. Thus, according to the criteria set in this
chapter, they keep a middle way between coordinating constructions and constructions
involving an object complement.
A case could be made for the presence of serial verb constructions in Maybrat. In what
are claimed to be serialising languages, the motion verbs ‘come’ and ‘go’ and the position
verbs ‘stand’ and ‘stay’ are commonly found in serial verb constructions (Foley & Olson
1985:41–42). The same is true for a verb like -o, which expresses a semantic function
similar to ‘instrumental’ (Sebba 1987:162). Likewise, ‘shared argument’ constructions,
such as ‘X kills Y dies’, as in example (145) above, are common in serialising languages
(Sebba 1987:197). Hamel (1993) refers to this type of construction as ‘causative/result’
where the main verb is the cause, and the serial verb is the result. And lastly, serialising
languages often use ‘valency-increasing’ constructions to make it possible to add an extra
argument to an expression (Foley & Olson 1985:48; Sebba 1987:216; Zwicky 1990:3).
The question is if the constructions discussed in this section really qualify as ‘serial’.
The term ‘serial verb construction’ itself has been the subject of much debate in recent
linguistic literature. Zwicky (1990:2) states that the term ‘serial’ is often used to refer to
juxtaposed verbs in general, without stating explicitly the relationship between these verbs.
Thus, if taken loosely, all the sequences of verbs in this chapter qualify as serial. However,
in the literature the term ‘serial’ is usually applied to a specific type of verb series. Some
formal criteria that apply to ‘serial verb constructions’ are as follows:Sequences of verbs
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)221They have only one overtly expressed (syntactic) subject (Sebba 1987:86).
There must be no ascertainable clause boundary between the two verbs
(Sebba 1987:39).
There cannot be any overt conjunctions between the verbs (Zwicky 1990:4;
Foley & Olson 1985:18; Sebba 1987:39).
All the verbs have the same aspect, tense and mood (Zwicky 1990:4; Foley &
Olson 1985:28; Sebba 1987:39).
Verbs in a serial verb construction must also be able to occur as single
predicates.
The serial verbs refer to one single event (Comrie 1995:26).","[237, 238, 239]"
"208Chapter 8Semantically, the two differ slightly: in example (102a) the verb -ae is adequately
translated as ‘to be at’, as indicated in the English translation. In (102b) m-ae has little
semantic content: its function is that of a pointer which marks the following NP as a
location. The difference between these two kinds of -ae has consequences for its
intonational and syntactic behaviour: a sequence of a verb followed by m-ae cannot be
dominated by two intonation contours without rendering the utterance ungrammatical,13 as
illustrated in (103). The same applies to insertion of the overt coordinator mati, as in (104).

‘declining’ forms are similar to coordinating constructions, the defective paradigm
instances are different. I will return to the notion that a lexical item, like this defectiveparadigm verb -ae, is formally like a verb, but is functionally more like a preposition in the
following section.
8.4.1 Another note on ‘prepositions’
In §4.2.3.5 I showed that with the exception of -ae, the prepositional verbs cannot
function as main verbs in a clause although two of them, -kit and -pat, do take person
prefixes like regular verbs. In §8.4 I illustrated that, when placed in a sequence with other
verbs, the resulting sequences behave differently from coordinating sequences of verbs.
13Unless there is a rise in pitch on the first verb followed by a pause, in which case m-ae hanggar would be
emphasised, see (87)–(90).
14
It may seem odd that the b-form below is acceptable, as opposed to (105b) and (106b) which are not. A
possible explanation is that in the example below m-ae Ayawasi is interpreted as a separate clause, where
m-ae functions as a main verb:
a. ana m-amo m-ae Ayawasi
b. [[Ayawasi ro

3P 3U-go 3U-at Ayawasi
Ayawasi REL 3U-go

‘They go to Ayawasi.’
‘Ayawasi, that they go to, is near Ayata.’Sequences of verbs209Prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other verbs, with m-kah as the most
remarkable form, since its verbal character is debatable to begin with (see §4.2.3.5 for the
arguments to classify it as a verb).
Prepositional notions that are expressed by forms which are verbal in character to a
greater or lesser extent are found in many (serialising) languages. Lord (1973) finds that in
a number of Kwa languages, spoken in West Africa, some prepositions evolved from
locative verbs in a serial construction. Hamel (1993), in her description of Loniu, an
Oceanic language, finds that oblique roles such as locatives, causatives and instrument/
manner constructions are expressed by prepositions that are derived from verbs, but have
lost some of their verbal properties. Schachter (1974:265) states that verbs that occur in
serial verb constructions often lose their verbal characteristics resulting in a
‘reinterpretation as prepositions’. Disregarding for the moment the question of whether the
verb sequences described in the present section qualify as ‘serial verb constructions’ (I will
return to this in §8.7 and §8.8), the behaviour of Maybrat prepositional verbs is, from a
typological point of view, not unusual.
The question is whether these verbs should be analysed as prepositions or as verbs. Lord
(1993) gives a number of criteria that have to be met for a verbal form to qualify as a
preposition (Lord 1993:14). These criteria refer to the extent to which such verbal forms
are verbal in behaviour. In Maybrat, -ae can function as a main verb, whereas -kit, -pat and
-kah cannot. However, Lord states that objects of verbs can be extracted, whereas those of
prepositions cannot. According to this criterion then, -kit and -pat are more ‘verbal’ than
-ae and -kah, as the former two verbs allow relativisation of their objects more easily than
the latter two verbs. Likewise, -kit and -pat are more verbal than -ae and -kah because of
their ability to select nouns as subjects: as was illustrated above, -ae is sometimes, and
-kah is always a ‘defective paradigm’ verb. The ability to select a noun as a subject, which
with the exception of -kah all verbs clearly can do, is another property associated with
verbs, according to Lord.
It is clear that the ‘prepositional’ verbs in Maybrat are not exclusively prepositions, but
at the same time, they are not exclusively verbs, as they do not fully exhibit some of the
properties that are so typical of ‘real’ Maybrat verbs, such as the ability to function as a
main verb and the ability to take person prefixes.
8.5 Comitatives
The comitative verb -sia was introduced in §4.2.3.6. There, I stated that -sia takes both
a subject and an object, and that it cannot function as a main verb. In this section, I will
discuss the syntactic behaviour of comitative constructions.
Formally, -sia is a verb which takes two arguments. The person prefix of -sia must be
coreferent with the subject of the verb. The forms below are NPs: they cannot function as
predicates.

‘go’ takes a first person singular person prefix t-. Conversely, in (109b), the main verb
takes a plural person prefix p- whilst in (110), there is also subject agreement. In this
example, the comitative is considered part of the subject, hence the plural case marking.
This type of comitative is more common in Papuan languages (see Reesink 1987:85).

"The clause1516.8 Adverbials
The function of adverbials in the clause is to modify or specify an event expressed by
the predicate (see §4.7). Adverbials occur in the ‘periphery’ of the clause. In Maybrat
peripheral constituents can be syntactically defined as ‘any constituent which is not a head
or a subject or object argument’. Peripheral constituents are constituents that specify the
spatial or temporal setting of an event (cf. Foley & Olson 1985:36).
In the discussion of the periphery, I will make a distinction between different types of
adverbials, based on syntactic and semantic criteria. The section will begin with the
periphery that precedes the predicate in a clause, that is the temporal periphery (§6.8.1).
Subsequently, the peripheries that occur in clause-final position are described, namely the
manner (§6.8.2), aspect (§6.8.3), and focus (§6.8.4) periphery. Apart from the adverbs
introduced in §4.7, these peripheries can also include items that formally belong to other
word classes, but can function as adverbials. In §6.8.6 I will discuss the location periphery.
Negation is described in §6.9. Clausal determiners and anaphoric reference are treated in
§6.10 and §6.11 respectively.
6.8.1 Time
In the temporal periphery, the question of ‘when’ the action described in the clause took
place or will take place is answered. The temporal periphery precedes s-V in a clause, as
illustrated in example (43). If the subject of a clause is also expressed by a full NP, then the
temporal adverbial may either precede this subject, or follow it, as illustrated in (44). The
difference in meaning between these two forms is, according to informants, negligible. The
scope of the temporal adverbial is the entire clause that follows.
(43)is

‘Yesterday he came from Konya.’(44) a.pi

‘The man hid there just now.’b.ira
pi
ait y-apum au
just.now man 3M 3M-hide U.DIST
‘Just now the man hid there.’Temporal adverbs can be combined, in order to make time reference more specific. The
mutual ordering of the two time adverbs does not seem to be crucial, given the examples in
(47) and (48): in (47) the temporal adverbial is tian pose, while in (48) it is pose tian.

clause. In addition, there are a number of numerals and demonstratives which can function
as temporal adverbials.
Many languages have temporal deictic forms which are derived from, or based on,
spatial demonstratives (Anderson & Keenan 1985:297–300; Heine et al. 1991:31). In
Maybrat the demonstrative me-f-o can function as a temporal adverbial.10 Some examples
are:
(49)me-f-ot-ait
po-iit
PRESTT-very.near-U 1S-eat NOM-eat.P
‘Now I’m eating food.’(50)Mafif y-awe, me-f-o

ø-farkor m-ae Jayapura
Agus PRESTT-very.near-U ø-study 3U-at Jayapura
‘Agus is studying at Jayapura now.’Likewise, the directional tis ‘behind’ and the complex directional to-tis ‘LOC-behind’
can occur in the temporal periphery of a clause. In this function, tis is adequately translated
as ‘finally’, and to-tis as ‘in the end’. Both notionally refer to time:
(52)m-nan
tis
m-nies
ro y-api t-a
ø-sruer
after.this finally 3U-smell REL 3M-big near-U ø-scattered
‘After this, finally, he smells the big one which lies scattered (on the ground).’(53)to-tis
ait y-no po
m-of
LOC-behind 3m 3m-do thing 3u-good
‘In the end he does well.’ (lit. ‘In the end he does good things.’)Below, an example of a nominal clause modified by to-tis is given:
(54)10to-tis
y-ana
s-ait
ku
sme
LOC-behind 3M-head one-3M child male
‘The last one is a boy.’I noted one instance of the demonstrative we-f-o functioning as a temporal adverbial:
we-f-o
anu p-he
apan potafit
sawiah m-apuf
location.GEN-very.near-U 1P 1P-see {snake potafit} ø-tail 3U-short
‘Now we see that the potafit snake has a short tail.’The clause153Some NPs that notionally refer to time, such as snie ‘month’ or tein ‘year’ can function
as temporal adverbials. These NPs can be modified by a numeral (55)–(57), and, if the
head is snie ‘month’, by the name of the month (58):
(55)snie
tuf
Fince m-ape
ku
month three Fince 3U-give.birth child
‘In three months Fince will give birth.’(56)tein s-au

‘In two months it will rain again.’(58)snie
Maret ana ø-skie amah m-arak
month March 3P ø-build house 3U-empty
‘In March they will finish building the house.’The expression um sau, as in (59), is an idiomatic expression, used to introduce a new
story. It is adequately translated as ‘once upon a time’.
(59)um
s-au
eok m-ros
m-kah

‘Once upon a time the two stand and burn a garden.’(60)um
s-au
arin
mti oh …
moment one-3U situation night already
‘Once upon a time, it is already night …’As already illustrated in §4.7.1, numerals can also be used as time adverbials. In
practice, only the numerals from ‘three’ to ‘six’ are used in this function. To refer to a time
span larger than six days, the Indonesian term Hari Minggu ‘Sunday’ is used. ‘Sundays’
can be modified by a numeral to refer to the number of weeks. Some examples are:
(61)Hari Minggu s-au
amu p-mo ø-twok sembahyang’
{Sunday}
one-3U 1P 1P-go.P ø-enter pray
‘On one (a particular) Sunday, we go and enter and pray.’(62)Hari Minggu tuf t-amo Negeri Belanda
u
{Sunday}
three 1S-go {The Netherlands} again
‘After three Sundays I will go to The Netherlands again.’In example (63) the nominal clause waro fi-f-o ‘a little while, like this’, places the
action described in the clause in time. In other words, waro fi-f-o functions like a temporal
adverbial.
(63)au m-aut

waro fi-f-o
aya
m-aut
3U 3U-climb and.then little similar.to-very.near-U water 3U-climb
‘She climbs, and in a little while like this, the water rises.’154Chapter 66.8.2 Manner
In the manner periphery, questions about ‘the way in which’ or ‘how’ an event takes
place are answered. Manner adverbials occur in clause-final position, and their scope is the
entire clause they modify. Some examples follow:
(64)anu n-no
iso f-o
kaket
2P 2-make road very.near-U well
‘You build this road well.’(65)ait y-awia toro
3M 3M-cry many.times
‘He cries many times.’(66)rae
pris11 pose
m-atak
mimo
person police long.time.ago 3U-angry very
‘A long time ago, the policemen were very angry.’(67)n-amo rere
2-go
carefully
‘Go carefully.’In the examples above, the manner periphery is filled by manner adverbs, introduced in
§4.7.2. The occurrence of manner adverbs is restricted to the manner periphery of a clause.
The manner periphery can also be filled by forms that function as manner adverbials,
but formally belong to other word classes. The reason for analysing these forms as manner
adverbials is twofold: firstly, like the other manner adverbs, they occur in clause-final
position, thus taking the same syntactic position as manner adverbs. Secondly, they
stipulate how the action referred to in the clause is carried out, in other words, they have
the same semantic content as manner adverbials. A distinction can be made between two
types of ‘functional manner adverbials’, namely non-verbal forms and verbal forms. The
non-verbal forms are listed in (68). With the exception of rere, all are morphologically
complex.
(68)rere ‘carefully’
– demonstrative forms prefixed with fi- (see §4.4.2)
– emphatic pronouns, that is pronouns prefixed with po- (see §4.1.3)Rere, when it occurs in clause-initial position, functions as a temporal adverbial
meaning ‘shortly’, as illustrated in (69) (see §4.7.1). In clause-final position rere functions
as a manner adverbial meaning ‘carefully’, as in (70) and (71):
(69)rere

‘Shortly we will go and bathe.’(70)au m-wian

Morphologically, verbs can be defined as those words that take obligatory person
prefixes. Under certain circumstances this prefix is not phonologically realised due to
morphophonological constraints. These constraints, as well as paradigms of declined verbs,
have already been discussed in §3.1. In this section, we also illustrated that verbs and
inalienably possessed nouns are morphologically identical. Some paradigms representative
of all the different morphophonological paradigms of verbs are given in (35) for the sake
of convenience:

ø-frokBecause verbs and inalienably possessed nouns are morphologically identical, we need
to use a syntactic criterion to distinguish these two categories: syntactically, verbs are
words that can function as a minimal predicate. The person prefix is coreferent with the
subject of the clause. In (36) this subject is not expressed as an NP, while in (37) it is (see
§6.3 for a discussion on subject NPs in clauses).
(36)y-amo
3M-go
‘He goes.’(37)rae y-amo
man 3M-go
‘The man goes.’Word classes69Only three forms are attested without a person prefix for reasons other than
morphophonological ones, namely -akus ‘left.behind’, -rof ‘follow’ and -roh ‘descend’. In
constructions in which these prefixless verbs feature, they are invariably directly preceded
by an overtly or covertly inflected verb. An example of -akus functioning as an
(intransitive) main verb is given in (38a), which consists of two clauses separated by a
comma. Example (39b) includes the same verb, but without a person prefix:
(38) a.b.rae m-e
biskui, tuo t-akus
man 3U-give biscuit 1S 1S-leave.behind
‘The people give biscuits, I’m left out.’ (i.e. I don’t get any)
t-se
akus
sasu
1S-place left.behind sweet.potato
‘I place the sweet potato and leave it behind temporarily.’In constructions like (38b), the bare-stem verb functions as an adverbial, that is it
modifies or specifies the preceding verb. These constructions are described in detail in
§8.2.
In compound nouns of the type N+V, where V is an ‘adjectival verb’, a person prefix
may also be omitted (see §4.3.5).
4.2.1 Classes of verbs
In §3.1, I distinguished between a number of morphological classes of verbs. In this
section I will make a subdivision according to syntactic criteria. A straightforward
distinction between the classes of verbs is made according to transitivity: intransitive verbs
can only receive one argument, whereas transitive verbs can take two arguments. However,
transitivity is not the only criterion for the classification of verbs, as a more subtle
grouping can be made. For example, in the class of intransitive verbs a class of ‘adjectival’
verbs, which can function attributively in an NP, can be identified. Likewise, in the class of
transitive verbs, the ability of verbs to take certain types of objects has syntactic
consequences for their behaviour in sequences of verbs.
Intransitive verbs are discussed in §4.2.2, followed by a discussion of transitive verbs in
§4.2.3. Within these sections, the various subclasses are introduced. I will give examples of
each type of verb in a clause, and refer to the relevant sections in Chapter 6 (on the clause)
and Chapter 8 (on sequences of verbs) for more detailed syntactic motivations according to
which these subclasses can be defined.
4.2.2 Intransitive verbs
The only argument that an intransitive verb can take is a subject. There are three classes
of intransitive verbs, namely regular intransitive verbs, adjectival verbs, and quantifying
verbs. Each class is discussed in turn below.
4.2.2.1 Regular intransitive verbs
The class of regular intransitive verbs includes verbs that can only function
predicatively. This is illustrated in (50) below. Examples of typically intransitive verbs are:70Chapter 4(39)-awe
-haf
-hai
kron
ksie
-tie‘fall’
‘pregnant’
‘die’
‘sound’
‘sneeze’
‘break (sticks)’Some of these intransitive verbs can be made transitive by attaching the derivative
prefix -i- TRANS (see §4.2.4).
Some clauses featuring intransitive verbs are:
(40)rae y-atiet
man 3M-perish
‘The man perishes.’(41)smai tapam m-o
{bean land}9 3U-grow
‘The peanuts grow.’An apparent exception in the series of intransitive verbs is the expression -hai awiah ‘to
be hungry’, given in (42).10 The form -hai awiah here suggests that an intransitive verb
receives a nominal object. However, this object is not a regular nominal object, as it cannot
be extracted through relativisation, as illustrated in (43).11 This suggests that the expression
-hai awiah is an idiomatic term which functions as one single syntactic unity.
(42)y-hai awiah
3M-die taro
‘He is hungry.’(43)*awiah ro y-hai m-api
REL 3M-die 3U-big
taro4.2.2.2 Adjectival verbs
Adjectival verbs are verbs that can function predicatively in a clause, as well as
attributively in an NP. Semantically, they express typically ‘adjectival’ notions, such as
dimension (‘big’, ‘small’, ‘thick’ etc.), physical property (‘hard’, ‘soft’, ‘heavy’, ‘light’
etc.), colour (‘black’, ‘white’, ‘red’ etc.), value (‘good’, ‘bad’ etc.) (Dixon 1977:31). It is
not unusual for a language to show a convergence between verbal and adjectival notions,
so that both are expressed in one word class, usually that of ‘verb’ (Dixon 1977). Some
examples of adjectival verbs, given in antonym pairs are:9Smai tapam is a compound noun: compound nouns are separated by a single space in the text, and
enclosed between braces in the glosses (see §4.3.5).
10
This expression is the only term attested to express hunger, i.e. it does not apply just to a desire to eat
awiah ‘taro’.

In the spoken text there is a pause between au ø-sokuos and y-me fo ø-sokuos. The speaker started his
sentence again to make the referent, y-me ‘his mother’ more explicit.
12
Po aof ‘sago thing’ refers to the treebark, which will be used as a bowl to stir the sago later on.
13
The verb -tu ‘pour’ refers to the fact that in order to make sago porridge, boiling water has to be poured
onto the sago while stirring vigorously. The stirring of the sago, while it is still in liquid form, is referred
to as -som ‘play’ (line 23). The stirred mixture of water and sago then ‘runs’, -hoh (line 25). The instant
the mixture becomes porridge is called aof m-hai, lit. ‘The sago dies’ (line 26).
14
Here, a temporal adverbial receives a subject prefix. M-orie is used predicatively, and is adequately
translated as an interjection meaning ‘Wait!’.
15
M-akan m-ah literally means ‘seeds appear’.

19
Y-pron is an irregular form, since it receives an overt person prefix. According to the morphophonological
constraints stated in §3.1.2, this form should receive a covert person prefix.
20
The water is heated in bamboo. In order to pour it out, the bamboo has to be lifted up with two hands and
held horizontally and tilted slowly down towards the open end in order to pour out the water, hence the
form -awah ‘lift (with two hands)’.

and people. To begin with, I thank NWO: research for this dissertation was conducted
within the framework of the NWO (Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research)
priority programme ‘The Irian Jaya Studies: a programme for interdisciplinary research’
(ISIR), financed by WOTRO (Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Tropical
Research). Secondly, I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the ‘Pusat Pembinaan
dan Pengembangan Bahasa’, for acting as my sponsor, enabling me to carry out fieldwork
in Indonesia, and the ‘Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia’ (LIPI), under whose auspices
the research was carried out. I am indebted to Han Schoorl for kindly giving me all the
language material that he collected while he was in Ayawasi in the early seventies for his
anthropological research, as well as background information about people in the village
before I went there. The Roman Catholic Missionaries in Sorong, particularly the
Augustinian Fathers P. Tuyp, T. Tromp and F. Jonkergouw, were always hospitable, and
helped to solve many logistic problems. Likewise, my thanks are due to Father B.
Ngamelubun and Father J. Fatem in Ayawasi, as well as to the Sisters of the ‘Ordo Sancto
Franciscus’ (OSF), who initially put me up in Ayawasi, and were always there when I
needed them.
I am greatly indebted to all the people in Ayawasi and other villages for helping me to
gather data. I would especially like to thank Didimus Bame and Yan Piter Tenau, who
assisted me with many transcriptions of the recorded material, and Petrus Turot, my main
informant, for his time, his understanding, his lucid explanations and, most of all, his
patience. I thank Elisabeth (Lys) Korain, Maria Fanataf, and Yuliana Yumte for their
friendship, and the latter especially for refusing to speak Indonesian to me. I hope that this
description will do some justice to the Maybrat language, and will reflect the enthusiasm
with which everyone in the village taught me. I am also grateful to Marcel Polak and his
family and to Colin Ridsdale for their collegiality and comraderie while we were doing
fieldwork. I am particularly grateful to Wanda Avé, the ethnobotanist, for all the work we
did, and still do, together and for her warm friendship.
An earlier version of this work was submitted as a doctoral dissertation at the University
of Leiden, and was defended on September 15, 1999. I am very grateful to my supervisor
Ger Reesink, who supported me throughout the various stages of this work. His critical and
detailed comments have been invaluable, and it was he who taught me how to approach
descriptive linguistics. My promoter, Wim Stokhof, continuously cheered me on and
provided many useful comments in the final stages of this research. I would like to express
especially warm thanks to Bert Voorhoeve, our ‘veteran’ Papuanist and descriptive
linguist, who always managed to come up with questions and details that no one else came
xxi
up with, and which eventually greatly improved this work. Cecilia Odé helped me with the
phonetic analysis of my data both in the field and in the Netherlands: I am grateful for that,
and for our friendship that resulted from travelling and working together. In the final stages
of this work Professor C.L. Ebeling provided many detailed comments which have saved
me from some considerable phonological and other linguistic blunders. I thank Lourens de
Vries for evaluating the entire manuscript and suggesting some improvements in the form
of an index and word-lists. Finally, I thank Professor T.C. Schadeberg, Colin Ewen, Gunter
Senft, Hein Steinhauer and Aone van Engelenhoven for reading the manuscript before I
defended it and providing another set of useful comments. Prior to publication of this
manuscript, an anonymous reviewer of Pacific Linguistics commented on the entire
version, which led to a number of notable improvements for which I am very grateful.
I would like to thank my colleagues at the Projects Division for their practical and moral
support throughout this project. Mary Bakker supported me with many logistic matters, not
only when I was in the field, but also at home in Leiden. I thank Raymond Menick for the
discussions we had in ‘The Lambada’ in Sorong, on linguistics in particular and The Bird’s
Head in general. Ron Habiboe made the maps, and gave many tips on how to tame the
computer. Miriam van Staden and Aglaia Cornelisse meticulously ploughed through the
manuscript, and provided me with helpful comments. Elja Dekker was always (and I mean
always) ready to answer stylistic questions, and confidently predicted the ultimate
completion of this project from the beginning onwards. I thank Ruurd for turning round the
Maybrat–English wordlist, and for being my wonderful partner and father to our daughters
Eline and Charlotte and to our son Adriaan. Last, but not least, I thank my parents, to
whom I have dedicated this work, for always letting me go my own way, while at the same
time always giving me their unconditional love and support.
Naturally, any mistakes that remain are my responsibility entirely.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"4Word classesIn the present chapter, Maybrat words are assigned to different word classes. I will
define word classes on the basis of two grammatical criteria, namely morphological and
syntactic (cf. Schachter 1985:3).
A word is the smallest unit of a sentence which has positional mobility (Cruse 1986:35)
and which cannot be interrupted by a pause (Lyons 1968:202). According to these criteria,
amah ‘house’ and fane ‘pig’ are words: they have positional mobility in the sentence and
they cannot be interrupted by a pause. By the same criteria, t-kias ‘I tell’ and re-f-o ‘this
very.near’ are words, albeit morphologically complex ones: they each consist of more than
one morpheme.
In Maybrat, the following thirteen word classes can be defined:
pronouns (person deixis)
verbs
nouns
demonstratives
question words
numerals
adverbs
location markers
directionals
coordinators
subordinate clause markers
enumerators
interjections
Person deixis is the first item to be discussed (§4.1). The reason for this early
presentation is that it can then be referred to in the subsequent discussion of the largest
(open) classes, that is those of verbs (§4.2) and nouns (§4.3). In the presentation of verbs,
the morphological properties are discussed in §4.2, and from §4.2.1 onwards the different
classes of verbs are discussed. At the end of §4.2, I will describe derivation. Section 4.3, on
nouns, begins with a discussion of inalienably possessed nouns which include kinship
terms, terms for body parts and spatial nouns, and alienably possessed nouns.
Subsequently, lexical nominalisation and compound nouns are treated. The class of
demonstratives is described in §4.4, followed by a discussion on question words in §4.5.
6162Chapter 4Following this, in §4.6, the number system, which is based on terms for body parts, is
presented. The six subclasses of adverbs, namely temporal adverbs, manner adverbs,
aspect adverbs, locative adverbs, negators and focus adverbs are discussed in §4.7. Section
4.8 covers locational forms including location markers and directionals. Finally, the
remaining word classes are presented, namely coordinators (§4.9), subordinate clause
markers (§4.10), the enumerator (§4.11), and interjections (§4.12). In each section, I will
first give the morphological characteristics (if present) of a word class, followed by
syntactic criteria in cases where morphological criteria alone are not sufficient.
There are some instances where the classes overlap. For instance, in the class of
numerals (§4.6), inalienably possessed nouns that refer to body parts, such as atem
‘hand/arm’ and krem ‘finger/toe’ (§4.3.1) are used. The demonstrative forms (§4.4)
comprise demonstrative prefixes, and some of these prefixes are also used on interrogative
forms (§4.5). The two location markers to ‘LOC’ and wo ‘LOC.GEN’ (§4.8.1) seem to be
related to demonstrative prefixes (§4.4). Likewise, the morpheme ro, which marks relative
clauses (§4.10.1), and the forms wo-re and fi-re, which mark locative and manner
adverbial clauses respectively (§4.10.2), all include morphemes that are related to
demonstrative forms. In other words, a morpheme cannot always be assigned to one single
word class.
4.1 Person deixis
Person deixis is expressed through bound personal pronouns in the form of person
prefixes on verbs and inalienably possessed nouns, and through free personal pronouns.
The free personal pronouns can be affixed with ro- ‘POSS’ and po- ‘EMPH’ to form
possessive and emphatic personal pronouns. In some emphatic forms, a numeral is used to
express person deixis. Syntactically, pronouns may be used in the place of a noun or a
noun phrase.
In §4.1.1, I will discuss the person prefixes. Following this, in §4.1.2, the possessive
pronouns are presented. In §4.1.3 the emphatic forms are introduced. Finally, in §4.1.4, I
will give other pronominal forms.
4.1.1 Person prefixes
In §3.1, I introduced the person prefixes, and the morphophonological constraints that
dictate whether or not they are phonologically expressed. The person prefixes are repeated
below:
(1)
S1
2
3M
3Ufree form
tuo
nuo
ait
aubound form
tnym-P1
2
3amu
anu
anapnm-Word classes63Possibly, the first and second person singular bound forms are derived from the
respective free forms. For the other forms, there does not seem to be an overt
morphological connection between the bound forms and the free forms. In the free forms
of the plural pronouns, the first phoneme is invariably /a/, while the second is a nasal.
Person prefixes are taken by verbs and inalienably possessed nouns. There is subject
agreement, that is in clauses the person prefix on the verb must be coreferent with the
subject of the clause — see an example in (2) — and inalienably possessed nouns take a
person prefix that agrees with the possessor of the noun (3).
(2) a.ait y-amo
3M 3M-go
‘he goes’b.nuo n-amo
2S 2-go
‘you go’(3) a.t-ana
1S-head
‘my head’b.y-ana
3M-head
‘his head’Because words from two different word classes take these person prefixes, the presence
of a person prefix cannot be used as the sole criterion to classify a word. Therefore,
syntactic criteria are needed as well, as will be illustrated in the course of the discussion on
verbs and nouns.
There is a distinction in gender, namely between masculine and unmarked in the third
person singular pronoun in both the free forms and the bound forms. Gender is according
to natural gender: masculine is used for male human and, for instance in fables, male
animate. In both cases, the referent must be singular:
(4)rae y-amo aya1
man 3M-go water
‘The man goes to the river.’(5)fane y-tien
pig 3M-sleep
‘The boar sleeps.’The unmarked bound form m- is used to refer to all third person forms that do not fall
under the heading ‘masculine human singular’, that is all other third person singular and
plural forms. Some examples:
(6)fai
m-haif
rako2
woman 3U-chop firewood
‘The woman/women chop(s) firewood.’(7)ru m-amo Senopi
bird 3U-go Senopi
‘The aeroplane/aeroplanes3 go(es) to Senopi.’(8)fane m-aku
m-som
pig 3U-small 3U-play
‘The piglet/piglets play(s).’1
2
3Aya is used to refer to ‘water’ and ‘river’. In this work, I have translated aya as ‘water’.
Rako is a lexicalised compound noun, consisting of the noun ara ‘wood’ and the verb -ko ‘burn’.
Ru ‘bird’ is also used to refer to ‘aeroplane’.","[78, 79, 80, 81]"
"Word classes85In possessive constructions where an inalienably possessed noun is the ‘possessed’, the
order of the constituents is possessor-possessed. The prefix on the inalienably possessed
noun must agree with the head noun for person and number. Some examples:
(126)Sely m-me
Sely 3U-mother
‘Sely’s mother’(127)amu p-tia
1P
1P-father.P
‘our father’(128)Simon ø-sniem
Simon ø-in.law
‘Simon’s in-law’Human or animal ‘families’ are also expressed as inalienably possessed notions. Some
examples:
(129)ait y-atin
3M 3M-group
‘his family/group’(130)fane m-sif
pig 3U-nest
‘the pig’s nest’A second group of inalienably possessed nouns are terms for body parts. This group
also includes attributes of plants and animals. Examples of prefixation on terms for body
parts are given below:
(131)

Some examples of possessive constructions involving terms for body parts:
(132)fnia
m-ao
woman 3U-foot
‘the woman’s foot’(133)Yan y-asoh
Yan 3M-mouth
‘Yan’s mouth’86Chapter 4(134)Potafit ø-krem
Potafit ø-finger
‘Potafit’s finger’Some terms for body parts of animals are -aim ‘wing’ and -awian ‘feathers/fur’.
Examples of these terms in possessive constructions:
(135)ru m-aim
bird 3U-wing
‘the bird’s wing’(136)kak
m-awian
cuscus 3U-feathers/fur
‘the cuscus’ fur’Terms for body parts include attributes of plants. Some are listed in (137). With the
exception of kre ‘branch’, all these forms are naturally marked with a third person prefix
m-. Only three of these terms are attested with different person prefixes, albeit with a
slightly different, but related, meaning: y-akan ‘his eyes’/‘his testicles’; y-arak ‘his skin’;
y-tis ‘his veins’.

seed’, m-ata ‘its leaf’ as well as the body part term m-ana ‘its head’ can function as
classifiers in an NP (see §5.1.3).
A last category of inalienably possessed nouns are the spatial nouns. Spatial nouns are
nouns that refer to relational parts of objects (Svorou 1993:83), such as ‘the inside’, ‘the
outside’, ‘the middle’ and so on. In many languages terms for spatial relations derive from
terms for body parts (see Svorou 1993; Hopper & Thompson 1984; Heine et al. 1991;
Foley 1997). In Maybrat, there are two (elicited) instances of terms for body parts that are
used to refer to a ‘spatial’ notion, namely -asu ‘face’ and soka ‘mouth’. Both terms refer to
the concept ‘front’.22 They enter into the same type of possessive relation as the other
terms for body parts, as illustrated in (147) and (148):
(147)amah m-asu
house 3U-face
‘the front of the house’(148)amah ø-soka
house ø-mouth
‘the front of the house’Other spatial nouns found in Maybrat are given in (149).
(149)m-aom
m-ato
m-asuf
m-aum
m-ur‘outside’
‘hole, inside’
‘middle’
‘border’
‘around’These nouns are formally similar: all begin with ‘m’, which coincides with the third
person unmarked person prefix. There is one form which is evidence for the fact that m- is
a person prefix. It is given in (150). Here, -ato ‘hole’ receives a third person masculine
person prefix y-. This form is taken from a text recorded by Han Schoorl in the period21
22M-arak also means ‘It is empty.’.
Other forms are unattested, e.g. *amah ø-kpor ‘the back of the house’ where ø-kpor means ‘back of a
human or animal’.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"88Chapter 4between 1972–74, that is twenty-five years before I collected data in Ayawasi. Although
informants were able to translate it, they identified it as a form that is no longer used.
(150)ait y-ato
3M 3M-hole
‘He is riddled (with bullets).’ (lit. ‘He is holed.’)Other forms with putative person prefixes other than m- appeared unacceptable upon
elicitation, for example *t-asuf, *t-apuo.23
Examples of possessive constructions involving spatial nouns are:
(151)amah m-aom
house 3U-outside
‘outside the house’ (lit. ‘the outside of the house’)(152)aya
m-asuf
water 3U-middle
‘the middle of the water’ (lit. ‘the water’s middle’)(153)ara m-ato
tree 3U-hole
‘inside the tree’ (lit. ‘the tree’s inside’)The uniformity in the first consonant ‘m’ in the spatial nouns can hardly be attributed to
sheer coincidence: it suggests that the spatial nouns are fossilised forms of inalienably
possessed nouns that used to take person prefixes other than m-. Given the uniformity in
form among the spatial nouns, the (archaic) form in (150), and the similarity in behaviour
of all these nouns in possessive constructions, I conclude that spatial nouns are a subclass
of inalienably possessed nouns.
Although the spatial nouns are classified as a subclass of the nouns, their nominal
character can arguably be questioned: as opposed to regular nouns, spatial nouns lack some
typically nominal features. For example, m-ato is the only spatial noun that can function as
the subject of a clause, as in (154), or as the head of an NP (155).
(154)m-ato
m-ae ara
3U-hole 3U-at tree
‘There’s a hole in the wood.’(155)m-ato m-api re-t-o
3U-hole 3U-big location.SPEC-near-U
‘this big hole’23The form suf ‘middle’ is used by members of the Air family, who have their origins in the area to the
north of Ayawasi. Suf is semantically similar to m-asuf ‘middle’, the form used in Ayawasi. Formally,
the ‘northern’ form lacks a putative person prefix m-, and a vowel a. An example is iso suf ‘the middle
of the path’ which is a possessive construction of the type possessor-possessed:
y-amo ø-frok
iso suf
3M-go ø-emerge path middle
‘He emerges at the middle of the path.’Word classes89Another form which may be a spatial noun is mpair ‘place’. Although this form is
unattested in possessive constructions of the type ‘possessor-possessed’, it is formally
similar to the other spatial nouns in that it is m-initial.24 It can occur as the head of an NP:
(156)mpair m-of
place 3U-good
‘The place is good.’While spatial nouns are in some ways formally and syntactically similar to other
inalienably possessed nouns, they also lack some properties that are typically associated
with nouns.
4.3.2 Alienably possessed nouns
Alienably possessed nouns are those forms which cannot take person prefixes. In other
words, unlike the inalienably possessed nouns, the possessor of an alienably possessed
noun is not marked on the noun.
In possessive constructions where the alienably possessed noun is the possessed, the
order of the constituents is possessed-possessor, where the possessor is preceded by the
possessive marker ro. Some examples:
(157)amah ro-Petrus
house POSS-Petrus
‘Petrus’ house’(158)amah ro-t-atia
house POSS-1S-father
‘my father’s house’(159)po-ø-satoh
r-au
NOM-ø-collect POSS-3U
‘her possessions’(160)fane ro-Yan
pig POSS-Yan
‘Yan’s pig’See §5.2 for a more detailed treatment of possessive constructions.
4.3.3 Gender and number in nouns
Maybrat nouns have natural gender: nouns referring to male human or, in some cases,
male animate, are masculine. The other nouns are unmarked. This gender distinction is
only expressed in inalienably possessed nouns in the third person singular. Some examples
of masculine and unmarked subjects appear below, where the subject of the clause is
formally a kinship term as in (161) and (162), a body-part term as in (163) and (164) and
an alienably possessed noun (165) and (166).","[105, 106, 107]"
"The problematic constructions discussed in this section clearly qualify for some of these
criteria, while violating others: all the verbs can occur as single predicates, thus qualifying
for criterion (e). However, they have more than one overtly expressed subject (in the form
of an obligatory person prefix); there may be an ascertainable clause boundary between the
verbs in the form of a pause; there may be an overt conjunction between the verbs; and the
verbs need not always have the same aspect, tense and mood, thus failing criterion (a), (b),
(c) and (d) respectively. The problem is the use of the word ‘may’ in the above: for
instance, a pause ‘may’ be inserted between two verbs in a putative serial verb
construction, rendering it into a coordinating construction. In sequences in which the
second clause clearly functions as a complement without a pause, insertion of a pause
changes the construction into a coordinating one, albeit with a significant change in
meaning. In a putative serial verb construction, does the insertion of a pause also change
the constituency of the construction? Semantically, there is no significant difference in
meaning in constructions with and without a pause, both are coordinating. However, given
the small syntactic deviation from the coordinating ‘norm’, that is violation of the CSC, it
seems that these constructions are at least remotely serial in character, despite the fact that
they fail most of the criteria (see above).
8.8 Conclusions
The most striking syntactic feature of the Maybrat language is that it makes extensive
use of strings of juxtaposed verbs without overt coordinators between them. In this chapter
I have demonstrated that these strings are in fact held together in different ways. At one
end of the continuum, the strings are stitched together quite loosely: these are the
coordinating constructions. At the other end of the continuum there are the ‘tightly
stitched’ constructions, that is those where the verbal form is an adverbial modifier of the
main clause. In between these two poles, there are types of verb sequences that are, to
extend the metaphor, held together by stitches of increasing ‘tightness’, namely
‘problematic’ constructions that stand midway between coordinating constructions and
those where the second clause functions as an object complement; sequences where the
second clause is unambiguously an object complement; and sequences which involve a
prepositional verb. In particular, constructions involving prepositional verbs and
comitative verbs, and to a lesser extent the ‘problematic’ constructions, are strikingly
similar to typical ‘serial’ constructions in serialising languages.",[239]

3M-come 3M-wear NOM-ø-decorate
‘He comes and he wears decorations.’81It is conceivable that -kah ‘wear’ and -kah in the meaning ‘with’ derive from one single
morpheme, given their semantic similarity: a less fluent English translation of (106), for
example, could be ‘He comes and he is with decorations’, but both meanings are closely
related. I therefore assume that there is a link between -kah ‘wear’ and -kah ‘with’. It is not
clear, however, how -kah ‘with’ has come to include a recipient and benefactive function
as well, that is, if we assume that they are one and the same morpheme.
Third, unlike transitive verbs, from which an object can be omitted, prepositional verbs
invariably occur with an object. Omitting this object results in an ungrammatical utterance,
see (107b).

*m-ama m-pat
3U-come 3U-fromThus, prepositional verbs seem to be less ‘verby’ than other transitive verbs. As such,
their verbal status is questionable. The syntactic behaviour of prepositional verbs is
described in detail in §8.4.
4.2.3.6 Comitative
The comitative, marked by the verb -sia, is used to conjoin NPs. Adequate translations
of -sia are ‘and’, ‘with’ or ‘accompanied by’. When -sia takes both a subject and an object,
the resulting constituent can function as an argument in a clause. An example is given in
(108), where tuo t-sia ait functions as the subject of the predicate p-mo.
(108)tuo t-sia
ait p-mo Mosun
1S 1S-with 3M 1P-go.P Mosun
‘I go to Mosun with him.’ (lit. ‘I with him, we go to Mosun.’)(109)t-amo Mosun t-sia
Lys
1S-go Mosun 1S-with Lys
‘I go to Mosun with Lys.’The verb -sia is similar to the verbs expressing oblique notions in two ways: -sia cannot
function as a main verb, and -sia rarely occurs without an object. The morphological and
syntactic properties of -sia are described in detail in §8.5.
4.2.4 Derivation on verbs: -iThe derivational affix -i- ‘TRANS’ changes the valency of verbs from intransitive to
transitive. This affix in turn takes a person prefix that must be coreferent with the subject82Chapter 4of the following verb. Therefore, it is possible that -i- has a verbal origin. The affix -i also
occurs as an independent verb meaning ‘tie’, as in (110), but it seems unlikely that the
form -i- in the sequence -i- + V is semantically related to -i ‘tie’.
(110)ait y-i
fane m-ao
3M 3M-tie pig 3U-leg
‘He ties the pig’s leg.’Derivation with -i- applies to a restricted number of verbs only, and does not seem to be
productive. There are two types of verbs that can undergo derivation with -i-, which are
given below:
To begin, -i- can precede verbs that semantically refer to ‘break’:
(111)-tie
ktus
ftah‘break (sticks)’
‘break (ropes)’
‘break (shells)’Below, in the a-forms the verbs are used intransitively, while in the b-forms they
function as transitive verbs. These verbs must take a derivational affix -i- when functioning
as transitive verbs, as in (114), derived from (112b), which is ungrammatical.

stems in (10)–(12), the person prefix is never phonologically expressed.

‘I deceive’In Maybrat, any form consisting of an overtly prefixed verb can function as a clause,
that is as a constituent consisting minimally of a predicate (the morphological verb) and its
arguments (its person prefix) (see Chapter 6, Introduction, and §6.2). Verbal forms with a
phonologically repressed person prefix can function as a clause just like forms with a
phonologically expressed person prefix. Any form without a phonologically expressed
person prefix can also function as a clause. For the sake of consistence, I assume that those
forms with and those without a phonologically expressed person prefix are structurally
similar. Therefore, I introduce a zero prefix ‘ø-’ to represent the phonologically repressed
person prefix in these forms.
I do realise that the introduction of a ‘zero-morpheme’ may seem redundant, since its
occurrence is restricted to two word classes, namely the class of verbs (§4.2) and the class
of inalienably possessed nouns (§4.3.1). Often, the word class that a form belongs to is
clear from its syntactic behaviour, and, given the morphophonological description here, the
absence of an overt person prefix on these forms can be predicted. However, I have chosen
to mark covert person prefixes throughout this work for two reasons: firstly, and crucially,
there are a number of forms where the presence versus the absence of a person prefix plays
a role: for example, number phrases are headed by a prefixless inalienably possessed
pronoun. Addition of a person prefix could render a different meaning (see §5.1.4). In
adverbial verbs the presence versus the absence of a person prefix is also crucial to the
meaning of an utterance (§8.2). The only way to adequately describe these forms is by
introducing a zero-morpheme, which can, just like overt morphemes, be omitted in the
description where this is required. Secondly, typologically, in many languages the
description of sequences of verbs (or serial verb constructions) hinges on the presence
versus the absence of inflection on the verbs. In my view, the description of sequences of
verbs in Maybrat (Chapter 8) is unambiguous by marking all the inflections, be they overt
or covert. This prevents misinterpretations about the syntactic behaviour of the verbs in
these sequences.
3.1.3 Some exceptions
So far, the analysis of the constraints on the phonological expression of person prefixes
in terms of the CV-syllable structure has been straightforward: forms with monosyllabic
stems, and forms with V-initial stems take overt person prefixes. C-initial forms with
bisyllabic stems take covert person prefixes, unless the second syllable in the stem is Vinitial, or the stem contains a VV-sequence where one V is a (reducible) /i/ or /u/ (see also
§2.6). C-initial stems with two or more syllables take covert person prefixes. There are two
categories of forms, however, that do not seem open to such a straightforward solution. To54Chapter 3begin with, the forms in (14) are bisyllabic, and the second syllable of the stem is V-initial.
By analogy to those forms in (7) and (9) which have /i/ or /u/ in their first syllable, the
forms in (14) would be expected to receive an overt person prefix. However, prefixed
forms are rejected, as indicated in the last column in the examples below:
(14)/kiam/
/fia/
/yuo/[»kijAm]
[»fija]
[»juwo]CV|VC
CV|V
CV|V‘I am ill’
‘I swallow’
‘I flee’*[m-»kijAm]
*[m-»fija]
*[m-»juwo]It seems to be the case that CV-structure alone cannot account for all the forms, and that
in some cases stress also plays a role. Recall, that in Maybrat, stress is lightly phonemic. In
many cases it can be predicted, but in the forms in (14), stress falls on the first syllable, and
/i/ or /u/ in this syllable cannot be reduced. The resulting verb has two syllables, and will
not allow a person prefix because this would add an extra syllable to the form, resulting in
an illicit tri-syllabic form.2
A second group of forms that do not tally with the observation that monosyllabic stems
can take an overt person prefix is given in (15). These forms, despite the fact that they
constitute monosyllabic stems, never take overt person prefixes. I propose that these forms
are marked lexically as exceptions to the rule of person prefixing.3
23An alternative solution is as follows: if on a morphophonological level it is assumed that the glides [y]
and [w] between the vowels in (14) are not epenthetic, but phonologically present, i.e. /y/ and /w/, then
the stems of the forms in (14) can be represented as in (a) below. This yields forms in which the second
syllable of the stem is C-initial, i.e. forms that are analogous to those in (10), (11) and (12):
(a) /kiyam/
[»kijAm]
CV|CVC
‘I am ill’
/fiya/
[»fija]
CV|CV
‘I swallow’
/yuwo/
[»juwo]
CV|CV
‘I flee’
The difference in morphological behaviour between all these forms could then be explained in terms
of CV-structure, just like the other forms. However, there are no minimal pairs to warrant a distinction
between the presence versus the absence of the glides /y/ and /w/ in this position. As such, the distinction
would have to be described on a morphophonological level.
Obviously this morphophonological criterion does not work for forms that never take a person
prefix. For example, nouns that have a /VyV/ sequence or a /VwV/ sequences may be transcribed
morphophonologically as either :VyV: / :VwV: or as :VV:, as illustrated in (b):
(b) [»tijEf]
:tief:

:tuox:

‘place’
[»kuwo]
:kuo:
:kuwo:
‘sago-powder’
There is one way to explain the odd behaviour of the forms in (15), namely that they are a relic of what
was once a distinction in length. Throughout the collection of data, informants kept insisting on audible
differences between certain homophones, for instance between the forms given in Chapter 2, footnote 20
([»nasçm] ‘You carry, your name is’; [»maru] ‘She cuts, lake’; [»ana] ‘they, fence’ and [»moo] ‘She takes,
She itches’; and [m´»tAx] ‘dog, It is bitter’ etc.). The strategies to find this difference were as follows: (1)
Recordings were made of the words both in isolation and in context. In these recordings no differences
were found after thorough analysis with the speech program GIPOS (Graphical Interactive Processing of
Speech, see also Chapter 2, footnote 34); (2) The recordings mentioned in (1) were manipulated,
whereby: (a) the vowels in the forms were lengthened/shortened, and the pitch at which they were uttered
was changed; and (b) putative minimal forms uttered in a context were interchanged. The results of these
manipulations were offered to informants, but no clear indications for the existence for minimal pairs wasMorphophonology

The formation of question words suggests the presence of a morphophonological glide
between two vowels. Question words are formed by adding an interrogative particle -yo or
-ye to a demonstrative base.4 Some examples (forms between ‘: :’ are morphophonological
representations):
(16)/to-yo/
/wo-yo/:to-yo:
:wo-yo:‘where’ (SPEC)
‘where’ (GEN)Two other forms, including the morphophonological representations, appear below:
(17)/fi-ye/
/mi-yo/:fi-ye:
:mi-yo:‘how’
‘where’ (ADV)Theoretically, the morphophonological forms in (17) could be *:fie: and *:mio:, as these
could underlie the same phonetic forms as those given above, that is [»fije] and [»mijo]
respectively. However, it is clear from the forms in (16) that the interrogative suffix is
:y:-initial. By analogy, I conclude that the suffixes in the forms in (17) are also :y:-initial,
in other words, that the glide in these forms is morphophonologically present.
3.3 /a/-initial stems
Maybrat verbs and inalienably possessed nouns (including kinship terms) of which the
stem begins with /a/, lack this /a/ in the first and second person plural forms (but not in the
third person unmarked). In other words, there is an alternation between first and second
person plural stems and the rest. If the first and second person plural stems are
C-initial, the CC-sequence resulting after prefixation with a phonologically expressed
person prefix is broken up by an epenthetic schwa.","[70, 71, 72, 73]"

The head of a clause can be an intransitive verb (see §4.2.2) or a transitive verb (§4.2.3).
In sentences (6)–(8) examples of the ‘minimal’ clauses are given, that is clauses consisting
only of a verb and its obligatory person prefix. In these examples, arguments other than
person prefixes are not expressed.

‘I am big.’(7)y-fos

‘The man Hermanus is already old.’(10)ara m-ake
re-t-o

tree 3U-fruit location.SPEC-near-U 3U-red
‘The fruit (of the tree) is red.’In sentences (11)–(14) examples of clauses involving transitive verbs are given. As
argued in §4.2.3, six different types of transitive verb can be identified in Maybrat, namely
‘regular transitive verbs’, that is verbs which take a nominal object (§4.2.3.1); ‘motion
verbs’ and ‘position verbs’ (§4.2.3.2); ‘shared argument construction verbs’ (§4.2.3.3);
‘complement-taking verbs’ (§4.2.3.4); prepositional verbs (§4.2.3.5), and a comitative verb
(§4.2.3.6). With the exception of the prepositional verbs and the comitative verb, all the
verbs in these classes can function as the head of a clause. The discussion in this chapter
will be centred around clauses that include these transitive verbs; prepositional verbs and
the comitative verb are treated in Chapter 8.
Below, examples of clauses involving transitive verbs are given.

In addition to a subject, expressed by an overt or covert person prefix, that is always
present in a clause because it is included in the verbal form, a subject may be expressed in
the form of an NP. The motivation for expressing such a subject is pragmatic: if the subject
cannot be unambiguously identified from the preceding discourse, then it is expressed. The
absence of an overt subject NP never renders a clause ungrammatical.
Examples where the subject NP is omitted are given in sentences (16) and (17).
Examples (15)–(17) form the beginning of a story (‘Ø’ marks the position where an overt
subject NP is absent):
(15)pi

‘He lives at Mosun Mapat.’In example (15), which is an instance of a verbless clause (see §6.5) the topic of the
discourse, pi s-ait ‘one man’ is introduced. In the following sentence, pi s-ait is not
explicitly mentioned, as it is clear from both the discourse and the third person masculine
person prefix on the verb -hu that pi s-ait is still the subject. The same applies to (17). In
both sentences the subject is ‘notionally’ present.
The relation between the overt subject NP and the clause itself, in which the subject NP
specifies information which is already present in the person prefix on the verb, but has no
syntactic function, is described as an appositional relation, following Dik (1987:134–135).
The appositional character of subject NPs in Maybrat can be syntactically motivated:
temporal adverbials (see §6.8.1) can either precede or follow the subject NP without
creating any difference in meaning:
(18) a.is
ana m-kai
mes
yesterday 3P 3U-meet fern.vegetable
‘Yesterday they found fern vegetables.’b.ana is
m-kai mes
3P yesterday 3U-find fern.vegetable
‘Yesterday they found fern vegetables.’2In the system of exchanging ceremonial cloth, people often lend their cloths to other parties, who may use
them in trade again. At some point, such cloths, or cloths equivalent in value to the ones originally lent
out, are claimed back by the owners. In the story, Srah Wata sets out to reclaim his ceremonial cloths.","[161, 162, 163]"
"4found; (3) Perception experiments were performed, in which one informant was asked to utter relevant
(i.e. members of the putative minimal forms) and irrelevant forms in random order in isolation, and
another informant was asked to translate these forms into Indonesian. It was found that informants could
not differentiate between putative minimal pairs. Based on the results of (1), (2) and (3) I conclude that
there is no difference, but given the speakers’ insistence, there may once have been a difference in, for
instance, length, that has disappeared, but which has persisted in the morphophonology of verbs. If this is
the case, the forms considered in (15) may have had phonologically ‘long’ vowels, which, like bisyllabic
stems, disqualified them for overt prefixation.

‘Don’t marry a woman from there.’The head of an RC may be omitted. Omission of a head may occur if a referent has
already been introduced in the discourse. In examples (71) and (72), the head of the first

(73)fane re-t-o,
ro m-api, m-ait ora
pig location.SPEC-near-U REL 3U-big 3U-eat garden
‘This pig, the big one, it ate from the garden.’5.4 The element ro
So far, the element ro has been described in two syntactic functions, namely as a
possessive marker and as a marker of the restricting clause in RCs. An example of each
appears below:
(74)amah ro-tuo
house POSS-1S
‘my house’(75)aof ro ana m-fat
sago REL 3P 3U-fell
‘The sago tree that they felled.’Possessive constructions and RC-constructions are syntactically and semantically very
similar. Syntactically, they all have a nominal head followed by a modifier marked by ro.
In both types of construction, the entire constituent is an NP because it can function as a
subject or object in a clause. Semantically, in each construction, [ro + constituent]
functions as a modifier to the nominal head. The exact function of this modifier is to
narrow down the potential referents expressed by the head. For example, in (74) the
referent of the generic term ‘house’ is narrowed down to one item, namely ‘the house that
is mine’. Likewise, in (75), the referent of the generic term ‘sago tree’ is narrowed down toNoun phrases139the item ‘the sago tree that they felled’. In general terms, ro marks the following
constituent as a ‘specifier’. Thus, ro ‘POSS’ and ro ‘REL’ are arguably related.
The marker ro is, in turn, possibly related to the demonstrative prefix re‘location.SPEC’. In §4.4.1, I illustrated that re- occurs in demonstratives that function
attributively, and that it is used if the head noun is specific, that is if the head noun can be
pinpointed. An example follows:
(76)amah re-f-o
house location.SPEC-very.near-U
‘this house’If example (76) is compared to (74) and (75) above, it is not difficult to see a possible
relation: syntactically, re- ‘location.SPEC’ and ro ‘POSS’/‘REL’ are restricted to the
environment of NPs. All follow a nominal head in an NP. Pragmatically, all mark the
following constituent, whether this is an NP, an RC or a demonstrative form, as a modifier
of the head. In many languages, relative clause markers derive from demonstratives,
interrogatives, or relative pronouns. This is in accordance with their function, namely to
specify or determine the referent of the noun (Hopper & Traugott 1993:195–196).
Himmelmann (1996) argues that demonstratives and RC-markers are often related. He
argues that the common function of both is their recognitional use: they make referents
more accessible in discourse (Himmelmann 1996:230). In Maybrat, not ‘accessibility’ but
rather ‘specificity’ is the common functional denominator.
5.5 Other phrasal modifiers
In §4.7.2, I introduced two manner adverbs, ati ‘really’ and tu ‘indeed, really, truly’ that
can modify an NP. These seem to be the only adverbs that modify a constituent that
functions as an NP. In the examples below, sasu ati and rae tu function as an object NP in
a clause.
(77)ait y-ait

ati11
3M 3M-eat sweet.potato really
‘He is eating a sweet potato.’(78)m-ape
rae
tu
3U-give.birth person really
‘She gives birth to a real man.’Sentences (79) and (80) contain examples of the idiomatic expression po sai ‘It’s
nothing, really.’ Formally, sai is an aspect adverb (see §4.7.3).

po

2-afraid PROHIB thing just
‘Don’t be afraid, it’s nothing, really.’(80)t-awe po

‘I thought12 nothing of it, really.’11Sasu ati, literally ‘real sweet potato’ is used in contrast with ara sasu ‘cassava’, which was introduced as a
new crop in the Bird’s Head. Like sweet potato, cassava is a tuber, but its skin looks like wood, hence the
term ara ‘tree’ in its name.","[155, 156, 157]"

‘How many banknotes should I give?’The interrogative ro-yo ‘which one’ (REL-INT) follows the head noun about which more
information is requested. This follows the regular pattern of RCs, in which the head noun
is followed by the RC marker ro and the relativised clause (see §5.3). Some examples are:

The temporal question word titiya ‘when’ invariably occurs in clause-initial position,
which is where the temporal periphery is normally located (see §6.8.1). Examples
involving titiya are given below. In (36) the comma indicates the beginning of a new
clause. In (37), the object po-kuo r-anu re-f-o has been fronted (see §6.4 on objects).

predicate.
7.1.3.3 Location
The location question words to-yo ‘where’ (area.N-INT), wo-yo ‘where’ (area.GEN-INT)
and mi-yo ‘where’ (PRESTT-INT) occur in clause-final position, like the location periphery.
Some examples involving to-yo are given in (38)–(40). Recall that the location marker tois used to refer to a specific area, that is one that can be pinpointed, as opposed to wo-,
which refers to a more general area. The form mi- is used for presentative forms. The
reader is referred to §4.5 for a more detailed discussion of the differences in meaning
between these three interrogative forms.

Like manner adverbials, the manner interrogative fi-ye occupies the clause-final
position:10
8This sentence is taken out of a text which gives a description of what will happen to the land if the secret
of Wuon, i.e. the initiation ritual for men, is discovered by outsiders.
9
This is possibly a compound form, including -oa ‘not know’. Compare srohni ‘forget’, in which sroh is
‘forget’. Both forms include ni as a final element. The element ha in -oa hani is unattested in the data.
10
The example below is taken from a letter written to me when I was in Ayawasi. The sentence may be a
direct translation from Indonesian, which would account for the fact that fi-ye occurs in clause-initial
position: the corresponding Indonesian bagaimana ‘how’ would also occupy the clause-initial position.

‘And in the end how will it be, in the end how will it be?’The word wo-yo, which usually functions as a location question word, can also function
as a manner question word, in which case it is translated as ‘how’:11
(51)m-orie12 t-no wo-yo
3U-now 1S-do LOC.GEN-INT
‘How shall I do it?’7.2 Imperative
The function of the imperative is to give commands or instructions. There are two ways
of forming the imperative. The first type of imperative is marked phonologically: the
speaker used a loud voice in order to give emphasis to the utterance. There are no syntactic
markers. Some examples:
(52)n-ait
2-eat
‘Eat!’(53)n-iit
2-eat.P
‘Eat (plural)!’(54)n-ama amah
2-come house
‘Come to the house!’(55)n-ama ø-srot
2-come ø-quickly
‘Come quickly!’The second type of imperative is characterised by the presence of the focus adverb re in
clause-final position. Imperatives formed with re are milder than the intonationally marked
imperatives discussed above. The difference between the two types of imperative is
illustrated in examples (56) and (52):11This was the only example wo-yo ‘how’: it may be an exception to the rule, although the example was
checked with different people, and invariably translated as indicated.
12
The form m-orie is attested in the data a few times. I assume that it is a predicative form of the temporal
adverb orie ‘later’. Thus, m-orie constitutes a clause, in which m- functions as a person prefix.","[199, 200, 201, 202]"
"204Chapter 8As mentioned before, these constructions are formally the same as indirect speech
constructions: both -awe and the following verb receive a person prefix, which is apparent
from all the examples so far in this section, and the entire utterance is dominated by one
intonation contour (83):
(83)t-awe y-amo y-aut
tuò
/
1S-say 3M-go 3M-climb palm.wine.tree
‘I think he goes and climbs into the palm-wine tree.’Moreover, in the interrogative mood, the scope of the interrogator is always the entire
utterance (84) and (85):
(84)n-awe y-kom
am m-kah y-atia
y-sia
y-me
a
2-say 3M-write letter 3U-for 3M-father 3M-with 3M-mother INT
‘Do you think he writes a letter to his father and mother?’(85)n-awe y-no po ø-sre
p-awiya
rae
m-atak
ait a
2-say 3M-do thing ø-wrong thing-who person 3U-angry 3M INT
‘Do you think he’s done something wrong which is why people are angry
with him?’Thus, indirect speech and pseudo-quotative constructions are formally the same, but
differ in semantic content.
8.4 Prepositional notions
In §4.2.3.5, I introduced four prepositional verbs, listed again below:
(86)-ae
-kit
-pat
-kah‘at’
‘towards’
‘from’
‘with’/‘to’/‘for’I illustrated that only -ae ‘at’ can function as a main verb and that it may have a
defective paradigm; and that -kah invariably has a defective paradigm, and that these verbs
invariably occur with an object. I concluded that these verbs are less ‘verby’ than verbs
that can function as main verbs.
In sequences of verbs, prepositional verbs are never the first verb in the sequence. Verb
sequences that involve these verbs are different from any of the other sequences discussed
so far. To begin with, all sequences allow a pause preceding the prepositional verb, but
rather than changing the meaning of the utterance, this merely shifts the emphasis of the
utterance to the prepositional verb and its object. For example, in (87b), the fact that people
go towards the sago tree (and not somewhere else) is emphasised. There is a rise in pitch
directly preceding the pause, but when the second verb is -ae, a fall in pitch is allowed, as
in (90c). This is because the verb -ae can function as a single-verb clause.

‘I went, and (now) I’m at the house.’c.t-amò / t-ae amàh /
1S-go
1S-at house
‘I went, and (now) I’m at the house.’With the exception of sequences involving -ae, none of the sequences with prepositional
verbs allow insertion of the coordinator mati. If mati is inserted between -ae and a
preceding verb, this incurs a considerable change in meaning, as illustrated in (91b). In this
example, y-ae functions as a main verb. This shows that -ae still has many verbal
properties.
(91) a.b.ait ø-frok

mati
y-ae aof m-air
3M ø-emerge and.then 3M-at sago 3U-foot.of.tree
‘He arrived and then he was at the foot of the sago tree.’The examples above illustrate clearly that the sequences involving -ae behave like
coordinating constructions, while sequences with other prepositional verbs do not.
Taking the objects out of coordinating constructions, adverbial constructions and
constructions involving an object complement seems straightforward, being either possible
or impossible according to informants. However, taking the objects out of sequences
involving a prepositional verb is less straightforward: the objects of -kit, as in example
(92b), and -pat, as in example (93b), can be extracted without any problem:206Chapter 8(92) a.b.(93) a.b.rae

in example (94a). A similar type of construction with -kit is not possible.
(94)ait y-pat
rapuoh y-ama
3M 3M-from forest 3M-come
‘He comes from the forest.’The behaviour (94) differs from constructions where the prepositional verb is preceded
by the motion verb. The differences are as follows: first, the entire utterance must be
dominated by one intonation contour. The presence of two intonation contours renders the
utterance ungrammatical, as shown in (95).
(95)*ait y-pat
rapuóh / y-àma
3M 3M-from forest
3M-comeThe second, most notable, difference with constructions where -pat precedes the motion
verb is in its behaviour under relativisation. Whereas relativisation on the object of -kit, as
in (92b) results in a grammatical construction, relativisation on the object of -pat results in
an anomalous construction, for example (96). I construed it myself, and some speakers
accepted it, but others quite resolutely rejected this sentence as unacceptable. In
spontaneous speech, this kind of construction is unattested.

REL 3M-from 3M-come 3U-stay far

‘The forest from where he comes is far (away).’Unlike the objects of the verbs -pat and -kit, extracting the object of the verb m-kah in
the same manner is not allowed, as illustrated below:
(97)*pam ro t-fat
ara m-kah m-api
axe REL 1S-fell tree 3U-with 3U-bigHowever, there is a way to relativise on the object of -kah. If in the relativised sentence
the order of the verbs is reversed so that the first verb is m-kah, and what was originally the
first verb follows m-kah, the resulting utterance is grammatical. This is illustrated in
examples (98)–(99), where -kah semantically expresses an instrumental, and in (100),
where it expresses a recipient/benefactive:Sequences of verbs

Movement processes such as relativisation can be used to establish the syntactic
behaviour of different types of constructions. In §5.3, I illustrated that in sentences
consisting of a single-verb clause, there are two syntactic positions that can be relativised
on, namely the subject and the object. In the present section I will discuss the behaviour of
coordinating sequences of verbs under relativisation.
When the objects of (16) and (14) are extracted, the results are anomalous.

*‘The biscuit that the boy cries and someone gives is small.’Semantically, in example (23), the head noun of the RC, naf, is understood to be the
‘topic’ of kmuk awiah. The same is true for biskui in (24). This gives rise to a ‘logical
conflict’ in the sentence. A ‘logical conflict’ is a situation where the speaker’s empathy, or
identification, with the events described in the sentence is disturbed (cf. Kuno & Kaburaki
1977:628, 645).
This semantic explanation can also be formulated as a syntactic one, namely that it is
not possible to extract objects out of a coordinating structure. This generalisation was
coined by Ross (1967), and is called the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC). Given that
these constructions are coordinating, I assume on the basis of the examples above, that
Ross’ CSC is valid for Maybrat, and can be used as a criterion for distinguishing
coordinating constructions from non-coordinating ones.
8.2 Adverbial verbs
Apart from coordinating constructions of verbs, another type of verb sequence can be
identified, which I will refer to as adverbial verbs, following their semantic characteristics,
namely to modify or specify an event expressed by a verb (see §4.7). There are two types
of adverbial verbs: the first type occurs as a bare-stem verb when it follows a verb that it
modifies. Constructions involving this type of verb are very rare indeed in Maybrat: their
occurrence in the data is limited to the examples presented in this section.6 The second type
is the verb -o ‘take’, which expresses modality when it occurs as the first verb in a
sequence.
6Of course the criterion of omission of a prefix on a second verb is not valid for hypothetical cases where a
covert person prefix occurs. In other words, adverbial verbs that have a bisyllabic stem may exist.
However, no semantic, phonological or syntactic evidence has been found to prove the existence of these
forms.","[209, 210]"
"Simon y-amo Kumurkek iye fe
Simon 3M-go Kumurkek also NEG
‘He does not also go to Kumurkek.’The order iye fe, as in example (185b), is highly marked; the most frequent order for the
negator fe and the adverbial iye is that in (185a). This is surprising, since usually the
negator occurs clause-finally. This suggests that the combination fe iye is idiomatic. Some
more examples are:
(186)m-amo ninan

‘They also do not go randomly.’(187)n-he fe
iye
2-see NEG also
‘You also don’t see.’The clause173The negator fe can also be followed by the aspect adverbial fares ‘still’ to form the
idiomatic expression fe fares ‘not yet’.31 Some examples follow:
(188)n-ao

Nella 3U-go NEG still
‘Nella has not gone yet.’(190)m-e
pitis

3U-give money NEG still
‘She has not given money yet.’When there are other adverbials in the clause, that is kaket in (191), fe fares normally
follows those adverbs:

kaket fe
fares
ø-ill
3U-empty well NEG still
‘My illness is not yet finished well.’ (lit. ‘I am ill, it is not yet finished well.’)In sentence-initial position, the predicative m-fe can be followed by the manner adverb
fi-t-o to form the expression m-fe fi-t-o. This expression stipulates that there is a choice: if
the clause preceding m-fe fi-t-o does not apply, then the following clause applies. M-fe
fi-t-o can be adequately translated as ‘or alternatively’. Some examples follow:
(192)y-fais m-ae pron, m-fe

in §9.1.3. Disjunctive coordination is also used in alternative questions, which are
discussed in §7.1.

"168Chapter 6In principle, these sentences are open to a third interpretation, namely one where the
subject is negated. This interpretation is extremely marked: if it is intended, the subject is
emphasised, and there may be a small pause following the subject.
(163)Potafit / ait y-apo
fe
Potafit
3M 3M-eat.meat NEG
‘It’s Potafit (and not someone else) who does not eat.’In discourse, these potential ambiguities given above normally do not arise. The reason
for this is that the interpretation of negated sentences normally depends on the context in
which they are used (cf. Payne 1985:198). In other words, as long as the context is known,
the interpretation of the negated sentence (that is the scope of the negator in that particular
case) is usually self-evident. For example, in (164) fe negates the clause m-he (ait), where
ait is the object that has been omitted in the sentence because it is already known from the
previous sentence. It is clear that the interpretation of m-he fe should be ‘They don’t see
him’, (that is the scope of the negation is the object of the clause, since the previous
sentence indicates that a group of people is looking for ‘him’). This interpretation is
confirmed in the following sentence m-awe y-e y-amo.
(164)m-awe y-ama
ø-ste iso. M-he fe.
M-awe y-e
y-amo
3U-say 3M-come ø-wait road 3U-see NEG 3U-say 3M-return 3M-go
‘They think he has come and is waiting on the road. They do not see him.
They think he has gone back.’The negator fe can also be used to create a statement which is semantically strongly
positive. Phonologically, these instances are pronounced at a high pitch, and usually with a
loud voice. Semantically, (165), for example, negates the fact that there is a little, thus
emphasises that there is a lot.24 An example:
(165)sa m-siar
rere
fe
fish 3U-many scrupulously NEG
‘An awful lot of fish.’ (lit. ‘It’s not a “regular” amount of fish.’)6.9.2 Predicative use
The negator fe can also function as a verb, in which case it takes a third person
unmarked person prefix. This form, m-fe, can be adequately translated as ‘it is not’. Some
examples follow:
(166)24arko
m-fe,
y-o
ita m-ata25
firewood 3U-NEG 3M-take leaf leaf
‘There is no firewood, he takes leafs.’Semantically similar constructions also appear in other languages, such as Du. Niet te weinig, lit. ‘not too
sparingly’, but actually meaning ‘an awful lot’.
25
The term ita m-ata possibly refers to ‘foliage’.","[185, 186]"
"Sequences of verbs191coordinating: for instance, a sequence of verbs which was not coordinating to begin with
could be made into a coordinating construction by inserting mati. What makes this test
relevant for coordinating sequences is the semantic similarity of coordinating sequences
with and without mati: in other types of sequences, for instance ‘cognition verb + V’
sequences, it will appear that mati can effectuate a change in meaning.
8.1.3.2 Scope of interrogative
Foley and van Valin (1984:208) use, among other criteria, the scope of what they term
‘operators’ (categories of verb inflection, tense, mood etc.) over junctures in order to
determine the particular type of juncture. Negation as a test is often used in the literature
(for example Foley & Olson 1985:27), but I have omitted it here.4 The reason for this is
that despite the fact that the types of verb sequences are different, they all behave similarly
when negated.
In coordinating sequences of verbs, that is those where each verb constitutes a separate
clause, it is expected that each conjunct can independently take peripheral operators. That
is, the scope of these operators can be over just one conjunct (Foley & van Valin
1984:244). This is confirmed in examples (19)–(21) below. Each example is ambiguous:
the scope of the interrogative can be either over the entire construction (reading 1.) or over
the final verb (reading 2.). In each case, reading 1. is the preferred interpretation. Note that
the scope of the interrogator can never exclude the final conjunct in the series. So, in (21),
the interrogation can never have as its scope m-ko tafoh; saruk po-iit; or m-ko tafoh saruk
po-iit alone.5

2. ‘She burns a fire and cooks food but does she scoop water?’Unlike in the indicative mood, intonation can be distinctive in coordinating sequences in
the interrogative mood. Compare example (22) below with (19). In (22), a pause separates
the two conjuncts, and there is a drop in pitch at the end of each conjunct. Unlike (19), (22)
cannot be ambiguous, as the scope of the interrogator can only be over the last conjunct.","[208, 209]"

‘The sun and the moon emerge.’The omission of a subject-prefix results in a ‘decategorialised’ form, that is a form in
which aspects typical of that category, such as the presence of a person prefix for verbs, are
absent (cf. Hopper 1991:22). This feature, or rather the lack of this feature, may be
indicative of a grammaticalisation process in which the comitative verb is changing into a
preposition. Other motivations for a change in categorial status are the differing syntactic
properties of -sia compared to those of ‘true’ verbs. Shifts in the grammatical status of a
lexical item to assume a more grammatical function (here that of a coordinator) are often
accompanied by restricted morphological and syntactic properties (Heine et al. 1991:2,
they refer to Hopper and Thompson 1984).
The verb -sia also occurs in clause-final position. Its meaning here is not fully
understood. In examples (114) and (115) below, the verb -sia refers to the fact that a dog
accompanies the subject. Syntactically, the objects of the verbs, that is mtah sumaya r-ana
s-au in (114) and mtah in (115) are topicalised (see §6.6 on topicalisation). In these
examples, -sia semantically implies ‘be accompanied for hunting’. In (115b) mtah occurs
in clause-final position, but here the meaning of ‘accompany for hunting’ is absent.

always expressed, albeit as a topicalised form. The example in (116) is taken from a text

4.7 Adverbs
An adverb is a word that modifies or specifies an event expressed by a predicate. The
class of adverbs constitutes a closed class of words, most of which are morphologically
simple. A distinction based on semantic and syntactic criteria can be made between a
number of different types of adverbs, namely temporal adverbs, manner adverbs, aspect
adverbs, location adverbs, negators and focus adverbs. None of the lists of adverbs
presented below are intended to be exhaustive.
4.7.1 Temporal adverbs
Temporal adverbs place an event that is described in the clause in time. These adverbs
occur in clause-initial position. The following temporal adverbs can be identified:
(273)is
orie
men
ftiah
ira
iwai(n)
rere
tian
mti
tna
pose‘yesterday’
‘today, now’
‘later, tomorrow’
‘the day after tomorrow’
‘just now, previously’
‘just now’
‘later’
‘formerly, in the past’
‘night’
‘recently’
‘a long time ago’Some examples follow:112Chapter 4(274)men

‘Formerly people stabbed (=killed) the woman Ais, and they submerged her

from tuf ‘three’ upwards can function as time adverbials, as in examples (276) and (277).
(276)tuf

three bird 3U-big 3U-come
‘In three days the big aeroplane will come.’(277)mat p-ehoh fane
five 1P-stab pig
‘In five days we will stab (=kill) the pig.’The marker ti ‘PAST’ can precede a numeral that functions as a temporal adverbial to
refer to a specific time span in the past, compare examples (276) and (278):57
(278)tituf ru m-api m-ama
PAST three bird 3U-big 3U-come
‘Three days ago the big aeroplane came.’The syntactic behaviour of temporal adverbials in the clause is discussed in more detail
in §6.8.1.
4.7.2 Manner adverbs
Manner adverbs say something about the way in which an event takes place. Most
manner adverbs can only modify a predicate, while others can modify an NP as well.
Therefore, a subdivision into two groups based on syntactic criteria seems warranted: the
first group constitutes manner adverbs that can only modify a predicate. Some examples
follow:57Ti- ‘side.N’ (see §4.4.) and ti ‘PAST’ are homophones which are possibly related, as in many languages
temporal decitic forms are derived from demonstrative forms (see also §6.8.1).
The element t-i in a. below is unrelated to either ti- ‘side.N’ or ti ‘PAST’. Rather, it is a contracted form
of t-imara ‘my ear’. Compare b., in which the subject is 3M. The expression -imara m-tuk ‘ears are
closed’ is common to refer to small children who do not yet understand fully what goes on in the adult
world.
a. tuo tian

‘many times’ (connotation: until bored)
‘reject’In a clause, these adverbs occur following the verb, but they do not necessarily occur in
clause-final position, as indicated in example (281). Some examples in a clause are:
(280)Petrus y-mat

ninan
to tauf
3U-sibling.SS REL 3U-old just.now 3U-stay at.random LOC forest
‘Her older sister (mentioned) just now lives wherever (suits her best) in the
forest.’The form war ‘reject’ would semantically also qualify as a verb: however, it never
occurs with a subject prefix. Like other manner adverbs, it occurs in clause-final position,
and it says something about the way in which an event (in (282) about ‘how’ something is
put (away)) takes place. I therefore analyse it as a manner adverb.
(282)p-se
war
1p-place reject
‘We rejected it.’Two other manner adverbs are ati ‘really’ and tu ‘indeed, really, truly’. They can
modify a clause, as in (283), or a NP, as in (284). The semantic difference between these
two adverbs is not clear. They always occur in constituent-final position.

‘He is a human.’ (lit. ‘He is a real man.’)The syntactic behaviour of manner adverbs in clauses is described in §6.8.2.
4.7.3 Aspect adverbs
Aspect refers to the internal temporal structure of an event (Foley 1986:143). In
Maybrat, aspect is expressed through adverbs. Examples of aspect adverbs are:58This form fits the structural and semantic pattern of reduplicated forms (see §3.5). However, the form nin,
which is the hypothetical stem of such a form, is unattested in the data.","[128, 129, 130, 131]"
"132Chapter 5Given this, an NP in which a sequence [Classifier Numeral] modifies a head noun, as in
example (31), formally contains an NP within an NP. This illustrates the recursivity of
NPs.5 In a construction like (31), however, the sequence [Classifier Numeral] cannot be
further modified by a demonstrative. In other words, the NP within the NP is restricted
with respect to its expansive capacities.

‘these four big men’5.1.4 Numerals
In §4.6 the numerals from ‘one’ through to ‘twenty’ were presented. I illustrated that the
terms for ‘one’ to ‘four’ (and in some dialects ‘five’) are unique number terms, and that the
higher numbers are referred to by using terms for hands/fingers and feet/toes until ‘one
man gone’ representing ‘twenty’ is reached. These higher numbers (with the exception of
s-t-atem ‘ten’6) structurally resemble NPs in themselves: they can be headed by the noun
tem (derived from the stem -atem) ‘hand’; krem ‘finger/toe’; or oo ‘foot.PL’, all of which
are stripped of a person prefix,7 and modified by one of the unique number terms. I will
refer to these structures as ‘number phrases’. Some examples follow:
(32)tem s-au
hand one-3U
‘five’ (lit. ‘one hand’)(33)krem
tuf
finger/toe three
‘eight’ (lit. ‘three fingers’)For the higher numbers, two juxtaposed number phrases are used.

‘nineteen’ (lit. ‘one foot, four toes’)5
6
7Matthews (1981:77) indicates that NPs are often a recursive category.
S-t-atem ‘ten’ consists of a prefix s- ‘one’ and an inalienably possessed noun t-atem ‘my hand’ (see §4.6).
Tem ‘hand’ and oo ‘foot.PL’ may, and usually do, take a person prefix because they consist of only one
syllable. However, these person prefixes are not present. By analogy I assume that krem ‘finger/toe’,
which normally takes a covert person prefix, is also stripped of its prefix here. The presence versus the
absence of this prefix can result in a difference in meaning, hence the prefix is distinctive:
a. y-ait
oo
ewok
b. y-ait
n-oo
ewok
3M-eat foot.PL two
3M-eat 1-foot.PL two
‘He eats twelve (of them).’
‘He eats your two feet.’Noun phrases133This whole number phrase or sequence of number phrases can function as a modifier to
a head noun in an NP. Like example (31), (36) illustrates the recursive properties of NPs:
oo and krem s-au function as one number phrase, constituting two juxtaposed number
phrases. This number phrase functions as a numeral in the NP m-ana oo krem s-au. This
NP, in turn, functions as a modifier to the head noun ku in the NP ku m-ana oo krem s-au
re-t-o, which functions as a subject in the clause given in (36):

5.1.5 Quantifying verbs
Quantifying verbs, introduced in §4.2.2.3, follow a head noun and a verbal modifier,
and precede the determiner in an NP. They are unattested in NPs which also contain a
numeral or number phrase. The example below is elicited: quantifying verbs do not
normally appear in large NPs like this.
(37)rae
m-anes ø-wisau re-t-o

‘all these old people’Unlike adjectival verbs, quantifying verbs can be used as substantives. In examples (38)
and (39) a quantifier occupies the subject position in the clause, and in (40) and (41) the
object position. Quantifying verbs that take the place of an NP cannot be further modified.

‘Give just a little.’(41)m-kah ø-pria
3U-burn ø-everything

While NPs with a noun-head in subject or object position can be extracted through
relativisation,8 as illustrated in example (42), this is not the case for quantifiers that occupy
these positions, cf. (43) and (44).","[149, 150, 151]"
