"Argument order in transitive clausesAll overtly realized arguments are either free pronouns or full noun phrases.
Rarely, both subject and object are overtly realized as free pronouns. In such
cases, the subject always precedes the object. This is independent of whether
the object is indexed on the verb with prefix (89) or a suffix (90):
(89)(90)n

If the arguments are instantiated by full noun phrases instead of pronouns, the
unmarked constituent order is AOV. Overt subject noun phrases usually
precede object noun phrases. This order is very consistently observed in
elicited examples, e.g.:
(91)naka=e
unáng=o
man=SG.M woman=SG.F
‘The man saw the woman.’wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECLIn natural discourse, however, relative order of subject and object noun
phrases is less consistently A followed by O. This usually does not create
ambiguities due to the language’s head-marking characteristics, which in most
cases allow the identification of syntactic relations through information from
the pronominal and classificatory affixes without having to take constituent
order information into account. Deviation from the unmarked order in natural
discourse will be discussed in 9.10.1 below.
Although unmarked constituent order in Mian is AOV, verb-final position
is really all that is mandated. Hence, it is possible to invert subject and object
if both grammatical relations are realized by overt noun phrases.
In many cases, argument indexing disambiguates as in example (92) where
the pronominal affixes -e and wa- clearly indicate that the man is the ‘seer’
and the woman the ‘seen’:
(92)unáng=o
naka=e
wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
woman=SG.F man=SG.M 3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘The man has seen the woman.’A natural example is (93) where argument indexing on the verb indicates who
leads whom. Preposed objects are typically topics and marked with the topic
clitic =le:

PL.AN.O-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED‘As for the children, Sobining took them and then ...’ [Sobining]3649. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseI analyse examples like (93) as topicalizations rather than cleft structures
because there are no cues that suggest the latter analysis, such as presence of a
copula or an obvious bi-clausal structure.
Argument inversion is not possible with pronominal subjects without topic
marking of the object. Compare (94) and (95):
(94)imen =le
n
wen-b-i=be
SG.N1=TOP
1SG eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL

wen-b-i=be
1SG eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
taro=SG.N1
Intended: ‘I’m eating the taro.’This restriction is independent of whether the verb marks the object or not.
Thus, (96) is bad as well.

a-têm’-Ø-i=be
1SG 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL

Intended: ‘I’ve seen the man.’I will mention here in passing that in (core-level) serial verb constructions,
overt object noun phrases can appear inside the verb serialization, if they are
exclusive to one of the verbs in the chain:

buried her’ not of haka ‘break’. For details, see section 11.1.1.3 on serial verb
constructions.","[388, 389, 390]"
"IntroductionThis chapter deals with the argument structure of the verb and with the order
of constituents in the clause. The unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV
in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses. While the verb is almost
always final in any clause (a marginal exception will be dealt with in 11.2.10),
the order of core arguments and adverbial adjuncts is less rigidly fixed.
This chapter also contains sections on non-verbal clauses, reciprocals and a
note on causatives.
Mian is head-marking at clause level (Nichols 1996). There is no
morphological case or adpositional marking for core grammatical relations.
Rather relevant syntactic relations are marked on the verb. Most arguments in
the clause, i.e. subjects, recipients, and for some verbs also the object, are
indexed on the verb by affixes.
Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and
impersonal (or atransitive) verbs. Compounding with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ with a
quasi-applicative function is used as a valency-increasing device in the
perfective to derive transitives from intransitives and ditransitives from
transitives in a highly productive way. In the imperfective, recipient suffixes
are directly appended to a verb to increase its valency.
The only clearly underived ditransitive verb in Mian is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’.
Underived ditransitives show triple agreement, i.e. they index the subject, the
object (the gift) and the recipient with an affix (see section 9.5 on
ditransitives).
Ambitransitive verbs (Dixon 1994, 2002) can be used intransitively or
transitively without any derivational process.
There are also a few impersonal verbs with an expletive subject marker,
which denote the arrival of morning and afternoon and the passage of time.
All finite verbs must contain a subject suffix indexing the subject of the
verb, which in the rare case of impersonal verbs is an expletive (-o). This form
is homophonous to the third person singular feminine subject marker.
I define the argument structures as follows:
-Intransitives have exactly one core argument (S).
Transitives have exactly two core arguments (both A and O).
Ditransitives have exactly three core arguments (A, O and R).",[357]
"Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of1.3. Typological profile7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect81. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominativeaccusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There1.3. Typological profile9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational101. The language and its speakersunit. Under no circumstances can the verb be followed by an overt core noun
phrase argument.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"Argument order in ditransitive clausesTo distinguish the two objects in ditransitive clauses I use the following
abbreviations: O - theme object and R - recipient object. In ditransitive9.10. Constituent order365clauses, unmarked constituent order (i.e. most frequent in the corpus) is A R O
V. There is a tendency to order overt object noun phrases according to
animacy. R much more frequently refers to humans (or at least to animates)
since it encodes recipients or benefactives. Hence, it tends to occur before O.
Ditransitive clauses in which all three core arguments are overtly realized
as free pronouns are unattested in the spontaneous corpus and only occur in
elicited material, e.g.:
(98)n
1SGkbo
2SG.M
3SG.N1tob-ûb’-ke-Ø-i-o=be
3SG.LONG.O-give.PFV-2SG.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
‘I’ve given it (i.e. LONG) to you.’
The same ordering principles can be observed when the objects are
instantiated by overt noun phrases, as in the following two examples:
(99)alél=o
wife=SG.Fal=o
bowels=PL.N1gwel-ûb’-o-s-e=a

Reverse order of objects, i.e. A O R V, is attested though much less frequent.
An example of this alternative constituent order in a ditransitive clause is

[MPIP Reciprocals, 28 (Evans et al. 2004)]
The most important generalization with respect to the position of the subject
noun phrase in ditransitive clauses is that it must not appear between the two
object noun phrases, i.e. the subject noun phrase can precede (102) or follow
the two objects together (103):

"An analytical issue in head-internal relative clausesSo far I have been assuming without justification that head-internal relatives
are clauses. It is now time to justify this assumption. Consider (70):
(70)naka=i
man=PL.ANbalubib=y
airstrip=atmâa’-bl-Ø-ib
stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ
li
DEM.PROX.PL.AN‘these men who are standing at the airstrip’
Now, it is not necessarily straightforward that an expression, such as in (70),
should be analysed as one clause with an overt subject noun phrase naka=i as
opposed to another theoretically possible analysis which breaks this
expression down into a nominal head nakai and an embedded postnominal
relative clause balubib y mâa’blib li.
There is prosodic and syntactic evidence that (70) is indeed a full clause
and not a head noun followed by a postnominal relative clause. Prosodically,
the whole string is one intonational unit, set off from the rest of the matrix
clause by a short pause. Hence, phonological evidence points towards an
analysis of head-internal relatives as single clauses.
Syntactic evidence comes from the simple fact that any head-internal
relative clause can have the constituent order which one would expect if they
were independent declarative sentences. Consider the following two headinternal relative clauses in (71) and (72):
(71)[naka=i] SBJ
man=PL.ANy
theremâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN

DEM.PROX.PL.AN‘these two marsupials which the man is carrying on his arm’
[Mammals and insects]
Not only do head-internal relative clauses display regular clausal syntax, i.e.
SV in intransitive clauses (71) and AOV in transitive ones (72), but the latter
example shows especially well that the head noun, here being the object,
occurs in its normal position within the clause and that it is not the case that
the head noun is followed by a postnominal relative clause.
Further evidence against an analysis which assumes postnominal relative
clauses comes from chained relative clauses with different overt subject noun
phrases. Consider (73):
(73)imak-wal
husband-PLbl-Ø-ib=a
stay.IPFV-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MEDnakamîn-wal
man-PLbl-Ø-ib=i

‘they (the Telefol women) told the(ir) husbands and brothers who
were there (at home) and then the brothers and husbands…’
[Mianmin and Telefomin]
In the face of this example, it would be very difficult to argue that the
utterance imak-wal bliba nakamîn-wal blibi is anything but a chain of two
clauses each with its own overt subject noun phrase, where the first clause has
a medial verb (bliba) and the second a final verb (blib) with the article =i.
Although chained clauses with medial verbs are dependent on the final verb in
the last clause of the chain regarding certain morphosyntactic information,
clause chains are essentially coordinate and not subordinate or embedded
structures.
There are, however, cases which prima facie conflict with the analysis that
head-internal relative clauses are single clauses rather than a head noun13.3. Relative clauses513followed by a postnominal relative clause. If the object is relativized and the
subject is overtly realized as a pronoun, the only attested word order is:
(74)naka=e
n
a-têm’-Ø-i=e
1SG 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M
man=SG.M
‘the man whom I saw’This case provides problematic evidence because the constituent order OAV,
which we find in (74) is not possible in independent sentences, if the subject is
a free (non-emphatic) pronoun. Compare (75) and (76):
(75)naka=e
n-ta
a-têm’-Ø-i=be
1SG-EMPH
3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
man=SG.M
‘I (i.e. not you) saw the man.’(76)*nakae n atêm’ibe
Intended: ‘I saw the man.’So we have to conclude that should we want to analyse (74) as a head-internal
relative clause, it would not conform to normal clausal syntax. There are two
ways out of this situation.
First, one could assume embedding for this special case and say that in
(74) a nominal antecedent naka=e is followed by an embedded postnominal
relative clause n a-têm’-Ø-i=e. Clearly this is unsatisfactory because (a)
under such an analysis only examples like (74) would involve embedding
whereas for all other cases there is no evidence for a postnominal embedded
relative clause at all. Such a solution makes the analysis of head-internal
relatives unnecessarily complicated. After all, head-internal relative clauses,
whether they conform to basic constituent order in declarative sentences or
whether they are deviant in that respect, are formally marked in the same way.
The second option is to assume that head-internal relative clauses are
single clauses, the corollary being that they can differ from simple declarative
sentences in that they are allowed to display a constituent order unattested in
simple declarative sentences.
This is clearly the way to go in the analysis of Mian. In discussing headinternal relatives (which he calls “zirkumnominal”, i.e. circum-nominal),
Lehmann (1984) proposes a distinction between a variant with a stationary
nucleus (i.e. unbewegter Nucleus) as opposed to a variant with a preposed
nucleus (i.e. vorangestellter Nucleus). On the issue of the head position in
head-internal relative clauses also see Basilico (1996). Languages which have
head-internal relative clauses can show both variants. Diegueño, for example,
usually has stationary nuclei but allows preposed ones as a secondary strategy51413. Embedding(Gorbet 1973). We find a similar situation in Mian. Stationary nuclei are the
norm but under special circumstances when an overt pronoun is involved and
the object is relativized, as in example (74) above, the preposed-nucleus
strategy is consistently chosen.","[537, 538, 539, 540]"

"3609. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseThe most common way of describing a reflexive situation is to replace the
object of a transitive verb with a reflexive pronoun. Compare (78) and (79):
(78)naka=e
aal=e
skin=SG.N1
man=SG.M
‘The man has cut the skin.’gò’-n-e=be
cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL(79)naka=e
-maye
3SG.M-REFL
man=SG.M
‘The man has cut himself.’gò’-n-e=be
cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECLReflexivization works productively with some transitive verbs, namely only
those which denote a physical action towards the self. The pronoun in (80) can
only have an emphatic but not a reflexive reading:
(80)naka=e
man=SG.M-maye
3SG.M-REFLkimâa’-bi-Ø-e=be
care_for.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘The man himself is caring for (someone).’
*‘The man is caring for himself.’
Mian does not have any lexically reflexive verbs, for which the reflexive
reading would be entailed. All grooming verbs are transitive and require an
object which refers to the affected body part:
(81)naka=e
man=SG.Mmináan=o
whisker=PL.N1deilâ’-n-e=be
remove_hair.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘The man has removed his whiskers.’ (i.e. ‘the man has shaved’)
The most frequent grooming verb (aaie) fuela/(aaie) fua ‘bathe’ is a nounverb idiom (see 8.10). It is interpreted as reflexive in its intransitive form, as
in (82):
(82)naka=e
aaie
fua-b-e=be
water bathe.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
man=SG.M
‘The man is bathing (himself).’9.9. Reflexivization361A transitive verb (aaie) fuela-/(aaie) fua- ‘bathe somebody’ can be derived
from the intransitive base. However, a reflexive reading is never possible for
the derived form:
(83)kbo
2SG.M
aaie
fuela-ˆt’-ne-n-al=e!
water
bathe.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT
‘(You should) Bathe me!’Although many transitive verbs that obligatorily index their objects with a
pronominal or a classificatory prefix denote concrete physical actions, none
can actually be used reflexively by having co-referent subject and object
markers. This is simply not permitted by the grammar. For these verbs, e.g.
-têm’ ‘see (PFV)’, the object prefix must never be co-referent with the subject
suffix. Hence, (84) is fine, (85) can only have a disjoint reading and (86) is
ungrammatical and does not have any meaning:
(84)a-têm’-Ø-i=be
3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
‘I saw him.’(85)a-têm’-Ø-e=be
3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘Hek saw himl.’
BUT: *‘He saw himself.’(86)*na-têm’-Ø-i=be
1SG.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
Intended: ‘I saw myself.’Apart from this systematic grammatical restriction, there are semantic and also
cultural reasons which militate against reflexivization. Consider the transitive
verbs -fû’/— ‘grab’ and -nâ’/— ‘hit, kill’. While one can grab or hold other
people, it is less clear how one would grab oneself and self-hitting and suicide
are not part of Mianmin culture.
However, to “see oneself” is both semantically plausible and culturally
appropriate. In former times the only surface which reflected properly was
water. Hence one used to say and in fact still says today:3629. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(87)naka=e

‘The man is looking at his (water-)reflection.’Although there are mirrors nowadays and the noun aakikit is actually used to
refer to mirrors, one still cannot “see oneself” in Mian. An alternative to (87)
is (88):

‘He’s looking at his face (implied: in the mirror).’Constituent orderThis section deals with the order of constituents in the clause. There are no
differences in constituent order possibilities between medial clauses, on the
one hand, and final clauses or independent sentences, on the other. The only
clause type which can show an order of constituents not attested in any other
clause type is the head-internal relative clause (see 13.3.7).
I will first describe the unmarked order of overtly realized argument noun
phrases (which is S/A followed by O) and then discuss deviations from it.
Finally, the position of different types of adverbs and adverbial adjuncts in
the clause will be discussed.","[385, 386, 387, 388]"
"The interrogative word wantl-Ø-eb-bu=e?
come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-GPST=CQThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:10.2. Content questions(44)lewan=e

follows the pronoun suffix -ta, this suffix is realized as -t, as in (46) and (47):

The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.

There is one case where the interrogative phrase seemingly does not appear in
situ. Consider the two semantically more or less equivalent utterances. In both

intonational break):

Compare constituent order in these two examples and also consider the order
in the possible declarative answer in (57), which is parallel in structure to
example (55):

The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is
marked for interrogative illocution, whereas (56), on the other hand, does not
consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le

"10.2. Content questions391The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:
(20)fàb
o-fâ-n-an=e?
where
3SG.RESID.O-put.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT =CQ
‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"
"2.8.2.4. Tone association in trisyllables
Trisyllabic nominals are rare in the language and many of them are probably
compounds historically. This is not problematic because in order to account
for tone in compounds we do not need any additional rules apart from those
already set up and all tonal melodies attested in compounds can also be found
on monomorphemic words.",[86]
"IntroductionNouns, adjectives, and verbs constitute open word classes. While the classes
of nouns and adjectives readily accept loans from Tok Pisin or English, verbal
loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian verbs,
but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in a
function verb construction. Mian is typically Papuan in that it makes a very
clear formal distinction between nouns and verbs (Himmelmann 2005: 126131).
All other word classes are closed, and with the exception of verbs rather
small. The closed word classes comprise the following parts of speech:
Articles
Prenominal modifiers
Adverbs
Pronouns
Directionals
Postpositions
Quantifiers
Conjunctions
Ideophones
Particles
In order to determine the defining features of a given word class, a
combination of morphosyntactic and distributional criteria will be employed.",[111]
"IntroductionMian, like the closely related Ok languages Telefol and Tifal, has a category
‘gender’, i.e. nouns are lexically specified for the gender they are assigned to
and require the agreement patterns associated with their gender (Corbett 1991,
Aikhenvald 2000). Mian has four genders: Masculine (M), feminine (F), neuter
1 (N1), and neuter 2 (N2).
Although gender is a nominal category, gender distinctions surface as
formal variation on agreeing categories, the agreement targets, which are
different from the noun. In Mian, agreeing categories within the noun phrase
are articles and determiners. Outside the noun phrase, pronominal affixes on
the verb, i.e. subject, object, and recipient markers, agree in gender with any
overtly realized arguments. In anaphoric agreement, pronouns and pronominal
affixes also agree in gender with a noun in a previously mentioned overt noun
phrase argument.
Mian does not mark gender overtly on the noun, i.e. there is no nominal
affix indicating the gender of a noun. I follow Corbett (1991: ch. 6), who
treats genders as formally defined by sets of agreement markers and not by
formal properties of the noun. In order to be able to say that a language has
gender, some formal marker has to be present on at least one category
different from the noun, which systematically covaries with the gender of the
noun (Corbett 1991: 105).",[195]
"ImperativeIn order to issue a direct command to a second person singular a bare
perfective verb stem with any obligatory classificatory prefixes and
pronominal object affixes is used, for example:
(203) baa
te
obbià
deibâ‘Say (it)!’
‘Come!’
‘Throw it!’8
‘Leave him!’9The exact semantic difference between these imperative forms and the
hortative forms in the second person singular described in the previous section
is hard to assess. It is my impression that a bare stem conveys a stronger
directive force than the hortative form of the same verb. As bare stems can
only refer to the second person singular and hortative forms are attested for all
person-number combinations, I am inclined to set up an additional category
‘Imperative’.
A similar situation (i.e. where there is a full hortative inflectional paradigm
and bare stems can be used for commands directed only at the second person
singular) can be found in the Papuan language Korafe (Farr 1999: 20, 30).
In order to issue a direct command to a second person plural a perfective
verb stem with any obligatory classificatory prefixes and pronominal object
affixes inflected with -i is used, e.g.:
(204) tl-Ø-i
un-Ø-i
obbià-Ø-i‘(You PL) Come!’
‘(You) Go!’
‘(You) Throw it!’These are obviously shortened forms from the hortative paradigm, namely
tline! ‘You (PL)/they should come!’, unine! ‘You (PL)/they should go!’, and
obbiàine! ‘You (PL)/they should throw!’.",[340]
"Attributive possessionAs we are dealing with noun phrase structure here, this section is confined to
attributive possession. For a description of predicative possession, see section
9.11.3.
Mian has one construction for encoding attributive possession in which the
possessor precedes the possessed. This is the typical order for verb-final
languages (Dryer 2007: 62). The possessor slot can be filled either by a
possessive pronoun or by a full noun phrase.
In the most common and least complex case the possessor slot is filled by a
possessive pronoun. The forms are set out in the tables 6.2 and 6.3. The free
pronoun forms have been included to illustrate the obvious formal relations
between the two pronoun series. Distinct forms for the possessive and the free
pronoun series are given in boldface. Grey areas indicate the neutralization of
a gender contrast.

milím=e
half=SG.N1
vagina=SG.N1 edge=SG.N1
‘half of the edge of the vagina’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Typically, there is no overt marker indicating a possessive relation. Rather,
possessor and possessed are simply juxtaposed:
(55)éil=e
gabáam=e
pig=SG.M head=SG.N1
‘a/the pig’s head’There is a clear syntactic structure in Mian attributive possessives. Changing
the order of possessor and possessed might at best considerably alter the
meaning but will in most cases lead to non-sensical utterances.
An alternative, though much less common construction involves the use of
an overt possessive pronoun between the possessor and the possessed, as in
the following example:
(56)éil=e

gabáam=e
head=SG.N1
pig=SG.M 3SG.M
‘a/the pig’s head’ (lit. ‘a/the pig, its head’)This construction is rare and it is my impression that it is predominantly found
where the possessor is a proper name, as in (57). Note, however, that this
could also be rendered as Selimine kukub le with the same meaning:
(57)

obligatory. This is illustrated for two different types of coordination, namely

in (59).

Fitibkanib=oDimosonPN=SG.FPNTwo issues remain to be addressed in connection with possessive
constructions in Mian. The first problem is how far possessive constructions
can be straightforwardly distinguished from compounding. The second issue
has to do with constituent order in the noun phrase, especially with the
evidence for assuming both a possessor slot and a prenominal adjective slot.
In some cases the distinction between a possessive construction and a
compound is fuzzy. Consider the example al atosîn [bowels bit(s)]. Would
this be better glossed as ‘bit(s) of bowels’ or as ‘bowel bit(s)’? While both
analyses seem possible, it is noticeable that in al atosîn the first noun appears
without an article or any other adnominal pronoun, which make the whole
construction look like two compounded stems. Hence, I opt for the compound
analysis here. If the first element in a complex noun phrase appears without an
article (and without any other pronominal element), the construction is a
compound (i.e. al atosîn ‘bowel bit(s)’). If the first noun is followed by an
article, the construction is possessive (i.e. al=o atosîn ‘bit of bowels’). See
Healey (1965a: 10-11) for a description of a similar problem in Telefol. Tonal
evidence supports this analysis. Compounds constitute a single tonal domain.
The tone on the compound is a composite melody consisting of a sequence of
the respective stem melodies and is assigned to the compound as a whole. In a
possessive construction, possessor and possessed constitute two distinct tonal
domains.
As far as the ordering of possessor and possessed is concerned, there is
syntactic evidence that the position of the possessor must be to the left of the
possessed noun with all its adjectival modifiers, rather than just to the left of
the noun. Although the standard word order in modified noun phrases is noun
head followed by one or more postnominal modifiers, the adjectival modifiers
sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’, tend to occur before the head noun:
(60)n
1SG.POSSsin
oldfanin=e
grandfather=SG.M2206. The noun phrasegen-b-e=be
be_sick.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘My old grandfather is sick.’
In example (60), sin ‘old’ can only be interpreted as a modifier. Hence, to say
that the possessor slot immediately precedes the noun would be inaccurate.
Rather, the possessor slot immediately precedes the noun with all its
modifiers.","[242, 243, 244, 245, 246]"
"DitransitivesThe verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an underived ditransitive. It belongs to the class
of verbs which obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e.
the gift, with a classificatory prefix (see 9.2.1). In addition, it also takes an
object suffix that cross-references the recipient argument (plus another suffix
for the subject). Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an examples of triple agreement,
i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects (theme and recipient) by affixes on
the verb (Fedden 2010). Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon,
both in Papuan languages and world-wide (Foley 2000). An example of -ûb’‘give (PFV)’ is given in (55):3529. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause(55)n
1SGnaka=e
man=SG.Méil=o
pig=SG.Fom-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be
3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
‘I gave the sow to the man.’
For details on the derived nature of the imperfective counterpart -ka- ‘give
(IPFV)’, the reader is referred to 9.6.2.2.
The ditransitive verb -fu- ‘send to (PFV-only)’1 involves compounding with
-ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in order to introduce the recipient argument. It indexes the
theme with a classificatory prefix. The recipient argument is marked by a
suffix on the ‘give’-morpheme compounded with the main verb. Consider
example (56):
(56)
3SG.Fbaa-n-o=a
say.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MEDfutâan=o
letter=N2om-fu-ˆb’-a-n-amab-i=bo
3SG.F_CL.O-send.PFV-give.PFV-2SG.R-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ1SG.SBJ=QUOT
ge
baa-n-o=be
say.PFV-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
say.PFV
‘She said she would send a letter to him.’ (lit. ‘She said: “I will
send a letter to him.” ’)
Although the recipient role of -fu- ‘send to (PFV)’ is obligatorily introduced
through serialization with ‘give’, which suggests derivation from a simpler
transitive base, such a transitive base does not exist: *-fu ‘send (PFV)’. Hence,
an utterance like (57) is ungrammatical regardless of whether the recipient is
expressed with a free noun phrase (in this case the pronoun n ‘me’):
(57)*futaan=o
(n)
om-fu-n-e=be
(1SG) 3SG.F_CL.O-send.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
letter=N2
Intended: ‘He sent (me) a letter.’The same applies to ale- ‘show’, which lacks a transitive base *ale. As for -fu‘send to (PFV)’, the recipient argument, or in the case of ‘show’ the recipientlike argument, is introduced by ‘give’ in the perfective. The theme participant,
i.e. the ‘shown’, is never cross-referenced on the verb by a pronominal affix
but can be encoded as a free noun phrase, as in (58):9.6. Derived ditransitives(58)353kasak=e
kasak_ritual=SG.N1
ale-ˆb’-e-Ø-ib-bio=ta
show-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=MED
‘they had shown us the Kasak (ritual), and then someone else...’
[Kasak ritual]In natural Mian discourse overt noun phrase arguments are typically elided if
their identity is retrievable from the context even if the argument is not
indexed on the verb. Parallel to the case of elided object noun phrases in
transitive verbs, which were discussed in section 9.2.4 above, I have no
evidence suggesting that the verb ale- ‘show’ becomes monotransitive, i.e.
only has a subject and a recipient object (indexed with a suffix), when the
overt object noun phrase (referring to the entity shown) is elided. Therefore, I
analyse ale- ‘show’ as an underived ditransitive verb whose object noun
phrase can be freely elided without assuming a change in argument structure.
To sum up, the clearest example of an underived ditransitive verb in Mian
is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’. It encodes the theme with a set of prefixes and the
recipient and the subject with two different sets of suffixes. In the case of -fu‘send to (PFV)’, we are dealing with a lexicalization, which is underived (at
least in contemporary Mian). A similar argument can be made for ale- ‘show
to (PFV)’.","[377, 378, 379]"

"Verb serialization versus compounding (synopsis)In this section I outline the main differences between verb serialization and
V-V compounds and give a synopsis of these differences. For more on V-V
compounds, see 3.2.2. V-V compounds are similar to nuclear SVCs. They are
restricted to two verb stems, they do not allow separate objects and they do
not allow aspect to be at variance. However, a V-V compound is always
realized as a single phonological word. It constitutes a single domain for tone
assignment, whereas the verbs in nuclear SVCs are phonologically
independent, constituting two separate tonal domains. Furthermore, the stems
in V-V compounds can show some degree of fusion of the verb stems. So
while nuclear SVCs are only grammatical but not phonological units, V-V
compounds are both grammatical and phonological units. See Crowley (1987:
59-61) for a similar argument for the distinction of nuclear SVCs and
compounds in Paamese.
An example of a Mian V-V compound is given in (20):
(20)no=i
marsupials=PL.AN
ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘he killed and took the marsupials and then he…’ [Crows]The compound is ya-l-êt ‘kill and take them’. Semantically, these describe
discrete events, a ‘killing’-event and a ‘taking’-event. The two serialized verb
stems are -lò ‘kill (PFV)’ and -êb ~ -êt ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’, which
share the same aspectual value ‘perfective’ and the same object, i.e. no=i ‘the
marsupials’. The sequence of verbs is realized as a single phonological word
and shows fusion due to the deletion of /o/ (-lò ‘kill’ > l). The HL tonal
melody on -lò ‘kill’ is deleted before a verb with a LHL melody and the LHL
melody of -êb ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’ applies to the entire verb in (20).
The first stem -lò ‘hit, kill (PFV)’ cross-references the object of the whole
sequence noi ‘the marsupials’ with the object prefix ya-, while the second
stem -êb drops its classificatory prefix under argument identity. Outside of
nuclear serializations the verb -êb ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’ obligatorily
occurs with a classificatory object prefix, as in (21):11.1. Serial verb constructions(21)éil

‘ “They had killed a whole pig, brought it, and put it down!”
’[Kasak ritual]
A selection of V-V compounds is given in table 11.2. The reader will note that
many of these have unpredictable meanings. More examples can be found in
section 3.2.2.

‘create’The verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is used with a quasi-applicative function to
introduce an additional argument (usually a recipient, benefactive, malefactive, goal of ballistic motion, or experiencer). An example is provided in (22):
(22)kasak=e
kasak=SG.N1
ale-ˆb’-e-Ø-ib-bio=ta
show-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=MED
‘they had shown us the kasak (ritual), and then someone else...’
[Kasak]For a detailed description of this construction, see 8.5.5. Phonologically,
sequences of verb plus -ûb- ‘give (PFV)’ are most similar to V-V compounds.

"Verbs with obligatory classificatory prefixBelow are listed the most frequent verbs which require a classificatory prefix.
In a few cases, the classificatory prefix is frozen in the singular form of the
residue class ob-, e.g. ase ob-tanà/ase ob-tunu ‘light with fire’ and aaie ob-dî
‘fetch water’. In the case of the perfective-only stem -kilêb ‘put handle of bag
around forehead so that the bag hangs down the bag (in order to carry the
bag)’ the prefix is frozen as go- from the bundle class.

nominal classification systems, which show different formal and semantic
properties, exist next to and interact with each other.
First, there is the category ‘gender’ with the masculine, feminine, neuter 1
and 2 subcategories. All pronominal affixes on the verb agree in person,
number and gender with the arguments they cross-reference. If the verb occurs
without overt noun phrase arguments, pronominal affixes agree anaphorically
with a previously mentioned overt noun phrase argument.
These instances of agreement are predictable from the person, number and
gender of the nominal argument. In other words, pronominal affixes never
have any semantic impact on the noun or its noun phrase. Their function is to
indicate grammatical relations in the clause and to enable construal of any
overt arguments with their respective cross-referencing affix by showing
agreement.
In addition, there are the categories (prefix classes) established by sets of
classificatory prefixes. There are four reasons why I consider this system of
classificatory prefixes to be different from the system of gender agreement.
First, only some verbs with similar semantics of object manipulation or
handling participate in the system of classificatory prefixes, whereas
pronominal affixes can be found on all finite verbs.","[220, 221]"
"2166. The noun phraseConstituent order in relative clauses is no different from the order in
independent clauses, with one noteworthy exception where the internal head
of a relative clause shows some mobility unattested in simple declarative
sentences (see 13.3.7). Verbs in relative clauses show all inflectional
possibilities of a (sentence-final) verb in an independent sentence in terms of
tense, aspect, mood, and argument marking. For example, they can be
inflected for irrealis or deontic mood, which medial verbs cannot.
Head-internal relative clauses are much more frequent than prenominal
ones in natural discourse. Nearly all examples of prenominal relative clauses
are elicited. However, in most cases the prenominal variant of a head-internal
relative clause was offered immediately by the speaker without any further
question as to whether a prenominal relative construction was also possible.","[241, 242]"
"IntroductionAs my analysis of the tonal system of Mian is decidedly different from Smith
and Weston’s (1974a: 12-13, 25-28) approach, a few words about their work
are in order to orient the reader. Smith and Weston implicitly analyse Mian as
a syllable tone language with the restriction that contour tones are only ever
allowed on the final syllable of a word. Their treatment of the tonal phonology
includes indication of tones in phonemic and phonetic representations for
about 200 words (mainly nouns and adjectives). Further, there is a list of a
few, mainly near-minimal, tone pairs which lead them to establish four
phonemic tones, namely low, high, rising, and falling. The paper ends with a
short text of nine lines in which tonal specifications are included. In their
analysis, each vowel is a tone-bearing unit and is permitted to bear any one of
the phonemic tones. Recall from the section on vowel length (2.3) that Smith
and Weston treat long vowels as nuclei of two different adjacent syllables, so
long vowels effectively bear two tones. Smith and Weston (1974a) only
indicate tone in phonemic and phonetic representations, not in their
orthography, so none of their other publications on the Mian language, their
translation of the New Testament included, have tone specifications.
There are two major problems with Smith and Weston’s analysis of Mian
as a syllable tone language.
First, only a few of the logically possible tonal melodies occur on words
with one to three syllables. If a language that distinguishes four melodies was
a syllable tone language, the logically possible number of tone patterns would
be 4 for monosyllables, 16 for disyllables, and 64 for trisyllables. Even with
the restriction that contour tones can only appear on final syllables, the
logically possible number of tonal melodies by far exceeds the number of
actually attested patterns. We only need five melodies to account for the tonal
patterns on mono-, di- and trisyllables, namely L, H, LH, LHL, and HL.
Second, the Smith and Weston analysis misses the important generalization
that the same tonal melody is found in /Lam/ [am] ‘house’ and /Libal/ [ial]
‘dust’, and likewise in /LHmn/ [mn] ‘string bag’ and /LHninin/ [ninín] ‘name’.",[73]
"269Object suffix (indirective alignment)Recipients are marked on the ditransitive verbs -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka‘give (IPFV)’ with a suffix. Both belong to the class of verbs which
obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e. the gift, with a
classificatory prefix. In addition, they also take a suffix that cross-references
the recipient (plus another suffix for the subject). While many Papuan
languages display secundative alignment for the recipient in ditransitives, they
treat the recipient like the object of a monotransitive verb, the alignment for
the recipient argument in Mian is indirective, i.e. recipients are marked
different from objects of monotransitive verbs.
Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ are examples of triple
agreement, i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects by affixes on the verb.
Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon, both in Papuan
languages and world-wide .
An example of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is provided in (72):
(72)n
1SGnaka=e
man=SG.Méil=o
pig=SG.Fom-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be
3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
‘I gave the sow to the man.’
As in transitive clauses, none of the overt arguments n ‘I’, naka=e ‘the man’,
or éil=o ‘the sow’ in this example are marked for their syntactic role within
the clause. Construal of grammatical roles proceeds by aligning the overt noun
phrases with the agreeing pronominal affixes on the verb. In this case, n ‘I’ is
the subject because -i ‘first person singular subject’ is in the subject slot of the
verb, and the noun phrases naka=e ‘the man’ and éil=o ‘the sow’ appear in a
double object construction. Each object is indexed in a different way on the
verb, naka=e ‘the man’ as the recipient object and éil=o ‘the sow’ as the
theme object.
Like subject marking, recipient marking is suffixal and it is likewise
obligatory. Unlike subject and object marking, however, recipient marking is
sensitive to whether the marking suffix occurs in imperfective or perfective
verb forms (see below). The set of recipient suffixes occurring with -ûb’‘give (PFV)’ is summarized in table 8.4. Grey areas indicate the neutralization
of a gender contrast. For ease of exposition, only the ûb-paradigm, i.e. the
suffixes following -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, is given here. Further below these forms
are contrasted with the forms from the ka-paradigm, used in the imperfective.
Recipient arguments of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ are always animate.",[295]
"VerbsAs verbs are morphologically by far the most complex word class in Mian, I
will only be concerned with the defining features at this point and only give a
few examples to illustrate the most fundamental points about verb inflection in
Mian. For a detailed treatment of the morphology of the verb the reader is
referred to chapter 8.
Loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian
verbs, but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in
a function verb construction:

do-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECLMian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and impersonal
(atransitive) verbs. Transitives can be productively derived from intransitives
and ditransitives from transitives. On basic argument structures and derived
ones, see sections 9.1 to 9.7.
Semantically, verbs refer to actions, processes, and states. Verbs fulfil the
function of the predicate of a clause.
Suprasegmentally, verbs are either unaccented, in which case they are alllow, or are lexically specified for an accent to which one of two complex tonal
melodies (either HL or LHL) is assigned. Nouns, on the other hand, are
associated with one of five tonal melodies.
Syntactically, verbs are easily identified. Mian is an SOV language.
Although there is some pragmatically motivated variability with respect to the
position of subject and object, the last word in a clause is almost always the
verb and under no circumstances can the verb be followed by any of its
arguments. Occasionally, however, one finds locative adjuncts postposed after
the verb which are adverbial modifiers of the preceding verb syntactically, but
which form their own intonational unit (see 11.2.10).
Morphologically, verbs can index their core arguments with pronominal
affixes cross-referencing subject (37) and object (38):1023. Word classes and grammatical relations(37)lo

For more information on the indexation of arguments on the verb, see the
sections 3.14 on grammatical relations, 8.5 on argument marking, and 9.2 on
transitive verbs.
Final verbs, i.e. verbs in independent sentences or in final clauses of clause
chains, can be inflected for various aspectual categories, e.g. -b ‘Imperfective’
(39), modal categories, e.g. -n ‘Realis’ (40), and temporal categories, e.g. -s
‘Remote past’ (41):

‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]Medial verbs, i.e. verbs in non-final clauses in clause chains, can be inflected
for co- or disjoint reference of the subject in the succeeding clause in
combination with sequentiality or simultaneity of events. In (42), the suffix -b
‘DS.SIM’ indicates that the event described in the first clause is on-going
when the event described by the second clause takes place and that this second
clause has a different subject:

A subset of verbs, almost all of which make predications of handling or
movement, has an obligatory classificatory prefix which classifies one of the
arguments according to semantic characteristics, namely sex, form, and
function, on an absolutive basis. In (43), the object fukêt ‘smoking gourd’ is
classified as belonging to the residue class.

About half of the verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with a
perfective/imperfective contrast. The rest are trans-aspectual, i.e. they have
only one stem which is vague with respect to aspect. A few verbs are defective
and lack either a perfective or an imperfective stem. Formally distinct
perfective and imperfective stems are subject to certain inflectional
restrictions, e.g. a perfective stem cannot be directly inflected for imperfective
aspect but has to enter an auxiliary construction. Trans-aspectual stems are not
restricted in terms of their inflectional morphology.
For certain tense-aspect combinations, some verbs cannot be inflected
directly, but have to be serialized with the existential verb functioning as an
auxiliary before inflection can proceed:
(44)fu
unan-biaana-b-io=be

eat.IPFV-AUX.HAB.PST-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
‘They used to cook and eat (some kind of fruit) until now.’Two verb stems can be compounded into one phonological and grammatical
verbal word which forms a single predication denoting a single event. Verbs
also frequently appear in serial verb constructions in which only the last verb
is fully inflected and all preceding verbs are either bare verb stems or stems
with affixes indexing any object(s) but lack TAM inflection or marking for1043. Word classes and grammatical relationssubject, polarity or illocutionary force. Mian allows verb serialization at the
core or the nuclear level. See 11.1 for a detailed description of verb

Inquiring about quantities was presumably not a common activity in a society

that the meaning ‘how many’ for fatnàmin developed as a secondary sense
from ‘what, what kind of’.","[422, 423]"
"Position of temporal nounsTemporal expressions are for example sinanggwâno ‘in days of yore’ or
memâlo ‘now, today’ (see 3.1.9). In contrast to adverbs and postpositional

"Core-level serial verb constructionsCore SVCs consist of several verb stems which are concatenated to form a
temporally iconic sequence of predications, i.e. the events denoted by the
verbs within a SVC take place in the order they are uttered. The attested
maximum is a serialization of eight verbs, cf. example (14) below. In core
SVCs, each verb is phonologically independent, i.e. it constitutes its own
domain with respect to tone assignment.
SVCs at core level are of low semantic integration. Every verb stem
constitutes a predicate and each predicate can have its own objects. In other
words, each verb stem in a SVC takes its own argument structure into the
SVC and they can either exist next to each other or be intertwined, i.e. verbs in
a SVC can – and commonly do – share object arguments. The stem aspect of
the verbs in a core SVC can vary freely. Core SVCs are semantically
compositional and the degree of lexicalization is very low.",[432]

The ditransitive verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is productively used in a compound
with another verb stem as a valency-increasing device with an applicative-like
function. The use of ‘give’ as a valency-increasing device is attested in a
number of TNG languages. It is a recurrent pattern in TNG languages that
they use compounds or serializations with ‘give’ to express recipient or
benefactive arguments (Foley 1986, Foley 2000, Reesink in prep.), for
example Kewa (Franklin 1971), Menya (Whitehead 2004), and Tairora
(Vincent 1973).4
In Mian, almost all intransitive and transitive verbs can be compounded
with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in order to introduce another participant into the
argument structure of the verb through the recipient suffix on the ‘give’-verb.
This type of compounding is only used in the perfective. The spectrum of
semantic roles that can be mapped onto this additional argument is quite wide
and includes not only recipients but also benefactives, possessors, and goals of
ballistic motion, depending on the semantics of the verb serialized with ‘give’.","[298, 299]"
"1. The language and its speakersMian wéng: The Mian languageMian (also known as ‘Mianmin’ or ‘Miyanmin’ in the literature, ISO mpt) is a
Papuan language of the Ok family. The term ‘Papuan’ is not to be understood
as a name for a well-defined language family but as a residue category for the
non-Austronesian and non-Australian languages of the south-west Pacific
(Foley 1986, 2000).
The Ok family of languages belongs to the larger Trans New Guinea
(TNG) family, and is of roughly the same order of internal diversification as
Germanic within Indo-European (Healey 1964a, Wurm 1982, Pawley 2005).
The Ok languages are named after the widespread cognate ok ‘river, water’ in
these languages.2 Mian is spoken by fewer than two thousand people in the
north-west of Telefomin District in Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea.",[28]

"3. Word classes and grammatical relationsObjectMian has a single grammatical relation of object, which can be
morphologically indexed in different ways, so that the indexing patterns on the
verb do not correspond to the grammatical relations which can be established
on syntactic grounds. All objects can be modified, quantified, topicalized and
questioned. All objects can be relativized as well, but the relativization options
are subject to some restrictions for verbs which do not index their object. This
will be discussed in more detail below.
In all cases, the object is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the object index on
the verb. Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked. The way objects
are indexed on the verb depends on lexical factors. There are four distinct
patterns of object indexation.
First, the object can be marked by a pronominal prefix according to an
accusative pattern, e.g.:
(213) no=i
marsupial=PL.AN
ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘he killed and brought/carried the marsupials and then ...’ [Crows]
Semantically, objects indexed with a pronominal prefix mostly have the role
of patient.
Second, the object can be marked by a classificatory prefix according to an
absolutive pattern, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (214) or the subject of an
intransitive verb (215) are indexed, e.g.:
(214) ti=e
blade=SG.Mbáangkli=e
stone_adze=SG.Mdeb-êt-n-o=a
3SG.M_CL.O-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
‘she carried a báangkli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]
(215) Dabeinom-mêin
tl-Ø-o=ta
3SG.F-CL.SBJ-fall.PFV
come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]
PN3.14. Grammatical relations165Semantically, objects indexed with a classificatory prefix mostly have the role
of theme or patient.
Third, the object can be marked by a pronominal suffix according to an
indirective pattern. In the perfective, the suffix must be appended to -ûb’‘give’, which is compounded with another verb. In the imperfective,
suffixation is directly to the stem. For a detailed description, see 8.5.5.
(216) unáng=o
baa-ˆb’-o-n-e=o=le
woman=SG.F say.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=N2=TOP
‘and when he said to the woman’ [Pig story]
Such objects most commonly have the role of recipient, benefactive,
malefactive, possessor, or experiencer. Finally, there are verbs which never
mark their object, e.g.:
(217) unín=o
dowôn’-Ø-i=a
eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
food=N2
‘I eat food and then someone else ...’ [Newlyweds]
In this case, there is no indicator on the verb which makes the object relation
explicit, so the object is the noun phrase which is not indexed on the verb. In
most cases animacy differences (objects of verbs without object prefix are
overwhelmingly inanimate) and the semantics and context of the whole
utterance also help identify the object. Furthermore, many verbs without an
object prefix only occur with a relatively small range of possible object noun
phrases, as in the case of halbû’ ‘fold (IPFV)’, or even only with a single
possible object noun phrase (as in the case of êi ‘accumulate, impound
(water)’ or kè ‘cut (scraped taro) into slabs’, for which the objects can only
ever be aai ‘water’ and imen nini ‘scraped taro’, respectively.
The absence of the prefix on these verbs has a syntactic consequence.
When a verb does not index its object relativization with a prenominal relative
clause is impossible and relativization with a head-internal relative clause is
only possible if the head is not omitted. This is illustrated in the following
examples. A prenominal relative clause is not allowed when the object is not
indexed, as in (218), but is fine when it is indexed, as in (219):
(218) *n

man=SG.M1663. Word classes and grammatical relationsteke=o=be

‘The man I see is tall.’
In a head-internal relative clause the head must not be left out, if the verb does
not index the object, as in (220):
(220) *n
fu-n-i=o
ayam=o=be
cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2
good=PRD=DECL
1SG
Intended: ‘What I’ve cooked is good.’
Examples (221) and (222) show that a head-internal relative clause is possible
whether the overt object noun phrase is present or not, if the verb indexes its
object.

unín=o

food=N2 cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2
1SG
‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’ayam=o=be
good=PRD=DECLThe evidence suggests that relativization is only allowed, if the relativized
object is present in the clause in some way or other, either as a prefix or as an
overt noun phrase. Thus, the syntactic effect correlates with a morphological
effect, namely the presence or absence of the prefix. As this is more a
morphological issue than a syntactic one I do not see a reason why the nonsubject noun phrases of verbs like fu ‘cook’, which do not cross-reference this
noun phrase with a prefix, should not be objects.
To sum up, Mian has one grammatical relation of object, which can be
marked in three different ways. The object can also be not marked on the verb.","[190, 191, 192]"
"197ReclassificationReclassification refers to a different categorization of a noun due to the choice
of a different classificatory prefix in order, for example, to highlight a certain
feature of the referent. Reclassification in Mian mainly applies to nouns whose
referents are or can somehow be handled like bags, for instance bundles of
firewood or substantial chunks of pork which have a string or rope attached to
them. This characteristic of the referent is not expressed in the noun, but in the
classificatory prefix. An example of reclassification by using a different
classificatory prefix is given in (27) and (28):
(27)éil=o
om-fâ-n-e=be
pork=N2 3SG.F_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He put down the (piece of) pork.’(28)éil=o
gol-meki-n-e=be
pork=N2 3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He hung up the (piece of) pork (on a string).’In this case, the semantic impact of the classificatory prefixes of the bundle
class is hard to miss. The information that the referent of the object, namely
the meat, comes with a string or rope attached so that it can be carried around
or hung up like a bag or bundle does not reside in the noun itself, nor is it
included in the semantics of the verb stem. It might be argued that the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’ necessarily takes gol-/gulel- as a prefix because its
semantics suggest that in order to hang something up it must be bundle-like or
at least have a handle. However, sosbên, a Tok Pisin loan which refers to
metal pots of various sizes with handles, cannot occur with the bundle class
prefixes, even though the action of hanging them up can be referred to by
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’:
(29)sosbên=e
ob-meki-n-e=be / *gol-meki-n-e=be
3SG.RESID.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
pot=SG.N1
‘He hung up the pot.’Thus, the “hang-upability” of referents of objects of the verb -meki ‘hang up
(PFV)’ is more a selectional restriction of this verb rather than having anything
to do with the presence of the bundle class prefixes gol-/gulel-.
In general the choice of a different prefix subtly changes the semantics of
an utterance. Compare:1985. Classificatory verb prefixes(30)som=e
banana_bunch=SG.N1
dob-meki-n-e=be
3SG.M_CL.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He hung up the banana bunch (e.g. the whole bunch on a nail).’(31)som=e
banana_bunch=SG.N1
gol-meki-n-e=be
3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘He hung up the banana bunch (to which a string or rope is
attached).’In (31), som=e ‘a/the banana bunch’ is reclassified as a bundle-like object.
Although the object is the same in (30) and (31), namely som=e in both cases,
the choice of prefixes indicates that in the former example the bunch of
bananas itself is hung over a hook or nail whereas in the latter example the
bunch has some string or rope attached to it, which is slipped over a hook or
nail.
Example (31) can also have a different meaning, namely that the referent
of the object is a bag full of bananas. Bundle class prefixes can indicate that
the referent of the object is contained in a bag:
(32)tóm=e
gol-meki-n-e=be
3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
stone=SG.N1
‘He hung up a bag full of stones.’If several bags are involved, the difference in number is expressed on the
article and on the verbal prefix, but the fact that the objects are in a bag is
solely conveyed by the bundle class prefix:
(33)tóm=o
gol-meki-n-e=be
PL.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
stone=PL.N1
‘I hung up bags full of stones.’The reclassification of a noun as bundle-like is not restricted to the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’. This can be seen in the following example:5.10. Reclassification(34)199mn=e

[Afoksitgabáam]This sentence is from a story in which a pregnant woman is savaged by a wild
boar who tears her open, takes her unborn son, still attached to the umbilical
cord (the handle, so to say), and throws him on the ground. (The whole story
can be found in the text collection in appendix 1.)
Reclassification of yóum ‘piece of clothing’, which is by default M-class
(35), to the covering class is exemplified in (36):
(35)yóum=e

piece_of_clothing=SG.N1
geme-tlâa’-n-ebo=be
PL.COVER.O-remove.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL‘You undressed (lit. ‘removed your clothes).’
What the reclassification of ‘clothes’ effects in this case is the highlighting of
the fact that they had covered a person’s body before they were removed, as
stated in the utterance in (36) above.
Another example of reclassification is provided in (37):
(37)
tob-ò-n-e=a
3SG.M 3SG.LONG.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘he took it (i.e. his long penis) and then ...’ [Selimin]In this example, the classificatory prefix tob- refers anaphorically back to the
previously mentioned éit ‘penis’, which is assigned to the residue class by
default. However, in order to emphasize the enormous length of the
protagonist’s member, the speaker uses the prefix of the long class.
All of these examples illustrate that reclassification can be used quite
creatively in Mian.","[223, 224, 225]"
"Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):
(1)klayâm

‘Your boy is still small.’
The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.

As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:

both speaker and addressee are members to perform a certain action:

be used. The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with
the range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative
non-verbal clauses. Detailed information on non-verbal clauses can be found
in section 9.11.

"44211. Chaining constructionsExamples of languages in which S/R is only obligatory in the third person or
even restricted to third person, are Gokana (Comrie 1983), Kaingáng
(Wiesemann 1982) and Yup’ik (Woodbury 1983). Whether these are
uncontroversial examples of S/R languages3 is not important here, but clearly,
if S/R is fully functional only for certain person-number combinations, one
would not expect this to be the case in the first person singular, where it is
functionally unnecessary for reference resolution.
On the other hand, Mian can afford to renounce some of the
disambiguation work in reference tracking normally done by a S/R system for
two reasons:
(a) all medial verbs are obligatorily marked for person and number of the
subject, and
(b) Mian uses gender as a reference-tracking device, and the cross-referencing
subject markers index the gender of the subject.
For example, in (75) the gender difference reflected in the subject suffixes
forces a disjoint-reference interpretation of subjects:
(75)mn=e
child=SG.Mdo-fâ-n-o=a
3SG.M.O-put.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MEDme-b-e=be
cry.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘She gave birth to a boy and he is crying.’
The only two cases which cannot be disambiguated by the subject suffix and
the gender value expressed in it are those where:
(a) both subjects have the same gender (or subject markers are
homophonous)4, or
(b) both subjects are marked with -ib ‘second/third person animate plural’ on
the verb (In the plural all gender contrasts are neutralized).
In situations in which person, number, or gender marking does not
disambiguate speakers consistently employ DS marking, e.g.:
(76)fote-ˆb’-e-Ø-ib=a
rout-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-DS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining443dala-n-ib=a=le
go_away-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED=TOP
‘They (the Telefomin men) routed them (the Mianmin men) and they
(the Mianmin) went away and then…’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]
Out of context, each of the subject markers (-ib) in (76) could also be second
person plural but in the historical account from which the example was taken
the meaning is unequivocally third person plural.
If speakers use SS-marking with a series of subjects of the same gender,
they (re-)introduce an overt noun phrase in order to disambiguate subject
reference, as in (77):
(77)dekéng=e
dama-n-e=to
vine_species=SG.N1 grow_up.PFV-SEQ-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
dafinau=e
tm

tl-Ø-e-bio=to
come.PFV-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ-GPST=MED
‘The dekeng vine grew up and after the dafinau vine branched off it,
(the ancestors…)’ [Dafinau]This means that a sentence like (78) is not ambiguous, since the gender of the
subject forces a conjoint reading:
(78)mn=e

cry.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
‘Shek gave birth to a boy and shek is crying.’
Although it is possible to have -n on the verb in the marked clause (unless the
subject is first person singular), here dofânoa, followed by a different subject
in the reference clause, an overt noun phrase (e.g. unáng mak=o [woman
other=SG.F] ‘another woman’) would have to be used in the reference clause
to make an interpretation of the subjects as disjoint in reference available.
Without such an overt noun phrase, subjects in (78) must be interpreted as coreferential.","[467, 468, 469]"
"Transitives with classificatory prefix (absolutive alignment)Subclass 1 of transitive verbs comprises those verbs with classificatory

"1163. Word classes and grammatical relationsIf a noun and an adjective occur in a head-modifier relation in a noun
phrase, both constituents can be followed by an article (or other adnominal
determiner) reflecting number and gender:
(72)tíl=e
sm=e
big=SG.M
dog=SG.M
‘the big dog’Alternatively, – and this is more common in natural discourse – a single article
follows the rightmost constituent. Semantically, the utterances in (72) and (73)
are equivalent:
(73)tíl
sm=e
dog
big=SG.M
‘the big dog’A small subset of adjectives, e.g. sm ‘big, loud, much’, gwáab ‘small, soft,
little’, ayam ‘good’, and misiam ‘bad’, but not ninik ‘dirty’ or teke(bmín)
‘long’, nor any of the colour adjectives, can be used adverbially to modify a
verb. Adjectives with adverbial function are not followed by an article and
occur immediately before the verb they modify. Two examples are given
below:

‘song(s)’:

moton ‘true’, mubiang ‘last’, sm ‘big, loud’.
A sizable subset of adjectives can be used as a secondary predicate in a
clause. Secondary predicates look like adjectives with adverbial function, i.e.
they occur before the verb without a determiner, but their function is not to
modify the event but to make a predication about an argument of the verb, as

Common nouns and adjectives are formally very similar. Both categories
are without any inflectional morphology. Like nouns, adjectives can function
as the predicate in non-verbal clauses and can have verbs derived from them
with the inchoative derivational suffix -an, expressing the inception of the
state or property denoted by the adjective.
Most adjectives do not reduplicate productively. There are a few
lexicalized adjective reduplications, such as kengkeng ‘tiny’, ningning
‘thorny’, gliglî ‘rough’, and dangdang ‘thin’. The adjectives sm, in the sense
of ‘great’ (not dimensional “bigness”) and afet ‘different’ can be used in
reduplicated form to emphasize plurality or variety (see 6.3.4).
Adjectives can appear on their own as headless adjectives in noun phrases
without an overt nominal head. Compare (80) with an adjectival modifier and
(81) with a headless adjective:
(80)tíl=e
sm=e
big=SG.M
dog=SG.M
‘Look at the big dog!’a-têm’-Ø-al=e!
3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT(81)sm=e
a-têm’-Ø-al=e!
3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT
big=SG.M
‘Look at the big (one)!’Examples like (81) could be taken as evidence to claim that Mian lumps
adjectives and nouns together in a single word class. However, we need to set
up a class of adjectives distinct from nouns for two reasons.
First, there is a clear syntactic ordering principle between noun head and
adjectival modifier within the noun phrase. Besides the exceptions sin and
memâ noted above, all adjectival modifiers must follow the noun. Thus, one
finds: tíl=e sm=e and tíl sm=e ‘a/the big dog’ but not *sm=e tíl=e or *sm
tíl=e, neither with the same intended meaning nor any other meaning.
Second, and more importantly, nouns are lexically specified for one
gender. The only exceptions are a few nouns which commonly undergo crossclassification, i.e. pick their gender according to the sex of the referent (see
4.3). Adjectives, on the other hand, are not specified for gender. Although
adjectival modifiers do not have any inflectional markers which agree in
gender with the noun, any article or other determiner following the adjective
always does. In case of a headless adjective, as in (81) above, agreement
patterns in the determiner follow the gender of the noun normally used to refer
to a given referent.","[141, 142, 143, 144]"

"Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):

Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.",[416]
"In the rest of this section on generic terms I discuss a few peculiarities of the
classificatory construction.
First, generic term and referential noun obligatorily or preferably occur in
reverse order in a few cases:

‘scorpion species’In order to refer to a metallic starling, one says taan wan. To just say *taan is
out of the question. The generic term cannot be left out, which suggests that
examples like taan wan form a very close compound-like structure.",[248]

‘rotten (of meat)’, tol ‘hot, spicy, strong taste; aggressive’, yam ‘ripe’, yang
‘sharp’, yangyang ‘thorny’.
Human propensity: dleb ‘sullen, irritable’, gaang ‘wise’ (but see below).
Similarity: afet ‘different’, mak ‘certain, (an)other’.
Difficulty: bumlók ‘difficult’, kufiab ‘easy’.
Qualification: afan ‘wrong, odd, strange’, afét ‘cleared of taboo’, awém
‘taboo’, ayók ‘secret’, báin ‘true’, dam ‘true’, keim ‘clear, obvious’, kweital
‘correct’, moton ‘true’.
Order: mikiktêm ‘first’, mubiang ‘last’.
The assignment of dleb ‘sullen, irritable’, gaang ‘wise’ to the class of
adjectives is tentative because these two items are not well attested in the
corpus. Collocations like naka gaang ‘wise man’ and naka dleb ‘sullen man’
have head-modifier order and suggest that these two items are indeed
adjectives. Other concepts relating to human propensity, such as ‘hungry’,
‘angry’, ‘envious’, ‘happy’, ‘ashamed’ are expressed using (complex) verbs.
Mian does not conform to the typological tendency noted by Dixon (2004:
4) that speed terms are in the adjective class if terms relating to physical
property are also in the adjective class. The two speed terms hebmamsâb ‘fast’
and fiab ‘slow’ are in the class of adverbs, whereas physical property terms
are adjectives.
Suprasegmentally, adjectives – like nouns – are lexically specified for one
accent and one out of four tonal melodies (i.e. L, H, LH, and LHL). The HL
melody is unattested in adjectives. Adjectives function as modifiers of nouns
in noun phrases but can also be used as the only constituent of a headless noun
phrase and as the predicate in non-verbal clauses. As modifiers, adjectives
always follow the noun they modify with the notable exception of sin ‘old’
and memâ ‘new’, which can (and tend to) occur before the noun.","[140, 141]"
"1103. Word classes and grammatical relationsArticles are enclitics which also indicates the number of the noun phrase and,
in the singular, the gender of the noun. Articles are usually toneless (see
below) and receive their tonal specification from the host they encliticize to.
The forms of the article are given in table 3.2.
Table 3.2. The pronominal article
Gender
Agreement patterns

Plural

Feminine

Neuter 1

Neuter 2
=oExample
naka ‘man’
unáng ‘woman’
imen ‘taro’
am ‘house’The animate plural article =i is realized as =ei if it cliticizes to a word ending
in a high vowel /i/ or /u/. The following examples may suffice: /Hsnabi/
‘crocodile’ and /Hsnabi=i/ ‘(the) crocodiles’; /Lumasou/ ‘fish species’ and
/umasou=i/ ‘(the) umasou fish’, but /naka=i/ ‘(the) men’ not */naka=i/.
Consider example (60) where three nouns – each with a pronominal article
– appear as subject, object, and possessor:
(60)nakamîn=e
man=SG.Mimen=o
taro=PL.N1éil=e
pig=SG.Mwen-ha-b-e=a
eat.IPFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
‘While a pig was eating a man’s taro, the man…’ [Pig story]
The formatives under discussion are articles rather than overt number/gender
markers because they also indicate referentiality. The noun without the article
occurs in contexts in which the noun is used non-referentially, that is in any of
the following contexts:
--in the citation form, e.g. nakamîn ‘man, brother’, éil ‘pig’, imen ‘taro’,
sók ‘rain’, kukub ‘way, custom’.
in generic object arguments in the citation form of (some) transitive
verbs, e.g. as hakalin [wood break.IPFV.VN] ‘(activity of) breaking
wood’
in first elements in N-N compounds, e.g. wan-am [bird-house] ‘bird
blind’
in generic terms used to classify animals and plants, e.g. wan ‘bird’ in
wan tolim [bird eagle] ‘New Guinea eagle (sc. Harpyopsis
novaeguineae)’3.3. Articles-111in non-verbal predications about identity, e.g. tíl=o=be
[dog=PRD=DECL] ‘it’s a dog’
under negation, e.g. imen bl-im [taro exist-NEG] ‘there’s no taro’,
yi=ba=be [wound=NEG=DECL] ‘it’s not a wound’This suggests that the article does not behave like overt gender or noun class
markers in many Australian or Bantu languages, in which a noun either
invariably has a certain marker or invariably lacks it, but rather functions as an
article marking the noun as definite-referential or indefinite-referential but is
left out if the noun is used non-referentially. However, there is a tendency to
leave out the article if the noun is inanimate even if it is used referentially.
Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the
article to agree in gender with its noun. There is evidence that the article is on
the way of becoming a purely classificatory gender marker through the
extension of the form with article to non-referential contexts. Although the
form without article is the preferred choice under negation, as in
as bl-im [wood exist-NEG] ‘there’s no wood’, one also finds as=e bl-im
[wood=ARTICLE exist-NEG] with the same meaning. Greenberg (1978) shows
that across languages the definite article often winds up as a gender marker on
the noun after going through a grammaticalization process during which it is
increasingly used both as a definite article, meaning ‘the N’, and an indefinite
specific article, meaning ‘a specific N’ or ‘a certain N’. When the use of the
article becomes a function of the syntactic construction in which the noun
appears (e.g. negation), the original contrast between the form with article and
the form without article is lost and the distinction becomes redundant. At this
point the form with article usually starts to spread to all contexts. If this form
becomes universal in the language, the former article has become a gender
marker on the noun (Greenberg 1978: 63).
Articles can follow all nouns, i.e. common nouns, proper names, dyads,
and temporal and verbal nouns (see section 3.1). Articles can also follow finite
verbs in head-internal relative clauses and adverbial clauses. In head-internal
relative clauses (61), the article agrees in number and gender with the noun. In
adverbials (62), the article is invariably =o. Square brackets indicate clause
boundaries:

[Dimosson]
Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses are discussed in 13.2 and
13.3 under embedding.
Articles can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and follow the noun
and any adjectival modifiers. They can also follow numerals (see 6.3 for
details on modified and quantified noun phrases):
(63)tíl=e
milil=e
black=SG.M
dog=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’sm=e
big=SG.MIn (63), referentiality, number and gender are marked per article =e on the
noun and on each adjectival modifier. More common in natural discourse,
however, is to have only one article for the whole noun phrase, namely
following the rightmost modifier, for example:
(64)tíl
milil
sm=e
dog black
big=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’I analyse the article as a clitic rather than a suffix for the following reasons:
(a) Apart from nouns, articles can attach to adjectives and numerals and also
to verbs in adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses. (b) The
coordinating clitic =a (presumably a shortened form of eka ‘and’) usually
intervenes between the noun and the article in the last constituent of a
sequence of coordinate noun phrases:
(65)naka=i=a
unáng=a=i
woman=and=PL.AN
man=PL.AN=and
‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson]Articles are segmentally identical to the third person forms of the free
pronouns series, from which they are probably derived. Synchronically,
however, they differ from the pronouns in their suprasegmentals. While all
free pronoun forms are lexically specified for a high tone, articles are subject3.3. Articles113to suprasegmental phonological erosion, i.e. they are on the way to becoming
toneless. As lexical tone spreads to any toneless affixes and clitics, the
phonetic pitch value of the article depends on the lexical tone specification of
the noun (see 2.8.3.2).
I assume three stages in this grammaticalization scenario. Contemporary
Mian is moving from stage (b) to stage (c):
(66)(a) naka  (lit. ‘man he’) > (b) naka= > (c) naka-e ‘a/the man’In the first stage (a), nouns were followed by a free pronoun which was
realized as a phonologically independent word. Synchronically, articles are
generally not realized as independent phonological words anymore, although
this still happens occasionally in very old speakers (over 80 years).
In the second stage (b), the article encliticizes to the noun. Concomitantly,
suprasegmental attrition sets in.
At the final stage (c), the vocalic formative will have developed into a
toneless nominal suffix.
As the article is part of the phonological nominal word (even in very
careful speech), it is clear that the language has moved beyond the first stage.
However, one finds the pronunciations [na.ka. ] and [na.ka.] ‘a/the man’. In
the former, the article has its own high tone, in the latter it is toneless and low
tone is spread from the noun to the article. Articles which retain their own
high tone (characteristic of the second stage) and ones which are toneless
(characteristic of the third stage) occur in free variation.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"
"IntroductionGrammatically marked categories such as tense, mood, polarity, illocutionary
force and the like, called operators by Foley and Van Valin (1984) and Foley
and Olsen (1985), differ in the scope they have in clause chaining structures.
The final verb is usually marked for such categories whereas the medial verbs
in the same clause chain depend on some of this information. While medial
verbs encode sequentiality or simultaneity of events and switches in subject
reference, they rely on final verbs for information on temporal location, mood,
and illocutionary force of the events denoted by the medial verbs. This is
typical for co-subordinated structures, such as clause chains (Reesink 1983,
Foley and Van Valin 1984).
In this chapter, all operators that occur in final verbs in clause chaining
constructions and the scope they have over the clause chain will be examined
in some detail. The operators are ordered according to categories:

local phenomenon that never has scope.","[497, 498]"
"2.8. Tone51The order of rule application is not arbitrary. The rules (a-c) specified under 5
must be applied in exactly that order to yield valid results, that is first all tones
in the melody must be associated, then any leftover tones are dumped on the
final syllable, finally any leftover TBUs are supplied with a tone through
spreading.","[76, 77]"
"Adjectival modifiersAll adjectives except sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’, which tend to (but do not
have to) occur prenominally, go in the postnominal adjective slot. While
postnominal modifiers are not typically associated with head-final languages,
their presence is not unusual in such languages either (Dryer 1992).
Postnominal adjectives occur in the following preferred order:
1) Colour, e.g. milil ‘black’, mokim ‘blue’, ngáamein ‘yellow’
2) Size/dimension, e.g. sm ‘big’, gwáab ‘small’, teke ‘long’, mebwêing
‘short’
3) Others, e.g. ayam ‘good’, misiam ‘bad’, beit ‘weak’, sbál ‘strong’, afet
‘different’
4) mak ‘certain, (an)other’6.3. Modified noun phrases209Deviation from this positional preference is possible, but uncommon. Mak
‘(an)other’ can only occur after all other modifiers. Adjectival modifiers are
quite rare in natural Mian discourse and restricted to two per noun phrase in
the spontaneous corpus. Speakers do allow three adjectival modifiers (not
counting mak ‘certain, (an)other’) but consider this odd and influenced by Tok
Pisin. Consider the following examples:
(17)tíl=e
milil=e
dog=SG.M black=SG.M
‘a/the black dog’(18)tíl=e
milil=e
dog=SG.M black=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’(19)?sm=e

milil=e
sm=e
big=SG.M
dog=SG.M black=SG.M
‘a/the strong, big, black dog’sbál=e
strong=SG.MIn all of the examples (17) to (19) above the article is distributed throughout
the noun phrase, i.e. referentiality, number and gender are marked per article
=e on the head noun and on each adjectival modifier. It is more common in
natural discourse to mark number and gender only once for the whole noun
phrase, namely on the rightmost modifier, for example:
(20)tíl
milil
sm=e
dog
black
big=SG.M
‘a/the big, black dog’Adjectival modifiers are normally juxtaposed but can be coordinated overtly
by means of the coordinator eka ‘and’:
(21)sob=e
sm eka tekebmín
big
and long
soap=SG.N1
‘this big and long (bar of) soap’le
DEM.PROX.SG.N1The adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ show a clear tendency to occur
immediately before the head noun without an article:
(22)sin
am=o
old
house=N2
‘an/the old house’2106. The noun phraseThe same construction is also possible with an article on the adjective: sino
amo. Moreover, I observed that sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ also occur in the
post-nominal adjective slot, thus am(o) sino is acceptable. Smith and Weston
(1974b: 52-53) point out that sin and memâ obligatorily occur before the head
noun. It seems that some 30 years on speakers are in the process of
regularizing the syntax of these two adjectives.","[234, 235, 236]"
"8.6.7.2. Habitual forms
Verbs inflected with -b ‘Imperfective’ can have a (present) habitual
interpretation apart from the more basic continuous meaning (see 8.6.1.4).
However, there is also a dedicated habitual construction involving the
auxiliary habitual stem of the existential verb bina. As one would expect, the
habitual auxiliary cannot be collocated with perfective stems. Habitual verb
forms are always further suffixed by -b ‘Imperfective’.

Habitual verb form with bina are often collocated with the adverbs sún(ye)
‘habitually’ and amít(ye) ‘always’.
The past habitual is formed by serializing biaana with an imperfective
stem. Again, there is obligatory further suffixation of the imperfective aspect

[Dafinau]8.6.7.3. Auxiliary-serialization with perfective stems
Some perfective stems can be serialized with an imperfective auxiliary in
order to express that the result of the action denoted by the perfective stem is
continuing after the execution of the action. Consider the perfective-only verb
stem -fû’/— ‘grab’. In (182), the result of a punctual action is described. In
(183), the focus is on the continuation of the result of the action of grabbing,
i.e. holding:
(182) a-fû’-n-e=be

‘He has been holding it.’ (lit. ‘He has grabbed it and has been
staying up to now’)
The core class of perfective stems which can be serialized with a stem of the
existential verb in the function of an auxiliary are those which show this
aspect alternation. Perfective stems which belong to the core class almost all
lack an imperfective stem:8.6. TAM morphology of final verbs(184) -â’/—

clause level. For these verbs, there is neither head-marking nor dependentmarking.
As with the other three types of transitive verb, the object noun phrase of
transitive verbs in the fourth subclass tends to be elided if referent identity is
recoverable from context or speech situation or if its identity is irrelevant. The
normal situation for any transitive verb is to occur without overt object noun
phrases in Mian discourse.
Hence, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes might seem
difficult to separate from intransitive verbs in many instances. However, there
is both a syntactic and a semantic criterion which can be used to distinguish
the two from each other.
Syntactically, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes differ
from intransitives in that they are always capable of having an overt object
noun phrase, which is still understood in case it is dropped. Intransitives can
under no circumstances have overt objects nor do they have elided but
understood objects.
Semantically, the predications made by transitives without crossreferencing object affixes can be characterized as involving a participant – in
addition to the participant encoded as subject – which undergoes or is affected
by (or effected/produced by) the action described by the verb. Even though
they might show up without an overt object noun phrase in discourse,
semantically they invariably describe two-place relations.
An alternative analysis would be to treat transitives without crossreferencing object affixes as ambitransitives, i.e. verbs which can be used
either transitively or intransitively without any overt derivation. Two types of
ambitransitives are normally distinguished in the literature. The decisive
question is “which of the transitive arguments corresponds to the intransitive
argument (Dixon 1994: 18). In the first type, intransitive S becomes transitive
A, as in ‘I am eating’ vs. ‘I am eating an apple’. In the second type,
intransitive S becomes transitive O, as in ‘the door opened’ vs. ‘I opened the
door’. Following Dixon (2002: 177), I will call these two types of
ambitransitives the “S=A type” and the “S=O type”.
The alternation illustrated in (35) and (36) could thus be due to the fact that
the verb dowôn’/wen ‘eat’ is an S=A ambitransitive in Mian. However, I have
no evidence whatsoever suggesting (36) illustrates a change in argument
structure, in other words, that the verb becomes intransitive just because the
overt object noun phrase is elided. Therefore, I will reject the S=A
ambitransitive analysis here and recognize a fourth subclass of transitive verbs
whose objects are never indexed but can be freely elided without a change in
argument structure.","[369, 370, 371]"
"Two genders: Masculine and feminine onlyGender systems are not a particularly common phenomenon in Trans New
Guinea languages and if they do occur they are usually analysed as two-class
systems with a masculine and a feminine gender (Wurm 1982: 80). The
closely related Ok language Telefol, for instance, is described by Healey
(1965a: 31-32) as having two genders (masculine and feminine).2
Furthermore, having a two-gender system is typical of the Ok languages in
general (Healey 1964a: 116).
To claim that the Mian gender system has four genders is therefore
contrary to the received opinion as to how Trans New Guinea languages, and
especially the Ok languages, classify their nominal vocabulary.
An alternative analysis with only two genders and an animate-inanimate
distinction was sketched by Foley (1986: 81). He captures the homophony in
the Mian gender agreement patterns by assigning nouns that have the e-article
to the ‘masculine’ and nouns that take the o-article to the ‘feminine’ gender.
The i-article is restricted to plural animates and shows gender syncretism.
Table 4.6 sets out the agreement patterns on the article for the two-gender
analysis.
The consequences of this analysis are (a) a fundamental difference between
animate and inanimate nouns in terms of behaviour of the categories gender
and number and (b) an intricate connection or association between gender and
number/quantity for inanimates. Animates have a gender contrast in the
singular and the plural in =i, whereas for some inanimates (the neuter 1 nouns1804. Genderin the four-gender analysis presented above) a contrast in number or quantity
is expressed by means of a contrast in gender. For all other inanimates (neuter
2 in the four-gender analysis) gender markers give no indication of number.

imen ‘taro’, am ‘house’The analysis suggested by Foley is of course based on the description of Mian
gender found in Smith and Weston (1974b). As far as the formative /o/ is
concerned, Smith and Weston only use the term ‘feminine’ for animate nouns.
They go on to say that inanimates “are classified according to size or quantity”
(Smith and Weston 1974b: 41-42), i.e. plural inanimates (or quantities) and
nouns whose referents are considered to be of large size also take /o/, e.g.
kaawa-o ‘steel axe’, imen-o ‘large taro, quantity of taro’3 (Smith and Weston
1974b: 42).
It is well-known that size can be an assignment criterion for gender (Foley
1986, Aikhenvald 2000). So it could indeed be the case that káawa ‘steel axe’
is assigned to the feminine gender because it is treated as referring to a large
object. The noun káawa would then be subject to the rule that inanimates in
Mian do not have a plural in /i/. However, contrary to Smith and Weston’s
claims I cannot confirm that this assignment strategy has any relevance for
large tokens of some types of objects that come in all shapes and sizes, like
taro tubers or string bags. My data suggests that one taro can only ever be
referred to with imen=e ‘a/the taro’ regardless of size. In order to express that
a certain taro tuber is big, a modifying adjective, e.g. sm ‘big’, has to be
used, thus imen=e sm=e ‘a/the big taro’. On the other hand, imen=o can only
mean ‘(the) taros’. Therefore, size does not seem to be a predominant
assignment criterion for inanimates in contemporary Mian.
According to Smith and Weston, the other assignment criterion for
inanimates apart from size is quantity. The gender contrast is between =e for
singular or small quantity/number and =o for plural or large quantity/number.
Although the assignment criterion “quantity” is widespread in systems of
mensural and sortal classifiers and is also attested for classificatory verbs
(Aikhenvald 2000: 293, 300), it does not figure predominantly in gender
systems. Yet, in Mian we have seen that for homogeneous substances, like4.6. Alternative analysis of the gender system181liquids, differences in the agreement pattern correlate with differences in
quantity, e.g. aai=e ‘some water’ vs. aai=o ‘much water’.
A similar example comes from the Papuan language Manambu, where
mass nouns are assigned to their gender (masculine or feminine) on the basis
of quantity (Aikhenvald 1998). Hence, it seems plausible to assume that in
Mian homogeneous substances are assigned to their gender on the basis of
quantity as well. However, for most inanimates, namely those which refer to
discrete objects, the contrast is clearly not between small and large quantities
(as Smith and Weston claim), but rather a contrast between one object and
more than one objects, in other words, a contrast in number. Thus, an
inanimate noun with =e can only refer to a single entity, e.g. imen=e ‘a/the
taro’ / *‘a small amount of taro’.4
A two-gender analysis for Mian entails that the feminine gender contains –
apart from female animates – also plural inanimates, such as imen=o ‘(the)
taros’, large quantities of substances, such as aai=o ‘much water’, and
inanimates for which there is no singular-plural distinction, such as am=o
‘(the) house(s)’ and káawa=o ‘(the) steel axe(s)’.","[205, 206, 207]"
"IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They crossreference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.",[269]
"NounsNouns are by far the largest word class in Mian. Tok Pisin or English loans are
readily accommodated into the noun vocabulary of the language. Nouns are
used to refer to objects (persons, cultural or natural objects, substances),
locations, and abstract notions which are important components of the world
inhabited by the Mianmin.",[111]
"2.8.3.1. Tone in non-verbal predications
When a noun or adjective functions as the predicate in a non-verbal
predication, the nominal stem is followed by the toneless predicator =o before
the (obligatory) illocutionary marker. The tone melody associated with the
word is spread to include the predicator. The following derivations are headed
by the underlying phonemic representation of the constituent parts of the
word, followed by the English gloss.
The simple tonal melodies L (83) and H (84) are spread from the stem to
the predicator:

LHL) attach to monosyllabic stems with a cliticized predicator, the
penultimate tone in the melody attaches to the accented syllable. The leftover
tones are then associated with any remaining TBUs within the tonal domain of
the word. The last tone in the melody is not dumped as in stems without clitics
but associates with the predicator. Derivation (85) illustrates this for LH and
(86) for the HL melody.

already been mentioned above. In order to make the tone assignment work the
segment /m/ must be allowed to bear the accent to which the last but one tone
in the melody attaches, and be a TBU on its own. The other monosyllable with
a LHL melody, the adverb /LHLkla/ ‘very, properly’, see (74) above, is only
attested in contexts in which the tonal domain is co-extensive with the stem
itself.
