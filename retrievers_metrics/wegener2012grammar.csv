although there is a tendency to have the verb complex at the end, and a restric-

caused to a large extent by the possibility to drop object NPs, and by the fixed

A peculiarity of property clauses is that, in contrast to locational clauses, the

sionally found (418).

is a preference rather than a necessity (see for example (439) below).

",77.03689575195312," Savosavo is a language with nominative-accusative alignment (featuring a
‘marked nominative’ system, see discussion in Sec. 5.2), thus subjects of transi-
tive and intransitive verbs are treated alike, and different from objects. They are
set apart by their nominative case-marking (Sec. 5.2.1), the existence of a special
set of enclitic subject pronouns (Sec. 4.5.1.2), and the fact that they, in contrast
to objects, are not cross-referenced on the verb (Sec. 6.1). Objects are not case-
marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can
be said to contain a subject and one, or at most two, objects, as well as adjuncts
of different kinds (see below).
",tensor([46.5957])," All of these elements tend to precede the verb, especially when they are rep-
resented by NPs. In particular, object NPs are always pre-verbal. The position
of subjects is more flexible, depending on what linguistic expression (NP or en-
clitic pronoun) is used. However, in a transitive clause with both subject and ob-
ject represented by NPs, the order will be SOV. Following the notation of Dixon
(1979, 1994), the structures can be described as SV/AOV, with S representing the
subject of an intransitive clause, and A and O representing the subject and the
object of a transitive clause respectively. The following list shows a schematic
structure for intransitive and transitive verbs/SVCs (represented by VC for verb
complex) with NP arguments, as well as the verb l-ame-li76 ‘to give something
to someone’, the only verb that has two objects (see Sec. 6.2.1).

",77.34652709960938," All of these elements tend to precede the verb, especially when they are rep-
resented by NPs. In particular, object NPs are always pre-verbal. The position
of subjects is more flexible, depending on what linguistic expression (NP or en-
clitic pronoun) is used. However, in a transitive clause with both subject and ob-
ject represented by NPs, the order will be SOV. Following the notation of Dixon
(1979, 1994), the structures can be described as SV/AOV, with S representing the
subject of an intransitive clause, and A and O representing the subject and the
object of a transitive clause respectively. The following list shows a schematic
structure for intransitive and transitive verbs/SVCs (represented by VC for verb
complex) with NP arguments, as well as the verb l-ame-li76 ‘to give something
to someone’, the only verb that has two objects (see Sec. 6.2.1).
",80.08606719970703,"Typological profile 7
 The basic constituent order in a verbal clause is Subject–Object–Verb when
the arguments are expressed by full noun phrases. This is, however, rather rare
and pragmatically not neutral. Very often the subjects are expressed by second-
position enclitic pronouns, which can be preceded by an object noun phrase, an
adjunct or an adverb. Nonetheless, Savosavo is a fairly typical SOV-language:
suffixing, with postpositions, modifiers usually preceding the modified and the
possessor preceding the possessed. In non-verbal clauses, the basic constituent
order is Subject–Predicate, but predicates are frequently fronted.

",tensor([46.1374])," Savosavo is a language with nominative-accusative alignment (featuring a
‘marked nominative’ system, see discussion in Sec. 5.2), thus subjects of transi-
tive and intransitive verbs are treated alike, and different from objects. They are
set apart by their nominative case-marking (Sec. 5.2.1), the existence of a special
set of enclitic subject pronouns (Sec. 4.5.1.2), and the fact that they, in contrast
to objects, are not cross-referenced on the verb (Sec. 6.1). Objects are not case-
marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can
be said to contain a subject and one, or at most two, objects, as well as adjuncts
of different kinds (see below).

back and forth between several topical referents. The more arguments there are

the numeral pa ‘one’, which can also function as an indefiniteness marker (cf.

",tensor([45.6848])," Summary and a note on basic word order
The constituent order in affirmative declarative verbal clauses is quite flexible,
although there is a tendency to have the verb complex at the end, and a restric-
tion that object NPs always have to precede the verb complex. This flexibility is
caused to a large extent by the possibility to drop object NPs, and by the fixed
position of enclitic subject pronouns. Only when all arguments are represented
by NPs is the constituent order more restricted; however, it was already men-
tioned that this is rather rare. The cognitive status of the referents influences the
choice of linguistic expression used to denote the argument referents. The initial
position is of particular importance; usually, the most relevant constituent of a
clause will be placed there.

",75.069580078125," The main word classes are nouns and verbs. Other word classes include ad-
jectives, quantifiers, pronouns, determiners, locationals, derivative markers and
postpositions. In addition to a set of free personal pronouns, there is a set of en-
clitic nominative personal pronouns that can only be used for syntactic subjects.

 Inverting the usual order of subject and predicate brings the focal part of the
 clause to the clause-initial position, similar to the verbal predicate-first con-
 struction (cf. Sec. 7.1.1.1). Another similarity is that the particle te used as
 the host for the enclitic pronouns in (410) to (411) receives its own stress,
 as does ze in the verbal predicate-first construction, which is evidence for its
 status as a free morpheme. However, in the verbal predicate-first construc-
 tion the particle ze is only introduced if the verb complex does not contain
 either ta ‘FUT’ or -a ‘SIM’.
",74.72596740722656," Savosavo is a language with a “marked nominative” case system (Dixon
1979; Haspelmath 2009), overtly marking the subjects of transitive and intransi-
tive verbs as well as some non-verbal clauses on the NP (see Sec. 7.1.2), but
leaving object NPs unmarked. The pattern of NP-marking is reversed in the
marking of core participants on the verbs: there is no subject marking, but oblig-
atory object marking for transitive and transitively used ambitransitive verbs (cf.
Sec. 4.1). A system with overt marking of subjects, while objects are unmarked,
is typologically unusual (cf. Greenberg’s Universal 38: “Where there is a case
system, the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which
includes among its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb” (Green-
berg 1966: 95)), but is found, for example, in languages from the Yuman and
Cushitic families (Dixon 1979: 77).
54. The genitive case can be seen as a ‘semantic’ case, because it is connected to the
 semantic role ‘possessor’, but in this case the semantic role ‘possessor’ is equivalent
 to the syntactic relation of being a pronoun used as an attribute. The genitive is also
 the subject case of some subordinate and nominalized clauses.
55. The main difference between enclitics and suffixes, according to how the terms are
 used in this grammar (cf. Sec. 3.1), is that suffixes only attach to members of one
 particular word class, while enclitics can attach to members of several word classes.

7.1.1.3 Summary and a note on basic word order . . .",74.50546264648438," Savosavo is a language with nominative-accusative alignment (featuring a
‘marked nominative’ system, see discussion in Sec. 5.2), thus subjects of transi-
tive and intransitive verbs are treated alike, and different from objects. They are
set apart by their nominative case-marking (Sec. 5.2.1), the existence of a special
set of enclitic subject pronouns (Sec. 4.5.1.2), and the fact that they, in contrast
to objects, are not cross-referenced on the verb (Sec. 6.1). Objects are not case-
marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can
be said to contain a subject and one, or at most two, objects, as well as adjuncts
of different kinds (see below).
",74.98573303222656," Nominal predicates can be postpositional phrases (PPs) with l-omata ‘at’
(Sec. 4.9.2), locationals (Sec. 4.7), phrases headed by two of the three derivative
markers, sua ‘ATT’ and lava ‘PROPR’ (Sec. 4.8), and locative-marked NPs or
NPs without case marking (Ch. 5). Furthermore, the nominal predicate is often
a nominalized verbal clause (NVC) derived by the nominalizing suffix -ghu (see
Sec. 7.2.1.2 and Sec. 9.6). There is no copula, the subject and the predicate are
simply juxtaposed. The primary order of constituents in non-verbal clauses is
Subject – Predicate (abbreviated as S and P, respectively); for conditions on and
extent of variation, see the discussion below.
",74.62545776367188," Summary and a note on basic word order
The constituent order in affirmative declarative verbal clauses is quite flexible,
although there is a tendency to have the verb complex at the end, and a restric-
tion that object NPs always have to precede the verb complex. This flexibility is
caused to a large extent by the possibility to drop object NPs, and by the fixed
position of enclitic subject pronouns. Only when all arguments are represented
by NPs is the constituent order more restricted; however, it was already men-
tioned that this is rather rare. The cognitive status of the referents influences the
choice of linguistic expression used to denote the argument referents. The initial
position is of particular importance; usually, the most relevant constituent of a
clause will be placed there.
",tensor([43.2017])," The main word classes are nouns and verbs. Other word classes include ad-
jectives, quantifiers, pronouns, determiners, locationals, derivative markers and
postpositions. In addition to a set of free personal pronouns, there is a set of en-
clitic nominative personal pronouns that can only be used for syntactic subjects.
",tensor([46.2488])," Whenever a determiner is used it can be preceded by the demonstrative ai
‘this’. If two determiners are present, sometimes only the first is accompanied
by the demonstrative (541), sometimes only the second (542), and sometimes
both (543).

As definiteness is obligatory for an NP containing a relative clause with -tu,
the numeral pa ‘one’, which can also function as an indefiniteness marker (cf.
Sec. 4.4.1.1), can only be interpreted as a numeral when used in an NP with a
-tu-relative clause (544).
(544)[nosavu-li-tu] lo pa pera
 2SG[GEN] tell-3SG.M.O-REL DET.SG.M one basket
 ‘the one basket you talked about’(pk mk mt 126)
The constituent order in relative clauses is SOV, as in main clauses. The subject
in relative clauses is obligatorily encoded as genitive, while all other constituents
appear as they would in an independent verbal clause.

jectives, quantifiers, pronouns, determiners, locationals, derivative markers and
postpositions. In addition to a set of free personal pronouns, there is a set of en-
clitic nominative personal pronouns that can only be used for syntactic subjects.
",tensor([42.2892])," Savosavo is a language with a “marked nominative” case system (Dixon
1979; Haspelmath 2009), overtly marking the subjects of transitive and intransi-
tive verbs as well as some non-verbal clauses on the NP (see Sec. 7.1.2), but
leaving object NPs unmarked. The pattern of NP-marking is reversed in the
marking of core participants on the verbs: there is no subject marking, but oblig-
atory object marking for transitive and transitively used ambitransitive verbs (cf.
Sec. 4.1). A system with overt marking of subjects, while objects are unmarked,
is typologically unusual (cf. Greenberg’s Universal 38: “Where there is a case
system, the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which
includes among its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb” (Green-
berg 1966: 95)), but is found, for example, in languages from the Yuman and
Cushitic families (Dixon 1979: 77).
54. The genitive case can be seen as a ‘semantic’ case, because it is connected to the
 semantic role ‘possessor’, but in this case the semantic role ‘possessor’ is equivalent
 to the syntactic relation of being a pronoun used as an attribute. The genitive is also
 the subject case of some subordinate and nominalized clauses.
55. The main difference between enclitics and suffixes, according to how the terms are
 used in this grammar (cf. Sec. 3.1), is that suffixes only attach to members of one
 particular word class, while enclitics can attach to members of several word classes.

clauses. They show that a subject noun phrase and a locational expression spec-
ifying the place can simply be juxtaposed in that order, i.e. the basic order of

just like syntactic subjects in verbal clauses (cf. Sec. 7.1.1), or it is marked by the

‘marked nominative’ system, see discussion in Sec. 5.2), thus subjects of transi-
tive and intransitive verbs are treated alike, and different from objects. They are
set apart by their nominative case-marking (Sec. 5.2.1), the existence of a special
set of enclitic subject pronouns (Sec. 4.5.1.2), and the fact that they, in contrast
to objects, are not cross-referenced on the verb (Sec. 6.1). Objects are not case-
marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can
be said to contain a subject and one, or at most two, objects, as well as adjuncts
of different kinds (see below).

",74.11247253417969," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.

There are two types of subordinate purpose clauses. The type employed in exam-
ple (619) is used when the main clause and the purpose clause have different sub-
jects; the main clause is commonly an order, as in (619), and the purpose clause
explains why the order should be executed. However, when used with verbs of
coercion, commanding, permission, desire or requesting, this type of purpose
clause expresses that which is enforced, commanded, permitted, desired or re-
quested. It is described in Section 8.2.2.5.1. The other type of purpose clause
is asyndetic and used when the subject is the same in the purpose clause and
the main clause. In addition to the same-subject restriction this construction can
only be used in the specific situation that someone came or went in order to
do something, i.e. when the predicate of the main clause is either bo ‘go’ or ba
‘come’. Information on this asyndetic type of purpose clause can be found in
Section 8.2.2.5.2.
8.2.2.5.1."," The main word classes are nouns and verbs. Other word classes include ad-
jectives, quantifiers, pronouns, determiners, locationals, derivative markers and
postpositions. In addition to a set of free personal pronouns, there is a set of en-
clitic nominative personal pronouns that can only be used for syntactic subjects.
",72.70481872558594," Nominal predicates can be postpositional phrases (PPs) with l-omata ‘at’
(Sec. 4.9.2), locationals (Sec. 4.7), phrases headed by two of the three derivative
markers, sua ‘ATT’ and lava ‘PROPR’ (Sec. 4.8), and locative-marked NPs or
NPs without case marking (Ch. 5). Furthermore, the nominal predicate is often
a nominalized verbal clause (NVC) derived by the nominalizing suffix -ghu (see
Sec. 7.2.1.2 and Sec. 9.6). There is no copula, the subject and the predicate are
simply juxtaposed. The primary order of constituents in non-verbal clauses is

On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120

The genitive NP can also be complex (708).
120. This is to say that speakers would usually judge a NVC without an overtly encoded
 subject as incomplete and ungrammatical; however, in normal discourse it does
 happen that a clause without overt subject is found, even though there are only few
 examples of this in the corpus.

Order of elements in an NP is quite strict, with little variation. The head of an

1979; Haspelmath 2009), overtly marking the subjects of transitive and intransi-
tive verbs as well as some non-verbal clauses on the NP (see Sec. 7.1.2), but
leaving object NPs unmarked. The pattern of NP-marking is reversed in the
marking of core participants on the verbs: there is no subject marking, but oblig-
atory object marking for transitive and transitively used ambitransitive verbs (cf.
Sec. 4.1). A system with overt marking of subjects, while objects are unmarked,
is typologically unusual (cf. Greenberg’s Universal 38: “Where there is a case
system, the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which
includes among its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb” (Green-
berg 1966: 95)), but is found, for example, in languages from the Yuman and
Cushitic families (Dixon 1979: 77).
54. The genitive case can be seen as a ‘semantic’ case, because it is connected to the
 semantic role ‘possessor’, but in this case the semantic role ‘possessor’ is equivalent
 to the syntactic relation of being a pronoun used as an attribute. The genitive is also
 the subject case of some subordinate and nominalized clauses.
55. The main difference between enclitics and suffixes, according to how the terms are
 used in this grammar (cf. Sec. 3.1), is that suffixes only attach to members of one
 particular word class, while enclitics can attach to members of several word classes.

 Inverting the usual order of subject and predicate brings the focal part of the
 clause to the clause-initial position, similar to the verbal predicate-first con-
 struction (cf. Sec. 7.1.1.1). Another similarity is that the particle te used as
 the host for the enclitic pronouns in (410) to (411) receives its own stress,
 as does ze in the verbal predicate-first construction, which is evidence for its
 status as a free morpheme. However, in the verbal predicate-first construc-
 tion the particle ze is only introduced if the verb complex does not contain
 either ta ‘FUT’ or -a ‘SIM’.

very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).

A peculiarity of property clauses is that, in contrast to locational clauses, the
subject is often not case-marked, even though case-marking can occur ((417),
see also (436) below) and the enclitic subject personal pronouns are also occa-
sionally found (418).

When the subject follows the predicate, it tends to receive nominative case-
marking, but the number of examples without case marking suggests that this
is a preference rather than a necessity (see for example (439) below).
"," Nominal predicates can be postpositional phrases (PPs) with l-omata ‘at’
(Sec. 4.9.2), locationals (Sec. 4.7), phrases headed by two of the three derivative
markers, sua ‘ATT’ and lava ‘PROPR’ (Sec. 4.8), and locative-marked NPs or
NPs without case marking (Ch. 5). Furthermore, the nominal predicate is often
a nominalized verbal clause (NVC) derived by the nominalizing suffix -ghu (see
Sec. 7.2.1.2 and Sec. 9.6). There is no copula, the subject and the predicate are
simply juxtaposed. The primary order of constituents in non-verbal clauses is
Subject – Predicate (abbreviated as S and P, respectively); for conditions on and
extent of variation, see the discussion below.
",71.2003402709961," Examples (389) and (390) are both elicited, reflecting the fact that it is rather
unusual in natural speech to find a transitive clause with all arguments realized
as full NPs. Full NPs are either used to introduce or re-activate referents, or
as a marked way to refer to already established referents, e.g. when switching
back and forth between several topical referents. The more arguments there are
in a clause, the less likely it is that they should all require reference by means
of a full NP. Objects that are clearly identifiable from the context are usually
dropped and thus only represented by the object agreement on the verb. This
does not influence the order of the remaining constituents, i.e. a subject NP will
still precede the verb (391).

‘marked nominative’ system, see discussion in Sec. 5.2), thus subjects of transi-
tive and intransitive verbs are treated alike, and different from objects. They are
set apart by their nominative case-marking (Sec. 5.2.1), the existence of a special
set of enclitic subject pronouns (Sec. 4.5.1.2), and the fact that they, in contrast
to objects, are not cross-referenced on the verb (Sec. 6.1). Objects are not case-
marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can
be said to contain a subject and one, or at most two, objects, as well as adjuncts
of different kinds (see below).

",73.66793060302734," As far as the relative order of affixes and clitics is concerned, the general
observation that clitics can attach to affixes, while affixes will not attach to clitics
(Zwicky 1985), is also valid for Savosavo.
Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,
Dressler 1989; Haspelmath 1996, 2002; Bauer 2004). For the purpose of this
grammar, the terms ‘derivation’ and ‘inflection’ will be used with a strong focus
on category change. Thus, a morpheme will be considered derivational if its
primary function is to change the category or subcategory of the element it occurs
with (e.g. from a verb to a noun, or from a transitive to an intransitive verb).
Such morphemes can add to or change the semantic content of the base, and
some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even
clauses. Morphology that does not induce a class change, on the other hand, will
be considered as inflectional.

Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,
Dressler 1989; Haspelmath 1996, 2002; Bauer 2004). For the purpose of this
grammar, the terms ‘derivation’ and ‘inflection’ will be used with a strong focus
on category change. Thus, a morpheme will be considered derivational if its
primary function is to change the category or subcategory of the element it occurs
with (e.g. from a verb to a noun, or from a transitive to an intransitive verb).
Such morphemes can add to or change the semantic content of the base, and
some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even
clauses. Morphology that does not induce a class change, on the other hand, will
be considered as inflectional.

Structurally, there are two ways of forming locational non-verbal clauses, differ-
ing in the order of constituents. The subject NP can precede the predicate, or it
can follow it.
",73.50054168701172," Nominal predicates can be postpositional phrases (PPs) with l-omata ‘at’
(Sec. 4.9.2), locationals (Sec. 4.7), phrases headed by two of the three derivative
markers, sua ‘ATT’ and lava ‘PROPR’ (Sec. 4.8), and locative-marked NPs or
NPs without case marking (Ch. 5). Furthermore, the nominal predicate is often
a nominalized verbal clause (NVC) derived by the nominalizing suffix -ghu (see
Sec. 7.2.1.2 and Sec. 9.6). There is no copula, the subject and the predicate are
simply juxtaposed. The primary order of constituents in non-verbal clauses is
Subject – Predicate (abbreviated as S and P, respectively); for conditions on and
extent of variation, see the discussion below.

If the subject is dropped the intonation contour of a normal declarative clause
is simply compressed; the clause-final fall is then located on the last couple of
syllables, see Figure 18. Note also that the intonation contour is not influenced
by the changed order of subject and predicate. The pitch contour of example
(455) given in Figure 18 is similar to that of non-verbal clause with subject-
predicate constituent order (cf. Sec. 2.5).
"," Examples (389) and (390) are both elicited, reflecting the fact that it is rather
unusual in natural speech to find a transitive clause with all arguments realized
as full NPs. Full NPs are either used to introduce or re-activate referents, or
as a marked way to refer to already established referents, e.g. when switching
back and forth between several topical referents. The more arguments there are
in a clause, the less likely it is that they should all require reference by means
of a full NP. Objects that are clearly identifiable from the context are usually
dropped and thus only represented by the object agreement on the verb. This
does not influence the order of the remaining constituents, i.e. a subject NP will
still precede the verb (391).

Order of elements in an NP is quite strict, with little variation. The head of an
NP can be a free personal pronoun, a possessive pronoun, a locational, a noun or

7.1.1.3 Summary and a note on basic word order . . .",tensor([41.5096])," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.

 Inverting the usual order of subject and predicate brings the focal part of the
 clause to the clause-initial position, similar to the verbal predicate-first con-
 struction (cf. Sec. 7.1.1.1). Another similarity is that the particle te used as
 the host for the enclitic pronouns in (410) to (411) receives its own stress,
 as does ze in the verbal predicate-first construction, which is evidence for its
 status as a free morpheme. However, in the verbal predicate-first construc-
 tion the particle ze is only introduced if the verb complex does not contain
 either ta ‘FUT’ or -a ‘SIM’.
",73.34996795654297,"122Chapter 5. Noun phrases
The order of modifiers preceding the head is largely predetermined. A typical
NP headed by a noun and containing different modifiers is provided in (184).
(184)[edo ngai [tei sua] uvi=gha]
 two big be.like.this ATT yam=PL
 ‘two big yam tubers of that kind (lit. being thus)’ (st cs vangazua 079)
Nouns used as modifiers of other nouns are for example sodu ‘piece’, vata ‘kind’
(185), and nouns typically denoting containers or arrangements which, by mod-
ifying the head noun, provide information on quantity or arrangement of the
referent (186, 187).

(187)[lo kabuN ita]
 DET.SG.M heap rubbish
 ‘the heap of rubbish’(jp ji mt 005)
Sua-phrases50 are the only NP constituents that can appear in different places.
They are occasionally fronted and precede the quantifier slot and sometimes also
the slot for the genitive pronoun. This is usually found when the sua-phrase is
rather long and complex (188).

The sua-phrase used as a modifier in the NP in (188) precedes both the genitive
pronoun and the numeral. The locative-marked NP cannot function directly as a
50. The attributive marker sua takes a variety of complements including verbs, a type
of non-finite clause, locative-marked NPs and postpositional phrases (cf. Sec. 4.8.1
and 8.2.1.2). A phrase headed by sua ‘ATT’ can function as a non-verbal predicate
(cf. Sec. 7.1.2.2) or as a modifier in an NP. When the complement is a non-finite
clause, the resulting sua-phrase is a type of relative clause (cf. Sec. 8.2.1.2).

has a construction so similar to the one found in Savosavo for the dual that literal
translation is possible in most cases (François (2001: 389) refers to this construc-
tion as “le duel associatif”, the ‘associative dual’). Not only is the structure itself
very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).

marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can

",72.8404769897461," Similarity in form and function suggests that the diachronic origin of -vi
could be the Proto-Oceanic transitivizing suffix *-i (cf. Lynch et al. (2002: 44),
Crowley (2002b: 34)). Similar in form, but slightly different in function, is the
causative suffix -ri in the neighboring Papuan language Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003:
170 Chapter 6. The verb complex
359ff.), which introduces a new subject while demoting the subject of the intran-
sitive verb to the object of the derived form. In contrast to Savosavo -vi, it is “by
far the most productive of the word-class changing affixes” (Terrill 2003: 360).67
 Transitive verbs in Solomon Islands Pijin have the ending -im. On some verbs
borrowed into Savosavo, this is just omitted. Kuki(-li) ‘to cook (something)’ for
example, from Pijin kuki ‘to cook’ and kukim ‘to cook something’, is an ambi-
transitive verb stem in Savosavo and shows no trace of the ending -im.68 Occa-
sionally, however, it is not lost but gets reanalyzed during borrowing into Savo-
savo. As syllables in Savosavo cannot end with a consonant, /u/ is added after
/m/. The vowel /i/ is reanalyzed as part of the verb stem, especially when it is
directly preceded by a consonant. The remaining /mu/ is not analyzed uniformly.
On some lexemes, it is also analyzed as part of the verb stem, which is then
treated as an ambitransitive verb that can occur with or without object suffixes,
e.g. batisimu(-li) ‘to be baptized, to baptize someone’, from Pijin baptaes ‘to
be baptized’ and baptaesim ‘to baptize someone’ in Pijin (Jourdan and Maebiru
2002: 14). On others, /mu/ is only found on the transitive forms. For example,
parallel to the Pijin lexemes ring ‘to make a telephone call’ and ringim ‘to give
someone a call’ (Jourdan and Maebiru 2002: 188), ringi is used in Savosavo as an
intransitive verb, with the transitive counterpart ringimu-li ‘to give him a call’.69
This can be analyzed in two different ways: In one possible analysis, ringi was
borrowed as an intransitive verb root and /mu/ was reanalyzed as a transitivizing
suffix parallel to -vi. In that case, the transitive form would have to be analyzed
as ringi-mu-li ‘make.a.call-TR-3SG.M.O’. The other possible analysis is that the
intransitive and transitive forms were borrowed separately into Savosavo, so that
there are both ringi ‘to make a call’ as an intransitive verb root and ringimu-li
‘to give someone a call’ as a transitive verb root. Neither analysis can be ruled
out at the moment, and they are in fact not incompatible. Maybe pairs like those
given above became segmentable in Savosavo after a large enough number of
them was borrowed.70
67. In both cases the similarity could also be due to chance, given the small number of
 vowels in the languages involved, although the similarity in function supports the
 hypothesis that they are diachronically connected.
68. It is possible that this lexeme was borrowed directly from English, not from Pijin.

isolated utterances, the examples in this section will be longer and consist of a
number of contiguous utterances, marking rising intonation by a comma, falling
intonation by a semicolon, and breaks by a solidus. A period marks clause-final
falling intonation followed by a break.
","Order of constituents within an NP
Order of elements in an NP is quite strict, with little variation. The head of an
NP can be a free personal pronoun, a possessive pronoun, a locational, a noun or
a nominal compound, but headless NPs are very common (cf. Sec. 5.1.1.1).
",70.25286865234375," As far as the relative order of affixes and clitics is concerned, the general
observation that clitics can attach to affixes, while affixes will not attach to clitics
(Zwicky 1985), is also valid for Savosavo.
Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,
Dressler 1989; Haspelmath 1996, 2002; Bauer 2004). For the purpose of this
grammar, the terms ‘derivation’ and ‘inflection’ will be used with a strong focus
on category change. Thus, a morpheme will be considered derivational if its
primary function is to change the category or subcategory of the element it occurs
with (e.g. from a verb to a noun, or from a transitive to an intransitive verb).
Such morphemes can add to or change the semantic content of the base, and
some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even
clauses. Morphology that does not induce a class change, on the other hand, will
be considered as inflectional.

",69.22930145263672,"NPs headed by a noun or nominal compound and headless NPs
An NP headed by a noun shows the greatest range of variation in that it can
contain all word classes and phrase types that can be used in an NP. A structural
template of such an NP headed by a noun is provided in the schema in Table 33.
The order is rather strict, with little variation. NPs with all possible constituents
are not attested in the corpus. (176) is a constructed example of a near-maximal
NP.
(176) ai lo [no-va z-au-tu]RelCl ai lome-va

ighia gnari [seghe sua]sua-Phr [kuvikuvi lame]lava-Phr popo=gha pono
three small be.full ATT.SG.M lidPROPR.PL bowl=PL only
‘only these your three small full bowls with a lid that you took’
47. Zepo-phrases have been found as the only constituent of a headless NP, but not
 directly used as modifiers. To be used attributively, a zepo-phrase has to be com-
 plement of a sua-phrase, which can then function as an adnominal modifier (see
 Sec. 4.8.3).
",tensor([37.5680])," Nominalization of a verb involves two components (cf. Malchukov 2004: 6):
decategorization and recategorization. The nominalized form is decategorized
in that it has fewer or no verbal features compared to the original verb, and it
is recategorized in that it has more or all features associated with nouns in the
language under discussion. The term ‘features’ will be used to refer to morpho-
logical and syntactic characteristics of a word form, namely the kind of:
– bound morphology it can occur with,
– dependents it can take (internal syntax), and
– syntactic functions a phrase with the word form as head can have (external
 syntax112 ).
Features relevant for nominalization are those that distinguish a verb from a
noun. The highest degree of nominalization will derive a word form with all
nominal features and no verbal features. Word forms nominalized to a lesser de-
gree will have a set of features consisting of both nominal and verbal features. A
language can have a variety of means of nominalization, which derive different
types of nominalization. It is also possible to have just one nominalization device
for constructions with different feature sets. This is the case, e.g., in Tokelauan
(Hooper 1996), and also in Savosavo. Nominalizations with -ghu ‘NMLZ’ have
different sets of verbal and nominal features depending on which context they
are used in. The features that distinguish nouns from verbs in Savosavo are listed
in Table 57.

113. One might ask whether this feature should not better be listed under ‘morphology’,
as it concerns bound morphemes. However, the case enclitics as well as the enclitic
=e ‘EMPH’ do not attach to the word form, but to the phrase headed by it, and are
thus listed under ‘external syntax’.
",69.18085479736328," Nominalization of a verb involves two components (cf. Malchukov 2004: 6):
decategorization and recategorization. The nominalized form is decategorized
in that it has fewer or no verbal features compared to the original verb, and it
is recategorized in that it has more or all features associated with nouns in the
language under discussion. The term ‘features’ will be used to refer to morpho-
logical and syntactic characteristics of a word form, namely the kind of:
– bound morphology it can occur with,
– dependents it can take (internal syntax), and
– syntactic functions a phrase with the word form as head can have (external
 syntax112 ).
Features relevant for nominalization are those that distinguish a verb from a
noun. The highest degree of nominalization will derive a word form with all
nominal features and no verbal features. Word forms nominalized to a lesser de-
gree will have a set of features consisting of both nominal and verbal features. A
language can have a variety of means of nominalization, which derive different
types of nominalization. It is also possible to have just one nominalization device
for constructions with different feature sets. This is the case, e.g., in Tokelauan
(Hooper 1996), and also in Savosavo. Nominalizations with -ghu ‘NMLZ’ have
different sets of verbal and nominal features depending on which context they
are used in. The features that distinguish nouns from verbs in Savosavo are listed
in Table 57.
",tensor([37.3971])," Inclusory constructions are also quite common in Oceanic languages (cf. Bril
2004). For example, Mwotlap, an Oceanic language spoken in North Vanuatu,
has a construction so similar to the one found in Savosavo for the dual that literal
translation is possible in most cases (François (2001: 389) refers to this construc-
tion as “le duel associatif”, the ‘associative dual’). Not only is the structure itself
very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).
",tensor([39.7290])," 3DU[GEN] already be.married-NMLZ=EMPH 3SG.M=NOM
 ‘They are/were already married.’, lit. ‘Their already marrying (is/was)
 it.’(ap aeghu 057)
In example (443), the NVC consists of the abbreviated genitive pronoun to ‘3DU’
(the full form to-va ‘3DU-GEN.M’ could be used as well, cf. Sec. 5.2.3), an
adverb, and the nominalized intransitive verb ae-ghu ‘be.married-NMLZ’. The
NVC is then marked with =e ‘EMPH’, a marker signalling discourse prominence
(see Sec. 7.2.1). Finally, this =e-marked NVC is used as the syntactic predicate
followed by an expletive pronominal subject NP in a presentational structure,
which is syntactically parallel to the structure of non-verbal property clauses (cf.
Sec. 7.1.2.2). Parallel to property clauses with fronted =e-marked predicates, the
subject can be dropped. This subject NP does not refer to any specific referent,
but is a dummy subject comparable to it in impersonal English clauses like It
rains. The constituent order is always PS, but the subject can easily be dropped:

1979; Haspelmath 2009), overtly marking the subjects of transitive and intransi-
tive verbs as well as some non-verbal clauses on the NP (see Sec. 7.1.2), but
leaving object NPs unmarked. The pattern of NP-marking is reversed in the
marking of core participants on the verbs: there is no subject marking, but oblig-
atory object marking for transitive and transitively used ambitransitive verbs (cf.
Sec. 4.1). A system with overt marking of subjects, while objects are unmarked,
is typologically unusual (cf. Greenberg’s Universal 38: “Where there is a case
system, the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which
includes among its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb” (Green-
berg 1966: 95)), but is found, for example, in languages from the Yuman and
Cushitic families (Dixon 1979: 77).
54. The genitive case can be seen as a ‘semantic’ case, because it is connected to the
 semantic role ‘possessor’, but in this case the semantic role ‘possessor’ is equivalent
 to the syntactic relation of being a pronoun used as an attribute. The genitive is also
 the subject case of some subordinate and nominalized clauses.
55. The main difference between enclitics and suffixes, according to how the terms are
 used in this grammar (cf. Sec. 3.1), is that suffixes only attach to members of one
 particular word class, while enclitics can attach to members of several word classes.

‘marked nominative’ system, see discussion in Sec. 5.2), thus subjects of transi-
tive and intransitive verbs are treated alike, and different from objects. They are
set apart by their nominative case-marking (Sec. 5.2.1), the existence of a special
set of enclitic subject pronouns (Sec. 4.5.1.2), and the fact that they, in contrast
to objects, are not cross-referenced on the verb (Sec. 6.1). Objects are not case-
marked, but cross-referenced on the verb. Thus, a verbal clause in Savosavo can
be said to contain a subject and one, or at most two, objects, as well as adjuncts
of different kinds (see below).

 Inverting the usual order of subject and predicate brings the focal part of the
 clause to the clause-initial position, similar to the verbal predicate-first con-
 struction (cf. Sec. 7.1.1.1). Another similarity is that the particle te used as
 the host for the enclitic pronouns in (410) to (411) receives its own stress,
 as does ze in the verbal predicate-first construction, which is evidence for its
 status as a free morpheme. However, in the verbal predicate-first construc-
 tion the particle ze is only introduced if the verb complex does not contain

",tensor([39.4502])," Internal structure of NVCs
On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120

The genitive NP can also be complex (708).
120. This is to say that speakers would usually judge a NVC without an overtly encoded
 subject as incomplete and ungrammatical; however, in normal discourse it does
 happen that a clause without overt subject is found, even though there are only few
 examples of this in the corpus.
",72.82308959960938," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.
",72.48211669921875," Three types of focus can be distinguished:
 – Predicate-focus (answers a question like What did John do with the cookie?)
 – Argument-focus (answers a question like Who ate the cookie?)
 – Sentence-focus (answers a question like What happened?)
The emphasizing enclitic =e, as well as the emphasizing particle te mentioned
above in Section 7.1.2.1 and discussed in more detail in Section 7.2.2 below,
cannot be uniquely assigned to one of these information structural categories. It
is often possible to make perfectly grammatical utterances without any of them,
indicating topical and/or focal constituents by means of intonation and/or word
order, as in many other languages. When they are used they are found on both

possible to discuss issues of information structure and pragmatics on the basis of
isolated utterances, the examples in this section will be longer and consist of a
number of contiguous utterances, marking rising intonation by a comma, falling
intonation by a semicolon, and breaks by a solidus. A period marks clause-final
falling intonation followed by a break.

On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120

120. This is to say that speakers would usually judge a NVC without an overtly encoded
 subject as incomplete and ungrammatical; however, in normal discourse it does
 happen that a clause without overt subject is found, even though there are only few
 examples of this in the corpus.

(185), and nouns typically denoting containers or arrangements which, by mod-
ifying the head noun, provide information on quantity or arrangement of the
referent (186, 187).

Sua-phrases50 are the only NP constituents that can appear in different places.
They are occasionally fronted and precede the quantifier slot and sometimes also
the slot for the genitive pronoun. This is usually found when the sua-phrase is
rather long and complex (188).

 of a different tribe’ (ap custom 015)
The sua-phrase used as a modifier in the NP in (188) precedes both the genitive
pronoun and the numeral. The locative-marked NP cannot function directly as a
50. The attributive marker sua takes a variety of complements including verbs, a type
of non-finite clause, locative-marked NPs and postpositional phrases (cf. Sec. 4.8.1
and 8.2.1.2). A phrase headed by sua ‘ATT’ can function as a non-verbal predicate
(cf. Sec. 7.1.2.2) or as a modifier in an NP. When the complement is a non-finite
clause, the resulting sua-phrase is a type of relative clause (cf. Sec. 8.2.1.2).
",69.25306701660156," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.
",69.82572937011719," Whenever a determiner is used it can be preceded by the demonstrative ai
‘this’. If two determiners are present, sometimes only the first is accompanied
by the demonstrative (541), sometimes only the second (542), and sometimes
both (543).

Although the order of pronominal and non-pronominal NP is fixed, and although
the non-pronominal NP provides an additional characterization of the referent(s)
just as modifiers within an NP would, there is no structural evidence that one of
the two NPs in an appositional construction should be analyzed as the head of
the construction.
5.3.3.",tensor([38.9502])," Nominal predicates can be postpositional phrases (PPs) with l-omata ‘at’
(Sec. 4.9.2), locationals (Sec. 4.7), phrases headed by two of the three derivative
markers, sua ‘ATT’ and lava ‘PROPR’ (Sec. 4.8), and locative-marked NPs or
NPs without case marking (Ch. 5). Furthermore, the nominal predicate is often
a nominalized verbal clause (NVC) derived by the nominalizing suffix -ghu (see
Sec. 7.2.1.2 and Sec. 9.6). There is no copula, the subject and the predicate are
simply juxtaposed. The primary order of constituents in non-verbal clauses is
Subject – Predicate (abbreviated as S and P, respectively); for conditions on and
extent of variation, see the discussion below.
",72.63749694824219," 3DU[GEN] already be.married-NMLZ=EMPH 3SG.M=NOM
 ‘They are/were already married.’, lit. ‘Their already marrying (is/was)
 it.’(ap aeghu 057)
In example (443), the NVC consists of the abbreviated genitive pronoun to ‘3DU’
(the full form to-va ‘3DU-GEN.M’ could be used as well, cf. Sec. 5.2.3), an
adverb, and the nominalized intransitive verb ae-ghu ‘be.married-NMLZ’. The
NVC is then marked with =e ‘EMPH’, a marker signalling discourse prominence
(see Sec. 7.2.1). Finally, this =e-marked NVC is used as the syntactic predicate
followed by an expletive pronominal subject NP in a presentational structure,
which is syntactically parallel to the structure of non-verbal property clauses (cf.
Sec. 7.1.2.2). Parallel to property clauses with fronted =e-marked predicates, the
subject can be dropped. This subject NP does not refer to any specific referent,
but is a dummy subject comparable to it in impersonal English clauses like It
rains. The constituent order is always PS, but the subject can easily be dropped:

(Zwicky 1985), is also valid for Savosavo.
Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,
Dressler 1989; Haspelmath 1996, 2002; Bauer 2004). For the purpose of this
grammar, the terms ‘derivation’ and ‘inflection’ will be used with a strong focus
on category change. Thus, a morpheme will be considered derivational if its
primary function is to change the category or subcategory of the element it occurs
with (e.g. from a verb to a noun, or from a transitive to an intransitive verb).
Such morphemes can add to or change the semantic content of the base, and
some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even
clauses. Morphology that does not induce a class change, on the other hand, will
be considered as inflectional.

 Inverting the usual order of subject and predicate brings the focal part of the
 clause to the clause-initial position, similar to the verbal predicate-first con-
 struction (cf. Sec. 7.1.1.1). Another similarity is that the particle te used as
 the host for the enclitic pronouns in (410) to (411) receives its own stress,
 as does ze in the verbal predicate-first construction, which is evidence for its
 status as a free morpheme. However, in the verbal predicate-first construc-
 tion the particle ze is only introduced if the verb complex does not contain
 either ta ‘FUT’ or -a ‘SIM’.

",72.14128112792969," Inclusory constructions are also quite common in Oceanic languages (cf. Bril
2004). For example, Mwotlap, an Oceanic language spoken in North Vanuatu,
has a construction so similar to the one found in Savosavo for the dual that literal
translation is possible in most cases (François (2001: 389) refers to this construc-
tion as “le duel associatif”, the ‘associative dual’). Not only is the structure itself
very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).

"," Internal structure of NVCs
On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120
(707)Tulola [ze-vazaba-ghu]=elo=na.
 then 3PL-GEN.M become.visible-NMLZ=EMPH 3SG.M=NOM
 ‘And then they went home.’, lit. ‘And then their becoming visible (was)
 it.’(ap kukui 045)
The genitive NP can also be complex (708).
120. This is to say that speakers would usually judge a NVC without an overtly encoded
 subject as incomplete and ungrammatical; however, in normal discourse it does
 happen that a clause without overt subject is found, even though there are only few
 examples of this in the corpus.
",68.91510009765625," 3DU[GEN] already be.married-NMLZ=EMPH 3SG.M=NOM
 ‘They are/were already married.’, lit. ‘Their already marrying (is/was)
 it.’(ap aeghu 057)
In example (443), the NVC consists of the abbreviated genitive pronoun to ‘3DU’
(the full form to-va ‘3DU-GEN.M’ could be used as well, cf. Sec. 5.2.3), an
adverb, and the nominalized intransitive verb ae-ghu ‘be.married-NMLZ’. The
NVC is then marked with =e ‘EMPH’, a marker signalling discourse prominence
(see Sec. 7.2.1). Finally, this =e-marked NVC is used as the syntactic predicate
followed by an expletive pronominal subject NP in a presentational structure,
which is syntactically parallel to the structure of non-verbal property clauses (cf.
Sec. 7.1.2.2). Parallel to property clauses with fronted =e-marked predicates, the
subject can be dropped. This subject NP does not refer to any specific referent,
but is a dummy subject comparable to it in impersonal English clauses like It
rains. The constituent order is always PS, but the subject can easily be dropped:

",69.44657897949219,"122Chapter 5. Noun phrases
The order of modifiers preceding the head is largely predetermined. A typical
NP headed by a noun and containing different modifiers is provided in (184).

 ‘two big yam tubers of that kind (lit. being thus)’ (st cs vangazua 079)
Nouns used as modifiers of other nouns are for example sodu ‘piece’, vata ‘kind’
(185), and nouns typically denoting containers or arrangements which, by mod-
ifying the head noun, provide information on quantity or arrangement of the
referent (186, 187).

Sua-phrases50 are the only NP constituents that can appear in different places.
They are occasionally fronted and precede the quantifier slot and sometimes also
the slot for the genitive pronoun. This is usually found when the sua-phrase is
rather long and complex (188).

pronoun and the numeral. The locative-marked NP cannot function directly as a
50. The attributive marker sua takes a variety of complements including verbs, a type
of non-finite clause, locative-marked NPs and postpositional phrases (cf. Sec. 4.8.1
and 8.2.1.2). A phrase headed by sua ‘ATT’ can function as a non-verbal predicate
(cf. Sec. 7.1.2.2) or as a modifier in an NP. When the complement is a non-finite
clause, the resulting sua-phrase is a type of relative clause (cf. Sec. 8.2.1.2).

",tensor([38.5717]),"Order of constituents within an NP
Order of elements in an NP is quite strict, with little variation. The head of an
NP can be a free personal pronoun, a possessive pronoun, a locational, a noun or
a nominal compound, but headless NPs are very common (cf. Sec. 5.1.1.1).
",72.26802062988281," Nominalization of a verb involves two components (cf. Malchukov 2004: 6):
decategorization and recategorization. The nominalized form is decategorized
in that it has fewer or no verbal features compared to the original verb, and it
is recategorized in that it has more or all features associated with nouns in the
language under discussion. The term ‘features’ will be used to refer to morpho-
logical and syntactic characteristics of a word form, namely the kind of:
– bound morphology it can occur with,
– dependents it can take (internal syntax), and
– syntactic functions a phrase with the word form as head can have (external
 syntax112 ).
Features relevant for nominalization are those that distinguish a verb from a
noun. The highest degree of nominalization will derive a word form with all
nominal features and no verbal features. Word forms nominalized to a lesser de-
gree will have a set of features consisting of both nominal and verbal features. A
language can have a variety of means of nominalization, which derive different
types of nominalization. It is also possible to have just one nominalization device
for constructions with different feature sets. This is the case, e.g., in Tokelauan
(Hooper 1996), and also in Savosavo. Nominalizations with -ghu ‘NMLZ’ have
different sets of verbal and nominal features depending on which context they
are used in. The features that distinguish nouns from verbs in Savosavo are listed
in Table 57.

back and forth between several topical referents. The more arguments there are
in a clause, the less likely it is that they should all require reference by means
of a full NP. Objects that are clearly identifiable from the context are usually
dropped and thus only represented by the object agreement on the verb. This
does not influence the order of the remaining constituents, i.e. a subject NP will
still precede the verb (391).

is a preference rather than a necessity (see for example (439) below).

",68.16767120361328," Internal structure of NVCs
On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120

 ‘And then they went home.’, lit. ‘And then their becoming visible (was)

The genitive NP can also be complex (708).
120. This is to say that speakers would usually judge a NVC without an overtly encoded
 subject as incomplete and ungrammatical; however, in normal discourse it does
 happen that a clause without overt subject is found, even though there are only few
 examples of this in the corpus.
",69.24824523925781," As far as the relative order of affixes and clitics is concerned, the general
observation that clitics can attach to affixes, while affixes will not attach to clitics
(Zwicky 1985), is also valid for Savosavo.
Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,
Dressler 1989; Haspelmath 1996, 2002; Bauer 2004). For the purpose of this
grammar, the terms ‘derivation’ and ‘inflection’ will be used with a strong focus
on category change. Thus, a morpheme will be considered derivational if its
primary function is to change the category or subcategory of the element it occurs
with (e.g. from a verb to a noun, or from a transitive to an intransitive verb).
Such morphemes can add to or change the semantic content of the base, and
some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even
clauses. Morphology that does not induce a class change, on the other hand, will
be considered as inflectional.
",68.08778381347656," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.
",tensor([35.1218])," As far as the relative order of affixes and clitics is concerned, the general
observation that clitics can attach to affixes, while affixes will not attach to clitics
(Zwicky 1985), is also valid for Savosavo.
Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,

some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even

be considered as inflectional.

In example (443), the NVC consists of the abbreviated genitive pronoun to ‘3DU’
(the full form to-va ‘3DU-GEN.M’ could be used as well, cf. Sec. 5.2.3), an
adverb, and the nominalized intransitive verb ae-ghu ‘be.married-NMLZ’. The
NVC is then marked with =e ‘EMPH’, a marker signalling discourse prominence
(see Sec. 7.2.1). Finally, this =e-marked NVC is used as the syntactic predicate
followed by an expletive pronominal subject NP in a presentational structure,
which is syntactically parallel to the structure of non-verbal property clauses (cf.
Sec. 7.1.2.2). Parallel to property clauses with fronted =e-marked predicates, the
subject can be dropped. This subject NP does not refer to any specific referent,
but is a dummy subject comparable to it in impersonal English clauses like It
rains. The constituent order is always PS, but the subject can easily be dropped:

",tensor([37.1199])," Nominalization of a verb involves two components (cf. Malchukov 2004: 6):
decategorization and recategorization. The nominalized form is decategorized
in that it has fewer or no verbal features compared to the original verb, and it
is recategorized in that it has more or all features associated with nouns in the
language under discussion. The term ‘features’ will be used to refer to morpho-
logical and syntactic characteristics of a word form, namely the kind of:
– bound morphology it can occur with,
– dependents it can take (internal syntax), and
– syntactic functions a phrase with the word form as head can have (external
 syntax112 ).
Features relevant for nominalization are those that distinguish a verb from a
noun. The highest degree of nominalization will derive a word form with all
nominal features and no verbal features. Word forms nominalized to a lesser de-
gree will have a set of features consisting of both nominal and verbal features. A
language can have a variety of means of nominalization, which derive different
types of nominalization. It is also possible to have just one nominalization device
for constructions with different feature sets. This is the case, e.g., in Tokelauan
(Hooper 1996), and also in Savosavo. Nominalizations with -ghu ‘NMLZ’ have
different sets of verbal and nominal features depending on which context they
are used in. The features that distinguish nouns from verbs in Savosavo are listed
in Table 57.
",71.76604461669922," Internal structure of NVCs
On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120

just like syntactic subjects in verbal clauses (cf. Sec. 7.1.1), or it is marked by the

",68.37215423583984," Savosavo is a language with a “marked nominative” case system (Dixon
1979; Haspelmath 2009), overtly marking the subjects of transitive and intransi-
tive verbs as well as some non-verbal clauses on the NP (see Sec. 7.1.2), but
leaving object NPs unmarked. The pattern of NP-marking is reversed in the
marking of core participants on the verbs: there is no subject marking, but oblig-
atory object marking for transitive and transitively used ambitransitive verbs (cf.
Sec. 4.1). A system with overt marking of subjects, while objects are unmarked,
is typologically unusual (cf. Greenberg’s Universal 38: “Where there is a case
system, the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which
includes among its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb” (Green-
berg 1966: 95)), but is found, for example, in languages from the Yuman and
Cushitic families (Dixon 1979: 77).
54. The genitive case can be seen as a ‘semantic’ case, because it is connected to the
 semantic role ‘possessor’, but in this case the semantic role ‘possessor’ is equivalent
 to the syntactic relation of being a pronoun used as an attribute. The genitive is also
 the subject case of some subordinate and nominalized clauses.
55. The main difference between enclitics and suffixes, according to how the terms are
 used in this grammar (cf. Sec. 3.1), is that suffixes only attach to members of one
 particular word class, while enclitics can attach to members of several word classes.

","NPs headed by a noun or nominal compound and headless NPs
An NP headed by a noun shows the greatest range of variation in that it can
contain all word classes and phrase types that can be used in an NP. A structural
template of such an NP headed by a noun is provided in the schema in Table 33.
The order is rather strict, with little variation. NPs with all possible constituents
are not attested in the corpus. (176) is a constructed example of a near-maximal
NP.

A peculiarity of property clauses is that, in contrast to locational clauses, the
subject is often not case-marked, even though case-marking can occur ((417),
see also (436) below) and the enclitic subject personal pronouns are also occa-
sionally found (418).

When the subject follows the predicate, it tends to receive nominative case-
marking, but the number of examples without case marking suggests that this
is a preference rather than a necessity (see for example (439) below).

Example (354) shows that object marking affixes are already in place when the
reduplication comes in: the object marking prefix on the verb stem is redupli-
cated alongside material from the root.

 ‘[After arrival, he orders his brother to stay and prepare the food] “And I
 put (away) our things properly and make it properly.” (he) said.’
 (bd cs tonelo 115)
With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.

",71.2860336303711,"Order of constituents within an NP
Order of elements in an NP is quite strict, with little variation. The head of an
NP can be a free personal pronoun, a possessive pronoun, a locational, a noun or
a nominal compound, but headless NPs are very common (cf. Sec. 5.1.1.1).
",71.22866821289062," Nominalization of a verb involves two components (cf. Malchukov 2004: 6):
decategorization and recategorization. The nominalized form is decategorized
in that it has fewer or no verbal features compared to the original verb, and it
is recategorized in that it has more or all features associated with nouns in the
language under discussion. The term ‘features’ will be used to refer to morpho-
logical and syntactic characteristics of a word form, namely the kind of:
– bound morphology it can occur with,
– dependents it can take (internal syntax), and
– syntactic functions a phrase with the word form as head can have (external
 syntax112 ).
Features relevant for nominalization are those that distinguish a verb from a
noun. The highest degree of nominalization will derive a word form with all
nominal features and no verbal features. Word forms nominalized to a lesser de-
gree will have a set of features consisting of both nominal and verbal features. A
language can have a variety of means of nominalization, which derive different
types of nominalization. It is also possible to have just one nominalization device
for constructions with different feature sets. This is the case, e.g., in Tokelauan
(Hooper 1996), and also in Savosavo. Nominalizations with -ghu ‘NMLZ’ have
different sets of verbal and nominal features depending on which context they
are used in. The features that distinguish nouns from verbs in Savosavo are listed
in Table 57.

observation that clitics can attach to affixes, while affixes will not attach to clitics
(Zwicky 1985), is also valid for Savosavo.
Inflectional vs. derivational operations
Derivation and inflection are not binary categories, but rather form a continuum;
morphemes can be more or less derivational or inflectional (cf., for example,
Dressler 1989; Haspelmath 1996, 2002; Bauer 2004). For the purpose of this
grammar, the terms ‘derivation’ and ‘inflection’ will be used with a strong focus
on category change. Thus, a morpheme will be considered derivational if its
primary function is to change the category or subcategory of the element it occurs
with (e.g. from a verb to a noun, or from a transitive to an intransitive verb).
Such morphemes can add to or change the semantic content of the base, and
some can not only occur on individual lexemes, but also on phrases or even
clauses. Morphology that does not induce a class change, on the other hand, will
be considered as inflectional.

thus listed under ‘external syntax’.

",67.83573150634766," Finally, Kolyma Yukaghir, one of the two closely related languages consti-
tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).

",tensor([32.8537])," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.

Structurally, there are two ways of forming locational non-verbal clauses, differ-
ing in the order of constituents. The subject NP can precede the predicate, or it
can follow it.
",71.14238739013672," Finally, Kolyma Yukaghir, one of the two closely related languages consti-
tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).

Example (354) shows that object marking affixes are already in place when the
reduplication comes in: the object marking prefix on the verb stem is redupli-
cated alongside material from the root.

 ‘[After arrival, he orders his brother to stay and prepare the food] “And I
 put (away) our things properly and make it properly.” (he) said.’
 (bd cs tonelo 115)
With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.

Although the order of pronominal and non-pronominal NP is fixed, and although
the non-pronominal NP provides an additional characterization of the referent(s)
just as modifiers within an NP would, there is no structural evidence that one of
the two NPs in an appositional construction should be analyzed as the head of
the construction.

=e ‘EMPH’ do not attach to the word form, but to the phrase headed by it, and are
thus listed under ‘external syntax’.
",67.55721282958984," Postpositional phrases are used as adjuncts of a verbal clause (145–149). A
PP with l-omata ‘at’ can in addition function as the predicate in a locational
non-verbal clause ((148); cf. Sec. 7.1.2.1).
(148) [Gn-omata]PP te=lo.
1-atPA=3SG.M.NOM
‘It is (here) with me.’ (jp ji mt 240)
PPs with l-aka ‘with’ have not been found as a non-verbal predicate yet, and
PPs with l-omiti ‘for’ apparently need to be inserted in a construction with the
attributive marker sua in order to function as a non-verbal predicate (see example
(162) below).

If the subject is dropped the intonation contour of a normal declarative clause
is simply compressed; the clause-final fall is then located on the last couple of
syllables, see Figure 18. Note also that the intonation contour is not influenced
by the changed order of subject and predicate. The pitch contour of example
(455) given in Figure 18 is similar to that of non-verbal clause with subject-
predicate constituent order (cf. Sec. 2.5).

Structurally, there are two ways of forming locational non-verbal clauses, differ-
ing in the order of constituents. The subject NP can precede the predicate, or it
can follow it.

",70.18881225585938," Finally, Kolyma Yukaghir, one of the two closely related languages consti-
tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).

by the demonstrative (541), sometimes only the second (542), and sometimes
both (543).

As definiteness is obligatory for an NP containing a relative clause with -tu,
the numeral pa ‘one’, which can also function as an indefiniteness marker (cf.
Sec. 4.4.1.1), can only be interpreted as a numeral when used in an NP with a
-tu-relative clause (544).

The constituent order in relative clauses is SOV, as in main clauses. The subject
in relative clauses is obligatorily encoded as genitive, while all other constituents
appear as they would in an independent verbal clause.

",67.17609405517578,"NPs headed by a noun or nominal compound and headless NPs
An NP headed by a noun shows the greatest range of variation in that it can
contain all word classes and phrase types that can be used in an NP. A structural
template of such an NP headed by a noun is provided in the schema in Table 33.
The order is rather strict, with little variation. NPs with all possible constituents
are not attested in the corpus. (176) is a constructed example of a near-maximal
NP.

47. Zepo-phrases have been found as the only constituent of a headless NP, but not
 directly used as modifiers. To be used attributively, a zepo-phrase has to be com-
 plement of a sua-phrase, which can then function as an adnominal modifier (see
 Sec. 4.8.3).

 ‘I will hold it and tear it in pieces.’(jk mat 090)
Example (354) shows that object marking affixes are already in place when the
reduplication comes in: the object marking prefix on the verb stem is redupli-
cated alongside material from the root.
(354)“Te=gne agni=na mai-vadudurongo

 make.3SG.M do.properly-3SG.M.O say
 ‘[After arrival, he orders his brother to stay and prepare the food] “And I
 put (away) our things properly and make it properly.” (he) said.’
 (bd cs tonelo 115)
With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.

",70.1642074584961,"NPs headed by a noun or nominal compound and headless NPs
An NP headed by a noun shows the greatest range of variation in that it can
contain all word classes and phrase types that can be used in an NP. A structural
template of such an NP headed by a noun is provided in the schema in Table 33.
The order is rather strict, with little variation. NPs with all possible constituents
are not attested in the corpus. (176) is a constructed example of a near-maximal
NP.

 directly used as modifiers. To be used attributively, a zepo-phrase has to be com-
 plement of a sua-phrase, which can then function as an adnominal modifier (see
 Sec. 4.8.3).

are spoken, and Savosavo is the easternmost Papuan language of the Solomon
Islands. For a small number of languages in the Temotu Province (the east-most
2Chapter 1. The language and its speakers
Figure 1. Map of the Solomon Islands and neighboring countries
province of the Solomon Islands, see Fig. 1), there was a long-standing discus-
sion whether they should be classified as Austronesian or non-Austronesian lan-
guages (cf. Wurm 1978; Lincoln 1978; Ross 2001), but Ross and Næss have
provided convincing evidence that they are indeed Austronesian (Ross and Næss
2007). Savosavo, spoken on Savo Island in the Central Province (Fig. 2), is one
of the four languages in the central Solomon Islands that have been unequiv-
ocally classified as Papuan. The other three are Bilua (Obata 2003) and Touo
in the Western Province, and Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003) in the Central Province
(see Fig. 2). These four languages are not closely related and quite different from
each other, both in structure and in the lexicon, but have been claimed to belong
to one language family, the East Papuan family (Ross 2001; Dunn et al. 2002,
2005; Terrill 2002). A comparison of 324 lexical items across Austronesian and
Papuan languages of the Solomon Islands conducted by Tryon and Hackman
(1983) shows that while the Austronesian languages share a high percentage of
their lexicon (sometimes up to 70 or 80 %), the four Papuan languages of the
Solomon Islands have few lexical items in common. For example, Savosavo and
Lavukaleve show the highest percentage of shared vocabulary of all possible
pairings between the Papuan languages, which is only about 13.7 % (Tryon and
 Location and linguistic affiliation 3
Figure 2. Language map of the Solomon Islands; the names of the Papuan languages are

Hackman 1983: 456, 460); in contrast, Savosavo has up to 20 % shared vocabu-
lary with neighboring Austronesian languages (Tryon and Hackman 1983: 464).
But although there has been intensive contact between Savosavo and the neigh-
boring Austronesian languages for a long time, as evidenced by borrowings and
loans, it has retained very distinct grammatical features (e.g. SOV word order and
a gender system) and kept its unique character. It is unintelligible for speakers
of other languages, whether Austronesian or Papuan, and (like the other Papuan
languages in the country) has a reputation of being difficult to learn.

",67.16888427734375," Inclusory constructions are also quite common in Oceanic languages (cf. Bril
2004). For example, Mwotlap, an Oceanic language spoken in North Vanuatu,
has a construction so similar to the one found in Savosavo for the dual that literal
translation is possible in most cases (François (2001: 389) refers to this construc-
tion as “le duel associatif”, the ‘associative dual’). Not only is the structure itself
very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).
",66.38245391845703,"Subject–predicate locational clauses
Examples (406)–(409) above are all examples of subject–predicate locational
clauses. They show that a subject noun phrase and a locational expression spec-
ifying the place can simply be juxtaposed in that order, i.e. the basic order of
constituents is SP. In this case the subject NP has to be marked as nominative,
just like syntactic subjects in verbal clauses (cf. Sec. 7.1.1), or it is marked by the
emphatic enclitic =e for special emphasis ((407); for a discussion of =e ‘EMPH’,
see Sec. 7.2.1). The schematized structures of the examples given above are as
follows:

7.1.2.1.2.",65.62294006347656," Finally, Kolyma Yukaghir, one of the two closely related languages consti-
tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).
",tensor([31.8778])," Postpositional phrases are used as adjuncts of a verbal clause (145–149). A
PP with l-omata ‘at’ can in addition function as the predicate in a locational
non-verbal clause ((148); cf. Sec. 7.1.2.1).

PPs with l-aka ‘with’ have not been found as a non-verbal predicate yet, and

attributive marker sua in order to function as a non-verbal predicate (see example
(162) below).

it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).

by the demonstrative (541), sometimes only the second (542), and sometimes
both (543).

As definiteness is obligatory for an NP containing a relative clause with -tu,
the numeral pa ‘one’, which can also function as an indefiniteness marker (cf.

-tu-relative clause (544).

in relative clauses is obligatorily encoded as genitive, while all other constituents

decategorization and recategorization. The nominalized form is decategorized
in that it has fewer or no verbal features compared to the original verb, and it
is recategorized in that it has more or all features associated with nouns in the
language under discussion. The term ‘features’ will be used to refer to morpho-
logical and syntactic characteristics of a word form, namely the kind of:
– bound morphology it can occur with,
– dependents it can take (internal syntax), and
– syntactic functions a phrase with the word form as head can have (external
 syntax112 ).
Features relevant for nominalization are those that distinguish a verb from a
noun. The highest degree of nominalization will derive a word form with all
nominal features and no verbal features. Word forms nominalized to a lesser de-
gree will have a set of features consisting of both nominal and verbal features. A
language can have a variety of means of nominalization, which derive different
types of nominalization. It is also possible to have just one nominalization device
for constructions with different feature sets. This is the case, e.g., in Tokelauan
(Hooper 1996), and also in Savosavo. Nominalizations with -ghu ‘NMLZ’ have
different sets of verbal and nominal features depending on which context they
are used in. The features that distinguish nouns from verbs in Savosavo are listed
in Table 57.
"," Finally, Kolyma Yukaghir, one of the two closely related languages consti-
tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).

There are two types of subordinate purpose clauses. The type employed in exam-
ple (619) is used when the main clause and the purpose clause have different sub-
jects; the main clause is commonly an order, as in (619), and the purpose clause
explains why the order should be executed. However, when used with verbs of
coercion, commanding, permission, desire or requesting, this type of purpose
clause expresses that which is enforced, commanded, permitted, desired or re-
quested. It is described in Section 8.2.2.5.1. The other type of purpose clause
is asyndetic and used when the subject is the same in the purpose clause and
the main clause. In addition to the same-subject restriction this construction can
only be used in the specific situation that someone came or went in order to
do something, i.e. when the predicate of the main clause is either bo ‘go’ or ba
‘come’. Information on this asyndetic type of purpose clause can be found in

An NP headed by a noun shows the greatest range of variation in that it can
contain all word classes and phrase types that can be used in an NP. A structural
template of such an NP headed by a noun is provided in the schema in Table 33.
The order is rather strict, with little variation. NPs with all possible constituents
are not attested in the corpus. (176) is a constructed example of a near-maximal
NP.

 directly used as modifiers. To be used attributively, a zepo-phrase has to be com-
 plement of a sua-phrase, which can then function as an adnominal modifier (see
 Sec. 4.8.3).

",66.11618041992188," Terminology
The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.

This suffix derives intransitive verb stems from some transitive and ambitran-

1. The subject is demoted and removed, the object is promoted to subject posi-
 tion.
2. The subject is unchanged, only the object is removed.
3. Both subject and object are removed and are replaced by a subject that is a
 semantic cognate of the verb, e.g. ‘a shout’ in case of a verb ‘to shout’.

With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.

",65.62384033203125," Internal structure of NVCs
On the level of the matrix clause, a NVC is equivalent to an NP. NVCs are used
embedded in a non-verbal clause frame, with a semantically empty third person
singular masculine subject (see also the description of non-verbal clauses with
a NVC predicate, Sec. 7.1.2.3). In this clause frame, the NVC functions as the
predicate, marked with =e ‘EMPH’, and precedes the subject pronoun, which
can also be omitted:
The non-verbal clause with the NVC predicate serves to present the state of
affairs expressed in the NVC. The head of a NVC is a verb or SVC marked
with -ghu ‘NMLZ’. Word order in NVCs is rather strict SV/AOV, but the object
can be fronted for emphasis (see below). The subject of a NVC is genitive and
represented by a genitive-marked NP, minimally one personal pronoun ((707);
cf. Sec. 5.2.3). Overt mention of the subject is obligatory.120

120. This is to say that speakers would usually judge a NVC without an overtly encoded
 subject as incomplete and ungrammatical; however, in normal discourse it does
 happen that a clause without overt subject is found, even though there are only few
 examples of this in the corpus.

"," Inclusory constructions are also quite common in Oceanic languages (cf. Bril
2004). For example, Mwotlap, an Oceanic language spoken in North Vanuatu,
has a construction so similar to the one found in Savosavo for the dual that literal
translation is possible in most cases (François (2001: 389) refers to this construc-
tion as “le duel associatif”, the ‘associative dual’). Not only is the structure itself
very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).

",tensor([30.8920])," Finally, Kolyma Yukaghir, one of the two closely related languages consti-
tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).
",tensor([32.4141])," Similarity in form and function suggests that the diachronic origin of -vi
could be the Proto-Oceanic transitivizing suffix *-i (cf. Lynch et al. (2002: 44),
Crowley (2002b: 34)). Similar in form, but slightly different in function, is the
causative suffix -ri in the neighboring Papuan language Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003:
170 Chapter 6. The verb complex
359ff.), which introduces a new subject while demoting the subject of the intran-
sitive verb to the object of the derived form. In contrast to Savosavo -vi, it is “by
far the most productive of the word-class changing affixes” (Terrill 2003: 360).67
 Transitive verbs in Solomon Islands Pijin have the ending -im. On some verbs
borrowed into Savosavo, this is just omitted. Kuki(-li) ‘to cook (something)’ for
example, from Pijin kuki ‘to cook’ and kukim ‘to cook something’, is an ambi-
transitive verb stem in Savosavo and shows no trace of the ending -im.68 Occa-
sionally, however, it is not lost but gets reanalyzed during borrowing into Savo-
savo. As syllables in Savosavo cannot end with a consonant, /u/ is added after
/m/. The vowel /i/ is reanalyzed as part of the verb stem, especially when it is
directly preceded by a consonant. The remaining /mu/ is not analyzed uniformly.
On some lexemes, it is also analyzed as part of the verb stem, which is then
treated as an ambitransitive verb that can occur with or without object suffixes,
e.g. batisimu(-li) ‘to be baptized, to baptize someone’, from Pijin baptaes ‘to
be baptized’ and baptaesim ‘to baptize someone’ in Pijin (Jourdan and Maebiru
2002: 14). On others, /mu/ is only found on the transitive forms. For example,
parallel to the Pijin lexemes ring ‘to make a telephone call’ and ringim ‘to give
someone a call’ (Jourdan and Maebiru 2002: 188), ringi is used in Savosavo as an
intransitive verb, with the transitive counterpart ringimu-li ‘to give him a call’.69
This can be analyzed in two different ways: In one possible analysis, ringi was
borrowed as an intransitive verb root and /mu/ was reanalyzed as a transitivizing
suffix parallel to -vi. In that case, the transitive form would have to be analyzed
as ringi-mu-li ‘make.a.call-TR-3SG.M.O’. The other possible analysis is that the
intransitive and transitive forms were borrowed separately into Savosavo, so that
there are both ringi ‘to make a call’ as an intransitive verb root and ringimu-li
‘to give someone a call’ as a transitive verb root. Neither analysis can be ruled
out at the moment, and they are in fact not incompatible. Maybe pairs like those
given above became segmentable in Savosavo after a large enough number of
them was borrowed.70
67. In both cases the similarity could also be due to chance, given the small number of
 vowels in the languages involved, although the similarity in function supports the
 hypothesis that they are diachronically connected.
68. It is possible that this lexeme was borrowed directly from English, not from Pijin.

With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.
",68.5755386352539," The Solomon Islands are the easternmost country where Papuan languages
are spoken, and Savosavo is the easternmost Papuan language of the Solomon
Islands. For a small number of languages in the Temotu Province (the east-most

Figure 1. Map of the Solomon Islands and neighboring countries
province of the Solomon Islands, see Fig. 1), there was a long-standing discus-
sion whether they should be classified as Austronesian or non-Austronesian lan-
guages (cf. Wurm 1978; Lincoln 1978; Ross 2001), but Ross and Næss have
provided convincing evidence that they are indeed Austronesian (Ross and Næss
2007). Savosavo, spoken on Savo Island in the Central Province (Fig. 2), is one
of the four languages in the central Solomon Islands that have been unequiv-
ocally classified as Papuan. The other three are Bilua (Obata 2003) and Touo
in the Western Province, and Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003) in the Central Province
(see Fig. 2). These four languages are not closely related and quite different from
each other, both in structure and in the lexicon, but have been claimed to belong
to one language family, the East Papuan family (Ross 2001; Dunn et al. 2002,
2005; Terrill 2002). A comparison of 324 lexical items across Austronesian and
Papuan languages of the Solomon Islands conducted by Tryon and Hackman
(1983) shows that while the Austronesian languages share a high percentage of
their lexicon (sometimes up to 70 or 80 %), the four Papuan languages of the
Solomon Islands have few lexical items in common. For example, Savosavo and
Lavukaleve show the highest percentage of shared vocabulary of all possible
pairings between the Papuan languages, which is only about 13.7 % (Tryon and
 Location and linguistic affiliation 3

But although there has been intensive contact between Savosavo and the neigh-
boring Austronesian languages for a long time, as evidenced by borrowings and

With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.

There are two types of subordinate purpose clauses. The type employed in exam-
ple (619) is used when the main clause and the purpose clause have different sub-
jects; the main clause is commonly an order, as in (619), and the purpose clause
explains why the order should be executed. However, when used with verbs of
coercion, commanding, permission, desire or requesting, this type of purpose
clause expresses that which is enforced, commanded, permitted, desired or re-
quested. It is described in Section 8.2.2.5.1. The other type of purpose clause
is asyndetic and used when the subject is the same in the purpose clause and
the main clause. In addition to the same-subject restriction this construction can
only be used in the specific situation that someone came or went in order to
do something, i.e. when the predicate of the main clause is either bo ‘go’ or ba
‘come’. Information on this asyndetic type of purpose clause can be found in
Section 8.2.2.5.2.
8.2.2.5.1.",63.35737228393555," Similarity in form and function suggests that the diachronic origin of -vi
could be the Proto-Oceanic transitivizing suffix *-i (cf. Lynch et al. (2002: 44),
Crowley (2002b: 34)). Similar in form, but slightly different in function, is the
causative suffix -ri in the neighboring Papuan language Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003:
170 Chapter 6. The verb complex
359ff.), which introduces a new subject while demoting the subject of the intran-
sitive verb to the object of the derived form. In contrast to Savosavo -vi, it is “by
far the most productive of the word-class changing affixes” (Terrill 2003: 360).67
 Transitive verbs in Solomon Islands Pijin have the ending -im. On some verbs
borrowed into Savosavo, this is just omitted. Kuki(-li) ‘to cook (something)’ for
example, from Pijin kuki ‘to cook’ and kukim ‘to cook something’, is an ambi-
transitive verb stem in Savosavo and shows no trace of the ending -im.68 Occa-
sionally, however, it is not lost but gets reanalyzed during borrowing into Savo-
savo. As syllables in Savosavo cannot end with a consonant, /u/ is added after
/m/. The vowel /i/ is reanalyzed as part of the verb stem, especially when it is
directly preceded by a consonant. The remaining /mu/ is not analyzed uniformly.
On some lexemes, it is also analyzed as part of the verb stem, which is then
treated as an ambitransitive verb that can occur with or without object suffixes,
e.g. batisimu(-li) ‘to be baptized, to baptize someone’, from Pijin baptaes ‘to
be baptized’ and baptaesim ‘to baptize someone’ in Pijin (Jourdan and Maebiru
2002: 14). On others, /mu/ is only found on the transitive forms. For example,
parallel to the Pijin lexemes ring ‘to make a telephone call’ and ringim ‘to give
someone a call’ (Jourdan and Maebiru 2002: 188), ringi is used in Savosavo as an
intransitive verb, with the transitive counterpart ringimu-li ‘to give him a call’.69
This can be analyzed in two different ways: In one possible analysis, ringi was
borrowed as an intransitive verb root and /mu/ was reanalyzed as a transitivizing
suffix parallel to -vi. In that case, the transitive form would have to be analyzed
as ringi-mu-li ‘make.a.call-TR-3SG.M.O’. The other possible analysis is that the
intransitive and transitive forms were borrowed separately into Savosavo, so that
there are both ringi ‘to make a call’ as an intransitive verb root and ringimu-li
‘to give someone a call’ as a transitive verb root. Neither analysis can be ruled
out at the moment, and they are in fact not incompatible. Maybe pairs like those
given above became segmentable in Savosavo after a large enough number of
them was borrowed.70
67. In both cases the similarity could also be due to chance, given the small number of
 vowels in the languages involved, although the similarity in function supports the
 hypothesis that they are diachronically connected.
68. It is possible that this lexeme was borrowed directly from English, not from Pijin.

The definitions given in the following sections summarize the features associ-
ated with a prototypical representative of the respective category in Savosavo,
mostly based on Haspelmath (2002) and in some cases additional literature cited
below. However, not all elements classified as belonging to one of the categories
will necessarily exhibit all of these features. As in many parts of grammar there
are ‘fuzzy edges’ between some of these categories, as, for example, the two
categories of affix and clitic.
Roots and stems
Roots are, at least synchronically, unanalyzable forms. Stems on the other hand
can consist of one or more roots, possibly combined with derivational morphol-
ogy.
Word
The term word is used for any free form that can be used without further mod-
ification. It may be a particle or consist of only a root, a stem, or either plus
derivational and/or inflectional affixes. One criterion for drawing word bound-
aries is that it is possible to pause between words, but normally not within. Fur-
thermore when a speech error occurs, speakers will normally start the correction
at a word boundary, not within a word. In addition words can easily be produced
in isolation.
Particles
A particle is a free, unanalyzable and invariable morpheme that usually has a
grammatical meaning. It may be restricted to certain positions within a domain
(e.g. always first in a verb complex). If it consists of more than one syllable, it
carries stress. The stress patterns of neighboring words are not influenced, and no
44Chapter 3. Word formation
morphophonemic changes are triggered by particles. Some particles can function
as host for affixes and clitics.
Affix vs. clitic
As in many languages (cf. Zwicky 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum 1983; van
Riemsdijk 1999), the distinction between affixes and clitics in Savosavo is not
clear-cut. The distinguishing criterion applied in this grammar is how particular a
morpheme is in the choice of its host. A morpheme that attaches only to members
of one particular word class is analyzed as an affix, while a morpheme that can
be attached to members of different word classes is analyzed as a clitic. This is
inversely correlated with the grade of freedom they have with respect to their
position in a clause: affixes are tied to one particular type of host, but not to
a particular position in the clause, e.g. an object affix will only ever attach to
verbs, but its position in the clause depends solely on the position of its host. In
contrast, an enclitic personal pronoun has to be placed after the first constituent
of the clause, and will attach to whatever constituent happens to precede it.

Example (354) shows that object marking affixes are already in place when the
reduplication comes in: the object marking prefix on the verb stem is redupli-
cated alongside material from the root.

 (bd cs tonelo 115)
With suffixing transitive verbs, reduplication can detransitivize the verb stem.
The subject of the resulting form will be identical to the subject of the transitive
form (in contrast to the effect of the detransitivizing suffix -za, which in some
cases leads to more complex changes in the argument structure, see Sec. 6.2.2.2).
Some examples are:
 rami-li ‘to pelt so. or sth.’ + CVCV REDUP& → rami& rami ‘to be pelting’
 eri-li ‘to push sth. or so.’ + VCV REDUP& → eri& eri ‘to be pushing’
 lusi-li ‘to squeeze sth.’ + CV REDUP& → lu& lusi ‘to be squeezing’
This detransitivizing effect is analyzed as a byproduct of the change in aktion-
sart rather than a primary function of reduplication on verbs. When a transitive
verb stem is reduplicated to change the aktionsart, adding a durative or iterative
component, the focus is on the action as such, not on the individual object(s).
However, this is not a mandatory consequence, see examples (347) and (352)
above, both featuring a reduplicated transitive verb with an object suffix.
",64.1067123413086," Thedetransitivizing suffix -za
This suffix derives intransitive verb stems from some transitive and ambitran-
sitive verb stems that index objects only by means of suffixes. It is lexically
determined what changes will occur in the argument structure of a given verb
when -za is added. There are three possibilities:
1. The subject is demoted and removed, the object is promoted to subject posi-
 tion.
2. The subject is unchanged, only the object is removed.
3. Both subject and object are removed and are replaced by a subject that is a
 semantic cognate of the verb, e.g. ‘a shout’ in case of a verb ‘to shout’.
The first pattern is the most frequent one; an example is given in (307) (transitive
in (307a) and intransitive in (307b)).

",64.4294204711914," Similarity in form and function suggests that the diachronic origin of -vi
could be the Proto-Oceanic transitivizing suffix *-i (cf. Lynch et al. (2002: 44),
Crowley (2002b: 34)). Similar in form, but slightly different in function, is the
causative suffix -ri in the neighboring Papuan language Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003:
170 Chapter 6. The verb complex
359ff.), which introduces a new subject while demoting the subject of the intran-
sitive verb to the object of the derived form. In contrast to Savosavo -vi, it is “by
far the most productive of the word-class changing affixes” (Terrill 2003: 360).67
 Transitive verbs in Solomon Islands Pijin have the ending -im. On some verbs
borrowed into Savosavo, this is just omitted. Kuki(-li) ‘to cook (something)’ for
example, from Pijin kuki ‘to cook’ and kukim ‘to cook something’, is an ambi-
transitive verb stem in Savosavo and shows no trace of the ending -im.68 Occa-
sionally, however, it is not lost but gets reanalyzed during borrowing into Savo-
savo. As syllables in Savosavo cannot end with a consonant, /u/ is added after
/m/. The vowel /i/ is reanalyzed as part of the verb stem, especially when it is
directly preceded by a consonant. The remaining /mu/ is not analyzed uniformly.
On some lexemes, it is also analyzed as part of the verb stem, which is then
treated as an ambitransitive verb that can occur with or without object suffixes,
e.g. batisimu(-li) ‘to be baptized, to baptize someone’, from Pijin baptaes ‘to
be baptized’ and baptaesim ‘to baptize someone’ in Pijin (Jourdan and Maebiru
2002: 14). On others, /mu/ is only found on the transitive forms. For example,
parallel to the Pijin lexemes ring ‘to make a telephone call’ and ringim ‘to give
someone a call’ (Jourdan and Maebiru 2002: 188), ringi is used in Savosavo as an
intransitive verb, with the transitive counterpart ringimu-li ‘to give him a call’.69
This can be analyzed in two different ways: In one possible analysis, ringi was
borrowed as an intransitive verb root and /mu/ was reanalyzed as a transitivizing
suffix parallel to -vi. In that case, the transitive form would have to be analyzed
as ringi-mu-li ‘make.a.call-TR-3SG.M.O’. The other possible analysis is that the
intransitive and transitive forms were borrowed separately into Savosavo, so that
there are both ringi ‘to make a call’ as an intransitive verb root and ringimu-li
‘to give someone a call’ as a transitive verb root. Neither analysis can be ruled
out at the moment, and they are in fact not incompatible. Maybe pairs like those
given above became segmentable in Savosavo after a large enough number of
them was borrowed.70
67. In both cases the similarity could also be due to chance, given the small number of
 vowels in the languages involved, although the similarity in function supports the
 hypothesis that they are diachronically connected.
68. It is possible that this lexeme was borrowed directly from English, not from Pijin.

guages (cf. Wurm 1978; Lincoln 1978; Ross 2001), but Ross and Næss have
provided convincing evidence that they are indeed Austronesian (Ross and Næss
2007). Savosavo, spoken on Savo Island in the Central Province (Fig. 2), is one
of the four languages in the central Solomon Islands that have been unequiv-
ocally classified as Papuan. The other three are Bilua (Obata 2003) and Touo
in the Western Province, and Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003) in the Central Province
(see Fig. 2). These four languages are not closely related and quite different from
each other, both in structure and in the lexicon, but have been claimed to belong
to one language family, the East Papuan family (Ross 2001; Dunn et al. 2002,
2005; Terrill 2002). A comparison of 324 lexical items across Austronesian and
Papuan languages of the Solomon Islands conducted by Tryon and Hackman
(1983) shows that while the Austronesian languages share a high percentage of
their lexicon (sometimes up to 70 or 80 %), the four Papuan languages of the
Solomon Islands have few lexical items in common. For example, Savosavo and
Lavukaleve show the highest percentage of shared vocabulary of all possible
pairings between the Papuan languages, which is only about 13.7 % (Tryon and

a gender system) and kept its unique character. It is unintelligible for speakers

the main clause. In addition to the same-subject restriction this construction can
only be used in the specific situation that someone came or went in order to
do something, i.e. when the predicate of the main clause is either bo ‘go’ or ba

Sua-phrases50 are the only NP constituents that can appear in different places.
They are occasionally fronted and precede the quantifier slot and sometimes also
the slot for the genitive pronoun. This is usually found when the sua-phrase is
rather long and complex (188).

The sua-phrase used as a modifier in the NP in (188) precedes both the genitive
pronoun and the numeral. The locative-marked NP cannot function directly as a
50. The attributive marker sua takes a variety of complements including verbs, a type
of non-finite clause, locative-marked NPs and postpositional phrases (cf. Sec. 4.8.1
and 8.2.1.2). A phrase headed by sua ‘ATT’ can function as a non-verbal predicate
(cf. Sec. 7.1.2.2) or as a modifier in an NP. When the complement is a non-finite
clause, the resulting sua-phrase is a type of relative clause (cf. Sec. 8.2.1.2).
"," Thedetransitivizing suffix -za
This suffix derives intransitive verb stems from some transitive and ambitran-
sitive verb stems that index objects only by means of suffixes. It is lexically
determined what changes will occur in the argument structure of a given verb
when -za is added. There are three possibilities:
1. The subject is demoted and removed, the object is promoted to subject posi-
 tion.
2. The subject is unchanged, only the object is removed.
3. Both subject and object are removed and are replaced by a subject that is a
 semantic cognate of the verb, e.g. ‘a shout’ in case of a verb ‘to shout’.
The first pattern is the most frequent one; an example is given in (307) (transitive
in (307a) and intransitive in (307b)).

There are two types of subordinate purpose clauses. The type employed in exam-
ple (619) is used when the main clause and the purpose clause have different sub-
jects; the main clause is commonly an order, as in (619), and the purpose clause
explains why the order should be executed. However, when used with verbs of
coercion, commanding, permission, desire or requesting, this type of purpose
clause expresses that which is enforced, commanded, permitted, desired or re-
quested. It is described in Section 8.2.2.5.1. The other type of purpose clause
is asyndetic and used when the subject is the same in the purpose clause and
the main clause. In addition to the same-subject restriction this construction can
only be used in the specific situation that someone came or went in order to
do something, i.e. when the predicate of the main clause is either bo ‘go’ or ba
‘come’. Information on this asyndetic type of purpose clause can be found in
Section 8.2.2.5.2.
8.2.2.5.1.",63.97622299194336," Finally, kinship terms can be used as transitive verbs, as is the case in some
other languages (cf. Evans 2000). If a kinship term is used as a verb, e.g. mama
‘mother/aunt’, it does not express that the subject is the mother or aunt of the
object referent, but rather that the subject would call the object referent ‘mama’,
i.e. has the object referent as his mother or aunt, as in example (29).

guages (cf. Wurm 1978; Lincoln 1978; Ross 2001), but Ross and Næss have
provided convincing evidence that they are indeed Austronesian (Ross and Næss
2007). Savosavo, spoken on Savo Island in the Central Province (Fig. 2), is one
of the four languages in the central Solomon Islands that have been unequiv-
ocally classified as Papuan. The other three are Bilua (Obata 2003) and Touo
in the Western Province, and Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003) in the Central Province

to one language family, the East Papuan family (Ross 2001; Dunn et al. 2002,

Papuan languages of the Solomon Islands conducted by Tryon and Hackman

their lexicon (sometimes up to 70 or 80 %), the four Papuan languages of the
Solomon Islands have few lexical items in common. For example, Savosavo and
Lavukaleve show the highest percentage of shared vocabulary of all possible
pairings between the Papuan languages, which is only about 13.7 % (Tryon and

",tensor([30.5467])," Inclusory constructions are also quite common in Oceanic languages (cf. Bril
2004). For example, Mwotlap, an Oceanic language spoken in North Vanuatu,
has a construction so similar to the one found in Savosavo for the dual that literal
translation is possible in most cases (François (2001: 389) refers to this construc-
tion as “le duel associatif”, the ‘associative dual’). Not only is the structure itself
very similar (juxtaposing an NP and a dual pronoun in that order), the pragmatic
implications associated with this construction and the typical situations where
it is used are very similar as well (François 2001: 384ff.). However, in some re-
spects the constructions in Savosavo and Mwotlap do differ. One difference is
that in Savosavo, a comitative marker is required to be used in the plural inclu-
sory construction, while this is also done by juxtaposition in Mwotlap. Further-
more, in Mwotlap, the third person dual pronoun can be used to actually coor-
dinate two NPs, and thus specify both participants (François 2001: 389), and the
order of NP – dual pronoun can be reversed to ensure that the topical participant
is mentioned first (François 2001: 390f.).
",67.9671859741211," Similarity in form and function suggests that the diachronic origin of -vi
could be the Proto-Oceanic transitivizing suffix *-i (cf. Lynch et al. (2002: 44),
Crowley (2002b: 34)). Similar in form, but slightly different in function, is the
causative suffix -ri in the neighboring Papuan language Lavukaleve (Terrill 2003:
170 Chapter 6. The verb complex
359ff.), which introduces a new subject while demoting the subject of the intran-
sitive verb to the object of the derived form. In contrast to Savosavo -vi, it is “by
far the most productive of the word-class changing affixes” (Terrill 2003: 360).67
 Transitive verbs in Solomon Islands Pijin have the ending -im. On some verbs
borrowed into Savosavo, this is just omitted. Kuki(-li) ‘to cook (something)’ for
example, from Pijin kuki ‘to cook’ and kukim ‘to cook something’, is an ambi-
transitive verb stem in Savosavo and shows no trace of the ending -im.68 Occa-
sionally, however, it is not lost but gets reanalyzed during borrowing into Savo-
savo. As syllables in Savosavo cannot end with a consonant, /u/ is added after
/m/. The vowel /i/ is reanalyzed as part of the verb stem, especially when it is
directly preceded by a consonant. The remaining /mu/ is not analyzed uniformly.
On some lexemes, it is also analyzed as part of the verb stem, which is then
treated as an ambitransitive verb that can occur with or without object suffixes,
e.g. batisimu(-li) ‘to be baptized, to baptize someone’, from Pijin baptaes ‘to
be baptized’ and baptaesim ‘to baptize someone’ in Pijin (Jourdan and Maebiru
2002: 14). On others, /mu/ is only found on the transitive forms. For example,
parallel to the Pijin lexemes ring ‘to make a telephone call’ and ringim ‘to give
someone a call’ (Jourdan and Maebiru 2002: 188), ringi is used in Savosavo as an
intransitive verb, with the transitive counterpart ringimu-li ‘to give him a call’.69
This can be analyzed in two different ways: In one possible analysis, ringi was
borrowed as an intransitive verb root and /mu/ was reanalyzed as a transitivizing
suffix parallel to -vi. In that case, the transitive form would have to be analyzed
as ringi-mu-li ‘make.a.call-TR-3SG.M.O’. The other possible analysis is that the
intransitive and transitive forms were borrowed separately into Savosavo, so that
there are both ringi ‘to make a call’ as an intransitive verb root and ringimu-li
‘to give someone a call’ as a transitive verb root. Neither analysis can be ruled
out at the moment, and they are in fact not incompatible. Maybe pairs like those
given above became segmentable in Savosavo after a large enough number of
them was borrowed.70
67. In both cases the similarity could also be due to chance, given the small number of
 vowels in the languages involved, although the similarity in function supports the
 hypothesis that they are diachronically connected.
68. It is possible that this lexeme was borrowed directly from English, not from Pijin.

tuting the Yukaghir language family spoken in northeastern Siberia, encodes per-
ception events and the perceived state of affairs in a quite similar way (Maslova
2004). As in Savosavo, there are two ways of expressing a perceived event: ei-
ther by an anaphoric pronoun or a nominalized clause in the object slot of the
verbs for ‘see’ and ‘hear’, or by a finite clause in a construction which “for-
mally resembles clause chains” (Maslova 2004: 309). Like Mian, Yukaghir has
clause-chaining constructions with switch-reference marking, and encodes the
event of perception in a dependent clause containing a different-subject marker.
The only difference from a regular clause-chaining construction in Yukaghir is
“that the object (Stimulus) slot in the Different-Subject clause is absent, and the
finite clause event must be interpreted as the Stimulus” (Maslova 2004: 309).
The functional difference between these two strategies in Yukaghir is that the
clause-chaining construction is used to introduce a new event, whereas a nomi-
nalized clause or anaphoric pronoun is used when the perceived event “has been
previously mentioned” (Maslova 2004: 309).

1. The subject is demoted and removed, the object is promoted to subject posi-
 tion.
2. The subject is unchanged, only the object is removed.
3. Both subject and object are removed and are replaced by a subject that is a
 semantic cognate of the verb, e.g. ‘a shout’ in case of a verb ‘to shout’.
The first pattern is the most frequent one; an example is given in (307) (transitive
in (307a) and intransitive in (307b)).
(307)a. [Karoti]Obj=loSubj tetozo-li(-i).

PPs with l-aka ‘with’ have not been found as a non-verbal predicate yet, and

The following text is taken from the transcript of a recording of two men play-
ing the Man & Tree game (recorded February 25, 2003), an elicitation game
developed for elicitation of spatial language by the Max Planck Institute for Psy-
cholinguistics (Pederson et al. 1998), using the picture sets no. 1 and 4. Each set
consists of twelve pictures, some of which only differ in small details such as the
orientation of the depicted objects, or their position in relation to each other. In
this session, the two participants were sitting side by side, separated by a black-
board, so that they could not see each other. Their left side was towards the sea.
Each had a set of twelve pictures spread out in front of him. One of the partici-
pants, James Pulusala (JP), described one picture at a time, in whatever order he

In example (443), the NVC consists of the abbreviated genitive pronoun to ‘3DU’
(the full form to-va ‘3DU-GEN.M’ could be used as well, cf. Sec. 5.2.3), an
adverb, and the nominalized intransitive verb ae-ghu ‘be.married-NMLZ’. The
NVC is then marked with =e ‘EMPH’, a marker signalling discourse prominence
(see Sec. 7.2.1). Finally, this =e-marked NVC is used as the syntactic predicate
followed by an expletive pronominal subject NP in a presentational structure,
which is syntactically parallel to the structure of non-verbal property clauses (cf.
Sec. 7.1.2.2). Parallel to property clauses with fronted =e-marked predicates, the
subject can be dropped. This subject NP does not refer to any specific referent,
but is a dummy subject comparable to it in impersonal English clauses like It
rains. The constituent order is always PS, but the subject can easily be dropped:
