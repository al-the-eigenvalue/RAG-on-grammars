rarely contain two overt NPs, but those that do may show AVO order, as in
 (8-45), OVA order, as in (8-46), AOV order, as in

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",72.47310638427734,"In (4-7), where 0 and IU are expressed, the Dative pronominal
 suffix has precedence over Direct 0, and occupies the Oblique !lronominal

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",68.75462341308594," Finally, there are markers of transitivity outside the verb but inside
 the clause. When an animate subject is introduced or re-introduced into
197
discourse, the last word in the subject NP hosts adnominal enclitic nene
which signals new information. This happens regardless of tense or
modality.
",69.59430694580078," BakeÂ·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.
",70.18063354492188,"Emmi operates on a subject versus object system for nominals, verbs and

affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",68.63916778564453,"Propositional enclitic particles have scope over the clause and specify tense,
status, modality, direction, polarity or evidentiality. These may attach to a
member of any word class, and are attracted to a clause-initial host. All enclitics

enclitics precede propositional enclitics.
",69.01335906982422," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.

addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.

'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

8.1.2.3 Ordering of arguments coded on the verb
 Arguments coded on the Emmi verb occupy ordered slots. This was
described in 4.1.
8.1.2.4 Arguments coded on the verb may cross-reference an overt NP
All arguments eligible for coding on the Emmi verb may cross-reference
an overt NP, e.g.

denoted by an overt NP, and be topicalised. This is, in fact, the only time an A
is denoted by an overt NP, in a narrative text of 131 clauses (119 lines).

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",tensor([34.5448])," Finally, there are markers of transitivity outside the verb but inside
 the clause. When an animate subject is introduced or re-introduced into

which signals new information. This happens regardless of tense or
modality.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",67.21232604980469," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.
",67.0154037475586,"The Benefactive suffix marks arguments beneficially affected by the
action of the verb. Within the VP, pronominal suffixes arp ordered with
respect to each other. The Benefactive suffix is ordered after the Oblique
slot and before incorporated nominals, the Adversative suffix, bound
number wordf and aspectual enclitics, e.g. (4-8) - (4-10). Ambiguity does
not arise when assigning augmented number suffixes to SIA or BEN1 when
 one is minimal and the other augmented, e.g. (4-46).

 deceased. Speakers preferred gloss (b).

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is

 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

",tensor([32.6825]),"The subs~ing of grammatical words into a longer phonological word is
pervasive in the language. Compound nouns, free pronouns, deictics, verb

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
","In addition to core arguments, peripheral argwnents ate indexd on
 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur
 a,.'ter the coverb. Like other Daly languages, Emmi indexes Adversative on
 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.

",tensor([31.0824])," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

 3MIN.S.R.come out-3MIN.MDAT meat spirit=NEW JNF=FOC
 'It's the spirit that comes out for him.' (Tl7:l 19, 137)
 As an ad.nominal enclitic, -gu differs from nene in bringing into focus
5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).
",tensor([32.2866])," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1Â·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",65.39280700683594," BakeÂ·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.
",tensor([30.6433]),"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the
 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (BÂ·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-
referential with the A of the verb, the 0 slot is filled by the Reflexive peripheral
pronominal af'.Ox, e.g. (8"" JJo).

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly

earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
"," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",64.43763732910156," BakeÂ·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.
",64.71202087402344,"In addition to core arguments, peripheral argwnents ate indexd on
 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur
 a,.'ter the coverb. Like other Daly languages, Emmi indexes Adversative on
 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.
",65.3528823852539,"The subs~ing of grammatical words into a longer phonological word is
pervasive in the language. Compound nouns, free pronouns, deictics, verb
complexes, and serial lconstructions all subsume grammatical word which then
lose phonolodcal independence; but remain stress-bearing.
",tensor([30.3279])," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes

epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",tensor([31.5651])," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

 3MIN.S.R.come out-3MIN.MDAT meat spirit=NEW JNF=FOC
 'It's the spirit that comes out for him.' (Tl7:l 19, 137)
 As an ad.nominal enclitic, -gu differs from nene in bringing into focus
5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
","Constituents of bahuvrihi compounds in Emmi are ordered like
adjectival phrases, meaning that an attributive adjective follows its referent, e.g.
rtedi kul (back bent) 'hunchback; viye wedjirr '(head bad) 'trouble-maker';

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
",65.20918273925781," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
"," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly

",tensor([30.6109])," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",67.8047866821289," BakeÂ·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated

incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

 Chapter Three
 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",tensor([27.8567])," Of the intramorphemic consonant clusters which straddle syllable
boundaries, the most common is a homorganic nasal + stop cluster, and amongst
these, the most common clusters, in order of frequency are:
/nh/dh/;
/ngg/;
/nd/;
 /mb/.
 /nydj/ is the least frequent homorganic nasal+stop cluster.
",tensor([30.2521]),"Constituents of bahuvrihi compounds in Emmi are ordered like
adjectival phrases, meaning that an attributive adjective follows its referent, e.g.
rtedi kul (back bent) 'hunchback; viye wedjirr '(head bad) 'trouble-maker';
rtedi-burrburr (back hairy) 'Hairy backed crocodile sp.'
",67.12713623046875," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).
3-53 gemi-ne awanguti=nene=~a
 3MIN.S.R.come out-3MIN.MDAT meat spirit=NEW JNF=FOC
 'It's the spirit that comes out for him.' (Tl7:l 19, 137)
 As an ad.nominal enclitic, -gu differs from nene in bringing into focus
5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

",63.52601623535156," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation
(Hamilton)
 LAB DORSLAM APIC
 < Less marked in CinitLess marked i;(Crm
 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the
tenn 'most favoured' for Hamilton's 'less marked' :
92
(ii) manner of articulation
 (Hamilton)
OBSTRGLIDE NAS LATVIB
 ~ Most favoured in Cini!
(Emmi)
OBSTRGLIDE NAS LAT VIB
Most f~oured in Cr.n >
The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

In (3-40), yene modifies the complex NP nga demi 'her side'. The
 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).
 7-73kudjala=nhdheni=yi, ngarru+kalh=m
 today=now=PERF lMIN.S.R.go somewhere+climb=PERF

Â·(e)nhdheni 'now' adds immediacy to positive imperatives, e.g. (7-74), or
exhortations, e.g. (7-75).

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)
 and (3-59) - (3-60).

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.
See Chapter Seven for details.
32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
",tensor([27.6754])," Hamilton's second most favoured cluster is [APIC] [LAM]. This
cluster is also common in Emmi, e.g. windjerre 'steal'. Hamilton's least
favoured clusters are [SON] [SON], and amongst these he sets up the
 hierarchy
 (Hamilton)
NAS+NAS LIQ+NAS LIQ+GLID ._ENAS+GLIDE
More marked
The same clusters, in the same order of frequency, are the least
favoured consonant clusters in the Emmi corpus.

 Chapter Three
 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 stress-bearing components of the Emmi verb complex. This implies that, at
 some earlier stage of the language, they were separate words which have
 since lost their phonological independence and been subsumed into the VP.
","Chapter Two describes the segmental phonology of the language. It
provides evidence for the existence of a voicing contrast between stops and the
existence of two phonemic :fricatives. It shows how the stress patterns of
complex morphemes which have been subsumed into the verb reveal that they
were once independent words.
",62.614524841308594," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

 3MIN.S.R.come out-3MIN.MDAT meat spirit=NEW JNF=FOC
 'It's the spirit that comes out for him.' (Tl7:l 19, 137)
 As an ad.nominal enclitic, -gu differs from nene in bringing into focus
5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

",63.8178596496582,"In (3-39) - (3-40), yene means 'beside'.In both utterances, yene modifies a
complex NP. In (3-39), this NP is a list of juxtaposed referents:

 'They are both sittii'lg there by her mother's side, really beside her mother.'
 (T2:12)
 114
In (3-40), yene modifies the complex NP nga demi 'her side'. The
 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.
",tensor([27.2322])," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including
addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.

 plus OL~ man that I mentioned'.
 2-65 meyidjagundinyi tjipelh+mede
two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.
",tensor([29.8668]),"Used as a propositional enclitic, -(e)no functions as a purposive marker.
Ad.nominal and propositional enclitic .. (e)no frequently occur on different words
in the same sentence, e.g. (3-25) and (3-26).
 llO
3-26awa=no ngammani=no
meat=DAT J/2MIN.S.walk=PURP
'Let's both go for meat!' (RY:2)
In (3-25) and (3-26), it is possible to construe both instano,ts of -(c)no as
the Purposive enclitic, because propositional enclitics may attach to all clause-
constituents, whereas adnominal enclitics attach only to the phrase they modify.
With either construal, the meaning of (3-25) and (3-26) remains the same,

",66.78699493408203," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation
(Hamilton)
 LAB DORSLAM APIC
 < Less marked in CinitLess marked i;(Crm
 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the
tenn 'most favoured' for Hamilton's 'less marked' :

(ii) manner of articulation
 (Hamilton)
OBSTRGLIDE NAS LATVIB
 ~ Most favoured in Cini!
(Emmi)
OBSTRGLIDE NAS LAT VIB

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.
"," Table 36 shows that propositional enclitics are ordered in relation to
each other. The directional enclitics -(e)nhdhi 'TOWARDS' and -(e)ya
'AWAY' are mutually exclusive.

48).-nene also marks new animate referents in 0 function, e.g.(3-49)- (3-51), or
in Locative case, e.g. (3-52).
",62.46978759765625,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.
\..i:u~.i\~""'1-......u.r.. ~ ~'1""""""i!. Fâ¢â¢Uâ¢)
 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
","Used as a propositional enclitic, -(e)no functions as a purposive marker.
Ad.nominal and propositional enclitic .. (e)no frequently occur on different words

 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs

(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
",60.58852005004883," 119
Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
",60.56381988525391," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
