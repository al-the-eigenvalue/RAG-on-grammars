 grammatical word may comprise several morphemes, each of which
 occupies an ordered slot. Emmi verbs frequently consist of eight ordered
 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~
 which inflects for person, number, gender and modality of SIA, and the
 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are
specified in Chapter Seven. Enclitics are ordered in relation to each other.
They may occur as part of tt~ verb complex, or enc}hcise to the final
element of a clause-initial constituent, or the final member of each clause

 morphemes, e.g. (1-6) (and see Chapter 2, section 2.3). Emmi has many
 unsegmen;table fused morphemes, e.g. the obligatory pronominal prefi~

 reflexive affix, which inflects for person, number and gender. Both are
 shown in (1-6).

 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are
specified in Chapter Seven. Enclitics are ordered in relation to each other.

 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses

simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",68.63916778564453,"Propositional enclitic particles have scope over the clause and specify tense,
status, modality, direction, polarity or evidentiality. These may attach to a
member of any word class, and are attracted to a clause-initial host. All enclitics
ma~ be copied onto every clause constituent Enclitics are ordered. Ad.nominal
enclitics precede propositional enclitics.
",69.01335906982422," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including
addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.
yuwanya+ngamen+mede ('juwapal)amenmede] \hose two men and one
 woman in the distance;
 yawanya+nemen+nganya ['jawapanemern:iapa) \hose four or more women
 plus OL~ man that I mentioned'.
 2-65 meyidjagundinyi tjipelh+mede
two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",68.13375854492188,"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.
",67.99859619140625,"In (4-7), where 0 and IU are expressed, the Dative pronominal
 suffix has precedence over Direct 0, and occupies the Oblique !lronominal
 slot. Direct 0 is expressed VP-externally by an overt NP.

contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,

 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",33.74972152709961," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.
",34.4599723815918,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",26.829614639282227,1,0.6751811138059741,"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the

peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",67.21232604980469," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as

"," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.

Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and

Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",70.17784881591797,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,

",76.19242095947266," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.
",60.82257080078125,0,0.7800751199921223,"Constituents of bahuvrihi compounds in Emmi are ordered like
adjectival phrases, meaning that an attributive adjective follows its referent, e.g.
rtedi kul (back bent) 'hunchback; viye wedjirr '(head bad) 'trouble-maker';
rtedi-burrburr (back hairy) 'Hairy backed crocodile sp.'
",63.01966857910156,1,0.8083227313241148," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of

 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two

phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect

'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary

collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial

 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never

 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

 stress-bearing components of the Emmi verb complex. This implies that, at
 some earlier stage of the language, they were separate words which have

",32.951019287109375," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:

 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",62.2299919128418,1,0.8049584622636176,"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the
 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-
referential with the A of the verb, the 0 slot is filled by the Reflexive peripheral

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses

In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
","In addition to core arguments, peripheral argwnents ate indexd on
 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur
 a,.'ter the coverb. Like other Daly languages, Emmi indexes Adversative on
 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.

 meat2MIN.A.1Rchop+burn+ 1/2BEN do
 'Roast the mea.t for us all. Do it!' (Tl 1:67)
 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
",31.117555618286133," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).
3-53 gemi-ne awanguti=nene=~a
 3MIN.S.R.come out-3MIN.MDAT meat spirit=NEW JNF=FOC
 'It's the spirit that comes out for him.' (Tl7:l 19, 137)
 As an ad.nominal enclitic, -gu differs from nene in bringing into focus
5
inanimate.entities, not possessed by spirits, e.g. malh 'language' in (3-54),
elewerre 'shady tree' in (3-55), and the Near Deictic yii in (3-56).
",32.5069465637207," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.
",69.20455932617188," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including
addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.
yuwanya+ngamen+mede ('juwapal)amenmede] \hose two men and one
 woman in the distance;
 yawanya+nemen+nganya ['jawapanemern:iapa) \hose four or more women
 plus OL~ man that I mentioned'.
 2-65 meyidjagundinyi tjipelh+mede
two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

But Emmi, while primarily a head-marking language is also dependent-

adjectives tend to be treated in a similar way to nouns,
 in languages where there is a predominant 'dependent marking'

 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive

 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",28.85051918029785,0,0.6814005498112818," But in Emmi,-nene, 'New Information' cannot accurately be described as
a transitivity marker. As a signal of new information' -nene is attached to new
agents of 'high' transitive verbs, or 'low' transitive verbs, also to subjects of
intransitive verbs, whether these are two argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'come
out [for] in (3-47) or one argument intransitive verbs, e.g. 'go somewhere' in (3-
48).-nene also marks new animate referents in 0 function, e.g.(3-49)- (3-51), or
in Locative case, e.g. (3-52).

 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)

incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",24.35751342773437,1,0.6914566540385535,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.

 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.
",28.793399810791016,1,0.6945372872740353," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics

directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A

 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns

39 NPs in core argun1ent function ..............................h ...............................",30.935773849487305," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",31.84572410583496," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.
",68.94672393798828,"In addition to core arguments, peripheral argwnents ate indexd on
 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur
 a,.'ter the coverb. Like other Daly languages, Emmi indexes Adversative on
 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.
",68.53864288330078," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including

'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.
",74.20156860351562," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.

Tokens of the fourteen enclitic types occur in 47.3% of text clauses ..
The ordering set out in this table hoMs for all enclitics except -nhdhi

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

 Chapter Eight
Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",64.36564636230469,1,0.8491959529835189," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including

you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",65.39280700683594," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

sentence, yere nimbugirriny 'your child'is also marked as new by enclitic

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
"," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",64.43763732910156," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I

 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-
referential with the A of the verb, the 0 slot is filled by the Reflexive peripheral
pronominal af'.Ox, e.g. (8"" JJo).

-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

",68.3305435180664," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",68.0289535522461," These number markers are complex morphemes and bear stress. This
suggests that, at an earlier stage of t'ie language, they may also have been
independent words, but have since lost their phonological independence, as
obligatory components of the verb complex.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",58.8475341796875,0,0.8313612998841985,"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

Syntactic constructions
 8.0 Introduction
 This chapter analyses and illustrates the syntax of Emmi clauses. In
doing so, it breaks new ground in the study of Daly languages, about which
little syntactic information has been published. Emmi clauses are either simple
or complex. Simple clauses may or may not contain a VP. Complex clauses
always contain two VPs. The first part of this chapter discusses the structure of
simple clauses. 8.1.1 deals with simple verbless clauses. 8.1.2 deals with simple
verb clauses. The rest of the chapter discusses complex clauses. 8.2.1 deals with
serial verb constructions. 8.2.i.2 focusses on causative serial constructions.
8.2.2 discusses headless relative clauses. 8.2.3 describes conjoined clauses.
8.2.4 lists free temporal, modal and locational lexemes.
8.1 Simple clauses
 Simple clauses minimally consist of a p1·edicate. In this they confom1 to
the pattern Green (1995:221) noted for Gurr-goni. In Emmi, a predicate may
consist of a member of any word class. When a verb forms the predicate, it
carries obligatory .coding for core arguments SIA and, on transitive verbs, 0.
3MIN.O is realised as zero. Only humans, higher animates and entities classed
as human in myths qualify as core arguments to be coded on the verb. Also
coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",60.92051696777344,1,0.7242197395819034,"In addition to core arguments, peripheral argwnents ate indexd on
 the Emmi verb by means of ordered bound pronominal suffixes which occur
 a,.'ter the coverb. Like other Daly languages, Emmi indexes Adversative on
 the verb. Green (1989: 1:6-127) calls the Marrithiyel equivalent the '/'anga/
 pronominal; Reid (1990:135 -139) calls the Ngan.gityemerri equivalent
 'implicated arguments', and Tryon (1970:67) calls the Marranunggu
 equivalent 'Licitive'.

 Inside the verb complex, coverbs also take secondary stress in the Daly
 region language Ngan.gityemerri. Reid (1990:100-101) produced data from en
earlier stage of the language to show that in 1931 the coverb was a separate
phonological word.

coded on the Emmi verb are the peripheral arguments Dative, Benefactive and
Adversative, in ordered peripheral VP slots.
",62.78569793701172,1,0.8521899549823295,"8.1.2.1 Core arguments
Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the

 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",60.896484375,0,0.8693615939805487,"The 1931 Ngan.gimerri data suggests that the precursor to the
contemporary Ngan.gityemerri verb structure was a phrasal verb,
consisting of a 'finite verb' and a freeform 'participle'...These two
major elements of the phrasal verb appear to have formed separate
phonological words. They could be ordered variably with respect
to one another, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto both
elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary
Ngan.gityemc~ri verb, where these two 'halves' have been
collapsed into a single phonological wor<l, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial
(rnsyllables of the auxiliary and CVS [the Emmi. coverb] respectively.
\..i:u~.i\~""'1-......u.r.. ~ ~'1""""""i!. F••U•)
 Without data from an earlier stage of Emmi, one can only hypothesise,
 but the phonological evidence suggests that the Emmi verb complex has
 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'
 Body-part nominals incorporated into the VP also give up their
 phonological independenGe. This is shown in two ways.
",59.864288330078125,1,0.7490952784199142,"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.
",22.620424270629883,0,0.7171798117624251," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.

In (3-40), yene modifies the complex NP nga demi 'her side'. The
 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
"," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the

",30.708555221557617," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",67.8047866821289," Bake·r (1988:81-83) says 'The core fact about the distribution ofNI
is that in. ordinary transitive clauses, the direct object may be incorporated
but the subject may not be.' Baker (1988:83-4) accounts for the
incorporation oflocatives by treating them as structural objects.

 possession can only be expressed by the juxtaposition of possessor

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.
See Chapter Seven for details.
32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
",72.21571350097656," I define Emmi enclitics as ordered unstressed bound morphemes
which never occur independently, but always pJ~c:.k. to a host word and
are attracted to any semantically compatible clause-initial host. Pronominal
affixes are also ordered and unstressed, but attach only to a member of the
class of stems they modify. Unlike affxes, some enditics insert an
epenthetic initial vowel when encliticising a consonant final host. Unlike
affixes, some clitics form clusters containing the clitic -(e)nhdha 'really'
which modifies just the preceding enclitic.
",58.51437377929688,1,0.8561474060139156," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

 A word may host up to four enclitics. Permissible combinations of
temporal, modal, aspectual, directional and illocutionary enclitics are

 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

It's really here he's going to go inside.' (T2:97)
In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)
 and (3-59) - (3-60).

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.
See Chapter Seven for details.
32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

way related, except as Australian languages. This contradicts Tryon (1970),
but nobody has proved that the two languages are related by reconstructing
the immediate proto-language of which they are the supposed daughters.
There are grammatical and conceptual similarities between the two
languages, which may well be the result of long..term contact, but close
examination reveals important differences in phonology, morphology,
 33
synta.'C and semantics. Lexically, Emmi and Patjtjamalh have little in
common, sharing only 12% cognates in Dixon's Comparative Australian 90
word list and 11 % in the Comparative Australian 400 word list. For a
detailed account of phonological, morphological and syntactic differences
between Emmi and Patjtjamalh, see Ford~ in press.

",63.52601623535156," Dixon's proposals were recently restated by Hamilton (1996).
Hamilton sets up the following markedness hierarchies for word-edge
consonants:
(i) place of articulation

 LAB DORSLAM APIC
 < Less marked in CinitLess marked i;(Crm
 Emmi word-edge consonants fit this hierarchy, if we substitute the

The most favoured word-final consonants in Emmi are Hamilton's
 least marked, but word-initial consonants do not fit his predictions. Emmi's
most favoured word-initial conl""onants are nasals, not obstruents, and
 vibrants are less frequent in this position than laterals, reversing the order
 Hamilton predicts.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",27.777212142944336,"In (3-39) - (3-40), yene means 'beside'.In both utterances, yene modifies a
complex NP. In (3-39), this NP is a list of juxtaposed referents:

yene errgi-nga=nhdha
LOC mother-3MIN.DAT.F=really
 'They are both sittii'lg there by her mother's side, really beside her mother.'
 (T2:12)
 114
In (3-40), yene modifies the complex NP nga demi 'her side'. The
 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.

",66.69767761230469,"Emmi operates on a subject versus object system for nominals, verbs and
bound pronouns. A, S and 0 are zero-marked on nominals but obligatorily coded
on verbs. This is a more consistently nominative/accusative system than that of
the typologically similar Dal:y: languages Marrithiyel, and Ngan' gityemerri,
 (a.~w~•·n Nqo-n""lq_~t'\)
 which have ergativ~case-mark.ing on nouns functioning as 'transitive subjects

",71.92571258544922," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.

'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",62.07320022583008,0,0.8645727520641706," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including
addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.
yuwanya+ngamen+mede ('juwapal)amenmede] \hose two men and one
 woman in the distance;
 yawanya+nemen+nganya ['jawapanemern:iapa) \hose four or more women
 plus OL~ man that I mentioned'.
 2-65 meyidjagundinyi tjipelh+mede
two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.
",63.41963958740234,0,0.9115007813446252,"Emmi operates on a subject versus object system for nominals, verbs and
bound pronouns. A, S and 0 are zero-marked on nominals but obligatorily coded
on verbs. This is a more consistently nominative/accusative system than that of
the typologically similar Dal:y: languages Marrithiyel, and Ngan' gityemerri,
 (a.~w~•·n Nqo-n""lq_~t'\)
 which have ergativ~case-mark.ing on nouns functioning as 'transitive subjects
 which are semantically or pragmatically marked.' (Green. 1989:49; Reid
 (1990:326).

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the
 test of this section, all SIA and 0 arguments are bolded; other arguments which
 may be coded on the verb are underlined.

 An additional statement is necessary in relation to the realisation of the
 0 argtiment. In 3 Minimal, 0 is realised as zero, e.g. (B·.Z..S), and contrasts with
peripheral pronominrJ affixes, all of which have overt gender-marked
realisations for 3 Minimal, e.g. (8-~) - (8-'2.~. For instance, when an 0 fa co-

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)
 and (3-59) - (3-60).

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.
See Chapter Seven for details.
32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
",27.63930320739746," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including

also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They

directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",29.8006591796875,"Used as a propositional enclitic, -(e)no functions as a purposive marker.
Ad.nominal and propositional enclitic .. (e)no frequently occur on different words

'Let's both go for meat!' (RY:2)
In (3-25) and (3-26), it is possible to construe both instano,ts of -(c)no as
the Purposive enclitic, because propositional enclitics may attach to all clause-
constituents, whereas adnominal enclitics attach only to the phrase they modify.
With either construal, the meaning of (3-25) and (3-26) remains the same,

",70.85681915283203,"Morpho-syntactically, affixes attach only to the class of stem they
 specify, but enclitics may be copied onto any or every clause constituent. For
 instance, propositional enclitics, which have scope over the whole clause, are
 often attracted to the final constituent of a clause-initial or clause-final phrase,
 whatever its word-class.
 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).

complex morphemes which have been subsumed into the verb reveal that they
were once independent words.

Enuni's core arguments are, in Dixon's 1979 teiminology, S (subject of an
 intransitive verb), A (agent ofa transitive verb), and 0 (object of a transitive
 verb). SIA and 0 are obligatorily coded on the Emmi verb, e.g. (8-20)- (8-28)
 and thus have what Foley and Van Valin (1984:98) teim ""indispensability"". I
 have used 0 indilpensability"" as a diagnostic of Emmi's core arguments. (In the

elements of the phrasal verb .. .If we accept that the 'finite verb' and
'participle' of the phrasal verb were separate phonological words,
we can further presume that each of these two words would have
borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In the contemporary

 undergone similar changes to those shown by Reid for Ngan.gityemerri. Today,
 the Enuni coverb has adapted so completely to a word-medial environment that a
 coverb-initial /g/ lenites to [V] after a preceding vowel, and /cr/, which never
 occurs word-initially, occurs as a coverb initial consonant, e.g. rri 'tell story'

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

 8.1.2.5 Cross-referencing insufficient criterion for core argument status
Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.
","Used as a propositional enclitic, -(e)no functions as a purposive marker.
Ad.nominal and propositional enclitic .. (e)no frequently occur on different words
in the same sentence, e.g. (3-25) and (3-26).
 llO
3-26awa=no ngammani=no
meat=DAT J/2MIN.S.walk=PURP
'Let's both go for meat!' (RY:2)
In (3-25) and (3-26), it is possible to construe both instano,ts of -(c)no as
the Purposive enclitic, because propositional enclitics may attach to all clause-
constituents, whereas adnominal enclitics attach only to the phrase they modify.
With either construal, the meaning of (3-25) and (3-26) remains the same,

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

Reid (1990:326) argues that -ninggi modifies 'marked' agents of transitive verbs
and subjects of 'those low transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument'
(Reid, 1990:326). He defines 'low transitive' verbs as'verbs that are formally
transitive, but are characterised by a low degree of patient affectivity'(Reid,
1990:223).
",69.15145874023438," On this evidence, it looks as though, in Emmi, -nene 'New Information'
may have originated as an Ergative marker, was then extended to introduce new
subjects of intransitive verbs, and now covers other new animate arguments.
3.2.2.8 -gu Focus marker
 Focus marker gu has an allomorph -ga which occurs after a host-final i, e
or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective

Emmi is like Warlpiri, in that Emmi nominals are marked for syntactic and
peripheral case, in Dixon's terms (Dixon: 1977:407). Unlike Warlpiri, and most
Australian languages, in which verbs and nouns operate on au Ergative
Absolutive system, but pronow1s operate on a Nominative/Accusative system
\dxon, 1980:4), Emmi nouns and free or bound pronouns inflect on a
Nominative/Accusative system which I have termed Direct.

-(e)nhdheni may co-occur with the Perfective enclitic, the Purposive
 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these

 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the

",57.00600051879883,0,0.892955088531988," Emmi has a set of fourteen enclitics which function as adnominal
enclitics, relating an NP to the rest of the clause. Most adnominal enclitics
also function as propositional enclitics, with scope over the whole clause.
Propositional enclitics may attach to a member of any word-class. They
ct:1;.zy a high functional load and are used to express modal, aspectual,
directional, and illocutionary information. While not all enclitics have
multiple functions, all enclitics are ordered with respect to each other. A
sub-set of enclitics may co-occur, some forming clitic clusters; other
enclitics are mutually exclusive. The way enclitics operate in Emmi is
described in Chapter Seven.

or a; otherwise, -gu occurs, e.g. (3-44), (3-55).
-nene 'New Information' and - gu 'Focus marker' may bod1 attach to the
same NP host, e.g. (3-54), but -gu is always preceded by -nene (for the relative
ordering of enclitics, Chapter Seven).

 3.1 Word classes
 Four word classes can be distinguished in Enuni. They are:
 nominals (nouns; adjectives; numeral quantifiers; pronouns; deictics,
interrogatives)
verbs \simple verbs, complex verbs)
adverbs
free particles (polarity particles; interjections)
 Each word class can be justified on synta~c and morphological grounds.

In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part

 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'

attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)

32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.

 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.

 All intransitive auxiliaries except nme 'rise' may occur without a

In other respects, -gu and -oeoc are very similar. Like -mme, -gu may
attach to a nominal as the subject of an intransitive verb in (3-53), the agent of a
high transitive verb in (3-57), of a low transitive verb in (3-44), as the object of
 a high transitive verb in (3-58), or the predicate of a verb-'ess clause in (3-54)
 and (3-59) - (3-60).

As a propositional enclitic -gu brings the entire clause into focus. It may
attach to any clause constituent, but is attracted to clause-initial or final constituents.
See Chapter Seven for details.
32.2.9. -gamena 'one of a pair or group'
 Enclitic -gamena 'one of a pair or group' functions in much the same way
as do -gara 'one of a pair' and mal]gan 'one of many' in Dyirbal (Dixon, 1972:
51-2; 230-231, 260 - 261). Dixon describes gara and mal]gan as primarily noun
suffixes. But the Dyirbal 'terms inflect to show Dative and Genitive case, unlike
Emmi -gamena, whk1h is invariable.
",56.35924530029297,0,0.892955088531988," Hamilton's second most favoured cluster is [APIC] [LAM]. This
cluster is also common in Emmi, e.g. windjerre 'steal'. Hamilton's least
favoured clusters are [SON] [SON], and amongst these he sets up the
 hierarchy
 (Hamilton)
NAS+NAS LIQ+NAS LIQ+GLID ._ENAS+GLIDE
More marked
The same clusters, in the same order of frequency, are the least
favoured consonant clusters in the Emmi corpus.

 Chapter Three
 Nominal Morphology
:3 .0 The grammatical word
In Emmi, a grammatical word consists of a lexical stem plus affixes
and/or enclitics. Each grammatical word also qualifies as a phonological word, in
that it can occur independently and bear primary stress.
",54.11627197265625,0,0.8192735542235242,"In (3-39) - (3-40), yene means 'beside'.In both utterances, yene modifies a
complex NP. In (3-39), this NP is a list of juxtaposed referents:
3-39geminya-mede""""'y=:en""""'e=--.:.:k=an:::;d::;.:u=-=d::.aw~!l.l=-=m.:.:u:.:.k=u
3AUG.S.R.come out+UAUG LOC man allwoman
yeremarbuk
child sprout
 'They both come out beside all the men, women and half-grown children'
 (T4:24)
 3-40gunin+medeyene nga demi
 3AUG.S.Rsit+UAUG LOC 3MIN.F.PRO side
yene errgi-nga=nhdha
LOC mother-3MIN.DAT.F=really
 'They are both sittii'lg there by her mother's side, really beside her mother.'
 (T2:12)
 114
In (3-40), yene modifies the complex NP nga demi 'her side'. The
 cardinal pronoun nga 'she' and body-part noun demi 'side' are juxtaposed in the
 construction usual to express inalienable possession, here of a body-part. The
 alternative word orders demi nga yene and yene demi nga were equally
 acceptable to speakers and made no difference in meaning. The first nga in the
 utterance is a free pronoun, but the second is a bound pronominal 'to/for her'
affixed to errgi 'mother' in another possessive construction. Like other nouns
denoting blood-kin, errgi 'mother' inflects for person, e.g. errgi-nbe (mother-to
you) 'your mother', errgi-na (mother-to hlm) 'his mother'.
",17.670217514038086,1,0.7874251843759228," The same complex morphemes also mark augmented number on nouns,
Cardinal pronouns and Deictics, where they also bear secondary stress., e.g.
ngada+mede ['~adamede] 'two of us'.
nganggu+nganya flJ81Jl)9UIJaJla] 'we four or more women, including
addressee';
wida+ninya ['w1danipa] 'They, consisting of four or more men'.
yuwanya+ngamen+mede ('juwapal)amenmede] \hose two men and one
 woman in the distance;
 yawanya+nemen+nganya ['jawapanemern:iapa) \hose four or more women
 plus OL~ man that I mentioned'.
 2-65 meyidjagundinyi tjipelh+mede
two3AUG.A.R.elbowRECIyoung girl+UAUG
'The two young girls elbow each other.' (T2:11)
In Emmi, each serial construction comprises two or more separate
 grammatical words. Two of these words must be inflected verbs, the second of
 which loses its phonological independence, and be~omes part of the preceding
 phonological word, which is often, but not necessarily, the main verb, (cf (2-68),
 sharing a single primary stress. The second inflected verb lt>~es its primary stress.
 For instance, in the serial c1nstruction shown in (2-66), th~ fo..fiected verb wadja
'2MIN.S.IR.walk!' occurs twice. The first wadja bears p,tlmary stress; th(~
second wadja carries secondary stress, behaving like a compoimd noun, as part
of a single phonological word.

 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
 enclitic, -(e)nhdheni marks an event as having happened just before the
 moment of speech, as in (7-73).

 enclitic, and the combination of Purposive and Perfective enclitics. Its
 :function in th~se ordered co-occurrences - it always precedes these
 particular enciitics - is to bring the event described closer to the .moment of
 speaking. For instance, when co-occurring with -(e)yi, the Perfective
