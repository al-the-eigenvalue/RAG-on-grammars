GRAMMATICAL SUFFIXES
1. There are ten suffixes which,when attached to words,change
their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,
etc.)and sometimes their grammaticalfunction(noun, verb,
etc.).
2. The suffix -x (sometimes -k) derivesa word that refers to a
thing,place,or activity that is touched by or affected by the
original word,or that is in some way a consequence of the origi-
