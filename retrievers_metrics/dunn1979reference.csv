GRAMMATICAL SUFFIXES
1. There are ten suffixes which,when attached to words,change
their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,
etc.)and sometimes their grammaticalfunction(noun, verb,
etc.).
2. The suffix -x (sometimes -k) derivesa word that refers to a
thing,place,or activity that is touched by or affected by the
original word,or that is in some way a consequence of the origi-
nal word.","The subjects of intransitive sentences

GRAMMATICAL SUFFIXES
1. There are ten suffixes which,when attached to words,change
their grammatical relationships(actor, recipient of action,
etc.)and sometimes their grammaticalfunction(noun, verb,
etc.).
2. The suffix -x (sometimes -k) derivesa word that refers to a
thing,place,or activity that is touched by or affected by the
original word,or that is in some way a consequence of the origi-
nal word.",54.1241455078125,0,0.5548512627306811,"Vowels aresometimes insertedinto consonantclusters in order
