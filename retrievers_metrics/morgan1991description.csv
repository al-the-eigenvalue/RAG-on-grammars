VSO, and SVO. Just looking at the text for clausal examples, rather looking at whole
sentences, one can find four examples of the order VOS in the text, one example of the
order VSO, and one example of the order SVO. These are the only straightforward exam-
ples of clauses in the text where there is both a lexical subject and a lexical object in the
same Clause. In an English text of the same length and similar content, one would expect
many examples of clauses with both a subject noun and an object noun in the same clause,
and most if not all of them would be of the order SVO. Notably, the English translation of
the edited form of the Chief and Ogress Text, in its clause-by-clause format , does not
count as a good example of such an English text, because it closely follows the Kutenai text
and avoids the occurrence of two lexical arguments in the same clause. In this somewhat
artificial English translation of the text, there are many examples where there is a pronom-
inal subject and a pronominal object together in the same clause, but this is unavoidable
because of the requirements of English grammar and the fact that every Kutenai verbal stem
in a text has at least an unmarked pronominal subject.

 There are other instances of the sequence of words /kwitqakaku¢a¢/ in the text,
in this same order, and not as direct quotes from Constable Pritchard as in WO.17 here.
The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument
4.1Kutenai Word Order407
One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not

same Clause. In an English text of the same length and similar content, one would expect
many examples of clauses with both a subject noun and an object noun in the same clause,
and most if not all of them would be of the order SVO. Notably, the English translation of
the edited form of the Chief and Ogress Text, in its clause-by-clause format , does not
count as a good example of such an English text, because it closely follows the Kutenai text
and avoids the occurrence of two lexical arguments in the same clause. In this somewhat
artificial English translation of the text, there are many examples where there is a pronom-
inal subject and a pronominal object together in the same clause, but this is unavoidable
because of the requirements of English grammar and the fact that every Kutenai verbal stem
in a text has at least an unmarked pronominal subject.
","At the other
 extreme, there are languages like the Coos languages which evidently use word order
 exclusively for discourse pragmatic purposes, rather than to identify the syntactic categories
 of sentence constituents. Because of this, the notion that these languages have a basic
 word order may not be applicable. Kutenai seem to be like the Salishan languages in
 having some use of word order, as a device to code information about syntactic structure,
 although word order primarily codes discourse pragmatic information.

preceded by the determiner /ni?/. The standard translation of /ni ?/ is ‘the’, but the
Kutenai determiner /ni ?/ is more specifically anaphoric than the English definite article.
This makes the subject of the VSO clause, below, more marked in discourse pragmatic
terms, in this particular way, than the subject of the VOS clause, above. This suggests that
in Kutenai the order VSO is not only less common than the order VOS, but is also more

not clearly a pronominal suffix on a par with the other pronominal suffixes.

even a common order, but just the least mark order of these constituents in discourse
pragmatic terms. For some languages, word order is evidently entirely a matter of Dis-
course Pragmatics and for such languages there is apparently no basic word order, since
each possible arrangement of subject, object, and verb in a clause is marked in discourse
pragmatic terms, and has a specific discourse pragmatic function. This has been argued to
 be the case for Hanis Coos, and a number of other languages, by Mithun (1984). Research
 by the present author on Miluk Coos indicates that this is also equally true for Miluk. In
 these two Coos languages, there are VOS, VSO, SVO, SOV, OVS, and OSV clauses. The
 occurrence of each order can be explained by discourse pragmatic principles, without ac-
 tually resorting to the notion that the language has a basic word order.

Verbal Phrase-Subject Nominal Phrase-Object Nominal Phrase, or VOS. This is a more
common arrangement of lexical subject, verbal stem, and lexical object than any of the
other arrangements of these three constituents. VOS may be the most common order,
however, as much for discourse pragmatic reasons as for non-discourse pragmatic syntac-
tic reasons. VOS may simply be the most called for order on discourse pragmatic grounds,
rather than being a genuinely neutral order. In the rare cases where there is a lexical subject

 There are other instances of the sequence of words /kwitqakaku¢a¢/ in the text,
in this same order, and not as direct quotes from Constable Pritchard as in WO.17 here.
The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument
4.1Kutenai Word Order407
One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not
some Dependent-Head order such as Relative Clause-Noun or Adjective-Noun.

 extreme, there are languages like the Coos languages which evidently use word order
 exclusively for discourse pragmatic purposes, rather than to identify the syntactic categories
 of sentence constituents. Because of this, the notion that these languages have a basic

 In nominal phrases in Kutenai where deictic words, the quantitative word /api?/, or

 to see the ostensible modifier as fundamentally or alternatively a pronoun, and therefore
 fundamentally a nominal stem in its own right. The modifying word is also a proclitic
 element on the following word and a part of the same nominal phrase. If nominal stems are
 subordinate predications, as is assumed here, then the deictic words, the quantitative

comparability of the various constructions in Kutenai where one word or phrase modifies a

Dependent-Head word orders represented by the ostensibly modifying constructions are

actually the same order as the VS order in WO.15, parts (a) and (b). Exactly the same
segmental morphemes are involved in (b) and (c). The morphological difference between
(b) and (c) lies in the matter of intonation. The interrogative k-form of the verbal stem in
(b) has a rising interrogative intonation, while the relative clause k-form of the stem in (c)
has a falling indicative intonation. In all three constructions, the most common order and
least marked order in discourse pragmatic terms is for the verbal stem whether indicative,
interrogative, or relative to precede the nominal stem. In all three constructions, the nomi-
 nal stern is coreferent to, and in apposition to, the actual subject of the verbal stem, which
 is a third person zero affix on the verbal stem.!3

The following text examples, from the Constable Pritchard Text, contain constructions
functionally similar to the one in WO.15, part (c), above,where a relative clause type k-
form precedes and ostensibly modifies a nominal stem. The clause in WO.16, part (d) is of
a relative clause type k-form preceding and ostensibly modifying a lexicalized k-form. A
literal meaning of the second k-form, at one level of analysis, is ‘that he/she/it has a badge,
that they have badges’. It is also a lexical item meaning ‘policeman’. In morphological
terms it remains a k-form, in spite of being lexicalized, in that it does not take possessive
affixation as nominal stems do.

 There are other instances of the sequence of words /kwitqakaku¢a¢/ in the text,
in this same order, and not as direct quotes from Constable Pritchard as in WO.17 here.
The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument
4.1Kutenai Word Order407
One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not
some Dependent-Head order such as Relative Clause-Noun or Adjective-Noun.

 There are other instances of the sequence of words /kwitqakaku¢a¢/ in the text,
in this same order, and not as direct quotes from Constable Pritchard as in WO.17 here.
The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument
4.1Kutenai Word Order407
One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not
some Dependent-Head order such as Relative Clause-Noun or Adjective-Noun.
",75.28800964355469,"One possibility explored by Dryer is that the ending /-apS/ is a single morpheme and
that the forms with it are genuinely passive, where the patient has become a syntactic sub-
ject. Although the sentences here are elicited, which introduces the influence of English
 word order, at least to a small extent, these examples are interesting for the study of Kute-
 nai word order in that, in examples HRO.4 and HRO.5, lexical arguments representing
 patients actually occur preverbally in sentences which were accepted as grammatical by a
 Kutenai elder. The same elder, on an earlier occasion’orking with the author, questioned
 the grammaticality of OSV word orders in sentences which could only be translated as
 active sentences in English. In that session, direct elicitation based on English sentences
 was avoided, but, of course, OVS sentences are not grammatical in any event in English,
 although Patient-Verb-Agent sentences are grammatical in English, but only when they are
 passive.

ples of clauses in the text where there is both a lexical subject and a lexical object in the
same Clause. In an English text of the same length and similar content, one would expect
many examples of clauses with both a subject noun and an object noun in the same clause,
and most if not all of them would be of the order SVO. Notably, the English translation of
the edited form of the Chief and Ogress Text, in its clause-by-clause format , does not
count as a good example of such an English text, because it closely follows the Kutenai text
and avoids the occurrence of two lexical arguments in the same clause. In this somewhat
artificial English translation of the text, there are many examples where there is a pronom-
inal subject and a pronominal object together in the same clause, but this is unavoidable
because of the requirements of English grammar and the fact that every Kutenai verbal stem
in a text has at least an unmarked pronominal subject.

 There are other instances of the sequence of words /kwitqakaku¢a¢/ in the text,

The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument

This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where

form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a

In contrast, Kutenai word order at the phrase level (i.e. the arrangement of words within

matter of the requirements syntactic structure, rather than any choices offered by discourse
pragmatics. Moreover, even phrases in Kutenai which consist of several words generally
 sound like a single long word, at least judging the matter from the standpoint of English.

 In nominal phrases in Kutenai where deictic words, the quantitative word /api?/, or
the determiner /ni ?/ ‘the’ precede a nominal stem, ostensibly modifying it, it is possible
 to see the ostensible modifier as fundamentally or alternatively a pronoun, and therefore
 fundamentally a nominal stem in its own right. The modifying word is also a proclitic
 element on the following word and a part of the same nominal phrase. If nominal stems are
 subordinate predications, as is assumed here, then the deictic words, the quantitative
 4.1Kutenai Word Order 413
/ api ?/, and the determiner /ni ?/ ‘the’ are each specialized kinds of predications. The
comparability of the various constructions in Kutenai where one word or phrase modifies a
following word or phrase and the further comparability of these constructions to Verbal
Stem-Lexical Subject construction seen above in WO.15 makes it questionable that the
Dependent-Head word orders represented by the ostensibly modifying constructions are
very fundamental or old in the language. It may be that in diachronic terms the Dependent-
Head constructions are derivative of a basic Head-Dependent order.

The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument

One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order

 There are other instances of the sequence of words /kwitqakaku¢a¢/ in the text,
in this same order, and not as direct quotes from Constable Pritchard as in WO.17 here.
The basic order of words for this type of construction in Kutenai is for the ostensibly mod-
ifying and most verb-like k-form to precede the lexicalized and most noun-like k-form. It
is not quite safe to say that these examples represent an order of Relative Clause-Noun,
much less that they represent an order of Adjective-Noun. For one thing, the adjectival
verbal stem /wi¢qa/ ‘to be big' is an adjectival verbal stem, not an adjective. For an-
other thing, the lexicalized k-forms are not nominal stems, much less nouns in the sense
that the word ‘noun’ has in English grammar and generally elsewhere. Nonetheless, lex-
icalized k-forms, and also k-forms which represent ad hoc nominalizations (such as /k,
wid¢qa/ ‘the he/she/it who is big, the they who are big’) are each potentially nominal
phrases, certainly in semantic terms, and there is a pattern here of an ostensibly modifying
phrase preceding a nominal phrase (i.e. preceding a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form).
This was already seen above in example WO.15, part (c), where a relative clause type k-
form precedes a nominal phrase consisting of a nominal stem.!7
 17 One thing which may have to be considered here is that the preceding and ostensibly
modifying k-form may not really constitute a separate phrase from the following nominal
phrase which it appears to modify. There may be a clitic-like relationship between the two
phrases so that they constitute an single compound nominal phrase. This would be a par-
allel to the commonly occurring type of verbal phrase where a clitic pronoun /hu,/ First
Person, or /hin,/ Second Person, representing the subject (a dependent argument) of the
verbal phrase is proclitic to the verbal stem which is the head of the construction. This is a
 Dependent-Head order, and the only possible order if the dependent pronominal argument
4.1Kutenai Word Order407
One can generalize that Kutenai has the order Head-Dependent as a basic word order.
This is certainly true for the arrangement of verbal stems and their lexical arguments, where
the basic word order is evidently VOS. The type of construction where a modifying k-
form precedes a nominal stem or lexicalized k-form seemingly has an opposite basic order
of Dependent-Head, but all the lexical stems involved are inflected stems which each have a
subject in the form of a zero third person pronominal affix, so the nominal stem or k-form
which follows the ostensibly modifying k-form is coreferent and in apposition to the
subject of a preceding verbal stem. In these terms, the order of lexical words is VS and not
some Dependent-Head order such as Relative Clause-Noun or Adjective-Noun.
",tensor([34.1862]),"One possibility explored by Dryer is that the ending /-apS/ is a single morpheme and
that the forms with it are genuinely passive, where the patient has become a syntactic sub-
ject. Although the sentences here are elicited, which introduces the influence of English
 word order, at least to a small extent, these examples are interesting for the study of Kute-
 nai word order in that, in examples HRO.4 and HRO.5, lexical arguments representing
 patients actually occur preverbally in sentences which were accepted as grammatical by a
 Kutenai elder. The same elder, on an earlier occasion’orking with the author, questioned
 the grammaticality of OSV word orders in sentences which could only be translated as
 active sentences in English. In that session, direct elicitation based on English sentences
 was avoided, but, of course, OVS sentences are not grammatical in any event in English,
 although Patient-Verb-Agent sentences are grammatical in English, but only when they are
 passive.

tence level (i.e. the arrangement of clauses within sentences), and it is also largely a matter
of discourse pragmatics at the clause level (i.e. the arrangement of phrases within clauses).
In contrast, Kutenai word order at the phrase level (i.e. the arrangement of words within
phrases) is relatively fixed. At the phrase level, word order in Kutenai is almost entirely a
matter of the requirements syntactic structure, rather than any choices offered by discourse
pragmatics. Moreover, even phrases in Kutenai which consist of several words generally
 sound like a single long word, at least judging the matter from the standpoint of English.
Words within Kutenai phrasesare strung together with cliticization boundaries, making
 Kutenai phrasal syntax very much like word morphology.

",63.72831344604492,"Notably, example WO.11 above, a VOS clause, has the same basic meaning as the
 clause in example WO.12, just below, which is the one VSO clause found in the text. One
 difference between the two clauses is that the subject noun in the VSO clause below is
 preceded by the determiner /ni?/. The standard translation of /ni?/ is 'the', but the
 Kutenai determiner /ni?/ is more specifically anaphoric than the English definite article.
 This makes the subject of the VSO clause, below, more marked in discourse pragmatic
 terms, in this particular way, than the subject of the VOS clause, above. This suggests that
 in Kutenai the order VSO is not only less common than the order VOS, but is also more
4.1 Kutenai Word Order 399
marked in discourse pragmatic terms than the order VOS is. The one example of an SVO
clause found in the text, which is presented as example WO.13, further below, also has a
subject nominal stem modified by the anaphoric Kutenai determiner /ni?/. It is a fact,
though, that two of the four VOS clauses in the text also have their subject nominal stems
preceded by the determiner /ni?/.
