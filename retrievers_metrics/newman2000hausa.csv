3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 9.3.1. Grade 5 with indirect objects
 A peculiarity of gr5 verbs concerns the use and position of d& when the sentence contains an indirect
 object (i.0.). (For purposes of the exposition here, I shall refer to the thematic direct object as d.o. even
 when it syntactically consists of da and an obliqueobject.)Withpronoun i.o.’s, the situation is
 straightforward. The word order is V + i.o. + d.o.

2.3. Subject fronting(topicalization)
The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa
(elsewhere), are allowed with intransitive as well as transitive verbs. They occur immediately after the
verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,

Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa
(elsewhere), are allowed with intransitive as well as transitive verbs. They occur immediately after the
verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,
the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa
(elsewhere), are allowed with intransitive as well as transitive verbs. They occur immediately after the
verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,
the order is necessarily i.o. + d.o., e.g.,

 the suffix. Four of the derived nouns have all H tone; the others have H-L tone: the choice is lexically
 determined and cannot be accounted for by general rule. One example (rare, but listed in the dictionaries)

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 With possessed nouns, the typical order is N + possessor + numeral, e.g.,
 matansa hudu_ his four wives (lit. wives.his four),m6técinmd shida our six cars (lit. cars.our six)
 One can reverse the order and have the numeral before the possessive (in which case one has to use an
 independent possessive). This is less common and is more highly marked than the possessive plus
 numeral order. Examples:

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

Indirect objects, which syntactically make use of the markers ma- (before personal pronouns) and wa

verb and before other arguments in the VP. Thus, when a sentence has both direct and indirect objects,

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house
Kanjamammen fufsina =fuFsina Kanjamamméthin prisoner
tsattsamaf fura =fura tsattsamasour fura
makékén ditsé =diitsé makéké huge stone
risassun ¢akuna =dakuna risassii razed rooms
Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

 when it syntactically consists of da and an obliqueobject.)Withpronoun i.o.’s, the situation is
 straightforward. The word order is V + i.o. + d.o.

morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

3.2. Attributive adjectives
3.2.1. Alternative word orders
Simple, single-word adjectives occur both before and after the head noun. Prenominal adjective
obligatorily connect to the head by means of a genitive linker (-n or -f, depending on number an
gender); postnominal adjectives are immediately juxtaposed to the head noun, e.g.,
farin gida (lit. white.L house)= gida fart (lit. house white)white house

Generally speaking, noun phrases with the two orders have the same essential meanings, although ther
are a few exceptions, e.g., gwamna ts6hd ‘old governor’ vs. tshon gwamna ‘former governor (or ol
governor)’. Differences do exist, however, but at the pragmatic/stylistic level. Both orders are norma
and quite common, although it is probably true that in the everyday language the prenominal adjective 
the less marked of the two, i.e., postnominal simple adjectives tend to add a certain degree of emphasi
or contrastiveness. Significantly, in compounds consisting of an adjective and a noun, the adjectiv
always occurs prenominally, e.g., baRin-cikt‘sadness; jealousy’ (lit. black.L belly), not **ciki-baRI.

If the subject X of an equational sentence is focused, the STAB is placed immediately after the X and taurardwa cé, [ita I

pleonastic pronoun described above in §4 is commonly used along with focused NPs. Examples:

epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

12. FUTURE
In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should
 [za talgyt Wanke kv
She will v
be written as two words, except in the case of the contractions. The main reason given for this
rule-—which does not strike me as persuasive—is that the two elements of the PAC can be separated by a ba [24 md} fyt j@ su

this is not possible with other PACs, e.g., **yaushé su k6é ka dawé (lit. when they however pret

","Finally, I cannot begin to express the extent of my obligation to Dr. Philip Jaggar of the 
Oriental and African Studies, University of London. During his sabbatical year in Blooming
spent endless hours discussing the intricacies of Hausa phonology, morphology, and
discussions that often forced me to rethink analyses that I had been comfortable with or to consi
that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective
year in order to help me with the grammar. And later when I had completed what I thought was
draft, Phil provided a meticulous page by page reading of the entire grammar, catching
redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak
undoubtedly true that this grammar would have been finished sooner if Phil had not taken such a
in it; but it would have been a much inferior product. It is standard in academic books to acknowl
many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,
acknowledgement is invariably well deserved. In Phil’s case, however, the assistance that he
truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram
testimony to his friendship and his love of the Hausa language. What can I say but Phil (Malam

The normal word order in the adverbial phrase is tun da yaké ‘since’ followed by the embedded sentence,
e.g., [tun da yakaj [yarinyaf tana barcl] ‘[since] {the girl is sleeping]’. One can, however, extract the
subject from its regular position and move it to the front of the sentence as a topic or prementioned
element. The topicalization is generally marked by a modal particle or by an intonational break
(indicated in the examples by a comma), but it is also possible without. If the fronted item is the subject
of an equational sentence, an independent pronoun is optionally left in its place, e.g.,

that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective

redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

appears as a single consonant, in others (e.g., Sokoto) it is normally a geminate. Monoverbs insert an F:
epenthetic /y/ before the suffix, e.g., jayiké ‘draw up this way’ < ja ‘pull, draw’. As with simplesemal
polysyllabic gr4 verbs, there are two variants for the pre-noun C-form, one with a long final vowel andhave
 H-L-H tone and one with a short final vowel and H-L-L tone. Verbal nouns are formed with -wa (the tone
being subject to dialectal variation not restricted to this grade). Examples:

°AN: From the surface appearance,the combinationof (-ik-) and gr4 (-€) would appear to occur and‘
morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

12. FUTURE
In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should
 [za talgyt Wanke kv
She will v
be written as two words, except in the case of the contractions. The main reason given for this
rule-—which does not strike me as persuasive—is that the two elements of the PAC can be separated by a ba [24 md} fyt j@ su
We are nc
modal particle, e.g., z4 k6 sd daw6 ‘They however will return.” (lit. fut however they return), whereas
this is not possible with other PACs, e.g., **yaushé su k6é ka dawé (lit. when they however pret
[zAn]fyt gyara fust
return). The future uses the same PAC paradigm in the affirmative and in the negative.
",64.70841979980469," Some eleven nouns end in -k6. The suffix is added to the simple verbal base (with reduplication in
 some cases). Monosyllabic Ci verbs lengthen the vowel in order to add weight to the syllable preceding
 the suffix. Four of the derived nouns have all H tone; the others have H-L tone: the choice is lexically
 determined and cannot be accounted for by general rule. One example (rare, but listed in the dictionaries)
 is reported with an L-H-L pattern in addition to all H.

 some cases). Monosyllabic Ci verbs lengthen the vowel in order to add weight to the syllable preceding
 the suffix. Four of the derived nouns have all H tone; the others have H-L tone: the choice is lexically
 determined and cannot be accounted for by general rule. One example (rare, but listed in the dictionaries)
 is reported with an L-H-L pattern in addition to all H.

order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-

to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective

redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective

redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

that I had been unaware of. Although Phil was always good-natured about the amount of time h
to my project, it is clear that he unselfishly sacrificed progress on his own academic objective

redundancies, contradictions in analysis, infelicities in translations, and downright mistak

many colleagues, friends, and coworkers who helped out in some important way or other,

truly went beyond the ordinary. Phil’s deep involvement in the preparation of this gram

morphologically in that order. On the other hand, a few examples suggest that the combined -ikéF discn
suffix is attached to a stem that is already a derivative gr4 rather than to a simple base. Thus
 janyike ‘pull all here’ clearly comes from janyé gr4, not ja gr0, and ficcike ‘escape out here’ is
derived from the secondary grade ficcé gr4, with irregular gemination, not from the basic verb fita
gr3, which has a single medial consonant.

In conjoined senten:
The future PAC paradigm is presented in table 23. It is made up of a TAM za (etymologically derived fromappears in the PAC
a verb ‘to go’) followed by a wsp with default L tone. Note that the order TAM + wsp is the reverse of thethe bare wsp with d
order in other PACs. The 1s and 3m contracted forms z4n and z4i are much more common than the non-
contracted forms za ni and 24 ya. The standard orthography dictates that the z@ + wsp sequences should
